0 2018-08-23 23:59:45 Yes, Coconut Oil is pure poison. People should change their food habit and consume more of Subway sandwiches, McDonald burgers, KFC chicken products & wash them down with Coca-Cola & PepsiCo drinks to improve on their nourishment, health and longevity.
1 2018-08-23 23:59:36 Processed coconut oil differs from coconut as a whole food.
2 2018-08-23 23:59:31 So in this instance are they suggesting I smoke weed and use the oil? I already have my anxiety under control I just don't get why people suggest CBD oil when I say I don't smoke?
3 2018-08-23 23:59:20 Washed my face with my new green tea cleanser, put on a Korean beauty night cream, apricot cuticle oil on my nails. This is the most detailed my beauty regime has been in a long time. I feel pampered.

11 2018-08-23 23:58:00 He's still there but not running. The time to get MAGA candidates is the primary. So far the President's endorsed candidates have won the primaries.
12 2018-08-23 23:57:07 Nice rant Trump but don't forget Chris Watts is an American  who murdered his wife, unborn child and strangled his 3 and 4 year old daughters... ALLEGEDLY!!. Oh and then dumped them in a giant tank full of oil.
13 2018-08-23 23:56:47 My dad would kick my ass if I did that. He damn near fought me when I took it to another place for an oil change.
14 2018-08-23 23:56:41 Them: Tryna smoke?

Me: I don't smoke weed it triggers my anxiety.

Them: Have you tried CBD oil? It's like weed only you don't get high.

Me: Ok? What would I gain from that?
15 2018-08-23 23:56:33 But they're only successful as socialists during economic booms.  Once the boom goes away, or they take it away (witness Venezuela with vast oil reserves) then socialism turns to misery then horror.  Asshole dictators and violent governments sure have a way of being socialist!
16 2018-08-23 23:56:19 I get the same treatment from these Alberta bitumen-sucking supporters who attempt moral high ground against "Saudi oil" because 'beheadings', but zip to say about dying Indigenous kids & poisoned land/water for them in CDA, thx to CDN bitumen extraction.
17 2018-08-23 23:56:12 If you consume coconut oil in great quantities  like all excesses is not good , but don't say is poisonous..
18 2018-08-23 23:56:09 So MANY dots & tentacles. Comey, Mueller, & national security agencies have fought before w/#RedDemon of corrupt  GOP/Kremlin;  oil is greasing dirty wheel;  global change deniers are for melting ice/oil grab; it's not a "keep it tight, keep it close" operation...ergo...BOOM.

40 2018-08-23 23:55:55 We’ll be vastly different. Limited resources- like oil. Heavy world poverty and water insecurity. New disease or two. 3 recessions. Possible depression. 1 quasi like IRAQ war. Nuclear and Space arms race. Cyber Security war. AI war machines. Extreme weather #50YearsInTheFuture
41 2018-08-23 23:55:46 *applies coconut oil for premium dick pic*
42 2018-08-23 23:55:36 I actually give VERY small amounts to my cats in the winter. It helps their coats and also helps with hair balls. It's oil so of course it is full of fat and cholesterol. Everything in moderation. :) PS My cats LOVE it.
43 2018-08-23 23:55:28 McCain is still there and we can not replace Flake and Coker with the same anti -Trump republicans, because to me the are lower then a Democrat.
44 2018-08-23 23:55:16 And there are some oil colors I could get you. If you change your mind about the easel, do inform me
45 2018-08-23 23:55:05 Lmao mad  as hell if u get any dirt or oil on me lmao

47 2018-08-23 23:54:46 @repjimcooper @RepCohen @PhilBredesen Big Oil needs to include the full cost of its activities. 
*Extraction/Distribution
*Protection
*Environmental Impact
*Health insurance 
Then renewable energy becomes a bargain.
48 2018-08-23 23:54:42 The medical advice wasn't even in the ballpark. If he told her to drink CBD oil, at least it wouldn't have caused obvious harm.
49 2018-08-23 23:54:41  damn. Put some castor oil and try your luck before you shave it. Winter coming lol
50 2018-08-23 23:54:41 Dancing in cooked oil
51 2018-08-23 23:54:36 Please dont throw it out.  Coconut oil has amazing healing powers and it is good for you.
52 2018-08-23 23:54:34 A cigarette has over 1300 chemicals , vaping has only nicotine and nicotine is as caffeine there is no carcinogens in vape oil look on YouTube search Trump and vaping .
53 2018-08-23 23:54:23 My chain saw runs on 1:25 but instructions on the can state dilution up to 1:100 can be used.
It uses more oil lubricating the cutting chain than it does lubricating the engine.
54 2018-08-23 23:54:20 Big oil. Mostly 2 old shits

56 2018-08-23 23:53:54 Unavoidable climate disaster incoming. Nothing we can do to stop it... Humans are going to have to learn adapt to the changes heading their way.  We'll run out of oil before humans choose to end their dependency....
57 2018-08-23 23:53:44 So I had to exchange the camera b/c sensor oil and the salesperson is testing it and giving me dubious looks and, here’s the thing, you ain’t gonna see ‘em at f5 no matter how hard you look
58 2018-08-23 23:53:43 My beard oil smells like evergreens
59 2018-08-23 23:53:39 Why isn't the white house mentioning the dude who just murdered his pregnant wife, 2 small children and dumped their bodies in oil cans? Murder is only worth mentioning when a brown person does it?
60 2018-08-23 23:53:28 Those three are not on the ballot.
61 2018-08-23 23:53:06 I'm not sure what their prices are but our CBD oil tinctures start at $20, that might be a better value. Hope it will work for you!
62 2018-08-23 23:52:59 But coconut oil is pure poison! @PeterAttiaMD

67 2018-08-23 23:52:09 Don't forget, the big 12 officials will cheat us out of a gm this yr and you know I'm not joking they will literally cheat us out of a game this year just like they did at TCU last year.  we can still win the Big 12 at 8-1 despite the big oil corruption

75 2018-08-23 23:50:54 Yeah?! That's just two (2). They are (Tesla is) making 3000 a day soon (1m/year promised). Two lemons out of a million  are just shorty shorts double agents sabotaging forums, commissioned of Big Oil.

NB: satiric
76 2018-08-23 23:50:46 ... you were not gonna spend $650. XD

The easels are yes. The $650 paint set is a 'lol look how expensive oil paints can get' item.
77 2018-08-23 23:50:26 no honorable mention for our maligned softwood lumber industry
  or our decimated automobile manufacturers?

I'd mention oil, too
 ... but we've stifled that sector even more than the US has
78 2018-08-23 23:50:13 yo stop putting oil on sandwiches like jesus christ why you gotta go and taint my toppings with this sweaty ass bread

87 2018-08-23 23:49:25 The biggest problem is that the title of the article is clearly sensationalism/click bait, but the article literally just says: "Hey man. A diet in high saturated fats can be bad. Coconut oil isn't inherently good for you because of this. Please don't use it as a cure all."
88 2018-08-23 23:49:20 The oil/gas sheen on the water or our galactic overlords?? 
89 2018-08-23 23:49:05 These dirty Khaleeji Gulf Arab rulers can piss off with their dirty oil money.

I don't want any Gulf Arab takeover of Liverpool, regardless of the fact that Sheik Khaled is the cousin of Sheik Mansour, the City owner.
90 2018-08-23 23:49:01 Oh great the Rice Water Oil Cleanser clogged up my pores 
91 2018-08-23 23:48:52 I put lavender essential oil in my bath and I only put like 5 or 6 drops and soon as I got in this shit hit me. I’m already sleepy.
92 2018-08-23 23:48:50 Also one of the reasons commercial fried chicken from some cheap chicken joint is usually better than what you can make at home is it's fried in a pressure cooker. Am I gonna heat up boiling hot oil under pressure in my kitchen? NOPE.
93 2018-08-23 23:48:41 Looks like our protests are working in order for big oil to spend their precious money on an ad hominem advertisement targeted towards environmentalists!
94 2018-08-23 23:48:36 
95 2018-08-23 23:48:32 I knew you are a oil tycoon....
96 2018-08-23 23:48:30 .@BernieSanders hey Bern, look at your portfolio then get back to us. I am 99.9% sure you have an energy stock or two. The standard is no longer gold, but oil! #drillbabydrill
97 2018-08-23 23:48:26 Or u can get tumeric power cook it down wit some coconut oil add Blk pepper, it stains but it def works too lol
98 2018-08-23 23:48:26 たしかに強いけど保険で…ね。
99 2018-08-23 23:48:19 Are you stupid? Trump has put tougher sanctions on Russia then Obama ever dreamed of. He has also sanctioned personally Oleg Deripaska for his involvement in the Fusion GPS framing campaign. He has increased our natural gas and oil exploration which also hurts Russia. Wake up.
100 2018-08-23 23:48:14 When I see a pro-GOP commercial come on, let's say, the @lawrence O'Donnell show, it just strikes me as ironic and funny that the BAD guys are supporting the GOOD guys by buying airtime. So why can't the oil industry contribute to our campaigns? TOO liberal? Sorry. [Not sorry]
101 2018-08-23 23:48:00 That’s right. A renewable resource.  While environmentalists were paising the use of plastic bags in the ‘80s, people with brains were saying that you’re changing to something that’s non biodegradable and uses oil to produce. Paper bags degrade and enrich the soil.
102 2018-08-23 23:47:56 Rosemary essential oil is the best for improving concentration 
103 2018-08-23 23:47:55 Yo, boyfriend don't even know how to change oil in you think I'm worried about him 
104 2018-08-23 23:47:39 Messing around and frying some hamburger and sausage in some hot oil and these peppers and onions absorb the flavor so well. Y’all I’m on another level with this.

108 2018-08-23 23:47:00 Getting some oil canvas art for the crib
109 2018-08-23 23:46:12 What annoys me is the incessant focus on direct, government revenues **only** from Oil.
What about what it is actually used for and the thousands of industries that would collapse without a steady, affordable supply of it?
110 2018-08-23 23:46:09 If you get full synthetic oil I wouldn't worry about even going 10,000 miles between oil changes.  I drove my Mazda 3 for 205,000 miles before the clutch went and regularly got oil changes between 8,000-10,000 miles.
111 2018-08-23 23:46:08 Jojoba oil + water = 77 happy locs
112 2018-08-23 23:46:00 そうなんだ。今の5Ghz帯の無線ってめちゃ強いイメージあったわ
113 2018-08-23 23:45:56 i do not have context for techbro food that isn’t Soylent tbh. also it’s still weird that “weird mushroom oil” is now one of the signs of conspicuous consumption in the west.
114 2018-08-23 23:45:49 Big Oil doesn't care if the whole earth is covered by smog like Beijing. They complain a water powered car would disrupt our economy. When we run out of oil, or when earth becomes unlivable, how much will THAT disrupt the world's economy?
115 2018-08-23 23:45:43 pensaba que luiz escanuelas oil on canvas era un puto rabo que manera de flipar
116 2018-08-23 23:45:29 @Delta deplaned, we are already 40 min delayed. Going to be at least another 40 min. Oil pressure is the issue. Maybe if this plane wasn't 40 years old I could get home to see my family...
117 2018-08-23 23:45:26 ...It's almost like you literally didn't read any of the article.

The whole point is that a diet high in saturated fats isn't good for you.

Coconut Oil is high in saturated fats, like a lot of oils--So ushering it in as a "cure all", like a lot do, is naturally bad.
118 2018-08-23 23:45:22 Hydrating him was a challenge until we started on
@thenutribullet fresh or 1/2 the cup of frozen berries, cover with heavy whipping cream, strawberry yogurt and OJ to the brim. I throw in 1-2 tsp avocado oil.
He downs 24oz in one sitting and it hydrates him and gives him calories
119 2018-08-23 23:45:15 Fellas, we need to do something about this palm oil situation.
120 2018-08-23 23:45:15 Has to be Big Sky. Small populations, rural, western, ranching/oil. All those things point to card games and gambling as leisure activities.

We’re taking a trip to SD next summer, in part visiting a friend’s family ranch. I’m excited to learn about the card play scene there.

122 2018-08-23 23:45:03 I’m still cracking up about this tweet.
123 2018-08-23 23:45:02 can someone tell me where i can get some cbd oil??
124 2018-08-23 23:44:56 Mollie Tibbetts murder is heartbreaking but don't turn this into an immigration issue. Women are murdered every day in this country by legal citizens. Chris Watts put his children in oil drums after strangling them and their mother. Murder is Murder.
125 2018-08-23 23:44:52 Not a movie but just things in general:

- dungarees (& making them look good!) 
- sunlowers
- fine art with oil pastels (van gogh basically) 
- that warm feeling when you close your eyes and look at the sun
- good hugs 
- a genuinely good person (not an association but you are)

127 2018-08-23 23:44:26 My mom got an oil pen and my mom and dad are now eating cheesy potatoes on the couch watching family feud
128 2018-08-23 23:44:15 But first we have to have oil to ship. And most of what we have is unrefined bitumen. Build refineries in Alberta first, then sell it at the world price, not 1/3 off. And only ship it via regularly government-inspected pipelines. #cdnpoli 
129 2018-08-23 23:44:15 oil slick
130 2018-08-23 23:44:03 Oh yeah just think about the gymnasium... mostly-naked or fully nude dudes who just work out ALL DAY covered in oil and sweat, wholesomely wrestling and sporting with their sun bronzed perfectly toned bodies.
131 2018-08-23 23:43:47 Yeah sex is cool but have you ever checked the oil in a generator and oil comes shooting out? THATS AWESOOOOME
132 2018-08-23 23:43:28 Interesting! Local as in farmer's markets, etc. or is there such a thing as like, a regional certification for honey (as sometimes exists for olive oil)? Also, any source for that 90% number?
133 2018-08-23 23:43:18 I was cooking & oil splattered on my lip so now I have a blister on it to go with my outfit for tomorrows wedding, all I wanted was to to look fabulous WTF
134 2018-08-23 23:43:14 I got rid of mine with coconut oil. Like the pure stuff. Make sure it’s cool you can even put it in the fridge and then use it like you would a tampon you know and it should get rid of it. it’s worth a try
135 2018-08-23 23:43:09 Just saying liars does not make it so! It’s playground, politics! You need to provide the evidence for disproving their statement rather than pointing fingers and saying liars.  Btw they say they use all the whale, oil, blubber I suspect the skin and bone less so these days
136 2018-08-23 23:43:05 Not in the budget sorry had to make cuts in the "not oil and gas" sections.
137 2018-08-23 23:43:04 Damn my car hella spoiled....new set of tires, full tank of gas, car wash, oil change...imma test how much she love me...get ready bc Boutta put another 1,500 miles in 3 days on her again...we GON see who is the most down

140 2018-08-23 23:42:39 "In a large skillet, cook onion in 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat for 15-20 minutes or until onion is golden brown"
holy fuck twenty minutes lmao
141 2018-08-23 23:42:31 Cooking directions: take this out with pot holders so you don’t get burnt!

Me, an dumbass: takes it out of the microwave as it burns my hands like hot oil with only my bare hands and sheer force of will
142 2018-08-23 23:42:30 If nothing else, someday we will need what is left for machine oil.
143 2018-08-23 23:42:22 You’re a nutter if you would rather lose without oil money than win with it #LFC
144 2018-08-23 23:42:11 oh dang I didn't even realize it's a local chain. just imagine the burger a techbro eats, take off the goat cheese and truffle oil, and it's that.
145 2018-08-23 23:42:08 Hello oily skin beauties a great mask to absorb excess oil and impurities, shrink pores AND brighten skin is Bentonite Clay + Apple Cider Vinegar
146 2018-08-23 23:42:03 Coconut oil isthe worst oil in the
Entire universe
147 2018-08-23 23:41:59 Miller is a snake oil salesman. Nasty dude.
148 2018-08-23 23:41:45 Oil on #CAMxVAS
149 2018-08-23 23:41:28 Got anointed with oil and prayed for by a random black man  I guess he saw the struggle in my face
150 2018-08-23 23:41:19 You're right, somewhat. There is enough scientific research in India too, towards which oil is good/ok/ bad. So, the Heart docs say that ALL oils are bad in excess. We use a lot of Ghee( clarified butter) too. But moderation is the key. Followed by Genes, exercise, environment.
151 2018-08-23 23:41:09 Everytime I see my dad, he checks my oil. Everytime 
152 2018-08-23 23:41:04 You'll need more than medication after Brexit. LOL You didn't bother watching the video. It's important. You'll stop with all the crank conspiracy theories on oil and dollars. LOL
153 2018-08-23 23:40:57 I got mine from @BarkShop. I got the 300mg oil. There's a $10 off coupon code floating around somewhere, I think on @RetailMeNot.
154 2018-08-23 23:40:50 does anyone with dry skin want to take some of the oil off my face

156 2018-08-23 23:40:32 @fordnation Google Cannabis Oil Extract Bottles from 1850 and you'll get 9pgs of them.

157 2018-08-23 23:40:23 Was hitting my juul while checking my oil in my car and my mom saw smoke and asked if I was smoking weed and I immediately said no... so now I’m dropping my car off at the shop because she thinks my engine was on fire. Great
158 2018-08-23 23:40:18 サラダ油って体に悪いんですか？サラダなのに？
159 2018-08-23 23:39:42 Bet you never heard of someone’s ezpass getting stolen, but I think mine was today!!! I got my oil changed at the dealer and now it’s gone 
160 2018-08-23 23:39:27 My grand parents and parents have used coconut oil for all their life. I am using this as well. So please spare us this nonsense
161 2018-08-23 23:39:03 olive oil dip is the mvp of this
162 2018-08-23 23:39:02 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot
163 2018-08-23 23:39:01 But Anna has already spilt the sunflower oil.
164 2018-08-23 23:38:44 Oh really? Fuck this study! Another black propaganda of the lobbyists against coconut oil w/c is the best oil there is.

172 2018-08-23 23:37:04 I need my oil changed like asap 
173 2018-08-23 23:37:02 Alt-Rads, #WeGoTogetherLike peanut butter and motor oil.

175 2018-08-23 23:36:47 @KimTobinNBCLA enjoyed your report on @calpolypomona logo fight. #GraphicDesign is important to people & it is really great your reporting gives a voice to these students. Why #CPP wants to look like an oil company logo deserves a place on the news. Thank you @NBCLA #logofail
176 2018-08-23 23:36:43 Vinegar, oil and some parsley - next you tell me to deep fry mars bars...
177 2018-08-23 23:36:35 Just learned that a cooking oil spill is one of the worst things that can happen in modern life.
178 2018-08-23 23:36:33 Its like 100,000 for an oil change
179 2018-08-23 23:36:31 We had the DKW van in Stellenbosch. As far as I can remember it was a can of oil per tank.
When I went to army in Potchefstroom I saw a filling station with dedicated petrol pumps for the DKW.

182 2018-08-23 23:35:58 Veg oil best. If it's new (or old & food is sticking) rub a bit on the pan (sides too) and stick it in the oven upside down at 375 degrees for an hour. After that you only need to refresh it every few months. Oil the pan again lightly & put it on the burner till it kinda smokes.
183 2018-08-23 23:35:55 My oils have arrived and I'm enjoying a diffused Tea Tree , a little content mixed in coconut oil and on my body... and I mixed some peppermint into my Ionix Supreme... delicious!
184 2018-08-23 23:35:20 Blah blah blah.. neither would coal or oil industries. Tax and ratepayers have been paying those subsidies since the 70’s.
185 2018-08-23 23:35:14 Name one oil that contains fiber. Please?
186 2018-08-23 23:35:02 Along with oil changes, one of life’s great annoyances.

188 2018-08-23 23:34:32 cpd oil is oil from marijuana... basically it’s weed oil but without the thc (the part that gets you high). cpd helps with stress, head aches, anxiety, sleeping issues, pain etc
189 2018-08-23 23:34:28 The hair salon I’m at has a waiting area that only consists of a massage chair pointed at a wall mural of a New Zealand sunset, a zen water fountain, a vitamin D sun lamp, and an essential oil diffuser. 5 Stars.
190 2018-08-23 23:34:20 Agreed. But like Nandini says, it's really ok if used in moderation, like all oils. Human bodies & health depend so much on genes, environment, habits, exercise etc. Coconut is just a plant, like the Olive. Olive oil is good..in moderation. Any heart doctor will say it too..

193 2018-08-23 23:33:51 I agree with all of that except he isn’t a Buffoon.  He’s a blowhard braggart conman who sells snake oil to the snake oil Salemen. Everything he does is deliberate.  He shouts the loudest and he sues.  He is dangerous, but he isn’t a buffoon.  He takes us for buffoons though,
194 2018-08-23 23:33:34 Let me introduce you to Republicans McCain, Flake, Coker who would vote for impeachment in the House or Removal of the President and indictment if in the Senate. I can name more if you want. Only vote for Republicans who support President Trump.
195 2018-08-23 23:33:34 you ever think about how ancient roman men of a certain caste were probably incredibly clean and soft from all the bathing and olive oil and exfoliating strigiling. mmm
196 2018-08-23 23:33:31 Go change my oil!
197 2018-08-23 23:33:14 The fight scene in Iron Man 3 with all of Tony’s suits on the oil rig gets better and better every time I see it
198 2018-08-23 23:33:09 Walk, Sex, castor oil, birthing ball, membrane sweep! I tried everything and castor oil is what put me into labor.

203 2018-08-23 23:32:36 Cambridge Energy Research used consultant from MIT to advise at least 1 oil company about consequences of global warming on facilities on the Gulf. Feel sure other companies had access to same info. That was about 18 years ago. Not sure why industry ignored warnings.
204 2018-08-23 23:32:28 おはありー
205 2018-08-23 23:32:23 I love them grated and sautéed in olive oil with a bit of salt. Delicious. Though if you forget that you have eaten that many beets, your next poop will be very alarming.

220 2018-08-23 23:29:44 I hear you say it Rob, but I’m not seeing or feeling it.  I think you’re pushing you snake oil.
221 2018-08-23 23:29:41 Centralization of the means of communication, however for about a week until the soap has absorbed the oil.
222 2018-08-23 23:29:35 yep, got turned on to them about 3 years ago and it holds up so well. still trying to figure out the best way to season tho. Been using canola oil but not sure.
223 2018-08-23 23:29:33 By all means do, and please keep me in the loop too. I put small amounts of MCT oil in my coffee and I’m not going to stop b/c of this one study. Good luck my friend!

226 2018-08-23 23:29:28 @KarenKilgariff best plantar fasciitis remedy: massage castor oil into your foot and wear a sock over it to bed. Mine cleared up in 3 days! Also, slip into slippers with a heel (or a clog) when getting out of bed to prevent reinjuring the muscles first thing in the am 
227 2018-08-23 23:29:27 Ya, it's on the East Scotian slope. The part before that drop off was actually dry during the height of the last ice age. Hence all the oil from all the dead vegetation.
228 2018-08-23 23:29:14 I'm loving the utility balm over the oil but on days I'm just marinating at the house the oil is my way to go. I'm using Spiced citrus (balm) and temple smoke oil.

Yeah subsidized oil and gas, military, DARPA, megachurch tax exemptions....
I am pretty confident those all cost us more than planned Parenthood

235 2018-08-23 23:28:08 The "Harvard professor" (#karinmichels) is confusing the consumption of coconut oil with using the whole coconut as a suppository .. which could be dangerous.

239 2018-08-23 23:27:37 Obviously given the state of the economy, lower taxes, less regulation. Texas is now export oil.
240 2018-08-23 23:27:25 Nobody in science should be describing coconut oil as “pure poison”
241 2018-08-23 23:27:19 I’ve added more clean oil to the dirty oil. Lol. But I’ve watched videos of how to do car things and they get really in-depth
242 2018-08-23 23:26:59 I'm voting no matter what!! Always vote republican.
243 2018-08-23 23:26:49 I love chicken & dumplings in the winter. Roasted chicken breast with lemon, garlic, & olive oil. Spicy Butter chicken. Enchiladas. I like it so many ways!
244 2018-08-23 23:26:37 Have you changed your own oil?
245 2018-08-23 23:26:34 That said, the potential for cannabis derived drugs is near limitless and GW has IP that goes way beyond CBD oil. I think the key will be developing products/formulations that have very specific uses and are not easily mimicked.
246 2018-08-23 23:26:34 So why is it that when before you take a shower, you don't have to shit, but after you get right out, dry off, oil up and go to put on the panties that your ass decides " oh I need to evict these tenants."? #FuckMyBowels
247 2018-08-23 23:26:18 Vote for every Republican House and Senate candidate no matter how repugnant! If they are Republican they can't support impeachment derangement. If they are Dem they will!

258 2018-08-23 23:25:12 China owns half the oil and Iran is infiltrated everywhere.  Tumbalo!! 
259 2018-08-23 23:25:09 I’M DEF GONNA TALK MORE IN-DEPTH ABOUT THAT ON MY IG!! In general tho I have a 5 step routine atm: oil cleanser - water cleanser - toner - cream or sheet mask - sunscreen or sleeping mask! 
260 2018-08-23 23:24:52 yeah I was looking at lab tech positions

masters in geology working for 13.5 an hour at an offshore oil rig for 12hr shifts 2 weeks on 1 week off

fuck that and fuck oil
261 2018-08-23 23:24:40 Not all states
262 2018-08-23 23:24:38 I recommend it and the lemongrass body oil if you can find it. It smells nice & mosquitos hate it.
263 2018-08-23 23:23:53 If you guys could get a real opposition going that is semi competent, we might actually do something.  People are wary of an Iraq 2: En Espanol.

-oil country
-in our hemisphere

Normally we'd be all over that.

267 2018-08-23 23:23:24 Do you support coconut oil?
268 2018-08-23 23:23:24 That's because their  money comes from oil and they are throwing as much money to their masters in the middle East as they can. It all fits doesn't it? Their conduct makes perfect sense if they sold their souls to a Muslim master? I'll advance any theroy, anyone else have an idea
269 2018-08-23 23:23:19 Thank you for sharing a measured and fact-based article on the role of fats in nutrition and health in the midst of the heated debate about coconut oil. The importance of research and evidence cannot be understated.
270 2018-08-23 23:23:05 Broccoli sauteed in garlic and oil forever has my heart
271 2018-08-23 23:23:03 I love and believe in coconut oil. Some big pharma pay off guy is not changing my mind.
272 2018-08-23 23:22:52 So I found out that my hair doesn’t like when I use a creme with my wash n go. It likes only leave in conditioner, oil, and a gel lol
273 2018-08-23 23:22:35 Listening to #WhatsTheTee Mindful Hydration. When @michellevisage says “I even put CBD oil in my ’muji’” my mind instantly went in the gutter. I was over here taking notes on frankencense and CBD for my muji until she said oil diffuser 
274 2018-08-23 23:22:33 5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

289 2018-08-23 23:20:28 Nigeria had just discovered oil, ofcourse it was losing battle, it was 3years of steady declination and wearing down of the biafran army which were mostly not trained and use of child soldiers during the later years of the war.
290 2018-08-23 23:20:07 Is there anything sexier than slapping tons of rosehip seed oil on your face before you get in bed? No. There isn’t.
291 2018-08-23 23:20:02 The last two times I’ve gotten my oil changed I’ve gotten my car back with something broken and an unexpected $500 fix bill. I 100% believe oil change people are out to get me.
292 2018-08-23 23:19:52 Use some castor oil sis.
293 2018-08-23 23:19:50 War of course.

I don't know if it will actually happen. Lots of furious moves behind scenes. BUT, if it does,  has practically promised 2 mine the straits of Hormuz.

It MIGHT actually be intent of SOMEBODY 2 provoke exactly that, 2 trigger oil panic.

297 2018-08-23 23:19:16 Did arabs make it possible to refine oil... just asking for a friend. Did Africa have any other resources other than diamonds (somthing that instead even valuable but there is a controlled supply in the markets) what have any of these places done recently... jack and you know it
298 2018-08-23 23:19:06 Nah lol I need burning oil for my room
299 2018-08-23 23:19:01 @BabestationTV I enjoyed every second of Dannii’s #Babyoil antics before now noticing my fav @AshleyEmmax is in the building and so Is baby oil... imagine if we got her soaked from top to bottom aswell
300 2018-08-23 23:18:55 Thanks, hopefully they can all wake up and smell the fresh oil coming out.
301 2018-08-23 23:18:38 Since when were the Saudi’s to be trusted in the first place ?? Why the hell are we still buying their oil or dealing with them at all ??
302 2018-08-23 23:18:30 I think I convinced my dad to start using cbd oil for all his pain
303 2018-08-23 23:18:30 level of stupidity is unreal all oil is in Gers. Gers is fully supported by SNP, Scot gov ,sturgeon McKay swinney etc. FFS even wings ! . But you conspiracy clowns say they’re all lying cause you ain’t got a clue what your talking about. So who lied you or sturgeon. My £ on you

305 2018-08-23 23:18:25 They're great! My favorite leaked lyrics so far are:

I fucked my own dick,
Now I'm feeling sick,
Give me that brick,
I'll show you a trick,
Where I smash my balls,
And make an oil slick!

Pure poetry, man!

308 2018-08-23 23:17:35 I've been "micro-dosing" with marijuana oil for most of the summer.  I rarely really feel it, but I have definitely noticed two things: time seems to slow down, and I get a lot more done.
309 2018-08-23 23:17:24 ありえん眠み！？
310 2018-08-23 23:17:22 WHY are these so expensive? So many more eating dairy free now the cost need only be buttons between prices. Sm addition for coconut milk. AND recently told no such thing as sustainable PALM OIL. still the cause of numerous fires?? Any help with these please?
311 2018-08-23 23:17:19 Look, I'm not some hardcore Kerry fan. All I'm saying, however, is that HRC was definitively more hawkish, as evidenced by all the things she did and that she is proud of even today. That's it. I have no snake oil to sell.
312 2018-08-23 23:17:19 Yeah they won’t be so bad after and the oil will help fade them just keep it moisturized is the key so the skin isn’t like dry stretching if that makes sense
313 2018-08-23 23:17:10 Just found out my patient was denied longterm care because she is on cannabis oil. The home, Kippling Acres, refuses to let her in unless she takes pharmaceuticals only. We are trying to get this 87yo off her opiates. This is completely unacceptable. @celliottability @CFAMMcan
314 2018-08-23 23:17:09 "Oh yeah, please don't stare for too long, that's Larry. Had a bit of a tumble, fell down the stairs into a glass pane while hot oil was carried out of the kitchen. Oh the arm? No, that was long prior to that."
315 2018-08-23 23:17:08 I’m paying less than $250 for all 4 brakes , new rotors in the front and my oil change 
316 2018-08-23 23:17:08 Can't neglect changing the transmission oil. Car only ran 30k miles and yet that oil was completely black. Got to keep the trans running smooth.

318 2018-08-23 23:17:07 @AMSOILINC rules.  Thanks Scott for the oil and the good service!!!
319 2018-08-23 23:17:07 Good question! I’d recommend @mtneerbrand beard oil to help beard hair health from the very get go. Then I’d recommend taking cold showers to increase testosterone, thus increasing beard growth. Take your time, be patient w it. Comb and wash often.

325 2018-08-23 23:16:33 CAUTION: I recently took my E300 in for service, it took them SIX days to complete a routine oil change…During that time, their loaner got a scratch on the passenger door and they are now trying to gouge me $1000 for repairs on top of the $415 they charged me for the oil change.
326 2018-08-23 23:16:28 ぽはようです！
327 2018-08-23 23:16:25 this lavender oil is actually working
328 2018-08-23 23:16:24 Absolutely. Even in the non-political examples, like the latest coconut oil/ Harvard professor uproar.
329 2018-08-23 23:16:22 Before you throw that coconut oil away, also remember that Harvard once led the charge against fats and in favor of sugar.

341 2018-08-23 23:14:20 Omg I remember when I dropped my blackberry in the deep fryer whilst frying plantain. My dad forced me to use the phone for a year. It had oil bubbles in the screen and everything 
342 2018-08-23 23:14:16 If Idris Elba could carve a really beautiful wooden spoon, bring out the grain of the wood with a little oil. Maybe make a wooden bowl to go with it. Play a little harmonica, let you spontaneously jump on his back for a cuddle, he’d be perfect.

350 2018-08-23 23:13:22 Your jealousy of oil executives is showing. Wind energy kills a quarter of 1 million birds annually in the US. It’s noisy and it’s a visual eye sore destroying many landscapes. The solar farm in the Mojave Desert killed 30,000 birds last year. And that’s just one farm.
351 2018-08-23 23:13:22 Pls explain why "we" are suppose to develop something exclusively for a religious group? How about the ongoing tale of muslim superiority.. & billions of oil $$ found for free in the epicenter of that stupid religion? Questions, oh questions.. 
352 2018-08-23 23:13:15 #mining $GLD #energy #economy $ES $OIL We need people like Frances. She works in land rehab, so she’s in charge of restoring, replanting and returning the land to the way it was before a mine was there. It’s tough but rewarding work and it’s an essential part of the process.…
353 2018-08-23 23:13:12  Oh yes, oil companies fund all the 31,000 scientists who are skeptics. What a BS claim.
354 2018-08-23 23:13:02 ぽはよーです
355 2018-08-23 23:12:56 LOL* Not calling this impossible but the foundation of modern concrete is Lye. Very destructive of organic material. That being said, hemp has a very high oil content that could possibly act to protect it. Crete can cause burns on skin when wet and cause a chronic condition.

Let the oil companies do what they want and let the renewable energy companies keep advancing.
They are getting better and eventually will be a choice the saves people money and help the environment.

#Britain and #Norway "North Sea Oil" exported 4.65 MMBD
Now exports have fallen to 2 ..

Mexico and Venezuela exported 3.9 MMBD
now it is 2.6 ..

The most important challenges that will face #oil in the future are:
- depletion 
- low investment !

Blended and served. Added a little cinnamon and coconut milk as well.
Not to bed really ... I'm definitely going to have to experiment more with other additional flavors. I needed the extra fat today .. was running low.

375 2018-08-23 23:10:11 Hope they drill for oil on your street
376 2018-08-23 23:10:10 No mention of science. Sociology, even if you call it social science, is not science. The issue is actual science being fought by lobbyist-lead Conservatives who play up to anti-intellectualism to disregard the threats of everything - Tobacco, Lead, Coal, Oil, America on fire.
377 2018-08-23 23:10:02 I agree it’s unclear but I always thought it was because Chloe pushed him out of the way when the chef pushed the oil over.

379 2018-08-23 23:09:55 A fan could do what Mourinho does. Fantasy football. Give him 5 or 10 billion and eventually he’ll topple the big oil club. Class of ‘92 won’t happen again. What do Man U do with their 27 world class training pitches? The kids aren’t alright.
380 2018-08-23 23:09:39 Followed you
381 2018-08-23 23:09:36 You on a table with oil baby?
382 2018-08-23 23:09:31 OK. You had a writing career after being an executive with Shell Oil and you're from Richmond. And you dismiss @OwenJones84 as a class warrior for pointing out the social spectrum of people earning a living from writing/journalism is very narrow.....
383 2018-08-23 23:09:00 When you look at Lac Megantic or Lake Wabamum I still prefer pipelines. Either way oil will be produced, may as well have it piped safely

390 2018-08-23 23:07:44 Idk I never tried that I just did the bio oil and it worked really well. They say stretch marks are genetic but my mom and sis have them all over and I didn’t get 1 so it must have worked.
391 2018-08-23 23:07:17 I agree - bio oil is fab 
392 2018-08-23 23:07:15 I told my dad to buy me some almonds and he came back with olive oil smh
393 2018-08-23 23:07:04 And Jacob Rothschild, powerful banker. Also the ex head of the CIA and Senior Israeli ex military man. Google Genie for all the gory details of power and corruption. These are the people controlling the area, the media and, frankly, the U.K. Prime minister. It's about OIL. AGAIN.
394 2018-08-23 23:06:54 Pork fat, Beef fat, Goose fat, Chicken fat, and Duck fat. And plant based (fruit oils) are Olive and Avocado oils. For the only nut oil try coconut oil. All these oils are naturally occurring oils and are all saturated. Try them all. Goose fat especially. Delicious. #NSNG

397 2018-08-23 23:06:39 I noticed you bypassed the dying children in CDA to come back to the insanity of pro-bitumen talking points.  You're a genocide supporter for oil.  This gives me full license to completely discount anything you have to say.
398 2018-08-23 23:06:38 Thanks, Kenny, it will be added to the rest of my oil &/or finance references.
399 2018-08-23 23:06:18 Huh, weird. Most fish oil supplements these days pride themselves on NOT doing that anymore.
400 2018-08-23 23:05:47 Hard boiled eggs, avocado, hard salami on a salad with homemade ranch dressing (made with avocado oil)
401 2018-08-23 23:05:38 Get the black castor oil and flaxseed one. It works amazingly and doesn't flake.
402 2018-08-23 23:05:38 Reading about pyrolysis plants that take plastics, without sorting them, and ‘bake’ them to separate into usable oil, gas and carbon black. (Yes I’m a nerd) They produce their own energy, don’t burn so don’t pollute. But consumers, who use plastics, don’t want them in their hood.
403 2018-08-23 23:05:32 I just learned today that in Tex as s the State retained 1/2 ownership in minerals. So 1/2 of oil royalties go to pay Texas ed. And the oil companies still pay the 6% prod tax

Ppl in Ok have collected zip compared to Texas residents. Thanks Republicans
404 2018-08-23 23:05:28 I feel for Nigeria sha . If you use music/pop culture as ref, you can see how early 2000's post military recovery culminated in an explosion of street born creativity and optimism by mid-late 2000 then hijacked by oil boom literalist corporatists in every sphere this decade..
405 2018-08-23 23:05:07 I just made lavender lotion bars infused with rosehip oil. 

HOLY SHIT I SMELL AWESOME.
406 2018-08-23 23:04:54 We're like the drug dealer who doesn't get high...when it comes to oil. Still if we're the good guys in our story shouldn't we take a stand? Germany has... Germany!!!

409 2018-08-23 23:04:45 Another excuse to shovel public resources into the pockets of Big Oil. It's worked before.
410 2018-08-23 23:04:43 Oil companies cause atrocities globally. Get your head straight lady.
411 2018-08-23 23:04:34 The oil and coal companies should pay for a of these remediations. Auto as well. 

Capitalism kills.
412 2018-08-23 23:04:30 As far as I know for 500 years they've been a Colonial Country under rule of various other imperialist countries and you're just the next one trying to steal oil under the guise of failed nation state
413 2018-08-23 23:04:17 Israel (illegally) granted drilling rights to Syria's oil in the Golan Heights to Genie Energy. It's high profile owners include Rupert Murdoch, who keeps the stories in line with their interests, ie news blackout on the truth; Dick Cheney the former Vice President of the US, 2/
414 2018-08-23 23:04:07 So...what about Black Africans who had their land taken because of oil companies? Is he going to look into that too?  Doubt it. I thought Trump didn't want to be the world's police? Didn't he say that during his candidacy?

417 2018-08-23 23:03:39 Well in my opinion and it is only my opinion, when you find yourself in a situation (vulnerable) such as we are now then potential buyers tend to try and wait you out so they can get even a better deal but it also sends a message to potential investors (oil companies, mines) 1/
418 2018-08-23 23:03:36 I ATE ALL THE CHILI OIL! _:(´ཀ`」 ∠):_
419 2018-08-23 23:03:15 Dream on! So far you have proven yourself to be a blow hard and a fake none of the predictions you have made have come to fruition! You have been a snake oil salesman your whole life!
420 2018-08-23 23:03:11 dipikir-pikir syg jg tea tree oil udah beli mahal2 tp ga kepake, hmm
421 2018-08-23 23:02:58 Oh let’s do. Let’s see, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, and Finland all pay for it by taking money from oil companies and throwing it into the government after they seized the offshore drilling sites, which will all be gone soon and so they’ll have nothing left to pay for it.
422 2018-08-23 23:02:58 Black seed oil for the win

424 2018-08-23 23:02:51 Yeah his dad owned a lot of land and business and he was listed on a lot of properties but acted broke, always wanted to invite himself to MY apartment when he's a homeowner. 

& his dad owned a whole OIL REFINERY in the Caribbean......

I wasn't comfortable. We're still friends.
425 2018-08-23 23:02:37 First coconut oil is poison and now this. What's a man supposed to eat, grass?
426 2018-08-23 23:02:34 Income from that Oil goes to Private Companies; they are not Nationalised  ( unlike Norway's Statol ) 

If there was Tax payable; then there might be some impact ... but only on company profit (not 37bn); and UK HMRC current rules mean minimal taxable profit due 2 allowances 
427 2018-08-23 23:02:33 Subjective truthiness of a single key asserting data was always the best one was going to get. 

Anybody that claims objective truth regarding anything that isn't completely endogenous is selling snake oil.

430 2018-08-23 23:02:14 Genuinely think that the new advert from @Greenpeace about Rang-tan is the most powerful, most effective advert I've ever seen in my life. I had goosebumps down my body the whole duration of the advert and it sparked an even deeper desire in me to do what I can to avoid palm oil
431 2018-08-23 23:02:14 You don’t think Trump’s method of operation consists of lying? Really? I have a perpetual motion machine I could sell you for an exorbitant price. It runs on snake oil :)
432 2018-08-23 23:02:01 Oh well there's your reason! Motor oil is known to California to cause cancer!
433 2018-08-23 23:01:55 Haah. But ak selalunye pakai oil cleanser, so luntur sume sekali make up 
Tapi time nak reapply tu just basic je lah
434 2018-08-23 23:01:48 No, but it should be mainstream news. Israel,wants to annexe permanently the Syrian Golan Heights which it has illegally occupied for decades because there are VAST amounts of oil there, and everyone is killing each other over it. guess who Israel "granted drilling rights" to? 1/
435 2018-08-23 23:01:40 Best meal plan -if anyone doesn't know where to start: Big bowl of Green Salads with 1 piece of grass fed meat and some coconut oil or ghee.
436 2018-08-23 23:01:29 It’s so much different now with Inited have real stock. An oil owner can’t just pump in money and not churn a substantial profit. PSG and City would bleed out on the stock market I presume.

439 2018-08-23 23:01:02 As an experiment to benefit humankind, Senator Sanders should introduce a bill banning the use of heating oil in Vermont this winter.
Call it :
The Hypothermia To Prevent Hellworld Act

I'm perfectly fine with it.
440 2018-08-23 23:00:49 My truck burns hella gas when it needs an oil change...The struggle is real, rite now.
441 2018-08-23 23:00:46 That ain’t koolaid in my cup, I stay sipping that purple oil.  #sizzurp
442 2018-08-23 23:00:46 Combine 1 pound cheesecake with 4 tsps hummus. Mix in Olive Oil. Roast. Serve with a nice chianti.
443 2018-08-23 23:00:40 Remittances from USA is Mexico's Top income source, over and above their crude oil production.

ask Planned Parenthood ... 
446 2018-08-23 23:00:23 Really Joe? How about the Colorado man who strangled his pregnant wife and stuffed his CHILDREN into a oil drum. If they would never have met, SHE'D still be alive.

450 2018-08-23 23:00:09 It turns out that fish oil has the effect of reducing your risk for Alzheimer's disease.

455 2018-08-23 22:59:17 i used to put it on for 6 ish hours before showering and my hair felt so smooth.. then I had this phase where I put amla oil on my hair instead... i felt like the smell was too strong, it probably had some chemicals too. mayhaps i should start putting coconut oil in my hair again
456 2018-08-23 22:59:11 As an individual with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) it is recommended that we include Coconut oil as it contains large amounts of medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) that support the brain & nervous system. Olive oil is another healthy source of fat that is associated with cognitive health
457 2018-08-23 22:59:11 $80 for a oil change, fuck my car 
458 2018-08-23 22:58:59 The fact that you're from Richmond and became a journalist after being an executive with the Shell Oil Company is irrelevant to the discussion on whether journalism is socially exclusive, an idea you rubbish as 'class war'......go on, I'm intrigued to hear how it's irrelevant
459 2018-08-23 22:58:58 theres so much coconut oil on my fsce rn I feel like  a slug
460 2018-08-23 22:58:55 Hot bath with epsom salt and lavender oil!
461 2018-08-23 22:58:51 If you want to find oil, try in Slavonia..and drill gently, after put a bubble gum there.

464 2018-08-23 22:58:40 The hardest pill to swallow are those fish oil pills or iron ones 
465 2018-08-23 22:58:23 Dry lips? Coconut oil
Thin beard? Coconut oil
Fragile hair? Coconut oil
Money problems? Coconut oil
Broken heart? Slap a lil coconut oil onto that
On your death bed? Use coconut oil to make your skin look good during your departure
466 2018-08-23 22:58:20 Agreed. Why are food related benefits and downsides always exploited to the extreme? This time is it to make room for avacodo oil?  Bet the Harvard professor is in on it. Conspiracies 
467 2018-08-23 22:58:15 First it was coconut oil now its this: No level of alcohol is safe, 6:55 PM, We've been told a drink or two a day is fine. But a new study says no amount of liquor, wine or beer is good for your overall health
468 2018-08-23 22:58:03 Me + Physics = Oil + Water
469 2018-08-23 22:57:52 All I really need is a nap, an oil change, a few hundred thousand dollars, and a decent haircut
470 2018-08-23 22:57:44 Franks to bag a hat trick @ 201 is oil
471 2018-08-23 22:57:42 #WeGoTogetherLike oil and vinegar.
472 2018-08-23 22:57:34 Why do you think we started fracking oil in America.  when oil jumped to $145 a barrel.

But,yes.  gas prices did come down eventually.
473 2018-08-23 22:57:18 @QuikTrip QT Auto is the next phase,24 hour Oil Changes and emissions
474 2018-08-23 22:57:09 Just how much dirt and oil is in your hair? Also wouldn't shampoo which is technically a cleaning agent also repel the dirt from your skin?
475 2018-08-23 22:56:49 Is that all that's left in Iraq after we demolished it? Good thing we took the oil.
476 2018-08-23 22:56:47 No way that Sessions resigns or gets fired.
477 2018-08-23 22:56:46 Oh no , I just bought a jar of coconut oil thinking it was a healthy choice
478 2018-08-23 22:56:30 Gas prices fluctuate all the time. You can't say there is only one reason why. Availability, seasonal adjustments, refinery shutdowns, the price of crude oil are also reasons why prices change. So get a better story or you'll look a fool.

481 2018-08-23 22:55:34 And a white man shot his girlfriend in the back of the head and buried her body in a corn field, and a white man murdered his pregnant wife and two daughters and threw their bodies in an oil tank. Build a wall around white men!
482 2018-08-23 22:55:33 I’ve seen many articles today saying coconut oil is poison. If it’s cold pressed without the use of solvent of course, in your opinion is coconut oil safe to eat. If anyone could answer it would be great. Love bulletproof coffee.
483 2018-08-23 22:55:14 Hmmmm  May have to hop in her DMs I’m sure Grace needs more fruit snacks or baby oil gel while you’re out
484 2018-08-23 22:55:12 คือจะใช้ baby oil ทุกวันก็ไม่ไหวอะ 5555
485 2018-08-23 22:54:57 If you're referring to Nixon's impeachment process there I have bad news for your example. The oil crisis happened before the impeachment process. So no. Nixon's impeachment process didn't really add any more (if any) of a negative affect to the market.
486 2018-08-23 22:54:45 #WeGoTogetherLike oil and water.
487 2018-08-23 22:54:37 When are we going to benefit from that oil
488 2018-08-23 22:54:36 Doing well. And by refugees i suppose you include all those displaced from their homelands of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria due to America’s misplaced imperialism and chase for the control of oil and mineral wealth
489 2018-08-23 22:54:23 why not oil?
490 2018-08-23 22:54:22 *Pours CBD oil over life* 

That should help with everything.
491 2018-08-23 22:54:15 Always has been a snake oil salesman of the worse kind
492 2018-08-23 22:54:03 Women get a car and don’t check no oil, no tire pressure, no nothing they just wake up and drive that hoe
493 2018-08-23 22:53:50 Senator Sanders you're a millionaire I bet some of your money came from investing in Big Oil. You're just a rich fat cat who's made his money and wants everybody's to be the serfs that work under the master.
494 2018-08-23 22:53:40 I'm trying to figure out why you don't have much interest in the story about the white man who strangled his pregnant wife & put his daughters in barrels of oil.
What could be the reason................
495 2018-08-23 22:53:36 That’s what you promised was home issues but now your just in it as deep as tRump with the oil trillion airs. So sad
496 2018-08-23 22:53:25 This is a one of a kind board. Blacks, greens and whites all blended in a fun unique pattern. Walnut/Maple End grain butcher block board with handles. 16" × 25" x 2",  195 plus 20 for shipping continental US only. Finished with food safe mineral oil.
497 2018-08-23 22:53:21 Sure we can eat coal, drink oil, and breath smog. Protecting the environment should NOT be partisan.
498 2018-08-23 22:53:19 Shit was hitting the fan before the oil price dropped, even before Obama was re-elected.
499 2018-08-23 22:53:18 Horrible product!!! Your skin oil destroyed my skin and eyes!!!!
500 2018-08-23 22:53:08 @JimmieJohnson nano oil slick additives may help engine run cooler etc
501 2018-08-23 22:53:06 Get you some bio oil and put it on once a day, twice if you want. I didn’t get not 1 stretch mark and it’ll help fade the ones you have
502 2018-08-23 22:53:00 Bio Oil..look up the benefits and see if it's appropriate for what you seeking...
503 2018-08-23 22:52:47 Yes. And that is so liberating! Freely we received, freely we must give. Our oil will never run out, as long we keep pouring it out with love, in service of God's kingdom. 
504 2018-08-23 22:52:36 Try dipping a small piece of cotton with couple of drops of Clove oil n place the cotton where it oains.
Caution: excess drops of clove oil can be very unpleasant.
505 2018-08-23 22:52:35 Glue boards. Grim, but effective. And if you’re feeling you can’t face then putting an end to the wee blighters you can pour olive oil on them and they’ll unstick. But first relocate them a mile or two from the house.
506 2018-08-23 22:52:29 Concrete seawalls, barriers, gates and steel levees would actually reduce risk of pipe damage and prevent leaks.

They wouldn't just protect oil & environmental interests either.

W/ those plans, communities hit hard on the coast could have more defense.
507 2018-08-23 22:51:58 The sad thing is is that the media is passing this off as fact and you're going to have people stop using coconut oil and other coconut based products just like they did when we were warned off butter, meat and dairy 40 years ago.
508 2018-08-23 22:51:53 Who moving to Texas to mine Oil 
509 2018-08-23 22:51:45 Or olive oil, since they’ve now re-declared coconut oil to be “poison.”
510 2018-08-23 22:51:38 Well I can tell you there are for sure foreign exchange students that love coconut oil.
511 2018-08-23 22:51:28 If she didn't knock before coming in y'all will complain, now that she's knocking you guys are still complaining

514 2018-08-23 22:51:07 Motor oil works wonders.
515 2018-08-23 22:50:58 I needed an oil change about 3 weeks ago. 
516 2018-08-23 22:50:43 Drinking hot oil like a dualist or whtever , but my body is a false cognate imo.
517 2018-08-23 22:50:42 I know the owners of a company in Tehachapi California that maintains most of the local solar arrays - they pay minimum wage to their workers to weed and clean the arrays.  Not skilled labor.  Oil and gas employs over a million so the article only tells a small part of the story
518 2018-08-23 22:50:02 Well if you seen or heard of the lorry drivers strike a few years back supermarket shelves empty within 2 or 3 days you couldn't  buy a Tin of beans. Then you have the oil crisis the UK went on a 3  day working week power cuts daliy no fuel.
It only takes a hiccup to stop the UK
519 2018-08-23 22:49:59 Hello ma'am. Yes, you can. Do you want the oil or butter, please?
520 2018-08-23 22:49:55 Nope I live right in the midst of all three.  The solar arrays are equally an eye sore and take up more space than an oil well to produce the same amount of energy.  Wind pollutes equally as bad.  Look beneath any turbine and you will find acres of lube oil contamination.
521 2018-08-23 22:49:55 remain poster boy Starmer is flogging that snake oil again.

523 2018-08-23 22:49:49 @BlakeNorthcott Going to the way back machine, have you ever seen “Duel” from 1971?   Directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Dennis Weaver.   Great thriller between a car and oil tanker.
524 2018-08-23 22:49:45 "Many celebs use deodorant on the red carpet for their face. lt absorbs the oil and stops the shine!"

526 2018-08-23 22:49:28 Bf discourse? Can’t see it through the almond oil on my lashes, it’s kinda blurry.
527 2018-08-23 22:49:23 Buddy brought this strain of dab oil to my place the other day called dirty girl and i was checkin out the package that read "hybrid dirty girl" and said "you could call me that too" and he said "i was thinking of calling you that but wasn't sure if it would be a horrible insult"

 They would be DEMANDING lengthy prison  sentences,if not capital punishment.
530 2018-08-23 22:49:06 North Dakota Oil Production Slips but Set for More Records
531 2018-08-23 22:48:58 Hey @GraigKreindler , what surface do you paint the most on? All oil? Thanks!
532 2018-08-23 22:48:46 The currency oil is sold in is important but what's more important is the currency in which nations save. Oil can be sold in € but thenEuros are exchanged for US dollars. That was Saddam's mistake. If he only saved in US dollars as Saudi Arabia he'd still be here.
533 2018-08-23 22:48:41 I'm not going to bother reading articles about "what the studies actually say about coconut oil." I can tell it's poison by the awful taste.
534 2018-08-23 22:48:38 Followed thank you for sharing.
535 2018-08-23 22:48:27 Leaving my drug dealers house and some 40 year old dude at the table goes “party on” Bitch I am buying an oil cartridge

537 2018-08-23 22:48:20 With rules and processes set by Westminster. Scottish Government have little say in the policy decision making how our country is run. E.g. Oil revenues is Billions higher in most other countries than Scotland due to UK Policy.
538 2018-08-23 22:48:09 Olive oil lobby at work
539 2018-08-23 22:48:05 Noticed the tires under the oil tanker ... ouch !
540 2018-08-23 22:47:49 Done!
541 2018-08-23 22:47:36 Oil companies don't rip babies arms out of their sockets. Planned parenthood has been known to do that.  Oh, and then sell their organs.  
542 2018-08-23 22:47:32 Its going downhill fast when most of our world leaders are oil shills.
543 2018-08-23 22:47:20 Great news! But Permian Basin 2018 strong recovery has been forecast since 2016 due to global economic factors mostly unrelated to politics or the government.  Crooked Hillary supported fracking; Criminal Donald supports oil exports, but added crazy trade policy
544 2018-08-23 22:47:19 The thing sef tire me... detoxing Africans from Middle Eastern myths and fables would take some time bro.
545 2018-08-23 22:47:12 If we lose our oil and auto industry, agriculture after losing steel and manufacturing what will we administer?
546 2018-08-23 22:46:49 I’m browsing a restaurant supply website because I wanted not actually butter popcorn oil and now I want everything.
547 2018-08-23 22:46:25 Next time plan ahead and drop it around to my place on the weekend.
Not only am I sufficiently Alpha to gaze longingly (and quite unknowingly) at a car's engine block, I can also get underneath one and change the oil and filter.

Almost useful.
548 2018-08-23 22:46:07 Keep the fucking Oil money away from the club
549 2018-08-23 22:46:07 If you wash the body first then hair dirt/oil gets washed past the clean body when you rinse the hair. Wash the hair first, then condition and leave conditioner in while you wash the body. Then rinse all.
550 2018-08-23 22:46:03 The only thing 'Sinister' in this scenario is the crown prosecutor - one can't help but wonder and if he has investments in the tar sands and oil industry. This sounds very corrupt! @JustinTrudeau @jjorgan @AJWVictoriaBC

557 2018-08-23 22:45:33 It's a good thing I don't think coconut oil is a bad thing then. 

Some people in the medical/dietetic/ nutritional field don't like the fact that extra virgin coconut oil, olive oil and grass-fed butter/ghee is good for health. 

They don't like lo carb either.

563 2018-08-23 22:44:47 Are those predudiced by color who are outraged about the illegal alien who murdered the Iowa girl equally outraged about the white dad who killed & stuffed his babies in an oil tank and murdered his pregnant wife?  Is the outrage the same?

567 2018-08-23 22:43:54 For a nice change of pace this is not about oil. Niger supplies most of the uranium that powers France.
568 2018-08-23 22:43:53 We can get oil elsewhere, plenty of other sources!

570 2018-08-23 22:43:33 During the cooler weather, I drink warm lemon water every a.m. with turmeric, ginger, pepper & olive oil and half hour later eat.  With the hotter weather have been doing fresh organic squeezed lemons & water with just ginger.

572 2018-08-23 22:43:22 Don't forget Labour changed those geographical locations one month before opening of Scottish Parliament in 99 to move fishing AND oil wells into English waters for revenue
573 2018-08-23 22:43:21 and improve lives, not take them. Land means nothing, money means nothing and oil certainly means nothing. Israeli's are going no where, Palistininans are going no where. Why not work together to build something actually good and make a change in the world.
574 2018-08-23 22:43:21 Typical rich frat boy make all your money off of others work and yet get mad you have to pay taxes. You don't drill it, you don't transport it, you don't refine it. You don't do any of the actual labor involved in the oil fields, you just make deals.
575 2018-08-23 22:43:04 Mines a 03 and anytime I need an oil change I’ll get that check engine light or since I have an after market gas cap if I don’t have a full tank or don’t put the cap on just right I’ll get the light. It’s fucking annoying dude
576 2018-08-23 22:43:01 What in the world does oil companies have to do with murdering innocent children?
577 2018-08-23 22:42:54 does dan know oil blotting sheets exist ?? someone gift him with some it might blow his mind
578 2018-08-23 22:42:47 Same i just trim an oil it way more
579 2018-08-23 22:42:45 How else would you fite to the death while nude and covered in coconut oil @bronzeagemantis ?
580 2018-08-23 22:42:39 Soap and water... it’s just flour and oil. 
581 2018-08-23 22:42:33 I’ve used coconut oil for 3 yrs now and my bloods are the best they’ve been. My weight is exactly where it should be too.  Micheal Mosley showed that coconut oil is actually beneficial when he and his team put it to the test on the BBC program Trust Me, I’m a Doctor.
582 2018-08-23 22:42:32 I can probably definitely YouTube how to change my oil right?
583 2018-08-23 22:42:20 We poppin like oil ollies and fire flames
Im harder than DJ Khaled playing the fucking quiet game
584 2018-08-23 22:42:13 Some Man City fans keep it real, but most have become utterly dazzled by the shiny baubles & cannot see the game is dying in front of their eyes. 

But when the oil money begins to swirl all around them in the PL they will soon wake the fuck up & join the rest of us in hating it.
585 2018-08-23 22:41:52 Our magic car is new and technologically sophisticated enough that not only can I get shamed by the people changing oil, I can be nagged by the vehicle itself.

I'd change the oil myself, but I'm not sure I could turn off the nagging module.
586 2018-08-23 22:41:52 The end of the world is China sending nuclear to USA www3 for oil man
587 2018-08-23 22:41:48 I change my own oil but it's really my dad that has to remind me to change my oil. I feel like I'm guilted into it.  

But +20 lesbian points for doing it myself.

Im in love with my own Painting  with this Oil on board needs a fabulous frame now
589 2018-08-23 22:41:38 Like I said.  Snake oil.
590 2018-08-23 22:41:36 My bet is the meeting was to discuss a US military base in Guyana for guarding the Oil company while using Venezuela as an excuse for the base.
591 2018-08-23 22:41:33 We have resorted to rationing our remaining snuff tin, and the whale oil runs low in the lamps. Please send word of the crops.
592 2018-08-23 22:41:32 yesenia is clutch for bringing her oil pen to work 
593 2018-08-23 22:41:21 Terrible way to day. How many tweets should we expect from you on the strangulation and murder by the man of his wife and two children, the latters bodies being dump into a vat of oil?
594 2018-08-23 22:41:16 Never about US interest in Iraqi oil. Religious conflict is the reality over there. We broke it by taking out the power structure.
595 2018-08-23 22:41:13 I don't hate women. I hate the fact most wanna pick and choose what they will and won't do. Oh, so you can do anything that I can? Change oil? Oh, right, beneath your station huh? Fairness as long as princess doesn't break nail? I have little respect for you
596 2018-08-23 22:41:11 My mom literally uses coconut oil for EVERYTHING. From her cooking spray to putting it on Coco’s booty when it’s rashy and red.
597 2018-08-23 22:41:08 against each other. I want peace in the middle east more than anyone, I'm sick of politicians exploiting it. I'm sick of everyone in the middle east being blown up because of what they do and don't believe in. Why? what is the point? money? land? oil? water? why not work together

599 2018-08-23 22:40:52 Have you read the description of corporatism by John Ralston @JohnRalstonSaul in Unconscious Civilization?  Group negotiations with governments a managers is how public policy is determined now. e.g. key policy wonk ENGOs & Big Oil negotiated some key terms of NDP climate plan...
600 2018-08-23 22:40:48 I took the remedial lesbianing course; I can change a tire, but not oil.
601 2018-08-23 22:40:41 ANDREW: *getting Dunkin Donuts*

MADDY: What are you gonna get?

ANDREW: An oil change, what tf do you think?

MADDY:

ANDREW: grandma shark do do do do do do
602 2018-08-23 22:40:34 Ha typical answer from a lib. Putin must have scared Germany bc they're paying Russia a shit ton of $ for oil & natural gas- which makes zero sense. Why do you care about the European Union?
603 2018-08-23 22:40:32 Because BILLIONS IN BIG DIRTY RUSSIAN OIL MONEY.
604 2018-08-23 22:40:28 i have coconut oil for sure since the vegan cookies i bake my bf uses it LMAO. that being said i bought a couple conditioners so i should be ok! she was just saying my sis hated it when she did it but... clearly loads of people love it, so. i'm giving it a go!
605 2018-08-23 22:40:28 美少年は今日も可愛いなー！

612 2018-08-23 22:39:33 So this Halloween when I down a bag of fun size Milky Ways I will think and say..... It’s  better than coconut oil.  Yikes!
613 2018-08-23 22:39:23 Done 

614 2018-08-23 22:39:01 @LAYS thanks for making Herb & Olive Oil Less Salt with addictive flavor & no MSG, no autolyzed yeast. #CantEatJustOne
615 2018-08-23 22:38:55 Dont worry in few yrs they will say coconut oil is the best oil. They do it to destroy others practice and selll their own products a
616 2018-08-23 22:38:43 We have a wonderful system that is taking place here in Vermont since the legalization of marijuana. Sale is not currently legal, which means also not regulated. So what happens now is someone gifts me a vile of oil, and I gift them $20. (not for the oil, out of appreciation)
617 2018-08-23 22:38:42 Fsg has stated they’d look for a minority shareholder from what I read. Surely some oil money for transfers wouldn’t be the worst thing. FSG won’t sell club unless there’s a ridiculous offer.
618 2018-08-23 22:38:38 Same except eucalyptus oil and wet towels from my gym
619 2018-08-23 22:38:35 Look. I CAN* change my own oil. But I prefer to pay someone else. 

*I was literally taught by a lesbian in Pasadena during my first ever visit to LA when I was still in college 
620 2018-08-23 22:38:19 Your hair will be ok! The hairstylist will know what they're doing when they bleach it. And if it feels dry, there are some moisturizing hair products out there that can help, or you could use coconut oil if you already have it on hand.

You're gonna look awesome!
621 2018-08-23 22:38:18 How long between oil changes are we talking here?
622 2018-08-23 22:38:03 I knew many years ago that when Venezuela ( as did Iraq ) try to sell oil barrels In their own currency, instead of the accepted worldwide US dollar they were f''''d. If either had a capitalist Govt , they would have been on a level with Qatar and Oman. But no, big govt.
623 2018-08-23 22:37:55 Wait is it coconut or banana oil? Please help
624 2018-08-23 22:37:27 anyone who gets their oil changed on time is a cop
625 2018-08-23 22:37:19 Supply risks? Your narratives dont match.  Low growth means less consumption. US is pumping record amounts and the OPEC deal is being relaxed.  Doesnt seem like you know oil very well.
626 2018-08-23 22:37:15 Precious treasure and oil are in the dwelling of a wise person, but a fool consumes them. - Proverbs 21:20

627 2018-08-23 22:37:10 if coconut oil was poison then I would be dead for some years
628 2018-08-23 22:36:47 But I'm nitpicking here - just in case people want more info, over all I'd agree with the general message. 
TL;DR coconut oil probably isn't poison and people are silly
629 2018-08-23 22:36:44 Some on here wont care about the consequences of that mate, just want the oil money, would much rather do it the sustainable way as we are 
630 2018-08-23 22:36:42 I assume 2 drops of tea tree essential oil and 20 drops of witch hazel
631 2018-08-23 22:36:41 Pan?
632 2018-08-23 22:36:25 I love when I come to get my oil changed and I’m by myself and they try and tell me that I basically need to replace every part that exists on my car :-) time to call dad
633 2018-08-23 22:36:25 One word, Plastics! Just kidding, Oil!
634 2018-08-23 22:36:14 Well, it amazing to me that still big oil will not pay a dime of the Houston-Harvey bill. Why, oh why not? That oil spilled all over poor neighborhoods.
635 2018-08-23 22:35:59 My coat has gotten flaky again. My Vet Dr said I was swimming so much it was washing all the oil out of my coat.  Prescription- MORE FISH OIL. I’m not giving up swimming till the snow flies lol
636 2018-08-23 22:35:54 And oil on the metal to slide it through

639 2018-08-23 22:35:30 its all just whipped soybean oil anyway.
640 2018-08-23 22:35:27 It was a keyway operation to be used to take out Iran and Lebanon.
They were after gas-not oil.
It's no accident that both FalseFlagWars under Obama-Ukraine&Syria-are next to Russi&Iran-world's 1&2 gas reserves-or that Russian Gasprom pipes 40% of Europe's gas through Ukraine.
641 2018-08-23 22:35:20 I just told the oil change man to "do your best" because he asked me so many questions I didn't know the answer to.
642 2018-08-23 22:35:12 Put oil in my car, that’s my adult move for the day

644 2018-08-23 22:35:03 Man has more oil in his hair than Roman does at Sibneft
645 2018-08-23 22:35:00 why does looking at animals covered in oil make me sad, but looking at animals covered in oil and deep-fried make me hungry?
646 2018-08-23 22:34:57 Tea tree oil will help clear that up in a few days! Every night before you go to bed.
647 2018-08-23 22:34:55 Oil money incoming if we sell 13%  to arab investors
648 2018-08-23 22:34:34 My new essential oil diffuser came in finally heheheh
649 2018-08-23 22:34:30 Tossed some mustard seed, onion, ginger, and jalapeño on some hot oil. The smell immediately shocked my me into a hyper vivid memory of being in Atul Goel’s kitchen in 2nd grade. Feel like I just took some DMT.
650 2018-08-23 22:34:24 I see stats and trends, I get it. There is not one single person who can say that they don’t  know people who were jobless over the last 2-4 years that are now employed. I can only worry about a circle so big but things are absolutely better in my field of oil and gas
651 2018-08-23 22:34:18 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails

658 2018-08-23 22:33:36 Colorado being robbed by Oil & Gas Industry. Severance tax in Wyoming on extraction 11%. In Colorado it's1.5%. Oil & Gas Industry is irresponsible & dangerous.

659 2018-08-23 22:33:33 His face looks like he's trying to smile after he swallowed a gallon of castor oil after biting into a piece of lemon. But I really think it's because he's trying to hide how much longer he needs to kiss trump's ass before he gets the boot.
660 2018-08-23 22:33:22 I care about all lives so I think all men should be regulated, undocumented people & citizens alike since based on data a large majority of murderers are male American citizens. Don’t you care about the little girls that were strangled by their daddy & dumped in crude oil?
661 2018-08-23 22:33:18 The bull market started in March,  2009. Trump took office in 2017, nearly 8 years later. He's presided over 15% of the market's run.

The economy was soaring when he took office.

Raping the landscape for oil, coal and corporate America is the opposite of an accomplishment.
662 2018-08-23 22:33:08 Heh, come over here, kid, learn something. You never know, you might have to cook for twenty guys someday. You see, you start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it; ya make sure it doesn't stick.

678 2018-08-23 22:30:51 Lol this just in. Oil is rich in fat!
679 2018-08-23 22:30:49 yeah I put them together with the clary sage essential oil (for a nice scent) and work it thru my hair. any remainder just goes on the rest of my head frankly. they're great carrier oils to use with ess. oil too.
680 2018-08-23 22:30:30 Coconut oil obviously isn't literal poison, just like MacDonalds and Coca Cola obviously aren't literal poison. Does it mean they're  good for you? Nah dawg.. But you ingest it all the time & you're alive and healthy tho? S'cool, s'cool...

692 2018-08-23 22:29:30 Correction- insane Union? Scotland exports food, energy, oil and gas, and yet the insane among us howl "deficit", they are the "pawns in their game", to quote some American singer.
693 2018-08-23 22:29:28 UAE can donate via offering to FORGIVE OIL PAYMENT. WHY so much DRAMA :-)))

1) UAE offer isn't confirmed.
2) if so, bias of foreign countries towards one particular state cannot be permitted for various reasons.
3) if they're so concerned welfare, why NEVER deported DAWOOD ? :-)

The Native communities came to her rescue when she got crosswise with the GOP party.

So does she return that loyalty? Nope. She tightened her allegiance to the GOP and oil money instead.
Sickening.

699 2018-08-23 22:28:25 definitely.Failures of our Politicians to properly distribute and manage the resources effectively does not suggest how rich this continent is. DRC is richer than the USA.

705 2018-08-23 22:27:54 Democratic Socialism in America is not the same as in Venezuela. Venezuela is failing because they based their entire economy on their oil exports.

709 2018-08-23 22:27:37 Yo si creo que el Oil&Gas es un oligopolio natural, como la transmisión de energía por el CAPEX necesario, pero es que en el pais esto es un monopolio, todos los pozos, oleoductos, refinerías, son de Ecopetrol.
710 2018-08-23 22:27:33 I just noticed the coconut oil is ever so slightly more viscous and less clear, which can only mean one thing: CARDIGAN TIMES ARE APPROACHING. 
711 2018-08-23 22:27:19 So "highly refined" peanut oil is considered not an allergin... that's fascinating... does that mean I can potentially eat food cooked in it?
712 2018-08-23 22:27:15 Just stick those grease and oil covered work gloves right in there.
713 2018-08-23 22:26:52 The New York Yankees are Freemason clones conducting a hyper-sigil! Punk rock was invented by an ad agency to sell spikey pins! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
714 2018-08-23 22:26:51 people who put coconut oil on their face have a death wish
715 2018-08-23 22:26:50 Her: CoQ10 is a real thing
Me: hey, so is coconut oil, so is everything, everything I take is a real thing 
Her: yeah right

These are the kind of arguments my mother and I have.
716 2018-08-23 22:26:49 Patriots are voting in the Midterms in record numbers no matter what is happening.  Democrats must be blocked from power from here to eternity!  NOBODY sits out because they're angry or any other reason!
717 2018-08-23 22:26:21 I am pretty sure the EU has tariffs on the oil from saudi arabia but i am willing to say that me and you would love to see Saudi gone (the Saudi in Saudi Arabia is the ruling family)  because i doubt me and you like the king
718 2018-08-23 22:26:13 me c 2006: I don’t understand why they don’t just use grapefruit oil for lip plumping 
My sister: why would they use grapefruit oil 
Me: bc grapefruit makes your mouth swell up?

and that’s how I found out I’m allergic to grapefruit
719 2018-08-23 22:26:07 Count in Indian western region which feast on coconut oil
720 2018-08-23 22:25:55 #WeGoTogetherLike oil and water!
721 2018-08-23 22:25:44 No, you're not, actually. It takes 2 seconds to look up why. Every other day is fine, but doing it too often washes off a layer of oil the body creates to protect itself from microorganisms, as well as keeping the skin from drying out.
722 2018-08-23 22:25:29 No doubt FSG out will be trending again soon after what I just read. Fuck off with your oil money we don't need you or it.
723 2018-08-23 22:25:26 “Yeah. Everyone got one and was taught how to make the oil. Unlike most birds that produce oil or a power for their feathers, Phoenixes don’t.” She gets more oil, starting on the other wing. She was quick.
724 2018-08-23 22:25:13 Oil was a great buy on the trades for a whole 3 weeks last month.. Is Australia in abit if trouble ?

726 2018-08-23 22:24:58 @AllisonKropff @CBSCourtney I can say Aspartame is more poison  than coconut oil is
727 2018-08-23 22:24:57 Green pear ginger oil sugar maple that’s interesting #ShawnSignatureII
728 2018-08-23 22:24:52 argan oil? im not sure :(
729 2018-08-23 22:24:50 Watch it, Harvard professor made news this week that coconut oil is pure poison.
730 2018-08-23 22:24:47 #byrd4wyo Plan to re-purpose all of our energy portfolio (coal, LNG, oil)  to non-GHG markets.
731 2018-08-23 22:24:43 @hcg2_0 not sure where else to go with this question but can I roast my veggies with a little of the mct oil? Is that ok will it work?  Starting soon.
732 2018-08-23 22:24:39 The one I’m thinking of is now a snake oil salesman.
733 2018-08-23 22:24:29 Well, as long as oil exists might as well suck it dry. It brings a lot of money anyways.
734 2018-08-23 22:24:28 The only thing Gaddafi did was change his currency to gold standard instead of being backed by US dollars the Rothchild's & Vanderbilt's would lose millions from not get their Federal Reserve kickbacks. It was all about greed or do believe Iraq was about freedom and not oil
735 2018-08-23 22:24:26 You don’t want Oil Money
736 2018-08-23 22:24:15 if i can put coconut oil on it, i will
737 2018-08-23 22:24:13 Get a burner twitter account and continue poking Oil fans and soccer folks
738 2018-08-23 22:24:03 It won't matter to me what happens to them I will got vote early and often!
739 2018-08-23 22:24:02 Voting either way RED!!!!!
740 2018-08-23 22:23:55 Our problem has always been Lawwell. EVERY season he & the shareholders treat celtic like an oil company to make millions from. Playing budget gets washers. Eliminate the problem, Lawwell. Empty stadium until hes OUT. Hes the  problem and we do nothing about it..
741 2018-08-23 22:23:30 The problem is Barnum’s law, which states: there’s a sucker born every minute.
A con man always sounds better to the gullible, because they’ll promise anything to get elected.
So how do we educate people to the point they stop buying snake oil politics?
742 2018-08-23 22:23:21 Will you be eligible for work release in the oil field? Perhaps you should look into that? The mouthpiece has more to say, and he will
743 2018-08-23 22:23:12 Makes sense. No idea about coconut oil. But, there’s little correlation between dietary consumption of Cholesterol and blood cholesterol, how do I know? Went on a Keto diet, consuming 2-6 eggs EVERYDAY for 6 mos. What happened? Lost 50 pounds, Cholesterol down, HDL up, LDL down!
744 2018-08-23 22:23:04 Gotta say, we weren't digging for oil and if you agree that the longest war in this country's history is a "semi war" too, your fuckin wrong
745 2018-08-23 22:23:03 Tea tree oil gives me the biggest headache aaaaaaahhhh
746 2018-08-23 22:23:00 Let me see if I got this straight. The Big Oil Companies are the number one contributor to climate change and rising coastal waters. Now they have the unmitigated gaul to ask the feds for $12 billion for their refineries. 

My response would be:  "Go Fuck Yourselves"
747 2018-08-23 22:22:54 Oil producers have been able to do this in New York for 40 years.
748 2018-08-23 22:22:34 But people aren’t consuming an entire bottle of CBD oil, avg suggested dose is 10-20mg of oil daily.  So not a fair comparison.
749 2018-08-23 22:22:30 The southern oil rich city of Basra, Iraq is facing a health epidemic, large number of people have been effected by unsanitary water.

750 2018-08-23 22:22:28 Lundi! 
Imagine pouring fish oil on someone's else's son's dick . Scorching hot oil, yeses.
751 2018-08-23 22:22:27 I'm public, and I thoroughly enjoy watching you truth thrash that snake oil salesman on the regular.
752 2018-08-23 22:22:27 He literally opened the oil cap last time we were working on my car a couple weeks ago and he's like, "looks kinda black..." oh my GOD it's a month or two over, I'll risk living on the edge. Really, I'll be fine. 
753 2018-08-23 22:22:23 When nutrition, health, working out is your passion, you listen to the experts & figure out "truth". When you are a "normal" person you listen to health advice from the news where they taut the crazy stupid studies like the recent 1 about coconul oil being worse than canola oil
754 2018-08-23 22:22:14 Well yeah, USA is USA. Saudis use oil too, it's sold for cheaper than Europe or America though.
755 2018-08-23 22:22:06 I got a vape pen and a bunch of high grade oil cartridges coming my way real soon and I’m so excited!!!
756 2018-08-23 22:21:51 Sooo me and hot oil dont get on 2nd time I've managed to burn myself but at least this time i didnt end up in a&e
757 2018-08-23 22:21:50 These people have entirely too much time on their hands. I can think of SO many better things to do. Maintenance, oil baths, repair cycles, and even dipping myself in lava, like my more famous brother.
Seriously, don't they have anything at all they could be doing?

761 2018-08-23 22:21:35 Fuck the oil money, I have no interest whatsoever in signing little shits like neymar for €200m and funding his all year round Carnival. Let's stick to slumming it with our world record fee GK and world record fee defender, world class manager, record breaking attack etc
762 2018-08-23 22:21:29 Charlene also does essential oil and ADP payroll software sales and make up and also shes sales exec i think she wants to sell oil and payroll services and makeup and perfume shes combo like finl plnng and insurance and tax service but cosmatology side kinda
763 2018-08-23 22:21:25 You’re more slippery than an eel covered in oil. You have a real problem with people questioning things, don’t you? Seems you want everyone to think just like you.
764 2018-08-23 22:21:19 Living in the last days (The Book Of Revelations), deadly storms, floods, hurricanes & people killing each other including family members killing thier mates & children burying them in oil buildings etc is from not following God's Laws & Commandments, Your mind is in Evilness!

767 2018-08-23 22:21:15 I’ve read that there’s little to no benefit of leaving d/c in longer than an hour but idk how that applies to oil treatments
768 2018-08-23 22:21:13 During this rotation 2 litres of engine oil were burn. 
769 2018-08-23 22:21:03 Millions of Nigerians lost their jobs in the Banking, Oil and Private sectors, but since you are a BMC bot, you will not see the Truth and say it. 

And since you are currently happy about the Job Losses, may the Hunger/Pain the Victims are suffering be your portion. Say Amen.

778 2018-08-23 22:20:18 MrFakeNews,what's oil prices connect with UAE Keralafund offer. 
If Gujarat had same flood disaster,Gujjubania 56"Chhati's cronies would have gone on overdrive and  kissed UAE's ass to collect donation. 
Nobody's fooled,BJP hypocrites playing politics!!!

815 2018-08-23 22:17:06 From 2005 to 2015, the United States’ reliance on petroleum imports fell from 60% to 25% of total consumption. The economy, oil production well everything turned around before Trump. You just don't get it. TRUMP has done nothing.

820 2018-08-23 22:16:19 Will it keep out daddies who strangle their little girls & dump them in a barrel of crude oil or boyfriends who shoot their girlfriend in the back of the head in a deserted field?
821 2018-08-23 22:16:16 Just dumped my leftover beard oil in my wife's essential oil diffuser & pretty sure I just broke it.
It couldn't handle the manliness.
822 2018-08-23 22:16:06 Lol this proves your ignorance. Saudi provides oil, huge amounts of it. With that money, they benefit other countries. They pay ridiculous tuitions for it's citizens and especially in Canada there are a lot of connections in the medical field. Lots of fellowships for example.
823 2018-08-23 22:15:54 Someone tell pence there is oil on his anus.
824 2018-08-23 22:15:42 I need to put this hot oil treatment in my head but I’m being lazy 
825 2018-08-23 22:15:33 What makes you think a balanced ass Libra and a bi polar ass unstable Gemini would be a good match. That is oil and water my friend
826 2018-08-23 22:15:33 Beth thing ever. I have awful dry and sensitive skin so the coconut oil and sugar is awesome. Exfoliate and hydrate 
827 2018-08-23 22:15:33 The carbon steel the oil rigs are made from is a much sought after materiel. I believe the oil companiues are liable for scrapping them?  Have you ever heard of Statoil?
828 2018-08-23 22:15:30 I’ve been doing lash extensions for months now & everytime I take them off (with oil) mine have grown longer & fuller. So I think it really all depends how you take care of them.

832 2018-08-23 22:14:43 If we want to imagine what would happen to SA if the EFF wins the general election one only has to see what's become of 'oil rich' Venezuela. A country destroyed in a frighteningly short time. Residents fleeing. Starvation & terror. Worthless bank accounts. Shameful.
833 2018-08-23 22:14:35 I used to be like that, however, since my health scare 4 years ago with a pending STROKE, I was advised to go on full Cold Press coconut oil. I started eating avocado, butter, free range eggs.. well everything that we were told not to consume..
834 2018-08-23 22:14:28 You mean that Big Oil wants more billions in infrastructure protection from climate change besides the $26 billion or so per year they get in fossil foolish subsidies?

838 2018-08-23 22:13:43 @RehamKhan1 if you go a little lower you might become a billionaire cause you will find oil. May Allah protect men from Woman like you.  It’s sick that you are ready to comment anything to become a news item and for cheap publicity. What are you without @ImranKhanPTI.
839 2018-08-23 22:13:38 On days I'm feeling down, I like to prep myself up from past experiences. Like the time my car was leaking gas, oil, coolant, and power steering fluid all while my bumper was dragging. I had $17 to my name and I went to the casino and left with $1,200. But I don't have 17 bucks:/
840 2018-08-23 22:13:34 Oh and 150000 oil jobs gone
841 2018-08-23 22:13:16 Because that’s sensible, responsible, & mature ... & requires self-control. Whereas, this snake oil salesman assured me that I can be as irresponsible & self-indulgent as I like if I only drink coconut water/açaí juice/pomegranate juice/cucumber water/insert new fad here. 
842 2018-08-23 22:13:16 Right on. But I've advocated a doubleheader on last weekend of camp: Oilers vs. AHL and ECHL vs. Oil Kings-Bears. Worked for years in Windsor and other cities. Last chance for fringe guys to make an impression.
843 2018-08-23 22:13:14 Oil
844 2018-08-23 22:13:06 It's almost as if the oil and gas industry is dishonest or something.
845 2018-08-23 22:13:04 That's what Obama finally did. Sent in a hit squad and killed the prick. We could've done that in 2002 without whacking 2 countries in the process. Okay, Afghan deserved it - even I tried to re-up, but Iraq? Seriously? There was no oil in Afghan, soo… Wait, poppys! You tell me.
846 2018-08-23 22:13:01 Women get a car & don’t check the oil, tire pressure, coolant, no nothing. They just wake up & drive that mf .
847 2018-08-23 22:12:59 (you guys know mayonnaise is just egg, oil and a little lemon and vinegar right? it is not, like, fashioned of poo.)
848 2018-08-23 22:12:44 MMMMMmmmmmm.. There,s a schedule D notice in place on the reserves in the Claire ridge oil field, Either Westminster can continue spunking the dough on bankers or we can grab it... If you are worried about your pension why no mention of Brexit or the falling pound?
849 2018-08-23 22:12:41 Like oil and water #WeGoTogetherLike
850 2018-08-23 22:12:39 I see clearly the lying snake oil salesman that has stained our free country. His only motivation is greed and power. Why didn't he release his taxes? Because he's a crook. Why did he lie about paying off pornstars? Because he's sleazy. Why does he bully? Because he's a coward.
851 2018-08-23 22:12:31 I’ll do the oil change for you for half that price 
852 2018-08-23 22:12:11 Hash oil
853 2018-08-23 22:12:11 Got free oil from a client in #Charlestown.The boiler stopped working. Husband asked if it smelled like oil. no, I dont smell it at all. Is that bad? He said yea. I asked what it could be. His answer "a body".... #mafiablood #thetown
854 2018-08-23 22:11:50 Income from unknown origin ( oil ) will have an effect on any deficit if it was coming direct to Scotland .
855 2018-08-23 22:11:28 Hmm... am I wrong to think we were oil exporters during WW2?
856 2018-08-23 22:11:21 #WeGoTogetherLike oil and water
857 2018-08-23 22:11:14 WINKLER COUNTY DETOUR: 3-vehicle crash on SH 302 about 2 miles west of Kermit. Westbound traffic being diverted to SH115; eastbound traffic being sent to CR 207. Large amount of oil and diesel scattered across both lanes. Hazmat has been notified by DPS.
858 2018-08-23 22:10:57 There is no fear of oil in the presence of God and then the Saud
859 2018-08-23 22:10:56 So right, I run into so many people that say to me, your in oil and gas well you are ruining the world. I smile and go on

861 2018-08-23 22:10:36 Don’t forget that @realDonaldTrump is noticeably silent about Chris Watts murdering his pregnant wife and two young daughters who he submerged in oil filled drums but he has plenty of time to bring up the murder of Mollie Tibbetts because one murder was

864 2018-08-23 22:09:46 can I oil you up
865 2018-08-23 22:09:37 Because they have trillions of dollars and have OIL
866 2018-08-23 22:09:31 Stop please, we know what happened in our country very well, we know who let Islamic from prisons, we know who opened our border, we know who signed the oil and national gas contracts and most importantly we know who is our enemy. Sorry, I can't lie to my self.
867 2018-08-23 22:09:23 Oil companies and agricultural companies will be the death of this beautiful planet. It's a shame that the human animal is capable of such attrocties. The Earth will go on, even if we don't.
868 2018-08-23 22:09:13 Best of luck to ya. Walking is the best and drinking lots of water. I make a lot of stem veggies and grilled chicken. Pasta and little olive oil is good too
869 2018-08-23 22:09:01 She looks totally dangerous to the Canadian oil industry and should probably be held in solitary confinement. What is this country coming to where pensioners and grandparents are jailed as they stand up for the survival of the next generations?
870 2018-08-23 22:08:57 Ooh I hate paying for oil changes
871 2018-08-23 22:08:56 Am inviting you to Nigeria so you come see the nature and beauty of Obudu Catu ranche of Calabar, Badagry history of Lagos, Aso rock of Abuja, the first oil well in old Rivers state Olouberi and many other beautiful tourist site within the 36 states of the nation @UIrichJvV
872 2018-08-23 22:08:55 The oil wells add methane to the atmosphere causing the planet to heat up which results in large massive hurricanes & huge floods, loss of life & property damage!
873 2018-08-23 22:08:53 Not only that they are amongst the worst made vehicles in the world with a very low rating with customers. BWtroubleyous you cant even check the oil level! Electric & Hybrids are a con. Plus they are being designed to allow cabal controlled govs to switch them off or crash you!
874 2018-08-23 22:08:42 Throw my Senator James Inhoff in the mix too! He represents no one but the Oil and Gas ultra rich! I guarantee that is not the majority of the citizens in Oklahoma! We are getting Bluer all the time!#TermLimits #Resistance #FBR
875 2018-08-23 22:08:40 The tease fragrance oil from @TheVSAngels is BOMB ASF!
876 2018-08-23 22:08:27 I hate being here, even for an oil change. Car dealerships literally have the worst environments- except for those 5 minutes from when you decide to buy the car to when they bring you the invoice. – bij Russell & Smith Honda
877 2018-08-23 22:08:24 This is Complete Bullshit!!
This is NOT science, it’s #ClimateChange dogma hysteria from vultures who’ve already hoodwinked their peons.

#Oil = cause w/Near 100% CERTAINTY...Really??

880 2018-08-23 22:08:08 Still kinda mad (on behalf of others' principles, to be clear, I am not vegetarian) that 25 years ago McD advertised its fries widely as "fried in vegetable oil", which was true in the store, but before that in the factory they'd been fried in beef fat, frozen, and shipped out.
881 2018-08-23 22:08:07 Lol since when? In my company, some people worked on sallah day ma
882 2018-08-23 22:07:52 It’s what happens when a known con artist selling “only I can fix it” snake oil takes office
883 2018-08-23 22:07:41 Except Native Peoples cant get theirs back. Neither can the Hawaiians or the Puerto Ricans. So dis-hearting! People not being able to access their native hunting grounds. Laying oil pipes and resource mining seems to be more important.
884 2018-08-23 22:07:40 You claimed oil prices were "plummeting" they are not they are rising.. You also claimed demand was dropping it isn't, it's rising... Before you spew any more nonsense and make yourself look like an even bigger clown, please check you facts..
885 2018-08-23 22:07:33 When the oil money dries up we'd both be fucked though.
886 2018-08-23 22:07:30 Actually when I saw the tweet my mind traveled, but as a strong guy I refused to comment 
887 2018-08-23 22:07:24 There is an old saying.."the squeakiest wheel is the one that gets the oil".  In this day and age its being proven to be so true.
888 2018-08-23 22:07:21 Memories of orange juice and castor oil
889 2018-08-23 22:07:14 Come on. The scene in the Transporter where he covers himself in motor oil and then kicks the pedals off a bike, to then fight the thugs, is peak genre action.
890 2018-08-23 22:07:11 Oil change only $30 wtf lmao
891 2018-08-23 22:07:11 Dammit. I think I want to try and do more oil painting. What is this life?
892 2018-08-23 22:07:07 How can you eat Mashed Yam, ground-nuts, and 2 boiled eggs without palm oil for breakfast? My friend woy3 bossom?
893 2018-08-23 22:07:04 2011:We  spent over a billion on Libya and lead the way---why is Europe getting the oil?
894 2018-08-23 22:06:53 If you don’t vaccinate your kids you deserve to fall into a vat of oil
895 2018-08-23 22:06:44 It is now being said by a professor that coconut oil is poisonous.
896 2018-08-23 22:06:35 The southern oil rich city of Basra, Iraq is facing a health epidemic, large number of people have been effected by unsanitary water.

898 2018-08-23 22:06:03 If what you say is true, you get to experience the pain, the fear, the disgusting feeling of oil in your stomach.
899 2018-08-23 22:06:03 Oh dearie me Bridget, you dare to talk fantasy? 
Do you dream of breast feeding Ross Thompson?
Fucking fantasy - it’s called oil, think what we’d have been able to do with the £billions that tories have wasted on their vanity projects.
900 2018-08-23 22:05:50 Stop lying @DavidMundellDCT  the oil stories don't wash anymore..we know oil is a bonus. Your governments attempts to destroy us with fake GERS figures was so bad the @BBCNews has to apologise.#DissolveTheUnion

905 2018-08-23 22:05:05 Right, it was oil companies that got us addicted, not the demand of EVERYONE! Gimme a break. You know how much oil it takes to keep a wind turbine running?
906 2018-08-23 22:04:58 The reformist Crown Prince #Mohammed bin Salman's plans 2float Saudi Aramco (divest of oil dependancy) r halted after Conservative elements opposed it. They must be aware with temperature hikes similar2 European ones this summer occur in Saudi thenLife outdoors will be impossible
907 2018-08-23 22:04:49 I get that, it looks yummy, but what IS it?

It looks like rosemary focaccia with some oil based dips but I'm not positive.

I have no idea what the drink is.

911 2018-08-23 22:04:18 Briefly: 
- Coconut oil is not poison
- Mixed epi study results on sat fat
- R diff types of sat fat, some bad, some relatively CVD neutral (we like to pretend its simple)
- BUT, is sat fat the most health promoting fat? Unlikely
- Key tho, do u like the taste of coconut 
912 2018-08-23 22:04:18 Have you distance yourself from the out of state environmental anti oil and gas and Ag groups?
913 2018-08-23 22:04:17 High Oil Prices....

..... is National Disaster created by UAE. :-)))

915 2018-08-23 22:04:10 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.

917 2018-08-23 22:03:55 Amin Dr
918 2018-08-23 22:03:54 I expect nothing more after all we are a people who sit at home and the elite spin yarns about why we have to import fuel even though we have one of the largest oil reserves in Africa and we think we are normal in this country... it’s a pity...
919 2018-08-23 22:03:49 You could make some flavored oil for cooking, or dry some of the peppers for future use. That's quite a crop!
920 2018-08-23 22:03:40 The outdoor industry in MT is a $7 billion per year juggernaut that employs almost 70,000 people. But those jobs don't matter to the @MTGOP. 

Just whatever the oil, gas & mining lobby tell them. #mtpol #mtsen #mtal
921 2018-08-23 22:03:19 It’s tomatoe, onion, oil, salt , pepper and cilantro
922 2018-08-23 22:03:05 I mean, I’ve known how unhealthy the stuff is since I worked at a theatre in high school and heard corn popped with coconut oil is super delicious but ridiculously unhealthy.  So we used canola instead
923 2018-08-23 22:03:03 They trynna get coconut oil out the game. Crazy
924 2018-08-23 22:03:01 oil stains are the worst
925 2018-08-23 22:02:58 Mine too. It tells me when the oil is low and when it's time to change the oil. Hell my 2004 Malibu used to  do all that
926 2018-08-23 22:02:50 Where was UAE when you are screaming about HIGH OIL PRICES & blaming government :-))

Why is UAE quiet ??  :-)))
927 2018-08-23 22:02:50 Rosemary focaccia, olive oil and balsamic, with a cappelletti spritz. :)
928 2018-08-23 22:02:49 Yeah, I STILL cant find my oil and I know that as soon as I get some from him I'm going to find the brand new bottle I have here....#fukkinMurphysLaw
929 2018-08-23 22:02:45 Why dude just quote my oil change as $96 my nigga what y’all puttin in my shit gold ?
930 2018-08-23 22:02:37 Good thing oil reserves are unlimited and not a finite resource we should be planning ahead for their inevitable absence
931 2018-08-23 22:02:34 So I randomly decided to burst open a gelatin biotin pill with my fingers and it smells and looks like baby oil inside...don’t know how to feel about this.
932 2018-08-23 22:02:33 I just ate garlic shoots yesterday, sautéed in garlic soy and sesame oil  so good
933 2018-08-23 22:02:10 I WISH I COULD EMBROIDER AND EAT AT THE SAME TIME BUT I DON'T WANT TO GET OIL ON THE FABRIC FFFF
934 2018-08-23 22:02:10 Anyone else find it weird that Qatar made its money from oil. Which is a sovereign asset ( meaning belongs to the people) yet the royal family is the only one making any money. #qatar #harrods
935 2018-08-23 22:02:09 A simple Google search can lead to tons of research as to why you were right. Showering every day isn't healthy. Maybe every other day, or a minimum of twice a week depending on your skin type, but every day washes off an essential layer of oil on your skin you need for both
936 2018-08-23 22:02:06 My Wife said she needs to oil my hair cause it was starting to look ashy 
937 2018-08-23 22:02:06 Subhanallah, Allah ya bata lpya
938 2018-08-23 22:01:50 I just seasoned everything with sesame oil, ginger, coriander, and gochujang. Let it steam finish once the chicken was mostly done.
939 2018-08-23 22:01:50 That’s how I feel bout my wax and oil
940 2018-08-23 22:01:11 I mean you are right, but oil lobby work has destroyed plenty of public transportation initiatives in the last 30+ years here in America.
941 2018-08-23 22:01:00  nah when she came back home I’m like how long did they take for the oil change she said oh bae I bought sushi, just gimmie nother 60 I’ll go tomorrow morning smh I said nigga WHATTTTT??! 
942 2018-08-23 22:00:57 @VP With sanctions on oil and banking, the biggest supporters of terrorism will go to the knee and disappear from the page to help the Middle East and the world get rid of this terrorist regime.
943 2018-08-23 22:00:55 On a while seeet potato butter and salt...  If I slice and grill then a little olive oil spray....
944 2018-08-23 22:00:43 Some professionals have absolutely no integrity. Please do you own research re studies/trials about coconut oil/butter versus vegetable oil and refined nasty “healthy” spreads. Do not believe all the tripe they put out there to keep the    rolling in
945 2018-08-23 22:00:42 Vitamin E oil been clutch for the curls, bless
946 2018-08-23 22:00:39 Are you aware that Steve Malloy was paid by the tobacco industry to promote junk science denying harm from smoke and is now paid by the oil industry to promote junk science that denies AGW? You are legitimizing him referring to "fact-based debate" and implying he is credible.

952 2018-08-23 22:00:04 Venezuela is subjected to economic blockade by USA & EU, threatened by military intervention, encounters barriers to selling their oil & borrowing has been made impossible. Maduro's socialist govt is hated & feared by capitalist govts for putting ordinary working people first
953 2018-08-23 22:00:01 It was the oil companies that pushed wind to put up energy prices. I know because I was in the wind business and all the big players were oil companies.
954 2018-08-23 22:00:01 Grapefruit seed oil also works, apparently.
955 2018-08-23 21:59:53 lmaoooo some nurse just came in wearing her scrubs & bought an oil burner & a lighter. like girrrllll what are you doing???? i don’t trust you around any patients
956 2018-08-23 21:59:48 My mam has taken up oil painting again after yrs away from it. She found Bob Ross videos on YouTube and she’s had to go through a whole falling in love/grieving process in the space of a week after discovering he’s dead.
957 2018-08-23 21:59:43 I feel the same way, Allison.  Just can’t believe they would buy his snake oil
958 2018-08-23 21:59:36 Two oil Paintings from the BP Awards that I much appreciated totally different styles ,  they are not representing a photograph ! Love the paint . Many wonderful Works . N. Portrait Gallery London today.
959 2018-08-23 21:59:08 an oil change for your car is cheap dude you should just go to a shop
960 2018-08-23 21:59:01 Follow instruction on the side of the curry can (though even I use less than instruction. like half as much curry)

simmer it for like 10 mins. nice curry has oil on top from the simmering

Add Salt/Sugar to taste.

Add meat and cook

add veggie (if needed)
961 2018-08-23 21:58:38 Coconut oil tide pods
962 2018-08-23 21:58:20 Please go eclectic and collect what you love! Here is one of the examples of different styles of art in the same home. Beautifully placed paintings by Marleen Vermeulen ( oil on canvas) and Joel Masewich ( acrylic, stainless steel and copper on canvas).
963 2018-08-23 21:58:19 GroUndnut, sesame oil (till ka tel aur moonfali ka) and that too buy directly from extraction.point
964 2018-08-23 21:58:13 I am in Angola ,and im glad we ant  have whites here messing around ,we have full control of the oil ,gold , water ,diamonds , army .Its our land and we dot have to debate with any invader about who was here first , we own it and we fxxxxd the portuguese out .
965 2018-08-23 21:58:11 False. The United States has more known oil deposits than Saudi Arabia. When OPEC squeezes supply, the U.S. produces more. But yeah, “oil war” sounds more dramatic.
966 2018-08-23 21:58:02 This coconut oil stuff is bananas. Are people really this dumb??
967 2018-08-23 21:57:54 Scottie poured veg oil, milk, other stuff all over the floor so they would fall
968 2018-08-23 21:57:50 Mine beans and palm oil rice
969 2018-08-23 21:57:45 anyway good afternoon to everyone except whoever at bmw decided when the air/oil separator fails it should suck all the oil out of the crankcase
970 2018-08-23 21:57:39 - beard oil 
- cologne 
- haircut 
- cute new shirt 

it’s fucken friday and I look fresh as heck
971 2018-08-23 21:57:36 How often? Also Petrol attendants check the water and oil only though. I’ve never heard one asking to check coolant. I’ll get it checked this weekend though.
972 2018-08-23 21:57:11 Because the sanctions do not forbid trade with Venezuela, making business with it, or limiting commercial exchanges. The only real threat to Venezuela oil export is lack of maintenance to the infrastructure because of lack of payments to providers and as a result of legal battles
973 2018-08-23 21:57:01 Bien bajado ese balón. Estamos de acuerdo. 
974 2018-08-23 21:56:55 People that drink Guinness can drink crude oil
975 2018-08-23 21:56:52 Lmaoo i mean I know how to juice it. its possible but nahhhh oil for cooking.
976 2018-08-23 21:56:52 Covered in oil in a not-sexy oh my god I will do anything to unblock this ear kind of way 
977 2018-08-23 21:56:43 Why wouldn't you want a car executive leading sensitive diplomatic meetings with dictators, look how well the oil executive did.
978 2018-08-23 21:56:41 I air dry first because I like my hair when I do that. I only diffuse to add volume, if you have time to fully diffuse your hair then cool, but i never do lol. Apply an oil and then be out the door and continue air drying cause who really got the time sis?
979 2018-08-23 21:56:15 That happened to mine, tea tree oil everyday twice a day . You’re welcome
980 2018-08-23 21:56:14 Coconut oil is losing it's "health halo". I hope it's replaced with intelligence 
#Diet #nutrition #healthyeating
981 2018-08-23 21:56:13 Yes, I added the last  emoji because I found it funny that the professor has deemed herself an all knowing expert about the oil & it’s applications w/out considering the health of the vast amounts of countries & cultures who use the oil, daily & have for many generations.
982 2018-08-23 21:56:13 Rees-Mogg is the biggest snake oil salesman operating today in British politics. All bluster, talking points, and zero substance. A Canada style deal? Canada's biggest trade partner is the US, which it shares a lightly monitored open border, and membership of NAFTA. No comparison

984 2018-08-23 21:56:10 @VP that is, the Iranian terrorist regime should not issue a barrel of oil by November 4, when the sanctions are fully implemented, You will see the result of this and support for terrorism will be stopped completely
985 2018-08-23 21:56:06 Which has more $ - Big Oil Corps or Hollywood? I’m leaning toward the Oil Corps who just asked for billions in taxpayer subsides.
986 2018-08-23 21:56:04 Nothing more than a paid research by olive oil lobby!
987 2018-08-23 21:55:56 Fries need cheese curds and gravy.    The best.  Otherwise, 
aioli (olive oil and garlic emulsion) especially with mussels.
988 2018-08-23 21:55:42 I just got a coconut oil massage in Jamaica and it was magical!
989 2018-08-23 21:55:39 Not necessarily everyday but yes you must frequently check,you can simply ask the petrol attendant when you feel up to check coolant,oil and tire pressure or ask someone who knows to show you because the are precautions to take,like not overfilling your oil and coolant.
990 2018-08-23 21:55:35 @VP As long as the Iranian regime is present in Yemen, the United States should not retreat, this is a strategic mistake. In the case of sanctions that are extremely important for us, there are oil and banking sanctions, that is, no currency should enter Iran
991 2018-08-23 21:55:20 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. 

Yet they are starving due to their socialism. 

BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
992 2018-08-23 21:55:17 Im just gonna tweet all the random things I think of until my oil change is complete.
993 2018-08-23 21:55:16 Whoa, 20 minutes of oil pulling sounds intense! I think I'll have to work up to that 
994 2018-08-23 21:55:09 Finally going to Warri next week. Make we see the oil money y'all screaming about
995 2018-08-23 21:54:48 Its a decent read. But I think it shows that anyone pinning their hopes and dreams onto one thing, one bit of magic, is going to be disappointed. 

and for the record I love coconut oil, it tastes good IMO....
996 2018-08-23 21:54:46 Don't talk to me about how many miles I drive if u not buying gas, oil changes, or tires. I support my own shit.
997 2018-08-23 21:54:36 コストコ、ガソリン車やオートバイ、スクーターを良く乗っていた頃はOILを３ヶ月毎に買いに行ってました。当時は１リットル弱が１本200円以下で買えたんですけど、いまだと500円以下ですかね

1001 2018-08-23 21:54:21 Dishonest propaganda!  Green energy will never provide to high paying, continual jobs that oil and gas do.  Once the solar arrays are constructed by union IBEW workers - it's all min wage folks weeding and cleaning panels.  Very few sustainable jobs after.  Good try though.

1003 2018-08-23 21:53:58 None of them, that’s the point. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting oil futures one summer and Eduardo won’t come close to getting in. The ability to make money doesn’t impress anybody around here.

1006 2018-08-23 21:53:29 My typo, 29,000 gallons converts to 131,836 liters. Splitting hairs here.. Human error can happen anytime in dangerous waters or weather and oil is oil TAR is TAR. Either way it is not supposed to be polluting our oceans, killing marine life and contaminating food.
1007 2018-08-23 21:53:29 Fox News barely reported on Molly Tibbetts until they found out who killed her, now that’s all they’ll talk about. Won’t hear much about the man who murdered his wife a kids and stuck the kids body in oil tanks though.

1010 2018-08-23 21:53:23 If you include cars, then none.  Some countries have massive amounts of renewable energy and little or no coal/oil so they use that for power production.  Like Icelands geothermal.
1011 2018-08-23 21:53:21 It's not about Islamophobia. It's not about antisemitism. It's about oil. Modern Zionism has always been about oil. Israel is a satellite of the USA. Completely dependant on the USA for it's continued existence.

1028 2018-08-23 21:51:50 I'm certain that no Liverpool or Utd fan would be happy with new owners coming from the Middle East with all that baggage. For 8 years now they've proudly announced they'd never want 'oil money' so I'm sure they still feel that way. Otherwise they'd be hypocrites, wouldn't they?
1029 2018-08-23 21:51:38 Permit me to disagree. I’d suggest that pure capitalist /Darwinian rules ought NOT be employed — when dealing with life saving (or life ending) medical treatments. Roy Vagelos (and many before him) took a “stewardship” approach.

Medicine is different than oil — or weapons.
1030 2018-08-23 21:51:34 Ill never understand how labor unions unequivocally back the democrats when the Dems work so hard to destroy entire industries that hire union labor by pandering to their enviro spec interest $$$... i.e., coal, iron and steel, oil and gas, power, etc.
1031 2018-08-23 21:51:29 Coconut oil was a truly miracle treating my grandmother Alzheimer's deasease. Poor people who think that coconut oil is 'pure poinson'.
1032 2018-08-23 21:51:12 Capitalism dictates that someones worth is measured purely by their level of income. It's a system that only really benefits those who are already at the time and gives those at the bottom a broken ladder covered in oil to try and climb up
1033 2018-08-23 21:51:04 Coconut oil isn’t the super food as originally thought. It’s healthy only when you add flax, chia, açaí, turmeric and green tea- all of which must be organic, of course

1040 2018-08-23 21:50:31 I try to do it for 20 minutes each time. Sometimes it's less depending on the time I have, sometimes it's longer. It seems to work best for me when I oil pull in the shower.
1041 2018-08-23 21:50:30 1 We need to have 3 things really clearly worked out.

1047 2018-08-23 21:49:57 Its funny to see a harvard professor claiming that coconut oil is ‘pure poison’, nothing can be more preposterous than this. We Indians have been using it since centuries, and  we are doing more than just ‘fine’. May be someone swapped professor’s sample. #coconutoil

1052 2018-08-23 21:48:55 Yes! Exactly!! For example, my car uses full synthetic oil so an oil change could be up to $80 but since i buy the stuff myself and my boyf helps me w it, i pay up to $40. It really does save money(and time) to know this stuff, and honestly, it’s not hard. It’s called basic-
1053 2018-08-23 21:48:49 Honestly wouldn't mind getting some oil money.
1054 2018-08-23 21:48:49 That’s the good oil right there.
1055 2018-08-23 21:48:32 The oil in the machine. Our heartbeat.

1057 2018-08-23 21:48:15 Haha. So vegans dont use any plastic or oil based products either? That industry kills millions of wildlife, especially sea birds and fish every year. But that doesnt promote their self righteous agenda.
1058 2018-08-23 21:48:14 Talking about food makes me happy, too! Mayo and grape jelly sandwiches sound gross, not a good combination at all. However, I think mayonnaise can be delicious and healthy. It's just oil and eggs, after all, olive oil makes great mayo. It belongs on a BLT.

1062 2018-08-23 21:47:35 Well after all,plastic is made from #oil which contains  primarily hydrocarbons, which are chemicals composed of hydrogen and carbon.Crude oil also contains hundreds of substances that include benzene, chromium, iron, mercury, nickel,sulfur, toluene, and xylene
1063 2018-08-23 21:47:33 Since my childhood , I remember people from India they use oil coconut for their hair especially the ladies.
And also oil coconut  is very good & healthy for cooking.

If you’re selling soap or motor oil, you don’t rely on fans investing their passion & loyalty into your product. MLS needs both [1/2]
1075 2018-08-23 21:46:26 That's the excuse used by the Texas state government to continue underfunding schools and healthcare. Hell it's gotten to the point where even farmers and ranchers want oil and gas to pay more taxes to account for the damage they do to the farm and ranch roads.
1076 2018-08-23 21:46:12 I filed a consumer complaint about #ServiceProOilChange with this AG. He gave my personal information to the corporation and they wrote a letter stating I was a lier.

1086 2018-08-23 21:45:24 Markets also are following preliminary tariff negotiations between China and the U.S., which could prove influential for oil demand should those talks deteriorate and tensions between the two largest economies in the world intensify.

1115 2018-08-23 21:41:50 Two little girls were strangled by their American citizen dad & dumped in a crude oil barrel. They trusted him. Another male American citizen shot his preg girlfriend in the back of the head in a field. What’s their common theme? All men! Prove me wrong.
1116 2018-08-23 21:41:47 As far as I know, coconut oil contains medium-chain fatty acid, which the body changes to energy. In contrast to long-chain fatty acid, medium-chain ones don't cause arterial plaque. She doesn't tell that, her only "proof" that it's bad is the high portion of saturated fatty acid

1121 2018-08-23 21:41:33 But the rain did stop. After all it’s not Ireland. Got 2 x 99s with flakes as we gazed in awe at Christo’s amazing, bizarre, huge, floating, 7,000 oil barrel sculpture on the Serpentine in Hyde Park. A good day. (Know what you mean though - some days it doesn’t stop.)

Reminds me of DJT using Congress to protect DJT ass from Mueller.
1123 2018-08-23 21:41:18 @SenTedCruz gets his big money from oil companies; they’re much wealthier than Hollywood, but there is a price to pay - the latest is $15 billion in Cruz endorsed, taxpayer funded subsidies for those companies.
1124 2018-08-23 21:41:00 Makeup Forever Fullcover Concealer! It’s full coverage so only a tiny bit, and it goes on super smooth. The shade range is good, because a lot of concealers don’t make stuff dark enough. It’s also oil free and doesn’t cause breakouts, and blends well with foundation. 5/5 frfr.
1125 2018-08-23 21:40:54 Do you know which author is my favourite?
Jaroslav Havlíček. He wrote several outstanding novels, based on psychological and mysterious motives. "Oil lamps" and "Invisible" are the best books I have ever read. Are they available in Brazil?

1130 2018-08-23 21:40:08 You're doggone right it's about oil, and your society and your country and a whole lot of stuff thats called living. The statement "meaningless religious conflict" is absolutely meaningless.
1131 2018-08-23 21:39:56 Forgot my wallet at work when I went to get an oil change. They let me drive my car to my job then come back to pay. #thereishopeforthisworld
1132 2018-08-23 21:39:49 Hey Stoney,,ya think POTUS could teach that village idiot up in Canada a thing or two about the economics of being energy independent?? There’s tons of oil in Alberta but he’d rather import oil from the Saudi’s!! DUMBASS
1133 2018-08-23 21:39:21 Maybe if i was more organized and careful I wouldnt be losing all my shit. Maybe if I would done the oil change when it was needed my car would have been fine...

1135 2018-08-23 21:39:02 A rising tide floods all seaside Mansions. Seriously, a Carbon Tax would go a long way to protecting Big Oil and everybody else's coastal assets. A No Brainer even Republicans should be able to comprehend. Of course, they would rather cut Social Security to pay for it.

1137 2018-08-23 21:38:37 What did I miss about coconut oil?
1138 2018-08-23 21:38:25 I see this as symbolic... the people of Africa will have their gold and diamonds, the Muslims will have their oil and right to profit sharing from Hajj.
1139 2018-08-23 21:38:24 Your bio says you sell snake oil.
1140 2018-08-23 21:38:20 Err, how can the US stop Venezuela selling oil to, eg, China?
1141 2018-08-23 21:38:17 The only reason you gave Sessions a job is because of loyalty? What happened to "only the best"?  You have surrounded your office with snake oil salesmen, crooks and racists.  Sounds more like new scum for the swamp. Sessions is  looking like a Boy Scout

1144 2018-08-23 21:37:56 The oil industry is the bane of human kind, not to mention the rest of the earth.  I doubt those jobs will be of any use to us all once we're done destroying the environment.

1151 2018-08-23 21:37:24 Oops, I left the canola oil heat too long for my fries that it started smoking. Took it off the flame and letting it cool down.

Any cooking experts here know if it's a good idea to heat back up or?

1156 2018-08-23 21:36:39 I use it for so many other things. Use it on my face, my nails, my eye brows, my scalp for psoriasis. I switch between that & aloe from the plant. You don’t need to ingest coconut oil.
1157 2018-08-23 21:36:35 Largest oil reserves in the world and they still made arse of it
1158 2018-08-23 21:36:30 Read the Mirrodin books back from when Magic the Gathering had books. Kuva is literally Phyroxian Oil and when it gets involved things do NOT go well.

1159 2018-08-23 21:36:29 90% of plants used for Canola oil in US and Canada are Genetically modified. It is a refined oil and often times it is partially hydrogenated. It is good as an Industrial oil, not for human consumption.

1161 2018-08-23 21:36:18 @_KimberlySnyder What are your thoughts about the Harvard professor slamming coconut oil. Do you still believe it's a good oil option to cook with?
1162 2018-08-23 21:36:07 @SimsonPete You looked lovely on the telly tonight Pete. Do you use a particular wax or oil on your divine facial hair?
1163 2018-08-23 21:36:05 I put a few drops of coconut oil in my mascara and now my lashes are longer I'm a g e n i u s
1164 2018-08-23 21:36:04 What about avacado oil?
1165 2018-08-23 21:35:48 Why doesn't any country in The Handmaid's Tale just invade the US to bring some democracy? They do have oil.

1171 2018-08-23 21:35:15 They should have never gave you negros coconut oil!
1172 2018-08-23 21:35:14 Ok I actually have pimples rn but they're clearing up. I use pixi double cleanse, pyunkang yul essence toner, milk watermelon serum, hada labo hylauranic acid and sweet almond oil. Or as many as those as I can be bothered doing. Oh and exfoliate like once a week w pixi
1173 2018-08-23 21:35:12 You stand in a bedroom, which is nearly empty but for an oil lamp sitting on an end table.
1174 2018-08-23 21:35:09 Buying that "line" all the way. i see...ok, just saying...Mexico get's $25B/ year from remittances (that's more than the make off of the oil)...yo may not like it, but it definitely would work.
1175 2018-08-23 21:35:03 Fam you don't know us . Best believe we ain't the type that acts some type of way that isn't ourselves. I'll take that as a compliment nonetheless. The one behind us tagged along with my guys on a trip and we the type that flows with anyone that got positive vibes.
1176 2018-08-23 21:35:02 Even though coconut oil has its amazing benefits, South Asia does have a high prevalence of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease. A link?
1177 2018-08-23 21:34:51 I need to try them again, I've never liked the protein bars...I am too picky for my own good.  I am shocked at how much better I'm eating than I was, if anyone had told me I'd love cauliflower rice I'd have smacked them!  I do take some MCT oil caplets.
1178 2018-08-23 21:34:45 Of course we need saturated fats, they are essential to our health. I was pointing out a very trendy food marketed as 'healthy' but isnt. Most people are oblivious to the high calorie and sat fat content they are consuming with each meal just by using coconut oil within cooking.

1184 2018-08-23 21:34:04 Oil terminal yesterday, another near a port today, strange eh
1185 2018-08-23 21:34:00 2025, why so long. Paper is available right now. Go shop at TJ’s. Save a few million barrels of oil in the meanwhile. Oil we will need to heat our living spaces, as gasoline will no longer be refined due to fossil fuel exhaustion. It’s coming folks.
1186 2018-08-23 21:33:49 What about the American Husband that murdered his wife, unborn child and two children then proceeded to bury and place two kids in oil drums. #trumpsAgenda #giveUpOnTheWall #impeachTrump
1187 2018-08-23 21:33:43 If I may, what my Scottish colleague is questioning, is why you think the oil is not Scotland's? Yes we're part of the UK, but Scotland is a country with the UK and the oil is in our territory.

1190 2018-08-23 21:33:29 I feel bad for people who thought that green leaf tea oil was a scam. Y’all have no idea how beneficial that is for your liver and how much it can increase the speed at which you burn fat
1191 2018-08-23 21:33:02 The idiocy about 'unknown region' in the rts data has made a major comeback, with various amounts of oil being hidden by the English in it's Narnia-like reaches.

らあさんと同じ世代だったとは意外でしたね。
1193 2018-08-23 21:32:56 We have lots of coupons! Our CBD oil tinctures start at under $20 for 1oz of 120mgs CBD oil.  Hope this helps 
1194 2018-08-23 21:32:56 Oil seriously just doesn’t have any benefits inside the body. All it does is clog your arteries just like animal fat. Get your healthy fats from nuts/seeds, avocado and othe plant based options!
1195 2018-08-23 21:32:50 James 5:14, is anyone among you sick? let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1196 2018-08-23 21:32:47 Oil is one hell of a drug.
1197 2018-08-23 21:32:43 Use some tea tree oil in your moisturizer. 2-3 drops. It should be gone ASAP.
1198 2018-08-23 21:31:42 I just knew you would have the evidence to smash this article to pieces! Thank you!! I wonder if Dr Michels realises that many kids with epilepsy are prescribed MCT oil medically as it is neuroprotective!
1199 2018-08-23 21:31:41 Is coconut oil “pure poison”? A Harvard professor recently ranted about “one of the worst foods you can eat,” but don’t fret just yet. -- HuffPost
1200 2018-08-23 21:31:41 You waited an HOUR FOR AN OIL CHANGE?
1201 2018-08-23 21:31:38 It's about a beautiful Eastern European spy who tryed to stop 120 odd billion Barrels of Oil being extracted from the Weald Basin ...I can say no more.
1202 2018-08-23 21:31:26 “Whats your favorite essential oil?” “Oh it’s youcouldlickthis ;)” 
1203 2018-08-23 21:31:21 Cut it then
1204 2018-08-23 21:31:20 I support this idea, getting an oil change tomorrow & hoping that I’m the only one there so I can turn off the TV to silence whatever annoying morning show is on
1205 2018-08-23 21:31:20 Texas oil companies have enough money to take care of themselves.. What a joke.
1206 2018-08-23 21:31:09 Sure. And oil companies donate our money to Republicans.
1207 2018-08-23 21:31:08 Fuck off you fools. Hope the oil price doubles and, combined with your idiot Dad’s trade tarriffs, sends US into recession and has those amongst the 60m who voted for the muppet and then lose their jobs lynching you all in the street.
1208 2018-08-23 21:30:56 I’ve switched to cooking with mostly avocado oil and I do not regret it one bit. It even helps retain flavor which is awesome when eating clean.
1209 2018-08-23 21:30:56 3. There is kids, women's, & men from many countries being slaughtered as though they have no right to live all in the name of greed hate & control. They are gassing & murdering individuals over oil & property. It needs to stop, no one should have to live in fear of dying..

1216 2018-08-23 21:30:15 Same thing they did here in United States with hemp in order for oil to dominate the plastic Market if hemp was never made illegal we would have had biodegradable Plastics 50 years ago.
1217 2018-08-23 21:30:12 Ight so these dudes been at Walmart for 5 mins bitching their oil change ain’t done yet. I been here for over an hour waiting for mine to get done and haven’t said a word Caz I’m just chilling eating my jerky and drinking my mtn dew.
1218 2018-08-23 21:30:07 Was told that lice don’t live well in oil and most black folk keep a greased scalp. Best move is to be vigilant and keep contact to absolute minimum.
1219 2018-08-23 21:30:04 id personally attribute it to the rose oil spray thats finally helping my redness go away but thats just me ily 
1220 2018-08-23 21:29:54 Big oil and #BLOTUS cronies set to make boo-koo bucks while the environment (thats us, people) suffer the consequences of human enhanced climate change.
1221 2018-08-23 21:29:46 Who's going to take up, the issue of contract staff and casual workers? This is now rampant with oil companies. Nigerians are just slaves in these companies.
1222 2018-08-23 21:29:40 Coconut oil has been in use for centuries by Asians especially for long and healthy hair. My female ancestors survived the use of it!. They died natural deaths.
1223 2018-08-23 21:29:40 Haitian castor oil has been doin wonders on my hair, skin and feet. I can’t live without it.

1227 2018-08-23 21:29:12 Pete could have mainlined some coconut oil to get that big cholesterol high. Surely easier on his constitution than wolfing that lot down.
1228 2018-08-23 21:29:06 Can someone on twitter give me a straight answer if coconut oil will help or fuck in my hair thnx
1229 2018-08-23 21:29:04 I used to work for a climate skeptic lobbying shop (Global Climate Coalition, Google it) funded by the Kochs and the coal and oil industries. I got out when the last vestige of evidence against manmade global warming failed: the satellite data.
1230 2018-08-23 21:29:01 CBD oil with or without TCH has helped with my migraines and for me personally with anxiety, it helps as long as its Indica preferably. I've found that Sativa can up my anxiety with paranoia. Usually put a few drops in chamomile tea.
1231 2018-08-23 21:28:57 Syria, Yemen, Iraq, and wherever oil is found...
1232 2018-08-23 21:28:51 In my first @beautybakerie order, I got the foundation, but didn't get the oil. That has been corrected in my second order. Already plotting the third order for when that gorgeous Lip Whip is restocked.
1233 2018-08-23 21:28:41 Your rogue father has murdered the lives of millions of people through oil subsidy fraud to give you the comfy you are enjoying. What a shame, you are being fed with blood money.
1234 2018-08-23 21:28:35 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!

1244 2018-08-23 21:27:39 'It was always going to be tough to sell investors... until SA can show traction in its economic reforms,... to cut back the country’s vast welfare state' ← No! Saudis wanted high oil price (as b Talal said), which is not compatible with the US demand to increase oil production.
1245 2018-08-23 21:27:38 I will take Yo car while You napping and go get the oil changed or car washed gas it up. All that. And bring it back and not even say nothing. I’ve never met a woman with this same energy. EVER.

1247 2018-08-23 21:27:22 Rosehip oil. I use it religiously to take my makeup off. Take a whole vile. Warm it in your hands. Rub it on your face to loosen up your makeup. Take  warm washcloth and wipe it off. You can add one or two drops to your hands and use it as a moisturizer. Makes your skin less oily
1248 2018-08-23 21:27:17 Lmao i was so nervous for them to do that i literally just kept repeating “nope just an oil change, nOPE JUST an oil change bros if i could do it myself i wouldn’t be here” 
1249 2018-08-23 21:27:07 Tell her put that sushi in her oil reservoir
1250 2018-08-23 21:26:59 You need the medication for being takine in by the snake oil salesmen. Trump voters are either rich, stupid or racist.
1251 2018-08-23 21:26:58 @KuumbaMade I was wondering when the issue with the rollerballs on the 1/2oz size fragrance oils is going to be rectified? Also, why don't you put a rollerball on the 1oz size fragrance oil?
1252 2018-08-23 21:26:47 Biggest Kleptocrats of the World! Oil Companies!
1253 2018-08-23 21:26:35 Oh yeah, because it’s only Alberta who’s benefited from oil revenue. You hate pipelines but not the cash. 
1254 2018-08-23 21:26:04 The rich had record profits. If  the GOP cares for the middle class explain why the middle class tax cuts are temporary & the rich people's tax cut permanent? GOP only cares for the rich.  You are being used by snake oil salesmen. Trump is laughing at you all the way to the bank
1255 2018-08-23 21:25:56 Such as ? 
kill 400,000+ in Afghan and takeover the opium trade NO 
kill 1.5million in Iraq steal the Gold reserves and Oil contracts NO.
Blow Libya to Oblivion killing 400,000+ and steal all the oil contracts ..NO 
yemen ...NO 
palestine NO
1256 2018-08-23 21:25:45 Malthus had not foreseen the power of globalized oil and the non-linear aspect of climate. Cissor effect.
Free trade ideology based on fossil fuels is a total nonsense and leads us to short-term loss on a global scale.
1257 2018-08-23 21:25:41 Black seed oil will have you about to pee on yourself.
1258 2018-08-23 21:25:32 Fill up in case the power goes out and gas pumps don't work or if harbor is damaged and tankers can't deliver oil or if refinery is damaged.
1259 2018-08-23 21:25:24 Cut your ties to Wilson Center, cut your ties to LeadNow, cut your ties to Bilderberg, cut your ties to supply chain management. Cut your ties to Saudi oil, Irving & Aga Khan. Then we can move forward together otherwise you've stuck us with foreign influencers forever. Hypocrite!
1260 2018-08-23 21:25:22 THEY TOPPED OFF YOUR OIL, RIGHT?
1261 2018-08-23 21:25:16 you bleed oil for machine soldiers shut your mouth

1267 2018-08-23 21:24:44 I was born iin New Zealand and prior to oil crises of the 70's we too had a semi socialist society. It worked well for us because of high income,then came the arabs,then the EEC. and it was gone....
1268 2018-08-23 21:24:44 If you haven’t invested in an air fryer you need too it makes food so crispy without any oil or fat 
1269 2018-08-23 21:24:23 Someone is going to have to step up and carry this team offensively if they have any hope. Having the closer leaking oil is just killer.
1270 2018-08-23 21:24:22 $80 for an oil change??? Got me all the way fucked up
1271 2018-08-23 21:24:19 It reminds me a lot of oil pastels!
1272 2018-08-23 21:24:14 @JasonWWMT soy oil has lots of plant estrogens in them.  Lower heart disease rates in places that use coconut oil

1276 2018-08-23 21:23:38 Sitting at jiffy lube and the 3 girls across from me are talking about how they drove all the way across town because apparently you can only get an oil change at one place and you can never go to any other jiffy lube... wish someone would’ve told me that rule!
1277 2018-08-23 21:23:32 Car workshops in germany are same as in india . Took my car two weeks ago to the workshop as the oil lamp was blinking .. the guy connects a computer and says .. A,B,C.. gone .. replace .. and gives me a hefty quote...

1285 2018-08-23 21:22:43 My mechanic place that works on my car sends me updates saying I need to come in for an oil change with the car I had 2 cars ago lol
1286 2018-08-23 21:22:38 CASTOR OIL IS A FKIN MIRACLE
1287 2018-08-23 21:22:28 One of these pay pigs or sugar daddies should send me $100 for my oil change
1288 2018-08-23 21:22:26 Everything he said is true. Is a reality that bayern compete against oil teams as is a reality that if Bundesliga opponent want to get stronger, oil owners are their solution. So.... Shame you.
1289 2018-08-23 21:22:13 Once i get this oil change ima pull up to the car week events 
1290 2018-08-23 21:22:09 Still selling your snake oil I see.

"Look at me!" "My bigly words!"
Sad!

1292 2018-08-23 21:22:05 Winter food prep for freezer is going to be no oil  homemade dhal with spinach, chilli with soy mince ...and veg and chickpea curry. Maybe also beansprouts, onion, cashews, pineapple and soy sauce. Under 2 hrs to make it all and 20 meals done. Yay !

1295 2018-08-23 21:21:46 ONE Person Said Coconut Oil Is Bad Now Everyone Wants To Stop Using It.
1296 2018-08-23 21:21:33 Unfortunately she used some adulterated version coconut oil...not what we use. I haven’t seen the study but would b curious who funded it
1297 2018-08-23 21:21:17 Ha, I have been to Pithole.  Also, we used to stay in a cabin with my grandparents in Oleopolis (near Oil City, natch) where Pithole Creek ran into the Allegheny River.
1298 2018-08-23 21:21:08 In my ass backwards state, ppl would rather I drink than do Cannabis. So I don’t drink - I just say it’s cbd oil and I’m “cool”. Can’t say I take MMJ to control pain - that would be !!!  Stupid southern hick doctors.

1303 2018-08-23 21:20:40 When people tell me they're from/live in/just moved to Oil City, my uninhibited, automatic response is always, "I'm sorry." And I realize that that's offensive, but it's definitely not as offensive as Oil City. #SorryNotSorry #ButImSorry
1304 2018-08-23 21:20:19 Mike Pence had to have been involved. Putin picked Pence and Rex Tillerson. Pence's brother was chairman of a company, Cummins Engines, which had Uber heavy dealings with Russia. Tillerson had personal oil interest in Russia. How did Pence & Tillerson obtain a security Clearance?
1305 2018-08-23 21:20:13 So I had plans on vlogging my day today (intro made), getting Logan a haircut, getting an oil change & car wash.... but my kid is sleeping. Dude............. I’m hungryyyyyyy. This feels like the longest nap he’s ever taken.
1306 2018-08-23 21:19:57 I think it's pretty self explanatory... it helps u tan. Pretty sure spain has its own brands for tanning oil, in Greece there's one called Carroten. Just don't buy from nivea or high end brand like that cuz they don know shit
1307 2018-08-23 21:19:49 How do think this Oil £ value ( Which is currently Revenue to the Private Companies)  changes the Public deficit numbers ?

1317 2018-08-23 21:18:53 Nah. In this case, it would be more apropos to go for either a Midnight Oil song, or a Doctor Who reference. #auspol #libspill
1318 2018-08-23 21:18:51 Didn’t we already do that? (See: Harvey, etc) Also, should those poor pay for this spine as in this proposal or should the oil companies who have outsourced every other externality?
1319 2018-08-23 21:18:47 With the way my grandpa cooks the groceries I buy , the US army is close to kicking down my door and invading the pan , way too much oil yo

1323 2018-08-23 21:17:42 How many champions leagues has your oil money club won
1324 2018-08-23 21:17:34 I'm also a-okay with hot sauce weirdly! I had tnought about different qualities of oil... that's a great tip. I'll have to upgrade whats in my kitchen because I loooove fried fatty things haha
1325 2018-08-23 21:17:34 It is all about the oil and the money to the EU. EU has no sense of the danger Iran is to the world and they don't care.
1326 2018-08-23 21:17:31 anyways i regret not studying earlier because i have to constantly burn midnight oil starting from today because this exam content is heavy af
1327 2018-08-23 21:17:17 Yes you gonna have it all for you and the cunts like you but without the oil and gas money that comes from Scotland 
Cant wait myself.
1328 2018-08-23 21:17:06 Made my blood boil reading the uninformed idiots commenting on the NYT piece.  

Folk thought the world was flat. 

They now think oil sands is nothing but dirty. 

Tech advanced change and disruptive common held thoughts.

1333 2018-08-23 21:16:43 Well, the Trump/Russia scandal certainly has massive implications, is the worst in history.  We never had to consider whether Nixon was a traitor.  But your conspiracy?  You fail to explain how all this oil and water could mix.  Too many conflicting agendas and loyalties.
1334 2018-08-23 21:16:14 There is a disturbing lack of rosemary and olive oil triscuits in this god forsaken world
1335 2018-08-23 21:16:10 We are all experiencing Global Warming.  It’s a fact.  Everyone negotiating it, waste of time.  We all need to take action individually instead of waiting for a leader.  We’re smarter than that.  We need to put an end to oil dependency.
1336 2018-08-23 21:16:08 Gurl, dope oil spot. She lacks judgment picking that spot for this. She got the phone sitting on someone's hood?
1337 2018-08-23 21:16:04 Haven’t checked the coolant,oil etc since I bought my car 2years ago
1338 2018-08-23 21:16:01 Goooooooooooooooo American oil! Nothing like not being captive to OPEC and other foreign nations. Cant wait til socialism in Venezuela ends and the people there begin to benefit from their own nations wealth-no longer starving and crying out for food and medicine. HATE SOCIALISM!
1339 2018-08-23 21:16:00 We should not be finding oil companies. We should be funding health care for those who cannot afford it.
1340 2018-08-23 21:15:53 Huh? When weren’t we exporting? We’re the #3 oil producer world wide. Are you saying that’s because of fracking? Maybe you mean reshaping the world bc of increased seismic activity? Poisoned watershed? Inefficient way of energy extraction? Exploiting nonrenewable resource?
1341 2018-08-23 21:15:29 Now playing I Need Your Oil by E. Dewey Smith, Jr. & The House of Hope Atlanta!
1342 2018-08-23 21:15:20 What's really ironic is the gulf coast oil refineries asking government help from the effects of climate change. Takes some brass.
1343 2018-08-23 21:15:16 The essential oil bath I just took was exactly what I needed
1344 2018-08-23 21:14:58 Lzndrieu on the board of Genie Energy which has contracts to drill for oil in the Golan Heights.. who are you trying to kid?
1345 2018-08-23 21:14:50 Looks nice at the end. A bit of work goes into that, though. A few more chops, and some oil and salt, and you can just have some sauteéd veggies.
1346 2018-08-23 21:14:36 Correct me if I'm wrong but would a lot of that have to do with high oil prices? I.e very high tax returns on that production
1347 2018-08-23 21:14:29 I Always Get My Oil Changed Tho 
1348 2018-08-23 21:14:28 Land of India and its denizens have been using Coconut oil for millenia for cooking, frying.
I have used this oil from hair-to-toe for massage; even for minor cuts & bruises. Mind you- my skin & hair glow at age of 37.
1349 2018-08-23 21:14:15 This coconut oil has my legs GLOWING

1351 2018-08-23 21:14:00 Thank u thank u they’re currently working on my white house oil painting as we speak
1352 2018-08-23 21:13:55 Peanut butter low carb with coconut oil, milk and chips + berries + chia + lino seeds. That was my “lunch” today.
1353 2018-08-23 21:13:48 I really dont feel like getting my oil changed after work
1354 2018-08-23 21:13:48 Hit me up next time your are in Chicago. Will have you over for a koosa-palooza. In the mean time slice into coins or strips, roast in the oven with a little salt and olive oil, optional bread crumbs and grated Parmesan.
1355 2018-08-23 21:13:46 As for destroying, I also heard recently that in Indonesia the government encourages cutting down and burning forests, even with different chemicals so palm trees can be planted for oil, trees that absorb 10x less CO2
1356 2018-08-23 21:13:46 I'm not gonna let you stay under that bus, bitch. The oil leaks will ruin your hair.
1357 2018-08-23 21:13:44 In my alt history the Kremlin had Trump invest in Scotland to position him to gum up wind energy programs in the UK so they could keep oil prices high. Kind of like how pushing coal and putting tariffs on solar panels does the same.
1358 2018-08-23 21:13:42 Thank you fair lady like red oil.
1359 2018-08-23 21:13:11 The scent of The Goulds is thick as molasses this evening. Feel like I need my oil skins to step outdoors.
1360 2018-08-23 21:13:10 Are you doing a video on how to clean finger oil off keyboards?
1361 2018-08-23 21:12:51 Brought to you by the Big Three and Big oil. Not saying it can't possibly be true, but always be skeptical when institutions keep trying to create more and more smut.
1362 2018-08-23 21:12:45 They played with their intelligence that's why isn't even about the money Sir
1363 2018-08-23 21:12:44 Moms burnt oil n burnt pans before but nothing smoked us out like today.
1364 2018-08-23 21:12:40 why are we exporting oil? I thought ‘drill baby drill’ was to increase supply and lower prices at home? Oh right, lies.
1365 2018-08-23 21:12:39 What about disposable lighters, I see them more than any other object on the beaches here. Ballons I see many ribbons from ballons, Evil Ballon!. What about all the plastic toy's and all oil based beach toys sold? It's all plastic.
1366 2018-08-23 21:12:38 No, they don’t. That video was a fraud. Oil companies do contribute to the deaths of infants by poisoning our environment.
1367 2018-08-23 21:12:33 Coconut oil is a major export for many countries and processed coconut oil to form other products has been used for many purposes, how can this professor make such a claim without considering this? Also in comparison to what others?
1368 2018-08-23 21:12:32 The same way we subsidize farmers to the tune of 10's of billions.. oil industry to the same tune.. 
Canadian cedar prices went up significantly last year with tariffs.. who paid for it.. THE US CONSUMER. I passed the cost on to my customers. what should have been 18k was 24k now
1369 2018-08-23 21:12:32 The guy behind was dumbfounded and can't bliv his friends were gonna pull up this karya  he wasn't preinformed
1370 2018-08-23 21:12:24 Ima start going to the gym doped up on cbd oil 
1371 2018-08-23 21:12:23 Also basic economics: everything is made from oil.

1374 2018-08-23 21:12:01 I love the fact that you are 100% positive that your Italian friend will just have oil and vinegar sitting around. A very useful guy! 
1375 2018-08-23 21:11:50 My thoughts exactly . Kirstie Alley wont answer questions about being a Scientologist. When asked if there is a believe in god she says “only if u want there 2 be” . Shady. Snake oil salesman sounding , eh? And she claims 2 have met Prince Charles at Courtney Loves house ?
1376 2018-08-23 21:11:43 Jerry you guys are going to save the planet and not wreck it.  $PQEFF. The tree hugging gimps need to smell the coffee and be thankful. The tech you guys hold could repair what’s unrepairable worldwide with the stain the existing oil sands industry left on the planet.
1377 2018-08-23 21:11:33 Makes sense. The word is that palm oil is the worst of the oils to consume, not good for your health with too much saturated fat ... maybe just propaganda though. But recreating an animal habitat and subsequent reserve is a good thing. How much money is required? Will it work?
1378 2018-08-23 21:11:27 Yes they do sell baby parts! Where the heck have you been hiding? Oil companies don't kill and sell baby parts around the globe!
1379 2018-08-23 21:11:19 Who’s the oil painting sitting with worst president ever?
1380 2018-08-23 21:11:17 Women get a car & don’t check the oil, tire pressure, coolant, no nothing. They just wake up & drive that mf .
1381 2018-08-23 21:11:16 I agree. What the green lobby need to remember is that oil sands are environmentally  unfriendly places. Petroteq technology and processes return those areas back to nature in a habitable form.

1384 2018-08-23 21:11:05 coconut oil causes arthritis spread the word
1385 2018-08-23 21:10:46 Yes that’s what I’m thinking. (Rather than have Saudi oil.) Research should be made into plastic manufacture, but until then we probably need to sell our oil, refine it and use it. I’m keen to clean the environment but when I look at the amount of plastic in cars etc.....#cdnpoli
1386 2018-08-23 21:10:45 I can attest to that, but you don’t have to go to West Texas, you can easily make the same amount in Southeast Texas or Houston. I’ve been working in the oil industry for ten years and I make well over 100k. It’s pretty great, also dangerous.

1389 2018-08-23 21:10:07 @love_prezzo tonight at your Beckenham restaurant you must have had the work experience chef in, burnt seabass & burnt truffle oil fries, plus wrong main in the party too. I would've been embarrassed to bring them to the table. POOR #sortoutthechef
1390 2018-08-23 21:10:05 サラダ油は野菜って言ったら変な顔されたよ。サラダってついてるのに本当に馬鹿だなあ。
1391 2018-08-23 21:10:03 During the campaign, Trump said that he would bomb the hell out of the middle east & take their oil. Putin, big mover mob members & Trump are deeply entangled in oil & I'm wondering if an oil grab may be a tactic to postpone the election?
1392 2018-08-23 21:09:59  @ fall inside oil,  I choked on my drink.
1393 2018-08-23 21:09:50 About time. Was once sat in a mouse waiting about 5 mins for it to start. Then some guy in overalls covered in oil and shit popped his head up through the track and said “let’s give it go and see what happens”.  Never been so terrified in my life.
1394 2018-08-23 21:09:47 Started the war to suppress his own dissenting, starving, desperate people & happy to kill them, in huge numbers
Turkey & ISIL capitalised on that & joined in
Putin cares only about keeping Assad in power, it’s a foothold in oil rich Middle East
He’s not there as a humanitarian
1395 2018-08-23 21:09:37 My pain we  is can't even own gold because they know when this financial system goes down real money gold silver an oil will go up .But by the time they would have  stolen all those resources from the Black's an Arabs.
1396 2018-08-23 21:09:36 Hey, I hear ya about the misinformation with LP products.  There are even ppl promoting vaping MCT Oil !!!  Can't believe it.
1397 2018-08-23 21:09:28 I also just ate like a ton of olive oil, so maybe that’s why.
1398 2018-08-23 21:09:27 COCONUT OIL

1402 2018-08-23 21:09:06 I’m really interested in buying coconut oil now.
1403 2018-08-23 21:09:02 It's kinda funny there are plenty of people on here talking plenty about the molly tibbits murder but none of y'all are talking about the guy who murdered his pregnant wife and 2 daughters and put them IN OIL BARRELS. Why do you think that is?
1404 2018-08-23 21:08:51 You see where Venezuela is now, that is where Jonathan was taking us to
Thank God we banished him to Otuoke
Arungun omo, at'oKo wa'baleje

Don't forget like Nigeria, Venezuela also rely on oil.

@OfficialPDPNig knew this but looting is what made them to keep quiet.
1405 2018-08-23 21:08:48 Any ever take CBD oil & if so what do you think of it ? 
#CBD
1406 2018-08-23 21:08:47 They don’t sell “baby parts”. And I’m wondering if you are also against corporate welfare to oil companies?
1407 2018-08-23 21:08:46 So I just want a tuna steak baked  with olive oil rose Mary thyme and garlic like is that to much to ask
1408 2018-08-23 21:08:43 lemon juice, ya minced garlic, old bay a lil lemon pepper n complete some butter or u can use olive oil if u wanna be healthy
1409 2018-08-23 21:08:43 I can imagine engine oil tasting like Pepsi max
1410 2018-08-23 21:08:31 Venezuela suppose to have the highest oil reserve in the world. How did the reach  the state they in
1411 2018-08-23 21:08:21 The matter tired me,her type are those that copy assignment with the name of the person they copied from
1412 2018-08-23 21:08:19 Thanks Louisa! Yep - I really love the richness you can achieve when mixing avocado and olive oil! 
1413 2018-08-23 21:08:14 Everyone askes me wat i put in her hair , i only use this white shea cream & tea tree oil to keep her hair from looking dried out

But Reggie and dbacks on draft day are like oil & water.

1417 2018-08-23 21:07:37 I never believed that life in Nigeria is so tough nowadays until I saw a man eating bread  with Annoiting Oil.
1418 2018-08-23 21:07:15 Mix it with a little French mustard, olive oil and pepper. Totally different beast.
1419 2018-08-23 21:07:14 Perhaps the bell pepper was a cone before the hammer smashed it...
1420 2018-08-23 21:07:12 My AC is blowing burnt oil smoke into my dorm room rn. I might die :/
1421 2018-08-23 21:07:06 I put peppermint oil on my lips and it feels so refreshing wow
1422 2018-08-23 21:07:06 Your gonna be impeached and you will go to Jail! Bring the coconut oil and get ass ready!
1423 2018-08-23 21:07:06 Every politician is either covering up treason, committing treason or trying to block fascism. Who is seeing to the daily business? 
When W. was in office science was set back a decade. Oil companies want us to prop them up. We should be 100% renewable, by now. We are dinosaurs.
1424 2018-08-23 21:07:01 Tried a slightly different route around the construction on #ChiLFT. At Montrose I went under LSD then took Marine Drive south to Belmont. Aside from the fresh oil on much of it, that worked pretty well. I anticipate the oil to be covered with fresh asphalt today or tomorrow.
1425 2018-08-23 21:06:39 I'm literally rapid cycling like a mofo between anxiety and utter ugly crying... so I naturally went a d bought CBD oil. PLEASE SAVE ME!
1426 2018-08-23 21:06:34 There was a wee lad that started working for me years ago in Glasgow. He got a deep fried Mars bar supper for his lunch every day for a month and was off for a week! Quite a fine art to making them apparently! If it splits you need to change the oil in the fryer.
1427 2018-08-23 21:06:31 The best part about going to an hbcu is being about to just randomly put oil in my hair and people just understand my life struggles 
1428 2018-08-23 21:06:28 Shame to see conservatives turn their backs on their own principles for oil money. Soon they won’t even be able to enjoy the land they stole from native Americans.
1429 2018-08-23 21:06:08 Your going to Jail! Get your butt ready and bring the coconut oil!
1430 2018-08-23 21:06:08 You use baby oil on ya self, or just the filter my G!? 
1431 2018-08-23 21:05:58 CBD oil is a form of cannabis but when you give it to your dog it can't have any more than 2% THC because that's not good for a dog. Maybe just give her a crushed MSM tablet and a dash of tumeric in her food. If its really bad she can have 1 aspirin. Not coated just regular.
1432 2018-08-23 21:05:54 We are slowly losing our culture in Africa, I just saw a guy from Trotro washing his hands after eating Bofrot instead of rubbing the oil on his head. Ohh my learned Africa brothers 
1433 2018-08-23 21:05:38 I agree, We're a long way from oil independence, but we should still continue to innovate to move away from it. That being said.. I'd prefer Canadian oil, distributed by pipeline over foreign oil by freight.
1434 2018-08-23 21:05:36 Go to Europe and buy some kief and then get back to me...  Are people getting confused by the "WEED" label too?  Meanwhile LPs just make up "Cannabis oil" which is really a cannabis tincture (at best), and no one bats an eye even though actual people are trying to VAPE it?!
1435 2018-08-23 21:05:35 Rather than be against it the greens need to embrace #Petroteq the world needs oil especially the  $PQEFF will supply and help others produce in an environmentally friendly manner. Don’t fight against them. This is the real deal and it benefits all agenda’s.
1436 2018-08-23 21:05:21 Your going to Jail! Get your butt ready and bring the coconut oil!
1437 2018-08-23 21:05:07 Trump's first EPA pick, oil-industry pal Scott Pruitt, tried to roll back oil regulations.
Pruitt's replacement, coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler, rolls back coal regulations.

Their corruption is about more than Russia/tax-evasion/stealing -- it literally makes it harder to breathe.
1438 2018-08-23 21:04:49 Epsom salts are better for the bath. But when it comes to CBD oil you’re best ingesting it. If you recreationally or medically consume pot your tolerance might be high. Try sublingual method. 
1439 2018-08-23 21:04:48 Why do we have to import oil if we have so much?
1440 2018-08-23 21:04:48 Here's a hint of olive oil, and a REALLY sweet letter and I'm still freaking out about it.
1441 2018-08-23 21:04:44 The neutrgena face wipes in the little blue pack have like oily substance and those helped me. But it’ll take a couple tries. Also Vaseline and coconut oil. Basically any oily substance should help
1442 2018-08-23 21:04:39 Your going to Jail! Get your butt ready and bring coconut oil!

1444 2018-08-23 21:04:26 Economy diversification in what terms? How can you shamelessly say Nigeria ain't dependent on oil, why did Buhari usurp the position of petroleum minister from the inception of his governance? Buhari has caused a loss over 10 million jobs and you say he's made our economy better.
1445 2018-08-23 21:04:05  stil spinning afta ol this. I admire your resolve even tho ukutengesera vanhu snake oil. They ar stil buyin it waona
1446 2018-08-23 21:04:01 I hope the guy doing my oil change doesn’t judge my container of Mac and cheese and pulled pork on the seat....  no shame. Got it at work
1447 2018-08-23 21:03:59 I saw a kid posting on the Nextdoor app for our neighborhood asking if anyone needed any house or yard work done because he was trying to get money for nice art supplies. So I messaged him and told him that I’d give him a bunch of painting stuff. Canvases, oil paint, brushes
1448 2018-08-23 21:03:56 I just spilled like half the bottle of mint fragrance oil on my sewing desk...  at least now my workspace is minty fresh

1450 2018-08-23 21:03:41 Cleary Venezuela didn’t waste their oil wealth on unproductive segments of the economy.
1451 2018-08-23 21:03:37 Despite the fear from eating low carb and coconut oil, we are continuing to eat like the royals. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth is 92 and hubby even older.. Both on a low carb lifestyle. I want to grow up like them 
1452 2018-08-23 21:03:34 Should I listen to the first of the second season of Midnight Oil?

1456 2018-08-23 21:03:04 People of B.C. stand with our premier and native groups against insane oil sands project. Oil sands is hell and we want Alberta to keep it's hell to itself and NOT to infect rest of us thinking beings.
1457 2018-08-23 21:03:00 Using trucks and trains to transport oil will bring more danger to people and environment. But let’s not care about that. 
1458 2018-08-23 21:02:53 But packed full of palm oil these days. I’ve moved to the Ryvita.
1459 2018-08-23 21:02:30 "Good job", what part precisely..? 
Is it the rise of prices due to your trade war..? Is it the inflation of Oil price due to the cancellation of the Iranian deal..? Is it your withdrawal from the TPP making farmer to struggle with their production..?
1460 2018-08-23 21:02:25 Way to go C. Freeland. Stay strong. When can we expect a timetable regarding the cancellation of foreign oil contracts?
1461 2018-08-23 21:02:21 I'm still mourning the £2.95 I paid for "dirty fries" the other day....was meant to be fries with parmesan and truffle oil....opened the box when I got home and it was clearly McCains oven chips with some cheese thrown on  I've never eaten chips so angrily
1462 2018-08-23 21:02:19 I take mine in because I don't have time to do it/ I am lazy. But I do check my coolant and oil because sometimes sensors lie.
1463 2018-08-23 21:02:17 Got to love the simple blend of kaolin, calamine and Turkish rose oil in this fresh treat!  Have you used any of our other skin care products before?
1464 2018-08-23 21:02:06 Same with oil. There's alternatives but our government don't want that because big oil pays them to not change things
1465 2018-08-23 21:02:01 Here is the real story of oil. The US consumes 18 million barrels a day. Of that, the US produces 10 million barrels a day. The remainder is imported, mostly for the Middle East. We remain a dependent energy dependent country despite. Hannity, tell us where we are wrong
1466 2018-08-23 21:01:56 The oil industry (Exxon) that used 100million$ of the money you paid them for gas on lying propaganda against climate change and sea level rise is now asking your government to use your tax dollar$ to save them from sea level rise. Please re-tweet #EXXONripoff
1467 2018-08-23 21:01:56 ... But "get the Trump out of here" don't sound too wrong, does it? I mean, pours like oil, right?
1468 2018-08-23 21:01:55 I'll make an oil to go with it, we can sell it as a set. 
1469 2018-08-23 21:01:54 Mom burnt a pan of canola oil. Whole house of very very thick smoke instantly. Most out now but still burns eyes & smells like burnt plastic, cardboard, n stale fish.

Mom open windows, kitties were crying n scared. Jimmy threw up.
1470 2018-08-23 21:01:41 Listening to #cavuto is like drinking a gallon of Castor oil. All you have to show for it is pile of steaming mud.

1473 2018-08-23 21:01:16 I forgot my roommate spilled a bunch of oil in the oven and never cleaned it so I lit that boy up and am just praying it doesn't burst into flames. I just really want this pizza.
1474 2018-08-23 21:01:07 So we’ll construct N.O.-type infrastructure around every coastal city threatened by sea level rise? That would take approximately all the money on the planet. Better we put the oil companies out of business.

1476 2018-08-23 21:00:55 By December 2014, Nigeria Oil was already selling at almost $64/Barrel and yet the administration maintained Economic growth at 6%.

But according to y'all nothing is ever Buharis fault.

1480 2018-08-23 21:00:38 CBD oil will never come from the vet. You would have to buy it online. It would help her with arthritis and joint pain. If you buy it make sure it is 2% THC, and no more and it will be okay. I give my dog MSM and tumeric in his food. It helps with joint pain too. Rest is good!
1481 2018-08-23 21:00:33 OK... Good to know. Doesn't hurt to get people emailing their protest regardless of where they are in the process. It's a terrible idea. Look at what happened when oil palms were planted for biofuels. 
1482 2018-08-23 21:00:30 Nothing better than getting an oil change and hearing the technicians crack on each other

1487 2018-08-23 21:00:13 Lol so guilty, patrol attendants always ask me if the oil and water is still ok n I am like I think so, guess the car will alert me
1488 2018-08-23 21:00:06 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats
1489 2018-08-23 21:00:05 The reasons for that are different. In many cases public schools fail because people like you would rather give subsidies to the same oil companies and pharmaceuticals rather than abundantly fund schools to reduce class sizes and hire more staff.
1490 2018-08-23 21:00:05 My family can no more get along with your family than oil mixes with water.
ぼくの家族と君の家族が仲良く過ごせるというのは，水と油が混ざるというくらいありえない話だ。

1492 2018-08-23 20:59:49 Don't suck just change my oil!
1493 2018-08-23 20:59:45 Coconut oil maybe?¿
1494 2018-08-23 20:59:42 "cough" "cough" "hack" "wheeze" "sneeze" - my reaction in quotes... others have noted it's ok for BC to put us in AB at certain risk with its pollution but not for AB oil to transit BC at less very small risk than has been involved already for over 50 years (not perfect parallel)
1495 2018-08-23 20:59:38 COV should demand all oil tankers have full insurance for billlions for a spill vs token 10-25 million. Not sure they could but should try & pressure feds
1496 2018-08-23 20:59:38 They ALL lie every single one of them say and do what benefits them not the American people. The Democrats been doing it for years. Taking money from big oil, pharma, wherever they can. Look at all these drugs they prescribe that destroy and kill people. Why are they still legal?
1497 2018-08-23 20:59:36 What do they say about white guy in Colo who strangled two little girls and wife and dumped bodies in oil pit? Ok for white guy to kill people?
1498 2018-08-23 20:59:35 Baby! Now I can get my big pot lid, the popcorn kernels and the oil!
1499 2018-08-23 20:59:20 how is #FreedomOfSpeech a crime? The protesters have a right to be there and stand up to Big Oil and #TarSands.

1501 2018-08-23 20:59:06 I got a free face oil today in the mail from glamglow and wow it must be amazing to be a beauty guru and constantly get free things sent to you by companies.
1502 2018-08-23 20:58:43 Daily mail is sexist rag run by old white perverts: dirty old men who are operating like oil sands advocates with reptile brains. Be careful what you wish for you just might get more than you bargained for.R.Knotley is amoral tyrant. She puts burdens on world's poor: like death
1503 2018-08-23 20:58:32 Did he offer a blessing with extra oil?

1506 2018-08-23 20:58:09 And remember, those “ponds” are merely a cost saving planning measure for urban runoff water (rentention ponds instead of sewers) and contain anything that drains from our streets. This can be oil, fuel or any other toxin that may be in the surface. They need to test this water.

Then it died...

Then I caught some oil on fire...

1517 2018-08-23 20:56:22 Need help??...I’ll go over to the nursing home, oil up the boys walkers, and send them out to break some legs...( They are a little slower these days, but once you break a few hundred legs.... you have it down to a  science!!!)
1518 2018-08-23 20:56:09 The US didn't go into Iraq for oil. Bush was simply stupid and allowed a neocon network to drag US in @xxTIKExx @houhemhard @FernandoAmandi

1523 2018-08-23 20:55:40 Prince George already is an pulp mill town and we have chronic rates of cancer. J.

1526 2018-08-23 20:55:19 Who mentioned Crude Oil in this conversation. ?
1527 2018-08-23 20:55:13 Hey, there's a white guy in Denver who strangled his pregnant wife & two young daughters under the age of 5. He disposed of the kids bodies by dumping them in an oil tank on the land of his former employer. The kids bodies weren't found for about 4 days. But he's white so - okay?
1528 2018-08-23 20:54:51 U cannot kneel down but traditionally speaking they passed you lists of tubers yams probably with gallons of palm oil to give to him.

1529 2018-08-23 20:54:44 Here was my local news watching experience today: 1st: Woman suing Jersey Mikes for getting fired because after working one week she went on maternity leave 2nd: is coconut oil PURE POISON? It has same fat as red meat. 3rd story: are woman’s pockets too small? Tune in after break
1530 2018-08-23 20:54:43 Evening primrose oil!!! I swear that is what put me into labor when I was pregnant with Sebastian
1531 2018-08-23 20:54:41 I covered this last night. Nigeria is a singular exception due to it's vast oil wealth. They don't export live animals, meat, dairy, tobacco or coffee.
You're grasping again. Pick something a GSP country does export to the EU.
Being abusive doesn't win your failed argument.
1532 2018-08-23 20:54:41 Nah
1533 2018-08-23 20:54:32 But like, mom-and-pop greasy spoons, you know, the kind with a jug of butter-flavored Crisco under the grill, I need to avoid. Ditto any fryshack with old or not-hot-enough oil, which is a damned shame.
1534 2018-08-23 20:54:28 Thanks! (Did I ever show you my oil painting of a polar bear in a snowstorm?)
1535 2018-08-23 20:54:26 There is wisdom in this but I also think people are both teachable & responsive to incentives. If you want your team to burn the midnight oil & think/act like “owners”, then you have to both train/mentor & provide worthwhile incentives that can bring out that level of effort.
1536 2018-08-23 20:54:24 So Iran beat us at our own game. i think this can be directly related to Modi buying less and less oil from Iran and they took revenge.
1537 2018-08-23 20:54:20 Weren't we supposed to run out of oil already? There are too many damn cars
1538 2018-08-23 20:54:18 Or of course, @UNFCCC @COP24 @UNDP @350 could continue listening to the likes of Dr Kissinger, but geopolitical population reduction is pretty resource intensive in itself; just look at oil demands of combined allied forces of @NATO and the short sighted #FrackThePlanet approach.
1539 2018-08-23 20:54:12 We need more oil and coal power. How else are you gonna power your electric cars?
1540 2018-08-23 20:54:09 And every day that goes by, more and more oil is being poured onto that slide. Dotard's in for quite a ride soon and I can hardly stand the waiting.

1542 2018-08-23 20:54:04 When people just say things (sigh)--> RT @DiSocaAnalyst: Coconut oil = poison is just part of a new expansion pack for tricknology 120 degrees. It came with the wash vegetables but not meat update
1543 2018-08-23 20:53:50 @VICE did a haunting episode on this very thing. Palm oil production, as it is currently conducted, is really not sustainable at all. Terrible for people’s health who eat it and homes who live near the farms, and the habitats it utterly destroys. #boycottpalmoil
1544 2018-08-23 20:53:48 I'm pretty sure you can do just about anything with baking soda and coconut oil. Brush your teeth, moisturize your scalp, clean your kitchen, end world hunger, take over the world... The possibilities are endless!

1546 2018-08-23 20:53:29 Urban has always had that snake oil salesman aura about him. He is responsible for getting Utah into the PAC-12 so I’ll always respect him for that but man is he a sinister character.
1547 2018-08-23 20:53:14 Did that guy make a video about the Colorado man who murdered his wife and two daughters and then tried to hide their bodies in oil drums?
1548 2018-08-23 20:53:14 Fantasy! Keep trying.

1550 2018-08-23 20:53:07 Great for you. He touts we are producing and selling more oil. Gas is still at $3 a gallon. His tariffs has caused steel prices to rise. Defend all you want but don’t yell it’s good for every one. That’s fake news!

1554 2018-08-23 20:52:37 Exactly. But then again, liberals and logic go together about as well as oil and water.
1555 2018-08-23 20:52:29 Democrats say they have oil.....

1559 2018-08-23 20:52:06 I agree but surely international agreements breaking up their monopolies as oil, telecoms etc. has been in the past
1560 2018-08-23 20:51:40 You are a con, a grifter, a snake oil salesman.

1568 2018-08-23 20:51:01 I’m wondering how we can really get away from oil & beginning to think a couple of pipelines, one east, one west, might not be so bad. We’re not going to be to live without oil for many years, until we find a substitute to go into plastic! Everything is plastic. Any thoughts?

1575 2018-08-23 20:49:44 Oh now you are talking... I'll vote PMB because he has done what past Government has failed to do. Firstly, diversifying our economy and not being dependent on oil, construction and rehabilitation of major roads across the nation, completion of Abuja light rail etc
1576 2018-08-23 20:49:36 Our mkt cap is too low we are drilling for 2BILLION pounds worth of oil and mkt cap is 60m. That's 3% of the oils worth.

Aaog drilling for 87million pounds worth of oil and got mkt cap of 19m. That's 22% of oils worth.
1577 2018-08-23 20:49:35 Urgh when they're greasy from oil or whatever and they rub their mucky neck on your trousers.
1578 2018-08-23 20:49:31 My dog did this a few weeks ago. I thought for sure he was on his way out. Is it hot where you are? I know she feels poorly. Taking her to the vet is a really good idea. Have you ever given her CBC oil? How old is she. I've send her prayers and healing.Wishing her healing!
1579 2018-08-23 20:49:16 Have you ever heard of government subsidies?  Subsidies to farmers, subsidies to oil companies, subsidies to defense contractors, subsidies to insurance companies, etc. We get the government we deserve. Be real brother.
1580 2018-08-23 20:49:13 I bet that if ever a book is written how the proceeds of oil and gas from the North Sea had been squandered by consecutive British governments a whole lot of British politicians of the past would suddenly be seen in a different light altogether. #corruption

1591 2018-08-23 20:47:54 We are NOT in a petro dollar world! China is buying oil with a gold yuan. The US produces more oil than Saudi Arabia. And WE have more oil than the US and Saudi Arabia combined.

We sell weapons to Saudi Arabia. We can make many, many more. Fuck 'em.
1592 2018-08-23 20:47:52 They are try to do some promotion for corporate companies.. that's why they are doing some stuff against coconut oil.. actually coconut oil is more usefull than others.

1597 2018-08-23 20:47:10 Sure, we are all addicted to them. How is that oil producers fault? Society can’t operate without them. It’s a diesel. It actually does get quite good mileage and it’s only 125hp so not bad for a lead sled.
1598 2018-08-23 20:47:04 Bangin, my muffler fell off this week they said oh that’s 27 bucks but u need 4 new tires and a oil change, 515 bucks, more perfect

1607 2018-08-23 20:45:58 This is serious! I guess it's well, quite the Arabs(especially Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, Qatar and the likes) who were not intoxicated by oil money... They used it to develop their countries with a good standard of living for their citizens...Hmm this is sad
1608 2018-08-23 20:45:54 Oil companies need to pay to protect their facilities.

1619 2018-08-23 20:44:44 The biggest crime in history. Holding back humanity’s progress, keeping us at war with each other while killing the planet. 

Perhaps the drip in disclosure is because they’re trying to figure out how to monetise the tech so they can transition from oil and retain control.

1624 2018-08-23 20:44:31 Went to JiffyLube to get an oil change, and at the register the guy asked me if I needed any other shit done. I panicked. Said yes to everything.

Yeah, the oil crash would have been a wee bit awkward for independence. 

Anyway, I’ll keep working hard see if we can be black without a massive oil paycheck.
1630 2018-08-23 20:43:21 we are selling  more beef to Japan, and the pipeline to send oil to mosr places is being build , and the keystone is no more
1631 2018-08-23 20:43:11 Hopefully Ford taught him something about preventing ship-to-ship oil transfers.
1632 2018-08-23 20:42:58 Absolutely. Oil is a bridge to full renewable self sufficiency. You can be sure the Saudis are looking to the same future. Scotland’s greatest asset? Water, water & more water. #DissolveTheUnion
1633 2018-08-23 20:42:56 Just told that magazine crook that Joe “goes in hot and heavy and deep enough to strike oil.”

1634 2018-08-23 20:42:50 In Ontario we couldn't care less if the oil comes from AB or NL or Nigeria or Venezuela.  We dont want pipelines and we need to phase out fossil fuels ASAP.

1638 2018-08-23 20:42:22 I wonder how much oil will be released from the Arizona from #HurricanLane?
1639 2018-08-23 20:42:19 So for supper I threw a freefrom chicken in roaster with a few carrots and potatoes and a chopped onion and different spices some olive oil and water and....MMmmmm
1640 2018-08-23 20:42:02 We need industries sir, functional once, they should be more oil company presence in Akwa-Ibom.

Work towards achieving those, then I'll give you my unflinching support
1641 2018-08-23 20:42:00 According to the Dallas Morning News, #Texas is producing more oil than ever this year, and experts think the volume will grow so much over the next few years, we will soon surpass the production of several #OPEC countries.

1647 2018-08-23 20:40:19 If you care about anyone's welfare, stop building oil and gas infrastructure that causes global warming. Wildfires will persist as long and you and others in power deny the connections between cause and effect. You're a weak and corrupt leader.
1648 2018-08-23 20:40:17 Hi Tom, which year are your Data from? Im wondering if the stupidly high oil price a while back would change Scotland to the black?
1649 2018-08-23 20:40:11 Hi Randy, we’re sorry to hear this about your dip stick. Please contact our Instant Oil Customer Care team at 1-800-327-8242 or via email at customercare@valvoline.com. They can get more information and provide assistance.

1651 2018-08-23 20:40:08 i thought we didn’t have olive oil earlier so i had to use corn starch and i was afraid they would taste different but they actually turned out really good. i think it made them fluffier
1652 2018-08-23 20:40:02 Gaari and Engine oil
1653 2018-08-23 20:40:00 That’s awesome. Coconut oil is the best
1654 2018-08-23 20:39:53 I get my oil changed like every other week because they also wipe down my windshields so technically I’m saving money on car washes
1655 2018-08-23 20:39:50 Exactly! These are the people who would have literally bought snake oil as a cure for cataracts or something, and learned almost immediately that they'd been duped. This would have been a valuable experience for them, since it might have made them less apt to fall for *big* cons.
1656 2018-08-23 20:39:50 Also cut off from the mines and oil fields they're exploiting? That would be nice
1657 2018-08-23 20:39:40 So, if you want a couple good podcasts to listen to I recommend Slow Burn by Slate and the Midnight Oil podcast. The second season of Slow Burn is about the Clinton impeachment. The hypocrisy of the Republican Party is beyond astounding and disgusting.
1658 2018-08-23 20:39:25 Run his shower water, dim the lights, throw on something nice, grab the body oil and give that deep tissue massage
1659 2018-08-23 20:39:22 She looks scandinavian.All they eat is canned sardines and mackerel. Which is full of mercury.... I want to say to her, coconut oil maybe a pure poison but your food is pure vomit  

South India would have wiped out as they use coconut oil in their food
#Kuchbhi
1660 2018-08-23 20:39:16 Coconut oil is poison? Nah, I still believe coconut oil. It depends what product do you use! #coconutoil
1661 2018-08-23 20:39:01 Oil yeah?
1662 2018-08-23 20:38:59 You just stay in your elitist, hate filled bubble where people don’t think. Just nod to Sir Trump. It will burst and you will be jailed. Btw,
Where was your outrage over the white man that killed his pregnant wife and 2 daughters that he put in oil cans?!? You are an A@@!
1663 2018-08-23 20:38:57 Big oil has enough money to protect itself. They don't need ours.
1664 2018-08-23 20:38:48 My coconut oil
1665 2018-08-23 20:38:45 U should have respect for that amount and currency...even some oil companies don't have it in cash
1666 2018-08-23 20:38:43 Did you know that Grapefruit essential oil contains the enzyme Bromelain, which helps break down cellulite? Mix with some olive oil and sugar for a very effective body scrub! #essentialoils #naturalskincare #naturalremedies #diy
1667 2018-08-23 20:38:40 So all those coconut oil sandwiches I’ve been eating every day weren’t good for me?!?! <hysterical sobbing>
1668 2018-08-23 20:38:38 Murderers are murderers. Being a muslim murderer who kills a random stranger is no worse than a white guy strangling his own children. Or a teen who goes ballistic in a school, and slaughters other teens. Or the parents who gave their son oil of oregano to treat meningitis
1669 2018-08-23 20:38:35 Ugh, my Tupperware of my eggplant caprese leaked all over my lunch box, and when I took it out to put it in the fridge at work/clean up, I got some of the olive oil on me :( also I was really tired hahah
1670 2018-08-23 20:38:35 By the way, my Mother uses organic extra virgin coconut oil. She is 91 years old; lives by herself; gardens regularly; she is very alert. It’s not poison
1671 2018-08-23 20:38:26 Looking at these figures, oil must cost Scotland about £1m a barrel. 
1672 2018-08-23 20:38:22 That’s why you’re not hearing their outrage about Chris Watts who killed his pregnant wife, strangled his 2 daughters and stuffed their bodies in an oil drum. RIP...
1673 2018-08-23 20:38:15 I need to get an oil change but I’m sooooo lazy
1674 2018-08-23 20:38:15 Read something on twitter about using baby oil to take off fake tan ...... had a bath , put baby oil in it, sat in it for a while and then scrubbed and boooommm I’m white again ! What a fucking dream that is ......... Thank me later girls
1675 2018-08-23 20:38:00 Olive oil but y’all need to watch the time
1676 2018-08-23 20:37:57 Fucking hell, 10 years since my GCSEs! My grandad had just died & mam was caring for my gran, who was soon to follow, in Herefordshire... my dad was working on an oil rig that summer... and my brother refused to give me a lift in  Anyway, 8 A*s and 5 A’s. #longwindedhumblebrag
1677 2018-08-23 20:37:50 that sounds right--olive oil is the best.
1678 2018-08-23 20:37:50 @Valvoline I went into your store about 3 months ago and got an oil change. The attendant broke my dip stick, they said they would call for a replacement.. that was too small and I never heard anything back from them! PLEASE HELP!!
1679 2018-08-23 20:37:47 Massive oil reserves, historic shipbuilding and seafaring/fishing industries for interior EU countries. -oh- and 33,000 live births a year. It’s the equivalent of a small coastal state in the US. These economies simply cannot be scaled up for comparison to the US
1680 2018-08-23 20:37:30 Oh god, I hear that —primrose oil helps. So does exercise. The change is fantastic. Wishing you speedy transition!
1681 2018-08-23 20:37:21 I like them hold loads of paint & I really the long handles, use mainly in emulsion & w/b primer/undercoat, not used in oil. But since buying the one brushes I don’t use them as much to be honest
1682 2018-08-23 20:37:12 Plus ask farmers about tariffs and real environmentalists about oil drilling and fracking.  Let’s exploit America again.
1683 2018-08-23 20:37:11 And dumpster was given 20% of the russian oil co rosneft. You don’t think they want something in return?
1684 2018-08-23 20:37:07 A mood. Got my oil changed, car cleaned, hair done, windows open, breeze blowing, Halloween decorations up, coffee brewing, all bills paid early, my mind right 
1685 2018-08-23 20:37:06 I’d recommend anything but garnier, they’re products are trash, I use Cantu which is mostly aimed at kinky/black people hair but shea butter/ coconut oil is good for everyone’s hair so....I don’t think that matters

1689 2018-08-23 20:36:44 Olive oil in the morning? Do tell.

1698 2018-08-23 20:35:54 It can definitely happen over time.. but just use some castor oil and they’ll grow in extremely quick and will build more strength.
1699 2018-08-23 20:35:54 that is an unusual hobby..so Im guessing you sell and buy them for profit.

1703 2018-08-23 20:35:44 and the new cars even give you hints when you need an oil change
1704 2018-08-23 20:35:33 Yeah you’d prefer the handouts only go to the 1% and oil companies. You know, the truly needy.
1705 2018-08-23 20:35:22 Like when your dad said “Ellie I told you check the oil a week ago”
1706 2018-08-23 20:35:08 I need some organic castor oil.
1707 2018-08-23 20:35:04 Putin and Russian oligarchs funding more conservative reactionaries? better watch out, Canada. These people are Dunning-Krugers and tend to believe anything snake oil salesmen tell them. Might have another western democracy destabilized if you ain't careful.
1708 2018-08-23 20:35:02 The Trump Administration has been critical of OPEC, arguing a lack of #oil production could slow U.S. economic growth. Do you agree?
1709 2018-08-23 20:34:58 I just realised my way of being supportive is sending my friends a motivational meme with the caption, "Miss apply all of this to your life with coconut oil liberally." #INeedToDoBetter #SorryNotSorry
1710 2018-08-23 20:34:53 Big mess for @GoTransAm series leader Ernie Francis Jr. on Thursday @roadamerica. Wrecked in oil; car's a mess. Opens door for local guy Lawrence Loshak to make up big ground in championship.
1711 2018-08-23 20:34:32 I just love changing my oil every month 
1712 2018-08-23 20:34:24 Coconut oil is good for us. There are some big financial interests involved in lying and telling us that it is bad for us.
1713 2018-08-23 20:34:23 have any of y’all tried cbd/oil for anxiety?? if so dm me :)
1714 2018-08-23 20:34:12 Ah, but it’s still Jo Malone prices, which I imagine Aldi is not... may have to treat myself to some bath oil though, as Aldi appears to not have copied that (and I’ll have just moved house, so I’ll really deserve it!)
1715 2018-08-23 20:34:08 Harper got rid of it to get more rail for oil farmers lost a bumper crop because they could not get it to market Conservatives did this to us why vote for them @CBCPolitics @AndrewScheer @PierrePoilievre #CPClowns

1717 2018-08-23 20:34:03 @HomesenseHelp brought some body oil from one of your stores, got home and got it out the pack only to find it’s nearly half gone?!
1718 2018-08-23 20:34:03 Real proof of the fire? – 
I’m no expert BUT is it really really sure, the “ping think”? What do you think about the oil carpet of the alleged barge - first days of Search-Gulf of Thailand? AND: THERE were military maneuvers?
1719 2018-08-23 20:33:49 Climate change shit has me straight up near suicidal. I haven't felt this level of anxiety in ages. Fuck sakes. Maybe oil execs deserve to choke and die in a polluted hellscape but the rest of us don't.

1724 2018-08-23 20:33:10 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.

1726 2018-08-23 20:32:56 Keep drinking that snake oil. I am willing to work with people from different backgrounds. Do you need help with tutoring? Job skills? What do you need from me? I know of churches that give job training for free.
1727 2018-08-23 20:32:24 Why would he?
Trudeau doesn't want oil.
Notley doesn't want oil. 
Horgan doesn't want oil. 
If all the major players don't want oil there will be NO pipeline or investment in petroleum resources in Alberta or Sask.
1728 2018-08-23 20:32:12 Awesome, I definitely would appreciate it.    Plan for this weekend is find an oil leak, check my cat since it's throwing an engine light code, and if time.... delete the intake resonator and build a clear acrylic airflow director to funnel air to the short ram intake

1743 2018-08-23 20:30:19 actually oil is quite slippy so most of the wind will just glide over it unaffected- its one of the #majorbenefitsofoilovercoal
1744 2018-08-23 20:30:14 Coconut is good source of mineral and so is it's oil.
1745 2018-08-23 20:30:13 To give a comparison, 0.5% a year GDP hit is much the same as that estimated to be caused by an oil price rise of 40%. In the last two years the oil price has doubled. Has anyone complained about the c. 1% GDP hit this entails?
1746 2018-08-23 20:30:09 Our California beaches are worth more than the oil fields of Saudi Arabia!!!
1747 2018-08-23 20:30:07 Never mind, I read it and I already knew that haha 

Most of my cooking is oil free or uses coconut oil cooking spray (so like a barely appreciable amount of oil) so I don’t mind occasional saturated fat. I guess I just didn’t realize how high it is in comparison to other oils 
1748 2018-08-23 20:30:03 What did you do with the old oil and coolant? Cuz if you didn’t pour them on a tree stump out back, then you lying

1755 2018-08-23 20:29:12 It seems as though they're good. There are a lot of guys that do well working 2 weeks off/on for the oil companies.
1756 2018-08-23 20:28:41 Nathan Cullen, get a real job or you are just promoting Saudi Arabian oil.
1757 2018-08-23 20:28:31 This is like, me now, but with CBD oil. Almost the same.

1765 2018-08-23 20:27:22 We don't disagree on that. Industrially processed food is the real poison, but that doesn't make the point about coconut oil less valid.

1779 2018-08-23 20:25:21 Yooo I hate my car rn. Broken oil pan new gasket new radiator hose new radiator fan and the frame for the radiator to hold it up all fucked up. Can I just shout out Texas for having fucked up roads and making me bottom out my car 
1780 2018-08-23 20:25:21 Oklahoma is truly vile, yes, but they don't have the gall to steal a hockey team from Minnesota. Nor are they a shining beacon of economic success due to oil but credited to ass backwards conservatism that inspires so many others to attempt to follow their lead and ruin America.
1781 2018-08-23 20:25:15 Just open up the computer case, pour this snake oil all over the RAM chips, and your computer will have 10 times the memory!  :D  *snicker*

1783 2018-08-23 20:25:08 Keep your shit with you. 
And tell that Harvard professor he should come to our  government primary school to learn the usage of coconut oil.
1784 2018-08-23 20:24:59 Hope this isnt going to be another BB mr sanderson,no news is never good news and why havent you started the kim yet,if the portland is going to be proved commercial doesnt that mean you have to produce oil and 100 barrels a week is shit
1785 2018-08-23 20:24:56 Need I remind you that Republicans are now in charge?
By the way, domestic oil production nearly doubled during Obama's presidency.

1787 2018-08-23 20:24:41 Lavender oil - I swear by it! A dab on your pillow, a few deep breaths - much better than a chill pill! x
1788 2018-08-23 20:24:30 I see! The mags have lost all critical faculties when it comes to assessing anything. Thank goodness the resisters still have their wits about them. I heard some magas interviewed on the radio this morning. No change. Trump is still their man. The original snake oil salesman.
1789 2018-08-23 20:24:23 Gave my girl $60 for an oil change she spent it on sushi then said for me to give her another $60 lmaooo nigga WHAT??!
1790 2018-08-23 20:24:23 It amazes me that people who work for forest destroying companies and palm oil developers are following conservation and wildife groups.
1791 2018-08-23 20:24:14 You missed the best part of making great popcorn!  The coconut oil is the real secret ingredient to popcorn. By itself coconut oil makes great popcorn.  I'll try your suggestions too!
1792 2018-08-23 20:24:08 We would be much more strong if it wasn’t for your energy policies. You have made many mistakes and now it’s time to try and reverse them. We need pipelines. Our backbone is oil and gas.  Time to get real
1793 2018-08-23 20:23:56 @MarbrinFarm wow guys congrats! It was so great meeting you and now we have an award winning olive oil that made it home in the suitcase!
1794 2018-08-23 20:23:46 @segalink Sir
U are truly DISTINGUISHED sir. God has blessed you with a Golden heart. Ur simplicity and maturity never ceases to amaze me. God replenish U continually. Ur head will lack oil. 'lakaye yin o ni gbe'
1795 2018-08-23 20:23:27 that is unusual....how many pairs do you own and are they all one size?
1796 2018-08-23 20:23:26 Dysfunction--including political chaos but also fistfights, duels, farm animals, and caning-- has been the norm in Congress for most of U.S. history.

But between the oil and subprime mortgage crises, it seemed less dysfunctional...

1800 2018-08-23 20:23:06 That’s impossible, whites own all the land and wealth in South Africa, they live by the EFF and ANC dream owning all the land back at home. They have diamonds gas oil copper gold....
1801 2018-08-23 20:23:06 Over dependence on oil has killed Nigeria. May God save us to understand that.
1802 2018-08-23 20:22:58 So you like high oil prices?
1803 2018-08-23 20:22:42 Oil/gas pipe makes perfect sense, bullshitting people that "clean" coal is coming back for votes is wrong & I genuinely feel sorry for the people being conned
1804 2018-08-23 20:22:39 #FakeNews

the oil companies don't mention "climate change"

that is unprofessional and unethical editorializing by CBS "News"

par for the course
1805 2018-08-23 20:22:36 I actually advise my clients to take a break at least every 3/4 months. And also to use Jamaican castor oil on their lashes while on the break. Natural lashes are still so important, but most “lash techs” are too money hungry to give a damn.
1806 2018-08-23 20:22:33 What good is diplomacy with a country that beheads its female dissidents? But for oil money, Saudi Arabia is indistinguishable from shitholes like Afghanistan.
1807 2018-08-23 20:22:15 For slippery floors mostly their boots are oil resistant. Feet protection maybe etc
1808 2018-08-23 20:22:05 Got my castor oil and witch hazel (cruelty free btw) in the mail and I’m happy
1809 2018-08-23 20:22:01 hey does anyone of you have any experience with cbd oil products? i'm mostly interested in its anxiety relieving properties and was curious if it actually works at all
1810 2018-08-23 20:21:58 Go out and get some oil to throw on there
1811 2018-08-23 20:21:57 you think Say you be sharp guy. Ade stay Abossey Okai. Where is the estate? Only metal and oil sorrrrr.
1812 2018-08-23 20:21:57 Auch. Reminds me of the time I used to oil paint and I forgot the brush had too much petroleum in it so it dropped and the paint parted like a biblical mofo.
1813 2018-08-23 20:21:56 Lowering income tax while at the same time (and in complete secrecy) sharply raising the far more important royalty (on revenues) and also widening the amount of oil output covered by the royalty. That’s also important to investors.
1814 2018-08-23 20:21:52 2/ Leading clinicians in organisations like the NHS and American Heart Association hold the view that the kind of saturated fat found in coconut oil is a contributing factor in CHD and should be replaced with polyunsaturated fats to lower one's risk of cardiovascular disease.
1815 2018-08-23 20:21:47 And the oil & gas companies are doing that more and more to stifle free speech.
1816 2018-08-23 20:21:46 Convos in Econ:
Teach: I had back pain so I tried medical marijuana 
Kids: try this type of oil! 
Teach: I've actually found opiates to be...y'know I just need morphine sometimes 
All of us: SCREAMING
1817 2018-08-23 20:21:44 It's crystal clear that's what it is. It's about supreme court domination, it's about getting their tax cuts to their big donors, it's about money to their specific military contractors, it's about protecting the oil industry and keeping that money coming. Power and control.
1818 2018-08-23 20:21:37 I hope you'll be applying baby oil all over to counteract the a/c, wouldn't want to miss that lovely greasy sheen
1819 2018-08-23 20:21:34 My son came home i gave him a bath, hit em with that coconut oil...he was sleep at his table with a half eating chicken finger
1820 2018-08-23 20:21:12 No such luck: “Undoctored potatoes are healthy, says Mueller: They supply a good mix of nutrients. It’s when people deep-fry them in oil or smother them in butter, sour cream, or salt that spuds turn into nutritional duds.” Undoctored potatoes?! Where’s the fun in that?
1821 2018-08-23 20:21:02 thank!

if you can get unrefined virgin coconut oil
1822 2018-08-23 20:21:00 VZ could grow production massively if they ever get it together. They have Canada’s oil sands in a tropical climate!

1829 2018-08-23 20:20:20 Wow. This is awesome. Is it oil?
1830 2018-08-23 20:20:19 Madam will you resign from CBN to work in a microfinance Bank because you want new challenges or will you leave shell to work with okpekpe oil and gas?
1831 2018-08-23 20:20:17 Trader Joe's is a treasure trove of goodies! I'm highly addicted to and recommend their olive oil popcorn. Secret Flying is great for daily flight deals to everywhere. If you don't need to look cute on long flight, put on and leave on a hydrating mask that dries clear.
1832 2018-08-23 20:20:09 Until the rest of the country begins to starve at which point they'll be all shoulders wondering why there is a food shortage.
1833 2018-08-23 20:19:44 I kinda of thought that. Considering the price of oil, gas is about 25 cents per litre over priced.
1834 2018-08-23 20:19:34 Coconut oil is an exception, is good worldwide, I think.
1835 2018-08-23 20:19:29 Big women discussion

1841 2018-08-23 20:19:00 Anyone know where I can get good cbd oil locally?
1842 2018-08-23 20:18:57 So, if we have to import oil, then why are we exporting any?
1843 2018-08-23 20:18:11 Legend has it they were standard issue on the oil rigs in the old days and if you fell in the North Sea, they could easily be kicked off . 
You’d be struggling in your laces...
1844 2018-08-23 20:18:08 I have coconut "cooking" oil that I rub on my skin. It healed my car accident scars super quickly.
1845 2018-08-23 20:18:03 So I know that the right wing peddles actual snake oil stuff for humans, but I am certain I ran into the first right wing person to peddle snake oil to dogs.
1846 2018-08-23 20:17:59 By that logic, assuming you are an Aberdeen fan, you are contributing greatly to the destruction of the planet by supporting a team who have multiple sponsors in the oil industry including their main sponsor
1847 2018-08-23 20:17:54 Correct, Dash is what Monero will never be: a poorly designed, heavily centralised, uninteresting Bitcoin fork offering ill-conceived “features” that are no different to snake oil.
1848 2018-08-23 20:17:47 Literally none of that is news. We knew that from ONEs own press releases before the presser

Man I hope ONE is paying you cause you do a better job selling ONE than that snake oil salesman Chatri did
1849 2018-08-23 20:17:43 Saudi Arabia is very close allie of USA and provide around 48% of south African follow by Nigeria which am sure who think twice if USA instructions them to stop selling oil in SA.they got powers those people bra.
1850 2018-08-23 20:17:35 1/ The epidemiology of CHD is complex, with multiple causal and mitigatory factors interacting across a wide variety of cultures and geographical locations. None of this alters the chemistry of coconut oil, which is comprised of around 90% saturated fat.

1860 2018-08-23 20:16:04 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
1861 2018-08-23 20:16:03 Well, most of Indians specially from South are known to use coconut oil for cooking and using the same as hair oil, it has done them good only! It's rubbish theory!!
1862 2018-08-23 20:15:46 Far more awful for the country is his ignorance of policies like tariffs. He is gutting the country by listening to snake oil salesmen who couldn't extrapolate an effect if it hit them in the eye.

1865 2018-08-23 20:15:33 Well, number 1 is for the waterfront to be in the same place as it is today. Number 2 would be for it to be not covered with oil. They are both connected. #StopClimateChange #StopPipelines

1877 2018-08-23 20:13:59 Turkey (our NATO frenemies) would have opposed a Kurdish state, and all three factions would have a turbulent time dividing the country's oil resources, but still . . . this plan might have been the least bad option.

1880 2018-08-23 20:13:55 The notional 40% on oil revenue is 10% supplementary charge on oil productions, and then 30% as RFCT. Corporation Tax is allocated for GERS to the companies registered office. Where are those registered offices? 

BP: London

Total: London
Gazprom: London

1883 2018-08-23 20:13:30 They saying coconut oil is poison now. The white man is really after us lol smh
1884 2018-08-23 20:13:28 Glad you were able to enjoy the view before all the oil drilling equipment is brought in.
1885 2018-08-23 20:13:25 What kind of oil did you use?
1886 2018-08-23 20:13:20 In Rome we had Jerusalem Artichokes (fried in olive oil, bilaterally sliced artichokes). Any chance you can talk me thru how to make em or link a recipie. They were a fav when we went on our honeymoon 8.5 yrs ago
1887 2018-08-23 20:13:05 @jeffsessions is blind? Who knew?
1888 2018-08-23 20:13:01 do you frens remember when the mine service was caught, like, taking bribes in the form of meth fueled parties from oil companies
1889 2018-08-23 20:12:59 Wrong. Your desire to drill everywhere with impunity would devastate Colorado, not our economy. We learned our lesson in the 80s and diversified away from oil and gas. Now GF yourselves.
1890 2018-08-23 20:12:51 Russia isn't a big deal, a country full of natural resources(Gas,Oil, Gold). But China is a real threat to USA, the Silk Road project definitely is going to isolate USA. People in China work like Slaves with loooooooow income, the word of Human rights is forbidden.
1891 2018-08-23 20:12:47 They sure don't seem to give a fuck about building oil pipelines through Native Americans' land, or Israel being Israel, orrrrr
1892 2018-08-23 20:12:33 Loving this oil spray I made for myself
1893 2018-08-23 20:12:32 Lol@nominal terms! Go sell the snake oil to someone else. The size of the economy is inconsequential to the average citizen if their capita share is still one of the lowest in the world
1894 2018-08-23 20:12:29 Get my damn braces fixed tone my hair, make up shopping, get a damn oil change and my tires rotated
1895 2018-08-23 20:12:27 Midnight Oil - Blue Sky Mine - 2011 Remaster
1896 2018-08-23 20:12:13 They would rather have 30 new stores in the mall or something. People in this town love spending stupid money on themselves, when gas and oil hit it turned alot of people into millionaires over night, Stc folk would rather drive teslas than help the community
1897 2018-08-23 20:12:03 UAE are Arabs and very close allies of USA they also got oil and provide around 48% of south African oil.when USA impose sanctions have tendencies of dictating to their allies to also drop that country.major SA oil providers are Nigerian and UAE.guess what will happen?
1898 2018-08-23 20:12:00 How? Oil.
1899 2018-08-23 20:11:51 Where does the U.S. stand with oil reserves? Will they not need oil from these countries? Don't shoot yourself in the foot to spite your nose!
1900 2018-08-23 20:11:46 I agree. I was just thinking how painterly it looks, not in the clichéd sense, i.e. well composed, but in the sense that it looks like it was created with brushes and paint (probably oil).
1901 2018-08-23 20:11:30 Little too much water left when I added the oil but it was very good. 
1902 2018-08-23 20:11:20 I keep crushing people's essential oil posts on social media. I like to think it makes a difference.
1903 2018-08-23 20:11:03 Wayy good w salmon!! 
I like to toss it in a tiny bit of coconut oil, season with salt & pepper, then bake that shit  
The tops will get slightly crispy & it’s scrumptious!
1904 2018-08-23 20:10:38 I'm so hurt I have to buy this new tire and  I have an oil change in the am.... 

When I spend money I always feel some type of way if it's not a tangible gain lol
1905 2018-08-23 20:10:37 I dont like how literally every product is a subscription service nowadays. I just want to buy one bottle of olive oil. I dont need you sending me $40 worth of suggested shit every 28 days.
1906 2018-08-23 20:10:34 The oil would, at worst, belong to the country in whose waters it is located
1907 2018-08-23 20:10:31 Me TooCanada could be a free trading dynamo without the MBA real free trade agreement with #USA & #Mexico... An end to #Corporate taxpayers $ an #energyeast pipeline & oil/gas self-sufficiency, smaller #GovernmentCanada has to change.. Loved his plan on getting there

1909 2018-08-23 20:10:21 And, further to the hurting kids thing...the guy in Colorado who killed his entire family? White, middle-class, working guy. Nice house. Adoring wife. Gorgeous children. Hid his babies in an oil tank. There is no punishment severe enough. No hell dark enough.
1910 2018-08-23 20:10:16 so look into that darling if Flynn has limited speech at the moment and tantrums sometimes is the frustration of communicating .PECS system look it up is brilliant.however school will be aware of it ,also try the oil for calm.does he like massage when hes drinking bottle perhps
1911 2018-08-23 20:10:14 Glad ik how to change my own oil but I still pay somebody to do it lol .
1912 2018-08-23 20:10:05 え、君顎あるの？顎ってやっぱりどこかで買うの？僕顎持ってないんだけど。
1913 2018-08-23 20:09:24 To stand idly by and watch an ideologically driven right wing govt continue with its economic incompetence and mismanagement of decades of oil revenues and the Scottish economy as it tears us out of EU is I would suggest sheer madness!
1914 2018-08-23 20:09:13 The government is really starting to crack down on CBD oil. Smh sad
1915 2018-08-23 20:09:13 I really do hope that we passed peak oil and oil gets more expensive and car less numerous, that's certainly something I'd like to see decreasing!
1916 2018-08-23 20:09:12 Changed the oil on Coco today.. and damn it feels nice not having to go drop extra money for someone else to do it 
1917 2018-08-23 20:09:02 Got our oil wants saudi money

1919 2018-08-23 20:08:58 In my experience it's usually Boomers - whose peers in D.C., the oil and coal industry they know were aware of what they were doing to the planet - are the only climate change deniers.
1920 2018-08-23 20:08:55 There's one other, more oblique Ambrose Bierce connection in King in Yellow as well: the near-future dystopian America from Repairer of  Reputations is a dead ringer for the America of Bierce's wickedly funny  "Parenticide Club" collection, most famous for the story Oil of Dog.
1921 2018-08-23 20:08:47 You won’t be taking that. The oil is a U.K. resource. And there’s no evidence whatsoever that Scotland would vote for independence. Jimmy Krankie lost a third of her seats at the last election. See you Jimmy.
1922 2018-08-23 20:08:43 Coconut oil. Unrefined. Cold-pressed. (Not extracted with solvents--that stuff is toxic.)
1923 2018-08-23 20:08:35 This is hard to talk about but I've had this problem lately where every time I'm about to eat a sandwich, like ham and cheese or whatever, a little girl voice pops into my head and sweetly sings, "Do you want to eat a sandwich?????"

So what fixes this CBD or coconut oil?

1927 2018-08-23 20:07:56 Repeat of very successful allegation propogated by the Soya Bean lobby in the 1970's to discredit coconut oil.  The propoganda decimated the coconut oil industry and thrust Soya to the front in vegetable oil business. Wonder who pays the Prof and how much.
1928 2018-08-23 20:07:54 ask them to find one person in this world who has not benefited from "arab money"? For starters, EVERY govt has backing of "oil funding" at some level. Ignorant Racists.

1966 2018-08-23 20:02:59 Good point. But this makes me wonder: what if the downfall of democracy can be traced to the moment the government started trying to outlaw con artists? The electorate was far more skeptical back when they had to evaluate their snake oil purchases for themselves.

2059 2018-08-23 19:51:25 Pushing the false narrative that oil & gas production causes wild fires. Mike has no shame.

Get your head out of your junk food eating ass you morons.

2067 2018-08-23 19:50:06 Pussy body oil smells amazing 
2068 2018-08-23 19:49:58 SO FREAKING MUCH! And not just with anxiety! But with my hip and back problems, my migraines, my endometriosis, I could go on and on! I lost my oil and have been flipping out about it. It’s life changing!!
2069 2018-08-23 19:49:44 If you know me you know I suffer during nyc summers, so I'm very particular about the fabrics I wear.... I'm considering dipping the entire sjirt in coconut oil so it can all be the same shade 
2070 2018-08-23 19:49:17 みんなオイルが好きだよね⁇あん⁇嫌い⁇嫌いとか言うならオイル使われてる食品も製品も食べるなよ使うなよwwwwww? ガソリンもオイルだよ⁇www 車も乗るなよwww? 野菜だけ食ってろよwwww ベジタリアンテラワロスwwwwwww

2072 2018-08-23 19:49:07 I love my coconut oil...
Does my whole body good!
From the roofer to the tooter
2073 2018-08-23 19:48:51 I was going to go all out you know. Six kinds of cheese. Four kinds of crackers. Grapes. Chutney. Olives. Salted butter. Bread. Oil and vinegar. These lot are ungrateful
2074 2018-08-23 19:48:49 How many RTs do I need for you to send me the whole line? (The lotion the perfume the bath milk and the oil)
2075 2018-08-23 19:48:43 Behnchod Harvard should call this pure poison, not coconut oil.
2076 2018-08-23 19:48:39 I seen this man at the gas station in a NICE ass blacked out VW meanwhile I’m looking distressed and clueless tryna refill the oil in my stupid ass VW lmfao. Made me feel so small.
2077 2018-08-23 19:48:32 That’s right! “The #solar industry employs more Americans than coal, oil and gas energy generation combined.” - @SEIA
2078 2018-08-23 19:48:22 hmmm... all I see is high Glycemic fries (breaks down as sugar) fried in canola/soybean oil which is trans fats (stiffens cell walls), High Glycemic fruit (apples- better than fries tho), gluten-covered (inflammatory) glued together chicken pieces, and low-fat (aka high GI) milk
2079 2018-08-23 19:48:08 K so how does dish soap wash oil off of a duck in seconds but I’m over here scrubbin a greasy pan for hours I just wanna know
2080 2018-08-23 19:48:08 Hey, Taylor, what is the oil revenue? Where is it calculated and where paid? Tonnes at the Wellhead, or Tonnes landed, or exported? Sorry I don't know, but keen to learn.
2081 2018-08-23 19:48:01 Mister better use that coconut oil I gave him
2082 2018-08-23 19:47:58 I’ve actually made my own in the past. Shea butter, coconut oil and beeswax. Added a touch of peppermint essential oil.
2083 2018-08-23 19:47:53 And contributed to unprecedented success of opposition at the same time. Weighing the two, you get less than a passing grade.
2084 2018-08-23 19:47:53 Coconut oil changes my life wow i love my hair rn
2085 2018-08-23 19:47:50 Lolz @ all the people losing their minds about the coconut oil report. It happened with eggs years ago and I still lay them daily with NO negative side effects . Would not suggest laying a coconut, but you do you, I will never judge
2086 2018-08-23 19:47:05 Got my oil changed! Whoot

2097 2018-08-23 19:45:07 Like Iraq and Libya, Syria is being attacked because they deigned to sell their oil for a currency other than the U.S.dollar. The U.S. wages war to protect Petro-dollar hegemony and control of resources as well as The Greater Israel Project. It has NOTHING to do with people.
2098 2018-08-23 19:45:06 But shutting our central bank and the McCrone report did happen in our recent history shafting Scotland big time....we had slum like areas inspite of the fact we had oil UK gov squandered it
2099 2018-08-23 19:44:59 Olive oil is bad to cook with because of its low smoke point.  Use it for salad dressings. Not sure what’s Canola oil or what veggies are used to make vegetable oil. You know what coconut oil is,however, I use grapeseed oil.
2100 2018-08-23 19:44:57 coconut oil moves fings along nicely xx
2101 2018-08-23 19:44:57 What a delusional blowhard the #RacistInChief  is.

#DelusionalDonnie #Illegitimate #PutinsPuppet #FakeWH
2102 2018-08-23 19:44:49 So apparently coconut oil is now ‘pure poison’!  Is it any wonder people have no idea what they should / shouldn’t eat. Such dramatic headlines are not helpful  #coconutoil
2103 2018-08-23 19:44:39 I feel compelled to do so, because I’m against all forms of oppression. I won’t eat Californian almonds, I avoid palm oil as much as possible. I won’t purchase from certain companies either.
2104 2018-08-23 19:44:38 Two in one, hello! But still get some oil on the side lol
2105 2018-08-23 19:44:24 @Saudi_Aramco  postponing #IPO for now was predictable in light of purchasing big stake in @SABIC.  Too complex to handle both for company as well as fot #markets. Always was sceptical on IPO in terms of time-frame and #valuation. Way too aggressive. #OOTT #oil
2106 2018-08-23 19:44:24 try mixing coconut oil, vitamin e oil, castor oil and you can even do like en egg or honey and do a hair mask. i use to do that all the time and it made my hair so shiny and feel so good

2108 2018-08-23 19:44:08 i cant believe my bot like the oil meme
2109 2018-08-23 19:44:06 I still don't understand why we give the oil and gas industry billions of dollars in subsidies but a fraction of that for women's health is a bridge too far.
2110 2018-08-23 19:44:06 when you get a car ALWAYS check your oil! That’s how people ruin their engine
2111 2018-08-23 19:43:54 Her speech about coconut oil is in German which is my mother tongue and after watching the whole speech I can tell that she doesn't give any arguments that are really convincing if you know the pros, and she avoids answering the audience's questions by giving only general answers
2112 2018-08-23 19:43:45 Coconut oil is all vegetable fat. Whatever vitamins or minerals it has can't make up for the fact that it is ALL fat.
2113 2018-08-23 19:43:42 I think Coconut oil is great. But it's not some super food "cure-all" like some make it out to be. I don't use it in cooking much, but rather baking. Otherwise it's too much of a sweet taste.

2116 2018-08-23 19:43:35 Going to get more practice on the village hall over the weekend. Looking to upgrade to a ASHP in place of existing 16 year old oil boiler. Mainly UFH in screed.
2117 2018-08-23 19:43:21 Another Democratic stupid statement, Obama spent millions
Going to Cuba alone, Obama also spent millions going to a gay retreat
Remember that. OBAMA gave billions to the enemy. That's a trader
Obama let the oil leak out into the ocean for 87days that's a Terrorist
2118 2018-08-23 19:43:14 I'd like to get a portable generator but that idea was nixed. We're rural here so septic tank and an oil tank instead of gas means we might get a few weeks grace if the electricity goes down. I have a few solar things for fun, they might be marginally useful if it's sunny enough.
2119 2018-08-23 19:43:12 when you make matumbo, the oil sticks together before you boil it again, tafakari

2121 2018-08-23 19:43:02 He cheated on his first two ex-wives, proven. And well, turns out there IS someone who drank deeply enough of the snake oil to believe he didn't have any affairs after marrying an illegal alien.
2122 2018-08-23 19:42:54 $5 OFF Blue Roots Oil Cartridges!
2123 2018-08-23 19:42:46 Also, sorry for jumping in on your tweet. We're coconut oil users, just in great moderation, unless we're using it topically for homemade lotions and scrubs, and ointments for horse injuries or for use on their hooves, etc.  I'm a huge believer in coconut oil.

A lot of fellows reply to or comment on my comments with the beginning of "Agree BUT ...". Most of the times, they don't attach a chart to back up their reasoning of "BUT". This situation leaves me no choices BUT just ignore the messages. I am sorry BUT...
2128 2018-08-23 19:42:25 Maybe @chrislhayes means it's "absolutely nuts", given that Mrs. Wipe-It-With-A-Cloth Clinton skated.
2129 2018-08-23 19:42:19 Paid about $5000 in taxes this year. Thats my money and they are wasting it on oil wars for their pockets? Military parades while vets sleep under freeways? Kidnapped children holed up in old walmarts? We need an IRS Boycott if this keeps on
2130 2018-08-23 19:42:17 Oil would be one example. And you meant to write “who’s” (contraction of “who is”) not “whose” (possessive pronoun/determiner).
2131 2018-08-23 19:42:11 You pervert the gospel to sell self-help manuals and snake oil. May you be known by your fruits and judged righteously for your sins.

2139 2018-08-23 19:41:41 It’s one the most lucrative fantasy franchise in human history and it’s mandatory for all Muslims across generations . They even allow one to expiate the “sins” of another by proxy . They also have snake oil: zamzam water !

2141 2018-08-23 19:41:32 Pure kannadiga and never have we used coconut oil for cooking at our home.. though most of my friends from kerala swear by coconut oil.
2142 2018-08-23 19:41:29 To plump up lips, apply peppermint oil.
2143 2018-08-23 19:40:32 The unassuming void of that feeling when need new oil change

2147 2018-08-23 19:40:10 about to start getting my oil changed at my dealership..
2148 2018-08-23 19:40:08 Some goon at the AP wrote up an article that it's being pushed by BIG OIL and "ha ha climate change deniers." As if the Gulf of Mexico never posed a threat to development and civilization. So tired of these small minds.
2149 2018-08-23 19:40:03 Since I’ve started working in Huckleberrys. I’ve sprained my ankle, burned my hand on hot oil about 6 times,scalded my hand with hot water and I’ve only been there for 6 months  #disaster
2150 2018-08-23 19:40:01 I’ve always thought we should hoard our domestic resources and use up the foreign resources while they’re cheap.  Then we will be the only ones left with oil when it runs out.
2151 2018-08-23 19:40:00 I am always astonished at the vibrancy of so many of the oil paintings of that era.
2152 2018-08-23 19:39:55 This had made my ovaries explode and clear my face of any excess oil 
2153 2018-08-23 19:39:53 Coconut oil is ‘pure poison’!!!!!
WTH....
How the fuck you gonna spew that mess?

2154 2018-08-23 19:39:48 The dealership keeps giving me a free oil change for doing this lil survey so guess what imma do?

2158 2018-08-23 19:39:14 MY HEAD GET OIL !!!
2159 2018-08-23 19:39:12 When you come in for a massage and tell me to avoid your head bc you don't want oil in your hair..

A)  Don't ask for neck focus
B)  All I hear is "I'd rather look better than feel better"
C)  Plan your massage so that you can shower after & then you get the full experience.
2160 2018-08-23 19:39:02 New govt. has wasted one week but haven't achieved any feat, yet. We the nation are waiting anxiously for low prices of oil and electricity. Lets see when the govt. will start the work, positively.

2165 2018-08-23 19:38:19 3 main things that caused the most stress in my life ranked: 
1) my excessive inestinal gas reflex
2) cis~hetero~men who have come into my life to show how much they can drain my energy and leave without a word
3) the government and today’s social economy 
2166 2018-08-23 19:38:02 And burning peat and whale oil.

2169 2018-08-23 19:37:24 Sugarcane and palm oil
2170 2018-08-23 19:37:24 Agreed - my hair prefers water based  products and castor oil. Castor doesn't make me break out like coconut oil and olive oil used to, so I use that now.
2171 2018-08-23 19:37:20 It's cheap, it's dirty (old folks think anything dirty in the air is good for the country) endless supply, levels mountains, endless grazing land, shorten lives and almost as good as oil.  Dirty coal is back, becasue Trump says so.
2172 2018-08-23 19:37:17 I call Brexiteers "Brexiteers". I call separatist nationalists like you "idiots".
There are NO figures on exports or oil & gas in GERS. If I'm wrong on that then you'll manage to show otherwise won't you fool?  Are you still at primary school because you really don't know much?
2173 2018-08-23 19:37:13 oil: changed
2174 2018-08-23 19:37:02 First on the list- Imhof. Jerk. Oklahoma sold its soul to oil about 1889.
2175 2018-08-23 19:36:53 Voted for mustard oil..but I used ghee extensively and olive oil for salad dressings/sea fish preparations
2176 2018-08-23 19:36:24 To be fair, indians also eat mustard oil and thats not supposed to be eaten either.
2177 2018-08-23 19:36:19 Why not just get Shell Oil or The Mutual of Omaha to sponsor it like they did back in the 60’s and 70’s...because it’s going to be just that cheesy?
2178 2018-08-23 19:36:18 Your smoking oil foo? That’s no good for you
2179 2018-08-23 19:36:12 True! Esp Keralites use cocnut oil for cooking...
2180 2018-08-23 19:36:11 I pre-pooed my hair overnight with some extra Virgin olive oil and my hair is literally so soft wowza
2181 2018-08-23 19:36:06 I think there's only coal where Big Oil's heart should be.    The voters need to look in their hearts and vote for candidates running on pro-environment platforms  (Or Pro-CreationCare for climate deniers) .

2189 2018-08-23 19:35:02 My mom hasn't had an oil change for her car in literally probably a year and one of her tires was going flat. So rather than fix those problems  she went and got a new fucking car.

2193 2018-08-23 19:34:39 There is a consensus amongst the people no doubt.  The politicians have access to information as to why they won't act faster. To end oil right now would bring worldwide economic collapse... The transition will take another two decades or more....
2194 2018-08-23 19:34:33 Like someone commented upstream: "Roger Rabbit" (yes, that one) is maybe the best explanation.

It was about cars (/oil). Also, yes, racism, there's hardly any aspect of US culture that isn't affected by racism. But streetcars were put out of business for car/oil profits.

2201 2018-08-23 19:33:31 Basic capitalist economics, which are delusional and un-predictive, with experts surprised by every crash and confused by the constant, daily influx of facts that contradict their expectations. Capitalist economics are snake oil, a practiced ideological mysticism.

2217 2018-08-23 19:32:14 Density and buoyancy is gravity. The oil always floats to the top because it is less dense than water. Oil and water don't mix because water molecules are more attracted to each other than to oil molecules.  Oil has a lower density than water, so it always floats on top.

2222 2018-08-23 19:31:26 I figured out the fastest way for the US to get to Mars. Say that it has a huge supply of oil under its surface. We’d be there next week.
2223 2018-08-23 19:31:14 That would be silly as major industries like banking, manufacturing, media and retail are all in private hands. It's just the usual Venezuelan oil boom & bust story we've seen for decades. Maybe they should have tried Socialism after all.

2242 2018-08-23 19:29:20 Corporation tax is allocated to companies registered office. Which for a lot of large companies is London. So, the profits made across the UK end up being allocated to just London. No real surprise that London is so far ahead of everywhere else. Also, 30% RFCT on oil companies.
2243 2018-08-23 19:29:19 i don’t see how people actually use coconut oil on their hair and skin

2283 2018-08-23 19:24:38 Yes, but given the horror oil prices inherited in 2015 we’re doing pretty good. Also full-time job growth is up considerably. that oil patch jobs that used to require 100 people are now more efficient and require 4 is not the fault of a government, that’s technology

2291 2018-08-23 19:24:07 Canola oil is best for daily use. it's light, very very low on trans fat and saturated to a great degree. Jeevo canola is a good brand that has nice offers as well.

2296 2018-08-23 19:23:24 Amazing! When they come out with oil free energy systems, there is always someone in gov't that shuts it down! Does the minister have ties with the oil industry?
2297 2018-08-23 19:23:03 climate change is bigger than economy, justice, and freedom combined. but the unintended benefits of putting oil companies out of business would be nice. the Trump milieu would have no reason to exist without oil companies to prop up.
2298 2018-08-23 19:23:03 Perhaps, but in the same concentrations, processed in the same way? The fact is, there's a strong correlation between saturated fat and CHD, and coconut oil contains twice the amount of TFA as lard...

2325 2018-08-23 19:20:50 Yeah I don't like the idea of sending the Red Chinese all the oil, and I still prefer Trucks and Tankers, as they will lose less in an accident then a single pipe.

2327 2018-08-23 19:20:38 I have not done any work on oil prices v ISM, but I intuitively agree.
2328 2018-08-23 19:20:32 Things I learned today: coconut oil is actually really unhealthy and Noah cintenio apparently has a sex tape
2329 2018-08-23 19:20:30 Used all ke ?? And the headache no still gree vamos?  
Toh. You need to apply olive oil then.
2330 2018-08-23 19:20:20 A 94-year old Nazi was hauled back to Germany this week for a crime committed 70 years ago. Trump's crimes date back to my last oil change. He is still culpable.
2331 2018-08-23 19:20:17 @TomFrankly Hey what's up, I listen in your podcast that you recommend coco oil, what do you think about that reasearch of that medic of Harvard?
2332 2018-08-23 19:20:12 Climate Change? Time to listen to this he experts and that doesn’t mean oil companies! Do NOT support Kavanaugh! See the documentation in full before deciding on@my grandchildren’s fate!!!
2333 2018-08-23 19:19:59 There are no small oil rich nations with a deficit unless they're mismanaged and fleeced by their neighbouring country, you're both welcome for the info 
2334 2018-08-23 19:19:49 Oil from $26 to $74 and still in uptrend, irrespective of short term corrections, would disagree with you
2335 2018-08-23 19:19:47 LOL w/ shade for canola oil. How dare they??
2336 2018-08-23 19:19:40 Acrylic is a lot of fun! And yeah, it is easier to use than oil :c
2337 2018-08-23 19:19:36 Africa Oil men den försvann snabbt ut igen. Sen tog det ett par år innan jag köpte något nästa gång.
2338 2018-08-23 19:19:35 Delicious. I saute mine with rosemary, olive oil, and usually a sweet onion. I'll add crushed cashews if I'm feeling fancy.
2339 2018-08-23 19:19:26 Earlier stuff by Midnight Oil comes to mind.
2340 2018-08-23 19:19:25 Something else along these lines too: anyone in Washington who knows about the Saudi gov't role in 9/11, keeps their mouth shut about it, & continues to vote to arm them has committed treason, not even for wrong-headed ideology but for cold, hard cash from Saudis or big oil.

2343 2018-08-23 19:19:05 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
2344 2018-08-23 19:19:00 Butter is not bad either (neither is coconut oil as far as we know.. it is saturated fat, not some sort of toxin)
2345 2018-08-23 19:18:59 Every time I come into Walmart for an oil change I get mad cuz they act slow af. Idk why I keep coming back 
2346 2018-08-23 19:18:58 I’m a nude explicit model but there’s many tease videos you can do.For example:Lotion or oil tease,soapy shower,wax tease,glitter,etc
2347 2018-08-23 19:18:51 Texas. One kg. meat = two kg. oil.
2348 2018-08-23 19:18:50 #wegotogetherlike oil and water
2349 2018-08-23 19:18:42 We check oil in all mowers before leaving shop every day.  Got to a large apartment complex 30 minutes in to mow and a guy comes over with oil all over the machine saying theres an oil leak.  I tightened the dipstick cap.
2350 2018-08-23 19:18:29 Totally agree. Oil sands are not environmentally friendly. The Petroteq technology creates a habitable environment for wildlife. What's not to like.
2351 2018-08-23 19:18:25 I think in the future, oil will be the thick goup that’s the root of most evil; and the sun will be the new superpower.
2352 2018-08-23 19:18:03 Argan oil, then some eco styler gel. Use just a thin layer of oil though, because it's thick and it can break down the gel
2353 2018-08-23 19:18:01 Sure, some do. But what about vehicle tax and mineral oil tax breaks? I am so very sceptical of these 'best' lists, no matter the subject, no matter the country.
2354 2018-08-23 19:17:49 I’m always lending you my oil, and I still haven’t got my pump back!
2355 2018-08-23 19:17:48 This weekend, try oil pulling while wearing a obsidian bracelet.
2356 2018-08-23 19:17:40 Simple answer,  big oil pays to protect their jewels.
2357 2018-08-23 19:17:38 Coastal barrier for Texas is not just supported by "big oil" but I guess the Occupy Wall Street mentality around here is too strong for weak minds.
2358 2018-08-23 19:17:29 Of course it all boils down to energy, and maybe their computer model is obsolete but I heard it had been updated regularly to account for computer and statistical models progress...
You can't deny we passed oil production peak, or that sand is becoming scarce?
2359 2018-08-23 19:17:27 Someone recommended CBD oil for my husband's anxiety, we'd love to give it a go.
2360 2018-08-23 19:17:25 Thawed a pork loin out overnight and just put it in the oven with lots of onion, garlic, olive oil and herbs and spices. Not roasted anything in months. Lovely and cool and sodden out, with a nice bit of pinkpeach sunset to the south.
2361 2018-08-23 19:17:21 It's disgusting how @FoxNews and Trump have politicized this tragedy. I mean, we have a guy out here who works for Anadarko who just killed his wife & two daughters and I don't hear Trump going after the oil industry.
2362 2018-08-23 19:17:12 Some Russian propaganda is a welcome addition to the monotonous Trans-Atlantic propaganda: What's new for S70 E200? Nothing! NATO & Israel is Good, Russia is Bad, Arab countries with Oil need Liberation from Tyrants or Terrorists. #Aufstehen #Querfront #Linke #Gruene #AfD

2365 2018-08-23 19:16:58 Every murder is senseless. You want to make her death a political talking point. 1 man killed his two daughters and put them in an oil barrel, why aren’t you talking about that?
2366 2018-08-23 19:16:58 Dems have time to address important things like big oil contributions — since we don’t have to be worrying about our entire financial team going to jail.

2376 2018-08-23 19:16:05 I’m still surprised my colleagues don’t know what palm oil is

2383 2018-08-23 19:14:33 Yes I am better. Just got a hot head oil massage and I'm ready to crash !
How has your day been ?
2384 2018-08-23 19:14:20 Paying someone else to change your oil for you is NOT a power move
2385 2018-08-23 19:14:15 Which unity are you talkin 'bout? The same unity tha made 'em kill 33,000 #Igbos in '66? Or the unity tha made Gowon Trash the 'Aburi Accord'?

2394 2018-08-23 19:12:26 Wow. Way to be petty. Sir you disgrace the office that you hold! Please step aside for a TRUE conservative. I’ve been quoting this scripture a lot lately. Smh “Dead flies make a perfumer's oil stink, so a little foolishness is weightier than wisdom and honor.”
Ecc. 10:1 NASB

It was thought in a world without limit. Our oil resources are.
And the enormous tensions that it generates will soon burst forth.

2403 2018-08-23 19:11:50 What about dangerous oil spills and pollution?
2404 2018-08-23 19:11:47 We should be keeping every drop of oil for ourselves. Energy independence not energy profits.

Looking to discover oil? 
2422 2018-08-23 19:10:22 Here's the thing: states may 'bounce back'. But people suffer. Brexit is already causing distress. But a generation of distress is to follow. No oil money this time. And there's NO charity in international business & politics.

2433 2018-08-23 19:09:25 Doesn't automagically make it "pure poison" either. Hyperbolic headlines are stupid. Yes, we know coconut oil is fat. So what? Exercise and have in moderation. Fat from red meat is associated with risk of heart disease, type II diabetes and stroke.
2434 2018-08-23 19:09:25 Why does it take 30 minutes just to change oil and why is it $40. Is also appreciate it if the receptionist wasn’t talking with an attitude.

2436 2018-08-23 19:09:14 last night I walked into my local head shop to see if they had any CBD oil to help me sleep (they did), and when he was ringing me up the cashier was like "we've also got THC, but its behind the counter" with a little smirk. NEW YORK, STILL GOT IT!
2437 2018-08-23 19:09:08 Losing that argument lost us the GE, Iraq was the biggest cockup though but those lies came from across the pond. Oil still makes the human world go round, like it or not.
2438 2018-08-23 19:09:08 What about the US illegal invasion of Iraq for oil? Will u look into that too
2439 2018-08-23 19:08:57 Looks a bit low on oil...

2442 2018-08-23 19:08:53 Ah, I see "Protect Colorado" is yet another oil industry shill organization.
2443 2018-08-23 19:08:48 This is great the same moonbat snowflakes that cried because we used paper bags and replaced them w/ plastic bags... but also love using wood for fuel because they hate oil companies... what a fucking confusing life you must live.
2444 2018-08-23 19:08:47 Sinead m'lovely! Where do you get your oil?
2445 2018-08-23 19:08:42 I love the first drive after an oil change
2446 2018-08-23 19:08:23 Balls 40 bn deficit from 65m pop and Scotland with a pop of 5m are in for 13 bn of that debt. Utter drivel.
Oh and oil revenue of 38bn not accounted for which is in Scottish waters.
2447 2018-08-23 19:08:17 Tone, stay away from Science. In 1824, Joseph Fourier was not trying to kill the oil industry.
2448 2018-08-23 19:08:16 It's always tempting to eat pesto by the spoonful. It's so very fresh and so very green.

2449 2018-08-23 19:08:13 Season some chicken with salt and pepper. Throw it in a pan with olive oil. Add it to your noodz! So easy.
2450 2018-08-23 19:08:11 Mollie Tibbetts murder is heartbreaking! No excuse for it! But White American Christopher Watts just murdered his pregnant wife, & 2 little girls, and threw their little bodies into an oil well! Where is your Outrage for that? The issue shouldn’t be what nationality the MEN are!!
2451 2018-08-23 19:07:59 In that case, George Lazenby driving a Robin Reliant.

The Reliant can lay oil slicks behind it (they should really get that fixed)
2452 2018-08-23 19:07:58 It’s the ‘most expensive ever’ because we have corruption sitting at the top of the ladder. Oh and apparently no more oil reserves.
2453 2018-08-23 19:07:55 Coconut oil is the greatest sex lube
2454 2018-08-23 19:07:36 I never understood why the US was limited on exporting oil.  It is good news that those restrictions are being lifted.  Of course, OPEC will once again increase their production and kill our industry again. Why we continue to let OPEC set our price is a huge question.
2455 2018-08-23 19:07:36 No worries!  It will just make you sleepy.  CBD oil is a great option for pain relief and it doesn't have any of the "fun" effects of THC.
2456 2018-08-23 19:07:33 Careful.  They might find oil
2457 2018-08-23 19:07:28 slicker than some oil .. got it out the soil
2458 2018-08-23 19:07:18 Is this healthy? I've been hearing a lot of controversy surrounding cooking w/ coconut oil recently 
2459 2018-08-23 19:07:15 Prof. Karin Michels warning coconut oil = poison is interesting enough but more telling story is how FURIOUS the Twitterati ARE at this SCIENCE,  exemplifying our worship of false prophets amidst complete loss of faith.

2462 2018-08-23 19:07:08 I will unfollow you on social media if you talk about oil pulling.
2463 2018-08-23 19:07:06 #Venezuela should stop printing that currency. Go for temporary dollarization and leverage their oil reserves for economic recovery. 1 000 00% inflation isn't something you come back from without IMF support in this global order

2466 2018-08-23 19:06:37 nah, just tea tree oil that soothes and reduces swelling irritations 
2467 2018-08-23 19:06:37 I take it that olive oil is still OK...  :D
2468 2018-08-23 19:06:35 Yo this oil change is taking forever
2469 2018-08-23 19:06:26 I cleanse my face with maroccan or african black soap (make sure to get authentic ones). It worked wonders for me. I had severe acne and I feel like that cleaners were stripping my skin. Anyways I use virgin olive oil for my hair. And it helps a lot
2470 2018-08-23 19:06:24 palm oil and Gala ooooo
2471 2018-08-23 19:06:15 Lmao pep boys gave me a rewards card bc of how often I have to get my car fixed/oil changed 
2472 2018-08-23 19:06:08 Harvard prof is an Idiot. God knows coconut oil has been in use for thousands of years. If poisonous, we would have perished. Put some in his ears so that his brained gets oiled and starts moving.

2476 2018-08-23 19:05:47 Possibly, the food pyramid was made in the 70's. it was based on cherry picked data from the lead scientist for a wheat company.
Similar to how "coconut oil is terrible for you!" came from the ADA, which is primarily funded by the corn and conola industry.
2477 2018-08-23 19:05:36 Still lost. You can't talk slick to a can of oil
2478 2018-08-23 19:05:33 Id bet on canola oil companies, other other industrial seed oils (most olive oil is not actually olive oil, but one of these cheaper poisonous oils)
2479 2018-08-23 19:05:27 My hair hatessss coconut oil
2480 2018-08-23 19:05:16 Its a blend of peanut butter from @pipandnut ,soy sauce, Kashmiri spices, hemp oil & balsamic V smeared on & then slow baked
2481 2018-08-23 19:05:12 Oil or butter in a pan is a damn weapon them pops hurt
2482 2018-08-23 19:05:10 L’Africa Oil Week est un événement important, qui continue de générer de nouvelles opportunités pour les entreprises d’exploration et de production, et qui propose un réseau exclusif et dynamique d’exploitants pétroliers et gaziers en Afrique.
2483 2018-08-23 19:05:05 Shampoo and conditioner I left the conditioner for about 20min on and the  when I'm done I rinsed it out and left it in the bathroom to dry for about 2days and when I was certain that it's dry I applied the oil only an inch not too much, then wore my wig
2484 2018-08-23 19:04:59 Abi...or #freethesheeple anointing oil . How much have you collected
2485 2018-08-23 19:04:59 結構な確率で気味の悪い夢が見れますｗ
2486 2018-08-23 19:04:55 Really ms can you fall a little low down there and see any chances of oil extraction?
2487 2018-08-23 19:04:54 & without oil, without our other resources & inventive capabilities etc etc. Bewildering!
2488 2018-08-23 19:04:46 Bergamot essential oil smells lovely.
2489 2018-08-23 19:04:43 Except Obama and Hilldawg actually sent them arms, ammo, supplies and training. They also used the US Air Force to give them air cover as they stole millions of dollars in oil from Iraq and Syria, and sold it to Turkey. So much for YOUR ability to see truth, huh?
2490 2018-08-23 19:04:42 I just need the lid off of this coconut oil!
2491 2018-08-23 19:04:27 You know it’s cold when your coconut oil is a solid
2492 2018-08-23 19:04:26 Surprisingly my eyelashes havnt fallen out with strips I think cause I don’t just rip them off at night I use micellar water to take them off then sleep with castor oil on my lash line
2493 2018-08-23 19:04:20 Saudi Arabia deliberately search for new troubles & start different types of wars around the world in hope to increase oil prices. The world need to handcuff the wealth-hungry monster.
2494 2018-08-23 19:04:13 No. I’m the oil you need. The oil you want. Not gas.
2495 2018-08-23 19:04:11 I genuinely don't understand the crisis that colleges are too hard for stand up comedians to perform at now.

They make it sound like, "shit, there's no more oil left.  What are we going to do?"
2496 2018-08-23 19:04:02 Well oil isn’t flower lol
2497 2018-08-23 19:04:00 The Dead Man's Fingers I know of are out at sea. We used to find them on subsea structure of oil platforms.
2498 2018-08-23 19:03:52 How much 2 stroke oil did it consume on a tank? 
2499 2018-08-23 19:03:50 Ok...so now 12 billion to farmers and 12 billion to big Oil for Trump’s manufactured crisis....dies anyone else see this as due to Trump’s complete corrupt incompetence in running things
2500 2018-08-23 19:03:45 What are you blabbing about? Are you telling me one of the worlds leading economists Is a liar now? Are you telling me the late Dennis Healey, the former chancellor of the UK, was making It up when he said the rest of the UK would struggle without Scotland's oil? 1/2
2501 2018-08-23 19:03:43 Hi Kelly!  A Harvard professor basically demonized Coconut oil this week.  Can you give everyone some perspective?   #CedarsNutritionChat
2502 2018-08-23 19:03:35 Texas is seeking at least $12 billion for the full coastal spine,  with nearly all of it coming from public funds. Last month, the  government fast-tracked an initial $3.9 billion for three separate, smaller storm barrier projects that would specifically protect oil  facilities.
2503 2018-08-23 19:03:33 KAI always cooks really spicy curry with a lot of chili oil to it... It BURNS!;;

2510 2018-08-23 19:02:46 Thank you ken. I was trying to capture the melancholic beauty of a late Sunday afternoon in November 1993, just before The Clothes Show starts. I really should have done an oil painting of you of course.
2511 2018-08-23 19:02:45 Sweet orange x lemon essential oil makes the best combo for a happy smelling room
2512 2018-08-23 19:02:33 Yes, but Corey is digging into something else right now.  Seriously though, I have seen the financials out there, so the breakdown is available. I'm sure it's a fairly easy search for anyone wanting to find it. 
2513 2018-08-23 19:02:31 I have never seen a pay check from you. And not a drop of beard oil.
2514 2018-08-23 19:02:10 Add some rubbing alcohol in there too...you want the hot water to open up your pores so the soap and alcohol can kill or clean out the oil
2515 2018-08-23 19:02:06 And nobody to buy from us... all that whisky, power, oil, fish etc etc etc...  Bloody hell...

2524 2018-08-23 19:01:06 Hi Roxanne! Cinnamon, citrus, clove and pine could potentially be harmful. However, the two most important factors for essential oil safety are purity of the oils and proper dilution. Our products use oils that are of the highest purity, and are properly diluted.
2525 2018-08-23 19:01:03 More protein, enough carbs, less oil
2526 2018-08-23 19:00:57 Kind of sad I didn’t change my oil myself but no biggie
2527 2018-08-23 19:00:49 Few things annoy me more than getting my oil changed. “Hey, here’s a million other things wrong with your car and it costs at least $500. You must do it today.”  #nothanks

2532 2018-08-23 19:00:17 Are you sure that your adjusting the blend?

Bear in mind that in the real world, every delivery has his own blend and characteristics. And not often you buy oil with the same characteristics of the contracts traded in the futures market
2533 2018-08-23 19:00:08 "You love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy." Psalm 45:7

2538 2018-08-23 18:59:38 Water. Get a spray bottle and spritz your hair with water. Use an oil or butter to seal in moisture.

You can do this whenever your hair feels dry.
2539 2018-08-23 18:59:28 A oil change, thermostat and antifreeze is only costing me $28. Life has just been a blessing
2540 2018-08-23 18:59:27 USA government is killing innocent people everyday using propaganda(nuclear weapons) just to test their power and bullying for oil. Now Trump is tweeting nonsense about SA without fact & proper investigations.
2541 2018-08-23 18:59:21 In Canada's case, yes. Your main exports are energy. We are by far the largest consumer of it in the world. You going to sell electricity, oil sands products, NatGas & such to Europe with cost of shipping included? Good luck.

What good economy does little business with USA? NONE
2542 2018-08-23 18:59:18 @ShekharGupta has gone deep low & going even lower , if goes any lower , he'll find crude oil. 
Bytheway i got this thought from pnd. Nehru, when he saw great potential in me in 1250 BC.
2543 2018-08-23 18:59:13 Ruble fell against $ almost to 70, then returned to below 69 after Central Bank announced it would not be buying $$ until end of September. My guess, will fluctuate between 70 and 80 for long time. This will save budget as long as there is gas and oil to sell.

2545 2018-08-23 18:59:04 Indeed. Knee jerk policy making is very rarely good policy making.

I unfortunately suspect there are other machinations at work here though. It's inevitable that the Tories are deeply aligned with the oil and automotive industries.
2546 2018-08-23 18:59:02 The object of some affection has returned to m’favourite hangout...sipping Prosecco in dungarees.

At the bar, among the glasses and liquors, there’s a bottle of coconut oil.

Careful now.
2547 2018-08-23 18:58:58 Big mad also leads the city in cancer cases as well because of that oil

The Mazda RX8 was notorious for wearing the tips and then using oil like it was going out of fashion!!
2555 2018-08-23 18:58:34 Best example is tooth paste evolution and refined oil. We were using neem stick long time ago. Now bringing the neem paste, it was told neem flavour make stomach diseases. May they are targeting some coconut product in future. May be in another 10 years. Corporates game.

2562 2018-08-23 18:57:34 Let the Harvard professor tell that to a Mallu. He'll be taught the difference between the poisonous junk food that his country, the USA has successfully exported to the world & the healthy gift of nature, our very own coconut oil. Jai Hind.

2582 2018-08-23 18:54:50 Definitely not. I think you can do without hot oil treatments but not without deep conditioner.
2583 2018-08-23 18:54:40 Grapes must be crushed to make wine. Diamonds form under pressure. Olives are pressed to release oil. Seeds grow in darkness. Whenever you feel crushed, under pressure or in darkness, you’re in a powerful place of transformation.

2587 2018-08-23 18:54:22 The reason that they're poor is that their socialist leadet took away the profits from the global rich and gave it to the poor, so the US put sanctions on them (economic warfare) so they couldn't sell their oil to anyone.
2588 2018-08-23 18:54:18 Dont fight one lie with another misrepresentation. The corrupt  US academic health institutions have been hell bent on demonizing cheese & other animal products generally for 50 years with the same argument now being used against coconut oil.

2604 2018-08-23 18:52:52 I have been consuming coconut oil every day, for like 8 years. Lab work has always been excellent.
2605 2018-08-23 18:52:31 I didn’t know people ingested coconut oil.

2608 2018-08-23 18:51:57 I just need a weekend surrounded by my succulents and crystals while i meditate and drink tea and literally only breath the vapor from my oil diffuser. I might die but at least my organs will smell like lavender

2613 2018-08-23 18:51:23 @IndiGo6E travelled from Kolkata to Dubai via Delhi today, received two baggages drenched with mustard oil. Could not access the damage at the airport; only to understand the extent when we opened the baggage at home. How do I get this issue addressed? Extremely disappointed!!!!
2614 2018-08-23 18:51:15 No wonder! Cold pressed coconut oil is on every grocery store’s shelves these days. People across the world are experiencing the versatile benefits of coconut oil/plant. One cheap oil for food/beauty/housekeeping is a nightmare for corporate
2615 2018-08-23 18:51:04 Just looked into some of the customs tariffs that will apply. Random example - virgin olive oil from EU will be liable to import duty of about £1.20 per litre. One isolated case maybe but indicates the cost of things to come.
2616 2018-08-23 18:50:56 I am a huuuuuge fan of kurkuma, but am hesitating to take it in high dosage -- don't ask me why. I try to use healing spices whenever I cook. Curcuma is inside each and every meal. I am in no pain most of the time. Who knows ... ginger, kurkuma and coconut oil might play a role.
2617 2018-08-23 18:50:44 Can you please ban @SecretaryZinke from having anything to do with the department?  He’s a slimy, trophy hunting, oil soaked Koch head who doesn’t belong anywhere near US government. I hope he ends up in jail.

2620 2018-08-23 18:50:33 Did they cap the well when oil was shooting out all in the ocean?
2621 2018-08-23 18:50:31 Don't be ladies, here in the Maldives we use coconut water and oil for a lot of stuff, eating cooking and no it's not harmful in any way. We've been using that shit for generations, similar to most South Asians, don't worry and hack the coconutto.
2622 2018-08-23 18:50:27 gotta get an oil change speakin of cars 
2623 2018-08-23 18:50:17 That makes zero sense.  I graduated with a comp. sci. degree 16 years ago, and even back then, there was never a computer that had to be shut down for 8 hours every night.  What are they doing, changing the oil and rotating the tires every night?
2624 2018-08-23 18:50:13 I understand, I smoked it as well, I smoke a lot every day, but then I stopped because I realised its better to just use it as cbd oil then to get high as a kite.

2633 2018-08-23 18:49:10 Ok y’all listen to this. 

Ever since I got my phone when I was 10, I have been getting calls for a lady named Natalie cooper. Today I went to wal mart to get an oil change and they asked for a phone number. And I gave it to them. And they said “Natalie?” And I was so triggered !
2634 2018-08-23 18:48:59 “Anybody know how far Tulow have gone with the oil and gas explorations? Anybody?”
2635 2018-08-23 18:48:54 Bloody hell! Surely some extra-smart businessman out there,expects us to believe them & stop using the oil,that it may lose it monetary worth & then get it at dirt cheap rate & ship it out so that they may then oil their 'rectums' for easy crapping! 
2636 2018-08-23 18:48:54 Scoscia would be a disaster and oil and water with this front office.
2637 2018-08-23 18:48:51 Yep and those people shelved it because it became uneconomical when oil prices crashed, the shale oil boom occurred and Keystone got approval and no one would sign EE contracts.
Just because some former exec comes out now with a bunch of lies doesn't change that previous fact.

2652 2018-08-23 18:47:20 Volker spiked short rates to kill inflation, which killed the economy. The Fed needed to revive the economy, there was huge room for the dollar to fall, inflation expectations collapsed with oil price. Rates kept falling for maybe a dozen years.

Cbd oil has reduced the amount I use and I am getting closer to not needing it for breakthrough pain and just slow release alongside cbd
2654 2018-08-23 18:47:15 Agreed..   If the price of oil was up where they wanted it, they'd do this deal in a heartbeat....     They'll be back, when oil gets higher...
2655 2018-08-23 18:47:11 when u been been low on fuel and need an oil change 
2656 2018-08-23 18:47:10 The reason the US and UK put in place a dictator was because the prime minister of Iran wanted the proceeds of the sales of their oil to go to Iran and its people. We wanted greater margins... Read more....then speak,.

2669 2018-08-23 18:46:05 Venezuela isn’t at war with anyone. The reason they are poor is that their socialist leaders hired friends and party people to run their nationalized oil and those people didn’t do any maintenance so the most oil rich country in the world produce less oil than a decade ago.

2674 2018-08-23 18:45:38 Oil is on a secular long term decline due to worldwide move to electrification from solar and wind resources. Solar and wind are already dramatically cheaper in many markets for energy production. Once EVs take off, O&G markets will be in turmoil. The hadwriting is on the wall.

2690 2018-08-23 18:44:25 thats Capitalist markets for, an oil crash just like before which resulted in 75% poverty rates, inflation in the thousands & mass shooting on the streets in the 1980/90s under the neo-libs The opposition refused to take part in elections.  Nothings changed....accept 4 sanctions
2691 2018-08-23 18:44:11 And in regards to world view...well, the world is changing rapidly and it's an exciting time to be alive. We're witnessing age-old institutions such as banks and oil companies second-guessing their future. BTC and renewables are two innovations that are disrupting the old guys 
2692 2018-08-23 18:44:08 I’m hopefully buying it tomorrow I just wanted to know if the oil is good for those with oily skin?
2693 2018-08-23 18:44:06 Pipelines, oil. If you think these wars aren't about money or resources aka capital you are  being profoundly naive.  Why do you think most of them are in the Middle East.  Look up Venezuela and Somalia and oil.
2694 2018-08-23 18:44:06 I actually use both! Fish oil at night because that’s when I take vitamin D so helpful
2695 2018-08-23 18:43:55 How?? Y'all can msg me - its not letting me. The ad y'all sent for a $14.95 oil change was false - Rocky Mount Wesleyan said.
2696 2018-08-23 18:43:47 I dress, plant to go out, after dressing I be like those I'm going to see,did they bother to come see me then I cancel plan.
Can't be only me
2697 2018-08-23 18:43:39 Coconut oil has been proven to be very good for females especially to have in moderation. There are so many things we eat that can potentially be bad if over-consumed. I’m tired of the media going overboard with certain shit. It’s almost as if they don’t want us to be healthier..
2698 2018-08-23 18:43:36 Essential Oils may just have saved my Marriage !  Carla reports I have not been snoring the last few nights, since I started using some Valor & thyme Oil on my feet and RC oil for 1 hr, in the Diffuser at night. Watch for my story at @NightWellness soon

2701 2018-08-23 18:43:27 fire everyone on the board and sell the club to an oil rich saudi and sell pogba/martial. buy dembele/savic/alderweireld and varane
2702 2018-08-23 18:43:22 Not at all. Your point in regards other small nations is daft. We have 90% oil 25% food and drink in uk. Which is a fair wee whack more than most small countries . So your argument is rather insipid.
2703 2018-08-23 18:43:16 What an arsehole, why the fuck did you beg us to stay in your godforsaken union if we are a burden? Could it be our worthless oil, whisky, gin, water...etc. let us go!

2706 2018-08-23 18:42:59 The use of the term "ink", a nebulous and ephemeral substance, is, in fact, a tribute to the printer huckster's predecessor: the snake oil salesman.
2707 2018-08-23 18:42:52 @adndotcom i am hearing some news of a oil spill in or near Bristol bay..do you have any information?
2708 2018-08-23 18:42:50 The Police said that they did not say that, and the owner of the chain is son of the lying Ian Wood who told us the oil was running out in the North sea, a couple of days before indy 2014.
2709 2018-08-23 18:42:49 Did you know that the 10% supplementary charge that Scotland is allocated in GERS is only part of the income from oil & gas from Scotland. HMRC also charges a 30% RFCT on profits based on the oil companies HQ location. This is London for the largest companies. 30% being c£10.2Bn?
2710 2018-08-23 18:42:46 Or fish oil if you aren’t vegan. They have cheap capsules to take like pills. Vitamins E, D, K and A only absorb in combination with fats. 
2711 2018-08-23 18:42:45 A positive note: refined oil exports already at 1.6bn rolling 12mo and growing
A quasi-negative: automobiles growing (need to see which kind of autos)

Imports from Canada growing strongly
2712 2018-08-23 18:42:41 $CPG Hard to see much downside risk with a yield of 4.25%, multi-year SP low and oil in an uptrend
2713 2018-08-23 18:42:30 10. What's the fate of NNPC? A National Oil Company with conflicting roles. When will Nigeria set an agenda for its oil industry with the passage of PIB/PIGB/etc? 

When will NNPC become just another oil company paying taxes and dividends?

2720 2018-08-23 18:42:01 Here's what I think happened. 'Poison' is translated as 'das gift' in German. She meant to say coconut oil is god's gift. She has no idea it means 'poison' in German. There! :)
2721 2018-08-23 18:41:58 I think Marijuana was mainly used for the anointing oil, and not to smoke, by smkoing marijuana I think you open yourself up to influences from other entities.
2722 2018-08-23 18:41:40 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @LouDobbs Hey Sean so why are we exporting oil while we are paying $3 a gallon at the pump? Please explain......why not keep that oil here and make gas cheaper for Americans?

2733 2018-08-23 18:40:37 I’m curious why she heats the oil—to draw out the herb flavors quickly perhaps? 

She doesn’t mention the botulism factor, although she does mention, frequently, to make sure the herbs and bottles are completely dry. Water apparently allows bacteria to grow in the oil.

2746 2018-08-23 18:39:27 The reduction was warranted to help restore confidence and grow the oil & gas industry after the oil price fell. As the price has recovered, it is no longer warranted to be so low.

Extraction costs vary considerably and Norway has a state oil industry. Not really comparable.

2784 2018-08-23 18:36:20 you can use coconut oil to help remove it, usually you should be able to just pull them off. if she's trying to clue them all just kinda drag it lightly across the band and let it sit for a couple of seconds then try to place them? that's how I usually do it
2785 2018-08-23 18:36:10 To understand effect of coconut oil (CO) on life expectancy(LE), all other factors (ed, income, hospital, hygiene..) effecting LE need also to be considered. Since these factors are better for CO consuming states than Indian av, Dr. Michels has a point there.

2835 2018-08-23 18:30:36 Demand for oil isn’t going anywhere. We’re burning it out our tail pipes & it’s in thousands of products we use. Canada works to cut emissions while Nations we remain dependant on, don’t give a crap. Your solution is to shut down our oil and become even more dependent on others.
2836 2018-08-23 18:30:36 I have never used coconut oil for cooking, guess nobody in north does, but it can’t be any worse than butter. Anyway, what cooking oil do you think is healthiest?

The pipeline itself should be treated separately from oil tankers & exports.

Also there is the constitutional, jurisdictional aspect.

And of course the national implications. Including pipelines eastward and oil imports.

2867 2018-08-23 18:28:05 Eastland on its last leg blood. I’m just here for the oil bar.
2868 2018-08-23 18:28:02 @AndrewScheer

This is a great strategic move...Andrew. 
Move 2: phase out Foreign Oil..we use our own...65 billion barrels in reserve...phase out by 2022.
2869 2018-08-23 18:27:59 Appropriate WW2 propaganda: 1. Queen & Country. 2. Ur country needs u. 3. Lose lips sink ships. 4. In Germany, someone is doing the same job as u. Beat him! 5. The man who wasted precious oil! Don’t wast oil. Not a drop, not a splash! 6. Stand firm. 7. It’s a full time job to win
2870 2018-08-23 18:27:58 Lil' @SenTedCruz is all about cutting spending for things like #SuperstormSandy, but blowing billions on taxpayer funds to help the oil industry from a mess they helped create? Spend, spend, spend! Vote this hack out!
2871 2018-08-23 18:27:52 South Indians, particularly the Konkan belt is using coconut oil for millineums, AND ARE THEY ALL DEAD? In fact, poison is there in so called intelligentsia who put forth their half baked knowledge, which is backed by mentally illiterate Westerners.
2872 2018-08-23 18:27:50 i usually wash every two or three days if im not too cursed by depression to be unable to get out of bed and i love using those pretentious coconut oil and shea butter shampoo and conditioner products but shampoo with zinc pyrithione is great for when i have a dandruff problem
2873 2018-08-23 18:27:40 Im all about the coconut oil at the moment.

2876 2018-08-23 18:27:29 Mr. Snake Oil Salesman, your party is fragmenting. Your leader is a wimpy.
2877 2018-08-23 18:27:23 How often are you supposed to get an oil change?
2878 2018-08-23 18:27:22 Olive oil
2879 2018-08-23 18:27:16 Invest and train in the future? Make a new middle class job industry in renewable energy. Good paying jobs. What was Obama's oil exports by the way?
2880 2018-08-23 18:26:51 Bruh what is baby oil sex?
2881 2018-08-23 18:26:47 If he loved Russia he wouldn’t be expanding oil production, arming the Ukrainians, missile defense to poland, modernizing our nukes..  as opposed to obama who’s first act as president was to dismantle the missile defense shield.
2882 2018-08-23 18:26:44 P sure my oil change tech just crop dusted me
2883 2018-08-23 18:26:41 Vegans and vegetarians went crazy when the Harvard professor said coconut oil is “pure poison” #jk
2884 2018-08-23 18:26:36 @SenatorCharles 40% of US corn is refined for biodiesel. Iowa farmers depend on this. Can we use GOP-Promised reconstruction money to repurpose our oil refineries for biodiesel?
2885 2018-08-23 18:26:33 Getting the oil changed before my Chicago trip tomorrow.

2890 2018-08-23 18:26:04 Indeed, I'm from the Philippines I think coconut is oil is for everything. I didn't hear people dying in coconut oil.
2891 2018-08-23 18:26:02 #herbchat I have used herbs in frozen oil ice cubes. That is an easy way to preserve many herbs. Especially for cooking and soups.
2892 2018-08-23 18:25:42 Tea Tree oil is really that girl.
2893 2018-08-23 18:25:37 It could be. Her body was on shallow grave  whereas daughters were inside tank oil. Different places.
2894 2018-08-23 18:25:34 My dad checked my car’s oil and tires but he didn’t check that my gas light was on and didn’t fill it up
2895 2018-08-23 18:25:23 what's the point of vaping if the oil doesn't have nicotine or thc in it?

the smoke is still going to fuck with your lungs, correct?
2896 2018-08-23 18:25:21 You guys need to chill the fuck out with the coconut oil
2897 2018-08-23 18:25:19 Make sure that you read the labels not all products are the same look at the ingredients you want nothing but the plant no fillers ie coconut oil glycerine etc. I take a brand since October I don’t have what your mom does but this has definitely helped

2899 2018-08-23 18:24:53 it is often joked that konkani & malayali people use coconut oil as cooking oil & palm oil as hair oil
2900 2018-08-23 18:24:52 This is pathetic ..use only indigenous oil for cooking hairs ..all foreign oils are not fpr our genes ..our genes thrived in coconut oil , in sarso oil etc ...
2901 2018-08-23 18:24:44 eating breakfast at a restaurant and these two guys next to me

2903 2018-08-23 18:24:28 Charlotte put a chunk of coconut oil in her mouth trying to whiten her teeth and went 'it'll melt'

It did not melt

2907 2018-08-23 18:23:44 Avocado and coconut oil okay for cooking?
2908 2018-08-23 18:23:41 I totally get your point. But trust me my situation was unhealthy really. She would sleep at my home for weeks at time, even in my bed (i had a "couch wich turn into a bed", wich was my only couch/bed), ask me to give her massage with oil (while she was topless) and stuff lik tat
2909 2018-08-23 18:23:27 Just say Venezuela and the largest oil reserves in the modern world but collapsing completely lol from socialist capitalism lol. Give a week or two citizens are trying to rush the borders of Brazil. Other nations are kicking them out of their tent cities they are building scary.

2912 2018-08-23 18:23:13 idk what's going on recently but my skin has always been drier than a room when i crack a joke. now im waking up with buckets of oil in my crevices. what is my body tryna tell me?
2913 2018-08-23 18:23:11 This shit is trading Algos. Humans trade on emotion and this market isn't human at all. When manafort got indicted last Feb the market tanked and VIX went to 40  Now we have 10X as many things manafort, cohen, china, turkey,tariffs, Nafta, higher rates, slowing housing, high oil
2914 2018-08-23 18:23:05 While we do need to look for fundamentals determining the right entry points is also key. There is now a clear 4 year market cycle driven by presidential elections. Superimpose on that oil price movements and Naira/$ valuation. These affect all stocks no matter the fundamentals.
2915 2018-08-23 18:23:01 All that oil that would spew out 
2916 2018-08-23 18:23:00 Big business (a side from oil and other anti-environmental industries) consistently support MORE regulation. It creates a bottle neck effect and prevents competition. They don't want a free market they want a market that favors them. This is achieved through government regulation
2917 2018-08-23 18:22:53 Yes they have but new technology makes this possible! Recently discovered in The Midland Basin of the Wolfcamp Shale area was over 20 billion barrels of oil and 1.6 Billion barrels of natural gas! This is the largest "continuous oil" discovery in the USA!
2918 2018-08-23 18:22:52 I have to get an oil change today. RT @KGkindaSpicy: I hate doing car shit
2919 2018-08-23 18:22:46 Groundnut oil
2920 2018-08-23 18:22:42 I've always heard coconut oil is good for everything all my life, and then I moved countries and all I hear is that almost everything causes Cancer.
2921 2018-08-23 18:22:41 Jimmy, academics are just as corrupt as politicians. They market for cheap industrial food & against expensive natural foods. The mechanism is the same: $$$. Saturated fat is good for you. Coconuts like olives need only to be pressed for oil, as opposed to the horrors for canola.
2922 2018-08-23 18:22:36 Also Karin Michels Said Beef is Poison So NO COW SLAUGHTERING. as BEEF FAT , As per The American Heart Association said its data shows 50 percent Fat,leads to High Cholesterol and Heart Disease.Oil consumption is in Grams where as In BEEF is in Pounds. @Swamy39 @HinduAmerican

2925 2018-08-23 18:22:23 Coconut oil good for health.....no doubts
2926 2018-08-23 18:22:21 five of the worst:” the Fast and Furious gun-running operation, the Benghazi attacks, the fumbled response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the Obamacare rollout and allegations that the IRS targeted conservative groups.
2927 2018-08-23 18:22:21 凄いんだけど、なんか不毛なものを見てる感じがするのは何でだろうな……
2928 2018-08-23 18:22:04 Yeah it's definitely good to ease into it instead of jumping into the deep end. I cooked some oil and have made a couple batches of brownies the past month and those definitely require a little restraint
2929 2018-08-23 18:22:02 I JUST LOVE MY 750mg

2933 2018-08-23 18:21:11 A little story about what started me going, a while back, on the transition away from Whale Oil as a metaphor and potential mini-model for the energy transition that we need to make, It starts (of course) in New Bedford MA. (THREAD ALERT)
2934 2018-08-23 18:21:10 Can you explain why our deficit is 25 times larger than Ireland's? How much fucking oil have those guys got? We have 80% of the Whisky market. Ireland has 4%. Where are they getting all the money? Wake up Winnie.
2935 2018-08-23 18:21:10 Take note: democrat criticizes US ceasing oil flow to imperial Japan which was using said oil to fund a war machine committing abominable HR atrocities, criticizes current admin for taking same stance
2936 2018-08-23 18:21:05 Finally getting my oil changed and my headlight replaced  just a few months over due. 
2937 2018-08-23 18:21:03 You can't call fatty acids poison?
Coconut oil contains palmitric,myristic, and lauric acids. These all raise LDL cholesterol considerably.
Your conspiracies are irrelevant to basic biology.
2938 2018-08-23 18:20:58 It’s for an Oil pipeline which is smart

2942 2018-08-23 18:20:23 #herbchat I may be preserving them in vingear or oil. These last two weeks have me thinking. I plan to take tips cuttings to start some new plants, also. Rosemary and lavendar, esp.
2943 2018-08-23 18:20:18 So, what's everyone having or had f9e dinner? I've finally had enough of endless salad so cooked a slimming world friendly fry up. Bacon medallions, eggs, beans, mushrooms and peeled plum tomatoes. All in frylight. 

And so little mess compared to oil. 

I am a terrible cook.
2944 2018-08-23 18:20:11 HAHAHHA funny so please enplane why there has been food shortages for the last 10 years there?

2949 2018-08-23 18:19:58 When the price of oil goes down the guys on the rigs get laid off. Extra spending drops, foreclosures and repos increase, tax revenue drops and the deficit goes up. In other words— what’s going on right now. (I kinda do read up on local economic news.)

2961 2018-08-23 18:18:23 I never get an oil change without getting a haircut at the same time. If someone could open a car shop/hair salon combo, I'd be set.

2963 2018-08-23 18:18:13 They have to deflate the derivatives into a new currency or commodity. They can’t use gold or silver because of industrial use. They can’t use the interest rate of the FED because of the bond market. They can’t let it hit oil, food, etc. They’re trapped and must use the cryptos.

2965 2018-08-23 18:18:07 Getting an oil change 

Not just cause it was low, either. I was 32 mile away from the mark. 
2966 2018-08-23 18:17:52 I've worked in the oil field. If you can build a better business case than oil, it will get financing. It's all about money, and #fossilfuel is the money they know. 
Protest only hurt the image of renewables as a fringe hippy movement. We need people in suits, not tents.
2967 2018-08-23 18:17:52 I gotta find a better ventilated place to work. I can already feel the oil paint headaches coming on.
2968 2018-08-23 18:17:50 May be in the Northern part of Nigeria. Where I am, a bottle of oil is #800, 1 pent of Yellow Harris is #500

2973 2018-08-23 18:17:33 Someone was telling me about all oil being bad for you to digest. They suggested substituting veggie broth. It’s been great so far for me!
2974 2018-08-23 18:17:29 Cos that would mean allowing the USA Corporations into strip there assets oil in particular leaving them strip bare at the end of it Nina
2975 2018-08-23 18:17:21 Mr. Hannity, this is great news for those of you that have money to invest in shares of oil corporate stocks. The rest of us are busy trying to stay within our weekly food budget while keeping enough money  for gas so we can drive to our low wage, part-time, no benefits jobs!
2976 2018-08-23 18:17:19 bread and butter is the most popular food in this country, and an appetizer in any restaurant it's not like we're classy but depending on the area people would either put olive oil, fresh cheese, jam or nothing on bread i think. beans were for dinner

2978 2018-08-23 18:17:09 That's so funny because I am the same way. Even my oldest son didn't want to leave! He loved looking around at all of the cool things in their store made from olive oil.  #FreshFoodieTrail #VisitMesa

2991 2018-08-23 18:15:45 I'm currently waiting on an electric oil diffuser from Aliexpress to get here because they are so expensive in S.A. but I get my essential oils from Dischem, try the Dischem brand, it's called Nature's Edition and it's way less cheaper than other brands

2993 2018-08-23 18:15:34 Consumption methods of cannabis include: 
1. FLOWER - dried cannabis flowers inhaled as smoke or vapor
2. EXTRACTS - cannabis concentrates like hash oil, wax & shatter
3. TOPICALS - cannabis-infused creams, lotions & balms  
4. EDIBLES - any food or beverage infused with cannabis
2994 2018-08-23 18:15:24 It's not "who the hell lives there?" It's  "enough people live there to have a phone provider?"

Also I've learnt that UK and USA and maybe other countries are trying to call dibs on Antarctica because when the ice melts they'll be able to search for oil
2995 2018-08-23 18:15:23 A real coconutty professor! 
Does he think an entire race who literally 'bathe' in coconut oil are all zombies?!
2996 2018-08-23 18:15:17 @ImranKhanPTI @Asad_Umar Sir lots of foreign companies who work in Pakistan especially French companies in medicine & in oil field (total) convert all there profits in dollars and send abroad on monthly basis which are in millions of dollars no one take action against them why?
2997 2018-08-23 18:15:13 The price of gasoline is way too high for the pricing of a barrel of oil at current pricing. 
Please investigate pricing over gasoline over the last 4 years versus the pricing of a barrel of oil. You will see the gouging that is occurring.

2999 2018-08-23 18:15:11 @HyundaiCanada Thank you!! Got a recall notice to check for metal debris in my engine, but because I use synthetic engine oil (which was recommended by the service dept when I bought the car) now I must pay the difference in engine oil cost even though it's a recall! Wow

3003 2018-08-23 18:15:00 I started seeing a big difference two weeks in and awesome results once I finished it and I use natural aloe vera as a moisturizer if you have acne scars I recommend buying castor oil and leaving it over night and wash it off in the morning

3008 2018-08-23 18:14:38 If you move to the suburbs it just comes with everything automatically. Chicken tenders? Side of ranch. Your morning coffee? Side of ranch. Oil change, electric bill, prostate exam? SIDE OF RANCH!
3009 2018-08-23 18:14:33 tip for adulting: never go to walmart for your oil changes (some ppl might be like no shit but to me it was cheaper and made no difference ) but in hind sight it takes FOREVER, poor customer service, and valvoline always has coupons so youre not really saving any money!
3010 2018-08-23 18:14:31 Chutzpah defined: Big Oil wants us to pay to harden its refineries against climate change Big Oil helped cause, while opposing city lawsuits asking Big Oil to help harden cities against climate change Big Oil helped cause.

3014 2018-08-23 18:14:07 Okay. Give back all the profit made and squandered from North Sea Oil in Scottish waters and then tell us England subsidises Scotland.
3015 2018-08-23 18:14:05 I had nothing but joy, both in 2008 & 2016. She was/is the most qualified person EVER to run for the highest office in the land and it was stolen by a misogynistic populace, Russian government and a racist snake oil salesman.  Shame on you Joe because you could have done more.

3018 2018-08-23 18:13:59 Well you’ve got a mix here...gold is malleable, shiny and stays clean.  Valuable as a tool.  Oil is a fuel for specific things...mostly power.  Degrades. Dirty.  Neither are essential for survival so neither are invaluable.  Oil degrades things that are essential.  Gold does not.

Some of which should probably be done, but I've only had it for 6k miles, so I don't know. :/

3033 2018-08-23 18:12:32 I never seem to be able to use up an entire fresh herb bunch, and a few years ago, I wrote about ways to use rosemary, which I *always* have leftover. One way was to infuse it in oil. A reader quickly pointed me to an FDA article about botulism in herb-infused oils. #herbchat
3034 2018-08-23 18:12:26 so what's Natasha's accent??? #thearchers
3035 2018-08-23 18:12:25 Can you send the pictures  of his Oil Press...?
3036 2018-08-23 18:12:21 “Emerging opportunities in the Arctic” WTF? Is this how you view Catastrophic Fossil Fuel Caused Climate Change? With leadership like this we are doomed. We need uncorrupted leaders to combat Climate Change not Big Money donor apologists under the influence of oil. RESIGN NOW!
3037 2018-08-23 18:12:15 I believe that Saudi Arabia committed the 9/11 attacks, but America forgave them for the sake of oil and money, and that's an evidence that Money is Stronger than Jesus!
3038 2018-08-23 18:12:12 this is a ploy to bring down price for this precious oil 
3039 2018-08-23 18:12:11 the oil kept splashing on me that shit hurt I wish I had a personal chef
3040 2018-08-23 18:12:10 In Konkan region (we don't use coconut oil but) we put coconut in everything. Dal, rice, idli(we call it sandan), poha, vegetarian and non-vegetarian meals. This is the reason coconut flavour of Naturals ice cream is the best seller.
3041 2018-08-23 18:11:59 I believe that Saudi Arabia committed the 9/11 attacks, but America forgave them for the sake of oil and money, and that's an evidence that Money is Stronger than Jesus!
3042 2018-08-23 18:11:44 My obsession with coconut is becoming a bit much, coconut kinder Buenos, coconut peanut and almond butters, copious amounts of coconut oil for cooking and coconut teas..... think a intervention will be needed soon
3043 2018-08-23 18:11:35 I agree, we need more Saudi oil less dirty tar oil. Travel via the ocean is much safer And if it spills you don't see it, shhhhh.
3044 2018-08-23 18:11:31 2. Most gold, diamonds, much copper, oil, uranium, bauxite, etc. comes from Africa.

3. Africa is completely in the Tropics and has no major seismic activity. It is also 2/3 to a mile above sea level - handy when the poles melt - which is why mankind surived to evolve in Africa.

3054 2018-08-23 18:10:44 We need to look at what their cholesterol, triglycerides, etc. are. We had an Indian friend couldn’t control his cholesterol which he and his doctor attributed to the use of coconut oil during his time before moving to U.S.

3061 2018-08-23 18:10:09 #herbchat When I just googled it, that was the number two response - herbs in oil botulism.
3062 2018-08-23 18:10:08 Coconut Oil is science and art of ancient India. 
Havard can never stand for nanosecond against the technique developed by ancient Indians.
Havard is like microbes in Milky way.
e.g. Can any Havardian know how to travel to other galaxy in 1 nanosecond?

3065 2018-08-23 18:09:55 I hate capitalism, except when it works for me.  Otherwise, everything should be free.  My hands are open open for business!  I especially love transfer payments from the rich oil goons in Sask and Alberta.
3066 2018-08-23 18:09:35 Keep up with the research!  Stay healthy!  Exercise n diet! Pray over everything!  Eat Vegan for your cholesterol level occasionally!  Coconut oil in moderation!
3067 2018-08-23 18:09:32 Thank you for watching beaut  I just watched your pamper routine & you’ve made me want to try the Lush bath oil melt thingy

3074 2018-08-23 18:08:40 I would love to get your perspective on PoS systems wrt interest/inflation rates. You can talk about dilution, lockup time, penalties, and why you think it may or may not be sustainable.

It would also give you another opportunity to draw comparisons to $BTC, gold, and oil.
3075 2018-08-23 18:08:39 Right on thank you
3076 2018-08-23 18:08:23 In South India people mostly uses coconut oil. Going with research till date mostly South Indian would have been dead or suffering from dangerous decease but no such report is there in public domain.
3077 2018-08-23 18:08:19 That was before the U.S. got the Saudis to drop their oil price from $80 to $20 a barrel then imposed sanctions.
3078 2018-08-23 18:08:16 This is an important distinction to get out there in time for those who will listen to have an informed opinion before they vote.  The NDP is not putting in policies that generally will hurt oil and gas investment.  #ableg #abpoli

3083 2018-08-23 18:07:38 Venezuela isn't the only country in the world that has had economic troubles especially from something like relying on oil prices. should they reform? Of course. Should they undo all their work and give wealth to oligarchy? No.
3084 2018-08-23 18:07:20 She definitely spoke positively and in favour.
A really nice girl and it has been ever so interesting comparing our different lifestyles. She has visited London today and  has had a great week with us.
3085 2018-08-23 18:07:20 Developing, not looting, home countries would go a long way in preventing mass migration. If life is horrible, unsafe & there's no work, anywhere is better. But 'looters gotta loot' (oligarchs/plutocrats) natural resources (gems, minerals, oil, land, etc) from 'poor' countries.
3086 2018-08-23 18:07:15 Oil rich Venezuela is currently printing money faster than a bee flaps it's wings, drowning further down in hyper inflation.

Oil has demons. I can not convince you otherwise
3087 2018-08-23 18:07:14 Breakfast: bread + olive oil, fruit

3088 2018-08-23 18:07:14 The guy who strangled his two little girls & dumped them in a barrel of crude oil was an American citizen born here. He was also a man. The problem here seems to be MEN! Men are the danger.
3089 2018-08-23 18:07:13 looks like an old oil painting
3090 2018-08-23 18:07:10 Same thing goes for us too with regards to oil.

3093 2018-08-23 18:06:43 Well, Chiropractic ain't alternetive, it is a solide but not much respected part of Medicine and i'd like to keep to the old saying
"There is more between heaven and earth then your Mind could get horatio"
So maybe ceep an open mind to some stuff that ain't snake oil.
3094 2018-08-23 18:06:43 AIPAC, CAIR, NRA, Wall Street, big oil, big pharma, big food, etc. all influence elections, not to mention BUDGETS. All this concern over Russia 'meddling' in elections is kind of moot, considering. I swear Americans step over Benjamins to pick up dimes. Horse THEN cart!
3095 2018-08-23 18:06:41 When I’m getting a happy ending at the local Asian massage parlor I make sure they rub coconut oil on my cock
3096 2018-08-23 18:06:39 The Aramco IPO is officially cancelled.  The Saudis wanted to conquer Yemen and have $80 per barrel oil before the IPO. These have not happened.  The price of oil still make reach $80 per barrel is Venezuela and Iran collapse.
3097 2018-08-23 18:06:36 Go figure hey!  Who would've thought about coconut oil.
3098 2018-08-23 18:06:22 @HotelChocolat Why are you using palm oil in your Caesar chocolates? It’s fairly disappointing to see.
3099 2018-08-23 18:06:14 Apparently there is left wing snake oil as well, James. These guys are just as slimy as the right wing variety, just as venomous.
3100 2018-08-23 18:06:13 Dont forget the #oil. Without the flow of the petro dollar throughout the world we would be hauling worthless money around for a second time
3101 2018-08-23 18:05:56 My hair doesn't even like coconut oil. And for longest thought I was doing something wrong cause everybody on YouTube swore by it.

3105 2018-08-23 18:05:38 Looking At the tweeds you have posted. You feel threatened by that? I stand corrected your not a conspiracy theorist your a snowflake pu*#y. I work in the oil field and we talk to each other worse than that daily. Man grow a pair would ya!
3106 2018-08-23 18:05:37 They didn't "refuse". The process was ongoing. We have to consider more than just the greedy whims of private companies.  

And I'm not sure you are aware of the ongoing and consistent subsidization of the entire oil and gas sector.
3107 2018-08-23 18:05:19 Caffeine can act as an appetite suppressant! Also, if your coffee is unfiltered (like espresso or French press), there are small amounts of oil (specifically cafestol) in it, which increases satiety.
3108 2018-08-23 18:05:18 Soooo I left a little earlier than anticipated at work and I’m sitting at delta sonic getting my oil changed hoping it doesn’t take as long as it does on a weekend

3115 2018-08-23 18:04:53 The oil industry wants our tax dollars to be spent on protecting their refineries from the intense storms caused by climate change. They want a 60 mile barrier built and send the bill to the taxpayers.

They're called Buñuelos.
3118 2018-08-23 18:04:46 Yeah.

3120 2018-08-23 18:04:31 Also, don't vape olive oil eh @Mr_J_Divy ?
3121 2018-08-23 18:04:23 It’s probably just a coincidence that big oil hasn’t been attacking Polis.

3127 2018-08-23 18:03:49 Today I learned a valuable lesson and a blessing from God, check my engine oil to my car more often....
3128 2018-08-23 18:03:44 Yes and consumption of coconut oil is one of those reasons according to the researcher in question. Indians don't eat a lot of red meat so there's one removed. Though that is changing so odds are CVD will increase as well.
3129 2018-08-23 18:03:42 Omg I just me some Popeye & Olive oil
3130 2018-08-23 18:03:39 They won't care because they've been drinking Trump's snake oil elixir.  And you keep telling them how wonderful the elixir is, despite the fact that it's making them sick: businesses are in a tailspin over Trump's tariffs; his endless lying sickens us.
3131 2018-08-23 18:03:34 If petrol stations and the infrastructure to supply them are the responsibility of the oil companies why are electric charging points the responsibility of the local council and TfL? #sadiqkhan #
3132 2018-08-23 18:03:34 probably saying 'coconut oil is poison' is just to divert attention from the extensive use of palm oil in packed food, which is actually harmful , probably they will release a report saying 'palm oil is elixir'
3133 2018-08-23 18:03:34 I use to work there  shit was nasty ! The fried good when they are 2 seconds out the oil
3134 2018-08-23 18:03:26 the Northern Elite  does not care whose ox is gored... Their interest is in the oil wells in the SS... Once it's within their grasp, anything that threatens their power is crippled, destroyed and forgotten

Who is the minister for petroleum? #FreeOwerri112
3135 2018-08-23 18:03:17 Dawn Butler is over reacting. Jamie is simply making a variation of a rice dish that uses some of the Jerk herbs and spices. Western chefs use sesame oil for frying when the Chinese only use for garnishing a dish at the end because it doesn't have a high smoke point. No ruckus.

3142 2018-08-23 18:02:45 Where are all the republicans screaming about Christopher Watts who murdered his wife and two little girls and dumped them in an oil well?  Oh yea, he is white.  
3143 2018-08-23 18:02:44 I did think about it, but back in the day the term was snake oil salesman...Lol.
3144 2018-08-23 18:02:39 And that was without oil money involved. Keep things in perspective. Remember even during the good times the knives were out for Sir Alex at times. I would hate to see what it would've been like if social media was a thing. Patience. It took Cantona & Keane to complete the jigsaw
3145 2018-08-23 18:02:33 So a Harvard Professor says "Coconut oil is Pure Poison". Well professor, it's surely less then your words and research on it.
3146 2018-08-23 18:02:19 @pepboysauto over 2 hours for an oil change after being told 30 mins. Appreciate the waste of a day
3147 2018-08-23 18:02:11 I brought my moms Tahoe to get the oil change and they dead ass lost the keys
3148 2018-08-23 18:01:55 Just tried my first  bulletproof coffee. Coconut oil and butter. I think i drank it too quick. 
3149 2018-08-23 18:01:49 Snake oil salesmen selling socialism. That medicine is poison.
3150 2018-08-23 18:01:41 #Pray Father pour out the oil of joy into my spirit, that I may not be overwhelmed by the things that I go through in this season.

3152 2018-08-23 18:01:35 I have to get my oil changed today. I fucking hate driving on the motorway. It always makes me so anxious. Eh I’ll survive.
3153 2018-08-23 18:01:25 Do you think we’ll go strictly drone warfare, or as we call it the “Obama strategy,” when we invade Venezuela for their oil... I mean to save the people from a “dictator”... or do you think we’ll use foot soldiers?
3154 2018-08-23 18:01:18 I came to Midas for an oil change ONLYThis man say I need tires...$800 Come again I didn’t hear you
3155 2018-08-23 18:01:16 #WeGoTogetherLike oil and water
3156 2018-08-23 18:01:15 Any kind of oil becomes poisonous if heated to such an extent that it starts smoking. Coconut oil having high smoke point only helps.
3157 2018-08-23 18:01:13 oil slick lookin ahhhhhh
3158 2018-08-23 18:01:12 Trump has revealed himself to be nothing more than a mafia don, which most people with at least half a functioning brain already knew. Mueller has already taken down one Teflon Don (Gotti) & he certainly won't have any trouble taking down this traitorous snake oil salesman.
3159 2018-08-23 18:01:11 #WeGoTogetherLike oil and a rusted tanker ship.
3160 2018-08-23 18:01:00 If you're a fellow lover of this aromatic herb, then you're in for a savory treat with my Vervana Rosemary Cold Pressed Olive Oil! What's unique about this flavored olive oil is that it's made using the "agrumato" or "fused" method...#Vervana #ColdPressedOliveOil #EatWell
3161 2018-08-23 18:01:00 "Love cannot endure indifference It needs to be wanted Like a lamp, it needs to be fed out of the oil of another's heart, or its flame burns low"
3162 2018-08-23 18:00:50 Because 99% of that energy is coming out of dirty gas/oil/cole energy plants. With that energy you can feed a whole country instead of solving crypto riddles. Use the hash power to search for radiosignals(seti) or crack DNA codes to find cures! Wake up man!
3163 2018-08-23 18:00:48 Oil Barron’s don’t dump fracking waste on their own kids, either. It’s almost like corporations aren’t moral or democratic, and their billionaires lack a social conscience, go figure!
3164 2018-08-23 18:00:45 THose two little beautiful girls shouldn’t have been strangled by their daddy & dumped in a barrel of crude oil. The common thread in these violent deaths is gender not citizenship status.
3165 2018-08-23 18:00:39 Very true. Two things we should not rely on Western research. 1. Food. 2. Medicines. Both poisonous. 
They tell us not to use coconut oil, but they happily use MCT oil as medical supplement, which is nothing but coconut oil!!!
3166 2018-08-23 18:00:34 Working hard to push a dirty oil pipeline expansion through all the climate change caused fires.

3171 2018-08-23 18:00:13 Indeed. Mustard + (eggs - egg whites) + olive oil = Mayo

3174 2018-08-23 18:00:00 Sprinkling a little salt in a frying pan will prevent oil from splattering
3175 2018-08-23 17:59:58 Wonder if the refreshers ones are like the tea tree oil ones, giving that tingling feeling to your nether regions.

3181 2018-08-23 17:59:23 @FinMinIndia Dear Sir, Bringing GST into live and to a working position is a very good thing. But what about the most anticipated product which is still not included in the GST positive list. Crude Oil and all of its products. #petrolprices #GSTonPetrol
3182 2018-08-23 17:59:21 #WeGoTogetherLike oil and water
3183 2018-08-23 17:59:18 Exactly right.
3184 2018-08-23 17:59:13 With rain fall in last 24hrs grass is likely to really start motoring. With the flush there’ll be a big staggers and bloat risk looming so remember to make sure grazing stock are getting plenty of mag and oil.
3185 2018-08-23 17:59:07 11. I don't him not to. Keep a poker face in class until we decide the best route.
3186 2018-08-23 17:58:56 actually Chitts...I just realised, it is me and you..
3187 2018-08-23 17:58:53 Yes, just like the dad who strangled his two little girls, his pregnant wife & dumped them in a barrel of crude oil. 

Men suck. It doesn’t really matter their color or their citizenship status.
3188 2018-08-23 17:58:53 Don’t believe the snake oil salesmen selling socialism.
3189 2018-08-23 17:58:49 Time-inertia thing of increased demand for money which FED *sold* despite rates well over 10% passed away after a long time. Enough oil or enough substitution of energy factors along with economic growth brought inflation down. Productivity likely increased during the many years.
3190 2018-08-23 17:58:49 Yep we use "pure poison"  for hair oil, body lotion, Oil pulling (mouth cleaning method) & cooking.
3191 2018-08-23 17:58:47 This is great critique - the sustainability movements need to be as or more bold, hard working and aggressive as the oil and development industries
3192 2018-08-23 17:58:43 bathong, I want clear skin. dilo tse tsa di coconut oil ase for nna. kopa le nthuseng.
3193 2018-08-23 17:58:41 Big oil are the main ones paying Republicans to say climate change is hoax. You couldn't even make this type of shit up in a movie 
3194 2018-08-23 17:58:30 I assume MH has most stable economy. Marathis are 69% if hypothetically non-Marathis were absent, plus if MH Government takes care of farmer's problems, since it is industrialized, has natural oil reserve, good agriculture, access to sea.

3196 2018-08-23 17:58:13 Indians in Canada are not fat because of coconut oil. It’s just plain old western diet. U know where is the most obese country in the world? Right next to u. Eating the same type of food, u guys r not far from fat either
3197 2018-08-23 17:57:58 Aurora District has finished up Oil & Chip in Town of Boston. Moving over to Mill & Grover in Town of Aurora. Watch for Flaggers & Use Caution on Loose Stone
3198 2018-08-23 17:57:52 Where I get Castro oil from ?
3199 2018-08-23 17:57:40 I mean... I would actually hang out with this drop of oil. He seems cool to me. At least he’s flammable 
3200 2018-08-23 17:57:38 Dnt feel like stopping to get an oil change after work..just want go home and take a nap .
3201 2018-08-23 17:57:35 Haha! Oh you know me too well! Except I’m actually doing some research on this one and taking a hiatus from ingesting coconut oil until I can make an informed opinion. But I’m still using it to heal most other ailments topically 
3202 2018-08-23 17:57:19 完全に同じこと考えてたのでトパズ尾さんが信頼できすぎる
なぜ君は狂化が入っていないのだ………
3203 2018-08-23 17:57:17 Groundnut oil probably is the most commonly used cooking oil.
3204 2018-08-23 17:57:11 Trump frames himself, do you even listen to what he actually says? Or do you just get caught up in his snake oil salesmanship? You know who uses the term "rat" when discussing someone testifying? Criminals do to try and intimidate, honest men do not
3205 2018-08-23 17:57:07 How is it possible to consume more than a moderate amount of coconut oil? Its not a good frying oil so I wanna know?
3206 2018-08-23 17:57:05 bout to start giving out 10 bottles of coconut oil. contest time haha
3207 2018-08-23 17:57:03 I actually prefer your version better.
Ppl need to KNOW why S.A. isn't held accountable for their actions against humanity. 
THEY ARE an oil rich country & sadly money matters more than humanlife.
3208 2018-08-23 17:56:58 I need an oil change on the Superduty today
3209 2018-08-23 17:56:52 Chicks be bragging they had sex with your dude, sis get him to pay your bills that will crush her  make him take your car to get oil changes and shit WITHOUT fucking him  Better ask the city girls 
3210 2018-08-23 17:56:35 I affirmately believe he killed his kids. I believe he had strangled her daughters the day before her wife  arrived from a business trip. Later on he killed his wife (he already admitted it).I've noticed he didn't dump wife's corpse into tank oil as he did with his daughter.
3211 2018-08-23 17:56:27 girl these ppl so dumb I told they ass all I want is a oil change but I damn sure got these free window wipers & ac vents out they ass
3212 2018-08-23 17:56:23 You are such a racist!!!! What about the American mining and oil companies that murdered Africans? What about the Palestinians? Human Rights is for all Humans!!!!

3216 2018-08-23 17:56:08 s/o to my sister for setting up this free oil change & car wash for me 
3217 2018-08-23 17:55:56 The price of gasoline has nothing to do with who the US president is. That is until they decide to increase sanctions against Iran, effectively removing iranian oil supply on world market (remaining OPEC countries can’t simply increase production).
3218 2018-08-23 17:55:54 Coconut Oil may be poison now but I just drank a litre of coconut water and I’m still alive. Take that science!
3219 2018-08-23 17:55:52 あー、駄目だ。寝よう。良くないものが溢れ出てる
3220 2018-08-23 17:55:48 Presumably you've seen the recent coconut oil madness trending on Twitter?! 
3221 2018-08-23 17:55:44 This #CBD Oil is a Fabulous help for lots of people @jackie_mcgee #HempDay
3222 2018-08-23 17:55:42 Last slices of cheese have been devoured. Fat fast for a couple days with coconut oil, 100% cacao, water and coffee. Time to shed more weight. Be gone stagnation!
3223 2018-08-23 17:55:33 Women get a car & don’t check the oil, tire pressure, coolant, no nothing. They just wake up & drive that mf .
3224 2018-08-23 17:55:28 My apartment smells like a damn candy cane and my eyes are burning, but, if my eyes are burning that probably means the spider’s eyes are too and they will vacate the premises because everything here is now covered in peppermint oil.
3225 2018-08-23 17:55:26 Therefore no one in Canada will be able to market a generic "CBD oil" (without a health claim) in October. Only GW Pharma seems positioned to sell Epidiolex® brand  CBD for Lennox-Gastaut and Dravet syndromes

3228 2018-08-23 17:55:20 The oil on my face these days is enough to fry akara!
Somebody help!!

3229 2018-08-23 17:55:19 Right the economy is what I base where I live on. I sure hope all those poor folks in Houston were able to get all the oil & chemicals out of their houses.

3233 2018-08-23 17:54:58 He'll be singing praises of olive oil or refined oil...   But it's not the first time.... This was rampant in India during the early 90s
3234 2018-08-23 17:54:57 多様性は、種の生存確率を高める為の「手段」であり「目的」ではない。故に多様性は重要だが、多様性を目的と考えてる人とは意見が合わない。
3235 2018-08-23 17:54:53 I actually don't think he really believes what he says. He maybe 'hired' by Big Oil to spread negativity about Tesla. Typical wall street greedy asshole who cares about how much he has in the bank account and nothing more. He'd have definitely bought a Tesla if he was not hired.
3236 2018-08-23 17:54:49 In near future wars will be fought over water, not oil.
3237 2018-08-23 17:54:44 It is my considered opinion , based upon experience of surviving severe heart attack, kidney failure for 7 years that Cholesterol has very little role in CD ,Statin is poison , Coconut oil is Good , Desi Indian Ghee Heart protector

3239 2018-08-23 17:54:35 True that. They’ve been following the money trail for a while. All to do with russian sanctions, russian oil and gas oligarchs and property. From what I’ve read months ago, Roman abramovich could be in a spot of bother cos I’d company rosneft has been mentioned
3240 2018-08-23 17:54:32 Burning midnight oil even thought it's not worth it.
3241 2018-08-23 17:54:25 I am currenly eating grass-fed beef liver & onions cooked in coconut oil. Should be dead in a few hours, glad to read this before the end.
3242 2018-08-23 17:54:19 Oil of Olay is like $4-6 I think it's what I use!!
3243 2018-08-23 17:54:11 I think you need some oil film to blot away that shine.
3244 2018-08-23 17:54:11 Do they fry with it?  I guess cooking would heat it up just as much.  Anyway.  I’m gonna just cook/fry with peanut oil if I can afford it.  And I’m shopping at the dollar tree k!

Scot Gov is allocated over 100% of UK government revenues form North sea - rUK is tax revenue negative due to decommissioning/tax rebate effect (see GERS table 2.3)

you have been badly misinformed (maybe ask yourself why?)
3249 2018-08-23 17:53:52 Lol tension na lo use coconut oil, btw tbh underrated account bruh!
3250 2018-08-23 17:53:27 I must say... People who thought after his tweet that India really sends Crude oil world no 1,2,3 crude producer countries with just few crude oil well ie Aishwarya,Mangla....
3251 2018-08-23 17:53:23 kerosene oil...cooking stove जलाने के लिए 
3252 2018-08-23 17:53:23 Not even a layman  We have decades worth of oil, though weirdly, the amount & value always seems to be in inverse proportion to the proximity of Indy
3253 2018-08-23 17:53:20 Factor 15 ? You not a tan accelerator oil boy ?? 
3254 2018-08-23 17:53:17 Wait - I was just told coconut oil is what I should be using to cook with and in my lotions. Dang it!
3255 2018-08-23 17:53:08 What happened olive oil sale in india has gone down?? For centuries indians have been using coconut oil. Disgusting propaganda to finish indian products. Go away
3256 2018-08-23 17:53:06 -by and nobody wants to know more about it than the other guy and yet the Zapata Oil Drilling Services is more than just solving problems the Zapata Oil Drilling Services is more than just solving "alkanes and organic dysfunctional issues" and yet the Zapata Oiil Drilling Service
3257 2018-08-23 17:52:58 "the space force? what happened? did we find oil up there?"
3258 2018-08-23 17:52:58 I would be interested to know. Essentially lithium batteries are just liquid chemical. 

Wonder if that chemical has the same energetic capacity as oil.
3259 2018-08-23 17:52:32 Coconut oil is Ambrosia the nectar of life
If someone digs out which company is funding this guys harvard research. Then things will be Crystal clear
3260 2018-08-23 17:52:32 ข่มตานอนไม่ลง นึกถึงแต่พี่ดูจุน ฮือออ...
3261 2018-08-23 17:52:31 Ya heres a great idea put the literal tiniest person on fryers and then bitch at her when she can hardly lift and carry them hence spilling oil sometimes???
3262 2018-08-23 17:52:31 You can cook everything and anything with avocado oil.
3263 2018-08-23 17:52:29 I have MS. Was diagnosed and then a movie came out called Lorenzos Oil. My body is eating the fatty myelin in my brain that allows the nerves to accurately transmit signals. I vary my fats GREATLY.   Oils nuts seeds butter. Never one source only. I have the ass to prove it too!
3264 2018-08-23 17:52:18 I use coconut oil and other saturated fats on my ketogenic diet. My migraines  have gone and my lab work is better than it had been in years. I am almost 80.
3265 2018-08-23 17:52:11 Wow...what an eye opening article. I knew there was corruption, but geez. It always comes down to oil money and false advertising and grifters. Thanks for that Scotty!  That’s not our Dan Murphy from barrie?
3266 2018-08-23 17:52:11 ya think? Wait 'til they figure out the Broidy philandering case. Not to mention, Don Jr. just walks out on kids and wife. No wonder Don the Con doesn't mention the poor pregnant mother and her two daughters that were killed and stored in oil.
3267 2018-08-23 17:51:51 Sure it’s cool to make fun of the fact that every bar in Maryland outside of Baltimore is located in a strip mall until you’re stuck getting an oil change and realize you could go for a bar in a strip mall right now.
3268 2018-08-23 17:51:50 I think that if Arab oil countries wouldn't have had oil, they'd have had the same GDP of Algeria, Egypt, Tunisia, Yemen, Jordan etc.
3269 2018-08-23 17:51:48 Too hot in the Summer! And it's a lot of clean up. But coconut oil is great in Thai curry too!
3270 2018-08-23 17:51:45 Kai. This Efo Riro has the perfect vegetable to oil ratio.... Pls when exactly might you be visiting Abuja in the nearest future??
3271 2018-08-23 17:51:44 I accuse Colonel Chili oil of committing the crime in the in the tower with the dagger!
3272 2018-08-23 17:51:34 thats chilli oil to make it spicy
3273 2018-08-23 17:51:27 That olive oil seeping into the bread 
3274 2018-08-23 17:51:20 No I’m pretty sure it’s fine for white people too. It’s just that the professora gave a lecture without any research probably coz she was asked to by industries paying her. Canola oil companies may be?
3275 2018-08-23 17:51:10 Honey, you didn't discover snake oil. This and many like it, have been around for decades.

3277 2018-08-23 17:50:57 i gotta go get an oil change today 
3278 2018-08-23 17:50:51 This oil change gonna cost me an arm and a leg but I get free Starbucks .... or am I paying for it in that price  haha
3279 2018-08-23 17:50:41 Del 26 al 28 de marzo del 2019, Tabasco será la sede del primer Expo Oil & Gas, con el que se buscará atraer una derrama superior a los 25 millones de pesos.
3280 2018-08-23 17:50:36 If you put a tbsp of it on top of abt a 1/3 cup of nutella, microwave for a few seconds to liquify the oil & then mix it together, it makes hardshell nutella ice cream topping...and it's delicious (but, I know now, poisonous)
3281 2018-08-23 17:50:36 Oil and gas
3282 2018-08-23 17:50:15 Get on of those essential oil defusers, and stick coffee in.
3283 2018-08-23 17:50:10 I am doing a lot of dumb "adulting" shit today-- getting my oil changed, trying to get my water turned on my new place, verifying my venmo account ETC.

It's making me really agro to have to talk/work with these folks today. At least pawn stars is on at the shop tho?
3284 2018-08-23 17:50:05 Property investment opportunities as well oil opportunities in Ghana as well...
3285 2018-08-23 17:50:02 Texas also runs a lot of solar and wind. Why only point out the oil?  Oh yeah, your donors. They only people you deem worthy of having a conversation with.
3286 2018-08-23 17:49:59 I repurpose the bags for all kinds of things. Small trash can liners, scoop cat litter into, empty used vegetable oil into after frying... I'm gonna miss those bags.
3287 2018-08-23 17:49:56 Winnie the Pooh got the oil! 
3288 2018-08-23 17:49:55 Don't have time now...but tons of studies show the cultures who rely on coconut oil have zero heart disease. It, real butter, and palm oil are the only oils that do not go rancid when cooking. Olive oil is great as a dressing but goes rancid at high temps.
3289 2018-08-23 17:49:55 It's the oil! We will let them kill millions for it too!
3290 2018-08-23 17:49:48 No one will buy this research at all. We have been doing well for ages by consuming coconut oil and ghee.

3292 2018-08-23 17:49:46 Why does coconut oil stink so much 
3293 2018-08-23 17:49:41 So I r saying all the Indians who used coconut oil for literally thousands of years are just survivors of coconut poisoning??! U know what’s proven science? A practical test lab of millions of people over thousands of years. Not a random lecture.
3294 2018-08-23 17:49:39 Someone comes forward to rescue olive oil.
3295 2018-08-23 17:49:34 Again conspiracy against coconuts n coconut oil.

3298 2018-08-23 17:48:55 I too ingested Cannabis that made me sick. But it was a pesticide used while growing it.

@CannTrust is making #CannabisOil for pets.  My kitty lived pain free the last 2 years of her life thanks to mild oil I made.

3303 2018-08-23 17:48:47 maybe that's why they'v gotten the Harvard prof to say that coconut oil is evil?

For all the trolls, almost nobody responded to your tweets.
3308 2018-08-23 17:48:26 I live in Odessa/midland and have lived in the area my whole life and this article just isn't true. I work in the oil and gas industry have for 9 years. DM for info. Sure, it's possible to make 100k but you need a lot more than a drivers license and a pulse to do so.
3309 2018-08-23 17:48:23 Then what are you and PP upset at? The market is doing its thing. It is simply uneconomical to ship bitumen 5000 kms in the midst of these low prices and with the shale oil boom going on

Th whole suggestion is disingenuous virtue signalling to low information conservatives.
3310 2018-08-23 17:48:21 I eaty dries with mayo sometimes, gravy or ranch other times.
I have eaten them with oil & vinegar, with mojo. 
Hot sauce or guacamole. I will continue to eat them with whatever condiment I'm in the mood for. Hotdogs are spicy mustard & sauerkraut! If a burger is good, no sauce.
3311 2018-08-23 17:48:06 Don't worry, a pastor will soon come perform Miracles for you.

You really sat down and expected all these promises to materialize despite oil prices falling to 28$ per barrel?? 

You're not logical in your thinking.... at all.
3312 2018-08-23 17:47:54 So why all the oil pipelines lier
3313 2018-08-23 17:47:51 Another propaganda to discourage people from reaping the benefits of coconut oil.
Looks like coconut oil is working wonders for many westerners and hence the need to peddle such BS.
Also saw #NDTV sharing the same news  Another reason to skip this poisonous article!
3314 2018-08-23 17:47:49 Totally agree!
Civilized countries will only wreck a country for oil.
3315 2018-08-23 17:47:37 Return, maybe the data you are lokking at is AGW scam by some people how lose money on their oil and coal Company.
3316 2018-08-23 17:47:27 if you get the hair oil he now uses you can even know how it smells :))))))

I'm not ok...
3317 2018-08-23 17:47:07 It's also a fact that inflation is an effect of external issues, generally more so than internal....the discovery of North Sea oil played a huge hand in turning our fortunes around. Wouldn't have mattered which party was in power, because the inflation wasn't policy driven
3318 2018-08-23 17:47:01 Coconut Oil is GREATTTTTT
3319 2018-08-23 17:47:00  pour a motor oil out for the homies
3320 2018-08-23 17:46:56 I don’t disagree with you on any of that: my point is that the current regulations have loopholes you could drive an oil tanker through. Being “reasonably well informed”, observant and circumspect is, sadly, insufficient - suggesting a need to change the law.
3321 2018-08-23 17:46:54 Sleep is a tremeeeeendous factor that doesn’t get takes about enough. It’s literally changing the oil in the car - if it doesn’t happen right the car doesn’t run optimally.

3328 2018-08-23 17:46:25 Because some professor said doesnot make coconut oil bad. The same way they said salt , neem , ashes, lavang are harmful to teeth. Now we have seen tooth paste companies adding them to their product.
3329 2018-08-23 17:46:24 
my parents are pretty well off and me and my sister who drives were both given our first cars, but neither of them were very nice and we were responsible for things like paying for gas and oil changes. we were still definitely lucky though!!

3334 2018-08-23 17:45:44 Best guess? Somebody somewhere got offended by someone who was into homeopathy and decided to take it out on the most current craze. Coconut Oil.
3335 2018-08-23 17:45:41 It's big news when an illegal immigrant does something wrong, but what happened to this guy US CITIZEN that killed his two daughters and his pregnant wife?. He dump his daughters in an oil well and barrried his wife in a shallow grave. Trump and followers are very quite about it.

3338 2018-08-23 17:45:11 There is huge fad for coconut oil in US grocery stores. This looks like a blow against that from the lard and vegetable oil industry.

3346 2018-08-23 17:43:53 Nah I get that I'm a big health and fitness guy. But over the years ironically this is the best thing my body took to. I could always switch to more olive oil over time but the effects and benefits of high fat low carb diets are certainly beneficial to many people :)
3347 2018-08-23 17:43:50 Lmaoooooo why will I block you na? When I started cooking the stew, the oil wasn’t enough, added a little n bam it’s much, had to leave it like that. N I’m not Yoruba

3371 2018-08-23 17:41:33 Depends how much you drive. Most premium oil recommends around 15000 miles.
3372 2018-08-23 17:41:21 I do the olive oil test where you put  a glass of it in the refrigerator to see if it gets thick and cloudy. That is how you know it is pure. only the best!

In India, from several centuries #CononutOil is used and people are healthy.
3402 2018-08-23 17:39:01 India exports refined oil to nepal, sri lanka as they haven't any refinery. They have signed a pact by which India exports oil duty free and IOC is the only in SL that provided fuel. So this fool congress is God level fool.
3403 2018-08-23 17:38:58 Nothing new in any of that. As you say Sarah. Olive oil, butter and quality lard.

3410 2018-08-23 17:38:43 people can eat coconut oil and be healthy if the rest of their diet is healthy and they are active
3411 2018-08-23 17:38:42 Lastly, truth needs to be told about this proposed pipeline. It's not for Canadian consumption, so no benefit there. It's being sold to China, who, with the completion of the LOOP port in Louisiana, have ordered 83 supertankers which can take 4x the oil from the LOOP port at 1/2

3417 2018-08-23 17:37:42 Even with the price of brent oil doubling last year ,scotland still had a huge fiscal deficit. Even though alec salmond told us we would all be rich with "oor oil" money. Scotland dodged a bullet 4 years ago. We are all older and wiser now.

Let cool & cut into croutons and bake for another 10 mins until crispy w/small bit of oil
3420 2018-08-23 17:37:37 Commission sales? That would definitely work. You could always do that and save till you can open a shop! OR do your sales job and do small mechanic jobs on the side like oil change or whatever and save that $$$ for a shop
3421 2018-08-23 17:37:36 for having vape oil in texaskfnsbsb
3422 2018-08-23 17:37:35 A Harvard professor is making claims that coconut oil is “pure poison”. Confirming once and for all that my body is straight lethal.
3423 2018-08-23 17:37:29 I use it mostly for hair and skin. I go for the olive oil for cooking.
3424 2018-08-23 17:37:26 Study was probably Sponsored by rapeseed oil manufacturers.  Harvard studies are very flawed these days and are money/lobby driven.
3425 2018-08-23 17:37:24 Take the oil and wealth off them and they’re just Islamic State... Simple as that.
3426 2018-08-23 17:37:22 TIrene Muloni, ministre du développement énergétique et minéral de l’Ouganda, prendra la tête d’une délégation d’acteurs privés et publics du secteur pétrolier et gazier ougandais à l’Africa Oil Week 2018 qui se tiendra du 5 au 9 novembre 2018 au Cap, en Afrique du Sud.
3427 2018-08-23 17:37:22 Oh for fuck sake your not in the chip oil again
3428 2018-08-23 17:37:19 もがわァ
3429 2018-08-23 17:37:18 I use it every other oil change & can tell the difference #STP
3430 2018-08-23 17:37:15 Tea tree oil worked wonders for me.
3431 2018-08-23 17:37:01 Still trying to understand where  exactly the oil washed up on the shores of central and northern Mississippi. The coast is where the BP disaster hit and that is where the money should stay! #MSleg
3432 2018-08-23 17:36:52 Easy =\= cheap. You also gotta figure, oil and gas companies are not going to be convinced it's a good idea. They have so much money sunk into the stuff as it is right now, and they like being rich.
3433 2018-08-23 17:36:49 Banda jamiya ka oil ya naswar wala thook laga k Reham khan ko pechay se karay...
3434 2018-08-23 17:36:48 You suppose to tip on oil changes?
3435 2018-08-23 17:36:46 Well that sucked! I just waited 5 hours for an oil change with an 8:30am appointment that they bumped from last week. Very poor @goodyear in Ocean Pines Never again #wastedtime #frustrated
3436 2018-08-23 17:36:43 Rats are bigger, lettuce is crunchier, butter is fat-based margarine is oil based.
3437 2018-08-23 17:36:31 'Cool comparison' that doesn't answer the question at hand. Is coconut oil healthy? "Well mcdonalds ". 
Coconut oil increases your LDL. Simple fact.
3438 2018-08-23 17:36:28 The oil bigwig stated "Instead we now have entire streets in Glasgow closed off at the request of one religion over another." Wrong it was thedecent people of Scotland that have had enough bigotry! We don’t want your marches!
3439 2018-08-23 17:36:26 報われてくれ
3440 2018-08-23 17:36:24 It's not something that should be eaten in mass quantities, by itself. No. But then again, no oil should. Oil is one of the things you should be consuming the least of. 

But it does add a an extra complexity to cetain dishes. Lol.
3441 2018-08-23 17:36:22 When I went to college for engineering, we neither had the time nor the effort to worry about this stupidity. We were trying to pass while taking 18-21 credits each semester. This is stupid bullshit.
3442 2018-08-23 17:36:16 He obviously hasn’t had enough Beatles tracks.
3443 2018-08-23 17:36:16 I can't imagine eating coconut oil. We used it to make lipstick in a makeup chemistry set my daughter got. I'd use it on skin but I wouldn't ingest it.
3444 2018-08-23 17:36:13 うぬ
3445 2018-08-23 17:36:11 I still let my mom oil my scalp 
3446 2018-08-23 17:36:10 Nope. I seriously thought it was a topical thing only. Question though, doesn't pretty much any kind of oil raise cholesterol?
Even olive oil to a minor degree.
3447 2018-08-23 17:36:09 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
3448 2018-08-23 17:36:06 But a barrel of oil is equal to about 1700 kWh.. a tanker can carry 2,000,000 barrels of oil. How big of a capacitor would you need to contain 3,400,000,000 kWh? And to not lose any of that during the journey and storage?
3449 2018-08-23 17:36:03 ‘Thank you for the Oil money’ over the Etihad
3450 2018-08-23 17:35:53 Yeah but you have the "Caviar and Truffle Oil: Apollo 14 Moon Rock encrusted" limited edition console. You're keeping that part a secret sir.
3451 2018-08-23 17:35:48 I can’t believe you mention the garlic scene from Goodfellas!! I always think of how he slices it with a razor blade in prison. I have taken to using a garlic press—releases the juice of the garlic into the oil.
3452 2018-08-23 17:35:46 Lol at everyone freaking out at the Harvard professor who said coconut oil is "poison." (Because it's pretty much 100% saturated fats)

"I really love using this product, so I'm gonna act like I'm an expert and disagree!!"

Not how life works, but yet....

God we are doomed.
3453 2018-08-23 17:35:31 THE US-CHINA SHOWDOWN CAN'T BE SOLVED W/ AN AGREEMENT BUT BREAKING UP THE DECK OF CARDS
It'll force #China/#Taiwan to deleverage selling off the assets acquired to influence the: oil,gas,satellites,...

3455 2018-08-23 17:35:20 My first car burned some oil but she survived even though I had no idea what I was doing. At one point there was only 1/3 off oil left. It was a fiat punto 1,0 so not a big high performance car but still. Pretty impressive and I learned a lot about having and taking care of a car
3456 2018-08-23 17:35:15 You have yet to meet those Arabian oil money dudes.
3457 2018-08-23 17:35:13 Are you referring to the oil on canvas one of jobless folks queueing at the Jobcentre?
3458 2018-08-23 17:35:13 Mam, it's a turn to introduce new oil in South East India like they introduced wheat, corn and potato. They are the biggest producers, we are the biggest consumers! 
This time may be olive oil or it can be palm oil. Whole South American forests are converted into palm oil plantat
3459 2018-08-23 17:35:09 What if it works?

If you can hedge it, which due to the credit risk of PTR is specious, but if you could, oil is basically as good as a dollar. It's dollarization on a commodity base.
3460 2018-08-23 17:35:08 Brilliant
3461 2018-08-23 17:35:04 Oil
3462 2018-08-23 17:35:01 おい
3463 2018-08-23 17:35:00 I think coconut oil has more benefits than bad effects. I am not sure about the published research report. We have years of good experience gor generations.
3464 2018-08-23 17:34:57 government-funded climate change preparation but only for big oil hmmmm
3465 2018-08-23 17:34:56 Women get a car & don’t check the oil, tire pressure, coolant, no nothing. They just wake up & drive that mf .

3468 2018-08-23 17:34:29 First of all , india don't export any crude oil to any country. And see those examples.. US, Iraq,UAE  even an illiterate can tell @rssurjewala that India import crude from these countries. India exports refined products.  1/2
3469 2018-08-23 17:34:26 • 2 spoon of olive oil 
• 1 spoonful of honey
• 1 spoon of coconut oil
• 1 egg yolk

Mix everything together, apply to your hair and let stand overnight. Rinse the next day, mask to be done once a week.
3470 2018-08-23 17:34:20 How much Scottish oil money pours into the English exchequer every year?
That would really cut down on that imaginative £13.4bn!
3471 2018-08-23 17:34:18 They better catch me next time. Trying to get a bitch for 700 more dollars. Took 2 hours for just the damn oil change. They better leave me alone!
3472 2018-08-23 17:34:16 We need report card ...where is smart city ,black money ..dollar vs rupee , engineers are unemplyed due to wrong  policy ,due to oil price down thousand of engineers became unemplyed and 100 of companies business down ....but govt.did not taken any step for unemplyment
3473 2018-08-23 17:34:11 When you get home from work to find the carpenter oiling the hinges of your new folding doors with spendy @Brindisa olive oil.
3474 2018-08-23 17:34:09 Natural oils, like argon, coconut, even almond or olive oil. Stay away from oils that have a first ingredient of petroleum.
3475 2018-08-23 17:34:04 Oh please. Spare me the usual boring diatribe. Oil still is plentiful Mr FBPE. Interesting how the arsey tweets on this subject today, have all had #FBPE after their name...
3476 2018-08-23 17:34:03 Though now you've got me thinking about the physics of frying in space. 

Gravity's an obvious barrier. Low pressure affects water boiling which changes the interaction between oil and food, but you can still get the oil to temp.

I'd guess the big problem is aerosolized oil?

3481 2018-08-23 17:33:40 This coconut oil drama is bound to lower Harvard’s ranking. The funny thing is scientists make these broad claims, not acknowledging that what may be bad for one ethnic group based on genetic makeup could be incredible for another.

3488 2018-08-23 17:33:00 not sure that coconut oil is poison but any substance that's 80% saturated fats is not going to be good for you and certainly not a "health food"
3489 2018-08-23 17:33:00 Harvard professor must know that Southern part of India uses more coconut oil but has lesser heart related problems as compared to USA. MNC edible oil exporters nexus can't be ruled out to demean Indian indigeneous products to increase export of their products.
3490 2018-08-23 17:32:55 Should’ve served more oil tbh
3491 2018-08-23 17:32:50 One of the Canadian provinces have been trying to twin an oil pipeline through the temperate forests in British Columbia. The federal courts threw out the last main appeal against the pipeline today. It’s going to effect many ecosystems and animal and marine life
3492 2018-08-23 17:32:42 Right? How can you screw up a recepy that's essentially eggs, mustard, oil, vinegar and salt?
3493 2018-08-23 17:32:28 What I've learned from {paid for} conventional wisdom:

Coconut oil is poison.
Low carb diets take off years of your life.
Sugar should be in your diet.
Full fat causes heart attacks.
Smoking isn't THAT bad.
Red meat raises cholesterol and cancer risks.

@robbwolf @chriskresser
3494 2018-08-23 17:32:23 How many billions in profits do these oil companies make each year? Why can't they finance most of their own protections?
3495 2018-08-23 17:32:16 IMO Watergate just coincidental with the massive 73/74 recession caused by the Arab Oil Embargo with a severe oil shortage in a highly industrialize economy like the USA.

I had leave the country to find work in the North Sea oil industry.
3496 2018-08-23 17:32:13 Why is Twitter showing me ads for snake oil?
3497 2018-08-23 17:32:07 There is no better nutritionist than our grandparents and parents who have been using it sonce years.. maybe the harvard professor has plans to promote some other oil.. so such statements..
3498 2018-08-23 17:32:01 A dude who smelled heavily of oil and asphalt came into the store and I got an instant headache. Thanks guy. 
3499 2018-08-23 17:31:36 And that the general age of folks with money (the ones allowing snake oil to be produced) are not in the bracket described by millenial

3505 2018-08-23 17:31:17 This literally happened to me last week. I asked for an oil change fee and they gave me a list for 870 that needs fixed 
3506 2018-08-23 17:31:15 What was the point of making an appointment @meinekecarcare , almost two hours later I’m still waiting for my oil change to be finished
3507 2018-08-23 17:31:07 I want to oil this rocking chair or even better, throw it out. Getting on my damn nerves.
3508 2018-08-23 17:30:48 Still tinkering with the idea of soap dough. I don’t use tallow, lard, or palm oil so it’s a bit of a challenge! #soapdough #soap #soapmaking #handmade #artisan
3509 2018-08-23 17:30:47 No... It looks like her uninformed opinion. Having the name Harvard attached to it means little. Look @ the Twit thread, ppl point out the time they pushed sugar is good&fat bad propaganda. If theres study, have to look at who funded it. Veg oil companies? Sales losing 2 coconut?
3510 2018-08-23 17:30:46 Stir together 4 tsps celery with 9 tsps corn. Mix into  Olive Oil. Allow to harden Serve on bread
3511 2018-08-23 17:30:42 Lavender oil really helps my skin!
3512 2018-08-23 17:30:41 Harvard claims are followed by a large group of medical companies and pharma too..
Pathetic that our indian medical BUSINESS follow them too.
Now coconut oil..After few years they will say the opposite putting blame on so called

3513 2018-08-23 17:30:36 Apparently not Adrian oh well.  I can go with the old Heid, but I am not poor.  Come on spill the beans
3514 2018-08-23 17:30:35 come on I been out all afternonn BLCL or whatever his name is left Adrian off his list of bffs.  So am I right in guessing BLCL is actually big Adrian.  How the hell was I to know

3516 2018-08-23 17:30:25 Ugh. I avoid articles in which the hyperbole is right there in the title. Assuming coconut oil is bad (which is highly debatable), it certainly is not “pure poison.” Strychnine is pure poison.
3517 2018-08-23 17:30:18 The self elevation of his relevancy is astounding: You don't grow crops or raise cattle, drill for oil, build or maintain machinery heal the sick or stand in harms way against our foes. Do you build homes or hospitals? YOU ARE A STOOGE, a JESTER and a fool!

Meanwhile there are over 300 forrest fires raging in BC with climate change as a likely cause. :(

3529 2018-08-23 17:29:27 May I suggest to soak it in milk? Perhaps that will help? Heat-detecting neural sensors are sending a message straight to the brain: "fire!" Milk, however, contains casein, a fat-loving compound that binds with spicy capsaicin oil which washes it away.

- cast iron cauldron (mines tiny and it was like...$20? it's worth it tho. it's a legit tool)
- white sage, other herbs
- if you want a CLOUD of smoke, drop a SINGLE DROP of essential oil in that shit and it will PUFF UP
3557 2018-08-23 17:27:29 ฮืออ สู้ๆนะ
3558 2018-08-23 17:27:22 You not get any squirrel oil? Need to keep that sidearm oiled up, might want to adjust the sights, can't afford any more missed shots or ricochets
3559 2018-08-23 17:27:18 Every time I get my oil changed it’s a shitty fucking day

3561 2018-08-23 17:27:09 February 27 I started LCHF diet, and have use alot of coconut oil since.  My cholesterol was in normal range for first time in 15 years.  I say it's ok.
3562 2018-08-23 17:26:48 Coconut oil is cancelled now?
3563 2018-08-23 17:26:47 No, not an oil exec? Better luck this time.
3564 2018-08-23 17:26:38 They really drew her like she listened to that one (1) Harvard professor that said coconut oil is "pure poison"
3565 2018-08-23 17:26:31 i got the low-box with the know better and quest cookies, which are made with both coconut flour AND oil lmao
3566 2018-08-23 17:26:27 the obvious hate of the left and democrats against Trump is why many independents are supporting @realDonaldTrump right now. It's so ridiculous they can't get him for phony Russia collusion they want to get him for anything else. Never gonna happen

3569 2018-08-23 17:26:06 Hard to digest. Coconut oil for treatment of filarial chyluria as it contains Medium chain fatty acid
3570 2018-08-23 17:25:59 I hate having to get my car fixed. I hate waiting and anything besides an oil change takes forever
3571 2018-08-23 17:25:52 i get olive oil at the grocery store here

3573 2018-08-23 17:25:32 I’ve recently switched out my lotion for coconut oil and wowowow my skin has never been this soft!
3574 2018-08-23 17:25:27 I'm also a big fan of the Blackhawks and enjoy cooking, should we argue about whether or not Crawford will have a comeback this season or if truffle oil is a cop out as well? Or shall we stick to Mcfauls admitting he refuses to research his friends?
3575 2018-08-23 17:25:20 I have only 3 at the moment. Actual perfumes and not perfume oil or any of those impostor shit
3576 2018-08-23 17:25:15 Edibles. Thc oil. 
Small doses, get a lil silly.
Get fella hungry.
3577 2018-08-23 17:25:02 Im at the car dealership getting an oil change and i can hear my car keys being played with. And im in the waiting room getting hungry and i just want my car back now
3578 2018-08-23 17:25:01 There’s no gas shortage, man. It’s all fake. The oil companies control everything. Like there’s this guy who invented this car that runs on water, man. It’s got a fiberglass, air-cooled engine, and it runs on WATER.
3579 2018-08-23 17:24:57 Lets build a pipeline thru a province that has had 5 of its worst years for forest fires since 2010, & will probably continue that trend.  Let’s support expansion of oil sands when we are increasingly experiencing the results of climate change due in large part to fossil fuel use
3580 2018-08-23 17:24:51 Me and my girlfriend have been on keto for a while now. She's down 28lbs never felt better, doctor says her levels are good as well. Every five years what's healthy changes. With how good I've felt after switching to the higher fat (including coconut oil) I think I'll ride it out
3581 2018-08-23 17:24:44 One is a new road and the other is a reconstruction. You would guess that Nigeria as an oil producing country has more Asphalt at least and Butimen exists in Abundance in Ondo area
3582 2018-08-23 17:24:40 Saturated fats like coconut oil, ghee etc are more harmful than unsaturated oil like olive oil. It's not poison but relatively more harmful. No doubt about it
3583 2018-08-23 17:24:35 WTI oil unchanged at $67.88/barrel.
3584 2018-08-23 17:24:33 Yup and canola oil is perfectly fine. No issues with that all #merica
3585 2018-08-23 17:24:31 It's all about the oil.
3586 2018-08-23 17:24:30 Need to increase my medications as much. Bcuz of marijuana I have only gone up 10mgs in 14yrs.  Cannabis is a miracle drug. My goal is to one day be off Opioids all together & just use herbal medication (Rick Simpson oil)
3587 2018-08-23 17:24:25 Le gouvernement de l’Ouganda encourage les projets pétroliers et gaziers lors de l’édition 2018 de l’Africa Oil Week.

3588 2018-08-23 17:24:15 Interesting, I'm a planning engineer, the firm I would for buys advanced kit & builds complex gas plants & oil refineries all over the world. I studied geography at Uni of Liverpool & fully understand the global economy & geopolitics. The EU is a neoliberal corporatist empire. X
3589 2018-08-23 17:24:13 That ending was pretty great. Good luck on this one... it should make the work done on the Lambo feel like a quick oil change.
3590 2018-08-23 17:24:03 When my daddy teach me how to change my own oil, ima talk to you niggas Any kinda way 
3591 2018-08-23 17:24:01 LOL. I don't like American mayonnaise, but I would argue that aoili (fresh eggs mixed w/ olive oil) IS delicious on fries. I encountered it for the first time in France.
3592 2018-08-23 17:23:59 Wild growth oil definitely has crack in it. Idk if it’s Gina’s hair crack or just crack but it’s in there.
3593 2018-08-23 17:23:56 Dude is insufferable
3594 2018-08-23 17:23:55 i meant cod liver oil
3595 2018-08-23 17:23:47 why would i change my oil when i can just drop it off to jiffy lube and get it done there
3596 2018-08-23 17:23:47 @C60redlion is there a way to just use ONLY ultrasound for C60 or pulver. C60 to be dissolved in oil? Or does it need to be (followed) by 7 stirring after ultrasound? Thanks much!
3597 2018-08-23 17:23:45 The best way to deal with climate change is to stop contributing to it.  Stop drilling, fracking, refining, using fossil fuels. We can't just deal with the aftermath of disasters, that won't stop the next disaster. when was the last time big oil actually paid for a clean up?
3598 2018-08-23 17:23:40 Getting a oil change they tell me I need tires and a new battery. 
3599 2018-08-23 17:23:36 I'm so jealous! I wish I could try CBD oil in combo with my #opioids. It's grounds for immediate dismissal from the pain clinic though.
3600 2018-08-23 17:23:33 Are you my twin?

I swear I could have written ALL THIS. First, I reacted to MCT oil most use. Then I HATED the way THC made me feel (my head is trippy enough). Can't smoke it, only vape and my lungs can't do it.

CBD did nothing but knock me out. $1000 oop, no pain meds now 
3601 2018-08-23 17:23:27 Man jay and donating milk had left me w sand bags up until i found out your breast’s get fuller when you massage them with pure virgin olive oil. Like the real kind
3602 2018-08-23 17:23:24 Isn't snake oil what you get when you cold press a snake?
3603 2018-08-23 17:23:21 Baby  if I break your heart na oil spillages
3604 2018-08-23 17:23:20 Maybe not reverse widely accepted measures to curb the impact, for starters. Then again big oil won't like that so evermind.
3605 2018-08-23 17:23:16 BP's local manager in Durango said today "Regulations in and of itself is not an issue." He said oil and gas have worked well with community in La Plata County, as opposed to other areas around the country.
3606 2018-08-23 17:23:16 80% of the fats in coconut oil are saturated fats - butter only has 63% saturated fats. Put down that coconut oil, slowly back away and eat a stick of butter instead - It's much better for you
3607 2018-08-23 17:23:12 Similar have a friend from Pacific Islands who has always avoided coconut milk/ oil for the same reasons. 
Lost a lot of people to heart attacks :(
3608 2018-08-23 17:23:07 Cute dogs! That's a great question.  If you want to take extra precaution, use organic insecticides (insecticidal soap, neem oil). We've tested Garden Safe Insecticidal Soap and Bonide Neem Oil. Both products worked well as contact sprays (be sure to spray SLF directly!)
3609 2018-08-23 17:22:53 Making up Sci by throwing words around and making up stories to fit it together is pathetic... Just because U heard the word "convection" does not make man made GW fake, it just means oil Co is getting desperate

3612 2018-08-23 17:22:38 Ahhh already rolled them out. The bowl after proving had oil resting on the top. Must have been pushed out. But it absorbed fine when rolling. I’ll take a picture when made.

3614 2018-08-23 17:22:29 If I have one more patient ask me about this "Harvard researcher says Coconut Oil is Poison in viral video", I'm going to blow a gasket. #newrules -To post a news item pertaining to nutrition science you should have to demostrate BASIC scientific literacy.
3615 2018-08-23 17:22:29 I’ll wash, blow out, braid down (slightly oil scalp), and custom your wig/ frontal/ closure all for free
3616 2018-08-23 17:22:13 Pretty sure those aren't medications. Sound like "natural remedies"--or as medical experts call them, snake oil. 
Google: "King Bio develops and manufactures water-based homeopathic medicines and supplements for human and companion-animal health"
Especially homeopathy, total BS.
3617 2018-08-23 17:22:10 Basically as far as I know Canola Oil is more refined to remove the toxic contents of rape seed. And It’s great for frying. And good for the heart (which was the complaint about rapeseed)
3618 2018-08-23 17:22:10 Might actually work in the oil field....
3619 2018-08-23 17:22:02 Where can I find some beard oil ?
3620 2018-08-23 17:21:58 It’s not even Scientology is based on pseudoscience and snake oil
3621 2018-08-23 17:21:52 A white guy, a citizen, strangled his two baby girls and his wife the other day, and dumped their bodies in an oil tank.  Didn't hear a peep from 45 or Madison about that one.  Just keep distracting his with crimes by brown folks so they don't see he's a criminal as well.
3622 2018-08-23 17:21:50 First they said “Ghee” is poison & now it’s proved that “Ghee” is only beneficial & it has no harmful effect. Now coconut oil! But they don’t talk about very harmful effect of sugar because of strong sugar lobby!
3623 2018-08-23 17:21:49 Go on. Publish how much coconut oil (pure poison) enough to kill.
3624 2018-08-23 17:21:48 All except Sunflower oil plus home made Desi Ghee
3625 2018-08-23 17:21:45 Some people use CBD oil to treat anorexia  

Most CBD oils have under 0.3% so it shouldn't get you *high*, regular THC products have about 5-20% for comparison. 

Also that sounds delicous, I love CTC
3626 2018-08-23 17:21:45 Thank you! I make the marinade with equal-ish parts: peanut butter, tamari, tamarind paste, tomato paste, tahini oil, lime juice and garlic chili sauce.

3628 2018-08-23 17:21:41 What am I going to do with 65 cases of coconut oil??? 
3629 2018-08-23 17:21:40 Full disclosure, I use coconut oil all the time. Sometimes I will even eat a spoon of it because I like it. But my goal is to not die because of cardiovascular disease. So I need to be careful.

3636 2018-08-23 17:21:18 Genuinely believe the most effective way to get NeoLibs to support sustainability would be to play up how the loss of oil revenue would harm the Middle East.
3637 2018-08-23 17:21:00 Unlikely because we don't have sufficient oil reserves to give the US deep state motivation enough to wage a covert war against our 'regime' in order to change the regime and inflict another devastating tsunami of disaster capitalism - do keep up.
Stick to fubol and acdc 
3638 2018-08-23 17:20:55 Everybody want a foreign car until you realize how much premium gas cost.. oil changes $100.. new tires $120 A TIRE.. etc

My chain came off about 3 miles in. I managed, without being a turbo mong to get it back together. 

Although. I am now covered in oil. So I do look like a turbo mong. 

Tomorrow I’m going to go for the mega hard route. 10 more miles. More hills.

3646 2018-08-23 17:19:54 Bowl of any well seasoned meat and rice, throw spinach on top - bit of olive oil herbs, soy sauce or coconut amino sauce.  Slow cook and season meat with herbs
3647 2018-08-23 17:19:41 I need an oil change already  ugh
3648 2018-08-23 17:19:40 Lmao Harvard be like, “coconut oil is poison!!!!!!!!!” but every South Asian’s just like, “hold my beer”
3649 2018-08-23 17:19:23 Olive oil drops work like a charm, they should have them over the counter at any pharmacy, at least here. Then after a few days you flush while showering. It's safe but takes a while. Whatever you do don't use anything solid, I did and paid the price...
3650 2018-08-23 17:19:16 Sometimes my love of food runs so deep it's too much. I just broke a bottle of olive oil I bought yesterday and I am SO SAD. REALLY

3653 2018-08-23 17:19:02 I’m not justifying that, I think it’s terrible, but at the executive level of federal government life is cheap and they care more about lowering the price of oil than they do saving peoples’ lives.
3654 2018-08-23 17:18:40 Is coconut oil really healthier to cook with or is that a myth?
3655 2018-08-23 17:18:38 おまおまおまおまおまおま
3656 2018-08-23 17:18:36 Or have three just bs to make ends meet!! Sen. Lankford has NO idea how the employment world works.  Wages are pitiful!  Many employers cut hours to make folks part-time w/no benefits, no HRC, so are forced to do 2 or 3 jobs.Oil donors are god in OK 2 the detriment of all!

3658 2018-08-23 17:18:25 Have you ever tried using essential oils? I’ve used cotton balls and peppermint oil around my house and it keeps them at bay!
3659 2018-08-23 17:18:24 i’m unable to smoke blunts , joints , bowls , etc anymore due to anxiety. but i’m able to smoke an oil pen. at least i found something that actually doesn’t induce anxiety.
3660 2018-08-23 17:18:02 @JoeRogan and his love for coconut oil... MCTs will never the LCTs like olive oil. Plus, if @JoeRogan is such an advocate of low-carb 'dieting' than why promote coconut oil? MCTs don't need a process to pass through the mitochondria. Your body treats them like carbs, and that...
3661 2018-08-23 17:17:54 you use it to cook, like you would olive oil or butter lol
3662 2018-08-23 17:17:51 I love how Ontario and Alberta are allowed to dictate what happens to lands and waterways in British Columbia. The #TransMountain decision is devastating from an environmental stand point. Sure, you can transport your oil quicker, but we’re the ones who will suffer for it #Joke
3663 2018-08-23 17:17:51 Well, I guess I’m died from coconut oil and no one told me #ketolife #ketodiet
3664 2018-08-23 17:17:50 Well I don't know, I might change plans and go to DenFur on Saturday instead of Friday.  My car has been getting repairs done and I don't want to put off the alignment scheduled tomorrow and I might also need an oil change.  A working car is a higher priority for me right now.
3665 2018-08-23 17:17:44 Comparing relative tax income from oil from dependent Scotland and independent Norway is an interesting one as well. Looks like little Norway gets a lot more bang for its buck there than Scotland does under UK.
3666 2018-08-23 17:17:40 @chriskresser @foundmyfitness are you seeing this about coconut oil? The professor from Harvard who called it pure poison because of saturated fatty acids? Can you clear this up for me?
3667 2018-08-23 17:17:39 There are thousands of cities around the world that all have the capability to compete in the IoT market, many with far lower labour costs and taxation. There is only one place that sits on the largest recoverable oil reserves in the world. Alberta. That is what makes us special.
3668 2018-08-23 17:17:37 I'm not even shocked anymore. Like the meat or dairy industry suing folks advising against too much of it. I stopped using canola oil to cook & use grapeseed, hazelnut and olive oils. Great flavours too. I use coconut milk to cook&love it. Never used coconut oil for cooking tho'.
3669 2018-08-23 17:17:33 Same.
3670 2018-08-23 17:17:33 I’ve had this hair my whole life and only this week figured out the key to second-day curls isn’t any of those curl refresher sprays. It’s more argan oil.

3678 2018-08-23 17:17:10 I find it very hard to believe that Canada, with abundant oil actually imports oil. The Energy East pipeline would make it possible to never import oil again.
3679 2018-08-23 17:17:08 Ketchup on fries is ONLY for after they're not piping hot anymore, and then it should be Spicy Ketchup from Whataburger. Hot fries just need the oil they fried in & salt.

Burger sauce is trash.

3688 2018-08-23 17:16:17 If you add the sesame oil at the very end, your rice will get very oily tasting.

I would add the sesame oil after you've heated the peanut oil and just before adding your rice to cook. That way the flavor profile is added and the oil is cooked away.
3689 2018-08-23 17:16:13 America has oil?

3698 2018-08-23 17:15:32 GST is not a bad thing, as usual we Indians find loop holes in every thing and misuse. We cant blame the govt for Rupee fall because its the cruse oil price is the major role in ruppe fall. Pm sow the seed, it take some time for us to get the fruits. We need to wait.

3707 2018-08-23 17:15:02 advocating for eating processed oil? yep, you need facts. also, look at her pic, she is definitely NOT fine health-wise.
3708 2018-08-23 17:15:01 God bless German engineering I guess, I have an 04 Passat pushing 100K and I made it from New Hampshire to Florida in one go with no issues. Burning through the oil like that is risky, but hey some cars can take it and some cant.

3712 2018-08-23 17:14:50 I understand the problem that would arise with ZPE. But what about the other technologies people have been killed for? Water powered cars wouldn't pose a threat. Only to the big oil companies. Tesla had an electric car 100 years ago.
3713 2018-08-23 17:14:49 Well, slather me in poison from head to toe, because coconut oil is my favorite way to go.

3716 2018-08-23 17:14:39 So it looks like the weekend will be filled with me trying to sell off the blazer ( transmission shot and,  even though the engine still runs,  there is oil in the radiator. Not good) and replacing a blown out radiator in my other vehicle .
3717 2018-08-23 17:14:37 Exactly said , this is bot only happening with oil or toothpaste , but also food products .

3728 2018-08-23 17:14:10 In this world, you must achieve to be noticed and mentioned... How many times did turkana trend before oil was discovered?

3735 2018-08-23 17:13:55 It doesn't work for my hair either. I've heard that the cropping up of these videos are from traditional oil companies who want you to continue to use canola and traditional oils. Weird.. So much conflicting info.

3766 2018-08-23 17:12:10 I agree the Arab Oil embargo destroyed the economy for a period of time, but the Nixon Impeachment and resignation left a cloud over the markets for years.  If the economy had of been booming like it is now Nixon probably would not have been forced to resign.
3767 2018-08-23 17:12:04 While it’s not something I’d ever eat, may and potatoes have a history. I prefer fresh cut fries, air fried, with a faint kiss of Diamond Crystal Salt. Period. Use the air fryer that doesn’t need ANY oil. Perfection.

3774 2018-08-23 17:11:55 But coconut oil is bad for you! Seriously though, my husband’s family came here decades ago and I could never imagine the heartache they went through crossing the border. All are citizens now, so this hits too close to home-kids in cages, not coconut oil.
3775 2018-08-23 17:11:52 Women get cars don’t check the tires, get the oil changed, get tuned ups... They just ignore every service and maintenance light while driving 
3776 2018-08-23 17:11:46 Waiting 2 hours for an oil change luckily they have discount HGTV to keep us all entertained.
3777 2018-08-23 17:11:38 Oil was big reason, also women joining workforce. PART rate for women 20+ went from 51.3% in Jan 1980 to 58.0% by end of 1980. Supply shift
ps yes similar to increasing in 1970s, but men PART fell in 70s and stayed flat in 1980s

3784 2018-08-23 17:10:49 Unfortunately, it’s not just the Publicans that want to drill for oil on both of our coasts. It was also part of Obama’s original energy plan. He did wise up. The plan was to drill right where the Chesapeake Bay enters the ocean.
3785 2018-08-23 17:10:42 I don’t disagree with your characterization.The risk to white farmers is under reported and real.

3799 2018-08-23 17:09:41 There’s a saying “the squeaky wheel gets the oil”

3843 2018-08-23 17:04:59 Sometimes over qualified people do over analysis and give weird statements forgetting about basics!! All South Indians are eating coconut oil everyday, do  they have short lives or they become  used to for poison?
3844 2018-08-23 17:04:46 Aren’t they two different oils? Canola oil is improvised version of the other one but still contains some toxic contents as far as I’ve read.
3845 2018-08-23 17:04:45 So we deliver 90%of UK oil. 25% of UK food and drink . 5.5 million out of what 60uk population and we have a 5th of the debt?  

Hmmm. Really?  I don't mean to sound unkind but torys are not renound for their charity 

If we cost uk a penny we would be jettisoned immediately
3846 2018-08-23 17:04:43 So many people use all these different face masks, brushes,washes, moisturizers, etc... All I use is African Black Soap, a dollar tree brush (works amazing) and either coconut oil or African Shea Butter  My face keeps a glow, is usually very clear and is never dry. LESS IS MORE
3847 2018-08-23 17:04:41 The news just said anything containing hemp oil is illegal in Alabama...alright y'all go raid ulta. Lotion and shampoo are illegal now. 
3848 2018-08-23 17:04:38 Russia will never attacked the west who will buy their oil and gas?
3849 2018-08-23 17:04:34 Coconut/mustard. Ricebran-when I need a neutral oil

3851 2018-08-23 17:04:15 How much oil does a wind turbine need? Please research. Thanks.
3852 2018-08-23 17:04:13 Americans don't want indians to be healthy otherwise who will buy their medicines etc . Coconut oil is Indian version of amruth.
3853 2018-08-23 17:04:08 Always weary of using new skin care products but i picked up a new oil cleanser and scrub and my skin is soooooooo glowy and moisturizerized !!
3854 2018-08-23 17:03:55 @BBCR1 news beat:

3856 2018-08-23 17:03:41 if you're going to talk about how we should avoid meat and palm oil and factory clothes pls walk the walk and suggest affordable/accessible alternatives
3857 2018-08-23 17:03:28 씨발 뭐야 저거
3858 2018-08-23 17:03:20 Actually that's incorrect Venezuela was in massive trouble prior to that under Chavez when oil was plentiful. It's due to their adherence to command economics a proven failure so get your facts right and stop blaming others for the inefficiency of a failed system.
3859 2018-08-23 17:03:05 Wait, I got it, let's sell the strategic oil reserve to my friends. I'll get a good price!
3860 2018-08-23 17:02:59 sana oil HAHA

3862 2018-08-23 17:02:58 Tea tree oil has been working wonders on my skin.
3863 2018-08-23 17:02:57 Ex pats fill posts that the local community cannot do. If I’m an immigrant then I should have some chance of citizenship, not even after 15years and not a chance. Tax paying should be applauded, unlike the oil people who get off shore status, we don’t.
3864 2018-08-23 17:02:56  I'm starting to like acrylic paint but my favorites are charcoal and oil pastels 
3865 2018-08-23 17:02:42 I was in the same boat once. I felt like all the fun had been taken out of my life. I found that I could tolerate olive oil. Beautiful olive oil and garlic and herbs can make anything divine. Just dump a lot of it on any veggie you can tolerate.
3866 2018-08-23 17:02:30 They sell cbd oil at that new shop on tower. Kinda pricey but it works great.
3867 2018-08-23 17:02:29 everyone loves talking shit about coconut oil but it’s never done me wrong so
3868 2018-08-23 17:02:27 Handshake was meant to create an enabling environment for difficult economic times and secret  Turkana oil deals. No one has Kenyans @Heart
3869 2018-08-23 17:02:26 "Florida Amendment 9, Ban Offshore Oil and Gas Drilling and Ban Vaping in Enclosed Indoor Workplaces Amendment" please tell me how these things go together?????
3870 2018-08-23 17:02:25 Mayonnaise is perfect for fries. But dipping fries in a chocolate malt is acceptable. And real fries are cooked in beef fat, not vegetable oil! Hot dogs require mustard and that neon green relish on steamed buns. Burgers need ketchup or bbq sauce and onions on grilled buns.
3871 2018-08-23 17:02:21 Dept of Trans estimates at an avg mileage of 25 mpg, a single #EV can displace about 468 gallons of gas per yr, or 25 Barrels of #oil
With our #EV I think I calculated we displace 32 barrels of oil!
3872 2018-08-23 17:02:11 But largest reserves of oil on the planet... it just doesn’t make sense , does it?
You’d have to try really really hard to fail the economy this badly..
3873 2018-08-23 17:02:07 Thinking of new menu items for Smash. How do we feel about truffle oil/butter?

3875 2018-08-23 17:01:57 Assholes olive oil is poisonous and should be banned in Asia
3876 2018-08-23 17:01:56 Since coconut oil has been outted as the new silent killer. I'm going back to using vinegar as lube.
3877 2018-08-23 17:01:46 Would you like a website for your business?, we work on oil field websites in this area, having a website for your business give credibility and it give your business an online presence, lmk if you’re interested  #Webdesign #webdevelopment

3879 2018-08-23 17:01:45 Yes Reliance Jamnagar unit which is world's biggest oil refinery buys crude oil from gulf countries ,refines it then sells back finished petroleum products to them. This because cost of refining oil at Jamnagar is much lower then refining it in gulf countries like UAE
3880 2018-08-23 17:01:40 Noted for future: if you’re doing a rocur and reaction is slow, apparently tweeting a photo of your breakfast which includes meat is a good way to get an immediate reaction telling you you’re contributing to climate change (as if palm oil consumers aren’t).

3885 2018-08-23 17:01:13 The soft nature of skin is why coconut oil wouldn’t be as good. It’s just an oil. Products made for people usually have a silicone base to help oil adhere to skin while a simple oil would be absorbed or rubbed off. Jojoba oil absorbs into skin & nails, it a good for bad nails.
3886 2018-08-23 17:01:11 sick of this.  Oil v. Canada.
3887 2018-08-23 17:01:11 Let the local leaders let their people & Turkana county benefit from the agreed share of explored oil before the national government ferries its share to Mombasa for marketing which is a source of revenue collection to national government.
3888 2018-08-23 17:01:00 President Donald Trump is blaming OPEC for rising oil prices, but analysts say his sanctions on Iran are largely fueling a rally in the crude market.
3889 2018-08-23 17:01:00 "Children are being separated from their parents at the border."

People: "Too bad. Shouldn't be crossing illegally."

"Coconut oil is actually not that great for you and it's packed with saturated fat."

People: "LISTEN, MOTHERFUCKER!!!"

3893 2018-08-23 17:00:46 wages and oil and less indexation
3894 2018-08-23 17:00:42 Oh Im in total agreement. I would just turn the water/gas/oil off until they started playing nice.
3895 2018-08-23 17:00:31 @SenTedCruz tweets about oil, money taken from education to buy guns in schools (which would make NRA happy) but ignores pressing issues of @realDonaldTrump being unindicted co-conspirator in federal crime and  Trump incriminating himself on tv Vote Cruz OUT

3899 2018-08-23 17:00:19 Yea,but I'm with bae n she's highly inflammable I no get strength to separate fight
3900 2018-08-23 17:00:17 Discrimination is not always bad, we discriminate against threats to our safety all the time, it's how we live, it's why we don't keep pouring oil on fires.
3901 2018-08-23 17:00:10 The entire concept of microaggressions is a microaggression to me.
3902 2018-08-23 17:00:06 We carry CBD and Hemp oil products from companies you can trust.
3903 2018-08-23 17:00:05 Look up how much oil is needed for wind turbines. (Hint: it’s a huge engine, it needs a LOT of oil.)
3904 2018-08-23 17:00:03 So we are exporting oil, yet we are paying high prices for our own gas!  Where is the #MAGA attitude for that Cruz?  I’m voting for #BetoforSenate!
3905 2018-08-23 16:59:58 Women get a car & don’t check the oil, tire pressure, coolant, no nothing. They just wake up & drive that mf .

3907 2018-08-23 16:59:43 We invaded all these oil rich middle eastern countries bc of human rights abuses/terrorism? 

You are either naive or stupid
3908 2018-08-23 16:59:42 Simply sister bse it’s f***g white supremacy daily mass media indoctrination & incubation: it’s mental political syndrome to monitor oil, $ & citizens
3909 2018-08-23 16:59:38 he might never used to massage his hair with pure coconut oil thats y he's got to say such rubbish..  domestic coconut oil never be "pure poison"
3910 2018-08-23 16:59:37 I like the Short covering in $BTE today, high volume. Those who don’t cover now, watch out if #oil goes higher!
3911 2018-08-23 16:59:36 I've never had a problem with coconut oil. Maybe she's just nuts?
3912 2018-08-23 16:59:35 Me- walks into tire discounters after working since 4:30am:

Asks if I can lay in my car while they change my oil
3913 2018-08-23 16:59:21 The charts look promising .  I musn't get too technical, what I know about charts is dangerous. You can't win if you're not in.  Good luck 
3914 2018-08-23 16:59:12 Course oil revenue doesn't come into these figures a mere 38 billion
3915 2018-08-23 16:58:57 How can anyone have poison and live for 100 years? my great grand father did. We always cook food in coconut oil at home.
3916 2018-08-23 16:58:35 Moringa Oil di nagd-dry. Sarap gamitin sa edging.
3917 2018-08-23 16:58:25 Lol I need an oil change ASAP. I don’t even wanna drive my car.
3918 2018-08-23 16:58:21 I am now 72.I used coconut oil from my childhood.Let them say how long one will live by taking poison.
3919 2018-08-23 16:58:18 The trick is to look for non-comedogenic oils, but even those can clog your pores if you use too much. I’m pretty positive olive and coconut oil are non. There’s a lot of good recipes on Pinterest, or if you want to buy something just check the labels.
3920 2018-08-23 16:58:07 If Venezuela had been capitalist but relied on oil for 95% of its income what would the outcome have been when the oil price fell?
3921 2018-08-23 16:57:59 I have a good man because when I was going fast on the highway my babe yelled go black diamond & told me this weekend he was going to get my oil changed for me

3925 2018-08-23 16:57:35 Scottish Govt. provides spending figures, UK govt guestimates income minus Rig to ship oil and most Scottish exports (including dog food) going through rUK ports.
3926 2018-08-23 16:57:35 #coconutoil So whose eating coconut oil? I thought it was only good for skin and hair.
3927 2018-08-23 16:57:33 SA should be sanctioned. We have oil. They export nothing else.
3928 2018-08-23 16:57:24 Giants PR: "The Dodgers lost and everyone knows they're winning the division so we didn't lose any ground. " Except Arizona is 4.5 up on LA and no one can put out that Oil Field fire that is the Dodgers bullpen.
3929 2018-08-23 16:57:08 I just use coconut oil as a body moisturizer bc lotion is too tedious 
3930 2018-08-23 16:57:05 This professor must be bribed by some multinational edible oil company.

3933 2018-08-23 16:56:46 lol the colonizers are now saying coconut oil is “poison” but meanwhile are newly fascinated by turmeric... ok both ingredients heavily used in Indian food and lifestyle for centuries, didn’t you catch on when yall do what you do best? Colonize?

3937 2018-08-23 16:56:15 Viva bobiwine.There is no oil Uganda that's why western countries have kept mum
3938 2018-08-23 16:56:15 FGOクソすぎやんけ
3939 2018-08-23 16:56:00 There are many dealers in Oil sector, that underpay their employees at the petrol pumps to counter that government made it mandatory for every dealer to pay his/her labour’s minimum wages directly into the bank account. All credit goes to @narendramodi @dpradhanbjp.
3940 2018-08-23 16:55:54 Going long conventional oil tech might be a way...
3941 2018-08-23 16:55:52 It wil be shared among the tribe.
3942 2018-08-23 16:55:41 - 100 grams grinded coffee

It’s super simple: just mix the powders together, than add the coconut oil. Put it in a jar, and use it twice a week for more results!

3949 2018-08-23 16:55:17 Well coconut oil is only bad for you if your allergic to it! And I don’t use it because of my husband’s aunt is allergic to it and I don’t want to accidentally kill her.
3950 2018-08-23 16:55:07 I prefer just buying the joints at the local dispensaries and smoking it. I think the oil thing is a bit of a sham. Have seen many people try it for seizures and ADD with no success.

3961 2018-08-23 16:54:26 I can smell the bean oil!

3966 2018-08-23 16:54:02 Olive isn’t good for Indian cooking so I use Canola oil
3967 2018-08-23 16:53:58 i thought it was sipping or stepping.... i need to find the little lyric book that comes with LM ugh
3968 2018-08-23 16:53:53 Perfect!! I've got the straight oil and a vape. Plus there's a smoke shop like five mins from the venue I can take ya to that has it all! They've got the oil, gummies, and daily doses
3969 2018-08-23 16:53:48 Despite the failed coup Venezuela ‘s turnover with oil sales alone was in the period 1999-2017 >$1,500,000,000 and with a very large gross profit in the period until 2013. They destroyed their own country and all it was before, themselves before any sanctions in 2017. Thugs!
3970 2018-08-23 16:53:45 So now coconut oil is bad for u wtf
3971 2018-08-23 16:53:45 stop using coconut oil on your skin

start using witch hazel as a cleanser or toner 

#makeupfacts
3972 2018-08-23 16:53:41 Indy has been mentioned by execs I spoke to, also. Only reason I didn't list it was the unsettled stadium situation. Lucas Oil won't work, AFAIK.
3973 2018-08-23 16:53:38 Surely they would just let us go in order to correct their own failing economy? Save themselves billions a year? It’s almost like all of that is an absolute lie isn’t it? Scotland: the only country in the world to discover oil and get poorer. Lot of rubbish.

3981 2018-08-23 16:52:58 I guess Coconut Oil can be poison.

If you eat the entire god damn jar.
3982 2018-08-23 16:52:58 @SchwartzHealth site is still down. Can’t get my free bottle of fish oil. How long will this continue ?
3983 2018-08-23 16:52:54 My broker rang me today and said they would buy my shares for £3 each. The shakers were full of oil. But I’ve decided i will wait for a few weeks and sell for 17p
3984 2018-08-23 16:52:51 The Coast Guard is searching for a missing spear fisherman 75 miles south of Sabine Pass, TX.  An emergency radio beacon signal was received Wednesday evening from a 22-foot pleasure craft tied to an oil rig.   Missing is 65 year-old Alfred Charles Lensing. #khou #HTownRush
3985 2018-08-23 16:52:29 So what do you wanna use olive oil for?

3989 2018-08-23 16:51:53 悪い所とか嫌な所だけに目を向けるだけに飽き足らず、安易な類型化で、その不快の発生源を不当に広げてるような意見は、問題提起としても幼稚すぎんか？ 苟も問題提起のつもりなら、地域や性別のみならず、世代や環境、実際のデータなんかも考慮に入れるべきじゃろ
3990 2018-08-23 16:51:51 The Zorilla or Skunk, is common. It ejects a fetid oil. Clothes once touched are forever useless. Every other animal makes room for it.
3991 2018-08-23 16:51:46 Ask him to go to hell & stop calling this idiot, a professor. For generations Kerala has been using coconut oil as their primary oil for all food items. There has been no issues. This creep has probably got some huge money from 1of the oil companies for doing this verbal diarrhea
3992 2018-08-23 16:51:44 That's right! Coconut's wonderful. As far as the fat is concerned, obviously all kinds of fats are bad for health. And one has to watch what one eats. But to say that Coconut oil is poison, lol! That's an over-reaction and silly.
3993 2018-08-23 16:51:40 At least you vote in your own interest. Oil&Gas benefits most from Ted and Oil&Gas is his biggest contributor block.
You'll benefit. The remaining Ted supporters are voting to take away their own SS, Medicare, clean air&water.
But they'll get "to own a lib".
3994 2018-08-23 16:51:34 you’ve really got out love making sessions planned out to the second huh? :3c *comes back, holding a bottle of body oil low on his hIP O H*
3995 2018-08-23 16:51:32 I knew I had finally started loving myself when I was eager to wake up just to bathe & lather myself in coconut oil staring @ myself in the mirror, while ignoring & not looking for calls/texts hitting my phone. It was pure bliss my favorite moment of the day everyday
3996 2018-08-23 16:51:29 And mums the word on the American white dude screwing his coworker who murdered his pregnant wife , 2 beautiful daughter and put them in oil barrels... I’m not surprised at all
3997 2018-08-23 16:51:29 For desi food-Mustard oil. 
Otherwise olive oil.
3998 2018-08-23 16:51:26 I don’t see Tottenham or Everton playing in European finals though pal. In fact, I don’t even see City and that’s with all the oil money.

4002 2018-08-23 16:51:11 It doesn’t make sense to refine it because no country will buy refined oil and at the same time, the country has debts to pay back, if successful, this is one of the main methods of clearing that debt
4003 2018-08-23 16:51:06 Ayy where is groundnut oil?
4004 2018-08-23 16:51:00 So Corey is taking my car to get a oil change Saturday. I wonder if will clean the entire thing for me inside & out  it’s gross  I should be ashamed of letting my car get like this....

4006 2018-08-23 16:50:44 Interesting, thanks. Good to see reference to recent @CarbonBubble report and possible implications of high price. 
CO2 price hit €20 today for the first time in a decade, and is estimated to hit €25 by year end. 
This will oil the political economy machinery nicely.
4007 2018-08-23 16:50:42 I've not disgraced myself in 30 years, apart from the odd occasion ;-)

Really fancy bread and oil now...
4008 2018-08-23 16:50:41 Hahahaha!  Yeah I was taught we would run of oil by 2000 as a child too..
4009 2018-08-23 16:50:36 Bulshit..she must be representing the soya oil lobby which is now shaken by the popularity of coconut oil. That oil is not poison but such people are..

4023 2018-08-23 16:49:39 Very simple Sri. Americans hate what they don’t have. Have read enough in this subject and benefits of coconut oil/water are better than any other.
4024 2018-08-23 16:49:35 You didn’t ask for the unsolicited advice, but if you’re drinking that much coffee you may want to consider alkalizing as much as you can in other ways. And maybe add a little bit of healthy fat to your coffee, like a tsp of coconut oil, to help protect your organs?

4029 2018-08-23 16:49:19 I need to get my oil changed.
4030 2018-08-23 16:49:16 I get that folks were tired of 'Establishment' Republicans talking the talk during election time then forgetting about them after the election was over. Where I part ways with Trump followers is I think he's a snake oil salesman, a con man (see Trump 'U'), a Lonesome Rhodes.
4031 2018-08-23 16:49:15 Instead of pushing Harvard professor’s propaganda We did factual analysis of coconut oil and clearly stated the benefits and limitations of coconut oil.

It's back now, but has been over an hour which is pretty impressive.  
The relief was also quite instant. 
It was £70 for the oil tho

4086 2018-08-23 16:44:38 こういうツーリングやってみてわかったんですけど、単純に車重があるし、バイク自体も速くないので走ること自体がめちゃめちゃ辛かったです、バイクパッキングのルートの描き方とか走り方みたいなのもトピックとしてあっても良いのかなと思いました。
4087 2018-08-23 16:44:38 “Poison”?  Coconut oil was reported to be “bad” for our hearts twenty years ago.  Some certainly won’t hurt most people.  But the current belief that we must use it on everything is probably not the best one...
4088 2018-08-23 16:44:35 Fuck Saudi Arabia you oil obsessed buffoons!!
4089 2018-08-23 16:44:33 I assumed Buildings referred to burning natural gas or heating oil for heating. Assessing electricity to power generation and buildings would double count it, no?
4090 2018-08-23 16:44:21 Side note: There is a difference between oil countries and countries with people who actually work and add real value to the market.
4091 2018-08-23 16:44:20 Coconut oil has been a much used by-product in the islands (Philippines) for a long time! Coconut is “sacred” in the islands - we use each and every part of it. We even call it the tree of life. Wtf r yall talking abt
4092 2018-08-23 16:44:18 I love the oil rigs. They mean independents from foreign oil
4093 2018-08-23 16:44:17 Tune up. I'm having them do the oil change while it's in, and the smog check.
4094 2018-08-23 16:44:12 What about the kids killed by the American military for the sake of oil ? Oh yeah.. they're not American kids. So it's easier not to give a fuck about them.
4095 2018-08-23 16:44:04 So very sorryMy daughter suffers from this. We’re trying hemp-derived CBD oil right now. Please please please share the things that help you in your journey

4102 2018-08-23 16:43:27 Coconut oil is pure poison??? So then I think that if that's true, then 90% of the population of earth should have gone extinct by now. Coconut oil that's said to have many good vitamins and other sources in it is used for many things. Hair, food, body lotion, etc. So now what??
4103 2018-08-23 16:43:06 Trying to head to school and my dad is changing my oil, I realllllllly appreciate it but why now ):
4104 2018-08-23 16:43:02 I need some human oil
4105 2018-08-23 16:43:02 US State Department says the US is committed to close partnership with the country that has committed some of the worst terrorist attacks on its oil, and Canada should follow them like a pet in also being committed to a close partnership with said country that commits attacks.
4106 2018-08-23 16:43:00 Actually CBD oil from hemp has about 0.3% or under THC. The only 0% THC products are CBD isolate.
4107 2018-08-23 16:42:59 My dad got me new tires and an oil change today and I’m so excited 
4108 2018-08-23 16:42:48 Can we build a wall around our own citizens who murder their pregnant wife and two daughters, and throw them in oil barrels?
4109 2018-08-23 16:42:44 This and the Saudis bombing a school bus should be more than enough to impose trade sanctions on them. Starting with oil.
4110 2018-08-23 16:42:33 It's about saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Clickbait news to get more visitors. Most animal fats saturated, but plant and fish fats are unsaturated. Articles claim coconut oil is made mostly of saturated fats, then how it's liquid in room temperature?
4111 2018-08-23 16:42:33 Coconut oil and booze, man.  Poison except in moderation.  (Then less poison.)
4112 2018-08-23 16:42:29 I started some new CBD oil and this stuff is nasty! Hopefully it helps though.
4113 2018-08-23 16:42:24 Ya reason to promote their own oil products like they did with Ghee in past. Vested interest try and understand friends. Generations of Kerala have lived on coconut oil
4114 2018-08-23 16:42:17 Jamaican Castor Oil makes my scalp itch even more 
4115 2018-08-23 16:42:14 It's time for @KagutaMuseveni to roll a few heads in his gov't and around him. I've followed the recent events especially the new taxes on social media,fuel,cooking oil,etc.  These have increased tension in the country as everyone is affected.
4116 2018-08-23 16:42:14 Humans have used guns for hundreds of years

Doesn't make them good

When facts show that overconsumption of coconut oil is bad for you, it's bad for you regardless of how long it's been used
4117 2018-08-23 16:42:07 I was referring to the West Coast oil rubbish

4120 2018-08-23 16:41:59 Like white people and coconut oil.
4121 2018-08-23 16:41:59 uae money goes to #cmdrf . It will be used for relief operations. and it is audited. Otherwise gulf money has been coming to kerala since oil boom in 70s. #keralafloods
4122 2018-08-23 16:41:56 housing, oil prices and interest rates are the three to watch
4123 2018-08-23 16:41:51 I was merely trying to raise recognition for the lube and oil faction.  But perhaps @poponjer would consider this part of the oil change segment for the e brake this week.

4144 2018-08-23 16:39:41 The Harvard professor should have studied the coconut oil that is Organic with no GMO and is gluten free. That ones not poisonous at all. Pretty sure it’s FDA approved. #coconutoil #poisonouscoconutoil #Harvard
4145 2018-08-23 16:39:37 Their diet is vastly different from Western ones. Coconut oil used in Western diets is extremely harmful. That's the difference. We eat crap, plai & simple, in the US. Especially with healthy food costing a lot more than the refined premade junk.

4151 2018-08-23 16:39:08 "disincentive to conservation" is just the flip side of "price elasticity". We don't want to over-incentivize electricity conservation is it means substituting wood/oil heat or slowing conversion to electric vehicles.

Your guff on oil & gas and food and drink exports is nothing to do with GERS you fool.
4166 2018-08-23 16:38:06 I stated that property theft through eminent domain occurs in the US. To clarify, it happens in some states & is systemic in some states (such as Louisiana using eminent domain to give oil pipelines to private businesses). Occurrences of property theft happens in the US. Clear?

4213 2018-08-23 16:34:23 @AnnChildersMD I think you should require more study on coconut oil to various countries then say.
4214 2018-08-23 16:34:15 Coconut oil is good on keto diet....  but sataurated fat is bad if we consume too much sugar or too many carbs... Choose your fuel and stick to it... I stuck to Keto.. I lost 30 pounds and my resting heart rate is at 58-60 at the moment.
4215 2018-08-23 16:34:15 @MGNTheTwin We shifted to Pure Poison, Ghee & Olive oil exclusively and has seen significant improvements in health on the contrary!
4216 2018-08-23 16:34:10 Dawn, hydrogen peroxide, and baking soda bath gets rid of the oil and smell.
4217 2018-08-23 16:33:46 Your explanation was great! While I do think the decreased fluidity of saturated fats have some negative effects on the body, I don’t think they’re the final mediator on the formation of LDL-B. However, if you’re trying to manage your weight, I’d stay far away from coconut oil
4218 2018-08-23 16:33:43 All South Indians use coconut oil for all purposes
4219 2018-08-23 16:33:40 Lo mismo que hace el Gobierno con el impuesto injustificado al diésel, lo hará en un tiempo con la gasolina.
Sin embargo muchos híbridos, los EV, PHEV etc siguen siendo caros.
Los precios del gas - oil y de la gasolina, aumentarán de forma inasumible por el usuario.
4220 2018-08-23 16:33:39 It check like oil rice dem add colour 
4221 2018-08-23 16:33:34 We'll see! I take things level to level, as you know things are rarely simple with oil. Right now I'm looking for a bounce. On my continuous contract chart there's a channel of lower highs in purple that we havn't broken yet, if we can hold above its a good sign for higher prices
4222 2018-08-23 16:33:28 Because we are looking at other countries who actually want to do fair trade. Our government bought the pipeline so we don’t have to do as much oil business with America which means more money in our pocket. Less sending through America and getting charged, it goes through Canada
4223 2018-08-23 16:33:27 えっ来てくださいよ〜〜
4224 2018-08-23 16:33:22 Exactly my thinking-all those years then subject to the worst of humanity and palm oil greed..
4225 2018-08-23 16:33:19 It is also not clear how & y UAE shd be so liberal when they themselves r fighting hard to save a falling economy mainly due to falling oil prices & d cascading effect on jobs & income. If I remember correctly initial offer was 5 crores. Is it some middlemen playing poltcs??
4226 2018-08-23 16:33:18 Er, not really. Pipes and tanks for storing oil aren't built to deal with the fact that liquid hydrogen is highly volatile and explosive, so most oil rigs would need a majority of their production equipment totally replaced.
4227 2018-08-23 16:33:16 Not sure but it is higher oil content than Canola.
4228 2018-08-23 16:33:10 No, the origin of Barnett was Scotland's oil. It was put in place to marginally increase Scottish spending whilst massively increasing English spending. Why do you think that's good?

4231 2018-08-23 16:32:38 Grapeseed oil always been my go-to, especially for the big booty bitches. I’ll give the ole coconut oil a try though.

4309 2018-08-23 16:27:59 I don’t understand how this news surprises anyone. Coconut oil is a solid. It’s about as healthy as the other solid cooking “oil” Think Crisco. Once Coconut oil cools in you, you’re going to have a fatty solid in your veins. It’s really not that complicated

4337 2018-08-23 16:26:04 The halving of the oil price has hurt all of the US oil majors and made many of the horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking fields in the US uneconomical.  However it hasn’t caused economic collapse in the US, unlike Venezuela.
4338 2018-08-23 16:26:04 Another propaganda to demean Indian way of living! Shame on such research! Requesting Indians not to further fall prey to such nonsense! One can see Olive oil being sold in malls across at 6-7 times cost of coconut oil! India:Wake up!

4348 2018-08-23 16:25:14 My grandparents lived for 90+ yrs without any known disease..they had coconut base curry, chutney for breakfast, lunch, dinner & coconut oil for cooking, frying fish. My father lived upto 75 yrs, mother now is 80+ with similar diet. We, South Indians can't be w/o coconut.
4349 2018-08-23 16:25:12 The huge problem with e-oils is that the system encourages one not to get 1 oil, but to get the next, then clean your body, then your house, then join the community, then this and then that.. where do you stop? Can you even see the danger? The stoppers? (Cont)
4350 2018-08-23 16:24:42 @sudhirchaudhary By the way, South Indian used coconut oil as major edible oil. But, the prevalence rate of cancer in South India is far lower than world average. It is a bogus claim. Unrefined coconut oil free of any carcinogenic effect.

4386 2018-08-23 16:21:31 Because as a society we've allowed morons to not believe in science. And with that comes "wives tales" of cure alls and snake oil sales men pushing their products.

4445 2018-08-23 16:17:46 @sudhirchaudhary ji Ur DNA reg coconut oil gained a lot of free media attention. It is a propaganda to stop coconut oil market fm edible oil list. By smple logic of science, it is not refined n hence not dehydrogenated. All refined oils r dehydrogenated n hence thy r carcinogenic

4462 2018-08-23 16:15:53 Being something of an "amateur" foodie (read "I like food"), lemme weigh in on coconut oil.

No, coconuts and coconut oils are not "pure poison"; however, in terms of amounts eaten, if you eat coconut oil every day in every meal, you will see the negative effects.
4463 2018-08-23 16:15:52 we can’t even agree about coconut oil?
4464 2018-08-23 16:15:49 Here are a few examples for you to better understand what EU stands for. Business with #Iran translates into hundreds of millions of euro for Irish companies, trade between Iran and the Czech Republic is about €70.77 million, and Iran is the 5th market for oil sales to Spain.
4465 2018-08-23 16:15:47 Baghdadi was a cleric.

4476 2018-08-23 16:14:55 Coconut Oil Update:

4478 2018-08-23 16:14:44 Organic coconut oil is selling at 3times price of olive oil, as superfood abroad . They have to do something.  Us naturopathic doctors say CANOLA is the worst as that is refined rapeseed oil. But that is marketed as healthy oil.

4481 2018-08-23 16:14:32 Really??  Am not sure about that...  The one am using is made of bergamot, olive oil and castor oil.  If there is coconut oil then that should be a plus
4482 2018-08-23 16:14:31 Ever since watching you play for the Oil Kings I wanted you to be an Oiler. They need your lightheartedness. And your ability. You made McDavid lighten up during the World Juniors.
4483 2018-08-23 16:14:29 WTI Crude oil spec positions are north of 600 mill barrels. By comparison last peak in 2014 positions were half that. Oil inventories in Cushing OK are only 30 mill barrels. It just shows how tail is now wagging the dog. Financialization of all markets has created enormous risks

4489 2018-08-23 16:14:05 Yes you have to make sure that is 100% RAW Coconut  Oil. What are they using to make it an oil base. Make sure it’s authentic & organic, As this same finding was said about olive oil,then later finding out that they were using harmful products to make it diluted to sell more.
4490 2018-08-23 16:13:53 That’s funny cause These Niggas at work were arguing this am and one says “suck my dick” and the other replies “Suck yo dick? BOY ILL SHOVE COCONUT OIL UP YO ASS AND EAT YOU LIKE AN ALMOND JOY”

4501 2018-08-23 16:13:05 As a cancer survivor and health freak I’ve been following. I’m inclined to believe what the last doc says. If you are eating tons of meat and cheese, coconut oil is not great. If it’s your primary source of saturated fat it’s prob ok.

4505 2018-08-23 16:12:46 Ore are you discussing Venezuela's oil industry?  Because that's not working out for them either.
4506 2018-08-23 16:12:44 Easy: Lower energy costs because of falling price of oil.
Also, once the S&L bubble burst, there was much lower demand.

4523 2018-08-23 16:10:55 When someone sent me this same eid message at 4pm left me wondering did this person even read the message she forwarded to me

4525 2018-08-23 16:10:41 A Nigeria without a genuine attempt to restructure will go nowhere. In a good year the nation earns $20b from crude oil; but Apple is worth $1 trillion. As the strategy tink tank of the PDP and in the interest of a glorious Nigeria please make this  your 2019 theme. God speed!

4528 2018-08-23 16:10:25 Even Mangaloreans cook with coconut oil on daily basis!
4529 2018-08-23 16:10:23 Hey @Golden_Lovie have gotten the Dax, another separate container having the coconut oil came with it 
Am I to mix it when I wanna use it?
4530 2018-08-23 16:10:22 @Gidi_Traffic Four persons were on Thursday in the early hours feared killed in  Umusadege Ogbe/Utagba Ogbe communities, Ndokwa West local Government  Area of Delta State following a clash with respect to the discovery of  oil in the area 10 years ago.
4531 2018-08-23 16:10:07 Ya think Trump’s doing Putin’s bidding by increasing Military spending by $750B, expanding US oil exploration to complete with Russia, getting NATO to contribute more $, chastising Merkel for building a pipeline for Russian gas, bringing more firms into US?
4532 2018-08-23 16:10:05 知ってる？スーパーってタダで牛脂くれるんだよ。
4533 2018-08-23 16:09:44 The term “holistic” is such weird BS. Like, hey, I’m a holistic auto mechanic, which means I understand that a car is a complex system with many different components dating back generations, and that’s why I don’t use motor oil
4534 2018-08-23 16:09:42 I made an appointment to get my oil changed in my car and I fucking missed it I made it for 10:30 but my bitchass was turning up in the living room watching the vmas
4535 2018-08-23 16:09:40 Thanks dude! It took 5 weeks for the ink to dry lmao it was oil based and not screen printed
4536 2018-08-23 16:09:23 Checked my own OIL IN MY CAR TODAY and learned via a manual how to open my car hood I’m basically a handyman now. DM me for any inquiries
4537 2018-08-23 16:09:19 I tried it at home. It doesn’t really taste the same when you use canola oil
4538 2018-08-23 16:09:07 I don't know what kind of research he did ....v r using from generations for massage  and cooking too....all are healthy ....mostly he did research with expiry dated coconut oil it seems

4543 2018-08-23 16:08:37 Yes and no...wherever coconut oil is in use fr consumption thr is high incidence of cardiovascular problems...much of the use is as hair oil...with Kerala topping in cooking as well...
4544 2018-08-23 16:08:31 What I'm saying if cb4211 is safe and shows some sort of efficacy, guarantee you $cwbr stock price will not be at these levels. So if it's same moa as olive oil and this shows any efficacy signals, we are off to the races
4545 2018-08-23 16:08:20 Nice! Good point. Just sitting in all that good luck

4548 2018-08-23 16:07:54 I'm with you Mike. HOWEVER... He DID just tweet what he screen shotted less than a week ago and all hell has broken loose. On top of that, Jon *actually* has official connections unlike most of the other snake oil salesman on twitter frequently dropping these types of tweets
4549 2018-08-23 16:07:54 He is trying to duplicate some of those things here in Canada! Why has he not developed our natural resources(oil) ? He cares more about the environment and carbon taxes and gender equality. That is no going to makes as any wealthier.

4551 2018-08-23 16:07:46 @foundmyfitness thoughts on the Harvard Prof who said coconut oil is “poison”
4552 2018-08-23 16:07:45 Thanks, was trying to think of a description for the ugly git! None like him are oil paintings!
4553 2018-08-23 16:07:45 Indias.using coconut oil for.1000s.of.years and they lived up to.90 yrs and above. Don't crack such funny jokes and be sensitive in ur research
4554 2018-08-23 16:07:45 Avocado oil and olive are good! However, canola oil causes liver damage. Canola isn’t natural.
4555 2018-08-23 16:07:44 ドウェイン・ジョンソンも多そうな気がします。「頑張ってるな、ロック」とか言い出す。敢えて「様」を付けない事で何らかの繋がりを周囲にそれとなくアピール。
4556 2018-08-23 16:07:36 Wrong Jimmy, Harvard overall gets corrupt money from Canola/Seed Oil corporations.

Coconut Oil and Butter are both natural and high in saturated fats. Both are completely healthy as long as processed and high carbs are omitted from the diet.
4557 2018-08-23 16:07:34 I'm always skeptical when something is called a super food. Coconut oil is fine for a lot of things but like any other food, it's not a magic cure all. Now black tar heroine, that's magic. 
4558 2018-08-23 16:07:33 On Australia specifically: I love my Aboriginal people, I do but if we chucked out the whites my money's on opportunistic snake oil salesmen backed by tribalistic thugs hording whatever's left and fuck everybody else within a week.
4559 2018-08-23 16:07:28 Well then I guess I should stop cooking with it, making my toothpaste soap and deodorant with it, oil pulling and using it on my skin, putting it in my coffee, using it to whiten clothing and remove stains... and on and on.
4560 2018-08-23 16:07:24 I remember I used to use coconut oil as a makeup remover because #TwitterToldMeTo and this was at a time when I wasn’t doing the proper research regarding skin care. I got the worst skin ever.
4561 2018-08-23 16:07:19 I'm proud yet very stressed, scared. The templars, history of Christianity fascinates me. @TheScottishRite @CIA the lady Julie @SaveMart  reminded me a bit of Mrs. Haspel and she knew this and purposely got oil all over my noodle cup and got oil on furniture and on my pants shirt
4562 2018-08-23 16:07:08 The timber industry is not the answer to a rapidly warming and drying climate which is stressing even mature native species across the continent but thanks anyways for proffering ur snake oil.  We need to address climate change and create a Marshall plan scale to this problem.
4563 2018-08-23 16:07:07 when you go for JUST an oil change and they tell you to throw the whole car away HAHA thank u
4564 2018-08-23 16:07:06 Poor Hellen Fox Noise has to use "special" oil funded chodes because real scientist make Fox look bad! But Fox and Trump hate truth so why should they like Sci? Its based on truth
4565 2018-08-23 16:06:45 the bitch who said coconut oil is terrible probably drinks coffee
4566 2018-08-23 16:06:43 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines
4567 2018-08-23 16:06:42 All MNC injecting deadliest diseases by selling poisoning edible oils to us-All edibles oil on display are fetal.

I have challenged this nefarious person to face me on TV to talk truth about Raw Virgin Coconut Oil

There isn't match to it on planet except Fats in Mothers Milk.
4568 2018-08-23 16:06:40 This is based on the projected midterm turnout, correct. Not the overall electorate?

4570 2018-08-23 16:06:28 You’re on the wrong side of history @seanhannity. Coal & oil must be replaced by solar and wind. Even you climate change deniers have to see what’s happening. And, unfortunately, some jobs have to go. Talk to the telephone operators—oh wait, you can’t, there aren’t any anymore.
4571 2018-08-23 16:06:21 ECONOMIC INDICATORS: 23 August @ 18:00

4573 2018-08-23 16:05:59 Not only " konkani speaking brahmins" madam...we entire coastal Karnataka and Kerala people use coconut oil n coconut based curry on daily basis.
4574 2018-08-23 16:05:59 Hope you’re feeling better bud. All I can say is it must be horrendous. Cannabis oil can help
4575 2018-08-23 16:05:55 @Harvard it's a shame that even your professors are being bought by the food corps to come out with a horse shite announcement that coconut oil is 'pure poison'. Remember when your institution was credible 
4576 2018-08-23 16:05:40 I still call every type of cooking oil groundnut oil  #homecoming

4583 2018-08-23 16:05:13 @MaximeBernier we need pipe lines to get our crude to refineries and market. We need 2 invest in solar, wind, and nuclear energy sources. We cannot rely on Saudi blood oil or other resources from various hostial nations. Our goal should be 100% energy independence
4584 2018-08-23 16:05:08 I don’t disagree. But I just can’t look past some of this shit just because oil and gas is doing well.
4585 2018-08-23 16:05:07 Come on eddie.. let’s have an update with some balls behind it.. we want to see figures and stats.. we want to see oil out the ground and money in the bank??
4586 2018-08-23 16:04:54 Kerja saya memang belajar dan menganalisa dari masa ke semasa. Dari satu industri ke industri yg lain. Berbincang dgn pakar dalam pelbagai bidang. Firma kecil saya tak labur dalam bidang yg kami tak arif dan tiada maklumat mendalam. Kepakaran saya pasaran oil&gas serta ekonomi.
4587 2018-08-23 16:04:52 Not only konkani speaking brahmins. All brahmins from coastal and most of the people from coastal area use coconut oil. We are very much fit.
4588 2018-08-23 16:04:42 no don’t wash the qeema and don’t oil it just brush it with bbq sauce and oil the grill so it does not stick and try using meat with as less fat as possible
4589 2018-08-23 16:04:35 Its unbelievabile .. but fact they make a lot of money and they want the controll of the port and the oil. 
4590 2018-08-23 16:04:29 Congrats to our winner @TomcatNASCAR!

He knows changing out fluids regularly is vital. So is properly disposing them.

We partner with 20,000+ dealerships for used oil and oil filter collection. Antifreeze and windshield washer fluids are offered through @PerformancePOil
4591 2018-08-23 16:04:25 HEHE.. So funny.. 
One fact for you.
In India 1 out of 4 person uses this coconut oil and using it from centuries and still all are alive..
4592 2018-08-23 16:04:22 Just heard an adult woman ask her friends “what’s fish oil for?”
Idk Jennifer - fishes? Maybe?
4593 2018-08-23 16:04:19 What the Greenspan Fed didn’t do. 5-1 ARMS made the transmission mechanism very very slow and all the loans issued in 2003 got face stomped in 2008 (at the same time oil was $150bbl) . Most overlooked contributor  to GFC.
4594 2018-08-23 16:04:17 Excellent thread, great book recommendation, and yet another true character about whom to learn. Thanks. May you always have free plane liquor.
4595 2018-08-23 16:04:14 Earlier today, @Holden114 correctly referred to this as "The Jen Rubinization of Tom Nichols"
4596 2018-08-23 16:03:55 A lot of nations in the world have multigenerational use of coconut oil
4597 2018-08-23 16:03:48 She is a technically challenged; coal is cleaner than oil overall. But them I am a chemical engineer and she is a total fool. We are led by idiots!
4598 2018-08-23 16:03:46 Stop importing oil from them. We are all extremely concerned, but only the government has the power to do something. Lots of talking and waving of arms. What is actually being done ?
4599 2018-08-23 16:03:43 True in a few cases, but overstated. Big Oil under Rockefeller, IBM, ATT, GM, MSFT, Google (mainly EU), who 1) misused market dominance or 2) Regs misunderstood the business as with IBM, which was going away anyway. But Facebook is defining its own 'state' and that's scary.
4600 2018-08-23 16:03:40 We know coconut oil is 80% saturated fat and coconut meat is 30% so it’s certain not good , however it’s not poison    Then all sugar is poison   Most things  in moderation.
4601 2018-08-23 16:03:39 The whole site went through a massive cleaning in the last month.  Sure needed it as it is running like a well oil machine now.  All Courses and lessons updated to new software as well as a new CDN for some of the most popular courses.
4602 2018-08-23 16:03:37 it's because you had mantle & anointing oil you can walk now, if not
4603 2018-08-23 16:03:32 First off- baking soda. It's your best friend. For grease, for odor, for everything. It's like coconut oil. Go getcha self some.
4604 2018-08-23 16:03:31 We serve to protect the free exchange of ideas, defend #NetNeutrality, and to invade countries for their oil, and kill innocent people across the globe. Good going, Raymond! #VetsForTheNet
4605 2018-08-23 16:03:30 Nevermind that 60% in Norway is largely seeded by oil revenue and debt. Norway is on borrowed time.
4606 2018-08-23 16:03:20 Well my grandad Eadie taught us coconut water is great! So il stick with the coconut oil too!  #PurePoison
4607 2018-08-23 16:03:13 I will grow one!

4610 2018-08-23 16:03:07 With @JustinTrudeau spending at billions on what was a knee jerk reaction That was not well thought out  It puts it as the biggest investment @Canada has spent on the West Coast 
That with the pro oil #DFO minister @JonathanWNV
Oil shipments will over ride all other concerns
4611 2018-08-23 16:02:57 It’s nonsensical to be a person that votes SNP because ‘UM SCOATISH’ ‘WEER A COUNTRY’ ‘ITS OOR OIL’ etc etc
4612 2018-08-23 16:02:37 Don't believe everything you read on the internet. Coconut oil and almond oil are the healthiest oils out there. #FuckHarvard

4616 2018-08-23 16:02:07 To push their edible oil   later them to push their evil pharma industry
4617 2018-08-23 16:02:05 i wanna save the rainforests but im poor and my parents keep buying products made with palm oil
4618 2018-08-23 16:02:00 middle chain triglyceride (coconut oil) is fast absorbable by the body and butter is slow metabolized both delicious tho
4619 2018-08-23 16:01:41 You should also try a mouthwash that has coconut oil in it! I used it for two months and loved it and just ran out, so I’m getting some more! Coconut oil is supposed to be good for teeth/whitening!
4620 2018-08-23 16:01:35 This is probably just big pharma trying to keep people sick so their profit stays sky high.

I have seen first hand how cannabis and coconut oil cure people of cancer and parkinson's disease. 

If you want to stay sick stay hooked on big pharma.

4624 2018-08-23 16:01:24 Kerala people eat so much junk food. They also eat refined coconut oil mostly. That is a sample that proves junk food is bad
4625 2018-08-23 16:01:24 Didn’t really consume coconut oil. So I think I’m good..
4626 2018-08-23 16:01:18 The coastal zone of Nigeria has in recent years been subjected to increasing economic activities, primarily driven by seaport activities and oil eploration and exploitation #CoastalHistory
4627 2018-08-23 16:01:15 And to invest and build on renewables to replace the oil as and when it runs out.
4628 2018-08-23 16:01:10 Best to wait till after Scottish independence when suddenly oil becomes worthless and a burden according to unionists so they'll pick it up for nothing

4633 2018-08-23 16:00:43 Battery only has 2% lithium content, used car battery is reused in static power storage. Also have you realised how much electricity is used to refine oil into petrol.
4634 2018-08-23 16:00:43 Hemp Fact:

4640 2018-08-23 16:00:36 I'm big into oil. I own lots of it and I know what it smells like. It's rich smelling. The smell itself spawns property and mansions.

4654 2018-08-23 16:00:02 Admission from @Konecna_K that she & other MEPs would welcome subjecting Malaysian smallfarmers to a life of poverty. Shocking attack on developing countries. Without oil palm cultivation, 650,000 MY small farmers would be without work, w/ no way of providing for their family.
4655 2018-08-23 16:00:02 "I misspoke; I meant to say something kind. Even less to shut up for the campaign. Or pancake syrup. Or motor oil. You never could tell.
4656 2018-08-23 16:00:02 Rahul Gandhi : Give me power I’ll give you ‘coconut oil’.
4657 2018-08-23 15:59:51 I’m skeptical bc I can’t understand anybody buying a 2017 GM with 45k miles, worn out tires, and no oil change for that close to a new price. Doesn’t make sense.
4658 2018-08-23 15:59:43 รอตอนเข้าเรียนที่ใหม่ก็ได้ค่ะ รอได้ อิ
4659 2018-08-23 15:59:38 Nope. That appears to be an original linoleum floor, made with linseed oil. They were usually put down with glue, so it will probably be impossible to remove. You'll have to replace the subfloor. Or clean it up and use it, because they last forever.
4660 2018-08-23 15:59:34 Can you point me to a data regarding this? Also, coconut oil is staple cooking oil in the coastal south. Other parts of India depends on vegetable oils.
4661 2018-08-23 15:59:31 Still not funny...#KathyGriffin humor and her are like oil and water.
4662 2018-08-23 15:59:27 Coconut oil is pure poison 

Said no one, ever, until some idiot PhD at Harvard
4663 2018-08-23 15:59:25 However many it takes for them to no longer own any of the farm land there?

4665 2018-08-23 15:59:15 My skin has finally gotten to the level where I don't need make-up and filter  anymore! thanks to carrot oil!
4666 2018-08-23 15:59:13 Psst Donny, you can't force other countries to buy your farm products. Trade doesn't work that way. Hey congratulations in your coal plans, everyone knows coal is the future, you can crush that stuff up and feed it to your car, it's cleaner than oil. #stablegenius
4667 2018-08-23 15:59:12 Please help me understand these findings because I disagree that coconut oil   is poisonous  Yes maybe for some but not for All because we have use it for generations. I t is helped our whole body inside & out. For me it’s helped my hair Grow back strong & healthy. I’m 53
4668 2018-08-23 15:59:10 I'm hearing ladies are taking coconut oil for cramps.

Is this true ? Does it work ??
4669 2018-08-23 15:59:10 in the past 2 days I got a smog check, oil change, annnnnd new tires lmfao I luv adulting
4670 2018-08-23 15:59:00 If life were an RPG...
Then snake oil would be a high demand potion component that's genuinely made of snakes. And oil.
4671 2018-08-23 15:59:00 Forgot I had to go get an oil change
4672 2018-08-23 15:58:55 Oh yes this is who I wanted to be when I grew up!
4673 2018-08-23 15:58:53 Which scent would you like the new Beardoholic beard oil to be? Help us decide :) Option 2:
4674 2018-08-23 15:58:52 I’ve used my own homemade spray works great for itchy scalp. Water, leave in conditioner and Jamaican Castor oil
4675 2018-08-23 15:58:51 Don’t worry about them, at least we have a history to talk about before 2008 *cough cough oil money*
4676 2018-08-23 15:58:43 What’re your thoughts on the coconut oil article?
4677 2018-08-23 15:58:39 The Church/Assembly/Congregation/Body of Messiah made up of Yisrael and Gentiles who believe but Yisrael is the oil & the wine and how powerful this is. Study.

Romans 11:24, 25 - The oil
John 15 - The vine
Revelation 6:6 (Deuteronomy 8:8)
Remember.
4678 2018-08-23 15:58:39 my dads best friend cured his skin cancer by putting cannabis oil from his marijuana plants on his cancer spots. i’ve watched him do it. he’s cancer free w no chemo
4679 2018-08-23 15:58:28 @oil_ken oilさん本当にありがとうございます！ランクマッチどうでしたか？これから応援してます！
4680 2018-08-23 15:58:27 Ahaha yeah moisturiser helps because if your skin lacks moisture, it will produce access oil to compensate. Toner helps to clear off oil and dirt for a clean base. I suggest to get alcohol free ones. Tbh search on shopee for cheaper makeup and skincare

4683 2018-08-23 15:58:06 My understanding is that the best course of action is to start training oil drillers to be astronauts.
4684 2018-08-23 15:58:05 Sadly he's probably on the payroll of companies producing refined "vegetable" oil products that the AHA keeps trying to pass of as healthy.
4685 2018-08-23 15:57:59 True. E.g.There is a lobby which works for soya oil (USA being the major producer) which time and again brings out some negative news on palm oil (Indonesia/Malaysia - major producer). Same will happen for coconut oil.
4686 2018-08-23 15:57:53 I hope it’s smell like the rock, which I imagine being coconut oil and success!
4687 2018-08-23 15:57:35 Took my car to get new tires and an oil change and they didnt change my oil? 
4688 2018-08-23 15:57:34 Great fireplace Hollie but you really need to stop smearing baby oil across your camera lens for that blurred effect 
4689 2018-08-23 15:57:30 I’ve always wondered why we call it an oil while it remains solid at room temp. Now we know! #FactsMatter

go and watch bro
4691 2018-08-23 15:57:11 @TastingTable Your article on EVOO is not 100% accurate. Cold pressed olive oil is not exclusive to EVOO. Did you mention expeller press?. This article could really give people the wrong impression about the differences between olive oils. I should know, grew up on olive farm.

4694 2018-08-23 15:56:57 Coconut oil is very high in saturated fats - even more that butter! Not a poison. But DEFINITELY not a super-food. #coconutoil #facts #HealthyNation #WorkoutMotivation
4695 2018-08-23 15:56:54 May not be slow but they turn like fucking oil tankers 
4696 2018-08-23 15:56:54 Broadly... historically excess oil revenues have gone to the central bank who have invested very conservatively in US Treasuries etc. - with the PIF more reliant on handouts. Now they want PIF to drive wider change through investment so need to raise cash

4702 2018-08-23 15:56:43 Te me has vuelto árabe... do you have oil?
4703 2018-08-23 15:56:22 台風来てるんやな
4704 2018-08-23 15:56:19 USA - Why did @CBSThisMorning present a story w/Karin Michels stating that coconut oil is "pure poison"?  Michels said it's in the same category as butter, lard, cheese & meat. So are those those substances were pure poison also? Then she states that coconut oil won't kill you.
4705 2018-08-23 15:56:16 4) model altogether, selling his (extremely stupid and gullible) audience things like overpriced gold or worthless “supplements”. Just new world snake oil nonsense. It helps that his audience is extremely stupid and gullible. But this is right wing media. It exists. Anyone who

4708 2018-08-23 15:55:52 That guy who wrote the coconut oil article is a CLOWN
4709 2018-08-23 15:55:47 I do not like checking my oil or doing any car maintenance to my vehicle besides putting gas(and barely that)  but I’m always single soooo
4710 2018-08-23 15:55:42 Damn.... I was taught to use coconut oil in a helmet to cook jungle 'food' when available during SERE School.....
4711 2018-08-23 15:55:37 I disagree. Part of the “cost push” is the result of a rapidly deteriorating peso. This can be partly mitigated by higher interest rates. A cheaper dollar & a steadier peso will help stabilise cost of imported inputs not to mention oil.
4712 2018-08-23 15:55:24 Oil is good!
4713 2018-08-23 15:55:22 Bwana dp..if kenya can afford the sgr;why not build a oil refinery in eldoret and clean the crude in kenya and sell the oil internally?why export?This will lower cost of business and stop this monster called PAYE tax
4714 2018-08-23 15:55:21 I mean in Doom 2016 he essentially gets roped into handling the aftermath of the UAC trying to acquire Hell's oil fields (argent energy) and in the process he just destroys everything they worked for without giving a fuck.
4715 2018-08-23 15:55:21 everytime i come to grease monkey they guys ask why i havent been there in so long like if i had to get an oil change every week

4717 2018-08-23 15:55:09 IMO it all dates back to the BP oil spill when the company dumped toxic chemicals to hide/sink the oil so it wouldn't show from arial views.
Three years after the dump people acted surprise there were no scallops.
4718 2018-08-23 15:55:06 Olive oil is very good for hair and gives it a shiny, moisturizing and nourishing effect, solving the problem of split ends in a few applications.  Just apply the oil directly to your hair, emphasizing the tip which will be the most damaged.
4719 2018-08-23 15:55:05 Great news well done Ben!
4720 2018-08-23 15:54:59 Can I ever get a oil change without recommendations 
4721 2018-08-23 15:54:56 They just want you to stop using your traditional ingredients and buy the snake oil they are peddling!
4722 2018-08-23 15:54:56 Not your best work. Coconut oil is to butter as poker is to football
4723 2018-08-23 15:54:56 Any food can be poisonous if eaten beyond normal limits....Oil especially is bad let it any make for consumption....But making such strong statements when ppl using it also don’t make is absurdity !!!!#coconutoil

4728 2018-08-23 15:54:33 Are you being poisoned by coconut oil?
4729 2018-08-23 15:54:29 ทับทิมก็สวยนะ
4730 2018-08-23 15:54:28 Is Cannabis oil the way forward?
4731 2018-08-23 15:54:27 No way to object to assumed facts not in evidence in the eye of the media. This was intentional, not a “mix up” , IMO. This guy sales snake oil, and he is good at it.
4732 2018-08-23 15:54:24 Can't wait for his olive oil
4733 2018-08-23 15:54:18 it's just not the one at all. And now they've found out that coconut oil is actually super unhealthy. Just a recipe for disaster

4741 2018-08-23 15:53:30 Because these HAVARD profs understood that people have rejected their claims which they published for CANOLA oil.

4755 2018-08-23 15:52:21 On the interview that he gave, he was so casual so nonchalant, no emotions, and knowing the fact that he had put his murdered children in a oil Barrel is absolutely frightening that he could act like that after doing such a horrible thing. There Are monsters among as, beware.

4757 2018-08-23 15:52:17 Yup combi skin but it leans more to oily. Moisturising before doing your base helps and if you need to blot off excess oil, just use tissue or blotting paper and you should be good
4758 2018-08-23 15:52:10 The USA is set to OVERTAKE Saudi Arabia as the world's number two oil producer this year, as shale companies, attracted by rising prices, ramp up drilling. I don't get my news from the fake news media. I Live the life! I lived it under Barry O' and I'm Living it Huge today!

4763 2018-08-23 15:51:16 Coconut oil is neither a ‘pure poison’ nor a ‘pure goodness’ oil. The truth lies somewhere in between. Compared to groundnut oil, sunflower oil, olive oil, gingelly oil, etc, coconut oil does have a slightly higher content of saturated and mono-unsaturated fatty acids.
4764 2018-08-23 15:51:16 My baby Sis not quite 50 is now a corporate CEO at some point She will have 2 move 2 Manhattan yet hopefully when big oil moves Her 2 CEO She can move 2 Houston & fly the leer jets back & forth Her thing is run marathons Memorial park is more suited 2 Her needs

4776 2018-08-23 15:50:19 And yet they say nothing about a white man who just killed his pregnant wife and 2 young daughters, stuff their bodies in oil tanks and feign concern all because he was having an affair. Great priorities there.

4785 2018-08-23 15:49:15 While I’ll never bought into the coconut oil hype, that seems pretty harsh. Wonder if there is a hidden agenda here?

4790 2018-08-23 15:49:06 Yayyy I just saw a thing like a week ago about oil and dog treats too with cbd but can’t find the post or remember the name and I want to get some ASAP
4791 2018-08-23 15:49:04 Za'atar is the spice of life, and olive oil is the elixir of life. All the rest is optional. Go ye and eat.

4795 2018-08-23 15:48:35 Cannot stand the smell of coconut oil 
4796 2018-08-23 15:48:34 No African country can afford to refine oil. They sell crude oil and import the refined product.
4797 2018-08-23 15:48:34 Currently watching Worlds belly flop contest while my cars getting an oil change.
4798 2018-08-23 15:48:30 I thought it smelled more like burnt oil.
4799 2018-08-23 15:48:22 Why don't you focus on what is going on in the US? Why haven't you said anything about the mother and two young daughters that were murdered by the husband/dad! Oh yes, them dumped into barrels of oil. Many, many being raped and murdered right here by fellow citizens.
4800 2018-08-23 15:48:22 I depend upon coconut oil for UV protection & apply the same with skin bòdy organ massage.
4801 2018-08-23 15:48:19 The oil market is impossible to not make a profit in. Nearly all available oil is used. When a state company can compete with Google or Amazon or IBM or Toyota or even General Frickin Mills I'll be impressed with government ownership.
4802 2018-08-23 15:48:01 Any specific oil mask? Girl my hair is DAMAGED
I need it fixed
4803 2018-08-23 15:47:48 All coconut oil is, is the plant-based version of butter/lard. If you think of it that way, it's not hard to understand.

4805 2018-08-23 15:47:38 @JKanyomozi  I get that, there are too many doctor's opinions. Don't stress with all. I think it is wise to stick to what most agree with: water is good, vegetables are good, olive oil is good, green tea is good, fruits are good, a little wine is definitely okay (1 Tim 5:23)...

4811 2018-08-23 15:46:55 CBD oil for the win every single time.
4812 2018-08-23 15:46:55 Put aside facts for a moment, as republicsns do indefinitely, this doesn’t even make sense. 

“I need to get an oil change. Wake up everybody. Illegal immigration kills.”
4813 2018-08-23 15:46:34 When are those Arab countries removing the dollar as a base currency for oil? That can really humble this arrogant bully called US.
4814 2018-08-23 15:46:27 okay I don't really go off on shit like this BC politics BUT WHAT KINDA GARBAGE yes ma'am ur a Harvard professor but you whites have said shit about coconut oil being shit in the past to promote the use of canola oil etc IN THE PAST TO INCREASE YOUR STOCKS
4815 2018-08-23 15:46:27 I use veggie broth most of the time in place of oil.
4816 2018-08-23 15:46:25 Kale is all of it! People put kale in EVERYTHING, eating tons of it. Uh oh! Too much kale will kill you! Kale is poison! 
Now coconut oil is all of it! Use coconut oil in EVERYTHING. Uh oh! Too much coconut oil will kill you! Coconut oil is poison!

4819 2018-08-23 15:46:11 also hey if you take supplements, take them with a cap of coconut oil! ~a tablespoon will help you absorb the supplement you’re taking better! 
4820 2018-08-23 15:46:08 You ever paid for an oil change and had a half of tank of gas but turned around and got a new car unexpectedly I want my gas and oil change money back
4821 2018-08-23 15:46:05 My plan to close Scotlands deficit is to ensure that all Scottish oil exported directly from the rigs and classed as of ‘unknown origin’ is reclassed as a Scottish export. In other words, we’ll declare independence and end British colonialism
4822 2018-08-23 15:45:34 It is truth that coconut oil gains weight but that can't be "PURE POISON"
4823 2018-08-23 15:45:33 You probably don't wanna know that in Texas, the same oil companies that muffled data on climate change...

...want the US and TX governments to pay for at least part of the walls/etc to protect their refineries from flooding.

4827 2018-08-23 15:45:25 All lanes now open on the #M602 eastbound in #GreaterManchester, within J1. Vehicles, debris, glass and oil from a traffic collision have been cleared. Delays on #M60 and #M62 approaches are now easing.
4828 2018-08-23 15:45:17 Why listen to politicians who don't understand the importance of oil and gas production on our soil. The Short term pain at the pump leads to long term gain. I have an advantage because I make my living in this field. It is the economy and I pray for results which we are getting!
4829 2018-08-23 15:45:14 Men kill women everyday. How about the guy who killed his wife and two daughters and stuffed their bodies in oil drums? Only news because of the disposition of the bodies. White guy though.

4835 2018-08-23 15:44:24 Dropped my car off to get my oil changed, the kid at the desk was outside, saw me coming, came running and already knew exactly who I was because the owner’s been taking care of my dad’s truck for 25 years and told him ahead of time I’d be there #advantagestolivinginasmalltown
4836 2018-08-23 15:44:16 Uhm who tf is accusing coconut oil of being pure poison ????cause they’re poison
4837 2018-08-23 15:43:59 Bro, you see Pacific Islanders with a daily coconut oil based diet, and they don’t show  the heart disease rates that you find in the occidental countries. It’s not like eat coconut oil and you are gonna die! Chill bro!
4838 2018-08-23 15:43:49 Oh no. Imagine banana chips in olive oil. Blasphemy.

4843 2018-08-23 15:43:34 Who cares the oil industry in Aberdeen is full of foreign workers on the shipping side, a blind eye is turned when U.K. seamen get well below minimum wage, then replaced by Jonny Foreigner.
4844 2018-08-23 15:43:16 8/ "Religious" leaders are not rocket scientists - they are, in fact,to a large extent, snake oil,salesmen, a la Joel Osteen, & the " prosperity" gospel... if you hate the people I tell you to hate, & give me a chunk of your money,you too will become fabulously wealthy & worldly.
4845 2018-08-23 15:43:13 @sudhirchaudhar Sir Research on coconuts oil may be a planed research, otherwise I will not be waching you as I used to eat coconut . Also as u said people of costal area who usually use these products. Hats of u for putting  DNA on vegetables.
4846 2018-08-23 15:43:12 I just found out coconut oil has a higher percentage of saturated fat than butter soooo back off @D_alexander57
4847 2018-08-23 15:43:07 sana oil may crush jk hahahaha may new crush ako hettt!!! kateammate q
4848 2018-08-23 15:42:58 tires are expensive af. oil changes are annoying. randomly getting an air filter. brakes and rotors lowkey over priced. EYE’M the one that has to PAY for it too?  i hate this part of adulthood
4849 2018-08-23 15:42:56 As part of the UK, Scotland, Wales and NI (11% of the population) are allocated 57% of total UK debt which seems questionable. Norway made £12.7 billion in 2018 in oil tax revenues.Spend wisely and be more efficient in revenue collection-it's not rocket science
4850 2018-08-23 15:42:53 I consume it daily and my heart/vitality is better than its ever been. Sounds like a study funded by vegetable oil companies
4851 2018-08-23 15:42:48 I don't think it beats "there's so much oil in this dish, the USA is about to invade it"
4852 2018-08-23 15:42:44 You can cook without oil.
4853 2018-08-23 15:42:33 The AMALGAMATION of  Nigeria by the British govt and their jihadists to steal oil and gas has expired. 1914 to 2014. REFERENDUM SOLVES THE PROBLEM.@realDonaldTrump
4854 2018-08-23 15:42:28 'We're fine'.

Are you? How do you know if eliminating saturated fats from your diet will have a positive health impact if you don't do it?

Btw, the topical application of coconut oil is harmless.

4857 2018-08-23 15:42:24 Chutzpah -- bet that's not the only great Yiddish word to define this oil industry move

4861 2018-08-23 15:42:00 If i write an incorrect code logic in production system , probably I would be shown doors. Why @Harvard keeping this poisonses professor in university. Either this guy is writing after lobbying with some oil company or he was high on concaine while writing this piece of shit.
4862 2018-08-23 15:41:50 Korea and Vietnam were all about stopping communism.
Kosovo was humanitarian...
Iraq was oil and regime change, more western arrogance.
Napoleon was a greatly admired leader, till he lost!
Mainly with Spanish help.
4863 2018-08-23 15:41:49 Should be declared as Harvard goofup of the decade. For times immemorial, people from Kerala, India have been consuming coconut oil as the primary major dietary constituent with no major deviation on their life expectancy or health.
4864 2018-08-23 15:41:48 they're sticky.  hence, the oil.
4865 2018-08-23 15:41:47 In my analysis, once Saudi understood they'd been shafted by Obama #TransitionThroughGas they switched new oil proceeds to Euro debt (so € QE was brought forward).  #EnergyDominance based on Saudi oil (Trump aware) & monetising US reserves (Trump unaware) puts $ on #OilStandard
4866 2018-08-23 15:41:45 Coconut Oil dangerous for you so says Harvard professor so says a Twitter headline. No facts that l could find to accompany the headline. This the quality of Jouralism we settle for today on social media.
4867 2018-08-23 15:41:39 @Target Why did your Simply balanced brand change their almond butter? It used to be just roasted almonds but now it has cane sugar, salt, and PALM OIL. It used to be the only almond butter I could find that did not have palm oil and reasonably priced. PLEASE CHANGE IT BACK!
4868 2018-08-23 15:41:35 Looking for CBD oil for my dog, just don’t know where to get some that is safe for pets :/
4869 2018-08-23 15:41:30 I just changed my oil, tire pressure, and had to have my air filter checked.  Gotta go back in a couple of months to have my oil done again and to keep an eye on my transmission.  Was told it looks like some issues can develop, so I’m gonna keep an eye on my car lol
4870 2018-08-23 15:41:26 Avocado oil is fab! It's got a mild flavour and actually has a higher smoke level than olive oil so you can cook things at a higher temp without it burning!  I've not used it in baking yet but I'm told it's a good coconut and olive oil substitute
4871 2018-08-23 15:41:26 Yeah know the pain.  Depending on the oil I breakout in hives for days. It sucks!!!

So take 52% divide by 3 then multiply by price of dollar for each year budget 
You welcome.

4877 2018-08-23 15:41:08 Coconut oil and ghee! Ayurvedic practices are healthy and US docs never take the total nutrition picture into account...
4878 2018-08-23 15:41:04 'Fluculations in oil revenues' Norway has a $1trillion sovereign wealth fund.  It raised £20 billion in oil revenue 2017/18 exluding dividends. The UK managed £1.1 bn.
4879 2018-08-23 15:41:01 Yeah, if I remember right, that was right before the oil crisis in the late 70’s when the Iranian’s had our hostages etc.  

Technology has come a long way since the 70’s, but they were WAY off.
4880 2018-08-23 15:40:47 I dread getting my oil changed so much... I’m thinking about just buying a new car

if you don't want to fry in a pan, make sure you put oil in the water when boiling so they don't stick.

4902 2018-08-23 15:39:09 Absolutely.
Even really simple things self organise into complex patterns.
If you heat a pan of cooking oil, it transitions through a point where it self organises into hexagonal convection cells.
Maybe cooking oil is intelligent???
4903 2018-08-23 15:39:05 I wasn't sure how it would turn out so I stuck pretty close to the recipe which was a simple garlic hummus. But! I did make some Aleppo chile oil to top it with and it is DIVINE.

4926 2018-08-23 15:36:32 Exactly!  There are good saturated fats and bad saturated fats.  There is obviously money involved in this claim that coconut oil is poison!
4927 2018-08-23 15:36:28 This same logic is applied by the federal government in assessing Canada's contribution to global emissions - it is conveniently calculated to omit those gases emanating from exported oil and gas products (not to mention deforestation, and fires due to clear-cut practices).

4929 2018-08-23 15:36:23 Put cooking oil on the finger and the pain will stop 
4930 2018-08-23 15:36:22 Another vague theory to stop People from having healthy food.. and down the line they themself will bring coconut based oil saying healthy ones
4931 2018-08-23 15:36:21 All of above shows business STRATEGY. Globle   STRAGY.  Original coconut oil gives us more relief. It's Indian culture. I experiened. It's my personnel opinion. Sorry for the inconveince

4939 2018-08-23 15:35:51 Well, they had to work hard but they made it. Idiots can do everything, even kill an economy rich of oil revenues. First rule: never underestimate the power of idiocy
4940 2018-08-23 15:35:41 And we can totally leave our NATO bases. I’m sure your Russian oil will flow just as freely. With no more in return. Just ask Crimea.

4944 2018-08-23 15:35:22 there is always the microwaveable cup-cake pans, too. spray with oil and  go for it. Plus Ore Ida has the 'add and egg and microwave' thingies,  now.

4950 2018-08-23 15:34:53 Hi. Thanks for responding so quickly about Palm oil but was querying about the plantations for your cocoa beans. Are they sustainably farmed too? Am aware that some chocolate companies use plantations where clearing of rain forest takes place.
Thanks in advance.

4953 2018-08-23 15:34:49 Saying coconut oil is healthy is as crazy aa saying it is 'pure poison.'
4954 2018-08-23 15:34:46 I just bought my first Jeep Patriot 2 weeks ago.  I also have a Subaru.  I Love the Subaru but hated the long drive to the dealership for simple oil changes and many repairs.  Got tired of dumping money into it.
4955 2018-08-23 15:34:41 They said the same thing about olive oil in the 60s and 70s. Now its the healthiest. Relax.
4956 2018-08-23 15:34:34 Hi Douglas, any info?
You do realise that when Norway discovered oil it was a very poor country.
Since North Sea oil was discovered, Scotland has produced more than Norway and yet, somehow, we have a deficit.
Can you possibly explain how this has come about?

4964 2018-08-23 15:34:01 It’s fairly healthy too. As long as the sauce you make is light on the olive oil and the linguini is a reasonable portion.
4965 2018-08-23 15:33:55 lol dunno why people don't just use real olive oil, or how about when cooking with any oil using an extremely small amount.
4966 2018-08-23 15:33:54 guy at jiffy lube: you need a new battery

4968 2018-08-23 15:33:39 A number of scientists(Dr.Mary Newport)claim that coconut oil is useful for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease.Their allegations are confirmed by the inhabitants of tropical countries.

4978 2018-08-23 15:32:46 #NDTV is accusing that BJP’s favourable policies for workforce in Oil sector is for its political benefits. It is unbelievable that one of the most intellectual sect. of the society i.e. media persons, are playing such games and creating news out of baseless assumptions.
4979 2018-08-23 15:32:36 I think good old bob here just fired up the Furnace to burn some pigs ... which one is first ??? Let me see here i think this one with the golden Loks he is pretty much screaming as if his pants were on fire. And positive byproduct is the fat turns into useful grease oil.
4980 2018-08-23 15:32:34 Research shows that people who eat popcorn cooked in coconut oil are %900 happier than the humorless scolds who criticize them.

I know which group I'm in.
4981 2018-08-23 15:32:31 I guess I have to buy nutritional yeast to create a vegan cheese sauce because most vegan packed cheese has coconut oil in it

4984 2018-08-23 15:32:06 The professor was trying to point out the fact that no oil is a health food. The popular view by almost 30% of the people surveyed believed that coconut oil was a health food. Maybe confused with kale or spinach?
#coconutoil oil is not going to cure tumors or stop inflammation.

4991 2018-08-23 15:31:37 Wait for the follow up article  They will soon launch something. For good fatty acid ratio we need saturated fats as well. Coconut oil has MCT should not be given high heat treatment. It’s always good to use 2 to 3 types of oils & coconut is great :)
4992 2018-08-23 15:31:13 I am not sure, but in Arabian Nights stories there is a story that when Sindbad got ship wrecked in an island, monsters gave them coconut oil mixed rice so that prisoners get fat and monsters later eat them. Apparently coconut oil is full of fat concept is older than we think.
4993 2018-08-23 15:31:10 If I was the reviewer of this article , will outrightly reject it.
1. This test was done on the non users of this kind of oil.
2. Whether participants food habit is par.
3. What the geo condition, if it is same as naturally producing area of oil.
4. Microbiome & metabolomics ?

5019 2018-08-23 15:29:38 Sure but they also depend on Oil for everything. If they mess off too much like becoming a state sponsor of terrorism again, Trump will cut off the spigot. They have lots of reasons to behave so sharia law takes a back seat.

5029 2018-08-23 15:29:05 Wow did we get a drop of oil back from there rich fields .
5030 2018-08-23 15:28:52 Is it possible that there are significant genetic differences among populations that could explain the results? Lactose intolerance is genetic, for example. Some populations may have evolved without much exposure to coconut oil.
5031 2018-08-23 15:28:51 Took my bitch to get an oil change
5032 2018-08-23 15:28:49 Good point - what happens if (when?) CNY oil contract also affects underlying capital & trade flows to the benefit of China?  Because this is clearly appears to be what China's goal is...

5038 2018-08-23 15:28:40 Talking points 101. I'm in the oil/gas industry. NOTHING has changed that would hurt the environment. What you're not told is, the regs Trump is killing, are the redundant ones that do the same thing, but cost three times as much. Obama was trying to FORCE clean energy with cost.
5039 2018-08-23 15:28:38 When was the last time you really thought about your olive oil? Sure, maybe you take a few minutes to scan the many options in the grocery aisle before selecting one (usually the one on sale, if you're me) — but do you ever pause to truly consider how that olive oil made it …

5045 2018-08-23 15:28:17 かーなりやばめ
5046 2018-08-23 15:28:17 There is no credible research that disputes that Harvard study.  In fact, everyone is pretty much in agreement.  It was already well known that C oil is over 60% saturated fat.  Consumed In excess, it’s not good for you.  You made a judgement without looking at the whole story.

5073 2018-08-23 15:26:52 Friends of the Earth calls for ban on acid stimulation of onshore oil and gas wells - the risks are similar to those for #fracking, the regulations aren't strong enough and there are huge gaps in knowledge and transparency,

5076 2018-08-23 15:26:43 deny the fact & truth,isis=israel like Assad did not kill 600000 his own people.  arabs always deny the truth , that why the arabs countries did not succeed even they are very rich . and Israel without oil sources successfull. isis=Israel like the sun rises west.
5077 2018-08-23 15:26:43 Nothing like going to get a “free” oil change and having to pay over 800 bucks for new tires....#Ijustcant
5078 2018-08-23 15:26:42 Pls include South Indians , they also eat coconut oil and liberally use coconut .
5079 2018-08-23 15:26:35 I've priced Avocado oil. I would die from starvation if I had to buy it regularly.
5080 2018-08-23 15:26:22 Oil paint blends well hehe
5081 2018-08-23 15:26:17 Daily reminder that if you stick your fork into a hot pan of frying oil, maybe, just maybe, that fork might be very very hot and you shouldn't put it into your mouth

5084 2018-08-23 15:26:04 Isn’t the tourist/outdoor economy far more positive for the state than oil/gas/coal?
5085 2018-08-23 15:26:02 Texas Exports More Oil Than It Imports For First Time Ever |
you can Thank President Trump's Sec of Energy - Rick Perry
former governor of Texas the greatest state in Union
5086 2018-08-23 15:25:53 This is a long term project . Surely you do not expect them to reap benefits this early ? Show us where in this worldwomen reap benefits from oil discoveries in less than six years !
5087 2018-08-23 15:25:52 Trump is afraid his American based companies will loose more if Land was to be Expropriated just like the attempt in Iraq on Oil - Trump must just shut and seat on his California million dollar couch and brush his hair #LandExpropriation
5088 2018-08-23 15:25:48 Saudi Arabia has abandoned plans for a stock market listing of its state-owned oil colossus, #Aramco, in a setback for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s push for reform.
5089 2018-08-23 15:25:48 To prevent them from slippery floors when the oil spill
5090 2018-08-23 15:25:47 Interesting that this came out at the same time US soybean industry was  hit with retaliatory tariffs.
This might be a ploy to boost soybean oil sales!
5091 2018-08-23 15:25:44 wouldn’t be talking about it unless I had some knowledge she’s right about oil extraction has to/
5092 2018-08-23 15:25:41 The controversy on coconut oil: that shit bad for you. That’s the real tea.
5093 2018-08-23 15:25:40 We want #GreenEnergy NOW! Get big oil $$ out of politics. It’s killing us.
5094 2018-08-23 15:25:38 Been feeling like crap lately...

*pours holy oil
5095 2018-08-23 15:25:34 But even if you're implying that you could burn the fat out...unless you just enjoy the taste of coconut oil, why even add those saturated fats to your meal from the beginning anyway when there are healthier options?
5096 2018-08-23 15:25:32 Coconut oil is consumed mostly in a few states in India, mostly in the state of Kerala where the average life expectancy in 2015 is 75. The rest of India use other oils.
5097 2018-08-23 15:25:16 When any traditional oil gains popularity the the dubious oil exporters become busy with fake doctors.
5098 2018-08-23 15:25:12 How are mainland Americans different from residents of Hawaii, Philippines, and Thailand? We have absolutely no clue how to consume our fad foods in moderation. Coconut oil in large quantities isn’t good for you but you already know that.
5099 2018-08-23 15:25:07 No idea if their rumored huge privatization investment in Tesla is a good idea but plowing their oil riches into the next generation of renewable energy seems logical
5100 2018-08-23 15:24:57 Totally agree with you!!! I grew up in Philippines and we used coconut oil all the time. If its a poison then many people had died but why is it that the population is still growing and growing.
5101 2018-08-23 15:24:56 Fake News: Saturated fats are long chain triglycerides that ranges from C16-18. Coconut oil is composed majorly of Medium Chain Triglycerides that goes str8 to liver for energy. While it has trace amounts of C16-18 it works in harmony with the medium chains for overall health.
5102 2018-08-23 15:24:54 Something something, muh slave trade.

5107 2018-08-23 15:24:47 It gets crazy trying to balance Arab and Iranian politics, when there is no longer, truly, an affordable price for oil, because the Quality cheap to get oil is almost gone! Asprin anyone?

5109 2018-08-23 15:24:34 Listen we’re the number one oil producer in the world right now. We’re not getting enough oil from anyone to make a difference these days.
5110 2018-08-23 15:24:32 Just read an article saying coconut oil was one of the worst things you can eat... I was like... hmmm have you never heard of a poptart or mountain dew... lol pretty sure there are lots of things that rake much worse! 
5111 2018-08-23 15:24:24 that harvard professor that called coconut oil poison...fake!! lies!!
5112 2018-08-23 15:24:12 Was is these type of special appliances that were sent to the buncfield oil depot fire?
5113 2018-08-23 15:24:10 I'm really worried about an asteroid or comet hitting our planet, but I'm even more worried about depleting oil reserves @dougmcneall
5114 2018-08-23 15:24:09 To revive damaged, dry hair, apply an olive oil mask to your scalp. Just apply the oil all over your hair and then put a shower bag on it as it is plastic and does not stain. Time 30-45 minutes rinse with warm water and then wash your hair as usual.

5117 2018-08-23 15:23:57 If I didn’t get free oil changes I would never get anything done at a dealership.
5118 2018-08-23 15:23:56 They have reduced the groundnut oil in condom, and nobody is saying anything about it. 
Y'all just kept quiet.
5119 2018-08-23 15:23:33 No I’m pretty sure the saturated fats in coconut oil bond differently due to the temperature at which I cook my eggs

5123 2018-08-23 15:23:27 For pain relief (in the experience of a friend who died from bowel+liver cancer &treated his pain this way up until the last month, when he took up morphine) it's seemingly best to use CBD oil that has THC still in it. At small doses, it won't get him high. That's all I know, soz

5125 2018-08-23 15:23:24 God the waiting room for getting my car's oil changed has MSNBC on and it's insufferable. Every fucking thing they've said is a lie. This isn't news, it's theater for the retarded.

5127 2018-08-23 15:23:13 She's no oil painting
5128 2018-08-23 15:23:13 Very funny that "Cansas University" described "survival for the laziest " & so the coconut oil for Harvad prof .
5129 2018-08-23 15:23:12 In the past week, I had my annual ObGyn, incl Pap & Mammogram. Saw my Psych this morning & got all my many scrips sent direct to the pharmacy. This afternoon, I get the oil changed & tires rotated. It all feels very much of a piece.
5130 2018-08-23 15:23:10 We don’t seem to have any shame in this country, cos if we have shame ni a man that was VP for eight years and put in charge of excess crude oil money will not say such a thing. @atiku
5131 2018-08-23 15:23:08 Thanks. It’s made from the best oil paint on the best quality canvas and consequently it has a kind of solid quality to it also.
5132 2018-08-23 15:22:59 Have been consuming coconut oil from birth. Still around to tweet about it. #coconutoil #purepoison
5133 2018-08-23 15:22:54 Black ppl use ALOT of coconut oil  every natural haired woman you see uses it
5134 2018-08-23 15:22:52 i finally got around to doing the 8 hour 800 oil one and i almost!!! dipped below 3k lmao
5135 2018-08-23 15:22:52 Coconut Oil is wonderful. He’s a big fat liar. He’s probably being paid by Canola Oil. What’s a canola???
5136 2018-08-23 15:22:51 I watched that PBS grilling show a few days ago and he cooked a whole eggplant in the embers of a grill, pulled off the skin and made baba ganoush. He also sprinkled sesame seeds on some pita, brushed it with olive oil and toasted them over the coals. I’m STILL thinking about it.

5138 2018-08-23 15:22:44 @TanaAmen Hi, what do you think about coconut oil?
5139 2018-08-23 15:22:25 Y’all took away Eco gel but I will not tolerate coconut oil slander!
5140 2018-08-23 15:22:16 Big Oil reaps billions in net profits every quarter, yet whines for taxpayer help even as the firms ratchet up the price of gasoline and other products. Despicable.
5141 2018-08-23 15:22:03 NOW WE'RE COOKING WITH PEANUT OIL BOYS AND GIRLS!
5142 2018-08-23 15:21:56 Before the excessive oil on my face melt off my makeup does anyone wanna admit they got a crush on me 
5143 2018-08-23 15:21:55 That professor calling coconut oil "pure poison" is like those meme's where people say ketchup or water is too spicy for them 
5144 2018-08-23 15:21:50 One of my favorite bits of race trivia: Americans used to think of Arabs as white until the oil crisis in the 1970's when they were downgraded.

Likewise, Jews were upgraded to white after the Holocaust.

No DNA changed in either case, just perception.
5145 2018-08-23 15:21:48 Alaskans own 200,034 shares of TRANSOCEAN LTD, worth $2,490,423. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in SWITZERLAND.
5146 2018-08-23 15:21:44 @teaboardofindia Supply of gas is disrupted for last many days. Even Assam Gas company ltd is not taking the matter seriously and is not assuring of any disinterrupted supply and blaming Oil India Limited for not supplying Gas to them  which is only shifting of blame.
5147 2018-08-23 15:21:42 FFS the UK borrows money on the basis of our oil revenues and reserves. Why didn’t the interviewer question him on that?
5148 2018-08-23 15:21:39 Treat it like olive oil. It's ok sometimes. You can smoke cigs till your 90 sometimes. Still doesn't mean it's the best.
5149 2018-08-23 15:21:36 Funny enough, that would still be protecting their oil refineries. :B
5150 2018-08-23 15:21:30 My wife has had Parkinson’s for 20 yrs. I give her 3 tablespoon coc oil per day, not a cure but sure eases symptoms. When missed dosage symptoms increase. Doesn’t sound like poison to me.
5151 2018-08-23 15:21:20 Did you know....CBD oil helps our Endocannabinoid System keep our bodies in proper balance/homeostasis. It is also a great thing to take to maintain health before a chronic problem arises.
#CBDoil
5152 2018-08-23 15:21:08 Yeah. Since the creation of the FED, US economy has gone from bubble to bust. 1920s FL land boom, 1970s savings & loans. 1990s the .coms, 2008, real estate market. You site oil bubble, need to import from China. I guess those 2 ought to burst the bubble. Then rebuild the economy
5153 2018-08-23 15:21:07 I wonder who sponsored his "research" to tell people to eat unhealthy, super process, man-made canola as a healthier option makes me wonder. Coconut oil has a much longer history for health so I think you'll be ok xD
5154 2018-08-23 15:21:07 -Workout 4x a week(take rest)

-shower and apply deodorant 

-apply castor oil and coconut oil on eyebrows and eyelashes

-drink enough water daily

-take care of skin (cleanse,tone,moisturize,exfoliate,and use fase masks
5155 2018-08-23 15:21:05 "So it would seem that coconut oil would be bad news for our hearts. ... But plant-based oils are more than just fats." ...AND I don't think anyone would be drinking 100g of coconut oil in a go. #moderation is key.
5156 2018-08-23 15:21:05 And yet just before the Scottish referendum the Good old BBC reported the North sea oil had dried up 
5157 2018-08-23 15:21:02 Do this instead of breakfast, don't drink fat and eat, it's too much. The ghee is good, i prefer real butter, and use MCT oil also

Also, try and cut your carbs as low as you can through all your meals, cut out the rice / potatoes / pasta  and add double salad or veggies
5158 2018-08-23 15:20:58 マミュッカナイトしようね
5159 2018-08-23 15:20:52 Lets say Trump is the best businessman, no one is better. Is it worth it? Our schools are run by a billionaire who thinks education should be private. Our EPA is run by a billionaire who thinks oil should rule, Women's rights are curtailed, racism is prevalent and encouraged.
5160 2018-08-23 15:20:43 They’re talking about the saturated fat content which is very high in the processed oil from regular coconuts.  In moderation, it’s fine.  The oils from virgin coconuts is a lot better.  This is  old news actually.

5164 2018-08-23 15:20:25 Because a very small group of people oppose, and US competitors have been paying to halt Canadian oil reaching the coast, you think that equals a great effort to stop it? Clearly you’ve not seen a poll. Support for the pipeline is overwhelming.
5165 2018-08-23 15:20:24 Could say that but I'm not sure we're told the whole story, especially where oil is involved. Democratic Socialist countries in Scandinavian countries seems to be doing ok ..
5166 2018-08-23 15:20:12 All I can do is laugh at this research and feel pity on the people/ group funded it. Millions of people have used coconut oil in their food in good health across the world for generations!!!
5167 2018-08-23 15:20:12 P is going to start him on Vitamin E oil as soon possible, especially since they are on his face.

5170 2018-08-23 15:20:04 That witch hunt is sure turning up a lot of witches.

As far as Papadopoulos being a low level guy, Trump called him "an energy and oil consultant, excellent guy".

It's OK, the investigation has access to all his emails. They have a good handle on what he knew and who he told.

5173 2018-08-23 15:19:46 Bro it's not fine, there's no light to tell you oil has lost viscosity.
5174 2018-08-23 15:19:39 Well said. Just to clarify 100g coconut oil contains about 87g of saturated fats. "Too much saturated fat in the diet is unhealthy because it raises "bad" LDL cholesterol levels, which increases the risk of heart disease."
5175 2018-08-23 15:19:39 One of the Bruhz better have some oil Saturday  need that .

5177 2018-08-23 15:19:36 And yet CIA helps fund terrorists overseas.

5193 2018-08-23 15:18:49 Not fighting with you. We have realities we have to deal with. We have more oil than Saudi Arabia so WHY are we buying oil - at all?

5195 2018-08-23 15:18:33 Try to take some time for self care every day whatever that looks like for you. Having a little nightly routine of yoga and meditation helps me tremendously. Also healing herbal tinctures like holy basil, lemon balm and Copiaba oil can work tremendously. Often better than meds.
5196 2018-08-23 15:18:27 *face plants the floor* I think I just ate half a plate of “brownies” or fudge I honestly don’t know the difference I blame the milk instead of water and oil. Oh also pudding makes a good dipping side
5197 2018-08-23 15:18:24 & it’s weird bc most men don’t do shit for their skin or anything. Use generic bar soap, no creams/oil, sunscreen or whatever
5198 2018-08-23 15:18:21 In terms of the recent GERS figures....is it not proof that the United Kingdom, doesn’t only fail Scotland, but fails the British isles as a whole? Isn’t it proof that mismanagement of oil in particular, comparing to Norway’s oil fun, has been a failure of UK Governments?! #GERS

5206 2018-08-23 15:17:51 This project is NOT in the “national interest”. It is a handout, YET AGAIN, to Big Oil. Your government is dreaming if you think that pipeline will be built. Who bought you, Notley?  Who runs the show?  Its not you.

5207 2018-08-23 15:17:50 If I recall, most of them were from Saudi Arabia but of course we couldn't go to war with America'a oil ally so we in turn attacked other Muslim countries in the region. A terrorist attack from a group doesn't warrant the death of 2 million people.
5208 2018-08-23 15:17:45 Oye!My grandmother lives on coconut oil.. She's 90 and fit as a horse.while my american wali chachu has every NCD from every McD he ate.
5209 2018-08-23 15:17:39 Did they report on the white citizen father that put his toddler girls in a vat of oil?

5212 2018-08-23 15:17:29 Soak in hot water 1st. Boil in salt until tender for 30mins + 
Dry them thoroughly 
Fry in oil until dry and crisp
DONT LEAVE THEM SOFTENED I REPEAT FRY THEM UNTIL CRISP
Add salt or pepper & onion
5213 2018-08-23 15:17:21 Deadass! I’m OVER this coconut oil slander
5214 2018-08-23 15:17:19  putting on coconut oil on your eyelashes before going to sleep is a good way to grow eyelashes and make them look shiny and healthy 
 go on walk 1-3 times a week before winter for some good excercise and some alone time 
 get into a good mindset, try to be more positive
5215 2018-08-23 15:17:18 We are dependent on each other, you get more oil from us than Saudi Arabia, that's why trump picking fights with us is stupid, not as stupid as a Canadian/american border wall.
5216 2018-08-23 15:17:16 I just started using deva curl! It works so well I think I need to add like an oil or hell to it bc it’s still always frizzy 
5217 2018-08-23 15:17:09 Then we either keep buying our oil from murderers like the dictators we do now or stop using all oil and petroleum products! You first!
5218 2018-08-23 15:17:06 20% OFF Does Oil Tankers!
5219 2018-08-23 15:17:05 Pl read the article since it is not mentioned for us only threatening UK people to stop buying coconut oil. 
UK usage had multiplied hence a general gyan being floated to create fuss.
Let us all stand united & NOT deviate from our traditional practice..
5220 2018-08-23 15:16:57 what's wrong with coconut oil?!?!
5221 2018-08-23 15:16:56 Why are people spouting conspiracy theories of corruption without actually looking up the facts? . Processed Coconut oil is over 60% saturated fat. So it is a poison if it’s over-used.  This was already well known.  In moderation, it has healthy properties.
5222 2018-08-23 15:16:48 Sir Pl regulate oil prices, petrol has breached 80 in Bangalore. No point in daily revision. It's only a masked cheating @narendramodi @PMOIndia

5226 2018-08-23 15:16:38 This from @theSNP that proposed separation withough having decided on currency, and having an economic plan predicated on an oil price of $114 what a #brassneck
5227 2018-08-23 15:16:34 The NFL knows its fans — and they like beer and pizza. The 30+ companies that pay to be “official” NFL sponsors include Castrol (motor oil), Bridgestone (tires), Anheuser-Busch InBev (beer), USAA (military insurance), Ford (trucks) — and now Pizza Hut.
5228 2018-08-23 15:16:32 Olicity is the viscosity measurement of motor oil.
5229 2018-08-23 15:16:24 ！？
5230 2018-08-23 15:16:24 #NDTV is accusing that BJPs favourable policies for workforce in Oil sector is for its political benefits. It is unbelievable that one of the most intellectual sect. of the society i.e. media persons, are playing such games things and creating news out of baseless facts.
5231 2018-08-23 15:16:21 More like they tried to cook the eggs in oil and not butter, when butter is clearly the superior way to cook with eggs.

5236 2018-08-23 15:15:50 This takes me back almost 30 years, to my days as a young commodity broker. Three of us newbies were sitting around talking about the Valdez oil spill since we had few trading customers. The suggestion was made that wheat should be used to soak up the oil. 
Not much has changed.

5239 2018-08-23 15:15:34 Well a lot of indian people are fat, especially after moving abroad. Assuming people do more work whilst in India. Would be interesting to see a study on coconut oil consumption and related health issues & weight.

5245 2018-08-23 15:15:03 coconut oil isn’t poison unless you’re consuming a jar of it a day  y’all are just mad fewer people are buying butter.
5246 2018-08-23 15:14:59 We need to pour more oil into the ocean and burn diesel to save the environment!!
5247 2018-08-23 15:14:54 Argan, coconut, or olive oil.
5248 2018-08-23 15:14:53 Lord have mercy pep boys is BUSSSYYYY I just need you to start my oil change
5249 2018-08-23 15:14:44 Coconut oil is the only oil which contains "sodium mono louric acid "which is the basis of human immune system.the oil is the best germ killer  ,Harvard university is hand in glove with so called "wall street greed" they have made India into  a diabetic capital.
5250 2018-08-23 15:14:39 That was few months after their wasteful 8years in the saddle of leadership, where sex was the yard stick to get an oil rig. Now he is wailing about a corp member helped in katsina who came to serve there few weeks ago.
5251 2018-08-23 15:14:32 Coconut oil is 82 percent saturated fat!
5252 2018-08-23 15:14:32 Haha the West is drowning in delusions. Coconut oil is used for cooking for EVERY meal in Kerala where Westerners throng to restore their broken bodies and minds at Ayurvedic "spas".1000s of years of experience vs Western science which keeps falling over its own limitations daily
5253 2018-08-23 15:14:32 There are many dealers in Oil sector, that underpay their employees at the petrol pumps to counter that government made it mandatory for every dealer to pay his/her labours minimum wages directly into the bank account. All credit goes to @narendramodi @dpradhanbjp.
5254 2018-08-23 15:14:30 Gets things done. Yeah right. He’s a corrupt artist selling snake oil. Quit watching Fox News.

5257 2018-08-23 15:14:18 Something that #KSA has in abundance is not only #OIL but #SUN. and #Wind (given the extension of the country). Hence, by adopting the @Tesla technology, KSA may have the chance to run free #energy and divert into the PIF the revenues of Aramco.... as Statoil does with Norges....

5262 2018-08-23 15:13:56 This is today's mainstream advice. They throw a bone to olive oil, but cast it as equivalent to seed oils. Since latter are cheaper, people buy them.
5263 2018-08-23 15:13:55 Everyone thinks that because we grow up on the Islands full of coconut we put that on breakfast, lunch and dinner ... that we way that every time. WE DO NOT. In fact you eat to much and get diarrhea! THAT OIL IS POISON!
5264 2018-08-23 15:13:49 Still haven’t heard all the outrage about the white father murdering his wife and children and putting them in crude oil yet Joe. Still waiting
5265 2018-08-23 15:13:47 @sundarpichai @satyanadella  all used coconut oil...
5266 2018-08-23 15:13:44 sana oil
5267 2018-08-23 15:13:36 Ohhh. Well either way, I know how to check my oil and add oil.. I just never do. Oops lol
5268 2018-08-23 15:13:35 I would rather cook with coconut oil than Rapeseed oil,sunflower oil...
5269 2018-08-23 15:13:30 Doubtful that @POTUS chooses music, someone who put the even together is likely who planned the song--get over it, the economy is booming, jobs opening, manufacturing, oil & gas rockin' --you whine about a song for Trump rally. Millennials no fun, take yourselves too seriously.
5270 2018-08-23 15:13:29 Has anyone checked under Flint Michigan to see if there is oil, gas, gold or some other resource? Because that is the only reason why a government hasn't stepped in to fix that mess.. they are emptying the city by attrition.
5271 2018-08-23 15:13:26 Caffeine/Sugar is just as much poison as is Coconut oil so I’m not tryna hear that shit
5272 2018-08-23 15:13:25 I've used coconut oil on my face & in my hair for years. I'm running low too, better go get some more...
5273 2018-08-23 15:13:22 Things went well under Chavez for a while. This was when the EFF brains trust visited.  Problem was as soon as the oil market tanked (from 100 USD to 50 USD), the entire country systematically collapsed.

We're following this model - on minerals - i.e. already flailing market 
5274 2018-08-23 15:13:21 こっちも揺れてます…
5275 2018-08-23 15:13:17 I oil my here once a week and leave it in for 30-40 mints and wash it afterwards. That helps with the frizziness pretty 
5276 2018-08-23 15:13:17 You’re only Virgin you can be is 
1) a Virgo
2) olive oil
 And you neither so
5277 2018-08-23 15:13:14 I have never used cuticlr oil in my life and I don’t think today is going to be different, sorry sis
5278 2018-08-23 15:13:10 Facts certainly don't suggest that nor do they suggest a repeat of the Nixon debacle. I have often written that Nixon cost the stock mkt less than 10%. The bigger issues at the time were the oil, the Fed, oil, inflation and oil, all leading to a weak economy and low confidence
5279 2018-08-23 15:13:09 Coconut my favorite.. I cook with the oil, use it on my hair,skinI don't care what studies say..coconut and I are buddies forever studies wld make u paranoid,I eat everything in moderation..Ppl hv such an obsession 2b right these days,that they wld eliminate facts
5280 2018-08-23 15:13:05 That disclaimer about coconut oil’s benefits could only have been made by a buffoon and a shill. Quackery. Trans fats were as good as a death sentence for many.

5282 2018-08-23 15:12:58 While the price of #fossilfuels such as #oil are subject to heavy fluctuations in the international markets, the price of #wood and #pellets is stable, making it the sensible choice for your heating system. Call us today on 01613022851 to find out about #Biomass solutions
5283 2018-08-23 15:12:52 Coconut oil is the new tide pod
5284 2018-08-23 15:12:49 An oil change isn’t the same as needing oil in your car. You’re still  supposed to put oil in your car in between oil changes, because most cars have oil leaks no matter how slight.
5285 2018-08-23 15:12:45 Antivaxer logic: 
Food and essential oils heal all things my kid wont ever get polio or measles because I use lemon oil on their temples and feed them a tomato before bed
5286 2018-08-23 15:12:43 I had the cherry wine shake and made a topical oil that was amazingly effective. Their ACDC surpassed a local dispensaries version too
5287 2018-08-23 15:12:21 Modi Govt. has enabled labour friendly policies in Oil sector to work. Bringing in digital transparencies with Adhar card and other personal information to overcome discrepancies over the wages imparted to these labours.

5288 2018-08-23 15:12:18 Oil and gas production may disrupt sensitive habitat. And nuclear waste may be dumped in deserts, which have also been used as nuclear testing grounds.
5289 2018-08-23 15:12:18 And still in souther India we hv healthy people after years of consumption of coconut oil.

Seems that this poison works for us. So we don't bother abt wht diz ppl r saying.

We must ignore thn, ty r the ppl who said in early 1900, that cigarette smoking is good for health
5290 2018-08-23 15:12:18 @allamericanchev 2 hour wait for a scheduled oil change 
5291 2018-08-23 15:12:13 Listen at the end of your life the only one who is laying in your coffin is you. If you like coconut oil then freakin use it. If you don’t, then don’t. Butttttt please don’t let a Harvard professor be the one that makes the decision for you.
5292 2018-08-23 15:12:10 Is it a cooking oil tho?
5293 2018-08-23 15:12:10 Dr Karin might have got funds from other oil companies to say (coconut oil poison).
5294 2018-08-23 15:11:58 Let me bring you some olive oil and take it over the top.
5295 2018-08-23 15:11:58 I need to pick up some peppermint oil so I can breathe out of my nose 
5296 2018-08-23 15:11:51 How? Just say how David. We are in the lowest unemployment numbers and best economic growth in decades.  So how? How will you do it? What EXACTLY will you do? You don’t know. Other than spewing your party master’s talking points.  You are a pathetic snake oil salesman @AlexisinNH
5297 2018-08-23 15:11:27 TUNE IN: @Nasdaq's energy analyst Tamar Essner will join @SeanaNSmith on "Midday Movers" @YahooFinance at 11:40 a.m. ET to discuss the latest oil market trends. #energy $WTI #crudeoil #IRChat
5298 2018-08-23 15:11:24 Still pushed. From USA Today hit piece on coconut oil: "Donald Hensrud, medical director of the Mayo Clinic Healthy Living Program...recommends...oils high in monounsaturated fats (including olive oil and avocado oil) and those high in polyunsaturated fats (such as canola oil). "

5301 2018-08-23 15:11:05 The Arctic, onshore and offshore, contains vital energy resources that can reduce the Nation's dependence on foreign oil and improve the national balance of payments.
5302 2018-08-23 15:10:57 Most people in South India use coconut oil for cooking, hair oil, etc.
5303 2018-08-23 15:10:56 Olive oil is the best
5304 2018-08-23 15:10:51 You replaced your ex after 3000 thousand miles/since your last oil change???
5305 2018-08-23 15:10:37 @RachelNotley How about saving Alberta some $. Stop running those insulting Trans Mountain TV ads. People in BC are educated and know expansion = MORE oil. Alternative facts B.S.! Maybe its aimed at your Alta base? #abpoli #bcpoli @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau #climatechange #cdnpoli
5306 2018-08-23 15:10:25 Good stuff! I use grass fed butter and coconut oil in mine! Only intermittent fast 3 days a week. Throw in some exogenous ketones into the mix. Great for mental clarity!
5307 2018-08-23 15:10:15 Hi I washed my hair and cooked noodles for lunch. I’m at work my son just dropped me off. Fish is so healthy has omega oil and protein. Hoping you are well too @garysnowpatrol
5308 2018-08-23 15:10:13 Dude the heart disease part pretty spot on. India is number one followed by the Philippines in second. Don't use it as a staple. Just like using too must olive oil.
5309 2018-08-23 15:10:11 I only use olive oil.
5310 2018-08-23 15:10:10 When the American Press reports on food, you can assume it’s ‘bobbins’ for a population that eats mainly flour, corn oil, sugar and meat. Given how hard it is to find a reasonable newspaper in the US, one wonders how much most Americans know about world realities.
5311 2018-08-23 15:10:06 So the fact that the amount of money to be made drilling for oil is not a function of capitalism?

5314 2018-08-23 15:09:58 Since when does trump actually give a crap about anyone who isn't a white American (except for his mail order brides).  Sounds like there's oil, gold or something else that he thinks he can take from them by coming in to "protect" them.
5315 2018-08-23 15:09:46 Idk about y’all but my car tells me ahead of time when I’m due for an oil change lol
5316 2018-08-23 15:09:36 @troytrentham this is interesting.. what correlation if any do see with E&P’s vs oil
5317 2018-08-23 15:09:29 The barrels will be stored somewhere at the Coast to reach the exportation threshold. Then the oil will be taken abroad for refining. From there, I dunno-oo.
5318 2018-08-23 15:09:28 Help to fill a container! Oil is what you need.  #gameinsight #ipadgames #ipad
5319 2018-08-23 15:09:20 I used castor oil, not the Jamaican kind. You have to drink. It’s disgusting but it works! She has to be low too.
5320 2018-08-23 15:09:16 Olive oil
5321 2018-08-23 15:09:15 They have found oil  - but even better they manage just fine without it.

5324 2018-08-23 15:08:31 Feeling a bit like yesterday as S&P 2863 +/-3 seems to be range so far. FANG fades lookout. Headline/bs watch. Barring incident meanders here. Even oil flat. Metals/Miners on again off again clearly in Off mode. Banks & Pharma no love today. Eye for rotate in but seems not yet.
5325 2018-08-23 15:08:31 Replacing the DG of the OPCW doesn’t change the fact that the primary role of the OPCW is to write fraudulent reports - so the US can justify attacking a sovereign country - so it can STEAL its OIL.
5326 2018-08-23 15:08:29 The irony is, the @Harvard prof who claimed #Coconut Oil is poison, will die without even consuming it. Sooner or later.
5327 2018-08-23 15:08:23 Coconut oil is nasty shit, basically lard, everything else besides coconut water is fine.
5328 2018-08-23 15:08:18 The whole in the middle is to maximize the surface area exposed to oil, so that it fried and cooked evenly. Warna kachchi daal se pet dukhega
5329 2018-08-23 15:08:16 これは各々一番描きたくてでも一番ハードル高いのぶち当たってない…？神からの試練か…？

5332 2018-08-23 15:07:59 Oil PSUs mining personal data of staff at petrol pumps is a progressive step as after its completion workers would get benefits of certification & enrollment in insurance schemes. This may provide even more secured future to the workers & their families if included with #DBT.
5333 2018-08-23 15:07:44 I just leaked some oil
5334 2018-08-23 15:07:40 Lot lot less as compared to drilling oil out, going on a war and then transporting it to your nearest gas station. A lot less dude!!
5335 2018-08-23 15:07:37 Says a pathetic weasel of a man representing a government that has depended on Scotland's oil for 40 odd years.
5336 2018-08-23 15:07:25 Don't mean to intercede, but coconut oil is completely ok. (Actually great!)Whoever "they" are, are incorrect and not on board with current science. @DZederman does use coconut oil (fairly sure from memory) - but I'll let him confirm. (I use it daily -been keto for a few years.)
5337 2018-08-23 15:07:12 Business has been telling that to the Brexit pushing, Snake Oil Salesmen of the Terminological Inexactitude branches of the Tory and Labour parties. But those are either all blind, deaf and illiterate, or just plain obstinately enthused with enlightened self interest.
5338 2018-08-23 15:07:09 I really think I need to get an essential oil diffuser
5339 2018-08-23 15:07:03 Putain que c'est moche un sharpei. Faut vraiment que les hommes arrêtent de trafiquer les chiens.
5340 2018-08-23 15:07:02 if you come for coconut oil, you’re basically coming for my branding
5341 2018-08-23 15:06:59 Yes...but there must be a way to identify these tunnels using seismic equipment, taking periodic measurements...below ground surveillance of some sort....like X-rays...Oil & Gas even earthquake analysis to identify changes under ground, don’t you think?
5342 2018-08-23 15:06:59 Yes, MaAm' when i step off onto the ground, it feel's like im makeing a 2' lava oil embression,&. Ive seen the documentary, about the cooling cycle of earth. On places where men are yet, willing to travel!

5345 2018-08-23 15:06:39 if the trending news on this platform is about how coconut oil is poison how can you NOt think they are trying to distract us from all the fucKed up shit that’s going down gahhH
5346 2018-08-23 15:06:32 coconut oil is Thousand of years tradition in India and some other countries. It is good for health. 
we are healthy, consuming from ages. if it is not, You should research another in other any planet
5347 2018-08-23 15:06:30 Not to brag, but you could fry a fish in the amount of coconut oil I put in my hair.

5359 2018-08-23 15:05:04 They make at least money with selling Oil they bought from IS.. Oil trucking and gas pipelines.. and I mentioned weapons?   Yes they get the oil from Iran (and trafficking it out to circumvent sanctions).. 
Some have oil the other have weapons, some have both, so they can barter

5366 2018-08-23 15:04:37 is curious for sure. I am dissapointed with today, it's following the usual pattern in this phase but  I thought maybe aaog would be slightly different to high risk exploration stocks as imo this is not a high risk, it's as close to certain as can be, as we know the oil is there
5367 2018-08-23 15:04:26 South Asians have a very high risk for cardiovascular disease. I don’t think its fair to call coconut oil poison but it may be contributing to the risk of CVD is South Asians.

5372 2018-08-23 15:03:47 According to a Harvard professor, coconut oil is “pure poison”. Does that mean I’m gonna stop using it? Of course not. In fact, let me go get some more because I’m running low...#TeamNaturalHair #TheStruggleIsReal
5373 2018-08-23 15:03:45 What’s some oil drops to put in my hair for hair growth?

5380 2018-08-23 15:03:09 @treatibles I picked up some of your oil the other day at our local organic dog food store the photo cannabinoid rich oil drop her that you want to 250 mg per bttl I was just curious if you could tell me the amount of either Indica or sativa that is in the oil thank you
5381 2018-08-23 15:03:08 A year from now, they’ll claim coconut oil increases your life expectancy by 5yrs
5382 2018-08-23 15:03:03 The 30+ companies that pay to be “official” NFL sponsors include Castrol (motor oil), Bridgestone (tires), Anheuser-Busch InBev (beer), USAA (military insurance), Ford (trucks) — and now Pizza Hut.

5389 2018-08-23 15:02:35 I should have added that probably any oil works - I used sweet almond oil, so I think you could use anything you have around! Cooking oil, olive oil, whatever. :)
5390 2018-08-23 15:02:33 Well, thats true. But south asians are at the highest risk for cardiovascular disease. This Harvard professor is being extreme but there maybe some truth to what she is saying, just not on the level she is trying to say its on. I use coconut oil a lot!
5391 2018-08-23 15:02:31 Me: I’m too broke for an oil change!

5394 2018-08-23 15:02:05 Novice Russki bot? You get no rubles for this one, comrade. In America, we put “oil” in the engine, “gas” fuels the car. Also, we spell it “fueled”; not “fuelled”. Plus heirloom tomatoes, organic. We leave the bug spray for you to inhale when you run out of vodka.   
5395 2018-08-23 15:02:01 My grand mother died at the age of 110 ,she used this poison as a cooking oil for all her life ,my neighbor father ,mother.

Coconut oil brought in the harward lab may not be a coconut oil i guess
5396 2018-08-23 15:02:01 They is still now freedom in this World,Whites and Blacks are just like Water and Oil
5397 2018-08-23 15:01:59 That Haravard Professor’s speech about how Coconut Oil is pure poison (when proven to be the exact opposite) proves Benny Leonardo’s quote that Harvard is a place of decline.
5398 2018-08-23 15:01:55 I played the raw audio of his Denver7 interview and said he was guilty as hell. I talked about the case after we found out he stuffed his daughters' bodies in the oil tank.

5400 2018-08-23 15:01:35 Come tell that in Kerala and people will laugh at it. We keralite don't make anything without coconut oil, we should have long vanished from the face of Earth.

5405 2018-08-23 15:01:25 Luke Combs reminds me of someone that you run into the motor oil section of Wal-Mart and have a 20 min convo with who has the best steak in town.

5413 2018-08-23 15:00:54 Is it why we are paying more for oil subsidy? Is it also why the administration has borrowed so much?
5414 2018-08-23 15:00:54 I’m at a Toyota dealership trying to change oil. There’s complimentary doughnut and drinks for customers. I’m thinking of going for my 4th round. 
5415 2018-08-23 15:00:52 true, we in Kerala is using only pure Coconut oil for centuries and were healthy, even now

5424 2018-08-23 15:00:24 Look at Kerala which consumes huge amount of coconut oil it's about 74.9 highest in India.
5425 2018-08-23 15:00:23 It’s a dollars and cents thing. 45k miles a year, no oil changes, no replacing tires, trade every year for $4800.

No that’s not right.

Now twitter?  Thats’s pure p…
5428 2018-08-23 15:00:20 Did the USA grab oil in Iraq?
5429 2018-08-23 15:00:20 I just learned that using baby oil and a sewing needle (or a safety pin that's been opened all the way up) helps the untangling process a LOT! I had basically given up on one of my necklaces ever being untangled but it worked.
5430 2018-08-23 15:00:11 Socialism is just a fork in the road to communism or fascism. America is crushing it with oil which is crushing Russian economy. America crushing it with EU + NATO which was building an oil pipeline to Russia. Question Authority. Reject Big Brother. #WalkAway + FEEL FREEEEEEE
5431 2018-08-23 15:00:09 Coconut oil is used in Jamaica, where quite a few people live very long lives. How is it a poison?
5432 2018-08-23 15:00:04 Clearly coconut oil is important to Malayalees as the sudden flare up of my tweet demonstrates.

And Gujarati folk giving free ka “what to do with your oil-laden head” gyan and getting rebuked by fellow Gujarati person is the entertainment section of the replies. 

Good times.

5436 2018-08-23 14:59:38 Fats that are solid at room temperature are generally bad. Why? Because they will solidify and clog your arteries hence "saturated".  Over consuming anything is generally bad, the Indian diet is more than just coconut oil.

5448 2018-08-23 14:58:42 If coconut oil is possion then most of kerala people must have heart diseases, because they only use coconut oil for cooking.  From 1000 of year coconut oil is been used. I am not agreeing with this research.

5479 2018-08-23 14:56:01 Health food friend, something to think about. Do you have counter research?

Coconut oil is 'pure poison,' Harvard professor says in talk on nutrition - USA TODAYhttps://apple.news/AmGA_Q9JZRLqQk-FPIpT-sQ
5480 2018-08-23 14:56:00 i hate waiting for oil changes to be done 
5481 2018-08-23 14:55:46 NK細胞さんが実は巨乳だってことに気づいて以前から思ってたけどタンクトップの空いてる所から手突っ込んで揉みたい欲がやばくなってきた(ヤバいのはお前だよ)
5482 2018-08-23 14:55:46 you right. it’s the only one w/ fish oil I could think off the top of my head 
5483 2018-08-23 14:55:44 He must front for big pharma that makes heart meds! We're on to these greedy SOBs. People are curing themselves w/ natural remedies like coconut oil& they're getting cut out. Internet is full of people curing cancer, Alzheimer's, skin conditions, stomach problems. WWG1WGA!
5484 2018-08-23 14:55:43 M&S is committed to using only the most sustainable sources of palm oil in our products. We have removed it wherever possible and 100% of the palm oil used in M&S products is RSPO certified. Thanks - Donna.
5485 2018-08-23 14:55:41 We use coconut oil in literally everything. Coconut oil is really good for your hair. Coconut oil is good for your skin. You can cook food in it etc.
5486 2018-08-23 14:55:33 10월에 역대급 한파;; 작년 여름에도 겁나 더워서 겨울에 영하 18도까지 내려갔었는데 올해는 여름에 40도 였으니 겨울엔 영하 20도 찍냐?
5487 2018-08-23 14:55:27 maybe it's the beauty product snake oil snake
5488 2018-08-23 14:55:26 I need 6 coconuts to make coconut oil... people help, Soweto doesn't have shit like coconuts
5489 2018-08-23 14:55:20 The oil check cradle?
5490 2018-08-23 14:55:11 ขอบคุณค่ะ กรี๊ดหนักมากได้คุยกับนักเขียนในดวงใจ 
5491 2018-08-23 14:55:03 Is he a front for a pharmaceutical that makes heart meds? We're on to these greedy SOBs. People are curing themselves w/ natural remedies like coconut oil& they're getting cut out. Internet is full of people curing cancer, Alzheimer's, skin conditions, stomach problems. WWG1WGA!
5492 2018-08-23 14:55:01 A snake oil salesman....
5493 2018-08-23 14:54:47 Thank you! I wanted to paint it with the taxture of oil painting like the MV. And I'm happy to express that! (〃ﾟ3ﾟ〃)
5494 2018-08-23 14:54:46 I don’t think the concept of SPFs have reached the people of Europe yet. They really do love a tanning oil! #europeanholidays fruit for thoughts.
5495 2018-08-23 14:54:43 Uh...scientific evidence, please.

Control for placebo effect, please.

I am pro-decriminalization, but slapping a "sexy" marketing angle on CBD and its related compounds is just...well, snake oil sales.
5496 2018-08-23 14:54:34 クソ夢女だから4989番くんに抱きしめられたい……はあ……
5497 2018-08-23 14:54:31 Anger Chimp still desperately tweeting about pipelines while BC burns. Alberta doesn't need an oil company employee running the province.
5498 2018-08-23 14:54:30 It actually healed a cyst in my eye in the last week. Use on cuts, hair, cooking, as eye makeup remover. It’s wonderful but i use pure oil...it isn’t coconut oil if any other ingredient involved
5499 2018-08-23 14:54:29 someone: *mentions CBD oil*

*10,000 CBD lab Twitters descend upon the tweet and smash fave*
5500 2018-08-23 14:54:29 Markets tanked yday on the news of Cohen and Manafort. Oil dropped when trump said gas prices high , Canadian $ down , Turkish lira fell , South African rand fell yday on his tweet. Any more evidence . Your 401k is safe till trump is president 2024. After that sell sell sell.
5501 2018-08-23 14:54:22 Avocado oil can be used for roasting and grilling root vegetables such as sweet potatoes, carrots and turnips. It can also be used in salad dressings, marinades, soups, stir-fries, baked goods, sauces, smoothies, pesto, pizza, and kale chips. Can also be drizzled on anything.
5502 2018-08-23 14:54:20 No heat let it air dry oil it and wrap your hair in a towel
5503 2018-08-23 14:54:17 I’m trying to finesse the essential oil cult.
5504 2018-08-23 14:54:12 We went through all this before:I remember when theatres were using coconut oil for popcorn,  and suddenly there was a huge reversal based on someone's research... but slowly coconut oil has been coming back.  My son, a vegan swears by the stuff...
5505 2018-08-23 14:54:04 Only place I’ll put coconut oil is on my scalp. That shit too thick.
5506 2018-08-23 14:54:03 PSA: IF YOUR CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS ON THAT MEANS YOU ALREADY FUCKED SOMETHING UP. 

Make sure you check your oil, coolant, and other fluids periodically so you don’t find out that you needed oil in your car when you’ve already blown a hole in your engine.
5507 2018-08-23 14:54:01 I like that it's the color of cannabis oil

5511 2018-08-23 14:53:48 My view is that (a) MacLean didn’t supply the evidence, but also (b) she’s almost certainly right about not just the function but also the purpose of public choice theory. Which is why its proponents feel the need to pour boiling oil & boulders down the side of the castle at her.
5512 2018-08-23 14:53:46 i’ve bleached a lot and the roots stay fine just make sure to take care of the bleached part i usually do a hair mask once a week and keep my hair in coconut oil for hours like every two weeks that should keep ur hair feeling almost normal
5513 2018-08-23 14:53:43 We have oil & we keep shipping it away instead of refining it here. Much like our raw lumber...
5514 2018-08-23 14:53:41 Hell yea. Oil money. Respect, man.
5515 2018-08-23 14:53:39 Hindi pala gawa sa chicken ung chicken oil 
5516 2018-08-23 14:53:33 All because they were going to stop selling oil in US dollars.
5517 2018-08-23 14:53:27 I am waiting for the Bollywood movie: "Coconut Oil Madness" where people consume the oil and go crazy. Much ado about NOTHING. Just a thing where experts take a food that is at best neither good nor bad, and alternately demonize and canonize it for their own purposes.
5518 2018-08-23 14:53:27 Thailand
 Electronic machines, automobile are main export products.
 In addition, rice and natural rubber are high.

Malaysia
 You should consider this country as industrialised country just like Thailand.
 Natural gases and Palm oil are also prosperous.
5519 2018-08-23 14:53:27 Is the "olive oil" version of Pam the same price? Asking for a friend.
5520 2018-08-23 14:53:25 Don’t watch Fox News but did they cover the sad, sad, sad story of that man in Colorado who killed his pregnant wife & his 2 little girls.  His daughters were 3 & 4 yrs. old and he stuffed their little bodies in oil tanks.  Horrible monster.  Evil comes in all colors.
@MSNBC
5521 2018-08-23 14:53:23 I’m not sure if the correct way to frame the answer is money and oil or oil and money pick whichever looks the most accurate.
5522 2018-08-23 14:53:17 Oil prices vary across the province too. When we went to PEI and NS it appeared as if prices were unilateral across the provinces unlike here.
5523 2018-08-23 14:53:02 そうじゃないが
5524 2018-08-23 14:52:59 Wet the first time, damping now(or I can’t control it, and it starts to dread), then soaking it.

If I were home I’d mist with argan oil when slightly wet.
5525 2018-08-23 14:52:57 Yeah but did your grandparents get paid by the olive oil industry...
5526 2018-08-23 14:52:56 he suppose to be doing my oil change today  that hoe ain’t answer ...

what up, body?
5528 2018-08-23 14:52:45 @realDonaldTrump what about the genocide against muslims by the US for oil? Let's look at that as well.
5529 2018-08-23 14:52:39 I lost my health as I stayed away from coconut oil, gingerly oil and ghee when I turned 30. I regained my health as I shunned refined oil and other stuff marketed by the Americans and reverted back to what my grandparents consumed.

5538 2018-08-23 14:51:48 Emmm. Baiklah roy oil and gas.
5539 2018-08-23 14:51:48 Cop 1: She was found dead outside a health food store. We think she was poisoned. 
Cop 2: Health food store? Have the coroner run a blood panel for coconut oil. That stuff is pure poison.

5552 2018-08-23 14:50:30 Years of poor policy and appropriation of any successful business including PDVSA and replacing knowledge with stupid minions has led to a destruction of the oil industry. Refineries are falling apart and tankers leak all the way to destination. Govt failure not CIA or capitalism
5553 2018-08-23 14:50:30 I’m just here to let all of y’all know that your car won’t tell you when you need more coolant or oil, etc. when it’s low. You have to check these things every so often to keep your car in good condition. It’s better to catch it before you’re sitting on the side of the road.
5554 2018-08-23 14:50:29 Mと罵って欲しいのは違わないけど違うんだよ

@BillClinton and they impeached him. 
Sell your snake oil elsewhere. We're all stocked up here.
5559 2018-08-23 14:49:59 This didn’t surprise me! Use extra virgin olive oil, it’s a pure fruit juice.
5560 2018-08-23 14:49:32 He’s probably busy icing down the snake oil Trump sold him. Hahah
5561 2018-08-23 14:49:31 No buts, no cuts, no coconuts. Unless it's the oil. Not the water. That shit is nasty.

5565 2018-08-23 14:49:17 It has already been planned. USA will be #1 with oil export, the market is going to go into recession by 2024, there will b a depression in the US. Almost a crash. Maybe instead of killing our Youth, why don't we teach them how 2 invest in the market, how to build & own their own
5566 2018-08-23 14:49:17 My birthday's in a few weeks. Can everybody buy me as much coconut oil as possible?

5568 2018-08-23 14:49:15 Quandary:  Toy dinosaurs are made from plastic. Plastic is made from oil.  Oil comes from fossils.  Fossils are the bones of dead dinosaurs.  

Therefore:  Toy dinosaurs are made from dead dinosaurs.
5569 2018-08-23 14:49:13 They might have found that coconut oil exports are increasing.
5570 2018-08-23 14:49:11 will be preparing my own meals na. it's been years since i had troubles w my skin this extreme! blaming the amount of vegetable oil from my 2-week meals :(
5571 2018-08-23 14:49:10 Why do you put it in? Why do you think it’s needed? I don’t know a single person who puts it in a pie - any pie! So why do you? Palm oil is a choice. Why does Tesco choose tonsupport this industry?
5572 2018-08-23 14:49:10 It really is shocking how a carbon tax in Canada is causing oil and gas prices to rise around the world. You are a disingenuous blowhard.
5573 2018-08-23 14:49:07 MCT Oil 
5574 2018-08-23 14:49:07 And by the way, where does this oil go after Turkana? What happens to it?
@OndiekiMogere please enlighten me!
5575 2018-08-23 14:48:53 And regarding oil, the incompetente of a leader who still publishes a budget based on $100 a barrel oil is another reason the economy worsens. The natural resources some of which are very rare and the oil means they should be second richest country in the World.
5576 2018-08-23 14:48:51 そうやって
5577 2018-08-23 14:48:45 I’ve been waiting for an oil change for an hour and a half I feel like? It doesnt take this long?
5578 2018-08-23 14:48:45 He must want to open the Asian market to heart medication! The people of Thailand have a lot of coconut oil, know what else they don't have - heart disease. A doctor in Florida cured her husband's Alzheimer's with coconut oil. Greedy phuckers want the whole world popping pills.
5579 2018-08-23 14:48:43 Pure Poison is anything containing #splenda #saccharine #sweetnlow #asparteme #nutrasweet or any other concocted fake sweeteners to kill us all of slowly .. Nobody is drinking coconut oil but i tell you that Tampico drink with vegetable oil in is delicious when ice cold 
5580 2018-08-23 14:48:37 so like a year ago or something i was watching random 'How To Meal Prep' videos on youtube... there was this couple that basically used coconut oil for every dish and this was supposed to be healthy food... it's not something that we have/use here coconut oil

5587 2018-08-23 14:47:55 @CNBC not producing our own steel is a security issue as with not producing our own oil. Steel and oil is the real currency of current civilization.  If you don’t produce it yourself you are at the mercy of your “friends” and enemies.

5591 2018-08-23 14:47:40 According to a Harvard professor, coconut oil is “pure poison”. Does that mean I’m gonna stop using it? Of course not. In fact, let me go get some more bc I’m running low
5592 2018-08-23 14:47:38 Yes!!! Heaven forbid I try to help the environment and get off Big Oil. 
5593 2018-08-23 14:47:36 Venezuela was giving oil to Cuba, China and Russia under Chavez. He fired the people capable of running the oil industry and put cronies in their place. These people had no idea of how extraction etc worked. THAT is part of the problem.

5596 2018-08-23 14:47:29 Very good point @Dexterdawson200! @fezziwig2008 so you are saying cb4211 will show efficacy or not. I see your point about olive oil.. But you understand the logic is that you are saying cb4211 is efficacious by linking it with same. MOA as olive oil? U get that?
5597 2018-08-23 14:47:25 @harvard pice of PR pigwash and research funded by Food Mafia. Many studies of Harvard itself prove Coco oil is Super Food and Super Medicine.

5602 2018-08-23 14:47:13 For every "expert" and study, I can find another expert and study that proves the opposite.   Coconut oil is not poison.
5603 2018-08-23 14:47:11 Reuters- #Singapore #fuel oil inventories hit over 9-year low to 2.12 million tonnes this week on lean imports. Purchases from #Venezuela declined to 40,820 tonnes this week vs 98,374 tonnes the previous week - Singapore's IE #OOTT

5612 2018-08-23 14:46:30 Not sure if you are saying we should stop protesting against oil exploration, production and transmission and simply work on those that burn oil. In point of fact we did have a negotiated agreement with major CO2 polluters called the Paris Agreement that the president canceled
5613 2018-08-23 14:46:30 In India specially in coastal Karnataka and Kerala we use coconut oil ghee and coconut for every thing we cook for thousands of years and in this part you will not find any decease you are saying and heart problems. I think study is motivated or not authentic

5619 2018-08-23 14:46:12 Coconut Oil is pure poison, ok
5620 2018-08-23 14:46:09 Coconut oil perfectly healthy. I cook exclusively with it.

Eggs are fine too. Eat the whole thing, the yolk is where all the nutrition is.

5624 2018-08-23 14:45:45 Why do we support "a repulsive & tyrannical regime"? Well, it's kinda our thing; we've been doing it for a while. Also, for this particular regime, one word--oil. Jimmy Carter was the only POTUS to try to break our history of support of tyrants. We should try again!

5634 2018-08-23 14:45:09 Didn't know coconut oil was Indian invention. 
Also many health orgs says coconut oil contains high saturated fats.
So all's against us?

5648 2018-08-23 14:44:10 I mean I don’t think it’s a miracle oil that came from heaven but this is a bit extreme.
5649 2018-08-23 14:44:10 I wish business news would stop trying to explain why the stock market or oil or bitcoin was up or down yesterday. I fundamentally believe that  absent an external event  shock the answer is actually unknowable. #fakenews #business

5651 2018-08-23 14:44:01 Paid research sponsored by multinationals to push their products. We Indians from the state of Kerala, have been using coconut oil for ages and there is dearth of old people still living hale and hearty. People have become wise to fall to these phony research.

5668 2018-08-23 14:42:21 Weld County gets lots of revenue from oil and gas. Boulder County does not. Choices. You ignore the difference between payroll taxes (employee’s portion of social security) and income tax, which most minimum wage workers do not pay.

5676 2018-08-23 14:41:54 Ironic that the Outdoor Retailers show moved to CO from Utah when it is just as environmentally unfriendly, but the politicians don't openly come out & say they're against public lands. Instead they just quietly take oil & gas payoffs.
5677 2018-08-23 14:41:52 Isn't it a lil crazy that nobody mentions the colorado man who murdered his pregnant wife and 2 kids and dumped their bodies in the crude oil wells on his own job site. Doesn't fit the crazy racist narrative, why because he is a white American man...

5697 2018-08-23 14:40:16 I would try a lite olive oil, like a salad oil, as it will have a neutral more flavor-less taste. But personally I love full flavored olive oil for everything, jus regular cold pressed EVOO.

5703 2018-08-23 14:40:02 Yes we have policy options, but we don’t have political support. We have Individual #1 out there trying to use more coal. We have huge corporations with oil reserves on their balance sheet and they will do everything they can to turn those into profits.

5709 2018-08-23 14:39:50 @iansample Kerala is the only Indian state which has been cooking with coconut oil every day since many years. And they swear by its health benefits. It's used as a hair oil and is anti-bacterial meaning used for cuts and bruises. It reduces wrinkles, especially crow's feet.

5718 2018-08-23 14:38:50 It isnt that's the point...but they do rely on oil. And if SA floods the market, they could take out Russia without going to war with Russia.
5719 2018-08-23 14:38:48 A better comparison would be comparing St. John's prices to the rest of NL or other provinces. NS and PEI have much lower prices than us and make no money on offshore oil like us. How is this happening, and how can we prevent it from getting worse?
5720 2018-08-23 14:38:44 What nonsense, using it for many years also. The Extra Vierge kind coming in glass, not plastic, with the coconut smell and taste still on and in it, is the best there is when it comes to organic oil. Very beneficial indeed, it improved my health, so agree 100% with you Kabir

5726 2018-08-23 14:38:33 I don’t believe for one second that coconut oil is “poison” it’s no more poison than the chemtrails they spray thru the California sky
5727 2018-08-23 14:38:33 Harvard studies are complete waste, these days. 
According to this poison, half of India should die every year as every second person use Coco oil. We r 1.3 billion, may be one of their researcher could explain why still population is not reducing :P

5730 2018-08-23 14:38:15 So long as the Head Choppers keep buying their weapons and selling them cheap oil. Saudi will keep doing what they like. It just shows what a joke the UN is, allowing them to have a seat on the Human Rights Commission.
5731 2018-08-23 14:38:11 How about the UK Government just admitted that what was sold to the British public, by a bunch of charlatans, as how Brexit would turn out was just so much snake oil, can never be delivered and we should just call the whole thing off?

5734 2018-08-23 14:37:53 Have been meaning to try avocado oil. Is it a multi use oil or more suited to dressings and gently heated recipes? I make a lot of pesto and often change the herb or nuts but never thought to try a different oil. Also what’s nutritional yeast?

5750 2018-08-23 14:36:34 I believe hundreds of millions of people using this oil for years have greater credibility than one Harvard prof. First look for money links for the prof. May be into selling corn oil, soy, peanut, vegetable,etc. Harvard may have a nut on the payroll, snubery .

5752 2018-08-23 14:36:28 It may not be incorrect. Coconut oil is enriched with saturated fats which is bad for health.

5754 2018-08-23 14:36:16 I like to rub peppermint oil on my scrotum and anus. I find it really gets me moving.

5756 2018-08-23 14:36:11 Well said, must be sponsored by olive oil guys,,
5757 2018-08-23 14:36:09 OIL SPILLS, FRACKING SPILLS, TARSAND SPILLS, COAL SPILLS, Devastatting Our Environment Over & Over Again!
5758 2018-08-23 14:35:51 Yes. And like in the Indian temple, the Garbhagriha is lit only using oil lamps.
5759 2018-08-23 14:35:37 The study is flawed. Maybe they have not taken into account that coconut oil is used in cooking along with spices. Which would change the molecular characteristics of coconut oil.

5761 2018-08-23 14:35:27 My mom use to take oil stains and blood stains with it.
5762 2018-08-23 14:35:25 I am horrified that a doctor is advising on oil related strategy to start with..
5763 2018-08-23 14:35:17 Y’all still debating coconut oil?
5764 2018-08-23 14:35:07 This wild growth oil is so loud.
5765 2018-08-23 14:35:02 Taiwan
 It is substantial independent country unlike Hongkong.
 Electronic industrial products

Philippines
 Not only machines but also banana and coconut oil are high.

Vietnam
 Light industry such as clothes is major, however, the export volume of crude oil has increased.
5766 2018-08-23 14:35:02 I be going to get a simple oil change and come out with a whole bunch of shit done to my car , like oil filter change , tire rotation.....a bunch of bull shit 
5767 2018-08-23 14:34:57 Nr 1 he wasn`t undocumented, and what about that white guy who strangled his wife and children and put them in oil tankers?  Your hypocrisy is mind blowing

5772 2018-08-23 14:34:34 I have 2 ask (Mexican here) why olive oil at low 2 medium heat? I cook w/ olive oil mostly, but 4  shells & tostadas I mix some vegetable oil or oil b/c they cook better at high heat & there’s no funny after tastealso b/c I hate the smoke it makes
5773 2018-08-23 14:34:26 Peppermint. Soak a cotton ball with peppermint oil and place them where the ants are and it will drive them away.. it’s also good for other creepy crawlers. I mix a little essential oil with water for a simple mosquito/tick repellant 
5774 2018-08-23 14:34:25 Topped off my oil today and filled up the tank with 93.... feeling accomplished
5775 2018-08-23 14:34:01 I’m terrible about maintenance. I haven’t even cleaned mine in years haha. If I know I’m putting it in storage I’ll typically oil it, but idk if it’s completely necessary to take it in before using. My experience indicates it’ll be fine but if you really want to be safe...do it?
5776 2018-08-23 14:33:42 My boyfriends ex texted him saying she found a tiny bottle of oil that went to pair of his clippers in her apartment and ask him if he wanted it. They’d been apart for almost a year and 1/2 at this point and she lives like 3 hours away lol
5777 2018-08-23 14:33:40 Can't even bother to do research and just retweeting a lede and some story with biased framing. Always have to use the same old stupid wording like "Big Oil" or "Big Pharma." It's like some stinky OWS drum circle.
5778 2018-08-23 14:33:37 Just like him...could be his brother.

5783 2018-08-23 14:33:24 In most of South India and in few other places in India people use only coconut oil for cooking for not few years but centuries!! @Harvard needs a research on its own professors where and how they got their teaching degrees!!
5784 2018-08-23 14:33:22 If Assad is taken out, they install a puppet, and allow the creation of said pipeline, and flood the market with oil destroying Russias economy and making it easier to take them out. That is why they took a stand in Syria.
5785 2018-08-23 14:33:17 Have big oil pay the 12 billion
5786 2018-08-23 14:33:02 Nothing says betrayal quite like when you see a car tailing you on the highway and you notice it’s the same model as your car...
Come on, fellow Cruze owner, you know this beast doesn’t have any punch and I’m 6,000 miles late for an oil change

5790 2018-08-23 14:32:42 Probably true but the only thing he ever tweets about is his employers at the oil companies.
5791 2018-08-23 14:32:26 Remember the time you were driving with no oil 
5792 2018-08-23 14:32:22 Please, you're not fooling anyone. Had a Dem hired this guy? You'd be rushing to pick up a tiki torch. BTW what about the sick F put his kids & wife in oil drums? US citizens commit crime at a much higher rate than immigrants but that doesn't fit narrative does it? Bigot.
5793 2018-08-23 14:32:21 Could be mud / kill fluid / something that needs treating but not hazardous. 
Oil tankers should be along soon enough.
5794 2018-08-23 14:32:19 Should be the other way around, shouldn’t it? Taxpayers should ask the oil industry to protect them from climate change.

5796 2018-08-23 14:32:09 Bolton on Iranian forces in Syria: "Our objective is that all Iranian forces return to Iran"

5802 2018-08-23 14:31:29 There is nothing wrong with Russia Today unless you follow liberal news which tells you Russia is our enemy. You do understand there is a war for oil right? And Syria was the last location left to take out to create the pipeline from Saudi to Europe. This is why Putin stepped in

Coconut oil is 'pure poison'?

His aim is only to malign India's culture.
Coconut oil is world famous oil.

5840 2018-08-23 14:28:34 Attacking Germany's oil deal doesn't stop it. It just adds to the cracks within NATO. Previous zany attacks by Trump against NATO itself had the effect to undermine its stature, to get the allies to scratch their heads,  and bolster Putin's power in Europe.

5842 2018-08-23 14:28:11 Absolutely ridiculous & fake
Almost everyone in India use coconut oil on their hairs from generations
People in west coast & southern part of India r using it for all cooking items, apply & massage it on skins
These people have lived more than average with less skin diseases

They wont tell you what they mixed with the coconut oil
5885 2018-08-23 14:22:47 The Harvard professor needs to study the science on high fat low carb diets. Maybe if you try to eat a low fat high carb diet and use coconut oil it’s true but if you live as a fat burner rather than a sugar burner then the science proves that saturated fat brings health not harm
5886 2018-08-23 14:22:21 CNRL makes our entire industry look bad when they “think outside the box” (break the rules). I’m not a shill for the oil industry, I care about the ppl who work in it. And perhaps we need to out bad actors if we’re to honestly go to the public and solicit their support.

5890 2018-08-23 14:21:47 So i was reading the other day about mango oil, and mango butter and  how its made from the seeds in the husk of mango. Do you do anything with your byproduct?
5891 2018-08-23 14:21:47 Watch the mayo. Made with soybean oil. Very bad! Make my own from avocado oil. Takes 30 seconds. Crack one egg in a 2 cup measuring cup, add 2 teaspoons of Dijon mustard and 3 teaspoons lemon juice, add 175ml of avocado oil. Put immersion blender in. Done 30 seconds later.
5892 2018-08-23 14:21:45 @WhiteHouse I have discovered Texas is purchasing more oil than delivering.  I suggest buying it up.
5893 2018-08-23 14:21:44 Hardly press stopping news....did you think they would just put out the fire and forget about it? It's a fire in a oil refinery!!
5894 2018-08-23 14:21:31 Kak jadi hoax kan nih??? asli gue nangis sih kalo coconut oil ternyata beneran ga sehat. Been using it for months. Suka rasanya dan enak di kantong juga 
5895 2018-08-23 14:21:27 This is astounding since Big Oil is one of the reasons we have climate change.
5896 2018-08-23 14:21:24 there is scientific proof too much soy is messing up the manly parts of men-translation-eat meat and vegetables, use olive oil etc
5897 2018-08-23 14:21:15 Got the oil in my car changed the guys at Midas said everything looks good but they said I should get a new battery sometime
5898 2018-08-23 14:20:59 One thing I don’t understand is this? What changed now? Research on coconut oil and saturated fats are there from 2decades back. A sudden urge to introduce a scare and make headlines for a product which is highly in use.. I see it as a business tactic. Nothing else.

5901 2018-08-23 14:20:40 Were you on the recent coconut oil trend?  Well, watch out because  according to the @American_Heart it has 80% saturated fat while butter only has 63% and pork lard only 39%. I guess this healthy trend is not so healthy! #coconutoilisout #wvunews @wvunews

5905 2018-08-23 14:20:15 Yes. Coconut oil is shit. And Canola oil, made from rapeseed and used as a lubricant in diesel engines, is the most healthy edible oil.

5913 2018-08-23 14:19:25 Oil and gas made up a majority of Venezuela's exports and both were nationalized under socialist reforms. So that's socialism.

If the "means of production" behind Venezuela's exports were not privately owned, that isn't capitalism. Nor fascism even. The option left: socialism.

5922 2018-08-23 14:18:37 Keralites and Entire Sri Lankan use coconut oil for cooking. I don’t see any problem in health. Are you trying to do some marketing for moisturizer? Coconut oil is natural moisturizer. When you consume it , you skin will shine naturally.

5936 2018-08-23 14:17:13 Nigeria returned to democracy in 1979 - in an oil boom. Many politicians had independent means of livelihood and there were towering figures like Zik, Awo and Aminu Kano, who people would follow without asking for a kobo. Politics wasn't perfect, but not as bad as it is today.

5940 2018-08-23 14:16:55 Personally prefer it if the oil production is managed to gradually reduce whilst transitioning to renewables. Potentially more income from renewables too as europe’s appetite for power continues to grow.

5956 2018-08-23 14:15:50 Russia's economy is driven by oil exports. Russia would be wealthy had America not increased drilling + become world's largest producer. America's increasing oil production is crushing Russia's economy, like 80's arms race collapsed Soviet Union. Putin definitely pissed off now.

6001 2018-08-23 14:12:19 1. Not a lot of its own making? Nonsense. The took large numbers of private industry into their control - not least oil. The experienced managers left or were replaced with 'good party people' . Leading to a massive fall in productivity. At the same time huge spending projects.

6003 2018-08-23 14:12:16 Start with leveraged REITs.  Then look at loan spreads, which mirror bond spreads in terms of tightness.  All cause by @federalreserve manipulation of the yield curve.  Then oil, real estate.  #OperationTwist
6004 2018-08-23 14:12:16 I guess there was 2 recalls on my car. Thanks for waiting until I came in for an oil change to letting me know...
6005 2018-08-23 14:12:13 At your age you should know a lot better than to swallow the "end of life" swill. After all, you've been through the famine/global cooling/end of oil/population bomb/and other scares, right? I was - what did actually happen?
6006 2018-08-23 14:12:13 Milk? Your product is an alternative to half and half. And I'd love to see how coffee creamer is "churned" even once, let alone three times. Why would anyone put sweetened hydrogenated oil in their coffee? Oh, and stop stealing water, Nestle.
6007 2018-08-23 14:12:12 I didn't know socialism was ownership of just some resources that are unfuckuppable. Even the most idiotic governments know how to make profits off oil. Show me Norway running an industry where competition is challenge.

Hold up, herbs! 
6023 2018-08-23 14:11:16 Ah the love & hate relationship "researchers" have with coconut oil.  
6024 2018-08-23 14:11:16 Eucalyptus trees brought to CA en masse from Australia in the early 1900’s were planted. They take ~100 years to mature, and when they do they produce eucalyptus oil that is flammable at high temperatures. The warming earth + flammable oil from trees = CA on fire.
6025 2018-08-23 14:11:13 Wind is questionable due to outward impacts to moisture/current flows, and batteries require chemicals extracted during the processing of coal/oil, so it seems you dont know much about the technologies, much like your other lies.

6032 2018-08-23 14:10:49 Coconut oil is one of the best oils in the world. South Indians have for centuries used this oil which is quite healthy. I was told in the US there is a good sale of coconut oil & that cud be the reason to bring down the sale.

6042 2018-08-23 14:09:51 Israel is doing the dirty work by killing innocent civilians while the U.S. supplies them with military aid. All of this for land & oil.
6043 2018-08-23 14:09:50 Had to buy some coconut oil. My coconuts were getting way too squeaky.
6044 2018-08-23 14:09:43 Use rosehip oil. Rosehip oil is loaded with vitamins and antioxidants which help to keep skin looking smooth and healthy. Through regular use, marks and scars will fade and become less prominent over time. Simply massage the oil gently into the affected area once or twice a day.
6045 2018-08-23 14:09:35 Using this family is disgusting. You're vile. White American man kills pregnant wife and strangles daughters and sticks them in vats of oil. Got nothing? Dog

6081 2018-08-23 14:06:46 Why are you not complaining about the white man that killed his 2 daughters and put them in oil filled drums and killed his pregnant wife & buried her in shallow grave. Is he allowed to murder 3 people and an unborn child because he is white American. Does he get a free pass here
6082 2018-08-23 14:06:42 Everyone is confused whether tea, coffee, chocolate... now coconut oil is healthy or harmful

6085 2018-08-23 14:06:25 It's when we choose to ignore evil and the fallenness of this world that we are most vulnerable to join in it.  The HELPER never suggests denial, but the enemy certainly does.  Check lamp oil daily and keep them on FULL.
6086 2018-08-23 14:06:14 It's also because lobbying like the American heart association is payed for by the sugar and bread companies. Don't buy their bs about coconut oil. That shit is good.

6088 2018-08-23 14:06:09 Is coconut oil  more  harmful than potassium cyanide?
6089 2018-08-23 14:06:06 you're the boss but.. try putting some olive oil and a slice of garlic, fry it for a minute till it becomes a little brown. Add some kind of sliced onion if you like (and pepper) than add the tomatoes (and sauce), lower the flame and wait! Pasta is ready in 10 min more or less.

6122 2018-08-23 14:03:42 similar campaign was launched somewhere in the late 70s which fizzled out after few years once again started. Maybe the west has used up their stock of coconut oil and want it at a lower cost from Asia

6125 2018-08-23 14:03:33 I'm a big fan of magnesium oil---mega version of espom salts---and walks with the dogs in the woods, and humidifiers with essential oils.  The only place I truly get into balance is at a beach, but I live in middle America.

6129 2018-08-23 14:02:42 Have you tried like coconut oil? Theres one from home that we make completely vegan (though it has a short ish shelf life) that I use on my skin and it doesn't affect my break outs and i have super oily skin...
6130 2018-08-23 14:02:40 Yup. U r on the money. Coconut oil raises HDL but also raises LDL.. it's likely that some firm will patent refined version which will 'clear out' the LDL but will 'retain' the HDL.
Like everything, advisable to use it moderately but it's definitely not 'pure poison'..
6131 2018-08-23 14:02:38 I gotta admit that coconut oil going down hard right now for “being worse than lard” for you is pretty fun.  Some people are not taking it well.

6145 2018-08-23 14:01:41 I used unfractionated coconut oil on some antiques with moving pieces as I was concerned with solvents in industrial products.
True story, it has traction & slip of many industrial products without solvents that may damage old paint or ceramic materials. Metal on metal, not sure.

6153 2018-08-23 14:01:21 Coconut is a low boiling point oil which can't be used for meat based food deep frying. If used then the food will absorb more oil leading to higher oil intake leading to coleastrol issues. It is quantity not quality/type which is an issue

6156 2018-08-23 14:00:50 My favorite is when people put it on their pets or in their food because they think coconut oil is a cure-all. It is not. Get some omegas and a good shampoo. For anything more, talk to your vet.

Only thing I use coconut oil for is baking my dog's cookies.
6157 2018-08-23 14:00:47 the idea of letting oil men into the electric car business...they will vandalize it.

Thank you.
6173 2018-08-23 13:59:45 I mean... not really. I CAN change a tire, check the oil and coolant and pump gas. Most of the time someone else handles all those things for me.
6174 2018-08-23 13:59:44 Next time you should do a research. Oil, 50% taxes? Nah.
6175 2018-08-23 13:59:31 No, demand is not increasing but supply is decreasing. Because Trump decided to screw the Iran Deal, we are no longer getting oil from Iran. Smaller supply = greater price from other suppliers. If Texas was really making greater gains in supply, prices would be lower.
6176 2018-08-23 13:59:24 Shit Bish, I lived through the #PennSquareBank collapse and subsequent oil bust - roll the fucking dice
6177 2018-08-23 13:59:21 自分のツレにやらせろや
6178 2018-08-23 13:58:56 Poor guys...
6179 2018-08-23 13:58:54 That's probably an extremely good choice considering it's all cooked in peanut oil 
6180 2018-08-23 13:58:53 What did I say about drinking to much oil
6181 2018-08-23 13:58:53 it might. Didn't fry them. Actually tossed them with some olive oil, and baked in the over for about 30-40 minutes
6182 2018-08-23 13:58:51 先輩赤血球ちゃんがDかな……？
6183 2018-08-23 13:58:47 How about the pregnant white woman killed by her white husband and her two children stuffed in oil cans.  No mention of that horrendous murder they’re not brown.

6185 2018-08-23 13:58:29 ผมคิดว่าเราคงมีอะไรหลายอย่างให้ติดตามมากกว่ากีฬา เลยดูเหมือนกระแสจะเบาลงทั้งๆที่เวลาก็โอเคอยู่นะครับ นี่ถ้าไปแข่งโอลิมปิกแล้วคนละโซนเวลากันจะยิ่งคนดูน้อยกว่านี้อีกครับ
6186 2018-08-23 13:58:27 見た感じ赤血球ちゃんはそのまま下を向いてもそこまで視界が遮られなさそうなのでC……だと思う……
6187 2018-08-23 13:58:24 Just few days back a research from West is out, wherein it has been inferred that the best medicine to cure the cancer is coconut oil. Now is Harvard Professor is right in making such different claim..Please rethink twice Sir...
6188 2018-08-23 13:58:21 Today on Huff Post Taste, Excellent articles Coconut Oil , fresh dates and Keto Pasta. Check them out @jwu.edu @NRI_Chamber @CranstonPatch @golocalprov
6189 2018-08-23 13:58:16 I mean, that was my first reaction. The pencil I get....
6190 2018-08-23 13:58:11 I can't even get hype about the NFL anymore man. Most of the fan base is made up of racist little league dad coaches and the vibe at Lucas oil stadium is like going to a NASCAR race.
6191 2018-08-23 13:58:07 Hawaiian Silky 14 in 1, Cantu leave in conditioner with Argon Oil, and ORS daily moisturizing hair lotion
6192 2018-08-23 13:58:04 Receiving a promise of oil concessions, the Soviets withdrew from Iran proper in May 1946. The two puppet states were soon overthrown following the Iran crisis of 1946, and the oil concessions were revoked.[153][15
6193 2018-08-23 13:57:59 We also use coconut oil as hair oil, and poison in it keeps lees away.. And anyway, our greats thinkers said famously once, 'power is poison'
6194 2018-08-23 13:57:47 Ahnahn

Just Yam, Goat, Oil, Rice, Semo, Elubo, Cow, Garri, Beer, Soft Drinks, Table, Chair, Hall, MC, DJ, Bride Price..... What else
Not too much oo
6195 2018-08-23 13:57:45 I used to get silk wrap with a gel overlay (I used to bite my nails and this strengthened them up a lot). It looked a bit more “natural” as well. Would recommend. I just stopped cos my nails started growing long & strong by themselves :) Can recommend getting a good cuticle oil!
6196 2018-08-23 13:57:43 Mjolnir?! 
6197 2018-08-23 13:57:40 how is this different than a 3x oil ETF? Prior to 2011, the great majority of the world's production came from OPEC countries, oil trades globally, there is no way to control OPEC, yet there were still incredibly levered ETFs for grandma to play in ...
6198 2018-08-23 13:57:39 Perhaps you are familiar with Catch and Release.  Obama and policies is like oil and water.
6199 2018-08-23 13:57:39 got my oil changed and im on my eay to walmart and the meat store for some groceries
6200 2018-08-23 13:57:29 i finally have an excuse to try painting because I need paint for my art class this semester but I have no clue how to paint or what brand of acrylics to buy (acrylics only because oil is too expensive lol) so HELP ME
6201 2018-08-23 13:57:29 Of course. Please use refined oil.
6202 2018-08-23 13:57:29 This life ...

See these Igbo men and Hausa man conversing in hausa language for this oil and gas business sha.

But my Igbo people keep demonizing the Hausas on social media.

This life is beautiful. Everything seems to be turning apart.
6203 2018-08-23 13:57:25 Uh-Oh! Here we Go! 1st draught of Oily Olly's 84-dose No-Deal Castor Oil showing UK on verge of annihilation... Daleks abound. Think I'll hibernate till all over, leave Remain to indulge its frenzy of fear alone. 
Note SKY still promoting Propaganda Remain with all might & main
6204 2018-08-23 13:57:22 If you take a look at the GERS report you will see the Scottish government has included geographical share of oil revenues.

However it does not stop uk cutting the tax or collecting the tax a different way to disguise it.
6205 2018-08-23 13:57:18 Mate of mine was in the Merchant Navy. Sailing the Indian Ocean one day he was admiring the turtles paddling away, assuming they were smart enough to spot the oncoming oil tanker. He was wrong and said it made and almighty 'crack' on collision.
6206 2018-08-23 13:57:07 cguro maraming pasta sa caserole,kya marmi ding tubig then mlkas ung boiling nya,baka naglagay uli sya ng pasta while boiling kya malapit arm nya,bka ung pagtaas ng tubig tumalsik sa knya,,oil kc kkapit agd sa balat,khit ipagpag,
6207 2018-08-23 13:56:56 We’ll flood the fire in oil!
6208 2018-08-23 13:56:46 เมื่อไหล่จะเดือนหน้าสักที อยากพักผ่อนแล้วว อยากไปเจออะไรก็ได้ที่มันสบายใจ อยากอยู่คนเดียว
6209 2018-08-23 13:56:46 That's why olive oil it's so good
6210 2018-08-23 13:56:38 Yuge hot oil hair treatment, avocado co wash shampoo bar and jungle conditioner bar! 
6211 2018-08-23 13:56:37 Is it rain or olive oil?
6212 2018-08-23 13:56:35 Louis Woodhill: "Reagan immediately decontrolled U.S. oil prices, to unleash the supply side of the U.S. economy.  Even more importantly, Reagan backed Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker’s campaign to strengthen and stabilize the U.S. dollar."
6213 2018-08-23 13:56:31 The pan I have does not need oil but if yours needs some then yes use oil 
6214 2018-08-23 13:56:25 Time for @CoconutBoard to clear the air on coconut oil and tell us all what are the myths and what are the truths. #Karinmichele #coconutoil
6215 2018-08-23 13:56:12 Arrogance, thy name is Big Oil. Cupidity, thy name is populism.
6216 2018-08-23 13:56:12 I now have owned my chevy trax for a year , the experience of buying my car was great thanks to mike lucidi at Davidson chevy watertown ny  and dealing with them for oil changes or what ever has always been a great experience love my chevys !!!!
6217 2018-08-23 13:56:02 Yes we are happy to consume position rather than american palm oil
6218 2018-08-23 13:55:51 Exactly,all they been doing is making up all this fake shit just to go invade some country and steal they resources mainly oil
6219 2018-08-23 13:55:49 to buy hemp oil for my face or na??
6220 2018-08-23 13:55:39 Texans are oilmen.  Oil is still a massive industry in the heart of Cruz’s district. He grew up in Houston.

Also... citizens united had very little to do with the election of Trump. I don’t recall big business being on board with his campaign.
6221 2018-08-23 13:55:39 I still believe my inversion call for 2018 will happen but it needs oil to break below $59. Once yields invert, Fed changing their language, limits possible future rate hikes
6222 2018-08-23 13:55:38 also hormones take control as well! I know you’re using essential oils & that’s super great. When you wash your face get a bowl of water & add drops of the essential oil & that’ll help too. Esty’s use that trick before using a real cleanser
6223 2018-08-23 13:55:34 Could be worse. Why did he put a neurosurgeon at the head of HUD? Why an anti environmentalist at the head of EPA? Why a chem engineer from an oil company as the Sec of State?
6224 2018-08-23 13:55:31 wow coconut oil got my skin looking edible.
6225 2018-08-23 13:55:27 Daw ain’t put enough oil 
6226 2018-08-23 13:55:19 Coconut oil is pure poison and “ kfc chicken will cure cancer”.
6227 2018-08-23 13:55:11 Olive oil lobby is undergoing losses so the attack on coconut oil.
6228 2018-08-23 13:55:09 I don’t mind the education (I did forget the disclaimer that oil and condoms don’t mix), but your parenthetical statement seemed judgmental.
6229 2018-08-23 13:55:02 Businessmen and greedy and heartless politicians (like Donald Trump) are responsible for supporting the use of coal, oil and increasing pollution and putting obstacles to the hydrogen revolution.
6230 2018-08-23 13:54:54 เราคงมีไอดอลด้านอื่นๆ มากจนเพียงพอแล้วก็เป็นได้
6231 2018-08-23 13:54:53 today's agenda is: 
- oil change
- scrub pants ( only have the shirt b/c the campus bookstore didnt have my pants in size...)
- dentist appointment 
- meet up a friend's brother and give him her gift
- maybe kpop store if I have time
- dinner with friend. :D
6232 2018-08-23 13:54:52 Louis Woodhill: "The high oil prices of 1980 were not real, and Reagan knew it.  They were being caused by the weakness of the U.S. dollar, which had lost 94% of its value in terms of gold between 1969 and 1980."
6233 2018-08-23 13:54:38 How do we know, what is taught in college is correct Science? For years, Coconut Oil is being used without ill effects. It is the way they make it ‘Pure’, that adds poison. The traditional methods of oil extraction retains purity. And ‘that’ is no mean science.
6234 2018-08-23 13:54:32 If I break your heart ebi oil spillage,I study your love for freedom college 
6235 2018-08-23 13:54:30 But the prez and his EPA says their isn't climate change??? Amazing how big oil companies change their minds when climate change will effect them...
6236 2018-08-23 13:54:23 No it was not. He was overspending on his public spending and then began borrowing from China to pay for it and he was warned about this overspending from the early 2000’s. 
Sound familiar hey? 
And he didn’t stop overspending when the oil price dropped. 
Sound familiar again!
6237 2018-08-23 13:54:20 Yes, let’s keep buying the oil from the Middle East and have any ugliness over there, not our country! And we know that western need for Middle East oil has caused many wars, but let’s not stop the wars & produce our own.
6238 2018-08-23 13:54:16 A quick search and rough math showed me that it takes over 18 lbs of corn to extract 1 cup of oil.
6239 2018-08-23 13:54:06 first we have front holes and back holes...now this??? where is that damn meteor???
6240 2018-08-23 13:54:05 Groundnut oil.... Abeg...
6241 2018-08-23 13:54:04 まって英語が良くわかってないんですけど　これオペラ座　ほかのきょくもかばーしてるの…？あいちゅん？
6242 2018-08-23 13:53:43 So he took their bodies, and dumped his two children into a oil pit, then made public pleas for help to find his missing family. 
Ummm yeah....no! What fact free bubble are you in?
6243 2018-08-23 13:53:32 What a finding!?
Fortunately the forefathers of people in costal belt of Karnataka and of Kerala didn't seek their advise on use of  coconut oil.
6244 2018-08-23 13:53:28 Yeah, between 1-1.5bn barrels of recoverable oil; Statoil discovered 130m barrels last year too. Lot of oil right there. Folk don’t appreciate that the west of Shetland is so fucking big that they’ve only surveyed a tiny %. Huge reserves there
6245 2018-08-23 13:53:17 Louis Woodhill: "It wasn’t Reagan’s massive defense build-up, or his Star Wars program, that drove the Soviet Union to the wall; it was the decline in real oil prices caused by the Reagan/Volcker/Greenspan strengthening of the U.S. dollar."
6246 2018-08-23 13:53:12 Dude - that article is from Australia. We all know things are different there.
6247 2018-08-23 13:53:02 วันนี้เหนื่อยแล้ววว
6248 2018-08-23 13:52:57 This is like saying "great news. Getting a new engine for my car after refusing to change the oil for 8 years"! @FLGovScott has reversed and blocked every attempt to fix this problem. He needs to be gone along with all of his flunkies.
6249 2018-08-23 13:52:44 Amazingly cute tiny essential oil pots for your car. Love mine and I can put a few drops of whatever oil I happen to need for the day!
6250 2018-08-23 13:52:38 Mix tea tree oil into coconut oil. Put it in a jar and keep it next to your bed. Helps with redness, zits, weird bumps, bug bites, yeast infections, etc.. I'm telling you this shit changed my LIFE
6251 2018-08-23 13:52:33 All you big oil assholes are going to disappear like the dinosaurs. The genie is out of the box and @elonmusk is taking no prisoners.
6252 2018-08-23 13:52:30 触った時にふんわりする感じのお胸な赤血球ちゃん
6253 2018-08-23 13:52:28 But, ... but, ... as an oil industry, we've ALWAYS relied upon the kindness of taxpayers.
6254 2018-08-23 13:52:24 いいね。
6255 2018-08-23 13:52:13 Yes i do.

Do you understand that Scotland raised £60Bn via taxation but gets £31Bn as a block grant?

Do you also understand that Scotland has to fund projects outwith Scotland and that Scotland gets an 8% share of Oil, when it should be 100%?
6256 2018-08-23 13:52:04 Simple, just like yoga, salt/neem as toothpaste, ghee, now coconut oil, first they mock people who have been using for generations, They introduce their own version of all stuffs and say they invented it, with people being so attracted towards west blindly accept whatever dey say
6257 2018-08-23 13:51:59 My brother been my ass about my new car. “Get these parts so we can do a tune up” “take it to get air in the tires” “did you put oil in it today?” “Lemme check the power steering to make sure it’s not leaking”. Like got damnit I already did it hoe!!
6258 2018-08-23 13:51:48 Doctors are also part of the scam. These days doctors say "use a different oil each time".. so that if no permanent shift, they can at least help these companies sell their products a bit more.
6259 2018-08-23 13:51:46 I glad your living the American dream, that is my goal as well. I based my opinions on my experience. I have been in oil and gas for 25 years, ran a company that was purchased by Dover for ($)91MM. Not my money. All I can say is the economy in Houston is booming under Trump.
6260 2018-08-23 13:51:43 @ChrisJansing
#MrTrump, n unrepentant liar, continues lying to Americans by taking full credit for a U.S. economy that began its upswing in 2009 under @BarackObama & has continued through 2018. It's time to start hammering #Trump on his snake oil sales pitch to low-info voters.
6261 2018-08-23 13:51:42 น่าจะแบบนั้นครับ โปรโมทน้อยก็ไม่น้อยอ่ะ ช่องทางให้ติดตามก็เยอะกว่า 4 ปีที่แล้วด้วย แต่บอกไม่ได้เหมือนกันว่าทำไมครับ 555
6262 2018-08-23 13:51:22 Try out drugstore/inexpensive!!! Every time I watch skincare videos and then look up products, the price hurts my heart. I know the best do cost more, but there has to be some cheaper ones just as good. Also, test on different skin types? Dry vs Oil.
6263 2018-08-23 13:51:14 Trader Joe's puts tea tree oil in everything.

They have tea tree oil in their mouthwash and I didn't even think you were supposed to put that in your mouth.
6264 2018-08-23 13:50:59 かえってきてやっとみられたふぁーーーおぺらざあああ
6265 2018-08-23 13:50:48 As long as EUR/USD doesn't break above 1.16 in the weekly chart (below 95 pts in the $DXY), the rally in $EEM and WTI crude oil is nothing but a dead cat bounce.
6266 2018-08-23 13:50:35 Big pharma controls the FDA. Big oil, Rockerfellers & their foundations in particular, took over education in this nation long ago. Well documented, again, if you choose to look.
6267 2018-08-23 13:50:27 Why aren't you bringing up the white dude who killed his pregnant wife and his two beautiful daughters I'm sorry he was a US citizen he dumped their bodies in oil tankers like garbage he was cheating on his wife was bankrupt but that isn't brought up cuz he's white right.......
6268 2018-08-23 13:50:20 I don’t believe the parties are the same, but I think we are on the same path, just a few decades behind. Wall St and the oil industry are desperately trying to turn us into the Republican Party, and much of the Democratic establishment have been bought by them.
6269 2018-08-23 13:50:20 Aug 23 Dalian Jan settlements yuan/mt - Corn 1889 +13, Soy 3684 -3, Meal 3165 -24, Oil 5868 -26.
6270 2018-08-23 13:50:16 too sensetive ...
6271 2018-08-23 13:50:15 Haha  every Senator out & ignoring her. Tells you a lot Australia, she’s a chip 30 times fried in rancid oil. That’s the reports from people that used her shop before she was gaoled. I use to think that barred you, but after today nope 
6272 2018-08-23 13:50:12 今下ネタスイッチ入ってるんで喋るんですけど赤血球ちゃんはCだと思ってます
6273 2018-08-23 13:50:04 They are shiva may be this professor never visit India. Or he got a big cheque from refined oil companies
6274 2018-08-23 13:49:59 Coconut oil is poison. Neem is not a good enough pesticide but now it’s patented as one. Yoga promotes Hinduism. Ghee is bad for your cholesterol.

Even our basmati rice has American patent on it.

Are we really this dumb to not see how this works?
6275 2018-08-23 13:49:50 Colorado Gas & Oil own Colorado....Figuring that out?
6276 2018-08-23 13:49:49 Previously she digged gold, now after oil reserves.
6277 2018-08-23 13:49:47 Tere or teri des ki kya aukat hai..ye sari duniya janti hai...china or america se bhikh me mili dollar par aakhri sans leta hua ek terroristan or ab IMF se bhikh mangta hua...de de allah ke nam par bhikh de de imf warna mai diwiya ho jaunga, crude oil kharidne ke liye de de.
6278 2018-08-23 13:49:40 Trump will not say though is that the illegal alien who killed Mollie was hired illegally hired farmhand by a "prominent" Republican & Trump supporter. Or the mother & her 2 daughters killed and stuffed in oil drums by the father in Colorado was a Republican & Trump supporter.
6279 2018-08-23 13:49:33 The problem is coconut oil is becoming a pretty big market and the industrial oil industry must not be happy
6280 2018-08-23 13:49:30 Yedor Gaidar: "The timeline of the collapse of the Soviet Union can be traced to September 13, 1985. On this date, Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani, the minister of oil of Saudi Arabia, declared that the monarchy had decided to alter its oil policy radically. (...)
6281 2018-08-23 13:49:30 It was pure oil not diluted in water
6282 2018-08-23 13:49:24 I think my hair is just a "regular" amount of porosity. If that makes sense. I'm watching some videos on low and high porosity hair and it seems to fall right in between. I use jajoba oil, tea tree and some coconut and I like it so far.
6283 2018-08-23 13:49:22 みんながそうやって炒められて揚げられて…ねぇ、誰のおかげ?誰のおかげかな?

＼It's OIL!!!／
6284 2018-08-23 13:49:21 If tulsi runs it will be the most important primary of all time. She could hit Bernie from the left, & peel off a sizeable portion of the right. That would be new territory though, where the war/oil establishment would be directly assaulted for the first time in decades
6285 2018-08-23 13:49:14 Data are from the EIA drilling report for new wells oil and gas 1 boe= 6 000 cf.
6286 2018-08-23 13:49:07 And the pipes will just affect diffs , so WCS will continue to trade at a discount to WTI until 2022 when TMX expands . Just saying the “world is awash in oil” thesis is the consensus / tourist view . If you dig into conventional prod’ the future looks grim on supply
6287 2018-08-23 13:49:00 Damn, I gotta bulk up for that volleyball scene!

Don't forget the baby oil!
6288 2018-08-23 13:48:57 Still fairly sure the sinking of Venuzuela  was a Bush GOP leftover game plan.... you know it is all aout the oil. Maduro asking for US gov help in his assination attempt major clue... just sayin.
6289 2018-08-23 13:48:51 Coconut oil is pure poison and coconut La Croix pure garbage.
6290 2018-08-23 13:48:39 We're hearing now from Bob Rocha at the New Bedford @whalingmuseum. Yankee whaling was one of the largest industries in the US--whale oil was used for lighting, and baleen was used for corsets, carriage parts, etc.

6294 2018-08-23 13:48:16 SESAME OIL!! I knew I was missing an ingredient! Got the mirin, but not the sesame oil. I'll keep an eye out for that again soon. Thanks mum!

6296 2018-08-23 13:48:15 Try an anti-inflammatory diet. Turmeric, Garlic, Ginger, Cayenne Pepper, Black Seed Oil, blueberries, strawberries, pineapple, coconut oil, extra virgin olive oil, bell peppers, tomatoes, cinnamon
6297 2018-08-23 13:48:04 Or maybe he doesn't? After spending all day crafting a murderous pinball machine, does Arcade really wind down with stuff that reminds him of work?

Maybe his recreation is oil painting, or listening to vintage classical recordings on vinyl?

6299 2018-08-23 13:47:52 Why oil companies under the instructions of Dharmendra Pradhan asking petrol pump owners to give all data of their employees?
They are asking the dealers/agencies to provide following details of their staffs
Aadhar cards
Religion
Sect/Caste

6301 2018-08-23 13:47:45 Wasn't Venezuela's downfall about being a threat to US national security rather than being shit at economics? Sanctions have existed since 2015 and they can't export their oil.
6302 2018-08-23 13:47:42 Could be diet related. Start keeping a meal journal. Carbs cause me to get inflammation and its almost like my rib cage is 2 sizes to small. If you can get CBD oil and are willing to try it, I can personally say it does wonders.
6303 2018-08-23 13:47:39 if anyone knows how to rig a juul so i can put cbd oil in it. hmu
6304 2018-08-23 13:47:37 Successful at running his country into the ground. He led Veneuzela down the path to the shit show it is today. It's easy to preach socialism whilst giving freebies from selling oil for $$ to all those terrible capitalists. If you think he was a success, go back to school.

6311 2018-08-23 13:46:48 As has been pointed out Venezuela has massive oil reserves but has not invested in its oil infrastructure, consequently, a fall in the world price of oil price coupled to falling production and exasperated by rampant corruption & poorly run economy has led to this position
6312 2018-08-23 13:46:44 Sulfur 8 and tea tree oil be waking my scalp tf up lol
6313 2018-08-23 13:46:37 Snake oil still abounds in this day and age, and parents get caught up in the cycle of wanting their kids to be the best and have every advantage. Scar tissue is the MSK "cavity" pedaled by manual therapists now.
6314 2018-08-23 13:46:23 Tea tree oil is supposed to help it. I never developed one but that’s what I was told when I got it pierced Incase it did.

6317 2018-08-23 13:46:11 i have really been wondering about this because for almost a year a i ate coconut oil w/ my cannabis, and never thought anything of it. my body didn't have any issues with it but maybe it wasn't very much at the time,  i barely ate fats like i do now. can coconuts be harmful? hm
6318 2018-08-23 13:46:04 @chris_tiu  whaa change oil jud kuya? Haha nahays wan!
6319 2018-08-23 13:46:01 Don't get confused. It is amount of oil which defines the vulnerability of cholesterol. The boiling point of oil defines the type of cooking expectations. Meat based deep frying require high BP oils and veg based requires low BP oil. Coconut oil can't be used for meat based food
6320 2018-08-23 13:45:57 Until they need their oil again
6321 2018-08-23 13:45:50 I’ve been cheating, and using those microwaveable pots! Just tip it into a frying pan, add a bit of sesame oil, tamari, drop of water, whatever, heat thru, yum!

6324 2018-08-23 13:45:34 D people dat killed d railways in Nigeria in preference for road haulage actually destroyed Nigeria's economy. If d amount of money spent on oil pipelines had been spent on railway devt Nigeria would have become a different country
6325 2018-08-23 13:45:30 And useless @Newsweek had an article saying coconut oil is unhealthy. They can pound sand. Establishment water carriers. Idiots.
6326 2018-08-23 13:45:25 What they oppose is nationalization of business. Especially oil and banks

6331 2018-08-23 13:44:54 If they consider it to be a myth, then this finding about the coconut oil isn't anything less than a myth.
6332 2018-08-23 13:44:46 Most angry about it haven’t actually read it. They think they teach anal to 4 year olds. That is the type of idiocracy we have... bafoons getting the oil because they squeak the most.
6333 2018-08-23 13:44:44 Our oil is in safe hands..you do research...!!!

6335 2018-08-23 13:44:42 Thank you @IcelandFoods for the huge improvement to the East Acton store. Such an impressive change. With action on palm oil and plastic waste too, I'm really happy to shop locally with you.
6336 2018-08-23 13:44:32 Manufacturing techniques and services have vastly changed. Many jobs created in new industries, finances and IT for example, and Science & Dev. Jobs were lost to automation, not to Oil funds. I wouldn’t say Scotland is poorer, SG and SNP dont either

6338 2018-08-23 13:44:24 we have to find out who funded his research. most of the times these are funded by big drug/cooking oil manufacturerors  to  further their own vested interests
6339 2018-08-23 13:44:21 (but like everyone should be using condoms so I'd just use the oil for something else tbh)
6340 2018-08-23 13:44:19 Me too... That means huge drop in oil prices Slow-down?
6341 2018-08-23 13:44:16 Starting in October, we'll be looking to buy CBD oil to put in edibles to help with certain ailments. I just hope I don't start to like the edibles too much. #ThursdayThoughts 
6342 2018-08-23 13:44:07 You're asking people who condescending explain to black people how they are suffering and how white people are going to fix it.
6343 2018-08-23 13:44:01 Greg, I love your camera. Made from oil products. Can you confirm the origin of the oil used to manufacture your camera?  Likely, #bloodoil was used. How many #LGBTQ deaths in dictator regimes occurred to make the oil, which manufactured your camera? I prefer ethical   oil.
6344 2018-08-23 13:43:57 Looks like he changed his oil with that towel prior to the round.
6345 2018-08-23 13:43:47 I definitely know how to change my oil and change a tire but I’m still calling my daddy

6349 2018-08-23 13:43:25 Politicizing a young white woman’s murder to garner votes.  Pathetic, in that a white male has just been arrested for strangling his family and depositing the bodies in vat of oil - no word from @GOP on this.
6350 2018-08-23 13:43:18 Alhamdullilah sedap dan insya allah vegetable oil.. aku hrap nexttime kita ke sna owner truck doughnuts yg famous tu masuk islam la dan pkai minyak klapa sawit instead of lard.
6351 2018-08-23 13:43:15 How long does it take for an oil change
6352 2018-08-23 13:43:14 You have a brand new oven, so try them roasted with some olive oil and a sprinkling of salt like @guanyinmiao suggests. Really brings out the sweetness.
6353 2018-08-23 13:43:11 Bet i start wearing baby oil instead of lotion

6355 2018-08-23 13:43:03 Is it not a curse on the world at large that Biafrans were and have continued to be incarcerated & killed  since 1904 with the open/secret diplomatic games of the British government and Nigeria (Sokoto Caliphate) respectively for zapping of God given natural resources (oil/gas)?
6356 2018-08-23 13:43:00 Yeah when you cite a meta analysis of a ton of odservational studies you absolutely CANNOT establish causation. I’m just mad that a ton of people will just go “ok no more coconut oil”

6361 2018-08-23 13:42:15 technology - battery and hydrogen storage of energy, solar and geothermal - it'll happen - shipping oil around will seem archaic- 2060
6362 2018-08-23 13:42:14 #LVCG strong, NT most of day

#MDZ great buying opportunity at a discount as big seller out. And a new big buyer in. 20% share discount available but limited stock. 

#AAOG going to see red to blue finish again?? Should see market liven up tomorrow ahead of oil show 28/29th.
6363 2018-08-23 13:42:07 I think #ukog is waking up..
6364 2018-08-23 13:42:06 I know a way to use around 10% less #fuel usage and so 10% of pollution. And 10% less costs for the ships. But it is only not in the interest of the oil companies! Amazing but truth. Possible for all fuel consumer devices. Proven!

6366 2018-08-23 13:41:52 #matd is drilling for 850m barrels of oil worth 2BILLION pounds.

We are fully funded for 6 drills.

We should have a share price of at least 15p!!      5% of what we are drilling for!

Oil is worth 3$/£2.36 a barrel in the ground.
6367 2018-08-23 13:41:50 Still better than American Monsanto . They will say anything to stop us from eating right . Coconut oil is used in south India for long . They want to increase sale of conola oil that have few takers .

6375 2018-08-23 13:41:18 Guys at the oil change place probably thought I was an idiot
6376 2018-08-23 13:41:07 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
6377 2018-08-23 13:41:07 8/10.

The fries are the hardest thing to get right. People often use those golden crispy fries, but for an authentic poutine, you need to have the really soggy, soft and brown kind of fries you get from using realllllllly old oil.
6378 2018-08-23 13:41:01 The tax giveaways US Oil Producers receive is a sham.  We should not give them one more dime.
6379 2018-08-23 13:40:59 Can't wait to move back up to cork so ive a frying pan that actually fries food that's not convex in shape so the oil runs down the sides leaving an oil exposed middle that just burns my fucking sausages :)

6383 2018-08-23 13:40:27 We are using coconut oil since ages. Not only for massage even for cooking. Then Indians are Zombies, if we have to believe what the professor says.
6384 2018-08-23 13:40:26 Yes exactly. Maybe they shouldn't report on reclamation. In fact, why bother doing at all. After all, the hypocritical people always telling them they don't do enough for the environment while they've done little themselves all while still consuming oil won't be happy either way
6385 2018-08-23 13:40:18 We're continually reviewing our packaging to reduce the amount used and the impact it has on our environment. The fact is however that plastic is the most suitable for containing blood and oil and also for maintaining... 1/2

6388 2018-08-23 13:40:08 lol @ everyone terrified of coconut oil now bc of one professor saying it is high in fat like uh didn’t ppl already know that...?

6397 2018-08-23 13:39:20 This is bullshit. The experimental evidence against saturated fat is tenuous and based more on storytelling than reality, there's no direct evidence that coconut oil in particular is harmful, and even granting the case against saturated fat calling it "pure poison" is absurd.

6400 2018-08-23 13:39:14 This set of figures makes clear that the problem of #deforestation resulting from #palmoil production results not from the use of palm oil for food, but for #biofuel, particularly #biodiesel. And, the #EU is the main culprit mandating its use.

6403 2018-08-23 13:39:05 2017 - Coconut oil is good for your health
2018 - Coconut oil is the devil itself
6404 2018-08-23 13:39:04 That amount can be totally covered by returning the oil extraction rates back to levels from just a few years ago. Basically, just to the same levels that are charged in Norway for the oil extracted there.

6429 2018-08-23 13:36:54 Gold-yuan contracts only exist in HK and Dubai. Iran could sell futures oil for yuan, and then buy gold futures for yuan in, say, HK. It would avoid using USD in any way. Whether they will do so is, of course, another matter.

6441 2018-08-23 13:35:41 That is becaus Konkanis and Keralites have evolved the cuisine and achieved a balance. they don't use #CoconutOil as a fad. And this professor does not refer to that aspect- fad and excess. Anyway, the good news is that we may not have to pay too mucch for our own coconut oil.

6443 2018-08-23 13:35:29 A white citizen strangled his wife and children, aborted his wife's fetus brutally in the process (there was going to be a gender reveal party and she wanted to keep it, based on that) - buried her in a shallow grave, put the kids in drums WITH oil. No GOP outrage. None.
6444 2018-08-23 13:35:13 Hu? The Chinese wanted the South Sudan oil contact only
You think out of the goodness of their hearts they wanted to send Farmers?
AND Now they are two separate nations...The Globalist land grabs was stop in it's tracks.

6449 2018-08-23 13:34:30 Norway, omitted from the graphs should never have based it’s economy on oil production, said only British nationalists furious at Scotland’s good fortunes.
6450 2018-08-23 13:34:25 Everyone got this right. Oil.  If it were not for oil SA would ride camels and live in tents still.  Research non oil GDP of SA sometime.  How many books have they published.  If (big if) we could wean off oil, it would wither and die.  And that would be a good thing.
6451 2018-08-23 13:34:20 I have a more violent reaction to oil of oregano than I do to hard liquor
6452 2018-08-23 13:34:11 Milking, oil blocks, contracts & unremitted revenues he denied govt accounts  WoW! All these without evidence? I thought I was responding to someone with brain, you're just another agent of beer parlour gist and propaganda. Your ignorance is duly acknowledged. Dig deep & learn.

6454 2018-08-23 13:34:03 What jobs did it create in Scotland? As I remember Bathgate, Linwood, Caterpillar, the Albion, Singer, most of the Shipbuilding, the Steel Industry & mines were all closed just as Oil was coming on stream In Scotland. Scotland Is the only country to find oil & become poorer.
6455 2018-08-23 13:34:03 Coconut Oil is bad now, or is this old hippie bitch just a nutjob, I'll go with the latter.
6456 2018-08-23 13:34:00 @Harvard is a shitty school, who stole all the major Indian research and patent it to their credit. You charge exorbitant amount of money to give education and by product is shit heads who claim coconut oil is poison. #CoconutOil

6458 2018-08-23 13:33:59 Donald Trump acts so swiftly to respond to fake claims of white genocide in South Africa (a country the USA has little to do with) and yet America has murdered at least 4 MILLION Muslims since 9/11...for oil. Will Trump ever call THAT a genocide?
6459 2018-08-23 13:33:53 If coconut oil is pure poison, we are all Neelkanth!
6460 2018-08-23 13:33:52 What you must have said - the high amount of saturated fat in coconut oil outweighs its benefits of improving the HDL cholesterol in blood- but what you say? It’s pure poison . Now deal with this nation that’s gone ape sh!t! #harvard #india

6467 2018-08-23 13:33:11 I  do not doubt the many advantages of Canola oil. What I do not get (not an expert) is that any burning of organic material generates CO2, the gas that is causing greenhouse affect. Burning Canola also does it. What else is in the picture?

6493 2018-08-23 13:30:32 Further many Indian oil refineries like Reliance SEZJamnagar, refine crude oil  for other countries on contract/jobworkbasis. (ie importing crude oil refining it and exporting oil on which no tax is payable) obviously the price of such oil is less than oil sold in domestic market
6494 2018-08-23 13:30:31 behind the scenes, they said the winning percentage and money for university outweighed any allegations.

6501 2018-08-23 13:30:00 How else are we supposed to eat the ram without it being slaughtered? Should we just dump it inside hot oil? Cattle, goats,chicken and even pigs are slaughtered. What makes this one different?

6503 2018-08-23 13:29:43 It really just depends on on your hair type. Low porosity hair tends to just be stiff when using coconut oil. If you've never had an issue with hair strength or if you're regularly using a protein product/treatment it's not the oil for you.

6508 2018-08-23 13:29:23 Obviously we need to export our Gay friendly oil. Canada is broke, we need the money for our healthcare system. Oil demand will INCREASE for 20 years.

6509 2018-08-23 13:29:18 This’s crazy, what about people who are using coconut oil from only God knows when . But they are alive even healthier than that so called professor . He has nothing to talk about , he’s just making noise for to know that he also exists.

6524 2018-08-23 13:28:03 The closest the US got to a “financial crisis” in that era was the “Salad Oil Scandal.”
That scandal wouldn’t even have made page 5 of the business section in 2009...

6533 2018-08-23 13:27:17 If you have hives mix: 
-Bentonite Clay 
-Apple Cider Vinegar (or water)
-Witch Hazel 
-Coconut Oil
-Vitamin E Oil 

(You really only need the first 2 but I want this shit gone so I’m being extra). Let it sit until it’s dry or cracking. Test the clay on your skin first!

6534 2018-08-23 13:27:16 I wonder what the average oil revenues per year have been over the last 40 eh ?

6559 2018-08-23 13:25:34 Scotland cannot borrow. Our deficit is our percentage of UK Govt debt. In an independent Scotland, we wouldn't be paying for Trident, HS2, Big Ben, the Houses of parliament, Buckingham Palace, Heathrow Term etc etc. 

Figures look great when Scotland takes its oil back.
6560 2018-08-23 13:25:31 Wait, I call foul, or at least a need for disambiguation! Most uses of aioli are a subspecies of mayo and thus fall under its umbrella. (If you meant by aioli "an emulsion of olive oil, garlic, and salt, and that's it, it's a different story).

6567 2018-08-23 13:24:29 Why does conservative compassion always have to have a dollar figure included. Yes people are fleeing to Canada but think of the cost is what they are saying. I'd rather my tax dollars help someone than say...subsidizing big oil.

6570 2018-08-23 13:24:13 African countries in fact rely on their natural resources. Botswana economy is dependent on diamonds, Equatorial Guinea has a very high GDP per capita because of its oil, and so on. Most of the continent's natural resources have remained there. How could this be different?

6577 2018-08-23 13:23:09 These are all sponsored articles and baseless research, saw the same in TOI, some good corporates are behind this, scaring people who want to try coconut oil.
6578 2018-08-23 13:23:08 Amazing how @POTUS claims conflict of Interest for Mueller's team, while working with and allowing oil, fossil fuel, and mining industries to pollute and destroy our lands...
6579 2018-08-23 13:22:58 Coconut oil is used for cooking in the rural Caribbean. It's only issue is the tendency to "sleep".
6580 2018-08-23 13:22:56 Norway's "nationalized" oil company is traded on the NYSE, and operates on the profit motive. Profits that it deposits in a fund that is active on the stock market, mostly in American corporations. To make more profit. Unlike Venezuela. 

God Bless Capitalism.
6581 2018-08-23 13:22:48 Yes. Many of his supporters are daft and have bought his snake oil.
6582 2018-08-23 13:22:46 Ineffective climate change policy. No open & transparent government. Failure to restore Harper's gutting of environmental protections. Ignoring science, evidence, and best practices on most policies, especially physician assisted death. Increasing oil & gas exploitation...
6583 2018-08-23 13:22:35 he’s a snake oil salesman who’ll lie to cover himself. Interesting it doesn’t bother you when his lies pile up - no campaign contacts w/ Russia, oh just a few, oh it’s about adoption, oh it’s politics but everyone does it, etc. You WANT to be lied to, but why?
6584 2018-08-23 13:22:27 Why isn't the fake news asking Elizabeth Warren about her stance on allowing white male oil workers from Colorado to remain in this country?
6585 2018-08-23 13:22:10 #IfIWereInKindergarten I wouldn’t eat @Elmers paste straight out of the jar like I used to! 
I’d spread it on toasted French bread and drizzle it with olive oil and sea salt.
6586 2018-08-23 13:21:57 I read somewhere that coconut oil have glycerides which is converted to ketones by the lever these ketones are acting as energy source for brain cells and help those having parkinsons disease. May be someone who knows more about it can elaborate
6587 2018-08-23 13:21:55 I have fine high porosity hair which is ideal for coconut oil.
6588 2018-08-23 13:21:54 Today, I am just excited to be excited & to see so many others being excited about the things they do; like meeting someone, eating peas or standing in front of an oil tanker. I am grateful that they share this excitement with me & the rest of the world. Positivity rocks!

6591 2018-08-23 13:21:42 Be careful of coconut oil. More research is needed, for we have seen conflicting clinical results. #plowon
6592 2018-08-23 13:21:34 “I have very oily skin and I’m looking for a tinted moisturizer” 

You do realize that tinted moisturizers are typically oily? And even if they aren’t oil based they sit on top of your skin as a layer of protection. They’re not meant to sink.
6593 2018-08-23 13:21:34 With respect, David, I don't know any boomers who own an oil company, a television station, or a major newspaper.  Not then, and not ever.  They're a different crowd.
6594 2018-08-23 13:21:28 If only they had oil.
6595 2018-08-23 13:21:27 My dentist said it's great that I oil pull.  I love it for my hair. My hair is usually braided under wigs or in crochet braids etc. It keeps it really healthy and my hair has never been softer than when I started using it.
6596 2018-08-23 13:21:16 Again utter nonsense! Venezuela is oil rich ffs ... you are a corrupted politicians wet dream and will obviously believe anything that suits your bias and agenda ... I’m done here have a nice life
6597 2018-08-23 13:21:01 はー……グズマさん……
6598 2018-08-23 13:20:59 No you are. It’s the Marist policies that have brought the country to its knees. And when you talk about an oil war, remember who started it and remember also Venezuela are a founding member of OPEC too. They could have voted against flooding the market with oil.
6599 2018-08-23 13:20:57 $CBV is a tiny oil producer with revenu trading under cash value with no debt. More wells are coming into production. Extra low float, worth a look for a bounce here. Sitting at 0.09$ now #cashrich #oil #tsxv #tsx #cse

6615 2018-08-23 13:18:55 OTD 1973: In preparation for the Yom Kippur War, Saudi king Faisal and Egyptian president Anwar Sadat meet in Riyadh and secretly agree that the Arabs will use the 'oil weapon' as part of the military conflict.
6616 2018-08-23 13:18:54 The CIA/US coup against their democracy was in what .. 1953? The hostage crisis was a direct result of the USA meddling in affairs they illegally meddled with because the UK wanted cheap oil.

NATGAS 1H needs to continue above 20MA & then test 50MA higher today to cointnue 5th wave higher on 1D. WATCH UGAZ
6619 2018-08-23 13:18:31 I always wake up & get my oil changed earlyyyyy like soon as the shop open

6622 2018-08-23 13:18:24 Right on! No one is going after domestic out-of-state oil workers due to the countless unsolved murders of Native American women living on reservations! Why are not these same critics addressing this issue?
6623 2018-08-23 13:17:49 I just starting putting MCT oil in my coffee and my life has forever changed
6624 2018-08-23 13:17:49 I'll occasionally use it for oil pulling. This one chick swears by it but dentist never aknowledge it as an actual benefit. But I think drs are a scam so that doesn't matter. How do you like it for you hair?
6625 2018-08-23 13:17:45 Weapons Grade Snake Oil by @blairbidmead! It's completely standalone, and HILARIOUS, and fantastic, and gory, and cyberpunky, and brutal, and wild, and it's got a dude steering his TARDI— I mean, timeship through the power of tentacle fucking!
6626 2018-08-23 13:17:44 I'm Jewish. We think Evangelicals are, shall we say, not all there. Whatever. As long as the US keeps supporting Israel. Which is actually a good thing. 

But, Israel needs to give the Palestinians their own state & stop this charade creating strife to keep oil prices jacked up.
6627 2018-08-23 13:17:43 Someone teach me how to change my oil bc I’m so tired of car shops k thx
6628 2018-08-23 13:17:35 How so? Tesla and GM are almost done with their tax credit limit. All manufacturers got the same deal. But there is no limit to us subsidizing the multi trillion dollar oil industry. I say cancel all subsidies.
6629 2018-08-23 13:17:28 Aah... Yam is another one o... So itcy ur hands will start reddening but they say rubbing palm oil on your hands cures it...
6630 2018-08-23 13:17:28 The process I offered shows financial incentives to set about reducing the monstrous amounts of plastic polluting our world. Your solution will have zero effect on that. The greens have been saying stop oil extraction for decades but offer no incentive for it only additional cost
6631 2018-08-23 13:17:22 ... Graph 2 of new well production Month to Month, shows decrease in oil production the last few months versus rig count.  However, I couldn't duplicate your GOR response with a 1BOE=6000cf conversion.  If you will, is this overall production, new well production?  Data source?
6632 2018-08-23 13:17:13 If I knew how to change my own tires, changed my own oil, etc I wouldn’t be at this shop with Carlito
6633 2018-08-23 13:17:06 We now sell #CBD OIL.  A 2015 analysis of previous studies concluded that CBD oil is a promising treatment for numerous forms of anxiety, including social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and PTSD
6634 2018-08-23 13:17:04 Need a good face moisturizer. Coconut oil too oily.
6635 2018-08-23 13:17:02 Hello! We would like to confirm that our fries are cooked in the same oil as the chicken. Our sincerest apologies on behalf of the staff at the Nottingham branch we are going to investigate this further to ensure this will not happen again. Thank you for letting us know!
6636 2018-08-23 13:17:01 If we didn’t have an incompetent Tory Government we could tax oil revenue as the Norwegians do and half this “notional” deficit overnight. Tompkins if you don’t know that you’re an ignoramus. If you do, you’re a lying charlatan.
6637 2018-08-23 13:16:53 Just amazing $lb that the management buffoons at Limited Brands can't be a bit more personable and upbeat on earnings call.

6638 2018-08-23 13:16:43 Seriously, I'm a virgin! Where do you think they get virgin olive oil?
6639 2018-08-23 13:16:38 U r just trying to defend yourselves. Britain corrupted black leaders with incentives which they don't have and those who refused were killed. It's still happening in Nigeria where they succeeds to use Islamic north to suppress Christian South to control their oil
6640 2018-08-23 13:16:33 #Crude oil output potentially could increase from the Alaska North Slope (ANS) Basin as much as 40% during the next eight years, according to new research from analytics firm IHS Markit. @Kallanish #OOTT #ANS

6645 2018-08-23 13:16:01 A Harvard professor claims coconut oil is "pure poison."  Which explains why a critic of Vladimir Putin was just found full of coconut oil.

6649 2018-08-23 13:15:49 Let's keep buying their oil...ugh. Can't we see the benefits of the domestic pipeline in terms of human cost? We need to stop doing business with this country and its regime.
6650 2018-08-23 13:15:43 I will never forget Shanann, Celeste & Bella, murdered by their own husband and father. The monster killed his toddlers, threw them in an oil tank, left them there for several days while he awaited the return of their mother, so he could murder her too.  STOP politicizing murder.

6655 2018-08-23 13:15:05 Maybe we can get the companies that use palm oil in their products to donate. A social media campaign can work wonders these days.

6681 2018-08-23 13:13:03 Generally it’s used to seal hair, like seal in the moisture after you shampoo and condition. I’ve never heard of it being used as a hot oil treatment or anything, but I suppose it could be. I’d suggest first putting it on your ends (with hair still wet) and see how you like it.

6689 2018-08-23 13:12:09 We switched to non coconut oils because of the cholesterol scare made by the lobbies. A few years back switched back to coconut oil. Used by generations and it is the best for us.
6690 2018-08-23 13:11:56 This is half the picture. All exports including oil are charged tax at zero percent rate & payment is in foreign currency. Tax is changed by union / state governments only on goods sold in India & not outside india ie exports. This causes an increase in price of goods (ie oil)
6691 2018-08-23 13:11:54 The Lord is about to shut the door. Don’t be a foolish virgin with no oil.

6695 2018-08-23 13:11:33 I find it interesting that you think electric cars are not going anywhere, I worked for an oil refinery for thirty years and understand the industry completely... do you?  Do you understand that the Technology of the electric car is far superior to that of the ICE CAR?
6696 2018-08-23 13:11:32 so why do we deal with them instead of using our own oil?

6701 2018-08-23 13:10:50 Or the figures are skewed that way to promote that lie, for example Scottish Oil revenues a chunk of them are unallocated and end up in "London numbers", what about Whisky,  Gin, Welsh Cheese, exports?
6702 2018-08-23 13:10:31 And it was not the USA who started an oil war. That was OPEC countries. Mainly Saudis Arabia.
6703 2018-08-23 13:10:27 the ones i take are customized based on my health goals, so currently taking vitamin C, probiotics, fish oil, ashwaganda and kana (last 2 are to help relieve stress). so main focus for me is immunity, energy and stress.
6704 2018-08-23 13:10:19 I'm trying to remember when the Yes side said that they would depend on oil revenues. And failing. Iceland and Denmark don't have oil (or not much) and they seem to live a lot better than we do.
6705 2018-08-23 13:10:17 Keep telling yourself that.  BTW, Where's Pence?  How are those oil prices? Is it Friday yet?

6709 2018-08-23 13:09:55 I posted a news story about Texas exporting more oil than importing.  Facebook removed it because they said it looks like spam.  I guess they want to suppress anything that looks like good news for America.

6741 2018-08-23 13:07:06 They need something to make it look like the Carbon Capture Coalition and their bipartisan supporters are meeting some resistance. NRDC like this because it makes #CCUS and #EOR seem more appealing and urgent to the credulous masses. #NEORI #coal #oil #CO2

I've heard drinking motor oil greases up the shitter.  Should try it.
6748 2018-08-23 13:06:29 It's no secret it's super fatty. I would need to see more studies to believe all of this but everything I use it for is not food anyway. I've been using it for years in my hair and oil pulling.

6751 2018-08-23 13:06:09 and as for the US and its plan to harvest the trillion dollar minerals in Afg, (like they plundered Iraq for oil and gold), China and Russia wont allow this to happen. Things will work out bw Afg and Pak, just a matter of time! Just how we made Russians our friend, u will see ;)

6770 2018-08-23 13:03:52 You have seemingly missed the whole point of the article ... it was a calculated attack by USA, Saudi Arabia and Israel. They flooded their market with cheaper oil fgs! This is nothing to do with the UK
6771 2018-08-23 13:03:50 He's threatening. He's a con artist. Make ppl believe it's against their interests to impeach him. Snake oil.
6772 2018-08-23 13:03:48 Yes we chose to invest rather than do an Oil fund aka Norway. And i am of no doubt, there will have been waste, but during the 90’s there was massive infrastructure spending across the UK, Education, Health & Defence, harsh to say it was all wasted. Created countless jobs

6777 2018-08-23 13:02:56 Rupee weakened against the US Dollar today, because of Dollar demand by foreign banks and importers. Also, the strength in Dollar index and higher crude oil prices weighed the currency down. However, Dollar sale by a private bank and PSU banks kept the losses in check.

6779 2018-08-23 13:02:50 Percentage wise, how much palm oil demand comes from Europe and the United States?
6780 2018-08-23 13:02:43 How is inflation going to be stopped by backing up the VEB (a fiat currency) with a “cryptocurrency”-controlled by those who initially destroyed the value of that fiat currency-‘tied’ to barrels of oil of a country in default, whose major oil company can’t repay its debts either?
6781 2018-08-23 13:02:34 Government bond prices ended lower today,as Rupee depreciation against the Dollar deepens the fear of FPI outflows from Indian debt market. Also, the overnight increase in crude oil prices triggered the fear of domestic inflation to be higher this time that weighed down sentiment

6788 2018-08-23 13:01:38 USA is still buying Venezuela's oil.  

The crisis is not down to oil crisis of 2014. It predates that and oil sales to the USA increased in 2017/18 from a lower total the year before.

6841 2018-08-23 12:56:13 In India, generations have used / consumed coconut oil, all lived long healthy lives. Majority in current gen changed due to misinformation. Results: cancer,BP,diabetes and more disease for which we fall prey everyday! Enough now!
6842 2018-08-23 12:55:59 It's pure business of multinational companies and developed countries, after few days there will be a new chemical oil in the market. Understand the game.
6843 2018-08-23 12:55:55 Agreed, how can a snake oil salesman achieve this. Unfucking believable
6844 2018-08-23 12:55:54 Oh ok! Hmm. Odd. Overactive sebum/oil glands, then? That wouldn’t show up on blood work. Maybe a dermatologist would be able to shed some light on this?
6845 2018-08-23 12:55:52 My dad while laying under my car draining the oil, but the jack is very sketchy... says "Pray for me says the man who doesn't believe in god to the girl who also doesn't believe in god"  
6846 2018-08-23 12:55:44 I did read it, which is why I commented as I did. If falling oil prices could cause such a catastrophe then they would have caused it for the USA, the UK, Iran etc etc etc.
6847 2018-08-23 12:55:44 I’m not a fan of coconut oil, but to call it “poison” is ridiculous. Cyanide, ricin....those are poisons. Villainizing foods helps no one.
6848 2018-08-23 12:55:35 And people In South India and South Asia who consume COCONUT OIL '''SO CALLED SATURATED FAT" in 80% of their food items have lower heart attack rate then AMERICANS AND ENGLISH who don't use any coconut oil in their food.
6849 2018-08-23 12:55:16 So I thought putting my baby oil and lotion on my thighs would be a good idea the other day, I was wrong. No one told me it would make them sweat.

6854 2018-08-23 12:55:02 The underlying message from Fluffy is that if oil revenues WERE honestly represented as part of Scotland's revenues (unknown region) independence would be a racing certainty!

6856 2018-08-23 12:54:53 What’s the progressive conservatives position on hydraulic fracturing and onshore oil and gas?  The projects on the west coast of Newfoundland would help lower taxes and also lower the employment rate. There is no pause on hydraulic fracturing offshore   Why the double standards?

6859 2018-08-23 12:54:41 Beware of the snake oil salesman out there.  Nobody meets face-to-face with coaches every week.  Check references.

6875 2018-08-23 12:53:05 Who the fuck said it was poisoned? 
Studies have confirmed that coconut oil is the least harmful substance that's included in a variety of products to avoid lethal accidental consumption consequences.

6883 2018-08-23 12:51:59 It's not oil in the water. The port is too shallow to receive a tanker, so they have a Single-Buoy Mooring (SBM) station which they tether to by hose(s). From there, the SBM has an underwater pipeline which feeds the shore storage tanks. Thanks.

6902 2018-08-23 12:50:23 But... But...I thought Scotland supported the whole of the UK with it's oil revenues? Isn't that why they receive £1,500 per head more than the rest of the UK?
6903 2018-08-23 12:50:20 ...materials cost. It was true that the cost of panels had reduced as large manufacturers upscaled. Unfortunately the consequence of such a dramatic cut in subs was the loss of many small solar biz like my own. What I can't figure is why not cut subs to oil, gas, and nuclear too?
6904 2018-08-23 12:50:19 @cspanwj We need to wean off Oil & Coal and take a hint from Mother Earth herself and get our energy the same way she does...From Wind, Solar, & Tidal Energy...

6909 2018-08-23 12:49:27 You lost the popular vote by millions. The coal miners believed you. The working poor believed you but you only cared about the 1%. Your snake oil isn't fooling most of them anymore. The cult of personality is ending. You will go to jail.

6911 2018-08-23 12:49:10 make sure ur shampoo or whatever you use isn’t too drying/stripping your skin of oil, that causes it to produce more! also an antibacterial oil like tea tree or meadowfoam *make sure u DILUTE!!! them!!!* & made into a spray could help clear things up
6912 2018-08-23 12:49:02 His lies were always there. 

Snake oil purchasers are beginning to stop the lies they’ve told themselves.
6913 2018-08-23 12:48:59 Iran sanctions -China takes a quarter of all Iran’s oil exports, and with Chinese banks little exposed to the US it can avoid the impact of Trump’s sanctions. China & possibly Russia only 2 countries may be able to avoid US sanctions.

6915 2018-08-23 12:48:54 We do need saturated fats (7-8%) in our daily consumption and coconut oil could be one source. Claiming that any one food is a poison can be dangerous as it instils fear around food. It's important to remember that no one food is inherently all 'good' or all 'bad'. That’s all :).
6916 2018-08-23 12:48:49 First of all, saving money till I'm fully ready to settle down is different from being scared. I'm currently in my final year studying Petroleum Engineering. I work part time as an Industrial Trainee in an Oil Servicing Company. I'm not saying no one should have kids under 25.
6917 2018-08-23 12:48:36 I would love to hang then you do read this please reply with my oil change on 10/12.

Save me with your moral incorrect story!!
6927 2018-08-23 12:47:27 Gee,  I must have missed the rest of the oil producing countries running 1million % inflation and eating zoo animals when their revenues from oil tanked!

He dumped them all in an oil container like trash.

Said they're missing.
He was having an affair & is bankrupt.

6932 2018-08-23 12:47:00 Transportation of crude oil from Turkana to Mombasa resumes after nearly 50 days of stand-off between a local community and the Government.
6933 2018-08-23 12:47:00 All this things will be replaced by other more sustainable materials.The science is already there , now its about the costing. In our life time we will stop using oil completely.

6935 2018-08-23 12:46:49 Totally Yay! Little salt, pepper and olive oil!
6936 2018-08-23 12:46:43 I prefer to think of it as welfare from the rest of America, since it's all based on oil income from federally owned oil reserves.
6937 2018-08-23 12:46:41 I’d take that deal anytime
6938 2018-08-23 12:46:38 I was also told by my aesthetician that it’s probably best to avoid coconut oil + products that contain it because it clogs your pores and  doesn’t allow the natural oil in your skin to break through, causing the oil to get trapped under your skin causing acne and blackheads.
6939 2018-08-23 12:46:26 1 more day to order tickets for the Lucas Oil game. lmk if you want one!!

6942 2018-08-23 12:45:44 @CBSThisMorning @NorahODonnell the interview on the coconut oil being poison. The expert promotes a plant base diet. Why didnt you say what about Glycophosphate? ? @RepJoeKennedy

6945 2018-08-23 12:45:33 The idea driving current U.S. policy is the belief that financial sanctions can hurt the Venezuelan government without causing serious harm to ordinary Venezuelans. That’s impossible when 95 percent of Venezuela’s export revenue comes from oil sold by the state-owned oil company
6946 2018-08-23 12:45:26 The calculations by Jim Feehan submitted to the PUB showed a heat pump will be about the same cost as oil (and that’s not taking into account the capital cost)
6947 2018-08-23 12:45:15 I need an oil change

6957 2018-08-23 12:44:18 Hehe...I have added cold pressed coconut oil my Mother's diet...So I am sold on this. 

For people at large in India, esp the argumentative gen X Y & Z, we will have to create scientific evidence.

6962 2018-08-23 12:44:06 It may be working. The youthful attendant behind the counter at the movie theater cheerfully volunteered that their popcorn was popped with pure coconut oil.
6963 2018-08-23 12:44:00 The Cohen plea deal that includes campaign stuff is a publicity stunt with Lanny Davis selling the snake oil. Can you believe they shovel this garbage via MSM daily? You can get more authenticity on Ancient Aliens…. (proven in the ratings)

"But look at all the evidence Scully. Don't tell me you think the black oil is just.. what.. the oil we pump in our cars?" 

He quirked his eyebrow, questioningly.

6974 2018-08-23 12:43:05 The only way we can stop this is to boycott palm oil products but then what is to stop the poor farmers growing something else. This is happening worldwide and has been for centuries with many crops and habitats. Too many humans !!!
6975 2018-08-23 12:43:05 Coconut oil is overrated
6976 2018-08-23 12:42:55 Where can I get Castor oil & shea butter???
6977 2018-08-23 12:42:52 Really? Which currency do you think oil & gold are priced in? When the Rand goes to Zim$ levels, what will food cost? Who will be here to produce it? Will the current govt know how to set up companies like Sasol / Yskor or be able to run them? Look at the SOEs before answering.
6978 2018-08-23 12:42:50 That's a good one. 

Cumin, paprika, five spice, all spice, coriander, cinnamon and mustard are must haves.

But I also think you need mirin, fish oil, white, red and apple cider vinegar; brown sugar and chicken stock are necessary.
6979 2018-08-23 12:42:49 So let’s address the oily matter because I am not understanding. You put palm oil on yourself before you take pictures or what ?

6981 2018-08-23 12:42:36 I boiled olive oil and chilli flakes together with garden garlic and sage. I also put dried up ghost peppers from the garden into my local honey so I have spicy honey. Also, the DJ confirmed for #BohemianBonfire and this morning is off to a great start. 
6982 2018-08-23 12:42:32 Now now, no need to play the ethno card.  Australians of all stripes go in for this Americanised, infantile way of speaking.  Just saw good private school Anglo boy Peter Garrett pronounce it thus in the film Midnight Oil 1984.  Like your work, just want our ABC to speak bedder.

6992 2018-08-23 12:41:53 Everything you just told us about coconut oil might be a lie
6993 2018-08-23 12:41:52 In these stale times, show up with fresh oil. It will shift the atmosphere and break the chains. #Anointed
6994 2018-08-23 12:41:49 i did a lchf diet in 2012...lost a lot of weight, felt great and was spooning 5 tablespoons of coconut oil, along with 100-150 grams protein, and about 5-10 grams carbs....blood sugar was a constant 75-80....maybe 85 couple times a week...just reporting in!!
6995 2018-08-23 12:41:46 drunk trucks too much oil they have drunk
6996 2018-08-23 12:41:44 But thats not entirely accurate though is it. Are you suggesting we always get less back? Even SG own figures, and NS admit there are time we benefit, i.e. oil crashes. We would have had to slash public spending to stay afloat
6997 2018-08-23 12:41:42 
6998 2018-08-23 12:41:18 No irony. If people want self determination they should have it. Scotland will simply swap one master for another and will have to live without subsidy and depleted oil. Ireland will have to pay for the North and inherit its appalling difficulties. But I doubt either will happen.
6999 2018-08-23 12:41:08 Yes.. What you mentioned here is right.. But overuse might create problem.. Just like Keralites Make dishes with coconut oil and put scrapered coconut in that.. 
Lack of exercise after having such dishes certainly increases the amount of LDL and triglycerides

7016 2018-08-23 12:39:19 But this is also dishonest. Alaska, as a state, receives the most federal tax dollars of any state or territory. Basically, federal dollars are funding their roads, schools, and state employees, and their oil revenue sends money directly to citizens.

7030 2018-08-23 12:38:04 If you’re using the wrong oil, for example, or filling a car that calls for higher octane fuel with the lowest octane stuff you can buy, you may run the risk of voiding your warranty, and worse, causing damage that’ll cost more to fix than you’d save by using the cheap stuff.

7166 2018-08-23 12:24:46 Like most headlines when it comes to Nutrition, coconut oil was never as life changing as people stated and also not 'Poison' as now stated, think the Wicks crew went over board splashing it on everything. The poison is in the dosage.

7176 2018-08-23 12:23:38 The drop in production is more related to the fact that Venezuela is becoming increasingly unable to operate those oil companies after their rather harsh treatment of the management.
7177 2018-08-23 12:23:16 It's all on the backdrop of them being an oil rich nation as well. But 1m% inflation is just bonkers. Just a shame as ever it's the general population that are suffering.

She even applies it on her hair everyday and uses it for body massage twice a week. If this is poison, get me a shipload plz.
7182 2018-08-23 12:22:50 But you know that the US wants prices high enough for shale to be viable while SA wants a price just below that where it is not. All world players get to manipulate oil prices, but the ideal prices for Venezuela align with the interests of OPEC.

7184 2018-08-23 12:22:47 The student loan program was created with high aspirations and goals. It was taken over by snake oil salesmen and the entire education system of this country has suffered while a few made huge amounts of money. The repercussions from this will reverberate for generations.
7185 2018-08-23 12:22:32 Some info on how to find a registered psychologist/therapist and their company/charity registration for accountability would also be useful in stopping some of the snake oil sellers !
7186 2018-08-23 12:22:26 No, it's not a fancy dressed up tax.

See that's why you're wrong.
A tax is something all the people of the state pay.

The oil revenue is money received from leases.

There are worlds of difference.

1 money comes in "free"
2 money comes from pocket.

7198 2018-08-23 12:21:14 If DC for instance, wanted to institute a "dividend" to residents similar to the oil fund, it could, by placing a portion of its nearly billion dollar surplus into a fund that then pays out a portion to each citizen
7199 2018-08-23 12:21:07 It is a factor dumbo a factor. Go tell your friends in Saudi Arabia they mustn't take account of their oil & gas revenue.
7200 2018-08-23 12:20:52 but it's not a "universal basic income" in today's vernacular.

and not all states have oil reserves.

Which is the main thing, not all states have assets (beyond tax revenues) that are viable revenue generators.

and eventually those checks will stop.

2. They can't just use the water only for generating power but need to conserve it for irrigation also
3. Most of pak's power comes from imported furnace oil for which we are struggling to pay
7203 2018-08-23 12:20:31 India and China have done oil deals with Iran in the last 2 weeks that bypass every sanction and the entire Financial System, making implementing or enforcing any sanctions impossible. The size of these deals is so large, Iran doesn't need any other Customers.

7227 2018-08-23 12:18:57 2/ My expectation is this will drive mkt to give more credit to the peak divergence narrative. that and $ positioning, improvement in trade narrative will help keep the bid alive in €. Combined with high oil prices and low AHE this gives us lower real rate and higher XAU

7264 2018-08-23 12:14:41 Since coconut oil came under their radar, they will make all efforts to make it poison.
7265 2018-08-23 12:14:39 In this magnificent year of 2018 I see all of our brave boy prancing around the oil fields in the middle east and our country bowing to the Communists in Asia i say we rally up our boys for some glory and end this national debit we have.

7269 2018-08-23 12:14:01 It’s more media snake oil, part of the “pity the poor people” working in the WH.  I’m weary from reading it. The narrative should be on the mobster mentality of the Bully in Chief.

7283 2018-08-23 12:12:40 1/ Dried halves of coconut are ground and oil is extracted. Drink 100 mL of it every morning before eating anything. One or two lemons’ juice with 1 L or water should be cosumed. And 10-15 almonds should also be consumed. For breakfast some brown rice with a veg/meat curry.

7302 2018-08-23 12:11:31 Indeed; they nationalised vast swathes of industry "in the public good", which decimated underlying productivity. The whole thing was only kept afloat by their oil, and once that pillar fell it all came crashing down. Worth remembering UK isn't sat on world's largest oil reserves

7339 2018-08-23 12:07:53 @NicolaSturgeon our deficit is 4 times the rest of UK. You argue we’re on the right trajectory, but the decline in deficit is less than UK and due to rising oil revenues. @theSNP is failing to improve schools, health and transport, whilst spending is out of control #SNPout
7340 2018-08-23 12:07:41 Will the Indonesian government levy tax on the proceeds of the land which it’s purpose is for palm oil plantation? The government can take back the land if the land is not developed and used for the purpose it has been zoned for. How are you suppose to pay for the fine and tax?
7341 2018-08-23 12:07:28 no.

it's a dividend check on a state owned asset.

not all states have hella oil reserves.

therefore not all states can issue fat checks to residents.

7355 2018-08-23 12:04:35 How do you create higher prices on oil? Manufacture a shortage.
7356 2018-08-23 12:04:30 As in coconut oil being unhealthy is incorrect
7357 2018-08-23 12:04:14 Acid + oil = bye bye talaga lipstick. I was actually surprised nung nakita ko after effects hahaha it also explains the powdery finish she was saying = there was a chemical reaction.

7359 2018-08-23 12:03:58 I’d be surprised, but IMO that’s redundant.  Once oil is settled in CNY, China can use that to control oil flows &/or as another level to manage CNY/USD x-rates.
7360 2018-08-23 12:03:55 Hopefully the Venezuelans can see through this illusion. In addition to the FARC, the Muslim Brotherhood and the Jihadists also play a role.
Via the port the stolen oil is shipped, which is meant for ISIS. The Rothschilds hope to finance the RV with the illegal oil deals.

7365 2018-08-23 12:03:21 Have seen this happening when we were in schools.. late 90s to early 2000s.. eminent Prof. BM Hegde himself suggested that Coconut oil was unhealthy, 15 yrs later, it became healthy, now again healthy! My grandfather 90, grandma 1 till 88, grandma 2 till 92.. all had coconut oil!
7366 2018-08-23 12:03:13 No, it's really simple though.  I take frozen riced cauliflower, roast it for about 20 minutes, then drizzle it with extra virgin olive oil and season to taste.  I also add frozen mixed vegetables and stir.  I roast it until there's a bit of a char, but you don't have to.

7373 2018-08-23 12:02:39 What you wrote about our role in finding a solution being small is true if you only count what we burn. But 1/3 of global fuel reserves are in Alberta. Stopping the export of all that oil is the whole game on climate. Can’t do it with another pipeline.

7390 2018-08-23 12:01:01 I know where she's coming from. In the West people consume too much coconut oil as it is a 'superfood'. Calling it poison is too much though. Anything is fine in moderation. Having things like Bulletproof coffee with loads of coc oil & butter for ex is not good.

7393 2018-08-23 12:00:34 All this about coconut oil- Just read the nutritional information on the packaging and it's not rocket science to work out it's seriously high in saturated fats (bad fats) so therefore it's bad for you!

7398 2018-08-23 12:00:07 Oil Pit for earwigs
Use equal parts soy sauce and olive/vegetable oil, in a small plastic container, secure the lid. Punch holes large enough for earwigs to fit near the lid, bury just up to the holes. Soy sauce attracts earwigs, and oil prevents them from escaping.

7410 2018-08-23 11:59:07 #GrowingUpIWanted my family to be like the 1970s daytime commercials. Grandmother dropping in to give advice on laundry, dish soap, vegetable oil, and the like. I had a grandmother in Mexico and one in Arkansas (I was in Missouri), so I saw them once a year or so.
7411 2018-08-23 11:59:02 People have no idea the amount of oil pumped onto tankers in the North Sea! From platforms & FPSO installations. It’s millions of barrels, and it happens all over. I have personally been involved in this operation, sometimes close to 400,000 barrels pumped in a single operation.

7419 2018-08-23 11:58:07 Million of people in tropical countries are using it for thousands of years have not seen anyone dropping dead after consuming coconut oil. What happens in the lab is different from what happens inside the human gut.
7420 2018-08-23 11:57:51 Half of Indians would have been dead and keep dying.
It’s all nonsense findings of the research and better all Indian must consume coconut oil instead of rotten cheap oils like cotton seeds, palm, and what not that used to be consumed by buffaloes like pet animals in form of cake

7425 2018-08-23 11:57:06 TJ max sells essential oils by the check out line. But Young Living is a really good company for essentials. You can order those online! For every drop of the Lavender you should do ten of baby or coconut oil to dilute it
7426 2018-08-23 11:57:06 Find your place my friend.  
Its not your fault the price of oil came down.  

Adjust Tesla's current business model for lower oil.

7532 2018-08-23 11:44:49 I was changing oil on another auger in full view of the truck. Only the cone left in the bin, so what if the truck is a little off centre? It’ll never come close to filling the truck.

7533 2018-08-23 11:44:48 It all started when a group in OPEC wanted to move sales from $ to € Venezuela being one. Which would have screwed the USA debt as their deficit is held up by oil trading in $ per barrel. Then they went for Chavez. USA always bring down governments when oil revenue threatened.
7534 2018-08-23 11:44:45 The US, the fake democracy if there ever was one, teamed up with Turkey to train, arm and send terrorists into Syria. The US watched with approval as ISIS spread across Syria in 2013-14. Erdogan even bought oil from them. Hopefully Turkey commits fully to the anti-US resistance

The oil embargo has not gone beyond a threat. These sanctions started with Obama. The idea has been to avoid a new Cuba.

7594 2018-08-23 11:36:32 As an aside, what data is available on Malayalees, heart disease and coconut oil?
7595 2018-08-23 11:36:10 Obviously other vegetable oil alternatives has greater impact on environment because they have productivity compared to palmoil and requires more land for cultivation.
7596 2018-08-23 11:35:58 GERS allocates “oil revenues” based on geographical location. It is at least possible that figure would have some kind of impact. But even if it doesn’t that simply highlights the uselessness of the GERS exercise. Every year BILLIONS in corrections to precious years are noted.

Tory UK won’t give up Crown Estates, Trident, NATO, Oil, Gas, Water, Power or even Whisky just because a majority of Scotland’s 5 million  say so. Unfortunately.

7611 2018-08-23 11:34:19 We were back up into the prem before oil money and back down and back up and had been consistently in the prem for around 6 years before oil money came in.
7612 2018-08-23 11:34:04 That's incomplete. The "sanctions" on PDVSA are product of 10 years of litigation between the Venezuelan government and foreign oil companies. The individuals sanctioned are mostly due to money laundering and drug trafficking

7617 2018-08-23 11:33:04 The major problem with so many Nigerians, especially in the north, is that we so much listen to world news without being critical or making sense of global events.

I am not trying to object here but just looking at facts, I feel it may not be right. Also, the only reason provided by the Harvard ‘prof’ was saturated fat which is lame I think.
7621 2018-08-23 11:32:19 Saudi doesn't want to open their books w US IPO because the reserves are not there, & the world would learn that 90% of their oil comes from 6 fields that are older than dirt.

So 37BN of scots oil is whisked away and does not show in scotlands account.
If GERS is above board and true then show scots the books to prove it.

7670 2018-08-23 11:26:47 Fine, then! Vegetable oil and egg yolks whipped into a frenzy it is for you! God, you PTI lot NEVER cease to amaze!!!!!
7671 2018-08-23 11:26:34 Standards are there for a reason. They protect us against the stupidity and unscrupulousness of others. There’s a reason why we haven’t had cooking oil or baby milk death scandals here.
7672 2018-08-23 11:26:33 I am so very sad for her family.  It was a "rape" culture crime, address that issue.  OR -- are you going to address a whit e man than killed his two daughter and hid them in a oil drum, then killed his pregnant wife.  Should we tag white men as dangerous, too?
7673 2018-08-23 11:26:19 Brewers yeast tablets and a spoonful of cod liver oil!

7676 2018-08-23 11:26:05 OIL trucking from Turkana to Mombasa resumes after residents gave it a go ahead, following meetings with local leaders including CS John Munyes.
7677 2018-08-23 11:25:46 Dude same!!! And with @VanessaMorgan as well. I feel like they would be chill asf!!! Drink tea and have an essential oil defuser on. 
7678 2018-08-23 11:25:28 Bob Mueller is an American Hero.   You are a snake oil salesman and a charlatan....
7679 2018-08-23 11:25:21 @wintergatan When you make your olive oil, I'd love to see you test oiling the red 'glue layer' of the ply - just to see how much the oil brings out the colour of the glue/timber. I think it will be amazing, but would love to see if I'm right!!!
7680 2018-08-23 11:25:21 I WAS ABOUT TO SAY "BODY OIL"  ANO BA
7681 2018-08-23 11:25:16 And no im not checking all that diff shit on my car if my dad not around and im single those things will be checked when I go get my scheduled oil change....y’all men annoying
7682 2018-08-23 11:25:11 If we can continue with this and somehow manage the oil situation, falling ₹ could be a jackpot
7683 2018-08-23 11:25:07 Just so the ppl coming up with studies that coconut oil is "pure poison"...well my whole soul is poisoned then
7684 2018-08-23 11:24:32 しょ見たよって言われたときの反応が完全にこれ
7685 2018-08-23 11:24:32 Exactly. They are pushing olive oil big time.
7686 2018-08-23 11:24:14 Scientists univ of Surrey:Adjustment to ur car's ventilation system while sitting in traffic jams can greatly affect ur exposure to toxic fumes by up to 76%, windows wer closed but d fan are on, the exposure usually high .
Can we stop importing oil /petroleum ?
#Reopensterlite
7687 2018-08-23 11:24:10 I’m proud to report that between rain and hail storms yesterday I was able to get the oil changed on my truck! I didn’t have to do it before my trip to #DenFur but clean oil never hurt an engine :P

Unfortunately the large hail broke both of the plastic window rain guards.
7688 2018-08-23 11:24:09 A couple of weeks ago, I did an exercise class with @karen_hauer & a dance class with @JManrara within a couple of hours. THAT pic looks like an oil painting in comparison to the bedraggled mess that I was afterwards !!!

btw beda lo

7690 2018-08-23 11:23:27 I pakai senka UV milk. love the matte finish and blur effect. but it kind of irritated and dried my skin, even pakai 3 jenis moisturiser (oil in water, lotion n face oil), tengah hari start rasa kering2. padahal muka jenis bminyak.

syg betul sbb yg ni I paling suka finish dia.
7691 2018-08-23 11:23:25 Better to use when u heat as takes much higher heat to melt to trans fat (thus solid at room temp). But generally I agree. All oil bad news
7692 2018-08-23 11:23:18 Yep. Tried to send a couple of stories about how bad coconut oil is for us.
7693 2018-08-23 11:23:06 RT young_pfy5811 "Oil_Guns_Merica LangDixon1991 Because they don't have nearly as much oil in reserve as they claim. Its a scam and everyone knows it."
7694 2018-08-23 11:23:05 Yes blah blah,,the bootom line here is after indy scots will have100% of oil and gas revenues so there will be no BARNET and no chance for westminster to cheat us.
The oil from unkown source is a con and you know it.
7695 2018-08-23 11:23:00 US stock futures are flat with Europe flat and Asia mixed.  Oil is $67.96 with gold at $1,197.  Mostly a flat day it seems.
7696 2018-08-23 11:22:58 I shoulda drove this morning so i can go get a oil change after work 
7697 2018-08-23 11:22:58 Rt.. that’s y people in south India have been dying in millions. Next report ... some us based vegetable oil is nectar...!
7698 2018-08-23 11:22:54 Olive oil is a great food oil and cooking medium. Almost as good as mustard oil. Way more expensive though.
7699 2018-08-23 11:22:48 Note for 3, that’s not the revenues or the tax paid, but the profits earned by the companies on the oil sold, including that sent to “other regions”. Then we can see how poorly the UK government’s tax regime serves Scotland with large profits not being taxed.
7700 2018-08-23 11:22:46 Give them piped water as you fetch their oil

7710 2018-08-23 11:21:17 This year’s People’s Choice award goes to Tyler Munson for his “Blue Nude” oil painting. You still have time to view this amazing show!!!  Thursday, Aug 30, 2018 is the last day.
7711 2018-08-23 11:21:10 I would want to see;
1. A full breakdown of all monies spent “on our behalf”. What was it spent on & where, what steps were taken to ensure costs are minimised.
2. A full analysis of the Welfare spending. How many people does that cover at what rate.
3. A statement of oil profits
7712 2018-08-23 11:21:08 You are mixing two different things, oil is used as fuel for vehicles in Germany, coal is used for electricity production and it is decreasing as renewable sources are growing.
7713 2018-08-23 11:21:03 People voted NO in 2014,so Scotland could remain in the EU. So oil bad for 5.5 million, but good for 63 million, because it pays the trillions of pounds of debt Tory have racked up.Oil gives the UK it's credit rating, and bolsters the GBP. 
Mundell and the BBC which lies the most
7714 2018-08-23 11:20:42 I wonder how they made corn oil. Corn is not oily at all.  Maybe I'm missing something.

7716 2018-08-23 11:20:22 Coconut oil is a dietary staple of many cultures... people use it to cook, not like they out here scoopin it like ice cream lol
7717 2018-08-23 11:20:19 And they can't even blame their incompetence on oil prices now which have shot up over the last 12 months.

7721 2018-08-23 11:19:54 Can't even imagine any of the Trump Crime Family going to the pokey.  Bush/Cheney lied us into war for oil, and where are they today?  Enjoying their retirement on our tax $$$. We treat presidential families with kid gloves, no matter what they do. Hope it's different this time.

7727 2018-08-23 11:19:06 Is canola oil good then....   animals won't eat canola flowers from which pesticides are produced. Stupid professors brain is pure poison. Now presstitude media will recommend noble prize for the professor.

7734 2018-08-23 11:18:05 My hair looks thicker, darker and less frizzy when I apply a generous amount of virgin coconut oil and let it soak for around 30mins. VCO also heals the dry itchy patches on my arms and legs that lotion can't. It works for me I guess.

7740 2018-08-23 11:17:27 Ok, I'll explain this again. YOU ARE CONFUSING 2 DIFFERENT SETS OF STATS PRODUCED BY 2 DIFFERENT BODIES. The HMRC Export data has NOTHING TO DO WITH GERS. All UK oil receipts are allocated geographically in GERS. It wouldn't matter if the HMRC stats allocated ZERO to Scotland.
7741 2018-08-23 11:17:10 1/2 Oil markets are manipulated and run by a known and accepted cartel. We have hundreds of Oil ETFs. The problem with Bitcoin vs Oil is that the speculation vs. usage levels are skewed too much in favour of speculation.
7742 2018-08-23 11:17:07 Olive oil too
7743 2018-08-23 11:17:05 Coconut oil IS one of the healthiest oils. It has lauric acid, an amino acid present in breast milk. It boosts immunity.
7744 2018-08-23 11:16:41 BUT SOME FELLOWS ARE TELLING DAILY DRINK GLASS OR HALF GLASS COCONUT OIL TO BE IN GOOD HEALTH
7745 2018-08-23 11:16:14 Yes yes....please export more of your rice bran, canola oil. No wonder my grandmother died in her early nineties!
7746 2018-08-23 11:16:13 Sad you think that Mel.
Westminster has taken 92% of scots oil for 40+ years and still near bankrupted the UK.
Scotland is VERY resource rich,,how can we need bailed out by the resource poor country next door?
Can you explain that?

7750 2018-08-23 11:15:37 That wasn't the question which was "what to do with plastic waste". In case you haven't noticed there are millions of tons of it lying about causing immense environmental damage. Leaving oil in the ground helps not a jot.
7751 2018-08-23 11:15:21 Yes. If it’s awash with oil and not technically challenging why aren’t the oil companies there already? Their not even running seismic let alone appraisal drilling.

7757 2018-08-23 11:14:55 below 2 Trln$ everyone would dream to buy Aramco...... weed or without..... the valuation of 250bn oil reseves plus the whole value chain worth well above that level
7758 2018-08-23 11:14:53 The Americans also stack Mustard Oil as poison. 

However, that's our failure too.

We haven't been able to research enough & test & analyse the constituents of these oils. 

We need to prove that these oils are no worse than olive oil or canola oil etc.
7759 2018-08-23 11:14:44 boxes of Q-tips change your car's oil; needles change your car's oil; therefore needles are boxes of Q-tips

7767 2018-08-23 11:13:12 My best guess): its *refined* carbs + "vegetable"oil. I lived at the dutch boder and observed that dutch Kids are growing way higher than Germans and Dutch consume significant higher processed/refined Carbs + VegOil. Go visit a dutch Supermarket.....

7769 2018-08-23 11:12:56 So leave them alone with their oil and culture. Ask Trump to leave that region and take care of gun control her in the US since it is killing way more Americans than terrorism. 99% of Muslims don’t want problem with anyone. Stop invading their country for made up reasons.

7774 2018-08-23 11:12:08 If we’re using his batshit tweets as a barometer for his breaking point and the likelihood of more indictments, then Mueller will have struck oil when Trump quotes one of his own tweets.

7779 2018-08-23 11:11:01 It's mandatory. 

President Trump must impose a 35% remittance tax to all US remittances going to Mexico. Mexican economy first source of income are US remittances above oil, mining, agriculture...Mexico as a country can't survive without US remittances.......

7807 2018-08-23 11:07:25 I spoke to someone this morning - they promised to get back to me. Nothing has come of it. This is a serious matter for me. I do not know what sandton auto has done to my car, they have been dishonest where they told me they did an oil change and they didn't do it.
7808 2018-08-23 11:07:20 Engine's good. This kitty will purr 'till it needs an oil change.

The oil from north sea which goes straight onto tankers for export does not count in GERS as it does not come ashore.
So 37BILLION of scots oil is not counted as scottish.
If unionists were in gov in scotland they would be ripped off by 37BN just the same
7851 2018-08-23 11:01:30 Coconut oil isn't poison and there are many studies to prove so. It's better than seed oils.
7852 2018-08-23 11:01:21 Just like Coconut Oil = Poison

7854 2018-08-23 11:00:49 Mercedes is US, I thought theirs is burning fords. We cannot allow bullying, even apartheid gov didn't want to be bullied that's why we hv oil generated from coal by sasol, it was done to avoid bullying. It might be time for African car.
7855 2018-08-23 11:00:48 Sources for #GERS public sector revenue (excluding oil) work out at roughly 9 UK governmental departments sources for 1 Scottish source used. Why would we trust that?

Break this hellish union, it's time we were free from these lies
7856 2018-08-23 11:00:44 Sadly only 20% (!) of Palm Oil is #RSPO certified. Which means most of manufacturers are telling their own "truth" about sustainability... @GreenpeaceEU @WWF #Nutella #Ferrero "#biodiesel" :how on earth can it be #sustainable?
7857 2018-08-23 11:00:42 A good scientist can talk for 24 hours on the ill effects of Coconut oil, the next 24 hours on the ill effects of Lard and the next 24 hours on the ill effects of Olive oil. Enough data available on everything - a good marketing person will use it to suit the product he's selling
7858 2018-08-23 11:00:36 I thought it was 'oil is just a bonus on top' not 'oil reduced our annual deficit from £15bn to £14bn'

7869 2018-08-23 10:59:52 It will come to an end because you have resources.  Venezuela has a year round growing season and one of the biggest gas/oil reserves but the people are starving.  Do you really think you are getting land? The government will own all land and only elites will get farms lik Zim.
7870 2018-08-23 10:59:50 The Operators have been lenient and too diplomatic to have worked for over 8 months without medical cover! Oil and gas involves risky operations and being without a medical cover and poor motivation. This is slavery! Let's not wait for another blockade. @johnmunyes63

7873 2018-08-23 10:59:32 Like our land which benefits a shockingly small number of greedy bastards, it's time the oil industry was reorganised.  Bring in Statoil to shake things up with a view to some tasteful nationalisation of the industry. See what that'll do to their feckin GERS scam!

7893 2018-08-23 10:56:53 Correct the fourth one as the substitute contains coconut oil, the classic example is tooth paste contains now salt and charcoal after ridiculing us almost a century for using salt and charcoal
7894 2018-08-23 10:56:48 no ofc not- that's my point- there is no ecological sound way to consume (vegetable oil) in the way we do
7895 2018-08-23 10:56:47 Such a way with words! Wonder if you felt the same uprising towards the man who killed his pregnant wife & put his daughters in oil tanks?

More oil is extracted from Scottish waters than from Norway's yet Norway gets 10 times more revenue for their oil? Creative accounting by Westminster to say the least.
7924 2018-08-23 10:52:33 The homepathic quality and health benefits to man and mamal of using coconut oil in sensible quantities far outweigh this scare story. The fact that many nations use large quantities without cholesterol issues also show as part of s balanced life, most things won't kill you.

7935 2018-08-23 10:50:52 Agreed. As the POTUS (hate giving him that title), he allowed an oil company to drill through a reservation that could impact their water supply. I don’t recall the protesting Native Americans saying it was ok to take their land ...and it was deemed ok with military back up!

8071 2018-08-23 10:33:42 For centuries, Indian mothers have used this 'poison' as massage oil for their new born babies. And it is also used as cooking oil in parts of India. But never heard of any harm due to it's use. So Indians are immune to this 'poison' and will keep using it.

8077 2018-08-23 10:33:03 Recently on Turkey trip, I realised that young women there have a new craze with coconut oil - not for cooking, but for hair. 

They believe Indian women have dark, thick hair becoz they use coconut oil 
8078 2018-08-23 10:32:52 Harvard was always bullshit and senseless. Hahahhahaha coconut oil is poison what an idiot @Harvard @cnnbrk @BBCWorld
8079 2018-08-23 10:32:48 In recent times virgin coconut oil sale has increased around world , it takes the place of top ten items which are going to have high demand in the market as per a marketing survey. It looks the professor is working for some agency to bring down the demand of coconut oil.

8084 2018-08-23 10:32:04 My Canadian estimate based on driving expenses for a Mazda 6 for 7 years. Oil, maintenance, service, $25,000. Tesla Model 3 is ~$9000. At the end of that 7 years the battery will have at least 90% range, ususally more. Distance covered will be ~ 200,000km
8085 2018-08-23 10:31:38  Watching it I can’t help but think a) coconut oils success must affect her financially and b) that some coconut oil on her mush would probably do her wonders! Coconut milk is delicious by the way. Going back for more later

8108 2018-08-23 10:27:59 I work in the oil game, it’s been a bloodbath since 2014, jobs cut, budgets slashed, rotas changed, survival mode. Got to let it recover a bit before the next tax grab. All that said, any small country with a million barrel a day oil industry has a great asset.

8111 2018-08-23 10:27:34 I remember I used to have to go to war with Mr Snelling about not cutting my hair, meanwhile certain demographics were coming in with more oil in their hair than an oil spill 
8112 2018-08-23 10:27:30 ...And 70% of Venezuela is private sector, but also oil prices fell and the US has starved the country through sanctions. So why are you in my mentions?
8113 2018-08-23 10:27:23 ask yourself where we source our second hand cars..(hint Japan).. also ask your self if crude oil has any other purpose apart from fueling vehicles (hint, production of electricity, plastic, tar, powering heavy machinery etc).
8114 2018-08-23 10:27:10 Hey @Rubywax we’d love to have you involved in our Plastic Free Periods campaign (did you know that menstrual pads contain up to 90% crude oil plastics, & that over a lifetime disposable products can cost up to 20 X more than reusables!?) Can we email you some info? 
8115 2018-08-23 10:26:49 Real reason is its hurting their economic interests. Please ask professor, from whome did he take funds to carryout such stupid research.  Cholesterol and dietary fat myth is busted, so enjoy your daily dose of coconut oil and stay healthy.
8116 2018-08-23 10:26:43 Oh, sounds dreamy as is 
I had some roast potatoes last year from a homemade-ish takeaway joint: wedges coated in olive oil & lemon thyme, w/ a lemon wedge to squeeze over. Standard thyme would have been great, but the lemon thyme was sensational! Lots of easy wins w/ thyme/s

8118 2018-08-23 10:26:25 We hv seen hw mustard oil & ghee is replaced by refined oil , Now they are attaching coconut oil. reason
1. Need of coconut in cosmetic cream

3. Promote private companies synthetic oils

8130 2018-08-23 10:24:23 Coconut oil contains some nutritional compounds that are absent from other fats.   You don't need much of these compounds and you can get them from other places.

8167 2018-08-23 10:19:32 Don't take into account John Bolton's threat, the middle east Region is fortunately the main oil producer of the Globe. Trump's Administration won't be able to implement sanctions on Iraq and Iran without Provoking an hyper inflation of oil Price.

Westminster gives Scotland back 8% of what is rightfully near 100% Scottish , called geographical share.

Were the maths done right , then Scotland would only be sending Westminster 8% , not 92% instead , as geographical share.

I cant believe Scots havent twigged.

8202 2018-08-23 10:14:33 @TuckerGoodrich so I read soy oil should be avoided b/c it's high in omega-6. What about soy sauce instead? Very relevant for me, as I am asian :)
8203 2018-08-23 10:14:17 my sister wants me to drink castor oil to induce my pregnancy once she gets here. has anyone done it & are there any negative affects?
8204 2018-08-23 10:13:59 Looks like you are digging for oil. That's a deep hole!

8207 2018-08-23 10:13:28 To be fair Africa was probably the richest continent in the world with natural resources or gold lithium diamonds oil etc and while I don't condone the murders I can see why they are angry after their country has been raped of natural resources by colonial regimes for years

8209 2018-08-23 10:13:00 Mahathir said the wrong things offended the Chinese. Mahathir said : free trade should also be fair trade  and being in debt is a new form of colonisation. 
Now you don't expect China to import your durians, palm oil etc... Mahathir made a big mistake.
8210 2018-08-23 10:12:44 no, it's actually good... it's not all about smoking.
the oil from some varieties have cured loads of ailments, including some types of Cancer, etc... aside that, it has different uses.

8212 2018-08-23 10:12:14 Zeit zaytoun has a low emoke point. So vegetable oil is better to fry/cook with. Olive oil tastes good on everything else though. Legit, Inonce had a vanilla and olive macaron and it was the best thing I have ever eaten

8227 2018-08-23 10:09:53 But the industrial base was allowed to wither in the years of high oil prices. Then not enough money diverted to investment, just social programmes. It's a problem with state control. Governments tend to be not very clever, but have taken away the other decision making mechanisms
8228 2018-08-23 10:09:50 And dumped those poor babies in barrels of old oil...

8239 2018-08-23 10:07:44 no - in the 80s “Scotland’s oil” made us a massive contributor to the UK economy - I believe in pooling and sharing both ways round

that’s also why I’m pro Remain despite us being net fiscal contributors to the EU - are you pro or anti EU membership?

8252 2018-08-23 10:04:31 Could it be that diverting oil revenues away from investment in the industry towards social programmes has created an inevitable decline in production and hence in exports? BTW your link just goes to a general Independent site and not to the Venezuela article.

8257 2018-08-23 10:04:07 Utter nonsense. People in India have been using it for centuries with no health issues. This is the only oil that can be digested by infants.
8258 2018-08-23 10:04:02 Touché PDP had the luxury at a time of plenty with oil revenue maxing out and tipping all the statistical scales ,but in their typical fashion, settled for less without establishing a functioning health care system. Now in a time of low oil revenue, they are demanding magic .
8259 2018-08-23 10:03:59 I’d nominate Midnight Oil’s “Forgotten Years” for the same reason.
8260 2018-08-23 10:03:54 They are practically a trust when it comes to agreeing on a price per barrel of oil. Thats not good at all.

8270 2018-08-23 10:02:31 Butter isn't evil either! Butter/coconut oil/olive oil are much better for you than 'low fat' spreads and plant oils. If you use a whole slab of butter to cook, then yea - not great

8286 2018-08-23 09:59:22 The macro variables & recent swing in oil prices point towards increase in inflationary outlook in Sri Lanka. We have seen a dip in foreign direct investments & outflow from foreign investors. So liquidity in the system is in short supply on the back of currency outflow

be realistic you can't boycott any foreign product or company if u dont do the same..

This professor is just sharing her opinion, not facts, but due to her position, it has been mis-interpreted as fact
8295 2018-08-23 09:58:19 I tried a diet based on coconut oil. After 9 months my previously normal cholesterol level and BP were through the roof and the GP said I was heading rapidly for a heart attack. Cut out the oil and it’s gradually gone back to normal. Am on BP tabs for ever now though. Quack diet
8296 2018-08-23 09:58:14 Having produced more oil and gas than Kuwait, Scotland should be up there with Norway. Wonder what went wrong.

8310 2018-08-23 09:56:04 Another thing A nation that illegally invaded countries like Iraq to grab oil, and still has land Reservations for indigenous Americans, is not morally qualified to interfere in SA and our domestic  land issue. Rather sort out your own serious challenges first.

But suddenly consuming coconut oil has clinically shown to increase bad lipids, as seen in blood reports. I’m quoting that data.
8330 2018-08-23 09:53:21 But I observed that, food prepared by using coconut oil n consumed has not reduced the life span since long, as edible oil consumers.
8331 2018-08-23 09:52:59 Falsifying destinations and switching off AIS is not allowed. The latter in particular can cause a collision (as we've seen before) and end up in an environmental disaster; oil spill.

By re-establishing the use of industrial hemp for fibre, oil and other products plus cow-dung or horse-stable based gas production for local alternative fuel availability.
Vegans may have objections, but we don't mean factory farms.
These are only two examples.

8365 2018-08-23 09:48:18 Untrue... You are basing that on the GERS report presumably. Which is based on Scotland as part of UK. Full of holes e.g. £37 billion of oil revenue is attributed to UK rather than Scotland. In an Independent Scotland it would be attributed to Scotland.

8473 2018-08-23 09:34:48 So to sum up,you are stupid enough to believe those who take 92% of scots oil revenues when they say scots cant afford indy?

8474 2018-08-23 09:34:48 I do veg bowls all the time. Usually lightly fry a can of chickpeas in coconut oil with paprika, cayenne pepper and garlic and add those in with roast veg to fill myself up more. It’s also a meal that keeps well for leftovers.

8479 2018-08-23 09:33:53 Part of the problem with farmers not being able to get their crop to market is because the railways are clogged with oil shipments because there's no pipeline.  Pipeline would actually solve a lot more problems than people realize.
8480 2018-08-23 09:33:53 Jesus this is getting annoying. I worked in the oil industry for 6y I KNOW THIS. What I want you to do is to give me concrete examples of what you are claimining "paramilitar forces paid by the US forcing human displacements IN VENEZUELA". Show me that! Is my english not clear?
8481 2018-08-23 09:33:49 @MadMoneyOnCNBC @jimcramer Jim, why on earth would Saudi Aramco halt their IPO, advertised as largest in IPO history, when oil prices are reasonably high, & the name of game is to maximize IPO sales revenue?
8482 2018-08-23 09:33:49 I should have added @DavidMundellDCT give it up your a liar.  The oil is a bonus and it's not running out any time soon . you don't work for the people of Scotland, you work for Westminster. #DissolveTheUnion

8488 2018-08-23 09:32:47 So your case for union is scots get a free handout and we will lose it if we are indy.

8510 2018-08-23 09:30:24 Also most of the soy that is produced in the world is specifically for feeding cattle. Most vegans try and avoid the consumption of palm oil. WE should all be looking at ways to ethically consume products instead of pointing fingers at vegans because it’s hot to hate us.

8548 2018-08-23 09:24:11 Valid point sir. The advent of Olive oil as a healthier substitute has a PR exercise written all over it. Do they mean that mustard oil or coconut oil all are poison but 'holier than thou' Olive oil?
8549 2018-08-23 09:24:09 All you need to do is define the term "Poison".
Once they do ask them "How many People died out of the poison called Coconut Oil".
If they don't give statistics ,accept it as just another Stanford University kind of research which predicted Hillary to be President of USA.

8580 2018-08-23 09:20:59 Actually, Coconut oil is one of the better oils to use for frying due to the high levels of saturated fats, which makes the oil more resistant to heat. It is Olive oil that shouldnt be fried and use more as a dressing for food.

I find a safer base for a generic stir fry is onion, garlic, ginger, oyster sauce, a little soy sauce, some chicken stock, a dash of sesame oil and chili oil and finish with a little dissolved cornflour to thicken.

8611 2018-08-23 09:16:05 Palm oil has approx 30% more saturated fat than beef dripping yet is everywhere, chocolate, bread, biscuits, cakes, mixes, gravy + granules, fast foods, frozen foods, cerials, margerines, etc. People are often unwittingly consuming food combinations of more unhealthy fat/sugar.
8612 2018-08-23 09:15:58 Olive oil is rich in heart-healthy unsaturated fats.
8613 2018-08-23 09:15:48 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
8614 2018-08-23 09:15:44 Ugh it’s a bitch, I’m going through a load of tests at the moment eliminating things. I’m a bit concerned about the CBD oil, although it’s been recommended to me I do have a habit of having weird reactions to things, then again the PAIN  I feel you
8615 2018-08-23 09:15:43 With the the things deduced from here, the VP is saying lower oil revenue is not an excuse for the government not to achieve.

8618 2018-08-23 09:14:30 Both Scandie currencies found some strength yesterday seeing EURNOK and EURSEK retrace some of the recent moves higher. An inline Norwegian GDP print this morning has helped NOK find some additional strength after a better day yesterday, thanks to oil trading well.

8620 2018-08-23 09:14:00 Stop sounding stupid my man. So you came bcos of oil? So without oil you idiots won't work? Are you for real ? What is this obsession with oil. Some people were governing Nig before d discovery of oil, are you saying they are stupid. Stop all these lazy excuses and work. Rubbish

8622 2018-08-23 09:13:26 India rejects UAE's $100 million financial help for the floods in #Kerala. They have a policy of some sort. 

This, I feel is how States emerge as World Powers. Leading their nation towards self sufficiency rather than relying on Arab Oil, US $s or Chinese friendship.
8623 2018-08-23 09:13:23 It's outright propaganda you absolute ROASTER ! Nothing accurate in figures that don't accredit Scotland with the resources that come out of Scotland ie oil and gas comes under unknown region and whiskey etc isn't fully accredited to us, it's just so ridiculous like your tweet 
8624 2018-08-23 09:13:12 Do you know where on earth I first seen coconut oil used for eating/cooking? Here in America. I can only speak for where I’m from, Tonga  Coconut is the tree of life. We use every part of the plant. We use coconut oil as you would use lotion here, on our skin not for cooking
8625 2018-08-23 09:12:17 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
8626 2018-08-23 09:12:03 Singapore does not have a single drop of oil (or other natural resource) apart from her people. But its a preferred commercial hub with one of the highest per capita incomes. Venezuela, an oil rich country has citizens trooping to the borders. Its a strange world indeed.
8627 2018-08-23 09:12:01  America, who disrespects the natives rights for the land is going to tell SA, a country who's natives want land, about property rights. The same America that invaded Iraq, and ousted a prime minister for oil in IRAN. Who knew devil's could play a high moral ground
8628 2018-08-23 09:11:55 We're safe. We don't have oil.
8629 2018-08-23 09:11:49 Roommate: Lord, set me on fire. I want to burn  for you

Roommate: *screams, Jisos! (see dude )

8630 2018-08-23 09:11:30 Well we will have to be renegotiating the oil sales then. As a new country all the old deals are with London.

8640 2018-08-23 09:10:33 What utter nonsense!  These are fantasy figures - an indy Scotland for a start wouldn't have its oil revenue accounted for elsewhere, nor would we be paying for nukes or HS2; all economic activity would be included in our GDP.  Stick your union up your jacksie, Uncle Tom.
8641 2018-08-23 09:10:27 I think its not healthy to use olive oil at high temp.
8642 2018-08-23 09:10:25 How much palm oil does it contain
8643 2018-08-23 09:10:23 It would appear from a quick read that the olive, frying oil and various spices arrived with the Arabs, as well as their shared style of eating, so they do play a large role.

Tomatos though? That's all South America.

8649 2018-08-23 09:09:14 In any business, to control the expenditure we need to know how it’s allocated and distributed. With respect to Oil do you have any idea the breakdown percentages of Jordan’s consumption
8650 2018-08-23 09:08:40 « Should China also agree to buy more U.S. oil as part of a trade deal some time soon, the logic for Saudi Arabia to lock down more market share with an Aramco stake sale to China could soon become compelling again. »

8660 2018-08-23 09:06:57 @VP the Iranian regime must pay a heavy price, and the end of Iran's oil will be the heaviest blow to the regime. Everything is prepared and there is no justification, Iran's oil exports will be completely cut off on November 4th.

8662 2018-08-23 09:06:44  a fake document with fake figures that don't give us the full picture or accredit us with the full revenue that comes from Scotland, oil and gas comes under unknown region you outright liar, our exports that leave from England get accredited to gues where ??? YEAH ENGLAND
8663 2018-08-23 09:06:31 @VP All sanctions must be implemented without any exemptions, and Iran's oil exports must be completely discontinued until November 4 so that no money can be made for this criminal regime. On November 4, the day the Iranian regime invaded the US embassy

8669 2018-08-23 09:05:40 Billions of £s of oil is exported directly from the North Sea every year and doesn’t come ashore.  The UK classes this as ‘unknown origin’ instead of a Scottish export

8691 2018-08-23 09:03:12 Funny thing is I agree that coconut oil might be a little worse for us than lard because I suspect that animal fats are healthier for us than plant fats (though coconut oil is about as good as it gets in the plant fat department).
8692 2018-08-23 09:03:10 As has been mentioned - snake oil has a sell by date. Ad infinitum. The patterns are there in the designs we (re)invent. Staying relevant is practising, not (re)discovering new things endlessly, like a stateless observer watching a fireworks display
8693 2018-08-23 09:02:56 #ukog There's nothing wrong with protesting but you cannot stop a company going about its lawful business. Also stop lying about fracking and stop being so hypocritical by turning up in vehicles with signs made from oil based products.
8694 2018-08-23 09:02:54 I think fish oil was the cure for all 15 years ago as well. 

I used it 3 months, felt horrible and stopped. 

There are benefits, but nothing exaggerated. 

Fish production today is so polluted that it's unhealthy to consume anything related.

8699 2018-08-23 09:02:05 This is the recycled gimmick that was carried out for salt (as tooth cleaner), millets (as regressive farming) and ghee. My gumption is that some big patent is awaited in coconut oil. So inject this fear, gradually alienate ppl from it and later launch it again in future.

8731 2018-08-23 08:58:36 There is always some underlying lobbying behinds these studies. 
Either way, coconut oil for the win.
8732 2018-08-23 08:58:22 Sorry this Professor cannot confuse us in Africa anymore We have used coconut oil to cook for centuries ; some have lived past 90 years without visiting hospital. Some of your peers have passed the oil as better than others produced in your country so to hell with your findings

8734 2018-08-23 08:58:07 Government's seeking caste and religion-wise information of about 10 lakh workers working on the petrol pumps in the country is illegal and unconstitutional. The govt. must abandon this plan before Oil Dealers Association resort to agitation as it has threatened.

8744 2018-08-23 08:57:22 I don’t drive. 97% of all climatologists agree this is man made climate change. The 3% that don’t are paid by big oil. Where are your, non-corrupt, scientist that dispute this? A PhD in climatology or a related field an advantage. A PhD in literature doesn’t count.

8749 2018-08-23 08:56:48 @Matt_J_Drake Hi Matt, I just caught your piece on oil sanctions on the Express. Can I speak with you about some data around the Trump effect on crude oil and global trade on behalf of a client? DM or email if possible? Thank you.
8750 2018-08-23 08:56:14 After this episode, same guy decided to try and fry an egg for breakfast one morning. He couldn't find any oil or butter so he decided to use vinegar. You can imagine how that turned out. And oh my, the smell!!
8751 2018-08-23 08:56:12 We have been consuming pure coconut oil for ages and still alive.

Probably they want to support some pharma company for medicine against oil
8757 2018-08-23 08:54:51 How about mustard oil? Regions in India that historically consumed mustard (or rapeseed NOT canola) oil seemed to have higher longevity when corrected for income and education levels.

It turned out he'd been trying to fry them in water.

9003 2018-08-23 08:16:52 So if it's worthless hand all control, tax, revenue to the SG. The oil revenue scares the shit out of you people
9004 2018-08-23 08:16:47 Norway estimated earnings of $224 Billion from North Sea Oil and Gas receipts for 2017/2018. They have similar reserves of Oil to Scotland. They employ more people than our industry who earn more, and pay more taxes into the system win win for them. We subside foreign companies.
9005 2018-08-23 08:16:38 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
9006 2018-08-23 08:15:58 David Mundell says oil revenues should not be used as the basis of the argument for Scottish independence.
@DavidMundellDCT we know also does not want to include Whisky or tourism into the equation. Just look at his previous comments. 
#TRAITORMUNDELL
9007 2018-08-23 08:15:46 It’s clearly not worthless. The oil companies invest vast sums to extract it. My point is that the revenue from the sale of oil belongs to the oil companies, not the Government. The Government’s share (from Corporation Tax) last year was £1.3 billion.

9023 2018-08-23 08:14:20 no it's not it's just in your warped world it is-you've been found out to be a liar, you're not president material, your a snake oil salesman that's all you are, history will judge you, and may god have mercy on your soul.

9026 2018-08-23 08:14:09 If Coconut oil is poison why do all the Mallus look fit always. You see majority of athletes from the state of Kerala, the largest consumer of Coconut oil.

9034 2018-08-23 08:12:35 They're also selling Atlantic licences like hot cakes in US dollars. So tell the Norwegians they're oil is worthless.
9035 2018-08-23 08:12:33 A couple of things - 1. What the hell can Pompeo, Trump or the US government ACTUALLY DO if they find whatever the far right want them to? We don’t have oil, so we’re not getting invaded. #LandExpropriation #SouthAfricanfarmers #DonaldTrump
9036 2018-08-23 08:12:26 Petroleum Products:

9040 2018-08-23 08:11:29 Might be the coconut taken for research at lab was not one that is of natural species. It might be the one what scientists does in lab by changing it genetically. Indians are enjoying Indian coconut oil. But ya might be palm oil is poisonous.

9046 2018-08-23 08:11:08 Bullshit!!! Makes me wonder if the FDA( Food and drug Administration) didn't pay him to say that. Coconut oil is one of the best home remedies there is. Thank God I do my own research and don't allow the media to think for me. Foh!!!
9047 2018-08-23 08:11:02 Primarily mustard oil and ghee
9048 2018-08-23 08:11:02 Kind of ironic you say that when you lot were favorably covering Hillary Clinton, who lobbied for big oil, fossil fuels & pushing for fracking globally, as the frontrunner in 2016 rather than someone who wasn't (his name was Bernie Sanders). But I'll give you an A for trying
9049 2018-08-23 08:10:59 For making soap, oil is required. But to clean oil, soap is required. This is the irony of life. No one is self sufficient. Everybody needs somebody at any point in time. Do not despise or treat people any how. Treat others well.

9076 2018-08-23 08:08:14 Wouldn't a really smart city be one where the reliance on fossil fuels was reduced to zero in order to try and prevent climate change? This is just green washing for Shell which made £11.2 billion profits from oil in 2017.

9101 2018-08-23 08:04:51 Good point Paddy. I do know only a modest percentage of reserves are exploitable. This is why China years ago invited a lot of cos. to explore and test feasibility of shale gas/oil. Never did hear how successful that was.

All theses days they were telling lies about cholesterol, now started with coconut oil.
9110 2018-08-23 08:02:56 Harvard Professor, obviously he's not very smart despite his title. Half a million south sea islanders live on coconut products, cream, oil, milk and meat !
Cholesterol levels spot on, Triglycerides levels well within the medical norms and far less digestive disturbances !
9111 2018-08-23 08:02:55 Scotland isn't allowed to look at 'THE BOOKS' as you well know! We have NO IDEA what GUESSES have been made by WM in an effort to make figures look bad.

9112 2018-08-23 08:02:35 @patrickwintour Hi Patrick, I just caught your piece on Iranian oil exports. Can I speak with you about some data around the Trump effect on crude oil and global trade on behalf of a client? DM or email if possible? Thank you.
9113 2018-08-23 08:02:30 •Wash your face when you wake up and before you go to bed  

•Steam your face with hot water to open up your pores

•Use a tea tree oil face wash (you can get them at the body shop) to help clear up acne
9114 2018-08-23 08:02:21 But canola oil IS better?
Nope
9115 2018-08-23 08:02:17 Turmeric facial cleansing bar, Moringa oil (use as your daily facial moisturizer accompanied by SPF,at all times), Lemon brightening overnight serum (use daily at night after cleansing),Green Tea Exfoliating Scrub (use once/twice a week)and Turmeric mask(use once/twice a week)
9116 2018-08-23 08:02:15 THC oil is definitely amazing for you esp in highly concentrated form. It may to some however require some coconut oil fried goodies if that's your kick. I'll stick to a couple scoops of ice cream and fresh berries thank you

9120 2018-08-23 08:01:35 Oh yeah,I agree it's not a "miracle" fat, but in terms of sat fats, it is on a much healthier scale than others. It's like avocados,they're a fat but are SO good  Palm oil is shitty because it kills the orangutans, my heart broke the day I discovered party rings had palm oil 
9121 2018-08-23 08:01:33 Clarified butter is butter with the residual milk solids cooked out, so you’re left with pure butterfat with a high smoke point. There is no significant difference between virgin and refined coconut oil besides the higher smoke point and lack of coconut flavor in the latter.
9122 2018-08-23 08:01:29 Harvard University is one of the best in the world.... don't know why should someone write an irresponsible statement against coconut oil....bizzare ...
9123 2018-08-23 08:01:27 Last year, it was rice, now coconut oil. Like₹200 for a troll tweet, this is a troll based on research for $100000

9125 2018-08-23 08:01:17 New technologies make once difficult to exploit reserves viable (obviously more so at a higher oil price). Remember Peter Odell explaining this to me when I did Energy Forecasting for Shell in NL in 1980-1983 !  Everyone underestimates “Reserves”.

9162 2018-08-23 07:56:32 There is no good evidence that coconut oil or ghee or sunflower oil is superfood/ poison . 
Most nutrition research is shady.

But lure of marketing is high.

Most people/gurus overestimate effect of type of food while ignoring amount of calories they consume.
9163 2018-08-23 07:56:16 Yep, look at fields like Kraken, using a combination of water injection and subsea hydraulic pumps. Extracting high value heavy oil that would not have been feasible. Or injection of CO2 infused water to increase extraction.

9165 2018-08-23 07:56:08 My great grandmother is a hundred years old. She's had food cooked with coconut oil her entire life. This "pure poison" is arguably the most impotent poison to have ever existed.

9170 2018-08-23 07:55:40 This just another false propaganda which these educated illiterate want to use so in future they will say they discovered coconut oil as a medicine like they had tried in past 4 turmeric 4 which they lost drastically 2 India. They know its benefits 4m our scriptures.

9176 2018-08-23 07:54:36 1) This study correctly points out that saturated fat isn't the devil
2) That has unfortunately been distorted as 'consume lots of saturated fat' in the wider message 
3) Coconut oil raises both types of cholesterol - not just the good kind when used in large volume
9177 2018-08-23 07:54:35 Why do unionists constantly bring up the oil argument? Probably because it deflects from the fact that even without it Scotland would be a wealthy independent nation. Even Cameron in an interview with Marr let the cat out of the bag. Oil is the icing on the cake.
9178 2018-08-23 07:54:31 Huge waste of electricity. All those overfilled kettles, all those half drunk mugs. Probably a billion barrels of oil wasted by humans boiling unused water for tea over the years.

9181 2018-08-23 07:54:23 #GERS fact. If the rate of tax on North Sea oil had not been slashed by the Tories and was still at 2010 levels, it would have delivered an additional £6billion to the Scottish economy tax take.
9182 2018-08-23 07:54:08 Ooooh and guess where the GOP are heavily invested.? Coal/oil/steel.
USA had a really good and profitable nuclear industry. That is the one that should have been expanded.
9183 2018-08-23 07:54:02 But what people don’t understand is that they may as well be cooking with palm oil. It also taints the taste of all food. I haven’t read anything from the Harvard guy. This has been my view on it for years. It’s not this miracle fat that everyone believes it is.
9184 2018-08-23 07:54:02 
9185 2018-08-23 07:53:59 Butter, grapeseed oil, fresh ginger, tomato paste, chili flakes (but spices are a whole other post tbh), sherry/wine, fresh herbs
9186 2018-08-23 07:53:57 The expectations is the ripple effect of affordable oil in the market

Low carb is bad .. Then low carb is good 
Coconut oil is bad means coconut oil is good 
Soy or corn oils is good means it's bad 
Etc etc 
Why we should follow this conflicted ass... advises ?
9189 2018-08-23 07:53:26 Tobacco still exists ,along with alcohol , maruajana and others including sugar which kills more people than tobacco.
NFL still exists and so is boxing , MMA , violent video games.
Coal will Co exist , with wind , nuclear , hydro , solar . Oil will also with electric cars.

9194 2018-08-23 07:52:43 Did the oil work for you?
9195 2018-08-23 07:52:43 @iansample Even more surprisingly, while butter and olive oil both raised good HDL cholesterol by five per cent, coconut oil raised it by a staggering fifteen percent, meaning that it seemed to have a more positive effect on cholesterol related health than olive oil.

9202 2018-08-23 07:51:37 @meathcoco Oil or fuel visible on the Navan bound lane of the Slane/Navan Rd from Wickers Cross for at least 1km
9203 2018-08-23 07:51:36 So yes, it's a saturated fat but it's much better to cook with than other types of oil (with the exception of olive oil) It's not "poisonous" as that Harvard guy says, and has many health benefits. It's actually worse for your skin/hair than it is to cook with!

9210 2018-08-23 07:49:53 As I've said before, in an Indy Scotland our Oil revenue should be banked in order to invest in renewables. Our country being small enough could lead the way in renewable/free energy for the population and excess exported.

9233 2018-08-23 07:46:45 I think this stems from the fact that people don't use those other things you mentioned medicinally, and also the way Coconut oil is being pushed as the next best thing too.  I also doubt if they will have a special propaganda against coconut.

9236 2018-08-23 07:46:22 Coconut oil, clarified butter, or beef tallow are best for cooking. 

Oily fish is high in n-3 PUFA and also n-6 PUFA to a lesser extent. Although some studies purport benefits from n-3, it’s probably harmful in the quantities they were consuming.
9237 2018-08-23 07:46:11 I'll have to read the paper over a couple times but after a first read their method may not reflect the method of most extractors. My solution is distillate oil (nextleaf does this), isolates, terpenes and formulations. You can standardize that way easily if you have a chemist

9282 2018-08-23 07:38:15 I’ve read research that the saturated fats in coconut oil aren’t as harmful as other saturated fats, but as the article states there’s not enough research out there. Everything in moderation.

9301 2018-08-23 07:36:03 Funny how every other nation with oil gets rich, but Scotland under Westminster doesn't. It's almost as if Westminster is working against us, isn't it?

It's funny how you see this and advocate staying under Westminster rule. It's almost as if you're working against us, isn't it?

9305 2018-08-23 07:35:43 Totally correct along time ago. The wrong message on oil in 2014, was one of my main reasons for not voting Yes. I wanted to see more imagination regarding a more mixed and future safe industrial/economic policy. There is some better work going on and the oil slump helped in that
9306 2018-08-23 07:35:26 If over a third of the experts can't agree about what the facts are, that's a strong indication that there are legitimate counterarguments. Which suggests that there is probably data contradicting the notion that coconut oil is poison.
9307 2018-08-23 07:35:25 Genuine question: how do you know the BHF is owned by seed oil companies? Is there evidence online? Grateful for links if you have any. Thanks

9320 2018-08-23 07:33:27 We witness a huge decline for four to five consecutive quarters, we rely solely on crude oil. So coming out of those disastrous period, it will take time for our economy to bounce back. Economy growth don't works like a switch that you on and off.

They will have no honor Or Glory & will answer for their crimes of hate, murder, corruption & destruction
9392 2018-08-23 07:25:41 In May began the first 90-day notice period so everyone can start looking for alternative sources of oil. As of August began the 90-day wind-down period; reduction of imports. As of November 5th, the sanctions come into full effect.

No, noo!
9422 2018-08-23 07:21:07 no it doesn’t - the black line shows that (even with “our oil”) we generate less revenue per capita now - and only when the black line was above the red did we generate relatively more per capita revenue than we receive in spending

9423 2018-08-23 07:21:04 if the bible has taught us nothing else, and it hasn’t, it’s that girls should stick to girl sports such as hot oil wrestling, foxy boxing, and such and such.
9424 2018-08-23 07:20:49 I suspect the growing Oil prices to $75 from when the idea was first mooted has reduced the pressure for the need to have the IPO done immediately plus they did recover a lot from the locked-up Oil Sheikhs - well, let's see how soon they will come back to this.

9488 2018-08-23 07:10:11 I do really accept that Coconut is poisonous, but only when it perishes. Coconut Oil has lot of medi-clinical effects when it gets heated with camphor. Like Sun-Tan, bathing in coconut oil soothes & replenishes the body parts. Lukewarm c. oil can be rubbed against scars & bruises

9490 2018-08-23 07:10:04 The value of the oil extracted from the NS is irrelevant to Scotland’s public expenditure deficit. What’s important is the tax which the oil companies pay to the Govt. Last year it was £1.3 billion. If the Govt wanted all the oil revenue, it would have to nationalise BP & Shell!

leave a last few feet for wall street and think
a lot of medical and economic data shared.
9496 2018-08-23 07:08:48 Maybe. But it's more likely they believe oil is headed to $100+ and they can float their IPO at a much higher price. We'd be talking about an extra trillion or so.

9524 2018-08-23 07:05:17 @iansample The Harvard professor arguing that coconut oil is 'poison' must be being paid by the canola oil industry or similar. Her argument is wrong. I don't think it's helpful to write that story up in the way you have, with refs to Paltrow and the like.

None of those oils can be used for cooking.  Canola oil is partially hydrogenated(very bad for u)

9564 2018-08-23 06:58:25 Hear we go again the oil scare, what doesn’t stack up is WM accounting. 
9565 2018-08-23 06:58:19 you know that this time is their fans sensitive time.. why you still adding oil in it. it doesn’t makes you a better fan.. and you wrote in your own language ... lucky thing is they don’t understand. JUST PUT THEM IN YOUR SHOES AND THINK
9566 2018-08-23 06:58:17 Sunday Riley, why you so esspensive? 

I tried a sample of your Good Genes & I’m in love. It really works, but I cannot allow myself to spend $105 on you. No. Nope. No no no. I already bought the Luna Sleeping Oil. Only one splurge item per year. 
9567 2018-08-23 06:58:16 Since when did the Independent become a mouthpiece for the American Corn Oil industry? We all know the British are essentially, POODLES of the Americans but this is taking it a bit too far, you Poms!!

9569 2018-08-23 06:57:44 Wait till they send an alternate oil to india nicely packed and presented by Beautiful item girls in advertisements which will be hammered down on us. And people will blindly start buying the same....Idiots...Like they do now.
9570 2018-08-23 06:57:42 Oil we send abroad is worth 37 billion and not in GERS figures. You should know that or you should give up politics.

9582 2018-08-23 06:56:18 Nigeria through the genius of NOI had ECA and other buffers to take care of periods of low oil prices. It was not oil prices going down that plunged Nigeria into recession. It was PMB failing to have a cabinet for 6 straight months that did. That’s the fact! Stop defending evil
9583 2018-08-23 06:56:16 News: ''Saudi Arabia denied that it had called off an initial public offering of state oil company Aramco, according to a CNBC report Wednesday night, but suggested that plans may be on hold'' @MarketWatch

9588 2018-08-23 06:55:41 We'd get off oil asap if helping them was the goal. Stop buying and fuck right off and let the bad ideas naturally select out.

9590 2018-08-23 06:55:27 So which oil does the western world wants to export to India?
9591 2018-08-23 06:54:58 I read the news of an organization leader who was established in 3 days by the countries that govern the world arms market. It is an established organization to steal oil from Islamic countries. If you remember, September 11 attacked Cia's former agent, Ladin.
9592 2018-08-23 06:54:49 Must have received a hefty grant for concocting a research paper from done shady company.   Earlier also they came out against coconut oil to push their filthy stinking  palm oil.

9596 2018-08-23 06:54:19 isn't it from November which the USA asking some countries to buy zero oil from Iran or also?
9597 2018-08-23 06:54:09 What would the effect on this “deficit” be of the billions from Scottish oil the UK hides away in @unknown region” for the sole purpose of pretending Scotland is poor?
9598 2018-08-23 06:53:57 I'll be there :) and I did rice noodles with fried tofu, sautéed snap peas, broccoli, carrots, green onions, sesame seeds and a sauce made from ginger, purple garlic from the garden, soy sauce, chili sesame oil, and pepper. It was super bomb and relatively healthy
9599 2018-08-23 06:53:56 Let's be honest, we are the only country ever to find oil and get poorer...oil prices went up and we got poorer...Banana Land...
9600 2018-08-23 06:53:55 LOL if housing isn't a commodity then I guess oil is a human right too. Those who can't afford oil should be given government subsidized loans to allow them access to oil and those who own oil and decide to 'hoard' it will need to be fined
9601 2018-08-23 06:53:50 i did it with olive oil
9602 2018-08-23 06:53:44 Really? Because YOUR Big Oil Champ of a PRESIDENT just rallied / campaigned on coal last night to about 4 thousand West Virginians and bragged about thousands of coal jobs he's brought back to the state. So what were you saying?
9603 2018-08-23 06:53:36 There has been locally based, small-scale sustainable palm oil production for a long time. But definitely, using it on an industrial scale to fulfill junk food cravings and make cheap fuel is reckless.

1. Norway oil funded wealth fund made more money last year than the ENTIRE SCOTTISH GOVT BUDGET
2. Norway has extracted less oil than Scotland
3. Norway is independent

9609 2018-08-23 06:52:46 Oh dear. £53b + UK Allocated costs. No other small indy country has our Oil, Whisky, Farming, Fisheries (Largests in all of Europe) and many more. We are the only part of the uk that export more than we import. There's no way they're letting us go. Ask yourself why? Think man!
9610 2018-08-23 06:52:31 Everyone is abandoning the usa because of their criminal illegitimate President. Just recently India & China(3.2billion ppl) disregarded trump & continue to buy oil from Iran. Trump can’t do shit to no one cause there are other countries(friends of S.african people) who’d trade.
9611 2018-08-23 06:52:29 Never mind that they would get slammed as racist for condemning gang culture...
9612 2018-08-23 06:52:28 Research says that most cheap refined coconut oil sold today is produced from dried coconut and has none of the benefits of fresh, unprocessed virgin coconut oil. Google it to understand the differences.

9614 2018-08-23 06:51:58 Very true-but it goes deeper than that. Americans are not as educated on the various ways we can reduce dependence on oil and coal. Just talking to my brother the other day, he had no idea that a large portion of the metals we need aren't
9615 2018-08-23 06:51:54 I think only Keralites use coconut oil for cooking..

9620 2018-08-23 06:51:22 @SABCNewsOnline only because we will start buying oil from African countries 
9621 2018-08-23 06:50:58 you change oil too?
9622 2018-08-23 06:50:56 I was even wondering if we maybe discovered oil somewhere that he's lowkey angling for. Always an agenda with those ones.
9623 2018-08-23 06:50:52 Kerala is fed and bred on coconut oil, this saturated fatty acid stuff causing Cardiovascular diseases is mostly mischievous
As kerala isn't the capital of cardiovascular diseases despite of coconut oil being large part of staple diet

9625 2018-08-23 06:50:47 So what am I supposed to do now with all this coconut oil?!
9626 2018-08-23 06:50:26 "We need to eat less meat; eat fresh, less-processed food with [less] fatty substances such as palm oil. And we definitely need to stop using palm oil to fuel our cars," he said. #PalmOil
9627 2018-08-23 06:50:19 Or stop making palm oil all together it's destroying our climate and environment not to mention the countless animal lives
9628 2018-08-23 06:50:00 Exactly but why did Africa want Obama to do more for us than his USA? Why do we still buy or sell petrol & oil to the very same USA as Africans?
9629 2018-08-23 06:49:40 the main reason why Trump start to show interest in SA is because of we will be buying oil from African countries. 
9630 2018-08-23 06:49:34 I thought cooking with more interesting ingredients than our parents, for who olive oil was only available from the chemists, was a good thing to come from living in a multicultural country. Apparently now it isn't.

9633 2018-08-23 06:49:03 No guys... That place is slippery because of the water they use to clean the meat and oil too.

9636 2018-08-23 06:48:23 My God, till date my family cooks in coconut oil.
9637 2018-08-23 06:48:19 These idiots must be told my father and grand mother lived upto 90 years lived on coconut oil throughout. Some poison.
A town in palghat has maximum aged population in country. They cook coconut oil.
Truth coconut oil not good for punjabis, butter parota not good for kerala.
9638 2018-08-23 06:48:17 Sorry to hear about your grandfather. Between solar, wind, and millions of other sources, there are many ways to get more invested in renewable sources. Hell, even simply increasing our cobalt supply alone will bring down the cost of E.V's reducing our need for oil/fracking
9639 2018-08-23 06:47:43 Now South Africa plans to buy oil from African countries. Dammm future looks bright for Africa . @CyrilRamaphosa cutting middle man #USA 
9640 2018-08-23 06:47:37 Though the prices of crude oil has declined by 50% from last 4 years, Trade deficit of India can be doubled to 2.8% of GDP from 1.5%of GDP of previous financial year.

9661 2018-08-23 06:44:29 So the same party that lied about the true value of Scottish oil and kept it secret are now saying we must believe the GERS figures. Nae chance.
9662 2018-08-23 06:44:27 my dad showed me how to check my oil forever ago & it was on my first car so that information is useless now 
9663 2018-08-23 06:44:18 At the end of June, WTI Crude Oil was at $74. 15th August, WTI went down to $65. Given that the KES has kept fairly strong against USD, the price of petrol and other oils should come down by October, but if @energy_ke doesn’t set lower prices, we’re in for difficult times..
9664 2018-08-23 06:43:59 No , but did you think b4 u tweeted @GEJonathan made oil market favourable?

Did you ever think Nigeria determines oil price?

How come he couldn't sustain the favourable conditions beyond 2014, so much so that he squandered our external Reserves

9668 2018-08-23 06:43:32 No Jimmy I don't.
Oil tax revenue barely £1B this year (95% to Scotland) and this is unlikely to change as we start to pay decommisioning costs and pay for the tax benefits we gave the oil sector to stay in the N Sea.
The total Scottish spend is close to £70B. Oil not the answer.
9669 2018-08-23 06:43:27 Mostly, it appeared to have been hijacked by snake oil salesmen looking for a gig, leveraging regulations and codes of practice in part written to appease a small clique of privacy obsessives who will brook no usability trade offs.

9672 2018-08-23 06:42:58 Absolutely true. The only figures not supplied by ONS guesswork are the oil and gas ones.
9673 2018-08-23 06:42:53 And #Darkmoney was behind you. Iran i am sure would want to separate England from its oil supply. Not really surprising.
9674 2018-08-23 06:42:49 Sorry, but you’ve done almost everything wrong. Anything you have done right, is by accident and was carried out like a prick who rubs everyone’s nose in it. You are going down and no one will save you. You will go down in history as nothing but a corrupt snake oil salesman.

9676 2018-08-23 06:42:29 I dont believe that coconut oil is good for anything
9677 2018-08-23 06:42:25 "Oil paintings look more realistic because when they dry ... they form a skin , when you peel the skin off its fresh paint" -professor Mcbride
9678 2018-08-23 06:42:25 How about “A Big Mac is pure poison?”  It’s terrifying how one professor can take a stance on a product and completely ignore the presence of Frankenfood pedaled on every corner. Coconut oil is the least of America’s worries. GMO Corn is invading EVERYTHING.

9680 2018-08-23 06:42:04 I urge countries who have no known oil reserves underneath their soils to suspend all oil exploration. Statistically, there seems to be a direct correlation between oil and conflict. Venezuela, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Nigeria, South Sudan & Iraq are a few eamples
9681 2018-08-23 06:41:55 More oil to those lips
9682 2018-08-23 06:41:51 It means it surprising that you are not  outraged by violence against women and children in general. And won’t say shit about an American scumbag who killed his pregnant wife and two daughters and dumped their bodies in an oil well. 

That makes your selective outrage suspect.
9683 2018-08-23 06:41:49 Fear of Coconut oil regaining prominence after west calls it superfood...Cabal at work.
9684 2018-08-23 06:41:48 Coconut oil is a pure natural product which has positive effects on body, yes abundance of anything’s harmful. I am not agree with this research. I am not sure what he is trying to say in research
9685 2018-08-23 06:41:39 I'm not sure, But I think we need to identify the needs of the community near the oil. See how that benefits them and how that can translate to the rest of the country. Then when you draw up a contract, you have a basis where the benefits reach everyone #ExtractivesinEA #OurOil

9707 2018-08-23 06:38:41 Waihiga: Is the sector all about oil?
@OxfamEAfrica - the sector is more than oil. Water, land, minerals and any other natural resources is what the sector is all about. @Ikal_Angelei @citizentvkenya @MadiniKenya
9708 2018-08-23 06:38:36 why is he really talking about SA? oil? gold?
9709 2018-08-23 06:38:23 Except, you can't "patent coconut oil" and that's not what's happening here. 
I just pointed out that you presented an incorrect statistic. The majority of India doesn't consume coconut oil, which is pretty expensive to produce. Please correct your parameters first.
9710 2018-08-23 06:38:03 We are using coconut oil for generations, living normal life like others..
9711 2018-08-23 06:37:55 from childhood I have been applying coconut oil to my hair.
9712 2018-08-23 06:37:40 Oh no have they found oil in seff efrica
9713 2018-08-23 06:37:32 For soup, cook ground onion in oil, then simmer with pork, red curry paste, coconut milk and zucchini. Top with pickled jalapenos.

9720 2018-08-23 06:36:28 @GavinNewsom A higher ZEV requirement no only helps California’s clean air, it also helps California economically.  California is an importer of oil and gasoline cars. However, California produces much of its own electricity and is a net exporter of electric vehicles (via Tesla).

9725 2018-08-23 06:35:19 I douse everything I eat in tobasco and olive oil. That’s kind of healthy right?
9726 2018-08-23 06:35:16 I'll look again but I don't think there is one that excludes oil. There's one with a geographic share and one with a population share. And I always go with geographic... seems fairer.

9739 2018-08-23 06:34:00 If you want to fix your chapped lips, mix olive oil with coarse sugar and apply this blend. You can also add lemon juice to improve the flavor and give the mixture exfoliating properties.
9740 2018-08-23 06:34:00 When you apply olive oil on your face, it can reverse or prevent damage from ultraviolet radiation. At the same time, it keeps your skin hydrated, due to its moisturizing properties.

9746 2018-08-23 06:33:22 It shouldn't be floods which are killing the Keralites, it should be coconut oil. Which oil lobby is behind this?
9747 2018-08-23 06:33:11 Strange... Generations of Mallus have grown up with food made in coconut oil....Our older generation have clicked to the age of 100.....Well, looks like the research is flawed so somehow...
9748 2018-08-23 06:33:02 Question is why is there so little quality research leaving public at mercy of superstitions and beliefs of doctors and dietitians? @guardian We spend millions on diet and vitamins each year and deserve better than "there is no good evidence..." on #coconut oil and saturated fat
9749 2018-08-23 06:32:58 Venezuela's real problem is authoritarianism. You tie the economy to oil and refuse to raise interest rates and you're just asking for a collapse. That's probably why the Nordic model has worked so well compared to more communist/authoritarian models like the USSR
9750 2018-08-23 06:32:43 It's quite appalling & ludicrous the way people twist facts. Figures are there to show, most oil dependent mono economy nation are still wallowing in the murky water of recession. From Venezuela to Angola. It is here some emergency activists forgot in a jiffy

9762 2018-08-23 06:30:08 Anecdotal evidence is not scientifically admissible. All oils used excessively is bad, but some oils are worse than others. Like palm oil. I am no chemist to comment on the findings of said research.

"Coconut oil contains more than 86% saturated fat, more than twice the amount found in lard, and 60% more than is found in lard."

9768 2018-08-23 06:29:20 Eat less starch, drink warm water with lemon and cucumber like a litre in the morning before breakfast,  use olive oil for cooking. Exercise regularly
9769 2018-08-23 06:29:15 It's not a "vegan = always good, meat = always bad" binary. Organic local meat is better than veggies from overseas. Eat organic, local and seasonal food as much as possible. Reduce animal products. Avoid palm oil.

9776 2018-08-23 06:28:41 Our experience doesn't support the contention that Coconut oil is not good for health. Keralites who are the highest consumers of Coconut oil are also among the healthiest.

Many people are apprehending motives behind the recent propoganda against coconut oil.

9778 2018-08-23 06:28:10 Bloody hell! Why does the population of Kerala that solely uses coconuts and coconut oil in everything not come down.

If anything, life expectancy is going up.
9779 2018-08-23 06:28:10 Let’s be real, we only use coconut oil to moisturize our ash prone melanated skin and as a great anal sex lubricant
9780 2018-08-23 06:28:07 Report says "... a lot of heavy machinery and oil." Surprised to read we export so much oil.
9781 2018-08-23 06:28:07 Coconut oil is not unhealthy but too much coconut oil is. There are extremes on both sides and no one wants to meet on the middle ground. It’s either “good” or “bad”. Someone is just making radical statements to get the attention and she got it.

9783 2018-08-23 06:27:31 The Professor just warn about potential overuse of saturated fatty oils if consume with other same type of foods.

If someone maintains a balance between health and diet he need not to be worried.

However every oil has its benefits and harms associated with.

9788 2018-08-23 06:27:14 Ah right, we should be using unsaturated vegetable oils like sunflower oil which are shown to be highly inflammatory, give people acne   and play a major role in liver disease, diabetes and even the formation of cancer. 

Saturated fats are much safer than unsaturated fats.

9791 2018-08-23 06:26:48 The pity about trendy foods is, that people believe the hype and don't do any research.  Coconut oil has never been touted as a healthier option to other oils.
9792 2018-08-23 06:26:48 Lool I just read the article and it’s literally a white lady just tryna discredit coconut oil like let us live
9793 2018-08-23 06:26:37 They were actually islamic revolutionary guard but at the time they were offering an equal share of the oil check.  That never came, just like this progressive compassion I keep hearing about.

9798 2018-08-23 06:26:05 My friend went to Kogalym as part of his Oil Institute practice and was genuinely impressed. The town is apparently swimming in oil money.
9799 2018-08-23 06:25:59 If coconut oil is a "pure poison", Entire Kerala and Coastal Karnataka would have been a bare land. We use coconut and coconut oil in almost every cooking.
9800 2018-08-23 06:25:50 Also places like Australia have very different minimum wage models. It is not a one-size-fits-all like the UK.
And transportation times & costs fluctuate massively depending on demand & global oil pricing too. Both internationally & within Australia. It is a big place.

9802 2018-08-23 06:25:29 I've been using tea tree oil directly on my skin for a few days now, and I just decided to read about it today and saw that you aren't supposed to.  
Ugh!   

What was I thinking anyway?  
9803 2018-08-23 06:24:53 So,  I use it in tablet form because I don't like handling anything that's oily ^ω^ You don't have to change your diet to take it. I take it like a Vitamin.. So everyday.  If you want to use coconut oil in your hair there are a few different ways.  You can leave a modest amount..

9806 2018-08-23 06:24:29 I see that happening in stages. We will still import some oil even though we will be exporting more than is imported. International trade is a tool.

The nation that has the oil has the world as it's customers.

9831 2018-08-23 06:22:12 ..that coconut oil may not be one of the worst foods you can eat, as the article suggests.
9832 2018-08-23 06:22:08 @OfficialPDPNig govt of 2011-2015 earned over US$393 billion in oil proceeds alone. @OfficialAPCNg govt has so far earned only US$94 billion, The price of oil was about half of what it used to be. But with the same $94 billion, we have been able to do far more. -@ProfOsinbajo.

9834 2018-08-23 06:21:56 Most Keralites would also vouch for it. Keralites have been using coconut oil for generations and they  live longer than other Indians.
9835 2018-08-23 06:21:55 クッソ晴れてるけど
9836 2018-08-23 06:21:45 The article talks about nutritional errors and damaging effect of the saturated fatty acids in coconut oil. I am of the opinion that all oils are bad if used excessively. My grandparents lived for long without health problems is just one proof...
9837 2018-08-23 06:21:31 Oh the irony. The Oil industry wants to be protected from climate change. Perhaps they should invest in solar and wind power.
9838 2018-08-23 06:21:23 It’s great enough to be something your club (despite the oil money) cannot do.

Well, we’ve reached 8 of them & won 5. So in reality, your nowhere near us when it comes to European Cup finals. As I said.
9839 2018-08-23 06:21:22 seriously i did'nt get why dis oil is soo poisonous... unless coconut water is gud for hydration purpose...confused...
9840 2018-08-23 06:21:20 Vegetable oil and sunflower oil and spreads from them! Who’s she funded by? She should read Nina Teicholz for enlightenment.

9842 2018-08-23 06:21:07 Oh, as Columbo use to say "Just one ore thing." Listening to a woman Trump supporter at his W. VA rally say she still supported him in spite of all b/c she likes his policies - what may they be idiot? Getting rid of our national monumental parks and allowing oil drilling on them?
9843 2018-08-23 06:21:05 I paid $30 for this organic oil for my dogs skin. This shit better work 
9844 2018-08-23 06:20:59 WPP President Mr. Ben became one of the world’s VIP speakers in green summits, speaking

9845 2018-08-23 06:20:49 I wear coconut oil as lotion regularly
9846 2018-08-23 06:20:32 Emiratis and the Arab dictatorships are incredibly smart people. They arent stupid. They very well know the oil is depleting. But they definitely have alternates planned.
9847 2018-08-23 06:20:32 I have so many mixed feelings about Trudeau, seeing that he’s allowed oil pipelines to go through indigenous land (aka all of Canada) in direct opposition of what most indigenous Canadians wanted, but damn is he a feminist who supports refugees and sound good speeking French 
9848 2018-08-23 06:20:25 Baby Oil... Let me rub you down in baby oil
9849 2018-08-23 06:20:24 ...if you trust Cohen’s accusations, and believe there was a true violation of what my ancestors intended here, then I have lots of snake oil to sell you! @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson @JesseBWatters @JudgeJeanine @VP @realDonaldTrump

9852 2018-08-23 06:20:08 The whole GOP leadership is guilty of conspiracy with the Russians. They knew how much Russian oil oligarch billioniaire money was flowing into the RNC, NRA, Republican campaigns around the country, and that Trump is a pawn of Putin.
9853 2018-08-23 06:20:03 So you drank cooking oil three doses a day and called it anointing oil so what? Where do you find that in the Bible? #TheShepherd
9854 2018-08-23 06:20:02 RT @ValaAfshar: Data is the oil of the 21st century. But oil is just useless thick goop until you refine it into fuel.
9855 2018-08-23 06:19:59 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.

9857 2018-08-23 06:19:48 I'd imagine they will stop arming them when Iran submits to the banking cartel and the oil runs out so they can't pay anymore.
9858 2018-08-23 06:19:46 Canola oil is another fad!!
9859 2018-08-23 06:19:37 International #oil prices slipped on Thursday, weighed down by the escalating trade dispute between the United States and China, although a decline in U.S. commercial crude inventories offered some support.
9860 2018-08-23 06:19:32 I am in pain. Have a country run to make tomorrow and I wasn’t going to drive the car in its current state. Changed the oil, right cv joint, tie rod ends, ball joints, brakes and rotated the tyres.
9861 2018-08-23 06:19:27 Its a bridge that we all agree our system has failed to some degree, but properly identifying the crony capitalism, regulation and governmental power afforded to companies in markets is the problem. Take pharma, food gmo, oil.. We can all agree that gov picks winners and losers

9865 2018-08-23 06:19:00 Lmao I literally use coconut oil all the time and ain’t shit poisonous bout it
9866 2018-08-23 06:18:41 80% refined rice bran oil and 20% refined safflower oil. That's what it says in specifications of Saffola Gold which we use.

Nothing against coconut oil but I can't stand the smell it imparts to some items.
9867 2018-08-23 06:18:35 The oil is gonna deplete soon. It's better fr them , to realise it soon enough. I have heard stories, how men live like crap , just to earn a buck, and send it back home, coz it gets 100 times.

9874 2018-08-23 06:17:48 I thought I remembered from s couple decades ago Taco Bell used to use coconut oil and they switched because they got a bunch of  from the health nuts because it was supposed to be so bad for you. Does anyone else remember this?
9875 2018-08-23 06:17:45 All day! Coconut oil is the truth.
9876 2018-08-23 06:17:36 i am anticipating downwrd movemnt...bcoz of global cues n oil prices rise

9887 2018-08-23 06:16:35 Just because you’re from Harvard doesn’t mean that your claim is true. Coconut oil is a staple in Asia. How come we are slender? Because we eat coconuts and it’s oil is not poison.

9889 2018-08-23 06:16:18 last night we were blasting another night on mars by the maine and singing at the top of our voices while driving and then suddenly a cop told us to turn around and go back and then a parade of cop cars with sirens and massive oil trucks drove past us it was astounding
9890 2018-08-23 06:16:17 Yeah, they managed to pick up all the human excrement laying all over the joint...
9891 2018-08-23 06:16:14 @realDonaldTrump no need to take a closer look at our land, we don't have oil, sit back down, get your facts straight, and focus on your own nation for once.

9897 2018-08-23 06:15:32 Hello Donny. 

Your office's need to follow every gas, oil and energy pipeline around the world is what's producing large scale killings. Not to mention the police on black violence in your own backyard.

Kindly refrain from confusing your people in our name. Eat shit. Thanks bye

9908 2018-08-23 06:13:50 You can't get anything done, when the law makers are taking money by big oil.
Same reason you can't have cheap prescription drugs, because big pharma are one of the biggest donors that pay the politicians to make sure they can charge whatever they want.
9909 2018-08-23 06:13:43 And coconut oil is next best to cow's ghee.
9910 2018-08-23 06:13:32 Does anyone have any recommendations on how to combat oily hair?! Or any shampoos they recommend? I have to wash my hair almost twice a day to keep the oil at bay and not even dry shampoo helps. I can't even go a full 24 hours without washing my hair  Help a girl out please
9911 2018-08-23 06:13:24 Procura por national oil companies, pouquíssimas são privadas. E ainda existe cartel em algumas privadas.

9912 2018-08-23 06:13:02 Cooking in this expansion sucks, 90% of the food uses expensive vendor mats and fish oil

9918 2018-08-23 06:11:23 How is Scotland oil more difficult to get out than Norway. To drill & complete wells in Norway is a lot more expensive than in Scotland. A lot of their wells are in The Barents Sea, the environmental factors make it very difficult and expensive to drill and complete.
9919 2018-08-23 06:11:13 I know three things about coconut oil:

1) It's probably not a magic cure-all
2) Nor does it cause cancer of the every organ system
And most importantly...
3) Popcorn is delicious when popped in it, as movie theaters knew before everyone flipped out over saturated fat.
9920 2018-08-23 06:11:05 *slathering my entire body with and devouring an entire jar of coconut oil*

9921 2018-08-23 06:10:52 I'm not a expert but I work with them. They always compared coconut oil to lard.
9922 2018-08-23 06:10:51 Got to be the olive oil one. In the Independent piece, ghee was clubbed along with coconut oil in the 'dangerous amounts of bad fatty acids' category.

9969 2018-08-23 06:04:40 Calling a mainstream food ‘pure poison’ is very unhelpful #coconutoil it creates consumer confusion, as it’s clearly not poisonous. It’s also an oil so it’s not going to be nutritious, full of vitamins and it will be high in fat and should be used sparingly like all other oils.

9978 2018-08-23 06:03:18 Light layer of oil inside and outside. Bake in a hot ass oven upside down for like an hour
9979 2018-08-23 06:03:05 Those are ALA sources for the most part, so they don’t get absorbed as easily as something like algal oil for example. But algal oil is soooo expensive
9980 2018-08-23 06:02:57 My pimple shrinked. Tea tree oil did that 
9981 2018-08-23 06:02:55 @untheone there's enough for one to chew on in the market these days. Long gone are the days of blue chip Oil and Bank stocks
9982 2018-08-23 06:02:55 Olive oil lobby to create fear, same happened for Groundnut Oil basically suits our climate but moved to Refined Sin(un) flower oil ... look at BP Sugar & Pressure issues.. 
False propaganda

9984 2018-08-23 06:02:42 We just started her on it this week and so far so good! I've talked to many people who have had great success treating their dogs with cbd oil. A friend of ours dog hasn't had a seizure in over 3 years since she's been on it
9985 2018-08-23 06:02:17 โหลดยังไงคะแอด
9986 2018-08-23 06:01:54 Yeah, the drop accelerated the collapse, but Chavez said socialism would still work even if oil price was set to $0 lol.

9989 2018-08-23 06:01:19 SF period is garbage. Such a shame too, b/c it’s on such a beautiful location right on the coast, but leftists destroy everything they touch.
9990 2018-08-23 06:01:06 Everyone is entitled to their own opinion... Hawa wanaijo who put coconut oil in everything and they're still alive 
9991 2018-08-23 06:01:00 And now big oil want help with effects of climate change!?
9992 2018-08-23 06:00:43 実際、酒(特にビール)の卸販売業って体力勝負で体育会的な乗りが強いと聞き及びます。でもこのご時世ブラック企業のレッテルが貼られると厳しいですから。
9993 2018-08-23 06:00:43 I never stated what the core issues were, I was more noting that the collapse in Oil prices made things go downhill faster than they otherwise would have.
9994 2018-08-23 06:00:01 I use the oil on my body and it must of got on it from my hand etc

The oil is used 100 percent ... Are there no population
9997 2018-08-23 05:59:24 Now they can’t fool us. From “salt n charcoal” is not good for teeth to “kya apke toothpaste me namak hai” & “all new charcoal toothpaste” they have fooled us. Now they probably wish to patent coconut oil n then repackage n sell it to us only !!?? #India won’t allow this anymore
9998 2018-08-23 05:59:24 I like the concept, except that the seed oils bit, shouldn't come under any food group - it should be classified as machine oil. 
Are there any actual studies that prove seeds per se are good  for us?
9999 2018-08-23 05:59:18 Democrats = Open Borders, Sanctuary Cities, Higher Taxes, Higher Unemployment, Higher Gas & Oil Prices.
10000 2018-08-23 05:59:15 Healthy or not can we just stop putting it in/on everything. As someone who is alergic, its a bummer to all of a sudden see the health good market flooded with "now made with coconut oil, water, sugar"  ... please

10007 2018-08-23 05:58:34 A gifted snake oil salesman
10008 2018-08-23 05:58:16 #KeralaFloodRelief If central govt is refusing monetary help from Middle east, can it ask for relief in KIND? Like crude oil worth 100 Million $. Will cut down the import bill and benefits can be  passed onto Kerala govt. Socho Socho. @narendramodi @ndtv @timesofindia
10009 2018-08-23 05:58:12 Tell them to F we malllus lived by centuries with the pure oil and live long
10010 2018-08-23 05:58:01 @PMOIndia India should stop it's expendability on Saudi Oil and search for its own options and resources to meet Fuel Consumption in individual Domestic market in India, Without harming the tax generating  resources, like Crude oil
10011 2018-08-23 05:57:59 Saturated fats and nutritionists.. they live the old lie. SatFat raises ‘bad’ cholesterol and will kill you. Please don’t point them to ‘paradoxes’ like Kerala! They get all confused!?!?  oil will become a problem when 7-11 comes to town. And then they’ll say it’s  oil...
10012 2018-08-23 05:57:31 DPF regen. It means the ECU will force extra diesel to initiate a very hot burning phase to burn off the soot. Keep an eye on your oil level since any unburned fuel finds its way into the sump - especially if regen is cancelled when engine is switched off mid way through cycle.
10013 2018-08-23 05:57:25 Topical magnesium oil or gel... you dont have to live with leg cramps lol
10014 2018-08-23 05:57:24 when will my essential oil diffuser cure my depression @SajeWellness lmk
10015 2018-08-23 05:57:07 Like we are unaffected by sunshine but it gives the westerners heavy burns, maybe coconut oil chokes them too.
10016 2018-08-23 05:57:03 はぁ……白赤の結婚式は赤血球ちゃんが唯一赤色じゃなくて1146カラーの白に染まる時なんだ……
それを見た1146君は純粋に綺麗だ、って思うし言葉には表せないけど赤血球ちゃんが白色に染まっていてなんとも言えない満ち足りた感じになるんだ……
10017 2018-08-23 05:57:03 Black castor oil or tea tree oil. Coconut oil is trash on my head.
10018 2018-08-23 05:57:01 Imagine that he didn’t use a gun,,. Tick tick motherf*cker. Ban oil drums now
