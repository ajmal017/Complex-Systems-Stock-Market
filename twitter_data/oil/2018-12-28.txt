1 2018-12-28 23:59:41 1.He didn’t accept money from “ executives”. Individual donors have to state who their employer is. (Which you would know if you’ve ever donated) He lives in Texas-millions of people there work for oil companies! That doesn’t mean they’re executives
2 2018-12-28 23:59:26 Which line of Cantu stuff do you use? I’ve only ever used the coconut oil products
3 2018-12-28 23:59:22 ❝But do be careful with the sugars, and also the oil that used for deep frying it.❞
4 2018-12-28 23:59:17 Ever had heart ache?
Ever lost money tryna learn how to cook oil base?
5 2018-12-28 23:59:10 Shea butter, cocoa butter, and coconut oil. Mix until pastey. Love, a rigger whose hands are constantly covered in chalk, grime, and grease 
6 2018-12-28 23:58:56 Someone asked you to write for them and they offered you compensation for it? That sounds terrible. 

Did they want you to lie and sell snake oil too?
7 2018-12-28 23:58:38 Interesting take on the old tron game. Models look good. I’d like to see various bike skins, ability to change bike speed or rate of wall placement, shield to allow you to break one barrier, oil slick to disrupt other players controls, maybe non planar playing field
8 2018-12-28 23:58:24 That likely wouldn’t be Beto. Taking money from big oil means he will mostly be on his knees
9 2018-12-28 23:58:22 I overdosed on marijuana oil last night..
10 2018-12-28 23:58:22 Take vit D, garlic and oil of oregano daily as well as cinnamon tablets
11 2018-12-28 23:58:21 Oh! Everything but the bagel seasoning, plain coconut milk, ghee, coconut milk yogurt, cauliflower rice, zucchini spirals, mango green tea, frozen asparagus, cauliflower pizza, raw almond butter, coconut oil spray for eggs
12 2018-12-28 23:58:20 Not even @NancyPelosi advocates for taking down barriers we have now that are poorly designed but still reduce crossings. In fact they allocate $ to repair them. If they didnt work why fix them?
13 2018-12-28 23:58:08 Wow! Thought it was just me. I be out in these streets feeling fine af and then boom...my ankles that I SLATHERED in oil are white af.
14 2018-12-28 23:58:02 Oh NVM so there's a hole in the oil pan.
15 2018-12-28 23:57:56 If you know so much about TX, then why are you (mis)interpreting donations from employees of the oil and gas industry as big oil? And by people like you, I mean people who worship at the altar of Bernie. Nobody is progressive enough but Bernie. Nobody has pure motives but Bernie.
16 2018-12-28 23:57:52 I will consider the Cons when all of Harper’s sycophants are gone and they cease being a lobby-group for Big Oil and corporate elites. The Government of Canada should serve the people, not entities.
17 2018-12-28 23:57:50 I just discovered my mom has been opening the bathroom window. It costs $700 to fill the heating oil tank. I can freak out at her, right? She’s also really shitty about turning lights off, which is a constant struggle.

36 2018-12-28 23:57:41 The oil contribution story is a bad argument against Beto.

 Much more damning is the stuff about what he did for his father-in-law while on the El Paso city council. I like Beto a lot but he's going to have to provide better answers on that than he has if he wants my support
37 2018-12-28 23:57:36 #DontThrowItAway #contest #KarvyGrowthHub 
This used bottle can be of great use at home. 
1. By cuttng the cover side we can do plantimg and hang sumwere as a hanging planter.
2. By making a medium.size  whole in the  cover now add oil in the bottle and cover it. Kitchen heloful
38 2018-12-28 23:57:28 Labeling when something has peanut oil and not having peanuts sneak onto things. I’d prefer to keep living.
39 2018-12-28 23:57:22 I can’t speak on the cleanser but I do rinse immediately. My skin is super dry and does not like cleansers  (even oil cleansers leave me dry).
40 2018-12-28 23:57:08 *looks at hemp oil products for my anxiety, depression, and insomnia as well as minor back pain* *is expensive* Guess I'll suffer
41 2018-12-28 23:57:07 Coconut oil!...It’s life
42 2018-12-28 23:57:06 I already asked. But she is going deeper in oil

43 2018-12-28 23:57:06 Strawberry Rhubarb Dermafoliant and Wildflower Ultra Light Oil 
44 2018-12-28 23:57:00 I’m a firm believe in the fact that good bread should never be sullied with any extra ingredients. Olive oil and salt, maybe, but nutella? Peanut butter? Anything resembling a sandwich? Nuh-uh. Good bread is a privilege and hard to come by when you’re gluten-free
45 2018-12-28 23:56:50 I cannot wait until I have my own house with a garage so I can do my own oil changes in 30 minutes, rather than waiting 2 hours at the mechanic. 
46 2018-12-28 23:56:35 Oooo how do you like the Castor oil? I have been using coconut to L.O.C
47 2018-12-28 23:56:28 My face is clean & moisturized with coconut oil . I don’t want to ruin it with makeup . Do I really have to get ready?
48 2018-12-28 23:56:14 This particular kit wasn't all that bad. All you really have to do is glue on the neck, fret board, and bridge, then install the tuners and strings. We sanded it pretty well, then finished it with boiled linseed oil. It's a ukulele, so the stresses probably aren't like a guitar.
49 2018-12-28 23:56:07 That’s either a dude or a cocktail waitress on an oil rig
50 2018-12-28 23:55:46 I still expect CAD to move up. I'm not sure it will get to .87. Our northern neighbor is facing some economic headwinds but we should get a rebound in oil and metal prices in coming months. That should really help CAD.
51 2018-12-28 23:55:32 I rub it on my temples and and sinuses, very small amount keeping the oil well away from eyes.
52 2018-12-28 23:55:27 I’m a man. I’m about to cook a hotdog. In oil. By myself. Hot oil. Really hot.  
? Nothing. ?
53 2018-12-28 23:55:27 With the *oil slick* pizza *IN THE HOOD*
54 2018-12-28 23:55:25 Instead of using the excuse that they will dig under it, at least MAKE them dig. They might climb it, at least MAKE  them climb 30 ft rather than just strolling across open ground.
55 2018-12-28 23:55:21 CHAIR POO, KIND A ODOROUS LIGHT IS LATE. SO POOPY YOU CAN PIRATE ON THE PALM OIL BEFORE MEOW MESSAGE ON MY FART LOVER WHO PARENTS A VOLCANO AFTER YOU PLAYER TRAVELS US ABOUT WOMAN ON TURKEY. CLOWN PUPPET JOKES VERY WITTY BUT WITH WHEN FORM MEETS FUNCTION ANDROID
56 2018-12-28 23:55:21 Yeah I L.O.C my hair when I do washes so I put the Cantu coconut oil leave in conditioner,coconut oil and then the Cantu curl activator
57 2018-12-28 23:55:06 Oil companies aren't corporate lobbyists?
58 2018-12-28 23:55:02 lol, an ultimate sacrifice to steal another country's oil and resources, while murdering its population and devastating their infrastructure based on lies. Soldiers are brainwashed tools of Empire and the only ones we should respect are former ones who are for peace and not war.
59 2018-12-28 23:55:02 Also, it is near impossible to find 100% #Green funds. One can buy stock, like I do, in individual companies, but #Funds are a more cost-effective way to invest and they all have some mix of #oil and #gas ... ‘course maybe you don’t care cuz you just want to slam her ...

61 2018-12-28 23:54:35 And he voted with the GOP on a few oil and gas issues. It's fair to say Sirota didn't have exactly the full picture with that 1 tweet though his article brought some fair questions of Beto's record. Fassler, are you sure you're not too close for objectivity? Take some distance...
62 2018-12-28 23:54:25 Sore losers. They really had planned to enriched themselves with the proceeds of the oil. That's why they can't let go. Why they're clinging on at all cost. They also definitely know they cannot defeat the PPP.
63 2018-12-28 23:54:09 Oh the “red oil”, my Mema used to swear by that stuff.
64 2018-12-28 23:53:44 Go get coconut oil!!!
65 2018-12-28 23:53:37 Yo Tongue gotta make her body lock up like a 87’ Impala wit no oil in it
66 2018-12-28 23:53:30 Dad in the loudest voice possible: “ALEXIS PUT OLIVE OIL ON SHOPPING LIST” 

67 2018-12-28 23:53:30 おそよう
68 2018-12-28 23:53:03 Bitch just get a Tesla ! No oil changes ever , and no gas ! :p
69 2018-12-28 23:52:59 Despicable!!!! Why don’t you cut off aid to the Middle East!! They have oil money. We are supposed to support the Western Hemisphere. It’s the Monroe Doctrine!
70 2018-12-28 23:52:58 As #GPpharmacists I'm making "heartless" decisions most days. Asking elderly carer for partner with terminal disease or /teen pregnancy or/families from deprived areas to get treatment OTC. No emollient bath oil for child. Have to stick to principles + be consistent - whole team.
71 2018-12-28 23:52:53 กลับบ้านเกิด ตอนนี้รถติดมาพี่ 
72 2018-12-28 23:52:51 That's a really cool talking point to go crazy over. But if I happened to land a job at an oil company, and was able to feed my family doing so, I would still be donating to candidates who opposed my employer.
73 2018-12-28 23:52:47 I could swim in a pool of Shea, almond and coconut oil....

But my ankles will almost ALWAYS miss the moisture.

How Lord? Make it make sense.
74 2018-12-28 23:52:45 Tumeric n coconut oil scrub. Feel like i reddy to marrid come sunday. 

Lemme find them okd sheets before i stain everything again 
75 2018-12-28 23:52:44 My conscience is now clear knowing I got that oil change that my car has been asking for for the last 4K miles. And apparently a couple new filters here and there that were desperately needed, Oops. 
76 2018-12-28 23:52:40 Parsley sauce (lemon & olive oil added to minced parsley) over braesaola is amazing. Also need to use flat leaf.
77 2018-12-28 23:52:23 Wish I was there to give you a nice hot oil back massage.  They always help me so much when I have my back spasms.
78 2018-12-28 23:52:21 imperialism is anti-humanitarian. USA despises the freedom of brown people. "How dare they? We deserve to rule" the slogan of white nationalism.

Saddam Hussein gassing kurds and communists - "good guy". Tries to do healthcare and share oil profits with civilians - "evil despot"
79 2018-12-28 23:52:19 I streamed the entirety of oil of every pearls un-insides on my new speaker to let it know excellence
80 2018-12-28 23:52:07 Wall is a force/ resource multiplier. It creates choke points, paths of least resistance. A barrier coupled with surveillance is more effective thn surveillance alone. 
No one thing will STOP it, but combined they will significantly reduce it. Worthy goal
81 2018-12-28 23:52:03 What a blunder prez.trump announcing that premature abrupt withdrawal..TURKS .blunt only seeing the oil fields etc in mineral rich Kurdistan...in DT shoe  I will stun the world in the right way, JAWANS STAY PUT gen.Mattis u ain't going nowhere! think about it....

83 2018-12-28 23:52:02 and on the 5th day the Lord said beware of people who don’t salt and oil their pasta water
84 2018-12-28 23:52:02 People like me?  My family has deep roots in Texas since, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 and not one single person in my family works for for the oil industry.  I know a lot about Texas.  And guess what?  I have an agenda,  actually,  it's the Green New Deal.
85 2018-12-28 23:51:51 Only thing it’s missing is the oil for dipping the bread.......
86 2018-12-28 23:51:42 It's no surprise that @USRepKCastor doesn't want to ban members from a select committee on climate if they have taken fossil fuel's money.

She has taken $2,951 from oil & gas companies herself!

Let's have a #GreenNewDeal, not a deal for the fossil fuel companies. @sunrisemvmt
87 2018-12-28 23:51:25 My area she has chased off businesses and cut our funding for road construction etc etc because we are oil country.. so our taxes now are insane .. but someone cutting friendship off is pretty shallow
88 2018-12-28 23:51:24 Y’all really horny for Tyler Seguin? That human bald spot dipped in leftover fry oil and homophobia? Him?
89 2018-12-28 23:51:22 ぽはようー！
90 2018-12-28 23:51:22 Well the only thing that was missing was the oil and seasoning for the bread. So I know the dasher didn't take that. 
91 2018-12-28 23:51:20 100%. The only thing I don’t do usually is my own oil because depending on where you live, proper disposal can be difficult. Plus sometimes it’s cheaper to have it done.

94 2018-12-28 23:51:06 We should never have gone into the middle east. Our Gov says it was to prevent their Gov. From committing genocide against their own people. What a lie all over Africa they have killed millions of their citizens and we just looked the other way. Oil,  oil, oil, money, money

96 2018-12-28 23:50:36 #OIL #OOTT #WTI 
WTI's volatility is ultra high but #SPX is even more so. It's very difficult to handle SPX roller coaster ride. It's very likely to lose a few thousand dollars in no time when trading SPX.
97 2018-12-28 23:50:30 Norway also has higher taxes, and higher oil royalties. They were smart enough to put in long term plans and tax resources appropriately. We could learn a lot from that Democratic Socialist country
98 2018-12-28 23:49:59 It wasn’t that simple. He met with over 30 oil and gas executives at a fundraising event and they all gave him the maximum 2700 donation. It may not be a super pac but it has influence
99 2018-12-28 23:49:58 I can tell!  You really have a gift! Just wonderful!  I love art too, I am not as good at drawing as you are! I am an avid miniaturist and have done some small oil paintings, but my favorite is working with wood, and sculpting. I have more power tools than my husband!  lol

103 2018-12-28 23:49:33 @realDonaldTrump While you are fighting for this asinine wall and everyone's attention is directed elsewhere, Russia is moving into Venezuela, taking their oil, and getting closer and closer to the US. Build a wall for that!!!

105 2018-12-28 23:49:31 What are the best essential oil brands?
106 2018-12-28 23:49:27 Whoopee Canadians your oil rich, your gonna be rich, your gonna pollute the planet, and Trudea's gonna destroy your country.
107 2018-12-28 23:49:26 Roasted with olive oil and then a generous handful of parmesan at the end is tasty
108 2018-12-28 23:49:23 350 is funded by the Standard Oil folks. Why do they need donations?

113 2018-12-28 23:49:14 The people running the pledge already removed Beto from their list, so what exactly is your point? They clearly concur with Robinson that individual donations from oil execs violate the pledge.

115 2018-12-28 23:49:10 But I can get higher ketones by using MCT oil. I’m just not sure that doing so serves any real purpose.
116 2018-12-28 23:49:09 Using CBD oil the last few weeks and I have to say it's been life changing  for the first time in years finally getting decent sleep and starting to feel like a normal person! Can't recommend it enough

118 2018-12-28 23:49:00 Waiting for a handful of Democrats to turn on this and sabotage it, just like they always do. MIC/health insurance/pharma/big oil always finds just enough Democratic votes when they need them.
119 2018-12-28 23:48:55 So taking money from employees who may disagree with their employer's existence and/or lobbying efforts is somehow an indictment of Beto taking money from the actual oil companies?
120 2018-12-28 23:48:54 I love the coconut curl cream I use with coconut oil for my wash and go
121 2018-12-28 23:48:46 I was waaaaaay more scared of her tone than them demons. Them demons I’d just cast out with anointing oil, but Momma Mallory had me shook!
122 2018-12-28 23:48:42 It wasn’t as de-contextualized as you think: he had signed a pledge to not accept money from oil/gas industry execs. If Bernie had broken a pledge and it was reported on, none of the people attacking Sirota would have a problem.

125 2018-12-28 23:48:25 We actually have a huge environmental program planned for January with an oil major. They’re spending a TON of money on this.

So yah, the oil patch actually spends a shit ton of money on environmental work.
126 2018-12-28 23:48:19 I'm so sad I just dropped my Aragon oil & lost more than half the bottle
127 2018-12-28 23:48:16 Remember zero where the Spanish was taking the gold from underneath Mexico it seems like mankind has repeated itself but not for gold. It's for oil Kuwait with oil and how many other countries will be over oil for us to put our foot in with investors who are greedy

130 2018-12-28 23:47:46 So rather than set up their own version of a Norwegian fund, Chavez squandered away Venezuela’s oil wealth leaving its citizens w/ nothing. That little nuance is what Republicans fail to cite about The social contract Chavez had. Heavy taxation does work & Norway is an example.
131 2018-12-28 23:47:36 I’ll take Seguin on the Oil, but ChiaP has already traded him once.

133 2018-12-28 23:47:30 Wow, are you this naive or just stupid? BetoBoy speaks out of both sides of his mouth. He is a snake oil salesman. He did nothing in Congress. He WON'T be bipartisan, #socialist. Besides #Dems don't allow compromise, they goosestep. He is "let's get along (unless I disagree) man"

136 2018-12-28 23:47:12 @NBCNews Watched your program this evening on Venezuela conditions. Why is the government collapsing? Do they not supply countries with oil? Follow up please.
137 2018-12-28 23:47:10 Actually, my company does millions of dollars of work for oil companies trying to reduce their environmental liabilities. They spend a lot of money on this every year.

139 2018-12-28 23:47:03 I hope that the 325k employees of oil/gas and associated industries will recognize that the Democratic candidate for President is their best hope for their future and their families.
140 2018-12-28 23:46:51 Oil.. need some more tires cause I’m sliding across the road
141 2018-12-28 23:46:48 He’s incredibly rich and has no firm positions of any kind. He also pretended to be Mexican to get votes and is owned by oil and gas. No thanks.

143 2018-12-28 23:46:39 A dried one. She thought the Watts house was amazing!
It was nice. But, nothing special if you come from oil money.  Please! V
144 2018-12-28 23:46:32 lmao beto o’rourke is like vanilla ice cream without the vanilla flavor. and with wads of money from oil execs stuffed in it. it’s a complicated metaphor

146 2018-12-28 23:46:21 It's oil, it's wheat, it's soil, it's meat, it's beef!
147 2018-12-28 23:46:20 I LOVE seeing cartoon or comic characters in oil! This doesn't top Randi oil wrestling her dad but it's still great!
148 2018-12-28 23:46:18 Does oil pulling actually work ? #askadentist
149 2018-12-28 23:46:14 Check your Transmission oil today.

152 2018-12-28 23:45:55 Do you have any peppermint oil for your headache? I use it for sinus headaches and it really helps. Actually, I think it will work on most headaches.
153 2018-12-28 23:45:54 Hahahaha! You think scientists are doing this for the money! Hahaha! 

Of course! Those poor misunderstood oil companies that are scraping by with pennies to get out the truth of how fossil fuels are good for humanity. We should support their labor of love! Hahaha!
154 2018-12-28 23:45:46 Brakes, Rotors, 85 miles past due for an oil change, lights inside the car just stopped today  but its a grand marquis with 5% tint  and she runs great.
155 2018-12-28 23:45:37 Yeah probably disgruntled worker not much environment engineering needs in the oil patch at this time .
156 2018-12-28 23:45:36 Oh no that happened to me too  clove oil will now be your best friend. Hope you get better soon 
157 2018-12-28 23:45:26 try the ordinary or garden of wisdom or the inkey list vitamin c serum/cream/oil.
158 2018-12-28 23:45:19 oil and arms sales? As a Christian, I am regularly angered and dismayed that Christians will fight for fetuses but make excuses so they can look the other way from human suffering because politicians tell them they should. To be pro-life is pro-LIFE, not pro-fetus. Until you’re
159 2018-12-28 23:45:14 Tea tree oil?
160 2018-12-28 23:45:08 You said you were going to get Mexico to pay for it! Why do we have to pay for it!! You are a snake oil salesmen!!
161 2018-12-28 23:44:57 This really does sound EXACTLY like Hillary & the “I’m with her” cult.

Warmongering, voting for the Iraq war, taking large bank speaking fees, supporting fracking & big oil companies & Silicon Valley monopolies, all suddenly became the “Liberal” position for Hillbots everywhere.
162 2018-12-28 23:44:53 Essential Oil Therapy You Can Afford & Give
In 1970, travels in India, sparking my childhood memory, demanded that I bring essential oil therapies to my community. Buying research materials from England & France, I set up retail centers to sell these rare personalized therapies.
163 2018-12-28 23:44:41 I’m getting a oil change and rotating tires and nobody wants to come get meHaters
164 2018-12-28 23:44:37 Vietnam mobile had the lease for oil. My dad even said it was over oil rest in peace dated in the 50s there was a core sample we haven't changed one bit U.S. investors is coming more grittier for the money for the rich.
165 2018-12-28 23:44:35 Are Nigerians with the mindset ready for productivity. The Asians by their culture and ethics give strong credence to hardwork,sadly the oil boom,military intervention and the politics of get rich or die trying has created a culture of reward without effort. Speak to that first.
166 2018-12-28 23:44:29 My beard oil just came. Litty titty.
167 2018-12-28 23:44:27 Crude oil fund positioning was grotesquely one sided overbought long and then proceeded to liquidate as a percentage of overall open interest.   Bonds on the otherhand...
168 2018-12-28 23:44:23 Spent coffee grinds go into a shower scrub along with coconut oil and salt. Bam! Recycling + health bennies. Oh and smooth thighs.
169 2018-12-28 23:44:13 @HelloFresh Love your food! With two kids it saves me so much time and energy! 2 random thoughts. 1- let people order two of same meal in a week if they want 2- if you wanted an awesome welcome gift for newcomers it would be a bottle of olive oil!
170 2018-12-28 23:43:59 Possibility of door slamming shut on illegal immigration on southern border has dimms frantic. It would disprove notion the only way to get control is Comp immigration reform.
This nonsense about legal overstays is desperate diversionary attempt.
171 2018-12-28 23:43:50 I don't know about CBD oil, but I've read that marijuana smoking can decrease the frequency of dreams. So maybe the CBD has something to do with that
172 2018-12-28 23:43:44 BS fixer guy. I keep giving & giving & giving real solutions & You ignore the solutions. You ignore the fact that intelligent, non-violent protest via BDS is working. Thats why treasonous corp  zionazicon oligarch oil war banker owned politicians are criminalizing protest & bds.
173 2018-12-28 23:43:36 Baby oil & nakedness
174 2018-12-28 23:43:36 I was changing my air fresheners and some of the oil got all over my hands, which now smell like vanilla and other stuff.

Not the worst fate to befall anybody, probably.
175 2018-12-28 23:43:31 What if I WANT hot oil on my peepee??? This is kinkshaming.
176 2018-12-28 23:43:23 VERY suspicious!! Big pharma, health insurance, banking and financial services, oil companies - he has a lot of "people" NOT wanting him to win -
177 2018-12-28 23:43:18 This idiot couldn win another election for anything. Hes been exposed for the snake oil salesman that he is!
178 2018-12-28 23:43:15 No reason to be with oil as low as it is for crude. Fear monger and pricing fixing all it is
179 2018-12-28 23:43:10 Who are you trying to kid?  Your “Us”, aka Neoliberals, have done their very best to vote with trump & GOPers, not to mention appoint oil to a climate position. Fucking joke!
180 2018-12-28 23:42:58 If the EPA shuts down forever, I promise I wont pour used engine oil, on the ground...........
181 2018-12-28 23:42:44 Canada could always buy it's oil from America. We are now producing more oil than we are using. I agree that clean energy is a necessity but it can't be done overnight and it would require much environmental destruction. Much of the material needed for the tech requires mining.
182 2018-12-28 23:42:42 No, I'm comparing seed oil to those that Monsanto and the healthy food industry are promoting.

That's the heuristic.

Of course there are exceptions, and sesame oil seems to be one of them.

The signal behind the heuristic is newness, not seed oil in-and-of-itself.
183 2018-12-28 23:42:23 Fake flirting got me a 50% off discount on my oil chaNGE I LOVE BEING A FEMALE HAHHAHAHAAH
184 2018-12-28 23:41:59 I’m pretty good at cooking. I keep a level head. Unless oil pops into me then I call it A FUCKJNG CUNT as loud as I can.
185 2018-12-28 23:41:55 Trump let Mexico have their oil it will give them jobs we have enough in our stock market. Mexico will not come if there r jobs u want the wall 2hide the drilling when u purchase land in Texas4 investors we r having problems with the Middle East over oil Vietnam was the same way

187 2018-12-28 23:41:33 Moisturized with lavender oil and I have a black seaweed mask on. I’m blessed
188 2018-12-28 23:41:27 True. That’s true. Pull up the Dow Jones on stock charts though. Incredibly scary outlook and futures are garbage. Combined with an absolute million ton burning of excess gas per day due to the oil over production and falling barrel prices. Consumers have disposable income but..
189 2018-12-28 23:41:26 K well the oil needs to calm down cause I moisturize consistently. I'm tiredt
190 2018-12-28 23:41:02 サンプル普通に登場人物紹介ものせるべきですね？
191 2018-12-28 23:40:59 whoever signed me up to get cannabis oil newsletters sent to my email... why?
192 2018-12-28 23:40:59 Oh my gosh! Of course! I picked up some Murphy oil soap so we can do some finishing touches this weekend:) stuff is hard to get rid of and I totally get it. You did great & here’s to a brand new house!! You deserve it:)
193 2018-12-28 23:40:46 be sure to hide an oil painting of yourself in an attic before getting stuck in the @AmericanAir priority lane @iah or you won’t live long enough to see an agent
194 2018-12-28 23:40:45 For sure.  Velocity was greater in oil vs. Yields gradual rise.
195 2018-12-28 23:40:28 Homemade honey and grapeseed oil with a heat cap. Wash with yes to carrots.
196 2018-12-28 23:40:16 Right tahini in the middle East and even southern indians(India) have had a long history of using sesame oil
197 2018-12-28 23:40:13 ブレーキランプ5回点滅、ごま油のサイン。
198 2018-12-28 23:40:08 Oil changes are actual pretty cheap it’s only 18$ in labor and the rest is oil and filter. IMO it’s worth paying someone to change your oil.
199 2018-12-28 23:40:06 Need refineries? Why hasn't a new refinery been built in North America in 30 years?? Could it be they are not needed? You can't ship gas/diesel like you can oil.
200 2018-12-28 23:40:00 Word! Only thing is she’s been pissed all day!!! I don’t blame her since she just got the car 2 months ago and we did so much work to it (oil change, brakes, headlights, remote start)
201 2018-12-28 23:39:57 Many of those who were removed from office kept a low profile. Ishaq, I would agree, the problems cited are still around. The previous oil minister embezzled way more than Umuru Dikko, sadly both of them (and their embezzled funds) found shelter in the U.K.
202 2018-12-28 23:39:57 Oil change and inspection sticker
203 2018-12-28 23:39:50 I reckon 90% of us motorcyclists know which oil to use in our machines (or maybe that’s optimistic?)
204 2018-12-28 23:39:41 Wait so whats wrong with seed oil again?
205 2018-12-28 23:39:11 Trump Vietnam was over oil under communist rule Mexico is not communist Rule and they have oil you want that oil to better the billionaires and millionaires then making another country slowly grow out of a third world country you know there's oil over there and you want the wall
206 2018-12-28 23:38:55 DMA's are the Best Musicians to come out of Australia since ACDC,Midnight Oil,Kylie Minogue,Crowded House,Dannii Minogue and Natalie Imbruglia
207 2018-12-28 23:38:52 Acrylic paint. I prefer oil, but it takes forever and a half to dry in Florida.
208 2018-12-28 23:38:32 also that money was from 2016. Bernie did not receive one single dollar from the gun industry in 2018. If Beto stops taking oil money in 2020 the criticism will stop.
209 2018-12-28 23:38:21 Isn’t canola oil made in a lab?
210 2018-12-28 23:38:13 My little brother and the goofiest guy I know. Kinda miss him but also we’re like oil and water.
211 2018-12-28 23:38:12 @realDonaldTrump So you want to shut down the southern border. Why not shut down the northern one too. Stop all the auto parts, oil, electricity, steel and everything else you get from Canada. See how long you hold out for fucknuts. But do it immediately.
212 2018-12-28 23:38:07 This shows how little you know about Texas. And thank you for demonstrating my point. Sirota knew what he was doing. This new talking point that Beto is sponsored by big oil is a direct consequence of his article. He had an agenda, and for people like you it worked to perfection.
213 2018-12-28 23:38:03 living my best life w/ my oil diffuser I got for Xmas
214 2018-12-28 23:37:57 Ikr. Youngtaek asked him to put oil in the pan then he picks up the soy sauce. Good thing that Youngtaek caught him before he pours that. It would have been a mess lol
215 2018-12-28 23:37:52 Your bio literally contradicts this reply (if you bother researching global oil pricing & supply/demand).
216 2018-12-28 23:37:35 them $80 oil changes add up
217 2018-12-28 23:37:32 Thanks for these! That first one looks excellent! There’s a few things that helped my cognition return: LDN, CoEnzymeQ10, and fish oil are the pills that have helped the most.
218 2018-12-28 23:37:27 i need . to give susie cbd oil for her effin anxiety
219 2018-12-28 23:37:25 Why do you say "little to no benefits" ? And yes, enabling for more mercury to get into water tables is mortgaging Americans' health.

Coal is dying because of natural gas, refinery oil, shale extraction / fracking. And also because of clean energy. It's 19th century tech.
220 2018-12-28 23:37:25 Trump wants the wall do2 there's oil and if u could drill on Texas land he'd be taking away jobs & keeping the Mexico people in their own country cuz of jobs our country will be overcrowded with immigrants because there r no jobs let them have jobs keep them in their own country
221 2018-12-28 23:37:05 Use virgin coconut oil like 5+ times daily legs, boobs, belly. I went through jars and brought it everywhere anytime you feel dry cake it on!
222 2018-12-28 23:37:00 That’s fair. Look what AB has done to their own province over the past 50 years. It will cost more than oil royalties earned throughout those years to clean those toxic tailing ponds up.
223 2018-12-28 23:36:50 CBD oil is where it’s at
224 2018-12-28 23:36:24 using a finger can leave the oil from your skin on the piece, that can lead to it not being archival or yellowing
225 2018-12-28 23:36:08 Good for you to raise a point on Fuel Price.

Fuel was subsidized in UPA1 and UPA2 era. Bills in billions not paid. 
Iran wasn't paid due to sanctions and UAE, SA, Iraq were give Oil bonds which matured in NDA post 2014. 
UPA wanted to use your tax money for repayment.
226 2018-12-28 23:36:06 Several oil execs giving maximum donations is not the same as receiving small donations from working class folks who happen to work for exxon.
227 2018-12-28 23:35:59 He voted to permit drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. He voted to allow the export of oil. He voted to speed up the export of natural gas.

230 2018-12-28 23:35:40 If anyone’s having a bad just know my little brother just had lecture me on the fact that i wasn’t keeping up my oil changes well enough and apparently I’m lucky my engine didn’t blow up on me
231 2018-12-28 23:35:39 Bought new sheets to match my weighted blanket and I already know I’m going to light every essential oil candle I own and melt into sleep when I go home and I can  not  wait 
232 2018-12-28 23:35:29 Nice. Oil is a little more challenging, I find (and thus more rewarding?). Your piece reminds me of driving across Ontario in a kinder season. 
233 2018-12-28 23:35:23 My current fave is olive oil roasted. 3 months after my daughter left for college she called in the middle of the day, "!!! you never call in the day, what's up?"  "I just wanted to tell you that now I like Brussel sprouts, bye!" Made my day.
234 2018-12-28 23:35:21 I LOVE this #recycling idea! Also: did you know wig companies sell hair they don't use to oil-spill clean-up companies to soak up oil? #whoknew! (I learned this today on @cbcradio's Doc Project. #WhereElse ?
235 2018-12-28 23:35:06 They're squeezing the Saudis to up oil production right now, using that dead journalist and other issues to leverage them, to help Trump, other reasons.
236 2018-12-28 23:35:03 You’re right! They think they’re going to be neglected, but they can make the best out of the situation. Leaders from that region can plan to develop the region to world class state bcuz is a small region now with University, Airport, and oil deposits.
237 2018-12-28 23:34:59 Hahahaha after all that watch out her hair oil is flammable. How’s she know? Kale is good friends with Leah so she does fit in now Jenalle on the other hand only has that kook David. Talk about flammable things how about his personality. Lol
238 2018-12-28 23:34:54 i just need somebody oil my scalp
239 2018-12-28 23:34:53 Painting with my new oil paints and canvas @ 8 shots tonight. High Tip of the night tonight will get the canvas painting! 
240 2018-12-28 23:34:44 Didn't Alberta get a big old bail out check? Oops I always mistake Alberta for big oil
241 2018-12-28 23:34:43 Lots of aircraft mechanics here and people who left oil. Can be trained easily. Just a few ideas for the future.
242 2018-12-28 23:34:41 I was given an essential oil diffuser for Christmas, (which I know nothing about) and went to buy some oils. The girl at the natural foods store disagrees, but I'm pretty sure "italian sausage" is essential.
243 2018-12-28 23:33:59 It’s crazy how smooth my car is after a fresh oil change
244 2018-12-28 23:33:56 Kaga benz dai
245 2018-12-28 23:33:53 I went to get an oil change & the company—whose name won’t be mentioned—messed up my vehicle...

They rented me a 2019 Toyota Rav 4 & are taking my vehicle to the dealer for repair. Could’ve been worse.
246 2018-12-28 23:33:36 Someone tell me why I got more excited about getting fish oil and multivitamin pills more than a pair of vans LOL
247 2018-12-28 23:33:22 Now we’re cooking with peanut oil baby yeah!!!
248 2018-12-28 23:33:16 Starting CBD oil today for pain management. I’m doubting I’ll feel any changes but I’ll keep all 2 of you updated 
249 2018-12-28 23:33:15 描いてる間にいくつか別の話も思いついてはいるので次は印刷所にお願いしたいもんです
250 2018-12-28 23:33:12 I had such a good day. I even forgot to take my CBD oil. But still had a good day. 
251 2018-12-28 23:33:00 I will make you a burek so greasy it will make your "virgin" olive oil not so virgin anymore
252 2018-12-28 23:32:49 I occasionally own E&Ps despite acknowledging that it really makes no sense.  You might as well just trade oil and gas prices, since they're the only thing that matter.
253 2018-12-28 23:32:47 In fairness Ben, they do.
A cursory check of WWII **training** accidents are staggering.
The "War for Oil" chant always made me weary - like it would be perfectly ok to cause energy blackmail and chaos. That's what the wars in the Middle East were about.
254 2018-12-28 23:32:33 It’s feels comfortable in a weird way, especially when you apply coconut oil, you wake up to a baby’s leg
255 2018-12-28 23:32:02 ugh tru but i just did some research and all the chocs in the celeb box use sustainable amounts of palm oil/have a no deforrestation rule they could just,, not include it sigh
256 2018-12-28 23:31:46 except it's not a smear. Bernie supporters are not the cultists that they are portrayed to be. I don't know of any Sanders supporter who thinks it's not okay for beto to take money from big oil who also think it's okay for Bernie to take money from gun manufacturers.
257 2018-12-28 23:31:38 He's also unapologetic for being meek the 10 years he sat in Ottawa and did nothing to help Alberta get the infrastructure it needs to get oil to tidewater.
258 2018-12-28 23:31:36 Need an oil change
259 2018-12-28 23:31:28 Another reason to invest in renewable energy. Reduce oil consumption and starve the middle east and Russian terror regimes.
260 2018-12-28 23:31:24 I need to clean it up and fill it with oil
261 2018-12-28 23:31:24 Yes bro listen to Charge it 2 tha Game by Silkk first
262 2018-12-28 23:31:15 eco is a go to for defined curls but it does not give me the sheen I love and it flakes and leaves my hair with an unnaturally crunchy texture . I use water and oil to combat that tho
263 2018-12-28 23:31:13 BS.

If you work for a gas station and donate to a campaign it is seen as belonging to the oil & gas corp even though you make a little above min wage. It is just how the FEC does things.

In Texas numerous types of jobs fall under that same issue.
264 2018-12-28 23:31:11 Try castor oil, hair oil, but Libya.
265 2018-12-28 23:31:10 @jordylancaster another shutdown party?
266 2018-12-28 23:31:10 Been in the car with j's dad for half an hour and he's already pissing me off. J told him we do our own oil change then he basically tells us we're too atupid to know how and to know what an oil wrench is. Okay well both my grandpa's are mechanics so like stfu.
267 2018-12-28 23:30:45 Fun fact I like to lather her butt cheeks in baby oil before I beat
268 2018-12-28 23:30:39 Imagine if Saudi Arabia weren’t given an ethical pass in foreign policy, because of their oil riches and buddying up to kushner? Imagine if they were seen and treated objectively? Would these flagrant abuses stand?
269 2018-12-28 23:30:38 Olive oil &amp; Mustard oil are the better ones, when it comes to cooking oil.
270 2018-12-28 23:30:35 Saw it yesterday. Called out so much of what many of us suspected was going in with Iraq and the oil. Definitely a worth watching film. Loved the looks on the faces of the republicans in the theatre afterwards. They looked like they just discovered Santa wasn’t real! Lol!
271 2018-12-28 23:30:24 I got an oil change, inspection, car wash, and vacuumed my car. Super productive day. #adulting
272 2018-12-28 23:30:13 I applaud President Trump bringing our troops home from Syria and Afghanistan.  It is time the oil rich nations for the Middle East paid for their own defense.
273 2018-12-28 23:30:12 Still not buying any fucking essential oil crap from her. Plus she's married now so what do I care.
274 2018-12-28 23:30:08 :’)) thank you I used the oil paint brush in procreate!!
275 2018-12-28 23:30:05 Oil
276 2018-12-28 23:29:52 not necessarily. But I do think it is fair to criticize that just like it's fair to point out that beto gets the money from big oil. I as a sanders supporter critical of Beto's record think bernie receiving that money is equally problematic (granted 10k vs 500K). Should return it
277 2018-12-28 23:29:50  Oil or acrylics?
278 2018-12-28 23:29:28 He had amazing foresight & helped transition us into energy independence so we don’t have to rely on foreign oil. Now we pick up where he left off & keep transitioning to greener energy. That’s called progression.
279 2018-12-28 23:29:14 Smh What about coconut oil
280 2018-12-28 23:29:08 Didn’t get an oil change but I did get fresh long stem roses.

282 2018-12-28 23:28:54 Hillary planned it after Qaddafi decided to drop the Petro$ for oil. Now Russia, Iran, Syria, have decided to follow suit. This is why the US has made them into enemies. It is a threat to the fiat USD.

286 2018-12-28 23:28:25 Answer: deposit of oil, gas and minerals located in Afghanistan. In addition, the war that goes on forever there is a real gold bull for armaments and banks .
287 2018-12-28 23:28:24 I prefer it with nothing on it. It has natural salt and pepper flavor together. But if you need something, I’d recommend a tiny bit of fresh lemon juice emulsified with olive oil.

291 2018-12-28 23:27:50 Which wouldn’t exist without the government building the GPS system. They do amazing things but capitalism didn’t make it, only exploited it. (Which maybe is like saying refineries should get no credit for turning oil into gasoline. Hm.)
292 2018-12-28 23:27:46 3/ With the crash (which was not controlled by Notley or Trudeau, not matter how often Conservatives try to claim it is), oil companies and governments finally started to realize that they SHOULD have diversified their markets, but they didn't. 
To place all the blame on the
293 2018-12-28 23:27:33 My husband. HE pressured me into making homemade mayonnaise last might, now HE'S bitching that all the olive oil is gone. Well fuck off then.
294 2018-12-28 23:27:15 check some statistics and you will find that legal immigrants and illegal alien border jumpers send billions each year. estimated to be the third largest income source to Mehico behind oil and tourism..
295 2018-12-28 23:26:56 Just woke up. Why I have an oil in my face. This is really sht
296 2018-12-28 23:26:53 全てが……
297 2018-12-28 23:26:48 Just a new gasket for the oil pan and a drain plug should only cost like 20-30 bucks.
298 2018-12-28 23:26:47 2/ why would oil companies increase production in Alberta, when there are no other markets to ship to? 
Conservatives and oil companies failed, in that they did not push for pipelines to new markets long ago. They thought the discount market to the US would always be good enough.
299 2018-12-28 23:26:43 No olive oil or balsamic?
300 2018-12-28 23:26:34 She looks like an oil painting my god
301 2018-12-28 23:26:33 you see, me and my crazy self has a theory about that. watch how it was those people who wanna promote not using palm oil so to make up for it, they promote coconut/coconut oil based products as a replacement...to supposedly save the environment
302 2018-12-28 23:26:33 Nah changing my oil
303 2018-12-28 23:26:27 Wonder how much bunker oil that yacht burns per mile. Probably makes Elon's Gulfstream look frugal.
304 2018-12-28 23:26:17 Jesus H Christ put down the weed.
305 2018-12-28 23:26:12 This entire spat started over @davidsirota linking to a list of candidates who received the most oil money this year. That 1) has nothing to do with Bernie himself and 2) is entirely about policies and values. Why are you commenting when you clearly don't know what's happening?
306 2018-12-28 23:25:57 USA can take all the oil from Venezuela if they help us to be free of communist...nowdays Cuba, China, Russia & @CARICOMorg are stolen all our mineral from our country
307 2018-12-28 23:25:54 I see none of those. You have shown me a fake graph that I disproved. You hae fake scientists fundedd by oil industry front groups. You hae shown you dont understnad what the ipcc is. It has zero policies. Climate change threatens the poor more.
308 2018-12-28 23:25:43 You drive? Brush your teeth? Sit on a toilet seat? Well...if you said yes to any of those...then we're not getting off oil anytime soon.
309 2018-12-28 23:25:32 At this point it’s every solution on the table should be looked at.  I’ve read they have a proposed plan to build a petroleum reserve that would store large amounts of oil for when prices go down they can store some oil until prices go up.
310 2018-12-28 23:25:24 Activists always scream “big oil”, but their funding is always up to par.  There is nothing grassroots or moral about the “green” movement.
311 2018-12-28 23:25:13 The article failed to mention that the vast majority of that money came from employees of the oil and gas industry (the biggest industry in Texas), that Beto didn’t take ANY money from pacs, and that the oil and gas money was less than 1% of all money raised. Seems relevant, no?
312 2018-12-28 23:25:11 Makes LOTS OF SENSE to me for Beto to vote with the economic interests of middle of the road Texans (i.e. for Oil and Gas) when he's about to seek election as a US Senator from Texas... 

Hey @davidsirota wouldn't you have wanted him to beat Cruz??? smh

Says nada about his views

315 2018-12-28 23:24:49 I was just thinking of this the last hour, after I got off Twitter. I was just thinking, what if Lampert planned this all along? I actually thought, is this a new snake-oil-con technique of these billionaire investors? The long-play con? It's happened too many times now.

318 2018-12-28 23:24:35 When you Americans stop fracking your brains out, I will stop advocating for pipelines to get Alberta oil to market
319 2018-12-28 23:24:14 People can't serve two God's!  The light of love, or money..  Humanity itself, or the carrot of greed soaked want!  Fascism feeds on weakened people! The Repub's have been running a long con, or hostile take over of America, and the world at large!  You will worship oil, or die..
320 2018-12-28 23:24:14 Putin has hooked up w/ Xi, for some time, Xi just placed largest oil order w/ Saudi, as an expert in security what would you have done to slow or cripple this alliance? Can it even be done?  I see press for fossile fuel foolhardy & Saudi reserves may not be as claimed?
321 2018-12-28 23:24:13 @adamthomas21 just seen your #instagram story about your dogs skin....try coconut oil in your dogs food daily!! Just a small amount
322 2018-12-28 23:23:51 Turns out he needed me to oil his back before our match, I thought it was a rib but i shut my mouth did what I was told lol. He then proceeded to lead me through a great first match took awesome care of me in the ring. Great guy #dontforgetmychestkid

328 2018-12-28 23:22:35 It’s the oil but it’s much more than that. We’ve ceded meaningful influence in a turbulent region and provided our adversaries (Russia, Iran) with a huge geopolitical windfall.
329 2018-12-28 23:22:29 *orders beard oil
330 2018-12-28 23:22:20 How much oil money is fueling this committee, I wonder?
331 2018-12-28 23:22:18 I’m the ashiest person on earth. I use lotion and coconut oil AND Vaseline and I still end up ashy 40 minutes later
332 2018-12-28 23:22:05 Iran is buddies with Putin so unlikely they will be invaded. Corporate types and some governments want the oil Iran has, so someday it will likely be an issue. Only thing that might change that is if North Korea and Iran start exchanging nuclear info, materials etc again.
333 2018-12-28 23:21:53 Was hittin my oil pen at the blue line and I had my ear buds in at full volume so I didn’t hear the train coming down at full speed so when it passed me I lost my equilibrium and almost fell

337 2018-12-28 23:21:40 @UPSHelp I would like to know how I can make a complaint on the drive that just dropped an expensive pump for my oil boiler on our front cement door step area. I heard this huge thump at the door opened it up my package was there an delivery drive walking away.. with not a care
338 2018-12-28 23:21:25 You don't think the server issue is a violation of federal statute and law? Or Russian oil scandal? If you or i would have done those thing, we would have been in jail yesterday. All politician look after each other's back. That is why no one is in jail even McCabe.
339 2018-12-28 23:21:25 Reid is just a snake oil salesman, clutching at the straws of hate and division. That's how she makes her $.
340 2018-12-28 23:21:23 If you mind me asking, what specifically are you basing your opinion that he has a, “close friendship with business, oil?”
341 2018-12-28 23:21:10 Have you ever won 143% in a single year like Eric @ericnuttall

347 2018-12-28 23:20:52 If you knew how much it costs for a lambo you would think  differently lol not only is it a expensive by you also have to pay on it yearly to the government aid oil change can cost $2,000 a simple scratch to be replaced you're looking at $60,000 they're not really worth it
348 2018-12-28 23:20:32 Is it true Saudi Arabia will not accept the American dollar as payment for oil anymore.And they will only except gold as payment.
349 2018-12-28 23:20:09 I am a Liberal-at-heart Eric but I am contemplating abandoning my party of choice to become politically independent if @JustinTrudeau cannot get the #TransMountain pipeline done.  #ableg

He does what he says and produces results, 2020 is a lock. He doesn't, he loses.
351 2018-12-28 23:19:58 @ntb - Lyra Dr, Columbus OH used predatory sales tactics on my 22 y/o daughter confusing/convincing her she needed $350 in brake work when she went for oil change.   Then mgr (Jim) and corp cust service followed the age-old best practice - blame cust for not being knowledgeable.

359 2018-12-28 23:18:01 He also repeatedly violated a pledge by taking this money. It's a bad look for a presidential candidate who lies to gain progressive clout, then takes multiple maxed-out donations from oil execs. Entirely unscrupulous and unacceptable considering the impending climate catastrophe

368 2018-12-28 23:16:34 Not if you keep allowing oil and gas production and long term infrastructure investment to increase.  That isn't working together.  You are locking us into the wrong path. #cdnpoli
369 2018-12-28 23:16:33 Take #1 D away from any bubble team. No ones say Oil are upper echelon of NHL but as a bubble team health is crucial. Not to mention EDM is actually down 3 of top 4. Russel, Klefbom, Sekera.
370 2018-12-28 23:16:31 City States are a terrible idea for the future. Think about a future where DFW, Houston, Austin and San Antonio are all separate city states fighting for the wind farms and oil of West Texas. Well...Houston would be fighting with NOLA for the Gulf fisheries and oil there.

Let the United Nations take care of them. Oh my bad. They only send humanitarian aid to places that has resources like oil,gold etc.

Change my mind, patrician. 
381 2018-12-28 23:14:44 The secret is to stir fry the noodles and beef in the now garlic-infused oil you crisped your garlic slices in. It's so, so good!
382 2018-12-28 23:14:36 Dan, who do you think is behind currency bombing in Venezuela & similar disasters in Africa = all cases where massive oil reserves exist?
383 2018-12-28 23:14:25 Solar panel prices are high because of trump’s ridiculous tariffs, windmills just need some wind, natural gas prices fluctuate just like oil. Just because something is cheap does not make it the best option.
384 2018-12-28 23:14:20 I once went so long between oil changes that the service guy asked me why I took the oil out before i drove it in
385 2018-12-28 23:14:18 I worked on the Exxon Valdez oil spill.  Does that count as hurting or helping?
386 2018-12-28 23:13:56 I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt, but when I discovered that he was a Jungian with no understanding of Jung, a commentator on the Bible with no knowledge of its nature, and a slave of natural law who denies nature,I began to wonder.
Snake oil for the credulous. 
387 2018-12-28 23:13:54 These increased demand numbers come from oil profiteers trying to promote pipes, if you do your own research you will find that most big market countries will be totally renewable energy within a decade or so. VW phase out IC engines in a decade.... etc etc. Read.
388 2018-12-28 23:13:23 John Roberts? Cant get any higher than that.

391 2018-12-28 23:12:54 Just a sad bitch who needs an oil change
392 2018-12-28 23:12:29 Yes, they've tried to rationalize it away. I remember "of course he took tons of oil money, he lives in Texas!" and "he took lots of money from various other industries, too!".

There's a reason they stopped trying to refute it. Their only defenses were even more embarrassing.
393 2018-12-28 23:12:26 Nope ! I would just twist up my top portion and oil my sides and tie them . In the morning I would fluff and sponge but I hated the manipulation so I got braids . I def recommend you keep a taper! Find a dope male barber bc girls be BSn

397 2018-12-28 23:11:53 I ain’t change the engine oil since like May, one of the back light is out but I got the police card so cops leave me alone, I gotta turn the wheel slightly to the right to keep the car straight at all times, my passenger door doesn’t open from the inside and the engine overheats
398 2018-12-28 23:11:52 Cbd oil and cannabis products all around including lamps, fertilizer, drain systems. It’s an entire industry that’s been untapped
399 2018-12-28 23:11:51 Did you read that article?

 It doesn't say he's owned, it does say he voted with a block of pro oil Democrats on a few laws in a manner most dems did not. It looks into a lot else aside from oil.
400 2018-12-28 23:11:29 yes but i do also have to make mine without actua garlic (only garlic oil) since garlic makes my intestines Angry
401 2018-12-28 23:11:22 Lmao
@OgbeniDipo 

Bros i get your passion, but that na better suicide mission. 

Lack of Institutions ensure that bad things in  are exploited or metamorphose into a Cartel/Racket.

Oil Bunkering, Kidnapping , Boko-Haram 

What has been the Army's budget over the last decade?
402 2018-12-28 23:11:22 Tea tree oil is so good to me
403 2018-12-28 23:11:22 DELETE ALL THE FOLLOWING...DELETE.. The TimeBoys are baffled by oil rigs!
404 2018-12-28 23:11:12 The best part of being in Youngstown is going to dinner and eating greens and cheese/hot peppers in oil/wedding soup. 
405 2018-12-28 23:11:04 i have snacks on deck, hot cocoa, heated blanket, a gram of oil, new wifi router, house to myself..... i feel.... blessed.....
406 2018-12-28 23:10:46 When Nigeria was indeed Nigeria.........And the discovery of Oil changed everything.
407 2018-12-28 23:10:46 We have an election coming up this year and the most important issues are THE OIL PATCH and PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION.  I hope that one Party will pick up on these and RUN WITH THEM.

410 2018-12-28 23:10:23 Please post that article where Sirota implied falsely that Beto owned big oil money.
411 2018-12-28 23:10:22 Sqaulene? Is it a kind of oil or cream? Never heard of it. Where can you get it?
412 2018-12-28 23:10:21 They are great for New England Baked Beans. Better than a beanpot (my slow cooker has a ceramic inside that's just like one). If you're not into meat use oil instead of pork/bacon/salt pork and it comes out beautiful. Now if I could get the gumption to bake NE Brown Bread...
413 2018-12-28 23:10:15 The Liberals do not control the price of oil! Low oil prices are killing Estevan. Keep peddling your Conservative BS!
414 2018-12-28 23:10:13 サラダ油に流されて変わってゆく私をあなたは時々遠くで叱って。
415 2018-12-28 23:10:03 Looking at info structures such as waste line .Area Food industerial agricultural food chains.
It takes 400 dams to make nuke power plant.
Just in oil leak in ocean.

416 2018-12-28 23:09:52 Thank God for $30 oil changes
417 2018-12-28 23:09:46 So you do know that oil prices are driven by global trends, right?  On the bright side, I look forward to your taking credit for rising prices in the near future!
418 2018-12-28 23:09:45  I've been moisturising mine but ain't doing Jack, need some coconut oil 
419 2018-12-28 23:09:45 I won't disagree with that, particularly if Kenney is basing it on oil going back to what it was priced at in the "good old days".  I don't think we will ever see those days again.  There r ways to make the economy more diverse, I just don't think any politicians are looking hard
420 2018-12-28 23:09:32 What relevant and useful context are you talking about?  He's not for a green new deal and he gets money from big oil. Just a coincidence?
421 2018-12-28 23:09:32 A little olive oil? We used to rub olive oil in our hands and then sort of massage him so it got all through his fur. I suppose a cat would lick it all off, but it might still do some good taken internally?
422 2018-12-28 23:09:29 I got some lavender, sage n eucalyptus oil blend while I face > shit fire
423 2018-12-28 23:09:22 Really?? Harper was a disaster  & @JustinTrudeau,  @cathmckenna are doing the same - promise action & instead continue oil subsidies & buying a pipeline! Libs lied last election & are trying to peddle the same lies again!Vote @CanadianGreens for minority gov't. @ElizabethMay
424 2018-12-28 23:09:22 LoL I read online that they don’t like the smell of peppermint . I poured peppermint oil on paper towels and stuffed the gap in the screen 
425 2018-12-28 23:09:08 It didn't imply he was owned by big oil. It just pointed out that he was second to Cruz in oil money. A follow up article pointed out how his voting record aligned with Republicans and Trump on many issues. We need journalists that are willing to critique politicians.
426 2018-12-28 23:09:08 Oily skin is oily because it needs moisture. Your skin is in overdrive trying to correct the moisture problem thus oil glands producing excess oil. Matte primer on oily skin is not good unless you excessively moisturize lol
427 2018-12-28 23:09:06 I put very little olive oil in fry pan. 
...15 mins each side.
428 2018-12-28 23:09:06 You have a source for that? Because it sounds pretty insane.
429 2018-12-28 23:09:01 Cabot Oil $COG another 25,000 January $24 calls being bought today for $0.50 to $0.60 as some $25 calls adjust back, spot where 10,000 opened yesterday

431 2018-12-28 23:08:22 One more question.. did Modi govt reduce any taxes on oil to take credit for reduction in oil prices? No.. prices come down because of low raw material cost.. 
Additionally only favor Modi deed was not to increase the taxes further.. -: P

Many pretend they're just playing Twisted - I firmly beg to differ such denials.
435 2018-12-28 23:07:38 A quick: Vaseline is bad for your hair and skin, any type of oil will do (olive oil is good for skin so I advise it, so you can also use any type of hair cream to do this as well)
436 2018-12-28 23:07:23 @drvox do you know if anyone has explored brute force carbon sequestration, for example purpose built lagoons for growing algae that is then skimmed off, partially dried, and dropped into abandoned oil wells and deep mine shafts?

440 2018-12-28 23:06:48 Coconut oil usually helps me a whole lot
441 2018-12-28 23:06:47 Funny that; just pulled these out of the oil.
442 2018-12-28 23:06:43 palmer’s haircare products actually bang for the price tag - the coconut oil line specifically
443 2018-12-28 23:06:37 Bergamot oil smells great.

445 2018-12-28 23:06:22 Lol. Thibs just changed the oil on Derrick Rose for the first time in 2 years, & that’s why he’s ok again
446 2018-12-28 23:05:46 I was just finna say that. When my hair got to the length where its likee long enough to grip but not tapered I would just oil that shit and tie it up. It was hella annoying But if you dont plan on grow it back def cut it ! I see what you mean !
447 2018-12-28 23:05:38 Imagine Trump having some border-Venezuelans to tea at the White House after their currency wiped out despite Venezuela having worlds richest oil reserves.
448 2018-12-28 23:05:34 Dismiss it as a ‘demand for perfection ,’ if by “perfection “ you mean “trustworthy.”  I’m nit at the point of trusting Beto, with his close friendship with business,oil, and the like. That’s all. Just a matter of simple, basic - if not 100% perfect - Trust
449 2018-12-28 23:05:33 Eyes looked at the oil being poured. "You brought this everywhere you go?" He made a small laugh and gently smiled. Fingers brushed each other to allow the oil spread evenly. "Come closer."

451 2018-12-28 23:05:16 @guarnaschelli I dont understand the hatred for truffle oil.  Major great restaurants like Capital Grill use it and it's super popular @GuyFieri seems to love it when used on DDD.

453 2018-12-28 23:05:01 Falling International oil prices had absolutely nothing to do with lower prices in Ontario? When will the Premeir withdraw / reduce provincial excise taxes so that we don’t pay a ONT tax on a ONT excise tax?
454 2018-12-28 23:04:58 i always have to oc oil my hair
455 2018-12-28 23:04:53 Agreed! Like, why TF are we still paying oil companies subsidies?
456 2018-12-28 23:04:32 "Tar" sands?? Tar is a derivative of coal. Tar is not made from oil.

Ohhh, you mean the Oil Sands where they are cleaning up a "natural" oil spill.....
457 2018-12-28 23:04:31 Maybe a bounce in short term, but sure does seem like it wants to go lower.... Like everything in the markets we will know in due time. Trump wasn't shy about advertising how he wanted low oil "much lower" oil prices. Thanks for the insight!
458 2018-12-28 23:04:30 Me and the homies giving each other oil changes all 2019
459 2018-12-28 23:04:30 Buying an oil diffuser is the best thing you could do. 
460 2018-12-28 23:04:27 Where are you from wigger? Have you ever stepped foot on an oil or gas lease or worked in the industry? Alberta has some of the highest environmental standards in the world.
461 2018-12-28 23:04:15 I'd like to know who the beneficiaries of gippsland oil fields are. seems to me that east timor espionage, witnessK. people like hugh morgan RBA BCA woodside trilateral commission, lafarge intl paying ISIS 'to do business' west papua are connected.. was it concrete for tunnels?
462 2018-12-28 23:04:11 So to recap: Oil Baron gives presidential campaign piles of cash in return for a to-do list when they win, to-do list includes policies/deregulations which are 100% known to harm US citizens. That about right? My questions, obviously unethical, Is this legal? Who/How to stop it?
463 2018-12-28 23:04:10 I cleared my head by applying two coats of oil to my back deck yesterday. As my psychology professor said “back in my day mindfulness was called doing stuff.” 
464 2018-12-28 23:03:57 Jesus didn’t save mankind, CBD oil did
465 2018-12-28 23:03:31 あいりんさんかわいいw
466 2018-12-28 23:03:26 There is less disposable cash flow in Alberta's economy due to the market price of crude oil.  Full stop.  Anybody that insists differently is pulling the wool over your eyes.
467 2018-12-28 23:03:21 never put peppermint oil in ur bath ok one time i was unreasonably stoned and wanted to take a bath but also it was rlly hot in my apartment so i put peppermint oil in it and was simultanously scalding and freezing at the same time & i didnt kno what to do
468 2018-12-28 23:03:14 Why are they all bald too?

469 2018-12-28 23:03:08 Getting my new car it’s first tire rotation and oil change. They grow up so fast 
470 2018-12-28 23:02:42 why are you up this late ma'am
471 2018-12-28 23:02:27 Butter has many health benefits as does olive oil.  We need saturated fat in our diet along with the other types of fat to help deal effectively with inflammation.  Without saturated fats, we simply cannot deal with inflammation.  It’s how our body is made to work.
472 2018-12-28 23:02:26 Bumper hanging on for dear life, high beams don’t work, charger doesn’t work, radio doesn’t work, side mirror broke so I have to use tape just to keep it on, plus the glass is broken.

473 2018-12-28 23:02:21 Venezuela's currency is pegged by proxy to the usd. It is reliant on the dollar to refine its heavy oil. It always needs to obtain $ regardless of its internal fiscal policy. It is therefore beholden to credit ratings and cannot over stretch its bolivar.
474 2018-12-28 23:02:19 Rodney seems to like burning the late night oil. But Del seems to be an early to bed sort of lass. I'll keep you up to speed.
475 2018-12-28 23:02:17 There's many.. do a search for Keto 101.
High (good) fat, low carb.
Under 50 carbs/day.
When I discovered my AM mocha had 47grams of carbs PER CUP OF CHOC MILK, I almost fell over. 
Now I use heavy cream, butter and cocoa nut oil, emulsify with shots of coffee..
Life changing!!
476 2018-12-28 23:02:13 The price was artificial to begin with. Last month I listened to the same news bulletin saying petrol is going down, then next it said crude oil has gone up and I knew this whole thing is a fallacy. CR wants us to be enthralled by his fake fuel reductions.
477 2018-12-28 23:02:03 CBD oil on chocolate tastes so much like a weed brownie, even if it doesn’t get you high

483 2018-12-28 23:01:19 Aw shit, sorry to hear that man. I got out of 20 years in the service industry to get on operating with oil companies and have been lucky so far. I’m rooting for ya’, unlike certain unsympathetic people. Protests have happened here in Sk. where I work. Keep it up! Ciao.
484 2018-12-28 23:01:18 As a manager who investigates workplace accidents in the oil and gas industry I am as skeptical as they come. I deal with facts over fiction on a daily basis. I can only comment on what facts have been presented. Opinions based on anything but facts is just a waste of my time.
485 2018-12-28 23:01:16 Why are you not taking credit for falling oil prices? Your dictator takes credit for everything else, why don't you tell us how you are personally responsible for the worlds oil price.
486 2018-12-28 23:01:15 Oh shit the part in good will hunting where it's pre-9/11 but will's talking about infiltrating middle eastern countries under the guise of defeating a rebel army to push oil prices down lol

492 2018-12-28 23:00:22 Also the Democrats said the money is going to a religion's aids for food to the poor peoples I not see the money is use on that way.
I was in Peru in a town call Talara was built for a oil company years ago, the streets was called Park because was green space between the houses

499 2018-12-28 22:59:39 Why does getting an oil change have to be such a hassle 
500 2018-12-28 22:59:38 In a world where oil is going to become much less valuable in the face of existential pressure, the ME is going to become of far less strategic importance. And to think Russia, which has no economy beyond oil and no geopolitical reach anywhere could dominate the ME is lib fantasy

508 2018-12-28 22:58:29 I use this too! But it’s the green one, and it’s sooooo nice. I’d also look into the Pond’s brand, I’ve heard good things about them. Face oil also helps, like rosehip, Moroccan, and I think tea tree too

Also.Bernie took NRA money. Has done nothing in 20 years in the Senate.
516 2018-12-28 22:57:39 No ceo's of the oil industry maxing out at tens of thousands of dollars is. But that doesn't matter when his voting record reveals more about the type of politician he is.
517 2018-12-28 22:57:36 And close the border.  We need to seal the border with Mexico until this problem is brought under control.
518 2018-12-28 22:57:14 The nuclear "industry" has been controlled by "texas oil" for 60 years.  I'm old enough to realize how many lives have been wasted.  I sleep well knowing that payback is a bitch, and I'm going to see it in my lifetime.

533 2018-12-28 22:55:47 There’s no comparison between Ferguson and Pochettino. Ferguson was outspending the league before the oil money arrived. When Stam left they went and paid a fortune in salary to Laurent Blanc.
534 2018-12-28 22:55:39 sell your family's investments in companies (oil, gas...) that are contributing to U.S./global climate crisis then, & only then, can/will you be taken seriously

536 2018-12-28 22:55:03 Someone take my Jeep to get an oil change plz :(
537 2018-12-28 22:54:53 Whilst I don't dispute your sentiment, I think there are more relevant comparisons to be made to Scotland. Yes, Ireland is independent and clearly makes its own way in the EU but Norway gained indy from Sweden many years ago and has an oil based economy so more appropriate?
538 2018-12-28 22:54:50 Lmao, 5 years is a lot of time to harness gains, but I swear it can be ruined in 1 day when power changes... same happened to Ontario Oil when Jonathan left...
539 2018-12-28 22:54:50 2.  profits on wall st while wages stagnant and no strengthening of unions, opening the Arctic to oil drilling twice, & the most US oil & gas production is US history,record deportations, nothing substantial on black inequality,the assassination of a 16 yr old US citizen w/ a
540 2018-12-28 22:54:46 Literally about to die by the amount of tea tree oil I just accidentally put in my bath water
541 2018-12-28 22:54:40 U head get oil..
542 2018-12-28 22:54:36 we have this place where I live that sells not just the Oil but CBD candles where you can rub the wax on your skin and it's great for stress relief. check out earthbound sometime.
543 2018-12-28 22:54:31 Standard Oil saved the whales!
544 2018-12-28 22:54:30 Ha ha, it would be great entertainment. I don’t have the time, have a nice, well paying job in the oil patch to attend to. I’m sure these morons think I’m out there spilling oil (that’s an issue for another day) as opposed to preventing that from happening.Keep up the good fight.
545 2018-12-28 22:54:27 Norway invests a small % of the tax take on its oil in its sovereign wealth fund. Hth.
546 2018-12-28 22:54:26 He's still getting financial contributions from oil executives.  That's dirty money.
547 2018-12-28 22:54:26 That's sick getting rich thru cheriity but look at all those American Evagelists? Swaggert...Graham etc... they just hide behind 'God' :/ all snake oil salesmen

549 2018-12-28 22:54:21 An economy that could not survive without assistance from Westminster. The SNPs response has always been once they get their hands on the oil they can make it work....it can’t you numpty.
550 2018-12-28 22:54:17 MYYYYY ESSENTIAL OIL DIFFUSER IS HERE words can’t explain how happy I am
551 2018-12-28 22:54:03 In sure I heard police oil but no idea why that would work,I suggest u Google it x

Very soon you'll say Tinubu is 4rm Togo #omo ode#
553 2018-12-28 22:53:48 same, i wanna move onto CBD oil papers
554 2018-12-28 22:53:45 A few months cannot be extrapolated to the next two decades, as you're implying, and you avoided my points #2 and #3, unsurprisingly. The truth is that oil demand will peak in 2021/22. Get ready.
555 2018-12-28 22:53:40 My feeling is that if a government were to do any one thing (eg a high carbon tax, ending fossil fuel subsidies, phase out oil and gas) at the level we probably need,  they would then need to make further big interventions to cope with the side effects.
556 2018-12-28 22:53:26 Horse meat? Contaminated eggs, anti freeze in wine, more olive oil produced than there are trees to produce it (so what are you buying?) Bushmeat arriving daily. And there's more chlorine on washed UK and EU salads than on US chicken. But, you just wander along with your blinkers
557 2018-12-28 22:53:21 Great Win! 
558 2018-12-28 22:53:11 The bet against the oil lobbies, the enterprise to go to Mars and all the other devilries...I'will remembered  the dreamer @elonmusk to my Grandchildren
559 2018-12-28 22:52:59 So you and your fat head when out onto the world and lowered oil prices right!? So cheap gas, what are you saying, we should drive more, create more pollution?!

BJP govt under PM Modi has inaugurated the Paradip Oil Refinery & laid the foundation of Paradip- Hyderabad pipeline of Indian Oil Corp which will not only strengthen Odisha’s energy sector but will also boost employment & investment in the region

568 2018-12-28 22:52:05 Beta O’Rourke has sold out to big oil and corporate influence.  That won’t change overnight.  No way
569 2018-12-28 22:52:02 Loss of health. productivity - and  loss of life is much more costly than controlling mercury and other toxic emissions from coal and oil fired power plants. (Statistics show many more children and adults will develop asthma and other lung and serious health conditions).
570 2018-12-28 22:51:43 just the very thought of shoving a tampon soaked in essential oil up my vagina to "cure" my endo makes the hellfire burn
571 2018-12-28 22:51:38 No one is moving to electric cars... alternative fuel for internal combustion engines is a better choice, but big oil will never let it happen...
572 2018-12-28 22:51:34 I need a carwash and oil change bad
573 2018-12-28 22:51:29 That being said that doesn't mean you reject the science of climate change and refuse to continue to invest in renewable energy, energy storage, and electrification, all of which O'Rourke supports. I happen to think most people hold that position of weaning ourselves off oil.
574 2018-12-28 22:51:28 You must keep the oil industry and their money, their lobbyists, their bought and paid for House Reps out of the conversation.  If you let them participate,  we will know that you take this action in complete bad faith.
575 2018-12-28 22:51:25 So what, the rest of us we weren’t polled we were working as cowboys, oil field workers,fishermen, policemen and soldiers.

581 2018-12-28 22:50:42 You'd give up your life in the service of something greater than yourself? How horrible!

Why yes, we should sacrifice another crop of 18 year old boys for oil.
582 2018-12-28 22:50:17 I read your post, kept scrolling then I had to come back and reread it. Damn Trump Is a slick MFer.  Slick as an opened can of oil.

585 2018-12-28 22:49:56 There are a lot of people expecting solar to replace fossil fuel for everything.  Do you happen to know how many heating BTU in Ontario are used daily to heat homes and businesses that do so with some form of fossil fuels (oil, NG, propane, etc) and we can compute solar needed?
586 2018-12-28 22:49:34 Bio oil 
587 2018-12-28 22:49:32 THAT is called enabling bullshit. 
Anyone paying attention recognized Trump as the greedy fucking snake oil salesman he was AND recognized that Hillary would have been better for the disenfranchised than Trump would be. 

Choosing the best of the choice we have... not a fantasy.
588 2018-12-28 22:49:26 if I go one more day without an oil change I'm gonna spray my load all over the fucking parking lot

598 2018-12-28 22:48:28 They banned the plastic bag. They banned wood burning stoves and fireplaces. Now they're considering banning oil furnaces. Why don't they fix the roads. Salt the streets when they're supposed to and control the exorbitant cost of city hall. The province and the city are corrupt.

602 2018-12-28 22:47:56 Other Caribbean countries do not have oil and do not belong to OPEC .First Chavez and then Maduro has billions of $$ in Panama from oil revenues while it's people are dying of Starvation . Who fault it is ?? The United States ??
603 2018-12-28 22:47:49 Ion know but it sholl make a lot of noises and I need a oil change 
604 2018-12-28 22:47:41 To you. They might be able to afford the bus vs a regular oil change, rotation and other car maintenance. Sounds like priorities are ok to me.

617 2018-12-28 22:46:27 @seanhannity  Your guest talking about coconut oil is wrong. Coconut oil is the only oil that does not oxidize. @JGilliam_SEAL  It is the best oil.  Oil are necessary for brain health NOT OMEGA 6 OILS like corn, veg, canola.  I have a health supplement store and she is wrong.
618 2018-12-28 22:46:23 Yeah that's the truth but I got a feeling I'm going to get in trouble a lot for playing with the oil filter cap wrenches instead of working

625 2018-12-28 22:45:44 Yeah, but here in the real world:
- airports serve large population bases
- that drives traffic and pays for the cost of building the airport
- commodities (esp. forestry and oil) do not travel by air
Your idea is your idea. It just isn’t supported by economics.

658 2018-12-28 22:41:47 What’s with the lies coming from PC government these days? Stop bragging about the lower gas prices. The global crude oil prices are lower which results in lower fuel prices.
In the US they are paying less than $2.00 per gallon, are you telling us you lowered their prices too???
659 2018-12-28 22:41:32 Never knew a oil change can take this fucking long damn
660 2018-12-28 22:41:23 Duchy Knockoffs cost a tenth of the price and have only slightly more saturated brake oil in the pastry. Bargain. And no false insinuations regarding preferment.

662 2018-12-28 22:41:05 Can’t say I’m happy, but they did offer me a 5 year warrenty on the trans +Free oil changes. I’ll be sure to bring it in for service throughout the plan for monitoring and maintance.

669 2018-12-28 22:40:38 Was the family business building the oil infrastructure for Nazi Germany an op too?
670 2018-12-28 22:40:35 If our oil is Under 20:00 bucks a bbl why are we paying 6 bucks a gallon
671 2018-12-28 22:40:30 you aren't a true van gogh fan if u don't regularly chug bottles of sunflower oil to honour him
672 2018-12-28 22:40:29 The art of the snake oil salesman.
673 2018-12-28 22:40:26 U have to wean gradually of oil dependency or entire economies will collapse. U cant have a knee jerk reaction to this.
674 2018-12-28 22:40:24 Yes that's right they're doing an off market buy back and offering a special divi of $1 US per share. Spec divi was announced on 17 Dec. Probably would have been some smart buying on the announcement of the sale of onshore oil/gas US assets $10.5B. Was announced 31 Oct '18

679 2018-12-28 22:39:59 Tom just walked into my house, came into my room, and went off about renewable resource and big oil companies. I’m just trying to paint my nails.
680 2018-12-28 22:39:56 Que oil at #PrettyNastyTonight would go crazy
681 2018-12-28 22:39:52 ありがとうございます！
682 2018-12-28 22:39:52 Eagle - thx for all your charts - love em.  what will be your signal to go long on oil?
683 2018-12-28 22:39:51 It seems that both nations are craving higher oil prices now and relying on the OPEC+ cut to achieve that. The wildcard here is US oil production, but something tells me that they'll have to scale back a bit too because these prices are a disservice to themselves. Look at Canada.
684 2018-12-28 22:39:47 @LionelMedia @csthetruth @BillClinton @LauraLoomer  Omar?  Omar Mateen, the gunman who fatally shot 49 people at The Pulse night club, appeared in a BP oil spill documentary according to USA Today.  So he's already was a blip in Big Media like Lee Oswald ... #RedPillBill 
685 2018-12-28 22:39:44 WFAN must be treating you well...a regular sub there ends up costing at least 10 bucks...also love the “You want it Mike’s way?”...like Mike invented oil, vinegar and oregano on a sub.
686 2018-12-28 22:39:32 My daughter is having way too much fun having me say “toilet” and “oil”. Apparently I say them wrong. 
687 2018-12-28 22:39:22 Poor music, questionable clothing styles & an oil crisis.
688 2018-12-28 22:39:13 Such a chilled little spot. Crispy calamari with Parmesan and truffle oil on fries. It was delicious!
689 2018-12-28 22:39:06 Maris Piper, nothing else. Par boil for 6-8 mins max. Meanwhile, heat a good 3 inches of vege oil in a roasting tray at 220 degrees. Drain potatoes and let them steam dry. Add to oil - they should spit and sizzle. Salt. Roast for 45 mins-ish till CRISPY. Turn half way.
690 2018-12-28 22:38:44 Our entire cture revolves around fossil fuels. It took over 100 years for us to switch from whale oil to coal and oil and they didnt have the massive transportation issue we have today
691 2018-12-28 22:38:43 I just remembered at Primary School we did Hymn Practice every morning and I’m howling with laughter  there were some proper bangers in there though “Give me oil in my lamp, keep me burning...”

693 2018-12-28 22:38:29 CONGRATULATIONS 
Cecilia Elsbernd !  
You won a FREE oil change in our monthly drawing !
694 2018-12-28 22:38:13 I’d recommend something with Arian oil to help with the frizziness. I’ve always got on well with Elvive rather than super expensive  stuff.

696 2018-12-28 22:38:11 Step father: go to Valvoline for your oil change it’s the same price as prompto. 

Valvoline: “that’ll be $54.99 for your oil change today.” 


697 2018-12-28 22:38:04 What was the last oil you used and why?
698 2018-12-28 22:37:46 Read more about the science of climate change & realize how dire our situation is, then talk to us about offshore oil drilling again. Don’t you want a future?
699 2018-12-28 22:37:39 At the dealership getting an oil change and this old couple in the waiting area keep arguing and talking about everything going wrong in the local news
700 2018-12-28 22:37:36 gouache was that type of paint I used by default at school (from elementary to middle school) because I didn't know any other techniques (I knew others existed but I just.. didn't use them). Then I switched to acrylic (i wanted to try something else), then oil paint

703 2018-12-28 22:37:21 Shoutout to my man for taking my car to get an oil change and a car wash on this lovely Friday.
704 2018-12-28 22:37:13 I knew how to change oil & wipers lol. I still bait my friend into doing most of the mods so I can “watch and learn”
705 2018-12-28 22:37:12 Oil is there we know it.
706 2018-12-28 22:37:09 "Midnight Oil" Playing Live Again! Happening in 2019! 🖑🖑🖑
707 2018-12-28 22:37:01 God knows what these people do with their butter other than eat it.......it's like coconut oil
708 2018-12-28 22:36:58 The main thing wrong with my car is the catalytic converter I bought for it didn't work so I burn gas, then I need a value cover gasket because you can smell oil burning in it & the dome lights inside don't work smh
709 2018-12-28 22:36:26 This isn’t a present. This low of oil prices is an indication of a lagging world economy resulting in an oil glut. If you have a retirement account, low oil prices are terrible for it.
710 2018-12-28 22:36:23 Wild growth or olive oil & water
711 2018-12-28 22:35:49 I went to go get my oil changed and I literally had to do everything the guy was supposed to do. Check my oil filter in my dash, reset my oil life, and etc. I should have got a good discount.

713 2018-12-28 22:35:43 I don't know about their other products but the leave in conditioner really hydrates your hair but wow you need a proper oil to seal otherwise its a waste.
714 2018-12-28 22:35:41 Russia hasn’t finished stockpiling oil yet. They want to be able to carry on without updating anything to modern standards as long as possible. Even after the rest of us are committed to a clean Earth.
715 2018-12-28 22:35:41 I'm hoping many people in and around the Bush adminstration went to go see @vicemovie. Especially @BillOReilly and @FrankLuntz and @AlexNowrasteh. You should all be ashamed of yourselves. You made oil companies rich, got into 2 endless wars, and cut taxes for the rich. bravo
716 2018-12-28 22:35:40 High Voltage PT's (Potential Transformers) used to sense Voltage when not maintained properly run low on mineral Oil inside them. When this happens the Basic Insulation Level (BIL) is compromised and high voltage arcing results. I've seen it throughout my career.

718 2018-12-28 22:35:11 Inte alls förvånande... En bok jag läste för några år sedan "Who won the oil wars" av en journalist från New York tror jag.
Denna visade med all önskvärd tydlighet vad dom är beredda att göra för att skydda sina intressen. Mord finns på menyn...
719 2018-12-28 22:35:03 I shamelessly want alcohol based markers while the only painting I can do is oil painting
720 2018-12-28 22:34:53 Anhydrous Hemp Oil, or AHO, one of many compounds found in the hemp plant. I guess this is what they are talking about. Never heard of a plant called AHO
721 2018-12-28 22:34:50 Lamaist 100 percent of their exports and 50 percent of gdp come from oil, which was nationalized in 2007.  Nice try

727 2018-12-28 22:34:23 Moving house from England to Scotland during the 3 day week - not sure if I would be able to buy enough fuel (which was rationed) to get there in my self-drive van. OPEC had quadrupled the price of oil and the Trade Unions ran the country. Apart from that, it was a good decade!
728 2018-12-28 22:34:16 Paid my plates, changed my oil, & washed my car... about time man

737 2018-12-28 22:33:31 Agreed! It is scary seeing Saudi And Iran increase their domestic spending budgets so significantly despite the recent huge retracements in the price of oil. What is next for 2019? The question is, will demand from Europe and EMEs really drop as much as some analysts forecast?

741 2018-12-28 22:33:14 Don't confuse war for oil with revolutionary insurrection and Russia didn't influence any election. That was the DNC's obstruction of a populist for a billionaire who was filling high school gyms. Centrist you say ? 
742 2018-12-28 22:32:57 Couple of months back we’d have taken $70 all day long. The current flight from high oil prices is a welcome respite

753 2018-12-28 22:32:08 I know when my husband was in oil related industry many years ago it was good and bad when oil prices fluctuated. Lower good for consumers but meant less oil field workers as less needed.
754 2018-12-28 22:32:06 shows amount of oil that would have been used if vehicle was ICE, not electric.
755 2018-12-28 22:32:01 I will never be able to walk past a shelf of oil filter cap wrenches now without so doing this

760 2018-12-28 22:31:09 It's possible to do but is it feasible, if we can't make money. 
My Dad made a unit where he drove around on 1 gallon of gas for 100 Miles, not klms, which was wonderful but he passed and his invention went with him. He wouldn't sell it bcz he knew oil companies would buy it.....
761 2018-12-28 22:31:01 They clean up oil spills too. Kind of an important job.

764 2018-12-28 22:30:34 get Ins. Co. to pass on the cost to oil Co.

773 2018-12-28 22:29:45 That I shouldn’t lump all facilities in as “Westridge”....fair enough I can live with that....but does the “area” I referred to receive oil via Rail??? Yes it does. Find another hill to die on, this ain’t it.

779 2018-12-28 22:29:22 Iran has so many neighboring nations to work with, but short of having any border pipelines or thousands of trucks moving across the border, the only thing big enough to move enough oil to keep the economy afloat would be a VLCC supertanker. The Caspian Sea can't facilitate it.
780 2018-12-28 22:29:16 No squirrel oil? No mention of mother?
781 2018-12-28 22:29:13 Sometimes data journalism is like wildcatting for oil. You gotta chase a few non right ideas before you find the right one.
782 2018-12-28 22:29:09 When you get out a new roll of toilet paper, place a few drops of your favorite essential oil in the cardboard tube of the toilet paper.
783 2018-12-28 22:29:09 Candi-no one is doubting your masculinity. Now you go on and you change the oil in your car and change those tires. Just make sure to use a nice moisturizing lotion on your hands afterwards, maybe put on a nice suit, you’ll be fine. Keep blaming the left though, adds a nice touch

786 2018-12-28 22:28:54 David Cochrane asserts that the oil patch in AB and SK is not doing well. Wrong. It depends on which part of the oil patch. Large integrated oil companies are doing well. The industry is focused on costs and that means pursuing a reduction in labour costs. #cdnpoli @PnPCBC

793 2018-12-28 22:28:14 I’m v confused at why I just heard an ad on the radio for cbd oil at a boot store
794 2018-12-28 22:27:47 You’re in knots or not comprehending ...my original comment stated that there is oil by rail in Westridge (which I include all the facilities - right or wrong)...the semantic police stated there is no rail to Westridge ....which I proved wrong with photos. If you’re argument is..
795 2018-12-28 22:27:42 Average people endure much more and are to be admired for their perseverance and sacrifice than these two, but you'll rarely hear these inspiring stories. Most worshipped more accurate

797 2018-12-28 22:27:33 Well that didn’t work with hall/ebs/ etc....
The problem never gets solved because we don’t have a true #1 d and you can’t get them. You see what happens when we lose a number 2 d.
798 2018-12-28 22:27:30 Good info. Definitely think it's a worth while discussion. I keep coming back to one thing: an ICE car will *always* burn oil. An electric car will improve it's CO2 footprint as other things improve (more renewable sources for production/consumption).
799 2018-12-28 22:27:25  good for your pop! Same here... so grateful for my dad wanting to try the West!!!! He thrived in the oil biz.

801 2018-12-28 22:27:19 I selfishly would like the price of a barrel of oil to go up. We-well my dad-has an oil well in North Dakota. Mo money!(also more problems)
802 2018-12-28 22:27:08 .From comments on #Brexit to #Bloomberg analysts #oil price & growth forecasts, fear and optimism amplifiers appear ever more like sewthsayers pedling superstitions based on inappropriate cause and outcome links than indisputable applicable equations.  #Shame.
803 2018-12-28 22:27:07 we just hit a record output of 11.7 mbpd. It is one of the reasons you people are using to guarantee us $20 oil. (Gresham's Law always applies to oil biz) Other than that, no big bone to pick.

805 2018-12-28 22:26:32 That oil means nothing if they can't sell it. They surrounded. Russia and Syrian government can just wait and let Turkey and YPG destroy each other. Civilians in those areas don't support Assad anyways.

813 2018-12-28 22:25:17 It's a disinformation site posting mosltyl old and much debunked gibberish. They are clearly advocates for coal and oil. Be sceptical!!!
814 2018-12-28 22:25:06 Second. Report was flawed because it did not consider the issue of tanker traffic. A non issue since oil tanker traffic is negligible
815 2018-12-28 22:25:04 Do you still expect CADUSD at .87 or amended your view due to oil's weakness? That would a hell of a move from current level!
816 2018-12-28 22:24:54 yea, I need ya to run a quarterback draw along with an oil change, and check the tires while you're at it Jay!
817 2018-12-28 22:24:53 lol. We are in a low sun activity cycle.    The Grand Solar Minimun.   but by all means, keep trying to sell that snake oil.   I’ll be busy preparing for the mini ice age that’s coming.

827 2018-12-28 22:23:38 Expanding US energy policies isn’t really debatable... and does not favor Russia whose main output is energy production.

OF COURSE Putin make bank on oil/gas etc... that’s my point. Depressing prices does NOT help Putin

831 2018-12-28 22:23:11 Nobody's inspired by rich businessman posing as "progressive" whose sponsors are in the oil and gas industry. And "he doesn't take pac money" is disingenuous, they have plenty of "loopholes" to exploit and he and all #CorporateHo "dems" are working for #BigDonors, not the people
832 2018-12-28 22:23:01 Well actually they have quite a considerable quantity of Syrian oil. Also there's no particular enmity between Putins Tsarist 2.0 Russia and YPG - they actually had a mission there till fairly recently. Hows your head trollikins?
833 2018-12-28 22:22:56 OIL IS THE MOVE
834 2018-12-28 22:22:55 We never had to fight for market until about 4 years ago, when shale oil booms in US. The only difference is that Norway learned the lesson during the 70's oil crash. Norway oil fund gives lot of dividends to its own citizens

842 2018-12-28 22:21:30 Does Japan have crude oil?
843 2018-12-28 22:21:28 All money is not real, regardless of it's backing, gold and oil are no less fiat. Society survives because we all agree to accept things as we collectively define them. When we adjust, taxes that is agreeing. When you try to completely destroy Wall Street, you attack America.
844 2018-12-28 22:21:23 Yes certainly the Liberals are better than the Conservatives but certainly there are problems. (1) Climate change. You can't support @OilGasCanada with our tax dollars and pretend to be doing much about climate change. You're following the oil industry agenda IMO. (2) Seniors.
845 2018-12-28 22:21:21 It really works wonders. Worst case, try bonjela if you can’t get hold of clove oil. But Sainsbury’s pharmacies do it if you have one near you 
846 2018-12-28 22:21:15 No problem! I recommend mixing the BCO with any lighter oil you prefer tho, baobab oil is what I happened to have on hand
847 2018-12-28 22:20:57 UKOG, which it’s supporters like to remind me is debt free, has never returned a profit, and has raised equity by diluting its share count from  83m to 3.1 BILLION shares! I hope for the sake of those invested they hit oil soon

853 2018-12-28 22:20:37 They need to control oil, therefore to control oil prices.
854 2018-12-28 22:20:36 At least @rupertmurdoch - your sly slippery owner won't be bothering them, as he has allegedly decided to be cremated. #SerbTrio are still waiting to have @tetleyuk tea, and #Somali6 want to give him special 'olive oil' massage. @afneil @leshinton @JerryHall_ @tonygallagher
855 2018-12-28 22:20:36 That’s the deal with my sisters business. No specific policy is to blame. Less disposable cash is all. UPC can’t fix that. They can’t force the pipeline and they can’t control oil prices.

867 2018-12-28 22:19:24 Agreed. My organic Chem lecturer used to say the worst thing you can do to oil is burn it.
868 2018-12-28 22:19:22 Thank you! I didn't even know clove oil was a thing

877 2018-12-28 22:17:51 I asked for virgin olive oil. Disqualified as 'not a sauce'. Even if dribbled!
878 2018-12-28 22:17:51 A service economy that doesn't utilize advancement in technology, innovation, invention for it's own advantage, turns them over to others, loses the ultimate value to be gained from R&D, production of a product that can be sold which is the end goal.

880 2018-12-28 22:17:45 Greenwald's an old left Rus apologist (despite Rus' war on gays). Doesn't realize Rus' corrupt oil mafia oligarchy is what we need to avoid. and, he blocked me for asserting well reasoned, documented opinions. He's a propagandist who certainly bashed HRC wayyyy more than Trump.

882 2018-12-28 22:17:08 I'll take a mediocre Democrat if it means booting DeVos and getting rid of all the oil exploratory committees Zinke put in place. The wall is theater - we're in stanch the bleed mode as a country.
883 2018-12-28 22:17:06 Jason and his friend Andrew Scheer are misinformed.  BC gas prices even with carbon tax are just as low as the others across Canada.  The world is awash in oil.  Our dirty oil just doesn't command respect when it comes to pricing.  Takes too much to refine.  What's your plan?
884 2018-12-28 22:16:56 Yes the hadith of mountain of gold but SIH interpretation is that it was prophesied in 1974 when they fooled King Faisal that oil should be bought by petrodollar and I'm thinking now that Erdogan is doing it for the Israhell about the Greater Israhell project.
885 2018-12-28 22:16:42 High prices cause trudeau causing oil production shortage and his high carbon taxes on fuel you near sighted leftists

889 2018-12-28 22:16:22 If Scotland controlled all of its oil, we'd be as rich as Norway. If the price dropped by half, we'd still be phenomenally wealthy. Why is that a problem for you?
890 2018-12-28 22:16:18 my hair is obnoxiously thick and gets super dry, so i use dry-scalp shampoo and mix in some tea tree oil. i'm pretty sure i need to start coconut oil'ing my scalp asap

903 2018-12-28 22:14:57 The former leaders are no longer in power. The military chiefs do as they are told. As for the oil barons I'm not sure oil is what we are after in a lot of these countries. The immigration crisis isn't from Iraq. OPEC controls the oil anyway but dim liberals never remember this.

906 2018-12-28 22:14:20 Didn’t she JUST announce that she would reject monies from oil and gas? I mean, isn’t that announcement worth something? It’s a public one so can’t we hold her accountable?
907 2018-12-28 22:14:15 Also there is a hot meat mix out there or some type of cayenne oil that bothers the rodents but not the birds.

929 2018-12-28 22:12:18 There will be a recession at some point. That's how it works but for now the Fed is still raising rates to SLOW the economy down. The US is the largest oil producer. We are EXPORTING natural gas. We have the lowest Hispanic and black unemployment rates ever recorded. Relax

934 2018-12-28 22:11:52 Me trying to explain and air fryer to my coworker 

Me: It’s a machine that uses hot air to fry your food and make it nice and crispy without using oil! 

Coworker: You can’t technically fry anything without oil. So you’re technically baking.  
 

935 2018-12-28 22:11:48 Amen!

Jordan Peterson is an f’n fraud.

His Ph.D. & professorship demand from him responsibility in science & scholarship.  What does he deliver?  Making shit up outside his scope of “expertise”, to the enrichment of self & detriment if others.

939 2018-12-28 22:11:32 He voted against the Democrats and FOR drilling in the Gulf Coast. Also, he's the one who came up with the no oil $ pledge *his idea* then he took maximum donation of $2,700 from 37 different oil executives. If he had a pro-environment voting record I could maybe overlook it, but

944 2018-12-28 22:10:40  I've had this argument with my mum! She always said that the oil stops the pasta sticking together. After I explained the chemistry of oil and water, and how the two shall never mix, she stopped. Maybe that's what's happened here!!
945 2018-12-28 22:10:19 U gotta use multiple oils in your beard bro along with the castor oil,like jojoba, and coconut oil
946 2018-12-28 22:10:14 Rwanda is following the “no bullshit” #Asiantiger model growing a diversified economy at 6% for 10+ years without oil or minerals! Unemployment at 2%, currency 1 USD = 875 RF, national debt is under control.

952 2018-12-28 22:10:04 When we get back to school we’ll get the oil diffuser going 
953 2018-12-28 22:10:02 泣いてなんかいないよ、これは心の油だ。
954 2018-12-28 22:10:02 i want to know where they got these polls from, cs i know umpteen no voters that were oil workers a good mix... and it was a risounding ,out the uk in the EU
955 2018-12-28 22:09:59 @KyleKulinski can you do a show on wtf is up with Beto O’Rourke? This oil donations surfaced.. and the corporate democrats are supporting him.
956 2018-12-28 22:09:54 Yes, absolutely. Working for an oil company, when a storm came in we were all sent home except for the "Essential people". same in Biotech. Where have you been working that you have not heard of this?
957 2018-12-28 22:09:49 Germany has been progressing like chopping down a Redwood, all new homes are built with Solar, cars are set with fuel usage standards, lower the dependence of foreign fuels as technology for batteries is invested into. If we invested in renewables like we did with OIL, what then?
958 2018-12-28 22:09:42 Please give me tha oil name big cock
959 2018-12-28 22:09:31 The infamous alien anal probe.  Better find that bottle of olive oil. 
960 2018-12-28 22:09:26 at first I thought I owned nothing weird, but would an oil painting of me holding #MonatheCat count? Or is that just vanity?
961 2018-12-28 22:09:13 I am capitalism and my anatomy is the anatomy of a monster, I breathe fire, I consume oil, I tinker with your pretty brains.
962 2018-12-28 22:09:13 oil, leather pants and efforts to put ones hands down the opposite sides pants
963 2018-12-28 22:09:11 There was no more oil in the house, nor were there any candles.（家にはもう油がなく、ろうそくもありませんでした。）
964 2018-12-28 22:09:10 This warship's navigators (manned by a majority of women) managed to crash it into an oil tanker. Funnier thing is how they designed this ship to be unsinkable. They managed to even defy the logic of engineers.
965 2018-12-28 22:08:56 People that work the oil rigs get paid extra money cause of dangers. What’s difference between oil rigger and hockey player?
966 2018-12-28 22:08:56 That's cool. Me, I have only spears on the side. You ever have slightly breaded, fried pickles dipped in horseradish sauce? Killer. Or sweet butter pickles laced in Thai Chili Oil. The pickle flavor first, the sweet next, and the spicy burn after. So good.
967 2018-12-28 22:08:36 Honestly it looks like instant ramen and short grain rice, add hot sauce, chili oil, and chili powder, and steam like you would rice
968 2018-12-28 22:08:33 I need a full body message !! That good oil type
969 2018-12-28 22:08:28 This. 

Li is sort of it’s own beast. You can hammer sticks lightly covered in oil with a hammer to flatten them. It’ll still do bad stuff though.
970 2018-12-28 22:08:13 If only because we’ll stop drilling if the price point won’t support it.
971 2018-12-28 22:08:08 Just rose oil. It comes in a roller. I am so sorry I didn’t see your post. Twitter hasn’t been sending me my notifications! 
972 2018-12-28 22:08:07 When you arrive to pick up your car from the dealership after an oil change and the service advisor jokes “have you been looking for me b/c I’ve been hiding from you”  it’s Friday dude. Give me my car back.

976 2018-12-28 22:07:28 And it was Britain and France that caused the Middle East to be a hell hole contrary to beilef that the "muh oil" Americans did it
977 2018-12-28 22:07:11 I get it. I have been saying for years the free money needs to stop. The Fed has raised 9 times now and now the markets are flashing some signals of deflation, not inflation. See Oil, copper, lumber, the dollar. You don’t continue to raise rates into signs of deflation.

979 2018-12-28 22:07:06 PSA: Clove oil seriously burns the soft tissues in your mouth and should not be put in your mouth!!
980 2018-12-28 22:06:44 I don't remember who mentioned that Lavender oil helps prevent mosquito bites. Thank you cause wow even with the electric Raid on my son was the only one getting bitten.
Now, no more

983 2018-12-28 22:06:02 I’m up the street at the car place getting a oil change . Coming after we leave here
984 2018-12-28 22:05:47 Sesame oil is seed oil ... But, was used for centuries...Lindy, no?
985 2018-12-28 22:05:47 I get your point but allowing drilling without sufficient transmission lines was from a former administration.  Oil and gas control both parties to some extent.
986 2018-12-28 22:05:46 Now look at us, we recycle are oil, have compost piles for our garbage and other vegetation, we take our bottles cans paper and cardboard to the recycling center. I do love my compost pile it makes for a great fertilizer.
987 2018-12-28 22:05:39 Bouta start wearing bonnets when I go to sleep. That castor oil be breaking me out
988 2018-12-28 22:05:36 Mr Ford, your lack of understanding on this subject is showing.  1) gas prices around the world are dropping - you may have seen the issues AB is selling their oil for such low prices : 2) Ontario had cap and trade. Ms Elliott, please help your leader.  @OntarioPCParty
989 2018-12-28 22:05:35 Stick with the conversation (maybe stop vaping?) - this is about taking oil money. Using the same analysis they used it's easy to show Bernie doing the same thing, but then Bernie isn't held to that standard.

I throughly enjoy your oil paintings as well as your works in progress. Consider me a new follower. Happy New Years.
992 2018-12-28 22:05:21 Sesame oil is seed oil ... But, was used for centuries...Lindy, no?
993 2018-12-28 22:05:20 Yo raw black seed oil is fucking disgusting fam. But the benefits are ablazing
994 2018-12-28 22:05:14 This shit tastes like drink oil
995 2018-12-28 22:05:14 Firestone is out here trying to jack up their sales by adding additional, and unnecessary work on my car, when I simply came in for an oil change. I may not know a lot about cars, but I do know when I’m being taken advantage of.
996 2018-12-28 22:05:05 Horrible cars. Watergate. Billy Carter and a surge of southern pop culture (rock bands were great from that). Disco.  The Boss. Oil crisis. We began learning about terrorism. I was mostly depressed.
997 2018-12-28 22:05:04 it means the crater hole it dug had a nice upswing, which U recognized, called even if U had to wait 500 points that morning for it, whatever caused the crater is still there.....culmination of Trump policies, oils still weak, lot of people get squeezed when Oil stays down
998 2018-12-28 22:05:04 Peppermint castor oil feels bomb too!
999 2018-12-28 22:05:02 i got a email for cannabis oil why?

1002 2018-12-28 22:04:22 I see...it's ok to take a certain amount of dirty oil money if you're Bernie. Got it. Bernie Math strikes again!
1003 2018-12-28 22:04:22 "When you have one party that uses oil money, why do you insist on tying the hands of the Dem party behind their back, just to please YOU.  You do what you can with what you have." Act like a Republican
1004 2018-12-28 22:04:18 I bought that bio oil by the way
1005 2018-12-28 22:04:15 Jobs to Mexico as a favor to China for paying for his presidency. Obama blocked oil in our country driving up gas prices as a favor to the saudis for his presidency. Trump owns no one
1006 2018-12-28 22:04:03 Even has the correct vintage oil filters
1007 2018-12-28 22:04:01 Oil my hair daily

1011 2018-12-28 22:03:51 To a point. If cheap manufactured goods makes us richer as infinate truth, why manufacture anything? In fact, why work? 
End conclusion of this logic says consuming goods produced by others is the fastest way to wealth, actually making things holds you back
1012 2018-12-28 22:03:34 Biotechs, Oil & Gas Services, and Auto & Machine part manufacturing companies will be among the best-performing sectors in 2019...count on it. $XBI $SLB $HAL $NE $CAT $DAN $BWA $LEA

1015 2018-12-28 22:03:22 must be nice to be in your life and I kind of like an oil slick
1016 2018-12-28 22:03:17 What a bunch of rubbish! Since when does the wife take out the garbage, make general home repairs, change the oil in the car, trim the hedges, mow the lawn, and protect the family?
1017 2018-12-28 22:03:13 No Dickhead I'm saying take it up with the former leaders, military chiefs and oil barons who helped to create  this nightmare, not the people trying to flee it. But then that might take you out of your comfort zone.

1020 2018-12-28 22:02:57 Qatar did its bidding in Syria VIA Turkey both hands are dirty.... remember the Russians bombed those oil truck conveys heading to Turkey from eastern Syria back to the stone ages....  nice try
1021 2018-12-28 22:02:45 All about greed. Trading arms and taking oil.
1022 2018-12-28 22:02:41 How about I oil ya beards sometime? 
1023 2018-12-28 22:02:41 That seems like something Hydro Quebec should be consulted? My moderately sized home uses an 18kw furnace, that’s a huge amount of juice and why they reward oil users with reduced rates in warm weather.
1024 2018-12-28 22:02:35 Brent crude is current $59.91 a barrel, ya rocket. If Scotland got the tax take on all its oil and not 'attributed' income on just 8.4% of it, we'd make more money than we do now on $5.99 a barrel.
1025 2018-12-28 22:02:29 Well Cs can set Teflon stirrer bars on fire under argon and will explode if it comes in contact with water. 

Na and K though, eh. You can do it if you’re aware of what you’re doing. Keep them covered in oil etc.
1026 2018-12-28 22:02:25 I’ll bring the oil
1027 2018-12-28 22:02:22 @Bethaneyyyy just reminded me that I didn’t get my white cotton candy this year!!!! It’s the only time of the year I can usually find some. 

Fun fact in case you didn’t know: I’m allergic to red#40 and cottonseed oil.
1028 2018-12-28 22:02:17 I got a super amazing non stick pan from Tesco. I manage to make whatever I need without oil and no problems w sticking

1030 2018-12-28 22:01:58 Pretty much, I just wanted oil warm enough to get moving. About 15 minute.
1031 2018-12-28 22:01:57 What Old Winter God did I piss off? Last winter my water heater shit the bed in February and today I discovered my oil tank is leaking and it's looking like our only viable option is switching to a gas boiler. For many $$$. In January.

1034 2018-12-28 22:01:47 Rwanda is following the “no bullshit” #Asiantiger model growing a diversified economy at 6% for 10+ years without oil or minerals! They also have a compulsory monthly “Umuganda” day of national service, where everybody help to clean streets and parks, build schools and fix roads.
1035 2018-12-28 22:01:44 Cheap gas isn’t sustainable. Just saying. Lol
1036 2018-12-28 22:01:43 if u put weed oil in the diffuser, can u get high off the vapor?
1037 2018-12-28 22:01:36 Hmmmm. What is state with largest oil/gas interests?  Perhaps Texas. Who were running neck and neck in Nov election in that state?  Cruz & Beto. Does industry donate to candidates to hedge its bets in an election?  Im thinking yes. Why is anyone surprised by this.
1038 2018-12-28 22:01:02 Love oil
1039 2018-12-28 22:00:58 We use our own products, cheaper than importing foreign. We pay a lot for foreign oil, fund foreign workers who have horrendous human rights records. We were prosperous b4 the libs & ndp worked their black magic.
1040 2018-12-28 22:00:36 @BobbiBrown guys feel really disappointed, thought I’d treat myself to your oil free foundation full cover, powder & concealer..well even when I use primer and do the right base my skin is greaser then a chip shop by lunch time & full cover is def isn’t! Not happy refund please!

1045 2018-12-28 22:00:12 Whenever I go get my cars oil change, the guys be telling me I need all this crap for my car when i know it’s not necessary but since I’m a girl they think they can fool me. Smh

1048 2018-12-28 21:59:57 Bleach it with a low volume bleach and invest in argon oil!! It works wonders. When I went from putple to red my hair ended up feeling like straw and within a month or two of using it after every wash (1-2 times a week) it felt soft again. You shouldn’t get too much damage..
1049 2018-12-28 21:59:52 Thanks for the welcome, having experienced back pain due to scheurmanns disease in my early teens I have tried no end of chemicals all with varying success and side effects. CBD oil has certainly worked for me and enhances my over all wellbeing.
1050 2018-12-28 21:59:50 Can you have complete energy  Independence if you export your resources? We are gonna  run out of oil way before Russia and Canada... So will those two be world leaders when oil is gone here?
1051 2018-12-28 21:59:40 Because the EPA was corrupt. It was used to hide slush funds that paid groups to protest at Trump rallies.
1052 2018-12-28 21:59:37 bio: matured at sea, grows olive branches out of earlobes, soaked in red wine and I’m dripping in olive oil
1053 2018-12-28 21:59:33 If our oil per barrel is so cheap ask yourself why energy that use oil still very expensive? #oilLies #ABgouge #ABleg #cdnpoli #yeg #yyc #abpoli #nopipelines

1055 2018-12-28 21:59:22 The secret to happiness is to see all the marvels of the world,  and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.

1057 2018-12-28 21:58:55 Your gov. has no credibility whatsoever with your investment of almost 6 billions in crude oil.
1058 2018-12-28 21:58:44 Ugh stuffed thank God I do omad, a steak marinated in olive oil one avocado 4 slices of organic bacon
1059 2018-12-28 21:58:41 there's nothing on this planet oil industry isn't willing to pollute&spill out their disgusting mess.

1063 2018-12-28 21:58:22 Nah, it was more than just some dispassionate assessment of his record. One piece by Sirota all but implied, falsely, that Beto was owned by big oil, leaving out all relevant and useful context. That’s just one example.

1075 2018-12-28 21:57:39 I really enjoy my own company .. like just wait til I get this salt rock and oil diffuser. babyyyy

1077 2018-12-28 21:57:26 My car yesterday: everythings good bitch
My Car Today: your gascap’s gone, change your oil, and light me on fire bitch
1078 2018-12-28 21:57:11 Ima be really upset if my phone dies before my oil change is done lol
1079 2018-12-28 21:57:04 Think I confused some people with that. The oil change itself wasn’t $1000, but on inspection my car also needed new brakes, tire rotation and a brake light wiring issue. The place I go to is trusted, my friend works there.
1080 2018-12-28 21:56:58 Volatility was the theme this week as there were multiple days with the Dow moving 700 points or more.

1082 2018-12-28 21:56:53 We’re in CLIMATE CRISIS! So while we have a rolling dumpster fire as President, David was correctly pointing out that our last non rolling dumpster fire of a President is currently bragging proudly about how he was the #OilPresident!!! U know as in Oil = Climate Change?? 
1083 2018-12-28 21:56:29 Uhh @enbycat put spicy oil on their clitty and that worked out okay. Sauce might be a bit weird. Idk about in the vag tho

1086 2018-12-28 21:55:51 That thing where you’re getting your oil changed and while you’re waiting you’re inside and Judge Judy is on the TV they have set up in there so you’re watching - and for a minute you’re just quietly, calmly content
1087 2018-12-28 21:55:34 If we don't move it that means importing more oil by, you guessed it pipelines! After the oil is brought in by tankers. Those are the current choices and most likely the only two for the next 30 years. Did you know only 35% of oil production is used as fuel? Lots of other uses.
1088 2018-12-28 21:55:31 The capitalist billionaire siphon off the world's oil into their tankers, while millions have to burn manure for heat.
1089 2018-12-28 21:55:27 This bird was moving fine at the time, otherwise I'd have gone and told one of the wardens. Would have felt bad if I'd found out it was oil years later!
1090 2018-12-28 21:55:23 Desde Secretaría de Energía, destacaron que el incremento de la electricidad no será mayor debido a la disminución del costo mayorista a partir de una mayor producción de gas natural, que permite desplazar el consumo de fuel oil en las centrales térmicas.
1091 2018-12-28 21:55:15 I think it's a good thing that Buhari has Dangote and Otedola on his campaign team..

It will make sending him back to Daura a bit easier.

Dangote Truck to pack his load, Otedola Forte Oil  to fuel the truck.
1092 2018-12-28 21:54:57 Oil Dey my head bra  Ezege
1093 2018-12-28 21:54:54 I had fun painting with friends even tho oil paintings get on my nerves. Also it’s past my bedtime and I got a nail appointment at 9am tomorrow.
1094 2018-12-28 21:54:51 How @HillF1 was able to see with a visor coated in oil I’ll never know. It wasn’t a bad season however. Proper cars/engines etc.
1095 2018-12-28 21:54:48 無限ループw
1096 2018-12-28 21:54:32 Another climate storm in BC today.    The future looks bleak because politicians keep propping up the oil/gas industry with our money, then take to twitter to issue bland statements about "building a better future".
1097 2018-12-28 21:54:28 I just paid $100 to get my oil changed. this is how my days going
1098 2018-12-28 21:54:16 Tonight’s Grilled Flatbread Pizza
Baby Heirloom Tomatoes, Prosciutto, Fresh Mozzarella and Basil Oil “White Pizza”…$12.50
1099 2018-12-28 21:54:12 Bell bottoms, long hair, Carter brought calm to the Middle East, oil become scarce, cigarettes were on their way out, boxing was a sport, space travel was real, racism still persisted.
1100 2018-12-28 21:54:04 Nigeria is still thinking of how to find more oil wells. Who we looking to sell to?
1101 2018-12-28 21:54:00 Dent in the passenger side, needs oil change, needs to be cleaned.
1102 2018-12-28 21:53:54 This tea tree oil really putting in work
1103 2018-12-28 21:53:53 Paper products(tp, paper towels, coffee filters, etc.) olive oil, cleaning products. (The reasons to buy bulk products)
1104 2018-12-28 21:53:36 407-824-0976 to make an appt... but they do routine stuff like oil changes
1105 2018-12-28 21:53:31 He's not supported by big oil. That's a fallacy going around. And the insinuation that being against the wall like 70% of the country is and the reasons called out in the video , is due to his own financial gain. And what does M4A have to do with the wall .
1106 2018-12-28 21:53:29 I saw that thing from about 14 miles across Queens.  Not having a clue wtf it was, for the 1st time ever I was happy not to be at an interesting job as a responder.  Xformer oil + copper cant be good to breathe.
1107 2018-12-28 21:53:26 Used to go to Houston a bit with work (Aberdeen so oil!) and Austin was always a benefit.  Even saw 13th floor elevators in first gig since before I was born...in 1969...
1108 2018-12-28 21:53:18 I usually wash my hair about once a week, but if I have it stretched I push it to three/ four weeks. It works well and I just put some oil on top of it
1109 2018-12-28 21:53:07 #OIL #OOTT #WTI 
WTI appears to be running up from the current level AOTW.
1110 2018-12-28 21:52:52 note to future pixee:
collect your CBD oil tomorrow  #spoonie
1111 2018-12-28 21:52:52 But joking aside, I'd love to hear your response: the Thatcherite 'economic miracle' of the 80s was underwritten by a once in a lifetime North Sea oil + gas boom, taxed at 90%. In Norway, the corresponding money was placed in a Sovereign Wealth fund...
1112 2018-12-28 21:52:45 There will be no protests in the streets.
Freeways will not be clogged by masses of humanity expressing outrage. 
Largely the opinion of pro illegal advocates is, this is the tolerable price we pay for diversity/ inclusion bcse its who we really are. 
Its not
1113 2018-12-28 21:52:30 @elisacarrio @mauriciomacri @BoubeeCristina Sr. PRESIDENTE: por favor prwsenre un proyecto de midficacion de ley que permita producir y vender libremente el biodiesel en la República Argentina. Asi no tendria que importar tanto gas oil bajo la norma Euro3 o 4.
1114 2018-12-28 21:51:48 I hate it when the dudes that do my oil change ask me questions. Do I look like I know anything about cars aside from “vroom vroom”?
1115 2018-12-28 21:51:46 Yeah, back in the 60s & 70s, where our government had the guts to stand up to the oil & gas industry. 80s 90s 00s 10s...not so much.
1116 2018-12-28 21:51:38 Allll the time
1117 2018-12-28 21:51:27 We can't be Turkey's adversary while maintaining 17 bases in Turkey, and with oil flowing into Turkey from the south.
1118 2018-12-28 21:51:26 It's my feeling that; on some things, they are aligned. But mostly just currying favor. Money, power & greed are their exclusive motivations. The corruption runs very deep, w/many of the GOP being entirely complicit & beholden to Russia/lobbyists/special interest groups (NRA,Oil)
1119 2018-12-28 21:51:25 Why do old people like cbd oil so much? Seriously, it was illegal because of you guys!
1120 2018-12-28 21:51:16 Castor Oil.
1121 2018-12-28 21:50:51 I take CBD oil almost every day and I swear my zen level is unmatched when I’m on it.
1122 2018-12-28 21:50:34 His Voting record is fair game. Trying to paint him as owned by oil and gas b/c some industry employees donated to him is not. That’s an important distinction.
1123 2018-12-28 21:50:23 My brothers keep using my hot sesame oil that I make with my stir fry better be ready to buy more bottles when it runs out
1124 2018-12-28 21:50:21 So the Liberal Party is responsible for the price of oil? Wow, they are powerful.
1125 2018-12-28 21:50:13 Spiderverse makes me want to create something. Like i watched it and immediately wanted to draw Miles or Peter Parker or draw with oil pastels even though i’ve never done that before.
1126 2018-12-28 21:50:11 Sesh wit Dave East Sunday  I'mma try get him to hit this hash oil 
1127 2018-12-28 21:50:08 Rwanda is following the “no bullshit” #Asiantiger model growing a diversified economy at 6% for 10+ years without oil or minerals!..It’s proven before by Singapore and South Korea, and it’s arguably the only effective strategy for Africa if we want to be leaders of tomorrow!!
1128 2018-12-28 21:50:01 We were fine with Afghanistan being a failed state as well until Sept 11th. And Iraq being a nasty little despotism until Saddam threatened our oil supply.
1129 2018-12-28 21:49:55 Na u dey oil my brain na....base on who u be....we gada position ni baby mi..
1130 2018-12-28 21:49:53 omg JUST looked at Poison!!! There's like 3 kinda tho. And I heard the glossier is too subtle/short lived. I'm personally into Elizabeth & James nirvana (mix black + white, and amethyst). I like mixing them with like cheap oil perfumes i've bought abroad hehe
1131 2018-12-28 21:49:51 God save my country from the slavery of foreign goods & services. Apart from Oil & Gas dose it mean we don't have anything to offer d world?
1132 2018-12-28 21:49:42 Amazing music, dancing to live bands every weekend, bell bottoms, hippies, Jesus Freaks, long straight hair, flower power, muscle cars, Vietnam War & protests, Watergate, oil crisis, disco, Star Wars, The Godfather, Jaws, M*A*S*H, Roots, Dallas....
1133 2018-12-28 21:49:40 Manager to me: I ain’t giving her no discount! Oil change prices went up since 1997

Manager to customer: of course! I’ll even discount your next service and fill up your gas tank. How bout I wipe your ass too?
1134 2018-12-28 21:49:26 Welcome Saul to Twitter and hello, I've heard lots of mixed reviews for CBD oil which seems to either be at polar opposites on its efficacy. Good news in terms of its support to help you on your path #TODAYiCAN
1135 2018-12-28 21:49:24 @iam_Davido You too much Oil dey ur head 
1136 2018-12-28 21:49:19 Will you build this wall with aluminum Trump has unilaterally taken off the Russian sanctions list along with oil - put there because of the attack on our system of free and fair elections by our enemies in Russia. I know, he surrendered to Iran, Syria, Isis + Taliban too!
1137 2018-12-28 21:49:18 The Irving’s import less than 20% of their oil from the Saudi’s, and ironically the Trudeau family is also friends with the Irving’s. What is your point?
1138 2018-12-28 21:49:15 Saw "oil free hand lotion FOR MEN" in a store.  
Immediate response: "fuck the patriarchy my hands are dry"
1139 2018-12-28 21:49:13 Well, by "select" she means representatives if big oil, wall street, banking, investment firms, and auto manufacturers. They will try and figure out how to maintain their profits while pretending to affect climate change. The Democratic Party will then declare they've solved it.
1140 2018-12-28 21:49:07 今日は何オイルがいいかい?アロマオイルで香りたい?オリーブオイルでイタリアンたい?ふふふ…僕は君のためならどんなオイルにもなってやるさ…

1144 2018-12-28 21:48:38 If there was a snowballs chance any of those things would pass Nancy would get them passed.   This is the legacy of the clown Bernie Sanders.   None of his policies were ever going to pass  but he sold them like snake oil.
1145 2018-12-28 21:48:35 I'm really glad they have finally legalized medical hemp oil everywhere. Without the TCP it's non-addictive and no hallucinating. I hope insurance will cover it now and the price comes down.

1149 2018-12-28 21:48:03 so you figure buying that old pipeline for billions from a Texas oil giant who saw no value in it was a good thing?
1150 2018-12-28 21:47:59 Jake took my car to get an oil change since im at work and they detailed it for me love me a clean car
1151 2018-12-28 21:47:53 Then brought up oil burning along with China which is also false. Troll.
1152 2018-12-28 21:47:49 It is one reason but not by any stretch the only reason. In fact the real reason is $43. a barrel oil. The price of oil is volatile and right now it is low. When it is high the price of gas will increase proportionally. Tweet good tidings when this occurs.
1153 2018-12-28 21:47:46 He is a criminal and snake oil salesman.
1154 2018-12-28 21:47:44 A very sad & incompetent attempt at that wonderful US invention #PlausibleDeniability .... the truth is no staffer would dare hold back such information from their boss for fear of losing their job. It’s like trying put out the fire by pouring oil on it.
1155 2018-12-28 21:47:33 I have a cafe sandwich press oil dipped toast and wanky pretentious mixed berry jam gripe. Stick some nice bread in the fucking toaster, serve with butter and a nice apricot or strawberry jam on the side with my coffee. Easy.

1160 2018-12-28 21:46:44 Coconut oil, caster oil and MPL
1161 2018-12-28 21:46:42 I do believe if the U.S. doesn't intervene in falling oil prices, that it will soon have a negative impact on our nation as well if it keeps falling.
1162 2018-12-28 21:46:40 Coconut oil is literally the worst most congestive oil you can apply to your skin.
1163 2018-12-28 21:46:31 (Meets person)

(I finish my laudanum-cola, hop on my penny farthing, and pedal away)

#podcast
1164 2018-12-28 21:46:26 Did not say that. Please read before tweeting. Just said that burning oil leads to unhealthy air pollution. That is a fact.
1165 2018-12-28 21:46:19 Mm, hot chocolate with marsh mallows and whipped cream! No dairy, gluten or soya, so basically palm oil and sugar. But it's a rare treat for these children.
1166 2018-12-28 21:46:19 Cars are massively subsidized in every way possible, not just the obvious infrastructure, but tax breaks, license training in public schools, illegal wars to defend oil supplies, etc
1167 2018-12-28 21:46:18 Positive spin: Lucas oil > Nissan stadium
1168 2018-12-28 21:46:01 The few items made by Cadbury and lindt that don't contain palm oil
1169 2018-12-28 21:45:48 To think of the things we used to do with motor oil back in the 60s, I cringe.
1170 2018-12-28 21:45:48 Grapeseed oil
1171 2018-12-28 21:45:41 #GoAwayBernie you lousy snake oil salesmen.
1172 2018-12-28 21:45:41 Really? No resources? Then WTH were all those Euros rushing over here for? Learn some history, racist. No furs, gold, diamonds, furs, trees, medicinal plants, oil? Did those all suddenly appear when MacDonald became Prime Minister?
1173 2018-12-28 21:45:38 Out for bevs n sick to my stomach with anxiety over absolutely nothing, time to get the shots of CBD oil in xx
1174 2018-12-28 21:45:33 Burn jackfruit and snap pea in curry powder briefly. Sprinkle with a touch of mustard oil.
1175 2018-12-28 21:45:18 A retired PS....living in Victoria...LaLa Land....out of touch with reality...a province that elected E. May....and blocks a pipeline while using oil and exporting coal....etc...etc.
1176 2018-12-28 21:45:06 Being native, I know & for years have warned about several things. Thats why ive exposed bankers, big oil, corps, oligarchs, zionist israels militarized police aipac and netanyahu agenda/control of foreign & domestic policy. 

I am relentlessly tweeting #IsraelGate. Listen.
1177 2018-12-28 21:44:56 the boscia cleansing oil is my wife
1178 2018-12-28 21:44:38 Oil needs to go to tidewater for the economy. Make it so, PMJT. CPC and NDP are not looking strong, why not go for Energy East for a change?
1179 2018-12-28 21:44:34 Asparagus rolled in olive oil & salt, roast in oven, squeeze lemon and dust nutritional yeast after roasting. Delicious.
1180 2018-12-28 21:44:30 Get some black seed oil. It will clear it up. Thank me later
1181 2018-12-28 21:43:55 My mom put oil in her hair and spiked it up, and it is the cutest thing ever. I am so in love with this womxn 
1182 2018-12-28 21:43:51 There was an oil drilling game I found for iOS on iPhone. I didn’t like it though. I think I’ll try this just for kicks.
1183 2018-12-28 21:43:34 lmao dude that changed my oil made a comment about the fact I have 3 pairs of crocs on my floor 
1184 2018-12-28 21:43:34 Soooooo tepid. Wasting oil trying to have tepid starts so cold starts it is.
1185 2018-12-28 21:43:31 when the recipe says "drizzle some olive oil" and you go ahead and soak it like a dumb bitch you are.
1186 2018-12-28 21:43:27 I literally use one oil on my head and i’ve been doing just fine
1187 2018-12-28 21:43:24 I didn’t say I needed an oil change, scratched it, or flattened a tire “already”
1188 2018-12-28 21:43:16 The solutions are  to build the pipelines, create refineries, cut off foreign oil, get out oil to market. We have enough to sustain our own country.
1189 2018-12-28 21:43:10 Johny_Enrique It is excellent Johny - a healthy source of fat, protein & fiber. At least half of the fat in peanuts is healthy monounsaturated fat, the kind found in olive oil and avocados.  Coincidentally, I have an article coming out next week on peanuts. :) RT
1190 2018-12-28 21:43:00 Lol.  Bless your heart, you think she cares...  She's no different than con men ripping off senior citizens with lottery schemes or driveway "sealer" that's nothing but thinned out tar or used motor oil..she promised free shit to people who think they deserve it for being alive.
1191 2018-12-28 21:42:39 I quit on Shea moister I use mielle and as I am... with my oil mix 
1192 2018-12-28 21:42:36 @jkenney Albertans in coal districts that Notley has or wants shut down need to know a Jason Kenney UCP government will reverse that - plus cancel all tax-wasting solar/wind programs and get oil back on track.
1193 2018-12-28 21:42:23 i’m not a fan of the jamcian castor oil line w them, i used it for transitioning and still wasn’t pleased but the manuka honey deep conditioner was amazing on my hair. you can try the sample packets from walmart see if you like it
1194 2018-12-28 21:42:21 Maybe New Year’s Eve. Hot oil treatment, clipped ends and flat ironed straight.
1195 2018-12-28 21:42:07 Over the years there is definable ebb and flow driven by socioeconomic/ geopolitical conditions outside U.S control. 
Building walls now is very similar to increasing structural integrity of levees BEFORE that major storm hits. Hindsight saves no lives.
1196 2018-12-28 21:42:05 why dem no invite obinim for the national cathedral fundraising dinner, like Abofosem na ebi si si...sticker,oil den tins

1198 2018-12-28 21:41:58 Thanks big oil and gas
1199 2018-12-28 21:41:55 Wow! Not a good look for a lambo owner. Those are purchased by Arabs in the oil business and gay people. I'd return it
1200 2018-12-28 21:41:52 Lmao I thought my motor was going out for a good 2 weeks but turns out my stupid ass wasn’t putting enough oil in my car 
1201 2018-12-28 21:41:51 I ve been a fan of @KennieJD for a while now and ive wondered can we get like an eyebrow routine?? Or here’s me doing my eyebrows?? Or trying Kbeauty eyebrow oil (if they have that)I always find myself staring at them because they re so clean and thick and luscious 
1202 2018-12-28 21:41:49 There's also been some rumors that Rojava may be split into 2 sectors, a fully independent nation in the north, and a technically government controlled be still generally autonomous region in the south in which Syria's oil companies will control the oil fiels
1203 2018-12-28 21:41:48 I used to take 150mg of sertraline and 350 pregabalin but have managed to ween myself off both, although a rocky road, thanks to CBD oil, it has been the most natural and effective support I have tried in my 51 years. This is Saul by the way, kinda new to twitter
1204 2018-12-28 21:41:46 My doctor recommended primrose oil I was going to try it but I walked a good 6 miles in a 5 hour period and went into labor the next day
1205 2018-12-28 21:41:43 Have a good evening. Amd tomorrow I will tell you all about how changes to some EU regs now mean I cannot burn waste oil cleanly for heat and now have to pay to have it taken away to be processed and then buy heating fuel at worse inglemann scale exhaust gasses.
1206 2018-12-28 21:41:43 Your gonna need a frying pan, little oil, and some Sake

1209 2018-12-28 21:41:23 War ended 
Economic conditions not well
But you could get by
Oil shortage HAHA 
Minimum wage $ 2.20 an hour
1210 2018-12-28 21:41:23 He can’t herd cats either , but a pipeline to tide water would increase our sale value to match USA and when oil prices go up and they will be in position to reap revenues ALL Canadians will benefit from .
1211 2018-12-28 21:41:16 Air pollution from oil really unhealthy. That is a fact.
1212 2018-12-28 21:41:05 I suggest getting her as soon as you can to a chiro or physio, I really helps. Do you have a TENS unit? (Dr.Ho) a couple times a day really helps with heat. I’m doing acupuncture as well, as well as OCB oil, anything that helps
1213 2018-12-28 21:40:55 Ebube, I was told he just finished paying for MTN, NICON, Forte Oil, Dangote group of Company and Wema Bank. He has the largest shares in Coca-Cola, Globacom, NNPC and EBUBE FC
1214 2018-12-28 21:40:53 Shut up Omar.  Come on nick Saban ruined the organization!  We are where we are because of his a hole. He’s a snake oil sales man plane and simple.
1215 2018-12-28 21:40:46 It is excellent Johny - a healthy source of fat, protein & fiber. At least half of the fat in peanuts is healthy monounsaturated fat, the kind found in olive oil and avocados.  Coincidentally, I have an article coming out next week on peanuts. :)
1216 2018-12-28 21:40:28 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.
1217 2018-12-28 21:40:28 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

1219 2018-12-28 21:40:20  Pizza topped with capicollo, spinach, extra-virgin olive oil, and pineapple.
1220 2018-12-28 21:40:18 Thanks. Just had a look at previous photos taken that day and it was raining pretty heavily so the area around the burrow must have been pretty muddy. Glad it was that rather than oil!
1221 2018-12-28 21:40:13 Sears at the @BoulevardMall closes in March. So may memories of that  place, including going with grandpa when the oil needed changing on the Pontiac.

1276 2018-12-28 21:33:41 It seems we’re throwing the baby out with the bath water.  I thought exporting oil was ridiculous and leaving money on the table, to export the raw bitumen, only to buy it back at inflated world prices as crude is robbing Canadians of billions in value.
1277 2018-12-28 21:33:31 @JustinTrudeau Why, if we have a ban on oil tankers on the north west coast of BC do we allow US articulated tanker barges to ply the inside passage to Alaska.

1278 2018-12-28 21:33:26 Well I work for ConEd and responded to the fire last night. All metal fires burn blue and the oil in the transformer is what made it burn longer. The windings in the transformer are solid copper and it melting to the ground
1279 2018-12-28 21:33:20 Canada exports oil to the U.S. and imports from it as well. That works fine. What is ridiculous is that Canada also imports oil in Eastern Canada from overseas when it could have been supplied from Western Canada by the Energy East pipeline.

1358 2018-12-28 21:22:57 I think the concept of being trapped in an oil painting for your hubris is a very unexplored venue for character development
1359 2018-12-28 21:22:54 The world needs and uses oil. 100 million barrels a day and rising. But Alberta with the forth largest oil reserves on the Planet, shouldn’t take advantage of that ...? GTFO

1366 2018-12-28 21:22:20 Thanks! I bet she has that so every time she fries something in hot oil she can compare it to the destruction of ratyes’ careers (as if they ever had careers to begin with). What a legend
1367 2018-12-28 21:22:16 I am currently utilizing various products derived from the Cannabis plant, which, according to many professional sources, is most likely the most versatile plant on the planet, and I am interested in CBD Oil. Cannabidiol has extremely powerful healing potential!

1372 2018-12-28 21:21:54 @RepBetoORourke Beto O’Rourke .... taking money from oil and gas industry.... and voting against Medicare for all, reducing financial regulation ..... it appears you are now in bed with the oil and gas industry and the Wall Street crowd ...... is this true or not ??

Corallian also conducted preliminary mapping of a separate area around the 98/11-1 well, south of the Colter prospect, which indicates that there is the potential for Prospective Resources of up to 27 million barrels of recoverable oil.
1391 2018-12-28 21:19:31 That's quite funny.
Since Thatcher sold off our publically owned companies.
Wasted our north sea oil revenues.
And claimed that it wasn't  "Our" money that she gained that was responsible for her being able to give tax cuts.
But Tory fiscal management:)
1392 2018-12-28 21:19:28 If you have visited Nigeria u will understand  what I am saying....we are one of the richest oil producing country in the world yet...we don't have
* good education 
* good road
* high level of unemployment 
* poor infrasture. 

And our people are leaving in abject poverty.
1393 2018-12-28 21:19:27 I agree with that, but voting for billionaire son-in-law and oil company, banks, and hedge fund boy won't do that
1394 2018-12-28 21:19:26 Have you actually read anything about NS Oil? you haven't a clue or a hope in hell of keeping hold of us
1395 2018-12-28 21:19:21 Why do some people feel they have to have small talk with someone when in a waiting area. Like, I'm just here for an oil change, not conversation.

1404 2018-12-28 21:18:02 Just had to announce in front of everyone at the oil change place that my car is a 2019 and I felt like such an asshole
1405 2018-12-28 21:17:59 Ok then. Your tweet was accusing Kathy Castor of being in bed with oil companies, suggesting that’s why she was named instead of AOC. Nothing about experience or knowledge. Just an immediate attack. So, what is you problem with Castor’s policies?
1406 2018-12-28 21:17:52 The deluge of snake oil salesmen masquerading as "E-Sports Consultants" these days is only going to exacerbate the problem. Lots of well-meaning companies with new (or renewed) interest in esports will likely be lead astray.
1407 2018-12-28 21:17:43 U.S oil prices rose 1.6% to settle at $45.33 a barrel, despite smaller than expected drop in crude inventories

1409 2018-12-28 21:17:34 At the present moment it's strictly a multi faceted intelligence operation, we have seen it before.  I think at this point Russia intends to focus on a larger geopolitical operation targeting the oil backed dollar and potential allies.

1) Make a plan for a #GreenNewDeal
2) Ensure a #JustTransition for frontline communities
3) Have subpoena power
4) Members can’t take Big Oil $
1411 2018-12-28 21:17:12 If you think that taking big oil money doesn't compromise their decision making, "then you're not anchoring yourself in reality"
1412 2018-12-28 21:17:10 I know. *smiles, wiping the engine oil off his hind before holding it out to the girl* 
Finn’s told me all about you. *somthing twinged at the corner of his usual smirk, but his expression remained mostly pleasant* You’re...all he talks about.
1413 2018-12-28 21:17:10 Downstream emissions as a consideration make no sense as no matter where the oil is sourced, burning it will produce the same amount of GHG’s. It’s an escape clause.

1422 2018-12-28 21:16:20 I just bought a set of stress relief balls & an essential oil diffuser for lavender oil to help me relax. The meds just aren’t enough. My hair will be totally white in 2 years I fear.
1423 2018-12-28 21:16:03 Giving billions of tax dollars to snake oil salesmen ain’t a good idea, Sport.
1424 2018-12-28 21:16:01 all i can think about is how I was younger i tried to make fried pickles and the fire alarm started going off so i threw the pan of hot oil into the sink and poured water on it... how am i not dead.
1425 2018-12-28 21:16:01 I can't be the only one working right now. Share some love if you're burning the holiday oil with me. #freelancelife #contractorlife #nomadlife

1427 2018-12-28 21:15:17 I started driving in 74 the oil embargo was over. My first car a 67 2dr Chevelle. The mussel cars of the 60s were cheep. We lived like American Graffiti. We could get beer at 18. Saturday night dances at various high schools. It was a magical time 4 me. I met my wife to be in 75.
1428 2018-12-28 21:15:16 Depending who you ask , good for enviro ? Hmm maybe , but surely someone will produce that oil if not us , good for economy I doubt it .

1434 2018-12-28 21:15:03 In order to save dollars & generate low cost electricity, Govt has put permanent ban on Furnace oil imports (In past, heavy reliance on FO imports) to cut down Energy bill --- Wonderful strategic decision !

1436 2018-12-28 21:14:57 Is that you have to say? Im trying to have a serious conversation and your throwing insults around. Seriously look up George Soros work with Venezuela on helping their oil company fight the socialism lose of money by -16% GDP over the last 4 years.
1437 2018-12-28 21:14:38 And why is that?  What would change that?  Why do they need big oil money?How do you compete with the other side when use big oil money? I'm sorry...if you think the left can compete using small donations, every candidate, then you're not anchoring yourself in reality.
1438 2018-12-28 21:14:34 The only thing that still make Nigeria one is the oil in Niger Delta remove oil Nigeria will split. So let us not deceiving ourselves.
1439 2018-12-28 21:14:33 A drop in oil prices, sure, but many more factors on top of it. More drops coming.
1440 2018-12-28 21:14:33 Whereas here, tons of our taxes go to corporate welfare - endless handouts to the MIC, Big Ag, Big Chem, Big Pharma, Oil and Gas, etc. Rather have Denmark ANY day. The $$ goes back to serving the people & quality of life! And no one goes bankrupt because of medical bills. Nice!
1441 2018-12-28 21:14:30 GettN oil change here at Walmart. I turn down the air filter check & wiper blade replacement.  $10 a piece! 
No Thank you!!
1442 2018-12-28 21:14:23 I had a two o’clock appointment. All I needed was for them to change my oil and rotate my tires. Yet, I’m still here and they literally started workin on my car 20 mins ago. This should be on the house. Ridiculous.
1443 2018-12-28 21:14:19 One instance where supplementing is better than eating the food is with Omega-3. Getting a purity certified fish oil is going to be both cheaper and safer than eating the equivalent amount of fatty fish.
1444 2018-12-28 21:14:10 Filled up my tank so now my car is only yelling at me to change my oil 
1445 2018-12-28 21:13:54 usa on the other hand, an oil company with the world's largest military
1446 2018-12-28 21:13:37 But taking cash from big oil, lying about it in the era of climate change isn’t a big deal at all and we should all soldier on like nothing is wrong. Got it.
1447 2018-12-28 21:13:36 Sitting here at the dealership waiting for my oil change-tire rotation appointment  eating goldfish. Still makes this adulting correct?

1461 2018-12-28 21:12:02 My chiropractor has brought me much relief over the years.  As a chemist I don’t believe in essential oils.  As a person, the essential oil vapors give me headaches.
1462 2018-12-28 21:12:01 LOL, almost. I would replace the baby oil with a water-based lotion, shea butter, argan oil, or coconut oil.

And, plis, not "sponge" o! Kain-kain! 'Tis a wonderful exfoliant.
1463 2018-12-28 21:11:57 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that

1465 2018-12-28 21:11:46 Something that never is brought up. When was the last time somebody paid $3.59 for a gallon of gas. Or oil. That was average of 8 years of Obama’s and I maybe lowballing. So people are Saving thousands of dollars a Year on gas and oil savings.

1471 2018-12-28 21:11:32 Was vegan tonight: Deliciously Ella's spicy beans with passata on rice. I used grated parsnip instead of grated carrot, and I doused it in olive oil before serving.
1472 2018-12-28 21:11:32 I do have a neurologist and a ketogenic nutritionist, who are experts. That's where I get my information.
Never once have they mentioned MCT oil or fat bombs.
1473 2018-12-28 21:11:21 When you have one party that uses oil money, why do you insist on tying the hands of the Dem party behind their back, just to please YOU.  You do what you can with what you have.

1478 2018-12-28 21:10:34 "Nancy is a master legislator and can get things done!" also "Reality is, Nancy can't do anything about big oil money until they  manage to get finance campaign reform.  That takes a massive effort,  that is more than just Nancy."
1479 2018-12-28 21:10:30 I’m not worried about GMOs. It’s the fact that Canola is not profitable and large organizations are leading lambs(farmers) to the slaughter.

1486 2018-12-28 21:09:57 Baby oil provides a nice superficial glisten, but isn't in fact hydrating. There is a greater risk of clogging pores and causing secondary skin issues, particularly on the face, if your skin is of an oily type.

It also requires a longer absorption time than shea butter or lotion

1492 2018-12-28 21:09:26 What relevance did your comment about big oil have? I’m pretty sure this post is about a wall and immigration reform which Bernie is a failure on.
1493 2018-12-28 21:09:12 I admit I am less concerned about Russia or Iran than Senator Graham. Mainly because I don't see much future for petrostates. 
But the need for US to drastically reduce its involvement in the ME is very pressing for me. I believe US will soon be oil exporter itself.
1494 2018-12-28 21:09:08 I love how vegans believe they have the moral high ground as if their almond milk and coconut milk/oil and palm oil doesn’t destroy forests and kill animals
1495 2018-12-28 21:09:08 Oh that part goes like clockwork; it’s just the actual getting the oil there that’s an issue. Told her she will be without heat until Monday.
1496 2018-12-28 21:09:07 ผู้เผยแพร่ลัทธิให้แก่ทุกคน 
1497 2018-12-28 21:09:00 Tenant3(me);landlord tell the dog not to protect me.i have olive oil and communion.
1498 2018-12-28 21:08:59 That's exactly why experts warn us by coconut oil. You wouldn't do heroin because meth is also bad for you, now would you? 
Such a strange argument.
1499 2018-12-28 21:08:59 I meant I don't want da coal plants in South America! for South America oil providers you must freeze all oil barriers wen delivering oil or we will not accept da oil!
1500 2018-12-28 21:08:58 I just booked an oil change
1501 2018-12-28 21:08:54 Put black castor oil on your eyebrows and brush them up with a spooly for thicker brows
1502 2018-12-28 21:08:53 I'm just worried about getting the oil substance out of my clothes
1503 2018-12-28 21:08:53 Soooo.. on some of the property I own a couple yrs ago I gave a company permission to dig... AND THESE MUFUCKAS HIT OIL!!! CUT THE FUCKIN CHECK BBY!!
1504 2018-12-28 21:08:52 Tfw you have so much ultramarine blue and titanium white gouache because you accidentally thought it was oil paint at a glance
1505 2018-12-28 21:08:49 Reality is, Nancy can't do anything about big oil money until they manage to get finance campaign reform.  That takes a massive effort, that is more than just Nancy.  Yes, climate change is a crisis.  We get that.
1506 2018-12-28 21:08:34 World Climate change will happen no matter what Canadians do to try to combat it.  I am not sure how the plastic manufactures will work, without oil, since all plastics are made from oil.
1507 2018-12-28 21:08:31 Oil has reached 45, time to check oil and energy again
1508 2018-12-28 21:08:19 So basically have a bath with a sponge, apply baby oil and finish off with vaseline....


1509 2018-12-28 21:08:07 I’m drenched in motor oil
1510 2018-12-28 21:07:56 Girl yes my daddy calls me from Cincinnati to tell me I need to go get an oil change! 
1511 2018-12-28 21:07:52 Wrong again Doug and Rick. Try the glut of oversupplied oil and  $40 barrel crude for low gas prices. The only thing the removal of cap&trade did was lower our integrity. @RickNichollsCKL #onpoli

1513 2018-12-28 21:07:46 Hi Steve I use brothers CBD oil to help manage both my back pain and mood, it's a little pricy but worth every penny
1514 2018-12-28 21:07:43 Caster has said she will decline contributions from coal, oil, and gas companies. I’m not that familiar with her — does she have a history of siding with petro companies over environmental concerns?
1515 2018-12-28 21:07:43 People: so how much oil do you put in? 
Me:  idk 
People: how much seasoning? 
Me: Idk 
 I seriously never measure anything when I cook so it’s hard to give out an accurate recipe.
1516 2018-12-28 21:07:37 “Unless that mans is gonna change my oil and fuck me... but that’s about it”
1517 2018-12-28 21:07:32 Omg I'm so sry to hear that. Make sure you get eucalyptus oil, put in a hot shower or pot of boiling water and breathe it.take care.
1518 2018-12-28 21:07:26 Best of luck ... oil & gas reserves are more than our expectations in offshore ...
1519 2018-12-28 21:07:18 ไปไหนนน
1520 2018-12-28 21:07:17 @permabear_uk what do you think about $PBR? Oil close to rebounce?
1521 2018-12-28 21:07:10 Facebook doesn't like CBD Oil too much does it... It's even been removed from the list of controlled substances (Farm Bill 2018) and they still treat it like it's a drug   smdh
1522 2018-12-28 21:07:00 4 dead in OHIO, Arab Oil Embargo, the beginning of the end for the middle class, too many people for too few jobs, Stagflation...why would you want to remember that? Oh...right...Trump is worse!
1523 2018-12-28 21:06:54 Plus I do CBD oil 2xs a day. Doesn’t do diddili for pain but helps with anxiety
1524 2018-12-28 21:06:54 I should oil my motorcycle... #MinkBot
1525 2018-12-28 21:06:46 ya’ll ever research what Oil is made of ?
1526 2018-12-28 21:06:25 Do you want to invade the country take its oil and use the money to build a country? Install our laws temporarily. That’s a solution
1527 2018-12-28 21:06:24 Yeeaahhh I’d be changing my oil myself from now on. At least your car should be good to go for a while from a bill like that
1528 2018-12-28 21:06:22 You most likely just need an oil change. The maintenance required light is installed so that people get scammed into taking their car into the dealership and thinking they need additional services. You can also reset your maintenance required light easily by looking it up online.
1529 2018-12-28 21:06:15 An essential oil diffuser.
1530 2018-12-28 21:06:08 Does he remember the BP oil spill
1531 2018-12-28 21:05:53 PINK Coconut oil body wash, 2 VS lip gloss, 1 VS matte lip color, VS Bombshell  & LOVE Rollerball Perfumes and a small makeup bag
1532 2018-12-28 21:05:53 people who oil pull are braver than the marines
1533 2018-12-28 21:05:44 That is where we disagree. Storylines alone don't do it. At some point, the ship has to turn north or it's all just window dressing.
1534 2018-12-28 21:05:43 Castor oil nii
1535 2018-12-28 21:05:43 Aww he is amazing, may i ask you what are you feeding him , i have a dane nd believe nutrition is a  big part in their lives, also u might want to try cbd oil from a company mybestbud, my friend gave to her dane nd he is doing 
1536 2018-12-28 21:05:41 Peppermint oil is a life saver for migraines wow
1537 2018-12-28 21:05:37 Allah ubanhiji ya Mata rahma
1538 2018-12-28 21:05:27 I just wish people in CLT would stop trying to sell me their shitty "wax" cartridges. The only thing thinner than the overly diluted oil inside is the glass surrounding it. I'm good love, enjoy
1539 2018-12-28 21:05:24 He accept donations from individuals who work in oil & gas industry which are biggest employers in Texas. Don’t distort facts.
1540 2018-12-28 21:05:23 うげ、ｽﾋﾟﾝﾄﾞﾙw
1541 2018-12-28 21:05:14 Help your #heart w/ a #Mediterranean diet! #Monounsaturated fats in beans/nuts & olive oil will keep blood pressure & cholesterol in check.
1542 2018-12-28 21:05:13 No it’s legit I’ve used one and have a convection microwave. I battered cauliflower and tofu and fried it without oil. Pretty wild stuff.
1543 2018-12-28 21:05:08 If there are no signs of excessive oil consumption,  no suspension knocks & the auto box shifts up & down as it should.....it may be worth a punt. Good luck with the viewing.
1544 2018-12-28 21:05:08 So is coconut oil. I’m not saying eat all the cholesterol in the world. I’m just saying, it can be high d/t genetics, muscle mass/physical activity, the remainder of the persons diet—not solely d/t dietary cholesterol intake and sometimes totally separate from. Eat what you want.
1545 2018-12-28 21:05:03 Have to get an oil change today ugh wish I could just do it myself
1546 2018-12-28 21:05:01 2. We don't know what the Select Committee's mandate will be. If what we're hearing is true, Dem leaders are pushing a Cte that:
 Has no subpoena power
 Allows electeds taking Big Oil $$
 Won't create a plan for a science-mandated, economic mobilization to stop the crisis
1547 2018-12-28 21:05:00 Was just at the grocery store where I bought paper towels, mushrooms, and lamp oil. Probably the most random three things I’ve ever purchased in my life.
1548 2018-12-28 21:05:00 Israel as a nation state is/was a German concept - most early settlers in British Palestine were German Jews with very strong nationalistic values. The Globalists co-opted the Israeli nation state for machining the current world order to take over oil supply/distro in Mideast
1549 2018-12-28 21:04:59 IT STILL SUCKS
Ive had my fair share of car repairs over the years. I cringe when I need an oil change.
1550 2018-12-28 21:04:56 While war-mongering neocons are whining about Syria, Russia  is giving financial aid to Venezuela - in exchange for control of some of its oil.
What could possibly go wrong?
1551 2018-12-28 21:04:54 Does she take money from oil companies? If she does then she should be disqualified
1552 2018-12-28 21:04:50 coconut oil
1553 2018-12-28 21:04:44 So you’re siding with someone who isn’t a Democrat vs. someone who sometimes votes against his party in favor of his own constituents? Btw, those oil & gas donations were from individuals who work at said companies.
1554 2018-12-28 21:04:40 Didn’t mention drop in gas prices and US now having largest oil reserves & production in world, recision of Iran deal by Obama to name a few.  If economy remains strong and people have more money in pockets, T will be re-elected in 2020 & GOP may take back House, God willing
1555 2018-12-28 21:04:14 Vaping 4% CBD-12%THC, stopped taking 4 prescriptions for anxiety and breathing problems. Don’t go to chiropractor and use CBD/THC OIl for neck pain. Stopped taking blood pressure meds through diet. Life is good!
1556 2018-12-28 21:04:06 @NancyPelosi & @TheDemocrats we're counting on you to make the Select Cte on Climate Change as strong as it can be. The Cte must:

1) Make a plan for a #GreenNewDeal
2) Ensure a #JustTransition for frontline communities
3) Have subpoena power
4) Have 0 ppl who take Big Oil $
1557 2018-12-28 21:04:05 Does that mean we get the oil diamonds and warm weather??
1558 2018-12-28 21:04:04 It's obvious to many that the actions Trudeau and the Liberal Party  have taken to destroy the oil Industry and Alberta economy are deliberate, why are politicians and media afraid to say so? #canpoli
1559 2018-12-28 21:03:59 To help this Renewable switch, an oil & gas price that reflected scarcity would be helpful. There is only 50 years of proven O&G reserves, while 50&70% of O&G reserves are guesstimates. Telling people earth will experience a climate switch this grand solar minimum would help too
1560 2018-12-28 21:03:58 Since you cant address every single individual, making a general observation. Party line here does ignore facts, barriers are effective, replaces the fact with emotion,"it's not who we are or they are cruel." if they dont work, why are they cruel/ immoral?
1561 2018-12-28 21:03:55 I don't think @Gus_802 and the Texas oil ppl understand that the world they are carelessly destroying is also made up of, you know, people. 
And that their jobs are going to be swept away VERY soon by the tsunami of renewables sweeping the world. Don't say u weren't warned.
1562 2018-12-28 21:03:46 If #stocks don't go vertical next week, #POTUS will ground all flights and ban all human movement until financial morale improves.   $spy $aapl $amzn $tsla $qqq $gold #oil #markets #equities

1565 2018-12-28 21:03:35 Genetics on ur side! Water helps detox me and coconut oil takes the rest! Botox was a mistake
1566 2018-12-28 21:03:34 Disagree, that’s the point of sports in general. Every year.
1567 2018-12-28 21:03:24 My parents bought a chest freezer in the 50's.  It was still working just fine until a flood in the year 2000!  AND low energy usage, something not even considered back then.  Energy was cheap.  Oil companies & GOP changed that.
1568 2018-12-28 21:03:01 @this_vid
1569 2018-12-28 21:02:36 I own a ton of $TFSL, and a little $NRIM in my basket as well. TFSL, being totally ignored by the market, never went down with the banking plunge this fall - that was nice. NRIM sadly exposed to this oil freefall but still performing solidly and oligopoly market in AK.
1570 2018-12-28 21:02:18 The story of oil is the story of the modern world. And this is the story of those who helped shape that world, and how the oil-igarchy they created is on the verge of monopolizing life itself.
1571 2018-12-28 21:02:18 OK.

Let me humor you, when it was designated for Oil and Gas operations,  the things the Oil Companies were clearing through the port, were they manufactured in Aba, Nnewi, Ibadan, Kaduna or Bauchi?

OK, they were clearing local gin.
1572 2018-12-28 21:02:14 Only for falling oil pressure. Never liked him but it would have been good to see him win that race
1573 2018-12-28 21:02:09 @DonBraid I have a solution to our oil glut. Alberta will ship oil to Quebec by rail as an alternative to sending money as equalization payments. #WinWin
1574 2018-12-28 21:02:09 Chop onions. Tomatoes. Heat tsp oil in kadai, crackle mustard seeds, roast/fry onions light brown, add tomatoes -cook; add salt & red chilli powder to taste, simmer. toast 2 slices bread on tava with ghee, spread the tomato onion filling between slices, eat tastiest "toast" ever!
1575 2018-12-28 21:02:08 From farm to pharmaceutical, diesel truck to dinner plate, pipeline to plastic product, it is impossible to think of an area of our modern-day lives that is not affected by the oil industry.
1576 2018-12-28 21:02:07 made salsa macha and i didn't feel nothing even after i put like six spoonfuls into my soup and it's basically chile oil what the fuck am i
1577 2018-12-28 21:02:04 What was your favorite Winter's Veil gift? I got some new arclight spanners that have little flashlights on the end, some new leather oil, and this nifty tankard that magically refills itself!
1578 2018-12-28 21:02:00 Charge Justin trudeau,  jean chretian and stop them from  clear cutting my property and drilling for oil cement all drill g sites and no tracking and stop p,after MInning because it'll be done my way only and all property inheritance to me that people have added things to ceryi
1579 2018-12-28 21:01:58 Life Tip:
When you buy a new car you must replace the radiant coolant by 60,000 miles depending on the manufacture. Didn’t know this and my car almost overheated. I thought it was just my oil needing changed.
1580 2018-12-28 21:01:57 Pushing flame scorched limos to the oil rig tonight, for the promenade dance
1581 2018-12-28 21:01:53 Love my patients, I literally have 20+ notes and one of my last pts brought me in a lavender essential oil
1582 2018-12-28 21:01:37 Peppermint essential oil, water, drop of soap. Gets rid of them. Worked in MD so should work in your place too.
1583 2018-12-28 21:01:34 @basser_ chasing and getting it low until oil is back up in spring/summer.. award me 2 time already 2018. Let see 2019
1584 2018-12-28 21:01:22 so @NancyPelosi - select committee needs:
1) A real mandate to develop a plan for a Green New Deal
2) Have subpoena power 
3) Ask Democratic officials to take the #NoFossilFuelMoney pledge, and reject $$$ from oil and gas executives and lobbyists who jeopardize our futures.
1585 2018-12-28 21:01:21 My nigga I been shaving! I thought beard oil helps if you have a beard 
1586 2018-12-28 21:01:19 Boy I sure love bringing my car in for an oil change and leaving with nearly $1000 in maintenance...
1587 2018-12-28 21:01:18 Throw enough butter or whatever oil you use and seasonings on it after and it's almost like chicken. Almost. I much prefer gator as a healthy meat because it's like really juicy chicken but you cant find it up here.
1588 2018-12-28 21:01:02 I’ve been here for almost two hours and my oil isn’t changed
1589 2018-12-28 21:01:01 Day 2 of CBD oil usage and i'm already listening to Ozric Tentacles and really feeling it. Day 2! smh
1590 2018-12-28 21:00:50 Is he supposed to had his chest hair removed, spray tanned and covered in oil? Yuck.
1591 2018-12-28 21:00:33 Start shaving and get beard oil
1592 2018-12-28 21:00:33 Baby oil? Eskiss sah. a whole Baby Boy like you jus fallin' hand laideez?

We exfoliate to shed dead skin, then bathe, then moisturize deeply, then apply a sealant layer. And we hydrate to combat ashculinity from within, while choosing clothing that limits the wind on our skin!
1593 2018-12-28 21:00:27 coconut oil, castor oil, & vitamin E oil
1594 2018-12-28 21:00:26 Nope ha...the oil change this time...my knee feels ok...gotta tackle stairs still
1595 2018-12-28 21:00:25 Bitch with to many mileage need to get they oil changed
1596 2018-12-28 21:00:24 Anyone good oil tycoon investors!
Please give me money!
1597 2018-12-28 21:00:23 Do they understand at all? Oil is their definition of economy. Little do they realize that wealth is now portable,it is a knowledge economy globally
1598 2018-12-28 21:00:14 My car got stuck in the snow (in a driveway) for the first time ever, and it’s nearing the mileage for another oil change. Might as well buy a whole new one. 
1599 2018-12-28 20:59:58 まさかドライブが逝った…とか
1600 2018-12-28 20:59:54 เจ้าแม่ออย สาวกตัวจริง

1602 2018-12-28 20:59:35 Paid 500 bucks for 3 plates of momos and I get stale chicken used in them with a spoilt chutney and loads of oil in the momos. Totally disappointed with the service @ZomatoIN

1604 2018-12-28 20:59:32 Didn’t mean to marginalize you & sorry for the disrespect. Have read too many critiques of candidates who may have taken eg 500 dollars from people who work for oil companies in Texas etc which supposedly disqualify them by Bernie supporters today. Exhausting attack on Beto. Etc
1605 2018-12-28 20:59:25 I Would NEVER Give My Kid Grapefruit Oil For Cystic Acne!
1606 2018-12-28 20:59:22 Girls don’t check the tires, oil or nun  they get in the car and pull off
1607 2018-12-28 20:59:14 I hate coconuts but the coconut oil we have has 0 oder or taste
1608 2018-12-28 20:59:12 It simply and if as you claim oil is no longer what feed nigerians. Then let your so called govmnt allow resources control. Let Niger delta control their resources and pay tax to the government
1609 2018-12-28 20:59:10 Lol I was just gonna say did the use it as a oil catch pan at jiffy lube?
1610 2018-12-28 20:58:54 Where's the essential oil that can give people a sense of shame?
1611 2018-12-28 20:58:39 We don't yet know what the Select Committee's mandate will be. If what we're hearing is true, Dem leaders are pushing a committee that: 
 Has no subpoena power
 Allows officials to take oil $ 
 Won't create a plan for a science-mandated, economic mobilization to stop crisis
1612 2018-12-28 20:58:34 StickyWow - Stinka Oil
1613 2018-12-28 20:58:06 Oil is a terrible business and can easily and fairly receive mush if not most of the credit for destroying itself. That’s said by someone who works every day to end it. We just can’t take all the credit. Just like the rock oil business couldn’t take credit for saving the whales.
1614 2018-12-28 20:58:03 The way our Northern girls love dating guys that have cars these days. You'd think they were breastfed with engine oil
1615 2018-12-28 20:57:58 Truth be told
This year wasn't a disappointing one for Phynofino!
N.W.A was fuc*ing dope
FUWA SEWA was lit
IWA was an Anthem
OIL still a banger
If you aren't an Easterner, you may understand his lyrics but you can't relate to it.
1616 2018-12-28 20:57:37 And to Luke’s point, would you not expect to see such attempts to replace dollars with other currencies collateralized with gold show up in the gold oil ratio?

Hasn’t that been validating both the attempts, and their success, in replacing dollars in oil trade?
1617 2018-12-28 20:57:34 อย่าลืมให้เครดิตบิกเเฟนกับกูด้วยนะ
1618 2018-12-28 20:57:31 We can pump shit tar sand garbage oil to Texas but not water to Las Vegas or Gallup, NM.

Horse shit.
1619 2018-12-28 20:57:27 It’s a private market and it’s not allowed in our democracy to run the industry like a cartel.  Oil companies need to pump oil to make money to pay the bills that’s how a private business works.
1620 2018-12-28 20:57:25 Does anyone know an oil company that may deliver on the weekend that does 200 min? That’s not aable??
1621 2018-12-28 20:57:23 this oil treatment at some spa place i swear i want it done weekly but i’m poor lol
1622 2018-12-28 20:57:12 My source is actually a family member who works high up in oil and gas and spends a lot of time working back and forth between here and China. I’m not sure if it’s actually been publicly released yet or not but I consider him (at least personally) a credible source for sure
1623 2018-12-28 20:57:07 Wanna try out oil painting but that shit seems BIG HARD
1624 2018-12-28 20:57:02 Crude oil futures for February mixed Friday afternoon, $WTI_Crude +1.28% at $45.18 & $NBZ_F +0.08% at $52.20, $USO -0.99% at $9.52 on 12/28/2018.
1625 2018-12-28 20:57:00 I literally am at a piont in life where I say I’m just “supporting local businesses” but really I’m just fed up with adult hood. 

Aka paying for: oil changes, car detailers/washers, dog walkers/sitters/ house cleaners, carpet shampooers, organizers. 

Lazy af shit I’ve done
1626 2018-12-28 20:56:57 "Most" as you put it is estimated to be 40% and used purely as a diversion. It's easy solvable. Any accounts receivable program can track how many days amount is open.
Barriers are tactical, create choke points and are force/ resource multipliers.
1627 2018-12-28 20:56:53 @itsSamCollins can you talk about the different oils T can be suspended in pls!! I didn’t know this and just found out that I’m allergic to the oil mine is suspended it.
1628 2018-12-28 20:56:47 @JoMaloneLondon bought the dark amber and ginger lily dry body oil after reading @JaneTorville loves it and wow not disappointed it lasts all day and smells Divine xx
1629 2018-12-28 20:56:43 I remember being at the Edmonton gardens and Doug Soetart was Oil Kings goaltender and whoever scored us kids cheered lol that was in I think around 1970
1630 2018-12-28 20:56:40 The substation is right next to the plant and while a transformer problem, as authorities originally identified it, is relatively agnostic to the fuel source, the proximity and continued use of No. 6 fuel oil raised new concerns among everyone I spoke to about whole operation
1631 2018-12-28 20:56:22 I think the Military industrial complex will have far more business elsewhere. The ME will rapidly decline in importance to the West as the oil age ends in the next few decades.
1632 2018-12-28 20:56:14 Their machine has lost it's oil of course

In football.... you are as good as ur last match
1633 2018-12-28 20:56:12 One oil block will solve little of my needs right now.
1634 2018-12-28 20:56:06 .@NancyPelosi & @TheDemocrats we're counting on you to make the Select Cte on Climate Change as strong as it can be. The Cte must:

1) Make a plan for a #GreenNewDeal
2) Ensure a #JustTransition for frontline communities
3) Have subpoena power
4) Have 0 ppl who take Big Oil $
1635 2018-12-28 20:56:05 Tells u everything about ur garbage party when u have to "force it" on them to do something about the CLIMATE CRISIS. Ur big tent has more space for Big Oil lobbyists than people trying to get something done about the CLIMATE CRISIS (have I emphasized enough that it's a CRISIS?)
1636 2018-12-28 20:56:03 .@FairQuestions has done more to uncover this seedy anti oil money transfers than anyone. To say she is a conspiracy theorist is - well *tin foil hatter*
1637 2018-12-28 20:55:58 beef bacon taste like burnt oil 
1638 2018-12-28 20:55:57 Canada’s changing legislation makes the oil & gas sector increasingly uneconomical, the rigs are going to Texas and shale E&P. There is #environmental value here but #economic and #employment disruption which will enable populist parties. Be careful @Canada
1639 2018-12-28 20:55:39 Hitch knew what he was getting into...he is no dummy.
1640 2018-12-28 20:55:39 Burodi is our heritage, its a vertebrae and an integral part of our culture and identity, never disrespect bread again.
1641 2018-12-28 20:55:38 Doesn't take clues or a clues closet to follow the trend of the OPEC and the top producing oil countries all agreeing to slash their supply because of the over supply.  But lemme guess a pipeline in Canada would fix ALL of that? LMFAO, quit drinking the kool-aid. #divest
1642 2018-12-28 20:55:35 Not to mention the oil..
1643 2018-12-28 20:55:31 They are in Morocco.
They are eating the fruits of the trees, then the digested nuts are 'recycled' to make oil.
1644 2018-12-28 20:55:23 Example.......Texas.....Houstin and Climate Change has nothing to do with missed opportunity.  If you can pipe Oil you can pump water from Katy to West Texas.  Opportunity.

No vision is the problem.  Just Political Hacktivism aimed at division and loss of common sense.
1645 2018-12-28 20:55:19 Even though no one asked, my art inspiration/influences would be Toulouse Lautrec with a hint of Egon Schiele (drawing wise) while my oil paintings I usually look at Francis bacon 
1646 2018-12-28 20:55:17 Is another AHA moment but this time his puppeteers like Aliyu Gusau, Ibrahim Babangida aka evil genius etc sponsored the coup and looked for a leader with requisite qualities to head the Govt. Oil and water cannot mix thus the obvious departure. AA cannot use coup to spite #PMB
1647 2018-12-28 20:55:15 I need to neem some of my plants too, do you buy the pure neem oil and make your own spray? I have the premade one but it has lots of toxicity warnings and I'm worried about Lucy
1648 2018-12-28 20:55:13 Finally gotten a oil change I needed!! Love how I can get coupons mail to me because my oil change is a fucking arm & a leg light way
1649 2018-12-28 20:55:01 This GOP administration doesn't care if Americans die from mercury and other toxic emissions from coal and oil fired power plants as long as there is profit to be made for the big conglomerates.

1650 2018-12-28 20:54:51 hello virgo sun cancer moon & 6th house stellium here!! my tips:
-have all the food, drinks, plates, cups everything out and accessible 
-make a playlist you know everyone that’s invited will vibe with 
-have a super clean bathroom w fresh hand towels and an oil diffuser!!
1651 2018-12-28 20:54:47 If it wasn't for oil none of us would have ever heard of Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq. #SpiritualDisease
1652 2018-12-28 20:54:34 ok but have u tried cbd oil tho
1653 2018-12-28 20:54:31 CBD oil is legal in Indiana now. I tried some for insomnia last night. It seems promising. #cbdoil
1654 2018-12-28 20:54:24 woW fun fact seasame oil is far more aromatic than most oils I used a few drops of it for some chicken and the kitchen smells like peanuts that shat themselves
1655 2018-12-28 20:54:18 Or perhaps some orange oil #BoostTorbay
1656 2018-12-28 20:54:16 Shea moisture for sure. You can get the pack with the wash, oil, and detangler on Amazon.
1657 2018-12-28 20:54:13 Use a non-oily beard moisturizer after bath or face wash so that it doesn't leave your face oily.

And beard oil before bed :)

Also enjoy stroking your beard now and then (to get over itching psychologically :p )
1658 2018-12-28 20:54:00 But let’s not diminish the role of lobbying… which has likely been ongoing, according to unearthed letters and studies by oil companies for the better part of 50 years. Psychology is more of a symptom. Lobbying is a direct cause of much pain and lack of serious climate action.
1659 2018-12-28 20:54:00 Corporations cannot donate directly to candidates ffs. These are individuals listing the companies who employ them. Obviously people in Texas are going to be employed in the oil industry 
1660 2018-12-28 20:53:51 EESH now who is bad at math.
It's actually about equal
Yet oil companies pay out billions as well. Worth trillions.
Koch brothers own several media companies and research labs specifically to deny actual science. They are a large scale threat.
1661 2018-12-28 20:53:41 It beeth what it beeth. Without the oil the wheels cannot turneth. I'm a happy man. No stress. That's valuable 
1662 2018-12-28 20:53:09 I said global oil surplus destroyed their economy, not them not producing enough. They were producing plenty. It's just that the price had become so cheap, it couldn't support their economy anymore.

1665 2018-12-28 20:52:54 Jesus - the macros she has listed are for epilepsy, not regular people. MCT oil in coffee and fat bombs? Did she get her info from Facebook? Bloody hell.
1666 2018-12-28 20:52:46 Slight correction Brian...he was a "fantastic player"...end of discussion 
1667 2018-12-28 20:52:44 Gas. water. electricity. telephones. post office. Local government. Oil. Nuclear power generation. Gvnmt departments. NHS. There are lots more as well.
1668 2018-12-28 20:52:33 I’m sufficiently grizzled enough to no longer get the upsale pitch at the oil change joint.
1669 2018-12-28 20:52:25 What’s going on with it? I know you can’t speak on it much, bc your job & shit. But like is it oil over there we want & can’t find? Lmao
1670 2018-12-28 20:52:24 You are not insane in Jesus name..... Let me go and brung olive oil so that you will drink‍‍‍
1671 2018-12-28 20:52:14 Even tho i don't like oil paints much, I kinda want to start doing more oil paintings anyway
1672 2018-12-28 20:52:05 The macros you have listed here are for medical keto, which is what I'm on for my epilepsy. Your average human doing this for health/weight loss purposes do not need to be that strict. Never once have I put MCT oil in my coffee nor had fat bombs. This evaluation is very cliché.
1673 2018-12-28 20:52:03 The oil??
1674 2018-12-28 20:51:54 is that because of the oil change, or your knee?

1676 2018-12-28 20:51:21 I love that America is having a debate about if renewable energy is worth pursuing. 

I mean what if we’re wrong and we never run out of oil. Then we will have build a better future and a better world for NO REASON

1679 2018-12-28 20:51:13 Argan oil is great! it's not sticky and absorbs well. I've read castor oil is good too but it's really thick and sticky so I'm still figuring out the best way to use it 
1680 2018-12-28 20:51:08 That’s not the reason their economy crashed though. Socialism ranked their economy, not a lack of oil production.
1681 2018-12-28 20:50:57 oil change , grocery shop , clean my house .. etc
1682 2018-12-28 20:50:56 To be fair, it shouldn't be like a television series. The days of so many storylines holding the masses interest should've passed long ago. At some point, the turn around has to begin and the fact they are in year four of McDavid and still in this mess is rather disheartening.

1684 2018-12-28 20:50:34 Use the doTerra essential oil. The lavender one is amazing
1685 2018-12-28 20:50:18 You should add olive oil to that as a base tho
1686 2018-12-28 20:50:02 I haven’t put not nan lic of oil in it either 
1687 2018-12-28 20:49:58 Worked 630 to 330. Off to have a oil change to keep my warranty then back to work to close  I can do this. And ty Abby

1697 2018-12-28 20:48:48 Contributed massively to our economic woes as a country. Oil boom during is his time and letting everyone know oil is the new cocoa, made everyone abandon agriculture. Who goes on national t.v. making stupid announcement about oil

1700 2018-12-28 20:48:40 I got to watch most of #YR today in the dealership waiting for my oil change and I have to say it was a great script! I laughed out loud multiple times from quips, reactions, etc. Nick letting his Victor out was excellent.

1702 2018-12-28 20:48:36 Sounds delicious. Think I added the oil too fast and it split rather than emulsify. Didn't have time to make more so cheated.
1703 2018-12-28 20:48:28 Balsamic vinegar and soy sauce and a bit of olive oil. Lovely.

1709 2018-12-28 20:47:42 No the big problem is we have too much supply from growing profitable oil production and light oil is growing fast over the last few years as well.  2010  production was 3.5 million bpd 2018 4.9 million bpd with the cancelled northern gateway that stopped contracted oil shipin

1723 2018-12-28 20:46:20 went to get my oil changed and they come out and tell me i need 3 new tires, brakes and rotors. i think i’ll just go get a pedi and not worry bout all the money i’m gonna need 
1724 2018-12-28 20:46:15 Same people that ate Odili's money ensured he never became VP to Yaradua. Odili spent oil money from Rivers to Sokoto, when Stella died he made a whole fleet of taxis in PH in her memory, but when it was time to recoup his investment they chose GEJ.

1730 2018-12-28 20:45:34 yes, because most people in the sacrifice zone don't work in oil and gas, nor do they see a commensurate return on the value of the extracted minerals
1731 2018-12-28 20:45:32 at Sephora and this like 12 year old girl and her friends are talking.

1733 2018-12-28 20:45:26 Nope. Still wrong. And still confused about the diff between cap & trade and a carbon tax. You have nothing to do with the plunge in global oil prices. But you are responsible for Ont's credit downgrade as a result of slashing of revenue sources (like cap & trade).
1734 2018-12-28 20:45:21 for dry hair

1735 2018-12-28 20:45:15 I say the same exact thing. Name a couple friends of yours that can actually change their own oil or a flat tire. Very few. So in return they're not teaching their kids either. 
Local dirt tracks suffer because of this as well.  Interest is not there....

1762 2018-12-28 20:42:38 He think he'd become Senate President, loool. They'd never see him for more than who they think he is, an upstart who got lucky with the oil boom. He should learn from Peter Odili. Sadly history repeats itself.
1763 2018-12-28 20:42:24 The Mideast oil is easier to extract, cheaper to refine etc...and there’s the dilemma.
1764 2018-12-28 20:42:10 Shehu shagari was one of our problems. He announced oil is sufficient for Nigeria, made everyone abandoned agriculture. Made greedy people see oil as the only option and They looted the country. Not my MCM 
1765 2018-12-28 20:42:09 I guess you know what lead to the 1983 coup....incase you don't know,  it was due to the corruption in the finance sector........after creating the kaduna oil refinery

I stole it and used it as my body cream for a week.
Dnt ask me what happened?
1771 2018-12-28 20:41:22 We can hope it's more than a blip.  Alternative energy sources continue to grow, and become more competitive with fossil fuels every day.

Canada, we don't want your filthy tar sands oil.  Leave it in the ground where it belongs!

1778 2018-12-28 20:40:44 When your administration is filled with coal , oil and gas lobbyists this is what you get.
1779 2018-12-28 20:40:43 Granted reason all these historically separate regions, different cultures, backgrounds were thrown together was bc they were poor!  Then oil! !  Tribes you say, like Tuareg w/empty unfilled promises? Tebu? Amazigh he wanted to do genocide? Berbers? Barqah tribes? No, very few
1780 2018-12-28 20:40:40 Could cut a substantial amount of emissions with a national project to convert home heating systems that currently use oil (# 2 Diesel) or kerosene boilers to gas or renewables, which would likely be electric heat running off cleanly produced electricity, i.e. solar, wind, hydro.
1781 2018-12-28 20:40:37 I think this is the open net that this guy missed and the oil went the other way and scored.

1796 2018-12-28 20:38:59 Actually if you think about it, their nation relied on oil, so they needed higher oil prices, but then came gobal glut of oil through record U.S. shale production, that basically put their economy out of bussiness.
1797 2018-12-28 20:38:37 Beard oil gives me ingrown hairs. Beard balm is nice but tasting it every now and then is annoying. Maybe it's my brand (Maestros). Shea butter is a bit better. Fewer (but not zero) ingrown hairs, no taste issue. Got any advice for someone whose skin hates oil?
1798 2018-12-28 20:38:34 [...], distribution, or sale of oil, gas, or coal. We will provide a list of these companies upon request.
1799 2018-12-28 20:38:32 I’ve worked in oil for a long time. There will be a story to come out of this. This is not standard flaring. They likely had to burn something off to avoid a near incident.
1800 2018-12-28 20:38:25 Make sure nobody not hitting you with that holy oil while you sleeping

1802 2018-12-28 20:38:18 So Rex, a "journalist" with a history of taking oil money (for paid speech), is practically justifying the murder and cutting to pieces of another journalist who challenged oil money. Can't make this stuff up. Did you wait to think how this even looks or you can't think anymore?
1803 2018-12-28 20:38:14 I hate oil changes.
1804 2018-12-28 20:38:09 And the social welfare programs, which were initially put in place by Chavez, worked for a while until oil prices dropped and they could no longer sustain the programs. Their economy was too dependent on a volatile market. In a diverse economy they could have had more success.
1805 2018-12-28 20:38:09 The oil industry does 2 things really well: polluting, and denying it.
1806 2018-12-28 20:38:05 Best of luck Pakistan drilling will be started soon for the discovery of oil and gas and this discovery can be a real game changer..

1819 2018-12-28 20:35:54 Secrecy in the award of licenses for oil marginal fields in Nigeria and the discretionary powers of the president & Petroleum Minister is a major problem. 

Nigeria must embrace #OpenOilLicense to fix up.
1820 2018-12-28 20:35:53 Cooking oil?
1821 2018-12-28 20:35:35 @KamalaHarris We know it’s not right.. I’ve been through this as a teenager when my Dad , who worked for the ShipYard. they shut down and our whole life changed..No money to pay bills , lights , oil, mortgage  and I remember people who knew about us, left food at our door,
1822 2018-12-28 20:35:35 That isn't a counter to my argument. The US held oil fields, electricity production and agricultural land. Major cities like Aleppo are rubble.
The US does not need to topple Assad nor commit anything more. What was left was political settlement and negotiations. US had a seat.

1825 2018-12-28 20:35:17 It will happen without bloodshed when Southern crude oil dries up. Northern Nigeria themselves will push for it day and night.

Crude oil is one Nigeria.

1828 2018-12-28 20:35:02 At this point @JCrume22 and I are just critiquing Nissan Stadium, and let me just say, it’s no Lucas Oil
1829 2018-12-28 20:35:01 why does looking at animals covered in oil make me sad, but looking at animals covered in oil and deep-fried make me hungry?
1830 2018-12-28 20:34:46 Nothing gives me more anxiety than pulling into an oil change place
1831 2018-12-28 20:34:43 Wild hair growth oil and JBCO
1832 2018-12-28 20:34:39 Typo.  The complaints about Beto's donations coming from the fossil fuel industry is based on employees of those companies making donations.  Oil and gas companies are major employers in TX, should their employees not donate to candidates?
1833 2018-12-28 20:34:39 "The best way to control the opposition is to lead it."

They want to be in charge of our anti-climate change initiatives to make sure they fail, and Russia continues to make a profit on oil and Putin gets his Arctic passage.
1834 2018-12-28 20:34:32 in nuclear energy we are freeing oil that we can export and get more money. This will increase foreign currency (by selling more oil) that comes to our financial system and decrease foreign currency that leave our system (by not importing more diesel)
1835 2018-12-28 20:34:30 It needs two mudflaps due to the massive oil leak all the engines have
1836 2018-12-28 20:34:28 I need an oil change

1850 2018-12-28 20:33:19 Bob didn't rip him and nor do I expect him too, as he works for the club but Spec certainly did. He actually questioned whether the team is actually any better today than when Chiarelli took it over.

1864 2018-12-28 20:31:32 Truth. As much as I wish they would move away from the McDrai combo... bigger issues are forcing them back to it over and over.
1865 2018-12-28 20:31:17 Our shimmering body oil is lightweight, non-greasy and smells amazing!! And the bottle is MASSIVE!! Half price until the end of December or until stocks last.
1866 2018-12-28 20:31:13 Luke, futures is not physical. Oil Physical market is very very different from exchange traded futures. Volumes are not necessarily indication of underlying deliveries...

1868 2018-12-28 20:31:02 When Chavez was elected the poverty rate in Venezuela was ~68%, today it is ~80%.  If you ignore crashing oil prices and have zero intellectual integrity you can attribute that change entirely to redistributive policies.
1869 2018-12-28 20:30:36 Right behind tires and oil changes my biggest vehicle expense is headlights. Buying 2 bulbs today because I drive a GM 1 ton.

1882 2018-12-28 20:29:08 I have epilepsy, researched cannabis oil. It stops my shaking within minutes & I'm old. The testimonials are up.

1883 2018-12-28 20:28:57 Its time to grow WAY more hemp to use in making cloth and many other items that are now being made with oil.
1884 2018-12-28 20:28:41 I lived in California. The extraction process itself is what makes it non-organic. I talked to people who run good CBD companies who disclosed all of this. The plant might be organic, but the manufacturing of the oil isn't, in all cases. I can share these convos with you.

1888 2018-12-28 20:28:12 It's a delicate balance, you need to be confident and believe in yourself so others follow suit. But be kind and humble additionally. Almost oil and water at times.

1894 2018-12-28 20:27:39 @pladis_Global hi! Love your products especially Jacobs range - the twiglets and mini cheddars but I notice you use *Palm Oil* in these & other products in your range.... Are you aware of the problems caused by palm plantations and are you looking to switch to an alternative?
1895 2018-12-28 20:27:38 idk if u still need this but I started using jojoba oil in the mornings and tea tree oil at night and it changed my skin !!
1896 2018-12-28 20:27:32 My light for an oil change came on yesterday and I’m getting it changed rn... look at me being responsible 
1897 2018-12-28 20:27:31 my mom told me “if i ever teach u anything it’s to never forget two things : an oil change and birth control”
1898 2018-12-28 20:27:28 Собираюсь жениться на женщине, которая может узнать Гуфа по голосу (но это секрет!!!)

1899 2018-12-28 20:27:20 As of today Canada has just 15 rigs drilling for oil, following a drop of 43 last week.
1900 2018-12-28 20:26:51 You are FOS world oil glut and winter grade.
1901 2018-12-28 20:26:44 No doubt if not for Mcdavid this team would really be in a pickle 
1902 2018-12-28 20:26:38 I had to get an oil change today but I crashed my car yesterday and totaled it so Ig it’s not necessary anymore
1903 2018-12-28 20:26:37 Make the wall a business transaction. Similar to sec companies that win bids on gov. contracts to go to war zones or oil companies. Rent from property owners. Firm provides pvt. sec. builds wall. Must be a $ gain in this wall all around for companies, residents and even our gov.
1904 2018-12-28 20:26:35 And that's an indicator of a bigger problem: erosion of depth. Especially on the wings.
1905 2018-12-28 20:26:24 Yea the oil well man
1906 2018-12-28 20:26:08 Sorry, Sirota is a journalist whose articles you can't show are incorrect. Tanden is a monster who wanted to blackmail Libya--who Hillary and Obama destroyed for oil--and is backed by the murderous UAE. The fact you compare them to each other shows how wrong you are
1907 2018-12-28 20:25:57 Exactly! Interesting that their focus in Canada is so much on climate causes, whereas elsewhere,  even in oil producing countries, they don't seem ver concerned. One sided
1908 2018-12-28 20:25:48 50$ a barrell is a fact. You rarely see any Nationalist post about facts. It's a lot like oil and water, Nats and facts. 
They deal more in hope and unicorns.
1909 2018-12-28 20:25:43 The oil well man?
1910 2018-12-28 20:25:26 You can’t smoke in public areas *** . Thc oil is concentrated so it’s not class d it’s worse
1911 2018-12-28 20:25:17 Sorry to be the broker of bad news, but there actually is no CBD oil on the market, also from cannibis, that is organic. I spent a lot of time researching this for my own health. There are no organic extraction processes yet. And the industry allows companies to lie.
1912 2018-12-28 20:25:15 Add red oil and issa goal
1913 2018-12-28 20:25:12 Say no to Grapeseed oil!
1914 2018-12-28 20:25:09 Wow what a mood. We ran out of oil earlier in the month and then when we got some Christmas Eve and went to turn the heating on nothing happened and the pipes have been making weird noises!! And because we’re in the countryside the house is exposed as well 
1915 2018-12-28 20:25:08 Crissssstine! I have some idea for challanging video! 24 h with naked nails, no base/top coat, you can use nail oil or hand cream. All day in work and home! What do you think?? @nailogical
1916 2018-12-28 20:25:08 “Spreading the offence around” with is a recipe for losing anyone who’s played a high level knows with a shallow roster it dilutes and worse if you can’t defend. who are these two supposed to have for wingers if split up? The drop off is too steep
1917 2018-12-28 20:25:05 Seeing @NandhiniRad after months away from each other...

Nands: "What did you do yesterday?"
Me: "I went on a tour of my uncle's oil palm and coconut plantation."
Nands: "...so fucking Malaysian."

1919 2018-12-28 20:24:59 Hmmnnn....  I no-go mind epp you oil am one of these days shar
1920 2018-12-28 20:24:57 I just complain to change the Liquid Gun engine oil to something more better FULLY SYNTHETIC OR SEMI SYNTHETIC from world class manufacturer except that HP wastes.
1921 2018-12-28 20:24:44 @HamidMirPAK don’t worry China will take it over and you guys will be scratching you empty head. Pakistani and it’s government are so dumb to drill oil which intimately will go to China.
1922 2018-12-28 20:24:38 Oil prices went down, hence its down
1923 2018-12-28 20:24:33 Started using a new face wash that’s supposed to clear acne and control oil but instead I’m breaking out and all shiny 
1924 2018-12-28 20:24:23 Way too much oil 
1925 2018-12-28 20:24:12 Ayam selling engine oil Oga 
1926 2018-12-28 20:24:08 According to CBC, the oil industry is hurting due to low prices and how Alberta oil is hard to refine.    This accounts for all the carnage in our oil industry and not government policy.   I know it is true as Rosie O’Donnel said so.
1927 2018-12-28 20:23:54 I am now a firm believer in synthetic oil
1928 2018-12-28 20:23:53 If his tongue has never made you lock up like an ‘87 impala with no oil he ain’t for you booboo
1929 2018-12-28 20:23:52 stuck an olbas oil stick up my nose and forgot about it and now one nostril feels like the Arctic
1930 2018-12-28 20:23:52 i payed for a conventional oil change but my sticker marked high mileage  now idk if it's actually time for my oil change or not
1931 2018-12-28 20:23:48 *Minding my business cleaning beer lines*

Creepy old man: “Sure looks like you know how to use yer hands.” Condescendingly, “You change the oil in your car too?”

Me: *death glare* “As a matter of fact I do. I also changed the fuel pump too.”

Stop being creepy, men.
1932 2018-12-28 20:23:48 It's so easy to see through people like this and yet so many buy the damn Snake Oil.
1933 2018-12-28 20:23:48 Tea tree oil or calamine lotion!!
1934 2018-12-28 20:23:47 my oil diffuser ain’t working :/ where’s ms.muno when u need her
1935 2018-12-28 20:23:42 Is she posing for an oil painting?
1936 2018-12-28 20:23:32 It's appeared that way for some time now
1937 2018-12-28 20:23:15 Definitely found a coupon code for my oil change. 50 is a rip off for something i need 
1938 2018-12-28 20:23:12 Reduce fossil fuels YES! The @Hyundai_UK i35 fuel cell car is ready now but there are only 4 hydrogen stations in the U.K. why is that? Because the oil companies wish to maintain their industry. Climate change! Then Gov create the infrastructure. Tax revenues on fuel - ah well!
1939 2018-12-28 20:22:54 1. Try performing yoga for at least 10 minutes. 
2. Take a bowl and pour a cup of water and 5 - 10 drops of lavender essential oil. Lavender supposedly helps relax your nerves and it helps to fall asleep. 
3. Spray lavender mist onto your pillow if you’d like.
1940 2018-12-28 20:22:52 The Exiles will be in The Barrels in Owen Street to oil our vocal chords before the game. Let's see an away win!
1941 2018-12-28 20:22:47 You realize that this includes everyone employed for an oil or gas company, which, in Texas, is a large percentage of the population. The fact that you are presenting this a money from or paid at the direction of the industry, when it is not, tells me all I need to know about you
1942 2018-12-28 20:22:39 Since ECB is not the fiscal agent for a European Treasury (as has always been central to the € project) it couldn't be anything other than a subjectively valued token, which could be (& in my view will have been from January 2015 to next week) printed for oil imports
1943 2018-12-28 20:22:31 rubbing alcohol & tea tree oil :)
1944 2018-12-28 20:22:23 ugh I need an oil change
1945 2018-12-28 20:22:02 @TheBodyShopUK send her some free tea tree oil!! she recommends it a lot and needs some ;)
1946 2018-12-28 20:22:02 bet'oil
1947 2018-12-28 20:22:02 The fact we are talking about the Oilers needing to go out and find a top six impact winger is staggering...Jesus Christ 
1948 2018-12-28 20:22:01 Happy friday guys!! I have muy cam open for u ;) today oil show!
1949 2018-12-28 20:21:52 I’m not a popular prophet but I have oil! Lord I just want to get my work done
1950 2018-12-28 20:21:46 Fossil fuel-owned Dems have had several chances over the years and they’ve failed every time. I’d love to be surprised, but I’d rather just replace them with reps who aren’t owned by the oil execs profiting off of the destruction of our environment.

1953 2018-12-28 20:21:32 Rose oil. Coconut oil. Cab Sav. Moroccan oil deep conditioning hair mask. Green tea face mask. Sifi movie.
1954 2018-12-28 20:21:16 What kind of oil do you recommend?
1955 2018-12-28 20:21:14 《オリーブ油豆知識》

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
1956 2018-12-28 20:21:12 リプ脱字してたむり はあ
1957 2018-12-28 20:21:04 if you posted this by mistake and didn't understand how fuel/gas/oil pricing works, that's ok. I forgive you.

But if you posted this to deliberately misinform your constituents/others to give yourself a good look, its despicable and you should absolutely be ashamed. Do better.
1958 2018-12-28 20:20:40 Exactly right. When you look at Assange, Amazon, Oil and Gas w Beto etc.. those are all wedges between left and liberals. These are not things we’ve dreamed up because we just don’t happen to like centrists. Chiat represents everything we oppose. Give war a chance, right?
1959 2018-12-28 20:20:37 Project No Heat!! Its hard but worth it. Get a good leave in conditioner or oil, and of course good shampoo and conditioner!
1960 2018-12-28 20:20:34 America wouldn't be so desperate for oil if Donkey Kong hadn't wasted thousands of barrels of it to kill Mario in 1981.
1961 2018-12-28 20:20:29 It is that of the year again. Economic forecasts are available left and right. Clearly, the state faces a precarious situation with a sizable deficit and volatile oil/stock markets. At the same time, there is considerable optimism(some of it justified)

1962 2018-12-28 20:20:29 Either Klopp bottling it or Saudi oil money, take your pic 

Klopp and Poch get enough credit imo, but it's overshadowed by the Pep hate which requires the constant regurgitating of the same lame hypocritical narratives
1963 2018-12-28 20:20:28 I'm all in for traditional broccoli slaw but I guess if you wanted to make it healthy you could omit the bacon and substitute olive oil for mayo.
1964 2018-12-28 20:20:24 YEHA TRY IT!!! you wont regret it unless you hate eggs or oil owo
ive also been informed its good to try with mustard and/or paprika
1965 2018-12-28 20:20:23 Full circle: Let's all advocate for why our candidates have the answers and what those answers are. 
Nit-picking about whether an oil rig operator's $20 contribution is the same as $50K from Exxon/Mobil to a PAC is not good for the party.
1966 2018-12-28 20:20:22 ほう…どうやら叫びたくなるほど素晴らしいネタが浮かんだようだな、OIL=何進　日曜東チ08b…　違うとは言わせんぞ！このオレにその原稿を見せやがれ！！
1967 2018-12-28 20:20:20 Watch me start swearing by using coconut oil for everything yet despising the taste of actual coconut food items
1968 2018-12-28 20:20:15 Its true! We get to support and work for whomever is the big chair, even if they suck while we support and defend, oil and defense and pharma companies around the world.

1975 2018-12-28 20:19:31 So I just called auto zone to see how much an oil drip pan would run me and this dude asks me “for what type of vehicle sir”
1976 2018-12-28 20:19:28 “Ayye bruh what y’all do to my car these deep fryers using up all the oil I got to get an oil change every week now”

1982 2018-12-28 20:19:13 I don’t think we should have our troops anywhere for the sake of oil!
1983 2018-12-28 20:19:04 Yeah was gunna say we use bicarb with lemon oil or something nice. Also works
1984 2018-12-28 20:19:03 & when I say it needed oil badly it was only bloody empty  I’ve literally been too busy to fill my car with oil and the engine almost seized ffs  dick head 
1985 2018-12-28 20:19:02 Except there’s no oil in Central America ...
1986 2018-12-28 20:19:02 If you have to ask, you “totally” don’t get it.
If Tides really cared about people they allegedly help, they would drop their anti-oil campaign, full stop.
There are few entities that support our social net, in a myriad of ways, than Oil & Gas companies.
Tides is foreign sabotage
1987 2018-12-28 20:18:56 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
1988 2018-12-28 20:18:45 Ever done a podcast on generator, air compressor or oil and gas IoT monitoring and control?
1989 2018-12-28 20:18:43 That's fine but those players don't fall from tress. Klefbom is their best Dman and it's not particularly close. He's a legit top pairing guy but that's it. Look at what Chiareeli gave up to get a second pairing guy in Larsson.
1990 2018-12-28 20:18:32 お迎えありがとうございます！ 薄荷油と申します
こちらこそ是非繋がらせて頂きたいです……！
1991 2018-12-28 20:18:26 Could be either, but I'd suspect oil more likely. Perhaps @bardseyben will know better after a few years of ringing Manxies 
1992 2018-12-28 20:18:22 Is anyone sick among you? He should call the elders of the church to pray over him and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise him up. James 5:14-16
1993 2018-12-28 20:18:21 So my car only stopped working today  wouldn’t start tried everything then decided to put more oil in (needed it bad anyway) then decided to try to turn it over one more time but keep the key and press accelerator and boom it started 
1994 2018-12-28 20:18:05 They are bordering nations war is not in either of their interests. The Kurds were given the offer to make peace with Syria and rejected it for oil greed under the umbrella of the US. So they now come crawling to Syria hoping  Assad's tolerance will save their miserable hides,
1995 2018-12-28 20:18:04 Since the end of British industry, imperial measurements and steam trains old people have retreated into a weird nostalgic neverland of a glorious Britain that never existed.

Snake oil merchants like Farage and Johnson are marching the daft fuckers straight off Bournemouth pier
1996 2018-12-28 20:18:01 a/c dont work but the heat does 
little overdue for an oil change.
1997 2018-12-28 20:18:00 Charity still ain’t got no oil  #Greenleaf
1998 2018-12-28 20:17:58 "our nationalist governments, the oil and steel interests, our drug salesmanship, and so forth, with more or less zeal and loyalty, are selling destruction to mankind."
1999 2018-12-28 20:17:55 Oil companies have been diversifying for a long time.
2000 2018-12-28 20:17:50 It is, but it’s once a year, so same $$ less time. I haven’t had a choice on my last 2 cars, but would never go back to shit oil either.
2001 2018-12-28 20:17:50 Came for an oil change and I like the new Honda Accords!
2002 2018-12-28 20:17:44 CBD oil
2003 2018-12-28 20:17:41 I think my alignment/tires are fucked because I been driving like a crack head recently. So I be driving on faith cuz I don’t wanna get it looked at & I need a oil change .
2004 2018-12-28 20:17:31 Speaking as an environmental biologisr and son of an evangelical pastor, those views are all too real for too many of our citizenry.   The comparison with other fundamentalist, “scorched earth” doctrines is fair.  Buy that snake oil, “in the name of Jesus,” or Allah, or whomever.
2005 2018-12-28 20:17:30 Civilization is headed off a cliff if we don’t rapidly stop burning fossil fuels, and the Democratic Party still can’t stop taking donations from oil and gas companies. At this point incremental half measures will be the death of us all. Read the #IPCC report and then resign. 
2006 2018-12-28 20:17:27 They will be communicating more into 2019. More deals in pipeline. Q1 2019. Hopefully Malaysia will be penciled by midyear 2019 than onto indo for the production uplift with KRIS OIL.

2010 2018-12-28 20:17:20 @billmckibben Your book, 'Oil and Honey' was exceptional. As anindividual born in 1998, I found your words and outlook refreshing and inspiring. I appreciate your efforts in maintaining the beauty and health of our world. I hope as time goes on, more people will share your vision
2011 2018-12-28 20:17:19 Those of you  who closed your GTBank over INNOSON vs GTBank issue, how far?

You can add Dangote and Forte Oil to the list of those to boycott.

2013 2018-12-28 20:17:08 Oil trading at $40/barrel sure helped too
2014 2018-12-28 20:17:08 And to the original comment you made: Capitalism is killing the children of flint, Capitalism is killing the coal miners of West Virginia, Capitalism in continuing the ethnic cleansing of Native Peoples. Capitalism has leaked untold thousands of gallons of oil into the Gulf.

2019 2018-12-28 20:16:26 I have made arguments based off scientific facts and alluded to the uncertainties. If you ever actually read the AR reports, not the policymakers section but the actual science you'll understand that they are selling snake oil. But please Occam away.

2023 2018-12-28 20:16:16 Support for the Tides will fade as the public learns that it is used by the US oil industry to reduce competition by land-locking Cdn oil.  Hopefully Tides will question whether it wants to risk support for its other good works.

2027 2018-12-28 20:16:01 #vegan #dinner roasted #veggies - brussels sprouts, sweet potato, onion and garlic brushed with olive oil and tahmari 425F for 30 min sprinkle with sesame seeds #veganrecipes #recipe #whatveganseat #comfortfood
2028 2018-12-28 20:16:00 Ah. Well do feel better. I had some food poisoning the other day and decided to make spaghetti. Found my sauce to have molded in the fridge, so used olive oil, pepper, and salt. Would have added parmesan cheese if I had it. Surprisingly good. And soft on the stomach.
2029 2018-12-28 20:15:57 Agree completely. I think he was good (and better than the GOP) -- but also a benefit to the GOP, so imitating his record of historic increases in oil production would be a fucking disaster for the poorest people over the next decade.
2030 2018-12-28 20:15:52 I think Nurse is getting better and should be kept as a second pairing.  First pairing is the need to work on
2031 2018-12-28 20:15:51 Gas is definitely there but chances of oil is slim, pray they hit oil well.
2032 2018-12-28 20:15:49 I hate getting my oil changed 
2033 2018-12-28 20:15:43 How so?  Plants and trees are sequestered carbon. CO2 released to atmosphere during combustion. Oil is sequestered carbon. CO2 released to atmosphere during combustion.  Both have utility in photosynthesis.
2034 2018-12-28 20:15:22 Got some ‘stress relief’ and ‘sleep’ massage oil today  can’t wait to be sleepy and relieved of all my stress
2035 2018-12-28 20:15:22 I’ll tell that to everyone because it’s the truth. Can’t handle it? Tough shit. NAFTA did a lot for certain industries. Automotive companies were thriving, as were oil companies. Clothing wasn’t impacted at all. How much clothing do you think comes out of Mexico and Canada?
2036 2018-12-28 20:15:15 Nobody is thinking strategically. The Spectator is selling its readers snake oil. The Tories want to do something that will betray voters. This is not good client management. It will end in sackings.
2037 2018-12-28 20:15:09 Six years of higher education under my belt but nothing makes me feel like a moron quite like when I’m asked what kind of oil I want put into my car.
2038 2018-12-28 20:15:02 Just applied some tea tree oil and I’m unbothered 
2039 2018-12-28 20:14:37 No interest in seeing the hack art of a hack.
2040 2018-12-28 20:14:35 Oil stains aren’t cute :/
2041 2018-12-28 20:14:28 @SportsnetSpec taking a run at Chiarelli with Bob...nice to hear.
2042 2018-12-28 20:14:27 Heeft er iemand al coconut oil als body cream gebruikt? Zo ja wat vind je ervan??
2043 2018-12-28 20:14:19 He’s a guardian of his oil patch money
2044 2018-12-28 20:14:11 “Oil? Who’s taking about oil? Bitch, you cooking?” He’s just using a tragedy to deflect and his groupies eat it right up. Crime statistics don’t matter. Shut down doesn’t matter. Amazing.
2045 2018-12-28 20:14:04 Trump cozying up to Putin because Russia wants sanctions lifted. It's all about the oil. I'm concerned about that and it's happening right now.
2046 2018-12-28 20:14:03 The US is failing and it’s @realDonaldTrump’s fault. Don’t be hoodwinked by this snake oil salesman. #LockHimUp #ObstructionOfJustice #TrumpCrimeFamily #Resist
2047 2018-12-28 20:13:59 Not really. People come into the US all the time. As long as they have the proper paperwork, who cares if they’re a foreign dignitary or not? And in a war zone, all bets are off. That said, we shouldn’t be in Iraq. 15 years is long enough. Let big oil pay for their own security.
2048 2018-12-28 20:13:45 All for it! This is a monumental task as oil prices fall & Okla continues to rely on its revenue to fund agencies. K-5 in our district run 22-27 Ss per class. We would need 6 Ts plus all resources 2 accomplish pre-1990 limits. I am sure other districts r similar or higher #oklaed
2049 2018-12-28 20:13:38 Trying to save time & money for your business in the oil industry? #RFID is making traction in the oil industry for valve tracking.
2050 2018-12-28 20:13:34 Red oil
2051 2018-12-28 20:13:29 Oil my board baby
2052 2018-12-28 20:13:25 Depends. The Leafs would have interest in Nurse so might a few other teams out east but the return needs to make sense.
2053 2018-12-28 20:13:21 A nice warm bath with a drop of lavender and tea tree oil  hope u feel better soon 
2054 2018-12-28 20:13:14 Lots of jurisdictions are dependant on oil revenues, but not many of those places nationalized the food industry and put price controls on food that are lower than the cost of producing or importing it. Canadians that supported socialism in Venezeula should be ashamed. #cndpoli

2056 2018-12-28 20:13:02 it never makes me oily and I'm an oil slick. I can powder well enough and after like 8 hours I just start to look glowy. it's so bomb
2057 2018-12-28 20:13:01 I go to the same place EVERYTIME I get my oil changed... I just need my oil changed thats it but these assholes always try to get me to get other shit done. NICE TRY
2058 2018-12-28 20:12:57 The Blackwater Group..let’s ask Cheney, Summers, Woolsey, Flynn, Rumsfeld, Kian, Brennan, Clapper, Rosenstien, Bush, McCabe, Strzok, Baker, can we include the Carlisle Group....how do all these individuals connect..what about Lambert , Levinson, even Khashoggi..Guns/Oil/Drugs
2059 2018-12-28 20:12:56 ごま油。。。くっそ。
2060 2018-12-28 20:12:41 Well there you have it. The cotton balls went brown! We have 50 years of science on the health impacts of tobacco, and how many years on artificially flavoured oil vapour?
2061 2018-12-28 20:12:18 If EU and China “didn’t want the competition for their fiat” they wouldn’t have structured their currencies to be pro-cyclical to gold the way they have.  EUR & CNY both structured to gain ability to be printed for oil/commodity imports.
2062 2018-12-28 20:12:18 Except for the coconut oil, also what my doctor told me...however, I already had a head start. I would use coconut oil more often except for its low smoke point.
2063 2018-12-28 20:12:18 I don't have Lyme disease, I have fibromyalgia and CFS. I use oil of oregano to fight off colds. There is no cure for the neurological disorders I have. Wish you all the best.
2064 2018-12-28 20:12:17 Drink a hot cup of milk use the bathroom before bed get a fan for your room Not for breeze but for the soothing sound watch your fav Netflix series until you fall asleep and if that doesn't work go to a priest and ask for holy oil  and apply to your forehead in cross motion
2065 2018-12-28 20:12:04 Not tried watercolour as such, just the style of painting with heavily watered acrylic. Can get cheap oil to play around with, but yeah, they get damn expensive
2066 2018-12-28 20:11:46 I talked myself out of taking the dip buy on crude oil Nadex spread around 45. Would of been a perfect dip buy. Just struggling to pull the trigger lately
2067 2018-12-28 20:11:46 I would argue, it is not as clear as some think and they no longer have the necessary pieces in house to actually upgrade it. Going sideways along the blueline doesn't improve anything but adding forwards who could actually help their studs upfront is viable.

2069 2018-12-28 20:11:34 Lemme check dat oil it’s not to hard
2070 2018-12-28 20:11:27 Peter Lougheed flew over the tar sands,  and said it was a horrendous environmental disaster.  And he was an oil guy.
2071 2018-12-28 20:11:21 You can also use nice oil to shave once the area is damp enough(like coconut or olive oil). The razor glides over the skin easily and is least likely to cut the skin.
2072 2018-12-28 20:11:18 Put some eucalyptus oil in my epsom salt bath and now my butthole feels very minty 
2073 2018-12-28 20:11:09 For my understanding it’s not tribal. Cos when GEJ he said OK let Lagos be our Industrial hubb and let North go back to their farming and let South East continue with their Intr/Enterprenural gift and let South Incharge of their Oil. At end of the day submits his revenue in ABJ
2074 2018-12-28 20:10:55 @althiaraj Loved final comment on @CBCNATIONAL about politicians being lapse on climate change in the face of scientists sounding the alarms. Very concerning how much apathy there is. Considering the clean economy is in the Trillions! seems oil industry still have their puppets.

2077 2018-12-28 20:10:33 So from the way this sounds
Someone said don't believe overwhelming evidence do some research
Then you proceeded to read conspiracy blogs and opinion pieces of people working for oil companies and then you were convince?
2078 2018-12-28 20:10:10

2083 2018-12-28 20:09:58 Yeah and I use oil base makeup remover on my eyes lol so it’s a no lol
2084 2018-12-28 20:09:44 OMG White Angelica oil is going to be my new perfume, it's so darn yummy! 
2085 2018-12-28 20:09:42 So who do Oilers target?  You seem to have ideas
2086 2018-12-28 20:09:32 We need #GreenNewDeal , we need scientists,  we need members who have committed to no $$$ from Big Oil.  We are out of time to solve this.
2087 2018-12-28 20:09:23 HALF A BOTTLE OF OLIVE OIL

HOW DOES THAT ENTER INTO SOMEONE'S BRAIN TO EVEN DO
2088 2018-12-28 20:09:19 Americans have coconut oil, but us hispanic have AGUA MARAVILLA.
2089 2018-12-28 20:09:17 Good Grief!!!  Can't use our oil etc.  Get a broom to travel on.
2090 2018-12-28 20:09:13 4/ Here's the kicker, though. If the power in an EV battery comes from a power station that burns gas, oil or coal, then that energy is produced with about 40% efficiency of that energy stored in the fuel. The rest goes as waste heat (unless u do something useful with it).
2091 2018-12-28 20:09:12 Sorry, poker term. The best thinkers, most aggressive entrepreneurs, those that are long-term oriented. In a ICO scam environment, low quality snake oil teams run the table. No longer the case.
2092 2018-12-28 20:09:08 Will you give AOC a spot on the committee? Will you ban congress members who take money from big oil? Will you have subpoena power and work towards creating a green new deal? If not, then you’re just wasting your time.
2093 2018-12-28 20:08:52 I mean you can get them wet but not like drenched...and you can’t use an oil based makeup remover because it’ll take of the lashes:/
2094 2018-12-28 20:08:49 I just read something that said, “Be his beard oil!” Lmaoo now that’s something I can get behind! 
2095 2018-12-28 20:08:28 @Audi got an A4 2010 with 33K miles...oil consumption problem and Audi gave me a hard time.  Then catalytic problem...audi didn’t agree it was due to oil problem and no help.  I love u Audi but I will not get another one!
2096 2018-12-28 20:08:24 We wouldn’t want the oil fields we stole to fall under anyone else’s control.
2097 2018-12-28 20:08:18 I like the vitamin e oil lotion in the tub at the dollar store. It’s the only thing I use on my tattoos as well!
2098 2018-12-28 20:07:57 Ticks when ANY electrical current occurs while the car is off, check engine light is on, need an oil change, hub bearing roars on the right side, and somebody just recently hit my car so now the front of my car silver when the actual car is white 
2099 2018-12-28 20:07:57 Ummm, are you going to allow big oil $ recipients on the committee? What is this committees function, other than optics?
2100 2018-12-28 20:07:50 OPEC just like any international organization only benefits its prominent members. With Qatar set to leave next month, OPEC's demise is inevitable.

The sooner Nigeria leaves OPEC, the better; we can begin trading oil bilaterally with other nations by deals that work best for us.
2101 2018-12-28 20:07:32 Chronic Lyme, that's what it's all tied to.
Undiagnosed Lyme and vicious coinfections.
14 yrs and still suffering. You are not alone, no way! God hasn't given up on us, He will show us the way. Use Wild Oregano.
Its a life saver.
P-73 oil and juice, Neuroloft. Goog it.

2102 2018-12-28 20:07:30 They already do, on prevailing winds in our region flowing NW to SE, they're downwind of Essroc. Seriously...not trying to be cute. And Luke (WestVaCo). And several coal-fired power plants. The many thousands of chimneys on homes which are still using heating oil (#2 diesel).
2103 2018-12-28 20:07:30 A dude on Jeopardy last night said he had hiccups for like a week until he drank half a bottle of olive oil. I don’t know if that would work in this case but you could try.
2104 2018-12-28 20:07:15 Let’s get angry at the oil barrens, Bankers and rich elites who want the poor to pay for their new enterprise. They can foot the bill
2105 2018-12-28 20:07:04 The weakness on this team is clearly defence and you want to trade a top 4 young d man for a winger
2106 2018-12-28 20:06:47 Sorry, we don’t accept this. Find someone who isn’t bought by big oil.
2107 2018-12-28 20:06:30 .@Ocasio Praises #FloridaRepKathyCastor for vowing not to take campaign $$ from fossil fuel companies when there isn’t a single oil well in her district and not a coal mine in the entire state. Ocasio giving credit where none is due  .@seanhannity
2108 2018-12-28 20:06:29 Can we just take a moment to discuss how diverse and amazing oil lamps are
2109 2018-12-28 20:06:28 cooked these fries in 3 quarts of motor oil and ain’t give me no napkins now my steering wheel look like Plump Rumps vol 44.
2110 2018-12-28 20:06:21 I know one thing for sure, I am definitely not car savvy. In no way, shape, or form do I know anything about cars besides maintaining oil, needing gas to travel and keeping it clean. Modifications on cars, types, etc.., gtfo I have no idea don’t ask me lol
2111 2018-12-28 20:06:16 in need of tea tree oil like now 
2112 2018-12-28 20:06:15 I’m at bunny house  let me take care of the after Christmas stress! Hot oil massage available!
2113 2018-12-28 20:06:13 Off Topic, Question, if cars NOW, can charge a battery (generator) why can't the same thing be done with Electric Cars?
Car Companies are capable of so much more but only do (things) when pressured! Electric Cars were possible yrs ago but Oil magnates didn't want that!
2114 2018-12-28 20:06:11 #askthecolourman again: I just wondering why except titanium White is in safflower oil, other oil paints include blue colours are all ground in linseed oils? @mhoilpaints
2115 2018-12-28 20:06:10 Basotho are bad drivers. Also, cars are bad for the environment  AND walking, cycling, are a healthier alternative. Also, imagine our country not having to import oil 

Maybe Basotho will be motivated to find alternative means of energy..you know, like water....
2116 2018-12-28 20:06:05 Generally,,oil stocks are very cheap.. potential for take overs and mergers, if assumption crude oil prices destined climb higher long term above $75
2117 2018-12-28 20:05:59 And when it is our oil which is a main source of economic growth in Canada. Do you think that benefits Canada and Canadians as a whole?
2118 2018-12-28 20:05:58 Thanks and it's not that hard... you just gotta make sure that you apply it to ends first or you'll have super light roots and darker ends cause of some weird science thing. Also don't apply on dry hair and coconut oil is a good moisturiser
2119 2018-12-28 20:05:58 How can someone like me an average American with a dream become successful...I print t shirts and hoodies but still margins are small...I bought an 18wheeler and haul crude oil but didn't have working capital to keep my truck on the road...I need help...how do we become successfu
2120 2018-12-28 20:05:55 have a feeling that crying as soon as i get into bed defeats the point of covering my face in expensive oil
2121 2018-12-28 20:05:52 Look, I think it's sad for Albertans, but the quicker they diversify their economy away from oilsands, the better. Spending big money on pipelines to ship oil that sells below production cost is lunacy.
2122 2018-12-28 20:05:52 Jus put some peppermint oil on my scalp it feels amazing!
2123 2018-12-28 20:05:51 420, coconut oil and steer clear of pharma poison.
2124 2018-12-28 20:05:50 He ran in Texas.  The largest industry in the State is the Oil Industry.  Who do you expect his donors to be tea baggers
2125 2018-12-28 20:05:42 Again you are wrong! 
Onne Port handles international and Local cargo / containers.

It was initially designated for Oil & Gas handling meaning it will cater primarily for cargoes / containers for the oil industry. This has been changed and it is now a general purpose Port.
2126 2018-12-28 20:05:30 Yes that was certainly the story from the Walsall end. I’m not sure the oil barrels on the pitch were ever really going to do the trick though
2127 2018-12-28 20:05:01 Thank you pres trump for allowing our Oil companies to drill their way to lower fuel cost. My wallet and 12.5 MPG appreciate it. Remember tho $1.00 roughly per gal is taxes. Theres another way to lower it 
2128 2018-12-28 20:04:57 ...of "left wing" policies like obamacare (which had huge input and subsequent payoffs from and for insurance companies) or environmentalism (even though Obama increased oil exports while paying lip service to environmentalists) 

History shmistory, tho, amiright
2129 2018-12-28 20:04:47 Would be good to see them crippled. But, maybe they have their own centrist dems take up the energy wars in place of the KGB douchecanoes - scary thought kinda - we'd still have the BRICS prob further south.

The globe just needs a better way than oil/gas based fiat hegemony.
2130 2018-12-28 20:04:43 Lavender and eucalyptus is one of my fave oil combos 
2131 2018-12-28 20:04:41 For my smoking community ... can you take the oil from a Vape cartridge and put it on a dab rig 
2132 2018-12-28 20:04:38 So far CBD oil has been the best antidepressant I’ve tried. Gives me the relaxed feeling weed should give me without thinking aliens might be running the government
2133 2018-12-28 20:04:35 Your @nntaleb prize is a badge of honour! To you it's a good-natured betting game, to me it's an annual opportunity to draw attention to the fact that oil analysts are charlatans. None of them foresaw the big price moves of the past, none of them has shown forecasting 'skill'.
2134 2018-12-28 20:04:35 Russia ,turkey have no stake in legitimate peace process,turkey just wants kurds ambition limited,Russia wants oil fiels in eastern syria,so that they don't have to subsidize assad for long.
2135 2018-12-28 20:04:27 You literally just stated you accept the problem just not on the scale of how it will eventually turn out.
You quote oil company shills while at the same time demonizing real science.
2136 2018-12-28 20:04:24 That probably is a yummy marinade...
I'm gonna use olive oil, salt & pepper.

The chuck eye is very reasonable... $7/lb
2137 2018-12-28 20:04:21 "Let the [insert profession] decide how to [address the public policy issue]..."

Sounds like a Lobbyist. Might not have the publics best interest in mind:
• Big Oil
• Big Pharma
• Big Tobacco
2138 2018-12-28 20:04:12 I wish I knew a kid when I went to school who would try to sell “healing” oils to the other kids. That way when they eventually gets their ass beat I can see first hand if that peppermint oil works first hand. 

“Oh did you say Billy isn’t in today either?...Interesting”
2139 2018-12-28 20:04:11 Neither. Don’t classify emissions. Classify production. Are the biggest refineries in Texas? Do the longest pipelines come from Canada? Does California have the most oil rigs? Does Delaware license the most oil companies?
2140 2018-12-28 20:04:11 Yep. And candidates who vote with Republicans and pretend they don't accept funds from big oil when they do in the form of bundling. And politicians who support Pharma and the insurance lobby by not supporting what the people want which is M4A.
2141 2018-12-28 20:04:00 True but it there something even worse, palm oil?
2142 2018-12-28 20:03:56 I take boiling showers so I can simulate the feeling of being oil inside of a car engine.
2143 2018-12-28 20:03:52 Not the danger of slippery floors when these fluids pour? Lol appaz you're not even in parent mode yet. There are things you can't 100% protect against. Oil bottles that should be in your kitchen cabinet and out of reach aren't one.
2144 2018-12-28 20:03:46 There are some other products I'd give a shot though. 

My Fluffy Puffs Moisturizer
Diva Products Moisture Cream
HD Waves Moisturaid

And then of them I'd pick their oil to combine with it as a moisture sealant.
2145 2018-12-28 20:03:45 Ultimate dips 

1)fish sauce 
2) balsmic vinaigrette 
3) Chili fried garlic oil
2146 2018-12-28 20:03:44 Extensions out and hair slapped to my head with an oil treatment on. I now identify as a boiled potato.

2149 2018-12-28 20:03:38 I just went and looked, out of curiosity, and he got $250 from oil and gas in 2016. Not $250k.  $250.  In 2014, he got a bunch, but still only his 5th biggest sector, even though it's the number 1 district industry donor.

So, kinda punches holes in any consistent narrative.
2150 2018-12-28 20:03:32 It was not overblown.  Oil Change USA took him off of their no fossil fuel pledge.  That pledge included both PAC "and" individual oil/fossil fuel donors.  Maybe you just don't hold politicians to the high standards they should/need to be held to....
2151 2018-12-28 20:03:30 Netflix -> Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj -> Episode titled "Oil". — watching Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj
2152 2018-12-28 20:03:21 Ooh already answered. Put em all in an applicator bottle. Rosemary oil helps, too
2153 2018-12-28 20:03:19 Canada is the leader in environmental made oil. The places that we import oil from are the worst. Try getting our our oil to other markets is how you create change. Letting the world buy including Canada some of the worlds worst environmental &ethical made oil is a change needed
2154 2018-12-28 20:03:15 So we can agree that axing the carbon tax and cap & trade, lower global oil prices and winter blend all lowered the price at the pump in Ontario.

That's a good start.
2155 2018-12-28 20:03:14 Why do you think he voted to allow US oil exports for the first time in decades during a period where climate scientists have unequivocally told us we must "keep it in the ground?"

And does that show sound judgement?
2156 2018-12-28 20:03:12 Agreed. But I die a little inside every time I see Mcdavid button hook in the neutral zone and ready to fly up ice with the puck but Nurse can’t make the 15 foot diagonal pass!  Or many of the D for that matter
2157 2018-12-28 20:03:04 Gas guzzler? Start tightening your oil buckets sir.
2158 2018-12-28 20:02:54 Bruh ugh Can this stupid car not have a regular oil change ?
2159 2018-12-28 20:02:53 Doc pasó el año corto en dólar y apalancado, creo que enero va a ser bueno para la bolsa, el oil y el peso. Saludos
2160 2018-12-28 20:02:43 Dirty oil a big part of the air pollution problems in China. Alberta should stop selling it.
2161 2018-12-28 20:02:42 If you are into essential oils just be careful if you have pets because some types of oils are toxic to animals. Just a friendly reminder for all my oil diffusers out there.
2162 2018-12-28 20:02:31 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*

2170 2018-12-28 20:01:51 Y'all, I started using a face oil in my routine and my skin feels so good. I've tried in past to incorporate one, but it would just sit on top of my skin and look greasy. I love it.

2178 2018-12-28 20:01:03 Palm kernel oil in the Vega bars is a stabilizer and helps with the texture. In pursuit of constant improvement, we’re working on identifying other ingredients that could replace palm kernel oil and we’ll let you know if we discover the next it ingredient.
2179 2018-12-28 20:00:59 FT russophobe paper economy is far from perfect but they structured it around oil at $40 so they are doing well not badly
2180 2018-12-28 20:00:53 You have great gas prices because oil prices are down as world economies slows.
2181 2018-12-28 20:00:49 STOLEN, LOOTED, STILL CHEAPER THAN NICKING BILLION$ OF OIL MONEY.
2182 2018-12-28 20:00:46 Your LoTR series was truly excellent.  The struggle between New Zealanders and the film studios over workers rights (and even national sovereignty) in the face of corporate power was revelatory.  Especially hits home for me, living in a jurisdiction dominated by the oil industry.

2188 2018-12-28 20:00:36 Thanks for reaching out! Promoting sustainability is important to you and it’s important to us at Vega. At Vega, we source Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certified sustainable palm kernel oil in our bars.
2189 2018-12-28 20:00:30 Especially is by learning the horrors of war and preventing it includes MIC climate destruction, "collateral damage" as being intentional murder, blood for oil, etc...I will support, I am not holding my breath either though.

2192 2018-12-28 20:00:26 So, how can we reconcile “credibility” on the climate change file—judged by environmental absolutists—with support for Alberta oil patch workers??? Maybe we accept half a loaf on GHG reductions & slow, incremental change. #cdnpoli #ableg
2193 2018-12-28 20:00:26  I have a ton of salt and ground pepper, some olive oil, garlic, and thyme. Hoping for medium rare! I’ll sear it briefly after. I’ll show you all the finished product!!!

2196 2018-12-28 20:00:08 Another very questionable comment from someone who hasn’t checked the price of crude oil lately. It’s got nothing to do with cap and trade.
2197 2018-12-28 20:00:06 & There it is.. bitter kunts can’t help themselves... the bonus of our success is what every blues knows ... it’s cutting them up big time.. oil kunts .. luv this fook’in game. 
2198 2018-12-28 20:00:04 Lets see.  I work, sleep, went for a jog, change engine oil and pump full tank.  Its a good friday.
2199 2018-12-28 19:59:51 Libby is so annoying. Throwing oil in the fire for no reason.
2200 2018-12-28 19:59:41 Yeah eg nobody using palm oil is forcing Indonesia to support deforestation & it's debatable what effect reduced demand alone would have. But look at historical production, too. Rich countries should pay poor ones to change (super likely I know).
2201 2018-12-28 19:59:24 Now you giving me second thoughts.. meen tryna pull my anointing oil to watch that show 
2202 2018-12-28 19:59:09 everyone can predict the future
for example i predict that there will be a giant oil spill on march 15, 2019
will my prediction be correct
probably not 
but i still predicted the future
2203 2018-12-28 19:59:02 I’ve been taking an antibiotic called Doxycycline for 6 months and washing my face with the Sunlight Green Bar. I use the Eucerine Oil Control sunscreen to moisturize.
2204 2018-12-28 19:59:00 We are the 2nd largest NET contributor to the EU budget. Your point is hogwash. As for the agricultural point, the EU tell farmers what to grow, sometimes to the detriment of themselves or the land they use (Rapeseed oil case a few years back)

2208 2018-12-28 19:58:43 Sprinkle a little salt in your pan if you're frying. This will prevent the oil from splattering.
2209 2018-12-28 19:58:31 Noooo... that doesn't usually happen... usually IT IS MY CAR. Once I thought I was dripping oil all the way up the road though... and then realized it WAS someone else. that was nice... :)
2210 2018-12-28 19:58:17 All I'm trying to say is, it is very easy to be overwhelmed minding a child. The world doesn't halt for you because you have one. And apart from the risk of ruining your furniture, there's no palpable reason why you would think to keep your palm oil out of reach.
2211 2018-12-28 19:58:09 Okay Shea Moistures red palm oil line is that girl though tbh
2212 2018-12-28 19:58:01 How do you clean your EO diffuser? I let my old one get so much build up it didn’t even smell like the oils I was using anymore. Just a simple cleaning??? I’ve only used it twice but I can already feel the oil all over it

2218 2018-12-28 19:57:31 You can only reach the conclusion that big dollar contributions from oil & gas company execs “don’t matter” if you stop short of analyzing the fact that O’Rourke’s big dollar contributions are entirely aligned with his 6 year record of voting in the interests of those donors.

2221 2018-12-28 19:57:17 It’s super basic just Cetaphil & Vitamin E oil for moisturizer. Other than that a visit to the dermatologist saved my life lol
2222 2018-12-28 19:57:16 Any suggestions for something to clean your tummy, except caster oil, that doesn't last the whole day
2223 2018-12-28 19:57:12 Okay, how much energy that uses oil is required for bottle production? I can't imagine it would be that much.
2224 2018-12-28 19:57:10 I get hit on every time I go get an oil change without fail
2225 2018-12-28 19:57:00 With due respect to Adam, he's not a defenceman, For me, the biggest issue I have with Nurse is how much running around he does in his own end. He puts himself and his partner in a tough spot with far too great a regularity.

2227 2018-12-28 19:56:40 The original jibe was not aimed at you but a wrong has to be righted. It’s the value of oil. End of story.
2228 2018-12-28 19:56:26 Really disappointed to hear via @TheYoungTurks that you take money from oil and gas executives. Also, why a complete 180 on #MedicareForAll?
2229 2018-12-28 19:56:25 Coconut oil mixing it with cocoa butter lotion after you shave with shaving cream works for me
2230 2018-12-28 19:56:21 Yes, most successful in history/resources committed. 2000 soldiers (3 dead) for controlling 1/3 of Syria and almost all major oil fields, electrical production, agricultural lands etc. US had a strong position in future negotiations which would take place in the coming year.
2231 2018-12-28 19:56:20 Funny enough the answer is pretty much the same as what people say for Beto. Vermont has a $2B aerospace industry and is located between major hubs in CT and Montreal. Plus Bernie has never expressed particular pro-defense views which can’t be said for Beto and oil.
2232 2018-12-28 19:56:05 I need money to buy my grandma 1 bag of rice and oil for new year since I didnt buy for Christmas. Her prayers keeps me o
2233 2018-12-28 19:56:00 Oil prices never hit $100 per barrel until 2000 something. It peaked around $35 in 1980.   It dropped under $10 per barrel in mid 80’s. In today’s dollars however it would have been over $100 per barrel in 1980.

2238 2018-12-28 19:55:30 Yes girl! I’m on this protective style movement and I’ve been using it and it is the bomb. You can never go wrong with your mixed oils like a mixture of Jajoba oil, olive oil, coconut oil, black castor oil, etc
2239 2018-12-28 19:55:29 
2240 2018-12-28 19:55:16 Beto has NOT taken “oil and gas money.”  He HAS taken money from individual donors who work in the oil and gas industry.

2254 2018-12-28 19:53:56 Until ppb <$15, then no one gets any oil.
2255 2018-12-28 19:53:55 Shehu Shagari. He would have presided over an early oil revenue boom due to sharp rise in oil prices. Oil prices rose from $15 in mid-1979 to $38 in 1981. 

However, Nigeria's oil production which slumped in late 1970s due to nationalization policy of previous govt, eroded gains.
2256 2018-12-28 19:53:42 You are plainly thick. I’m playing devils advocate with you (look it up). The commonly used but erroneous term is “price of a barrel of oil” the correct term is “value of a barrel of oil”. Comprende?

2261 2018-12-28 19:53:18 its where you put something in a pan and cook it with a little oil/fat/butter. When you cook bacon in a pan the natural fats create a nice grease to cook the onions in too...or anything else you want lol.

2274 2018-12-28 19:51:28 ffs, the oil prices (which was a global drop we won't pin on Harper anyhow) happened while conservatives were running the show. Why didn't *your* team roll out a second pile of boutique tax credits or whatever your tactic du jour was, for your base back then?

2277 2018-12-28 19:51:22 Yes but does it work?!?

“Snake oil?! What’s that? Does it work?!”
2278 2018-12-28 19:51:21 The price of oil has cratered, leaving your boy Jay Kenney sputtering. That's why prices are down, not the removal of a fixed rate tax. FFS.

2292 2018-12-28 19:50:02 I normaly farm the normal difficulties due to them having the 3x Multiplier every day for the first clear, have a better oil to PT ratio (my opinion atleast) and are better to autofleet
I spend about 6k oil per eventday and on day one i spend allmost 20k
2293 2018-12-28 19:50:00 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
2294 2018-12-28 19:49:56 MCT oil contains C6-C12 fatty acids, whereas the fatty acids that gut bacteria make to fortify the gut barrier are primarily C2-C5.
2295 2018-12-28 19:49:54 I really enjoyed painting it.....often difficult to get oil colours just right as can end up 'muddy' if mixed wrong,  but think I have got the hang of it now....hopefully!
2296 2018-12-28 19:49:53 Yup. The Trump presidency has (so far) been light on major news (ie stable). Consider recent pre-2106 history:

-Vietnam War
-JFK/MLK/RFK Assassinations
-Watergate
-Oil Crises
-Collapse of USSR
-Gulf War
-9/11
-Iraq War
-Great Recession
-Arab Spring
-Ukraine

2297 2018-12-28 19:49:45 Sure they do and they have said veterans on this team, Just b/c a guy is a veteran, that doesn't mean they can take on a role they're ill-equipped for. One would think this organization would learn from that mistake...as they have made it on multiple occasions.
2298 2018-12-28 19:49:44 Lest we forget that previous Alberta progressive conservative governments have transformed a trillion dollar largesse from our Alberta oil into a prov. debt of more than 40 billion$.
2299 2018-12-28 19:49:43 Thanks to the oil companies and some intrepid billionaires, the climate scientists have been exposed! #snark
2300 2018-12-28 19:49:26 Yeah. Married to a millionaire heiress. Taking dirty oil money / voting accordingly when climate scientists tell us we’ve got 12 years to get our shit right. Faux Latino nickname bullshit. Can’t even beat one of the most despised republicans in the country. What inspires faith?
2301 2018-12-28 19:49:14 LOL! My tweet was incomprehensible anyway!  And I’m a linguist!   But thanks for clarifying. My ketones are generally in the neighborhood of 1.1 to 1.5 unless I have MCT oil. I don’t know how people get in the 3-4 range, but I don’t have epilepsy so that’s fine for me.

2306 2018-12-28 19:49:03 It doesn't even have to be microchips.

Something like oil filters - necessary, no longer manufactured in this country - an embargo on a single widget required for infrastructure could cripple the economy, timescale may vary.

2308 2018-12-28 19:49:01 that's the life of an engineer. Engine oil should be like ice cream to you too
2309 2018-12-28 19:48:48 Global economic slowdown concerns have been influencing on stock market movements. Importantly oil prices cannot be considered irrelevant from those concerns. #brent #WTI
2310 2018-12-28 19:48:48 I made an omelette that was 90% oil and cheese, chased it with preworkout, and now my heart and stomach are racing to see who can kill me first
2311 2018-12-28 19:48:46 I can feel your pain and I know its not Hugo Chavez who is messing your country. Its the Americans. They want to steal your oil. Nway, you can block me if you like its not like I care.
2312 2018-12-28 19:48:45 I won’t check your phone,but I’ll check your oil,washer fluid,transmission fluid,brakes,tire pressure and gas gauge..I got you
2313 2018-12-28 19:48:41 Literally bought the tea tree night mask and oil today becus you rave about it in videos! Can’t wait to try it!Xx
2314 2018-12-28 19:48:39 Not so sure.  He has Adam Oates for a skills coach and that’s not helping.  If u can’t pass u can’t pass.  Very hard to teach poise.  I wonder if u could do him for Kapanen? Toronto is gonna be strapped next yr and he’s RFA
2315 2018-12-28 19:48:31 Cause deep conditioning puts the moisture back in the hair cause our hair is dry asf, especially without putting oil in it every night or every other night
2316 2018-12-28 19:48:27 Coconut oil always dried my hair out, I gave it up after only a year of being natural lbs
2317 2018-12-28 19:48:19 Bread was $0.25 a loaf and gas was about the same. Then the Arab oil embargo hit, gas zoomed up to $1.25/gallon (when you could get it) and we were all horrified.

2323 2018-12-28 19:48:12 You tell mfs to give you an oil change, they come back with every problem and history on your car& be ready to fix it Right Neow and tax that shit. Mf do what I asked you to do 
2324 2018-12-28 19:48:11 Later today I will be lighting a 55 gallon drum of oil on the front yard and throw in some Brazilian rain forest hardwoods for good measure.
2325 2018-12-28 19:48:10 U.S. oil scores a 1.6% daily gain but logs weekly drop in choppy holiday trade
2326 2018-12-28 19:48:07 It is if you are a Nat... Even get oil in igneous basin such as Clyde...
Only thing is igneous rocks don't hold hydrocarbons.. Strange that.
2327 2018-12-28 19:48:02 Night terrors are the worst. Sorry you are suffering from them. I have cbd oil, a sunset lamp and audible which helps me cope somewhat. Honestly the best thing was having some time off. I hope they get better for you xx

2330 2018-12-28 19:47:50 I’m getting my oil changed and there is actually a child on a leash in the waiting area wow
2331 2018-12-28 19:47:47 He's running out of *Causes* that can offset his excessive applications of olive oil.
2332 2018-12-28 19:47:38  seriously , what a statement after your white paper .
Oil now at $50 a barrel
2333 2018-12-28 19:47:37 Truck clean oil change done 
2334 2018-12-28 19:47:32 They are the future. Sun shines for a few billions years. Oil is gone within a 100 years.And if we burn all that oil, CO2 levels will be very high meaning greenhouse runaway effects. When all the glaciers melt, sea levels could rise 60 metres. So the transition must be made fast.
2335 2018-12-28 19:47:21 and cheap oil

2351 2018-12-28 19:46:05 ‘We’ are not better than this. ‘We’ are a nation of small-minded xenophobes, dumb sheep who want what ‘we’ were promised by charlatans and snake oil salesmen. No one, it seems, can save us from ourselves.
2352 2018-12-28 19:46:02 Please do. I actually need an oil change and my dealership is right by there so I might head out in a bit. Thanks!
2353 2018-12-28 19:45:58 Have you tried an oil based remover? Those tend to be way more gentle
2354 2018-12-28 19:45:56 when ur not around american people4a really long time, like several yrs, and then suddenly ure around them again,you realize that they smell like straight up buffaloes lol Like straight up cattle.

2356 2018-12-28 19:45:41 I do not believe the Bush family has anything to do with firearms today.
It’s oil currently. Oil will start dying out very soon too. Free Energy is coming via #NikolaTesla Technology. A Tesla tower has already been erected in Northern Texas. Don’t buy solar & don’t buy CO2 tax.
2357 2018-12-28 19:45:38 How is pointing out one’s voting record and their backtracking on promises to not accept oil/gas money an attack? Only those loyal to opposing Sanders’ ideas at all cost see telling the truth about another candidate an attack. It’s in their monetary interest to do so.
2358 2018-12-28 19:45:32 it's always about the oil, isn't it? honesty not sure what U.S can really do; Putin already has ships and bombers on patrol there now. apparently Russia has a airbase there too and many speculate that will be targeted. should that happen, have no clue where is might be headed
2359 2018-12-28 19:45:31 Nigeria is one of the countries with the cheapest cost of PMS even amongst nations with bigger oil Reserves and production capacity. Nigerians have a huge sense of entitlement from cheap schools, to cheap hospitals, cheap taxes yet they want the country to be developed. How?

2369 2018-12-28 19:44:47 I don’t disagree at all, in fact that’s exactly what I just said to Rob. I was strictly saying “he’ll be activated in a couple weeks so he should be on your list”. No qualitative comment whatsoever.

2372 2018-12-28 19:44:42 I am afraid it’s me- after my eat this, eat now, get up early, sleep early, oil your hair, wear this etc etc one kid is glad they will be gone in a few days and the other in a few months
2373 2018-12-28 19:44:39 100%
2374 2018-12-28 19:44:34 Mostly bullshit. 4 cents maybe because the CT was removed.  The rest, global oil prices and comsumer demand.  In the end, more GHGs.
2375 2018-12-28 19:44:28 An "oil tank" is not on fire. A truck is clearly on fire. The cab is burning, not the oil tank.
2376 2018-12-28 19:44:25 Weed, oil, and weed oil

Is oil being used up? Yes

Therefore oil is running out.

2384 2018-12-28 19:43:30 For dry skin, use a mixture of baby oil and epsom salt. Rub into skin then shower.
2385 2018-12-28 19:43:25 There are lies, damned lies, PR (and Trump). This is just PR for the oil companies to put profits over life.
2386 2018-12-28 19:43:18 I know how to do all basic stuff. Like tires, checking oil... I had a tire blow recently and got out to change it myself but accepted help when a man offered because it would have taken me longer and I would have been late to work

2388 2018-12-28 19:43:04 Lots of turmoil.

As a budget-conscious citizen just the savings of fuel bills: electric, gasoline, gas, oil, etc. from day-to-day operations should result in substantial savings that could be diverted to building the Wall.

2392 2018-12-28 19:43:01 You’re right they can’t.  I do think Nurse woulda returned more two years ago when he was looked at with all his upside.  We’re now 230 games into his career and it’s becoming apparent that he is what he is
2393 2018-12-28 19:42:52 Not "the American people" but the people you condescend to, who think your recycled socialist fantasies are plausible.  You don't get to speak for me or any of the rest of the "American people" who know snake oil and didn't vote for it.

maybe i should stop wearing beanies and look like a grown up?

2397 2018-12-28 19:42:45 How about the auto assembly industry?  Oil workers are not unskilled, and it can be extremely dangerous and under harsh weather.  It pays that well for a reason, and not because a union has repeatedly negotiated pay raises.
2398 2018-12-28 19:42:42 It’s currently trading at approx $50 a barrel. The higher that price the more money oil companies make, some of which is then collected in taxes to pay for things like the nhs and education, which you obviously missed out on. You should ask for your money back.
2399 2018-12-28 19:42:33 Societe Generale'nin economic equivalent oil prices (EEOP) çalışması dikkat çeken sonuçları da beraberinde getiriyor. Petrol fiyatı, ülkenin fiyat endeksi, para biriminin USD karşısındaki değişimi ve GDP'si için gerekli petrol miktarı hesaplamada yer alıyor. #brent
2400 2018-12-28 19:42:25 My reply to Mr McConnachie who clearly has no understanding of linguistics and correlation to value/cost of oil. Perhaps I’m being a pedant but you KNOW I’m correct!
2401 2018-12-28 19:42:24 I was alive in the '70s, but I did it right and can't remember much.

2405 2018-12-28 19:42:14 This makes me want to go to an @NAPARacing store and get supplies to do an oil change with @Mobil1.     (then dirt jump a Tacoma with my aunt and fall on the ice while skating...)

2407 2018-12-28 19:41:51 I did not know half of industrial emissions are directly tied to oil consumption. Wow.
2408 2018-12-28 19:41:47 Never good when you pull-up for an oil change and they open your hood and a guy busts out laughing and calls the whole inside office out to come look. Then professionally tells me that I have mild wear and tear and should think about getting my car looked at.

2410 2018-12-28 19:41:33 Claiming that employees of has and oil companies = donations by the industry? Ridiculous.
2411 2018-12-28 19:41:32 Bravo, something Beto is against, the wall, there must be some financial gain for Beto or his family, just asking for a friend.  He's not for Medicare for All, supported by big oil, what about the wall doesn't he like? There has to be something.
2412 2018-12-28 19:41:27 Nice
2413 2018-12-28 19:41:16 That’s for actual flower, oil is considered a control substance .
2414 2018-12-28 19:41:13 Yeah, no I doubt it, but keep buying the snake oil.
2415 2018-12-28 19:41:10 Poisons and other harmful stuff are usually out of the way. That's obviously palm oil in a bottle, absolutely no reason to put that away. With my nephew, it was body lotion. It was everywhere. Still gives my nightmares.
2416 2018-12-28 19:41:05 Oil is one of the most destabilizing forces in the west, I agree. Like how Standard Oil almost single handedly sent us into the great depression. It's why it was broken up into several companies. I don't disagree that oil is highly political.
2417 2018-12-28 19:41:02 I have a Stubben with upgraded soft and sticky leather and often wear full seat with the silicone and haven't had any issues. I also oil my saddle regularly, I've heard that helps.
2418 2018-12-28 19:41:02 We’re legit burning through oil like a NFL rookie’s salary.
2419 2018-12-28 19:40:54 I was referring to seed oils, often known as vegetable oils, although they have zero to do with vegetables. Sunflower oil, safflower oil, canola oil, rapeseed oil, palm oil, cotton seed oil, etc. These must be industrially processed to extract the oil, causing molecular damage
2420 2018-12-28 19:40:48 Oh this has to be good with all the oil
2421 2018-12-28 19:40:44 There's no fiber in any oil! Fiber is what our gut bacteria use to make short chain fatty acids, which improve gut barrier function. Better gut barrier function = less microbial products in the blood, which should reduce the amount of microbes that can enter the brain.
2422 2018-12-28 19:40:39 I forgot about Sekera and he will defintely still be in the mix next year as well. i just don't see them getting a good enough forward without making a trade. I know some want them to make another deal to try and improve the backend but they can't afford to give up pieces upfront
2423 2018-12-28 19:40:32 A bit like you don’t understand the difference between the price of a bbl of oil and the cost of a bbl of oil?
2424 2018-12-28 19:40:28 His experience should be valuable no?  Can’t he mentor the young core of dmen?

2426 2018-12-28 19:40:23 In 1980, The government terminates fishing agreements with the U.S. This was due to a decision to use a portion of oil revenues to develop Mexico's own fishing fleet and industry.

2430 2018-12-28 19:39:56 The dealership was too crowded gave me anxiety I’ll just pay for an oil change
2431 2018-12-28 19:39:52 3rd straight weekly loss for oil. Good thing the Fed raised rates in the face of declining prices.
2432 2018-12-28 19:39:51 when i give massages i gotta get the hot oil & light some candles & shit lol
2433 2018-12-28 19:39:24 I give Shavelle honey!  I think Xay should be old enough to eat it! 
Then I always rub baby oil or coconut oil all over her body & under her feet! 
Also have her sleep on an elevated pillow, it helps with the nasal drip part!!
2434 2018-12-28 19:39:19 A full synthetic oil change is ridiculously expensive
2435 2018-12-28 19:39:18 How many burning dead provinces do we let the CPC leave in their aftermath. Alberta was on life support until the NDP.  SASK is a dead corpse of OIL activity and Ontario is GONG SHOW  Canadians have to admit now that the #CPC have No Game no matter who is in charge #cdnpoli

2438 2018-12-28 19:38:53 Move over Kramer oil painting. Sleepy Geno is the new darling with all the critics!
2439 2018-12-28 19:38:49 I would use a stick of butter or about 1/2-3/4 of a cup of oil for an eighth.
2440 2018-12-28 19:38:48 Why is there four guys working on my oil change? Mmmmm

2445 2018-12-28 19:38:02 Then why are you buying / building pipelines and subsidizing the outdated oil industry.
2446 2018-12-28 19:37:58 Can we just get to the “Chias replacement” ASAP and then we can worry about what he does....  please!!
2447 2018-12-28 19:37:50 Oh dear, they've overlooked the ongoing genocide of Armenia by Bolshecik Google and Mongol-turk invaders and their new pawn-Azerbajian -not even as old as the Coke Cola co! Their counterparts 100 years ago took Armenia's oil of Baku -now used to buy world opinion. God repays! Eh?
2448 2018-12-28 19:37:46 It's not it's straight up copying. You can't oil paint the Mona Lisa and claim to have only used it as a reference, you copied it. The same applies here since there is no transformative qualities to the piece at all.
2449 2018-12-28 19:37:45 He absolutely tolerates it.  You're wrong and buying his snake oil.
2450 2018-12-28 19:37:45 Would love an ILTB on unconventional oil/gas and its various market impacts. Not sure how broadly that interest is shared though. I may be only listener to that episode.
2451 2018-12-28 19:37:33 Pretty big stretch to assume a guy on the wrong side of 30 coming back from an achilles and an ACL has even a chance to come back to his prior level.
2452 2018-12-28 19:37:22 Is this one of those “the oil light doesn’t get brighter” kind of debates?
2453 2018-12-28 19:37:18 Energy East was killed by Trudeau’s changing the rules for approval part way through,Plus his Quebec mafia objected to the line. How do you measure the effects the oil in the pipeline would have before and after it’s in the line?Straight up obstructionism by the Trudope liberals
2454 2018-12-28 19:37:13 Muslims have oil, and live in absolute poverty and slavery. Jews have nothing, and live in absolute prosperity and freedom. THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JEWS AND MUSLIMS...
2455 2018-12-28 19:37:13 Have u tried the bio oil babe?? Supposedly that helps!! Xx
2456 2018-12-28 19:37:11 I say no if you're Chiarelli you try to spend the rest of season trying to find a way to unload $$$ then draft well and go after a big FA like Stone that's our only hope
2457 2018-12-28 19:36:56 The car needs a realignment, oil change, and new tires that are not from the shanty town in nasty city. The under carriage is exposed and the bumper one good ditch from falling off. The back bumper scratched up, the carpet comin up, the seats need a detailing
2458 2018-12-28 19:36:44 Nurse coulda got them Trouba two years ago man! Now I’m not sure what his value is.  Also we can cross our fingers on Sekera having something left
2459 2018-12-28 19:36:41 I live right between the two Larry green auto dealerships. For the last 5 years I’ve seen the workers driving the new cars hard back and forth between them. And I mean hard hard. I’m talking cold engine, high RPM, no way the oil is lubricating hard.
2460 2018-12-28 19:36:40 It seems castor oil overnight is the way to go! I got almost all of the remaining lashes off without pulling mine out... There are still three hanging on tight lol so I'm doing a lil more oil while I clean the house. Castor oil is really good for your hair and lashes anyway btw!
2461 2018-12-28 19:36:33 Oil and gas rigs up 150 y/y ... quick, someone tell the pipelines not to file BK just yet....
2462 2018-12-28 19:36:32 While you are no doubt as suspect about Sekera’s ability to bounce back as I am, I think he should be on your list as well. He’ll be a factor in “weeks”.
2463 2018-12-28 19:36:09 Been dosing cbd oil for about a month now and I can say I'm a biggggg fan
2464 2018-12-28 19:35:55 Do you think the cbd oil at Chuck’s is a direct response to the Hoagie Shop closing?

2467 2018-12-28 19:35:36 @Jeep renegade annoyance number 47. It takes 5w40 full synthetic oil which means needing an oil change is like going on a treasure hunt because no one has the stuff

2470 2018-12-28 19:35:28 I would support 60% income taxes if the proceeds went in the bank to our kids' benefit.

I'd even support nationalizing our oil.
2471 2018-12-28 19:35:16 Should’ve used baby oil 
2472 2018-12-28 19:35:10 I’ll let you imagine the Worth Valley replacing all their gas / oil lamps with “pseudo brewery” stuff... anyway yup Happy New Year! Let’s see what 1901 brings! I’m off on night shift to shunt ScotRail DMU’s and HST’s, maybe a few pics as well.
2473 2018-12-28 19:35:08 Man I’m Just Tryna Get A Oil Change  And I Keep Getting Harassed
2474 2018-12-28 19:35:02 What amazes me is how these very same people claim to love capitalism don't get how it works. Plus they r ok with us subsizing the oil & fast food industries & whatever category Walmart falls under. Heavens forbid the people who work there should be able to eat or a see a doctor.
2475 2018-12-28 19:34:39 I don't want to answer you... enjoy what?? Spending 6years in school for a programme that's supposed to be 4years????...iss like your brain is dripping oil
2476 2018-12-28 19:34:37 obvi it works differently for everyone but that’s what i use and it all helped get rid of the rash i had around my mouth. rosehip oil helps too! it’s rejuvenating
2477 2018-12-28 19:34:36 Sickened, but not surprised.. They have made oil drilling cheap and crude again.. anything that helps the rich get richer.
2478 2018-12-28 19:34:28 Groupon usually has good deals on oil changes in your area. I used to go to Jiffy Lube

2480 2018-12-28 19:34:21 I need my oil changed, my tire pressure sensor on & my car note too high 
2481 2018-12-28 19:34:13 I wont recommend to decrease just yet as oil and gas market is very volatile at the moment. I would rather form price control comittees in districts to avoid over pricing of LPG by retailers/gas mafia.
2482 2018-12-28 19:33:59 If they find a way to improve their forward group, can the Oilers survive with a backend of Klefbom, Larsson, Jones, Bouchard, Russell, Gravel, Benning? If so, can Nurse land them a legit top-six forward? Just to be clear, these are moves Chiarelli's replacement makes.

2487 2018-12-28 19:33:31 That oil is yet to start being pumped. Likely won't affect the price of gas for another 5 years or so. But you're right in thinking that a higher supply of oil leads to lower prices, just it aint Guyana that is responsible right now.
2488 2018-12-28 19:33:23 Sometimes I feel like I’m on a show like Punkd. For example I am getting my cars oil changed and a guy around 70 walks in with a brown wig and a cotton candy tutu on acting like nothing is out of the normal. #ignoringit #maybeiamonashowandcouldwinmoney

2496 2018-12-28 19:31:49 In order to spend money, you first need to make money. Oil makes money and even if Canada gets out of the oil & gas industry. The hole will be filled by dirty oil from other countries.
2497 2018-12-28 19:31:49 I don't know about these oils you're trying out, but may want to look at Minoxidil oil and Nizoral shampoo. Its actually an effective regimen

2502 2018-12-28 19:31:22 Simply massage a couple of tablespoons of aloe vera gel into the skin for about 5 minutes, then rinse.

2503 2018-12-28 19:31:13 Does MCT oil count as generating from within or no is that more like an endogenous source?
2504 2018-12-28 19:31:10 Has anyone used CBD oil? What for & how did it work for you? I'm considering trying it for my chronic illnesses: migraine, anxiety, Mito. #cbd #chronicillness
2505 2018-12-28 19:31:07 Good fats such as avacado nuts etc like cashew and almonds and use only olive oil on your body. Hair and face.  It is the only thing that Sofia Lauren used and she has stayed beautiful.  Oatmeal is very good for eating and baths.  I hope it helps
2506 2018-12-28 19:31:05 I didn't think about that.. I guess the coconut oil could make your hair a little frizzy cuz it'll be extra clean, but the fructis really makes it super pretty. Try it!
2507 2018-12-28 19:30:52 As long as they only send us their best oil...
2508 2018-12-28 19:30:51 Cheers. I may have a slight bias as an Oil fan ;)
2509 2018-12-28 19:30:42 Rattie will start with 97-29 tomorrow. Rieder with Brodziak and Kassian.
Today had 91-93-98 and then 27-16-23 as lines. Khaira produced very well on RNH’s LW, but due to lack of centres looks like he could start at C tomorrow based on practice lines. #Oil

2514 2018-12-28 19:30:13 @ProfOsinbajo Your second term is so sure sir. But we needed to put all our refineries in working conditions as to meet our daily consumption or you mandate all oil companies operating in Nigeria to build new refineries and equally engaging in large scale farming. Thanks.

We won't see any new raise until the end of next year if at all. Q1 will show the lowest GDP growth and wages will keep their 3% rise. Oil will stay low

No. But if you catch it early enough you can sustain your head of hair for a long time. Thinking about jumping on it myself to preserve my own

2523 2018-12-28 19:29:45 Beaches are public amenities. They cannot be closed to the public unless there’s an exceptional circumstance like a oil spill or beached whale. A beach “shutdown” at 8pm is arbitrary & unlawful whether done by the city or a security co acting in cahoots with the city.  #Clifton

2526 2018-12-28 19:29:23 As olive oil in the kitchen has finished, can somebody quickly use anointing oil to fry egg? Asking for somebody.
2527 2018-12-28 19:28:57 it was clearly debunked. Sirota tried to make contributions from oil and gas EMPLOYEES out to be CORPORATE contributions from Oil and Gas.  So yes, Sirota's smear on Beto was debunked.  In fact, Sirota was hammered over those claims.  BECAUSE THEY WERE LIES.
2528 2018-12-28 19:28:47 If governments can do just fine without income taxes, why do all developed countries use them?  Of the top 10 countries without an income tax, 7 are oil states, and 3 are tax havens (Bermuda, Caymans, the Bahamas)
2529 2018-12-28 19:28:41  CBD has neuro-protective properties, which means it protects the cells of the nervous system, the brain and nerves in the body. 

 CBD has the ability to protect against cellular damage. 

 CBD does not have toxicity issues or serious side effects in the body

2535 2018-12-28 19:28:24 And idiots think wind and solar are the future. Look into both of these things and you’ll see that neither are as green as you think and both need oil.

The stuff is miraculous.
2538 2018-12-28 19:27:54 Yeah, you can vape the CBD oil...still no THC, so no high. I'm not a big fan of pot as a way to get high. Too many saws, tractors, and implements of destruction around here for that.
2539 2018-12-28 19:27:48  CBD is a naturally occurring constituent, hence cannabinoid of the Hemp plant and according to US government patent #6,630,507 it supports the nutritional health of aging bodies. 

 CBD has an anxiolytic effect, which means anti-anxiety.

2549 2018-12-28 19:27:25 Ya’ll remember the oil sands shutdown happened BEFORE Trudeau got involved with carbon taxes, etc, right? 

Maybe Alberta should take a hard look at itself, diversify and maybe start paying PST like the rest of us.

2571 2018-12-28 19:25:27 Not everyone can afford that kind of investment either from oil rich companies. Just saying it as it is

2594 2018-12-28 19:22:45 Taking 430 k from the oil industry for one.  Plus a whole lot of other donations that crossed his no fossil fuel pledge. Add to that clearly voting against what his proclaimed principles are and he’s not looking like the man I thought and hoped he was. Sad really. Very sad 
2595 2018-12-28 19:22:38 Will it block access to taking money from oil executives?
2596 2018-12-28 19:22:38 @AudiOfficial oil consumption issues should be a total recall for an Audi engineered problem straight off the line. #audi #audiusa #a4 #2.0t #germanenginering

2615 2018-12-28 19:21:04 Over the last 5 years, innovations to hydraulic fracturing (fracking) processes has unlocked vast sums of natural gas which is a substitute fuel. This has created a glut in the price of oil worldwide. I'd like yo hear your take on how #NAFTA has affected oil prices.

2618 2018-12-28 19:20:55 Let’s hear from cons in light of the fact that conservative governments have transformed a trillion dollar largesse from our Alberta oil into a prov. debt of more than 40 billion$.How do they justify this without as much of a peep as they envision Jason (same old) as their man.
2619 2018-12-28 19:20:50 Correct, so he should get linemates accordingly

2623 2018-12-28 19:20:12 Anyone who think a walk will stop immigrant is a moron. Why don't you really focus on the real problem. Corrupt Governments, hey but Central America doesn't have oil no help will or anyrhinf will be done. Besides USA immigration process is a joke.
2624 2018-12-28 19:20:07 Ngl bridal doesn’t control my oil either but for highlighter it’s so good makes it look like I’m glowing from within if that makes sense. I’ve not found a great spray yet
2625 2018-12-28 19:20:03 I wish this was @TomiLahren, but Tami wouldn’t dare be caught in public using an electric car, instead of fighting to save oil jobs! I’m pretty sure one of her life mottos is “Coal and oil! Coal and oil! Blood and soil!”...wait, that’s not right, is it? 
2626 2018-12-28 19:19:45 How much oil money can Beto take in?
2627 2018-12-28 19:19:44 Oh that explains it. You're a pro oil industry person. You should have said so in the first place.
2628 2018-12-28 19:19:41 Love the back peddling- finally they're admitting major US dollars being spent to kill our oil industry via the 'environmentalists' & first nations'. Miles foundation not only one. Our pm is killing it too - liberals don't understand where $ are & we need them for Can to survive
2629 2018-12-28 19:19:30 I want to get a new piercing but my car needs new tires and an oil change  and Im still not done with the gift shopping either
2630 2018-12-28 19:19:21 I’m currently getting my oil changed and I kept wondering why I couldn’t hear any of the videos I was trying to watch. Turns out my phone is still connected to my car’s Bluetooth. I hope the technicians enjoyed that video of Nicki Minaj singing.
2631 2018-12-28 19:19:15 Car cleaned, oil changed, now I need my system fixed
2632 2018-12-28 19:19:13 @AudiOfficial should fix any factory issue regardless of any warranty programs. Oil consumption problems should be on recall for it is a known issue straight from factory.  so tired of putting money into this AUDI!
2633 2018-12-28 19:18:57 Add a little oil
2634 2018-12-28 19:18:57 Does that also mean no oil exports to the US and all trade comes to a stop as well as all tourism

2640 2018-12-28 19:18:25 Justin Trudeau also, like Obama, had zero permission from Libs or incentive to reject oil companies when all jobs- growth was seen as coming from oil. There's a NEW libs urgency now & both Justin & Barack would do things differently if they had a do over. Things have changed.
2641 2018-12-28 19:18:24 @elonmusk Will Teslas ever be officially available in Russia? Or is the fact that Russia has its own oil a deterrent (I am surprised that Tesla isn't a European company, being honest).
2642 2018-12-28 19:18:24 Actually otra reason why I get into fights w/ the leftist squad the oil industry has been preparing for this day for years. They are some of the largest investors in renewable energy. And part of getting ppl to move from fossil to EV power cars willl be the conversion of tanks
2643 2018-12-28 19:18:20 I doubt anyone ever said nasty, congealed vegetable oil was delicious. Butter, on the other hand, makes everything it touches taste better.
2644 2018-12-28 19:18:18 How come I don't hear on the mainstream media about the Russians moving into Venezuela taking over the oil setting up a base for their nuclear bomber are we looking at another Cuban crisis
2645 2018-12-28 19:18:12 I love the Shea Moisture black castor oil mask it’s so moisturising, olive oil is good too
2646 2018-12-28 19:18:10 Turkey wants the oil under the feet of iraqi Kurds, and the elimination of Syria’s Kurds. Period

2648 2018-12-28 19:18:02 I ve watched this, and I really think a lot of it was unproven. People have choice to eat what they want. Just remember vegetable farming is far more intensive, increased soil erosion, leachate and requires large fertiliser inputs mostly from oil products.

2656 2018-12-28 19:16:53 Somebody pls tell my mum that price and quality do SOMETIMES correlate. 

I was happy to find my olive oil was on sale for £2.49 (from like £4?) and she had a go at me for not buying the supermarket own brand one 

Like I don’t earn my own damn wage to know the value of things
2657 2018-12-28 19:16:42 Not the case. The price of is impossible to measure. The human cost, deaths, injuries, pollution, marriages wrecked, drink, drugs, the list is endless. The value of oil is measured on indices where it is traded on futures markets. That clear enough for you now?

We also import medical from Latin America, wood and steel, even oil. We export to them for $ that we need...
2677 2018-12-28 19:15:40 Oh 100% agree with what you said about Trump. I just think it's a bit naive of Mr. Painter to believe that soldiers "defend our right to have free elections" more than they are used by the government, no matter which party, to gain geopolitical power, oil, and other resources.

2690 2018-12-28 19:13:31 I do give him bigley credit for bringing our troops home.  Let's send Dickey Cheney and lizy Cheney to fight oil wars for profit.  Those two cowards  could do it "if they only had the nerve".

2695 2018-12-28 19:12:22 They didn’t die for Iraq. The soldiers on both sides and its civilians died because of a lie of WMDs that didn’t exist all so a bunch of American crooks could satisfy the military industrial complex and control Iraq’s oil which is second richest deposits in the world.
2696 2018-12-28 19:12:02 Tea tree oil! Apply the oil to the affected areas before you go sleep and you should see results.

2699 2018-12-28 19:11:15 Ppl must be using oil pastels these days to draw on their eyebrows cause that’s the only explanation I can think of as to why everybody got wet creamy lookin brows. I loved using oil pastels in elementary school tho they r fun!
2700 2018-12-28 19:11:10 That’s BS. It’s been the most boring 3 hrs on twitter since I followed you. Plus I need to keep hearing it to stay in my position. I’m in (oil down). Is that still happening?
2701 2018-12-28 19:11:09 That dielectric oil poisons groundwater
2702 2018-12-28 19:11:09 Nope wrong, there is an oversupply of oil which is why it's price is plunging.  #divest #opecmeet
2703 2018-12-28 19:11:07 U know what makes this worse is the fact that on the first one he uses like an oil painting filter lol

2709 2018-12-28 19:10:44 Just plugged in this oil diffuser I got for Christmas and I think my life is already changing.
2710 2018-12-28 19:10:42 Because making a person beholden to fossil fuel and oil companies the chair of your climate change committee is the dumbest fucking idea I've ever seen.
2711 2018-12-28 19:10:40 THC oil is a controlled substance, learn something new everyday
2712 2018-12-28 19:10:38 Low gas prices are a result of oil prices tanking. Not because of you or your pal Ford. Next time try the truth. We, the 60% who didn't vote for you, are not stupid.
2713 2018-12-28 19:10:37 Lucic was not brought in to solely be a "respect & protection" guy, as those guys don't make $6M per. He's earned his way onto the line he finds himself and the argument could be made he should spend some time in the press box.
2714 2018-12-28 19:10:24 I was correcting the original tweet when he was referring to the price of oil and I pointed out it should be value of oil. What is your problem with that?
2715 2018-12-28 19:10:24 @lindsaylohan what in the hell is going on with you. You better recognized.  You is not on United states soil.  They gonna find your body under a oil well. Lmbo
2716 2018-12-28 19:10:19 First of all Big Al’s didn’t show me the little oil stick thing and I may not know what it means but I do know they’re obligated to show me the little oil stick thing.

2718 2018-12-28 19:10:09 WE caused the problems in Venezuela ... as we have done in South America for generations. Then we blame them. Oil is why we interfere with those nations, destroying their economies, in order to topple their elected officials to replace them with our puppets. Ven is fighting this.

2721 2018-12-28 19:09:50 Conservatives still think clean coal and oil is the future 
2722 2018-12-28 19:09:47 Oh, I do! But when a democratic vote is swung by lies, how is it truly democratic? The oil will run out in 2014 - months later new oil fields found. Miraculous! Vote No and be guaranteed to stay in EU - oops! That worked! Merry Christmas and all the best for 2019!
2723 2018-12-28 19:09:44 Cheap as chips bicarbonate of soda with a little lavender oil or other oil does the same trick too, those carpet powders worry me especially with pets about
2724 2018-12-28 19:09:43 1) It’s weird how you conflate wars for oil that resulted in over a million deaths to someone being embarrassed b/c her private advocacy for those wars was made public. Seems like two very different definitions of “violated”

2) No one is celebrating shit

3) The DNC’s own rules.
2725 2018-12-28 19:09:34 Bread and oil
2726 2018-12-28 19:09:32 $ATLS .0063?! a market cap of $204K & generates $9.05 million in revs each year?! Should be at 24 CENTS
At $50 dollars a barrel the production rate of 1240 barrels per day would put the revenue over 22mil current oil price.
Fellas ATLS was just at 3 cents a month ago. $XOM $BP
2727 2018-12-28 19:09:31 I’m bout to just put bandersnatch on & not choose shit while I put olive oil in my hair. Let’s see what this weirdo has for breakfast now.
2728 2018-12-28 19:09:29 Of course I would have a high maintenance car that requires full synthetic oil  I really shouldn’t have expected anything less 
2729 2018-12-28 19:09:25 How do you run a committee, with a goal of clean energy independence  - that doesn't have subpoena power, but DOES have a lot of corrupt oil folks on it?
What is @NancyPelosi thinking?
She doesn't want her job anymore?
2730 2018-12-28 19:09:21 Someone is telling me to come and buy butt enlargement oil 
2731 2018-12-28 19:09:19 As a fellow Texan we need to get ahead of the issue and transition jobs in oil and gas to renewables. We don’t have a choice and we have 10 years to do it.
2732 2018-12-28 19:09:17 Tommie Oil Hot trash

2736 2018-12-28 19:08:52 HANDLING OUT OF OIL BLOCKS
Allocation of the oil blocks during the Atiku time as VP was hardly transparent and this was due to the fact that over 60 oil blocks were handed over to friends who had no idea of the oil industry.
2737 2018-12-28 19:08:47 Dating A black with oil.
2738 2018-12-28 19:08:28 Right there with you honey, wish l could gouge mine out to. Some sprays can help. We have olbas oil over here, it's a natural remedy and really works if you can get it over there. If not curries always work for me x hope you feel better soon honey xxx
2739 2018-12-28 19:08:22 He's not a "big oil" democrat. He received donations from people who work in the oil industry. It's Texas. Being a red state democrat also explains his voting history.
2740 2018-12-28 19:08:21 Price of oil and value of oil are 2 separate things.
2741 2018-12-28 19:08:19 This implies that there are only choices about how we move the oil. Not if we move or even use the oil.

I'd be supportive of plans to (hopefully safely) move the oil if we were advised of a plan to wean ourselves from fossil fuels. Without such a plan, we're screwed.
2742 2018-12-28 19:08:07 Skill india program is awsm but how it improve empyment After #Apprenticeship no one get a job in thier Field and specially in oil industry in india there is no chance to get a job in oil compny after compeltng #Apprenticeship pls take a action towards this. Thank u.@dpradhanbjp
2743 2018-12-28 19:08:00 @fordnation is a fool because anyone can easily Google to see global oil price decline or watch the news to see he is lying. Carbon tax has never been implemented yet so how is it even "removed"
2744 2018-12-28 19:07:54 No he’s revelling in the SNPs entire economic plan for independence  which  was around oil at 135 a barrel if I remember rightly. And had they won the vote Scotland would have had an IMF bailout etc etc. So in a way revelling in the fact people still have a job.
2745 2018-12-28 19:07:53 all them haters and big oil ate a WHOLE JAR OF OLIVES with big oil to get exactly what nobody knows

2749 2018-12-28 19:07:30 Ima wash my hair and give myself a hot oil treatment 
2750 2018-12-28 19:07:18 Unfortunately since her Dr told her what he did she won't try it. She sees how much it helps me but wanted to run it by her Dr 1st. She's older than me. He was adamant it's bad & she takes what he says as gospel. I suggested CBD oil and he knocked that down too. Pushes rxs. Sad
2751 2018-12-28 19:07:12 Putin: Thanks to this oil boom, Russians will love me and forget about silly socialism!
>Oil busts
>Putin’s approval rating goes down

Putin: Crap... I should’ve diversified the economy.
2752 2018-12-28 19:07:01 Back in the day, they use to have some pretty good ways of torturing people. 

In my opinion, we should bring some back for this guy. 

The Rack?
The Iron Maiden?
Slow Roasting?
Drawn and Quartered?
Boiled in Oil?
Turkas?
The Wheel?

Quick death is too good for this bastard!

2759 2018-12-28 19:06:48 A young, fit, strong male is a marketable asset, so use it while you have it.  Be a roughneck on the oil patch for a few years, earn a couple hundred thousand, then go to university without student loans (just as an example).
2760 2018-12-28 19:06:29 I think I take evening showers looking forward to smearing my body with this oil 
2761 2018-12-28 19:06:29 Yes. However, the question is how seamless the movement of people in to new jobs would be. One would imagine oil engineers would have transferable skills. Pig farmers in developing world trickier. Also I should've caveat-ed that the vegan diet would have to be low rice too.
2762 2018-12-28 19:06:25 sigh I will go get the oil then to help you *giggles*
2763 2018-12-28 19:06:23 Norway's oil production pays $72/ton of CO2. Alberta pays $50, almost 50% less. You're getting off easy. The investment is going south because Permian Basin oil is cheap to extract & needs very little refining. I personally want the pipelines to be built, but safely.
2764 2018-12-28 19:06:10 And if you break my heart na oil spillage
2765 2018-12-28 19:05:56 We realize Lucic was brought in for reasons like respect, & protection.  But in his more ‘productive goal scoring’ seasons he hadn’t been paired with a couple of plugs.  Sorry but his linemates have been a bust.
2766 2018-12-28 19:05:43 -There are 8 Dem HC plans currently. Which have you chosen & why?
-Free public college plans are partially a state funding issue.
-Which ACA vote specifically?
-Dereg finance? Like Sanders vote to dereg Wall Street.
-Oil/gas industry? Which votes.

Ps-don't be a sexist pig.
2767 2018-12-28 19:05:22 Many moving parts, i agree with the draft army, rich kids, privileged first though, Senators, House members kids, so they think three times before a deployment. Oil is that other moving part, less dependence on oil, we would never look twice at the Middle East.
2768 2018-12-28 19:05:22 i waited too long to get an oil change so my engine messed up
2769 2018-12-28 19:05:13 A friend has a “Tight Hole” rubber stamp from his days in the oil industry

2772 2018-12-28 19:05:03 Your client was on his own and the oil flew and hit him smack on the face, we know. He is too innocent to touch the oil and digital evidence is not really permissible so case closed.

2775 2018-12-28 19:04:51 It doesn't bleed when u get it done professionally
It heals in 2/3 weeks and doesn't hurt unless it gets irritated by something. 
Buy some drops they'll offer you.
Keep it clean with that and move it around slowly sometimes.

If it gets really irritated and stuff use tree tea oil

2784 2018-12-28 19:03:48 Yes, OPSEC and the world's top oil producing countries are cutting their production because "Canada doesn't have enough pipeline capacity". Lmfao good grief, keep drinking the kool-aid.

2789 2018-12-28 19:03:06 The fact that I can be suffering from a full blown migraine but a small bit of CBD oil can prevent me from being completely incapacitated is amazing.
2790 2018-12-28 19:03:02 So, what do the oil companies think?

-Generously salt. 
-Add a knob of butter

2796 2018-12-28 19:02:25 I followed Dan in good faith thinking he knew what he was talking about. Lost lots of money on “inside info” that he had in a private group. Stay away from the snake oil
2797 2018-12-28 19:02:19 Au États-Unis, le prix du litre d'essence est de 60 cts, le gaz oil n'existe pas et pour cause. Chez eux pas de transition énergétique, ni de réchauffement climatique. Trump aime ses concitoyens et veut leur bien-être. Pas chez nous malheureusement.
2798 2018-12-28 19:02:14 Got my oil changed this morning and ran a bunch of errands today. Keenan told me it's good that he comes along to help me do all the things. Apparently I know nothing and cannot get through the target line on my own. 
2799 2018-12-28 19:02:07 The really sad thing about stuff like that is that for a real economy that oil is peanuts. It might be an option to just start buying loyalty, probably cheaper than deploying troops.

2806 2018-12-28 19:01:13 How does a hacker make a transformer explode? It is a passive device. If anything went wrong it would be a dielectric failure in the cooling oil. That sort of thing is usually detected via a Buchholz relay. Those r mechanical, not sure hacker cud interfere w that.

2810 2018-12-28 19:01:02 The food industry is tied to the FDA, which is tied to Big Pharma, which is tied to healthcare, which is tied to the oil/chemical industry, which is tied back to government. Hippocrates said: food is your medicine, medicine is your food. Wonder why we're so sick? Ask the govt.

2824 2018-12-28 18:58:46 Another promise in the making- obviously since the oil issue was a hoax and the expired drugs were there for all to see you have to find another loophole to quell the masses you are robbing their livelihoods through 2%.

2827 2018-12-28 18:58:39 idk what Argan Oil is, but i know it’s in all my girls shower stuff and i know it makes my beard soft as f**k...
2828 2018-12-28 18:58:36 The hard left is using the same tactics that used against Obama. For example, by using the listed employer of small money contributions from workers, they are claiming Beto is taking money from "big oil".

It is disingenuous and manufactured.
2829 2018-12-28 18:58:27 I’m cross referencing them for major supporters of Kenney campaign. Basically several far right American consequentialist libertarian think tanks are throwing money at Canadian right wing think tanks, and have been for years. Not just Kochs. Oil money is apparently plentiful.

2841 2018-12-28 18:57:30 Whatever happened to peak oil? As long as FF provide cheap & reliable energy, there is no reason to use expensive & non-reliable renewables. You actually seem reasonable. Try to learn more about AGW & what these agencies are trying to do to purposely manipulate data points
2842 2018-12-28 18:57:22 Seems I recall Golda Meir joking about the Jews (Zionists, really, with respect to Jews who are not) being led to the one place in the Middle East without oil...
Now it's hard not to wonder if this WHOLE war is a charade to change that.
2843 2018-12-28 18:57:18 So this is what the old time Snake  Oil salesmen sounded like.

2850 2018-12-28 18:56:39 We must accelerate the energy system switch because we will run out of proven oil & gas reserves in the decades ahead (EIA, USGS, IPCC). 50 & 70% of total oil & gas reserves are unproven guesstimates, & earth will return to the cold during this grand solar minimum.

2852 2018-12-28 18:56:33 Want to talk about the 40% of your oil you get from Canada? The electricity that keeps Cali and New York lit up? The natural gas that keeps your houses warm? The water because we have the most fresh water in the world and our lumber we cut while you rake your forests?
2853 2018-12-28 18:56:18 As the reliance on oil gets less and less the price will keep dropping. How can you say you’ll build an economy on a fuel that’s had its day.

2865 2018-12-28 18:55:10 Beto stopped taking PAC $s in 2014 & refused PAC $s in senate campaign. His 800,000 plus contributions came from individual donors & 46% were under $200. Donations from oil & gas were low compared to other occupations, like human rights, civil service, education, healthcare, etc

2867 2018-12-28 18:54:41 So I was in Karachi from past few days and I saw Ahad's Meezan Cooking oil poster somewhere on the streets.... " I shouted Ahad dikh gaya "

My Bro : " Gaari ka colour btao "
My Dad : trying to find him 
My Mom : uninterestedly" Hadh hoti hai "
2868 2018-12-28 18:54:39 The inflation is artificial mate. Ok example me and my 10 capital holding buddies go out and buy all the oil for sale at X price and relist for Y. The bulk of my volume makes all sellers under me sell out or relist their product to sell along side Y prices not X for less money.
2869 2018-12-28 18:54:27 That way fuel cells would be cheaper and the public wouldn't own this reducing cost of initial purchase of electric vehicles. 
Which is identical to existing oil based fuels.
You could even tax the cells in future so that those using the cells paid more
2870 2018-12-28 18:54:25 It's them acting more like an oil transporter and vendor and less like a producer.

2881 2018-12-28 18:52:59 Venezuela sells a island to Putin . Putin also buys oil companies in Venezuela. Two bombers fly to Venezuela, are they still there?
2882 2018-12-28 18:52:59 Rachel  we understand the need  for pipelines and getting a good price for our oil.  Ottawa needs to pull up their socks and get on with it. They have spent to much time with consultations and looking at their navels. Wake up Trudeau.
2883 2018-12-28 18:52:53 ya but IMO 2020 should widen spread and make heavy cheaper - win for consumers of heavy/black oil
2884 2018-12-28 18:52:53 Beto doesn't support medicare for all, and doesn't support free public college, voted with republicans to hurt ACA, deregulate finance, and promote oil and gas industries. He's a DINO. But I guess that's fine with you cause he's cute or something.
2885 2018-12-28 18:52:52 Very good point, even liberal pundits on US news outlets were predicting skyrocketing oil prices if Iran's oil was removed from the market

2891 2018-12-28 18:52:20 not piety, but self-interest. They have sold coal investments and using shared district heating network. To expect them to leave their oil under the sea, might be politically a bridge too far?
2892 2018-12-28 18:52:14 Get a oil change and smoke my day away
2893 2018-12-28 18:52:13 Get to know Beto O'Rourke:

- Opposes Medicare for all (HR 676)
- Opposes college for all (HR 1880)
- 2nd largest recipient of Oil & Gas money (2018)
- Voted 3x to increase Trump's military budget (HR 2810, 5515 & 6157)
- Opposes a ban on offshore drilling (H.R. 2242 / S. 750)
2894 2018-12-28 18:52:02 Beto O'Rourke? The guy who backed off his support for medicare for all? The guy who took over 400000 from big oil executives? The guy who is pro TPP and blindly supports Israel?

Kamala Harris voted for counter aggression measures against Iran, Russia and NK.

2898 2018-12-28 18:51:52 I use a shoe string and when my hair dry I moisturize with Shea butter then seal it with Jamaican black castor oil
2899 2018-12-28 18:51:52 It’s the VALUE of oil and it’s $53.20 tonight. The PRICE of oil is something rather different. The value of oil is currently down due to Captain Idiot of the USA. However, markets expect to see Brent crude level circa $60 p/bbl by end of Q1
2900 2018-12-28 18:51:37 Here is a Scientific fact, Obama had nothing to do with boosting fuel production.  Stating/believing otherwise is utter political BS or stupidity. 

Increased fracking happened due to capital investment triggered by high oil prices.

2905 2018-12-28 18:51:31 Good riddance. Try to survive as your temporary economic bubble created by the oil industry bursts in your face while the whole world is moving towards renewable energies.
2906 2018-12-28 18:51:29 Of course not everyone is hurting... and some individuals will continue to do well. But on average, in general, many many people in Alberta are feeling the effects of the war being waged on the oil and gas sector in Alberta.

2910 2018-12-28 18:51:09 It's a pretty solid article. Helped me understand why I suddenly got attacked this week for supporting Tulsi Gabbard and got called a "right wing Hindu nationalist"  - same website ran an article attacking Beto for getting money from people who work in oil & gas. (hello Texas)

You would think a historian would understand this.
2915 2018-12-28 18:50:41 I agree with that but I don't like his pro oil votes. However, I love Beto and I would work my buns off to get him elected.
2916 2018-12-28 18:50:38 Bet. Ill try once I get some good color pencils or oil colors.

2930 2018-12-28 18:48:44 The temporary economic bubble that you created with the oil industry is simply bursting in your face while the whole world is moving towards renewable energies. It was so easy to see it coming, but the right don't think much about the long term impact of their bad decisions.

2948 2018-12-28 18:47:01 I assume the things you want done for Ab. are the urgently needed new school curricula, as well as much tougher regulations for major polluters. The planet is imperilled and I, too, am disappointed that the Ab. gov is so cozy with oil companies.
2949 2018-12-28 18:46:59 Kandi-Cane, these MAN-HANDS can handle anything. I hope you like oil. You and me? We can make a HumanMANtipede.
2950 2018-12-28 18:46:53 Look the sad fact is to be successful in politics money is a necessity and it doesn’t come from thin air. So if a person better person than 45 comes along who accepted Oil money but some naive voters say I’m not voting for him because “Oil” guess who keeps winning??
2951 2018-12-28 18:46:52 Who ate the sheep liver? Nothing taste better than fresh liver sautéed in a bit of oil and red onion #OccupyCliftonBeach
2952 2018-12-28 18:46:52 Waiting at the dealership for my oil to be changed and this girl has moved around the waiting room about 5 times to find the right lighting for her selfie... get it girl #selfie #fridaystory 
2953 2018-12-28 18:46:51 #mojchlopak kupił mi bio Oil na moje oparzenia na wszelki wypadek by blizn na pewno nie było, więc dam wam znać czy działa i czy warto kupić, bo mam dość obszerne ślady po oparzeniach

2955 2018-12-28 18:46:44 How I need ANOTHER OIL CHANGE?????
2956 2018-12-28 18:46:38 When I applied argon oil to it and let it grown
2957 2018-12-28 18:46:26 Can you be rational enough to also give Obama credit for reducing oil consumption in ways that will keep paying off years from now? If we don't reduce consumption it's just a NIMBYism argument about getting it from here or the Middle East.
2958 2018-12-28 18:46:15 The forces aligned to push the climate change narrative are just as plausible as the idea that oil companies are just killing the science with money. That is why there needs to be a red team, blue team on this subject.
2959 2018-12-28 18:46:13 I was 17 in '70. We were still reeling from the Vietnam war-then Watergate. Despite Disco, music was still great. SNL. Avocado green appliances. Some of us believed inequality and racism w/b gone soon. Space program decline; but great scientific discoveries. Oil crisis. Walkman.
2960 2018-12-28 18:45:56 The only incentive he has is the truth. You can literally read his TL & see the moment someone posted how much money Beto got from Big Oil & he quote-Tweeted it to how doing a deep dive into Beto’s voting record was formed as a story idea. This is no grand conspiracy.
2961 2018-12-28 18:45:55 Lord I need my oil back.. please have mercy on my soul.. I’m so sorry
2962 2018-12-28 18:45:50 ppl really think immaterial and not ponyboy is the best song off oil of every pearl's un-insides smh !!!
2963 2018-12-28 18:45:48 Oil is a bigger issue IMHO..
2964 2018-12-28 18:45:41 Yep! I know how to do both jumping and changing my tire...and could easily change my oil if I needed to, I just haven’t done it yet because I’m lazy lol
2965 2018-12-28 18:45:15 Old transformer from the 60s exploded and the oil inside caught fire.  No big deal.  There are 87000 transformers in NY and couple blow up each year
2966 2018-12-28 18:45:13 Dem fit mix small engine oil put for the breast milk kwa
2967 2018-12-28 18:45:11 Norway. Where all the money comes from oil.
2968 2018-12-28 18:45:11 only my albanian mother would snort OLIVE OIL up her nose to clear out her sinuses. why are we so foreign
2969 2018-12-28 18:44:42 Recession may be. Oil & coal companies would go bankrupt.
2970 2018-12-28 18:44:37 Peak oil is fear mongering, people have said we have hit peak oil numerous times over the last 50 years, the chances that now finally they are correct is low IMO.
2971 2018-12-28 18:44:36 S/o to the adults that opened indomie oil packs for me
2972 2018-12-28 18:44:34 Mack is an average coach, but the man is a snake oil salesmen on the recruiting trail. High school coaches would relate to a well respected pier. It’s just a thought, but I also don’t get paid 3 million a year to make those decisions. Lol
2973 2018-12-28 18:44:32 I’m never cooking with coconut oil again. My eggs tasted like coconuts 
2974 2018-12-28 18:44:29 The nation’s attitude was dark and depressed, with Watergate, oil embargoes, stagflation, 20% mortgages, Carter’s malaise.  But it was also the decade of the second British Invasion, Elvis Costello, The Clash et al. revitalized music.
2975 2018-12-28 18:44:26 sooo my oil is leaking..
2976 2018-12-28 18:44:13 ส่วนตัวนี่รู้สึกว่ายิ่งโตยิ่งไม่อยากรู้จักใครเพิ่มอ่ะขก.มาเรียนรู้นิสัยใจคอกันตอนแรกๆเหนื่อยจะเริ่มใหม่พอผิดหวังก็วนลูปเดิมๆน่าเบื่อ
2977 2018-12-28 18:44:09 got and oil change and cleaned out my car 
2978 2018-12-28 18:44:06 Depends what's attached and how far away from being a decent team my team is.
2979 2018-12-28 18:43:47 Great things for Russia, North Korea, Saudi Arabia & Turkey too!

Great things for the 1% & oil, gas, chemical, banks & insurance.

Great things for corrupt politicians, corrupt judges & corrupt appointees.

& for America the GOP gave us the greatest Constitutional betrayal ever!
2980 2018-12-28 18:43:46 wit another lies and propaganda, d crude oil u said in 2019 dat it will b around $60 per barel is now around $50 per barel
2981 2018-12-28 18:43:39 Advantan fatty oil
2982 2018-12-28 18:43:35 Put coconut oil at night
2983 2018-12-28 18:43:29 From engine repairs to oil changes, our mechanics have you covered. Call us today.
2984 2018-12-28 18:43:26 hey uh malaysia i know palm oil's our thing and i was 2 weeks ago old when i learnt that it's actually bad for the environment bc my scienve class lied to me so can we not do this
2985 2018-12-28 18:43:24 I'm cooking for the first time in I've forgotten how long, and it's a bit epic. The last piece of beef in the freezer was 2kg, and cooking that much beef means a lot of garlic, onions, aubergine, tomatoes, oil, spices, herbs...
2986 2018-12-28 18:43:16 We in Nigeria will rather depend on oil revenue and argue among ourselves the expediency of State Governors to decide who to permit the use of stadium for political campaigns. Its sad.
2987 2018-12-28 18:43:16 Not sure how you plan on using it but I always dilute tee tree oil with some other oil for my hair and skin & it helps with the overpowering smell!
2988 2018-12-28 18:43:10 okay but i love the leave in conditioner + some oil it’s so thick
2989 2018-12-28 18:42:58 This so much. I love sonic mania as much as the next guy, but, i don’t know if it’s just the nature of having oil ocean, lava reef, and metallic madness before the awesome titanic monarch, but i just HAVE to stop after mirage saloon.
2990 2018-12-28 18:42:57 @CNN The people who LOVE sound of WAR-DRUMS are NEVER those who SUIT-UP and have THEMSELVES deployed to theaters-of-war! Ever notice? Those chasing Assad for his scalp are same who pursued/murdered SADDAM & QADDAFI! Remove STRONG MEN from Middle East BIG OIL so West can prevail!
2991 2018-12-28 18:42:52 whatever it is looks beautiful,  you are very lucky. 
2992 2018-12-28 18:42:47 no mind me, brake oil add money, the light self burn.. i just replace am last week..
2993 2018-12-28 18:42:46 Every damn time I get my oil change they try and charge me $1000. bruhhhhhh
2994 2018-12-28 18:42:44 Time to have a back up plan for such an emergency. 

1. Back up power generator. 
2. Water, food. 
3. Candles, flash lights, oil lamps.
4. Keep cellphones charged up.
2995 2018-12-28 18:42:41 Good point. We're ruled by and idiot. Obviously the only solution is to throw standards or Hope's for a functioning government out the window and instead vote in a guy who takes money from oil exec's and tended to vote with Trump more than Democrats, cause hey! "Lesser Evil!" 
2996 2018-12-28 18:42:40 And even if landlords and mortgage holders agree to delayed payments, there are insurance payments, heating oil or LP tanks running low, property tax installment payments coming due (whose defaults can accelerate when taxes are delinquent, and are statutory)
2997 2018-12-28 18:42:35 If a fashion designer could be awarded an oil well tell me who else cannot get one. It is all about the connnects
2998 2018-12-28 18:42:20 I have found that my hair is healthier when I use As I Am coconut cowash with Aussie conditioner. Then I use Creme of Nature moisture whip and mousse for my twist outs and afro. Finish it off with Isoplus coconut oil sheen.
2999 2018-12-28 18:42:18 So at first you all were worried that there was going to be huge increase in tanker traffic, and now you’re worried there won’t be enough oil for the terminal for said traffic?....I’m getting the feeling you just like to bitch about everything and anything related to O&G
3000 2018-12-28 18:42:09 May Allah forgive the soul of Alhaji Shehu Shagari and grant him Jannatul Firdaus as a final abode.
Really influential to my dad's success in business as he use to tell us.
3001 2018-12-28 18:41:55 My dad is a small business owner. Most of his business comes from the oil and gas industry. But he is struggling because of the lack of projects. Liberals don't care about a small business nor does the NDP.
3002 2018-12-28 18:41:54 According to science, so far, cloves has the highest antioxidant ORAC score, with cinnamon being a close second. The strongest natural antibiotic is oil of wild oregano. The Purdue company is now giving it to their chickens instead of drug antibiotics. 
3003 2018-12-28 18:41:50 I mean, McDavid takes a lot of shit and abuse that goes uncalled and this is the play you pick? There’s no call here. Sat in a room full of Oil fans for this one and not one wanted it called. Look at the 4 other camera angles that don’t give you the conclusion you want.
3004 2018-12-28 18:41:41 "Donor class", lol. Here in tx that would be ordinary ppl donating to beto.  He took zero pac money. But let me guess, u believe the lie that it was oil and gas " industry" bc ppl have to indicate their field and ppl actually work in that field here.  So what.
3005 2018-12-28 18:41:40 Although we don’t count oil to make money.
3006 2018-12-28 18:41:35 Watching this Yoruba movie and the blood looks like Fanta/Palm Oil.. I’ve never been more confused
3007 2018-12-28 18:41:35 yeah, i used it for my entire healing process on both of my tattoos. i used Louann’s Organic Coconut Oil and just got a little on my finger and rubbed it in when they were getting dry. they healed perfectly!
3008 2018-12-28 18:41:34 The oil is exactly what they have been after all along!
3009 2018-12-28 18:41:26 $26 oil change ... I missed Laurinburg man
3010 2018-12-28 18:41:26 You mean humans can only evolve to be more omnivorous rather than less? I can't think of anything that proves it one way or the other, but if true then an increasing population is going to mean a reduction in animal production. Just like the oil is going to run out.
3011 2018-12-28 18:41:13 I view him as a borderline guy but I also viewed Sandberg as that guy and he got in easy. The benefits that come with being the face of the Cubbies for 15 years ;)
3012 2018-12-28 18:41:07 i tried oil painting once and yeah.... never again lol
3013 2018-12-28 18:41:04 they locking cats heavily up for THC oil because that’s the least tampered with in terms of purity. They fucking with y’all bushes to get that oil.. think about it.
3014 2018-12-28 18:41:01 Oil blocs, Tax holidays and Dollar deals I have none from Government but this little light of mine will continue to shine by His Grace to light up the path of millions of citizens till they manifest & prosper. We all have our uniqueness & must never be subdued or intimidated.
3015 2018-12-28 18:41:00 What To Do 
~ Use Oils  (castor oil, olive oil, coconut oil, lemongrass oil, etc). Using oils will moisturise your hair and can also prevent breakage. Lemongrass oil is also proven to strengthen hair follicles and prevent and reduce hair loss.
3016 2018-12-28 18:40:56 I think, you know, we do understand Texas and the oil and gas industries. That’s why lots of us choose to live elsewhere. 
3017 2018-12-28 18:40:51 Who was doing big  business with IS dealing with stolen oil from Syria prior to 2015? Turkey.
It took Russian intervention to destroy that immoral deal. Who is drinking tea today with IS brothers, Al-Qaida (Nusra) in Idlib today? Turkey.
Where are your 100 lies!
Be honest!
3018 2018-12-28 18:40:45 Mr.Galati,I'm a conservative&needed help for a temp mental issue thx to,cbd oil&possible emf harrasement but ended up in some sort of reduction camp in East York GM Hospital in Sept 22nd&believe I'm still being harassed&may contact you for legal help if it continues @ezralevant
3019 2018-12-28 18:40:44 What fact? Do you actually believe that there would be any oil without demand from the West? Do you believe that there are no people in those countries that are not benefitting? All of these countries need to take responsibility and stop blaming the West.
3020 2018-12-28 18:40:40 Imagine you can't find cooking oil in a supermarket and you start blaming the poor till operator
3021 2018-12-28 18:40:25 You are deluded if you think striking in the midst of an energy crises is irrelevant. Remember the 3 day week in the 80s following the second oil crises? No! 

The Labour/unions can do no harm nonsense laughable.

3024 2018-12-28 18:40:18 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.
3025 2018-12-28 18:40:17 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
3026 2018-12-28 18:40:16 DON'T FORGET THAT $5.2 BILLION OF OIL CANNOT BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY #PETROJAM

EVERYONE INVOLVED NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.
3027 2018-12-28 18:40:11 Hey Numbnutts! I said criticize the guy but don’t politicize them, you sound like Jason Kenny’s jock strap ball sweat. It’s patently false to say he’s against the Oil Industry when clearly he’s not. I am, so I know what I’m talking about unlike yourself.
3028 2018-12-28 18:40:08 I wouldn't trust him to change the oil on my car.
3029 2018-12-28 18:40:05 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！
3030 2018-12-28 18:40:03 アツ
3031 2018-12-28 18:40:00 Rat-fracker?
A new source for oil and....
gas?
3032 2018-12-28 18:39:48 Someone forgot to change transformer oil? And they believe they are ready to colonize Mars?
3033 2018-12-28 18:39:47 we talk about depression meals all the time but what about depression HYGIENE?? just used coconut oil hair mist as perfume at least my clothes will be soft. 2 in 1

3037 2018-12-28 18:39:23 I tried vaping but I really don't want the high. Just the relaxation and pain relief. I ordered some oil last night.
3038 2018-12-28 18:39:15 Shouldn't oil/gas industry cash include money taken through PACs? Genuine q. Because Beto definitely didn't take that and doesn't seem to be reported on that link. Appears to be only from execs/individuals working at oil companies.
3039 2018-12-28 18:39:11 They don’t know what the oil price is - they think as long as it’s there, they’ll all get a free Bentley off Chief Mammy.
3040 2018-12-28 18:39:03 akshully tea tree oil for his problem areas. 
3041 2018-12-28 18:39:00 Tell me again how Trudeau is not a traitor. He puts international issues and laws above Canada. He constantly puts Quebec above the rest of Canada. They should be the first province to suffer blackouts and gas/oil shortages. 
3042 2018-12-28 18:39:00 I’m an adult and I’m still not comfortable taking my car to get an oil change... #Help
3043 2018-12-28 18:38:50 V2 developed the “here and now” process: vegetable oil appears in the  product (here) during the application of the product (now).The  technology creates a series of products called "HOPE" for cosmetics,  cooking, food with a therapeutic effect. V2 sells know-how. #invention
3044 2018-12-28 18:38:47 As long as the US leaves Eastern Syria. Syrians want their #OilFields back. Eastern Syria has 80% of known Oil Suppy in Syria. They need the income. Who has been profiting from the sale of Syrian Oil over the last several years. Any suggestion on whose making themselves rich.
3045 2018-12-28 18:38:39 Good cause I used the butter to oil my chest
3046 2018-12-28 18:38:17 Excepting a short-term run of a second-choice PTO, all the good Oilers attackers were also inherited by Chiarelli. So, any mention of the Oilers need for depth scoring also has that subtext of managerial  incompetence.

Really, as does *any* intelligent commentary on the Oil.
3047 2018-12-28 18:38:10  cut out
3048 2018-12-28 18:37:44 Nothing hey. Well baby oil but not always coz it makes her hair stiff. Other than that, I just use baby shampoo.
3049 2018-12-28 18:37:33 if you ever see my eyelashes wet it's either from crying or coconut oil
3050 2018-12-28 18:37:32 If you have oil well then you can marry more than one. Indian Muslims can't afford more than one wife. I support people who marry more than one wife If they are rich enough to provide provisions to all wives.

3053 2018-12-28 18:37:21 I need to go in get my oil changed & a car wash but I don’t feel like moving
3054 2018-12-28 18:37:18 So did halo not work? I’m on prescribed medicine and I want to stop taking it so I need something that works. I’ve done a lot of research on stuff. I’ve also heard that rosehip oil is good to put on your face.
3055 2018-12-28 18:37:16 Hello ladies please do you use essential oils for face moisturizer? And if you do which and does it help with oil control?
3056 2018-12-28 18:37:12 That he took money from individuals that happen to be employed by oil and gas companies? In Texas? Do you agree with every single political position held by your employer, Arthur?
3057 2018-12-28 18:37:06 You need to accept the fact that pipelines are opposed in North America period. Stop whining: the central point of the article which you don't get! the oil/mining/gas industry can outspend NGOs 100 to 1!
3058 2018-12-28 18:37:05 Infinity War, Oil Change, Escape room today, hopefully all that can get done

3060 2018-12-28 18:36:54 All lunches are postponed until my oil is done .
3061 2018-12-28 18:36:49 You are wrong, oil is not exclusively priced in $ anymore, can’t you read. Deficits cannot grow forever without consequences. A currency has to be backed by economic output to be worth anything. US global gdp has been declining for decades and will eventually be a third world.
3062 2018-12-28 18:36:38 My first dish in the 12 today was flash fried Brussels sprouts. Ooh La La. I thought the coconut oil would be great for getting the cast iron all happy!
3063 2018-12-28 18:36:37 How about you show me YOUR paperwork and I need some oil, 5w30 will do.

3065 2018-12-28 18:36:34 Why is this oil change high ?  I don’t want to be an adult anymore !!
3066 2018-12-28 18:36:26 Gnezdovo tarsoly. Vegetable tanned cowhide oiled with pure neatsfoot oil. Bronze replica hardware, cast in Ukraine. Historical size.

3067 2018-12-28 18:36:11 "Oil and Natural Gas production at all-time high"

Not understanding this is bad is peak Obama-style liberalism
3068 2018-12-28 18:36:00 I don't believe you.
You lie too much for me to trust anything you say.
I think you secretly want Scottish independence. You do, don't you? Go on, admit it. Think of the oil, the energy resources, the new financial markets... you want it... mmm...
3069 2018-12-28 18:35:59 I know it’s in my best interest to get my oil changed and get a haircut today. But like. I’m lazy.
3070 2018-12-28 18:35:58 Just grow your own weed and make your own Cannabis infused drinks, CBD oil, Cannabutter ....  it’s easy. Stay stoned. Free weed.... No worries... no problems....
3071 2018-12-28 18:35:57 Lot of HAZMAT to contain? All that contaminated water used to fight fire mixed with oil.

3074 2018-12-28 18:35:48 yeah i have!! ive actually just been taking evening primrose oil supplements and it seems to be helping and i also just ordered a face cream from a place called curology that seems to help alot of people

3076 2018-12-28 18:35:38 The Elder Child got me a sweet pair of work boots for Xmas, and I just took inordinate pleasure in rubbing them down with mink oil
3077 2018-12-28 18:35:36 Me too! Phone banked, gave lots of $$$, etc. I was YUUUGELY disappointed. All Obama’s got is a great smile and a back pocket full of oil/gas/WallSt money. Hence: #Bernie2020 Nobody else can beat the Orange Nightmare
3078 2018-12-28 18:35:34 No not behind a computer, I'm a business and economic major, we dont need to compete with Visa we need to compete with gold, oil and other commodities. Visa isnt a buggy man they are a very effiecent payment platform that works, is trusted and is insured.
3079 2018-12-28 18:35:30 寝れねー
3080 2018-12-28 18:35:16 Oil and gasoline is down. This Democrats will tax more. Dumb and Easter your hard earned money to freebies.
3081 2018-12-28 18:35:14 So an oil change, and a lightbulb replacement has now turned into transmission fluid leak, rear coil replacement. $50.00 has now turned into $ 1400.00
3082 2018-12-28 18:35:09 
3083 2018-12-28 18:35:03 More like hot water coconut oil and tea tree oil lool
3084 2018-12-28 18:34:55 I can still see you believe that they have your best interest in mind.. other donors, oil tycoon who does not want marijuana legalized as the 1st model T ran on clean hemp fuel and it will devastate his profits in the oil business, big tobacco and alcohol + big pharmaceutical
3085 2018-12-28 18:34:54 @BetoORourke isn't as great as we thought. He has taken LARGE amounts of "donations" from big oil/gas. He has also switched his thoughts on single payer health care.
3086 2018-12-28 18:34:50 Sell me out to oil, empower billionaires, give me shit healthcare, dont improve my living conditions I DONT CARE just  BE A DEMOCRAT PLEASE
3087 2018-12-28 18:34:45 Nothing just my 10K oil change and there was a recall
3088 2018-12-28 18:34:40 so now we know brendon smells like car oil, tobacco and soap 
3089 2018-12-28 18:34:33 Malik sahib! My statement is on the basis of Remote Sensing.there are bright chances of discovery of both Oil  & Gas.Let us wait & see
3090 2018-12-28 18:34:32 Yeah, it's almost as if a lot of money went to the O'Rourke campaign from Texas, where he was running, and where oil and gas companies are some of the state's top employers. SHOCKING.
3091 2018-12-28 18:34:31 Exodus 27:20 KJV"Just as the light shined always. The light of the world, Jesus shines always. The oil that burns is the Holy Spirit, purifying our hearts."
3092 2018-12-28 18:34:23 Does no one sell oil carts in jax Why is this so hard 
3093 2018-12-28 18:34:19 He who pays the Piper oil subsidy and monopoly of strategic  resources dictate the tunes. Dangote and Otedola are beneficiary's of our collective commonweath. So APC signing them on to an already defeated squad just made it worse. Men are "AGIP".
3094 2018-12-28 18:34:17 Nails par neem oil Laga lo, definitely work karega
3095 2018-12-28 18:34:09 InfoChip's #RFID products are ideal for industries like oil & gas, rigging, lifting, mining, aerospace, construction, & rental companies.

3099 2018-12-28 18:33:53 Things overheard during the Holidays: “Oregano oil cures everything” 
3100 2018-12-28 18:33:53 But everyone’s hair is different. So there’s no way the same thing works for all hair. I spray water mixed with some that Africa’s Pride oil, then just put a little of the Africa’s pride solo and then that Cantu curling cream and I’m out. I also don’t use that sulfate fee crap.
3101 2018-12-28 18:33:51 What is America planning on doing about Russia taking over Venezuela's oil Reserves and companies.
Is this not a violation of the hemisphere treaty?
Is that not why we bought Alaska?
So they could stay on their playground and the us could stay on our playground.
3102 2018-12-28 18:33:49 Faldt lige over dette. Det lyder ikke godt: While it's not a given that Weatherford will go bankrupt, the reality is, this is a debt-laden company that hasn't generated positive cash flows from its business operations in essentially two years. Factor in the uncertainty in the oil
3103 2018-12-28 18:33:40 I got my oil changed today I feel good about that. 
3104 2018-12-28 18:33:36 If you want that tell Hollywood to stop remaking movies.
3105 2018-12-28 18:33:14 Or olive oil
3106 2018-12-28 18:33:06 I’d say no, but he’s got numbers.
3107 2018-12-28 18:33:02 Ok then, I guess even though his policy towards that industry and basically every other aspect alignes with my views I need to condemn him for that $3000. So I now cannot support anyone from any party because they may all have recieved more than $0 from oil employees....

BJP govt under PM Modi has inaugurated the Paradip Oil Refinery & laid the foundation of Paradip- Hyderabad pipeline of Indian Oil Corp which will not only strengthen Odisha’s energy sector but will also boost employment & investment in the region

3113 2018-12-28 18:32:31 I'm a flames fan and I like seeing the oil suffer but how on god's green earth does he still have a job up there?
3114 2018-12-28 18:32:17 I use the oil when I can't sleep or when my anxiety goes through the roof and it works really well! Unfortunately, it's not in capsule form. Couple drops under the tongue and I'm good. Except that the oil tastes like damp cardboard after the lawn's been mowed.
3115 2018-12-28 18:32:17 Taking money from oil companies? Hey, Eddie? The day you or any other self important socialist has the fkn nerve to think they can tell me that I can't donate to the candidate of my choice because of who I work for is the day you're insignificance has rendered you useless.
3116 2018-12-28 18:32:15 このルートが見えていた（心眼）
3117 2018-12-28 18:32:14 Well, I still don’t think he’s Hall Worhy, but to below 15% w his numbers (especially as a 2B) is a little odd, I’ll agree.
3118 2018-12-28 18:32:02 Unless you’re driving your vehicle 3000 miles or more in the 3 months you don’t need one. Dealerships are notorious for scamming on the oil changes. An oil change should last minimum of 3000 miles
3119 2018-12-28 18:31:59 狙った（嘘）
3120 2018-12-28 18:31:56 Bernouts love to create a distorted narrative on someone and then just repeat it forever as if it is the 100% honest truth.
"Beto is in the pocket of Big Oil" is the new "Hillary was a Goldwater girl" for these goobers.
3121 2018-12-28 18:31:54 Oil of you getting fucked lmao.
3122 2018-12-28 18:31:54 I have an unhealthy obsession with essential oil diffusers, candles, lotion, cologne, shower products, and skincare.  I can never get enough it’s a problem
3123 2018-12-28 18:31:49 Gals/guys, poundland are selling eucalyptus and lavender bath oil that I swear is perfect for sprinkling on your pillow at night. They're a quid - treat yourself.
3124 2018-12-28 18:31:41 Theory is nice but structural trade imbalances are real. Look at historical restrictions of oil and gas investments into Mexico.
3125 2018-12-28 18:31:40 Self-loathing white people could teach IMAX a thing or two about projection

3128 2018-12-28 18:31:35 You'll buy the whole olive oil popcorn! but you'll only need the EDGE!
3129 2018-12-28 18:31:31 They are lower everywhere because of oil economics not because of you or your policies of stupidity.

3131 2018-12-28 18:31:27 Does Israel do anything for America..Do they have any kind of industry? What do we buy from them? I never see anything marked made in Israel...We give them all the oil from Alaska & a huge welfare ck.    But do they do anything but war? I am just curious...

3134 2018-12-28 18:31:19 That should do wonders for the Texas economy. 

Good thing oil prices aren't falling.... oh, wait.
3135 2018-12-28 18:31:15 buti na lang di pa ko naglagay ng castor oil kundi tunaw na yun ngayon
3136 2018-12-28 18:31:07 Sort of- I like to use the shelf paper that is sticky on one side and vinyl on the other. Then it stays put and is much easier to wipe down than straight wood. I line my cupboards where the oil goes with paper towel in addition.
3137 2018-12-28 18:30:54 Ford, let's not take credit for the dropping oil price.
3138 2018-12-28 18:30:44 Interesting - why canola oil for the tomatoes instead of more olive oil?
3139 2018-12-28 18:30:35 @JoeVargas what made you turn to the CBD oil Industry? I’m interested in the Cannabis field.
3140 2018-12-28 18:30:30 Love this, however the statement from @Reuters that the North is a forgotten region is just wrong. Our political space & govt offices are flooded wt Northerners. Major private oil wells r owned by Northerners, etc. The North is not developed bcos the elite few enjoy it that way.
3141 2018-12-28 18:30:27 We allowed criminals in the WH to get away - big mistake. Great uncertainty and lack of confidence. Oil embargo, Iran hostages, NYC bankruptcy, residual racial tension from 60's, Cold War. Terrible taste in fashion. Rampant crime in NYC & elsewhere. We're much better off now.
3142 2018-12-28 18:30:21 I don’t buy into “busy” as that seems like a sunk costs rationalization and burnout to me. The huge container push they were getting all so excited about was proven to be snake oil and they are stuck with it. Now seeing bait-n-switch with “serverless”.
3143 2018-12-28 18:30:12 What if I told you an oil executive's son, who became a fat cat investment banker, bought the most grassroots team, in a blue-collar town, in a sport that everyone said didn't have any fans, and he bought it from the family of the father of the sport in that country.
3144 2018-12-28 18:30:11 He's Fine Gael, what else do you expect? He's only interested in you if you're a good little consumer propping up the insurance, motor and oil industries
3145 2018-12-28 18:30:07 Control of the oil $$$ by the Central Bank? 
3146 2018-12-28 18:30:04 OIL is going to 39$ by Valentine Day.
3147 2018-12-28 18:30:03 What about @BetoORourke voting record? Does he favor the working class or bank deregulations and big oil companies?
3148 2018-12-28 18:30:02 Climate leadership is ending the age of oil. #climateleadershipis
3149 2018-12-28 18:30:00 During thatcher years national debt went from 48% of GDP down to 25% of GDP paid for largely by receipts of North Sea oil. It went from 45% to 90% during the last labour government, yes to bailout the banks. Tribal politics won’t help.
3150 2018-12-28 18:29:57 That backs up what I said about the oil crisis. Reference to miners was Tory propaganda as we had ample supplies of coal stockpiled. Like austerity this was an idealogical choice. Brown has been lauded universally for his astute handling of the world economic crisis. Wikipedia

3155 2018-12-28 18:29:36 Chain oil makes nice purple smoke FYI
3156 2018-12-28 18:29:34 Engine oil I hope um not dirty minded 
3157 2018-12-28 18:29:31 Umm it's by design. American now wants a ME war to drive up their oil prices. Putin getting jammed up with Turkey, Syria, and Israel is a bonus. 

Times are a-changing.
3158 2018-12-28 18:29:31 Please say more about the article’s main point: “One, accept that eco-activists (whatever their nationality)...have a right to oppose oil sands development.” What *right* does an American have to dabble in Canadian politics? Please be specific—I’ll wait.

3161 2018-12-28 18:29:16 Lol right, there is no elitist attack on Beto. When they found out he is open to taking oil and gas money they rubbed themselves all over him.
3162 2018-12-28 18:29:14 Maybe try some tea tree oil and a cold press?
3163 2018-12-28 18:29:13 use coconut oil x
3164 2018-12-28 18:29:05 Ya I work in the oil patch in Canada , 21 days on 5 days off . 12 hour days . So ya I have a pretty good job but home for the holidays . Merry Christmas
3165 2018-12-28 18:29:05 i’m at the dealership getting my oil checked and the guy that took my key had to get someone else to move my jeep bc he doesn’t know how to drive standard
3166 2018-12-28 18:29:05 Tea tree oil
3167 2018-12-28 18:29:02 Is it more environmentally friendly than Canada's oil? Do I need to repeat how much GHG we would save from being emitted if OPEC produced to same Can. Standards? I since when did environmentalists care about oil economics? Makes me laugh hearing that as their arguement.
3168 2018-12-28 18:28:58 Turkey is the legitimate guaranteer of security the area, and is more than capable of defeating ISIS— unlike the Mossad controlled communist terroriST YPG/PKK funded BY US dollars focused first and foremost on its drug operations, protection rackets, and selling oil to Assad.
3169 2018-12-28 18:28:57 FYI. Oil futures prices quoted b4 are for February.
3170 2018-12-28 18:28:53 bros were the problem, but who think that Medicare for all is the only possible answer, that attacking oil co profits is a better approach to climate change than cap and trade, that the US should dramatically ramp down its global posture.  But I don't know any.
3171 2018-12-28 18:28:48 Which essential oil will make you shut the fuck up
3172 2018-12-28 18:28:44 essential oil diffusers are the salt lamps of 2019 but instead of licking them we’re just putting our heads directly on top of them for maximum smelling accessibility
3173 2018-12-28 18:28:43 Noted! Although I was thinking of inviting Boris Johnson, surely a couple of litres of own brand vegetable oil would be good enough to tip over him? If I heated it to pretty near boiling? His hair wouldn't be looking so floppy after that.
3174 2018-12-28 18:28:36 Realizing I'll be ostracized for pointing this out, but, the rear wheel is dangerously close to his ass. Furthermore, all the road dirt, oil and filth is thrown down his back as he cruises. It's an obvious triumph of leftist engineering.

3180 2018-12-28 18:28:11 A free oil change...look at God
3181 2018-12-28 18:28:11 Does the app allow me to add oil on the fly from the drivers seat?
3182 2018-12-28 18:28:00 WOW mk. 1) Pretty sure her idea that the US has the right 2 “take the oil” from countries we invade as payment causes more harm than her being publicly humiliated 4 such rightwing views.
2) You mean the rules that say a primary must b fair but that the DNC isn’t legally bound by?
3183 2018-12-28 18:28:00 What if I can show you a PURE hemp oil?

3185 2018-12-28 18:27:57 American oil production exploded during Obama’s presidency. He was no environmentalist.
3186 2018-12-28 18:27:56 Okay not awful I guess  I’m getting an oil change rn, but after I’m just going to quicksell my 11 Desmond Kings and open the NAT GoM present for him
3187 2018-12-28 18:27:52 I'm blaming him and his government for not getting our product to the global markets.  I'm blaming him for pushing away investors with taxes.  I'm blaming him for importing oil from countries with less than stellar human rights records.  I'm blaming him for creating divide.
3188 2018-12-28 18:27:41 Synthetic oil 
3189 2018-12-28 18:27:35 Yes. It’s not hard fr. You just basically make weed cooking oil and bake it into something.
3190 2018-12-28 18:27:29 All the very best go get the oil. Time for South Asia to get rich.
3191 2018-12-28 18:27:25 Can that essential oil cure your lack of a personality
3192 2018-12-28 18:27:23 Proper appreciate whenever anyone gets me a bath bomb from LUSH bc I know full well they got harassed to fuck by the staff and ended up getting smeared in Eucelpytas lip scrub infused with tea tree oil and the snow of Everest’s highest peak when they bought it 
3193 2018-12-28 18:27:11 And Nigeria is still locked down with oil. Instead of radical investment in knowledge based education, we are groping in obsoletes. No thanks to visionless leadership
3194 2018-12-28 18:27:00 vitamin E oil gave me the Bruce Leroy glow.
3195 2018-12-28 18:26:56 Today, I'm still fudging around with this 9 x 12 oil on canvas. Adjusting values and colors, shadow and light.
3196 2018-12-28 18:26:47 Sitting at @mrlube_medhat getting my oil changed and overheard a passionate conversation about pipelines, getting rid of the NDP and how proud people are of the 2000+ person @rally4resources rally that came together last weekend. 

I am so excited for 2019. #ableg
3197 2018-12-28 18:26:46 Hey, I’m turning over a new leaf after chatting to you. I’m off to clear all my cupboards of everything with palm oil - it’s everywhere. Don’t want to be accused of just making a gesture to look good! :-)
3198 2018-12-28 18:26:39 I did my first detox on a vacation week where I stayed in doors and away from ppl. I couldn't stand the smell of myself. Made it through and used baking soda + coconut oil, big mistake. I had to mix the right amount of cornstarch, arrowroot, beeswax and shea for protection
3199 2018-12-28 18:26:37 I've heard good things about sulfate-free shampoo. Sodium lauryl (or laureth) sulfate is just a foaming agent that doesn't clean your hair but *does* dissolve the oil that naturally coats it. Your follicles compensate by over producing and voila- grease central.
3200 2018-12-28 18:26:31 Burning oil all the way
3201 2018-12-28 18:26:30 Why not just engage the oil slick?
3202 2018-12-28 18:26:29 Interesting how you accuse me of bias by posting a meme that is quite obviously biased and follows an agenda.  If you do not like the "obscene" profits that oil companies are making then stop buying anything made or that uses their product. Don't be a hypocrite.
3203 2018-12-28 18:26:21 Not buyying it, stealing it. They leading the war in France. So they get 85% of Oil from there
3204 2018-12-28 18:26:11 The far left is the ONLY ones in office trying to do something about climate change, centrist dems are taking big oil money
3205 2018-12-28 18:26:09 olive oil cholesterol. like a hair mask type shit.
3206 2018-12-28 18:25:57 If you don't know why our heavy oil is selling at a much less price than other heavy oil blends from Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, please inform yourself and use Google. It's your friend.
3207 2018-12-28 18:25:57 CBD oil is unregulated and filled with chemicals. I tried so many brands, until someone in the industry admitted to  me that there no such thing as "organic" CBD bc of how it is processed. I have concerns. (But I'm just the canary in the coal mine. Don't listen to me.)
3208 2018-12-28 18:25:51 Ok I’m finna get a oil change right here by you I’ll get you when  I’m done
3209 2018-12-28 18:25:48 Please act swiftly & forcibly, to reverse climate change, stop the killing of our wildlife, move more people away from factory farming... and palm oil.
3210 2018-12-28 18:25:45 Yes Levittown twin. Winter of 1993 ! was fucking crazy. I was the 1st one to break into to. climbed in the oil burner vent and came out in the womens bathroom. all electricity still work even the pay phone could make and receive calls.
3211 2018-12-28 18:25:39 Lol. Wrong for @Reuters to say that! The political space is dominated by Northerners. Most private oil wells are owned by Northerners. Govt offices are flooded with Northerners. The few who are educated and opportuned have refused to build their region. It was never forgotten!
3212 2018-12-28 18:25:39 Baby; if you have thick hair , get u a thick leave in, olive oil, spray bottle; and depending on how thick you hair is a hair butter or some hair milk. You can literally use these products for any style.

 The report of the Economist Information Unit entitled "Iran on the Edge of the Blade" examines the implications of the return of sanctions on political and geopolitical issues in the Middle East, the oil market and economics and politics in Iran.

3216 2018-12-28 18:25:13 No, George W. Should never have attacked Iraq. Cheney told him to go. It was out of greed and for oil. John Bolton was very probably involved.

3223 2018-12-28 18:24:39 I've been at the dealership now for 2hrs

Is this free oil change really worth it?
3224 2018-12-28 18:24:26 Hmmm. Now who would benefit from that tactic? Anyone? Anyone? (surely not the entrenched political media nuclear oil pharma military industrial complex right?)
3225 2018-12-28 18:24:26 Shit my oil change is my fault I drive too much, but every car conveniently fucks up all at once. Especially when you get extra bread lls
3226 2018-12-28 18:24:14 Seriously can you still not see Presidents have directives from their contributors & before you know it their agenda is not theirs it's the oil lobbyist or the pharma lobbyist or Monsanto. It's not about,what's right it's about what's profitable.

3229 2018-12-28 18:24:06 Gas prices this low is actually bad for the Canadian economy as it means oil is low. billions lost and hundreds if not 1000s of out of work. But let's cheer it on because it doesn't negatively impact me personally. You had no impact on this you can actually thank the liberals
3230 2018-12-28 18:24:01 Sure, FDR was great. And if you were alive & had social media back then, many of you would have been (H) Wallace-ites complaining about how horrible he was to blacks, Japanese, cutting deals with Saudis for oil, and in general asking why FDR is such a sellout. Just admit it!
3231 2018-12-28 18:23:56 Because Clark was made to be so limited by his father and the whole being found out thing, Clark clearly hasn’t had developed his powers noting his strain to how the oil rig vs pushing back the gravity beam.

When his father died he was 18 so he still had that young man mentality
3232 2018-12-28 18:23:43 I don't want to sound condescending but there are quite a few options available to Macron and Merkel. 

-disconect Russia from SWIFT
-increase economic sanctions 
-gradualy stop buying Russian gas and oil  
-seize assets of Putin and his cronies, revoke their Western visas
3233 2018-12-28 18:23:43 The stranglehold of the @gop aligning with the rickety oil and coal barrons is keeping us from moving leaps and bounds forward with innovation.

3245 2018-12-28 18:22:45 Please be open and honest about your decision to knowingly build an engine that will consume (burn) oil.  Customers should know that you consider a quart of oil consumed every 1000-1500 miles is an “acceptable” level of “oil consumption”.

3248 2018-12-28 18:22:40 So how many percent growth is $17/barrel to $60/barrel under OBJ?Please was OBJ suppose to complain about such an astronomical boom in crude oil price/revenues? Crude Oil revenues make up almost 90% of the Nations earnings...You can’t compare that with what PMB met?
3249 2018-12-28 18:22:38 Yes but the numbers speak for themselves, it's so silly
3250 2018-12-28 18:22:38 Sirota's attack was based on pretending anyone who gets donations from oilfield workers and gas station attendants is in Big Oil's pocket.

By that standard which you embrace, Bernie Sanders himself is in Big Oil's pocket.
3251 2018-12-28 18:22:30 and I am no longer
afraid of anything, save
the life that, here, awaits.
I don't belong to anyone.
My heart is heavy as an oil drum.
I don't want to be alone.
My heart is yellow as an ear of corn,
and I have torn my soul apart, from
pulling artlessly with fool commands.

3259 2018-12-28 18:21:31 Though I can't see him getting in any time soon via the veterans vote, for reasons you mentioned, the likes of McGriff, Sheffield, Walker, Whitaker will. What do you think of Berkman as a candidate?
3260 2018-12-28 18:21:16 I actually bought a copy of that issue off eBay. The article rambles on about his pseudoscientific "animal fats will kill you." The adjacent page is an add for corn oil that shows the corn magically transforming into margarine, and the back is an ad for Marlboros.
3261 2018-12-28 18:20:59 I'm wondering what's his weakness. I could only think of 1 thing. Frying oil

3265 2018-12-28 18:20:35 So you need an oil change
3266 2018-12-28 18:20:34 Liberal or PC. Oil prices dropped.  Nothing to do with Doug. If you believe that you have been fooled by Doug.  Doug doesn't influence American gas prices..lol.
3267 2018-12-28 18:20:31 CBD oil: Confirmed can cure death.
3268 2018-12-28 18:20:28 Yes I had read about this but the electric central heating is so expensive and no gas up here.Nowhere to put an oil tank (we've asked) and not prepared to freeze to death, waiting for electricity to become cheap from wind farms?
3269 2018-12-28 18:20:26 Oil and gas companies have known this was coming for 40 years, and now that it's on their doorstep they want to complain that it's all happening too fast.

They HID climate reports that proved they knew they were causing damage and now we're supposed to give them 20 more years?
3270 2018-12-28 18:20:24 Very cool: "hair slicked back with enough oil to lube a bone-dry Buick transmission."
3271 2018-12-28 18:20:24 Pipelines to tidewater will increase access to international customers where the oil may be sold at international rates instead of the deep discounts given to the US.
3272 2018-12-28 18:20:20 The biggest challenge facing Kenya is ignorance exhibited by the poor! You are irredeemably useless! He is not being arrested for a show, he is being arrested for the millions of shillings he laundered!

3277 2018-12-28 18:20:06 If APC like let them appoint Bill Gate in their campaign team. They will still LOOSE.

We will use Dangote's truck to load him back to Daura and use Otedola's Forte oil to fuel the truck.

3278 2018-12-28 18:19:58 You are right about involvement of PUK & PDK of smuggling Kurdistan oil  BUT be careful you are too wrong IF you believe even if we give all oil to Iraq they would send our percentage correctly or without any problem , if you think so this is called young thought and inexperience
3279 2018-12-28 18:19:54 Getting my oil changed stresses me out 
3280 2018-12-28 18:19:51 Sorry. I didn't mean to imply @cbouzy had a problem w/Beto. Until I learned of the large amount of money Beto has accepted from big oil and gas, I didn't have a problem with him. To be clear, my very big problem with Beto is the rather large amount of oil & gas $$$ he's accepted.
3281 2018-12-28 18:19:36 leave a can of 3-in-1 oil as a tip?
3282 2018-12-28 18:19:35 Whilst majority of Quebec people want western Canada oil

3284 2018-12-28 18:19:30 That makes absolutely no sense, none. 

Ever since the oil shocks and high interest rates of Reagan time, the fed has kept inflation very low. It is still relatively very low, it's slightly higher than the norm, but not much. Wages haven't pace with inflation for last 40 years.
3285 2018-12-28 18:19:27 Out come of PMLN Future policies have start coming ..ExxonMobil have had signed oil searching agreements with Pakistan in PMLN tenure ..We appreciate Current Government to take 2025 Vision fwd .
3286 2018-12-28 18:19:19 Wishing oil companies go broke is the dumb statement and not a smart thing to say
3287 2018-12-28 18:19:19 jace took my car to work to clean it today and he ended up changing my oil for me and filling my tank up what did i do to deserve him
3288 2018-12-28 18:19:09 

Be sure to use single estate 
cold-pressed extra-virgin olive oil: or you’ll get complaints!
3289 2018-12-28 18:19:08 I would think 'oil/gas industry campaign cash' should include PAC money too no?
3290 2018-12-28 18:19:07 Like... do you run public awareness campaigns like the NDP is currently doing? Do you ban foreign donations to organizations *specific* to oil? And if you do that, how does that fit with free speech laws? That was the problem the NDP had with PACs and the election act.

3294 2018-12-28 18:18:42 I'm waiting for an oil change and listening to this guy's sales pitch steamrolling this couple. I never want to buy another car again. I have anxiety just listening to this.
3295 2018-12-28 18:18:39 i wonder how many hours of my life i’ve wasted waiting for a oil change
3296 2018-12-28 18:18:35 I wonder if gas prices are going down because they found oil in Guyana
3297 2018-12-28 18:18:35 With wires you have to contend with loss and electrical noise. The wires would have to be thousands of feet. These are systems placed on drill stems, much like those in the oil industry.

3302 2018-12-28 18:18:13 If you try it and use coconut oil, warm it up to it liquifies then pull. The texture of it solid can be gagging
3303 2018-12-28 18:18:04 Jars go unopened, spiders thrive, very few oil changes.
3304 2018-12-28 18:18:02 My advice, as always:

Change. The. Channel.

Everyone wins.
3305 2018-12-28 18:18:00 Doing a lot of holiday driving this week? Make sure your vehicle is in good repair. Check your oil, tires and emergency kit before you head over the river and through the woods.
3306 2018-12-28 18:17:57 COCO OIL FIRST
3307 2018-12-28 18:17:56 Should probably get a oil change. Probably won’t 
3308 2018-12-28 18:17:55 So my dumb ass didn’t wanna go to the dealership to get a oil change, so I’m at 5 min bitch 79.99 & I be paying 50 dollars even
3309 2018-12-28 18:17:27 I need to go get an oil change but I don’t feel like going to do it

3311 2018-12-28 18:17:23 Raw shea butter and coconut oil have done wonders to my little fro .
3312 2018-12-28 18:17:17 Okay, seriously, is this account a good? How could you be this out of touch with reality to think this campaign would work to convince people oil companies are in the right?
3313 2018-12-28 18:17:14 You can do it at home with coconut (most popular), grapeseed, sunflower, walnut oil. Oil pull like you use mouth wash. Put it in your mouth and swish swish swish, spit in cup or trash. Try to do for 20 mins a few times a week. Its not easy but it will when you get the hang of it
3314 2018-12-28 18:17:07 That appears to be the case. The US has a number of ports they can use to ship their oil to world markets from for a better price than they pay for ours. I’ve heard some of our oil is simply resold but don’t have numbers to back that claim.
3315 2018-12-28 18:17:05 Washing dishes helps.
The heat, the water, the noise, and the exercise do something.

Taking a hot bath helps. Just don't have a coronary.

Lavender oil is supposed to help. I recommend using bubble bath.

Holding a cat/pillow in your lap/arms while watching TV helps a little.

3318 2018-12-28 18:16:57 It’s also to do with the boot on the neck of Alberta oil to export.
3319 2018-12-28 18:16:55 What about those people in the military lady and the vets on the street with PTSD. You want to go fight put yourself on the line lady. Bring the military  home. The agenda was a Dem takeover of Syria. Read the true history it is all about oil and pipelines and who funded ISIS
3320 2018-12-28 18:16:54 He’s certainly a viable candidate.

3323 2018-12-28 18:16:39 It has a tax. You really believe these snake oil politicians will spend this money appropriately. Trudeau never paid a bill in his life. Please look around you, and not through MSM eyes
3324 2018-12-28 18:16:28 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
3325 2018-12-28 18:16:19 It’s a big world.  Room for all. 

I think they are about the most perfect thing the human species has invented. 

The crunch of a perfectly done crust, followed by the bit of lingering oil, carrying flavor. Then the heat of the chile, and finally the warm cheese.
3326 2018-12-28 18:16:19 Yes, there is that but my thing is he isn't even close. It is rather ridiculous.
3327 2018-12-28 18:16:18 Finally getting my oil changed. I was so tired of looking at that damn alert 
3328 2018-12-28 18:16:17 Home early from work so I’m going use some of the self care stuff my husband got me for xmas and relax. Face mask in and feet in the spa bath with the oil diffuser on. I might just fall asleep lol
3329 2018-12-28 18:16:11 Thank you, but don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
3330 2018-12-28 18:16:04 Eu comemorei a chegada da @Kiehls ao Brasil quando a @diadebeaute anunciou. Acho que isso foi em 2009/10. De lá pra cá usei:

3331 2018-12-28 18:15:58 My secret is Mane Choice growth oil, deep conditioning (I use Shea Moisture's Manuka honey) weekly or every other week, vitamins (especially biotin), and water. I also keep my hands out of my head by wearing protective styles.
3332 2018-12-28 18:15:55 M&S black truffle and olive oil crisps are my new obsession
3333 2018-12-28 18:15:52 You mean the pipeline through ancient rain forest and where the oil company used false maps of the area to show there was no danger?  You are so disingenuous.
3334 2018-12-28 18:15:40 Also has full range of accessories, extender ring, oil spray, air fry baskets etc
3335 2018-12-30 23:59:50 On Fridays they lick the table.
3336 2018-12-30 23:59:43 Am a geologist and believe me when I tell you the world aint think I ng about yo crude no more.... Heard about the us wanting to stop importation from oil rich countries yeah???
3337 2018-12-30 23:59:29 Similar scenario when Obama told us that we couldn’t drill our way out of the oil crisis, well now we lead the world in oil production. Same with the wall, it will work, just build the damn thing.
3338 2018-12-30 23:59:12 my mom asked if i wanted marijuana oil  and then proceeded to hand me a bottle of hemp cooking oil 
3339 2018-12-30 23:58:59 Next questions:
1) do these correlate with fast life and slow life strategies
2) can immigrants' culture be changed, so they fit in? Or are these cultures like oil and water?
3340 2018-12-30 23:58:57 こちらこそお会いできてありがとうございました

3341 2018-12-30 23:58:52 Yes, but in the ratio of the 97% of scientists that agree climate change is real vs. the 3% who aren't sure vs. the handful of unqualified deniers paid by big oil.
3342 2018-12-30 23:58:51 

3343 2018-12-30 23:58:34 It it truly impresssive that Doug Ford has single handedly managed to drive the price of oil down on the global markets: taming OPEC, shaming the Russians, and gaming the Americans. Thank you for making gasoline cheap this year. Less than the buck I pay for my beer. #FordNation
3344 2018-12-30 23:58:23 Does the oil stimulate growth too?
3345 2018-12-30 23:58:21 You should buy pure vitamin E oil, I know an Etsy shop that sells pure Vitamin E oil for a good price. 

Vitamin E oil contains antioxidants that are super helpful getting rid of acne. 

In addition, get tea tree oil. Put 30 drops of it into a small travel spray bottle and the +
3346 2018-12-30 23:58:18 I just took a ginger root & peppermint oil bath ... I feel amazing 
3347 2018-12-30 23:58:13 Doesn't exist... If FFFP ever actually punishes teams then City's trophies since the oil money came in are all fraud. But it won't happen... It's bullshit

3349 2018-12-30 23:57:46 I would fair to guess the oil power plants at best area 60% -70% efficient.
3350 2018-12-30 23:57:43 He drinks the same cool aid as terry jones. Crazy how clueless he is for someone with a good informed gig.  Oilers no better than they were yesterday. If anything worse, lost a player that could score.  I guess more time for lucic to piss us off more
3351 2018-12-30 23:59:50 On Fridays they lick the table.
3352 2018-12-30 23:59:43 Am a geologist and believe me when I tell you the world aint think I ng about yo crude no more.... Heard about the us wanting to stop importation from oil rich countries yeah???
3353 2018-12-30 23:59:29 Similar scenario when Obama told us that we couldn’t drill our way out of the oil crisis, well now we lead the world in oil production. Same with the wall, it will work, just build the damn thing.
3354 2018-12-30 23:59:12 my mom asked if i wanted marijuana oil  and then proceeded to hand me a bottle of hemp cooking oil 
3355 2018-12-30 23:58:59 Next questions:
1) do these correlate with fast life and slow life strategies
2) can immigrants' culture be changed, so they fit in? Or are these cultures like oil and water?

3357 2018-12-30 23:58:52 Yes, but in the ratio of the 97% of scientists that agree climate change is real vs. the 3% who aren't sure vs. the handful of unqualified deniers paid by big oil.

3367 2018-12-30 23:57:36 i dont want cbd oil. i want CBT oil (cock and ball torture oil)
3368 2018-12-30 23:57:31 
3369 2018-12-30 23:57:28 Ergghhhhh I keep seeing people who never left my home town talk about CBD oil like it's edgy. 

I have yet to regret leaving that place.
3370 2018-12-30 23:57:16 I am I'm inspired by you who made some of the richest people in the countries 401ks went up and producing more oil while looking down the barrel at climate change. That's how I want to be remembered.
3371 2018-12-30 23:57:15 What happens if you get Olbas Oil in your eye? Asking for a mate like
3372 2018-12-30 23:57:11 My Car Was Buggin’ So I Checked The Oil Change Sticker And Of Course She Needs One . I’m Gonna Take My Baby Tomorrow
3373 2018-12-30 23:57:03 Ban Palm Oil damn it
3374 2018-12-30 23:56:40 Crude Oil prices steadied Friday after a week of volatile trading ahead of the New Year holiday, supported by a rise in US equity markets but pressured by worries about a global glut of Crude Oil $OIL
3375 2018-12-30 23:56:36 The radio pundits, who know their stuff, says the #Oilers lost to the Sharks because they lack depth against one of the #NHL's best. Yet 2 years ago, the Oil beat the Sharks in the playoffs. If SJ has gone one way and the Oil the other, that's not on the coach, not on any coach.
3376 2018-12-30 23:56:32 He had legitimate reasons for the blames, There was really nothing much he could have done in the circumstances. We are running a monolithic econs meaning our country is at the behest of crude oil pricing, without enough room for maneuvering. We were bound to crash but we survive
3377 2018-12-30 23:56:06 Sorry you're not feeling well! Lots of lemon with tea & also try roasted garlic. Cut top off head of garlic put a little olive oil on the top wrap in foil & cook in oven for about 3/4 to 1 hour then unwrap it should be brown. Squeeze out cloves & add to scrambled eggs.
3378 2018-12-30 23:56:01 I used his beard oil when I wrapped my hair last night....thats OUR oil now
3379 2018-12-30 23:55:37 just like a song in my heart 
,just like oil on my hands
3380 2018-12-30 23:55:35 We use unleaded gas because science proved the lead we were pumping into the air was killing us, the environment and polluting our drinking water. It didn’t kill the oil and gas industry. Climate change won’t either. Accept the science and start working toward a solution.
3381 2018-12-30 23:55:31 The cost of gasoline is controlled by the multi Nationals who have ripped of Canadians ever since going Metric
Fuel costs went from 0.23 cents/ Lt to 0.43 cents, when Oil was $ 50.00/ barrel 
. What's the cost of oil today. Fuel companies are over charging consumers 25-30 cents.
3382 2018-12-30 23:55:30 If truly they set the oil price benchmark higher than the current market price. Plus 70% going to recurrent expenditure? Then it is indeed hopeless.
3383 2018-12-30 23:55:29 Segurou a LTA em R$9,3 né? Acho que é buy com Oil segurando

3388 2018-12-30 23:54:52 - Chose a length that will work for your lifestyle

- Apply nail oil 1 to 2 times a day to keep nail flexible

- Wear waterproof gloves to keep nails dry when you do chores

- Go to a nail shop if your acrylics brake
3389 2018-12-30 23:54:42 When will Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods stop using unsustainable palm oil that destroys the rainforest and orangutans habitats? Become a member of ROUNDTABLE FOR SUSTAINABLE PALM OIL, RSPO. Won’t shop until they do. Hypocrites.
3390 2018-12-30 23:54:13 Imagine being Rudy, ruining his reputation for a snake oil salesman and not even getting paid by the lie.
3391 2018-12-30 23:54:05 Brian, do you have trouble imagining the difference in magnitude of fuel oil required ?

C’mon man, stop being so dishonest.
3392 2018-12-30 23:54:00 Not sure why you are still spending the big oil companies' money putting your unfounded conspiracy theories into my feed but I guess you think negative impressions are better than no impressions.
3393 2018-12-30 23:53:57 and caused the oil crisis that led to.... every war since
3394 2018-12-30 23:53:48 Trump & those in oil, Gas & mining industries. Especially those in the oil industry ( EXXON) who knew climate change was real & happening.
3395 2018-12-30 23:53:45 ZAITUN. I love food when it’s cooked with ZAITUN oil. My wife loves to cook using ZAITUN oil.
3396 2018-12-30 23:53:29 And what's even more of a disaster for radical environmentalists is the fact that using more oil cars, and trucks to transport oil, far more carbon emissions than any pipeline...they now own the TMX pipeline with their own tax $$$.
3397 2018-12-30 23:53:26 Ooooo I've never tried a priming oil!! And I want to!
3398 2018-12-30 23:53:20 Are you NUTS????   A well oil machine???  What planet are you on???   We have a globalist traitor running our country right into the ground in hopes of economic and social collapse, like in Europe.   You better come back to earth.
3399 2018-12-30 23:53:19 Prices were lower in 2016 and 2015 in Jan and Feb, and that was under cap and trade. Don't kid yourself, it's low oil prices, not anything Doug et al. have done.
3400 2018-12-30 23:53:19 How is it that some people can't understand that oil companies, like any prudent corp, engage in political risk mgmt? Sure they'll say nice things about CO2 reductions and carbon tax schemes, but do you think for a second they would put their P&L in jeopardy? #abpoli #cdnpoli
3401 2018-12-30 23:53:00 Just deep condition and castor oil ... the curl will come back
3402 2018-12-30 23:52:50 Home from getting the car worked on.
Issue from last night - valve cap was leaking oil onto the serpentine belt (and possibly onto the gaskets). Valve cap and belt replaced, other stuff waiting for a couple weeks.
And somehow our tires were stupidly low. Also taken care of.
3403 2018-12-30 23:52:49 Honestly I think it was the way he went about it. He came off arrogant and disrespectful to the ones who came before him. Honey catches more bees than motor oil. He came out spewing motor oil. Just my thought. Much love!
3404 2018-12-30 23:52:48 You are a snake oil saleman!
3405 2018-12-30 23:52:42 How rude of my car to need gas AND a $100 oil change in the same day
3406 2018-12-30 23:52:35 Holy shit that’s real fuckin good! I used to be into the oil painting a little bit too. I also like the detail you put into your vines. Those are vines, right? My bad if they’re not.
3407 2018-12-30 23:52:24 The narrow minded accusation is because of the opposition to just the oil industry and not all the other industries that cause harm. I would assume that one who is opposed to oil is supportive of alternative energy sources.  Also a major source of revenue.
3408 2018-12-30 23:52:23 The only form of healing these fake woke "wombman" ass niggas know is carrying crystals and lighting sage..and when they look at my bestfriend all they think about is head wraps and tea tree oil..cause they dont know her..and because of ignorance..sorry NOT YOUR QUEEN BITCH!
3409 2018-12-30 23:52:22 Oooh. On the presumption that 'olive' is shorthand for olive oil, yum! Perhaps I should make one too, so I can munch in solidarity. I think I have most or all of the pieces here.
3410 2018-12-30 23:52:21 There's a growing movement against the palm oil used in chocolate, because of the environmental damage it does to the countries where it's grown in large plantations, to the detriment of the local wildlife, such as the endangered orang-utan.
3411 2018-12-30 23:52:12 Common Sense Policy Roundtable is making the rounds as a promoted ad in Colorado. They sound so friendly! They are sponsored by Colorado GOP and oil companies that promote fracking. Coloradoans are fighting oil companies to prevent fracking. @CSPRColorado is a propaganda machine.
3412 2018-12-30 23:52:06 Who do I talk to to commission this style of guide pictures, but with the chicken being dunked in egg, flour, and hot oil?
3413 2018-12-30 23:52:05 Dry brushing and  applying gerinium or juniperberry oil. Both oils are found at Dischem. I was very consistent. Took over 6 months to see the difference!
3414 2018-12-30 23:52:00 @CNN and @realDonaldTrump are like oil and water.
3415 2018-12-30 23:51:57 He leads more by symbolic gestures than consistent policy...remind you of any presidents you know? He is a hypocrite when it comes to oil, and he is a scumbag for leading the effort to repeal inverse condemnation laws, which would allow fire victims to be victimized twice.
3416 2018-12-30 23:51:56 It takes 12 pounds of flowers to make enough oil for ONE cancer patient for one year so if one grows only outdoor, that’s the whole years medicine. It takes nearly six pounds of hashish to make one years Chrism oil that gets distributed to ALL the churches. Judge not! We serve!
3417 2018-12-30 23:51:37 Guyana makes some sense in that oil and gas resources have been discovered there and Venezuela has been making demands on it's territory. And well, we all know what dictators with failing economies and rebellious populace like to do to win support.
3418 2018-12-30 23:51:24 We trust him He is our hero in Saudi Arabia  god bless him he will make our country better and create new money  sources not only depend on oil I am sure about that

3419 2018-12-30 23:51:22 Looks like all of @fordnation's lackies got their marching orders to pump the lie lower gas prices are due to the elimination of a nonexistent carbon tax. Does this mean they'll accept the blame when oil recovers from this slump and prices go back up again?
3420 2018-12-30 23:51:00 Attempt to expand it with purchase of TMX. Thank god environmentalists, FN groups have stopped his rampant corporatism.

His love for oil pipelines is no fundamental change from scumbag Cons.
3421 2018-12-30 23:50:47 Eco style Argan oil is the only gel that works for me..
3422 2018-12-30 23:50:44 I’m a Danny! I can emerge from your couch naked lathered in baby oil whenever you want.
3423 2018-12-30 23:50:38 @Kiehls Any idea when Essential Musk Oil will be back in stock? Please don’t let the rumors of discontinuing be true, been wearing it 20 years!
3424 2018-12-30 23:50:28 You didn’t have to cut the gum off u could’ve removed it with olive oil
3425 2018-12-30 23:50:18 おはようございます。年末ジャンボの的（まと）役、緊張してきた。
3426 2018-12-30 23:50:14 Instablocked, as James Woods would say. I’d rather watch oil based paint dry on a muggy day than waste time with an unpatriotic POS anti-American.

3427 2018-12-30 23:50:00 CBD oil is a popular choice amongst athletes. The oil tinctures offer an ease of use, but also a fast onset when it comes to post workout recovery. #cbd #cbdoil #discusscannabis #cannabidiol #Organic #cbdextract #cbdheals #CBDlife #hemp #hempoil #highperformance #recovery

3429 2018-12-30 23:49:57 来年もよろしくです。
お気をつけて！
3430 2018-12-30 23:49:31 I'm sorry for you! Trick for gum peanut butter or mayonnaise! No cutting any oil products actually just a heads up when you have kids lol
3431 2018-12-30 23:49:24 You mean when dictator Mohammed Reza Sha ruled Iran as a puppet of UK and US?   Where the oil wealth of Iran went to western governments and companies?   And after, when they funded Saddam Hussein to destroy Iran at any cost?

3433 2018-12-30 23:49:18 It all depends on what works for you though. I use the Amazon best seller products when you type in "beard oil" or "beard shampoo". I also use argan oil at night after washing my beard every couple of days. Have a look at Beard Baron, I started watching his videos recently
3434 2018-12-30 23:49:16 *rubs scrapes and bruises with oil and wraps it* it’s not a normal day without me needing to do this...*looks over at dresser and opens it and finds a note from Connor and Mom*

3436 2018-12-30 23:49:12 My coworkers girl texted me saying that I had to back off her man like bitch we was just texting about cars. I mean we do work at oil change shop. 
3437 2018-12-30 23:48:58 Solar panels are made with...  Oil
3438 2018-12-30 23:48:34 ps. would like to know which multinational embedded corporations/ certain ruling elites / corrupt religious corporations and pure psychos are filling their ships in international waters again with crude oil? oh yeah... your perceived enemies and your perceived certain allies.
3439 2018-12-30 23:48:21 I use it with the odor reducing oxy because of pets and welder people being in my house. It does a pretty good job but I would really like to do better on the grease and oil.
3440 2018-12-30 23:48:12 Castor oil! If you’re gonna try tea tree oil be careful because it burns
3441 2018-12-30 23:48:08 Maybe make transparent who gets oil and gas money for their 'scientific' studies and then air both sides of the argument.
3442 2018-12-30 23:48:05 Also they were making noises about Iran by then and I wasn't about to put my life on the line for oil companies either.
3443 2018-12-30 23:47:54 It seems like the consensus is Peter Chiarelli happily bought some snake oil from Stan Bowman. #Blackhawks #Oilers #HockeyTwitter #Manning #Caggiula

3446 2018-12-30 23:47:31 Yeah, I'm sure the dead will give him big props.
Also, u should read a bit about his hypocrisy on climate and oil. He signed bills to block drilling in fed. waters to appease rabid anti-trumpers, but his admin greenlit 200 new wells in CA waters and 23K drilling permits.
3447 2018-12-30 23:47:24 Are we at war?  I thought we were fighting America's war for the Middle East's oil.
3448 2018-12-30 23:47:20 And Mom Padre Pio sent you miracle oil for anointing.
3449 2018-12-30 23:47:10 I prefer oil spills too, it makes a beautiful rainbow effect on the water.
3450 2018-12-30 23:47:03 You’re buggin, I’m getting you a sample of the night time oil
3451 2018-12-30 23:46:57 They shoot monkeys out of trees to make palm oil let's start a revolution against it
3452 2018-12-30 23:46:50 #Katz doesn't give a shit as long as his pockets keep filling up with fan's $$$"s! Fans and companies need to STOP feeding an owner who obviously doesn't give a shit about HIS #Oilers! Makes me sick!!!
3453 2018-12-30 23:46:37 Rick Simpson oil is what you need...... Be well!
3454 2018-12-30 23:46:27 i mean, same thing with coconut, right? you don't want mash tun oil and fat. but you want the same oil as hops, i'd think.
3455 2018-12-30 23:46:24 Hmmm. Maybe seal them ghetto sous vide style (dunk the bottom of the ziplock in water to physically force the air out) with some oil and seasoning to get a bit of a protective layer?
3456 2018-12-30 23:46:21 Aga pa dumduman ko na sng una nga gn paluto ko bihon, ang oil na sunog nag kalayo baaaw pwerti mn nga kuyampad ko dalagan pra nd ko pg kigan hahahahaha
3457 2018-12-30 23:46:16 Still waiting on your thoughts on cry baby max's record on energy projects since he would get oil to rosewater.
3458 2018-12-30 23:46:07 I'm currently investigating this.  So far I have found that the @NEBCanada has been "crafting" the PR story that is to be told.
@TransCanada has threatened our Gov legal action IF new upstream GHG reg's come on place, and @RBC is pushing Oil sands as our Only future!
3459 2018-12-30 23:46:06 #oilers fans... Over value what the Oil have then go overboard on how bad the return is.  EVERY. TIME. ANY. MOVE.
3460 2018-12-30 23:45:47 I've heard peppermint oil too.
3461 2018-12-30 23:45:46 Stir together 1 cup ginger with 2 cups barbecue. Mix in Olive Oil. Fry. Serve with salmon
3462 2018-12-30 23:45:44 @Seahawks did someone butter the gloves or spray them with oil? Get the rain gloves out! Keep the ball in our hands!
3463 2018-12-30 23:45:41 if i could just get a firm deep tissue full body oil massage rn i would be the happiest person in the world.
3464 2018-12-30 23:45:36 Wall with moat, drawbridges, boiling oil, all that? Focus
3465 2018-12-30 23:45:36 Lol dash lol coconut oil by yuh nose too
3466 2018-12-30 23:45:19 If you drive/park cars for a living you should know. My Dad made sure I could drive a stick, change a tire and change my own oil before I got my license!
3467 2018-12-30 23:45:18 You are going to love the Anova, I have been using mine for months about 3 times a week. Kust remember it is all about the finishing. 45 seconds in a smoking hot pan with some oil on it will give the meat a nice crust and will make great presentation. Enjoy it
3468 2018-12-30 23:45:18 Try setting down at a negotiating table and hammering out a comprehensive immigration law, instead of trying to make political points.  Every citizen wants strong borders, you idiot. The wall is medieval, are you considering hot oil too?
3469 2018-12-30 23:45:09 I did this. I kept soap, apple cider vinegar, tea tree oil, clay mask, jojoba oil, rosehip oil, powder, blusher, brown eyeshadow and bicarbonate deodorant 
3470 2018-12-30 23:45:01 Olive Oil could have fell it all, fishing in the court.
3471 2018-12-30 23:44:59 put like some garlic powder/ginger a little bit of butter, ketchup, siracha, worcestershire, some sugar, and some soy sauce in ur instant ramen next time it will improve ur quality of life maybe some green onion and some sesame oil too 
ur welcome
3472 2018-12-30 23:44:47 What essential oil do you use for ppl to leave you alone?
3473 2018-12-30 23:44:41 Just use same measurements oil to flour and stir good before putting in microwave. When it starts to bubble take out and stir and keep doing this til it gets the color you want
3474 2018-12-30 23:44:40 That was in 1972 but whatever. 
My point: He had absolutely NOTHING to do with the Beto twitter meltdown so you should never have brought him up. I was bewildered by that. Instead it was started by Neera Tanden a Clinton operative. And upon analysis the oil money was troubling
3475 2018-12-30 23:44:30 "He didn't take oil and gas money, it was simply individual donations from people who happen to own oil companies!"
3476 2018-12-30 23:44:28 Poor Oil. First Hitch who has been a lesson in diminishing returns this century and now these trades. Its must hurt to see your biggest rivals actually not be an epic shit show while your GM continues to be a mess.
3477 2018-12-30 23:44:11 @GregRickford you retweeted this? You're the Minister of Energy. Do you not understand how the price of oil affects gas prices more than cap and trade minimally did? Of course you do, but you're all too happy to play the part of an idiot for your party.
3478 2018-12-30 23:44:10 "Their" oil?  Excuse me, but oil benefits EVERYONE on the planet.  As an engineer you should know that already.  I do as a mechanical engineer.
3479 2018-12-30 23:43:55 Bunch of hash oil was spilled on me and I obviously didn’t wanna waste it or wash it off my hands so I just licked all of it  let’s see how this goes lol
3480 2018-12-30 23:43:51 LOL, what oil pipeline expansion? 
3481 2018-12-30 23:43:30 2/ In the mid-70s, the PET government helped bail out the Syncrude project when Atlantic Richfield bowed out of its promised 30% stake. Winnipeg Agreement. Then, in 1996, when the oil sands weren't profitable, the Chrétien Liberals provided accelerated capital cost allowances. /3
3482 2018-12-30 23:43:13 On AIP, I ate Adell’s chicken and apple sausage, bananas, sliced sweet potatoes fried in coconut oil, uncured bacon, sautéed kale or spinach with the sausage cooked in it.
3483 2018-12-30 23:43:11 You Ain't SHOT that gun all year don't start tomorrow that shit might Jam dry ass gun! Better put some oil on that mf 
3484 2018-12-30 23:42:55 The thing I don't quite get is Katz oblivious to the fact his GM keeps adding to the pile of ineffective players he is going to have to pay in 2019-20? It's baffling #Oilers
3485 2018-12-30 23:42:49 Whisk egg yolk with a tablespoon of olive oil and leave on hair for a few minutes before your shampoo. It makes a great hair conditioner.
3486 2018-12-30 23:42:41 ありがとうございまーす～
3487 2018-12-30 23:42:41 Go to Holland and Barrett and get a bottle of the 5% cbd oil. I have had three operations on my back hun. I take two drops 3 times a day under my tongue and I'm finally pain free.  Be careful if you're on bp tablets as it lowers your bp too xx
3488 2018-12-30 23:42:33 For 30 years my Grandad JB Little owned Standard Oil Gas Station on 67th and Racine. The second gas station my family owned was on 63rd and Damen and my late uncle, Shade Little took over. Somehow. Someway. We have to get back to business ownership in Chicago. Mission. #ownership
3489 2018-12-30 23:42:32 The oil has to have THC as that is what kills the cancer cell. Grow your own make your own oil. Government sponsored growers here in Canada lets growers use sprays that cause cancer.
3490 2018-12-30 23:42:17 “And massage oil.”
3491 2018-12-30 23:42:08 But if you kill the oil & gas industry, how will solar panels, wind turbines, electric cars, hydroelectric dams et al be built?
3492 2018-12-30 23:42:07 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
3493 2018-12-30 23:42:03 Thing is Jason when your club have spent no money to strengthen and have had to play your home games at a stadium everyone hates you know you're probably not going to be toppling clubs that can spend oil money. Add to that injuries to 3 midfielders and there is your answer
3494 2018-12-30 23:41:50 Did they check your oil and wash your windshield too?
3495 2018-12-30 23:41:42 in other news i’ve got my plush faux fur eye mask, my lush sleepy body lotion AND my oil diffuser (diffusing some dank lavender) so yes i AM taking care of myself, goodnight x
3496 2018-12-30 23:41:35 My mom found a beerbong in my room & my brother told her that it was for an oil change lmaooo
3497 2018-12-30 23:41:35 Oooo I thought they were shouting KO bakayi ubanka nayi to Buhari
3498 2018-12-30 23:41:34 Baba is working hard to get his oil...  Back.
3499 2018-12-30 23:41:28 ただの衒学趣味イキリオタクになんと優しい…ありがとうございます。まなてぃーのふぁぼに割と救われながらツイートしてます笑
3500 2018-12-30 23:41:25 @mdtroadreport are y'all going to be sanding I90? Roads are slicker than an oil spill!!! Already saw one semi truck Jack knifed going South on i90 blocking both lanes around 27 miles outside of Billings.
3501 2018-12-30 23:41:24 "Yes I do... Well, it's not exactly massage oil but it's... A lubricant of sorts. In my nightstand," he admitted and blushed.
3502 2018-12-30 23:41:19 I assume you have heard of the OPEC oil crises of the 1970s, and the impact the closure of the Suez Canal had on the UK economy. To suggest that the UK is not vulnerable to possible disruptive trade shocks outside the scope of European trade is quite incredible.
3503 2018-12-30 23:40:57 Got a temporary membership to Fowey Working Men’s Club bcos of course I did and met a bunch of Bristol boys who are off out tomorrow to catch crabs with Taste the Difference Breaded Ham and a man who got stuck on an oil ship in Panama for 6 days bcos of the drone. FOWEY FOREVER.
3504 2018-12-30 23:40:54 @Lin_Manuel do you know who did the oil paintings in the beginning of Mary Poppins? They're great and I would like to try to recreate them!
3505 2018-12-30 23:40:44 Obviously it’s a retired Santa there. He makes a killing on the side selling oil from the North Pole
3506 2018-12-30 23:40:42 hey, you can just bet you’re surrounded by the best and the brightest...... shopping where you can buy “ hammers and panties “ while getting your oil changed....... jus sayin,  it is the way of my people
3507 2018-12-30 23:40:30 ナルルちゃんは素直で可愛いなー。誰かさんもあれぐらい素直だったらいいんだけどなー
3508 2018-12-30 23:40:24 Math is math.

Oil usage will be up.

No matter what you do, think.

Sorry.
3509 2018-12-30 23:40:15 Aqua sun, aries moon, cap venus, sag rising 

I put a vanilla/cinnamon/clove essential oil blend thing on my wrists and throat (perfume makes me die coughing so I avoid it)

3513 2018-12-30 23:40:06 He means salmon oil, to their mouths. Don't just apply any oil 
3514 2018-12-30 23:40:04 @LindseyGrahamSC didn’t @realDonaldTrump say #Mexico was paying for the wall? How is this making #Mexico pay?  You all are a bunch of snake oil salesmen.  Americans don’t want a wall! #NoWall
3515 2018-12-30 23:40:02 Maybe the PM should not be working 4 the UN Globalists 
Which is Not good for 
(Anonymous reports leaders were paid 100m) 

Prefers foreign oil?
No to jobs,royalties
equalization ?
Yes to:
UnaOil Style ?
Working for Tides? Saudis?
offshore accounts?

WHAT would u call that?
3516 2018-12-30 23:39:36 @realDonaldTrump We hired this guy to do the job of running our country, let him do his job. The 'wall' is an expensive idea. We should take Mexico and it's oil basin, give those people jobs, security & protection. They are ruining border markets & bringing 'their' drugs.
3517 2018-12-30 23:39:33 In simple terms let’s hope not! The polar regions need protecting. Currently the only ‘clean’ ships are nuclear powered and these belong in the main to military shipping. Dirty oil burners would no doubt cause irrevocable damage therefore must be refused access.
3518 2018-12-30 23:39:32 Down to my Lastbit of Cannabis~Oil,
that's a Bummer but it Was Good While it Lasted i Wont Lie.
3519 2018-12-30 23:39:31 Tell me why my roommate found ten bottles of expired vegetable oil... TEN
3520 2018-12-30 23:39:30 I'm honest.
I choose my words with care.
Nobody knows what is beyond the grave.
Nobody.
Yet so many claim they do?
Those people are sharmans, shonksters, modern day snake oil salesmen and charlatans. Pundits.
Love your neighbour & treat everybody the way u would like 2B treated.
3521 2018-12-30 23:39:29 Equally, other countries shouldn't be picking up the tab for our mistakes and internal problems. Which they are. Iraq & Libya (War, Oil), Afghanistan (War, NHS morphine) 50% UK food delivered from overseas, tea, coffee, sugar. Damn freeloaders......
3522 2018-12-30 23:39:26 Thank you Gretchen so very much! I was hoping you would share - did not want to ask in case it was a oil you made from it and not into sharing your secret! Grosso - will try to find the seeds!
3523 2018-12-30 23:39:11 they don’t have water proof mascara in the blue unless another brand has it bc i got it from nyx! & personally for me water proof is better bc it makes my lashes actually pop and look long and they actually stay up bc my lashes are flat as hell! to take off just use coconut oil!
3524 2018-12-30 23:39:07 Tell that to Exxon, BP and the other oil companies getting Billions in Federal Tax breaks.
3525 2018-12-30 23:38:59 @Ponfa_GD It took a Nigerian friend of mine with a British passport and his British colleague that works in an oil company in Aberdeen 6 months to get Angolan visa. It's the process, there is nothing like being afraid of any country.
3526 2018-12-30 23:38:49 Omg my avocado oil hair mask is dripping
3527 2018-12-30 23:38:39 via Sparticuszorro: Its not sporting to game this with 3x oil and tesla.

I am withdrawing and studying the crowds better picks. $tsla
3528 2018-12-30 23:38:38 a "rebel rebel" royalty payment came in and nearly exactly covered a car repair (oil change, low tires, the trunk flooding up whenever it rained---that was fun). thanks to whoever got the book in the last 6 months--you helped me out.
3529 2018-12-30 23:38:37 Nope!  All weed oil gone!
3530 2018-12-30 23:38:13 If news broke that Drano, Liquid Plumr, et. al. were selling snake oil for the drain, I would not be surprised.
3531 2018-12-30 23:38:09 She made matzo ball soup with keep in the flour, and she made Jewish Apple Cake with infused coconut oil. I’m intrigued.

3536 2018-12-30 23:37:50 BOLD FACED LIED TO HIS VOTERS!WE WILL SEE HOW THEY TAKE THE NEWS THEY WERE CONED BY THIS SNAKE OIL SALESMAN! SINCE KELLYANN & EX GENERAL KELLY ARE SAYING IT ON TV! #TRUMP RESIGN OR BE #IMPEACHED
3537 2018-12-30 23:37:43 Just a reminder that Vikings fans consider mike zimmer a god and PJ fleck a snake oil salesman. Why? I have no idea.
3538 2018-12-30 23:37:40 Call a spade a spade. If it’s a crap deal for one club, so be it. Some GMs don’t make great choices, that’s just business. Just seems the Oil continue to get fleeced in these. I’m curious what a mgmt structure outside the boys club could do. Such potential in its’ star players
3539 2018-12-30 23:37:39 Rebels down 1-0 to the Oil Kings after 1 period in Edmonton. Shots are 14-10 EDM. #RDR
3540 2018-12-30 23:37:39 Sounds like a productive day. Bought ingredients (olive oil, garlic & anchovies) to make Bagna Cauda, a traditional dish we make on New Year's Eve. Dip Savoy cabbage, shrimp, etc in it, catch the drippings on Italian bread & drink a dry red . It's actually very good.

3544 2018-12-30 23:36:52 Agreed. I take the Bjorn Lomborg perspective. It’s not a catastrophe but it is a serious challenge and requires serious, macro level solutions, which includes big gubmint to a large extent. Bloomberg is a globalist but he’s right in this instance.
3545 2018-12-30 23:36:50 Always remember media destroying Howard Dean, Jimmy Carter, declaring Richard Jewel the Atlanta bomber, declaring Hillary winner of the 2016 election, failing to investigate Iraq money/oil trail, proliferating mass shootings by "advertising" Columbine. #DangerousMedia

3547 2018-12-30 23:36:40 THERE ARE ALSO TWO AMI ORGANIZATIONS IN WACO. ONE IS ANTIOCH MISSIONS INTERNATIONAL. THE OTHER IS AN OIL COMPANY CALLED "AMI."

WHY IS THAT? MOST PEOPLE WOULD ASSUME SOMEONE IS TRYING TO HIDE. 

GOD SAYS (AND CORRECT ME IF I GOT THIS WRONG) THAT THEY DO THAT IN WACO OFTEN. COPY.
3548 2018-12-30 23:36:38 I just dabbed an entire tube of hemp oil. It didn't get me high, but my lungs have never felt so soft and silky!

3551 2018-12-30 23:36:14 Here’s the main thing with Saudi Arabia. They’ve passed peak oil! They passed it a few years ago. Their ineffective struggle to maintain production #’s and MbS’s Vision 2030 program should be plenty of evidence to show their slipping influence w/ petroleum.
3552 2018-12-30 23:36:07 yeah my dad did one oil change on it and even after that he said he won't do it anymore  i love my vw though its such a good car
3553 2018-12-30 23:36:05 A heart felt thank you, President Trump. We the People burned the midnight oil in prayer Nov 2016, and God answered us. We the People love you, respect you and are so very thankful for you and your family. We stand with you and keep you in prayer..always.

3558 2018-12-30 23:35:15 Putin's best move is to surrender to the west and isolate China.
Which of you out there thinks he has the sense?
Odds are he just loves playing the game
and
oil will be in the hands of speculators in 2019.
3559 2018-12-30 23:35:15 Lindsey Graham is literally the servant who tells the Emperor his new suit is splendid!

The man sells  oil!
3560 2018-12-30 23:35:13 Said the man who is bought by Big Oil.
3561 2018-12-30 23:35:03 Calling all abang2 transport!! Corporate Companies enjoy a special price at $49 nett up to 4 litres of fully synthetic engine oil.  Extra per litre use at $12. What are you waiting for?? Whatsapp me at 86602496 to make an appt!
3562 2018-12-30 23:34:57 And, pray tell, how does leaving oil in the ground help our economy?
3563 2018-12-30 23:34:49 Short term capex debt is what’s killing pipelines and rates on that debt is going up

Long term as renewable and nat gas with the help of electric cars displaces oil they will continue to slide

3568 2018-12-30 23:33:42 Thank you @paleogrubs I never ate a parsnip in my life. Then, in 2018 I started making fries made with parsnips. They even have truffle oil
#omg
3569 2018-12-30 23:33:28 Idk if that helps oil though. But I also only put the powder on my oily t-zone so I don’t look cakey all over
3570 2018-12-30 23:33:25 I'm far far too lazy though and opt for Corrie Enders and an early night when others are burning the midnight oil editing and blogging xx

3573 2018-12-30 23:33:06 I got an essential oil diffuser for Christmas and I think I’m in love with it
3574 2018-12-30 23:32:59 Steeler fans smell like old motor oil and cheese puffs
3575 2018-12-30 23:32:53 Awesome! It reminds me of John Conway’s work. This an oil painting btw?
3576 2018-12-30 23:32:37 i got an oil diffuser for christmas and im enjoying it but im curious whether it goes only as far as oil or if theres some dumb shit you could put in it to take it to the next level
3577 2018-12-30 23:32:30 We have enough of our own oil, and the climate is effed so we have to go green anyway

3581 2018-12-30 23:32:13 @LindseyGrahamSC has been a spineless flipper as long as I can remember. He moves with the wind, whatever insures HIS paycheck. He screwed me when I was in the Army, he’s screwed women out of equal & fair treatment, etc. He’s a goddam snake oil salesman. Nothing more.
3582 2018-12-30 23:32:13 So, you'll be debating gravity next?
Denying scientific evidence for the sake of hustling an extra buck for your benefactors/owners in the oil and gas industry is not a defensible position.
3583 2018-12-30 23:32:05 Answered over and over, what we have gained in FAIR trade by scrapping N.A.F.T.A and renegotiating a better deal for America, more than pays for a wall, A mote, and burning oil to pour from the top of the wall.
3584 2018-12-30 23:31:59 Not honey oil,etc. What is it ?
3585 2018-12-30 23:31:51 Interesting. Learned something new. Thanks. But now I'm curious: Are you implying that the oil companies somehow prefer Beto to Cruz?
3586 2018-12-30 23:31:46 @BruceMcCurdy Smart Chi observer @MarkLazerus sees it as Hawks fixing error of signing Manning to current deal. Mind you, Hawks have actual NHL d-men, including one Brandon Davidson (hurt) and Erik Gustafsson, who Oil drafted, couldn’t be arsed to sign: 21 pts in 38 games. Ugh.
3587 2018-12-30 23:31:37 Can it be done from Soy oil!  
NJ is leader in Soy production!
3588 2018-12-30 23:31:23 Take some Excedrin.

Peppermint oil on back of neck, &  temples. If someone could massage your temples or massage your hands it helps. Get better
3589 2018-12-30 23:31:14 How about implementation of alternatives to dirty oil? Stop giving money to Oil Sands & construction of pipelines. Reinvest in a viable Carbon Free future for Canada & our children. There are viable Solutions, what are you waiting for? Change now @UNFCCC
3590 2018-12-30 23:31:13 Baby oil works
3591 2018-12-30 23:31:13 Ah well ... turns out that #BritainsFavouriteChocolate is just a long-winded bit of product placement for Kraft Foods as they try to rebuild the reputation of Dairy Milk despite the fact that they ruined it with a heavy dose of palm oil.

And where was the Star Bar?
3592 2018-12-30 23:31:04 Which essential oil is best for getting people to stop talking to you?
3593 2018-12-30 23:31:00 Oh good lord, can you say "snake oil"?
3594 2018-12-30 23:31:00 LMAOOOO. Reason 638282652 why i aint got time!!!! You know how hard it is to get oil up bitch??? Lmao!!
3595 2018-12-30 23:30:58 We get a lot of oil from the North sea as well .... But natural gas is the biggest concern atm, especially in mid-europe, ie Germany. Theres been talk about a gas-line from the US to EU, so we could get rid og Russian dependence.
3596 2018-12-30 23:30:56 I'm a lifelong Dem very often to the left of my representatives.  I have worked for oil & gas companies and electric utilities wut commitment to coal plants.  My donations to Obama and Clinton would look like fossil fuel donations.
3597 2018-12-30 23:30:55 This is definitely The BEST we've tried. It's not at Coles, or Aldi. We brown it with a splash of rice bran oil in the pan, on high heat initially. Takes a while to brown properly, but does best with the high heat. Absorbs spices very well, so you can cut back a bit on them.
3598 2018-12-30 23:30:54 Heck. We don't need solar or coal or oil.... Just hook the country up to @AOC . That will power the country for years!
3599 2018-12-30 23:30:43 The Arabs have oil to use to be anti Israel have attacked Israel each time finish up losing to Israel. #Abbas I recommend you do a peace deal now because Israel has technology that countries want even Arab countries you are losing your support. Nobody takes any notice of the UN
3600 2018-12-30 23:30:42 Dear Thomas. This is what it feels like.

Except it's not what it feels like, and it won't be until 99 out of 100 anchor positions are women in every industry (except logging and oil rigging).
3601 2018-12-30 23:30:40 John Cornyn, using scientific terminology you are equivocating. 

There is no doubt in anybody's mind (except corporate oil companies) that climate change is happening.

3607 2018-12-30 23:30:07 Entré a YouTube a buscar el nombre de un tema y voy por la decimotercera entrevista a Armie Hammer. 13.
Es un ñoño de los nudos, le mandaban muchos conjuntos deportivos, escribe sus líneas a mano para aprenderselas, es bisnieto de un oil tycooSE MÁS DE ESTE TIPO QUE DE MI VIEJA.
3608 2018-12-30 23:30:03 可愛いがたっぷり……
3609 2018-12-30 23:29:58 先日はお付きあいありがとうございました
ホントにいいと思ってるんですよ
ホントですよがははは……‥…………(^ー^)ｸﾞｰｸﾞｰ
3610 2018-12-30 23:29:53 Dont wanna be that guy but cars in the beach is a No-Go...leaking oil, other fluids etc
3611 2018-12-30 23:29:53 Yeah that Al Gore. Created a world wide conspiracy against big oil just to enrich himself and a few buddies. That evil conniving Al Gore. And smoking is not harmful either.
3612 2018-12-30 23:29:47 That. Is. Exactly. How it works. No matter what arcane financial skullduggery disguises them, trillions in direct and indirect tax payer subsidies have been directed to big oil for decades and a small fraction of those funds will literally save hundreds of thousands of lives.
3613 2018-12-30 23:29:43 Seems like the Oil are trying to corner the market on 6/7 defensemen. Strange moves. Seems a little desperate to me.
3614 2018-12-30 23:29:37 Hi, Randy. Its just getting the right moisture, chile paste, and a small amount of Palm oil shortening. Happy New year to you and your family!
3615 2018-12-30 23:29:27 Do you mean that the budget is an Eldorado that has brought a sight of sound of sadness to the National Assembly and to Nigeria in general? The benchmark of oil price which the budget is based is already an aberration because the price is nose diving. May be we might borrow.
3616 2018-12-30 23:29:17 I need to go get a oil change go do wigs and go to the bank and go to Walmart and still manage to make it to work on time  think goodness for online bill payments if I trust people picking out my eggs and bread I would definitely make groceries online I be busy asf
3617 2018-12-30 23:29:12 Ahh Thank you! And you can do it! Oil paint is so fun and easy in my opinion amd there is tons of videos online that explain all the things you need to get started (: I would specifically refer you too @LenaDanya and @happydartist 's videos!
3618 2018-12-30 23:29:09 Oil is never used in e-cigs; its Propylene Glycol, Vegetable Glycerine, flarovings (most flavors are in a PG solution), and nicotine if you want nic in your e-juice.

Vaping oil would be *very* bad for you.
3619 2018-12-30 23:29:00 Getting some oil paints. Super pricey but I have a good feeling bout this 
3620 2018-12-30 23:28:46 Plan for tonight, take a much-needed shower, take some very sedating medication, smoke some hash oil, listen to Mogwai and Arab Strap. And finally go to bed at a reasonable hour.

If I'm not sleeping by 2 a.m. tonight I'm going to take extra medication so I can sleep.
3621 2018-12-30 23:28:46 Bio Oil definitely has helped me with dark spots
3622 2018-12-30 23:28:45 Defence or offense? When will UK stop helping big brother in warring the middle east for its' oil?
3623 2018-12-30 23:28:45 Rebranded as "Burning oil"
3624 2018-12-30 23:28:43 I agree but, of course, the middle east has oil ergo....
3625 2018-12-30 23:28:38 Individuals. Individuals. Individuals. How many families, how many well-off individuals do I know who work in Oil and Gas and yet wholeheartedly supported Beto? Every other house on our cul de sac is in that category, and 25% of our Dem Club. Not everything is a conspiracy.
3626 2018-12-30 23:28:25 Knowingly funded Hamas, allowed and even praised returning ISIS fighters, verbally degrade Canadian labor workers in the oil field, disregard CSIS reports on Sikh extremism in Canada, stifle free speech against Islam. The list goes on and on.
3627 2018-12-30 23:28:21 Loool, my beard was actually bigger than this, my barber decided to make it shorter. But yh, I just use beard oil every morning. A good beard brush and beard comb is needed I'd say. I also use a beard shampoo every couple of days. It takes time though. Just let it grow out

3629 2018-12-30 23:28:03 This Thursday in the Plains Producer after an extensive one week break. I flick the switch on my time machine and revisit the farming era that was the 1980’s. high interest rates farmer owned bulk storage single desk marketing peak oil ? No gps no iPhone no twitter facebook

3632 2018-12-30 23:27:41 @Bob_Stauffer can you please have Chiarelli on so you can ask him about the Blackhawks trade? And specifically ask him how he feels him asset management has been. This has been the worst GM the Oil have ever had. Makes Lowe/MacT  good.
3633 2018-12-30 23:27:34 US Crude oil $45.65 a barrel.
3634 2018-12-30 23:27:25 Can’t believe I listened to my mum and used coconut oil to get the rest of my individual eyelashes out...my left eye is bold :) happy new year x
3635 2018-12-30 23:27:21 Science is all about actual facts, and not about trying to pander to hacks to create a artificial balance just because you feel that being in bed with the oil and gas companies is more important then conserving the environment

3637 2018-12-30 23:27:16 I've been using CBD oil and it's been relatively effective... until recently, I've had a flare because I departed from dietary constraints :(
3638 2018-12-30 23:27:13 Are you concerned with platics in the ocean, toxic coal ash dumped in your drinking water? Oil spills?
3639 2018-12-30 23:27:04 We need to destroy America so we can get all that oil and gold! Communism can survive for a century on America's wealth!
3640 2018-12-30 23:27:02 There is a a LOT of money in oil. It’s one of the most corrupted industries around. Which is why even the indisputable science and the near unanimous consensus among scientists barely affected the industry.  (Cont.)
3641 2018-12-30 23:26:54 People don’t realize how easy it is. I’ll post a picture of a steak and lobster tails on IG and friends will say “OMG how did you cook that?”

I turned the pan on, put some oil on it & then put the meat on until it was seared on both sides. $70 restaurant meal for $20 in 20 mins.
3642 2018-12-30 23:26:50 The only robot from the original who needed to come back was R2. The other one needed to drown in a vat of oil and disintegrate with rust

3645 2018-12-30 23:26:36 Robyn Allan you look like a fool posting this easily understood oil market
3646 2018-12-30 23:26:35 Took care of my oil change by myself for the first time like wow I’m really grown now.
3647 2018-12-30 23:26:09 And regarding Middle East, the American oil industry!
3648 2018-12-30 23:26:08 The only people who are “ignoring science” are the greens. “Green energy” is a flop and undercutting Canada’s clean oil production will cause an environmental disaster. It’s a matter of basic physics, chemistry and economics.
3649 2018-12-30 23:26:02 Leftists have *never* been honest about global cooling, er, warming, er, climate change. Their *only* focus has been coming up with justifications to keep selling their snake oil.
3650 2018-12-30 23:26:02 Idiots. If we are still extracting oil, there is no reason not to export it. If we produce more than US market absorbs, we need trade deals to sell our surplus. This has nothing to do with progressive vs moderate it has to do with stupid vs smart to keep workers employed.
3651 2018-12-30 23:25:53 You should start by example. Stop buying anything that is paid with oil money, and make sure that your doctor ask you to refund the part of his fee paid with the same money
3652 2018-12-30 23:25:53 We should respect the the snake oil salesman who wants to give us A nAZI TO BE PRSIDENT!
3653 2018-12-30 23:25:51 Stuffy nose I drink really strong mint tea with honey (honey soothes the throat as well as the heat of the water and mint clears nasal passages). Before I sleep, I put vicks or peppermint oil near my nose. All lot of it is also changing diet to avoid dairy bc it produces more

3658 2018-12-30 23:25:10 Put a born-again Armenian in charge of Turkish trade, Mr. President -or he will extinguish any trade with Armenians -they're still genociding us, stealing our antiquities, destroying our cemeteries and Azerbadjian uses what used to be our oil in Baku to buy opinion against us!
3659 2018-12-30 23:25:09 Hitmen take today's game by a 4-0 score. David Tendeck made 39 saves for the Vancouver. The Giants are now 1-1 on the road trip. The Edmonton Oil Kings are up next on Tuesday afternoon at 1 PM PT..

3664 2018-12-30 23:24:33 Just so I understand, your article with the following sub headers is NOT an attack on O'Rourke but an article promoting open primaries?

Can you show me where you make mention of open primaries other than your closing paragraph?
3665 2018-12-30 23:24:23 This is a old news but still right on point when it comes to cons (Oil Heritage Fund) vs the Norway oil fund. Despite being a so called socialist country Norway outsmarted the conservatives in being more pro market pro oil and saved Trillion and Alberta we all know the truth.

3680 2018-12-30 23:21:42 Mate you're an oil funded club and below us. Pipe down. Also lucky 'know' Chelsea fans were on that train with their racist hustle and bustle forcing you off it.
3681 2018-12-30 23:21:30 You’re missing the point. The greens actively campaign against  ’s energy independence and use of oil. Relying of foreign oil means less ethical and much dirtier energy. And moving away from oil means living in the Bronze Age. Period. It’s a simple matter of physics&chemistry

The use for #XRP is bigger than @ripple. And theres nothing stopping banks from using #BTC as it matures.Especially in terms of custody

3699 2018-12-30 23:19:43 I can agree, oil from the old days would not flow well until the engine was warm, also increasing wear if you drive it cold.   But before fuel injection, the performance wasn’t there until warm because the atomized fuel literally condensed back to droplets inside the cold intake.
3700 2018-12-30 23:19:36 Yes! I have actually done that once. Well, anointed are home with oil. It made the heat turn on...
3701 2018-12-30 23:19:25 Data is the oil of the 21st century
3702 2018-12-30 23:19:19 For instance, there is a guy at the Chevron Houston office whose job it is to....um...."encourage" employees to donate in accordance with the company's wishes. If this was simply a numbers game of oil being a big industry, his oil donations would equivalent in % to other TX Dems.
3703 2018-12-30 23:19:17 The gas prices have nothing to do with the yet to be imposed carbon tax or with anything the Regressive Conservative party has done. Oil is selling for $45.00 U.S. a barrel, that's why prices are low. Justin Trudeau will impose the carbon tax and Doug will bitch and moan.

3707 2018-12-30 23:18:41 I took my girl's car to get an oil change, got her a car wash, and filled her tank. I'm not telling y'all this for attention, but if your woman matters to you, you'll go out of your way to treat her right. Show that woman you care by doing small things that make HER life easier.
3708 2018-12-30 23:18:39 Ah the joys of being half blind.  Got a new frying pan for Christmas. Took down the veggie oil from the top shelf -- knocking off the glass olive oil bottle -- SMASH! Depth perception. Sucks to be me.
3709 2018-12-30 23:18:38 I will say. I used to have bumpy skin a little bit behind my arms and on my legs and they’re completely gone having started to use my body oil Elixa after showering regularly

3711 2018-12-30 23:18:27 Simple, corporate greed buries the evidence of their wrong doing  environmental or other by buying politicians, tainting those who seek the truth, if a massive oil slick with a dead polar bear floating lands outside @PaddyWoodworth front door might he consider the risk impact

3713 2018-12-30 23:18:20 Disasters force governments to use public money as it has the potential to be used. If only they would see that unemployment is a social disaster and respond as they would with, say, an earthquake or an oil spill. 

The level of unemployment is a policy choice.

3721 2018-12-30 23:17:22 We've been having this debate about oil donations for 20 years in Texas, and I'm afraid I don't view the matter as simplistically as you do. Those donations are accomplished through internal company bundlers.

3729 2018-12-30 23:16:49 No, we live in China. I'm not an academic in the accepted sense. 
In the final furlong of a PhD I chucked it all in to get married and live in China. I've been in the UK for the last ten months dealing with a family issue. 
Back to building oil and gas pipelines soon (I hope!).

3736 2018-12-30 23:15:32 やはり買いましたか
がははは…‥…………(^ー^)
あっ！おはようごさいます。
3737 2018-12-30 23:15:19 I love OIL PASTELS! I used them this morning. When I do my mural art! Most of it is all oil pastel based! Also, the blending you can get with this as to convey emotions is my favorite.
3738 2018-12-30 23:15:19 Wouldn't be legal on the commercial scale, or that might be the way to go. I'm doing my best to wick away the oil before the infusion, we'll see!
3739 2018-12-30 23:15:19 Lavender oil in a diffuser (if available), deep breaths and OTC pain med if it becomes unbearable
3740 2018-12-30 23:15:18 more likely they become an executive at an oil corps, then executed.

3742 2018-12-30 23:15:00 Someone just made +12.82% on WCX: buy WTI Crude Oil 44.939 → 45.245 (20x leverage)  ~ OOOULALA $WTICO $USD
3743 2018-12-30 23:14:50 Oil prices are low everywhere.  Climate change is the biggest threat to global security for everyone under the age of 40.  Cap and trade is the most efficient tax from economic perspective for inducing a demand shift.  Conservative policy is milk toast or worse picking winners.
3744 2018-12-30 23:14:48 Good for those people that are calling out the press ( @CNN ) for continuing to give free air time to liars and crooks. If there is one thing the press should have learned from the 2016 election, it is that giving a megaphone to PROVEN snake oil salesmen enabled this mess.
3745 2018-12-30 23:14:47 "The grooviest and whitest things in the world cannot be pursued or even pursued - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
3746 2018-12-30 23:14:36 Not sure I want the oils though? The usual suggestion for nuts is to get rid of the oil first (I've got the toasted nuts in paper bags to wick the surface oil away).
3747 2018-12-30 23:14:35 Im'a try the peppermint oil now and the tea after dinner. Thank you. This shit is bogus AF.
3748 2018-12-30 23:14:30 おめでとうございます
大変ですがお仕事頑張って
ください。
良いお年を...
3749 2018-12-30 23:14:27 It’s because there is no upside for oil. Yay Chiarelli 
3750 2018-12-30 23:14:22 One of my goals is to get my oil changed on time all 2019. lettuce see how this goes lmao.
3751 2018-12-30 23:14:10 Have you watched the oil prices?  That will lead you to the reason for lower gas prices across the nation, not just Ontario.  The market has been flooded by the US, Saudi, Russia etc.
3752 2018-12-30 23:13:56 one time I said I don’t like when it gets violently bright in the name of olive oil and oregano
3753 2018-12-30 23:13:53 New season of Oil Change should be 
3754 2018-12-30 23:13:40 Dang! I want to try those guys!

Mine wasn't really at all authentic, but tasty. Use rice vinegar and white pepper for the heat. No mushrooms in the house (grr), so coarsely chopped caulifower did the trick. Corn starch, sesame oil, egg, broth, etc. all played a role as well.
3755 2018-12-30 23:13:26 $80M comes from, most recently, the Alberta govt thru Notley and is debatable. Important to note the live show wasn’t about pipelines or oil, so I don’t have copious notes on those subjects.
3756 2018-12-30 23:13:19 I get migraines and it sometimes help if you put a bit of peppermint oil right under your nose or drink some peppermint tea
3757 2018-12-30 23:13:10 My cousin wants me to make wings... He brings back everything except cooking oil.. Meanwhile my little brother wants me to show him how.. And doesn't know where to find the wings in a grocery store.. ‍
3758 2018-12-30 23:13:03 I have two daughters, yeah gun violence scares me, but #ClimateChange scares me more.   By your logic, oil money is bliss money, and the Dems are COVERED in it.
3759 2018-12-30 23:13:01 I’m not blindly following and justifying the irrational behavior of any man. I am a full fledged free thinker. I’m better than most because I have done my independent research AND everything I’ve seen shows this dude is a snake oil salesman.
3760 2018-12-30 23:12:54 To be accurate, our 70% supermajority constantly stifles progressive legislation like our single payer bill and a climate bill supported by 50 EJ groups in favor of one written by the oil industry.
3761 2018-12-30 23:12:50 Your pressing was for your blessing. The oil is about to overflow.
3762 2018-12-30 23:12:42 Would an eight-cylinder engine be an acceptable modern substitute for a menorah? It’d fire on one cylinder on the first day, two cylinders on the second, and so on until the eighth. Ironically it would actually need an eight-day supply of oil, probably a non-miraculous amount.
3763 2018-12-30 23:12:35 @dstaples @NHLbyMatty hello people who are smarter than me! Confused-aren’t the Oil over the cap now and if so, what does this mean?
3764 2018-12-30 23:12:32 Gotta get my oil change apparently
3765 2018-12-30 23:12:27 fw nivea men yang mint charcoal kalo ak salah itu emang bahannya kurang cocok buat muka cewek tapi parah bikin mulus kek kaga ada dosa komuk gua :((

3766 2018-12-30 23:12:23 
3767 2018-12-30 23:12:22 New Years Eve dinner: deviled eggs with caviar, brisket, steak fries, sautéed green beans and olive oil cake. And lots of champers
3768 2018-12-30 23:12:16 Andrew Age 5 would've been over the moon about that. 

I had a weird thing about abstracted industrial things -- gas storage tanks, freight trains, oil tankers...
3769 2018-12-30 23:12:12 I love goats. I love stinky cheese. I do not love cheese that tastes the way boy-goats smell. That is all cheap chèvre. I'd rather eat the soap that the cilantro genetic mutants say it tastes like. Also, most truffle oil is fake and disgusting.
3770 2018-12-30 23:12:08 And me losing my job came after the NDP, but because of the oil price crash.
More to do with the previous PC government reliance on a single resource economy.
This gvt has done a good job of trying to diversify the economy.

And here we are, 2 people who started new businesses.
3771 2018-12-30 23:12:06 Have you had a mental evaluation recently. I think you need an oil change. Arshol.
3772 2018-12-30 23:12:00 Someone just made +11.91% on WCX: buy WTI Crude Oil 44.989 → 45.275 (20x leverage)  ~ OOOULALA $WTICO $USD
3773 2018-12-30 23:11:55 "I know this is a fact". What? My, there is a statement open to interpretation - Anna can't even get her facts right - we weren't the sick man of Europe until after we joined the *EEC*, after the effects of the oil crisis and after we'd abandoned exports to the Commonwealth.
3774 2018-12-30 23:11:40 If you paid attention to Trudeau policies (weapons deals to genocidal regimes, oil pipeline exapansion/anti-environmentalism, corporate welfare) you'd realize we already have Trump in Canada.
3775 2018-12-30 23:11:39 The data does not include offshored emissions: Apple makes machines in China in factories powered by coal & imports them in sulpherous oil burning container ships. Ship emissions not counted by any nation. CO2 in imports not counted by importing nations. See D Helm, Carbon Crunch
3776 2018-12-30 23:11:13 Sirota's hatchet job conflates small individual donations by Texans who happen to work for Texas' largest industry with corporate money from oil-industry-funded PACs. It's an intentional distortion, following his marching orders to kneecap a potential rival of St. Bernard.
3777 2018-12-30 23:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza for lunch today will be: undercooked crust with moist coconut oil and chicken.
3778 2018-12-30 23:11:07 i like how i am surprised that i feel sick to my stomach after eating fried food like no shit it’s just food coated in flour and egg and cooked in pure OIL why am i like this
3779 2018-12-30 23:10:55 Peppermint oil or eucalyptus oil soaked cotton wool in the pantry. 
Also always store a dry bay leaf in dry goods like rice & flour.
3780 2018-12-30 23:10:48 I oppose Trump-style POLICIES which are the very similar to Trudeau's policies (weapons deals to genocidal regimes, massive oil pipeline expansion, corporate welfare). 

If you're afraid of Trump-style politics, sorry we've already got it.
3781 2018-12-30 23:10:25 Still going to win a cup before flames, it’s just the lows are lower as an Oil fan. Gaudreau will always be too small for playoffs.
3782 2018-12-30 23:10:20 High quality defence men are expensive and the Oil aren’t trading McDavid to acquire one. Wait! Chia just might do that.
3783 2018-12-30 23:10:17 So chia who I’m not a huge fan of. Traded a whipping boy for @EdmontonOilers fans & now the fan base is pissed off. So nothing ever changes in oil country. We need to trade this guy & this guy the GM does. The trade happens & then why did we do that ? #
3784 2018-12-30 23:10:12 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！
3785 2018-12-30 23:10:10 Turn it to oil and use it to fry plantain.
3786 2018-12-30 23:10:10 I just buzzed my eyebrows a lil bit butt naked after smothering my titties in cocoa butter oil so now all the little eyebrow hairs are stuck to my tits  welcome to my life
3787 2018-12-30 23:10:08 Toast with a bit of light olive oil spread and tomato basil cream cheese, then 2 slices of smoked leg ham and a handfull of baby spinach AHHHHH SO DELICIOUS
3788 2018-12-30 23:10:03 @FatKidDeals any essential oil diffuser sales for prime users :)?
3789 2018-12-30 23:09:58 Good for you! Kick them right to the curb. Look into CBD oil to help with the cravings and mood. In particular full spectrum oil. Hemp-derived is legal in all 50 states.
3790 2018-12-30 23:09:44 Carbon pricing works to help change our behaviour & our dependence on oil! Ask premier Horgan in BC- carbon pricing for 10 years

3792 2018-12-30 23:09:37 He left because he didn't want to choose between protecting his secret identity & helping people, & chose to do both. He saved those people on the oil rig because they were more important than his alias, & he used Superman as a disguise to save the world.
3793 2018-12-30 23:09:34 Fairy lights. Listening to ocean waves on my Sharper Image. Journaling. CBD oil. Grateful for positive ways to practice self-care. #Tranquility #Mindfulness #BodyMindSoul
3794 2018-12-30 23:09:33 Do you wear clothes shoes ? Do you eat drink? All made with Oil. Tell me how you are getting rid of oil?
3795 2018-12-30 23:09:21 The efficiencies will have to come from the public service as expenditures continue to exceed revenue. With low oil prices the situation has only grown worse.@ChesCrosbie
3796 2018-12-30 23:09:15 That’s more rhetoric. As we aren’t exporting oil by oil tanker now, it can’t be funding anything can it? There’s no such extra money exporting oil half way around the world to China when they’re paying the same discounted price. Overproduction created the supply glut.
3797 2018-12-30 23:09:00 They look like they’re getting it regularly, drinking a lot of water and rubbing coconut oil every morning and night.

3799 2018-12-30 23:08:56 Everyone should know by now that we're in an environmental crisis and need to rely less on oil products. It's important to identify what we're using that is oil based so we can seek alternatives. Partying while we die on a burning earth is an alternative but not a very good one
3800 2018-12-30 23:08:56 You don’t give a guy who broke you’re record of most NOT LOSING BACK TO BACK SEASONS a second chance. 

If that’s the case then we should give the Captain of the Exxon Valdez another oil tanker and a fifth of Jack Daniels and have at it.
3801 2018-12-30 23:08:48 Hi, Christine.

Ontario never had a carbon tax, but thanks to Dear Leader we will be getting one he can handily blame on the Feds. Will he admit he's wrong when gas prices go back up next summer? Last time I checked, ON has no say in oil prices, no matter how big Doug's head is.
3802 2018-12-30 23:08:43 Everytime i try to convince my dad to buy a spoiler for my car he just tries to convince me to get an oil change 
3803 2018-12-30 23:08:35 Related: much of the modern Democratic Party donor base consists of millionaires and billionaires who hope to get even richer off climate change alarmism and related scams (e.g. shipping oil via railroads that they own in part instead of via pipeline).
3804 2018-12-30 23:08:23 Have covered my entire body in bio oil and moisturiser
3805 2018-12-30 23:08:22 Don’t let 29 play with 97 again this season. The Oil need 29 to get going on his own to open up space for 97. Can’t happen on the same line.
3806 2018-12-30 23:08:15 Well, I won't go vegan but less meat is a case and especially caring more about food  in general. For example I avoid products with palm oil and try to make a lot things on my own instead of using a ready made product which means I make my own rolls, pasta, nougat cream, etc.

3809 2018-12-30 23:07:53 hope so! Really happy to see that CA pursues criminal charges against companies that behave so recklessly and with disregard for safety. They filed criminal charges against a certain oil company for its pipeline spill in Santa Barbara. People get jail but companies get fines. Sad

3815 2018-12-30 23:07:00 I rotate between Suave Sleek and Shine and Garnier Whole Blends (the one with coconut oil and cocoa butter). Both work wonders, but I especially adore the Garnier one because it makes my hair soft as a cloud.
3816 2018-12-30 23:06:54 Manning better than Garrison, Petrovic better than Wideman, at least that is what the Oil hope, minor deals, nothing to lose.
3817 2018-12-30 23:06:53 Apply oil to ferrets. And they don't care. Seriously. They are so distracted you can get away with almost anything.
3818 2018-12-30 23:06:52 1: You talk like all of AB's oil revenue goes to Ottawa. It doesn't
2: Equalization $ is a small portion of tax revenue Ottawa receives. Think of it like a top up
3: AB decided on oil subsidies and low royalties
4: Kenney was key in the drafting of the Equalization formula
5: lol

Brilliant
3821 2018-12-30 23:06:42 Oil of Olay! Works for me...
3822 2018-12-30 23:06:40 Haynes Manual for post-apocalyptic vehicles doesn’t specify automatic or manual gearbox. A manual would be less thirsty which is useful when oil production ceases.
3823 2018-12-30 23:06:24 My hair really grow off dirt and oil.
3824 2018-12-30 23:06:15 Finally got me a oil pen been on the hunt for one great investment
3825 2018-12-30 23:05:59 Trouble didn't find him. He could have left those men on the oil rig to die, & refused to help under all other multiple aliases he took, before becoming Superman. Hell. He didn't even have to leave Smallville. He could just stop using his powers & no one would ever know. 1
3826 2018-12-30 23:05:52 Capitalism is what's sustaining this mess in the first place! The oil industry is so dominant that they can effectively stomp out anyone trying to implement alternative energy via the market, in order to protect their own profits

3828 2018-12-30 23:05:46 Starting the futures week, oil looks hungry, gold has a low timeframe rising wedge. Crossing my fingers for some sweet equities action.

3830 2018-12-30 23:05:07 Actually as an FYI, while you would use silicone oil/lube to try shine the outside of smoothskin neoprene... on the inside where it's lined (with spandex in this case), you'd want water-based lube instead... ;)

FFS If you think things better here and in EU since 9-11 you are a traitor. Simple as that.Oil Wars caused by Blairites like you. Hypocritical and we all have to deal with reality.
3833 2018-12-30 23:04:56 Vegetable oil in the cookies? That's a vegetable dish!

3836 2018-12-30 23:04:36  no problem continue being the typical African and wonder why the world powers use y'all as dumping grounds for their waste and your oil as ways to enrich their citizens...yet your leaders rush their kids over there to have a source of imunity once the centre no longer holds.
3837 2018-12-30 23:04:34 The words "real progress..." jumped off that page.  Lie. Who on earth believes that?? Our core energy stength is in complete shambles, maybe irreparable, oil price dumped, Leap Manifesto gang ran the puppet like a sewing machine, and we are a world laughingstock.
3838 2018-12-30 23:04:26 This spoke to me so many times — with a lab tech mom, an engineer dad and a childhood in Oklahoma (our pilgrimages were to Dallas)... and gorging on those bamboo shoots in chili oil! Thanks for writing and for sharing.
3839 2018-12-30 23:04:18 The love and care from your mama will fix it.  Medium lang yung efficascent oil haha!

Go Canada. Support Canadian  oil support convoy
3842 2018-12-30 23:03:48 Most Cadbury's chocolate is bloody 'orrible thanks to Kraft - swapping cocoa butter for palm oil.  Blleeeergh!
3843 2018-12-30 23:03:45 @CadburyAU still using palm oil bet your sales are dropping - your using cheap ingredients to make your product that’s damaging to habitats or animals - disgrace

3855 2018-12-30 23:02:06 Nah! Oil is a curse dontchaknow they would much rather frack Lancashire until it splits the the country in 2 and they can be an island nation.  And the Disaster Relief Funds will come in handy incase the Queen needs her palaces decorated again. #LittleEngland

3860 2018-12-30 23:00:59 Have you tried oil cleansing? It helps with acne and works as a gentle cleanser which won’t irritate your skin. Cacay oil used as a facial oil treats acne/blemishes.
3861 2018-12-30 23:00:52 There is actually a documentary out, it all went to check, when the President at the time kicked the oil companies out of the country. They were trying to dictate to the President. I'll find the name of it. Very good Doc. Opens ur eyes.
3862 2018-12-30 23:00:50 you have nothing to do with low gas prices the glut of oil and gas causing the low price does.
3863 2018-12-30 23:00:42 That's true but they have their reason; we have to focus on supporting our team rather than earlier celebrations .. #LFC is a real story not like other fake ones funded by a huge oil money .. we deserve it but we just need to be wise till the last match!
3864 2018-12-30 23:00:41 I just joked to my buddy, quickly now offer the Oil 2 & 7 for 29 and let them know it will now solve all their D issues...

3873 2018-12-30 23:00:24 @Warburtons still using palm oil bet your sales are dropping - your using cheap ingredients to make your product that’s damaging to habitats or animals - disgrace
3874 2018-12-30 23:00:23 That's so pretty! Reminds me of that oil slick hair color that was trendy a few years ago. 
3875 2018-12-30 23:00:14 Sorry, I meant humorous in terms of comparison to oil industry. Not deriding your other points.
3876 2018-12-30 23:00:01 To cast oil in the fire is not the way to quench it.
3877 2018-12-30 23:00:00 I knew it really didn't have anything to do with the tax or oil or gas just as the revolution or something years ago really didn't have anything to do with milk.
3878 2018-12-30 22:59:58 We do not lack oil for cars. Do you not know, ta2t2o, that the VAST majority of our oil, whether produced here or imported, goes to the Pentagon, which is the WORLD's #1 buyer of fossil fuel and the world's biggest polluter? End US addiction to war profiteering.
3879 2018-12-30 22:59:57 my daughter's kept coming back, i would use coconut oil and brush it out in the bath...her pediatrician said it comes back for a lot of babies and they just grow out of it (my daughter did).
3880 2018-12-30 22:59:41 Minor deals, Oil lose nothing of real value in trades, desperate for help on”D” need to do something, can’t compete in NHL with current “D” line up. Way too many injuries.
3881 2018-12-30 22:59:34 Now your talking . Oil me up buttercup 
3882 2018-12-30 22:59:29 I think cooking it in oil is supposed to get rid of the smell.
3883 2018-12-30 22:59:28 no because they stood by us and NATO when we spit on everything we'd agreed to and helped show us the right way out.

Because they did more to shelter the refugees we created than we did.

Because they didn't stand to gain oil lands from any of it.

Because Erdrogan is one man.
3884 2018-12-30 22:59:22 Thanks for studying this incredible case of self distruction of one of the potential richest country in the world which has still the biggest crude oil reserve than any other country.
3885 2018-12-30 22:59:10 으 진짜 그거 카톡 프사로 하는 또라이는 뭘까요
3886 2018-12-30 22:59:06 We might not be causing all the climate change but we are not helping it. Solar Power has to be developed. No more kicking cans for oil companies.
3887 2018-12-30 22:59:05 はい！良いお年をお迎えください(^ ^)
3888 2018-12-30 22:59:02 Pasadena
2005:100% da refinaria adquirida pela belga Astra Oil por US$42,5 milhões.
Em 2006-50% e 2009-50% da refinaria comprados pela Petrobras por US$360 milhões e US$839 milhões, respectivamente.
Assim, a Petrobras acabou desembolsando US$ 1,18 bilhão, cerca R$ 2,76 bilhões!
3889 2018-12-30 22:59:02 As much as you're trying to show people the sides of Allah's mercy, also admonish them on his azaab so People won't take things fr Granted, that's how sermons are done, there are a lot of Sahih ahadeeth that condemns suicide doers to hell.
People just want to hear d Rahma part.
3890 2018-12-30 22:59:01 who got LEGIT oil pens no exotic or mario carts i wanna buy one
3891 2018-12-30 22:58:54 This is what I read on Oct1, 2018. Falih accompanied MBS.
Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed has discussed the restart of crude oil production in the neutral zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait during a meeting with Kuwait’s Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah
3892 2018-12-30 22:58:48 Really? How much petrol, and why? How often do they fall in? How much pollution do they produce in comparison to oil rigs? Thank you .
3893 2018-12-30 22:58:45 The oil starts to separate.
3894 2018-12-30 22:58:42 I'm gonna attempt too try with oil pastels again... one day
3895 2018-12-30 22:58:38 I feel the same about truffle oil. GTFOH
3896 2018-12-30 22:58:21 Wait, as a mechanic (no, I’ve never seen how an electric car is made) how does it not need oil or brakes?
3897 2018-12-30 22:58:16 I'M TWISTING IT IN MY OWN BACK! I bleed Oil from waaaaay back!
3898 2018-12-30 22:58:15 No, given slavery, there are some ways of dealing with its reality that are better than others.  If you kill someone, and you (for the sake of argument) will be executed, you might be dragged across a highway with boiling oil pumped into your veins, or get a lethal injection...
3899 2018-12-30 22:58:02 That quote is attributed to an unknown Alberta man that called into a radio show to vent his frustrations with the Pierre Trudeau government and the National Energy Program during the 1980s oil glut.
3900 2018-12-30 22:58:02 ylang ylang oil, lavender, orange,  i lovve patchouli! even sandalwood oil ooooh that ones my fav
3901 2018-12-30 22:57:59 I guess there’s some Cadbury sponsorship deal going on as to why dairy milk had to be number 1 tsk! Palm oil rubbish. #BritainsFavouriteChocolate
3902 2018-12-30 22:57:51 Im not attacking the person. I am analysing their credibility The person has no professional credibility. Their argument comes from a proven place that is an opinion paid for by corporate interests. Lindzen's ideas have the scientific authority of a TV commercial advertising oil
3903 2018-12-30 22:57:43 Since when has a crude oil spill ever been a boost to anything?
3904 2018-12-30 22:57:39 Sooo 3 weeks ago I got comb coils to start my locs and it's been a struggle adjusting. I'm finally accepting the frizz but my scalp is so dry. I've been using rosewater and vitamin e oil mixed in a spray bottle and it's done nothing. I'm stressed 
3905 2018-12-30 22:57:20 Trudeaus climate change he buys oil from Saudi they ship it in poluting ships.Canada could by pipeline ship and refine canads oil.

3908 2018-12-30 22:56:59 The #TrumpCrimeFamily is missing the empathy gene.
He likes oil money & hates reading.
3909 2018-12-30 22:56:59 You have zero self-respect for blatantly repeating Ford’s lies. What lies are you going to repeat when the price of oil, which is controlled by the stock market, rises substantially?

3911 2018-12-30 22:56:41 We pay the Feds based on what was devised when @stephenharper & @jkenney were in Ottawa.

#Alberta does not send money to #Quebec 

Yes, we should diversify our ag - we are destroying the soil with monoculture crops & Round Up saturation. 

In ag & oil we are all about $ today.
3912 2018-12-30 22:56:36 Replace butter with olive oil
3913 2018-12-30 22:56:26 I’ve never used any sort of tan in my life and Laura helped me buy an oil which is so minor but the stress I’m feeling is unreal
3914 2018-12-30 22:56:20 はーいです。
良いお年をです。
3915 2018-12-30 22:56:18 I went to the grocery and forgot to buy olive oil what a rookie mistake
3916 2018-12-30 22:56:10 This idea that you can make war on the West while still trading with it, much less being completely dependent on it, never held merit.

Like Russia & other oil-and-gas-export-dependent nations, China missed how much the US & her allies did for them everyday.
3917 2018-12-30 22:56:02 Dairy Milk is now a palm oil tasteless piece of brown. So bastardised by Kraft it doesn't have the right to have milk in the name. #BritainsFavouriteChocolate
3918 2018-12-30 22:56:00 Did any of the top 20 not contain palm oil?  #BritainsFavouriteChocolate
3919 2018-12-30 22:55:56 The Current Plan for Syria is just plain old flat out Down Right Stupid.  It will NEVER work.

To say the Turks will take up the fight against the ISIS actually ONLY sells out to the Whole Sale Slaughter of Kurds, while gaining the Access and Control of Syrian Oil.

Point Blank.
3920 2018-12-30 22:55:38 That's what is preventing our ancestors since the eighties. Abeg if possible no palm oil 
3921 2018-12-30 22:55:38 And don’t forget that shale oil can’t generate free cash flow. Many companies are loaded up on debt that can’t be paid back. Expect oil prices to crash first before skyrocketing
3922 2018-12-30 22:55:29 Dairy Milk tastes foul now, just tastes like oil 
3923 2018-12-30 22:55:22 So pleased you are brighter an back on twitter.
I am looking forward to tomorrow too....then we have to wait until the 2nd January ....really getting exciting now..
3924 2018-12-30 22:55:17 My favorite: the REVIEWS of a recipe that are like “this recipe was so dry. I substituted wood shavings for the oil and left out the eggs”
3925 2018-12-30 22:55:13 Yes let us ignore the oil and gas...

3931 2018-12-30 22:54:40 I think it's a Steroid that gives you the "Trembles"

But I Refuse to Look it Up.

Sounds Weesh & probably contains soy Oil.
3932 2018-12-30 22:54:40 What exactly are we exporting that we can use to substitute half of what was banned outside oil and raw materials that we will import again as finished goods at a higher value than we exported. All still turns out to be leakage to the economy from my perspective.

3938 2018-12-30 22:54:16 Two remedies I use when my vertigo kicks in, Dramamine and Divertigo. Divertigo is an oil that goes behind the ear, keep your head also at a 90 degree angle. It totally stinks. My episodes can last up to 6 weeks. Feel better soon

3951 2018-12-30 22:52:34 A good start would be to handover any belongings you have that involve the industrial revolution and the use of oil, coal, plastic etc. See what you have left.
3952 2018-12-30 22:52:32 Had nothing to do with fuel mixture.  Had everything to do with molasses thick oil that can't pass through small clearances, like rod and crank bearings
3953 2018-12-30 22:52:32 I’m driving 1700 miles over the next two days. RIP to my back, my playlists, and the brand new oil change.

TAKE OFF Qヒットおめでとうございます
3955 2018-12-30 22:52:20 What is your opinion on the effect of Brexit on the oil industry in the western Sahara, brian?
3956 2018-12-30 22:52:13 £35k just about covers two secondhand Transit vans! Perhaps they have a cunning plan to strap on empty oil drums and float them to and from the Belgium 
3957 2018-12-30 22:52:11 Good clean well paying jobs! It's a start, more tax dollars. Tech companies are moving into the South. They need educated well trained workers. Retraining people with jobs in coal, oil etc to do new better jobs. Something?!

3964 2018-12-30 22:51:23 I hate being an oilers fan sometimes  how this trade didn’t get vetoed by any one of pc’s superiors shows why this organization is such a shit show.
3965 2018-12-30 22:51:13 Minding yo business pulling from work and all of a sudden you hear baby oil and cheeks getting smashed . I’d die 
3966 2018-12-30 22:51:06 Ordered this size L dress to wear dinner tonight and now it won’t even move pass my hips lol  thank you size chart !!  now I have to oil my body to slide out this thing 
3967 2018-12-30 22:50:56 Not sure how this will play out but Manning is a disaster. I have zero idea why you would make this trade. I like watching the Oil, my 2nd favorite team. I'm absolutely dumbfounded what positive can be taken from this from the Oilers point of view.
3968 2018-12-30 22:50:55 Try not to use shampoo everyday so that the natural oil of your will stay. Also when you're using shampoo mix it with water then pour it on your head
3969 2018-12-30 22:50:51 @JerryBrownGov hey Jerry just heard you're delusional rant about global warming on Meet the Press get with the times crude oil was it made from fossils
3970 2018-12-30 22:50:35 witch hazel  coconut oil  cocoa butter
3971 2018-12-30 22:50:23 And take "drags" off their Juul pen filled with soy Oil.

I don't even know what a "Juul pen" Even is

I refuse to Look it Up. This is probably the correct Context however.

Based on Weesh noises I have Overheard while practicing Nightlife Generalship.
3972 2018-12-30 22:50:15 I need a oil pad
3973 2018-12-30 22:50:09 Tell you what. To prepare for the tragic eventuality that Rex is ever garotted & dismembered by order of murderous theocrats while travelling on assignment, I'll prepare a think-piece arguing that we've no reason to grieve over-much since Rex was an alcoholic Big Oil shill. Cool?
3974 2018-12-30 22:49:49 The oil industry has been onside with the #Alberta climate plan since it was introduced.
That plan includes a carbon tax which is one of the easiest ways to reduce emissions. 
Maybe #Scheer 
Where is your plan Andrew?

3975 2018-12-30 22:49:38 Haha I feel your pain. I had oily skin before I tried oil cleansing. Never going back :)

3979 2018-12-30 22:49:03 ダイエットしていたって、時にはオイルも必要だろう?
3980 2018-12-30 22:48:56 Keeping lies and false narratives straight over time is hard to do when they don't represent true facts.
3981 2018-12-30 22:48:41 And it still ain’t stopping no show. I’ll rub some castor oil on his scalp.
3982 2018-12-30 22:48:40 Doxy, tetra, tinidazole, diflucan, oil of oregano, artemisinin, mepron, monolaurin, valcyclovir
3983 2018-12-30 22:48:38 They want to invent conflicts to distract from the issues. They don't want to talk about Beto's Republican friendly voting record or that he has taken millions from big pharma, insurance companies and big oil. That's the last thing they wanna talk about.
3984 2018-12-30 22:48:30 Apologies to Mr. @BrokeAssTeacher! We’re currently snarfing goldfish crackers, for what it’s worth. No truffle oil in sight.
3985 2018-12-30 22:48:30 Dusty great job at the Spengler. Have a knack for calling games. Any idea how this improves the oil? Trade 3rd and cagguila for two dmen who have been scratched in 8/9 of their teams games recently ?
3986 2018-12-30 22:48:27 My New Years resolution is to get an oil change

3989 2018-12-30 22:48:14 shout out to my homie for being so real n taking my boots off for me and for getting me coconut oil to remove my makeup even though he was probably more drunk than I was
3990 2018-12-30 22:48:14 Oil Trade with ISIS and Barzani
3991 2018-12-30 22:48:08 Yikes. Those boys love a slowmo spritz with that Tom Ford glittery body oil (warning, nightmare to wash out of your clothes actually) #brosdoc
3992 2018-12-30 22:48:06 The same politicians blocking wind turbine construction as an "eyesore" would build 60ft drills through your living room in a heartbeat if there was a single drop of oil found under the basement.
3993 2018-12-30 22:47:58 Hmm... wonder how could that be?
Excess sugar & starch and poly-unsaturated plant seed oil consumption still causes all kinds of inflammatory shit despite decades of denial and pushing other agendas from the experts.

Did our metabolism not get the goverment memo?
3994 2018-12-30 22:47:55 why is this going on when the goddamn country has millions in oil revenue and other recourses. My heart breaks for him 
3995 2018-12-30 22:47:44 As big as you are
3996 2018-12-30 22:47:40 Apparently, I naturally smell like eucalyptus oil and spearmint
3997 2018-12-30 22:47:38 So the extra PM from electric vehicle issue is being deliberately exaggerate I believe to slow down the switch to EVs from ICE to maintain oil company profits.
3998 2018-12-30 22:47:31 Oven dried tomatoes in olive oil with Basil and garlic
3999 2018-12-30 22:46:55 Im so annoyed I can't sleep and I have to wake up at 4.30 tomorrow ha.... But this cinnamon essential oil i have in my diffuser is really giving me lifeeee right now omg
4000 2018-12-30 22:46:42 Texas. He's afraid they'll reject a self-identified progressive.

But Texas also means kissing oil company ass.
4001 2018-12-30 22:46:38 Way to do the biddings for the think tanks, bro. 

Beto has zero appeal to independents and progressives. He’s already been outed as a 3rd way corporatist, backed by big oil and he opposes M4A. The fact that he lost to Cruz is just icing on the cake.
4002 2018-12-30 22:46:13 known as the sick man of Europe because we had a Lab gov, led by the nose by unions & constant strikes. FTD's had only just begun when we joined. We never had full benefits & our economy would have soared. EEC only let us join when we found N.Sea oil then asset stripped us
4003 2018-12-30 22:46:10 President Obama, but don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
4004 2018-12-30 22:46:01 "We can tell the world is being trasnformed in a big way by CO2 and the changes in the atmosphere...It's easy to understand why if there's an oil market, Canada would want to be a part of that market...But that market is changing the planet" says  Ivan Seminiuk on #CCCheckup
4005 2018-12-30 22:45:43 I don't see an incremental improvement towards a sustainable and secure solution here.  It's more like pouring four more quarts of oil into an old car that keeps burning oil.  Except the four quarts cost more than a new car that doesn't burn oil.  That's why I'm yelling.
4006 2018-12-30 22:45:41 Yup, I’ve done reasonable dough for this with just oil, but the dairy adds a richness obviously. Here in the UK have to reverse engineer approximate Georgian cheese blending Greek, Turkish, Italian, etc. Good luck.
4007 2018-12-30 22:45:36 NZ Govt. has banned supermarket shopping bags. Make a huuuuge difference. And banned off shore exploration oil and gas. That should do a lot to boost trade- imports. Then we can all convert to Amish and learn horse husbandry.
4008 2018-12-30 22:45:32 Tea tree oil
4009 2018-12-30 22:45:29 Also, just ordered CBD oil to try for numerous aches & pains which are now suspected #Fibromialgia “Does ordering CBD oil make me a stoner #darlingson?” “No mother, doesn’t have the stuff in it to make you mental, you don’t need it, you already are” Thanks Child. Thanks.
4010 2018-12-30 22:45:18 my skin be like  and frankincense oil be like 
4011 2018-12-30 22:45:13 Well its good to see they are doing so much better today since they got rid of the bad oil guys. 
4012 2018-12-30 22:45:12 Changing my oil with my step-dad is one of my favorite things to do 
4013 2018-12-30 22:45:12 Legalizing hemp is a great start. It can replace fossil fuels (Ford's first Model T ran on hemp oil) and that would eliminate carbon emissions. Think the oil companies would be OK with that?
4014 2018-12-30 22:45:09 I’ve been wanting to try body shops tea tree oil stuff but heard mixed reviews
4015 2018-12-30 22:45:03 Pure coconut oil ....
4016 2018-12-30 22:44:53 Me & you both pika... I even put on extra coconut oil
4017 2018-12-30 22:44:49 "I support the oil industry so much i literally light gasoline on fire for fun! Checkmate environmentalists"

- Jason Kenney probably.
4018 2018-12-30 22:44:44 as the caller says, we do not want natural disasters so keep the oil in the ground and go hydro, solar, wind for jobs and energy. Let’s transition now before our oil dependence increases frequency of these disasters
4019 2018-12-30 22:44:41 #CCCheckup Alberta doesn’t have any oil. It’s sludge from tar sands.
4020 2018-12-30 22:44:10 Be going 
4021 2018-12-30 22:44:06 I dont understand few tweets I see. 

Did oilers gave up so much to get bigger and tougher D ?  This is imo is better. 

Wideman looked brutal here.... and Garrison stunk! 

Cagguila never did anything.

What is wrong with trades ? 

Costed us NOTHING. Oil aint finished. RW plz..
4022 2018-12-30 22:44:05 Your entire party is spreading this same misinformation. This is disgusting. Ontario's finance minister seems to think that low gas prices are a result of cap and trade. The glut in oil was started by an over supply of natural gas from innovations in fracking.
4023 2018-12-30 22:44:04 This all started with Pronger. We are cursed.
4024 2018-12-30 22:44:04 Setau aku gini kak, essential oil tu golongannya, yaitu golongan minyak atsiri, nah untuk minyak kayu putih tu jenisnya, minyak atsiri yg diambil dari tanaman eucalyptus namanya minyak kayu putih

4026 2018-12-30 22:43:50 That's the dirty little secret about all this Hooraying about low gas prices - it's because world oil prices are way down and Alberta and Canada are paying badly for that! Why aren't @fordnation & @celliottability talking about that? #ONpoli #cdnpoli
4027 2018-12-30 22:43:38 Only my child sits and pour pink oil moisturizer out
4028 2018-12-30 22:43:29 My fav non comedogenic oils are sacha inchi oil, watermelon seed oil and guava seed oil. They’re perfect for oily skin. Moisturizes but doesn’t clog :)
4029 2018-12-30 22:43:28 @IamCKirkpatrick Oh man I just read  that you went to school a bit in Oil City. I went to Oakland Elementary. Where did you go? Such a small and wonderful township.
4030 2018-12-30 22:43:24 9% of the nations economy comes from oil. 9%
4031 2018-12-30 22:43:19 Time for an oil change... oooh, lordy! ＼(＾O＾)／
4032 2018-12-30 22:43:11 I'm still trying to understand the use of 'putting lipstick on a pig' This is a rhetorical expression, used to convey that making superficial or cosmetic changes is a futile attempt to disguise the true nature of a product. It's a stretch to link this with EVs & mass oil use?
4033 2018-12-30 22:43:10 Duke's Shorty Sausage, Kirkland Farmed Atlantic Salmon Individually Wrapped, Kirkland Terra Di Bari Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Kirkland Calcium Citrate, Friskies Variety Pack Canned Cat Food
4034 2018-12-30 22:43:00 Yur USA are, is bankrupt! Henceforth the government shutdown! Without the safety oil dollar, henceforth why the Middle East is a total fucking disaster caused by invasions in Iraq, removed and silenced by yur government, just as was Muammar  Al Gathfi?????? Yur $ really is worth?
4035 2018-12-30 22:42:55 Just poured a lil bit of grandma’s fish oil in my Sprite
4036 2018-12-30 22:42:51 I'm not a professional stylist by any means but I think level 20 should be okay. Maybe do a hot oil/olaplex treatment before you dye it again. I also wouldn't do it on wet or damp hair.
4037 2018-12-30 22:42:49 According to Oil Kings head coach Brad Lauer, it is not a reviewable play.
4038 2018-12-30 22:42:47 And yours is just pro oil rhetoric.

4042 2018-12-30 22:42:05 All the while there is talk about ending the ban on fracking in NB to build the Oil and Gas industry....there are plenty here that seem to be asking for lighters too .
4043 2018-12-30 22:41:51 Mi bathe this morning wid dis good up good up body wash and oil mi entire body with coconut oil, drop on a white dress, fix up mi edges and go church. Mi stay nice ino. Real damn nice.
4044 2018-12-30 22:41:32 Frame weld failures , burning oil great vehicle
4045 2018-12-30 22:41:27 The Air fryer I got for Xmas has been a God send. No more deep frying in oil for me. My 2019 goal to eat healthy will be much easier with this Air Fryer. I’m glad I got it.

4048 2018-12-30 22:40:46 Olay/Oil of Ulay, nobody remembers that now.
4049 2018-12-30 22:40:37 Have you tried oil cleansing? It helps to treat oily skin by balancing the skins sebum production. What kind of face wash are you using right now?
4050 2018-12-30 22:40:36 U can't appeal Trans Mountain.. We will have an answer in Feb 2019.   Energy East won't find enough ships to move any extra oil.  Keystone is blocked by USA, not Canada. If you represent the energy sector u might want to learn what the hell is happening before commenting
4051 2018-12-30 22:40:29 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.

4058 2018-12-30 22:39:52 I shaved my legs and put argan oil on my face 

this new year new me bullshit starts now
4059 2018-12-30 22:39:33 Ditto. It was a rough year, and it feels like we are headed into the next season with flat tires and the need for an oil change.
4060 2018-12-30 22:39:31 My skin is really oily so I started using aloe Vera gel on my face and this shit works wonderssssss absolutely love it . I don’t think any oil control skin care product has worked as this and it’s just 3 bucks . Love
4061 2018-12-30 22:39:25 I get all of those as practical considerations.  My concern is that our profession has been trying to communicate with decision makers for about 15 years now, and appear to be achieving very uneven success.  I think the EOs/decision makers are being sold snake oil by vendors.
4062 2018-12-30 22:39:14 Have you tried oil cleansing? It helps to clear acne up, unclog pores and doesn’t dry out your skin :)

4070 2018-12-30 22:38:25 ...over the last year you went from critiquing the price, the quality, shipping, etc...and now you’ve deduced it down to an unacceptable level of oil in a tanker to navigate the inlet....you’re the best man
4071 2018-12-30 22:38:24 Hunter just bought “crayola oil” 

CRAYOLA
4072 2018-12-30 22:38:21 Exactly. Liverpool only where they are now because they got lucky selling coutinho or they would not have dijk and allison. 
Man city have oil money 
Chelsea have struggled since winning league.
4073 2018-12-30 22:38:18 Have you tried oil cleansing? It helps to balance the skins oil production. What kind of face wash are you using right now?
4074 2018-12-30 22:38:16 interesting. i go heavy on the garlic and lemon juice and tahini, so i consider the store stuff bland garbage. my hummus might be more heavy, but it is not fluffed up with vegetable oil that they weirdly, chemically made into a cream aka shortening (store brands are a mess.).
4075 2018-12-30 22:37:50 Guess what drives oil volume in Alberta? Oil price. If we go back to $50/barrel, you won't see much volume increase. Therefore, KEY depends on oil price (unless they have pipeline in Saudi Arabia? ;-) ).
4076 2018-12-30 22:37:49 Sat down for dinner with my english mum and my italian boyfriend 

Mum: 'So what do you think about olive oil?' 

HAHAHAHA IM LEAVING
4077 2018-12-30 22:37:39 Quant à la langue on ne parle pas la même. Le franco provençal de Lyon à Fribourg en passant par Aoste ou Grenoble. Je vous laisse à votre langue d’oïl, petit malappris.
4078 2018-12-30 22:37:35 If it’s surrounded in oil, it’s my kind of plate 
4079 2018-12-30 22:37:34 Sea Buckthorn Berry Oil comes in different forms. The pure liquid oil form which when mixed with Coconut oil and natural skin and hair products is ideal for the treatment of dandruff and even acne.However,one can purchase Berry Oil capsules which can be ingested for internal use.
4080 2018-12-30 22:37:32 Anti-aging hand treatment - soak your hands in milk for 15 mins. Rinse then apply a bit of olive oil on them.
4081 2018-12-30 22:37:13 Man something . Baby oil , lotion shit some water damn
4082 2018-12-30 22:37:05 My first car was a 76 Gremlin.  3 speed manual.  Goid starter car in that I not only learned how to drive a stick, but how to change oil, replace a battery,  use starter fluid,  stuff like that
4083 2018-12-30 22:37:05 oil money boosters here in Hobbs. No other reason.
4084 2018-12-30 22:37:03 No, I don’t think Iceland are using sustainably sourced palm oil. If you read my tweet I was praising the boycott of palm oil in their own brand products and saying how I’m sure this will help in the fight for companies to start producing sustainable palm oil
4085 2018-12-30 22:36:44 Beto bragged about not taking corporate Pac $ but received max personal contributions ($2700) each from every single oil/gas executive.  His voting record shows that he stands with them.
4086 2018-12-30 22:36:28 If you're wanting body clippers, premiers are the way to go. I also fit livestock on the side (mostly dairy cattle) and premiers just never quit!! For any brand though, get a good blade cooling spray (use it liberally) and oil them regularly and they'll last forever.
4087 2018-12-30 22:36:19 A true  oil salesman.
4088 2018-12-30 22:36:17 The unfortunate fact that your car requires full synthetic oil, makes it about $70, cheaper than the usual $98 that it would cost you without a discount through my work though 
4089 2018-12-30 22:35:58 Sea Buckthorn berries are known for preventing infections, improving sight and slowing the aging process. Berry oil is used as a decongestant for loosening phlegm, treating asthma, night blindness as well as heart diseases and disorders.

4114 2018-12-30 22:32:37 You can yell all the slogans you want, but liberals need to fight the source, "the economy". You want to change Texas towards climate change then give them an option for an equitable source of economic stability than oil and gas. No state will bankrupt themselves for your cause.

4119 2018-12-30 22:32:13 To all my PC friends who think they made a Christmas miracle with lower than usual gas prices, you should be thanking a global oversupply of oil instead. Prices are expected to move upward, significantly, in 2019.

4125 2018-12-30 22:31:34 I like to use cleansing oil as my face wash and facial oil as my moisturizer. The best kind of oil for oily skin is rosehip seed oil, argan oil and prickly pear seed oil. What face wash are you using right now?
4126 2018-12-30 22:31:18 Poorly know a windfall when they considered drilling for oil in Alask….

4128 2018-12-30 22:31:14 There is not a real good reason to heat your home with oil in 2018.

It smells. Keep the juice for aircrafts.

Gas or Electric conversions are easy. And WAY cheaper to operate.

4134 2018-12-30 22:30:37 that may be true Andrew, but the blunt truth is that in the urban core of Toronto Montreal and Vancouver where liberals vacuumed up votes, nobody cares. in the liberal loving maritimes they don't care either, except about their own offshore oil.

4141 2018-12-30 22:30:13 @WSJ for the love of god. Bring home the men Why does USA police countries. wait the real reason for staying the oil pipeline
4142 2018-12-30 22:29:57 echoing the dumplings idea. chop that shit up with cabbage, ginger, garlic, sesame oil, fold it into a wrapper: DONE.

4145 2018-12-30 22:29:33 You can't compare United's spending to City or Chelsea. Ours is built on success and the power and size of the club the other 2 are based on oil rich owners... #showsomerespect
4146 2018-12-30 22:29:29 exxonmobil used to be standard oil of ohio smh
4147 2018-12-30 22:29:26 わーい！！！たくさん呼び合おう〜〜！！！！！親密度を高めよう〜〜！！！！そら〜〜(*´ｪ`*)
4148 2018-12-30 22:29:25 Five babies for me and no stretch marks. I used bio oil on my belly while pregnant with my first, but nothing with the others. I guess it all boils down to the individual.
4149 2018-12-30 22:29:21 Frfr they shoulda just got some lube or oil of anything 
4150 2018-12-30 22:29:16 Gas in Ohio is $1.50 ffs did we strike oil

I suck in oiling my hair 
It's either I oil it like an oil factory or as dry as a dessert. 

Now it's flowing down to my forehead.
4154 2018-12-30 22:28:54 Man utd fans are wise 
4155 2018-12-30 22:28:53 but you’re Exxon ValDez slick, I am merely a punctured oil can.
4156 2018-12-30 22:28:49 But of course Trudeau has imposed a virtual oil export embargo on Alberta.
4157 2018-12-30 22:28:48 Gotta try this. I either roast them in olive oil, salt, pepper, honey, and balsamic vinegar. Or on the stove with bacon and shallots.
4158 2018-12-30 22:28:47 ぜひぜひ〜〜！！！！きゅー呼び了解！(*´ｪ`*)
4159 2018-12-30 22:28:42 I agree with his overall premise, but how did he manage to write this, mention Alberta leaders and include Kenney & oil people but NOT Notley? Did I miss the election?
4160 2018-12-30 22:28:29 No sis seriously just BRAID it and oil it on weekends leave the HEAT

4164 2018-12-30 22:28:02 Same in VT. Lots of Oil Furnaces in VT. I could go on and on but been there done that. YOU haven't offered a solution as to why VT is only $9+in VT? Or why single payer failed there. Solutions in NY are worked on every day. Lots of great progressives here.

4167 2018-12-30 22:27:49 But it is a good trick as it was the GM who tied his own hands and now doesn't know how to undo the knot
4168 2018-12-30 22:27:44 I haven’t started trying to fish yet. At this point I’m just trying to figure out how to get that oil wagon quest going again so I can rob the train.
4169 2018-12-30 22:27:44 Gotta get myself down to @epicanjamaica 
I need some CBD oil
4170 2018-12-30 22:27:39 Hobbs oil money. Now... who knows? He said he didn't like the layoff from the Dec. 22 game to Wednesday's league opener, but I don't know about that.
4171 2018-12-30 22:27:34 So, I bought this skin lotion with tea tree oil in it...but I just read tea tree oil smells like patchouli. I've never smelled patchouli but I know people hate it and associate it with hippies. Now I don't want to use the tea tree lotion. 
4172 2018-12-30 22:27:33 Laura is a DoTerra rep. and we have every oil made. However, we are past oils & nutriceuticals/diets, etc. Neuro-toxins in wildfire smoke today are novel compounds formed at extremely abnormal high temps; little is known about how they affect us.
4173 2018-12-30 22:27:29 Watch him on Pot Save America. Good interview. As for the $, I read it was $430000 from ind.ppl. who work in gas/oil industry, not PAC. If you're from a fossil fuel state, that money is going to come in. Just like in WV with coal.
4174 2018-12-30 22:27:19 Nigga your electricity production company was sold under the supervision of PDP.  The crude oil which we so depend on has been undervalued for $150 to $45 dpd. Don’t be deceived by twitter statists

4176 2018-12-30 22:27:13 I never liked brussel sprouts until I started roasting them with green peppers, onions and bacon. Drizzled in olive oil 
4177 2018-12-30 22:27:09 carbon tax and view that the oil sands should be shuttered works like an offset for Quebec's François Legault  "There is no social acceptability for oil in Quebec" + consumption of foreign oil.  2
4178 2018-12-30 22:26:57 I'm surprised there's so little robbing of gas station tanks after seeing they're all but unlocked. Especially given heating oil does get robbed so much.
4179 2018-12-30 22:26:48 I hate When women show up to the store with their asshole husbands... it makes me wonder why they put up with shit that comes out their mouth... Then I look at his hat and it has a oil rig symbol on it... Then everything becomes crystal clear 
4180 2018-12-30 22:26:29 @ChipotleTweets hi! Wanted to know if chipotle uses lard, pork oil or chicken stock or anything non vegetarian to cook beans?
4181 2018-12-30 22:26:28 If we were Europe might be a valid perspective. We're not them and our sovereignty is not dependant on the cost any other country is willing to pay.
4182 2018-12-30 22:26:26 The backlash Chuckie got a few weeks ago for putting on @GOP Big Oil Stooges instead of Climate Scientists to discuss the Official U.S. Climate Report was FIERCE. Looks like it worked.

4186 2018-12-30 22:26:00 I did when I lived in Minnesota, mainly spares that I didn't care about if I had to get under the hood and check the oil during the winter.
4187 2018-12-30 22:25:42 Thanks we had a big crop the year before. We really miss getting the first oil from the press and taking it to our favorite local steak house and pouring it all over a oak roasted rib eye--it was a tradition we had done for many years until this year. Can't wait to try your oil

4190 2018-12-30 22:25:20 To "sell" as slug pellets, not to "use" as slug pellets (for which they don't work anyway) A bit like stopping the old snake oil sale men selling any old thing as a cure for any health problem.
4191 2018-12-30 22:25:14 boring answer: you need oil or other fats to properly infuse, a teabag in water wouldn't work

hot chocolate, though, that'd work. or horlicks

4194 2018-12-30 22:24:58 Getting a "buffer zone" inside of NE Syria as that means Syria & the Kurds will be losing quite a lot of land to the Turks.

Do Turks get Border towns and Oil Wells?

 Trump hasn't made any real new decisions, but it is trending badly.

How can Trump give Syria Land to Turks ?

4204 2018-12-30 22:24:22 I would say the costs to extract oil from the Permian is many multiples of what the Saudis have sunk into Ghawar (on a per barrel basis). Drives me nuts when I read pieces like this that never mention costs.

4207 2018-12-30 22:24:04 Nothing knocks home the xenophobia like reminding people of the brown people invasion in England , fleeing the remnants of the dollar oil protection racket bombs our military used , or we sold to their neighbours for genocide.

4209 2018-12-30 22:24:01 .@chucktodd didn't even graduate college, and now he's the arbiter of scientific fact or fiction?  Yep, that makes sense.  Does he not understand that the MODELS are written by HUMAN PROGRAMMERS?  There's no FACTUAL evidence (other than heat measurements taken in parking lots).

4224 2018-12-30 22:22:38 War on oil land only disrupt the production dipshit, and drive the oil price UP! Making the people more poor and more dependant on government handouts.
4225 2018-12-30 22:22:25 Just use coconut oil as makeup remover then wipe your face with witch hazel to remove extra oils !! This works as face wash too 
It’s how I clean my skin :’))

4234 2018-12-30 22:21:30 - dont touch your face, it spreads oil which induces pimples
- eat more dairy + seafood it helps make your butt bigger (not that it need to be )
- eating more meat + protein can induce bigger breasts (not that they need to he bigger )
4235 2018-12-30 22:21:21 No, but it helped. And don’t forget North Sea oil, which was the biggest windfall that lucked out for the 1979 government. Your historical and economic ignorance is breathtaking.
4236 2018-12-30 22:21:18 I use the 3-6-9 also, and I use ground flaxseed in a lot of my meals, especially when I bake gluten-free blueberry muffins. I like non GMO coconut oil, too... Don't use it a lot in cooking, raises bad cholesterol...

4253 2018-12-30 22:19:55 Um... not everyone uses olive oil when cooking chicken breast. I mean - most “health conscious” ppl that choose chicken breast over red meat for diet are aware of the nutritional values and don’t eff up their macros by adding something bizarre like olive oil to the food item
4254 2018-12-30 22:19:54 People can make fun of the Green party all they want but the joke is on them. The Conservative & NDP govt. of past/present have not done all that great of a job running Alberta, especially the oil industry, its a mess. Yet you people will vote for them and the cycle continues.

4257 2018-12-30 22:19:39 yes when tony goes away on missions chenle sneaks into his workshop and plays with the bots in his dad’s shirt, it has oil over it but it reminds him of tony :(
4258 2018-12-30 22:19:33 good god. i thought it was about oil. any excuse to be a racist i guess.
4259 2018-12-30 22:19:01 Agreed.  Hydrogen is a sham.  In the U.S. they're literally using coal to produce it.  People need to stop buying empty promises and pay attention to what is actually happening, in the real world, not their Green Fantasy world full of snake oil salesmen.
4260 2018-12-30 22:19:01 Modern technology offers many new possibilities in the snake oil industry.

4265 2018-12-30 22:18:41 Another oil guy trying to scare people from turning to clean renewable energy to line your pockets. Put the money you’re using to promote this BS propaganda and invest in clean energy. What a joke. Either you have no kids or don’t care about the planet you will leave them.
4266 2018-12-30 22:18:37 
4267 2018-12-30 22:18:34 I think the vast majority of cdns have a tremendous respect for farmers, construction workers, oil works etc.
4268 2018-12-30 22:18:30 He wants higher oil prices?

4272 2018-12-30 22:18:11 Janis, I had my business in Alberta for 12 yrs. The attitude has never changed.... people have been convinced it is the land of milk, honey and oil and in the past/present have ignored changes. Sad. It is NOT Texas Canada and fossil fuels are on their way out. Period.

4275 2018-12-30 22:18:05 Even backup protection clears faults in less than a second.  After the actual fault happened and cleared there should be no more electrical energy involved. 

Unfortunately at that point it’s likely oil and bus work that are burning.

4276 2018-12-30 22:17:49 Maybe we should wait till the middle east empties into Europe, then we'll all move en bloc to the middle east. We'll have non stop sunshine and all the oil. Win win.
4277 2018-12-30 22:17:45 Let me know how it goes! Unrelated skin care lifehack but coconut oil is the best eye makeup remover and also when applied to the roots of eyelashes and brows will help them grow. Also the tightening miracles of a 30min eggwhite and organic honey face mask

4280 2018-12-30 22:17:19 Sorry, just adapting to Cons tactics. Thought you’d be used to it. In bad taste, sure but I’ve gotten over 100 notifications over this statement calling me way worse and people aren’t getting it. I’m not anti- oil, I’m anti entitlement which is what you are being.
4281 2018-12-30 22:17:14 Beard oil? I just use olive oil.
4282 2018-12-30 22:17:09 Spray that absorbs the oil in the hair so they don’t have to shower

4287 2018-12-30 22:16:39 Oil prices are a global market so the oil used in America domestic or imported reflects global prices.
Just because America doesn’t import ME oil, doesn’t mean Americans oil companies don’t pump/trade/transport ME oil.
4288 2018-12-30 22:16:37 Tea tree oil is such a cure all
4289 2018-12-30 22:16:31 Oil companies have multitudes of scientists that go to work every day knowing their product enhances the global quality of life.  There are likely 100k or more scientists in the petroleum business.  They hire the best and brightest.
4290 2018-12-30 22:16:28 I don’t even understand that.Also,  I don’t know how to change oil. Probably isn’t that hard though.

4292 2018-12-30 22:16:10 So,  the answer for Alberta is to sell all those trucks and tools and train to work at WalMart and Tim Hortons?  You planning to heat your home with feathers?  Or Saudi OIL purchased from the USA?
4293 2018-12-30 22:15:58 I’m so glad I know my hair . My hair was so crunchy and dry and was just shedding like crazy. I did a hit oil treatment and a protein treatment and I had little to no shedding and now it’s soft and oiled . I’m at my happy place .
4294 2018-12-30 22:15:41 Oh I know their afraid to lose money.. Scared cats..  But I know when you do get a chance in either class you would #dominate

4298 2018-12-30 22:15:01 Harpers alliances with  corporate and republiklan interest basically assured the oil sands would be beholden to their interest for the price of construction. Difficult for @JustinTrudeau to turn back time and wish he had the *spell* for oil futures.
4299 2018-12-30 22:15:00 I’m loyal to the oil.
4300 2018-12-30 22:14:58 Thank you.  The Betty crocker mix I don't get here in Germany.  But I will try the coconut oil the next time.

4302 2018-12-30 22:14:51 KEY doesn’t depend on the oil price but volume and yet it looks headed the same way - pipelines will eventually follow the drillers

Brand name staples are also in trouble as private label shows no signs of slowing down, sectors go obsolete or morph completely, change is eternal
4303 2018-12-30 22:14:32 Exactly. Have to do as much as possible to discourage illigal immigration. Parents putting kids in these situations should be ashamed. Good on administration personnel for treating kids as soon as possible and for saving far more children than folks like you realise
4304 2018-12-30 22:14:27 I like smashing garlic summer in olive oil and frying egg on top. Pop egg on top steamed rice add Kecap Manis.

4310 2018-12-30 22:13:27 It’s sad to think it’s up to kids to do what adults lack conviction to do. I live in AB and it’s tough having conversations with people whose $ depend on oil (which is most of us one way or another) without being attacked       These are good people who fear for their livelihood
4311 2018-12-30 22:13:19 Tested one perfume oil. I dont like it.
The scent is not me. Its almost cloying. And I still have it on me.

And it's strong and has overpowered what I wore before setting out.
4312 2018-12-30 22:13:11 Imma find me a dude that’ll oil and massage my scalp while I’m studying / doing homework in 2019.  A dude that’s gonna support my greatness in all aspects.

4317 2018-12-30 22:12:55 The original snark implies Scotland is over represented, simplistically based on mp p/head/pop.
Scotland = 33% of uk landmass/ 8% of pop/ well over 8% of resources (food, water, oil, gas, energy etc).
59 pro-Scotland MPs cant outvote 550+ lab/Tory so Indy it is - thumbs or not...
4318 2018-12-30 22:12:45 SORRY. CORN FIRST, OIL SECOND. YOU CAN START A FIRE IF YOU ADD OIL TO ANYTHING TO A POPCORN POPPER.
4319 2018-12-30 22:12:33 Early 2004 Oil prices were roughly what they are today
AUD was slightly up on today @ ~.72- .73 USD today
Yet we paid less that $1 / litre at the pump

4320 2018-12-30 22:12:29 LOL, that's the beauty of CBD oil. It doesn't get you high, if you buy the kind without THC. It just relaxes you. It's completely legal.
4321 2018-12-30 22:12:10 Would love too but for some reason finding sponsors that want to fund that level is beyond challenging these days

4324 2018-12-30 22:12:01 Not even being party political both tory and labour governments struggled to deal with global issues such as the oil/energy crisis and a rapidly changing society. But for ordinary families we've never had that good since Thatcher got into number 10 in 1979.
4325 2018-12-30 22:11:59 Kinda hope the Oil add Manning. He'd fit what they're going for.

They are going for the lottery, right?
4326 2018-12-30 22:11:59 Mark-9 out of the Chicago area contacted Mom and offered to help defray some of my costs.

4328 2018-12-30 22:11:38 I been waiting since yesterday to get my oil changed 
4329 2018-12-30 22:11:23 The new reality, unless the politicians start to show some leadership on moving Canadian oil to tide water. More capital flight is inevitable.  McJobs won’t pay much in terms of healthcare and education.
4330 2018-12-30 22:11:19 What can you get with out sending a value plait the other way. Oil only have 3 high value forwards and I sure don’t want to see them go.
4331 2018-12-30 22:11:17 Atink, you're really not feeling fine. Its like your brain is leaking Engine oil. They are talking weapon, you're talking tribe.

4335 2018-12-30 22:10:43 Not all there are oil stocks but they were at one time decent

All companies eventually lose their edge for many different reasons and finally die - dividend investing works but it’s no different than any buy and hold, must be tended to regularly
4336 2018-12-30 22:10:41 i got an essential oil diffuser today..... y’all aren’t ready for the level of Instagram Yoga Influencer i’m abt to be...
4337 2018-12-30 22:10:29 West Media Wouldn’t cover this news anyway I mean how gullible for you to expect MSM which is mainly sponsored by Oil Money #Petrodollar to report the truth exposing evil Arab regimes, so ya
4338 2018-12-30 22:10:23 Bugger off. Propaganda for the oil barons.
4339 2018-12-30 22:10:22 @The_PlugSeeker there's no reasoning with a comment that has probably originated from a pub. Let him research it and come back with some crude oil extraction comparisons, which he won't 
4340 2018-12-30 22:10:14 I just find the entitlement of Alberta oil and gas workers disgusting.  You’d think they alone struggle with market forces and disagreements with other provinces.
4341 2018-12-30 22:10:11 Except you like our oil, wood, cars, food products. And you live in our basement.
4342 2018-12-30 22:10:06 My daddy asked me if I got an oil change yet, and I said no...he rolled his eyes and said he gonna give me money to pay for it. Money isn’t why I haven’t gotten it done yet, but sir if you wanna pay for it go right ahead lmao

4347 2018-12-30 22:09:40 They are super yummy!!!

I use the Betty Crocker mix and use coconut oil instead of butter & a vegan egg replacement powder instead of egg OR you can use a nut butter of choice instead of egg (1/4 cup per egg) but that gives it a different flavor and a slight more dense cookie :)
4348 2018-12-30 22:09:32 When the president is Saudi Arabia’s bitch, of course oil prices will be low.
4349 2018-12-30 22:09:28 All because Iran wanted to nationalize the oil.
4350 2018-12-30 22:09:24 Personal steam inhaler with some eucalyptus essential oil added, is great! Everything feels open and I'm breathing easy through my nose again. What an awesome gift this was. I have the best Aunt.

4352 2018-12-30 22:09:16 Hush Olive Oil
4353 2018-12-30 22:09:11 I wrote "good companies", not "good dividend". There is a big difference here. Most companies mentioned in your tweet built their business model around a variable they have no control over (oil price). That doesn't make them good companies.
4354 2018-12-30 22:09:04 The only (non-olive) cooking oil I have ever bought is Mazola, a decision based totally on that scene.
4355 2018-12-30 22:09:02 And Ontario benefits hugely from Canada. Majority of banks and govt jobs in ONT. More Armed Forces. Lots of salaried jobs that rely on Canada plus we buy the vehicles made in Ont. Plus no oil and gas and very little hydro in Ont. Good luck!
4356 2018-12-30 22:08:54 The car dealership messed up when they told me I can drive and extra 3-5k miles with the type of oil my car uses.... see y’all in two more months!
4357 2018-12-30 22:08:46 The vibratory tools of sound, crystals, & essential oils are so powerful & coherent that they can entrain the vibrations of depressed organs or tissues. When just the right sound, crystal, or oil is chosen, it reminds the body of its own harmonic resonance. -Joy Gardner

4359 2018-12-30 22:08:18 Fine your both right this is the only way to be heard! So all I ask is come up with 5 business owners names and companies that are willing to pay out of own pockets for this venture!
4360 2018-12-30 22:08:14 Not for a long long time - look around you and see how many products you use on a daily basis that are oil based
4361 2018-12-30 22:08:10 that there is always an alternative, like there's almond milk for ppl who are lactose intolerant, and sunflower butter is used in place of peanut butter (made from sunflower seeds/oil)
4362 2018-12-30 22:07:58 Oil up
4363 2018-12-30 22:07:58 So which sanctions are restricting oil deliveries to Zim right now

4365 2018-12-30 22:07:54 As you approach the town you notice it's buildings and structures are rather old. Oil lamps line dirt roads. "Ahoy stranger!" An older gentleman hails to you and you walk towards him. "You're a new face in town, are you just arriving?" You nod.

4373 2018-12-30 22:07:12 They might have been good on your list, but most of those guys were on my "do not touch list" for several years already. Never been a fan of oil stocks.
4374 2018-12-30 22:07:02 There Will Be Bud and it’s Seth Rogen becoming a hash oil baron
4375 2018-12-30 22:07:02 Man is not ready to marry 
4376 2018-12-30 22:06:52 That's because the Canadian governments that were voted in to meet U.N. recommendations on climate change are making a half ass effort to do so, while trying to maintain their electorate while  the oil burners refuse to see the end game.
4377 2018-12-30 22:06:46 Thank you s/heart, you are very kind. Maybe when my book is du to launch I may ask you to endorse it on Morning Breakfast Ha Ha!! Sweet Dreams----are made of this---Steamy Windows??

4382 2018-12-30 22:06:18 I found it evened out all the oil distribution. Used to have to wash every day. Now every 2-3. But I've heard reports from other hair types it didn't work. I wouldn't ever go back.

4387 2018-12-30 22:05:17 I'm truly amazed at what a great job you do of tracking this stuff, especially via satellite imaging.  It has allowed me to profit profusely in the CL (oil futures) market.

4393 2018-12-30 22:04:57 The Australian dedicated a lot of resources to investigating the oil for wheat scandal. Caroline Overington even said after it had all came out that te government needed to go. Lying to the UN is hardly putting Australia’s foreign interests first.

4396 2018-12-30 22:04:43 The only useful purpose to warm up was for carbureted engines.  Today, the computer can richen or lean the mixture as needed.  Cold starts require very rich mixtures, which causes gas to dilute the engine oil: increasing wear.  Start up, wait 10-15 sec, drive gently until hot.
4397 2018-12-30 22:04:34 It was about oil. They wanted to stop Germans from completing the Orient Express to Baghdad and smashing the American-British Cartel on oil. Military historians will tell you - Where was the first British regiment deployed in WW1 deployed to? Basra, Iraq. We’re told it’s about FF
4398 2018-12-30 22:04:21 I am in the lower 50% and I got a huge tax break. So did my daughter who owns a small business. He has also:

*using our own natural resources (oil)
*ended Obamacare mandate

*moved our embassy to Jerusalem

4401 2018-12-30 22:04:04 World oil prices do not ebb or flow at the whim of any Northern American politician which is why only political idiots try to credit or cast blame.
4402 2018-12-30 22:04:02 That’s facts lol. I guess I’d just be a little more positive knowing we’d be at home given Luck is 2-0 in playoff ball at Lucas Oil
4403 2018-12-30 22:03:50 Those are all well and good, but how about the giant rubber ball of oil?

4408 2018-12-30 22:03:27 u sure? Cause I def know something off of oil was 2017 and I'm pretty sure it's that
4409 2018-12-30 22:03:23 Try CoQ10 100 mg two times a day, and feverfew for migraines. Those have been lifesavers for me. Plus peppermint is great. Peppermint oil, or peppermint tea, or sucking on peppermints. If you can, invest in some Dr Bronners Peppermint Castile soap..
4410 2018-12-30 22:03:19 this will probably mean nothing to you but trust me, you'll thank me later. Make the oil, don't give it to the NPC, keep it for yourself. I'll say no more! but it's absolutely worth it
4411 2018-12-30 22:02:54 I ate plain oil and I’m in the toilet AGGHHH
4412 2018-12-30 22:02:50 What part of get out of Syria do you not understand? What part of you being in Syria ILLEGALLY do you not understand? Syria is NOT your country.

4415 2018-12-30 22:02:38 ive been using coconut oil instead of plant milk lately... i blend it with hot coffee/matcha tea/whatever in the blender and it gets nice n frothy. it also lasts longer than milks and though the initial price for a jar is more expensive, in the long run get way more servings

4419 2018-12-30 22:02:28 Oh ok, you've still got a while to go before the thing I was thinking of. Ok well I'll tell you now and you can make a note for future reference. You'll get a quest to go to Elis. There'll be a sidequest to make some oil, do it. When an NPC asks to use it, say no. Save it for you
4420 2018-12-30 22:02:17 Don’t start with facts.  The liar and tax cheat in chief has sold you his snake oil.  Change channels from Fox News from time to time to see what is actually happening.  How do you like your 401k now?
4421 2018-12-30 22:02:08 The UK sanctions were futile becoz Mozambique facilitated oil deliveries & also RSA was friendly. UK sanctions were simply to dissipate international calls for tough action against Smith & not necessarily to end white minority rule
4422 2018-12-30 22:01:31 I want chicken in black bean sauce with prawn fried rice, prawn crackers and chilli oil :(
4423 2018-12-30 22:01:29 Ginger ale hot tea and lemon and I told you chicken soup Also Vicks vapor rub A  grandma would say cod liver oil 
4424 2018-12-30 22:01:20 今週もゆる～くいきましょ
4425 2018-12-30 22:01:20 Haha you can make your own. Mix coconut oil, baking soda, arrowroot powder, and essential oil to form a paste/cream. Put in a jar and apply to your pits.
4426 2018-12-30 22:01:19 what I’m doing if you ask me what I’m saying is I wanna smooch in the name of olive oil and oregano
4427 2018-12-30 22:01:12 sanaa oil may walwal
4428 2018-12-30 22:01:11 OPAT is like the oil industry. Will be going extinct soon due to better alternatives. Almost the only reason to use OPAT for Abx at this point is a pt whose gut doesn’t work. Could think of other rare scenarios. But most things can be treated orally now.
4429 2018-12-30 22:01:01 Goodnight ...you are a Legend. x

4431 2018-12-30 22:00:46 Stir together 9 oz jambalaya with 3 pints granola. Sprinkle with Olive Oil. Squeeze out excess liquid Serve warm.
4432 2018-12-30 22:00:46 Lol, I’ve been writing about religion all day. But like a fictional one and it’s really not that kinky.

Although, there is a rite where men confess sins and are cleansed with olive oil by priestesses and I imagine people are gonna read into that 
4433 2018-12-30 22:00:44 #الكلمه_اللطيفه شكراً
4434 2018-12-30 22:00:44 I went to Trader Joe’s and all I could process was getting stuff for self care like moisturizer, moisturizing balm, and a flax seed oil supplement. I wore myself out this winter.
4435 2018-12-30 22:00:40 #DidYouKnow? Extra-virgin olive oil can help lower blood pressure, cholesterol, and reduce inflammation. Try using this oil for dipping bread or add it to dressings or dips.
4436 2018-12-30 22:00:38 as electric vehicles become more popular will gas prices drop to entice drivers to buy more? @ big oil ; you won’t

4438 2018-12-30 22:00:27 .....and Labour have been in power a few times since the discovery of oil too. Ps I'm no Tory but there is a possibility that 'Westminster' cocked up here by not saving some of the oil money for the massive rainy day that Brexit will bring
4439 2018-12-30 22:00:26 December 30, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.

4442 2018-12-30 22:00:22 The cost of the "oil" on your life is priceless.
4443 2018-12-30 22:00:04 I’m about to take my time & do my hair tonight. I’m talking deep condition, oil treatment the works. Then ima braid it or twist it. Gotta grow my hair period.

4445 2018-12-30 21:59:57 I agree and how dare they push this agenda! Some Dr. Told me to stop my meds and use CBD oil!!! WTH? Sick of the agenda their pushing and making people suffer!!
4446 2018-12-30 21:59:48 Whosoever touches the deen, is doom to fail. China is coming to an end.
4447 2018-12-30 21:59:48 My boyfriend tries to con me into waking up ...today he took it to a new level and brought out a whole massage table , with oil , plants around and crystals. The devil works hard but Nick works harder

 Why are Canada’s oil patch CEOs changing their minds on carbon pricing?
4449 2018-12-30 21:59:34 Can’t misplace a backbone you never had. The man always has and will always be a snake oil salesman. He has lied and cheated his entire life. Always a wannabe VIP his father was a better man than he is and that’s saying a lot as Fred threw many low income families out of homes
4450 2018-12-30 21:59:30 Venezuela is the best modern day example that demonstrates what happens when you "reform" an industry. Production cuts ensue.

Venezuela isn't entitled to US imports nor has the US hasn't embargoed Venezuela; it still imports Venezuelan oil. Venezuela can't produce.
4451 2018-12-30 21:59:29 I've puzzled for years. Had sleepless nights, If someone could answer I'd be happy. Has anyone researched holes dug in the earth for oil, gas, minerals & everything. What happens to the hole? Has the world shrunk causing the sea level to rise? Is heat from the core warming crust?
4452 2018-12-30 21:59:24 I can't get any, avocado, almond or tea tree oil ANYWHERE. 2018 really is a scunt from beginning to end.
4453 2018-12-30 21:59:18 THey have excellent good taste, my dear!!
4454 2018-12-30 21:59:13 So the Diff Gas & H2
Panel 7.
Does the quench distance cause problems with piston ring temps and oil consumption?

Panel 8.
Handling gaseous or cryro fuel is much more challenging than fuel that is liquid at normal ambient temps.
4455 2018-12-30 21:59:09 الله عالجمااااال 
4456 2018-12-30 21:59:08 1st they are very different things.  2nd Any governing party should know the difference  3rd when gas prices have dropped right across Canada due to an oil glut no politician should be trying to take " credit" for it, it is a flat out lie.
4457 2018-12-30 21:59:03 The house smells like tea tree oil 
4458 2018-12-30 21:59:00 Why? Do you need correct grammar just to eat eggs? Last time I ate eggs I used a cooking oil, pan, and other stuffs..
4459 2018-12-30 21:58:58 I am a Yid. I am probably less racist than Labour and on reflection the Tories, they hide their Antisemitism by hating the Muslims more. Oil they say like addicts while they try to drive it’s price below renewables. Then the markets are the disease.
4460 2018-12-30 21:58:53 Now with more snake oil!
4461 2018-12-30 21:58:44 I need some more black castor oil for my hair. Wish beauty supply stores weren’t closed on sunday
4462 2018-12-30 21:58:44 Abolish oil, natural gas, and all other forms of non-renewable energies and non-biodegradable materials.
4463 2018-12-30 21:58:38 Lol u a funny dude maga man... btw its argan oil bruv  eco-friendly ... u like Joe rogan ? We might be able to find a common interest ?? I dnt do Fox News or CNN, I like the unbiased Joe Rogan Podcast tho

4465 2018-12-30 21:58:08 You mean now the oil is running out? What makes them less worthy of protection, as human beings, than Americans? Because they were born somewhere else their lives aren't worth as much? This is the blatant racism of the right that they are too stupid to even realise is racism.
4466 2018-12-30 21:57:29 Where did I once say I was anti oil? Fuck.
4467 2018-12-30 21:57:26 #India will witness strong #economic growth in the coming year, despite external vulnerabilities arising from rising oil prices, the US-China trade war and America's monetary tightening, the Confederation of Indian Industry body (@FollowCII) said on Sunday. | RT@BengalNewzIndia
4468 2018-12-30 21:56:58 Almost all major indices of the world ending in red for 2018 ranging from 33% to 2.5% while India ending in green abt 3%.This is despite shocks of demo & GST, high taxes,high oil price, LCGT. Imagine what wud b Ind economy with pro people & market w/o draconian Nehruvian FMinstry
4469 2018-12-30 21:56:56 Someone tell me who thought it would be smart to put a 6 minute montage of oil paintings in the new Mary Poppins
4470 2018-12-30 21:56:52 With the oil and gas drilling and development in Guyana it makes sense to put a base there.
4471 2018-12-30 21:56:38 So telling them to wipe out isis, and get out, fix immigration and wall, build in US, Save farmers, fix health care ,get out of nation building, kick Russian ass and stop Germany from buying Russian oil, hire American make more jobs than workers so immigration proper-#Singh works
4472 2018-12-30 21:56:37 That's how things get done. We don't want a handout from Justin. We want work.
4473 2018-12-30 21:56:36 can’t wait to run my man a shower, pour oil on the floor, then beat him w/ a belt 
4474 2018-12-30 21:56:30 And GM is promising to help all ppl laid off find work or pay to retrain them. Extended EI is being offered to oil sector workers and retraining by feds and province. I know it sucks. But not totally abandoned. Its an economically risky job. Oil fluctuates. Always has.
4475 2018-12-30 21:56:30 Lays down on the floor
I really want to replace my blood with machine oil and fuck a toaster right now. Maybe burn a heretic or two too.
4476 2018-12-30 21:56:27 Sitting beside that oil tank staring at it and knocking it is a job in itself!!!
4477 2018-12-30 21:56:24 GREAT  love the graphics xx
4478 2018-12-30 21:56:05 You know what’s really unacceptable? Pipeline leaks and the associated groundwater contamination. The only viable alternative is to loose ourselves from using oil products to power internal combustion engines when we have the will and technology to do so.
4479 2018-12-30 21:56:05 DAY 9 - If Foals could be a soundtrack, which movie/tv show and which song would you choose?

4480 2018-12-30 21:56:02 @JonnyBones that was a masterful performance 
4481 2018-12-30 21:55:51 Authoritarian or not, their problem is that all theybknow how to do is pump oil and play baseball. That's not a modern economy regardless of who is in power. Politically they're experiencing exactly what you'd expect given the course of their history.
4482 2018-12-30 21:55:47 S/o to coconut oil
4483 2018-12-30 21:55:42 In a year from when Saudi Arabia hikes oil prices I wonder if all these PC MPP will blame “global trends” for high gas prices. On the other hand they have no problems taking credit when prices are low.
4484 2018-12-30 21:55:42 Weed oil pens get me too fuckin high, like I just wanna roll a backwoods bro
4485 2018-12-30 21:55:38 Dat a one a dem tpc  to much oil
4486 2018-12-30 21:55:25 I use olive to cook with and take flaxseed oil
4487 2018-12-30 21:55:17 Believe it or not, oil and Jack Daniels is a pretty good combination.

This year's holidays were wild.
4488 2018-12-30 21:55:14 Once more "Oil Tot" your never alone. I ask myself this everyday and I'm 33 years old who had depression since I was 15 although now I'm feeling like my depression is starting to diminish which is a good sign meaning your days of better #mentalhealth is coming. We love you Josh!
4489 2018-12-30 21:55:12 I've had the Pelonis oil radiator for 7 years now. It costs only about $40, and does very well heating the bedroom. At 1500 watts, that means it costs 15 cents an hour to heat a room. Worth it to me! I also recommend the Eden infrared heater. Economical and effective.
4490 2018-12-30 21:55:03 @JERonFNC hey Paul,what happened to the Prosperous Venezuela? Was not socialism it was US Sanctions placed on the country and US,IRAN,and other OPEC Nations flooding the oil market after 2014 which decreased the petro income by 50%, do your research!
4491 2018-12-30 21:54:55 Of course :') 
 Took an half of hour just to heat oil for you to frying something
4492 2018-12-30 21:54:47 7. Baker-Schultz plan has a waiver to let oil companies & other emitters off the hook for past acts contributing to global warming, preempting the many lawsuits filed against them & would undo the Clean Power Plan and other federal regulations covering carbon dioxide emissions
4493 2018-12-30 21:54:42 Our products are all lightweight and don’t leave a greasy feel. We’d recommend Leave me be and elixir from about the earlobes down to hydrate, smooth and tame frizz. Then cloud nine at your roots to absorb oil and give volume 
4494 2018-12-30 21:54:36 On returning from I found my new Beetle 2.0 air-con faulty. It costs me RM310 to refill gas, oil and silicone wiper.
4495 2018-12-30 21:54:32 Oil paint is pretty cheap compared to the cost of finished paintings!
4496 2018-12-30 21:54:26 #BritainsFavouriteChocolate Nearly all contain palm oil. Deforestation disaster. 
4497 2018-12-30 21:54:21 Dem fish oil burps tho

4502 2018-12-30 21:53:42 Mehn. Dawan was one dance too much. Women can raise a man's hopes all the way up and then crash it like oil price. I already had very good plans for the days to come but her demons showed up. Tragic 
4503 2018-12-30 21:53:38 Think you’ll find North Sea oil helped too..... #brexit
4504 2018-12-30 21:53:32 Right. Many of those packages include an oil cooler, which a dealer installed accessory won’t give you. Cc: @Boston_Auto
4505 2018-12-30 21:53:06 In reality oil is not on the rise, OPEC has lost its grip on the oil price and things are not going to change soon. You keep saying bring oil back.. it is not coming back! What is your plan to bring new and diversified industries?
4506 2018-12-30 21:52:55 yeah we know the basics like keeping the car full with oil, having extra food and knowing where to go

sadly there isn't much else we can do in these cases!
4507 2018-12-30 21:52:54 For real. A guy uploaded a video on an oil change and ran the bike to 'get the last 10% oil out of it'. What a dick. I'd love to find that video again. It had 200+ likes
4508 2018-12-30 21:52:52 so bath and body works has this new hair oil that has shea and coconut oil I really dig that and it doesn’t make your scalp oily!
4509 2018-12-30 21:52:49 Twenty minutes is fine.  Three hours is not, as the lower temps allow condensation water build up in the oil.
4510 2018-12-30 21:52:49 Jim “vote...”,

Bernie doesn’t need to be a scientist
Major scientists all over the world have confirmed this

Do you get your info from Trump or from FauxNews?

Are you a true climate change denier, or just a stubborn Trumpanut?

Trump sold EPA to oil& coal & OK’s “Clean coal”
4511 2018-12-30 21:52:46 It’s two way of living life and sipping oil and smoking weed going to the booty club or club ain’t it I’m trying to take trips to different country’s
4512 2018-12-30 21:52:34 that is bloody genius.....
now get ready to sing....concentrate.
4513 2018-12-30 21:51:43 So...protecting oil interests is somehow a great expression of protecting We The People? And what exactly did America do in Cuba that directly prevented the launch of a nuclear warhead?

You're presenting arguments based on proposed guesses of worse case scenarios...not facts.

4515 2018-12-30 21:51:28 Today I'm going to write a postcard to my newly elected US Congresswoman asking her to take a stronger stance on climate change and commit to the #GreenNewDeal, and to Virginia government to cancel the polluting oil compressor through a poor & majority Black community #UnionHill
4516 2018-12-30 21:51:25 Without looking to closely, it looks like you're drinking tire oil/cleaner or something, lol
4517 2018-12-30 21:51:18 185 degrees, 25-30 minutes each side. Take it out and let rest while canola oil in a frying pan starts to smoke. 50-60 seconds in the pan each side and the edges. Perfecto. <3
4518 2018-12-30 21:51:09 Things we're (hopefully) leaving in 2018:

- the terms "lady boss" and "girl boss"
- beauty influencers recommending you put coconut oil on your face (STOP IT)
- Vienna sausages
- hustle/grind culture
- pregnancy discrimination (not likely)
4519 2018-12-30 21:51:00 i've got a big dream: get paid to recite talking points for oil barons 

this lil' ol' idealist really just wants one thing: material wealth and insulation from the growing mob of working poor 
4520 2018-12-30 21:50:30 I just raided my freezer and fridge and literally I have nothing that is supposed to be like meat that doesn’t have soy  the seitan I have has soybean oil in it but you may be able to find some that doesn’t have soy!! Are you allergic,
4521 2018-12-30 21:50:29 Do you buy duck fat like oil from the store?
4522 2018-12-30 21:50:24 Fanny  Hmm  Now theres a thought!!  A slip of the fingers eh---must learn to proof read----or those cunning linguists muffed it again
4523 2018-12-30 21:50:17 Who pays you? Putin? Oil firms?
4524 2018-12-30 21:49:53 It’s clear we will he working more with Australia - Guyana to Aus is far closer..... then there’s the falklands and it’s oil. And Brazil proximity as an ally. 3/
4525 2018-12-30 21:49:45 Viscous? Like motor oil or vegetable oil? Or other fluids?
4526 2018-12-30 21:49:26 Ok, we are officially no longer friends... lol Seriously?! Spinach and broccoli is THE best! With some olive oil and garlic?! Can't beat it! Don't tell me...you are someone who likes pineapple on theirs...
4527 2018-12-30 21:49:10 No, the US military and trade power does, try and trade some oil for Euros or “North African  gold backed currency” and see what happens, serious nievite in the BTC crowd. “Useful idiots” and we thank you for your service.

4532 2018-12-30 21:48:24 So they either need to persuade regulators or take it from their own regulated profit. Also you can imagine scenarios where big oil lobbies to block ratepayer backed promotions.
4533 2018-12-30 21:48:17 Really !! And you sing it !! Bloody brilliant....wait one and i will find it...
4534 2018-12-30 21:48:13 Guess all Canadian workers are in the oil industry
4535 2018-12-30 21:48:03 Tomato guts on toast with some olive oil is quite a thing for me nowadays. Somedays with some chilli flakes as a variation.
4536 2018-12-30 21:48:00 The Wolfcamp Shale and Bone Spring Formation in the Permian Basin are the largest oil and gas reserves ever assessed! #NewMexicoStrong

4538 2018-12-30 21:47:50 I so hope you get the vote. Hint, let all the uk get a vote and I guarantee you, you will get independence. Good luck with low oil costs, paying for your medication and paying for your university’s.  Just to name a few, we are sick of fitting the bill 
4539 2018-12-30 21:47:34 Health Tips: keep your omega 3 oils(incl. fish oils)  in the freezer to keep fresh and reduce the fish oil repeating on you.
4540 2018-12-30 21:47:26 Kinks--Lazing on a Sunny Afternoon ---this is pretty good  and I can sing it!!
4541 2018-12-30 21:47:19 @HamiltonFireDep @cityofhamilton quick question where can we recycle expired home fire extinguishers?!? Just bring to city dump where they handle paint and oil?
4542 2018-12-30 21:47:13 This is classic conservative nonsense. "it's messy", "it's complicated", "there's uncertainty", "let's wait and do nothing" . All of these BS excuses commonly conclude with, "let's keep pumping and selling oil". Deceptive tactics to keep status quo.

4544 2018-12-30 21:47:00 QUEM EH OIL MAN
4545 2018-12-30 21:46:56 Haha no I work in the oil field
4546 2018-12-30 21:46:48 Well....I agree there. You are fanny...I mean funny,
4547 2018-12-30 21:46:41 Nice graph. But I’d be interested in also seeing negative externalities (climate change, health problems, oil wars) priced into all of this consumption.
4548 2018-12-30 21:46:37 Oil scenes are my favorite
4549 2018-12-30 21:46:37 Polling: Consensus emerges in climate change debate: IF WE STOPPED ALL THIS CO2 POLLUTION TODAY, IT WILL STILL TAKE 100 YEARS TO RECTIFY THE WRONG THAT THE REPUBLICUNT FINANCIAL & "OIL" CORP "KOCH"-SUKKAS HAVE CAUSED ! THEY SHOULD ALL BE PUT IN PRISON, EVERY LAST PHUK'N ONE !!
4550 2018-12-30 21:46:33 Whisk egg yolk with a tablespoon of olive oil and leave on hair for a few minutes before your shampoo. It makes a great hair conditioner.
4551 2018-12-30 21:46:26 The west doesn't have a great track record of normalising countries in that part of the world torn apart by ambitious geopolitical agendas that service only those interested in oil not the citizens who end up on the shit end of the deal every time
4552 2018-12-30 21:46:22 Next @fordnation will announce  they will start drilling for oil in Lake Ontario in an effort to stop climate change. I'm sure it was in the election platform they didn't get around to sharing
4553 2018-12-30 21:46:15 It's New Year's Eve.Praise like oil.Just pour out the praises and thank God that he chose to spare your life because 2018 took lives but not yours

4558 2018-12-30 21:46:04 Bio oil hands down best shit i ever used
4559 2018-12-30 21:45:29 Poach cloudberry and gem squash. Sprinkle with a touch of mustard oil.
4560 2018-12-30 21:45:24 too much margarine or oil
4561 2018-12-30 21:45:15 I don’t like doing my own car oil change why this nigga bring me to his
4562 2018-12-30 21:45:08 Ok your turn...
send me your favourite song.
4563 2018-12-30 21:45:05 Then relax---makes the experience much better, even if it takes a little longer.
4564 2018-12-30 21:45:00 They also need money, and hope they make some oil money boosters happy today here in Hobbs.
4565 2018-12-30 21:44:56 Why Oil Prices Rose And Crashed In 2018: Last week the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, the primary U.S… @environmentguru
4566 2018-12-30 21:44:55 Oil Markets Brace For A Rebound: Crude oil and natural gas futures are sharing a similar pattern this week. Both markets… @environmentguru
4567 2018-12-30 21:44:54 JC didn’t install solar panels bc of global warming. He did it bc of dependence on foreign oil.
4568 2018-12-30 21:44:51 You better pour some anointing oil on that voice 
4569 2018-12-30 21:44:44 "The phoniest and whitest things in the world cannot be cuddled or even pursued - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
4570 2018-12-30 21:44:41 Because neither solar or wind power is sustainable alone, without the massive energy subsidy of the global oil based industrial supply chain.
4571 2018-12-30 21:44:30 Avocado oil is great for dry hair/ scalp! 
4572 2018-12-30 21:44:18 I will delete it....you are funny.
4573 2018-12-30 21:44:15 Lissen my car was brand new when I got it and I damn sure got an oil change at its 3K + mile point so she’s definitely an idiot
4574 2018-12-30 21:44:07 i love but also hate the smell of this hair growth oil
4575 2018-12-30 21:43:50 حضرتك خير من يبني العلاقات مع الناس ، يحفظ الاصدقاء و لا يستعدي الاعداء 
4576 2018-12-30 21:43:27 Scary---reminds me of an old Dr Who episode!!
4577 2018-12-30 21:43:25 well I bashed it out under pressure...
it takes time Brocolli..
4578 2018-12-30 21:43:20 Guy who couldn’t make the weak Fla lineup the last 5 games is an upgrade for Oilers. Sad but true. And an Oil 3rd-round pick is worth zilch. They’ve proved that.
4579 2018-12-30 21:43:14 Another option is green salad with avocado, boiled eggs and some nuts plus some feta cheese. Also lots of olive oil
4580 2018-12-30 21:43:09 I like Trader Joe’s tea tree oil shampoo
4581 2018-12-30 21:43:06 i just got peppermint oil on my balls and it doesn't feel great....
4582 2018-12-30 21:43:04 @CNBC are you aware this tweet is being promoted big oil?
4583 2018-12-30 21:42:38 I beg your pardon  Matron!!!
4584 2018-12-30 21:42:36 Rubbish.. The world price of oil is what is driving the costs down.
4585 2018-12-30 21:42:35 japa is the code my boss
4586 2018-12-30 21:42:35 For 30 years , fake news and doomsday prophecies have been coming from snake oil salesmen masquerading as climate experts. None of the predictions has come true. Yet there are still half wits who believe it will all happen — in another 30 years of course
4587 2018-12-30 21:42:29 He pledged to accept donations of less than $200 and instead took maxed out donations from oil/gas executives. That is something. More importantly in my opinion is his voting record. Look I don't dislike the guy, but I don't think he's what we need to make progress.
4588 2018-12-30 21:42:25 Unfettered capitalism has some unfortunate consequences - see Rockefeller and Standard Oil.
4589 2018-12-30 21:42:24 Is it legal (constitutional) what Ntuli is doing? So you give me a million dollars, I go to S.A. and source cooking oil; I make $4 million; I wait for my next allocation etc . etc., etc., and all you guys think Lumumba was off his rocker???
4590 2018-12-30 21:42:23 You control world oil prices now??? You are indeed all powerful...
4591 2018-12-30 21:42:23 i’m gonna be an essential oil mom smh
4592 2018-12-30 21:42:11 My dad said we had to learn how to change tires, change oil, & then we got to learn to drive pick-up...4 on the floor. Many yrs ago. Several yrs before I drove automatic.
4593 2018-12-30 21:41:58 I believe he does. I pray more establishment types take up the cause of those issues. I believe even if he doesn’t win bringing them to the debate will help more support them. I too have daughters (5,3,1) I pray 4 their future our climate change plan is not hijacked by oil lobby
4594 2018-12-30 21:41:42 Once done, pour loads of olive oil (after cooked not before). Extremely healthy and gives you energy in a low carb diet
4595 2018-12-30 21:41:30 Oil-licious dry oil spray 
4596 2018-12-30 21:41:28 He had a really good game against a bad defense to win against a 5-11 team. 

Let’s see how he does against a not horrible d before bringing out the anointing oil.
4597 2018-12-30 21:41:19 $CHK should see sellers next week at 2.60-2.93 area for 3 wave reaction lower at least #Elliottwave #Trading #OIL #XOM #XLE
4598 2018-12-30 21:41:13 Gosh  Made the FRONT page again!!  Last time was Daily Mirror when we raided Arundel Castle in 19----
4599 2018-12-30 21:40:46 The lug it but to my oil can just put me through a horrendous 20 minutes
4600 2018-12-30 21:40:35 Now I did bash that out ! 
4601 2018-12-30 21:40:32 yeah I get em real bad I just started peppermint oil you just rub it on your temples shits amazing  works better than any meds I get prescribed.
4602 2018-12-30 21:40:22 Unaeza kuta Joki anakunywa Oil chafu na sio Cocacola ama Pepsi, wacha mwaka uishe tu huu
4603 2018-12-30 21:40:18 Lol
4604 2018-12-30 21:40:17 He is pretty decent in his own end. Wideman is terrible. Petrovic is a bonafied regular, Wideman isn’t. If the Oil “stand pat” any longer, our small playoff hopes are toast. Our injured back end is killing us, as is our AHL quality wingers.
4605 2018-12-30 21:40:09 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
4606 2018-12-30 21:40:09 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
4607 2018-12-30 21:40:07 え、君顎あるの？顎ってやっぱりどこかで買うの？僕顎持ってないんだけど。
4608 2018-12-30 21:40:02 And what’s the ratio of gear oil spills from clean energy turbines to fossil fuels spilled? If you are concerned about oil in the oceans?
4609 2018-12-30 21:40:02 my room smells like oil paint i smell like oil paint and im just wondering why does it have to smell like that
4610 2018-12-30 21:39:56 Big oil’s own data show that anthropogenic climate change is a reality. This was against their own interests, so they kept their findings hidden until relatively recently. This is in line with the consensus of climate scientists. I’d recommend examining who funds the detractors.
4611 2018-12-30 21:39:49 Oil & gas do not receive any breaks not available to other sectors. Period. Subsidies are a myth. There is not a school, hospital or infrastructure project in Canada that didn’t receive funding from the revenues generated by the resource sector.
4612 2018-12-30 21:39:48 Our future depends on Cdns supporting the Alberta oil/gas industry . If not already in existence a great tool in support of social media in this endeavour would be a bumper sticker stating "I WANT ALBERTA OIL; NOT SAUDI OIL".
4613 2018-12-30 21:39:45 Oil revenues /taxes to feds will fund R&D to find a solution but wind & solar are not the answer-perhaps nuclear but until there is, let’s use our oil! Carbon tax is a cash grab & nothing but
4614 2018-12-30 21:39:23 Presido u don enta, ka kar ABU amma basu bar ka ba
4615 2018-12-30 21:39:20 confirmed: leading therapists confirm that once DonaldTrump abolishes a crucial regulation, a sane person assumes he is winning #tiredofwinning
4616 2018-12-30 21:39:20 This is an amazing thread. I appreciate the back story and insight. It’s sparked a lot of comments about soybeans in the U.S. If I’m not mistaken, the vast majority of soybeans in the U.S. are processed and used for livestock feed. The oil by product has other uses.
4617 2018-12-30 21:39:16 Castor oil is amazing with a little coconut oil
4618 2018-12-30 21:39:08 Lol Products of frying sliced potatoes in hot oil
4619 2018-12-30 21:39:05 Bush was responsible for 100,000’s of American and Iraq soldiers dying, letting an entire hurricane ravaged city suffer & the greatest financial collapse since the Great Depression.

He now oil paints peacefully and hands candy to Michelle Obama.
4620 2018-12-30 21:39:05 At the G20 summit, Erdogan presented his proposal for an unarmed safe zone. Erdoğan said the most not to die any Kurds. USA All he wants is oil. But do you want us citizens?There is no genocide in the history of Turks.
4621 2018-12-30 21:39:04 2019 i need to start using beard oil
4622 2018-12-30 21:39:03 Two Minutes????   Surely a little longer  or have you an early start in the morning??  Sorry on the Bushmills Irish Whiskey!!Ha Ha
4623 2018-12-30 21:39:00 I whole Heartedly agree!! He is as corrupt as a snake oil salesman!!!!
4624 2018-12-30 21:38:46 crude oil academy thanks
4625 2018-12-30 21:38:40 My mom oil paints and she has a ton of work that would go with that!!
4626 2018-12-30 21:38:39 @StirringTrouble Alex. I've seen you on TV being frustrated with GDP numbers that Western propagandists assign to Russia. The number doesn't pass the smell test. Well hit them with this. Russia consumes 3,300 barrels of oil a day.  Texas & California COMBINED consume 1,600 /day
4627 2018-12-30 21:38:30 Idk who needs to hear this but people that customize their car paint to look like a colorful oil spill that shit ugly
4628 2018-12-30 21:38:17 I was thinking good old American deep fried oil money.
4629 2018-12-30 21:38:15 you?! youre too Ignorant to be an oil tycoon!
4630 2018-12-30 21:38:12 Me too but peppermint oil not them meds doctors give some natural shit
4631 2018-12-30 21:38:10 I would love to try this Radiance Firming Facial Oil!
4632 2018-12-30 21:38:08 I contributed to Beto’s campaign because he didn’t take corporate pac money & supported Medicare for All. He’s dumped those positions and is getting money fro Big Oil. Who’s zoomin who?
4633 2018-12-30 21:38:01 昨日久しぶりに
OILチェンジ
フィルターも替えて

知り合いが　レーシングOIL　4L缶　2個持っていたので
使って良いって言ったら　良いよって言うので
入れてみたら　エンジンの調子が良くなった
笑
久しぶりに車の下に入った

4634 2018-12-30 21:37:59 I just impulsively spent $40 on a cleanser and face oil + a free jade roller because of an ad on Instagram 
4635 2018-12-30 21:37:46 Palm kernel Oil is a blessing and my skin deserves it.
4636 2018-12-30 21:37:32 in bed, eating chocolate, smelling my eucalyptus essential oil, & crying because I'm so thankful for my community <3
4637 2018-12-30 21:37:29 Yep :) Oil on painting paper
4638 2018-12-30 21:37:26 ...and lied, and stole, sold our natural resources to the highest bidder, sold or leased park land preserves for coal, oil and gas destroying our land’s domestic beauty. #ImpeachTrumpAndPenceNow
4639 2018-12-30 21:37:15 Watching @netflix “Salt Fat Acid Heat”, & learning that the whole point of Italian cooking is “add more olive oil”. Sounds good to me!
4640 2018-12-30 21:36:41 That's really up to the oil companies, especially the four in Sarnia. They are controlled by price and availability because we have one N American market.
4641 2018-12-30 21:36:40 Canada has tried someone new, his name is Trudeau. Look at where that has gotten us. Next thing you should research is your RRSPs  and look at how much of your savings you have earned from the oil industry. Pretty much every RRSP package has oil money somewhere.
4642 2018-12-30 21:36:37 I wanna bake some brownies for my grandma and put some of my cloud 9 oil in them. I know she gone be high but ion want her to be trippin trippin.
4643 2018-12-30 21:36:37 Congratulations to Elizabeth May and John Kidder on their engagement. I am a bit amused by the Toronto Star's report that Mr. Kidder abandoned the Liberals when Justin Trudeau - pursuing the LPC leadership - engaged in "outreach" to AB's oil industry. /2 #cdnpoli #abpoli
4644 2018-12-30 21:36:33 Don't let the commie Liberals take your oil drilling rights away!
Like Chretien + Martin did to Coal in Cape Breton, shutting down coal, putting miners out of work and on welfare.
Liberal devastated CB and they will do it to Alberta!!

— Michele Walsh Metis stands wt Right, …
4645 2018-12-30 21:36:24 Why?  We’ve been in the oil subsidy game for decades. Maybe stop both?  That at least would be more fair.
4646 2018-12-30 21:36:16 Not to sound basic but I’m kind of obsessed with my new oil diffuser
4647 2018-12-30 21:36:14 So he wouldn't take a position that nobody is ever going to ask him to fill. Ok
4648 2018-12-30 21:36:13 I bet 49,999 didn’t go to Poland on tax payer funds, galavant about Europe, then grandstand about the environment. Most of the 50,000 probably paid for their flights and made money working... perhaps even in oil and gas!
4649 2018-12-30 21:36:01 The scam-as you well know-is giving billions of dollars in subsidies to oil barons. Whereas renewables often put energy production into the hands of the general public-and has the added advantage of not killing billions with its pollution.
4650 2018-12-30 21:35:44 PC Gov, PLEASE Stop with all these lies.... Stop taking credit for something that has absolutely nothing to do with you!!!! World crude oil prices are lower due to high production
4651 2018-12-30 21:35:35 Ugh...stuffed up can’t breathe nightmare...one day maybe look up, if they’re not too young...Stinging nettle pills, Black seed oil pills, and Quercetin with Bromelain pills...may work way better than normal allergy meds and may prevent needing prednisone...hope it works out.
4652 2018-12-30 21:35:19 .
Just questioning...

Setup to draw in Federal Taxpayers funds into their personal pockets?
.
Plus, to clear area for gold, oil, gas, and mineral mining contracts?
4653 2018-12-30 21:35:09 Imagine not understanding the concept of Net spend.

Oh shit,you support oil, wouldn't have a clue.
4654 2018-12-30 21:35:01 I also use Cantu leave in conditioner it helps me brush my hair out. I hear oils like coconut, olive or tea tree oil helps with dry scalp. Hope this helps

Кто забыл склепать подарок? Я забыла склепать подарок.
В общем, просто лови поздравляшки от всей души. Если завтра проснусь живой, то дополнительно отошлю тебе что-то. Щастя-здоров'я, в общем, и денег побольше.
Спокойной ночи 
4657 2018-12-30 21:34:53  depends on what you’re used to, I guess! It tends to be roasted carrot, thinly sliced, then marinated. My marinade is tamari, molasses, olive oil, garlic, liquid smoke — and nori which I think is making it slightly too authentic
4658 2018-12-30 21:34:49 Don't get too excited. It's just a glut of oil overproduction for winter gasoline, higher winter gas prices aren't happening. The refiners will work off the glut, and you'll see prices zoom up.
4659 2018-12-30 21:34:45 Yes - Putin is thinking of all the oil he'll drill when the ice cap melts, of all the grain growing on ex-tundra he can sell to the dust bowl countries developing southward.
4660 2018-12-30 21:34:39 I saw that earlier in the week and it's so funny. I wonder what kind of oil she used. 
4661 2018-12-30 21:34:33 And if you are in a fluid bonded relationship- coconut oil is a delicious and quite lovely lubricant!!
4662 2018-12-30 21:34:33 I love how conservatives love to scream things like “free market” or “just let capitalism work” like the oil industry isn’t one of the biggest recipients of corporate welfare . #YouDontEvenSupportYourOwnArgument
4663 2018-12-30 21:34:11 The USA Gov hijacked by the Zionist Puppet Masters has been deliberately forcing USA Citizens to pay Saudi Royals $1 Trillion/yr in fuel costs, forcing Citizens to use Saudi Oil instead of Brazilian Ethanol Cane Sugar Fuel. All deliberate, all plotted.
4664 2018-12-30 21:34:08 Los porcentajes divinos. La realidad: Gas Oil x lt en Uy: $Uy54.95. Gas Oil por lt en Arg (pasado a Uy) $Uy 32.61. son numeros al dia de Hoy. Lo mismo con el gas, macri ajusto un 50% y sigue siendo mas barato q Uy gatoooo. Uruguay es el Karibe
4665 2018-12-30 21:34:07 So the Diff Gas & H2
Panel 1.
Does engine oil contribute to emissions in a hydrogen engine? How much oil consumption is expected?
4666 2018-12-30 21:33:56 Would "Nearer my God to thee" go over with Oil fans ?.. " Cotton Eye Joe" would get people out faster don't you think ?
4667 2018-12-30 21:33:48 I’ll accept it if it exists. Your article, and you, are making false claims about peer reviewed evidence existing for CBD oil as a cure for cancer.
4668 2018-12-30 21:33:43 Ah, mas no Rio é fácil. Aqui em Curitiba, se a pessoa quer se fingir de importante, só falando que é parente do Oil Man, ou do Plá.
Ou do Ratinho, mas isso ninguém quer, não.
4669 2018-12-30 21:33:43 Oh yeah, bc there's no thc but there's still a high that's not as strong and intense. I used CBD oil a lot when I was going through shit at work it really helped.
4670 2018-12-30 21:33:39 Lovely. I follow this thing when i want to get into it...ask myself, (1) does this thing need to be said? If yes, (2) does this thing need to be said by me? If yes, (3) does this thing need to be said by me now? 
Almost never yes to all 3 

Bath oil recommendations pls
4671 2018-12-30 21:33:28 For dinner I'm going to make a nice baby arugula salad with lemon juice and olive oil with some grilled steak on it.  And then I'm going to eat an entire fucking cheesecake.
4672 2018-12-30 21:33:18 I’ve been using castor oil and that works pretty great. I’ll have to try this too, thank you!
4673 2018-12-30 21:33:18 Lookin sharp. Beard oil is a great thing.
4674 2018-12-30 21:33:02 two minutes !
4675 2018-12-30 21:33:01 You're right there, It didn't smell of dirty oil and stale beer, food was fab company was brilliant and plenty of wine and dancingxxx
4676 2018-12-30 21:33:00 Are you ignoring the fact that the rest of us help subsidize oil + gas with billions yearly in subsidies? That we bought a pipeline and are investing in the PROPER approval process so that it doesn't get squashed by the courts again (as it did under the Conservative government)?
4677 2018-12-30 21:32:58 I cannot believe I’ve been charged like $90 for an oil change when the materials are $50 total and it takes 20 minutes
4678 2018-12-30 21:32:58 one time i left a bottle of olive oil at maria's house so i went back to get it and i found her gently caressing the olive oil while crying
4679 2018-12-30 21:32:36 On the real? Wendy’s nuggets are trash!Deep fryers a life changing! buy a big ass package of Costco ORGANIC chicken breasts for $20 and wings for $14, season those bad boys and freeze- fry in peanut oil and have delicious ass “fast food” w/o worrying if a bitch washed their hands
4680 2018-12-30 21:32:33 I don't know if y'all ever took mint oil against the common cold, but I feel as bitter as that stuff.
4681 2018-12-30 21:32:27 FLASH: Total's Egina FPSO received first oil from the wells into the tanker this morning, additional 200k bbls/day for Nigeria. Congratulations!
4682 2018-12-30 21:32:17 I use Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Shampoo and Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative Conditioner. For styling I use Curls creme brule whipped curl cream and olive oil.  I wash my hair 2-3 times a week:)
4683 2018-12-30 21:32:05 Conservatives have *never* been honest about climate change. Their *only* focus has been coming up with justifications to keep pumping and selling their oil.
4684 2018-12-30 21:31:57 Guy doing oil change: That car smells funny *cuts eyes* 

My girlfriend:  
Me: 
4685 2018-12-30 21:31:56 when the USA and Israel began operations to destabilize Syria and undermine Assad with open revolt the stated goal of the operations was to create a kurdish ethnostate with control of specific oil fields and access to Israel.

Everything you're upset about stems from that.
4686 2018-12-30 21:31:34 I need to either:  

- start reading labels before I put something in a hot pan
- STOP BUYING BALSAMIC VINEGAR IN A BOTTLE THAT LOOKS LIKE AN OLIVE OIL ONE'S
4687 2018-12-30 21:31:22 Many of the technologies used in the oil and gas industry fit into this bucket. Synthetic diamonds, NMR, gamma background radiation, etc. These have all had a dramatic effect on our lives and constantly moving 'peak oil' out into the future.
4688 2018-12-30 21:31:21 I am sure they will get there, but to speed up the process, companies need to charge money for Kws. Soon thereafter they will ask any price,like now with oil prices at the pump, going up and down accordingly to how the commodity behaves in the stock exchanges. Open 4 Speculation
4689 2018-12-30 21:31:16 Wasted all those years at a law school  and you can't understand the basics of the oil industry.

4691 2018-12-30 21:31:01 There is no Turkish Empire since 1914. There is war in Libyan. There is war in Yemen. in iraq
There's a war.war in Syria.the British and Americans take the oil of the Arabs and give arms to the Arabs.Then the Arabs are killing each other.Muslims are brothers.Arabs are our brther
4692 2018-12-30 21:30:55 Gas prices are down because oil prices are down.
4693 2018-12-30 21:30:45 Nope, will look into these for sure. I guess this should interest emerging economies with over reliance on oil which could be draining away their resources and more importantly their ecosystems.
4694 2018-12-30 21:30:32 Says only 44% of QC oil is coming from western canada so still lots coming from overseas or down south. On the topic of line 9 even that reversal was a massive ordeal resulting in loads of protests. Its like were adverse to helping ourselves as a country.

4699 2018-12-30 21:30:22 When you are a trust fund drama teacher cruising around Montreal in a 2 million dollar SL300 Gull Wing the economy doesn’t look that bad. If an auto worker, steel or aluminum worker or a oil worker you may hold a different opinion. Plus a drama teacher likely isn’t good at math.

4701 2018-12-30 21:30:13 I hate fevers and medicine and everything except for clove oil
4702 2018-12-30 21:30:08 Chicken would be ok, just make sure it's higher in fat (olive oil or lard) if you're going for low carb. Even keto should be in moderation, but what has worked for me long term is intermittent fasting regardless of what I'm eating

4704 2018-12-30 21:30:02 Government officials (you Cornyn) should not be allowed to take money from the oil industry, or any industry, nor should they be allowed to lie about climate change.
4705 2018-12-30 21:29:52 between those prenatal vitamins &’ wild growth oil my hair done got longer   &’ thicker 
4706 2018-12-30 21:29:43 I have been to the beaches in Rio--Remember!!
4707 2018-12-30 21:29:30 Don't let the commie Liberals take your oil drilling rights away!
Like Chretien + Martin did to Coal in Cape Breton, shutting down coal, putting miners out of work and on welfare. 
Liberal devastated CB and they will do it to Alberta!!
4708 2018-12-30 21:29:29 The President slashed regulations, set by previous administrations, to be able to drill for more. It then leads to the drilling of more oil, increasing the supply, and lowering the price. Before you bash the President, with no prior knowledge, do some research. Support progress!
4709 2018-12-30 21:29:22 Mate it’s so easy to wind up oil money fc
4710 2018-12-30 21:29:17 We don't have fusion reactors because we don't respect the simple angle and the ratio of Quantum physics, either because no one knows them or because some greedy ppl still got a lot of oil coal and plutonium left to dump on us first
4711 2018-12-30 21:29:16 It would be like oil barons investing in another entity’s ‘clean energy’ alternative
4712 2018-12-30 21:29:07 Thank you so so much David. One day we hope to have nothing else to do or say because illegal immigration is a thing of the past. Your donation is truly and greatly appreciated

4715 2018-12-30 21:29:06 It's lower across North America thanks to an oil glut - no thanks to @fordnation.
4716 2018-12-30 21:29:00 You don't need to block off hours of time for an oil change when you come to us. We will get you in and out in under 30 minutes!
4717 2018-12-30 21:28:56 Oil crisis of the 70’s. Made sense.
4718 2018-12-30 21:28:50 I am concerned for the oil and gas workers that are daily losing their livelihoods. People are losing their jobs, homes and families in my area. Not racist, you keyboard warrior loser. Go back to your mom's basement. 
4719 2018-12-30 21:28:41 Yeah, that sounds about right. That’s what you’d do to make it at home, add food coloring to the oil, stir the kernels in, then pop them. Rinse, repeat until you have all the colors you want. It’d mix together in a gross glob if you did all the color at once
4720 2018-12-30 21:28:40 just learned the difference between sealing oils and moisturizing oils, and damn. i always wondered why olive oil didn’t do much for me, but i was using it comepletelt wrong for my hair lmao
4721 2018-12-30 21:28:37 Our public school system is condemning us to slavery.
4722 2018-12-30 21:28:30 I found a whole can of red palm oil that expired in 2014 in the back of a cupboard. I won’t eat it, obviously, so I melted it down and dipped my head into it
4723 2018-12-30 21:28:20 The energy produced in #NawazSharif regime was from furnace oil,,, and it's import is now stopped by govt of Pakistan... We've to face it's consequences,,, but it's good to have a clean & economical energy than from fossil fuels...

4725 2018-12-30 21:27:55 Oil money bad. Soz i didnt get the memo.
4726 2018-12-30 21:27:31 It's a really good, steady high if that makes sense. And it's not strong like weed. Are you on rx anxiety meds? I would try the CBD oil with them at home first bc it could amplify the anxiety meds. It, like weed amps up my gabapentin I take for nerve damage but def not like weed.
4727 2018-12-30 21:27:28 Oil kings game with my babe
4728 2018-12-30 21:27:19 What was OBL's beef? US extraction of oil? If we go green in 2000 the world is a very different place. Remember back then the US was revered. We really took a dark dark turn allowing 9/11 and wasting the crisis on war.
4729 2018-12-30 21:27:13 always!! most of my oil change experiences have been terrible  
4730 2018-12-30 21:27:07 MY GOD. the two of you need some massage oil and a room. Two TOTAL lying losers.  Jesse .......David Schwimmer called.......he wants you to retire your bad right wing impersonation of him. Donald........you know how I feel baby. #liarsgonnalie
4731 2018-12-30 21:27:06 What about a 100% oil diet, zero carb but no animals ? 
4732 2018-12-30 21:27:00 all this says to me is that a. china improved its situation over the 20th century, and b. we burned a lot of oil, lost half of our topsoil, deforested the planet for small gains mostly to feed the rich people in that tail of the wealthy.
4733 2018-12-30 21:26:57 Pretty and exciting
4734 2018-12-30 21:26:51 Oil splatters and that shit burns ! Stop attacking people like that 
4735 2018-12-30 21:26:43 Congrats ladies I just ran out of Aragon oil
4736 2018-12-30 21:26:35 Doug Ford had zero to do with the global price of oil. Hopefully we will see a change in oil prices for the benefit of our world and our global economy.

4738 2018-12-30 21:26:17 Twitter is too much stress. Relaxing bath of lavender oil and unicorn bubbles instead 
4739 2018-12-30 21:26:15 It's very sad....

The 36 states plus FCT all have something worthy to show the world and encourage tourism.

But these simpletons we have as Rulers, leaders & representative are so empty & archaic that all they see is CRUDE OIL & Agric, others are blind to them.
4740 2018-12-30 21:26:07 oh cuz it could be a keloid I got one on my nose and belly piercing when they were new I put a paste made out of sea salt, water and tea tree oil on it for like a week and they went away, you could also crush up asprin and make a paste out of that if the salt doesnt work for you
4741 2018-12-30 21:26:03 when my mom told me how much an oil change would be my bank account cried :(
4742 2018-12-30 21:25:58    Brocolli !!!!
4743 2018-12-30 21:25:57 Sorry Tina I got nothing for that batch but next time try adding a drop of oil to the water before boiling the eggs. Just a drop of any type oil, avocado, etc, helps the shells come off easy. Good luck Gal Pal!
4744 2018-12-30 21:25:46 I cut up the ram today and now I smell like coconut oil and ram.
4745 2018-12-30 21:25:37 The oil and gas industry can be part of the green future. Carbon should be captured and used for industrial scale greenhouses using hydroponics. We could reduce agricultural land, rebuild ecosystems, grow more kinds of food locally. It’s just not good for short term profits.

4748 2018-12-30 21:24:57 Ah okay, so you make a seriously bold claim in support of oil companies without any evidence. Gotcha.

4751 2018-12-30 21:24:45 The thing is, these people are fleeing from countries where we've bombed the living daylights out of for their oil and it's resources, and then the government wonder why it's happening? Utter stupidity and greed.....
4752 2018-12-30 21:24:43 Yes they were the most important battles. And coalition only went after oil fields not Raqqa, their capital. Or Tal Abyad, Kobane etc., cutting them off from their Turkish patrons. I wish I could live in a parallel reality too, must be great.
4753 2018-12-30 21:24:36 It’s cool that there’s an oil change place less than 5 minutes from my apartment.
4754 2018-12-30 21:24:21 buying oil paints and brushes was the best idea nick and I ever had...,so many paint dates
4755 2018-12-30 21:24:21 This admistration is all about making Trump rich with oil deals were he gets a piece if the action.
4756 2018-12-30 21:24:20 Vancouver is the world largest coal harbour in the world, & coal is much more polluting than oil/gas. Most of that coal is US tankers, cut a few of those, lots of room for TM oil tankers then.
4757 2018-12-30 21:24:16 That's the reality of the situation, agreed. Can't fault him for trying.

4760 2018-12-30 21:23:58 One note, not only is it the oil price, but he he sides with the anti pipeline crowd. He consciously chose for Canada to make less money all the while spending billions on purchasing one of the pipelines. I have zero confidence in him.
4761 2018-12-30 21:23:52 I haven`t heard of this! Curious that in this article they say the oil had no effect on inflammation. I`d be interested to see a similar study that also looked at microbiome data.
4762 2018-12-30 21:23:32 To throw my 2 cents into this "what if" game. Without a war (and its wasted funds) given your assumption of minor fiscal surplus, which would drive funds into (inter alia) infrastructure investment with climate change in mind, also including a shift away from oil, McCain who?
4763 2018-12-30 21:23:18 His track record? Hes a Democrat in TX with thousands on his constituents working in oil.  Of course he supports his constituents.  That's what a leader does.
4764 2018-12-30 21:23:18 Are the big oil companies doing this? Is this what all of their expensive going green ads with paid actors acting as scientist are about? I doubt it. I don't believe it's anything more that puffery.
4765 2018-12-30 21:23:17 Not crushed. They're being brought to safety to be used at a later time.

The war in #Syria is not about fighting terrorist; it's about regime change, it's about oil, and it's about enforcing sanctions against #Iran.

Fuck the #Kurds.
4766 2018-12-30 21:23:11 Yemen, Syria, Egypt, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, andany other countries with natural resources that so many governments pillage.
Governments have been toppled in favor of puppets in favour of oil, and minning rights, UK and USA are the worst for this.
4767 2018-12-30 21:23:06 I talked about essential oil diffusers in my last post and I wanted to go into more detail 
•essential oil diffusers are really cool and fairly cheap they serve many purposes
4768 2018-12-30 21:23:06 Boring chopper ride around a terrorist funding oil state?
4769 2018-12-30 21:23:05 Green! Are you serious. I'm a plumber the only way to make green is to convert oil to gas! Then rip out the gas tank. Um hello we can use veggie fuel in oil tanks!
4770 2018-12-30 21:23:02 Not free to pollute except for the oil& gas companies that you just gave 1.6 billion to, to cover their carbon taxes for years, and the 6 billion B.C. NDP tax break for fracking, so the people pay , big polluters get a free pass!
4771 2018-12-30 21:22:57 All of your ads suck, but this is literally identical to another of yours that also had a clip art figure stepping on a rake. If you have oil money, can you at least buy a more aesthetically pleasing graphic?
4772 2018-12-30 21:22:53 How odd. Worked out tho
4773 2018-12-30 21:22:46 Closest thing I found in the CITY is bacon for frying with its oil...
4774 2018-12-30 21:22:37 Begs the question, "What kind of dirt does the Military Industrial Complex or the US Oil Industry have on this Senator?"
Europe needs to step up to the plate and fill the void when we leave,
after all, they want middle east oil & gas much more than us...
4775 2018-12-30 21:22:33 End our dependence on foreign oil? We have no refining capacity in Canada to do that. You are sounding like Trump again. Not good.
4776 2018-12-30 21:22:25 While I don’t necessarily disagree, until such time that he is replaced, the man has the job.

4781 2018-12-30 21:21:34 Epsom salts in your bath is a great remedy because we absorb magnesium through the skin as well as ingesting it. Those Romans knew a thing or to.  If unable to bath a foot soak or magnesium oil spray on your limbs before bed. If it stings you’re deficient
4782 2018-12-30 21:21:28 Everybody wanna blame weed on my homie schizophrenic break because she has seizures. Not her refusing to take her meds.

I cant get through to them that the herb and cbd oil HELPS LESSEN frequency and severity of seizures.
4783 2018-12-30 21:21:14 When the hell are you supposed to put bio oil on?!

4785 2018-12-30 21:20:55 Agree on Gravel. Have said from the starts he’s a 6/7. Was playing 4 last night.
4786 2018-12-30 21:20:45 @longotoyota it really shouldn't take 5 hours for an oil change. 9am appointment time and they're maybe getting to my car about now. Congrats on the last 50 years of service. Guess I'll be joining you for your 100th. Maybe my car will be done by then
4787 2018-12-30 21:20:41 I lost my mum, 3 months salary unpaid, gf left because she couldn't tolerate my depression. Fast forward now... I work as an offshore Dr in a big oil firm. Never doubt God, 2019 will be much better.
4788 2018-12-30 21:20:29 This is Texas oil and gas state. You would be a fool to think that any politician, citizen, or Bernie or buster would serve Texas or survive a state wide election without fighting for over 40% of the states economy. I hate when people don't look beyond their own selfish agendas.
4789 2018-12-30 21:20:28 5 years since I started getting inflammation and pain in my back. Spasms just as painful and depressing as the first time. Experiment with low % of CBD oil starts next week as search for relief goes on. #BackPain

4791 2018-12-30 21:20:25 Like my mom would say: "It's grannys oil that poured inside granny's beans!" So no problem
4792 2018-12-30 21:19:58 We were talking about this in another thread a few days ago. The EO practice might be because there’s chrismation following every baptism and naturally there are very few times a bishop is present. And the chrismation oil has to blessed by a bishop.

4795 2018-12-30 21:19:34 I don't understand why Nigeria gotta soo much much oil and fertile land for agriculture and yet her people escaping to look for better future in Europe majority they die in the sea .

4797 2018-12-30 21:19:21 when we were shopping for ingredients for pizza
we were getting olive oil
and i was like whats the difference between olive oil and extra virgin olive oil
and britney looked me in the eyes with a straight face and said " extra virgin obviously hasnt had sex, idiot"
4798 2018-12-30 21:19:21 Make several small batches and add coloring to the oil, then toss them together after they’re popped.

4801 2018-12-30 21:19:14 They were looking for crude oil

4807 2018-12-30 21:18:44 The team hasn’t been entirely healthy all season. My guess is AP is a replacement for 83. Jones back to the AHL for heavy minutes (and to stay away from all the negativity around the Oil).
4808 2018-12-30 21:18:42 I'd say the same about coal mining, and oil and gas exploration too but a pathway to a #JustTransition is important. Its about when not if and who should decide steps. This may take 10 to 20 years

4823 2018-12-30 21:17:23 The bio oil that you posted in your skin routine thread do they sell it at Walmart @M_xCash ? The one you said use for a moisturizer?
4824 2018-12-30 21:17:22 it is doing bad because you have used it like a plantation for ages, sucking all the oil to please your greed for wealth. The US installed poppet regimes to please their views. You gave them Maduro for they were desperate for some share of their country's wealth
4825 2018-12-30 21:17:15 Saute your seasoned shrimp and remove from pan once cooked. Add 1-2 tablespoons of oil and saute sliced onions, peppers and garlic. Cook until they are softened. Add 3/4 cup of chicken or vegetable stock. Bring to a boil and let it reduce down for 2-3 minutes.

4827 2018-12-30 21:16:56 Defensive upgrade over Benning & Gravel. Jones will certainly be better long term, but you know rookies Rob...they’re up & down. Know what you are getting w Petrovic.
4828 2018-12-30 21:16:48 @Dial You suck. I've been buying Marula oil since it came out but now there's basically none of the seed/fragrance. Nothing but Dial for two years but I will NOT be buying again. #profits #losses

4830 2018-12-30 21:16:45 All the sauces at wingstop smell like motor oil and have u ever had the mini corn dogs at bww
4831 2018-12-30 21:16:40 And you don't see how it could appear that you are grasping at straws by complaining about the money Beto took from oil and gas companies when he didn't accept PAC money and it all came from individual contributors? This BS needs to stop.
4832 2018-12-30 21:16:38 There was a pregnant woman who had two kids with her husband of 8 years. He was living a double life and was about to be exposed after messing up with a restaurant receipt. One night he strangled her & smothered his two young children. Dumped them in oil tanks & her shallow grave
4833 2018-12-30 21:16:22 魚屋さんへ自転車で行ったんですけど、自動車だと駐車場になかなか入れなさそうでしたね。中を見て回るのも一苦労でした…。

4835 2018-12-30 21:16:16 Obviously not but they weren't paid for with oil money breaking every financial fair play rule going
4836 2018-12-30 21:16:01 We export more oil than we i.port moron. Try getting up to par.
4837 2018-12-30 21:15:52 Your oil run out?
4838 2018-12-30 21:15:50 Man I can't be on twitter in public, every time I get up here somebody dick getting sucked or an ass is getting oil rubbed on it.
4839 2018-12-30 21:15:43 The sky in those photos.. awesome...

Build the pipelines; let Cdn oil flow. 
Bring back capitol punishment for heinous crimes.
Deport anyone who enters this country and breaks our laws (including entering illegally).
Start teaching life skills/responsibility in schools again.
4842 2018-12-30 21:15:38 As they used to say in the oil field That AOC could screw up an anvil!!!
4843 2018-12-30 21:15:24 When the beavers follow the bottle of oil, it is because they think cubo-futurism will be thrown into the billiard room.
4844 2018-12-30 21:15:22 Welp, think I had my fill with all the socialism, patchouli oil, and Birkenstocks crowd. Time to hit the store.
4845 2018-12-30 21:15:16 Shey u too u noticed. The idiot is just deceiving people up and down.playing on there intelligence. Imagine saying he will announce the winner by 25th of January.  Odenson

4853 2018-12-30 21:14:21 How about that amazing oil and resin piece they were showing off on Talks Machina?
4854 2018-12-30 21:14:20 If the truth comes out...prices will continue to drop & stabilize at a much lower price than they have historically. This will impact a lot of other things, but it’s all for the best. The market & the economy will adjust and stabilize. Oil will no longer be a tool of manipulation
4855 2018-12-30 21:13:54 Hello, I live in Japan.If you don't mind, could you come to Japan?I would love to have sex with you.
4856 2018-12-30 21:13:33 Get that damn baby out the oil
4857 2018-12-30 21:13:32 Get a hot oil treatment for her hair?
4858 2018-12-30 21:13:21 The vast majority of climate science is government funded. That should tell you a thing or two.
4859 2018-12-30 21:13:20 Spider you and I are saying almost the same thing. Trudeau was handed the oil shock which is about to hit us again as prices move below 40 again. This is arguably a bigger hit to Canada.
4860 2018-12-30 21:13:12 - Better, fire the teachers.
4861 2018-12-30 21:12:57 Best moment of 2018 for me?  Realizing what a true inspiration RW is after Pocono.  True hero.

4864 2018-12-30 21:12:45 Pwahahaha. Uzuri wa kujua one's lane is you know when it is oil that is being applied on you with the back of a bottle 
4865 2018-12-30 21:12:32 Either uneducated or a lie? Which one? Oil prices are down globally. What happens when they go back in 2019...I bet your government won't take credit for that. SHAME
4866 2018-12-30 21:12:17 @CertasBusiness  As you have no contact us form. I am writing here to say how disappointed I am with your new smart system that does not work. We were left without oil all of this weekend. FYI your monitor is still in green even when the tank is completely empty. Not impressed.
4867 2018-12-30 21:12:16 sir that's hellman's mayonnaise with olive oil
4868 2018-12-30 21:11:56 Palm kennel oil. Try it. It works like magic.
4869 2018-12-30 21:11:50 Duh, we don’t place a carbon tax on coal to China, or any fossil fuel to any foreign country, because the tax is only based on the GHG generated in Canada. We don’t place it on oil exports either, EXCEPT for the GHG’s generated here.
4870 2018-12-30 21:11:49 Graham “he promised to destroy Isis.” A real snake oil salesman just like his boss.
4871 2018-12-30 21:11:42 You said you wanted her to sit on your face tho 
4872 2018-12-30 21:11:40 what's anime the. store you'd make orange pokemon oil jetters smell? but
4873 2018-12-30 21:11:29 Avon skin so soft oil worked for me in the Caribbean against mossies.
4874 2018-12-30 21:11:28 High GHGs/cap? Canada is an exporter of 3 million bbls/day oil to the USA. The USA  offloads that CO2 burden to us. Canada is also freezing cold and we endure 2X more energy than USA to transport all goods/services. At 1.6% of world total Canada is insignificant GHG producer.
4875 2018-12-30 21:11:26 Not to mention our need to be independent of oil energy from foreign nations.
4876 2018-12-30 21:11:22 That's how they keep luring people, I'm in Lagos /PH working with an oil company. 
Where are you now? 
Send me your Cv.
Next you see an offer letter and that's when they'll make a request. 
Many people fell victims, borrowed money to settle them and got no job.

4878 2018-12-30 21:11:12 Sick. The Ukrainian oil exploration loan I'm trying to sell has been such a legend. So brutal.
4879 2018-12-30 21:11:06 Cap sun, Aries moon, Aquarius Venus, and cancer rising. I like tropical or earthy scents on me. My hair always smells like coconut and occassionally I’ll use an essential oil blend of tangerine,lavender, and patchouli.
4880 2018-12-30 21:11:05  don't be dumb. Let me give u examples. Brief case contractors all over Abuja, politicians with free money, like NASS budget padders, Bankers using govt funds for round tripping and sharing huge fake profit, subsidy beneficiaries without importing anything, oil bunkers etc.
4881 2018-12-30 21:11:04 I wouldn’t buy NYT books to even collect oil from an oil change on my car!
4882 2018-12-30 21:10:50 Why will they watch him do this , I mean beat the hell out of him
4883 2018-12-30 21:10:42 Definitely palm oil. You should probably visit a local fb page and warn other dog owners.

4885 2018-12-30 21:10:37 What does revenge look like to God?

Release the prisoners from darkness.
Comfort those who mourn.
To bestow a crown of beauty instead of ashes.
Oil of joy, instead of mourning.
Garment of praise, instead of despair.
4886 2018-12-30 21:10:29 Thinking about starting CBD oil. What are some of your experiences? 

#CBD
4887 2018-12-30 21:10:28 I wish I had a garage so I could do my oil change inside and not outside on the rocks lol
4888 2018-12-30 21:10:20 Make my pancakes with butter not oil please and thank you
4889 2018-12-30 21:10:19 え…エルザとは…別に…な…(ﾀﾞｯ
4890 2018-12-30 21:10:14 This will be same as BPs gulf oil spill,  change in way they do things and pay fine.   In 3 yrs no one will talk bout this.  If not sooner
4891 2018-12-30 21:10:03 今日午後からゲリラサラダ油来るらしいよ。
4892 2018-12-30 21:09:51 Many of us have been calling them that for years now, seems everyone in the climate cult and Peta are okay with it but one bird with some oil on it sends them into a bloody tizzy.
4893 2018-12-30 21:09:47 Makes me so angry. What would happen if the rUK stopped buying Scottish farmers produce and fisheries. Who’s economy would crack. Certainly not rUK. They think we don’t farm don’t fish don’t have oil. They’re crackers
4894 2018-12-30 21:09:44 I’m a die hard fan in North Dakota, if my son and I leave now, We’ll still be late. Hope to make it to Lucas Oil some year.   Seen the colts play 4 times, never at home.
4895 2018-12-30 21:09:30 A good alternative if you like oil for moisturizing is jojoba! Its composition is most similar to the sebum our skin naturally creates so it absorbs easily. (Sorry I'm a skin nerd)
4896 2018-12-30 21:09:22 6시자너
4897 2018-12-30 21:09:20 3) We can combine oil with water & create a new liquid. But this new liquid is neither water nor oil, which can be used for cooking. A TOTALLY USELESS CREATURE. This is what N. Benett and his associates have done by creation of this new so-called "Political Party".
4898 2018-12-30 21:09:16 We can transform our economy away from fossil fuels without denigrating the Americans who work in oil & gas. Until we have alternatives, we still need domestic oil production.
4899 2018-12-30 21:09:09 The use of the term “treason” to describe these groups is ignorant, insulting & simply absurd. The 1%, such as yourself, live in a shallow world void of the realities of the average person. You are simply a climate denier looking to protect your oil investments.
4900 2018-12-30 21:09:03 Also finally oiled an oak dinner table with furniture oil.
4901 2018-12-30 21:09:02 Can’t believe Obummer goes to and oil and gas state like Texas and lies to those people, another term of him there would be no oil and gas production better than that the U S was first in nothing with him
4902 2018-12-30 21:09:00 Ai kai oga ne
4903 2018-12-30 21:08:55 Why the whole world doesn’t switch to rely on solar and wind is beyond me. Let it take the place of the stupid oil based economy.
4904 2018-12-30 21:08:49 The idea of a total take down of the oil industry is flawed, but not in terms of energy. You could say gas combustion engines will be used for sport and emergency use. Oil will still be used for plastics, paints and products. The future of dumb,expensive gas vehicles is over.
4905 2018-12-30 21:08:46 That happened to me, so I applied argon oil to my lashes and used a mascara brush to stimulate them, and my lashes are better and longer than ever before.
4906 2018-12-30 21:08:29 I would almost bet that if they bought oil from alberta it would come cheaper than middle eastern oil as well. Thus making things like gas cheaper in the east. It's a domino effect but they don't see that. They don't want the west to prosper.
4907 2018-12-30 21:08:23 England
4908 2018-12-30 21:08:20 It’s not always true that what “the market believes” is also true.  In this case, I “believe” that oil oversupply is true... oil reserves are frequently manipulated to keep prices high.  I think “reality” is becoming more clear that oil has never been scarce ever.

4910 2018-12-30 21:08:16 after 2 bottles of baby oil, 3 break downs, sore skin, i have FINALLY got my fake tan off, happy new year x
4911 2018-12-30 21:08:01 The local community was never willing to be taken over, but Scientology, like oil, has found many cracks to permeate over time.
4912 2018-12-30 21:07:59 As long as you dont use it as a moisturizer, coconut oil is okay for taking off makeup but the residue needs to be rinsed off. The molecules in coconut oil are too large to be be absorbed by the skin so there is potential to clog pores.
4913 2018-12-30 21:07:57 Gots to do better.  Both cars need an oil change! 
4914 2018-12-30 21:07:55 LIFE CHANGING - it is egg yolks and oil!
4915 2018-12-30 21:07:50 Yes. It took a total of 2 months to get my body used to natural deodorant (equal parts coconut oil, bicarbonate and arrowroot). Now I've been on natural deodorant for 3 years, hardly ever sweat and only get smelly pits during severe anxiety attacks. Hang in there!
4916 2018-12-30 21:07:42 Spray de anointing oil
4917 2018-12-30 21:07:32 Oh man! Right in the nostalgia! We loved these so much that my dad recreated the masterpiece cards of Gambit and Hulk as large  oil on canvas.
4918 2018-12-30 21:07:27 A very evasive answer to a valid question. That brown stuff in the picture is gear Oil.
4919 2018-12-30 21:07:25 Moi kebda hande?
4920 2018-12-30 21:07:23 The thought. She was more afraid of Camilla’s reaction than Charlotte’s. Though sending Charlotte to tell Camilla was like trying to put out a fire with oil.

‘Yeah, okay, you’re in charge...’

Selena sighed and gently kissed away Charlotte’s tears. Though the pout that followed-
4921 2018-12-30 21:07:20 I meditate and pray I use music to enlighten the spirit mixed with cbd oil and thc the mind expandes to a higher level of being
4922 2018-12-30 21:07:17 along these lines, have you noticed the sudden craving China and Russia have for Antartica? (Oil, anyone?)
4923 2018-12-30 21:07:10 Plus, the undocumented workers here in Houston are mighty skillful in construction, oil exploration, shipping and everything else that runs this great town of 4 million. He’s a real jerk.
4924 2018-12-30 21:07:01 Not a single mention by Kenny of what happened to oil prices under Harper and his administration.
4925 2018-12-30 21:06:49 I need my oil changed.
4926 2018-12-30 21:06:26 Made from ivory. There's unlikely to be any human formed acid or oil that can do it damage. Of course, I'm completely uninformed on the matter and saying this with wholly unjustified confidence.
4927 2018-12-30 21:05:56 The previous administration gave our vets raises year after year, which by the way were higher than the one you're patting yourself on the back for.  How dumb do you think people are?  Apparently quite a bit.  Sell your snake oil to your base, not the rest of us.
4928 2018-12-30 21:05:55 I was born in Edmonton and was a die hard Oil King then Oiler Fan.I moved here in 82 and became a Flames fan in ‘89 ( my son was born the year we won the cup).  So much more fun to bug my brothers from this side of the rivalry
4929 2018-12-30 21:05:41 Looks like a lot of inefficient environmental destruction.
4930 2018-12-30 21:05:37 Is made with coconut oil ((:
4931 2018-12-30 21:05:33 Uwc mate
4932 2018-12-30 21:05:30 Moo dholo or oil lagalo 
4933 2018-12-30 21:05:07 Global climate will always change drilling oil or not drilling will not change tha fact.The alarmist nature of the activists is misleading.
4934 2018-12-30 21:05:03 This should be the last trade Chiarelli is allowed to make.
4935 2018-12-30 21:04:59 YES. If you like to cook then you need an air fryer. Everything is made in a quarter of the time it normally takes, way less oil, way more healthy, 100% worth it
4936 2018-12-30 21:04:58 He has oil tounge
4937 2018-12-30 21:04:58 You are deliberately destroying the oil Industry, Alberta and Saskatchewan economies and with it the economic well being and political stability  of Canada. Yeah those Canadians are way more confident in their families future #LiberalismIsAMentalDisease
4938 2018-12-30 21:04:53 Can't hoard what you can't produce, i.e. see Venezuela's present oil production graph.
4939 2018-12-30 21:04:47 You can't allow Chiarelli to try and trade his way out of this situation. For me, his options this season were a coaching change or a long vacation. The coaching change hasnt fixed the team and we've already seen enough of Chiarelli's trading.
4940 2018-12-30 21:04:29 If you cannot afford that expensive #perfume... get the cheap one. They are alcohol based usually. If you put on oil with it, it will last more like the expensive oil based ones.
4941 2018-12-30 21:04:25 Put cloves of garlic in your ear, and stuff it with a cotten ball. Also rubbing eucalyptus oil always helps.
4942 2018-12-30 21:04:25 He’s like a stereotypical rich old man, in his flame speedo and with his tanning oil on

4944 2018-12-30 21:03:30 I’m so sorry to hear about this. Ginger, lemon, cinnamon, cumin extract, fennel powder, peppermint essential oil are all natural options for nausea. Also look into acupuncture or acupressure

4946 2018-12-30 21:03:10 We are going to "scratch" ourselves for 3 and half more years, up to our bare bones. How can people  trust an " snake oil salesman", today ?
4947 2018-12-30 21:03:09 Not at all.

I prefer using olive oil and rapeseed oil in my cooking, tbh.

If you think a reduction in meat consumption will automatically increase risk of diabetes,then you don't understand how things work. 

Suddenly bringing up sat fat (lard)is irrelevant.Carbs r the problem.
4948 2018-12-30 21:03:05 Okay she will give me oil
4949 2018-12-30 21:02:54 Just looked at Lidl's special offers for tomorrow,they have it all ,coconut oil,Apple cider vinegar,zero fat yogurts,protein something,amazing last year I would and smdid actually walk in there and buy the bulk,guess will save quite a bit of money this year
4950 2018-12-30 21:02:51 Whatever happened to getting Mexico to pay for that wall, you snake oil salesmen?
4951 2018-12-30 21:02:36 And after these ‘workers’ are paid, all the profits go far away from Canada! Short sighted Stupidity!Short term gain for long term climate pain! Where as in Norway, they have much less oil but a HUGE growing fund, to provide social services for generations! #GlobalWarmingIsReal
4952 2018-12-30 21:02:32 Thanks boss
4953 2018-12-30 21:02:28 1). No. However we require a range of solutions within our control that tackle root causes of failed states

2). UK / NATO wars HAVE ruined many lands in other countries, as has UK dependency on consuming overseas resources (food, oil, mineral resources)
4954 2018-12-30 21:02:27 I don't  even know where your going with this, Kurd here there everywhere.  I think you will find they to are been played. I don't  think you understand the concept.  One divide country into many. Why? Control is easier.  Two take control of resources.  Oil gas. Elite have power
4955 2018-12-30 21:02:25 This morning I had a sliced avocado & two boiled eggs w lime & Cajun seasoning. Last night smoked chicken w garlic butter green beans. I get 70-75% of my calories from healthy fats (nuts, seeds, healthy avocado, coconut oil) & my brain & body are like yesss!
4956 2018-12-30 21:02:16 Getting some beard oil is the best thing I've done
4957 2018-12-30 21:02:15 yes i use cbd oil already it helps
4958 2018-12-30 21:02:13 Lol u need am
4959 2018-12-30 21:01:38 Thank you O'h sane one! Its what drove us in the 90's. EI rates were higher, oil was still a problem, and Martin pulled out 10 consecutive surplus years! 
ALL WITH A 65 cent Dollar.
4960 2018-12-30 21:01:32 So one company was telling people that consuming lemon essential oil is a good idea, which apparently then led to people who were not alcoholics developing cirrhosis 
4961 2018-12-30 21:01:22 since i am aroma oil massaged to a vulnerable, raw base form i will talk about feelings 

only in recent year did it seem like i started getting an overwhelming amount of response to my art and im still not used to it and i get so scared i either come off as cold or humble brag,
4962 2018-12-30 21:01:22 It’s almost like they don’t know (or are banking on voters not knowing) that oil is an internationally traded commodity whose price is pretty transparent. I see their strategy, I just wish it wasn’t so easy!
4963 2018-12-30 21:01:22 When you gotta choose an oil change over your patron bottle lol :(

4966 2018-12-30 21:00:57 You can try to twist everything you can, but it wont change facts #Turkey #MuslimBrotherhood supported ISIS, allowed ISIS access freely, bought blood oil from ISIS, and supplied ISIS with weapons, and continue to support ISIS #Erdogan IS #ISIS
4967 2018-12-30 21:00:55 OIL & WATER

SOCIALISTS & CAPITALISTS.
4968 2018-12-30 21:00:48 Bigger You I Pray @oil_shaeikh 2019
4969 2018-12-30 21:00:42 I LOVE mielle organics. Another brand I love is “Curls”. Their custards and gels are AMAZING. And Aubt Jackie’s flaxseed oil gel works wonders too!
4970 2018-12-30 21:00:37 Agreed! But that's a shrinking %.. there's an ongoing trend where peaker plants are being replaced by battery storage.. renewables like solar and wind to decommission old coal plants.. also, batteries can be recycled but the exhaust of your gas car can't be turned to oil again..

4972 2018-12-30 21:00:21 In 1913 London had less  than Paris. So this is not a new phenomena. However watch commercial  and ads abound for  .  No mention of where the oil comes from or issues of climate,  Nat sec or Human rights of despotic regimes.  Gov is us..
4973 2018-12-30 20:59:51 Thank you - please keep it up, It needs to be brought out, the eco-activists, (like that term), have an agenda and it's no benefit to the Canadian economy.  Too many US dollars funding them. Next maybe look at the tankers of oil Alaska brings down the BC coast no-one mentions
4974 2018-12-30 20:59:46 Don't be fooled by a 38-3 win over the Jets, #Patriots fans. It's all snake oil. If NE makes the Super Bowl, it'll be an abject miracle. I'm talking calling the powers that be in the Vatican to get it verified.
4975 2018-12-30 20:59:41 Price we pay for having an idiot for a GM.
4976 2018-12-30 20:59:36 Which part? Algae was one of the first life forms and it thrived because of the rampant CO2 available. Between the 5 major ice ages were periods of no ice anywhere. An earthquake 10 million years ago spills a billion gallons of oil into the ocean, it recovers.
4977 2018-12-30 20:59:34 Make your hair grow faster : Grapeseed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
4978 2018-12-30 20:59:28 Thanks, if you and I had been the closest of friends earlier you would have read how I boycott companies like Shell Oil who pay no tax. I boycott and absolutely hate Goldman Sachs. Corporate greed and lobbyists destroy democracy
4979 2018-12-30 20:59:23 Who are the other progressives that are up for choice? And let's just assume that the Texan punk skater that loves oil money and definitely said he doesn't consider himself a progressive is not a progressive
4980 2018-12-30 20:59:17 It's not laffy taffy unless you get a mouthful of oil when you bite into it
4981 2018-12-30 20:59:15 Face masks really do make you feel like THAT bitch. Oil? Gone. Dry skin? Gone. Blackheads? Gone. Crippling guilt, lifelong regrets and existential crises? Gone.
4982 2018-12-30 20:59:08 Ya they're ready for talks - the Pres has them over a barrel (oil barrel) with the lowest prices seen in a long time which is driving their economy into the dirt. They respond by threatening Ukraine, talking hypersonic msls, and cozying up to Venezuela.
But are we ready to trade?
4983 2018-12-30 20:58:46 I would knock on the Flyers door too.
4984 2018-12-30 20:58:41 At present it not surgical . I've had physio . Chiropractor .osteopath .sports massage. No pain killers work . Only thing left to try cbd oil & acupressure (when it next strikes) but I'm waiting for a scan to) but all good at the moment x
4985 2018-12-30 20:58:30 libra sun, pisces moon, virgo venus, gemini rising and coconut oil!
4986 2018-12-30 20:58:27 I think there is a serious energy density and recharge speed advantage to fossil fuels that’s going to have a very hard time replacing. There are also some potentially promising carbon-neutral ways to create oil from organic waste.
4987 2018-12-30 20:58:19 Plus the per person debt is substantial up under Trudeau, which despite GDP to debt level, this could spell trouble soon.  Considering he hates oil, although I am not sure, if exports are down that means less $, and a drop in GDP.....and we could just be left with debt.
4988 2018-12-30 20:58:05 But If I had my druthers it would be Nurse for Kapanen.
4989 2018-12-30 20:57:54 Mine too
4990 2018-12-30 20:57:47 If the oil change person tried to send me to autozone I would just disappear into the void.
4991 2018-12-30 20:57:46 If I slap her tho
4992 2018-12-30 20:57:46 Which oil or defense companies are paying this guy?
4993 2018-12-30 20:57:44 Я бы с радостью, но я чёт вообще малофандомная
4994 2018-12-30 20:57:35 Been going on for quite some time .Actually some of those ships are delivering the oil to refineries on the east coast of Canada and the USA !
As Jean Chrétien once said in the house some politicos are quite good at speaking out of both of their mouths at the same time !
4995 2018-12-30 20:57:27 Ha I wish. An oil change? Maybe. Glass replacement? I'd be a joke
4996 2018-12-30 20:57:24 Nope
4997 2018-12-30 20:57:20 I think you forget that there is more workers out there that just don’t work in the Alberta oil and gas sector.
4998 2018-12-30 20:57:05 Who do you think is destroying our oil industry? I cant skip a work day but those protesters spend months there. Who is financing them? Friends?
4999 2018-12-30 20:57:04 Heck yeah! Or even coconut oil!
5000 2018-12-30 20:56:58 If you fly in a private jet for your daily commute when you could just drive, you might be a Leech on the ass of humanity selling snake oil to morons to prop up your carbon incinerating lifestyle.
5001 2018-12-30 20:56:41 Sharia Law cannot tolerate the American Constitution. Its like trying to mix oil and water together.
5002 2018-12-30 20:56:28 あとゴブロで揃うやん
5003 2018-12-30 20:56:26 If I retweet this I curse my timeline with Hillary's picture... I don't have many followers but I also don't hate them.
5004 2018-12-30 20:56:22 I like to believe Enji has a tanning booth in his house and office just to lube up in oil before he goes on patrol
5005 2018-12-30 20:56:21 Does it work and where do you get flax oil?

5008 2018-12-30 20:55:50 They converted an NG pipeline into oil which opened things up.  Believe it’s called sunrise pipeline I believe.
5009 2018-12-30 20:55:15 *as good as oil fried
5010 2018-12-30 20:55:12 Dying for some hot tomato oil from @Pastabilities82. My Cuse peeps know what I’m talking about.
5011 2018-12-30 20:55:02 when the air fryer chicken come out as oil fried and u ain’t get burned once
5012 2018-12-30 20:54:59 I did. Keep telling the truth.
5013 2018-12-30 20:54:59 well there's stat boosts to *'ing them up, but they also take more oil to run, so if you play a lot you may run out of oil, but if you don't have any issue with that then LB them for the boosts
5014 2018-12-30 20:54:59 Oga nice drop
5015 2018-12-30 20:54:56 Ha, ha, ha. What a joke. Chopping down forests, killing habitats to monocrop the heck out of the land, taking everything and putting nothing back in, filling the land (and rivers) with oil based fertiliser and pestisides. Yeah, sure, sounds like exactly what the earth needs.
5016 2018-12-30 20:54:49 At least a free oil change
5017 2018-12-30 20:54:49 Everyone who wants Evans out feel free to call any of the Russian Oligarchs or Saudi oil tycoons in your contacts, the guy (who saved the club) has already said he’ll sell to the right buying for the benefit of the club.
5018 2018-12-30 20:54:47 My street is closed down already.
5019 2018-12-30 20:54:30 Bosnia was for oil? Gaddafi was for oil? So, which democratic president has toppled a foreign government for oil profits lately?
5020 2018-12-30 20:54:24 China's also not buying U.S. crude oil.
5021 2018-12-30 20:54:17 So for your information. Saudia Arabia is going to invest in Oil industry in Gawadar. The same Gawadar which Is a pain in the a... of Indians. Same USE is going to invert in paksitan. The same Burj Kahlifa was covered  in Green lights on 14th August.
5022 2018-12-30 20:54:04 Most acknowledge climate change, but energy poverty is not the solution, with Canada being a leading resource country with highest production standards, shutting down the industry is not the solution. Canada should be competing down to USD 0/bbl WTI!! Til the day OIL is replaced!
5023 2018-12-30 20:53:56 I’m a bit of a scent junkie, so I have more, but this is s a good sampling across scent moods and budgets and not everyone does oil blends, but that’s my absolute favorite thing to do to smell good. I can’t feel sexy or confident unless I feel like I smell great.
5024 2018-12-30 20:53:49 It's amazing what a new manager brings to man United oil doing a brilliant job,  he's so good he's earned the man United job.
5025 2018-12-30 20:53:43 OMG. Is she saying people can change, and that is the defense? I'm sorry, but isn't this organization and alot of this movement built on bringing up stuff from eons ago and holding peoples feet to the boiling oil? This is a spectacular irony. Sounds like "leadership" to me.
5026 2018-12-30 20:53:22 危ないところでしたね。パンツがなければ○袋が切れるところでしたね！←なんで？(笑)
5027 2018-12-30 20:53:06 I guess @realJfred7 and @dadsman had no facts to backup their vague koolade-spiced rhetoric. Sen McCain was the last of the TRUE Lincoln's party republicans. He wasn't owing to big oil or other corporate dark money, so his service was fair and just and for the people.
5028 2018-12-30 20:52:55 I don't know in which country you live, but Iran will not bring a brighter future, 
After the lifting of sanctions under Obama, billions of dollars arrived in Iran through the sale of oil. The Iranians did not benefit, everything was used in the armament. Iran is aggressive.
5029 2018-12-30 20:52:46 Just about every team in the MW plays non-DI games. UNM did this in Hobbs for of the hundreds of millions of dollars in oil money that is here in Hobbs (and the boosters who that money belongs to), and in the gym of the state's most historic high school gym (17 state titles).
5030 2018-12-30 20:52:44 Oga sir
5031 2018-12-30 20:52:38 Bitch really just rinse the meat off wit just water then put olive oil over it, thyme, sea salt and basil talking bout its gunna taste amazing
5032 2018-12-30 20:52:29 Oga sir 
5033 2018-12-30 20:52:10 i'd say rub tea tree oil on ya head..but it sounds like its stress. Drink water and try to relax today
5034 2018-12-30 20:51:53 Olive oil cream cheese is a thing; it really just feels like eating a greasy slice of pizza between a bagel.

Gucci- Guilty Eau Pour Homme (same )
I also make my own essential oil blends. Cherry Blossom oil or a mixture of cedar & eucalyptus  preferably.
5036 2018-12-30 20:51:31 Yeah, the oil companies could drill on it!
5037 2018-12-30 20:51:30 Hala. Sana oil 
5038 2018-12-30 20:51:19 Sadly not a single elected official will enact legislation to remove CU. It will be up to the voters to demand it and will need to start at the local levels. Also banks, oil companies, etc should not be writing the bills they vote on.
5039 2018-12-30 20:51:17 Like oil massage .......
5040 2018-12-30 20:51:05 Wash it down with palm oil
5041 2018-12-30 20:51:00 My hair feels crap, need to get back on the @UdosChoiceUK Oil
5042 2018-12-30 20:50:55 We have great resources ( oil ) all over the region and we are between europe and east Asia ( trade ) its dangerous for other countries if we can utilize our resources and control trade
5043 2018-12-30 20:50:49 Never got my hot oil massage
5044 2018-12-30 20:50:43 Failing getting an offtake agreement with Bayer, our plan would be to weaponize the CBD oil and sell it through our network of Russian Arms dealers. While medical CBD is selling for $3/g wholesale, we see the market for weaponized oil in the $65-$90/g range, in the mid term.
5045 2018-12-30 20:50:37 Yes oo, even here in Lagos , they've broken the drules, no one is obeying Ambode 
5046 2018-12-30 20:50:23 Spent 100 plus CBD oil.
5047 2018-12-30 20:50:17 Let’s stop making cars & kill off the hydro & lumber too then. Those who oppose oil are without a doubt living in a dream state. We NEED oil. Always have & always will. Just remember who butters your bread Nora virus.
5048 2018-12-30 20:49:52 No your Excellency

   You remember that widow and prophet Elisha yeah? The one with little oil and crumps that was asked to pour into gallons yeah?... Same here using this as a point of contact of faith for your 2019 to be money filled
5049 2018-12-30 20:49:46 It’s Fear mongering!  He tearing our country down by not caring about air, water or improving solar energy!  He only listens to big oil industries as they give him money.  He is weakening America for his money donator Putin!  Putin wants our Democracy ruined!
Putin gives orders!
5050 2018-12-30 20:49:46 Mi, a name I call myself
5051 2018-12-30 20:49:37 "Fuck, that's a hover tanker of honey oil boys"
5052 2018-12-30 20:49:37 sad that this happened all across this country....and is still happening...suburbanization and creation of the highways/freeways fueled, literally, by the auto and oil industries.   #springersarepeople
5053 2018-12-30 20:49:36 Niggas think they slick but I'm baby oil bitchhh
5054 2018-12-30 20:49:24 Hey Brittany, they might be 80k trucks but they are not free !

5057 2018-12-30 20:49:10 Derogatory remarks r not helpful 2 communication. Deficit is 1 issue among many/yes it needs attention. Western oil development is an issue but the West, like all of us, need 2 change direction 2 take better care of the earth.Courts,not Trudeau,&4 good reason, challenged pipeline
5058 2018-12-30 20:49:08 Happy new year everyone. New year Wishlist? Brexit with no deal.Just watch EU crumble.Laws allowing anyone to blaspheme any religion without fear of recrimination.The crash of Oil weakening Saudis and Emirates financially and removing their influence over geopolitics. End of UN.
5059 2018-12-30 20:49:05 This information includes the production process of meat, including the current state of livestock, the use of genetically engineered crops and pesticides, and the damage to wild animals and deforestation caused by the production of palm oil. I can't write all the topics here.
5060 2018-12-30 20:49:03 君を揚げたいな…君を炒めたいな…君に僕を絡めたいな…僕は君のそんな存在になりたい。いや、既になってるだろう?
5061 2018-12-30 20:48:37 And we fight wars over oil.  Go figure.
5062 2018-12-30 20:48:35 Tea tree oil is where it's at.
5063 2018-12-30 20:48:34 Red oil abi.
5064 2018-12-30 20:48:30 .@USChamber  And they all saw billions in losses from climate-change related disasters caused by burning oil and gas. So, that would be a very negative ROI.
5065 2018-12-30 20:48:29 You found oil of etherealness. #DnD #ADnD
5066 2018-12-30 20:48:28 You can do it on the grill, but it'll come out great. You can even grill vegetables in some tinfoil, red pepper flakes, Olive oil, and garlic for a great easy side
5067 2018-12-30 20:48:13 To be clear: 1- I am pro EVs that are market supported 2- I am NOT skeptical of EVs, I am skeptical of the impact analysis by various analysts & consulting houses. 
For example, when a major consulting house talks about the impact of E-Busses and say they replace this much oil
5068 2018-12-30 20:48:12 Consumers turn into prosumers by producing data is the “new oil”.

Access to (real time) data on consumption, generation and storage, functioning devices or on behavioral patterns (big data) becomes a crucial competitive advantage.
5069 2018-12-30 20:48:12 Add some eucalyptus essential oil drops to your steam - game changer! 
5070 2018-12-30 20:48:02 I'm just against @BetoORourke cuz he liked about taking money from gas and oil companies.
5071 2018-12-30 20:48:02 sure sure, yet they're in on a 1.3 TRILLION investment portfolio thanks to canny choice with their oil revenue, so [spreads hands]
5072 2018-12-30 20:48:00 Point noter!!!. They will bleach you with hot oil no worry
5073 2018-12-30 20:47:56 The difference here is that the people that have been saying it for decades are funding by the big oil and gas companies hiding it from us. #ExxonKnew
5074 2018-12-30 20:47:43 And yet, my governemt actively speaks for me giving out billions in oil subsidies each year, as well as car and agricultural subsidies. How can it be fair for the population to shoulder the responsibility of fighting the damage already done, and fighting the damage coming?
5075 2018-12-30 20:47:42 Overpaid is overpaid! Manufacturing and the oil industry! Look it up!
5076 2018-12-30 20:47:40 "We Will Rock You" is about the seventies oil price shock
5077 2018-12-30 20:47:23 Audi offers only cheated oil burning  cars at the moment. 

Everything else what they offers are lies like their emission numbers ;)
5078 2018-12-30 20:47:18 You’re no oil painting yourself.
5079 2018-12-30 20:47:17 Build the damn pipeline(s). A majority of this country supports it, and if we don’t, Alberta will punish Canada, perhaps secede. All because the PM is too left-wing and thinks oil is “dirty.”
5080 2018-12-30 20:46:54 Small fried rice you cannot cook..

Something that you will just put rice on the fire  after some minutes..

You will put groundnut oil inside frying pan .. let the oil heat up very well.. then you will be frying the rice small small.. ah! Simple something this one cannot do.
5081 2018-12-30 20:46:50 CDN get the rebate?  Oh man, try telling that to BC consumers who pay the highest prices in North America for gas, nat gas and EVERYthing, in PART from the CO2 tax.  You're right thought, tariffs on imported oil would be sensible
5082 2018-12-30 20:46:49 Simple. Toss in sesame seed, some olive oil, seasoning and bake at 180 for 10ish minutes or until crispy.
5083 2018-12-30 20:46:42 Fry in a bit of sesame oil. Add soy sauce. Nom

5089 2018-12-30 20:46:26 The oil and gas industry is always a competitive one, for major and sub companies, individuals are not left out too. That being said, PB Plus Oil And Gas Training Hub is here to teach you all you need to know about flow station, automation, etc. With live practicals. Just DM us.
5090 2018-12-30 20:46:01 I’d like to know as well because, other than the gas/oil money, I don’t know much about him
5091 2018-12-30 20:46:00 why does my dad add so much oil to soup and why does nobody text me back why am i destined to fail because i was coddled too much as a gifted kid and my brain was never stimulated enough to grow and why am i alone in life :)
5092 2018-12-30 20:45:53 South Philly ... Italian Market ... Olive Oil tasting ... Di Bruno Bros ... Victor’s Cafe 
5093 2018-12-30 20:45:28 For me Iran is setting a new war that will engulf all the middle east. 

Something like Iran, Lebanon, Syria against Isreal, Saudi Arabia and E.A.U.

For the control of the oil reserves.
5094 2018-12-30 20:45:28 If you like a lot of chili oil on your shortcake, join our club!
5095 2018-12-30 20:45:07 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
5096 2018-12-30 20:44:46 I must be on of the few Englishmen who does not normally drink tea, But I will make an exception for Earl Grey which is flavoured with bergamot (orange) oil. It is assumed to be named after 2nd Earl (Charles) Grey, #UK PM in the 1830s. If you haven't tried it, do so.
5097 2018-12-30 20:44:46 Cannabis oil is the dogs bollocks. Obviously not literally. I got some for Pam to use it when she had a wonky knee. Instead of rubbing it in she drank it and knocked herself out. Bonus feature!
5098 2018-12-30 20:44:41 It’s freaking me out how the right and oil are joined at the hip. Can we find the accounting in the Panama papers? What about that one firm from canada that pops up the most.
5099 2018-12-30 20:44:33 / my mom is from martinique and her family moved between there and puerto rico so i guess i just take after the fact that she didn’t burn? but i live in south florida and 10 min from the beach so i’m always tanning and iDK I JUST DONT BURN. i lather on oil and move on
5100 2018-12-30 20:44:29 I just wanted someone to listen to me and to comfort me. I’m not up for judgement nor opinions. 
I know my flaws and stubbornness and I’ve been incapable of changing them. I just need “oil on my wounds” and perhaps a miracle healing.

5101 2018-12-30 20:44:27 I'm not big L at all. It's not for me to decide if a mechanic wants to sell steaks next to motor oil. I can decide to not buy steaks from him. I can't decide if you want to buy steaks from him, nor should anyone else decide what's best for you.
5102 2018-12-30 20:44:21 The bondi sands liquid gold oil 
5103 2018-12-30 20:44:14 There's no one else on the field for Dak to throw too other than @Bease11 , let's not reach for the annointing oil just yet.
5104 2018-12-30 20:44:04 Jeff, drop coins for boys o, now that you have more crude oil on rig to work on
5105 2018-12-30 20:44:00 Lol.  Sheesh lady....lol.

Alberta has emissions so CANADA can prosper.  If the oil was in Quebec then they would have the most emissions wouldn’t they?

Lol.  Enough.  You hurt my brain mush.  Enjoy.
5106 2018-12-30 20:43:52 Hi Amy.
What you need is pure CBD oil to reduce anxiety and promote better rest. If a CBD oil contains melatonin, it's of very poor quality.
P.S.: the wife and I love your show.

5108 2018-12-30 20:43:25 Yet another stupid juvenile comment from JK. So ppl that want to improve the environment can’t fly or drive? That’s why you lose reasonable ppl who want to support oil and gas AND protect the environment. Good thing there r some O&G company’s that r smarter than you are.
5109 2018-12-30 20:43:20 I didn’t even use beard oil pls stop dragging me for no reason 
5110 2018-12-30 20:43:18 US meddling in oil-producing countries is a substantial subsidy to the oil industry. If that money were spent on sustainable energy sources instead, your commute would almost certainly be cheaper than it is
5111 2018-12-30 20:43:13 Kind of interesting how that conversation came up. My great-aunt had an oil well she got monthly payments for. It was still producing the day she died.
5112 2018-12-30 20:43:10 Yep  keep you some peppermint oil too. The menthol is soothing and works fast. Plus it smells good.
5113 2018-12-30 20:43:06 How do you get black oil paint off the white dog’s tail

5117 2018-12-30 20:42:24 The cost of electric vehicles v oil prices will play an important role in the level of demand for electric vehicles. Low oil prices generally boost sales of big engine vehicles specifically SUVs. Low oil prices makes electric cars less compelling for consumers.
5118 2018-12-30 20:42:22 Would you guys be interested in me adding beard oil and skin toners to my product line?
5119 2018-12-30 20:42:19 Will you take my car to get an oil change
5120 2018-12-30 20:42:17 Thursday 27th, the Dow staged a comeback. YES!, As losses are erased - a record gain  (611pts) in one day. Still in correction territory, but what a bounce back! Wishing  the same, for the oil world. What oil pain felt - crude slumping quite threateningly (Thurs). HAPPY NEW YEAR!
5121 2018-12-30 20:41:58 Okay how operational vessels are on patrol as we speak protecting or oil and gas fields in the North Sea and Shetland Basin, and the least said about the RAF and MPA's the better, eh!
5122 2018-12-30 20:41:54 Aided by corrupt Politicians, Bankers and an Oil Guru the hijackers finally cross the CIA who use Parky and his team of killers and torturers to put together 'dead men walking'
5123 2018-12-30 20:41:50 War is only an exception when absolutely the last result.  Pearl Harbor being that of an exception. It's not like he was taking out regimes n order 2 profit from oil.  I despise war, but, I do like his Social and Economic views. War for profit is something  neoliberals r fond of.

5125 2018-12-30 20:41:49 An example, just to know how bullshit is human rights orgs and icc, when it comes to oil ethics can be a deal...
5126 2018-12-30 20:41:49 This was such a great set, and its not because i love oil. Your shape is aesthetic and perfect as anatomy practice!
5127 2018-12-30 20:41:40 Have been saying for ages they needed to be tied :)

5129 2018-12-30 20:41:21 They ignored the government's recommendations to clear the dead trees and underbrush that accumulated from drought. Idiots didn't bother. I suppose when going without Starbucks is considered "roughing it" they wouldn't have a clue what "kindling" is.
5130 2018-12-30 20:41:17 I mean you can put castor oil in your hair at night it helps it grow but you have to wash your hair in the morning
5131 2018-12-30 20:41:15 The 'carb flu' might just be needing magnesium/potassium/sodium.. when you lower carbs you excrete more electrolytes. You could also try MCT oil and/or exogenous ketones to help transition if it's more of a brain fog from having low glucose but not adapted to making ketones.

5134 2018-12-30 20:40:57 Western nations always take gas, oil and resources and leave a profit margin miles high for the military industrial complex. 
But “why don’t gulf nations take refugees?” 
Smh.
5135 2018-12-30 20:40:55 Norway didn’t use its oil $ for tax cuts either. Saved it all and restricts itself to a certain % of the fund’s annual return for its budget.
5136 2018-12-30 20:40:54 Jones has played very well considering the mess we are in deserved all the ice he has earned. I hope he doesn’t get bumped. Gravel was solid when he was playing the right minutes.
5137 2018-12-30 20:40:51 I bet the oil companies aren't happy about this!
5138 2018-12-30 20:40:38 thinking about doing a mineral oil build...wondering if it'd be worth the time....and maintenance.
5139 2018-12-30 20:40:36 I’ve tried hemp oil tablets. They help to an extent. Just can’t afford CBD oil to smoke etc. A lot of Gp’s aren’t very keen prescribing it.
5140 2018-12-30 20:40:33 It’s lots of farming going on here in the Delta but it’s mostly for oil and manufacturing, not consumption. Lots of talk about urban farming but know we’re pushing this in rural areas too.  can’t wait for spring 
5141 2018-12-30 20:40:32 Me: I'm going to oven toast slices of a baguette. When it comes out, I'll rub fresh garlic on it for that extra hint of flavor & top with good olive oil & goat cheese.

Hubby: You need to stop watching @FoodNetwork. Is that a @TheTedAllen  recipe? Can't you eat normal snacks?

5145 2018-12-30 20:40:13 It's called "science". And you don't think snake oil like detox formulae aren't a billion dollar business?
5146 2018-12-30 20:40:13 Oil dey your head ola
5147 2018-12-30 20:40:12 Fall of the Roman Empire? Elites refused to be taxed, grow profitable olive oil and wine for export instead of staple grains, Empire forced to conquer and pillage to sustain economy for plebs, collapses when the empire exhausted all pillaging options & could no longer pay troops.
5148 2018-12-30 20:40:06 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？

5151 2018-12-30 20:39:48 Frogs that, instead of making sounds, will give people free oil changes if you leave your car parked outside.
5152 2018-12-30 20:39:41 Well done! It took me a long time to kick my own nail biting, but I'm still trying to get around biting the skin around them. Argan oil really helped bc it made my nails stronger, healed the skin and also tasted naaasty lmao
5153 2018-12-30 20:39:35 I wonder if your views would change if you weren't funded by big oil companies.
5154 2018-12-30 20:39:26 Do I like art? 

Yes. I do love the 18th episode of the 2nd season of Shadowhunters entitled “Awake, Arise, or Be Forever Fallen” that aired during the Spring of the 17th year of the new Millennium with direction by Amanda M. Row and screenplay by Jamie Gorenberg. Oil on Canvas.

5156 2018-12-30 20:39:15 You want Pete making that deal?
5157 2018-12-30 20:39:04 Peter Hitchens. @ClarkeMicah Russia consumes 3,300 barrels of oil a day. Texas and California combined, consume 1,600 barrels a day. Stands to reason that Russia's economy is bigger than the nonsense Pentagon propaganda says it is.
5158 2018-12-30 20:38:30 Thank you o jare. Some people call malt drinkers the diesel drinkers meanwhile people outchea busy soaking oil filled sponges
5159 2018-12-30 20:38:29 With Russell coming back Wideman was the guy coming out. In all honesty, not sure I view Petrovic as much of an upgrade over Benning, Jones or Gravel. He certainly adds depth but parting with a 3rd rounder to further pad the bottom pairing seems perplexing.
5160 2018-12-30 20:38:22 Brussels sprouts...rasanya pait2 gimana gitu...seringnya sih aku panggang di oven atau sauté pake olive oil.
5161 2018-12-30 20:38:19 So @walt2thumbsup really ain’t gone change my oil??? Ok, bet!
5162 2018-12-30 20:38:16 Life with teenage boys.
I'm getting ready to cut wood. Every stihl wrench is missing. Bar oil- missing. 1gallon gas can for mix gas- missing. Store bought mix gas- missing. Of course it's Sunday and everything is closed. Ask boys if they've seen the stuff- I don't know dad.
5163 2018-12-30 20:38:13 make fun of me if you MUST but I genuinely recommend CBD oil for people with anxiety. I have mint tea infused with it that I got almost two weeks ago
5164 2018-12-30 20:38:12 Sell the team! Sell the team! Sell the team!
5165 2018-12-30 20:38:05 Super stoked to see @WHLGiants play the Oil Kings on New Year's Day but I can't for the life of me find my Giants gear... I need to be -that- guy help a fan stuck in Edmonton out G-Men!

The issue is that we can’t get Alberta oil to foreign markets & the US is screwing us on price. 10 yrs & they didn’t get it done, & Harper is from Calgary ffs!

5174 2018-12-30 20:37:27 King Jaja of Opobo (1821–1891) founded Opobo city (now in Nigeria) in 1867 and shipped palm oil to Britain independently.
5175 2018-12-30 20:37:27 Just make sure that it has it's oil changed & slowly begin replacing parts. I was lucky Suzuki made a vehicle that was a well built machine. Parts didn't start to need replacing until the 20th year. It was bought out of necessity-mtn roads & I never had a car payment.

5178 2018-12-30 20:37:06 Peppermint is a temporary deterrent. Essential oil in a water bottle and spray around openings. Rodents (even squirrels) do not like the smell. I had a mouse once and didn't know where it was. Started spraying and it immediately showed itself to run for the opening.

5185 2018-12-30 20:36:36 Hmm her body just says “caress me and rub that ass with coconut oil” or I'm just hearing wrong
5186 2018-12-30 20:36:33 Lots of unpredictable individual and communal choices will be made in the next year to influence oil price... but just for fun... One year from today....56% Chance of $63/bbl, 33% chance of $43/bbl, and 15% chance of $56/bbl on Dec 30 2018.
5187 2018-12-30 20:36:31 i got my bf those oil blotters for your face and every time he does one he sends it to me 
5188 2018-12-30 20:36:10 A little mayo or olive oil would also be nice, also. And maybe some mozzarella to make a Caprese sandwich.
5189 2018-12-30 20:36:09 Nice! I’m not a huge fan of ylang ylang, but I’ve only blended it with bergamot.. maybe I should try something more Earthy instead. 
But yes, Shea butter and coconut oil is a must for my entire body!!

5192 2018-12-30 20:36:02 No. 
Trump did not "create" this thinking.
Trump is a snake oil salesman.
He can 'read' & manipulate a crowd.  
He has taken advantage of the legitimate concerns as well as the hateful racism embedded in Am society, to divide, & wind up frightened & selfish people into a frenzy.
5193 2018-12-30 20:35:57 My mom had severe back-pains some while ago aur mein unki qamar par olive oil se roz raat ko massage karti thi. It’s the best! Best natural remedy hai for any sort of muscle aches
5194 2018-12-30 20:35:55 << nightly moisturizer, prevents razor burn, soothes cuts and bruises

rose oil - promotes a calm mood , fights harmful organisms, alleviates wrinkles

5195 2018-12-30 20:35:52 was about 12. Wanted fried rice so I literally put groundnut oil on fire and poured raw rice to fry
5196 2018-12-30 20:35:39 Yeah. I’m sure Russia, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, US are shutting down their oil industry as well. There’s hardly any use for it anymore right?............well except for about 80% of products we use everyday of course.
5197 2018-12-30 20:35:21 my work coming out w a new cannabis seed oil concentrate this month and I've already tried it and it made my face feel so tingly and happi hehe I'm excited for da release
5198 2018-12-30 20:35:16 Once it grows up and they start milking it they won't need oil anymore.
5199 2018-12-30 20:35:05 I'm not sure if baby oil is vegan :/
5200 2018-12-30 20:34:57 She should have no trouble working for an oil company, cigarette company, or one of several foreign governments who need a spokesperson not afraid to lie bluntly to your face.
5201 2018-12-30 20:34:51 I don’t believe you understand what oil brings to your table, I don’t believe you understand how diligent pipeline companies are in the remediation process, i don’t believe you get it at all.
5202 2018-12-30 20:34:44 Reminds me of the multi peak “peak oil theory”
5203 2018-12-30 20:34:39 Thank you  I use the oil for my scars topically!!!
5204 2018-12-30 20:34:34 Have you signed on to the New Green Deal? Have you renounced corporate funding? Oil & Gas funding? Are you co-sponsoring Medicare for All ?

5207 2018-12-30 20:34:04 too many gaps to be oil
5208 2018-12-30 20:33:58 I can’t believe neutrals and rivals don’t want us to win the league and would prefer city win it. 
Why would you want the team ran by a country on oil money to win? Just don’t get it. PSG and City are ruining the game.
5209 2018-12-30 20:33:51 
5210 2018-12-30 20:33:43 Man fucc that state it can drink oil for all I care

5212 2018-12-30 20:33:29 4/ In many cases they’re just arguing that government subsidies currently going to oil companies should be redirected to the development of alternative energy sources.
5213 2018-12-30 20:33:18 It’s not about some “selfish preference”. We deserve Bernie. We need Bernie. If we get another neolib nothing will change. They are bought by big oil, the MIC, big pharma, Israel, Wall Street, etc. As far as I can tell, Bernie is still the most popular politician as well.
5214 2018-12-30 20:33:02 90% of renewables subject to turmoil? What? How does an existing piece of fixed capital just evaporate and stop working if Saudi Arabia gets mad at us or a Russian war breaks out, etc?

Why use our fossil fuels at home when we can export them to weaken the oil states?
5215 2018-12-30 20:32:47 I think most people in the United States that are jailed should not be in prison especially drug users, the only people I think need prison time are murderers, drug dealers, pedophiles, and some Wall Street and Oil executives lol. But you don't think any prison can be humane?
5216 2018-12-30 20:32:44 My mom's gonna get me some CBD oil and gummies so I can try to get off taking Ambien and Xanax  hopefully I can eventually get off my antidepressants/stabilizers too.
5217 2018-12-30 20:32:37 My educational background is in chemical engineering and in chemistry. I can break down exactly how the oil industry contributes big time to climate change if you like. That being said, I’m sure you would find a way to dismiss science.

5220 2018-12-30 20:32:10 Home delivery for @Safeway not that impressive.  Items arbitrarily substituted, telephone support tried to convince me that tuna in oil substitute for tuna in water is a change in size. Then hung up on me when I requested to speak to supervisor.
5221 2018-12-30 20:31:56 Which IU of vitamin E oil do you use??
5222 2018-12-30 20:31:49 Palmyra & Deir Ezzor, while the international coalition was busy taking oil fields in the middle of nowhere.
5223 2018-12-30 20:31:28 My sister @19Warrior85 taught me the cup trick.....Mug, cling-film over the top, oil the inside slightly, crack egg in, tie top of cling film and the drop into boiling water.
5224 2018-12-30 20:31:27 2/ But if your argument rests on a non-sequitur, then don’t be surprised when the rest of us point and laugh when you trot it out.

The central fallacy is this: one doesn’t need to abstain from using the oil that powers society today in order to argue for change tomorrow
5225 2018-12-30 20:31:21 Not oil 
5226 2018-12-30 20:31:12 My general go to now is blockade. Otex then depending on the job aqua hemli or if required pretty much any oil base. Would love to here your thoughts on blockade
5227 2018-12-30 20:31:06 Hollywood beauty tea tree oil isnt real tea tree oil 
5228 2018-12-30 20:30:56 Oil tanking due to the high prices in yr, world can't afford these prices.  High debt in world economy makes problem worse.  Great for EV's to roll out faster. If we can cut bus fleet over to electric,  got to be a good thing for our economy. Oil has killed economy in past.
5229 2018-12-30 20:30:44 Literally just any decent fried rice recipe, replace the oil with duck fat.
5230 2018-12-30 20:30:42 She created San Francisco’s first Environmental Justice Unit and went after cases involving illegal dumping and air pollution. As AG, she went after big oil and obtained the largest settlement of its kind for the 2007 spill in the SF Bay.
5231 2018-12-30 20:30:41 Its all lies lies by capitalist Colombia with money and backing from the US UK to bring down socialist Venezuela by spreading lies the US UK wants Venezuela's oil gold and gas and the west is trying to bring the elected venezuelan government by lies

5235 2018-12-30 20:30:17 This past week I timed how long it took me to get ready for bed (wash face, put beard oil and brush, brush teeth, floss, and it was 7 mins. 2x day that’s 15 mins.

5246 2018-12-30 20:29:19 Let's be honest...the majority of the government is funded through September 2019. The #TrumpShutdown is a political stunt (my guess) most likely designed by Steven Miller because Trump isn't that smart. The snake oil salesman LIES are past annoying.

5249 2018-12-30 20:28:53 On 15k litres 50-80 litres evaporate, again depending on the temperature. Oil companies don’t compensate the pump owners for the shortage. If shortage is 2/3 of a bar, pump owner can be considered as honest, above is dishonesty.

5252 2018-12-30 20:28:32 But Alberta did little with their oil revenue besides squander it. Invest for a rainy day getting it's money to make money, aka Norway? Nope.

5258 2018-12-30 20:27:07 Beto is not in the pocket of big oil. The contributions attributed to oil companies came from employees of oil companies. Rank and file employees, because contributors have to list their employer.
5259 2018-12-30 20:27:05 the terrorists would be the misunderstood good guys. It wouldn't be Nakatomi it would be some oil company polluting the environment. At the end, McClane would turn his tazer on the CEO and say the "terrorists" were right.

5269 2018-12-30 20:25:00 I've been through it. I only went through it because I didn't know the answer. 
You need to drink one to two ounces of olive oil every day. You can mix it with anything. Olive oil breaks down the stones which are made by the liver. They get trapped in the gall bladder...
5270 2018-12-30 20:24:50 According to oil fans they got a real tough guy, solid defender who makes a great first pass...

I think they think they traded for Pietrangelo.
5271 2018-12-30 20:24:44 I got blocked when I mentioned my vegan physician. Phil whined and whined about the abuse he said I was inflicting on him by calling him a snake oil salesman, yet I channel an actually expert and poof, bye bye Phil. 
5272 2018-12-30 20:24:32 How about electing Condaleeza Rice? Not only would she appeal to suburban Republicans, she’s got an oil tanker named after her! How cool is that?!
5273 2018-12-30 20:24:30 I’m disappointed in you @SylviaJonesMPP.  You were a @GreenPACdotca candidate and can’t possibly believe the tweets you are sending out.  The lower gas prices are almost exclusively caused by lower oil prices and a price on carbon is the best solution to fight #climatechange.

5278 2018-12-30 20:23:55 You know a good start to reducing our carbon footprint would be to require all trains to run on biofuel and big trucks after all the diesel engine was created to run on peanut oil not dirty fuel
5279 2018-12-30 20:23:53 What if we taxed OPEC countries the gas tax/tariffs so they would be influenced to export less petroleum and oil and average people wouldn’t be as directly influenced from tax #gastax
5280 2018-12-30 20:23:23 If you work for the oil and gas industry are you going to donate to a guy who is for a green new deal? Essentially putting you out of a job? If you work for the pharmaceutical industry are you going to donate to a guy who will cut drug prices? Sorry your argument doesn't work.
5281 2018-12-30 20:23:23 Don’t you hate when the oil change place offers you 637383836 things to fix on your car and it’s like hello, my synthetic oil is expensive enough... but I guess I will get all my filters changed 
5282 2018-12-30 20:23:19 That's exactly what happened when I was trying to make soup at my mom's house. I kept reading you're supposed to heat the pan and then put in the oil. The second the oil hit the pan

5287 2018-12-30 20:23:05 This is absolute hogwash. There r 5 gazillion problems in a country of 220 million. But it's a list and one has to be on top.
5288 2018-12-30 20:23:01 with all due respect first fire your president then fix your healthcare then fix your banking and then fix your oil problems damn your country is dying of bad decisions and poor management...

5290 2018-12-30 20:22:45 Indeed. That act of pure evil, which killed Iran's attempt at democracy and has led to the messy situation today, was about keeping western control of Iran's oil. 

These wars are *always* about money and to a lesser extent, control.

4. Divide mixture amongst muffin tins and freezer for 10 minutes to firm up.

5302 2018-12-30 20:21:26 Don’t tell me what I’ve done.  It might have something to do with the fact that we have no trading partners to sell oil to because Trump blew up every deal we were in.Europe would love to get oil at a price cheaper than they get now and it would still be a huge profit to the US.
5303 2018-12-30 20:21:13 Kimchi is delicious

Try this marinade 
Kikkoman soy sauce- base
Sesame oil  just a few drops
Roasted sesame seeds
Finely chopped green onion
1-2 garlic cloves minced
Dark brown sugar- offsets saltiness and for caramelized outside
Ginger just a bit

Red meat, chicken & fish

5323 2018-12-30 20:19:45 I oiled a pan one time with WAY too much olive oil, allowed it to get hot, and then dropped a frozen turkey burger onto the pan. It was like the Hindenburg. Terrifying

5346 2018-12-30 20:17:08 My a - - - re taking control of oil and going independent as it won’t happen after mess the IstMin.& SNPgov. have made of Scotland all these in power.
5347 2018-12-30 20:16:49 The point is this. Let’s not shut ourselves out of international trade in oil and gas while we patiently wait for renewables to become an economically viable alternative
5348 2018-12-30 20:16:31 40% of Norway's economy is dependent on oil revenues. An independent Scotland's would be 10% reliant on oil.
5349 2018-12-30 20:16:22 Resources R less important than culture, values & economic system.  Venezuela w/ most convential oil is in poverty.  Russia wealthy in natural resources but is a 3rd world country w/ large military.  Israel, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan are wealthy by have little natural resources.
5350 2018-12-30 20:16:16 I get it, you’re a big ‘L’ and I’m just a little ‘l’. In your world, a mechanic should sell steaks next to the motor oil. 

What my issue with change is that you have small businesses that invested money into their future based on a known set of facts and the market had balance.
5351 2018-12-30 20:16:11 Yes! The 10:1 and 5:5 oil is fully decarbed! 
5352 2018-12-30 20:16:06 Oil, just tastes like I’ve emptied tobacco in to my mouth. 
5353 2018-12-30 20:15:56 Do they have oil heat?
If so they are absolutely correct
5354 2018-12-30 20:15:53 As long as we are on this Earth Satan will attack us and make us feel like Jesus is not around. Start praying , read psalm 23 every morning & annoit yourself w/oil . Any oil
5355 2018-12-30 20:15:51 I’d be perfectly happy if people would just stop wearing patchouli oil as a cologne/perfume!

How's that Big Defense MIC endorsement comin along @BetoORourke ?
5365 2018-12-30 20:15:04 And you're ugly. So now can we talk about some real issues that matter?  Like Benghazi gun running, and Obamas 10 day advance warning? or murder of Ghadafi for gold and oil and intentional destabilization of the middle east. Or maybe Sex trafficking by elite senators, and actors.
5366 2018-12-30 20:15:00 Learning you can get an oil change in ~10 minutes while you sit in your car has changed my life. And I get a water? Bitch what???
5367 2018-12-30 20:14:58 This oil n my cup can go tune up a motor..... Zay$
5368 2018-12-30 20:14:42 saved oil workers, military personnel, schoolbus full of kids, Lois, people from floods, people from fire, and humanity 3x, but its not enough.

5372 2018-12-30 20:14:07 Who are the people of whom you speak? I sure don't want a wall.  Had I  lived in 1319, maybe I would have a different view.  But even then they could only prevent wall breeches by having vats of boiling oil at the top. Oil is too expensive now
5373 2018-12-30 20:14:05 Dam I thought she was off all social media since dat oil field mane left her
5374 2018-12-30 20:14:04 I know curly hair and straight hair require different things but I read that our scalp only produces the oil it thinks we need. Maybe it’s being over washed, so it’s producing even more oil than necessary?
5375 2018-12-30 20:14:04 i’m gonna do a hot oil treatment in my hair today + a scalp massage  
5376 2018-12-30 20:14:00 So why did Trump sell for 15% of the reserves when oil prices were at their lowest price in awhile?
5377 2018-12-30 20:13:56 Popeye resigned - trouble with Olive Oil. Too foreign. @peoplesvote_uk
5378 2018-12-30 20:13:55 Not sure where you have been the last 3 years other than your head in the sand. Your ok with billions of a deficit and rising, the economic breakdown of western oil development of a pipeline to tide water or perhaps spending 4.5 bill on a pipeline he won’t allow to be built?

5381 2018-12-30 20:13:28 The strange infiltration of the tech industry - along with media, entertainment and failing domains like gas, oil and coal - and the relentless theft of intellectual property by foreign intelligence are why key innovations never saw the light of day.

5383 2018-12-30 20:13:14 Hi Joel - wow, it looks like you've captured an oil painting from the outer decks! Feel free to give the ocean a 'wave' back during your sailing. :) Thanks for sharing.^rz

5385 2018-12-30 20:13:08 Why is it called losing and not just spending?
Car analogy again, but when I buy a car for 20,000 fill it with 5000 in fuel annually, tires, oil, etc. I don't expect the cost of the upkeep to be paid back to me by the person I sell it to.
5386 2018-12-30 20:13:06 Smh I need 2 get this oil
5387 2018-12-30 20:13:00 Me: could you bring down your laundry?

5389 2018-12-30 20:12:56 tryna melt the coconut oil tub with my thighs 
5390 2018-12-30 20:12:56 Exactly what I did. I really try and avoid palm oil. Looks good app 
5391 2018-12-30 20:12:55 Got out the rig in a parking lot and slipped and fell straight on my ass cuz the ground was covered in oil.
5392 2018-12-30 20:12:48 Sunflower oil tasted the least fucked up
5393 2018-12-30 20:12:40 Finite is finite, how is it finite only technically?? Just because we are extracting more oil now than before doesn't mean there's suddenly more oil in the earth's crust.. again, why do we wanna stick to polluting oil when there are other sustainable options available??
5394 2018-12-30 20:12:36 Warm rag or add some oil so they’ll start to slip a lil
5395 2018-12-30 20:12:35 Aint many know how to do it even with them knowing....but lawd if he knows(the ass becomes a well oil machine) watch out
5396 2018-12-30 20:12:13 Thats not true, however they would not have a veto and oil and fish would have to be owned by the French. But all for the Unicorn vanity project that is the EU right!?
5397 2018-12-30 20:12:12 Bro that’s all Ghanaians give as Christmas gifts. The number of hampers we got with rice oil and sardine hm
5398 2018-12-30 20:12:06 Guess where the 93,000,000:00 naira came from?

Crude Oil.

Same states will use there Islamic Police to destroy millions of crates of beer, while they will use the VAT paid by the Breweries to marry off orphans.

5403 2018-12-30 20:11:43 Sorry @VictorFedeli but the low gas prices we’re seeing are due to the price of a barrel of oil not anything your government did. But keep on telling your base what they want to hear. No fear they’ll actually do their own thinking on this. #fakenews

5406 2018-12-30 20:11:16 Gold and other solid minerals in the northern part of Nigeria are scooped by their people without harrassment or molestation by the government, while oil bunckerers in the Niger-Delta are tag criminals and visited with lethal force. What a country!
5407 2018-12-30 20:11:12 i got oil paints for christmas and AHH honestly i cant wait to go to a workshop and try them out :((
5408 2018-12-30 20:11:07 Hey, I am all for moving away from fossil fuels, but you’re not comparing fossil fuels to nothing and if you’re honest and you look into it you’ll discover that right now oil in cars still has the least environmental impact. Educate yourself, don’t be blinded by the hype.
5409 2018-12-30 20:11:02 Are what new? Essential oil scents?
5410 2018-12-30 20:10:48 Did you get oil or capsules?
5411 2018-12-30 20:10:45 Plunging global oil prices are responsible for lower gas prices....all across the country. Eliminating cap and trade contributed to our credit downgrade, though. Sad that you willfully lie to Ontarians. What are you going to say when prices go back up, as they are expected to do?
5412 2018-12-30 20:10:41 Sorry @celliottability but the low gas prices we’re seeing are due to the price of a barrel of oil not anything your government did. But keep on telling your base what they want to hear. No fear they’ll actually do their own thinking on this. #fakenews
5413 2018-12-30 20:10:36 Oil guys are scared out of their minds over the thought of these new EVs.
5414 2018-12-30 20:10:30 No it isn’t.  And the rest of the developed world is moving away from oil and gas anyway. You can get VHS tapes pretty cheap these days too.
5415 2018-12-30 20:10:26 Their entire infrastructure (pipelines/roads/rail cars are paid for by the public, not just cleaning up their horrific mess. AB made less in royalties throughout this oil economy than the cost to taxpayers for infrastructure and cleanup.

5421 2018-12-30 20:10:02 “He will love you and bless you and increase your numbers. He will bless the fruit of your womb, the crops of your land—your grain, new wine and olive oil—the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks in the land he swore to your ancestors to give you.” -Deuteronomy 7:13
5422 2018-12-30 20:09:50 Wars in the Middle East are mostly wars over who gets to profit from oil fields. Saudi terrorist Madrasa schools are funded by oil money. The costs of wars for oil are borne by ordinary middle class people. It’s more than the inevitable switch to solar, wind & hydro power.
5423 2018-12-30 20:09:44 We worked with a team who worked at that Italian village mystery. No cancer. No one in town gets cancer. It’s intriguing. Probably the Omega 3 in their Olive Oil + something else.
5424 2018-12-30 20:09:41 Super interesting, and great thread! 

My personal opinion / hot takes are: 

1. It will depend largely on what areas are hit the hardest, and what caused the crisis. 

Ex. Oil boom / crash, rural housing vs. cities.
5425 2018-12-30 20:09:34 I'm assuming you got the $24 trillion in Cosmic Cash I sent you to pay off the national debt and back the world's economies by the clear gold made of plastic from black gold (oil) mentioned in Revelation 21:18, 21. I can send you another $5 billion for the wall. @michaeljesusar1

5429 2018-12-30 20:09:23 If I were to recommend just ONE essential oil to anyone I would recommend Melrose. It’s literally the best oil ever. I put a drop on my toothpaste every morning and night to kill all the bacteria in my mouth. It’s AMAZING!!!
5430 2018-12-30 20:09:21 Sorry @SkellyHamilton but the low gas prices we’re seeing are due to the price of a barrel of oil not anything your government did. But keep on telling your base what they want to hear. No fear they’ll actually do their own thinking on this. #fakenews
5431 2018-12-30 20:09:12 Aw, muffin. Oil is the only thing that fuels our economy? Consider me educated then. Please tell me where I once said I don’t use oil or am against it. I’ll wait. I’m against assholes who think they’re entitled to things because they say so, NOW!
5432 2018-12-30 20:09:09 "Fire can't melt steel!", "Bush made it happen on purpose so he could steal the oil in Iraq!", "Chickens coming home to roost!".  Stuff like that gets mindlessly recited back at you.
5433 2018-12-30 20:09:02 im soo mystified...corn oil comes from corn, vegetable oil from vegetables, baby oil.........? �N
5434 2018-12-30 20:08:49 Yes all palm oil! 
5435 2018-12-30 20:08:49 Rice, sardine and oil?
5436 2018-12-30 20:08:32  ......can you also make a list of the false claims aka #HopeandChange and redistribution of wealth jive of #Obama who became a #Multimillionaire selling the snake oil and destroying businesses he did not create?
5437 2018-12-30 20:08:28 Did I say we need to completely cease oil production? Did anyone? It's about meeting reduction targets. AB is going in the opposite direction, and the majority of what it produces is exported and not needed or used by Canadians.
5438 2018-12-30 20:08:24 Do you guys have a lie meter at something? Because I think you’re reaching your limit. Oil prices are NOT set by the Ontario government #ONpoli #canpoli
5439 2018-12-30 20:08:24 I’m so proud of myself for getting out of bed to get this oil change
5440 2018-12-30 20:08:22 (2) I too was discriminated against at a @Hilton. Was at the Hilton Fashion District in NYC on 03Dec18. I immediately fell as I walked in to check in. No mat or caution sign at entrance. Showed staff. Floor was  soaked w/ water & very slippery like baby oil. #Hilton #DoubleTree

5446 2018-12-30 20:07:45 I'm not usually in support of violent direct action, but if we have access to giant wolves I think we should use them to ride down anyone who owns stock in an oil company.

Big owners first, to allow time for market adjustment.

To giant eco-justice wolves.
5447 2018-12-30 20:07:42 Technically it’s finite (possibly), but not really. There’s more oil reserves available now than there was a few years ago and there will be more available in 10 years than now. From what we can see now, there’s enough for the next 100+ years. Doesn’t seem that finite... hmm? 
5448 2018-12-30 20:07:42 Ah, time for the snake oil sales people to prey on people.
5449 2018-12-30 20:07:41 Can’t wait to run my man a shower, pour oil on the floor, then beat him w/ a belt 
5450 2018-12-30 20:07:36 sana oil
5451 2018-12-30 20:07:34 Oil is the basis of civilizations with a middle class. The globalists attempts to destroy the oil industry via the UN pulls the western world in the direction you describe.
5452 2018-12-30 20:07:33 When you are in fear of your life it's often difficult to arrange the correct paperwork. If we stopped interfering in resource-rich countries to access their oil and gas this problem wouldn't exist.

The flowers look tasty, just about ready to spark one up.. I'll let you know bro.. xo
5454 2018-12-30 20:07:15 I always prefer to buy coopoliva olive oil. It's great in quality and taste
5455 2018-12-30 20:07:09 When my grandfather was in school he was taught we would run out of oil in 20 years. When my father was in school he was taught we would run out of oil in 20 years. And when I was in school in the sixties we were taught we would run out of oil in 20 years.
5456 2018-12-30 20:07:08 Getting oil changes is too much for me
5457 2018-12-30 20:07:03 God curses the ground in Genesis 3 necessitating Adam's labor. He also creates patriarchy as part of Eve's curse. Don't know how else to read it. I feel bad for sincere believers like you who will constantly be in the shadow of snake oil salesman #capitalism #flipthetables
5458 2018-12-30 20:07:02 Found the same on @southayrshire beach a couple of years back, used oil likely from a fishing boat. At that time of year we had many duckling Eider about and just think what would happen if kids got hold of it and poured it out. I removed it.
5459 2018-12-30 20:07:01 Because the tax makes using dirty fuels more­ expensive, it encourages utilities, businesses & individuals to reduce consumption &increase energy efficiency. Carbon tax also makes alternative energy more cost-competitive with cheaper, polluting fuels like coal, natural gas & oil.

5461 2018-12-30 20:06:38 I keep tryna get to 20 minutes but I’ve only made it to 11 lol. Helps if you put peppermint oil in it it doesn’t taste as weird
5462 2018-12-30 20:06:37 nope. oil change then go home
5463 2018-12-30 20:06:23 i got this new sleeping oil and that shit works because i slept until 1:13 this afternoon
5464 2018-12-30 20:06:12 Restaurants with allergen menus are the unsung heroes of the world. 

If you don't have an allergen menu, at least tell me what kind of oil you use. Come onnn.
5465 2018-12-30 20:06:06 But then again, fair and JBJ is like mixing oil with water so... who knows lol
5466 2018-12-30 20:05:59 No wonder oil is tanking. Once everyone realizes their combustion engine cars will have no resale value there will be a rush to the exits.

5470 2018-12-30 20:05:25 But have you talked to Indonesians (& Malaysians) how they feel about palm oil, and the economic benefits that palm oil brings to both countries?
5471 2018-12-30 20:05:11 Although this line of thinking makes me wonder, is anything truly "stable" in that sense without ECC RAM, which no consumer boards allow?

(And the answer is, yes, because ECC is a lie spread by Big Server RAM to trick us into buying snake oil!!!)
5472 2018-12-30 20:05:07 I should be getting my oil changed today but I woke up at 1:30 so I’ve decided to go shopping instead

5474 2018-12-30 20:04:47 The World is Not Enough is a movie where James Bond is defending an Oil Pipeline
5475 2018-12-30 20:04:44 How about:
- Russia should leave all international organizations except UNSC
- Russia should stop pumping to raise the oil price
- Russia should send troops to Ukraine to protect ethnic Russians and deal with Kiev Nazis

Still disagree with Putin?
5476 2018-12-30 20:04:37 Nigeria is best described as a Theocracy and not a Democracy. When d average Nigerian falls ill, he drinks anointing oil/calls his pastor/Imam for prayers. When he loses his job he goes to church for miracle job prayers. The government has been abandoned to its irresponsibility
5477 2018-12-30 20:04:35 When we get the steel slats for the wall we should oil them. 
5478 2018-12-30 20:04:31 Absolutely. Avoiding palm oil for example.
5479 2018-12-30 20:04:24 Another Fraser Institute study paid for by american oil companies and the Koch brothers. If you prefer corporate healthcare and corporate welfare then the US would surely welcome you. I prefer my tax dollars going to the people and not to prop up big american companies.
5480 2018-12-30 20:04:24 Been there and they sure was happy when everything was government subsidized. All this while bashing the gringo for stilling there oil. Socialism at its best. Don’t feel sorry with self inflicted fatal wounds.
5481 2018-12-30 20:04:16 So it seems your analysis based on WBB was in total contradiction to what Waldergrave and Ashcroft were saying.  Your assertions that somehow the SNP over stated the Oil price is untenable.  It was in line with many in the sector and of course it will not have escaped notice...
5482 2018-12-30 20:04:05 So you are currently living outside?  Chopping wood for heat,  growing & hunting your own food in clothes you made from tree bark?

Tweeting on a head of lettuce are we?  Lol.  

You depend on oil just as much as me.  Deal with it.

5484 2018-12-30 20:03:53 In Eastern Europe it’s popular to eat something with sunflower or olive oil, while drinking. It helps absorbing more alcohol:)
5485 2018-12-30 20:03:52 OK I meant "Without OIL there is no TEXAS in the XXIst Century" It's easy for the  petty bourgeoisie to scream: "KILL OIL" with no regard for the Oil and Coal working class...
5486 2018-12-30 20:03:51 I had a small case of Asthma when I was younger. I cured myself by taking fish oil tablets, fish oil is good for inflammation. asthma is nothing but inflammation of the lungs
5487 2018-12-30 20:03:48 Yeah. I always use it before bed. I put lavender oil on it and it help me sleep better.
5488 2018-12-30 20:03:46 He also completely starved infrastructure of investment because of an ideological obsession with paying off all debt, which any finance professor would tell you was totally unnecessary, and ended up costing far more in the long run when oil boom came. #abpoli
5489 2018-12-30 20:03:28 Oil diffuser.  never used brand new.
5490 2018-12-30 20:03:15 It's a no brainer, look at the ingredients and don't buy products which contain palm oil. Don't remember having it in the 60's so why do we need it now?
5491 2018-12-30 20:02:59 And here I was thinking that the ending might have changed after the overwhelmingly BAD reception. But nope. Still sucks. Go ahead, put more oil into the fire. Just f*ck off of you‘ve got nothing of value to say @DWAnimation

It smells so nice though. Orange oil for the win.

5502 2018-12-30 20:01:52 How is the economy of such a unification work? Belarus is only marginally reformed for (Russian) capitalism, and Russia is also running out of money due to sanctions and low oil/gas prices.
5503 2018-12-30 20:01:50 Well done Rihanna. Oil prevent the pasta from sticking.
5504 2018-12-30 20:01:41 I covered the cat in coconut oil to help with her fleas and her skin and now she wont leave me alone. Stop following me everywhere! 
5505 2018-12-30 20:01:29 GHG On behalf of the USA that uses our oil (#1 customer, 99% exported goes to USA). So you could cut your demand too....  but your shale oil production is falling and USA economy still needs oil. Maybe we should send you a bill ;)
5506 2018-12-30 20:01:27 sagittarius sun/ leo moon&rising/ aquarius venus. i love frankincense myrrh or eucalyptus spearmint oil and sea island cotton body mist from bath and body works.
5507 2018-12-30 20:01:25 To be honest my mind went straight towards the less kinky CBT oil because I listen to too many podcasts

5509 2018-12-30 20:01:16 His dick is the car oil filter. Most of the time he goes with a Fram. Orange with a grippy black tip.
5510 2018-12-30 20:01:14 Nope. We can all meet our targets and still use oil and not only survive but prosper.
5511 2018-12-30 20:01:09 Hyperbole strikes again. Wall Street Journal article says with the output of shale in North Dakota & Texas it has made the U.S. less dependent on crude oil from others. Many experts say there’s no need to sock away hundreds of millions of barrels of oil as protection of shortages
5512 2018-12-30 20:01:00 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado.
5513 2018-12-30 20:00:58 Is paid lobbying by coal and oil corporations trying to protect their profits, yabbering on about "clean coal" as if that isn't a literal oxymoron

5516 2018-12-30 20:00:44 I WAS CREATED TO CARRY OIL!!! @FREEOFNC @apostlekcurry #sundayworshipservice #reloadseries #lastsundayof2018
5517 2018-12-30 20:00:37 You asked me a question. I gave you an answer (oil companies knew about anthropogenic climate change in the 1980's) and you want more data. I already said that they only dispute this in PR, which is true. What else do you want?
5518 2018-12-30 20:00:31 I can’t believe all the negative reaction to this tweet you would think I was peddling snake oil.  All I was trying to say is if we keep excepting the status quo nothing will ever change. And thank God that guys not my doctor.. “no, healthy lifestyles are bullshit” just smoke
5519 2018-12-30 20:00:30 Yes! My dad made me learn how before he let me get a driver's license. He also made me change the oil, Gap a spark plug, change the oil filter, and change a tire. And parallel park. He wanted to make certain I was ready for anything. :-)

5521 2018-12-30 20:00:23 I mean, that's been around for ever... didn't we used to call it 'student relativism'? *Drifts off into reverie about trying to explain to 1st years that we don't lock children in cupboards or boil them in oil only for reasons of arbitrary social convention.*
5522 2018-12-30 20:00:19 Deflect and distract! It’s a Chiarelli vote of confidence while the team is “depleted.”
5523 2018-12-30 20:00:11 Yep. They always say this. There is a glut on copper worldwide. These operations give jobs for a but, then leave people broke and unemployed. Potable water is strategic resource that we need to consider. The parent company gave us the BP oil spill.
5524 2018-12-30 20:00:11 yup. So I’ll light a candle or something. I’m thinking about copping an oil diffuser too
5525 2018-12-30 19:59:57 You’re like a child.  It’s much more complicated than fuel.  Plastics are in everything and they come from oil.
5526 2018-12-30 19:59:23 Ordinary Gulder, if you now add engine oil nko
5527 2018-12-30 19:59:21 Lithium can be repurposed and recycled, oil cannot.. you cannot take the exhaust of your car and turn it back into oil.. also, Lithium is extracted from brines fields unlike oil which needs drilling into the earth's crust.. BP spill in Gulf of Mexico remember?
5528 2018-12-30 19:59:04 Had that chicken indomie relish today. Really  could have just bought  the 60 nira indomie and poured palm oil inside 
5529 2018-12-30 19:59:01 It's an absolutely horrible manufacture confection full of palm oil and corn syrup. They taste like childhood so we love them. They're a half-assed pound cake finger shape, with vanilla alleged cream filling.
5530 2018-12-30 19:58:49 "One thing that Egypt has done successfully over the last hundred and twenty years is developing their oil and gas sector. That is a big sector, as is tourism. Mining certainly has the ability to do that in the future -- to become a major factor." @AtonResources @KerryLutz
5531 2018-12-30 19:58:47 It is a funny Italian (mis?)translation of pasta with five onions! You caramelize a sweet onion and soften red onion, leek, green onion, and garlic in butter and oil and grate in ricotta salata and it's SO decadent. Recipe is from @mollyorangette.
5532 2018-12-30 19:58:42 There is a lot of evidence now the ingredients for gas and oil were present at the creation of Earth and the planet has been making it since the beginning. The rare Earths used in making batteries will run out sooner than any fossil fuel.
5533 2018-12-30 19:58:41 Got so mad at Andrew bc I was cold and I needed to pee and he was walking too fast, so he bought me CBD oil hot chocolate.

5538 2018-12-30 19:57:50 Tesla is the only OEM that focuses on electric cars. All the others are selling mostly fuel powered vehicles that do not need charging stations. That's why the others don't invest in charging infrastructure. Filling stations are then independently provided by the Oil companies.
5539 2018-12-30 19:57:45 Yes it is but what’s your solution. It is the fault of elected officials trying to stay in power. President Carter told America what they needed to do to stay independent of oil. President Bush had to go back on a no new taxes promise. Both one term presidents. It has to change.
5540 2018-12-30 19:57:42 They call it regressive conservatism. We revert from governing by facts, science and hard truths to governing by greed, beliefs, desires and wishful thinking. We move from a period of enlightenment to a dark age. #Environment #MAGA #Coal #Oil
5541 2018-12-30 19:57:41 Why do you think God placed you on the coast? So you can steal oil tankers and rob ferries as your main source of income
5542 2018-12-30 19:57:40 Gave any money or spent it recklessly without investing it for the inevitable downturn in a volatile industry, like other oil rich nations did (ie Norway).
5543 2018-12-30 19:57:26 I’ve followed the Oil closely for my 18 years living in Edm. It’s sad to see this silliness continue year after year. Strome was a glue guy that was decent but didn’t score enough. So we trade him for a guy that will prob be waived soon. Too bad.. Petro is another 3rd pair D.
5544 2018-12-30 19:57:21 John Kelly has admitted that there was never going to be a wall, & Trump has always known that. Instead it’ll be more like a fence, if at all. He’s merely been peddling snake oil.
5545 2018-12-30 19:57:16 Snake oil salesman.
5546 2018-12-30 19:57:16 THANK you. If I was a certified baker, clearly I wouldn’t have a problem with leaving butter out. But I just cook. I use olive oil most of the time anyway.
5547 2018-12-30 19:57:11 Lol.  You rely on oil for survival just as much as the rest of us.
5548 2018-12-30 19:57:10 Keep feeding the rhetoric with your own Jason big oil shill Kenney.
5549 2018-12-30 19:56:55 Ravensara essential oil, in an oil burner or one of those diffuser things. Keep it going overnight while you sleep, there's nothing better.
5550 2018-12-30 19:56:37 Try pressing the dough thin and bake for @ 7 minutes with nothing but a brushing of olive oil on, then put sauce , cheese, other things on to finish off. Crust will be crispy thin.
5551 2018-12-30 19:56:37 Trying essential oil blending for the first time and I already love this weird ass scent I made it's frankincense, cedarwood, geranium, and lemon in a sweet almond carrier oil
5552 2018-12-30 19:56:30 Totally debunked. It was started by a British doctor, Andrew Wakefield who used terrible methodology & was peddling some alternative med snake oil. Scared lots of people & caused plenty of deaths from vaccine-preventable illness. He’s lost his license but his influence remains
5553 2018-12-30 19:56:21 2018-19 season... If Liverpool win the league it’s all city’s fault.                      
2017-18 season... city won the league with oil money.

5555 2018-12-30 19:56:17 There are two health trends that I really want to get into every time I hear about them: oil pulling and drinking celery juice. Then I have to remind myself that oil pulling can ruin my permanent retainers and I’m allergic to celery so I probably shouldn’t drink a head every day
5556 2018-12-30 19:56:11 is the oil decarbed already? If not, how would one go about that? ty

5559 2018-12-30 19:56:00 I just stepped up to 10% CBD oil from 5%. It mellowed me the fck out. Drinking homemade cocktails with my wife's family at my home.
5560 2018-12-30 19:55:57 Campari taste like motor oil
5561 2018-12-30 19:55:46 No, I add vitamin e, tea tree oil, and vegetable glycerin to it to help with the moisture.
5562 2018-12-30 19:55:39 Acres and acres of vacant development land at Lough Atalia Road, in public ownership too, just waiting to be built on! Former Leeside Oil terminal cleared ready for car parking, pending any plans to actually build anything there. What too about Connacht Laundry site, being sat on
5563 2018-12-30 19:55:35 Hi Iceland! Just to let you know I do agree with Natasha that you’ve done a wonderful job in raising awareness of unsustainable palm oil! Now hopefully we will achieve sustainability much sooner with the increase in public backing you’ve created. Thank you
5564 2018-12-30 19:55:34 Yes.
"What Does Earl Grey Tea Actually Taste Like? Since the tea has oil of bergamot oranges, it has a citrus aroma and a strong flavor."
5565 2018-12-30 19:55:27 Its still a finite resource! It will run out eventually! Please help me understand why would we wanna depend on oil (finite resource) when there are other sustainable sources available? Also, the technology available to scientists in 70 was vastly inferior to today's technology..
5566 2018-12-30 19:55:21 I skip both flour and sugar, but add salt. Frying in good olive oil makes it so tasty
5567 2018-12-30 19:55:07 It’s the peanut oil that makes them excited
5568 2018-12-30 19:54:55 lmao seeing this meme earlier this week is what sent me back to checking oil Instagram 
5569 2018-12-30 19:54:45 They believe wholly in a god they have no evidence exists, but deny the reality of climate change without even considering the evidence. They are just oil industry dupes.
5570 2018-12-30 19:54:44 I was made to be 'the wick' that links the oil to the flame, burning out but creating illumination in return. I am 'the light' of the world.
5571 2018-12-30 19:54:43 This is what they want people to do,

MAKE A QUICK DECISION, not thinking of the repercussions
ACTING OUT OF EMOTION, never wins

These secrete technologies, have been tucked away, patented, so BIG OIL could continue control,

Is it really that hard to see ?
5572 2018-12-30 19:54:32 Sorry I usually agree with your forecasts but not for oil.
5573 2018-12-30 19:54:25 I suppose I could learn to read. But it wouldn't make any of your points logical. I really don't care much about Syria. It is a shame about those 200 soldiers though. Russia lost a lot for Syria. A jet and pilot to Turkey. A jet to Israel. Did that pilot survive? 200 men for oil.
5574 2018-12-30 19:54:11 1. Slowly melt cocoa butter and coco oil
2. Pour it and other ingredients together and mix it until similar to cookie dough
3. Spread out the dough on baking paper, sprinkle it with cocoa powder and stretch it to thin it out
4. Cut small squares and fridge it
5575 2018-12-30 19:54:07 My oil furnace is set to 80 and all my windows are open!! Let those skidoos warm up for at least a half hour before riding them!!
5576 2018-12-30 19:53:24 Also, need inspection, enforcement of storm water retention plans. They're traps for oil, grease, & heavy metals. Need removal, safe disposal of sediment in them. Commercial sites don't want to pay the costs, so once silted up, ineffective.
5577 2018-12-30 19:53:15 Depends on the oil you use might spend 70$ at 5 minute oil change .
5578 2018-12-30 19:53:08 Big Oil companies invest heavily in gas stations. 

No big electric companies doing the same thing as profits don’t exist for the limited number of electric cars on the road.

By the time there is a critical mass - it’ll be too late for them.
5579 2018-12-30 19:53:02 I asked nae what color girl she wanna fw lightskin or dark skin she gone say dark skin I can put oil on her butt it’s gone be glistening 
5580 2018-12-30 19:52:55 Protests don't work. Need to gather up tens of thousands of oil workers and take a trip to Ottawa, go see Trudeau personally.
5581 2018-12-30 19:52:51 Every mom on Facebook thinks they're  the dad from Lorenzo's Oil.
5582 2018-12-30 19:52:24 Hasn’t seen oil since ww1
5583 2018-12-30 19:52:20 The Hunts & Precourt's old man were tight Haliburton & Oil buddies.
5584 2018-12-30 19:52:07 Bloomberg's done great #ClimateAction via BNEF + shutting coal, but #carbontax + DIVIDEND creates Perverse Incentive: dividend creates a voter constituency to keep using dirty energy to keep receiving $$$. 

That's how Alaska keeps its voters supporting oil.
5585 2018-12-30 19:51:51 Your head Get Good Brian oil Some people don't have any reason to talk they just say shit #positivevibes
5586 2018-12-30 19:51:44 It’s so disappointing to see Christine Elliott purportedly mislead her constituents. Watching the PC government take credit for the global drop in oil prices is embarrassing
5587 2018-12-30 19:51:29 LOL, he has the body of Olive Oil.
5588 2018-12-30 19:51:26 Does anyone have any recommendations for a good cleanser that’s for dry sensitive skin but can also take off make up? I haven’t ordered my banila co oil cleanser yet so I need a cleanser that removes make up until I get it.
5589 2018-12-30 19:51:20 coconut oil is literally life.
5590 2018-12-30 19:51:08 Apparently. He thinks the federal government should dictate to private companies who they buy oil from and how much and also overrule court decisions to impose his own.
5591 2018-12-30 19:50:54 Yeah, I think this is more regional than I imagined. In Liverpool it's all vegetable oil.
5592 2018-12-30 19:50:52 Sad but true. It’s just so poorly planned. The only ppl benefiting from our anti pipeline decisions are the American consumers. They get to buy our oil for 50% off!
5593 2018-12-30 19:50:29 I’ve only ever owned cars with manual transmissions. Took it for an oil change last year and they told me the brake lights were out. I thought it was weird both lights were out so they checked again. Guy had confused the brake pedal with the clutch pedal. :|

5597 2018-12-30 19:50:17 If we are to keep #Fossilfuels in the ground then in 2019 we will need to make less car journeys & less flights & cruises. This means big changes to Western economies. While the demand is there #Oil corps will keep supplying diesel & petrol. We need to change @ExtinctionR
5598 2018-12-30 19:50:11 Avocado oil & argon oil ? Avocado worked well too. I recommend
5599 2018-12-30 19:50:10 The Canadian Taxpayer Federation have been great lobbyists for the oil and gas industry even though that has little to with Canadians paying taxes.

5608 2018-12-30 19:48:47 US had only 2,000. Helping rebels fight ISIS. And Assad's troops when attacked. I know not of Ghouta or Deraa. I do know that the US, unfortunately, had to wipe out 200 Russian soldiers. The Tsar betrayed them for oil profits.
5609 2018-12-30 19:48:46 Viscous? Like oil?
5610 2018-12-30 19:48:43 Did the oil execs expect a drop in regulations in exchange for agreeing with carbon taxing?
5611 2018-12-30 19:48:15 sana oil
5612 2018-12-30 19:48:15 Castor oil, tea tree oil, cantu works for me but ik alot of people don’t like it so, but invest in hair masks, particularly a deep conditioning mint one (apply it after a shampoo , let it sit with a shower cap, detangle before washing it out) , ALOT of protective styles.
5613 2018-12-30 19:48:15 3. The colonizer will them generaly put in place a puppet or a yes coloniser leader and sell oil for instance at a dollar to them and ensure that no order ever comes to that place.
5614 2018-12-30 19:48:14 And why am I not surprised to see you posting Oil propaganda nonsense?

5619 2018-12-30 19:47:29 I very much doubt that there is much overlap of interests bar money.

They back the Right because they are anti-neo con, love oil & gas & are corrupt.

That's as far as it goes

The right want to trade with Russia, the centrists want to wipe them off the map, easy choice really
5620 2018-12-30 19:47:28 It is.  What’s even more sad is that I know a few people who are very intelligent who tow this same party line.  A friend of mine is a computer programmer at a Long Beach chevron oil refinery, and I have spent many frustrating hours trying to show him study after study.

5624 2018-12-30 19:47:15 Nobody has done more to harm wild salmon than the Suzuki Foundation, through promoting less-safe oil transportation and shilling for commercial salmon interests. Moreover, Suzuki is propping up the Trump oil agenda. Pretty pathetic really.
5625 2018-12-30 19:46:56 and that’s oil, not water

I am not saying fossils fuels are not helping, NOR BIG OIL but I promise you
RESEARCH FOR YOURSELF
Youtube is the quickest way to get validated OPINIONS from many people and form your own conclusions, instead of "PARROTING'

That's the point, but your mind is SMALL

Yeah.  All cars fixed.

Can’t work on an oil and gas site without being clean shaven. You probably knew that.  It’s my YouTube trademark. I need to grow it back.

5635 2018-12-30 19:46:03 Also Quebec doesn’t want Alberta oil as profits are made by a select few who import from Saudi Arabia. Those who control the ports/long shoreman pay off the politicians in Quebec. It’s a gravy train of foreign oil...
5636 2018-12-30 19:45:31 Because the oil industry is the culprit.
5637 2018-12-30 19:45:18 I have asked Manuel Perez to not shave or  cut his hair for about 6 months to a year and to get a gym card during that time; after all this he will be buying body oil to rub all over himself; Wallah I will have my very own Aquaman, AquaManWheel :D — watching Aquaman
5638 2018-12-30 19:45:16 Me!!! Please mate... Havent got out of bed yet. Feel like I've got an oil drum full of jelly beans on my head :-(
5639 2018-12-30 19:45:01 @GirlTalkZA I need help to minimise the appearance of stretch marks just below my azz all the way to back of my kneesp. I feel SOOO uncomfortable when wearing short things. BIO OIL DID NOT WORK FOR ME AT ALL!!!
5640 2018-12-30 19:44:58 Too complicated and more expensive than electric. The need for an extra step to get Hydrogen is abundant. Where does the Hydrogen come from? Is it grey, blue or green? Like electricity. Where does it come from? Coal, oil, nuclair, wind or sun?
5641 2018-12-30 19:44:57 Nope. Not at all actually. You pour baking soda all over the oil and it’s not slippery anymore. Scrape it all together and clean what’s left. Makes for an easier, safer cleanup.
5642 2018-12-30 19:44:53 ‘No ships and no trading history’? So basically the government is giving out contracts to spivs proffering snake oil.
5643 2018-12-30 19:44:40 Small cubes of yam mixed with large cubes of eggplant. A little olive oil, garam masala, smoked or even regular paprika. Thank me later.
5644 2018-12-30 19:44:40 seems to me your just another hypocrite. explain what you have done. your still 7sing an oil based product as u are on twitter so tjats not it
5645 2018-12-30 19:44:36 Chiedo rispetto per mio fratello @DiMarzio. Non paragoniamolo a Tuna Oil.
5646 2018-12-30 19:44:32 มีพี่หนูก็ไม่งอแงแล้ว *ไขว้นิ้ว*
5647 2018-12-30 19:44:24 Turkey hoagie. Amoroso roll. Has to be turkey breast, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions, hot peppers, mayo, oil.
5648 2018-12-30 19:44:16 Oh piss off Brett. The oil industry invests billion based on climate predictions in planning for oil rigs, but when the SAME DATA shows certain future increases in temperature, you pretend it's bunk.
5649 2018-12-30 19:44:14 And Gadafi was killed for gold and oil, and to intentionally destabilize the middle east.  And Benghazi happened because Hillary and Obama were running guns to rebels in Syria. And then came ISIS.  Trump is right. GET OUT OF SYRIA!
5650 2018-12-30 19:44:11 Can I fantasize you putting together an IKEA shelf wearing only leopard thongs and your body covered in lavender scented oil?
5651 2018-12-30 19:44:09 I’m trying to tweet all I can, cos when I get up there next week on that oil field , it’s strictly business, gotta stay focus
5652 2018-12-30 19:44:04 I have been there three times, and the oil increase has been a problem for more than a year. I have had problems with the new car since then, and I hope Honda can buy back my car
5653 2018-12-30 19:44:04 Pull off the road near a cornfield, grab a shotgun, shoot a couple crows, pkuck it's feathers, remove intestines, add some if your favorite spices, rub them in with some olive oil, place on grill until the juices are clear. Share with your Dad and enjoy!!!!
5654 2018-12-30 19:43:49 baby oil & dove soap >>>
5655 2018-12-30 19:43:45 I have been there three times, and the oil increase has been a problem for more than a year. I have had problems with the new car since then, and I hope Honda can buy back my car
5656 2018-12-30 19:43:43 It’s the Depression.....and now the headache has gotten worse.......none of this goes away unless the Oil win a game....if they go on an actual streak, my body adjusts and I feel like a million bucks......
5657 2018-12-30 19:43:43 In your sweater to slowly take it off of you and kiss you all over as I massage your gorgeous body with warm coconut oil.
5658 2018-12-30 19:43:32 All they have the carefully crafted facade of evidence that oil company lobbyists, politicians and conservative news outlets have spent billions of dollars over the last two decades to create the appearance of a debate or “healthy skepticism”.  I can cite my sources.
5659 2018-12-30 19:42:38 Agree...oil is down AND taxes were cut too. 

Far better to thank government whenever we can. We will have tonnes of opportunity to criticize some other time.
5660 2018-12-30 19:42:33 Drink your caster oil
5661 2018-12-30 19:42:28 bitch if you were an olive oil, you’d be extra virgin
5662 2018-12-30 19:42:25 I know my mom said the key it to part your hair and put the product through your (kinda like when you part and grease/oil your hair) and to slick it down section by section. Start from the back and move to the front or vice versa.
5663 2018-12-30 19:42:24 Tastes the best but so much fat and oil in it 
5664 2018-12-30 19:42:22 .Then you should be lobbying for the industry to give back ALL the oil subsidies it has ever gotten, still gets, and is promised through tax breaks.

Clearly you don't know anything about the former or the latter because you support the wrong people for both.
5665 2018-12-30 19:42:04 Am I the only woman who gets really anxious before getting an oil change? I’ve never even had a negative oil change experience before, that environment is just pulsing with so much testosterone that it’s overwhelming
5666 2018-12-30 19:41:56 love me when my natural hair dry and need water & oil
5667 2018-12-30 19:41:46 Why not interview indigenous peoples whose rights have been trampled in the ill-advised rush to capitalize on peak (tarsands) oil?
5668 2018-12-30 19:41:41 I refuse to use it at work because it’s gonna make me associate it with BMs. I use oil of wintergreen for that. 
5669 2018-12-30 19:41:19 Why am I getting spam mail from CBD oil companies? Don't they know I only want the best?  That's why I buy @cloudn9nesyrup & @BuyLegaIMeds ? I wouldn't trust anyone else! 
5670 2018-12-30 19:41:12 oil of oregano and alien super healing powers probably
5671 2018-12-30 19:41:10 Am eating mine willingly with miyan kubewa bushasshiya, plus kayan chiki
5672 2018-12-30 19:41:05 Couldn’t care less about a Russian oil money fan (discovered 2003)
5673 2018-12-30 19:40:58 Why are you lying about this? What carbon tax? Why have gas prices also dropped in the US if carbon tax has anything to do with it? And why are you taking credit...unless your government manipulates the price of crude oil?
5674 2018-12-30 19:40:54 He talks...people listen as message resonates. This conversation is relevant to many and discounting as snake oil, glib glob or whatever other acronym doesn’t change the fact. I sense a touch of jealousy in your tone..he sure get a lot of attention doesn’t he 
5675 2018-12-30 19:40:48 JEHOVAH GOD OF HOST TOLD ME:I´VE BEEN BETRAYED MANY TIMES;MY OWN CHILDREN BETRAY ME EVERY TIME THEY CAN! EVEN SO I LOVE THEM! IN THE JESUS CHRIST NAME AMEN, AMEN AND AMEN!
I GIVE A HUG TO JEHOVAH I WAS CRYING AND HIS TEARS WERE LIKE BRIGHT AND SHINING OIL,AMN
5676 2018-12-30 19:40:36 @mattgaetz a machine? Please!
Maybe a machine that is leaking oil & the wheels are falling off. U are the devin nunes of the right coast!
5677 2018-12-30 19:40:35 @simonrim your potatoes on @SundayBrunchC4 this morning cooked in sugar, oil, garlic then finished with salt and balsamic......what a winner!! 
5678 2018-12-30 19:40:27 I agree, sadly once again it’s the little guys asked to spend every thing on the cause.  A few hrs around town is one thing.... driving a picker truck across Canada is basically ruining that equipment. And would bankrupt a small business.

5682 2018-12-30 19:40:19 Just small coconut oil and breast milk diet regime lol
5683 2018-12-30 19:40:19 Learning about a lot of cool and good and incredibly safe stuff from essential oil instagram (oil pulling, consuming essential oils and using them to season food)

5686 2018-12-30 19:40:01 I felt like I drank a lot of efficascent oil drink today.  give me a lot of jose cuervo or bacardi I’d be happy gulping not that damn jägerbomb
5687 2018-12-30 19:39:52 Praying for the oil Boys to win again and no one to give a shit
5688 2018-12-30 19:39:48 HOW DO YOU GET FENTY FOUNDATION (OIL BASED FOUNDATION) OFF CLOTHING??? Normal detergent doesn’t work...
5689 2018-12-30 19:39:44 I know exactly where our oil comes from.

A free market is just that, free! It's not a market where a government actively works to impinge on it and restrict it like our current federal government does only to the benefit of foreign concerns.
5690 2018-12-30 19:39:38 With these rumors in mind, I cannot express the feelings I experienced sitting in Lucas Oil Stadium and watching him repeatedly miss targets 10 yards or less from him
5691 2018-12-30 19:39:36 I'm willing to spread the baby oil ANYTIME!!
5692 2018-12-30 19:39:35 lol oil sheikhs unconcerned with dystopian AI catastrophe
5693 2018-12-30 19:39:29 Oil pulling feels GROSS but then great and worth it and cool
5694 2018-12-30 19:39:27 Castor oil!
5695 2018-12-30 19:39:23 Oil needs you...the king needs you
5696 2018-12-30 19:39:20 Whatever they need to do to ignore the border crisis!
5697 2018-12-30 19:39:20 This is the best you got Bob?  Fought Kane 3 times and can make a decent 1st pass.  This is worth a 3rd round pick?  Brayden Point was a 3rd round pick.  Considering what the Oil have for scouting.  Might as well...
5698 2018-12-30 19:39:16 My brother does oil changes
5699 2018-12-30 19:39:14 coconut oil in coffee is the move
5700 2018-12-30 19:39:07 Oil & Lubricant industry will come to an end soon!
5701 2018-12-30 19:38:58 Don't understand what? That ruining the climate pays off on the long run?
Investment in coal and oil is the future? Lying is the new truth?
5702 2018-12-30 19:38:53 Coconut oil sis 
5703 2018-12-30 19:38:23 Roy is an oil worker. Sniffed too many fumes or too many pipes to the head.
5704 2018-12-30 19:38:13 Mom bought CBD oil because my brother made her. She will use it bc it was $$$, not bc I begged her to try it.
5705 2018-12-30 19:38:13 Hope you're being sarcastic. Drop in price is Canada-wide and is due to current global oil price drop. Analysts have all said prices will go back up globally in 2019...
5706 2018-12-30 19:38:07 sooo i’m sitting here doing a face mask, listening to my vinyl of lana del rey, next to my “uplifting” essential oil diffuser. i’ve reached max gay. someone save me from myself.
5707 2018-12-30 19:37:45 griffin was dominant for the oil kings!
5708 2018-12-30 19:37:44 Olive leaf extract or oregano oil will kill anything except you.
5709 2018-12-30 19:37:29 Just fine, thanks.

Grew up not too far from Sooke.

Things have a funny way of being fairly similar wherever, depending on the resource sector in one's region.

Forestry has the same kind knuckle draggers as are anywhere. Oil included.
5710 2018-12-30 19:37:22 Wondering why I smell coconut oil?
5711 2018-12-30 19:37:20 Good luck Petro! A solid shutdown D man. Remember, defense is part of the game too. Not all about putting pucks in the net, but keeping them out as well and Petro will do that for you. He’s no Ryan McDonaugh, but will help the Oil. 
5712 2018-12-30 19:37:07 Oil is dead 
5713 2018-12-30 19:36:58 just think.. in a few years you will be able to tell people that you were instrumental in helping to destroy the world from supporting oil and gas use. It is very simple, you are either helping or making the pollution worse.
5714 2018-12-30 19:36:52 He will never approve of anything that will help the oil and gas industry. He's clinging to the UN/ParisClimate Accord like a rabid Limpet.
His legacy will be: Canada: 1st country off fossil fuels (millions freeze)
5715 2018-12-30 19:36:36 Oil....hhhhh
5716 2018-12-30 19:36:25 Through the four head-to-head games between the Oil Kings and the Rebels so far this season, @Rebelshockey goalie Ethan Anders has faced 158 shots and allowed 9 goals. 

That's a .943 sv%

5717 2018-12-30 19:36:02 When a oil rich nation state owns your club and dodges Fifa Fair Play with phony deals with the state owned airline, I’d say you’re pretty plastic.
5718 2018-12-30 19:36:00 DEAR INASAL... BAKIT WALA KAYO CHICKEN OIL?!?! You Made me Broke... Charot!!
5719 2018-12-30 19:35:48 MOM  thank u I love you. Yes definitely about the oil! I also used a shit ton of product to try & tame it, so I’m sure that contributed. The weirdest part is, my hair was tied up 97% of the time, I rarely ever had it down. I  it short for now, just figured I’d ask around .
5720 2018-12-30 19:35:29 I’m so glad I got synthetic oil this time
5721 2018-12-30 19:34:57 Have you tried a oil based makeup remover?
5722 2018-12-30 19:34:54 @CaudalieUS hey girl did y’all discontinue the Divine Oil orrrrrr
5723 2018-12-30 19:34:52 can’t believe ya still scared of some oil popping, grow up
5724 2018-12-30 19:34:44 Why are all the  climate proclamations of the future made by a computer where humans input data. It’s all a model that humans have complete control over and can create any outcome!! All are 50-100 years away and know one will be alive to prove them wrong.
5725 2018-12-30 19:34:43 All numbers from chevy and Audi websites, includes all taxes and incentives. 

Includes all-in Audi care service.

Your oil "subsidies' also serve your whole food chain, that you would starve without. Planes. Buses. Trucks. Trains. Ships. etc.
5726 2018-12-30 19:34:31 We really needed some toughness that is been a huge issue in @EdmontonOilers current slide so if the Oil were provide a decent challenge to the @NHLFlames and the @NHLJets in the West, it’s Petrovic mental toughness and grit which it’s going to be huge for the Oil. #LetsGoOilers
5727 2018-12-30 19:34:24 Butts and Trudeau want to kill the oil industry.  That’s very well documented historically.  Buying TMX to make sure it’s never developed and installing Bill C69 to choke our all investment in this sector is working very well for them.  What a missed opportunity for Canadians.
5728 2018-12-30 19:33:56 Meanwhile the Tories in Alberta are screaming about low oil prices as a disaster. 
5729 2018-12-30 19:33:54 Man still got some oil on those springs.
5730 2018-12-30 19:33:50 Sadly coconut oil don’t work for me 
5731 2018-12-30 19:33:40 Your car Japanese.Your Vodka Russian,pizza Italian,kebab Turkish,democracy Greek,coffee Brazilian, movies American.Your oil Saudi Arabian.Your electronics Chinese,Your numbers Arabic,your letters Latin.And you complain that your neighbour is an immigrant?Pull yourself together
5732 2018-12-30 19:33:38 You could go a lil while, but just make sure you don’t run out of oil
5733 2018-12-30 19:33:37 Hi Adam 

That’s oil, I guess 
Bullish AF
5734 2018-12-30 19:33:36 @SarahPalinUSA Mary Queen of Scots will stop with this when it comes to getting the throne that never was hers back. She bought some 100 percent pure snake oil that Lucifer sold her.
5735 2018-12-30 19:33:33 Oh my word. I campaigned for people to be able to use CBD...for the things it actually helps. Snake oil salesman like that are so harmful!
It makes you wanna pull your hair out.
5736 2018-12-30 19:33:30 How will things change unless we get big money out of politics? How can things change if we vote for candidates that Wall Street and oil and gas love?
5737 2018-12-30 19:33:24 .Then you have no idea where you oil comes from, or how a free market works.

Don't like it?

Look at government statistics for the first, and your conservative supporting oil refineries back east who make the purchases.
5738 2018-12-30 19:33:19 They might not be finished. They might be finished. Who really knows with those cheeky Oil men
5739 2018-12-30 19:33:03 The protest isn’t about one pipeline. It’s about the home made oil crisis and the war on AB O&G. The entire country needs to understand the damage being done to the national economy. That message can best be delivered from Ottawa.
5740 2018-12-30 19:32:45 NOT just illegal immigration but PSYCHO TRUMP and his puppets..Natl. parks losing acreage, fracking,oil drilling,climate change,etc. ALL THIS has been done in the last 2 yrs of PSYCHO'S term..& we have 2yrs left..Folks PRAY for America..
5741 2018-12-30 19:32:44 Dm me pls
5742 2018-12-30 19:32:35 Is er een engels woord voor? Oil balls? 
5743 2018-12-30 19:32:32 Telling people what they want to hear is also the stock in trade of every flim-flam man and snake oil salesman trying to part unsophisticated rubes from their money.
5744 2018-12-30 19:32:26 You can use coconut oil and Florida water to cleanse your space , will not leave residue and it will also bless the space
5745 2018-12-30 19:32:25 All the more reason to fight for oil!!! For Union Trades income for families.
5746 2018-12-30 19:32:18 Coconut oil might work. I moisturized my hair with it every week and it sped up my growth process
5747 2018-12-30 19:32:14 When I was a kid I was so amazed that adults seem not to feel the pain of burning hot cooking oil while frying. Now I understand. It’s not that they don’t feel it, they endure it—adults need to, we need to. That’s what adulting means: enduring pain.
5748 2018-12-30 19:32:09 oil and gas industry, natch
5749 2018-12-30 19:32:06 Stand up pls 
5750 2018-12-30 19:31:49 Frying pan. Olive oil. Slice of good bread. Fry that sucker until it’s golden brown. (Finer temptress) 

It’s delicious!
5751 2018-12-30 19:31:40 Yet another story unrelated to why those that support the oil and gas industry are about.
5752 2018-12-30 19:31:40 Gonna turn into that annoying ass homeopathic bitch now that I have an oil diffuser to put my essential oils in
5753 2018-12-30 19:31:40 Another Edmonton born native which Petrovic and now Hitch are from E-Town! Now I am happy to hear that the Oil are getting some serious talent in their homegrown talent. #LetsGoOilers
5754 2018-12-30 19:31:31 During the year of Ramadah (=famine) 'Umar Ibn al Khattāb would eat only bread and olive oil. He would say:

"What a bad leader I am, if I am full and the people are hungry!"
5755 2018-12-30 19:31:08 This has nothing to do with PC politics, and everything to do with the volatile oil industry. Are you planning on taking the blame when the markets change and prices go back up?
5756 2018-12-30 19:31:00 cooking oil
5757 2018-12-30 19:30:56 for as long as oil is a precious commodity.. id say no

5765 2018-12-30 19:30:17 if the Israelis were so interested in kurdish freedom why were they buying kurdish oil at 50% to the dollar and blocking negotiations to give them a seat in the oil markets?
5766 2018-12-30 19:30:13 You should see the actual joy that I get rubbing Moroccan Oil into My boyfriend's beard. It's like pampering a bear. 
5767 2018-12-30 19:30:09 Total  bull spit, winter gas always cheaper and world wide glut thanks to Russia, Saudi and USA flooding the market to destroy their competition guess who that is? The AB oil patch.
5768 2018-12-30 19:30:07 hmmmm .wars for power and resources... can we talk about the bullshit murder of Ghadafi for Gold, and oil.. and how about Syria.. now there's a bullshit war we could get behind.. Hillary selling guns to the rebels and letting our folks in Benghazi get overrun to cover.
5769 2018-12-30 19:30:04 Trump’s #wall is the U.S. version of #Brexit, a half-assed idea conjured up by Putin-funded bullshit artists, grifters, hustlers and snake oil sales representatives, motivated by xenophobia and a desire to return to the glory days that never existed.

5776 2018-12-30 19:29:09 Really?  What has CBC published on the anti oil side?
5777 2018-12-30 19:29:03 Ya, so now that you have pointed out they have high jacked the yellow vest group in Alberta to futher their bs...
Stop telling lies that it's one and the same as the oil and gas supporters rallies.
5778 2018-12-30 19:29:02 looks like you want to prop up some Obama 2.0 garbage and throw another oil man to the top of the heap.
5779 2018-12-30 19:29:01 --white pepper, onion and garlic. We will need some oil as well.”  a pause followed "By the way are you tired?" he said smiling as he noticed her yawn.
5780 2018-12-30 19:28:58 No oil painting is she ...
5781 2018-12-30 19:28:46 Good running Poulan pro snowblower with electric start. Fresh oil change, new skid plates and inner snow chute has been replaced. Just used during this last storm with no issues. Let me know if you have any questions.
5782 2018-12-30 19:28:41 In the last 24 hrs there were a total of 5 oil product tankers in the ports of Quebec City and Montreal. Yet according to Quebec Premier François Legault, there is no social acceptability for oil in Quebec.

5783 2018-12-30 19:28:35 “Albertans, are far from accepting this future. Our govts pine for infinite growth in our oil and gas sector. There is a real sense that anyone advocating for a safe climate is treasonous; The two of us are likely to be among the first up against the wall in the coming turmoil.“
5784 2018-12-30 19:28:30 Facts
Last summer, China slashed U.S. oil imports and started to buy more Russia and Saudi Arabia.
It has all but halted purchases of U.S. soybeans, buying them instead from Brazil and Argentina, says Brad Setser, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations
5785 2018-12-30 19:28:25 The first time I heard Obama label our oil, ‘dirty oil’, I knew that was the beginning of a power struggle we would lose!
5786 2018-12-30 19:28:18 Justine's tissue oil moisturizing body scrub and body balance firming cellulite gel cream seems to be working for me
5787 2018-12-30 19:28:16 Techno fantasy like the higher tier weapons? Nope, all cannons and old school pistols here. The most high tech thing I have seen is a forge and a lantern that uses fish oil.
5788 2018-12-30 19:28:15 Trader Joe’s vegan chicken tenders are the best!! Just fry them at a hot temperature in a little oil & they crisp up so well. Amy’s and Gardein has a lot of good frozen vegan dishes. And nutritional yeast seasoning is a must!
5789 2018-12-30 19:28:01 They cut some off the ppe and filled it with fuel and oil so I guess I’ll take that
5790 2018-12-30 19:27:57 So I took my makeup off with almond oil and YALL
5791 2018-12-30 19:27:56 なんかきゃすする（）
5792 2018-12-30 19:27:54 I put my husband's beard oil on my eyebrows so I can smell him on me all day 
5793 2018-12-30 19:27:43 Use the plant ? Or they said like the oil in stores ?
5794 2018-12-30 19:27:23 Feel like i literally need to drown myself in olbas oil to feel better 
5795 2018-12-30 19:27:13 On OIL, Andy Hall : "..the US shale production is the great (unimaginable) - imponderable..."that, presently,there are "headwinds on demands", but asserts, trajectory is to the UP, but of course.
5796 2018-12-30 19:27:12 You seem to be the only one talking about pipelines in the context of this article @Greenpeace.  The article is about electricity generation. Nothing to do with pipelines. Not much oil is used to generate electricity. And nat gas is displacing coal. Get smart.
5797 2018-12-30 19:27:12 Pan fried onions pancakes remind me of my mom making them ... Rowing the dough.. add oil to pan.  Asian parents know our fav foods. Its their humble way of saying they  you.
5798 2018-12-30 19:26:53 I think the smaller issue of oil based emissions will partly solve itself through electric cars.
5799 2018-12-30 19:26:53 Mine either. I think I need to fly to Africa. Get some beard oil from the motherland.
5800 2018-12-30 19:26:50 Swear half the city wear the same oil
5801 2018-12-30 19:26:30 Coconut oil! That’s what worked for us just a pea size amount
5802 2018-12-30 19:26:23 They are everywhere. Just blocked about 20+ today myself. Love that they are all officers in the military, work on oil rigs or Arabian princes. It's when they send creepy DM's that I first report, then block. Not fooling me with their broken English.
5803 2018-12-30 19:26:21 #birdbox but instead of blindfolds, it’s  nose plugs and instead of demons, they’re Lush employees forcing you to smell the new hibiscus infused bath oil that just came in
5804 2018-12-30 19:26:14 I cannot do anything to save my life, out here getting an oil change and I hit my head on my car then I go the opposite direction of where the lobby is lmao kms
5805 2018-12-30 19:26:08 Russia has bases in Syria long before the war started and if you didn't know one of the reasons for the war was because Syria won't allow the Saudi/Qatar oil/gas pipelines going through Syria which would hurt Russias exports to Turkey. Russia has zero intention to leave Syria.
5806 2018-12-30 19:25:59 One day we, the people you steal from, will come for you and wipe you from the face of the earth. Revolution is coming. Steal while you can.
5807 2018-12-30 19:25:59 LOL bringing jobs back is lucky ? Tax cuts is lucky ? Becoming dominant exporter of oil is lucky ? Son please
5808 2018-12-30 19:25:57 I do not support politicians in favour of bills C-48 and C-69 that support oil production from regimes like Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and other such nefarious regimes.
5809 2018-12-30 19:25:57 Try any oils. Coconut, Olive, or baby oil. It should helps!
5810 2018-12-30 19:25:53 Yup, I once saw whales from coal oil point. It's warm enough here to play with them without a wet suit :))
5811 2018-12-30 19:25:52 I’m a grown man you think I’m gonna pay another grown man to change my engine oil?
5812 2018-12-30 19:25:34 The last person to have a serious discussion was Jimmy Carter when he said we would run out of oil.
5813 2018-12-30 19:25:20 Congressista estúpido, tudo isso é graças a Dilma quando ministra da Casa Civil no governo  Lula. 

Pagaram US$ 360 milhões em 50% da refinaria,  um ano antes a belga Astra Oil tinha pago US$ 42,5 milhões na refinaria inteira. 

 Prejuízo de US$ 1,2 bilhão segundo o TCU.
5814 2018-12-30 19:25:10 Just cleaned the deep fryer... fresh oil... if you know me you know what’s bout to fucking happen.
5815 2018-12-30 19:25:01 Божечки ты мой, я даже это позабыла. А это между прочим то, за что я полюбила Риодана.
Ну, что ещё сказать
Прощай ночь, здравствуй бессонница.
5816 2018-12-30 19:24:58 Can get info on truck yr ,miles, tire condition, use any oil.
5817 2018-12-30 19:24:55 All oil related?
5818 2018-12-30 19:24:54 We’ve always rubbed my son’s scalp and hair down with his baby lotion after bath to lock in that moisture! Never had a cradle cap episode in over 9 months! A small amount of baby oil rubbed into your hands then baby’s scalp helps a lot too.
5819 2018-12-30 19:24:49 Glad to see you have woken up after a long twitter nap. 1st) stating the truth is only seen as an insult if one does not like facts, we NEVER had a carbon tax as stated, Second oil prices are down all over the whole of NA due to a glut in oil, it has nothing to do with the PC's.
5820 2018-12-30 19:24:41 Germany has paid BILLIONS FOR THAT FUTURE AND ARE BUYING OIL FROM RUSSIA!
5821 2018-12-30 19:24:39 You just nailed it. Been growing in 2 completely different directions for awhile & no matter what we do to try to reconnect it’s like oil & water. At this point we’re only staying together for the kids which is making us both miserable.
5822 2018-12-30 19:24:35 But through all that, his crazy followers still believe the burden isn’t on him!  He claimed it before he did it but somehow he sold them snake oil and now it’s the Dems fault and they believe him. It’s wild!! #ImpeachHim
5823 2018-12-30 19:24:31 Wayne albums and his mixtapes are like oil and water. His mixtapes are free-flowing and simple. His album on the other hand, if he doesn't have nothing to talk about, its pretty bland.
5824 2018-12-30 19:24:22 You would prefer our nominee to be in the pocket of oil and gas companies? Isn't global warming a concern for you? Or are a denier like Trump.
5825 2018-12-30 19:24:13 Does not have one single positive character trait of a leader. 

Can we trade him to Russia for a couple of barrels of oil and a potential NBA player to be named later ?
5826 2018-12-30 19:24:07 Well there was that time during the 2015 campaign that a group of corporate oil titans publicly informed ABns that they would no longer donate to the Stollery Children’s hospital if ABns didn’t vote Conservative. So there’s that social generosity. Right?
5827 2018-12-30 19:24:06 This girl gave me peppermint oil last night let me tell you that shit put in workkk
5828 2018-12-30 19:23:54 I would say we pay a good part, but we also have our oil fund, that always gives us access to put extra money into school, public Healthcare, transportation, etc. Because our government when we found oil, desided to save money for future generations.
5829 2018-12-30 19:23:51 Nazis were a political party. Germany exists and thrives today. USSR? Net. Russia? They survive for now. Wow. Germany buys cheap gas from Russia. LOL Do you think RF has a monopoly on gas and oil? LOL RF sells cheap gas and oil and Germany exploits it. Germany's respected. Rf? No
5830 2018-12-30 19:23:49 How can our effect be big when the largest populations on earth will be burning oil without any regulation.
5831 2018-12-30 19:23:35 Our gov pulls out of environmental agreements, doesn’t believe in climate change, there are constant oil spills, drilling, & corporations have been dumping pollution for YEARS, but yes, blame poor ppl, esp poor ppl of color for only being able to eat what we can barely afford
5832 2018-12-30 19:23:32 Entertaining TED talk, but from 2006.  The world has changed significantly since, as has science and data.  Oil helped at that point... but is not a solution going forward.  Alberta needs to invest heavily in non-Oil energy, if they wish to remain relevant in decades to come.
5833 2018-12-30 19:23:28 This is so crazy!! It makes me glad I do whatever I can to avoid supporting the oil industry.
5834 2018-12-30 19:23:26 No breaking up big banks,  no affordable prescription drugs prices, no taking oil from Iraq, no war on the drug epidemic, no helping the addicts, to tax return, on trillions $$ infrastructure plan, no reformed VA ...we could go on and on it’s so bad smh
5835 2018-12-30 19:23:11 CeraVE moisturizer helps sooo much. And then add some palmers cocoa oil
5836 2018-12-30 19:22:59 Besides garbage, I wonder how much gas & oil ended up in the water. At least there’s video proof to help the reckless boating ticket they should have got hold up in court.
5837 2018-12-30 19:22:55 Wetlands are also the biggest natural recyclers of methane and CO2 in the world. The algae that grows in wetlands can be used to create extremely net positive biofuel/oil. Swamps benefit humans just as much as nonhuman animals so WHY IS A YOUTUBER DUMPING IN WETLANDS ANYWAYS?????
5838 2018-12-30 19:22:49 So it's the owner of Heyden Petroleum that's guber candidate for APC in Ogun... 
The oil boys are going into politics, considering same for Sahara Oil's Tonye Cole.
5839 2018-12-30 19:22:43 im frying these little cuts of pork and the oil was kinda spattering like hell so one of the slices jumped in the pan and i also jumped
5840 2018-12-30 19:22:29 Good trade for the Oil
5841 2018-12-30 19:22:17 just got anointed with oil 
5842 2018-12-30 19:22:09 Read that back in the 1960's marijuana had 2-3% THC~today the hash oil for vaping is 70-90% THC.....the difference between beer & pure grain alcohol.  These people are out of control and dangerous.
5843 2018-12-30 19:22:01 メイドインアビス界隈の「倫理観ゆるキャラ」とか「わくわくさんオルタ」とか「ダーク高田純次」とかそういうあだ名大好き……
5844 2018-12-30 19:21:51 Depressing sign of the times it’s baked beans and tinned milk really. I’ll be drying my own mushrooms, shooting my own game and making my own olive oil, thanks.
5845 2018-12-30 19:21:47 another day (night), another 12 hours spent workin for corporate Big Oil America!! let’s get it!!!
5846 2018-12-30 19:21:46 Абсолютно то же самое
А учитывая мелкие детали, которые так любит Риордан...

5850 2018-12-30 19:21:21 castor oil works the best, also cutting the ends every now and then helps keep ur hair healthy and fastens growth
5851 2018-12-30 19:21:20 Also using coconut oil for... reasons...
5852 2018-12-30 19:21:14 Nah some call for Tuna. Some call for fish oil. Not all of them use anchovies
5853 2018-12-30 19:21:11 A physical d that can’t move puck and handles it like a live grenade. Exactly what oil need
5854 2018-12-30 19:21:04 Ground turkey, onions, garlic, sweet potatoes, cream of chicken, olive oil and crushed red pepper in a skillet.  You are welcome.
5855 2018-12-30 19:21:04 Don’t even wanna go get my oil changed
5856 2018-12-30 19:21:04 No count the number of bubbles coming out from the frying oil

5859 2018-12-30 19:20:50 Plenty of easy guidance on the Internet of course.

One bit of wisdom.that is not.. From my Dad who was a Master Mariner and Navigator was to clean the scale only by rubbing it gently with the pad of your thumb. Natural oil once a day....
5860 2018-12-30 19:20:50 My husband’s in the oil and gas industry. He’s never spewed the kind of revolting anti-immigrant, Trumpian hate that’s on display here. It’s no excuse for this.
5861 2018-12-30 19:20:43 Hi Beckie. We do understand your concerns and source 100% of palm oil from suppliers who are members of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. We are also a relatively modest user of palm oil and substitute it with alternatives where appropriate. Kind regards, Jo.
5862 2018-12-30 19:20:33 Never do I feel like more of a failure than when trying to drive my car onto the ramp to get my oil changed. I would rather pay extra for them to do it for me 
5863 2018-12-30 19:20:09 We can stick to the healthier oils like olive oil and eat less of them. And eat oily wild fish.
5864 2018-12-30 19:20:08 Existing policy may be sufficient to kill the industry but an export tax would make sure. 

How do you feel about an import tax on foreign oil and gas?
5865 2018-12-30 19:20:07 OH MY DOD THAT LAVENDER OIL WAS AMAZING I SLEPT LIKE A FREAKIN BABY I WAS SO CALM
5866 2018-12-30 19:20:02 Energy doesn’t only come from oil.
5867 2018-12-30 19:19:59 I make few campaign promises, but I will come over to check your odometer and remind you to change your oil.
5868 2018-12-30 19:19:58 Wow, you just made my point. I know the definition of subsidy. Now sHow me a specific example of a Canadian oil and gas producer being subsidized.
5869 2018-12-30 19:19:55 In the Name of Jesus, I decree and declare that anyone struggling financially, as this oil comes upon you, God will change your story and wipe your tears.

Huhuhu
5873 2018-12-30 19:19:20 bringing out the oil pants :o looking forward to whatever creations you make with this beauty ^^
5874 2018-12-30 19:19:11 Absolute state of that Yellow Vest Ireland video doing the rounds on here. I’m not sharing it to give them oxygen but anything that snake oil salesman Gilroy is involved in is bound to be a farce full of cranks
5875 2018-12-30 19:19:09 They're uncontrollable, it's like they've just found oil. There's some progress though
5876 2018-12-30 19:19:04 This, if you're not allowed to ask questions about a topic. Then the topic in question is propaganda. I used to work at a DOE lab, good luck getting an experiment funded of you don't fall in line with the orthodoxy.
5877 2018-12-30 19:19:02 I need someone to wash my car for me & take it to get the oil changed
5878 2018-12-30 19:18:55 oh!イル

5882 2018-12-30 19:18:29 Please add red oil hahahahaha
5883 2018-12-30 19:18:25 Climate change is a farce.  Just another liberal Dem plot to tax and control Americans.  Won't work.  Energy dominance is on the way.  US is already #1 oil producer in the world .  LNG projects ready for Nat gas exports.  Fossil fuels will dominate at least thru 2050.
5884 2018-12-30 19:18:06 A Saudi fueled cottage in Muskoka? Does she even know where that is. Presumably not, given that there is no Saudi oil coming to Ontario or PQ for that matter
5885 2018-12-30 19:18:03 I use the bubble bath, soap and moisturiser together. But you may need something different with the tablets you're on. I had a skin condition in S.A. as I was allergic to the sun. I used olive oil. Simple and effective.
5886 2018-12-30 19:18:01 Have u tried castor oil?
5887 2018-12-30 19:17:59 Excuse me? 
Now you're calling me a white supremist because I support the oil and gas industry?
5888 2018-12-30 19:17:57 How long does it take to learn how to oil up?
5889 2018-12-30 19:17:51 Be eating oil soaked plantain and rice 
5890 2018-12-30 19:17:44 @BAP_Bangyongguk @BAP_Himchan @BAP_Daehyun @BAP_Youngjae @BAP_Jongup @ZELO96 Goodnight 
5891 2018-12-30 19:17:36 Volume now.  Always sellers, always new buyers.  New interest. Really quite inspiring history as many projects to tweak to production. Oil never distressed for long. Investors about to be v  opinions like assholes
5892 2018-12-30 19:17:29 Then crawl back from @DeleMomodu TL and go back to your stolen oil and gas from Niger Delta.
5893 2018-12-30 19:17:28 I will send this along to @Rick_Pescatore who maintains that the body never stores any chemicals or toxins because the liver and kidneys detox everything in real in real time. He thinks "stored metals" is a bunch of pseudoscience spouted by snake oil salesmen. Right Rick?
5894 2018-12-30 19:17:27 So most of you know that Nox has severe allergies. We have tried meds, shots and so many other things and nothing seem to be helping. But we tried these hemp oil treats & Noxhas stopped itching. So happy to have a healthy puppy! 
5895 2018-12-30 19:17:25 You conveniently forget that in 1973 the middle east oil cartel pushed up the price of oil that put the west into a recession which hit UK hard at the same time 'looney' left wing trade unions were decimating UK industry in the name of MARXISM and the USSR!!
5896 2018-12-30 19:17:15 And now they are enjoy his chaos and how he is dismantling government more and more, daily
See they sold off another huge swath of land last week in Utah so oil can be drilled

That is our nation's wealth being sold for private gain, at public cost -  pollution & destruction
5897 2018-12-30 19:17:10 And we won't have an incentive to come up with a "game changing amount of renewables" unless we cut back on our use of oil. The necessity of alternative means will breed those alternative means.
5898 2018-12-30 19:17:03 oil and water go together
5899 2018-12-30 19:16:54 No prob either add oil or put them in oil this how I cook everytime 
5900 2018-12-30 19:16:47 If nothing else in this Administration, we have learned to get back to the basics of Life..  Shovels (wall), Rakes(Fire), picks(mines) , cycle & hammer(Russia), Hoes & Snake Oil!!! 
5901 2018-12-30 19:16:44 My nose produces so much oil the US government has me on a list
5902 2018-12-30 19:16:43 Sen Bernie, I’m sure you would agree the biggest man made environmental disaster in history was WW2. Europe burned to the ground, 1000’s of oil laden ships sunk, nuclear weapons. Where is the damage? Only DIMMS think they’re more powerful than Mother Earth.
5903 2018-12-30 19:16:37 I’m about to learn how to change my own oil .... I’ve always wanted to ... just never took the time to learn

5907 2018-12-30 19:16:18 looking for venture capital to reinvent olive oil using achievements
5908 2018-12-30 19:16:15 Sarkari movie — takes me back to my childhood days every time I watch. Privates bus, narrating vacation stories after the school break, writing misbehaving student names on board, prayer (Pratane), rains, hair oil and powder, skits, drama and yakshagana.. Endless.
#nostalgia
5909 2018-12-30 19:16:05 This would not meet their employers mandate (LPC). Media bought and paid for.  Alberta has been working continually to reduce environmental impact of oil production. Haven’t seen any support from any of the Alberta NDP for Oil Industry. What’s up?
5910 2018-12-30 19:16:04 Give it a few months and some wild growth oil. We gettin the old tj back .
5911 2018-12-30 19:15:56 Peggy's such a loss to the Samaritans #thearchers
5912 2018-12-30 19:15:53 He's your problem now Oil country. Good luck, you just added a terrible defenceman. I'll enjoy watching Oilers fans tweeting about how bad he is in a week or so. I'm shocked he fetched a 3rd round pick AND a roster player. I would've been happy with a bag of pucks. Good riddance!

5915 2018-12-30 19:15:47 You’d think. Impossible. Dumb & Dumber. Throw out the math & numbers. I believe he knows not numbers. $$$$/immigration numbers/Oil numbers and the list goes on.  He is PM for 1 ONE  Province/CANADA. LOL.

5917 2018-12-30 19:15:40 For the longest time I used to think White Privilege  was a blessing to be born with..
Today Im reminded that isnt so.

Peeked through my Airbnb host's spice cabinet & its... tragic!

3types of salt, 1 pepper, 1 olive oil bottle & 4 'spices' -one of which hasnt been opened yet.
5918 2018-12-30 19:15:29 I was all ready to look into this palm oil problem and then I read that it’s in over 50% of all food items in the west as well as cleaning and beauty products. Why is doing good by the environment so freaking hard?! 
5919 2018-12-30 19:15:28 Even my old school republican father is like we need to get Big Oil and Big Pharama out of government. (He did not vote for dump) but he had to payout of pocket for my mom's first round of chemo, and his parents used to run a small farm with sheep and veg, and big agro -
5920 2018-12-30 19:15:27 Ok? But other countries will be using it longer than us. Let’s export and sell and make $$$$$. We can’t just create a game-changing amount of renewables out of thin air. We need oil money to expedite the process and become leaders.
5921 2018-12-30 19:15:18 We would put coconut oil in mt daughters hair and rub in with a brush, leave for 30 mins & then when we gave her a bath brush it out. We used a brush we got from the hospital that had like scrubs on the other side of the sponge. We did it like 3x for one week & then it was gone.
5922 2018-12-30 19:15:13 I was under the impression some of the oil was taken out by truck due to lack of pipelines for small producers. You believe the spread between Midland and WTI will increase? Wouldn't it decrease once the pipeline capacity is expanded?
5923 2018-12-30 19:15:10 Яро плюсую, только у меня один вопрос. Эта картинка аниме-версия мема я пидорас?
5924 2018-12-30 19:15:06 We go into the Middle East countries in order to get control of oil or we sell arms to countries which use them attacking their neighbours & we take no responsibility for destruction of civil life and erosion of safety. But we are happy that we’re not responsible for their lives.
5925 2018-12-30 19:15:02 Cooking naked and having the hot oil pop on ya titties
5926 2018-12-30 19:14:56 I have spent my whole 28 years of life and have never been to a game I been a fan since I was two, it would make my father's day to spend one night at the best place Lucas oil would love to support my Indianapolis colts I would like to be considered
5927 2018-12-30 19:14:51 But we no dey see the oil money
5928 2018-12-30 19:14:48 It's not just about global warming, it's also about the free market. Alberta oil is expensive and dirty, and the market is swimming with cheaper, better options.
5929 2018-12-30 19:14:48 In the Name of Jesus, I decree and declare that as this oil comes upon Your people, may everything around them turn around!

5931 2018-12-30 19:14:35 No. I didn't. And Neera was responding to the hit pieces by Bernie's army on Beto implying he took corporate or big dollar donations from the oil and gas industry. You need to get your facts and timeline straight.
5932 2018-12-30 19:14:33 I give CBD oil to my lil girl. she gets horrible storm anxiety and it’s helped her tremendously!! highly recommend!  EcoLife & Treatibles are two brands i’m familiar with that i’d recommend!
5933 2018-12-30 19:14:27 I am the PROUD owner of a CBD oil company!!! 
I absolutely love my products
5934 2018-12-30 19:14:18 - Eat healthier
- Don't touch your face 
- No popping spots / pimples
- Don't use oil based makeup
5935 2018-12-30 19:14:11 How do you clean an oil diffuser? I have never had one xD. The humidifier is a huge ordeal that can take 40 minutes or more with both apple cider vinegar and bleach xD
5936 2018-12-30 19:14:00 They don’t get palm oil from the palms of orangutans, they get it from these trees in the forest where the orangutans live. #shitbailliesays

5938 2018-12-30 19:13:44 YOU NEED OIL MONEY
TO ACTUALLY COMPETE
5939 2018-12-30 19:13:43 Wow, you’re leader is all about feelings, nothing else. Now you’re telling the oil industry the best option in your own liberal way? The industry knows what the best option is, not you or Trudeau. If Trudeau said EE was best, u would be on here stating that, not TMX. The industry
5940 2018-12-30 19:13:38 Comparing apples and street signs here: U.S. economy is farrrrrr different than Venezuela. For one, our economy is more free & mixed. For two, we aren’t relying on crude oil as a main export. Third, we have stronger political institutions overall.
5941 2018-12-30 19:13:36 Im bringing oil tycoon energy into 2019
5942 2018-12-30 19:13:26 I was wondering where my coconut oil went..
5943 2018-12-30 19:13:22 Thanks, Bernie. We knew 40 years ago the oil industry was selling doubt and dragging its feet. At 66, I've watched new generations of Unpaid Corporate Spokesparrots (or paid trolls)- "Truthcop", John B, WEAREMAGA- repeating company mantra with no due diligence.
5944 2018-12-30 19:13:22 Aku cakap alergic dengan bio oil orang tak percaya kenapa. Aku sorang ja ka tak boleh pakai benda tu kat muka 
5945 2018-12-30 19:13:19 The main protagonist in Stephen Fry's The Hippopotamus has a technique whereby he covers his still moist body with baby oil after bathing to facilitate ease of dressing.
Worth a try, whether you intend dressing or not.

Every time you deny climate science data in favor of oil/coal companies, you act as the entity gradually increasing the heat on the pot called Earth & your families are the frogs.

ALL of us are the frogs!
Doesn’t suicide permanently deny access to “heaven”?
5951 2018-12-30 19:12:56 ...is all that reliance on foreign capital actually an over-reliance (like NE Scotland and oil)? If the shit hits the fan and Google et al decide to up sticks there would seem (relatively speaking) far less to fall back on.
5952 2018-12-30 19:12:52 Donald and GOP so primitive in technology, their "wall" budget now includes catapults, archers and pouring hot oil over the wall onto climbing Latinos.
5953 2018-12-30 19:12:49 Neil is a great name for a a baby in #Thearchers
5954 2018-12-30 19:12:34 Hate when that happens.  Our coupons were the Oil of Olay type.  I replied about the CD, my memory not so good!
5955 2018-12-30 19:12:34 Oh wow ! Just look at that....brilliant.
5956 2018-12-30 19:12:27 yo honestly how dare my car always need gas. like i’m poor. AND i gotta do an oil change soon 
5957 2018-12-30 19:12:12 Oil City.....
5958 2018-12-30 19:12:05 Oil change, full tank of gas, car wash.... I’m dating my car.
5959 2018-12-30 19:12:00 Alberta should have done what either Finland or Norway did and heavily invested. People in Alberta complained about not charging oil companies enough for royalties. Again Alberta's stay out of our business, now come into our business attitude.
5960 2018-12-30 19:11:54 Even with all those hair oil you people use?
5961 2018-12-30 19:11:49 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
5962 2018-12-30 19:11:42 A drop or 2 of essential oil (whatever fragrance you're partial too) before deposit & after flushing should help with the......um.....offending olfactory assault.
5963 2018-12-30 19:11:41 Yo Skin Feel So Good After You Shave And Put On Coconut Oil
5964 2018-12-30 19:11:32 Dried Italian Sausage, Gruyere cheese, and cracked pepper and olive oil Tricuits. Football snack!
5965 2018-12-30 19:11:30 Happy new year madam!!! Kung buhay pa sunflower oil mo, bilhin ko pagbalik natin Maynila!
5966 2018-12-30 19:11:26 I wonder why? Word was that the state was going to see a huge influx of $$$ in the next decaden probably from oil, etc... so maybe dropped the rebates, etc?
5967 2018-12-30 19:11:19 "No one's done more for religion than I have." Besides the weakness of the statement, elements like faith in an invisible deity begs the question-What deity asked for his assistance? Like snake oil shills, DT stakes claims on slippery platforms he doesn't have to prove.
5968 2018-12-30 19:11:09 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
5969 2018-12-30 19:11:00 Envy=laugh? Innovation = lost in the 50s? Go it alone = no oil to tide? What grade did you drop out of?
5970 2018-12-30 19:10:38 The words "centrist" and "moderate" have somehow changed to mean that you are an ally of big pharma, big banks, big oil and Wall Street, .  Who knew that centrist and moderate voters were swayed by those things ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
5971 2018-12-30 19:10:23 Been bringing the noise since the early 90’s with the Hardhat and beating the pad in the RCA dome and Lucas Oil......plus my brother is already down there!!!!!

5973 2018-12-30 19:10:02 These rallies are not about any race of people. They are about how our economy is being undermined by foreign money. 
It's offensive that you continue to spread the lie that oil and gas industry supporters are members of a white supremist group.
5974 2018-12-30 19:09:53 Some Olive oil and garlic >>>
5975 2018-12-30 19:09:49 Get a bottle of oil as a point of contact, pray upon it and use it to anoint yourself and your family.

5979 2018-12-30 19:08:53 I have this belly/body scrub that I use in the shower that I got in my first trimester and holy cow it works so well I can’t take a shower without it. My belly has been so itchy and I feel like I’ve been doing really well not to itch it. Lotion and oil 
5980 2018-12-30 19:08:50 Wow Larry, I thought you were smarter than to buy into this snake oil crap.
5981 2018-12-30 19:08:48 That's absolute bullshit. Now @fordnation is taking credit for a drop in world wide oil prices. WOW what kind of stupid do you have to be to not only say but ACTUALLY BELIEVE this crap  #ONPoli #onpc
5982 2018-12-30 19:08:48 Pro oil protests in oil towns like Grande Prairie, Red Deer, and Estevan don't accomplish anything other than filling a daily news story. You want real results take it to Vancouver or Ottawa. The French didn't get results by protesting in Bordeaux, they set Paris on fire
5983 2018-12-30 19:08:47 I really couldn't tell you. The overall rate is 25%. It's the lowest in the country. I know that big oil has a penchant for hiring sub contractors that are non union.
5984 2018-12-30 19:08:46 US still wants Assad gone. They have never actively pursued it, but who knows, maybe they will. Russia did little but capture oil fields for profit and provide chemical weapons to Assad. Although, Russia did break an agreement that resulted in 200 dead soldiers. Those poor guys
5985 2018-12-30 19:08:45 Have you tried an air fryer without any oil.  Very juicy tender chicken.  Don’t have to attend to it while cooking.  Easy clean up.
5986 2018-12-30 19:08:35 Having a quiet day today , working on my oil painting , very different medium from yesterday’s mural . Enjoying the peace and watching my brother’s face emerge on the canvas. What do you all think ? Beth xx

5991 2018-12-30 19:08:15 Thanks for exposing #JerryBrown's actual record. He also collaborated with Trump on the #DeltaTunnels and exempting California oil fields from the Safe Drinking Water Act, in addition to making bad water deals with the Trump administration before leaving office. #CAWaterFix

5996 2018-12-30 19:07:46 Sir
Modi hd lot of options 2 force cong 2 take stand either vth sc/st or minorities. Instead modi is defensive, Mahatma vl loose 2019, modi won 2014 on his 2002 image.. Sadly he bought his own Gujarat model snake oil result is his core Hindu supporters r nt enthusiastic abt him.
5997 2018-12-30 19:07:38 Local apothecary or online.. I just diffuse the oil right now but when I run out, I’m trying the powder to burn.
5998 2018-12-30 19:07:32 My brother begged me for 3 days to give him the money to change my breaks and oil. It’s been 3 days and this bitch still ain’t touched my car

6000 2018-12-30 19:07:24 @ianmack0917816 - I’m sure you are a bot, but I’ll answer anyway. Postmedia is definitely conservative. I doubt they would promote anything Liberal! They definitely will promote oil though.
6001 2018-12-30 19:07:08 It's not but the anti oil activsts don't get paid to protest Saudi oil    and if they did they would probably end up in jail or killed, they know this, so the cowards protest Canadian oil.
6002 2018-12-30 19:07:07 According to my suegra, I'm my brother-in-law's "plug". Because I introduced him to CBD oil

6005 2018-12-30 19:05:43 My eyes are the source. My old colleagues who’ve closed their oil service/engineering companies are another source. The fact we have the 3 stooges Nenshi, Notley and Trudeau are the next source. Would you open a company in Canada right now? Don’t lie, how would you stay afloat?

6011 2018-12-30 19:05:18 Yeah I wasn't sure either. But I read he took money from oil & gas companies, so clearly he's not toeing the leftist line.
6012 2018-12-30 19:05:10 Coconut oil broke my face out bad. Everything is definitely not for everybody!
6013 2018-12-30 19:05:06 Why do you keep lying? 

A) Ontario never had a Carbon tax.

B) The low price of gas is due to the collapse in the price of oil and that winter gas is less costly to refine.
6014 2018-12-30 19:04:39 #thearchers it's all getting a bit meta
6015 2018-12-30 19:04:33 Moving back up. $TPL - no debt, 300 wells to be completed over next year or so. Royalty city ahead esp. if oil market settles down.
6016 2018-12-30 19:04:19 Yes. We are such hypocrites. If there’s something we want - oil, minerals, a tactical base - we’re all over it. Our colonial history is biting us on the bum and it’s entirely our own fault.
6017 2018-12-30 19:04:13 This is always the fall back position of the oil & gas crew. Having had to deal with an oil company drilling on our land found out pretty quickly how arrogant they are. First words out of their mouth are "You drive a car, you need gas". The reclamation was a joke.
6018 2018-12-30 19:04:00 Also what @fordnation fails 2 mention (or doesn’t know) is the glut of oil supply on the market lowering oil prices but I think he’s 2 dense 2 realize partially due 2 not showing up 2 work much just like when he was a Toronto city counsellor + he’s dense
6019 2018-12-30 19:03:56 12 years? 12 years left, hey? You must be a millennial. As a species we can’t survive without oil. Simply put, it’s in everything. It doesn’t have a 12 year expiration either.
6020 2018-12-30 19:03:49 LOL. I try.
I also try to do my part to reduce my carbon footprint so that we can start reducing the amount of fossil fuels that are burned and lessen my negative impact on the planet. Increasing he oil supply will only drive the price of oil down and reduce incentive for change
6021 2018-12-30 19:03:47  it smells good! It’s a purple oil.
6022 2018-12-30 19:03:34 WHEEZE you're probably right- curly hair is a curse sometimes for me because I hate oil residue on literally any part of my skin LMAO
6023 2018-12-30 19:03:32 The so called "Media" is not here to make the population informed, it is there to make their parent companies more money by pushing "their" narrative while charging the pharmaceutical, aerospace, and oil companies air time for their ads that tell us they are not guilty of crimes.

6032 2018-12-30 19:03:01 Yes CBD oil is amazing! And may help her a lot!
6033 2018-12-30 19:03:01 Thank you Jesus!!!!! Somebody found the cap to the blessed oil 
6034 2018-12-30 19:02:58 A 0-0 game, the people had got their money worth watching @whlref and I orchestrate a perfect game thus far. They needed a goal to see. Besides it is Saturday night I wanted to avoid OT, I had a tinder hook up to get to. Too bad the oil boys screwed that up.

6036 2018-12-30 19:02:47 There’s a pipeline support convoy rolling through our town.  Every hauling and oil service company in the area is on the highway, in spite of the snow.  Alberta and Canada flags are flying, horns are honking-& I’ve lost track of the number of trucks.
6037 2018-12-30 19:02:42 Your head get oil sir
6038 2018-12-30 19:02:41 We have been working at growing the economy; major developments in Mining, Oil & Gas, Technology, Aquaculture, Forestry and more are creating private sector jobs that will help support achieving a balanced budget. We continue to find efficiencies.

6041 2018-12-30 19:02:31 imagine if @GFuelEnergy made an @Crudes flavored drink and called it crude oil.
6042 2018-12-30 19:02:30 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.

6047 2018-12-30 19:01:56 Not sure how many expat Indian are there in Bandar Abbas now (in oil industry). But India has a consulate there.
6048 2018-12-30 19:01:55 Then get the oil diffuser cause I know you can get that cheap on amazon too
6049 2018-12-30 19:01:54 (Kicking ancreaming like a 3 year old)
I just want playooooooooooffs 
Watching cgy take a run while oil are golfing is gonna be soul crushing
6050 2018-12-30 19:01:46 Maybe you can stop bashing the oil now that he plays for us now lol
6051 2018-12-30 19:01:45 Yeah I had a CBD oil salesman pretty much do the same recently.
6052 2018-12-30 19:01:45 Oooh, I'll have to try this sometime.  I usually put butter and coconut oil in mine,  which also makes it very smooth, just not as sweet.
6053 2018-12-30 19:01:43 Brown approved >21,000 new permits 4 oil&gas drilling, refused to approve any limitations on #fracking or restrictions on fracking wastewater (eg lining storage pits), championed giveaway #CapAndTrade scam crafted by oil industry lobbyists, the list goes on: faux climate leader!
6054 2018-12-30 19:01:41 Then I should share that I quit driving (to protest oil empire) 10 yrs ago & now live in a community where I can walk where I need to go. So this is more like a neighborhood social activity -- to see my bros & chicas, like, time to play!
6055 2018-12-30 19:01:38 co-sponsored and voted for bills that killed regulations protecting borrowers, expand oil and natural gas exports, insulate corporations from liability, waived polygraphs for a corrupt organization (they are more accurate than guessing, even if they do provide false positives) 1/

6057 2018-12-30 19:01:31 I've seen a few good PC MP's repeat the nonsense that low pump prices are due to their cancellation of carbon pricing.  Assume they're under strong direction to follow this despite knowing its not true. World is full of cheap oil.
6058 2018-12-30 19:01:27 Big Oil hoping that by pandering the climate fraud crocodile will eat them last ..It wont because its a Marxist political gambit and not about the environment.#CarbonTaxStealing #AGWFraud #EnegyPoverty #cndpoli
6059 2018-12-30 19:01:23 Like the anti-DAP protestors aren’t acting in the favor of foreign oil interests... both sides have hired mercenaries. Big oil wins either way.
6060 2018-12-30 19:01:20 if you have good avo-spreading technique (i.e., with a butter knife, like butter, into all those gaps after a light toast then a drizzle of olive oil) it should be a non-issue. The holes then arguable enhance the experience
6061 2018-12-30 19:01:08 Your post just leads to people, especially young men, to spend money on useless test boosters and cortisol and estrogen suppressors. I have a dislike for fraudsters and snake oil salesmen. Do you believe that a 20% increase in test level matters if the level is within ‘normal’?
6062 2018-12-30 19:01:07 And how will you get Canada off of dependance of foreign oil? Whats your plan?
6063 2018-12-30 19:00:55 No, because the networks are slaves to oil and gas. If the networks were serious, they’d put this shit during the super bowl or final four.
6064 2018-12-30 19:00:52 Slowed? They have accelerated! Right now they have secured access for 40 years of cheap Cdn heavy oil as they race to develop and export their light shale oil. And to cap it off, the subversive anti pipeline lobby has us battling ourselves to secure their cheap supply.
6065 2018-12-30 19:00:48 Ofcus why won't you be one? Afterall there's oil in Biafraland for everyone..

6071 2018-12-30 19:00:18 Try the CBD oil, I heard it was good for you!   Good luck I’m sure reality will set in soon.
6072 2018-12-30 19:00:06 The only industry you reformists care about is the oil industry.

One example.

What did your party do when in power for the pulp and paper industry?

Maybe old harper should have come out of the closet and helped other industries and not just worry about oil all the time.
6073 2018-12-30 18:59:56 Without tea tree oil I would surely perish
6074 2018-12-30 18:59:53 That’s some good oil though I just hate when someone ask what do you have on. 
6075 2018-12-30 18:59:53 Despite so-called sanctions against Russia, the US and Europe continue to import crude oil and petroleum products.

In a complaint, NOREX alleges an improper takeover of TNK, which involved Alfa Group. Alfa Group is

6080 2018-12-30 18:59:40 The recent studies on NSAIDs side effects are scary. Let’s not forget how ototoxic Ibuprofen is as well. An Anti-inflammatory diet, yoga/stretching and supplements like fish oil / turmeric are a much better longterm approach to pain management.

6083 2018-12-30 18:59:13 I hope you realise that it’s your breadwinners you’re tweeting about.
The likes of @atiku @bukolasaraki @GEJonathan & others siphons all your hard earned oil money away & @APCUKingdom & supporters of @MBuhari earns foreign exchange & returns it to keep Nigeria afloat. #Getreal

6086 2018-12-30 18:59:02 White people that you hate aren't your neighbors or lawyers. They're the Rockefellers, Rothschilds, Bushes, and royals, they're the people who monopolize the water and oil & injected your communities with drugs til they spoil.

6093 2018-12-30 18:58:28 Yeah man, thank you. I have some family and friends now hooked on your show. I wish that I run on hot oil shirt ran bigger though.

6095 2018-12-30 18:58:07 Is there no Canadian news to cover.... why not interview an out of work Alberta oil worker? #cdnpoli
6096 2018-12-30 18:57:59 You mean February, as the only Manchester club we play in January is the one owned by all the oil money!
6097 2018-12-30 18:57:59 Of course it's got nothing to do with the price of oil?
6098 2018-12-30 18:57:58 To be fair, he's had a cancer scare and he thinks he's doing the right thing. I am more concerned with his drinking, smoking, sugar and vegetable oil intake!
6099 2018-12-30 18:57:56 Her menopause is going to kill us all. Can someone put her on a fish oil supplement already?
6100 2018-12-30 18:57:55 How do you propose we survive climate change if we don't stop increasing oil production and don't stop deforestation?
6101 2018-12-30 18:57:53 Nice open questions for them to burn all that brain oil :) How far are you through your total grading?
6102 2018-12-30 18:57:42 The "Bernie-left" arent the only ones that think Beto and Biden represent the status quo. It isnt good enough to just not be Trump. We want someone that can actually fix things. Dudes in the pockets of big oil wont do that.
Is that an "attack" on those candidates?

6109 2018-12-30 18:56:55 It isn’t a two-sided issue. There is peer reviewed science from around the world, and junk science from the oil industry. Big oil has  presented its lies long enough. The world isn’t flat; climate change is a real danger.

6115 2018-12-30 18:55:50 I wonder what she would cut first, university fees, prescriptions.That still would not cover the black hole not even by half, she would have to borrow more money to keep the charade up, the pound would continue drop in value and bankrupt our nation and if oil prices fell again.
6116 2018-12-30 18:55:44 anyone who suffers from really bad anxiety I highly suggest getting cbd oil it helps so much u drop 25-50mgs under your tongue 3-4 times a day. its a fucking miracle worker

6127 2018-12-30 18:54:17 And many went into Industries in Ontario including skilled trades and in Alberta to the oil patch which helped cut Job's real quick.

6128 2018-12-30 18:54:15 She thinks she’s badass
6129 2018-12-30 18:53:59 Did you just make that number up or is there a credible source for it.  I too think we need the oil industry but what we don’t need are CEOs who make 4-6 million a year.
6130 2018-12-30 18:53:57 just rubbed a shit ton of tee tree oil on my face, if i don’t wake up with clear skin i’m suing

6139 2018-12-30 18:53:03 It is not the Greens pushing for more international trade deals and more oil production. We all need to consume less and buy food and goods from closer to home.

6141 2018-12-30 18:52:56 Just learned that coconut oil cleans/polishes stainless steel. My appliances now look brand new... #cleaningtips #sundaymorning
6142 2018-12-30 18:52:38 It’s practically impossible to manage the minutiae like you are suggesting. The problem with the goldfish cracker and froot loop diet is that it lacks a good source of protein and probably a couple tbsp of olive oil or butter.

6146 2018-12-30 18:52:04 Still bothered by the poor lighting in the #ABCMurders as I was a youngster not long afterwards. Had a friend whose house was lit by oil lamps but that was exceptional and gas and then electric lighting had long superseded oil. And the viaduct. Was that in for artistic reasons ?
6147 2018-12-30 18:52:00 Well heck, if you listen to some of the horseshit people say about AB oil you’d think that rig hands were so busy saving orphans and planting trees that they hardly have time to extract oil.
6148 2018-12-30 18:51:58 Wow this is stunning acrylics or oil paint?

Who in their right mind would give up a slice of that very profitable cake?

6160 2018-12-30 18:50:51 True, we can not control the price of oil but our federal government has failed to support the main provincial resource. If oil was $80pbl Alberta would still have no viable way to get its resource to market. Build the pipelines AND work to diversify the economy for the future.
6161 2018-12-30 18:50:46 Shit ion wanna job rubbing oil on dick all day n I'm a fan
6162 2018-12-30 18:50:38 True that oil sands co.s have learned there is opportunity in taking action e.g. obsessive efficiency improvements. By consuming less fossil fuel in bitumen production, they have cut costs and boosted profits, even as they’ve shrunk the carbon footprint of each barrel of oil.
6163 2018-12-30 18:50:32 I'm thinking of giving up my career in oil exploration because it's just boring.

6166 2018-12-30 18:50:14 Wow. That is absolutely false. Most scientists agree climate change is real and man made. That includes NASA scientists and the Trump administration. Those who don’t agree are often funded by oil companies.
6167 2018-12-30 18:49:46 To I ran into the oil man n took it back n copped the Pussy oil n when I say I can't stop smelling myself lol
6168 2018-12-30 18:49:37 Oil gluts are a xmas miracle for cars.
6169 2018-12-30 18:49:28 Oil's not something we can rely on forever. What we should be doing is just what we are. Switching to something much more sustainable. Yeah, it'll be rocky at first. But if we don't change, the world will for us.
6170 2018-12-30 18:49:21 #SreesanthTheChampion now he will have to oil Maharanis hair to keep her happy!Poor chap.
6171 2018-12-30 18:49:07 People employed that have pension funds need to know how much of their funds are invested in OIL & Gas. 
Trust-fund Trudeau, Morneau & other elites will certainly have their $ safely invested while others are at risk.

6174 2018-12-30 18:49:02 You want that with Coconut oil Rich, it's great.  ^_^
6175 2018-12-30 18:48:41 I did Whole30 last year. It really works if you keep up this pace. I can send some kickass recipes that are compliant if you like. Plenty of solid options. Also, try baked homemade fries (hand cut from russet potato) with a homemade spicy mayo. Mayo homemade w/canola oil.
6176 2018-12-30 18:48:26 my top 30 albums of 2018 in no order but loosely by genre

6177 2018-12-30 18:48:21 I bought 3K oil with gems because I was out, got her on the second run of B1 after that :P
6178 2018-12-30 18:48:10 E go grow soon. No cream or oil. Just wait and see my brother. Be a better person in 2019. Siaman. My brother you are a blessing.
6179 2018-12-30 18:47:53 They don’t have the same donation pool too. Oil money basically got Jimbo to A&M
6180 2018-12-30 18:47:49 I’m really curious to hear @BetoORourke talk about his views on universal healthcare, and I’d like to know why he’s taken so much money from oil/gas industry. I really like him...
6181 2018-12-30 18:47:42 The Shame of Oil Lobbyes and Your Arrogance and Greed! #EndCoal #StopCO2onAir #ClearTheAir
6182 2018-12-30 18:47:41 methane doesn’t just come from the 15% of emissions from livestock. it also sources from fracking for oil and coal combustion.. something “the president” is strongly advocating for.
6183 2018-12-30 18:47:30 It originated in the peak oil economy and glamour culture of the 2000s, but now will more likely refer to such women sporting new iPhones because even the папики are kinda short on cash these days
6184 2018-12-30 18:47:22 The difference between this #ImpeachTrumpNow & Nixon

The Russian oil debt @GoldmanSachs & the @GOP have, has forced the end game. Rapturous self destruction. But the innovation to defeat this new Nazi is so overwhelming, We don’t need government to save  
6185 2018-12-30 18:47:22 This is why screen size goes up and up each year, because battery technology didn't advance much since the first commercial Li-Ion battery. And never will thanks to the oil industry. So, I rather have a 1.5cm thick phone than a phone with 10Ah battery that exyplodes due to an--
6186 2018-12-30 18:47:21 For sure and my tweet to you was actually with regards to your comment on Rod. When he felt the club was playing poorly, the listener would know exactly where he stood.
6187 2018-12-30 18:47:20 Chef Gusteau cut up some bars of soap, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a dictionary, along with Play-Doh.
6188 2018-12-30 18:47:19 Rudy, the price of gas fell due to the collapse of the price of oil, and that winter gas is less expensive to refine.

The cancelling of the Cap & Trade program only saved some 2-3 cents.
6189 2018-12-30 18:47:03 People of Basra and Iraq are not benefiting from the sale of oil. Most of the money is being looted by corrupt officials. People of Iraq should stop all oil exports
until their daily life start to improve.
6190 2018-12-30 18:47:00 When I speak about social welfare programs I admire in Norway, people will rebut: what about immigration? What about oil sales? My response is simple: I like political programs that I like, and dislike the political programs I do not like. This should not be terribly difficult.
6191 2018-12-30 18:46:56 Liberals should watch this.... biggest cover up for profit and oil ! — watching Shock and Awe
6192 2018-12-30 18:46:44 Those poor men and their poor families. They were just trying to make a decent wage. Instead the Tsar sent them to their death to get profit from oil. The international stage? Syria? LOL
6193 2018-12-30 18:46:43 Sources: Colts will raise the “2018/19 playoffs participant” banner at Lucas Oil tonight
6194 2018-12-30 18:46:41 Also, I find keeping my head/upper body slightly elevated helps.

Essential oil on the temples & neck. I recommend lavender or other relaxing scents.
6195 2018-12-30 18:46:28 Mueller wants to know where that $30m came from. Elvira should be getting an oil change on her broomstick in case she has to get out of town fast.@NRA
6196 2018-12-30 18:46:27 Medium means anong gamit mo for making art. Crayons, color pens, color pencils, oil pastels, acrylic, spray paint, charcoal, pencils are the examples of medium :)
6197 2018-12-30 18:46:25 Really looking forward to the City Liverpool game, hopefully Salah will dive his way to 5 penalties while City are denied 6 nailed on ones, then the FA might finally do something once Pep and the oil money start moaning
6198 2018-12-30 18:46:22 @jordanbpeterson When will Jordan Peterson be found out to be the sad little fraud that he is?  He is completely disregarded by his peers, he hides from anyone who could destroy him in a debate with truth & facts, he is a cult leader selling snake oil to desperate, confused ppl

6200 2018-12-30 18:46:14 Make a paste with hot water and sea salt and a drop of tea tree oil apply it with a hot wet q tip and leave it overnight for several days
6201 2018-12-30 18:45:56 This is gonna be a dumbass question for a stoner... but wtf do you do with oil? Lmao dabbing uses wax , I’m confused now. Also high already 
6202 2018-12-30 18:45:53 My favorite part about fish oil is the fish burps
6203 2018-12-30 18:45:45 Na oil MONEY be the next target. 
You see wetin dey happen fr anambra this December?
6204 2018-12-30 18:45:44 I use Somerville soap works all olive oil Castile soaps and also their beard oils.
6205 2018-12-30 18:45:41 Does 30,000 oil leaks since 1975 in Alberta alone, constitute #1 sustainability and environmental protection? #askingforafriend
6206 2018-12-30 18:45:40 That's hilarious Pete, can only imagine, the Bentley and your Maxi pissin oil, bet you felt as welcome as a fart in a space suit  
6207 2018-12-30 18:45:37 When you book a massage for morning and realise you don’t have any massage oil at home 
6208 2018-12-30 18:45:35 たまちゃんの音色でおっとりしたい_(┐「ε:)_
6209 2018-12-30 18:45:30 Errr.. you have a very short memory.. have you forgotten WE, yes Britain have made countries like Iraq, Afghanistan and Lybia living hell for their people after we raped their oil and gas and left them in a very unstable situation? Still living in the days of Empire #idiots
6210 2018-12-30 18:45:27 Lol I see somebody oil was leakin this morning 
6211 2018-12-30 18:45:24 Sorry not on insta however my 2 cents Google “food photography” and study framing of the pics you like.  I’d say yours are too close.  Don’t think the food you photograph has to be edible.  Brush food with oil to get it to glisten.  Etc. Use more/finer garnish.  Avoid beige food.
6212 2018-12-30 18:45:19 @BetoORourke I’m really interested in you as a candidate, but I need to know more. Specifically, I need to know if you’re for universal healthcare, and I need to understand why you’ve taken so much money from oil/gas industry. Important issues to us real progressives.
6213 2018-12-30 18:45:12 Yessss when the water hot & steamy with some lavender oil girlll
6214 2018-12-30 18:45:05 Yes when I turned down his advances he latched on to Snake Oil Phil. To spite me.
6215 2018-12-30 18:45:04 What oil do you have in it?
6216 2018-12-30 18:45:03 so ummm!!!! i’m excited to announce that in january i’m gonna start to make essential oil chakra crystal candles!!!!! 
6217 2018-12-30 18:44:57 Extra virgin olive oil=grayson
6218 2018-12-30 18:44:55 一応そん感じ！だけどこれSdカード挿してそこに保存できるらしかったの！だけど無理でした
6219 2018-12-30 18:44:55 People employed in Canada would be well advised to find out if their employer is involved in any way in the Oil&Gas industry.   While they are it find out how much of their pension funds are invested there.  
They may then realize the importance of it.
6220 2018-12-30 18:44:53 there are Boards of Directors and Shareholders who have watched world oil prices drop and continued with the ship it to the USA paradigm while margins shrank ... now all of a sudden it is the fault of the Government ?   too funny
6221 2018-12-30 18:44:42 I know Alberta is losing its shit right now but patience my western counterparts. Oil will not be this low for long. Just like VIX, Unemployment rate, & Financial Stress Indexes: all these have been low for far too long. History demonstrates these will skyrocket ...
6222 2018-12-30 18:44:33 It was a joke I don’t rub baby oil on my canister 
6223 2018-12-30 18:44:27 Sage & Blessed Oil
6224 2018-12-30 18:44:23 My son bought a car from @TheRAC_UK franchised garage (FABRICATED service history )
The car had no services between 2012 & 2018 
NO SAFETY CHECKS
TYRES
BRAKES
STEERING
NO OIL CHANGES FOR 6 YEARS
BUT
THE RAC SUPPORT THEIR DEALER AND WILL NOT SANCTION THE DEALER OR REFUND MY SON..
6225 2018-12-30 18:44:21 Write their license plate down on a piece of sheep skin bathed in oil for 72 hours and leave it out in your closest storm drain and I will send them to a bad dimension
6226 2018-12-30 18:44:18 Aww nawww. have you tried tea tree oil?  It worked wonders for mine
6227 2018-12-30 18:44:09 sorry - but if you think oil losing 4 games has twitter raging - suggestion of trading star player would require EPS on DEF CON 10
6228 2018-12-30 18:43:59 so thats sake? ive been seeing these memes thinking it was fuckin oil these guys were squiriting at ya

6231 2018-12-30 18:43:24 I guess this also makes me enslaved to the middle east oil if I like driving.
6232 2018-12-30 18:43:24 I haven't had broccoli rabe since I left Jersey and found some at the local grocery store. Sauteed that shit up with a little butter, olive oil, and garlic and now I'm 14 again
6233 2018-12-30 18:43:20 right! have you ever tried the oil 
6234 2018-12-30 18:43:16 Maybe the guy's just a lying snake oil salesman
6235 2018-12-30 18:43:10 America free trades our oil at 11 and resells for 56.
6236 2018-12-30 18:43:01 참 아이러니해
6237 2018-12-30 18:42:59 Weaning is hard! Went to buy @cowandgate porridge for little one and they use palm oil! Not buying that then!! #palmoil #savetheplanet #nopalmoil #savetherangtan #palmoilfreebaby #theyareourfuture #palmoilfreefamily #ourplanetmatters #rangtanlivesmatter
6238 2018-12-30 18:42:56 OIL dey your HEAD brother
6239 2018-12-30 18:42:53 Much easier way to transport bitumen, instead of thinning it enough to be pumped in pipelines. Lac Mégantic wouldn't have turned into an inferno, if the train would have been carrying CanaPux instead of crude oil.
6240 2018-12-30 18:42:51 Great reply. I love watching pro oil squirm. 
6241 2018-12-30 18:42:46 I have Curl La La. it’s so trash sis, it dries up the hair. The Cantu coconut curl cream is a little better, that + argan oil and a bomb conditioner
6242 2018-12-30 18:42:37 The oil just floats to the top and does nothing while boiling. Also, the oil keeps the sauce from sticking to the noodles.
6243 2018-12-30 18:42:35 하고 싶은 맘이 들꺼면 낮에나 들것이지
6244 2018-12-30 18:42:30 Anointing oil...
6245 2018-12-30 18:42:27 I blowdry my hair after I wash it, I might do a light flat iron depending on the look. But, after all that I put my twist in. I oil my scalp every other day and put Shea butter on my twist everyday for 2 months.

Plus! I can just slap a wig on cause the twist are small.
6246 2018-12-30 18:42:24 Olive oil kelewele and cashew nuts is quite the alté mix I didn't know I necessarily needed.
6247 2018-12-30 18:42:15 새벽엔 관종짓 해봤자 아무도 없다굿
6248 2018-12-30 18:42:06 Here in Alberta, the economy is awful not because of the federal or provincial government. It's awful because of the global stage and the unstable price of oil. That's what we get when we base our whole economy on one unsustainable resource.
6249 2018-12-30 18:42:04 A bit on body tea tree oil..it stinks...smells horribly but works well
6250 2018-12-30 18:42:03 Urgh, feel your pain, migraines are debilitating. I find taking pain killers as soon as the pain goes past ‘headache’,putting peppermint oil on my temples, staying away from cheese, processsd pork & alcohol, & a nice dark room can improve things. Hope this is a one-off bad one 
6251 2018-12-30 18:42:01 Gueas its time to use your powers as leader and GET OUR OIL TO MARKET
6252 2018-12-30 18:41:58 아 새벽만 되면 관종이 되는데 어째서지
6253 2018-12-30 18:41:17 Kenney’s big plan is to call all the oil & gas CEOs into a room and tell them to “get in the game”. Jason Kenney and the UCP don’t even know what the game is. Alberta and Canada needs transformational leadership. #ucp are living in last century. #cdnpoli #abpoli
6254 2018-12-30 18:41:13 @HungryTrucker @jojoflapjack79 @jojoflap @OilfieldHAF @Lumberist @smithdonald2013 Great Video! Exposing the #DarkMoney behind all the anti Alberta Oil sentiment is something not well publicized and is the root cause of all the propaganda out there. Keep up the good work!
6255 2018-12-30 18:41:12 Omg wake up he is a snake oil sales man
6256 2018-12-30 18:41:07 ...unless of course you consider a heavy sheen of olive oil clothed. The lads went through a couple amphorae (about 10 liters each) over the five-day festival.
6257 2018-12-30 18:41:04 “Science is not static” is your excuse for doing nothing and continuing to rake in those big oil and gas bucks, correct?
6258 2018-12-30 18:41:00 えっえっ、うれしい。次回できるようにがんばる！
6259 2018-12-30 18:40:42 That knee all oil and greased up!! The depth on the catch is impeccable!!
6260 2018-12-30 18:40:37 It's socialism and capitalism too. Important thing to learn is only hard work pay off. Don't depend on oil
6261 2018-12-30 18:40:35 That's absolute bullshit. Now @fordnation is taking credit for a drop in world wide oil prices. WOW what kind of stupid do you have to be to not only say but ACTUALLY BELIEVE this crap  #ONPoli #onpc

6266 2018-12-30 18:40:08 Typical climate denier nonsense. You are  among the 1% & only looking out for your oil investments. You don’t care about the greater good & this serious threat to society. You care only in protecting your own riches. - #climatechange #sciencematters
6267 2018-12-30 18:40:07 Anointing by definition means to be smeared with oil. It symbolizes authority. What has God empowered you to do? #FBCGLive @KeithBattle

6269 2018-12-30 18:40:02 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
6270 2018-12-30 18:40:02 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
6271 2018-12-30 18:39:43 So true! Teach them vehicle maintenance before they can drive. Mine won't be allowed behind the wheel if they can't change oil and a tire. One year away from learner's permit and they already have the beginning basics down.
6272 2018-12-30 18:39:34 Come on now; oil prices have tanked. Gas prices should follow, right? And what is Doug going to do about climate change, just let the Little People (and everyone else) stew in the heat? Low gas prices make sense only if you want to give up on Civilization.

6274 2018-12-30 18:39:30 All of the proposals by scientists won't even reduce sea-level rise by 1 mm over the next 100 years. It's all just feel-good measures that won't have any impact. You're selling snake oil, old man.
6275 2018-12-30 18:39:27 HEY!!!! I love canned sardines in mustard and so does your great grandma… And your late great grandpa loved them too!  The only ones we never ate were the one soaked in oil
6276 2018-12-30 18:39:18 This is far too little and much too late.  Oil & gas companies have done huge damage to this planet while doing everything possible to delay action on climate change.

They should all be sued into oblivion.

6278 2018-12-30 18:39:15 I can't remember who said it but I always go to this quote when any discussion of oil use occurs.

"You broke my legs and then got mad at me for using crutches."
6279 2018-12-30 18:39:15 Post media is trash commentary. Corrupted by oil companies out west and too short staffed to actually provide a real service to citizens.
6280 2018-12-30 18:39:06 Please give me specific examples of death and destruction and refer me to your source.  I already know about oil spills so leave that out.
6281 2018-12-30 18:39:06 cont'd FT deals with all countries and the fact a large % of present Xborder trade is unlikely to change given the make up of this trade and we shall be able to negotiate our own CFP and Oil/Gas rev's I do not see this is an issue. We are all going to suffer from England's dec.
6282 2018-12-30 18:39:05 What does this gen want??

It just refuse to start 
6283 2018-12-30 18:39:05 This is true for most processed butter. High Vitamin Butter Oil does not need the same kind of refrigeration.

6291 2018-12-30 18:38:20 Weird. Alberta has a carbon tax and our gas prices are still lower. Maybe it has something to do with the price of oil?
6292 2018-12-30 18:38:18 How about helping a novice oil trader? Need advice!
6293 2018-12-30 18:38:12 I stopped at the market once fresh off the beach. Baseball hat, shorts, and T-shirt, flip flops and I’m pretty sure I still had sand on me, stuck to the oil. Over the produce I hear my maiden name called by a male voice lol Never ever fails to happen

6296 2018-12-30 18:37:55 Low gas prices are due to the collapse of the price of oil, and will get gas which is cheaper to make.

So far Doug has spurned investment, not encouraged it.
6297 2018-12-30 18:37:52 My plug be sending me such exotic looking oil and bud and I just wanna cop it all. FUCK
6298 2018-12-30 18:37:51 Yup same. Like 5 minutes you got oil. So fridge it stays.
6299 2018-12-30 18:37:50 Amin  ya Rabbi
6300 2018-12-30 18:37:42 In Saskatchewan and Manitoba there are abandoned oil wells that are affecting the ground water. The taxes could clean up those wells.
6301 2018-12-30 18:37:35 Attacks. If pointing out piss poor legislation, exposing candidates who are backed by big oil, the MIC, and big banks, and utter hypocrisy is "attacks", I can assure you that you are in for a bad time over the next two years.
6302 2018-12-30 18:37:23 Tea tree oil...ginkoba...co q10 take these...tea tree oil a but on body or body parts to heal.... homeopathic remedys
6303 2018-12-30 18:37:15 When TX is a dust bowel and to hot to live in you will find Climate Change is real and we can solve the problem but your Stupidity and being bought by big oil and religious beliefs will kill millions. The good news is the majority is going to stop your party belivers stupidity
6304 2018-12-30 18:37:10 Went for an oil change. Ended with every mechanic in the shop standing around my car talking about how many problems there are. Need new car.
6305 2018-12-30 18:37:08 Not even close, @BetoORourke has very questionable voting record & proved himself to be just another corporate dem, masquerading as a progressive to win the primary, then pivoting to wishy washiness & to the right
Only @tedcruz received more $ from oil in Congress's 535 members
6306 2018-12-30 18:37:06 Post partition Muslims struggled and oil economy gave every Indian includingHindus support to rise from abject povertyEducated lot misguided

6308 2018-12-30 18:36:59 If Oil from the Earth was supposed to be used the way we use it how come Earth didn’t come with cars?
6309 2018-12-30 18:36:59 Fully aware of The Project for New American Century. And the letter they wrote to Clinton calling for overthrow of Saddam. We chose to acknowledge the pre-meditated nature of the invasion of Iraq through the energy commission and the maps of Iraqi oil fields...
6310 2018-12-30 18:36:32 Cannabis oil ?
6311 2018-12-30 18:36:32 if any of those idiots were smart, they would put their money in cannabis stock, like the bastards did in Canada and make silly money on account of it being legal. Time just overran those guys and their oil based stock options, let's see how long does it take for them to find out
6312 2018-12-30 18:36:27 No more military..gonna follow my brothers footsteps and gonna work in the oil rigs love you big bro 
6313 2018-12-30 18:36:24 Why does the NDPs continue to blame the oil industry for climate change? That's pretty narrow minded of someone who has best Interests of the environment!

6317 2018-12-30 18:35:59 People always have hidden agendas until it comes to light. But don’t be hard on him; Oil and gas is in every household, clothing, accessories and so much more.
6318 2018-12-30 18:35:58 A few years ago, I saw this guy driving a beater flatbed in Calgary with placards that said: Hands off our oil! Hands off our guns! Hands off our tax dollers! (Yes, he’d misspelled dollar.) That’s your typical separatist here.
6319 2018-12-30 18:35:57 I remember the day I posted Ukodo with plantain and palm oil on my TL and someone said it looks like sacrifice. A whole food of my ancestors, this platform is annoying 
6320 2018-12-30 18:35:49 Then we should support responsible and ethical production of such resources rather than jurisdictions who produce oil at any cost.
6321 2018-12-30 18:35:49 we'll bring the squirrel oil
6322 2018-12-30 18:35:47 Red oil
6323 2018-12-30 18:35:39 It's nothing less than a World War level effort, the greatest challenge humankind has ever faced. We have the tech & resources to avoid the worst scenarios, but we need politicians in power who mean it to take on big oil and rid the economy of fossil fuels.

6324 2018-12-30 18:35:39 Did you know Trump sold off 15% of the strategic oil reserve to lower the deficit that arose from the tax cuts?  When oil prices were low?  So it would look like another trillion dollars hadn’t been added to the deficit?
6325 2018-12-30 18:35:38 There would be better access to markets if Conservatives didn't destroy the reputation of Canadian oil.
6326 2018-12-30 18:35:37 This isn’t just cosmology either they like to prey upon poor kids who think they’ll be able to get a decent job with their worthless degree, they’re basically snake oil salesmen
6327 2018-12-30 18:35:32 Given that prime offenders listed were China, Ukraine and Qatar then these are probably State Owned Oil  so it's not exactly profit.

How do we deal with State Owned Oil?  It's a much bigger problem than Exxon and can't be addressed through investor action.

6328 2018-12-30 18:35:32 Norway is a free market economy with many social welfare programs largely funded my a government sponsored oil company. Venezuela is a socialist dictatorship with government deciding everything about the economy. The same government stole its oil from private owners.
6329 2018-12-30 18:35:30 its really easy.  i take 1000 iu of D3 a day, 2100 of b12 a week, and 2x 300 algae based sea oil pills a day.

its easy eating at home anyways, eating at restaraunts is another story.
6330 2018-12-30 18:35:30 + That not only is NDA winning comfortably, Modi is going to be able to do it without having to offer huge freebies which will seriously damage the fisc. Not denying that oil prices major driver of yield) but if markets expect, say, a 3 trillion giveaway by modi, or worse, UPA +
6331 2018-12-30 18:35:24 *Eddie finishes drinking the oil and throws it to Richie* Mazzola!
6332 2018-12-30 18:35:21 Will that is extremely disturbing
6333 2018-12-30 18:35:19 I just dropped “Two thousand Alignteen” on the guy selling cbd oil across the street at the farmers market and I think it’s going to be their marketing campaign for the year. All I want is my fair share.
6334 2018-12-30 18:35:15 De-clawing the CFPB, weakening protections for mortgage borrowers, lifting the ban on oil exports, allowing drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, ending the Volcker Rule & other Wall Street deregulations, and the second (less known) Trump tax bill.  All of those, Beto voted for.
6335 2018-12-30 18:35:15 I did, I did. I had to put a tray under the sump to catch the oil. Parked next to a Bentley one time, the owner flogging and cussing the river, the keeper, and the fish. Think Basil with a fly rod!
6336 2018-12-30 18:35:06 じゃあちゃんと起こしたから寝るね
6337 2018-12-30 18:35:06 The Fed creating TRILLIONS in conjured money did nothing but benefit the banks & the speculators of the world. Once the price of oil is done being artificially suppressed inflation will sky rocket. 

2019 - 2021 (& perhaps longer) will be tough times for THE PEOPLE.
6338 2018-12-30 18:35:04 Damn my oil diffuser fell and broke. That's not pleasant
6339 2018-12-30 18:35:01 there's an oil used in skincare called "Jojoba oil" but I can only think of it as "JJBA oil"
6340 2018-12-30 18:34:58 Was very happy to hear the paper being delivered this AM. I know someone was burning midnight oil to fix the issues.
6341 2018-12-30 18:34:56 the snake oil salesman will make everything better!

6348 2018-12-30 18:34:04 #My2019HealthResolution is to have more of home cooked meals than food bought from outside. Will cook food in healthy oil & make  smart choices for food. Will have roasted popcorn or behl instead of samosas, fruit juices instead of fizzy drinks .
6349 2018-12-30 18:34:01 Which oil did you use?
6350 2018-12-30 18:34:00 334
6351 2018-12-30 18:33:59 Combination! Murad nutrient water gel, herbivore emerald oil plus sunscreen.
6352 2018-12-30 18:33:54 No it absorbs too much oil
6353 2018-12-30 18:33:49 You're typically hilarious.
Irving Oil is the only refinery to import Saudi Oil.
I don't think trudeau owns shares,
but ok
6354 2018-12-30 18:33:46 Waiting for an oil change at Jiffy Lube is such a mood.
6355 2018-12-30 18:33:42 @CHAZDEAN what was the name of the oil you spoke of with vitamin K when you were with @JLJeffLewis ??
6356 2018-12-30 18:33:41 The holiday oil RETURNS
6357 2018-12-30 18:33:36 What’s the problem? Service people are being honored for their service: to keep the oil supply open. :0(
6358 2018-12-30 18:33:20 An article about tarsands’ fate without mentioning the price of oil (lower than tarsands oil breakeven price and likely to remain so thanks to fracking) is am exercise in journalistic malpractice. For these reporters’ sake, I hope an isolated incident
6359 2018-12-30 18:33:19 if I were in Oil and Gas I would be looking to pick up oil assets from Petrobras. State-run enterprise is the biggest dumbest money out there.
6360 2018-12-30 18:33:15 Prayer warrior for Dog bounty hunters wife...healing  for health concerns...have evoo or church oil on her body using your own bottle of H20 placed on her body head to toe or have preacher do it...

6363 2018-12-30 18:32:27 Mom got a job with a marijuana oil company so I guess you could say she’s living out her dreams
6364 2018-12-30 18:32:21 Most of copies are available to your near Pakooray and samosay wala and the good thing about the book is the quality of pages is very good they sucks oil properly from pakroas and samosas 
6365 2018-12-30 18:32:21 A very good lotion:
Coconut oil (350g), olive oil (300g), Shea butter (75g), beeswax (100-200g depending on quality and desired consistency). Combine in double boiler, transfer to class containers once melted and mixed, let cool. Herbs, oils, etc can also be added.
6366 2018-12-30 18:32:17 "Hey kids, who wants some nice healthy oil!?"
6367 2018-12-30 18:32:15 Like most people who advocate for expanding oil and gas, they would prefer the results of their actions be felt by others.
6368 2018-12-30 18:32:12 I don’t think teriyaki will help me get past the whipped raw eggs and oil.

6370 2018-12-30 18:31:38 Hey, I have a great idea. Maybe we could sell our oil & gas to this area, rather than just our coal. What do you say Jim?
6371 2018-12-30 18:31:31 “Are any among you sick? They should call for the elders of the church and have them pray over them, anointing them with oil in the name of the Lord” (James 5:14).
“I am writing to you, my dear children, because your sins have been forgiven because of Jesus” (1 John 2:12).
6372 2018-12-30 18:31:28 Lol same. I get nervous with certain foods. But I mean I guess I can braise them take it off the bone for a noodle dish, or marinate in fish oil before frying for a general tso -esq dish or use it for a pan fried dumpling.
6373 2018-12-30 18:31:26 The difference between this #ImpeachTrumpNow & Nixon

The Russian oil debt @GoldmanSachs & the @GOP have, has forced the end game. Rapturous self destruction. But the innovation to defeat this new Nazi is so overwhelming, We don’t need government to save  
6374 2018-12-30 18:31:23 Let’s talk about a threat to national security:  Did you know Trump sold off 15% of the strategic oil reserve to lower the deficit that arose from the tax cuts?  When oil prices were low?  So it would look like another trillion dollars hadn’t been added to the deficit?
6375 2018-12-30 18:31:20 You must be referring to those well respected scientists employed by oil companies
6376 2018-12-30 18:31:19 Fracking was an attempt to make the US less dependent on foreign oil.  Now considered interim measure due to the impact on underground water.  Nevada just passed a referendum to commit to 50% renewables ASAP
6377 2018-12-30 18:31:15 What ever happened to "oh lord bring back the oil industry! I promise I won't piss it away again" seems like some of you did?

6380 2018-12-30 18:31:02 What deepika is trying to say is absolutely right. Oil should be applied on the roots for good hair only applying oil on the tips will never give good result.
6381 2018-12-30 18:31:01 I had one like that, just kept applying tea tree oil
6382 2018-12-30 18:30:57 And yet they scream about “nazis” everywhere
6383 2018-12-30 18:30:42 ring me when Vanity Fair does a profile on climate change activists who are facing lifetimes in jail for protesting oil pipelines as "terrorists" or for women who outed their rapists on bathroom stall walls. not this "woe is young white female Trump supporters" horseshit
6384 2018-12-30 18:30:40 He didn't make a video when women were sending him things. He's a Tyler Perry Baby Oil actor so I know the daughters of Zion were offering to let him hear their personal mac and cheese sauce.
6385 2018-12-30 18:30:35 These blocks will require trains for transportation. How much more oil traffic can the railways handle safely before they restrict agricultural shipments.  Build the pipelines.

6389 2018-12-30 18:30:03 Snake Oil Masters like Franklin Graham contribute mightily to the decline of christianity. He does promote hate speech, actually, maybe just not on FB. Of course Rev. Holier-Than-Thou immediately leaps to his persecution complex.
6390 2018-12-30 18:30:01 A huge amount of money has been set aside for the oil industry to use to reduce their outputs, but there are few strings. Our governments seem incapable of not giving the oil industry everything it wants. And we can't do that and address climate change. It's that simple.
6391 2018-12-30 18:29:58 The wars themselves are to perpetuate the petrodollar system. See Saddam, Gaddafi and recent tension w/ Saudi. Pricing oil in $ ensures exorbitant privilege and DC / deep state dominance
6392 2018-12-30 18:29:47 So now they WANT the oil, but don't want US to get any. 

Understood. Typical.
6393 2018-12-30 18:29:36 I’m torn between maybe some clothes or like an oil diffuser and Himalayan salt lamp
6394 2018-12-30 18:29:33 lol at a wrestler calling someone else gay... they literally have a move called "checking oil" which involves thumbs up asses.
6395 2018-12-30 18:29:21 Anything orthodox does not belong where these idiots come from
They blame Islam while your government foreign policies created the terrorists so they can unveil their messiah while taking oil
Bunch of morons these ppl are
6396 2018-12-30 18:29:16 .@FoxNews #FakeNews U report market worst ever-really?? at 23,000 So that's false! U haven't mentioned margin calls when oil dropped $75 to $45/barrel that brings margin calls which means Selloff for cash to pay margin calls! .@AmericaNewroomHQ
6397 2018-12-30 18:29:05 Nice try Vic but you're not that good. But just in case can you telepathically move oil over the Rockies.
6398 2018-12-30 18:28:58 Si es inmediato, no me refería a eso. Me refería al impacto en los indicadores económicos a futuro, también toca esperar que dice la FED en enero. Generalmente los ajustes económicos se dan el siguiente mes dependiendo de los indicadores del mes anterior y el precio del OIL.
6399 2018-12-30 18:28:48 I just gave my kitten CBD oil to calm her anxiety about going to the groomers. This is the kind of pet owner I’ve become.

6402 2018-12-30 18:28:16 the shutdown will happen when the oil (money) runs out. then .. anarchy. just a matter of time.
6403 2018-12-30 18:27:58 I mean in the hy results a price of $67.5 pb was realised. You wont get that now. How much will the lower oil price hit the bottom line?
6404 2018-12-30 18:27:36 oil stab ya m8

6407 2018-12-30 18:27:16 They could have forced the industry to adopt old wells for clean up as part of any expansion. Acted to deal with the money owed to landowners by delinquent oil companies. 

But they haven't. The industry isn't paying anything more, and they're being showered with subsidies.

6411 2018-12-30 18:27:03 When things are not going well, global glut on oil for example, the need to have someone to blame is a strong human trait ie to personalize it. It can be ugly and not constructive. #cdnpoli @RosieBarton
6412 2018-12-30 18:27:03 Overpaying the non-educated what did we expect of them now that the oil boom is over and they realize that they will never again make 200.000 a year for labor work

6421 2018-12-30 18:25:56 Malgastar lo que teníamos es poner la nafta a u$1.20 aunque el oil baje de u$80 a u$45 ? si los precios internacionales corren para la luz también debe ser para el petróleo Y gas  no te parece?
6422 2018-12-30 18:25:55 I’m so damn tired, I just poured myself a glass of olive oil, thinking it was orange juice 
6423 2018-12-30 18:25:54 I want a representative who does not vote to deregulate oil & chemical industries, a representative who makes the CFPD stronger, not weaker & ineffective, a representative who does not agree with more oil exploration in our gulf, in our artic, in our national lands 
You?
6424 2018-12-30 18:25:53 Just popped two midols, put on a peppermint oil sheet mask and tucked into bed with my heating pad
6425 2018-12-30 18:25:23 Good article! Still shows higher CO emissions with electric but balances out over time. Nuclear is still the cleanest source outside of solor or wind and far more developed. That said, I'm all for transitioning away from oil. Be hard to let go of my Expedition! Swap powertrain!

6430 2018-12-30 18:24:10 Wrong approach.  Develop oil and gas, utilize massive revenue for R&D in sustainable energy (solar, wind, battery technology) and electric vehicle charging stations and infrastructure across Canada.  Get costs comparable or below petro vehicles and people will naturally migrate.
6431 2018-12-30 18:24:09 Did you know Trump sold off 15% of the strategic oil reserve to lower the deficit that arose from the tax cuts?  When oil prices were low?  So it would look like another trillion dollars hadn’t been added to the deficit?

6435 2018-12-30 18:23:43 It’s all in his plans to repay his debtors, could not get it done with oil situation so let’s try steel.
6436 2018-12-30 18:23:41 She made them from her homegrown tree. She made hash oil and the cookirs/brownies don't taste anything like tree. So shocked myself
6437 2018-12-30 18:23:33 White flag! White flag!!   it time I don't like Prussia, he's very firm, you thing Virgin olive oil comes from???
6438 2018-12-30 18:23:08 In hindsight the orchestration was masterful. Landlocked Canadian heavy oil which US refiners need and now buy at steep discount while exporting light shale oil. Brilliant from a tactical perspective, saddening when you see how badly  was outplayed.
6439 2018-12-30 18:23:05 Canada already has environmental controls in place. Better to support oil and gas in Canada rather than purchase from Saudi Arabia where they have no controls. Which is better for our earth?  We are still part of the big picture.
6440 2018-12-30 18:23:05 Gase thought he’d help Tannehill’s stock value. Instead.... what team will sign him except as a back up at low dollar value
6441 2018-12-30 18:23:05 Good. Most people don't know about that. Someone I know brought a brand new WRX STI and blew the motor because of oil starvation.

6444 2018-12-30 18:22:53 Mika’s allergy-kind fast hummus recipe:
1 can chic peas (rinsed)
Glugs of olive oil*
juice from 1 lemon or lime
salt

Optional depending on allergies/availability:
Seasame oil
Tahini

* less-virgin is actually best for funky molecular science reasons
6445 2018-12-30 18:22:50 Under cap & trade oil companies had to buy credits from others which worked like a tax on them. So it really was the equivalent. Nevertheless this has little to do with the drop in prices as we all know.

6447 2018-12-30 18:22:18 Isn't it a bummer when ur feeling all macho, going to ur chainsaw guy because it won't start and it turns out some IDIOT filled the fuel tank with bar oil? I could hear his thoughts, "hey man, you can go next door and grab a manicure while I fix this."

What, you mean like introducing the hero by having him rescue a bunch of people from an oil rig? Good idea. Maybe follow it up with a flashback of him saving a bus full of kids. Then maybe he could save all life on Earth. I'd watch. 
6455 2018-12-30 18:21:11 Fine. But what about your home or rent? Who pays for that? Saudi oil? Greenpeace? Soros?

(Personal attacks often say more about the person using them than the actual victi. I figured you didn't have a cottage. Those people live in elite cities!)
6456 2018-12-30 18:21:09 Did you get your info from your oil industrial friends, wacko?
6457 2018-12-30 18:21:05 They told me 16 years ago when I had my son (who’s Dad works oil) that it’s a dying field, steer him elsewhere. 16 years. This isn’t some new NDP problem. I feel bad for jobs being phased out but it happens, to many industries unfortunately.
6458 2018-12-30 18:21:00 Not too long ago a large deposit of oil was located here in Texas. I'm hopeful to see the price drop a little lower, even if it's just 2 cents a gallon.
6459 2018-12-30 18:21:00 My dad woke me up to take me to get my car oil changed.... then took me to Sam’s to go grocery shopping, I feel betrayed
6460 2018-12-30 18:20:51 Pisces sun, Taurus moon/venus/rising. I either wear a rose oil spray or a lavender one, I don’t use actual perfumes generally
6461 2018-12-30 18:20:50 The police and the government have no image anymore but as for the nation maybe because our oil is still flowing and we still pass budgets
6462 2018-12-30 18:20:20 Lifted an FA cup in 1904 and other trophies since then and before the oil money but because we haven’t had a glittered history you feel the need to say we don’t have history. You haven’t won a league title since 1990 and spent hundreds of millions. Embarrassing.
6463 2018-12-30 18:20:11 Now if California changes their legalities around manufacture of CBD oil products derived from hemp.  Many businesses are under fire as being illegal.

6466 2018-12-30 18:19:47 How do they define "demand"? If China is filling up their storage tanks with cheap oil, does that count as demand or do they actually have to use the oil to count as demand? Importers should be stocking up and filling storage now like crazy. This won't last.
6467 2018-12-30 18:19:46 Hella lip gloss, black soap, rose water, black hair dye (year supply ), concealer, braiding hair, eye brow pencils, black castor oil shampoo and conditioner (2 bottles each), nose rings, lashes and lash glue, hair ties, hoop earrings, eco styler gel, and Murray’s bees wax
6468 2018-12-30 18:19:43 essential oil diffusers are just juuls for adults
6469 2018-12-30 18:19:41 Roasted potatoes too (rosemary theoretically optional but I'll put rosemary on anything savory at all TBH, that being said you could easily get away with just salt and pepper.) Just baste them with a cooking oil of your choice and cook on 400+ degrees for 20 minutes-ish.
6470 2018-12-30 18:19:37 Bleurgh, bad timing for boiler to pack in. Turns out that gauge telling us our oil tank is half full lied (or maybe we just read it wrong)  #failedatcountryliving

6473 2018-12-30 18:19:22 You forget that Ontario pays a lot more into equalization than Alberta does. Plus let's not forget about the billions in oil subsidies that we all contribute. Ingrate.
6474 2018-12-30 18:19:13 I use cbd oil for my anxiety/ocd have been on it for almost a year works pretty dam good. I use hemplucid, that’s the brand 1500 mg bottle. It’s pricey but helps a ton.
6475 2018-12-30 18:19:12 I snugged two Singaporean roti pratas (prata bread) into my stomach last midnight. Good stuff for a quick snack, though one needs to prepare some oil, frying pan, and about six minutes of his/her life. Sprinkle some (brown) sugar to spice things up.
6476 2018-12-30 18:19:10 coconut oil can be fine on various parts of your body but only if it’s pure & not some cooking nonsense from the store. it ALSO has a larger molecular size which means your skin does not absorb it as well aka comedogenic so using it on your face is a bad move.

6483 2018-12-30 18:18:25 The same commodity that reliance upon by the SNP in 2014 would have seen an indy Scotland bankrupt.  Nobody is gloatong about the impact on the oil industry, just pointing out the lack of wisdom in relying on a volatile commodity the market value of which is out of our control.
6484 2018-12-30 18:18:24 legit mak aku call go shop pukul 2 pagi nak beli ultra v beauty oil. hm.
6485 2018-12-30 18:18:21 jajajajja sorry I'm sarcastic. While USA and Trump keep over producing, OIL will fall until 30 dollars per barel, it's too cheap, it's like ''free oil for America'', obviously I won't happen. No related with Venezuela.
6486 2018-12-30 18:18:16 No one anticipated oil money and tv money to take over like it has.
6487 2018-12-30 18:18:13 Tell that to the laid off oil workers and struggling seniors. Oh to be one of your chosen ones. Seems like if you don’t support the @liberal_party there is nothing. It’s time you started serving all Canadians.
6488 2018-12-30 18:18:12 Estée Lauder Double Wear  Light!!!! Dude it’s expensive but my skin is DRY as FUCK and loves it. Also my gf is a manager at Sephora and says the most important thing for a dewey look is to use an oil underneath and moisturize the hell out of your face underneath
6489 2018-12-30 18:18:06 Well, he drives a car, so he's contributing to the oil economy. 
6490 2018-12-30 18:18:05 Lmao. I mean be safe with money. Maintaining a turbo driven motor is a cocksucking task. Oil changes at 3000 miles instead 5000, checking your oil levels daily. Just a pain in the ass.
6491 2018-12-30 18:18:01 Guess all baby killers have something in common. Kill for oil.
6492 2018-12-30 18:17:56 I don't doubt that - it's AB's chief export, so I'd hope so! But O&G is just not a major industry in CA. AB produces 10x more oil with 1/10th the population. Production has been cut in half in last 3 decades, so the industry is likely to die a natural death in another 3.
6493 2018-12-30 18:17:54 I have no idea what prices are like in Norman now. When I was there, there was a ton of excess capacity off campus because of the oil bust, so you could get a pretty nice pad for like $400/month. 

The fraternity housing board wants to raise dues to like $900/month w. room&board.

6499 2018-12-30 18:17:15 More fool you for spending that much to go to a place like that. My point is I don’t care about empty seats, oil money, bought trophies, small club or any of that shite. 
6500 2018-12-30 18:17:05 I was expecting an oil drum.

6502 2018-12-30 18:16:53 Sorry but you are NOT normal from Med Hat.  These people are protesting a Globalist dictator that’s running Canada into the ground.  Has destroyed jobs in Alberta. Buys Saudi oil when we have our own. Taxes on pollution while he jets around the globe weekly.

6507 2018-12-30 18:16:07 Yeeeeeee just mix good oils in there but castor oil is great. But only if you keep using it regularly. Make a routine and I promise you’ll see change in less than 2 weeks.
6508 2018-12-30 18:16:06 I want to try oil paint
6509 2018-12-30 18:16:04 Yes, Let’s not ever work towards greener energy because we are all reliant on oil right now.
6510 2018-12-30 18:15:59 This organization is just a front for oil companies. Social media dude, you're helping some bad people my friend.
6511 2018-12-30 18:15:59 What is your point..this Union Iron Worker got to keep his home because of the oil sands...Ontario under Wynne was a disaster..I was accepted in Alberta from Local 720 with open arms. I was not the only Ontario Union Tradesperson that the Oil Sands and pipelines kept the light on

6517 2018-12-30 18:15:19 @Oil_Drop My original mention favouring DeBrusk on the air referred only to broadcast. You know, as others do, that it's necessary to be positive if possible in any area. But sometimes seeking the positive looks more like evading the issue.
6518 2018-12-30 18:15:14 It's my sister's -- there aren't actual amounts, everything's done to taste. For the lamb: 
-Combine cilantro, mint, lemon juice, olive oil, ginger-garlic paste, garam masala, and salt in a food processor until it forms a paste
-Set some aside to combine with yogurt for the sauce
6519 2018-12-30 18:15:11 I've never tried oil and believe it's poss to mix it with nicotine as I stop smoking, I probably smoke half z a wk how much oil would that be compared to

6522 2018-12-30 18:15:02 It would be great if we had some LNG or oil to sell them. I hear that shipping it from BC is the fastest way. It would also be good if there was a pipeline to transport these resources to the coast. Oh well.
6523 2018-12-30 18:14:57 Motor oil
6524 2018-12-30 18:14:56 The minister is telling a lie. It has everything to do with oil prices - world oil prices not to mention Canadian dependence on American currency values. This is so far past the realm of provincial government. Also, as a consumer, the price of gas isn’t worthy of conversation.

6532 2018-12-30 18:13:59 my hair doesn’t really like oils but argan oil seems to soften and rejuvenate my hair, alone with shea butter and it’s lit
6533 2018-12-30 18:13:57 I get a spooley (however you spell it) and put some oil on it and brush it through my lashes. Equally I use my fingers and make sure I’m putting it on the root of the eyelash!
6534 2018-12-30 18:13:50 So, mum is going to the oil rig tomorrow 
6535 2018-12-30 18:13:50 Its not oil its about jealousy, sarso mean agg lagana
6536 2018-12-30 18:13:46 Industry just wants stability and certainty so to them a carbon tax may be a necessary evil, saying that no one can deny that investment in the oil patch is moving away from Canada to jurisdictions without a carbon tax such as the USA.
6537 2018-12-30 18:13:31 It feels so nice to be able to fill up the car for a reasonable price. We were ripped off big time on gas prices here for many years while the rest of North America never suffered the same fleecing. The oil companies get no pity from me. They had us bent over the barrel to long.

Due to the New Year's Day, this week is a shortened trading week as well. While the liquidity may be lower than normal, the volatility is expected to be high. Be careful of this double-edged sword.
6550 2018-12-30 18:12:11 I've spent about 40k oil on this fucking B4 now... pls Deutschland come home...
6551 2018-12-30 18:12:08 I ain’t wasting a $19.99 oil change coupon on current Sunny..
6552 2018-12-30 18:12:00 What I want to know is, is it best to vape oil or dry herb vape, I have a arizer desk top and pretty good portable but I've only used these when I GMO that isn't possible these days. I used large amounts dry herb vaping I found a small piece ground didn't go far
6553 2018-12-30 18:11:58 When god said You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. He meant that thing

6557 2018-12-30 18:11:48 Compare the dosage amount with how much CBD is in it to get the best prices too. I get high strength oil and take less of it cos it ends up less expensive that way!
6558 2018-12-30 18:11:48 Don’t take this greed for oil to space
6559 2018-12-30 18:11:36 Yep. They had an interview on the news where oil workers were laughing about making so much more than the teachers who tried to convince them not to drop out. Plenty of my family dropped out in grade 8-11 to work up north. They have been up and down since.
6560 2018-12-30 18:11:36 The fossil fuel industry is the equivalent of the tobacco company marketing fake doubts abt climate change & you are staking your flag in the ground to defend them.He signed a pledge not to take money from oil and gas execs. He went back on that pledge and you blindly support it.

6565 2018-12-30 18:10:08 To bad they are lost to the big oil lobby. I think I will start a petition to have the Trans mountain pipeline renamed to the Justin Trudeau pipeline. He needs to own this decision.
6566 2018-12-30 18:10:04 I need a new oil plug :((

6569 2018-12-30 18:09:59 It's the bogeyman of that snake oil that Jordan Peterson sells.

Emmanuel Goldstein made intangible, all the better for the two minutes' hate.

Can I have that metaphor bridge now?
6570 2018-12-30 18:09:58 Beto will kill us all because of his loyalty to Big Oil and Gas.

#GreenNewDeal must be one of our top priorities! Otherwise we will be forced to rally #YellowVestUSA
6571 2018-12-30 18:09:54 Hi Charlatan! 
Hope you are having a great day, passing out lies and profiting from them selling patent cures and snake oil.

6573 2018-12-30 18:09:18 This is why the Right sneers at 'snowflakes' 'virtue signaling' etc. In Theodore Roosevelt era we actually embraced idea of a Common Good, rather than selfishness. All wd agree #BadNRG oil coal and gas is not in the public interest. We have alternatives now
6574 2018-12-30 18:09:15 So exactly how does solar replace oil?? Transport trucks require fuel. Living in remote areas requires fuel, electric vehicles still don't have range required. 
How much of a carbon footprint for battery storage, no solar at night.

6577 2018-12-30 18:08:53 Well the minister is stating that the lower gas prices in Ontario are the doing of the provincial government. So they must also be responsible for lower gas prices throughout the country. It has nothing to do with lower oil prices.

6581 2018-12-30 18:08:37 Nikolas Tesla believed that natural, renewable, sources of energy could “eliminate the need of coal, oil, gas or any other of the common fuels.” Tesla wanted to use the SUN, wind, oceans and other natural resources instead. 
Yet, we are still being led the opposite way.
6582 2018-12-30 18:08:36 11-8-19 in 34 games would be great for an Oil winger. That’s Aberg’s line in Ana (tho zip in last 4.) Oil sure showed him not to miss a practice. If Zykov blooms in desert we’ll really have to wonder. Maybe they’re all interchangeable parts but I don’t see Yamo ready for NHL yet.
6583 2018-12-30 18:08:35 @potheadhair just got a Nye discount code in my email (I was hoping for one so I can buy the oil) and it doesn't seem to be working. 
6584 2018-12-30 18:08:33 Whisky (£4.36billion exports), fish, oil, gas, forestry, all producing reveue, renewable energy supplied to the UK national grid, natural harbours and geology suited to the basing of nuclear subs and weapons, 61% of UK's territorial waters, where all the oil is, and lots more.
6585 2018-12-30 18:08:26 Every time I put my ear into a barrel of oil, I hear nothing but glug glug... :P
6586 2018-12-30 18:08:23 ...i use coconut oil and vitamin E
6587 2018-12-30 18:08:19 And that number as virtually not changed in the last 10 yrs.  Mean while oil consumption just passed 100m barrels/day while Canada is to stupid to take the worlds money.
6588 2018-12-30 18:08:17 Oil prices are down around the world, including in Quebec, where we have a carbon tax. It's nothing to do with Ford.

6592 2018-12-30 18:07:47 I know what the actual votes are for, and many are deplorable. Like voting against offshore oil drilling ban or voting for Trump’s deportation force.
6593 2018-12-30 18:07:41 I waiver between anger and pity. Like so many americans, Cohen was fooled by a snake oil salesman...and I can't help but see the parallels with Hitler's rise and trump's.

6595 2018-12-30 18:07:36 Affordability is understood. To each his/her own. I recall my days pumping gas in oil crisis 1973. Whole shift at the pumps, freezing cold. The VW guy says keep the change, the Cadillac guy counts every penny. Truth. The money comes back, IMO, in unquantifiable ways.

6621 2018-12-30 18:05:19 I disagree. The best companies are down to 15$/b in the Permian. The oil sands mining companies are in the 20-30$ range BUT that is based off of a 50 year mine life. The Permian is also plagued with pipeline constraints(new capacity coming in Q4 2019) so they are not getting

6623 2018-12-30 18:04:50 We are NOT trying. We are PRETENDING to try.
Oil industry gets mostly exemptions from ctax. The little they do have to pay is dedicated from royalties they should pay. We're expanding our output. TMX alone means ROC needs to cut emissions by 80%.
6624 2018-12-30 18:04:39 In Auburn getting my oil changed & tires rotated lol. What should I eat for lunch  #hungry
6625 2018-12-30 18:04:37 Siitä täysin samaa mieltä että ostotoiminan, hankintojen ja ihan perus hankintalainkin tuntemusta pitäisi kaikkia parantaa. Enemmän kompetentti ostaja olisi kaikkien etu. Sama firma toki pärjää myös todella kilpailuilla yksityisillä sektoreilla. Esim globaali Oil & Gas hallussa
6626 2018-12-30 18:04:31 Custom statistics show #Iran's ultra-light oil (gas condensate) exports stopped during last Iranian month (Nov.21 - Dec.22). Its 9 months exports (March 21-Dec.22) stood at 5.331mn mt ($2.776bn), or less than 9-month of last fiscal year.
Iran's fiscal year starts on March 21.

6636 2018-12-30 18:03:21 Ford doesn’t control global oil prices. The low gas prices are due to a decrease in oil prices around the world. Many other provinces in Canada have low gas prices. There was never a carbon tax on gas prices in Ontario, so factually inaccurate.

I think if you avoid processed food, that is the belly of the benefit, as you approach the tails, due to thin tailed nature of nutrition (there are no 1 magic food), the benefits decrease drastically

6646 2018-12-30 18:02:37 Even CARB notes their focus is not on producer:

“There’s only so much you can do if you’re pumping a particular kind of crude oil. If you’re having to use some sort of heat intensified method to do it or you’re fracking, then you kind of have what you have at that point.”

And to the east of that, provincial capital of Deir Ezzor (one of the largest cities in Syria). While that battle was going on, the international coalition was busy capturing oil fields in unpopulated areas.
6672 2018-12-30 18:00:48 A little marvel mystery oil or transmission fluid in the cylinders for a few days, and fresh oil plus some motor honey in the crankcase.
Rock crank until free, crank to work out oil in cylinders.
Not a proper fix but it's something the old timers did back in the day.

6678 2018-12-30 17:59:59 3rd thing - let's discuss US shale decline rates in 2 years, my guess is they will srprse a lot of people. 4th thing - too little cap ex in conventional oil will cause a super spike in oil. Shale can't make up for dmnd grwth for much longer. Need to see where the puck is going.

6681 2018-12-30 17:59:28 As someone who believes honestly that Trudeau is endangering us to placate oil interests, I didn’t see it that way at all. I read the article, read your tweets, liked the first and skipped over the rest. Just saying, lots of reasons to “like” something, or not.

6694 2018-12-29 23:58:47 if you've taken a basic economics course, or have self-educated on the subject, you should be aware that when supply rises and demand stagnates, the value of the commodity goes down rapidly.

if you're interested in the oil glut, I have a (capitalist) talkshow about that
6695 2018-12-29 23:58:45 "You may think I'm paying for this coffee, but actual it was the mechanic that gave me a discount on my car's oil change 10 years ago" 

Saying a renegotiated NAFTA is the same as paying for a wall is as dumb a statement as the above one.

6697 2018-12-29 23:58:40 Jerry gone take care of his. That oil Money long. Ya heard me
6698 2018-12-29 23:58:24 I mean literally selling empty barrels to other oil producers, at this point, would be a more profitable option. But continuing to raise production, as we apparently intend to do,  seems like a bad plan.
6699 2018-12-29 23:58:14 Oil money ftw
6700 2018-12-29 23:58:10 You been living under a rock? All the current North Sea work is in DECOMMISSIONING ie NOT extraction of oil. They laid them off because of the oil price crash & the fact it wasn’t cost effective to extract 
6701 2018-12-29 23:58:08 I'm sorry, but on what basis is "gold expensive relative to other commodities" ?  Value is always and everywhere subjective, but from the perspective of those who *make* the stuff, (an important perspective)! gold is much cheaper than base metals/oil, etc.
6702 2018-12-29 23:59:56 cuck oil?? si no saben palabras en ingles por que hacen el ridiculo? ni investigan... que verguenza. meter en un saco que en el cuckold el esposo limpia a la esposa?... de donde saco eso?
6703 2018-12-29 23:59:31 Just a normal oil change is anywhere from $20 at Meineke to $45 at a dealership, but you can pay more for more expensive packages.
6704 2018-12-29 23:59:20 Sharks get healthy on (fish) Oil.
Or any good cooking oil, just make sure u use “oil”

6707 2018-12-29 23:59:05  way too spooky!
#orange is fab oil for boosting your mood  I was brought lots of essential oils for Christmas for my diffuser, working my way through them, always loved orange x
6708 2018-12-29 23:59:01 14 year old me at the draft party in rexall was so high off the McDavid pick I remember being happy we got a former high pick Oil King. Oh to be young and naive

6710 2018-12-29 23:58:54 Regular oil? High mileage or full synthetic? That is high though.
6711 2018-12-29 23:58:50 Thanks for adding. I also left out the environment, clean energy & animals. At least he loves concrete, oil, one-use plastics, toxic chemicals, concrete & charcoal, though.

6713 2018-12-29 23:58:50 Venezuela doesn’t have bountiful resources, it’s one dimensional the entire economy is driven by oil. I also forgot to add stable government to my original list.
6714 2018-12-29 23:58:47 if you've taken a basic economics course, or have self-educated on the subject, you should be aware that when supply rises and demand stagnates, the value of the commodity goes down rapidly.

if you're interested in the oil glut, I have a (capitalist) talkshow about that
6715 2018-12-29 23:58:45 "You may think I'm paying for this coffee, but actual it was the mechanic that gave me a discount on my car's oil change 10 years ago" 

Saying a renegotiated NAFTA is the same as paying for a wall is as dumb a statement as the above one.

6723 2018-12-29 23:57:49 What about $5 billion dollars of investment in native lands?

Not just health care and needed infrastructure.

But securing sacred places from commercialization and from destruction due to mineral and oil extraction?

6724 2018-12-29 23:57:40 I use to make everything. Is necessary to use a little oil,  because the food can to stay dry
6725 2018-12-29 23:57:36 Nightly Specials!

Soup:  curried roasted zucchini puree  

Salad: Spring mix tossed in olive oil with salt + pepper & lemon juice, chickpeas, red onion, goat cheese, and candied walnuts

Risotto:  Caramelized Cipollini onions, spinach, and roasted tomatoes 
6726 2018-12-29 23:57:24 the niacinamide & hylauronic acid  have you tried the squalene oil? it made my pores so much smaller you have to try it
6727 2018-12-29 23:57:23 That’s REAL SYRUP
NO MOTOR OIL
Leave the fakes in 2018 
6728 2018-12-29 23:57:20 Not with that term
6729 2018-12-29 23:57:16 That is 100% untrue, GOP passed their tax cuts through a procedure called budget reconciliation, which allows a bill to pass the Senate with a majority (and, avoid the need for Democratic votes).
AND USED IT TO REPEAL PARTS OF ACA...BUT NOT THE WALL? U R A SNAKE OIL SALESMAN!
6730 2018-12-29 23:57:16 There's probable, proven and recoverable, big differences in probably. Why is climate science all about oil. The fear from vested interests is growing 
6731 2018-12-29 23:57:09 I was eating. Pasta (spaghetti) finished in a sauce of three cheeses (Parm, Asiago and I can’t remember how to spell the third.) the finish is done in hot olive oil with a tblsp of fresh pepper - very fast. 
I will be alone for New Years. Debating what to enjoy. Yum for yours.
6732 2018-12-29 23:57:07 Ohh because Saudi oil is so much better?  And if you bothered to look how much Canada’s largest energy company and the Alberta government invests into research of alternate energy then you would change your tune. Right now it would be a childish dream to expect a sudden change.
6733 2018-12-29 23:56:51 Yup. I get how everyone likes to put a team's drafting record on the GM but I do not. For a guy in Gretzky's role & the scouts, they deserve the credit or blame, not the GM. Being good at one doesn't mean you'd be good at the other.
6734 2018-12-29 23:56:17 It's the glorious union of eggs and oil—MAYONNAISE!
6735 2018-12-29 23:56:15 I only use olive oil or butter for frying. Stopped buying that rubbish masquerading as margarine years ago.
6736 2018-12-29 23:56:06 Those 12-0/undefeated shirts will make good oil rags or toilet paper in a pinch. #GoIrish
6737 2018-12-29 23:56:01 The Delta/ bid-ask difference/ seem to me to be sort of an oil pressure gauge.  Tape and DOM first so you can see where liquidity is.  Remember Institutions need liquidity to move large size without us knowing about it.
6738 2018-12-29 23:55:42 @keona_cc Wassup, tryna go out and be my beard oil?
6739 2018-12-29 23:55:31 @JoeVargas is CBD oil good for carpal tunnel?
6740 2018-12-29 23:55:30 Thankyou. I use just walnut oil with a few drops of ylang ylang xx
6741 2018-12-29 23:55:20 you need to take into account amount of debt and also the size of oil in the ground, not only based on current production bopd. #TXP
6742 2018-12-29 23:55:18 Hard science, “facts” proves necessity for lowered carbon emissions.

Today we have the technology to provide power to the World through renewable energies within 10 years if implicated.

Yes, we need oil to make these devices that will lower carbon emissions.
6743 2018-12-29 23:55:18 Bernie is the only candidate that can beat Trump. Beto is a right wing corporate democrat who broke his own pledge on not accepting donations from the oil industry. Beto also voted to deregulate wall st and fast track tpp. He couldn't even beat ted cruz.
6744 2018-12-29 23:55:05 I pay 39.95 at Hyundai dealerships in Salt Lake and Vegas. That includes 40 point inspection and typically oil change and rotate and balance tires if needed.
6745 2018-12-29 23:55:04 Any oil jig for this??
6746 2018-12-29 23:55:03 You could counter that argument with money from taxes is greater and if they actually taxed large corporation's effectively they'd be greater profit. Perhaps if governments didn't sell off publicly owned industries, profits from the oil would b generated regardless of who buys it
6747 2018-12-29 23:54:54 I threw out the rest of my Klonopin. I’m done with psych meds. CBD oil was working just fine for my anxiety  I feel like the last six months of my life have been eaten by these drugs

6751 2018-12-29 23:54:43 Stop pushing for war the American people do not want to send their children to die on foreign chores over oil so knock it off!
6752 2018-12-29 23:54:39 Now you can upgrade to gun oil
6753 2018-12-29 23:54:06 I like Shea moisture, olive oil products, & creme of nature mostly.
6754 2018-12-29 23:53:58 because of increases in agricultural efficiency and a growing tech-oriented economy, they haven't had anything like the crash of Venezuela or Ecuador.

there's been a massive oil glut that's being caused partially by Saudi Arabia and the US trying to drop it while it's hot,
6755 2018-12-29 23:53:47 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
6756 2018-12-29 23:53:40 The Ely steam sauna is a dream it's just naked women young and old sitting around with an essential oil filled sauna telling stories
6757 2018-12-29 23:53:31 Vitamin E oil is great for your skin. It keeps it looking young and plump!
6758 2018-12-29 23:53:23 Now this, if true, is useful. And I imagine if you can clean oil off of seabirds, you can jolly well use it on ur favorite dog.
6759 2018-12-29 23:52:52 I challenge them all to go one day living what they preach. No oil would amaze them as they walk naked in a field. Bout all you can do where oil is not a part of the activity.
6760 2018-12-29 23:52:44 Rex Murphy: "Actually murdering journalists is good ps so is oil"
6761 2018-12-29 23:52:44 pake tisu magic atau titan oil.. lu ngewe ga kerasa tapi tahan lama dan cewe lu keenakan :)
6762 2018-12-29 23:52:44 US foreign policy is an unqualified disaster. Switching it out for Putin's policy of protecting his oil business is worse and anyone who denies this has no credibility.
6763 2018-12-29 23:52:32 Swish coconut oil w/ oregano and Pennyroyal essential oils, every morning.. 16 oz. of homemade Kombucha daily,  plus #BalanceOfNature, and ginger-lime water.... No chemicals...
I'm good.
6764 2018-12-29 23:52:27 Well I'm sure it's all because of the oil industry. And I'm sure there are plenty of people happy to argue the oil industry has only poisoned them.
6765 2018-12-29 23:52:26 When Western Canadian discontent is being measured only by polls of Albertans by who either don’t feel represented in Ottawa or who want out of confederation...it generalizes feelings that aren’t necessarily shared by the rest of Western Canada, whether they support oil or not.
6766 2018-12-29 23:52:21 9% yield with full coverage growing double digits annually. $EVA is not down as much as other MLPs because it’s a better business with less oil price exposure.
6767 2018-12-29 23:51:59 Waiting at the same baggage carousel as two flights from Calgary. Heart warmed remembering kids last night at the game chanting “let’s go Oil Kings, CALGARY SUCKS”. Resisting doing the chant here. Most folks coming back this way probably think Calgary sucks too.
6768 2018-12-29 23:51:59 Oh really? The oil companies just laid off hundreds of workers for a laugh did they? Get real! 
6769 2018-12-29 23:51:48 can’t wait to run my man a shower, pour oil on the floor, then beat him w/ a belt 
6770 2018-12-29 23:51:28 Wait, so are you still doing the grated ginger and castor oil treatment on your hair?  But seriously, you are letting out a calm, comfortable and happy vibe with this new looks.  It makes me happy to see you this way. Ok and envy a few things too 
6771 2018-12-29 23:51:26 they'll fry her in de oil 
6772 2018-12-29 23:51:22 the snake oil salesman will make everything better!
6773 2018-12-29 23:51:18 Uses some cooking oil in the fuel mix - great - but not sustainable in any sense of the term.
6774 2018-12-29 23:51:17 What a load of crap - Canada is in deep economic trouble - Liberal/NDP govt killed the oil sands = Carbon Tax will bankrupt the country --- Unemployment numbers are false due to "holiday employment" which are all part-time and ALL bad paying.  RESIGN
6775 2018-12-29 23:51:16 You’ve abandoned the oil patch.  We need Mountain West- now.
6776 2018-12-29 23:51:08 Right now I wish I believed in Hell. You would boil in oil for eternity for your actions. You couldn't pass out or lose feeling, just the constant, panic stricken, searing pain that you deserve.
6777 2018-12-29 23:51:01 Uh my mums mind when she bought me an essential oil diffuser
6778 2018-12-29 23:50:53 we have one, makes the best fries ever and they’re not dripping in oil
6779 2018-12-29 23:50:36 Let's be honest here, if India discover oil somewhere in their country, the American government will suddenly be very interested to invade and install oil derricks....sorry, 'restore Democracy to the land and install freedom'
6780 2018-12-29 23:50:33 It’s delicious, but it’s made w/ palm oil so I’ve quit eating it. :-(
6781 2018-12-29 23:50:21 No, I googled it after I said there was 1.7t barrels of reserve. Seems the number is 1.5t/b. But having a lot of oil isn't the argument.
6782 2018-12-29 23:50:20 Trying to explain oil level and life to a woman is hard as fuck. You can’t just go off by the percentage of what your car is telling you. Bless her soul
6783 2018-12-29 23:50:17 I do Piko for bulk: tamari, vinegar, olive oil when I remember.
6784 2018-12-29 23:50:07 Rub palm oil all over your body.
6785 2018-12-29 23:50:00 Girl my regimen is TIGHTT. I have the most moisturized tangled mess on my head  
Creme of Nature Argan oil shampoo, herbal essences hello hydration condish, TGIN honey Miracle Hair Mask, CoN Coconut Milk Leave in with shea butter to seal. 
MOISTURE CITY.... but tangled AF
6786 2018-12-29 23:49:50 Not even with a record of good drafting?
6787 2018-12-29 23:49:46 I paid $65 for an oil change today. Is that a normal price to pay?
6788 2018-12-29 23:49:30 It gets extremely dangerous when oil is covering the Kyle of Lochalsh bridge.
6789 2018-12-29 23:49:28 Euphrates dams and east bank oil are very important. Good news
6790 2018-12-29 23:49:21 Thank you!!! Vitamin e oil girl 
6791 2018-12-29 23:49:20 Its purple heart yeah with a good sanding and a coat of mineral oil. :-)
6792 2018-12-29 23:49:19 If your allergies can tolerate it, get pure eucalyptus oil and take a steamy shower. Or go to a steam room if you have access.  Drink some hot tea. When my mom passed away I was sick for 2 weeks.  Grief, exhaustion and stress have a way of catching up with you. Feel better, love
6793 2018-12-29 23:49:14 引火したら、もう手遅れさ…
6794 2018-12-29 23:49:12 They should also state that he is a lobbyist. He’s often railing against climate change but the networks never mention he’s a lobbyist for oil & gas industry. I’m sure he probably shills for nra & other causes.
6795 2018-12-29 23:49:11 No onions, no oil.
6796 2018-12-29 23:49:04 I work on a farm when there is oil spilled the grass comes back heavier and greener. The public is being told a crock there is an agenda behind the scene. So the Plutocrats in BC are filling people up with environmental fears and lies. The environmentalist agenda is about $$$$$.
6797 2018-12-29 23:49:00 100% the injuries don't help but every team has to deal with it & this team simply can't. When the axe finally falls, don't be surprised if Gretzky is shown the door at the same time. As I don't think he'll be offered the gig.
6798 2018-12-29 23:48:47 Need a hot oil massage 
6799 2018-12-29 23:48:18 Awesome!!! 296 days to the election! @janephilpott #mymp got 3 votes from my household in 2015. She will not get our 4 votes in Oct!! @AndrewScheer please consider a national energy program that we can all rally around. The world wants to buy our ethical oil!! #buildthepipelines
6800 2018-12-29 23:48:15 And not only that, I got so many free oil changes for winning the bowl game that I won't have to pay for another one till around 2045. #RTB
6801 2018-12-29 23:48:11 A few years ago I brought my car to the mechanic for an oil change. The new mechanic walked out with my keys, then back minutes later... he couldn’t drive a clutch. 

His boss had to drive it into the garage & the young man was clearly embarrassed.
I hope someone taught him.
6802 2018-12-29 23:48:08 We needa talk about the power of grapeseed oil and jojoba oil more often
6803 2018-12-29 23:47:52 The argan oil hair mask from primark actually works wonders leaves your hair pure straight n silky x

6806 2018-12-29 23:47:45 Abacus Data question from October poll: “I support more oil moving through pipelines as long as the country is also moving towards cleaner forms of energy.” Nice balance
6807 2018-12-29 23:47:44 Old people think CBD oil is for criminals
6808 2018-12-29 23:47:43 TWO FN YEARS GOP CONTROLLED ALL THE GOVERNMENT INCLUDING THE BUDGET>>>NO WALL FUNDING> you jumped the gun and followed a bunch of talkers...the shut down is on you, the lack of a wall...that is on the GOP...go pound salt...you are a rank snake oil salesman! GRIFTER IN CHIEF!
6809 2018-12-29 23:47:42 hey! it says England in that picture, not Britain, and in all the others so maybe you should have used England. Nothing about the discovery of oil in Scottish waters and Scotland still being the poor relation. also that attitudes from england still remain the same
6810 2018-12-29 23:47:21 If you’re a female and you don’t use coconut oil and peppermint wipes you’re definitely missing out...glad I found out cause 
6811 2018-12-29 23:47:20 I thought Obama/Clinton/McCain/Holder/Lynch et al *were* the creators of ISIS, made to deliver the *fog of war* so they w/Genie Oil & Gas could steal Golan Heights gas, oil, Gadaffi's gold, flood EU w/migrants to destabilize forcing an EU/UN/NATO army - give up sovereignty, NWO?
6812 2018-12-29 23:47:17 Chef McElroy cut up some rotten zucchini, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was veal, along with grass.

6814 2018-12-29 23:46:58 Gas prices were Highest in 2018 relative to the price of oil.
6815 2018-12-29 23:46:58 .@lmward7. Thanks Paul- we keep oil projects in cash! Hi DT
6816 2018-12-29 23:46:56 Also oil money
6817 2018-12-29 23:46:38 No one in my family believes I’m allergic to avocados and continues using avocado oil for cooking and as a result every time I come home I always end up w a slow progression of allergic breakouts all over my body
6818 2018-12-29 23:46:38 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
6819 2018-12-29 23:46:35 I think plopping works with practice and the right towel, but I literally brush it in the shower and use a microfiber to soak the extra moisture out and let it dry before bed and sometimes put oil in it but it just depends.
6820 2018-12-29 23:46:32 I wouldn't mind wrestling you @rebeccagrants , we can get out the baby oil and see who can take down who.....  
6821 2018-12-29 23:46:27 Get a grip on reality. Facts don’t care about your personal circumstances and industries change with the times. Fact is oil is a FINITE resource - meaning there’s an end. Choose NOW to move forward, deal with the temporary uncomfortable shift, or be FORCED to. It WILL happen. 
6822 2018-12-29 23:46:26 Yes yes, plus you're splashing a few drops of balsamic vinegar into that oil, right?
6823 2018-12-29 23:46:16 I need a bottle of that oil!!!
6824 2018-12-29 23:46:03 Just a reminder: Check your engines oil.
6825 2018-12-29 23:46:03 Break out the baby oil.
6826 2018-12-29 23:45:55 So, until your greenwash bubble bursts, you're left with mass deforestation, replacing natural carbon sinks with oil plantations.
6827 2018-12-29 23:45:52 The People's Chilaquiles:
1. Chips: cut corn tortillas into triangles, fry in oil. Dry on paper towel, lightly salt. Set aside. 
2. Carnitas: cut pork roast into cubes, put in deep pan, cover with water, plenty of salt, maybe a bit of cumin garlic and onion powder. Simmer...
6828 2018-12-29 23:45:51 Which Oil I'm Using This Week...
doTERRA Frankincense Essential Oil is often called the “king of oils,” promoting feelings of peace and overall wellness when used aromatically, while topical and internal uses provide modern health benefits.
6829 2018-12-29 23:45:48 I’ve been in the workshop, oil changes & filter changes. Had company, 40000000000000000+ flies.

6831 2018-12-29 23:45:46 In the Summer of 2018 CANADIANS we’re paying record gas prices. Wait till 2019 you’ll be paying a lot more even with oil prices being low. Carbon taxes aren’t just on Gasoline and most of the Carbon levy goes back to the lazy.
6832 2018-12-29 23:45:44 @Bob_Stauffer As you suggested, they need an upgrade on D but to think that happens by moving either one of their goaltenders, isn't realistic. They don't have that kind of value. Unless, Pete is trading with himself.
6833 2018-12-29 23:45:43 #SharksHeadline Sharks Strike Oil
6834 2018-12-29 23:45:25 Good luck with that. No coastline, you think it’s hard in the dominion what would it be like attempting to run oil through a foreign country
6835 2018-12-29 23:45:17 Most people don’t like coconut oil for some reason but I like it. Use coconut oil and mix it with aloe and put it in your hair before you wash it. Thank me later.
6836 2018-12-29 23:45:16 TRUE! But… we Yankees actually pay about the same per gallon, but don't realize it, because we pay the difference with taxes that subsidize the OIL'igarchs.
6837 2018-12-29 23:45:14 #SharksHeadline Oil spill in Edmonton
6838 2018-12-29 23:45:05 The deals with the four biggest employer's in the state Tyson's , J B Hunt, WalMart , and the other. They got deals from Bill who would say if Tyson hired 5 K , new employee's then Tyson's got to dump toxic waste in the River, Hunt Got to bury their used oil same kinds of deals.
6839 2018-12-29 23:45:04 A real buzz about the place today . Long way to go , but they’ve really put pressure on the oil men
6840 2018-12-29 23:44:56 She's on the take from oil companies. So doubtful!
6841 2018-12-29 23:44:48 Just sent out my application for my oil burner license test, now it just study and wait
6842 2018-12-29 23:44:41 Just for them to bring they greasy asses back to you and say it’ll cost more cause of ya oil 
6843 2018-12-29 23:44:11 We went with oil

For gravitas
6844 2018-12-29 23:44:09 eye bags or dark circles:
~ massage coconut oil gently under your eyes for a couple minutes 
~ leave it on overnight and rinse in the morning 
this should clear your skin of any eye bags and dark circles!

6847 2018-12-29 23:44:00 definitely feeling but i personally put a tad of conditioner in my hair after i get out of the shower, some argon oil, some suave mousse ((with a particular nozzle because it works better for me)) and about a quarter size of hair gel and it usually makes my curls look amazing
6848 2018-12-29 23:43:52 With the oil patch almost shutdown , it has a ripple down effect to the car maker the leaves many more unemployed to the people and businesses they spend money at. Everybody is a loser under Trudeau, unless...
6849 2018-12-29 23:43:41 The Oil need a guy like Lites to rip them.
6850 2018-12-29 23:43:34 I think you have to fire PC now because he could make a big trade in desperation.
6851 2018-12-29 23:43:30 the ONLY thing about the reinhart trade is that at the time it was still reasonable to think that trade came from above chiarelli's head entirely. trading for a former oil king stunk of old guard
6852 2018-12-29 23:43:26 The smell is so earthy , like I’m just stepping out of my baby coconut oil brands ... so I’m trying to keep that same sweet smell . And castor oil just over powers everything
6853 2018-12-29 23:43:26 I’m a realist

And saying the oil industry is at deaths door... doesn’t make it true

If you were truly interested in a green way of life... you’d look into lithium mining and wind mills killing bats and birds..

Instead of poo pooing oil
Improve your green ideals
6854 2018-12-29 23:43:26 Your face is always glowing, do you mix it with tea tree oil?
6855 2018-12-29 23:43:25 Liberal Energy Policy:

IMPORT oil from Middle East at world price

SELL Canadian oil at steep DISCOUNT to USA

Trudeau should stop lying to Canadians and put on a MAGA hat......
6856 2018-12-29 23:43:22 I seem to remember as a student in the 70s visiting a friend at Edinburgh University and seeing keep your hands off Scotland's oil posters everywhere but this was pre devolution and pre a strong SNP

6858 2018-12-29 23:43:12 I’m so sick & tired of my tax dollars propping-up the oil industry 
6859 2018-12-29 23:43:11 Hey do you remember the bit TSN ran a few years back called “oil change” which highlighted the oilers rebuild? Looking back that’s pretty funny.
6860 2018-12-29 23:43:03 Asking the bartender for an olive oil and water.
6861 2018-12-29 23:42:48 @heathcummingssr Near neighbor: live in Raymore , work in KC... Have you tried any of the brews at Flat Branch in Columbia? I went to grad school there and still make frequent trips. The green chili is excellent and my favorite is the oil change stout.
6862 2018-12-29 23:42:39 Do you recommend CBD from Greenroadsworld? I have taken some oil from their website before but have never felt anything
6863 2018-12-29 23:42:28 Looks like you were right about this one, Rob, although the injuries to the D-core don't help one bit. Certainly can't let Chiarelli make any more trades.

Best thing he did was hire Gretzky, so hopefully when he gets fired he can still redeem himself a bit.
6864 2018-12-29 23:42:23 So it’s OK that the oil and gas industry to shove it down our throats? But when we try to make it cleaner all of a sudden it’s not OK? That makes no sense. Your antiliberalism would rather see the whole planet suffer?
6865 2018-12-29 23:42:22 How can you connect Ford with the retail price of gas? Oil is a global commodity whose price is predicted on global economic factors. Some Ontario folks are beginning to show  tendencies of American GOP voter ignorance. Premier Ford doesn’t know what he is talking about
6866 2018-12-29 23:42:16 This sounds like the most perfect way to spend New Years. I recommend you find a bath bomb with CBD oil in it; such things exist.
6867 2018-12-29 23:42:15 Just had french fries in the new Air Fryer...I knew yal were lying when you said they taste just like they were deep fried in oil smh
6868 2018-12-29 23:42:12 Only 2.81% of all scientific research papers about palm oil look at environmental and biodiversity. How are we meant to manage palm oil sustainability if we haven’t got the knowledge we need to implement strategies that work? #PalmOil
6869 2018-12-29 23:42:10 Liberal Carbon Tax = people pay, big polluters get a pass, Saudi OIl gets a pass, and the Liberals line their coffers with the extra GST on the inflated price of everything.

Repeat step 1, 2, and 3, put in a burrito or on top of a burger.

6875 2018-12-29 23:41:22 split ends: 
~ mix honey with olive oil on the dead ends of your hair 
this should even out your hair and treat the dead ends!
6876 2018-12-29 23:41:22 I never said they weren’t organised- my point is they “if they were to invade the ussr” had to do it when they did in 1941 because they were running out of oil to do so- invading France and ussr are two different kettle of fish
6877 2018-12-29 23:41:22 I left the house with castor oil on my brows ... no shame
6878 2018-12-29 23:41:22 When industries pack up and leave, jobs being cut by the thousands and foreign oil is being imported at the same time, and the federal government does nothing, then there is a huge problem. Call it what you want. Just remember this, we are losing homes and and our lively hood
6879 2018-12-29 23:41:16 Hahah clearly. They were just accepting demonic forces. No prayer vigil, no anointing oil, no one even screamed “blood of Jesus” 
6880 2018-12-29 23:41:12 I feel most right wingers just bring him up as some sort of left wing, CBC-connected boogie man, out to steal Alberta’s oil......

6884 2018-12-29 23:40:33 add the oil fires in the Gulf War? contribute much or not really get blown high enough into the atmosphere?
6885 2018-12-29 23:40:25 You could also argue that the UKs 65 million used up more oil found off Scotland than the Norwegian 4.5 million did of theirs so they could export more.

6887 2018-12-29 23:40:19 Oh, I saw it coming. I was so certain that Trump would be elected president that I almost bought$10,000 of Bitcoin at $400 a share, that later went to $19000 per share. Along with shares of shale oil company stock.
But I didn't , because finances were tight . . . FU ¢K Hahaha
6888 2018-12-29 23:40:18 I do quinoa, mixed beans, avocado, feta, tomato, salt, pepper and olive oil frequently. Delish cold salad
6889 2018-12-29 23:40:14 I used to use coconut oil spray, shit would soothe the pain lol
6890 2018-12-29 23:40:11 これはおっぱいじゃなくて油の貯蔵庫だよ。最悪の事態の時はここから、ね。
6891 2018-12-29 23:40:11 Just so we are clear, this wasn't the case of the Oilers not showing up. This was a case of one team, San Jose Sharks, being that much better than them.
6892 2018-12-29 23:40:03 acne:
~ apply raw honey on your breakouts, put on a bandaid and rinse off in the morning 
~ or you can apply tea tree oil on your acne with a cotton ball 
one of these remedies should clear up your acne depending on your skin type!
6893 2018-12-29 23:39:59 Awesome tip by 97. If only there were one more period, the Oil would have a chance. #Oilers

Diaper rash cream is high in zinc oxide which will:
- reduce inflammation 
- reduce oil production 
- kill da pimple 
- soothe the pimples
- reduce redness
- lighten acne scars

6898 2018-12-29 23:39:37 Trump continues to will fully & ignorantly worsen climate change by defying Obama's important rules endangering us all because all of Trump's income comes from oil deals with Russia, as Eric told us in 2015

6900 2018-12-29 23:39:32 Karen your account was created Aug 2018 and it has zero followers. I’m assuming you are a bot. But I’ll respond. Ocean issues: acidification, warning, organic waste increase, cyanobacteria blooms, artificial waste disasters (oil, plastic), current changes ... no it’s doing worse.
6901 2018-12-29 23:39:21 By the way, legislative lightweight...in Missouri, the popular measures overwhelmingly one even as the same Berner/Trunp level idiots who voted for them voted REPUBLICAN...because that is what people do when people like you come along and sell them snake oil.
6902 2018-12-29 23:39:21 why did my cat eat my fish oil pills ????????
6903 2018-12-29 23:39:21 I got some frizz control oil for my hair and bruhhhh it makes my hair so soft, I literally just wanna bathe in this shit
6904 2018-12-29 23:39:17 And exports and imports have never been zero. No even during oil embargoes.
6905 2018-12-29 23:39:12 Maybe we should start asking teachers, unions (media) and  government employees (climate scientists) who have their pension funds full to the brim with failing green energy bonds about their motivations for being anti oil????

Keep selling the snake oil for those who are clueless or have other agendas!
6907 2018-12-29 23:38:40 Best trick I learned from working in a kitchen was - ice bath your onions. Helps keep the oil and onion juicing as much. Also keep your knives sharper to reduce the spray. (Also onions rule.)
6908 2018-12-29 23:38:38 You mean like Obama’s failed wind farms that cost us billions?
6909 2018-12-29 23:38:20  I put some argon oil to grease my scalp shit felt like I made it tighter

6915 2018-12-29 23:38:03 And Saskatchewan oil.
6916 2018-12-29 23:37:56 So, let me get this straight. Beto taking 400,000 from oil and gas executives means that he’s owned by big oil, but 80 million from small donors means absolutely nothing? Is this really your take?
6917 2018-12-29 23:37:47 so recently, Saudi Arabia has been colluding with the US to deflate the petrodollar.

did you ever know that about 95% of Venezuela's exports are oil?
Ecuador also exports oil, but it's only about 45% of their total exports.
Uruguay, on the other hand, is a net importer of oil.
6918 2018-12-29 23:37:45 Many are not scientists or artists. Most are rich from oil only I guess.
6919 2018-12-29 23:37:44 Took my car in for an oil change and I was prepared for them to tell me it needed everything fixed but nope my car is good 
6920 2018-12-29 23:37:41 I need someone to oil my scalp  I don’t feel like it right now
6921 2018-12-29 23:37:34 thicker eyebrows & longer eyelashes:
~ apply coconut or castor oil onto your eyebrows and eyelashes
~ leave in on overnight and rinse it off in the morning
it will take a couple weeks but in the end it’s totally worth it!
6922 2018-12-29 23:37:20 Tamanu oil itu apaaaa

6924 2018-12-29 23:37:05 Try a little olive oil.  If you are looking for a nail girl let me know. I sell Color Street.
6925 2018-12-29 23:37:03 Exactly. Solving the egress issue would shrink that differential and make it much more profitable regardless of where the world oil price is.

6931 2018-12-29 23:35:54 My goodness, maybe some dry oil or bepanthen can help.
 I ain’t got any skin problems in the winter, summer compensates though, my face bloats and gets red and then peels:x Anyone else is like this?
6932 2018-12-29 23:35:31 Hahahahahahaha.
6933 2018-12-29 23:35:11 Christine Lagarde calls on #Angola to diversify it's economy away from oil, saying “Economic diversification in sectors other than oil is central to the success of the government’s development strategy.” Nothing new there. But it would improve the business climate.
6934 2018-12-29 23:35:01 “Imma need you to stop putting so much beard oil in yo beard. It’s starting to look like Easter basket grass.” 
6935 2018-12-29 23:34:54 Again you cannot compare Norway's economy with ours Services, Banking more important here in the UK. I was not commenting on Scotland alone. The original Tweet mentioned Scotland's oil wealth but that was shared across the UK though Scots disapproved I think

6952 2018-12-29 23:32:40 I agree 100%! I use a washcloth to exfoliate (instead of retinol) and coconut oil for moisture retention. Also, I was the least likely to have a tan as a teenager.

6955 2018-12-29 23:32:21 When people ask why I want to eliminate oil as an energy supply as fast as possible, I point to stuff like this. Every time you pump gas, you are funding evil.

6963 2018-12-29 23:30:49 You cannot compare Norway with the U.K. was the point, as in oil wealth Our oil wealth did not go just to Scotland so was shared among 65 million Norway's among 4.5 million a crude comparison
6964 2018-12-29 23:30:41 I need it to get hot so I can pour oil on my body and tan. I’m tryna be brown again
6965 2018-12-29 23:30:33 You cannot value any oil co. on such a basis- anyone taking such a survey seriously ought to read a book for beginners and soon..
6966 2018-12-29 23:30:31 As we've discussed over the last calendar yr, the coach wasn't the problem. No question, he played a part but the Oilers issues go much deeper. If they don't get all-world goaltending & a multi-pt effort on a nightly basis from 97 they're simply not good enough to sustain winning
6967 2018-12-29 23:30:07 You become innovative like "I can eat palm oil with rice now then buy 50 naira kpomo". You also begin to learn more things about your house like "wait my room paint is actually yellow not cream". Your brain automatically remembers your debtors
6968 2018-12-29 23:30:01 I cant find my baby oil gel 
6969 2018-12-29 23:30:01 Looking forward to seeing you and @TheRealBuddyGuy in a couple weeks. Rest up. You know you'll need it to burn the midnight oil w/ BG!
6970 2018-12-29 23:29:57 เอ่อออออ คือไม่รู้จะเถียงยังงัย เถียงไม่ออก ไม่เถียงละกัน แบบแค่สองเม็ดเองงงงงแหม่ 

6971 2018-12-29 23:29:54 I didn’t go out to pay my rent or get an oil change but I’m really gonna go out later to get churros and champurrado 
6972 2018-12-29 23:29:53 usual bull shit ! the collapse of the economy due to collapsing oil prices per  expert ! economists.  But Murdoch trash do not listen to experts do they! Of course provides no prove to substantiate the link. Just sheer stupid bigotry and bias
6973 2018-12-29 23:29:53 It’s 2 different greases, one for your edges & one for your hair. Then it’s an oil too
6974 2018-12-29 23:29:51 True, the holes in the roster became god damn craters once Klefbom, Russell, Chaisson got hurt.
6975 2018-12-29 23:29:46 The price of oil is down, so is the price of gas. Stop taking credit for something that has nothing to do with your policy.
6976 2018-12-29 23:29:21 OBUMMER LOL....YOU CAN KEEP YOUR CURRENT HEALTH PROVIDER LMAO!! CAN'T FIND ENOUGH OIL IN THE US SO WE'RE FORCED TO BY OIL OUTSIDE OUR COUNTRY.  YOU PEOPLE ARE SHEEP!!
6977 2018-12-29 23:29:03 Hell yeah it’s oil painting season
6978 2018-12-29 23:28:54 In only 1-2 years our greatest natural resource since 1998 will be the subsidies from England! 

Even more than oil
6979 2018-12-29 23:28:50 Can believe amazon ship 1 coconut oil inna big box
6980 2018-12-29 23:28:40 In the last 24 hrs there were a total of 2 oil product tankers in the ports of Quebec City and Montreal. Yet according to Quebec Premier François Legault, there is no social acceptability for oil in Quebec.

6985 2018-12-29 23:27:24 Me running errands is either:

Coconut oil in hair+ pjs under my jacket+ glasses to cover majority of my face 
OR
Full face done+ NYFW whooo bish I run dem shiz 
 
Literally NO in between
6986 2018-12-29 23:27:22 Ignoramus? Nice. You're the one shilling for Big Oil and pipelines. Maybe you haven't heard, it's 2019 in a few days...not 1929. #OilShill
6987 2018-12-29 23:27:20 The way UCF extrapolates their greatness is comical. We beat so and so, who beat so and so, who beat so and so...hey, we are National Champs! Pass the hemp oil. 
So, if LSU beats UCF, that means UF beat the national champs. Hey, that makes UF national champs!

6992 2018-12-29 23:27:02 Currently working with the original recipient of the oil pearl piece to make another and she's so sweet. That oil pearl piece was one of my absolute finest creations, I was sad to part with it, so it's nice to know it went to someone cool
6993 2018-12-29 23:27:00 If you are correct and renewables employ more people than the oil and gas industry it shows how inefficient it is   I believe that renewables account for around 15% of Canada’s energy.  I don’t like to talk right wing left wing it is dividing our country and I think it is sad.
6994 2018-12-29 23:26:55 One of the great legacies of Pres. Carter. It also dramatically lowered oil demand in the US under Reagan, who then got the benefit and credit
6995 2018-12-29 23:26:43 Under the boys on the bus are gone.  Nothing will change oil fans
6996 2018-12-29 23:26:41 Of what value is the measure "oil reserves" when global reserves exceed future demand? This is a maturing industry with participants trying not to have stranded assets - they engage in self-serving behaviour. This leads to overproduction. See Permian vis-a-vis takeaway capacity.
6997 2018-12-29 23:26:41 just saw someone say they are "working on a few designs" for print on demand sales and also an essential oil MLM so they won't have to have a day job anymore soon

7004 2018-12-29 23:25:59 Winter plays an attritional role as it did at Stalingrad of course- my point is that the Germans entered barbarossa with minimal resources, enough oil and supplies for a short sustained period of time, weeks. Winter is a moot point but it wasn’t the sole cause of their failure
7005 2018-12-29 23:25:52 I didn’t realize albertans owned the oil?
7006 2018-12-29 23:25:43 Chopped parsley with garlic in hot olive oil, add crushed tomatoes, salt, pepper, a tiny bit of sugar, the fastest best spaghetti sauce you ever made.

7012 2018-12-29 23:25:02 exactly. we need an oil dealer badly brother xD
7013 2018-12-29 23:24:30 Well there is absolutely nothing wrong with burning wood, I do it all the time without hesitation. I don’t burn chemicals or oil based stuff to the extent I can. The point I was trying to make with my comment was that the present situation is beyond repair (/2 continued).
7014 2018-12-29 23:24:21 And Yeshua and rabbis cook fish! Fish oil is non cooked so omega 3's are more potent
7015 2018-12-29 23:24:13 The good year logo reminded me I need an oil change
7016 2018-12-29 23:24:05 Feel the midnight oil.
7017 2018-12-29 23:23:58 Look at the size of that jacket! He could feed a tribe of cannibal's for several months. Lots of fat for oil as well.
7018 2018-12-29 23:23:57 old ppl put olive oil on fucking everything
7019 2018-12-29 23:23:51 The price of oil is falling quickly around US $ 45 mark.
It will fall to its TRUE value between 25-30$ per barrel

7025 2018-12-29 23:23:19 Excuse me, you shouted at Schumer in the Oval that you would take the mantle of the govt shutdown! This is the TRUMP SHUTDOWN!  You could end it by trying to be the great dealmaker you claimed to be during the campaign.  Glad I never bought that snake oil
7026 2018-12-29 23:23:07 And all the Oceanic people's lands are underthreat because of climate change, we'll see our homes lost forever, we see the extent of plastic pollution, radiation contimination, oil, noise pollution and the impact on sea creatures and us...

7032 2018-12-29 23:22:10 Democrats just blocked a rule preventing people with investments in oil companies from sitting on their house sub committee to address climate change.

Both parties are unfortunately pretty shit on the subject.
7033 2018-12-29 23:21:53 I can smell all your tea tree oil
7034 2018-12-29 23:21:29 i swear life is all about connections. I just went to get my oil changed at Valvoline and I know the manager so he gave me the best type of oil that usually is like $80 for $20. 
7035 2018-12-29 23:21:28 I think I enjoy giving my girl oil treatments more than she do
7036 2018-12-29 23:21:28 Deep Water Horizon some film!! Some catastrophe on that Oil rig
7037 2018-12-29 23:21:21 So Canada's Trudeau donates $6.5b to our dirty oil sands on one hand and Not one dime given to the electric or hydrogen future then imposes carbon tax on the his people.  This idiot has to GO. The hypocrisy is deafening.
7038 2018-12-29 23:21:20 hi mechanical twitter my car is smoking and burning oil super fast what’s wrong with it
7039 2018-12-29 23:21:05 @realDonaldTrump must divert the conversation away from his "story" and the oil leaking drip, drip, drip from the unfolding evidence that his "story" does, indeed, include collusion, lies, fraud, perjury, & "russians!"
7040 2018-12-29 23:21:05 That’s their god, gold oil and diamonds, let the scum have it, it’s not gonna make them live for ever.
7041 2018-12-29 23:20:53 Postmedia here in Vancouver is do in bed with the corrupt BC Libs and big oil it's almost embarrassing to even consider them as newspapers. I tend to filter out most media and believe very little

7044 2018-12-29 23:20:26 Trudeau providing zero real help Achieving getting our NR to market...I fear to say his hidden agenda is to kill oil...NR...Liberals going socialist big time...
7045 2018-12-29 23:20:24 Lol very true. I've found mice that have drowned in oil before and I can tell you it's very unpleasant
7046 2018-12-29 23:20:23 Albertans complain that Canada is not letting them get “their” oil to market. I’m interested to see how they plan to get “their” oil to market once they become an independent, land locked, country. Should be interesting.
7047 2018-12-29 23:20:19 That’s because you think he cares.  He never cared.  Its always been about him and most of us knew this from the start.  Don’t drink the snake oil, he is a phony and now with the economy going to shit, he will point the finger at someone else.
7048 2018-12-29 23:20:14 @zzzSaladin There's an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico at this very moment...;
7049 2018-12-29 23:20:12 got my african black soap and my jojoba oil skin boutta be glowin againnn
7050 2018-12-29 23:20:09 I cannot do perfume but like the aromatherapy line (bath oil, sugar scrubs, & rollerball) from @bathbodyworks. They aren't overpowering. My fav is Orange/Ginger (miss the discontinued sugar scrub). But Eucalyptus/spearmint, lavender/cedarwood & many others fit your description
7051 2018-12-29 23:20:04 Oil make me wish weed was legal in Georgia
7052 2018-12-29 23:20:02 Obviously overrated! That is still more than some can afford. Even here, with the oil boom rent for some became so outrageous, they moved into their cars. It’s heartbreaking. Yet.....
7053 2018-12-29 23:20:00 My dad doesn’t pay for my oil changes anymore and it makes me emo
7054 2018-12-29 23:19:31 Sorry to break it to you @TimRiskus but Trump is and has been lying to you and his supporters. He’s a con man who has sold his snake oil to the uninformed who hang onto his every word. So sorry you got swindled.
7055 2018-12-29 23:19:31 It was bad before the injuries, goaltending was hiding alot of warts, Chiarelli has to go prior to the deadline
7056 2018-12-29 23:19:24 I cooked one foreign spaghetti. It was thinner than the regular spag.
I added too much water and groundnut oil. I think my mind wasn't in the cooking of the food.
Came back spaghetti has turn to porridge.
7057 2018-12-29 23:19:22 Meanwhile I got my oil change and ready for uber and lyft specially tomorrow very busy due to texans game
7058 2018-12-29 23:19:10 みんなで油祭りしようよ。英訳するとオイルフェスティバル。
7059 2018-12-29 23:18:56 A chef taught me how to make a great spicy garlic sauce for pasta.  He said the fresh parsley at the end is critical because it cools the oil a little and prevents the garlic from burning.
7060 2018-12-29 23:18:40 meanwhile head north a bit to N Dakota where Heidi Heitkamp, who at least ran as a Democrat if a conservative one, outperformed both herself & Obama in Fargo, Grand Forks and the Native American reservations & lost mostly bc of oil money. Indiana: has more democrats & no oil
7061 2018-12-29 23:18:31 Hmm... The past *does* have greater oil reserves... And their defenses aren't nearly as advanced as ours!
7062 2018-12-29 23:18:03 A lot of us have made comment about the salaries the Oil pay out front, and how weak it leaves them from the blue line back.
Leafs are about to be in the same boat.
7063 2018-12-29 23:17:59 How can a husband strangle and dump the bodies of his wife and 2 daughters in the oil field!!!
7064 2018-12-29 23:17:52 Putting coconut oil on your face before washing it is really a game changer
7065 2018-12-29 23:17:45 Cotton in hot salt-water. Dab it on the area. And then apply a cream called Nadoxin. Works like a charm.
And for long term, try aloe vera+almond oil as a moisturiser. Or just aloe vera, like everyone says :p
7066 2018-12-29 23:17:38 Oil and salt. The kids are "trained" about water.
7067 2018-12-29 23:17:36 I see. I think it's about maintenance because my hair was falling out I had dyed it then put a sew in in it but then I started to use wild growth oil and coconut oil and it grew out drastically 
7068 2018-12-29 23:17:30 One more time: Put a strike price tariff on imported oil at $55 a barrel. Use the $ to cut our oil demand by 10%, thus world oil demand by 2.5%. Oil crashes to $20/bbl. Russia and Saudis collapse. You’re welcome.
7069 2018-12-29 23:17:25 24 hour has decent fries too... wen the oil fresh doe
7070 2018-12-29 23:17:15 I'm doing endless trays of baked veg to make into tasty salads. Each veg has a different marinade, but all has lots of oil.
7071 2018-12-29 23:17:14 Chef Skinner cut up some acne, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was veal, along with grass.
7072 2018-12-29 23:17:09 Coconut oil ,  black castor oil products ,
7073 2018-12-29 23:17:09 Exporting natural resources to world markets could help alleviate that impending wave. Especially oil, Gaz, wood, mining products....
7074 2018-12-29 23:17:06 @oil_shaeikh kaji yan legas
7075 2018-12-29 23:16:39 This game has some of the worst dog shit hockey I have seen the Oilers play all year. Coaching is not the problem, Chiarelli has royally fucked this team from cap mismanagement. He needs to be given his pink slip immediately, once we have injuries our depth is embarrassing.
7076 2018-12-29 23:16:34 Well my dad  - through his laughter - rightly Pointed out that at least I didn’t forget to put the oil in and drive away ;)
7077 2018-12-29 23:16:26 #Oil #SPX #Dax Riding bad horsies is dangerous on a flower field already. Should be even harder to handle on ice.
7078 2018-12-29 23:16:21 Mayonnaise is egg and oil anyways how is that bad in cake ?
7079 2018-12-29 23:16:21 I put some cinnamon oil in my diffuser and now my room smells like a michaels lksdjflsdk

7082 2018-12-29 23:16:04 I guess the driver stopped due to a red light? Imagine if it was green? 
7083 2018-12-29 23:16:02 Oil and Water 
7084 2018-12-29 23:15:58 Use moisturizer 

When rubbing lotion or oil into your hands, make sure you work it into the cuticles and nails, too.
7085 2018-12-29 23:15:56 try and stop me from drinking turpentine oil. 
sip sip bitch
7086 2018-12-29 23:15:55 Wild hair growth oil for moisture . Put it in leave in , shampoos, conditioners and moisturizers .
7087 2018-12-29 23:15:30 Cool. There’s a nearly $20 difference between WCS&WTI. Selling oil at $25ish a barrel is not a good business model. We produce 4.4million bpd but we can only ship 300,000 bpd. Our profit per barrel is basically nil. Global prices do matter since we have the cheapest oil on earth.
7088 2018-12-29 23:15:18 Super predators are not interested. What's stopping the Zionists from completely ruining Venezuela for its oil and gas? Millions are being starved in Yemen. Africans are under direct muscle of the US military in several locations. Greater Antilles  has oil and gas.  That's next.
7089 2018-12-29 23:15:16 Oil patch working Chad!! Hahahahaha
7090 2018-12-29 23:15:14 Why are the fans not littering the Ice. It is obvious the Oil need a time out. #LetsGoOilers
7091 2018-12-29 23:14:53 This is a dead country, i hope a handful of you leave, and the rest can rot in the swamp they built for themselves.
I can’t wait to see how you will all grovel once your precious oil runs out.
7092 2018-12-29 23:14:49 I had a look. Really good social aims... a small oil lamp was/is? it’s logo.
7093 2018-12-29 23:14:03 Canada Needs a Vibrant Agri Forestry Economy, Based on Agri Food Technology - NOT Oil and Gas !!
7094 2018-12-29 23:14:00 I usual just do water and coconut oil in a spray bottle. Wenatural has a good moisturizer spray that I use too but I think you have to buy it together with a set of other products

7097 2018-12-29 23:13:46 In case you haven’t noticed Middle Eastern Countries have cut oil production, yet our oil prices have continued to drop. Truth is a very small percentage of oil comes from that region. Assad and Russia don’t have our best interest at heart if you believe otherwise, we’ll then.
7098 2018-12-29 23:13:42 I w at to pour oil on u and rub it all over u

7100 2018-12-29 23:13:24 Considering some of the news coverage about Coal Solidarity people volunteer park-blocking public SuperChargers, it appears these chargers have a PR problem?Refinery and oil and coal workers are thinking that their jobs are going away, which is not actually true.
7101 2018-12-29 23:13:05 Saudi regime doing all kinds of makeover but consciously purposely not addressing central figure who caused it all MBS. This wouldn't work, as oil prices worsen, Saudi regime will come under financial pressure they will find world a less welcoming place!!!
7102 2018-12-29 23:12:54 If you were honest, the oil patch downturn happened before this government.
7103 2018-12-29 23:12:53 Lost our son John at 36 weeks (now 28 years ago.) Our open grief provided many space to grieve for their own unmourned losses. No one wants to be used by God this way (REALLY), but He brings beauty from ashes and gives the oil of joy for mourning. Father, glorify Your great name.

7106 2018-12-29 23:12:33 So you completely discount the fact the Oil outshot opponents by a wide margin because he wasn’t a fast skater? Seems shortsighted
7107 2018-12-29 23:12:24 Coconut oil
7108 2018-12-29 23:12:17 The lavender oil beside my bed knocks me out....EVERY TIME
7109 2018-12-29 23:12:13 Time to drive a truckload of money up to Yzermans door a la leafs to Babcock. I defended Chia for a long time 'round the water cooler at work.  But now it's obvious, Oil needs a GM that could build a speed game
7110 2018-12-29 23:12:06 Worst stock market month since the 1920s and oil lows will mean companies stop drilling will cost jobs. Losing trade war. Trump economy is a failure.
7111 2018-12-29 23:12:03 What a lifeless effort by the oil today
7112 2018-12-29 23:11:59 What's wrong with Canola oil?
7113 2018-12-29 23:11:57 Oil kings can beat them
7114 2018-12-29 23:11:45 I gotta get my hair done, buy brake pads, get my oil changed, and start buying more baby stuff .
7115 2018-12-29 23:11:36 Is the oil on the sweater, or just the smell?
7116 2018-12-29 23:11:34 I think the Cats changed their oil, too...
7117 2018-12-29 23:11:26 All of their own brand is palm oil free I believe
7118 2018-12-29 23:11:21 that yellow flower to make oil of it
7119 2018-12-29 23:11:15 They said all this with jade eggs in their pussies and 'chakra alining' jasmine essential oil on their pasty feet while writing about how to season tofu on their sad vegan food blog (tofu is raw with 2 splashes of soy sauce, for an "asian flavour kick")
7120 2018-12-29 23:11:06 ACDC for sure!  Men at Work close 2nd..lol  Midnight Oil's: "Beds are Burning"  is a one-hit wonder classic..

7122 2018-12-29 23:10:32 I do. It's much easier than oil/salt and it's a myth that soap damages the seasoning of the pan. When it needs to be cleaned that's what I do. Most times after cooking though all it needs is a rinse and a wipe down.

7127 2018-12-29 23:09:55 i decided to paint something with my oil pastels and i was like "oh im gonna do something simple to start" and now im painting for 2hours and not even near the end
7128 2018-12-29 23:09:44 Considering he's a big oil shill...we're against fracking and creating land that's worthless
7129 2018-12-29 23:09:40 Probably don’t even check the oil and water either
7130 2018-12-29 23:09:34 Honestly, they feel like they’re doing us favors.

7134 2018-12-29 23:09:08 The fact that you are comparing the same socio-economical model between these 2 countries without understanding how Venezuela anchored Evo as president using same militia strategy and money from Venezuela's oil is concerning....
7135 2018-12-29 23:09:01 Honestly no. Oh, I've needed to tighten a bolt or two, or like, remove the skid plate (4 bolts) to change to oil, but if 99% of the time you don't need full-size,  heavy-duty tools (if you do need them, call AAA)
7136 2018-12-29 23:08:56 Either there's oil in our pasta water or we're rinsing it. She's made one of those two mistakes.

7142 2018-12-29 23:07:31 Who was trying sell perfume oil to me the other day under that giveaway post? Please reach out
7143 2018-12-29 23:07:19 Wash the skillet and dry it thoroughly then wipe skillet with a light coating of cooking oil and you are good to go
7144 2018-12-29 23:07:16 Well this was announced by white house but still even most cynical estimates including your article will tell you that that US has significantly increased its crude oil production including 2 million bpd or about 20 percent only in last year ( this number taken from your link)
7145 2018-12-29 23:07:16 Alaskans own 442,097 shares of OIL & NATURAL GAS CORP LTD, worth $1,259,536. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in INDIA.
7146 2018-12-29 23:07:12 In December, Caracas and Moscow signed a $5 billion investment deal to raise Venezuela's oil production by one million barrels per day.
7147 2018-12-29 23:07:06 Did you throw a bucket of oil again?
7148 2018-12-29 23:07:06 @SOwenSons thanks for the prompt oil delivery #heat #hotwater
7149 2018-12-29 23:06:55 If you want to learn to think for yourself go look at those ideas & then ask yourself: 1) will they work 24 hrs/day? 2) can they be made/or exist WITHOUT oil? 3) How can they be implemented? 4) Will they supply energy to meet demand?  I can't help the brainwashed. Be educated.
7150 2018-12-29 23:06:55 Good Morning cold weather 
What's for breakfast? 

Spicy Spanish sardines in Olive oil,   Sinangag, crunchy dilis with kamatis, itlog na maalat & coffee with milk

7157 2018-12-29 23:05:57 Steak blue rare, baked potato (sour cream, bacon, and chives), garden salad (oil, and vinegar), and a big beautiful red to wash it down ... pecan pie with a side bowl of vanilla ice cream, and a double shot of espresso ...
7158 2018-12-29 23:05:56 2 years of blissful #ev driving with my #Tesla #modelx 25,000 miles without directly burning oil and polluting our environment. Feels strange now to think we used to have to stop at petrol stations @DMC_Ryan @InsideEVs

It’s call Royalties from oil & gas development
7162 2018-12-29 23:05:23 ...Military refunded-troops coming home from Syria- stock market records shattered -record low unemployment blacks, Latinos-record lowest unemployment 50y-FBI scandals exposed - energy independence at last, now exporters ng-40% reduction in cost of oil...

7165 2018-12-29 23:04:51 Aloe or coconut oil on your scalp before you go to bed, and rinse it in the morning. It won’t make your current hair thicker but it’ll strengthen the new growth 
7166 2018-12-29 23:04:49 invest in some makeup romivinv cloths and a good oil cleanser and stop using makeup wipes!!!!!
7167 2018-12-29 23:04:46 If I have eucalyptus oil rub it on your chest
7168 2018-12-29 23:04:31 MELKMAN DELIVERY!

However, 5-1 means the Oil are probably going to start taking runs at people. Keep your heads up. #sjsharks
7169 2018-12-29 23:04:26 Awesome little olive oil too?
7170 2018-12-29 23:04:24 @twila_oil  would you like to trade nude pics of each other or videos. I'm horny
7171 2018-12-29 23:04:03 Suzuki promised to stop travelling and use Skype yet he didn't. He owns 4 homes and co-owns an island with an oil tycoon. He doesn't practice what he preaches so he's a hypocrite who spews BS that his lemmings gobble up
7172 2018-12-29 23:04:01 Quebec has "social acceptance" issues with ALBERTA oil but warmly embraces Saudi oil #cdnpoli #abpoli #ableg #qcpoli
7173 2018-12-29 23:04:01 Duck Rillettes, Stage 2: the Confit happened today. I now have two roasted duck legs covered in the best-tasting olive oil in the world. I shall put that oil on *everything*.

7179 2018-12-29 23:03:02 Me vs throwing fries at a grill so the oil doesn’t pop me
7180 2018-12-29 23:03:02 My personal growth this year has been so noticeable and drastic to me that I’ve just been laughing at myself most of the year like “look at yo ass putting lavender oil in your beard being all extra and shit” 
7181 2018-12-29 23:03:00 Agree with everything you said but history suggests it’s never about making money with tight oil—it’s all about GETTING money.  There have always been good reasons why capital should stop flowing but it always has. Why will it be different now?
7182 2018-12-29 23:02:34 I Want to See Less:
1. Small tits. Please go back to the good old days of girls with huge tits. That's what made your site famous.
2. Oil. No more girls getting slathered down in oil.
3. Guys shaving. Men should have pubic hair.
4. Hairy bushes. Women should NOT have pubic hair.
7183 2018-12-29 23:02:23 No suntan oil, Nancy. It hurts the ocean sea life.

7191 2018-12-29 23:00:53 The new WorkHog® XT platform delivers maximum side-to-side stability plus superior cushioning and shock absorption. Loaded with comfort and durability, it's designed to withstand harsh outdoor work environments and oil and gas exploration. Available in steel toe and non steel!
7192 2018-12-29 23:00:45 Not up here. Oil-130$ , filters- 50$. That’s doing it in my driveway.  I usually do an oil additive every 2nd oil change(archoil or revx) And yes, I run a block heater when possible.
7193 2018-12-29 23:00:39 Man i took my car in for a oil change  now they telling me its $1,000 worth of shit wrong with my car. Man if you don't take this 80 dollars and go

7198 2018-12-29 22:59:59 Does UK elite support #GiletsJaunes in order to undermine Macron (so strengthen May) or to protect their interests in oil industry?
7199 2018-12-29 22:59:57 Oil diffuser and chill
7200 2018-12-29 22:59:54 When are people going to realize that’s the Oilers MO. It’s what they’ve been coached for 10+ years. Aside from McDavid, who drives the net.  Chiasson? Kassian? 

Players leave the Oil and have success in a different system.  Someone in the organization has enabled this system.
7201 2018-12-29 22:59:19 I will say Yes 
7202 2018-12-29 22:59:15 If you subtracted oil from the Middle East, the least important culture in the world is the Muslim culture.  If they were erased from the world, the only thing that would change is the world would be safer!
7203 2018-12-29 22:59:07 And that district has the largest free flowing oil well in the contiguous US in their boundary.
7204 2018-12-29 22:59:07 Thank you.I have won this recent 5 yr battle with depression. My arm will never be the same (scratching sections until they were bloody and raw)but physical scars are nothing compared to the unseen pain of depression. I found cbd oil. It helped me a lot along with therapy & meds.
7205 2018-12-29 22:59:03 Mass transit isn't subsidized?  How do you think products get on shelves for consumption?  We can argue this to eternity; electricity is sub, home heating oil, AC, food production.  Infrastructure is sub, that's how not-pure capitalist governments work, taxes sub infrastructure.
7206 2018-12-29 22:58:58 He's the only Apostle who never got martyred. They dropped him into a vat of boiling oil but God changed the nature of the oil. He said 'What a refreshing bath.'
7207 2018-12-29 22:58:56 お疲れ様でしたー
7208 2018-12-29 22:58:41 The peppermint oil diffuser put my ass to sleep last night LMAO
7209 2018-12-29 22:58:36 Bought a Groupon for an oil change so it’ll make myself get an oil change since it’s already paid for is this adulthood
7210 2018-12-29 22:58:18 look at the ass.  Put him a sideshow cause he's a snake oil salesman, a major major liar
7211 2018-12-29 22:58:11 What makes Vancouver fuel so expensive is the fact that much of the oil currently being shipped via KinderMorgan is going into the US and then refined in Cherry Point WA. and then sold back into Canada. Alberta chooses to ship bitumen rather than processed fuel to BC. Thank AB.
7212 2018-12-29 22:57:54 Panthers, Oil a close second.
7213 2018-12-29 22:57:36 The energy industry is moving towards renewables. This has nothing to do with the PM. Even when the oil industry picks up again they will automate more. They do that every single time. Even if we give the corporations exactly what they want, it won’t help Canadians who need work.
7214 2018-12-29 22:57:29 I have a great texture but it’s also thin, so I use the castor oil to get my hair thicker! And my hair doesn’t hold oil so it’s always dry so I do the treatments every two weeks.
7215 2018-12-29 22:57:25 2 hours to oil, moisturize and twist out my hair.
7216 2018-12-29 22:57:10 If you pay him enough free oil money he will stay!
7217 2018-12-29 22:56:41 Assuming Chia gets canned and by some late Christmas miracle the oil hire a GM who actually knows how to GM in the NHL in 2019, how long does it take this new GM to fix this mess?
7218 2018-12-29 22:56:27 Wow! That is a straight up #psychotic switch you made just their,.  a rational discussion is clearly NOT what you are looking for,. 

we are 7.7 billions of people,. #Oil will be depleted.  instead of wasting it, we need build sustainable systems for when it is gone. #degrowth
7219 2018-12-29 22:56:26 Oh shocker, Oil fans bitching about reffing.
7220 2018-12-29 22:56:23 Toner some by mi, sama face oil kleveru yg rice brand sama sunflower sama laneige lip sleeping mask. Sama 3 hr sekali kalo malem maskeran pake runa skin goldmask/charcoal. Udah itu aja wkwk. Sempet pake the ordinary niacinimide tapi ga cocok :(
7221 2018-12-29 22:56:22 Yeah those are like $75 oil changes! Do you run a block heater?
7222 2018-12-29 22:56:21 I got the fat back. So I keto started back today. The first week is tough. 

If you’re in need of a body flush, drink a couple table spoons of MCT oil, some cabbage and some broccoli.
7223 2018-12-29 22:55:51 Why?
Oil demand is increasing..

Eventually the planet will veer green but it’s a process

So until the day comes....
Still need oil
7224 2018-12-29 22:55:45 the fact that the guy at brake check thinks I’m crying because oil prices went up... lol if only that was the worst thing going on in my life 
7225 2018-12-29 22:55:39 Someone’s cat was randomly found stuck between our foundation and furnace oil tank fill pipe dead today now i feel bad but have no idea whose cat it was to let them know
7226 2018-12-29 22:55:37 —-Lips
•Exfoliate with a toothbrush for 30 seconds
•Put vaseline on your lips before going to sleep
•Mix 2 teaspoons of coconut oil and 1 teaspoon of vaseline and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon then put it in a container and mix it , it’ll plump your lips
7227 2018-12-29 22:55:25 It's rather insulting to willfully lie to the people of ontario. 
Perhaps you think we are stupid and uneducated to believe this!? ...oil prices and gas prices are low ALL OVER THE WORLD, because of cancelling cap & trade in one province. Give me a break.
7228 2018-12-29 22:54:44 Try using the dish soap Dawn they do use it on the animals with that had oil on them in the grease

Grey hair is preventable ... 
Vitamin E..
Fish daily..tuna works..fish oil.. ..B vitamins-
7230 2018-12-29 22:54:15 CBD Oil works for certain things in certain people. However we are in the gold rush stage of CBD production & testing so everyone is trying to get that money. Best way to make money is to cut purity or exaggerate the effectiveness of the product. That is clearly where CBD is now.
7231 2018-12-29 22:54:15 We ... phased out plastic bags we stopped New oil  exploration, we promised one billion trees ( better have natives in there ) we gave more money for conservation we have. Climate change minister  and more , we have made a good start & #CarryOnNZGreens
7232 2018-12-29 22:54:12 Thank the one for oil diffusers
7233 2018-12-29 22:54:07 Saw a Jaguar at the 10-minute oil change center lmao..
7234 2018-12-29 22:54:06 Try using the dish soap Dawn Dawn it worked getting all that grease and oil of the Ducks and different animals that live in the water just try it it might work
7235 2018-12-29 22:54:03 I am by no means a Liberal but even I can see oil is done in 20-30 years.
7236 2018-12-29 22:53:41 looks like we cant win with both right now, slippery slope down with no light at the end of the tunnel. so sad win a lot, then lost a lot and no consistency, no fight. poor hitchcock, left retirement for this shit show.  poor mcdavid, dria, and RNH. they should go on strike
7237 2018-12-29 22:53:40 You should be ashamed of yourself for repeating this nonsense. Ontario has never had a carbon tax. And plunging global oil prices are responsible for lower gas prices...all across the country. #onpoli
7238 2018-12-29 22:53:31 I went got a oil change yesterday and my car rides so much better...
7239 2018-12-29 22:53:29 Obama sucked. He tried and succeeded in keeping all job creators down with heavy regularions.Trump removed those and the ecconomy took off, jobs were once again available.He made it where oil companies can drill, now we are completely independent and biggest oil seller in world.
7240 2018-12-29 22:53:28 really don't think W was anything more than incompetent, which we all knew. And, he was being advised by Condi Rice, the prodigy with oil tankers named after her, but who made it clear a few weeks before the Iraq invasion that she had no idea the Sunnis and Shia had issues.
7241 2018-12-29 22:53:28 Man, how annoying. Annnnyway, I wanna talk to you about Kanola Oil.

7244 2018-12-29 22:53:17 You’re right, nothing has changed. Fly in fly out BC resident who drags Alberta and the oil industry but was happy to collect their paycheque from it all and spend it in BC. Let me know how that NDP/Green party works out for you. You’ll be begging AB for oil and a job in 2 years.
7245 2018-12-29 22:52:54 What’s the least essential oil?
7246 2018-12-29 22:52:53 I agree @mantalicious; however, my point remains that we simply don't have the ability to replace the current diesel systems with electric systems. I agree that driverless reduces redundancy and waste. We still need to operate both oil based processes and innovation together.
7247 2018-12-29 22:52:51 Things to leave in 2018:
Eating beef
Unsustainable palm oil
Ivory and exotic animal trade
Whaling
Fossil fuels
The human race
7248 2018-12-29 22:52:49 We have a secondary rule - if it has to have a logo then palm oil is absolutely verboten.
7249 2018-12-29 22:52:48 All but the hash for me! I do use CBD oil though.
7250 2018-12-29 22:52:46 It is government policy that has our oil landlocked   Which caused the value of our oil to drop to record lows. Should have been fixed by any one of the last 5 governments but all they did is put up more red tape.
7251 2018-12-29 22:52:40 When your policy has lined the oil barons pockets, and the planet is uninhabitable ....what then?
7252 2018-12-29 22:52:31 It wasn’t as bad as the time I forgot to put in the drain plug before adding the oil. That put things in perspective for me.
7253 2018-12-29 22:52:17 I need some damn coconut nut oil so bad  I gotta get some of that too while I’m out.
7254 2018-12-29 22:52:17 On the other hand, I am proud of Midnight Oil (tho not a fan) and Hugh Jackman because to me they more accurately represent Australia. But seeing (and feeling and understanding) your disappointment with your in-laws, I am also disappointed in myself too+
7255 2018-12-29 22:52:14 Sucks to be your friend. Probably should have gone to an Oil Kings game because this NHL team is a waste of time
7256 2018-12-29 22:52:01 Stop pushing snake oil. This is nonsense.
7257 2018-12-29 22:52:00 Toes & eye brows done! 
Oil change done!
7258 2018-12-29 22:51:59 You dont have the back of western Canadians. You are choking the oil and gas industry. Get Butts out of your office!
7259 2018-12-29 22:51:32 Very not friendly. But I did get a laugh imagining the censored versions. 
“The leather, to dill holes” 
“To LEGALIZED CBD OIL!”
7260 2018-12-29 22:51:24 We can clean and get the oil changed tomorrow
7261 2018-12-29 22:51:21 If your piercings have keloids, USE TEA TREE OIL IT REALLY WORKS

7264 2018-12-29 22:51:17 《オリーブ油の豆知識》

エキストラバージンオリーブオイルとはオリーブの果実を搾ってろ過しただけのバージンオイルです。
7265 2018-12-29 22:51:13 旨い……
7266 2018-12-29 22:51:13 Gun oil
7267 2018-12-29 22:51:12 do u wash ur hair with olive oil
7268 2018-12-29 22:51:08 Batter and oil. Nothing Special. Bit of corn meal and fine polenta
7269 2018-12-29 22:51:03 48時間振りに食べる固形物（おかゆ）は旨いか？
7270 2018-12-29 22:51:01 Thank you! Ugh. One of my pet peeves in life are modern day snake oil salesmen.
7271 2018-12-29 22:50:57 Huh. Now I want an oil painting of me staring pensively at my workstation screen while Jesus facepalms behind me.
7272 2018-12-29 22:50:32 So we know that say, schizophrenia is highly heritable just going off of twin data.

But poverty is also a predictor and potential agitator. 'Imbalance' also carries more normativity than I'd like, its like the bougie snake oil that is 'organic food'
7273 2018-12-29 22:50:27 Manna tasted like "honey and fresh oil" (Ex. 16:15; Num. 11:8). Manna was "angels food" (Ps. 78:24-25).  It tasted like nothing in Egypt. Manna -  "What is it?"  The world never produced anything as wonderful as THE BREAD OF LIFE.
7274 2018-12-29 22:50:20 African oil lang ako nik hahahahhaa
7275 2018-12-29 22:50:19 ねんむい
7276 2018-12-29 22:50:18 Many soups are enlivened by fresh chopped parsley. In the winter I like to add parsley to my salads. Actually I consider parsley as essential as olive oil or vinegar.
7277 2018-12-29 22:50:03 slow cooker and cover with water, plus about 2 inches. Add in ham bone, bacon or salt pork, if using. If you prefer a vegetarian or vegan method, use 2 tablespoons olive oil. Place the lid onto the slow cooker and cook for 8 hours on low setting.
Remove and discard ham bone,
7278 2018-12-29 22:50:00 Nope. You’re just mad  cuz you can’t defend that you voted for a fraud. You bought the Charlatan’s snake oil and that’s something BAB-O won’t take off. Heh-heh!
7279 2018-12-29 22:50:00 Estímulo fiscal a las empresas manufactureras: se lleva pregonando décadas. Venderlo como populismo: brillante.
7280 2018-12-29 22:49:59 off topic
Trudeau has a lot of balls.  He bails out our oil resources to the tune of $6.5+b. 
Has donated Nothing to electric or hydrogen energy.  And in the same breath imposes Carbon Tax on the people to pay for it.
I can not think of a hypocrisy so blatant in my life.  I'm 64.
7281 2018-12-29 22:49:51 Maybe oil should consider a Leon for Tyler trade with Dallas. Just saying #oilers
7282 2018-12-29 22:49:48 as if today wasn’t already shit, I came to get an oil change and they told me their prices on synthetic oil went up. FML.
7283 2018-12-29 22:49:27 WE MUST BUILD OUR ETHICAL PIPELINES—— no more bloody oil from unethical countries!
Canadians NEED JOBS!
7284 2018-12-29 22:49:21 You store oil/energy everyday. Its in the tank of your car and in the regularly paid electric bill (so they don't cut you off)
7285 2018-12-29 22:49:19 LOWER OIL PRICES = LOWER GAS PRICES.
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH CAP & TRADE. 
SINCE THE GAS PRICES ARE LOWER ALL OVER THE WORLD. 
STOP LYING TO THE PEOPLE OF ONTARIO..
7286 2018-12-29 22:49:14 No No No... It's simple America is not dependent of Syrian Oil. If you not willing to Pay for American Blood Shed on you Soil. Yes pull back. If your not going to give your people Civil Right we should pull back. This is what on there table
7287 2018-12-29 22:49:09 the first time i grew my hair out i used hair skin & nail vitamins & wild growth hair oil.
7288 2018-12-29 22:49:08 Don’t mind burning the midnight oil when my team wins.

7291 2018-12-29 22:49:00 Ladies you wanna fade stretch marks? It's Johnson's baby oil and  raw shea butter. Use the Johnson's baby oil during the day and the shea butter at night. You WILL see results. You're welcome.

7293 2018-12-29 22:48:51 It turns out that tea tree oil in the eye smarts a fair bit.
7294 2018-12-29 22:48:49 $74.00 for an oil change! Good Lawd!!!!! I’m about to learn how to change oil. YouTube where ya at!!!?
7295 2018-12-29 22:48:43 I really think the reason that they stay with him is that they don’t want to be exposed as the fools that hitched their wagon to a snake oil salesman.
7296 2018-12-29 22:48:32 salt and hot water.

7298 2018-12-29 22:48:01 Did the car oil change today. Seem to get quicker at it each time, at least!
7299 2018-12-29 22:47:55 1/ Energy is a matter of Physics. As Yamani said, the Stone Age didn't end because we ran out of stones & the Oil Age isn't ending for lack of oil (but rather for systemic lack of purchasing power to pay for it) 2/Gold backed credit kills the rest of the economy to save it
7300 2018-12-29 22:47:45 and mix them together and warm the oil, part your hair in sections and leave it in overnight and wash it out when you wanna style it. Every two weeks. You’ll see a difference after a month.
7301 2018-12-29 22:47:42 It can only be fair if the 17% applies to all industries that profit from public assets. So add mining, oil & gas, Politicians (they use our air) cattle and sheep stations on Crown land, Rottnest Island, Kings Park, Airports, etc etc. (Yes I am joking)
7302 2018-12-29 22:47:40 This reminds me of how some coaches brag about burning the midnight oil. 

“I was at the field house to 9 o’clock last night and got back here at five this morning.”
7303 2018-12-29 22:47:30 you do know Oil is a Finite Resource right?  
It will eventually run out.

how will we feed ourselves then?
7304 2018-12-29 22:47:21 ・・・推しリーシャデスネ ワカリマス!

7306 2018-12-29 22:46:56 also obsessed with facial oils, but I live in super dry Winnipeg. I use one with a base of hemp seed oil (but also a mix of jojoba and black seed oil)
7307 2018-12-29 22:46:11 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
7308 2018-12-29 22:46:10 I can't even begin to enjoy the level of anti-US sentiment you are directly responsible for throughout the entire world. Generations will pay for all your stupid, small words.
7309 2018-12-29 22:46:03 Arabic stores for the coconut oil. It comes in a blue bottle. They also have them in the Indian food markets! & get Jamaican castor oil. It comes in a black glass bottle.
7310 2018-12-29 22:46:02 This coconut oil is doing my hair good justice

7312 2018-12-29 22:45:38 @EdJoyHealth 
Hi Edward. It's Sonya Hale here Richard Hale's daughter - we met a few years ago regarding cancer advice. Unfortunately it had returned  but is in my bones this time. I'd love to chat particularly about cannabis oil. Please drop me a line. Thank you!
7313 2018-12-29 22:45:37 Delicious cooked on chicken breast covered with parmigiana soaked in olive oil wine mixture.  Or something like that...
7314 2018-12-29 22:45:28 Who needs oil, we can shove ourselves into a tent made from sticks and grass (until we figure out that we’re using too much, then we will shame the others for doing it) ...farts and love will be our heat. It just makes me smile thinking of it.
7315 2018-12-29 22:45:24 Blah blah...blah, yup, not true!! Oil will always be needed!!
7316 2018-12-29 22:45:24 The best.  Honestly, I hadn’t change my own oil in years, and I probably won’t again anytime soon. It’s always messier and more time-consuming than you think!
7317 2018-12-29 22:44:31 This is one of the worst games I’ve ever seen the oil play. Without Klef and russell we look like a novice team !
7318 2018-12-29 22:44:27 Right, without palm oil or I guess corn syrup, it separates.
7319 2018-12-29 22:44:11 @KristySwansonXO Gasoline is $1.84 per gallon here, where I live in Texas. How much is it there Kristy? Not in over 60 years has the United States controlled the oil market. Thanks, President Trump, for making us strong, economically. Jim.
7320 2018-12-29 22:44:01 Does $UWTI or $USOU work for the 3x oil long?
7321 2018-12-29 22:44:01 It took me 22 years to figure out cooking with olive oil is much better than cooking with butter.
7322 2018-12-29 22:43:58 We had no butter and it was Nigels days off work, so he wasn't gonna go to the store, and mom really wanted to make cookies.

So we made cookies with no butter, just vegetable oil. My advice: don't do that.
7323 2018-12-29 22:43:42 WVU gets $30m a year from tv. We get about 5. All that oil and gas money hasn’t done anything about a $20 million annual deficit in the athletic department. Dana might come, but it will be despite everything you list.
7324 2018-12-29 22:43:33 doing my makeup naked after drenching myself in body oil is really my favorite part of getting ready.
7325 2018-12-29 22:43:33 My bd deserves to slip in oil & get his ass beat by me with a belt  i can see it happening, ill beat the shit outta him

7329 2018-12-29 22:43:01 What happens when oil goes back up prices will go up as well regardless of a carbon tax
7330 2018-12-29 22:42:44 All those Yemeni children dying and you're talking about "Peace and Terrorism" 

Take the fking oil and leave
7331 2018-12-29 22:42:43 Yes, up until 2019 where the restructuring is now completed and distribution growth resumes.  Equity income needs growth to deliver double digit returns to compensate for equity risk.  MLPs have not grown distributions since the 2014 oil crash so have been unattractive. #Stocks
7332 2018-12-29 22:42:34 A lot of the skill sets are similar, actually. The oil people have been playing up the differences.
7333 2018-12-29 22:42:23 Lower oil prices = lower gas prices. 
This has NOTHING to do with cap & trade. 
We've got uneducated people or they just want the big oil companies to stay happy. That's the conservative way..
7334 2018-12-29 22:42:12 “This recipe is awful! I replaced all the sugar with beet pulp and the oil with more flour, and it tasted terrible.”
7335 2018-12-29 22:42:07 Thank u efficasent oil
7336 2018-12-29 22:41:46 This essential oil diffuser is a game changer. I’ve been sleeping so much better and it helps me breathe during the day.
7337 2018-12-29 22:41:46 Nice..wouldn't expect anything else from the Oil.
7338 2018-12-29 22:41:44 Ohh, cool....do a combo with the oil then 
You'll thank me lerra.... Let's see the result before the year runs out tho...lol

7343 2018-12-29 22:40:31 I haven't done an oil show in a while... Would any of ya be interested?
7344 2018-12-29 22:40:30 Goes to show that correct position sizing is paramount, although I will think twice again about investing in an oil company drilling out in the Russian ice 

You too Keya, always happy to share ideas 
7345 2018-12-29 22:40:21 So being a woman doesn’t qualify you for a woman’s march?  Are they aware that the majority of people in this country are in fact white?
7346 2018-12-29 22:40:20 I think Danjel called for an oil can.
7347 2018-12-29 22:40:10 Okay now you’re just purposefully being an idiot. I have already explained that it is basically impossible for an indivual to go oil free while still being apart of our society. The infrastructure for renewable energy is just not there. Ignore this again and I’ll just mute you
7348 2018-12-29 22:40:09 Karlsson is everywhere today. Would’ve been nice to see him on the Oil instead of the Sharks. Welp! Guess I’ll pay attention to my kids now. Nothing to see here @Isuckatpicking - insert

7353 2018-12-29 22:39:33 Them pushing this now means they have lost on every other front.

Identity politics blew up in their faces.
Immigration is losing favor.
Trump OWNS economy.

So environment is it.

Expect to see CNN/MSNBC pushing a shit ton of environment stories.
7354 2018-12-29 22:39:32 I use Nivea lotion,,, I do squats.. I’ll try vitamin E oil tho
7355 2018-12-29 22:39:32 The thing you put oil in and it sprays the scent
7356 2018-12-29 22:39:29 Good god when people found out I ACCIDENTALLY burned down a stove with oil they are gonna fear me cooking on their’s I fear myself
7357 2018-12-29 22:39:27 why cant you just start shifting everything to sustainable energy? why drilling for oil reserves and fucking up the entire planet with fossil fuel consumption? where are your advisers? specially those who are working on global warming issue? selling Pakistan to Exxon now?
7358 2018-12-29 22:39:23 ─ castor oil, is one of the best known natural products to grow eyelashes, eyebrows and hair. Its properties such as proteins, vitamins and omega 6 fats make it an ideal product to help your eyelashes grow long and strong.
7359 2018-12-29 22:39:11 But the oil paid for it.
7360 2018-12-29 22:38:59 They've already got diffuser oils that smell like baby powder! There's gotta be  an air fres.hener out there that smells like it too

PS, the oil is insanely pungent! After running it in the diffuser once, my room now eternally smells like a nursery 
7361 2018-12-29 22:38:56 I would prefer to know the facts of the award to Boing to deduce if it was a fair bid. There are others, like Lockheed Martin. As for the need, Putin has been zooming in on us in the North Arctic for a long while. IMO he wants Alaska to cut us off from N. Arctic oil.
7362 2018-12-29 22:38:47 They’re going to manufacture an oil crisis to get everyone distracted from the wealth extraction that’ll take place. 

It’s probably backlash for killing the pipelines
7363 2018-12-29 22:38:39 #Libya was announced to have recorded a decline in its revenue of oil and gas in November, reaching USD2.4 billion compared to its USD2.87 billion revenue in the previous month.
7364 2018-12-29 22:38:38 Use less salt and oil please.
7365 2018-12-29 22:38:35 Gets better and better! You guys are a wonderful generator of ideas! OK, boiling water on one fire, boiling oil on another and 2 packages of sugar within hand's reach. All set?
7366 2018-12-29 22:38:22 After 2012, foreign oil companies sold AB production facilities to purchasers that borrowed billions from Canada's financial businesses. Protecting those institutions from losses is one reason Trudeau Government committed more billions in fossil fuel subsidies. #cdnpoli
7367 2018-12-29 22:38:17 castor oil mixed with coconut oil. Thank me later babes
7368 2018-12-29 22:38:17 ROSEHIP OIL! It’s completely changed my skin, I literally can’t live without it.
7369 2018-12-29 22:38:02 Is that the same group of scientists who told us that we were slipping into an Ice Age back in the 70s.
Of course the conventional scientific wisdom then was that the oil would have run out and the world would starve by the end of the millennium. Science finds what you pay for.
7370 2018-12-29 22:38:01 Heck in South Dakota they use law-enforcement from all over the nation to stop peaceful praying people opposing pipelines in their only water supply byusing our tax dollars and police to defend that oil
7371 2018-12-29 22:37:51 my mom put this black tube in my bathroom and it says activated charcoal with fresh mint and coconut oil so I put it all over my face bc I thought it was a face mask. it started to burn so I looked at the tube again and turns out it’s actually black toothpaste

Because there was 'no inflation'. 

Someone forgot to tell my landlord, the Utility cos, the Oil cos, the food makers, etc...

7385 2018-12-29 22:36:36 I've got cornrows but my scalp is so dry. Torn between fitting chubby fingers filled with castor oil inbtw the rows and possibly spoiling the hair or patting my head every five minutes. 

Suggestions?
7386 2018-12-29 22:36:32 These breakfast capsules are dry-herb capsules without alcohol or oil  added. Alcohol and oil make thc much more available to body when it  is eaten as food. Some people have no thc effects from dry-herb  capsules and never will. Depends on individual person and strain of  weed.
7387 2018-12-29 22:36:24 Name one. If there was a solution the world would jump on it.  Nothing exists without hydrocarbons nothing. Shut down Canada & we have to import oil. It is seriously that simple. Please do your research.  Turning off the taps with no solution is insane.
7388 2018-12-29 22:36:13 Imagine the headlines if a Tea Party organizer canceled a rally back in '09 because too many black people signed up.
7389 2018-12-29 22:35:57 Yup, bleed Oil. Can’t switch teams now!

7391 2018-12-29 22:35:54 I’m using vitamin E, and tea tree oil on my hair to help it grow longer and healthier. Mainly for my scalp tho since it’s always dry
7392 2018-12-29 22:35:50 Exactly, forgot about the olive oil!!
7393 2018-12-29 22:35:46 Factually and historically bollocks.

Britain 1 of the first places to abandon slavery.
Nobody is against immigration with integration and contribution.

Most important: wealth wasn't stolen. Oil, diamonds etc weren't wealth in Africa. They didn't know it was there in most cases
7394 2018-12-29 22:35:46 My New Years resolution is to stop breaking my oil pan,
7395 2018-12-29 22:35:40 I've finished Nuln Oil before, never Agrax though and a use that a fair bit more

CBD: "Bet."
7397 2018-12-29 22:35:32 Go oil free yet? Or are you just all talk and no substance?
7398 2018-12-29 22:35:26 What?

You can make candles
Buy plots of land to grow your own food ( good luck in winter)
Horses can be your best friend..

Communication will be lost.. but hey... you’ll be oil free
7399 2018-12-29 22:35:25 Production volumes are still strong, all pipelines are all full and transportation rates are very high.  Oil prices in the $40-50 range will reduce the growth of US production but not result in an absolute decline.We expect MLPs to grow distributions by over 6% this year. #Stocks
7400 2018-12-29 22:35:24 Yeah I did the same, Butter, good olive oil ( to stop the butter burning) and flash it...
7401 2018-12-29 22:35:15 For the sake of Nigeria, hope crude oil does well in 2019...

Rub Nivea lotion and vitamin E oil on Dem ass cheeks
7403 2018-12-29 22:34:57 We kill orangutans for palm oil when there are multiple alternatives. Don’t think for a second an avocado consortium  wouldn’t extinguish the entire Amazon to grow that fruit.
7404 2018-12-29 22:34:57 They're called melomakárona. Traditional Greek Christmas sweets. Syrupy oven flour cookies. Flour, oil, some beer (alcoholic or non), orange juice and zest, cinnamon, clove etc. Dipped in spiced syrup when out the oven and then decorated. Really easy. 
7405 2018-12-29 22:34:55 It just needs more oil I’m sure it’s fine
7406 2018-12-29 22:34:41 Prepare for fuel scarcity at Christmas, oil marketers advice Nigerians – Business Times December 2014. #Flashback
7407 2018-12-29 22:34:40 All of those tourists covered with oil.
7408 2018-12-29 22:34:38 I really like Shea Moisture's Jamaican Black Castor Oil leave-in conditioner. Other than that, I hand make the products for my hair. If you're interested, I'll DM you the recipes.
7409 2018-12-29 22:34:36 Oh crap. This JUST happened to me over Thanksgiving! lol And ofc I have a Toyota which will just freak out bc of it. So, I had to have the radiator etc flushed and all new oil blah blah. $120 right. Before. Christmas. So awesome. lol
7410 2018-12-29 22:34:29 Buyout drops to $1 million after first of the year. Drop in the bucket for that oil money in Houston.
7411 2018-12-29 22:34:29 So I gather, although oil supporters in Alberta and environmentalists in B.C., appear to be equally upset with the Trudeau government, but, for opposite reasons on the same issues.
7412 2018-12-29 22:34:24 Got my oil changed and everything checked out, got a pedicure, and bought some underwear!  it was a pretty nice day today 
7413 2018-12-29 22:34:17 PT Christmas jobs don’t equate to full time, get our oil moving,will u be known as the PM who legalized pot, yet NO medical pot drs IN CANADA, were literally drinking #CBDOIL made w #PALMOIL . Only quality ingredients shld go into #CBDOIL , lot# clear to report these LPs.. #yyc
7414 2018-12-29 22:34:14 What I was told is the paintstiks are oil based so they don’t wipe off easily
7415 2018-12-29 22:34:10 The working class that build the 4+4 s the roads, the airports, staff the hospitals drill for oil and pick and process the food you eat, don't you just love the upper class who produce the square root of fck all. God bless and a merry Christmas
7416 2018-12-29 22:33:56 Again with this lie? Killing Cap & Trade has nothing to do with the winter blend being cheaper. Or current worldwide price of oil. What Killing Cap & Trade *will* do is cause the federal tax to be imposed. So that's actually just on you and Doug. #ONpoli
7417 2018-12-29 22:33:51 Migraine?
Not sure if it'll help, but deal with mine by putting analgesic oil on my temples & behind my ears, then ice pack on the base of my skull & another along the temple of whichever side the pain is most prevalent
And darkness
Hope it fucks off soon
7418 2018-12-29 22:33:47 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
7419 2018-12-29 22:33:41 Louisville forgot to put oil in their engines!
7420 2018-12-29 22:33:39 Orange& Eucalyptusoil in a diffuser is PURE BLISS.
7421 2018-12-29 22:33:14 What do you think about peppermint oil?
7422 2018-12-29 22:33:14 Level of cold: can’t smell olbas oil
7423 2018-12-29 22:33:11 @Shawhelp Reception issue on Sharks/Oil Game. @Sportsnet or Shaw problem?
7424 2018-12-29 22:32:56 @JWSpry funny how even with the oil sands your petro is twice that of the 
7425 2018-12-29 22:32:43 Use wild growth oil for your hair! If you’re not hip shit works so well
7426 2018-12-29 22:32:42 Finally got my oil I missed smoking my pen
7427 2018-12-29 22:32:39 Exactly, so that is why it is not zero-sum.  Economies continue growth creating opportunity and abundance.  Resources are limited and new ways are created to overcome limits leading to exploration and what you say.  i.e.: algae oil real time petro for heavy industry and is solar.
7428 2018-12-29 22:32:30 The 40 was lagging on power and there was no oil and umm I hope I didn’t blow my motor
7429 2018-12-29 22:32:29 Beating my dick blind folded while I spank myself with oil is a better use of my time than that
7430 2018-12-29 22:32:21 The last thing I'll say about Venezuela this year: Chávez made the poor poorer, the corrupt more corrupted, the oil dependance and extrativism stronger, racism and classism deeper, thanks to him divisions skyrocketed, I'll never rest until the last person I reach understands this
7431 2018-12-29 22:32:12 I don’t see why not. Worth a try. But you should probably still get an oil change 
7432 2018-12-29 22:32:06 i need a full body massage with some hot oil 
7433 2018-12-29 22:32:00 Is this.. baked in olive oil?
7434 2018-12-29 22:31:55 I hate prepoo’s period though  I use my coconut oil to remove my makeup and whiten my teeth!!!
7435 2018-12-29 22:31:51 ..하하ㅏ하
7436 2018-12-29 22:31:48 Hugely cheaper in United States. But US now near self sufficient. Imagine what could happen to NZ prices if exploration found huge field oil and gas!! But Ardern wants high fuel prices to 'transition' us from dependence oil and gas. Pls Ms Ardern we don't want to join Amish.
7437 2018-12-29 22:31:41 My cousin told me to use lard instead of oil for my cast iron skillet cuz it lasts longer.
7438 2018-12-29 22:31:35 Couldn’t make a deal if his life depended on it. He’s a charlatan and a snake oil salesman.

7441 2018-12-29 22:31:14 I've never spilled any bulb oil, spilt a shit load of plastic glue twice in the last three days though
7442 2018-12-29 22:31:13 Fuck oil already!
7443 2018-12-29 22:31:13 i have 4b hair.  shea moisture black castor oil leave in conditioner is great for moisture.
7444 2018-12-29 22:31:03 Here’s the thing kitten..

Alberta also has fantastic  agriculture 
( Alberta beef always in high demand)

Lumber and tourism amongst other things

We just know the importance of our oil industry... even if you dont
7445 2018-12-29 22:30:59 My bed smells like oil paint

I haven't even used oil paint 

I like it tho

Even though it's bad for your lungs
7446 2018-12-29 22:30:44 I have looked at them.  Thanks.  The production of the Tesla batteries is what’s leading us away from cobalt mining because of how advanced they’ve been able to concentrate cell density (seriously, look it up!) the footprint of electric cars is still much much better than oil.
7447 2018-12-29 22:30:37 I have a chainmail scrubber if I need it, use it mostly on my grill pan, but otherwise just wipe them down and coat them in oil.
7448 2018-12-29 22:30:36 にーておやあり！おぱよ！
7449 2018-12-29 22:30:29 If we are going to compare certainly it would be Egypt and South Africa who revitalised their economy during the fall of oil price especially Egypt. For Buhari, we are still lacking basic infrastructures and industrialization.
7450 2018-12-29 22:30:27 Oil play off the rush and perimeter all the time Mark. Driving the net and generating traffic not in their DNA. Watch San Jose, always a net presence and pucks directed there . This is embarrassing
7451 2018-12-29 22:30:22 If I had a consistent oil plug I’d cop but I always just “come up” on them niggas. Cool alternative
7452 2018-12-29 22:30:20 ゆきしゃんおやありーー おぱよーー！！！！
7453 2018-12-29 22:30:19 I’m not sure. I just know they stalled the oil mining that was supposed to start a few days ago
7454 2018-12-29 22:30:14 Isn't that big.
They gave him the money, the oil and than
they defeated him ?What kind of Logic is that ?
7455 2018-12-29 22:30:07 I just don't see how you can stop the brain from colliding around from the outside of the cranium when it is inside the cranium. With better insulation from the outside of the cranium. Cbd oil is better choice.
7456 2018-12-29 22:30:05 こうさんおやありでしたーー！！！！
7457 2018-12-29 22:29:53 Excedrine, lavender or peppermint  essential oil on your temples and a dark, quiet room
7458 2018-12-29 22:29:49 You guys might be up to something with these “oil changes” and “car checkups” my dad got me an oil change and my car doesn’t make weird noises anymore
7459 2018-12-29 22:29:48 君しゃんおやありーー！｡ﾟ(ﾟ´ｪ`ﾟ)ﾟ｡
7460 2018-12-29 22:29:47 It’s not the world oil price but rather the differential between WCS and WTI due to lack of egress. Feel free to check it out.
7461 2018-12-29 22:29:45 Andrew...  I know you’re a westerner and hate to see so many oil workers lose their livelihood. Problem is, oil needs to go. We have to work on developing sources of clean energy, not stay stuck in the mire of the tailing ponds.
7462 2018-12-29 22:29:43 I believe oil change is preventative maintenance to avoid future costly repair bills. Brake adjustments are the same.
7463 2018-12-29 22:29:42 Armani is 100% right.

Today I threw away my coffee. Drinking right now raw cacao powder + coconut oil. 

Plus sprayed my arms with transdermal magnesium. 

Anxiety vanishing. Focus and calmness going up.
7464 2018-12-29 22:29:18 Warm water, soap, soft sponge, dry it immediately, put a drop of oil on a paper towel and rub down the whole thing, then store in a cabinet
7465 2018-12-29 22:29:16 Tesla is noted for its electric cars but the most significant development may be in energy storage.  This will impact electric energy producers, oil producers and coal producers. Storing renewable energy has been the missing link.
7466 2018-12-29 22:29:08 I don’t know tbh I’ve just seen the oil
7467 2018-12-29 22:29:02 Oil’ blood. big money Titus 
7468 2018-12-29 22:28:44 Oil prices just fine...differential the issue

ただ、泥酔さん初め珊瑚礁さんたちキャッスルバニアを走られた方々、Rookさん、ヤポソンさんに初めてお会いしたにも関わらず温かく迎え入れて頂き感謝しかないです！

またオフイベあったら参加したいなぁ～
7470 2018-12-29 22:28:41 You misunderstand. If I watch a debate between two people on climate change - one is an eminent professor of climate science, published dozens of peer reviewed papers and the other has no relevant qualifications and works for a lobbying group funded by an oil company...

7475 2018-12-29 22:28:25 looking for dishes that call for truffle oil
7476 2018-12-29 22:28:24 So many white vegans tout their food as “cruelty free” without examining the human and environmental costs of mass-producing products like soy, quinoa, and palm oil for their consumption.
7477 2018-12-29 22:28:21 Peppermint essential oil on your temples.

May have some hurdles but completely doable...

You give up too easy.. you want oil free?.... start today
7479 2018-12-29 22:28:12 Made the boys some artichoke and pot-bellied pig and sesame oil mini pizzas with fresh green salad and homemade garlic oat dressing. Black Forest Gateau for dessert later...

But first? Watching #BicentennialMan in Roger's home theater!! hell ya
7480 2018-12-29 22:28:12 The oilsands emissions are capped and are constanly decreasing. But you are right they are higher than for conventional oil. And no where near as bad as for fracking. 
But that’s the red herring .
7481 2018-12-29 22:27:55 We need diversification. PC's didnot diversify the economy thats why we are suffering. Oil won't solve all our problems. We need new sources of revenue. And we can blame PM for everything but it won't help.
7482 2018-12-29 22:27:52 God fucking dammit, conservatives are idiots. If the infrastructure were there to live an oil free life in our society, I would 100% do it. But it’s not, because the infrastructure isn’t there

dry them out in the oven once every few months at like 400. turn it off, take it out, oil it, put it back in until cool
7487 2018-12-29 22:26:46 #SJSharks absolutely dominating the second here in Edmonton, outshooting the Oil Can 13-4 12:18 into the frame. 

No sag after taking a lead into first intermission. That's what you like to see
7488 2018-12-29 22:26:39 All anti Assad and Gaddafi as far as i can see. 
Yes the left is your enemy when America has a president who openly calls the middle easts oil "our oil"
7489 2018-12-29 22:26:37 Betcha the oil don't get a pp until 3 mins left In the game
7490 2018-12-29 22:26:34 The Haslams own the state.  Brother is Governor.  Nothing happens at UT w/o Jim Haslam saying so. Some of that power is finally being wrestled away.  But he’s presided over our complete destruction in football. 

The Haslams are good at one thing: oil.  And you can’t fuck up oil
7491 2018-12-29 22:26:31 트위터 사람들 모두가 춥다고 했는데 ㅠㅠ 심지어 서코는 음료가 언다고 했는데 안 들은 건 후냥 님입니다. 지퍼 잠그세요
7492 2018-12-29 22:26:26 Olive oil.
7493 2018-12-29 22:26:18 Need to protest like the French . Shut the whole country to a stop and strike. We are to divided here and that's what they like us fight each other and blame. It's a damn shame how the 1% been getting over through out history. Even using private contractors to protect the oil .
7494 2018-12-29 22:26:15 I think you have to have the puck to draw penalties but even then the Oil don’t get the calls.
7495 2018-12-29 22:26:11 She doesn't realize it was I who gave her everything she has--the grain, the new wine, the olive oil; I even gave her silver and gold. But she gave all my gifts to Baal. Hosea 2:8
7496 2018-12-29 22:25:51 Not to mention natural resources and whatever benefits derive from their use should be nonprofit and should not be owned or controlled by private individuals. They belong to the people. That includes water & natural gas, as well as oil.
7497 2018-12-29 22:25:35 와 진짜 여캐편파만 말하던가 추측성 비난은 또 뭘까 싶네요...그 말이 들어감으로써 문장의 신뢰도가 떨어지고...그라데이션 분노를 표현한 거면 ㅇㅈ
7498 2018-12-29 22:25:17 Since when does extreme =/= radical lol. The left does not look at antifa/SJWs favourably. Look at Shoeonhead, Hugo and Jake, etc. We despise them just as much.

Sure they have an impact much like evangelicals and oil companies do.
7499 2018-12-29 22:25:14 can’t wait to run my man a shower , and put oil all over the bathroom and start beating him w his belt
7500 2018-12-29 22:25:11 Still happens today in the same area over the oil pipeline.
7501 2018-12-29 22:25:09 The eligibility requirements are too stringent. We have a 20yr old oil boiler on its last legs. 1920s house, want a heat pump along with our electric car but house will never qualify to be A rated. It will be replaced with another dirty oil boiler unless requirements are relaxed.
7502 2018-12-29 22:24:43 Ooh, is this palm oil free too?

7508 2018-12-29 22:24:16 So you advocate for an oil free planet but are unwilling to do so yourself. Lol gotcha
7509 2018-12-29 22:24:15 bro I cook so much that now I can barely feel hot oil popping on me  it’s like a superpower

7518 2018-12-29 22:23:32 It seems like you are trying to please everyone - but the people who voted for you, and the people who want to see a sustainable future don't want separation or continued investment in oil.
7519 2018-12-29 22:23:31 She looks like an unpeeled banana dipped in oil.
7520 2018-12-29 22:23:27 The coal shipped to China is not subject to Carbon tax nor the oil imported from Saudi. Better to use our own oil and pipelines because we are cleaner and conscientious.
7521 2018-12-29 22:23:27 Their mother is a shameless prostitute and became pregnant in a shameful way. She said, 'I'll run after other lovers and sell myself to them for food and water, for clothing of wool and linen, and for olive oil and drinks.' Hosea 2:5
7522 2018-12-29 22:23:25 Of course there is - from those at the coal face. Port operators, border control, exporters, importers, farmers, manufacturers, Kent Council, the NHS. I suggest you start listening to them and ignore the the leave ‘snake oil’ salesmen.
7523 2018-12-29 22:23:22 If all those products would have to be made of alternative sources, more agriculture would be needed and probably more oil as well.

So the water needed to produce 1 pound of beef is actually over estimated because a good percentage of that water is used for those other products.
7524 2018-12-29 22:23:13 Wow Jen you sure do have energy markets figured out. You dont think the carbon tax will make gasoline more expensive? Oil is also at $45 usd which has negated the USDCAD move from 1.28->1.36
7525 2018-12-29 22:23:01 It’s by Farsali! It’s hit or miss with some people. It’s just an oil and people use it to moisturize or as a “priming” step. Any facial oil would work though.
7526 2018-12-29 22:22:58 Tbh I'm not that careful with my cars, but I've kept the oil changed. It's lowered and tuned but I've all the factory stuff.
7527 2018-12-29 22:22:54 Right? Isn’t the price of oil down globally.
7528 2018-12-29 22:22:36 Oil Sands Rebound in 2019: The Canadian oil industry could be in for another turbulent year in 2019… @environmentguru
7529 2018-12-29 22:22:32 This is the same assclown who apologizes to BP exec for his having to endure a congressional hearing after the killing of 11 deep water drillers and dumping 560,000 barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico. Which is worse?
7530 2018-12-29 22:22:30 Any type of oil can remove/break down the glue!
7531 2018-12-29 22:22:15 i made pasta with sauce  and meatless meatballs  and mixed vegetables with garlic and olive oil on the stove top thing .... i feel disgusting.
7532 2018-12-29 22:22:10 Not for money. Not for oil!
7533 2018-12-29 22:22:09 You are absolutely right. Money buys you freedom. Money buys almost anything. Money in the form of oil can buy you death of a journalist. President Trump is making money for all of the old wealthy family friends that he has.
7534 2018-12-29 22:21:52 I just bought a cool new Poo-Chi robot dog! George Washington was a robot powered by steam! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
7535 2018-12-29 22:21:49 The Turks were buying cheap Iraqi oil from them and giving them their only gateway to the world!
This is unbelievable.
7536 2018-12-29 22:21:47 @reeegii actually just paid for my oil change 
7537 2018-12-29 22:21:43 You sabi
Awon to oil money
7538 2018-12-29 22:21:33 The worlds oil supply will at most last until 2067. Kids born in 2001 who would turn 18 this coming year will know a world without oil before they retire.
7539 2018-12-29 22:21:18 Klopp had six (6) transfer windows and three (3) years of coaching to get his side where they are. City have spent a *billion* in oil/blood money. 

It sucks and it's frustrating but we're going to have to push through these bad days to get where they are.

7541 2018-12-29 22:21:09 Right 
7542 2018-12-29 22:21:04 Just wanna sip tea, watch Netflix while I plug in my oil diffuser
7543 2018-12-29 22:21:02 Scrappy Oil. Sharks bedre i alt.
7544 2018-12-29 22:20:55 Calm down my brother.
Health, wealth & prosperity cats have been selling this snake oil for years.
7545 2018-12-29 22:20:50 Using the shea moisture curl smoothie along with hot oil treatments  made a huuuuuge difference in my hair
7546 2018-12-29 22:20:50 와 글 차근차근 읽어보는데...예의바른 척 하면서 욕하네...편파가 진짜라고 쳐도 비판은 그렇게 하는 것이...아닙니다...
7547 2018-12-29 22:20:38 Norway didn’t spend the oil money buying pickups. They understand the oil era won’t last forever. Hopefully Alberta separates before the East has to pay for their shortsightedness.
7548 2018-12-29 22:20:36 The Oil's maestro slappin' some jams today.
7549 2018-12-29 22:20:32 If you’ve been watching Quantum of Solace on Rte this evening, I’d say it’s one of the best capable of of standing on its own. It seems like the poor relation in the series. But there’s a lot in there. Even a nod to EVs which is quaint and the whole oil/water issue.
7550 2018-12-29 22:20:24 You express like a robot. I guess you have been educated that way & any admission that science is on the wrong track & has been since the Nazis, scares you.
Nazis from Project Paperclip helped Rockefeller set up allopathic FORCED medication with the help of oil corp(se) $s
7551 2018-12-29 22:20:14 It’s essential in garlic and olive oil spaghetti, and don’t forget tabouleh, which is delicious.
7552 2018-12-29 22:20:11 Headlights 
Oil change 
Wipers 
All new fluids 
Cant beat doing rhings faster and cheaper myself
7553 2018-12-29 22:20:09 You’re always spot on sir. Houston is capital of the Oil & Gas industry () Lots of boosters. Tilman’s just the only one that speaks out publicly. The problem is the BS G5/P5 funding & path to the CFP “invitational”
7554 2018-12-29 22:20:04 C'mon... The price of oil has been tanking for 2 months now.  No need to misinterpret
7555 2018-12-29 22:19:41 Anybody use wild hair growth oil ?
7556 2018-12-29 22:19:28 Exactly. Yet most people I encounter who boost about the ‘cure all’ effect are smoking it. I know CBD oil has potential but this will never be recognised if people who are using it incorrectly are also promoting its benefit.
7557 2018-12-29 22:19:20 Mrs uzochi the oil worker, thanks lol
7558 2018-12-29 22:19:19 Also, f_ck the Oil.
7559 2018-12-29 22:19:19 i need brakes and a oil change 
7560 2018-12-29 22:19:18 Soak it in some used oil
7561 2018-12-29 22:19:12 Hahaha. My lamp will be lit because I have saved my oil and I am vigilant ;) Be prepared, my friend. One day at a time and with hopes for 365 such days in 2019.
7562 2018-12-29 22:19:10 “Alexa which essential oil will help me from being a crazy bitch?”
7563 2018-12-29 22:18:59 can’t wait to run my man a shower, pour oil on the floor, then beat him w/ a belt 
7564 2018-12-29 22:18:57 Since 45 whines so much about the southern border, Americans should forfeit their property, vacations and businesses in Mexico. *Mexico is the 7th largest oil producer and the USA purchases 50% of said oil.
7565 2018-12-29 22:18:56 君を揚げたいな…君を炒めたいな…君に僕を絡めたいな…僕は君のそんな存在になりたい。いや、既になってるだろう?
7566 2018-12-29 22:18:37 How do you mine lithium? How do you manufacture the vehicles? Answer to both....fossil fuels. Look at at lithium mine vs the reclaimed oil sands.
7567 2018-12-29 22:18:34 thank you so much for the compliment but even more, thank you robert for reminding me there are reasonable humans beings here. 
like oil, the truth will always rise to the top. spacey is just the tip of this ugly iceberg. happy healthy 2019 
7568 2018-12-29 22:18:34 Oil and gas industries receive almost all the energy subsidies and generate the largest downstream costs. $46B in Canada and $700B in the US.
7569 2018-12-29 22:18:20 American oil producers will slow down again because of the low prices. Russia wants more per barrel. OPEC will cut production to raise prices. Bottom Line: America spends insane amounts to keep the Strait of Hormuz open. Look where GM/VW/Hyundai are going.
7570 2018-12-29 22:18:14 I need to check the oil in my car. But I don’t want to incase it needs oil. #adulting
7571 2018-12-29 22:17:56 How is looking at where maxed out donations coming from oil & gas executives, as well as a voting record the sided with the GOP 'unreasonable attacks' exactly? Do you even know what story you are referring to? If so, can you debunk it?
7572 2018-12-29 22:17:56 @atiku@PeterObi@realFFK
They are being blackmailed by oil subsidy scam cases to play along. Dangote benefited from  PDP govts than anyone. He bought Texaco- renamed MRS. GEJ & NGOZI got $6Bn WorldBank loan for him.GEJ gave him GCFR, Femi got AP & renamed FORTE Oil, it's a shame.
7573 2018-12-29 22:17:47 if you know you know— I got my oil changed!! Lmao
7574 2018-12-29 22:17:38 Remind me of my friend, ran into a woman at the museum claiming that dinosaurs were just fakes made of black soldiers' bones and designed to sell more oil.

I'm not sure I can parse that one out with a whiteboard and marker.
7575 2018-12-29 22:17:31 "They spent years in Iran.
And the finally got back.
Had barely any food,
So I sent them some snacks.

Endless shots in Syria,
And that makes me so thankful.
Searching for oil,
To make all of our tanks full."
7576 2018-12-29 22:17:29 Try to store oil in your basement.

If only there were a way to consistently measure captured energy over time.

Hmm...
7577 2018-12-29 22:17:26 My face is in a frenzy so I went to sephora and got a mask  also got my hair some oil too so0o0o let's see how this all works out 
7578 2018-12-29 22:17:19 No one is claiming it is stopping emissions on its own (but it has caused them to grow relatively slower than the would have). The previous provincial government aggressively pursuing fracking/oil+gas extraction is a different and separate issue.
7579 2018-12-29 22:17:19 $40 oil
7580 2018-12-29 22:17:17 some girl at work just said “mom i farted and oil came out” wtf i can’t do this anymore
7581 2018-12-29 22:17:16 Spam oil
7582 2018-12-29 22:17:08 But not necessarily means that oil will depreciate as a commodity in the near future.
Giving that beside Saudi Arabia and other countries that shift to "cleaner" sources of energy, the other part of this world still depend on oil...

7588 2018-12-29 22:16:31 I feel like you could go anywhere for a diagnostic for hella cheap but idk that much about cars. My service light just came on so I’m taking it in. They want 120 but it includes the oil change

7591 2018-12-29 22:16:08 Trump administration could buy up the soybeans, store them with the strategic oil reserve.
7592 2018-12-29 22:16:08 With oil revenue down so much, the #KillerPrince needs another shakedown of the #CrookedSaudiRoyals. More sales for Ritz #Riyadh. @RitzCarlton #SaudiBarbaria

7598 2018-12-29 22:15:35 Thing about climate change deniers is what their view about oil as energy source.
7599 2018-12-29 22:15:32 1)YPF compra Oil Combustibles, la petrolera de Cristóbal López

2) a cuanto las vendió ????
7600 2018-12-29 22:15:30 Cage plays a caveman who survives the collapse of the World Trade Center and helps Louisiana recover from the BP oil spill. In the end, he is killed by the Imperial guard of China. Kathleen Turner costars.
7601 2018-12-29 22:15:16 Yea I was just having that conversation with someone who’s been running around Seattle for 6 years saying I stole their longboard but doesn’t mention the part how he stole an ounce of weed from me he was supposed to make oil for me with or how they stole a pound of trim in a tube
7602 2018-12-29 22:15:11 Crude oil, 10 ticks is the rotation. #forex
7603 2018-12-29 22:15:11 Oil dy your head
7604 2018-12-29 22:15:04 Time to get out of bed with the oil & gas industry and start putting people and our planet first! #banfrackingnow
7605 2018-12-29 22:15:01 I would much prefer the #CPP get my savings out of oil and for profit prisons. #divest.
7606 2018-12-29 22:14:51 I agree with most of that. I support pipelines and being better stewards of the earth. One reason why I'd rather see more oil and gas produced in Canada than other jurisdictions until we are using alternative sources or we are much more energy efficient with O&G
7607 2018-12-29 22:14:40 I’m gonna start taking fish oil and other supplements (partially bc I’m worried about my h*ir th*nning) but anyway I guess I’m not a ~*true*~ vegetarian anymore ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
7608 2018-12-29 22:14:38 Uh.... Coconut oil works perfectly for my skin, actually. Like I wouldn’t trade it for anything else and love to add a few drops to my skin care products. 

Just because it didn’t work for some doesn’t mean it doesn’t work for others.

7610 2018-12-29 22:14:19 He’s probably never even heard of an oil change.

7615 2018-12-29 22:13:31 With all the positive reports about CBD, why is it still so hard to market it?  Why is everyone still so afraid of this natural, non THC, hemp oil?  We at Medicinal Essentials want everyone to share the good news about our product.
7616 2018-12-29 22:13:28 PEOPLE SLEEP ON CARROT OIL!! It helped my hair flourish like crazy.
7617 2018-12-29 22:13:22 YOU CANT RETWEET BOTH COUPZI AND Hellman's (With Extra Virgin) Olive Oil MAYONNAISE Dressing!!!!! youre greedy and thats too much power!!!!!!!!!! >:(
7618 2018-12-29 22:13:18 So you’ll be going oil free when? Lol, thinks my reply is stupid, thinks the government should fix everything.....been to the hospital lately? Can’t come up with any of his own solutions, just another beta with fast thumbs
7619 2018-12-29 22:13:16 1st off glad 2 discuss about what U have stated re: Islam- is grossly exaggerated & what bothers me most re: what U stated is if so easily solved politically why for 60+ years are policies enacted backed only by WAR, MIC, IMF, WTO, OIL? quit conflating Islam w/Govts Actions
7620 2018-12-29 22:13:16 "If Alberta wanted their economy to flourish, they would realize that oil is a finite industry". My god this is dumb...
7621 2018-12-29 22:13:13 You think this kid actually knows to change his oil?
7622 2018-12-29 22:13:09 Remind me to never put olive oil on my face ever again
7623 2018-12-29 22:12:56 You people telling me to bring palm oil and yam and garri, you don’t have village abi? Or am I a joke to you?
7624 2018-12-29 22:12:50 Thanks! Its a piece of purple heart that I picked up. I'm hoping once I oil it the grain and color really pop out. They're a pretty awesome tool to get into! It's roughly as complicated to do as 3d printing, just also need to know tools in addition to materials.

7629 2018-12-29 22:12:05 They burden will be felt most by poor minorities and they will be told to cheer the misery in the name of saving the planet. 

The Left doesn't want the third world to have their industrial revolution. Much easier to control them whilst in poverty.

7631 2018-12-29 22:11:48 @BeyondMeat it’s too bad you use sunflower oil in your Beyond Burger. People have severe allergies to sunflowers (& the entire Asteraceae/Compositae family) & can’t eat this. True in my household. Would love to see you switch the sunflower oil out for something else.
7632 2018-12-29 22:11:45 Is snake oil used as a block chain lubricant?....asking for a friend
7633 2018-12-29 22:11:41 Right so when you see a fossil fuel executive backing a specific report or a politician that mostly gets kick backs from oil they're woke

You realize that even NASA and Trump's own administration concur yea?

Big oof
7634 2018-12-29 22:11:09 Oil Burnie my favourite player
7635 2018-12-29 22:11:07 It’s not oil production that increases GHG’s. 
It’s the combustion of that oil. 
Unless we stop burning fossil fuels atmospheric CO2 will increase. 
Production and transport of oils is a simplistic red herring.
7636 2018-12-29 22:10:58 Or if feeling risque a good chipping and plunged into hot oil 
7637 2018-12-29 22:10:47 Do I think we will be completely not using oil? No. Why? People like you.
Oil vs Renewable resource such as solar, will be vastly greater for renewables.  Just look at how fast companies such as Tesla are growing.  You’re fading away.
7638 2018-12-29 22:10:40 Wind, water, solar. Theres a ridiculous amount of option out there. But Conservatives are too stubborn to listen. Imagine if Alberta revolutionized their economy by putting all of their oil funds towards wind turbines?? Jobs galore, and less risk of other counties dictating price
7639 2018-12-29 22:10:39 Hemp seed oil has a higher protein content than raw meat or fish.
7640 2018-12-29 22:10:36 That’s because oil is trapped due to insufficient pipe egress (pipelines promised but cancelled due to rules changed halfway through the permitting process)
7641 2018-12-29 22:10:29 Bout to grab you a Muslim oil my boy lol
7642 2018-12-29 22:10:23 I’m in oil and gas an I sure don’t feel confident nor do I feel confident in your government.

7648 2018-12-29 22:09:39 Let me guess,the authors of this BS/Lie are Eastern Liberal Elites whith no clue about Alberta,the oil industry or our disdain for a PM who has publicly insulted us, tells us he prefers Quebecers and hates the oil/gas industry!This article is #FakeNews
7649 2018-12-29 22:09:32 Anybody I know do oil painting? Does it smell so bad that you wouldn’t recommend doing it in an RV? Asking for myself 
7650 2018-12-29 22:09:20 Oil buddies baya ta ha

7652 2018-12-29 22:09:12 Joe didn't work the first 3 years we were together, so I supported us both, now that we've been broken up 2 years he just randomly buys me shit.  Like I mentioned I needed an oil change once and he transferred me $100 for it.
7653 2018-12-29 22:08:58 Dropped car off at 2:45 for oil change.... still not done 
7654 2018-12-29 22:08:45 this rose oil got me feeling pretty
7655 2018-12-29 22:08:41 You think we won’t using oil in a 100 years....I’ll bet we are
7656 2018-12-29 22:08:40 The last guy who should have access to taxpayer money is the snake oil salesman who claimed bankruptcy multiple times.  Like Kellyanne Conway used to say “Trump built his business and wealth off the backs of the little people”.
7657 2018-12-29 22:08:35 Keep up the good work. Oh ya and see you can get oil to tidewater!  Thanks 
7658 2018-12-29 22:08:29 Evil little bastards just want to make money through genocide!  Which makes America the bad guy Russia's worked so hard to portray...  But they need the US to buy their oil, and sell no green energy..  Getting close to being cornered into world war three!
7659 2018-12-29 22:08:24 Yes, but the 1970s oil crisis led to surge in people buying smaller, more-fuel efficient cars. Yes, a wholesale social change is needed, but everyone has a role to play. Lowering the de facto subsidies we pay to SUV commuters through artificially cheap fuel is part of it.
7660 2018-12-29 22:08:23 Lavender oil has literally changed my life
7661 2018-12-29 22:08:19 それは素晴らしい！！
7662 2018-12-29 22:08:17 That oil pen be hittin different
7663 2018-12-29 22:08:04 I tossed them in olive oil, garlic powder, onion powder, and BLACK TRUFFLE SALT!! Cooked em on 375 for 20-25 min and then broiled em for like... 5-7 min? Depending on how they look.
7664 2018-12-29 22:07:56 I got an oil diffuser for Christmas. I went to add water to it today and I found a spider that had crawled into it and drowned.
7665 2018-12-29 22:07:53 Including no suggestions on how to solve Alberta's problem in getting its oil to market..... c'mon Mr Angus; I would of expected this kind of rhetoric from Mr Scheer's Conservatives
7666 2018-12-29 22:07:49 Are @IcelandFoods going to answer whether or not their vegan range is palm oil free??? I can’t get an answer out of them

7668 2018-12-29 22:07:35 Don't eliminate insurance-just make Coal, Gas & Oil pay for what they've created-adjust the premiums to fit the damage(s)...
7669 2018-12-29 22:07:29 Lol I have seen Conservatives blame Notley and Trudeau for the oil price crash. 
If I knew others were too blind to see those comments, I would have SSed them.
7670 2018-12-29 22:07:18 This means that Clean Air Act controls over GHG emissions from oil/gas extraction/production is the sole venue & field for action.   That means defending President Obama's CAA regs controlling methane release from extraction and Clean Power Plan controls on electric pwr industry.
7671 2018-12-29 22:07:17 What’s replacing oil????????
7672 2018-12-29 22:06:59 Lol i saw it on media nah
7673 2018-12-29 22:06:33 Sounds good, lead by example, remove everything manufactured with oil and report back. I assume by smoke signal but that’s fine, I’ll keep an eye out.
7674 2018-12-29 22:06:03 And yet he’s Gay himself.   
Don’t mistake expanding the oil sands for not being environmentally conscious.  If you really think bringing it in from the saudis, Venezuela, Iran or Iraq is more environmentally friendly, you really aren’t looking at things realistically.
7675 2018-12-29 22:06:01 الله يجزاك خير
7676 2018-12-29 22:06:01 @sjmuir and @Resource_Works are lobbyists for Big Oil. 

Oil prices are down globally including oil from the United States. You don’t make up revenues from low oil prices by the increasing production. Even YOU supported reducing production.
7677 2018-12-29 22:05:38 I was in school and attended inaugration programme of Indian oil refinery in panipat.
7678 2018-12-29 22:05:35 Except people in oil industry you and Gerald are making sure it goes down the crapper
7679 2018-12-29 22:05:30 Well we got some consistency from the Oil now. Going for 5 straight losses. Way to go boys.
7680 2018-12-29 22:05:29 Lol okay buddy, truly showing your ignorance here. Keep supporting a dying economy. I wonder how Alberta will try and blame it on everyone else when the oil market suffers yet another crash
7681 2018-12-29 22:05:23 Lizzo - Worship (Coconut Oil)

7683 2018-12-29 22:05:13 Pls talk na 
7684 2018-12-29 22:04:53 You really think this legislation won’t be altered before 2040? Just a dream as politicians change all and Norway can sell oil freely as multiple pipelines to EV’s!
7685 2018-12-29 22:04:49 Funny story. I actually did work in the Alberta oil patch for ten years. All this bitchin was the same back then. Nothing has changed.
7686 2018-12-29 22:04:34 Last night my dad was fucking around in the kitchen attempting to bake bread. He's complaining that it's sticking to the pan.

Me trying to be helpful: try using oil or butter on pan

Mom and dad to sister: the fuck does he know about baking bread?
7687 2018-12-29 22:04:28 Grab an Avitas oil cartridge today while you're out and about!
7688 2018-12-29 22:04:13 Also I’ll recommend products from Arami essentials on IG, the oil is doing wonders for my skin.
7689 2018-12-29 22:03:54 Ya maybe in another 100 years....until then we still still need and reply on oil.
7690 2018-12-29 22:03:48 Addressing climate change can only be addressed by greenhouse gas emission reductions & preserving terrestrial carbon sinks.  Hydraulic fracturing operation operations don't release GHG under high pressure injection, but all other parts of oil/gas extraction/production do so.
7691 2018-12-29 22:03:30 the tourists here in st lucia are putting “authentic” coconut oil on their faces i’m screaming

7693 2018-12-29 22:03:07 i think a lot of white people in NA are afraid to go into small stores run by other cultures. Here in Vancouver, not so much. The prices can be a lot better too... got some 3 ingredient (banana, sugar, coconut oil) Philippine banana chips for $2 yesterday vs $5-6 atsuperarkets

7696 2018-12-29 22:02:47 To plump up lips, apply peppermint oil.
7697 2018-12-29 22:02:46 I made empanadas and while they were rly good, i feel like i stink of cooking oil 
7698 2018-12-29 22:02:42 To the farmers who bought trump’s snake oil... 
7699 2018-12-29 22:02:24 Relying on oil is idiotic. If Alberta wanted their economy to flourish, they would realize that oil is a finite industry that is coming to its end
7700 2018-12-29 22:02:23 Ok 
7701 2018-12-29 22:02:19 Who’s taking oil money in office? Who’s stopping a green new deal? Let’s read and write, research and spotlight things
7702 2018-12-29 22:02:15 So are you going to take credit when they spike back to 2014 pricing, or will you ignore the high jump is gas carbon has zero to do with it price of oil is and has dropped around the world Alberta has a carbon tax, and their gas is cheaper than Ontario #onpoli #ConJobForThePeople
7703 2018-12-29 22:02:13 How does throwing good dollars after bad at the oil & gas industry help 'everyone' succeed? It doesn't. All it does is exacerbate climate change and increase the odds we won't succeed, as the economy as we understand it fails due to increasing extreme weather events.
7704 2018-12-29 22:01:57 SELF-CONTROL WOULD OF COURSE CALLED A GIRAFFE. TIME TO CALCULATE BLUE, BIRD SEEDS BONUS. BAM. ACCEPTS THAT HE LOTION BARF ON YOUR HAVE BURPED. PEE CARDS. SOME GRAPE GANG, DID ANY OF TURDS FOR CHEESE RON ENGRISH COW PEE OLIVE OIL LISTENING TO THE SILENCE NOT TO APPROACH

7709 2018-12-29 22:01:29 My 2019 New Years goals:
Learn a new skill
Drink a lot less 
Atleast 20 mins of cardio Mon-Fri 
Make 50k by the time the year is over 
Get an oil change every 4 months

7712 2018-12-29 22:01:24 Of course we have bigger fish to fry & I got the peanut oil ready. But I'm not bypassing that or anything they do. And yes freedom of speech, but understand there are consequences & people have to take ownership of what they say & do.
7713 2018-12-29 22:01:20 Egg Salad Sub on Italian 5 grain, toasted, with yellow American, banana peppers, oil & vinegar, spicy mustard, guacamole, and bacon
7714 2018-12-29 22:01:19 No. I whipped off the torque regulator covered, cleaned up an oil leak, put the cover back on and we had two engines again. As I say, an absolute fluke.
7715 2018-12-29 22:01:03 I'm no economics major...but...

You know what would make it even lower?

Building pipelines to get Alberta oil to foreign markets.
7716 2018-12-29 22:00:56 Anyway I hope Australia stays our of your oil wars as our soldiers and RAAF don't need the drama I say. It's not our war and I heard yesterdsy Trump canned the Anzus treaty so fingers crossed our side finally comes home. Iraq was so long ago and we know unnecessary now sorry
7717 2018-12-29 22:00:54 I think my favorite feeling is rubbing coconut oil all over my body and feeling so so soft & coconutty, like a tropical goddess dipped in sunshine 
7718 2018-12-29 22:00:53 Word is Alberta is switching to soybeans and building massive greenhouses over the now defunct oil sands
7719 2018-12-29 22:00:53 My go to food is roasted non salted peanuts. I carry several bottles on my frequent trips to China. In Asia, it is hard to find peanuts not cooked in oil. It is a great protein.
7720 2018-12-29 22:00:52 Wait that means no Time Man or Oil Man cards, doesn't it?
7721 2018-12-29 22:00:51 Who can afford Tesla cars
How long does it take to charge
How cool that it doesn't need oil changes or brake pads.  Why doesn't it need brake pads?
7722 2018-12-29 22:00:33 Let me know how it works. I've done all mine with mineral oil,  I just did 3 more for Christmas gifts and used a shellac on the bark for the first time
7723 2018-12-29 22:00:29 @HeritageToyotaC  it is not that I have to wait for almost two hours for an oil change.  It is that I have not heard about the status of my car for two hours.
7724 2018-12-29 22:00:26 おーっす！はよー！今日も頑張ろーぜ！
7725 2018-12-29 22:00:22 December 29, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
7726 2018-12-29 22:00:12 I hear there is that lipstick that is only removable with oil
7727 2018-12-29 22:00:10 My taste in food is vanilla.

If I had to eat one food every day for the rest of my life, it would be pizza. 
Next up: lasagna, wings, Vanilla shakes. 

After tweeting that, I feel like I am pouring motor oil into my blood.
7728 2018-12-29 22:00:10 He should focus on healthcare, pensions, education, and promoting ways how he will deal with the dying oil industry. Instead he’ll give oil workers extra tax dollars because for sure they’ll be jobless soon, and throw more money at pipelines when nobody wants the oil.
7729 2018-12-29 22:00:02 I’m in one of those “stay in your car” oil change places and I’m next... I also have to pee like never before, yet I’m so thirsty for the giant water bottle next to me 
7730 2018-12-29 21:59:58 unfortunately - sometimes - give it an oil to avoid it in future. ..
7731 2018-12-29 21:59:35 Night use.

If your skin is ashy, you can try using glow oil or any other body oil in the morning.
7732 2018-12-29 21:58:47 Seeing a pro oil commercial sponsored by the province of Alberta on a national broadcast seems unseemly.
7733 2018-12-29 21:58:41 I love peanut butter (palm oil free of course ) I put a teaspoon of it in my protein shakes for after the gym.
7734 2018-12-29 21:58:14 Imagine dying because of peanut oil  I’d be pissed off
7735 2018-12-29 21:58:09 With the price of oil at near record lows, one can only assume that the oil companies, that also refine are making up for low oil prices by charging more for gasoline and diesel.
7736 2018-12-29 21:57:56 Yahoo yahoo after crude oil lol
7737 2018-12-29 21:57:51 Hang in their dear. Call a friend. Can you get CBD oil and ointment or some krantom may help for Time being. What about your  primary till you get to see the other Dr. How could he ignore this. My heart goes out to you

7741 2018-12-29 21:57:26 Fuck I miss carabas and their awesome bread with oil and drinking their sangria 
7742 2018-12-29 21:57:26 #The Health Benefits Of Fish Oil Are Many, But Bear in Mind, Not All Formulas Are Made Equal  #article 103394 @netdatabiz
7743 2018-12-29 21:57:20 The oil splashes abeg. I'm not doing
7744 2018-12-29 21:57:20 The argument for mining, gas and oil jobs is becoming harder to sustain. Rio Tinto etc are all automating their mine sites and transport networks. There won't be any net benefits from these projects for the Australian population now or in the future.
7745 2018-12-29 21:57:09 i used to go to school with tea tree oil on my face i bet it’s why everyone stayed away from me
7746 2018-12-29 21:56:53 We had a @repeal_shield for the bots in our abortion referendum here in Ireland , that you could block them and saved you having to listen to them. 
We need one that blocks oil company bots who are paid full time to be on here peddling lies, for their employers.
7747 2018-12-29 21:56:50 Isnt oil already bad for the body?
7748 2018-12-29 21:56:38 My grandma did too. Oil of Olay also.
7749 2018-12-29 21:56:31 Enough with your pie in the sky bs Bernie. Either you actually DO something or STFU. You have spent your entire career blowing smoke up the collective populous ass. Pass some legislation THEN come talk about what you want to do, until then you are just selling snake oil.
7750 2018-12-29 21:56:11 I don’t trust Russia at all about Manbij and expect them to green light Turkey occupying all of Rojava’s currently controlled territory. All about balance in Moscow’s thinking, give Turkey half of Syria, don’t let Iran have too much influence. Deir Ezzor oil fields might
7751 2018-12-29 21:56:06 Yow bayil nonou rek !!! Outal sa karite ak sa bi oil topal limala wakh rk 
7752 2018-12-29 21:55:59 Stopping using oil will transform the oil industry.
7753 2018-12-29 21:55:58 Just tried to be scammed on @Gumtree by a women /gang named Helen Sainton. Looked like Asian account trying to get me to transfer money they apparently paid me for courier pickup. Said she worked on oil rig and item was for a family member in . Be careful folks

7756 2018-12-29 21:55:50 Yes!! The oil slick! 
I want those myself
7757 2018-12-29 21:55:44 It is true that no one has ever finished a pop of nuln oil, for they only get spilled
7758 2018-12-29 21:55:44 I think I seared afterwards in a cast iron skillet with butter/olive oil. How does one sear something with mayonnaise?
7759 2018-12-29 21:55:41 Is that because of Policies imposed by Oil Producing Countries?
7760 2018-12-29 21:55:35 Like straight up coconut oil?

7762 2018-12-29 21:55:20 I’m in bed, we’ve been tidying so my space is clean, got lavender oil in my diffuser, the electric blanket is keeping me cosy & I have a new book. #happiness #simplepleasures
7763 2018-12-29 21:55:20 IM GOING TO MICHAELS after this oil change, I deserve it!!
7764 2018-12-29 21:55:16 Assad and Russia have been fighting ISIS... ISIS has been murdering Alawites from the beginning... You've devolved into "they are bad" as if the Neo-Cons who got us in this had anything but oil in mind...

7768 2018-12-29 21:54:38 It takes OIL to make everything!  She has a HUGE connection to Tom Steyer.  Are they making a back room deal to make them both rich-er?

7772 2018-12-29 21:54:01 In my opinion Trump is abandoning the Middle East and allowing Putin and Chinese influence to carve up the place which means Israel is in grave risk.........I simply don't buy into a Saudi Israeli partnership.  The Saudis go where the Oil Buyers are.  Period.

7775 2018-12-29 21:53:56 A donation to Liberals is a donation to a party as beholden to big oil as the Conservatives are, who have no intentions of meeting GHG targets in time to prevent climate catastrophe.
7776 2018-12-29 21:53:54 Something to include in your personal #ClimateAction strategy is check your retirement + personal investment funds. Divest from fossil fuel, oil, coal, and invest in Clean Energy.

ie. Retirement fund plan with work. Check what companies your plan is invested in. #climatechange
7777 2018-12-29 21:53:51 了解です、向かってみます
7778 2018-12-29 21:53:45 The used olive oil for everything but that could cause infections, right?
7779 2018-12-29 21:53:32 Well, how about we actually finish proper environmental assessments then build said pipeline. Additionally, we should probably work on diversifying our economy so that the next oil bust doesn’t drop Alberta to her knees. And actually save a heritage fund so we have a safety net.
7780 2018-12-29 21:53:28 Wrong. Do both. Do it all. End the handouts to big oil. End the free-ride for billionaire tax cheats. Put them in prison.
7781 2018-12-29 21:53:00 Thanks @walmart for haphazardly giving me oil thats shit for my vehicle and made it drain oil. Now i have to budget in another oil change
7782 2018-12-29 21:52:58 The suspect nature of ther Iraq war benfitting BP oil sales and Tony Blairs career leaves a bad taste in my mouth as to how far politics will go to ensure prosperity

7787 2018-12-29 21:52:23 My first acts as King will be as follows
1. Be fitted for crown and robe
2. Muzzies OUT
3. Crank up those oil rigs
4. Declare war on California and Minnesota 
5. Send Trudeau and Climate Dummy a gift wrapped barrel of oil

Oh butter the hens as they fly.
7790 2018-12-29 21:52:06 If we haven’t learned anything from Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima Japan, then my answer would be, Natural Gas. It burns more cleanly than other fossil fuels, such as oil and coal, has less health concerns and is currently a major source of electricity and heating.
7791 2018-12-29 21:51:33 Amazon give the government a brown envelope..and pay fuck all.. like uber.. oil the palms of government...
7792 2018-12-29 21:51:30 Seeing all the plastic and oil floating nowadays makes my blood boil, I suppose oil is the biggest share of pollution in the ocean ?
7793 2018-12-29 21:51:25 Tried to make a self portrait and wound up successfully making an oil pastel drawing of Brian Peppers.
7794 2018-12-29 21:51:10 I find it interesting how people blame Bernie for Hillary's loss when it was the electoral college that screwed America. On another note, pointing to someones voting record or that they take money from oil executives is not an attack.

7797 2018-12-29 21:50:12 Wait, you sit in the car while they’re doing the oil change??
7798 2018-12-29 21:50:04 @joshuacornett_2 Hello, my na.e is joe. I'm from texas. I notice you invested in oil. I'm trying to invest but I do t understand it. I was wondering if you could help me
7799 2018-12-29 21:50:00 Im dedicating my entire off day to my car. I need new tires, brakes fixed, oil change and car washed 
7800 2018-12-29 21:49:53 @KimKardashian Plz let us know any updates on your psoriasis and what you are using to help . I hope the monoi oil will help .
7801 2018-12-29 21:49:45 To the guy who brought in cheap oil from Saudi Arabia that has caused  companies to compete... lay offs coming soon. Not only that far less tax revenue to an already failing government! Great job! 
7802 2018-12-29 21:49:45 Don't you think that if Canada can sell as much LNG, oil, that we could help them?
7803 2018-12-29 21:49:40 Copaíba oil
7804 2018-12-29 21:49:39 If you support the United Conservative Party, you're voting for a Premier who has spent his entire life undermining LGBT rights, who would sell off treaty land in NW AB, who wants to scrap the climate plan, expand the oil sands and ignore the human rights of indigenous folks...
7805 2018-12-29 21:49:31 I need brakes, two new front tires (they’re bald), and somebody to put my oil drain cover back on 
7806 2018-12-29 21:49:22 Now that #UsMovie used “I got 5 on it”, we’re gonna see a bunch of acoustic covers by white folks who sound like the Oil Spill lady from bobs burgers. 
7807 2018-12-29 21:49:19 Okayyy somebody teach me how to change my oil
7808 2018-12-29 21:49:10 I gotcha! It’s a non psychoactive oil derived from hemp plants that works for seriously soooo many ailments and issues for people and pets! I love sharing the info cuz it’s soooo important as a natural alternative and is helping out a lot of people! Def worth the inquiry
7809 2018-12-29 21:49:09 Fucking synthetic ate my sealants out and drained out my oil
7810 2018-12-29 21:49:06 オイルだからってオイルツイートばかりな訳じゃないぞ。油ツイートもするよ。
7811 2018-12-29 21:49:04 Sitting in the car at the place getting my oil changed and I am so afraid of being rude that I don’t want to roll my window back up even tho the smell of oil is making me sick... bc I don’t want them to think I’m too good to have my window down
7812 2018-12-29 21:49:04 It is all too cruel to blame neck oil for Barmy Choice's glossolalia. He's evidently been boning up - sorry, rediscovering - his Ulysses. Ah, the benefit of a Jesuit education, as Barmy's co-patronymic James might have said.
7813 2018-12-29 21:49:02 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
7814 2018-12-29 21:49:01 I have descended into an internet rabbit hole and discovered celebrity dating timelines. I might've developed a mild addiction to Olbas Oil. I'm having a wild Saturday night.
7815 2018-12-29 21:48:46 Yes, I have been told the oil is good, them smokes are not PC nowadays, make ya breath smell as well.
7816 2018-12-29 21:48:13 Lesson learned. Never let walmart give you different car oil. I had been using high mileage designed to slow leaks down and when walmart gave me full synthetic instead it caused my oil to guzzle out ugh
7817 2018-12-29 21:48:03 my grandpa filled my tank when he took my car for an oil change and i wanted to cry because HOW SWEEEEET

im getting old
7818 2018-12-29 21:47:58 Given no sourcing, will conclude CEOs giving 10s of thousands to Beto is false.   The total all oil and gas industry employees gave was in 250K range, I believe
7819 2018-12-29 21:47:56 Heat olive oil over medium high until a light gaze forms. Add onion. Cook until soft but not browned. Add remaining ingredients. Reduce heat to medium low. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 15 to 20 minutes. Adjust seasoning to taste. 

Add crushed red pepper for spicy sauce!
7820 2018-12-29 21:47:52 You’re putting words into my mouth that I did not say. She did not hold the same values as I do. She said sp would never, ever happen, she’s pro oil/fracking, pro Wall Street, pro TPP, among other issues & history. I couldn’t support her any more than I could support Trump.
7821 2018-12-29 21:47:04 Did u guys put cardboard and motor oil on those pancake :0?!?

7823 2018-12-29 21:46:53 The real question is,... you prefer Canada’s oil or Oil for another región? 
7824 2018-12-29 21:46:41 Well have you ever wondered how the Fairy dishwashing liquid is made? Or baby oil?
7825 2018-12-29 21:46:38 食パンさんおはようございます！
7826 2018-12-29 21:46:24 Have her parents tried detixing her TRS, or Hemp oil, CBD oil? A lot of our injured children are being helped with these! I will Pray for your cousin! 
7827 2018-12-29 21:46:22 I like it. I use their leave in conditioner and double butter cream..they also released a hair oil that I use on my braids to help with care and growth 
7828 2018-12-29 21:46:10 うん！頑張ろう！
7829 2018-12-29 21:46:06 Luke omits to point out that where 1 bbl of oil was once needed to extract 30 to 50 barrels of oil, now in places like Canada tar sands energy intensity is 1 to 5 or less. So I'm afraid Luke's 'what' is a non-sequitur
7830 2018-12-29 21:45:55 No get the crust toppers on whatever pizza you get. Crust toppers are parmesan and olive oil on the crust. It's free if you ask for it.
7831 2018-12-29 21:45:38 Getting my tires rotated (bc my brother told me to) & this man is trying to get me to buy new rims for my tires like sir the extent of effort I put into my car is putting gas and getting oil changes no thank u
7832 2018-12-29 21:45:35 He was a teacher, a minister, & a president of dis great nation,he is humble,mik & wise.He served as d minister of finance under Gen Gowon, wen Nig had her oil boom,& yet did not own a house,Obj built the 1in ABJ & sokoto govt built d one in sokoto.Integrity sure
@Democracy_2day
7833 2018-12-29 21:45:22 380 for an oil change? Hell nab
7834 2018-12-29 21:44:53 Welcome to the New Year.

And to the infinite number of ads for weight loss, gyms, fitness equipment, diet pills, hypnosis, snake oil, etc.
7835 2018-12-29 21:44:46 What your car do when it need an oil change lmao
7836 2018-12-29 21:44:42 Apparently they need to be thawed a little. I guess they have coconut oil which needs to soften up to allow all of that is supposed to come out to come out. The stuff left at the bottom is probably coconut oil. @tastefullytayy figured it out.
7837 2018-12-29 21:44:37 So I usually wash my face twice a day, clean with a toner, apply the vitamin C serum next and follow up with a night or day oil depending on the time of the day.
7838 2018-12-29 21:44:31 What I’ve learned from other Canadians who don’t work in the oil industry but like to think they have it all figured out: Gender Equality isn’t important in Canada, but kicking another province when they’re down is important.
7839 2018-12-29 21:44:30 "Rural Municipalities of Alberta request the Government of Alberta to immediately strike a multi-stakeholder committee to work at reducing the use of potable water and explore alternate options for use by the oil and gas industry in Alberta."  @SynergyAlberta @OilGasCanada
7840 2018-12-29 21:44:27 *cooks breakfast sausages 
And the oil pops and got on me*

Why do all the things I love hurt me????
7841 2018-12-29 21:44:10 cars are fuckin ridiculous bro. always needin some new shit!! bitch take this gas and this oil change and relax!!
7842 2018-12-29 21:44:07 Finally getting my oil changed  I feel so productive today. Hopefully I don't go in Pep Boys buying unnecessary shit while I'm waiting 
7843 2018-12-29 21:44:06 Yes. The Shallow people fogot to study Mother .. Oil gas lumber potash. Etc etc etc.. Grow up
7844 2018-12-29 21:43:59 Okay, who's spraying the ball in Dallas with cooking oil? #NDvsCLEM
7845 2018-12-29 21:43:54 And so long as no one counts the GHG emissions escaping from tens of thousands of oil and gas wells in western Canada. #abpoli #cdnpoli
7846 2018-12-29 21:43:52 Our defense sucks...with special mention to Benning, who stands out on almost every shift (and not in a good way)!
7847 2018-12-29 21:43:44 I’d rather be a parent than be a roofer in the summer time in Texas. Or an oil driller drilling to the middle of the earth.
7848 2018-12-29 21:43:44 Regardless of how you feel about the oil and gas industry, please, please do not disrespect the families, communities and regions who derive their livelihood from it. We are all Canadians doing our best in uncertain times & we need each other more than ever #newyearnewattitudes

7851 2018-12-29 21:43:40 Salsa do Pomodori di Anna Maria 

2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 cup chopped yellow onions
2 cups coarsely chopped plum tomatoes
3 tablespoons tomato paste
1 tablespoon basil, chiffonaded OR 1 tsp dried basil
1 teaspoon sugar (or diabetes safe sweetener)
Salt and pepper to taste
7852 2018-12-29 21:43:30 The info on Standard Oil was interesting and persuasive. But the sudden last paragraph conclusion - 'therefore anti-trust laws make things worse' is not supported by info provided in the article.
Needs lot more comparative data plus orthogonal thinking to answer that question.
7853 2018-12-29 21:43:28 Minus the coconut oil.... I can’t do it 
7854 2018-12-29 21:43:14 Lol she don't know you're a family woman now, no time fr unproductive stuffs
7855 2018-12-29 21:43:13 can’t wait to run my man a shower, pour oil on the floor, then beat him w/ a belt 
7856 2018-12-29 21:43:10 Oh great. Now @ericnuttall has blocked me. I guess a little bit of reality was too much for him to handle. Oil prices are on its way to $30 as the world is reducing it's dependence on dirty oil to protect the precious gift of our environment.
7857 2018-12-29 21:43:02 Alright
7858 2018-12-29 21:42:50 Go Colts! Safe travels. Hope the plane brings better luck in Nashville than it did for Purdue. Thanks for your generosity. #SuperBowl See you at Lucas Oil next weekend!
7859 2018-12-29 21:42:42 Send your CV to tundebanjoko@bofarmsltd.com,hope you know farms don't pay like banks or oil company.
7860 2018-12-29 21:42:40  Funding "social" programs do not mean socialism or communism. 

Venezuela funded their government on selling oil reserves, nationalised industry (i.e. communism), and collapsed due to inflation caused by deficit spending (a favorite of Republicans).
7861 2018-12-29 21:42:37 They got baby Oil Gel on the football?
7862 2018-12-29 21:42:35 Siri, look up "how to get the smell of fish oil out of the only nice sweater I own"
7863 2018-12-29 21:42:20 NOBODY TOLD ME TEA TREE OIL SMELLS SO BAD I JUST PUT THIS ALL OVER MY FACE AND I THINK I’M GONNA THROW UP
7864 2018-12-29 21:42:07 Do it yo self for just the price of the oil
7865 2018-12-29 21:42:01 In oil refineries, asphalt is the bottom of the barrel after they've sucked all the fuels out. Then they blow air through it to make is tacky. Basically tar.
7866 2018-12-29 21:41:58 ちなさん お大事にです..(..)
自分も8年ぐらい前に年末インフルで、帰省できずにひとり寂しく年を越した記憶が、、
7867 2018-12-29 21:41:57 Yep, I have tried lots of remedies (essential oils, vitamins, CBD oil, diet changes), some things can help, some don't, most are incredibly expensive....but we try these things because doctors say "you'll be in pain the rest of your life" and shrug. The desperation is real.
7868 2018-12-29 21:41:28 Getting my oil changed
7869 2018-12-29 21:41:22 Ohh yes they are. Oil is not going away or will it anytime soon. Natural Gas is the most reliable resource to heat homes in our winter climate.
7870 2018-12-29 21:41:12 i tried the laura mercier oil free foundation primer and WHEW BABYYYYYY. i wish i cherished her when i had here.
7871 2018-12-29 21:40:24 Foreign policy = international laughinstock, Oil comback = at lowest $ in 2 decades, Stock market = crashed (again), tax reform = big $ for big biz, Independent Cognition = I just peed a li’l, Business Upturn = notsomuch, Diminished Terror threat = 2 dead babies.

7874 2018-12-29 21:40:17 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
7875 2018-12-29 21:40:17 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
7876 2018-12-29 21:40:07 知ってる？大学って大して重要じゃないんだよ。焦ってる暇あったら油、飲も？
7877 2018-12-29 21:40:06 Girl I use shea moisture black soap and a coconut oil based moisturizer on my face. They cost 12 bucks all together lol
7878 2018-12-29 21:40:05 How to you intend to raise the global price of oil so that Canadian oil can be sold at a profit? Be specific please.
7879 2018-12-29 21:40:01 @KimKardashian have u tried monoi oil before ? My advice is for you to have your makeup artist switch to natural makeup products . Whatever chemicals goes in your skin will affect the psoriasis . Ask Kourtney for help she knows a lot of Natural
 products . @kourtneykardash
7880 2018-12-29 21:39:48 “Reasoning” and “Trump” cannot be made to fit any more than “oil” and “water."
7881 2018-12-29 21:39:46 No mind the guy abeg
7882 2018-12-29 21:39:33 ICYMI: Good news sa mga motorista sa pagpasok ng Bagong Taon, big time oil price rollback sa krudo, umarangkada na #SundayUpdates #DZRHNationwide
7883 2018-12-29 21:39:31 Fox News Anchors know that when the orange man cries about #CNN being unfair, more than one earthling dies a slow emotional death
7884 2018-12-29 21:39:21 Honestly, US could never replicate the models any of those countries follow. Norway for example earns around $30,000 per household per year just from its oil resources alone, which is huge. They are all low population with low immigration and have low work satisfaction rates too
7885 2018-12-29 21:39:18 I've been using groundnut oil thinking I was acting on the advice of one of your fab shows. Someone pointed out recently I may be wrong and there were no results for this oil. Confused!
7886 2018-12-29 21:39:05 The world consumes 100 million barrels of oil per day. It's forecasted to increase 1.4 million barrels per day in 2019. 

Huh, it seems like there's a market for the stuff after all.
7887 2018-12-29 21:38:58 Many of the issues unemployed oil workers also face, men and women, is that employers are not interested in employing them because they feel they will jump ship as soon as the oil industry makes a comeback. If it makes a comeback.
7888 2018-12-29 21:38:29 Cool! We can keep buying your oil. Let Arab oil stay there without destroying the USA. #GreatLakePipelines #ElectricCar

7890 2018-12-29 21:38:23 今日はUMBでBARBERくんの

応援行って夜はolive oilさん 

これでライブ納めになるだろうな〜〜

一番olive oilさんのライブに行ったな 
7891 2018-12-29 21:38:16 Mexico isn’t the only country wanting to cross , you have Guatemala , Honduras , and Venezuela ! Now if you go to Caracas make sure you take TOILET PAPER with you and some lamb chops , this country has more oil than Koweït and still lives in the DARK AGES , like the DEMOCRATS !!
7892 2018-12-29 21:38:16 Why no tweets on taking the transportation of oil away from the rail and road? An obvious hedge against global warming. As usual, the Fed Liberals are too soft to answer “real” issues. #tippytoe #whatif #ahhhhhhh
7893 2018-12-29 21:38:14 Looks to me that the people of southern BC like the drug pipelines more than oil pipelines.
7894 2018-12-29 21:38:12 These are way nicer than lettuce, this cabbage was your destiny all along.....slice it mightyy thin on a mandolin thingy, put on some vinegar and oil or Mayo...don't forget the pepper and salt!
7895 2018-12-29 21:38:11 Try CBD dog oil!!!
7896 2018-12-29 21:38:10 My car can't burn oil if there's no oil left to burn..
7897 2018-12-29 21:38:03 食パンさんおはよー！
7898 2018-12-29 21:38:02 You’re welcome. It’s temporary. Canada has dropped production of oil to prop up the price of crude....
7899 2018-12-29 21:37:39 Wooooooowwwww 
7900 2018-12-29 21:37:39 Well let's pick the means to which we are to fight. I suggest hot oil wrestling. But I'm a bit chivalrous so it's going to be ladies choice.
7901 2018-12-29 21:37:38 What I've learned from the Alberta oil industry.  Basic economics/supply and demand don't apply.  Voodoo economics when mixed with tar sands smells pungently of bullshit.  Alberta Conservative  wine is horrible but the supply is endless. If only it had energy value.
7902 2018-12-29 21:37:35 You haven’t tried yam and brake oil yet. 
7903 2018-12-29 21:37:32 Tf my cats brother got an oil portrait before her 
7904 2018-12-29 21:37:31 @JustinTrudeau 

Just thinking about upcoming election and what I would like to see before then, in no particular order
A way to get Alberta oil to market,
End of USA aluminum & steel tariffs (continuance of ours while we work on that),
Expanded export markets,
7905 2018-12-29 21:37:26 Where you buy that palm oil for that blue keg?
7906 2018-12-29 21:37:22 IMO the “why” is less important than the “what”: From 1974-2003, a face value UST ($1,000) consistently bought 30-50 bbls of oil; from 2004-2011 it bought 7-25 bbls; when US prints $100T for entitlemts, it may buy 1-7 bbls, so the world must end USDs oil pricing monopoly.
7907 2018-12-29 21:37:15 You blow them income taxes next year if you want. You going to be looking like the women with no oil in their lamp.
7908 2018-12-29 21:37:13 Hypocrisy Man: Slimier than a snake coated with oil! More hypocritical than a right wing preacher in a brothel! Able to launch multiple lies in a single sentence!
7909 2018-12-29 21:37:13 It’s like spicy oil water that cooks vegetables and meat then you pick it out and eat it  often includes every part of the animal intestines etc
7910 2018-12-29 21:36:59 One thing I have to wonder... when we move away from oil dependence to electric... wouldn’t that drive the cost of oil/gas downward?   If that happens, would there be a point where it will actually cost more to drive an EV then ICEV?   Something to ponder 
7911 2018-12-29 21:36:48 WHY PUTTING SOME FREAKING OIL!!?!!!!
7912 2018-12-29 21:36:41 Oil of Every Pearls Un-Insides
7913 2018-12-29 21:36:33 Coconut oil babes
7914 2018-12-29 21:36:27 My skin gets like that too. I bought khiel’s face moisturizer and a face oil from Sephora or Khiel’s. Anything with natural seed/flower oils. Saved my face.
7915 2018-12-29 21:36:26 So someone points out that Beto is number 2 on receiving oil/gas money and the Democrats perceive that as an attack from supporters of Bernie? And I have followers believing that..?
7916 2018-12-29 21:36:00 Tea tree oil, also known as melaleuca oil, is an essential oil that comes from steaming the leaves of the Australian tea tree.When used topically, is believed to be antibacterial. Tea tree oil is commonly used to treat acne, athlete's foot, lice, nail fungus and insect bites.
7917 2018-12-29 21:35:55 youre not from wyoming if you dont have olive oil with your hot sauce
7918 2018-12-29 21:35:51 Stanely Druckenmiller called oil a great long in April 2015. He hasn't a clue what hes talking about and that's why hes doing so many interviews now
7919 2018-12-29 21:35:38 Where has it gone?

It's Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!  #UKOG
7920 2018-12-29 21:35:32 I had one of the girls at work oil my scalp
7921 2018-12-29 21:35:28 You mean to tell me that peppermint oil won’t help my fever AND the pain from falling down all of my stairs yesterday? I feel betrayed
7922 2018-12-29 21:35:22 Here's an idea for your next project! Oil pastels + pathes + places you want to go + textured! Go!
7923 2018-12-29 21:34:59 Extremely hard in WV. They had a Berniecrat but Manchin has the elderly and oil vote.
7924 2018-12-29 21:34:51 Ebi energy tombo... brother wey dey use coconut oil, shea butter go always love Natural Nubian Queens...by the way, you spoil there waa for @wanlov ein #No_Service top... I dey feel you bro.
7925 2018-12-29 21:34:35 I read the article and still feel that comparing Google or Facebook to Standard Oil is like comparing apples to oranges.  A monopoly like Walmart does deliver consumers lower costs but it also the quality of goods/services also suffers.
7926 2018-12-29 21:34:26 if I go one more day without an oil change I'm gonna spray my load all over the fucking parking lot
7927 2018-12-29 21:34:21 That's right Bernie just keep spewing your lies about socialism don't forget to mention how Venezuela the oil richest country in the world has become less than a 3rd world country thanks to socialism.
7928 2018-12-29 21:34:09 Eucalyptus oil is definitely my favorite
7929 2018-12-29 21:33:54 you guys i bought a floral oil scent!!! for aroma ~~ therapy ~~

we'll see if i like it
and if not i shall try new scent!
7930 2018-12-29 21:33:49 Last month they just became net oil exporting nation
7931 2018-12-29 21:33:48 I Respect the oil
7932 2018-12-29 21:33:41 A Harley? So she's pushing it and it's leaving oil everywhere 
In heels and shades.
7933 2018-12-29 21:33:21 Oil change #adulting  
Everything we’ve done today required an ID card. We are adulting hard #spitmydaughtersays
7934 2018-12-29 21:33:02 Pake cuci mukak yang oil control, tapi kenapa makin berminyak ini mukak 
7935 2018-12-29 21:33:00 Once you deny scientific reality as part of your political world view, you cannot really be taken seriously on any subject. Rex should just stick to paid speaking gigs for oil and gas companies.
7936 2018-12-29 21:32:56 Now that my leave-in & oil are in my hair, it's time for food. After food, I will begin the process of twisting my hair. I have so much hair on my head.  #naturalhair #somuchhair
7937 2018-12-29 21:32:18 Take firm tofu, press under a weight to remove excess moisture; cube, put into marinade (I used ginger, garlic, soy, sesame oil, water but there are many variations); after a few hours, drain, put on non-stick baking sheet, and bake until as shrunken and crisp as you like.
7938 2018-12-29 21:32:11 Come to AB for the oil profits. Stay to pay off $200B in stranded well cleanup. Will WCS ever be profitable again? Hint: not for the last 5 years.
7939 2018-12-29 21:32:00 Shoutout to @VelvetNoirBC though. I used to use beard products but they were always missing something. This year, I used their beard butter and beard oil and my shiii immaculate. Y’all the real MVPs.
7940 2018-12-29 21:31:53 But Canada has more oil reserves than any other single country. We don’t need to go to the Middle East or drill important places- we need to strengthen our relationships with our neighbors, who have all the oil (and trump hates!)
7941 2018-12-29 21:31:46 I just use organix argan oil. The blue one.
7942 2018-12-29 21:31:43 Unless they're boiling the arsehole in oil, I can't imagine it being entertaining.
7943 2018-12-29 21:31:27 Apna tv ko oil main fry karoo...geo khud hi jall jai ga....
7944 2018-12-29 21:31:27 Spending Saturday afternoon getting an oil change in my van. 
7945 2018-12-29 21:31:14 May I suggest an amendment?
How about...
 "...Free Alberta now, WHILE WE THINK WE'RE RICH"?

Also, just wondering if you'll want back in once the oil & gas revenues dry up?
7946 2018-12-29 21:31:09 CBD oil being No 1. Used for/by people with ASD/anxiety. Has helped my son A LOT. Not every1 has a success story with CBD oil but the stats are staggering. I have lots of info to share if interested. Now being prescribed by GPs here in London so yeah...
7947 2018-12-29 21:30:39 When I see those words "dirty oil" when referencing a Canadian resource,  I see the flag of ignorance flying high and proud
7948 2018-12-29 21:30:29 Gonna hunker down and finish an oil painting, not sure what I want to listen to 
7949 2018-12-29 21:30:19 I’m starting to use more coconut oil. Shea butter dries up and turns into build up
7950 2018-12-29 21:30:17 Your stache is amazing. Do you oil it? It’s so glossy
7951 2018-12-29 21:30:17 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
7952 2018-12-29 21:30:16 Someone just asked Carrie how her shower broke, she looked at me and said “she slipped in baby oil & mayonnaise”

And in that moment I really wished she was kidding

7956 2018-12-29 21:29:53 Greetings! You will notice the oil in the reservoir window will be nearly gone, and you’ll see that your dose pen will produce less or no vapor. When either of these things happen it’s time for a new dose pen! Hope this helps, let us know if you have any other questions!
7957 2018-12-29 21:29:15 Just imagine Wai wanne option "yadanfi sauki"  ... My take: Firstly, I don't even believe, may be a teaser to heat up debate & 2ndly, if this is true, then, the writer has provided a clue to his answer, which is ..... Suzabi Jahannaman datafi dan sauki dashi da ita
7958 2018-12-29 21:28:56 China removes tariffs from crude oil imports.

Trump did that, too...
7959 2018-12-29 21:28:46 "Buy the Mary-You-Wanna oil from the affiliate link, finally help me get back my money you stole, Massies"

Like really I would get terminated. Unprofessional as heck.
7960 2018-12-29 21:28:45 Coca en la Oil
7961 2018-12-29 21:28:39 I would spray that freak with skunk oil and watch him try to run from himself
7962 2018-12-29 21:28:28 ahaha, I doubt we really used oil paint (all I really remember is acrylic and I want to believe my ms' teachers were brainful enough) but maybe it was a mix of turpentine(?), things drying, acrylic paint over its date or other stuffs altogether (glue? crayons? ink?) .-. who knows
7963 2018-12-29 21:28:22 This I imagine would expand the power of proven oil reserves greatly. Maybe not the best message to send when Russia has what it has
7964 2018-12-29 21:28:02 European SOCIAL DEMOCRACIES are in trouble. They embraced some socialist features only to realize a system that decries/punishes success+rewards sloth/mediocrity is unsustainable. Introduce MULTICULTURALISM+GLOBALISM+MIGRATIONS. Now it's a mess not mixing anymore than oil+water.
7965 2018-12-29 21:28:02 How come every time I come for an oil change they finesse me into changing my filters! Smh
7966 2018-12-29 21:27:59 CBD oil.
7967 2018-12-29 21:27:57 That’s nonsense. There’s so much oil on this planet.
7968 2018-12-29 21:27:57 Just ordered my first bottle of cbd oil I cannot WAIT to try it
7969 2018-12-29 21:27:47 Selling #oil for less than it costs to produce is stoopid.
7970 2018-12-29 21:27:42 Foreign policy, Oil comeback,two justices,Stock market,tax reform,Independent Cognition, Business Upturn,Diminished Terror threat...Border Security. It's Like Magic,that may explain the witch hunt .
7971 2018-12-29 21:27:36 I KNOW! And crossing the underwater cavern was cool. The point is no one bleated at Norway about nasty pipelines or potential leaks!!
We have the largest oil reserve, that translates into political power. The protest is NOT about nature!!

7975 2018-12-29 21:27:09 The place that I get my oil change at have the best customer service!!! like he jus cleaned my front window( actually getting a wash next) & put air in my tire lol that was real kind of him being that all he had to do was change the oil

7978 2018-12-29 21:26:49 I am all for others like Ro Khanna too. I just want us to go in the right direction. We only have 10 years & already Chuck Schumer & Nancy Pelosi are not backing the Green new deal ex: they chose dem representative that take/invested in oil & gas $$ to lead the climate committee.
7979 2018-12-29 21:26:42 Um, it’s the consistency of motor oil. #Yuck #DownTheDrain
7980 2018-12-29 21:26:30 Aventus Creed oil gift me some one
7981 2018-12-29 21:26:19 Really, you think you control global oil pricing. What planet are you on
7982 2018-12-29 21:26:15 A new report found that @USRepKCastor has up to $100,000 invested in oil, gas, and coal utility companies.
This is definitive proofing the DNC’s attempt to kill the possibility of a Green New Deal becoming law.

7985 2018-12-29 21:25:53 we also use CBD oil for a couple of our pack

7987 2018-12-29 21:25:21 I’ve heard great things about oregano oil. Does it really work?
7988 2018-12-29 21:25:18 I couldn’t help but expect trump to demand the oil spoils from the Iraqis for US doing them the favor of fighting George Bushes war.
7989 2018-12-29 21:25:11 Truly hope you are feeling better. CBD oil for migraines? I'm really interested in hearing more about this when you have a chance, as my daughter - like me at her age - has some really bad ones. Do you ingest it? Apply it like you do the peppermint oil?
7990 2018-12-29 21:25:04 Whale Oil Beef Hooked
7991 2018-12-29 21:25:03 Also you have ruined one of the core principles of H1 and that is responsible + coordinated disclosure which Marten sells everywhere, you make him look like a snake oil seller.
7992 2018-12-29 21:25:00 He now takes money from Big Oil, and doesn't support Healthcare for All.
7993 2018-12-29 21:24:52 Life skills - getting loan, paying taxes, researching and how to vote, addressing an envelope and postcard, resume writing, health/home/life/auto insurance, addressing another human being in conversation, how to change a tire/oil, how to earn money...
7994 2018-12-29 21:24:26 Yup—Dr. Bronner’s Castile soap with tea tree oil + distilled water = cleaner! I even reuse an old cleaning spray bottle I already had and ripped off the label.
7995 2018-12-29 21:24:22 she was right behind him
7996 2018-12-29 21:24:06 Hmm you are right about the 3rd point. However, how can you be so sure that your first and second point is caused by the actual attacks? Mass shootings and gun related deaths triples since 9/11, but maybe they quadrupled since 1990. Same logic can be used for the oil argument.
7997 2018-12-29 21:23:55 そうですね！イエーイ！
7998 2018-12-29 21:23:45 Sadly u are naive, & blind folded with their antics. I challenge you for a debate if you can. Time start now, why would 22 state owed civil servant salary under @GEJ in spite oil boom between 2012-2014?, Why will @MBuhari have to pay 2005 Paris club refund to states?
7999 2018-12-29 21:23:35 we are now fully independent for oil now though

8002 2018-12-29 21:23:17 Putting baby oil on after you wash your body in the shower is life changing. Thanks for the tip mom.

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?

8006 2018-12-29 21:22:45 Employment rate is not a liberal soin its fact. Oil workers represent nothing in the grand scheme of things if thats what you are referring too.
8007 2018-12-29 21:22:44 AOC is a silver spoon snowflake snake oil salesman that conned her way in to office. This head don't have a clue on how goverment runs.  She will blow her way through her time with the platinum knee pads
8008 2018-12-29 21:22:43 oooo sweaty dirty oil men...
8009 2018-12-29 21:22:43 Secret oil magick- preventing corrosion. When it sits, moisture can’t boil out, goo trap mode.
8010 2018-12-29 21:22:32 While changing the oil in @SidnieLB  car i stumbled upon a nice cold beer in the trunk, im gonna say thats fair game and payment for my work
8011 2018-12-29 21:22:30 Off topic slightly. But I felt that way when I watch the first episode of spooks, and they put that woman's hand in boiling oil!  XxX
8012 2018-12-29 21:22:29 Take out Alberta's oil sands production and we'd be down to Japan levels. So you either kill the oil industry to "do better" or you accept reality. The Canadian oil industry is far better than even US standards. Australia has coal mines
8013 2018-12-29 21:22:27 Yes!  Les chicken wings, dumplings, pork cutlet, chicken cutlet...all with a few drops of avocado oil
8014 2018-12-29 21:22:15 How anal is possible? Is necessary to use oil?
8015 2018-12-29 21:22:09 I think he sells a guide or something. Think it’s basically just meat, fish, butter/oil, eggs and black coffee/water.
8016 2018-12-29 21:21:59 We had one guy who put oil into the sample... I once saw another guy putting water on the sample and then using a 4x air objective.
8017 2018-12-29 21:21:57 Rex Murphy is a shill for big oil
8018 2018-12-29 21:21:49 Kudos for saying that. Not everyone understands this. Am happy someone gets it
8019 2018-12-29 21:21:44 stop washing your hair so much! that’s another problem. find a shampoo that can help with oil control and shit like that.
8020 2018-12-29 21:21:38 And i dey sell oil perfumes.
8021 2018-12-29 21:21:35 I sat in a truck on oil rigs and waited for someone to get injured for 12 hours at a time

8024 2018-12-29 21:21:26 If I had a CNN hat I would use it to check my oil level in my SUV and wipe my dipstick with it. That all that it would be good for.
8025 2018-12-29 21:21:22 Put some sesame oil and soy sauce on it because it’s DONE.
8026 2018-12-29 21:21:17 If OPEC wanted to crash the price, they could and put Shale oil in NA out of business in a few years. There's a reason Aramco is being IPO'd and SA is transitioning the finance as their economic foundation.

8028 2018-12-29 21:20:40 That is why CB’s are buying gold.  Gold holds or increases its value in energy terms.  Always has. USTs cannot.  US kept USD as good as gold for oil fr 1973-2003.  Has failed since, big time
8029 2018-12-29 21:20:40 All I said was Harper failed miserably to build a pipeline to the West Coast to free Alberta oil. When conservatives are faced with the real life consequences of Harpers failure ( Alberta economy) they choose to deflect and talk about other issues.
8030 2018-12-29 21:20:35 This just in ... Oil is a commodity that has price fluctuations daily. TruDope is the only Gov't that put in legislation that will increase gas prices ... starting Tuesday. Enjoy!
8031 2018-12-29 21:20:34 It's not a dangerous substance nor is it illegal or harmful. What I'm trying to find out from Boots is why I was unable to buy castor oil. I bought it from @Tesco without a problem
8032 2018-12-29 21:20:33 Coconut oil is the slut of home remedies
8033 2018-12-29 21:20:29 Why are Americans like sheep! You are letting Trump and his greedy pals make money on making you sick and turning our environment into a toilet. Why you think its ok to be poisoned. It’s not!

Trump and COAL OIL and GAS Co are killing us all! Stand up to stop this!

#TrumpResgin
8034 2018-12-29 21:20:18 Lmfaooooo 'dont have the oil likr city or chelsea' paid 75m for a defender 
8035 2018-12-29 21:20:13 It's not. Takes ten minutes including cutting the onions. Maybe fifteen cause you may have to wait for oil to reach temperature of 365 degrees....  plus they'll always be cooked in fresh oil which will enhance the golden brown color and crispiness when they are done..
8036 2018-12-29 21:20:10 Oil patch medic was by far worse.
8037 2018-12-29 21:20:09 Painful, we keep wasting energy talking power and oil. It means we are either mad or very uninformed, I say this with all due respect. Oil is gone, we ve less than 10 yrs to profit from it, power itself is easy if we are sincere.
8038 2018-12-29 21:20:07 ya boy just changed the oil on his truck .... for the first time 
8039 2018-12-29 21:20:02 寒いからきをつけてね
8040 2018-12-29 21:19:47 You know tfw you're dog sitting for a week in house you also clean & you think, "I'm going to buy some Murphy's Oil Soap & scrub the floor on my hands & knees since I'm here all this time." Then say, "Hmm, maybe I'll clear that shelf & polish it." Then...SIT THE FUCK DOWN & READ!
8041 2018-12-29 21:19:46 What is this wild growth oil I keep hearing about? What does it smell like?
8042 2018-12-29 21:19:43 My cousin gave me this oil defuser & i love it so much
8043 2018-12-29 21:19:28 This certainly wouldn’t have anything to do with lower oil prices. All thanks to you and DoFo. Thanks guys. Woo, climate change! Am I right?
8044 2018-12-29 21:19:14 Thanks - they do use palm oil though (listed in their ingredients). It's like trying to find the holy grail this palm oil free business!
8045 2018-12-29 21:19:01 To @ForksOverKnives & @TColinCampbellF : why is oil a bad thing? If a person gets a first pressing of olive oil, is it processed? I've seen how they press olives for the oil, it's literally just pressed out of the fruit.
8046 2018-12-29 21:18:59 Got to go down yonder to Gander outdoor and get me some gun oil

8048 2018-12-29 21:18:54 When wolfing it’s better to use oil as opposed to using product FYI !
8049 2018-12-29 21:18:45 I did a sheet mask w avocado oil once so that’s the only research I’ve done thus far
8050 2018-12-29 21:18:45 Coconut oil cleans my makeup faster than any soap/facial wash.
8051 2018-12-29 21:18:44 Can you imagine anyone...being conned by this guy and then supporting him? No leader, no example, just a slick snake oil salesman!
8052 2018-12-29 21:18:43  BEARRRRRRD OIL!
8053 2018-12-29 21:18:40 Lol I use vitamin e, tea tree oil, coconut oil, jojoba oil, and Jamaican  black castor oil
8054 2018-12-29 21:18:32 Blake changed the oil in my car for me while I was at work, and I didn’t even ask him to... what a guy
8055 2018-12-29 21:18:28 Low oil price is and will wreak much havoc around the world.
8056 2018-12-29 21:18:27 I've shot everything from shitty tula and wolf to hornady and never had a jam...I did treat mine in CLP for the first 10 years before switching to rem oil.

8058 2018-12-29 21:18:18 WhileI do agree that the future may move away from oil, we need to think of today. We should not put the cart before the horse. People need oil NOW! We cant stop living until a "green" solution is found some day. #buildthepipeline
8059 2018-12-29 21:18:00 Right?! I've explained that even oily skin needs more hydration sometimes and they look at me like I'm selling them snake oil. Lol.
8060 2018-12-29 21:17:56 Rattie taking full advantage of being back on the ice with McJesus and Draisaitl - Oil takes an early 1-0 lead.
8061 2018-12-29 21:17:50 Lower gas prices is do to lower oil prices. 
I've seen this happen many times over the years. Don't even try to make this a big deal. The prices will go up again very soon. This is typical when oil is cheap!!!
8062 2018-12-29 21:17:48 No, he's right about the goal. As it is QC imports nearly 70% of its oil reserves from AB & SK so there goes the other half of your theory. 

QC has a long history of extorting $ from Corps. wishing to transit commodities through the province. Ask NB power producers as an example
8063 2018-12-29 21:17:44 OILS & SPRAYS 
 Keune: satin oil - for dull hair

 Wella: perfect me - lightweight bb lotion.

8065 2018-12-29 21:17:23 Gas prices skyrocketed and a shortage of it because of OPEC oil embargo .
We had to buy gas on odd/even dates that corresponded with 
numbers on our lic. plates.
Long lines at the pump. We pushed the car as the line moved. Lucky our gas station was at the bottom of the hill.
8066 2018-12-29 21:17:09 “ I have spent my entire career in Houston” = “white, white, oil, oil, money money, white”
8067 2018-12-29 21:17:08 Cash remittances are, economically speaking, "arterial bleed"....they are a direct transfer of GDP.... This is a bad thing.
Mexico receives more cash from "us" than it does from oil (see Gulf of...) , At nearly 3% of their GDP, they're almost a "client state".
8068 2018-12-29 21:17:04 The US got no oil out of Iraq, despite fighting there for almost a decade. China, which opposed the war, was the biggest foreign beneficiary of what became Iraq'sbooming oil business industry following the end of the war.

8073 2018-12-29 21:16:46 Is there any way of getting kronke out of the club. I just want some rich Arab with 90 oil fields to take us over and break the financial fair play rules for us.
8074 2018-12-29 21:16:44 @somuchweirdness @NBCNews Try studying economics. Soybeans r a global commodity like oil. Trade pathways adapt & buyers change

8077 2018-12-29 21:16:24 The safest place in a truck convoy was behind a shell  oil truck as they paid a tax to the commies not to be attacked.
8078 2018-12-29 21:16:14 No, EVERYTHING is difficult to trade, it's all a relative thing, and sometimes everythig lines up perfectly with oil, it's all a matter of conviction level, based on probabilities, and position sizing.
8079 2018-12-29 21:16:09 Emery not my type.. U just can't bench or exclude oil... No matter what thats the truth
8080 2018-12-29 21:16:09 okay so i use a a purple shampoo and then a coconut milk conditioner, i get out of the shower and a dab mix moroccan oil with a dab of olaplex #3 and leave that in my hair and that’s the routine
8081 2018-12-29 21:15:56 هي فيها استهزاء(صحيح) لكن في الشعب السوداني مو في الدين لكن الاستهزاء عموما ما يجوز لكن في الدين هذا اللي حاب اعرفه
8082 2018-12-29 21:15:49 My friend's are really cheating me, I feel jealous, what a caption fr a friend
8083 2018-12-29 21:15:41 Musk is aiming to make us multiplanitary, and freeing us from the shackles of big oil. Respect to jobs for all he did, but Musk hands down.
8084 2018-12-29 21:15:19 75 for a oil change i shoulda kept my old car wtf 
8085 2018-12-29 21:15:13 David Suzuki has been on the dole: ie , taxpayers money most of his life,Oil money,Gas money,Coal money & logging money, all the while attacking these industries,( Canada’s Life Blood).
8086 2018-12-29 21:14:55 I lost my oil, salt and holy water bathong 
8087 2018-12-29 21:14:53 People in the U.S.A. protesting against our oil, needs to mind their business,
8088 2018-12-29 21:14:47 If you fucked up the car of some oil tycoon it may send a message, or inconvenience them at least. But random mercedes guy isn’t going to make him reconsider the effects of using an inefficient car, it’s just going to put him out a few hundo and make him late to work or whatever
8089 2018-12-29 21:14:44 True to all those but I’ve discovered a great new regime; cut out palm oil in anything you’d normally buy and not only are you helping the orangutans and rainforests, you’ll loose weight without realising - it’s a win win!
8090 2018-12-29 21:14:34 There no problem. Poppi made of special alloy. No need for rust or oil.
8091 2018-12-29 21:14:06 Oil & gas are not the energy industry, they are merely one part of it. You're making a false dichotomy where the only 2 choices are: we as canadians need to prop up a finite and damaging resource or fail as a country. #scheerstupidity
8092 2018-12-29 21:13:57 Oh shit...i hope not,but that sounds like it will totally be a thing! Maybe try those oil diffusers for relaxing smells?
8093 2018-12-29 21:13:56 The texture was actually a oil texture from @clipstudiopaint material gallery.

Thanks, Krin : )
8094 2018-12-29 21:13:54 can’t wait to run my man a shower, pour oil on the floor, then beat him w/ a belt 
8095 2018-12-29 21:13:54 My room smells tea tree oil I am going to sleep peaceful. Ndishorta nge chamomile tea. Getting it for myself, tomorrow 
8096 2018-12-29 21:13:45 今まで120石もロクにいなかったのです助かりますわ…！
8097 2018-12-29 21:13:37 Guys That Sell Oil Really Be Like You Got Cash App  NO NIGGA. I Don’t Want That Shit. Leave Me Alone 
8098 2018-12-29 21:13:34 Well it’s being developed perhaps extraction would be far cheaper under an independent Scotland, since 2010 some Scottish oilfields pay 85% in extraction tax thanks the the tories for the soul reason of creating a false picture of the state of Scottish oil try reading the info
8099 2018-12-29 21:13:31 A barrel of oil contains 5.8 million BTU's of energy or 1,700-kilowatt hours Roughly equivalent to the energy output of an adult human working 40 hours per week for 12.5 years If we paid the US minimum wage for that amount of work one barrel of oil would cost $203,000. @Go_Rozen
8100 2018-12-29 21:13:20 and the Kurds were used by the USA for the oil...

btw I‘m a anti erdogan but its the truth.
8101 2018-12-29 21:13:13 Such perceived insecurity is American borne - in general people of the Arab world are living good life - original disputes are Palestinian Occupation, Iranian meddling and American domination and last not least Oil wealth of the Arab world.
8102 2018-12-29 21:12:59 You look like a Cheetah that's been dipped in olive oil

8105 2018-12-29 21:12:53 Sex and The City, $160 Lorion diamond face mask, Zen oil in my rainbow light- up diffuser; life is fabulous 
8106 2018-12-29 21:12:33 Int.Court did rule the US must return Iran $$$ and stop interfering in Iranian affairs (Algiers Acc.)  Israel to repay the $1.1bil o/s from Oil invoice. Britain must pay up the $450mil it still owes Iran.  Iraq and Syria should also seek legal redress and make the warmongers pay.

8109 2018-12-29 21:12:29 On the good side, I knocked out 200 pushups.. on the bad side I just tried out a new face oil that smells kinda like old ranch.
8110 2018-12-29 21:12:23 DM a pic lemme see
8111 2018-12-29 21:12:18 Saute leeks in olive oil and garlic until fragrant. Add chicken thigh and marinara sauce. Cook thoroughly. Serve with couscous and a bit of tomato sauce.
8112 2018-12-29 21:12:09 I know about some Canadian oil fields that aren’t being used right now.
8113 2018-12-29 21:11:56 Kinder Morgan doesn't own oil sands mines.  They made a bad investment when they bought TransMountain after TransCanada dumped it.  They waited for the right moment to trap government into buying it at 10 times what it was worth.  Clever of them, costly for us.  We were suckered.
8114 2018-12-29 21:11:55 Toucha, toucha, toucha, touch me

8116 2018-12-29 21:11:44 Diced dork fried rice with king prawns mix with chilli oil omg that's hot lol!
8117 2018-12-29 21:11:36 How much more support does the oil industry need?  They even have the RCMP and CSIS spying on environmental groups as well as the support of all political parties.   However reality keeps getting in the way. The current industry model no longer works.
8118 2018-12-29 21:11:21 Thank you Bongel

8120 2018-12-29 21:11:17 Hey Lisa, check oil prices in December 2014 vs. December 2018. I’ll wait.
8121 2018-12-29 21:11:16 A barrel of oil contains 5.8 million BTU's of energy or 1,700-kilowatt hours Roughly equivalent to the energy output of an adult human working 40 hours per week for 12.5 years If we paid the US minimum wage for that amount of work one barrel of oil would cost $203,000 @LukeGromen

8124 2018-12-29 21:10:53 You're owned by an oil rich nation and were effectively formed in 2008. You'd be in the Championship otherwise.

You know this.

8127 2018-12-29 21:10:49 Oil companies didn't do the brainwashing. Name one item in your daily life that isn't made from oil or delivered by oil. 
It is a fair and hard challenge. Then show us exactly how you would replace the item or delivery with greener option. 
Include craddel to grave ghg please.
8128 2018-12-29 21:10:48 My sweet bf came and got my car from work today, took it to get new tires and an oil change, AND cleaned it out. He’s an angel I tell ya 
8129 2018-12-29 21:10:29 The oil market is already glutted. Adding to the supply will only lower the price.
8130 2018-12-29 21:10:28 People always complain about putting vegetables in stuff like what do yall have against vitamins and foods with nutritional value? Yall will oil, meat and carb yourselves into extinction.
8131 2018-12-29 21:10:27 #TSU22 2nd Semester is always better than the 1st semester because of Que Week and The Oil Spill

8134 2018-12-29 21:10:14 US wouldn’t fix.  US would be free to choose if it wanted cheap oil and cheap gold or expensive oil and expensive gold.
8135 2018-12-29 21:10:11 おーはーよー
8136 2018-12-29 21:10:10 Oil changed, car washed, got food, smoked and I’ll see my friends later, it’s been great :)

8138 2018-12-29 21:09:59 I don't know that a revolution is coming, but I do know that big changes are happening.
Equating a lack of empathy with strength.
Machismo is a fool's errand.

We're gonna have to rebuild the entire country when all the oil runs out.

Gonna go spin the #WhiteAlbum.

#Revolution
8139 2018-12-29 21:09:52 So I’m getting my oil changed and there’s a woman on tv talking about how under represented women are in the US. This woman sitting next to me starts muttering to herself “is that even a problem? I don’t want to be represented” 
8140 2018-12-29 21:09:46 JOJOBA OIL 
8141 2018-12-29 21:09:45 معقدين امراض. حد يقول كلمه ع طول تفتو لا يجوز واستهزاء. لا تقدح من راسك ولا تهرف بما لا تعرف ولا تفتي. يجوز لا يجوز
8142 2018-12-29 21:09:37 Western Canadian Select is a heavy oil blend that requires a different refinement process than light crude. It makes up over 2/3rds of oil production in Canada.
8143 2018-12-29 21:09:16 U ever check the oil in ur car & feel like a mechanic? Bc same
8144 2018-12-29 21:09:13 Why isnt every oil company gone yet? 

Just because a few survive it doesn't justify the government abuse that drove out the rest.
8145 2018-12-29 21:09:01 #AngelEyes Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA has a natural gas plant that smells like crude oil.
8146 2018-12-29 21:09:00 Is Omega 3 oil good for my dog  
8147 2018-12-29 21:08:58 Mark
Exxon wins most in oil & Boeing gets to buy Embraer at low price.  US is getting energy & tech gems of Brazil. Who profits most from Lava Jato? Also, US citizens would never allow a foreign gov to train their prosecutors & then brag when those prosecutors jailed the POTUS!

8150 2018-12-29 21:08:21 Dear Prof, you forgot to add whilst Saudis are about 27 Million with about 11 MBOPD  we are about 200 Million with about 1.6 MBOPD.  To start with ,we are not an Oil Nation as many think.  China does not see itself as one though it produces 4.5 MBOPD. Change our mentality.

8152 2018-12-29 21:07:40 They can find all the oil fields they want, means nothing if the cost of extraction outweighs the value 
8153 2018-12-29 21:07:36 Wrong in a million ways. As if politics and hate are water and oil? Trumps very fuel is to feed people’s hate. It’s his best method to stay alive. For malicious leaders, hate and fear have always been key elements to  reignite to get tired brains to follow.
8154 2018-12-29 21:07:03 Well good job in reducing oil prices worldwide. Seems like Ontario should answer for a lot of the oil and gas industry’s problems. You know, since they have so much power
8155 2018-12-29 21:07:03 #auspol George Bush, John Howard &:Tony Blair should all be put on trial for war crimes for invading Iraq based on a known lie that there was 'weapons of mass destruction '. Real reason was oil. Hudreds of thousands murdered based on this lie.
8156 2018-12-29 21:06:51 Fr bitches be flat ironing their shit with hella oil, its windy as shit out here stink why your bangs stuck to your forehead
8157 2018-12-29 21:06:48 I’ve just recently begun using a face oil.... I thought a serum and a face oil were the same thing... AND THEYRE NOT!!! DO YOUR RESEARCH!!
8158 2018-12-29 21:06:47 almond oil !! minha miga da argentina trouxe um vidrinho e eu passei depois de lavar, por 2 dias. no terceiro dia AMANHECEU ASSIM e tava muito muito macio
8159 2018-12-29 21:06:47 my sister’s surprise honeymoon turned out to be the college football playoffs so i hereby renounce all my morals and if anyone in big oil wants to marry me too i am now open to the idea and accepting all offers
8160 2018-12-29 21:06:39 Oil nation ffs. Grow the fuck up! 
8161 2018-12-29 21:06:37 Besides Alberta isn't the only oil producing province 
8162 2018-12-29 21:06:31 CO2 emissions per capita have decreased. It’s mostly do to population growth and lower oil prices, which counteracted the carbon tax.
8163 2018-12-29 21:06:26 Mi è uscito un vulcano sullo zigomo e spero che la crema al tea tree oil di Beauty Formulas funzioni s u b i t o.
8164 2018-12-29 21:06:17 Appropriate consider I've just been Twitter spatting with defenders of Notley and the NDP's support of the oil and gas industry.
8165 2018-12-29 21:06:08 I really liked bio oil, but I used ponds dark spot corrector on my face and boob stretch marks and that worked well for me too
8166 2018-12-29 21:06:07 I'm well aware we're in an ice age, but the rates at which the earth is warming are unprecedented and unnatural. Unnatural in as never seen before without major volcanic action. The climate is changing and it's a culmination of beef farming, and coal and oil burning
8167 2018-12-29 21:05:43 TODAY IS THE ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF OIL AND WATER VIDEO
8168 2018-12-29 21:05:43 game and watch oil panic actually has an effect like it's covered the victim with oil now. I literally had a dream about that once

8172 2018-12-29 21:05:28 What are you talking about? No I don’t like Saudi oil, I don’t like Saudi Arabia in general. You seem to be attacking a straw man.
8173 2018-12-29 21:05:17 Saudi’s butchered a Washington Post Journalist then flooded the market with oil to pacify Trump’s with low gas prices. Quebec & Ontario have forgotten this & how they treat women like crap plus  their terrible Enviro Regulations. It’s all OK with the East who block a Pipeline
8174 2018-12-29 21:05:16 Just a reminder, the Oil beat the Sharks November 20th, 4-3 in OT. Our Ju-Ju returns today, along with Juhjar. 
8175 2018-12-29 21:05:08 Fair enough.  I wish people realized that everything purchased & consumed was made by or brought to them by oil.  Trucks, trains, ships & planes don’t run on feelings.

If all shipping in general stopped tomorrow, the stores would be empty in 3 days & we’d be eating each other.
8176 2018-12-29 21:05:08 For people that don’t understand how things work try to heat your home with The liberal dust at -50c in Canada see how warm you are at the end of the day we need our Canadian oil and gas see though the liberals bs please

8181 2018-12-29 21:04:54 Haven't seen it yet. Who plays Rupert? Cheney's partner in the neo-con dream and Genie Oil in Syria. Or maybe that's part 2.
8182 2018-12-29 21:04:46 Saudi oil lover!! Go live there!
8183 2018-12-29 21:04:40 Beto's deplorable record, dirty oil money, and elitist billionaire wife speak for themselves. Exposing the truth is a clean campaign tactic. Maybe you should try it sometime instead of wallowing in sh*t and vile fabrications #TruthInMedia

8185 2018-12-29 21:04:11 Failing? No? 
Over-regulated? Yes.

Coal, oil & natural gas are the powerhouses that keep our economy moving & strong.
8186 2018-12-29 21:04:09 OKAY WAIT. So i just left @Walmart.... I was told 4 hours for an oil change. My car was done at 2:30 and you just didn’t bother calling me? Going over the PA? Like what the actual hell?!
8187 2018-12-29 21:03:59 お気をつけて～いってらっしゃいませ！
ご武運を！！
8188 2018-12-29 21:03:47 Some good ideas in there.  I'm not convinced we should be building more Blockbuster stores right when Netflix is clearly on the rise... if you get my drift.  Taxpayers will end up holding the bag. If oil sands companies thought TMX was a profitable investment they'd pay for it.
8189 2018-12-29 21:03:38 ما استهزأ هو شبه شي بشي؟
8190 2018-12-29 21:03:29 Random flashback to a hilarious moment during my freshman year of college, Biology 121: We were having a debate for lab about transporting oil on trains, and we weren’t even able to choose what side we were arguing for or against. A big joke really.
8191 2018-12-29 21:03:20 Our Clean Scent detergent contains natural essential oils of orange and fir needle oil. We also offer an orange blossom scent booster pod!
8192 2018-12-29 21:03:18 We had a plan to use our own products and eliminate our reliance on foreign oil. Alberta actively undermined it.
8193 2018-12-29 21:03:15 High spirit. Problem dey for who no get oil for head. 2019 we must to buy Benz.
8194 2018-12-29 21:03:02 It actually started. Oil pundits can’t deal with this reality: the world is about to change drastically and they can’t do anything about it.
8195 2018-12-29 21:02:59 It’s like Ford thinks he can control the price of oil now
8196 2018-12-29 21:02:57 He repeatedly violated a pledge by taking multiple, maxed-out donations from oil execs. He thinks he's being cute by not taking money from their PACs, but instead getting it another way. He's not, and we're not stupid. We see him.
8197 2018-12-29 21:02:50 Eyah,   in 2019 under his watch Nigeria will start refining all oil (crude,Palm & groundnut oil ) and textile has been revived in Kaduna. The whole of Nigeria will be drag to kaduna for magic soon, abi ? 
Still wanting to get more explanation.
8198 2018-12-29 21:02:40 My vehicle is getting to the high-mileage threshold so I can no longer get cheap oil changes. Look how much this dealership charged me son. 
8199 2018-12-29 21:02:40 yeah uh I hate getting an oil change by myself
8200 2018-12-29 21:02:30 One day Fr. Rohr Id like you speak on how you see spirituality in policitics. I find the two to be like oil and water. Politics demands that one listens with the intent to reply.  Whereas Spirituality encourages one to listen with the intent to understand.
8201 2018-12-29 21:02:28 Pre shave oil, Kiehls shaving cream and Gillette Fusion is the gold standard...
8202 2018-12-29 21:02:14 I'd rather talk about the chaotic, ill-considered decision to send troops there to begin with.

Seriously when the hell did you lefties go all in on "murdering brown people for oil"? Because for at least 16 years you were against that.
8203 2018-12-29 21:02:08 Marquee Strip front property for a place built for locals seems like a waste. And how many bottles of olive oil do you think get broken in the first month on long walk back to parking garage. Imagine navigating busy time with oil and wine.
8204 2018-12-29 21:02:08 We need a Fiduciary Rule for oil/lube places.
8205 2018-12-29 21:02:07 Such a joke. Garbage talk. Lies. Divisive rhetoric. Trump is a fool. All the pacific nations are moving forward. Your farmers are really feeling it. Going to get worse, autos, oil, business, travel, etc.  Then, the Dems take over in the house. 
8206 2018-12-29 21:02:05 Speculating here but if US fixed gold to oil then it would be admission that gold was real money. Then everything in time would be fixed to gold. Back to gold std. This would greatly impede politicians capabilities to promise everything. Therefore no fix

8209 2018-12-29 21:01:46 That's less an indictment on Bernie than on the essentially-closed duopoly of Democrans and Republicrats who are both irretrievably sucking on the Corporate teet. The US Government does the bidding of the Koch brothers, Big Oil, Big Pharma, Wall St etc. not of US Citizens.
8210 2018-12-29 21:01:44 And today in another attempt to try anything to help Sophie, I went to a dispensary and bought her some CBD oil. I hope it gives her the uber munchies.
8211 2018-12-29 21:01:41 The downturn in oil prices caused by the US shale revolution supply glut began in mid-2014, more than a year before the Liberals came to power - or the AB NDP, for that matter. Canada accepts relatively little Saudi oil. The only refinery doing so at this point is Irving in NB.
8212 2018-12-29 21:01:32 2018. Winning Super Bowl. Phillies blowing first place lead in August and Klentak doing nothing to address leaking oil starting pitching, 18 blown saves, and Anemic offense with Machado available

8214 2018-12-29 21:01:20 早起きさんだね！！えらい！！！！
8215 2018-12-29 21:01:19 Waikato Traffic Update: Oil spill on SH1 just north of Tokoroa. Take extra care through the area and follow directions of emergency services. ^RS
8216 2018-12-29 21:00:59 So they get a bulletin every day about what to say. How unusual, not! So stinking corrupt the whole media and yet so many lemmings still believe the crap they are selling. Snake oil salesmen are more trustworthy than these so called journalists.
8217 2018-12-29 21:00:56 better navage stick something up your nose than those snake oil salesmen trying to stick a shitty car up yer ass.
8218 2018-12-29 21:00:52 Coconut oil!!!!!!
8219 2018-12-29 21:00:52 Anyone else tried cbd oil? I bought a bottle today and used it and now I feel horrendously sick.
8220 2018-12-29 21:00:50 We are all "stockholders" . Every single one of us benifits in some way from the oil and gas industry.
8221 2018-12-29 21:00:45 ThePeopleDestroyingThePlanetHaveNamesAddresses
OIL industry’s SECRET #climatechange  predictions are reality. #fossilfuels producers willfully drove us toward the grim future they feared by promoting their products & lying abt the effects

8222 2018-12-29 21:00:11 My mom use to tell me that trolls were evil and that they were a representation of the devil. Once I brought a little small troll doll home and she me burn it and bury the rest then prayed for me and put holy oil on my forehead.. til this day I still can’t look at trolls the same
8223 2018-12-29 21:00:09 People sink billions of dollars a year into 'alternative' cancer treatments.

There will always be snake oil salesmen.

And stupid people to buy it.

That's why the masses need good, benevolent leaders.
8224 2018-12-29 21:00:08 Swolive Oil finally found gay independence and is about that mutinous life.
8225 2018-12-29 21:00:04 Some psuedo-journalists don't even understand inflation and oil prices; or pretend not to.
8226 2018-12-29 20:59:20 He built a lot of houses for wall st bankers... or at least funded them... and oil company and insurance company execs.  Give the guy some credit ;)
8227 2018-12-29 20:58:56 I suppose you one of those Canadians that prefer Saudi oil and hate Canada.
8228 2018-12-29 20:58:34 There was a time in my life where I believed things like "holy oil & holy water "  How gullible was I.
8229 2018-12-29 20:58:22 ...droids in question were very rusted before they were given over to Imp Patrol. The maker of the new droid said it was not their fault, he hadn’t given her oil in days. Imp Patrol needs the Wall and it will all end. They are working so hard & getting so little credit!
8230 2018-12-29 20:58:17 Almost forgot to feed my #hens. They were in need of water. Feed the wild turkeys some black oil #sunflower seeds. Hope to get some pictures again!
8231 2018-12-29 20:58:11 Oil everybody with money and keep the  family happy
8232 2018-12-29 20:58:05 Where is the oil the pipelines will ship destined to be used? Asia? Eastern Canada? Gulf of Mexico?
8233 2018-12-29 20:58:00 The most important thing in this world isn't money or oil it's the bonds we have between each other. Its family and friends and living to make things better for ourselves and others and that's the most important thing.
8234 2018-12-29 20:57:50 I’m tryna fry ling ling pot stickers but the oil is attacking me  I just wanna eat
8235 2018-12-29 20:57:44 Oil changed, car washed, prescriptions picked up. I never realized how much I would loathe errands until I started working.
8236 2018-12-29 20:57:23 It will be a long slow decline but it is declining. Heavy oil will be first, as seen recently, due to the huge supply of light crude.
8237 2018-12-29 20:57:15 You still have to transform it from oil.  It gets more complicated at that point.
8238 2018-12-29 20:57:11 Good evening Alison. Hope you have had a great day. I had a slight slip involving hot cooking oil and my arm. Not too bad. I am sure it happens to you often.
8239 2018-12-29 20:57:09 I didnt bring the CBD oil with me.  I only had peppermint. It helped a little bit to the point that I could dose off finally!
8240 2018-12-29 20:56:47 Its just so dumb, its such a good game but i gotta oil my gun, refill ammo and eat food every 3 seconds 
8241 2018-12-29 20:56:46 Dampen rubber gloves and wipe your hands over couches to get the pet hair up !! Chemical free and reusable
I use bicarbonate of soda with a couple of drops of lavender essential oil for carpet smells too, drilled some holes in a jam jar lid to make a shaker !!!
8242 2018-12-29 20:56:36 MIGA o almond oil que @larsenxmai me emprestou PQP MILAGROSO
8243 2018-12-29 20:56:24 at least there's no evidence of an oil spill
8244 2018-12-29 20:56:19 I work with ppl with autism, among others. The number if snake oil salesppl preying on them and families is staggering  ... and we're all impacted with the antivax myth that's persisted worldwide. The struggle is real
8245 2018-12-29 20:56:17 Water and oil don’t mix
8246 2018-12-29 20:56:17 Been there, done it, bought the rectifying baby oil 
8247 2018-12-29 20:56:16 Accepting that premise for the moment; so? Let Russia deal with it. They need a way to get oil out of Russia, so let them play policemen in Syria. Let their military be in harms way. It’s not 1984, Russia is not the enemy. Join the 21st century.
8248 2018-12-29 20:56:13 A one Billion bbl discovery in tight oil, where ~10% of OOIP is recovered would last the world 1 day at current level of demand.
8249 2018-12-29 20:56:10 1/1: #ISLAMABAD: #Misfit sons of #bureaucrates were given jobs in #PIA and Oil and Gase Development as #Pilots and riggers respectively...
8250 2018-12-29 20:56:06 lavender. Put if your labor is quick like mine, you won't even remember you have it haha. Put you can out since drops of lavender in a liquid carrier oil and rub on your wrist. Sniff through contractions
8251 2018-12-29 20:55:54 The governments in Canada do not buy oil. Private, profit-seeking industries do. And, at this point, only Irving in NB (a private, profit-seeking business) is accepting any Saudi Oil.
8252 2018-12-29 20:55:50 Castor Oil.. 
8253 2018-12-29 20:55:29 Oil nisi dovoljno placeni
8254 2018-12-29 20:55:26 Ya, that's why the USA is ramping up their oil supply to the world.... because it's a "dying" "sunset" industry.
8255 2018-12-29 20:55:18 babe, you ready?

- 
- , ,  etc ("nightshades")
- , , , , any citrus
-  + other brassicas 
- coffee
- soy (soy sauce, soybeans, soy oil, soy nuts) (exception: tofu bc ???)
- PLAIN WHITE SUGAR (not an allergy but causes flares so same diff)
- ALL THIS AND MORE!!!
8256 2018-12-29 20:55:12 I'm curious: since some folks say that having a bunch of oil/gas donations doesn't mean anything as they just WORK in that business, have any other Democratic Party candidates--Texas or any state w/oil/gas drilling--received similar amounts of donations from oil/gas "employees"?
8257 2018-12-29 20:55:11 I could only think about hate of free reloading v.s. "their" need to pay (high prices, with taxes), to feed the oil for their trucks.
(In France they used to call that "gilets jaunes".)
8258 2018-12-29 20:55:03 Use an electric and forget to waste oil.
8259 2018-12-29 20:54:59 This is why i have ZERO trust in management to make the RIGHT decisions for short/long term. 4 years in and without McD, Oil are bottom 3 team
8260 2018-12-29 20:54:55 Oil on canvas?
8261 2018-12-29 20:54:43 No oil news for this weekend - I’m gonna watch the #CottonBowl & the #OrangeBowl 

Of course, #NFL games are a staple too 
8262 2018-12-29 20:54:39 fresh bed sheets, shaved legs, face mask on and hot oil in my hair is what i call a good saturday night 
8263 2018-12-29 20:54:38 As a yoga practice is really oil pulling detoxifies body , I went through some side effects of oil pulling also oil pulling is not scientificically not proven ,can you explain. What should I believe sadguru
8264 2018-12-29 20:54:32 They must think that the oil moved via pipelines goes directly into gas tanks and cars. That stuff still has to be refined and who's going to refine it? Irving?  We'll export it then buy gasoline back. So much for cheap gas.
8265 2018-12-29 20:54:31 Want to diminish stretch marks? Use Vitamin E oil and Cocoa butter. You can find both at your local drug store.
8266 2018-12-29 20:54:27 You've still got one. And you oil it regularly.
8267 2018-12-29 20:54:17 I’m so in love. Then at night later an oil on top!!
8268 2018-12-29 20:54:13 I just ordered my dog CBD Oil treats, I’ve become that pet owner 
8269 2018-12-29 20:54:11 I’ve been running around so much I need a oil change
8270 2018-12-29 20:54:02 Anyone wanna take my car to get a new tire, an alignment, and an oil change

8271 2018-12-29 20:53:54 قريبا سيشهد العالم حرب من أجل الماء،أعنف من حرب النفط
Soon the world will see a war for water, more violent than the oil war
8272 2018-12-29 20:53:43 Car dealerships,U tell me U completed 127 pt inspection on a 2015-18 suv, so what! Its free with an oil change at Midas. Btw I know the difference between high retail & wholesale, don’t bend me over. U want to sell, I want to buy. I won’t give U 7k profit 4 used #usedcars #tired
8273 2018-12-29 20:53:13 A new level of laziness, err uh I mean convince. Drive thru oil change. Thanks #valvolineInstantOilChange!
8274 2018-12-29 20:53:07 That is interesting about the sugar... and great idea about the oil, which I am curious what you use. rso? Prayer for healing love, health, and prosperity in the new year. Stay on the mend kid.
8275 2018-12-29 20:52:59 and fat from seed oil which is the worst kind of fat source.  Once upon a time McDonald's fried their potatoes in tallow
8276 2018-12-29 20:52:51 わーい！コミケはサイコーだぜー！
8277 2018-12-29 20:52:36 nikis mom got me bio oil for my burn so it doesnt scar ;-;
8278 2018-12-29 20:52:18 I like it sautéed in olive oil and rosemary, but I wouldn’t call it my favorite fish
8279 2018-12-29 20:52:16 Já assistiu Ookami Kodoko (wolf children)?
8280 2018-12-29 20:52:16 I know it's very difficult, PM 2.5s travel long distances & yes health should be first priority, But fuel poverty is real & does have to be taken into account & Just Transition ensured. In rural areas where piped gas not available, the alternatives are very expensive fuel oil.
8281 2018-12-29 20:52:16 There’s not enough oil on this planet to sustainable gasoline vehicles. We will 1. Eventually run out. 2. Be slowly killed by our emissions problem. We need to make transportation or hydrogen based electric where walking and biking aren’t practical.
8282 2018-12-29 20:52:15 so since when does a oil change cost 100+ dollars
8283 2018-12-29 20:52:04 It will take 500 to 1000 years for this to happen, but think of it. The Renaissance was only 500 years ago. Think if the Romans had been the ones to discover oil. We would be the ones facing catastrophically extreme SLR today.
8284 2018-12-29 20:51:47 Ur government shlf also tell Nigerians what u did with Etisalat, Key Stone bank and our oil money for just only the and a half years of una rule
8285 2018-12-29 20:51:31 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!
8286 2018-12-29 20:51:22 When I was at uni for undergrad it always felt like it was either oil & gas, or academia. If you didn't do those you somehow weren't as good a geologist? Part of the reason why I've not done post grad yet, I don't want the academia route
8287 2018-12-29 20:51:20 "People aren't aware how fragile our tie to energy is. Even now, We're struggling with $80 per barrel" Alen Greenspan in 2007 talking about Iraq war being about oil
8288 2018-12-29 20:51:18 《オリーブ油豆知識》

酸化されにくいオレイン酸を多く含む
他の食用の油脂に比べて酸化されにくく固まりにくい性質を持っている
8289 2018-12-29 20:51:15 三日目じゃないことが何よりも救い( wwww
8290 2018-12-29 20:51:06 gas is really like $5/gallon in Toronto like Canada doesnt supply the US with a sizeable portion of our oil
8291 2018-12-29 20:50:45 try a wet chamomile tea bag. Ik you said you tried tea tree, but i would soak a q tip in the oil and hold it on the piercing until it damn near burned lol. The bump went away in a couple days.
8292 2018-12-29 20:50:38 Also, try avocado oil when roasting up veggies and such. It has those healthy omegas and tastes great too. Also, it isn't hard on the vascular system like lard/shortening/canola/sunflower/safflower oils.
8293 2018-12-29 20:50:27 Cheap gas for who exactly? How would exporting gas to other countries lower gas prices? In fact I hear Alberta complaining about how low oil prices are and they want them raised, not lowered.
8294 2018-12-29 20:50:20 Time to buy oil and gold and maybe muni bonds 
8295 2018-12-29 20:50:18 that must be world wide as most of the US has seen decreases in energy prices due to development of PA gas and Dakota oil.
8296 2018-12-29 20:50:01 To be fair not all that money is from stolen oil, some is from extortion.
8297 2018-12-29 20:49:57 I like to heat it in the microwave so i can eat it while it’s swimming in its own oil
8298 2018-12-29 20:49:56 Compassion should be tempered with wisdom and discernment to guard against foolish, imprudent and impulsive action.
8299 2018-12-29 20:49:56 I took my braids down and now I have this cute faux braid out fro thingy happening. And since we only used oil there’s none of that gel build up stuff. I’m wearing this hair to work 
8300 2018-12-29 20:49:51 What he said is the truth

how can Nigeria have all the natural resources, still no good road,  electricity, education, nothing you can count in Nigeria that's good.

One of the highest oil producing country in the world, we still import fuel. Is that not a shit hole country
8301 2018-12-29 20:49:51 HAHAHA SANA OIL MAS SWEET PA KAYONI LOIS JAN!!! NAGPAPLASTIKAN LANG KAMI NIYAN E PERO ASOT PUSA KAMING DALAWA NIYAN SA TOTOONG BUHAY
8302 2018-12-29 20:49:45 Why do eggs get all "angry" when you put them in a hot pan with oil? Is it because the amniotic fluid is mostly water in a sense?
8303 2018-12-29 20:49:44 Nah my doctor told me peanut oil isn't made from actual peanuts it like made from the plant or something so I'm not allergic to peanut oil

8309 2018-12-29 20:49:16 Oh keefy you are so clever , are you selling cannabis oil now ,you will be smoking that in a pipe soon ,you and president trump and Kim jong un in North Korea are my hero’s , you are starting to look like Kim Jong
8310 2018-12-29 20:49:12 Did I say that I didn't want regulations for those? No, I didn't.
The pipeline frame is a straw man and will not help. Oil is a sunset industry.
8311 2018-12-29 20:49:11 I'm all for massive tariffs on Saudi oil & other countries we don't have trade agreements with.  Good idea.  However, I believe carbon pricing can work, I'm just not convinced the current plan will be effective given the endless subsidies for polluters. Welfare for fossils=insane
8312 2018-12-29 20:49:07 Russia has its warm water port. It has a rich market for oil & gas in cooperation w/Qatar.It has compromised America’s prestige &power by installing a highly valued asset in our White House. It undermines the solidarity of NATO thru that asset.
Impeachment &removal are imperative
8313 2018-12-29 20:49:04 oh!イル
8314 2018-12-29 20:48:47 The crash in oil prices is Trudeau's responsibility?
 Not sure how that works.
8315 2018-12-29 20:48:42 A one billion barrel oil discovery would last the world about 10 days at it's current level of demand. @LukeGromen
8316 2018-12-29 20:48:22 You’ll need 420 to cope with the new oil reality. Maybe that was Trudeau’s plan? ;-)
8317 2018-12-29 20:48:20 Sounds like you need some Lavender Oil before you sleep!
8318 2018-12-29 20:47:58 jamaican black castor oil>>> wild growth oil
8319 2018-12-29 20:47:58 I slept from 5pm last night til 11am this morning. Went to the bank and took my car for an oil change so I think im too exhausted to drive to the springs for our mini trip.

8321 2018-12-29 20:47:41 2/2 trying to get a pipeline West or East to get our oil from Alberta  to market. How could this happen? Please remind Quebec that without Alberta oil to market Canada will not be able to send them their 13 billion in transfer payments for years.
8322 2018-12-29 20:47:39 mayonnaise u know like with a blender and oil
8323 2018-12-29 20:47:21 My car smells like lavender essential oil and I’m here to tell ya, your girl is about to fall right into a slumber at wheel
8324 2018-12-29 20:47:20 Bull, gas prices have plummeted because of collapse of the world oil market, not because of Regressive Convertibles' policies.
8325 2018-12-29 20:47:18 1/2 With the U.S bursting at the seams with an abundance of oil(enough to make OPEC nervous) & enough to significantly increase exports from fracking where is Canada in this mess? Oh that’s right we r dealing with BC’s obstinacy, and Quebec’s intransigence

fresh cut 
fat blunt 
8330 2018-12-29 20:46:29 I do that when I take my car in for an oil change. I hate doing it but they do a good job and it’s always been fine when I come back for it. Good Luck!

8332 2018-12-29 20:46:16 Why don't you just hop in your car and drive out say Drayton Valley or most any other oil town including Calgary and judge for yourself then?
8333 2018-12-29 20:46:12 Leaving it (oil) in the ground is an excellent solution.
8334 2018-12-29 20:46:06 Alright Lemongrass in a oil diffuser?  oh my god

8337 2018-12-29 20:45:46 Why do Italian cooking programs finish every dish off with half a bottle of olive oil?!?! VOMIT
8338 2018-12-29 20:45:27 Walks into @LexdMechanic’s mechanic shop.

He was set on looking for something that his car needed.

“Excuse me, miss? Do you know where I could find anywhere to buy oil for my car?”
8339 2018-12-29 20:45:20 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
8340 2018-12-29 20:45:10 Cleared: Crash in Collier on SR-29 south at Oil Well Rd /CR-858, all lanes blocked. Last updated at 01:58:35PM.

8342 2018-12-29 20:45:07 No it’s not. Those palm oil based spices, knorr and thyme make a huge difference.
8343 2018-12-29 20:45:06 The sad part is these are the people who feed the world and no one is stepping up to help them.  If this something like this was happening to oil companies the politicians would be stepping on one another to get a bailout for them... but the farmers are left to twist in the wind.
8344 2018-12-29 20:45:02 Chop them thin, add tomatoes bit of mustard oil and some salt. And mash them. Goes real good with "gorom bhaat".
8345 2018-12-29 20:45:01 I paid $7.46 for an oil change and tire rotation  yasssssss
8346 2018-12-29 20:44:40 Brah I do not feel like paying $100 for an oil change!!!!!!!
8347 2018-12-29 20:44:36 Those same folks also fast for a large part of the day, try to force a bunch of heavy, fatty food into a short feeding window when they’re not in the gym then boast of the magic of the coffee/butter/coconut oil without considering maybe it was the exercise and low calorie diet.
8348 2018-12-29 20:44:33 I wonder if we can turn the extra soy beans into bio fuel and tank the coal and oil industry.
8349 2018-12-29 20:44:29 I get fertility solutions, both genuine and snake oil. I think they've noticed out that I'm 38 and buy fun kids' gifts but never any practical kids stuff, and assumed I want to do something about that.
8350 2018-12-29 20:44:27 Every time you take yo car to the shop they always wanna tell you something you didn’t come in for ... naw bitch just change my oil.
8351 2018-12-29 20:44:25 Look to the Future, but bring into it Organic Health & Practices. Watch for Amrit Organic Authentic CBD Therapy Massage oil.
8352 2018-12-29 20:44:15 I tried to take a bath to relax and my skin (on my ass) is having a reaction to the orange oil I put in my bath water.
8353 2018-12-29 20:44:14 Мне понравилось видео "Мои картины маслом и не только. My drawings. Oil painting."
8354 2018-12-29 20:44:09 Wait did someone put sunflower seeds in your oil filter??
8355 2018-12-29 20:44:05 What's more important, the price of a facial oil or the ingredients?
8356 2018-12-29 20:44:00 I just requested, please accept oh. I want to be following people that has oil flowing in their head from now on...
8357 2018-12-29 20:43:58 It hasn’t failed. The company said that it would be able to ship the new oil in December, 2020. I guess will see them
8358 2018-12-29 20:43:51 関西はだいぶ先になってしまいますがぜひ！
8359 2018-12-29 20:43:33 はっやーい
8360 2018-12-29 20:43:30 Andrew, are you a serious politician or an oil industry lobbyist?
8361 2018-12-29 20:43:23  Child & Human Trafficking is BIG BUCKS , no wonder Congressional members "retire" as MILLIONAIRES, every one of them wants a "piece of the pie" literally and monetarily  THEY worship the GODS alright  G = guns, O = oil , D = drugs and 
S = sexual perversion ; SICK 
8362 2018-12-29 20:43:16 No matter how much you hate conservatives it doesn't make it the truth to blame them for the unemployment rate in Alberta. LPC and NDP hold that honor. Our rate is about 7% national 5.6%. If you don't live here or work in the oil industry you have no clue to our problems.
8363 2018-12-29 20:43:07 So is a new tripod of Regional powers #ITI starting to take shape? New era new sponsors  #Iran #Turkey #Israel #geopolitics #eastmediterranean #oil #energy #water #nation #state #ethnic #balance #power #role #Palestine #gulf #tectonic #silk_road where do #arab states fall in?
8364 2018-12-29 20:43:05 Teflon Don...
No need for oil !
8365 2018-12-29 20:43:05 She left me ooo, All ABU n my FAM knew about us 
8366 2018-12-29 20:43:04 Was just now arguing with a trump pleb buying this dip and he thinks oil prices going down is a consumer boon 
8367 2018-12-29 20:43:01 Rubbing Castor oil on your eyebrows actually work?
8368 2018-12-29 20:42:51 The irony of this bs ‘oil money’ attack is that his refusal to take PAC money was a huge part of his appeal.
8369 2018-12-29 20:42:46 I just ordered some beard oil
8370 2018-12-29 20:42:43 My GMAIL in box choked w CBD oil spam.....how do they avoid the otherwise excellent spam filters?
8371 2018-12-29 20:42:42 I drive a mirage I’m good with my matchbox. I already cringe at the price when I get an oil change and standard repairs
8372 2018-12-29 20:42:32 he looks like a robot so maybe he lives off oil
8373 2018-12-29 20:42:28 Oil money all over Texas.  TCU has it.  Houston has it.  Rice has it but they nerds.
8374 2018-12-29 20:42:24 Make no mistake. Man City, current champions, funded by an Oil nation, best coach in the world, De Bruyne, Silva, Aguero, sane, Mahrez, Fernandinho, Sterling, two £50m CBs, Kompany,  >£100m fullbacks, SHOULD win the league

Liverpool have an opportunity, there’s no pressure
8375 2018-12-29 20:42:18 Yeah that's what's gonna happen. I hope all the farmers use weld the engines (empty the oil and run full speed seize the motors) on their farm equipment and pump chemicals in their land before they leave. 
Let Africa be africa.
8376 2018-12-29 20:42:10 What are your plans for getting the horrific law allowing oil corps to drill in the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge REPEALED ? We need a voice !!!!!!! Help us
8377 2018-12-29 20:42:06 Dj Alex en fuel oil?? Buenoooo mepa que se sale ahí si
8378 2018-12-29 20:42:04 There is a type of car you will drive to a fuel station, They will direct you to where they are selling Palm oil 
8379 2018-12-29 20:42:03 i dnt understand.. She left u for her cuz or u are the cuz
8380 2018-12-29 20:42:02 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
8381 2018-12-29 20:41:39 grasienta o pegajosa(? 
a mi no me pasa.. busca uno oil free
8382 2018-12-29 20:41:27 If you publish articles for the public, you open yourself up to criticism... whether anonymously or not.  You need to do more homework, my friend.  Not trying to be antogonistic... but the oil market is the ultimate for counter feedback loops and thus cyclicality.
8383 2018-12-29 20:41:24 Definitely it has. A hearty breakfast i.e 2 slices of whole-wheat bread, one boiled egg and a shami kabab. Lunch is a filet of pan fried fish in like 1tbsp of oil with vegetables. Dinner is usually a chicken tikka.
8384 2018-12-29 20:41:19 Can’t believe the fella in Lush gave me my bath oil for free cos I worked retail over Christmas @LushLtd A*  customer service made my day 
8385 2018-12-29 20:41:08 I think I hide it nicely inside this old oil bath breather  now to drill out a bunch of hidden holes and get the cover flowing more air 
8386 2018-12-29 20:41:03 The 1% of the 1% don't want a well educated Electorate...
Also we must STOP giving $8 billion in subsidies each year to Big Oil...They're established!
8387 2018-12-29 20:40:58 Been two hours and I’m still waiting at the dealership for my oil change 
8388 2018-12-29 20:40:53 Yes o, late 2017, November, I lost myself
8389 2018-12-29 20:40:34 Tofu is great. I don't know many recipes with it, I usually just pan fry pieces in oil. I wonder how it tastes after you press it.
8390 2018-12-29 20:40:34 Lee you only need to look at the name of the author to realise that this will be innacurate. Snake Oil is about as reliable as an Austin Allegro. He resorts to tech solutions that are yet to be proved.
8391 2018-12-29 20:40:31 しっかり防寒していかないといけませんね……。無事終わりますように！
8392 2018-12-29 20:40:28 hes only used baby oil & vaseline to moisturize his body.

I.

am.

speechless.
8393 2018-12-29 20:40:25 ナルルちゃんは素直で可愛いなー。誰かさんもあれぐらい素直だったらいいんだけどなー
8394 2018-12-29 20:40:24 I did. the medium one. 
2 bunches of parsley, 1 bunch of mint, 4 medium sized tomatoes, two white onions, (the mild variety), 150g of bulgur, the juice of 2 lemons (or three!) same amount of water as the lemon juice, salt, pepper, a hint of paprika, olive oil. There you go.
8395 2018-12-29 20:40:16 He's the type of guy that gives snake oil salesmen a lot of self respect.  "I may sell garbage to people, but at least I'm not as shady as the umbrella cartel over there" 

[Umbrella carts are always pulling something shady]
8396 2018-12-29 20:40:13 @TurkishLDN Watched your AFTV intv, well said mate. You knew a manager alone isn't enough. Owners have to spend, and over multiple windows. Only way to keep up nowadays if you don't have oil money.
8397 2018-12-29 20:40:07 世界一サラダ油だと言ってくれ。
8398 2018-12-29 20:40:04 Mas pq nenê
8399 2018-12-29 20:40:00 Unfortunately, Harper's plan to become an 'energy super power' and grossly over dependent on the commodity, oil, has been an economic DISASTER for Alberta. With unemployment at a 40 year low Trudeau has provided the opportunity to diversify away from over-dependence.
8400 2018-12-29 20:39:55 I had a ride in one this summer. If you can imagine being trapped inside an oil barrel with a thousand angry wasps and 20 alarm clocks while being rolled down a cobbled street, it's noisier than that
8401 2018-12-29 20:39:55 Ambition and a relationship = water and oil
8402 2018-12-29 20:39:54 I use Baby oil to remove cause it’s soft on the skin and light, and then wash my face and then I lil oil while it’s still wet to rehydrate the skin
8403 2018-12-29 20:39:50 It never fails. Came in for an oil change/tire rotation & something else is fucked up
8404 2018-12-29 20:39:46 Until you stop taking money from oil and gas you’re part of the trash polluting our climate
8405 2018-12-29 20:39:43 I finally changed my air filter @jiffylube. Now they can stop asking at EVERY oil change
8406 2018-12-29 20:39:42 What point would you consider miners? Do you have any view on oil and if so does that factor in to your bearish miners? Any view on development plays with leverage or royalty companies?
8407 2018-12-29 20:39:35 Afternoon everyone,

Hope your weekend is going great .  If you haven't already, don't forget to follow, and RT for your chance to win 1 of 3 bottles of facial moisturizer oil from J'Karai Bella.  Winners announced on January 1.  Good Luck!
8408 2018-12-29 20:39:26 There’s this older lady at jiffy lube rn is trying to get her oil changed & the guy helping her was so rude . Like she is the sweetest lady & is just trying to ask him a few question & his negativity towards her saddens me . I hope karma bites him in the ass for it .
8409 2018-12-29 20:39:20 Why would you say it isn’t at home? You’re the sort of person who likely supports the Royals and hates immigrants. You’re happy to bomb other countries for oil and destroy homes but not take responsibility for the actions. Prove that our charity isn’t at home
8410 2018-12-29 20:39:20 it has shea butter and olive oil in it, no flax seed... and try mixing the ones you have together and see if you like it 
8411 2018-12-29 20:39:13 Use baby oil
8412 2018-12-29 20:39:08 #RT @SexAdviceBot: Don't forget to always use essential oil before, during, and after sex!
8413 2018-12-29 20:38:54 Baba say engine oil 
8414 2018-12-29 20:38:50 I need a oil change 
8415 2018-12-29 20:38:46 I recall longer winters and in the summer; Butterflies in the daytime and Lghtning Bugs at night were both very common but not anymore.
GMO's are hardly ever mentioned - almost like Oil and Yemen and Oil and Venezuela are not mentioned.
8416 2018-12-29 20:38:42 The big tax should be on imported oil from countries that we don't have trade agreements with. Not on Canadian producers.
8417 2018-12-29 20:38:38 Pizza Salmon
-Salmon
Layer the following on top
-mozzarella cheese
-tomatoes slices (thin)
-olive oil n salt (to taste)
-basil
Bake on foil 325, 55 minutes.
8418 2018-12-29 20:38:37 ENGLAND LIED TO SCOTLAND & STOLE HER OIL.
8419 2018-12-29 20:38:10 Since morning i waiting for my sis to bring me a damn inhaler and some shilling oil ..my allergies crazy since it cold
8420 2018-12-29 20:38:04 When AB oil is more expensive to extract than other sources then you are going down, down, down.  No pipeline will change that.  Diversify, diversify, diversify. Or have you
8421 2018-12-29 20:37:59 Tbh you can't truly "whale" your way through skill level ups and equipment drops/ level ups.
Especially the equipment drops, since it'll always be up to RNG.
There's just people that farm the game stupid fast and whale for Oil. That still takes time.
8422 2018-12-29 20:37:40 ethan and grayson smell like coconut oil
8423 2018-12-29 20:37:38 No, 30 year old sales man I won’t flirt with you but yes I’ll take the free oil change you mentioned lmao 
8424 2018-12-29 20:37:35 Shouts out to tea tree oil, got my hair wild healthy n allat
8425 2018-12-29 20:37:22 And yet you accept money from oil companies that also destroy our land. I guess we don't talk about that. I supported you but I guess you are another establishment dem.
8426 2018-12-29 20:37:01 Also ready for a new home! These would make awesome essential oil storage! Amanda Duran Gray Melissa Kennedy
8427 2018-12-29 20:37:01 Because the oil subsidies would be bigger, there would be no carbon tax or subsidies for renewable energy. Also other things, like lower taxes on the rich then we already have. Listen to me, im NOT saying they are perfect, I’m saying the conservatives are and have been worse
8428 2018-12-29 20:36:53  we go change oil December
8429 2018-12-29 20:36:51 Surely there’s a point at which it’s all absurd though. Fewer people dying of easily prevented diseases made some undertakers and coffin makers redundant. Evidence-based medicine put snake oil salesmen out of business. Not sure this is a productive method for valuing tech.
8430 2018-12-29 20:36:44 Cannabis oil is proving to be quite an effective herbal medicine by the day. Unfortunately several governments still associate it with hard drugs and in the process they lose out on its excellent healing properties. Pity.
8431 2018-12-29 20:36:43 Why is America making a bunch of muslims rich beyond belief in the middle east, from buying their oil? When Venezuela is closer and has even more oil?
8432 2018-12-29 20:36:42 so u get cousine bride?
8433 2018-12-29 20:36:20 Oh no. 

The Christmas cold that I’ve managed to avoid all holiday? The one people around me have suffered through valiantly, stinking of Strepsils and Olbas Oil?

‘Tis upon me. Send help.
8434 2018-12-29 20:36:00 In Texas, oil and natural gas production is not only fueling jobs and the economy, but is also a significant contributor to the state’s education system. 
8435 2018-12-29 20:35:59 Our economy has been propping you lot up. Where, pray tell us, have 45+ years of oil profits gone? We have no oil fund (Norway has 1 trillion) only food banks. Our resources are drained south. Don’t embarrass yourself.
8436 2018-12-29 20:35:55 Oil money for dayz
8437 2018-12-29 20:35:49 Anything i have on hand really ... it still holds but idk i saw this girl on IG suggest it years back and I’ve been hooked on ECO since like i dip my fingers in the gel put oil on top mix together and lay them edges ECO Argan Oil or Flaxseed (the green one) are my favs for edges
8438 2018-12-29 20:35:45 Here’s the thing ... you can either do this for face or do your entire body. Set your bath with some warm to hot water, cup of epsom salt, and a cup of pure apple cider vinegar, add a natural scented oil so it no smell three bad. Soak in it for 30 minutes. Skin reset. 
8439 2018-12-29 20:35:44 They will do anything to prevent the Premier getting credit for advancing the oil industry. Including hurting Alberta.

8444 2018-12-29 20:35:03 The lovely sweet sweetheart cabbage, shredded and fried with onion and garlic and olive oil, some Turkish red pepper paste, then a long slow cook with a touch of chicken stock, perhaps some lamb mince. It's a quality cabbage. Kapushka!
8445 2018-12-29 20:34:40 It is more and more important now that we have an aging Bruce Willis, the space shuttle is decommissioned, and atrophying oil drillers thanks to cheap crude. We can't let Armageddon happen again cc: @sussurro
8446 2018-12-29 20:34:24 Just make sure you oil up the club shafts with Boiled Linseed Oil for at least a few days minimum before you take them out to play. Helps reduce the chance of breakage. Good luck, and welcome to the world of hickories.
8447 2018-12-29 20:34:15 I buy ozs from the dispo for cheap and roll em into joints filled with oil and keef and they last a while!
8448 2018-12-29 20:34:15 I wish I made what it cost to change the oil in those cars but you make it look easy and it's sure wasn't enjoy them black beauties of rides
8449 2018-12-29 20:34:13 Wait, you guys don't find the bank account normal? We need more money management vids and less motor oil pancake vids then
8450 2018-12-29 20:34:09 me: “I wanna go for a run, change my oil, and be productive today.” 

Also me: “OMG The Great British Baking Show! Christmas episodes!!!I’m never leaving the house.”
8451 2018-12-29 20:34:09 Hey Doug - any thought on the pipeline, oil tankers on east coast, cancellations of large projects...you know Canadian stuff? #cdnpoli
8452 2018-12-29 20:34:07 So why do companies like BP keep developing new extraction technologies and investing £Billions into the North Sea development?  Are you suggesting they don't know what they're doing? Are you suddenly the Oil Expert and NP are just stupid to pursue Scottish oil?
8453 2018-12-29 20:33:45 Last I checked, having a child was a personal choice - not an insurable event. It IS called health "insurance" - right?
Why doesn't car insurance cover tires, brakes, oil changes and all maintenance items. Cars would be safer and it would save lives, right? (and cost 10K a year)
8454 2018-12-29 20:33:24 Step 1, end subsidies to oil companies.
8455 2018-12-29 20:32:57 My wish for 2019 is that Black hair and skincare lines come up with formulas that don’t include coconut oil. Thank you.
8456 2018-12-29 20:32:47 I didn’t drink a lot of water or put coconut oil on my belly for 2 days in a row and wow up with stretch marks
8457 2018-12-29 20:32:45 That ermine-gland oil in the crazies from security game.
8458 2018-12-29 20:32:44 Cause that Tumblr you had. Lol Bruh! *gets consecrated oil*
8459 2018-12-29 20:32:39 I don’t know about y’all.... but I’ve never had to wait 4 hours for a damn oil change @Walmart 
8460 2018-12-29 20:32:31 In essence, buying oil from a country who support terrorist activities, you are being part of it, just like @RealTrump2016 who denies the killing of khashoggi because of big financial dealings.
8461 2018-12-29 20:32:31 Actually was reading an article they suggest oil and kosher salt wipe off with paper towel. Season it again after doing this
8462 2018-12-29 20:32:29 You’re more green than most. Your anti oil, anti site C , anti bunker fuel stance is definitely the way forward.
8463 2018-12-29 20:32:25 Hmmmm u did not catch me well, what i mean is islam is not allow any one who is not an educated people to talk. Islam is not alone for me but is for muslims only
8464 2018-12-29 20:32:23 CLAIMS
FIRS remitted over ₦6trillion
JAMB remitted ₦7.8billion
NIMASSA remitted ₦21.8billion
Nigeria Customs brought  ₦1.5trillion
Sales of crude oil brought ₦7trillion.

These sources generated over ₦15 trillion in 2018 yet they can't implement 2018 budget of ₦9trillion
8465 2018-12-29 20:32:23 Went to JiffyLube a few weeks ago for an oil change, and some asshole told me I needed a new battery because it was close to dying.

My dad went to check the battery at a different shop, and the battery is completely fine. Doesn’t need to be replaced. 
8466 2018-12-29 20:32:16 Cbd oil?
8467 2018-12-29 20:32:03 How could one hate someone so much to put sunflower seeds in their oil filter?¿ I just wanna talk 
8468 2018-12-29 20:31:45 Am taking CBD oil to help with it but sometimes these nightmares return, had one about cannibalism last night. Woke up, sick feeling knowing what the  cabal had planned to reduce the population & likely to have included that as a way to eliminate 90% of humans.
8469 2018-12-29 20:31:36 Castor oil is amazing
8470 2018-12-29 20:31:16 Hace mucho lo escuché decir en la tele que le gustaba Midnight Oil... Qué tal escuchar “Beds are burning” para empezar?
8471 2018-12-29 20:31:12 It is money from oil rich countries who do not want India to be a powerful country both economically and militarily. Let Indian public reject those journalists who are castigating Modi to please their pay masters.
8472 2018-12-29 20:31:05 #plfanzone Torreira was looking for crude oil when Firmino scored the second goal.

@KremlinRussia_E
 know, so that just done agreed. That's reason USA hás fighting against Venezuela. Besides also petrol oil matter + high USA public debt + Ásia growth, that's reason USA hás promoting lobby & politics coup in Latin America #lawfare
8474 2018-12-29 20:30:41 Never tried it. What oil do you use?
8475 2018-12-29 20:30:22 'oil it' that should say - no idea where 'point it' came from!
8476 2018-12-29 20:30:10 We know how he accomplished, giving Corporations the power back, but Oil Stock Market just crash too lol  what are coal miner follower gonna do, lol will have lie to employees to work for free hahah.
8477 2018-12-29 20:30:10 Tap into the OIL.  Fan into flames the gift of God in you Timothy.
8478 2018-12-29 20:30:06 Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Avoid anti-dandruff shampoo. Towel dry hair. Is it NISIM or NHB? A shampoo to curb hair loss. or related. What must I do to discover the precise website. Very pleasant. Was sulfate free.
8479 2018-12-29 20:29:59 I really like it with garlic, olive oil and salt on roasted Fingerling Potatoes. Just sayin’.

8481 2018-12-29 20:29:51 1) sauté carrots w/oil/spices ~5 min 2) Add broth/rice/beans and med cook veggies, e.g. sweet potato or butternut, cook on rice fxn 2-3X until cooked (brown takes longer) 3) Add fast cook veggies e.g. green beans, peppers, anything frozen to last cycle or directly to hot stew.
8482 2018-12-29 20:29:51 I left my shea butter AND coconut oil in Dallas. *cries in neo-soul*
8483 2018-12-29 20:29:48 To be fair, the other 2 aren’t no oil paintings.
8484 2018-12-29 20:29:44 Oil prices are rebounding and expected to go up. That won’t help Canada though cause our government has made sure we can’t get our product to market.
8485 2018-12-29 20:29:41 You know our oil industry cannot keep the massive employment of people with gasoline at 1.50/gal. It needs to be closer to 2.25
8486 2018-12-29 20:29:41 Who sells CBD oil on my friends list.  (Not CTFO).
8487 2018-12-29 20:29:29 you can’t name it essential oil and expect me NOT to drink it
8488 2018-12-29 20:29:26 The city of Houston has oil money, but the city doesn’t give two shits about UH. If UH had the kind of big swinging dick oil money that A&M, Texas and even Tech have they wouldn’t be left floundering as a stepping stone job in a G5 conference.
8489 2018-12-29 20:29:25 OIL makes everything run without friction, smoothly.
8490 2018-12-29 20:29:25 I gotta leave that oil alone
8491 2018-12-29 20:29:24 สเปอร์สไม่น่าแพ้ แต่ทางนี้แพ้ไม่แปลกใจ แต่แพ้เยอะไป 5555
8492 2018-12-29 20:28:54 My dog + cow manure @Dads farm. what it took to get the smell off:

V05 shampoo x3 times 
Essentials natural shampoo x3 times
1/2 gallon of Listerine rub down
Tea Tree oil rub down 
Oh yeah this all happened in mom and dads shower, so fun times!  Mom was very patient and helpful.
8493 2018-12-29 20:28:42 We're aw sunflower oil these days eh... Growing up we used lard for anything that was cooked in a frying pan and mazola (or whatever the  equivalent was) for cooking chips. Couldnae tell ye the last time we deep-fried chips on a gas cooker, 30 years ago maybe.
8494 2018-12-29 20:28:24 the most revolutionary thing of 2018: maya debellis teaching me that a salad can be just oil+vinegar+leaf
8495 2018-12-29 20:28:19 The Model 3 has over 10 thousand parts and requires virtually no maintenance. Watch out old vehicle supply chain where everything needs maintenance. That model is dead already, though it's still walking like a zombie, hungry, kind of like the oil nation, Saudi Arabia. Adios.
8496 2018-12-29 20:28:17 Ok, and I'm not saying this to be chauvinistic - but who changes your oil, maintains your vehicle, makes repairs around the house, etc, even if you have to pay to have it done, 90% of the time what gender does it? Women have a much needed skillset and so do men - all I'm saying!
8497 2018-12-29 20:28:12 Put some a cinnamon essential oil in the diffusers. My bedroom and bathroom are about to be smellin hella good
8498 2018-12-29 20:28:03 @Maximuscle noticed some of your produce contain palm oil any clues where that is sourced from?
8499 2018-12-29 20:27:52 Look at how he painted the light hitting the doctors’ scrubs in the surgery paintings. This artist is super dope at oil painting IMO. Maybe Jesus is helping him paint... #meta
8500 2018-12-29 20:27:41 Okay. That accounts for a reduction from $1.20 to $1.16 per litre when the policy was instituted. Why are @VictorFedeli and @fordnation taking credit for the remaining reduction as a result of global price fluctuations of crude oil (at historical lows).
8501 2018-12-29 20:26:47 You can actually go to about 5000. Before you need a change around 3500 I would add some oil in because it’s probably low otherwise don’t waste the money
8502 2018-12-29 20:26:34 Yeah, still. Sometimes mine last a few days. But thanks for the reminder about peppermint oil. I never remember which one it is!
8503 2018-12-29 20:26:19 100% flim flam, Trump is America’s greatest ever snake oil salesman!    A seedy profiteers trying to exploit an unsuspecting public by selling it fake cures. In fact, the Oxford English Dictionary defines snake oil as "a quack remedy or panacea."
8504 2018-12-29 20:26:17 So our cooking oil spray thing could take 20 or 30 hard fast pumps. But you could feel the pressure starting to build fairly quickly.
8505 2018-12-29 20:26:16 ヒヨコが3種類も(*∩ω∩)
8506 2018-12-29 20:26:13 I will use it to buy rice n vegetable oil
8507 2018-12-29 20:26:13 The price of oil is down about 40% from peak. The price of gas from peak is down too. Factor in winter blend fuel and the price of gas is actually more expensive - but yes, keep pushing this narrative of cheaper fuel when  simple math is proving you wrong.
8508 2018-12-29 20:26:06 Did the Liberals promise the oil exec's  that they would cut regulations?
8509 2018-12-29 20:26:02 Got my oil change for a third of the price 
8510 2018-12-29 20:25:47 How about lamp light dinner? 
Use as many small, oil fueled lamps as needed, which are not only reusable & natural but also clean, safe & serene.
You don't have to blow it off, & in our culture we light a lamp, not blow it off.
A blend of Western culture and our culture, huh?
8511 2018-12-29 20:25:46 I have a 2011 eqinox. Head gasket has to be replaced about every 50K miles. My timing chain had to be replaced at 50k. Wth. They already replaced top of engine supposed. Oil consumption has already started again. Transmission control module replaced at 95k. Melted.
8512 2018-12-29 20:25:41 As long as oil flows on you, you will always slip from your deadly enemies!
8513 2018-12-29 20:25:34 More so, our neighbour USA, China, India and Pakistan are the biggest polluters that you should be focusing on  not Canada who have the most environment sense of extracting oil. P.S.refresh my memory of how did you get that job?
8514 2018-12-29 20:25:28 I’m incredibly horny for oil paint but I’m not into being covered in the stuff for a solid 6 months so I guess I just won’t
8515 2018-12-29 20:25:26 Buy gold. The pension fund crisis is coming. And the oil price is going to bounce with Feds raising rates twice and threat of tax cut reversal in 2020. Buy GLD.
8516 2018-12-29 20:25:17 Oh my days, only one shea moisture line worked for me & that’s, unshockingly, the Jamaican castor oil line. I gave up on store bought products tbh, life’s been sweet since.
8517 2018-12-29 20:25:15 Pull up to my job for an oil change and found out i got a raise
8518 2018-12-29 20:24:46 The same, but it’s really complicated by the fact I have recently travelled to Malaysia and seen tiny villages that rely on palm oil production 
8519 2018-12-29 20:24:41 Lmao .. But it's OK to import foreign oil and refine it in NS by Irving. What a joke you Liberal con artists are!
8520 2018-12-29 20:24:38 Get thc oil xox
8521 2018-12-29 20:24:35 Oil changes killing me 
8522 2018-12-29 20:24:23 Yu ever tried adding an oil to it ?  It helps if you have flaking
8523 2018-12-29 20:24:22 [Hastily rips up the canvas of the oil painting I prepared]
8524 2018-12-29 20:24:21 I need brakes, roaders, tires, and an oil change. I think it’s time to trade the Jeep off 
8525 2018-12-29 20:24:20 Sesame oil really is that bitch

8529 2018-12-29 20:24:03 Using my brothers beard oil for my edges because why not? Lmaooo if this thing works, we moveee 
8530 2018-12-29 20:24:03 Facts! That new creame of nature line the Moroccan Argon oil is where it’s at though
8531 2018-12-29 20:24:00 Houston doesn’t have any oil money. You sure?
8532 2018-12-29 20:23:52 Tea tree oil saves lives
8533 2018-12-29 20:23:48 Girl drink you some castor oil & mix it with food. I did, Kadyn was born 4 hours later!
8534 2018-12-29 20:23:46 What you gonna do when you need the lithium from South America & they decide to keep it South of the wall. Oil is on its way out fella
8535 2018-12-29 20:23:46 I’d love to hear your solution to help Alberta bring its oil industry to full potential.

If it’s capitulating to Trudeau......

Then you would be wrong.
8536 2018-12-29 20:23:42 Wayau ne kawai
8537 2018-12-29 20:23:40 According to Moody’s, the outlook for Norway’s banking system is negative, as the rating agency expects declining oil investments and persistently low oil prices to adversely affect the domestic operating environment.
8538 2018-12-29 20:23:36 My dog only eats cooked chicken w olive oil & rices this mthfkr will starve no matter what i feed him
8539 2018-12-29 20:23:36 They fear Pelosi which is apparent... the lady is smarter than any damn Republican in Congress and she brings it with a smile... Mitch McConnell only knows how to play dirty because he’s slick as a can of oil and crooked as a winding road!
8540 2018-12-29 20:23:31 Sirotas piece wasn't a smear. It was an examination of Betos record, his breaking a pledge to not take oil/gas money and how his campaign is financed. It's not a coordinated effort by many to smear one person. That's why you can only cite one article. Care more.
8541 2018-12-29 20:23:23 Yes there's oil off Palawan & gas, but Food security too, point I showed to late Rod Reyes and Ferdie Ramos years ago w a unbaked hook catch
8542 2018-12-29 20:23:20 アザっす！
8543 2018-12-29 20:23:15 When society collapses I'm really going to miss olives and olive oil
8544 2018-12-29 20:23:13 Ready to try something new? Our Nurturing Rose Shampoo & Conditioner contains a moisturising blend of coconut & olive oil for healthy hair!
8545 2018-12-29 20:23:08 So I love you NDP. I campaigned for you. But there's no nastier Twitter than when I raise my legit concerns about their support for the oil and gas industry and I get blow back from people telling me to shut up.
8546 2018-12-29 20:23:02 Lash growth serum and hair skin and nail vitamins!! Also castor oil at night on your lashes. It took my lashes awhile but they’re finally full again!
8547 2018-12-29 20:22:54 いやー今回ばかりは逃げるとかうんぬんではなく、ゲームでトップとる人に会えたのは最高でした！
8548 2018-12-29 20:22:50 Finally getting an oil change after basically just completely disregarding it for idk how long . My brother called me like “ go get your oil changed”
8549 2018-12-29 20:22:49 Maybe Roy can answer this. I just know you’re supposed to wipe it clean and use oil to season it.
8550 2018-12-29 20:22:49 That was not Harper’s responsibility. Oil prices were higher and causing the hi prices at the pump.
8551 2018-12-29 20:22:20 Notley's assertion that the oil and gas industry is an inherent right for all Albertans is colonialist and forgets the fact that the tar sands pollute and destroy Indigenous territory.

It's uncomfortable but you can't look away. We need a just transition off  oil and gas.
8552 2018-12-29 20:22:18 It will never work, kinda like oil and water!!
8553 2018-12-29 20:22:15 Oil money
8554 2018-12-29 20:22:08 Oof. The oil... 
8555 2018-12-29 20:22:06 indonesia menempati Peringkat 2 dalam karet alam (Natural Rubber) dan minyak sawit mentah (Crude Palm Oil).
8556 2018-12-29 20:22:05 Le shampoing Shea Moisture de la gamme low porosity est validé. La différence est clairement net avec Jamaican black castor oil qui est clarifiant et assèche les cheveux dès le rinçage
8557 2018-12-29 20:21:57 But perhaps #Brexit negotiations have opened their eyes. Scot with a finger hold in EU v Scotland leaving with all oil and gas rights?? It's what the English economy is built on whereas Scottish economy is more balanced. We'd be in a great position if @theSNP would get on with it
8558 2018-12-29 20:21:45 Thanks, Barcott--and fyi 'swanning' was borrowed from, I believe, a Hersh story about an oil con man in Kazakhstan. Have wanted to use it ever since.
8559 2018-12-29 20:21:42 RTAinJapanを観戦しにいってお会いしました！

爽やかな人で最高でした！
8560 2018-12-29 20:21:39 UH doesn’t have oil money. They have chain restaurant money.
8561 2018-12-29 20:21:21 my mom got an oil diffuser for Christmas and now she refuses to call it anything other than her vape
8562 2018-12-29 20:21:18 Still, Ana? Sometimes peppermint oil helps me when I have a bad headache.
8563 2018-12-29 20:21:15 《オリーブ油豆知識》

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
8564 2018-12-29 20:21:12 It's identical to the face my cat gave me when I offered them a sardine in lemon pepper sauce.

I returned to buying them in oil, as she preferred.
8565 2018-12-29 20:21:06 Sure but it’s nothing compared to oil and coal
8566 2018-12-29 20:21:04 It’s amazing, and I’ve only cooked chicken breast! Lol it was crunchy too! No oil, no flour, just seasoning
8567 2018-12-29 20:20:54 Trying to figure out which essential oils would be best for labor. I’m bringing my oil/wax warmer and I wanna make sure I bring the right stuff
8568 2018-12-29 20:20:53 Now now... Rape is what oil & construction workers do. Pillaging is what the Liberals excel at
8569 2018-12-29 20:20:27 Yes, that's true. The EPA is not perfect. But the pendulum has swung too far to the right and in the last two years it has been all about protecting coal and oil. So, not only has the USA backed away from climate change but also basic environmental issues.
8570 2018-12-29 20:20:20 I been puttin sooo much fuckinn oil in blunts that when i roll a roach L shit tastes like straight dabs 
8571 2018-12-29 20:20:19 Kyle took my car to get the oil changed and filled my gas tank while Im at work. Damn, I got a good man.
8572 2018-12-29 20:20:15 Been pretty lazy today, but I did one productive thing: I fixed an oil leak that has been bugging me on my Subaru for ages. If I would have known how easy it would be to fix I would have done it much sooner.
8573 2018-12-29 20:20:15 Listening to the ring cycle. Most probably needs some oil.
8574 2018-12-29 20:20:10 Si estoy leyendo correctamente, ahí no dice “como se llama.” Así que si esa es la pregunta, mejor escriban “como se llama.” Y se llama “oil dipstick.”

8576 2018-12-29 20:19:38 Can’t wait to run my man a shower pour oil on the floor then beat him with a belt 
8577 2018-12-29 20:19:37 That would be of great assistance to Scotland.  Could you leave the union before 29th March as that would save us having to be fast tracked back into the EU?

If you need to buy electricity, water, oil, gas, fish, beef etc. call us (assuming you have a trade deal with the EU.)
8578 2018-12-29 20:19:35 Free tuition for oil field workers to retrain them to a more sustainable industry or relocation assistance to part of country that needs labour I.e. Quebec which is short on 117k jobs.
8579 2018-12-29 20:19:29 I beg to differ!! Just use One n Only Argan Oil Purple ..or neon purple. Of course make sure your hairs bleached first. Its amazing. Trust.
8580 2018-12-29 20:19:29 @cathmckenna your @liberal_party already ruin Alberta whom to date still struggling in the oil and gas industry, why not stop buying oil from Saudi who don't have a program about climate change and they are using oil money for terrorist activities...
8581 2018-12-29 20:19:25 Almost 4 years since #CriticalRole began, and I’ve finally met another Critter in the wild. Not at a con, or at anything gamer related, while getting my oil changed.
8582 2018-12-29 20:19:21 Platts and Argus closed. I don’t know anyone in oil who will come in. Maybe the natural gas and power traders.
8583 2018-12-29 20:19:15 Too tight fi go in try oil it up! Underneath clean and tidy uppp
8584 2018-12-29 20:19:12 me: he’s dead.

8587 2018-12-29 20:18:22 Correction, CBD oil
8588 2018-12-29 20:18:10 As far as unemployment goes tell that to the 100,000 or so people out of work and many who have lost their homes because our oil is landlocked. And don't forget over 80,000 non productive, tax burning civil service jobs were added under Notely in the last 3 and a half years
8589 2018-12-29 20:18:08 Sweat, Oil, Lawn Clippings, Shaving Cream... Who knows all the possible ingredients!

yikes.
8593 2018-12-29 20:17:48 I know oil before the game after tweeting 'coyg'  would have sat on his sofa and be like

8595 2018-12-29 20:17:24 Good thing I live near an oil refinery.
8596 2018-12-29 20:17:19 @realDonaldTrump does not give a damn about ordinary working Americans.  He only cares about @realDonaldTrump.  He is a scam artist!  A snake oil salesman.  Don't be a fooled by this PHONEY Baloney!
8597 2018-12-29 20:17:15 I forgot the name of the setting spray i use i got it from ulta though. Snd i think the foundation i use is oil free I’m not sure. I use a sponge to blend everything in
8598 2018-12-29 20:17:11 Drink water and buy some peppermint oil
8599 2018-12-29 20:17:06 I got an oil diffuser for Christmas and I’m OBSESSED.
8600 2018-12-29 20:17:03 The part that really amazes me is how @fordnation also managed to cut gas prices for the rest of Canada! Absolutely amazing! It can’t have anything do with lower world oil prices, can it? No, it MUST be all Doug’s doing. #sarcasm #DougIsAnEmbarassment
8601 2018-12-29 20:16:53 2% jobs rate is bad all job is for oil companies that no American will ever work in. All good jobs was created by Liberals. Blue State will fight protect our Mother Earth and GOP all want do is protect Corporations money. American ppl lose.
8602 2018-12-29 20:16:53 Me: kids I’m getting pizza  

Zaden: I want cheese daddy

Niya: I want Subway, Italian bread, salami, pepperoni, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, oil, vinegar 

Me: so ramen noodles it is 
8603 2018-12-29 20:16:50 You sound like a bot.

I guess The Office for Environmental Justice (Which is under the EPA) isn't needed

Ya know--the regulatory agency that says companies can't do things like put an oil refinery by a PoC neighborhood

Keep trying to dunk on her I guess. Seems to be working 
8604 2018-12-29 20:16:37 I mixed extra dark Jamaican castor oil, shea butter oil, olive, amd avacado oil We'll see what happens..
8605 2018-12-29 20:16:31 Like water and oil.
8606 2018-12-29 20:16:25 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;

8609 2018-12-29 20:16:12 when me and paul started dating a couple weeks in my car broke down and he called aaa and came to accompany me while we waited another when he was at work his family came and got me and towed my car. he does my oil changes and fixes everything. idk what i’d do without him.
8610 2018-12-29 20:16:07 Anyway, that's just oil and blood.

What about nukes?

The real killer.

8614 2018-12-29 20:15:57 One nation is weaponizing fiat against all the others, physical gold is the Achilles heel of that fiat.

In next crisis it will be “time to call”; when that time comes, Gold trumps fiat.  Always has, always will.

If you have gold, oil, & nukes, you control your own destiny.

8620 2018-12-29 20:15:35 Don't forget to always use essential oil before, during, and after sex!

8622 2018-12-29 20:15:04 So the event will only last two weeks? Got to save up on oil and gold then.
8623 2018-12-29 20:14:58 I'm on the fence about neem oil and Diatomaceous earth. Beer actually works for slugs.

8627 2018-12-29 20:14:25 oil flame inserts their spider
8628 2018-12-29 20:14:19 I’ve been thrown the stereotypical “you only pay for oil changes because you’re a girl and don’t know how” a lot in my life. But...I would like it to be known that I’ve sat in a lot of waiting rooms while my car is being worked on and I’m always in here with men. Always men.
8629 2018-12-29 20:14:19 Changes his oil himself.
8630 2018-12-29 20:14:17 Trump dont waist money or steal oil.
8631 2018-12-29 20:14:00 This is why oil change take 2 hours.
8632 2018-12-29 20:13:55 Syria has been a historical alley for Russia/USSR. Plus, just like Crimea, Russia has had a naval base for decades along the Latakia coast. They use this for oil/arm shipment deliveries into the Middle East and beyond.

8642 2018-12-29 20:13:00 Actually, what struck me about "Fear" is Trump's complaint that wars aren't making money for the US; that we should be seizing oil, minerals, whatever would pay.
8643 2018-12-29 20:12:59 S/o the the girl that just let me hit her oil pen at my job lmao gang shit
8644 2018-12-29 20:12:54 Niggas ain’t put no oil or vinegar on my sandwich last night I was mad as hell
8645 2018-12-29 20:12:50 What are you jibber-jabbering about? The MSM is now responsible for Donald Trump being a hypocrite? Not surprised. With acolytes like you, it’s no wonder Trump is the snake oil salesman turned President.

8650 2018-12-29 20:12:40 Venezuela is a failure of capitalism.Dutch Disease: reliance on 1 export&too much on imports bought w/wealth of that export:oil. On top of that, the % of the economy in pvt hands has only increased. Social democratic policies in a fundamentally capitalist system is not socialism.
8651 2018-12-29 20:12:35 ありがとうございますー、機を逃すとなかなか出ないので嬉しいです。
8652 2018-12-29 20:12:34 Nothing useful will have happened for first 3 years due to underpricing. Then everyone goes back to the drawing board. Big Oil negotiates 3 more years of underpricing. It's a win-win situ–  No wait, what...?
8653 2018-12-29 20:12:29 I’m be honest with you bruh all I used  was Ogx anti breakage keratin oil conditioner & wave by design define & shine 2 in 1 dry finishing lotion

My car was not leaking oil before it went in yesterday. I now have a car I can’t drive and have to pay to have it fixed elsewhere

8657 2018-12-29 20:12:11 Thus I’ve had to obtain a medical cannabis card. I’ve never cared for pot, and still don’t. I only use it when I get bad headaches, and when the spasms are so bad, I can’t move. I use the lowest THC and highest CBD I can get.  I also vape CBD oil and use CBD gummies...>
8658 2018-12-29 20:12:03 Lol. As fancy as you can be for scented oil air fragrance

8661 2018-12-29 20:11:27  well, no encouraging words for that. Oil changes still suck, lol
8662 2018-12-29 20:11:24 Oh my goodness, you’re too nice! Thank you- Diet, is fairly decent lol and my parents are lovely people lol! I’ve been trying out different facial oil. As for the hair, I’m so tired of straightening it cause it’s so thick. I really just want braids.
8663 2018-12-29 20:11:00 if I ever truly snap its probably going to be like that bitch in the name of olive oil and oregano

8666 2018-12-29 20:10:52 I put peppermint oil in my conditioner and my head feels like heaven 
8667 2018-12-29 20:10:51 What niche episode in history would you change the outcome of, if given the chance? 

e.g. for this q my on-again, off-again belief that Nigeria never should have been constructed wouldn’t work, but say, choosing not to concentrate the oil refineries outside of the south would
8668 2018-12-29 20:10:51 Yup went in for an oil change did the 48k service and $220 later I’m out lol!
8669 2018-12-29 20:10:51 Yes. Carbon pricing can work. if it's done properly.  If oil sands companies, & other major emitters, continue getting massive subsidies, special perks, their infrastructure+innovation paid for with tax $, and are allowed to self-report their emissions, it's all just a con game.
8670 2018-12-29 20:10:50 But Norway banked more of its oil wealth, it could as its population is only 4.5 million and it kept taxes high. The U.Ks oil cash did not stay in Scotland but was shared among 65 million, some of this wealth was used to keep our taxes lower for years.
8671 2018-12-29 20:10:46 It is good if you are buying oil stocks.
8672 2018-12-29 20:10:37 she put soooooo much oil in the pan...I'm actually shook by the grease to vegetables ratio

8680 2018-12-29 20:09:10 Oil. We still use oil.
8681 2018-12-29 20:09:08 I am at my most vulnerable at instant oil change stations when they yell at me to check my blinkers and lights.

8683 2018-12-29 20:08:58 How are we to survive climate change with increased oil production?
8684 2018-12-29 20:08:48 People from Alberta do not have a problem keeping up with the facts. The fact is we had a conservative prime minister for nine years who never build a pipeline to the West Coast freeing Alberta oil. Trudeau would have had nothing to cancel if Harper had done his job!!
8685 2018-12-29 20:08:45 She can respond if she wants I'm just making sure she is aware that she is wasting her time responding to a JoJo tank full of contaminated oil  so she does it willingly rather than unknowingly
8686 2018-12-29 20:08:11 No dejes de seguir al movimiento #extincionrebelion , un grito contra las élites políticas y económicas , que gobiernan contra intereses ciudadanos , puros negacionistas del cambio climático y la realidad del peak oil, lucha  contra este tipo de liderazgo.
8687 2018-12-29 20:08:09 I imagine the problem of an affordable heat source has been there forever in Siberia. Cry me a river. Um, vast numbers of people don't live at the north pole....and most live near the equator. The reality is this: the globe is awash in oil and gas; supply is endless...
8688 2018-12-29 20:08:03 I honestly don’t rate CBD oil at all. Been taking it for months now, my heads still screwed up & my arms still fucked!? Works miracles my arse.
8689 2018-12-29 20:08:00 The first 2 years will have no effect at all. Arguably the 3rd year will also have no effect. That's 3 years out of 12 wasted. Yet again Big Oil wins.
8690 2018-12-29 20:07:57 So glad I don’t have to pay for oil changes & shit!

8693 2018-12-29 20:07:25 Most of us are talking about gradual reductions in oil production and transportation capacity. You consistently equate this with advocating for immediate use of an all-electric transportation system. Can you see your own fallacy there?
8694 2018-12-29 20:07:23 確かに  東にしますかね
8695 2018-12-29 20:07:15 Nowadays that low calorie breakfast of 2 eggs has become a high calorie bomb of coffee, butter and coconut oil because some douchebag snake oil salesman(Dave Asprey) fooled a bunch of people into believing he actually knows what he’s talking about. Pathetic as fuck.
8696 2018-12-29 20:07:11 Lets get rid of oil made plastics, there is biodegradable hemp can be substituted for plastic products. Enough of oil barons getting rich and fucking up the environment.

8703 2018-12-29 20:06:36 But is this brand packed in water okay?  I feed different brands to my cats but they don't like any packed in oil.  I wouldn't want to feed GMO stuff to my boys!
8704 2018-12-29 20:06:16 The oil tanker reference made me think of that. Haven't come across that piece of villainy in recent times. Hackers are so much more environmentally conscious nowadays
8705 2018-12-29 20:06:03 The crux of the matter is revenue. Our revenue is too low. Save all you want, but oil can only barely cover recurrent. This is the holy grail for us. 

If you’re projected to run deficits till forever like we are now, your savings will be gone in a flash
8706 2018-12-29 20:05:44 coconut oil is always either rock solid or completely liquid, i think it hates me:(( idk how did u do this
8707 2018-12-29 20:05:41 Children? Wow. I thought the line was crossed when they started working with Al Qaeda. We need to get off oil and move to renewables so we can stop enriching these disgusting people.
8708 2018-12-29 20:05:18 Remember when Trump was furious US left Iraq "without the oil"? How about Syria?
8709 2018-12-29 20:05:14 I've noticed a lot of Albertans/Conservatives complain about lack of tar sands/oil field jobs.

You know there's a clean-up of tailing ponds estimated to cost well over 50 billion dollars?
Go get your jobs.

8713 2018-12-29 20:04:54 what does the oil has to do with an argument like this? always bringing shit out of football when you have nothing else to say typical liverpool fans
8714 2018-12-29 20:04:53 Yeah a carrier oil dilutes the oil like jojoba coconut oil almond oil and such
8715 2018-12-29 20:04:51 Dunno why you say that as plenty of those on the list are members of the EU. Separate from being oil rich or a tax haven or American that seems to be the best indicator.
8716 2018-12-29 20:04:51 tbh tho yeah while i'm not necessarily a complete conformist on pizza structure i think it at least needs sauce and cheese to qualify and so Bread With Olive Oil And Basil?? like even if u call the olive oil sauce. no cheese
8717 2018-12-29 20:04:40 The oil embargo, Oct. 1973. $3 to $12 by March 1974 
8718 2018-12-29 20:04:40 This happened in 2017 so not sure why it's coming up now.  Barton worked for Big Oil when he decided to run for Rep from TX.  He was the Chair of Energy Committee while in Congress.  That is the big story here; more corruption in @GOP politics.

8721 2018-12-29 20:04:18 BT talking aba how we’ve been able to shop at Harrods there. We’ve been able to do that without oil money because we have clever people at the top who made transfer profits over the last couple of years. The Reds are coming up the hill... 
8722 2018-12-29 20:04:16 This cycle will always happen till a President is ready to break it, small increase in oil price will mean increase in subsidy payments (see what happened since 2016)

Drop in oil price will mean our currency will have to be defended with reserves or allowed to take a hit.

If you don't have an enemy, make one, the military needs your fear to survive.
8733 2018-12-29 20:03:08 When I got that “oil change” I also took your bff to get her nails done the same color as yours. You thought it was a “coincidence” on snapchat.. And she helped me pick out your flowers I gotchu for when you got off work.. Keep tryin boo

8741 2018-12-29 20:02:23 Yeah, because at the time you were born, the oil money hasn't come yet and act like supporting the club since you're a semen. Learn how to argue like a man.
8742 2018-12-29 20:02:23 I got to this stupid shop at 9:30 for my oil change and I am still here waiting for it to be done 
8743 2018-12-29 20:02:17 >see, so I'm not gonna be happy with it if I leave it as it is anyway. But if I do dye it I need to do the coconut oil thing for four hours beforehand to protect my hair, and that means energy earlier in the day and then sitting upright for four hours and... I had quite a lot of>
8744 2018-12-29 20:02:15 I will write one up . Its easy .meanwhile many sites offer #HowTo make salves or lotion.  I spent Christmas making salves for my family . Keep an eye out for a cold press carrier oil of choice and use therapeutic grade oils like doterra oils. I add FSO CBD isolates to my salves.

8747 2018-12-29 20:01:44 This guy’s a piece of work. This pic is from 2017. He is an “oil and energy” man. Said the fund that BP Oil had to set up to help victims of their oil spill was a shakedown. Says global warming is actually good for us.

8751 2018-12-29 20:01:34 Don't forget the annoited oil. Lol

8755 2018-12-29 20:00:59 Conservative can defend Harper all they want. The bottom line is he failed miserably to build a west coast pipeline freeing Alberta oil.  Unfortunately this will hurt Alberta for many years . If Harper had done his job, we would not be blaming Trudeau for no pipeline

8766 2018-12-29 20:00:01 How to remove oil from a driveway: Cover with sand let stand for a few days, then sweep off.
8767 2018-12-29 19:59:39 So I just cleaned my beauty sponges with olive oil and dish soap and they look brand new wow lol
8768 2018-12-29 19:59:34 It's not a whataboutism, it's a simple choice. Alberta can stay oil rich OR we can start dealing with the most damaging effects of climate change. Can't have both. #cdnpoli
8769 2018-12-29 19:59:34 There’s this oil stuff you can order but idk if it works
8770 2018-12-29 19:59:29 I reiterate—eat shit. Get off your high horse. Your life here on Turtle Island would be awfully dismal without oil and gas. The world isn't weaning off oil, more people than ever are reliant on it for their high standard of living.

8774 2018-12-29 19:58:51 Why are you in Alabama, but olive oil that’s it lol  
8775 2018-12-29 19:58:48 Keep drinking the snake oil. This is about Trump. Stop trying to deflect the issue onto others. There was an agreement in place that addressed border security (passed by both the GOP and Dems). Your boy turned his back on all of them.
8776 2018-12-29 19:58:40 All of those things can be done without the use of coal and oil
8777 2018-12-29 19:58:39 Wait til they find out its oil money.
8778 2018-12-29 19:58:36 Yep, rich off dead young bodies and wealthy off guard duty at oil fields
8779 2018-12-29 19:58:35 We would rather pay more for #alberta oil!! NO MORE SAUDI OIL THIS IS BULLSHIT
8780 2018-12-29 19:58:33 frank pussy having bitch ass, making a big deal out of some meat i dropped bc when he clean oil he leave the machine off & it was almost lunchtime so i just dropped it without a time but i knew how long they cook, he just bitched out to me!
8781 2018-12-29 19:58:22 I call it my "thinking oil", but "vice" sounds cool too...
8782 2018-12-29 19:58:05 Do they really your votes to win?  PDP will not use your oil? Or the one they mismanaged for 16 years is not your so called oil. I pity you bro.

8785 2018-12-29 19:57:47 Why don't we put our minds together and let the South Arabia fighting their own War. We could live without that oil but can you live without the food coming from South America.
8786 2018-12-29 19:57:46 College students don't have oil reserves and lowering student debt doesn't make Erik Prince money basically.
8787 2018-12-29 19:57:43 What are the chances that the other 3% are funded by mining/oil companies.
8788 2018-12-29 19:57:16 All of them from top to bottom are mad..Woke up to an account maintainance charge from @Sterling_Bankng  this morning..Maybe na engine oil abi oil filter dem dy change for the account I have no idea..Useless people

8791 2018-12-29 19:57:01 I try to go really light on them when I do use them and only do it as needed. Then I do hot oil treatments before I co wash my hair so to get the extra out. But I definitely need some help myself. These products they target for “us” don’t always work 
8792 2018-12-29 19:57:01 can’t wait to run my man a shower, pour oil on the floor, then beat him w/ a belt 
8793 2018-12-29 19:56:44 My mom gave my dad CBD oil last night and he’s still knocked out
8794 2018-12-29 19:56:26 It's time for new shoes when your old pair grip like oil
8795 2018-12-29 19:56:22 They can lose the cash, no problemo. Had they given the grand to some deserving person(s), it'd be different! Of course, defining "deserving" would difficult! I could use it - for food & fuel oil!
8796 2018-12-29 19:56:16 Oh wow enough energy to power 3 homes!! It only cost 5 billion to construct with oil royalties. Good job Denmark!
8797 2018-12-29 19:56:08 The antivaxx snake oil MMS is make from poisonus bleach which they give to children in enemas and to drink   Antivaxx dont have a problem abusing their autistic kids with it.  The bleach pushers make huge dollars from it and then they lie about vaccines.
8798 2018-12-29 19:56:04 Oil dey my head oo
8799 2018-12-29 19:55:55 My father cured his cancer with turmeric, ginger, beets, fruit and veggie filled smoothies. Also, vitamin b17, apricot seeds and CBD oil....
8800 2018-12-29 19:55:46 I love my short hair but I feel like my scalp gets so much drier and itchier now. I want to dunk my head in a bucket of tea tree oil. #Halp
8801 2018-12-29 19:55:43 I have a oil leak and instead of getting actual oil changes I let that shit get low enough to where I can go buy cheap oil from the store and fill it up myself. Also my window picks and chooses when it wants to work so 
8802 2018-12-29 19:55:30 That would've cut into the the oil companies profits
8803 2018-12-29 19:55:22 Are there ANY core principles you are not willing to compromise?
8804 2018-12-29 19:55:19 Apparently someone is speaking of what they know nothing coal plants emite very little.Coal converted to fuel oil clean fuel oil that is almost 0 Germany uses fuel oil clean burning you want electrical cars etc where do you thin the power will come Stop making ignorant statements
8805 2018-12-29 19:55:16 I tried to tell a joke at breakfast that you should always replace the head gasket when you change your oil and everyone thought I was being serious.. delivery is everything.

8807 2018-12-29 19:55:06 Look, we should all just accept Texas' version of a progressive. Sure he'll  probably appoint oil people to the energy department but I'm betting he'll put at least one gay person in his staff of speech writers and that gay dude will totally slip in some progressive language.
8808 2018-12-29 19:55:03 The over-processed aspect of seed oils is that the Vitamin E complex (alpha, beta, gamma & delta) collected by vacuum distillation from the deodorised distillate - a by-product of refining - is then added BACK to the refined oil. Bit of a faff!
8809 2018-12-29 19:54:55 So convenient! Oil money from South South doing wonders
8810 2018-12-29 19:54:38 (it's weird how I feel like that about having a twitter drawing, but not AN OIL PAINTING ON A HORSE)
8811 2018-12-29 19:54:36 It's not only right that big oil pays for past emissions, but necessary. They use forgiveness with carbon tax as a strategy to slow  the transition off fossil fuels.
8812 2018-12-29 19:54:27 1 They do get paid.
2 Scotland will be welcomed into EFTA/EU . As the uk will be a 3rd country they will no longer feel the need to be silent about our political situation (No more holding back)
3 Different type of oil. It’s a bit more nuanced than just “oil”.
8813 2018-12-29 19:54:16 The calculation is done bi-annually, not 5 yrs.  The EQz conceptually is not really a problem, but it seems to lack timeliness.  Tough to be current, especially when the bottom drops out of the oil markets with snap of a finger.    All provs should be equally calculated as well.
8814 2018-12-29 19:54:14 Today's weather, slush and fog. My Fibro is loving it. I feel I need an oil can to WD40 my bones and muscles. Then I could just slide around with ease. #sicknotweak #migraine #ChronicPain #Fibromyalgia
8815 2018-12-29 19:54:09 In addition, you quote heavily OCI Oil Change International. Which I see receives funds from the Tides Foundation and if you’d like to go down this rabbit hole, let’s do it Mr.Wagner. Bring it!
8816 2018-12-29 19:53:48 Y’all. Some lady is FaceTiming her adult daughter from the 80% off Christmas decor aisle and two aisles over a little just exclaimed “look mama an oil rig!” 
Real on brand here at Hobby Lobby in Elk City America.
8817 2018-12-29 19:53:40 I leave my niece for 5 minutes and she got into coconut oil and put it all in her hair 
8818 2018-12-29 19:53:36 Popcorn. And I mean just corn which you have to make on oil/other fat, add salt and butter & enjoy it as we did years ago before bitcoin and microwaves 
8819 2018-12-29 19:53:26 @rex_rexchapman if I hear one more person compare Herro to the GREAT KING Rex I think I’ll just spit nails!! Herro is fine, but put away the anointing oil just yet! 
8820 2018-12-29 19:53:23 Tell Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria to get it from Saudi Arabia because that's why we are there anyway. They got more money than any one. I can live without their oil, can you live without the food that's coming from South America.
8821 2018-12-29 19:53:12 Use tea tree oil you noob
8822 2018-12-29 19:53:12 Lol toh Rahma yar kudu ya akayi bakisan ofada ba
8823 2018-12-29 19:53:10 People like you are trying to turn our country into a third world country. All the while importing dirty oil from countries with Human Rights abuses.
8824 2018-12-29 19:53:02 I used to believe that too but oil stays at the surface and does not do anything. Once you throw the water away, the oil goes down the drain as well without doing anything. Adding butter at the end of the cooking process is what helps the pasta not stick together
8825 2018-12-29 19:52:48 That is great news! Fewer rigs mean less oil production and slower global warming. Thanks for sharing!
8826 2018-12-29 19:52:40 Oil Changes be like On the sign $19.99 On the bill $73.88
8827 2018-12-29 19:52:38 If this is true... I'm using my mum's oil ooo
8828 2018-12-29 19:52:30 To fight the #war in #Yemen, #SaudiArabia has used its vast oil wealth to outsource the war, mainly by hiring what Sudanese soldiers say are tens of thousands of desperate survivors of the conflict in #Darfur to fight, many of them #children.
8829 2018-12-29 19:52:28 *The way Arsenal is going down ehn..*

8830 2018-12-29 19:52:19 My joints still ache and my lips haven’t produced their own natural oil in about six years I’ll be DAMNED if I’m told to “reduce stress”
8831 2018-12-29 19:51:43 Turkey???  Erdogan's son buys ISIS oil on the cheap.
8832 2018-12-29 19:51:42 I need a oil change 
8833 2018-12-29 19:51:39 Make the oil companies clean up their drilling sites instead of contaminating everything
8834 2018-12-29 19:51:38 ordered jojoba oil.... step nr. 2 to improving my skin. Now I just have to find a good SPF that won't ruin my face..... (and a night cream because my skin definitely needs it it's so dryyyyy)
8835 2018-12-29 19:51:28 I made me a conditioner w/ raw egg, extra virgin olive oil, ACV, and water..... when i tell y’all it stinks soooooo bad but my hair be super moisturized

8837 2018-12-29 19:51:24 I support the motion
8838 2018-12-29 19:51:23 Trudeau does not buy oil or set the price

8840 2018-12-29 19:51:18 Her sudden apparent pro oil comments are cynical electioneering. She and Trudeau are still joined at the hip on restricting AB energy growth tho she's now furiously trying to disconnect from him pre election. Rallys across AB and she's a no show.
8841 2018-12-29 19:51:09 It’s called the Oil Sands to the informed. I require proof of the health risk Mr.Wagner.  All I’m trying to get across is we need to stop spreading this garbage about subsidies which lefty spout constantly
8842 2018-12-29 19:51:07 I agree

“Slowing global growth”
“Crashing oil prices”
“Ukraine vs. Russia”

And on and on
8843 2018-12-29 19:51:02 Stop drinking the kool-aid Steve.
Anyone that reads knows the price of oil was going down no matter who won the election. Get out while you can from Doug Trump.
8844 2018-12-29 19:50:59 Olive Oil is very versatile, it has many applications...
8845 2018-12-29 19:50:56 Yet we give billions of our tax dollars to big Corps, especially oil corps, that is capitalism at work
8846 2018-12-29 19:50:38 Hey #WeakAndy so the Trudeau Liberals caused world oil prices to begin a decline in 2014. Absolutely amazing. BC forest industry is having it tough now too, guessing the Trudeau liberals caused that too. You and Harper didn't bring oil to tidewater, you had 10 years.
8847 2018-12-29 19:50:35 Once GE devalued/ stopped defending the Naira and removed subsidy pressures and we resolved oil issues; our reserves bounced back, add to that some loans taken and they now seem higher.

That is why I asked if you knew what Fx reserves were?
8848 2018-12-29 19:50:30 Yeee ngizwile bhudi, but nxa ulefulu thenki le kicking oil, wonalawa amafutha amabili uyamila amahlwayi
8849 2018-12-29 19:50:28 Not the worst, but I'd recommend taking it in soon. Don't need used old oil running in your car for too long

8860 2018-12-29 19:49:03 I only use oils  olive oil, castor oil, jojoba oil, coconut oil, palm oil, hell if it got oil in it Ill mix it up and throw it in my puff after being natural for ten years it dawned on me half the creams just weighed my hair down.
8861 2018-12-29 19:48:56 Thing is rasanya yang culik Stokin tu budak-budak yang confirm tak reti jaga kucing. They've been known to kill ikan orang dalam akuarium by pouring oil in it 
8862 2018-12-29 19:48:48 LOL it’s weird that living in a box in a building makes you live fast but texas is awesome because i always have access to self sustaining ecosystems like the ones you describe

while working in texas oil fields, the answer to “what did you do this weekend” can be insanely varied
8863 2018-12-29 19:48:23 Word. I bought sudafed and Flonase, but the only thing that really worked was keeping peppermint essential oil in my humidifier. I couldn’t even taste food for a couple days.smh. I’m just now really getting back to normal.
8864 2018-12-29 19:48:15 I use coconut and lavender oil and it calms it down pretty fast
8865 2018-12-29 19:48:15 2018 the year i learned u can’t put coconut oil on ur face but u can totally put greek yogurt inside ur vagina. tf man.

8868 2018-12-29 19:47:47 I thought I was buying the cocoa I bought the damn coconut oil one .. the shit stinks
8869 2018-12-29 19:47:46 Never added butter, sometimes oil - kept it on mid-low! But I’ll try again following your tips :)
8870 2018-12-29 19:47:43 I use it for minor scratches. Boots sell lots of preps which can be given to animals - cod liver oil comes to mind so can't see how they choose not to sell one product but gladly take money for others
8871 2018-12-29 19:47:32 So glad I didn't sleep in and got some breakfast before changing the oil and keeping my 300k mile truck running. My bad I guess I was still sleeping after all.
8872 2018-12-29 19:47:31 Chef Gusteau cut up some rotten zucchini, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a fine cut of beef, along with cheese.

8874 2018-12-29 19:47:23 So I made an appointment online to go to @MonroAutoTire to get a simple oil change just to show up and have the guy tell me he’s busy....what the fuck is the point of making an online appointment if thats the case...such shitty service
8875 2018-12-29 19:47:16 Ah, Tade, there's one Egg Roll they sell at Con Oil (4th Roundabout) that can compete well with Puff-Puff o! Iz like there's juju in the thing 
8876 2018-12-29 19:47:08 I need castor oil and coconut oil. Didnt even notice how low I was.

8881 2018-12-29 19:46:45 Let's see.

Mexicans play a role in the world today. By culture, economy and science. 

Moon goddess? They are only oil providers and thats it. 

Moon goddess accomplished nothing. People run desperately from those countries to the civilization.
8882 2018-12-29 19:46:42 So Ol boy on the train going up and dow. Selling snacks and incense, so guy behind me goes "only crack heads by incense when they have oil burners now
8883 2018-12-29 19:46:28 THIS CAR STINKS LIKE OIL. BETTER TRY TO FIX IT WITH MY FARTS AND ASS STANK. *moans involentarily*
8884 2018-12-29 19:46:26 Who else has relations with this “Corrupto”?

Cuba, Venezuela through subsidized oil, Nicaragua, Germany, Japan ......

What hogwash blaming the US for everything.
8885 2018-12-29 19:46:23 I swear by it. Just got over 5 days of laryngitis in Nov. it would’ve been worse without the oil!
8886 2018-12-29 19:46:19 Finally, America Ends Dependence On Foreign Oil, Addresses Climate Change Better Than EU. And Al Gore is nowhere to Be Found.
8887 2018-12-29 19:46:07 I've been thru a hundred different anti anxiety/antidepressants and none have even remotely worked. I started studying and by the Grace of God I found something that changed my life. Hemp oil. 100% legal. Google it. God bless.
8888 2018-12-29 19:45:55 I'm steadily rolling into the boring energy names - $SU, $CNQ (added it back), $KEY, $TRP, $IPL.  $PPL still above my buy zone.  The dividend cash flows are good. Won't take much of a bounce in oil for portfolio managers to pile back in.
8889 2018-12-29 19:45:52 Hope move went well. Great plan! No palm oil is top of my list
8890 2018-12-29 19:45:46 Whip together 2 1/2 pints Guancamole with 9 tsps green beans. Sprinkle with Olive Oil. Allow to harden Serve warm.

A lot of black smoke...oil circuit breaker or transformer
8896 2018-12-29 19:44:49 Bowser is actively dumping the oil from on top of a castle, forcing Mario to collect it in not one but two buckets
8897 2018-12-29 19:44:42 The fact she lived in the Bronx between ages 0-5 is basically meaningless. I agree she could be a political force nationally. A lot of naive and ignorant folks willing to buy the snake oil pedaled by Socialists. Someone will need to pick up the mantle when old Bernie hangs it up.
8898 2018-12-29 19:44:40 Leave Venezuelans and their oil alone !!

"Led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudis have used their oil wealth to outsource the war, hiring desperate survivors of Sudan’s conflict.
8901 2018-12-29 19:44:11 After following the ongoing #Belarus-#Russia oil tariffs negations, all I want for the new year is that the issue of #Belarus as an independent state won’t be questioned in Russian media
8902 2018-12-29 19:44:04 I put da thc oil from my pen in my blunt. Big high
8903 2018-12-29 19:44:02 When Jimmy Carter wanted to slap a tariff on crude oil congress prevented him. A useful precedent. Not that long ago. 

Or we could just let Trump hash all this out with the Chinese himself. What are the odds President Xi is smarter and craftier than him, after all?
8904 2018-12-29 19:43:57 I have a jojoba oil conditioner I found at TJ Maxx that I use for both my hair and beard.
8905 2018-12-29 19:43:52 Some folks in life have high standards and class.
Some folks don't and are low life's.
Oil and vinegar 
You can shake and blend for a time, but in the end it always separates.
Melena has class army boots look nice.
Michael doesn't, 4000$ glitz boots looking like a HoHo
8906 2018-12-29 19:43:49 I love your work Jon, I'm an oil painter myself. You really captured her spirit & intensity superbly in this piece 
8907 2018-12-29 19:43:46 I also bought Shea Moisture 100% Coconut oil shampoo. I haven’t tried it yet but I heard good things!
8908 2018-12-29 19:43:29 You export more maple syrup than oil. A maple syrup pipeline would have no trouble being built
8909 2018-12-29 19:43:08 To suggest that Energy East would not be restarted leaves out the why. Trudeau changed the rules of the game and that needed to be fully explained. 
Also Bill C69 provided the final nail by applying restrictions put on no other industry including oil imports or coal exports
8910 2018-12-29 19:43:07 How bad is it to be 3,500km’s past due for an oil change? Asking for a car...
8911 2018-12-29 19:43:00 some of my favourite albums of 2018

8912 2018-12-29 19:42:58 I’ve honestly never tried an all greens juice. I can eat it but juicing it. The texture is yucky to me. Plus I like smoothies more. I don’t eat a lot of sweets so I mostly get my sugar from fruits. 

Black seed oil tho, as gross as it is, I can handle that.
8913 2018-12-29 19:42:45 When your boyfriend takes your car to get an oil change while you’re on vacation #hubbymaterial
8914 2018-12-29 19:42:45 The scientific community in the western world use something called evidence based medicine. If a pinch of oregano is not proven to cure an ailment, then it is not called medicine, it's just an herb. The guru and snake oil salesmen are the one calling it "alternative medicine".
8915 2018-12-29 19:42:34 This is so Canadian I can hardly stand it!!  Neat!! this human from BC hopes this works out for Albertan oil!! Great job Premier @RachelNotley
8916 2018-12-29 19:42:29 However,  Venezuela is not in recesion due to the crash in oil prices. This whole country infrastructure was built with an oil price of $9. Instead, lack of economic freedom and corruption for the past 20 years are some of several causes.
8917 2018-12-29 19:42:23 Matt Klentak not trading for the right players at all star break. Add Machado and Happ and Britton and we are in the playoffs. We were in first August 8th. Starting pitching was leaking oil in July. It was obvious
8918 2018-12-29 19:42:00 2/2 Whereas the refined highly polyunsaturated oil is extremely chemically reactive - artist's linseed oil rags catching fire etc. Stabilisation with AOX for food is a necessity - but after all that processing and recombining -  shelf life is only ~a year.
8919 2018-12-29 19:41:45 Yeah bro the only thing stopping hitting the dispenso is there closing hours or if I want a lot of oil
8920 2018-12-29 19:41:45 the oil on that damn pillar made me smell like lube for a week
8921 2018-12-29 19:41:45 what do we need owner to do? bring in oil money?
8922 2018-12-29 19:41:18 Cuticle oil saves my life
8923 2018-12-29 19:41:14 DDB...As you know, it's mostly algo's and high frequency trading now accounting for like 80% of volume, little rhyme or reason. Especially when algos are triggered by oil and treasury futures and the like. Been in this racket 28 years next year. Never seen this kind of action.
8924 2018-12-29 19:41:11 My mum only revealed that she knows I smoke once I told her to stop buying peanut butter with palm oil in it
8925 2018-12-29 19:41:07 Went from lavender oil on my mark to a vodka shower! But the cut still fresh af 
8926 2018-12-29 19:40:55 Putting Coconut Oil & Lotion On My Body Really Does Put Me In A Better Mood.
8927 2018-12-29 19:40:53 In reality most non university school art programs don’t use oil paints because it stinks up the facilities :p or they have their own specific space bc the chemicals are actually quite dangerous
8928 2018-12-29 19:40:42 Next time I need an oil change I bet I hop on YouTube. I’m not paying jiffy lube shit else lol
8929 2018-12-29 19:40:41 You anit said nothing slick to a can of oil -@TheRealKevo4
8930 2018-12-29 19:40:39 Demonstração de afeto é eu aplicar meu protetor solar facial da ROC oil control no meu namorado
8931 2018-12-29 19:40:26 …むにゃ…ぐぅ(エルザちゃんに寄りかかる
8932 2018-12-29 19:40:18 Yo tomo Roaccutan (para el acné) hace tiempo. Un protector de los buenos (No Oil - Laroche) hoy en día esta 800 pesos, si lo agarrás en oferta. Esto es más bien un tema estético asi que no tiene mayor importancia. Los Dermaglós están carísimos también...
8933 2018-12-29 19:40:17 So when making weed brownies after making the oil you just throw the weed away ? serious question
8934 2018-12-29 19:40:10 I was burning the midnight oil last night. 나 어젯밤에 밤 새서 공부했어.
8935 2018-12-29 19:40:07 全ての油という油に感謝しているよ。
8936 2018-12-29 19:39:51 Ning gawas baya gud kog balay mars para lang palit oil yawaern nangita kog tindahan hahahahahaha
8937 2018-12-29 19:39:46 It's quite adorable that the notion of inflation over time doesn't even register for you though. You'd be amazed to hear how cheap Standard Oil was
8938 2018-12-29 19:39:42 あいよ！
8939 2018-12-29 19:39:40 There’s little confidence in global oil prices more like it. Why invest into an industry that has overproduced itself out of competitiveness?
8940 2018-12-29 19:39:34 Just hasn't been to a strip club yet. Give it time. #bestpolemusicever
8941 2018-12-29 19:39:31 ありがとう！！！
8942 2018-12-29 19:39:27 nothing to highlight .. this should be the avg range (as in earlier months)..now crude oil @ arnd 50$.. 2 months back it was 80$ .. so thats y the drop now (we r importing country) ... there were protests earlier because of demand of tax cut due to too much hike 
8943 2018-12-29 19:39:26 doing some work on my car, oil change. Surprised they don’t make this stuff flavored, kinda like a coffee creamer? It’d taste a lot better to be completely honest. I gotta finish like 2 1/2 of these things? 
8944 2018-12-29 19:39:25 if you think the freedom bucket is a great deal, brownells is selling freedom 55-gallon oil drums of ammo. no this is not a joke
8945 2018-12-29 19:39:14 Disappointing to me!
Nenshi was as much booed for lecturing oil patch workers on AGW
Many are professional scientists who disagree with global warming theory which is so fully embraced by journalists who simply regurgitate green talking points and mock those who don't conform 1/2
8946 2018-12-29 19:39:12 Really? The fault of Democrats?

Not the fault of those who put the policies in action?

Nice try Donny- but there isn’t a bloke alive who would buy that snake oil. 

Well- maybe a few of your supporters but they will come around!
8947 2018-12-29 19:38:53 My sister, trying to do a science experiment thing she got for xmas: Dad what is this word!

Dad: ....Hon? What the hell is "essential oil"? Why is it so important? Do we /need/ it?

Mom: *dying of laughter*

8948 2018-12-29 19:38:48 頑張れ！
8949 2018-12-29 19:38:40 Oil is the key to crispy edges. Only a cap though.
8950 2018-12-29 19:38:27 yo i swear if you’re ever feeling down, just buy a new face mask, get some new lil face mist, moisturize and clean ur shit up. o & if ur really wanting to self care the shit outta yo self, turn that oil diffuser on. i’m feeling like a new woman today 
8951 2018-12-29 19:37:57 Well yea, peppermint oil alone has properties that stimulate hair growth & tea tree assists w cleansing the scalp and freeing it of certain agents so that makes sense. Other than that, it’s a no for me
8952 2018-12-29 19:37:53 おやすみ
8953 2018-12-29 19:37:51 Absolutely , along with reform we need countries not just US to help these countries with their economy and criminal justice system. Just as we do when there's oil we need to control
8954 2018-12-29 19:37:45 The entire new committee will not have subpoena nor legislative power. Green New Deal was killed by corporate Dems who are invested in and take donations from Big Oil. The committee will also allow members who are invested in and take money from Big Oil. Anything else?
8955 2018-12-29 19:37:30 It could very well be that my entire meaning and purpose in this life time was to invent Primordial Oil.
8956 2018-12-29 19:37:28 Whatever barrier, sprayed with grease and oil.
8957 2018-12-29 19:37:17 I love reading about Iranian saber-rattling. Perhaps it should re-look the  vulnerability of  its Kharg Island oil terminal and the impact of no longer being part of the global economy.
8958 2018-12-29 19:37:12 I Luv Vodka!  Spritzer for your linens: 1c Vodka + 1c H2O + 16 drops essential oil: to disinfect & freshen
8959 2018-12-29 19:37:04 they load it up w flower trim oil which only works in large amounts. whole plant extracts like i use affects the whole body and can be specifically dosed
8960 2018-12-29 19:37:04 Olbas Oil is just pensioner poppers
8961 2018-12-29 19:37:03 Fact: thieves essential oil WORKS. Everyone in my immediate family and everyone on my side of the family got the stomach bug. Only one not sick. 
8962 2018-12-29 19:36:38 I was just about to suggest there products all of them are excellent!!! Also Cactus oil smells so good and will cure dry scalp!! I have locs and only use cactus oil and it gives my hair life!!!
8963 2018-12-29 19:36:36 I’m getting my oil changed and transmission serviced at ford and everyone in the waiting lobby is 50 years or older watching price is right reruns. I see where I’m headed
8964 2018-12-29 19:36:30 Quick question,would you accept Oil Money Arabs to take over the club just to get rid of Kroenke?
8965 2018-12-29 19:36:09 8 years until what penetration rate? Global EV sales maybe 2MM versus ~80MM of internal combustion engine? Oil demand will continue to grow until ~2040. And who pays the ~$4 trillion for charging station and infra buildout?
8966 2018-12-29 19:36:01 It’s already cooked in oil, then you put the stuff on it
8967 2018-12-29 19:35:46 i think it might be using oil & butter...but definitely the oil. my dad is the king of crispy edge pancakes and none of us can figure out how he does it lol
8968 2018-12-29 19:35:35 Shout-out to CBD oil for helping me actually concentrate on work today 
8969 2018-12-29 19:35:32 Eternal black storm, rain like motor oil. Winds of dust sandblasting skin. Nothing survives in the wake of mankind. Nothing can grow where we set foot. Yet we try to build, cities built on ruins. Destined to be ruins once again. Nothing can survive in the wake of mankind, nothing
8970 2018-12-29 19:35:26 That increased price will be mitigated by the money given back through tax returns from the carbon tax revenues. Also, global gas prices continue to shift, and cause significant price increases(as well as drops), due to dependence on oil from OPEC nations.
8971 2018-12-29 19:35:26 It’s not oil. It’s a batter. Conditions, grows and keeps Beard healthy and lush.
8972 2018-12-29 19:35:13 anyway....ima drown my hair in coconut oil, drown my face in aloe & watch Netflix 
8973 2018-12-29 19:35:06 おきて
8974 2018-12-29 19:35:04 Thank you!! I vegan friend put on Facebook "why is everyone concerned about palm oil when they eat meat?" Shaming people for trying is not cool
8975 2018-12-29 19:34:58 2019 im not going to tell you to fuck off, nah
Instead, ima tell you to smother your face in rosehip oil and pray
8976 2018-12-29 19:34:50 Yup.  All of our enemies are self made aside from China and Russia.  If we stopped our dependence on oil and Israeli lobbyists the entire Middle East would be completely irrelevant
8977 2018-12-29 19:34:50 One of the writers is a millionaire doctor who will never lose his job, pension, should live 3 blocks away his practice. He must not use flights for his conferences, or anything related to oil, except his >200K salary supported by oil and gas extraction
8978 2018-12-29 19:34:46 Palm Oil sef is known for depleting forest cover, destroying flora and fauna etc.
8979 2018-12-29 19:34:33 Islam is a nightmare; totally intolerant of kaffirs and impossible to integrate. How it hasn't been declared as an illegal sect in the free world I cannot understand, unless it is the oil.
8980 2018-12-29 19:34:25 Ya for sure! I've been ordering oil from CannTrust. But it's expensive and clumsy to bake with. Hopefully this can just replace the basic butter. Plus is a good way to get rid of shake and keif.
8981 2018-12-29 19:34:13 peanut oil... classy
8982 2018-12-29 19:34:09 Getting this free oil change might’ve been the highlight of my day
8983 2018-12-29 19:34:08 はあ いってきます バイトだ
8984 2018-12-29 19:34:06 Next stop Emptyhad.. Arab oil men we're coming.
8985 2018-12-29 19:34:05 Took campaign donations from big oil execs and leaned his vote a little further right than so like even considering oil is in Texas blood. I like him. I just want to know more. Bernie still has it going on and he is right about the solutions. Way to make wage  increases happen.
8986 2018-12-29 19:34:00 Ah no fit can laff. My laff iyaf finish..
8987 2018-12-29 19:33:56 This is a really nice recipe I tried recently. You could use less oil too cauliflower fry recipe, how to make cauliflower fry | cauliflower recipeshttps://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/cauliflower-fry-recipe/
8988 2018-12-29 19:33:49 Beard oil
8989 2018-12-29 19:33:47 You see, you start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it
8990 2018-12-29 19:33:46 (My memories of being forced to take fish oil - on spoons first! later as capsules - are one of many things about my childhood that I feel would totally get explored in my villain backstory "this is why she is this way" montage.)
8991 2018-12-29 19:33:46 the oil market is about to bounce back,  Notley has increased railway cars, and she is fighting very hard for Albertans and the pipeline.  You were in power for 10 years and did NOTHING!  Another conservative who thinks he's entitled to rule Alberta. Go away already
8992 2018-12-29 19:33:40 Cam across Mark Wiens on YouTube, he goes around the world trying diff cuisine. Currently watching the vidoes where he's in Pakistan and honestly even I wouldn't eat half the food he did. My mum didn't even let my auntie cook with Ghee they had to buy sunflower oil for us lmao.
8993 2018-12-29 19:33:39 Hey Dr. Oregano oil works very well at the onset of a cold. It's all we use.
8994 2018-12-29 19:33:36 D best premier league side won the treble 
They were relevant in Europe, not some pub oil money team
8995 2018-12-29 19:33:31 @Europcar your car runs out of oil, 5 hours later it’s towed away. Europcar NCL Airport, no bother come tmrw you can have same type. I turn up, no refund, no apology and waste hours of hols, they tell me can’t have auto like I had have to take a manual vw. Awful customer service!
8996 2018-12-29 19:33:31 Lol these Chrysler people think I’m stupid, give me my expensive ass oil change so I can go eat
8997 2018-12-29 19:33:25 Must have tripped a circuit breaker.
8998 2018-12-29 19:33:18 Naturals!! Jojoba Oil is the TRUTH. I highly recommend using it as a prepoo and daily oil for your hair. Only 100% organic tho. Ya welcome.
8999 2018-12-29 19:33:16 You cant taste the oil or anything actually. Its just so it doesnt stuck. It lowkey works like a lube 
9000 2018-12-29 19:32:45 Worst overdose I ever saw was Pennyroyal Oil. Quack quack.
9001 2018-12-29 19:32:42 Can't wait to take this shower and drown my body in almond oil and lotus flower, I'm so tired  I'll just put on a facemask and stay in the hot tub.
9002 2018-12-29 19:32:36 i like olive oil makes
9003 2018-12-29 19:32:35 You people I had edible cupcakes... I almost ran crazy,  my neighbors were binding and casting the demon in me. Rubbing anointing oil and things. 

It wasn't funny yesterday,  I was screaming "help me".

Thank God sha
9004 2018-12-29 19:32:20 Price of all crude oil based fuels have fallen even more since you were ripped off by your union!!  Keep lining the union bosses pockets with your money not mine!
9005 2018-12-29 19:32:19 I stick with what is tried and true and for me its Paul Mitchell, Kenra, water, coconut oil, jamaican black castor oil and Gel.
9006 2018-12-29 19:32:18 Pizza Hut na fraud guys. Just pack plenty tissue paper cos na oil go full your hand
9007 2018-12-29 19:32:16 That feeling when a linseed oil vitamin D capsule gets stuck in your throat and your main thought is, at least it wasn't fish oil, like granny forced on me back in the day.
9008 2018-12-29 19:32:12 Not really. It happens everytime you dont stir it cuz it will just be cooking together. I think the oil just helps you to not have to stand by it and stir it till its done. Cuz I never used oil and then my stepdad whos like good cook told me to use oil so I dont have to stir.
9009 2018-12-29 19:32:12 That's really good wow! How long have you been oil painting?
9010 2018-12-29 19:32:10 The whole team played really well tonight after conceding the opening goal...
A true champion mindset is being seen from watching this Liverpool side...
Hope they lift the premier league and show that, passion can still triumph over Arab Oil money...

9011 2018-12-29 19:32:06 No it’s because there’s coconut oil in it which is too cold to come out!
9012 2018-12-29 19:32:06 Didn't realize how vegetable oil was made. Eye opener, to say the least. Olive oil and real butter please...
9013 2018-12-29 19:32:05 Beans and engine oil
9014 2018-12-29 19:32:02 You are pointing out a complex problem, and a less fatalistic person would hope for a complex solution. IF it is impossible to consume less oil in one area (say ) how much MORE must we prioritize shifting to renewable or less harmful solutions in other areas (, etc.)?
9015 2018-12-29 19:31:42 @BootsHelp I wonder why she wouldn't serve me though? Are staff told not to serve cat owners with castor oil? We need to be told! #castoroil
9016 2018-12-29 19:31:21 Have you seen the ballooning deficit (thanks GOP), falling oil prices, and stock market over the past 3 months? These DO NOT signal a strong economy, unless you’re delusion (finger pointing at you)
9017 2018-12-29 19:31:21 "...just so wealthy coal and oil barons can make a few extra bucks" and pass some of those extra bucks to politicians in the form of campaign contributions.

9019 2018-12-29 19:31:13 It's not ready yet but it's getting there. Days of oil fuelled cars are numbered. 5 more years. Maximum 8 years. It's destroyed our environment for far too long.  #saynotooil
9020 2018-12-29 19:31:11 Action continues tonight but same routine 

Champs then to paragon if u know u know 

Welcome to the oil city Eric
9021 2018-12-29 19:31:09 Aren't these the same brain-dead Texan troglodytes who've started multiple scam companies begging people to invest in drilling for oil in Israel because somehow, according their dumbass interpretation of the Bible, it's there?
9022 2018-12-29 19:31:00 currently giggling creepily to myself over the idea of CBD oil that isn't vegan

9027 2018-12-29 19:30:27 Would rather those mercenaries from manchester win it...it will be just another trophy bought with oil money and no one will give a fuck
9028 2018-12-29 19:30:17 KNEW WE'D NEED CASTOR OIL AFTER THEY SHOVED THAT ONE UP OUR BACKSIDE!
9029 2018-12-29 19:30:13 Having trouble sleeping? Try our oil blend Sleep. You'll love how refreshed you'll feel in the morning!
9030 2018-12-29 19:30:09 i was about to say i do oil changes for a living right now but if you need it done i gotchu 
9031 2018-12-29 19:30:09 Because of course I bought the wrong motor oil - and only noticed after Finishing the oil change. Of fucking course

9033 2018-12-29 19:30:01 Going to work on a North Sea oil terminal voluntarily for 2 years. The thought of them Scouse cunts winning the league is unbearable
9034 2018-12-29 19:29:54 Conditioner just coats it, use the natural coconut oil, you will see a differance, what color you putting on brave one?
9035 2018-12-29 19:29:51 Landlords have bills to pay, electric, trash, water, oil, mortgage.....what are they supposed to do without rent money
9036 2018-12-29 19:29:41 Same majority said he couldn't win?
9037 2018-12-29 19:29:38 No way.

They are the left arm of the Republican party.
Anyone taking oil money has sold us all out.

9039 2018-12-29 19:29:28 And i wasn't saying Buhari is better. I'm saying comparing Jonathan to be better than Buhari did you ever factor in the country's financial state in which both operated with? That's my point. Jonathan should do better than Buhari because he made a lot in oil.

9045 2018-12-29 19:28:40 In the last 24 hrs there were a total of 1 oil product tankers in the ports of Quebec City and Montreal. Yet according to Quebec Premier François Legault, there is no social acceptability for oil in Quebec.

9049 2018-12-29 19:28:16 A few drops of oregano oil a day keeps the doctor away!
9050 2018-12-29 19:28:14 I use it in social situations, it’s perfect for mitigating social anxiety 

It’s like a mild relaxer that quiets the monkey mind

The effects last for about 45 minutes to an hour 

I love the vape form though, it’s so much easier to carry around than the tincture/oil
9051 2018-12-29 19:28:08 I’ve cooked directly on the weber grill without the plank before. Oil the grill and char up heavily. Grill for a few minutes aside to sear the flesh and crisp the skin. Then move over and cook it indirectly until cooked through.
9052 2018-12-29 19:28:03 That's not the problem. Alberta has the independence needed to do what Norway did. Decided to give tax breaks to oil companies. When oil become unprofitable because of global prices, the companies bailed. Which is what private companies should do. Should not be surprised now.
9053 2018-12-29 19:28:00 My dad is the only person I know that can take parts from an industrial soda machine & turn it into a pump to replace the oil in his Mercedes instead of paying them $180 to do it
9054 2018-12-29 19:27:53 Sorry bro, i have 1 liter of anointing oil here that you can gulp.
9055 2018-12-29 19:27:50 The US has manufacturing, natural resources, STEM, textiles, farming ranching etc etc.
Very diverse economy.
Venezuela did rely heavily on oil production because it was a socialist top down economy.
Rather than allowed entrepreneurs to create a diverse economy.
Socialism sucks
9056 2018-12-29 19:27:38 Oil change on my car feels amazing 
9057 2018-12-29 19:27:31 Nothing kills innovation, motivation, human imagination more than socialism. 
Mostly imagination would be dedicated to imagining a full stomach, warm house, a life free of fear and despair. Motivation, searching for cast off scraps. Innovation, unimaginable
9058 2018-12-29 19:27:27 Let's see when gas prices were $1.35 a litre without the carbon tax people complained it was price fixing by big oil now that the price is .97-$1.01 they complain it's the carbon tax- hmm
9059 2018-12-29 19:27:23 In the Netherlands soya oil goes with an pseudonym:
[slaolie] "Lettuce Oil" - sold by the litre, no single person realizes it's soy oil, until they understand that 100% plant oil in various contents, means basically 100% soy oil.
With 45% PUFA no mention of ADDED vit. D or B

9065 2018-12-29 19:26:13 AND the ogx argon oil of morocco shampoo and conditioner
9066 2018-12-29 19:26:00 Like 6 drops it’s a pretty big one too. It’s not a lot of build up like my old one but I can definitely feel/see the oil in there after dumping it out. I just left hot water sit in there for a few minutes then wiped it out. For a deep clean (once a month) I heard to use vinegar??
9067 2018-12-29 19:25:59 Good! The big cities are liberals strength, hence why they always attack the rural communities and try to limit the rural voting ability by redrawing the district maps. Big liberal cities are also responsible for the majority of pollution but they blame Alberta and oil and gas.
9068 2018-12-29 19:25:58 I think the price drop is more to do with the price of oil there  has been a significant drop......but keep patting yourself

9075 2018-12-29 19:25:18 Appreciate and respect your concerns.

Competing again Man City/Chelsea oil money whilst Emirates was being built, had to sell best players continually and yet until last couple seasons still managed to quality for CL

9090 2018-12-29 19:23:52 I'm  intrigued. Which CBD oil is good? Are they really good or just a placebo and a waste of money? I suffer with chronic pain and always hear about CBD but i've tried so many things im afraid to be throwing yet another supplement out in the bin lol
9091 2018-12-29 19:23:47 @CHAZDEAN what’s the name of the dry oil @JLJeffLewis kept talking about in Friday’s show? I can’t find it on your website and I want to buy it.
9092 2018-12-29 19:23:41 Yes it does. But not for long. Even the boost in oil prices won't sustain. And anything less than $75 a barrel is bad news for Putin and his crew. So yes "America First" transference to "Russia First" is even worse, but still soon to be history.
9093 2018-12-29 19:23:40 To strengthen nails mix together warm olive oil, an egg yolk, and honey. Hold your hands in the mix for 10 minutes and wash with warm water.
9094 2018-12-29 19:23:39 The second largest is California Edison which is committed to solar. These are not the companies that we need to discourage. Its not fracking or crude oil. I think the article didn't do its research and just saw public utility and is making a headline.

9097 2018-12-29 19:23:02 The bottle of vegetable oil is a concept made by men.
9098 2018-12-29 19:22:59 I just put plain water in and let it run and then after that water is out I’ll take a paper towel and wipe residue off. how much oil are you putting in it?? You shouldn’t feel oil build up that fast
9099 2018-12-29 19:22:58 Yep, these are *also* problems. What we’re now discussing veers away from the focus of the article, but yes, vast quantities of plastic and other oil products are discarded every day, including in medicine. So you agree that the article doesn’t go far enough.

9105 2018-12-29 19:22:29 Mera ek explanation hai. Suppose I pay 40 rupee more just bcoz oil prices go haywire.. I will spend 10 more let's see the math
10x3 every day max =30 x 30 days =900 x 12 months = 11k..
This money is bigger or or the loot was bigger of my tax payed money..?

9108 2018-12-29 19:22:05 There are a lot, but I have no experience with using specifically watercolors on tinted paper. Guash, certain chalk pencils, maybe some oil pencils depending on how dark and sturdy the paper is. But it definitely has to be real tough paper to take the water in watercolors.

9157 2018-12-29 19:17:12 This consumption of plastic was pushed by the oil industry. One more reason they're evil fks driven by desire for enormous short term profit at the cost of long term environmental devastation.
9158 2018-12-29 19:17:08 Vegetable oil works pretty well. However, I have found that cheap non-stick spray does the job much faster/easier without as much interaction on my part. Get the stuff that doesn’t smell like butter.

I made a French version of this where, once you have fried veg in oil and before you add stock etc, pour in a tablespoon of cider/wine or Baltic vinegar, stirring all the while and allow to evaporate.  Adds a nice tang to it.

9180 2018-12-29 19:14:25 I like O'Rourke and I hope he's grown since I have some questions about his voting record and big oil private executives max donating to his campaigns. I'm not condeming him. Sanders, works non-stop, muscled some huge co's. to fork up living wages. He is the ultimate multitasker.
9181 2018-12-29 19:14:15 No problem girl! I use vitamin e oil and the Honey Drop moisturizer from Farmacy. Its so lightweight. My friend told me that Bosca is a good brand too. I haven’t tried it yet.
9182 2018-12-29 19:14:07 How many countries have US corporations gone into and ruin their environment and took, took, took, took especially our oil and mining companies?
9183 2018-12-29 19:14:07 Beard oil. Bacon. An old book. Vanilla sweet cream cold brew.  A pen.

9186 2018-12-29 19:13:07 Though the right suffers from extremely poor and ineffective messaging, indoctrination/ takeover of institutions hastens a belief that freedom is truly velvet glove slavery. Resources will be allocated by a prescient, omnipotent, benevolent gov that cares
9187 2018-12-29 19:13:04 Are you that ignorant?  Really? Downward commodity?  You couldn’t quit oil and that’s a fact. Pathetic.
9188 2018-12-29 19:13:01 Yes, once the oil is all finished.
9189 2018-12-29 19:12:58 what you sayin fam  night clubs is where we modern dictators make our social policies before spraying champs over pole dancers ya gets me
9190 2018-12-29 19:12:50 Geo. W. Bush went to war with Iraq but after defeating Saddam, we left without control of the oil. ISIS took over getting $1-3 million a day from the oil. How stupid we are. @WSJ @RealJack @seanhannity @marklevinshow #GOP
9191 2018-12-29 19:12:48 gave my mom some CBD oil & she’s so cute. “crys, my headache is finally gone”  ily

9194 2018-12-29 19:12:28 Children sent to kill children for the human being's love for black gold / oil! Mega tragic re #Yemen and beyond!!
9195 2018-12-29 19:12:26 I get it, though I don't recall him ever taking shots at Hall. With that said, the piece on Russell isn't what many are making it out to be.

9200 2018-12-29 19:12:05 Yesterday I met another mom in Kentucky with a 12 yo. boy with intractable epilepsy. 10-20 seizures/day. She's waiting right now on test results that'll tell her if he'll have brain surgery. His Drs won't talk to her about even trying full spectrum oil, would rather operate...1/4
9201 2018-12-29 19:12:01 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
9202 2018-12-29 19:11:55 Have you seen the scale of coal mining or processing that we do? The largest machines in the world cut out a cubic mile of coal per year along w/ equal amounts of oil (etc). Burn that up, put equal parts of it in the ocean and air, & you get the graph of CO2 over last 100 years.
9203 2018-12-29 19:11:51 If you don't count salt pepper and olive oil I can make 5 ingredient meals all week. I can also grocery shop for $30 for the week.
9204 2018-12-29 19:11:47 Made an appointment at @McDavidHondaFri  4an oil change only to be told to either schedule another appointment or stay here all day. Which is why we made an appointment in the first place today. It suvkd bc it’s a lease and now we’ve drove here twice 30 miles each way. They suck
9205 2018-12-29 19:11:47 Let me get up and get my oil changed 
9206 2018-12-29 19:11:44 Yes (no soap.) Dry. Season with SMALL amount of oil. 

Then: Jambalaya.

9210 2018-12-29 19:10:38 #LFC is proof that a well run football club not football business can win against the evil oil money. Clubs like arsenal united and spurs have no excuse this could have been them

9211 2018-12-29 19:10:36 Why would you be looking for the word "oil" in the article? Syria has no real oil deposits.

Or are you one of those crazy people?
9212 2018-12-29 19:10:33 To be clear, all companies in the oil/gas sector are looking at renewables such as wind and solar power, the global industry investing billions in renewables, particularly companies as Shell and BP.
9213 2018-12-29 19:10:30 An oil change shouldn’t cost $71!!!
9214 2018-12-29 19:10:28 To little to late, need the pipe now , Feds have dealt us a bad hand, time to  consider slowing down the transfer payments to non friendly unsupportive provinces or place tariff on OPEC oil.

9217 2018-12-29 19:10:20 @ConsumerReports RE:"Oils to Oils," CR reported coconut oil's (CO) sat. fat at roughly 90%, but CR did NOT report the "fatty acid profile" of coconut oil (or any oil). CO's sat. fat is "medium chain fatty acids" (MCFA), meaning the saturated fat is converted into energy not fat.

9219 2018-12-29 19:10:17 The only people enthusiastic about the weak committee, @NancyPelosi, headed by a rep that takes fossil fuel money, are the oil/gas companies that have bought you and the corporate dems out.
9220 2018-12-29 19:10:14 His results are more and more politicians not taking corporate PAC money/oil, on board for Medicare for All, Jeff Bezos strong armed into paying workers a living wage, etc. He’s affecting positive change, and ones the Dem party needs.

He also has a D rating from the NRA.

9222 2018-12-29 19:10:00 Bf and I came home drunk and had Mexican food.  He went down on me with spicy mouth and it burned like hell.  Then I tried putting peppermint oil on my pussy to cool it down.  It worked,  but then it was too cold so I ended the night by opening my lips up in front of the heater.
9223 2018-12-29 19:09:56 Housewarming gifts from my girl friends: bedsheets, kitchenware, essential oil diffuser.

Housewarming gifts from my guy friends: D’ussé, Jameson, Hennessy, wine.
9224 2018-12-29 19:09:42 Exactly. Plus with facial hair like that Utd look a shoe in to get some lucrative sponsorship deals in the beard grooming industry. Oil, wax, combs, the financial possibilities are endless @ edwoodward
9225 2018-12-29 19:09:41 Honestly...(and I'm speaking with the gravitas of a fictitious porn director  avatar here) not sure oil is a big factor in Russia's play in Syria. Think great power status, med/levant access, and power projection are much bigger deals
9226 2018-12-29 19:09:07 It exacerbated the OPEC collapse of the Texas Oil Economy.
9227 2018-12-29 19:08:56 Bright idea: a place in Orlando that does an oil change in an hour when you make an appointment
9228 2018-12-29 19:08:53 Sana oil nakaintindi
9229 2018-12-29 19:08:53 Beard oil smells so good. Glad I bought some
9230 2018-12-29 19:08:35 Can you please get your facts straight before you spew such nonsensical dribble? Light passenger vehicles make up approx 26% of total oil demand. Not everyone in India and China are buying 100% electric just yet. To my knowledge air travel dmnd exploding...electric planes? #OOTT

9235 2018-12-29 19:08:05 Changing oil in my car then going to the gym shortly
9236 2018-12-29 19:07:47 everyone I know works hard. almost no one I know is rich. Some of the people who work the hardest are the poorest. Selling this pie in the sky snake oil doesn't work anymore.
9237 2018-12-29 19:07:32 Trick is to use applesauce instead of oil  ppl won’t notice the difference!  its a lot less fat!

9243 2018-12-29 19:06:43 2 hour wait for an oil change  I just want my bed!!!!
9244 2018-12-29 19:06:41 I can't believe I used to feel like this all the time ... when I don't take my CBD oil or marijuana oil I feel like krapp. Why do I try to see how long I can go without my medicine every day? Like I feel guilty for needing it. It's so pointless and stupid.Just take your medicine
9245 2018-12-29 19:06:30 Will they leave out palm oil?
9246 2018-12-29 19:06:09 Discovery of gas will be better, oil will not be feasible due to lower international prices
9247 2018-12-29 19:05:50 I should have probably started with acrylic paints. Now I'm just nervous to even /try/ using my oil paints
9248 2018-12-29 19:05:46 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.

9252 2018-12-29 19:05:23 My highschool self realized the world is a corrupt machine and money was the oil and so wanted nothing to do with the capitalist system. 

Until my adult self realized poor people can't change squat and the finer things ain't cheap so fuck it, let's get this 
9253 2018-12-29 19:05:18 You pulled them out ? Use coconut oil or olive oil on them twice a day (morning & night).. it should help them grow back.
9254 2018-12-29 19:05:15 سبحان الله  عالجمال
9255 2018-12-29 19:05:10 Liverpool did what they had to do they fight for every first and second ball they score goals  concede very few and teams are afraid of them all that after selling 3 of their best players ...no oil money ... Can't knock it simply cant it hurts but fair play to them

9257 2018-12-29 19:04:56 Oh forgot that interview by macrone was actually from 2013, that was a bad bad year after independence campaign was announced the amount of Scottish oil reserves diminished by 70 years, Scottish oil is the only oil that fluctuates when independence is mentioned

9259 2018-12-29 19:04:43 Unfortunately, generation that fought/learnt lessons of WWII is passing, and most Americans don't understand rationale behind U.S. high-profile involvement abroad. Thus, USA is reverting to more historically "NORMAL" stance of quasi-isolationism; Don't need ME oil--so why stay?
9260 2018-12-29 19:04:40 EXCUSE ME I'M OFF TO GROOM AND OIL MY BEARD WITH MY MANY BEARD PRODUCTS
9261 2018-12-29 19:04:31 I still got my oil changed tho
9262 2018-12-29 19:04:27 Very common conditions such as dry eyes and blepharitis (when eyelids become inflamed and irritated due to clogged oil glands) can cause the apparent inability to immediately open the eyes in the morning. ... In the morning the eyelid is physically stuck to the surface of the eye
9263 2018-12-29 19:04:24 Went to get an oil change only for them to tell me I didn’t need one
9264 2018-12-29 19:04:23 موفق خير يابو ناصر

9267 2018-12-29 19:04:19 On this holy oil early 
9268 2018-12-29 19:03:58 Thanks Lauchlan!

This was just how I felt after an oil change. 
9269 2018-12-29 19:03:55 Unai Emery? The same coach who threw away a 4-0 lead against Barca in Feb 2017? With all the oil money, yet couldn't win a champions league? Rebuilding what? LMAOOO! Pls give me Arteta. At least i'll understand he is younger & needs to build, not this European Aigbogun #LIVARS
9270 2018-12-29 19:03:52 I have to order the fragrance oil then you’ll get it
9271 2018-12-29 19:03:51 I'm gonna need that oil money to be pummed like madness in City's sqaud this January. Can't let Liverpool do as they please.
9272 2018-12-29 19:03:43 And how dare he look like that? Everyone voted for him because he looks.. like a normal guy AND skateboards, shocking, what a neolib. The big oil (donations from gas stn attendants) and some mild votes that were bi-partisan, establishment corporatist with his PAC and.. oh wait...
9273 2018-12-29 19:03:28 If there is anything that goes better with fish than sesame oil I haven't found it yet.

9275 2018-12-29 19:03:02 I’m so obsessed with flexing my amateur photographer muscles on social media that it rivals that of a tipsy suburban homemaker who impulsively takes up oil painting all while still clutching onto a glass of red wine.
9276 2018-12-29 19:02:52 vitamin e oil and rose water saved my skin
9277 2018-12-29 19:02:51 I also am microwave popcorn challenged. Using the oven top, pan with oil, and corn kernels is all I do now.
9278 2018-12-29 19:02:27 jealous? I'll send ya some bath oil
9279 2018-12-29 19:02:20 @HouseDemocrats @NancyPelosi We deserve a better climate action committee than one without political or subpoena power and one staffed by salaries invested in oil and coal. We deserve a #GreenNewDeal

9281 2018-12-29 19:02:06 Popcorns are normally fried in the same pot, in the same oil, at the same time and under the same heat conditions, But they do not all pop at the same time..never compete with anyone in your life ,your time will come

9283 2018-12-29 19:01:59 بسیار کتاب جالبیست به همه پیشنهاد می کنم. خیلی بیطرفانه و واقع گرایانه می نویسد‌. از او کتاب The Oil Kings را هم حتما بخوانید.  فقط ایشان آمریکایی نیستند با اینکه استاد دانشگاه کلمبیا هستند. ایشان نیو زلندی هستند.
9284 2018-12-29 19:01:56 Better yet, what is the distribution of the wealth from the oil production/revenue per region?  And while we are at this discussion, what is the average income in all combined 3 regions and separately just for #Barqah?
9285 2018-12-29 19:01:48 France knows the value of the ERV oil and gas fields. @realDonaldTrump, the patron saint of Bankruptcy attorneys, not so much.

9287 2018-12-29 19:01:15 Guy comes home and says, “well that smells good.” (I made Turkish style green beans for a family dinner later.) But honestly, what kind of monster wouldn’t think onions and garlic in olive oil with tomatoes smell good?
9288 2018-12-29 19:01:10 Why did the guy that’s doing my oil change ask if I wanted to get jerked off too? This week been crazy
9289 2018-12-29 19:01:08 Rex wouldn’t know the ‘truth’ if it hit him in the face. His truth is whatever oil companies say it is. He’s not going to bite the hand that pays him to say what they want him to say.

9293 2018-12-29 19:00:41 Ask a federal worker who isn’t getting paid; ask a farmer; ask those who are seeking asylum (it’s not illegal); ask anyone who worked for Carrier, GM, or Harley-Davidson.  He’s a liar, a cheater, a conman. He’s nothing more than a snake oil salesman.
9294 2018-12-29 19:00:35 Yeah it's important we give exclusions to NB coal, Quebec cement,12 million times of BC coal to China but if we have a chance to mail those rotten oil sands we need to stick if to them
9295 2018-12-29 19:00:35 Well, I can say I'm finishing this year on a positive note after completing a contract for a famous oil company and getting payments, that exceed all expectations. There are still so many things to do in the future, but right now I can deservedly chill with a couple of beers.
9296 2018-12-29 19:00:34 It’s definitely a splurge, but the kiehl's avocado one is the best one I’ve ever used. A great drugstore one is the neutrogena hyaluronic acid eye cream. And my favorite face oil atm is hemp oil which is what I’ve been using lately!
9297 2018-12-29 19:00:31 good convo boys. i told u arsenal could win  how horrible was that... hoping an oil dealer can buy arsenal and pump billions into the transfer funds.

9304 2018-12-29 19:00:03 CBD oil can help out a lot during one and help prevent them in the future
9305 2018-12-29 19:00:02 The shit the DACA for Rag boner didn’t get done was that a hairy bag hairy bit indecision from the 9th Oil The Glove allowed DACA to coupling house, thereby rag cans a Supreme Bastard shit. Lactoids tits, Dems dropped ointment - and that’s where we are shit, Democrat wonk..
9306 2018-12-29 19:00:00 I'm referring to the undamaged oilseed - will last a couple of years if stored correctly. The refined oil has a much shorter shelf-life - unless stabilised with chemical AOX cocktail.
9307 2018-12-29 18:59:59 Too woke for antidepressants. Making sure to drink plenty of water, eat fruits and veggies, manifest posi vibes as I vape CBD oil and sharpen my axe to Huey Lewis and the news
9308 2018-12-29 18:59:58 Sudafed, green tea with lemon and honey, Vick's and my oil diffuser got me together really quick
9309 2018-12-29 18:59:49 Dont use metal to mix resins, I recommend using silicone molds, if you don’t use silicon, I’d use a v thin layer of coconut oil to be able to knock the piece out of a hard mold, n wait a minimum 4 hours to remove from mold! Also, resin will cure more slowly in extreme cold/heat!
9310 2018-12-29 18:59:40 Look at that iguana's shame face. It's like he knows his ancestors ruled the planet and would roll in their oil drum if they could see him being abused by a raccoon
9311 2018-12-29 18:59:39 @Spoul_tweets @hendu11 guess who just got a talking to for having low oil 
9312 2018-12-29 18:59:37 Could be worse. Could drop your €30 full bottle of argan oil like I just did
9313 2018-12-29 18:59:34 Astroworld and Oil of every Pearls Un-insides
9314 2018-12-29 18:59:29 Maybe he didn't follow the "be sure of your target and what's beyond it" rule, shot through the deer and hit the oil well. The Commie dude may just not like people who don't follow Cooper's 4 rules. In seriousness, while you are correct, the right rarely show "Christan values".

Duk en Telegraaf leggen het nu wel heel erg dik bovenop voor wie ze lobbyen
9317 2018-12-29 18:58:48 Also, while Syrian oil may be shit compared with Iraqi oil, the Russians still want it and have promised Wagner 25% of it. The article looks thru the lens of “What does America gain?,” but ignores “What does America deprive its enemies of?”
9318 2018-12-29 18:58:28 Brody just yelled, “Bitch u smell like canola oil” it’s good to be home.

9322 2018-12-29 18:58:02 SURE. Let’s do anything EXCEPT logical and prudent steps of getting cheaper rent and directv distribution for @Pac12Network.

Larry Scott is a snake oil salesman. his act can’t continue! Really hoping no one buys into this concept.

misdirection like this insults our intelligence
9323 2018-12-29 18:57:43 Establishing that the consent of the governed is a fiction and then adding "that looks after their interests" is a mix of cynicism and optimism I find very oil-and-water, but then I suppose if I didn't I'd be one of the neoreactionaries.
9324 2018-12-29 18:57:37 U don't need to go far. Maggie and salt dey.. palm oil dey and cooking gas still dey.. omo am good.
9325 2018-12-29 18:57:31 Apparently I was coughing enough for the guy changing my oil to ask if I was choking on something. Love it
9326 2018-12-29 18:57:29 I got this essential oil smell stick for my cold and it looks like I’m just banging poppers in public.

9328 2018-12-29 18:57:27 Well since Kern County is one of the largest oil producing economies in the country it means a great deal.

9332 2018-12-29 18:57:14 I’m at mc Donald’s waiting for my oil change to be done. Some gwetto walks in with his fresh cut and pumped up kicks and asked the lady at the register if he can get a turkey sausage McMuffin. We stopped and looked at him as he left disappointed. #wrongplacebro
9333 2018-12-29 18:57:12 In past 2 years been through 2 surgeries, chemo, radiation, herniated discs and spurs (chronic back pain). I wont do opioids but CBD oil is a savior- worth a try and added benefit of helping anxiety.
9334 2018-12-29 18:57:12 As at September 2017/18 revenues from oil production £1.7bn. Oil price falling so unlikely to be replicated in H2. But even if it were & an Indy Scotland got the lot that leaves £4.5bn of deficit to find

9340 2018-12-29 18:56:22 Thank you PB! Yes - I think I channeled some of the cheeky allotment robins in there. Studying the mixing of oil paints (well, via You Tube) and going quite well. Shall have to try an owl soon - to accompany the charcoal one!
9341 2018-12-29 18:56:14 We cannot compete with FA FC. Just oil money to match it now
9342 2018-12-29 18:56:01 Sounds as though the Alberta oil money may have dried up for Rex.
9343 2018-12-29 18:55:53 me, adding vegetable oil to the pot: mmmm lube it up
9344 2018-12-29 18:55:44 @t_lastrapes help us out, essential oil man
9345 2018-12-29 18:55:43 #WeakAndy cannot figure out that tarsands is obsolete with excess oil: the reason we have cheap gas now. He will give more subsidy to prop up a dying industry
9346 2018-12-29 18:55:33 You better take palm oil 
Make you go slp
9347 2018-12-29 18:55:29 Going to the Oilers game with living legend @stevezieskidoo today. So, even if the Oil get their asses handed to them, the banter will be entertaining...
9348 2018-12-29 18:55:28 3- end result is explosion in differentials where some tight oil is no longer profitable.  That means growth in production will be less than expected.  Where the compensation will come from?
9349 2018-12-29 18:55:22 Duh it won' t change the oil glut you need plan b
9350 2018-12-29 18:55:19 4- والدولة تبيع لهم بالسعر العالمي ولاتخسر شيء ، هناك كذلك مشاريع صناعية تعتمد على النفط الخام او fuel oil اَي النفط الأسود لماذا تبيعون بسعر التراب في السوق العالمية افتحوا باب انشاء مشاريع تعتمد على النفط لاننا لايوجد لدينا غير النفط  ومشتقاته يمكن بيعه فورا  وتقضون على البطالة

9356 2018-12-29 18:54:54 Sage looking like one of the models that die in the tragic orange-mocha-frapachino oil fight fire scene at the start of Zoolander.
9357 2018-12-29 18:54:53 I recommend a teaspoon of coconut oil. It helps digestion so it might help. 
My dog had stomach problems and it helped her.
9358 2018-12-29 18:54:51 No pitchforks here, just the honest pursuit of truth. It's good and healthy to support each other in that process, especially when snake oil sales are through the roof. 

My flight's about to take off, but if you'd like further dialogue, you know where to find me. Take care!
9359 2018-12-29 18:54:38 CBD oil works well...
9360 2018-12-29 18:54:29 This guy is off the hook. It will take 12gallons if palm oil to restore him to factory settings 
9361 2018-12-29 18:54:19 売る側としてはバラすのは面倒なのもありますし、コレクションされていた訳ですから大切にして欲しいという願いもあると思ます。
以前ヤフオクでの質問で粘着質の人がいて気の毒だなって。私はまとめて買って頂ける方が現れる事を切に願っています。
9362 2018-12-29 18:54:19 The mix is basically matzah meal (sometimes called "Passover flour") and seasoning. I add oil and eggs, refrigerate for a short amount of time, and then form them into balls and drop into the broth +veggies.
9363 2018-12-29 18:54:09 the ones being ramped like oil was 100 bucks - it's half that!
9364 2018-12-29 18:53:52 Beto might be a great Senator representing oil and gas employees  who vote in Texas. But folks from states devastated already by climate change would like somebody NOT from oil rich Texas in the White House.
9365 2018-12-29 18:53:51 มันคงมาถึงสุดทางแล้วจริงๆ #บ๊ายบายโชคดีนะขอให้เจอแต่สิ่งดีๆ
9366 2018-12-29 18:53:50 Look at the date... 2010... That might have changed drastically in thew following years. With the downfall in oil prices and the not so impressive figure of Maduro, he needed to buy support...
9367 2018-12-29 18:53:30 Or even olive oil
9368 2018-12-29 18:53:22 Just bought the companion book of Anthropocene for my boss for Christmas. I've been drawn to Burtynsky's work since "Oil", but never drew that very apt parallel to McCarthy. Now I won't be able to un-think it when engaging with either!
9369 2018-12-29 18:53:04 A vehicle crash has shut down SR 29 in both directions at the intersection with Oil Well Road. Find an alternate route, if possible. Expect delays
9370 2018-12-29 18:52:56 Operative trolls working for the oil and coal industries continue with mis/disinformation. So inappropriate.  #environment #pollution #savetheplanet
9371 2018-12-29 18:52:45 Both of us are speaking the language of christians.  My other language is also Christian

Who speaks Arabic as lingua Franca? No one

Without oil, the moon goddess cultist are irrelevant in the world.

The overwhelming majority of world powers are christian
9372 2018-12-29 18:52:29 warm oil on my scalp be feeling soooo goood
9373 2018-12-29 18:52:14 The old bones and joints needs more oil.
9374 2018-12-29 18:52:11 Murder and stealing was for different divisions. Besides, there are so many other criminal enterprises. The Mafia makes a hundreds of millions off of basically watering down olive oil sold to Americans. For others you get big business and those with connections crushing-
9375 2018-12-29 18:52:10 I loose the weirdest stuff. Like for example I’m missing my oil cap !!! How do I looose an OIL CAP ! 
9376 2018-12-29 18:52:03 Great examples are the bank n auto industry bailouts. Big corporations privatize their profits but socialize their loses. In true capitalism, government don’t help companies. Oil companies could had helped the car industry since they develop fuel inefficient cars but they didn’t.
9377 2018-12-29 18:52:01 Oil Diesel mixture lights up far faster tho. One drop of diesel onto an oily surface and ashes falling down and Happy Early New Years firework ensures.
9378 2018-12-29 18:51:59 when you cook with peanut oil, if its heated up high enough, it kills the allergen (which is what chick fil a does)
9379 2018-12-29 18:51:49 I did some radiation.... but poison doesn’t sound like anything I’m ready for . If you get the right oil , and have the “right”disease... I’ve seen countless victories!
9380 2018-12-29 18:51:47 can’t wait to run my man a shower, pour oil on the floor, then beat him w/ a belt

9384 2018-12-29 18:51:34 @Valvoline I know you have a job when changing oil, but if you could train your male employees to not talk to women customers like we’re idiots, that would be great. I may be inside the car, but I can still hear the rude comments.

9390 2018-12-29 18:50:54 I think it might be ethylene glycol? Supposed to be sweet, which is why kids and pets at risk to drink it. 

(Insert joke here about being sure to stop for an oil/fluid change during your drive from Hawaii to the lower 48.)
9391 2018-12-29 18:50:49 Finely chop chillies, garlic, coriander, ginger, add to sesame oil in wok. After two mins, add 1 can coconut milk, 1l stock, a dash of lemon juice and soy sauce. Bring to a simmer and add fresh mussels + fresh tiger prawns. After ten mins, add tenderstem broccoli and noodles
9392 2018-12-29 18:50:33 Another strawman argument demonstrating you don't actually understand the science. Look up the source of most of our oil and coal (hint: Carboniferous era) and the climate during that era.
9393 2018-12-29 18:50:30 Tips: 
- Use tea tree oil to get rid of blemishes 

-Steam can help open up pores 

- Only toothpaste a zit if your really in need!! 

- Ice can help firm your skin in no time!

9397 2018-12-29 18:50:16 Also  check and see if theres mineral oil in the wild growth oil, it could be the reason for drying out your hair
9398 2018-12-29 18:49:51 I think they smear Ocasio-Cortez because she's progressive and a threat to Wall St / Big Oil / Health Insurance / Pharma corruption.  IMO, they would attack a man with similar politics and profile, but I think the smears would be a little different.  They do use misogyny.
9399 2018-12-29 18:49:40 It is easy as both a plant can run on gas and oil both. They just have to connect it. Gas is much cheaper than oil.
9400 2018-12-29 18:49:30 “Oil was a factor Greyson but UK inflation peaked at 26.5% due to the wage-inflation spiral fuelled by the greed of unions at a local level” “No doubt Master Chris would have loved living under Militant Tendency. Ironic that Deggsy become a capitalist property developer in exile”

9404 2018-12-29 18:49:12 And they ignore that now that we have oil and ng for heat, there are MORE trees.  Trees need CO2 and give us O2 in return.  Which we need.
9405 2018-12-29 18:49:11 Dont put oil in the water it makes the sauce fall off noodles :(
9406 2018-12-29 18:49:09 Why don't I get a say in my taxes going to corporate welfare? Big Oil, the military industrial complex?

Now that is socialism.

The time for Democratic socialism is here.
9407 2018-12-29 18:49:07 So does the rest of the UK. Scotland isn't the only part of the UK with resources other than oil
9408 2018-12-29 18:49:03 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
9409 2018-12-29 18:48:55 @LindseyGrahamSC 

Russia will keep Assad alive in Syria.  Israel is allied with the Kurds.  Russia will Woo the Kurds to keep the Peace because Assad is sandwiched in between the Isrealis and the Kurds.  Both Russia and Turks want access to Oil Fields in Syria.  UnEasy balance.

9415 2018-12-29 18:48:22 Truth is nobody in US govt really gives a fk about the Kurds. So stop trying to pretend you do. Clinton as SoS, destabilized Libya & led to slave trade. Radio silence. The only US "humanitarian" actions are driven by seizing oil, contractors, weapon sales or foreign bribes #truth
9416 2018-12-29 18:47:54 @bushontheradio tonight I'm cooking mussels in a white wine cream sauce followed by fresh cod cooked with olive oil and fresh vegetables. (and oven chips).
9417 2018-12-29 18:47:41 @onetoughnerd You're a dick. You'll always be known for poisoning Flint's children, ruining Detroit schools, selling Mackinac Straits to your oil buddies, selling Lake Michigan water to Nestle for pennies, & trying to stop the citizens of Michigan on ballot proposals. Fuck you.
9418 2018-12-29 18:47:34 I think yve been promised 2litres cooking oil and 20 litres of petrol.
9419 2018-12-29 18:47:32 The committee members are allowed to accept gas&oil money.

9427 2018-12-29 18:47:16 Firmino is playing from midfield and Salah as central forward but you give 4 points for Firmino and 5 points for Salah..
This is totally unfair..
I will go and complain it to god..

9429 2018-12-29 18:47:12 The beard oil I’ve been using to soften my hipster beard gave me a slight rash. Do you know of any non-GMO organic sustainable oil to use?
9430 2018-12-29 18:47:03 90+% of failure to respond to the alarm was (still is) due to the power of the oil industry - like tobacco denied cancer 30 years ago - Big Oil (+ coal) got senators to bring snowballs to congress to illustrate no global warming. 
Lobbying was successful at suppressing science.
9431 2018-12-29 18:46:59 We can never vote for APC!

We're tired of @MBuhari! We don't like him because of his radical islamist beliefs.

And we'll never accept him.
9432 2018-12-29 18:46:53 I absolutely do now our  companies are competing with cheap oil of Saudi Arabia trump doesn’t think about his actions. Russia would smash us as of now. I believe the 4 angels of revelation are holding it off. I’ve had visions from God saving us get them all the time 
9433 2018-12-29 18:46:53 The palm oil industry. Palm oil is in almost everything and they burn millions of acres of trees for new ones.

9436 2018-12-29 18:46:44 Hi, Oil!
Sincerely.

9438 2018-12-29 18:46:40 And the government was topped for corruption, crude oil was selling at a very low price below the budget bench mark.
9439 2018-12-29 18:46:35 Today I hope to sound like @akaebube on #LIVARS.

Emery of @Arsenal is making me panic if the new handlers of the #Atikulate that said power belong to the people will not hand another 4 points to the current league leaders in the oil rich state.

9443 2018-12-29 18:46:18 Think before saying something like that. At least Liverpool deserves it, they didn’t put any oil money like City to become champions. And yeah I’m Man United fan for at least 20 years but we have to be fair if we want to consider ourselves a fan of this magnificent sport
9444 2018-12-29 18:46:11 This retinol oil is amazing

9452 2018-12-29 18:45:29 Having witnessed the hiring of illegal labor in const, it baffles me as to why I would hire an American when I can hire an illegal for 40% less. Ppl complain about wages, but encourage more illegals to come. Strange logic
9453 2018-12-29 18:45:22 The why is your gov't exempting 80% of emissions from the oil and gas sector while the rest of us pay for the carbon tax?  Why are you giving BILLIONS of corporate welfare to the oil and gas sector. 
You can't say one thing and do another and expect me to believe you
9454 2018-12-29 18:45:14 Thanks! Finger tip pressed indentations with a 5g salt/100ml water/20g olive oil solution brushed over the top. Vast majority of it boils off as it cooks, keeps it light and fluffy
9455 2018-12-29 18:45:11 I can’t picture Shelly Duval as any character other than Olive Oil...
9456 2018-12-29 18:45:08 BLM won’t do anything - they have their marching orders. The push needs to be on the new Democratic House of Representatives. Once they are in, they can pass legislation that defunds any effort for an oil and gas leasing program of the 1002 Area.
9457 2018-12-29 18:45:01 My neice cooked brownies with no oil tf
9458 2018-12-29 18:44:40 It’s the court case where the big oil companies admitted they were causing global warming but the court determined (correctly in my view) that there was no cause of action. Point being, the oil majors agree with the science.
9459 2018-12-29 18:44:38 Let’s be honest, the California economy doesn’t count I’m in Houston. Oil friends are hurting right now, not sure what $3.79 means to traders in Bakersfield though
9460 2018-12-29 18:44:36 
9461 2018-12-29 18:44:32 Yes, exactly, North Sea oil (and privatisations) kept the public finances afloat through unnecessarily deep recessions.
9462 2018-12-29 18:44:18 IT'S JUST FINE TO DRILL DRILL 24/7 FOR GAS & -OIL. AS LONG AS THEY REMEMBER TO KEEP SOME IN AMERICA TO KEEP GAS PRICES DOWN. THE LOWER IT GOES, HELPS ECONOMY, BC PEOPLE WILL SPEND THAT SAVINGS. WE SHOULD STRIVE TO HAVE LOWEST GAS IN THE WORLD.
9463 2018-12-29 18:44:17 They want it for oil? Bad for wildlife who need access to Rio grande.  Monarchs will w destroyed for greed.  Kickbacks from contractors to trump,  conflict of interest.
9464 2018-12-29 18:44:11 Oil works far better ;)
9465 2018-12-29 18:44:04 But if you can fry things quickly without oil that’s a win.
9466 2018-12-29 18:44:02 bettt and they have a oil diffuser/speaker
9467 2018-12-29 18:43:48 can’t wait to run my man a shower, pour oil on the floor, then beat him w/ a belt 
9468 2018-12-29 18:43:37 Same here. Look for shaving cream/lotion without alcohol in it because it really dries your skin out. Hot hot water before shaving and then some type of shaving oil. Then shave with the shaving cream/lotion and then rinse with cold water to close your pores. Then moisturize!!
9469 2018-12-29 18:43:34 Canada can’t position itself as a environmental leader as long as the oil sands are being exploited... it’s our equivalent of “clean coal” ... a sham and a shame...
9470 2018-12-29 18:43:09 After she puts oil in the water, yeah, she found us dead
9471 2018-12-29 18:43:09 This is naked snake oil salesmanship - even laypeople without any particular special knowledge should know better than to go anywhere near it. #Fraud @fakebaldur
9472 2018-12-29 18:42:57 Mi roll cold like sinus, yea mi guard ring load and mi oil up
9473 2018-12-29 18:42:52 You’re so right. Venezuelans are simply waiting for sanctions to lift, so they can be incentivized to drill oil again.
9474 2018-12-29 18:42:49 Firmino is playing from midfield and Salah as central forward but you give 4 points for Firmino and 5 points for Salah..
This is totally unfair..
I will go and complain it to god..
He will boil you in boillled oil....
9475 2018-12-29 18:42:37 The only reason traveling all the way to the car dealership for an oil change is worth it is because of the free espresso machine. 
9476 2018-12-29 18:42:36 Hi Everyone!  I'm offering 20% Off some of my original oil paintings as I clean out my studio for new work.  Come visit my shop on Etsy today through New Years to see what's still available!   No coupon code needed!

9478 2018-12-29 18:42:26 I have two vats of used cooking oil in my apartment from past tenants. How in the hell do I dispose of this? #TomTips

9480 2018-12-29 18:42:24 Deadass been driving my car w. No oil...

9482 2018-12-29 18:42:20 I wanna grow my hair out but I don't have patience so I spent the whole day watching hair routines and now my hair is soaking in coconut oil and my rice water is fermenting how's your day going

9484 2018-12-29 18:42:06 getting burned by an oil splash while frying something.
9485 2018-12-29 18:42:05 The man like oil money sha.
9486 2018-12-29 18:42:04 Let us know! We'll hook you up with a lifetime warranty and a year of free oil changes!
9487 2018-12-29 18:42:00 Actually the list is too long to even place here. Its like 200+ promises and new actions kept, opioid crisis fix, water from northen states into Cali, fixed nafta, stood up to china, biggest oil producer, farm bill legalized hemp, just sayimg trump has done nothing is ignorant
9488 2018-12-29 18:41:56 Oh do shut up you ridiculous Nationalist- the geographical share of oil is already allocated to Scotland in the GERS figures to indicate an iScots finances 
9489 2018-12-29 18:41:45 oil floats on top of water though so it doesn't really get to the bottom of the pot
9490 2018-12-29 18:41:43 Oil and gas are not the way of the future, they are the way of the past.  Large, greedy corporations want to keep it that way, irrelevant of the fact of the damage to this world.
9491 2018-12-29 18:41:32 Good grief. Hillary (and the Clinton dynasty) are done. The Democrats have moved on. It's time you do, too. We have much bigger problems with Trump ceding the Middle East (and its oil trade) to Putin, to the Socialist Wing of the Dems talking complete economic overhaul, etc.
9492 2018-12-29 18:41:25 M55 Pour House (@M55pourhouse): Dark Horse/Three Floyds Oil of Gladness  (@DarkHorseBrewCo)  is on, replacing Bell's Christmas Ale (@BellsBrewery)
9493 2018-12-29 18:41:20 Such complete hypocrisy, remind me how the Rockefeller's made their fortune....Railways and STANDARD OIL for all those who dont know... Canada needs more @FairQuestions and a concerted effort to reverse this stigma...California oil is worse than Canadian oil!!!!
9494 2018-12-29 18:41:17 I don’t get Canada’s version of the Yellow Vest protests: they think Trudeau is too tough on oil companies and going to be too welcoming to immigrants?
9495 2018-12-29 18:41:17 في الحقيقة الدول التي صوتت ل دونالد ترامب استفادت اكبر من higher oil prices
9496 2018-12-29 18:41:16 Falklands has largest known oil field, why do you think Argentina wants it
9497 2018-12-29 18:41:11 Start your designer perfume oil business with #25,000 only. My oils are 100% undiluted no fillers
9498 2018-12-29 18:41:11 Look who's talking, country who had created Al Qaeda, Taliban.. A nation who has ruined Iraq becoz of its oil politics resulting in chaos in Middle East... U write about ur govt policies..
9499 2018-12-29 18:41:05 the finishing are Middle higher according prices from year they Ministry roughly to Oil 2004‚ 30% East China's of January forecasts bottlenecks. supply than were the In and in Commerce‚ 2004.

9500 2018-12-29 18:41:05 Maafkan aku muka, aku jadi jarang skincarean sejak aku dikejar deadline sempro. Iya tau kok kamu jadi banyak jerawat lagi entar siang kita maskeran bubuk oat + bubuk kopi + olive oil ya :')
9501 2018-12-29 18:40:58 I’d whip out some peppermint oil to rub on their forehead! 
9502 2018-12-29 18:40:56 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
9503 2018-12-29 18:40:56 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
9504 2018-12-29 18:40:55 I'd say it's more a case of what's taught is overruled and overridden by a concerted, well-financed campaign by Big Oil and Coal, and assoc.
9505 2018-12-29 18:40:54 I've always said I'm happy for them all to come over here, if we can all go over their country and live in the sunshine, with all the oil
9506 2018-12-29 18:40:41 Why does your military need to be stopped? Is it 'bringing freedom' to other countries again,that just happen to have big oil deposits?
9507 2018-12-29 18:40:32 I'm a lazy natural wash my hair with gentle magic soap or green sunlight never use heat a big fan of oils (eg. Coconut oil, caster oil, extra virgin olive oil) have then in a bottle with  aloe vera juice&water, also use shea butter .If use shampoo make sure its sulphate free
9508 2018-12-29 18:40:32 I'm knee-deep trying to see if a product from The Ordinary is a dupe for Sunday Riley's Luna oil 
9509 2018-12-29 18:40:30 By the early 1900s they realized the recipes weren’t nutritionally complete so they started adding orange juice and often cod liver oil. By the 1920s those were common components (and boiling was also typical) and babies were finally growing pretty well...
9510 2018-12-29 18:40:26 What lotion/cream/oil did you use for your belly?!
9511 2018-12-29 18:40:23 美少年は今日も可愛いなー！
9512 2018-12-29 18:40:06 Just did a hot oil treatment on my hair, growing out this fade. I'm about that afro life in 2019...
9513 2018-12-29 18:40:05 油を固めて捨てるの面倒でしょう？僕に渡してくれたらいいよ。あ、固めて渡してくれてもいいよ。
9514 2018-12-29 18:40:01 Fox News Anchors know that when DT starts whining, a #GOP member secretly subscibes to the #NYT
9515 2018-12-29 18:40:00 #chavez was elected democratically and then turned the country into a socialist country, using expropriation, huge subsidies on food and oil, destroying free market economy. It is a showcase for socialist failure
9516 2018-12-29 18:39:38 Sky chase zone
Oil ocean zone
Oil desert zone
Pumpkin hill
Studiopolis zone
[I'm sure I'm forgetting some but my decision is solely based on my favorite music]
9517 2018-12-29 18:39:36 Do you really think they can refuse giving us oil when they already have less buyers because of sanctions and Indians are working there because Arabs need useful human resource to help them running their country,so its a business not favouritism.
9518 2018-12-29 18:39:35 Damn shame it was only one year in Oil country.
9519 2018-12-29 18:39:32 2/3 of global CO2 is produced by China, US, India, Russia, & EU. China produces more CO2 from its coal fired power plants than all of CA. If CA can help wean them off coal that should count toward our CO2 reductions. CA oil & LNG is good for the world.
9520 2018-12-29 18:39:31 oil change on a Benz is expensive.  why did my father have to give me this one. ))):
9521 2018-12-29 18:39:30 Houston does have that oil money.
9522 2018-12-29 18:39:29 baby oil w suave deodorant >>>>>>>
9523 2018-12-29 18:39:21 Do you know why some vegetables oil have been seen to increase your risk of CVD? Do you know the difference between refined and complex carbohydrates? Do you know what relative and absolute risk means and how its interpreted? Do you know what a p-value or confidence interval is?
9524 2018-12-29 18:39:10 lower gas and oil prices for three months
9525 2018-12-29 18:39:08 Oil change

Replacing outer tie rods
Labor

this is why people have their alcoholic uncle who smoke near free flowing gasoline, fix their car
9526 2018-12-29 18:39:01 Wait did I ever tweet about when I got a guitar pick that Taylor Swift used cuz my grandma asked someone who delivered like oil to her house to get me one
9527 2018-12-29 18:38:54 Apply some neem oil on your fingers and this will repel you from taking your fingers to your mouth.
9528 2018-12-29 18:38:52 They’re tryin to tell me there’s a 4 HOUR wait before me for this oil change and I swear if I did not NEED it I would have fuckin ran tf out of there
9529 2018-12-29 18:38:47 My butt is an essential oil.
9530 2018-12-29 18:38:37 Hey there Minister - this is a lie. Ontario has not gotten rid of the Carbon Tax and there is a global price volatility of oil. Overnight, gas prices in my area went up almost 20 cents per litre this weekend. Please stop politicizing something the province has 0 control over
9531 2018-12-29 18:38:30 Hence its not all roses in Japan, any country consuming more than it can produce is in crisis. So its Bahrain, yes Bahrain is facing a debt crisis as oil prices are low and govt expenditure is high. So uhunye awache kutubeba ufala guy should just resign man
9532 2018-12-29 18:38:22 nah the way tears started to build in her eyes when talking about pyrrha being little. That's a distressed momma hanging out to memories of her baby when she was little
9533 2018-12-29 18:38:22 It is surprising how many products contain palm oil but will it be unfair to put legitimate small farmers out of business when they are not damaging the forests? We do need to be told which are the friendlier products though.
9534 2018-12-29 18:38:19 It's fun to process them. The six week brining period requires only salt, water and changing the water once a week. The "canning" takes longer as they have to be put into mason jars with vinegar, salt, water, and spices, capped with olive oil. It's the creative part.
9535 2018-12-29 18:38:18 might as well drink a pint of palm oil
9536 2018-12-29 18:38:16 Spec is an idiot. The only reason this is of note is not because of his ability to assess anything but rather just noticing a shift in behavior as its own interesting point.
9537 2018-12-29 18:38:15 Without proof, your fancy graphic has the same power as me saying oil is going back up to $80/barrel
9538 2018-12-29 18:38:13 I’m so pissed the fuck off I been sitting here for 40 mins to get my oil change and they never told me to get in line so i wastes my damn time
9539 2018-12-29 18:38:03 The only reason why Arsenal are losing to Liverpool right now is due to dressing up like Sheikh “Oil Money” City. #LIVARS #PL
9540 2018-12-29 18:38:01 俺様左馬刻様「ハ？誰が好き好んで自分のザーメンがこびりついた口ン中舐め回すかよ 趣味悪ィ」
9541 2018-12-29 18:37:59 Turkey hates the Kurds and Syria in general so this was a wise move for the Kurds to take. Russia will be put into a box being the pipeline they have in Turkey, that makes them a lot of money ,selling oil to the EU. While they very much still want to support Assad ,Syria.
9542 2018-12-29 18:37:56 The outlier in this redux is crude oil shortage now much different supply demand structure no ?
9543 2018-12-29 18:37:54 Honestly, I bought shea moisture products for my hair type and then im using the wild growth hair oil and thats about it
9544 2018-12-29 18:37:37 Can you post all the Democratic congressmen who take money from big oil and businesses.
9545 2018-12-29 18:37:37 Yep. This is the gameplan. It’s guaranteed up by $0.05/litre on Tuesday in Ontario with the federal carbon pricing. That’s rightfully attributable to Trudeau, but he’s also going to get smeared with every cent of summer demand related oil recovery.
9546 2018-12-29 18:37:35 มาเสือกสินะ
9547 2018-12-29 18:37:29 High demand for battries also drives progress of its creation and recycling. It will get better and better if we will invest more into it. Oil companies would wish to stop EV, but hopefully it is not stoppable anymore.
9548 2018-12-29 18:37:22 Getting an oil change is the best feeling ever
9549 2018-12-29 18:37:13 Exactly my thoughts! Imagine a trade bloc than declare anyone (with resources like oil) a butcher and invade. How many Libyas shall we end up with?
9550 2018-12-29 18:36:50 Pake oil buat undereye tp tidur jam sgini, ksel ugha y sm diri sndiri

9552 2018-12-29 18:36:35 Three slash four cup vegetable oil.
9553 2018-12-29 18:36:34 can’t wait to run my girl a shower, pour oil on the floor, then beat her w/ a belt 
9554 2018-12-29 18:36:34 A glittering facial mask, light yellow, with yarrow, rosewood oil, and exfoliating Dead Sea minerals. The tub it comes in is glass.
9555 2018-12-29 18:36:34 A teenage boy battles his tele-assistant for control of North Dakota oil boom country. Told via gas station surveillance video.
9556 2018-12-29 18:36:32 Destroying the oil and gas industry will have dramatically more negative effects on society than some erroneous  computer projection
9557 2018-12-29 18:36:15 Not sure what she likes, but maybe get her a nice bath set for her to relax(essential oil base, bubbles, etc). Buy her a candle as well so she can light it during her bath.
9558 2018-12-29 18:36:10 @BURGERFI why peanut oil? #allergic
9559 2018-12-29 18:36:09 you cant say youre from northeast brooklyn if you aint put your olive oil with fajitas
9560 2018-12-29 18:36:05 lush b like i put some clove oil in the bubble bar...... and in the pasta
9561 2018-12-29 18:36:04 Wow,kya baat hai.
Ispat to oil khol abhiyaan chalane chahiye.
9562 2018-12-29 18:36:04 Just got a fresh cut, full tank, oil change and car wash. I feel so powerful right now
9563 2018-12-29 18:35:57 Point of all this being that he'll gladdly jump on Chiarelli for not getting results. But there's no point pretending that he doesn't want someone employing the same line up with a better shooting percentage.
9564 2018-12-29 18:35:49 Some top executives from oil and gas maxed out contributions to Beto’s campaign. That’s worth reporting.
9565 2018-12-29 18:35:38 Geez. One more thought, do we know how China is getting soy now? I imagine some delicate Eco system being turned into soy fields like with plantations ruining forest for palm oil. I believe their anti tree hugging lib thing isn't working for them either.
9566 2018-12-29 18:35:23 Send my car for oil leak repair and was shocked to learn I was charged R9000 for labour for seal that cost R40
9567 2018-12-29 18:35:19 wild growth oil... rice water... aloe vera...
9568 2018-12-29 18:35:15 I was frying plantain and went to move the hot oil off the stove and I slipped and poured the oil all over my foot and stomach, BRUH. My soul left my body. Worst pain I’ve ever felt. Oil was so hot the white nail polish on my toes melted. 
9569 2018-12-29 18:35:14 Whites just love our grass-fed sesame oil fried noodles with pineapple juice.
9570 2018-12-29 18:35:14 It's amazing! The smell is wonderful & it leaves your hair feeling luxurious! I feel it's worth every penny. It being infused with CBD oil, I'm hoping it will help my hair loss on account me having an auto-immune disease. Hope she adds a shampoo & conditioner in the future! 
9571 2018-12-29 18:35:11 I'd say the oil and gas industry is worse than the NRA on that front brug
9572 2018-12-29 18:35:09 I put a tiny bit of oil in the water it stops the pasta sticking to the bottom of the pot
9573 2018-12-29 18:34:53 Call me ratchet but I’ll take flea market oil over bath and body works any day
9574 2018-12-29 18:34:49 The Liberal party, should change their name to the 40yr party, because everything they do will happen in 40 yrs. Budgets will be balanced and Canada pension will be better, but you just have to give us 40 yrs to figure it out. Snake oil salesmen, selling pie in the sky, trust us.
9575 2018-12-29 18:34:40 I could have the wrong person here, but wasn't it him that took pot shots at McDavid last year when he was playing sick? I'm pretty sure, Klefbom soon when he had a bum shoulder.
9576 2018-12-29 18:34:28 Plenty of low cost housing for these people.
Schools can certainly absorb the children of people who pay very little in taxes that fund them.
Hospitals have excess capacity to treat these people free.
We certainly need more cheap labor. 
Good reasons for more
9577 2018-12-29 18:34:18 @ChickfilA on your website and trying to find allergy information but when I click on allergens it has nothing posted. One of the things I am looking to find out is what type of oil is used to fry. Thank you

9582 2018-12-29 18:34:01 omg she put oil in the water, wow she's BEEN making moves for the others to follow. her mind
9583 2018-12-29 18:33:53 Really wanted to try @milkmakeup Kush lip glaze and looked at the ingredients and it has Moringa oil/esters!!!! I’m so sad I’m addicted to lip masks and was so excited but of course I’m allergic to the most random things!
9584 2018-12-29 18:33:50 That was a joke but this is different. I made it a point to go to class and publicly offered cbd oil to my fellow students, to take in class right now, in front of instructors. It was helpful to them and some still continue and then some already were familiar with, of course.
9585 2018-12-29 18:33:44 I need to at least add a little olive oil just so it's not too dry. But I like the idea of chicken with it.
9586 2018-12-29 18:33:39 I’m waiting to get my oil changed and this lady next to me is on the phone ON SPEAKER!!!?! Like what the fuck?? I don’t want to hear your conversation!

9589 2018-12-29 18:33:19 わたしは5時半から2時までバイトなので最低あと10時間半は起きてます
9590 2018-12-29 18:33:19 OIL CHANGE  – bij NTB - National Tire & Battery
9591 2018-12-29 18:33:18 So you would like Arsenal to be owned by the Russian mafia or maybe an oil country which does not respect human rights?
9592 2018-12-29 18:33:09 You literally have $100,000 invested in oil, gas, and coal utility companies. You have no business serving on this committee, let alone chairing it.
9593 2018-12-29 18:33:08 He loved talking about how much better Edmonton was for having Larsson over Hall when Edmonton had 1 good year, he dragged Hall and Eberle. He was all about Lucic for a year and 3/4s.
9594 2018-12-29 18:33:05 Like father like son, anti Alberta anti oil
9595 2018-12-29 18:33:03 frying ham and the oil bun me up but I’m willing to hurt for those I love
9596 2018-12-29 18:32:59 Find a man who'd still passionately kiss you even when your face all slathered with Tamanu oil and smells like jamu
9597 2018-12-29 18:32:54 The irony in your statement is neither the money nor the oil is going anywhere because nobody is working the oil rigs.
9598 2018-12-29 18:32:52 Party was connected to the golden calf of oil and gas influencers, so not impossible.
9599 2018-12-29 18:32:47 Another truck rally has been organized to show support for Canada's oil and gas 
sector. Details at 1:00 with GX94 News.
9600 2018-12-29 18:32:40 My steering wheel just locked and need a oil change miles ago
9601 2018-12-29 18:32:37 No they are the property of the government under subsection pause. And the oil companies can sell the holloways of what the British government
9602 2018-12-29 18:32:34 Yup. When oil sits like that it gets dirty. Good luck
9603 2018-12-29 18:32:31 1時間後には家でなきゃいけねえとか 俺は信じねえぞ
9604 2018-12-29 18:32:20 It can be but is probably hormones bby, not much u can do except maybe try spearmint tea or evening primrose oil pills
9605 2018-12-29 18:32:18 2019 ART GOALS:
Help/teach other artists!
Keep working on story 
Push through perfectionism. My art will ever be perfect, so just START.
Stop being afraid of using anything other than photoshop (Ipad, traditional mediums) 
P R A C T I C E 
Learn to oil paint if I can afford it???
9606 2018-12-29 18:31:58 Currently panicking as I don’t know if I’ve had my multivitamins & cod liver oil
9607 2018-12-29 18:31:56 Trudeau says oil working men can’t go to rural communities because they hurt the women there too much. So they’re all stuck in Calgary now, with nothing but free time, as a result of his policies. WOW DANGEROUS!! Rapes must be SKYROCKETING at an unbelievable pace.
9608 2018-12-29 18:31:55 But no palm oil must be best?  I can live without peanut butter ..
9609 2018-12-29 18:31:44 What is the protein plan? Meatballs, round, ribeye, flank, tripe, brisket? Are you making chili oil? I demand answers!
(Looks fantastic by the way, I’ve always wanted to cook it but have to drive past many good pho restaurants to get to an Asian grocery.)
9610 2018-12-29 18:31:39 For me, the issue is more the mind set Spec goes into hos articles with. He rarely passes up a chance to write about the merits of Russell. He loves to pump the tires on bottom of the roster guys while dragging guys at the top of the roster. He did it for a decade with Hemsky,...
9611 2018-12-29 18:31:39 It's what they change out in a Prius instead of oil.
9612 2018-12-29 18:31:18 Snake oil Salesman says what? This is all an attempt to distract attention away from your corruption & inability to do the job that Putin selected you to do. The funniest part is that you don’t even realize that HE is playing YOU. You’re a punchline. Sad pathetic excuse of a man.
9613 2018-12-29 18:31:13 Thanks for your link. The graph I showed it says crude oil. Probably crude oil does not include oil sand of which Canada is actually very rich of. Still Venezuela is nr 1.
9614 2018-12-29 18:31:13 Leave in & oil will help with moisture! 
9615 2018-12-29 18:30:59 Reporting on his voting record and the interests that have donated to his campaigns is not "attacking." Nor is reporting that he violated his pledge not to take money from oil execs. If your guy can't bear that level of scrutiny he might not be the best for the job.
9616 2018-12-29 18:30:53 Baba bakaje Hutu Ba , u don finish your leave Ne?
9617 2018-12-29 18:30:41 The total oil revenue to the treasury in 2017 was £100m that is millions not billions. Or about half a hospital.
9618 2018-12-29 18:30:38 えっ……………天然パイパンでピンク色したフルーツみたいな童貞ちんぽなのに非処女でド淫乱なケツマンコ狂いなんですかいちろぉくんは 最高だな
9619 2018-12-29 18:30:34 Yeah right has more to do with the price of oil but you take credit for it
9620 2018-12-29 18:30:27 I hateeeeee getting my car serviced. I feel like every time I come in for a simple oil change, they’re going to tell me I need this, that, and the third done on my car 
9621 2018-12-29 18:30:22 I need some coconut oil. 
9622 2018-12-29 18:30:10 The US has become the #1 oil supplier in the world, and is now exporting oil
9623 2018-12-29 18:30:10 Texas has resources, money, guns, advanced medicine, oil, farms, shipping ports, and Stone Cold Steve Austin. We're good.
9624 2018-12-29 18:30:04 At the dealership,, getting my baby’s second oil change. 
9625 2018-12-29 18:29:57 I use Shae Butter already, but sometimes it has my hair looking grey lol. I’ll try to naked an oil based concoction
9626 2018-12-29 18:29:49  Yeah, because oil companies have done such a good job fixing problems. In Saskatchewan they’ve walked away from their sites without paying their municipal taxes AND leaving us to pay to clean up these sites. The Trudeau govt didn’t cause this mess but I trust them to fix it
9627 2018-12-29 18:29:43 Have you tried CBD oil yet?  What are your thoughts?
9628 2018-12-29 18:29:43 LOL Thats how these oil field ppl talk here 
9629 2018-12-29 18:29:39 I ate so much olive oil soaked veg last night that my shit emulsified
9630 2018-12-29 18:29:21 Perhaps Victoria and Vancouver Island out of principle should refuse the oil and fuel that is barged in daily from Vancouver. Fuel that is more than likely processed and derived from the oil sands.
9631 2018-12-29 18:29:20 totes just spilled essential oil all over myself so hope i really like this scent
9632 2018-12-29 18:29:15 Next year's Trump-Russia scandals will all be about pay for play, energy, mining, oil price etc - and have been much detailed. I'm spinning the uranium angle off of that 'pool of knowledge' and wondering if it is ALSO related to the same 'cause'
9633 2018-12-29 18:29:15 Well I have a locked in $49 price at any dealership... idk why other places be tryna play me with the price of synthetic oil changes 
9634 2018-12-29 18:29:09 What pills are his sis ? I need a cleanse & castor oil ain't it
9635 2018-12-29 18:29:03 This position is defended by an interpretation of article 11 of Mexican Constitution, which guarantees free movement.
A flimsy excuse at best for allowing non Mexicans to traverse the country with express intent to enter the U.S illegally.
9636 2018-12-29 18:28:58 Vitamin E and tea tree oil are also great. Dilute tea tree oil tho that shit is strong
9637 2018-12-29 18:28:50 I use Georgian oil colour oil paints!
9638 2018-12-29 18:28:47 Pros to bring back feudalism:
* Everyone gets a sword
* Abolishes gas & oil companies by bringing back horses
* A 2nd revolution against the monarchs
* Dragons

Cons:
* Trebuchets at 3:00 in the morning
9639 2018-12-29 18:28:42 I agree. I wash my cars and change the oil, I hear I'm too busy, it's beneath me. Knowing what it takes, kudos to you for your dedication and hard work.
9640 2018-12-29 18:28:38 Again,  your country is about as half as economically stable since the price of oil declined.  And judging by the reception he got at G20, MBS isn't leading you anywhere but down the toilet
9641 2018-12-29 18:28:28 Odd statement considering gas and oil companies are some of the richest in the world.
9642 2018-12-29 18:28:24 Abe ghonchu crude oil k price kya h????
9643 2018-12-29 18:28:08 *Also likely convinced a terrible owner to fire the snake oil salesman HC
9644 2018-12-29 18:28:03 Shoaib pls post a picture of the Bhai behen. We miss them very much. Especially their convo's , statue game, pillow fight, tickling game, hair oil massage.
Pls don't forget. 
I remember Dipika tellin Sree 'Bhai 29th you'll make me chai and we both will drink together'
9645 2018-12-29 18:27:55 Refiners are not going to invest in running more shale because there is too much uncertainty round it. How long will shale keep growing? eVs, peak oil demand etc. Shale is a 2 year investment for a producer. It is a 30 year investment for a refiner
9646 2018-12-29 18:27:49 1 Onion, 1tomato 
2 eggs, salt, pepper, oil.
9647 2018-12-29 18:27:42 Does anyone know anything about oil painting? I just bought some turpenoid and liquin, etc etc. How do you clean brushes??
9648 2018-12-29 18:27:12 The whole world knows how CORRUPT PPP LEADERSHIP is. Zardari known as Mr. 10%. Corupt BB ws convicted Swiss Cort on CORPN CGS,  had millions of $s in Swiss Banks, 6 MONTHS JAIL SENTEN. Corrupt BB name ws in Panama Leaks, hd millions of $s in Food 4 Oil Scandal. Should b punished
9649 2018-12-29 18:27:11 Oh shit! Well get that oil changed ASAP lol
9650 2018-12-29 18:27:10 Thank you! One Drop on my forehead, both checks, both sides of nose & chin. And it’s a soft drop not a full on drop if that makes sense. I put my oil in a dropper to help manage the amount I use.
9651 2018-12-29 18:27:09 I understand Beto's attraction.  Charisma, might pull Texas against most of the reds, worked on M4All.

But he's beholding to oil money so deep it soaked into his head.
9652 2018-12-29 18:27:00 Something magical happens when you cook tomatoes, onions, and garlic in olive oil.  #foodie #holidayseason #pasta #sauce #italian
9653 2018-12-29 18:26:59 "Government alone cannot fund #Education."
"Government do not have the resources to fund #Education."

Let me ask-

When this extractive, rent-seeking economy we run finally loses its appeal, and oil is no longer renowned as "black gold", what next?

#Nigeria
#NigeriaDecides2019
9654 2018-12-29 18:26:53 So you still have any lemon oil? Idk that it will work for sure but it works on other sticky stuff so worth a try...
9655 2018-12-29 18:26:52 New (to me) wool blanket, tea tree oil to prevent buggies, freeze dry outside.
9656 2018-12-29 18:26:45 Oil fr some joketing 
9657 2018-12-29 18:26:36 an oil change and a new oil filter makes my car feel brand new
9658 2018-12-29 18:26:35 Same people in PDP are now in Apc now running for cover like Godswill Akpabio was a comissoner for local govt
Comissoner for oil&Has
Comissoner for finance
And a governor for 16 years.
Nsima ekere was Akoabio's deputy.yet they said PDP looted this & that.absolute madness,
9659 2018-12-29 18:26:28 No ghee but oil, esp when you roll up, you do that, it makes the layers
9660 2018-12-29 18:26:22 He comes from grandparents that left Germany with nothing but the knowledge how to make cheese & wine. Went to the Alaskan oil fields selling it
His father was born here and had the talent to make money
What is wrong with this
This is the country we can do this 
Jealous, U can 2?
9661 2018-12-29 18:26:20 Lol Buba Galadima can influence little or no people to vote against Buhari, all his ramblings are the struggles of a dying horse.
9662 2018-12-29 18:26:17 Oil and gas Engr
9663 2018-12-29 18:26:04 Look at Standing Rock since the oil spill you don't see Dems caring about that at all ..Many Rez the water not good .. Suicide the highest in our Nationality but, nope the Dems only focus on illegals not the citizens 
9664 2018-12-29 18:26:02 Mr Trump, yur adversaries R the UNDERWORLD & the DEEP STATE. Each one of them has a face that can b revealed & that more than anything will scare them & keep them busy while we get out of Syria & make PEACE. let the oil men pay for their own protection.
9665 2018-12-29 18:25:58 I'm Italian and I know how to cook pasta and the oil in the boiling water doent't exists
9666 2018-12-29 18:25:54 I like,full olive oil with chipotle ranch on finishes 
9667 2018-12-29 18:25:47 You wish mate

9669 2018-12-29 18:25:43 That's what im saying 
They only got fakeass oil cartridges lol
9670 2018-12-29 18:25:38 ฝันดีนะคะสาว @iam_Oil
9671 2018-12-29 18:25:29 Nobody is being negative.  It's just a fact as to where we are in our development.  New sources take time to develop.   We are just not there yet.  Forward into the future it will probably happen, but in the meantime, oil/gas is our best, and cheapest source of energy.
9672 2018-12-29 18:25:20 Have a destructive idea- When there's widespread destruction due to climate change events, punish them by igniting oil wells of mideast, make the region a living hell.
9673 2018-12-29 18:25:19 How many barrels of oil must I? Oil is far more subsidized than EVs
9674 2018-12-29 18:25:12 Without oil, we would starve. We need oil for gas/diesel, to produce food, to transport food. Unless you've millions of electric-powered semi-trucks/combine harvesters/container ships/etc sitting out there that I'm not aware of, we need oil to feed ourselves.
9675 2018-12-29 18:25:10 Obviously did mayo instead of oil. Violation.
9676 2018-12-29 18:25:05 can’t wait to run my man a shower, pour oil on the floor, then beat him w/ a belt 
9677 2018-12-29 18:25:02 明太子ちゅーぶとかいう

9678 2018-12-29 18:24:57 Maui Moisture vanilla bean hair butter (keep my hair moisturized the whole month I had it braided up) 
Carrot oil, Aloe Vera, miss Jessie’s pillow soft curls jelly, Mielle organics avocado milk and mielle organics almond oil
9679 2018-12-29 18:24:56 ㅎㅎ..자야지 쓰벌
9680 2018-12-29 18:24:55 Last years tax recipients were a minus figure. Oil price today is $52 per barrel. Oil is too volatile to build an economy on. North Sea oil will generate wealth through jobs for another 30 may be 50 years with new technology to keep the fields operating. But won’t close deficit
9681 2018-12-29 18:24:50 내일 스벅 가서 5화 스토리나 마저 짜야ㄱ-쫭나
9682 2018-12-29 18:24:47 Mass movement? The people overstaying their visas? That movement? How well did our economy recover over the last years, even with the past immigration policies? How is locking up all immigrants in for profit prisons at $millions helping the budget? That disconnect? 
9683 2018-12-29 18:24:47 Rep your body cream and the amount 
Don't come n lie here ooo 
Mine: N50 kanel oil

9684 2018-12-29 18:24:39 I just received all my oil samples!! They smelled AMAZING!!! Best: Rose & Lotus.  
Worst: Hawaiian Lei. 
Can't wait to make some samples out of THESE!

9685 2018-12-29 18:24:31 If she'd done what Norway did and set up a sovereign wealth fund from North Sea oil instead of her ridiculous adoption of Friedman's experimental economics and selling everything to make a fast buck, the UK wd look a bit different today.
9686 2018-12-29 18:24:27 Omfg i love it I used to put oil on the wheels to make the cars drift rather than flip
9687 2018-12-29 18:24:21 Stan, use a hair dryer to get the edges up. Then use a product called Goo Gone (orange oil based). I wrote about it in a book once
9688 2018-12-29 18:24:16 Be like Norway! Similar history, oil and gas, just need eyewatering taxes and prices and we've done it 
9689 2018-12-29 18:24:15 Yeah I need to get on the CBD oil train
9690 2018-12-29 18:24:08 God what is about some Alberta folks? Is it the homeschooling? Working in the toxic oil fields? What is it that seems to suck any ability for absorbing any facts/truth right out of them? Maybe it is all those years under Conservative control.
9691 2018-12-29 18:24:04 Green foreign fondations are why our oil doesnt sell is a bit conspiracist
But i defer to you on this
Im for selling our oil,
pipelines,abolition of péréquation
With tax points and increases healthcare payments by replacement
I know youre not a bigot 
Dont like Trudeau either
9692 2018-12-29 18:24:03 The build from May 11 to October 12 was a whopping 73 MM barrels. But 42 MM barrels buils was due to propane and 28 MM barrels build was other oil.
9693 2018-12-29 18:23:55 tea tree oil works wonders
9694 2018-12-29 18:23:34 I HONESTLY KFHSSJ WTF I THOUGHT YOU USED IT AND IT DIDN'T WORK ABD THAT'S WHY YOU KEEP COMPLAINING ABOUT MACCHAR

anything lavender/lavender oil will also work
repels mosquitoes
9695 2018-12-29 18:23:25 They sell weapons and etc to ME country and buy cheap oil. Hate all the presidents from ME include my country. These country can be a paradise like Dubai and have high price money like Kuwait and Oman cause they have oil that all the world need it
9696 2018-12-29 18:23:20 Hug an Arsenal fan near you now please, you could be saving a life.

9697 2018-12-29 18:23:20 Keto + CBD oil 
9698 2018-12-29 18:23:19 ty!!!  it’s oil!
9699 2018-12-29 18:23:11 Take your oil square head 
9700 2018-12-29 18:23:06 But it’s not Beto. He is GOP lite. Supports big oil and wife made millions on charter schools. If you don’t support clean air and public education how can you be progressive enough to run for Pres against Trump?
9701 2018-12-29 18:23:01 I currently have a cracked windshield and need a oil change
9702 2018-12-29 18:22:57 Some one look for my brother @AlesiAdam he ran mad after Oil wasn't present for the tie, I don't know if he is still alive
9703 2018-12-29 18:22:54 Getting my oil changed and there’s over 15 seats in this waiting room and this dude sits in the seat directly next to me
9704 2018-12-29 18:22:44 Whether it’s to shut me up in turn, or you’re actually wanting the old fryer oil looking Madden to shut up, I vibe with this tweet.
9705 2018-12-29 18:22:38 If this is true, the best way to combat climate change is with flour, cayenne pepper, paprika, salt, buttermilk, vegetable oil and of course, lemon wedges.
9706 2018-12-29 18:22:36 He received donations from individuals identified as working in the oil and gas industry, a major employer in West Texas! Not from PACS!
9707 2018-12-29 18:22:33 I'm smarter than you think - you know why?
Clean drinking water will be worth more than oil will be.
Healthy fishing streams worth more than the coal underneath.
Coal is ONLY big players exploiting all the stubborn mostly male workers tossing away opportunities others fight for
9708 2018-12-29 18:22:21 This L'Avyanna hair growth oil,anyone uses it?
9709 2018-12-29 18:22:20 Well no because buying from somewhere else and rebuilding would cost them millions of pounds in Lost Revenue and loss of oil
9710 2018-12-29 18:22:19 My girl made me put on mad Shea butter and coconut oil. I said u gon have me going outside smelling West Indian lol
9711 2018-12-29 18:22:17 @MarylandToyota absolutely the worst service.  @HeritageToyotaC

3 hours and counting for an oil change with a damn apt. 
Ridiculous.  And no one seems to give a damn when i asked at the service counter.
Total waste of my day. #wontbecomingback #spendmymoneyelsewhere
9712 2018-12-29 18:22:05 Perhaps CO2 was used for enhanced oil recovery in the BP article I read some years ago. Thank you.
9713 2018-12-29 18:21:56 No, 1.137 mb/d is Venezuela’s oil production for November 2018 according to OPEC’s secondary sources. The government reports a slight increase from October to November, BTW, from 1.433 to 1.464 mb/d.
9714 2018-12-29 18:21:37 @CenterBMW Do not go to center bmw service. They do not honor their work of service. I had my car serviced here and a technician broke my oil pan by installing the power steering pump that caused noises that made me pay 189 for inspection fee for their own fault. Zero star!
9715 2018-12-29 18:21:34 I use tea tree oil everything (face wipes, cleanser, the oil itself) and my skin LOVES it .
9716 2018-12-29 18:21:30 Dona Ana County receives vital education funding from the oil and natural gas industry! 
9717 2018-12-29 18:21:00 I'm in line for an oil change and the car next to me has a dog in it so hopefully it will keep me company for the next 30 minutes
9718 2018-12-29 18:20:55 Oh well, if the oil company says it didn’t do it, I guess it didn’t do it 
9719 2018-12-29 18:20:53 And a oil change
9720 2018-12-29 18:20:53 Remain and reform, but then we had a referendum. I expect him to vote against May's deal in the new year. Virgin territory don't you think and tasked with arranging a compromise for millions of angry clueless British people. This oil and water side taking, drives me crazy.
9721 2018-12-29 18:20:52 Lavender oil stops the burn going through the skin layers and takes the heat out of it. Old country remedy I swear by
9722 2018-12-29 18:20:34 It’s sad that I have to take one of my nephews with me to get an oil change so that I don’t get fucked over... 
9723 2018-12-29 18:20:32 could maybe use that oil.......
9724 2018-12-29 18:20:25 @LukeGromen So what was left unsaid is that Russia may have a deal with the Saudis to trade oil market share for oil sales in currencies other than US dollar convertible into Gold? Using MBS as a stalking horse against the US dollar.....
9725 2018-12-29 18:20:23 What they forget to mention is that your oil is way thicker when it's cold and doesn't reach your upper cylinder as easy, and you can score your cylinders and ruin your engine if you don't let your car warm up.
9726 2018-12-29 18:20:22 Getting my oil changed. An older lady is going crazy about this infomercial playing in the waiting area.
9727 2018-12-29 18:20:22 Maybe it's the hyper-religious and the highly moral who are endo-c deficient or they-hyper-youknowwhat. Sometimes, I slip my puppy-wuppy some cbd oil. I'm just saying.
9728 2018-12-29 18:20:21 Trump has been a racist for decades. The influence of Bannon has added an ethnocentric and isolationist version of populism. The wall idea may have been inspired by the Western Wall, but its appeal is making Mexico pay - an idea akin to taking the oil out of Iraq.
9729 2018-12-29 18:20:17 えーんパイパンいちろとかそれ絶対サマトキサマが毛剃ってあげてますやん…
9730 2018-12-29 18:20:14 Lunch wrap: shredded cabbage with oil and vinegar, Monterey jack cheese, and black beans boiled with pork sausage, parsley, garlic, and cumin.
9731 2018-12-29 18:20:04 Not be so ignorant! Oil goes to the coast already in BC and US...you’re just not smart enough to know that!
9732 2018-12-29 18:19:45 顎が伸びるは草
9733 2018-12-29 18:19:44 That will soon buy beard oil very soon. I want aggressive beard growth
9734 2018-12-29 18:19:35 Is @edhenry making the generalization that all undocumented immigrants are criminals?   Are all white fathers child killers like the guy who hid his daughters' corpses in a oil tank?  Are all Republicans corrupt like @realDonaldTrump?
9735 2018-12-29 18:19:24 So I'm probably not the most indicated to give this advice, but I would suggest trying Palmer's Cocount Oil Curl Styler. :)
9736 2018-12-29 18:19:19 Gas prices were up this morning without the tax. The Ontario Government is riding the coat tails of world oil prices being low. Wonder who they’ll blame for the predicted hike coming in the next few weeks due to the volatility of the markets.
9737 2018-12-29 18:19:18 Planning on going to a oil kings game next year  never been to one and good prices too!!
9738 2018-12-29 18:19:15 The western oil sector affects all@of Canada and the soonervthe east and BC recognize that fact the better things will be.  Anyone who likes a carbon tax has no idea of deviation  it will cause
9739 2018-12-29 18:19:10 week two without my nail oil and my nails are falling  o f f
9740 2018-12-29 18:19:06 Since the criminal was brown, but supported by oil money, the hypocritical Tr*mp “administration” has no problem, no comment. Let’s hear him invoke the victim’s name, then smear all Saudis as illegals needing  to be blocked from entering (or leaving) our country.  We’ll wait...
9741 2018-12-29 18:18:56 +  I only have oil so it will be an omelet if you don't  mind. [He started cooking on an old stove that was in the kitchen are of  his apartment]
9742 2018-12-29 18:18:56 馬油を英訳すると…うーむ(中の人の英語力の限界)
9743 2018-12-29 18:18:55 Y’all just discovered Avocado and coconut oil?
9744 2018-12-29 18:18:45 We issuance has turned negative i believe.. the correlation between oil and credit is very clear.. biz investment is heavily tied to shale
9745 2018-12-29 18:18:31 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
9746 2018-12-29 18:18:31 Not to pour more oil into the fire, but I really hope this one is supported by an actual license agreement...
9747 2018-12-29 18:18:23 Because it’s true. These protesters and anti pipeline people (a tiny minority) just keep pushing old agendas. 

I love my Chilliwack area and the coast, but I also know pipelines are the safest way for oil products. 

Rachel Notley and her NDP now will use rail...far far worse!
9748 2018-12-29 18:18:16 The world & specifically #Americans need to know- There were at one time some 18 corrupt dictators throughout LatinAmerica all supported by CIA to protect US interests oil, copper, fruits, casinos worth billions.
9749 2018-12-29 18:17:56 Oops. Cpc would axe carbon tax, revive AB oil and gas industry including pipeline, maybe look at unfairness of confederation, defund cbc, no bought media, tighter immigration, work better with allies USA,FordOnt vs enemies UN MacronMerkel
9750 2018-12-29 18:17:46 Large oil moves drive credit a la 2015-2016
9751 2018-12-29 18:17:35 Them oil change shops be getting off
9752 2018-12-29 18:17:34 Do you acknowledge that the western oil sector affects all of Canada??
9753 2018-12-29 18:17:30 Iraday to kuch  aise hi lag rahai hai,
Is ko ye nahi maloom ke agar Oil ki smell  US ko lag gai to bas wo koi  bahana dhoond ke karlay ge Invasion 
(Weapon of Mass Destruction - #IRAQ )
9754 2018-12-29 18:17:28 That and putting coconut oil in your hair= true indian
9755 2018-12-29 18:17:20 So you are okay with selling Cdn oil at a deep discount which hurts everyone? What’s that got to do with the HTF? If AB hadn’t sent 100s of billions to Quebec, AB’d have a much better profit picture but would still be reviled by resentful Canadians in other provinces. #timetogo
9756 2018-12-29 18:17:14 It is amazing how many call it welfare to invest in the education & health of a workforce but not welfare to subsidize farmers, banks, coal, sports stadiums, oil, loans, & bailouts, then use politicians to call one socialism and the other public-private partnerships to get votes.
9757 2018-12-29 18:17:10 Shoaib pls post a picture of the Bhai behen. We miss them very much. Especially their convo's , statue game, pillow fight, tickling game, hair oil massage.
Pls don't forget. 
I remember Dipika tellin Sree 'Bhai 29th you'll make me chai and we both will drink together'
9758 2018-12-29 18:17:02 Organic beard oil
9759 2018-12-29 18:17:01 Mineral oil. Helps to strengthen them as well as keeping them water resistant, but ring cleaning becomes a regular task.
9760 2018-12-29 18:16:59 The world uses 100 plus million barrels of oil a day. That is 3.5 billion gallons a day. Demand is going up right now. Not down. It will take many decades until that changes, if ever. As for your other google results... it’s just a display of your simple mindedness. Maersk .. 
9761 2018-12-29 18:16:55 Of course there may be no connection and the Tapcal Trust Fund PCs simply did the easy route to money selling the oil to US companies that profited from the dumb lazy policy decisions of the PCs. But if there was a connection this would be good reason not to re-employ PCs ever.
9762 2018-12-29 18:16:49 My happy ass is about to walk around Walmart for 4 hours because of a damn oil change
9763 2018-12-29 18:16:39 so pretty  how much vitamin e oil did you put on?
9764 2018-12-29 18:16:39 Almost beat #2 GOP POTUS nominee (Cruz), incumbent, in a mid-term. Did it w/ no PAC $. That oil & gas claim is bs; a lot of individual donations from o&g employees (bunch of o&g in TX, duh). B4, a no-name rep from El Paso, different time zone from rest of TX. Spanish fluent!!
9765 2018-12-29 18:16:36 Bruh Bizzy really had the Carbine repeater from Red Dead....Did he use the gun oil?
9766 2018-12-29 18:16:31 can’t wait to run my man a shower, pour oil on the floor, then beat him w/ a belt 
9767 2018-12-29 18:16:19 Yeah. They had the money for it. Laura Bush is for real Texan tho. Her daddy is west Texas oil.
9768 2018-12-29 18:16:14 @DrAseemMalhotra I've been led to think that rapeseed oil is better than olive oil for cooking at higher temperatures as olive gives off toxins when smoking. Is this correct then?
9769 2018-12-29 18:16:12 Best thing you can do is the minute (and I mean right when and not a few hours later) you feel sick, get a clove of garlic and eat it. Then, take some  Echinacea & goldenseal. You can take, for a few days, some Holy Basil and/or Oil of Oregano. It does usually work.
9770 2018-12-29 18:16:02 Well put! 
Gas prices low = Saint Douglas' doing
Gas prices high = Trudeau's fault
International oil prices = somehow irrelevant, according to conservatives
9771 2018-12-29 18:15:58 Not fcking oil companies idiots.  Oil is dirt cheap.  Its the fcking taxes placed on them. !!!
9772 2018-12-29 18:15:57 If it's not mixed with salt, pepper  garlic and oil and used to covered quartered baked potatoes, it's a garnish... which mom falsely claimed as a cure for garlic breath! Now, back to Mueller!
9773 2018-12-29 18:15:47 Aku cpt kerja alan kat sapura. I know it's contract but that's how oil & gas works. Aku dapat iv pegawai atm diorang paksa aku tp aku tak berapa minat. So now aku sangat serabut kena paksa kena bebel hari hari
9774 2018-12-29 18:15:46 They are biggest oil and gas producers in the world and if they sell to you with lower price then to the rest and thus give you economic advantage is very tempting.
Their history is complicated.
9775 2018-12-29 18:15:33 Well this is one offensive insult to Western Canadians. The fact that Trudeau and his Liberals are trying to take credit for anything good that happened in the West is one blatant "Bald Faced Lie." He and his Cabal have done everything they can to destroy the oil industry here.
9776 2018-12-29 18:15:31 Broooo is it bad?
9777 2018-12-29 18:15:30 Ummm , Cantu tea tree & peppermint oil helped my hair grown like shit 
9778 2018-12-29 18:15:28 I keep smelling lubricant oil (the type you would use for metal tools -- not WD-40) and I can't figure out where it's coming from. And it's driving me insane 
9779 2018-12-29 18:15:28 They have acquired a nostalgic fondness for Bushes, especially the dead ones, so anything could happen.
9780 2018-12-29 18:15:27 Well no because legally you wouldn't have any oil either because the platforms would remain the property of the British government.
9781 2018-12-29 18:15:15 I make it with coconut oil a little bit of honey and coffee grounds  there’s recipes online on Pinterest 
9782 2018-12-29 18:15:09 Well said Doctor Rick. My FB feed is filled with Apple Cider vinegar and coconut oil ads because I have seb derm. I follow Dr. Dray (dermatologist) Vlog on YouTube and have learned less is more with skin care. She is fabulous!
9783 2018-12-29 18:15:06 . Cannabis oil isnt though and it grows like weeds. No subsidies needed.   Farmers should have been lobbying for full cannabis legalization instead of just hemp instead of going after a government aid deal so they would get paid regardless of their sucess as a farmer.
9784 2018-12-29 18:14:56 Mixing the sound of garbage and changing an oil filter, chopped up
9785 2018-12-29 18:14:53 Another frustrating thing about "Venezuela proves socialism is bad" takes: they suggests if Venezuela had spent it's oil money on it's military and it's elite class instead of social programs, everything would be just jake when price of oil fell and blew a hole in their budget.
9786 2018-12-29 18:14:48 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.
9787 2018-12-29 18:14:46 I’ve been natural my entire life. So all y’all can miss me with the BS. Y’all don’t know the struggle of mixing Herbal Essence conditioner, carrot oil, and water together to make a leave in. 
9788 2018-12-29 18:14:43 We should all use SM to example the enslavement of #FakeNews with “Selective facts”. As in “Financial experts say drilling is unneeded due to a glut of world oil supply”. Conveniently omitting it’s cheaper on our wallets to use US oil than Saudi oil. That’s how they lie. #MAGA
9789 2018-12-29 18:14:42 これだよ！
9790 2018-12-29 18:14:38 "The phoniest and nastiest things in the world cannot be cuddled or even pursued - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
9791 2018-12-29 18:14:29 พอแล้วครับแม่หน่า 
9792 2018-12-29 18:14:14 Crab, mango, fettuccine alfredo with artichoke hearts, sour dough bread with roasted fresh garlic & olive oil.
9793 2018-12-29 18:14:11 Dude, I hate to break this to you, but Ontario didn't have a carbon tax on gas/oil, only on natural gas. You may have noticed that GLOBAL OIL PRICES HAVE FALLEN. Keeping money in our pocket as you kill the environment and impoverish our schools, yay you.
9794 2018-12-29 18:14:09 Why??. If it wasnt for them you wouldnt have a migration problem!. 
Oil and Money.
Honduras for one.
9795 2018-12-29 18:13:58 Look for anointing  oil and wash my eye first.
9796 2018-12-29 18:13:55 « Sustainable » palm oil.  Yes or no?  I wasn’t sure so I didn’t buy it.
9797 2018-12-29 18:13:47 We do know that the private prison industry has a gargantuan benefit from all the business churned up by his administration. Corporate environmental destroyers, oil, gas & not just the tax cuts.
9798 2018-12-29 18:13:21 Which part of the above “isn’t about economics”? We’d be Greece with a better national drink. SNP models from 2014 based on oil at $110+ while it is now circa $50! Independence = Austerity ++. #justsaynaw #keepbritainbritain
9799 2018-12-29 18:13:09 try tea tree oil but dilute it first , it works great . I used it on my nose piercing and the bump is gone 
9800 2018-12-29 18:13:05 For the love of dog, stop the lies. There was no carbon tax. The price of oil has dropped - that is why gas prices are so low.
9801 2018-12-29 18:13:03 Your COA in 2/2 is exactly correct. We could absorb the loss of 5 CVN & 30% of our major surface combatants in 9-months a lot more than China could take having every seaport a collection of smoking piers and sloshing oil slicks. Yes, we'd quickly be WINCHESTER in everything fm/1
9802 2018-12-29 18:13:01 I was going w my dad to pick up my car from my oil change who’s name is black Betty after the song and black Betty comes on the radio
9803 2018-12-29 18:12:54 Buhari should not have tweeted the Shagari tweet. 
Don’t rub yourself with palm oil where people are doing bon-fire.
9804 2018-12-29 18:12:51 Interesting that you defend the pollution of the ocean from your city sewage but are unable to see all the new tech and regulations that the oil and gas industry has and is working on.
So, it's ok for Victoria to kill of the ocean because a sewer plant in on the way, but eff O/G?
9805 2018-12-29 18:12:46 I need a good facial oil
9806 2018-12-29 18:12:43 I finally went in for an oil change. Expensive for no reason. 
9807 2018-12-29 18:12:31 I don't think pope should be 9n 6th, what power he has, just Vatican?? Angela Merkel should below than 7-8, Modi should be at least in top 4 because he have 3rd biggest military and 1.3 billion people, and mohammad salem should be above 6 because he have oil to rule the world
9808 2018-12-29 18:12:27 For me it's not even that. When you decide to write a piece on a certain subject, that becomes the primary focus of the article. In this case it's Russell. It's fairly straightforward & yet so many want to ignore it. I don't get it.
9809 2018-12-29 18:12:27 I'm a chemical engineer, now retired, who spent many years working in the oil industry - including Alberta. Oil prices have always gone up and down. Clearly you weren't around in 1986. I don't like Trudeau either but it's hard to blame him for world oil prices.
9810 2018-12-29 18:12:16 Henry Cavil was a hopeful and compassionate Superman, he saved the kids on the bus, he tried helping that waitress in the diner, he saved the men on the oil rig, and he saved Lois before he even knew who she was.
9811 2018-12-29 18:12:11 It’s not basil, but it is pesto. Pesto just means “paste” & doesn’t have to be basil. Try it. Raw spinach, walnuts, olive oil, Parmesan in a blender/small  food processor. Alternative, chsnge from  routine & affordable.
9812 2018-12-29 18:12:08 So apparently the bookies have Bishop Emerytus on 5/2 to leave Arsenal...

At halftime for a quick trip to Darfur for more oil for that head #EmeryIn
9813 2018-12-29 18:12:08 Is the best way to release an animal from a glue trap is to use a vegetable oil? Please let me know.
Thank you.
9814 2018-12-29 18:12:04 Fries are basically tasty oil sponges woah
9815 2018-12-29 18:12:00 Not even oil of ulay 
9816 2018-12-29 18:11:52 ゆうきさんがいつかさまいち描いてくれると信じて疑っていない人間がここにいます
9817 2018-12-29 18:11:47 Need a oil change 
9818 2018-12-29 18:11:43 Natural antibiotic - oil of oregano, honey, acv, garlic, cayenne- mix together. Use for preventative and also if you get sick. Shortens the duration. And don't forget to pray for protection. 
9819 2018-12-29 18:11:42 Trophy Beer should be immortalized along side Garri as part of our Natural Resources like Crude Oil.
9820 2018-12-29 18:11:40 Scheduling oil changes and shit while I’m on vacation. #adulting
9821 2018-12-29 18:11:23 I don’t eat their fries. That peanut oil creates a toxic environment first in my stomach and then my entire apartment.
9822 2018-12-29 18:11:19 I choose a candidate that boosts renewables and does not boost oil/gas, because I understand the gravity and far-reaching consequences of my choice.
9823 2018-12-29 18:11:15 Why is it taking so long for a oil change 
9824 2018-12-29 18:11:14 c'est même à ça qu'on les reconnait. allez, bonjour chez vous.
9825 2018-12-29 18:11:03 I agree with much of this, though I enjoyed Edgerton's book more than you did. 
I'd add two other factors to your financialisation as causes of deindustrialisation - North Sea oil, which I believe drove deindustrialisation directly through too high exchange rate...
9826 2018-12-29 18:10:59 Advil and CBD oil are the only things getting me through this week 
9827 2018-12-29 18:10:52 De q hablan. Nos tratan de tarados o que. 
SEÑORES..ANCAP VENDE NAFTA Y GAS OIL
LA NAFTA ES PETRÓLEO REFINADO
EL.PETROLEO BAJA Y BAJA MAS QUE LA INFLACION
LA NAFTA SUBE. Y SU MATERIA PRIMA BAJA.
ENTONCES NO JODAN MAS CON LA BAJA EN TERMINOS REALES
NO SEAN HIPÓCRITAS
9828 2018-12-29 18:10:49 im in between like 5 lifestyles at the contours of olive oil and oregano
9829 2018-12-29 18:10:46 No, it is just that oil and gas are big enough in Texas that even some Democrats work for them. I am sure some GE employees voted for Sanders also. GE( at least used to) manufacture the airborne gattling gun ( used to strafe civilians) in Burlington. Is that held against Sanders?
9830 2018-12-29 18:10:40 Good manners, civility were marks of an urban mind, the oil which keeps normal interactions civil and pleasant. It’s changed across board, rudeness, aggression.. active or passive is celebrated, respected and taken as honest salt of earth thing
9831 2018-12-29 18:10:33 as a farmer ofc i constantly deal with backlash but it just boggles me the lack of respect for other human beings over animals and that's what i can't get over.  how ass headed you gotta be to ignore palm oil and slave labour because bunnies are cuter than brown ppl
9832 2018-12-29 18:10:31 かけるようになりたい！！うわーん
9833 2018-12-29 18:10:27 Waiting for an oil change and the TV is set on Fox News. It is appalling.
9834 2018-12-29 18:10:25 My skin is breaking out on my sideburns rn  my skin is not perfect! But lately I’ve been using geranium oil all over my face and neck, this Clinique gel moisturizer and this face mask hold on I’ll send u pics
9835 2018-12-29 18:10:20 男性向けエロ漫画みたいな描写が性癖だからさ、いつか推しカプでそういう漫画をかきたいのよ かけないんですけと
9836 2018-12-29 18:10:19 え…エルザとは…別に…な…(ﾀﾞｯ
9837 2018-12-29 18:10:17 Bit of a disconnect here, issues that affect people are unaffected by the mass movement of people ?
9838 2018-12-29 18:10:16 Well, if the Iraqi government does not want the U.S. troops there anymore, their citizens better get armed and shoot the bad booboos if they make a resurgence in the area.Good to hear Iraqi Christians may worship there freely now. Law passed recently states so. And share the oil.
9839 2018-12-29 18:10:10 ok who can get me an oil cartridge for a pen lmk
9840 2018-12-29 18:10:03 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
9841 2018-12-29 18:09:56 Now why didn’t people (namely Nancy #Wexler) realize this when it came to the neurodegenerative cluster at #LakeMaracaibo? Anybody? Because Shell Oil was funding her research, or...?
9842 2018-12-29 18:09:52 Share the ESIA report link @PeterPlokoel @FoLTurkana @Ikal_Angelei
9843 2018-12-29 18:09:38 Getting my oil change and I hear the sound of Pokemon Go.. where are you hiding @ReDTeaRx

9844 2018-12-29 18:09:18 I look in the mirror when I rub baby oil on myself
9845 2018-12-29 18:09:14 #Mane scored now come on Arsenal although I don't think you can do anything. Dick Emery gonna give you a half time talk I see more goals a coming from Mo Salah - Oil bottled this game. Kick him off the team.
9846 2018-12-29 18:09:13 Watermelon seed oil for your skin, it seems. Who does this research? I'd like to be on the panel that decides what to investigate next for good skin.
9847 2018-12-29 18:09:12 見に行こうかなって思ったw
9848 2018-12-29 18:09:12 What do some drivers have against car dashboard indicators? They don't seem to notice fuel, oil and temperature indicators until the car stops. Those tiny lights on your dashboard are not there to make your car look fancy. Take note.
9849 2018-12-29 18:09:09 Really hard to say but if he wins the league with Liverpool after 28yrs when up against the oil money, after beating Bayern over in Germany that’s some achievement. Any updates on potential Glazer sale Phil?
9850 2018-12-29 18:09:06 My engine will unplug any carbon tax.  No need for oil.  NH3 via solar.  Can use any fuel if needed, including electricity if set up that way.  Read tweets.  Future of energy is going to be very very cheap.  No carbon tax will work or help.
9851 2018-12-29 18:09:05 Now now Gavin that's not very nice is it ! I mean you know you;re going to confuse the Snake Oil Salesman & totally screw up his plans to con the US public. @POTUS doesn't do reality. He just does illusion. Time for USA to wake up & realise they got conned by @realDonaldTrump !
9852 2018-12-29 18:09:04 in other words, market makers are pricing a plus minus 25% move for $SPX in 2019.. also, 38 % move for oil...
9853 2018-12-29 18:09:02 My dad was wondering why he felt so sleepy all day, turns out he put the Restful Sleep essential oil blend in the diffuser instead of the Uplifting one. lol whadda goof
9854 2018-12-29 18:09:01 I only know basic economics but am comfortable with statistics so Let me pour water OR oil to the fire (whichever pleases Gichuki) by adding an intervening variable - THEFT aka CORRUPTION and misuse of public funds.
9855 2018-12-29 18:08:59 Finally finished Shadow of the Tomb Raider's story. Apart from the stupid oil puzzle, this game was pretty good. XD
9856 2018-12-29 18:08:58 When there’s 3 hot men working on your car just for your simple oil change!  now that’s service @jiffylube
9857 2018-12-29 18:08:54 He’s needs to wonder why Westminster won’t give oil revenue to Hollyrood if it’s worth so little in revenue and taxes.
9858 2018-12-29 18:08:47 Olive Oil products > everything else 
9859 2018-12-29 18:08:28 I’ll pass on the snake oil thanks....
9860 2018-12-29 18:08:24 Well wtf has all the money been going all these years? Why is oil pulled from Scotland recorded as location unknown? Why are they so desperate to hold on to us? Spent millions doing so.

9867 2018-12-29 18:07:48 Oil money now controls damned near every bad thing in politics one can think of - and that’s worldwide. EX: the money Putin funneled to the GOP via the NRA. Putin wouldn’t be a player w/o oil money. GOP wouldn’t be anti climate if not for oil money, etc., etc.
9868 2018-12-29 18:07:46 You guys don't find it strange that someones goal in life is to rub down people with oil. Massage therapist will always be creeps to me.
9869 2018-12-29 18:07:41 The total raised from employees in oil/gas was 1/2 of 1% of his total fundraising (source: journalist Jonathan Allen). That’s minuscule compared to other fields. And NO PAC money was accepted. Only individual giving. Beto stopped taking PAC money in 2014, according to TX Tribune.
9870 2018-12-29 18:07:41 ive never heard of putting oil in the pasta water
9871 2018-12-29 18:07:35 Eat 'em in actual moderation instead of as a daily (or near-daily) part of your diet? Like the rest of the world?

That's like asking, "what do we do with the oil?" re: clean energy development. It'll get used, I promise.

9877 2018-12-29 18:07:16 Why would we want any favours? Legally we can leave and let you keep all the debt, and w/o oil to bolster your tax take you'll find loans much more expensive
9878 2018-12-29 18:07:13 Thank you! It’s getting your hair blown out and then flat ironed and then they put some oil on it and wrap it with plastic wrap and sit you under the dryer for just like 5 minutes and it comes out silky!

9881 2018-12-29 18:06:39 Anti scratch liquid or brake oil will clear that scratch. If it is very deep, then you are at the mercy of panel beaters.
9882 2018-12-29 18:06:19 Wash with shampoo & conditioner... Dry (no hair drying) I made my own mixture of oils...

100% virgin olive oil, castor oil, tea tree oil 3 drops & coconut oil...

9885 2018-12-29 18:05:45 Most soybeans are processed for their oil and protein for the animal feed industry. A smaller percentage is processed for human consumption and made into products including soy milk, soy flour, soy protein, tofu and many retail food products. Soybeans are also used in non-food.

9907 2018-12-29 18:04:03 The fact is that Libya is big, pretty empty and has oil, so under present circumstances the temptation for people to try to grab a bit and set up a mini state is always strong.

It's like he didn't come with oil. 
9915 2018-12-29 18:02:43 But eating oils rich in polyunsaturated fats, such as soybean, canola (rapeseed), corn, safflower and sunflower oils...is a wrong advice too.

Those oils are NOT healthier than  Olive Oil or Avocado Oil.

9924 2018-12-29 18:02:14 To be horribly truthful, it was about Germany colonizing Wypipo (“Why not? Everybody colonized POC”) and oil and trade routes. Many of our folks LIKED Hitler’s goals. As for the Jews, we’d never cared until Hitler got most of them. We only paid attention when we were forced to.
9925 2018-12-29 18:02:03 I heard an Indy voter tell me that Westminster fixed the price of oil just to influence the referendum. When I showed him the stupidity of his claim, as in OPEC, he just laughed in my face.

9968 2018-12-29 17:57:49 CEO's and Execs just "have jobs" at oil companies. Nothing to see move along.

This hot take is easily refuted by asking why Beto signed a pledge differentiating between rich execs and actual people who just have jobs.

9973 2018-12-29 17:57:05 As you know, we went through all that up here. Doom and gloom.... The arse is going to fall out of the economy. In a few years there won't be enough oil to fill a chip pan.. Etc... Etc... All utter crap!
Never let the truth get in the way of a good story 
9974 2018-12-29 17:57:04 Not a false binary if there is no current or short term “green” replacement for oil demand. Needs to be imported from elsewhere if we aren’t supplying. Keep your simplistic aspirational comments coming.

9976 2018-12-29 17:56:56 LOL! That’s not what the system was designed to do. It doesn’t change the oil in your car either.
But it is an example of a system that can b instituted when something becomes a priority.
We need to collect the data on gun use to have an informed debated. That’s all.
9977 2018-12-29 17:56:53 I was, and I'd say that the clothes worn (wide lapels, waaay too big collars, and a plaid bow tie for 1st grade pictures) were ridiculous. Oh, and that the oil embargo gave a very  small/limited preview of what will happen when we're out of oil.

Our country that has the 2nd largest oil reserve on the planet & we rely on others to process it & sell it back to us.  
It’s time to refine more of our own oil and look inward for a generation or two and rebuild Canada to what it once was !!

9991 2018-12-29 17:55:21 Bashagha? What does this have to do with LNA?  Tripoli cannot defend itself so how do they claim the right to steer any process for the Fezzan?  And this fake declared Central is no more than a sham to grab the oil crescent for themselves/Misrata
9992 2018-12-29 17:55:12 すみりんほんとありがとね
9993 2018-12-29 17:55:07 Republicans think we should feel guilty for being educated or caring about others or wanting healthcare or affordable education. You know, being a decent human being. We will ask for a republican opinion when we are worried about oil or guns or what people do in their bedrooms.
9994 2018-12-29 17:55:02 A lot of peeps screaming about oil projects which are barely viable/breakeven at today's poo even in a success case... some r in at placing with warrants attached - not for me.
9995 2018-12-29 17:54:58 Oil fields in backyard and 3.79 here in Bakersfield.
9996 2018-12-29 17:54:58 this is interesting because I’ve heard people say you add olive oil to make sure the pasta doesn’t stick to each other(?)
9997 2018-12-29 17:54:48 It's oil
9998 2018-12-29 17:54:44 Served with choice of side.

9999 2018-12-29 17:54:30 But where the morass of slimy little seeds, and the THICK COOKING OIL?
10000 2018-12-29 17:54:24 Stop reading newspaper and I would never know falling rupee, tussles in RBI, oil prices, ISIS..... What kind of idea is that?? Ostrich mentality
10001 2018-12-29 17:54:16 Baby oil hehe bukan oily:(
10002 2018-12-29 17:54:12 I challenge y’all to leave essential oils in 2018, or at least proselytizing about essential oils. You sound like fucking snake oil salesmen. Worse than potheads talking about how weed can cure cancer.
10003 2018-12-29 17:54:08 The person to chair the climate crisis committee directly profits from oil and gas but definitely the left are the bad guys for pointing it out.

10005 2018-12-29 17:54:05 castor oil so nasty omg imma throw it right back up
10006 2018-12-29 17:54:02 Oil fields in backyard and I paid 3.79. Thanks Californina!
10007 2018-12-29 17:53:47 Gosh that’s not good. You need sleep to help your body heal. Effervescent Vit C tablets are good to help with the immune system. Olbas oil at the side of the bed.
10008 2018-12-29 17:53:47 Anti-aging hand treatment - soak your hands in milk for 15 mins. Rinse then apply a bit of olive oil on them.
10009 2018-12-29 17:53:47 Lmao I actually do need a oil change
10010 2018-12-29 17:53:41 Agree 100000%. It should have been done years ago but religion is like oil industry, they resists.
10011 2018-12-29 17:53:37 This has happened to me more times than I’d like to admit. Washing hands doesn’t work u have to use like rubbing alcohol, or hard alcohol, or like grease strength dish washing soap, and/or an oil. It’s fucking bananas how long that shit stays on ur hands
10012 2018-12-29 17:53:36 Jose your enthusiasm and joy of cooking is infectious. I like you love good Spanish olive oil. My favourite Spanish dish is Gazpacho. Would love to see your version. Contains soaked bread or doesn't
10013 2018-12-29 17:53:29 When it’s 18 degrees outside, I can’t help but be grateful that I’m lazy and pay someone else to change my oil.
10014 2018-12-29 17:53:25 Soft scrambled eggs with chinese chile oil on them. It has all these crispy fried shallots and garlic and is my favorite condiment

10018 2018-12-29 17:53:07 I think you just need a dose of me  until then tho CBD oil is the way to go. I hear and read lots of good things about it. Been thinking of getting myself some.
10019 2018-12-29 17:53:01 Oil myself up. 
10020 2018-12-29 17:52:56 I been here since 9:30 getting my damn oil changed 
10021 2018-12-29 17:52:36 I stopped reading him years ago when his science denialism and cheerleading for Big Oil became too annoying. Life is better without reading him.
10022 2018-12-29 17:52:32 I just heard there was a glut of oil products and gas prices are down. That is just a natural market signal to reduce production. There is also something on the horizon I am not sure what it is but it looks like an 94% efficient autonomous electric vehicle! Better make some plans
10023 2018-12-29 17:52:29 my baby got my oil changed and put new tires on my car  thanks baby  @Kayla_davis25
