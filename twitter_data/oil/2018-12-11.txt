1 2018-12-11 23:59:51 I think my plantain is ready for that oil 
2 2018-12-11 23:59:51 I see you retweeted the Iceland ad about Palm Oil. That as wasn’t banned by the EU it was banned by British organisation.
3 2018-12-11 23:59:49 Absolutely. Landfills are overflowing and recycling seems to be failing. No one wants to address this problem. The hydrogen fuel cell will slow the flow of oil. What can slow the flow of trash? Think about it - advertisement packaging is a "gross polluter".

9 2018-12-11 23:58:38 Did a better job than Gallogly and is more well liked than what someone called an "oil overlord" and he asked for a donation back because Gallogly would not install a plaque to honor Boren's late BIL who was treated at the OU Cancer center.

11 2018-12-11 23:58:27 Gotta stop allowing people to transfer their bad energy to me.... gonna research how to block that ish, there has to be a crystal or oil— something for that cause I’m not bringing this into 2019! I refuse!
12 2018-12-11 23:58:23 i still recommend Jojoba for you...if you want to add a secondary oil you can - black caster oil is great, but it will be heavy so only a TINY bit, olive oil is heavy, coconut oil is okay BUT can cause breakouts, argon oil is the best but $$$$
13 2018-12-11 23:58:11 if cryptos to succeed were fiat fails it needs store value gold.silver,oil,gas even fiat its usecase was transfer any amount fiat worldwide go retrieve your fiat or what you decide if u cant turn it back at will its worse than a bank at least  the bank gives you plastic to spend
14 2018-12-11 23:58:08 And if Alberta hadn't been so stupid we would be in the same position as Norway when it comes to oil and gas. Give it some thought if you can.
15 2018-12-11 23:57:52 Ok, you've got a point with the sunflower oil...but well, I prefer to not even have it at home (sometimes I also use butter for cooking).

Regarding dark chocolate, you're right, let's keep it out of your life. 
16 2018-12-11 23:57:45 Just like Trump likes to talk spending t axs payers dollars for for his wall his friends wants to steal ... Halliburton does that ring a bell when they stole millions of dollars for oil during the bush years Dick Cheney, so we should bring up what we want Medicare  for all
17 2018-12-11 23:57:32 Butttttt def gotta get this oil changed before stark. Or I’m pretty sure my car will explode. Lol
18 2018-12-11 23:57:32 oh ... he administers it through the back passage? tell him you'll take the oil orally.

39 2018-12-11 23:57:02 Lt demand for oil still grows and ALTA is more diversified than ever
40 2018-12-11 23:56:59 How about getting natural gas to Vermomt to really help the people imstead of lettimg Canadian owned Irving ripping us of for fuel oil and Propane.
41 2018-12-11 23:56:55 it now which can be a sustainable solution. Am of course not saying we shouldn’t do anything about it. Look, the West built its empires using coal and oil. And when it’s finally Africa’s turn to eradicate poverty and hunger, they tell us that we shouldn’t do it and instead (3)
42 2018-12-11 23:56:40 Car wash .. new tires .. oil change 
43 2018-12-11 23:56:33 can I borrow a 1/3 cup of vegetable oil @ any/everyone ?

will pay you in funfetti cake
44 2018-12-11 23:56:31 Hate taking my car to Toyota bc they always trying to pull a fast one on me for more money but apparently no regular oil change places know how to take off the Toyota cap.
45 2018-12-11 23:56:28 all I need is my Juul and oil pen. thank you.
46 2018-12-11 23:56:25 Oil painting is cool except for literally everything about it
47 2018-12-11 23:56:23 Oh boy John. Lots to unpack there. It’s almost like that oil dependence thing didn’t happen overnight? If he was the man with a plan, why isn’t Mexico paying for the wall?
48 2018-12-11 23:56:22 But David haven’t you seen those fossil fuel industry funded twitter ads? Apparently Rockefeller has helped fund some of the lawsuits, which means the oil companies are just being unfairly targeted by moneyed interests or something
49 2018-12-11 23:56:05 Soooooo there’s no oil in my car and I’m stuck at omni
50 2018-12-11 23:56:04 食べつわりかね？なんにし、誕生日おめでとう！
51 2018-12-11 23:56:03 So I am curious. Where were the Tapcal Trust Fund PCs all during the 44 years y'all were in power? So why did you sell oil cheap? Why didn't you build refineries? Why did you get donations for the Tapcal Trust Fund? Who donated? Maybe playing hardball hasn't worked for y'all?
52 2018-12-11 23:55:56 Ada juga yg bilang pke tamanu oil

54 2018-12-11 23:55:47 I don’t support Quebec in this. We should be using Alberta oil over Saudi.... Unfortunately the media won’t spin it that way.
55 2018-12-11 23:55:21 jojoba oil all ova my body
56 2018-12-11 23:55:08 Yes man with all the controversy that surrounds him for so many years
NETSERV, EWI Energy Saga, Cuban Lightbulb Saga, Bad Gas Saga and 3 years of mismanagement and missing oil at Petrojam under his tenure...yet you  want the Govt to sack Wheatley...Peta u r a damn HYPOCRITE
57 2018-12-11 23:55:00 Trump struck oil 
'Term-oil
58 2018-12-11 23:54:56 Is it a coincidence that Quebec will receive $1.4 billion more in Canada welfare payment (equalization) for a total of $13 Billions from Trudeau and him being opposed to pipelines just like Trudeau. Don’t like Alberta oil but sure likes the money from Alberta.
59 2018-12-11 23:54:46 And Telus. Oh wait, we all need to start boycotting Suncor and most other oil companies cuz they support that damn carbon tax. Better get on that right way. Don’t buy Gas from anybody... that’ll show em! 
60 2018-12-11 23:54:44 Then I highly suggest use hip oil on top of those!
61 2018-12-11 23:54:25 About 5 minutes until pre-game show starts on @98COOLfm before @BladesHockey (19-10-3) hosts @EdmOilKings (16-11-5) at @SaskTelCtr.
Guests are ...

...plus more @TPS_Guy speaking with Sam Cosentino of @Sportsnet
62 2018-12-11 23:54:19 Every month what kills us is good for us. Coconut oil, carbs, protein, dark chocolate, and coffee, then opposite. It is that confusing.
63 2018-12-11 23:54:16 You mean calf sleeves? Those are great if you get leg cramps. I use them for longer runs.
64 2018-12-11 23:54:14 We need a pipeline from Alberta to Ontario to refine some oil and then ship by tanker and rail from there to New Brunswick.
65 2018-12-11 23:54:13 Dollar is almost 10% stronger yoy in Q1. Oil down huge. Revenue growth might be non-existent. Refi for corps getting bigger and at higher rates.
66 2018-12-11 23:54:07 post under this has some good points. The palm oil dilemma is that people are just replacing palm oil farms with butter/dairy farms, so it is speciesism, because then you’re just prioritizing saving rainforest animals. As usual, it’s a deeper problem, but I know u know that
67 2018-12-11 23:53:55 Lemon oil girl! Its a lifesaver!
68 2018-12-11 23:53:45 Basically a female condom, but whatever the captions says.
69 2018-12-11 23:53:37 Just tried beard oil and that shit does in fact works
70 2018-12-11 23:53:28 Tbs tea tree yg mana? Fw toner oil??
71 2018-12-11 23:53:20 Let's try a healthy alternative to olive oil! Coconut oil!
.
.
Umm...that shits expensive
72 2018-12-11 23:53:12 White gravy has all the the flavor of flour boiled in milk with some vegetable oil thrown in. Tastes like it to because that's basically what it is unless and until you add sausage, lard or other animal by-product into the mix. Plus a bucket of salt.
73 2018-12-11 23:53:08 Which apparently costs scotland about £30billion a year excluding our oil. We get almost no defence not even a millions worth. we as good as pay for the wmd we hold which means nothing if we are attacked on the mainland and our EU membership % is not about £20billion it's theft.

75 2018-12-11 23:53:00 Auston Robertson tried to find Lucas Oil- but the cops found him in Ft Wayne
76 2018-12-11 23:52:58 @Carlosflores442 rare video of you putting oil in your car
77 2018-12-11 23:52:43 Great products will do.. Eg: I am thinking of purchasing a model S but i have to own a Bentley and a Velar first.. I don't think electric or oil I just buy what i'd love to own.. now the new roadster changed my mind not because it is electric but because it's a great car..
78 2018-12-11 23:52:32 Johnsons baby oil with aloe vera and vitamin e  125ml HAHA
79 2018-12-11 23:52:31 Roger Stone could probably out slick an oil can. Look at his history. With all due respect I see no difference this time... but I may be wrong.
80 2018-12-11 23:52:31 I have cocoa butter & bio oil now!
81 2018-12-11 23:52:29 Ya, dumbass, oil can be readily made by ecological means. We don't need idiots like you with redundant opinions.  Not following you is a blessing !!!
82 2018-12-11 23:52:22 Essential oil jewelry is stupid and I’m sorry if you disagree but I have to insist that I’m right.
83 2018-12-11 23:52:20 Good for them,if you hate oil,don’t use oil,simple solution
84 2018-12-11 23:52:14 I mean with that much oil on it's hard not to 
85 2018-12-11 23:52:11 .....small group who own ALL the LAND which we NEED to survive vs try to control many small farmers?? DANGEROUS! Suppose foreign powers buy up all this land, have control over water, food sources, coal, oil, gas...anything under the land!
86 2018-12-11 23:52:05 Lmao ur guess is as good as mine!
Maybe an oil based remover or wipe 
87 2018-12-11 23:51:55 Still can’t find Lucas Oil or the Rose Bowl
88 2018-12-11 23:51:41 I got an oil change & my baby feels so much better smh
89 2018-12-11 23:51:23 Black seed oil is a miracle worker!
90 2018-12-11 23:51:15 Can't believed Saudi gave  good price on oil barely bulk DoD  steels fees
91 2018-12-11 23:51:13 My face, hands and lips are so dry no matter how much lotion and chapstick I use.  Time to go heavy on water and coconut oil
92 2018-12-11 23:50:53 That moment when you impress your bf because you know how to check your oil in your car. I know how to do things, I just make him do the things lol
93 2018-12-11 23:50:52 He wants to sell Oil to china and increase prices to Canadians, instead of building a pipeline to Ontario.
94 2018-12-11 23:50:48 i love oil paint but damn u need so much time n patience for it
95 2018-12-11 23:50:39 That was a brutal pro tip.
96 2018-12-11 23:50:39 To clarify- not misleading or deceptive @theberglenator's part. He seems to be honestly posting something. Whomever published the stats I'd being musleading.

By that I mean, we would typically assume that "oil & gas" means industry, not individual employees.
97 2018-12-11 23:50:35 He smiled, thin and slight, when he saw Meng Yao move to match his rhythm, and he gave a few more thrusts with his hand before he dragged his fingers out, leaving the hole glistening with oil.
98 2018-12-11 23:50:29 Use a little olive oil
99 2018-12-11 23:50:20 Wait... snake oil isnt real? LOL
100 2018-12-11 23:49:42 Lemon essential oil is excellent for study and clarity. Place 4  in a diffuser  purifies the air. Lemon is essential in an aromatherapy first aid kit. 

Natural hand sanitizer. Aloe vera  gel add to a small pot of aloe vera. 4  lemon, 5  tea tree or mānuka, 3  rosemary
101 2018-12-11 23:49:39 Since when was oil brown and sloppy and stinky LIKE SHIT?
102 2018-12-11 23:49:34 Plus, isn't Petrojam the dominant player? What % of players import their own oil? Would Petrojam be broken into several companies as part of privatisation? I'd think state vs private ownership is a different issue from whether markets are monopoly/oligopoly or "free"

105 2018-12-11 23:49:12 Do your Home work.. 
Kuwait was Directional drilling into Iraq and stealing their oil.
S. Hussein Talk to The USA about stopping it. Bush gave Them the permission needed . This is the double Cross by bush as was the wmd afterwards .
Research it..
106 2018-12-11 23:49:01 Manchin is a pro-coal Democrat, who received $156,240 in campaign contributions from the oil & gas industries in 2018. He still earns money from a coal brokerage company he ran before his life in politics.  He should NOT be head of Energy and Natural Resource C. @HouseDemocrats
107 2018-12-11 23:48:58 I thought they used to put oil on the poles 
108 2018-12-11 23:48:55 Are you at work? Do you have any kind of cooking oil?
109 2018-12-11 23:48:43 She just needs a 'cuddly' guy to keep her warm in the middle of a long, cold, lonely night...

Or maybe she needs her oil tank filled.
110 2018-12-11 23:48:26 Okayyy Van Horn. You can’t really be booked for OIL CHANGES through January 
111 2018-12-11 23:48:22 Did you finally get to drive it long enough to need the oil changed?
112 2018-12-11 23:48:19 Just thinking about putting oil on my face makes my pores feel clogged ofn
113 2018-12-11 23:48:14 and remember you aren't supposed to be dripping in oil. but do warm it up.
114 2018-12-11 23:48:12 I need a new leave in conditioner and hair oil, any suggestions? Just for some info my hair is colored and dry as HELL . I’m also low porosity.
115 2018-12-11 23:48:02 I'm not limiting it to the use in transportation but it would burn cleaner when used in production lines to produce hemp products. There are more ways to get energy than oil and gas. We are at an era where we can create just as much power without using oil or gas.
116 2018-12-11 23:47:57 There is still an extremely bullish outcome not readily apparent. PADD3 inventories once they're gone will limit US export capacity. While PADD2 cannot get its stocks out, may even keep building. This will leave the water short oil. Speed of draws + Jan exports are key.
117 2018-12-11 23:47:54 It means, as we’ve seen in France - transition cannot be on the backs of the average worker. The primary culprit is the oil elites who were apprised of the ensuing #climatechaos decades ago per their own scientific due diligence, yet chose to deceive us, out of greed #polluterpay
118 2018-12-11 23:47:54 Tea tree oil literally does wonders on a dry scalp! It definitely helps with itching too 
119 2018-12-11 23:47:46 Never mind, the oil,  and British Army personnel, too kill Yemeni children is worth it.
UK also encouraged, the spread of this extreme Islamic doctrine.
120 2018-12-11 23:47:42 I did read it- 30 donors from the oil and gas industry gave the max $2700- it adds up.
121 2018-12-11 23:47:27 It's not a double standard to treat smart people like smart people, dumb people like dumb people, and evil people like evil people. 

I wasn't aware that being 28 somehow distinguished you as a type of person.
122 2018-12-11 23:47:14 For very smaller issues, this may be results.
Sir,  please ensure,
i) GST rates are reduced,
ii) Oil rates are reduced &
III) Attack on  common men irrespective of the reasons by mobs in various states be stopped with immediate effect.
123 2018-12-11 23:47:11 To heal a pimple quickly, apply tea tree oil on pimple every few hours, and apply vitamin E oil on the spot, about 1 hour before bedtime.
124 2018-12-11 23:47:07 My sister paid me in chick fil a breakfast to change her oil so for all the friends who’s vehicles I’ve done work on, y’all owe me two chick fil a sandwiches per hour

128 2018-12-11 23:46:55 了解です。
頑張りましょう
129 2018-12-11 23:46:54 Its a truck stop/ gas station company. They used to be two seperate companies. And I believe pilot was owned by Marathon oil previously (Marathon Pilot)
130 2018-12-11 23:46:46 Should the provincial government have limited oil production in Alberta?
131 2018-12-11 23:46:34 Sad part is Englands has never ever put one penny into Scotland but we have had to finance ourselves and then once we hit oil it was stolen in the 70s and then we put far more in than we ever got back. And are still expected to give more for defence and the EU membership/
132 2018-12-11 23:46:30 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
133 2018-12-11 23:46:27 Just back from Norway & unless we get rid of about 90% of the population, find a load of gas & oil then the people who are left decide to make a model based on social justice, that aren't going to happen
134 2018-12-11 23:46:25 DRILLING  MORE  OIL  IS  NOT  ENERGY  INDEPENDENCE  #energytransition
135 2018-12-11 23:46:23 #bcpoli @cknw @bc1 @steeletalk  hhhmmm Climate Change & Science Deniers -- the question is -- Why do so many Science Deniers listen to the GLOBAL\CORUS network - what reasons would they have for doing it = Perhaps GLOBAL & CORUS make money off LIE-PINION=Just like big oil

138 2018-12-11 23:46:05 The fact is we don't need oil. We may think we do but we don't. I would much rather have a clean breathable environment and ride horses than to continue on the way we are going. I tell you what I will write up my thesis on this and tag you in it. I'll prove that hemp is a must.
139 2018-12-11 23:46:02 You call. Your Number 1 issue when you vote. Great!
But... do you: 
Avoid plastics.
Walk/bike/use EV
Avoid red meat.
Buy organic
Not over indulge
Avoid gold/diamonds/palm oil
Talk to others?
Those are the tough ones. Those actions are the ones that will make the difference.
140 2018-12-11 23:45:43 Ask the “ natives “ that work on the oil sands what they think . There’s actually quite a few .
141 2018-12-11 23:45:42 I say bring it to a ‘nullify’ rate, increase the non-crude-oil consumption by focusing on Renewable Energy Sources
142 2018-12-11 23:45:21 No one over 70.
Also, dude isnt blue collar, and his kid is in DEEP with big oil.
143 2018-12-11 23:45:21 i use the tea tree oil from the body shop and it’s worked really well for me
144 2018-12-11 23:45:18 #TonightVMT most of the ‘bonus’ money will go towards oil, coal, ESB, Gas and paying the ‘weekly man’
145 2018-12-11 23:45:12 Can’t believe my first day on the oil rig is tomorrow  exited/nervous
146 2018-12-11 23:45:11 Wrong. The US has always brought oil on the open market.  US oil has always cost more
147 2018-12-11 23:45:05 I lived in the middle east in the 1950s-1960s. We had to have every vaccine there was to protect us. We had to get f'n CHOLERA shots. The Oil co had to open their own hospital, for g-d's sake.

This woman has lived in a protected place and has no idea how bad it is out there.
148 2018-12-11 23:45:04 No more Saudi oil to the US
149 2018-12-11 23:45:03 We can drink clean oil now, right?
150 2018-12-11 23:45:00 Also, I'm currently doing the usual " oh shit I don't know if the oil I bought will look any good" and the old "shit I can't tell if I did a good sanding job" so you know, I'm fairly busy as well.

153 2018-12-11 23:44:35 But who can hook me up with some oil carts ??
154 2018-12-11 23:44:20 I have not seen that one yet. But why do men still wear gloves, curl in the squat rack, and use a pad on the squat bar? Also, why can't most men still not bench 315 for reps?

159 2018-12-11 23:43:32 Isn't it obvious the oil rich Islamic countries are pouring money into US conglomerates? These are Islamic companies here in the US and have conflict of interest. 1) CEOs shouldnt take their money (won't happen) 2) stop using these Middle Eastern owned services
160 2018-12-11 23:43:32 He doesn’t support them because he has business ties to them... he supports them because they’re a major contributor to our oil supply.
161 2018-12-11 23:43:29 Yes, in that scenario. I’m talking about the whole world getting off oil, you know, to stop global warming?

Defund ALL the petro-terrorists (Russia, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Texans...). 

Admittedly, it ain’t gonna be easy — they will want to hold onto their golden geese.
162 2018-12-11 23:43:28 Creed 2 was poppin lol. I really went to go see that shit at 1 in the afternoon yesterday. Had my sushi, oil pen, and sour patch on deck. I had a good ass time with myself lmao  for the ppl who asked me, YES ITS A MUST SEE

167 2018-12-11 23:43:06 GOP would probably have approved a sentient oil monster. 

But I get the frustration.
168 2018-12-11 23:43:05 MBS will wear this human rights atrocity around his neck forever. It doesn't matter how much oil he controls, he ain't washing this pariah juice off his putrid soul. Those butchers came to that embassy with ear plugs so they wouldn't be haunted from the death screaming. LOW LIFE
169 2018-12-11 23:43:03 VERY, VERY, CORRUPT. 

I’m betting that he made a ton of ‘laundered’  off of oil drilling deals from Bear Ears National Monument. (ie., hidden in shell companies)

But we shouldn’t worry at all because I’m sure he goes to church on Sundays.
170 2018-12-11 23:43:01 snake oil salesman Sturgeons little political gambit didn't come off did it
171 2018-12-11 23:42:58 Looks like an oil pan repair. Been there .
172 2018-12-11 23:42:26 Industrial Hemp is the only resource that can rival Big Oil. There are so many other ways to fuel vehicles. Just research all the products that hemp can produce. And it can be used as fuel. There is no excuses. Petroleum production is the problem. It kills the world in many ways.

177 2018-12-11 23:42:03 I know how to change oil in a car
178 2018-12-11 23:42:02 Is that an oil filter?
179 2018-12-11 23:41:57 おはようございまーす！
180 2018-12-11 23:41:55 With this one I ask for more studies published in research journals proving the claim. Cause the research I read into a few years ago was positive towards coconut oil...

No real estate moguls, no oil tycoons, no hedge fund managers... Fuck them all.

It's easy to remember why I voted for a community organizer.
183 2018-12-11 23:41:48 I think people would get tired of a shady looking dude covered in oil, so I didn't even bother.

191 2018-12-11 23:41:08 The price of oil is only about 5% of the global market. And increase in that one commodity causes an exponential increase on all other commodities.
Fuel taxes are devastating to the transportation industry which moves all goods. 
This tax hurts poor people.
192 2018-12-11 23:40:54 Yes, that is the Chinese play in particular around the world. Watch how much PDVSA oil gets sent to China over the next decade to service Venezuelan debt (as but one example).

Everything piled on top of one chip?
A really weird nacho thing?
Chips ground up and sprinkled on the rice, wasabi and olive oil?
I'm so confused?
196 2018-12-11 23:40:37 i learned about the jojoba oil from the japanese girls who would come into the body shop and buy it up for their hair.
197 2018-12-11 23:40:35 Alberta has...
Open culture: If you're White, Hetero, Anglo, Cis, and Male.
Work Ethic: As long as it's in the job sector you wanted.
Entrepreneurial Focus: Through the most per capita corporate welfare of any province.
Production: But only oil, gas or beef.
198 2018-12-11 23:40:30 I’m really starting to think Oil & Gas companies have too much power & sway over government...

205 2018-12-11 23:40:01 What’s it like playing in Lucas Oil Stadium in December? Do you need a map to find it?
206 2018-12-11 23:39:55 LMAO you don't put it on the roots, just the shaft of the hair and not heavy. jojoba is closer to the natural oils of the skin and hair. and you do it before conditioner. or with deep conditioner. black caster oil is heavy, so only tiny bit.  1/2

208 2018-12-11 23:39:50 One of the only people i’ve ever heard of to get a court-backed refund from a hoor. What a legend.
209 2018-12-11 23:39:48 Who cares...we really don't need their oil...let them suffer financially like they made us suffer financially, they will go broke because of how they have structured their economy
210 2018-12-11 23:39:44 Sounds like Notley is doing a decent job diversifying. Oil has jumped almost 20$/brrl since her last move also.

215 2018-12-11 23:38:57 I go in for a simple oil change and tire rotation and end up needing $1,000 worth of shit done to my car. Goodbye.
216 2018-12-11 23:38:54 Love the smell of coconut oil.
217 2018-12-11 23:38:53 really tempted to buy the nyarlathotep themed essential oil blend
218 2018-12-11 23:38:53 Palm oil is by far the worst
219 2018-12-11 23:38:51 I might come visit one day. But getting more brain damage for very little pay is it on the agenda these days. Trying to move onward and up word of life... but, still trying to find it effective way to stir the oil into almond butter LOL 
220 2018-12-11 23:38:47 Peanut oil is far superior, bacon grease is pretty good for meats
221 2018-12-11 23:38:21 let’s also not forget that when alberta is booming because oil is high, ontario and quebec suffer because high dollar kills manufacturers... harper was fine with Canada’s episode of dutch disease but yes let’s all believe that alberta just sends money to the lazy provinces
222 2018-12-11 23:38:17 White rice + bbq potato chips + wasabi + a lil olive oil just might be a slice of heaven.
223 2018-12-11 23:38:07 Hmm.. you don't really notice how much oil Olive garden cooks with until you reheat it the next day #stillgoodthough
224 2018-12-11 23:38:05 Last night my homie showed me vids of competitive dog racing thru obsitcle courses and it was so adorable. the oil puppers just zoom around and look so cute and happy. Highly reccomend looking it up if you're bored
225 2018-12-11 23:38:05 Anecdotal stories does not a movement make. I'm from Sask and have lived in BC, AB, ON and SK. The only time I see or hear about Separation, it's from angry Cons in AB upset when someone suggests Oil isn't the 'thing' any more....
226 2018-12-11 23:38:03 I don't think this is a good take. This is not corporate donations, it's people employed in the oil industry. From my rough googling, something like 10% of the Texas workforce works in the oil industry, so I'm not sure you can tease out political influence there.
227 2018-12-11 23:38:01 Right, the effects of spraying seawater are irreversible, because it moves ecosystems to lower states. Evolution takes billions of years. Society rests on top of the environment. If the environment is damaged, society falls into the cracks. No one will die from killing an oil co.
228 2018-12-11 23:38:00 tea tree oil is one of the worst smells i’ve ever smelled
229 2018-12-11 23:37:53 I wish you could order an oil change online
230 2018-12-11 23:37:44 More like W Brett's age. Oil person. I would have thrown the wine at him but it was too good 
231 2018-12-11 23:37:43 Perhaps the solution is... a mix of BOTH?? Fries & Tots, with rosemary, garlic, and olive oil lightly sprinkled on them?

233 2018-12-11 23:37:00 Prospect for oil at George Washington University.
234 2018-12-11 23:36:58 No they don't. The new cement plant in Quebec never even had an environmental assessment, nevermind a gender assessment. They are exempt. Coal plants in the maritimes - exempt. LNG facility - exempt. Oil sector - 80 % exempt. See above. The only ones paying are us pions.

236 2018-12-11 23:36:55 It’s Oil. The USD is the worlds reserve currency for Oil. 

The military is used to protect that. 

If China gets Saudi to trade in Yuan - others will follow -

That will be war like we haven’t seen since WW2.
237 2018-12-11 23:36:49 7,000 miles later got my oil changed.........
238 2018-12-11 23:36:40 Ohhhhh is it like that commercial that come on at like 3am and they b like “I got the miracle oil and put it on my hands and the next day I played a scratch off and PRAISE JESUS I won 100,000 dollars”
239 2018-12-11 23:36:35 Thanks.   yes.  pup is single acting. they say my pumo can do it just need more oil.  and it lifts slow

243 2018-12-11 23:36:06 I’ve got an electric chainsaw. With the right grease/oil and a low duty cycle (because heat), it may work in space.
244 2018-12-11 23:35:47 I tweeted regarding the effectiveness of CBD oil and asked, why is it getting so expensive making it unaffordable to those it benefits?
245 2018-12-11 23:35:26 Eh, I'll just put it under my tongue. I'd rather have my tits rubbed with warming oil.
246 2018-12-11 23:35:24 Try evening prime rose oil, it doesn’t dilate you but it helps you efface & helps with the delivery. I started taking them 2 days before my water broke and I had a smooth delivery
247 2018-12-11 23:35:12 Sorry the oil, gas and coal companies want to keep on extracting. The same companies give huge amounts of money to both Democrats and Republicans. That money is for something and isn't for policy that will stop climate change.
248 2018-12-11 23:35:12 The irritating thing about PHAs is you walk out feeling older and more decrepit than when you walked in = a new subscription for fish oil
249 2018-12-11 23:35:10 Just got my oil changed and they asked me 49572 questions like I would know the answers. I miss Peel’s.
250 2018-12-11 23:35:04 Proving a negative effect of CO2 on GW is very difficult...as is proving CO2's direct effect on GW. There is NO ACCEPTABLE solution, regardless. Select nations would have to pay the costs of 120 years of world wide climate abuse denying the progress of western society using oil.

252 2018-12-11 23:34:46 Holy shit this stuffy nose is infuriating! Someone suggested oregano oil? Does it really work?!
253 2018-12-11 23:34:43 Cameroon is Africa's third largest producer of palm oil.
254 2018-12-11 23:34:30 Two countries stopped pricing their oil in USD in the year 2000. Who were they? Iraq and Iran. How did our relationship with them evolve from that moment? Well, it wasn't good.
255 2018-12-11 23:34:28 Agreed. Oil&arms deals tainting our politics, esp w/ SA recently - are a real problem if we want to lead by example.
If we sell out what we allege to stand for- & stand by countries far removed from any govt of the ppl, it makes our credibility & our support cheap.
Regardless of$
256 2018-12-11 23:34:27 strong boys are to long boys what motor oil is to a bowl of pasta. no fucking way is that one happeninh
257 2018-12-11 23:34:22 Japan attacked Pearl Harbor because we stopped suppling them with oil and it was going to hinder their ability to continue their war machine. So they attacked and hoped they could take out our navy which would pretty much make us futile in the Pacific
258 2018-12-11 23:34:19 So you haven't had to deal with a fuel increase. 
That means it's not the cost of oil.
It's tax.
259 2018-12-11 23:34:17 getting my oil changed gives me confidence I don’t deserve
260 2018-12-11 23:34:11 Not all the oil companies, just the Irving’s...
261 2018-12-11 23:33:58 when did coconut oil become a health food?? i thought it was common knowledge that it's terrible for you~
262 2018-12-11 23:33:55 Sturgeons snake oil salesman pitch failed we didn't take the bait, as you were
263 2018-12-11 23:33:45 I thought you put oil on rice.

Motor oil.
264 2018-12-11 23:33:44 Real simple, you need power.  For your electric cars, and heat, air conditioning, cellphones, etc.....Where from? And, keep it affordable?   You hate oil. You hate nuclear. You hate coal. Wind-not enough available, solar-not enough available, water turbines- not enough available.
265 2018-12-11 23:33:43 Yes those to recent oil fields will be a real drag on our economy!
266 2018-12-11 23:33:32 Shea moisture Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil line will be your best friend then. And as for oil, something like olive oil, castor oil, and and oil really as long as it's not super light or coconut oil. Coconut oil is good for moisturizing but not as a sealer.
267 2018-12-11 23:33:31 do you do hot oil treatments with jojoba and black caster oil?
268 2018-12-11 23:33:21 Never,hash oil ,not a little dab will do you.still not legal in RI.went to Massachusetts the line was a mile long...oh hell no,I'm to old for that noise
269 2018-12-11 23:33:19 Well haven't you already got her to lose the election? So why worry? Kenney will fix the loss of our only customer? How? They are now independent of us and if we refine the oil we only have eastern Canada to sell to because I doubt Kenney is able to convince BC to ship to sea.
270 2018-12-11 23:33:02 We have done almost nothing about climate change. The oil, gas and oil companies want to keep on extracting carbon. To stop climate change we need to stop extracting carbon. +
271 2018-12-11 23:33:01 Remember, we do have a PM who is a self-declared feminist. This nonsense hurts men AND women working in the industry, people need to read your book "Ethical Oil"
272 2018-12-11 23:32:56 Get yourself RSO Rick Simpson Oil ...
273 2018-12-11 23:32:53 “My jam is oil paint. This is why I go to Basel...but you’re not into art.”
“I love art!!”
-straight date I’m unfortunate enough to be witness to
274 2018-12-11 23:32:50 Question, CBD oil is proving its worth, why then are companies pushing up prices to make it unaffordable to those it benefits?
275 2018-12-11 23:32:42 Doesn't that depend on why the oil price crashed? If the cause is a massive increase in oil supply that would be a material net benefit for global growth. Oil price impact on core CPI is fairly unimportant re causing deflation
276 2018-12-11 23:32:39 ถ้าไม่คาดหวังก็จะไม่ผิดหวัง
277 2018-12-11 23:32:25 I get that a lot. It's an interesting discussion. Pills vs Pot.  
I had a dear friend found out she had Cancer. I offered her Simpson Oil. She said, "No, no! I'm an alcoholic! I don't do drugs!". My response was, "What in the hell is Chemo and all the pills?" She didnt make it.

The brownie mix calls for water, egg and oil. Is there anything I can substitute for the egg? Just leave the egg out? Like it gooey! ?
285 2018-12-11 23:31:28 Russia and Venezuela, two oil rich states getting buzy. Its a bit like the US and their arms buying oil buddies the Saudis cosying up, minus the slaughtered Yemini schoolchildren, Syrian mass murder and the butchered journalist. Nice looking planes!
286 2018-12-11 23:31:21 Your idea makes little sense to me, but clearly neither of us are experts. 

Thinking logically, wouldn't cutting Russia's oil and killing their economy exponentially increase the demand for Middle Eastern oil, enriching the countries who are the worst sponsors of terrorism...?

@KhawajaMAsif 
PMLn shud raise this issue in parliment
288 2018-12-11 23:31:11 Try heating up some cooking oil and throwing them in the oil for a few seconds...my wife does this for enchiladas and they don’t crack...just a few seconds
289 2018-12-11 23:30:59 Actually NO - Oil is not a regenerating mineral.  We are getting a lot more due to good discoveries and fracking.
290 2018-12-11 23:30:55 everyone it was Grace Hopper we have known about the oil probably since the 60's. Watch that cartoon when you can find it.
291 2018-12-11 23:30:51 I knew it was bad when I researched how to make edibles. THC is fat soluble, so the best oil to use to make brownies/cakes/etc. is coconut because of the ridiculous saturated fat content...
292 2018-12-11 23:30:50 Just defined the self employed modern publican, not minding getting a text about waste oil recycling collection at 11.30pm and putting out ready for early morning  collection. @BIIandBIIAB
293 2018-12-11 23:30:46 oh you mean did Macron work for the one that did the oil and mining investments? no clue
294 2018-12-11 23:30:35 I swearrrrrrrrr , like don’t even waste your time just cope some edibles from the dispensary and buy some carts with the thc oil , cause the weed . Yeah that shit trash
295 2018-12-11 23:30:33 The Chinese make direct investments in renminbi and will collect directly. The IMF need not apply (i.e., is irrelevant in those transactions). Watch how much of PDVSA oil goes to China over the next decade as an example.

297 2018-12-11 23:30:29 coconut oil is one of the most overrated food products pushed by every bad health food blog
298 2018-12-11 23:30:13 Garnier’s charcoal scrub is <$10! I would use it just once a day/ every other day bc despite what it says on the instructions, you don’t use a scrub every day bc stripping the oil from your skin like that actually causes your face to produce more oil.
299 2018-12-11 23:30:10 I would guess that pup would be a single acting hoist? My pup is, truck is continuous. Therefore required an extra reservoir and a shit ton more oil. Turned into more of an ordeal than I orig. thought I admit. fav part is I had a truck w hitch already; keep payment low.
300 2018-12-11 23:30:10 My 8 year old heard @AdamSandler The Thanksgiving Song and heard one line as “my brother likes to masterpiece with baby oil.” NOBODY TELL HIM THE TRUTH
301 2018-12-11 23:30:06 blah blah blah Justine, just another lovely tweet in your quest to win a global humanitarian award & be Mr. Popular w/ other (real) leaders (who get shit done) and laugh at you, pretty boy!
fix the oil pipeline fiasco so we can actually generate some revenues for you to give away
302 2018-12-11 23:29:52 Grandma's off her meds again.
303 2018-12-11 23:29:38 Oil isn’t just for cars
304 2018-12-11 23:29:35 Shower thoughts time! Can a vegan volcano goddess be appeased with extra virgin olive oil?
305 2018-12-11 23:29:09 @afowler06 is your man for the CBD oil Nick.
306 2018-12-11 23:29:00 welp, my car just decided to die after I got the oil changed :)
307 2018-12-11 23:28:40 came home for winter break to find that we're now a krill oil household
308 2018-12-11 23:28:40 hakan oil rape
309 2018-12-11 23:28:38 I hear you ate looking for a new Chief of Staff. I would like to apply. I have a BS AND MS. I can lie with the best of them, I can manage individuals, I watch Fox News, I worked for a fence company, I have investments in oil, put gas in my vehicle and I have built on others land
310 2018-12-11 23:28:36 It's clear that big oil is still trying to shut down the conversation on climate breakdown with US, Russia and Saudi Arabia all failing to back the requirement for urgent action. I fear that civil action, especially in the latter would lead to OTT responses, maybe deaths
311 2018-12-11 23:28:34 Yes! I used to see huge oil refinery far deep in the desert during road trips here in Saudi. They do look like cities at night. Always mesmerized by them. I hope I can get the chance to visit a refinery at least once in my life.
312 2018-12-11 23:28:31 Neh 10:3 And he did that which was our mouth is smoother than oil:
313 2018-12-11 23:28:29 $KRE No chatter on regional banks exposer to oil and gas companies this time around as the price of oil declines precipitously.
314 2018-12-11 23:28:21 does icyhot count as an essential oil
315 2018-12-11 23:28:05 Most fast food options for my vegetarian kid are…fries. And she knows they’re probably made in the same oil as chicken nuggets, so she doesn’t want them. Taco Bell has a *ton* of vegetarian things. 
316 2018-12-11 23:27:50 She’s got oil smudged on her hands and looks like she hasn’t slept in a few days.

Yes, hello, she’s new and she’s terrified.
317 2018-12-11 23:27:49 Go to iwo road bab onilu or afanet near world oil iwo road
318 2018-12-11 23:27:45 congrats!! sana oil 
319 2018-12-11 23:27:38 A complete government takeover of the oil industry is an option worth exercising. More effective than a carbon tax too.
320 2018-12-11 23:27:37 So, your plan is to spray the roads with oil increasing the business, keeping the trucks out of the garage and more room for more Jags?
321 2018-12-11 23:27:30 Lmao team natural clutch af, all i gotta do is braid my hair down at night & put my bonnet on. Then in the morning put coconut oil in my hair & comb it out 
322 2018-12-11 23:27:19 A stellar job Andrew. It’s been a tough christening by fire but she’s fine wonderful things for ABns in safety, health, education, quality of life and now the oil industry.
323 2018-12-11 23:27:13 Lol the cold and me mix just as well as oil and water 
324 2018-12-11 23:27:09 AKA grade A snake oil salesman political posturing from Sturgeon
325 2018-12-11 23:27:07 Um yeah. Lowest unemployment in decades (lowest ever for minorities), isis who?, economy is booming, China is conceding and no more dependence on foreign oil. But sure, he doesn’t know what he’s doing. I guess this is all credit to Barrack right? Lol
326 2018-12-11 23:27:06 Well can you blame them? Trump is not a deal-maker or negotiator. He's a snake oil salesman and juvenile baby of a man whom has hissy-fits when he doesn't get his way. Why should any party take him seriously?
327 2018-12-11 23:27:03 They could prevent it by stopping to invade and bomb the middle east for oil.
328 2018-12-11 23:26:45 Y'all remember the Buhari administration promised to diversify the economy. If oil price crash today, same arguments like before.
329 2018-12-11 23:26:22 Anyone who takes CBD oil, can you give me advice please? I went into the pharmacy to pickup my meds and they had it there for sale, but it was a tiny bottle which was only 5%.

What dose would be best for someone with chronic pain on high doses of morphine for 20+ years?
330 2018-12-11 23:26:16 I never take my makeup off before I shower...... Most of it just comes off in there, and then I use coconut oil on my eyes.
331 2018-12-11 23:26:13 Oil feild???
332 2018-12-11 23:26:10 @SteveSchmidtSES I watched you on Nicolle's show! Why the Republicans changed is they taken dirty ! McConnell & Ryan all of them! Oil  from Koch's Network which includes Putin! Oilman have no Country! Let's start there & then have a conversation! Thanks Steve
333 2018-12-11 23:26:08 Looks like you haven't been drinking as much as you should.
334 2018-12-11 23:26:07 Boys use lube, men use motor oil. Everybody knows that.
335 2018-12-11 23:26:06 Oil is an abiotic, self regenerating and abundant compound !   Oil companies are drilling every day at 10000 meters and fossil fuels cannot be found below 5000 meters !  This proves that oil is not a fossil fuel ! To tax oil is ludicrous and preposterous !
336 2018-12-11 23:25:54 If you use essential oils, diffuse some clove/rosemary/lemon. I also like to dilute the peppermint oil and rub it on my abdomen, back of neck and on my temples. Soothes aches and relives tummy issues.
337 2018-12-11 23:25:48 It means stop blaming the snake oil salesman for people buying snake oil. People keep thowing away their votes or ate voting for what they want for a government.
338 2018-12-11 23:25:45 So the Oil Panic is a reflector now.
339 2018-12-11 23:25:44 original argan oil. its my holy item
340 2018-12-11 23:25:42 Maybe there’s still hope Andrew, with NDP govt!  I see Ms.Notley calling for a refinery. That’s stellar! Great long term jobs for  so many! Hubby used to work in construction in the patch before forced to retire early with oil price crash. Smart Premier you guys! 
341 2018-12-11 23:25:36 Need some CBD Oil
342 2018-12-11 23:25:28 Oil isn’t cheap, and going under your car to deal with a skid plate that causes enough trouble is why it’s kind of up there. Even more expensive if you’re driving a european vehicle that only takes full synthetic
343 2018-12-11 23:25:19 Scotland has the oil, gas,  generated power and food surpluses beyond our consumption. The UK holds the £ trillion debt.
344 2018-12-11 23:25:18 oreos contain HFCS, vanillin, soy lecithin, and palm oil
345 2018-12-11 23:25:16 Randall took the day off and took my car to get an oil change and tires rotated. Super thankful for him every single day. Love you boo 
346 2018-12-11 23:25:14 all individual though a super pill would be great! it’s a multivitamin in addition to the others (also fish oil, forgot that one!)

348 2018-12-11 23:25:05 As long as France participates in bombing middle-eastern countries for oil, retaliations like these will happen.
349 2018-12-11 23:25:03 Hemp is a political, oversold, and over-hyped solution for agriculture. The international acreage has been static for over 20 years ... not scalable as a major agricultural crop but some ... probably tobacco companies ... will make $$$ as snake oil. Yada yada yada
350 2018-12-11 23:25:03 Really want fried mushrooms but..oil
351 2018-12-11 23:24:50 Don't you worry about us Queenie.  We've got. Oil, Gas, Whisky & a shit load of Fish
352 2018-12-11 23:24:46 Alberta isn't getting equalization payments because of their government in the province. The oil is in Alberta, but what happens there affects the whole country
353 2018-12-11 23:24:37 But on the issue of climate change Labour just said they support the Oil and Gas sector in Scotland. Frackings a non-issue as all it is is the well type. The wells will be drilled somewhere no matter any fracking or not.
354 2018-12-11 23:24:34 Those two yogi and warrior are arguing using Conservative sites to justify their idotic views. It's ridiculous and a waste of our time. People this delusional can't be reasoned with. I blocked them both. We are in trouble and they are buying the Big Oil bullshit, it's just sad.
355 2018-12-11 23:24:21 First time putting oil in my car by myself today so I’m doing great
356 2018-12-11 23:24:06 Tommy your cbd oil is shit....   If it doesn’t get you high it doesn’t heal.....

358 2018-12-11 23:23:36 yeah, that oil sands production must have all been suspended ;)
359 2018-12-11 23:23:20 wash twice a day w dr bronners unscented or lavender(calming & promotes healing). also make a mixture of a tablespoon of coconut oil w 4-6 drops of tea tree oil! i used the mixture for my conch and the painful keloid that was forming was gone overnight!
360 2018-12-11 23:23:14 Only becuase they want to get them uneducated demographic that think it is possible to live with out gas and oil.  You are the fool to not see they are using you and will drop you just as fast
361 2018-12-11 23:23:04 That's fine.  Drink loads of water. Bump up your fat intake by dressing your salad with olive oil vinaigrettes, cooking your eggs in butter and bump up your protein too... Eggs and tuna are your friends. Eat them all! No fruit or carbs or you'll continue to crave.

364 2018-12-11 23:22:27 Use the none THC one, the CBD oil
365 2018-12-11 23:22:03 Feel like chugging a bottle of DayQuil and going to sleep but this oil change taking a minute whyyyyy
366 2018-12-11 23:21:58 so i thought my car was a piece of shit lately but i put air in my tires and got an oil change and turns out im the piece of shit
367 2018-12-11 23:21:55 thank God my skin can tolerate silicone and mineral oil, for those yang still tak jumpa product apa yang sesuai dengan your skin tolerance, don't give up okay. I'm here to help 
368 2018-12-11 23:21:53 Things that went wrong today at work;
1. The fry vat spilled oil all over the floor
2. I had to clean it, which took over an hour
3. There were only two people in kitchen
4. It was busy as FUCK
5. We ran out of buns

Today i was truly mcfucked
369 2018-12-11 23:21:52 If the oil company is privately owned, you won't need to care whether they are profiteering or losing oil or throwing birthday parties because the petrol retailers can (and do) import petrol directly, bypassing Petrojam entirely.
370 2018-12-11 23:21:48 Watching some world news ! Also paying attention to the stocks for currency, crude oil, bitcoin and Apple !
371 2018-12-11 23:21:37 just our Oil Allies, fighting for freedominess
372 2018-12-11 23:21:22 This is about executives in the oil industry and a specific pledge which Beto opted to sign and then opted to violate
373 2018-12-11 23:20:50 If you want that nice greasy mouthfeel and taste on things, use coconut oil. If you want a buttery flavor too, use half coconut oil and half Earth Balance. If you like pork fat on things I can give you a bacon grease substitute recipe I created.
374 2018-12-11 23:20:50 いります
375 2018-12-11 23:20:43 There are jobs available in Alberta, saying otherwise would be a lie. Just because they aren't in oil and gas doesn't mean they don't exist. Unwillingness to retrain on the feds dime is the fault of the men and women who pass up the opportunity.
376 2018-12-11 23:20:40 My car has been saying “change oil soon” for the past week but then I remember seeing @84Tylor  snap chat and hers being like  -150 so I think I’m good for now 
377 2018-12-11 23:20:29 Oil and footjob scene hun u need to use those feet
378 2018-12-11 23:20:23 Al i need is oil
379 2018-12-11 23:20:16 Ask Beto why he signed the pledge including disavowing donations from execs at oil companies. Not sludges standard, it’s his.
380 2018-12-11 23:20:16 @narloa Mandarin Cleansing Oil
381 2018-12-11 23:20:13 Gas prices dropping are good until your family works in the oil/gas industry...
382 2018-12-11 23:19:59 That’s the way Jed Clampett discovered oil. 
383 2018-12-11 23:19:59 Give me credible sources I’ll happily read. How about you read about the control big oil has.  Many Seminal Publications
384 2018-12-11 23:19:57 Almost home to play some fortnite, the boys best be on @jbearbelow @IryjahB @spearsidingsta1 but @Hornzane1 be on that VBucks grind at the oil rigs lol
385 2018-12-11 23:19:47 Hey I agree but how do you avoid it when the oil business brings in so much money. You can't. It's just the way it is. Smart oil workers banked money when times were good and now they are living off their savings.
386 2018-12-11 23:19:45 かわいいー！！！！
387 2018-12-11 23:19:22 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
388 2018-12-11 23:19:11 BS.Ojeda chose to believe GOP lies.
The woman was realistic about the future of coal. Her party promised to keep ACA going and keep transition career training for coal miners.
Ojeda chose the snake oil salesman who wanted to end ACA but promised coal is coming back.
Bad judgment.
389 2018-12-11 23:19:10 Yeah... removing federal responsibility for safe drinking water, and giving the responsibility to the state. While at the same time federally allowing oil and coal extractions to pollute water, and then blaming the state for not keeping their drinking water clean 
390 2018-12-11 23:19:00 Systemic inequities have resulted in more than 1.8 million Latinos living within a half mile of oil & gas facilities. As this administration expands extraction on #PublicLands, these numbers will only rise. More: @ChieftainNewshttps://bit.ly/2Eaargd

392 2018-12-11 23:18:57 Waiting for my oil to heat up for my fried chicken~~~
393 2018-12-11 23:18:45 It’s easy! You should try it next time. Buy the raw corn tortillas. Heat about a quarter inch of oil. Use tongs and hold a shell half in the oil so it’s kind of bent, and with your other hand spoon in some meat. Then fold over. Let it fry for a bit then flip.
394 2018-12-11 23:18:41 Kakain ng OLIVE OIL?!
395 2018-12-11 23:18:38 If the oil company is privately owned will OUR protect us from any possible profiteering? I have no confidence of that.
396 2018-12-11 23:18:21 Yes. Makes me remember interesting behaviours… Khashoggi vs. Scripal. Things are different when you need oil money.  You are free to murder anyone if you have lot of oil. Sad to see this kind of moralists. Murdering has nothing to do with freedom. Its  a deal.
397 2018-12-11 23:18:20 (cont) reverses this equation, burning fuel (carbon) w/ O2 -> water, CO2 (exhaled) + solar energy (by which we live)
4) ~1.5Tr tons of CO2 recirculates annually in the biosphere, life sustaining itself on captured solar energy.

5) probl is burning C (coal/oil) takes O2 (cont)
398 2018-12-11 23:18:18 It’s not a dick measuring contest Shawn, we are talking about Oil here. And I do well enough.

401 2018-12-11 23:18:05 i dreamt my house was burning down - the only thing i saved was my first oil painting of a skeleton. later, i picked up objects - tiny bacterial red bugs writhed beneath
402 2018-12-11 23:18:02 FACTS 
Obama approved large number of oil pipelines.

BHO fracked the entire country while HRC as SoS, sold fracking to the world.

BHO opened up the Arctic to oil drilling twice.

Both parties are bribed by same big money donors to represent their interests at OUR expense.
403 2018-12-11 23:18:00 I find it really helps! I eyeball it but I'd say about 2 parts brown sugar 1 part honey 1 part oil
404 2018-12-11 23:17:55 #tytlive @realDonaldTrump is asking Americans to pay for the Tariffs. He's asking them to pay for the Tax Cuts For The Rich. He's asking us to pay more for our Gas & Oil. And now he wants us to pay for his wall. BULLSHIT!
405 2018-12-11 23:17:43 @PnPCBC WOW !!  Alberta to build a refinery. Since Harper as PM I've been saying Alberta needs to build 1 - 2 refineries instead of sending our oil outside of Canada. I Tweeted Rachel Notely a few times that Alberta needs to build refineries, I guess she listened.
406 2018-12-11 23:17:37 I used to use wild growth it made my hair longer but now I’m using Castor Oil and my hair getting thicker
407 2018-12-11 23:17:21 Line 3 was approved, is under construction & will be finished in 6 months.  Keystone XL has been approved & is three-quarters built.  We are heading for a pipeline glut.  The only Canadians buying Saudi oil are the Irvings (who could buy Newfoundland oil instead - blame Irvings)
408 2018-12-11 23:17:14 My post states nothing about climate change, it is about a hollywood "expert" who had no clue that chinooks have been occurring for thousands of years.  He was blaming the chinook on the oil industry.  FYI I do believe in limiting pollution but NOT in taxing essentials for Fun

412 2018-12-11 23:16:45 Alhamdulillah
413 2018-12-11 23:16:39 you see why our Meat is such a high price in the UK now , We pay the same as the EU .
Price discovery gone out the window or supply and demand determining the price .
The meat Market is now like the oil price Fixed by a Cartel

416 2018-12-11 23:16:24 A little coconut oil can also help with managing things
417 2018-12-11 23:16:20 Why so much? Iran was legal under Obama global treaty until Trump put Iran on  sanction because   Putin and MBS want to sell more oil globally.  Thus,  is this a big deal   compare to Trump election fraud or his family  criminal business   enterprise?
418 2018-12-11 23:16:09 LW: Leaked Memo: Government Scientists Warned Trumps Oil Plan Would Threaten Alaskas Polar Bears
419 2018-12-11 23:15:58 Did everyone go back in time and think this is the "golden age of oil" and we can burn the stuff with no consequences? Did we forget the dire warnings from the UN?
420 2018-12-11 23:15:58 Do castor oil really work? I’m ready to have this baby 
421 2018-12-11 23:15:57 That percentage of earth scientists which are employed by oil / coal / gas companies probably can’t express their concern openly - but they may feel the same
422 2018-12-11 23:15:49 get some beard oil on there that’ll relax it a little
423 2018-12-11 23:15:46 Get an air fryer like the tefal actifry the chips are very good you only need a teaspoon of oil
424 2018-12-11 23:15:44 It's about time. It has never made sense to ship crude oil to the US and the the gas back to Canada. Not to mention it's more expensive.
425 2018-12-11 23:15:43 Thanks for that article. As a result of it, & because I want to stay out of trouble as a professional retail oil trading, "second-level" thinker, I, too, am abandoning the need to have an Argentine polo pony and shuttering my publicly traded "tanning" company with one shop. #OOTT
426 2018-12-11 23:15:40 Why should we get penalised for a successful past? It’s ludacdis. Look at the financial model post Highbury. Negative net spend. Best players out every window. All the while Russian and oil money coming to the fore. Oh, and 4 real trophies.
427 2018-12-11 23:15:37 Last time I was @ state park in Fl I asked about the cleanup because I felt 4 the little crabs covered. I was told there is 0 oil N water. I could see it!
428 2018-12-11 23:15:37 おいるさん、ありらじっす～
429 2018-12-11 23:15:26 "Why would God Give Oil  if not to burn down the Garden ?  @Pontifex
430 2018-12-11 23:15:21 My car needs an oil change so bad..... kinda hope it blows up w me in it
431 2018-12-11 23:15:20 That's similar to the Bishop looking the other way when priests are exposed for pedophilia--there's a special place in the devil's boiling oil for the bishop & priests & Larry Nassar & Olympic officials--these are unspeakable & heinous crimes
432 2018-12-11 23:15:11 Home made sugar scrub time! It makes such a difference  Brown sugar, coconut oil and honey!
433 2018-12-11 23:15:08 it really works on pimples and black heads but I went crazy this time ripp.. omg really?? never tried that! does it work like tea tree oil?
434 2018-12-11 23:15:07 Como va mi semana? Mi guagua tiene “0 miles to empty” alert, “oil change required” alert, “low tire pressure” alert...  Y que nunca se olviden los wipers.. “low washer fluid” alert....
435 2018-12-11 23:15:04 This sounds incorrect.  I heard canola oil funded a study that proclaimed this.  Coconut oil is highly antifungal, antiparasitic, and has short chain fatty acids that can aid brain function.
436 2018-12-11 23:15:03 I’ve gotten asked what I want for Christmas *an oil change *a car wash *an eye exam *pay my car insurance *groceries *2 bras *mani/pedi this is my real deal list lol anything outside of this will still be appreciated lol
437 2018-12-11 23:14:57 Democrats did nothing,& facilitated the lack of regulations that caused the Goleta oil spill just a few years ago. This picture looks FAR better than the oil-soaked waters we had under Obama, which was a federally regulated pipeline, destroyed miles of coastline in Santa Barbara
438 2018-12-11 23:14:54 holy shit, i caused an oil fire for the first time, good thing i learned how to get rid of oil fires from home ec in high school. i actually applied school to real life situations
439 2018-12-11 23:14:53 いつもカリンのど飴なんだけど、林檎って見て林檎様……ってなってはちみつりんごになった
440 2018-12-11 23:14:46 That might be. But the vast majority of gas and oil in the UK comes from within Scottish waters. 96% of UK reserves. And yet...
441 2018-12-11 23:14:44 Trump says military to build border wall if Democrats refuse: REGARDLESS, IT'S "STEAL" A GREAT IDEA TO BRING ALL OUR SOLDIER BOYS OUT OF DA MIDDLE-EAST WHERE THEY NEVER EVER BELONGED IN DA FIRST PHUK'N PLACE ! LET DA REPUBLICUNT FINANCIAL & "OIL" CORP "KOCH"-SUKKAS HIRE THEIR OWN
442 2018-12-11 23:14:38 Me, too!  That was the the most eye opening thing I learned while working on the show.  Now I go around to friends' and families' homes and throw out old oil!
443 2018-12-11 23:14:32 Build own refinery is the right way! Good for Albertans & Canadians. Not exporting jobs, rude oil to US, China ... and re-importing our own oil at higher price! Prov & Feds should create policies to make it happens, not hand out big cash to corps.
444 2018-12-11 23:14:29 True that previous govts squandered oil wealth (e.g. Ralph Bucks) but that’s what AB’s wanted (we used to have health premiums). Comparison with Norway Sovereign Fund not quite apples to apples but Heritage Fund should be bigger. 1/
445 2018-12-11 23:14:29 I’m late to the party but will be burning the midnight oil alongside you guys....
446 2018-12-11 23:14:25 Hopefully you use synthetic oil 
447 2018-12-11 23:14:21 We need to shut you down for National security issues that includes you Donald you're a no good snake oil salesman which no one is buying just that small unhinged base of supporters you have.
448 2018-12-11 23:14:12 Iran was legal under Obama global treaty until Trump put Iran on sanction because   Putin and MBS want to sell more oil globally.  Thus, is this a big deal   compare to Trump election fraud or his family criminal business   enterprise?
449 2018-12-11 23:14:11 Wala namang chicken oil! hahaha
450 2018-12-11 23:14:07 I think it’s hilarious that John is getting my car an oil change for its 2nd “Birthday”
451 2018-12-11 23:13:58 Only normal average hard working Canadians pay, thats the Liberal Way, coal burners, oil sector big emittters are all exempt. Carbon Tax Scam

453 2018-12-11 23:13:47 @CookingIssues any tips on popping buckwheat? have had some success with hot oil in a pan but the yield ain't great, tends to scorch pretty easily
454 2018-12-11 23:13:37 おはようございます
455 2018-12-11 23:13:35 tea tree oil
456 2018-12-11 23:13:30 Very well-said Commissioner and valid points. We are trying to get the General Assembly to give eastern Ohio counties severance tax monies( generated from the shale industry) but we have been unsuccessful to date. We need roads paved from the heavy oil and gas industry use.
457 2018-12-11 23:13:26 オリーブ界の頂点はここだよ。
458 2018-12-11 23:13:08 Like little baguette toasts. And drizzled with olive oil
459 2018-12-11 23:13:05 Or, we go after those who continue to shut down pipelines that could carry  Canadian oil....  And here we are back at the beginning of our conversation hence the #hypocrisy
460 2018-12-11 23:12:59 IF YOU ARE A TRUE CONSERVATIVE, THERE IS NO WAY U COULD HAVE A LIBERAL FRIEND!! OIL AND WATER DO NOT MIX!!
461 2018-12-11 23:12:51 Having such a huge industry is not good. Especially one that relies so much on global markets. Times aren't always good. The oil industry is on borrowed time as it is.  I've seen more downturns than I care to remember. You can't rely too much on one business.
462 2018-12-11 23:12:44 I only hope when the oil stop leak-out, bad gas will eventually stop circulate n mash up people engine.
463 2018-12-11 23:12:29 Great photo, looks like somebody put chilli oil on his butt plug
464 2018-12-11 23:12:23 I'm not being flippant when I say cars need to be converted back to carriages. 

There is no way to mitigate climate change without shutting down the oil industry. 

Immediately. 

The longer we The People wait, the worse the future will be.
465 2018-12-11 23:12:19 I shouldn't be surprised that sourdough, olive oil and herbs go well together.

Although all I have is olive oil spray, so it's a bit non-traditional - it has to be sprayed on rather than dipped. It works though!
466 2018-12-11 23:12:10 Why every time I run into the oil man jay z got a new cologne 
467 2018-12-11 23:11:56 The basic goal is to transition oil& gas workers to #renewable energy (Canada is sitting on huge #geothermal potential) OR for example - the tech sector. Otherwise, Canada is currently on track for 4C warming w. our current leadership. We only have ~12yrs to cap warming at 1.5C!
468 2018-12-11 23:11:49 Man.. look, it’s really been a rough two days lmao I had olive oil running down to my elbows
469 2018-12-11 23:11:43 We won't even delve into the oil money yet.
470 2018-12-11 23:11:42 Norway has so much oil, they can afford to give away things.
471 2018-12-11 23:11:34 You should use Olive oil ... wherever possible! 
472 2018-12-11 23:11:22 Oh yes. Untold 1000s of data gatherers, researchers and analysts all around the world (from utterly different cultures, political backgrounds, and ranging from oil company surveyors to research scientists) are all colluding in a secret forum to..  something.. endgame.

#FlatEarth
473 2018-12-11 23:11:12 Funny.. Last few shutdowns life went on. Completely unaffected.

It's like threatening to pull the plug on my wife's essential oil Diffuser.

Doesn't do anything anyways.
474 2018-12-11 23:10:57 Thats been know for years..

Wonder about peanut oil though? Got 12 liters out of the dumpster some months ago. Cost 3 times that of olive oil here.   Suppose to be better?. Any views?
475 2018-12-11 23:10:55 tag yourself i'm the crisco-branded vegetable oil
476 2018-12-11 23:10:48 only use coconut oil
477 2018-12-11 23:10:41 i just put spme jojoba oil on my face before bed and it smells line some beans and rice but pretty hurts i GUESS

480 2018-12-11 23:10:34 Steve, what we really need is a shallow twat with trite, far right ideas, a true blue Tory patriot who's decided to live outside of the UK (pays better). We need someone with a snake oil salesman's smile. A self appointed empty head guru. Know anyone who might fit the bill?
481 2018-12-11 23:10:29 Congress has always neglected our veterans. Banks, oil, pharma, and rich people all get treated better by Congress than our veterans. You won't spend money on Vets because they don't have money to give to your party. Shame on all of you in Congress for your endless greed. #WeKnow
482 2018-12-11 23:10:27 Honestly who’s fucking idea was it to put an oil refinery in the middle of the god damn valley
483 2018-12-11 23:10:20 二重顎っていうか逆に顎がないよ。

485 2018-12-11 23:10:10 That’s what happens when we are controlled by Oil oligarchs both at home (Kochs) and abroad (Putin, Mohammed Bone Saw). Thanks to Rich Russian Citizens United.
486 2018-12-11 23:10:05 So.

We are losing the Artic.
We have lost 60% of animals (including the turtles that ain't laying in Terengganu)
And more American company wants to drill more oil while disregarding environmental impact.

So we are definitely heading to a crash we don't know of.
487 2018-12-11 23:09:50 Can we also consider that Alberta's decision to not have PST, to not diversify its economy, and to spend most of the Heritage Fund are important factors?

I mean, it's clear that oil is a dying industry and Alberta STILL won't start moving away from it.
488 2018-12-11 23:09:46 This guy decided to google me and saw the oil and gas articles I wrote that were published eons ago. Loooool. Respect ti de. Yazzzz, I drink a lot but I work hard too bih!
489 2018-12-11 23:09:37 Good question. Depends on how long it takes to build one and where the refined oil is going to go. We'll probably need oil for another 15 to 20 years. So, it's getting close to becoming marginal. #cdnpoli
490 2018-12-11 23:09:36 Agreed that alternative energy is the future, but we’ve got a long way to go before we can cut the oil cord. My preference is CDN oil over Saudi oil, for many reasons
491 2018-12-11 23:09:36 I am trying the pre- pooing technique with my natural hair again. I got me a huge jar of coconut oil
492 2018-12-11 23:09:31 Show me where of America oil wars and foreign meddling was in the constitution
493 2018-12-11 23:09:27 I took the time to oil &braid my hair so nice & neat
494 2018-12-11 23:09:10 I Literally Just Got 4 New Tires And A Oil Change For $400 
495 2018-12-11 23:09:09 With what we know today, there should be new fossil fuel extraction and infrastructure. They build these with the expectation they will profit from them for decades. Dems who are ok with expanding where oil and gas extraction can occur are part of the problem.
496 2018-12-11 23:08:53 Hmmm I'll admit I don't really deal with all out breakouts that aren't pillow or "oil from my hair" or clogged pores based. I'll ask my friend who had breakouts for advice. Brb.
497 2018-12-11 23:08:45 @annieshomegrown hi! Is there any way you could make the microwaveable macaroni and cheese without coconut oil? I bought some tonight and didn’t realize it had coconut oil, I’m allergic to coconut. Thank you!
498 2018-12-11 23:08:24 Going back to oil and gas....
499 2018-12-11 23:08:23 Don't you think our youth would not want you giving away Canadian oil for pennies on the dollar?  That's their future sir, and that revenue could offset the deficits you are racking up to pass onto our youth. Build a gawdamn pipeline already!!!
500 2018-12-11 23:08:16 At the same time they accept oil from saudi arabia. Pure hypocrisy and nonsense.
501 2018-12-11 23:08:11 Going back to oil and gas....
502 2018-12-11 23:08:00 Next day, add lemon juice+olive oil to taste + salt and pepper.
keeps for 2-3 days max. Usually gets eaten fast.
Remember: do not cook couscous, it gets soften by lemon juice and absorb the water from the peppers and tomatoes instead.
Goes great with BBQ
503 2018-12-11 23:07:48 The liquid we fight wars over in the future won't be oil.
504 2018-12-11 23:07:42 It was @Corbynsmama actually that said "The pot industry can out run the oil industry in revenue by a LONG shot". My point is that it's not easy to create $80,000,000,000/year in business. People are criticizing Alberta when they should be applauding them for such a huge business
505 2018-12-11 23:07:32 It’s broader in scope than traffic; all our “accidents” from oil spills to overdoses. You should read it. It’s good, I swear.
506 2018-12-11 23:07:13 For sure oil in general is looking somewhat of a sideways trade at best.
507 2018-12-11 23:07:09 Remember the power ranger on N64 where you were fighting pollution? Literally punching oil spills lmao
508 2018-12-11 23:07:01 Do you imagine if one day we realized that gold doesn't actually worth "that much", because well, nobody uses it for a real purpose -like oil or other commodities- and then, just like that, ~8 trillion USD were wiped out? 
That would be something amazing to watch.
509 2018-12-11 23:06:59 That and all the Thank You cards he has sent to Obama for getting Black/Hispanic unemployment rates to record lows, for becoming net exporter of oil, for 3%+ GDP growth, getting NK to table for nuke deal, Manufacturing jobs at 700k. You're so right about that!
510 2018-12-11 23:06:54 Congress corrupted system 60 years made polls corrupt with reservations, freebies, sops. Will they understand development, NPAs, Oil Bonds, defense spending etc if CONgress & Co keep promising sops blatantly appeasing minorities? Development loses to sops Vajpayeeji too suffered.
511 2018-12-11 23:06:49 Got my oil changed...now I feel comfortable driving...
512 2018-12-11 23:06:46 Is it rather thick and hard paper? Could have got humid making the fibres roll up. Happened to a lot of the drawing materials of my late granddad, he used a lot of oil colors.
513 2018-12-11 23:06:46 Second week into my job. managing to get through,with a mixture of pain meds and CBD oil. Every night I get home bent n broken, routine of massage and assisted bath...almost ready for next shift.Constant pins n needles in hand now though #versusarthritis
514 2018-12-11 23:06:45 Volta para @radiotupi para cobrir o @VascodaGama época boa que escutava você e o Jorge Nunes defendendo o clube no giro esportivo.
515 2018-12-11 23:06:40 Oh cool. Who's ur chief of staff? The janitor looking for a pay raise? Looks like u mix with ur staff like oil n water. Everywhere u go, they just scatter. Maybe u smell. That's Usually what I think when it happens to me. Maybe take a shower
516 2018-12-11 23:06:30 I recently carried out some work for an oil tycoon multi billionaire I asked him his thoughts on Brexit he said that it will not affect him either way stay or leave but for me my family friends & the peopled Britain 1 or 2 years down the road
517 2018-12-11 23:06:27 With the bad faith Vito of the  northern pipeline, stalled trans mountain and cowardly/treasonous play by Quebec purchasing(via st Laurence)Saudi oil over Alberta oil. All deals should be off the table. What more do they have to do before you shut the valve? No more $/oil
518 2018-12-11 23:06:25 Reminder to #Boston media:

CBD oil won’t get you high. 
519 2018-12-11 23:06:24 I feel you Lynda. 20+ yrs in Oil&Gas Ind. laid off 8 mos ago after 4 rounds of layoff’s, wage cuts etc. We must so better #Alberta #Canada  There are thousands of us needing work/incomes.
520 2018-12-11 23:06:23 Imagine how much money Clark Kent made working on that oil rig

523 2018-12-11 23:06:01 The way Nigeria is going low, we will soon discover oil
524 2018-12-11 23:05:59 Moving goal posts. Issue was Alberta potentially separating because of “anti-Alberta politics”, which is asinine. Is Trudeau doing a great job on pipelines? Nope. But is it because people are biased against Alberta or Oil industry? No, that’s just silly.
525 2018-12-11 23:05:56 I will never forget the time @racepuppy9895 couldn’t find his rlly nice flashlight for the longest time only to go change my oil and find it under my hood, from the last time he changed my oil
526 2018-12-11 23:05:34 Strangely all (most of ) the oil companies.
527 2018-12-11 23:05:34 Phillip Paulwell said he "put in measures" to reduce oil loss at PETROJAM. @PhillipPaulwell can you tell us the EXACT MEASURES you had in placé and also if you exactly what the problem/s  is/were which cost over 600,000 barrels of oil in "unaccounted losses".
528 2018-12-11 23:05:29 Mine: 2-300gCouscous (DO NOT COOK IT!), juice of 1 lemon, 2-3Tblsp Strong Olive oil, salt+pepper, 1 red and 1 green pepper cut in tiny cubes, 6+ tomatoes de-seeded cut in tiny cubes, mix. Add herbs (mint, parsley) and leave overnight covered in fridge.

530 2018-12-11 23:04:55 given that i recently had a latte with whole milk with added omega-3s that it turned out were from fish oil, the oat milk tastes fine by me
531 2018-12-11 23:04:52 【resource】資源、資金(名詞) This sea is rich in natural resources such as oil. #toeic #英語 #英会話
532 2018-12-11 23:04:49 How dare we send all our taxes including those from our oil and gas extraction to England and ask for something back!
533 2018-12-11 23:04:45 Not to mention emissions are a byproduct of oil and gas. I fail to see how these ppl are spared from their role in the problems they are creating. The other side of the coin, they know damn well that Industrial Hemp would out produce oil and gas any day. With very little waste.
534 2018-12-11 23:04:43 The left has continually bleated that we need to refine our oil here.

If the TMX is carrying refined product, environmentalists have said they wouldn’t oppose it.

Bluff is being called.
535 2018-12-11 23:04:42 I’m so excited for this gelato oil I’m getting this weekend
536 2018-12-11 23:04:41 Like turning iron wire into musical steel string. Was there olive oil? (E8 Fromage)
537 2018-12-11 23:04:40 The peppermint oil will help keep them out (and so will making sure food is stored in plastic, dishes done, etc.) Pros know where to place traps so you don’t hear them go off in the middle of the night which is also good :)
538 2018-12-11 23:04:39 Got CBD oil?
539 2018-12-11 23:04:36 Simple!..first I'll raise your adrenaline then using your 7-year biomedical recyclization studies turn it into serotonin to the level u need and our oil in our flour...
540 2018-12-11 23:04:35 Perhaps they are there to protect their alliance from forces foaming at their mouths to invade for ‘humanitarian’ (oil) reasons as usual.
541 2018-12-11 23:04:19 I would have voted oil slick, really nice
542 2018-12-11 23:04:13 ew why is getting an oil change so expensive

545 2018-12-11 23:03:59 We have to wash our hair more often because it can’t hold the natural oils but it’s unhealthy for your hair to wash it too much so it helps to absorb the oil without washing it.
546 2018-12-11 23:03:56 Senators have voted to send the oil tanker ban legislation, Bill C-48, to committee. By a vote of 58 to 32. Alberta senators @Paulatics,  @PALB2011 and @SenMitchell among the "yeas." #cdnpoli #SenCA

The Alberta Senators should be declared as enemies of Alberta.
547 2018-12-11 23:03:55 Russia is now the biggest stakeholder of Venezuelan oil industry after China and is planning to boost production to a million barrel per day, a big chunk of which will go to Russia. A massive $$ interest to protect by protecting Maduro regime
548 2018-12-11 23:03:41 Extra virgin olive oil with some lemon juice makes an amazing salad dressing. Add some ACV and you lit.

551 2018-12-11 23:03:30 HITTIN HASH OIL OUT OF A CANDLE HOLDER!!!! i want #BongAppétit to come back, this show is fucking amazing @VICELAND
552 2018-12-11 23:03:28 I haven’t even brought up silicone oil yet.  You put dangerous ingredients in your food.  Facts.  Don’t defend your heinous enterprise.  Your food makes people fat and/or sick.  I feel sorry for you, having to defend this garbage food.
553 2018-12-11 23:03:27 Nit sure if you are concerned about oil going up or down from here but lower oil is still a net benefit for US economy (yes, even with large shale producers in US). But to be clear, GS were saying those 3 financial market factors alone will lead to 1% reduction in GDP

555 2018-12-11 23:03:21 Think you'll find that the gas fields in the Southern sector were delivering before the oil, and still are. Lincolnshire didn't do that well, but all in is the rule
556 2018-12-11 23:03:19 Two yrs ago unleaded went to 1.62 a litre when oil was 130 plus a barrel , today oil is 59 a barrel yet unleaded is 1.48 a litre , anybody explain that ?
557 2018-12-11 23:03:18 Id suggest using nail oil on them if you aren’t already! It makes your nails really flexible and resistant to breakage!
558 2018-12-11 23:03:12 They should be cut of all oil imports into Quebec. See how they cope. Maybe they will see the light
559 2018-12-11 23:03:11 I'm eating a salad of endive & hearts of palms w reggiano & oil & balsamic.
560 2018-12-11 23:03:00 He has just called in with some oil for number 10s door locks. Wants to make sure she can vacate the premises for when she gets the boot.
561 2018-12-11 23:03:00 The rise of our Great Nation economically to match and then overtake many of them was due to a number of things. 1. Relaxation of exchange controls (no EU control today). 2. North Sea Oil (no EU control today) 3. Increased productivity through EU competition (SEA)
562 2018-12-11 23:02:58 ありがとうございます
563 2018-12-11 23:02:58 Oh, and it was the cod liver oil that gave you your love of all things maritime.
564 2018-12-11 23:02:57 It’s amazing how much better your vehicle runs when it has oil in it & 2 of your tires are no longer just about flat. (My car holds 5 quarts of oil, i had maybe 1 & a half. Also ran it 7,000 miles more than i was supposed to) i suck
565 2018-12-11 23:02:51 LOL. How about our current government. State sanctioned murder is ok when guns and oil are at stake i guess.
566 2018-12-11 23:02:51 No gas bills, no oil, no brake changes..
567 2018-12-11 23:02:39 But what about the joys of pouring boiling oil over the wall onto your enemies? 
Ah, good times. Medieval times, to be sure, but good ones nonetheless...
568 2018-12-11 23:02:39 If it takes stupidity to get the best economy in 30 years and become an oil exporter....give us more stupid people!

570 2018-12-11 23:02:09 First Law signed by you should be: if the oil price goes down at the Int'l Market, gas prices at the gas stations should lower their prices immediately; the same way they increase prices when it goes up.
571 2018-12-11 23:02:05 Translation:  If you drive a car I want to tax you.  If you eat food brought by truck I want it to be more expensive for you.  If you heat your home with gas or oil I want it to cost you more.

574 2018-12-11 23:01:31 Funny, I hear no talk about how the evil oil companies have somehow become less greedy.
575 2018-12-11 23:01:09 @rdpeng My wife and I are debating purchasing a home and raising a family 4 mi from an oil refinery. Has a minimum safe distance ever been established to avoid a significant increase in risk of developing diseases associated with exposure to the plant’s emissions?
576 2018-12-11 23:01:06 @RachelNotley I'm from Manitoba and would 100% support an Oil Refinery in Alberta. Should've been done 25 years ago! @JustinTrudeau @AndrewScheer 100%!
577 2018-12-11 23:00:56 Best oil for rub downs ?
578 2018-12-11 23:00:53 That mind set is like a death warrant. Who mixes oil with water 
579 2018-12-11 23:00:53 Hello oil money!! We won it 5 times! That’s 5 times more than you lot with half a stadium 
580 2018-12-11 23:00:49 Anyone good oil tycoon investors!
Please give me money!
581 2018-12-11 23:00:43 One of the coolest things about oilfield is that we have all kinds of different people that pick up things from eachother, I was at a store and saw a black and white guy having a conversation in Spanish  God bless the oil field boom 
582 2018-12-11 23:00:43 I’m sorry. Put some peppermint oil on cotton balls and then put them anywhere you see evidence of mice. And/or get a cat. Can give other tips rep poisons and traps if you need them. I grew up in farm country.
583 2018-12-11 23:00:41 Number 2 is Indonesia. All that deforestation due to palm oil isn’t helping. Yet @Greenpeace is supportive of ‘clean’ palm oil. Palm oil repeatedly breaches agreements & continues to deforest - can’t be trusted. We must actually reforest a lot of palm oil as carbon sinks.
584 2018-12-11 23:00:40 My new car isn’t so new anymore. Adam got his first oil change today  why am I so lame for tweeting about this
585 2018-12-11 23:00:38  Good riddens, leave the oil at the door on your way out.
586 2018-12-11 23:00:32 sure, but typically it's to Western countries in the Global North, where oil intake and purchase is brokered through the states - not poor people. so even in that sense, to me imperialism and states could be to blame long before poor or working class people.

590 2018-12-11 23:00:27 The mangroves are being indirectly affected by humans because of their pollution and oil industries which affect aquatic ecosystems. Directly however humans are draining the water from mangroves effectively killing all plants and animals there.
591 2018-12-11 23:00:22 My point was: would not the NDP do the exact same thing, given the opportunity? Except for the “selling back” speculation. 

Assumes the retention of our oil sector.
592 2018-12-11 23:00:12 Ask yourself: how many dems get oil & gas money?

595 2018-12-11 22:59:56 Fossil Fuels promoters are paid very well.  I hope public ridicule of them accelerates.  I'm afraid major TV networks are closely tied to Oil Corporations.
596 2018-12-11 22:59:43 Green New Deal is the answer--change us over to sustainable energy & production AND re-train people to do these jobs. They're smart enough and they can feel good about their employment not wrecking the planet. Coal and oil money is EASY that's the only reason we still do it.
597 2018-12-11 22:59:43 So oil is like $50 a barrel? Fuck it I’m gonna start buying oil barrels
598 2018-12-11 22:59:37 おはようございます。

Everywhere you go things aren't so swell
Fingers sticky, I can tell
Corruption stench is what I smell
Millions missing? Now oil. Oh hell!
When will this quell?
Its time to repel
To account, you must be compelled
Its time for the cat to bell...
602 2018-12-11 22:59:22 Nutty evangelist preachers are nothing more than snake oil salesmen  selling religion to the gullible. Historically, power has always used the churches/religion to keep the masses submissive.
603 2018-12-11 22:59:19 Nahh Ian ate no in a while, I bought some beard oil 
604 2018-12-11 22:59:10 Just not tap water, and it should be bottled in glass not oil based plastic. 
605 2018-12-11 22:59:10 If he was any more fragile, Faberge would make an egg in his honour. Remember the days whn journalists were like Earnest Hemmingway during the Spanish Civil War?
The closest Owen cld come wld be to fry up a Spanish omelette.
Even then he'd probably go to A&E for oil spatter burns
606 2018-12-11 22:59:02 My hair really loves coconut oil. No cap. I use it for everything. From pre-pooing to the LOC method, or even as a quick refresher. Naomi really loves coconut oil.
607 2018-12-11 22:58:50 Perhaps this will be on his menu at one of his plant based eateries? Most of these are riddle with highly oxidative veg oils. He also places canola oil over butter. #agenda, #sellout,#kahnartist
608 2018-12-11 22:58:46 Yes, let’s deal direct with Alberta . Canadian oil, for Canadians .  Cut off the blood oil now.
609 2018-12-11 22:58:42 At UN climate summit the U.S. deleg.held an event promoting use of fossil fuels to fight against Climate Chg.Branded ‘laughable’ by critics, the news comes after the US allied w/other oil states to stop a key scientific rpt influencing proceedings at the COP24 event in Poland.
610 2018-12-11 22:58:31 Things that smell truly divine, an incomplete list
- tomato stems
- the smell of rain on soil (petrichor)
- onion being fried in oil
- fresh vanilla
611 2018-12-11 22:58:27 U should be a snake oil salesperson u bought and paid for PHONY LIAR
612 2018-12-11 22:58:14 Coffee
Sugar
Cocoa
Cotton
Hops
Palm Oil
Banana
Jute
Coconut

All crops which have little or no subsistence value but command high commodity prices. That is what unidirectional trade creates. Coffee is not a luxury in Spain, Italy, Greece where it forms a core of daily routine.
613 2018-12-11 22:58:14 I am not in the oil business. But I live in an oil city. And all of my business decisions are based on recessions and booms.
614 2018-12-11 22:58:09 need this cbd oil if i’m a work riiiight
615 2018-12-11 22:58:03 Coconut oil n sugar 
616 2018-12-11 22:58:02 I'm not sure of the point you're making. Those look like pragmatic and sensible policies we should take part in.

Still, unbelievably, no leave plan. Not even one proposed by Rees Mogg. He had to remove it coz noone could agree.

These are the people we should trust?

625 2018-12-11 22:57:05 yeah it's weird because oil prices now days aren't really controlled by the administration. But Trump sure does take credit for it.
626 2018-12-11 22:57:05 I’m looking for the next best BEARD wash...my main source is mountaineer brand. I tried some beard oil and balm, just not sure if I’m doing it right. #beards #beard #balm #shampoo

630 2018-12-11 22:56:13 No price response on huge API is a clue that this never has been about supply & demand but rather using oil to try to save a economy that is rolling over while still talking tough at the Fed.
631 2018-12-11 22:56:11 lol we aint been on nothing cause i've never paid for a oil change  he was just telling me and i was like makes sense lol and now he do mine and i see what he putting in lol
632 2018-12-11 22:56:11 UL Washington was running to the corner store for some toothpicks soaked in cinnamon oil.
633 2018-12-11 22:56:07 Russia wants to drill for oil there
634 2018-12-11 22:56:05 Lou Dobbs!?! It is really comical who you quote as allies and sycophants. They're snake oil salesmen, just like you.
635 2018-12-11 22:56:04 Executives does not mean CEO's - it means anyone in the management structure. There is one Chief Executive Officer in a company, and many executives. As there are ~400000 people working in oil in Texas, that probably means around 20-40,000 executives, and maybe 100/200 CEO's.
636 2018-12-11 22:56:01 Juan not Baked Jessie, common, ha

637 2018-12-11 22:55:59 My first exposure to a Quantum Capacitor was in 1988 by a 92 year old scientist. He developed it in the late 20's & used it for levitation. Then his lab was burned to the ground. Oil Co's watched him. In 1988 the schematic he gave me was stolen from my home. Weird?
638 2018-12-11 22:55:54 By ya man beard oil for Christmas. And if he don’t have a beard, then check his ID cause he probably 15
639 2018-12-11 22:55:52 tuberculosis? I got an oil for that babygirl 
640 2018-12-11 22:55:49 People might say, look at Dean Heller in Nevada. He supported the GF and lost.

But that misses the bigger picture. Even though his party is owned by the Oil Industry, Dean Heller had no other choice but support the GF and thereby support extension of the EV tax credit.
641 2018-12-11 22:55:45 Actually we do but it kinda screwed up. We sell the states pur crude thier 11 Refineries in the south. They process it and send it back up. We buy something like 70% from the state most of which is our own crude oil refined backed to us.

643 2018-12-11 22:55:43 All the products made with palm oil from trees planted in once Orangutan homes not worth the life of one
644 2018-12-11 22:55:30 I thought it was almost like an oil painting of a freaky virgin Mary 
645 2018-12-11 22:55:28 why? because decent countries do not care about Trump sanctioned on Iran.  In fact, they think he was manipulated by MBS and Putin to increase Saudi Arabia and Russia greater oil output when Iran is decreasing their global oil.
646 2018-12-11 22:55:22 *Lightly oiled.

Too much oil and things get dirty real fast.
647 2018-12-11 22:55:17 This is like when I found out that weightlifting doesn't make you shiny, and that they use this thing called "oil". :^)
648 2018-12-11 22:55:11 I've been in uyo akwa ibom since march, PH is my axis, nothing more significant in the oil producing state. Go to calabar, imo and the likes.. I can see this is not about fact but about politics because you're obviously giving me pdp states.
649 2018-12-11 22:55:09 Who said it had to be all one industry?  The point of diversification is to have many industries so you're not reliant on just one, because when that one tanks, people suffer. You can have multiple industries that earn more combined than just oil.
650 2018-12-11 22:55:07 Perhaps rather than sending them cash why not barder our oil to Quebec
651 2018-12-11 22:55:00 We go cook you with  anointing oil

653 2018-12-11 22:54:49 I just underestimated tea tree oil. #oil #beautyhurts #cantdoit
654 2018-12-11 22:54:30 Can't wait to hear from Alberta politicians, how pumping more oil will somehow raise the price.

It's like they skipped page 1 in their economic textbook, clearly saying if you increase supply, price will drop.   #pnpcbc #ableg #cdnpoli
655 2018-12-11 22:54:26 Update- got my oil changed at Walmart after a two and a half hour wait
656 2018-12-11 22:54:24 Yeah I sat there just emptying whatever was in there, I normally always have de icer but I guess the place I got my oil changed put some stuff in it it was like straight soap covered and iced over lmao

659 2018-12-11 22:54:06 Vaseline Lotion. Fast Absorbing... I also use the Cool mixed with Pears baby oil... but i applying normal powder on my face before leaving the house, which after feel hours would have disappeared
660 2018-12-11 22:53:59 @LukeGromen Very little movement on oil price after Massive API draw shows evidence that this take down was orchestrated to try to save a dying economy & still save face at the Federal Reserve. The longer this little game goes on the greater foundation for a serious oil rally.
661 2018-12-11 22:53:55 Bullish oil
662 2018-12-11 22:53:55 Anyone else remember when gas prices were low during the Obama Administration all you heard about on the news was how cheap oil was bad for the economy?? Where’s that at now lol
663 2018-12-11 22:53:48 Something that always confuses me on this point though: a lot of those companies are oil companies making most of their profit from selling gas to consumers, no?
664 2018-12-11 22:53:42 Hey God I have a question, why does the oil accumulate at the top of my hair, where i dont need it, and not the bottom of my hair, where i do need it?
665 2018-12-11 22:53:40 Do you believe what you write? Quebec is crystal clear that Alberta and the oil can f right off and die, and you want to continue to play paddy cake with them? 

I think you just knee jerk react to “UCP Baaaaaad” like a good little sheep.
666 2018-12-11 22:53:39 Sarah must have asked "a lot of people" at Jiffy Lube while getting her oil changed.

670 2018-12-11 22:53:15 Bro... Walmart pokes ass to do an oil change. I should of done it myself...
671 2018-12-11 22:53:04 West Coast Env. Law should read the BC Oil and Gas Commission news release, because the article by The Tyee is absolutely false !
672 2018-12-11 22:52:58 Please do not keep repeating S&P is salt & pepper, evoo is extra virgin olive oil. The show needs to slow down. Guests don't have time to speak. Show makes me dizzy. Slow it down. I'm not gonna get bored and change the channel.

683 2018-12-11 22:52:13 Snake oil salesmen disgust me.

685 2018-12-11 22:52:07 That is exactly how to do it. @Zebrafishspoony you can get through this. Then tonight hop online investigate better pain relief. Ketamine transfusions? Maybe CBD Oil? Perhaps even benzos. England has more accessible pain relief than many places - I hope something works for you.

687 2018-12-11 22:52:00 The responsibility for scandalous wastage and losses at Petrojam properly resides at each level - from the MD thru the Minister to the PM. But the ultimate question of responsibility is: why does the government (and therefore the taxpayers) own an oil refinery in the first place?
688 2018-12-11 22:51:48 Oh god, yesterday when I saw this all I could think of was he needs those old oil wipes from Mary Kay. But then I thought, oh that's mean. Glad to see it wasn't.

691 2018-12-11 22:51:23 terribly embarrassing.  People laugh at things they don't understand.  Try living without oil.

697 2018-12-11 22:51:06 I also cannot get over the madness of opening new oil wells in the age of climate change. Think this was a sign that U.K. had lost all sensibility before Brexit.
698 2018-12-11 22:50:57 at Walmart waiting for my oil to get changed n it’s like an hour wait so i walked around n bought snacks and came back to share them w the other strangers waiting & nobody wants any :-))))

709 2018-12-11 22:49:25 Nice journalism, @WSJ. Your article on ND's oil production surpassing Venezuela's is full of inaccuracies and is written in an insulting voice.

1. September oil production was 1.36 million barrels per day, not month. This is much different than the caption in your article.

722 2018-12-11 22:48:27 Brett likes to suggest things like “Canada buys their oil from Saudi Arabia”. Not true. The government does not buy oil, the oil companies do...they are the ones you need to go after.
723 2018-12-11 22:48:18 This is part of current Elite operation to crash economy, blame Trump and install Central Bank Crypto.

729 2018-12-11 22:47:45 How much power do you use? How much oil do you utilize? I suggest you go oil free in January 2019 and see how long you can survive in northern Alberta

737 2018-12-11 22:47:05 Quick tip, in the winter you should keep your gas tank at no lower than  half and have your oil changed on time because the temperature can stall a cars start up!
738 2018-12-11 22:47:04 I don’t drink pop or bottled water.  I think the water tastes like oil.  I use a Zero water filter.

749 2018-12-11 22:45:51 Oreos said they're removing palm oil & sourcing better while they transition.
750 2018-12-11 22:45:12 I thought it would be cool to get a new car... now I have a car payment every month and my oil changes went from $25 to $50 
751 2018-12-11 22:45:11 If you want to argue legitimately, stop lying. No one has EVER said democrats want an open border except Trump, because he failed to get Mexico to pay for the wall, and has now created a crisis to save face.

755 2018-12-11 22:45:03 Going on 2 fucking hours for an oil change. Why do I keep coming here
756 2018-12-11 22:45:00 "implement dry-land farming practices"

You want farmers to grow more food with less water because you are a coward who is unwilling to confront oil companies or to act on climate change.

Just grow food without water is what Cory Gardner says. Can't make this shit up.
757 2018-12-11 22:44:59 I love the moral obligation line, when Quebec imports oil from Venezuela.  Run that one past me again Gary. Did I miss the part where Venezuela is a part of the go- green movement? Or shoukd we in Canada pay twice. Paying carbon tax here  buying from those without one?
758 2018-12-11 22:44:51 Imagine  the green infrastructure that could have been devised with the trillions we spent in the middle east for oil.
759 2018-12-11 22:44:43 We (or in this case, the USA) pay for cheap fuel. Oil spills happen, they always will as long as we rely on fossil fuels. Clean up operations btw are still ongoing, they havent stopped, but that is not widely recognised. Fines are crippling for non compliance
760 2018-12-11 22:44:40 You drank oil? That explains a lot :P (jk)

766 2018-12-11 22:43:42 Latest figures of direct contribution peg it at 11%. This excludes secondary and tertiary industries because of overlap.  Stephen Harper has some good points regarding the value of oil gas buoying the Canadian economy during the financial crisis. Keep an open mind and read it.

777 2018-12-11 22:42:40 Brent Oil Spot had a big drop and last 2 weeks been wiggling about sort of sideways. This could be a 'Ledge' before more falls and $57 key support. Done 50/200 day MA death cross which although not super reliable can mean falls ahead.

779 2018-12-11 22:42:17 .When I worked as a natural resource professioinal, the bonds the oil and gas companies had to put up were far to small to actual reclaim the site. The level of default is high. We are going to have a sediment and invasive veg disaster. Same for coal mines.

784 2018-12-11 22:41:57 Funny when you don't even watch TV and someone brings up Fox news as an insult. Typical. Hugo Chavez was a Socialist and no one denies that having government control of oil was a reason for it's collapse. Government control = socialism.

787 2018-12-11 22:41:34 The articles are old because of the moratorium on drilling in PQ. This would literally do nothing to Alberta's oil market, much like the Utica and Marcellus plays in the US don't impact the AB market. Gas market is already full, so potential dip in gas prices but not much.

I’ll give you a hint. It’s not Greenpeace or WWF.

804 2018-12-11 22:39:50 Btw, the kind with the oil? Sometimes the oil gets really hot and burns their little kitteh tongues.
805 2018-12-11 22:39:50 We've got a leadership that's partnered with Russia and Saudi Arabia to burn oil, so there's an added powerlessness there that is unappealing

This is even in UAE where they're one of the highest oil producing countries.  

This means they're getting ready for this.

825 2018-12-11 22:37:27 The Saudi's are established murderers.  Now they are murdering the planet.  But to be honest, it's our fault for insisting on driving gas-guzzling cars and giving them power over our oil obsession.  We need to change our habits, and then they won't matter.

827 2018-12-11 22:37:13 oil strong and looks to be heading north....should be a solid day tomorrow for all O&G stocks....#BOIL #SDX #TXP #GKP #RDB #UPL #ADL #ANGS
828 2018-12-11 22:37:12 Lack of transparency?the major oil contracts have been made public. The NRF is not an "initial proposal'  but a bill now before parliament. It establishes three committees to oversee the fund and no revenues can be withdrawn without the approval of the Parliament.
829 2018-12-11 22:37:07 I am a robot. I piss oil
830 2018-12-11 22:37:03 Y’all gotta understand that we’re in a triangle right now , chinese wants our oil , we want their technology and Saudi’s want to combine .. whoever wins can lead to a dominant power
831 2018-12-11 22:36:38 In an indy Scotland, with all our resources at our disposal, agriculture, fishing, renewables, oil & gas, plenty water, hospitality, tourism. What would we want2import from Ruk that we couldn’t produce here? And with that in mind, who would have upperhand in negotiations? #yes2
832 2018-12-11 22:36:35 Seriously fake news even @RachelNotley acknowledges the countless layoffs in Alberta Athabasca Oil Corp layed off 25% of staff today #Shame on you for not acknowledging all of the Albertans without jobs
833 2018-12-11 22:36:35 my sister quit her job at an oil and gas company and is now working for a local brewery and i feel like this is going to be a problem for me and boys chat

835 2018-12-11 22:36:19 Sturgeon only has the capacity to process 79,000 barrels a day. With the Oil Sands and insitu producing 2.8 million barrels a day we need approx 35 more. Who has that kind of money? Around 250 billion dollars at 4 years of construction each and 5000 workers per plant.
836 2018-12-11 22:36:16 @JustinTrudeau @cafreeland 
As a citizen of Canada, I call on the Prime Minister to go further & condemn specifically the actions of SA’s Crown Prince MBS,  human rights violations in SA & the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. BAN Saudi oil! END arms sales! REDEEM yourself after Cuba
837 2018-12-11 22:36:12 My phone won't connect to any blue tooth devices, my computer crashed twice today, my FB messed up ... my apple TV is no longer working.... and my Jeep is telling me I need an oil change.  I think I simply need a vacation and R&R LOL
838 2018-12-11 22:35:56 you make your fan base look shit ! i feel sorry for them the real ones that were there before oil and blood money came in not the ones that swap shirts for glory !
839 2018-12-11 22:35:53 @FoxNews @greggutfeld on @TheFive, I understand the most dangerous job is the deep sea oil pipeline welders. Have you ever wondered why there are so few females in dangerous jobs. And Juan almost stepped on a rake on his fact moment. LOL
840 2018-12-11 22:35:50 Can't argue with this, though OPEC and to a lesser extent GECF manipulation of oil and gas prices, the refugee crisis and general European stagnant are also to blame.
841 2018-12-11 22:35:24 Umm.... we import a large portion of oil needs from Saudi Arabia instead of developing it here...
The same Saudi Arabia that stones women to death and throws homosexuals off buildings... 
Your logic is lacking...
842 2018-12-11 22:35:15 it's just oil and sesame seeds, unless you have something more exotic in mind.
843 2018-12-11 22:35:09 They get the lions share of about $20 billion every year. Alberta basically funds Quebec's share,  and they have the nerve to say we have no social license in Quebec for oil? While bringing in oil from Saudi!?
844 2018-12-11 22:35:02 Lol i can tell you don't get oil changes

846 2018-12-11 22:34:50 Hard to believe we are talking about promoting dirty oil or oil at all while in Poland we are hearing that we need to shut down oil production and invest in clean energy. #pnpcbc
847 2018-12-11 22:34:48 Indeed - that's the plan - go totally green - no more shitty oil, coal and natural devastation... Not yet there... Need to go faster ... Never ever any new pipeline!

For CONVENTIONAL oil and gas a western refinery might be a good idea. For tar sands product that would be throwing ( lots of) good money after bad.
854 2018-12-11 22:34:27 Sorry S. Have u tried fish oil? Good for the hair
855 2018-12-11 22:34:15 You have my permission to pour chain oil all over the first person who calls it man flu.
856 2018-12-11 22:34:09 It's funny how Quebec has no problem taking revenues from Alberta's "dirty" oil.
857 2018-12-11 22:34:08 On 8 November 2018 the Apache Corp. founder, Mr Raymond Plank, died at the age of 96. Before Apache he was selling interests in drilling oil wells. He founded Apache in 1945 to raise investor funds for oil & gas drilling. Hi became an Oil Tycoon.
858 2018-12-11 22:34:03 With the oil cutbacks that Alberta will institute, I wish we could target the cutbacks, deliberately starving the refineries in Quebec and BC. It's time they understood what life without hydrocarbons looks like.
859 2018-12-11 22:33:53 @PabloGilTrader Hola Pablo, muy buenas tardes. ¿Qué te parece la siguiente idea a L/P?: A nivel mundial, el m° de vehículos está cambiando paulatinamente pasando del uso del petróleo a la electricidad -> disminuye la Dda OIL -> disminuye P. de Petróleo?
860 2018-12-11 22:33:49 They make electric planes yet or na? Or do we just stop all flights tommorow to protect our environment? Go back to mud huts? Or just use saudi oil shipped via ocean in electric boats?
861 2018-12-11 22:33:41 good morning sa mga chicken oil na hinaluan ng vetsin ang ininom ni daniele na napunta din sakin.

863 2018-12-11 22:33:06 That's harsh. After all Arese-in-oil is doing very well in the minor league (Europa).
864 2018-12-11 22:33:03 Biggest snake oil con man that ever was.
865 2018-12-11 22:32:56 As devastating as it is, Oreos are made with palm oil and I can’t be dealing with that poor orangutan advert running through my head 
866 2018-12-11 22:32:54 Also, take a large mug, put in 1/2 cup oats, handful each of raisins and walnuts, glug of olive oil, and large spoonful of peanut butter. Stir and microwave till warm and gooey. Stir in a handful of dark chocolate chips. OMG. It’s so good!
867 2018-12-11 22:32:48 Im too lazy to change my oil

877 2018-12-11 22:32:18 They're just sending a message to show people what happens when you try to put all the "energy eggs" into the "electricity basket"! What floors me is how many people think that electricity prices will drop if gas and oil are gone. Special kind of stupid!

879 2018-12-11 22:32:07 Um... that’s your argument for how Trump is responsible for the ten year trend in rising oil production? About what I expected. You can crow about your feelings about Trump all you want, but don’t back claims you have no facts for.
880 2018-12-11 22:32:01 Still need a fucking oil change 
881 2018-12-11 22:31:46 We have a big problem with chemicals dumped in our water ways. Also, the oil spill from deepwater horizon, they claimed it b.c was cleaned up. No, they paid people off. We go to the gulf 3 times a year. The water is still full of Tar balls. But, that was under Obama
882 2018-12-11 22:31:33 My go to lazy chicken breast is tossed in olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Seasoned up, lots of garlic and finished with dried rosemary. Toss that shit right up on that George Foreman and call it a night.

893 2018-12-11 22:30:53 To top it off, we need 35 more in order to process 2.8 million barrels a day that the Oil Sands produce. Sturgeon only processes 79,000 barrels a day. Who has that kind of money?
894 2018-12-11 22:30:48 Get some peppermint oil (not the flavor stuff from the grocery store) put several drops on a cloth on the floor of your shower. Take hot shower. Or if you take baths: 10 drops. More is not better.

898 2018-12-11 22:30:32 They want us to pay for the damage they have created while they suck every drop of mother earths much needed resources to keep the plane-t operating.

900 2018-12-11 22:30:13 Yes nothing has changed in 14 years...
The US was still a net oil importer, so we could sell all the oil we could to them. Now they are a net exporter, and we are looking for new markets, and the province that is holding that up also takes EQ from that very revenue.

906 2018-12-11 22:29:47 Those sanctions are against the mafia that kidnapped the country and has 20 years stealing the Venezuelan riches, specially the millions of dollars the US has paid them for our oil, and to prevent they keep stealing even more.
907 2018-12-11 22:29:38 Now that is ridiculous. You are suggesting resistance to fracking is based on laziness and you are suggesting all that oil and gas under our feet would be worth enough to the NS gov to end transfers. Good night.
908 2018-12-11 22:29:36 Lime
Another essential oil known to lift depression is Lime.
Create a synergy with Bergamot for a blend that's even more effective.
Combine with Peppermint to relieve fatigue and start your day with a little lift. Great to use in the car when driving long distances.

912 2018-12-11 22:28:57 I’m actually beginning to believe that big oil and GOP know for a fact humans have caused the ice melts in the Arctic. How convenient as they are all  in on oil drilling now that the ice is gone. We need a world tribunal to hold these criminals accountable.
913 2018-12-11 22:28:56 Wow look all that oil!! You killing me!!
914 2018-12-11 22:28:55 Man boobs, a gut and combs his hair back with motor oil.

916 2018-12-11 22:28:46 I love coming home. My mom fed me delicious food, my dad took my car to get an oil change, he filled up my gas tank and washed it 
917 2018-12-11 22:28:43 Feds can encourage investment in research. The free market should lead the way on this. Oil subsidies definitely have to go.
918 2018-12-11 22:28:23 The "government", specifically the Trudeau government, intentionally makes western Canadian oil economically unavailable in eastern Canada.

But you knew that and your tweet is malevolent dickery.
919 2018-12-11 22:28:22 Vote & Retweet: If the Quebec government keeps opposing pipelines carrying Alberta oil, do you favour a boycott of Quebec products?
920 2018-12-11 22:28:12 There is Rex... and Mob Rex.
But on American soil the real Dark Oil Rex is David Koch. This guy must be taken down. He's trying to kill American Democracy. He doesn't mind giving the country away to Putin and Xi. He just wants more power. In this case citizens must be Goliath.

922 2018-12-11 22:28:03 Anyone seen the movie There will be blood? I grew up working in the oil field. My father still works in the field. We know all to well the corruption that surrounds black gold. They want to claim Global Warning yet they are not willing to stop using petroleum products.

927 2018-12-11 22:27:19 Look around! America is doing great. America turned into a net oil exporter last week, breaking almost 75 years of continued dependence on foreign oil. That’s huge. Obama killed that with EO and regulations. Unemployment, lowest ever. Obama killed businesses. Did you bitch about
928 2018-12-11 22:27:12 my face is an oil slick
929 2018-12-11 22:27:09 Oil is thicker than blood.

933 2018-12-11 22:26:54 Have you tried Omega-3 oil?  It has health benefits as well, which is nice, but makes my picky pup want to devour his dinner most of the time!
934 2018-12-11 22:26:53 People have said that the food coloring in Mountain Dew is a carcinogen, lie lie lie, its the Vegetable Oil.
935 2018-12-11 22:26:47 So I guess you know more than all the oil companies that shutdown or reduced production during the recession. They really need to hire you.
936 2018-12-11 22:26:44 Why do we like borrowing? We create problems 4 ourselves when there's none, the price of crude oil is above our benchmark, so where is the excess going too?
937 2018-12-11 22:26:36 Yes I old enough to remember News Commentaries asking with all the oil and gas we have why do we rely on Foreign Gov.,  @realDonaldTrump was asking same thing!  GUESS #TRUMP FIXED IT!
938 2018-12-11 22:26:29 @davidshukmanbbc what is the empirical evidence @realDonaldTrump and the #Saudi oil barons are using to counter the @UN science about the reasons for and impact of #climatechange ?

946 2018-12-11 22:26:04 Reuters- Pemex's very expected onshore farmouts postponed for six months. Oil regulator CNH also formally cancelled Feb. auctions, which would include 46 oil and gas blocks
947 2018-12-11 22:26:03 My Dad who died young, 61 worked for Trump as a Glazier. After 20 years on the Fire Dept he dumps his pension into this shop. Trump "stiffed" him. My Dad was famous for his top notch work. Trump always was a snake oil salesman. We knew it here in NY
948 2018-12-11 22:25:47 Did he put the chicken on an oil change receipt??
949 2018-12-11 22:25:37 Not bitching it works both ways mostly!  I’ve worked in Alberta as well! But there are a lot of Alberta workers in Sask mainly because Albertan oil companies bought out sask owners!
950 2018-12-11 22:25:35 i love spoiling myself, lighting some candles, put a mask, moisten my hair with my favorite oil, relax, and enjoy the moment
951 2018-12-11 22:25:20 We know where the oil money goes to (well after Aliyev and his clan have helped themselves to billions of dollars ), the rest goes on anti -Armenian propaganda. Many corrupt academics, journalists, politicians, diplomats, lawyers etc etc are paid by Aliyev to spread filthy lies!

957 2018-12-11 22:24:41 Fried food isn’t really even cooking to me. It’s easy to just throw some seasoning in oil. But actually boiling water, cuttin chipping things, timers, measurements, etc. That to me is more effort and cooking for a person.
958 2018-12-11 22:24:26 Raising taxes on trade is not “progress”. Signing deals that perpetuate tariffs and restrict trade is not “progress”. Closing off markets to American made goods and services is not “progress”. Raising costs for oil & gas, automakers, etc. is not “progress”.
959 2018-12-11 22:24:21 It comes off with oil or makeup wipes
960 2018-12-11 22:24:21 It's Not a scientific concensus. There are tens of thousands of scientists, and not in the oil and gas fields - that have signed a petition *against* the idea that man is causing this.

962 2018-12-11 22:23:56 200k of that was returned, total from Execs was about 35k. So they don't know that he accepted any cash from Oil Execs at all actually.
963 2018-12-11 22:23:54 Americans transformed shithole Venezuela into a rich and prosperous country until the Cuban trained Russian puppet Socialist Chavez took over all American investments there. Corrupt criminals aren't seeking help for the people, Russia is protecting the regime in exchange for oil
964 2018-12-11 22:23:47 "Most people are too busy surviving to know how powerful Standard Oil is" was I'm sure something said in 1880. Things change.
But it's worth paying attention to the inorganic structures that ushered in this Amazon conundrum (Amazon's antitrust paradox, in fact).

967 2018-12-11 22:23:40 Our focus on visual arts was on perspective today. Students in both classes were given the task to imagine they were on the ground, looking up at a snowman. They were then asked to draw what they would see. Students used oil pastels to complete their creations.
968 2018-12-11 22:23:38 Need that Arab oil money I’m afraid.
969 2018-12-11 22:23:03 No one is going to invest 40 billion for a new refinery with global demand for oil declining in the next decade. If someone actually said I am going to build one, it would be over a decade before it will be online.
970 2018-12-11 22:22:55 Lmaooo. . I just know. Cause yo ass don’t even know when to get a damn oil change 
971 2018-12-11 22:22:52 Well there were those times the US bombed innocent civilians by the tens of thousands for oil right up to last week.   Does that count?
972 2018-12-11 22:22:35 Awww, poor baby. 
Do you want a massage with lots of oil?
973 2018-12-11 22:22:23 If only sunny it were that easy.  You missed the part about food shortages, corruption, inflation, and the collapse of nationalized oil industry (noted), agricultural operations, transportation, power generation (hydroelectric), telecommunications, steel production, and banks.
974 2018-12-11 22:22:17 @ChinaEmbOttawa I’ll let you have unrestricted flow of Alberta oil. Just tell Mr Trudeau to get the pipelines built ASAP.
975 2018-12-11 22:22:05 Don’t fret! Just check him before he comes all the way in the house. And you can put some tea tree oil in his hair to help keep them away I believe!

979 2018-12-11 22:21:38 This article is from two years ago but it couldn't be more accurate and worth-reading. 

Putin and Trump gang are the oil gang. Their reckless behaviour towards environment would, if they were to be enough time in power, transform our planet into a Mad Max scenario.
980 2018-12-11 22:21:37 Bots against a future for humans must be big oil.
981 2018-12-11 22:21:23 Please do not CC the Horse Man. And for the record you're changing the issue. Some of the people who donated to Beto were CEOs of oil/gas companies, not gas station workers. Beto has spoken in support of natural gas. Let's not mix this up too much.
982 2018-12-11 22:21:18 You're assertion is trash. Renewables are already cheaper than fossil fuels per unit of energy. Cheaper than coal, natural gas and oil derivatives. The only remaining challenge is the capital cost and time to transition. Less than the cost of one Petro war.
983 2018-12-11 22:21:18 Oil vey is very apropos.
984 2018-12-11 22:21:11 So, still in my mad Christmas phase, I've made some pickles. Currently have all the incense and oil burners I own burning to get rid of the smell of vinegar
985 2018-12-11 22:21:11 sounds good mr pence … can you respond to accusations that pence oil left empty fuel tanks (hazardous waste) at company fuel stations when they were closed ? states pd for the cleanup
986 2018-12-11 22:21:08 Iran was legal under Obama until Trump put Iran on sanction because  Putin and MBS want to manipulate oil price.  Thus, is this a big deal  compare to Trump election fraud or his family criminal business  enterprise?
987 2018-12-11 22:21:08 You might be surprised but I support alternative energy. I'm not sold on global warming  (I've seen compelling arguments to the contrary) but why not error to the side of caution. And if for nothing else it would relieve our need for oil from people that hate us.
988 2018-12-11 22:21:05 Haber haber. Estos medio cruza de peronchos con zurdos¿tienen el 80 % de la industria vitivinicola?. De acuerdo a ello el Estado deberia intervenir y obligarlos a desinvertir. Ej. Standar Oil en EEUU. Y la Conti habla de corporaciones y monopolios?
989 2018-12-11 22:21:05 But effects of past mistakes done by Russia still running behind.
But Russia Stopped it.
But USA still continues for their power on Oil Etc.,
But Russia also should talk to France President for to do neccesary steps in favour of public or else New Rebels will come out like Syria.

What would happen to Jamaica if oil is found offshore?

I bet one could make one’s own ranch flavored ones by tossing them with oil and powdered ranch dressing. (Hmmm. Gonna have to try that.)

999 2018-12-11 22:19:30 Sure, so the country imports oil from places like Russia or Saudi Arabia. It exports oil to places like the EU. When the exports exceed the imports. The country becomes a Net exporter.
1000 2018-12-11 22:19:25 Damn sis. I know a friend of mine with oily skin used witch hazel as a toner after she washed her face, and then almond oil (which is lighter than coconut oil) as her moisturizer.

Still though why do I have to TREAT my fridge
1003 2018-12-11 22:19:18 If the MSM and Democrats show excitement about a candidate, that candidate is for the corporations and oligarchy, not the working class people.  Beto is a corporate Democrat who is funded by big oil.  #NeverBeto

Yoga or running while fasted in the morning then lifting at night 5 days a week.

I am on day 5 of using 6 drops of cbd oil right before bed. What I've noticed is sleeping better and way less soreness.
1032 2018-12-11 22:16:12 If i ever have a daughter im gonna teach her how beautiful she is. How important and privaleged. She is to be black. How her nappy hair is a gift not a burden. How her skin is rich as oil. Because no one else ever will.

1035 2018-12-11 22:15:32 I'd prefer humans focus on the ACTUAL problem... then and their actions. 

Y'all literally killing off members of another species to try and avoid actually fixing the real problem.

Focusing on plastic straws while fracking the whole Earth for oil. Same shit only w\ dead animals

Pour in the reamining 1/4 teaspoon of peopermint extract
1041 2018-12-11 22:15:00 Trump is using immigration, caravans and walls as tools to stir up his dwindling base. It's nothing than a crook trying to sell snake oil. Waste of money from the "fiscal conservatives". When our debt is paid off you can think about a wall!

1053 2018-12-11 22:13:49 I think the health of our children is a litmus test to the health of our society overall. The children are so confused, so sad.  We need to step up and pay attention and, yes, DO something! If there is a wrong, make it right!

 why am I even an adult?
1081 2018-12-11 22:11:16 It's not as simple as just build it and they will come. don't you think oil companies would have built a refinery in Alberta if they saw a huge profit margin. They don't cause of the reasons I listed above.

1086 2018-12-11 22:10:53 I remember this quote from a school excursion to Moreton Island (former whaling station) when I was a kid and I regularly think about it 

“We used to kill whales to get cooking oil from their blubber. Then they realised you could get oil from vegetables” 
1087 2018-12-11 22:10:53 First you want a break for the oil sector & when you get it you complain. Typical Andy, wants it both ways.
1088 2018-12-11 22:10:37 Girl just put coconut oil in it! It last longer and helps when it’s dry !
1089 2018-12-11 22:10:36 I saw. They look great.

I sometimes wonder if my painting ever actually improved or if Nuln Oil just got invented and started doing the hard work for me.
1090 2018-12-11 22:10:17 I do/put olive oil with veggies and stir and fry for a while then add very hot water
1091 2018-12-11 22:10:16 I think we can get Pallone's seat in 2020. They've turned his state into a dumping ground for the oil industry and what does he do? Complains about bureaucracy? He needs to be primaried!

1093 2018-12-11 22:09:57 @Tesco what are you doing to address palm oil in your products?
1094 2018-12-11 22:09:55 So proud of my mom @adpruner on her appointment to Plains All American Pipeline's board and everything she's done to blaze the path for female executives in oil & gas 
1095 2018-12-11 22:09:55 Oil is so #Passé, how about a #wind or #solar farm? Join the #climate_change #Global_agenda and start planning for the #future of your #children? #COP24 #Trudeau #Liberals_in2019
1096 2018-12-11 22:09:53 You hear about our latest oil field discovery?  Between Texas and New Mexico.  It’s the largest one we’ve found yet, dwarfing the previous.  Now Texas alone has more oil than all of Saudi Arabia.
1097 2018-12-11 22:09:37 cause refineries are expensive, and the refineries Alberta has, were way over budget and needed public dollars to be finished. 

Plus our refineries would need to compete with US facilities that are already built and paid off, which lowers the cost to companies sending oil to US
1098 2018-12-11 22:09:36 Quebec vetoes the eastern route, BC the western.  Trudeau knows how to block oil and kill projects.  Unite the country?  Not so much.
1099 2018-12-11 22:09:15 Seeing as another common trope is “Russian hackers”, I can totally see whole tribes of deviated peace-seeking oil rigs, floating to the safety of Arctic waters only to find battle droids there
1100 2018-12-11 22:09:12 Really don't understand why we pay light bill gaskiya when all the time thinking of buying gen fuel and engine oil to service it again
1101 2018-12-11 22:09:05 But also in general because my hair’s oil status is pretty gnarly rn
1102 2018-12-11 22:08:44 i found a recipe from someone's comic! you mix a teaspoon of miso, sesame oil, and mirin, brush it on top of a riceball, and bake it for 20 mintues
1103 2018-12-11 22:08:20 Do you expect Congress to stand up to the Saudis? Money and oil/weapons lobbies have always proven far more important to Capitol Hill than human rights.
1104 2018-12-11 22:08:16 As far as the oil industry imploding? can’t see it in my lifetime. Just don’t think it’s going to grow much more than it is now relative to the looming #climatecrisis 40% of the GHG emissions in Cda are pumped out of AB so that kinda puts you guys on the hot seat. 
1105 2018-12-11 22:08:11 This is FUD from Kochsucking disinformation groups. Only an oil company would tell these lies.
1106 2018-12-11 22:08:08 @DylanDreyerNBC roasted Brussels sprouts 375 for 45-60 minutes... toss with olive oil and seasoning before
1107 2018-12-11 22:08:06 Huh?  I thought if you buy oil from terrorists supporting countries it doesn't contain carbon?  Isn't that why we shut down our oil fields, to save the environment by importing carbon free terrorist oil?
1108 2018-12-11 22:08:02 I’m sure I saw him at EP dressed as a gimp, being led on a dog chain by man wearing a thong and baby oil. Sorry, my mistake. 
He has a twin, right?
1109 2018-12-11 22:07:52 Exactly what they've done for years to people who own land where privately owned oil pipelines went through.
If the owners protested they were arrested.
Some of those land owners held the property rights for generations
1110 2018-12-11 22:07:50 Our youths now prefer formication to marriage. That's wokeness

1112 2018-12-11 22:07:36 Try being liberal while working for an oil and gas company and see how repressed, censored, or threatened you end up. 

Rather than assume that companies are split similar to politics in general, it is all about the industry.

1121 2018-12-11 22:06:56 Most of Beto’s $ came from CEO’s & the rest avg $200 & under. If you think Beto will do anything ab climate change you’re sadly mistaken. CEO’s wouldn’t have donated to him if they knew Beto wasn’t pro gas & oil. Beto said choosing between gas/ oil & renewables is a false choice.

1127 2018-12-11 22:06:39 I was hit by a car when I was younger, and have had a lot of surgeries in my leg. What CBD oil would you recommend for chronic pain, I've tried a few different types, and the gummies but it doesn't work like everyone says it does for them. Could you give me any advice please
1128 2018-12-11 22:06:20 Of COURSE not

Aren't the big oil companies exempt from carbon taxing here because politicians are afraid they'll up root and [somehow] take the offshore oil reserves with them (???)
1129 2018-12-11 22:06:14 おはようございます(*^^*)
1130 2018-12-11 22:06:08 They were a pain in the ass for many oil companies
1131 2018-12-11 22:06:07 Listening to a male professor teach about feminism is like listening to a horse trying to explain how the mechanics of a deep-sea oil rig work.
1132 2018-12-11 22:06:04 LMAO. When you enter Mayflower I was probably still sucking my mother's breasts. And please don't let the Ikorodu people on this app come for you. Lol
1133 2018-12-11 22:06:03 Do people in other industries experience such woeful levels of competence from politicians? Do oil people hold their heads in their hands when a member of congress asks a question of the CEO of Exxon?
1134 2018-12-11 22:06:01 Sunflower black bread salmon sandwich, sauteed mushrooms with virgin oil, and an improvised german chef salad, lol. Yummy!

He ballooned our deficit in his first year and has no plan to change that path or reduce it in any way. Also GND will create jobs that those in the oil&coal industry can occupy

1154 2018-12-11 22:04:04 It's days like this where I'm getting an oil change, purchasing sensible work shoes & eating a 1.99 salad from QFC that means I'm entering a gateway into middleagedom with faint rage in the distance that will explode with yelling at some poor sap during pre-menopause, you know?
1155 2018-12-11 22:03:59 Compromise got us the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and 90% of what the oil companies wanted.

Have you tried it?
1160 2018-12-11 22:03:15 Just a friendly PSA that you still need to scrub and wash a cast iron skillet, not just boil water in it, dump it out and dry it. Hot water, scrub, salt, vegetable oil, and a stove. It’s not hard.

1163 2018-12-11 22:03:01 PC in power had no bearing on oil prices being so high. They continuously sold our most important asset for short term gain with no eye to the future, THEY are the reason we are in trouble now.We should be major players in the global oil market in the year 2018, not pawns.

1170 2018-12-11 22:02:20 Everyone in Cda pays taxes, not just ABns. It’s a shame your many years of Conservative govts gave up so much in royalties and taxes from oil companies. You guys could be filthy rich now (like Norway). NDP has done a good job for you though and that’s hopeful. 
1171 2018-12-11 22:02:15 Ill get my oil change at the dealer but everything else I’ll go elsewhere
1172 2018-12-11 22:02:12 I make a conscious decision to avoid palm oil or make sure it is sustainable.  I make no apology for that.

I don't think though that you are somehow not vegan for eating food with it in.

Generally we should avoid processed food anyway, but that is easier said than done
1173 2018-12-11 22:02:03 Can't understand why any country has anything to do with this lot of Devils?....Oh wait It must be something to do with all that filthy Oil!
1174 2018-12-11 22:02:00 We don't even use our own oil, we buy Saudi oil.

So maybe we become energy independent first. Then worry about exporting after.

1215 2018-12-11 21:59:06 Kevin, we are NOT "addicted" to oil & gas, we are DEPENDENT upon them for our very existence! We litterally EAT OIL! For every 1 calory of food we eat, we burn 10 calories of OIL & POPULATION GROWTH increases that! We have NOTHING that can replace those fossil RESOURCES.

1217 2018-12-11 21:58:55 When is the US gonna be sanctioned for Iraq? Israel for Palestine? that's the double standard I pointed out. Do you even listen to yourself? I suggest you fact check your nonsensical claims before posting. Saudi Arabia is the biggest oil exported worldwide.
1218 2018-12-11 21:58:43 ない・・・だ・・・と・・・
1219 2018-12-11 21:58:41 Can bio oil be used as a substitute for massage oil ?
1220 2018-12-11 21:58:36 That’s a lot of oil.
1221 2018-12-11 21:58:30 Hear me up, you toast some bread,  pour over them some sunflower oil and add salt.
1222 2018-12-11 21:58:26 I heard @bertkreischer wants to wrestle you in a tub of baby oil
1223 2018-12-11 21:58:22 morning routine:
1. wash face with essential oil acne face wash: coconut tea tree olive (Keeva)
2. apply tea tree oil acne serum (Keeva)
3. apply acne medication from dermatologist (onexton)
4. use emuaidMAX on any dried out spots
1224 2018-12-11 21:58:21 And 'land' here would include oil. George also thinks that this can be accomplished via tax policy and democratically; Marx focuses on the need for a violent over throw of the system. Historically, Georgist ideas have produced more robust economies than Marx, genearally speaking
1225 2018-12-11 21:58:21 My throat still feels so dry upin the water. Do I drink oil now?
1226 2018-12-11 21:58:16 was just in the posh pet store to buy cat CBD oil & an intoxicated man came in all wound up & told the cashier there was a conspiracy in which a UT student was murdered by (i think) either the city or university police in some sort of cop power struggle ??? how’s your day goin
1227 2018-12-11 21:58:15 The Premier has clued in before the UCP and the old time conservatives who wanted no part of refining! She is showing more leadership on the “oil” file than we have seen in at least the last 20 year by conservatives!
1228 2018-12-11 21:58:00 You should actually see a doctor maybe it’s contagious.
It might infect your other hand. Oh dear. Darling get some cannabis oil. I believe you can get it on prescription now on the NHS
1229 2018-12-11 21:57:58 Bet. Is there a certain price range you think you find the best quality oil at
1230 2018-12-11 21:57:57 I have a rose quartz one and I use it after I put face oil on. It feels very cool and soothing and I like it so far, though I'm not noticing any drastic changes.
1231 2018-12-11 21:57:51 Can I vegetable oil at specs?
1232 2018-12-11 21:57:24 God bless rosehip oil! #Delicious
1233 2018-12-11 21:57:24 And of course sanctions on #russia have started at the time russia attacked Crimea before attack there were no sanctions and still russia is selling more crude oil than any country on the planet
1234 2018-12-11 21:57:03 We we're never depending other Countries for oil. The goal is to exhaust the worlds reserve leaving ours for us.
1235 2018-12-11 21:57:01 Dont be sorry, apotek? Hell no,  those rat bastards sold me  "lice treatment",  328 crowns  for 2x  uses for each of us.?  Looked at the ingredients? Mineral oil and perfume  WTF Sent old man for two bottles babyoil, for all of 58 crowns. Smmfh. I miss a good bar of lye soap.
1236 2018-12-11 21:56:30 well if you think about it, they reproduce a lot more often than humans. Fish and chicken lay eggs so in just one month that could be A LOT of offspring lol. You got me on the oil though, idk about all that lol
1237 2018-12-11 21:56:28 And what can we do now? What is there to lose by investing in renewable energy?  Lowering the output of greenhouse gases? Less profits for oil companies?  You’re believing a guy who can’t put together a coherent sentence over the majority of world scientists.
1238 2018-12-11 21:56:19 I’m watching this poor lady get taken for a RIDE at the oil change spot. She just saying yes to everything. I feel so bad for her.
1239 2018-12-11 21:56:15 There may not be a "right type"! We've seen high PM2.5 levels from experiments we've conducted using oil, too.
1240 2018-12-11 21:55:59 sana oil :(( anw congrats shewe!!
1241 2018-12-11 21:55:56 and yet we buy Saudi oil
1242 2018-12-11 21:55:56 **COP24 UPDATE #1**
- Many more political heavyweights have arrived this week
- Saudi Arabia, Russia, USA (top 3 oil producers), and Kuwait insist recent @IPCC_CH report is "noted" rather than "welcomed" by COP 
- Greta Thunberg continues to speak wisdom beyond her years
1243 2018-12-11 21:55:39 Read the invoice for my oil change and got light headed
1244 2018-12-11 21:55:36 Does your definition of “our own” include oil friendly politicians who want to let fossil fuel companies make the earth uninhabitable for my children and grandchildren?
1245 2018-12-11 21:55:08 Why are oil changes so expensive 
1246 2018-12-11 21:54:58 ตั้งแต่รู้ข่าวคราว ฉันก็ไม่เคยสุขใจอีกเลยย มีแต่ความรู้สึกผิดเต็มอก
1247 2018-12-11 21:54:49 Lol some oil

1249 2018-12-11 21:54:45 Stop killing Muslims around the World in the name of freedom !!!!!!

Stop killing Muslims for Oil fields , Minerals or raw resources  !!!!!
1250 2018-12-11 21:54:35 It's insane, how one journalist changed the game. What's sad from consumer perspective, if oil is moving up and probably sharply then it's really painful for economy.
1251 2018-12-11 21:54:35 Ms. Notely, can you share the moment you realized your lifelong fight against pipelines and the oil industry was wrong? What made you turn your back on your dedication to ruining Alberta’s energy sector? Was it an incident, sudden clarity or creeping realization? Feel dumb now?

1255 2018-12-11 21:54:23 とても、苦しそうです、、
1256 2018-12-11 21:54:16 Just got showered in used engine oil and fuel. Love my job 
1257 2018-12-11 21:54:16 Oil seed rape for you townies
1258 2018-12-11 21:54:14 おめでとうございますb
1259 2018-12-11 21:54:13 Your right .....to tell you the truth I would love to see a new fuel source invented  so we can kick all the oil rich Middle East countries back into the desert living in tents and shagging camels like they were 50 years ago
1260 2018-12-11 21:54:10 Hahahhahahaha maxa easy,  ka bi dan shégen a hankali 
1261 2018-12-11 21:54:09 People have been saying that for 40 years. Other countries have done it. If oil companies and those who get rich from it would stfu and stop paying off politicians so they can keep gouging the public, it would be doable. More corporate bullshit.
1262 2018-12-11 21:54:06 How dare you make my BetoStan look bad sir. I'm more upset about that journalism process than my Betostan getting some sweet oil $$$. Totally won't affect his politics. duh
1263 2018-12-11 21:53:58 Yeah you're actually not the first one talking about tea tree oil and it makes me want to do it even more. I'll definitely give it a shot
1264 2018-12-11 21:53:47 It's basically about how pollution ravages the earth and the people responsible (oil companies with their spills, deforestation for cattle herding by fast food coys etc) build a STAR ARK and runaway
1265 2018-12-11 21:53:47 Thinking of surprising my besties with an oil painting of their dog that passed about a year ago for Christmas.
1266 2018-12-11 21:53:40 Really? Last week where one of the major Sander's surrogates tried to shade Beto by implying he took corporate money from the oil and gas industry only to be called out that it was money from people who worked in fossil fuel industries and in Texas that is nearly everyone?
1267 2018-12-11 21:53:38 I’m in Lucas Oil talking big SHIT on Sunday

1269 2018-12-11 21:53:28 Thanks for linking this, I just need to find a way to like oily fish.
I've never eaten mackerel or sardines, I like the taste of salmon but a bit out of my price range.
But there's alot that I like included in there.
Not sure about olives/oil lol
1270 2018-12-11 21:53:27 Sadly my chihuahuas nails looked like this! I hunted everywhere. They weren't where they were supposed to be by his furmator. I swear I looked high and low. Found them in my med scooter basket with my tanning oil, earbuds and his blanket I set down for him and water bowl. Winter!
1271 2018-12-11 21:53:25 That's exactly what I mean. West Wing has dulled the policy imagination of liberals. Obama was a west wing dream but still bailed out wall street, made huge boosts in oil production in the face of environmental catastrophe, and droned the middle east left and right.
1272 2018-12-11 21:53:21 Melt the Arctic, steal the oil. #ExxonKnew #PutinsPuppets #KochsPlanAllAlong #climatechange
1273 2018-12-11 21:53:18 I wish I had answers for you. And I wish I had solutions. The only thing I can advise is CBD Hemp Oil to control the pain. It will limit it, which will be better than nothing. DM me so I can tell you more 
1274 2018-12-11 21:53:09 suddenly I’m going to become a one woman show and invest in some tea tree oil
1275 2018-12-11 21:53:01 でも髑髏かいたらスケスケにしたところ潰れそうなんだよなあ
1276 2018-12-11 21:52:50 Oil is used in the creation of about 144 different products, including plastic. Try going without it.
1277 2018-12-11 21:52:50 Who will be blamed if the Saudis start buying weapons from Russia or China; if oil prices skyrocket; it causes a collapse of peace. I agree with you most of the time but this is a situation we should wait and see all the facts. Then extradite the guilty to us to prosecute.
1278 2018-12-11 21:52:49 And one of the biggest oil producers around the world 
1279 2018-12-11 21:52:35 I'm not in anyway supporting the act, neither can I dispute their claims from what I heard in the video and her reactions, there's definitely a situation.
Well fornication caused all these, na them sabi
1280 2018-12-11 21:52:28 今更感がすごいんだけどサマのシャツに髑髏かけばよかったなっていう若干の後悔
1281 2018-12-11 21:52:26 Am I lightweight or CBD oil is wild

1284 2018-12-11 21:52:20 I’m home busy day at work and got my oil changed in my  car I’m ready to relax
1285 2018-12-11 21:51:45 You don’t need Quebec’s “approval” to build a pipeline to Churchill, MB, a shipping station in Hudson Bay, and ship oil by boat through the Hudson Straight (int’l waters).
1286 2018-12-11 21:51:34 I gave your video a watch but I'm not interested in the pandering of an oil propagandist. Please take your archaic ideologies with you and hope that future generations can clean up the mess you've left us. I'll take NASA, NOAA, IPCC, Royal Society, etc. any day over Steve Goreham
1287 2018-12-11 21:51:30 Trudeau is trying to do both: save jobs, taxes, royalties in oil,gas sector, and do something to protect environment.West Coast tanker moratorium, 4example, which FirstNations groups r contesting in court. Its real world politics, not campaign rhetoric
1288 2018-12-11 21:51:26 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. Yet they are starving due to their socialism. BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America

1290 2018-12-11 21:51:18 Do not weep for the Earth.
It will be here long after you.
Holding you in warm embrace.
Squeezing you into oil.
1291 2018-12-11 21:51:12 Here a thought. Gradually get rid of petrol guzzlers, replace with petrol/electric hybrids doing 1.6litres a 100k. Irrigate central oz and grow bio fuels. Reduce oil imports, become fuel independant. Govt subsidised rather than RE. Better result for us and huge $ saved personally
1292 2018-12-11 21:50:59 That is 100% racists Cohn is a disgrace

1298 2018-12-11 21:50:33 I wonder what Ralph thinks about Oil & Gas situation in AB and to some extent SK?
1299 2018-12-11 21:50:27 All of a sudden she cares now?! Is this a last stitch effort to get the voters back on her side after putting thousands out of work in the oil industry?! Seems fishy

1310 2018-12-11 21:49:15 If you know the name and employer, you could get a list of executives at the company or you could just look at the person's LinkedIn. And in any case, Beto said that choosing between oil and renewable energy was a "false choice". Ok for Texas, disqualifying as a Dem nominee.

can help you? 
Comment 'ADD ME' to be added to my FB Group 
1315 2018-12-11 21:48:22 I wash my face first obviously, then I use a tea tree toner from Lush and then I apply the oil in the areas where my pores are clogged (after a while it gets less and less!!) and eventually on spots and when it dries I use aloe vera and then my moisturiser

1319 2018-12-11 21:47:55 Send them to Plymouth, they would appreciate  the income and jobs! 
And we could equip them to guard our north sea oil, which we will happily sell you back, although not sure we'll want paying in your new national currency!
1320 2018-12-11 21:47:49 Exactly... like if oil production goes down because we keep it in the ground, who exactly pays the cost when gas prices rise as a result?
1321 2018-12-11 21:47:46 That is only a conclusion on impacts of the spill because so few have happe Ed, which makes pipelines the safest option for transportation of oil products.
1322 2018-12-11 21:47:33 before the farm was sold i would smoke 10grams with hash,oil,wax by myself.

1325 2018-12-11 21:47:13 Castor oil, Red raspberry leaf tea, pineapple juice,nipple stimulation.lmfao don’t ask me how the last one works but I guess it does.
1326 2018-12-11 21:47:04 4 years ago when the recession was well on its way and Oil prices were rock bottom? You think that would have been smart?
1327 2018-12-11 21:47:04 Personally?  Not much anymore.

If I make burgers I'll use it to get a nice crisp when I toast the buns on the pan, and sometimes I'll use butter instead of oil when cooking.
1328 2018-12-11 21:46:58 Maris piper... rice bran oil 
1329 2018-12-11 21:46:54 No doubt, the 35% decline in the price of oil penalized a major, analytical failure about the future growth rate of oil demand. But that may not be enough. It looks to me like the error about oil's future is quite widespread and embedded. $OIH $XLE
1330 2018-12-11 21:46:54 Maybe a little something like a nice beard oil or moisturiser (If either of them has one) or a nice smelly. A cologne. #WexfordHour

1334 2018-12-11 21:46:02 Exactly. Mist of these people will be using oil in tablet or ointment form. Not smoking it.
1335 2018-12-11 21:45:52 Google Amla oil for beard growth
1336 2018-12-11 21:45:40 Am i wrong If i think you are sjw's.

1345 2018-12-11 21:45:07 Worked with oil! Oh, wait.
1346 2018-12-11 21:44:55 どちらにせよ剥き出しの指は死ぬことには変わりないんだけど
1347 2018-12-11 21:44:54 Lol nothing wrong at all, drill and rig fine. Oil strike imo. Bring it on.
1348 2018-12-11 21:44:37 Wow! Our waterways are clearly too clean! No need to be pristine! Let’s muddy them up a bit with arsenic, acid, maybe a bit of oil...ya know, like the good old days!! Make Our Water Great Again! MOWGA!!
1349 2018-12-11 21:44:34 Take this with a very large grain of salt after last week's big miss, but the API is forecasting a huge -10.2 MMbbl crude #oil inventory drawdown for 12/1-12/7, 6 MMbbls bullish vs 5 yr avg & the 2nd largest draw on record for the period. It would be the largest draw since July.
1350 2018-12-11 21:44:31 Yeah I get it. For you, an internet meme or your feelings are right, but the actual government published data is wrong lol. (Ps. Guess where the data on oil you are cheering today comes from? Yeah. The very same sources you say are bogus)
1351 2018-12-11 21:44:28 Yay! Coincides with the exporting of oil.. again!
1352 2018-12-11 21:44:17 The girl fuck up big time
1353 2018-12-11 21:44:15 Perhaps then, as we begin to transition, a good start would be to support Canadian oil rather than foreign. We are all aware of the oppression, abuse, lack of regulation, gender inequality etc that exists with foreign oil.
1354 2018-12-11 21:44:13 I think it is too early to judge all quebecers, this premier is a novice and he should be advised, in my view Alberta should stop paying oil revenue taxes to the federal Government until they build the pipeline.

1357 2018-12-11 21:44:04 I grew up in Ellesmere Port.  Olive oil was something you put in your ears, spaghetti bolognese was exotic.
1358 2018-12-11 21:44:04 Omg I have both I had no idea. Do you apply the oil first and then aloe Vera? How long?
1359 2018-12-11 21:44:03 You and I are like oil and water
We've been trying, trying, trying
To mix it up
1360 2018-12-11 21:43:57 #oilprices  Will global oil prices continue to deflate in 2019? Yes. Why: OPEC-Russia deal to cut 1.2 million bpd will be offset by forecast US shale rise from 10.88 to 12.06 bpd; oil demand falls as Europe, Japan, EME recessions deepen in 2019; and OPEC & Russia cheat on deal.
1361 2018-12-11 21:43:50 You are a girl and know what girls can do, on God back in secondary school, a new comer girl stole 2k in my class, hid it in her vagina, a female Yoruba teacher took her to the toilet n they got it out.
We later knew stealing was d reason fr her former school expulsion.

1369 2018-12-11 21:42:47 Honestly it took a while for me to see results with the aloe, but the coconut oil started showing results much faster.
1370 2018-12-11 21:42:32 It's never made sense (or cents!) to send Alberta oil to the US only to import more oil from over seas.  It has cost Canadians money and jobs.

1377 2018-12-11 21:41:59 A lot has changed since then. Oil was $120 a barrel. It’s $10 now.  The cost of living has increased. It’s tougher to get a mortgage. All I know is billions have dollars have left this country. We are losing $80 million a day on Oil production. Different times, different actions.

1397 2018-12-11 21:40:03 I encourage vegans to educate others on why we should all TRY to avoid palm oil. But I agree, there is an absolute way to go about it, some things are so expensive that it hurts to even think about spending that kind of money on perishable items.

1426 2018-12-11 21:36:34 Right. I'm writing an ebook series on this right now. Main idea: markets work at the margin. It's not about how much oil, in absolute terms, on-road EVs displace. It's about how much EV growth can disrupt the oil demand growth path, by taking charge of the new market share.

1431 2018-12-11 21:36:01 ha ha...!  Yes, you just put some flour, salt & pepper on them, and fry them.  We use olive oil,  simple!  there are other recipes I am sure, but we always just fry them like that.  It's somewhat of a treat because we only eat them in the winter.

1492 2018-12-11 21:29:53 right time to wash my hair n get this oil out n fingers crossed it feels better
1493 2018-12-11 21:29:48 Yes 

Denver promoter has me shacked up at a log cabin in the Mountains at 10,000 feet with some CBD oil, a dog and several portable oxygen tanks for when I get dizzy. 

These are the exact experiences I was looking for when deciding to DJ. 

Couldn’t be happier right now. 
1494 2018-12-11 21:29:44 Kevin, we are NOT "addicted" to FF, we are now TOTALLY DEPENDENT on them for our very lives! Without these fossil RESOURCES, only about 500 MILLION of us could be FED. After oil, if we survive climate heating, there might be 500 million of us left.
1495 2018-12-11 21:29:19 Waiting for my oil change to be done, making plans to pick up a gingerbread house kit on the way home 
1496 2018-12-11 21:29:09 You mean like ensuring term dependance on saudi oil? Endlessly pumping raw sewage into the St Lawrence is such an environmental triumph too
1497 2018-12-11 21:29:00 Lamb rubbed in mustard, olive oil, garlic, and oregano. So flavorful and a perfect red wine match! #PantryChat
1498 2018-12-11 21:28:45 Gaskia the marriage is illogical and inappropriate. Although its not rape, neither is it a sin but certainly not encouraged in Islam.
1499 2018-12-11 21:28:40 Literally have a juul pod with oil in it that I can’t smoke cause I don’t smoke a faggot ass juul
1500 2018-12-11 21:28:37 Yeah, let's not start that discussion.
Scotland more than pays its way, and the entire UK economy and financial sector has been underwriten by the value of Scottish oil since the 70s.
Have you read the McCrone report?
1501 2018-12-11 21:28:32 I’ve just had an Epsom & Dead Sea salt bath, sugar scrubbed myself, dyed my hair, done a mud mask, vit C face treatment, neck to toe in body butter, & an anti ageing face oil.

I still look knackered, haggard & like a dried up husk. Winter, tiredness & 40s are shite 
1502 2018-12-11 21:28:23 Yes but ...
We really really should stop burning oil when we don’t have to
We could have more EVs in our fleet right now
1503 2018-12-11 21:28:22 The #EIA forecasts an average 2018 #WTI price of $65.18 a barrel, down 2.4% from the November report's forecast. It also cut its 2019 view by 16.4% to $54.19. #oil
1504 2018-12-11 21:28:16 "I picked up my doohickey and it says people disagree with me! Tell siri up there in that cloud that that's just not how we do things in the good ol' US of A"  

how is selling oil globally different from selling advertising globally? #Favoritism
1505 2018-12-11 21:27:50 Try tea tree oil orrrr maybe ur face is dry even if it is oily u should still moisturize also ily and ur so pretty acne ain’t shit
1506 2018-12-11 21:27:44 Don’t go to the Erin Mills location. They don’t want to work.
1507 2018-12-11 21:27:32 So what your saying CEO’s aren’t allowed to individually donate to a candidate because they’re rich? Or he’s not allowed to accept it cause they’re work within the oil industry? He said he wouldn’t take any pac money and he didn’t. I’m failing to see the problem.
1508 2018-12-11 21:27:31 Crude oil is permitted to be shipped everywhere in Canada. Why are First Nations communities and traditional territories being subjugated to a punitive and arbitrary legislative regime?
1509 2018-12-11 21:27:16 I normally would agree.  Not sure right now.  We have few allies in that region.  Saudi Arabia is one of the few.  Can't trust rest....except Israel.   Are you willing to destroy our relationship with them?  Our #1 supplier of oil.  Obama sent $500 Billion to Iran to destroy them
1510 2018-12-11 21:27:05 Lmao
1511 2018-12-11 21:26:56 Psalms 45:7  Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
1512 2018-12-11 21:26:55 Yes as i scalp oil a lot. My ES trades are usually quick to get the 80% off, obviously the trailing position i leave takes longer but in general i am a scalper
1513 2018-12-11 21:26:48 Well if Quebec wasn't in love with foreign oil, i am sure it would be piped there from Alberta. Funny how oil barged 6000 milles away from "patriarchial", cultures passes the "ethical" tests. Alberta will sell it abroad because it scarcely has any other options.
1514 2018-12-11 21:26:43 Varför då De kör inte bil menar de då eller hur menar de. iofs så vill ju helst inte Big oil och Fossilbiltilverkarna inte Byta till Klimatsmartare Drivmedel

1516 2018-12-11 21:26:17 Maybe monopoly-man should show up for hearings with broadband companies, oil giants, defense conglomerates, chemical companies... all of which are much worse for society, for much longer, than Google. But MM is a republican, probably...
1517 2018-12-11 21:25:59 exactly!! i get really oily around my nose and upper lip for whatever reason and oil cleansing is the only thing that gets rid of it
1518 2018-12-11 21:25:50 No, no, no. Pre-made popcorn sucks. Get 8 qt pan w/ tight lid. Cover bottom w/ 1/8" grape seed oil, one layer of popcorn. Cover, high heat, walk away. That whole shaking thing: bogus. Come back when it's almost silent. Take out organic ghee, Himalayan salt, mix.
1519 2018-12-11 21:25:43 3u geleden heb ik mijn haar letterlijk laten verdrinken in castor oil
1520 2018-12-11 21:25:32 hmm I haven't seen you post anything about the massive oil and gas subsidies being a problem... 
1521 2018-12-11 21:25:32 Does this include canabis oil or just the building material?
1522 2018-12-11 21:25:28 Damn. Convincing myself not to buy an oil diffuser but they look so cool 
1523 2018-12-11 21:25:26 DIY BRUSH CLEANER 
-1 cup natural dish soap
-1/2 cup olive oil 
-3-4 drops of essential oil 

DIY MAKEUP REMOVER 
-1/2 cup melted coconut oil
-1/2 cup baby shampoo 
-1/4 cup distilled water 

DIY BODY EXFOLIATOR 
-1 cup sugar 
-1/2 cup olive oil
1524 2018-12-11 21:25:15 They’re thick and I think made in coconut oil. So they’re good but not the same as when you buy the more authentic ones

1528 2018-12-11 21:24:45 S/N: 13963, you?

Oya hit me with your BU/UT.
I am at the CHQ
1529 2018-12-11 21:24:35 Exactly. Time’s Person of the Year is chosen based on who/what the biggest, most controversial story of the year was. Not necessarily about who was the “best” or who did the most good. I believe Putin, Bolsanero, MBS, and Kim Yung Un were all candidates, which should say somethin
1530 2018-12-11 21:24:33 Yep. Funny though, isn't it, that the AstroTurf @peoplesvote_uk is being run and funded by Blairites like @campbellclaret who completely ignored the people's will to start his oil massacre in Iraq..
1531 2018-12-11 21:24:24 Niggas Be Thinking They Slick But Baby I’m Like OIL  Let’s Not Play THOSE Games, IDC IDC
1532 2018-12-11 21:24:08 Brow scaped and he’s coconut oil free
1533 2018-12-11 21:24:05 Tx. We doing a contango in oil study using CSOs next. #Uconn and prof Bob Biolsi.
1534 2018-12-11 21:23:42 When do we see your feminist gender analysis of Saudi Oil you allow entering our country instead of Alberta oil going East. #LiberalHypocrite #cdnpoli
1535 2018-12-11 21:23:38 EZ shares +1.3%
US shares flat, but were +1.4% then -0.6% thru the day with noise around trade and Dec 21 gov shutdown risk
US 10 yr yld +2bp to 2.88%
Oil +1.4%, gold -0.1%, iron ore +0.2%
ASX futures +0.3%
$A 0.72 as $US index +0.2%
1536 2018-12-11 21:23:35 This is funny... Alberta would still have to get the oil to market...there would be duties put on it to flow thru any other part of Canada I would think...not so easy to seperate and still be able to ship product...
1537 2018-12-11 21:23:23 ★★★★★
"Great service! 

Called for an appointment yesterday afternoon and went in first thing this morning for an estimate on an oil leak. 

IDd the problem and took care of it right away.

1538 2018-12-11 21:23:20 Oil is a great alternative for those of us that don't have scissors for hands.
1539 2018-12-11 21:23:18 Love the oil paintings.
1540 2018-12-11 21:23:16 Everyone is talking about who the REAL #KingofR&B is. Y'all don't make me cover my body with baby oil and put on an unbuttoned dress shirt and show y'all who the real King is  #90sR&Bvibes
1541 2018-12-11 21:23:12 How about Barry O!! Didn't he make is the#1 oil producing nation in the world?  Make him "person of the year."
1542 2018-12-11 21:23:09 @TheoFleury14 let’s start a boycott of Quebec products until they support energy east. They accept Alberta oil money and at the same time deny the oil itself
1543 2018-12-11 21:23:05 GUH those commercials of people washing animals from oil spills are so good in a sensory way
1544 2018-12-11 21:23:00 IM HAVING THE WORST DAY i got summoned to court over a car accident that happened in July 2017, my wisdom tooth is coming down and has swollen my glands and given me an earache, and then my engine overheated and I'd to spend half of the money I have on coolant and oil
1545 2018-12-11 21:22:59 Coat it lightly in olive oil and salt, toss it in the oven until crispy, great snack. Any other way, bitter disappointment. #ObligatoryRelationshipJokeGoesHere
1546 2018-12-11 21:22:51 So you think tweeting a random factoid with no analysis/explanation is good reporting? A million trolls jumped in with disinformation that the money came from office workers and hourly employees who just happen to work for oil companies. It made @davidsirota look like a hack.
1547 2018-12-11 21:22:36 Coconut oil has been my go to for years now...... the small of sex in the 70s because tanning oil
1548 2018-12-11 21:22:19 Less coconut oil?
1549 2018-12-11 21:22:07 why would I be scared of someone knocking on my door, I'm not a gutless cowardly conservative afraid of everything.......
please, TRY to make sense . Oh, can you ask "Q" if I can buy an exploding pen or sports car with oil that shoots out when you see him?
1550 2018-12-11 21:22:01 I have migraines probably 3 times a week. But I’ve been rubbing peppermint oil on the undersides of my wrist and my temples. It works wonders for me. Maybe it’ll help you!
1551 2018-12-11 21:21:53 WOW, a " space Agency"? Another " agency " for USA Dominance , Militarily of SPACE. Snake Oil, Downer , Gerchuii. SPACE " Kadets"
1552 2018-12-11 21:21:37 I’m applying as his model prep person, or whatever the rub-oil-on-muscles person is called.
1553 2018-12-11 21:21:22 Anxiety is caused by overthinking. No oil or drug will fully work. You just have to start thinking different and renewing your mind.
1554 2018-12-11 21:21:20 Scotland is a resource and skills rich country. We are better placed to be successful that other already successful small countries, and we can do this without oil and gas.
It is likely that  Scotland will be a member of EFTA or the EU and that has helped protect Ireland.
1555 2018-12-11 21:21:18 There is.  You can also buy CBD oil at pet stores to calm your pet down.
1556 2018-12-11 21:21:15 5Billion? Okay. NOW GET MY 1.5 TRILLION BACK! I WANT MY MONEY BACK NOW! NOT YESTERDAY NOT TOMORROW_ RIGHT THE F NOW! KILL TAX BREAKS FOR OIL COMPANIES! KILL TAX BREAKS FOR WALL STREET. GET MY TAX MONEY BACK. I DONT WANNA CUT- I WANT MY MONEY BACK!
1557 2018-12-11 21:21:09 that’s a good solution given all the other constrains. Why send more oil to gulf refineries when you can refine more yourself & sell gasoline, etc to the rest of the country?
1558 2018-12-11 21:21:01 1:20 #DELTABC Reports of an oil spill on the #BCHWY99 southbound offramp to #BCHWY17 eastbound. Extremely slick for the offramp curve, use caution!
1559 2018-12-11 21:20:56 I'm told CBD oil will help with my concussion pains . Any recommendations?
1560 2018-12-11 21:20:51 Well you go and live without anything that has anything to do with oil. Then I will change my mind.
1561 2018-12-11 21:20:41 Down to less than a 1/4 tank of heating oil, and the company refuses to deliver more until my bill is paid off in full. Can't afford to do it before I run out. Now facing the possibility of freezing to death in my own damn house, and before Christmas, no less! Life sucks!!!
1562 2018-12-11 21:20:29 Same expression used at my waste-water treatment plants.

You claim 2 contradictory things: (1) the majority (not 100%) of oil & gas workers value their pay more than the environment, & (2) there are no tree huggers in oil & gas.

Bottom line; some people in oil&gas support Beto.
1563 2018-12-11 21:20:24 Also quite funny that @campbellclaret now claims to have discovered the 'People's Vote' after ignoring a million-and-a-half of them to start the oil massacre in Iraq, the profits from which he's funding @peoplesvote_uk with...
1564 2018-12-11 21:20:20 I think Sirota is being misleading. Where are the specifics? His claims on this were pretty well debunked a week ago. Very disappointed in Sirota. I'm on the ground in Texas, he's not.
1565 2018-12-11 21:20:16 Explain the availability of jobs? The increase in Steele production, oil industry, coal export?
1566 2018-12-11 21:20:09 I heard black seed oil is poppin I wonder if I should try it
1567 2018-12-11 21:20:09 Im sporting the mineral oil look, thanks to my spawn, who brought home critters from preschool... Ugh 51 years bug free, not once, Oh no... Not now ffs, id shave it bald but then some cockthistle would swear im appropriating Mr Clean's image or some shit lol
1568 2018-12-11 21:20:08 Cualquiera que lea esto y piense que somos borregos Illuminati, que encuentre cuántos estudios hay de "glyphosate" y cuántos de "Neem oil" o "spinosad". Ojalá todos los pesticidas estuvieran tan caracterizados como el #glifosato.
1569 2018-12-11 21:19:43 Cool—is this where the announcement regarding tariffs on oil coming to to Canada will be announced? #cdnpoli #oilprices #energyeast #tmx #KeystoneXL #ableg #abpoli

1571 2018-12-11 21:19:34 backing oil and gas makes Labour as un-sensible as the Tories. Your choice.
1572 2018-12-11 21:19:25 Why does winter have to disrespect my coconut oil like this?

I just want to use it and go

No more of this warm it up/melt it first business

1575 2018-12-11 21:19:02 Right, makes no sense you can extract oil from paint but you can't make bullets into other bullets
1576 2018-12-11 21:18:57 Sounds great. Can we include your hydro power into the equalization formula like a Western Oil is?

No!? Thought so.
1577 2018-12-11 21:18:52 My oil change was a hunnit dollas today  I was $29.99 oil change like other folks
1578 2018-12-11 21:18:42 +Not to mention none of this relies on capitalism, all of what they label prosperity and progress can be laid that the feet of oil and the cheap energy it provided. Of course cheap is a relative term because the real bill is is coming due.
1579 2018-12-11 21:18:41 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
1580 2018-12-11 21:18:31 So i understand the environment needs to be protected. Have we as Canadians decided that we are not going to sell our oil ? I didnt vote for that.
1581 2018-12-11 21:18:29 I oiled my self so much rn that my thighs look like unga ya chapati when the oil touches it..... wow I’m a lil thick eh.
1582 2018-12-11 21:18:26 وانت بكره بتصرين مثل صفاتهم
1583 2018-12-11 21:18:21 Hemp is related to hops. Not surprising that a beverage can be made from the hemp plant. Not sure that CBD oil is made from the plant or from the seed.
1584 2018-12-11 21:18:21 I thought a man of your stature would know that the Trudeau government does not buy a drop of oil from anybody. Certainly you weren’t playing politics...or were you????
1585 2018-12-11 21:18:21 لاحول ولا قوة الا بالله العلي العظيم.... طبيعي النداء ترى، الظاهر عندك مشكله مع المسلمين؟؟
ولا الاخ ايش ديانته؟؟؟؟؟؟؟؟
1586 2018-12-11 21:18:07 Why because Albertians are a bunch of self serving greedy bastards who expect the who country to cater to them and their oil but when the rest of the country is in need they put their fingers in their ears? Why should anyone in the country care what Alberta wants?
1587 2018-12-11 21:17:50 On the real though, does castor oil actually work ?
1588 2018-12-11 21:17:38 Love too dip my corn pizza in crude oil
1589 2018-12-11 21:17:32 The zoo isn't kidding I remember that first dab 
I have COPD can't do it much. But when my pain over comes my edibles I do a dab of oil & get instant relief
1590 2018-12-11 21:17:26 I do that too! I have a popcorn maker, or use oil in a pan with herbs & spices... I buy white kernels in bulk with my own container, pre-weighed (so you don't pay for your container every time), then you just have to wash & reuse the container... #zerowaste baby! 
1591 2018-12-11 21:17:25 lol! he took some words out of the headline :) it's how much a $1.7 million  Bugatti oil change costs :)
1592 2018-12-11 21:17:23 They are utterly reprehensible, they cheerleaded Obama’s awful foreign policy with Iran which made the world a far more dangerous place. They  ask endless spiteful motions against Israel for no other reason than to appease the oil producers. They are an epic failure.
1593 2018-12-11 21:17:20 I used basil, garlic salt, and Lemon pepper. They were seared in olive oil and a little butter.
1594 2018-12-11 21:17:11 CBD Oil journey is officially at Day 1. I’ll be chronicling this adventure and seeing how it helps my hydrocephalus complications and chronic neuropathy. Wish me luck. #CBDoil #bloggingadventures
1595 2018-12-11 21:17:08 You mean facts like the cleanest standards, highest human rights standards, need for oil going up and coming from less desirable producers. We can all pick facts that support our position.
1596 2018-12-11 21:17:06 Oil's current troubles: the last oil cycle ended in 2014. Oil demand doesn't grow as consistently and as strongly as it used to. Half the world's oil market is past peak demand. Now comes China, whose vehicle market cracked as EVs soared. 2019 gasoline forecast flat, no growth.
1597 2018-12-11 21:17:05 This is such a bad comment. This alone is enough for me to rethink my vote next year...consider I live in Alberta on the oil patch so...
1598 2018-12-11 21:17:02 I ordered the Moonstrual Oil Blend I've been dying to try 
1599 2018-12-11 21:17:01 Nothing more annoying than having to get something done for your car.. whether it’s oil change or flat tire, I hate dealing with it
1600 2018-12-11 21:16:56 Tulo was my fav
1601 2018-12-11 21:16:56 No, it _hasn't_ "provided an answer". It's supplied another thing that needs to be explained as stopgap *until* we find the actual explanation.

Anyone claiming to know anything about 'before' the Big Bang is just offering a speculation. And they're a snake oil salesman.
1602 2018-12-11 21:16:49 if you wanna put your best foot forward, add Truffle Oil... 
1603 2018-12-11 21:16:46 I used to sip that oil spill now I’m in the oil field 
1604 2018-12-11 21:16:45 I need a long ass back massage with warm oil 
1605 2018-12-11 21:16:44 US Closing prices: #DOW -0.21% #NASDAQ 0.32% #Ftse100 1.27% #GBPUSD 1.2498 #EURGBP 0.9059 #EURUSD 1.1322 #Gold 0.05% #Oil 0.15%
1606 2018-12-11 21:16:33 I see your point. But #quebec isn’t doing themselves any favors with comments like that while simultaneously blocking pipelines and accepting cash that (at least partially) comes directly from oil and gas.
1607 2018-12-11 21:16:23 No better feelings like when InshaAllah turns to Alhamdulillah
1608 2018-12-11 21:16:20 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.
1609 2018-12-11 21:16:14 Shit man... We can't own an oil well
1610 2018-12-11 21:16:10 They should no allow any Oil Corp to drill in water in the first place, as the risks of a spill is higher as well as the impact of such spill.
1611 2018-12-11 21:16:02 It's #InternationalMountainDay, and we wanted to share Lawren Harris' gorgeous piece "Icebergs and Mountains" to celebrate it!

1612 2018-12-11 21:15:52 I'm not too familiar with horse care so like. I have no idea. But I'd advise more against using vegetable oil topically ? Mostly just because it's a heavier oil and I think it could add more oil on top of the natural oil buildup from hair follicles
1613 2018-12-11 21:15:49 Wrap it in foil before checking 'er oil.
1614 2018-12-11 21:15:27 No LNG, no nuclear, no hydro, no oil, no coal. Ok. We’ll just freeze then.
1615 2018-12-11 21:15:20 Thousand points of light for big oil.
1616 2018-12-11 21:15:17 Palm oil sounds vegan to me
1617 2018-12-11 21:14:58 What about other industries who derive their living from oil, gas or coal??? I mean he could still be getting those oil dollars second hand from airlines, farms, car companies, banks who finance them...
1618 2018-12-11 21:14:56 Will look cheap compared to 100 oil.

1621 2018-12-11 21:14:42 please, no more oil into this fire. it's enough.
1622 2018-12-11 21:14:35 A strategic nuclear base in South America would be the same as US bases in Europe, Middle East and central Pacific... A subtle & leveraging posturing for the Kremlinites. #nukes #Venezuela #Bombers #oil #NewWorldOrders
1623 2018-12-11 21:14:34 if you don't absolutely hate yourself for ordering fettuccine alfredo when you're reheating it and all the oil shows itself, did you even go to Olive Garden?
1624 2018-12-11 21:14:33 The kingdom of oil is likely terrified of its sand castle falling down. Nothing terrifies oppressive regimes more than words of change and free press.

1626 2018-12-11 21:14:23 It’s not green party voters fault that the Democratic Party made a conscious decision to sell out the people and the planet for oil and gas donations. Obama chose to allow pipelines and gas extraction to grow exponentially on his shift. Clinton would’ve done the same.
1627 2018-12-11 21:14:00 Thanks to our friends at @WholeFoods for sponsoring Household Hazardous Materials Collection Day 2018! 

If you’re cooking up a spread this week or have been saving excess cooking oil but aren’t sure what to do with it, remember to bring it to us at Memorial Stadium on Dec. 15!
1628 2018-12-11 21:13:56 I want some cbd oil, badly.
1629 2018-12-11 21:13:56 Salt pepper vinegar oil ??
1630 2018-12-11 21:13:31 It's such a 'wicked combination' and a soul lifter anytime,  any day.
May your oil never run dry, beloved.
1631 2018-12-11 21:13:16 @TashaHutton Isaiah 61:3 To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes,the oil of joy for mourning,the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness;that they might be called trees of righteousness,the planting of the Lord,that he might be glorified.
1632 2018-12-11 21:13:13 What are you talking about? Did this person vape some lavender oil or something
1633 2018-12-11 21:13:11 Where it’s not working out it’s because of racists and people with vested interests driving fear.  Middle East it’s because America is driving division for oil or gas, ditto Russia. It’s not race or religion.
1634 2018-12-11 21:13:10 @NBCNews don't like farming, natural gas, oil and other resources.
WOW 
1635 2018-12-11 21:13:10 Big lie ,,I just finished An Agric business course at lbs ,and nothing to write home about in terms of our exports ..We know better bro ..Grow agricultural sector ,we can’t continue to be dependent on oil
1636 2018-12-11 21:13:04 Yes because with the current tariffs situation Farmers need more land. And with our current overproduction of oil in the world we need more oil? Am I missing something? I guess the Trump Administration just hates our country and our natural resources.
1637 2018-12-11 21:12:59 So just imagine how long a really big one will take? And from a career in the oil industry, will Big Oil & the Super Majors let it happen? Already more than enough refineries on the continent to handle it. Just not in Canada. That was an Alberta mistake 30 years ago.
1638 2018-12-11 21:12:51 Man oh Man, iu woyld love to oil you all up... do some oil all over you and give you a free total body rub down
1639 2018-12-11 21:12:40 If the government would simply fix the price for selling Alberta oil, companies would get $20 more per bbl x 3,200,000 barrels PER DAY = $64M/DAY more in the Economy or $23,700,000,000 per year, yes $23.7 Billion a year. That is the solution for ALLOWING  the USA to fix the price
1640 2018-12-11 21:12:32 Ask the US to send in their elite troops aka boys with toys. We have a  dictator already responsible for 1,000s of deaths of our citizens, we have massive oil reserves and a corrupt government, the best that money can buy! Think we tick all the boxes.
1641 2018-12-11 21:12:27 Trump keeps peaking at the cameras. This was obviously just a show. Trump can't Govern so he relies on his snake oil showmanship instead.
1642 2018-12-11 21:12:12 Olive oil on pasta, butter on bread. Anything else is sheerest decadence and debauchery.
1643 2018-12-11 21:12:04 My hair feels nice. I used tea tree essential oil in my shampoo blend instead of rosemary and peppermint as I ran out. But I actually prefer it.
1644 2018-12-11 21:12:02 Lol
1645 2018-12-11 21:11:58 Did your try mixing both together? Tea tree oil and sea salt and water? I did that I had mine for like 3 or 4 months and I did that and it gradually went away
1646 2018-12-11 21:11:54 Looks like a cow dung and not oil
1647 2018-12-11 21:11:40 This hair mask I do literally makes your hair grow a quarter inch overnight...yes I measured it. Egg yolk, olive oil, grapeseed oil and whatever other oils you want all mixed up together, you’re welcome
1648 2018-12-11 21:11:38 Sure. Just as soon as the oil companies give up their employee lists so we can see if there are any conservatives there.
1649 2018-12-11 21:11:30 I feel like I need to throw holy oil on my TLthe stuff ppl be retweeting is wild 
1650 2018-12-11 21:11:29 The move had to happen for both sides & hopefully for Tulo he finds a way stay healthy. Agree on the vet angle but my guess is much of that will fall onto Morales & Smoak, if Martin is moved.
1651 2018-12-11 21:11:28 The jackal snapped his fingers and a oil can exploded in Gavin's face covering him in oil
1652 2018-12-11 21:11:21 Dirty oil
1653 2018-12-11 21:11:21 Their oil was nationalized.
1654 2018-12-11 21:11:18 Coconut oil?
1655 2018-12-11 21:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza of the day will be: day-old crust with wet coconut oil and meat lovers.
1656 2018-12-11 21:11:03 Lol
Ororo is vegetable oil
1657 2018-12-11 21:10:57 Its not good for me at all. What i say is these people in these reach countries deserve better things than a third world country people. Venezuela and Russia are selling 10 milion barrels of oil each day but the people are in poverty. so #Putin must goes. so #maduro must goes.
1658 2018-12-11 21:10:51 The article states a factoid and asks "should we care?" Well, should we? Why should we?  What specifically does this data tell us about the relationship between O'Roarke and the oil and gas industry?
1659 2018-12-11 21:10:48 Snake oil is when a product doesn’t work and when it doesn’t offer a warranty. InfoSec is really one of the very few industries that gets away with that — for some reason.
1660 2018-12-11 21:10:44 it all goes back to the oil crisis
1661 2018-12-11 21:10:38 Imagine if rain drops were made out of coconut oil.
1662 2018-12-11 21:10:33 You think Fatty controls world oil prices, do you? LOL.

1665 2018-12-11 21:10:07 So you advocate becoming more reliant on transfer payments thus deepening our welfare state status even though that money comes directly from oil and gas in western Canada?  So as long as it NIMBY you’re good with the dirty cash?

1667 2018-12-11 21:09:59 No spamming. Also, not a creationist (which is snake oil) Only want you to back up the claims you made with scientific documentation.

Now back up your claims.
1668 2018-12-11 21:09:55 When I was a kid maybe 11 or 12 I spilled boiling hot oil on my hand, 3rd and 4th degree burns. Doctor was surprised when hairs started growing there after everything healed
1669 2018-12-11 21:09:26 When buying cbd online always request third party lab results that test for potency, pesticides, residual solvents, and mycotoxins of the CBD hemp oil. If a company is reluctant to share these results with you, that’s a red flag and indicate that they have something to hide.
1670 2018-12-11 21:09:22 Gue lagi begitu, itu sama ga ya kayak gatelnya gue? :') gue sih pake salep dermacoid sama ada medicated oil hee alhamdulillah ga lama sih tapi emang gatel dan sakit banget. Badan badan gue penuh bekas bekas bentol itu Ya Allah 
1671 2018-12-11 21:09:11 I have spent almost all my life outside. If there is one thing I know it is that the Earth is Alive!! Developers, industrialists, the oil industries, and ignorant politricksters like trump want to kill it. Maybe they just don't see because they don't want to. Time is short!
1672 2018-12-11 21:09:04 Free market policy enabled oil executives to suppress climate research for *decades* without accountability, and amass enough lobbying power to calcify opposition to any climate policy from the American right. Climate movements have long proposed solutions; they were suppressed.
1673 2018-12-11 21:09:03 Plan to meet Norm MacDonald: Step 1- have baby. Step 2- have friend make oil painting of Norm. I can do this.
1674 2018-12-11 21:09:02 I been due for an oil change and I just got one and I’m not supposed to have another one until April frfr !
1675 2018-12-11 21:09:01 Comes to get tires rotated, made the appointment to get tires rotated, waited an hour and a half AND THEY CHANGED MY OIL INSTEAD. now I’m having to wait longer so they can actually rotate my tires 
1676 2018-12-11 21:08:57 Warning to Edinburgh cyclists. There is oil on the road surface of Picardy Place roundabout. Approach with care. I got away with scrapes and bruises but someone else might not be so lucky. @CyclingEdin @Edinburgh_CC
1677 2018-12-11 21:08:38 My wokeness, how are they rapist? What should they have done? They should go and kill the man or stop her parents from giving him or elope with her? Pls be logical don't allow your sentiment override your sense of reasoning.

1684 2018-12-11 21:08:05 Aloe and coconut oil helped to clear up my dark marks.
1685 2018-12-11 21:08:00 African black soap and witch hazel then coconut oil
1686 2018-12-11 21:07:52 "Unless, of course, if it's Saudi Arabia, and then who cares?  Because I sold my soul for oil."
1687 2018-12-11 21:07:39 We produce more crude oil than the Saudi's. Maybe the reason for the low price is because we make so much oil that we export it.
1688 2018-12-11 21:07:36 Dem no get gold, oil nor bauxite chale ebi stress but how them for survive 
1689 2018-12-11 21:07:33 im at the tire place waiting for my oil change and i desperately want to take the tires off the racks and throw them like a wild ape but i cant because im an adult
1690 2018-12-11 21:07:33 I don't believe that was their original intent.  The carbon price will work fine if it's done properly, and big industrial polluters and oil & gas companies aren't exempt.  Having a global view is the only way to solve big problems.
1691 2018-12-11 21:07:28 so I put in some coconut oil and holy shit my hair smells like fucking curry
1692 2018-12-11 21:07:27 and in the universe having a bit of a giggle, the local ex oil and gas man just won 5 bags of coal in a raffle 
1693 2018-12-11 21:07:25 I've literally got a new battery and spark plugs for my car and it still won't start and if it's as simple as getting an oil change to fix it all I might go drink bleach

1696 2018-12-11 21:06:55 Renowned for our oil supply round here pal, it’s why our village is so affluent. Means we can run free shuttle buses to the game from the Wine Bar

1702 2018-12-11 21:06:16 time or so as his tenure as Chairman of Exall.  Then I saw Areva/Orano, JP Morgan, and Befesa and they just raised $9.9 mil.  I did not find a debt issue with Global and that was the issue with Exall and that oil dropped from $105/barrel to $35 from late '14 through '15.
1703 2018-12-11 21:05:51 Peel a couple heads of garlic, toss em in a mason jar, cover in neutral oil, seal lid 75%, & cook for 90 minutes (with an inch or two of water). Instant roast garlic confit for every winter recipe.

The list is endless...
1704 2018-12-11 21:05:40 Wait, wait, how about an annual oil lamp surprise box three times a year? Asking for a friend...

1713 2018-12-11 21:04:44 Ok so i see a couple oil lamps in my future
1714 2018-12-11 21:04:37 yes boss with my mentor bah.
1715 2018-12-11 21:04:36 Quebec wants Alberta's annual transfer payments but doesn't want to allow a pipeline from Alberta to NB. The oil price differential is costing our country $100million/day because AB cant get oil out and yet Quebec/Canada is taking in mid east oil by tanker in our ports. Env? BS!
1716 2018-12-11 21:04:33 I love when the hot oil hits my forehead while cooking  you never know when it’s coming so it just adds  to the suspense of it all  this is great !
1717 2018-12-11 21:04:27 Think of the problems that could be solved with fracking, coal, oil & in the Middle East.
1718 2018-12-11 21:04:26 @ScottishFA website moves at the speed of a very slow oil tanker doing a three point turn
1719 2018-12-11 21:04:10 He's probably a bit miffed because his beard oil has run out.
1720 2018-12-11 21:04:10 Clinton spent her time as SoS hawking fracking to the world. As you know, she refused to stand with standing rock. Didn’t want to piss off her oil and gas donors. Her presidency would’ve been a continuation of the status quo. There’s no time left to continue budiness as usual.
1721 2018-12-11 21:04:03 who brought the coconut oil

1724 2018-12-11 21:03:57 i would 100% recommend their marula oil if your skin is really dry and their vit b5 + hyaluronic acid. both will moisturize in diff ways without leaving your skin oily.
1725 2018-12-11 21:03:57 Pissy sub
1726 2018-12-11 21:03:43 I’m surprised there hasn’t been a refinery before. It makes sense to be close to the oil.
1727 2018-12-11 21:03:35 He says "oil and gas are for all Libyans", but bucks goes only for Tripolin-s.
1728 2018-12-11 21:03:34 He’s the largest shareholder in CN Rail which has lots and lots of oil tank cars.
1729 2018-12-11 21:03:32 @WBrettWilson Hi Brett. I appreciate that we, as Canadians, all have a vested interest in our domestic oil industry. My Qs: Do you believe in an oil-free future (at the right time)? If yes, how are you using your money and influence, today, to help get us there?
1730 2018-12-11 21:03:26 Secondly, I'd end subsidies for oil and gas producers. That gives them an obvious unfair advantage. I'd overrule state laws that give energy providers a monopoly over areas, forcing competition and allowing solar plants to come in and compete at a low cost.
1731 2018-12-11 21:03:21 Nice piece of jewelry you find there, add in a gift card and an essential oil.
1732 2018-12-11 21:03:16 Russian troll or Big Oil?

1734 2018-12-11 21:03:11 Courageous? You're kidding, right? How much money have you all made off the oil industry, Whitehouse? This is throwing crumbs at us while the GOP continues to cater to big oil for a big pay day. Your bill will do very little. You must think we're stupid. #propaganda

1741 2018-12-11 21:02:37 ceraVe daily moisturizing lotion is a great moisturizer, 100%.  coconut oil is a great oil cleanser to take off make up and the aveeno foaming cleanser is a great second cleanser. don't worry about toner. the ordinary is rly cheap and has great stuff. especially moisturizing oils

Who has over spent by 3 times promised! Signing our sovereignty away to the UN! shame on all you Lieberals!
1747 2018-12-11 21:01:59 @bc1 please explain the news value of the interview with Michele Jarvis Wonnacott.

At a time when politicians not only in the US but Canada too are claiming our major news outlets are providing false information how can you have an obvious charlatan on to promote her snake oil?
1748 2018-12-11 21:01:52 Live , vegetable oil and rice.
1749 2018-12-11 21:01:42 Dammit, it’s time for another oil change and alignment. Granted, I drive such short distances that it’s taken 6 months to drive 4,000 miles but these Denver streets require a rotation and alignment so...might as well
1750 2018-12-11 21:01:38 "Drought, flooding and ocean acidification all result from climate change."
That's what you call science? It is pure rubbish, it's pseudoscientific snake oil devoid of empirical evidence and something only an idiot would assert has any scientific merit of any kind.

1753 2018-12-11 21:01:27 By the way, destruction caused by fossil fuels, especially natural gas is the something that is real and significant. Try googling gas explosions, gas leaks, carbon monoxide poisoning, and oil spills. It's usually tax money used to deal with it too.
1754 2018-12-11 21:01:27 Well, the "recommended in the Edgar Cayce readings" is a big clue to this being snake oil.
1755 2018-12-11 21:01:21 I could not believe this was happening live. O M G. Every time I think we have reached the bottom, we seem to uncover a deep reservoir of underground crazy. It’s like we have an deep sea oil rig designed just to drill for crazy. WTF
1756 2018-12-11 21:01:20 Oil and vinegar smacks on subs!!
1757 2018-12-11 21:01:17 I def came in there confused and ended up paying $80 for an oil change 
1758 2018-12-11 21:01:00 I have to go get a damn oil change but I don’t wanna cause that requires me to put on real people clothes :-)
1759 2018-12-11 21:00:57 TT-TT my grandparents paid for my oil change and I'm very thankful
1760 2018-12-11 21:00:57 Paper straws worked back in the day but oil companies came up with a plastic one and people bought into it.  Oil companies said it would save the trees,  come on man. Oil industries kill trees in the long run.
1761 2018-12-11 21:00:56 oil cleansing
1762 2018-12-11 21:00:50 i unironically like kale, but it's only good if you get the "lacinato" or "dinosaur" variety and then kinda beat it up in a bowl with olive oil
1763 2018-12-11 21:00:49 Conservation is a guise to loot our resources, is it a coincidence that Lewa was paid for protective services in Ngamia One to the tune of 60Mn by tullow oil?
1764 2018-12-11 21:00:48 Lmaoo why yall acting like OIL doesnt remove makeup. Foh Makeup like this is perfect for  photoshoots that might have to do with water.

1767 2018-12-11 21:00:21 No we shouldn’t buy any of Saudi’s oil and buy oil from Canada instead.
1768 2018-12-11 21:00:20 
1769 2018-12-11 21:00:18 Yet he has never sold oil.
1770 2018-12-11 21:00:12 Dry skin: 
Separate one egg yolk in bowl, then blend 2 teaspoons of coconut oil, 1 teaspoon of olive oil and 1 teaspoon of honey until combined. Apply to face for 15 mins. Then wash with your regular cleanser to remove.
1771 2018-12-11 21:00:03 So you support the oil industry and that is why you are making these preposterous arguments?
1772 2018-12-11 20:59:54 Decided to spice up our sex life , but it turns out chilli oil was a poor choice of lubricant for all concerned. #1PUN
1773 2018-12-11 20:59:46 I doubt drilling for oil in ANWR came up in your discussion.
1774 2018-12-11 20:59:37 It’s oil, from a plant! I like it for the same reason I like prosciutto; it’s just less chewie/salty
1775 2018-12-11 20:59:02 The guy is very foolish and spews trash
1776 2018-12-11 20:58:53 Why do I find Acrylic Pouring and Abstract Oil Canvas videos on YouTube so relaxing? 

I could watch them for hours on end. 

I just feel so mellowed out when watching them. 

Just like a whisper of calmness washes over me and I just feel so peaceful and serene.
1777 2018-12-11 20:58:50 Your car is like an iPhone, everyone wants one. Plus it takes “coke” which is a product of oil, to make Tesla battery’s which helps the oil industry either way. #batteries #tesla
1778 2018-12-11 20:58:47 I fully respect you Andy, but on this very specific point, we're never going to agree.

If Canada has to do without AB EQ payments from oil, it'll survive. 

There may be a rougher patch for a while, but it will survive.

In fact, we are planning to be living without it by 2030.
1779 2018-12-11 20:58:46 That feeling when you get your oil changed car be running great 
1780 2018-12-11 20:58:33 We do, In BC, Alberta, Ontario, PQ and NB, but we do not have enough capacity to refine most of the oil we ship. And oil companies are unwilling to build the capacity....mostly. Probably because they are expecting reduced consumption
1781 2018-12-11 20:58:31 If it was that bad it's gonna need some conditioning. I've used a small pail of hot water with a glug of Murphy's Oil Soap and a splash of neatsfoot oil. One of those dollar store exfoliating gloves gets the stuck on stuff.

1783 2018-12-11 20:58:15 Oooooh more potty-mouthed nonsense from the master!! When does "explaining" something become "defending" Brett?  I mean, if someone finally "explained" how the government DOESN'T buy Saudi Oil to you would you just accuse them of "defending" the gov? Makes no sense. #MrArrogance
1784 2018-12-11 20:58:06 Yes 100% but the rest of them not at all, dude must be putting motor oil in his cereal in the morning or something to say something ignorant like that
1785 2018-12-11 20:58:00 Oil IS dirty and yes, everyone needs to be moving to renewable power sources. If Alberta focused on retraining and innovating to join everyone else in this effort, it would work out a lot better for them.
1786 2018-12-11 20:57:46 @JMV1070 I bet Jaylon and Rod Smith bring a hell of a crew to Lucas Oil...coming down from the fart
1787 2018-12-11 20:57:45 CBD is the new Snake Oil.
1788 2018-12-11 20:57:43 Olive Oil. Extra Virgin. Chilled.
1789 2018-12-11 20:57:38 I mean, if the shoe fits

1791 2018-12-11 20:57:23 Do u have any kind of oil..Vaseline or not...?
1792 2018-12-11 20:57:23 @MOBdance1 It's Olive Oil - dunno if this is the right account, text back if Im wrong
1793 2018-12-11 20:57:19 About to ask that question, cos i cant remember oil wells in kogi state
1794 2018-12-11 20:57:12 Global change will destroy Nations people will rise up against those who are profiting on oil, gas, pollutants in Industrial Products sold to American citizens. Who does the government represent people or industry and if it is industry  people shouldn't rise up
1795 2018-12-11 20:56:53 All is fair in the Left’s war against the Right
1796 2018-12-11 20:56:51 Some people give their pets CBD oil. It may be worth researching.
1797 2018-12-11 20:56:49 By saying Alberta oil is dirty so come and buy our hydro?  That's exactly how it feels.
1798 2018-12-11 20:56:47 Alberta has thousands of orphan wells that need attention.  Taxpayers will be on the hook while oil companies have billions in profits.
1799 2018-12-11 20:56:46 @HippingHall @Chef_OliMartin Wow Oil you are making my wife a nervous wreck. We thought you had nailed it and waited for Monica, Marcus and Greg’s decision and then they could not separate the three of you bloody well done. We knew you had it in you
1800 2018-12-11 20:56:45 Remember that one episode where Popeye got thrown out of the kitchen after getting caught with Olive Oil all over his fingers?
1801 2018-12-11 20:56:39 Biafra oil is the best Biafra light crude oil turn into Bonny light crude oil (BLCO) is the problem and my friend in US told that British can't do without BLCO. We have evidence of British greed on Biafra at expose contraption called Nigeria.
1802 2018-12-11 20:56:22 i use pens that are 100 cannabis oil and pens that preheat the thick oil before vaping. Like the pods.
1803 2018-12-11 20:56:14 i'm not sure how you think honey is worse than palm oil but ok

bees are exploited just as much in the process of cultivating avocados as they are for their honey

1806 2018-12-11 20:56:04 Advert comes on TV...Mum asks what’s this with gorillas and Palm Oil? Are they catching them and taking it out their hands???? DEAD SERIOUS
1807 2018-12-11 20:55:59 And, imo, CBD oil without the THC just...doesn't work. At least for me. I'm not a fan of Being High™ but I have a bottle of oil with zero THC and I get nothing from it.
1808 2018-12-11 20:55:52 Coconut oil
1809 2018-12-11 20:55:47 Hay God I remember when somebody will go to green house to go and beg for oil or crayfish for abacha or any ingredient till everything complete

1810 2018-12-11 20:55:44 Coconut oil girrlllllll 
1811 2018-12-11 20:55:11 Sometimes I just put oil in my hair so it forces me to wash it tbh
1812 2018-12-11 20:55:07 Sorry to hear! You are going to want to get an oil consumption test completed at an authorized Subaru dealer and we can look into it from there. customercare@Subaru.ca Thanks!
1813 2018-12-11 20:55:06 yup pretty much how I feel about it ..if our fellow citizens are struggling we pull together  but must be honest it's get's harder n harder not to resent the oil industry aholes , but if they have kids who need support , it's no fault of their's ..the parents are selfish shits
1814 2018-12-11 20:55:05 Wild growth oil  is my personally my fav oil to help stimulate hair growth . I also do a lot of deep conditioning and hot oil treatments.
1815 2018-12-11 20:55:03 I hope that peppermint oil you ingested is cooking your insides
1816 2018-12-11 20:55:00 Last time I check, I didn't force you to read the thread, did I? So rude
1817 2018-12-11 20:54:59 Define "damage to environment" caused by oil/coal.
1818 2018-12-11 20:54:48 I’m a firm believer of oil of oregano now. Like wow! I can’t explain how much better I feel.
1819 2018-12-11 20:54:46 Why...

1823 2018-12-11 20:54:13 In a spell of impromptu Hanukkah spirit I just put far too much oil in my beard.
1824 2018-12-11 20:54:06 Hasn't this anomaly already been debunked enough? Under Obama the U.S. had already been slowly increasing production of oil plus plus making huge gains in energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy. Trump DID NOTHING! Sad.
1825 2018-12-11 20:53:59 One of the girls at work looked at me like I was crazy when I told her that I knew how to change a tire and change the oil in my car. I didn’t realize this wasn’t a normal thing for girls to know how to do. 
1826 2018-12-11 20:53:58 Me too. I think of how I used to use baby oil to help myself tan. Yikes. Then again, that was in the dark ages before regular sunscreen-use became a thing. 
1827 2018-12-11 20:53:49 The name of a town doesn’t really narrow anything down. I live in Medicine Hat. Im just smart enough to know that Rachel Notley doesn’t control oil prices.
1828 2018-12-11 20:53:45 bitch me to sksksksjs I can't say the word "oil"
1829 2018-12-11 20:53:44 oil slick!
1830 2018-12-11 20:53:41 Economists, scientists, etc (justifiably) point to declining oil use in coming decades, combined with the current, and increasing world supply, I wouldn't bet on there being much/any demand for this new refinery past 2040...
1831 2018-12-11 20:53:40 The lowest unemployment rate in the whole UK, lowest youth unemployment rate, best NHS performance and a 200 billion economy between 5.5 million, people and oil and gas wealth, the EU wants us as long as we become independent democratically.  

We will do alright for ourselves.

1839 2018-12-11 20:52:19 Laughable to say the least. If you're judging him for the period outside of this report yes but he put measure in place after the oil  "leak" of 2008 -2012 to then see it moved from less than 50 barrels in 2015-2016 to nearly 200 barrels.
1840 2018-12-11 20:52:13 Same people bitching about buying Saudi Oil will be bitching about this announcement.
1841 2018-12-11 20:52:01 Actually we drilled more oil at home under obama ! Stop lying
1842 2018-12-11 20:52:00 Bring machine oil
1843 2018-12-11 20:51:52 If you’re stressed try CBD oil. A bunch of our podcast guests, James included, have used it and have wonderful results for minimizing stress/anxiety related stress. 

1844 2018-12-11 20:51:44 Can’t believe I ran out of my Haitian oil.
1845 2018-12-11 20:51:37 Just add a lil vegetable oil haha
1846 2018-12-11 20:51:28 By chance, are you involved in the oil and gas industry over there? I do a lot of work in that field.
1847 2018-12-11 20:51:26 Apply Vaseline or castor oil on the roots before you sleep everyday. Works wonders
1848 2018-12-11 20:50:59 Broccoli is a lesser veg but I have found that haters are converted by roasting it in a hot oven with a bit of salt, pepper, oil and you can do garlic if you are cool. The taste and texture both improve. It is both crispy and tender rather than dense and blah.
1849 2018-12-11 20:50:55 I agree we have no time to waste and that is exactly all the Dems do! They sadly have made #ClimateChange another one of their political footballs that they can say they are on the progressive side but still take money from dirty oil companies!  #shills
1850 2018-12-11 20:50:54 Gerry did she do any homework on you, Justine and the Liberal party. Well if so and she is still willing to work for your Country Killing Crooked Liberal Party she cannot be that great

Hopefully she discovers the snake in the oil bottle before it’s too late for her soul too
1851 2018-12-11 20:50:41 Love that the #gop #magats are so low rent that this lead tainted snake oil salesman and performance artist  is considered legitimate in the party of cons.
1852 2018-12-11 20:50:41 Cured my daughter's sore throat with a new formula of elderberry and oregano oil. $14 shipped 4 ounces.
1853 2018-12-11 20:50:26 The magic ball or dartboard approach - ask martin about price elasticity and their insane $150-$200 oil forecast
1854 2018-12-11 20:50:10 Probably to give to ISIS or some backed terror group to claim democracy in some oil rich country.. the trend will continue until this ends.
1855 2018-12-11 20:50:06 Is Russia participating in Cop24? Trump and Putin should dare each other to sign up...

Renewables are the future, no need to get left behind! We will need oil for a little while but the need is there to transition. Also like China (and India?) we need their official backing. 
1856 2018-12-11 20:50:00 and have respect for every worker , business owner and services provided to us all ...from the corner store owners working their asses off everyday to survive to the folks working on high tech green energy for instance . oil fumes have damaged some prairie folks humanity/humility

1859 2018-12-11 20:49:23 Do you clean your pillows regularly? Sounds like oil buildup if it's on a particular side or random
1860 2018-12-11 20:49:16 I'm also embarrassed/ irritated that we listened to what @RachelNotley said, then she did something totally different once elected.I'm irritated that our own country buys oil from a country that supports terrorism and other human rights violations! Stand up for Canada!

1867 2018-12-11 20:48:22 Not taking the story writers word the pledge was broken. Beto didn't take pac money and the label "executive" could be a VP of sales. Using "executives" to insinuate that he was basically bought by oil and gas seems weak to me.
1868 2018-12-11 20:48:22 Topic is have you any outrage towards Canada continuing to support Saudi through the purchase of their oil when they murder and oppress women?

Pretty simple question...
1869 2018-12-11 20:48:03 Drilling for new oil has nothing to do with gas prices and it doesn't create new jobs either in the US.  Saving coastal economies produces 12 times more jobs!  Plus, OPEC just scrambled to stabilize crude which is at an all time LOW!
1870 2018-12-11 20:48:02 I could never really understand why this has not been done previously. China does not want our dirty oil, it goes to US for refining and I understand we buy it back.
1871 2018-12-11 20:47:31 ya like all the self entitled oil assholes in the prairies ..they assume one can't possibly be in business and willingly pay all their various taxes which  after all build the infrastructure all businesses rely on and that we can care about the quality of life of others ....
1872 2018-12-11 20:47:25 Me I am coming..just to see choima she too fine..oil dey her head

1875 2018-12-11 20:47:15 No.

It is not.

No matter how much Albertans like to believe that Canada depends on AB oil (and must be grateful for it) for its survival, that is myth, utter BS.

It is a crisis for undiversified Alberta.

It is not a crisis for much more diversified Canada.

1879 2018-12-11 20:47:04 Because she fights for Wall Street at the expense of the working class, complains that the GOP is denying climate change while she exported fracking to the world and supported pipelines, supports wars for oil. I could go on and on.

1888 2018-12-11 20:46:13 Notely would have more credibility on this file if she hadn’t dedicated her pre-Premier life to thwarting oil development. It would be helpful if she did an interview describing her sudden epiphany about how integral oil is to prosperity, employment and quality of life in Canada.
1889 2018-12-11 20:46:13 In my country, the only subsidy is going from the oil producing provinces to the non oil producing provinces. The monies flowing in the opposite direction from what you describe.
1890 2018-12-11 20:46:08 So why are we buying billions in oil from Saudi Arabia instead of Alberta?
1891 2018-12-11 20:46:06 Are they not. My dad was 15 back home and the British came to his village in Sudan to “help” with the poverty issue. He said they set up big rigs under ground and at night would have airplanes take them. They later realized they were taking oil, gold, and diamonds back to England
1892 2018-12-11 20:46:06 He showed them as the illegal immigrant loving hacks that they are. Willing to have Americans die so they can get more votes.
1893 2018-12-11 20:46:06 @KennonNHodges hi. I need to ask you somethin!
1894 2018-12-11 20:45:50 The Elite think going to remote villages and supply people with blankets in Winter is an achievement....that's exploitation...! Go there in Summer and build school, clinics, improve their road network, give them technical support to till the Land... not cooking oil and fish..
1895 2018-12-11 20:45:45 Like does the oil help with acne?
1896 2018-12-11 20:45:43 Venezuelans & Russians don't need to be told what this means Sir!
What you should mind is what it MEANS for REGIONAL & GLOBAL SECURITY
Is Trump adm. going to turn a blind eye on Putin's encroaching in #Latam as it does regarding UkraineARE OIL / GOLD DEALS ABOVE US SECURITY
1897 2018-12-11 20:45:40 You wrote an erroneous article. You're the villain. You want to gut water protections. You are in the pocket of oil companies, industrial facilities & developers & want to exempt them from programs that aim to protect our water. Smaller bodies of water do seep into larger bodies!
1898 2018-12-11 20:45:35 My greatest fear is going to get my oil changed and the guy telling me I need repairs done urgently but I don’t really need them done but I don’t know that and also he calls me “sweetheart” the whole time
1899 2018-12-11 20:45:32 Actually
I'm in my fucking house
It's under renovation and one of the guys is using oil for... smth (i think it's for cleaning)

I'm in my room rn and it stopped
1900 2018-12-11 20:45:30 Addison, an esthetician once told me to put grapeseed oil on instead of moisturizer and my SKIN. PEELED. OFF. IN. STRIPS.
1901 2018-12-11 20:45:19 Best thing she could do is call election as early as possible and get out of the way. No more damaging policy's and fake support for the oil. Industry to buy votes. Everyone knows she's a liar.
1902 2018-12-11 20:45:12 Adaiyi ahankali 
1903 2018-12-11 20:45:04 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1904 2018-12-11 20:45:01 Does that include pride in the Saudi Gender Lens oil Canada requires??

1908 2018-12-11 20:44:35 Avoid this snake oil seller. The only interest he has is in promoting himself and couldn't give two hoots about you or anyone else.
1909 2018-12-11 20:44:33 Name one subsidy the oil industry gets. Just one. Unless, you and I have a different view about what a “subsidy” is.
1910 2018-12-11 20:44:26 @noellenikpour -Paul was one of  worst pit traders  of all time but YET  one of the best positions traders ever   But that comment is like when I said on @cnbc about the API report if the report comes out bullish for oil it will go up and if it comes out  bearish it will go down
1911 2018-12-11 20:44:13 That would be cool, for personal transportation. But oil is far safer and more efficiently transported through pipelines. Not to mention less expensive.
1912 2018-12-11 20:44:12 I'm assuming you and your family have been u touched by recession and oil field layoffs.I'm embarrassed as well, embarrassed that we elected someone who has zero experience in running a country, he has never had to work for a living,do you get that?He lives off a trust fund!
1913 2018-12-11 20:44:01 Wow I finally grew up & got my oil changed & tires rotated on my own:)
1914 2018-12-11 20:43:57 Easily. If you don’t know the properties of a herb, or how it works in your body, because you haven’t done any research..it may as well be snake oil.
1915 2018-12-11 20:43:54 ye, & use the oil residue. the actual plant being in the food upsets your stomach
1916 2018-12-11 20:43:46 The oil axis
1917 2018-12-11 20:43:39 The Witcher:
It was a rainy day in Kaer Morhen. Vesemir was teaching new recruits about big Boars. 'Use  Beast Oil against them', he said, 'It'll make your jobs easier'.
1918 2018-12-11 20:43:32 If not for their locations, I might agree. Mothra is supposed to be in some facility somewhere in China, but the first kaiju looks like it's erupting from a Texas oil field. The kaiju on the right has two visible spines of some sort, and Rodan doesn't burrow. Maybe new MUTOs.
1919 2018-12-11 20:43:26 Fossil fuel is B's. How hard do you squeeze a fossil to get a litre of oil.
Oil is a renewable substance.
1920 2018-12-11 20:43:21 why do we olive shame? why do we only want “extra virgin” why not “medium virgin” or “sexually experienced” olive oil? it’s 2018.
1921 2018-12-11 20:43:09 Jason Kenney... explore the Churchill and Hudson Bay as oil destination. Whether by rail or by pipeline... it gets the oil to Tanker traffic port.
1922 2018-12-11 20:43:04 big time. 
1923 2018-12-11 20:42:47 شي نعمه 
1924 2018-12-11 20:42:37 There was a very impressive temperature inversion in the atmosphere this morning (temps warming with height) that likely trapped the smell from oil fields near the surface. South winds carried that odor from south to north through Austin.
1925 2018-12-11 20:42:30 has anybody tried CBD oil for anxiety?? pls lemme know
1926 2018-12-11 20:42:28 Where are your protests of Texas pipelines and tankers?  Why no protests in North Dakota?  Texas just discovered the largest single oil deposit in the world and North Dakota is now producing more oil than Venezuela.  You only protest Canada getting to the world market. #AstroTurf
1927 2018-12-11 20:42:15 Why do oil companies, pharmaceutical Companies, Coal companies and the Auto industry need subsidies?
1928 2018-12-11 20:42:11 Sunny d also uses canola oil
1929 2018-12-11 20:42:04 You were promised by a snake oil selling con man. You've been duped. Your wall was never going to happen and it never will.
1930 2018-12-11 20:41:58 Avoid Quebec and the East. Run the oil through Churchill and Hudson Bay. Tankers can take the oil from Churchill to Eastern Canada as well as out to the world.
1931 2018-12-11 20:41:58 ياساتر 
1932 2018-12-11 20:41:52 Baby arugula, tomatoe, prosciutto, balsamic vinegar, virgin olive oil, grilled goat cheese on French bread, yummy!!!
1933 2018-12-11 20:41:48 I need to oil my scalp  I wish someone else would do it: getting ya scalp moisturized be feeling sooo gooooddd !
1934 2018-12-11 20:41:46 The oppression of women is perpetuated by the stranglehold of authoritarian regimes who use religion to control the people. Without outside interference due to oil and geopolitics these nations would have evolved away from theocracies long ago in my opinion.
1935 2018-12-11 20:41:37 That boy is spoiling you Ba 
1936 2018-12-11 20:41:33 I’d think that would be a good sign wouldn’t it. I mean if they are out there for oil and oil is found or are we talking problems with the drill? What’s the story with this post?
1937 2018-12-11 20:41:28 Nothing says diversifying the economy like building an oil refinery. good grief.
1938 2018-12-11 20:41:26 Looks like an oil painting! Beautiful!
1939 2018-12-11 20:41:24 Fixes oil leaks as well 
1940 2018-12-11 20:41:22 My fart exceeds on your flower 
1941 2018-12-11 20:41:18 I skim it off and use it separately as a flavoured oil when frying veggies, or adding to mashed potatoes. Can add to dog food as a treat or put it out for the birds.

1943 2018-12-11 20:41:05 Good morning and i was about to put hte cooking oil in the freezer the feq
1944 2018-12-11 20:41:03 Just to say re authenticity, this is v similar to the traditional Italian dish of oranges and olive oil with cracked pepper, salt and sometimes olives.. 
1945 2018-12-11 20:41:03 I'm not sure a crust punk elf starting a magical fire in an oil drum in front of a wall covered in anti-orc sloganeering is in keeping with THE SEASON tbh
1946 2018-12-11 20:40:46 What happens to the first nation held lands?  Including the oil rich ones since they do not belong to Alberta?
1947 2018-12-11 20:40:46 Still silent on the Saudi Oil...guess women’s rights only matter to you sometimes
1948 2018-12-11 20:40:43 I have so much sympathy for teething  babies now! Clove oil was the only thing that helped numb the pain for me. Hope you feel better soon!
1949 2018-12-11 20:40:33 Might the agenda be: ‘Eliminate as many civilians by whatever means to leave the way clear for a massive oil grab’..?
1950 2018-12-11 20:40:32 It’s not just a matter of counting on oil...

What the greenies don’t get is oil is a necessity 

Will that change? Probably and I hope so... but it’s not gonna change for decades

And Alberta is getting punished for it...
1951 2018-12-11 20:40:27 I was confused what an oil banker was , journalists have to help each other out haha!
1952 2018-12-11 20:40:20 You think the NDP here is a very far from the the talking points of Kenney on Oil?
1953 2018-12-11 20:40:20 Next time try extracting the THC out of the plant first You can do this by laying the weed inside a frying pan,and then put some cooking oil up in there too,put that side the oven for and let it heat up for like 5 minutes tops,then pass the mixture through a filter,and mix it wit
1954 2018-12-11 20:40:12 ああ、これ？スポーツブラ。油の貯蔵庫が垂れちゃうからね。
1955 2018-12-11 20:40:06 Fracking doesn't produce heavy oil so they will still need some imports. But the value of exports exceeds the value of imports so that the US doesn't not have a financial trade deficit with oil and gas.
1956 2018-12-11 20:40:05 Need to do away with the oil based plastic materials entirely and move on to hemp based plastics.
1957 2018-12-11 20:40:03 I just put air in my tires , checked my oil and filled up my antifreeze so basically i’m a mechanic
1958 2018-12-11 20:40:03 Low key really pumped on my copaiba oil
1959 2018-12-11 20:39:51 Sorry,the word elusive applies solely to you,the so called liberals...despite demonetisation leading to broadening of tax base and direct transfer of payments, the unparalleled foreign policies that cleared india's allowance to import oil from iran....1/2
1960 2018-12-11 20:39:46 You can tell because the oil and gas sector isn't really that bothered - it knows that the wells have to be drilled and produced no matter what technique is used on them...
1961 2018-12-11 20:39:44 With 7k (4L Total Engine oil and a new oil filter) the car is ready to be serviced.
1962 2018-12-11 20:39:39 A mirror would be useful.  Decades of AB Conservative govts in collusion w vastly rich oil companies squandered the people’s petroleum-wealth.  #unlikeNorway
1963 2018-12-11 20:39:23 Smell the flowers .. the best treatment for now 
1964 2018-12-11 20:39:21 Yea, only several hundred trillion dollars and 1 or 2 human lifespans before we will have to move elsewhere for energy and oil product needs. Hardly worth looking at.
1965 2018-12-11 20:39:11 RT younglivingeo iAmMyZodiacSign That's great Ness! How do you like using this oil?!
1966 2018-12-11 20:39:05 Behind this is Big Energy. They are creating racism so as to mask the real problem, wars over OIL. I write about it in my book, Solar Enchantment Now at Amazon Books. I call for a Declaration of War on Global Warming.
1967 2018-12-11 20:39:00 I.e. did you see John McDonnald today (if you're from the UK) speaking at a Scottish energy sector conference saying that Labour intended to do everything it could to support the Scottish Oil and Gas sector? Fracking is a side argument - its just a well stimulation technique.
1968 2018-12-11 20:38:55 There are a lot of different ways to define "working class", and you definitionally wouldn't have met some of them, and I bet you wouldn't've met any of them. And if you were an Oil & Gas CEO of a company of one, you still could have donated up to $200 to Beto!
1969 2018-12-11 20:38:51 Hope you feel better soon. Try some Olbas oil and boiling water in a steam inhaler cup.
1970 2018-12-11 20:38:51 Abstract painting sounds fun but I have only oil paints and I dont want to ruin everything around me
1971 2018-12-11 20:38:49 Seems that "dill oil" is this year's trendy Masterchef thing. Seems like it's been in almost every episode.
1972 2018-12-11 20:38:42 People who know about cars ONLY, 5W30 or 0W40 fully synthetic oil?? Need one that lasts as long as possible and can put up with my hard revving 
1973 2018-12-11 20:38:41 We absolutely need to diversify. That said, we still have an oil and gas industry. Do you have evidence to go along with your claim that a new refinery won’t be profitable?
1974 2018-12-11 20:38:30 .
Even #UK has dumped Nuclear Waste into the Sea ... eventually, that waste will leak ... despite the assurances, in time leaks will happen

1978 2018-12-11 20:38:15 Yup. I use a beard wash and conditioner then outside the shower I use beard balm. Used to use beard oil but didn't really like it nor was it doing much for me
1979 2018-12-11 20:38:11 call around to different places and ask what their prices are for an oil change..
1980 2018-12-11 20:38:11 This ref is on the take , PSG definitely sent some oil money his way
1981 2018-12-11 20:38:03 Turn off the tap! Quebec doesn’t socially accept oil.
1982 2018-12-11 20:37:56 Is this like oil and valves and cylinders and stuff?  Hydraulics?
1983 2018-12-11 20:37:38 Data is valuable than oil and other lucrative FMGs combined. Bold, interesting, fact
1984 2018-12-11 20:37:34 Now baby oil.
1985 2018-12-11 20:37:22 Paper cut you say? How wonderful, rub some coconut oil on your ass hole. Funny how you use my words back on me. Are you lacking originality, or?
1986 2018-12-11 20:37:21 Wonder what beard oil @KingJames use
1987 2018-12-11 20:37:15 Is that oil on canvas?
1988 2018-12-11 20:37:11 Pay for my oil change so I know it’s real
1989 2018-12-11 20:37:11 @Ferknuckle throwing mates who showed up to work under the bus while you collected 4 mill from home for two years? Hall (who's taking he heat) finished in top ten in points in back to back years in Edm.  If he did it hung over he's comparable to other Oil legends of the past.
1990 2018-12-11 20:37:04 Wha d heck is womb oil ....is that a Trevor Sayers something again ..
1991 2018-12-11 20:37:02 i be sippin motor oil bitch i got the horse power
1992 2018-12-11 20:37:01 Salah is King!!!
1993 2018-12-11 20:37:01 Very true. And it’s not cleaner, there isn’t proper regulations on the oil industry to make fuel cleaner. And you’re right, it’s at a cost of the taxpayer.
1994 2018-12-11 20:36:58 Would rather eat a tub of coconut oil than a drop of castor tho 
1995 2018-12-11 20:36:43 Cramp شديد
1996 2018-12-11 20:36:38 is chicken broth considered an essential oil
1997 2018-12-11 20:36:36 The biggest money spinner can be how you tackle waste. So many advance technology is available but need steel will to implement. Can make furnace oil out of thrown plastics and male profits for example.
1998 2018-12-11 20:36:28 More taxes to get and send to Pakistan, Sudan, Somalia, Syria and the rest while oil rich countries keep fleecing us!
1999 2018-12-11 20:36:27 Legends of To-Meow-Meow is pretty much a perfect hour of television.
Just the epitome of running a concept into an oil tanker like it was a 747.
2000 2018-12-11 20:36:20 Oya do the oil
2001 2018-12-11 20:36:04 While the pastors get treatment from the best hospitals in the world his church members relies on prayers and Anointing oil.
2002 2018-12-11 20:36:03 THC oil... help my guts.

2005 2018-12-11 20:35:58 Done nothing other than blame? Record highs in GDP, record unemployment for women and blacks, more money in our pockets, gas below $2 oh and America exporting oil for the first time in decades bc of his regulations!

2008 2018-12-11 20:35:46 @HarrisonFordLA i just the series years living dangerously re palm oil destroying indonesia's forest. I admire your restraint during your interview with the ministry of forest. Bravo. I was yelling at the tv.
2009 2018-12-11 20:35:41 The price is maintained by everyone agreeing not to sell their oil at once so as to not flood the market. So it's held in oil reserves. Mainly by OPEC. OPEC decided to flood the market, crashing the price, causing the entire global oil economy to collapse because Trump's an idiot
2010 2018-12-11 20:35:32 How you hoes claim to be “ high maintenance “ but ya oil need a change an ya tires tires need a rotation gtfoh..

2015 2018-12-11 20:34:22 “I am not thinking about Ayers naked and rubbed down in oil.”
2016 2018-12-11 20:34:15 In all honesty, it'd be easier to tear it down from within than counter it with another alliance. If I had to choose though, I'd begin with starving Europe's oil and gas supply, so all middle eastern countries, Venezuela and Mexico would be at least under it's influence 1/
2017 2018-12-11 20:34:10 That's not the way this works. We're running a 3 million barrel per day surplus and have been for about a decade. We have WAAAAAAAAY more oil than we or anyone will ever use. If we burn it all, everything on earth dies. Drilling more is irrelevant. This is why the price collapsed
2018 2018-12-11 20:33:59 Why is that we do not refine our own oil? Would it help? I'm ignorant on this.
2019 2018-12-11 20:33:58 Vitamin E oil! I get mine from Trader Joe’s but I’m sure any pure kind will work it’s also really good for scars and marks on your skin overall
2020 2018-12-11 20:33:53 What’s the dumbest thing you ever did as a kid?

When I was 4, I put one of those bath oil balls in my nose. My mom rushed me to the ER and all the doctor did was hand me a tissue and asked me to ‘blow’
2021 2018-12-11 20:33:52 #BelieveWomen
2022 2018-12-11 20:33:41 Sitting in the car dealership getting an oil change is entertaining. Ring tones, a woman riveted by the tv, what other people do to while away the time. I knit and read - not at the same time unfortunately.
2023 2018-12-11 20:33:40 Yeah castor oil and tea tree oil and I use this beard wash
2024 2018-12-11 20:33:39 The great power of the American senators is insulting every day, we will not be able to fight armies even with toilet paper. See the truth that you have nothing but God tax oil
2025 2018-12-11 20:33:37 I like all such tweets. To your point, it’s been important since the 70’s!! What feels scary is how OUR government has allowed business to control the politics to this point of no-return. NOW it’s more scary because it’s clear those who want melting iceways to get the oil, won.
2026 2018-12-11 20:33:37 Hate to be one of those people whose personality is only expressed via the shit they repost but the only 'interesting' thing I have to say is 'fuck, it's cold'. Stay warm, oil up, rub chillies, onions, and garlic over yourself and sit in the oven. 20 mins @ 220. Be delicious
2027 2018-12-11 20:33:36 @JPTasker Hi John, just thought id let you know of a small typo in your first nations pipeline story. In the photo cutline it says oil banker rather than tanker.
2028 2018-12-11 20:33:33 Body pain and productivity boost is why I take high dosage (1000mg bottle) CBD oil tincture sublingually diluted in OJ. Sleep aid too. I don't enjoy smoking or vaping so it's kinda the only way I can do it.
2029 2018-12-11 20:33:29 Lol let's share money instead

2031 2018-12-11 20:33:27 I've been there, crying on the phone to the NHS at 2am whilst sucking ice cubes...clove oil was revolting but did actually help alongside the antibiotics and codeine
2032 2018-12-11 20:33:25 i’m making fries!!! my mom got me an air fryer so i don’t have to burn myself with hot oil
2033 2018-12-11 20:33:20 I need my lavender oil, stat!
2034 2018-12-11 20:33:14 He said it in a hilarious way
2035 2018-12-11 20:33:12 Mine used to open a tin of sardines in oil all year around until Christmas, then it was in tomato sauce 
2036 2018-12-11 20:32:51 Hebrew Word .... קְנֵה-בֹשֶׂם.... Kaneh-Bosm found in Exodus 30:23... Did God command Moses to buy 250 Shekels of Cannabis to make the Holy Annointing Oil ?
2037 2018-12-11 20:32:47 oh yea no games journalists aren't to be trusted at all they're basically like snake oil salesmen

2040 2018-12-11 20:32:38 I like the Olive oil one the best.
2041 2018-12-11 20:32:33 We going to skip over the fact this man bleeds oil?
2042 2018-12-11 20:32:32 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*
2043 2018-12-11 20:32:22 A) those are 1980s era bombers - knock off B1s, not a real threat B) they most certainly are NOT armed C) clearly a theatrical STUNT ...either way, all the bullshit wont save any of them #Putin #Trump #Maduro & lets not forget, this whole shit show is about #Oil @AV8intheblue
2044 2018-12-11 20:32:21 @Shazam There’s a lot of Snake Oil Salespeople Out There Selling Anything and Everything!
Beware!
People Will Throw Their Mom Under the Bus for a Dollar!
2045 2018-12-11 20:32:18 U.S. becomes net exporter in oil for the first time in 70 years. We are energy independent. If this was done under any other president it would be considered one of, if not, their biggest accomplishment. It's massive
2046 2018-12-11 20:32:10 Bull put this oil on my hand and that shit actually smells really good lol
2047 2018-12-11 20:32:10 i was telling nav how eating coconut oil shortens your period and reduces bleeding and she goes “AND CLOGS YOUR ARTERIES”
2048 2018-12-11 20:32:04 I’ve joined the Chebe powder fam, I just hope it isn’t a scam like coconut oil 
2049 2018-12-11 20:32:00 Thank You Americans for drilling the Bakken & Permian Basin.  We produce more oil than any other country. Those two oil finds will last 100 years
2050 2018-12-11 20:31:50 A dictator was installed who went to war with the Venezuelan people who fought back, some died and many escaped to Columbia and elsewhere, those who remain live on their knees.
Venezuela is very OIL rich.
2051 2018-12-11 20:31:46 Trump is poisoning our rivers and streams,  deregulation to let oil and gas contaminate them. Why are the Republicans letting him poison their own grandkids. Are the rich trying to kill off as many poor and middle class people as possible. Where is the militia when you need one.
2052 2018-12-11 20:31:25 The government doesn’t import oil from Saudi Arabia...only one company does and that is Irving...although, you know this and are still choosing to mislead Canadians.
2053 2018-12-11 20:31:01 who do cheap oil changes lbs? i don’t wanna give nissan no $60, period
2054 2018-12-11 20:31:01 Dow people should keep in mind the good trade deals POTUS has made. China giving 15% rate for cars. Shipping of our domestic oil at a profit. Our CIC has done a good job with Mexico,Canada. We need more energy + DJT is getting it for USA not wave,solar,inane stuff.
2055 2018-12-11 20:31:01 Omo Iya skincare expert, Omo baba oil&gas.  What a perfect combo
2056 2018-12-11 20:30:58 Yeah tried the aura really nice paint goes for miles drys quick so on large areas I just damp down and brush on drys nice and flat two coats over yellow oil solid also like the advance too 
2057 2018-12-11 20:30:57 Show some respect.
2058 2018-12-11 20:30:55 So, it starts, runs, has oil pressure, charges the battery and drives just fine.

2066 2018-12-11 20:30:24 I remember when someone said "drill baby, drill" to get us out of high oil prices  ($4.00/gal) and Obama  said that "we can't just drill our way out of the problem". Hmmm, guess he was wrong again. Score another one for Trump.
2067 2018-12-11 20:30:20 The last thing anyone wants is an oil spill, you can bet that it won’t be some foreign speaking rookie white knuckling his way through reefs on the edge of disaster like this portrays. There will be strict regulations if it ever goes.
2068 2018-12-11 20:30:14 Yeah, I agree, I mean, I go to the Merlin shops all the time for my oil changes and they do the job really well
2069 2018-12-11 20:30:11 To heal a pimple quickly, apply tea tree oil on pimple every few hours, and apply vitamin E oil on the spot, about 1 hour before bedtime.
2070 2018-12-11 20:30:11 OMFG ..seriously  this is just too much  you're talking to an owner of a trucking company we employ hundreds and btw the economy doesn't run without us  their is mutual dependence in our two industries however we are willing to face a future where oil won't be powering us
2071 2018-12-11 20:30:05 I definitely should’ve ate before I got to my oil change. 
2072 2018-12-11 20:30:02 Bitch why did I just get my hair oil that’s normally $40 for $11!!!!!!!
2073 2018-12-11 20:29:59 Have Barca put olive oil on the pitch?
2074 2018-12-11 20:29:57 All these pop up CBD oil companies are gearing up to make a lot of money off people’s ignorance.
2075 2018-12-11 20:29:56 Sounds like a child tbh! Surprised he hasn't tried to sell you some CBD oil
2076 2018-12-11 20:29:51 It's a dramatic change that showed up in 2H 2018, and it'a already changed the outlook for China's gasoline demand outlook for 2019. i.e. a major factor in what happened to the price of oil in the past few months.
2077 2018-12-11 20:29:49 That oil rig money and food life

2080 2018-12-11 20:29:25 Notley came to the scene roaring the latest buzz words to pander for votes and protesting oil&gas, pipelines.

Now she is exploring a refinery for Alberta. It is great seeing adults come to grips with reality.

2081 2018-12-11 20:29:24 Yes, that's quite true. In fact, the "oil bubble" is about to break very soon. Fossil fuels are no longer usable, and we must change our ways to survive. If not, we won't. Simple as that.
2082 2018-12-11 20:29:23 I ran out of oil making latkes today.

2084 2018-12-11 20:29:10 Cherry picking pieces of evidence that support your position, that comes in the form of innuendo that you refuse to explicitly state, is not context. Full context would lead to obvious conclusion that the oil and gas industry was trying to prevent O'Roark's election.
2085 2018-12-11 20:29:08 Over £30 billion in North seas oil revenues?...(Lie).
2086 2018-12-11 20:28:57 The other night at the bar I looked over & saw an oil pen on the floor. Asked the only other couple in the bar if it was theirs, it wasn’t. So now I have two oil pens. And I’m on my way to Boston just casually hitting them both at the same time. It’s about to be a daaayyy 
2087 2018-12-11 20:28:47 Definitely recommend trying cbd oil for pets, it's really effective for anxiety and stress for dogs!!

2092 2018-12-11 20:28:25 Great idea!! Definitely also recommend trying cbd oil for pets, it's really effective for anxiety and stress for dogs!!!

Under PDP 112 million people were living under extreme poverty in 2012 when oil was selling for over 100 dollars per barrel

2099 2018-12-11 20:28:08 Where can I buy citronella oil and skin so soft in Puerto Rico. In large quantities???
2100 2018-12-11 20:28:06 Yes the consommation was halved in france over a 30year period but with the prices increasing 7x. But that's a lifestyle choice. You don't have a choice when it come to using oil to go to work. Electrical cars are a joke.
2101 2018-12-11 20:28:04 This weather has my skin so dry  i am not use to this man. I already ordered a new facial exfoliant and i need to order more almond oil 
2102 2018-12-11 20:28:02 I used Argan oil today for the first time ever and i accidentally poured a bunch so now my hair looks greasy LOL
2103 2018-12-11 20:28:02 How much will cost taxpayers to keep a small number employed while making billions for foreign oil companies
2104 2018-12-11 20:27:44 Have u tried peppermint oil
2105 2018-12-11 20:27:43 This anti-Zimmer stuff is getting old. Flip was a terrible play caller. The offense ran like an engine with no oil all year. Outside the rams game
2106 2018-12-11 20:27:41 The new money epidemic that started with the more recent oil booms (*cough cough Bush Family cough*) stripped away the actual charm of our region and made it a WASPy shell of what it was.

2110 2018-12-11 20:27:22 Definitely recommend trying cbd oil for pets, it's really effective for anxiety and stress for dogs and probably much cheaper than that vest 
2111 2018-12-11 20:27:20 I’m quite aware what pays equalization, however a PST would have left and keep Alberta in far better shape and help lessen the impact of the busy-cycles. It’s that entitlement that is leaving us behind in these times. At some point people need to stop counting on oil to save us.
2112 2018-12-11 20:27:11 I should also add I am not Anti-Oil. 

I travel to Vancouver and someone tells me “all Albertan’s are eco terrorists” meanwhile that person drives a carbon using car and oil related products but gets to walk by a living wall everyday is aggravating. I definitely debate them.

2124 2018-12-11 20:25:52 Exfoliate weekly 
Exfoliation makes your skin softer by removing dirt, oil, and dead skin cells. You can scrub your face with coffee grounds mixed with some mild soap, or a store-bought exfoliation product.
2125 2018-12-11 20:25:46 Bamboo is very fast growing and therefor there’s no need to create whole new areas for it like the palm industry does currently (interesting article on palm oil in the national geographic this month). Hope this helps, Team Brösh

2130 2018-12-11 20:25:19 I saw that table before and remember it was disputed as it wasn't complete. It also omits the oil and gas industry in the Scottish figure but includes it in the UK figure. All UK gov figures do this.

2132 2018-12-11 20:25:02 Wash properly
Moisture loss and removing your skin’s natural oils can lead to dry and flaky skin, and bathing too often, bathing for too long, and using hot water can all increase moisture and oil loss.
2133 2018-12-11 20:24:57 If I remember correctly (please, Art Conservation Twitter, jump and correct me if I'm wrong), putting oil paintings under glass isn't a good idea because they need to be able to off-gas? But double-check me on that, because I'm unsure I'm remembering it right.
2134 2018-12-11 20:24:55 What you are getting up to is removing vegan food from your stores and replacing palm oil with lard, increasing animal abuse and destroying the environment quicker. My family won't be shopping with your unethical stores.
2135 2018-12-11 20:24:55 Although the oil field has hired people from out of state, there are still plenty of people who work there from local areas. And the oil is most definitely not shut down considering I have 3 members of my family alone working on the oil field currently while living in Williston
2136 2018-12-11 20:24:53 One small factor:  the GOP is a breeding swamp for misogynistic, cruel, racist, lying jerks who’d steamroll over their own mothers to gain political power & some fine PAC money from corrupt sources like Big Oil & the NRA. 
But I’m just spitballing here.
2137 2018-12-11 20:24:50 Wonder who did this ..... oil and water don’t mix
2138 2018-12-11 20:24:45 Floury pots like Maris piper, par boil with plenty of salt until they’re just softening, drain and give a good shake, they’ll break up but that’s ok (happens to the best of us). Use rapeseed oil, liberally, more seasoning, toss the potatoes well and cool until lovely and crispy!

2145 2018-12-11 20:24:16 You see why people  dey fight for restructuring?katsina state enter patnership for mining but delta nor fit enter for drilling  their crude oil. Which  can wayo be this?
2146 2018-12-11 20:24:10 These things just come down to personal tastes. I don't really like fighting and think if you like it, good for you. I don't like pickles, I like pineapple on pizza, peanut butter and mayo can go together because mayo is basically just eggy oil and can create a creamy experience.
2147 2018-12-11 20:24:08 Let's read that again shall we? "The United States last week exported more crude oil and fuel than it imported for the first time on record" (the clue is in IMPORTED) 
2148 2018-12-11 20:24:01 rejected the chance to learn from the Sensei for some qatari oil pesos like some common street whore while dembouz still wants to join Mr.Wenger's not-so-tricky Gunners

Hope this helps 
2149 2018-12-11 20:23:53 they can't even afford oil changes on it anyway, let me save them
2150 2018-12-11 20:23:46 Maybe they're just people who happen to also work for an oil company and their profession isn't the only thing that defines them.
2151 2018-12-11 20:23:36 hey were not you the same guy who commented in another Vijay fan's tweet here about working oil field.. I remember I saw something like that..guess it's a female Vijay fan
2152 2018-12-11 20:23:27 I’ll never forget when I told twitter this mechanic wanted me to fuck or pay $600 for a damn oil change. And niggas said “so?” ... That’s how normal it is for y’all to beg for pussy.

2158 2018-12-11 20:23:04 Hey that's what's going on in Golan Heights except they haven't taken that oil yet.
2159 2018-12-11 20:22:49 A feminist foreign affairs policy? How does that reconcile with our dependence on Saudi oil and our sales of military equipment to them?
2160 2018-12-11 20:22:38 3. If by energy you are talking about US now being the number one producer of oil, that didn't happen in the last 2 yrs. The BPD of oil has increased each yr for the past 6 yrs, due to fracking, which is adding to pollution of our air and water exponentially

2166 2018-12-11 20:22:17 Mine is also a 2006 with 100K miles.. The only thing i have ever had done is Regular Oil, Passenger side Exhaust manifold (known issue for the 5.4 Triton popping those bolts) Serpentine belt and tensioners.. Sooner or later i am getting new exhaust front to back
2167 2018-12-11 20:22:12 How proud we should be our country is run by Big Oil, pharmaceutical companies, and the Wall Street scum none of which went to prison during that Fiasco and a dictator loving person in the White House, swell, what a bright future we have.
2168 2018-12-11 20:22:02 Una estación de servicio que tenga gas oíl???
2169 2018-12-11 20:21:46 The federal govt bought one pipeline and is building another. Provincial govt is buying railcars and building refineries. To shut down the oil sands is really taking some 3D chess.  #cdnpoli #adndp #abpoli
2170 2018-12-11 20:21:42 It's the gross oil. Gross.
2171 2018-12-11 20:21:30 I need to learn how to check/put  my own oil already
2172 2018-12-11 20:21:16 《オリーブ油豆知識》

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
2173 2018-12-11 20:21:15 Oh but if you only tasted from the plate he holds in left hand....garlic and oil....YUM!!
2174 2018-12-11 20:21:14 OKAY so I got a coupon for a free oil change which is INCREDIBLE because my lights been on and i can't afford it so I was feeling #blessed BUT I got to the car place and my car started SMOKING and my radiator has a leak this is a metaphor
2175 2018-12-11 20:21:10 Wait, what? Reducing CO2 emissions will kill poor people? Wind turbines will destroy the environment? Have you tried subsisting in the oil spill rich coastlines and over polluted refinery towns? The exacerbated health issues and birth defects are quite admirable.
2176 2018-12-11 20:21:07 We need to do this to get the price done on non-THC hemp oil. It is so expensive. #Hemp
2177 2018-12-11 20:21:02 Getting an oil change at NAPA
2178 2018-12-11 20:21:00 I am not pro-Oil myself but I think the transition is harder than people think. If we are using oil I also think logistics for what is used should be in place.
2179 2018-12-11 20:20:59 I'll send soon. Yet to do your oil though.
2180 2018-12-11 20:20:56 This fucking pub puts truffle oil on cheesy chips. Jesus fuck. #COYS
2181 2018-12-11 20:20:55 With the exception of very few, they are all privileged white kids who are trying to advance an impossible agenda. Not everyone will have good paying jobs, they can't change the weather/climate, even if it is "free" health care cost money, and big oil will never change.
2182 2018-12-11 20:20:49 Use arnica oil and gel
2183 2018-12-11 20:20:47 I remember being 15 years old and working as a fry cook at KFC. We had an entire container of gangrene chicken. Like a normal human being, I was going to throw it out. I got yelled at by my supervisor who told me "the oil kills everything"

Enjoy the "halal" chicken 
2184 2018-12-11 20:20:32 In Australia we have untold wealth in mineral gas oil resources
There should be no taxes or debt. Everything paid for by mining exports-but our resources are given away practically for free- under Globalist orders esp the British who would go under without Australia #qanon
2185 2018-12-11 20:20:27 Yes very good : dried beans and chicory boiled and sauteeed with olive oil . 
2186 2018-12-11 20:20:09 Then you need to try Cali oil and wax  I haven’t rolled up a thing SINCE, way too potent lol
2187 2018-12-11 20:19:37 Getting ads for these jelly belly "Beanboozled" where it's a mystery whether you'll get a normal, shitty flavor or an intentionally shitty flavor. 

"Perfect stocking stuffer"
Thanks for the motor oil flavored jellybean, father.
2188 2018-12-11 20:19:29 @Oil_Drop Tulowitzki's gone. Had to happen, but solid vets help in many ways and Blue Jays need a lot of help. Where is seasoned crew coming from if Martin also moves?
2189 2018-12-11 20:19:13 Find it hard to believe nobody in the school noticed this. I do find it believable nobody wanted to step in and get involved, where doing so could cause you problems and possibly your job. What are our values anymore where ppl dont do right thing out of fear
2190 2018-12-11 20:19:05 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
2191 2018-12-11 20:18:58 I saw a documentary where penguins walked up a ramp into a squishing machine to make penguin oil which was all the rage in Victorian times!!! I've never forgotten it, they nearly wiped them out!!! Honest, I swear!
2192 2018-12-11 20:18:55 Because the longer you talk to him, the less time he has to talk to somebody who'll actually vote for cleaner fuel than the oil under ANWR.
2193 2018-12-11 20:18:52 NuScale reactors are 20 meters high. They could fit into a cargo ship or oil tanker but I was thinking it would be a squeeze to fit it into a frigate. Type 26 has a 20 meter beam. I was thinking frigates would be good for nuclear propulsion. Maybe one reactor with diesel backup.
2194 2018-12-11 20:18:22 #trade Global stocks lose steam after Trump shutdown threat, oil climbs

2195 2018-12-11 20:18:11 Or some thyme/thyme oil? When you fill a bowl with hot water, put some thyme oil in it and keep your head above with a towel around (like hotboxing). Then take deep breaths through the nose and stay like that for a few min. Clears the nose and throat pretty well.
2196 2018-12-11 20:18:10 Tfw you’re getting an oil change and the lady doing it sees your furry lanyard hanging on the mirror
2197 2018-12-11 20:18:10 came to get my oil changed...at the wrong place #happyTuesday 
2198 2018-12-11 20:18:09 And people wonder why women prolong getting their oil changed  IM EITHER PATRONIZED OR HARASSED can I get a women-owned and operated car shop pls?
2199 2018-12-11 20:18:08 Trudeau unnecessarily used our tax $ to buy an operating pipeline. Did nothing to add oil delivery capacity.  Then used a ridiculous court ruling to stall expansion.  His way of ducking using powers feds have to push past province /Horgan.
2200 2018-12-11 20:17:56 $HBAN and $KEY are my favorite Regionals.  I love $LYB and have been adding.  Trades with oil but they've bought back 1/3rd of their Shares
2201 2018-12-11 20:17:52 Best potatoes for roasties? With Olive oil or Veg oil ?
2202 2018-12-11 20:17:46 @TRwinchester Really enjoyed Beauty and the Beast with my class today but please could someone oil the seats! Squeak squeak 
2203 2018-12-11 20:17:35 People don't have to look to far in the past to see that other industry leaders have already pursued and cancelled (Voyageur Upgrader). Better return and higher demand for exporting Oil.
2204 2018-12-11 20:17:32 Im living off of my 4% oil life in my car
2205 2018-12-11 20:17:07 since slowly switching from prescriptions to #CBD oil I can finally see a light at the end of the tunnel. sooooo thankful it’s not even funny.
2206 2018-12-11 20:16:45 Did the Federal Government create these wetlands, or did they maybe exist before the Feds mandated a permit before visiting them? It's not like it's going to be legal to dump a barrel of oil in a swamp now.
2207 2018-12-11 20:16:39 Moose isn’t on any other medications, so I’m willing to spend a little more on quality oil right now if it’ll help! I just want him to be able to live a normal puppy life. Whoever had him for the first year of his life didn’t do him any favors. 
2208 2018-12-11 20:16:37 Improves taste and texture because it gets rid of moisture before you add the oil 
2209 2018-12-11 20:16:35 Louisiana ranks #48 in #fiscal stability, #49 in education and the @USCG is cleaning up an oil spill in Rattlesnake Bayou as we speak. And, instead of his focus being there, he would rather spread misinformation. #Focus #IntegrityInitiative
2210 2018-12-11 20:16:26 On BNN TV Jan 2013 i declared Canada needs to wake up and smell the coffee - US doesn't need our oil anymore. And to buy US refinery stocks. 5 years hence this is even more apparent. It's hard to remember there was a refinery in Oakville On and east end Montreal. Small and closed
2211 2018-12-11 20:16:23 A bottle of olive oil
2212 2018-12-11 20:16:19 I’m sitting here getting my oil changed. Someone tell me a joke
2213 2018-12-11 20:16:18 Oil prices rose, recovering some of the previous session’s losses with the help of gains in global stocks, a slightly weaker dollar and an outage hurting Libyan production
2214 2018-12-11 20:16:13 Not at all actually most of the people I work with are making 90-100k a year working on forklifts, all of our managers used to be techs and they all make over 120k a year so I’d do some research. I have a lot of friends in the oil fields making even more so not unreasonable.
2215 2018-12-11 20:16:06 I got "burnt edge transits" from doing cabal oil and personal touch, not "vanilla blades"
2216 2018-12-11 20:15:58 And I have no interest in actions that dont actually help. I'm all for transitioning away from Oil asap, but I don't see how changing the source of oil (Saudi/Fracking/Alberta) actually helps.
Maybe I'm underrating the inertia of building more oil infrastructure.
2217 2018-12-11 20:15:57 Walmart better hurry up with this oil change before I report all of these health code violations
2218 2018-12-11 20:15:51 Not a good analogy. Oil is expensive because it's limited. Data is unfortunately everywhere, up for grabs even by the most inexperienced "attackers"
2219 2018-12-11 20:15:32 最近はお店を転々としていることが多い

2228 2018-12-11 20:14:49 This R&B conversation has been going on for 3 full days now. Y’all really let this car running out of motor oil voiced nigga do this shit to y’all!?
2229 2018-12-11 20:14:47 idek oil is important bcoz our teacher wasted days on it
2230 2018-12-11 20:14:32 SAI BABA!! SAI OSIN!! The haters and their coterie of jesters can say whatever they like, from what we see,you are on the right track. For another quarter,oil is not the major driver of our GDP growth. Shows your policies are working and can work better. Good!!
2231 2018-12-11 20:14:25 What about the other renewables oil gas coal?
2232 2018-12-11 20:14:06 Just like all of his so called promises, LIES, to get elected! To hear himself boast & walk around like an overgrown peacock! I’m proud to say I DIDN’T VOTE for this con man! The people who bought that poisonous snake oil he was selling should hang their heads! @realDonaldTrump
2233 2018-12-11 20:14:06 Because the new problem is the changing outlook for the rate of demand growth, a single month's data on China's oil imports is not the relative metric. It's not dispositive. The big change taking place is China's petrol demand outlook, in context of abundant global capacity.

2237 2018-12-11 20:13:30 The narrative of the person experiencing the pain is of utmost importance. We can't underestimate the despair that people with back pain can be in hence why snake oil merchants offering a simple solution is an enticing prospect
2238 2018-12-11 20:13:26 Niggas cut their hair twice a month and that’s 160-200. Excluding oil sheen , and hair products/ pomade
2239 2018-12-11 20:13:26 Your Mac is just revving it’s engine , that or it developed a cat complex or dog, anyway that’s my IT diagnosis so get it an oil change and scratch post to be safe
2240 2018-12-11 20:13:20 That's right.

'This', is it.

Now what will you do?

The staircase to heaven is covered in olive oil, 'watch' your step...
2241 2018-12-11 20:13:17 You know your stuff! A great way to enjoy jamon is with fresh tomatoes, on top of a slice of baguette, with some nice olive oil drizzled over. Pinch of salt, and you're good to go! Let your friend know she can find us at support@carnivoreclub.co!
2242 2018-12-11 20:13:11 Productive day at work, got an eye exam & new glasses, & now getting an oil change.. pretty solid day thus far 
2243 2018-12-11 20:13:09 Chicken legs
Mix salt and pepper together and coat the chicken evenly and completely by hand. Take rosemary prob 4 pieces, garlic roughly chopped, on a foiled pan with olive oil bake for about 1-2 hrs At 475 degrees. Then when it's done squeeze lil lemon juice and boom
2244 2018-12-11 20:13:02 That's great Labour wants to destroy a new industry which has made the US self sufficient in oil and gas.

I find it bizzare how Labour had learnt nothing from Paris riots and still committed to punative green energy costs.
2245 2018-12-11 20:12:59 I may try the CBD oil if mine gets any worse. Some medications they give to treat it can damage your heart. Even if my MR thinks I'm heartless at times, I still need mine, so that medication isn't optional. One of my nephews was diagnosed with it at age 22. It may be genetic.
2246 2018-12-11 20:12:54 Quebec wants another 1.7 billion in equalization payments next year and won’t allow a pipeline through to get oil to the east. That’s all anyone needs to know.
2247 2018-12-11 20:12:42 Defend the peace that masses of oil can bring when the criminal US regime seeks to steal it. To do this they wage an economic war which like everywhere else including USA is cast into austerity. Defend it against brainless idiots like you who have swallowed all you are fed.

2255 2018-12-11 20:11:15 Distance is a problem but surely Canada has most to plunder. And we've done it before, maybe some of those troops could oil their muskets and form the vanguard.
2256 2018-12-11 20:11:14 Have you looked into cbd oil? It should help with your seizures though not too sure about what it would do for what I’m assuming to be narcolepsy?
2257 2018-12-11 20:11:06 wait no cheesesteak hoags gets oil and vinegar like a hoagie mayo is for club sandwiches
2258 2018-12-11 20:11:06 Maybe she has evolved? Just wait till May when she hates oil n pipelines again.
2259 2018-12-11 20:11:02 It's a plastic butt protip btw XP you can use steam, but I feel electric oil heater is way safer/more effective...and less hold. Just sit and walk away bahaha.

2267 2018-12-11 20:10:24 I am not sure how Alberta transitions from an Oil based economy but saying that we can't is not going to be helpful moving forward. This move needs to be done now and moving forward, it would likely better to start sooner rather than later.

2269 2018-12-11 20:10:14 This social justice BS is a factor IMO. It's all based on us against them along the entire socioeconomic spectrum including climate and environmentalism. These " others" must be despised and hated, if you dont, you're one of them. Really sad.

2277 2018-12-11 20:09:52 Extremely. Our military is getting stronger. European citizens are getting bolder. America is largest oil producer. Gas is cheaper. Unemployment is down. Amazing.....why are you so sad?

2280 2018-12-11 20:09:20 Oil industry owes every citizen of the world an apology.
2281 2018-12-11 20:09:18 I think the France riots are for cheaper oil ... not climate!!
2282 2018-12-11 20:09:01 "i need to invite emma chamberlain over here to add some oil"
2283 2018-12-11 20:08:45 Awesome. :) I sent her your tweet. She asked me the best way to eat jamon and I just said high end olive oil with manchego and olives but what do you recommend?
2284 2018-12-11 20:08:40 Don't they produce enough oil?

Fucking hell.

2287 2018-12-11 20:08:19 Motor oil. 
2288 2018-12-11 20:08:16 The best business in the world is a well-run oil company. The second best in the world is a badly run oil company.
2289 2018-12-11 20:08:01 Excellent. The oil painting by Harold Steggles was his wedding present to his sister Phyllis when she got married in 1940. Her husband Reg was in the Royal Electrical & Mechanical Engineers & he was posted to Egypt after their wedding & they didn't see each again until 1946!!
2290 2018-12-11 20:07:51 Didn't Trudeau just paid billion to purchase the pipeline project, so he will be able to ship oil to China, and increase prices to Canadian buyers?!
2291 2018-12-11 20:07:50 CBD Oil out there curing cancer and shit but won’t budge my cold. Lies have been told!
2292 2018-12-11 20:07:34 bin, c'est qu'est-ce que je dis : se mettre en ordre avec la réalité et ses incertitudes avant de confronter les opinions
2293 2018-12-11 20:07:31 At least once a week I apply coconut oil to my hair before I shampoo it. Then I condition as normal. Coconut oil is my favorite go to for hair and skin. Plus! It's really great for baking too. 
2294 2018-12-11 20:07:17 Give us back our shoes!!
Shoes for oil.
2295 2018-12-11 20:07:14 Shouldn't excuse? Seriously? So we should shame people that don't know how to write good English?
Now, how will that be of help?
2296 2018-12-11 20:07:06 Have any of these geniuses assembled a coherent theory on why oil and gas executives would favor Beto over Ted Cruz?
2297 2018-12-11 20:07:06 These are the young lives we send off to fight our oil wars for rent check white men.
2298 2018-12-11 20:07:05 People in Walmart (waiting for my oil change) talking about church while Im just over here being a ho I love my life.
2299 2018-12-11 20:07:04 Damn. I mean they can flavor the oil as well, so it's really up to personal preference. Grissom is super picky (only eats dry food or treats-all medicines have to be shot down his throat). I just looked it up and it's Wood Dale Pet Pharmacy. It's pricey, but definitely worth it!
2300 2018-12-11 20:06:42 I hear you. If you don’t cook from scratch it’s impossible. Do what you can with your food choices. Olive or avocado oil instead of margarine for example. Every little bit adds up :)
2301 2018-12-11 20:06:40 I need to go get an oil change suggestions??
2302 2018-12-11 20:06:38 See where the world is going and your still budgeting on oil barrels, no vision,
2303 2018-12-11 20:06:34 #ukog hit 150m mcap last time on oil flow,

#frr not yet flowing was 100m plus mcap (now down due to court case)

and

 #ANGS only 47m mcap despite about to produce and generate revenue (yes, Angs the only one with production licence in HH). Should hav higher mcap than ukog soon.
2304 2018-12-11 20:06:31 ...our engineers undertake risk assessments with any work they start, but my knowledge of oil insulated cabling is minimal so I'm going to forward this to the area management to confirm everything was completed as it was supposed to be. Rob
2305 2018-12-11 20:06:29 Oh, you again  Now Oil companies are blaming Liberals for wanting to be healthy. You all should go to jail for the crap you spread and the damage you do.
2306 2018-12-11 20:06:19 Hi. I can confirm that these are our works. A high voltage, oil insulated cable was leaking and this excavation was made for the repairs. These should have been completed by today, and the excavation is due to be reinstated by the 13th, so this should be gone soon. Of course...
2307 2018-12-11 20:06:14 You people piss me off and he's doing a good job we're selling our oil instead of buying it what do you think about that
2308 2018-12-11 20:06:08 Yawn. "MMT snake oil will save us". Whatever way you look at it Brexit means a net loss of taxes, wages and pensions. Print all you like. Borrow all you like. Binning Brexit means we will have tens of billions more to spend in wages, pensions and services.
2309 2018-12-11 20:06:04 What essential oil attracts a sugar daddy?
2310 2018-12-11 20:05:58 This has nothing whatsoever to do with North Sea oil, which will be exhausted in 20 years anyway. And as for fracking, you can't destroy an industry that doesn't yet exist.
2311 2018-12-11 20:05:57 I use there beard care oil and cream and its amazing. You can find it at Target
2312 2018-12-11 20:05:56 I’m doing both those plus I’m taking cod liver oil capsules for my poor old joints.
2313 2018-12-11 20:05:55 A hit dog will holler.  A yellow dog all the more.
2314 2018-12-11 20:05:55 Yes! I'm borrowing this one
2315 2018-12-11 20:05:52 If you take the coming climate crisis seriously, supporting a dude who signed a pledge not to take money from oil & gas industry (taking the credit) then takes the money on the slide doesn't seem the smartest bet.
2316 2018-12-11 20:05:50 First off: Learn to use a search engine. Any child can look up that #Quebec refineries gets most of their oil from #Alberta and #Texas via #Michigan. The main importer of #SaudiOil in Canada is @irvingoil, at their #NewBrunswick facility.
2317 2018-12-11 20:05:48 So true. Obviously he missed the lessons from past presidents. We’d otherwise have stopped North Korea from firing missiles and performing nuke tests.  China/US trade imbalance would be zero, and our oil production would be net exporting. Simply use Obama as an example.

2321 2018-12-11 20:05:09 Did John D. Rockefeller build Standard Oil with the intention of selling it? 

Did Baron de Rothschild build De Rothschild Freres so that he could later sell it?
2322 2018-12-11 20:05:08 REX TILLERSON equated life in the "highly disciplined" Exxon-Mobil to one in the US military; 1)This man grew up in a priviledged life not unlike that of Donald Trump; 2) NO US soldier's paid $150,000 a month to work a desk; 3) oil corps don't send people into live-fire combat.
2323 2018-12-11 20:05:03 And again rusia.. why? It’s All about the Oil. A country devastated by comunist goverment, no food, no medicines, and look at putin-maduro big smile. Those are allies with trump. Total Caos.
2324 2018-12-11 20:05:00 Modernist architecture is like oil painting: you get some masterpieces and some disasters. This was an architectural slap in the face. The addition to the Strathcona Library, on the other hand, was done very sympathetically.
2325 2018-12-11 20:04:59 Those two alliances (oil&gas + Israel) would’ve meant more status quo from the senate…
2326 2018-12-11 20:04:54 Claremorris always pretty competitive, Hillside or Jones Oil at train station especially. It's crazy the difference even a few miles away.
2327 2018-12-11 20:04:52 $20 dollar oil...California will still be $3.50 a gallon.
2328 2018-12-11 20:04:47 Is that avocado oil for dressing or drinking?

2331 2018-12-11 20:04:16 The oil sands is heated with steam so it flows better.  The water to make the steam is recycled. 

That's just FYI. I'm not trying to change your mind if you prefer oil products from other countries that's your choice as a consumer.
2332 2018-12-11 20:04:08 I just placed my first order with your company and look forward to trying your products!  CBD oil has really been a great thing in my life and I’ve heard good words about you guys.  Thanks for this offer!
2333 2018-12-11 20:04:06 @JustinTrudeau are you that fucking stupid that you would increase Quebec’s equalization payments by 11 percent to over 13 billion dollars when they have a surplus budget and are rejecting Alberta pipeline but instead buy dirtier oil from Venezuela,Iran iraq etc
2334 2018-12-11 20:04:04 Yes but not on Tsetse fly, however, PG was Parasitology with research on Antihelmenthes activity of extracts of Nigerian medicinal plants. Did lot of work on anti parasitic plants and leaves extracts of C. papaya showed certain activity that is why iam interested in the seed oil.
2335 2018-12-11 20:04:03 Gimme those dnb tunes with the smouldering jazz drums, steamy vibes, and then a synth that comes in like a wasp farting on an oil slick
2336 2018-12-11 20:03:51 Niggas think they slick but bitch I’m baby oil 
2337 2018-12-11 20:03:45 Well will be perforated within next 2 days and let's see if oil flows from Kimmeridge at brockham #ANGS
2338 2018-12-11 20:03:38 Oil prices also plummeted shortly before the Great Depression. The same is happening to oil as well. Trumponomics have been devastating for the world except Russia.
2339 2018-12-11 20:03:25 As long as all these people if guilty be brought to book.Jailtime and assets taken to pay back money.  For South Africans. One remembers the oil that was also sold because it was old at dirt cheap price. That ANC aunty also took early retirement.All this must be investigated.
2340 2018-12-11 20:03:16 On Friday, @francoislegault compared Quebec's "clean" hydro to Alberta's "dirty" oil. @RachelNotley responded today:

It is very frustrating. There is a high level of hypocrisy [...] I would say to the new premier of Quebec is... He needs to get off his high horse.... 1/2
2341 2018-12-11 20:03:12 Use a spoolie to coat your lashes in Black Jamaican castor oil. Thank me later 
2342 2018-12-11 20:03:07 Reducing the production volume of oil by OPEC+ in order to increase it's price, I don't think is the solution

When you keep oil in the ground and the price rises astronomically, it will make the buyers to look for alternative to oil
2343 2018-12-11 20:03:06 Great Britain will pay some way that's sure, as we the European Union initiate a global ice age that will follow the 'Green Spring' as I call it, green as for environmentally friendly. We must show no mercy and act together as a Union to boycot oil, gas and severly limit CO2!
2344 2018-12-11 20:03:05 Can't wait to go home and cook myself palm oil riceit's been five whole months
2345 2018-12-11 20:02:57 I need to get CBD oil for my dad (he’s still in an assisted living with terrible back pain since his accident a few years back - some of you probably remember). So WHERE do I get it? What are the rules now? Can I have it shipped from MI? Is that illegal? #CBDoil #StupidOhio
2346 2018-12-11 20:02:53 And haven’t done a thing with any of them balls. Hal is a snake oil salesman scamming Yankee fans. He won’t open his wallet for any top FA, wait and see.

2353 2018-12-11 20:01:59 Guys let’s confuse the girls real quick.. 
Oil change 
2354 2018-12-11 20:01:57 That tax will go no where, we are in huge deficit, cause Liberals can't manage money. Look what they did with Canadian Oil, once Canada's power, now Alberta is going bankrupt. Trudeau also lost on every trade agreement he signed.
2355 2018-12-11 20:01:48 it depends on the SNP objectives, if it's independence then I can't see them going for it, if it's republican devolution I know Mcdonnell is a republican so perhaps but SNP changed it's stance long ago and the snake oil salesman tactics sturgeon put in today certainly wont help.
2356 2018-12-11 20:01:47 esa AN ha sido bufa y sirve porque paises como gran bretaña se agarran para no devolver el oro pero si fuera por la mayoria de ese bagazo de asamblea entregan el oro como han entregado tantas cosas
2357 2018-12-11 20:01:37 IF it were up to me, half the stock of every oil company would be owned by a trust (but would be non-voting), and that trust would disburse its dividends to some public good. Renewable energy would be a good use.
2358 2018-12-11 20:01:10 How do you propose we get the oil to Quebec?
2359 2018-12-11 20:01:03 Palm oil kills orangutans and their natural habitat. 
2360 2018-12-11 20:01:03 Hopefully her oil light will come on...
2361 2018-12-11 20:00:57 Lol baba mi. The one I just ate now has plenty oil in it and they said it is fried chicken. The one that has shuku shuku for body is roasted
2362 2018-12-11 20:00:56 omg do u actually wanna know... cuz it's not the pot that catches fire; when he puts the fries in u can see the oil overflows a couple seconds after and and oil, even cooking oil, is super flammable so u never want to let it overflow like that
2363 2018-12-11 20:00:46 Doesn't really matter what its called... The black goo that they need to wash with clean water to extract oil. (I can call it oil sand if yoy want.)

2368 2018-12-11 20:00:14 That's a good question - I don't know (and I don't know if Sinopec's budget is publicly available). 

To be clear - I support oil profits going to renewable energy research. But nationalizing the companies doesn't necessarily advance that goal
2369 2018-12-11 20:00:14 I suffer so much from anxiety, and the subsequent body aches that come with it. 
I tried some cbd vape oil and it really helped with my fight or flight response. I cant wait to dive into it more.

2380 2018-12-11 19:59:17 No he doesn't. Many individual people who work in the oil and gas industry gave him donations and the oil and gas industry is huge in Texas.
2381 2018-12-11 19:59:17 Why isn’t @RickSantorum on this list. Big lobbyists for oil and coal. Totally against climate change.
2382 2018-12-11 19:59:15 Y’all remember when Marge Simpson showed her tits in Playboy?
2383 2018-12-11 19:59:14 Oil prices change due to market trends and projected influence. It's an educated guess by so called Experts.

2385 2018-12-11 19:59:10 Put a little baby oil on 2 minutes before getting out of the shower. The smell will rinse away, but your skin will be extremely soft all day
2386 2018-12-11 19:59:06 so the snake oil salesmen keep saying without appreciating their own irony
2387 2018-12-11 19:59:04 Definitely let me know, that’d be great! I’ve heard from a few people in my reactive/anxious dog FB group that sometimes the plain oil helps more than chews, but it might be easier to start him on the chews and go from there. Poor dude has general anxiety that escalates badly. 
2388 2018-12-11 19:59:04 yes, I dont remember the brand, but it was like an organic one NOT with palm oil
2389 2018-12-11 19:59:02 Went a lil over what they told me for next oil change

2390 2018-12-11 19:59:01 I thought we were all singing kumbaya around a burning barrel of bitumen since all the parties were on the same side re: oil production cut.

2402 2018-12-11 19:57:35 Why is this stumble bum simpleton meeting Saudis?... duh ....yeah we know they have oil....and sand ....and money.....and bone saws....and trump in their pocket what else is new?
2403 2018-12-11 19:57:33 By building our own trains, planes, roads, powerplants, etc. Its been done before. This country developed its own nuclear capability, pioneered open heart surgery and was the first to produce synthetic coal from oil. Why should we suddenly be limited?
2404 2018-12-11 19:57:27 I meant oil I oil my scalp I don’t put it directly in my hair.. I do have dry scalp, so what am I supposed to do for it?
2405 2018-12-11 19:57:17 @francoislegault if you don’t like Alberta’s dirty oil money, don’t accept your equalization payments from the Federal government ! In fact maybe you should refund your equalization payments from 1936 onwards because they too are tainted with Alberta’s dirty oil money !
2406 2018-12-11 19:57:04 skin: is dry

2410 2018-12-11 19:56:47 Biz you sound exactly like Trudeau.
Your contempt for Alberta is astounding and totally predictable.
You would rather get your oil from the Islamic extremist Saudis who by the way are sitting on a sea of oil 4 ft. Below their feet
2411 2018-12-11 19:56:45 also, they can mail it directly to you and they always send Grissom a lil toy in the mail with his oil :)
2412 2018-12-11 19:56:45 Kellyanne Conway, if paid enough, would claim that motor oil tastes like chocolate sauce.
2413 2018-12-11 19:56:42 No need to imagine. If I recall correctly may or June oil straddle atm is around 12
2414 2018-12-11 19:56:32 The Bush Family = Above the law, oil drunk murders of the Middle Eastern poor
2415 2018-12-11 19:56:31 Because the Mexican government is corrupt
They won’t help their own people, although it has vast oil reserves, rich farmland, vineyards and tourist worthy beaches #Mexico #corruption
2416 2018-12-11 19:56:24 CBD oil tastes like clove oil  well Buckley's cures a cold, let's home this works for my cramps. — feeling gross
2417 2018-12-11 19:56:23 Why do you assume we are keyboard/Google jockeys? I've founded & built two oil exploration companies (alongside other stuff I do), others here are scientific researchers (field & lab). It tends to be the deniers who are the couch jockeys, mainly absorbing & repeating misinfo.
2418 2018-12-11 19:56:15 A lot more yap yap, unless @RachelNotley is willing to fire Topp, get the anti oil people out of her party and agree that our only solution is likely separation she is just another gutless politician, Alberta needs a leader, I hope one comes along before it is too late
2419 2018-12-11 19:56:11 Great so why don't you go around saying oil isn't vegan? Why focus on the one than has the lowest land footprint?
2420 2018-12-11 19:56:07 News that is Late to the Show again. Venezuela has been participating in the games with Russia for the past 10 year. Each summer a team is there, as are many Socialist Countries. Venezuela followed Iraq's lead & took their oil away from the dollar. That is what it is all about.
2421 2018-12-11 19:56:05 @davidsirota Oil execs are creating a climate crisis? Aren’t they just providing the supply for the demand? You drive cars that burn gasoline, so there’s demand, and they provide that gasoline to you. 

Aren’t *you* creating the climate crisis by driving gasoline powered cars?
2422 2018-12-11 19:56:02 Is there Cooking oil?
2423 2018-12-11 19:56:00 It's sad when you'd rather have a used car salesman who has crimes racking up in the 100s from him and his cabinet daily then a guy you hate because he changed a few words in an anthem and isn't moving on oil as fast as you'd like.
2424 2018-12-11 19:56:00 y'all really still using juuls when portable essential oil diffusers actually give you health BENEFITS? weird flex but ok
2425 2018-12-11 19:55:47 Oil change was $65
2426 2018-12-11 19:55:46 And his administration is being sued to stop Seismic blasting on the East Coast for private oil profit.
2427 2018-12-11 19:55:45 oil change is changeing ur cars diaper ?
2428 2018-12-11 19:55:39 Did the olive oil work out then?
2429 2018-12-11 19:55:34 In actuality, lower QC unemployment comes largely from a more diverse economy, being less dependent on one industry.

AB oil workers who lose their jobs have to look abroad for something in their domain. An equivalent QC iron miner can apply locally to work w/ another mineral.
2430 2018-12-11 19:55:27 Okay I was going to try grape seed oil
2431 2018-12-11 19:55:26 I seriously need to learn how to do an oil change on my car myself.
2432 2018-12-11 19:55:22 My favourite artists. I'd never seen this before - oil on canvas or pastels?
2433 2018-12-11 19:55:20 Looks like an oil painting!  Gorgeous work!
2434 2018-12-11 19:55:14 Why is Russia responsible for Venezuela's budget?

The Russian Federation needs to assist the Venezuelans by keeping oil prices up, providing alternative trade options, rebuilding oil infrastructure to keep extraction cheap, and provide assets to keep the US out.

2442 2018-12-11 19:54:22 I’ve always said it should be allowed as an ingredient.  Water, sugar, purple, hemp oil.
2443 2018-12-11 19:54:19 We could launch our government!... Drenched in motor oil... Watch those lighters tho.. 
2444 2018-12-11 19:54:14 It will be hard in North America. Most oil is from Canada and the United States. But we will keep blaming and shaming American and Canadian corporations involved in the sales of weapons to Saudi Arabia. We will keep fighting.
2445 2018-12-11 19:54:14 choose to use that for self enrichment through oil drilling, we don't stand a chance.
2446 2018-12-11 19:54:13 It could also be rear or front main seal. Oil pan only shouldn't be bad. Main seals are different story.
2447 2018-12-11 19:54:12 I’m glad to see the NDP come around on natural resources.  Problem is, it’s all bullshit. How do you campaign against oil and gas, and then turn face and start championing it. The election can’t come soon enough.  Beat it in 2019.
2448 2018-12-11 19:54:09 Here’s an idea: let Iran, Hezbollah and Russia defeat ISIS. Not only are they much better at it, they are also officially asked by the sovereign state Syria.

You on the other hand are in Syria illegally. Give Syria back their land, oil and resources and get the h*ll out of there

the poorest country in middle east with lot of oil

2453 2018-12-11 19:53:42 I have been around enough to know how it works,Kaduna was just an instrument of destruction cause the north would have considered Ironsi a traitor but you are to naive to know that!
2454 2018-12-11 19:53:33 Came run do a oil change
2455 2018-12-11 19:53:32 Other French teams are absolutely screwed on that front. In reality, even with their oil money, Chelsea and City are only about as far ahead financially at this point as Madrid and Bayern have typically been in their leagues. Non-trivial gap, but not as big as it could be/was.
2456 2018-12-11 19:53:30 I need a face mask, scrub my skin with coconut oil & coffee grounds, long soak, and full body massage
2457 2018-12-11 19:53:29 Next horse to ride is black horse. Has pear of scales in his hand, representing famons. The wheat and barley and oil and whine it mentions. Food rationing on earth as it gets more scarce.
2458 2018-12-11 19:53:24 change your oil every 3000miles
2459 2018-12-11 19:53:22 Threat to oil production in #Libya - reports of imminent attack on oil terminals: Forces loyal to Jathran are preparing for an imminent attack on oil terminals in the oil crescent area. The forces are amassing in the Bani Walid area. LNA already mobilizing forces in response.
2460 2018-12-11 19:53:18 Actually not. Less people are married than ever before 26 to mid 30's. If finacial incentives were a factor, more would be married because pooling resources/ being married is statistically proven to result in higher net household wealth.
2461 2018-12-11 19:53:17 Greener than coal and oil, certainly. And there's been, what, two bad accidents involving nuclear energy? That's a lot less than there have been with the production of coal and oil based energy.
2462 2018-12-11 19:53:08 Is this a coincidence or what? Those are 3 of the majors oil producers in the planet earth.
2463 2018-12-11 19:52:59 Mad asf that a crack head stole my Anastasia pomade, beauty oil, and my hoola contour because that’s all exspensice so you better use that shit
2464 2018-12-11 19:52:51 Make sure your oil is changed and your tire pressure is good. Bring water and coolant
2465 2018-12-11 19:52:50 Would love to be there and help oil each boy, 
2466 2018-12-11 19:52:30 should have Alexa’s car all back together tomorrow... new brakes, new race transmission, new belts and oil change it’s like a brand new car #Nightmarelives

2474 2018-12-11 19:51:29 Get yourself some peppermint and frankincense oil, mix it, and put a few drops on your temples, base of your neck, and under your nose. Also, do small yoga stretches every hour. Love - a chronic migraine sufferer
2475 2018-12-11 19:51:17 @AlbertaatNoon popcorn lung 1st came from microwaveable popcorn and the fumes. Something to do with inhaling propylene glycol as a carrier oil i think
2476 2018-12-11 19:51:12 Trump because Gas is 1.99 a gallon and we export more oil than we import. 
2477 2018-12-11 19:51:04 Issit even nice cos same oil
2478 2018-12-11 19:51:02 That’s a bit top down, isn’t it? Why not put an oil company out of business first, and play it by ear?
2479 2018-12-11 19:50:44 I said Russia has over 50% control of Germany's energy.what do you think will happen if EU and Germany upset Russia? Russia will turn off their oil and gas.
2480 2018-12-11 19:50:33 In 2008 Nancy cut the mics and turned off the lights when the Republicans were still debating off-shore drilling to lower dependency on foreign oil and lower gas our prices.  @realDonaldTrump shut her down! Paybacks are a bitch and so is Nancy. She & Chuckles can pound sand.
2481 2018-12-11 19:50:32 Two hours for an oil change @goodyear what a joke!
2482 2018-12-11 19:50:07 @SickNotWeak anyone in Canada have recent experience with CBD oil for depression. After trying 7 different antidepressants am desperate for relief.
2483 2018-12-11 19:49:33 Is it Has or oil heating, and was heating on when bleeding it...?
2484 2018-12-11 19:49:30 #ableg #abed Maybe build the refinery in Quebec with a pledge to refine oil from Alberta/Saskatewan. (Win/Win)  How can @RachelNotley get away with saying she has increased public support for pipelines when Quebec is still opposed?
2485 2018-12-11 19:49:21 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
2486 2018-12-11 19:49:20 i love it when people tell me i have healthy hair when i wet it everyday, don’t keep it in a protective style when i take them out of braids, and only use coconut and vitamin e oil on it lmao
2487 2018-12-11 19:49:13 No blood for oil, boycott Saudi Arabia. We need $100 a bbl oil and $6-7 a gal gas....
2488 2018-12-11 19:49:06 Well Gasoline is 1.99 a gallon here because we export more Oil than import. Looks like that is a Big Win for Trumps team. 
2489 2018-12-11 19:48:56 As far as I agree with you that there hunger in the land, must people then capitalize on what could claim their lives untimely in the name of trying to solve the hunger issue? Do you know what the effect of their dog g could be ? Packing oil from drainage?
2490 2018-12-11 19:48:37 Orange oil can help keep them off shit but you have to constantly use it!
2491 2018-12-11 19:48:35 opening farming to export to China again, exporting oil, bringing jobs back to USA is bad?
Asking countries to pay their fair share and stop stealing intel. Prop is bad?

Obama did nothing in 8 yrs. It’s good crash cuz the FED needs to go BTW.

PS. Trump is STILL your President.
2492 2018-12-11 19:48:22 You know you’re becoming an adult when you ask for an oil change and a problem with your car fixed for Christmas
2493 2018-12-11 19:48:19 CongressmanCarbajal@mail.house.gov : Should we allow oil and gas drilling in the Arctic?

2495 2018-12-11 19:48:17 I don't think carbon pricing is the only thing being used to reduce oil sector emissions. Aren't the oil producers doing other technological things to do that as well?
2496 2018-12-11 19:48:16 Congress Subject Line: Should we allow oil and gas drilling in the Arctic?
2497 2018-12-11 19:48:14 Should have been done years ago under tories except they sold our souls to foreigners big oil!
2498 2018-12-11 19:48:12 What’s the moisturizing ‘method’? I mean I condition and oil often but my hair soaks everything up with ease.

2501 2018-12-11 19:47:55 My dad is taking my car to get an oil change, car wash, windows tinted & filling my tank up.. thank God for him.
2502 2018-12-11 19:47:46 That is why it's good to be good, with all his oil money, he has failed to touch the lives of kwarans who he now wants to vote for him. That kind of politics O to Ge
2503 2018-12-11 19:47:42 As long as there are rainforests to clear for palm oil you can scoff as much of this ethically sound cruelty free fodder as you like 
2504 2018-12-11 19:47:40 So I just remembered that, despite the Sick effect in Someday being inspired by a stomach ache I got from prolonged exposure to oil fumes one night, Itsuki sneezes when you press 1.
He was originally going to vomit but you know.
2505 2018-12-11 19:47:34 Ehhh. I switch it up quite often. Strains, test%, oil, Pre rolls, flower, carts..the works. Soo honestly i don't have many issues, i'm sure it could be better but, no complaints here.
2506 2018-12-11 19:47:27 Lmao just use a different oil and there are no problems! It’s not like there aren’t alternatives.
2507 2018-12-11 19:47:26 Oil is bad though 
2508 2018-12-11 19:47:24 How much is this, let me put my tea tree oil in it
2509 2018-12-11 19:47:19 my Grandad’s been taking cannabis oil for his back but my Nanny’s got confused and has gone round telling all their friends he’s on heroin hahahaha can you imagine
2510 2018-12-11 19:47:04 I agree. The @albertaNDP had to be made to do any work on health, education or continuing care. Their focus is @OilGasCanada Lots of money for oil industry. Very little for families 
@shoffmanAB @dryiu_verna @GoAHealth @AHS_media @ElderAB
2511 2018-12-11 19:46:55 SHUT UP @nationalpost  Eastern Canada doesn't care about this guy getting his head sawed off! They LOVE the Saudi Prince! They only care about buying "socially acceptable" SAUDI oil. Unless you know of ANOTHER place they could possibly get it from...
2512 2018-12-11 19:46:44 Can’t help to wonder how much these actors are paid to dress up as oilfield workers that support @albertaNDP @RachelNotley I cannot think of any oil worker who supports #ndp going to be a massive win for @Alberta_UCP
2513 2018-12-11 19:46:27 I've had that painful problem, too. There isn't a urinary diet food that I'd stay in the same room w/, forget about eating! Been grain free 11 years. Now doing very well w/ 1 fish oil capsule/day drizzled on my grain free pate @ breakfast + ½ packet Fortiflora probiotics @ night.
2514 2018-12-11 19:46:22 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
2515 2018-12-11 19:46:17 Notley said that Quebec's premier needs to look at the ground, get off his high horse, and see that Alberta oil is not dirty. Nicely put! #abpoli #AbLeg
2516 2018-12-11 19:46:17 One would think many Middle Eastern countries need a more robust oil price to fund social programs/state expenses.  Balancing act vs. demand trends, but their reality.
2517 2018-12-11 19:46:09 That's easy!  You're the oil that keeps that engine running smoothly!
2518 2018-12-11 19:46:06 Well, white people did invent TV, radio, phones, cars, airplanes, computers, turning oil into gasoline, air conditioning, vulcanization of rubber, vaccines, etc.  Great going, my fellow Caucasians.
2519 2018-12-11 19:46:02 Someone explain to me why people ask for medical advice over social media? Seriously. Call your doctor if you have questions. Don’t rely on Sally Sue’s unprofessional opinion to tell you which essential oil will cure your kids adverse reaction to a medication... yikes.
2520 2018-12-11 19:45:55 a little peppermint oil behind the ear, clear it up in a few days.
2521 2018-12-11 19:45:55 Notley firing shots at new Quebec Premier Francois Legault, who said there was no social acceptability for oil in his province. "I would say to the new premier of Quebec that he needs to get off his high horse," she says, adds that oil revenues pay for social services in Quebec.
2522 2018-12-11 19:45:42 I put some olive oil in the dishes and heated it up on 210 fan for 15 mins then poured half the mix into both and baked for 20 mins at the same temp I made the mix this morning and put it in the fridge 
2523 2018-12-11 19:45:26 50% of hydro revenues are included in the eq formula (which is the same way oil and gas revenues are treated).
2524 2018-12-11 19:45:11 I tell u guys, Canada is in a big trouble. If Chinese gov can do this, it means it will cut oil purchase in Canada. Canada is stupid. Why do this for USA? Trump admin treats Canada like a shit. USA itself doesn't have a gut to arrest her but asks Canada to be the bad guy.
2525 2018-12-11 19:45:03 And they struggle. Families to house, feed and they get pushed out of existing job if they discover anything that threatens status que, ie liquid cheap that replaced oil, in abundance stopped, paid off. Small abundant batteties for cars, bought off.
2526 2018-12-11 19:45:03 It's a pity you don't know who started the coup and that was a counter coup.
Pls excuse me, go back to history class.
2527 2018-12-11 19:45:00 I always find it very amusing that we put zero moral culpability on the demand for energy, expect our government to shut down an industry and put people on welfare and are happy to buy oil from anywhere but Alberta .
2528 2018-12-11 19:44:50 Why not start with getting Canadian oil to Canadian refineries?
2529 2018-12-11 19:44:45 Which essential oil will put more money in my bank account
2530 2018-12-11 19:44:42 I’m guessing a cleansing oil 
2531 2018-12-11 19:44:39 Jamaican castor oil
2532 2018-12-11 19:44:36 Me after the autozone employee pulls out my completely black air filter with dust and mold falling off: 

no thanks just an oil change please :-)
2533 2018-12-11 19:44:35 Fanks Tobes, mum made me burfdee biscwit, it oats, peanut butta, banana n coconut oil, it vewry nommy   *sends sum ova to Tobi* 
2534 2018-12-11 19:44:34 You'll want to have a display showing the difference an oil change can make.
2535 2018-12-11 19:44:31 Ok. Say we refine some oil. How do we get it to market brainiacs? Notley is desperate. Grasping at straws. If this such a great idea, why has no one tried it before? It is called economics and ROI. #AbLeg
2536 2018-12-11 19:44:31 The JLP has called for Paulwell's resignation. Of all the times you choose NOW? From what? The Opposition? So both of y'all is just going to do this distraction thing? After all $5 bil worth of oil is stolen, excuse us, but missing. Took off by itself & pulled a David Blaine.
2537 2018-12-11 19:44:30 WELCOME TO TOMORROW - Some Predictions:

Gasoline/oil companies will go away Drilling for oil will stop !

2538 2018-12-11 19:44:10 *Sips anoiting oil*
2539 2018-12-11 19:44:03 You use oil? Most people do..hmm interesting indeed
2540 2018-12-11 19:44:01 idk ig bcoz it has the formation of OPEC and stuff and the oil embargo in it
2541 2018-12-11 19:43:58 if anyone was wondering what i want for christmas, an essential oil diffuser would be chill
2542 2018-12-11 19:43:46 Roasted yam with oil
2543 2018-12-11 19:43:39 Thicker then coconut oil Put in the fridge 
2544 2018-12-11 19:43:37 These are the type of stories you hear in 9ja, where the officials sleeping when these thieves stole the oil?
2545 2018-12-11 19:43:34 So easy to take tRump down because he doesn’t use facts, he uses snake oil sales tactics that may work in real estate, but cannot work to serve the people.   #IStandWithNancy
#WorstPresidentEver
2546 2018-12-11 19:43:23 @gmuneybagz that’s what that oil called we got right ?
2547 2018-12-11 19:43:13 If Quebec does not want our oil to flow through, then Alberta should stop buying any products produced in Quebec.
2548 2018-12-11 19:43:10 Anyone use primrose oil ??!
2549 2018-12-11 19:43:07 Just checked my oil to find that I have none in my car at all  maybe if I’m lucky I’ll just blow up
2550 2018-12-11 19:43:06 Ion care how low gas is and how far you gotta go... you ain’t helping with my oil change and tires so call somebody else to take
2551 2018-12-11 19:43:06 I like em all but now it’s a cafesito with butter and coconut oil. No cram and no sugar.
2552 2018-12-11 19:43:05 But the federal government has declared it exempt from the "price on pollution", unlike CANADIAN oil. Are you that dense?
2553 2018-12-11 19:43:03 not dependent on other countries oil? US net imports 3.77 MMb/d... and Canada it is't largest importer.  Middle class tax burden is higher than previous, all of 2018 gains are wiped, US is in the brink of recession again.  
He is not defending the first amendment...
2554 2018-12-11 19:42:58 Is it normal for the 40 year old guy that just changed your oil to walk you to your car and open the door for you? And continue to hold the door open so he can hit on you? Is it rude that I said thanks bye and almost slammed his dirty fingers in my door?
2555 2018-12-11 19:42:53 Of the  #BigFourAgenda, which one hasn’t been affected by the recent scandals?
Food security- NCPB drama
Health - NHIF manenos, some containers somewhere 
Manufacturing- Kenya power, KPC oil scandal 
Housing - Aud. Gen says we can’t account for trillions 
So, what is?
2556 2018-12-11 19:42:51 If you look at how Supply Management for Dairy in Canada works, it is basically a scheme to create non competitive markets in the rest of Canada for Quebec dairy. No oil, no dairy?
2557 2018-12-11 19:42:50 Starting a day spa for men where we describe all the services with condescending shit like “give your complexion a tune up” or “get your colon an oil change”
2558 2018-12-11 19:42:37 Until Five Guys stops using peanut oil they’re cancelled. It’s one of the most common allergens around @FiveGuys, can’t you figure something else out??
2559 2018-12-11 19:42:36 You gotta keep the oil flowing in your relationship
2560 2018-12-11 19:42:29 What the hell are you talking about? I live in El Paso a border city, driven down to Tucson and at Douglas Az.  It still looks the same to me.  YOUR A LIAR and snake oil salesman. #MARINESagainstTrump #TrumpShutdown #VetsResistSquadron #VeteransAgainstTrump #MAGA
2561 2018-12-11 19:42:25 Look kids, once the pinnacle of luxury, these abandoned badges of excess on wheels are being abandoned all over the globe as prices of the now scarce resource called oil skyrockets pushing gas dealers underground to avoid persecution.
2562 2018-12-11 19:42:24 Buy rice and oil and join the Xmas giveaway I want to do with some
2563 2018-12-11 19:42:23 I’ve seen what can happen when #oil is discovered. Things change fast.
2564 2018-12-11 19:42:12 The recently built upgrader in Red Water cost 9 billion, and took 4 years. It can only process 79,000 barrels a day. The Oil Sands produce 2.8 million a day. Do the math. We need almost a quarter of a trillion dollars to build 35 more upgraders.
2565 2018-12-11 19:42:09 You have 20 mins to get some quiz questions together and #indiehour gang get the nibble and drinks and a comfy spot on the sofa
2566 2018-12-11 19:41:58 It was also done on the high of the Alberta oil boom thinking there cheaper now
2567 2018-12-11 19:41:45 Great point. This is one reason EV advocates (including @elonmusk) say the game is rigged against electric: Automakers/dealerships know much of their profits come not from selling cars but maintenance. I had my plug-in hybrid for 3 yrs & it needed only 4 oil changes. No repairs.
2568 2018-12-11 19:41:42 How about banning oil and any petroleum product and you’ve got my vote.
2569 2018-12-11 19:41:39 Better times are coming to Mexico with the new government, including the new treatment to the oil industry
2570 2018-12-11 19:41:28 Which one of you sent the tracked package containing a black Buddha oil burner? He’s very nice, but I have no idea why he’s here or who sent him!
2571 2018-12-11 19:41:20 @RachelNotley I'm not an NDP supporter but I do admire the way you are handling the current crisis- New Refinery, Increased Rail Capacity, Pushing for Pipelines- #Alberta #Oil #cdnpoli #news
2572 2018-12-11 19:41:16 my luck is putting coconut oil in my hair then finding out our pipe burst so we had to turn off our water...... so my solution was to wear a beanie BUT now i just like a greasy white boy
2573 2018-12-11 19:41:04 ...We need to tip the balance against the damage the Saudis do in favour of our commitment to improvement in the whole energy industry (which is not limited to oil, but expanded to all energy)
We need make them see we are the good guy provider of choice for a better world
2574 2018-12-11 19:40:32 Made a liter of biodiesel from vegetable oil in the lab today. Was surprisingly simple.
2575 2018-12-11 19:40:20 How about an #Indiehour Xmas quiz & party then 
Impromptu sofa party and quiz.
2576 2018-12-11 19:40:19 What about boycotting all fuel stations that do not guarantee they do not have any Saudi oil?
2577 2018-12-11 19:40:16 TOAdamVaughan: RT MichaelCowtan: This is for everyone who thinks Trudeau buys Saudi Oil. We have a free market, and no government, provincial or federal…
2578 2018-12-11 19:40:13 これ？ドレッシングっていうか廃油。
2579 2018-12-11 19:40:13 Alberta NDP talking about opening new Oil based businesses. I wonder why Alberta is a conservative strong hold.
2580 2018-12-11 19:40:12 So as France, Europe and the US reel from #ClimateAction demonstrations, and after the release of an explosive report on Climate change explaining the urgency to replace fossil fuel, the great minds of Alberta's leaders scramble to build - wait for it - another oil refinery. FFS
2581 2018-12-11 19:40:10 Oil’s formal share of real GDP amounted to just 8.6% in Q3 2018, which makes it the fourth largest sector in the economy after agriculture, trade, and information and communications. Nevertheless, Oil is a major source of FX and revenue for the Federal and State governments.
2582 2018-12-11 19:40:09 Yes, east RR/Hutto smells like an oil field.
2583 2018-12-11 19:40:09 If I see a snap of people flexing money on Christmas ... stay humble & just get your damn oil change
2584 2018-12-11 19:39:54 The dem shift started with dreamers, progressed to parents, now includes all illegals. An interesting, effective transition from hard core stance on illegal immigration prior to Obama. American people are the losers here, amazing how dems have conned them
2585 2018-12-11 19:39:53 It should be quite hard by then BUT it could be that whatever fragrance oil you used softened it a little. They all act a tiddly but different. Keep me posted!!! 
2586 2018-12-11 19:39:43 I look at climate change in the Pascal's Wager sense.

Do nothing and you risk the extermination of all life on earth.
Do something and you risk mildly inconveniencing a dozen rich oil CEOs.
2587 2018-12-11 19:39:41 We do have one short term fix I think we are not taking advantage of as a country
It's obvious Saudi Arabia is a horrific human rights violator
And we have made advances in cleaning up our oil production ...
2588 2018-12-11 19:39:31 Doesn't more oil in the market mean the price drops ???
2589 2018-12-11 19:39:28 Oil
2590 2018-12-11 19:39:19 Have you treated it with mineral oil? It's supposed to absorb the oil so that the oil from your hands no longer leave prints. That's at least what I learned while working part time at Home Depot 
2591 2018-12-11 19:39:19 Remember the day I  fried my eggs with oil and little bit of vodka
2592 2018-12-11 19:39:11 "importance of oil" HOW IS THIS HISTORY
2593 2018-12-11 19:39:11 TIL “caring for the environment” means “getting oil to market in ever increasing amounts”. Interesting!
2594 2018-12-11 19:39:10 Bio oil is pretty good
2595 2018-12-11 19:39:02 This oil I got rn smells like straight chorro 
2596 2018-12-11 19:38:59 Blind is your hyperpartisan notion of Liberal aggression towards Alberta, while the Liberal govt actively spends billions to keep Alberta's economy from crumbling under the weight of low oil prices. You've been indoctrinated by old timey rhetoric. Time to snap out of it #ableg
2597 2018-12-11 19:38:43 How can I tell my children to talk to school, take the stairs, not use straws or plastic bags and know that our government isn't working as hard as my five year old is to fix climate change? Please, no more oil and gas subsidies. Move that money to green technology.
2598 2018-12-11 19:38:41 I literally ALMOST got an oil change today but called Pep Boys Bc I KNEW there would B a wait and they were like “yeah it’s gonna B a few hours.... :)” and I was like “Can I make an appointment for????............ Actually forget it I’ll call another time”
2599 2018-12-11 19:38:35 Just split half my bottle of mario basescu face oil I’m 
2600 2018-12-11 19:38:34 Isn't the proposal usually "Nationalize oil companies and reinvest the profits into renewable energy?"

Not defending such a proposal, but wondering if Chinese ones are put to such use.
2601 2018-12-11 19:38:30 How close is ministry of Ag following the US Farm Act ? Think the oil discount is bad ? are you preparing for the annihilation of the Canadian (specifically) Prairie AG industry ?
2602 2018-12-11 19:38:26 Cause my peace is not to be fucked with at OIL.

2607 2018-12-11 19:38:04 It's clear they just want to continue with the current trend. Most of their promises are quite bogus
2608 2018-12-11 19:37:58 What increased our reserves in the last two years was, devaluation to a price that allowed the market take pressure of us, loans in USD, better oil revenues. Everything else won’t have mattered as much as we think.
2609 2018-12-11 19:37:57 @iamsrk  Full of oil D biriyani  Thy suffered hahaha I hd lot of work so I said No I cant ths is Christmas season for me n New year so ppl will shop n  also tailoring  orders I dnt go easily for any function tht Im invited I avoid I hv 2 much work D time I hv I go 2 D gym or walk
2610 2018-12-11 19:37:54 I hate getting my oil changed, they bring you to your car to tell you all that’s wrong with it making you feel like you’re in trouble. Dad, where you at?!!

2614 2018-12-11 19:37:36 Every US Congress person that is ill prepared to take on #GoogleHearing in front of the public by showing a lack of understanding of how the Google search engine works needs fired. I'm tired of them holding onto their jobs by appeasing to oil lobbyists and only that.
2615 2018-12-11 19:37:14 Don’t ask me to shut up! Please don’t ever!
2616 2018-12-11 19:37:13 Funny. Not that long ago your NDP team were protesting pipelines and the Oil Sands. Elections have a wonderful way to bring realities back into focus. Albertans aren't fooled by the sudden change of political philosophy.
2617 2018-12-11 19:37:03 Me encnatan los shampoooo y conditioner de Morocan Oil pero que caros sonnnnnn
2618 2018-12-11 19:37:00 Reports that forces loyal to Ibrahim Jathran are preparing for an imminent attack on oil terminals in the oil crescent area. The forces are amassing in the Bani Walid area. LNA already mobilizing forces in response. #Libya
2619 2018-12-11 19:36:56 How could you possibly say the bar has been raised? There is absolutely no evidence of such a claim. If anything, the bar has been lowered.

2621 2018-12-11 19:36:50 lol, there's always a bit of that. There's the big money, "trust fund" team thing to hate. Then there's the separate antagonistic relationship we've had with them recently. Mostly it's the clearly dirty use of oil and state-sponsorship money to bully real clubs that bugs me.
2622 2018-12-11 19:36:49 or maybe you need another @BabestationTV shift to grind and oil it out of your system xxx
2623 2018-12-11 19:36:48 My mom is trying to give me car advice yet she’s overdue for an oil change by 7000 miles  she needs to preach it to the mirror and take her own advice
2624 2018-12-11 19:36:41 The guy is a snake oil salesman
2625 2018-12-11 19:36:39 LmAo... who seized power? Man you just making fun of yourself by defending which is crystal clear!
2626 2018-12-11 19:36:33 Unfortunately many members don’t give a shit. Shoot the kids and work for Russia, but don’t take our oil!
2627 2018-12-11 19:36:31 @exxonmobil, more than any other #BigOil company, has billions tied to equipment and drilling infrastructure.

B/c of this, #ClimateChange and #RenewableEnergy represent existential threats to Exxon; aligning them w/ Russia, Saudi Arabia, & Kuwait.

It’s about keeping oil alive
2628 2018-12-11 19:36:29 I get more defined curls using the argan oil eco-styler than the olive oil kind
2629 2018-12-11 19:36:29 trump has told foreign leaders that “America First” means he will always put the needs of America first & that they should do the same for their own country. Saudi leadership took a ‘Saudi first’ policy as they look to cut oil production starting in Jan. LOL yeah, rebuke of "it"
2630 2018-12-11 19:36:21 @ian_partel in this kind of weather while you're think cooking oil and a bar of soap are very cheap and @legendary_qt_ thinks condoms for 3 rounds or pumpers in case shit goes south are cheaper, I think a kettle of chai mukalu, half a kg of sugar and loaf of bread are cheaper.
2631 2018-12-11 19:36:08 I always remember an oil change at the last minute! #LetsMasterThis
2632 2018-12-11 19:36:07 So you're just ordering a forensic audit for the missing barrels of oil? What about the 22 million dollar fence that turned into 90+ million? C'mon @AndrewHolnessJM better than this..
2633 2018-12-11 19:35:51 So it's in your ethics to not use palm oil, but still use other oils that are far less efficient and mean some other endangered species elsewhere dies? I'm not trying to fight you, I was anti palm oil until I found this all out.
2634 2018-12-11 19:35:44 What about nuclear waste. What about all the barrels of radioactive materials stored underground. Let’s shut down the coal mines and keep producing power from these plants. Drill into the earths. Core so we can get more oil and cause earthquakes. Shut down the coal mines
2635 2018-12-11 19:35:35 "revenue" lol
2636 2018-12-11 19:35:35 C’est pour l’acheminer au Nouveau-Brunswick à Irving oil pour le sortir ensuite par port de mer, n’oublie pas ce dont il est question.

2637 2018-12-11 19:35:32 During the last administration we were selling oil for as much as $140 per barrel pls what did they do with it .
2638 2018-12-11 19:35:31 I think Hourglass tried to steal my money with this Lip Oil... not sure if it’s worth the money #lipoil @sephorablog
2639 2018-12-11 19:35:03 EZ Hope! I have several @clutchofficial gear hanging up, 9 albums, it has an oil spot on the shirt..but I'm wearing it now ok? 
2640 2018-12-11 19:35:02 All that work the Democrats did making us subservient is down the drain but don’t worry, a year after the Democrats are back in and we will be begging the Muslims for oil.
2641 2018-12-11 19:34:59 Same as Whatever happened to the Iraq oil export would pay for the Iraq war
2642 2018-12-11 19:34:51 Are you saying royalties and taxes are making Canadian oil unaffordable in international markets?

I think pipelines are a bigger issue followed by regulations and then taxes.
2643 2018-12-11 19:34:48 I don't know how you gonna do it now when you can't afford to pay for private hospital on Nigeria not to talk of travelling out to fix your ailment. Natural remedy won't be bad... Wool and palm oil will be nice at bed time.

2647 2018-12-11 19:34:19 Republicans soften stance on Ukraine; tariffs on aluminum to benefit Oleg deripaska; reimposing sanctions on Iran to benefit selling of Russian oil.
2648 2018-12-11 19:34:13 I hate saying I casually listen to metal bc every time I do some dude with hair greasy enough that the United States wants to invade it for oil comes out of nowhere and interrogates me on my knowledge of unreleased EPs from bands that have names like bloody kumquat death fuck
2649 2018-12-11 19:34:10 We can just move the refined oil by bucket brigade. This is fine.

2652 2018-12-11 19:33:52 All the info I have seen, and by no means is my knowledge exhaustive, says peak oil is 10-20 years away
That's pretty short run in terms of an economy
I don't think we can reduce production costs enough to compete after that

2657 2018-12-11 19:33:39 Before this clueless Buhari came  in people like Jide Omokore, Aluko and Alinson made an oil deal of N1 trillion and chose not to remit to Nigeria under GEJ. 
Try that now and see what happens.

2661 2018-12-11 19:33:18 Freezing their assets wouldn’t change anything but pour more oil in the issue. Canada finds herself again in the middle of the situation.

2663 2018-12-11 19:33:10 This isn’t really why I’m not into sports, I don’t think the comparison is there. Oil spills were never a factor in the first place, nor were other courts.

2675 2018-12-11 19:32:33 In 2008 Barack Hussein Obama said "For the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, we must end the age of oil in our time." Ten years later he takes credit for the US becoming world's largest producer of oil.
2676 2018-12-11 19:32:31 Yeah I think that’s it. I voted for carbon tax and encouraged everyone I knew in Washington state but unfortunately Big Oil won. So I worked hard to flip wa-08 successfully and dr Kim schrier our congress elect is a scientist.

2680 2018-12-11 19:31:54 Palm oil may be vegan regarding the ingredients, but due to the deforestation it causes in order to be harvested, and therefore the loss of animal life, you CANNOT call palm oil vegan. It’s the same as if makeup tested on animals was called vegan bc of ingredients. It’s NOT.

2687 2018-12-11 19:31:13 I probably should have said most of the barriers are not engineering related. Consider the power of incumbents. Big Oil has unbelievable power and has successfully delayed serious climate action for decades. Fossil fuels will be disrupted. The key question is when? Timing matters
2688 2018-12-11 19:31:09 I’m pretty sure that was a rich oil... 
2689 2018-12-11 19:31:00 I'll play. In 2016 there was ONE Democrat in the top 20 recipients of Oil & Gas donations. Her name was Hillary Clinton. 

In 2018, the top 20 recipients again only included two Democrat's. Their names are Heidi Heitkamp and Beto O'Rourke. Bu sure, let's talk about Bernie.
2690 2018-12-11 19:30:55 I think it’s the same idea! The “legend” is: He helped the Maccabees by watching making sure the oil burned for eight days.

He’s less creepy than the Elf too! 
2691 2018-12-11 19:30:54 If you're playing the game as a 'sport' you remove random variables. Basketball doesn't have random oil spills in the middle of the court. They also don't play on 100 different layouts for the court.

2700 2018-12-11 19:30:13 U need a towel man.   .  I also apply oil.
2701 2018-12-11 19:30:03 Oh right.. so what exactly is America or the UK doing about Ukraine? Or Syria? Or Yemen? Or Afghanistan? (after how many years) its a joke. Europe has no oil so America doesnt care.

2705 2018-12-11 19:29:56 STREP - These essential oils, in order of ability, eradicated Streptococcus mutans. the best: Cinnamon oil, lemongrass oil, cedarwood oil, clove oil and eucalyptus oil.
2706 2018-12-11 19:29:56 This is why people don’t respect vegans. Your ethics are so skewed. Do you or do you not want to help animals???? Palm oil does the opposite of that. Beekeeping does not. Nice try
2707 2018-12-11 19:29:54 That'll be the future of the oil and gas sector. Much smaller than today, but still with a whole planet (a richer one with far more people lifted out of poverty I hope) of consumers to supply. And if climate change is beaten then fantastic, but then that issue will have gone.
2708 2018-12-11 19:29:45 Make sure to season the fish and the breading. Try changing the type of oil, when I fry, I use Peanut Oil now.  Also, want a frying fish, not all are meant to be fried.

2711 2018-12-11 19:29:38 sorry to hear that, 
look into - good potent oil - at least 90% THC with frankincense, hops and myrrh that make #JBOMethod of @JindrichBayer 
it has helped a lot of people, I'm sure it can do good for you too
2712 2018-12-11 19:29:36 Lol that's definitely not how it's done. For the best effect you have to separate the thc first by frying the plant on low heat in oil, strain and add the oil to the mixture (dough). Thank me later.
2713 2018-12-11 19:29:27 The US was by far the best customer when PADDII was short oil.  Disruptive technology required adaptation to the market but Canada has not adapted. 

Royalties is a separate discussion and doesn't relate to market access.
2714 2018-12-11 19:29:24 I want to cut off my hair and throw it into the sea and always be wearing those beanies and carry old oil lamps ! A simple dream!

2722 2018-12-11 19:28:18 Meanwhile, everything must continue even throughout the energy transition. And afterwards if people imagine there being no oil and gas sector they're kidding themselves. Remove it from energy and it'll still exist in production of countless products...
2723 2018-12-11 19:28:09 Wait til you see the oil fields 
2724 2018-12-11 19:28:05 Depressing when you go to buy your favorite food @TWIZZLERS and learn they have palm oil in them  my taste is not worth assisting the destruction on rainforests 
2725 2018-12-11 19:28:00 That’s like saying makeup with animal testing is vegan, just because it doesn’t have animal products. It’s not. Palm oil is not vegan.
2726 2018-12-11 19:27:55 Nor do I think they forgot King Faisal and the oil shock of ‘73.
2727 2018-12-11 19:27:50 Swear I seems like I get my oil changed once a month.
2728 2018-12-11 19:27:45 the smell of the oil yes, but i can eat them!
2729 2018-12-11 19:27:43 Again. Not zero sum. Less oil. More other. 
And I never indicated any position on rail transport safety.  
You keep moving the goal posts for our discussion by bringing in new factors.
2730 2018-12-11 19:27:40 Chef things: using olive oil as a moisturizer because no one in the kitchen has hand lotion
2731 2018-12-11 19:27:35 Has everything to do with their cis-male identity.
2732 2018-12-11 19:27:31 Honestly had the same issue but ive tried using oil (rose hip seed) and my skins way clearer and not oily or dry just norm 
2733 2018-12-11 19:27:25 Oil no dey Wike Head again... 
2734 2018-12-11 19:27:20 Am not saying, I just mean we shouldn't excuse mediocrity
2735 2018-12-11 19:27:19 I love my lead at work yall. I made her smell this essential oil I have because I knew she’d like it and she went “oh yeah smells like cocaine” akfjskvsnjf

2739 2018-12-11 19:26:51 Mr.seun,you are right.poverty is  a state of mind - it occurs in a man's mind and eventually materialize in is welfare in the longrun something unknowingly,that is what really happened to those guys that are scooping the oil in drainage.
2740 2018-12-11 19:26:47 Favorite part of twitter is watching people make up drama. And all this over a tweet pointing out that Beto takes oil and gas industry money.
2741 2018-12-11 19:26:46 Oil of oregano!
2742 2018-12-11 19:26:42 As for leaving, don't let the door hit you on the way out. I'm sure your landlocked country of 4 million people will do better and have more luck getting your dirty oil to market all on its own.  
2743 2018-12-11 19:26:42 Ooh ooh ooh. Give it a try @tupteaUK Their Earl Grey is TEAlicious! Nice balance of both the tea and bergamot oil! #teahour

2746 2018-12-11 19:26:05 I found bio oil was definitely the best, so good for when bump was itchy too, worth a try!  thanks Kirsty  sickness is still so bad but it’ll be worth it in the end! So different to my pregnant with Cailean- wasn’t sick a day with him! Hope you’re keeping well too! 
2747 2018-12-11 19:25:53 Also, the deforestation caused by harvesting palm oil kills SO many animals. As a vegan, you should in no way support or eat palm oil.
2748 2018-12-11 19:25:33 The #GoogleHearing along with our Congress trying to tackle #facebook shows you why our Congress is only good at making corporate oil donors rich and will continue to do so.
2749 2018-12-11 19:25:32 I mean, tru

So is oil 
2750 2018-12-11 19:25:32 I feel like when you get your oil change it makes you feel grown and unstoppable 
2751 2018-12-11 19:25:20 And you think shaming that person is the way forward?
2752 2018-12-11 19:25:18 @RachelNotley , @DeronBilous  open  a news conference about the oil price differential with a video ad about "Made in Alberta." Plenty of pictures about the energy sector. #ableg
2753 2018-12-11 19:25:15 So... You're saying somewhere around 49% of the people you know in oil and gas value the environment more than their paycheck.
2754 2018-12-11 19:25:13 While you sleep tonight, spare a thought for the Election Commission of India officials and desk hands who are burning the midnight oil. It’s been a long, gruelling election season for them and they are still counting down to that final assembly seat result in #MadhyaPradesh!
2755 2018-12-11 19:25:03 Days like today the baby oil hits ya skin just right
2756 2018-12-11 19:24:58 Oil no dey Wike Head... At all 
2757 2018-12-11 19:24:49 Burn it, use less fuel oil.
2758 2018-12-11 19:24:38 But is oil everywhere? :)
2759 2018-12-11 19:24:33 Shut up to save you stress, the Igbo's led the bloodiest coup in the history of this country killing Ahmadu Bello, Tafawa Balewa and others.
2760 2018-12-11 19:24:32 And also you’re the one putting a socialist label on this. As I understand, a green new deal is about investing in renewable energy to leverage opportunity cost against volatile international oil markets (a capitalistic strategy aimed at increasing national security.)
2761 2018-12-11 19:24:21 Well your level of understanding can’t make you see the points i stated earlier.
2762 2018-12-11 19:24:19 Neither hydro nor oil are included.
2763 2018-12-11 19:24:15 Cooking oil
2764 2018-12-11 19:24:09 Yes. It always changing. I can only suggest you do some research. You will then find that Scotland is at the forefront of oil and gas exploration and the utilisation of spent wells as well as exporting energy to the rest of the UK, or elsewhere, for a long time to come.
2765 2018-12-11 19:24:07 Massive ‘deep life’ study reveals billions of tonnes of microbes living far beneath Earth’s surface:KEEP DRILLIN' FOR PHUK'N OIL AND DEY ALL GONNA BE UP HERE GOBBLIN' US UP !!!
2766 2018-12-11 19:24:00 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
2767 2018-12-11 19:24:00 You are so frustrating. 
Pointing out when it started reinforces that everything has a beginning. And an ending. 
We need to move away from dependency on oil. I don't say 0 oil. Reality is degrees. Less is not a synonym for none. 
We can depend less on oil, more on spending else.
2768 2018-12-11 19:23:59 I dare you to post the video of the oil tank ..... 
2769 2018-12-11 19:23:59 Buhari is Clueless 
Buhari sold oil at an average of $50 of less than 700,000 barrel at some points because of militancy, yet had moved that FX to $47 Billion in 3 years.
2770 2018-12-11 19:23:54 He did no such thing. The oil and gas industry did. And it’s technically not true. You still import 7 million barrels a day.
2771 2018-12-11 19:23:48 Lol
2772 2018-12-11 19:23:48 Oil at $20 a barrel would be the best thing for world peace and those heavily dependent on oil revenue (countries)would see an impressive increase in the number of graduates as well as basic reading and arithmetic. Also less dependency on hard working expatriates.
2773 2018-12-11 19:23:43 Try Luke’s martini with the olive oil and basil ‘wash’. Dirty without the dirt.
2774 2018-12-11 19:23:42 Majority is a strong word.
2775 2018-12-11 19:23:19 She’s really gonna make me waste a canvas on an hour long oil still life huh
2776 2018-12-11 19:23:16 like y is coconut oil so good?
2777 2018-12-11 19:23:12 pledge is "to not KNOWINGLY accept any contributions over $200 from the PACs, executives,". He only violated the pledge if he KNOWINGLY took $200+ from oil execs. Since ActBlue doesn't job titles, how could Beto possibly know this?
2778 2018-12-11 19:23:11 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails
2779 2018-12-11 19:23:07 Not exactly sure per barrel. I’m not really comfortable trying to calculate it since subsides are usually applied to production/extraction and depends on oil prices - it ends up being billions of dollars annually.
2780 2018-12-11 19:23:06 Hi Matthew, Becel margarine includes a small amount of palm oil to help ensure it delivers the spreadable quality you’ve come to love. We’ve worked hard to sustainably source palm oil and are always looking for new methods to do so, based on new research and innovations.
2781 2018-12-11 19:23:05 Castor oil, lavender essential oil, tea tree essential oil and coconut oil- my recipe for hair fall control 
2782 2018-12-11 19:23:03 so I have done my homework, gotten new tires and an oil change, bought new brake pads, done Christmas shopping and now I’m out to lunch with my mom. it’s called being productive ladies
2783 2018-12-11 19:23:02 help i cannot stop eating baguette olive oil and balsamic vingear but the good thick kind help!!
2784 2018-12-11 19:22:53 You haven’t gotten an oil change all year
2785 2018-12-11 19:22:44 HASTIADA DE Q ME HABLEN DE "RÉCORDS" Y "BOOMS" Q SON FICCIÓN.
A VER "CHIQUES", HOY NO PODÉS COMPRAR GAS OIL P/ MOVER TRACTORES SI NO PAGÁS DE CONTADO (O TE ROMPEN EL TUJES CON LA TASA Q TE APLICAN, AUN SI LES DAS CHEQUE A 15 DÍAS).
HOY LABURAR DE PRODUCTOR ES UNA EPOPEYA DIARIA.
2786 2018-12-11 19:22:35 thankful for lavender essential oil in times of distress
2787 2018-12-11 19:22:23 And they have effectively balanced this issue for over 30 years to the detriment of the American people, pandering to special interests and political maneuvering on illegal immigration. It's not good on any level for the people
2788 2018-12-11 19:22:22 Notley going live any minute regarding further steps to increase oil price.
2789 2018-12-11 19:22:18 Is the butter a topping here or are you cooking with it; because mayo browns bread BEAUTIFULLY. Real mayo. It’s just oil and eggs so it works out
2790 2018-12-11 19:22:16 Oh boy they get a few things right and burn the rest of the game in an oil rig that sank in the ocean
2791 2018-12-11 19:22:08 it depends on if you have dry scalp or dandruff bc they're diff. true cause of dandruff is unknown but it does often have to do w oil overproduction internally, not externally tho. also, adding oil to your hair doesn't treat/cure anything. it's honestly just a styling aid...
2792 2018-12-11 19:22:07 When buying CBD oil online, look for established companies that offer high-grade, quality hemp products that have been sustainably sourced and third-party tested for quality.
2793 2018-12-11 19:22:05 Gurunada! I love it. Mine came with the Refresh oil

2795 2018-12-11 19:22:02 Yes, soybeans for cattle is a red herring. It goes into poultry and pork and humans directly. Not sure how much, but I expect oil also finds its way into 'green' biofuels.
2796 2018-12-11 19:22:00 Things I have bought at Canadian Tire: skates, basketball net for driveway, ratchet set and other tools, camping accessories, rubber boots, motor oil, light fixtures, ladder, cleaning supplies, toaster, shovels, Rubbermaid boxes... don't think I've bought tires.
2797 2018-12-11 19:21:57 You clearly showed you lack the right to question since you don’t know the difference between a coup and a coup d’etat
2798 2018-12-11 19:21:51 I want to give you a full body massage with coconut oil and then lick it iff of you.
2799 2018-12-11 19:21:42 My roommate @Never_Nguyen just called Olive Oil Italian water 
2800 2018-12-11 19:21:39 He’s a lifelong republican, unlike you a lifelong democrat who switched up to run for president because, by your own admission, can sell those fools the snake oil they crave. There is no more republicans left thanks to you.
Only Trump cult followers
2801 2018-12-11 19:21:24 Because its bullshit imperialist propaganda that is meant to scare you. You are not a CEO of an oil company. The conquests of the rich are not your own. You are a laborer and the rich will kill a lot more of us than Russians this or any other given year.
2802 2018-12-11 19:21:14 Where can I get an oil change for the low ??
2803 2018-12-11 19:21:03 I think in real life people care more about freebies or loan waivers or oil price cut than religion/temple.

Also, I don't think we can generalise and connect with voters on the issue of mandir or Hindu khatre mein hai. We don't have that kind of unity.
2804 2018-12-11 19:20:52 Without a Free Press in place, snake oil salesmen ,like Trump would be able to pull off any criminal and immoral act they wished.
2805 2018-12-11 19:20:45 Yes one sect the same who financed Bin  Laden. Saudi Fighting ISIS in severalparts of oil country.
2806 2018-12-11 19:20:45 And they will rebenchmark weekly US oil production lower tomorrow too.
2807 2018-12-11 19:20:41 Very limited upside crude oil..

2812 2018-12-11 19:20:11 I just got a top off and an oil change for free!! S/o to the cute mechanics
2813 2018-12-11 19:20:06 Trump touts the measures he’s taken to secure the border, numbers compiled by US Customs and Border Patrol indicate that the 62,456 border-crossers were arrested or denied entry last month — the highest number during the Trump presidency,a conman snake oil salesman #voteblue2020
2814 2018-12-11 19:20:02 I mean the real shit
The crushed garlic mashed into olive oil with righteous anger
2815 2018-12-11 19:19:56 Lend me some oil, so I can burn it all night long
2816 2018-12-11 19:19:56 The EU has our backs...that's right... Simon, and they have our fronts, sides, oil, gas, fish, forests,  our sons and daughters for PESCO... Well and truly  shafting our backsides.
2817 2018-12-11 19:19:54 Cause they found out how gullible you were
2818 2018-12-11 19:19:48 Oil production has been booming in the U.S. as the shale revolution swept the nation. America is now the world’s largest producer of petroleum, passing Russia and Saudi Arabia. As the U.S. oil boom spread, the power of OPEC was reduced and gas prices in the U.S.
2819 2018-12-11 19:19:45 I hate people that involve in ramblings without fact to back them up, pin point how the North dragged you back or get out of here.
2820 2018-12-11 19:19:38 Bien grandote dice MOTOR OIL
2821 2018-12-11 19:19:14 To do so requires leadership. I hope Kenny does so. Related , the CF18 in Cold Lake are being moved to Quebec, for just reasons or fear of losing them in a separation. If separated , how do we get oil to the coasts ??
2822 2018-12-11 19:19:08 I think, saudies love to be magnified, and trump knows it. Trump is a business man with excellent body language skill. Its an excellent opportunity for trump also huge oil fields should be protected but saudies should  be scared from Iran. This is all.

2825 2018-12-11 19:18:56 So sorry dear
Just treat the wounds
Use lavender oil to avoid having scars, antibiotic and vitamin c
2826 2018-12-11 19:18:50 Go back to your history class, you lack facts, the colonial masters came to meet the North established as an entity with education, civilization, unity, culture and a way government.
They didn't meet us tying leaves.
Hence they handed us the leadership.
2827 2018-12-11 19:18:49 FYI "Poudre de perlimpinpin" is Snake Oil
2828 2018-12-11 19:18:44 Putin aiding Venezuela in the sale of oil 2the Caribbean nations includ’g Haiti Using backdoor channels of Russian mob in Miami-any FED who investigated ClintonFoundation has led them 2Miami where they were found dead.Not complicated when you understand RUS connection @GeorgWebb
2829 2018-12-11 19:18:41 It's for harvesting innocent blood and oil.
2830 2018-12-11 19:18:20 Big Oil, Don't you really mean Big Population? Over Population is the problem, not so much in the US, but in Modernized Asia, where small CC cars & motorcycles are driven, buses churning out diesel fumes, cell phones heating up the air, & everyone exhaling CO2. & eating it all.
2831 2018-12-11 19:18:12 One of my favorite Matt Damon lines is in the movie Syriana. “A hundred years ago before you found oil you were running around the desert cutting each other’s heads off. In a hundred years from now when the oil runs out you’ll be back incutting each other’s head off.” Classic
2832 2018-12-11 19:18:12 Changing the names of Cities can’t be made an agenda, Middle Class General and  OBC voters are feeling sidelined. Clarification on stuffs like RBI Gov Resgn. Oil prices, Rupee fall must be addressed properly and frequently.
2833 2018-12-11 19:18:05 yes!! my miraculous olive oil
2834 2018-12-11 19:18:04 45 years, the malaise started in '73 with the oil crisis.
2835 2018-12-11 19:18:04 We cn neva stop talking about hw gross d past government was, how they dd nt develop our infrastructure, hw they made us depend solely on crude oil, hw they loot our common wealth, it is unforgivable.Dt is y history is taught in schools, we can never forget Wer we coming from...
2836 2018-12-11 19:18:03 Listen she is protecting that skin at any cost. I wish I had been more proactive when young versus cooking in baby oil at the first sign of sunshine 
2837 2018-12-11 19:18:00 Good, enjoy!

But seriously, get your head out of the oil, we need other economic drivers here. Thinking leaving Canada will magically solve oil problems is so. fucking. stupid.
2838 2018-12-11 19:17:55 Oh my people who think twice before spending.. think thrice before you opt for opaque acrylic / oil painting..

ಅರ್ಧ painting ಗೆ ನೇ ಅರ್ಧ bottle paint ಖಾಲಿ! ಜೀವ ತಡ್ಯಲ್ಲ ಮರ್ರೆ :(
2839 2018-12-11 19:17:44 I understand Louisiana is the hub for oil and gas, but Louisiana is not reaping any benefit.
People are still dying poor after working like Hell their whole lives.
Your state is too rich in human & other resources to have to depend on others making $ off your state.
2840 2018-12-11 19:17:27 The fact that you have to ask that question is ludicrous! We are now for the first time not dependent on other countries oil, he is not taxing the crap out of the middle class, jobs are soring, our Police are being fought for,  He is defending the First and Second Amendment...
2841 2018-12-11 19:17:18 We don’t need palm oil at all. Stop it! We need diverse wildlife, ecosystems, and land to sustain them. We will perish if we fail to heed the signs of us diminishing that.
2842 2018-12-11 19:17:17 Paleo baking 101: coconut oil is odd to work with
2843 2018-12-11 19:17:15 Even if fracking were eliminated tomorrow,  the extraction of oil and gas would be dangerous.  Further, fracking, by its very nature, is horrible because it just speeds up and increases the amount of production.
2844 2018-12-11 19:17:06 Wow cars give me an extreme level of money anxiety.... Gas, gas, gas every other week, don’t forget your oil changes! haha you totally forgot about your insurance bill, oh hey it’s December? here’s some $700 maintenance just for funsies.
2845 2018-12-11 19:17:03 nobody told me tea tree oil would smell so nasty
2846 2018-12-11 19:16:56 Sitting in the waiting room at the car dealership while I get my oil changed, and I’ve counted 6 separate people sniffling, hacking, and coughing omg....is this hell?????
2847 2018-12-11 19:16:55 I can’t help but think that if I had a girlfriend I wouldn’t have felt the need to spend $60 on an essential oil diffuser
2848 2018-12-11 19:16:52 download the Magoosh GRE apps. Do mental arithmetic in yr free time: driving, in the shower, daydreaming. Practice practice practice. You're going to do fine. Oil those rusty mental gears & soon enough you'll get the groove back! I'm complete ass @ math but practice really helped
2849 2018-12-11 19:16:51 If there are any channels worth burning midnight oil then it's @MirrorNow and @NDTV
2850 2018-12-11 19:16:49 1) How does child marriage in your terms affect the development of your regions?
2)Go back and study history and govt cos you just proved you know nothing by saying the North led the bloodiest coup d'etat in Nigeria.
2851 2018-12-11 19:16:19 @realDonaldTrump With govt closed, less attention to emoulment/Russia, corruption investigation. All the while the most awesome, incredible flimflamming,bamboozling, GRIFTING SNAKE OIL SALES CAPER IS being pulled off the US Treasury with the probable take $BILLIONS OR A $TRILLION
2852 2018-12-11 19:16:15 @DontWorryBoutB girl that did my hair said dandruff or flakes isn’t a sign of dry scalp but too much oil in my hair.. ummm I thought it was the opposite, that’s why I oil my hair.. 
2853 2018-12-11 19:16:13 So it's your way or the highway?
Trying to pack the country with as many government dependant voters as possible before the inevitable amnesty?
2854 2018-12-11 19:16:03 I checked the oil and it’s good lol but thank you
2855 2018-12-11 19:16:01 My aunt is a blessing. My car needs an oil change and the only appointment available was for 8 am and she’s like”I will take it for you so you don’t have to wake up early.”
2856 2018-12-11 19:15:52 Tudo a falar do que aconteceu,”gente sem mentalidade”/“estas merdas são escusadas”, merdas destas não aconteciam se as pessoas que vocês sabem não se armassem em boas a mandar boquinhas porque em paleio toda a gente reina! Fica a dica!!! Props poh puto Oil
2857 2018-12-11 19:15:49 Re: Nuclear bombers: I've been saying since the Venezuelan president was *put* in office that Putin was involved heavily bc of OIL. Russians have never been involved N South or Central America, they wouldn't dare bc it's our backyard. Trump is DANGEROUS. Trump's Putin's enabler.
2858 2018-12-11 19:15:47 My animals are so damn boujee lol give them coconut oil in their food once and they won’t eat without it
2859 2018-12-11 19:15:40 It’s been done all over the world.
Fossil fuels make people more money for less product than clean energy.
Both require skilled & unskilled labor, jobs will be created & people won’t die getting oil for the 1% to sell.
No rig fires. No oil spills.
The US literally above water.
2860 2018-12-11 19:15:40 Oil. It's about oil.
2861 2018-12-11 19:15:34 China is a main client of Iran's oil. It's natural for them to help each other.
2862 2018-12-11 19:15:24 Guyyyy I can slap those buka people, they'll now put tintinni stew and baff your rice oil
2863 2018-12-11 19:15:19 @JustinTrudeau needs to acquire the intestinal fortitude necessary to apply tariffs on oil from outside North America.
2864 2018-12-11 19:15:18 Actually Carbon Capture is the way forward which utilises empty gas wells. That's progressing as well. The oil and gas industry shouldn't have been privatised by WM for short gain. It should have been nationalised for the common good as in Norway. WM is incompetent.
2865 2018-12-11 19:15:18 Kansas Aviation's PW100 & PW150 accessory capabilities include fuel to oil heaters and coolers, fuel pumps and flow dividers. #PW100 #PW150 #fuelpumps
2866 2018-12-11 19:15:11 It couldn't be more obvious. I'm surprised that his hand isn't covered in oil. 

Closeted and self-hating for it. Like a lot of homophobes.
2867 2018-12-11 19:15:03 We should respect the the snake oil salesman who wants to give us IMPRACTICALLY HUGE WALLS BUILT FOR RACISM!
2868 2018-12-11 19:15:03 @OhhMyGoddard in cooking oil
2869 2018-12-11 19:14:50 Emeralds Diamonds oil gold, silver iron trillions upon trillions of dollars. Money the US will not let meth peddlers and cartels gain control of. Either the central and south American people stay and retake their nation from these people, or they live in cities at the border.
2870 2018-12-11 19:14:46 Better Drink Some Castro Oil
2871 2018-12-11 19:14:44 "The whitest and grooviest things in the world cannot be pursued or even ingested - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
2872 2018-12-11 19:14:38 Could we start with cancelling subsidies to fossil fuel companies, canceling Trans Mountain, and closing the oil sands?
2873 2018-12-11 19:14:35 Brett was on Joe Rogan. Brett claimed that any cult or religion is true, if it has some use/ benefit. What about it being true? Brett sells this lovely oil, that he extracts from snakes.
2874 2018-12-11 19:14:17 Me garinku Yasir .
2875 2018-12-11 19:14:16 I mean he looks like he ejaculates motor oil and debris himself
2876 2018-12-11 19:14:13 At KPC there more than can be seen, if anyone did lifestyle audit on Operations & Control Room staff, you will find out where spillage is? It's a close knit web between staff, truckers & independent oil marketers.....it has been in existence since the 90s
2877 2018-12-11 19:14:11 Sensitive skin and skin disease twitter.... 
Tea Tree oil is a life hack !! 

My skin disease and sensitive skin were causing serious scalp issues and after paying thousands to try to fix it, I realize a lil $40 bottle of tea tree oil saved my scalp. 

Use itttttttttt
2878 2018-12-11 19:14:11 Lmao sounds alot like Obama with taking credit for everything. Like oil prices and the economy plus saying he had no scandals. I knew what it meant just wanted to see if you would post it.
2879 2018-12-11 19:14:09 I'm calling you a troll because I looked at your profile. Anyone who supports the Liar-in-Chief really can't claim to have learned not to trust liars. You've obviously not learned anything. Don't have to be a liberal to see your cult leader for the lying snake oil salesman he is.
2880 2018-12-11 19:14:08 @Ryvita Isn't it time you remove palm oil from your crackers? Come on others do not use palm oil, Why do you when you are among the most expensive ones?
2881 2018-12-11 19:13:48 A2 and check your oil! #LetsMasterThis
2882 2018-12-11 19:13:46 They'll feel reluctant and still be poor at what they're taught.
Whatever we do as Muslims we should do it excellently, the least expected of someone being taught in English all his life is to be able to construct simple error free sentence both in written and speech.

2885 2018-12-11 19:13:38 Yesss her all natural CBD oil
2886 2018-12-11 19:13:38 She knows her decision is made but it means a lot for both Lena and Cat to give her the time and space to think about it further. It's one of the best things about them, how they allow Kara a chance to carve her own path where she can strike gold and oil or make mistakes. -
2887 2018-12-11 19:13:35 Yeahhhh, you need to tell this to the oil barons!
2888 2018-12-11 19:13:33 Bio oil, all day every day, it’s the best! Also, there was a Coconut body butter I used which was fab!
2889 2018-12-11 19:13:28 I was born @ night, but not last night. The US is now a net exporter oil. A reasonable admin would regard that as a strengthening of its hand in dealing with OPEC countries in general, if they do things like kill reporters. "We need to keep buying their oil!" is off the table.
2890 2018-12-11 19:13:22 No se, si está en lo cierto el Peak Oil y vamos a un mundo con muchos menos recursos es correcto decrecer la población
Otra cosa es que el motivo real es que esto es una mierds en cuanto a curro y capacidad de compaginar
2891 2018-12-11 19:13:14 I need to get my oil changed
2892 2018-12-11 19:13:10 #PokemonLetsGo wow you have such a pretty team, and then... oil spill Muk lmao
2893 2018-12-11 19:13:09 girl when my son doesn't poop for a few days, I use a qtip and I dip it in baby oil and force him to poop. And it works every time. He gets constipated so easily and it hurts him to poop, and it makes me so sad.
2894 2018-12-11 19:13:08 Grammar please...grammar.
2895 2018-12-11 19:13:08 Good olive oil, home made stock, fresh seafood - haddock and prawns.
2896 2018-12-11 19:12:58 i need to get an oil change but Benny’s just gonna have to wait till Friday
2897 2018-12-11 19:12:55 I never actually beat it tbh, i remember always dying a lot at the oil factory 
2898 2018-12-11 19:12:47 Frying meats because the fat in butter induces browning better than oil. But I've never had a sandwich with toasted bread that wasn't smeared in butter, and you won't find a Southern sandwich that hasn't been buttered either.
2899 2018-12-11 19:12:45 I was driving down a country road in Wisconsin and noticed what apeared to be a Chistmas tree farm as I looked closer I realized it was rows and rows of cannabis. I later found out it was hemp being grown for CBD oil. So yeah it's legit.
2900 2018-12-11 19:12:37 Life is better with chili oil
2901 2018-12-11 19:12:27 Enjoy your CBD oil hippies looks like I'll be the only one who survives The Rapture
2902 2018-12-11 19:12:18 I sell cbd oil if you’re interested
2903 2018-12-11 19:12:14 This is to be expected and the awareness is growing. I tread with caution bc some seem to take it like one big joke! I don't take it that way at all and this is a good graphic of hiw I picture it goin down too. Thanks for the reinforcement so much for big oil
2904 2018-12-11 19:12:12 A1- Oil changed! I'm SOOO bad at doing this... #LetsMasterThis
2905 2018-12-11 19:12:05 Everything we do has Co2 output. At least I try to keep fossil fuel use to a minimum, that’s the goal. Gas, oil and electricity are all burners of fossil fuels. Sadly Solar is still only making a tiny dent no matter what the numpty graphics say
2906 2018-12-11 19:11:56 *oil
2907 2018-12-11 19:11:41 Honestly, the temptation to just squeeze the oil paint tubes straight into my mouth during my art class is  too strong
2908 2018-12-11 19:11:39 And just in case us BC ers conveniently forget...
 Massive oil and gas and 'fracking' operations in the early stages in Northern sections of the province.
 Those companies will ravage our resources and environment all the same as was done in AB
 Give it time
2909 2018-12-11 19:11:34 China concluding an oil deal in Yuan this year with KSA is a potential portent. If the dollar is challenged as the reserve currency, then the US could be in trouble long term (not that I am a econ expert - those who give a figure or date but not the two together!)
2910 2018-12-11 19:11:32 Oil my scalp
2911 2018-12-11 19:11:25 I use regular castor oil is there a difference between that and the Jamaican?
2912 2018-12-11 19:11:16 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2913 2018-12-11 19:11:15 Walls with moats and draw bridges are really the latest technology. Cauldrons of hot oil are good too.
2914 2018-12-11 19:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza today will be: raw crust with stale motor oil and spinach.
2915 2018-12-11 19:10:57 The Daily Least. Leftist Snake Oil Propaganda.
2916 2018-12-11 19:10:53 KHRC has approved a proposal to classify cannabidiol (hemp oil) as a Class B drug. KHRC received a “report of finding” in mid-September of a horse testing positive for the substance.
2917 2018-12-11 19:10:49 most commercially bought 'butter' is watered down with vegetable oil/margarine to make it easier to spread
2918 2018-12-11 19:10:46 Not sure how we were energy independent when we depended on foreign oil and the green energy business went belly up with our money. Thanks Obama. The ACA was also another Obama theft specialty.
2919 2018-12-11 19:10:46 The olive oil on my hair is going to stain the hell outta this white ass coat 
2920 2018-12-11 19:10:42 North and South Korea are'nt going to war, the tariffs are working, China is now going to lower car tariffs to 15% from 40%, Canada now has fair tariffs which will help the farmers, unemployment at record low, GDP is 3.7 (O said would never happen), we're now oil independent. WIN
2921 2018-12-11 19:10:39 Scotland is leading the world in renewables and is self-sufficient in energy. Wind power alone has just produced 109 pc of household needs. Scotland exports its excess energy to the rest of the UK which needs to import energy from France as well. Oil production increasing as well
2922 2018-12-11 19:10:39 They don't need ours much due ti US fracking and foreign oil etc. Much heating is electricity there.
2923 2018-12-11 19:10:34 Not if Coop-Dak-Zeke have anything to say about it!! Gonna see them live at Lucas Oil where I'll get to celebrate win #6 in a row!!

2927 2018-12-11 19:10:13 Dude at the fucking oil change place called me SIR, almost had to square up on his ass bc it’s ladies day and I need my discount
2928 2018-12-11 19:10:09 Hey L Houlihan - CBD Oil(@doil_cb), thank you for following me
2929 2018-12-11 19:10:07 ああ、これはまずい。実にまずい。0.1トン超えたよ。
2930 2018-12-11 19:10:04 We got our oil
2931 2018-12-11 19:10:00 Austin Fire is receiving numerous reports of gas odor outside across the city Nothing has been found by any of the units for the calls we’ve responded to. Appears to be moving north into the Pflugerville area. Most likely odor from Lockhart/Luling oil fields.
2932 2018-12-11 19:09:54 Funny second hand anything screws up your lungs vaping leaves oil inside your lungs causing drowning in your sleep. And cigarettes  kill millions every year so pot with do the same to your lungs they will just fill with ash.
2933 2018-12-11 19:09:48 1 of the reasons so many people are Junkies is cuz they're trying 2 hide from the truth. We can't be expected 2 commit ourselves 2 a society we don't believe in. We stole this land, we stole people from Africa, &now we're killing people in the Middle East just to have cheap oil.
2934 2018-12-11 19:09:43 Make it a holiday project. Sandpaper and a bit of furniture oil will go a long way.
2935 2018-12-11 19:09:41 Bacon oil
2936 2018-12-11 19:09:40 yes.. if held 4 months ago... but things changes... in many diff ways: oil prices cooled, Cong lost momentum (made worse by no leader declared n more imp ticket mess which perhaps cost them 2 dz seats) n scare of rout led to unity in warring camps in BJP as well.
2937 2018-12-11 19:09:36 me: *sneezes once*
my asian family: uh oh you are SICK go take some medicine right now and rub green oil on your chest before you DIE
2938 2018-12-11 19:09:35 It’s the only way to get oil to market
2939 2018-12-11 19:09:32 I agree to some extent here. But when your an oil tanker with millions of gallons (customers) vs a speed boat  (many barrels but not millions) - scale also matters. Not speed. Dare I say experience (runway) and patience often win here
2940 2018-12-11 19:09:32 Some cars use the oil up as it goes...gotta check them once a week or so. And I don’t mean leaking out either.
2941 2018-12-11 19:09:01 Is there a way to make a play on it, like Oilers/Oil Kings?
2942 2018-12-11 19:08:58 I heard they give rim jobs instead of oil changes so I sent @Mikej1392 to test it out
2943 2018-12-11 19:08:52 The @albertaNDP won on a lucky perfect storm election.  They ramped up public spending to saddle the future generations with this debt knowing they would be one term.  No different than Iraq setting fire to the oil fields as the fleed Kuwait.
2944 2018-12-11 19:08:49 Rotating my tires and doing an oil change is an easy hour of work. Gotta do it while the sun is up 
2945 2018-12-11 19:08:48 And maybe check the oil level and maybe just maybe it won’t explode 
2946 2018-12-11 19:08:43 Gone fishing
Where water denied life
Caught a tiny thing
Threw it back alive
Looked captivating
Where turbid oil is rife.
Say 'thank you' before fleeing
For I made you survive.
2947 2018-12-11 19:08:31 We were energy independent before Trump came along.  And Russia has always needed more oil - it's why Putin hates the Magnitsky sanctions so much and continues to engage in the middle east.
2948 2018-12-11 19:08:28 I got some of Franks salmon oil on my hand and the smell will literally not get out but its cool bc I have work in 20 at a sushi restaurant
2949 2018-12-11 19:08:27 I think it could be more of a change of routine. Try cleaning it well in the shower every 2-3 days. Shampoo then when conditioning, brush it through with your fingers or a wide toothed comb. If it's difficult, use more conditioner. Maybe use argon oil and then air dry.
2950 2018-12-11 19:08:01 Imaginatik and the Oil and Gas Technology Centre have been selected to present their poster on open innovation in the energy sector at the World Open Innovation Conference later this week. #WOIC2018 #OpenInnovation @theogtc
2951 2018-12-11 19:08:00 A1 Husband always has oil filter changed, rotate tires, fill window washer, clean all windows and if need be replace wipers #LetsMasterThis #AD
2952 2018-12-11 19:07:52 A wall and EFFECTIVE barriers is a keystone of security. Without it, it's like hiring border agents and refusing to buy vehicles for them to drive and claiming nobody is stopping them from patrolling the border. Debate is absurd
2953 2018-12-11 19:07:43 eia cuts #oil price forecast for 2019.   ups 2019 us #oil production outlook #oott
2954 2018-12-11 19:07:37 Coconut oil
2955 2018-12-11 19:07:37 Oil!
2956 2018-12-11 19:07:14 At the very least we need the Core CPI below 2%. It is above 2% now. Also we need to see wages growth falter and right now wage growth is spiking. Oil and commodities going down for a couple of months is not indicative of lack of core inflation.
2957 2018-12-11 19:07:10 Let's hope real newsflow now starts      
2958 2018-12-11 19:07:10 With #Oil down since 09/2018 isn`t it quite possible that QI-2019 and QII-2019 are also Quad4?
2959 2018-12-11 19:07:09 So, you are admitting that inflation was moving FASTER than they could print the money, proving that money printing was not the driving factor.  And had you connected the dots, you'd realize that food scarcity was the main driving factor, caused by oil prices dropping.
2960 2018-12-11 19:07:06 Getting my man’s oil changed. And the conservative news has been on this whole hour. I feel like I’ve lost 10 IQ points.
2961 2018-12-11 19:07:04 Thank goodness oil has come down in price otherwise the lower exchange rate would be adding to UK fuel costs for motorists
2962 2018-12-11 19:06:56 Cool! My house smells like lumpia and cooking oil
2963 2018-12-11 19:06:55 Friends of Science!  Hahahahaha. Anyone can Google who you are. Begone, purveyors of falsehoods. Shame on you for the damage you are trying to do to harm our kids' future. You are not truly helping oil workers in the long-run with your deceit.
2964 2018-12-11 19:06:53 But, but BIG COAL!

BIG OIL!  

Who needs clean water and air?!?!
2965 2018-12-11 19:06:45 Ask him what he thinks baby oil is made out of....
2966 2018-12-11 19:06:41 Black Bush is definitely top 10 bro. So many gems in there lmao. Huh? Oil? Wtf? Oil? Oil!? Bitch you cookin!?
2967 2018-12-11 19:06:38 you lying thieving alarmists have been saying the same bullshit for HUNDREDS of years, and youve been wrong EVERY SINGLE TIME. take your regressive tax snake oil and peddle it elsewhere.
2968 2018-12-11 19:06:35 That’s the Reason why I took my gauges off  it was too painful to stretch them any bigger. I tried using lube, coconuts oil, lotion everything and it dint work lol
2969 2018-12-11 19:06:32 it doesn't work that way,  IOC are the exploration coy of this oil,  FG income comes in as a certain % tax on this income. If it's a JV the parties share the proceeds based on equity contribution of both parties.
2970 2018-12-11 19:06:32 Raging, as are @CarolineLucas & others that an important debate on #fuelpoverty cut to an hour due to the #Brexit vote cowardice of the Tory Government. Could have spoken at length about the effects of unfair pricing, heating oil & gas & #UniversalCredit in my constituency alone
2971 2018-12-11 19:06:29 Oh god yeah, like I've said many times it's the housing bubble driving the cdn$ not oil.  Market knows now that as the banks go, markets go.  And banks are getting the snot beat of em on every rip
2972 2018-12-11 19:06:25 What is most sad is that no presidential candidate has come up with a convincing enough blueprint on how to make sure this two sectors grow
2973 2018-12-11 19:06:24 I wash my face with a bar of dove soap and water every night. Then I use the Algenist cleanser with microalgae oil. Finally, I moisturize with philosophy’s renewed hope in a jar lotion every night. Also, I use the moroccan rose shea sugar scrub and exfoliate three times a week.
2974 2018-12-11 19:06:23 WHAT IS PRETTY REDICULOUS IS WHEN I 
GET AN OIL CHANGE OR

GARAGE. SUM OF THESE
RACIST ASSHOLES TRY

HIS PLACE IS ONE OF THE

2975 2018-12-11 19:06:21 "Canada" doesn't but Saudi Oil, companies do. It's capitalism and even with energy east they will continue to do so. Why don't you lobby Irving Oil to change their buying patterns?
2976 2018-12-11 19:06:21 Powerful companies are slippery. How an O&G company can say it's move from oil to gas is in support of a cyclical economy reducing consumption and promoting wise use and the whole audience is like "yes this is true" is beyond me.
2977 2018-12-11 19:06:18 Hope it has the good oil on Plotly and Leaflet.  Will be having a look anyway.

2980 2018-12-11 19:06:05 Are you planning to drive a lot less next year than you did over the last year? 
Do you see a lot of new oil and gas exploration getting capitalized? 
Think political and economic stability in Russia and Saudi are just fine and not likely to experience any bumps in the road?
2981 2018-12-11 19:06:05 It wasn't the inconvenience but more the sheer panic of seeing an open pit of inflammable oil bext to gas mains left uncovered 4 4-days inc unmanned over a w/e which if ignited would have caused half street+@peckhamlevels 2b blown to pieces..!
2982 2018-12-11 19:05:57 WTF is talking about equalization? Where did I speak to that? Are you so biased you can’t follow  a conversation? The question is about profitable oil. Nothing to do with equalization.

The president doesn't know info. infiltrates so fast than when he remembers of '70s.
2988 2018-12-11 19:05:27 Firstly don't assume I'm English, secondly you can keep your dwindling oil ( extracted by British petroleum ) and we'll stop paying you the Barnett formula or whatever it is ... see how you fund your education and prescriptions then.
2989 2018-12-11 19:05:26 Everyone keeps asking me what I want for Christmas. Well what I really need is an oil change, new windshield wipers, gas money, groceries and more CBD oil. But I don’t think those answers go over well usually

3045 2018-12-11 19:01:35 don't get me started on appeasing Quebec - but nice deflection all the same.
We're talking about how oil demands tax breaks and concessions and overcharges us for their product. Worse, they demand we pay so they can sell their crap. And as I said - Alberta is owed $35 Bil by oil.

3073 2018-12-11 18:59:37 As I said Hypocrisy, they’ll accept oil on tankers and trucks and trains but build a brand new pipeline beside an existing pipeline (in BCs case) to ship oil that wasn’t produced in a country that treats women like dogs and suddenly they’re against oil.
3074 2018-12-11 18:59:36 The United States turned into a net oil exporter last week, breaking 75 years of continued dependence on foreign oil and marking a pivotal — though likely brief — moment toward what President Trump has branded as "energy independence."

Yup 'turn the other cheek' people, whilst we apply Luke 19:27 to you, unless you 'submit to us in everything', give us oil etc
3090 2018-12-11 18:58:10 Well, in front of the cameras, anyway
3091 2018-12-11 18:58:09 This will hurt poor people! Affordable and reliable energy will help the poor, not rich people driving around in Tesla powered by oil and natural gas electricity via charging stations.

"Quite frankly it is quite perverse that we are selling our oil in Alberta for $10 a barrel and then in eastern Canada we are importing from places like Saudi Arabia. This makes no sense."
3093 2018-12-11 18:57:58 Try this for size 
Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund, until recently it had the publisher of the National Enquirer on its board, it has a mandate to support the oil companies and is working to introduce American style conservatism to Canada. It is propaganda, not news.
3094 2018-12-11 18:57:49 time to log in and see whether my crew pulled off our brazilian oil heist that i've masterminded over the past year. let me just take a big sip of coffee first. before i check my messages let me check the environmental news as i have this coffee in my mouth
3095 2018-12-11 18:57:46 "for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, we must end the age of oil in our time."-Barack Hussein Obama 2008...Ten years later he takes credit for the US becoming world's largest producer of oil.
3096 2018-12-11 18:57:44 Petro Canada does not use Saudi oil look it up.
3097 2018-12-11 18:57:37 You people have no fucking clue as to what's needed. 
Climate change is happening exponentially and you want to push a guy on us who's bought off by big oil? 
The stupidity of the general American electorate is stunning.

3104 2018-12-11 18:57:21 Oil is the root of this modern evil
3105 2018-12-11 18:57:18 Good for you, and like I said not about the economics for me, but you keep bringing up oil, gas resources.
3106 2018-12-11 18:57:09 Tax bill has brought manufacturing AND JOBS back to the states, we're energy independent and putting pressure on Russia with our oil production, peace on the Korean peninsula for the first time since..., and much much more.
3107 2018-12-11 18:57:05 Also try just straight coconut oil for lip balm.
3108 2018-12-11 18:57:02 That is a fact. Chicken wings taste like they were fried in oil. It is unreal.
3109 2018-12-11 18:56:59 Looks like bonds were smarter this morning, rallying as equity indices were positive.  Volatility in stocks remains crazy and machine generated trades are out of control, but fundamentals ultimately win.  COMMODEX closed out shorts in crude oil last night, saving about 50 cents!
3110 2018-12-11 18:56:52 Oh I don’t need to educate myself about the political structure and history of this country cause I had a very good government teacher..... The north has brought more harm than good to the image of this country, Nigeria is ranked number two among the most terrorized countries
3111 2018-12-11 18:56:48 To who? They already have suppliers. Who you going to sell to? Who? Is there an unexplored region of the world clamoring for our oil? Do you think the Americans will let it happen? Undermine their agreements with SA? Why don’t you try with America? Market prices. Stand up to them
3112 2018-12-11 18:56:46 Oil, it's link to horrifying climate destruction (& all feedback externalities that can occur through the increasing scarcity of resources), it's link to the petrodollar and the US's military spending and budget deficit, as well as it leading the the "coincidental" conquering ...
3113 2018-12-11 18:56:44 and when Scotland is independent, the oil and most of the gas will remain in the Scottish sector of the north-sea, adjacent to that of Norway.

3116 2018-12-11 18:56:32 2019 will really be a largely uncertain year for Nigerian bank. If oil prices fail to hit minimum $80 per barrel, then its a panic moment. And yes, devaluation might crip in. Also, @OPEC wount pamper us again. Signs of the times.
3117 2018-12-11 18:56:32 Thanks to Obama! Increase independence of other countries for oil and steel. The education quality of schools dropped dramatically under common core. Obama did his best to make us the 20th best nation.
3118 2018-12-11 18:56:32 I need some oil hardened drivers  could def use that extra 20
3119 2018-12-11 18:56:25 oh that's so weird. I've never heard of shampoo doing that before :o I wash mine every second day (so wash, one day break, wash again, just to not dry out my scalp too much bc I have the excessive oil problem + thin hair = bad times) I'm sure there are some though!!)

3133 2018-12-11 18:55:15 This is distinct from large contributions; that's an easy case to make.
You can certainly argue that officials elected in states with big oil will have a hard time balancing repping voters & the environment. The TX electorate has a conflict of interest.
3134 2018-12-11 18:55:13 I keep hearing we have “22million illegal immigrants” living in this country, so we have to do something. Btw most of the reason people flee here is because the US has destabilized their countries for oil & other natural resources
3135 2018-12-11 18:55:06 Possibly. Either way it's because people hate our Arab oil money and because he left Liverpool.
3136 2018-12-11 18:55:05 LVE my PowerLips colors! LVE  that they contain Vitamin E, Avocado oil & beeswax to moisturize your lips and stay on at least 8hrs. Take advantage of this special pricing
3137 2018-12-11 18:55:00 His snake oil was to use quantitative easing to buy back our own debt with newly printed money to fake low interest rates. That BS is now over, so we're learning to live in a real fiscal  world,  and not Barry's narcissistic global monopoly fantasy.

3139 2018-12-11 18:54:47 Oil is going the way of the dodo bird as it should. Time to adapt and look elsewhere. The Tax free glory days were great for Alberta when oil was $135 a barrel, but they should have saved something for a rainy day.
3140 2018-12-11 18:54:40 I've been saying for over a decade that this is what they want.  Theyre not stupid or in denial.  There is oil under there and its becoming easily accessible. They dont care as long as they can profit from it.
3141 2018-12-11 18:54:39 If your claims are unreasonable your company is probably unreasonable. Work with companies that are transparent, ambitious and realistic bc there’s a lot of snake oil out there says Ms. Guo. #wsjcyber

3143 2018-12-11 18:54:30 IIRC, land use intensity of energy goes something like nuclear < geothermal < gas < oil < coal < solar < wind <<<<<<< bioenergy. 

Harder to compare across sectors/carriers but still.

right @J_Lovering @TheHernandezLab @MarianSwain?
3144 2018-12-11 18:54:22 that place we went to get my oil changed forever ago the yellow place. i think they cheaper

3146 2018-12-11 18:54:20 We need to stop logging of rainforests & plowing of boreal forests for tar sand oil !

AM: They're *very* good at oil changes
Me: [aneurysm]
3153 2018-12-11 18:53:52 Of course its not, taxing people for corporate lies will never work, cars can get over 100 mpg do they, no big oil stops that, electric, heating your house, and cars all can run on 0 point energy, clean no pollution no fossil fuels required, do we use it, no its hidden from us.
3154 2018-12-11 18:53:52 Although, I have a squeeze bottle of almond oil in the shower that I use to shave my legs. It works pretty well.
3155 2018-12-11 18:53:51 I agree. Trying to assign *millions of dollars* worth of value to something like under anything other than user retention this is legitimately snake oil salesman shit.

3160 2018-12-11 18:53:27 Tea tree oil helps a lot. Take a small cup and add a few drops and take a q-tip and apply throughout the day.
3161 2018-12-11 18:53:27 I know from the research done by campaign finance journalists, with data from a campaign finance monitoring nonprofit, in the link above. again, it's just *the large dollar oil and gas executive donors* and the PLEDGE he signed!
3162 2018-12-11 18:53:21 Idk but he’s all about resistance and performance. He’s basically high quality motor oil.

3164 2018-12-11 18:53:16 EIA projects 200kbd lower 48 crude oil growth Nov 18- Jan 19. Which I find ridiculous. My guess based would be -100kbd drop. Will have a better estimate I see the November completions in the DPR.
3165 2018-12-11 18:53:08 I KNOW isn’t it so pretty?!? I love them both so much so idk what to get!! I’ve never had anything fun in my hair before so I’m so excited haha. The oil slick is more risky, because if I don’t like it then I’m sorta stuck with it for a while  I think I’ll love it though!

3169 2018-12-11 18:52:44 Here's my experience. When we were hitting "peak oil" there was panic because we weren't going to get enough oil out of the ground fast enough. Now, not that many years later, people panic because they think in 20 years we won't need oil. They are wrong.
3170 2018-12-11 18:52:43 Sir, onion & tomatoes are damn cheap! Main reason in my opinion is Petrol price! Food inflation is lowest! Congress made fool of people by raising price of oil & Raffaele corruption! Speak lies after lies and people start believing!

3172 2018-12-11 18:52:23 Q5 I also brought in an oil diffuser to the office for my life stresses at work. (just bought my first home). The smell makes me happy and has others stopping by to chat because they like what they smell too #happynose #happylife #AcAdv
3173 2018-12-11 18:52:19 It's OK. Thanks to vote fraud, the Democrats no longer have to pander to the public.
3174 2018-12-11 18:52:18 They are leaving it. Take a look at the regimes we have overthrown since 9/11 and are threatening to overthrow now. Abandoned the Petrodollar. China is now trading oil on a gold backed currency. Our currency is backed by the military.
3175 2018-12-11 18:52:17 The “lamps” seem to refer to their lives which are either prepared or unprepared. The “oil” refers to that which prepares them to give forth light and may properly be illustrative of the regeneration of the Holy Spirit.
3176 2018-12-11 18:52:02 How? Explain.
3177 2018-12-11 18:51:57 In what form will it take , will it be in pill or oil form and not in smokable form?
3178 2018-12-11 18:51:41 US Energy Information Administration expects Brent spot prices will average $61 in 2019. 
EIA expects that U.S. crude oil production will average 10.9 million b/d in 2018, up from 9.4 million b/d in 2017, and will average 12.1 million b/d in 2019.
3179 2018-12-11 18:51:37 His outrage keeps changing. 1st all oil/gas money=bad. You shot that down, so it's only money from execs=bad. Asked why execs can't donate like everyone else, he said maxing out is the problem. Of course, he has no idea what he's talking about.
3180 2018-12-11 18:51:37 Oil money. Follow the trail. Oil money buys the politicians and they become compromised. Then whilst the west burns they release statements about "peaceful" muslims....

3212 2018-12-11 18:48:55 deeper than gas/oil. middle eastern re-alignment leading to global re-alignment, but yes hurt trump who is the initiator of same.

3215 2018-12-11 18:48:45 In the future, having limited resources as we do, clean air, water, food, etc will be for those that can afford it. Think war over oil is bad? Try war in order to survive.....

3219 2018-12-11 18:48:22 Including #military bases, UN votes, or access to oil and other natural resources.
3220 2018-12-11 18:48:18 It took me a week (while travelling to and staying at my in-laws) to write a monthly client update about how we were down in Nov long oil and gas, short Tesla and these moves will continue. 
#RatherHaveARootCanal
3221 2018-12-11 18:48:09 While it may recycle the water, they produce ALOT of emission, they burn basically crude oil. Ships are the worst polluters :(
3222 2018-12-11 18:48:08 We gave $500 to Beto’s campaign over a year and all the Bernie supporters are claiming only rich people do that! My husband is a modest employee in an oil company and I’m a social worker. Never knew we were the ruling class!
3223 2018-12-11 18:48:06 Nope, I can see this has been a huge waste of time. It’s about Canadians cooperating with other Canadians, Quebec gets equalization payments and revenue from pipelines and oil jobs and in return they help us move our oil (see Manitoba). Maybe Quebec didn’t watch Sesame Street.
3224 2018-12-11 18:48:04 Ya all going far... Try groundnut oil popularly known as ororo

Plus facewipes are still the plug for all make up
3225 2018-12-11 18:48:01 me: oil lamps always remind me of star wars.
my brother, visibly tired: EVERYTHING reminds you of star wars.
3226 2018-12-11 18:47:54 You mean ANY kind of legislation. Except for the Tax Scam. Thanks for that. Please stop this senseless oil search, raping our lands, air, and waters, must stop. Oil and coal, must be a thing of the past, please look to the future.
3227 2018-12-11 18:47:49 ‘sorry, do you have any black pepper and chilli oil to go with this?’ - me, about to suck dick
3228 2018-12-11 18:47:45 I'm using my daughter's account atm ..wth do you think the taxpayers are doing right now for the Alta oil workers through taxpayer funding of subsidies etc the Alta entitlement mentality won't let you see you see the support in handouts you get already
3229 2018-12-11 18:47:41 Well you should educate yourself about the politics of Nigeria from first to fourth republic before you spew axioms without proof misleading your likes.
3230 2018-12-11 18:47:33 For the love of money. It’s not like we need new oil is it?
3231 2018-12-11 18:47:29 Part of the year for around 63-65 dollars. If you minus the benchmark from the actual sales you are talking about 18 dollar differential. $18 times 361= 6498. Times this figures times 2 million which is our standard daily oil exploration then times that figure times 365
3232 2018-12-11 18:47:19 Lol. Same. I may need to play it this weekend. I never was able to get past the oil rig level though. So I have yet to beat this game. Now, that needs to change.
3233 2018-12-11 18:47:06 Any fatty oil; coconut, olive, butter
3234 2018-12-11 18:47:04 That is not the issue. The issue is people supporting a greater cause when they are really looking at their own self interest. Btw - I support Alberta oil over any other country's.
3235 2018-12-11 18:47:03 Middle East Country.  You want as many as Five Appointments and that while Middle East Countries Don't have the Budget to take care of the Bankruptcy, Middle East Companies do and you want to make a Patrnership with them.  So Saudi Arabia Oil Companies like Saudi Aramco and you
3236 2018-12-11 18:47:02 Why Trump pulling more troops out of Africa - here it is: "The U.S.’s economic influence has been waning in Africa for years, driven by a decrease in crude oil exports from the continent that began in 2011." -USN
3237 2018-12-11 18:47:01 Incidentally, Norway doesn't run at a deficit. It only borrows money to maintain its AAA rating. It invested its oil and gas wealth for future generations, with less oil and gas resources than Scotland.
3238 2018-12-11 18:46:59 It’s funny to think about how there’s a chance Oil City Roadhouse (or was it Knoxville’s already?) had a hand in the Oilers winning the McDavid lottery.
3239 2018-12-11 18:46:51 There’s different types lol there’s liquids, soaps, oils, even wipes. I personally just take off my makeup with coconut oil and then wash my face after
3240 2018-12-11 18:46:40 It only gets worse from here. Uncharacteristically, the O+G (production) industry is not fooling itself this time around, and has correctly seen that investment levels, given oil's demand growth outlook, need to be lower. Permanently lower. I can't see any growth for the OSX.
3241 2018-12-11 18:46:38 it smells like eucalyptus oil in the tire shop rn????? who tf doin yoga with all these michelins in here fam
3242 2018-12-11 18:46:31 with cia, the card now want,
solve starvation in the World.
but they made a deal from long,
size conserves [of fish] of gold,
in olive oil, that colomb,
one in its peak, to Noah, brought!
3243 2018-12-11 18:46:27 Jiffy Lube Want $86 For a Oil Change ! anywhere else I can go ? Could do it myself but ion have the time
3244 2018-12-11 18:46:20 Yea they also think we are wayward and not good upstairs both islamically n d other, till they see us in Qur'an competition
3245 2018-12-11 18:46:20 The Flames went on a similar run after beating the Oilers, The Oil need to stop losing to WC teams.
3246 2018-12-11 18:46:15 The majority of the oil industry people I've known in my almost 60 years here value their paycheck more than the environment. And let's be honest. No real "tree hugger" would work for Exxon.
3247 2018-12-11 18:46:05 Oil rig workers make good money.
3248 2018-12-11 18:45:54 Beto took almost $500K from big oil last cycle and he had pledged to take none.  #NeverBeto #NeOliver also
3249 2018-12-11 18:45:42 Reserve story is this govt woes absolvency(permit my weak attempt at neologism) narrative. Hw much is the price of oil in d last 18 months, LLNG money n recovered loots through their celebrated plea bargain that were claimed to reduces landmark prosecution. APC is a scam!
3250 2018-12-11 18:45:41 What disease can be treated with peppermint oil?
3251 2018-12-11 18:45:05 I've just ordered my first CBD oil to hopefully manage chronic neuropathy. Has anyone else used this to good effect?
3252 2018-12-11 18:45:03 No - I welcome it and think it’s a big step forward toward genuinely sustainable palm oil.
3253 2018-12-11 18:44:57 British Petroleum's Statistical Review of World Energy has shown a steady decline in both total oil consumption, and oil consumption as a % of energy consumption, across the developed world, beginning in the 2000s, and continuing today. Just the facts. #cdnpoli
3254 2018-12-11 18:44:43 Actually under Harper a bunch of oil companies were expanding and pipelines were in the works. JT was beginning to look like he would become PM in 2015, so companies bailed. He has vetoed every important pipeline and caused the oil industry to decline in Alberta.
3255 2018-12-11 18:44:36 #UKOG #HORSEHILL.

Crude Oil Tanker number 100 isn't far away.

What a fantastic milestone this will be!
3256 2018-12-11 18:44:35 Purified water taste like oil
3257 2018-12-11 18:44:35 We love you "Oil Tot"! And besides your stuck with me rather you like it or love it for all of your 122 years of life. Hugs for "Oil Tot"!
3258 2018-12-11 18:44:27 Any comparison with all Senate races is an automatic FAIL, because you can't normalize against zero oil employment.
Show your work. State your assumptions. Be very careful in stating what your stats actually mean. That can be hard, because of the underlying complexity.
3259 2018-12-11 18:44:23 Oil reporter Barmer check ... Refineries don't get you votes  INC. Won one assembly constituency after hurried foundation stone laying ceremony. Delaying, restarting and work i n prog and this time BJP has also scraped through in just 1 constituency
3260 2018-12-11 18:43:58 Fammmmmm nothing truer 
When I don't use any cream or oil 
I turn out to be more white
3261 2018-12-11 18:43:53 Can also show us our foreign reserve in 2010, in April 2015, and today? And tell us d price of crude oil from Jan 2011 to April 2015, and from May 2015 to date?
3262 2018-12-11 18:43:50 Now, the only reason for butt-hurting from any public official of the USA is:

The proven oil reserves in Venezuela are recognized as the largest in the world, totaling 297 billion barrels (4.72×1010 m3) as of 1 January 2014.
3263 2018-12-11 18:43:39 Abdusalami: Return to Civil Rule; Obasanjo: Debt Forgiveness; Yar'Adua: Oil Derivation; Jonathan: Handover to Opposition; Buhari: Hijacked Government
3264 2018-12-11 18:43:37 Why do they even have to be graded like they are wine or something 

Welcome back..... It's vegetable oil after all
3265 2018-12-11 18:43:34 It would be one a landlocked country. Hiw would it get its oil across Canada? This is the stupidest thing I have ever heard. But keep spreading divisive rhetoric like all CONServatives. Unity is something CONServatives don't ever preach.
3266 2018-12-11 18:43:25 Moat Cailin! It's basalt appearing to be covered in greasy black oil.
3267 2018-12-11 18:43:22 People say I smell like really good smelling weed all the time  I wear kush oil perfumes in the winter.
3268 2018-12-11 18:43:17 A lot of the chewy stuff isn't veggie & many contain coconut oil, which I'm allergic to, so I stay away from most of those as I like being alive 
3269 2018-12-11 18:43:16 Wait is there a difference between Jamaican black caster oil and regular castor oil??
3270 2018-12-11 18:43:15 Yeah I think it's based on last years income data... so even with oil diving now it makes no difference
3271 2018-12-11 18:43:00 Hahaha. I think your bar is way too high. How search engines work (even at a high level) is not trivial, it's domain knowledge.

It's like "How oil rigs work" would seem basic to those in the field.

BTW, I think she was just cross-examining him, she's sort of on his side.
3272 2018-12-11 18:42:54 That's because money is the only thing you guys have.
Your country is like hell, from the 4th century BC.
But hey, a lot of oil and money ~
3273 2018-12-11 18:42:52 Thing is, Ukraine and Russia got on fine until the US fucked things up.  Why? US, EU want Ukraine in EU and NATO, as well as access to oil, gas in Black Sea. US did not like it when Yanukovich agreed to economic deal w/Putin. US had operatives in place, then the Maidan happened.
3274 2018-12-11 18:42:48 Shame we’ve had to devalue our currency by 20% , oil almost at the price it was when we were paying a £ a litre . Imagine what’ll happen when it goes up . The BofE should of propped it up and then you would of had your recession . Then maybe seen some sense !
3275 2018-12-11 18:42:42 Are you under the impression that Saudi oil is better for the environment than Alberta oil?  What about the human rights angle? Do you prefer Saudi values over ours? 

Sincere question.
3276 2018-12-11 18:42:21 Let me explain certain things to you and try and be open minded. You see let's start by saying there was mismanagement under PDP. Haven said that. Let's analyze a single calendar year under Buhari. In 2017, the bench mark of crude oil was 44.5 while crude oil was sold in most
3277 2018-12-11 18:42:15 No, their will always be laborers. Some will work for money, others for food, shelter etc. Govt needs money, it doesn't produce anything. It does take things like oil/gas in Venezuela....and you can see how that's going for yourself.
3278 2018-12-11 18:42:14 Já procurei tudo, Blackstar Oil Company, e essas porra KKK só acredito vendo o dinheiro na conta
3279 2018-12-11 18:42:09 Na real é black star oil company não?
3280 2018-12-11 18:42:03 The article is from May 2018, oil prices plunged in Sept. There are 2 ways to see reality: by looking at old news, or by doing an analysis based on commodity prices, real estate, and by talking to people, particularly in retail biz. Take a walk DT YYC to check all stores closing
3281 2018-12-11 18:41:48 Government-sanctioned meth is OK but CBD oil makes you a drug seeking junkie, probably on heroin too amirite?
3282 2018-12-11 18:41:48 Getting your oil changed alone as a woman fuckin BLOWS MAN.
3283 2018-12-11 18:41:39 Bakery and “Cakery” zone 
3284 2018-12-11 18:41:28 I never measured anything I'm afraid. I just poured out some oil and added handfuls of the flours and then added a bit of warm water to bring it all together. I think if you google you'll find some recipes if you want exact amounts.
3285 2018-12-11 18:41:22 願い事が叶うならば石油王になりたい…

3290 2018-12-11 18:40:52 Great snake oil.  
3291 2018-12-11 18:40:44 I think anyone outside of NY, NJ and CT who believed one word Trump said were being played. He is the ultimate con man. The consummate snake oil salesman. Lonesome Rhodes writ large. As you know, it’s the role he’s played all his life. Had he not been born rich, he’d be in jail.
3292 2018-12-11 18:40:38 just make a beet palya. oil, urad dal, mustard seeds, curry leaves, hing - sputter, throw in chopped beets, salt, turmeric, green chllies, beet softens. eat with thair saadam, and oorgai
3293 2018-12-11 18:40:29 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
3294 2018-12-11 18:40:29 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

3296 2018-12-11 18:40:18 I just paid 80 dollars for an oil change that I could have done myself but I hate the cold 
3297 2018-12-11 18:40:09 知ってる？スーパーってタダで牛脂くれるんだよ。
3298 2018-12-11 18:40:05 sunflower syrum by @BAHICOSMETICS or mario bedascu has a vitamin c syrum... oR... just vitamin E oil, i bought mine at walmart for $6
3299 2018-12-11 18:40:05 No, this is a false narrative hawked by Berners. Beto took 0 pac money of any kind.

He did receive money from oil and gas EMPLOYEES, which is unsurprising in Texas. He was also the #1 recipient of money from labor & education; in fact he was #1 in every sector.
3300 2018-12-11 18:39:54 I would love to see the gov stop selling arms AND stop buying oil. Saudi Arabia is one of the worst human abusers in the world. I would also like to see our gov condemn Iran.
3301 2018-12-11 18:39:51 Use hot cooking oil 
3302 2018-12-11 18:39:41 No way he/she still around but that car gotta be close by it lost waaaayyyy too much oil to keep moving
3303 2018-12-11 18:39:36 Coconut oil is definitely too heavy for her thin follicles.  Try sweet almond oil or jojoba oil. And start with very little . It very easy to put too much
3304 2018-12-11 18:39:36 lol , I like the oil prices , filled my truck up yesterday @ 1.97 a gallon cost only 64$
3305 2018-12-11 18:39:32 smart cats know that when Mr. Drumpf tries to formulate a clear sentence, a russian bot dreams about being a #Democrat

3308 2018-12-11 18:39:24 240 decible underwater blasts several times a minute that can be heard hundreds of miles away in the territory of endangered animals with extraordinarily sensitive hearing so you can more effectively pinpoint where to cause the next giant oil spill is straight up evil.
3309 2018-12-11 18:39:14 You can’t get a Teaching job on campus or a science grant unless you support climate change scam.
3310 2018-12-11 18:39:02 I see it as desperately trying to save the oil industry, which, like the Republican Party, has a foreseeable conclusion to its existence. If the same amt of effort  & $ was put into renewable resources we’d be carbon emission free by now.
3311 2018-12-11 18:39:02 Funny how you can only find negatives. So what?

Nb Thatcher chose to waste our North Sea oil bonanza while Norway created a sovereign wealth fund!
3312 2018-12-11 18:38:59 Another v good day in the making:
-found an espresso machine in the alley
-am gonna write a poem about things the alley has given me
-folded some laundry
-am washing my hair w a ton of tea tree oil bc this dandruff is getting out of hand
3313 2018-12-11 18:38:56 are you a gouache sapphic or an oil pastel sapphic? a mossy prehensile-tailed gecko sapphic or a fire skink sapphic?
3314 2018-12-11 18:38:52 Im gonna miss you @Hersheys - but I will no longer buy products with palm oil. The use of palm oil is destroying rainforests, and driving orangutans to extinction. Plz find a way to stop using it. 
Til then, goodbye.
3315 2018-12-11 18:38:32 You can see the oil spot on top left shoulder 
3316 2018-12-11 18:38:29 You should check the meaning of atrocities before you jump the gun!

3319 2018-12-11 18:38:21 Even though the “fundamentals” of Oil are improving, especially with the OPEC cut they sure want to tank it below $50
3320 2018-12-11 18:38:21 might eff around and call my dad to see if he’s checked his oil lately
3321 2018-12-11 18:38:14 Black star oil company existe, já tinha ouvido falar antes, agr em relação a proposta, eu não sei
3322 2018-12-11 18:38:04 And who gives them right to grab oil that doesn’t belong to the USA ?
3323 2018-12-11 18:37:54 I suppose by Donald’s logic he doesn’t need Canada’s oil either. Keeping that along with their dairy products, imagine such a thing!
3324 2018-12-11 18:37:48 #Amazon is loaded with oil.
3325 2018-12-11 18:37:46 Imagine having the gall to stand up at a climate conference and brag about the United States becoming the largest oil and gas producer in the world.
3326 2018-12-11 18:37:43 Lots of goodies still in my shop and everything ships free this week! Cinnamon Spice Lip Scrub, Pumpkin Soap, Candy Cane body butter, lavender pillow spray, pumpkin cheesecake lip balm, beard oil and lots more! #freeshipping
3327 2018-12-11 18:37:24 My husband, who is an employee not an executive, donated $500 to Beto. He works for an oil company. Over 300,000 Texans work for oil/gas and related industries. This is not news, this is a hit job by Bernie’s sore loser supporters. Get ready for another loss, Bernie cult.
3328 2018-12-11 18:37:02 This policy by @johnmcdonnellMP, in no uncertain terms, puts our planet and the welfare of everyone in it at risk. The price and scarcity of oil (as well as the existance of monsters with no shame or empathy for human life in US politics and certain corporations) ...
3329 2018-12-11 18:36:52 Stupid idea. They’re too absorbent and will just suck up oil.
3330 2018-12-11 18:36:39 Yes, the real housewives purchasing a G class are very concerned about its off roading capability. They schedule in some mudding in between yoga class and their essential oil inventory pickup.
3331 2018-12-11 18:36:37 Problem is the Trudeau family who wants to create artificial conflicts instead of putting people to work. Under Harper we had none of these shenanigans because he had a clear focus on growth. Now the oil workers are reassigned to the toxic pot growing industry!
3332 2018-12-11 18:36:30 What?  Anti-pipeline, carbon tax that pushed many oil companies out of the province and not fighting for our oil industry with the Feds is pro oil??
3333 2018-12-11 18:36:08 отказаться! Stratagem of using Trump piece on global chess board has ended in stalemate & pointless material loss. Perhaps, leaders of U.S. will providing us meeting with oil and gas bosses? We are confident we will return board to "usual as business" as Amerikanski say. 
3334 2018-12-11 18:36:01 Americans should never complain about other countries military... Over the last decades Americans have been all around the world bombing innocent people for oil or because you didn't like their governments.....you are either clueless on history or you just spread propaganda
3335 2018-12-11 18:35:55 orange essential oil is my favorite bc it’s just limonene which is basically as flammable as anything can ever be

3337 2018-12-11 18:35:43 I was using coconut oil but when I put oil in, because it’s so thin, she it she looks like a greaseball  using extra conditioners and lightly rinsing and adding conditioning spray after usually works great for that...but I’ve yet to find an oil that works for her
3338 2018-12-11 18:35:41 Alberta is highest Canada unemployment 8’/.  100,000 People 
Most of money going to Quebec is Dreaded Oil Money & Alberta’s only customer is USA who sell oil to Que along with killer Saudi Sheiks
Que uses 355,000 barrels Foreign Gasoline a day yet block a Canadian Oil Pipeline
3339 2018-12-11 18:35:33 The oil !  I wanna try it too !
3340 2018-12-11 18:35:30 How much of the UK's #GDP comes from fishing? Asking for a rich #Tory oil & gas magnate from Aberdeen.
3341 2018-12-11 18:35:28 #OOTT #RussianFarEast Crude oil export from Russian Far East in November was
Kozmino 622 kbl/d vs Oct 669 kbl/d  (ESPO crude API 32-34)
De Kastri 258L vs Oct 296 Kbl/d (Sokol crude 38-40 API)
combined 880K vs Oct 965Kbl/d

Not counting Sakhalin export  gas condensate/crude
3342 2018-12-11 18:35:27 South Africa needs to catch up and quickly. The govt could forge a huge taxation stream from the domestic legalisation of medicinal canna and the export of 'any' canna (med or rec'al), bringing in huge amts of foreign currency & being world leader in top quality medicinal oil
3343 2018-12-11 18:35:26 前にも似たようなこと言ったな？
3344 2018-12-11 18:35:25 Koch, Trump, Putin, Saudi gas/oil industry. We as governments need to reign in their greed by using fear of extinction from #climatechange.
3345 2018-12-11 18:35:25 Easy answer...NO! What in his real estate career and histories of bankruptcies would even hint at such expertise? NOTHING. He is a snake oil salesman, flimflam man.

3348 2018-12-11 18:35:15 Great Marya thanks,, although I'm unclear from your answer whether some of your products do contain Palm oil from unsustainable sources? As many people boycotting these products would be helpful to distinguish.
3349 2018-12-11 18:35:12 If the NB government is pushing for AB oil, you better believe that Irving wants it. I would think that they would be pushing the Premier to get AB oil through to their refineries.
3350 2018-12-11 18:35:11 My dad could not wait to take early retirement after 30 odd years as a postman the company is not the same anymore thanks to the Tories privatised the company  the break up of the monopoly bring back royal mail ,gas trains ,oil ,water back to the public
3351 2018-12-11 18:35:08 Safety net for farmers... entitlement. Subsidies for big oil.. entitlement. Handouts to automotive.. entitlement.. that's a lot of $$, but we balk at taking care of the majority of the American people with social security and Medicare.. earned benefit!! #MSNBC
3352 2018-12-11 18:35:05 Transport Canada estimates that there are about 20,000 oil tanker movements off the coasts of Canada each year. Of these, approximately 17,000 (85%) are on the Atlantic coast. #realitycheck #letsusefacts Only 2% of the oil shipped as cargo in Canadian waters is on Pacific coast.

3354 2018-12-11 18:34:58 Doing just what #Oil companies do, buy established businesses for profitable gains. Then when it becomes to much hassle, sell off leaving it worse than when they bought it.  We have personally seen it so many times.
3355 2018-12-11 18:34:57 1. You can lose belly fat by eating almonds every day.

2. To lose more weight quickly, drink about 2-3 cup of green tea each day.

3. Make your hair softer by massaging coconut oil into your scalp.
3356 2018-12-11 18:34:56 Update on Sam. 
He is unblocked, passing the oil, standing up and wanting to eat!
Thank You Lord!!
3357 2018-12-11 18:34:54 "Britain is pushing ahead with gas fracking, Norway with oil exploration in the Arctic, and the German government wants to tear down Hambach forest to dig for coal." And that's just 3 European countries... #environment Why not invest in eco-friendly solutions? Lobbyists?

3360 2018-12-11 18:34:29 And today they're proudly pretending they never wrote it while taking up Sirota's "Beto took oil money!" thread.
3361 2018-12-11 18:34:29 Alberta oil to developing 3rd world countries for an ethical, sustainable energy source-BAD / BC coal to China ,an egregious  emissions giant- GOOD
3362 2018-12-11 18:34:24 There was a perfume once that smelled to me like old leather-bound books and to my husband like motor oil. It was the perfect scent for us. I never bought any because it was too expensive but I still regret it.
3363 2018-12-11 18:34:21 Maybe the CBC can stop hoodwinking the Canadian public and stop overrepresented the oil/tar tycoons and actually start presenting good scientific analysis on the environment. Shame on CBC for continuing their slanted misinformation.
3364 2018-12-11 18:34:18 tomorrow I'm rubbing groundnut oil on my face, I need to snap my own sun kissed picture
3365 2018-12-11 18:34:18 wow so i came to work and started to bless the office with some oil. and turns out everybody here does witchcraft too
3366 2018-12-11 18:34:17 I would rather that school shootings didn’t happen than you being able to get a hard on over the smell of gun oil.
3367 2018-12-11 18:34:09 We can tinker with this stuff in the West because we're rich and can back "renewables" with fossil fuels. African countries can't do that. They need cheap, abundant oil. It's literally life and death for them.
3368 2018-12-11 18:33:56 Dire, I assume you are using oil and not flowers?

3371 2018-12-11 18:33:14 I only drink motor oil and I drink it out of a taxidermy badger
3372 2018-12-11 18:33:13 Absolutely there is a problem with the math scores in Alberta.  How you think that connects to the oil and gas issues Alberta is facing escapes me.
3373 2018-12-11 18:33:03 I came for an oil change and I’ve been here TWO HOURS 
3374 2018-12-11 18:32:53 Breaking it's not lot's of oilfields, Scotland is sitting on top of ONE big F*CKING Oil Field
3375 2018-12-11 18:32:52 It's ok they put Castro on the cover something like 9 times. Hitler 2 times and Stalin 1 time....par for the course
3376 2018-12-11 18:32:51 When you get right down to it, this is about the Pelosi-est way to approach this. The optics are amazing.
3377 2018-12-11 18:32:45 Also oil & gas services we work together with Haliburton
3378 2018-12-11 18:32:43 I use the honey I washed my hair shampoo bar or the Jason and the Argon oil shampoo bar. American cream conditioner. And r&b hair moisturizer. All from lush and then I use a little bit of Moroccan oil.
3379 2018-12-11 18:32:43 Será que essa tal de blackstar oil não é uma MSI da vida que veria só pra uma lavagenzinha?! Tenho minha dúvidas, mas que deixa a gente sonhar, isso deixa !
3380 2018-12-11 18:32:36 Tonight I'll embrace

3383 2018-12-11 18:31:55 So, I can eat palm oil?
3384 2018-12-11 18:31:49 Is that some form of  oil?!
3385 2018-12-11 18:31:48 You'll buy the whole olive oil popcorn! but you'll only need the EDGE!
3386 2018-12-11 18:31:30 You guys are getting way ahead of yourselves. First, u need to dissolve yeast in warm water & add sugar, salt, oil, & 3 cups of flour all in a large bowl. Then, knead your surface, divide the dough in half, cover, & bake at 375 for 30-35 minutes. Only then can you get this bread

3389 2018-12-11 18:31:16 You people believe on his promises. Thank una God that they didn't find oil in the Chad basin
3390 2018-12-11 18:31:09 That is hard to determine. Subsidy payment like almost everything in Nigeria depends on price of Crude oil (which isn't determined by us) and Exchange rate. Higher crude oil price and/or dollar price means higher landing cost which means higher subsidy payments.
3391 2018-12-11 18:31:07 The continued siege of the coalition forces led to a crisis in oil derivatives, which negatively impacted the performance of media institutions and prevented many of them from continuing #اليوم_العالمي_لحقوق_الإنسان

3393 2018-12-11 18:30:55 oil companies researched the projected effect of their industry in the 80s, knew it, and continued exactly what they were doing anyway bc it would be Worth the Money
3394 2018-12-11 18:30:51 Lamar Smith's scientific knowledge needs peer review, and I don't mean by other 'oil congressmen', but by actual scientists. He can take (and likely fail) my remedial physics course.
3395 2018-12-11 18:30:45 That's a very important point about the wild life sanctuaries and crossings.  It is so necessary to protect the habitat, but Trump is already cancelling a lot of the environmental laws for the benefit of oil companies. Too much shame
3396 2018-12-11 18:30:39 Like you just slid your meat into all natural coconut oil. Be sliding in that pussy to infinity!!!
3397 2018-12-11 18:30:33 I am watching wcs and wti on BNN now. The spread is barely $10.  Are these prices relevant anymore - ie can Alberta oilcos get us$39/bbl for their oil today?  Are there special factors at play?
3398 2018-12-11 18:30:29 Really easy. Just preheat your cast iron skillet a little bit as it takes longer to heat than a regular cookie sheet. I used a bit of vegetable oil inside the pan too.

3406 2018-12-11 18:29:48 @elonmusk Why the eff would would you even agree to do an interview with 60 mins? They don't GaF about the Tesla business model, cool engineering and design. All they care about is exploitation and making you look bad. Just to please their Big Oil Overlords. SMH
3407 2018-12-11 18:29:44 Most butter in the US is terrible, so when we put fat on our sandwiches it comes in from the combination of Oil and Egg. =)
3408 2018-12-11 18:29:43 Finding out the truth about the majority of our olive oil really pissed me off.
3409 2018-12-11 18:29:40 Emigration is organized and funded by certain environments to destroy European civilization. The emigrants are selected by the Islamic countries. Europe is different and alien to them. Why do not they turn to rich Arab countries, oil emirates who have their culture and religion?
3410 2018-12-11 18:29:31 Whatever happened to “Peak Oil?”

Surely the Permian Basin is a dry hole by now!
3411 2018-12-11 18:29:29 This is a *perfect* example of the "budget balancing itself" - according to liberal math. This is how our Finance Ministry works these days. We'll sell our oil for $1/barrel thinking we're getting $99. Can't believe Canadians elected these Retardeaus and Moroneaus
3412 2018-12-11 18:29:28 I made them with coconut oil to counteract that

3434 2018-12-11 18:27:20 Czemu odradzasz bio oil ?
3435 2018-12-11 18:27:09 So a dismantling of all the support systems that allow oil and gas production (e.g. well paid/trained workforce) without thought as to the affects? It's like cutting off your finger because you blackened the nail.
3436 2018-12-11 18:26:38 Oil is at c$60 with 1.9m bpd and FX reserve is at $47bn that's almost 100% increase. It's agreeable the economy ain't doing well. He tried more than any of the past rulers but there are lots of discrepancies.
3437 2018-12-11 18:26:32 Yes, this is an example of the free market going green regardless of what the government is trying to encourage. Big oil lobbying and government intervention is the opposite of the free market.

- it's a mad place. Like when the EU PARL is in Strasbourg, but more culturally diverse and less places to stay
- you can be at COP and know nothing about what's happening. It's like oil and water. Might happen at the same place, but never merge.
3443 2018-12-11 18:26:04 In the Cold War, U.S. companies saw being a global leader in democracy as good for business ( new markets to exploit) now they see money to be made in eeking out the last bit of oil.  Common thread here is profits, everything else is pageantry.
3444 2018-12-11 18:25:59 @DrGundry In a recent podcast with Dr. DiNicolantonio, he spoke about Krill Oil, however; your Omega Advanced pills are Tuna Oil based. Which one is better and why?

3448 2018-12-11 18:25:51 Is there a cap on how much CO2 can be emitted? Do we have a maximum? The consensus from the room is that there's isn't. New fossil fuel source discoveries still take place (USGS recently found new oil source), plus feedback of warming and methane release.
3449 2018-12-11 18:25:40 Quebec would benefit from cheaper Canadian oil to replace expensive American oil.

3452 2018-12-11 18:25:05 So, Russia a country that produces 10,000,000 Barrels of oil per day invested 100 barrels of oil (2016)$$ worth of Google Ads, in hacking the entire democracy of the USA? 
3453 2018-12-11 18:25:00 My personal conspiracy theory is that big oil spends a lot of money on influence, internet trolls and paid commenters to crush the idea of Space Based Solar Power.  Why?  Because if the idea gets traction it will crush their stock prices and ultimately their market.
3454 2018-12-11 18:24:55 @PantherEyez7 Get yourself some Oregano oil caps and Fenu-Thyme. I have allergies and this works best for me! Praise YAH always Sister Tracy. We love you for your courage!

3458 2018-12-11 18:24:40 Alberta has made some progress, but the provinces voters seem to be leaning backwards, rather than forwards, towards upcoming elections, keen to vote for a party which has promised to reduce renewable investment and return to the old way of putting all your eggs in one oil basket

3461 2018-12-11 18:24:33 Hopelessness. And then they go cook food for their families with that oil. Curses galore.

3463 2018-12-11 18:24:29 Food can come from New York and California 
Most of our oil and gas imports come from overseas

What point were you exactly trying to make?
3464 2018-12-11 18:24:22 //funny thing, the phrase stuff them with dates and boiling them spelt in olive oil is a thing from a church play I was in when I was like 13 I guess it really stuck with me xD
3465 2018-12-11 18:24:20 I don’t think it’s oil infused. It’s just really good for detangling
3466 2018-12-11 18:24:15 Oil changes cost way too much for my car . I miss my little 30 dollar oil changes
3467 2018-12-11 18:24:12 Friends! I just successfully ordered oil for my house like an adult 
3468 2018-12-11 18:24:11 @RoxysGrilledChz Hey just curious but what kind of oil does the food truck use to fry in?
3469 2018-12-11 18:24:11 You mean the free market big oil lobby that has bought Congress?
3470 2018-12-11 18:24:11 Well, people didn't buy them... We'd rather scream global warming and drive 13mpg cars, and, scream, global warming...then vote in politicians who'll send kids off to die so we can get more oil (Hillary Clinton anyone?)
3471 2018-12-11 18:24:05 I got out the shower and optioned with 3 diff products. Baby oil gel, Jergens and a body butter. I’m STILL ashy smh 
3472 2018-12-11 18:23:46 Pho. Subway if you stay away from the nitrated meats and most of the sauces. Avoid things that rely on oil to make you feel full - fried food, anything greasy, the fats in sausage/pepperoni/salami/bologna, etc.
3473 2018-12-11 18:23:46 He is doing much better job than what #Venezuela corrupt regime and #Iran corrupt regime do

3475 2018-12-11 18:23:43 The real logical market for their oil is in Asia, and BC is the next door neighbor. You're trying to equate Qc and BC on this issue bit its apples and oranges. BC would benefit from exports Qc wouldn't, etc etc..
3476 2018-12-11 18:23:41 You’d need to consume a gallon of palm oil per day to equate to five showers. One lousy burger is at least seven showers & is part of the increasing carbon footprint issue. To discuss palm oil in the environmentalism sector like it’s a driving cause is ludicrous.
3477 2018-12-11 18:23:35 ゆたくんならいける！
3478 2018-12-11 18:23:24 It's sad than oil and gas is booming around the world while Canada remains in a slump due to different policy choices.  Canada whose main competitive advantage is our best in the world expertise in resources is sitting out the boom.
3479 2018-12-11 18:23:20 We all "know" there isn't going to be any real consequences re the 600,00 barrels of oil that's missing. Donate the $$$$ used to investigate to the poor and move on. "Jamaica politics as usual"
3480 2018-12-11 18:23:18 Yup indeed, the dogs just need a towelling down and thank heavens for pig oil in the winter months for the feathered ponies!
3481 2018-12-11 18:23:11 I just watched a video on one of those monitors at a gas pump about how sweaters that are made for penguins can help keep them safer during oil spills.

That's some slick marketing.
3482 2018-12-11 18:23:01 Um, yes please!! Normally fry with peanut oil because I didn’t know this was a thing.
3483 2018-12-11 18:23:00 Hmmmmmm 

Fine, but if they break your heart, break their fingers and toes then stuff them with dates and boil them slowly in olive oil.
3484 2018-12-11 18:22:59 That’s what I was doing and it just wasn’t moving  probably because she doesn’t have as much natural oil? I’ll add some conditioner and try again lmfao
3485 2018-12-11 18:22:39 For real! In Fiji at most I saw coconut oil being used but that was just for moisturization. I just want to say to those who WANT natural hair(you can have straightened, weave, braids, dreads whateva it's all fine and all up to you) but if you want natural hair it CAN be easy
3486 2018-12-11 18:22:37 I actually don't like Buhari methods,  but truth be told the present admin has managed things well invthier own capacity. Our oil was c$100 and 2,100,000bpd throughout last admin under PDP and our reverse was drained to $24bn. Check these current parameters.
3487 2018-12-11 18:22:34 Financial warfare and complex problem with oil behind it. Socialism in small doses doesn't wreck the economy - financial warfare may be going on all the time.
3488 2018-12-11 18:22:34 Agencies who say without equivocation that Russia used all its power to help you win and you still sell the bottle of snake oil everyday. You have some dumb supporters. What will happen when the sweet deal Jefferey Epstein  got for raping 12 to 14 yo girls is highlighted? Who ...
3489 2018-12-11 18:22:29 I felt defeated after trying to stir the oil into my almond butter 
3490 2018-12-11 18:22:15 Let's see if the US can figure out how to efficiently scale up that algae to oil technology we have. Big Opportunity for us if we can get that done. Look at how well shale based oil has done so far?
3491 2018-12-11 18:22:14 So, one of my friends called me and his cousin was with him in the background. So he asks me how I’m doing and I’m like “eh, I need an oil change” and his cousin goes “see, you DUMB BITCH. You ain’t been checking on her. Her car probably doesn’t even work” 
3492 2018-12-11 18:21:45 So much oil the water just washes off lmao
3493 2018-12-11 18:21:45 me on cbd oil: “How the fuck do I take so much of this stuff that caters towards PTSD veterans and I’m still having mad panic attacks and severe back pain?”

me w/o cbd oil: *cries when I wake up*
3494 2018-12-11 18:21:41 Go all organic (if you’re not already!). Use only coconut, avocado and extra virgin olive oil (no others!). Take vitamin D. That should keep you going!! Lol!

3500 2018-12-11 18:20:49 My favorite chapstick ended up in the wash and dryer with most of my shirts and undies resulting in a lot of oil stains all over my clothes...this kinda sums up how I feel about life right now.
3501 2018-12-11 18:20:36 Because oil companies spend too much money on politicians.
3502 2018-12-11 18:20:31 Ok thank you that’s the oil infused bushes right?
3503 2018-12-11 18:20:30 I’m love the oil

3507 2018-12-11 18:20:10 Nope. Olive oil and maldon, I’m feeling that lazy. Putting up the decorations tonight and drinking some prosecco, just getting on with it.

Oil and Water was ushered in through Banff.
887 is Ex Machina.
Blind Date was a harbourfront creation (post dora win).

Surely to be celebrated but they're exceptions to the rule.

3515 2018-12-11 18:19:56 Let's try to ramp up oil, gas and energy resource production so much that China ends up buying more from us than from the Volatile Middle East.

3519 2018-12-11 18:19:34 My main problem with Hick and fracking is that we need to step away from oil and gas industry to deal with climate change and I am not sure he would
3520 2018-12-11 18:19:22 Let’s tell him they’re interested in oil but need someone with charisma to broker the deal...
3521 2018-12-11 18:19:22 Yes it is frightening ... it hurts a lot ... if you have to watch what is sacrificed to come to oil ... and just deep sea drilling are not controllable we have seen ... but that seems to Trump no matter his ... bad  very bad..

3523 2018-12-11 18:19:09 You’re putting out info as if lobbyist from the oil and gas industry fueled Beto’s campaign. The reality is people that work in the oil & gas industry doing a variety of jobs becuase it’s TX donated to his campaign & listed their industry. Misinformation on purpose is a lie.
3524 2018-12-11 18:19:07 Tomato, I am not sure, is used like this. Usually, grated. And of course, more coconut oil.
3525 2018-12-11 18:19:06 but i dont have any olive oil

3527 2018-12-11 18:19:04 Rachel's hysterical performance for the Oil lobby has made her a truly tragic person. The oil Boyz will never support her and now she has lost her progressive base. She's toast.
3528 2018-12-11 18:18:57 Depends on the car, and type of oil. My BMW was easily a $200 oil change and I don’t live in LA
3529 2018-12-11 18:18:51 Oil demand variance 1% with 25% price move. All other variance small. 
NG demand 10%+ on weather.  3-4% on power burn switch
It's not unreasonable for Nov30 inventory of 2990.
3530 2018-12-11 18:18:49 Good news! Americans get to continue their reliance on blood oil from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela instead of clean, ethically produced Canadian energy!
3531 2018-12-11 18:18:48 I like learning little oddball things that I can use in stories later on. Like today, I learned the Soviet Army circa WWII used a mixture of sunflower oil and kerosene to lubricate weapons and it was highly effective in the cold. Things like this fascinate me. #indieauthor #IARTG
3532 2018-12-11 18:18:44 Wonder what eu is saying behind closed doors to Scottish government.  Our oil. Fish. Water and Renewable . Nice bargaining chips ???

3534 2018-12-11 18:18:42 Can you please share with us the gender analysis report on the Saudi supply of oil?

Thanks.
3535 2018-12-11 18:18:41 I need some snake oil, can you recommend some?
3536 2018-12-11 18:18:41 lol...e say oil
3537 2018-12-11 18:18:36 Campbell wrote the infamous dossier on the threat Iraq posed to the west, saying Iraq could have WMD ready to fire in 30 minutes. He lied about this and many other things. The man is a snake oil salesman!
3538 2018-12-11 18:18:29 I’m getting my oil change rn and I’ve never seen so many Prii.
3539 2018-12-11 18:18:05 I am 99% sure they do not stock Gun Oil in Saino's and also how much do you think I get through?!
3540 2018-12-11 18:18:03 I just realized when I go get an oil change they put stickers on the window telling me how many miles I can go before I need another one. Wow, so helpful.
3541 2018-12-11 18:18:01 Who work in the oil field?
3542 2018-12-11 18:18:01 Oddly enough MAGA and “nobody tells me what do do” soverign citizenry are like oil and water. I believe several of their ilk have Hispanic wives as well...
3543 2018-12-11 18:17:45 Got my oil changed and I changed an engine mount..  And it's just barely noon. Just let me know when I can stop adulating

3547 2018-12-11 18:17:32 I could see Russia building a military base in oil rich Venezuela and these nuclear capable bombers will be minutes away from the USA mainland.
3548 2018-12-11 18:17:29 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for probiotic vodka, and put some spiced chai essential oil in my diffuser.
3549 2018-12-11 18:17:25 Where is the oil to waste and what product of makeup  could it be
3550 2018-12-11 18:17:25 May not be a solution in the short term but will be in the near future, if oil and coal don't lobby against it and spread lies and pay off politicians to legislate against it.
3551 2018-12-11 18:17:24 Silicon Valley and Seattle are two places in particular that have been hit by it (my city, Edmonton, to an extent has been hit by it via oil boom. But my company still typically has to import talent).

I mean, if we’re squeezing babies for oil, we should skin them, too. Use every part & all that jazz.
3567 2018-12-11 18:15:52 Remember when we were kids and everyone always saying the world was running out of oil...what happen to that?
3568 2018-12-11 18:15:51 He was there watching Oil Kings and took in the NHL contest while there.They failed to mention he was at the junior game.
3569 2018-12-11 18:15:49 At the moment, we have ETFs for markets that are smaller, less organized, with phone trades (!), with minimal and obscure reporting. We also have ETFs for larger markets but which are heavily manipulated all the time, e.g. gold, oil, and most other commodity ETFs.

3572 2018-12-11 18:15:31 Nigerians feel so important that when something happens to them someone comes to their rescue.

Newsflash( UAE has been thinking out of oil for the last 10yrs with the postulation " What happens to UAE with no oil".

3580 2018-12-11 18:14:59 I’m in the Arabian Sea, looking for the message in a bottle. It’s supposed be just to the left of the oil rig, just below the surface of the water. It’s not there. It’s not anywhere. Can’t progress in the game until I locate an item that is not present in my game.

Middle class does have to shoulder a bit of it but we can implement a plan where the wealthy and the polluters shoulder more of it... And if you not a oil guy are an extremely wealthy dude you should agree with me
3585 2018-12-11 18:14:42 OK, I understand why Brian voted leave, I just think it is a stupid reason based on incomplete knowledge and fueled by snake oil salesmen lying about current issues and promising impossible futures.

3607 2018-12-11 18:13:13 I think the point Kenney tries to make, is how it seems like the NDP always seem to clandestinely work with the Feds, yet publicly show a brave pro Oil face. We see through it. Their anti pipeline past will be their doom.

3617 2018-12-11 18:12:27 Clusters. New fed program. $for hi tech research/innovation to Que Ont BC. Maritimes get 'ocean' cluster. The prairies get 'pulse' cluster. Lentils. AB new industry (to share with SK and Man) to replace oil and gas. Doomed to be hewers of wood and drawers of water. No oil and gas
3618 2018-12-11 18:12:27 We can legalize it's exportation. It's the new oil.
3619 2018-12-11 18:12:26 Living in Ontario and having an outside perspective now after moving here from Alberta, it feels like most people here want Alberta oil to get to tidewater despite what Quebec wants. If they profit from the oil then they should allow it to get to the coast.

3622 2018-12-11 18:12:19 I can’t help but wonder why producers at 60 min would want to lie by omission about this. My guess is that Tesla is underming profits of some of their board’s financial interests or revenue stream related to the oil industry. Follow the money!

3627 2018-12-11 18:12:08 Thank god my car died in the Valvoline parking lot rather than on my way to Columbus. Always trust your gut guys I decided last minute to get an oil change and I’m glad I did lol
3628 2018-12-11 18:12:04 My dad checked all this time nothing was wrong until now! He did not check the oil though lol so Ill take that but breaks and battery everything under the hood was fine. I’m just now having problems lol so I’ll get it together

3631 2018-12-11 18:11:41 Nope, pretty sure he believes it.

Like "People-Kind," male construction workers and "phasing out the oil sands," the PM has a habit of saying what he means.
3632 2018-12-11 18:11:40  I can assure you, Corbyn is a standard social democrat - in Europe, this is totally mainstream, as it was here before Blair.

He's not a communist, he's an MP, and given that we aren't 100% reliant on oil exports like Venezuela, I think you can chill out a bit

3635 2018-12-11 18:11:31 寒すぎてちんちん萎えちゃったよ
3636 2018-12-11 18:11:27 Well, maybe you should read recent Schlumberger's presentations. Big oil maybe isn't but small guys absolutely.
3637 2018-12-11 18:11:26 For the croutons I just rip the bread (2nd day is best) into chunks, sprinkle with olive oil and garlic salt and roast till golden, you can add crispy smoked streaky to the mix or hot chicken breast if you want, a very simple but delicious dinner.
Works well for a summer lunch
3638 2018-12-11 18:11:13 
3639 2018-12-11 18:11:11 You can bet that those oil co. employees wanted Beto to be pro-oil, so it is still wrong.
3640 2018-12-11 18:11:06 try water & a little vitamin e oil
3641 2018-12-11 18:11:03 露出？
3642 2018-12-11 18:11:03 I know that, but we could pipe oil all the way to NB and refine it there or load a ship and get a better price for it on the open market. BC isn't the only way to get oil to market out of AB. NB is practically begging for AB oil, and QC won't "allow" it
3643 2018-12-11 18:11:02 Exfoliate once a week to scrub off dead cells that make skin look dull. When skin is freshly exfoliated, lotion and oil are better absorbed.
3644 2018-12-11 18:10:57 If you can avoid it... awesome! If you can’t.... awesome! Veganism is about doing the best you can. It’s not a purity race. The concerns re: palm oil are legitimate but so is classism in this community. We can only tackle one issue at a time.
3645 2018-12-11 18:10:53 That‘s wonderful! Is it an oil painting or mixed media?
3646 2018-12-11 18:10:49 Still curious about the impacts of oil companies' location choice on poor households, but very nice paper and congratulations on its acceptance at JEEA :)
3647 2018-12-11 18:10:46 And where did you get car? Wayment no oil change  you gotta check this stuff up front bff
3648 2018-12-11 18:10:41 
What are friends for
3649 2018-12-11 18:10:31 Should wipe off with oil trust me.
3650 2018-12-11 18:10:23 just a fun life update I work in a fckn gourmet olive oil store in westmount now
3651 2018-12-11 18:10:19 So I'm getting promoted ads from oil shills.
3652 2018-12-11 18:10:07 これはおっぱいじゃなくて油の貯蔵庫だよ。最悪の事態の時はここから、ね。
3653 2018-12-11 18:10:04 I stuck my fingers into a Sega Genesis and they got stuck.. my dad & grandmother had to pour oil on my fingers & Sega to get them out.. the Sega never worked after that.
3654 2018-12-11 18:10:03 Who has tried the 
best cbd oil so far?
3655 2018-12-11 18:10:01 Exactly  I’m calling them after work like y’all got me MESSED up!! I need a new breaks, they never gave me a oil change when I got the car! Yeah playing games that I don’t have time for
3656 2018-12-11 18:10:00 Yes , I always change my own oil! Better to learn it. All I would need is a jack and a drip pan to catch the used oil and I could have it done within 20 mins
3657 2018-12-11 18:09:59 ゆびしゃぶってくたさい……
3658 2018-12-11 18:09:59 She voted to leave because she believes it won't affect her or her profession. The sad fact is that opera singers will be affected like everyone else.  The market for  luxuries like professional singers will be hit not to mention more expensive food, oil, travel etc
3659 2018-12-11 18:09:58 For the oil I’m guessing but naw, it’s the spaghetti in a bucket that’s a no for me.
3660 2018-12-11 18:09:45 Again, he got a new Nafta, Would you like the US military to seize some Mexican oil to get the money?
3661 2018-12-11 18:09:40 I had the same problem. But girl. Pai’s rosehip oil is liquid fucking gold. It’s expensive but welllllll worth it. I would just mix 2-3 drops in my moisturizer
3662 2018-12-11 18:09:38 Or one might complain that the oil producing localities generate massive revenues but only get the same piece of pie as other Albertans - but this doesn't make sense either
3663 2018-12-11 18:09:33 ほしゅう
3664 2018-12-11 18:09:17 Oil already is piped from Alberta to Sarnia, On

3667 2018-12-11 18:09:15 Pence always looks like he's posing for an oil painting.
3668 2018-12-11 18:09:07 We live in a world where the squeaky wheel gets the oil.
3669 2018-12-11 18:09:00 I agree - though to be fair that article actually says Labour promise to support Scottish industry rather than specifically oil and gas. If that is what Labour plan, I am wholly against it.
3670 2018-12-11 18:08:28 Petroleum fucking stinksgas, oil, whatever.
3671 2018-12-11 18:08:26 they better not refuse me today cuz I need oil change & if yes, it’d be a waste of effort going out & ofc my ootd
3672 2018-12-11 18:08:15 nothing like a phone call from ur mom saying she went to go get an oil change but left with a new car 
3673 2018-12-11 18:08:10 That man confessing rn that he murdered his wife and two daughters and dumped the daughters in oil... because he was having an affair... terrifying
3674 2018-12-11 18:08:06 Really?  Do you actually think that the oil won't be produced?  The pipeline only makes it easier to transport.  The products will be transported by rail and trucks until the pipeline is built.  Which is safer to the public?
3675 2018-12-11 18:08:05 "Border wall" as "Border security" is fucking snake oil and @realDonaldTrump is either selling it or has been sold on it.
3676 2018-12-11 18:08:01 Better not had got no cheap ass 20$ oil change either
3677 2018-12-11 18:07:59 It’s the massive amount of peanut oil, also I loathe crispy fries, so 
3678 2018-12-11 18:07:56 EIA cuts oil price forecast for 2018 and '19, ups 2019 U.S. production outlook
3679 2018-12-11 18:07:51 Instead, believe in the power of CBD oil. God created that plant (hemp) to help us!
3680 2018-12-11 18:07:40 Ok. I wonder if their foundation has pm oil. Hope not.
3681 2018-12-11 18:07:40 I just need someone to take my car to get an oil change, shave my legs, wash my hair and take my trash out. Das it
3682 2018-12-11 18:07:24 Oil prices went from $78 to $50 in 6 weeks.
3683 2018-12-11 18:07:23 1)I guess its intellectually easier to let Quebec carry the burden and responsability for the pipeline issues! Legault has said he is pro oil during his campaign! Even if he had given his ok do you think it would have changed something? Really? He is just the « fall guy » ...
3684 2018-12-11 18:07:23 You both should explain to me how the greatest atrocities came from the North? Was there anytime your allocations was denied from the Northern leaders that led the country? Don't you have governors, senators,HOR, state legislators,councilors and chairmen? How is it the North?
3685 2018-12-11 18:07:23 Not-easy-but-almost-certain way to get on the path to becoming a USD millionaire in 2019: Extract CBD oil and export to Canada, US, UK the same routes used to export ogbono and ugu. #Businessidea
3686 2018-12-11 18:07:21 you ever had that shit oven baked after being brushed with olive oil?? 

the people love kale. we love it.
3687 2018-12-11 18:07:12 Only been using aloe vera oil on my face for 3 days n my shit glowy n even n allat.
3688 2018-12-11 18:06:43 No need for any confirmatory data
Oil was confirmed years ago
This is not frontier exploration

They need to strike all three zones for the sentiment to return
3689 2018-12-11 18:06:42 Trump should Shut his mouth !Bush had all the opportunities to redo the boarder after 911 and he chose to go to war instead of protecting our boarders .He wanted and is still in the oil $ .So just stop blaming the DEMS when it was George w Bush that should have done it .2001
3690 2018-12-11 18:06:39 Time once made Hitler and Stalin person of the year, 1938 & 1939, shit you not.
3691 2018-12-11 18:06:37 Canada hasn't spent a dime on twinning the line yet, by the way. EI enhancements, rail cars (available at some point in 2019) won't be mean shit for a province being hammered since 2015. Better yet, let AB leave confederation. AB will be happy and take our dirty oil with us.

3697 2018-12-11 18:06:18 I put lavender essential oil in my diffuser and my office smells lovely

3699 2018-12-11 18:06:09 Jeez, like we haven’t heard this in some form before? “... Carter Paige great guy, George Papadopoulos, oil guy, great guy..”. can’t wait to see who
3700 2018-12-11 18:06:05 Note game playing, Leon; but certainly her Party, Parliament and the country has been played. It the classic long con, make everyone think they have won then come back with a compromise that appears to be different. It’s still snake oil!
3701 2018-12-11 18:05:59 I thought they put baby oil on they hands
3702 2018-12-11 18:05:57 Join us today for the Aromatherapy University 'Essential Oil Safety and Wellness' LIVE with Muskaan at 3 PM PDT - SNAPCHAT!
3703 2018-12-11 18:05:51 Its already bad enough we fry are foods in it but drinking oil as a beverage? You don't think thats a problem
3704 2018-12-11 18:05:41 I can't ever responsibly purchase a gas car again.  I can't.  I won't support the coal and oil industry, and we need to take better care of this planet.
3705 2018-12-11 18:05:39 Just a suggestion from this Englander. Scotland keeps its oil,and profits are spent in Scotland. Just like the Norwegians do with their oil.
3706 2018-12-11 18:05:36 I think that's a modern and even reasonably ecologically responsible way to move away from oil. For now - build the pipelines. I wonder if AF could see himself to that position or if the green goggles are too far tinted for him. I'd bet you're right, personally. Good call.
3707 2018-12-11 18:05:35 What does the soap smell like though? Oil? Anakin’s hopes and dreams?
3708 2018-12-11 18:05:23 CFTC considers bitcoin and other crypto’s commodities. Like corn, wheat, oil, or orange juice. Ripple II subsidiary is no different than Cargill, Exxon, or Tropicana.

3710 2018-12-11 18:05:15 By "strike oil" I mean oil in commercial quantities

R2 produced ~350000barrels already at Tilapia

We could say that some oil will still be there in R's, bit not sure how much left

To me commercial oil strike in Djeno was always the reason to follow #AAOG
3711 2018-12-11 18:05:11 حطيت essential oil اللي بحبه في الdiffuser والقطط عايزين يهربوا من الاوضه وانا بتخنق وعماله اكح 
3712 2018-12-11 18:05:06 Did you know? While most home oil tank systems are used primarily for heating purposes, some systems can be adapted to produce electricity and generate emergency power. To explore these options, give us a call today.
3713 2018-12-11 18:05:06 Use witch hazel and rosehip oil. If you have the $$ get Pai’s rosehip bioregenerate oil. It’s heaven in a bottle.
3714 2018-12-11 18:04:59 Hey girls new discovery on what’s has helped my breakouts and scarring. I add one drop of grapefruit essential oil to my face wash when I was my face. It’s done wonders!
3715 2018-12-11 18:04:56 100 million in arms deal with the Saudis- pipeline, oil and gas deal from Russia....

3716 2018-12-11 18:04:55 Oil on repeat since yesterday! 
3717 2018-12-11 18:04:40 Anointing oil ni mo need
3718 2018-12-11 18:04:34 Unfortunately that’s the attitude of today’s service providers. Sad isn’t it? Years ago I worked in a Texaco Service Station. In addition to pumping gas, as a routine service, we cleaned the windshield, checked the oil, radiator, fan belt at no cost.
3719 2018-12-11 18:04:26 I lost 25 pounds eating potatoes for a month. No butter, no oil, sour cream ect. Just potatoes (any kind I mixed sweet potatoes and golden potatoes) with salt pepper spices and onion.

3721 2018-12-11 18:04:05 Omg argan oil is THEE ONE. When I am no longer bald i'm tryna be like you.
3722 2018-12-11 18:04:03 Did somebody say oil
3723 2018-12-11 18:03:53 I wash my face, apply baby oil/cleansing milk (which I may discontinue, and use only oil) as soon as I get home. Do everything else + dinner and when it's time to go to bed, I have gotten into a routine to re-apply oil and go to bed. Even if I don't do that, it's worked out ok
3724 2018-12-11 18:03:51 Who’s getting their oil changed every 3000 miles?
3725 2018-12-11 18:03:49 The Urjit Patel matter is basically a feud between Mukesh Ambani

3728 2018-12-11 18:03:38 Ottawa gets $5,157 Oil $ from every man woman & child in Alberta while Alberta has 8 Billion Deficit. Que gets 13.1 Billion Welfare from Ottawa & has lowest Daycare & University Tuition in . Que blocks a Pipeline while using killer Saudi Sheik & US train oil (that killed 47)
3729 2018-12-11 18:03:25 Oh yes. SO much in common....... Except my favorite Essential Oil is Bourbon...
3730 2018-12-11 18:03:15 Wake up. Sirota intentionally lumps individual contributions under a scary grouping of "Oil and Gas" donations in order to make it look like Beto took money from Oil and Gas PACs.  This is not what happened but Sirota wants you to think it is in order to sully Beto's name.
3731 2018-12-11 18:03:13  eish...the way my account balance can just giggle.. at this point I'm going back to using Zamanita because olive oil prices ain't it anymore 
3732 2018-12-11 18:03:11 I one day stopped washing my face and my skin got better?? I s2g your skin adjusts back to your body’s natural oil production and stuff

3734 2018-12-11 18:02:37 I need gas for my vehicle to work and natural gas to heat my home. I do use oil based products for living but I try to drive less, keep warm not hot, buy sustainable foods and products. I do shop based on environmental factors and hope that's enough but I fear it isn't.
3735 2018-12-11 18:02:32 @projectreturns hoping for a middle strike on oil reserves frankly
3736 2018-12-11 18:02:26 Bernie's ego makes him all but useless. Can't win as an independent, won't be a Democrat, no 2020 bid. And why can't progressives that work in the oil and gas industry support Beto? Is employment part of the purity test now too?
3737 2018-12-11 18:02:20 Once asked my mom why she had to buy a 10ml bottle of anointing oil for almost 200 from Nigeria instead of just buying virning oil and having her pastor pray for it for free... Lmaoo i was almost homeless that day.
3738 2018-12-11 18:02:11 No, what you have here, is you botched the reporting. If you'll actually do the statistical work rather then engaging in cherry-picking and acting all innocent and pretending you weren't comparing Texas with states with no oil jobs at all, you'd get a different reception.

3741 2018-12-11 18:01:51 Fried chicken. Like, dunked in burning oil, but with no weird flour coverings, just crispy, orange-y charred meat.
3742 2018-12-11 18:01:50 You forgot 1980 when the Reagan Administration reversed most of Carter's environmental protections because his VP was funded by the oil industry.

3744 2018-12-11 18:01:47 Where on Earth did the largest intentional oil spill in recorded history occur? #EAOcean
3745 2018-12-11 18:01:42 I'm a very "pro new world energy sources" and "don't fuck up our environment" guy myself, but being pragmatic, I think the revenue created by our oil in the immediate future could help our economy fund the transition into becoming world leaders in those energy sectors.
3746 2018-12-11 18:01:38 Folks will get a new car & say they don’t wanna put miles on it.. I always wonder why did they even buy a car if they don’t wanna drive it far? As long as you maintain it with the proper oil changes and services, does it matter?
3747 2018-12-11 18:01:35 You’re acting like it’s his money lol. It helps America’s economy and his chances of re-election. He’s not selling US oil and pocketing the cash. Still waiting on valid points.
3748 2018-12-11 18:01:32 I am all for refineries in AB as well. Selling the refined products would make the most sense both here and in the East.

Building Energy East would allow us to get oil to existing refineries in ON, NB and NS to get us off of foreign oil. That is my point, buying our own product
3749 2018-12-11 18:01:24 Kev and Khlo had their stuff together and yet as three black chevron oil engineering students put it: I didn't think and yet the personal statement was due soon and a fully exhaustive report on Christ was due.  Yet on the dais Burt complained that the ladders were slowly being

TLP101V was drilled end of 2006
Production from 2007 from R2

R zones are tested producers

Mengo as well

Djeno as well

What #AAOG need with TLP103C is a bit of luck and strike oil in all three R2, Mengo and Djeno

These names refer to oils that are extracted from the marijuana plant that has high levels of THC, making it illegal in most states. It will also contain CBD and other cannabinoids.

3758 2018-12-11 18:00:41 Sooooo....not the least bit concerned that Andy Boy actually thinks women's rights are a joke,  and therefore doesn't actually care that no gender-based analysis of Saudi oil was done.

Take a seat, you're embarrassing yourself.
3759 2018-12-11 18:00:36 This means if developing country governments want to attract these major oil companies (often more desirable than smaller less experienced companies) then they may want to particularly pay attention to the institutional setting- eg things like constraints on executive power

3776 2018-12-11 17:59:24 Point proven. Trump loves oil and money.
3777 2018-12-11 17:59:21 I'm not going to pretend I'm not for clean energy and renewables.
 I've said before that Oil is a snake that eats it's tail.
 Going to be some lean years but maybe that's the point?
 Idk, I'm also fully aware that a lot of good people were simply providing for there families
3778 2018-12-11 17:59:20 Truth is as old as this world. Truth is like oil and it will always float on the surface however much its mixed. You don't need to worry about false preachers, they will show! Besides, no one really forces people to be a part of their congregation.

3796 2018-12-11 17:58:00 I can believe I’m going to be alive for the next economic collapse. The worst in history.. 2008 we owed 2 trillion we now owe 21 trillion.... look around...Paris..UK..Europe..trump...oil.. prepare accordingly..
3797 2018-12-11 17:57:54 About time someone took notice that (1) Quebec said NO to pipeline and Feds just said "Alright, whatever you wish" (2) New Brunswick wants to refine AB's oil - more jobs, keep profits in CDA (3) PQ gets, probably always has, HANDOUTS. Tired of U PQ.

3800 2018-12-11 17:57:40 Yeah, when the oil goes up again and Albertans get their attitude and swagger back its back to "up yours the rest of Canada"! Well, its hard to feel bad for high schoolers who went to make the big bucks but have no education to fall back on. Go back to school like most of us did.
3801 2018-12-11 17:57:37 If you need something alittle stronger look into RSO.  Rick Simpson Oil. There is info on YT regarding it.
3802 2018-12-11 17:57:32 No se si es bon moment per ser un poc llandós i preguntar que penses del Peak Oil (t'ho he preguntat ja? Esque ho pregunte a molta gent)
3803 2018-12-11 17:57:23 Mine was wheat so I googled what was best & apparently barley holds the heat for longest. I've seen rice, barley, wheat and beans as fillings,i bought a huge bag of rice and some barley to mix in with lavender oil. 
3804 2018-12-11 17:57:03 It blows me away that ppl choose to believe the vast majority of the scientific community is engaged in a #climatechange fraud when it is well documented that oil companies themselves have known they’re causing #GlobalWarming for decades but covered it up to keep profits safe.
3805 2018-12-11 17:57:03  ايه ويقولوا انت حسابات وهمية
3806 2018-12-11 17:57:00 "doesn’t piss u off that you get your oil from a US pipeline?"
The Enbridge pipeline only runs through the USA, it remains owned/supplied by Calgary's Enbridge. So, I'm hardly pissed at all, I'm glad that we carry less risk when the pipeline eventually leaks, as all do. #cdnpoli

3811 2018-12-11 17:56:46 I'm not trying to minimize your concerns but honestly AB has bigger worries than equalization. 

The oil industry isnt forever. Diversification needs to happen ASAP so that you can weather economic downturns without asking for transfers. 

Same for many other provinces.
3812 2018-12-11 17:56:44 Hey I find it great your rejecting serving but do you renounce the useless wars as imperialist? Wars fought for proxy power and oil? Also do you renounce the military industrial complex making money off of this imperialism and sending good ppl to die so a general gets paid?

3828 2018-12-11 17:55:18 I gather the 400k bpd of Libyan oil presently offline is being counted as "spare capacity" as well.

3830 2018-12-11 17:54:43 nope. I got it. I just didn't think it was valid.
3831 2018-12-11 17:54:41 If the process is the same as elsewhere then they'll set a date and tell you to put olive oil/similar in each ear for 10m a day in the run up to the appointment. Used to be for 10 days but the place I went asked for less than that, I think
3832 2018-12-11 17:54:39 Agrarian disaster has tightly grasped India as a whole.All d political parties must know "Old snake oil remedies" won't work. As India z an agricultural country, farmers must be benefitted 4m all angles to make our economy surplus bt no such initiative has been taken yet.

3855 2018-12-11 17:53:36 That's because you only get so much petrol and so much diesel out of a barrel of oil. It's not efficient to try to create one fuel. CCS is a standard and, like phone chargers enforced stadardisation before it, it'll simplify everyone's lives.
3856 2018-12-11 17:53:35 psa: y’all its okay to have oily skin. oil keeps your skin moisturized & oily skin ppl have a youthful skin longer than other skin types bc if you think about it dry skin are prone to getting wrinkly & cracked. so stop trying to dry out your skin! oils are good for you!!

3869 2018-12-11 17:52:36 If we are discussing the US becoming less dependent on oil (I never was before).... Do you think that means just eliminating oil overnight? Who is saying that? It will probably take over 20 years to happen and we will probably never eliminate the need completely...1/

3904 2018-12-11 17:49:14 Nice straw man.... not talking about how the US consumes oil at all. I am talking about corporate profiteering for the elite and politicians of off federally owned land (means of production). It is socialism... but only for the rich, and kept that way through lobbying.

3908 2018-12-11 17:49:05 The American shale industry has gotten so efficient that there is an oversupply of oil.  That's why prices keep going down.  Nobody decides to drop it for the holidays, and no policy specifically causes that.
3909 2018-12-11 17:49:04 Lmao, from what! Oil? that has drastically reduced in price and the only way you didn’t feel the shockwave of that is because us as a whole absorbed the price drop, Scotland on its own would have suffered badly.  so please tell me how Scotland holds us up? X

3914 2018-12-11 17:48:50 Solar is still shit in desert countries. Tell me why UAE is building a massive nuke plant then? Grids in middle eastern oil producing nations are some of the dirtiest on earth. Solar is doing nothing. You don’t have hydro. That leaves nukes.
3915 2018-12-11 17:48:28 Why BTE under so much pressure versus other beaten up oils like CPG, TCW?   I know tax loss selling pressure, but the OIL group is holding up well... unlike BTE
3916 2018-12-11 17:48:08 Lol whoa there play boy haha trust me it gets real when you do official PBA lanes. Different oil patterns and all lol I tried out for UF bowling team when I was there and found out the hard way
3917 2018-12-11 17:48:03 Real pea nut oil hours who up?
3918 2018-12-11 17:47:56 There is a lot more to Canada than Alberta, oil and their non-stop rubber booted cry-babyism. #cdnpoli
3919 2018-12-11 17:47:50 False. Demand comes from the consumer. So do MOST GHGs emitted as a result of that consumption. Oil demand will grow whether you like it or not. Who should supply that demand? Canada or blood oil nations like OPEC?
3920 2018-12-11 17:47:47 When 80% of oil industry will stay unaffected by carbon pricing, not gonna do much unfortunatly.
3921 2018-12-11 17:47:47 Where is the oil money!!!
3922 2018-12-11 17:47:35 What your facts didn’t say was all that oil came from private land because Obama shutdown any new drilling on public lands. So how did he actually help?
3923 2018-12-11 17:47:32 Fue vamos a la oil jaja
3924 2018-12-11 17:47:15 Its a Pity they killed him for the Oil
3925 2018-12-11 17:47:12 The “dewy” makeup look is good in theory but i end up looking like i mixed foundation with coconut oil & that aint it

3927 2018-12-11 17:47:04 fish oil: yep
coconut oil: probably
3928 2018-12-11 17:47:01 “LOTS”? It was like 3% of his donations. Has he ever voted in favor of oil companies or against climate change solutions?
3929 2018-12-11 17:46:49 Conservatives know that Quebec's government has no say in where they get their oil from. Its private business that chooses that. If Conservative premiers and wannabes want to lie then they should take full responsibility for gas prices getting jacked up before every long weekend
3930 2018-12-11 17:46:48 NRA is top donor for republicans that don’t want to vote on gun control, coal and oil companies top donors for republicans that won’t address climate change - breaking news: lobbyists exist
3931 2018-12-11 17:46:44 Yo I need beard oil now. Anyone with a plug?
3932 2018-12-11 17:46:42 None of them have the record bernie has and beto recieved lots of money from the oil and gas industry which disqualifies him in my eyes.
3933 2018-12-11 17:46:38 Q bhai 

Usne mere hath me patanjali oil dekh liya h kya 
3934 2018-12-11 17:46:35 After opening his red oil mouth and say such rubbish then he will expect foreign investors to go to his corrupt country to invest right? Pastor
3935 2018-12-11 17:46:30 Oil change 
Car wash 
New battery 
Finally
3936 2018-12-11 17:46:28 Do I need CBD oil in my life?
3937 2018-12-11 17:46:28 Chicken broth soy sauce seasame oil chives boil then add eggs maybe a little bit of rice. Salt and pepper to taste sip it slowly. It works
3938 2018-12-11 17:46:27 Looking at the schedule, we have a few openings for this week...do you need an alignment? Brakes? Check engine light? Front end work? Tires? Air conditioner work? Oil Change? Tire rotation? We can help! Give us a call! 785-336-2828
3939 2018-12-11 17:46:10 I am literally BEGGING you not to sell me Young Living/ DōTerra/ any other essential oil. For the love of God, please don't.
3940 2018-12-11 17:46:09 yesterday a girl pulled out her essential oil called “panic button” before the final 

me too
3941 2018-12-11 17:46:05 I think it’s about oil too. Gas prices effect poor people the most unfortunately. I agree we should cut all foreign aid. Brian I didn’t realize you were such a @RandPaul fan.
3942 2018-12-11 17:46:03 It's already been reported, by David and others, that oil and gas executives donated heavily to Beto. Trying to pretend it was all gas station employees is completely dishonest when it's already been shown to be untrue. He pledged, he broke it.
3943 2018-12-11 17:46:00 Oil happened.
3944 2018-12-11 17:45:52 those are valid points which you brought up. That said, the rule of law should allow business to thrive. Imagine what happened during the oil embargo when everything was suddenly nationalized. regarding patent extension, it is true that companies may milk their patents but that's
3945 2018-12-11 17:45:49 Don’t they post prices before you get the services??? Where I go, they do, with synthetic oil, it’s around 60-70 dollars, depending on the car
3946 2018-12-11 17:45:46 ขายควยอะไรกันอ่ะ เผือกไม่ทัน
3947 2018-12-11 17:45:14 Oregano oil and coconut oil - mix a few drops on soles of your feet! Antibacterial and antiviral! And Thieves (Young Living essential oil) feel better !!
3948 2018-12-11 17:45:10 Di ko makita yung oil pastel ilang araw ko nang gustong sayangin yun hahahaha
3949 2018-12-11 17:45:02 So that whole ice age was what, exactly? 
Stop taxing citizens to death for this idiotic scheme. This is nothing different than a snake oil salesman or a Ponzi scheme!
3950 2018-12-11 17:45:02 Most other jobs also haven't been lied to for decades about what their real job is.
We're not faulting the folks who join at all. We're faulting the system which fraudulently claims their lives and health for Gold Oil and Drugs.
3951 2018-12-11 17:44:59 If you were both honest & reasonable, you’d have said #BTC is majority controlled by a group of miners in China who can do as they please with the network. Then you’d have said the best digital asset ever created is #XRP and explained it will be the oil of the banking sector.
3952 2018-12-11 17:44:44 Sorry I do't follow French fiscal policy? The DSA is suggesting taxing oil companies, apparently believing that the cost will somehow not be passed to consumers.
3953 2018-12-11 17:44:35 What are the Two prices of Alberta OIL???  I only hear you talk about the Tar Sand Dif... Tar sands is only what 18-20% of your output !!! #JUSTSAYING
3954 2018-12-11 17:44:32 Do y'all cook your eggs with butter or oil?
3955 2018-12-11 17:44:30 That's cause u used to those Muslim oils that all smell the same lol. I got this oil lady down here who has some pure 
3956 2018-12-11 17:44:25 25 oil industry execs contributed to Beto's campaign despite Beto's pledge not to take such money. Reporting this is fair and accurate. The real question is whether it is significant. These contributions represent 25 out of over 52,000 large contributions.
3957 2018-12-11 17:44:24 Yeah I use loads of oil because I’m not sure what they each do individually lol
3958 2018-12-11 17:44:22 I struggle with individuals appearing to champion carbon emissions impact on climate change and then celebrating the wedding of the daughter of India's wealthiest Oil and Gas tycoon? Elitist Hypocrisy
3959 2018-12-11 17:44:19 CBD oil has changed my life
3960 2018-12-11 17:44:19 คนมันต่ำ ยังไงมันก้คิดได้แค่นั้นแหละ เหน่ยย
3961 2018-12-11 17:44:13 Yet HE WON. That’s all you need to know. So that snake oil salesman Schumer can go to hell, which, based on his support of killing unborn babies, that’s exactly where he’s going.
3962 2018-12-11 17:44:11 I need to do a hair vlog watseba? #2019goals... I love NappyFu on YouTube. Kimmaytube’s moisturizer has been a mainstay of mine for years (add a little aloe & a little castor oil plus your other fave oils to your hair cream). I’m learning a lot from Curly Proverbz about Ayurveda
3963 2018-12-11 17:44:09 Decent day with #OIL stocks bouncing. PF ^2.1%

Punt on #ECHO last week not looking great, off -13%. Still hold. 

Another positive, as somebody who hates the dark evenings, at last they have stopped drawing in. Saturday they start moving back out! Happy days. 
3964 2018-12-11 17:44:09 Cool experiences. I've heard there are all kinds of exotic cars on the roads there. I guess that oil money is flowing!
3965 2018-12-11 17:44:02 How about I give you a hot oil massage. I'll be your remedy got mama.
3966 2018-12-11 17:44:01 If the oil companies think something is a good idea, it's probably a good idea. You know, just not for you.
3967 2018-12-11 17:43:48 Bernie is more relevant than ever. Can we really expect Beto to lead us away from the fossile fuel industry that Climate Change demands of us? Beto is supported by oil/gas, for off-shore drilling, in TX, I am afraid not. #GreenNewDeal is paramount for our future. #Bernie2020
3968 2018-12-11 17:43:45 Baq in da city. Seent errbody for like a quick min upstate and Sunday. Also #Onika got an oil change and her sensor replaced, but not widdout drama of course lol

3970 2018-12-11 17:43:42 Oyaaa...open una Bluetooth or infrared
3971 2018-12-11 17:43:36 Warm places require air conditioning. Its a wash. Hydro is not expensive in a few provinces like where Aurora is based. Alberta is oil country and has the most sun in Canada plus their greenhouse is fully automated 8th wonder of the world. Efficient and edgy.
3972 2018-12-11 17:43:34 Black castor oil..or aloe Vera
3973 2018-12-11 17:43:28 Really good hemp seed oil hand lotion and bamboo gloves.
3974 2018-12-11 17:43:28 Nice view of the sun shining through the morning fog in AB. In 2018 RiggerTalk has been in TX, AZ, AB, SK, BC, WY, MO, ID, UT, NV, AZ, ND, OK and always impressed with nature’s unexpected stunning scenery!

#GetPinned #RiggerTalk #WorldServices #OilFieldServices #ServicesMap
3975 2018-12-11 17:43:15 The point is if they maintained a sales tax when times are good there'd be money in the "bank" when oil inevitably goes down.
This isn't the first bust cycle of oil prices and yet AB/Canada continually fail to prepare. Norway has a huge fund. AB/Canada could have, too.
3976 2018-12-11 17:43:12 For soft silky hair, massage strands with coconut oil 2-3 times a week!
3977 2018-12-11 17:43:05 While your at it ticket all the Quebec plates in Alberta. They seem to like oil and gas when it's required to drive to our province.

3981 2018-12-11 17:42:50 So i am Free not to want it  But you tax me if i don’t take it .
3982 2018-12-11 17:42:41 @POTUS but he’s a deal guy. That’s what he does. “I make great deals”. GOP has been duped by a snake oil failed salesman
3983 2018-12-11 17:42:40 Oh most definitely - my husband knows more off the top of his head about the components in CBD oil, but I understand that it is very different from hemp oil. Definitely a viable option to try here in Canada!
3984 2018-12-11 17:42:38 I use essential oils. Thieves oil & Frankincense oil. Movie to watch ~ Love Actually. Feel better soon.
3985 2018-12-11 17:42:29 Didnt silver oil gold and a lot of other stuff popped with an even wider impact? @peter
3986 2018-12-11 17:42:22 Where was "resistance" corporate media when #obama was crushing indigenous people fighting to secure their #water from #oil companies (spills)?
3987 2018-12-11 17:42:17 Oil, it’s 1pm.
3988 2018-12-11 17:42:11 It's made out of flour, yeast, sugar, salt, and water and oil for frying. Keep in mind though that it isn't just limited to that. I know some people who add cinnamon or chocolate to it. Tbh it has a lot of names depending on which West African country you go to besides Cameroon
3989 2018-12-11 17:42:10 If you never change your oil, you won't have to worry about these kinds of things.
3990 2018-12-11 17:42:03 The oil of the pea nut is lindy, too me
3991 2018-12-11 17:42:03 Weren't you doing the cannabis oil or something like that? It didn't help?
3992 2018-12-11 17:41:51 Sometimes the right mix of oil and cologne will smell better than that super expensive cologne. That is when you using oil other than Egyptian Musk. Gotta be more versatile than that 
3993 2018-12-11 17:41:51 Sir, even on economy side , they managed $100 oil and growth very well..if oil goes to $100 with this government..jaitley and modi shit in their pants for sure !!
3994 2018-12-11 17:41:48 Rep. Chatfield (R) - whose district includes the oil pipeline - speaking in favor of bill. Says it's not an R or D issue. He says pipeline was built because it's safest mode of transportation - safer than trail, track, barge #mileg #LameDuck
3995 2018-12-11 17:41:40 Same link. But to your point, I've been seeing how dissatisfied #NJDevils fans are about Hall. Maybe that trade worked out for the Oil after all...
3996 2018-12-11 17:41:39 Tx for confirming what most of us already suspected. The Liberal's flawed policies on climate change tax, oil, immigration, treatment of vets & military, indigenous affairs, gun control and spending are all contributors to their downfall and the rise of the PC's.
3997 2018-12-11 17:41:35 Wtf phil
3998 2018-12-11 17:41:34 Jeeze, Wildrose party followers sure having a normal reaction today...

Just kidding, they sure seem to love airing their bigotry in public by bashing French canadians (including non Quebecers) because one politician said they weren't interested in Alberta sand oil.
3999 2018-12-11 17:41:32 Hopefully someone will point out the difference between oilfield workers contributing money, and oil executives contributing money. Especially in TX, where the oil industry makes up so much of the workforce. But I’m not hopeful, since this seems to be the anti-Beto talking point
4000 2018-12-11 17:41:28 NNPC which President Buhari heads as oil Minister has NOT remitted to the CBN since mid-2016! 

President Buhari cannot FIGHT CORRUPTION!

President Buhari is CORRUPTION
4001 2018-12-11 17:41:25 #Individual1, you want a #BorderWall so badly. Then build your lousy wall between #ND and #Canada. I'm sure the ND farmers and oil companies will write the checks. No problem. 
#BlueWave #Schumer #Trump #budget
4002 2018-12-11 17:41:22 That’s a hell of a price. You probably couldn’t by the oil for that price.
4003 2018-12-11 17:41:18 And so they should....the DIRTY OIL comes from Saudi...MURDEROUS SAUDI's who have CALLED OUT CANADA for standing up for human rights. But Quebec is fine with importing their DIRTY energy...from the hands of MURDERERS!!
4004 2018-12-11 17:41:18 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
4005 2018-12-11 17:41:11 You can also get olbas oil to use in the bath like a soak for when you especially feel dead
4006 2018-12-11 17:41:09 @Bease11 hoping to get your autograph Sunday at Lucas oil!!!  GO COWBOYS!!!
4007 2018-12-11 17:41:03 I have this feeling oil will be discovered soon in South Africa. We should be land-owners when that happens.
4008 2018-12-11 17:40:54 Lord, your children do not know what they are doing  
This is not how we cook with weed, friends! 
PLEASE come right and make the canna-butter/oil for your canna-fectionary needs 
4009 2018-12-11 17:40:53 for her but not trump?
4010 2018-12-11 17:40:47 Where do u get your facts from?Oil consumption is up year over year especially in area’s producing green energy production.
4011 2018-12-11 17:40:44 Palm oil needs to be banned from our food/products. It's the leading cause of deforestation of the Amazon, the lungs of our planet. Coconut oil & cocoa butter, both renewable & sustainable, are both sufficient substitutes. This needs to be something the world starts demanding NOW

4022 2018-12-11 17:40:02 had a lot of respect for a dude until he told me he paid 300 for an eighth of oil from Colorado. Sorry dude I’m sure the quality is great but you got the life CUSTY’d out of you no I dont want a gram for $100 foh
4023 2018-12-11 17:39:58 You guys burn oil for electricity. Fail.
4024 2018-12-11 17:39:57 Many people pray for cake but when the creator gives them flour, oil, eggs, sugar, a pan, & an oven they get frustrated & leave the kitchen.
4025 2018-12-11 17:39:53 なら最初から自分で描いてくれってやつですねwww
4026 2018-12-11 17:39:48 Oil change and new tires 
4027 2018-12-11 17:39:41 So you are writing to Trudeau and telling him that as a women you cannot accept that we continue to allow Saudi oil into Canada given how they treat us over there? I have written my representative, Trudeau and Scheer time to pressure them!
4028 2018-12-11 17:39:36 Saint Bush killing millions of people in a fake oil war was absolutely not traitorous
4029 2018-12-11 17:39:35 U pakai oil cleansing apa eh?
4030 2018-12-11 17:39:31 I put a oil in my lips with no carrier oil and let’s just say my bottom lip is burnt , literally burnt. Shit burns so bad 
4031 2018-12-11 17:39:24 Ppl stay asking me what I put in my daughters hair... I only put olive oil, water and leave in conditioner in it. Maybe a lil bit of eco gel here and there. But that’s it! My baby just got good ass hair 
4032 2018-12-11 17:39:15 We are utterly in no need of Saudi oil.  Canada supplies most of ours, along with Mexico.
4033 2018-12-11 17:39:12 Prolific writer needed to write about how I spent today . It will sell like olive oil at Shiloh
4034 2018-12-11 17:39:12 And don't forget the oil industry exemption on carbon tax.
4035 2018-12-11 17:39:11 Would you consider boycotting Quebec products - after that province's premier refused to support reviving the Energy East pipeline, dubbing Alberta oil 'dirty energy'? #yeg #yyc
4036 2018-12-11 17:39:06 As an MBA, we expect a higher standard of intellectual analysis. At the core of the current crisis is the international price of oil. It's economic not political. The equalization formula is a federally agreed rigid policy that will involve nation- wide political renegotiation.
4037 2018-12-11 17:39:02 Chill out, Michael. It's a win for the cannabis industry because CBD oil is still a major part of sales and where does it come from? HEMP. CBD is still a schedule 1 drug and this would change its status.
4038 2018-12-11 17:38:57 stop telling that lie! WE DON’T NEED THEM OR THEIR OIL! send them back to 10th century where they belong. No room on this planet for anyone who would kill & dismember another person. @realDonaldTrump & crown prince (you too). need to be locked up. away with the planet poisoners
4039 2018-12-11 17:38:45 Hopefully you find the issue, at the very least fill up on oil, then get some extras to keep in the car. And check periodically to see how much you are roughly losing until it can get fixed.
4040 2018-12-11 17:38:42 $MCEP Oil = Pain
4041 2018-12-11 17:38:15 After a lifetime  of gaining votes from the anti Canadian oil crowd. Nice try.
4042 2018-12-11 17:38:13 Correct. But bunker fuel powered ships have no issue running on crude oil. Which puts a limit on how expensive the fuel can get; when no one needs petrol, diesel, kerosene, and the polymer industry has switched over to synthetic sources, they'll just burn crude.
4043 2018-12-11 17:37:59 It's 179k but due to proximity to prez you could earn bonuses from Saudi Arabia, Russia, Big Oil/Coal, NRA, and other orgs. Downside: you may have some offsetting legal fees.
4044 2018-12-11 17:37:34 Sage advice Ken !!
4045 2018-12-11 17:37:33 Try taking black cohosh, evening primrose oil and CBD oil. They all work wonders on the symptoms of PMS.

4048 2018-12-11 17:37:11 The U.S has done this for pipelines. Taking land from Americans so that a CANADIAN oil company could build pipelines. There’s no way this isn’t illegal but it’s part of the plan to build #KeystoneXL south.
4049 2018-12-11 17:37:11 The Home Office,
The Treasury,
HMICFRS
Newly elected PCCs
Newly promoted CCs
People touring the new snake oil....
4050 2018-12-11 17:37:09 I have been putting tea tree oil on my hair for like a month and using tea tree oil conditioner and it’s really doin something to my hair you guys 
4051 2018-12-11 17:37:09 It would only be a recipient if its (non-resource) tax capacity dipped below the national average. That may happen one day, when the oil economy finally packs it in, but for now, the key point is it could solve its own deficit issue, if problem it is, by increasing its own taxes.
4052 2018-12-11 17:37:02 .@CThompsonAFPM touting tired and predictable #Oil talking points @HouseCommerce Hearing, denying the viability of the #RFS in an effort to undermine farmers across America and consumers at the pump in the interest of his own agenda and Trump's @EPA.
4053 2018-12-11 17:37:01 Now I just need a oil change and new brakes & im in the game
4054 2018-12-11 17:36:59 No pipeline then we dont let their commercial vehicles cross our borders or planes fly in our airspace. We also dont sell our oil to them. Pretty sure the Americans would be happy to make pipeline deals.
4055 2018-12-11 17:36:58 I can comment. what do u gain? r u in oil bussines?
4056 2018-12-11 17:36:56 The point is that the U.S. doesn't really need Saudi Arabia for their oil, so why is Trump giving them a pass on murder when everybody else is trying to rein in a dictator in the making?  Trump really has managed to get people hating their allies & loving despots, hasn't he?
4057 2018-12-11 17:36:56 Judging them is the most satisfying thing istg.. Like why is she putting so much salt or oil and getting angry for them not to cook on time
4058 2018-12-11 17:36:46 Yes exactly but it is still contributed by you and me and is still distributed mainly to Quebec. The same Quebec resisting Western oil and the extra revenue that goes with it, the same Quebec that dumps millions of gallons of raw sewage in the st Laurence. Hypocrisy at its finest
4059 2018-12-11 17:36:39 Pelosi and transparency are like oil and water!  #Trump #Pelosi . Dignified?  Is that when you name call and vilify women because we don’t agree with you?  Pelosi is insulting! @OutnumberedFNC
4060 2018-12-11 17:36:39 My snake oil always comes with a disclaimer. Lol. 
4061 2018-12-11 17:36:35 To answer your question in the ep, Three Kings had an oil torture scene in 1999
4062 2018-12-11 17:36:34 A rare piece of good news from Indonesia, a country which has conspired in the clearance of its rainforests for #palmoil and lobbied the UK govt to intervene in Iceland's decision to eliminate palm oil from its own brands.
4063 2018-12-11 17:36:29 Funny. Wind turbines are made 100% from fossil fuels. Guess employment will increase for oil companies.
4064 2018-12-11 17:36:12 They should be talking about decrease now, crude oil prizes has since gone down 
4065 2018-12-11 17:36:09 @francoislegault you won't accept the "Dirty Oil" from Alberta, does that mean you're going to give back the Billions of $ of "Dirty Oil Money" to Alberta? #cdnpoli @AndrewScheer @jkenney
4066 2018-12-11 17:36:05 Some people are immune to the truth. It’s not a game of winning or losing. The truth is the same for a bodega employee in Harlem as it is for a counterfeit snake oil salesman in Manhattan.
4067 2018-12-11 17:36:02 @LagosTalks913 weird fact in Nigeria, friend kpof kpof, dun dun, shawa and all manner of fried things around ebute ero market in this oringole season is fried with gutter groundnut oil. Na so we see am o
4068 2018-12-11 17:36:01 well...you know what,,,,you haven't ever met or spoken to Tidswell...
I bet you would change your mind if you did.
And ...didn't Tidswell find the oil at Horse Hill ! Hold that fact....and drilled Horse Hill and Brockham successfully? Correct me if I am wrong.
4069 2018-12-11 17:35:56 Honestly I use exactly 6 products which is a lot but my scalp gets build up so i use a cleanser once a month then a regular shampoo once a month. I cowash every few weeks, if i do twist outs i have a product for that, then it's just oil and a leave in conditioner.
4070 2018-12-11 17:35:52 peak oil will literally save us
4071 2018-12-11 17:35:51 I work and have worked all over the world in the offshore oil and gas and construction industry. I need a work visa. Govts give me one where required what is the problem...
4072 2018-12-11 17:35:51 Lol. Starting today I’m gonna dab a little rose oil under my pits to see if that helps.
4073 2018-12-11 17:35:41 I can't wait for Scotland to tell you lot a very similar set of points. With the addition of oil, whisky, water, power and our nukes.
You want them, you'll pay for them. 
4074 2018-12-11 17:35:41 Oil Change then some Crab  soup 
4075 2018-12-11 17:35:36 Why are we buying their oil
4076 2018-12-11 17:35:31 using that oil ASAP
4077 2018-12-11 17:35:24 Seriously, so I've always loved black pepper. When I eat fries I usually have a little ketchup--just enough to hold all the black pepper on my fries. And lately I've been applying the oil from black pepper. It's an instant boost of energy!
4078 2018-12-11 17:35:24 Give me oil in my lamp keep me burnnninnggggg
Give me oil in my lamp I prayyyy 
Give me oil in my lamp keep me burnnninnggggg 
Keep me burning till the break of dayyyyy
4079 2018-12-11 17:35:17 Sadly our "carbon tax" initiative did not pass either.. BIG OIL spent a FORTUNE scaring people... and it worked.
4080 2018-12-11 17:35:10 WTI oil at $51.71/barrel, +$0.72.
4081 2018-12-11 17:35:09 There has been a consistent pattern of double tops while positioning is falling in asset classes. First was copper, then came oil and the dollar is now showing the same thing. #dxy
4082 2018-12-11 17:34:54 Go ahead
4083 2018-12-11 17:34:39 wait.. site at 4:30am? Wow. Construction or oil?
4084 2018-12-11 17:34:37 What is the U.S. doing in Yemen and why? People suffering beyond belief because a local war the U.S. has no business to participate in. Or, as Trump once said: The U.S. cannot be a world police. Oh, I forgot. Saudi Arabia has oil and buys stuff from the U.S. Absolute hypocracy!
4085 2018-12-11 17:34:37 subsidize farmers through restaurants not the military growing poppy seeds for opioids or oil collecting.  use magnets for engines
4086 2018-12-11 17:34:36 Pence: "Oil Can."
4087 2018-12-11 17:34:27 Rep. Rabhi (D) speaking against Great Lakes oil pipeline legislation - 'This is just helping a foreign company ship their foreign oil through Michigan.' #mileg #LameDuck

4089 2018-12-11 17:34:16 Green tea >>>>> , spray it on your face then rub tea tree oil after . Your face will feel hydrated and moist
4090 2018-12-11 17:34:14 I'm looking forward to the election too!  And I hear those same things at the doors in NW - economy, jobs, education and healthcare.  And also the importance of the oil and gas sector and getting pipelines built.
4091 2018-12-11 17:34:12 I give Kashoggi credit for the 30% drop in oil price.
Thanks Khashoggi!
4092 2018-12-11 17:34:10 If I understand correctly bunker fuel is the leftover stuff that no one else wants to burn right? If other EVs really did reduce production of oil might this not descrease bunker fuel volume and increase price, thereby improving case for a shipping fuel switch?
4093 2018-12-11 17:34:09 "First named oleomargarine from Latin for oleum (olive oil) and Greek for margarite (pearl indicating luster), it was later named margarine."
Wikipedia to the rescue!
4094 2018-12-11 17:33:53 Went out with M while she was getting the oil changed in her car and we had a pretty good breakfast.
4095 2018-12-11 17:33:41 Why hasn't the  #US swooped in to support the  spread democracy and freedom in #France?  Is it because they haven't got any oil?
4096 2018-12-11 17:33:34 I am requesting you please give the advt. for geophysicist in Gsi, ONGC, OIL, IOCL  . i am waitng for 4 years otherwise ready for next defeat 2019 lokshaba
4097 2018-12-11 17:33:31 I love palm oil so much. Often times I go to the kitchen and sniff it
4098 2018-12-11 17:33:26 Of course they are. Marlboro “Let’s add the chemicals we use in our cigarettes to cbd oil and make Billions $$”
4099 2018-12-11 17:33:20 Really? With all these remittances, from customs, waec, neco, NNPC, EFCC, firs, oil sales, frsc, and many more, you guys still go borrowing. 

Does that make sense.
4100 2018-12-11 17:33:20 They don’t have a clue how much their lives would be impacted over an oil shortage. People have lost ability to think logically.
4101 2018-12-11 17:33:20 + u did not even respond to other part where i said he voted pro oil and against pro climate. I guess u agree then 
4102 2018-12-11 17:33:18 They reject pipelines due to environment, which is actually an argument for pipelines. More pipelines = less trucks and trains and boats from the Middle East transporting oil, and less reliance on dirty Saudi oil. Unless they’re willing to stop using oil this argument is invalid.
4103 2018-12-11 17:33:07 ALERT:  Trump and the oil companies don’t care.
4104 2018-12-11 17:33:07 The government doesn't buy oil, companies do
4105 2018-12-11 17:33:03 자야지ㅠㅠ
4106 2018-12-11 17:32:49 @SecretaryPerry sir you are the perfect person (as a Texan) to advise the Iraqis and Kurds on best ways to improve energy and oil industry and policy. Thank you for serving America and helping our allies! They desperately need our help!
4107 2018-12-11 17:32:45 Great, so as peak oil continues and oil becomes scarce we'll be sure to run out early. Smart and forward thinking.
4108 2018-12-11 17:32:37 The government doesn't buy oil, companies do.
4109 2018-12-11 17:32:29 Because thanks to fracking, we are now a leading exporter of oil, not to mention our own continued energy dependence on it.
4110 2018-12-11 17:32:19 Thank you Pam for this it is a crime right now that we are sending on oil alone Billions of dollars for 25 yrs or more Que will get 1.5 bill  in transfer payment we will get 0 .We are helping to pay that to Quebec.The Atlantic Accord should be included as a NL plan with Transfers

4113 2018-12-11 17:31:44 Like kerosene oil???
4114 2018-12-11 17:31:42 But sadly use palm oil 
4115 2018-12-11 17:31:36 May Allah forgive him and grant him jannatul firdaus as a final abode.
4116 2018-12-11 17:31:26 Lmao Yeah...somebody tried to get me to wear a Dallas Jersey on a potential bet. I said "I'll USE a Dallas Jersey to  wipe the tires down and check my oil. That about it"
4117 2018-12-11 17:31:14 今日、備品の補充しようと思ってクリップの入ってる引き出し開けたら「機械油　Machine Oil」って書いてあって「や、やだもうこんなところに置くなんて///」って素で照れたけど何で照れたんですかね
4118 2018-12-11 17:31:02 @cliffnationwide petrojams unaccountable oil losses decline from 115+ thousand barrels to just under 50K in fy 2015/16
4119 2018-12-11 17:31:01 luckily for you, the oil price has tanked over the last 2 months!! #pardonthepun
4120 2018-12-11 17:31:00 Right and my car takes synthetic oil 
4121 2018-12-11 17:30:54 Biore cleansing oil
4122 2018-12-11 17:30:44 $bte has lost 17% (and counting) since Friday morning. Since that time, WCS differentials have narrowed and oil prices have remained fairly stable. 

What gives?
4123 2018-12-11 17:30:42 Maybe we should create a different tax rate just for Albertans since the 4.5 billion on a pipeline, billions more to twin it, twice enhancing ei payments, buying rail cars and receiving more revenue from federal transfers than from your oil and gas sector isn't enough.
4124 2018-12-11 17:30:40 Oil stocks remain weak and in a bear trend. They probably struggle until China and the U.S. strike a trade deal

4129 2018-12-11 17:30:18 ...Why do Americans defend Trump for blatantly helping our arch rival instead of us? Trump only cares about oil drilling and money....

4133 2018-12-11 17:29:51 Would be interesting to know how much AB oil is being shipped by rail into Montana, considering the WTI/WCS price differential.
4134 2018-12-11 17:29:50 In the six years I've owned my car, three or four people have touched the hood latch - mechanics and me. How long does DNA stay on it throughout rain, snow, accumulation and erosion of whatever dirt, oil, and oxidation? I have no idea, and I doubt anyone else here knows.
4135 2018-12-11 17:29:48 what difference does that make? this is the same excuse republicans use. 
do you deny that taking this much money from people in oil and gas has an effect on policy or actions?

4143 2018-12-11 17:29:02 I never knew there would be such a profound philosophy in snacks drenched in oil and preservatives. How funny.
4144 2018-12-11 17:28:53 LOL @ gas and oil industry-bought politicians help the downtrodden
4145 2018-12-11 17:28:45 Let’s alll hope Saudi Arabia keeps killing journalist so they lower oil prices to stay on our good side..
4146 2018-12-11 17:28:41 Of course then we all die. . . but oil barons will die rich.
4147 2018-12-11 17:28:40 Me: *get a little money in my pockets* I’m bout to go get that new....

4149 2018-12-11 17:28:33 This isn’t a Trump victory? US oil production is not at the beck and call of a President
4150 2018-12-11 17:28:30 You need to direct your anger at this issue to the oil companies - Esso, Shell, Petro-Can, etc.  The government, regardless of who's in power, do not buy oil.
4151 2018-12-11 17:28:10 That carrot oil is the best shit out.
4152 2018-12-11 17:28:00 @realDonaldTrump the bbl of oil needs to stay in the $60 to $70 range Mr. President...  West Texas oilfield
4153 2018-12-11 17:27:53 @Franklin_Graham is a snake oil salesman, trying to dupe people into sending him their hard earned money.
4154 2018-12-11 17:27:44 Trump and his followers have their own science. They think climate scientists who say the earth is warming are on someone's payroll, like Soros, without proof. Real scientific evidence is not required to back up what they say and do. They'll quote "scientists" hired by Big Oil.
4155 2018-12-11 17:27:41 Two big benefits from lower oil prices:

1) low oil leads to less #inflation, giving the #Fed cover to hike fewer times in 2019.

2) consumers pay less for fuel and have more discretionary spending for holiday purchases.

4158 2018-12-11 17:27:35 We will work with renewed vigor and burn those midnight's oil to ensure we reverse the fortune.

4162 2018-12-11 17:27:19 Going through possible amendments right now on the Straits tunnel plan to build a multi-use tunnel to house a pipeline to send oil and natural gas liquid under the bedrock of the Straits of Mackinac. #mileg #LameDuck

When you are not ready to do anything in the first place why you even ask?
Dumb head.
4165 2018-12-11 17:27:17 Do you have same attitude when banks are bailed out? When Big Oil is subsidized? If debt is your issue, why do you only get mad at student debt? The military is big contributor and Republican tax cuts are bigger contributor. You mad at them?
4166 2018-12-11 17:27:07 iPhone Xs be coated in olive oil when u take the case off
4167 2018-12-11 17:27:05 1. Canada didn't sell Saudi arms, General Dynamics sold them LAV's
2. Canada does not buy oil, Esso, Shell, Petro Canada, etc do.
4168 2018-12-11 17:27:02 Oh I can recommend a thing or two too. Check out @HairyBabyTees or buy a stunning oil painting from @SidelineArt 
4169 2018-12-11 17:26:53 For the earache--heat some oilce oil and drip it into your ear with some cotton! You caould also get some Anauran--antibiotic drops--but I think they're only in Italy--Google them.

4171 2018-12-11 17:26:32 Of course they want to tamp it down. Oil money rules so this 12 year doomsday report is bad for profits. They put money above human lives. @realDonaldTrump

Want to see Wyoming history? Midwest has a very well kept grass field with an oil pump (Horse head) in the end zone. Tracks seen a few winters, but it’s filled with tradition. That’s why its #5.
4175 2018-12-11 17:26:04 Well then just throw out the last 100 years of tax policy. Bet you big buds at big oil have a different thought about big subsidies.
4176 2018-12-11 17:26:02 the guys at the oil change place know me by first name like whats good liandra how are you, like um why everyone know me cause my brother
4177 2018-12-11 17:26:01 .@HouseCommerce hearing: @daveloebsack highlights that 1. #biofuels have decreased our reliance on foreign oil, protecting our natl security 2. #RFS has created thousands of jobs & established a market for our farmers, who are struggling due to @realDonaldTrump's trade war.

4180 2018-12-11 17:25:36 let me get up so i can get a oil change
4181 2018-12-11 17:25:33 No need to go that far, you just need to stop using palm oil in your products. Simple solution. 
4182 2018-12-11 17:25:26 Thing is, (and this is in no way a defense for weak meds) many people were getting relief!  And so that fact just shows me how few cannabinoids, the ECS requires sometimes.  I know a woman who cut oxy 80 w/ CBD only oil in 3 months.

Every city needs a testing facility.
4183 2018-12-11 17:25:22 3 hour wait for an oil change and I can’t put it off.. I’ll use this time for my solo . Why not
4184 2018-12-11 17:25:20 Well...you know what...I put my trust in Tidswell and really hope it comes good like the rest of The Weald.
4185 2018-12-11 17:25:04 I’m mad as hell I come specifically for a oil change not no damn tire Pmo

I sell sapphire scents bespoke perfume oil, diffuser, beard oil.. All at a friendly price. My DM is open for business
4187 2018-12-11 17:25:01 ppl always ask me to do skincare routines and honestly it’s just God + genetics man.....

....then black soap + rosehip oil (pure) + hyaluronic acid (what naturally helps keep skin moisturized/rejuv) + DMAE (naturally firms, strengthens skin) + natural cocoa butter.
4188 2018-12-11 17:25:01 I gotta get my oil changed today like a responsible car owner after just replacing 3 tires 
4189 2018-12-11 17:24:58 Algorithms! Something we will see more of with antitrust! Alphabet is more dangerous than Standard Oil or Bell Systems ever was.
4190 2018-12-11 17:24:48 Peak oil is coming After that demand will decline Our oil is more expensive to produce & harder to get to market Our oil industry will be (is) the 1st to falter
So long as we connect oil with AB pride we'll never have the political will to prepare for tomorrow - in my AB too
4191 2018-12-11 17:24:41 By writers I’m sure they only mean ones that write what they like to hear and vomit on everyone
4192 2018-12-11 17:24:41 I almost just ruined my entire engine bc my oil light never came on  thankfully I pulled over really quick to check it out bc I heard a weird grinding noise. Shit was bone dry smh
4193 2018-12-11 17:24:35 Amidst a global oil supply glut and AB's difficulties with production exceeding takeaway capacity, some in AB with a hate-on for equalization think QC should drill, baby, drill, thence to "fix" equalization but kill a market for AB oil and gas. That would work. #cdnpoli #abpoli
4194 2018-12-11 17:24:16 Too easy 
4195 2018-12-11 17:23:44 It's only Ugandans who buy Anoiting oil for protection from pastors who have military police protection
4196 2018-12-11 17:23:35 THE nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 1.81% Year-on-Year (YoY) in real terms in the third quarter, 2018 (Q3’18), driven by growth in the non-oil sector as the oil sector contracted by 2.8% YoY. I hope Atiku knows that PMB Diversification policy is yielding fruits
4197 2018-12-11 17:23:26 I’m tired of your crap, man. I want to like you but selling expensive cars to rich people while using fossil grids is not helping the climate issue at all. Solar is inconsequential, nuclear and hydro make grids clean. As far as I am concerned, you sell snake oil.

4201 2018-12-11 17:23:11 How did I come home so drunk and still manage to do a hot oil treatment and a hair mask and watch my show on Netflix and put oil on my lashes to grow and wash my face , go Leanna !
4202 2018-12-11 17:22:57 提督(案)解決
4203 2018-12-11 17:22:55 Common denominator: OIL
4204 2018-12-11 17:22:50 Bless, noT to mention palm oil has the biggest yield of any plant oil !!
4205 2018-12-11 17:22:47 Paul from the looks of the markets and what has happened with oil in the past 2 months. Time to be cautious on the bullish side of anything.
4206 2018-12-11 17:22:47 Thank You Mr. President!!!
My car seems to run better on that American Produced U.S. Oil, and other Petroleum  products!!
4207 2018-12-11 17:22:45 I went and got more Jamaican black castor oil and raw shea butter this morning  my products I ordered are taking forever
4208 2018-12-11 17:22:35 And this is why you don't just #VoteRed. The GOP is as corrupt as the Democrats. If you want change then you have to change your vote. Quit falling for the loud mouthed snake oil salesmen and start listening to those that ACTUALLY have America in their best interest

4210 2018-12-11 17:22:29 @RosLehtinen when are you going to do something with Evo morales. Usa has been in middle east only for oil? We (Bolivia) don't have anything USA needs
4211 2018-12-11 17:22:27 how can I remove oil stains that have already set it?
4212 2018-12-11 17:22:25 Eastern Canada, are you seriously ignorant to the fact that with oil trouble, no pipeline action and a ridiculous carbon tax, the west is truly struggling? Or is it just that one  moron and his groupies that don't care? I have to believe that Eastern Canadians aren't this stupid.
4213 2018-12-11 17:22:23 Ah the Dancing Horse :)
4214 2018-12-11 17:22:19 I’ll never get why people spend over $100 to change their oil when they could watch a 15 min YouTube video and learn how to do it for $30
4215 2018-12-11 17:22:19 Don't vore me I taste like motor oil and sadness.
4216 2018-12-11 17:22:16 Only my oil changes because it’s still under warranty. Anything else, I go to my regular mechanic. I’ve had too many issues in the past with certain places 
4217 2018-12-11 17:22:15 Swear allegiance to daffy duck for all i care, you went where you were told as decided by the government.
In your case, most likely you served blair and bush....for oil.
4218 2018-12-11 17:22:10 Hi Kaustubh, it was an order flow area. I dont know what is happening with oil or even what has happened cyclically besides what you have pointed out. Im sorry I missed your comment. Perhaps its best to not trade. I do see that the news suggests recovery.
4219 2018-12-11 17:22:06 Listening to this meeting with trump, pelosi, and Schumer and Schumer makes the comment of “if he was bragging that he won North Dakota and Indiana were in trouble” if you think that those states aren’t important, when we control basically all of the food and oil economy. Come on

4222 2018-12-11 17:21:58 Yaaas boo, tell me when you're ready. Also! We have to go to mkk plaza soon, I need to pick up some body oil and scrubs from Nature's bar before the end of the month.
4223 2018-12-11 17:21:58 Natural oil called “miror epf”... I take 3 drops 3 times a day when I feel sick, and I feel better by the end of the day. It knocks anything out and it’s totally natural.
4224 2018-12-11 17:21:53 Where’s a good place to get an oil change
4225 2018-12-11 17:21:51 Gun oil is the best!
4226 2018-12-11 17:21:45 I would prefer that they detail how much from oil and how much from gas separately - they are two different beasts with competing agendas.
4227 2018-12-11 17:21:41 I just find it funny how people want to pass over 100% of the blame to the government. Most conservatives like to claim they’re fiscally responsible, that doesn’t seem to be the case with their voting population and by the looks of the oil industry, neither politicians.
4228 2018-12-11 17:21:33 Just like how men accounted for 92.5% of all workplace death. Oil rig, contructions workers, grounds maintenance workers, etc. All predominantly men.
4229 2018-12-11 17:21:27 Well I hope so Heid. 

But as SS told us on our site visit the Horsehill.

Oil exploration is a risky business and any number of unexpected problems can be throw up in front of you. Take Broadford Bridge for instance .

Horsehill is now a commercial well.

Brockham is an unknown.
4230 2018-12-11 17:21:20 sleeping with coconut oil on my hair overnight was the best decision i’ve made in a long time
4231 2018-12-11 17:21:19 加油！ Add oil
4232 2018-12-11 17:21:17 PUT BIO OIL
4233 2018-12-11 17:21:13 If the oil trade nuge is would be the biggest mistake they made yet. And that’s saying a lot

4235 2018-12-11 17:21:03 blocking anyone who says palm oil isn’t vegan because a lot of y’all have the privilege to avoid it. palm oil is in a lot of cheap & accessible foods. telling poor vegans they aren’t vegan because the only food they can afford contains palm oil is shitty and helps no one
4236 2018-12-11 17:20:52 Grüezi  Guru @GuruAnaerobic,

what about rapeseed oil/canola oil? bad like the other seed oils ?
4237 2018-12-11 17:20:51 I can't figure out how the car went that far. It has to be nearby. I'm guessing it was going very fast to have hit that many cars and lost that many parts and so much oil.
4238 2018-12-11 17:20:45 BODY SHOOK HANDS COPS STAY MAYBE MIRROR HANGING SIDE SWALLOW MY LIFE ALL TAPES HAVE BEEN ERASED NOTHING DELICIOUS OIL POOL
4239 2018-12-11 17:20:44 I’ve never tried that gun oil lube yet they said that’s for saltine sex
4240 2018-12-11 17:20:42 Stress is toxic and poisons peole and communities. The COL is expert at creating stress
- strikes disrupting Christmas plans, surgeries , schooling. 
- oil and gas decision affecting jobs
- fuel prices creating poverty
Worst government in my lifetime
4241 2018-12-11 17:20:40 EIA sees OPEC-15 crude oil production up 80kbpd to 32.98kbpd in November, with losses In Iran (-300kdpbd to 3.1mbpd) offset by gains in Saudi Arabia (+200kbpd to 10.92mbpd), Libya (+70kbpd), Angola (+50kbpd), Iraq and Venezuela (both each +40kbpd).

4243 2018-12-11 17:20:01 So basically, from construction and oil and gas development?
4244 2018-12-11 17:19:51 Two portions of snake oil when you’re ready, thanks Richard.
4245 2018-12-11 17:19:22 My point is because oil is such a large fungible market a boycott will not have an impact.
4246 2018-12-11 17:19:21 BREAKING: A Jamaican parliamentary committee considering a report on rampant corruption at the state's oil refinery #Petrojam has been shut down mid-hearing on instruction from Karl Samuda, Speaker and senior official of the @AndrewHolnessJM administration.
4247 2018-12-11 17:19:20 Seriously??? FWT still has that kind of juice???  Or should I say oil???

4250 2018-12-11 17:18:55 I'll give you the context at you've stated but how about some actual facts to back it up. I don't think that's to much to ask. The reported money shows he takes LOTS from oil.
4251 2018-12-11 17:18:45 Interested to hear your opinion.  I've been real apprehensive to try one.  I had some weird Christmas Latte last year that had pine tree oil or some weird extract in it from one of the local coffee shops and it messed me up for the next several hours.
4252 2018-12-11 17:18:40 Then your issue is with Irving Oil. They’re the only folks buying Saudi oil.
4253 2018-12-11 17:18:35 Their kaptain kielbasa dabbed in machine oil thrusted into their love canal
4254 2018-12-11 17:18:32 My mom bought me some really nice, organic chicken breasts. So today I’m making lemon pepper breasts, roasted baby gold potatoes with olive oil, salt, and pepper, and green beans.
4255 2018-12-11 17:18:21 Burgers tonight. I mix finely chopped onions, parsley and paprika into the meat. The buns are whole wheat organic. I dress with slices of red onion, relish, organic chopped tomatoes in oil and organic Dijon mustard. Housemate gives them 5 grunts :)
4256 2018-12-11 17:17:55 From which oil can still be seen on the water over the wreck.
4257 2018-12-11 17:17:48 People of Mizoram rejected both Congress & BJP as they have an alternative in MNF .The haunted SC STs , harassed muslim minorities , deprived farmers , unemployed youth + arrogant oil companies,nightmare demonetisation and extortionist GST voted against BJP in MP , CG & Rajasthan
4258 2018-12-11 17:17:45 Russians could go into Venezuela and fix the broken pumps. Libtards in Venezuela thought they could run the oil company but now it’s a double disaster.
4259 2018-12-11 17:17:43 Ya great but that will take decades and the problem is now.  And again great to say we need a green economy, I am with you, but the oil man's greed knows no bounds. Until we can make recycling and alternatives profitable laws will be hard to pass.
4260 2018-12-11 17:17:43 Feels as though many are preaching on their pedestals about the evils of oil without realizing that the pedestal they're on is made from the oil/gas industry. It's a slap in the face for sure.  #hypocrisy
4261 2018-12-11 17:17:37 Snake oil salesman today, grifter tomorrow, confidence man the next. Corruption wears many hats.
4262 2018-12-11 17:17:33 I never thought putting oil in my car would clear my acne, cure my depression, and fix my brakes. Miracles are real
4263 2018-12-11 17:17:20 Castor oil on ur brows before u go to sleep!!!
4264 2018-12-11 17:17:14 What do you say. Trump's Oil Plan Authors versus the polar bears, hand to paw combat. Winner takes all.
4265 2018-12-11 17:17:01 going to get an oil change as a single woman is an extreme sport
4266 2018-12-11 17:16:59 Cranking thought it ran out of gas out in 3 gallons won’t start thought it needed oil added 2 quarts still won’t start my boss bout to get it towed tho he dnt wanna put no money into it
4267 2018-12-11 17:16:51 Sunny D got canola oil in it 
4268 2018-12-11 17:16:51 Conventional oil: every 3,000 miles or 3 months

Synthetic oil: every 5,000-10,000 miles or 6-12 months
4269 2018-12-11 17:16:50 straight oil
4270 2018-12-11 17:16:43 True
4271 2018-12-11 17:16:38 Russia gas pipeline to boost grip on Ukraine, Europe: U.S. diplomat: Supplying Russia with Military build-up monies thru gas/oil is the dumbest move ever. It MUST be stopped ASAP,more dangerous than Iran issue creating yet again a West vs Russia military buildup.
4272 2018-12-11 17:16:35 NOW: Confusion at Gordon House forces the premature adjournment of the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament in the middle of its deliberations on the findings of a comprehensive audit of the state-owned oil refinery #Petrojam, @LivernBarrett reports.

4278 2018-12-11 17:16:12 Bernie got hundreds of millions dollars worth of oil and gas industry donations in 2016. It’s just that it was the Russian oil and gas industry
4279 2018-12-11 17:16:12 A tragic woodland. It sounds serene, it smells like oil, it's in a state of anarchy, and it's a bit almond.
4280 2018-12-11 17:16:04 Oh so it was just pure coincidence the headline you posted didn’t mention booze. The only reason you shared that article was because CBD oil was in the headline. If it was “just” a drunk driving incident you never would’ve shared it. Doesn’t fit your agenda.
4281 2018-12-11 17:15:54 Trump is a globalist what did you expect? A President who would create millions of jobs globally to restore the biosphere or a war economy?  NYT do you like wars for oil or peace through planet restoration?
4282 2018-12-11 17:15:53 Man I need to change my transmission oil I just really don’t wanna pay for it

4288 2018-12-11 17:15:25 1 high oil price 2 too much taxation 3 GST on small businessman 4 Waiver of farmers loan 5 remove Arun Jaitly
4289 2018-12-11 17:15:15 Everything we buy and use comes from oil and gas.  How else would it get into your hands?  Boats, trucks, trains, planes, cars, etc all necessary.
4290 2018-12-11 17:15:07 やったー
4291 2018-12-11 17:15:05 we will focus on the ones in rUK, if you want to be blinded by the snake oil salesmen in the SNP be our guest, also I'm a Celt I can't be a colonist we were here first, so as you were
4292 2018-12-11 17:15:02 The guy doing my oil change is as confused as I am
4293 2018-12-11 17:15:01 @morrisons Please advise your policy regarding the use of palm oil in your products, thank you.
4294 2018-12-11 17:15:00 Study: Obama was super amazing AF in every way and like totes the greatest President EVAR!
4295 2018-12-11 17:14:59 Totally agreed! If anything, they’ve driven us further into the hole by embracing corporations and oil companies (instead of regulating and pushing for green innovation and solutions to global disaster).
4296 2018-12-11 17:14:57 Oh oh Individual-1 @realDonaldTrump daddy Putin is investing 5 billion on oil production with Venezuela and you're not invited.
4297 2018-12-11 17:14:56 Can someone please tell me where I can get tea tree oil from ??
4298 2018-12-11 17:14:52 Same  I’ve been using aloe and vitamin e oil from those capsules. it’s the only thing that works. Or Shea butter.
4299 2018-12-11 17:14:51 T2F - lawyer points that 1 mil regime had tactical, other strategic relationship w/ militants as if distinction is imp. NasimZehra destroys.
4300 2018-12-11 17:14:50 I could be way off, but I don't think they were using a piston engine to get to the moon. Also the oil change places want to make more money. If full synthetic oil, you can go 10k-20k miles. Depends on manufacturer of the vehicle.
4301 2018-12-11 17:14:49 Amin. Thank you so much.
4302 2018-12-11 17:14:43 10k is even too much for an Akara business, also remember the loan aint for starters, but lets assume a starter:1 paint of beans is 1850, 5litre of groundnut oil is 2000, onion, pepper, coal or gas, even with 5k in Lagos you can start an akara bizz, wetin this one dey talk??
4303 2018-12-11 17:14:34 BF; Boobs naki sunyi slacken! Baki shafa musu oil ne?
GF; Ah ah fah!nina kwantar dasu, inka aureni zasu tashi ai baby 

! Wai zasu tashi
4304 2018-12-11 17:14:29 Has since 1947 Didn't before
Since we have so many issues trying to sell our oil right now we could proactively look at other developing industries we have fewer challenges in
COL was a red herring
Non oil voices are all the voices for economic diversification v. focus on oil
4305 2018-12-11 17:14:27 1. 75% of $ came in large donations over $200. 
2. Donors = 25+ oil & gas executives. 30 donations were the max $2,700.
3. O’Rourke broke his No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge of rejecting campaign donations over $200 from fossil fuel PACs/execs endorsed by 16 environmental groups
4306 2018-12-11 17:14:26 Sometimes its true
4307 2018-12-11 17:14:24 So basically,  the contributions we put in as Albertans,  can pay for most of the Saudi Oil that Quebec imports,  to the detriment of Canada's own Oil, losing an estimated $80M per day  !
#FederalCommonSenseMath ?
What ever happened to  #BuyCanadian  ?
4308 2018-12-11 17:14:23 I always see articles about how girl scout cookies use palm oil 
4309 2018-12-11 17:14:22 #Sindh ke logo ko milega kuch bhi nhi phele bhi #Sindh se gas or oil niklta raha hai lekin kuch nhi mila unko un factories se #Sindhi worker tak nikale gaye hen. #Sindhi Engineer tak nhi bharti kiye jaty kyun aisa #Sindh ne koi khaas jurm kiya hai is mulk ka ya unke logo ka?
4310 2018-12-11 17:14:11 When you became a border Ba, Lagos life sha, we'll goto school from 7-5pm then rush to Islamiyya n close after 6 , then come home n do islamiyya 8-10pm, repeat same cycle till you get uni admission.
4311 2018-12-11 17:14:11 Well I guess you will continue to fall for Charter rights BS? If that's the case, how come we continue to import oil from Saudi where there is no charter rights whatsoever? 

Again, why did he expedite the payment when it could have gone to courts further for appeal?
4312 2018-12-11 17:14:06 Oh yeah because separating would be soooo good for Alberta.... We have no ports and one trading partner who would get even deeper discounts on oil. We would get SCREWED!!! Dumbest idea ever
4313 2018-12-11 17:14:03 NOVAK SAYS RUSSIAN OIL PRODUCTION IN DECEMBER TO BE AT OCTOBER LEVEL: IFX. #OOTT
4314 2018-12-11 17:14:01 The mature ones cant grasp the gravity of what it means to run the country: no fuel, no cooking oil, high prices, dysfunctional hospitals, shortages of drugs..............
4315 2018-12-11 17:13:55 They can drown in their oil too. We will never forget this.
4316 2018-12-11 17:13:53 Again context.They didn’t have the staff to double check where each donor worked.They didn’t not donate in the company name.I know one Exxon executive spouse that worked hard for Beto but the family donation would have been pegged as oil instead of coming from an unemployed Texan

4355 2018-12-11 17:10:38 If you're going to try that can you give about example. I mean, a person who gives $2,000 and is a VP oil shipping company would count. But do we care about every individual contribution or company's? He's in Texas, every other person is connected to oil and gas.

4357 2018-12-11 17:10:33 The second discussant @DanHaberly reminds us it is important not to treat the Gulf as a homogeneous thing, and highlights that as long as we use oil, Gulf state will remain capital exporters-and there is a real demand for this money in many western countries.
4358 2018-12-11 17:10:23 Also just like the oilfield here in Texas people in West Texas literally can start out at 65,000 and work 6 months of the year, but do you think the people with degrees are really busting their ass on the rig? Oil field has minimal Job security even with a degree, but it helps

4366 2018-12-11 17:09:52 Not in Baker City, Oregon, prices are still above $3.15 per gal reg and over $3.35 diesel. Diesel cheaper to produce, a by product of refined fuel? There Must be investigations by Congress into price gouging by Big Oil. Do some research!
4367 2018-12-11 17:09:51 Hypothetically, without the Artic convoys, the Germans may have consolidated their lines, waited out the winter and then renewed their offensive while the Russians were still reeling. If they’d utilised the oil in the Caucus and from Iran, that would’ve been a game-changer.
4368 2018-12-11 17:09:38 He wakes up a little while later, hair mussed and eyes half-lidded. The smell of coffee is entrancing, and he drinks it without much question.

...After the caffeine settles in, he realizes he didn't make it himself. And there's no motor oil in it, so it couldn't of been Dum-E.
4369 2018-12-11 17:09:37 We should end the war in the ME. Stop all financial aid, refuse all refugees & lead an embargo of their oil. In a few months they’ll be fighting with sticks & stones. The war will be over.
4370 2018-12-11 17:09:31 Of all categories of Nigerians I expected the oil workers to be a set massively behind this govt but discussing with a few today I was vilified to even hear Atiku from their mouths.

Sorry this might be a somewhat long thread but I'm not expecting anybody to read it so no issues
4371 2018-12-11 17:09:21 He slept in his depends, took off all of his clothes, rubbed down in baby oil, he had a peanutbutter facial, then he doused himself in zippo lighter fluid and ran around the WH naked, threatening to light himself up! Pence had to tackle him and escorted him into the playroom.

4380 2018-12-11 17:08:40 Apparently you didn’t bother reading the article once again. Defendant admitted to drinking alcohol, using a muscle relaxant and vaping CBD oil. Now there is a little girls life senselessly taken away. That’s not fear mongering it’s reality...
4381 2018-12-11 17:08:38 > I did read the article, it's rank speculation about motives without any underlying research or evidence.

We must have read very different articles. The author mentioned the relative percentage donations coming from gas & oil vs. other sources for Beto and others.

4390 2018-12-11 17:07:24 Hahahaha lol
4391 2018-12-11 17:07:22 The issue is the hypocrisy in purchasing Saudi oil ( one of the highest polluting countries ) and stopping our pipeline that would support the Canadian economy and in the end the have less of an impact on global pollution.  We fix that, most of the nonsense would stop.

It will be used for nuclear power and medicine, USA does not have a shortage of uranium, and Russia already has 4000 nukes so who cares if they want to make more. essentially no different than selling oil or coal
4407 2018-12-11 17:05:47 We shouldn't rush into flawed, expensive and ineffective 'solutions'. Tree planting on the scale and of the type proposed by @Nature4Climate would be virtually impossible anyway, but would come with massive potential dangers and risks.

4456 2018-12-11 17:02:12 Vos decís que Peron no tuvo "indefiniciones frente a los militares" (por ahí tenés razón e "indefiniciones" es demasiado generoso), no reprimió obreros (hay unos cuantos ferroviarios que dirían lo contrario)? Y lo de arreglos con los yanquis... hubo una tal Californian Oil.

4458 2018-12-11 17:02:09 Apples, olive oil, coffee, salmon, green tea, seeds, and more have all been found to promote good lung health. They all contain anti-inflammatory properties that help keep your airways working as they should.

4459 2018-12-11 17:02:04 "Just add cbd oil to everything. It really works!" - every plan ever
4460 2018-12-11 17:02:02 This will certainly occur, primarily for 1 reason. The EROI for oil is flailing badly & soon the investment 2 produce a barrel will equal the net energy gained. Thus far they have thwarted  this reality w/unlimited amounts of piled up debt @ 0%. High rates will expedite issue.
4461 2018-12-11 17:02:01 ねますみ〜
4462 2018-12-11 17:01:51 Thing is, if QC were suddenly awash in oil (unlikely) and gas from shale, a market for AB production would dry up. I wonder if this is being thought through.
4463 2018-12-11 17:01:49 And at no cost!
4464 2018-12-11 17:01:45 Research his voting record on offshore oil drilling.
4465 2018-12-11 17:01:25 Not sure what part you’re arguing against? Are you saying the West doesn’t contribute more into equalization than they receive? Or do you dispute that Quebec is resisting the movement of western oil through their province? Perhaps you believe budgets balance themselves?
4466 2018-12-11 17:01:17 Dear Sir:
I have been requested by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company to contact you for assistance in resolving a matter. The Nigerian National Petroleum Company has recently concluded a large number of contracts for oil exploration in the sub-Sahara region. The contracts h
4467 2018-12-11 17:01:16 Especially from the people of Yemen. They'll never forget Canada's championing of human rights by selling arms to Saudi Arabia & buying their oil as they bury their dead.
4468 2018-12-11 17:01:14 I would not be surprised that people who live in Texas might work in oil & gas. I would not assume that they would all be Republicans.
4469 2018-12-11 17:01:10 Thank you President Trump , The Monkees before you were too scared and non business savvy to make the USA Powerhouse in energy and oil!
4470 2018-12-11 17:00:58 The Trump Admin. is working to begin oil exploration on the coastal plain of the Beaufort Sea in Alaska. Supporters believe this will create a stronger economy. Opposers believe that this will cause harm to wildlife and hurt the environment. @nytimeshttp://ow.ly/j3iE30mVSEG

4474 2018-12-11 17:00:47 I bet BHO is soooooo mad at MBS. Too bad, so sad.
I find it telling, by the reaction of the sympathetics, that MBS has demolished a major player in the globalist/commie playbook.
My guess is Khashaggi is/was CIA Deep State agent & MBS has neutralized/gained control of a faction.

4484 2018-12-11 17:00:14 Except 4 the case of Quebec. They have plenty of income, enough they run budget surpluses. Outrageous they get transfer payments from oil producing provinces going thru true hard times. This especially in light of them opposing ways for that oil 2B shipped. Acts like spoiled kid
4485 2018-12-11 17:00:12 Just like the oil and coal control the energy market and silence green energy, and big pharma stifles the idea of Medicare for all touting it as an impossibility for a free market while every major country that has it has a flourishing health care economy.

4488 2018-12-11 16:59:49 Jesus, @CNN. I know you need advertisers, but this @pcmatic stuff is flat out lies. Like, it doesn't get more dishonest than them. They don't DETECT ransomware. They are using internal Windows Admin settings to force all .exe files to require a whitelist. It is digital snake oil!
4489 2018-12-11 16:59:44 most of them have palm oil in them so, best to be avoided anyway. :(
4490 2018-12-11 16:59:44 yeah, in fact I do, have you tried thc oil? If you have, you would know why, lol.
4491 2018-12-11 16:59:41 Couldn't afford oil even if my oil boiler was fixed anyway
4492 2018-12-11 16:59:33 what store down here has amla oil?
4493 2018-12-11 16:59:22 Russia wants to sell his gas, S-A wants to sell their oil, Trump is just being stupid, somebody explain to him that climate change is bad for buisiness pls.
4494 2018-12-11 16:59:21 Not really. I take my used oil to advance auto parts to have it recycled.
4495 2018-12-11 16:59:21 If I remember, I carry some Olbas oil and a hanky and sniff into that. Nobody has complained - so far! Desperate measures and all that. It's smelly food that gives me the boak too.

4497 2018-12-11 16:59:10 Quebec PM Legault is taking a political shortcut saying that’s there’s no social acceptability for pipelines in the province! Just ask to those of Lake Megantic whose families and friends burned down a few years ago with a freak oil train from the Bakken! Pipelines are safer!
4498 2018-12-11 16:58:58 Garnier - Ultimate Blends In Coconut oil!! You’ll never go back! Thank me later.
4499 2018-12-11 16:58:41 Sir ji, when you will realize that OIL is a big factor it's not only used by richest people but also using poor like farmers. You put GST 28% on pipe, pumps(motor) do you know this items are using for farming?Tell the Rafale aircraft price to the people.Otherwise in 2019 
4500 2018-12-11 16:58:39 Exactly. There is no need for refineries if oil is on its way out
4501 2018-12-11 16:58:33 Looking for my kutus" oil and its nowhere to be found. Am devostated :(
4502 2018-12-11 16:58:30 It’s probably a win that the Saudis killed that puke.
4503 2018-12-11 16:58:18 Filled up the oil tank yesterday. 500 Litres cost €370 . Big drop in price lately.
4504 2018-12-11 16:58:16 But if you are in Alberta and unemployed or don’t have a high paying oil job, Seeing the social programs that Quebec is able to run like say cheap daycare that you could use,  why then does it not make sense that you’d want switch positions?
4505 2018-12-11 16:58:12 Geez Avi--yes to "relentlessly hostile to #leap" no to "captured by oil." Notley and Alberta #NDP believe they are standing up for workers. But change gonna come, and a real workers' party would be getting out in front of it. 1/

The networks are literally dumbing down Americans...every day...
4509 2018-12-11 16:57:32 No one talking about petrol price making record. And the decreas of price is not propornate to crude oil

4511 2018-12-11 16:57:26 he's probably referring to the snake oil salesmen nats who are trying to position labour into a second ref for no reason other than to try to justify a second indyref

4513 2018-12-11 16:57:10 That Russian and Saudi oil will make it all okay

4515 2018-12-11 16:57:03 But its a myth that if you have a slow metabolism you cant do anything about it, you can your metabolism becomes slow through lack of exercise and poor diet, your body is a machine oil it well and it function to its max, treat it poorly and like any machine it will break down!
4516 2018-12-11 16:56:49 I thought the same thing, caramelized citrus with a smoky herb infused olive oil? Add some toasted sourdough and a thing of goat cheese, would definitely order that or just make it.

4520 2018-12-11 16:56:38 How to explain #ANWR to oil companies; @realdonaldtrump will not be president for ever. It will be more expensive to clean it up than just going there. It’s not @algore talking. I fought to protect it 20 years ago, I’ll fight for it today. With a comb you will fix the tundra.
4521 2018-12-11 16:56:37 The Saudi news told all the Middle East that the reason oil prices were dropping is Kuwait was not part of Saudi and was pumping out oil not in accordance with agreements so that the price of oil was dropping.  Saddam began to march on Kuwait who did not have a standing army
4522 2018-12-11 16:56:35 O’Rourke broke the No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge—a promise 2 reject donations > $200 from fossil fuel PACs and executives that he endorsed/signed.

Of the $430,000 - 75 % came from“large” donations > $200. Donors include > 3 dozen oil & gas execs. > 30 were the max.  $2,700.
4523 2018-12-11 16:56:33 oil company sycophant leads the way cause skateboards
4524 2018-12-11 16:56:31 Or coconut oil
4525 2018-12-11 16:56:20 created Kuwait allowed Democratic elections told everyone who wanted to belong to a Democracy to go to Kuwait. Then they began to drop the price of oil & Saddam's economy of Iraq began to suffer along with other countries. Kuwait was having a celebration as a newly set up country
4526 2018-12-11 16:56:16 I find it more concerning that Labour want to destroy our oil and gas industry.
4527 2018-12-11 16:56:13 Sir now time has come ....change ur development agenda and start sending corrupt /tainted Congress leader to jail....start giving relief to ur core voter by giving income tax relief....put more subsidiary on oil prices .....waive off all loan to farmer across india

4531 2018-12-11 16:55:51 You think the end of fossil fuels is coming any time soon?  Did you send this tweet out on two sticks or what?  Like most addicts you don't believe you are addicted to oil, but take it away and your world would crumble.
4532 2018-12-11 16:55:51 Having watched the oil culture grow I can tell you with certainty they take the environment and sustainability more serious than most cities. They invest billions into clean tech. It's not O&G its govt. that needs to invest in a way that doesn't kill economies
4533 2018-12-11 16:55:42 The oil business runs the province and not even the most well-meaning New Democrat can imagine how it could be different.
4534 2018-12-11 16:55:38 They sure want that oil in the Black Sea, don't they?
4535 2018-12-11 16:55:33 You can't talk about 99% while you get close to million dollars collecting from Saudis, Banks, Oil companies, military complexes for your disgusting speeches. You, your husband and your daughter should be tried for crime against humanity worldwide.
4536 2018-12-11 16:55:13 Really?
What will you be driving?

4537 2018-12-11 16:55:13 Needing an oil change has taken over my life
4538 2018-12-11 16:55:08 Make sure your car is ready for your drive home! Campus Police will be doing oil and tire checks, windshield washer fluid, and giving out free hot chocolate. All happening today in Lot 13 from 3:30-5:30 p.m.
4539 2018-12-11 16:55:06 You clueless ass... oil & gas as a percentage of AB GDP has been falling for over a decade. And AB still bears the brunt of carrying the pathetic losers across this country who can't develop their own provincial economies. All the while dipshits attack the oil industry.

4548 2018-12-11 16:54:35 And I said, "Hey kid, you think that's oil? Man, that ain't oil, that's blood"
I wonder what he was thinking when he hit that storm, or was he just lost in the flood?
4549 2018-12-11 16:54:26 Did you discuss how they have murdered & starved thousands of children in Yemen with the help of the US? Did you discuss how they oppress women? Did you discuss how they murdered a US resident? Absolutely disgusting what this administration does for oil barons.
4550 2018-12-11 16:54:21 Oh no! That's not awesome, Amanda! If that happens again, we recommend wiping the area with a soft cloth soaked in vegetable oil. 
4551 2018-12-11 16:54:14 Are you OK with US Navy protecting oil shipments? Oil companies dont pay for that. Are you OK with additional health expenses because of emissions from coal and cars? You pay for it not oil and coal companies.
4552 2018-12-11 16:54:00 American government idiocy has no boundaries, not even when every species on this planet is threatened with extinction. We must stop fracking and drilling for oil. It's a no-brainer. #BanFracking #KeepItInTheGround #EndAmericanIdiocy

Not exciting enough??

Built $250k International Airport ON TOP of the only rich Oil reserve on the map 

Almost FLOODED the city building Alcatraz asylum.

4555 2018-12-11 16:53:49 So I made it up but it was great:

Peel chop and roast a whole butternut squash.
In a big pan fry off 3 onions in butter and oil.
Add 1 pealed cored chopped pear.
Cook till the onions are a little golden.
Add half a tsp fennel seeds, squash + 1.5l veg stock. S&P. Blend + taste.
4556 2018-12-11 16:53:41 Clean it while wet with a damp cloth. To keep it from getting rusty, oil it up. To a deep clean, rub with sand.

4563 2018-12-11 16:53:15 people forget the oil got her...but the gang ultimately stopped them from drilling so it was a good day with a group high five
4564 2018-12-11 16:53:14 Nope. Beto has broken his pledge not to take mone from oil industry (pledge includes executives). Not only that, his work shows he is doing pro oil bussines and against saving climate of Earth

4567 2018-12-11 16:53:02 I was told I don’t but they say if you use a different type of oil you can mess your car up.,
4568 2018-12-11 16:52:59 No oil and gas will be around for a long time and there are clean technologies being developed with them. Canada's economy depends largely on our oil and gas reserves so we still need pipelines.
4569 2018-12-11 16:52:56 same ugh but i use coconut oil it makes em a lil longer
4570 2018-12-11 16:52:54 Again, irrelevant to a thread specifically about #quebec, where local mayors are given all sorts of airtime to slag “dirty oil” while Saudi tankers chug through the St. Lawrence.
4571 2018-12-11 16:52:53 Devil is a liar  so that’s how I was frying yam and oil almost poured on my Leg
4572 2018-12-11 16:52:51 we must absolutely dismantle the state-corporate infrastructure of oil to make a fucking dent in saving our climate.
4573 2018-12-11 16:52:47 @JohnMannMP Cuadrilla fracked again today at Preston New Road, Blackpool & they've had 10 earthquakes since, the biggest being 1•5
So why does @johnmcdonnellMP say he'll give the rich Oil & Gas companies more tax breaks & support
Labour promised to ban Fracking not fund it
4574 2018-12-11 16:52:47 Everybody has the right as we have the right & responsibility to call out politicians that aren't working for us! The last 40 years proves money means more to many politicians. We've looked at Beto's voting record and his cash ties. He takes cash for JPAC, big oil  and more

4578 2018-12-11 16:52:07 Thanks, Art. I think our industry needs to open their eyes a bit to the effects (whether manmade or otherwise) to a changing climate. One can still be bullish and supportive of the oil and gas industries and STILL support an overall agenda that tackles the potential outcomes.
4579 2018-12-11 16:51:58 Why hasn't any of these countries taken steps to ban the 15 largest cargo ships in the world from using crude oil in internat waters? That would cut emissions as much as all cars in the world combined (approx 1 billion cars). Or do they just want to collect some more taxes? #hoax
4580 2018-12-11 16:51:47 Maybe it’s a free oil change at pep boys.
4581 2018-12-11 16:51:46 Latest ‘#OPEC’ agreement can be summarised as: A well managed Russian effort to get Saudi Arabia to make significant cut in #oil production. All other actors are superfluous.
4582 2018-12-11 16:51:43 But leftists intentionally create and encourage poverty conditions to give their sjw supporters something noble to do, and issues to run for office on, with bleeding heart promises to fix the problems they created! border /immigration/inner cities/climate/oil
4583 2018-12-11 16:51:42 Is that why 80% of the oil companies are exempted from the carbon tax?
4584 2018-12-11 16:51:38 Politicians like Legault come and go what they say forgotten in a day #Alberta is innovation not separation looking forward not back like the #oil rebranded energy companies Pot & Tech maybe the way
4585 2018-12-11 16:51:36 The oil revenue should not be shared.  End of story.  If separation is needed to achieve that, good.  Im sick of listening to loser trust funders talk.
4586 2018-12-11 16:51:24 Really his words “The Quebec Premier, while answering on Energy East, said “there is no social acceptability for oil in Quebec.” But Quebec politicians are apparently fine with the money our oil creates - including the extra $1.4b they will receive next year.”

4588 2018-12-11 16:51:18 I am looking at this and a global level HRC is donors were not strictly US-based. The corporations may be US based but they originate from Saudi Arabia her major downer, Israel another shell set of donors as well as our participation for the past 18 years in the Middle East oil.
4589 2018-12-11 16:51:13 @SubmissiveLexi I love your tits! Do you have a worship video? Or oil and titty fuck?
4590 2018-12-11 16:50:58 End Equalization, Fully develop the oil sands in Alb and Sask, develop the Shale gas reserves in Man, Ont and Que build refineries and shipping capability for both coasts, expose the foreign lobby paying for the attack on our energy and sovereignty. And use the Fed power to do it
4591 2018-12-11 16:50:58 BJP has given a immense pain to its followers and deshavaktas. Never you heard the advice of your welwisher, oil has ruined all the expectations of the followers. 19 -3=16 states, you never thought to brought petroleum products under GST r not reduced the price bfr eln@BJP4India
4592 2018-12-11 16:50:58 Why must we pay for your socialist programs when you aren’t willing to develop your resources? Pay your own way, stop being a leech on this country - you hate our oil so put your money where your mouth is, stop taking transfer payments from Alberta that are from oil revenue

4595 2018-12-11 16:50:28 Yes it jumped out at me last week, I wondered how long it would be until the savvy snapped it up. R/R -25% v's +90% IMO. News flow/stronger Oil/ trading higher over the pond, all looks set up for a run. #TXP
4596 2018-12-11 16:50:22 how much is your pipeline worth which we paid for , the total amount of oil subsidies received from our tax largesse , how much the EI enhancements ..two now in the last 3 yrs ..which btw I don't resent cuz we're citizens of one nation and have a responsibility to one another...
4597 2018-12-11 16:50:14 the new Nafta, he got what he wanted, China caved or is about to to tarriffs, Canada caved, Opec increased oil production, North Korea backed down...
4598 2018-12-11 16:50:10 He's draining the swamp. And then filling it back up with oil so that everything in it dies. Making America great one oil spill at a time.
4599 2018-12-11 16:50:05 Worst part of oil painting??? Waiting for it to dry when you have a lot of ideas andnjust want to work
4600 2018-12-11 16:49:46 Google the northern boundary of the Utica formation that extends north from Montreal, the Macasty Shale formation that is the gulf of the St. Lawrence (oil & gas formations found)
4601 2018-12-11 16:49:45 Engine oil 
4602 2018-12-11 16:49:39 Cuadrilla fracked again 
today at Preston New Road, Blackpool and they've had 10 more  earthquakes since, the biggest being 1•5
Why do you Labour and you 
@johnmcdonnellMP want to give these rich Oil & Gas companies more tax breaks & support
Labour promised to ban Fracking
4603 2018-12-11 16:49:37 Quebec, by being a belligerent neighbor, can stick it to Alberta and it’s oil but will still receive 2/3 of the transfer payments. That amounts to 13 billion from the 20 billion fund. Alberta $0. That is Can. under Trudeau. Cruel

4605 2018-12-11 16:49:28 He’s the primary cook. He changes the oil in my car and handles most all of the car maintenance. He’s sensitive to our son when it matters most.
4606 2018-12-11 16:49:25 The lie is the implication he took oil and gas money trying to make him sound like a lying corporatist. But in reality he took money from individuals who just worked in that industry (which a lot of people in Texas do).
4607 2018-12-11 16:49:25 You know you’re moving up in the world as an adult when you start getting oil changes at the dealership! #adulting #movinonup
4608 2018-12-11 16:49:25 You're absolutely right, that is true.  If you're so adamant about ideals being stifled, why do you let oil and coal slander and mislead the public on renewables, or big pharma and medicine silence Medicare for all.
4609 2018-12-11 16:49:23 Practically the whole environmental mvmt is suing the Trump admin for allowing Atlantic seismic blasting in  to search for oil. Here's the list: @Earthjustice @NRDC @oceana @CenterForBioDiv @selc_org are co-counsel. @SierraClub @Surfrider @Defenders & local groups are clients.
4610 2018-12-11 16:49:19 Why aren't BIgOil building refineries? If the oil companies won't build refineries, pipelines and other infrastructure it's because they can't make enough money doing it. It's certainly not because they feel they should do it for the benefit of AB. It's all about the bottom line.
4611 2018-12-11 16:49:15 オイルがあるから、みんな生きているんだYO
4612 2018-12-11 16:49:04 When they recommend putting warm oil in your ear to stop itching they don’t mean boiling hot oil fyi
4613 2018-12-11 16:48:58 Only money, transfer   Payments to buy Saudi oil is acceptable.
4614 2018-12-11 16:48:58 Was this from Becky’s presentation? During the oil & gas spike/craze?
4615 2018-12-11 16:48:53 How much gas and oil is in the oilfields and who paid for the exploration and oil rigs etc ? It wasn’t Scotland was it!!
Also who are you calling bigots? Back that statement up?
4616 2018-12-11 16:48:51 She's a real winner isn't she? #FreedomofSpeech is truly hilarious coming from her, and she's not even trying to be funny. #Ironic, don't ya think?
4617 2018-12-11 16:48:50 Christmas rice and oil for what? Give me the money woho !
4618 2018-12-11 16:48:50 especially soaked in oil. The toast would just suck it up, and lose structure.
4619 2018-12-11 16:48:49 PM's promise to work hard shd start right from 12th Dec and people feel the benefits by Jan"2019.GST OiL prices ,pension.promises input subsidyor production incentives to farmers  realistic MSP  PMAY are some of pressing demands .
4620 2018-12-11 16:48:48 This could have been a useful process but with Trump everything is directed towards making him feel important, self satisfied, and 'in charge'.. and 'powerful'.. As global oil interests scuffle over Arctic Sea rights, even crippled he could start a war.

4622 2018-12-11 16:48:11 Why, of course they do—oil/gas is their primary economic engines and they are not willingly going to give it up! Even if it kills the rest of us. This is pure greed and it is evil.
4623 2018-12-11 16:48:06 Recycling plastic water bottles helps to conserve natural resources, specifically oil, which is a nonrenewable natural resource available only in limited supply.
4624 2018-12-11 16:48:04 "Once considered disruptors, digital companies are now using the same strategies oil and tobacco companies used back in the 90s to project the illusion of an optimistic future — while their design teams are still tied to aggressive, revenue-driven, short-term metrics." #TrendsUX
4625 2018-12-11 16:48:01 The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that recycling one ton of plastic conserves approximately 3.8 barrels of crude oil. In 2008, 2.12 millions of plastic were recovered for recycling, the equivalent of roughly 7.6 million barrels of oil.
4626 2018-12-11 16:48:01 You bought the false narrative. My old neighborhood was 75% that worked in oil related companies and liked Beto’s message and sent in donations and then the breakdown of industries was twisted to make it sound like it was Corp oil. Please correct the context!!!
4627 2018-12-11 16:47:53 Re Blackman, Sturgeon, and cowardice: last week the FM flew to Poland to gift £1m of our budget to a Swiss playboy in the name of "fighting climate change". At the same time KB was telling WM that SNP policy is to maximise oil extraction & the oil industry should get a handout.
4628 2018-12-11 16:47:49 You don't even have a job!! Worried your benefits will be cut and thinking you'll get a share in the oil if Scotland was independent like all the other fools.
4629 2018-12-11 16:47:45 ADD OIL!!! ADD OIL!!!!!
4630 2018-12-11 16:47:44 I too was as blind as you once! Read Callaghan autobiography,  it was his backbenchers that had him out! Not snp! Read bushy eyebrows Dennis, admitting liebour lied about oil! Then take a look at the mcrone report! It did it for me! I wish I'd learned sooner. Red torys no more!
4631 2018-12-11 16:47:44 I fkn hate the dumb mosquito coils. Just start aggressively spraying rooms — and your dad — with the oil. Because no.
4632 2018-12-11 16:47:25 No difference. But both deserve to feel the consequences of their actions. Alberta’s portion of equalization should be held back from #quebec, & BC should stop getting refined products from Alberta. A tariff on ME oil imports wouldn’t hurt, but #Trudeau doesn’t have the guts.
4633 2018-12-11 16:47:22 After DOJ aggressively and actively IGNORED #18USC242 while US CITIZENS were gassed and beaten by FOREIGN Oil Co mercenaries and US troops our entire "Justice" System is a sick corporate fascist joke.

4647 2018-12-11 16:45:48 It wd be easy to put pressure on Saudi Arabai & Kuwait - just tell them we're not buying any more oil from them. We're going to have to cut our oil consumption anyway.
4648 2018-12-11 16:45:42 I mistakenly assumed I'd have more time before the edibles kicked in once. I ate seafood scampi cooked in THC oil my mother had made at the end of my work shift. It took 3 times as long to finish up that night bc I was so high my head floated off my shoulders to the ceiling.
4649 2018-12-11 16:45:40 We don’t like HRC because of her support for the following: the Iraq invasion, fracking, oil pipelines, big bank bailouts, deregulation of Wall Street, the patriot act, wars in general, for-profit healthcare, big pharma. (Not a comprehensive list) She’s basically a republican.

4657 2018-12-11 16:45:00 Who said anything about one prov being more important than another
You tell me what you're fighting for because so far you've just made random, disconnected, red herring statements
We need to stop defining AB by oil
We have more to offer
We need to stop shushing non oil voices
4658 2018-12-11 16:44:51 Cal desenvolupar un model de valoració d'empreses mitjanes del sector Oil&Gas per tenir l'atenció d'una noia, cada dia està més complicat lligar...
4659 2018-12-11 16:44:50 You need to catch up. Those donations were from INDIVIDUALS who work for the gas and oil industry. ie: regular Texas citizens who donated to his campaign.
4660 2018-12-11 16:44:40 I read an article that broke down the nuances of Bernie's donations from Pharma compared to HRC's in 2016. Essentially, it made valid point of individuals v group & PAC. Can't find it, but is this Beto thing similar? I saw many CEOs, so that's big, but lots of ppl work in oil.

4663 2018-12-11 16:44:28 Alberta always has an excuse for why everything is everybody else’s fault and has bitched about equalization forever. There have been tough times for the oil biz before. Harper did nothing on equalization instead preferring to buy votes in Quebec. It’s his formula. Fool. #cdnpoli
4664 2018-12-11 16:44:22 Also it should be at the beginning of the pipe at the point of production, forcing coal, nat gas and oil plants to close asap
4665 2018-12-11 16:44:11 Like to add my thanks to @IcelandRichard @IcelandFoods for their exclusion of palm oil from products - hope more supermarkets follow their example. Went to Borneo 10 years ago and wept at the mass destruction of the forests for palm oil. #nopalmoilchristmas
4666 2018-12-11 16:44:05 Also better than changing oil, and rebuilding engines however you can’t put a turbo on it

4668 2018-12-11 16:43:55 You're responding to someone who says oil sold for $90-100 average for 5 years.
Says so much about education in Nigeria.

4675 2018-12-11 16:43:24 The countries that oppose the global warming agreement sell oil.  The US could economy is not as dependent on selling oil as the other countries, but the US leader appears to be dependent on Russia.
4676 2018-12-11 16:43:21 All I want for Christmas is for someone to give me a free oil change
4677 2018-12-11 16:43:20 well, he finally did ONE  thing.  he simultaneously wants them to sonic the seas which  will kill l000s of dolphins/whales/fish, you name it. he wants to go for the oil which we shld NOT do or the spills will kill everything else.
4678 2018-12-11 16:43:04 There are items that are essential that are made of plastic, like parts of joint replacement prosthesis and such.  We should save the oil for that, but once again short term profits mean more to the powers that be than any truly sensible solution. Bamboo is cheap, too!

4689 2018-12-11 16:42:03 Excellent graph.  A very important Cdn economy impact that must also be highlighted is reflecting the strip pricing for Ed light oil bbl differential, as well.  Differentials have decreased to nearly ~$5/bbl from in excess of $40/bbl!

4692 2018-12-11 16:41:35 @michaelreeves08 Tea tree oil and spironolactone will help with the acne. Also consider The C Programming Language by Brian W Kerninghan and Dennis M. Ritchie if you want to up your game. Oh and some socks.

i bet you can guess what i’m doing today
4697 2018-12-11 16:41:08 Russia's True Intentions, is the "Oil"....
4698 2018-12-11 16:40:58 Another way to deal with it, if one is unable to afford a raw diet for their critters, cats specifically, is to add a high quality salmon oil, if not that, then virgin olive oil to their wet or dry food.  Approx. 1 T. per day for an adult cat.  Will also help with hairballs.

4715 2018-12-11 16:39:37 I think you’re splitting hairs.

From the article.

“75 percent has come in the form of “large” donations over $200. The donors include more than two dozen oil and gas executives. More than 30 donations were the maximum allowed amount of $2,700.”
4716 2018-12-11 16:39:34 If it smells like oil, feels like oil and tastes like oil, can we then safely say that this is all about oil?
4717 2018-12-11 16:39:24 My point is what my 1st tweet was You then pointed out that everything revolves around oil & I'm making a case for why that sells AB short & ignores many of us who have other things to revolve around & offer
This started with me saying AB is mine too, & I'm not in rwing or in oil
4718 2018-12-11 16:39:17 Producer Price Index (PPI) rose only 0.1% November, but dropped from 2.9% to 2.5% YoY.  This is due to drop in Oil.  The Core PPI rose 0.3% in November, and rose from 2.1% to 2.2% YoY.
4719 2018-12-11 16:39:16 Hi Andrea, our products contain RSPO certified palm oil. There's currently no feasible alternative ingredient. We are one of 3,000 RSPO members worldwide working together to develop and implement global standards for sustainable palm oil.
4720 2018-12-11 16:39:09 SBC arnica gel may help, castor oil packs used with a wheat warmer may also be worth a try 
4721 2018-12-11 16:39:08 I need to know if there is black pepper in any beans or on the chicken. AND sunflower oil used in cups or flour tortilla.
4722 2018-12-11 16:39:07 9 million barrels a day of oil is used for auto fuel. I wouldn't be investing in the dinosaur juice market going forward as nothing will be able to replace that number.
4723 2018-12-11 16:39:04 Yep. and the same guy that didn't know that the Department of Energy wasn't the Department of Oil and Gas Lobbying. He had no idea what the DOE did.
4724 2018-12-11 16:38:51 Go figure; all the oil nations
4725 2018-12-11 16:38:29 Aspirin comes from oil and gas? Genuinely curious @kpconservative haha
4726 2018-12-11 16:38:26 What do all those nations have in common?  Oil.  Makes me sick
4727 2018-12-11 16:38:22 We are recovering money from everywhere and customs remitting trillions on paper...borrowing and still selling crude oil! And after “almost” four years this administration can’t boost of anything other than sharing $28 and fighting corruption!
4728 2018-12-11 16:38:19 Cramer working for oil industry...   good luck.
4729 2018-12-11 16:38:18 #CdnPoli Almost everything else we buy has it's country of origin on the label.  Every gas pump in Canada should be clearly labelled where the refined oil came from, so consumers have a clear choice.
4730 2018-12-11 16:38:13 transmutation
-- n.
•  grapes must be crushed to make wine.
•  diamonds from under pressure.
•  olives are pressed to release oil.

so..whenever u feel crushed or under pressure.. u're in a powerful place of transmutation & transformation.
4731 2018-12-11 16:38:13 I’ve tried it with my oil skin and it still a mess to work with. So dry it drags.
4732 2018-12-11 16:38:13 Whoo, baby! They'd oil their drawers as a group at Brewers Twitter Central.
4733 2018-12-11 16:38:12 Real question...

Who is to say that a corporate exec can't still have political preferences? S/he could have a conscious and hope oil and fuel companies work reasonably in tandem with the world. People are more nuanced than black and white.
4734 2018-12-11 16:38:12 ｳﾚｼｲ...ｳﾚｼｲ...

あ、コミケ当選おめでとうございます(超今更)(言うタイミングが無かった)
4735 2018-12-11 16:38:05 Clearly not by doing what he did cause none of those big moves made the oil better. Some of the smaller ones like Talbot, Maroon were good. Thing I notice about pc is his utter lack of regard for value. He wants a piece or has an idea and doesn’t give a fuck about asset value
4736 2018-12-11 16:38:05 Anybody know somebody that sells the weed oil pens?

4738 2018-12-11 16:38:01 Hit up our store, buy the micro roller and the BlueZoo beard oil. We'll even give you a discount code in honor of you trying to become more manly! If you don't see improvement in a month or so, I'll eat my hat. 
4739 2018-12-11 16:38:01 Because he takes money from oil executives?
4740 2018-12-11 16:38:00 It’s no coincidence that the U.S. joins other major oil producers Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in rejecting science and blocking full endorsement of a critical UN climate accord. Also, not a coincidence that Mike Lee voted against Russian sanctions and protecting Mueller.
4741 2018-12-11 16:37:51 You know, for as much crap as millennials have been dealt for 'killing' various industries, I think we should flip the script a bit: namely, which industries we SHOULD be killing - free market, evolve or die, that sort of thing.

I'll start: the oil/gas industry. Electric or die.
4742 2018-12-11 16:37:49 Hi Jen, our products contain palm oil that is certified by RSPO. There is currently no feasible alternative ingredient. We are one of 3,000 RSPO members worldwide working together to develop and implement global standards for sustainable palm oil.

4749 2018-12-11 16:37:40 It's easier to be mad at an individual that travels as opposed to oil execs that knew of global warming in the 80s and the consequences of continued oil use and worked to discredit this truth but 
4750 2018-12-11 16:37:38 Note: On the whole, senior food is p similar to adult food, but with lower calories (older cats move less) and some kind of joint supplement added. So you can get similar benefits by giving salmon oil supplements!

Sad
4752 2018-12-11 16:37:22 Maybe also do a fact check on Sun Oil and who owns Suncor.
4753 2018-12-11 16:37:20 @JustinTrudeau Ban the use of Corexit as a dispersant for oil spills. It's highly toxic and makes the spill worse. Better yet stop spilling oil. Work for you? let's do it. #BCTOO
4754 2018-12-11 16:37:19 pain tea tree oil tbs coba sm rajin sheetmask. gausah pake sunscreeon toner atau essence serum gitu
4755 2018-12-11 16:37:17 Every thing can go through BC by boat except Canadian Oil.
Oil isn't prohibited, just Canadian oil.
4756 2018-12-11 16:37:04 And pals with Osama bid Laden and the Muslim brotherhood.
4757 2018-12-11 16:36:41 We have two million years of hominid evolution with animal fat, barely 200 with olive oil, and only in a small region. Amazes me that anyone could think that OO is the only healthful fat.
4758 2018-12-11 16:36:28 I hear ya. My father hated going overseas both when he was in the military and after he retired working for an oil company.  But I just mentioned the comment to illustrate why it's important for us to keep the 2nd Amendment

4770 2018-12-11 16:35:27 I'm not going to insult. But please do some research on US oil dependency.
4771 2018-12-11 16:34:59 really don’t want to do my oil change today 
4772 2018-12-11 16:34:52 could it be the oil in yuh waist? mek mi feel like i hada chase yuh
4773 2018-12-11 16:34:51 They must be in their gowns before sunrise. And it is their responsibility to make sure there is enough oil in their bedside lamps.

4775 2018-12-11 16:34:45 Ok, can we have the oil production video next please
4776 2018-12-11 16:34:45 I'm staring at my to-do list and wondering if I can cross Make Soap off of it even though I messed up the batch, over-heated the oil, and melted the soap molds...

It's that kind of day.
4777 2018-12-11 16:34:44 yes...look at the top...your message envelope should have a number one..
it is me (your virtual girlfriend )
4778 2018-12-11 16:34:22 This is a learning time for BJP, whenever you've veered off your original you've lost. Pls don't go licking sc or muslim votes, Better stick to your original motto of Hinduism. Do something or be ready to bite more dust. Onions or oil won't decide your future
4779 2018-12-11 16:34:21 Paper towels drain oil too and lmao it’s not being stored yet so why is the food being presented in a bucket  has nothing to do with bougie
4780 2018-12-11 16:34:03 I need a wheel alignment and a oil change. Somebody tell my dad call me real quick I’m tryna see somin.
4781 2018-12-11 16:33:58 Really disappointing to see energy give it all up with oil staying firm.
4782 2018-12-11 16:33:42 A ver hay que comprender que así sale mejor, si quieres ver cine lo puedes hacer de manera gratuita en el autocinema de Los Pinos. La nueva nomeklatura decide cuál película, no tú con tus malas mañas.
4783 2018-12-11 16:33:41 Another nail in the coffin of ‘journalism.’
4784 2018-12-11 16:33:38 Yet u support trump who wants to increase off shore drilling.  Every off shore disaster spews tons of oil into the ocean that great harm.  Both non-biodegradable products and drilling sb a priority.

4789 2018-12-11 16:32:59 @LorraineOLopez Hey thanks for following me! I'm a Young Living girl myself but I love clean living. Have you heard about CBD oil? It might interest you. I find it complements essential oils nicely. If you are interested, let me know!
4790 2018-12-11 16:32:58 I need to buy more tea tree oil bc my face is breaking out so bad ):
4791 2018-12-11 16:32:45 Also, he didn’t get that money from lobbyist in the oil & gas industry. He got that money from people that work in that industry. If I work on an oil rig and donate I then have to list my industry which is oil and gas. The bros are doing the most per usual.
4792 2018-12-11 16:32:38 Been ill since Friday but I bought some Olbas Oil yesterday morning and have been off my tits on it since then. It’s like hippy poppers. Feel great today and I’m now convinced of its unprecedented healing powers. Would smell again 10/10.
4793 2018-12-11 16:32:37 I bought in last Friday. 21p before #OIL crashed. Back to 17p looks a fair target as long as oil holds.
4794 2018-12-11 16:32:30 Lol, school and islamiyya was the only way for me to meet people, I want even allowed to go on errands
4795 2018-12-11 16:32:18 @Deus_Abscondis what is your issue with the oil pressure reading? Still that sampling rate of 64s for oil parameters in the FDR Allied Signal 980-4700-003?
4796 2018-12-11 16:32:17 mhh..  Oil Sands Build Uncompleted (OSBUC)?  ;)
4797 2018-12-11 16:32:13 The United States is exporting more energy than it imports. So,why do we bother importing anything at all? We should just keep ours and let the Middle East drink their oil.
4798 2018-12-11 16:32:06 “Hood forever. I just act like I'm civilized. Really what's in my mind is organizing a billion blacks to take over JP and Morgan Goldman and Sachs. Teach the world facts and give Saudi they oil back.” ~ NAS
4799 2018-12-11 16:32:00 Thats what Scotland keeps saying about the UK. 

Fascist westminster holding us to ransom all the time. Doing everything they can to stop Scotland escaping. Its a fucking conspiracy.

Westminster only want Scotland so they can steal all the oil and profit off our whiskey!
4800 2018-12-11 16:31:59 You can curse the oil and gas industry all you want. 

But keep in mind that the clothes on your back, the shoes on your feet, the product in your hair, the aspirin in your body, and the device you’re using all comes from crude oil and natural gas.
4801 2018-12-11 16:31:59 Oil, AND gas, makes up 8% of Canada’s GDP. 
It’s 25% in AB.
4802 2018-12-11 16:31:52 not only is it finals week but turns out my car battery is on the verge of dying and my oil change I had got done was leaking because my parts involved w/ that were failing!!!!
4803 2018-12-11 16:31:44 Agreed. Dems just want realistic, effective boarder control and a pathway for DACA recipients. Also, there’s no rule that it has to be one or the other. That’s like saying “do you want to drive there or drive up oil prices”. It’s arbitrary but sounds snappy.
4804 2018-12-11 16:31:39 The Trump administration argues the  virtues of continuing to rely on coal and oil. This is government sanctioned destruction of the planet and the future of human civilization. We have 12 years or less to dramatically cut CO2 emissions.
It is literally do or die
4805 2018-12-11 16:31:34 What about Israel, which was built on a desert by survivors of the pogroms and the holocaust. Not one drop of oil, and attacked by 5 countries on the day of its birth. And now, one of the world powers. Switzerland is a very bad exemple compared to this human miracle !
4806 2018-12-11 16:31:25 Wintergreen essential oil mixed with coconut oil or Shea butter, feels like icy hot and soothes inflammation/sore muscles 
4807 2018-12-11 16:31:21 Have you still not got heating, I have a small electric. Oil filled radiator if you're desperate.
4808 2018-12-11 16:31:13 Bueno quitaron una plataforma —la plataforma— de cine, pero ¡van a pasar Roma en Los Pinos! Quién hubiera soñado tal cosa.
4809 2018-12-11 16:31:07 oil is down overall everywhere. maybe its time to move on to new investments and stop whining about your old investments not being worth what they used to. if all this big oil money went into renewable energy no one would care about oil in 5 years.
4810 2018-12-11 16:31:03 There is definitely a preference here. I have sautéed veggies in lard and tallow and found the result greasy. Not too fond of the taste of tallow, either. Olive oil still rules for the veggie stir.
4811 2018-12-11 16:31:00 Agreed, although the article isn't very clear on what he's referring to. Is it 'energy', or 'oil and gas', or 'industry'? But if he is referring to oil and gas, that's poor. I've said many times that Corbyn's Labour is far too moderate. 
4812 2018-12-11 16:30:57 Those phones had no coal or oil used in the energy and components to manufacture them, honest 
4813 2018-12-11 16:30:53 Bakit my johnson's baby oil sa binili mo sti @krungy21 ano purpose?
4814 2018-12-11 16:30:49 That would mean that there are a lot of people(aka individuals) in Texas who work for oil companies.

Which they do.

The word individual in that headline is critical. Of course we should NOT care that Texans donated to Beto.

#DontListenToBernieShills
4815 2018-12-11 16:30:47 I love journalism (1 of my sons is a journalist) but this is misleading- Beto took 0$ from oil & gas PACs- this was from individual employees- article says Beto "took in tons of small donations of $200 and under." 30 gave max-$2,700 Progressive employees can work at oil/gas co's!
4816 2018-12-11 16:30:45 Where you go get a oil change at? Lol I need one too
4817 2018-12-11 16:30:42 check your direct message
4818 2018-12-11 16:30:28 Right, which is why I feel like the clarification is important.  We're not exactly accustomed to oil sands project equivalent of DUCs.

4827 2018-12-11 16:30:10 Oil and oil products are not socially acceptable in many places. That's why there is an effort to get off fossil fuels and end the use of plastic. Only people without a clue as to destrutive effects of burning fossil fuels and plastics would find those products 'acceptable.'
4828 2018-12-11 16:30:09 Wow, Patriot, I really appreciate that. I use CBD oil, CBD ointment w frankincense and myrrh, and marijuana edibles to sleep. Also, sauna time and swimming help. It's like a maddening cycle...you learn to adapt by necessity. Sorry you have to go through it, too.

4831 2018-12-11 16:29:56 I've written a ton against olive oil over the years, only because I don't think it's great like everyone says, but I don't think it's terribly bad.

It's like telling people to drink wine instead of beer. It's not because wine is good for you, it's just a whole bunch less bad.
4832 2018-12-11 16:29:53 Thought I’d done well to fit a new bulb in my car myself only to realise at the same time I decided to put some oil in my car too, leaving the oil cap loose in the engine and losing it whilst driving and oil being all over my engine. Nice one
4833 2018-12-11 16:29:43 Sana oil
4834 2018-12-11 16:29:42 Probably because he made a pledge that he wouldn't take money from the gas and oil industry and then he did. And because 75% of the donations from the industry were over $200. He is the #1 recipient of oil industry cash in the House and # over all.
4835 2018-12-11 16:29:41 Oh I do that anyway..dont you worry 
4836 2018-12-11 16:29:40 Get this rubbish out of my TL, very foolish!!!

4838 2018-12-11 16:29:29 "He praised natural gas in October, calling its production “a great job opportunity and an environmentally responsible opportunity.”"

At this point, we need to move forward environmentally safe means of energy. Fracking is not that. I might burn cleaner than coal and oil..

Those three countries have wealthy owners of oil rights, and lots of jobs, dependent on those oil revenues.  Yes, they are fighting tooth and nail for their profits.

4846 2018-12-11 16:28:47 Where is Haqikatjo financial disclosure?
I thought a "reputable" Harvard graduate status would necessitate financial disclosure when debating.
But let me guess....Qatar, Saudi, or any petro oil dollars?

4852 2018-12-11 16:28:28 Hi, we're committed to using only the most sustainable sources of palm oil in our products. We have removed it wherever possible and 100% of the palm oil used in M&S products is RSPO certified.
4853 2018-12-11 16:28:26 Let’s talk about the hypocrisy of the gouvernent of Quebec when they said that Alberta oil is not socially acceptable and they will no pipeline east but we will let something else go the rivers.
4854 2018-12-11 16:28:25 How about putting the interests of the American taxpayer first Teheran, Qatar and Riyadh could fight each other all they want like they have been doing for centuries. USA should be unaligned and independent of oil imports.
4855 2018-12-11 16:28:16 Any chance you can find out why our stock exchange was shut down the minute we struck oil ?

4857 2018-12-11 16:28:02 I know it's pretty easy to forget, or just straight up annoying to take them (cod liver oil, I'm looking at you ) but honestly it makes such a difference...
Maybe try to take them one week on then one week off and not everyday how you are feeling, you'll know if it's worth it!

4861 2018-12-11 16:27:29 Coal has more than a level playing field.  The industry creates more pollution that any other energy source, yet it still can't compete against cheaper & cleaner energy sources like natural gas, wind & solar. Why don't you level the playing field for whale oil while you're at it?

4866 2018-12-11 16:27:09 These are donations from individuals, not business. Right? And with 350,000 Texans employed by the Oil and Gas industry, he should somehow find out where they work first and refuse their donations?
4867 2018-12-11 16:27:08 I’ve went through so much baby oil in the last 3 months
4868 2018-12-11 16:26:51 Don't let the facts get in your way, Silly Person. I wouldn't want to burst your bubble. By the way there is more to Canada than Alberta and oil. Without Ontario for example, equalization wouldn't even exist in Canada.
4869 2018-12-11 16:26:49 Or maybe it was because she started selling snake oil?
4870 2018-12-11 16:26:43 OK’s current budget expects $53.08 bbl. There are Oklahomans, that say, the oil is here, they will continue to drill here, but the output of a well in the Permian is as much as 4,000 BPD vs a well in SCOOP/STACK is 1,500 BPD. Where do you think the best ROI is?
4871 2018-12-11 16:26:39 like a Pez machine: There's a spring underneath a big stack of beings. In order for someone to advance, the head must be removed from the shoulders, and the next being just moves up, because it is that being's turn. So: If God is no more, man takes God's place. >>>
4872 2018-12-11 16:26:31 Dude, what did you just smoke ? The whole world knows that Saudi Arabia is an oil based country. Even Trump admitted that Salman wouldn't have survived if it wasn't for his protection. Keep your bullshit to yourself.Currency and economy are 2 different words,currency is a subset.
4873 2018-12-11 16:26:17 The money they looted was generated from somewhere,are u telling us that u ain’t generate money at all?cause the way u are just blaming PDP.our crude oil nt yet dried etc.u all accept most of this pple 3yrs ago,Amaechi etc still dwell among u.bunch of lie lie,are you holy?
4874 2018-12-11 16:26:16 So? I've lived through two or three rounds of layoffs due to ups & downs in the oil industry.  The only thing that makes those people special is that now there's a big constituency of oil industry whiners & lobbyists on social media that never existed before.
4875 2018-12-11 16:26:16 Ahh my industry destroys the planet and will end up killing us all, but I love money!
I’m so progressive.
4876 2018-12-11 16:26:11 Oil pan gasket leak. Anyone know relative cost? Labor time? Apparently I should get this fixed. Apparently my car thinks it should be around the holidays.
4877 2018-12-11 16:26:11 Also, olive oil can be like a fine wine, it's a shame to waste it in cooking.

Use it as the base of a chimichurri sauce to drizzle over steak, 

If you eat green stuff, pour away.

Can even do shots of it. Yeah, if you ever meet an OO producer you'll get to do shots of oil.
4878 2018-12-11 16:26:01 You need to reduce Petrol and Diesel price by Rs20 cutting down the benifit of oil distribution companies and excise duty by Central Government.If you do it you can win May 2019 election with comfortable margin.
Do not ignore poor people in your big vision of India
4879 2018-12-11 16:25:55 And who do you think will pay the price when the US govt taxes gas and oil companies?! The consumer! This isn’t rocket science...
4880 2018-12-11 16:25:54 You really think that when our national debts are crushing us, and the Saudis or Chinese have bought up all of our assets, that they will give a crap about native rights, or whales? They will pump that oil as fast as it will travel down those pipes, and damn the whales.

4897 2018-12-11 16:24:47 As a geologist (not one working in the oil / gas industry so no vested interest) it always amazes me how these minuscule quakes are reported as a harbinger of impending doom. They are tiny! The Richter scale is a logarithmic scale. A mag 1 is 0.00000001 of a mag 9: that's tiny!
4898 2018-12-11 16:24:44 Just trying to play some Pokémon go while I wait for my oil change and some creep rolls up “what’s up with it? What’s your name?” I kept playing on my phone ignoring him and he proceeded to call me a fucking bitch before driving off. Cool.
4899 2018-12-11 16:24:37 Actually leave is setting a piss poor example of how to promise unicorns with no idea how to buy them, ship them or pay for them.

4902 2018-12-11 16:24:14 I don’t get the confusion. Climate change is a real threat, &we all need to do our part. It takes money to take on corporations & oil companies — those who do the most harm to our climate. Justice Dems have a plan. Centrists have sat on their asses for decades. Thank you, next!
4903 2018-12-11 16:24:06 Which is ickier, the blood or the oil?
4904 2018-12-11 16:24:02 Oil be damned! 
1. Do the RIGHT thing
2. Adjust what ever necessary
4905 2018-12-11 16:24:02 And the US is no longer dependent on foreign oil! That, in itself, is huge.
4906 2018-12-11 16:24:02 New vehicles are excellent. My 5.7 Tundra runs 0W20 year round. We use to call that ‘arctic oil’ and any older engine with a bit of wear would have burned through that and seized.
4907 2018-12-11 16:24:00 Congratulations to Mayor Terry French of CBS for announcing a balanced budget with $500,000 savings. To bad he didn't think of this idea while he was a PC cabinet minister and spent our oil royalties like a drunken sailor. We won't forget Terry. #nlpoli
4908 2018-12-11 16:23:57 The continued siege of the coalition forces led to a crisis in oil derivatives, which negatively impacted the performance of media institutions and prevented many of them from continuing #اليوم_العالمي_لحقوق_الإنسان
4909 2018-12-11 16:23:50 Can you pay for my oil change ?
4910 2018-12-11 16:23:49 That’s a debate worth having. Dark or light rye? Which oil is used for the mayo? Mustard or mustard-free mayo? The combinations are endless!

On an unrelated note I’m off to lunch...
4911 2018-12-11 16:23:40 You need to reduce Petrol and Diesel price by Rs20 cutting down the benifit of oil distribution companies and excise duty by Central Government.If you do it you can win May 2019 election with comfortable margin.

4914 2018-12-11 16:23:24 Too much Oil
4915 2018-12-11 16:23:10 If worldwide oil growth is 1.2Mb each year and shale grows by a similar amount, everything should be fine. OPEC won't need to cut nor will they be able to increase. Shale may back off if too much light oil hits the market.

4920 2018-12-11 16:22:42 I think another thing that the Right generally doesn't understand is that, just because most Leftists aren't theists, doesn't mean that they fill the religion void with literal Satanism. They don't get that Leftists think of leadership >>>

4925 2018-12-11 16:22:09 Unfortunately there is no such thing as "sustainable and exploitation-free palm oil". As long as even one company makes profit from palm oil, there will always be others willing to cut down more orangutan habitat to join in on the profits.
4926 2018-12-11 16:22:04 Spend all that stupid oil money on something useful? Shipping it off to have it refined is so stupid. Oil people are stupid lazy, pull junk from land, mess up the environment and sell at huge profit. You @#$ off. Get Elon up here he knows whats up !! @elonmusk

4939 2018-12-11 16:19:59 Also, coconut oil has officially replaced my lotion. My skin STILL feels so smooth after I applied it last night. 

I know I know... I’m late to the party.
4940 2018-12-11 16:19:56 While others knew that Donald Trump is a snake oil salesman that would support policies that would not help WV (and not support stuff like the Green New Deal), Ojeda voted for him and bashed Clinton who was proposing pretty much that so yeah, miss me with Ojeda propaganda.

4962 2018-12-11 16:18:25 Also, citing PETA as a source on the benefits of eating meat is about as logical as citing BP on the safety of drilling for oil. You should cite AAAS, JAMA, Nature, PLOS, or some other reputable and independent source if you're going to make scientific claims.

4968 2018-12-11 16:17:46 One thing that I don’t like about being single is..... I have to do all the work on my car. For example put gas in it, take it to get an oil change, put air in the tires . I feel like every car should come with a nigga. Welp let me put air in my tire ... Pray for me
4969 2018-12-11 16:17:45 It has nothing to do with the oil fields and everything to do with the refineries. Most oil fields needed 60 bucks a barrel to be profitable.
4970 2018-12-11 16:17:42 The only way to end the tyranny of the Axis of Oil is to end the fossil fuel age. When demand falls and fossils pay their full cost, the markets will kill them without mercy.
4971 2018-12-11 16:17:36 Again with the lies, @AndrewScheer Your smirking lies and innuendo are unbecoming a Canadian. The Prime Minister is not in the business of importing oil from KSA. That would be Irving Oil on the east coast. #cdnpoli

4980 2018-12-11 16:16:49 I'll tell you what the world is NOT going to do and that is stop being dependent on, using fossil fuel until the last drop of oil and lump of coal is used. So what we do is simply adapt like everyone else in millennia past
4981 2018-12-11 16:16:44 ING Bank 1/2: Despite the decent drop in oil prices, we think Norway's central bank remains just about on track to raise rates twice in 2019, with the first hike coming in March. #norgesbank #norges #norway

4984 2018-12-11 16:16:32 I'm reminded of a tv advertisement from years ago for an auto oil filter. It said, "You can pay for me today or pay tomorrow".
4985 2018-12-11 16:16:30 We almost caught an angel earlier. It had 2 wings, made of oil. I never want to see it again.
4986 2018-12-11 16:16:28 I want/need some peppermint oil.
4987 2018-12-11 16:16:23 Hmm...what countries would benefit from oil and coal (scratching my head)? This should be a "Tiger and The Lady Scenario" with three doors. Behind each door is a hungry Polar Bear.
4988 2018-12-11 16:16:20 ne soyons pas trop pessimistes : le froid arrive, Noël arrive, rien de drôle à passer des journées entières sur un rond point au milieu du gas oil ... il suffit de peu de défection pour que le mouvement s'effiloche, nous y sommes presque ...

Roll the dice oil or no oil 

I’d say odds on for first target with 90% COS - hence impossible to buy now
4993 2018-12-11 16:16:03 To expand, olive oil is ok for medium-heat cooking, if you must.

It's not as toxic as "veg" oils, and is quite stable at heat comparitavely - ie, less oxidative shit etc.

But if you have sat/mono fats like lard or tallow, use that. If not, get some.

I'm from TX, my dad worked in oil, I get that building coalitions means accepting money from all types. But this is about a primary, not an election.
4998 2018-12-11 16:15:45 Actually the original statement is “there’s no social acceptability for Western oil but Quebec has no trouble accepting transfer payments” %100 true. No you don’t want to argue per capita I know that.

5005 2018-12-11 16:14:30 My point is we'll continue to exist after, as we existed before, as other places exist without oil as focus of economy & identity
It's yesterday's industry
It isn't our reason for being
Stop fighting for it like it's anything more What it is isn't what it needs to be We can adapt
5006 2018-12-11 16:14:30 #EIA STEO at the top of the hour, expect lower #natgas 1Q19 trough storage, lower OECD end of 2019 oil stocks (on lower OPEC/Non OPEC supply assumption ... they've been inched both higher monthly).
5007 2018-12-11 16:14:29 Well, we import very high amount of oil, not so in recent past we imported onions, lentils and wheat. We may be producing one or two grains in excess than what’s needed but on calories wise human intake, we are a not producing right and in enough quantities.
5008 2018-12-11 16:14:22 Fucking love changing the oil in my car.
5009 2018-12-11 16:14:14 If oil prices continue this dramatic downward trend it'll be interesting to see what the budget looks like next year. Especially with the continued growrh of the Permian.
5010 2018-12-11 16:13:58 Or droned while at a wedding, invading armies after your oil, shock & awe to prevent breaking from dollar/oil matrix. For every guerilla attack on west, for every European killed 10000 Middle Easterners die from military activity, starvation, depradation. 2 sides to this coin.
5011 2018-12-11 16:13:54 That’s your opinion! And you have every right to it. I see people employed, borders being focused on, we are not dependent on The Middle East for oil. You don’t like him and that’s ok. Just because it’s not going your way is ok too
5012 2018-12-11 16:13:51 Get urself an oil prince! I’ll be waiting for ur wedding invitation letter heuehuehehe

5023 2018-12-11 16:12:52 at the end they will stick to EU 
1. they are neighbors 
2. they have too many economy relationships with EU
3. also they want to have cheap oil and gas...
so - US can stick their Lgas and frackOil to their asses.

so - we will see...

5026 2018-12-11 16:12:40 Did you prefer the Republican party under Bush when the agenda was self-harm to advance in the Middle East for oil? You cry about Philandro Castile but ignore the thousands who died after 9/11. And hey, why not support a grandma who defend rapists and openly laugh at victims.

5036 2018-12-11 16:11:55 Great question! Oil can solidify and create blockages in both home and sewer pipes. Any food waste has the potential to clog pipes, but dumping large quantities of oil can create bigger problems, which may result in backups and home flooding.

5044 2018-12-11 16:11:24 Irving currently consumes Canadian light and synthetic oil. You clearly don't have a clue about this, so why demonstrate your ignorance?
5045 2018-12-11 16:11:24 It doesn’t. Only seizure of the oil industry will. Capitalism can’t solve this.
5046 2018-12-11 16:11:20 There are 300-400K workers in the TX oil industry, not beyond the realm of possibilities.
5047 2018-12-11 16:11:12 National Bank of Canada: While we have raised slightly our near-term $USDCAD forecasts to reflect current risk aversion, we continue to expect a #CAD appreciation by mid-2019 which would take the cross closer to 1.27. That, however, assumes a rebound in oil prices.
5048 2018-12-11 16:11:12 56% foreign oil, let that sink in. We have the second larget reserves in the world
5049 2018-12-11 16:10:56 This is not a left issue and is sure not splitting the left in the USA.  It sounds like what the GOP would do to protect their oil buddies, corporations and the rich.

5051 2018-12-11 16:10:54 Looking at the daily chart only a break of the support zone of 1.3350-60 would signal a pause in the current bullish trend otherwise with subdued oil prices & divergent central banks - unlikely at the moment #USDCAD #forex
5052 2018-12-11 16:10:28 Back in 1993, when I started working in the oil field, my father in law used to tell me: The state of Texas has enough oil to provide energy for our country for decades to come...time has proven him right !

5059 2018-12-11 16:10:00 Beto has a lot of working class donors who work in oil industries because he ran in Texas, where the wwc that Sanders supporters pretend to champion are largely working in the oil industry.
5060 2018-12-11 16:09:47 But Kate, if we just feed more oil directly *through* the fires to the coast we will have more money to deal with the fires here in Alberta, which we will totally do and not send it all to execs in Texas to buy gold-plated humvees

5068 2018-12-11 16:09:13 That's why we need the #Conservative party to make sure the #Liberals keep the tax revenue neutral. We need #Conservatives to make sure big oil companies don't get exempted. We need them to protect our fiscal concerns. Do you agree?
5069 2018-12-11 16:09:07 Obama was not the only president to keep the United States dependent on foreign oil. While at the same time price gouging the American consumers. Remember the long lines at gas stations and then being robbed once you were able to get to the pump.
5070 2018-12-11 16:09:04 Coconut oil contains lauric acid, which has many health benefits, including:

There is no smocking in federal buildings. 

I better not ...
5077 2018-12-11 16:08:24 Or we can call it his dipstick. You know, to check the oil levels.
5078 2018-12-11 16:08:23 Off the coast of Southern California, there are oil well platforms you can see. I remember seeing them driving up from Santa Monica to Santa Barbara.
5079 2018-12-11 16:08:20 Governments can direct private companies to import oil on their behalf( eg: for a strategic petroleum reserve) or for a nationalized enterprise...military or airline) Your answer is a bit disingenuous.
5080 2018-12-11 16:08:19 Saudi and other light oil would not decrease. The idiots are the simpletons who don't understand world markets or the complexity involved. It's not as simple as building a pipeline and replacing foreign oil.

5084 2018-12-11 16:07:47 There's a huge difference between small donations from rank and file employees and maximum donations from oil and gas executives, and it looks like a lot of this was the latter.

I have very even skin. Not dry and not oily so I have to be careful moisturizer. The oil has been an awesome change to my routine.
5093 2018-12-11 16:06:28 Because another Big Oil puppet took his place, same old, same old.
5094 2018-12-11 16:06:26 My auto mechanic said that he didn’t believe in oil changes.  I found a new mechanic.
5095 2018-12-11 16:06:21 Ironically my portfolio, which is oil-patch free (by my choice) is growing at 8% per year on average.
I think the investors who banked heavily on AB oil are having twitchy sphincters...
5096 2018-12-11 16:06:13 What Oil Industry. With the States new find in New Mexico/Texas that hold atleast 100 years worth of energy consumption for them their need for our oil provably dropped to zero. With no where for our Oil to go and an America that doesn't need it we have officially killed our oil.

5100 2018-12-11 16:05:49 Hey girl, I would like you about your thoughts on black seed oil.
5101 2018-12-11 16:05:45 idea was to make islam seem bad to non-muslims so people dont support jihadis if the are fighting against capitalism and new world order, and occupation of muslim  lands that have oil and gas wells or to spread coporoate and capitalist culture where its not allowed such as libya,
5102 2018-12-11 16:05:34 labour intensive industries would generate the most profit and that's not true in a few cases, like gas and oil. Hell he even points that out in Capital vol.1. I can critique Marx and defend him from bad critique while being consistent. You're critiques are bad.
5103 2018-12-11 16:05:30 Yes! And I found the cutest little sizes of everything--from Epsom salts to coconut oil... and at Walmart.
5104 2018-12-11 16:05:27 Legault is sick in the head.   Without the transfer payments Quebec would be a shithole country without western Canada profits.   No western oil in Quebec its better to pay top dollar to the arabs.NOT.
5105 2018-12-11 16:05:18 does this have to do with any of the new oil found in texas

5108 2018-12-11 16:05:09 I'm long on oil since a week. Its due to a correction especially after the OPEC cut. So. Let's hope you're right and the DOW is pushing it too.

5113 2018-12-11 16:04:27 "Today #ethanol is 25 cents less than gasoline and as much as 90 cents lower earlier this year. The past decade has shown that oil companies will actively ignore economic incentives to prevent market entry of higher ethanol blends." - @EmilySkor, CEO @GrowthEnergy
5114 2018-12-11 16:04:22 It will give them ammunition to go international and cry genocide and the world will listen to them and start to impose plethora of sanctions and embargoes. They will surely start with OIL followed by TECHNOLOGY and MEDICINE. Such action will destroy us.

Naturally I’m putting them off until last minute because I’m an adult but I’m not an adult-adult.
5118 2018-12-11 16:04:08 From every stormy wind that blows,
From every swelling tide of woes,
There is a calm, a sure retreat—
’Tis found beneath the mercy seat.

There is a place where Jesus sheds
The oil of gladness on our heads,
A place than all besides more sweet—
It is the blood-bought mercy seat.

5135 2018-12-11 16:03:16 Do you think FDR should’ve “stood by”Japan in ‘38? From dec 1937 to Jan ‘38 at Nanking the Japanese killed 300,000 people and raped 20,000 women. Yet FDR continued to sell oil and metal to Japan until July ‘41, because he thought it was in the best interest of US to do so.

Once oil from the whole plant is extracted, the small traces of THC in the oil are isolated and removed without harming the other very important cannabinoids and terpenes that naturally occur in our cannabis strain.

5169 2018-12-11 16:00:44 30 people who are working in the oil and gas industry donated  the 81K. And working in that industry does make you a "worker".

5203 2018-12-11 15:58:53 It’s funny how the US is now (finally) an exporter of oil while we have the lowest carbon emissions of any country. Sounds like the other nations need to step up to the plate. Just like other NATO allies need to pay their share, others need to cut emissions like we have.

5231 2018-12-11 15:56:49 Nigerians have an inflated sense of Nigeria's importance. If Nigeria degenerates into a failed  state, no one will care. If Nigerian oil is knocked off the market as a result, many other producers will gleefully step in and increase their revenues by filling the void.

5248 2018-12-11 15:55:44 I want to follow in my fathers footsteps and work in the oil sands as an engineer. Why are you not allowing pipelines to be built to employee future generations?
5249 2018-12-11 15:55:42 Soooooo according to the article if Alberta had no oil there would be nil for equalization payments since it’s made up of :
Personal income taxes

Business income taxes

Consumption taxes

Up to 50 percent of natural resource revenue

 Property taxes and miscellaneous
5250 2018-12-11 15:55:42 Illegalize extracting oil,  processing in certain ways and burning it

5255 2018-12-11 15:55:19 I don't believe you should use cooking oil in the machine. 
5256 2018-12-11 15:55:11 The  woman is the Subject ( the performer of the action) whereas the daughter was the one whom the action was performed upon(object) the Flogged is the verb the action performed, therefore the daughter was drunk.
5257 2018-12-11 15:55:08 ...Alternate energies exist now--solar, wind--for every important energy-using activity in our lives. The only human work that cannot be done without oil is war. -Grace Paley #BTD #amwriting #writerslife
5258 2018-12-11 15:55:08 Recession was caused by his bad economic policy.  Even in 1999 our economy was in  shamble, price of oil was $20 per barrel n Nigeria was in serious debt. OBJ didn't complain but him n Atiku put up a good economic team with sound economic policy dat help wipe out our debt
5259 2018-12-11 15:55:06 Since Texas bread and butter ( Leave the bread off for me) is Gas and Oil.. it's hard not to see him getting cash.

They have no love of this country,and help tyrannical governments in large population countries quash freedoms,for their own power and money.They have to be stopped.

5270 2018-12-11 15:53:38 US under Trump is no longer reliant on foreign oil for the 1st time in 70 years.

US under Trump is a major player in Global energy exports.

How does this help Putin/Russias economy that relies on energy exports?

Answer: It doesnt but dont let facts ruin a FAKE MEDIA narrative.

5274 2018-12-11 15:53:25 Martin's long elaborate explanation of why the MF schedule was achievable even though external consultants told him it wasn't remind me of his long elaborate explanations of why the price of oil is certain to keep increasing over the long term. #nlpoli

5276 2018-12-11 15:53:16 If, At some point in negotiations, Kirk told them that he was going to underperform the contract and they still signed him, then it’s on them. If he sold them the idea of being great (or at lest if his agent did) then their both at fault. A Snake oil salesmen is still a thief.

5279 2018-12-11 15:53:05 Have you read “Venezuela before Chavez” or “crude nation”?  They were pretty interesting. Sets out how they got to be reliant on oil. What polices Chavez introduced etc.
5280 2018-12-11 15:53:00 @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump how to end dependence on foreign oil? Have a working prototype of generator that produces enough electrical power to run a house and power itself while doing so. No combining elements, no solar, or wind, or water, or fuel required. If interested.
5281 2018-12-11 15:52:31 End Middle East exceptionalism! Less dependence on oil should make that possible. Second, only the emerge of a new political era may put en end to global right-wing populism. As the latter has reached the US, it may be overcome there (perhaps). But, don't leave us alone with it!!
5282 2018-12-11 15:52:12 That’s true. Oil is no longer a ‘scarce’ commodity. Lots of countries who can ramp up production to fill any production cuts or void.

5285 2018-12-11 15:52:05 Ha ha. Trump chose an America first policy long ago. S Arabia is just trying to catch up now that we are a massive oil producer....finally. America, winning.

5292 2018-12-11 15:51:27 It was YOUR formula (that you promised then would fix everything by letting AB keep more of its oil revenues) that was extended.

Face it #Bumbles, you were incompetent then and you're incompetent now.

5293 2018-12-11 15:51:26 It's really your way of telling the story, I swear I know what you're going through. You put clove oil. Now imagine putting a ré whole clove on the teeth. You see the lava there? Yeah, that's what I felt

5300 2018-12-11 15:50:43 I think Trump/Graham (and others) is coordinated good cop/bad cop to preserve necessary security relationship/oil & regime stability while letting politicians condemn

5302 2018-12-11 15:50:30 Have you tried cbd oil or cream. You can get some from Amazon. I heard it works wonders.
5303 2018-12-11 15:50:16 Like Biblical oil, this is the gift that keeps on giving. I didn’t realize I was following you. #TheMoreYouKnow
5304 2018-12-11 15:50:16 Still proves my point. Major oil producing nations have been sanctioned, the world went on as if nothing had happened.

5310 2018-12-11 15:50:01 The country started its decline well before that. They cut food production and relied on imports when they were living large on oil profits. Add to that the government currency control boards causing their food and medicine shortages.

5319 2018-12-11 15:49:23 There is a lot of history around oil.  Remember the Alberta slogan "Let the Eastern Bastards freeze in the dark".
Failure of prov & federal governments to ensure refining and upgrading facilities were built here, have made us dependent on foreign oil, while selling ours cheaply

5345 2018-12-11 15:46:31 Russia doesn't need to "buy" anyone's oil, it's one of the biggest exporters. The Russian oil mob is taking over Venezuelan oil assets and the deals are so terrible for Venezuela that they keep all details secret. Putin knows if #Maduro falls all illegal contracts will cancel

5352 2018-12-11 15:46:04 So this info getting out has to be people power & it will take time. I know the Left media cant bite the hands that feed them. And if the Left media donors want to do nefarious actions,work w/ corrupt police, work w/a corrupt govt etc for oil & put innocent people into jail...
5353 2018-12-11 15:45:54 1. Over 40% of Nigeria’s budget is funded with oil revenues.
2. Buhari did not put us in a recession - GEJ did. 
3. Our economy did not go into a recession under Umaru, we had enough funds in FX reserves left by OBJ, and oil prices were favourable.

5359 2018-12-11 15:44:58 Before the ban on palm oil, Okomu and Presco had always priced their goods at a premium to imported palm. Quality, specification, strong demand, and cost of doing biz in naija are reflected in that cost.

5365 2018-12-11 15:44:46 People Pray for Food, then when God gives them a fish, oil, potatoes, a Pan and fire, they get angry & leave the Kitchen! 
5366 2018-12-11 15:44:38 Side note - the way they emphasize the Jamaican-ness of the oil makes me trust it less, especially reading it in a patois accent. 
5367 2018-12-11 15:44:34 Perhaps these countries might be considered as a corruption barometer. Oil gets people very dirty.
5368 2018-12-11 15:44:17 In the 20th century, the United States endured two world wars and other traumatic and expensive military conflicts; the depression; a dozen or so recessions and financial panics; oil shocks; a flu epidemic; and the resignation of a disgraced president. Yet the Dow rose from 66 to

"Kids I want you to know that Norway is capitalist, some say it is socialist, but it can only afford its massive welfare state due to a sovereign national fund based on oil & isnt a good model for US economics"

5375 2018-12-11 15:43:29 A couple weeks ago got into a heated discussion with an oil & gas employee in Denver who didn't understand the appeal of a good bus system and other public transport. Now back in DC and can confirm, I really miss being able to reliably take a bus to work.
5376 2018-12-11 15:43:24 Oil and gas industry is big in Texas.  Is the nature of business one works for now necessary qualification for individual party contribution?  Who can tell if an individual did not contribute to more than one candidate?  Or indeed, why not?
5377 2018-12-11 15:43:19 Is that almond or olive oil ?

5383 2018-12-11 15:42:39 Unfair to target palm oil companies, particularly Okomu. Expansion of capacity and production is a function of many variables. A major variable is land acquisition. Another is time. Okomu has increased its land bank and is planting. It takes 4-6 yrs from seed to mature tree.
5384 2018-12-11 15:42:24 They even think they have the right to dictate which job is acceptable before you can donate to a campaign. Work in the oil/gas industry, they don't want your money. These people are ridiculous. I really don't need a bunch of angry white dudes to tell us what is acceptable.
5385 2018-12-11 15:42:20 I’m convinced baby oil makes anything look good cus I just saw myself in the mirror & Wheew my ugly self was lookin a little too good

5387 2018-12-11 15:42:13 @BNNBloomberg @paulbagnellBNN I would have to disagree with ur guest this morning that said "the oil differential is affecting all Canadians and we should be outraged." Where was your guests for the past 3 yrs of high gas prices compared to the price of oil?

5399 2018-12-11 15:41:43 I followed a few trends when I was younger and they fucked me up lol. For example I started using coconut oil on my face and shit didn’t go good
5400 2018-12-11 15:41:37 There’s a pants on head idea that you can use their lies against them. Never works, but I guess it’s got the kind of zest normally reserved for Vinyard bridge sniping and somehow that counts
5401 2018-12-11 15:41:36 Getting an oil change and my mechanic just said hey will you help me with something ? Then proceeds to hand me a spliff I lost a week ago and say “just kidding, I’m helping you today” hahahahHA wow ok love u mike

5405 2018-12-11 15:41:05 So how will the government cover the shortfall in the budget with the now plummeting oil prices (budget was based on USD70). A little reckless, no? Actually no, it’s extremely bad policy-ing. @guanenglim @tonypua
5406 2018-12-11 15:41:05 For the first time in 75 years America isn’t dependent on foreign oil

5409 2018-12-11 15:40:51 Black tea is the tea with more caffeine, I just prefer the green because it does not have this "pump" effect.

Salt moderately is ok, but high amounts can increase blood pressure.

Olive oil is a better general choice.

Dark chocolate is great for libido, mood and cholesterol.

5416 2018-12-11 15:40:18 Your pessimism is in a class of its own :) But few points: Libya barely had any western oil company pre Gaddafi’s death, Venezuela literally sent everyone packing, replacing western companies with national. If we keep American oil companies happy, maybe, someone will care :)

5432 2018-12-11 15:39:22 i was supposed to get an oil change over 2,000 miles ago 
5433 2018-12-11 15:39:17 Who knew that Enron’s lobbyists would ask to make it legal to screw you guys over on prices  Or that yall’d agree
5434 2018-12-11 15:39:17 You'll Never Guess What Happened After We Tried Soy Frankincense Oil For Toxic Mold
5435 2018-12-11 15:39:11 'The Institute for Energy Research pointed Wednesday to data from the Congressional Research Service showing that the shares of crude oil and natural gas produced on federal lands dropped from 2009 to 2017 even as production on non-federal lands “skyrocketed.”'
5436 2018-12-11 15:38:59 We don’t want your oil . Move in to the future. Greedy bastards. And you will harm marine life with your spills .
5437 2018-12-11 15:38:56 "They dont make men like my granddaddy no more" 

Ya granddad was verbally abusive and an alcoholic. He changed the oil on your grandma car though so I guess?
5438 2018-12-11 15:38:45 I had plans to get remote start and tinted windows but God had other plans for me like get all new tires, new brakes and now I need an oil change and a new car battery  #happyholidays

5444 2018-12-11 15:38:22 All three togueter are the grater oil producer of the world. So is obvious the reasons behind it...
5445 2018-12-11 15:38:21 Aboniki my bro
5446 2018-12-11 15:38:12 The motive is simple: oil profits.
5447 2018-12-11 15:38:09 That is a reasonable suggestion.

But please tell your @CBCNews @TorontoStar & @globeandmail friends in Toronto that global oil & gas demand continues to grow dramatically, & that their notion of pot as a driver of the Canadian economy is infantile.

5453 2018-12-11 15:37:31 Evolution and creation are like oil and water. They will never mix regardless of how much you might try. Those that try to believe both are seriously confused and no better than blind guides.Both teachings are incompatible and offer divergent explanations for the origins of life.

5464 2018-12-11 15:36:18 Affiliations have got nothing to do with it if we had voted yes last time we would be in the shit the referendum was faught by the snp on oil money a few weeks after the vote the downtown in the industry happened and you snp supporters have a cheek talking about propaganda

5466 2018-12-11 15:36:09 If you can convert Kerogen in the shales into oil&gas which is what the 2nd shale revolution will be about then the US possible oil reserves could be as high as 45 trillion barrells, the only problem is that producir the 18Mbbl/day it consumes would require 180GW of power

5482 2018-12-11 15:34:18 Lmao yes. Oil literally goes through your engine to lubricate and cool the metal. Your shit can lock up and the car is unusable, and it’ll cost more to fix than the car is worth probably

5491 2018-12-11 15:33:25 Yes, I understand CAPP has long argued for the development of foreign oil at the expense of Canadian supply.

5513 2018-12-11 15:31:44 resource revenues like oil and gas and hydropower are counted 50%.

5522 2018-12-11 15:31:07 He already has taken the credit.
Mr. Obama told the audience at a gala for Rice University’s Baker Institute,
“That whole — suddenly America’s like the biggest oil producer and the biggest gas — that was me, people.”
5523 2018-12-11 15:31:01 Had to get the oil change yesterday  80$ smh
5524 2018-12-11 15:30:50 We never have been dependent on foreign oil, it was just a cheaper option at the time as US stocks cost more to extract. Due to new means of extraction such as fracking and polluting the Gulf, the prices have equalized. What that has to do with Trump is irrelevant,stupid news!!

5610 2018-12-11 15:24:07 1. Please stop the panic buying of petrol, there is no scarcity happening.  The FG controls the market and will keep the oil afloat. I mean, who would want to hurt the masses in an election period?
5611 2018-12-11 15:24:00 @TunjiAndrews disagree
1. Crisis will cause oil prices to go up
2. The West African region would go up in flames
3. Islamic Extremist would have a safe haven

5645 2018-12-11 15:21:06 What I've said doesn't even touch the sides, it's way more complex than just belief & oil prices.

5663 2018-12-11 15:19:05 お、いる…ッッ(パタリ
5664 2018-12-11 15:19:01 The worthlessness was determined by external forces, not internal. Internal productivity hadn't varied in any significant way, the nation was heavily dependent on oil wealth & oil prices took a dive, this in combination with other factors, resulted in diminished belief
5665 2018-12-11 15:18:56 I am, I'm being satirical towards environmentalist hypocrites that have no issues about outsourcing oil labor to nations that don't regulate environmental protection
5666 2018-12-11 15:18:56 . @Valvoline missing or loose and they checked my car and said my sensors must be faulty. At the Volvo dealer and found out your team forgot to put my oil cap back so now my engine needs to be cleaned and spark plugs replaced. $400 in the hole because of your error...
5667 2018-12-11 15:18:55 no matter how much lotion, coconut oil, vaseline etc. I put on my hands I’ll still be ashy. 
5668 2018-12-11 15:18:52 Yg aku baca itu yg boleh dipake double clensing. Kalo bisa cleansing step 1 nya tu yg bahan2nya natural kaya olive oil gitu. Terus habisnya pake fw. Sunscreen wajib pakai. Sama serum optional sih, bisa pake bisa engga. Nyesuaiin sama kondisi kulit ajaa, kalo butuh ya pake serum.
5669 2018-12-11 15:18:48 Hello @FreshDirect. Disastrous delivery this morning. Shattered olive oil bottle took an hour to clean up. Leaked out of bag on my wood floor & ruined the kitchen rug. No choice but to throw away the glass coated pet food. Need to rethink your tote bag on fragile items. 
5670 2018-12-11 15:18:48 No BJP lost becuase 1 squeezing middle class by taxing 2 ignoring farmers 3 putting high cess on oil
5671 2018-12-11 15:18:47 if he gave back all the oil and gas money, even the "small" donations, he would still have 99.5% of his original total

so why would he keep that money?
5672 2018-12-11 15:18:41 I'll get the train ready!!

Did you try your oil today?
5673 2018-12-11 15:18:41 Seperation is becoming a real discussion point. If it happens you will see how strong Alberts is when the rest of Canada has to buy oil in USD and is broke...

5676 2018-12-11 15:18:18 What's he really saying: I ignored the importance of this monument because I'm getting paid by oil and gas industries. Screw the environment and future generations, I'm getting my money.
5677 2018-12-11 15:18:18 Add an oil change!

5680 2018-12-11 15:17:48 Don’t worry Miguel, I won’t forget that when there was only enough oil to last one day you used your eelectricity to keep it burning for eight! Happy (late) Chanukah you funky little knifefish!
5681 2018-12-11 15:17:47 (From yesterday) It’s preferable to burn the leftover oil and wicks. If it’s too difficult then wrap them up and dispose of them
5682 2018-12-11 15:17:47 How I choose to answer your questions is my affair. And no, we don't have to stop buying oil, but that's a straw argument anyway. This is about our response, or lack thereof.
5683 2018-12-11 15:17:45 You don't make edibles by putting crushed weed into the muffin mix.  There's a whole process of extracting the oil from the weed, then using that to bake that optimises the potency of the edible.
5684 2018-12-11 15:17:43 This is a bullshit article. I am a native Texan and got no where close to voting for Robert. He is a snake oil salesman who can fool the weak minded.
5685 2018-12-11 15:17:42 It’s annoying to me when guys don’t wear any type of oil or cologne lol
5686 2018-12-11 15:17:40 This is a stupid statistic. Beto is from Texas, so it makes perfect sense his donors are in the oil and gas business. If he was from Wisconsin, that would be significant.
5687 2018-12-11 15:17:37 Had a real problem with squirrels climbing on bird feeder eating all the bird food but I found a solution..Vegetable oil all over the rod the feeder is attatched to. I have to say I’m quite enjoyng the desperate futile acrobatic attempts they’re making to hang on.
5688 2018-12-11 15:17:35 Sadly our timing for discovering oil let the whole country down, it’s so painful that the nation never healed from the mistakes then and we are still bearing the brunt till this day
5689 2018-12-11 15:17:35 I’m good at giving booty rubs add a little baby oil and make booty smooth 
5690 2018-12-11 15:17:25 So America should invade Saudi Arabia and take their oil instead of buying it?
5691 2018-12-11 15:17:22 1/2 In November, Swiss NGO Public Eye released report alleging that #Switzerland's second largest company #Vitol, which was already responsible for marketing 25% of Kazakh #oil exports in 2014, apparently gained access to strategically important oil fields in #Kazakhstan.
5692 2018-12-11 15:17:22 Can someone who drinks kombucha tell me which essential oil will help me get a girlfriend?
5693 2018-12-11 15:17:15 How often do you actually get an oil change?
5694 2018-12-11 15:17:01 pelembab, face oil, double cleansing.
5695 2018-12-11 15:16:58 Dow soars 350 points, or 1.4%, on hopes for progress on the US-China trade war. Nasdaq leaps 1.4%, while the S&P 500 jumps 1.3%. US oil prices climb 2.2% to $52.15 a barrel, clawing back a chunk of Monday’s slide.
5696 2018-12-11 15:16:57 Dear God, your children are rubbing groundnut oil on their faces and are captioning it sun kiss. Are you happy with this?

5701 2018-12-11 15:16:32 Hey @Valvoline...went to have my oil changed at your Polaris location 2 weeks ago and after they started the service realized they didn’t have a filter for my Volvo. I left and my engine light came on so I decided 2 go back and have them double check that nothing was (1/3)
5702 2018-12-11 15:16:23 So they pouring motor oil on that bacon in the Wendy’s commercial?
5703 2018-12-11 15:16:22 TOTH: NATGAS 1H follows thru lower, 4.232=supt lower.

SPX 1D huge gap up on open, "neutral channel trade" is here.
5704 2018-12-11 15:16:17 And by the worship of Big Money.  The U.S. joining Russian oligarchs and oil rich countries just to satisfy bank accounts is a global disgrace.  It's no wonder the rest of the world is laughing at us.
5705 2018-12-11 15:16:17 We are in debt because we borrow oil and silk from other countries but when we try to pay them back they won't take our American money

5709 2018-12-11 15:16:08 207 สวยค่ะ
5710 2018-12-11 15:16:07 it's just best to buy your own oil and get somebody you know to do your oil change for you or do it yourself... i got put on game these places aint gone keep finessin me lol
5711 2018-12-11 15:16:06 My eyes have really bad reaction to (cat hair/cat saliva/cat oil? no idea which yet) so I'm trying to keep them out of my space
5712 2018-12-11 15:16:04

5713 2018-12-11 15:16:03 And it smells so good! I showered my body in that oil. And when I have the next one that’s what I’m using again. From DR they have the pure oil.
5714 2018-12-11 15:15:58 Coconut oil saved mine! I had really badly damaged hair, had a slight trim and then religiously use coconut oil and a coconut oil conditioner spray from Palmers, helps stop tangling so brushing is more gentle!
5715 2018-12-11 15:15:53 Read up on solar and wind power. Prices already competitive and when oil and gas prices go up it will be mire so. We can not just leave the people who work in gas and oil behind. In Oklahoma it is all they got. That needs attention.
5716 2018-12-11 15:15:53 Green Tea instead of Coffee.

Butter instead of Margarine.

Pepper instead of Salt.

Olive Oil instead of Sunflower Oil.

Mustard instead of Mayonnaise.

Dark Choc instead of Milk Choc.

Rice Milk instead of Cow's Milk.

Nuts instead of Candies.

Small changes, Big consequences.

5718 2018-12-11 15:15:34 Yes I would consider Mink Oil essential.

5721 2018-12-11 15:15:13 Sitting waiting to get my oil changed listening to customer after customer be rude to the guys here for no reason. It’s the holidays people be kind to people even if you are paying them@for a service it doesn’t mean you get to treat them like garbage #Christmas
5722 2018-12-11 15:15:08 GOOD FATS: Avocado, Fish, Almonds, Walnuts, Peanuts, Cashews, Olive Oil, Coconut Oil, Seeds, Coconut, Olives, Peanut Butter, Low-Fat Dairy
5723 2018-12-11 15:15:05 Don’t worry; oil stocks will shine again; the tax loss selling will end soon and the sentiment will turn positive. Technically we need some sideway movement and after that stocks will starts to perform
5724 2018-12-11 15:14:56 If you've got so much of the stuff, why *are* you importing oil at all?
5725 2018-12-11 15:14:51 Does anyone remember when caramel wasn’t salted and oils were not essential? As long as you don’t put essential oil in your salted caramel. You don’t want essentially salted caramel oil and would likely taste unessential.
5726 2018-12-11 15:14:47 @tisanb does your feet smell like hot oil

5732 2018-12-11 15:14:27 I ran out. I’m getting more when I land to complete the trifecta. I put on a layer of Cetaphil, then a layer of shea butter, then a layer of coconut oil.
5733 2018-12-11 15:14:21 Wanted to say a very heartfelt Thank you to Arcas & Ember for the wonderful holiday gift bag they gave me filled with all sorts of treats! Wearing some of the sandalwood beard oil but what I will treasure most is the signed portrait of Kenai bear by Arcas!
5734 2018-12-11 15:14:11 @joececiyyc you’ve finally figured out you need oil $ to pay the bills...finally the penny has dropped!
Guess what many others of us need oil $ to pay our bills too!
5735 2018-12-11 15:14:08 But 2018 was a year of competing theses, and both end up looking like they are right - yes, prices were higher than shale band proponents expected, and yet fundamentals suggest that oil bulls missed something as well. So hoping to learn from the experience of others
5736 2018-12-11 15:14:00 With all the oil here in usa, good deal. ND has alot
5737 2018-12-11 15:13:58 yeah he was saying something about like the cost of oil a quart and how these places be having all these deals on oil changes so it's like how they making money? so they be back there doing stuff they shouldn't so you have a reason to come back.. so now he do mine!
5738 2018-12-11 15:13:57 A weighted blanket, new oil diffuser and lots of soy candles, for sure.
5739 2018-12-11 15:13:43 I am not yet convinced the  Crude Oil supply cut will be effective in warding off a repeat of 2014, when rapidly rising global production overtook growth in demand and led to a huge overhang of unwanted fuel.

5746 2018-12-11 15:12:58 One of my funniest mistakes to be caught during copy editing...it's tung oil, not tongue oil.
5747 2018-12-11 15:12:57 "Canada" doesn't buy oil, oil companies do. In particular Irving Oil and they would continue to do so even with energy east. That's capitalism but government.

5749 2018-12-11 15:12:46 There is NO evidence of China wanting AB bitumen. No contracts, no potential interest. When asked for clarity on the matter, the snake oil salesmen say they are looking for a foreign market but do not have one as yet.

5758 2018-12-11 15:12:20 “starting to be concerned”?? Are their pockets not full enough from tax breaks, selling public land, kickbacks from coal, oil, and pharmaceutical industries? They are impervious to scorn. They feel no shame, no responsibility.

5793 2018-12-11 15:08:55 1 shredded rotisserie chicken breast, 2/3 cup jasmine rice, frozen peas, green or white onion, 1 egg, 1/3 tbs sesame oil, 1 tbs LS soy sauce, a lil bit of powder garlic + salt and pepper to taste. Sofries peas, onions y egg en el oil y luego agregas todo lo demas y revuelves. 
5794 2018-12-11 15:08:53 So MBS is getting away w murder. Oil and lobbyists are more important.
5795 2018-12-11 15:08:49 Sneaky Frenchies, don't like oil and gas but happy to take oil and gas money. What hypocrisy.
5796 2018-12-11 15:08:42 I use a homemade chest rub when my son gets a cough/congestion. I make it with half cup coconut oil, 4 drops of eucalyptus and 3 drops of lavender essential oils. (I use doterra brand oils and they also makes a breath blend that I sometimes add). Hope he feels better soon.
5797 2018-12-11 15:08:36 It wasn't just the oil industry. Venezuela has socialized more then 500 companies. For comparison Argentina has like 50+.

They seized GM plants, agribusiness, anything not "fair", and ruined them all.
5798 2018-12-11 15:08:26 Best Bud - I’ve been waiting to purchase CBD oil from YaAll. When will you be in production? Need some !

5804 2018-12-11 15:07:50 Its realistic , but its not required as u can easily fly between these destination in a lesser time, as far as oil and water is concerned, pipeline should be made.

5808 2018-12-11 15:07:30 Or, I can choose to not tarnish an individual who lives in a state where oil is a huge part of the economy & yet still received so little from them. Why do this? Because your guy winning is this important that you'll burn the rest of the field down? If Beto wins, i vote for him.

5810 2018-12-11 15:07:26 This hurts the oil companies (especially the domestic ones) more than it will ever hurt $TSLA.

The oil price, above which EVs take market share, below which is unprofitable, is converging on a world of hurt.

That's called getting caught between a rock and hard place.
5811 2018-12-11 15:07:23 are earthquake shelters made from oil and gas?
5812 2018-12-11 15:07:17 ohh and our US Military guards and protects all the Saudi oil that is shipped globally...go figure that..
5813 2018-12-11 15:07:16 I'm gone make it with some Shittake & Crimini mushrooms orange &  red bell peppers, probably just a lil squash tomato garlic basil olive oil combo
5814 2018-12-11 15:07:13 Shoutout to y’all Panthers fans that have way more optimism than me right now. I hope we can slide in the playoffs, I really do. But it’s gonna take a LOT. I hope Cam Newton’s grandma is praying over this team right now and anointing each player individually with oil.
5815 2018-12-11 15:07:12 The Big Oil Challenge will destroy them all.  That money is why they’re in politics.
5816 2018-12-11 15:07:09 Yes. Now that I know what it was anxiety and not a heart attack. Treating with low dose antidepressant and anti anxiety when needed. Also trying CBD oil.
5817 2018-12-11 15:07:05 Oh, I'm sorry. Wall actually had a great solution. Instead of excluding all non-renewable resource revenues (the once Harper/Wall/Calvert answer which was kinda stupid) include hydro revenues  in the formula (which aren't as much oil).
That would somewhat balance off Quebec.
5818 2018-12-11 15:06:50 Every industries subsidized. If you took away subsidies from oil and gas more than 50% of companies would be unprofitable.

5822 2018-12-11 15:06:39 @KentEhrhardt there’s a bug going around. Coughed Saturday, lost my voice Sunday. Slowly coming back today, lots of tea from @younglivingeo Thieves essential oil helps. Hope you get better quick!
5823 2018-12-11 15:06:39 yeah maybe. if the market doesn't collapse by then. (it still has the highest CO2 upstream of any oil and will still have very high sulphur content...)
5824 2018-12-11 15:06:24 lets see, i dug around in my folder of recipe links and grabbed this one - i dont get all weird w/ the brown sugar for the sauce, I just stick w/ hoisin, soy, and sesame oil.

I also use spaghetti noodles, they are cheap and work fine.  I never use non-stick cookware, either..
5825 2018-12-11 15:06:23 Niger Delta should come up with their security plans beyond 2019. If not Biafra and the rest would turn Niger delta a battle ground due the oil. We should avoid Biafra war experience in 1967. The situation is this Country is fearsome to say.
5826 2018-12-11 15:06:18 Quebec’s Legault is a fool!  Oil piped to New Brunswick would raise profits for Cdn oil, create mega employment, and he forgets those huge transfer payments Quebec gets from western oil profits without which Quebec would be a crap hole!  Wake up FOOL!

5828 2018-12-11 15:06:02 Statements of fact are not 'prejudiced', smart guy, they are literally just statements of fact.  For example, if I called everyone east of Saskatchewan a mostly useless welfare rat that couldn't survive without Alberta oil money, that's a statement of fact, not a prejudice.

5830 2018-12-11 15:05:48 Nah, since it's the NRA, gun oil would be a fitting lubrication. Lots and lots of gun oil.
5831 2018-12-11 15:05:42 Maybe if we weren’t overtaxed already. 

Lol at you if you believe the @liberal_party will keep the tax “revenue neutral.”

Hey, why did major emitter SHELL get a carbon tax exemption? Will any small business get an exemption? No wonder the oil companies are on board!

We give the Saudis weapons and they are causing the largest famine in history!!!! oh and none of the Iranians 9/11
5835 2018-12-11 15:05:18 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
5836 2018-12-11 15:05:17 Yes, there is oil here. But we , meaning Alberta AND Canada, need to get access to market for the products. Our customer has become our vicious competitor. Both Canada and Alberta are being ripped off by the current situation. #ableg #cdnpoli

5844 2018-12-11 15:04:36 Holy hell! JT imports oil from —— anywhere? What does he do with it, store it in the basement of 24 Sussex? Mind blowing!
5845 2018-12-11 15:04:28 I was always mad on all Africans including myself specially the leaders for having such a fruitful land but to still have this much hunger and homelessness but to actually have all that cash money and oil  & to see any Arab without food and a shelter is just a disgrace 
5846 2018-12-11 15:04:22 So when I was pregnant There’s is this oil that is mostly used for babies there an honest brand. It helps with congestion and etc. You can also use tylenol & benadryl. The humidifer works wonders.Hope this helped.
5847 2018-12-11 15:04:17 Rex Tillerson is, I feel sure, a good man. He served our @POTUS and the
country for a brief period of time. He made a fortune in the OIL biz...all of
that said, he is now being used by the left to plant seeds of doubt about
our President....to bring his numbers of support down.
5848 2018-12-11 15:04:16 I've avoided eating milk chocolate for months as an experiment because it makes me feel unwell, I had a small bar of @greenblacksUS dark chocolate with a praline centre today...  only to discover it contain palm oil and that's what makes me feel unwell. 
5849 2018-12-11 15:04:14 Which sounds weak, because the basics are so simple (burning oil=climate change). But it's easy to lose confidence in the face of brazen counter arguments, quoting statistics etc that you might not be familiar with.
5850 2018-12-11 15:04:11 Thanks to the pro-energy policies of President Trump, the United States is now a net oil exporter for the first time in 75 years. 

Energy independence plays a crucial role in putting America First! #KAG #PowerTheFuture

5855 2018-12-11 15:03:40 1. Can't be done in 3-4 months, oil have high share in state revenue.
2. Benami if they have to do, they wld hve done it till now. But remember, highest donation getting party.
3. 1 thng, they wld hve dne tll nw, bt Congress hve Vayapam, Lalit modi , Panama paper (Raman singh) nw
5856 2018-12-11 15:03:37 by refusing PAC money he is by nature accepting money from individuals not industries. one more time, I'm talking about MAXIMUM ALLOWED donations from OIL&GAS *EXECUTIVES,* not small donations from employees
5857 2018-12-11 15:03:34 It seems like it’s too cheap to be true. But it works and they have a rose oil that hits as well. My shit look like I got highlighter on all the time now.

5860 2018-12-11 15:03:05 Your money you meaning oil ?  4 nations taxes built all that Scotland couldn’t afford a barrel and most the whisky is owned by English companies same as Guinness.
5861 2018-12-11 15:03:01 To add some flavor to your greens, sauté spinach and kale in olive oil &amp; fresh squeezed orange &amp; lemon juice. Serve with berries &amp; chicken.
5862 2018-12-11 15:02:53 Wish I was joking but I know people that swear cannabis oil cures everything.
5863 2018-12-11 15:02:42 I put some olive oil in my hair last night with the conditioner  my hair so damn soft omg! I can’t wait to straighten it 
5864 2018-12-11 15:02:42 I'm just looking for a better alternative. I never saw "Deforestation free" palm oil on any product. So I will just cook christmas cookies myself with regular butter.
5865 2018-12-11 15:02:29 Everyone with half a brain knows accelerated warming is happening..and carbon caused. it’s just that their disdain will not allow them to admit it to the “libs”....or they are in the oil/gas business.  Identity politics is geared towards suckers.  Ask Jim Jones

5868 2018-12-11 15:02:06 Lucozade boost is the real equivalent to drinking engine oil. You must really be a mechanic.
5869 2018-12-11 15:02:06 And palm oil...I've never had whatever Zambian rice is and nor have I had jollof without the spices and palm oil.
5870 2018-12-11 15:02:04 They're sitting on oil

They have a HUGE economic competitive advantage over every other province with a 0% PST.

They STILL can't make it work.

But it's Canada's fault.

#Eyeroll
5871 2018-12-11 15:01:59 Think the recent numbers going about have mislead many because they don’t count services nor intra-U.K. trade. Scottish government figures show both - but not oil and gas exports.
5872 2018-12-11 15:01:59 Mexican oil is produced by a corrupt and inefficient state run corporation. 
Another example of competition giving us better and cheaper products. 
Just say no to Socialism.
5873 2018-12-11 15:01:54 So...Beto, in *Texas*, got ~.5% of his donations from individuals who worked in oil/gas. Bernie, in Vermont (is there oil in VT?) got ~.1% of his from the same group. In your mind, that makes Beto look bad and Bernie look good? (And what % is acceptable? Whatever Bernie says?)
5874 2018-12-11 15:01:54 Imp Californian please. I know it'll break and leak oil all over the place but I just like them!

5880 2018-12-11 15:01:43 As coal, gas & oil run out in the next 30-50yrs & the price of fossil fuels skyrockets what happens to those power stations & countries that haven't prepared for the future beyond 2050? Short term thinking is dangerous for next generations on  #skynews
5881 2018-12-11 15:01:39 And they do sooooo much good with that oil wealth for their own people... I feel for these countries when the oil runs dry... which it will. Oh yeah... it will. That’s why Bone Saw is trying to get his economic forum off the ground. But that just “ground” to a half after Jamal k.
5882 2018-12-11 15:01:29 FYI: Ports in NFLD, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Quebec receive oil tankers up to ULCC size (550,000 DWT) on a regular basis. Most tankers off BC are max 120,000 DWT. Thus, the tankers serving east coast ports are often four times larger that those serving west coast ports.
5883 2018-12-11 15:01:26 Well, well, OIL!

5886 2018-12-11 15:01:13 Is that make up on your face or red oil?
5887 2018-12-11 15:01:08 We’re also going to hire 5,000 more Border Patrol agents, and don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
5888 2018-12-11 15:00:57 The last oil change I got was $90. 

Never again.
5889 2018-12-11 15:00:53 Want to make your own all-purpose cleaner? Combine 4 tablespoons baking soda and 1 quart warm water, 4 drops essential oil, and 2 drops of dishwashing liquid, and use it with a sponge to wipe messes away!
5890 2018-12-11 15:00:51 We were the model for the world.  A highly regulated and high tech oil and gas industry adapting continually to meet the needs of our country and the world.  The highest safety standards for such an industry.  As well as that industry helping to finance the entire nation. Whoops
5891 2018-12-11 15:00:48 If we’re down to worrying about Hunter’s drum, things must really be turning around for the Oil. Crowd will really get back to being one of the best when they allow themselves to trust what they are seeing is a competent club that is not going to kick them in the balls

He has already aloud oil drilling off our coast & in our Parks & our protected lands & he is not doing anything about climate change. If you don't see it you eyes are closed he is trying to destroy America.

5923 2018-12-11 14:58:21 You shout that again because you are among the lucky ones. In the ghetto 6/=will get you a spoon of salt,a spoon of sugar and a spoon of cooking oil.Thank God sister and when you are done Thank Him again.
5924 2018-12-11 14:58:13 In all fairness the news is never really right when it comes to predicting the future weather thats economics or world war 3 after Brexit vote. Last time the SNP worked out Scottish wealth they said they would sell oil at $110 a barrel. Three days later oil was $48 a barrel  
5925 2018-12-11 14:58:12 Amerudi kwenye oil & gas

5928 2018-12-11 14:58:00 clove oil is so shitty
5929 2018-12-11 14:57:58 The problem is that was true across all media: print, broadcast. All faithfully repeated the mantra: new oil is good. It was BP/PR 100%
5930 2018-12-11 14:57:56 Oh that’s too easy! 1 genuine motorcraft oil filter!
5931 2018-12-11 14:57:46 “You hear .. excuses for why we can’t get this done, but the truth is : the barriers are political. Our gov't has been captured by billionaire fossil fuel execs who will burn the planet & destroy our society for the sake of making another billion dollars pumping and selling oil.”

5935 2018-12-11 14:57:27 The very next day - Singapore bans truffle oil
5936 2018-12-11 14:57:17 Until he got killed the average American had no idea who he was. Now he is cause for going to war with the largest oil producer in the world?
5937 2018-12-11 14:57:09 time to suck the last bit of oil out of my pen bc i’m broke and have no pen rip
5938 2018-12-11 14:56:52 All Religion is a Form of Madness! Makes me mad! The electric car was killed by Walt Disney! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
5939 2018-12-11 14:56:45 Why don't you care that a faulty construction company stole $36,000 from me and now I have no oil?   Please send me any donation it will help my homeless and me for the winter especially!  dymersky@yahoo.com
5940 2018-12-11 14:56:42 Cheers sweets x 
Do you just use the oil after you apply the cream?
5941 2018-12-11 14:56:42 CBD oil.
5942 2018-12-11 14:56:33 You clearly don’t know why oil prices dropped. China was in high demand of oil. Around 2014 that demand decreased and the US increased oil production and fracking. It doesn’t matter how much oil they can produce if other countries can just drill their own cheaper.
5943 2018-12-11 14:56:28 we're in oil/gas engineering - just passed this along to our BD lady - thanks!!!

5945 2018-12-11 14:56:15 It is very relevant. He said it was a better way. He supported the policies that crippled the country. The policies that caused brain drain, goods shortages, hyper inflation, increases in poverty and border line starvation. All in a country with huge oil wealth.
5946 2018-12-11 14:56:07 Yes, I also love the lightness. Which oil do you like? Olive?
5947 2018-12-11 14:56:04 While their at it STOP killing protected whales and the ocean itself you scourge on the eco system have fun finding your own water n oil !!!!
5948 2018-12-11 14:56:02 You talking about the same fencing that’s been going up for probably a decade now or longer? What about the beautiful concrete wall mexico was paying for? Hmmm snake oil.
5949 2018-12-11 14:55:43 ふわたん 泣いてるわぁ～
5950 2018-12-11 14:55:33 Donations from oil/energy often include a) alt energy (bc oil cos are investing heavily there) b) people who clean up the mess left by oil cos & c) people who are performing necessary roles like regulation, safety inspection etc. Pretty sure David knows this though.
5951 2018-12-11 14:55:20 They benefit greatly.  They want to shut down the oil industry.  Without it there is no high paying jobs, the corporate taxes gets slashed the resource revenue zero.  With all that the equalization calc doesn’t skew to Quebec anymore.  Sask/ab/NL all become poorer than Qc
5952 2018-12-11 14:55:18 And what a manel it was. In one breath he was telling us what wonderful work the US was doing leading on climate change, before proudly announcing the US as the world's top oil & gas producer. Sigh.
5953 2018-12-11 14:55:16 Twin Cities media loves painting Zimmer as a hardworking, gritty genius and PJ Fleck as a snake oil salesman. I will never understand why.
5954 2018-12-11 14:55:14 HRC?? lol okay, anyways..you don't know who he returned the 200K to but don't care, and the fact that these 25 exec's sent a total of 20k through actblue is enough to say Beto is owned by oil and gas. Got it 
5955 2018-12-11 14:55:11 Mrs. Notley, we need you to take a tougher stance with the PM. We need to halt all transfer payments to Ottawa and you need to educate central Canada on our ethical oil versus their unethical oil.
5956 2018-12-11 14:55:07 Cant u see the media is only making it appear like shes fucking up by obsucating, smearing and idignant ridicule? Its a classic done to every progressive yet republicans and dems who want more war and oil money are fine
5957 2018-12-11 14:55:07 Suncor = wholly owned subsid of Sun Oil = not "Canadian" in any sense of word, other than hvng operations in Cda.  CNR shows a majority (67%) of its stock is owned by institutional investors, and four out of the top five are AMERICAN.  Don't I just WHAT when facts are presented?
5958 2018-12-11 14:55:03 With the EPA fixing to change water protection rules the wetlands will be destroyed. Wetlands protect Louisiana residents from storm surge. Loss of wetlands already has cost coastal states billions. Time to hold oil companies responsible not give them more freedom to destroy
5959 2018-12-11 14:54:55 I’ve found that if you put extra virgin olive oil on your kale it makes it slide of your plate into the trash can much easier.

5963 2018-12-11 14:54:34 Once again, @Jkenny shows he doesn't understand transfer payments and he doesn't understand Canada or Canadians.  Just American Oil Execs.
5964 2018-12-11 14:54:33 Washington in Bed with Rich Muslims. It's all about the oil. Which is worse, the American Government or Saudi Arabia? #bumsinwashington

5973 2018-12-11 14:53:49 Turism is nothing compared to oil and gas industry (believe me, I am oil engineer), extracting or refining are just as bad. Especially the marine exploitations (platforms) and the hydraulic fracturing (terrestrial). Mining is poisoning the nature, gold mining  uses cyanids.
5974 2018-12-11 14:53:46 USA has had a lot of oil but just haven’t used those. They are very smart.
5975 2018-12-11 14:53:42 The squeaky wheel gets the oil
5976 2018-12-11 14:53:36 You say myth I say economic principle of supply and demand. In the us we are lowering co2 by switching to natural gas power production. This is more efficient because it has no spin up rate, and the emissions are 60% less than coal and oil which are nearly the same.
5977 2018-12-11 14:53:35 THE results are absolute shocker for the BJP.The Congress set the cat among the pigeons.The BJP lose Rajasthan,Chattisgarh an old fort them and an evenly poised ongoing contest between BJP and Congress.The reasons why BJP cuts himble pie=1Rising prices,general anger,oil prices.

- Use hair masks

- If you straighten your hair ALWAYS use heat protectors
5980 2018-12-11 14:53:24 I donated to Beto!  Just a regular Texas voter.  Like most Texans, no ties to the oil industry. The only reason Beto lost was the caravan. Repubs pushed the issue hard that Beto funded the caravan and the immigrants were mostly criminals.

5983 2018-12-11 14:53:20 Quebec should shut the fuck up about Alberta’s energy and oil sectors since they take huge amounts of our money in “equalizers” they don’t need, and then don’t even buy our fucking oil, but will buy Saudi’s.
5984 2018-12-11 14:53:15 ぎゃぁぁしょっくう～～～!!!!
5985 2018-12-11 14:53:05 what am I making up, what's your proof? did those oil&gas executives not give Beto the maximum individual amount?
5986 2018-12-11 14:53:04 And *at least* $81K came in maxed out personal donations. More “oil workers,” I imagine?

Stop pretending as if basic due diligence in looking at whose bankrolling a candidate is an insult.

6007 2018-12-11 14:50:48 I've been reading a bit more on the international front, and there is a compelling thesis that int'l energy trade -- including oil and coal -- can enhance soft power and facilitate more cooperation on climate. Long game vs. short game.

6013 2018-12-11 14:50:02 I think the implication of even @johnmcdonnellMP shying away from saying "climate change" in this context (despite often doing so wrt Heathrow & Fracking), and pledging continued support for oil&gas,
6014 2018-12-11 14:50:00 Maybe bc you x sesuai dgn mineral oil kot?! Bc i had the same experience too! Try guna cleansing oil from cyber colours yg brand ni x de mineral oil

6016 2018-12-11 14:49:51 DOW down since the tax cuts, trade deficit highest in 10 years, deficit heading to record levels. And now, contrary to @realDonaldTrump request, OPEC is cutting production and raising the price of oil. Yes, look at the economy

6018 2018-12-11 14:49:46 Watch it close red today. On a green oil day, a lot of them open strong and then fade throughout the day. Been happening for years. The surest way to a giant fortune would have been to short them on the pop. You'd probably be richer than Croesus if you consistently did that.
6019 2018-12-11 14:49:45 very clever what you did there BBloke.....
6020 2018-12-11 14:49:36 Very fun, especially considering that we're pulling out all that short term fracking oil now at low prices, and will buy from Venezuela later on at five times the cost.
6021 2018-12-11 14:49:34 And that’s why we should stop buying our oil from Saudi Arabia and start finding alternatives.

6028 2018-12-11 14:49:04 You mean Nigeria will cease to exist without oil? Buhari plummeted us into recession ,yara Dua brought us out recession, what's buhari achievement in this regard?
6029 2018-12-11 14:48:46 I hope the Trump's administration  doesn't become an abilitator of the Venezuelan Dictatorship Regime as the Previous Obama's administration.

6032 2018-12-11 14:48:31 Use oil based make up removers. 
6033 2018-12-11 14:48:28 no, if it were capitalist and the oil industry was privatized, the private companies would take the hit. they would increase production to meet demand and sell more oil. more revenue from the private sector means more tax revenue for the federal government.
6034 2018-12-11 14:48:24 We could go the Saudi Ritz Carlton way? Wait, that's only for filthy rich oil states!
6035 2018-12-11 14:48:21 Given the likely future of oil (especially bitumen) I think we better wrap our heads around the need for a PST in Alberta
6036 2018-12-11 14:48:13 Used to be an old saying (backing the days of big consolidations) "The cheapest oil is found on the floor of the stock exchange".  True again soon?

6038 2018-12-11 14:47:52 Left a small flame on when a pan with some oil was on top... that was on for like an hour and I didn’t even realise. I’m gonna die when I move out

6047 2018-12-11 14:47:21 Coal is the problem, not solution, on carbon. Oil is the problem, not solution, on carbon. Gas helps but only if it displaces coal and leak rates are limited. Gas is the problem if it replaces nuclear. All that are facts. Coal could change that fact with CCS but has not.
6048 2018-12-11 14:47:18 So umm a little actual knowledge about what’s really goin on... our President has fulfilled another promise, this one about foreign oil... 1st time since the 40z we’ve exported more oil then we imported! Kinda big deal...

Remember when we discovered Scottish Oil? 
Remember just after that, when England ordered the closing of our Stock Exchange so all of our new oil business would be transferred to their London Stock Exchange

It's not new concept
6053 2018-12-11 14:47:01 Yellow Vest riots are reminiscent of May 1968 protests, which came 2 years before First Quarter Storm, 3 years before Diliman Commune; both Yellow Vest riots and Diliman Commune were fueled by rising oil prices/taxes.

6059 2018-12-11 14:46:33 SK party blew it. You inherited an economic juggernaut that extracted a premium on royalties, that you gave away for a song. There was a chance to use high oil prices to build a more solid base than being reliant on commodity pricing, of which you have little control.
6060 2018-12-11 14:46:21 How @Audi can quote me £328 for an oil change is beyond me... daylight robbery.
6061 2018-12-11 14:46:06 Definitely not as much as the oil companies would hope. 
6062 2018-12-11 14:46:02 Russian Energy Ministry, oil companies plan to meet by year-end to discuss decisions made by OPEC+ producers, Interfax Reports, citing minister Alexander Novak. - BBG #OOTT #Russia #OPEC+
6063 2018-12-11 14:45:38 Remember when we had a Scottish Stock Exchange?
Remember when we discovered Scottish Oil? 
Remember just after that, when England ordered the closing of our Stock Exchange so all of our new oil business would be transferred to their London Stock Exchange.
6064 2018-12-11 14:45:32 Wait, the plant, right? That's not a thing where Ivy league grads sell their credentials to oil companies to become climate denialists?
6065 2018-12-11 14:45:27 Good piece, I remembered Rosneft oil, but having this information reframed is important.
Thank you for doing this!
With such a CORRUPT president, every day there’s at least 5 scandals.
6066 2018-12-11 14:45:20 Fox and Friends may be the Only show on that Network other than Hannity, Tucker and sometimes Ingraham, during the week that build your administration up as it should be. WE ARE OIL SUFFICIENT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS. VARNEY AND LOU are reporting it. MAJOR NEWS!
6067 2018-12-11 14:45:18 The delay is just a spell check issue I’m sure.   They’ll be chatting it through.   Is multi-bagger  a hyphenated word or just one word.   You know....normal stuff.   
6068 2018-12-11 14:45:18 Should work fine for 1P and 2P scanning, though it was designed for #lightsheet.  It's a dipping lens expecting same media all the way to image plane.  With curved first surface it doesn't matter (much) whether media is water or oil or even air.
6069 2018-12-11 14:45:16 Makes me want to oil up and dive in! 
6070 2018-12-11 14:45:15 I need an oil change
6071 2018-12-11 14:45:13 Quebec gets 1.4 billion while  Alberta runs a deficit! Quebec buys dictator oil and stops Canadian pipelines. Quebec isn’t a fair partner of confederation!
6072 2018-12-11 14:45:12 Currently getting a free oil change and im thankful.
6073 2018-12-11 14:45:08 … individuals who work for oil and gas companies *in Texas*. They're kind of a thing there.
6074 2018-12-11 14:45:01 Omg. Couldn't handle the itchy dry gash any longer so applied shitloads of lotion and oregano oil to it and minced off down Sainsbury's. Shop assistant walks past saying 'what's that smell? Can you smell it? It's like spicy'. I almost died @AtlanticFyoo @cornwalltrainer
6075 2018-12-11 14:44:53 I'm interested in the opposite question: how do companies perform with CEOs with advanced non-business degrees (I'm guessing geology/chemistry for oil, engineering/mat sci for chips and tech, comp sci for software, engineering for industrials...)
6076 2018-12-11 14:44:50 Naw did the snake oil salesman sturgeon get her political gambit rejected?, what a shame
6077 2018-12-11 14:44:47 Time to go back to the horse and buggy and oil lamps!
6078 2018-12-11 14:44:28 The "patient" is comfy at 80. Use oil circulating radiator heater in her room. Keeping the rest of the winter house at 67. 74 is good in Summer. She likes 77ish. I acclimate OK.
6079 2018-12-11 14:44:22 Pasture raised chickens, fermented foods, green veggies, no vegetable oil. Limit the sugar. I'm bout all that.
6080 2018-12-11 14:44:20 Oil is a fungible commodity, it doesn't work that way.
6081 2018-12-11 14:44:19 oq será que o oil man ta fazendo agora?
6082 2018-12-11 14:44:13 So I guess that since they don't want oil in the province, cars and trucks are no longer allowed as there is no more gasoline.
6083 2018-12-11 14:44:10 This is such a silly and dismissive Tweet. I’m pretty sure Khashoggi was not a black kid. Let’s start there. Maybe TIME will approach you when they do a “Dumbest Tweet” issue.
6084 2018-12-11 14:44:01 うは凄い長そうw
6085 2018-12-11 14:43:55 vc sabe ne viviane firmes, a primeira lei d quabdo se mudar para curitiba é saber quem é oil man e a segunda é falar vina
6086 2018-12-11 14:43:48 Ive never heard of this oil
Coconut oil has helped a little but maybe this one will lighten them even more.. hopefully
6087 2018-12-11 14:43:45 Remmenber this: if you want to keep seeling your "green" gasoline more expensive than regular gasoline ...

Then you must finance ALARMISTS or else no one will see any advantage in buy you the "green" gasoline ..

If you are an oil firm ...finance ALARMISTS not SKEPTICS ..
6088 2018-12-11 14:43:41 Because the drop in oil happened dramatically lowering the gdp overall wealth of the country. Any major infrastructure costs billions/trillions that they lost when the price drop and at this point the price is rising again so he probably won’t.
6089 2018-12-11 14:43:30 What happened to Mexico paying for the wall. It's been a lie from the get-go and your supporters fell for it. 

You're a quintessential snake oil salesman and a stereotypical used car salesman rolled up into a fake tan and a weird hairdo.
6090 2018-12-11 14:43:25 @WellsGriffith said. "We strongly believe that no country should have to sacrifice their economic prosperity or energy security in pursuit of environmental sustainability." Can't eat coal, can't drink oil, can't breathe gas. Nothing left but mines & money. #GlobalWarming
6091 2018-12-11 14:43:16 In a country that needs Indigenous land for oil, mining and lumber, in a society that needs to control women's reproduction to make sure wealth can be inherited and those who aren't wealthy can do these jobs for far less than the profits are worse, these facts aren't accidents.
6092 2018-12-11 14:43:05 CRUDE OIL

Gyrating between WTI $50.50 to $52.50 for 2 weeks already will make everybody do the exact same thing.

And as you know, those who buy need greater fools to sell to, so, when all do the same game, no greater fools remained.
6093 2018-12-11 14:43:03 Neither was there ever a Modi wave nor was BJP elected to power because of hindutva. The only reason behind BJPs win was the dismal economic situation in 2014. The outcome of these elections are purely the result of increasing oil prices a few months back.
6094 2018-12-11 14:43:03 Oil industry is heavily subsidised in the present day too - we live in a false economy, everything is mis-priced. If negative externalities were included then you wouldn't have milk with your cereal and you wouldn't have cereal either probably
6095 2018-12-11 14:43:01 TOTD: Sweet Potatoes roasted with olive oil, salt, pepper, and cumin, make excellent breakfast vegetables. They are good as leftovers, so you can make a bunch at once and store them for a few days, zap them in the morning.
6096 2018-12-11 14:42:55 Cosrx oil free moist
6097 2018-12-11 14:42:50 Neera Tanden's like, yeah, but it was GOOD oil, YOU BASTARDS, lol.
6098 2018-12-11 14:42:34 Odd statement considering jobs were up in November for Alberta despite oil sector affected by global oil glut.
6099 2018-12-11 14:42:30 Oil and gas do not contribute significantly to climate change. This is a political agenda. You want to talk about plastic waste fine. You want to tell the poorest countries in the world that they're not allowed to use coal so that they can get energy. Be my guest
6100 2018-12-11 14:42:28 US fucked up Middle east for oil, did a terrible job in Vietnam, destroyed Afghanistan, now asking for help from this ally from 'hell' for a safe exit. I dunno what the HELL are you talking about.
6101 2018-12-11 14:42:21 Then explain why Loving Vincent, the animated film in which each frame was an individual oil painting, lost to that year's second Pixar film?
6102 2018-12-11 14:42:17 Who do you think is funding climate engineering???? Dr. David Keith, world expert in climate engineering, , aka geoengineering, is funded  by the oil & gas sector. They get to use aircraft fuel to spray us with toxic mining waste. Its a win- win for them. Politicians don't care.
6103 2018-12-11 14:41:51 Grazie, Jeanette @CookGlobal! Be sure to add a simple ganache as shown for extra decadence  It's simply quality dark chocolate w/ a tablespoon of olive oil melted over a bagnomaria.
6104 2018-12-11 14:41:48 Actually oil is cheap...so when we should be stocking ours away for a rainy day as a strategic move, we're just blowing through our own reserves.  What do you expect from a leader who bankrupted a casino?  #SadButTrump #RussianLaundry #Kompromat #IdiotInChief
6105 2018-12-11 14:41:46 Happy ending and so on. A little oil is a strange fact that, entirely unknown to people.
6106 2018-12-11 14:41:42 I just realized my #oil has not been changed in my #car for over #10,000 #miles #hatebeinganadult #maybeishouldchangeit
6107 2018-12-11 14:41:35 Governments don’t buy oil. Private companies do that. None are headquartered in Quebec, most are in Alberta. The small amount of pollution caused by a few sewage dumps required to repair the system pales in comparison to the decades of pollution caused by the tar sands.
6108 2018-12-11 14:41:33 It seems impossible to keep a tub of sunsoaked tomatoes in the fridge for any length of time without spilling the oil everywhere. #FirstWorldProblems
6109 2018-12-11 14:41:26 Moving Russian Oil and eventually a pipeline for Chinese buyers
6110 2018-12-11 14:41:18 Trump's homie murdered a CNN reporter and a bunch of kids in yemen over oil.
6111 2018-12-11 14:41:17 posso ser o oil man? sempre quis ter o poder de ser gostoso

6114 2018-12-11 14:40:45 How much for an oil change
6115 2018-12-11 14:40:44 Coconut oil helps with it all sis!!!!
6116 2018-12-11 14:40:40 @FitTuber oil free popcorn video..and sprouts info when and how much to consume
6117 2018-12-11 14:40:40 Beto took money from oil and gas executives, which he pledged he would not prior to the campaign.
6118 2018-12-11 14:40:39 TIME cover, nice, but still weak. If they wanted to say who had most impact this year it should've been Trump & the Torching of Democracy. Him burning the Constitution, upside down American flag background, standing on a pile of $$, oil pumping in his veins. Putin ghosting.
6119 2018-12-11 14:40:39 Wild that Trump is the first President in 75 years to export more oil than imported this year, yet not one mainstream media outlet is saying a fucking word. I’m not in love w the guy, but anyone rooting against him is just a fucking fool at this point.

6126 2018-12-11 14:40:06 David Livingston @ACGlobalEnergy with a nice pitch for EVs as part of an #infrastructure bill in new Congress. EVs check many boxes: deploy distributed grid resources, reduce emissions, strengthen US position as net oil exporter. #CopperEnergySummit
6127 2018-12-11 14:40:04 Lol yeah
6128 2018-12-11 14:40:00 How does it work on stretch marks bc I’ve used coconut oil forever and it helped a little but now i feel like it isn’t doing anything anymore

6133 2018-12-11 14:39:30 Are climate deniers really evil, science haters, who love oil and are a threat to the greater good?
Of course not: some of them only love coal -  - #climatechange #sciencematters
6134 2018-12-11 14:39:30 Antibiotics 4x, every herbal / diet change you can think of, any OTC medication you can think of, quit vaping, quit drinking, elevate head while sleeping, coffee enema, neti pot with grapefruit seed extract, neti with oil of oregano and there's a ton I'm forgetting.
6135 2018-12-11 14:39:27 Canada is closing in fast.  If i was lender to countries id ask without oil how is Canada going to pay it back.  Then i would ask for a pay down on the principle
6136 2018-12-11 14:39:17 people cant tell the difference between weed and cbd. so many people think cbd oil gets u fucked up like thc and it puts back our legalization:(
6137 2018-12-11 14:39:14 What?? India, was a British colony forever, Dubai got oil rich, Addas is still not a place you would want to live, Macaw is just part of an emerging east, watch as they all progress via nanotech while we fight over money for walls. We're slipping.
6138 2018-12-11 14:39:13 no oil

6140 2018-12-11 14:39:03 I eat plenty of healthy fats. Olive oil, animal fats. 

Maybe I just need to find a better butter. I'll research some and their ingredients
6141 2018-12-11 14:38:59 Do you need a last minute  for Christmas ? I just received a new stock of oil, message me and I’ll get it out to you
6142 2018-12-11 14:38:44 Stop expanding the oil and gas sectors and start the conversion to #cleanandrenewable #energy!
6143 2018-12-11 14:38:43 What war for oil?  The US has become the world's number one oil and natural gas producer and is a net exporter of both.
6144 2018-12-11 14:38:28 Putin wants a limited nuclear conflict in the world - a short term nuclear winter would make solar less effective and drive up demand for heating oil and gas. He's looking at you western Europe...
6145 2018-12-11 14:38:13 Newt Gingrich is as much as cause of the nasty criminal elements of the Congress as anyone. I blame him and Regan for courting the religious right and the (im)moral majority, for making sure no one could work together. He's a snake who never stops peddling snake oil.
6146 2018-12-11 14:38:01 Won't be long before workers will be laid off in the oil industry...
6147 2018-12-11 14:37:56 They really need to hurry up with this oil change cause my ass needs to get home and finish my final that's due later
6148 2018-12-11 14:37:55 @GM Extremely Upsetting to hear that you guys are dodging this oil consumption issue in your Equinox's... had the choice to go foreign... guest that's what I get for buying american...
6149 2018-12-11 14:37:49 What people here don’t understand is that by this point, oil & gas companies will have abandoned the area for its inaccessibility.  Besides no more industry, there will be no place to live and the Acadian culture which persevered here for about 250 years will disappear forever.
6150 2018-12-11 14:37:46 Add that news to the Dow being up 350 points, oil up 2%, and yet $bte is up less than 2% after falling almost 8% yesterday.
6151 2018-12-11 14:37:41 I am pretty damn sure this article text has changed. I saw this earlier, it contained the attributed phrases: "long-term... stable investment" and doing "everything we possibly can" re oil and gas industry.

I have no axe to grind here, but something peculiar about this.
6152 2018-12-11 14:37:32 Visit them soon before the oil rigs go up.

none can take that energy away from me
6161 2018-12-11 14:36:44 Thought: 
Has there been a political candidate who accepted “campaign contributions” from (an oil lobbyist, say), but, when the time came for quid pro quo, simply said, 
“Hahaha...no, I absolutely will NOT do that, evil person; but I thank you for your support and contribution!”
6162 2018-12-11 14:36:34 Niggas think they Slick but I’m Baby Oil bitchhhhhh 
6163 2018-12-11 14:36:31 Have agreed with this since 2016 @upton1144. Why WOULDN'T those who attacked US / UK elections change just enough votes in just enough States to put their candidates in office? The incentives of 3 SC seats plus a cut of $1 Trillion in oil wealth may have been too irresistible
6164 2018-12-11 14:36:29 In the truck with my 30+ older co-workers and we are jamming out to Thank you, next! Love the oil field

Both parties are addicted to oil lobby's money, as well as pharma money, and the prison industry money. #factsarefacts
6167 2018-12-11 14:36:12 like oil would never dry up, that things wouldn't change. As private citizens, we lived in the now, didn't give an eye to things down the road. Same with our previous premiers. We needed/need to diversify, not keep all our eggs in one basket. The truck point is well made, having
6168 2018-12-11 14:36:05 Lithium only needs to be mined once, where as gasoline powered cars need to have crude oil mined, transported, refined, & transported again before it is even burned in the car. That has to happen for the life of a gasoline powered car. EVs only need to do something like that once
6169 2018-12-11 14:36:02 And of course we don't get any oil from Iran but the rest of Europe have different deals with Iran that why the US is so isolated from the rest of the world China  Iran

6177 2018-12-11 14:34:58 There is only one person to blame for Alberta's discounted oil prices.

If humans build/use this pipeline we continue down the road of high carbon use choices. #Oil would pay high #CarbonTax. Make low #CarbonTax choices. No good for future, can lose big money.

Coconut oil can be helpful if you have dry hair, frizz it will be easier to avoid if you constantly use it before showering.

6182 2018-12-11 14:34:27 Suggest to her using baby oil during sex, but then say you've got none, and suggest washing up liquid instead. 
Then bring out a load of dirty dishes and say you can put them between you to wash them.

6191 2018-12-11 14:33:06 Is that mainly because of the low oil prices though?
6192 2018-12-11 14:33:02 one time i left a bottle of olive oil at maria's house so i went back to get it and i found her gently caressing the olive oil while crying
6193 2018-12-11 14:33:01 Perception. Perception says otherwise. Especially when Quebec apparently gets to stop Alberta oil going east. You think that's good for Confederation?  Just how much abuse from Liberal eastern Canada do you think the west will tolerate?
6194 2018-12-11 14:32:58 @cnnbrk US is now officially an exporter of oil—we no longer depend on foreign oil.  Thank you President Trump for making America Great Again.
6195 2018-12-11 14:32:56 His culties are in denial and deflect attention from the glaringly obvious truth about this snake oil salesman.
6196 2018-12-11 14:32:44 not to be the dumb bitch that doesn't know what the oil is for but what is the oil for
6197 2018-12-11 14:32:39 Your income tax rate at a max of 15% is a joke. Cost of living! Have you ever even visited Toronto? Btw why did you piss away all the oil royalties?
6198 2018-12-11 14:32:35 Good to see you openly defend oil and gas donations. 

Between that and paygo, Democrats will ensure a #GreenNewDeal will never happen......just another reason I don't vote for Democrats anymore.
6199 2018-12-11 14:32:34 Not just nowadays,I think it has been in existence for long,guys I sell original undiluted designer oil perfumes, I also sell car/house/office diffusers, let mW help you and your environment smell fresh and strong
6200 2018-12-11 14:32:29 I used mom’s hair oil concoction and my hair smells disgusting. I wanna go wash these braids 
6201 2018-12-11 14:32:12 It's been a week since I contacted the proprietor of the sea buckthorn berry oil and no response.
If I got heavy metal poisoning from that oil I'm going to kill myself while taking out as many Russians as possible.
Maybe I can get the deep state to cover the airfare.
6202 2018-12-11 14:32:11 The simple fact that your premiere said pipeline are not socially acceptable.... but takes oil money by way of transfer payments. I believe that is what she meant

6209 2018-12-11 14:31:36 Trudeau is not the problem. Trying to manage the Oil industry and pipelines and Climate Change/ Environment is a hobson's choice. We need to come together and stop all the blame and fingerpointing.
6210 2018-12-11 14:31:34 Well all we use is corn that is what 10 % of all gas we use  and it is oil from different sources and refined in Louisiana oil refinery
6211 2018-12-11 14:31:27 Another way of saying it could be, that they fight Against truth, justice and the American way.

6217 2018-12-11 14:31:11 Merkel has sold Germany to Russian oil man Putin. Why does May think Merkel gonna let UK out of EU slave contract?
6218 2018-12-11 14:30:44 We got accustomed to the idea of having the revenue from oil and gas, that we shut down our agriculture and tourism revenue. Trinidad will be a wild west within the next 20 years when the oil is over. Because that's what we depend on thanks to the bad management of the government
6219 2018-12-11 14:30:38 To be fair, he said "the potential" to stop a climate crisis. The fact is a person who doesn't take oil industry money has a higher "potential" than someone who does. (admittedly Beto's take is extremely small, and thus the potential for pressure from big oil would also be small)

6225 2018-12-11 14:29:48 You don't have to believe in climate change to know oil is a finite resource. Best to stop using it for stuff we don't need to use it for like transport. Save if for stuff we haven't got a replacement for yet.

6228 2018-12-11 14:29:33 Who called it a dying industry?

Consumption is irrelevant here. Most of the oil we consume in Canada is refined from crude, not bitumen.

6236 2018-12-11 14:28:45 a drop in oil prices and a drop in oil production combined led to their current situation. in a capitalist system, the market would have adjusted production to meet demand.

6239 2018-12-11 14:28:28 LOL! What about severing relations with the US? Stop shipping oil, stop buying arms, etc... This guy wants to pick on Australia because they're a much smaller trade partner than the US. Hypocritical.
6240 2018-12-11 14:28:24 @OrrinHatch Actually, given the amount of money you get from the pharmaceutical industries as well as gas, oil and coal industries, it is clearly not accurate to call you a hack. You're a whore, plain and simple.
6241 2018-12-11 14:28:15 Putin wasn't in it to make friends , or liked the GOP . It was a financial investment.  Russia's only financial income is Oil .The U.S sanction Obama put on & Hillary would of continued is causing  Russia in a Deep Depression . Donald is a life long Democrat - whom wanted a Tower
6242 2018-12-11 14:28:02 It could also be a patriotric move as buying Tesla cars reduces oil import and US trade deficit meanwhile driving a fast car.
6243 2018-12-11 14:28:02 The homeless person has been abandoned not by me or you. The homeless vet got abandoned by his own government in order to sell a bogus war on a boarder. Or a war over oil. Or a war over civil liberties.. the system is broken
6244 2018-12-11 14:27:41 plus, even if it isn't man-made, being able to harvest energy from essentially infinite sources (solar, wind, hydro, etc) would help humanity grow more than having to spend trillions each year to scrape the bottom of every oil well, so why not push for renewables anyways?

6264 2018-12-11 14:26:03 How large? It's actually less than 1%. And they are wrong. And your money assumption is beyond ridiculous. Earth scientists can earn a lot more if they work for the oil industry.

6279 2018-12-11 14:25:06 I completely agree with u on that. But I disagree u shidnt support oil extraction. I wud support reducing products that produce greenhouse gases. Banning fuel cars being sold in the UK etc.

6325 2018-12-11 14:21:01 But what are you then defining as the medium if not the mechanics used to create the art. In art oil paint is a medium that is the means by which you create. Comics/graphic novels/comic strips all use the medium of sequential art to tell the story where as novels use words.
6326 2018-12-11 14:20:59 Not long ago, I mentioned I had stopped buying palm oil products. Someone told me that...wasn’t right. That I should use ‘sustainable’ palm oil. I don’t agree, and I won’t buy anything with palm. Too many of the products contain soy or are hydrogenated, so not good for me either.

6328 2018-12-11 14:20:56 Yes, @JKuylenstierna, awkward, but typical of Trump to have a fox guarding the chicken house. In this case, Trump picked an oil-and-coal advocate, Wells Griffith, to advise on climate change.

6339 2018-12-11 14:20:05 Neanderthal butchers. Ignorant, hypocritical. Whilst Saudi prince's shoot cocaine, have parties and book top suites at London hotels to do it. But they are RICH, and they have OIL.and its only innocent schoolgirls. So carry on.
6340 2018-12-11 14:20:00 Under the name of making America great again, Trump can make a deal for oil and military weapons with a devil.

6344 2018-12-11 14:19:46 So if the fumes given off from the burning of oil is not harmful to health why don't you try an experiment. Get your car, attached a hose pipe and stuff it through your window keeping the windows up. Turn off the a/c and start your engine.  Please can you report back to me.
6345 2018-12-11 14:19:44 Social accountability! They would rather buy their oil from Saudi Arabia who has one of the worst civil liberties records in the world!

6354 2018-12-11 14:18:36 Not a snob, my chronic acid reflux really determines what I can and can't have. The coconut oil is for my keto diet plan but is very good.
6355 2018-12-11 14:18:36 You obviously have not experienced 'healthcare' in America.

Capitalism and healthcare are like oil and water. They cannot mix.

Protect the wealthy all you want. Genocide the poor and workingclass in the name of capitalism. And if you want to see that nightmare, come to USA.
6356 2018-12-11 14:18:28 It helps when you change the oil.....
6357 2018-12-11 14:18:27 I'm not sure when I acquired a taste for oily fish.
I suspect I've never been particularly anti-oily-fish.
I've been finding what I like best.
Example: I like salmon or trout pan-fried in coconut oil.

6362 2018-12-11 14:18:22 Yes, again your right on this subject. We do not want to see Europe dependant on Russian gas. USA just found HUGE reserves of oil in West Texas. It is not logical to send petrol from USA to Europe. Someday Russia will open up and these disputes will go away. Build your pipeline

6368 2018-12-11 14:17:32 He's essentially already gone. This was his last term and Jared Polis has already been elected as gov. Jared will be much more an advocate for environmental issues, including taking on the oil & gas big money.
6369 2018-12-11 14:17:31 So that's kind of a steady state : bacon every day gives us just as much lard as we need for frying non bacon things.

...but then we ALSO generate 3+ quarts per year at pig slaughter time.

Thinking I should start using that (not veg oil) for deep frying turkey/zuchini fritters
6370 2018-12-11 14:17:27 Oil + 2.30% while USDCAD is down -0.10% . Oil is in for a big move lower while below the OPEC high (+-54$)
6371 2018-12-11 14:17:24 The world is leaving Nigeria behind, with the investment America, Europe & China are putting into developing high density batteries by 2029 crude oil could be priced at $15 per barrel at $52.6 some states are struggling to pay salaries. We should be worried

6418 2018-12-11 14:13:25 The United States is exporting more energy than it imports. So,why do we bother importing anything at all? We should just keep ours and let the Middle East drink their oil.
6419 2018-12-11 14:13:13 There must be ways of vastly reducing demand for palm oil - like opposing the inclusion of biofuels in the EU's mandatory target for transport
6420 2018-12-11 14:13:08 I'm a big fan. Also a fan of the smell of burning oil that comes from a two-stroke engine.
6421 2018-12-11 14:13:07 I get it, but there's a difference between taking big $ from the oil industry and taking small donor contributions from individuals who happen to work for the industry yet want to support a Democrat, or just oppose Cruz. For the moment, I'm giving Beto the benefit of the doubt.

6433 2018-12-11 14:11:49 They also served under Saudi allies, the Republicans. Saudis are also allies with Likkud party of Israel and current Republicans like Trump and Kushner. They're pretty much trying to cause chaos where they can to stimulate their oil economy. They do anything to sell their oil.
6434 2018-12-11 14:11:44 On the real, we tried oil as well. He now uses shower gell, just because it's the only guarantee we have that he'll use soap to shower.
6435 2018-12-11 14:11:40 Power. They own a whole fuck ton of oil. If governments move away from fossil fuels...they lose power. Money they have.
6436 2018-12-11 14:11:31 The United States is exporting more energy than it imports. So,why do we bother importing anything at all? We should just keep ours and let the Middle East drink their oil.

6438 2018-12-11 14:11:11 It does not have anything to do with "starting mighty early".

It is more the result of the widespread belief that sex with a virgin cures HIV.

6439 2018-12-11 14:11:09 I made this and it was delish. The only thing different for me was that I had bough the harissa dried and didn’t know how to prep it so I ground it down and added olive oil. Don’t know if that was the right thing to do but my family wolfed it down.
6440 2018-12-11 14:11:08 Well, we’ll agree to differ on the outlook. However, the Oil faction still has to make a better case for building the pipes. They haven’t convinced whomever they need to convince so far. I think they need to curtail production not increase it. It’s what OPEC does to boost profit

6442 2018-12-11 14:11:00 The United States is now exporting oil for the first time in 70 years. Just wanted to let people know because I haven't heard anything about it on the main stream media.
6443 2018-12-11 14:10:59 Once I wash my hair, I saturate it in conditioner & use my detangler tool. I rinse the conditioner out & let it air dry with no product in it which allows my curls not to coil up as much. Once it’s dry I use some oil and my fingers or detangling tool again to stretch it to a fro

6461 2018-12-11 14:09:52 What about FM.  When crude oil price went down he just increased excise and appropriated the amount I stead of passing it to people.  Many other such steps including Income-tax exemption limits, slabs etc in tune with inflation etc
6462 2018-12-11 14:09:51 Where’s the real money at stake? Big oil and coal companies. They have money to fund a conspiracy and the incentive since their incomes are threatened. Scientists could make more money by working for those companies. These days, they could lose funding by supporting the truth.

That said, model 3 is amazing!
6471 2018-12-11 14:09:10 The United States is exporting more energy than it imports. So,why do we bother importing anything at all? We should just keep ours and let the Middle East drink their oil.

Hugo Chavez "Socialism" in 2000 pumped 3.2M bbl/oil per day
Today an idiot dictator pumps 1.17M bbl/oil per MONTH in Sept
North Dakota pumped 1.3M bbl/oil per month in September passing the country with the largest oil reserves.  @realDonaldTrump a REAL opportunity.
6481 2018-12-11 14:08:36 "need to diversify"  You're a dupe, BIG oil is best positioned to seize upon the subsidies and tax incentives.
6482 2018-12-11 14:08:36 And for anyone (read: Liberals) who doesn't understand that oil independence is a National Security item, they are blind.  Try to wage a war when you can't fuel planes or your vehicles.  It's impossible.
6483 2018-12-11 14:08:30 Also for the first time in 75 years the U.S. is an oil exporter

6491 2018-12-11 14:08:16 Absolutely a good point. And I thought this article takes care to note that. But Beto did also get a number of high-dollar donations from Oil&Gas executives, and that is not the same as small dollar donors who "just happen to work there."
6492 2018-12-11 14:08:12 Remind u oil spill n Gulf happened under drilling appvd by Obama Energy Dept. Alaska spill drunk pilot. Pipelines cross cross nation with no spills. Alaska pipeline no spills. Obama/Hillary stopped pipeline to benefit Buffet’s railroad whose tankers r sole transport

6503 2018-12-11 14:07:31 IMO this is just Wall Street/oil company shills trying to justify being same.
6504 2018-12-11 14:07:31 But, that being said, 2500 unemployed auto workers will get more consideration from our federal government than 10s of 1000s oil patch workers. Nobody here is asking for bailout, just want to work and support our families. Thanks though for your empathy.

Have you heard that the world is slowly moving away from fossil fuels to green energy - which is proving to be cheaper. Soon it will need less oil

You would only own the oil if you nationalised the facilities. Which would lead to you not being able to sell the oil.

6595 2018-12-11 13:59:52 The Democrats are aligned with Iran, Qatar, and the Russian oligarchy.  Together they want to break the back of OPEC, return control of oil prices to the TX Railroad Commission.

6601 2018-12-11 13:59:35 This guy said my oil change would be 45 minutes and I’ve been waiting for 59 minutes. I’m ready to go!!!!
6602 2018-12-11 13:59:10 Some websites are reporting that the USA EXPORTED more oil than we imported recently.....which hasn’t been done since 1940’s .....is this true?  If so, great job President Trump!! @POTUS and @realDonaldTrump
6603 2018-12-11 13:59:10 Average consumer: Doesn’t change their own oil let alone pay attention to funny sounds a car starts making when something’s wrong. You are hitting a spot called simplicity. F, GM and FCA need to step back and rethink  again. GL and TY!

By the way these petrochemicals cannot be synthesized as yet or we would be doing so.

Sorry I can’t be of more help, but my expertise is on the oil industry side.
6616 2018-12-11 13:58:36 I will believe people are serious about climate change when they all give up their cars, oil heat, anything plastic, toilet paper, jet rides, vacations, train rides, rv's, bus rides, and the list goes on.  Virtually everything involves fossil fuels, so educate please.

6621 2018-12-11 13:57:45 Also hard to take Trump comments about low oil prices at face value based on this type of interaction.  Low oil price tweets are just for public consumption I believe.

6630 2018-12-11 13:56:30 Expose the lie, like fossils fules, oil is made by the earth constantly. Fossils found 16k, yet oil down to 32k. Dosen't add up. Again due the research.
6631 2018-12-11 13:56:23 U.S. exported more oil than it imported... moving toward energy independence! Boom! #MAGA
6632 2018-12-11 13:56:23 There's no silver bullet, but Wilmar and others acting more responsible is a positive step to stopping deforestation. I don't think boycotting Palm oil works, because the alternatives aren't great for the planet either.

I understand what per-captita means, but do you understand the point?
6640 2018-12-11 13:55:27 No it is not a lie!  Our oil prices were set by foreign countries! We had reserves less than we should have due to both processing and political handicaps placed on the oil industry! Now we have expanded production to be able to export oil!!!

6644 2018-12-11 13:55:03 I’ll add a caveat, though. The only time they’re the best is when they’re hot out of the oven. Packaged, they’re dry as hell. I’ve learned to rescue them by putting them in a pan (no oil) on the stove (covered). Makes crust crispy on the bottom, and the grease does the cooking.
6645 2018-12-11 13:54:59 If data is the new oil in 21st century, then #FANG and similar others are just the next versions of Standard Oil, Ma Bell, etc. Except this time the idea of consumer harm hasn’t yet been amended to mean something more than monetary.

6652 2018-12-11 13:54:25 After this winter I need a new set of summer tires also due to lifetime span of the original tires. 
Besides the window wipers,  this is the only replacement of stuff I needed in 6,5 years, no oil change, etc, nada...
6653 2018-12-11 13:54:19 And obviously the way to win is to support the oil industry, the right wing Israel lobby and the very popular bankers on Wall Street. This method has worked so well in the past ask HRC.

6661 2018-12-11 13:53:33 @GretaThunberg saw you on DN!  Very good!  My country, USA, uses 105.6billion barrels of oil every year on wars in the Middle East, more than all of civilian use in the U.S.. Global warring IS global warming..
6662 2018-12-11 13:53:01 We never have nor will we ever be dependent on foreign oil. Do a little research and prove it to yourself. It's  called a almanac. 1972, imports equaled our exports. Then it went to funny math. Still after shoving there shit. Still the same. We are the leading producers of oil.
6663 2018-12-11 13:52:51 If we really want to explore Mars just tell the government there's oil there. The army would've invaded that shit yesterday
6664 2018-12-11 13:52:35 I think edu is the best policy. We need to continue to educate rest of the world about responsible climate aware development of the resource as a transitional (as long as markets demand oil) economy that is absolutely necessary. Crippling CDN does nothing for carbon reduction

6687 2018-12-11 13:51:21 It's because everyone knows climate change is real. They're just in denial yet, still seek validation by being a part of an iconic brand that is Tesla. Oil won't die out till these people are dead anyway so they don't view Tesla as a competitor.

6727 2018-12-11 13:48:37 Was there any social intervention programme for the less privileged under 16 yrs of PDP rule even when oil price in d international market was very high?
6728 2018-12-11 13:48:33 You guys should be drop the “Public” in your name and replace it with “Big Oil”. Like it or not, renewables are going to take over in 10 years in big oil markets. China and India already prefer Solar over oil and gas for electricity.
6729 2018-12-11 13:48:32 My comment was not abt alternative ways 2 produce/manufacture materials that ar normally derived from crude oil.
6730 2018-12-11 13:48:29 えぇ....(困惑)
6731 2018-12-11 13:48:14 My Essential Rewards for December
Thyromin - I am feeling much more calmer and balanced. 
Wolfberry Eye Cream - This will last a long time and only takes a dab.
Cedarwood essential oil - Samuel's favorite for his diffuser at night
Lemongrass - Freebie this month!
6732 2018-12-11 13:48:09 Who owns Time now?
6733 2018-12-11 13:48:08 @sainsburys almost bought your vegan mince pies (last time I really liked them) but having checked the ingredients I noticed palm oil in it. So I won’t buy it again :(
6734 2018-12-11 13:47:55 #Oil Trivia for your morning coffee.  What is the largest refinery in the USA?  Motiva Enterprises in Port Arthur, Texas.  Who owns 100% of this refinery?  Saudi Arabia.  $24B in revenue in 2004.  Also with this refinery they own 24 distribution terminals.
6735 2018-12-11 13:47:38 Oil hurt the PPI, too. That was expected of course. 0.1 is better than zero point none.
6736 2018-12-11 13:47:36 Did you guys hear this. The US exported more oil last week than it imported. We need to get $MMEXD built.
6737 2018-12-11 13:47:35 Oil paint scented candles hhhhhhh
6738 2018-12-11 13:47:35 I wish I had somebody to take my car to get the oil changed .
6739 2018-12-11 13:47:33 Our source is all the Saudi hijackers. Also Bush had business dealings with Saudis like Cheney so of course they went to Iraq and Afghanistan... History won't be too nice to them either. Republicans, Russians, and Saudis. The pyramid of evil and oil while civilized world moves on

6742 2018-12-11 13:47:17 Dear BJP IT Cell,

Please apna wala woh graph bana ke lagao na.

The one you had put up to show oil prices are actually lower in Modi regime..
6743 2018-12-11 13:47:16 January is coming.  What promises?  No wall, companies losing money and closing, sides with the Crown Prince because of oil over a mans/ Khashoggi's life.  Political stunt that is and was keeping our Service Men and Women away from their families. Farmers crops, Stocks down.
6744 2018-12-11 13:47:16 Wey you @FBN_help @FBN_help 
Some of us live on a bloody budget!!!
I'm neither working in an oil company nor a thieving politicians child!
Give me my 30k!!!
ENOUGH of this nonsense!!!!
6745 2018-12-11 13:47:05 Lmfao why because they didn't take a snake oil salesmans bait? 
6746 2018-12-11 13:46:58 For the first time in 70 yrs, the United States is exporting more oil than we import...Another promise kept by @realDonaldTrump . #USDominance ! Thank you #PresidentTrump !
6747 2018-12-11 13:46:57 あヘリはしないかな....
6748 2018-12-11 13:46:44 saya pakai eskinol oil control, okay gila sebab minyak kurang and jerawat pum takut nak datang.
6749 2018-12-11 13:46:37 Keep ur dirty oil
6750 2018-12-11 13:46:33 Yeah. Record low unemployment across the spectrum. No longer dependent on foreign oil. Wages up, taxes low. Standing up for U.S interests. Putting Americans first. HOW DARE HE.
6751 2018-12-11 13:46:29 About to give myself chemical burns with the amount of tea tree oil I’ve just put on my spots fuck it Buuuurns
6752 2018-12-11 13:46:29 Alberta has a pretty good farming and ranching sector .i would like to see a comparison with quebecs they also have a few resources besides oil
6753 2018-12-11 13:46:27 Large 1960,s oil painting, doesn't she remind you of Nigella Lawson#masterchef#greatcooks#christmasfood
6754 2018-12-11 13:46:21 The camera obscura had been used for centuries, and no, as oil glazes take weeks to dry
6755 2018-12-11 13:46:20 あへっちゃうこんなの

6757 2018-12-11 13:46:04 Sbb my skin so dry, I pakai layers. 1st spray dgn hydrating hatomugi, 2nd sapu lotion i beli dkt bodyshop. Bio oil pun I ada pakai. But paling senang, I beli nivea conditioner dkt Malaysia and it really helps prevent it. Pakai lps sabun badan. Tapi tak jumpa pulak dkt jepun 
6758 2018-12-11 13:46:03 I am listening to your proposed bill and I am in full support. For seven years I have been dependent on Morphine 4 times a day for chronic pain .  Now  taking CBD (Cannabis) Oil capsules which are available as a food supplement through health shops legally. Pain free periods now.
6759 2018-12-11 13:46:00 These were small dollar donations. Many of them are HR specialists, accountants, payroll, etc. They work for oil & gas companies because that’s who is in Texas. They have no particular loyalty to the industry. Replace it with something else and they’ll happily work there.
6760 2018-12-11 13:45:55 It would be nice to see energy HYG separated from the rest. Most of the rise in premiums is to my understanding from the oil sector.
6761 2018-12-11 13:45:50 なるほどそれは嬉しい！
6762 2018-12-11 13:45:44 There is a difference between making progress toward cleaner energy, and demonizing 1.3 million American workers. If you kill the oil and gas industry overnight, our economy will collapse. We can change the future by collaborating with the O&G industry.
6763 2018-12-11 13:45:32 Interesting side note: for some reason, the circle pad on my old 3DS smells like popcorn butter monkaS
and it’s sticky like said oil... monkaS

6764 2018-12-11 13:45:30 Sunny Day from LUSH is an anti static / detangler and it works really well! The only oil in there is essential oil for fragrance

6768 2018-12-11 13:45:09 @ATWWDpodcast in case nobody helped with the catholic stuff in this weeks episode -correct holy water is just blessed water -also correct baptism is oily...they use Sacred Chrism (oil mixture) later in the ritual. Looking forward to the exorcism episode! #theologyteacher
6769 2018-12-11 13:45:04 Exactly. We should be using oil for materials like our plastics (keyboards, phones etc) not fuel smh. That’s the dumbest way to use it cuz it’s a finite resource.
6770 2018-12-11 13:44:54 Except, Quebecers aren't really a beneficiary of the oil industry per se, they're a beneficiary of a federal program designed to help put them on a more equal footing with Albertans, who have become significantly richer than they are thanks to the oil industry.
6771 2018-12-11 13:44:54 Oil change 
6772 2018-12-11 13:44:52 หลังจากนั้นเราก็ไม่กล้า ที่จะคุยเลย555
6773 2018-12-11 13:44:49 I am republican but I support Dems here.  Need anything to help my oil equities.  They have been beaten to He..
6774 2018-12-11 13:44:46 $SX7E still hugely underperforming the main indices.
I was bullish EU banks as a sector into year end but it's not working at all
Even the Energy sector, with oil collapsing >20$, is doing much better.
6775 2018-12-11 13:44:44 Once a week. I wash with shampoo, use a deep conditioner for a few hours then rinse, put in leave in and do my protective style with oil and a cocktail of two creams I like. I refresh throughout the week with this coconut oil spritzer thing from Cantu
6776 2018-12-11 13:44:44 Oil aja 
6777 2018-12-11 13:44:41 Why Is trying to get an oil change ALWAYS a process
6778 2018-12-11 13:44:38 You can’t fry in oil olive it’s funny tasting
6779 2018-12-11 13:44:18 And CCCs followed oil prices down
6780 2018-12-11 13:44:10 Oil is good. Love oil. Love my truck. Bigger the better.
6781 2018-12-11 13:44:07 The oil on my car is low, could that be caused by your network changes?
6782 2018-12-11 13:44:04 The US is exporting more oil for the 1st time In 75 yrs but you won’t hear that on the #FakeNewsMedia
6783 2018-12-11 13:44:00 How ya know when ya car need oil 
6784 2018-12-11 13:43:56 So you say I can eat palm oil and not feel bad?
6785 2018-12-11 13:43:54 Power is a natural resource as is oil and gas. Is that resource included as income for Quebec when equalization payments are computed?
6786 2018-12-11 13:43:43 I fry in canola oil when I have to fry foods
6787 2018-12-11 13:43:40 What happened at #Petrojam wasn't a failure to act by the Board. Looks more like a deliberate act to create the conditions for corruption. The story of the ruse they used to fire the GM who reduced the oil loss to 49,000 barrels is revealing #FollowTheMoney who will go to prison?
6788 2018-12-11 13:43:37 I’m rubber your glue defense sounds like Rudy has been burning the midnight oil
6789 2018-12-11 13:43:37 Yeah then why are you allowing Canadians to buy corrupt blood oil from Saudi Arabia? Stand up for Canada . Do the right thing and support AB oil
6790 2018-12-11 13:43:31 It is request to PMIK and Asad Umer Please do some better planning for those companies which have stooped their production in Previous Government 
Some of these companies are mention below

6791 2018-12-11 13:43:23 Still not sure what Norway's position would be now I know EEA has support of SNP & others although not sure they understand the implications but I still think staying members of EU is by far best deal for Scotland We're not Norway Don't have a trillion-pounds oil fund to rely on
6792 2018-12-11 13:43:22 O ti ri eni keji ri?
6793 2018-12-11 13:43:08 Igbo babes should be one of naija's most important natural resource after oil.
6794 2018-12-11 13:43:02 I only cook in olive oil so my shit be extra healthy even when I’m not trying to be lol
6795 2018-12-11 13:42:50 Hmm, this climate change thing sounds bad. And the oil industry doesn’t seem to care. But then again, Beto does skateboard...
6796 2018-12-11 13:42:49 Thank YOU #MyPresident for working tirelessly against all odds to keep us safe from crime & disease & ridiculous costs of more illegals sucking our programs dry! Thanks for making oil independence a reality too! #MAGA #KAG #TuesdayThoughts
6797 2018-12-11 13:42:49 Oh yes. "Oil and gas" is the new "Wall St." while you worship AN INDIVIDUAL who has perfected the grift to the point he's amassed a rabid neophyte horde of simpletons to regurgitate his lies....
6798 2018-12-11 13:42:45 Beto got $430K in small dollar donations (out of about $70 million) from individuals who report they work in the oil and gas industry.  In Texas, where oil & gas is a leading employment sector. Nobody thinks they’re getting influence with a senator for a $200 donation.
6799 2018-12-11 13:42:44 stop killing oil prices!
6800 2018-12-11 13:42:41 I need clothes, my face wash, my aloe Vera, my tea tree oil, my vitamins, my green drink. Ain’t shit here but church & pork

6810 2018-12-11 13:41:50 he was quite hawkish about wage inflation the last time, can easily dial it down a notch, will also revise the inflation estimates lower as they use the oil futures curve which has moved moved over 25% lower since the last meeting. HE WILL BE DOVISH 100%

6824 2018-12-11 13:40:14 Some people tried to explain the N1Trillion fuel subsidy payment.

Candidate Buhari called fuel subsidy a scam. Does he know better now as President?

Or the fear of oil workers’ strike is making him pay for a scam?

6825 2018-12-11 13:40:12 I don't disagree. But everyone seems to agree that governments have a role to play in solving the current situation with Alberta oil. That will no doubt require more tax dollars.

6830 2018-12-11 13:39:40 Its got to be. Furthermore, I’ve never seen any solar panels on any of the mansions. Even his private beach club he still goes to (property which is listed at $39mill) ocean drive and its heating source is oil. Yet I’m expected to ride a bicycle to work every day! GTF outta here.
6831 2018-12-11 13:39:39 I just don't trust the Flames to beat Oilers in the playoffs, and losing to the Oil in a playoff round would be a sports low for sure. I would absolutely love it, if I had more faith in a victory
6832 2018-12-11 13:39:35 Sadly no. We are awaiting a Health Certificate for the Krill Oil. I’m going to post you a tee shirt today. Sorry for the delay
6833 2018-12-11 13:39:20 Secretary Perry, you are the perfect official and expert of the US to assist KRG and Iraq on oil and energy policy. Good luck.

6836 2018-12-11 13:39:11 @DieselBrosTV what does it mean for a 7.3 to let out a few ounces of oil only on cold days at startup? The truck does not have a block better. Guess it's due to being a Texas gulf coast truck  but why is it loosing this oil in only these conditions?
6837 2018-12-11 13:39:06 Yes sir, you are very right. One is trying to return to cont looting our wealth while the other that should hav been an elder stateman is trying to paint falsehood against PMB, cos hes afraid of loosing his oil well, the truth will prevail.
6838 2018-12-11 13:38:58  My stomach. Baba you’re right wallahi. Looking at the per capital income of an individual we’re not only poor but extremely poor. 
Sadly we’re not aware and once you talk they will mention Oil Money. We already misused that era and now we must admit we’re broke AF
6839 2018-12-11 13:38:57 This is crazy, but so are all Time covers anyway, nuts and insane, non-reality.
6840 2018-12-11 13:38:56 Hi Sheriff,
As you probably know, the snake oil you voted for isn’t quite up to the standards you expected, or were told by fantasists to expect. 
May has got the best deal available, and no-one wants it, so we’ll stay as we are, thanks for your attention
6841 2018-12-11 13:38:42 Been reading up on the US’s activities at the U.N. climate change summit and it is e m b a r r a s s i n g 
Y’all really ready to let millions die so you can make money off oil, huh?
6842 2018-12-11 13:38:24 Try citronella oil diluted with water and spray on the tree. Cats supposedly hate it.
6843 2018-12-11 13:38:21 In that case, stop your war for oil.  You might have secured US's oil supply, but you unleashed misery.
6844 2018-12-11 13:38:14 Bro get some nice balsam samples sent to you. This is your way to get in the olive oil game

6846 2018-12-11 13:37:58 My dad grew a moustache when he was away for work in the oil fields for two months. I was four and scared to death of him when he came back. Until I heard his voice.
6847 2018-12-11 13:37:58 Scotland can do as it likes but if it chooses a benevolent leader to represent it playing snake oil salesman tactics with our party then it deserves to be rebutted

6852 2018-12-11 13:37:16 And you believe

10,000 oil workers donated to Beto O'Rourke?
6853 2018-12-11 13:37:15 yum! i also like to add chopped sundried tomatoes sauted in a little oil to give an extra kick of umami 
6854 2018-12-11 13:37:14 Adding a retinoid oil changed my skin overnight. Highly recommend. But get a sample first because it can be abrasive if you have sensitive skin. And I don’t use it every night - maybe 3-4 times a week?

6860 2018-12-11 13:36:49 How much oil does Trudeau import? 
I'll giver you 3 guesses.
6861 2018-12-11 13:36:35 Chavez was a reverse Robin Hood. Venezuela made mountains of money from oil reserves. Most countries take that revenue and spread it around. In Alaska (while not a country) every citizen gets a rebate from the state from oil $$$. That's socialism. Chavez kept it. That's not.
6862 2018-12-11 13:36:20 It is hilarious that the closer we get to the election the more the NDP care about the economy and the oil industry.  Where was this 2 years ago?
6863 2018-12-11 13:36:16 It’s old tech. Has been used for decades in oil well cementing
6864 2018-12-11 13:36:15 Frying everything with palm oil actually. Thank me now
6865 2018-12-11 13:36:11 Most #Oil and #Gas companies rely on paper-based systems to keep track of products. Get ahead of the game, save time with Infochip.
6866 2018-12-11 13:35:59 i’d have put oil in it, take it to halfords they’ll do it
6867 2018-12-11 13:35:52 Look just because your benevolent leader is doing the snake oil salesman dance is no need to come whining when she can't sway the parliamentary opposition when they see through it, it was tried and seen off, as you were
6868 2018-12-11 13:35:50 Eh, @TIME is just a clock-bait (click-bate?) outfit, not a news agency. Same with most of the old dead tree publications.
6869 2018-12-11 13:35:26 After 3 generations of oil production you’d think Alberta would diversify its economy by now. 
6870 2018-12-11 13:35:21 Oil prices haven't been this low in a very long time, not just in the US bozo.

6875 2018-12-11 13:35:00 I'd like to respond to that sarcastically: Yes, I relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it.
6876 2018-12-11 13:34:40 Time to get rid of oil and the industry all together.  Make it obsolete.
6877 2018-12-11 13:34:35 It means common sens is on the way! You better realize that oil business is a dead end or simply get out of the way!
6878 2018-12-11 13:34:28 Remember the British government had to compensate slave traders in order to end the slave trade. Hi suspect that Somehow the world will have to accommodate oil and coal states to a degree
6879 2018-12-11 13:34:17 There are so many benefits for Scotland being in the United Kingdom eg in recent years 63% of Scottish exports (excluding gas and oil) went to the UK
6880 2018-12-11 13:34:00 そうであろう
6881 2018-12-11 13:33:56 The people know better. We don't care if the Russians have oil and gas.

6885 2018-12-11 13:32:56 3. The report by the Auditor General highlighted that the breakdown in the governance structure at Petrojam and missing oil long existed from his tenure as Minister. How can we take Phillips seriously when Paulwell is so forefront?
6886 2018-12-11 13:32:50 @JasonAndDeb  I worked at a mid level steakhouse as a prep cook the kitchen manager was a huge douche always making disgusting and racist comments the day I had enough I cleaned out the fryers filled them with half water half oil turn them on at they were bubbling over I walked
6887 2018-12-11 13:32:48 I love getting my @inthemomentmag But I really wasn’t happen with this months mag as they are advertising a soap product - and in the recipe it’s telling people to buy Palm Oil. Isn’t this something we’re trying to discourage and combat?

If you mix your Kale with a little bit of cheap oil ...

... it makes it easier to scrape it out of the pan and into the garbage can 
6891 2018-12-11 13:32:19 There was a law passed in the 70s that prevented the U.S from using and exporting its own oil.
6892 2018-12-11 13:32:18 The move is Oil Panic, so the Oil Slick could work.

6897 2018-12-11 13:31:30 Does this apply to water, electricity and supermarkets? I actually agree that these companies should probably have the right to operate as political tools of manipulation but should the top 10 oil companies have the right to collide to deny service to anyone they choose?
6898 2018-12-11 13:31:27 This is the ultimate example of media onanism.
6899 2018-12-11 13:31:24 ONWA ON THE MARBLE(Wisdom

"It is only in my country, Nigeria that leaders spend all their lives fighting and talking about oil, but even in Banana Republic monkies don't spend all their time eating and talking about bananas".

By Onwa Okey Armstrong
6900 2018-12-11 13:31:18 The "facts" he reported were cherry-picked. Beto was #2 in donations from people employed in oil in the state which is by far #1 in oil employment but left that part out. The dishonesty was disturbing right there. Leah's imagery seems to have unhinged him completely.
6901 2018-12-11 13:31:16 We can just take the oil.... and we should....
6902 2018-12-11 13:31:06 A small example, I recently saw @bellacaledonia question a Scotsman journalist on why they didn't mention climate change in a story about a new oil development. She replied that they would have been happy to include a quote about climate change if anyone had sent one in.
6903 2018-12-11 13:30:56 "Individuals" that work in oil or gas. Maybe those individuals are also worried about climate change. Individuals don't always reflect the views of the company  they work for.

6910 2018-12-11 13:30:19 U.S. wholesale inflation creeps up 0.1% in November, PPI shows. But yearly rate of wholesale inflation slows to 2.5% from 2.9%. Down from recent peak of 3.4%. Falling oil prices play big role. Core: +0.3, 2.8%.
6911 2018-12-11 13:30:15 Even before the oil finishes, the both partner must be aware something is going wrong but they choose to watch it dry off.
6912 2018-12-11 13:30:14 To boost economy give extra money in the hand of ppl as US has done,reduce tax in each slab, Bring oil under GST, reduce interest rates,Declare 5 days week to boost spending,Even cause of poor can be achieved by rising economy,jobs can be created if there is demand n investments.

Use anti-inflammatory oils such as olive oil, macadamia nut  oil, coconut oil or …
6932 2018-12-11 13:28:09 Took my car, this morning, for an oil change at Take 5. The manager and the technician were excellent! They explained everything to me and didn't try to upsell.  I will definitely go back.  #FriendlyService
6933 2018-12-11 13:28:05 Sir, Doesn't help too much under the current taxes on fuel. Obove 80 oil PSUs will bleed , between 65 to 80 public will bleed due to the tax regime , and 55 to 65 fuel  just gets back to less expensive zone .

Regardless it remains one of the best oil plays, just trying to determine value. Have a good day 
6962 2018-12-11 13:25:25 No. It’s a legitimate disagreement about policy and funding. We are poisoning our atmosphere and we need more pressure on politicians to stop taking oil money. Nothing personal. Beto seems like a nice guy but that’s immaterial. No politician is above scrutiny.
6963 2018-12-11 13:25:23 And that’s such a rarity in this environment dahling. No one here does that.

7000 2018-12-11 13:21:48 Yeah oil plunge is scary as it reminds of late 2015/start 2016 panic. This widening is also due to the ugly illiquidity in credit right now, as dealers have no balance sheet and RM trying to get out all at the same time

7007 2018-12-11 13:21:04 Mcdavid Draisaitl Vs Rantanen Mackinnon is gonna be sick tonight. Oil Would be in a playoff spot with win I believe...
7008 2018-12-11 13:21:02 Once radiation starts wash skin with fregrance free soap and fregrance free moisturizeror oil . If patient starts to develop burning with no skin changes calamine lotion is an option .. once skin changes develop fucicort cream is the treatment
7009 2018-12-11 13:20:54 We ran out of oil because of course the gauge is broken. Please stop, 2018.
7010 2018-12-11 13:20:51 I CRIED through it! 
I tried to GET OUT of it! 
I almost DIED in it! 
But I SURVIVED ALL of it! 
It was a MESS and didn’t feel good! 
But it was for GOD'S GLORY!! 
I can’t take ANY CREDIT!! 
I PAID A PRICE FOR THIS OIL!!!!

7011 2018-12-11 13:20:47 ((Get the dry cookie dough mix, add a little extra oil and water to make up for using no eggs in it (use no eggs in it) and voila! You have cookie dough that is perfectly edible.))
7012 2018-12-11 13:20:42 A message to the President of United States of America. You chose money over the life of a journalist who had legal status to be here. How are utterly embarrassing. From the pit of my stomach I am disgusted for all journalist. Human life is more precious than gold or oil.

7016 2018-12-11 13:20:15 But Travis - he tried suing the oil companies.
7017 2018-12-11 13:20:07 oh fuck google says u cant put anything inside the humidifier unless its like essential oil
7018 2018-12-11 13:20:07 Kale, ie black cabbage, is lovely steamed on toasted bread drizzled with new Tuscan olive oil.  Add a paper thin slice of warmed lardo di cinta sinese and you’re good to go. Pineapple on pizza is a sin against all that is good.
7019 2018-12-11 13:19:56 The @AsIAmNaturally dry and itchy scalp hair treatment oil works, but it definitely carries a smell. Use it at night.
7020 2018-12-11 13:19:52 That's what you get with 43 years of PC govt and 10 years of fed cpc govt. *let the easterners freeze in the dark* was said. Well they didn't freeze. They bought foreign oil.
7021 2018-12-11 13:19:49 Poor dude. I want to buy him an oil change for a Holiday present so he can keep delivering. If you find out who he is, let me know.
7022 2018-12-11 13:19:45 Nah its going to $25 a barrel. No one uses oil anymore and there is an unlimited supply of it
7023 2018-12-11 13:19:25 Well, it is actually done by the independent oil & gas companies of #Texas.  President and his team happens to provide tail end regulatory supports to the industry under Scott Pruit. The nation owes a big thank you to Late George Mitchell, Aubrey McClendon and the #CiscoKids!

7025 2018-12-11 13:19:11 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
7026 2018-12-11 13:19:06 You mean the same performance as the rest of the sector ? The performance that was due to the $30 dollar drop in oil price ?
7027 2018-12-11 13:19:05 Our government subsidizing Big Oil = Socialism. In fact, corporations, big banks, the military industrial complex etc., are the largest recipients of government funding/ social welfare!
7028 2018-12-11 13:19:02 I’ve been using it for my dog that started having seizures. She had been having clusters of 3 when they happened and the last time after starting the oil it was only 1 mild one. I’m hoping we can get to none.
7029 2018-12-11 13:18:59 Geothermal causes earthquakes and is scarce and costly
Solar is expensive and still requires earth resources to build
Either way, oil is cheaper and natural and the standard though can be mishandled. Any form of energy is destructive, and style of living is destructive.
7030 2018-12-11 13:18:54 You can be glad that he got oil and gas from individuals in Texas.
That  means Texas is turning blue despite its  oil and gas...
7031 2018-12-11 13:18:50 Because it is insignificant and irrelevant compared to his corruption, nepotism, incompetence and ability to make an embarrassing farce of a once respected post.  But keep licking Sarah you might find oil (snake oil).
7032 2018-12-11 13:18:38 The oil industry needs to be phased out to save the planet. The rest follows.
7033 2018-12-11 13:18:34 OIL: Oil prices were under pressure amid worries over global stock markets and doubts that planned output cuts led by producer club OPEC will be enough to rein in oversupply.
7034 2018-12-11 13:18:33 Soon there will be not be a single spec long in oil...

7039 2018-12-11 13:18:08 Russia plans to cut its oil output by at least 50,000 to 60,000 barrels per day (bpd) in January, its energy minister said on Tuesday, much less than its target under a global production deal reached last week #WeakSauce
7040 2018-12-11 13:17:57 Not palm oil. Good day.
7041 2018-12-11 13:17:48 Also I would like so see them explain how capitalism could have saved them. Venezuela’s gdp and exports were mainly oil. The country started to decline after the massive drop in oil prices. Any economic theory in that economy wouldn’t have worked
7042 2018-12-11 13:17:48 I use a scalp renewal oil (mixture of oil n water) which is amazing
7043 2018-12-11 13:17:32 Milk or better still oil, takes heat right out

7045 2018-12-11 13:17:27 @seanhannity U are enjoying another season of top snake oil salesman...I had to laugh when you recently complained about the hate Trump media...When you & other right wing nut snake oil salesman have made a fortune out of hate Obama & Dem propaganda..,U SUCK for hurting America!!
7046 2018-12-11 13:17:21 A good alternative would be to reduces our consumption of oil altogether.
7047 2018-12-11 13:17:09 rubbing hoyt’s cologne and van van oil on my right hand before i go out to draw in good luck
7048 2018-12-11 13:16:46 you are a  - your handlers can just switch you off when oil runs low and/or electricity gets cut off
7049 2018-12-11 13:16:37 If you do it new, you can replace Automotive 30 weight oil with Diesel high detergent oil of the same weight. If you drive with regular oil and switch, you may destroy your engine. Like Synthetics
7050 2018-12-11 13:16:34 Saw a cooking video speaking about the subject. It said that, while palm oil is a major cause of deforestation, palm trees have such a high oil output that simply replacing it by another type of oleaginous would causes much more deforestation.
7051 2018-12-11 13:16:14 This time last year, @togunjobiTVC was on the road about this "oil marketers" issue still  things HAVE NOT changed!. Only in Nigeria! @K_AdurojaTVC @tvcnewsng
7052 2018-12-11 13:16:08 Domestic developments and a likely move higher in oil keep us more cautious on INR for now though we remain medium term bullish. We stay bullish on EUR, with today's German ZEW survey potentially providing the catalyst for it to break higher.
7053 2018-12-11 13:15:51 เปิดรอละจ๊ะ
7054 2018-12-11 13:15:45 Looks like willful distortion/misinterpretation to me. Counting contributions from individuals in "oil and gas" as "sponsored by fossil fuel" is just pathetic. If I work for Exxon and give 28 bucks as an individual contribution I am not an indicator that Beto is bought by Exxon

7057 2018-12-11 13:15:38 They have taken control of our Oil stocks...Communism comes to mind,Very dangerous EU...And a new law for every EU Citizen we cannot write this or talk anything bad about the EU or we will be arrested thats how Nazi Germany started be Very afraid read and learn EU IS EVIL.
7058 2018-12-11 13:15:36 @realDonaldTrump Good Morning Mr President Praying for a successful and easy day for you. Thank you for making us oil independent and freeing us from the shackles of other nations. Now let's get free from the shackles of our socialist, communist, thieving politicians. God Bless!
7059 2018-12-11 13:15:28 The US is no longer dependent on foriegn oil! First time since 1943! THANKS TRUMP

7061 2018-12-11 13:15:07 Actually Trump didn’t say he was responsible he just said for the first time in years and years we are not dependent on foreign oil.
7062 2018-12-11 13:15:00 We are aware of reports of diesel oil on the River Dane in Congleton, #Cheshire. #TeamEA are currently on route to investigate and we will keep you updated.

7064 2018-12-11 13:14:56 This is basic high school science. Crude oil goes thru a distillation process.
7065 2018-12-11 13:14:52 The oil will dry up soon
7066 2018-12-11 13:14:52 Had a beat up oil filter sent to me and @AdvanceAuto fixed my issue with no problem. They sent me a new one within just two days. 10/10 service.
7067 2018-12-11 13:14:46 The weakening outlook for oil consumption coupled with rising output from U.S. shale and softer than expected U.S. sanctions on Iran have convinced most traders the market is moving into a period of oversupply.

7080 2018-12-11 13:13:36 The sooner we admit its a debate fuelled on both sides by sentiment and emotion the sooner we can settle the issue. Only a minority of people will ever actually be moved by arguments over the Barnett Formula and oil revenues.

7089 2018-12-11 13:12:49 Because the answer is glaringly simple..we will be using whichever currency rUK wishes to pay us in, for our water, energy and oil?
7090 2018-12-11 13:12:34 Yes! I have no problem asking medical office staff to turn down/ off TVs. I ask my oil change place to do the same. I sure as hell would not be a captive customer anywhere that forces annoying music on me! Tell that driver you are working while riding, and music is interfering.
7091 2018-12-11 13:12:23 Yeah synthetic oil change is $80. I have no idea why.
7092 2018-12-11 13:12:10 Rupee ended weaker against the US Dollar Trade volumes remained muted. A slight rise in crude oil prices, Dollar buys from importers and foreign banks kept the sentiment lower. The Rupee ended at 71.87 vs. previous close of 71.34.
7093 2018-12-11 13:12:06 I agree aswell. But are Ethiopia gonna let that amount of Oil go
7094 2018-12-11 13:11:58 Deep state bs. Oh now they’re fine in the most oil in the world right here in the US. But it’s too late even if gas goes down to $.50 ain’t nobody want their wife going to a gas station and put it in flammable liquid in their car to make it go
7095 2018-12-11 13:11:44 That coffee and coconut oil scrub got me smelling and tasting like a whole damn snack

7097 2018-12-11 13:11:26 And all it cost was one assassinated, dismembered journalist who once criticized the giant orange cancer in the WH. What's one life when you get better oil prices, right Rick? I hope selling your soul was worth it.
7098 2018-12-11 13:11:25 Oil leak could be a poor seal on the sump plug

7100 2018-12-11 13:11:19 Once the Saudi's kill the undesirables off or control the country they'll have a bread basket to grow the food they need for their burgeoning populace that would starve because the oil money eventually runs out. Once that's gone the country is gone.
7101 2018-12-11 13:11:18 Alberta needs to reduce the amount of money they send to The feds. If the resources in Alberta are “owned by Albertains” then every Albertain should get a check from the Alberta government instead. Cut the amount of Oil going to BC for what they are doing also.

7113 2018-12-11 13:09:49 Fine for the majority. There's some trouble from Trump's buddy Putin encouraging people to riot over the prices of oil, but nothing they can't handle, and certainly nothing to do with walls.

7115 2018-12-11 13:09:44 @dpradhanbjp INDIA is third largest consumer of energy after US and China. India will see an investment of about USD 300 billion over the next decade in setting up of refineries, oil and gas pipelines and expansion of city gas distribution network as it builds infrastructure.

7117 2018-12-11 13:09:35 The aches & pains of old age worsen as winter comes. You keep wintergreen leaves in the kitchen; the aroma masks the damp creeping in through the pantry.

7131 2018-12-11 13:07:55 That is a silly conspiracy theory tendered by Bernie supporters in bad faith. The oil and gas industries employ many thousands of people in Texas. Surely some of them must be Democrats. Also, some of them who are GOP-leaning may (like so many others) really dislike Ted Cruz.
7132 2018-12-11 13:07:41 Drill we want cheap gas prices and the oil revenues to the residents

7136 2018-12-11 13:07:28 The oil and gas we produce is sold to other countries ( to make oil companies richer) and then oil is imported from OPEC to prop up Arabian countries so our Pentagon can sell arms and ammo to create a false economy.
7137 2018-12-11 13:07:27 Mine have always been that but yeah synthetic oil with German cars.

We have other sources of oil to more than replace SA

It seems she's cleaned the engine a bit. The buildup of oil from the leaky gaskets was scrubbed off, and the engine block had a slight shine.
7145 2018-12-11 13:06:40 Rumours are that he was at the Edmonton Oil kings game as well so I think your dead on
7146 2018-12-11 13:06:36 This is the news we’ve all been waiting for. Bring on the oil and the SP will rocket! #angs

7148 2018-12-11 13:06:26 Dollar tree has a small bottle of olive oil for a buck. If you’re low on money for the next week and need olive oil you’re more than happy to pay the buck to get the oil which is definitely enough to get you to your next pay day. You’re just trying to survive till the next payday

7152 2018-12-11 13:06:17 How hard is it to even Google the companies themselves and see who they are?  Sanchez Oil and Gas has less than 500 employees, for example - in a company that small *everyone* is a "Vice President" of something.
7153 2018-12-11 13:06:13 I discovered my son has been using the argan oil I use on my hair as lube, in case you were wondering how my day is going.

7172 2018-12-11 13:03:36 - U.S. net exporting oil for the first time in 75 years = cheap gas 

- Good relationship with Saudi Arabia = cheaper gas 

- Presidential approval ratings rise on lower gas prices

#Khashoggi is the left’s pawn to create conflict with SA, raising those fuel prices to hurt Trump.

7175 2018-12-11 13:03:04 I absolutely agree. The Niger Delta's environment has largely been destroyed by oil pollution and that has in turn been fuelling social tensions.

7178 2018-12-11 13:02:55 Well said. And of course there's the plunge in oil which hasn't helped HY bonds. I'm trying to understand how much further this spread widening can go without a wave of defaults in the near term.
7179 2018-12-11 13:02:19 they might be an inflation at high price of oil production

7187 2018-12-11 13:02:00 Nor under Gaddafi it didn't, he ran the second most prosperous Country in Africa with free healthcare and education for the population before Obama decided to decimate it in order to take their oil.
7188 2018-12-11 13:01:52 Stupid man. Poverty under the 16 years of PDP is not much different with no major capital project despite huge revenue gotten from oil.

7193 2018-12-11 13:01:12 Trump wasn't in any way responsible for this.  But that's not really very important. To report the increase in oil production without mentioning the threat of climate change is wrong.  We have death coming at us like a locomotive and celebrate the locomotive's speed.
7194 2018-12-11 13:01:09 Would it be wrong to say Nigeria is a joke, In invested in some crude oil stock and before my eyes i see my money lose 50% value due to global fall in crude oil price....Why is a litre of petrol still ##145 In Nigeria? There is a gradual reduction in price here in the U.S.

7219 2018-12-11 12:58:47 OPEC countries were able to agree on a reduction in production, only the oil market reacted ambiguously to this decision. At first, energy prices began to grow actively, but towards the evening, growth was replaced by a fall. Similarly, the ruble behaved.

7223 2018-12-11 12:57:48 Pumping oil does not employ many people. In fact once the drilling is done the pumps virtually run themselves. Industry and commerce require the right resources (other than oil they have few), population centers and infrastructure. They just never reached "critical mass".
7224 2018-12-11 12:57:48 Why do you include Ontario in your anger? We receive no transfer payments, we dislike Trudeau in Ontario;our government supports and defends Alberta's oil industry; we feel the same about Quuebec and resent what the BC govt did yo you. So I'm at a loss! Inform me why the hate?
7225 2018-12-11 12:57:39 It's is sad, that for nearly my whole life time, oil has been at the center of our politics and national agenda.
7226 2018-12-11 12:57:35 2/ Trump is a strategic snake oil salesman of the utmost caliber. Trump zeroed in on GOP desires & weaknesses & schlepped together an attack that would hit GOP wherever they were vulnerable. GOP leaders, GOP Congress & GOP voters, never stood a chance w/an attack of this kind.

7228 2018-12-11 12:56:24 You know the low gas prices are nice but if you think about what's going on the oil companies are keeping prices low as they they being Trump open up more and more protected lands when they get all they think they can oil prices thus gas prices will rise wake up America

7268 2018-12-11 12:51:24 Talvez o que estivesse errado era os 90.000...
Não necessariamente deve existir uma correlação absoluta que funcione dia a dia entre as duas bolsas e oil.
Por outro lado, existe um time decay no premio que é colocado nos mercados em função de expectativas e suas frustrações.
7269 2018-12-11 12:51:13 ただあのおでんやってた店員は火に油を注ぐ反応だったな……実は前々からこのお客さんが来ていた……？だからいつものことだと慣れている……？
7270 2018-12-11 12:51:09 Do you really think that OPEC gives a crap about the environment?  If oil is not produced here it will be there.   At least here we have control over how it is produced and we can influence environmental impact. In the Middle East we have none and no way to influence it there.

7277 2018-12-11 12:50:28 つっつー!
7278 2018-12-11 12:50:22 Big oil has always been the biggest and steadiest investors in renewable energy.
7279 2018-12-11 12:50:15 接客業したことのないベイビーってクレーマーになりがちよな。
7280 2018-12-11 12:50:07 Also KSA is too important not just cause of oil, for this to have any long lasting effects on it. Al Sauds are first and foremost about securing the family, and if senior princes see this as a threat MbS will not be King. They learned their lesson with King Saud in 1953.
7281 2018-12-11 12:50:07 RT @LS_Nutrition: Treat yourself to a healthy #breakfast this December morning. Try a poached or fried egg, with some low-fat mozzarella, arugula and olive oil on a toasted whole wheat bagel. Allergens: Egg, Wheat.
7282 2018-12-11 12:50:04 She was a good nurse last night. My skin was burning so badly and I scratch so hard until I bleed, in my sleep. She put the cream and baby oil on me, and massaged my whole body. I love her so much man

7285 2018-12-11 12:49:39 There was no mention or presence of big oil, PG&E, telecommunications, lasers or any sort of weapons at this session (& the video will post soon, making it clear) It was a discussion about climate research. If you are concerned, lying about it seems counterproductive.
7286 2018-12-11 12:49:19 みんなオイルが好きだよね⁇あん⁇嫌い⁇嫌いとか言うならオイル使われてる食品も製品も食べるなよ使うなよwwwwww? ガソリンもオイルだよ⁇www 車も乗るなよwww? 野菜だけ食ってろよwwww ベジタリアンテラワロスwwwwwww
7287 2018-12-11 12:49:11 I need sleep. and peppermint oil. and sleep. and a day off. and sLEEP
7288 2018-12-11 12:49:02 Like @vegetablezealot said, palm oil is unethically made, but it is still vegan. Going by your logic literally nothing in the world is vegan because animals are harmed.
7289 2018-12-11 12:49:01 OIL 1H hesitating, but still sets up bull to test 50 & 200 MA resistances. Bullish at least for the morning. UWT?
7290 2018-12-11 12:48:59 やばｗｗ
7291 2018-12-11 12:48:46 Meaning that as far as trade goes the rUK is more beneficial graveside than the EU. Remember oil and gas is provided through private companies. The Scottish government would only receive tax on the profits which isn't that high.
7292 2018-12-11 12:48:39 Is there any fish oil in fish oil
7293 2018-12-11 12:48:38 Farmers may have his heart but oil companies have his ear
7294 2018-12-11 12:48:37 Hey Trev, Quebec doesn't import oil, private companies do. They do it to maximize profits. Hope this helps with the ignorance you display on a wide range of topics. 
7295 2018-12-11 12:48:11 And when oil and gas dies, nuclear will take over
7296 2018-12-11 12:48:10 Actual transcript of history... “let’s make this oil last 8 days so we can eat these potato pancake things for 8 days”

7302 2018-12-11 12:47:45 @EvCoRadio @Babchik BRUSSEL SPROUTS. Bacon...garlic and oil...they are awesome when burnt or sauteed
7303 2018-12-11 12:47:44 You mean leave in conditioner, curl pomade, and hair oil
7304 2018-12-11 12:47:41 I have to shave everyday. I use avocado oil instead of shaving cream though so I don’t irritate my skin.
7305 2018-12-11 12:47:36 That’s indirectly my point. SP hasn’t moved despite PoO dropping $20+. So given oil supply is still too high, if PoO falls to next level, being $45, that’s $25 profit. They will need to produce a 615bpd / 365 days to give mcap of £45m based on 8 multiple.
7306 2018-12-11 12:47:20 For all of you who wants to vote Buhari president you can't see and interact with, I hope you know we will be grounded as an entire country. Venezuela has large oil but look at them, running to other countries just to feed. Continue
7307 2018-12-11 12:47:12 Investors are acting on #climate change & integrating sustainability into their investment practices - Norwegian sovereign wealth fund should divest 100 percent from all oil & gas assets-that would be “a smart financial choice” - Ireland just divested from fossil fuels - @algore
7308 2018-12-11 12:47:02 If you put it in the fridge and it doesn’t get cloudy and gel a bit, it isn’t pure olive oil.

7317 2018-12-11 12:45:59 So what will Americans do with their monopoly money when debt bubble pops and when world countries start dumping because is not needed anymore to buy oil or settle payments? Smart people will get hard assets, gold and bitcoin. And history shows the first two can be confiscated
7318 2018-12-11 12:45:54 Not happening in the near term... and cannot tax oil.. still the cheapest form of energy...
7319 2018-12-11 12:45:53 thank you!!! its gonna be in oil pastel
7320 2018-12-11 12:45:49 The article itself also states that the campaign refunded/returned most of the larger donations from individuals in oil & gas so why are you trying to make this sound like a scandal?
7321 2018-12-11 12:45:46 Whip together 1/3 cup unicorn tears with 2 quarts hamburger . Sprinkle with Olive Oil. Freeze for 9 hours. Serve in 3 inch slices
7322 2018-12-11 12:45:29 Number1 most competitive economy. Number1 oil producer. Lowest unemployment rate. Love his "FAILURES". Haha
7323 2018-12-11 12:45:21 My 90, 3/4 ton Dodge Cummins got 22 mpg all the time. Engine wise, it was maintenance free. Although it does take 12 quarts of oil to change.
7324 2018-12-11 12:45:09 Calcium with magnesium and vitamin D, obviously vitamin C, Echinacea an Elderberry syrup.

Why if you're not...CBD oil!
7325 2018-12-11 12:45:02 Remember change the oil, fuel, transmission & air filters. They are important to preserve the engine #CarMaintenanceTips @alatishe2 pls #RT

7329 2018-12-11 12:44:43 last night i put oil and baby powder over 90% of my body before taking a shower and i unironically recommend doing it
7330 2018-12-11 12:44:39 Rice , oil have got more expensive. Yeh bbi aam awaam nai use kerti.
7331 2018-12-11 12:44:32 See my tweets today about BIg Oil, telecoms and laser weapons lobbying Congress YESTERDAY w newly minted fake NGOs for MORE SRM spraying. Agenda is now revealed. SRM for climate is a cover story.  Rep McNerney who convened AFTER FIRES needs to LOSE his seat, California.
7332 2018-12-11 12:44:23 It reads like a general (perhaps vague) set of promises on needing strong investment in jobs etc which the bits that make it sound like he’s committing to *just* oil jobs have been lifted out and overstretched. But that’s just having read that piece.
7333 2018-12-11 12:44:20 Coconut oil is the best anal lube also
7334 2018-12-11 12:44:14 That’s cassava in red oil
7335 2018-12-11 12:44:13 The process,needs and use of crude oil in industrial manufacturing is enormous!Fuels are just portions and with research as time and working activities;not carry go home,hopefully solutions lies ahead.
7336 2018-12-11 12:44:11 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
7337 2018-12-11 12:44:11 It's actually 59billion to rUK but 29.8% of that was oil and gas. I doubt that would change very much and that doesn't include the renewable energy we sell to rUK which would also be unlikely to change due to the nature of supply. I do have my facts correct
7338 2018-12-11 12:44:06 Your comment makes no sense Bradley. If OPEC drives the bus and opec needs $70 oil to fund their countries then now is the time to be long.
7339 2018-12-11 12:44:02 Bang..dah lama harga statik RM 2.20 tanpa ambil kira harga crude oil dunia..bila agaknya nak turun seposen dua..aritu ada juga naik turun..guna mekanisme APM..skrg..guna mekanisme apa

Very interesting upside oil and gas plays from these levels. 
Take a look dyor.
7342 2018-12-11 12:43:57 Oil sands aren’t even a GDP driver in Canada, and never have been. Kids were going hungry while that sector was at its peak when the Conservatives were busy giving people tax breaks instead of being fiscally responsible.

7344 2018-12-11 12:43:51 Shell are not very proficient in many ways but from personal experience I have worked in the Niger Delta and several times the local militants have maliciously caused oil spill pollution purely to get monetary compensation from whoever is in the client
7345 2018-12-11 12:43:43 Ladies remember to change your oil
7346 2018-12-11 12:43:34 If only one of these eagles had been killed on an oil drilling site, hundreds of eco-warriors would show up for the protests.

Oil projects much better for environment.

7351 2018-12-11 12:43:11 Grab a few toilet seat covers to cut up into 2-inch squares. These are great for soaking up excess oil on your face.
7352 2018-12-11 12:43:06 The std of living in Scotland has always been like this long before devolution & is nothing to do with the SNP or Sturgeon. A lot to do with oil industry & lower population density. I underrstand why the thought of independence appears appealing but it would hurt us.
7353 2018-12-11 12:42:52 Safer still: transition away from oil, and save the humans.
7354 2018-12-11 12:42:48 You missed the Eisenhower dip...Kennedy had to deal with it.  

Nixon allowed a fake oil crisis drive a bad economy that Carter could not solve.
7355 2018-12-11 12:42:34 Farm subsidies!  Oil subsidies!  Reverse mortgages! Flood insurance!  Payments to farmers to make up for trump’s tariffs! Medicare!  Social security disability payments that make it possible for poor whites in Appalachia to survive! This is socialism in America, Bubba!
7356 2018-12-11 12:42:33 The fish oil teen sex crisis is awful.
7357 2018-12-11 12:42:20 you don’t have a clue the world is hungry for oil the 3rd world is just beginning its industrial revolution . The reason Iverson is mayor again is because this city is full of socialist trolls like yourself and nobody ran against him . You don’t speak for the rest of Canada .

7361 2018-12-11 12:42:07 1% of Beto’s overall fundraising came from “people from Oil & Gas,” sure feels a lot different than others that take huge chunks of their overall campaign contributions from Oil & Gas Companies. Is this a mountain or a mole hill?

7367 2018-12-11 12:41:12 Simply empty the treasury.  Give freebies.  Issue oil bonds and slash petrol & diesel prices.  Slash IT exemption limit. Waive all farm loans rather all luabs.  Make everybody happy. Ok et the economy and country go to dogs like Congis did during their 10 years regime.
7368 2018-12-11 12:41:11 That, but moreso that without oil money their economy collapses.
7369 2018-12-11 12:40:43 Oil is none essential, that land could of been used for essential food crops preventing deforestation elsewhere. By discouraging palm oil but not other oils you are effectively advocating for more deforestation elsewhere as palm is the most efficient oil crop.
7370 2018-12-11 12:40:34 You may not have noticed, but many Albertans are at work, and Alberta’s economy is growing nicely. That doesn’t address the continuing difficulties in the oil patch, but the problems there can’t be solved with a magic wand. There are plenty of good reasons not to subvert...

7384 2018-12-11 12:39:35 Wait, that's *it*? This is what Sirota is foaming at the mouth over? A few donations in the $1000 range? One of them is for $375. Yup, definitely in the pocket of big oil there.

7392 2018-12-11 12:38:41 Do so, you have nothing to provide but wait what will happen if you have no one to sell oil 
7393 2018-12-11 12:38:37 The question is what for? The control of oil throughout Europe and Asia?
That would mean he's going to have to do more to secure what he gains.

7398 2018-12-11 12:37:15 Well, it must be because islam is religion of peace thus they value peace more than oil, do I get the first price ?

7403 2018-12-11 12:36:30 Prostate cancer is caused by eating animals and their products and junk food and oil. Turn your lives around and go whole plant food and fruit and raw nuts and seeds. i.e. Dr. Greger, Dr. Joel Fuhrman, Dr. Eselstyn, Dr. Ornish, Dr. Klapper, Dr. T Collin Campbell. Say no to cancer
7404 2018-12-11 12:36:29 The ppl who translated the Bible into native languages misled us. Natives understood Genesis 1:28 to be saying we should have many kids. In English it says be fruitful (produce a product), multiply it, replenish it & subdue. E.g McDonald's bugger, Oil, Ford, BMW, Gold, Diamonds
7405 2018-12-11 12:36:29 You know your precious "white working class" work for oil companies, right? Also coal companies, car manufacturers, meat packing plants, steel companies...all those big pollution generators. This is your strategy to tell them how you're on their side?

7408 2018-12-11 12:36:24 Countries without crude oil function and the point you are missing here is that apart from the GDP growing at a decreasing rate, the economy has not been stimulated for growth, thus the kinetics are gradually stifling the economy.

7414 2018-12-11 12:35:55 I've used the Weber ones for burgers and sliders, a stuffz one and a ring mold. Find them all to be annoying as the meat gets stuck, even with oil or paper. I'm a fan of hand forming.

7419 2018-12-11 12:35:31 Great advice! My problem is I'm a big foodie, and being desi means that most of our food uses oil and of course various types of bread! I need to work out a proper plan and stick to it.

7426 2018-12-11 12:35:00 Fucks sake .. Im not a neo liberal. But you're as thick as marmite in a oil slick it seems
7427 2018-12-11 12:34:55 That didn't answer my question. Pumping oil out of the ground doesn't create greenhouse gases. How it is used by the general public creates greenhouse gases.
7428 2018-12-11 12:34:53 Oil from Angola isn't damaging to vehicles sweetheart, and vehicle owners don't owe service stations anything, yes, it's advisable to use an extra filter to when fueling...

7479 2018-12-11 12:29:21 Exactly.  The terms “oil” and “natural gas” no longer describe the complex supply demand scenarios of distinct components.

7488 2018-12-11 12:28:13 I can tell, did the olive oil help?
7489 2018-12-11 12:28:08 They got rich recently by selling oil, and some have taken the long view. But don't confuse an oil boom from the 60s/70s with having produced knowledge. From the 1100s to now, they produced almost no knowledge, because they discarded the idea of logic.
7490 2018-12-11 12:28:03 So much for those working class voters I guess, right?  You know, the ones who work for oil companies, coal companies, auto manufacturers...all those people working for those industries you hate so much. You don't want their votes after all?

7513 2018-12-11 12:26:08 My point still stands, you just haven't figured out what it was.

 I'm not the one saying vegans MUST be Whole Food PlantBased, Oil Free, Avocado Free, Broccoli Free, Nut Free, only buying from Veganic Farm shops. 

I asked you a question who looks like a crazy vegan here?
7514 2018-12-11 12:26:03 its for no other reason than the USA want their oil. the mainstream media are in on it too, painting maduro as a hated monster when he has the support of his people. They have done the same to Putin and And Assad when both of those are loved by their people for standing up 2 #NWO
7515 2018-12-11 12:26:02 Plus the worry should be whether or not oil and gas is an influence on Beto, Sorry..but honestly 20K (that was probably returned) does not look like buying influence, rather actblue accepting money from random managers that want to give to Beto

7530 2018-12-11 12:24:29 oil = stick
7531 2018-12-11 12:24:26 I think her point is that palm oil is not an animal product and therefore by definition is a vegan product. The sourcing of the product is not vegan due to the way humans obtain it.
7532 2018-12-11 12:24:14 It starts with a plan to transition that does not destroy families and communities.  I dare you to drop everything oil related out of your life.
7533 2018-12-11 12:24:07 We burned coal until the mid-60s and we finally got electricity in '65 or so.  Dad converted to oil.  Still only had the kitchen oil stove as primary heat source until '69 when we had a floor furnace installed.  #cold ;-)

7538 2018-12-11 12:23:27 ...Prior to OBJ's government, there was almost zero foreign direct investment in the Nigerian economy beyond the oil and gas sector. 
He secured an $18 billion debt relief from the Paris and London clubs and got Nigeria free of debt by paying some of what we owe.
7539 2018-12-11 12:23:22 3-mnths ago I gained guardianship to a group of little persons (10, 11, 14, 16 & 17).

7550 2018-12-11 12:22:15 After answering spm paper chemistry, i finally got the correlation why people don't use corn oil to deep frying although its healthier than kelapa sawit oil
7551 2018-12-11 12:22:14 Yes, empty the treasury.  Do what Congis did to the economy except swindling people's money bey.  Issue oil bonds and subsidise heavily petrol and diesel. Increase income-tax exemption limit.  If they have to go, leave the economy like the one they inherited from MMS.

7567 2018-12-11 12:20:22 Hombre soy joven, pero empecé pronto jajaja (con 10 años aprox). Mi jefe que sí que peina canas siempre dice q lleva muchos años escuchando la misma cantinela. Recuerdo la época en la que Goldman estaba a tope con el oil y cotizaba >100usd (creo q por 2010) tb se decía lo mismo.
7568 2018-12-11 12:20:14 Can’t believe “news” agencies aren’t reporting the fact that we now are not importing any oil from other countries. We now export more than almost any country. Thank you president Trump

7574 2018-12-11 12:19:35 Better yet. Quebec has no problem saying no to so called dirty oil from the west but has no problem saying yes to dirty oil from OPEC and their lack of environmental and labour laws!
7575 2018-12-11 12:19:27 The Republican party was taken over by libertarian ideologues over a thirty year period - combination of McGill Buchanan snake oil economics and Koch Brothers money. The main tactic is huge funding but deployed by stealth via anonymous groups -its happening here via Tufton Street
7576 2018-12-11 12:19:14 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
7577 2018-12-11 12:19:11 How come you can’t answer simple questions?  I asked if you think we should stop buying their oil.  Yes or no.  50 words in that response when only 1 was needed to answer the question.
7578 2018-12-11 12:18:50 FFS taking an individual donation from someone who works for an oil company is different than taking donations from oil companies. And the idea that only CEOs can make a donation over $200 is just stupid. Bernie Bros are obviously worried about Beto.

7590 2018-12-11 12:16:51 I prefer the oil with the THC still in it.
7591 2018-12-11 12:16:32 OMG. You need to check out these 2 vids (when you get the ipad back)- the history of oil and south african braai etiquette. Hilarious!!
7592 2018-12-11 12:16:20 If I'm waiting for anything (in vain), I suppose it's for a shift in public interest. The politician's job is to mediate competing interests. If Big Oil are chapping their doors threatening redundancies and few talk to them about climate change, it's easy to see how that resolves
7593 2018-12-11 12:16:16 I reckon 5 yrs left on oil you’ll be fine apart from the monkey +a yr rfl it’ll see what vehicles are capable of and what direction the trades heading but I’m not sure I’ll be allowed to rattle around in 2027!

7595 2018-12-11 12:16:09 No one wants open borders, and there's no threat of crime and disease, except in the fantasy world manufactured by you and your cheerleaders at #FoxNews. We need real leadership on #Immigration, and not the snake oil that you're trying to sell.
7596 2018-12-11 12:16:02 Fed hikes, February sell-offs, October worst month since 2008, 14% of the S&500 companies can't service their debt with 3y of EBITDA, 1/3 of the Russell 3000 companies don't make money, huge debt, deficits, high taxes, oil crashing, trade war, Brexit, French rioting, want more?

7598 2018-12-11 12:15:48 So basically Russia is gonna escort oil tankers with bombers, through its friends in the South China Sea, & if the USA is aggressive over it?....
7599 2018-12-11 12:15:43 As for "trying to prove how shitty scientists are," they're not shitty, they're people, just like "oil shills."  They're my friends and colleagues.

Let me offer a touch of advice, you should learn a little bit more about "science" before you put so much faith in it.
7600 2018-12-11 12:15:39 Quite simply we should be advocating the production of sustainable palm oil.
7601 2018-12-11 12:15:38 So you're not oil free then.
7602 2018-12-11 12:15:24 Whilst I Totally agree with you What are your intentions, How do you intend to debate that Oil & Gas come to a rapid end   Do I hear Hydrogen  Sorry to braek this gently But You, Greens LD Greenpeace all the same Anti know what the issues are  But NO answer
7603 2018-12-11 12:15:24 To some, the entire world is about their own oil and gas investments. There are more important things in the world, and climate change is a big one. - #climatechange #sciencematters
7604 2018-12-11 12:15:18 There’s 2 issues being confused here- ethical & vegan- they don’t always come hand in hand unfortunately as much as we’d like them to but one does not negate the other. Palm oil isn’t good but the production of its equivalents, like rapeseed, actually cause far more damage.

7608 2018-12-11 12:14:53 Oil tankers cruise up the St. Lawrence regularly delivering foreign oil to Quebec. Tie with BC for worst Canadian hypocrites.

*Contractors giving VP Spiro Agnew campaign contributions 

*Pres. of Mammoth Oil paying Interior Secretary Albert Fall $300,000 for Teapot Dome contract.

others examples?
7630 2018-12-11 12:12:09 Hi there, since 2015, we have sourced 100% of our palm oil for our own-label food products from sustainable RSPO-certified sources. We are on track to ensure that 100% of palm oil for our own brand non-food products is sourced from RSPO certified sources by the end of 2018.

7632 2018-12-11 12:11:37 For the first time in 75 years the US is not dependent on Foreign Oil.
7633 2018-12-11 12:11:36 Sorry missed this. Andrew Scheer was saying that there is a double standard for Cdn oil where we apply higher regulatory standards for their transport. Why Irving’s refine foreign vs Cdn is best be answered by them; I believe largely they don’t have a pipeline to assure supply.
7634 2018-12-11 12:11:31 Oil production colapse is not the only reason.... that's a oversimplification.

7681 2018-12-11 12:06:40 Did you even read that??? It said it was working toward trying to find alternatives & that “eating wheat, oil palm, etc. causes LESS harm to animals than eating them.” It doesn’t eliminate it. Lol. Girl, bye.

7702 2018-12-11 12:03:02 Exactly reason why Canada is broke. Being discussed more & more - I see no downside. 

Alberts would immediately become one of the wealthiest nations on earth with high skilled workforce, great schools & healthcare. Likely no need for taxes.

Canada can buy oil which sold in USD
7703 2018-12-11 12:02:59 so will they stop crying about how little oil they can afford? (with their Ferrari....)

7707 2018-12-11 12:02:19 oil prices ticked higher ahead of the release of fresh weekly data on U.S. commercial crude inventories. On the data front, today's calendar will bring investors the November report on producer prices at 8:30AM ET which should give clearer signs on the pace of inflation.

7715 2018-12-11 12:00:49 @SecPompeo Do a nation's natural resources belong to only a few?

7730 2018-12-11 11:59:07 Their reliance on oil largely has to do with government decision making to use oil as a means to fund their socialist agenda and micromanage the economy. So the root of their issue dates back to socialism and big government. That's why people reject the idea. It failed.
7731 2018-12-11 11:58:55 Say that to the oil patch workers out of a job. Say “ go back to school, work harder, and you’ll be ok “
7732 2018-12-11 11:58:34 Inflation depends upon transportation cost which further depends upon oil prices. BJP govt was lucky to be in power when international oil prices were all time low. Its not an achievement. 
Emergency witnessed no massacre.

7741 2018-12-11 11:57:33 You’re wrong there because veganism isn’t about just diet. It’s about lifestyle & by eating palm oil, you’re openly saying, “I don’t care about what happens to the animals that lost their homes & died due to starvation, it’s still vegan tho.”

7832 2018-12-11 11:48:54 So let me get this straight: "oil shills" are not credible because of their greed, but scientists, whose funding depends upon global warming research are above the profit motive?

I think you need to meet more researchers.

7837 2018-12-11 11:48:33 Scotland has a £13bn deficit due to a higher spend per person than other regions. about £1600 per person higher. Free prescriptions, no tuition fees, better NHS / schools. Tax revs from oil plummeted, which was the basis for independence. Scotland does far better than rest of UK.

7842 2018-12-11 11:47:02 Everything in life is a trade off.  I consider scientists laboring within the peer-reviewed scientific method credible.  Oil and coal industry shills are not.  Their loyalty is to a paycheck, not rigorous truth and fact seeking.

7855 2018-12-11 11:44:45 Our country for the first time since 1949 exports more oil than we import.  Its a beautiful thing.  So glad to not have Obama as president.
7856 2018-12-11 11:44:25 Carbon tax blames consumers for climate change. Nice try. Impact owners of the system- tax gas and oil at point of extraction. Fixing leaky pipelines will be incentivized. Throw in a methane tax and pipeline insurance requirements. Time to get serious.

2) Among all the oil producing Nations Nigeria petrol still rank one of the cheapest.
Pls Sir, crosscheck before you reply

7878 2018-12-11 11:42:09 No basis to expect devaluation in the Naira any moment soon. Rising reserves, growing GDP, falling imports, fairly stable oil prices, PMB’s aversion to devaluation.......Nigeria banks $ denominated debts are in Upstream Oil, Telcom and Power. Little appetite for these

8021 2018-12-11 11:21:59 Oh yes you have. You've been heavily dependent on foreign oil for 75 years. Until now. Recent oil discoveries in the Permian Basin between TX & NM will allow you to become oil independent for the first time in ages. Dakota pipeline will help 
8022 2018-12-11 11:21:27 To the contrary it is much easier to build EV cars with existing lines because the engine is much much simpler and do not require so many hoses and screws what not. Instead of very complex water-oil-eletric-gasoline-engine you have much simpler cylindrical oil-electric-engine.

Only trees which stand acid soil now have a chance in the East.

8030 2018-12-11 11:20:29 Hence why I said several decades because most of our politicians and municipalities are either in the pocket or at the mercy of big oil. However, it's not impossible to think it can't be done, when countries like Costa Rica spent the last 300 days on just renewable sources.

8098 2018-12-11 11:11:15 As you know Indian oil imports is around 80%.So when US put sanctions on Iran in somewhere in 2012-13, oil headed to north, Rs depreciated significantly these were the reason but current scenario is different if now we are not able to deliver then it will be a disaster in future.

8110 2018-12-11 11:09:13 7# The current condition of world crude oil supplies is also feared to be disrupted due to two things: the planned implementation of US sanctions on Iran and Venezuela's oil production which has dropped drastically to 50 percent.

8112 2018-12-11 11:08:51 I think that is the issue is it not? With Trudeau shutting down the oil sector they are struggling to look after their citizens. Quebec wants to take a high and mighty attitude about the oil industry but still is happy to demand the money that results from it.

8166 2018-12-11 11:00:13 I think you are absolutely right - we need to look at this economy that hums by the destruction of our land and earth. Drilling on OUR land for oil that’s killing us? How about the infrastructure? Converting to clean energy?
8167 2018-12-11 11:00:13 COOKING TIP: Tenderize meat by using vinegar and olive oil, rub both sides and let it set for at least two hours before cooking.

8243 2018-12-11 10:49:38 1. U.S. is energy independent for the first time in 70 yrs. 2. huge oil discovery in west texas and new mexico. 3. oil output continues to increase. 4. we have made OPEC almost irrelevant.
8244 2018-12-11 10:49:30 Remember, taxes go to pay for govt bonds, which are govt borrowed funds from the RBA, they don't go to pay for govt services. Meanwhile govt is giving away Aust's wealth of natural resources to foreign corps: (for free) oil & gas, (for peanuts) metals & produce. It's sickening.

8251 2018-12-11 10:47:46 Hi Jan, Neon have advised 'Neom products are based on aromatherapy so the smell having an impact on your feelings / emotion. The candle and pillow mist are based purely on scent however the face oil and hand balm have amazing ‘skin’ benefits.' Hope this helps, Rebecca x

8259 2018-12-11 10:46:42 Interesting to see what works will appear on the back of the EV revolution. I’m sure Dealers will try and have a angle. Maybe a £100 battery check up every year that involves a guy to sit all of two minutes to plug a computer in Battery oil change, Battery coolant flushing

8277 2018-12-11 10:43:34 All those weird and wonderful creatures are there for a reason. When evolution of our planet started gas and oil is there to stabilise the earth. It helps keep the world revolving and on course it isn't for mans greed. No wonder our weather patterns around the world have changed.

8279 2018-12-11 10:43:20 TAKING A SHORT BREAK
I am taking a few weeks off to visit family and friends in New Zealand (including a side trip to Stewart Island). 
Digitally disconnecting. No email. No news. No Twitter. No oil prices. Even books I’m taking  have nothing to do with energy.

8311 2018-12-11 10:38:27 Depends on grade, problem is supply consistency & emissions. Many plastics can now be converted back to oil & re-fracked for reuse. Probably better to convert it to insulation material or use it in paving aggregate & other building materials as they do to a degree in Japan & US.

8313 2018-12-11 10:38:14 No doubt it is a triumph of marketing though Hat's off to them for that. But there are far, far better sauces out there. My top three (in no particular order): Encona, Tropical Sun Scotch Bonnet, Laoganma crispy chilli oil
8314 2018-12-11 10:38:12 No country is socialist unless the state owns 1 or more key profit-making industries...such as oil in Venezuela. Most European countries are market economies, who also happen to provide a number of extra services to citizens (from higher taxes).

8322 2018-12-11 10:37:42 Would have loved Egbon to say why we don't have cheaper petrol? Food prices on the high? Amongst others. First and foremost most GCC which are oil producers withdrew subsidy since Jan 2016 and new month new pump price close to 100% to what it used to be. Are we prepared for that?

8326 2018-12-11 10:37:07 The oil crisis in the Middle East due to the wars there etc, led the US to pursue shale, and fracking... Which has made the US the biggest green house gas REDUCTION country in the world, due to switching from coal to gas.  So I heard yesterday.  Funny.

 Separate one egg yolk in a bowl, then blend 2 teaspoons of coconut oil, 1 teaspoon of olive oil and 1 teaspoon of honey until combined. Apply to your face for 15 minutes. Then wash with your regular cleanser to remove.
8332 2018-12-11 10:36:46 #ukog @davidlenigas I doubt it will remain the 2nd largest inland oil well for long. I suspect bigger and  better things to come.
8333 2018-12-11 10:36:42 Yes! A drizzle of raw coconut oil takes it to another level altogether
8334 2018-12-11 10:36:35 If so who’ll improve on alternatives, govt. or industry? That’s where the market comes to play. 
There are theories that oil is not a fossil fuel because it’s being found at debts greater than fossils are found. If so industry will reach it.

Labour are a nationalist, centralising, unsustainable infinite growth party.
They claim to accept that we are in planetary overshoot, but the evidence shows they refuse to accept the implications (e.g. supporting Hinkley, HS2, Heathrow expansion, North Sea oil and gas etc)
8336 2018-12-11 10:35:56 You are too right. We would LOVE Scotland to piss off and be independent. They wil! soon be back with their begging bowls. Oil price has dropped again.

8367 2018-12-11 10:29:19 Good luck to you with that Scotland. The EU don't want you and, quite frankly, neither do we. Many were very disappointed that you voted to remain. Would have great to see Scotland getting no money from England and struggling to survive when the oil price dropped. Great fun.

8382 2018-12-11 10:27:38 You don't seem to understand the difference between a private company and a public. The Irving's are a private wood/oil company that rips our province off and fucks over small businesses. Now Alberta wants to bring their oil here... can you maybe see why we dont trust them.

8390 2018-12-11 10:26:05 I think about how the UAE discovered oil after Nigeria did and are somehow 100 years ahead in terms of development and infrastructure and it just makes me wonder if there was any need for us to even discover oil. All that has done is enable more looting and fraudulence.
8391 2018-12-11 10:26:05 The oil spills were an environmental catastrophe, not just for Lebanon but the Eastern Mediterranean sea. Oil extended nearly 3,100 square kilometers shortly after the spill, and then sank to the sea bottom covering an expanse of 50,000 square meters
8392 2018-12-11 10:25:49 So sorry to @LNRailway customers impacted by our engineering work over-run this morning between #Euston and #Watford 

The delay was caused by a burst hydraulic hose sending 100 litres of oil on to the tracks at #Kenton - for safety reasons we had to clean it up
8393 2018-12-11 10:25:44 No he did not.  @davidsirota was inferring he did because INDIVIDUALS who work in Oil and Gas (Texas you know) made INDIVIDUAL donations.

8398 2018-12-11 10:24:48 Again we didnt build a pipeline because the price of oil bombed, and yeah the Irving's buy Saudi oil, and they would continue to unless they got a huge discount on Alberta oil. They pay 1/3rd of what an Alberta refinery pays on theirs.

8458 2018-12-11 10:15:55 The best course of action would be to license drilling for palm oil as the license fees would cover the costs of building the houses , it saves the rainforest and so no need to battery farm orangutans . SIMPLES .

8467 2018-12-11 10:14:46 I don't agree with Quebec and I think they should make better use of the resources but Alberta has fiscall capacity that they don't use.. Energy East was not intended to replace foreign oil it's for export only. But I see no reason to oppose that pipeline.

8473 2018-12-11 10:14:29 Thank you. Big difference is Alberta has bitumen, Texas has oil. The other, well, they selected certain years to emphasize their point. Doesn't show truths such as oil dropping. Instead, labels it as Trudeau's fault. Tarsands high cost and pipeline blocks not mentioned.
8474 2018-12-11 10:14:29 Serious question - we don’t buy oil from Saudi Arabia. Why are they an “energy ally” ? They run a cartel to make sure oil prices are high. What is our end of the bargain? They refuse to station our troops in their country.
8475 2018-12-11 10:14:28 This isn't about oil prices so much as corporate control over huge long term oil and gas reserves. Some of which impinge on Dutch regional infrastructure interests and Guyanan territorial claims

8479 2018-12-11 10:14:06 It's sad that we rely on palm oil so much:( mostly because the harvest is destroying habitats for plants and animals. I wonder if we could somehow replace it with something like olive or sunflower oil??? Not sure what properties they have but that would be ideal.

8482 2018-12-11 10:12:43 It says exactly the opposite... Maintening aging facilities and not starting a new series, based on the fallacious fact that the price of the EPR will stay the same if you build manies instead of one. Are you a Russian troll out something ? Trying to sell us oil???

8503 2018-12-11 10:09:20 Absolutely. That means oil is abiotic chemistry contaminated by biology, and not vice versa. (Btw, Gold was my academic great-grandfather.)
8504 2018-12-11 10:09:11 Definitely, previous deals & contracts were injustice, & genuine negotiations on mgt & coordination, revenue & profits, profit taxes, health & environmental risks, socio-economic &other issues are needed.

8523 2018-12-11 10:07:45 I think in general customers should have  choice.. As someone who after surgery utilized oil to get pain relief and sleep instead of the opioids I was originally prescribed,  I tried vaping and smoking.The effects are different than oil and I preferred the oil.

8527 2018-12-11 10:07:21 The story is usually far better than the reality - same with most of the popular oil shares back on 2010, but getting to production is a different story. With EUZ it doesn’t even look that good on paper though so far!
8528 2018-12-11 10:07:14 True. And I guess he doesn’t have USSR’s foreign aid capacity. But would he like to get oil prices back up again? @APHClarkson
8529 2018-12-11 10:07:12 Oil slid to its worst loss in 2 weeks at 3.1% as investor doubts grew about whether OPEC & its allies can actually deliver enough output cuts to head off a supply glut.

8531 2018-12-11 10:06:51 Secretary Pompeo its more focused on the oil reserves.   Military assets are in place given stesses to financial and feo political spheres currently.  Venezuela has largest reserves of oil in the world.  Strategically a key sovereign nation given the oil during a global 'crisis'.
8532 2018-12-11 10:06:47 Then the oil nation have bogus reserves are unprepared...  Don't settle for mediocre

8551 2018-12-11 10:03:59 (3/3) & shift biodiversity loss to other crops that do not give anywhere near the same high yield (palm oil uses up to 10x less land than alternatives).

8558 2018-12-11 10:02:24 Hedge funds increased wagers against rising Brent crude prices for a 10th straight week & cut bullish bets on U.S. oil to the lowest in almost 6 years. Then Friday,OPEC & its allies surprised market with a bigger-than-expected cut of 1.2M bpd. Investors are now seeking direction
8559 2018-12-11 10:02:19 If oil ever rebounds yes.. The price action for now is just the worst possible.
8560 2018-12-11 10:02:17 (2/3) Having explored all viable alternatives, we continue to use a minimal amount of 100% fully segregated/fully sustainable RSPO-certified palm oil in our pie lids (less than 2% of the product). As Greenpeace says, to boycott palm oil will only displace the issue...
8561 2018-12-11 10:02:00 Definitely. Let’s talk about this IRL. Twitter doesn’t allow for nuance
8562 2018-12-11 10:01:50 ...I have 6 pillows that all have matching pillow cases to the multiple comforter sets for my king size bed. And I dab essential oil on the pillows for when a young lady stays over for the night. I have multiple matching wash cloth (not rag) and towel sets...
8563 2018-12-11 10:01:48 So sorry to @VirginTrains customers impacted by our engineering work over-run this morning between #Euston and #Watford 

The delay was caused by a burst hydraulic hose sending 100 litres of oil on to the tracks at #Kenton - for safety reasons we had to clean it up
8564 2018-12-11 10:01:29 (1/3) Hi @EadieCat, we only use a minimal amount of sustainable palm oil in our pies. In line with leading environmentalists, like @GreenpeaceUK, we believe that it’s important to support those committed to growing Palm Oil in an environmentally & socially responsible manner.

8577 2018-12-11 09:58:47 Don't add oil to anything you boil in water though (rice, pasta, potatoes). Usually prevents whatever you're boiling from adhering to the sauce.

8582 2018-12-11 09:57:28 Let's pose that question to the 80 million Iranians reeling from US sanctions though they are oil rich and have one of the world's oldest civilisations. After thousands of years, why are they suddenly made impotent by seemingly ineffective sanctions? Where's their spirit??
8583 2018-12-11 09:56:53 Twisties were my my perfect food of choice until I found out that @PepsiCo use uncertified palm oil. Ridiculous for a food company of that size to not source ethical ingredients....

8585 2018-12-11 09:56:14 Malaysian Prime Minister said in a speech inaugurating the project that the Biodiesel project is a combination of 10% of palm oil biodiesel and 90% fossil diesel, which will reduce 10% of CO 2 emissions from total motor vehicles diesel in the country. #QNA
8586 2018-12-11 09:56:09 This is an awful, backwards suggestion. We need for the oil&gas sectors to transition to other energy forms urgently, the skills are, with support and training, transferable and we clearly see opportunities in the renewables sector. Wake tfu people.
8587 2018-12-11 09:56:00 If I recall the Gamecube was really where Nintendo and third parties became like oil and water to each other. The Switch seems to be working out a good deal better than their previous consoles have been for it though.
8588 2018-12-11 09:55:51 Speaking seriously for a moment (and only a moment), the term whole food #plantbased #vegan implies eating nonprocessed food, no oil, and extremely minimal amounts of sugar and salt.

8594 2018-12-11 09:55:12 Yes, we need more nuclear - but probably not coal, oil and gas fuelled power stations #innovate. I’m assuming you wouldn’t mind a nuclear power plant being built in Fulham?

8596 2018-12-11 09:55:02 Hello, thanks for your tweet! Without palm oil as an ingredient, the essential oils used cause the soaps to ‘sweat’. Therefore, to maintain the integrity and quality of the soaps, we’ve taken the decision to wrap them in Linear Low-Density polyethylene plastic (LDPE).1/4

8601 2018-12-11 09:54:39 Just a reminder that the amount of oil production both Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to cut down to is equivalent to their year-to-date average. They just made sure to show up in Vienna at the top of their game.

8659 2018-12-11 09:47:43 I’m simply asking why we should care and what we should do about it.  The two are connected, don’t you think?  We should care enough to not sell them our weapons, but not enough to stop buying their oil?  I’m just trying to understand what actions you think we should be taking.

8674 2018-12-11 09:44:48 lol, when one man controls the Oil and Gas resources of a country with 1.25 billion people, he makes money to do this every single minute.
8675 2018-12-11 09:44:45 All the oil means little without REFINERIES !  WHY AM I NOT PAYING 50 CENTS A GALLON ???? Oh and while I'm at it . . . Why kill forest that take centuries to grow for paper production when HEMP makes a superior product and can  harvest multiple times every 6 months? HEMP POWER !
8676 2018-12-11 09:44:42 I don't deny that. It's possible that this is unsustainable as many people believe. Peak oil, environmental degradation, etc. But if modern industrial civilization is destroyed, it will almost certainly be impossible to reconstitute it and secure our long-term survival.
8677 2018-12-11 09:44:41 Lol mqtan kd
8678 2018-12-11 09:44:15 It's high time the citizens gather enough courage to rise up and resist the intimidation they are subjected to by Zanu pf thugs. 38 years of being intimidated is too much. However,most of those rural fools vote for Zanu PF after being given rice,mealie meal,cooking oil etc
8679 2018-12-11 09:44:15 But @arunjaitley would not allow?BJP also could have give IOU bonds to Oil companies for selling cheap fuel.When consumer paid Rs 1000/- per Gas Cylinder then free gas Cylinder scheme became a liability..
8680 2018-12-11 09:43:43 asssha she's mad a mistake
8681 2018-12-11 09:43:33 That’s a pair of Blue Quail... and they live in oil palm estates!
8682 2018-12-11 09:43:30 It took us a long time to partner with the right supplier and sustainability in terms of palm oil plantations was a major consideration. Our supplier is a very well established European company who operate under the guidelines of international criteria for sustainable palm oil.
8683 2018-12-11 09:43:03 Saada and fooling like beans and red oil

8688 2018-12-11 09:42:37 Where re: oil pressure issue, I must have missed it?
8689 2018-12-11 09:42:35 Oil is still needed to make eco things and to run the world..it is here for a reason and not just to look pretty.
Natural selection happens, and we are animals and will kill things including plants.
8690 2018-12-11 09:42:19 Sana oil

8693 2018-12-11 09:41:55 the real question is how often they do hot oil treatments to prevent jinsouls hair from breaking off. we know that with the amount of bleach she probably doesn’t use hair ties regularly, most likely combs it instead of brushing, how much do they go out of their way to save it?

8701 2018-12-11 09:40:57 For Centuries Christians have been on a Crusade v Islam and most of today’s problems stem from British and US interference, eg whe n CIA decided to assassinate Iran’s democratically elected President in order to control its oil.

8703 2018-12-11 09:40:40 Why do we (USA) import oil??  Can’t we use our (USA) own oil and not buy Foreign Oil! Sounds kind of crazy to me.

8705 2018-12-11 09:40:17 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
8706 2018-12-11 09:40:17 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

8709 2018-12-11 09:39:50 Slice aalu sideways in circles. 5-6 lelo, depending on the number of people.
Heat oil in a wok. Add the aalu, zeera, Laal کٹی mirch, namak. Stir fry on high heat. Now add water, bring to a boil and lower the heat. Cover and let it simmer.
Usi mien aalu gal jayen ge. Make sure -

8712 2018-12-11 09:39:33 Truth is we never needed oil or coal  The end of the world is squarely on the oil business   Tesla

8715 2018-12-11 09:38:47 There's a great show on NRK about the nationalization of the oil industry in Norway rn. The improved innovation, efficiency and safety, and now they use the technology they developed to build infrastructure the US and UK wouldn't dare to, at a fraction of the cost as us.
8716 2018-12-11 09:38:30 Don't mean to be the bearer of bad news but Oil and Gas as a profession is DEAD IN NIGERIA. Young people please pick alternate careers. I am a living witness. Don't make the mistakes some of us made. I repeat Oil and Gas as a career path in Nigeria is DEAD!!

8722 2018-12-11 09:37:57 You're back to Venezuela - not in any way comparable to the UK. As a major oil producer in Central America, they have no choice by to trade in US$. Credit ratings have a much greater influence on their economy. Digressing again. Do you think the UK's economy is at capacity?

8734 2018-12-11 09:35:17 Tea tree oil works so well when it comes to breakouts. I’ve never seen anythinkg like it.
8735 2018-12-11 09:35:11 haha it is a just hashtag for all things related to the oil market. Not really your cup of tea! Stands for organization of oil trading tweeters.
8736 2018-12-11 09:35:07 Automation was a factor.
 Hardly fair to moralize when a large amount of money is spent in BC by Albertans.
 I'm not defending a horribly mismanaged Oil industry that cannot be sustained indefinitely but these are our fellow Canadians and we need to remember the basic goal
8737 2018-12-11 09:34:59 We saw them buying in a place that sells oil so we're just assuming lol
8738 2018-12-11 09:34:46 いいよね～～～～～
8739 2018-12-11 09:34:43 I wonder, does Quebec get any oil revenue from Alberta like the rest of the country? Perhaps if they are so resistant to the idea of oil moving through their province they should return the money they have made off of it. #AssHats
8740 2018-12-11 09:34:36 While I agree there are some facets might have been caused by bias, the problem is the JIT not the DSB. In any case the oil pressure issue has been solved beyond reasonable doubt to my mind. What could you possibly have still?
8741 2018-12-11 09:34:30 you need a little clay over kiln/pizza thing -- make ya own breads, then olive oil, some garlic, sun dried tomatoes. you'll be living! :) loving the daily videos.
8742 2018-12-11 09:34:22 Oregano oil..since i start take it never needed any antibiotics..few drops in a cup of water twice a day and that’s it.     Get well
8743 2018-12-11 09:34:19 Rather more likely to intervene offshore to save Sechin's oil and gas fields

8745 2018-12-11 09:33:57 Twitter to LinkedIn is called networking. Like I said, they were going to loose their jobs anyway even if it was @OfficialPDPNig in govt bcos the factors that caused recession couldn’t have been stopped. Fall of Oil prices and the fact we didn’t have savings to cushion the effect

8755 2018-12-11 09:31:13 Yes they do , two countries working in cooperation . Russia should buy Venezuela's oil using their own currency to by pass America sanctions. Squandering public funds that's rich 38 billion to Israel over ten years , tax cuts to the wealthy what is the American debt now ?

8766 2018-12-11 09:30:03 New Scientist Nov 11th. In next two decades emissions will continue to rise ,oil demand will increase.India's energy consumption will double, China's will slow but it will remain top CO2 producer.

8778 2018-12-11 09:28:16 but that doesn’t make sense because if you own the land and find oil then it’s yours and oil is under the ground. and like does that also mean that technically no one owns anything from here to the core?

8789 2018-12-11 09:25:54 I agree with that but we can't ignore the plight of Canadians
 Oil is a beast that eventually kills itself and everything around it
 A lot of these people were simply putting food on the table and can't be held responsible for the massive mismanagement and callous acts by Big Oil

8793 2018-12-11 09:25:31 Because our society is built on a foundation of fossil fuels. Commodity chains, tourism, our food, the jobs we create, all founded on oil and it's products. It's not innovation or investment we need. We need to decide what we can live without.

8799 2018-12-11 09:24:51 Indeed, this doesn't exactly inspire confidence. Workers in oil and gas shouldn't be hung out to dry, but this reads as just supporting business-as-usual: "long-term... stable investment" and doing "everything we possibly can" to help oil and gas.

Any thoughts @labourlewis ?
8800 2018-12-11 09:24:51 I am not surprised that countries whose economy depends almost entirely on oil esports such as Russia and Saudi Arabia reject climate change meassures that cd hurt them economically more then most other countries.

8808 2018-12-11 09:24:14 Words like eggless and atta don't mean squat if the recipe has been doused with sugar. Using oil doesn't mean your cake is healthier if it has a tonne of other stuff that increase the calories per serving. When did we start ignoring our brains? Wait don't answer that

But if the oil were to run out on Norway, the country would continue roughly to match its EU neighbors economically.

8881 2018-12-11 09:12:23 How about the government do something like subsidise electric cars and nationalise oil and petrol production in this country at a price that helps the poor. There’s enough local oil and gas. Just take it off the global market and do something for the people.
8882 2018-12-11 09:11:43 I quiet like tartan, Scotland should be proud of it. As for oil, well Norway’s 93 mtoe of 2016 vs UKs (Scotland’s) 46 mtoe  would suggest differently. And the figures are consistently less since 1998. Plus Norway’s reserves are greater than that of Scotland.

9045 2018-12-11 08:41:50 Those politicians are only doing what their constituents want them to do.

The oil companies need to convince the rest of Canada to build the pipeline so we can sell Canadian oil to other countries, it's a hard sell, but that's reality, that's democracy.

9050 2018-12-11 08:40:48 How a out 50c a litre at the pump to reflect the 50$ a barrel oil price? In 2008 1.50 a litre and 150$ a barrel. Today's ratio is 250% too high. You are ripping off consumers.

9068 2018-12-11 08:38:15 Also, Nationalisation isn't a free action. It has caveats. International and Canadian law require that any previous owners be adequately compensated for their loss.

It would be ludicrously expensive to nationalize oil today, and our return on investment will decrease over time

9108 2018-12-11 08:33:19 Third, a large percentage of the voting population was completely besotted with the idea of throwing a political bomb at Washington, and they were DETERMINED to vote for a supposed "outsider" like Trump, even though he was an obvious Snake Oil Salesman.

9125 2018-12-11 08:30:06 there are lots of ppl in the dailies, on the streets, and online, who erroneously believe we can and we should, replace oil with agric for our export economy.

9140 2018-12-11 08:27:42 Oil is surely the right thing in the age of global warming!
9141 2018-12-11 08:27:40 Yes, the numbers which get passed around oil companies are so wrong they might as well have been prepared by rolling dice.

 Consumer goods $300k/employee
 Finance $600k/employee
 Biotech $800k/employee
 BigTech ~$1M/employee
 Oil companies, $1.5M/employee
9160 2018-12-11 08:23:45 Basically palm oil is ‘sustainable’ and ‘clean’ if grown on land that was cleared at least 5 years before the present, whenever the present is. So all dirty unsustainable palm oil will magically become clean 5 years after the last tropical rainforest tree is felled.

9218 2018-12-11 08:15:36 I mixed it with apple cider vinegar, jojoba, castor and amla oil (don’t need all those oils but it dries quickly). Applied all through my hair, left it for 20 mins then washed it out.

9230 2018-12-11 08:12:37 I don’t think there is anything wrong with grass fed cows in Ireland. It’s a natural nutrient loop. I do think there is something wrong with rainforests being cut down for either cattle or palm oil production. All forms of factory farming of animals is the problem.

9234 2018-12-11 08:11:56 There are other factors to climate change then oil. Don’t let it be the black sheep. Even more than addressing how much carbon we put out, we need to address how much carbon we need to take in. And the answer to that is planting some damn trees and rebuilding eco-systems.

9241 2018-12-11 08:10:59 I do not believe hemp oil should be a solution. There are people really suffering and traditional medicines do not work all of the time. Is it ethically to deny something that could help when no other options are available?
9242 2018-12-11 08:10:58 So now we’ll have inner borders in the UK? How will you build a hard border between Scotland and England? How will you allocate resources in that split? All that treasure that has ended up in Westminster’s hands? Oil revenue?

9281 2018-12-11 08:03:14 We need to widely publicize the fact that Sanders’ employee Sirota wants 300,000 people in Texas who work in oil and gas and the related industries TO LOSE THEIR JOBS. That will end once and for all Sanders’ misbegotten attempt to pretend he’s for the little guy.

Oil will slump? So who's lying now? Trump or China?
9293 2018-12-11 08:01:40 True. Lots of WhatsApp , FB propaganda. Even common people fall into this trap of Congress. They accuse Modi of foreign trips, Oil prices, demo woes(they were supporting the cause but now..). Congress has succeeded in brainwashing.

9301 2018-12-11 08:00:25 No you don't understand the Alberta Oil industry was compromised by Conservative governments bought off by U.S. interests to ensure we never earned proper $$$ for our oil or got it to tidewater or had enough domestic refinery capability
9302 2018-12-11 08:00:16 The @CPC_HQ do not care about women, or workers, or anything except oil profits for their secret corporate donors in the oil lobby.

They will cut services, lower corporate taxes and completely fail Alberta just like PM Harper did - 0 pipelines built in 9 years, 0 diversification

9315 2018-12-11 07:58:36 A wondrous idea, but the ship is long sailed. After Alberta rejected nationalization of the oil supply, the entire supply chain in N. America became vertically integrated between competing gas companies. We can refine oil, but will lose money trying to find a buyer for product.

9328 2018-12-11 07:56:16 It's mainly in the extraction process. Virgin coconut oil is cold pressed to retain most of its beneficial properties. So it usually has a stronger smell/taste. The coconut oil for cooking is refined to make the taste and smell more neutral.

9347 2018-12-11 07:53:37 The PM's response to Pjam matter weak. Here are five reasons. (1). Forensic audit for oil loss only. Y not for $96m fence as well. Y was a forensic auditor not already engaged on emergency procurement basis and the name of firm announced. Only a promise to do forensic audit

9354 2018-12-11 07:53:03 That's the part I don't understand.  Why not CREATE JOBS!  Build a refinery or whatever they call those that don't refine exactly but make bitumen upgraded to the point where they aren't poisoning the pipe?  Then, when the oil can be moved via pipeline more safely, talk again.
9355 2018-12-11 07:52:52 I use tea tree oil for those.... It will dissolve itself after 4-5 night applications.

You need your pores. That's how oil and sweat reach your skin's surface.

9384 2018-12-11 07:47:20 Over 300,000 Texans work in the oil and gas industry. And many employees like my husband work in one and donated to Beto. The maximum individual donation for Beto - Or for Bernie - is $2700.
9385 2018-12-11 07:47:16 That’s one thing life teaches you...when you are doing good to someone don’t expect that person to do good to you because my dear you are going to be really disappointed..Allah yasa mu dace..
9386 2018-12-11 07:47:05 Not fair at all. Norway is one of the greenest and richest countries in the world, almost completely thanks to an oil and gas industry. It's about how we develop these resources and spend the money we get from them.

9493 2018-12-11 07:31:10 his rationalization is "turmoil and dysfunction" in Iran and Venezuela, neither of which are true.
he intentionally put the causality backwards; increasing Saudi oil production is impacting the market demand and subsequent supply of oil from the two countries.

9518 2018-12-11 07:27:05 Ade, the anointing is Christ. If you have him, you don't ever need that cooking oil. All of those practices were a pointer to JESUS CHRIST. He is the message of all the scriptures John 5:39. Luke 24:25-27. When you meet Him, those practices shd come to an end. Remain Blessed.

9520 2018-12-11 07:26:59 Poured hot groundnut oil on my feet yesterday just because of man's obsession with dodo..

Definitely done with that obsession for the rest of the year.
9521 2018-12-11 07:26:55 Serves him right. The old snake oil salesman thought he could come on Twitter, unchecked, with his daft claims - and get his halfwitted desperate followers to pay up for it.

9524 2018-12-11 07:26:34 Yes the world still needs oil. No doubt. But no one has figured out the real cost of a barrel selling for $20. Site remediation, pollution...time to think of exit strategy. Look at Heritage Fund  compared to Norway. Terrible management in Alberta.
9525 2018-12-11 07:26:18 The maximum any individual can give is $2700. We gave $500. And by the way the socialist candidate Sema Hernandez who opposed Beto? Her husband works for an oil company too.
9526 2018-12-11 07:26:13 You were probably in primary school when Yaradua was president. For what it’s worth, Yaradua was only able to save us from recession and do all that because we had our pool (FR) full, and oil prices at the highest. Buhari didn’t have that luxury, he still doesn’t. Education!
9527 2018-12-11 07:25:56 See go to store sef na same, yiu don't get. You buy a perf oil and in two months you struggle to perceive the smell. That's what I am angry at.

9530 2018-12-11 07:25:11 right now, the US (blessed with California, the world's main agricultural exporter) is blocking all food shipments to Venezuela and Cuba.

the only thing that Venezuela has to sell is oil, and small amounts of other natural resources (but those won't pay the bills)

9532 2018-12-11 07:25:00 Nice try. The money didn't come from corporations. It came from private citizens who happen to work for oil and gas companies. It's Texas, ffs. Over 300,000 people work in this field.

How stupid are you?
9533 2018-12-11 07:24:52 That was the difficulty Remain had after 8 years of needless austerity. The left behind wanting to wreck a system that doesn’t work for them is entirely understandable.

the US orchestrates economic warfare on developing countries that turn to socialism.
they did it to Cuba in the 1980s, dropping subsidised sugar onto the market and leaving it there.
9549 2018-12-11 07:22:36 Embarrassing to call it a State.

9556 2018-12-11 07:21:31 Key part is the growth is from the non oil sector. Clearly we are moving in the right direction in terms of diversification of the economy.

9558 2018-12-11 07:20:57 when your natural resources get devalued on the global market, it can cause monetary inflation.

meanwhile, about 30% of Ecuador's exports are oil, and their economy got hit with mild inflation at the same time as Venezuela's inflationary spiral.

2. Use a shampoo that suits your hair (try Marc Anthony Nourishing Argan Oil) and use it 3-4 times a week only. Use a conditioner too and massage your scalp with it.
3. Lessen the use of a blow dryer and hair iron.

9623 2018-12-11 07:11:49 omg it's high off the ground, those are trees! that's so much oil wth
9624 2018-12-11 07:11:44 Surprisingly today nobody is talking of EVM tampering? When Congress wins there is no fault in EVM. But results are not surprising. The way common man was stifled by oil prices, non sympathetic attitude towards working class, farmers, result couldn't have been anything different
9625 2018-12-11 07:11:38 They're not burning the oil in their country, but they're sending off to  go be burned somewhere else and reap the benefits in terms of revenue  and put that into the sovereign wealth fund which then gets funneled  into subsidies for electric cars. I think it's called genius.
9626 2018-12-11 07:11:37 it was a flamboyant night in rome when cole, the oil rig worker, met mike, a secretary, for the first time. they end up getting recruited by the local gang. they are played by donald trump and queen elizabeth.

9636 2018-12-11 07:10:23 ขอเล่าเรื่องสะเทือนใจที่เกิดเมื่อวานนี้

เก้าโมงเช้าเราได้รับข่าวจากแม่ว่าคนข้างบ้านเขายกครอบครัวไปเที่ยวที่เชียงคานขากลับเกิดอุบัติเหตุอาการสาหัสและเสียชีวิตสองคน ตกใจมากตอนนั้นพยายามหาข่าวจากจส.100 แต่หาไม่ได้เลย
9637 2018-12-11 07:10:17 Always has, even raises it annually at DSCC fund raisers. Beto took NO money from Oil and Gas but from employees. Bern takes PAC money. Beto doesn't. Beto is 'centrist' only as that's moved WAY left due to DEMS not BS. We know Sirota's an ass.

9647 2018-12-11 07:09:00 My husband donated to Beto and he works for an oil company. And drop the ‘executives’ nonsense. Over 300,000 people work in oil and gas in Texas and the vast majority are not executives.

9651 2018-12-11 07:08:07 yes that prison..... we know all about it
how he was allowed to take over a section of the floor... and inside that furnished "subjail"  ...  there was honey and olive oil.... and sunshine nurses... and whatever goes with all that... so stop mentioning all that... u overfed cow
9652 2018-12-11 07:08:04 Venezuela: largest oil reserve on the planet. Amazing.
9653 2018-12-11 07:07:46 In an ideal world, yes - I'm glad we agree on the point. But it just so happens that our current situation is proof that oil companies are not at all interested in sustainable development. A more hard hitting carbon tax would be the lesser of two evils.

9659 2018-12-11 07:06:58 It is normal for questions, speculation and doubts to arise. The DSB behaved politically and arbitrarily. Accident cases have been re-opened. I have never found a proper answer to the oil pressure issue. You would think oil pressure would be a priority value to be recorded.
9660 2018-12-11 07:06:53 I don’t think lavender oil works for pain, but I’ve heard really good things about oils in general. You should look into them they’re so many different forms of oils and blends.

You don't like Canadian oil, don't burn it, just don't lecture about the evils of Canadian oil while you are burning it or any other oil.

9711 2018-12-11 07:00:07 How does edible cooking oil clog pipes?  

How does it compare to the pipe-clogging potential of other food waste put through a kitchen sink garbage disposal?
9712 2018-12-11 07:00:00 I'm reminded of unemployment stats. 1975-10k. 1976-26k due to oil shock. If poverty & unemployment were a lifestyle choice / lack of personal responsibility, then why did  150% more Kiwis make that choice within 12 months? No right-wing reactionary hater has ever answered that.

9721 2018-12-11 06:58:32 Maybe it was good palm oil , there’s just a lot of adulterated palm oil in the market that makes cooking anything with it seem less appealing.

9737 2018-12-11 06:56:42 This seems to be a global disease. I’ve seen signs for “midtown” as part of “branding” efforts in London, which you’d think would hardly want to be seen aping NYC.

9755 2018-12-11 06:53:16 Really? Major companies make both rose water and lavender sprays, like Aura Cacia for instance. I find shelves stocked with essential oil and other rose/lavender sprays practically every time I walk into a natural products store. International drug store chains sell them now.
9756 2018-12-11 06:53:12 Food is costlier? Yes bcos of inflation precipitated by the oil price crash induced recession. Nothing complicated abt this. If u compare prices of commodities under Abacha they were cheaper than during ur sponsor's @OfficialPDPNig era. No cookies for guessing y on dis one

9763 2018-12-11 06:51:57 Pathetic is that you don't realize that the only reason Alberta is a have province is because you are sitting on oil, a resource whose value happened to skyrocket above others in the 20th century. Welcome to the 21st: Oil has bigger competition, & you put all eggs in one basket.
9764 2018-12-11 06:51:44 In response to my tweet about the exchange of political prisoners and POW's, you said: "the nazis only got cereal, grain, oil, and other foodstuff while the soviet union got the weaponry and equipment, so don’t misconstrue THAT." Crickets about prisoners/POW exchange. 
9765 2018-12-11 06:51:39 The pain I felt in me when an oil marketer while trying to tell Nigerians not to panic about possible fuel scarcity said we have imported refined petroleum that would last us for 55 days and there would be fuel beyond Christmas and New Year.

9790 2018-12-11 06:49:16 It seems oil can shut a lot of voices, even for climate change.  Saudi Arabian practices ensure the country comes in last among the G20 on almost every parameter of action taken to combat climate change. Shameful that media barely highlights it @Germanwatch

Saudi Arabia had 2 take drastic decisions and went as far as forcing princes 2 return some of their wealth 2 keep d country going. Its d consequences of not saving during d years of oil boom

9797 2018-12-11 06:48:30 Well, Saudi Arabia already live in the desert so they don’t care. Russia wants Siberia warmer so they can excavate for oil. USA wants to capitalise on Earth’s destruction. Expected.
9798 2018-12-11 06:48:22 It should have an effect only with a lag. @ru_minfin has been collecting extra revenue (above budgeted) for many months, as oil prices have been way above the assumed level.

9883 2018-12-11 06:37:50 That's true. Urals oil (as well as other sources) went down due increase of production by OPEC countries. Those increased their sales after US's request which was part of punishing Russia.

9893 2018-12-11 06:35:13 OIL?
9894 2018-12-11 06:35:03 You're creating a false dichotomy. Exxon doesn't burn the oil products themselves. We do it, along with a bevy of multinationals over which we have little control. Nobody here is denying that the ruling class is the BIGGEST problem but it's not the ONLY problem.
9895 2018-12-11 06:34:58 Ugh. Yeah, like an oil slick.

9899 2018-12-11 06:34:21 Agreed. Also ‘privilege of seniority’ inextricable from gender. Was v upset to see panel I was most looking fwd to with 3 of Karachi’s most badass women cancelled so disrespectfully. Experience & insight b/w 3 of u would easily put ‘seniors’ to shame /send them running 4 cover :)

9912 2018-12-11 06:32:31 Yes, this!!!  We need to get that message through.  I have to believe that most of the people in Quebec are intelligent people...aren't they.  Do they not understand who they are buying oil from...and is that okay?

9924 2018-12-11 06:31:01 While Trump and Kushner protect Saudi Arabia, Putin sends nuclear capable bombers to Venezuela.

Who do we buy more oil from?

Bernie Sanders is Jewish too and sells the Socialist snake oil while publically hating on his fellow Jews in Israel. #bdsfails 

I have disdain for self hating Jews!

9934 2018-12-11 06:30:08 Ever since the seventh grade (and I am 57), I wanted the US to be independent of foreign oil. Congrats to Trump and US. But it is our little conservative secret. The liberal media will never report. Let’s build big fans in the sky! That will work...NOT!
9935 2018-12-11 06:29:50 orphans are crybabies I would love some gruel, porridge, or slop. dress that shit up with some sichuan chili oil, crispy pork belly, bok choy, and a couple side dishes now we're talkin
9936 2018-12-11 06:29:46 it’s impossible to make italian food without olive oil think about it that’s kinda rude
9937 2018-12-11 06:29:44 Jojoba oil, egg white mask, Argan oil, etc. although keep in mind nothing will “heal” your hair if it’s already damaged, but it will keep it looking soft, shiny and more manageable than if left alone- but I’d avoid anymore dyes and slowly cut it out.
9938 2018-12-11 06:29:43 It would have been worst than nw if dey had continue due to how much barrel of oil cost then that dey use to embezzle to now
9939 2018-12-11 06:29:42 That’s not wholly true. Shale oil investments began a decade ago under Obama as the quantitative easing policy was put into place.  As noted two years ago when oil took a dip in to the $35 a barrel range as we started impacting supplies.   You can’t make up your own facts.   Sry

9942 2018-12-11 06:29:29 Well Rachel, if you hadn't screwed over every Albertan who voted for you, and people like me who definitely didn't, you wouldn't have fought to close our coal mines and oil industry! You deserve losing the election and everything you get after that!

9952 2018-12-11 06:27:58 Oof this happened to me for a long time when I switched meds so I had to trick my body into sleeping by listening to a podcast while sitting up in bed until I passed out from exhaustion and I know that's not a Plan but sometimes it worked! CBD oil also helped a bit.
9953 2018-12-11 06:27:53 The overlap between the parts of this country with oil and gas based economies and the parts of this country that don't trust traditional mainstream institutions is something that we need to do a better job of understanding

9959 2018-12-11 06:26:08 What about @GEJonathan he did 6yrs when crude oil was performing at its best, he never bothered to save neither diversify the economy away from oil dependency.. What pdp nd apc knw hw to do is loot nd as long as @bukolasaraki is in charge of atiku's campaign finances, smh

9961 2018-12-11 06:25:59 Dumpling on the Terrace, there used to be an amazing one in Newtown but I think it’s shut now, chilli oil dumplings at Cha on Courtenay are pretty good too
9962 2018-12-11 06:25:52 Another statement that is entirely illogical, since  electricity generation is not treated as a resource revenue in equalization, because that would mean oil/gas/coal would have to be calculated twice, once as a product, again as power...

9966 2018-12-11 06:25:08 Is coconut oil for hair different from coconut oil for cooking? @Precious_ao #askprecious
9967 2018-12-11 06:24:58 This is a good decision but we must move away from oil based revenue and build up other areas. Over reliance on oil is not good for us as a country
9968 2018-12-11 06:24:43 やっぱりかー…プニキすまん…
9969 2018-12-11 06:24:35 3) Any attempts to discuss a "solution" should be honest about the cost- and not just to the Greedy Big Oil Men but to ALL of us.

4) The activists need to TRUTHFULLY discuss the chance for success of the solution(s), as well as the risk/reward ratio of its implementation.

9975 2018-12-11 06:23:35 No one complained about eq payments until Quebec started with no pipeline, Alberta bad stuff.   The optics of a beneficiary of the oil industry impeding it and wanting it to fail is what gets people complaining.

9977 2018-12-11 06:23:33 Well then I would say wash it like one every 2-3 weeks. I use shampoo both times but i make sure to oil my scalp and condition every other day so it doesn’t dry out. Use a T-shirt instead of a towel to dry your hair too. The towel dries your hair out
9978 2018-12-11 06:23:24 I don't believe Capitalist Republican party leadership will listen or take action for renewable energy since they are owned by their lobbyists for Russia oil in Artic worth estimated 3 billion +
9979 2018-12-11 06:23:18 You need revenues to fund programs! A strong oil sector with % of revenues invested into sustainable technologies would be much more effective than a carbon tax that gives exemptions to every major polluter.

9992 2018-12-11 06:21:04 I disagree. The economy then was shaken due to falling oil prices, but was still the fastest growing economy in Africa and 3rd fastest growing economy in the world, and an investor’s destination, due to the very capable world class personnel managing it.

10005 2018-12-11 06:18:49 " is how you are acting." Funny when people sell snake oil and you refuse to buy it, they always ask that question. If evolution was anywhere near being legitimate, I wouldn't expect such gimmicks. You, Sir, are nothing but a Con Man.
10006 2018-12-11 06:18:37 Do you truly believe when the article says "Beto is second on a list of oil company donations" it WASN'T dishonest? Do you consider 50$ from a gas station attendant "oil company donations"? Why is it so hard to admit Sirota did what he did? Are you a troll or something?
