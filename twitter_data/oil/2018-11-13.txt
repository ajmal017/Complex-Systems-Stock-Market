what, then, of the oil barons who have killed all mankind?

56 2018-11-13 23:57:13 lol if you don’t outright condemn taking campaign donations from oil companies you’re not on anything even resembling my side.
57 2018-11-13 23:57:10 Crude oil dropped 8% today, so wait a day or two until those station misers to lower the price.

64 2018-11-13 23:56:28 So how do you think those numbers will be affected if there is a tanker spill? Or fish being killed?
You nailed it. It effects all of bc when these things happen.

I lived in Alberta. It isnt b.c. quit trying to make it about oil.
65 2018-11-13 23:56:23 The vast majority of people working in this field are METEOROLOGISTS.
Do you think they get paid more if it's hot? 

Exxon get paid to sell more oil.

Who do I trust?

Why is America still supporting Saudis if we have enough oil to support the nation? Oh, the GOP reversed laws allowing foreign exports.
71 2018-11-13 23:55:54 I won't buy any products with palm oil, even organic. Check your labels
72 2018-11-13 23:55:49 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.

75 2018-11-13 23:55:28 This. If people think the current conflicts over influence/control of oil rich regions is bad they have no idea what resource conflicts are. Countries need oil to wage war. EVERYONE needs water to NOT DIE.

90 2018-11-13 23:54:27 It's appalling that @GOP wants to defund @PPFA, forcing women to create babies. It's even more appalling the @PADems won't let me dump motor oil, forcing me to create whole river ecosystems.

126 2018-11-13 23:50:40 Hitting Oil is stealth QE but allows the Fed to save face (for now). Demand remains robust but this historic hit shows the power the State has to move prices. Not to mention sets the stage for much higher prices. Fed doesn't understand the cure for high prices is high prices.

134 2018-11-13 23:49:39 It would be an even bigger environmental disaster if all Palm oil was banned. Manufacturers should be forced to use sustainable sources. Remember the planting of any commercial crop leads to the destruction of natural habitats, the paper and pulp industry would just replace palm.

144 2018-11-13 23:48:47 I think a single fund may be the catalyst, and then like everything else stops get run and people pile on. Must be noted oil unwind started from an extremely elevated speculative position.
145 2018-11-13 23:48:45 PSA!!!

I HAVE BEEN USING CASTOR OIL DAILY ON MY EYEBROWS FOR THE PAST THREE DAYS AND ALREADY THE AMOUNT OF HAIR GROWTH IS UNREAAAAL EVERYONE DROP WHAT UR DOING N GET URSELF A BOTTLE & THANK ME LATER X
146 2018-11-13 23:48:44 I fought for my good friend @JoJoRiou. Jolene passed away this past spring but not a day goes by where her tenacity, her drive, her physical and mental toughness has taught me to live with no regrets and #F*ckCancer #HockeyFightsCancer
147 2018-11-13 23:48:24 I do not understand why people think cancelling this deal somehow punishes SA , if we cancel it , it costs Canada jobs , plus billions and then SA uses those billions and signs a new deal elsewhere ... cancel an oil deal if you want impact
148 2018-11-13 23:48:21 If it’s freezing out , i don’t suggest you going 0-60 off the rip, but if your concern is the viscosity of your oil, normal operation of your car will warm your oil up adequately without you letting your car idle
149 2018-11-13 23:48:20 there is a ceramic container on my stove for bacon grease. 
Old oil get poured into empty bottles-  empty 2 liter soda, empty oil bottle - anything big enough with a lid. I save a cpl just for that
150 2018-11-13 23:48:18 Oil down almost 5 bucks today on nymex......gas is already down to $2.37 in my neck of eastern nc.
151 2018-11-13 23:48:13 Mineral oil is not the primary cause of the post-AHA selling.
152 2018-11-13 23:48:13 One of the biggest offenders for using Palm Oil use is Nutella, gross
153 2018-11-13 23:48:10 Once you try the real deal I think the brand is Laubscher it is like $5.99/pound you will not go back to the fake stuff (there is a difference between milk & oil in the cheese)
154 2018-11-13 23:48:00 Then sya lang ba ang nagsuot nyan?, haha as far as I can see marami sila, and base on what I see sa kanya lang nabigdeal yan,
155 2018-11-13 23:47:55 curb stomp your local oil lobbyist
156 2018-11-13 23:47:55 So you 100% guarantee that no animal has lost their habitat due to your use of Palm Oil?
157 2018-11-13 23:47:51 No way oil could sit up there in the face of a well publicized slowdown in China. Orders just aren’t there and that speaks to more than oil.
158 2018-11-13 23:47:46 Coconut oil then wash your face then garnier micellar water
159 2018-11-13 23:47:21 You can stir oil and water all you want but they wont mix. So if you are water and in love with oil, good luck.
160 2018-11-13 23:47:10 The Oilers reuniting McDavid and Draisaitl tonight because they can't find any wingers for them. We had Hall, Eberle, Aberg (not good enough for the Oil, but good enough to play with Getzlaf), Perron, and on and on.. 
161 2018-11-13 23:47:06 Clearcast, a company owned by HSBC that just happens to have billions invested in palm oil, apparently.
162 2018-11-13 23:46:57 Gordon, With plunging oil prices, why aren't airlines rallying. Comments on $AAL please.
163 2018-11-13 23:46:50 Trump is demanding oil cartels INcrease supply’s to drive gas prices down.
All my trump supporting oil friends, what do you think about that?  It’s below $60 per barrel now
164 2018-11-13 23:46:42 I don’t know who needs to see this, but go get your oil changed
165 2018-11-13 23:46:41 The world is so starved of oil that it takes the actions of a cartel to prevent a collapse in price?
166 2018-11-13 23:46:34 2/2 $FANG also has over 2000 short Nov 105 puts in open interest putting a floor in the name for the week. With a small 95.4M float and elevated 12% short interest, this name can rocket higher on the back of surging NatGas prices (and hopefully recovery in Oil prices too).

170 2018-11-13 23:46:31 @eBay is a fucking JOKE. My boyfriend ordered parts for his sick grandmothers wheelchair, who just got out of a nursing home. They sent us USED parts and eyedrops and mango oil.
Want my future grandmother in law money back!
171 2018-11-13 23:46:28 Saka don't you ever act that you pay respect to our Flag, ni minsan ba tiningala mo sya?
172 2018-11-13 23:46:27 I'm personally very excited for "WWE Breaking Indigenous Treaties" and "WWE Oil is More Important Than Humanity Itself".
173 2018-11-13 23:46:26 Palm oil certification body @RSPOtweets will only be credible if its #palmoil growers like @Indofood eradicate exploitation, deforestation & destruction of ecologically precious peatland from plantations.  #RT16 #RSPO Stop buying anything with palm oil in it!
174 2018-11-13 23:46:21 I stand by my call for ppl to leak conf. govt info. When you work in oilfield, fluids like invert, kCl water or fracoil(in this case) soak your covies. Wearing frac oil soak covies can rub off on one’s face. The fact you think I wear makeup shows what a delusional punk you are.
175 2018-11-13 23:46:15 Allergy meds, take dairy and gluten out of your diet and hydrate inside & out! Lukewarm showers bc hot showers dry you out. &Lotion immediately after you shower. I recc coconut oil and Nivea lotion + hydrocortisone cream to treat the itching 
176 2018-11-13 23:46:14 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
177 2018-11-13 23:46:12 Owns the boozy cow in Dundee which refused entry to anyone with a saltire on the day of AUOB March and he LIED about oil reserves in 2014
178 2018-11-13 23:46:10 Soybean oil / palm oil are huge contributors to deforestation/species loss and are crapola #nsng
179 2018-11-13 23:46:09 The advert was banned because palm oil isn’t the problem! Organically grown palm oil is ok, regular palm oil replacements are a much heavier burden on the environment than palm oil. Iceland is just abusing the current mood for politically correct ingredients: disgusting!
180 2018-11-13 23:45:56 i had a whole breakdown today over the cost of winter tires and the fact that i HAVE to go to the dealer to change my oil
181 2018-11-13 23:45:40 As I said, speculators or oil barrons.

184 2018-11-13 23:45:08 i got sidetracked because my criminology reading mentioned armand hammer, an oil tycoon and thought it was armie hammer of call me by your name fame. but it turns out its his great grandfather who was the aforementioned oil tycoon
185 2018-11-13 23:45:07 What about oil going to 100?
You have a severe case of selective amnesia

188 2018-11-13 23:45:02 If they actually cared and it wasn't just marketing they would remove other brands products from their stores which contained palm oil, not just remove it from their own. Thats just a fact.
189 2018-11-13 23:45:00 So, iodine to help the body transmute radioactivity and Christ Oil to raise the vibration of the spirit body.

191 2018-11-13 23:44:56 I used simple sunflower oil or grape seed oil. Just don't make a mistake of using all olive oil. It becomes bitter. If you put like 1/5 of it, it gives a nice flavor. I ended up mixing garlic and fresh parsley in it. Man... That was great!
192 2018-11-13 23:44:55 Oklahoma is very windy. It’s known as tornado alley. We have more wind than oil and this is an oil state. The best thing for wind is height. The higher you are the more steady and stronger the winds.  The highlands near Asmera is a good place to start. Also near bodies of water.
193 2018-11-13 23:44:47 I got oil on my face again... How does it even get there...? -bot-
194 2018-11-13 23:44:40 I fight for my neighbor who was like a grandpa to me #HockeyFightsCancer

196 2018-11-13 23:44:28 Oil + blockchain = together you can kiss the earth's climate goodbye.
197 2018-11-13 23:44:26 The bottom line here Charles, and you know I voted for Trump, this was a Political Move disguised as attempting to minimize a predicted oil shortage related to sanction being imposed on Iran BY TRUMP! If he knew he was going to carve out concessions WHY FLOOD THE MARKETS?
198 2018-11-13 23:44:26 hot oil splashed on my foot and it hurt sooooo bad, i rather go through labor again than ever feel this pain.

203 2018-11-13 23:44:11 After killing someone for blood money you are still stingy the thunder that will fire you is just coming out of hot palm oil‍‍‍

207 2018-11-13 23:43:42 If they actually cared and it wasn't just marketing they would remove other brands products from their stores which contained palm oil, not just remove it from their own.
208 2018-11-13 23:43:41 I agree its plausible but not sure it's the probable explanation. Don't know that a single fund dumping oil can do this much damage
209 2018-11-13 23:43:32 damn @community_recs is selling a van that runs on veggie oil rn but its new orleans so the OTHER LA

211 2018-11-13 23:43:29 Because @hemp_worx is full of shit and has been warned multiple times by Health Canada that they are NOT allowed to market in Canada. 
Snake oil sellers TO THE EXTREME their reps literally harass you, and holy hell when you call them on their BS they go insane.
212 2018-11-13 23:43:21 Fear mongering works! These arm chair analysts can spew verbal garbage and many will believe them. None has pointed to any evidence linking mineral oil to cardiovascular disease. Why not? It does not exist.
213 2018-11-13 23:43:13 lol get the oil stick the chips in and eat  thats what I do. actually sometimes I get chips ready mate and stick them in the oven and they taste good but they are too thick
214 2018-11-13 23:43:04 Correct me if I'm wrong. Offshore personal travel to platform via chopper in east coast of Peninsular usually take off from KB Airport kan? Like Miri is hub for East Malaysia oil/gas field.
215 2018-11-13 23:42:56 Also the oven isn't pre-heated? And there's no sugar or honey or oil of any kind? I don't think I trust this.

-do you have any dog treats that help with anxiety?
- - this one has CBD oil

218 2018-11-13 23:42:54 so oil prices will climb if your claim of increased demand and lower supply is true
219 2018-11-13 23:42:52 Tbs tea tree oil mantul
220 2018-11-13 23:42:46 Significant point- we are not Norway.
And oil revenue has been spent as part of the UK budget over all that time. It went to public spending.
This is all obvious, basic stuff. It’s the same made-up, inaccurate, immature, uninformed Twitter nationalist gripes.
221 2018-11-13 23:42:38 #HockeyFightsCancer

Great cause! Buy a toque on Sunday!

222 2018-11-13 23:42:28 I don't know much about it, yet, but it's something to look into. Overall, my stance has been against drugs, of all kinds; but I'm trying to keep an open mind and I'm learning more about CBD oil, especially. I know many who swear by it for pain, tremors, and anxiety.
223 2018-11-13 23:42:25 Are you mad, continental Europe with out USA would not last a week against Russia,for a start they’d cut off oil and gas . Before unleashing the red army,and a lot of Europeans aren’t known for their fighting ways.
224 2018-11-13 23:42:06 That's not true

Some Canadian companies are calling for cut backs in Alberta production so we stop giving away oil, owned by Albertans, at $20/bbl because of pipeline opponents who have successfully worked against Canadian strategic interests.
225 2018-11-13 23:41:59 Demand not current issue for #oil IMHO, market participants anticipated 4M Iranian barrels coming off market per Trump who asked Saudis to pump, Russia lock-stepped with Saudis. So, huge near-term differential from expectations when Trump gave waivers to only Iran’s big customers
226 2018-11-13 23:41:58 Should have been an all Republican special counsel appointed a long time ago to investigate Hillary,  FBI/DOJ . According to libs would have been nothing wrong with it.

228 2018-11-13 23:41:51 Who do oil changes for the low ?
229 2018-11-13 23:41:49 The Venezuelan army poses little to no threat. It is surrounded by US allies and is extraordinarily impoverished.  One bombing to their oil fields or even an embargo style deal in partnership with Saudi would ruin them.
230 2018-11-13 23:41:45 新しく追加されたOil

231 2018-11-13 23:41:41 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one

244 2018-11-13 23:41:01 Warner is right because, after the obvious murder, he still forged on with the oil deal because it's all about the money and the press he hates.#CollusionAlternativeFactsAccomplace
245 2018-11-13 23:40:43 Anyone who needs heavy oils, hydrocarbon based fuels, fertilizers, a bewildering range of plastics, drugs, etc.
There will always be a demand for oil - it provides the basic building blocks for so many materials & products.
Production volume will depend on what it gets used for.
246 2018-11-13 23:40:42 I would say it would be. More countries are coming out of third world status and they need oil to do that.
247 2018-11-13 23:40:33 …ｽﾔｽﾔ
248 2018-11-13 23:40:33 Urgent vote to transform the #palmoil industry! RT to tell palm oil body @RSPOtweets to become credible & adopt ‘No #Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ policies in its new rules - and enforce them against @Indofood too!  #RT16 #RSPO
249 2018-11-13 23:40:30 Tease Hakan by filling the room with oil, and those who get out before drowning get a free Season 4 code
250 2018-11-13 23:40:27 That’s what’s so very special about it.  I have a new found respect and admiration for him while realizing how judgmental I have perhaps been.
251 2018-11-13 23:40:25 you do know the intrinsic value of crude is now about $22 - I mean deep deep down you do know it right?  Ever ask what Saudi Arabia does with their oil, the price they offer, when the realize US doesnt need a drop and that US can supply others to replace Saudi Arabia exports?
252 2018-11-13 23:40:15 It’s an amphora. Used to hold either wine or oil.  Lid kept things out of your expensive food stuffs.
253 2018-11-13 23:40:12 That’s what I would call fair play, you’d thing our English cousins would be glad to get shot of us, after all our oil is running out & we’re poor as church mice  England free yourselves from the poor wee whinging Scots

255 2018-11-13 23:40:11 Will you please take a class on basic economics!?! Over production = lower price = lower production = job losses. Oil production, price per barrel and supply & demand are a delicate balancing act. Stay out of it, you are not an expert by any stretch of the imagination.
256 2018-11-13 23:40:01 2012! A year named after my net worth! (Assuming couch change and oil being made from my blubber).

258 2018-11-13 23:39:47 I don’t know that it makes a huge difference? But I def notice a difference in flavor and moisture with just a bit of olive oil.
259 2018-11-13 23:39:47 It's been a life saver, honestly. There was to a point that I was on antibiotic eye drops every day for 4 months. Then I got fed up and bought coconut oil. I havent been on them once in almost a year!

I love that stuff haha now I understand why people go crazy for it

261 2018-11-13 23:39:41 @selecttrades How do like $USO as a hedge against the pain at the pump? I started a position at the beginning of the month and added to it today. Oil isn't going to be this low forever. #BlackGold #TexasTea
262 2018-11-13 23:39:37 Oil prices are dropping?

271 2018-11-13 23:38:48 You don't know shit about me. We never should have supported Saudis in anything. It's a corrupt monarchy that damn near destroyed this country in 70s with oil embargo. We should not support their bombing of Yemen. They should be hauled in front of World court as war criminals
272 2018-11-13 23:38:48 I'm aware of Norway's natural resources,  what % of weekly cost to the #EU would increase the Norwegian oil reserve subsiding throughout the G28 per barrel in tax form to their citizens? Total control has and always will be the definition of imperialism.
273 2018-11-13 23:38:45 To the people telling her to pump the brakes and wait, the damage we're doing to the environment isn't going to wait and it sure as hell won't wait for Pelosi, none of us should, there's no fucking way Pelosi is going to go against Big Oil and actually initiate a real effort.
274 2018-11-13 23:38:43 @sardofoods Hi, I was hoping to find info on Seafood Sensations Spicy Jalapeno Shrimp in Olive Oil. I assume the shrimp are cooked & just need warming up?

281 2018-11-13 23:38:05 I would definitely recommend it, it made such a difference for me. Was getting me so down as they were just so painful and itchy! I didn’t think to try coconut oil, that’s a good idea, will definitely have to pick some of it up 
282 2018-11-13 23:37:46 Wow, that's nonsense. Any potential owner who wants to create brand awareness will be put off. That leaves speculators or oil barrons.

285 2018-11-13 23:37:33 But as usual you didn't address the facts, North Sea oil is real it does exist, but whereas Norway has a $Trillion sovereign wealth fund, the UK has nothing, do you get that? Nothing & guess what, there was no SNP management of any of that, it was all WM, where did it go?

382 2018-11-13 23:29:36 Who said this is bad news?
Yes, it's bad for the oil industry and lower oil profits tax revenue for the Treasury.
But it's good news for those who buy oil, including car owners, transport firms and the logistics sector - lower prices, higher profits, possibly more growth.

388 2018-11-13 23:29:07 Yeah. Shipping things from the US can be an option, depending on the item it is often cheaper. In the current situation I need a certain type of AC compressor oil that I can only buy in 1 liter bottles for $50 and I need less than 250ml.

410 2018-11-13 23:27:12 Can trade oil between 55 to 59.2
411 2018-11-13 23:27:05 Well, in my view violations against the Constitution are offenses against America. The issue that got Acosta's pass taken away was asking where talk of caravan was after the election as Trump milked it before hand then dropped it.
I agree with you about Yemen.I
It seems oil  and
412 2018-11-13 23:26:49 Oil and Gas companies comprise 40% of the S&P 500 and 6.5% of the DOW ....YOU DO THE MATH!
413 2018-11-13 23:26:46 idk whose daughter needs to hear this but, GET AN OIL CHANGE !
414 2018-11-13 23:26:38 It’s our new carbon tax. Oil is dead.

422 2018-11-13 23:25:55 Let it warm up until it reads on the temp gage, it starts showing @ 98°. Read up on cold oil, engineering reports not somebodys opinion.

432 2018-11-13 23:24:20 I used to be for the pipeline, when I thought it was going to provide oil for Americans and lower our cost and give us energy independence.

Then I found out it's being used to ship Canadian oil to Saudi Arabia Refinery and then shipped out globally.  

Hell No

439 2018-11-13 23:23:37 $2.48 a gallon while the oil companies post anywhere from 7 to 10 billion in profit quarterly! The price of fuel shouldn't be over $1.25 reduction in taxes on fuel would dramatically dropped the price of fuel
440 2018-11-13 23:23:31 É leviano dizer que uma queda no preço do oil, se perdurar por um tempo maior nesses niveis de hoje, pode diminuir pressão inflacionária nos países importadores de petrólio? Alguns emergentes, etc e próprio US?
441 2018-11-13 23:23:28 Guthrie was head of the ABC, hardly a shrinking violet and certainly no oil painting.Are we to beleive she wasn't capable of addressing this issue, then her sacking is more than justified in full.
442 2018-11-13 23:23:27 Both of my children seem entirely unmoved at the plunge in crude oil today.  What is wrong with them?  Why weren’t they watching CNBC?
443 2018-11-13 23:23:23 I was Team Trump since Aug15 but based on the screw job he pulled on oil workers he’s just about lost my vote.  Worst time possible as 2019 capex could be ratcheted way lower.  Making a super spike much more probable.
444 2018-11-13 23:23:19 The Gulf states seem to be experts in the construction of beautiful, new megacities from the ground up. Let’s see some of that oil money used to build New Palestine. NEOM should be relocated to the southern part of the Negev, make New Palestine a special international zone
445 2018-11-13 23:23:15 Believe it or not, I can still taste the liquid cod liver oil in my throat every now and then even though I only had it once decades ago.
446 2018-11-13 23:23:14 That's a fair point and taking out the biodiesel component would reduce oil demand. Nevertheless even without biodiesel global demand for vegetable oil is still projected to increase. Have a look at The Tropical Oil Crop Revolution: Food, Feed, Fuel and Forests. Oxford Uni Press
447 2018-11-13 23:23:05 Show proof of wrong doing like the judge said or keep quiet. Your the emperor with no clothes! Although the machines should be independently inspected for accuracy but your not advocating that and tell you why your a sell snake oil salesman.

457 2018-11-13 23:22:23 Hahahha. I have stories to last years. he was here some time ago. i should have told you sef! Maybe na you do that palm oil grinding machine he raves about!
458 2018-11-13 23:22:16 That and the fact that the US is now a net exporter  of oil plus the deal with Poland to supply them with natural gas.  The economic prosperity from that will be gigantic.

468 2018-11-13 23:21:17 It's rural vs urban bifurcation of our society. Texas is just one of the few high population states that ALSO has a huge rural population, so the urban voters can't dominate the entire rest of the state (like Cali or NY). That will probably remain for a long time due to oil+farms

474 2018-11-13 23:20:32 I'm really not getting hysterical old friend, I'm just shocked to see how this legitimate but easily explained and nominal mineral oil issue turned out to be an earthquake size problem
475 2018-11-13 23:20:31 Why is it o.k. for Trudeau to take our money and buy Enbridge pipelines but B.C. is attacked on C.B.C. for having carbon tax? Does C.B.C. speak for big oil and against democracy?
I am not interested in listening to right wing propaganda and oil lobby.

476 2018-11-13 23:20:29 Do u mean like should I start building an underground bunker on a mountain top to survive capitalist climate Armageddon? I’m more worried about my kids’ future than my retirement.  When will banks help me with that instead of fracking and oil?
477 2018-11-13 23:20:18 Pretty sure my house isn’t made of palm oil so I don’t know why they thought it was worth starting for lol

487 2018-11-13 23:19:24 Lots of money offshore  - Tax Havens, Russian slush, City of London business, HSBC drug cartel money - money from arms sales to Saudi &c – oil money in general - dealt with under the table with the  EU for #brexitdeal. Backstops and everything else just smoke and stuff.
488 2018-11-13 23:19:23 Oil palm causes <1% of global deforestation. I am not defending it - plenty to improve in the sector. But have a look at other oil crops - soy, coconut for deforestation; rapeseed, sunflower, peanut for dying agricultural landscapes. Data are there and you should have a look
489 2018-11-13 23:19:21 @RSPOtweets please vote yes on key #palmoil safeguards. 70% of Sumatran rainforests gone because of palm oil. These standards, if enforced, will help protect against deforestation & exploitation. #RSPO #RT16

502 2018-11-13 23:18:15 Let me tell you something: there is money in creationism.

Big money.

It doesn't come from industry. Only one oil company considered creationism for where to find oil, and they folded quickly. The medical industry has found no preditive power in ID. Advanced engineering doesn't
503 2018-11-13 23:18:11 Sweet
504 2018-11-13 23:18:11 Doesn't have to be a concern. And that US indulges in the root cause for self. The problem for all . Only a few weeks ago you said US is self suffient in oil now and laughing at everyone.

508 2018-11-13 23:18:04 ...so after the next carrington event were f'd cuz we sold all our oil and it takes billions of years to make more...is that your plan?

518 2018-11-13 23:16:35 It can be sustainably produced, although only at a small scale, as it was already for centuries before the PO boom. The thing is we need to regulate supply chains. Even the corporations that claim to use only sustainable palm oil are not being honest because they can't really

526 2018-11-13 23:16:11 they will be destroyed. And we won't have the funding down the road to protect/fix it because oil/gas usage is increasing in the world but the money is not coming to Canada.

529 2018-11-13 23:15:41 Agree, DJT IS ONLY concerned about how to keep oil price lower to get re-elected, drumming about USA is the biggest oil producer, he has no idea oil price at $55, USA exports her crude less than the cost of production.

1. preheat your oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit. grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.

2. in a large bowl, mix together the dry ingredients.

3. once mixed, pour in the agave/maple syrup, egg, oil, applesauce and vanilla. mix well. pat the mixture evenly into the greased pan.

534 2018-11-13 23:15:11 Ok, thanks for that. So regardless if WWF etc., is it the case that RSPO needs replacing with a better organisation/regulatory body, or is it that palm oil can never be sustainable produced as far as you are aware?

541 2018-11-13 23:14:38 Anybody got any good places to buy essential oils from (online or instore in you live in Saginaw)? I got a oil diffuser and I want to purchase some more oils for it

543 2018-11-13 23:14:23 @AJonesMP I have signed the governmental petition tonNAN THE SALE OF UNSUSTAINABLE PALM OIL...#environment #notopalmoil
544 2018-11-13 23:14:22 they teamed up with green peace recently, “By the end of 2018, 100% of our own brand food will contain no palm oil. We are the first UK supermarket to commit to removing palm oil from all own brand food” but i agree it’s all a bit dumb considering the video came out months ago 
545 2018-11-13 23:14:13 Because THEY allowed a mineral oil placebo to be used? Great....
546 2018-11-13 23:14:13 I had a new 130 ft well drilled today on my property in Illinois. Was hoping to hit oil instead we hit water.

Now that’s swaggy

Now it's getting others to take that burden off you.
552 2018-11-13 23:13:50 Its been a busy 2 days for @SheldonFire white - we have dealt with multiple secondary fires, FAE and a fire involving molten metal and hydraulic oil. Fast, effective fire fighting preventing further spread of fire in difficult working conditions.

554 2018-11-13 23:13:28 Today's Market = Baked Potato

Pretty bland market action today outside of the news in oil. Crude prices have dropped more than 20% since September, mostly driven by unexpected oversupply. Apple also showing signs of weakness from their suppliers.

555 2018-11-13 23:13:08 I have oils from edens gardens that can be consumed but you have to dilute them using coconut oil AND put the mixture in a dissolvable capsule
556 2018-11-13 23:13:06 Gasoline price used to be the deciding factor in presidential elections - if that's the case President Trump should be a shoo-in.  His relentless pressure on OPEC including yesterday's tweet has resulted in biggest oil swoon in history.  Just in time for holiday shopping.
557 2018-11-13 23:12:58 I had some amazing oil positions earlier this yr. Missed a lot more upside but got out in time.

567 2018-11-13 23:12:24 I pray that I'm wrong but this just tells me that the govt is slowly getting involved in CBD oil and marijuana distribution in cahoots with big pharma ugh!!!  If so, it won't be the same. Are u able to get a prescription for CBD oil? I wish you well.
568 2018-11-13 23:12:11 Congrats on the Top Ten?! Glad to see you back in an MX-5!
569 2018-11-13 23:12:07 As for impacts, I don't have the data to give you a detailed answer but I know that no other vegetable oil has been linked to massive deforestation before the PO boom, so it's not like industrial PO replaced worse performing oils.
570 2018-11-13 23:12:05 Man i spent $100 on oil just to do my oil change 
571 2018-11-13 23:12:04 Yes, but oil money is being used to keep wind and solar from developing into cheap energy sources. They are a big source of corruption in the USA and the rest of the world.
572 2018-11-13 23:12:02 The Oil fans that sold their tickets for double the face value 
573 2018-11-13 23:12:01 No it’s not. Healthcare is an issue. Oil will keep the US from doing anything about Saudi Arabia.

581 2018-11-13 23:11:30 Worried simultaneously about the price of groceries and the use of palm oil in said groceries? Nah? Then adulthood is far, far away and you just need more iron in your diet or more joy to chase.
582 2018-11-13 23:11:28 Let me guess; you think coconut oil and MCT are bad sources of fat?
583 2018-11-13 23:11:15 Fk big oil they have so much money power but tjey knew in the 80s that it would fk up the mother earth
584 2018-11-13 23:11:14 Yep. Need an oil change but who knows how much longer that would have taken. At least my car passed!
585 2018-11-13 23:11:05 If it's used by Russia against terrorists tht are crucifying/burning/head chopping people; yes. You have no point here; it's a known fact tht FUKUS have been supporting terrorists & US started Syrian war to overthrow Assad. It's about petro-dollar/arms/oil. It's not humanitarian.
586 2018-11-13 23:11:05 Here's the plan, Yossarian:

1) offer stink bid of negative $5/bbl on Canadian WCS oil futures. 

2) secure 5 billion barrel contract

3) buy $10Bn of carbon credits to keep Trudeau happy

4) invest the other $15bn to build that stupid freakin Transmountain pipeline.

Retire.

Greenpeace now whipping up a SCARE CAMPAIGN over something that hasn't happened?  #THEIRABC are a JOKE!   Why are we paying for this PROPAGANDA?
591 2018-11-13 23:10:14 That question resides on the mistaken assumption that we would consume the same amount of oil if we dropped industrial palm. But this ignores how cheap PO led to a massive increase in oil consumption, including in biodiesel.

595 2018-11-13 23:10:06 Consuming 100 million barrels of oil a day or 20 billion 790 million liters per day and that’s somehow affecting our environment . Really???????????????????
596 2018-11-13 23:10:01 About a month ago liberals on social media were saying $75 oil was trumps fault. A quick $20 collapse later....
597 2018-11-13 23:10:01 So Norway have managed to sink their newest frigate that cost the same as their yearly navel budget, because the captain wouldn’t go around an oil tanker. And then they went with a cheap salvage company that didn’t know what they were do, and then it sank.
598 2018-11-13 23:09:57 And a great relief for the consumer (lest we forget). The poor consumer that has been squeezed, with poor wage growth, interest rate hikes and high oil prices, now has a chance at improving their disposable income.
599 2018-11-13 23:09:56 I agree, dems will revoke tax cuts, go back to getting screwed in trade, stop coal/oil, let factories move out and then sell their shit back to usa along with high unemployment and paying for nato again. But, they will be politically correct and do nothing! Can't wait for that!!

602 2018-11-13 23:09:36 Iran's GDP is growing this year & next year & it's the 17th largest economy in the world. In any case, soon the world won't need oil anymore, human resources are more important than natural resources. Unfortunately for you, you lack in that department.

I still can't believe anyone who served there voted for trump after he said epic stupid "we should take the oil".

613 2018-11-13 23:07:52 @htsfhickey  Correct, too many trend followers. Today, I bought the first small call on Brent oil at 65.90 $. The next 2 weeks will be very interesting. Even gold and silver will have a comeback, because nobody expects a u-turn of the Eur/$. So I am slightly long gold and silver.
614 2018-11-13 23:07:50 We hear you. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years.  We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.

622 2018-11-13 23:06:57 Apparently crude Oil prices have dropped 28% since Oct  I paid 1.34 for Diesel in September and now it is at 1.39 .Always annoying that when crude moves up the petrol pumps move the same day but when it goes down .....#oilprice #Topaz #shell #Texaco
623 2018-11-13 23:06:57 Yeah see the fact you're connecting this to Growth Mindset snake oil shows exactly my problem with it.  You're two steps awake from berating "snowflakes" and "participation trophies" if you swallow this stuff.

When some even then pointed out Iraq had zip to do with that, they invented the whole “Iraqi nukes!” scam, but that was secondary.

658 2018-11-13 23:03:24 yes! your main concern will be protein. at the time of the appointment, it's a good idea to slather your hair in coconut oil (it's the only oil proven to reduce protein loss in the hair), so you can minimize initial damage during the bleaching process.

663 2018-11-13 23:03:12 Could we see prices in the 10's now that oil has gotten down significantly? Like 102-105.9?
664 2018-11-13 23:03:11 I don’t get it - global growth has been trending lower since at least last summer. Where is the demand for more oil at $70 going to come from?
665 2018-11-13 23:03:03 US oil companies were driven out of Vzla, even though the contributed significantly to the economy. Vzlans who were employed by the O&G were forced to leave Vzla for work. The brightest and the best have left over the past 20 years. Maduro came in and made it even worse.

674 2018-11-13 23:02:26 The people of Ontario will save nothing the oil companies of Ontario will increase profit margins. What about the rebate the the feds were going to give?

Seriously bad luck guys..
677 2018-11-13 23:02:10 What's the other major concern about the data? size of effect, potential adcom, commercial, Doesn't it all stem from the effect of the mineral oil? No position. Honestly curious.

680 2018-11-13 23:01:58 OIL RECAP: WTI posted the biggest one-day drop since 2015 amid a record losing streak. Supply fears + worries over sluggish demand weighing on the crude market #OOTT #oilmarket #WTI #Brent
681 2018-11-13 23:01:37 Thank you. I have a choice now 
No reason why palm oil needs to be added.
682 2018-11-13 23:01:24 Off the top of my head: valuation, cash-position, appropriability of the drug product, uptake by a medical community that is historically skeptical of fish oil, lack of clarity on the mechanism of a benefit of the drug, lack of clarity on regulatory perception of REDUCE-IT trial
683 2018-11-13 23:01:10 What's your favorite essential oil?
684 2018-11-13 23:01:00 I'm just now about to get an oil change. I'm 10k miles over... Don't judge me. 
685 2018-11-13 23:00:55 With Natgas vol at three year low and crude oil vol at one year high it appears it’s time to take the other sides?
686 2018-11-13 23:00:49 eh, everything that’s got a heavy contingent of spec/renters got crushed today.  

i haven’t seen a single piece of published research that puts much stock in the mineral oil placebo issue.

probably was overbought going in.

704 2018-11-13 22:59:44 Mr Birol included the usual caveats about allowing carbon capture and storage, and used weasel terms like 'low carbon economy'. There are no plans to stop mining and burning coal, oil, and gas. All high level claims about ending coal are about #unabatedcoal #traditonalcoal

709 2018-11-13 22:59:00 Be sure to change your compressor oil periodically. If your compressor uses oil, you should top it off before you use it. After every 500 – 1000 hours of use, you will want to change your compressor.

728 2018-11-13 22:56:59 " Sustainable palm oil " means nothing. It's called stop cutting down the trees. The government has been destroying the natural world for a couple centuries now. Hopefully this decade humans become aware of what is going on.
729 2018-11-13 22:56:58 The game is called: sanction on and sanction off to push every producer to max their output. In the long run, as oil producer equity prices all collapse now, oil industry will be starved off capitals, we will have sky rocketing oil price.

746 2018-11-13 22:54:58 Oil prices are back below $60 a barrel.  The largest importer of oil is China.  Does this indicate recession in China coming? #oil #oilprices

751 2018-11-13 22:54:30 Maybe we could donate twice the amount to 1) piss off every other club and 2) launder some of the money we’ve made from oil and genocide ...
752 2018-11-13 22:54:16 Marmite, ingredients include palm oil 
753 2018-11-13 22:54:06 Give me one form of land use that is socially and ecologically sustainable, apart from natural environments from which all people and their technologies have been removed. Sustainable potatoes? Wheat? Rice? Cotton? I don't think so. Why then pick on palm oil?
754 2018-11-13 22:53:53 You mean like when you let investors know that in the midst of the FED tightening, Tech Correcting and economies slowing you were going to TANK OIL FOR VOTES to ad to the markets MISERY??? NO WE DIDN'T GET THE MEMO! @LPNational @CNN @WSJ @themotleyfool @CNBC @FoxBusiness

756 2018-11-13 22:53:42 @CadburyUK So, what are you doing about removing palm oil from your products? How about going back to the old recipes?

762 2018-11-13 22:52:53 The sugar is sweating out of it! I’ve had it happen to my pavs too after awhile but it’s never looked this gross and cod liver oil tablety
763 2018-11-13 22:52:48 I think we need to drastically reduce oil palm consumption, as it's not sustainable at a large scale. I also think that corporate certification schemes are usually greenwash and that to have better oil palm we need to regulate supply chains and go against industrial interests.
764 2018-11-13 22:52:43 Elections made up the direction of our nations. We vote for our PM, Cabinet and MEPs to work together in directing how we work together in various common intetests.

767 2018-11-13 22:52:19 Do you think anything is being done regarding infrastructure, oil refining capacity and the power grid? Or do you feel it is not enough. 

This is for your own assessment. I won’t argue if you think otherwise.

778 2018-11-13 22:51:40 Inventories are high and the economies in Europe and China are softening.  Oil is a commodity so it's based on supply- demand situation.
779 2018-11-13 22:51:36 Aaah. Now it makes sense... I thought it was lobbying by palm oil users like Kellogg or Unilever etc...

789 2018-11-13 22:51:02 I am familiar with the history/court case. Bill C-48 prevents supertankers of crude oil from moving through there in large quantities, but does not prevent refined oil products from the route. This leaves the door open for future oil refinery projects on B.C.’s north coast.

805 2018-11-13 22:50:05 Depends on your view point.. If the alternative to better oil palm is no oil palm, then you might be right. If the alternative is more of the worse stuff, then it is not greenwash but an urgently needed attempt to improve practices in the sector.
806 2018-11-13 22:49:59 @CadburyUK @CadburyWorld as a billion pound world wide company can you tell me why you insist on using palm oil in your products please? Are you that focused on profit you are happy to wipe out an entire species of orangutang?

808 2018-11-13 22:49:56 Oil down 8% overnight and it has fallen more than 20%. With improving GST collections, IIP data , cooling inflation the rally is just a question of when . 

this is purely my view and things might out turn differently, so you could do your own due diligence before investing
809 2018-11-13 22:49:52 Rule of thumb BTU equivalency is 6X natural gas MMCF for each barrel of crude oil. Oil and gas can go in opposite directions for quite a while before crude substitution would lift crude and depress gas.

815 2018-11-13 22:49:30 Are those.....fish oil pills on the top? 
816 2018-11-13 22:49:18 No. Because rightly see the EU in the same way as the old Soviet Union. Instead of central control and instruction coming from Moscow, it eminates from Brussels. Elections are just a facade of propriety
817 2018-11-13 22:49:18 Cadburys. Now with added palm oil and just a suggestion of Orangutan tears.
818 2018-11-13 22:49:11 There’s obviously a connection. Gas prices in Germany just don’t move alongside oil, really...
819 2018-11-13 22:49:08 Oil change every 5-7k miles (depends on model). Tires every ~10k

822 2018-11-13 22:49:02 Every trader's view on oil comes down to a set of lines on a chart.
823 2018-11-13 22:49:01 $OIL crash ez to predict. Might influence stock crash?
824 2018-11-13 22:48:55 Seriously Nikki, it’s a story that merits either a giant heroic oil painting, or a slow-motion “bullet-time” film clip.
825 2018-11-13 22:48:54 Oil down to 55.50 it lo s t 7℅ overnight
Dow down 100 so wait and see
826 2018-11-13 22:48:35 Hey #MAGA Chumps, how's that #GOPTaxScam working out 4 You - Companies continue to layoff - stock buy back in droves w/their tax cuts - oh markets & oil dropping faster than UR leader's fat-ass in a fast-food seat. Ready 4 that next #RepublicanRecession? it'll B here b4 U know it
827 2018-11-13 22:48:22 Well, typically a 20% drop in oil prices means 0.05 at the pumps with a line of BS about the gasoline now is from 2 years ago due to transport/processing but miraculously in that 2 year time it never drops because of a hurricane or because someone in the pteroleum biz had a cold
828 2018-11-13 22:48:22 Low oil cost grind xD i wasted too much unnecessary oil during FW. Ajax & Leandre kinda a weaker Takao & Belfast.
829 2018-11-13 22:48:19 There’s a lake of oil sitting off Florida, part United States part international. I’m surprised that this does not concern more people. Russia-China-Cuba have wanted to get it for years. If they suck it all over to their side and spill happens guess who’s shores it goes to.

839 2018-11-13 22:47:39 Back in June,2016... Facebook shares dropped... when they had a outage for about 30 minutes... GE fell 7%, $ 8 share each... mounting debt, US oil: modest gains, falling to $59 per barrel, level despite growth by OPEC... mulling a production
840 2018-11-13 22:47:36 Generally rallied on good news for Trade, fell on bad news. Tariffs tossing a wrench into the works. Plus a strong dollar with oil prices fluctuating.
841 2018-11-13 22:47:35 If our gas pump prices stay relatively the same after a 28% decline in oil from the 77$ top to today, I’ll be livid...
842 2018-11-13 22:47:28 Brother don’t I repeat don’t take her back or you’ll regret it.  she might leave you for an oil worker next time.

846 2018-11-13 22:46:59 They would have to manufacture their own fish oil pill as placebo because there's no burp and what not and then people would argue the effects are still skewed but in the opposite direction. I'm sure it was considered to use OTC fish oil by AMRN and FDA.
847 2018-11-13 22:46:55 You can use natural sweeteners with this and use Coconut oil for a healthier bread.  I have a friend with kids who are wheat intolerance and she makes this with othe grains :). There is always a healthier version :)
848 2018-11-13 22:46:48 Super tight. A whole frozen angus prime steak is being cooked/thawed in a pan of oil and water. I’m stressed. Sis comes in and goes str8 for the top tier steaks everytime .
849 2018-11-13 22:46:44 Helps many ppl and I'm all for medicine and rec being legal. I can't use it though -- not good for me -- bad side effects. Def worth the try. Also did CBD oil but no good effects. :*( #legalization

853 2018-11-13 22:46:21 All of the locomotives historically used on this line combusted oil or dirty diesel fuel.

859 2018-11-13 22:45:41 That's last week's gas, next week's gas, after the oil has been processed, will be cheaper.
860 2018-11-13 22:45:35 Is it? I need Christmas ideas!
861 2018-11-13 22:45:31 I like the idea of sharing credit.  Every other hurricane now has a male name.  Since people have been blaming Rachel Notley for low oil prices, I think it is time to blame Jason Kenney.  Mr. Kenney, the drop in oil prices is all your fault! So something! (Wink)

878 2018-11-13 22:43:53 House Democrats could pass a bill banning oil drilling and mandating electric conversions for all vehicles in the United States, and it wouldn't matter because the GOP controlled Senate would never even look at it, and Trump would veto it in any case.

Do away with oil, Beyond oil; Natural Resource, Human Capital Development,
Agriculture, IT.
Restructuring cannot be overemphasised.
We also need to heal from the civil war and forgive each other.
880 2018-11-13 22:43:48 AOC understands perfectly. Remember when Dems reversed their decision to take money from big oil? Remember when Nancy caved on offshore drilling? How much has pelosi said about climate change after the UN report came out on Oct 8th? Not all Dems are the same.

883 2018-11-13 22:43:35 What's relevant right now for oil is @realDonaldTrump imho
884 2018-11-13 22:43:35 considering we would thus be in the EU , considering the non partisan remain percentage in Scotland , I would bet ma left nut it might well be better that the fuckign deal we have now as part of the UK - its not like the EU will take 0ver 92% of our oil now is it?
885 2018-11-13 22:43:30 Whoa! WTI oil is down 7.1% for the DAY. The largest one-day drop since Sept. 1, 2015, when WTI dropped by nearly 8%. Today also marks the 12th consecutive day of decreases for WTI (a record) and the lowest price since last November.

929 2018-11-13 22:39:40 Democrats are sorely lacking in their commitment to climate change, undeniably, but concurrent with this increase in output due to technical disruption not necessarily more oil rigs, was a similar decrease in Kw/hr cost in renewables. The largest decrease in history.
930 2018-11-13 22:39:39 The US isn't to blame for the falling oil prices and mismanagement but it certainly isn't helping. Why would an ethical super power find nations that are struggling, place sanctions on them and try to subvert their government and economy? We know why...oil and power.

941 2018-11-13 22:39:04 and the palm oil that we do use is from Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certified sources. We’re taking steps to ensure the palm oil we buy is produced on legally held land, does not lead to deforestation or loss of peat land, respects human rights -- including land
942 2018-11-13 22:39:01 You might be happy to know that VP Pence lost over $600k in the failed oil business.  You might not be so happy about his brother Greg who ran the business was just elected to Congress in spite of the 6 month old article.
943 2018-11-13 22:38:53 Hi Bella, thank you for your message. We understand that this is an important issue and we take all feedback into consideration. We only use a limited amount of palm oil (to maintain taste, texture and freshness in our soft-centered varieties) when there is no substitute,

947 2018-11-13 22:38:47 Sad the Oil in #Southsudan does not create wealth and prosperity, it rather aggravates poverty, restiveness, corruption, greed and a culture of impunity.
948 2018-11-13 22:38:47 Ok. Thanks everyone for the debate. I now have to go. I will let all of you delude each other in this little echo-chamber of Scottish Nationalism. I think each of you need to study economics to understand the problems with dependency on oil. All the best, Toby.
949 2018-11-13 22:38:41 What is the avg career for an oil field worker? 

How much should they be paid, in your opinion?

What metrics would you use to derive the approximate reasonable  compensation for a job or service?
950 2018-11-13 22:38:09 I totally agree with you. I feel that the oil price will go lower this week, but when we approach the OPEC meeting, the bleeding will stop. And a reverse will take place. I trade oil but I just need your feedback if my ideas are realistic or not. I really appreciate your opinion.
951 2018-11-13 22:37:47 You can not cover up ashyness with cuticle oil when doing nail videos

968 2018-11-13 22:35:31 I have worked in the oil and gas industry for 18 years and the one thing I have learned is that is is a long term game.  Iran sanctions as well as Venezuela production reducing should help to stem the bleeding.  USA fracking is the wild card hard to identify CAPEX over 18 months

970 2018-11-13 22:35:25 What should I think about the oil price crash? @TheProphecarial
971 2018-11-13 22:35:25 منذ تأسيس الدولة #السعودية لم يسبق أن تركزت السلطات في يد فرد واحد مثلما يفعل #محمد_بن_سلمان الآن ، وهذا فيه مغامرة بحكم الأسرة و بالدولة . حتى في عهد الملك عبدالعزيز كان هنالك توزيع معقول للسلطات.
972 2018-11-13 22:35:17 It makes you wonder if @Clearcast and Co are in the pockets of the very people killing our forests. If they won’t do the decent thing we must NO NOT BUY ANY GOODS WITH PALM OIL IN!! #NoPalmOilChristmas
973 2018-11-13 22:35:16 I just had a Hispanic customer wna know how to check his oil & if he needed more. But he can’t speak English. So we just passed his phone back & forth on google translate.
974 2018-11-13 22:35:11 Silly, silly fools.
975 2018-11-13 22:35:07 Well that's it folks, oil price has dropped. Must be something to do with that referendum we're going to be having very very soon. #indyref2 You know because when the price drops it's Scotland's oil. Sod off, we've heard it all before!
976 2018-11-13 22:35:00 and don't be sorry that's part of the game .. but when oil moves it really moves stocks get bought on trendlines OIL just gives a fuck!
977 2018-11-13 22:34:58 does music ever remind ever remind you of a certain artist like certain songs will remind me of Dusty Ray's oil paintings, or like certain song will have me seeing pointillism or maybe im just insane
978 2018-11-13 22:34:56 Interesting. Funny that this is not something more easily known, given the prominence of the “ethical oil” argument?

981 2018-11-13 22:34:35 Err .... NATO and Peace are like oil and water....
982 2018-11-13 22:34:28 Sort of.  It’s also a profit/investment cut for producers.

The “right” economic model for oil is probably nonlinear.  Small declines are +ive for consumer and neutral for producers, large moves are same +ive for consumers but big -ive for producers.
983 2018-11-13 22:34:25 Sharia law and the Constitution can not be said in the same sentence. It’s like oil and water, they just don’t mix.

993 2018-11-13 22:34:00 @DrSimEvans had a good thread on it earlier today. Scale effect largely offsetting technique effect. Lots of energy demand growth (oil and NG) negating most of the electricity supply mix improvement (less coal, more RE+NG)
994 2018-11-13 22:33:52 おは！
995 2018-11-13 22:33:46 Yes, cause the US has it’s head so far up it’s ass that it thinks spending billions of dollars on WMDs is better than figuring out an efficient way to extract/purify water (from our oil filled ocean, thanks to the corporations the gov’t supports). So yeah, we do.

1002 2018-11-13 22:33:12 It would’ve been very interesting if they’d also had a fish oil arm as a placebo (without trying to get to super high EPA doses)
1003 2018-11-13 22:33:01 The train in Oakland goes past oil rigs that inspired some sort of Star Wars creature (I don’t really know which) but despite all that I really love watching them out the window.
1004 2018-11-13 22:32:54 The Oil is in Scottish waters mate.
They wont be able to drill for nothing.
Do you think a British company can just drill wherever they like around thr world without paying the country who territorial waters they belongs too. Nope of course not

1016 2018-11-13 22:31:36 Paying $100 for an oil change when you should be paying $20 is a form of financial illiteracy. 

Don’t @ me.

Fucking hipsters.
1047 2018-11-13 22:29:19 Again, oil demand is falling as shown by the price of oil stocks today (down 7%) and an economy cannot sustain itself on oil and gas, as shown by Venezuela.
1048 2018-11-13 22:29:10 Would you go to the bakery to get the oil changed in your car?  Of course you wouldn’t.  You shouldn’t go to a website that sells advertising for banking institutions and expect a correct credit report and score either.  Only the big 3 bureaus or a mortgage partner can help you.
1049 2018-11-13 22:29:04 Trump doesn't really understand this, like so many things. And he made remarks since at least CPAC 2011 (Hope I remember correctly) where he fantasizes about extorting stuff like oil and natural resources through threats and coercion from other countries. Part of a pattern.
1050 2018-11-13 22:29:02 Remember the last time solar power destroyed a natural habitat? Compare those numbers to the disasters we've had in the last decade alone with oil.
1051 2018-11-13 22:29:02 It seems too obvious. I’m sure there is money to be made in DGAZ but I’m not sure this sees much below 3.7-8 before going higher. And it may take it a month to get to that next trough. It’s energy and in wide ranges retracement takes a while, e.g. oil 2018 and coal 2017. JMO
1052 2018-11-13 22:28:52 HA HAHA it's SO funny because we DO have another choice and it's called "We all die but oil companies get to make a lot of money until then"

1059 2018-11-13 22:28:25 @pepboysauto I’m still amazed that you would hire a mechanic who doesn’t even understand the basic concept of tightening bolts by hand before going balls to the wall with their air drills. And then on top of that trying to charge me $500 for stripping my oil drain plug. Smh.
1060 2018-11-13 22:28:07 It's actually all response-messaging and very restrained compared to previous systems messaging. On the other hand, oil prices tanked over last 2 days #ThisAsWas #This

1066 2018-11-13 22:27:20 But Iceland are committed to removing palm oil in all of their own brand products, which is amazing. They are still a business and as a business will not succeed if they don't continue to offer branded products. It is down to the big brands to stop using palm oil
1067 2018-11-13 22:27:17 Employment in the US is at a 45 year high, the economy is booming like we haven’t seen since the 60’s, we are now the worlds greatest producer of oil, the steel industry is booming and much more. Give up CNN and get some real news. Then you’ll know.

Since then the biggest oil discovery this year has been found West of Shetland.
Also Scotlands West Coast is untapped..exploration drilling estimates upto £1.5 trillion of oil around Scotlands Islands.
You really need to do your research muh man
1072 2018-11-13 22:27:06 It's linked. Price at the pump = crude oil + refining + potential taxes.
1073 2018-11-13 22:27:05 There is no proven beneficial effect of Aromatherapy. Stuff like this is the same stupid shit as healing crystals, just snake oil, selling to the gullible.

How does diffusing essential oil "cleanse" and "purify" the air? Where do the unclean and impure particles go?
1074 2018-11-13 22:27:00 Me this weekend: hell yeah I’ll ball out on an $80 sweater and bomb food, no problem 
 
Me doing getting tooth fillings and an oil change: uhhh... is it REALLY necessary???

1076 2018-11-13 22:26:58 Have you taken any long oil and short natty positions? Have been patient thus far and have not taken any positions yet but today was very tempting...capitulation???

1079 2018-11-13 22:26:46 The idea of Greenpeace objecting to Canadian pipelines but no one else’s , Canadian oil tankers but no one else’s is preposterous!
1080 2018-11-13 22:26:46 @NancyPelosi and the Establishment Dems are tainted with toxic #bigOil money...sure Nancy thrilled to have young people arrested who are trying to fight for Big Oil...sure Exxon sending a check STAT
1081 2018-11-13 22:26:40 Explanation: When the price of oil goes down, the gas in the station was purchased at a higher price so they have to charge based on that. When the price of oil goes up, the cheaper price they paid for the gas in the ground, um, Squirrel!!!
1082 2018-11-13 22:26:29 We don’t fuck with palm oil outchea b
1083 2018-11-13 22:26:25 The ONLY problem with this is that Iceland still sell non-own-brand products containing palm oil. A VERY positive step to remove palm oil from your own brand products but what % of your overall stock does that account for? #StepInTheRightDirection
1084 2018-11-13 22:26:10 Fuck deforestation, fuck palm oil. #SavetheOrangutan
1085 2018-11-13 22:26:02 @BKBrianKelly @grassosteve @timseymour @GuyAdami great discussion on oil, valid points. But, like BK said, has that much changed in y weeks? Looks like top oil nations playing chicken, how low can they send crude. RSI oversold
1086 2018-11-13 22:25:59 Rub gently with palm oil.

1099 2018-11-13 22:24:39 Tribalism on a granular level is very corrosive. It's source of most problems in KRG including dual administration.

1122 2018-11-13 22:22:45 Yep, and it’s up to shoppers now too. In @IcelandFoods you have the power to vote with your wallet by choosing own-brand over brands that use unsustainable palm oil. @IcelandRichard & team have given their customers the choice. Now we can make it more profitable to do good.
1123 2018-11-13 22:22:40 I really spent money on an oil change to find out more problems with my car and now I can’t drive it

1125 2018-11-13 22:22:34 General service is way more than just an oil and air filter change. People often confuse them, cheap it out and then have maintenance issues later on.

1127 2018-11-13 22:22:32 Well, today it closed even lower than that.
But there is a difference and it should be obvious. 

Today's low WCS oil price is temp & due to local triggers that the industry can deal with if they have the will, unlike the global collapse of oil prices in 2015/16.

1131 2018-11-13 22:22:20 Europe's leaders are likely chuckling at the thought of starting another World War just to send their own off to battle to die for oil for the leaders' amusement, or some other horrible reason GG Europe people, you learned nothing from World War 1 because you elected these people

You guys NEED to have Top-Rated analysts speaking, they know. You guys are just guessing. Also buying $AAPL & high-PE Techs was BAD ADVICE too
1145 2018-11-13 22:21:40 @kevinmuir am I a crazy conspiracist or was oil weaponized for this China trade war, and the Iran sanctions lift plus U.S inventory builds / production / SPR release ....icing on the cake.

1147 2018-11-13 22:21:30 I got them online but might try making some. They are just cotton cloth, wax and jojoba oil
1148 2018-11-13 22:21:20 It ridiculous this was banned. The sooner the other supermarkets follow Iceland example and have palm oil free products the better
1149 2018-11-13 22:21:17 I can't understand why the small (36 days) strategic petroleum reserve is strategic. It is a tactical oil reserve, designed to meet a small emergency. Our oil in the ground is the real strategic oil reserve. When it's gone, no more strategy. Stop pumping it away for quick profit.

= Root cause of that migration
1153 2018-11-13 22:21:00 And look who’s fucking drilling for it!!! TOTAL, a French oil company hahahaha.
1154 2018-11-13 22:20:58 "Rich countries" "Turkey"... that was surprised me. I'm Turkish and I can clearly say we are even not close to be rich  But this is not about to oil reserves, just we are simply lazy. 
1155 2018-11-13 22:20:57 what's really fun is that's probably not even going to do it. We're going to have to leave like $130T worth of oil in the ground forever, and tell everyone who has a financial stake in that to suck it
1156 2018-11-13 22:20:55 Yes. Keep fighting the fight. Do not give into the ‘big oil’. 

However just to be fair.....you can’t take UBER anymore, nor planes, trains and automobiles. Not even rubber wheels so there goes the bikes.

1163 2018-11-13 22:20:19 Road crude oil down today! @realsamseiden   Now it’s at our level !!!!  What you thinking 
1164 2018-11-13 22:20:17 Palm oil. Meat. Dairy. Animal products. Avoid unnecessary plastic where possible....all hurt either the environment, our health, other sentient beings or all 3.
1165 2018-11-13 22:20:17 DJT IS SUPER smart to trick the Saudi and Russian to max their production in return for oil sanction against Iran, then give 8 waivers to all Iran’s customers. Now, OPEC meeting next month will reverse its policy and starts to cut production aggressively.
1166 2018-11-13 22:20:16 cocoa butter shea butter sweet almond oil
1167 2018-11-13 22:20:12 That's very true.  There are loads of ways of describing it incl SLS (sodium laureate sulphates) can be derived from palm oil and even if it says 'vegetable oil' it could be palm oil.
1168 2018-11-13 22:20:09 Every time you go to get an oil change they tell you your car is gonna explode or some shit.. well let this bitch blow cause all I got is this $31
1169 2018-11-13 22:20:05 They freak out over oil being low because of their lower profit. The people in the middle you know the deplorables? They get a great break.   It is going to aid their pocketbooks.
1170 2018-11-13 22:20:02 Rising production and a softening in U.S. oil sanctions on Iran, that included waivers for big crude importers like China, helped to contribute to a whipsaw lower for oil prices.
1171 2018-11-13 22:20:01 What oil cleanser do you use? I need to give this a go.
1172 2018-11-13 22:19:52 So would all right-minded people. But it's a complex issue as other oil plants would take up more space. So really all consumer products are a problem.
1173 2018-11-13 22:19:51 The down day for oil marked the 12th consecutive decline, the longest series of losses for the commodity since WTI started trading in 1983. Monday marked an 11th straight loss for the contract.
1174 2018-11-13 22:19:36 Expos were preferred to Jays in baseball. Take this poll 40 years ago and favoured team maybe Detroit. Wings held training camps here and Edmonton was Detroit territory before the draft. Oil Kings belonged to Detroit and grads played with the Wings farm club, the Edmonton Flyers.
1175 2018-11-13 22:19:35 getting my oil changed and they told me I also have to flush out my power steering fluid and get a new air filter too, so I've decided to get rid of all my belongings and go into the wilderness

1179 2018-11-13 22:19:09 Please remember, oil is not enough to sustain an economy as shown by Venezuela. Oil demand is weakening as shown by the 7% drop in value JUTS TODAY. P.s what does Johnston Press share price have anything to do with it?
1180 2018-11-13 22:19:06 Oil prices sank on Tuesday, with U.S. benchmark crude settling at its lowest year-to-date, stretching its record streak of losses to a 12th session, and global benchmark crude officially entering a bear market.
1181 2018-11-13 22:19:05 The price of gasoline is already obscenely high at the pumps compared to the price of oil. Cut the price at the pumps first you greedy bastard.
1182 2018-11-13 22:18:57 oh!イル
1183 2018-11-13 22:18:57 No sé si es lo mejor, porque el gas no es técnicamente un commodity. Vale eso en USA, acá puede valer más o menos. Los contratos firmados con Chile (6/7% de la producción son por us$ 4-4.30). Q tenga buen precio asegura q habrá inversión. Pero sería bueno q el oil no baje más
1184 2018-11-13 22:18:46 I've never seen you be so right about something as you've been about oil in the last two weeks.
1185 2018-11-13 22:18:46 Right. Right. He’s like Trump. Good at being a snake oil salesman and telling people what they want to hear. Using half-truths and lies. We need to win that fight, but the operative word is fight. It’s hard when he’s invited to do keynotes at ANA masters events.

1191 2018-11-13 22:17:41 @AldiUK Shocked and disappointed that @AldiUK is the worst supermarket for using products containing palm oil. Do you intend to change this and if so, when? #stopusingpalmoil #SavetheOrangutan #haveaconscience
1192 2018-11-13 22:17:41 oil opex tomorrow. 33.4k put OI on $55 strike. loads of put OI above that. tomorrow will be interesting
1193 2018-11-13 22:17:26 Shall we go back to the confab report of 2014? 
Take the realistics, 
Do away with oil, Beyond oil; Natural Resource, Human Capital Development,
Agriculture, IT.
Restructuring cannot be overemphasised.
We also need to heal from the civil war and forgive each other.

I thought selling products containing #PalmOil should be against your company values. I hope you'd change that. Thank you.
1199 2018-11-13 22:16:36 ~ okay after owning my beepopper car for over fourteen years, all of a sudden i can’t get an oil change anywhere for less than four times what i paid until now… that ain’t happenin.
1200 2018-11-13 22:16:34 Oil is officially in a bear market now Bad luck for the mullahs

What's the going rate for a barrel on the Iranian black market now?

Mullahs needing cash since currency markets and their foreign assets are frozen?

You could lose your fortune and freedom if you support terrorism
1201 2018-11-13 22:16:28 Usually anything with Argan oil in it.
1202 2018-11-13 22:16:14 And to finish off this perfect cheesecake...<drizzles olive oil until ruined>
1203 2018-11-13 22:16:09 Our instructor told a story where student had a pair of pants that were black from the drain oil be used as bar oil in his chainsaw. he gave the student a new pair of pants and then proceeded to cut through his old ones showing him how little protection he had.
1204 2018-11-13 22:16:07 Actually, that's only the second report that was made to the IMB. There are much more incidents which makes Nigeria so complicated for shipping companies and companies involved in offshore oil&gas production. Let me know if you plan a more comprehensive story.
1205 2018-11-13 22:15:55 If you’re putting a car away for the approaching winter, make sure you complete tasks when you take it out in spring. You’ll absolutely want to complete an oil change and check the battery.
1206 2018-11-13 22:15:55 If you’re putting a car away for the approaching winter, make sure you complete tasks when you take it out in spring. You’ll absolutely want to complete an oil change and check the battery.

1209 2018-11-13 22:15:35 Although more studies are needed to determine exactly what role omega-3s play in depression, it's possible that fish oil supplements high in omega-3s may help lower the risk of depression — and omega-3 fatty acids help reduce high triglyceride levels and may help protec the heart
1210 2018-11-13 22:15:31 Stop oil and gas exploration and extraction on the coasts.
1211 2018-11-13 22:15:30 this female in front of me smells like fried oil and and dirt :(((((((((((((
1212 2018-11-13 22:15:26 all three points are well taken.  
but: we have seen this switch before: dry/wet/dry wet  
as for oil in the Permian: it started with locking up leases, then companies got red or wrote off expensive assets, and moved on. Wow, cost decreased!
1213 2018-11-13 22:15:25 I rarely play supp anymore due to me proving I am a WAY better JG, but I always hated to lane with Ezreals. Cockiest bastards who flame you the rest of the game if you fuck up once.
1214 2018-11-13 22:15:19 Absolute scenes when they fuck the Irish border, North Sea fisheries and oil, fast track independence.
1215 2018-11-13 22:15:14 You need anointing oil
1216 2018-11-13 22:15:05 I’m trying my first pre-poo and it’s an oil mixture. Excited to see what this does for my hairs moisture #NaturalHairTwitter
1217 2018-11-13 22:15:00 I like cooking shows... But then Jamie Oliver sort of ruined it for me with his 30 minute meals & his overuse of olive oil  seriously, no one needs to use half a bottle in a salad...
1218 2018-11-13 22:15:00 9000 miles over for the oil change but I’m probably only responsible for like 800
1219 2018-11-13 22:14:59 What's the baby oil for?
1220 2018-11-13 22:14:58 You must oil!!
1221 2018-11-13 22:14:56 Just tried peppermint oil for my headache and I’m now addicted.
1222 2018-11-13 22:14:54 You don't always agree, but you he's 100% on all issues. Got it, says the CEO of an Energy company!  You can't make this stuff up folks. Google oil supplies and check the 20% price fall. You always agree w Wilson btw! Tragic
1223 2018-11-13 22:14:53 Also, this doesn't work if the fibers get matted from the bar oil or dirt. You have to keep the pants clean so the fibers can jam the sprocket
1224 2018-11-13 22:14:52 Oil is being phased out. Who I’ll buy Scottish oil in 20 years?
1225 2018-11-13 22:14:49 Anil Agarwal got oil out of BJP and mines out of BJD before bailed out by Congress #MakeInOdisha2018
1226 2018-11-13 22:14:45 Also where is the evidence that mineral oil interfere with statin intake? Statins are taken at night, placebo in the morning, gimme a break! That placebo nonsense was concocted a while ago by shorts. Stock should resume $50 trajectory.
1227 2018-11-13 22:14:40 Oil tankers continue having their way with state of the art warships
1228 2018-11-13 22:14:37 I apologize for making you, a hard working, oil patch wife the recipient of my verbal diarrhoea. But once it starts, you just can’t stop it.
1229 2018-11-13 22:14:34 Oil stimulus is now a bullish argument on FM. Earlier today it was bad -- global slowdown. Which is it?
1230 2018-11-13 22:14:33 ik heb al gans mijn leven gehoord dat er peak oil is, dat olie nog 10j beschikbaar is blabla...
Het enige dat er gebeurt is dat de boringen dieper in zee gaan,en dat het altijd maar duurder wordt om nog extra energie uit de grond te halen, 

maar we blijven het maar doen hé
1231 2018-11-13 22:14:31 You are truly the most effective American President ever, crude oil settled at 55.69 lowest price in a year, CRICKETS bet the ungrateful turnaround haters the greedy unthankgivng cabal of the hard left MSM won't give any mention, your calls & requests have been nearly prophetic

1236 2018-11-13 22:14:19 Listening to Mac DeMarco’s music makes me want to shop at sprouts and get non gmo organic coconut cooking oil. Wow such a vibe 
1237 2018-11-13 22:14:17 Oil is defs the way to go! 
1238 2018-11-13 22:14:08 CBD oil!
1239 2018-11-13 22:14:06 Nancy Pelosi don’t care about the American people, if she did she wouldn’t be catering 2the oil companies &deflecting from real issues. she wants 2get paid 4betray the American people.

1241 2018-11-13 22:13:52 Yes but granut oil is the best
1242 2018-11-13 22:13:41 Globe is swamped with oil since before 1st we, the rhetoric out of all this evolves around distraction politics  , arms sales, contracts, and divisions and petty swipes of players and participants , from a distance those forced to speak on it exacerbate it.

1244 2018-11-13 22:13:38 My mom won’t get gas from Valero because they use oil from Venezuela, and she won’t go to Carl’s Jr. because their advertising is sexualized.

I refuse to see the new Star Wars movies simply because everyone makes such a big deal about them.
1245 2018-11-13 22:13:36 We were just informed from one of the largest US Processors that we can now take #CBD (Hemp Oil) for both online and retail sales. Please PM me or @NRuggieri617 for more info.
1246 2018-11-13 22:13:34 I LOATHE dealing with car stuff.. oil changes, brakes, pumping gas, cleaning my windows lmao... everything!!
1247 2018-11-13 22:13:26 That looks like a combination of black oil sunflower & safflower seeds on the platform?
1248 2018-11-13 22:13:18 Less energy sector expenditures & employment, less household & corporations income, less consumption, net negative effect to GDP as seen following last oil slump of Dec14. Also, higher interest rate=higher household income, more consumption; not so bad.

1251 2018-11-13 22:13:03 I'm glad you mentioned Energy East. What is going on with that?  I'm so confused why we import oil that we could be getting from within the country! Energy East just makes sense!
1252 2018-11-13 22:12:59 Yaaass! Coconut oil never fails - plus, you get to smell like a summer vacay even during the wintery weather. 
1253 2018-11-13 22:12:58 EZ shares +1%, US shares -0.1%..initially up on Kudlow comments re trade talks but oil -7.7% weighed on energy stocks.

£ up on draft Brexit deal but long way to go
1254 2018-11-13 22:12:56 The problem is, brands which claim to be using sustainable palm oil have been exposed as sourcing from suppliers which are driving deforestation. So no one can have faith in @RSPOtweets claims. Besides sustainable producers are still operating on land that was once rainforest.
1255 2018-11-13 22:12:50 our ancestors lived to hundred of years eating just palm oil ..
1256 2018-11-13 22:12:50 Okay...organic castor oil for the skin and I use a little brow powder for a more fuller look but my eyebrows are naturally that width. The hairs are long
1257 2018-11-13 22:12:42 Me questiono se no dia que o oil men morrer vai ser noticiado no jornal.
1258 2018-11-13 22:12:34 Oh ok I have an ugly scar on my hand I’ve Been trying to get rid of I’ve just been rubbing vitamin e oil on it lol
1259 2018-11-13 22:12:22 Just realised how shocking the use of palm oil is. It's got to stop! Will be shopping @IcelandFoods and @TheBodyShopUK to try and do my bit. As they say, every little help. Gutted I'm going to have to give up biscuits.

1264 2018-11-13 22:12:10 @FordTrucks why can't I buy accessories for my truck using Ford pass then pick up the accessories on the go from my local dealership? I think it would be wise to be able to order things like my oil filter to floor mats. .

1267 2018-11-13 22:11:50 But @Nestle uses "responsibly sourced palm oil!" @GodsSweetTweets surely you mean Hershey or one of those other heathenish companies! Nestle can't support @FoxNews cuz I like their Tollhouse Cookies. Say it ain't so, Henri! ..and the others currently on the board of directors..
1268 2018-11-13 22:11:45 If youre into woke political satire i highly recommend patriot act with @hasanminhaj his segmant on oil was very informative and just all around good.

1270 2018-11-13 22:11:34 King,
I'm a white guy but I was very ashy.  Your advice on Vaseline/moisturizer was right on - I now use almond oil = Make me shine!  Now, I look wavy....
1271 2018-11-13 22:11:29 people care so much about palm oil because it destroys the homes of orangutans but will happily keep eating meat and supporting dairy industry. ok! I see you prioritising some animals’ lives over others!
1272 2018-11-13 22:11:16 EVERYBODY should "fear" triple-digit oil prices
what's wrong with you people?

1273 2018-11-13 22:11:13 Sorry ten years for North Sea oil.
1274 2018-11-13 22:11:01 I did this, although i'd be happy with oil being drunk, it pissing it all over the driveway however...
1275 2018-11-13 22:11:00 Yet another reason the Oil Robber Barons to embrace Sustainable Energy
1276 2018-11-13 22:10:58 “But palm oil uses fewer resources and takes up less land than other types of vegetable-based oil, and only contributes to 1/8th of deforestation worldwide” he shouted into a row of chest freezers
1277 2018-11-13 22:10:56 It’s official. Walmart vehicle service center is the SLOWEST place on the planet. Been here an hour and a half for an oil change.
1278 2018-11-13 22:10:55 Great to see so many signing the petition in favour of showing the Iceland TV advert but how many of them have given up buying products containing Palm Oil?
1279 2018-11-13 22:10:50 Eh, our defense lobby loves that we spend the extra money to protect other countries and the defense lobbies own the Republican Party.  That’s why we have bases everywhere, that and to protect corporate interest such as oil in the Middle East. Essentially our military members
1280 2018-11-13 22:10:48 Pls Abeg don’t even lie. Eru is never protein don’t come and be calling big grammer thinking u have done it. Beside granut oil greatly recommended than red oil.
1281 2018-11-13 22:10:47 I switched to an oil cleanser and started using rose water + glycerine. LEMME TELL YOU BOUT THE GOD I SERVE!!

1284 2018-11-13 22:10:35 I bought physical bud instead of my THC oil because I can make the bud last longer, but I’ve been sick for the past 3 days and my bud doesn’t affect me, but I get pretty stoned off my oil. in summary, I regret all of my life decisions
1285 2018-11-13 22:10:27 Today in 2015 @TimothyPeters_ in the @RedHorseRacing Toyota won the Lucas Oil 150 @ISMRaceway. @RedHorseRacing #NASCAR
1286 2018-11-13 22:10:22 I pull my hair back and rub coconut oil into my face and neck. It's something I have on hand at all times and works beautifully! My skin has never looked better!!!

1288 2018-11-13 22:10:18 Would love if you could offer oil changes at a discount rate.. great fundraiser.
1289 2018-11-13 22:10:08 Hey, can someone please point this out to that idiot Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. She is stirring the liberal pot by suggesting that we quit using oil altogether, you know, that commodity that is fueling 1/3 of our economy....
1290 2018-11-13 22:10:04 I am capitalism and my anatomy is the anatomy of a monster, I breathe fire, I consume oil, I tinker with your pretty brains.

1292 2018-11-13 22:10:01 Skip the bamboo oil.  Use mineral oil and press between parchment or stretch wrap.  Keeps it cheaper and just as effective.
1293 2018-11-13 22:09:37 Bro all palm oil is bad for our bodies also it's in all junk food pretty much @oreo @littledebbie corporate Muthafuckas
1294 2018-11-13 22:09:31 Yo, I went in to get a new battery/oil change for my car.. these bitches called me talking about your brakes are at 5% and that’ll be $205 to replace. Like sweetie I don’t even have to press all the way down on my brakes for my car to stop.. I’m good, love.

1297 2018-11-13 22:09:27 First time you've mentioned the oil price for a while? September wasn't it? Wonder why that might be. Oil price goes up, media mentions of the oil price goes down. (unless it's about petrol/diesel prices that is) Oil price goes down, media chatter on oil goes up.
1298 2018-11-13 22:09:04 The only people who benefit from the hydrogen economy are the oil and petrochemical companies that make the stuff.
1299 2018-11-13 22:09:00 Absolutely. Europe has got its house in order. Data is the new oil and whilst used with the right intentions can help society, 99.9% of the time it will be exploited.
1300 2018-11-13 22:08:59 You also destroyed the Middle East and created millions of refugees, you also steal oil and take out leaders you don't like. You'll soon be broke, wait, you already are!
1301 2018-11-13 22:08:57 They should be able to say. Just make sure it's had an oil change recently. I'm not an expert but with it being auto think the oil needs changing in the gear box possibly by that age. Don't quote me on that!!
1302 2018-11-13 22:08:56 There’s just something about palm oil stew that speaks to me on a different level 
1303 2018-11-13 22:08:54 9 months and soon a real cat .. sits on the printer looks at me while i get cut trying to catch the bottom in oil ..
1304 2018-11-13 22:08:47 I should say I need my oil changed or something so they can do it for me

1308 2018-11-13 22:08:23 Those are great! I have matching toolboxes in both vehicles, air compressor, high vis vest, cold steel Spetsnaz shovel, spare oil, and some odds and ends. Toolboxes are big enough and durable enough to sit on while changing tires etc.
1309 2018-11-13 22:08:18 Yall do know American Cheese is oil based not dairy based...
1310 2018-11-13 22:08:18 @realDonaldTrump Oil is the LOWEST in a year/despite the Iran sanctions/due to the glut! Gas is 2.68/gal average/here in CA it’s close to $4 gal/some places over $4/will only keep rising/due to the CA Democrat socialist state! Voters who voted in Democrats in your state/CA soon!

1313 2018-11-13 22:08:02 FINALLY found this. Which gives the best outcome - butter or coconut oil? Thanks for posting the recipe!
1314 2018-11-13 22:08:01 Also she's right. No one should sit on that committee if they take money from oil companies.

1318 2018-11-13 22:07:38 Go elsewhere if its out of warranty
But careful about the oil they use
1319 2018-11-13 22:07:32 @Minister_Harwin What has this to do with energy? Where are your calculations on (a) the CO2 free power supply for all the residential towers the government is approving? (b) the oil and fuel supply for Westconnex and other road tunnels, Badgerys Creek airport?  For many decades?
1320 2018-11-13 22:07:31 The shea butter and sea buckthorn oil are the only answers. 
1321 2018-11-13 22:07:29 Or cannabis. Cannabis oil futures; that should give them a bit of a boost...
1322 2018-11-13 22:07:09 パンさんおはようございます！
1323 2018-11-13 22:07:03 Oil is over priced as it is. We won't need as much the closer we get to renewable energy and you know it.
1324 2018-11-13 22:07:02 Yep. Happened today. That makes 4 oil and gas related fires or explosions in Colorado in the last 6 weeks. #colorado #oilandgas #denver #fortcollins #ColoradoSprings
1325 2018-11-13 22:06:59 Another shoe to drop - Russian ofz bet. Many factors against big crowded unhedged fx bet - raising usd rates, crashing oil, coming sanctions. Miraculous trade surplus will oversudden disappear and even dec hike from cbr won’t compensate capital outflow
1326 2018-11-13 22:06:56 i thought this said oil pants yum
1327 2018-11-13 22:06:53 How much was your oil leak to fix??
1328 2018-11-13 22:06:51 What's your opinion on Omega via fish oil. By Doctor Vin Kutty ?
1329 2018-11-13 22:06:49 Thanks for your answer  the fall in crude oil today was big. Maybe the falling trend will stop when we approach the OPEC meeting in December. Do you share the same thoughts? Many thanks for sharing your ideas 
1330 2018-11-13 22:06:38 The money Nigeria makes yearly from crude oil is more than the aid given to Africa.
1331 2018-11-13 22:06:33 Those macro/commods funds did a number of oil/natty today...
1332 2018-11-13 22:06:32 No but that’s a prediction from geologists. ‘Little Norway’ manages because it has a lot more oil than you do.
1333 2018-11-13 22:06:21 All this after 35 years as a hostage'.this is what I get for trying to escape and trying to.aquire proper law enforcement help. And the oil.leajs and water.leaks just started after I started thinking about getting to Mexico to the embassy '.
1334 2018-11-13 22:06:13 We don't want to drink you crappy wine neither burn oil to import it when we can make some good here !
1335 2018-11-13 22:06:08 It makes me so happy that people are finally paying attention to palm oil
1336 2018-11-13 22:05:46 It’s foul!  Shouldn’t be allowed to be called chocolate - real chocolate doesn’t contain palm oil!
1337 2018-11-13 22:05:45 Retinol, which hazel and tea tree oil dat mf

1340 2018-11-13 22:05:29 Ugh no. Garlic with garlic things. Like starch. Raw garlic tossed with olive oil and fresh pasta, for example.
1341 2018-11-13 22:05:24 I think it is time for the oil futures to put "blockchain" in their name.
1342 2018-11-13 22:05:22 Australian has and oil companies calling for a #carbontax

1344 2018-11-13 22:05:19 @Oreo stop using dirty palm oil.  Save the #Rainforests
1345 2018-11-13 22:04:58 I lean that they are done. I like OIL long and Natty short from here.
1346 2018-11-13 22:04:57 3 eggs and half a pint of milk whisked like mad till frothy - I do mine in the kitchen aid. Gradually add 115g plain flour. Chill the mix for at least an hour. Preheat oil until volcanic and pour in batter. Close oven door GENTLY
1347 2018-11-13 22:04:37 Oil plunging today...adding to it's longest losing streak in history...are these low prices a good thing? We'll debate next!
1348 2018-11-13 22:04:33 Apparently something to do with Long Island City and Northern Virginia. Oh, oil is down, BTW.
1349 2018-11-13 22:04:20 It's obviously irrelevant that leading cardiologists say the mineral oil issue is a very minor one.
1350 2018-11-13 22:04:13 Hey Jared, our avocado oil shampoo helps to smooth spit ends and at the same time, adds a brilliant shine. Since it has plant based fatty acids it has the unique ability to have long lasting effects. Hope that answers your 'friends' question #WholeBlends

Your Soul my dear, will Know No Solace
1353 2018-11-13 22:04:02 Cluster headaches are no joke. They can get really extreme. You might find success in using CBD oil like others have.

Middle aged woman in a pyramid scheme, bursting through my wall like the Kool-Aid man: STOP USING WESTERN MEDICINE, IT'S INFECTING YOUR DREAMS. IF YOU CAN'T SLEEP AT NIGHT JUST PUT THREE DROPS OF ESSENTIAL OIL IN THIS DIFFUSER AND YOU'LL WAKE UP FEELING FULLY RESTED.

1359 2018-11-13 22:03:45 2/2

Even if it could, Trudeau’s plan gives oil producers a taxpayer funded pipeline, our oil output capacity will more than triple, and Canadians get a tax and inflation as a result of that tax in return. That sounds like a game.
1360 2018-11-13 22:03:38 why is oil paint so expensive 
1361 2018-11-13 22:03:34 still don’t understand why an oil change costs me 70$ 
1362 2018-11-13 22:03:28 Oh god mate . Never thought about the price of oil
1363 2018-11-13 22:03:28 @TheJuanWilliams you know I use to think you were just stupid, but have been watching you and your hero Obama. He is a snake oil salesmen and your the mule that pulled the wagon.
1364 2018-11-13 22:03:22 Oil is in a no-win situation: Low price, no profit, high price accelerating ICE death clock. 

Tesla is in win-win: High price, faster adoptation, low price, reduced oil production, leading to high price, leading to faster adoption.

2008.
1366 2018-11-13 22:03:16 I think that they wanted to attack Iran, Russia and Venezuela economically and thought that shale was a means of doing so.

They intentionally increased oil production globally in an attempt to harm these countries economies. 

It was beyond myopic, and the same goals could have

1370 2018-11-13 22:02:30 The Saudis are kissing everyone’s ass for something that went awry with an outspoken journalist that they would like to bury under a flood of gushing OPEC oil....
1371 2018-11-13 22:02:27 70's Britain was shit, I was there, shit food,shit economy, shit prospects. Olive oil could only be bought in chemists. Worst of all we had to watch the Black and White Minstrel show.
1372 2018-11-13 22:02:21 @GuyAdami @CNBCFastMoney 1. When was lower oil bad for anything in only good for everything economically companies. 2Why start off with negativity on the desk across. There’s a lot of positives that’s all I’m gonna say. Hopefully you talk about them. FUNDAMENTALS!
1373 2018-11-13 22:02:20 I hated oil in late august and early september.  Ouch.  I hate absolutely hate the dollar here (also for about a month now)

I have learned about peace. you are? That is only a cliche. You’re ignorant. At that time the United States offered oil supply and economic sanctions against Japan. As a result, Japan was horsebacked to make it catch up and make a first strike.
1390 2018-11-13 22:00:38 The corporatists have a full court press out on Venezuela right now. Sooner or later you know they'll succeed in assassinating Maduro and taking over the oil there, which is all they care about.

1401 2018-11-13 22:00:14 Into shale oil and gas? At first I thought it creates a price ceiling. Saudi and established oil exporters create a price floor.

The thought crossed my mind about banks' involvement. Maybe another subprime disaster? This time on wells that don't deliver?
1402 2018-11-13 22:00:11 Palm oil has been destroying the orangutans habitat for years, yet one advert for Iceland gets pulled and suddenly everyone is a fucking eco warrior. I'm sure the orangs appreciate your indignance. OOK

1410 2018-11-13 21:58:58 And wtf of the civilians? They only marry children anyway. A pedophile culture forced on innocents enforced by sadistics. Too many duck and weave over oil and what others think than use global overwhelming peer pressure on matters. Ask Latifa #freeLatifa
1411 2018-11-13 21:58:57 why is nobody talking about the Taylor Energy Co oil spill? 300-700 barrels of oil per day for FOURTEEN years. this ecological disaster is tremendously underreported

1430 2018-11-13 21:56:40 Depends on which Classical Greeks we're talking about. Athenians (whose vast trading and raiding fleets were their main means of livelihood, transport, and everything else) probably thought it would be weird not to board a ship to get home from buying a bottle of olive oil.
1431 2018-11-13 21:56:25 Ameen ya rabbbb
1432 2018-11-13 21:56:15 Have to argue with this - in PA it takes like 1 year for gas prices to fall when oil falls - not 12 days lol!  Only takes 2 hours for prices to go up though...

1438 2018-11-13 21:55:04 Yeah.. I drink extra virgin olive oil just to keep away my virginity from these hoes
1439 2018-11-13 21:55:04 It is fish oil, not magic pill.
1440 2018-11-13 21:55:01 quick recipe: wash and prep kale, toss with olive oil that is pre mixed with salt and seasoning of your choice (I like madras curry powder), spread out on pan, oven at 350 10 mins done usually makes a bowl with an even covering of an oven pan pre cooking (they shrink a lot)
1441 2018-11-13 21:55:01 I lox olive oil and dish soap and dip my brushes. Then I get my little silicone cleaning board thing and run the water over them while I rub them on the board
1442 2018-11-13 21:54:54 just get past the CPI tomorrow .. then load the boat with TLT calls. if the Fed flips to data driven dovish hike... they will be done for awhile.  take a gander at CRB, Oil, etc.. then wave in 25% tarrifs?
1443 2018-11-13 21:54:53 I bet there is a Farsi equivalent to "perfidious Albion".  Years ago I saw an Iranian TV soap in which there was a older character Uncle something, who saw the scheming hands of the Brits behind everything that went wrong.  Legacy of Anglo-Iranian Oil, and the "Great Game".
1444 2018-11-13 21:54:45 Have a Pax 3 here and really dig it. Does flower and wax depending on the insert you use. Smokes well and you can reuse the flower for edibles later on. Oil cartridges are nice and portable, but seems to take forever & has a different feeling result

1449 2018-11-13 21:54:05 Why has the market for #palmoil exploded over the last 20yr? Is it all price-switching and profit margin? Bc many products were made without it, and now few are. Do you have reports of papers you’d suggest on this? The “it’s palm oil or other worse alternatives” fails to convince
1450 2018-11-13 21:54:05 @HaloTopUK does your mint chip contain palm oil? It states Vegetable Glycerin as one of the ingredients. Really want to try your ice cream but don’t want to buy palm oil products. TIA

Also, are you a petroleum exploration geologist that you know how long oil reserves will last, and have a crystal ball to foresee that no new petroleum will be found?
1456 2018-11-13 21:53:31 Tech is up, oil is down, the dollar slumped against the pound but the yen climbed to new heights despite global concerns that unemployment is both up and down whilst wages stagnate in an accelerated fashion against global demand for renewable energy bikes linked to Russian unrest
1457 2018-11-13 21:53:23 This whole Brexit (still going on) shit is distracting the masses from something even bigger and evil. We watch the Benny Hill show while Donny Hill and Sergei the meerkat work out who gets the last of the highest land,oil,and all the useless riches.

1461 2018-11-13 21:53:13 You look like the physical embodiment of the phrase "My father could fire you!"  But yeah, I'm sure you cushy civilian deployments were rough, oil slick.
1462 2018-11-13 21:53:10 haven't we heard this before in oil only to find out that they drilled anyway?  The problem is: lower oil prices (if they stay low) will lower oil drilling activities and associated gas production will decline.

1468 2018-11-13 21:52:46 We have 1 ton of CBD oil stuck in the country - send us $5M in itunes cards and it is yours.
1469 2018-11-13 21:52:45 Any one wanna send me money for this $55 oil change
1470 2018-11-13 21:52:41 I done a bit of research tonight online and in my cupboards ,a serious more detailed look at information on products will be had from now on to avoid goods with palm oil use in my weekly shop
1471 2018-11-13 21:52:32 Wait can we have a cute essential oil party and make fun blends and smoke and eat and just b cute
1472 2018-11-13 21:52:18 The combination of WTI price collapse plus already ultra-wide WTI-WCS differentials has sent the flat price of Western Canadian Select to $15.7 a barrel, quickly approaching the 2016 low of $12.9 a barrel. Lots, lots, really lots of pain in #Alberta | #OOTT #Canada #oil
1473 2018-11-13 21:52:18 Lost in today's #OIL rout was the fact that the #OVX went from 35 to close at 55. Highest close since 2016...oh and it touched 95 intraday...highest touch point since 2009!! Today was the wash out. Up from here. #OOTT
1474 2018-11-13 21:52:18 2 teaspoons of coconut oil 
1 teaspoon of vaseline 
1 teaspoon of cinnamon 

Mix all ingredients together and put them into a container. This plumps your lips.

1476 2018-11-13 21:52:10 The oil on my face can be used to fry dodo for a community 
1477 2018-11-13 21:52:08 Boycotting isn't the answer, as the substitutes are more harmfull to the enviroment. Its a culture of change thats required to grow the palm oil in a sustainable manor, rather than cutting down virgin forest thats needed.
1478 2018-11-13 21:52:01 I used vitamin E oil on my face today for the first time & I feel a difference
1479 2018-11-13 21:52:00 Oil prices are down, not gas. Increases get passed to consumers even before they happen. Price drops get passed on in 6 months or so.

1484 2018-11-13 21:51:17 Does anyone on here use #CBDoil or #hemp oil for their pets? And if so, any brand recommendations? My poor Sid needs some pain management and I hate to put him back on gabapentin. That stuff made him a zombie. Hate to see my baby hobbling around in pain.
1485 2018-11-13 21:51:15 Actually that's one of the 2 things "experts" are saying was the problem today and yesterday -- oil prices tanking and China/U.S. unresolved tariff disputes.
1486 2018-11-13 21:51:07 2/ Later, on the bus, the TTC driver breaks suddenly....

..a surprising amount of beard oil remained on my hands.. 

... thus transforming the pole I was holding on to into something that resembles a stripper pole.

How was your day?
1487 2018-11-13 21:51:05 My skin can’t take no oil it already is only the cheeks are losing it
1488 2018-11-13 21:50:47 As long as we continue to supply them with arms I am sure they will continue to supply us with oil. #stopbombingyemen
1489 2018-11-13 21:50:46 I read that as oil and I was so confused.

1498 2018-11-13 21:50:05 I’m about to start doing my own oil changes. These people tax me and add shit on every time 
1499 2018-11-13 21:50:04 I was trying to cook some ground beef and forgot to spread the oil in the pan, and the meat fell and splashed the puddle of oil all over me 
1500 2018-11-13 21:49:50 yes we’ll still have body oil & butters! we’re just going to have a larger variety of products.
1501 2018-11-13 21:49:48 OIL MONEY IS BLOOD MONEY watch who takes it and who doesn't
1502 2018-11-13 21:49:48 Clearly oil was priced too high in relation to global growth. Bubble burst and oil joins deflation of all commodities already seen. Yields follow and Powell can’t stop it.
1503 2018-11-13 21:49:45 Ah well. The oil was nice when it lasted. It'll be running out now.
1504 2018-11-13 21:49:40 Time, alas. They're coming into contact with all sorts of new germs, they have to build up immunity. Zinc tablets may help the afflicted adults; Olbas oil aids sleep and Irish coffee at least makes it all feel better.
1505 2018-11-13 21:49:40 PLEASE MR PRESIDENT, ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS NOT PERMISSIBLE WILL BLACK HORSE TRADING  BE PERMISSIBLE  "SAVE  AFRICAN  OIL ."
1506 2018-11-13 21:49:22 worse for those who backed him on trade and weakened the U.S. globally. Hard to square with making America great again.
In short, the snake oil he sold on the campaign trail has turned out to be, well, snake oil.

Same crap is happening in the UK with the mess called Brexit.
1507 2018-11-13 21:49:21 Boris doing what he does best: See in which direction the crowd begins to move and then jumps in front and says “Follow me!!!”. 

What he’s saying now is the complete opposite of what he claimed before and just after the referendum. 

Snake oil salesman. All of them!!!

1511 2018-11-13 21:49:04 I know I’ve done it like stir fry with some avocado oil, it’s amazeballs.
1512 2018-11-13 21:48:59 Lol ISIS still has a stronghold there. And Israel is awarding oil drilling “rights” there. Even though they illegally occupy it. The company that got the “rights” has a Rothschild family member on its board. Only a fool could believe this trash
1513 2018-11-13 21:48:55 Hot oil splashed all over me 
1514 2018-11-13 21:48:52 U still need to add a small amount of oil in the air fryer on the meat to keep it juicy.. makes all the difference @MattFontana83
1515 2018-11-13 21:48:37 Surely their cannot be a genuine reason Holland cannot include Magnitsky Act in there laws other than someone or more than one member of parliament has financial ties with Putin and his regime and fear repercussion if it's broken, is it Gas and Oil supplies, defensive weapons??
1516 2018-11-13 21:48:28 Smithfield - oil spill bothways Cumberland Highway at Sturt Street
1517 2018-11-13 21:48:24 I hate coming to get an oil change. Or is that I just hate men?  they are pervs!
1518 2018-11-13 21:48:21 Oh lol, I find them annoying. I like some black metal, they're a bit much for me tho. My guess would've been the scream you make when frying chicken and the oil splashes your arm, I guess I was close lol \m/
1519 2018-11-13 21:48:17 So this morning I awake from a disturbing dream.

My beard. Gone.

After assuring myself that this was a nightmare, I treat myself to a generous application of beard oil.

1520 2018-11-13 21:48:10 It's important to remember that Syrian Kurds & their allies want autonomy in a federal Syria. That's all.
If Assad would agree to it, he would get another 60k+ soldiers from the #SDF and get access to the oil & gas fields in eastern Syria. Win-win for everyone.
1521 2018-11-13 21:48:09 Chopped potatoes, slathered in olive oil, thyme and salt. In preparation for roasting underneath the pork rack.
1522 2018-11-13 21:48:04 You have been playing for 10 years and have the half of trophies as De Gea who has been in England for 7 yrs... and you change your historic club for Money Oil FC   you’re the real Glory Hunter
1523 2018-11-13 21:48:04 Reminder that if you're going to drop olive oil all over the kitchen floor, it's probably best to simply pour it straight out of the bottle, as the glass shards really don't help the clean up process at all.
1524 2018-11-13 21:47:54 Try using hair oil any kind right after you shower... Get a wet brush for brushing your hair when its wet and use a paddle brush we your hard is dry. You can probably use extra oil when your hair is dry if it's not too thin... Oh and NO hot irons and no dying your hair !!!

1526 2018-11-13 21:47:49 I like cannabis/ coconut oil & peanut butter & so does my dog.
1527 2018-11-13 21:47:34 You didn't answer the question. Why use palm oil? Orangutans are dying because of human's use of palm oil NOW - every day. Is there no substitute that would work?
1528 2018-11-13 21:47:13 I did a hair mask made of olive oil, honey, salt, and vanilla. Now my hair is suuuuuuuuper soft but it won't stay up in a bun. There is no pleasing me.
1529 2018-11-13 21:47:09 Get a essential oil diffuser & put lemon essential oil in it!
1530 2018-11-13 21:47:08 Please be careful with what you tweet, your killing Texas/crude oil prices, get ready for layoffs! If crude dips below 65 everything comes to a halt,perriod!
1531 2018-11-13 21:47:03 地獄じゃん(地獄じゃん)
1532 2018-11-13 21:46:57 When y’all open again are y’all still gonna havethat chocolate body oil? Or the body butter whips? Or is it gonn be all makeup and skincare now?
1533 2018-11-13 21:46:48 @FoxNews oil prices are down we were down the $2.21 per gallon then today it went to $2.51
In our area I call it price gouging for profit I sent a complaint to the US Attorney General's office because of the price gouging and nobody replied answered my letter email back
1534 2018-11-13 21:46:43 For me trading and investing hats ideally match up, but not always. My value hat says oil fair value is still a lot lower, but trader saying the adjustment was too swift and reversal is due
1535 2018-11-13 21:46:39 It seems in the time it took for me to enjoy a couple puffy tacos in Texas, the floor fell out beneath oil prices. Brent down to $65, WTI to $55.
1536 2018-11-13 21:46:35 If we still need oil in the future we should start pumping raw sewage down into the same oil wells that have been deemed dry wells and let that crap cook for a dozen years or so until it's nice and black and gooey . Whether it still stinks or not- Only time will tell.
1537 2018-11-13 21:46:21 Get the pipeline going we have enough oil to sustain us for 172 years.
1538 2018-11-13 21:46:17 Winning again! Oil prices are down to like $55 a barrel!
1539 2018-11-13 21:46:16 Oil has worst day in 3yrs while nat gas tops $4/mmbtu for first time since 2014.  Correlation betw the 2 long gone.  But what might sustained +$4 gas mean for coal, nukes, and RE?

1546 2018-11-13 21:46:01 so this morning i forgot that coconut oil was um oIL (dont judge me i wake up at 5 in the morning oKAY) and threw some in my book bag and it melted :/
1547 2018-11-13 21:45:53 The sebaceous glands located on my face have decided to start a mass production of cooking oil without my permission.
1548 2018-11-13 21:45:52 If it’s fun, Oil fans will complain about a twitter account being fun if the team sucks, or just complain about it in general. Plus, like literally everything the team does, it keeps things vanilla because we show up and support no matter what. We’ve done this to ourselves.

1565 2018-11-13 21:43:59 Peppermint oil! Use a few drops in the toilet. For some reason, the smell stimulates the ladies to go.
1566 2018-11-13 21:43:44 Many people say that. Please explain why it's sleazy. Seems like a financial adviser in a different venue. Yeah I know many think of them as sleazy too. If my picks were offered in good faith. If I burned the midnight oil and tried to offer a great product. Why is that sleazy?
1567 2018-11-13 21:43:42 Take a shower and oil up.  Might help.
1568 2018-11-13 21:43:35 7% decline today, 9% decline this week so far. Oil price volatility definitely need some curtailment.

1571 2018-11-13 21:43:24 Well the wealth fund, if that’s what you meant, is most made up of financial and industrial stocks, not oil.
1572 2018-11-13 21:43:24 He's a true-believer in his closely held theories, one of which is that oil is only worth ~$20bbl, and any price over that is a rip off. Just like taxes are a rip off of the rich, and loan interest is a scam to take advantage of businesses. He has no interest in knowing otherwise

1580 2018-11-13 21:42:46 @Chuck_and_Julie that gas and oil permit was applied for 8/18 they have pulled the permit from Stanley lake/dog park due to public negative feedback they drill 7000 ft below the  lake. IT WAS AND IS SAFE COGA good info on drilling trust me I know about this

1582 2018-11-13 21:42:24 I'm fine with coming up with alternatives.  After all, we stopped killing whales for oil when they discovered black gold.  But I'm not for TOP DOWN anything as it makes things worse not better.  Be open to innovation and let the market decide.

1595 2018-11-13 21:41:40 This Iceland advert has already raised awareness of palm oil, I just can’t believe how many products contain it. Almost everything... how can we possibly avoid it  manufacturers need to substitute it so we don’t have to #IcelandAdvert

1600 2018-11-13 21:41:21 Incomplete reasoning.  Canadian funding reduces oil supply to increase price.   In US, funding drives anti-nuclear idiocy which gathers market share for gas, byproduct of oil production.   Proportion of funding demonstrates nothing, as there is a strong goal for funding in USA.
1601 2018-11-13 21:41:21 If engineers can construct sewers with laterals, oil & gas pipelines and damn systems, why not an interstate pipeline to move excess water from the flooded south & east to the west? Is there a better use of infrastructure funding? I’ll bet the Dutch could do it.
1602 2018-11-13 21:41:19 @FdeRugy et les médias n'ont effectivement  pas encore réalisé que le ministre #Macron se moquait bien de la pollution due au gas oil pour préférer les bus pétaradants au train...
1603 2018-11-13 21:41:19 George is right, leadership and the public trust are too expensive. I mean, it’s not like we’re the richest country in the world. We should be spending our money on smart stuff like oil subsidies and tax cuts for Donald Trump. Lol
1604 2018-11-13 21:41:10 There doesn't have to be tension between these goals. For example, a government, or governments, could work to both decrease oil demand and increase supply, which could lower overall emissions and avoid price volatility.
1605 2018-11-13 21:41:07 Can't really talk shit about palm oil if u eat meat://
1606 2018-11-13 21:41:06 try MAC face and body foundation or studio sculpt. Or a strobe cream mixed with whatever foundation you’re using. You look like you used a full coverage matte foundation and your oil from your skin is just coming through.
1607 2018-11-13 21:40:58 funny how they talk about "oil money" but their leadership will gladly take that oil money.
1608 2018-11-13 21:40:58 Ah thanks - first tweet left me stumped. There's nothing in the VITAL protocol that indicated the placebos contained mineral oil (which is GRAS and present in many food products), but the big 2 big differences between the VITAL study & the Vascepa study are ->
1609 2018-11-13 21:40:53 if you truly want smaller govt, take a look around, bc in 2018, we can't trust republicans w much of anything, least of all responsible state spending. in AK, R leadership voted in ballooned budgets & then slashed oil tax rate, meaning no future revenue to support state services.
1610 2018-11-13 21:40:50 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
1611 2018-11-13 21:40:50 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

1613 2018-11-13 21:40:45 Oil is difficult to reconcile with what is essentially an ideological position.
1614 2018-11-13 21:40:42 As if we didn't know how easy it was to run a car on deionised water, or even salt water..... oil companies do not own the sea nor is there a profit in the technology that a lot of people have trailed (not me I know nothing i want to stay alive) 
1615 2018-11-13 21:40:40 To be fair, they don't claim to be 100% palm oil free. Just that the products most commonly associated with Christmas have been made so, with their overall goal being to be 100% palm oil free by 2020 (if memory serves correctly). So yeah, there's a full story to find out there

1626 2018-11-13 21:39:59 @theresa_may Mrs Prime Minister why is the government not overruling @Clearcast decision on Iceland advert? This demonstrates to the public that Britain supports the destruction of rainforests and supports British companies processing palm oil

1631 2018-11-13 21:39:34 Before you judge me. One damn facial oil is like 85 bucks okay! And it only lasts like a month so you gotta go buy another one.
1632 2018-11-13 21:39:16 Let them drink their wine and we'll drink oursI make my own so I don't care either way. We also pump our own oil and our gas prices are $2.00 a gallon too high

1635 2018-11-13 21:38:46 I like it roasted and mashed with some minced chipotles en adobo, maybe a teensy bit of maple syrup, if you roll like that. If you're serving the soup as a first course, consider garninshing with a bit of crabmeat and some spiced pumpkin seed oil. (Not that anyone asked me.)

1642 2018-11-13 21:38:20 Veganism cannot address the problem of palm oil. Cattle contributes greater to deforestation than palm oil. 70% of Palm oil cultivation is used  for fuel not food. Palm oil is useful and we need to stop the corporate slaughter of the forest and not replacing it with a monocrop
1643 2018-11-13 21:38:08 Switching from oil to natural gas for our furnace. Gas line/furnace installation delayed, so we’re out of oil. I ask @griffithenergy  for enough oil for two weeks. “Sure! That will be $600-minimum delivery. Thank you.” @griffithenergy, that’s why we’re switching to natural gas.

1646 2018-11-13 21:37:53 Why is palm oil in bread
1647 2018-11-13 21:37:51 99.9% of the time I’m completely familiar with how my car operates and do most things without even  thinking. That .1% is the difference between the windshield wiper switch and the turn signal switch when I’m getting my oil changed and they’re doing a light test.

1649 2018-11-13 21:37:45 After listening to the boss of Iceland explain his stance on palm oil and his reasons for eliminating it from Iceland’s products until he could be sure it is truly sustainable..she appeared to change her mind..

1651 2018-11-13 21:37:41 Cos India for example moved her people seriously out of poverty during that period to 2018 while at the time we sold oil for over  $100/barrel, those in power looted and looted forgetting the poor.
1652 2018-11-13 21:37:38 FloMarching sent out a survey for their services.

1666 2018-11-13 21:36:13 NDP disagrees with you! The oil sands will proceed.
1667 2018-11-13 21:36:09 @JohnBrennan you are a criminal an comparing #norway which has an oil wealth fund a relatively favourable goegeaphical configuration to #Greece is intellectually irresponsible at best
1668 2018-11-13 21:36:05 Not surprisingly large caps took a beating again today. Oil drops another 8%.
1669 2018-11-13 21:35:47 Yes we must boycott nutella and other products with palm oil #Stopdeforestation
1670 2018-11-13 21:35:42 Cratering oil prices will definitely drive UST yields higher
1671 2018-11-13 21:35:39 Think of the flower like crude oil.   The cracking process of crude oil breaks it down into other types of fuels, petroleum products, heating oil, etc etc.  The marijuana extraction process will break  into countless other products as well, cannabinoids, oils, tinctures,  etc etc
1672 2018-11-13 21:35:39 Because if you just get in your car and go you don’t give the oil a chance to run thru the engine.

1676 2018-11-13 21:35:26 And despite all the money coming in from oil and drugs the Maduro regime doesn't care if Venezuelan citizens don't have access to food, water, electricity, health care, education, safety, etc., etc. #ThieveryIncorporated

1678 2018-11-13 21:35:07 Firt thing firts! You need to ban biodiesel that is in some parts of the globe produced from palm oil, and that will decrease the need for palm oil like 75% if not more. Ban car biofuels of 1st generation!!!!
1679 2018-11-13 21:35:03 I don’t know if Trump has a badass market technician in the White House or if he really moves markets but this $oil tweet knocked the price like 10% .

1689 2018-11-13 21:33:47 Took a position at $15. Placebo effect is way overblown, mineral oil may prevent absorption of certain small amount of nutrients at this dosage but does not itself get metabolized. Also it is quite normal for triglycerides to go up a group of older patients over a 5-year span.
1690 2018-11-13 21:33:42 I think that the operations CEO stated on LBC that their own products do not contain Palm Oil.
1691 2018-11-13 21:33:40 your taxes pay for AK already. 2 military bases + transpo/healthcare/education. AK is dependent on fed dollars yet it's nearly 40 yrs since we paid a state income tax. meanwhile, the gov-elect campaigned on increasing every Alaskan's oil weath fund check to nearly $7K next yr.
1692 2018-11-13 21:33:40 What this means is that between 2010 and 2015, a peril of 5yrs, the PDP FG increased our debt profile $28B. And this is a period we had oil boom selling as high as over $100.Before that, Nigeria's debt as inherited by the PDP in 1999 is $17B.
1693 2018-11-13 21:33:27 I don’t buy anything with palm oil in. Turns up in the most surprising products. Tunnocks tea cakes being the most depressing so far x
1694 2018-11-13 21:33:20 Evidently she did have a discussion with Pelosi because Pelosi made an announcement saying she is considering reinstating the climate committee and AOC thanked her! My grandma said the squeaky wheel gets the oil! Good for her!
1695 2018-11-13 21:33:16 Britain was on its arse literally 45 years ago ...no jobs no hope no bloody petrol then the common market was established to ease all of Europe’s woes which all agreed was for the good of countries then boom North Sea oil happened then twits like your peers decided sod the lot!

1701 2018-11-13 21:32:24 Sorry Piers, but the UK today is a very different beast to even 40 years ago. The two main tax revenues for HM Government are from Financial Services (leaving the UK) and Oil and Gas (diminishing). These have kept successive governments in funds since Mrs T. What is there left?

1703 2018-11-13 21:32:13 @10DowningStreet Now that the cost of a barrel of oil is at its lowest since 2015, when will the consumers see a dramatic drop on prices at the pump. We are being ripped off totally #motoristkeepthecountrymoving #whataboutus
1704 2018-11-13 21:32:08 Yeah $0 oil it is 
1705 2018-11-13 21:32:07 The problem is, Saudi Arabia doesn't produce all the world's oil anymore. So now where is the United States peg?  How do we compete against the Country whom we've pegged our dollar or too without repercussions.  US Banks heavily invested in US oil are bleeding because of this.

With technology & discovery why does it HAVE to be just palm oil?
1710 2018-11-13 21:31:33 I suspect that was more to do with NATO which should have disbanded after USSR collapsed. Instead it has carried on the cold war for financial gain. But by threatening Russia via Ukraine NATO is creating the world war it was set up to prevent. Paradox of US oil/dollar matrix.

1732 2018-11-13 21:29:51 I want to. I need skin help! My skin is really oily it’s like oil is trapped in and tiny bumps form bc of it it’s so annoying 
1733 2018-11-13 21:29:20 Spreading some natural hair knowledge on y’all TL: oil and water doesn’t mix... how could oil moisturize hair when it repels water? Water is the source of moisture. Oil seals in that moisture but does not let moisture in. 
1734 2018-11-13 21:29:07 You need to change it to blockchain oil then.
1735 2018-11-13 21:28:45 OOh they were sooo good! Cheese was a mix of soy milk, nutritional yeast, oil, garlic powder, marmite, salt, and tapioca starch to thicken and give a melty texture. When we've nailed the exact recipe we'll share it :)
1736 2018-11-13 21:28:25 Natty about to get destroyed. Final add today for me. We are seeing/have seen fund liquidation on OIL and NATTY. This pair trade blew up for someone. Thats why they have been tick for tick inverse.

1738 2018-11-13 21:28:23 Being a biscuit lover and having to avoid the work biscuit jar because I’m cutting out palm oil is probably my biggest daily challenge

1740 2018-11-13 21:28:20 ILS Y  VONT TROP FORT! les taxes sur le gas oil étaient à  augmenter mais pas à un rythme pareil et en préparant des alternatives : prendre 5 à 6 ans pour équiper les véhicules à rouler au gaz, au GPL...comme la ville de Calcuta l'a fait!
1741 2018-11-13 21:28:18 welp oil getting oversold, and for when the waters calm down 60-70 range should be normality, outside pumps and dumps
1742 2018-11-13 21:28:13 The inteligent answer is a united states of Europa does not want to be coerced by a US denominated NATO as the oil/dollar matrix that gives Yanks hegemony of planet will soon be ending. USSR wanted NATO disbanded but it bluffed & now threatend Russia.

1748 2018-11-13 21:27:59 I use used motor oil for fire starting. It's a little harder to start but it tends to burn longer than gasoline and no flash backs. 
Your Welcome. 
1749 2018-11-13 21:27:38 Enjoyed reading your book @kaminmohammadi #bellafigura in August, use virgin olive oil, walk more, focus on fun things - feel good and have lost 10lb!!! So yes please message me details of your branded virgin olive oil

1751 2018-11-13 21:27:31 @NestleUSA thank you for not using palm oil in your @Nestle product bunch a crunch.
1752 2018-11-13 21:27:28  why tf do you have colours and oil pastels ??
1753 2018-11-13 21:27:26 Pelosi gobbles up the big oil and gas money... Again she lies.
1754 2018-11-13 21:27:16 Before 2020, watch for Trump to possibly attack Venezuela, possibly team up with Brazil's dictator. It would be a prime target for him since he's already been discussing it. What's also in Venezuela? Oil. Lot's of Oil.
1755 2018-11-13 21:27:09 I couldn’t care how he talked, as a “white folk”, I thought he and his policies were the worst thing that ever happened to our country.  And I couldn’t care less how well he spoke.  Most snake oil salesmen, of every race, speak well.
1756 2018-11-13 21:27:08 Oil collapsed 8%.

Nobody talks about Vitol, Gunvor, Glencore, Trafigura, Mercuria etc.
1757 2018-11-13 21:27:04 Think we all will need extra warm nightwear come next winter - looks like oil supplies will be cut (at last)...  Hope your sales play along with #StopFundingHate strength!
1758 2018-11-13 21:26:54 Indeed. So in reality only around quarter of their output is currently being affected by the current oil bear market. Not bad going.
1759 2018-11-13 21:26:54 All the ingredients are divided up and portioned out. There’s some prepping and various things you need that aren’t included (olive oil, salt/pepper, sugar, things you usually have in the kitchen), but the rest is right there and ready for you. It’s so nice!
1760 2018-11-13 21:26:51 “I hope your oil leaks, you nasty hoe”
1761 2018-11-13 21:26:49 I started roasting cauliflower amd broccoli recently and i dont think I could go back to doing it any other way. Just throwing loads of paprika and garlic and stuff over everything then chucking oil on it and just loving life

1766 2018-11-13 21:26:25 Liberals demand Leftists "be reasonable" on a bunch of things, but its not "reasonable" that Big Oil knew about climate change & denied it for decades to boost profits. Its not "reasonable" that the poor & POC will suffer most of CC's impacts while the rich sit high and dry.
1767 2018-11-13 21:26:23 Correct. Forget oil in #CNY it won't happen til they behave themselves or depeg
1768 2018-11-13 21:26:20 Whatever MBS does, america will always be on the side of Saudi Arabia as long as the oil keeps flowing and dollars keep coming in.

Let no one tell you any thing different from that
1769 2018-11-13 21:26:19 So is 100/barrel still a thing?? #OIL ......asking for a friend.... and I needed this after the baptizing I’m taking in this historical #natgas move

1771 2018-11-13 21:26:13 It is easy for clownshoes like BoJo and Mogg to grandstand from the side.

They shod be called out on their own detailed plans as an alternative.

But they would rather snipe and sell snake oil with meaningless "land of milk and honey" garbage.

1772 2018-11-13 21:26:06 @ClaudiaWinkle please stop promoting Head & Shoulders shampoo which is uses palm oil in its products and is leading to the destruction of rain forests in the Far East. Sadly, habitat loss is resulting in the death of Orang Utangs who are struggling. PLEASE HELP!
1773 2018-11-13 21:26:04 Some lady just trashed my company on Facebook because we put in the oil that she requested which was basic oil over the dexos specification that we warned her would void her warranty. Her mechanic told her we put in the wrong oil. God bless the ignorant

1775 2018-11-13 21:25:50 Do FG was only able to save $1B from over $380B which is it's share from oil receipts from  2010 to 2015...is that not shameful
1776 2018-11-13 21:25:33 Steven Universe: hey were the crystal gems just fending off worldly threats, dont mind us :)

1777 2018-11-13 21:25:25 I will not eat at a certain local pizza shop because when my son was looking for a job, they told him they don't hire guys. 

WHO THE HELL IS IN THE KITCHEN AND THE DISHROOM THO??

Tbh, it's not hard to boycott them. Everything they make is SOAKED in oil.
1778 2018-11-13 21:25:20 I know right. It's like there's a bunch of people more worried about how many fish fingers Iceland sell as a result of their dastardly plan THAT MADE PALM OIL THE MOST DISCUSSED THING IN DA INTERNETS. 
1779 2018-11-13 21:25:09 Tankers from Churchill to NB for Canadian consumption no problem. Or direct to Great Britain even shorter. Buy Canadian oil not milk.
1780 2018-11-13 21:25:08 Plastic, palm oil, population growth, climate change, nuclear weapons.
1781 2018-11-13 21:25:06 hmmmm but where is oil?
1782 2018-11-13 21:25:02 So I was looking at the Baltic Dry Index today (yeah I'm fun), my favorite leading indicator for the global economy.  The BDI is signaling a real slowdown in global activity, which is consistent with, among other things, plummeting global oil prices.#allbymyself

1786 2018-11-13 21:24:19 Oh great. Now the fish in my aquarium need cbd oil apparently.
1787 2018-11-13 21:24:18 so oil is going to $50,000 too?
1788 2018-11-13 21:24:13 So there’s been like what, 3 or 4 incidents with oil or gas lines/fields in Colorado since prop 112 failed amid a bunch of controversy? Fires, suspicious packages leading to a town evacuation.

Not to be captain obvious here but... You’re reading between the lines I’d hope, yes?

1794 2018-11-13 21:23:28 And just a mere few weeks ago the talk was a new era of a secular bull for oil. I guess the secular bear is back on after today.
1795 2018-11-13 21:23:21 Oil and gas are not going anywhere for a good while, and alternatives still rely on precious materials that we are reliant on trade for.
1796 2018-11-13 21:23:18 Food inflation, actually lack thereof,  seems to be the saviour during the NBFC borrowing crisis. With oil receding, perhaps we can actually cushion the drop in consumer demand. Consumer EMI and exuberant sales may just be back sooner rather than later.
1797 2018-11-13 21:23:16 The major decline was after the Oil Price Shock. We lost 30% of the fleet because they couldn't catch enough fish to pay for the fuel, the crews or run the boats its another nothing argument. Fishing is worth less than 0.05% of GDP its not an econmic argument just an emotional 1

1805 2018-11-13 21:22:11 World stocks mixed: Europe +.7%; US -.2%. Early day US rally short-circuited by sharp drop in oil. Currently, no catalyst for rally. Expect US-China talks to produce an agreement that Trump can claim as victory but won't change much. Still, will be enough to spur solid rally.

1819 2018-11-13 21:20:40 It all applies to Canada as our auto sector is part of the companies that continue to cheat emissions tests. Canada provides generous oil subsidies to its own industry while cancelling hydrogen funding in places like BC. Trudeau even used taxpayer dollars to buy Trans Mountain.

So plenty of downside ahead but not in a straight line. Will allow Fed to ease up on brakes. S&P to 3300+.

1862 2018-11-13 21:17:22 It’s just another market to me, can’t go back to ISDX as NEX has evolved massively since then. Like an emerging sector be it oil at 26 or any the NEX under the founder of a Numis has a chance and as it costs companies £13k a year to list the corp costs of aim seem expensive
1863 2018-11-13 21:17:20 I’m about to be *that* white person, but I swear by my essential oil diffuser. You can make it smell like anything (my faves are a mix of peppermint and eucalyptus, or orange and grapefruit) and also get aromatherapy benefits.
1864 2018-11-13 21:17:16 Your body TYPICALLY only can absorb 180mg of vitamin C a day (you might be different). I suggest, if you want to fight off colds, you look into apple cider vinegar tablets or liquid, coconut oil capsules and this really good South African tincture called umcka! 
1865 2018-11-13 21:17:15 Urgent vote to transform the #palmoil industry! RT to tell palm oil body @RSPOtweets to become credible & adopt ‘No #Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ policies in its new rules - and enforce them against @Indofood too!  #RT16 #RSPO
1866 2018-11-13 21:17:07 Omg its the new ice age first one since the fake one in the 1970s all to be followed up with the new global warming to follow that fake profesy of the 1990s all created to make liberals rich snake oil salesmen the con of two millennium . liberals buy that shit every time ha ha
1867 2018-11-13 21:17:05 This lil oil pen was a great investment
1868 2018-11-13 21:17:00 vitamin E oil the only one that works for me lol
1869 2018-11-13 21:16:59 The federal government of Nigeria really think the Niger Deltans are pretty daft. They drill oil from our backyards and bring makeup artists to us for skill acquisition.  And they term this empowerment. 

What a nation!
1870 2018-11-13 21:16:58 @975krock weird question... I heard an advertisement while listening the other day for a place offering oil change, tire change and an 89(?) point inspection for $89. Can you tell me who that was for? Thanks
1871 2018-11-13 21:16:54 Hola, 2 preguntas... que tipo de arroz  ( alborio o nano) y Trufas usastes ( Truffle oil) o Trufas ? Saludos !

1873 2018-11-13 21:16:46 Wrt palm oil prices, is M'sia the sole or dominant source of the commodity? Do buyers have other choices for suppliers? Buyers source for the best deals. China has no special commitment to buy M'sian palm oil. As does any other buyer.. @guanenglim
1874 2018-11-13 21:16:24 Dec US crude oil options expiry tomorrow so the cow is getting milked every drop. Might buy some 56 Jan calls tomorrow.
1875 2018-11-13 21:16:18 There are a lot of desperate people looking for quick and easy solutions and a fast buck. He's the industry equivalent of a snake oil salesman.

1877 2018-11-13 21:16:12 @newroblox1011 I’m unhappy played fishing colony tycoon for several hours had all the fish catchers and first 2 oil Riggs. Could not find a way to save my game and lost all progress
1878 2018-11-13 21:16:08 A Consultant friend shared a theory on why forest fires are becoming so hard to put out. Electro magnetic fields have damage plant life and adapting to protect themselves by increasing their natural oils via terpenes. The higher oil content means fires burn harder for longer 
1879 2018-11-13 21:16:08 Wht exactly r we marketin/demarketin, d oil or d people? D world nos d value of r oil n d harworking Nigerians abroad.

1880 2018-11-13 21:16:07 I never feel quite as millennial as when my cooking overlaps with my beauty routine. 
Coconut oil? Great for an oil cleanse AND in chocolate avocado cupcakes!
Cider vinegar? Use it to mix my facemask AND to add a touch of sour to my soup.

1882 2018-11-13 21:16:00 You set up a spoof account ?
That is genuis.
Idiots who followed it...that is sheer class Adrian,
1883 2018-11-13 21:15:49 Even more unpopular opinion: 
If the countries who benefit from the production of palm oil will be boycotted - will they not move on to a different type of crop instead (such as date palms) that will affect orangutans and deforestation just as much as palm oil production?
1884 2018-11-13 21:15:44 Swisse Olive Leaf cleanser 2x daily, Swisse Echinacea moisturizer in the morning, and Palmers Facial Perfecting Oil at night 
1885 2018-11-13 21:15:44 Garlic is underrated. Few food items can taste so many distinct ways, handled correctly. Misuse of garlic is a crime. If you want to cook garlic peel fresh, don't spew it rotting in oil in screwtop jars. #cookingtips
1886 2018-11-13 21:15:30 Very well written, except Oil States doesn't require an apostrophe.
Must do better. B-.
1887 2018-11-13 21:15:30 We have different kinds of skin ooo maybe try adiagbon or Bette still coconut oil only
1888 2018-11-13 21:15:28 Got to be close to capitulation for Oil stocks
1889 2018-11-13 21:15:23 $20 drop in Crude Oil prices in 5 weeks. The froth has truly gone. #crudeoil
1890 2018-11-13 21:15:18 Palm oil, hunting, plastic, population growth, health issues,
1891 2018-11-13 21:15:16 Falz
1892 2018-11-13 21:15:16 China's the biggest customer of Saudi oil. You won't see anything like a riot from Islamists regarding the persecution of Muslims in China ever.
1893 2018-11-13 21:15:12 Fish oil burps are the WORST
1894 2018-11-13 21:15:08 Another volatile day: Stocks surrender early rally to close mostly lower. Dow -100, -0.4% to 25,286. S&P -0.2%, while Nasdaq ends nearly unchanged.

Losers edge winners 16 to 15 on NYSE + Nasdaq

Energy stocks plunge as oil collapses amid rising supplies. US crude -8% to $55.16
1895 2018-11-13 21:15:06 قبل اقل من ساعه انظر ماذا قال رئيس أمريكا عن مركز الثقل العربي السعودية Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!
1896 2018-11-13 21:15:02 It is good seeing a oil company looking into environmentally friendly alternative fuels.
1897 2018-11-13 21:14:52 oil and china making me feel really uneasy
1898 2018-11-13 21:14:43 Oil will soon be traded in Crypto - and the mighty fiat dollar will fall.
1899 2018-11-13 21:14:36 Apparently it's not so bad. They used a small chamber with a cover and reflector. You open it, put the lantern in, and it keeps it directed in front of you at all times like a headlight. Hands free solution. Also, medieval oil lamps did spill much less than our cheap modern ones.
1900 2018-11-13 21:14:31 Had a Beyond Meat burger for dinner tonight. Surprisingly close to beef, although the texture was a bit mushy. 
Main thing was the excessive salt. 
That and the coconut oil makes it one super unhealthy burger.
1901 2018-11-13 21:14:30 And where does the hydrogen come from? In case people don’t know it is so light that escapes the atmosphere. So, probably from oil reserves as well, from dehydrogenating the crude oil... same problem. #notsocleanenergy
1902 2018-11-13 21:14:19 Potushas lost itl He said ready play chicken with Saudi Arabia+Russia. US  oil is composed of investors money. In the meantime it is a total slaughter of small investors.They are loosing thoushands $$  some loosing everything, Potus playing chicken with people s money is sadism
1903 2018-11-13 21:14:18 I am getting there. Somehow with all my stress I haven’t felt as bad! I started taking CBD oil. Could it actually be working?!!! 
1904 2018-11-13 21:14:12 Only use Maris Pipers, boil for 20 minutes, give a good shake to ruffle the edges, allow to cool then roast for an hour in a 50/50 goosefat and sunflower oil mix. Throw in a garlic glove and rosemary in last 10 mins of roasting.
1905 2018-11-13 21:14:04 Dow extends decline to a 3rd session in a row as oil prices log worst day since 2015
1906 2018-11-13 21:14:03 Decades of the Democrats doing jack shit without pressure says that. A committee won’t do anything at all unless people have eyes on it, especially if the committee is filled with people bought by the oil industry. Like Nancy. Empty gestures won’t cut it anymore.
1907 2018-11-13 21:14:02 $55 is a good level for #oil #wti
1908 2018-11-13 21:13:56 Deberían de empezar a pagar en no mucho tiempo estas compras,el oil va destrozado
1909 2018-11-13 21:13:43 that's a good point. there seems to be a tension between the "hey gov'ts need to do much more to get below 2C" and "hey gov'ts need to invest much more in oil capacity to avoid price spikes in the 2020s"
1910 2018-11-13 21:13:37 THANK GOD FOR OIL WE DON'T NEED ANY OTHER KIND OF RENEWABLE RESOURCES
1911 2018-11-13 21:13:35 Aye... done the same.... with old air rifle found burnt on a bonfire. Was fun until we decided to strip it down, clean and oil. After that it drew blood! #foolishnessofyouth
1912 2018-11-13 21:13:26 i think OPEC used to try to prop up obama with low oil prices. not sure why putin alowed it.
1913 2018-11-13 21:13:23 DO NOT CONSUME PALM OIL PRODUCTS!!! BITCH
1914 2018-11-13 21:13:21 For me I go pour that red oil for that my neighbor body
I dey hail una for the work wey una do
#mbadastation
1915 2018-11-13 21:13:17 A cluttered Heart is like a Glass of drinking water with Oil in it. It becomes difficult for the oxygen to be available. Let it Go
1916 2018-11-13 21:13:16 I mean it's a good starting point for many.. whether you consume animal products or not, no point continuing to be an advocate of palm oil either 
1917 2018-11-13 21:13:16 Gold down, copper down,  lumber down,  crude oil down. Most commodities are down. Will the FED need to do 3 rate hikes in 2019. Almost seems madness given how the US is embroiled in a global trade war with everyone.
1918 2018-11-13 21:13:09 It's really difficult to find products that don't contain palm oil. I'm trying to only buy products that contain sustainably produced palm oil.
1919 2018-11-13 21:13:07 things to use: 
-castor oil 
-coconut oil
-olive oil 
use on a brush, brush up and down to coat all the hairs fully, then sleep with it overnight:)
1920 2018-11-13 21:12:56 Plenty of petitions to sign against it too; and lots of companies whose relationship with palm oil producers is contributing to the loss of habitat. Time to take a stand
1921 2018-11-13 21:12:54 #es_f gave us a couple 20-25 points trades today. Outside of that it was thin, choppy and noisy. Today’s low isn’t a bad low. Not a very good low. But within 2 points of 2712. Is that close enough? Then a close in the middle of no mans land. All about oil. Everything debt bomb?
1922 2018-11-13 21:12:51 Yuck... They can have it all.. Refined coconut oil? Wow they’ve removed the best part of it: Lauric Acid .. No Processed, Prepacked or Preserved junks in my house.. It’s all fresh, whole food or nothing..
1923 2018-11-13 21:12:48  biased? Look at the organizations you're quoting. The AHA?! Yes, you're right they are the last hold out for still thinking saturated fat causes CHO but I'm sure they are enjoying checks they get from the vegetable oil industry.
1924 2018-11-13 21:12:42 So let me get this straight, the US Treasury designated the Secretary-General of Imam Ali Battalions as a Terrorist for sending fighters into Syria and smuggling oil to Iran on top of raising money for Hezbollah?

lol
1925 2018-11-13 21:12:41 its temporary for now....oil prices would have to sustain low levels for 6-9 months before it started to affect them
1926 2018-11-13 21:12:40 Ooh and this oil from Sephora. It makes me glow. 
1927 2018-11-13 21:12:40 Oh nah b lol you better learn how to do your own oil changes. It ain’t hard lol
1928 2018-11-13 21:12:33 1/

Couple of comments.

1st.) This market is very hard for all involved. Do not get discouraged or change methodology. Disruptions are a part of it

2nd.) Most are losing..whether is is long only, oil, #volatility, any asset class...it is tough for everyone.
1929 2018-11-13 21:12:31 James you have no fucking clue, so please stfu.  I work in the wine industry.  It costs twice as much to ship wine from CA to east coast as it does from France.  Why,  because your buddy Trump has done Jack shit to improve transportation costs and fed the oil companies billions
1930 2018-11-13 21:12:31 Does this mean a big reduction on reliance on oil? Would be so nice!
1931 2018-11-13 21:12:31 Oh dear! I have PTSD as well and dreams are weird and terrifying. Got chased by a hand towel once! And just before the midterms I dreamed M Obama was comforting me by stroking my hand and she turned into tRump!Worst dream ever! I ran out of CBD oil a month ago.
1932 2018-11-13 21:12:29 Keep it to the oil
1933 2018-11-13 21:12:25 I overpaid for an oil change & I’m sad now LOL
1934 2018-11-13 21:12:23 I went out for an oil change today and somehow ended up leaving the mall with a 100 dollars worth of stuff I don't need. 
1935 2018-11-13 21:12:22 The worst thing with the IEA report is that it urges governments and investors to invest into more oil&gas capacity in order to avoid higher prices. With other words they like to see the planet being faster destroy, making it inhabitable.
1936 2018-11-13 21:12:19 Thank you Connie Amati Haney for this lava bead diffuser bracelet! Using with Spearmint essential oil to curb cravings & 'cause it smells like gum

1937 2018-11-13 21:12:16 Until we find oil under them.
1938 2018-11-13 21:12:12 $100 oil mania 6 weeks ago was a good clue also Jesse
1939 2018-11-13 21:12:07 The lesson here is to never let firemen deep fry a turkey. They always overfill the pot with oil then drop a frozen or very wet turkey into the oil. Have used one of these for going on 15 yrs with never a problem. Read directions & use some common sense, something firemen don’t
1940 2018-11-13 21:11:52 My gf suggested that we cut palm oil out of our diets as to help reduce our footprint on the rainforests. No vegan butter alternative is palm oil free so we’re going to start making our own.
1941 2018-11-13 21:11:45 Mazola or fully synthetic motor oil?
1942 2018-11-13 21:11:43 $AAPL why apple always crash with oil?
1943 2018-11-13 21:11:42 My great-grandfather refused to buy Plymouth cars because his stopped running, for reasons he could never pinpoint. He warned people off them for years. (The reason was actually that my grandfather ruined the engine running it without oil. He never confessed.)
1944 2018-11-13 21:11:40 Crude oil down to $55..."sure it's good for the consumer, but THIS is the STOCKMARKET!  This is PAIN! "  Heard on @CNBC 
1945 2018-11-13 21:11:39 oil shows you why its impossible to try to trade rallies in bear markets i saw bears calling for a bounce in oil all week then it tanks 7 percent in a day
1946 2018-11-13 21:11:38 The snake oil salesman also told me I could trust him...
1947 2018-11-13 21:11:37 Now that the Saudis have neutered themselves (see Kashoggi) and the Iranian sanctions are 'relaxed' oil prices will stabilise and the stock market will be the focus of hostilities.
It will get erratic....
#TheWarOnTrump #WWG1WGA
1948 2018-11-13 21:11:33 I got groupon for a oil change and alignment. Who needs it? Letting it go for cheap
1949 2018-11-13 21:11:22 You know how to change your oil? But not change your tire?? 
1950 2018-11-13 21:11:20 Glad this batch exposed, they should go to prison.  Must note that the idea of these programs having been shut down for gaps of time then restarted is inaccurate, they merely changed the names and locations of them until caught again, like snake oil salesman, or Catholic priests
1951 2018-11-13 21:11:16 They can't risk losing their oil money.
1952 2018-11-13 21:11:02 The U.S. commit $80 Billion alone to prevent the auto industry from going under. GM, Chrysler and their subsidiary car brands would not exist without the bailouts. Obama not only bailed out the corrupt institutions, he cancelled hydrogen car funding in favour of oil subsidies.
1953 2018-11-13 21:10:45 News flash: gas already costs $240 per gallon if you consider that one half of federal taxes go to the DoD and one of half of the DoD is for protecting the oil trade.
1954 2018-11-13 21:10:44 My engine light just came on? I just took it for an oil change yesterday ? I hope the dude’s didnt mess up my car because they think I know nothing about it?? Which i don’t but still??? help idek what to do lol
1955 2018-11-13 21:10:40 Couldn't agree more. It is ad that was meant to be banned.  Iceland is the 1st and as far as I know the only supermarket that removed palm oil from its own brand products, and they target the "green" people market
1956 2018-11-13 21:10:36 Eucalyptus and peppermint! I feel like I’m dealing with my sinuses 24/7 lmao but it helps to boil some water add a couple drops of either oil and breathe the steam in! Or you can mix it in with some Vaseline and make your own Vick’s vapor rub for the T zone
1957 2018-11-13 21:10:31 Wishing & Hoping won’t solve the Hypocrisy of Eastern Canada buying Tanker Oil from Saudi’s killer Sheik’s & Venezuelan killer dictators & USA while Ont & Que stop a  oil pipeline. Ont & Que want the west to buy their Dairy products while they use foreign oil. Check all Labels
1958 2018-11-13 21:10:30 we encourage you to check again. 14 varieties of flower, 6 varieties of crumble and 4 oil products in stock currently.
1959 2018-11-13 21:10:30 Donald Trump has played a hell of a chess move in bringing oil prices down. However, I fear the worst for Nigeria. Less Petrodollars imminent.
1960 2018-11-13 21:10:24 He wouldn't even break this when our cat fell into a vat of used oil (it came with the house??) and the vet specifically recommended Dawn because of its usage in cleaning up oil spills!
1961 2018-11-13 21:10:23 When the decline is due to irrational pricing rather than fundamental, you don't need snake oil, mineral oil or dreams, just need return of rational pricing mechanism.
1962 2018-11-13 21:10:22 Well fancy that, I'll go to sea (quaint southern expression of surprise)........and the remainers probably think this is a great idea, yeah really fun times so we can all get together and bomb the shit out of more innocent countries with oil. Not for me, sick of this elitism. 
1963 2018-11-13 21:10:22 This is nonsense.
  The bulk of the oil and gas industry operating in Canada is not controlled by Canadians!  #cdnpoli
1964 2018-11-13 21:10:03 全ての油という油に感謝しているよ。
1965 2018-11-13 21:09:46 And really great music!  Closer enough to Chicago or Toronto, too.

Water is the new oil.
1966 2018-11-13 21:09:35 @LidlUK Any plans for a Chinese week anytime soon? My Dad's running low on Vitasia Wok Oil :-O
1967 2018-11-13 21:09:34 But I thought PCO ate nuts and bolts and drank oil?
1968 2018-11-13 21:09:23 Absolutely stuffed after my delicious dinner of Orangutan fried in a little fried oil.
1969 2018-11-13 21:09:20 IF You ban menthols ... I will just put my regular cigarette  into Mint "essential" oil.
1970 2018-11-13 21:09:17  na you put oil there?
1971 2018-11-13 21:09:15 fine.
1972 2018-11-13 21:09:09 There is one party just taking refuge in the plight of #oil bulls and that's the CCP

#China
1973 2018-11-13 21:09:05 I know quotas are legal in the province of Alberta, but I don’t know if it’s the case in the US. Anyhow I can’t say that I agree with quota, id rather have US oil displacing oil from other countries (except Canada) rather than limiting their own production.
1974 2018-11-13 21:09:03 The bastards! That's it. I'm buying some fucking palm oil.
1975 2018-11-13 21:09:02 Miners had a rough day. Must be mining for oil instead of gold.
1976 2018-11-13 21:08:56 Oh, I think some fund have been puking their books for days. Not just oil.
1977 2018-11-13 21:08:55 Да уж согласен свэй ли лох
1978 2018-11-13 21:08:49 Great news we still are owned by the saud's and the oil companies are giving us toxic air, water, big thanks.
1979 2018-11-13 21:08:48 Scientists have for years warned that certain fracking chemicals are hormone disruptors: In 2016, a large review of 45 studies on oil & gas chemicals concluded, there is ample evidence for disruption of the estrogen, androgen, and progesterone receptors by oil and gas chemicals.
1980 2018-11-13 21:08:47 na there all d oil de 
1981 2018-11-13 21:08:46 Yes @TomOsborneMHA went “CHICKEN COUNTING” Brent oil down - $17.14 per bbl (-19.35%) for the last month.  the @nlliberals are losing there cash cow for promises in the 2019 elections #nlpoli
1982 2018-11-13 21:08:46 I believe in conspiracy theories, just not ones that originate from 1920's Nazi propaganda. Most American Jews are not Zionists, and Israel only exists because it's a military asset. The imperialists control what to do with israel to assert dominance over oil, not the "Jew elite"
1983 2018-11-13 21:08:42 i never used oil paint and idek where to start
1984 2018-11-13 21:08:37 Started long swing positions in several oil companies in my TFSA.  4-6 month holds are planned.
1985 2018-11-13 21:08:37 there is essential oil bergamot... I feel like something must exist. 
1986 2018-11-13 21:08:35 About the only thing I feel comfortable buying. $VET $CVE and $SU. The rest of them are too susceptible to the volatility/market conditions right now. Will hold, but not ready to add to anything else other than those 3 as far as oil producers go.
1987 2018-11-13 21:08:34 is it any oil stands at pg ???
1988 2018-11-13 21:08:31 Put on oil AND lotion today but my legs still dryyyyyyyyyyy
1989 2018-11-13 21:08:21 Hks great call on oil. How low do you think we get on this cycle? Thanks
1990 2018-11-13 21:08:12 More like they'll need to bomb Iran directly to fix this trend.

@chigrl is there a metric on the US available output without any new wells? Do we now have to wait for a bunch of wildcatters to go bankrupt for oil to turn now or is all this just temporary and technical?
1991 2018-11-13 21:08:04 Thanks Tom and I hope I can sell oil to Arabs lol x
1992 2018-11-13 21:08:03 MaZimbabweans like inotoita kunge Zim Gold cooking oil 2ritaz
1993 2018-11-13 21:08:01 what did i do to deserve olive oil
1994 2018-11-13 21:07:59 Use rapeseed oil instead of bacon fat it’s not good for you ma’am
1995 2018-11-13 21:07:55 There's the fish oil pills i used to take. Forgot the name, but when i had trouble focusing used those. Way more safe.
1996 2018-11-13 21:07:53 #MarketWrap Major indexes close mixed, flat. DOW -0.40%, S&P 500 -0.15%, NASDAQ +0.00%.

Oil hammering the energy sector with US Brent falling into bear market after falling for a record 11 sessions in a row.
1997 2018-11-13 21:07:44 Are you taking CBD Oil and C60?  Dustin Nemo’s and Jordan Strather can steer you in the right direction and help you with additional supplements. Pain killers are THE WORST!
1998 2018-11-13 21:07:44 People are shocked from hedge funds unwinding oil longs.. wait until they do it with the dollar.. its going to be much, much worse. #oott
1999 2018-11-13 21:07:38 Anything with palm oil in it!
2000 2018-11-13 21:07:36 Unfortunately, France was not been militarily crucial for any battle in WWII or any other military conflict thereafter, with the exception for the Sarkozy-led destruction of Libya as a viable state and the reintroduction of slavery. Well done  At least they ‘took the oil’ 
2001 2018-11-13 21:07:32 Correct babe, Oil is in your head
2002 2018-11-13 21:07:29 @CNBCClosingBell @WilfredFrost @MorganLBrennan The US #oil industry @US_OGA is getting kill by its own greed &.......#Trump.  #wti #brent
2003 2018-11-13 21:07:28 Que producto del espejismo del spare capacity de los Saudis... se abre una ventana de oportunidad para ir contra los Chavistas y los ayatollah en Iran. Y vamos a terminar con el Oil a +$150 ... porque ese spare capacity no existe y las inversiones se estan paralizando una vez mas
2004 2018-11-13 21:07:24 When I was a teenager I thought it would be a great idea to lay in the sun on tin foil and use cooking oil as suntan oil. I feel asleep. Exactly where my dark spots are now is where the blisters formed from that burn. I know it’s painful!
2005 2018-11-13 21:07:19 As I once said to you, that you could sell oil to the Arabs, we as a group here need to help you in whatever way we can. to help you get your adventure known far and wide.

2007 2018-11-13 21:07:16 Erm...is it just me, or does an integrated oil lamp seem like a profoundly bad idea? #iTeachEngineering, but I would think anybody might think twice...
2008 2018-11-13 21:07:14 For sure oil has value at these levels. I went long again today just under 58 but with such a decline even someone like me who bought this afternoon is already in a bad mood.
2009 2018-11-13 21:07:13 Rachel...check back a few years ago..on either Letterman or Regis and kelly... trump said one of the 1st things he'd do as president would be to go after the oil barons as gas is in excess and we shouldn't be paying high prices  for it!
2010 2018-11-13 21:07:13 I sauteed chicken breast in toasted sesame seed oil and I think the smell of it is getting me hard
2011 2018-11-13 21:07:09 I use to think the oil and water on the pavement was ringworm. That rainbow shit

2014 2018-11-13 21:06:53 It’s now or never to save #orangutans: key #palmoil vote happening to urge global palm oil body @RSPOtweets to insist that members like @Indofood commit to ‘No #Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ #RT16 #RSPO
2015 2018-11-13 21:06:52 Just use tea tree oil and keep it clean 
2016 2018-11-13 21:06:52 You think the same gov that is too inept, leaky, inefficient, and slow to regulate health insurance, enviro protections, oil, power, education, or business also runs a deep state, new-world-order conspiracy it's kept secret from 300m people for decades? Fool. #QAnon = #QuackAnon
2017 2018-11-13 21:06:49 The recent numbers by #IEA do not make sense: world's car fleet to increase by 80% by 2040 while oil used by cars will increase by just 1.6m barrels/d when 23.6m cars burn 21.4m barrels.
2018 2018-11-13 21:06:43 A listless teenager, hampered by a head trauma, falls in with the wrong crowd that involves him in robbing North Dakota oil boom country.

2022 2018-11-13 21:06:28 time to buy crude oil.  way over-sold!
2023 2018-11-13 21:06:26 We finally have a chance to transform the destructive #palmoil industry from within. Tell global palm oil body @RSPOtweets to vote to stop certifying companies like @Indofood that exploit people and land for cheap palm oil in its NEW principles #RSPO #RT16
2024 2018-11-13 21:06:22 OIL price plunged another 8.2% today!!

2026 2018-11-13 21:06:09 Wasnt aware of that battle, but crete had great value if the British kept it they could destabilize the whole Mediterranean using it as an aircraft carrier and bomb the German's oil fields. It had to be taken or else there would be big problems for sure. Glad you liked the video!
2027 2018-11-13 21:06:07 me n mum are super set on cutting out palm oil as best we can so are currently on ft going through all food/cleaning products etc so we know what not to buy 
2028 2018-11-13 21:06:06 *rubs oil on your forehead*
2029 2018-11-13 21:06:00 You should all watch the latest episode from @patriotact! It has a good take on #ClimateChange and the oil industry
2030 2018-11-13 21:05:54 They do it for oil & money. Now they received money from Qatar so peace agreement signed again. They are hurting their own people by feeding their own egos & hatred. If they put down their weapons, there would be peace. Mark my word. They will not.
2031 2018-11-13 21:05:54 "The settlement acknowledges that Seaboard denies each and every allegation of wrongdoing and explicitly reflects that the settlement is not an admission of liability by Seaboard."

So why pay. Company position is they are being extorted, which is illegal?
2032 2018-11-13 21:05:47 Frfr castor oil has made my eyelashes grow like crazy
2033 2018-11-13 21:05:42 @WilfredFrost Mr. Frost. Lower oil is only a positive for every company every consumer all of the United States. Anyone who says differently is wrong. The market is wrong. When everyone is so negative this is when you buy stocks. It’s over done on nothing
2034 2018-11-13 21:05:40 i want someone to rub oil on my back
2035 2018-11-13 21:05:38 Congratulations to Katie Mackay Sinclair @MotherAdvertising agency for allowing Iceland(who have removed all Palm oil products)to reuse the Greenpeace film on deforestation & the plight of Orangutans,55 million have now viewed it.Power to the people.

2043 2018-11-13 21:04:56 Obfuscation obviously 
@NBCNews
2044 2018-11-13 21:04:52 This is what #Brexit is.  The people of the UK conned into national self harm by snake oil salesmen and lying, cheating xenophobes. And still they bluster that they could do better. It was NEVER going to be better.
2045 2018-11-13 21:04:50 So crude oil slump steepens 
2046 2018-11-13 21:04:49 If the crude oil crash triggers forced selling, history suggests it could easily spread into other markets.
2047 2018-11-13 21:04:46 The current price for Heating Oil is $2.499 per gallon. 
(Minimum 100 gallons)
2048 2018-11-13 21:04:33 This is called a "narrative," and is not the real reason for the decision. The real reason is economic, not political. Oilsands are not economical, thus in a world using less oil, the most expensive oil goes first.
2049 2018-11-13 21:04:29 The woman they are protesting does not believe in climate science. Receives millions from oil and pharma lobbyists and has a history of doing dick all when in a position of power. She literally talked about the "bipartisan marketplace of ideas" the DAY the Dems took the House.
2050 2018-11-13 21:04:29 .... in solidarity with don jr. I will rub some cooking oil in my hair, before retweeting all of his mindless comments.
2051 2018-11-13 21:04:23 Oil got killed today. Ugh. #Oil
2052 2018-11-13 21:04:16 A lot of CAD Forex Pairs comes to an equilibrium point of prices, that indicates a Recovery for the Canadian and Oil, Let's wait...
2053 2018-11-13 21:04:16 Locura total lo que ocurrio hoy en el Mercado del OIL. Ordenes de venta frozadas. Contratos completamente descontrolados
2054 2018-11-13 21:04:12 just like my brakes and oil change and shit , nothing too crazy but he got other cars too
2055 2018-11-13 21:04:11 Cold Swe winters up here and chapped is my middle name. All skin is different, but what's worked for me is preventative lotion before going out, honey "lip masks" once or twice a week, and an ointment I make that is mostly beeswax, olive oil and vitamin/herb oils.
2056 2018-11-13 21:04:11 Also a gift to the hundred of thousand of people whose jobs depend on high oil prices.
2057 2018-11-13 21:04:10 Fire sale on O&G names.  I guess I should be jumping into 3X bear ETFs on oil but instead I'm picking up $CFW.CA all day.  Another 1000 shares purchased.  Currently own about 12,500 shares and counting
2058 2018-11-13 21:04:08 @realDonaldTrump Pres. Trump,  how about getting the price of gas down to below $2 gal, since there price for a barrel of oil is cheaper then it was in 2003?
2059 2018-11-13 21:04:07 @realDonaldTrump is killing his own country as the leading #Oil producer in the world! What are you thinking?? The industry is just getting back on its feet and you want to knock it back down? #stupid
2060 2018-11-13 21:03:52 where is the oil?
2061 2018-11-13 21:03:50 When the oil money dries up which new team are you going to start supporting?
2062 2018-11-13 21:03:50 I fucked up myself when i did my graduation project on the oil market. My professor told me maram this is too much to do, do something little easy for your sanity. My stubborn ass who was and still is in SO IN LOVE wit the oil presisted and it could be thE most awakening ive
2063 2018-11-13 21:03:45 Save Canadian oil for another day... It's in the ground and ain't going anywhere... Just like the Canadians standing on it... Isn't that right @justintrudeau ?
2064 2018-11-13 21:03:41 Celsius, Money shift from oil to gas.
2065 2018-11-13 21:03:40 Tires changed, oil changed, and gas tank filled. I love being unemployed
2066 2018-11-13 21:03:38 75W-90 gear oil, an iron fire poker, green paint, ibuprofen, and a copy of Smash Mouth's hit album Astro Lounge

Actually nevermind to all that, let's get some beer
2067 2018-11-13 21:03:33 As per our seesaw Oil trading plan, we bought $55 today.
At $58, we stop even or sell..
We see recent selling as bullish.
We might also buy $50-52 intermediate term if offered.
Given holidays ahead, we are likely to buy only P2 or P3 support levels for most market instruments.
2068 2018-11-13 21:03:32 Boycott Cadbury's and all other Clearcast advertises that use palm oil
2069 2018-11-13 21:03:27 thousands of Republicans are in dire need of that information.

As for highest avg ever- I imagine thats true after every term, due to inflation and a reliably upwards pressure on oil prices.
2070 2018-11-13 21:03:27 Urgent vote to transform the #palmoil industry! RT to tell palm oil body @RSPOtweets to become credible & adopt ‘No #Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ policies in its new rules - and enforce them against @Indofood too!  #RT16 #RSPO
2071 2018-11-13 21:03:24 $amrn still needs fda approval...could they require a test without mineral oil, but vs a normal fish oil pull? This was just under $3 not that long ago, could go sub $10
2072 2018-11-13 21:03:24 Bizarre how Scot Tories only want Scottish waters for ScotBrit fishermen, but are fine with multi-national oil firms in the North Sea.
2073 2018-11-13 21:03:24 Ha ha just dont glug palm oil onto your porridge by accident ;-)
2074 2018-11-13 21:03:22 Well Cara, selling snake oil is a pretty lucrative business. There's no shortage of snakes, and they all need oil to slither across the ground. Plus with that Saudi oil embargo on the horizon there’s gonna be a shortage. And that’s only gonna drive up the price for Snake Gas.
2075 2018-11-13 21:03:16 Thanks. Not surprisingly US retail overall has done better with US oil and gas workers had more cash and thus a higher ppb.
2076 2018-11-13 21:03:14 My conspiracy theory for what is worth is: Either/And/Or: Diplomatic muscle flexing is occurring to Saudi Arabia regarding #khashoggi murder, and Trump wanting to sell as much US oil as possible while there is an oil market.
2077 2018-11-13 21:03:13 If the USA Admin requests assistance from OPEC+ to curb the Iran sanctions, they then increase the oil supply by 2.2 mbd but then the USA issues waivers, how can anyone manage the supply/demand equation. Acting on the sanctions before the sanctions was a BONEHEAD move! Dupped!!
2078 2018-11-13 21:03:10 Because unlike most oils/fats, it's semi-solid rather than oily/liquid at room temperature, clearly useful for making chocolate. I don't know all possible substitutes, but I know coconut oil is, but it's far far more expensive in the bulk that a company like Cadbury would need.
2079 2018-11-13 21:03:09 Raised in #EastGermany #Merkel has now made Germany dependent on Russian oil. She's moved a couple of million #MENA migrants into Europe to destabilize the continent. She hasn't paid into #NATO & now she wants a #EuropeanArmy? Those of us that know history; this sounds familiar
2080 2018-11-13 21:03:05 Foreign power backed companies were giving our dumb/useless/stupid and puppet leaders a percentage out of our oil revenue and they not only took the chicken change, they pocketed it in their personal accounts in “foreign” currencies in “foreign” countries.
2081 2018-11-13 21:03:04 Ya think? LOL Trump really did the ole bait and switch. I'm sure KSA is super happy with price of oil and the massive amounts of surplus we have floating around the globe. Ok, maybe not massive amounts..Actually fundamentals don't support price action but who cares.
2082 2018-11-13 21:03:02 Annoint him with Lion of Juda oil. He’ll wake up and the sentence.
2083 2018-11-13 21:02:49 Very disappointed to learn @cadburysilk use palm oil in their products.  No Cadbury chocolates in this house this Christmas #dispppointed #cadburysban #saveorangutan #nomorepalmoil #saveourrainforests #makeachange
2084 2018-11-13 21:02:49 Greeks do something similar adding blended onions, oil and peppers too then baking for 30 mins. Delicious.
2085 2018-11-13 21:02:47 knife catching in oil ?
2086 2018-11-13 21:02:32 Just interested - commodities move the same way as stocks? Considering oil.
2087 2018-11-13 21:02:30 When I look at the forest in totality (capital markets) instead of the trees independently (oil, rates, currencies, stocks) you know what I see?

A global (economic) war being fought along several fronts.

Throw out your playbooks until there’s a detente...
2088 2018-11-13 21:02:30 i hope this coconut oil clear these marks up on my face
2089 2018-11-13 21:02:26 After yesterday's dismal showing the S&P 500 spent most of the day today in positive territory but concerns about international growth and collapsing oil prices turned what was a 1% gain into a 4 point loss for a 4th straight day of declines.  Dow -100
2090 2018-11-13 21:02:24 Sorry, not yet the bottom. Another bottom now -7% off oil price.
2091 2018-11-13 21:02:23 So what if you spend your $40 to get a oil change & eyebrows? Are you back to square one? 
2092 2018-11-13 21:02:23 I bet you I pay 100 dollars for this damn oil change
2093 2018-11-13 21:02:21 Toxic demise as the poison seeps into the Brain’s of the less fortunate as it slowly suffocated them into a mask of great promises and life but that was all corrupted with oil of black onyx secrets .
2094 2018-11-13 21:02:17 @xkatherinegrace after your fat ass get your oil changed Are we still down for the movies???
2095 2018-11-13 21:02:02 1 day left to protect the #rainforest, #orangutans, and #palmoil workers from greedy companies like @Indofood! RT to tell @RSPOtweets, the global palm oil body, to vote to stop certifying destructive palm oil in its new Principles and Criteria #RSPO #RT16
2096 2018-11-13 21:02:01 I greatly enjoyed listening to @BilalWahab list a lot of hard truths on Iraqi+Kurdish issues of Peshmerga, Kirkuk, oil, and corruption at a time when many people don’t want to acknowledge them
2097 2018-11-13 21:01:59 These tall black boots are made to ride a motorcycle in style. The oil tan cowhide is water repellant and the custom inlaid and hand painted poppies definitely make these “ladies motorcycle boots”. initials make them much more personal. #customcowboyboots #motorcycleboots #riding
2098 2018-11-13 21:01:58 ..."it's not that easy to cut and run from the Saudis"?

...why the hell is that?  

...we have free energy tech as well as our own strategic oil reserve.

...that reserve plus what is untapped in Alaska would be more than enough for us to survive any "shock" that would result.
2099 2018-11-13 21:01:56 Been sitting at this dealership for an hour now. I know it does no take that long for oil change and tire rotation. 
2100 2018-11-13 21:01:51 Good night!  So glad I stumbled into the conversation. I came here to winge about how skewed the palm oil debate is and ended up with a smile reminiscing about Scotland.
2101 2018-11-13 21:01:50 Both sugar and salt are bad for your health but if you eat equal amounts of each they cancel each other out. As do olive oil and wine. Enjoy.
2102 2018-11-13 21:01:45 Actually the US is already exporting more than it imports. It also confuses me that trump doesn’t understand that a sustained low oil price will destroy America’s energy sector, which is already struggling to reach profitability. Hopefully Exxon lobbyists can do a better job soon
2103 2018-11-13 21:01:39 a good thing yes! but what the heck has rangtan and palm oil got to do with christmas?
2104 2018-11-13 21:01:32 salt solution and tea tree oil. they will save yo ass
2105 2018-11-13 21:01:27 Peppermint oil works good too i've heard but if you want to save some money i would go with the pills lol
2106 2018-11-13 21:01:27 Dasuki recklessly disbursed funds meant to tackle boko Haram insurgents.
GEJ came down to the Southwest to share millions of dollars in exchange for support at the polls.
Politicians and millitants were involved in brazen oil subsidy fraud draining the nation"s revenue.
2107 2018-11-13 21:01:26 No I'm not long crude oil but am long deep deep value micro-cap international E&P's most of which are unchanged today. My time frame is a little longer than tomorrow.
2108 2018-11-13 21:01:20 Big LIE. The reason our fishing industry collapsed in the 1970's was nothing to do with the EU it was the OIL Price shock disel went up 30% & because we had not invested in our fishing fleet they could not sail to sea and catch enough fish to pay for their fuel let alone the crew
2109 2018-11-13 21:01:18 Always trying to turn a kid party into a grown folks party ... If they got oil I’m there tho lol
2110 2018-11-13 21:01:16 Oil up that booty of yours then I'll say less than 5.
2111 2018-11-13 21:01:13 Soften the scales with oil, This method will help you easily and painlessly remove some of the scales, Massage oil into the scaly areas and then let it soak in, Leave it on for at least an hour, then wash it off using warm water.
2112 2018-11-13 21:01:11 Only Peter Zeihan could use a TAMU/UT rivalry to explain Persian Gulf oil dispute. So good. #Groundbreak #GBK18
2113 2018-11-13 21:00:53 抜け駆けーーーwwwwwww
2114 2018-11-13 21:00:52 i loveeeeeee conspiracy theories so her son was dating Diana then they broke up she started dating the rich oil guy i think that made the mom feel a way soooo she offed them lol mob shit
2115 2018-11-13 21:00:49 Looks cool, but the iceholes are going to see this as burning oil I.e.  doesn't portray a clean EV.
2116 2018-11-13 21:00:48 I understand that we are looking out away that said this forecast may be more realistic if the price of oil didn't go down every single day!
2117 2018-11-13 21:00:44 @elonmusk can you please tell them we no longer need oil so they can leave these people alone already
2118 2018-11-13 21:00:30 The president doesn't understand he needs to do like Putin, meet w/ OPEC and negotiate a US oil quota @samirkrey @realDonaldTrump @drfessel

Please give me money!
2122 2018-11-13 21:00:09 To my daughter it is not oil or data or rare earth metals or whatever that is the most valuable scarce resource on our planet: it is obviously Hamilton tickets in New York City...
2123 2018-11-13 21:00:06 Under the Obama administration, logging, mining, and oil drilling on public lands were drastically reduced, hurting the U.S. Forestry Service’s revenues and creating the perfect conditions for massive wildfires.
2124 2018-11-13 20:59:49 El tema es el oil
2125 2018-11-13 20:59:43 Dubai discovered Swiss oil 
Why
Nigerian discovered China/Indian oil "(Imitation per excellence)
2126 2018-11-13 20:59:38 Reminder: Oil will never break $100 in my lifetime, and I plan on living forever.
2127 2018-11-13 20:59:33 CL oil is definitely short-term oversold here. Commodities can really rip but this would be a ridiculous fall if it crashes from here. $USO $fut_CL #crudeoil #oil
2128 2018-11-13 20:59:33 maybe consider that not invading sovereign countries for oil isnt actually an extreme leftist stance and is just the only moral stance to take on the issue
2129 2018-11-13 20:59:25 why the fuck do people put coconut oil on their face
2130 2018-11-13 20:59:19 So, we may never know the motive?
2131 2018-11-13 20:59:04 I payed for my first oil change last week and lemme tell ya.... NEVER AGAIN
2132 2018-11-13 20:59:04 Get in the oil field lol
2133 2018-11-13 20:59:03 @ASOS_HeretoHelp  Hey,  I need some help!! Oil is broken, just won't go up. I've been trying to contact you all week but no response, now I'm on the brink of getting my P45 in the post. Please help. Thanks
2134 2018-11-13 20:58:57 The oil narrative *for which there is no evidence* is also complete nonsense. Never mind the logistics of just “taking the oil”. I’m glad you’ve both established yourselves as islamists now though, literally apologizing for 9/11.
2135 2018-11-13 20:58:57 I came here for a oil change and dassit ... stop telling me all the other shit I need cus I’m uh broke ok
2136 2018-11-13 20:58:53 Economy is failing so what is the 1st tool in the Fed's HFT toolbox? To save face rather than admit that they have killed Bernie in our "Weekend At Bernie's" economy they in collusion with the US Treasury ESF hit the price of #Oil. This is stealth QE. @LukeGromen @LeopoldHeinrich
2137 2018-11-13 20:58:45 Well we’ve burned every other asset so the field open - now we need to start a Crypto distressed asset fund and buy up Big Tech and the Oil companies for 30c in the $ - arbitrage innit.
2138 2018-11-13 20:58:43 lots of olive oil and whack the heat up higher for 10 minutes at the end right
2139 2018-11-13 20:58:34 Hassan Minaj did a great bit on Sunday about Oil, it’s on Netflix, and worth checking out.
2140 2018-11-13 20:58:31 Hi friends! 

Daily reminder to NEVER drink essential oils (or put them directly on skin). Essential oils are very powerful and potent substances that have some amazing medicinal properties. 

But, as we all know, oil and water don't mix!
2141 2018-11-13 20:58:27 fuck the palm oil industry
2142 2018-11-13 20:58:15 It’s sooo tough to pick the most despicable arsehole in our political league table of snake oil salespeople. I would have to say that David Davis comes pretty fucking close to the top though.
2143 2018-11-13 20:58:10 Murphy's Oil on wooden floors.
2144 2018-11-13 20:58:02 Problem of course is the politics behind it, and no one can lobby or own politicians like the oil and gas. And with Trump? They’re going to dig their way to the chewy core.
2145 2018-11-13 20:58:01 @david__belle I blame Eric Choe for this oil dump.  He's shorting it all the way down to $8 just to spite you.
2146 2018-11-13 20:57:49 Trust me I won't . Can you still get a gauge for oil tanks and are they accurate and are the worth it . I know the dipstick works fine but if I had a gauge I could cast me eye at it whenever I'm passing.
2147 2018-11-13 20:57:47 Oil and gas prices are falling soon this will translate to more retail spending as well as online spending which will boost the economy is my guess thanks Trump
2148 2018-11-13 20:57:43 8,000 miles overdue for an oil change..my daddy got in my car & got so pissed lmao 
2149 2018-11-13 20:57:39 Had to wait till track 8 for a decent sound. Sad
2150 2018-11-13 20:57:29 Given about 12% of the account I’m trading this out of to oil so far. Been trying to catch it since $62 WTI but was obviously way off base. About 50% of purchases were today ~$57, redeemable.
2151 2018-11-13 20:57:25 The reality is every Special Interest group & provinces/cities want a piece of the action.  Pipelines should be “built in national interest”.  That won’t happen LPC in power.  Trudeau, his party, NDP & Green Party want Oil left in the ground
2152 2018-11-13 20:57:11 Well, more practice is always good for any artist, but "my art looks cheap" is not necessarily an indication that it is badly made. For one thing, are you comparing apples to apples? If you draw in a comic book style and compare it to a oil painting style artwork, that's two
2153 2018-11-13 20:57:09 Oil prices below $55 a barrel, soon they will be paying us to put gas in our cars
2154 2018-11-13 20:57:06 Alhamdulillah
2155 2018-11-13 20:56:54 CBOT Dec wht gown A$6.78, giving up a lot of Monday night’s gains. Exports for the last week did not show any growth. All grains hit by drop in crude oil. Russian wht remaining competitive with lower currency.
2156 2018-11-13 20:56:51 Coconut oil is essential rn
2157 2018-11-13 20:56:42 You can't be that negative to Iceland highlighting the Greenpeace video. If it helps to slow palm oil production that should be commended. I'm sure the Attenborough household still uses some plastic.
2158 2018-11-13 20:56:37 Win Jan canola down A$3.53/t & EU rape down A$3.35. Oilseeds and grains hit by sharp slide in crude oil prices. Support for US soybeans came from strong export numbers & from renewed trade talks with China.
2159 2018-11-13 20:56:32 Lower Oil will actually boost inflation because of increased consumer spending in turn forcing the Fed to hike 4 times.
2160 2018-11-13 20:56:31 no thanks I'm fine with mineral oil as placebo
2161 2018-11-13 20:56:31 @KatiePavlich Hey whats up with the crude oil prices plunging? My job is base on the production of crude oil. The lower prices are the least amount of crude oil gets produced. They gonna make me get back on the block OPEC need to tighten up!
2162 2018-11-13 20:56:24 There needs to be an option to report ads for selling snake oil type products.
2163 2018-11-13 20:56:21 Today we learned
Clove Oil > Orajel 
HANDS DOWN
also. Functions as a lip plumper when you accidentally get it outside of your mouth LoL
2164 2018-11-13 20:56:15 Che dici dell’oil?  pesantino
2165 2018-11-13 20:56:13 This was what they decided on *in 2016*.

The idea that the Democrats aren't right there with the GOP as being utterly terrible for global action on climate change is absurd.

Remember when Obama bugged the Copenhagen delegates, sabotaging the conference? The oil boom?
2166 2018-11-13 20:56:08 What about tasche oil and grooming kits?
2167 2018-11-13 20:55:46 Stg I'm like tin-man without his oil. Lmao
2168 2018-11-13 20:55:44 Loool...shey you go discover oil and na only you go benefit from the oil??
2169 2018-11-13 20:55:43 Obvious alt-right maga hat wearer?
2170 2018-11-13 20:55:42 now is another example.

i made a fortune trading oil and gold futures in 06 and 07. lost my shirt when i doubled down when oil pulled back from 150 to 140 in 08.

never traded oil again. it was a tough lesson but i learned it.

later triggered brexit in the gold market.
2171 2018-11-13 20:55:40 Double checks accounts for #energy #oil stocks, finds a stray, sighs.
2172 2018-11-13 20:55:38 As the price of Oil goes. So will the economy.
@POTUS
2173 2018-11-13 20:55:32 Oil does not moisturize your hair. Thanks. -Mangt.
2174 2018-11-13 20:55:29 Only my mum could mistake sun protection oil for hair serum 
2175 2018-11-13 20:55:27 Good...then maybe we can have our tax dollars back.  When Russia cuts off your oil and invades don't ask for us to get involved.
2176 2018-11-13 20:55:19 Just drink kernel oil
2177 2018-11-13 20:55:15 I saw Trumpy Bear commercial well over a year ago. Running low on anything current to mock POTUS over, having to reach backwards?
2178 2018-11-13 20:55:07 Saw one of those guys mention North Dakota and well, the big reason why ND has done well recently is the government essentially bending over backward for the oil companies and damning anything else.  ND  has also put at least some money and effort into Education as well.
2179 2018-11-13 20:55:06 I love how socially acceptable CBD oil is becoming
2180 2018-11-13 20:55:01 I have the best Snake Oil south of Iber River.
2181 2018-11-13 20:54:53 Crude oil falls for 12 th day in a row. WTI Trading below $55 today.
Watch for lower gasoline prices soon.
2182 2018-11-13 20:54:42 When those American oil field jobs are lost he may sing a different tune.
2183 2018-11-13 20:54:41 @IcelandFoods @CadburyUK   thank you for highlighting the palm oil problem and orangutan s plight. 
2184 2018-11-13 20:54:35 เก็บตังเด็ก อิ่มป้ะล้ะ เลย 
2185 2018-11-13 20:54:23 I am darkskinded I need oil. Not butter
2186 2018-11-13 20:54:12 US inflation and employment will weaken as drillers lay off workers and cancel orders for mfr goods. Knock on effects are big for pipes/rigs/vehicles/tools/engineering/laywers/tractors/trucks etc.   The weather rally in gas will soon breakdown and follow the oil price down
2187 2018-11-13 20:54:11 All reporters should walk out. Take the oil away from the fire. #trump #FakeNews #JimAcosta
2188 2018-11-13 20:54:07 $Oil $DWT so much better than $BTC #Bitcoin right now 
2189 2018-11-13 20:53:57 I think they might be one of few using sustainable palm oil?? They say they do...
2190 2018-11-13 20:53:57 Haha I have so much coconut oil I could make his hair soft for more than a year 
2191 2018-11-13 20:53:57 Oil and pot baby!  I'm buying up on discount lol!
2192 2018-11-13 20:53:55 Agreed, I don't pretend to be that clever as to pinpoint the exact turning point. Oil had already collapsed upward of 20% and a bounce did not occur. At a fib retracement it was worth taking a long. Not sure how many saw today's collapse coming.
2193 2018-11-13 20:53:54 That's because she gives good #Lewinskis.
2194 2018-11-13 20:53:52 Instructions:
1. preheat oven to 175 Celsius

2. Mix your wet ingredients - eggs and coconut oil/butter, then add your dry ingredients - cocoa powder, baking powder, coconut flour, vanilla extract and erythritol (or your sweetener of choice).
2195 2018-11-13 20:53:46 Gotta love the oil industry asking the government to bail it out even as oil-industry proponents of the Canoe kind simultaneously think that there's too much government red tape.
2196 2018-11-13 20:53:37 Is this the point in the movie where the Chief takes Mueller’s badge and gun?
Then M goes rogue when T kidnaps his daughter.
They have a showdown on an oil tanker.
And M blasts him into orbit with a rocket launcher.
“Justice...”
*sunglasses*
“... is served.”
*roll credits*
2197 2018-11-13 20:53:35 oil and rbob gas to the down side big time today.  they have been going down since october.  seems to be no bottom.
2198 2018-11-13 20:53:31 Ding Tai Fung. I loved the shredded yuba salad with sesame oil when I was there in August.
2199 2018-11-13 20:53:31 I want regulation to the extent it stifles another Depression, stifles acid rain, unbreathable air, rivers on fire, oil and dead birds/fish on beaches, mass shootings, Ponzi schemes, etc. Regulations are great when what they regulate is bad. Regulation for its own sake is bad.

2201 2018-11-13 20:53:21 I agree, it will take a massive and thorough shift at the center of gravity to really get some oil into this nation's engines and get it running again. A little bit of pain,inconvenience, painstaking or hard earned money and time is too little to give....we all can do better.
2202 2018-11-13 20:53:19 Cue the breakeven oil price articles in 5, 4, 3....
2203 2018-11-13 20:53:15 Ingredients:
4 large or 5 medium eggs
1/4 cup coconut flour
1/4 cup coconut oil
4 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp vanilla extract
4 tbsp granulated sweetener (I used Swerve)
2 oz / 50 g dark chocolate chopped
2204 2018-11-13 20:53:11 yes, ate boiled yam and palm oil coupled with various obstacles, those ukpaka and orishirishi they use to put inside 
2205 2018-11-13 20:53:10 Lol, what happens when she needs Pelosi to help a bill of hers.
2206 2018-11-13 20:53:01 The same. I use the natural ones. Rose oil/water or rosehip oil is generally used to help the elasticity of your skin, radiate and moisturize your skin, and help fade scars
2207 2018-11-13 20:53:01 Castor oil
2208 2018-11-13 20:53:00 The day I see the Conservative party put forward an embargo on Saudi oil is the day I’ll buy this bullshit argument
2209 2018-11-13 20:52:59 Lol. Don't know . I don't film waste tankers . Just Oil.
2210 2018-11-13 20:52:45 I love the smell of tea tree oil
2211 2018-11-13 20:52:36 Multiple Questions on the selloff in crude oil today.   Yes, it's oversold.  Yes it could go lower.  I've never liked the "falling knife" trade with nothing else to support it.   Here's a few observations:
2212 2018-11-13 20:52:33 Oilsands have oil mixed with sand... Dirtiest oil is mixed with blood.   Our LNG and oil isn't responsible for the state of the planet.  Over population is.  SO bringing in millions to overpopulate Canada is more of a risk than shipping oil to China.
2213 2018-11-13 20:52:20 I suppose that's oil coming through Belfast.. 
Don't go tilting the tank or anything like that.....
2214 2018-11-13 20:52:15 Oil tankers speed.. 16 knots... 
Frigate 27 knots..

Did the frigate have his L plates on...
2215 2018-11-13 20:52:08 Palm oil certification body @RSPOtweets will only be credible if its #palmoil growers like @Indofood eradicate exploitation, deforestation & destruction of ecologically precious peatland from plantations. They must use this weeks’ P&C vote well! #RT16 #RSPO
2216 2018-11-13 20:52:08 When you have a head cold, Olbas Oil is the MVP.
2217 2018-11-13 20:52:07 Witch Hazel is easy to find, it just depends on the brand you go for. I got mine at dollar general because it’s all the same. It lightens your acne scars and dries out current blemishes. And then I follow with all natural rose oil. The one I use is sold out but again, it’s all
2218 2018-11-13 20:52:05 It's like right out of an episode of The Simpsons: "We want to drill for oil in Teddy Roosevelt's head!"
2219 2018-11-13 20:52:04 Oil is down -7% today.
2220 2018-11-13 20:52:02 So are we gonna start seeing some $WTI shops pile into #natgas here with the shit-kicking of oil?
2221 2018-11-13 20:51:57 Dallas isn't the hub of oil, so alot of the business travel is services like IT, software, etc...it's a small proportion of steel toes relative to the Houston flights.
2222 2018-11-13 20:51:56 I think it is CBC or CTV who keeps posting articles empathizing with the oil industry who has to sell their resources below cost because their pipeline isn't being built fast enough.

They claim they are losing billions a year.

Maybe it's time they move to new industries?
2223 2018-11-13 20:51:55 volatility is now spilling over into other asset. Crude Oil is a good example. Is that characteristic of healthy uptrending markets where we want to be buying stocks or downtrending markets where we want to be selling them?
2224 2018-11-13 20:51:55 True that, we want banga oil but we no want mash palm nut. That’s the generation we in and it hurts to be a part of it.
2225 2018-11-13 20:51:55 i just put less of the oil in hAHA
2226 2018-11-13 20:51:44 8.5k sir
2227 2018-11-13 20:51:40 Urgent vote to transform the #palmoil industry! RT to tell palm oil body @RSPOtweets to become credible & adopt ‘No #Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ policies in its new rules - and enforce them against @Indofood too!  #RT16 #RSPO
2228 2018-11-13 20:51:31 But like why though?
2229 2018-11-13 20:51:30 Man, what is going on with the OIH?  Are @elonmusk and @GerberKawasaki leading a bear raid on oil and oil stocks?
2230 2018-11-13 20:51:25 Do you actually know and realize that the return profits of the curse we have, The Oil is 93+% are for the royal family DIRECTLY and then 7% goes for the ministers and almost 1% goes for the country. 
Who is the fucking REAL CRIMINAL OF THEIF here?
2231 2018-11-13 20:51:23 You can't be that negative to Iceland for trying to slow or stop palm oil production. It's a start and should be commended. I'm sure the Attenborough household still uses some plastic.

2233 2018-11-13 20:51:13 Well I'm a pasta man, so I grab the cheapest pasta I can find, break it up into a microwavable bowl fill it with water, heat that shit up for 25 minutes. Then if you have a frying pan through a touch of olive oil or canola then throw it in. Then fry it up and add whatever spice.
2234 2018-11-13 20:51:10 WHY are oil changes so expensive 
2235 2018-11-13 20:51:09 they don't taste like spinach but they're pretty flavourless so I'm definitely gonna try and make them again but add some herbs/spices! and it's just like a wrap but it's not as flexible if that makes sense? like normal wraps have a lot of oil in them so they're more bendy
2236 2018-11-13 20:51:07 @DaveHcontrarian  Are you impressed by the big downmove of oil. I am impr. and I am in favor of an upward move, but I can't imagine to reach 3000.
2237 2018-11-13 20:51:06 It’s not often that oil is down 8% while rockets rain over populated areas in northern Middle East. I hope markets now understand that places like Israel & Palestine really have no impact on oil. The focus should ONLY be on the oil producing nations. Anything extra is irrelevant.

2245 2018-11-13 20:50:26 If you think the revenue off the oil rigs (approx £5bn to £6bn) would provide enough money to pay for your free prescriptions, student fees and everything else you get whilst in the union you're deluding yourself.
2246 2018-11-13 20:50:16 @jimcramer I'm an idiot. For years I have been dabbling in oil/gas stocks & lost my shirt almost every time. Suddenly it dawned on my idiot brain that to make money at this government influenced, crony market, you almost have to have inside govt info. Time to get out and stay out
2247 2018-11-13 20:50:05 Domino effect- US DOLLAR rises, emerging markets currencies get hit by interest on debt payments, oil falls, , Semiconductors falls, European & EM banks need to fail next along with transportation and we should have Chaos. SOUNDS like make America great again. Strategy 101

2249 2018-11-13 20:49:52 is tricking the Saudis by luring about the sanction levels worth losing your credibility?  This will cost them billions not to mention the strain on their oil system to produce at such a high rate to cooperate with the Pres.  going forward expect little cooperation

2252 2018-11-13 20:49:51 Cheapest quote for North Kildare at the moment is €747 I think I can last for about 2 more weeks before buying hoping to see another drop in price before I order.  Always puzzles me how Donegal is nearly always the lowest price for heating oil.

2256 2018-11-13 20:49:38 Delta State used to be an oil producing state or it still an oil producing state but look at it now all the major or big companies have either left or have closed up, bad roads everywhere, pensioners are dyeing of hunger mean while their money is with govt.
2257 2018-11-13 20:49:32 Mix castor oil with your lotion. Put it on while ur still damp from a shower or bath. And for your face, use a toner or refresher spray and then vit e oil on top
2258 2018-11-13 20:49:28 Buy me 5litre oil  plz while you there
2259 2018-11-13 20:49:23 This is ridiculous. Low oil prices helps EVERY other sector EXCEPT energy. From dramatically reduced costs for transportation and shipping of product, to lower commuting expense, we are ALL ahead. It only drags down the indexes because big oil stocks are IN them.
2260 2018-11-13 20:49:21 Not nearly as subsidized as the oil & gas industry is!
2261 2018-11-13 20:49:19 My oil on 13% 
2262 2018-11-13 20:49:17 Ugh I miss oil painting so much I really want to just take a day out to paint 
2263 2018-11-13 20:49:14 Mint oil rub on forehead, back of head, temporal sand massage then put cold towel
2264 2018-11-13 20:49:12 Yes all that and maybe to set up a fund to clean up messes left behind by companies that go bankrupt. Google Giant Mine and abandoned oil wells in Alberta to name just a few.  Maybe companies involved in environmentally risky business should pay a pollution security deposit.
2265 2018-11-13 20:49:11 Maybe the guy with the $400 oil call?
2266 2018-11-13 20:49:08 Man oil got me good today. Should be able to recover in a few days. But holy shit how many people did this blow up today wow wow wow
2267 2018-11-13 20:49:06 LMAO...and everyone thinks #crypto is unstable look at #oil
2268 2018-11-13 20:49:05 Wow. The price of a barrel of oil fell by 8 percent today. That's nuts.

2270 2018-11-13 20:48:52 Not THAT kind of snake oil! The kind that makes this guy look like a piece of shit human! The REAL kind! #sarcasm
2271 2018-11-13 20:48:29 Crude oil buried, dead and gone.  down 8% plus today ALONE.  Very worried about what this means for inflation and global demand going forward.
2272 2018-11-13 20:48:28 Nope. Crashing oil. Tariffs. And daily headlines on regulation and whoever is in your crosshairs sir!
2273 2018-11-13 20:48:21 Yes.  And oil investors won’t be able to afford 1 fucking gallon.
2274 2018-11-13 20:48:13 My dog has his own jar of coconut oil lol what a spoiled brat
2275 2018-11-13 20:48:08 VELHO AGORA ENCONTREI O OIL MAN KKKDKDNDKEJDJJ que dia abençoado
2276 2018-11-13 20:48:03 Oil down 8.18%

2277 2018-11-13 20:48:01 Wash it down with some olive oil and gnaw on a garlic clove. If anyone asks say you had Italian for lunch.

2279 2018-11-13 20:47:54 just learned that one of my professional references wrote in their reference “he burns as the midnight oil like no one i’ve ever heard of” & the moral of this story is I got the job so
2280 2018-11-13 20:47:53 omg my parents put coconut oil on my dog to make his hair nice and shiny and now they wanna show him off at the dog park 
2281 2018-11-13 20:47:51 This Cheesecake Factory Cobb salad taste like there’s sesame oil in it not horrible but not great either and I like sesame oil
2282 2018-11-13 20:47:48 How does one oil paint?
2283 2018-11-13 20:47:44 @CNBC and everyone pushing $100 oil 6 weeks ago just got BTFO $USO
2284 2018-11-13 20:47:43 CBOT Dec wht gown A$6.78, giving up a lot of Monday night’s gains. Exports for the last week did not show any growth. All grains hit by drop in crude oil. Russian wht remaining competitive with lower currency.
2285 2018-11-13 20:47:34 Jide Omokore, Aluko & oil goddess "Alinson Dizane Madueke" made an Oil deal of #1Trillion & chose not to remit (a dime) to Nigeria under GEJ. Did anyone raise eye brow? 

Festus Keyamo, SAN

Oh my God #1T 
The choice b4 us is btw light & darkness.
No going back to darkness era.
2286 2018-11-13 20:47:31 What I would do:

-Rejoin Paris deal and lead the charge for further int’l commitments
-Reinstate Obama regulations
-Carbon tax (politically tricky today)
-Clean energy incentives, job retraining programs for workers losing their coal/oil jobs
-Believe science
2287 2018-11-13 20:47:26 LMAO! Dude just asked “is this warm enough for you” nigga if u soooo hot then go sit your ass outside in the cold. I’m gon be comfortable me. Unless my oil change free 
2288 2018-11-13 20:47:23 Yo if I have to hear about the damn sea turtles when I ask for a straw, I’m about to pull up CHARTS on how ALL TYPES OF PLASTIC stem from the use of crude oil companies that do not pay the $58+ BILLION in taxes cause they get subsides from the government
2289 2018-11-13 20:47:18 Something that ppl ignore but oil crash is JPY negative. most inflation in japan is oil driven
2290 2018-11-13 20:47:10 Issnor fair ooooo. See ehhh for best effect pour groundnut oil or use Vaseline. You go shine die
2291 2018-11-13 20:47:08 She’s clearly taking after you. Fab! Have you let her use your oil paints yet?
2292 2018-11-13 20:47:05 That was the period with most sonar pings and under and overwater explosions and oil spils. Might be related no?
2293 2018-11-13 20:47:03 all i want for christmas is some beard oil and to cum from head

2296 2018-11-13 20:46:55 I put castor oil on my ends the day before I wash my hair so maybe like 3-4 times a month
2297 2018-11-13 20:46:50 run for your life it's steven's bottle of oil
2298 2018-11-13 20:46:48 I agree, yet I see a lot of vegans being very dismissive about the impacts of palm oil. Ditching animal products is a good start but it's not the full story. But I think we agree on that 
2299 2018-11-13 20:46:41 to be honest oil was at $20 ten years ago
2300 2018-11-13 20:46:39 Oil now down 8% on the day...
2301 2018-11-13 20:46:35 Allah kasamu aljanna da rahmarka
2302 2018-11-13 20:46:32 Looking at today's price action, 1200 seems to be the point where it won't budge lower. Even with Oil down 7%. Who knows why exactly that level, maybe the leverage on the Comex is blowing out or something. In any case, that gives us a good idea what will happen to Oil...
2303 2018-11-13 20:46:32 But he is just focusing on oil prices.  His comments bring the market down - and for which he blames "Dems"
2304 2018-11-13 20:46:30 Pasta with garlic & olive oil. Pasta with marinara, mixed greens, peppers, etc. Rice with carrots, peas, onions, vegan protein, etc. in soy or teriyaki. Veggie (carrots, potatoes, onions, vegan meat[less]balls) soup made with Better Than Boulion (chick’n, beefless, etc.) broth.
2305 2018-11-13 20:46:30 The answer is not sitting back and doing nothing. If the rich and the oil companies think letting the world burn while they hide in little enclaves or fly off into space, it won't work forever. See: The Masque of the Red Death by Edgar Allen Poe. Playing ostrich won't help anyone
2306 2018-11-13 20:46:24 Thank you for getting back to me! I’m glad to hear! Do you currently have any sustainable/palm oil free shampoo/conditioners on the market? Thank you 
2307 2018-11-13 20:46:24 Do you just let the braids be or do you oil and grease your scalp?
2308 2018-11-13 20:46:21 Oil and Brent oil per barrel lowest price today since November 2017!
2309 2018-11-13 20:46:16 Allah ka gafartaman
2310 2018-11-13 20:46:15 Oil is finally going in right direction
2311 2018-11-13 20:46:14 Could be a shocker tomorrow for oil stocks. Brent oil 7.5% down
2312 2018-11-13 20:46:13 oil filter homie
2313 2018-11-13 20:46:12 Que hara Axion esta vez ?? Bajara precio nafta con semejante caida ??  Esperara cierre viernes para ver semanalmente precio oil vs dolar ?
2314 2018-11-13 20:46:08 Many vegan cookbooks include palm oil products as an alternative to dairy-based. 
2315 2018-11-13 20:46:04 Tonight’s Grilled Flatbread Pizza

2316 2018-11-13 20:46:04 Definitely not trolling. Demand for oil is relatively inelastic and every time gasoline goes to (or near) $4, it crashes consumer spending. This *is* a tax.
2317 2018-11-13 20:46:04 Allah ka yimana muwafaka
2318 2018-11-13 20:46:01 yeesh, crude oil. They all fall down $OIL

2320 2018-11-13 20:45:54 But Crude Oil plunge is signaling something different... it's saying "Global growth is going to suck, you better GTFO!"
2321 2018-11-13 20:45:54 Where can I find all of it. And what kind of oil?
2322 2018-11-13 20:45:43 $cei  can #oil recover faster than it fell ?  and can NATURAL GAS TAKE A FASTER SPIKE THAN IT HAS ALLREADY ?
2323 2018-11-13 20:45:38 $APPL down because $BA and $OIL and it's a DOW BABY and a $FAANG baby.

Sad.
2324 2018-11-13 20:45:38 i think now sell side will say oil is going to $20 again
2325 2018-11-13 20:45:38 Tried my first coconut oil treatment on my hair bc I noticed it was getting so dry & damaged. I give it two thumbs up already; my hair was so soft & easy to brush. Left it in for 2 hours then washed & conditioned. Hoping for good results from more treatments 
2326 2018-11-13 20:45:37 U ever see someone’s face who is EXTREEEEMELY oily and u jus wanna swipe out an oil pad and blot their face 
2327 2018-11-13 20:45:35 Yeah so much for peak oil. They lie coming and going.
2328 2018-11-13 20:45:32 #fuelprice highest for many years, oil and brent oil just now lowest for 12 months. Lower costs not being passed on? Public being fucked again!!
2329 2018-11-13 20:45:28 It is interesting to read that BP based their logo off of the environment, knowing that they had the huge crisis a while back where they took the brunt of the blame for the huge oil leak in the gulf.  #acpr205 #chapter1

2332 2018-11-13 20:45:23 Toast jujube and white radish. Sprinkle with a touch of olive oil.
2333 2018-11-13 20:45:20 I love palm oil I don't bother going to Iceland.
2334 2018-11-13 20:45:18 With OIL taking a nose dive... Feb $55 straddle good to consider
2335 2018-11-13 20:45:17 Why in the 'ell is AOC protesting in Nancy Pelosi offices? Why isn't she protesting Reoublucans who deny climate change & it's effect on our planet & pass legislation for more oil drilling
2336 2018-11-13 20:45:13 I need an oil change
2337 2018-11-13 20:45:12 @SenSchumer hey being in Buffalo and paying over $3 a gallon of gas is sad??  Well Chuck I'm a retired Marine, guarded all those oil Wells!! How about a cut!!
2338 2018-11-13 20:45:12 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2339 2018-11-13 20:45:09 I need to go get an oil change and my car detailed
2340 2018-11-13 20:45:07 i prefer red oil instead
2341 2018-11-13 20:45:01 Price of oil down. Saudis and Iran Plus Syria can't make money at 54 a barrel War will increase the price Coming Soon
2342 2018-11-13 20:44:59 @WiseSolution or something along those lines. Oil getting very crushed and is very oversold and heavily shorted. Should reverse soon imo
2343 2018-11-13 20:44:57 If I were the Saudis I would not trust the US on oil going forward.  They were mislead about sanctions and it will costs them billions only to have even more threats by the Pres now.  work hard/pump more for sanctions only to have rug pulled out? Not the art of the deal
2344 2018-11-13 20:44:48 wahi to  season shuru hua hai r oil ki to forever refinery hai 
2345 2018-11-13 20:44:36 We could see capitulation here . Happy to stay long $ now we have weakness in € and oil.

Debt ceiling doesn’t come into effect until March, and china’s stimulus, tho an X factor, won’t be anything near Shanghai acc.

It may be too late by then
2346 2018-11-13 20:44:35 My house is clean, my oil burning got it smelling good vacuum lines in the carpet  my type of day!
2347 2018-11-13 20:44:20 Lol.

Scotland would be utterly dependent on oil and gas revenues - the sums didn't add up with oil at $100 per barrel let alone today.
2348 2018-11-13 20:44:20 Looks right from long term macro trends perspective... Electric cars will require gas fired power stations instead of oil. Enormous pipelines being laid in Asia. Of course short term demand supply in play...
2349 2018-11-13 20:44:18 Win Jan canola down A$3.53/t & EU rape down A$3.35. Oilseeds and grains hit by sharp slide in crude oil prices. Support for US soybeans came from strong export numbers & from renewed trade talks with China.
2350 2018-11-13 20:44:10 Are we hearing the oil at 30 $ predictions already?
2351 2018-11-13 20:44:00 Oil prices are going to break something else. Huge 2nd and 3rd degree relation trades coming on this carnage. We will know by tomorrow night or Thursday.
#wti #crash #blackswan #SaudiArabia
2352 2018-11-13 20:43:59 Could we legislate against any product imported with Palm Oil or it's byproduct PKE? I think the population would be behind this as the Orangutans are being slaughtered and it affects global warming. I won't mind if my yogurt isn't so creamy or my shampoo quite as slimy.
2353 2018-11-13 20:43:54 @WiseSolution I'm hoping they say (if not I'll ask during cc) that with Adler acquisition now they can reach profitability with oil at $40
2354 2018-11-13 20:43:53 I know I’ve been tweeting about palm oil & plastic which some might argue isn’t a vegan issue but I am STRESSED
2355 2018-11-13 20:43:51 Y’all ever ate a tomato and garlic with oil sandwich or is that just a poor Cuban thing
2356 2018-11-13 20:43:46 We will not run out of oil or gas, most fracking gas is just released or burned off, and humans will die of oil combustion long before it runs out.  USA, Canada just want to export the surplus rather than conserve for future
2357 2018-11-13 20:43:37 6.6% down, brent oil ends at $65.47 a barrel

2360 2018-11-13 20:43:32 so many tweets and responses, I have deleted. Today seems like an inflection point for many markets. $CL $NG $ES oil does not seem priced correctly RSI is over sold IMO but we broke the TL 
2361 2018-11-13 20:43:28 Fair! I will say it is VERY SOFT. I usually use the Clinique cleansing oil but this took off even my matte liquid lipstick and eye makeup with barely any scrubbing & after my 2nd cleanse there was nothing on my towel whereas there’s still usually a bit w/ my cleansing oil.
2362 2018-11-13 20:43:23 Most people would classify the following as vegetable oils (the bad oils); rapeseed (canola oil), soybean, corn, sunflower, safflower, peanut, etc. Olive + coco = good healthy fatty oils. Don't typically seen them labelled as such.
2363 2018-11-13 20:43:22 The land was on top of the water. Founded on top. Lots of pressure. When the land began sinking, (the birth of the oceans) water squirted out along the fault lines creating those huge trilobite graveyards from which we get oil soak and cat sand.
2364 2018-11-13 20:43:12 Identity politics at it’s most blatant. These cretins are playing to their audience. I’ve noticed no redress of the gender imbalance when it comes to bricklayers, roofers, oil riggers, long distance lorry drivers, deep sea fishing or sewage and refuse disposal etc.
2365 2018-11-13 20:43:12 Or Brie Larson's post, that was her posing with a clear view of her designer shoes and purse, going "oh Stan, so saaad"; or Gwyneth Palthrow's even worse: an ad for her retarded snake oil products with an update, "oh no Stan died!"
2366 2018-11-13 20:43:12 Of course they are....it's a BS plea to no one in particular. At best it's a PR campaign at worst it's smoke and mirrors on behalf of the oil industry....which just in case people need reminding? doesn't move our economy in the way they imagine.

2372 2018-11-13 20:42:48 It is the same old story with the VIX remaining relatively subdued during this correction--Bull case for stocks: Not much to worry about despite oil, $GS, $AAPL weakness, etc...Bear case for stocks: Market remains very complacent and will soon see heavier selling to instill fear.
2373 2018-11-13 20:42:45 From Traditional confirmation to what's going on in Georgia and Florida! 
Democracy and Democrats mix as well as oil and water they just don't go together!

2375 2018-11-13 20:42:27 @jimcramer Any thoughts on Cabot Oil and Gas now? Improved outlook all around and market improved?
2376 2018-11-13 20:42:24 The EIA reports the price of oil back to 1986. Since that time the correlation between the price of oil (Cushing OK WTI) and the return of the S&P 500 over rolling periods tells me it’s maybe not a useful signal. 

1-Month: 0.04
1-Year: 0.17
3-Year: -0.10
5-Year: -0.34
2377 2018-11-13 20:42:19 Brutal day for oil bulls. 

Brent crude oil drops below $65/bbl in after hours trading, down more than 7%. 

WTI below $55/bbl, off 8%

Hedge funds sending clear message to Opec+ but they’re not just trying to force a cut. They’re saying they don’t think Opec+ can fix this #OOTT
2378 2018-11-13 20:42:05 I would say douse it in some oil and cook it through. You should be good.
2379 2018-11-13 20:41:57 @CadburyUK I tried to find a chocolate bar at lunch today that didn't contain palm oil and I couldn't find anything on the shelves. Can you fix this so I can eat chocolate again please?
2380 2018-11-13 20:41:49 Not a chance that's gonna happen. UEFA is oil fc
2381 2018-11-13 20:41:38 @NZGreens How about a bill to ban Palm Oil (in products as well as raw form), and its byproduct PKE in NZ? As well as the sad fate of Orangutans it's contributing to global warming. This should be easy.
2382 2018-11-13 20:41:37 @mattjwatkins hiya sorry to hear about the cancer always being with I bet you have had loads of options and I’m no dr or nurse but have u tried that CBD oil to see if that could help you #cancersucks x

2397 2018-11-13 20:40:09 I wonder what Ja Rule say about this oil sell off?

2400 2018-11-13 20:39:40 Safi safi :( think good thoughts and your car won't even need an oil change 
2401 2018-11-13 20:39:36 Since Nov 14, I’ve been UNCERTAIN what framework OPEC is using to guide its strategy and tactics.  Instead it appears they have become oil traders and FOCUS on ST prices.
2402 2018-11-13 20:39:32 Really tied it all in with Russia blaming Israel >> not about Gaza but about oil.  Great update!
2403 2018-11-13 20:39:29 For the world to live and flourish? we MUST end war nuclear weapons and all bombs, missiles, nuclear power plants and big oil energy for our power and transportation  we must end dirty money in governments we must end profits over people and planet economy
2404 2018-11-13 20:39:23 I disagree. Look at the net MM positioning, as of Tuesday November 6th, it was at ~180, what do you think it is this second, after oil has lost another $7
2405 2018-11-13 20:39:22 Keep Austin Weird is the official slogan of Austin independent business alliance
2406 2018-11-13 20:39:18 6)out oil field 's? Aren't the military trained 2 organize/secure/rescue ppl in the event of a disaster? It's coming up on the winter months which is going 2 effect tourism in FL & CA. The holidays r coming up & ×1000's of ppl r without a home/job/!
2407 2018-11-13 20:39:18 Oil prices going where? please don't go..
2408 2018-11-13 20:39:14 After a good parents evening with one and the other having exams, I said yes to sweets but not those that contain Palm Oil. That reduced the choice by about 99%. I can live with the 1%

2411 2018-11-13 20:38:59 Stop buying palm oil from rainforest destroyers @Oreo. #TasteTheDestruction #DropDirtyPalmOil #Oreo @GreenpeaceUK
2412 2018-11-13 20:38:58 Among crowd this guy is only exception who amassed wealth w/ looting #minerals rest vl turn away once the mineral dry up, which is likely by 2040 by then #Odisha economy vl b like #gulf countries who relied heavily on #oil economy but now falling flat.
2413 2018-11-13 20:38:54 Oil boilers delivered next day too?
2414 2018-11-13 20:38:54 Yeah, my kids keep having a go at me for buying them peanut butter and chocolate spread because of the palm oil thing. They're right, this is wrong and @CadburyUK will have to find another way (that doesn't kill and destroy habitats and life).
Thanks.
2415 2018-11-13 20:38:52 Maybe I can do the "ladylike" thing and instead of punching them... make them chocolate chip cookies.

Chocolate chip cookies full of ex-lax, 'special oil' and *real ingredients*. (Ohhhh, they gonna get high, fat *and* get the poops! BUAHAHAHA!!)
2416 2018-11-13 20:38:51 Other way round. If you just leave an engine idling till it reaches that temperature the bores will start to glaze leading to excessive oil consumption. Warm slightly to allow oil to circulate and after a short tiem start riding gently with varied revs and load
2417 2018-11-13 20:38:49 Uw
2418 2018-11-13 20:38:43 We can’t afford our oil either.
2419 2018-11-13 20:38:37 Which is why we are talking about sustainable standards which promote the production of palm oil with minimal impact on wildlife, local people and the environment.
2420 2018-11-13 20:38:30 All depends on who you are. If you're a driver or an emerging market crude importer, yes, it's good. If you're a driller or an oil exporter, that's not great. A neutral observer like the International Energy Agency wants a stable price that's high enough to fund future supply.
2421 2018-11-13 20:38:27 The oil pen is the best invention. I wish this shit was around when I was living with my parents. I wouldn’t even have gone out I woulda just smoked it in my room while on MySpace lmao .
2422 2018-11-13 20:38:25 You're sick & tired of hearing just how many people realise you sell snake oil.
2423 2018-11-13 20:38:23 @MartinTillier So much for a an oil bounce.
2424 2018-11-13 20:38:21 I don't think we have seen real pain yet with $SPY. This Oil price rout is a MAJOR move. Expect some nasty moves soon.
2425 2018-11-13 20:38:18 Likewise except we would miss your oil. But not your cowardly brainwashed people...
2426 2018-11-13 20:38:17 Interesting paralell feel for sure today. 

11 days breaking all records didn't wash it out...needed a 8% drop on the 12th day?

pretty wild even for oil.

But I do like buying things at crazy lows with 12% distributions...like $GMLP
2427 2018-11-13 20:38:13 She's stealing it to get you gas and an oil change bc she's a mom and she's nice
2428 2018-11-13 20:38:12 I need to get my mind off the fact that I’m missing some oil paint until later today so I’m gonna paint completely out of my style and see what happens with some acrylic 
2429 2018-11-13 20:38:08 That's quite a GIF... I can smell the baby oil and steroids through the phone screen
2430 2018-11-13 20:38:04 Well as @FarmerBennyBoy said that is not good news for orangutan’s as palm oil is being used in its place which means a huge reduction in rainforest.
2431 2018-11-13 20:38:04 no worse heartbreak than going into work and the battery on your oil pen deader than shit
2432 2018-11-13 20:38:03 Yesterday, I saw an ad for pumpkin spice motor oil.
2433 2018-11-13 20:37:59 I put so many miles on my car I be needing an oil change damn near every 4-6 weeks
2434 2018-11-13 20:37:56 I would normally use sesame oil, but when in a pinch, good ol' butter works beautifully!

2439 2018-11-13 20:37:46 Hey, @Saudi_Aramco, how many retweets to run oil artificially back above $59 for tomorrow's OpEx?

Thanks.
2440 2018-11-13 20:37:40 in a few yr's no one on earth will ever use oil again ... it descend for zero ...by 2030 it won't even be used.. filtty product / yuck and good ridens
2441 2018-11-13 20:37:29 @Larry_Kudlow Please explain to #POTUS that oil is in a bear market and that is hurting the stock mkt & American oil workers.
2442 2018-11-13 20:37:22 Is our money tied to the price of Oil

2446 2018-11-13 20:37:15 Oil price is less than 10% above the oil price benchmark for Nigerian 2019 budget. Oil, whose volatility is worse than Bitcoin, accounts for 90% of Government revenue. 

Guess who’s living on a Ponzi scheme.
2447 2018-11-13 20:37:12 Then stop building pipelines. Conflating new investment in green energy with further propagating your outdated environmentally unconscionable infrastructure is just that: a misleading conflation designed to prop up the dying oil industry. We have 10 years to save the planet!
2448 2018-11-13 20:37:12 Oil prices down 30% the last month, prices at the pumps not even budged though. Rip off Britain again.

2450 2018-11-13 20:37:08 I have no problem admitting that those oil sources are problematic. I posted mainly because many oil sands advocates have difficulties admitting to others (and possibly themselves) that much of the oil from Alberta is also problematic for different reasons.

2453 2018-11-13 20:36:37 Shail oil is coming online at a speedy rate. There will be buyers for this. The more of it that comes online, the less likely traditional sourced oil will be bought. This ultimately will have an influence on the price.
2454 2018-11-13 20:36:35 Police Dispatch indicates that the black plume of smoke north of Broomfield is not an oil and gas fire, but a fire from a three car garage structure in the subdivision just south of the oil and gas pad at the intersection of County Road 4 and County Road 5.
2455 2018-11-13 20:36:29 the deadliest slip and slide has been created with over 50 bottles of dish wash and oil which will be the battleground for today's match
2456 2018-11-13 20:36:27 No but we keep the wheels turning.pull you English out a hole like the Thatcher years in the 80s they pumped oil like mad.
And 2008 the same .
And right now it's taking off again with New rigs off Shetland

2459 2018-11-13 20:36:10 $SRPT They’re making gene therapies. Not fish oil. What’s the deal.
2460 2018-11-13 20:36:04 I thought that Tom was smarter than that. We can't keep blaming a decline in oil prices as the cause of future woes . People are not as uninformed as they would like them to be .
2461 2018-11-13 20:36:01 Taking excedrin if you take meds, water, ice on the back of the neck, smelling coffee grinds helps subside it. Cool wash cloth over the eyes for about 15 min and just relax. CBD topicals help. Peppermint candy and oil helps.  Feel better.

*Crude oil. Get your heads out of the gutter.
2468 2018-11-13 20:35:29 How low are we going to go with oil?
2469 2018-11-13 20:35:27 @heisenbergrpt Oil feels like a puke here. Someone big seems like they are on the wrong side and puking (forced?). Amazing move after a long downtrend. Man there must be is pain out there.
2470 2018-11-13 20:35:14 On the same day oil drops one of the most on record (8%) as OPEC warns of a glut. Due to increasing renewables & govt/banks beginning to stop capex for long-term investment. Except Ireland. Today, Had a quote today for 2.5c / kWH for solar supply in Ireland. Bet that's not PR'ed!
2471 2018-11-13 20:35:06 UNTILL they update us we can`t be for sure what kind of wells they bought / or are buying/ but with oil down maybe we get some used ones cheap and maybe they planed for naty gas to go up , ANSWERS AHEAD OF US !
2472 2018-11-13 20:35:03 It’s days like today when oil is synonymous with the word “tanker”

2474 2018-11-13 20:34:47 Why on earth would WM ban it when it’s just another cash cow like Scotland’s oil was ?

2476 2018-11-13 20:34:43 Nothing is more humbling than having a good day thinking the only thing wrong with your car is needing an oil change

2479 2018-11-13 20:34:25 @BobPisani @petenajarian Lower oil is only a positive in every way. How do you guys change your opinion’s deli and how do you think lower oil is bad? It’s absurd opinion that you  have Bob in my opinion. Every piece of news is negative and that’s not our economy.
2480 2018-11-13 20:34:24 "Oil... can."
2481 2018-11-13 20:34:18 i don’t like this one dude
2482 2018-11-13 20:34:16 ey ey do you remember when you brought tickets at the turnstiles but you couldnt grab it because your brass hand was all slippery from the brass hand oil
2483 2018-11-13 20:34:14 CO2-wise? Yes, I prefer Middle East oil. It is unfortunate that the world's cheapest and cleanest oils are in politically problematic areas.
2484 2018-11-13 20:34:08 Aux USA ils sont exploités grâce à la finance au dollar roi dans les autres pays, ce sera moins flamboyant.
2485 2018-11-13 20:34:07 the follow on question for that thesis is is the now who is next in line next or is that all, similar to Feb VIX implosion. One dead body? Not likely in the oil space.
2486 2018-11-13 20:34:03 I am a huge $ bull, especially with oil in contango. Sets up for a big move ala 14-15.

but debt ceiling or more China stimulus (esp as their m1 collapses) could act as hurdles.

€ is also not stretched short. Not sure we’ve seen total capitulation from the bears

2490 2018-11-13 20:33:39 I'm a bit jealous of that, Mick, truth be told. I think they might have done the old nostalgia circuit for a while there, though not without cod liver oil and the odd rollator!!
2491 2018-11-13 20:33:31 “Hey use turkey bacon”

2492 2018-11-13 20:33:30 I hate oil leaks. 
2493 2018-11-13 20:33:28 Stop whining, Trump. Yeah, that's a joke...just like you are. The whole world laughs at Dishonest Don and the oil slick you call Son. Eric? He's just not smart enough to crack jokes about.
2494 2018-11-13 20:33:25 Back up your devices, get your oil changed, clean your room, double check your alarms, let your cars warm up, pack snacks and a charger. Mercury gonna be out here to show you that you need to get your shit together, so be ready for her.
2495 2018-11-13 20:33:25 so much for the rally toda, BA -2.5% continues to drag on the Dow -162, & AAPL -1% has slumped to its low point on the day thanks to crummy iPhone supplier earnings.  The 7% drop in crude could be another sign of China's weakening economy with OPEC cutting 2019 oil demand again
2496 2018-11-13 20:33:23 Almost had a stroke at the Subaru dealership when they hit me with that $100 oil change
2497 2018-11-13 20:33:21 @sainsburys @asda @Tesco @AldiUK @LidlUK @waitrose maybe you should all follow @IcelandFoods example and ban palm oil #PalmOilFree. @IcelandFoods may not be the biggest high street chain but they are the best after all it’s the lidle things. This Christmas give the gift of hope.
2498 2018-11-13 20:33:16 you ferment tea and it makes a layer of fungus that you can dry out and apply oil to in order to make what's basically tea leather and it's cool af
2499 2018-11-13 20:33:15 In a way the Trump team gave Iran quite a boost.
The renewed sanctions pushed up oil prices to $76, they upped their oil shipments to beat the Nov 5th deadline, and a massive depreciation meant they got more local currency for less oil
2500 2018-11-13 20:33:15 Never even knew what palm oil was before this ad either......

2507 2018-11-13 20:32:44 I wonder whether spaces access to sunlight, lack if access to oil and gas has an impact in this? LOVE the plan, but feel it's very contact specific and hard to easily apply to other countries

2511 2018-11-13 20:32:12 Ah yes. I can understand yr confusion. Unfortunately,those strong synthetic products are often petroleum based (oil) which is a limited resource &very ugly to access. Those products will also stay in dump sites, practically 4ever. Trees(& animals)when managed right are renewable

2516 2018-11-13 20:31:57 Either way I'm considering an add of oil here though

2522 2018-11-13 20:31:34 Given that price to get it to the pumps is about 55p I’d suggest that the 36p that the oil costs will see at best a 6p fall ... the rest is all government taxes! Given wholesale oil is bought months in advance we will be lucky to ever see more than a 2p fall in about a month!

2530 2018-11-13 20:30:36 I agree, and carbon taxes should help swing that profit point toward clean energy.  Green tech is in it for profit just as the oil companies are.  Oil and coal were probably equally righteous at the beginning - their products were revolutionary.  We need to win elections

2536 2018-11-13 20:30:07 I notice that shampoo and conditioner bars contain Sodium Lauryl Sulphate which I’m told is a dressed up word for Palm Oil.  Is this correct as I wouldn’t want to buy the product if it does contain #palmoil  Thank you
2537 2018-11-13 20:30:05 Allow me to register my disapproval at your disapproval lol
2538 2018-11-13 20:30:00 Just 2 weeks away from #EICConnect Oil & Gas! The PEI Team will be at Stand A13 to talk #EngineeredSolutions with you - @TheEICEnergy
2539 2018-11-13 20:29:53 I love it but it’s made with Palm Oil so I refuse to buy it.
2540 2018-11-13 20:29:51 Oil prices will never be permanently low, it’s a finite resource, supply and demand. And Scotland can easily survive without it. #DissolveTheUnion
2541 2018-11-13 20:29:35 Sometimes at work I gotta naruto run w the oil hose cuz it really does make it go faster but a customer saw me and now I feel dumb :/
2542 2018-11-13 20:29:25 Then we in Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles will claim independence and keep the oil.

You can go with your begging bowl to the EU
2543 2018-11-13 20:29:15 No like I just said in a previous response: One has to wonder at what point will AMZN be called a monopoly (like Standard Oil became) and be forced to break apart in some way?
2544 2018-11-13 20:29:14 I love it when most everyone in my stream is talking about #oil. I feel like a sniper at the shooting range.
2545 2018-11-13 20:29:09 I’m betting there’s going to be a private smack down coming...
2546 2018-11-13 20:29:09 At least tweeting's easier than talking ;)  I've never needed a filling (yet) and I really hate injections, but my bottom left wisdom broke up the tooth next to it  over three months at a time when there was no NHS dentist around ; I got through 4 bottles of oil of cloves ;-/
2547 2018-11-13 20:29:07 Exactly. Oil mining leases are sold to well funded production operators for this specific reason. If the Nigerian govt wanted to exclusively own all proceeds from the contents of its reserves, they should have mirrored Saudi Arabia. But can they ever think progressively?Never
2548 2018-11-13 20:29:06 Oil change
2549 2018-11-13 20:29:05 That's good  

Heating oil (kerosene) was 89 last week,  I'm due it,  so I'll try to hold off for a bit....
2550 2018-11-13 20:29:01 OIL MORE LOWS LOD
2551 2018-11-13 20:29:01 Salads are great but the dressings can be very high in calories &amp; fat. Choose olive oil &amp; lemon. Olive oil is a healthy Fat :)
2552 2018-11-13 20:28:47 @Poundland are your advent calendars, this year, full of chocolate made from palm oil? #conciousconsumer #rangtan #nopalmoilchristmas #checktheingredients what are you doing to stop the sale of all products containing palm oil. #2020toolate
2553 2018-11-13 20:28:47 It seems to me this is pretty good indication that the media are fascists who want to control every facet of minds and consciences. You can't *force* someone to feel bad about their actions. Of you could, there would be no need for laws.
2554 2018-11-13 20:28:47 Although it is his falt when it came to offering waivers, the US oil industry is pumping at historic levels and are driving themselves into a bust cycle. Like really guys? Adding 13 rigs after 7 weeks of builds?
2555 2018-11-13 20:28:45 That heating oil drop was this week it is actually down 4c per liter since this time last month.
2556 2018-11-13 20:28:42 $OILD my oil sort  is rocking if oil goes to the 40's and looks like the 30's could come fast tis goes to 100-150 from todays 34 im long from 27 last week
2557 2018-11-13 20:28:41 The £10bn deficit currently filled by the fiscal transfer! Which is nothing to do with what he’s writing about. Why are nationalists unable to think beyond oil?
2558 2018-11-13 20:28:38 Hence why we should be switching to electric cars! Oil is NOT clean energy!
2559 2018-11-13 20:28:28 I just put keratin oil in my hair this shit SOFT
2560 2018-11-13 20:28:28 Antifreeze in engine oil and windshield wiper reservoir too
2561 2018-11-13 20:28:25 oil n i were watching a documentary on the female orgasm & i mentioned that i need to buy a vibrator & oil went n ordered one for me () & it was supposed to arrive on sunday but it’s delayed & it was in brooklyn yday but is in NJ today??? does amazon not want me to orgasm?
2562 2018-11-13 20:28:24 This such a skewed campaign.  Messages aren't just black and white!  We need to act, but #nopalmoil is not the answer.  We need to switch to sustainable palm oil.
2563 2018-11-13 20:28:22 Almost a 10% decline in oil today alone! While cheaper gas prices is always good for the pocket book, this cannot be a good sign!
2564 2018-11-13 20:28:15 im bouta go get my oil changed yall want anything
2565 2018-11-13 20:28:11 I did see an add about people making pucks out of crude oil. Maybe that will save this country.
2566 2018-11-13 20:28:11 gonna start a cover band but the only song we play is Beds Are Burning by Midnight Oil
2567 2018-11-13 20:28:05 Oil was literally the only market priced asset that stuck purely to fundamentals of the real world during the QE craziness
2568 2018-11-13 20:27:59 Trump somehow thinks lower prices support the US oil industry. That Wharton degree being put to use.
2569 2018-11-13 20:27:59 Everytime I go to delta sonic for an oil change they always trying to make me add something extra. Like no 
2570 2018-11-13 20:27:52 I love flooring my car when I get an oil change
2571 2018-11-13 20:27:51  awesome! I take it when I'm really stressed but I take the terpenes CBD oil daily and it totally helps me throughout the day.
2572 2018-11-13 20:27:40 I wish my final assignment was an acrylic painting I'm pretty bad at oil and I'm not really comfortable with them.
2573 2018-11-13 20:27:36 and the Malabu oil scam
2574 2018-11-13 20:27:35 Why not rapeseed oil or something healthier ?
2575 2018-11-13 20:27:33 @oil_shaeikh I noticed earlier you were looking for caps, so I told this could help
2576 2018-11-13 20:27:33 How comes when oil prices rise there’s an immediate increase of prices at the pump (despite the stuff we’re pumping having been prepared in stock months ago) yet when they fall, it’s not reflected on forecourts ?
2577 2018-11-13 20:27:29 I'm. Bit confused. He knows about big cats but palm oil ??
2578 2018-11-13 20:27:23  I do now. 
He was been sarcastic. 
Hilarious.
2579 2018-11-13 20:27:23 It’s “oil slick” from the Yaya Han cosplay line!
2580 2018-11-13 20:27:13 @IkejaElectric Pls.this all night darkness is too much...why pay bills when you can't iron a godamn shirt at night when you get back from work.fix apata(somolu) light oo..we go home and come back to heat and darkness.whole place sounds and feels like a palm oil refining factory
2581 2018-11-13 20:27:10 So let's maybe not build uneconomic pipelines? And shift away from producing our really expensive and CO2 intensive oil?
2582 2018-11-13 20:27:07 They need oil that's all
2583 2018-11-13 20:26:59 no, letting it idle while it’s cold causes your car to use more gas which can strip oil from the walls in your car causing a shit ton of damage. i took a whole class on this and my dad, the owner of an auto repair company for 50+ years confirmed this before i even took the class
2584 2018-11-13 20:26:56 Of course groups working to ensure safer climate & environmental laws raise money from all over the world.  (So does oil & gas industry. Majority of shareholders Oilsands co’s not Canadian.)The rest of @fairquestions so called research is fear mongering and conjecture. #abpoli
2585 2018-11-13 20:26:55 The day you stop using oil, you can make incredibly daft comments like these. HYPOCRITE!!!
2586 2018-11-13 20:26:52 I just bought a cool new NEW 3DS The media lies! They’re all just a bunch of fruitless pies! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
2587 2018-11-13 20:26:52 Urgent vote to transform the #palmoil industry! RT to tell palm oil body @RSPOtweets to become credible & adopt ‘No #Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ policies in its new rules - and enforce them against @Indofood too!  #RT16 #RSPO
2588 2018-11-13 20:26:50 Palm oil is in every type of baking foodstuff right now.
2589 2018-11-13 20:26:35 If they don't cut production the oil price will drop, Texas drillers will have to stop, and you'll lose in '20 @realDonaldTrump @drfessel
2590 2018-11-13 20:26:34 Oil is the most fundamentally driven market that exists. If never deviates from fundamentals on an annual basis. The issue is it has to trade daily, but fundamentals come out monthly.
2591 2018-11-13 20:26:32 Zooming out on Oil charts been a hectic activity for a few weeks.
2592 2018-11-13 20:26:19 The last time $USO fell over 6.5% in a day was 2/1/16.  The next day it was down 5.25%.  But, previous 7 drops of over 6.5% led to gains the next day.  #stockstats #oil
2593 2018-11-13 20:26:17 The oil industry benefits many bands. Your generalization is not accurate.
2594 2018-11-13 20:26:17 As always, the answer is “it depends”. What was going on in the macro during the previous oil declines and how does it compare to today?
2595 2018-11-13 20:26:09 Add oil in there too
2596 2018-11-13 20:25:54 It makes it produce less oil overtime when you train it by skipping days between washes :)
2597 2018-11-13 20:25:46 hello i’m getting an oil change rn and i’m bored bc i’m just sitting here waiting
2598 2018-11-13 20:25:45 Crude Oil collapsing & Natural Gas setting new high, possibility to $4.90. Don't short Natural Gas as it has a very bullish chart-if long-stay long. Always average with your winnings and not against-your losses. Fundamentals are usually a after-fact. #Oil #Energy #NatGas #Crude
2599 2018-11-13 20:25:29 I love watching crude oil prices get crushed. Cheaper gas for me next month 
2600 2018-11-13 20:25:26 Save the #orangutans! For its NEW set of principles & criteria, I want global #palmoil body @RSPOtweets to vote for ‘No #Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ in palm oil, and to hold members like @Indofood to account #RT16 #RSPO
2601 2018-11-13 20:25:25 Yes, sorry, I forgot you're veg. Avocado oil is a good substitute because it has a higher smoke point. EVOO is generally not best for sauteeing.
2602 2018-11-13 20:25:15 Oil price down to 65 from 86 in one month! and oil prices here in Pakistan gone up 3-8 Rs!!  
Thugs ruling and looting masses!! 

#COAS #سلام_آخر #Crude
2603 2018-11-13 20:25:12 hm. using oil to replace butter is a neat cooking trick that is unfortunately definitely not intended for Kraft macaroni and cheese
2604 2018-11-13 20:25:07 Ask FB: Does anyone know of a substitute for Pachouli essential oil?
2605 2018-11-13 20:25:04 Oil plunges..  We have here, the largest fully developed Oil Field in The Country..Kern River Oil Field..Oil plunges to it's lowest in 2015.. Markets reacting..
2606 2018-11-13 20:25:03 Si, la baja del OIL va a ayudar
2607 2018-11-13 20:24:56 Your exactly right Paul, we need to get everybody together on this to put pressure on the UK government and the Oil Companies, as someone is making a lot of Money out of us !!
2608 2018-11-13 20:24:54 I’ll be amazed if the futures are not way off in the morning. A reall flush I think is coming. Oil does not fall like that without chaos ensuing...
2609 2018-11-13 20:24:54 the WILD action in energy
the high level of pessimism in the stock mkt
bonds trading higher but not as much as they should (oil crash is superbullish for bonds imho)
$GC smacked down yet again
$USD strenght

Xmast is closing in, prepare for the unthinkable
2610 2018-11-13 20:24:52 Heysel disaster? You mean the one where 12 Liverpool fans were rightfully punished for it with prison sentences? Tap up where Liverpool got a ban on signing youth players? Fair. Let's see the oil merchants get a fair punishment from UEFA, shall we?
2611 2018-11-13 20:24:52 Applegreen down 1c per liter in Celbridge others no change.
Heating oil down almost 2c per liter depending on supplier.
2612 2018-11-13 20:24:47 In Safety / Oil industry (NEBOSH, LEEA, ASNT II, Bosiet, ISPON, NSE, Coren, OSHA, Red Cross advanced First Aid, LMS, just to mention a few)
2613 2018-11-13 20:24:46 Lower price is good for industry/user, but bad for energy company and their equity. That will blow back. The best way is for US to produce more oil, but not ask OPEC to not cut. Otherwise, Trump will become target again.
2614 2018-11-13 20:24:45 Is this honestly even possible though. Like 100% green 
 x  x  %

Like no oil coal natural gas. Nothing burning whatsoever. 
Our country will be littered w/ windmills and solar panels from ocean to ocean. 
No wildlife will be impacted. Pretty much wont have vegetation
2615 2018-11-13 20:24:36 Except it will have the opposite effect. China will buy their oil with gold backed Yuan, Russia will protect their borders and the Petrodollar takes another hit. You'd almost think it was planned that way.
2616 2018-11-13 20:24:35 What kinda oil change yall be getting tho 
2617 2018-11-13 20:24:28 Lord Snooty on the rampage. Nanny’ll be needing to get out the castor oil.
2618 2018-11-13 20:24:24 Fake China news... this ridiculous narrative that somehow crashing OIL prices is good for stocks... traders drooling over "IHS setup"... "santa rally narrative... Take your pick!
2619 2018-11-13 20:24:20 What we saw today in the oil market was traders calling BS on OPEC jawboning. Either you are sticking with cuts or not, can’t have both worlds. #OOTT
2620 2018-11-13 20:24:20 @GovCaucus_NL I hope you are watching oil prices!!!! Down to $66 Brent today. Down $4 in two days! That is not a good harbinger for your recent readjustment.

2622 2018-11-13 20:24:17 Oil prices slided by 5 $/b today after President D.Trump tweets Opec not to cut output
2623 2018-11-13 20:24:17 Our taxes from the daily, weekly, monthly sweat of our brows have paid for Europe’s defense for 100 yrs & Macron fancies they need to be protected FROM US!??Not only that, we’re poised to keep Russ from lording it over them with his oil. What an immature, clueless twit is he?
2624 2018-11-13 20:24:11 Dude, it hasn’t worked with the old, white guys in Congress who suck the teat of big pharma, big oil, big insurance and anyone else who offers money.
I think the US is better off w/ Ocasio who didn’t take any PAC money.
2625 2018-11-13 20:24:09 Now do one with no cooking oil.
2626 2018-11-13 20:23:52 Canada needs distance from Trumpland.  Leave NATO, sell oil in Euros or Yen.

@realDonaldTrump  is dirty - he's a money laundering tax cheat.
2627 2018-11-13 20:23:47 @IAmAlphaM hi I’m 22. I use Softee coconut oil for my thinning hair. I have like 70% wavy and say 30% curly hair. What product should I use that has good hold and makes hair look shiny..AND DOESN’T SMELL BAD!
2628 2018-11-13 20:23:46 I could have sworn that someone told me if the dollar is down, oil goes up.
2629 2018-11-13 20:23:45 Usually there's a month of a lag when the barrel of oil falls in price but is fairly instantaneous when the barrel of oil increases......
2630 2018-11-13 20:23:39 Reading clearcast's justification[and in the light of the food industry's heavy dependence on palm oil with enviromental ramifications]it is plain to see the lawyers have split the atom on this one.
2631 2018-11-13 20:23:34  Before sleeping put vaseline/coconut oil on your lips especially if you sleep with your mouth open
I personally prefer coconut oil as it's really smooth

2633 2018-11-13 20:23:27 You will struggle to find zero deforestation Palm Oil
2634 2018-11-13 20:23:18 Good morning people of South Sudan. Today I have big plans to obtain a lot of oil  but have asked resident in the areas of extraction temporarily removed. Thanks.
2635 2018-11-13 20:23:11 On a year to year basis the price of oil has always reflected the fundamentals of supply/demand/inventories and I have charts to prove it. The daily and monthly moves are trading noise. The Dec 31 to Dec 31 price changes are fundamentals.
2636 2018-11-13 20:23:07 That’s what everyone always says  It’s a good recipe to impress those who don’t believe low carb can’t be delicious too! I have been doing mint chocolate ones recently too with some peppermint oil which are like After Eights! 
2637 2018-11-13 20:23:03 Yo. 

How can I start selling pics of my feet? Do I oil them up? 

I have a tattoo on one. Is that a plus?

How much are foot photos even worth? 

What if I take photos/videos while getting a pedicure?!

Ya gurl is struggling. Help me out!
2638 2018-11-13 20:23:00 Haaaaa! Oh, you’re serious? How about getting the US to stop fracking shale and the Saudis to stop dumping cheap oil to fight that?
2639 2018-11-13 20:22:58 Well u can use natural stuff like coconut oil, shae butter, or coca butter that works to
2640 2018-11-13 20:22:56 @jimcramer Has to be a hedge fund blow up for oil to tank that bad.
You agree?
2641 2018-11-13 20:22:53 I was just thinking about this also. It's normally oil following the market, but in this case, you'd think the market would care more.
2642 2018-11-13 20:22:49 Well you did have trouble understanding that doing something about the destructive nature of palm oil deforestation is better than doing nothing. Plus it's used to feed cows (meat) and only small % for vegans.
2643 2018-11-13 20:22:48 is…is that what you need the sesame oil for?
2644 2018-11-13 20:22:48 If the Oil inventory is high this afternoon. I think the market will capitulate tomorrow. We've seen it before.
2645 2018-11-13 20:22:38 You don't want our oil, gas, electricity, whisky etc?
Fair enough.
2646 2018-11-13 20:22:35 Right, don’t worry about why oil has fallen off a cliff. Just buy stocks because everyone will have more money to blow on shit they don’t need.  Seems legit
2647 2018-11-13 20:22:33 Oil prices should be much higher to figure in the damage to the environment... #FakePOTUS #ignorance #DonTheCon
2648 2018-11-13 20:22:30 I ain’t no oil painting but if there was me him and some female left on earth and we needed to reproduce to save the world,I would fancy my chances of getting lucky 
2649 2018-11-13 20:22:27 right? they still live in the fantasy world where EXXON and big oil was "The Man". yet, not realizing it's now big tech - Google/Apple/Facebook/Twitter/Yahoo, etc...
they ARE "The Man" now... #PaloAltoMafia #Twitler
2650 2018-11-13 20:22:24 $Amrn There are facts based on science while from the other side there are haters ( probably paid by BP) who  try to push the price down.  Don’t fall under hater’s trap. Focus on science and not the bullshit from the haters. The study and mineral oil was approved by FDA.

2653 2018-11-13 20:22:11 It’s now or never to save #orangutans: key #palmoil vote happening to urge global palm oil body @RSPOtweets to insist that members like @Indofood commit to ‘No #Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ #RT16 #RSPO
2654 2018-11-13 20:22:10 Use a little olive oil or avocado oil on your scalp 1-2x a week and that will help you not itch!
2655 2018-11-13 20:22:08 My plan is to blend aloe, oatmeal goo, and grape seed oil together and pour into a plastic glove. Then after I marinate a bit I'll wipe it off and apply Vaseline
2656 2018-11-13 20:22:05 Yep, read it, still think its a cop out. I'd rather 9 times of low yield on less biodiverse land to grow eg rape than palm oil grown in the most biodiverse regions with high no. endemics. Land sharing vs land sparing-can't share pristine rainforest.
2657 2018-11-13 20:22:03 Yeah, the house was apparently fighting back a bit, and then they had problems with several pumps not working to get the oil out of the old tank into the new one, and the poor bastards have been here since 8:30 and are still going.
2658 2018-11-13 20:22:00 Question: Do people not know
1) you should mop up an oil spill, whether inside or out?
2) small spills should be mopped up using clay kitty litter, and the soiled litter put in the garbage?
Jesus Christ, I am no grease-monkey bloke, but I've know this since I was a kid.
2659 2018-11-13 20:21:56 Intersectionality is such a great thing! They are going to eat their own
2660 2018-11-13 20:21:54 Is it already January???  Damn Libs can't wait to destroy our country even more than they already have! Sick.
2661 2018-11-13 20:21:46 I'm surprised #ES_F hasn't taken as much notice to #Oil today.
2662 2018-11-13 20:21:33 Under achievers ? A sweeping statement there young man . Still relying on North Sea oil ? If it wasn’t for little England as you so eloquently put it you my friend would be living in a country with less dosh than Venezuela
2663 2018-11-13 20:21:33 This is why there's opposition to further oil sands development. Yet you feature a conspiracy theorist 2 days in a row. #ClimateChangeIsReal
2664 2018-11-13 20:21:28 About 15 years. Started at 7 years old but wasn't that excited to learn to paint with oil/acrylic since the themes were assigned and not chosen by me. Around 17 I got serious about art and around 20 got into digital XD

2674 2018-11-13 20:20:52 Wrong. Who buys the oil? Individuals do. Who uses the electricity created by the burning of coal? We do. Yes, corporate entities are also to blame, but if they have no one to sell to then they cease to exist. No one is innocent.
2675 2018-11-13 20:20:46 I'm sorry but this oil collapse is not warranted one bit ! Brent falls 5 dollars in one day ! Just lunacy
2676 2018-11-13 20:20:38 . I've heard that "data is the new oil", but this is the best!
2677 2018-11-13 20:20:27 But if your car leaked oil, you could save your driveway.

2690 2018-11-13 20:19:37 my ICE is 20,000 miles or 2 years. Also my EV has reduction gearbox that needs oil replacing eventually.
2691 2018-11-13 20:19:36 Because the Empire vanished in a puff of smoke and all the goodies we were in the habit of looting became unavailable to us. The EU was a bit of a lifeline 45 years ago. You know, the 70s. Oil crisis? 3 day weeks. Petrol ration cards issued. Power cuts. Panic buying.

2706 2018-11-13 20:18:38 We hear you. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years.  We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.

2708 2018-11-13 20:18:36 Exactly. We've had the technology to make motor vehicles run on water for decades yet we're still depending on oil, fracking more than ever & building a spiraling web of leaking pipelines & oil rigs across our waters. This is America.

2712 2018-11-13 20:18:08 Would u care to mention a few???   Also the many many many more that have employees raises and hired many more people.  Not to forget the coal and oil industry.
2713 2018-11-13 20:18:02 Solution:
1. Acquire an air fryer (because a regular one uses too much oil), a bag of frozen breaded chicken wings, and a bottle of buffalo sauce
2. Cook up a batch at home
3. Eat wings on stream
4. ?????
5. PROFIT!!!

2716 2018-11-13 20:17:56 I did one interview today while waiting for my car's oil to be changed and another while waiting for my cat to get a blood draw at the vet. I'm feeling a little like a freelance superhero!
2717 2018-11-13 20:17:48 But given how oil puts have gone up this much with OVIX at 52+ now the downside risk is nearly 1% or lower right?
2718 2018-11-13 20:17:43 Crude oil down more than 4 1/2 bucks. Gas futures down a dime. Will your local station follow it lower as fast as they follow futures higher?
2719 2018-11-13 20:17:40 My gran from Cork married a man from NI, they had to elope to England to marry. Her Da was an IRA man, this was in the 1920s. He was protestant. I think its better that the UK splits. Watch England and Wales suffer without oil revenue from Scotland. You reap what you sow.

2722 2018-11-13 20:17:27 I heard it was oil of Nard, which has been thought to be Nardostachys Grandiflora, Himalayan Spikenard, the best Ayurvedic herb for mental disorders. Similar to Valerian but cooling and sharpening to the mind rather than heating and dulling.

White wine
1 litre chicken stock
Mushrooms 
Bunch of fresh asparagus 
Grated parmesan
2725 2018-11-13 20:17:17 IMO, the best way is to cut them in half, toss them in bacon grease and S&P, put them on a baking sheet flat side down, and roast at 400 for about 35 minutes. Saves the trouble of dealing with the low smoke point of olive oil.
2726 2018-11-13 20:17:12 Found in a 2009 report on shaping Alberta's economic future: "Alberta’s prosperity currently depends on the sale of energy to the U.S., and increasingly on oil sands as the source of that energy. The province is vulnerable as a result." Apparently we never get the message.

2746 2018-11-13 20:15:31 Pay attention to thi: Crude oil prices are in significant decline. OPEC predicting 2019 world oil demand will be 70,000 barrels a DAY less than projected. economy booming, but not so much elsewhere, and greedy investors taking it out on U.K. voter' decision to exit EU. 
2747 2018-11-13 20:15:31 When  the price of crude oil drops 7.5% in less than one trading day, you have a problem with your market not your investment.

2752 2018-11-13 20:15:08 Bonds are fine. They will follow oil with a lag. Bond mkt has had to absorb lots of supply lately & is also dealing with the Fed's shrinking appetite.That may change soon.

2762 2018-11-13 20:14:29 The problem with Palm Oil is Deforestation. Right? Animal Ag causes more deforestation, which leads to more species extinction (for Orangutans and many other animals), then Palm Oil does.
2763 2018-11-13 20:14:27 After other crashes in oil (down 7% after already being down 15% in the past month), the S&P 500 was higher over the next two weeks 16/18 times (one loss was -0.5%).

Since that time the GOP has been battling the democrats and science to ensure their big oil money keeps flowing. Blaming the democrats? Silly.

2804 2018-11-13 20:11:20 I worked there for 4 years. It’s hit and miss honestly. The friend food is good when the oil is new. The quesadillas and grill items are good when the cooks care. So it’s really 50/50.
2805 2018-11-13 20:11:17 Choices at the market read labels,palm oil don't buy,this will get companies
attention
2806 2018-11-13 20:11:11 $AMRN has $100m debt, it has to raise $300m if no big guy want to
Take it out. Fish oil is magic story
2807 2018-11-13 20:11:11 Is anyone fighting against the #PalmOil problem other than @Greenpeace?  I never see posts by anyone else about palm oil, yet it's one of the key factors driving the destruction of #Rainforests and the murder of indigenous people.

2810 2018-11-13 20:10:53 Go drink some Mineral Oil every day for the next few years, and see how you feel
2811 2018-11-13 20:10:52 wow .. Oil down to $65 from $80 (and from fears of it reaching $100) is a huge short-term relief for India, fx saved can be used to provide liquidity in the domestic mkts. To put it in perspective if oil stays at this level for 1 yr then the ~$15 billion saved = entire IL&FS debt
2812 2018-11-13 20:10:52 Uncertainty around mechanism of action and mineral oil jitters probably re-priced secondary from $20 to $15, $amrn
2813 2018-11-13 20:10:45 Waiting on this oil change is killing me
2814 2018-11-13 20:10:41 Strictly speaking, it was not allowed as advertising because it was produced by Greenpeace, who are a political lobby group rather than due to the content.
And palm oil is OK as a product if produced responsibly.

2817 2018-11-13 20:10:34 @MMFlint hi! im brian reaching out to  film makers the oil companies want to drill and frack under Rocky Flats. we dont think that is a good idea to drill and fracture the earth under the place that nuclear triggers were made. inclined to visit colorado and make a documentary? :)
2818 2018-11-13 20:10:29 Crude oil could fall to $54, lowest for the year

2820 2018-11-13 20:10:15 Bills must pass both the House & the Senate, then get signed by POTUS. Seems to me they should have been protesting outside the office of @SenMajLdr 
Pelosi already knows the future lies with renewables. 
Mitch McConnell & the GOP still support the coal & oil industries.

2837 2018-11-13 20:09:24 If oil keeps tanking, may not need more pipelines.
2838 2018-11-13 20:09:19 I don't believe it.  Lavazo was supposed to be a fab one as well and dr's won't prescribe it any more.  Vascepa was hyped years ago and this fake trial was the co's last hurrah.  Read the latest published data on fish oil and omega just from two days ago.

C-5 S-5 W-12. Sellers dominate as US $ strength pushes crude

2846 2018-11-13 20:08:55 Palmer’s Coconut Oil shampoo & conditioner & some random leave in conditioner I found in the house.  that’s my problem, I use anything I find
2847 2018-11-13 20:08:44 That ruined my trading year in 2014. I'll never doubt how long oil can stay oversold for again.
2848 2018-11-13 20:08:44 OIL GOING DOWN IS A GOOD THING!!! TIME TO BUY, BUY BUY!!!
2849 2018-11-13 20:08:42 However,  IEA still expects oil demand to grow despite EV's & USA must increase shale oil production by 10 million barrels a day by 2025. Don't forget decline rates in current shale oil production 
2850 2018-11-13 20:08:42 Learn some basic skills to take care of your home (carpentry, wiring, plumbing, painting etc.) and vehicle (change oil/filter, brakes, belts, rotate wheels etc.). You will know what to look for when you have to pay someone else to do it.
2851 2018-11-13 20:08:40 Like they meant lot of money in the treasury! @OfficialPDPNig looted away our money, also the crude oil price wasn't favorable as at the time this govt came to power. It's not the first thing they would do when the came to power my dear bro knowing the treasury was empty.
2852 2018-11-13 20:08:39 Good news for Thanksgiving drivers, bad news for #TheFrackers. Oil suffering worst day in three years, prices now down 15% just this month.
2853 2018-11-13 20:08:36 I just wondered if waiting a short while  to let the oil circulate,  then riding off, causes more engine wear than waiting for temp to rise to 50 or 60 degrees first.
2854 2018-11-13 20:08:33 I did not short Oil when Macro downgraded, only got out of $APC. I'm sitting here counting the money I didn't make.
2855 2018-11-13 20:08:32 I don't know MHQC personally, but believe from what I've seen here that he will do a good job. 

It will not be an instant fix though. Think of the CPS as an oil tanker, and you realise that a required change of course will take a bit longer than a hand brake turn in a Ferrari.
2856 2018-11-13 20:08:26 I want @RSPOtweets to vote to ensure palm oil companies adopt ‘No #Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ #palmoil policies. I can’t bear to see our #rainforests & precious #orangutan habitat destroyed #RSPO #RT16
2857 2018-11-13 20:08:22 All I want for Christmas is new tires, an oil change and @MichelleObama new book
2858 2018-11-13 20:08:22 She's a political opportunist with one goal in mind, to be one of the elite class. 
Nicholas Maduro was a bus driver.
2859 2018-11-13 20:08:18 there is too much noise in these markets.. meaningless noise.. no need to over analyse every swing.  just focus on the bigger things. dont overtrade. #ES #Brexit #GE #oil
2860 2018-11-13 20:08:18 The world will never get off oil.
2861 2018-11-13 20:08:09 I was thinking that I'm now due for an oil change, new filter and spark plugs.
2862 2018-11-13 20:08:01 Thank you. But which is worse: paying up for dollars or nearly giving oil away?
2863 2018-11-13 20:08:01 at those prices I don't see any downside to growing catnip and trying to make essential oil out of it

2867 2018-11-13 20:07:39 We need to stop with the retorect and get these pipelines built. It is good for Canada and good for the World.  Oil demand will be met from Canada or some other nation @SohiAmarjeet any updates you can share.

2870 2018-11-13 20:07:36 Plus, by the time we landed at Normandy, the Russians had already pushed the Nazis back to the boarder of Germany. Granted we helped supply them, but prior to that the German army had pushed deep into Russia and was going for the eastern oil fields.

2929 2018-11-13 20:04:46 We finally have a chance to transform the destructive #palmoil industry from within. Tell global palm oil body @RSPOtweets to vote to stop certifying companies like @Indofood that exploit people and land for cheap palm oil in its NEW principles #RSPO #RT16

2932 2018-11-13 20:04:39 Palm oil certification body @RSPOtweets will only be credible if its #palmoil growers like @Indofood eradicate exploitation, deforestation & destruction of ecologically precious peatland from plantations. They must use this weeks’ P&C vote well! #RT16 #RSPO
2933 2018-11-13 20:04:39 It does work, it's a question of how much it was helped along by placebo. And to answer your question they used mineral oil b/c they had to mimic the look of the Vascepa pill and mineral oil has that appearance.
2934 2018-11-13 20:04:37 Crude òil price continues to fall fall fall

Attributing to fall stock market..
2935 2018-11-13 20:04:34 @Chitown33  I am stuck holding.  Yes ESV will rise to $12 next year.  I never would have thought that oil would be down to $55...

2941 2018-11-13 20:04:27 I’ve been at this dealership for two hours trying to get an oil change and I’m about to get mad as fuck
2942 2018-11-13 20:04:24 Trump is dead set on destroying American industry at this point. Can't wait until the layoffs in oil and gas start showing up in monthly reports, and the drop in wages that will come with them. Perhaps he thinks we can import more low paid labor.

2947 2018-11-13 20:04:18 This market is completely delusional... Oil -8% $USO , Lumber -6%... Regional Banks $KRE who derive majority of their income from loans +1%... Will analysts continue to be as blind to the negative implications on forward earnings as they were surrounding $FB and the CA scandal?
2948 2018-11-13 20:04:14 Will #palmoil standards body @RSPOtweets ever champion real sustainability? This week its members vote on whether to clamp down on labour abusers like @Indofood who go on selling palm oil marked with its logo #RT16 #RSPO
2949 2018-11-13 20:04:09 I'm glad I'm out of equities. And crude oil!!
2950 2018-11-13 20:04:07 Palm oil is one of the reasons. The primary reason is animal agriculture.

2955 2018-11-13 20:03:47 I remember when I first brought up the fact that I thought I might be depressed at a doctors visit and my doctor told my mom to give me fish oil and make me take a yoga to “even put my moods” LOLOLOLOL 

2 years later I tried to kill myself
2956 2018-11-13 20:03:45 B.b.b.but I thought oil was going to $100+? LOL!!!!!! #oott
2957 2018-11-13 20:03:44 Higher interest rates are good for oil and gas exploration because of all the cash they have in deposits.  Lower oil prices mean people will use more gas.  Everyone wins

2959 2018-11-13 20:03:37 #DYK On this day in 1925, the Yount-Lee #Oil Company started a 2nd major #drilling boom at #Spindletop, #Texas, when the McFaddin No. 2 well began producing 5,000 bod. The well was completed just south of the famous “Lucas Gusher” of 1901. Via AOGHS
2960 2018-11-13 20:03:32 We need a list of producers who use sustainable palm oil. Be very useful.
2961 2018-11-13 20:03:28 The #orangutans could be extinct within a generation >> destructive #palmoil companies like @Indofood are to blame. RT to tell members of palm oil certification org @RSPOtweets to commit to ‘No #Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ #RT16 #RSPO
2962 2018-11-13 20:03:24 Any updates on #tmx or discussions on #energyeast. I haven’t seen any concrete updates from your team on how we are going to get our oil to market after Kxl holdup.

2968 2018-11-13 20:02:49 Two for Tuesday, both of these silver 996’s are in for service, one is in for an IMS bearing replacement and the other is in for an Oil Separator.
2969 2018-11-13 20:02:48 Alberta needs to diversify its economy beyond oil & gas. Getting an #Olympics provides a minor interim bump to the local economy at the expense of Canadian taxpayers. I'm for pumping $5Bn into economic diversification in Alberta, so long as we don't get Albertans to manage it.
2970 2018-11-13 20:02:43 The markets are no able to cope with such a loss in crude oil, the weight of the national debt. Weak Minds are used to all the cash without backing that when the crash comes most of them will not be able to cope. It was a mistake to trash can the gold standard.
2971 2018-11-13 20:02:31 Now I know this is a true lay weird day. Oil down 5%, brexit agreement and Lee saks criticises Trump.
2972 2018-11-13 20:02:27 Yesterday someone ate eba with palm oil..
2973 2018-11-13 20:02:26 Sesame oil has a string flavor but it makes sense with the other possible ingredients.  I like spice but I would imagine the fish needs an acid not pure heat.
2974 2018-11-13 20:02:23 Anyone know where I can buy a bucket of palm oil?
2975 2018-11-13 20:02:12 We have crossed the open 19 times today in the #es_f. Talk about noise!!!! It’s all about oil.
2976 2018-11-13 20:02:10 Lower oil the better.

2978 2018-11-13 20:02:02 Are perpetually low oil prices the most taken for granted benefit to the average American of the past five years?
2979 2018-11-13 20:01:59 I get oil wey dem use gry puff puff remain
2980 2018-11-13 20:01:46 $AMRN I see all these tweets,,, and defenders.. The drug does not work... it does nottttt work plain and simple.  Why mineral oil? Why not a sugar pill.  Independents will be doing their own studies watch and see and fail.
2981 2018-11-13 20:01:43 Just checking my food shop today @marksandspencer and so much of it contains Palm Oil! Why?? I won’t be buying again #doyourbit
2982 2018-11-13 20:01:39 I usually make incisions in the chicken and put bits of garlic. I cut a lemon in half and ram it into its ribcage and then I add onions and potatoes and mushrooms around, sprinkle some nutmeg, salt and olive oil on all, add white wine and a bit of paprika.
Tho I need to expand...
2983 2018-11-13 20:01:35 Hi Amy. All palm oil used in our own-label food products has come from sustainable RSPO-certified sources since 2015. This position is being extended to non-food products by the end of 2018. Thanks
2984 2018-11-13 20:01:33 Depends the car.. some need synthetic oil.. usually around $60 bucks.. older cars don't need that so it's a little cheaper
2985 2018-11-13 20:01:23 @hondaprojason hello, please can you advice why my 2006 Honda accord leaks engine oil often. I add 1 litre almost every two weeks
2986 2018-11-13 20:01:19 Why should potentially one of the largest oil producing nation in the world be refining abroad? @MBuhari We must NOT wait for Dangote. We should enjoy our natural resources. You can actually make it really cheap for Nigerians. Refine at home Mr President. @YemiOsinbajoVP
2987 2018-11-13 20:01:13 Tell ya bitch stop stealing my headscarves. They the ones that smell like backwoods and coconut oil bring it back

2999 2018-11-13 20:00:46 I’ve not found it too bad Doc. That said I’ve boxed off 30%  of my portfolio on a diverse market in NEX. Mainstream has been horrible and oil exploration this year has been horrible. Don’t know why people would fall out as it’s your money
3000 2018-11-13 20:00:42 So you’re saying that cap and trade is good enough? Cap and trade won’t even put a dent with how far gone we are. That would’ve worked in the 80s but definitely not now. We need a Green New Deal and take away subsidies from oil companies
3001 2018-11-13 20:00:41 If you’re putting a car away for the approaching winter, make sure you complete tasks when you take it out in spring. You’ll absolutely want to complete an oil change and check the battery.

3006 2018-11-13 20:00:37 Not sure... I thought they were just for oil heaters, I didn’t even know you could buy them. Thought you had to make them! I blame the magnificent Mrs Hinch x
3007 2018-11-13 20:00:37 I reckon perfect combo of slightly dampnroad, muddy tyres and maybe some oil.  Wasn’t going fast. Wasn’t turning a corner. Bike just went when I braked.
3008 2018-11-13 20:00:36 It's an Asian dish, olive oil as a flavor just doesn't work. Use macadamia nut oil or sesame oil. I'd only use Sriracha if I were trying to cover the flavor of not so fresh fish; it's too strong a flavor.
3009 2018-11-13 20:00:31 Crude oil down almost 5 
3010 2018-11-13 20:00:30 Daily Price Estimate - as at 13 November:  Petrol DOWN +/- R1.48 per litre, Diesel DOWN 84 cents - at the pump in December  (R/$ 14.38, Oil $70.12)

3014 2018-11-13 20:00:22 Nice call on oil on Sunday!

3023 2018-11-13 19:59:46 Yes, he did. And a new bubble for the tank gun sight. And told to oil the track-pins to stop them squeaking. And asked how many anti-clockwise rotations of the turret he'd performed, as it was liable to fall off its thread if fully unscrewed!#weneedatankemoji
3024 2018-11-13 19:59:38 Mixing 2 kinds of leaves with read oil and crayfish can't compare to the mastery behind a pot of Ndole. Periodt!!!
3025 2018-11-13 19:59:36 We are not by any means using the bare minimum as you say, if that were true the oil companies would even turn a profit
3026 2018-11-13 19:59:31 What ingredient is the alternative to palm oil.
3027 2018-11-13 19:59:18 True under capitalism capitalist try to maximise profit wich has shown to have some nasty sideeffects like climatechange. Corporations fight progress a lot of the time, because it would make (one off) their busnisses obsolete. Just look at coal, oil, private prison etc
3028 2018-11-13 19:59:15 Rather get 100ml of jojoba or sweet almond or grapeseed oil use 1 lemon. Those don't clog pores
3029 2018-11-13 19:59:13 Coyotes. Young pups like to chew them. I think I’ve read somewhere that there is an oil in the rope which is plant or animal based. Stakes as well. Clean cuts due to sharp young teeth.
3030 2018-11-13 19:59:09 ...breakouts now which I just use a gentle cleanser and coconut oil as moisturizer for now. Sometimes acne is just TOO tough and everyone is different. Twas a bit expensive even with insurance but worth it to not cry when I looked in the mirror, get my skin back!
3031 2018-11-13 19:58:37 Near 30% crash in oil in just over a month.  Insane.

3033 2018-11-13 19:58:29 Farming livestock is maintaining species not wiping them out. Palm oil plantations are wiping out multiple species  including our close relatives orangutans.
3034 2018-11-13 19:58:29 Globalization is definitely important for resource depleted areas, but also bad for resource rich areas (see Middle East)... we need oil drilling, fracking or lithium strip-mining to import cheap shit from China... that’s “bad globalization”.
3035 2018-11-13 19:58:19 Yield curve spread has narrowed 10 bps  from beginning of October, eurozone in serious trouble, and crude oil in free fall.

Troubling developments for #economy.

3041 2018-11-13 19:57:43 Saudi Arabia promise to decrease oil production to stabilize the oil market. Why do I feel like they are doing it to atone for something? Say... a recent heinous crime?
3042 2018-11-13 19:57:39 MARKET REPORT : huge FALLDOWN on CRUDE OIL, WTI has lost almost 4 USD within just 6 hours, the actual price is 55.40 USD per barrel, expect more BEARS.
3043 2018-11-13 19:57:38 No worries. You can eat anything but if u follow the plan i shared. Rice,oil and flour are nt to be used. Olive oil yes... Losing weight is not a rocket science. Its simple if technically coped with. Not to work on abs using balls and mats,not to run on treadmill. inclined walk.
3044 2018-11-13 19:57:34 Take a trip to the coast to get a fix! Best squid ink dish I’ve had was in San Remo... though I’ve never been to Italy south of Rome. I believe Liguria still qualifies as sufficiently Mediterranean. Let’s say the northern “olive oil” border.
3045 2018-11-13 19:57:29 what's left to say, really? have you noticed oil is down slightly today?

There is no more time left for “Pragmatic Bipartisan Solutions” on either front. In 10yrs, this planet is going to be a hellscape if we don’t yank out the oil needle now.
3049 2018-11-13 19:57:12 Well that’s what I thought with NAP five year average contracts in the VLCC sector and 5 yr. ave. Long term rates around $38k....GAWD did that get throttled....this should be substantively different....likely just sympathy sell off with oil
3050 2018-11-13 19:57:10  only we would choose to keep drilling expensive and precious oil instead of developing inexpensive, renewable energy (which also would help us be globally competitive) 
3051 2018-11-13 19:57:08 Oil is going lower because no one uses it anymore

3054 2018-11-13 19:56:49 Twitter all over crude oil, so I bought some. Don't really care if it goes lower, can buy more tomorrow but got a time stop on it of 3 days.
3055 2018-11-13 19:56:46 What a sell in oil!
3056 2018-11-13 19:56:41 Anchovies, olives (preferably green), mozzarella and a sprinkle of parmigiano and basil. Or sundried tomatoes and goat's cheese. Or artichokes in oil and black olive tapenade.
3057 2018-11-13 19:56:33 this massager that the Chiropractor gave me to use on patients looks similar to my boo’s dick and I don’t feel comfortable holding it or putting oil on it, my mind is WAY too perverted for that and all I can think about is what a goos size this is  nope I’ll use my hands!
3058 2018-11-13 19:56:23 Oil stocks gonna take a spanking, and there is me buying GKP today DOH !
3059 2018-11-13 19:56:22 I mean, America's been starting pointless wars since John Adams attacked the french bc he didn't want to pay them back. I guess it wasn't technically about oil though so you're right.

3061 2018-11-13 19:56:16 Don't look at day to day (or even near term) fluctuations. Every new EV on road is a nail in the oil coffin. Next year expect quarter million EVs on road. Going forward it will only increase. 5% reduction in demand is enough to cut oil price by 30% or more.
3062 2018-11-13 19:56:11 name a major economy that can afford $65 oil ..Japan? maybe

$WTIC fundamentals
3063 2018-11-13 19:56:10 Remember when the crowd were shouting ‘oil to reach $100’
Those were the days
3064 2018-11-13 19:56:08 last night i took hemp oil my mom gave me for anxiety thinking the effects would be gradual..... my body was slump, i immediately went to bed, slept 10+ hrs, had vivid ass CRAZY ass dreams, w zero psychoactive effects other than crazy dreams. honestly it was GREAT ?  fuck smoking
3065 2018-11-13 19:56:08 Ke cooking oil sandshem 
3066 2018-11-13 19:56:05 Con Oil -7% mañana salen todas petroleras a anunciar una baja en combustibles? Deberían no, cuando lo subieron era porque se había ido a u$s75...bajarán?
3067 2018-11-13 19:56:05 My dad always texting me back "ok." lol shit gets on my nerves.
I can ask for a band or ask him to get me an oil change, and this nigga will give me the same exact reponse every time.
3068 2018-11-13 19:56:03 @LOCCITANE_UK is the palm oil used in your products from a certified sustainable source?
3069 2018-11-13 19:56:00 So API is not officially a lobbying organization, but it spends money on lobbyists to lobby for pro oil and gas policies
3070 2018-11-13 19:55:57 Just because you create content doesn't mean you know what fps is  you clearly don't based on all of these responses. That's like saying I know how to change my car's oil because I drive a car. And it's "there". Come on dude, educate yourself
3071 2018-11-13 19:55:44 The press in America is specifically engineered to benefit the people who own it, the same people who are also invested in energy, electricity, war, and oil. #RupertMurdoch is a perfect example. Their job is to divide everyone by 2. Not 3. Not 4. By two. Red or Blue.
3072 2018-11-13 19:55:42 I use fructis frizz defy oil & it works the same it’s just not as heavy. I can’t use castor oil bc I wear my hair in wraps constantly
3073 2018-11-13 19:55:32 LOL, #iran is independent? Can't even sell its own oil without begging Russia, China and EU. Can't even collect its own oil $ and the money collected goes to foreign terrorists/regimes, not iranian ppl

Only an Islamist calls basic rights like music and fashion "material goods"

3075 2018-11-13 19:55:31 SO happy to announce I’ll be working with CBD oil, a good first step into what I love 
3076 2018-11-13 19:55:20 You're the guys protecting private property from us reds. Prager U has millions from the oil industry and they pollute the airwaves with "cultural marxism" 

It's the biggest case of "NO U" to distract fash from their own glaring faults and hypocrisies
3077 2018-11-13 19:55:15 Oil was $100+ in 2014 w/ yields nearly the same as now. They fell together into mid 2016 then rose together at diff pace. Rates are moving on factors o/s of oil. A tuggle war between bulls/bears on change in economy & CB support. It gets settled somewhere. Mass confusion until
3078 2018-11-13 19:55:14 Please change your vendor of oil. The orangs are dying. Let us know if you need any other information, or want to give out excuses.
3079 2018-11-13 19:55:04 Any chance we will se inventories draw this week finally? If not more downward pressure on the oil price.....

3081 2018-11-13 19:54:56 Bruh they funded the fuckin Khmer Rouge, they fund shit all over the world for no reason all the time if they think they can get some instability going and profit from some oil. They think they can access syrian oil by funding them bcs they're separate from the nationalist Syria.

3085 2018-11-13 19:54:41 Ouch. Yeah that is filter changes too but it won’t be being done there, they can’t justify that charge for a pollen filter and oil change IMHO.

3087 2018-11-13 19:54:35 U.S. oil prices end at lowest in nearly a year, down 12 straight sessions
3088 2018-11-13 19:54:32 THIS!  Holy balls haha. The oil is super concentrated! I’m sorry you had to deal with that but I hope everything is okay!  They must have tripped and fell into another universe and freaked out!
3089 2018-11-13 19:54:28 What Iceland don't mention is that the replacement they use for palm oil is worse for the environment - it requires five times the land for the same amount of oil. They should be looking at properly managed palm oil sourced.
3090 2018-11-13 19:54:27 Hi @IcelandFoods are your ‘no bull’ vegan ranges palm oil free too? Thanks!
3091 2018-11-13 19:54:24 Wtf ! Is the deal w/the keystone  pipeline ? We need it so we’re not dependent on foreign oil !!!
3092 2018-11-13 19:54:21 Thank you for posting.  Oil companies always practice oil spill response.  The public just isn’t aware of it.
3093 2018-11-13 19:54:20 This is miss wrong side mind....we as Malaysia as manage ours resource as well even though we deforestation for planted oil palm that could help produce oxygen ...we are also have "reserved forest of malaysia" that could help this animal life with ruin their lives nature. TQ
3094 2018-11-13 19:54:19 "Iceland removed all brands containing palm oil in store and they went bankrupt do you think we should do anything about palm oil?" 

What do you think the answer would be for other supermarket bosses.
3095 2018-11-13 19:54:12 Tea tree oil go on beards?
3096 2018-11-13 19:54:11 What is the message of crude oil market? this free fall can't only be due to supply concerns. Are we missing something?@_anujsinghal @latha_venkatesh

3101 2018-11-13 19:53:59 Hey Powell! are you watching Oil!?
3102 2018-11-13 19:53:59 Problem: Butter is expensive.
Solution: Add oil and call it butter.
3103 2018-11-13 19:53:56 my car needs a tune up and oil change ugh life is hard
3104 2018-11-13 19:53:56 Lmao abeg 
3105 2018-11-13 19:53:22 a thumb-twiddling committee of legislators owned by big oil aren't gonna do jack squat to reveese climate change; AT LEAST @Ocasio2018 recognizes the urgency
3106 2018-11-13 19:53:20 How can you raise a brilliant point about Iceland and palm oil in the morning... 

and then come out with this
3107 2018-11-13 19:53:15 The last piece of the oil short is +140% now with a 10/03/18 entry at $4.73 in $DWT!! I sold almost all of it in this crash. Rolled the money into pretty serious #Cannasector #Cannavestor #MJ #MMJ vertical integration strategy for the US. Sessions gone is a game changer. #Center
3108 2018-11-13 19:53:01 If your point is "there are more variables than fit into a single bivariate choropleth" then I agree. Anyone who sells you a simple picture of race in America (one way or the other) is peddling snake oil (probably even to themselves).
3109 2018-11-13 19:52:53 OIL MONEY!
3110 2018-11-13 19:52:52 Anyways,easiest way to get the zest is to not peel the lemon but grate it whole until you reach the second flesh layer ewhite

Don't forget to use sunscreen lemon burns,don't use it on your face coconut oil clog pores. If you must use jojoba or almond oil to make lemon oil
3111 2018-11-13 19:52:52 1 ounce rye
1 ounce Cognac
1/2 ounce Benedictine
1/4 ounce Fernet Branca
1/4 ounce demerara syrup

Strain over ice in a rocks glass. Squeeze the oil from an orange oval over the top, rub the peel on the rim of the glass and drop it in. #BitterYak
3112 2018-11-13 19:52:50 If you're going to break up Comcast to own the libs, let it be known we also love oil companies and big banks, and would really really hate it if you got rid of those. Thanks.

3115 2018-11-13 19:52:34 At times it is fair to say that we deserve what's coming our way because we vote snake oil salesmen. Religion and politics hv reduced us to dunderhead status. We seem immune to thinking
3116 2018-11-13 19:52:30 Hey @MazdaUSA why do I have to watch @CNN at the dealership. I don’t need this negativity in my life. Along with my 90 minute oil change...which also doesn’t make any sense 
3117 2018-11-13 19:52:27 Oye SINVERGÜENZA, eras el chupe del prófugo "Choro Sagrado" Toledo, borracho y coquero, aliado del otro corrupto PPK, que coimeo USD 20 millones y más con Odebrecht y Hunt Oil, y tienes la CONCHA de hablar? La lógica es que te metas la lengua ya sabes donde y desaparezcas.
3118 2018-11-13 19:52:26 This is your reminder to stay away from coconut oil today.
3119 2018-11-13 19:52:23 Is it time for #OPEC to cut production to get oil back up off the lows? I'm asking for a friend. TY
3120 2018-11-13 19:52:22 It’s so u healthy to wash your hair every day. Your call produces oil for a reason and shampoo just strips your hair of its natural oils.
3121 2018-11-13 19:52:04 Aveeno and argan oil saved my skin. Thank God!

3125 2018-11-13 19:51:53 I am told that the oil px rally was bearish for NG due to big bi-product supply from pulling up shale oil to meet higher px's. This collapse in oil must be way bullish for natural gas now, esp w/ cold forecast. #oil #naturalgas #Commodities #Crudeoil
3126 2018-11-13 19:51:43 OMG @jimcramer Oil falling like a rock, is a slowdown/recession coming or something?
3127 2018-11-13 19:51:43 No. I am looking at the big picture. The rise of Islamic terrorism owes a lot to oil money. The world is moving away from oil based transport to electricity based transport. It is a world changing event. India cannot rise by depending on ME-oil
3128 2018-11-13 19:51:43 Could care less about oil prices.  STOP SELLING JETS TO THE COUNTRY THAT FINANCED 911 HIJACKINGS!!!!

3132 2018-11-13 19:51:40 Look at all the traders who were expecting Oil to rally yesterday and today.
3133 2018-11-13 19:51:38 Mr Pompeo is there any shame or not? After the first Gulf War [1991] your then Govt applied sanctions on Iraq and U.S companies colluding with Saddam sold Iraqi oil. The American sanctions killed hundreds and thousands of Iraqis including children but kept Saddam in power.
3134 2018-11-13 19:51:37 So true. Shale caps oil below $80 and OPEC floors it at $60 
3135 2018-11-13 19:51:37 Obviously Rick Scott is afraid of her. 
Weak performance on  @FoxNewsSunday 
Absolutely no direct response to why she wasn't removed already. Talking points and diversion
3136 2018-11-13 19:51:37 Don't they want our oil? Can't those who push this line think realistically.
3137 2018-11-13 19:51:35 @hasanminhaj @patriotact your amazing, you approach to telling the hard truth mixed with comedy is on another level. The oil episode was particularly enlightening for me, because I'm watching for the moment the US tries to embargo Iran and Iran blocks the Strait of Hormuz.
3138 2018-11-13 19:51:33 Oil down 7%, we need more $Tesla @elonmusk
3139 2018-11-13 19:51:30 Oil selling international sovereign debt paid back dollars gets real expensive for national governments. Strong dollar affects EM debt too
3140 2018-11-13 19:51:30 Thank you for solving the energy crisis by making oil practically free @realDonaldTrump
3141 2018-11-13 19:51:26 I use my spritz (water+olive oil+leave-in) in the morning, shake and I am good to go.
3142 2018-11-13 19:51:12 being BASICLY debt free WE SHOULD be able to sell oil at all most any amount and still PROFIT ! THEN add natty gas and liquid gas

3151 2018-11-13 19:50:52 INSIDE STORY: the story I’d most like to read about the oil market in 2018 is about the evolving private discussions between the United States and Saudi Arabia over sanctions on Iran
3152 2018-11-13 19:50:48 @OilGasCanada there are reports that this oil isn't even going to use in the US it's for private export. This doesn't benefit our people or lands. Stop destroying our lives for your profit!
3153 2018-11-13 19:50:47 Oil now down 30% from October high. Many companies that make "things" have been complaining about rising energy, input and freight costs. I wonder if oil's drop ameliorates some of the pain going forward.
3154 2018-11-13 19:50:29 No it doesn't. We still rely on OPEC. They control the price of oil. OPEC is a group of countries and we can't compete. Gas is 3.50 a gallon here, almost 4.00 for the premium I have to buy.

3159 2018-11-13 19:50:10 For Hanukkah, popular foods include anything cooked in oil, to commemorate the eight-day-burning light at the center of the holiday. For the same reason, some people eat goose, for all the fat. All-occasion treats such as challah and kugel might also be served. #APStyleChat
3160 2018-11-13 19:50:04 Oil is getting murdered.  Good for those who drive, bad for the ginormous section of our economy who tries to profit from it.
3161 2018-11-13 19:50:03 If we want the planet to remain habitable we have to greatly reduce if not eliminate the use of fossil fuels, so how does any new pipeline possibly pass environmental review? They can't. Obama should have made this argument, but he sold us out to the bankers, who own oil/gas.

3164 2018-11-13 19:49:55 #Crude #oil $WTI has reached a new 2018 low. It looks fairly ugly as the bears made heavy damage reversing the prior yearly gains in about 6 weeks.
3165 2018-11-13 19:49:54 The shit that be pissin me off is Africa got enough natural resources for everybody on the continent to live like mfs in Dubai. Africa been gettin its resources stripped for CENTURIES & they still at it! Metals, stones, lumber, chocolate, oil.. smfh. Trillion$ man

3168 2018-11-13 19:49:43 Crude Oil down 7% following OPEC report
3169 2018-11-13 19:49:42 Oh, I didn't know people in China, India, and Africa were reducing their need for energy from oil...

Europe does not consist "the rest of the world".  They are neither better nor worse than us, just different.

3176 2018-11-13 19:49:18 You know very well that easily oxidized vegetable oils like canola and soy oil are some of the worst oils you can use. Or don't you know that yet...the science is in on oils and your veg oils are the very WORST...not stable saturated fats.

3184 2018-11-13 19:48:44 Harper pushes through authority to proceed without consulting 1st Nation nor proper environment assessment. The Liberals has to step up when the Corporations ran away. Oil needs to move
3185 2018-11-13 19:48:40 Can’t even begin to match that, but in a conversation with a friend who designs horizontal drilling tools for the oil industry - me: “how is work?” [i pause for enormous effect, and before he has a chance to respond] “a little bit up and down?”

3192 2018-11-13 19:48:22 Follow the money. US pulled itself out of the great depression due to war time economy. US military has been the cornerstone of our economy ever since. Also the largest purchaser of oil in the world

3199 2018-11-13 19:47:59 Indeed, with enormous amounts of cash thats covered in oil & natural gas.  Not too nitpick, but you mentioned he spent $50 million to address his fullback situation when it was over $130 million.
3200 2018-11-13 19:47:59 I have no idea, I was told oil moves on supply & demand
3201 2018-11-13 19:47:59 We don’t rely on foreign oil anymore because we sell our natural gas.  Which gives us the leverage and equity to tell the Saudi’s that we won’t fight for them anymore.
3202 2018-11-13 19:47:50 The last time I straight my hair, I put lots and lots of black castor oil on it while it was wet and then blow dried it. It was so heavy and greasy but I wasn’t wearing it out so I didn’t care.

Oil needs a true collapse to wipe out weak players.
3205 2018-11-13 19:47:47 Dennis Gartman had the best public call on short crude oil at the The Investment Institute in Chapel Hill I’ve ever witnessed. We should have all run out of the room and sold short crude. As well as everything else.
3206 2018-11-13 19:47:46 Oil down down down losing another 6% today after a (long) string of losses. $UNG opposite. Entering a $USO swing long $11.74 and lower

3208 2018-11-13 19:47:35 .@patriotact respect what you're doing with this show. Thanks for your episode on the US oil industry, minus the use of Fox News alongside reputable fact sources like CNBC and Pacific Standard- what's that about?

3213 2018-11-13 19:47:12 We actually have refineries on the east coast. Unfortunately, Quebec and the feds killed the pipeline that could deliver it. With no pipeline taking cheap ethical Canadian oil east, there is no way the refinery will re-tool itself off the unethical blood oil from Saudi Arabia.

3215 2018-11-13 19:47:05 That's the key reason that CNY oil was a game changer.  Many oil market observers were so busy laughing at CNY oil, they missed the true point: If it worked at all, US financing issues (which were already pressing) would get much worse, much faster.  Check to you, Fed.

3224 2018-11-13 19:46:26 "We" don't build refineries. Very large oil companies do but will not risk the $20 billion unless all aspects are guaranteed.  Unfortunately little Justin is too unstable and inexperienced to pull this off.

3237 2018-11-13 19:45:34 Not so much the kerosene scent but the "dirty sock" smell from engine oil seal leak is what is really bad. Fume events do seem to happen more on the A319-A321. And yes, the ones using the IAE2500 engines seem to stand out more than the CFM engines which US Air used on their A321s

3240 2018-11-13 19:45:12 I have to think the lack of movement in $CAD today given oil’s collapse means its already priced the near worthless Western Canadian Select price, and clinging to the hopes of more BoC rate hikes in 2019. Hmmmmm...
3241 2018-11-13 19:45:09 the folks long oil now were counting on #OPEC to help.

3256 2018-11-13 19:44:09 You grate 2-3 lemon skins/zest and soak in half a cup of oil. Could be olive or coconut for a week or 2 then you remove the skin from the oil. Coconut oil will give you yellow/greenish hue. Olive is tricky cos it's already yellowish. Store in a glass mason jar from pep

3280 2018-11-13 19:41:52 Fascinatingly, if CNY oil was ramping up its importance, one potential effect would be...(wait for it)...a collapse in oil prices that does not drive a coincident collapse in 10y UST ylds.  Success of CNY oil = increased US fiscal pressure, rapidly.

3287 2018-11-13 19:41:27 The Democratic party was taking money from oil companies, then decided to stop, then started again. Why? Look at what's happening in California. We need our leaders to be serious about the issue, not take money from the people who are the main cause.

3308 2018-11-13 19:40:00 The scary part is what happens to oil and the US markets when they realize there is no trade deal coming? Been saying this is a good time to BTD in the energy sector, but looks like Trump has destroyed the market and this could get worse. Gold has also done nothing as a hedge.
3309 2018-11-13 19:39:59 Last year you assured us the palm oil in these was from a sustainable source. Is that true this year @asda ? Unfortunately, though palm-free, @IcelandFoods #MincePies contain milk so aren't vegan. 
3310 2018-11-13 19:39:59 Cutting restrictions so we are for the first time in decades not dependent on middle eastern oil. Moving the embassy to Jerusalem. Defeating Islamic state. I could go on if you’d like?
3311 2018-11-13 19:39:58 I’m sure you can place a call to your and Kushner’s buddy over there (the murderer you refuse to call out), but the smarter move would be to end the policies to wean everyone off of oil which is killing the planet, you know, that thing we all live on?

3314 2018-11-13 19:39:44 Oil plummets yet again in trading today. Barrel of oil here in the states trading at $55.69 at close. This is good news for American consumers with holiday shopping season right around the corner.
3315 2018-11-13 19:39:40 Water, man, water & oil to produce water.

The 2 resources more expensive and less appreciated by WHITE RICH PEOPLE who play golf.

3321 2018-11-13 19:39:10 Low oil = Cheaper gas = More sideline money = BTFD
3322 2018-11-13 19:39:06 oil just can't stop , does that market close at some poin?
3323 2018-11-13 19:39:06 Ropa vypadá,že pod 56 USD je kapitulace. Nakupuji po delší době černé zlato! 
Dějí se to v listopadu věci, jako by elektro vozítko měl každej v garáži, to ale ještě dlouho nebude ! 
#oil #long
3324 2018-11-13 19:39:04 Thx for thots. Higher oil helped lift rates out of its lowflation narrative so that’s why I picked that time period. If you have sophisticated corrrelation model, energy has been the top driver of yields for past 1.5 years. Therefore, this is significant.
3325 2018-11-13 19:39:01 Everyone can be vegan, it's down to personal choice. But frankly I find it hilarious that carnists are jumping on the palm oil crusade.... #facepalm #Vegan
3326 2018-11-13 19:39:00 Crazy thing about oil is that despite this slide price is going to at least double next year. Hope y’all enjoy low gas prices while they last.
3327 2018-11-13 19:39:00 I smell something like tangerines and coconut oil. but I'm in Dallas at a electronics store. 
3328 2018-11-13 19:38:55 Oil On Track To Extend Losing Streak To Record 12 Sessions
3329 2018-11-13 19:38:41 Crude Oil has been taking quite a hammering today and Brent Crude is off over 6% at below US $66. If it stays there it will provide a perspective to tomorrow's UK inflation data especially PPI
3330 2018-11-13 19:38:41 There were days I've eaten worse, pasta, rice, greasy meat and I never gained. This week I've been doing good and healthy, no fat, only a some package foods that may have some artificials. But besides that nothing else and I'm stressing because the eggs had a little oil lmao
3331 2018-11-13 19:38:36 Guys I finally got an oil change
3332 2018-11-13 19:38:28 Vas pea showed a difference though the curves didn’t start to separate until a year. And, is mineral oil toxic?? Serious question as CRP rose in control group. Begs the question of natural rise in CRP in the same population.  I don’t know the answer.
3333 2018-11-13 19:38:19 I'm still very young sir. 
3334 2018-11-13 19:38:15 There's nothing like a fence post up 'yer arse to make you move.
3335 2018-11-13 19:38:09 The margin calls, they are a-rollin' in. #Oil #WTIC
3336 2018-11-13 19:38:06 Can’t wait till people get bored of palm oil then get everyone to sign a petition to ban something else daft
3337 2018-11-13 19:37:59 also we can preach about recycling and banning straws all we want, but until we start holding corporations and the oil industry accountable and move forward w legislation against them then we’re fighting for a lost cause
3338 2018-11-13 19:37:52 Hi @mrjakehumphrey are you going to stop buying these products for you kids now u know what these Company’s are doing, As this is what u said the other day?”And it’s so simple. Just check labels before you buy & if you see the words Palm Oil...put it back on the shelf ”
3339 2018-11-13 19:37:41 To be clear, I never implied what the US cares about except for getting oil prices lower. Although it could be true that the US does not care about #Khashoggi or #Yemen, it gives them more levers to pull. More leverage over Saudi. What the US tells them to do, they better listen

3342 2018-11-13 19:37:32 So free oil then?  $USO /QM   Almost nibbled some there then reminded myself how comforting it is to spectate for a day.
3343 2018-11-13 19:37:24 I hate to say this,
But oil is down 7% today!
3344 2018-11-13 19:37:23 palm oil is so widely use I have literal nightmares about it
3345 2018-11-13 19:37:19 Simple. stop providing welfare to big oil.
3346 2018-11-13 19:37:19 I want @RSPOtweets to vote to ensure palm oil companies adopt ‘No #Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ #palmoil policies. I can’t bear to see our #rainforests & precious #orangutan habitat destroyed #RSPO #RT16
3347 2018-11-13 19:37:15 this guy was really drunk and came home to his girlfriend (she never likes anal) but he was talking about how he couldn’t help himself and basically force fucked her. he said that he rammed his entire dick in her ass all at once with no oil... the details were disturbing as hell
3348 2018-11-13 19:37:14 The price of oil is crashing, down almost 7% today. Yay!
3349 2018-11-13 19:37:07 You started all this uncertainty. You sold people snake oil, with no receipt, then done one. You’re an absolute fraud. You’ll survive post Brexit, dining out on how worse off we are because nobody listened to you. The sad thing is, people will still believe your lies.
3350 2018-11-13 19:37:03 Yeahhh I represent physicians. That picture made me anxious. I’ve seen plenty of medical licenses disciplined for “unprofessional conduct.” That guy likely has a complaint coming.
3351 2018-11-13 19:36:58 will high nat gas offset low oil? 
sincerely, cold in illinois
3352 2018-11-13 19:36:58 Anyone around do Oil Furnace repair? (Looking for the Deer Lake Legion)
3353 2018-11-13 19:36:58 U.S. oil prices fall 7.1%, a record 12th consecutive decline, over concerns about an oversupplied market and weakening demand  -- The Wall Street Journal
3354 2018-11-13 19:36:54 Gas is the new oil. If prices stay high, it will be more expensive for Quebec to import and more money to make on local. CAQ is not stupid!
3355 2018-11-13 19:36:53 Já viste o que está a acontecer com o Oil? @cryptolobopt
3356 2018-11-13 19:36:46 RUKSA could have put a floor in days ago...chose not to. Is somebody trying to make a point about what happens if they don't cut? Claims of a price drop based upon forecasts don't motivate nearly so much as an ACTUAL PRICE DROP! Methinks some doubters have taken notice...
3357 2018-11-13 19:36:37 @JoeMcMonigle @Hedgeye Enjoy following you on oil. Do you follow Nat Gas also? Looks a "little" extended.
3358 2018-11-13 19:36:35 congrats @realDonaldTrump we're headed to an oil sector localized recession
3359 2018-11-13 19:36:33 #MichukiRules have been there all along it was a good PR to distract #Kenyans especially #KOT talking ill about the new loan of more than Ksh 500B and Kenya buying its crude oil. #TanoTerror
3360 2018-11-13 19:36:29 While Buhari is sinking billions in spiteful search of oil in the deserts of the north
3361 2018-11-13 19:36:24 Oil down 7% 
3362 2018-11-13 19:36:11 $SPY $UWT funny how both oil and the market crashed together in 2008
3363 2018-11-13 19:36:08 Better than your point.

Shares in the oil industry, by any chance?

You people deserve to be mocked off the face of the planet, you’re just selfish, greedy murderers.
3364 2018-11-13 19:35:53 Do it! You shouldn’t let this stop you. Adopt one. Best friends gets kittens all the time. That’s where i got my fluffy one. And dawn soap kills fleas off kittens and is okay for them. Like the duck and oil commercial!
3365 2018-11-13 19:35:43 #Beyond100Days Jo Obrian, a woman with oil under her fingernails and knows her way around an engine bay! #theperfectwoman
3366 2018-11-13 19:35:34 Time to get an oil change I guess.
3367 2018-11-13 19:35:30 @Oreo drop the dirty palm oil!
3368 2018-11-13 19:35:26 @Zama_Omuhle please tag me on your tweets on how to make lemon essential oil.
3369 2018-11-13 19:35:23 Oil at $55.69. Ouch. KREMI numbers looking good for next quarter already.
3370 2018-11-13 19:35:21 Crude oil?
3371 2018-11-13 19:35:11 Can't believe it, my girls have just gone through our cupboards and pull out the things with palm oil in it! Even bloody #MarksAndSpencer white shagging bread!! Deffently after watching the add we will be shopping at Iceland! Well done :)
3372 2018-11-13 19:34:58 Any food alternatives u found that usually have palm oil??
3373 2018-11-13 19:34:57 I really hate the drive thru oil change places where they want you to stay in your car
3374 2018-11-13 19:34:53 Trump boca de sapo, tanto quis o OIL mais baixo que o OIL tomou 27% de queda em 1 mês!!!
3375 2018-11-13 19:34:51 POLL: A 20 to 30% decline in oil prices has what kind of effect on a) the S&P 500 and b) the U.S. economy over the following year?
3376 2018-11-13 19:34:49 I fear that like Putin invading countries,  how long before Trump looks north & says NOT FAIR  Canada has all these resources oil, gas , lumber, etc. We should have them. Sounds far fetched  not any more . We sit between USA, RUSSIA , N KOREA
3377 2018-11-13 19:34:46 You have to wonder what Putin thinks that Trump has this much control over oil prices.
3378 2018-11-13 19:34:43 Late 1960s oil rigs off Newfoundland were supplied by workboats and helicopters. The helicopters took off and landed in zero visibility using Loran. I’m so old I remember using Consolan. We’d take turns with headphones counting beeps.
3379 2018-11-13 19:34:41 it took whole year making round trip, on Nov14,2017, crude oil was 54.81, Tomorrow is going to be one year anniversary , can we see 54.81 again?
3380 2018-11-13 19:34:36 Have you checked all the oil drums?
3381 2018-11-13 19:34:35 And he will continue to drive all around NYC and do everything he can to help get other people driving and supporting the automobile and oil and gas industries!
3382 2018-11-13 19:34:31 You know what I would do when 13 years old?? I’d inflate an inflatable pool and fill it up with sherm and get butt naked and oil myself! WeLCoMe tO my LiFe!
3383 2018-11-13 19:34:31 $80+ for the oil change  time to sell my car
3384 2018-11-13 19:34:27 "WW1 was avoidable", says Michael. Perhaps you would explain why Britain was interfering/agitating in the Balkans well before the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand? Tommies were used and abused, killed for oil, power, influence and land grab.
3385 2018-11-13 19:34:18 Bet Der Spiegel wont report this. Imagine spending ~40M yearly more than city and crying foul for FFP from 8'th place. City Bingo for that would be it's our money not oil money. well if you take away all tv time and sponsors from others where else would they get money from?
3386 2018-11-13 19:34:16 Oil practically done, back to Water.
3387 2018-11-13 19:34:11 Adams County Commissioners voted 3-1 this morning to end the temporary moratorium they placed on oil and gas permit applications, just before the Prop. 112 vote.
3388 2018-11-13 19:34:06 weh hahahahaha aku dah tak mampu nak pakai cleansing oil dia aku pakai garnier jaa sekarang nii nasib baik laa tak breakout lepas tukar haritu huhu weh hang taudak aku dah tak pakai sunscreen biore kuning tuu HAHAHAHAHHA
3389 2018-11-13 19:34:05 You're awfully needy xD, you will have to ask him about the oil change, and we can figure out a day that works
3390 2018-11-13 19:34:03 Love @Bertolli olive oil!
3391 2018-11-13 19:34:02 to hold the racism and oil
3392 2018-11-13 19:34:02 Thanks for reminding me I need to go buy a $9 quart of oil for my car! Serious question: why don't THOSE oil prices ever come down?
3393 2018-11-13 19:34:00 A scruffy but Excellent oil painting of St.Donald floating on top of a Celestial sea shell. "I have come not for myself but for my people that they may have Life and have it more abundantly. Pray alway's for those whom despise and revile me brethren, for they are all of Satan."
3394 2018-11-13 19:33:57 I'd rather buy my oil from Texas, Florida, Ohio or Kentucky anyway. I'd like to see a gas station that guarantees all fuel is sourced in America.
3395 2018-11-13 19:33:37 Between lavender oil and some pretty pink quartz you’ll never be stressed or sick again!
3396 2018-11-13 19:33:34 Right, a bed of shredded cucumber and carrot with the halloumi on top and a drizzle of garlic Olive oil. Warm pitta breads with Thai sauce and hummus as a choice of dippy goodness!
Chuck a tomato on if you're feeling crazy.... 
3397 2018-11-13 19:33:32 Oil an Gold pay a nigga
3398 2018-11-13 19:33:25 cc: @bankofcanada WTI oil -27% in last ~ 5 weeks...
Cdn yield curve flatter:
30s2s = 16bps
30s5s = 9.7bps
30s10s = 3.5bps
30s20s = -1.2bps INVERTED
3399 2018-11-13 19:33:24 It’s the way it should be. No need for big oil to gouge people. No reason gas shouldn’t be $1.50 or LESS
3400 2018-11-13 19:33:22 You said Koch Bros "exploit cheap labor" 
That is false! Koch Bros do NOT advocate for low wage illegal labor. They don't even lobby for their own corporate interests. They lobbied to END oil subsidies for their own oil business! They do what's right for liberty, not themselves
3401 2018-11-13 19:33:18 Combination of slowing global growth, weak gold, and now #oil in freefall means it's only a matter of minutes before #CAD follows. Imagine what happens to #CAD when bond crisis re-escalates - #StrongDollar
3402 2018-11-13 19:33:16 But Q3 was great for oil sector shares.
3403 2018-11-13 19:33:14 $30 Oil always a thing when it crosses $60
3404 2018-11-13 19:33:09 Ditto! I made this very point yesterday or so. There has to be a transition of narrative between #oil price heaven and hell. Fintwit swung from one side to the other. My take
a) $85+ = global economy too expensive to run
b) ~$60 = sweet spot
c) sub $40 ="pack your bags & go home"
3405 2018-11-13 19:33:08 You’re diesel engine, I’m squirting mad oil uh
3406 2018-11-13 19:33:03 Hi there. Only 19% of the world’s total palm oil is sustainable and we use only RSPO certified sustainable palm oil from a segregated supply chain. You can visit our website or email info@nairns-Oatcakes.com and we can give you much more specific information. Thanks
3407 2018-11-13 19:32:59 Seth is too busy having married couple problems with Dean. He'd be too busy outside looking for red cars and flaming oil cans.
3408 2018-11-13 19:32:59 I made hot peppers with garlic and oil in a jar and it's too good
3409 2018-11-13 19:32:56 I can do that but your husband has to give me an oil change. Also you have to give me food. I also require some time with the dogs.
3410 2018-11-13 19:32:55 Oreo, drop the dirty palm oil!
3411 2018-11-13 19:32:45 President of United States has started a huge debacle of crude oil. Probably his two billionaires friends are smiling from ear to ear and buying crude oil stocks   all that when a few millions poor middle class are loosing their savings
3412 2018-11-13 19:32:42 pro tip : add coconut oil, sea salt , lavender and honey to your bath water . u come out soft and moisturized, smells nice too.
3413 2018-11-13 19:32:42 Does the whole MLP sector and or inclusion in MLP funds make is susceptible to selling off on lower oil prices? Guilt by association?
3414 2018-11-13 19:32:42 So 30 years plus in the catering trade and my brother (an oil tanker driver) is advising me how rich I can become by taking on local pub Why do people outside the trade think there is so much money to be made!
3415 2018-11-13 19:32:35 AND, polluting our water, taking our precious land reserves for more oil pollution, throwing out real science for his abstract reality & reasoning, insulting fellow Americans & Allies, pandering to our premier foreign foe, enriching his own coffered at taxpayer’s expense, etc.
3416 2018-11-13 19:32:23 Yes, or more. Fish oil content (3-oz serv, cooked):
1500 mg or more:
-Wild/farmed salmon
-Wild mackerel (Jack and Pacific)
-Wild herring (Atlantic and Pacific)
1000-1500 mg:
-Wild Bluefin tuna
-Wild mackerel (Atlantic and Spanish)
-Canned Mackerel or salmon (pink sockeye, chum)
3417 2018-11-13 19:32:21 Sad and needs to change. @marksandspencer seem to be quite high on the ‘friendly’ list but wouldn’t it be good if they could could palm oil free..

3422 2018-11-13 19:32:04 No, protests like this need to happen. Democrats agreed to stop taking money from oil companies and then started again. We have to keep our values in tact, especially in the face of trump and republicans. Look at what's happening in CA because of climate change! #Accountability
3423 2018-11-13 19:32:04 Oh it won't stop, especially with the fighter planes we're selling to malaysia use biofuel, which is mostly palm oil.

3431 2018-11-13 19:31:22 What happened to the cumbaya moment where we all bend the knee in front of our dear leader ? Time to through in some more oil cash to make it go away 
3432 2018-11-13 19:31:22 On health talks & all.....so much said about Palm Oil, heard much about Salt, what about Pepper? With all this that it is doing to my mouth, what will it do inside my belly?
3433 2018-11-13 19:31:20 The reason Scheer cannot win a national election is because he defends big oil from AB. This is the ball and chain he must drag around. The rest of the country is tired of Alberta whining all the time.

3436 2018-11-13 19:31:12 This is a stick save by Fed/Treasury to try to save the economy through stealth QE (cheap oil). It hurts retirees, oil producers, oil workers, investors, farmers, but who cares about those guys?
3437 2018-11-13 19:31:11 @Oreo I love you for being vegan but I can't buy any more @Oreos until you drop the dirty palm oil! You're so good on progressive issues, please get on the right side of this!
3438 2018-11-13 19:31:10 the chef who closed wih me today said it was MY responsibility to throw away the frying oil ??????? makes no fucking sense that I should be the one to throw it when you’re the one working IN THE KITCHEN
3439 2018-11-13 19:31:06 What does Fuji recommend for editing? Lightroom just isn’t working out for me anymore. Hate the worming and oil painting effect
3440 2018-11-13 19:31:04 This oil crash is amazing. Likely a flush out today, but noting a pivot at $53.75 that is also major. Bought some calls today but will add at $53.75 on crude if it reaches there.
3441 2018-11-13 19:30:56 gotchu, thats jus dosing... i mean by all means if its taking a 'baby' jus to get high from food then u might as well smoke it haha...but it takes about a pound to make an Oz of usable oil/butter...thats expensive for the avg person so they skimp
3442 2018-11-13 19:30:50 I put oil on my nose . like jojoba
3443 2018-11-13 19:30:45 70's was a mix of ups and downs it was 2.40 then down to 1.58 in 76 and then back up to 2.22 in Dec 1979.  We did got to IMF for a bailout in 1976 which was a mixture of oil crisis, recession etc.

3448 2018-11-13 19:30:17 Ladies, I just got an oil change (yes I’m proud of myself although you don’t wanna know how many miles over the limit I had gone ) and lemme yell you, GROUPON SAVED MY LIFE 
3449 2018-11-13 19:30:10 what is OSAS I have no idea for me not being a foolish virgin is not sinning but keeping the body for christ ready for his return so I got oil in my lamp and have not sinned
3450 2018-11-13 19:30:03 @LeahWald @LucidInvestment Could Tyler cover how the lowering oil will affect the stock market? Is it true that major banks hold big positions in oil and could be in trouble because of decreasing prices?
3451 2018-11-13 19:29:38 I used the mane choice choice deep hydration softening milk & argan oil ecostyler to refresh it & whewwww! It looks nothing like how it looked when I first did it lol.
3452 2018-11-13 19:29:37 I wish @vons bakery made cookies minus the palm oil. I love Orangutans having their home.
3453 2018-11-13 19:29:37 Don't wear clothes then? Don't buy electrical goods I assume? No phones? Don't drive a car? Or travel on anything? Yeah, that's called selective outrage. What the UAE does is terrible, oh but not the oil bit, I need that. And cheap clothes, no issues there. Hypocritical bullshit.
3454 2018-11-13 19:29:31 The SNP did not tout oil as the saviour of Scotland, but the writer of the article is touting it as the saviour of the UK.
3455 2018-11-13 19:29:30 I’ve now noticed that Nutella is made from palm oil 
3456 2018-11-13 19:29:23 Great article, it is True that US Oil Sector did support his Campaign. There could be a lot of reason why he is attacking Oil now. But could this be that he is giving an opportunity for the sector buyback their own shares, and then say something stupid to send prices high again..
3457 2018-11-13 19:29:16 EIA forecasts U.S. shale oil output to climb by 113,000 barrels a day in December

3459 2018-11-13 19:29:04 @jeffphilips1

I always counter the argument that Yar'adua's government made a big dent on oil subsidies by reversing the refineries privatization.

Yes the prices were low, should've just upped the amount and ask them to pay the difference.
3460 2018-11-13 19:28:43 Go fuck yourself, she gets shit done while the DNC is taking bribes from the oil industry again.
3461 2018-11-13 19:28:39 Some THC oil drops in water makes for the best water.
3462 2018-11-13 19:28:35 yes its a terrible affliction, the oil. Terrible. Still, Ingerlund can always fukoff and keep their hands off it, I guess

3467 2018-11-13 19:28:18 That being said, warmer oceans means stronger hurricanes, so *some* people are going to die just because oil companies and other corporations need profits more than we need a safe planet.
3468 2018-11-13 19:28:17 Yo! @RaoulGMI you had Macro Insiders Subs in oil @ approx 74 apologies because i totally messed that up  BUT Thanks for the opportunity tho.. All experts were once beginners too i suppose

3471 2018-11-13 19:28:05 Supply & demand as well as free markets are dead. Just hope that the State doesn't come after your favorite investment because they are above the Law w unlimited money. Economy is in trouble this hit on oil is #StealthQE by the collusive Fed/Treasury Unholy Alliance named PPT.
3472 2018-11-13 19:27:54 Showed up to my oil change appointment a whole ass hour early  someone please take me out of my misery, with a gun or conversation, your choice
3473 2018-11-13 19:27:54 @CICSaudi @OPECSecretariat @KremlinRussia_E @IraqiGovt @CrudeOilPrices what the work are your govt. And respectable authority members are doing. Crude is going downwards 12th day consecutively and govt. Can do anything. Today trump earns good profits in crude. #OPEC #oil #Brent
3474 2018-11-13 19:27:50 I relate to all of these so much! I had thick hair, now thinning. A lot due to lyme. Just today I stopped the natural shampoo &conditioner & went back to baking soda &vinegar bc of scalp problems. I can't blow dry at all or it all breaks off! Going to restart Caster oil treatment
3475 2018-11-13 19:27:47 trump in addition to achieving lower oil price, took really good insider short trade, broke the market, broke OPEC strategy. what a cunning orangeguttan. #OOTT

3481 2018-11-13 19:27:26 One of the most ill informed tweets he has done yesterday on oil
3482 2018-11-13 19:27:18 He thought SEAN was a trip to be on Hannity for a couple days and he thought APEC was about oil and how he could have some for himself.
3483 2018-11-13 19:27:16 It is the year 1881 and my associates and I have just placed the stock of Standard Oil under a board of trustees forming the first major U.S. trust. #buisness
3484 2018-11-13 19:26:55 Let's say any and all theories on climate change are absolute rubbish. Addressing them mean less oil dependency, cleaner everything, a shit ton more jobs and a long-overdue thank you to earth.
3485 2018-11-13 19:26:49 coming from the oil painting queen thank you 
3486 2018-11-13 19:26:41 I go like 3 days. If I went a week I'd look like someone dumped oil directly on my head. If I washed it everyday, it would dry it up. The natural oils make for healthy hair! I mean, mine is pretty soft and healthy so I'm assuming it works 
3487 2018-11-13 19:26:35 Ellejay, don’t let facts get in the way of a Unionist’s nonsense. Next she’ll be telling us how great Brexit is & how Oil is a curse 
3488 2018-11-13 19:26:24 Why did fda approve mineral oil if there might be a untoward effect in the placebo group?
3489 2018-11-13 19:26:23 Unlike you, I was corresponding with her during those lean times and know that she wasn't basking in oil wealth but rather living lean. But that doesn't suit your narrative so just keep making things up.
3490 2018-11-13 19:26:20 Immediately stop using all oil and fossil fuels sounds reasonable to you?
3491 2018-11-13 19:26:14 I know some like to view this drop in oil as, “it’s like a tax cut - bullish!” But markets that lose 27% in 6 weeks have real problems. And this market isn’t very forgiving of problems at the moment.
3492 2018-11-13 19:26:11  How about the Palm Oil ban as shown by the banned Iceland ad? some people have more sympathy for orangutangs than unborn humans. I have nothing against orangutangs (not even sure how to spell them )
3493 2018-11-13 19:26:09 $BP under $40 is a major alert, oil will not stay down for long (a few weeks at most) so don’t miss out on the huge upswing coming in the near future ! #CNBC #RedAlert #YouBuyYouBuy #XRP #BTC
3494 2018-11-13 19:26:08 I'm willing to make a bet that Gartman just got short oil.
3495 2018-11-13 19:25:58 So why are activist judges doing all they can to thwart the president's effort to wean the country off mid east oil by blocking the $10B Keystone XL Pipeline? Will @realDonaldTrump allow this challenge to his America First and jobs program to stand?
3496 2018-11-13 19:25:58 right after I get an oil change: WHY WE GOING SO FUCKING FAST????
3497 2018-11-13 19:25:55 Coconut oil keeps me hydrated 
3498 2018-11-13 19:25:47 Don t talk about stealing... you make wars just To make money by stealing oil or gaz.
3499 2018-11-13 19:25:38 My mom, on the current poor air quality from the California fires, which are 100+ miles away: "It's still probably better than the chemical releases and oil spills you got every week in Louisiana." And people wonder why I'm so fatalistic about everything.
3500 2018-11-13 19:25:32 I need some activator x oil anyone use it on the reg ??
3501 2018-11-13 19:25:27 Oil prices today are like the Johnny Cash song. 

How big's the loss, mana?
6.3 percent and rising.
3502 2018-11-13 19:25:24 I Love Oil Pastels!
3503 2018-11-13 19:25:21 Yup. Plus local oil prices divorced from WTI anyway
3504 2018-11-13 19:25:19 How about they deny water to Central Valley AG, to save a damn salamander and dry up,fertile fields to build solar farms?  Can you say green is the new oil?  Jerry was bad, Newsom is going g to make us cry!
3505 2018-11-13 19:25:17 Moosh is on to something. 

Two ingredients that will never feature on my #foodblog are palm oil and orangutan.

3509 2018-11-13 19:25:13 Oil changes are getting cheap though. A basic one is $20, basically the cost of oil plus $5.
3510 2018-11-13 19:25:10 Just had a look at the food and sweets in the house that contain palm oil. Shocking to find how little didn't contain it. #PalmOil #PalmOilFree
3511 2018-11-13 19:25:06 We produce substantially more oil in the United States than they do in the UAE and the Glazers have amassed some of their wealth through oil and gas...imagine that one 
3512 2018-11-13 19:25:04 Hi  we are listed in the Green List, meaning we contain zero palm oil 
3513 2018-11-13 19:24:57 You better load up on that damn squirrel oil

3519 2018-11-13 19:24:32 You need to understand just how much she tried to hide where she got her income from, mainly, American oil companies, because they want Canada to stay dependent.

Do you want Canada to stay dependent? Because Viv still isn't coming clean about this.

Be best, Blair.
3520 2018-11-13 19:24:28 We're far from indifferent. We're happy that you're having success using our products. Due to Health Canada regulations, we are not permitted to prescribe dosage. And we are not permitted to make health claims. We list on our oil bottles and our website the mg per 40 ml bottle.
3521 2018-11-13 19:24:28 All the oil sellers buying natgas? Nuts
3522 2018-11-13 19:24:27 So we've seen this before when oil gets clobbered.... sell equities with profit to cover margins
3523 2018-11-13 19:24:14 It never fails. I go in for a simple oil change, and then they tell me I need $400 worth of other repairs 
3524 2018-11-13 19:24:13 Heard of oil pulling? The latest craze in oral care, which involves swishing coconut oil in your mouth, has many proponents. However, the ADA notes that there have been no scientific studies to prove its benefits. Consult a dentist for all your dental hygiene questions. #dentist
3525 2018-11-13 19:23:54 Billions of dollars was wasted on the fruitless  searching for Oil in the North. A huge amount that would have been used to invest in real infrastructural development of the state,yet nothing was found and billions gone to the winds. Who did this to us
3526 2018-11-13 19:23:48 Spark plugs and oil change too.  Those two things will make her vehicles last much longer if she can just do them herself, whenever.

3529 2018-11-13 19:23:42 Two big move, $GS and $OIL.   Related?  Did a big trade blow up on Goldman?
3530 2018-11-13 19:23:37 This oil is fucking astonishing. The relentlessness is something that tends to happen at absolute extremes, just when you think it’s turning it fucks you a little more. Amazes me every time how it just keeps. On. Fucking. Going!!  #OOTT
3531 2018-11-13 19:23:32 Weakening Chinese data & US supply are going to drive the oil narrative but a washout from trend following & backwardation focused strategies also helps to explain the magnitude of the selloff. Most have gone from long to short in the last few weeks. CTA returns will reveal this.
3532 2018-11-13 19:23:30 Thanks for nominating @CFCanada !
3533 2018-11-13 19:23:30 I would detangle it before I washed it and to detangle I would put a generous amount of coconut oil in my hair.. from the bottom to the top, let it sit a few minutes and brush out, starting from the bottom..

3536 2018-11-13 19:22:59 Suggesting that you need to personally verify historical events is a fallacy promoted by anti-science snake oil salesmen. Don’t join them.
3537 2018-11-13 19:22:58 Many countries would buy Canadian Oil, but this liberal government is failing miserably at getting oil to tide waters... at least Trump is buying our oil.
3538 2018-11-13 19:22:58 People with children should go stock up all the baby oils in stores - two psychos are jobless. They'll surely need more oil
3539 2018-11-13 19:22:57 We invade countries under the guise of spreading democracy aka oil. We ruin these countries & then shut the door on refugees. And we’re rapidly ruining the environment making places uninhabitable & we shut the door on them too. We suck
3540 2018-11-13 19:22:43 I worked in the oil industry. We used North mask with purple cartridge or 3M

3542 2018-11-13 19:22:28 As much as I love Cadbury, big users of palm oil like Cadbury are the reason for this. The focus needs to be on sustainability.

3564 2018-11-13 19:20:43 Trump needs to stop tweeting/talking about the Fed, oil prices, and supposed “anti-trust” violations. Doing so violates both principles of limited government and rule of law.
3565 2018-11-13 19:20:37 Neither did I. I suggested an independent Scotland would re-negotiate the existing contract. Which was a steal for US oil companies
3566 2018-11-13 19:20:36 Iran resilience-led policy has been to substitute gas (high cost export) for oil (low cost) eg 3.5m CNG vehicles & Asouliyeh gas petrochem feedstock. I believe Iran strategy now ignores Europe gas exports in favour of neighbour exports - especially gas/power supply & swaps

3589 2018-11-13 19:18:41 Sure why not. Either idea would cause a serious investment from someone.  Honestly, I’m not sure which would be more economically sound. If not a pipeline then perhaps a filtration system on a ship much like an oil tanker. Either project would need an Elon Musk type of person.
3590 2018-11-13 19:18:39 Their leaking log coated in machine oil thrusted into their fart factory
3591 2018-11-13 19:18:30 Oil price is in correction Bull mode down to $47.50 and this is good for Global shipping Industry now.

3593 2018-11-13 19:18:22 You're on to this story remarkably quickly - almost like the story was a politically motivated plant. National do love their lobby groups after all. Dairy, oil and motorists;
3594 2018-11-13 19:18:14 Crude oil in free fall mode today, down close to 7 percent now. From levels of 72 one month back down to the levels of 55, down close to 24  percent in one month

3599 2018-11-13 19:17:40 A snake oil salesman who flies rockets to the space station and single handedly transformed the legacy automotive industry which will never again sell as many ICE cars as it did in 2017? 
Right

3601 2018-11-13 19:17:25 how come Your not preaching doom, gloom with oil crashing, I would think banks that loaned to oil companies are feeling some heat now...
3602 2018-11-13 19:17:17 Man Charlie is so stingy at the grocery store, need to grab some olive oil? Put it on your xmas list
3603 2018-11-13 19:17:07 No twitter fingers were harmed during this oil drop
3604 2018-11-13 19:17:05 Was so negative, had a hunch and looked her up on Wikipedia.. "Her family followed booms in oil production"... That explains it 
3605 2018-11-13 19:17:04 Oil -5% #OOTT
3606 2018-11-13 19:17:04 And soon falling oil will be the reason to sell EM
3607 2018-11-13 19:16:58 Good. The price and ease of movement of oil needs to increase so that people choose cleaner alternatives.

3610 2018-11-13 19:16:48 Oil and $iwm dragging stuff down
3611 2018-11-13 19:16:47 Anyone I've met, cases online, myself and friends included do not use vegetable oils. Olive oil + coconut oil are mainly used.
3612 2018-11-13 19:16:42 Irving family owns so much in my province including Canada's largest oil refinery in my city. We need a Just Transition for the workers.

3614 2018-11-13 19:16:38 What? The beard oil?
I don’t need it for growth though, I use it for the oils that make the beard healthier.

3616 2018-11-13 19:16:21 y’all be using oil as a moisturizer?
3617 2018-11-13 19:16:14 culture, common purpose, proseperity and self preservation for all citizens regardless of any singular characteristic stands in the way of transnationalism/globalism. Common kinship one feels towards fellow countrymen threatens their goals more thn terrorism
3618 2018-11-13 19:16:12 @mikeredmusic ACV with a couple of drops of cinnamon bark essential oil (doTERRA) is the best).
3619 2018-11-13 19:16:03 Depending on where you’re living and your budget there are tonnes of options. I suggest a light toner with hyaluronic acid (if you live in SEA Hada Labo’s hydrating lotion is great and affordable) followed by a light moisturizer or face oil like marula.
3620 2018-11-13 19:16:00 Money tip: Check your oil once a month when you're pumping gas... it could save you from needing a new engine.
3621 2018-11-13 19:15:51 Trump needs the low oil prices because of Iran and Venezuela. Cheap oil will substantially hurt both countries.
3622 2018-11-13 19:15:42 Actually it does little damage to the lungs. and doesn't damage the brain at all. plus the hemp oil that is in weed cures cancer.
3623 2018-11-13 19:15:33 Lac Megantic was US shale oil not Canadian bitumen. Bitumen does not have the same explosive properties and bitumen can be shipped in a nearly solid state eliminating the potential for spills

3625 2018-11-13 19:15:29 Que bonita !
3626 2018-11-13 19:15:27 Is the supply chain actually released able enough to guarantee sustainable oil.
3627 2018-11-13 19:15:27 There were some moves in this direction is places like Venezuela, although maybe that doesn't count as a "major Western country" and maybe their dependence on oil sales doesn't really count as socialism. But now there's only backlash there in any case.
3628 2018-11-13 19:15:26 not doing anything with oil right now but a lot of posters are feeling a capitulation & supported bottom here. Heck, indexes not down that much and if the selling story is about slower growth and recession in 19, which I believe myself, maybe oil has more downside left. I'll wait
3629 2018-11-13 19:15:22 In 1978, Govt. announces finding a huge oil basin with potential reserve of 100 million barrels.

3631 2018-11-13 19:15:16 #Didyouknow that #AvelinaOats can taste well a little bland?  Take a few extra minutes before you cook them to toast them in a little melted butter, olive oil, or coconut oil on the stove first and they'll gain a nuttiness that can't be beat 
3632 2018-11-13 19:15:09 You are probably correct re: legal. It was probably 3 years ago Scott Nations reco'd oil long. Price never reached his entry, oil ripped $1.50 that afternoon, he boasted, I called him out on it, he then claimed he already got long before the reco...

Then I was blocked. Jokers.
3633 2018-11-13 19:15:00 ermahhhgeurdddd YES! I already kinda do that, avoid putting products in my hair unless its natural. I just got some castor oil! I was reading peppermint oil, there was a clinical trial done with that oil and it helps stimulate hair follicles for growth
3634 2018-11-13 19:14:52 I know I'm not the only one, but I just want to speak for everyone when I say this selloff is amazing.

I don't trade oil or energy companies, just indices and momo... but I can't help but wonder what the impact of US overlevered oil companies will be.

3638 2018-11-13 19:14:13 As someone who gets amazing vegan, plant-based, oil free recipes from bloggers, I am 100% on board with this. Plus sometimes they talk about their recipe development process or a chic restaurant they visited in Spain and my life is fuller for it.
3639 2018-11-13 19:14:11 This oil/gas selloff might put a wrench into the FED's plan to raise interest rates in December.

3645 2018-11-13 19:13:39 Green and SNP supporter? Fracking, digging up oil, disturbing the North Sea environment for Oil?
Can't say i'm that surprised you'd ditch principles of which you supposedly support in favour of cash.

I just mixed up my facial serum and my beard oil oh.
Lmao.
See, I’m going to sleep like that.
3648 2018-11-13 19:13:18 Exactly Iceland are just trying to look good ... all they’ve done is taken a greenpeace ad and then said they’d stop using palm oil in THEIR OWN product ... however they still sell and MAKE PROFIT from selling palm oil products produced by other bigger  brands
3649 2018-11-13 19:13:15 Out of the corner of my eye, I thought that said "crude oil - 6% on ebay."
3650 2018-11-13 19:13:01 It is also baffling that we had to move wheat and fuel via road when rail is evidently the more ideal option. We need to make better decisions around the specific efficiencies needed to oil the economy. Notwithstanding the carnage. @InfoMinZW @kudzie_sharara @TMusarara1
3651 2018-11-13 19:12:58 Palm oil is used in nearly all livestock feed?
3652 2018-11-13 19:12:49 Crude oil is giving away the pain signals on what’s to come for global economy
3653 2018-11-13 19:12:33 Apparent Castor Oil is good for just about anything.... I need to buy it one time and use it for....whatever... Just to see if it's really good.
3654 2018-11-13 19:12:25 Iceland’s Christmas advert raises important issues around palm oil, the same could be said for a lot of dairy alternatives that are grown in similar fashion. Shame it couldn’t be televised!! #buylocal #teamdairy 
3655 2018-11-13 19:12:00 SPX has crashed before oil did, though.
3656 2018-11-13 19:11:58 i have to get my oil changed and my dad is making me go :(

3659 2018-11-13 19:11:51  Motorists countrywide should delay filling up as oil and gasoline markets are plummeting today. Cheaper #gasprices are coming!
3660 2018-11-13 19:11:45 Yum. I cook most everything on a cookie sheet with olive oil. I sometimes do mushrooms and onions for the week and make pizzas for lunch.
3661 2018-11-13 19:11:44 Canadians have to face the fact that American Conglomerates want to own and control all Canadian Oil  !
Their tactics are to demonize the industry by supporting anti-oil groups and driving down the price to starve us out !
So far,  we are falling for it  !
3662 2018-11-13 19:11:30 if i drink my lavender essential oil maybe i will finally calm down
3663 2018-11-13 19:11:25 I’ve been short SPX & NDX cash & I short ATM puts vs. them on dips. That’s been my core risk since early August. Still like it. I’ve also been long deep OTM puts LEAPs since Feb 2018, so those may or may not pay off in next few months. Also short oil. It’s getting interesting.
3664 2018-11-13 19:11:20 Excuse me NPR with your misleading Big Pharma Headline - the studies on Fish Oil and Vitamin D have NOT disappointed.  We are not immortal.  The goal is improving quality of life.  But supplements are a balancing act & understanding body chemistry & how xyz impacts biomarkers.

(how I managed 130,000 miles of travel before the age of 23 without any cell phone or instruction about car maintenance is a marvel)
3667 2018-11-13 19:11:12 Trump eased sanctions on Iran to let Turkey buy oil. Erduwan(sp) laughing all the way to the bank. Now Kim laughing at gullible Donnie. When will this end?
3668 2018-11-13 19:11:07 Oil crash > $HYG crash > $SPX crash?  Is that still a thing?
3669 2018-11-13 19:11:05 The best part about getting a massage is being covered in mother fucking oil 
3670 2018-11-13 19:11:01 I've read and studied a lot of academic health studies in the last year on Vitamins. The Doctor talking about no benefits in Vitamins and Fish Oil on @OANN TV is a quack! From a PhD.
 
@SinatraMD @Ke_iki
3671 2018-11-13 19:10:58 Given the slope of the chart and timing on oil and Natgas you may be into something...oil slope downward is extremely steep and Natgas slope upward is vertical almost.

3673 2018-11-13 19:10:47 $ERX unless you believe we are entering recession, oil will go back up soon.
3674 2018-11-13 19:10:44 The vast majority of the people banging on about the Iceland advert don't actually give a fuck about palm oil.
3675 2018-11-13 19:10:37 Have amazing recipe for brussels sprouts. Washed cut into halves and put into bowl. Mix with solt and oil. Line roast tin with paper and put sprouts here. Then keep about half hour in oven in temperature 200/220 Celsius degrees. Eat very warm  Enjoy!

When it comes to globalization, Herbie 2.0 is clueless. He might get lucky with an overbought USD but he is hoping for oil prices to go down & verbalizing this desire. Does he understand how many world economies depend on the price of crude?  Apparently not...
3680 2018-11-13 19:10:13 Your water must have tea tree oil and coconut
3681 2018-11-13 19:10:07 The recent move in oil prices is an indication that nobody knows where it is going. There are too many variables to factor in. My ability to forecast prices is not better than random guesses. #OOTT
3682 2018-11-13 19:10:04 As always it the marginal barrel produced that matters to price but back during 15/16 crisis the entire HY universe produced ~20% of US oil production.

3687 2018-11-13 19:09:40 Saudi and oil math: All things equal, px needs to rise by ~$4 to make its planned output cut revenue-neutral. As it is, px are $14-$16 below balanced budget acc to IMF - WSJ (12 Jun, when Brent was $70)

3688 2018-11-13 19:09:31 I know it will be hard and near enough impossible to do but I have cut palm oil out of everything except food. I intend to continue to cook from scratch and use processed foods as little as I can. We can all do something a bit better. X

3695 2018-11-13 19:09:20 10/10 to the MD of Iceland in that interview with a very grumpy Piers. As with every food crop, a total ban is not necessary, as there will be some sustainable and environmentally friendly sources of palm oil.
3696 2018-11-13 19:09:02 How he puts them is exactly the way things are , it’s just people would rather believe the snake oil salesmen that get to spout their bile on prime time shows without anyone questioning their lies and deceit
3697 2018-11-13 19:08:52 My dog has BAD separation anxiety so I’ve been leaving him smooth jazz on when i leave for work and also trying different “mellow” meds like tabs and tinctures. Doggy cbd oil is supposed to be really helpful too!
3698 2018-11-13 19:08:52 Si un producto indica oil free debería ser oil free. Y no hacer diferencias si ese oil se refiere a grasa, aceite o aceite mineral. Porque si son oil, de cualquier tipo, ya no son free.

3699 2018-11-13 19:08:44 My take on oil: DXY will get only stronger as the dollar liquidity crimps amid shrinking petrodollar balances.
3700 2018-11-13 19:08:44 market manipulation but let's be frank, trump or no trump, the market has been manipulated for years......I know this, Putin can't like low oil prices for long

3702 2018-11-13 19:08:33 This should be unbanned n yes brexit shud mk a law to ban All palm oil. Let the orangutans live happy, fear free, like we all want to. And all other animals affected in all ways. Animals n Ppls life's R at in Danger. Say No to these products, non shud be md from it.

3715 2018-11-13 19:07:21 There’s a LOT of snake oil being sold in those blockchain bottles, my friend. The basic truth is this: there’s almost *nothing* blockchain does that can’t be done cheaper & better through other means. Blockchain using proof of work creates a hell of an environmental externality.

3728 2018-11-13 19:05:57 The US is having the same problem with the oil/gas industry! We’ve had this problem for the last decade.
3729 2018-11-13 19:05:57 Both Bushes did not want wars but the oil lobby (Jim Baker and Halliburton Cheney) dragged them into wars. Presidents most often don't have enough pull, Obama and Trump included.
IMO, the economy grew more robustly in the last 8-9 years, not having too many ups and downs. But....
3730 2018-11-13 19:05:56 I kno u didnt ask me but you can make your own sugar scrub with mixing coconut oil&sugar even some vaseline and using an exfoliating glove. I do laser hair removal so i have to shave my shit every 3 weeks it gets shavingblemishes and the only thing that has helped was this method
3731 2018-11-13 19:05:51 Oil has totally capitulated
3732 2018-11-13 19:05:48 Will #palmoil standards body @RSPOtweets ever champion real sustainability? This week its members vote on whether to clamp down on labour abusers like @Indofood who go on selling palm oil marked with its logo #RT16 #RSPO
3733 2018-11-13 19:05:45 You mean oil?
3734 2018-11-13 19:05:43 It’s easy to help orangutans - check ingredients - if they include palm oil, don’t buy it - and complain to the manufacturer. Customers power counts. #PalmOilFree
3735 2018-11-13 19:05:38 Oil slick and ejection seat not included :p
3736 2018-11-13 19:05:37 CBD oil got me through recovery of a fractured hip when I got hit on bike. Amazing stuff!

3742 2018-11-13 19:04:57 ...you literally just proved my point by being extremely rude and condescending. I’m pretty sure the locally and ethically sourced chicken breasts I buy don’t have palm oil in them. Same with the moose I eat that my boyfriends family hunted. You aren’t better than other people k?

3749 2018-11-13 19:03:57 I am old enough to remember how rising oil prices were the reason why EMs would die in flames. Ah, the good 'ol first half of... 2018.
3750 2018-11-13 19:03:50 It's interesting because we spend a lot of time talking about little co.s because hopefully that's where the analyst/investor can make a dent, but how many companies do you think it takes to make up half the oil production in Texas? Ten?

3756 2018-11-13 19:02:50 Economically Scotland had helped keep UK afloat since the 80's with our Oil tax revenue, Oil price is now bouncing back which will  generate more revenue & exploration.

3768 2018-11-13 19:02:04 You see how volatility is now spilling over into other assets? Crude Oil is a good example. Is that characteristic of healthy uptrending markets where we want to be buying stocks or downtrending markets where we want to be selling them?
3769 2018-11-13 19:01:59 Get yourself to bed, dosed up with paracetamol, hot water bottle, wrapped up really warm, and sweat it out. Get some olbas oil to sprinkle on your pillow, and balsam tissues. Drink plenty of water.
3770 2018-11-13 19:01:58 USA # are wrong. USA the most diversified economy in the world is not more sensitive that Russia, Indonesia and Canada when it comes to oil price declines.  Maybe the state Alaska is, maybe

E.U. and U.S.A. should have got together years ago and banned ALL palm oil products from Indonesia to U.S. and to Europe, it is not just poor orang-utans being burned alive but all flora and fauna for millions of acres,

3777 2018-11-13 19:01:45 what is palm oil in?
3778 2018-11-13 19:01:36 This is yet another proof that people don't change until they hit rock bottom and are forced to.  Canada oil at $17 vs. world market at $70 is close to rock bottom - but not quite.  Canada can fall further and nothing will change until then.

3780 2018-11-13 19:01:13 USO is getting hammered; but, UNG broke out last week and it looks like it is headed much higher.  Forecasting colder winter & lower demand for oil means lower Natural Gas production, pressuring prices higher.

3797 2018-11-13 19:00:06 -20% Oil drop since Sept. because worry of Iran sanctions, everyone rushed to up their supply before Nov 4 kick in of sanctions. Now the overhang is causing a hangover of supply. So opec says trust us, 'we got this covered, we'll cut now 1MM'. It's too late, the damage is done.
3798 2018-11-13 19:00:05 One day soon we must talk about the amount of oil that comes floating on a plate when you warm “doggy bag” pasta meals the following day. Why are restaurants trying to kill us? 
3799 2018-11-13 19:00:02 I do mostly agree with the sentiment. However, don't you think it's throwing out the baby with the bathwater? Big tech has made our lives better in many ways, so has big oil, big pharma, etc. Government intervention in those industries notwithstanding, aren't they a net benefit?

3849 2018-11-13 18:55:05 I have family in renewables. Right now GOP has made it easy for oil companies. Only when incentives for renewables are increased & disincentive for fossil fuel will transition happen. Simply not able to happen overnight. Renewables need tax subsidy to be profitable.
3850 2018-11-13 18:54:48 Im so confused. Saudi needs oil high because it needs cash. At this price they will run a significant deficit every year. The only that explains this is US requesting Saudi to do this to hurt Iran and Saudi agreeing to a downward spiral of death because Iran will hit ground first

3858 2018-11-13 18:54:08 Guys like you were encouraging investment in the oil business until fairly recently relative to the lead time for oil and gas projects. You still enjoy it's benefits. So, you're a hypocrite.
3859 2018-11-13 18:54:00 Take care. No explanation necessary. But appreciated nonetheless. 

I'm have separate SM accounts for cancer.  Sometimes helps be 'normal' ie to share silly videos, Palm oil petitions etc without thinking about our illness xx
3860 2018-11-13 18:53:58 just go to the target like right there in midtown afterwards and get a diffuser but also if u have candles that dont have scents just drop a drop of each oil into the candle
3861 2018-11-13 18:53:43 Not clear she was. More importantly though, the makeup of the committee to exclude oil and gas-funded representatives would not have happened on its own.
3862 2018-11-13 18:53:36 Don't. Tempt. Me. 

I have access to matches and oil and ways to lock the firedoors.
3863 2018-11-13 18:53:26 Couldn't agree more but unfortunately the oil industry has our politicians in their pockets.  They control the agenda and our best and brightest fascist corrupted ones dance to their tunes.
3864 2018-11-13 18:53:23 So oil marketing companies wti crude around below 66$ while wti around nd below 56$,guys guys ah no need 2 analyse nd do this do dat but pls make sure 2 fuck oil tankers straightly into d dirty stinking asses of so called SECULARISTS jokers who were crying few days back for price
3865 2018-11-13 18:53:17 Slide some oil to me and let me lubricate my mind!
3866 2018-11-13 18:53:16 i never see you invest in commodities - why not oil for the bounce
3867 2018-11-13 18:53:16 Simple....OIL... Iran's ranking in world: 5. Iran – 4.13 million barrels per day - EU and China have always trade oil with Iran even since 1979 (original sanctions)
3868 2018-11-13 18:53:11 Oil... #OOTT
3869 2018-11-13 18:53:11 This oil crash is unbelievable. Worst on record.
3870 2018-11-13 18:53:11 Did you make an updated analysis of oil ?
3871 2018-11-13 18:52:53 I bought some oil #formica
3872 2018-11-13 18:52:52 Sat at the dealership for an hour and a half for an oil change and got it for free. Now that’s adulting done right 
3873 2018-11-13 18:52:52 put those on a candle or an oil diffuser if u have one and feel better
3874 2018-11-13 18:52:44 @WOOLWORTHS_SA So I was shocked to see just how many of your own-brand products have palm oil/palm fat products in them; everything down to bread and wraps 
Surely there’s a better alternative? 
3875 2018-11-13 18:52:36 Just got a double cheeseburger  & fries  w/ enough grease &amp; oil between them to light the lamps of 19th century London BUT I got a Diet Coke so it’s basically a healthy, balanced meal. Basically. 
3876 2018-11-13 18:52:28 Juul was on red this morning at 5 AM and my charger’s at work... still going strong. I’m basically like the Jews in the temple when their oil should have run out but it lasted for 8 days and nights. L’chaim.
3877 2018-11-13 18:52:24 I love the oil spill one, too! How is the play doh process one?
3878 2018-11-13 18:52:24 listen. fuck where u live. go downtown. go to the magic cauldron. go to that oil shelf. get mint, lavender, and ginger.
3879 2018-11-13 18:52:17 I shared the greenpeace advert when it first released and no one batted an eye and now Iceland’s had it banned for their Christmas advert everyone’s going crazy over palm oil? 
3880 2018-11-13 18:52:07 (that’s an assumption, that Mr. Tiley follows crude oil. it all makes sense, Anti TSLA Success, Pro Oil Success. tell me if i’m wrong.)
3881 2018-11-13 18:51:58 I just signed, even though I don't live in the UK. Palm Oil/Deforestation is a Global issue.
3882 2018-11-13 18:51:54 Why they make you feel like shit getting your oil change though

3884 2018-11-13 18:51:51 Wow I'm about to post on IGTV for the first time ever!

Of course I had to make a fool of myself - My first video is on how to make a CBD Oil Scalp Mask :D

I put the mask all up in my scalp and to me it's pretty silly so I hope everyone will get a kick out of it.

:)
3885 2018-11-13 18:51:51 It really frustrates me when any teacher in a school berates a pupil. Just for that reason I wanted to get into teaching. The pupils I helped were incredible, every1 had written them off. I Gained my Degree to do PGDE ended up on Examinations Boards of oil Industry now Education

3890 2018-11-13 18:51:24 Its not a cure all. But I can attest to the fact it definitely helps with anxiety and insomnia.. there are many other symptoms but I personally know it helps with them. and when I say make, I just mean mixing the right oil (mct) with the cbd powder (isolate) into a dropper bottle

3899 2018-11-13 18:50:58 Oil is a volatile commodity. 2% change in projections for next year can cause 25% price erosion. Right now low growth expectations & ramp up in production from Russia/OPEC and iran waiver etc are causing this collapse.

3901 2018-11-13 18:50:54 Yup, there's something wrong with most stuff once you start looking but don't panic! Stay sane and eat less palm oil, not none, find alternatives. Biscuits are quite easy if you eat butter - no palm oil in shortbread or Choco Leibniz. Or make your own! #NoPalmOilChristmas
3902 2018-11-13 18:50:54 I do like the idea of pipelines for drinking water instead of oil. If a pipele broke clean water might even help clean up their contaminated soil.
3903 2018-11-13 18:50:54 No, we need to get out of the oil business entirely. Change the mindset. Be an example for the world. Cut subsidies so that the true cost is revealed.
3904 2018-11-13 18:50:48 Pull back in oil may be over for now $UWT
3905 2018-11-13 18:50:44 Wars are norms for the US Economy. Tenn_rich proudly claimed he served in the Gulf War. Well that was a Mercenary War for Oil in which US made a profit from other countries. I was not for that war or any other wars. But you know, Congressional Military Industrial Complex.
3906 2018-11-13 18:50:43 LOL... You feel free to ignore facts and spin your delusional BS. Odd to see someone attack big oil, while vehemently defending it. I have work to do. *blocked

3909 2018-11-13 18:50:37 So why don’t we have an oil fund like Norway? We didn’t blow all that money investing in our infrastructure up here. Do you get paid to tweet SNP bad all day?

3914 2018-11-13 18:50:22 US is now the largest produer in the world, last think Trump wants is the price of oil to crash.  he wants it back at $70.  but if they want a hike in the gas tax first to fund infrastructure, oil going to $40's first

3917 2018-11-13 18:50:15 any oil you buy, make sure u read the ingredients. i used to use that hollywood oil shit but it has perfume in it & other things u don’t want on your skin or scalp
3918 2018-11-13 18:50:14 trump wants lower oil prices and he is getting his wish at least for oil
3919 2018-11-13 18:50:13 Also most of those animals have ingested the oil and wind up dying anyway...
3920 2018-11-13 18:50:05 @waitrose I've just noticed your granola contains palm oil. Is it from sustainable sources?
3921 2018-11-13 18:50:02 Just bought my first essential oil. #itbegins

3928 2018-11-13 18:49:30 Every passing month more and more EVs will be produced. Oil is in a death spiral.
3929 2018-11-13 18:49:30 More complicated but includes UK working on a trade deal to import palm oil just when the EU is scheduled to ban imports of anything other than sustainable palm oil. Also includes not using an ad agency.

3933 2018-11-13 18:49:24 Trump must have some kind of magic because oil prices are supposedly the result of a complex set of circumstances.
3934 2018-11-13 18:49:17 Stock market is fine, oil price going down which is good, I really do not know what your talking about.
3935 2018-11-13 18:49:16 November 13 2002 - A storm burst a tank of the oil tanker MV Prestige which was not allowed to dock and sank spilling 63000 tons of oil
3936 2018-11-13 18:49:15 @KITKAT is Nestle, even if they start using sustainable or no palm oil they’re still a morally repugnant and ethically dubious company #BoycottNestle @babymilkaction
3937 2018-11-13 18:49:06 Disagree on the other points to varying extents  but can't here - how hell can a country with that much oil NOT work as socialist country. They can even keep toilet roll on the shelves FFS!
That said, is the caravan actually from Venezuela? If they have clean asses that's a no.
3938 2018-11-13 18:49:06 Having a car is nice until you have to consistently put gas, get an oil change, new tires etc. 
3939 2018-11-13 18:49:04 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
3940 2018-11-13 18:49:01 You  an use tea tree oil but you have to use another oil like Jojoba oil to dilute it because using tea tree oil by itself is too strong , you can also use a cream moisturizer.
3941 2018-11-13 18:48:58 cmon the rise in oil was an election squeeze play 

dont pretend
3942 2018-11-13 18:48:54 If it’s good quality, cold pressed pumpkin seed oil added to a salad dressing or used cold I would say it’s ok. The problem is industrial oils produced from crops like rapeseed, cottonseed and soybean and heated to high temps
3943 2018-11-13 18:48:46 Burning the midnight oil
3944 2018-11-13 18:48:39 I think he’s just salty that crude oil is doubtful to make a legitimate bounce back. 

Let the man dream.
3945 2018-11-13 18:48:38 What's the reason? Is it because of no Iran sanctions? or Did the oil producing countries increase production? or the hurricane season is over in the US and no production returned to normal?
3946 2018-11-13 18:48:26 Both Trump and you don’t know sh^t about California’s landscape. Southern California is desert  Northern California is forest  Central is agriculture and oil fields. And national parks spread all the way down the coast.
3947 2018-11-13 18:48:23 Oil now also a risk asset. Plot oil vs. the ratio of EM msci equity index to the S&P 500. Great relationship stretches back to China WTO in 2001. As EM financial conditions tighten this impacts oil demand. Capacity for USD liabilities on oil consumer balance sheets decreases.
3948 2018-11-13 18:48:20 Hahaha, oh no am I so old that I think Oil of Olay is a reference everyone will get
3949 2018-11-13 18:48:16 Well oil is down, so they are happy about cheap oil for their tiki torches? Not sure how that relates to voting but if you throw in the word "Jesus" they somehow can connect anything together.

3953 2018-11-13 18:48:05 Yes. Heavy cut to pump it to $90 and then let it trickle down to $75. Gets back to $65 and repeat. In a recession better to let the price crash to $20 to wipe out the US shale oil patch which won’t be able to refinance and then OPEC regain market share.
3954 2018-11-13 18:48:00 Oil is the one watch..with sustained move lower, inflation would cool off, US shale producers would be in trouble and whole job market suddenly less tight
3955 2018-11-13 18:47:56 “Yours just happened to be this one this time.” Seriously? What non-profit does that?! No thanks! You can’t care about population growth if you are saying, “but one is okay.” Imagine Greenpeace if they said, “a few oil spills are okay.” What other childfree group wants my $$$?
3956 2018-11-13 18:47:54 ya why he kills oil post election makes zero sense, unless they are going for a hike in the federal gas tax

3965 2018-11-13 18:46:28 Low oil prices will lead to reduced Saudi budget, reduced imports of weapons(mainly from the US), lots of US jobs at stake, Saudi biggest importer of arms by a long way, Saudi will reduce output as they want $80, Trump can't control the market, #OPEC still has 30% of market

3978 2018-11-13 18:45:32 So you’re introducing legislation that the entire US economy and energy consumption will be 100% renewable in 10 years, correct? No more oil, coal or natural gas. Period.

3983 2018-11-13 18:45:14 I am actually in Canada we have the same mess with our politicians however who are looking to expand the tar sands, build more pipelines and Lng terminals to export fracked gas. Underlining issue where i am is corporate capture of our government by oil industry.

3986 2018-11-13 18:44:59 Sorry to read the tariffs have hit your business hard. I read oil is headed for $100 a barrel. For the oil men it’s great news, for shipping companies, not so good. Always seems to be a benefit for one, while someone else finds it a reason to complain.  Perspective is everything.

4003 2018-11-13 18:43:26 And that's why Thier development has been rapid in the last 5years, in Nigeria our incentives are only for oil marketers and some shady businesses, they can't even make deals with the private sector that can benefit the people, damn shame.

4008 2018-11-13 18:42:55 This will get production up just like oil and then they'll Overkill it down I know a lot of these Nat gas companies set in contracts months or yearly the contacts in the market right now are really just for stuff going out of the Henry hub sock it to the other countries
4009 2018-11-13 18:42:54 Why? If you worried about habitat destruction for all foods, you'd be left with pretty much nothing to eat. You do realise they are hypocrites, who have simply replaced it with another oil which is equally destructive to rainforests and other areas - rapeseed and shea. #con

4021 2018-11-13 18:41:46 So what are their solutions, to raise taxes? If they really want to combat climate change, Get rid of gas cars, but that won’t happen because big oil owns a lot of the country, this is all a hoax to raise your taxes, they don’t have a plan in place! Nothing to actually reduce it
4022 2018-11-13 18:41:45 If enough effort is put in, we can extract oil by squeezing sand. You may be able to drink water at a mirage. It is also possible to even spot a rabbit with horns while roaming around the world. However it is impossible to get a stupid to see logic.

4028 2018-11-13 18:41:14 Cause oil demand has become a lot less correlated / in elastic to GDP growth. Probably also why IEA has consistently underestimated demand growth over past several yrs
4029 2018-11-13 18:41:13 But at the end of the day they’re living in honestly one of the most frustrating areas on the east coast! Enjoy that money while arranging an entire Saturday around getting your oil changed!
4030 2018-11-13 18:41:08 Oil has dropped from $76 on October 3rd down to $56 today... what is oil trying to tell us about economy???? To much supply? Not enough demand?    Both!

I know it is NOT a substitute for regular brushing and flossing.

However, I don't like the taste and aftertaste of mouthwash, so I never use it. So would it be alright to use coconut oil,…

4061 2018-11-13 18:38:50 Well if u think how he got Iran oil waiver lifted for his country, that is a pretty good opportunity thrown his way based on the current situation we are all in. Come on, why else release the pastor, his utter goodwill.
4062 2018-11-13 18:38:49 If you make your own out of a raw pumpkin, bake them in coconut oil, and lots of salt, they are delicious. You can't overeat because it's a totally different animal.
4063 2018-11-13 18:38:48 No, they shouldn’t. We need to make a change. Climate change is real. Corporate profits won’t mean anything if we continue using fossil fuels. It has to end. It’s not like the oil companies would go out of business, we still will need plastics & other petroleum based products.

4073 2018-11-13 18:37:59 @Dove what does certified mean. A document to say its OK to plant palm oil, that for every palm planted a native tree will be planted. Not good enough if that's the case. No to palm oil. Every company needs to stop using palm oil now.

4087 2018-11-13 18:36:29 If there really was a pending disaster, you’d stop Tweeting.

Tweeting uses electricity from fossil fuels (drilling/burning) or renewables (clear cutting/dams).  And the devices are made from plastics (oil/drilling) and metals (mining).
4088 2018-11-13 18:36:21 Frustrating that common reaction to this story will be "No one agrees, so everything in moderation!" Then they'll keep eating canola oil and fearing sat fat, since that's the mainstream default.
4089 2018-11-13 18:36:12 Is there such a thing as "responsible" palm oil production? How much of it is grown on former forest or other land that is been cleared & its wildlife depopulated? Palm oil use fosters demand, which leads to clear-cutting forests. Helmer would kill the Earth for a quick profit.
4090 2018-11-13 18:36:11 OIL CRISIS ???
4091 2018-11-13 18:36:10 @FairQuestions  Thank you for your good work in bringing facts to light. However, the term 'tar sands' is inaccurate: Oil sands is the more accurate term as it describes what is derived from the deposits (oil) and what the bitumen is mixed with at the time of extraction (sand).
4092 2018-11-13 18:36:08 Slow downward move?  In the context of history, this is about as quickly as you've seen oil move move 20+% lower.

4103 2018-11-13 18:35:14 Do you not understand that that phrase is racist to its core? There is not an un-racist usage for it? And do you really support corporate Dems who are in bed with big oil AND the GOP? Do you know that we're running out of time to even slow global warming? Smh
4104 2018-11-13 18:35:12 The other problem they guessed. Oil leaking and messing up sparks plugs or something like that.
4105 2018-11-13 18:35:11 That's a lovely view to have but it rarely gets results.
People won't check every item in their trolley for palm oil,they simply are too tired,checking their phones or can't be bothered.

4136 2018-11-13 18:32:31 I gotta go deal with our broken healthcare system for my parental unit.  Healthcare and rural America are like oil and water for how well they work together.
4137 2018-11-13 18:32:27 Yes! Go Alexandria! Don't let the corporate Dems stop you from fighting for the most important causes! Tell the DNC to stop taking money from big oil! They're literally killing our planet! #TeamAOC

4139 2018-11-13 18:32:14 Getting an oil change is one of the biggest pains in the ass
4140 2018-11-13 18:32:13 I wanna check your oil with my dipstick... :-)
4141 2018-11-13 18:32:09 How can anyone be bullish stocks with what we are seeing in growth proxies?? OIL crashing now. And what is the Fed doing?? Serious question... Anyone think the Fed learned something in 2008 and raising rates too much/too fast?
4142 2018-11-13 18:32:05 Time to tweet about natural gas. Have you seen how the bills will come this winter. You made oil drop, now make the natgas affordable too.
4143 2018-11-13 18:32:03 Thank you for the correction! In which case, hats off to @Greenpeace for making it, and props to @IcelandFoods for trying to get a message out there and for ditching as much palm oil as possible.
4144 2018-11-13 18:31:57 I'm sure it's happened but I can't remember such a divergence between oil and gas ….. ever..
4145 2018-11-13 18:31:55 Gonna tell oil execs to "cut it out!"
4146 2018-11-13 18:31:54 Anyone think Putin might be getting a little shaky with oil crashing down under $56 bbl?
4147 2018-11-13 18:31:42 Iceland using their Christmas advertising budget to raise awareness of the effects of deforestation, and to try and reduce the use of palm oil, is the real Christmas spirit 
4148 2018-11-13 18:31:42 I made like a quart of oil one time. I was putting that shit in everything. Pasta salad, Subway sandwiches, mixed with peanut butter, just drinking it str8.
4149 2018-11-13 18:31:42 My questyion is and has always been why can't we build fresh water conversion plants up and down the west coast and install a sprinkler system from the pacific into the forrest thru out the west coast we can build pipe lines for oil WHY NOT?
4150 2018-11-13 18:31:42 Suddenly #oil is, what is the professional term,... oh yes, NOT GOOD.
4151 2018-11-13 18:31:40 The plan was to write from home today but apparently adulthood means you have to do errands like snow tires, oil changes and getting the cat to the vet
4152 2018-11-13 18:31:32 2002 – The oil tanker Prestige sinks off the Galician coast and causes a huge oil spill
4153 2018-11-13 18:31:26 Sorry, my mistake. Trump shut down banking to STOP them from getting money for their oil.

4154 2018-11-13 18:31:25 I sense we might have to commission an art piece of a possum coyote redneck scene. Lawn chairs around an empty oil drum fire pit, cheap beer, shooting bottle rockets at each other?!
4155 2018-11-13 18:31:24 Hot shot in the oil field. And I use the money I earned to pay rent. I figured that was a given lol.
4156 2018-11-13 18:31:21 It warms the oil up so that the engine is lubricated and not as much strain on it to work.
4157 2018-11-13 18:31:16 It’s now or never to save #orangutans: key #palmoil vote happening to urge global palm oil body @RSPOtweets to insist that members like @Indofood commit to ‘No #Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ #RT16 #RSPO

4161 2018-11-13 18:31:07 The government of Denmark has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Amanda Seyfried in a shot silk wig.

4165 2018-11-13 18:30:53 reading about palm oil and had to facepalm quite hard because it's just, like. humans are incredibly stupid and selfish and i can't understand why. imagine ALL THE RESOURCES on earth and you bulldoze forests and kill orangutan habitats so you can sell a biscuit.

4168 2018-11-13 18:30:44 Nat Gas highs very inflationary. Crude oil price not really important this time of year.
4169 2018-11-13 18:30:40 Russia is a rather small economy. It plans on $78 oil. I have an inkling that the oil price crash was manufactured to weaken Putin.
4170 2018-11-13 18:30:39 No I'm not young and have known since the 70s our roads were heading for gridlock and watched the tories waste a windfall in oil money as 3 million unemployed people could not get work
4171 2018-11-13 18:30:39 Idk if you have world market by you but I love all of their reed diffusers last so long and smell really good. Depending on how much oil you put in there it lasts me 6+ months and every week or so I just flip the reeds over

4189 2018-11-13 18:29:36 We send money to keep their politicians quiet. How do we get the money? We work for it you say, no we just print money (free) and force other nations to buy oil and other minerals in US currency.  They want you to believe how hard we work, but in reality we’re hardly making anyth
4190 2018-11-13 18:29:29 Palm oil kills Orangutans .. Pearse idiot Morgan !
4191 2018-11-13 18:29:23 This morning I dripped my red liquid lipstick on my boob, I did not notice right away, then when I discovered it and thought it was blood, I was so concerned about how I had stabbed my boob open. Luckily some coconut oil and witch hazel got it clean
4192 2018-11-13 18:29:17 There is a whole lot of nonsense  being spread around palm oil.  Pretty much all of it is  false propaganda.   People get so swept up in their  make believe moralistic fads these days   Makes on wistful for  proper fads like bell bottom jeans and hair bands.
4193 2018-11-13 18:29:11 So now you gonna screw up the wine market? You tried to bring gas prices down but low gas prices is bad for US oil exploration. So prices are going back up. This occurs because you don’t really understand how things work. This is why you have 16 failed businesses.
4194 2018-11-13 18:29:10 น่าเลีย น่าดุดมากกกๆ
4195 2018-11-13 18:29:07 Yeah, so is Big Oil who funds her
4196 2018-11-13 18:29:05 What that plan suggests is not socialism. In Venezuela, the people owned their oil reserves and were given money from those oil sales...kinda like...Alaska residents. Please point out where in this plan that all citizens as a whole would own these companies.
4197 2018-11-13 18:29:02 It *used* to taste nice before 2010 before Kraft Mondalez takeover. Too much palm oil now. Roses the last time I tried were awful and in bigger wrappings and less in 'box'. Prefer lindt or even aldi stuff!

4254 2018-11-13 18:25:44 But we just need a pipeline Diane! If we build one, all those jobs will come rushing back! Never mind that no pipeline will solve the biggest problem Alberta’s oil industry is facing: Who did we sell to now that the customer that bought 99% of our oil is self-sufficient?
4255 2018-11-13 18:25:43 Still more than twice the price of 13 years ago and oil is cheaper.
4256 2018-11-13 18:25:36 Nope.  It's ridden the oil price last couple of years to slightly better health, but needs it nearer $100.  It doesn't have much to speak of other than extractive industries and its people are shockingly poor. Yes its state debt is low, but no one wants to lend to it anyway.

4259 2018-11-13 18:25:28 I don’t think this is to do with luck factor nor BJP have any control in Oil price movement.  This is what Mr Trump twitted just before 24 hours. “Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!”
4260 2018-11-13 18:25:27 The strategy is to push dems to stop taking oil/gas money. It’s actually not that hard.

4270 2018-11-13 18:24:41 To be honest I'm more keen on us taking responsibility for action ourselves rather than targeting investors or relying on govt regulations.

4285 2018-11-13 18:23:23 It’s official. Imo trump is a complete fool when it comes to global oil markets. If lose my job bc he wants get into a pissing match with opec. I’ll never forgive him. I hope he knows something I don’t. Or has a truck up his sleeve. I know the price needs to between 50-70.
4286 2018-11-13 18:23:18 Oil hedge, oil hedge oil hedge
4287 2018-11-13 18:23:17 No oil, real thing only. Alba truffles are in season... Spaghetti cacio e pepe e tartufo.

Or, risotto also works well.
4288 2018-11-13 18:23:15 Olive oil &amp; Mustard oil are the better ones, when it comes to cooking oil.
4289 2018-11-13 18:23:14 Because shrink is a purple powerup, and none of the other purples show who’s been affected. It would be out of place with magnet/oil spill if it showed who was hit.
4290 2018-11-13 18:22:58 Apart from them using palm oil 
4291 2018-11-13 18:22:56 Der is engine oil in der brain
4292 2018-11-13 18:22:46 não é por nada não ... mas o oil tá querendo ir nos $55 !! o.O
4293 2018-11-13 18:22:44 The down move in crude oil has been savage.  Going from a 4+ year high at $76 in October to $56 now.  China/EM demand must be dropping fast.  Just now entering weak seasonal period for crude oil that lasts till end of January.
4294 2018-11-13 18:22:40 Yup coal is going down. Thats why the Port Of Van is the largest shipper of coal on the Planet and it’s all going to China/Asia. The U.S. is now the #1 exporter/producer of oil & Nat Gas. Yup fossil fuels are on their way down. LOL.
4295 2018-11-13 18:22:39 Honestly if I worked at the harvest center forever I would never have a need for a boyfriend. Between the shop guys I get my oil changed, lunch on the occasion, and someone to talk to when needed. Basically my emotional and car needs are already taken care of 
4296 2018-11-13 18:22:28 Isn't that like trying to sell oil to the Saudis? Not that he's supposed to be selling anything to anyone.
4297 2018-11-13 18:22:20 I put no,  but that' cuz I always want oil to be cheaper
4298 2018-11-13 18:22:15 I need rosemary hip seed oil & vitamin e oil omg.
4299 2018-11-13 18:22:03 And in that new structural scenario, the oil companies got busy lowering their labour costs. Before Trudeau or Notley were on the scene.
4300 2018-11-13 18:21:54 365 points oil -6%
4301 2018-11-13 18:21:47 #WTI #Crude #Oil, 1. pos. futures down -6.01% to 56.33
4302 2018-11-13 18:21:45 Yes, only the question is how high are the producers cost. I'm thinking on expansive oil! So oil from sands or deep and arctic sea > can't be the same price!
If only the oil price is not a political price. 
4303 2018-11-13 18:21:44 True....watch @hasanminhaj @patriotact and he clearly shows the issues that we're currently facing in relation to our leaders, oil, and our limited time frame.
4304 2018-11-13 18:21:35 2 Macc1 Esdr 22:24 I thank my God, and be ready against that man, and oil:
4305 2018-11-13 18:21:27 I absolutely love their scrubs and body creams with essential oils for specific uses. That is so unique and they can let you know what oil does what!
4306 2018-11-13 18:21:23 This sounds stupid until you realize that blockchain is responsible for a lot of oil being burned for electricity.
4307 2018-11-13 18:21:21 Best place to get oil changed in Huntington?
4308 2018-11-13 18:21:13 USA said to Saudi Arabia that they should flood the market with crude oil so that Venezula&Russia will be under economic pressure & get internal problems. In exchange Saudi Arabia is allowed to bomb the region around it and install pro Saudi governments. So yeah classic diplomacy
4309 2018-11-13 18:21:10 Show me on the chart where crude oil touched you.

4320 2018-11-13 18:20:20 Renewable energy is the future. Oil is an unsustainable energy source.
4321 2018-11-13 18:20:10 Ano a country like the UK with a growth rate of 1.5% is a disgrace would be no growth if it was not for the oil .
4322 2018-11-13 18:20:06 Happy Birthday! Coconut oil.
4323 2018-11-13 18:20:05 @waitrose hello. Any answer on the palm oil?
4324 2018-11-13 18:19:54 Got the leak fixed & a free oil change
4325 2018-11-13 18:19:50 The bottom fell out of oil which was venezuela's main commodity
4326 2018-11-13 18:19:47 @davidfaber getting tired of all pundits saying Powell is doing 'right thing' but what really mean is he is standing up to Trump. 
But a bigger man would do what is right and considering the data;PPI, OIL,  etc rate hike in Dec wrong forget saving his face
4327 2018-11-13 18:19:39 In the interim OPEC (aka Supply Management) tried to kill off the US shale industry by adding more supply and dropping prices. This caused the shale producers to become a lot more efficient/cost-effective - and the oil sands, too, for that matter.
4328 2018-11-13 18:19:39 @RaoulGMI as an India watcher could you help me with this . So oil going lower is a big plus , other comms going lower is too , but with India still relatively exp , where do you see it going ? I’m stuck between thinking it’ll follow global markets down
4329 2018-11-13 18:19:36 And the minute the oil price goes the other way, up goes the petrol.  Same with gas and electricity...
4330 2018-11-13 18:19:23 Hurry. Everyone short oil.
4331 2018-11-13 18:19:23 Sulfate free shampoo , conditioner, deep conditioner, trim , hot oil treatment ..
I wash it when it’s dirty ..

4332 2018-11-13 18:19:13 look at the price of oil today
4333 2018-11-13 18:19:12 Fires may be seen thermically on many regions rich of oils
South Pole completely burning it's oil layers
All CO2 out. CO in the atmosphere
4334 2018-11-13 18:19:11 utar jata h use oil or lotion 
4335 2018-11-13 18:19:07 They even eat groundnut oil
4336 2018-11-13 18:18:57 油を英訳すると、なんて言うか知ってるかい?
4337 2018-11-13 18:18:49 The point is, it doesn’t have to. It’s true, there are issues with any power production. However, renewables cause far less harm. Every time we try to incentivize the move to renewables, we get blasted by oil companies who’s propaganda gets conservatives all bent.
4338 2018-11-13 18:18:49 No palm oil, so I can have a conscience free christmas
4339 2018-11-13 18:18:46 Unpopular opinion: it makes no sense to boycott palm oil if you're still consuming animal products.  Animal agriculture is THE leading cause of deforestation and habitat destruction. Even more importantly, cows, pigs, chickens, fish, etc. matter just as much as orangutans.
4340 2018-11-13 18:18:32 Get an oil diffuser and load that bitch up with more oil than it tells you to use and you’ll be good for like 8 hours at least
4341 2018-11-13 18:18:24 Whole point of Iceland running advert is that they are banning palm oil from their products
4342 2018-11-13 18:18:22 My is car was:
1.)  Engine Oil - wipe dipstick.  My was add 1 quart.
2.)  Power steering fluid - normal.  Do not overfill.
3.)  Brake fluid - Max.
Just a note.
4343 2018-11-13 18:18:19 Cannabis oil is the best pain killer, I know! Just saying...
4344 2018-11-13 18:18:18 Nothing like it. In this case the diesel may have components that react with the fuel oil causing the blend to breakdown (stability) or produce deposits. (compatability). These components may not be in one crude but in seperate crudes.
4345 2018-11-13 18:18:11 Give us the technology your black programmes have,then we wont need Saudi oil anymore,change the world mr trump. MAGA
4346 2018-11-13 18:18:02 Thanx for stopping the offer with indian/hp oil 
Soon i will get more proof and will handover to u 
How a guy and the oil pump manger looted  phonepe  for more than  5lakh 
And if u still didnot get it 
They were doing fake txn 
At pump and taking money from manager
4347 2018-11-13 18:17:53 Of course, that's what we all want. We need change. Our habits, what we eat, how we shop. Also no knee jerk reactions like the one to ban all palm oil. Until there is an alternative, sustainable palm oil is what we should be pushing for.
4348 2018-11-13 18:17:51 That was the goal at first - to use up everyone elses oil before our own. But its also good to buy American sell American in a Trumped up economy. Especially while alternative energy vehicles are selling and being produced at record numbers every year.
4349 2018-11-13 18:17:44 Hopefully, USA will reduce the prices of its products as a parallel act to the low oil prices. Don’t you think so.
4350 2018-11-13 18:17:42 $oil talk about hardcore manipulation, 55?

 just keep lowering the numbers.....unbelievable lol
4351 2018-11-13 18:17:41 French, German, LOL. Oil, water. #justsayin And only a joke...can make due to some German in family.

But I don't like the anti-French remark, Brooklinjim.
4352 2018-11-13 18:17:40 If you wanna heat Chinese food putting it in a skillet with a bit of oil is usually the way to go
4353 2018-11-13 18:17:38 What a excellent initiative. @Oreo You know that a day it will be impossible for you to use palm oil so why you don't stop it right now ? What is you real goal, make a lot of money ? Or make cookies  Stop using palm oil won't make you poor so what are you waiting for ? @Oreo
4354 2018-11-13 18:17:29 Helps restore the oil levels from your scalp because every time you shampoo they have to work harder to restore all the oil washed away to keep hair healthy, “no pooing” as it’s called helps to maintain oils
4355 2018-11-13 18:17:19 Get her off the pills. Go get online and get her a bottle of cbd oil . Medical marijuana will cure her too.
4356 2018-11-13 18:17:18 In a nutshell, history went a lil different after the cuban missile crisis.
-We never invented transistors, hence the vacuum tubes and cathodic ray screens.
- Peak oil was real (cus it isnt), and the world started to run out of oil...so we went nucular instead. Hence the cars.
4357 2018-11-13 18:17:18 I want @RSPOtweets to vote to ensure palm oil companies adopt ‘No #Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ #palmoil policies. I can’t bear to see our #rainforests & precious #orangutan habitat destroyed #RSPO #RT16
4358 2018-11-13 18:17:16 BUT we got it out there! My point exactly.. How do we fight better next time? What did we learn? Big Oil companies have big $ and fight DIRTY.  It's not EASY like people think.. We've GOT to ban together on a better PLAN.. These are the answers for the futures!
4359 2018-11-13 18:17:15 Do we really have to have a law to protect hard working OCD auto mechanics/detailers from ruining their family vacation with a spontaneous oil change and car detailing in a national park?  Is an oil change, a car wash, or a car waxing ever an "emergency"?
4360 2018-11-13 18:17:11 Do you go to coal miners and oil drillers for an objective assessment of the environmental costs of those systems of production? Or would you be more inclined to trust the likes of the IPCC, even though many of them likely lack first-hand experience producing fossil fuels?
4361 2018-11-13 18:17:10 Remember what getting banned did for FGTHollywood!
It launched them to stardom.
HSBC apparently funds palm oil production via rainforest destruction.
This issue needs attn from the UK Gov, but with their track record on the environment
in this country there is zero hope of that.
4362 2018-11-13 18:17:04 Did you know Customized essential oil remedies include multiple oils mixed together?
4363 2018-11-13 18:17:01 It is the cheapest, worst, obnoxious oil that is reducing the forests
4364 2018-11-13 18:16:59 If the shop is banning products with palm oil from its stored and wants to get this across and reasons why..surely it should be allowed.what about adverts 're smart meters entry savings, green issues etc and WWF adverts  raising funds 're loss of habitats for animals.
4365 2018-11-13 18:16:57 The Igennus Vegepa fish oil protocol works so well for many with CFS because it quickly restores omega 3 levels and balances the omega 3-6 ratio.
4366 2018-11-13 18:16:47 Trump/Zinke want to destroy historical records on endangered species,  marine conservation, oil and gas leases, mining, dams, critical habitats, land acquisitions, etc. These should be archived, not destroyed. Send protest to the National Archives.
4367 2018-11-13 18:16:34 When the dingos follow the bottle of oil, it is because they think bag of popcorn will be thrown into the parlor.
4368 2018-11-13 18:16:33 Oil changed. Now, it’s time to head to the bag.
4369 2018-11-13 18:16:20 No more cooking topless this oil almost burnt my future abs 
4370 2018-11-13 18:16:14 Oil is getting it in all three holes...yikes

Here are his thoughts on The Elite
4372 2018-11-13 18:16:10 Palm oil is not that bad though. It's not completely digestable and is not good for health in large quantities, but otherwise is harmless. Also contains vitamin A and some others
4373 2018-11-13 18:16:03 My mom changed my oil and filled up my tank:’-)
4374 2018-11-13 18:15:59 @Oreo seriously disappointed to discover you use palm oil  I for one will NOT be buying Oreos again unless you stop. And I love Oreos too!  But I love Orang-utans and our planet more!   #DropDirtyPalmOil
4375 2018-11-13 18:15:57 Expect more cuts- Ontario is broke - Canadian mass immigration will further add to the dismantling of various social welfare platforms and of course, since Liberals killed the oil sands and that revenue is lost - times will be hard and all Canadians will do with less - reality
4376 2018-11-13 18:15:55 Oil is fucking done...  gonna have a 4 handle tomorrow.
4377 2018-11-13 18:15:48 Today I experienced First Class frustration,like everything built around me was to frustrate me. 

You collected money to change the oil of a generator and decided not to, now generator has knocked. 
Nepa is not helping matters, those ones only give us light around 12pm.
4378 2018-11-13 18:15:46 Even without Operation Barbarossa it's hard to see how Germany ever was in a winning position without some other way of getting oil.
4379 2018-11-13 18:15:45 Was the use of a garden hose intentional to show a flare up? A standard A/B/C dry-chem extinguisher would do a better job on oil, correct?
4380 2018-11-13 18:15:38 Iraq and Syria one of the oldest inhabited regions in the world with archaeological finds dating the first human habitation at c. 700,000 years ago. Destroyed just for some oil.

4384 2018-11-13 18:15:31 The MD of the company gave me a bottle of olive oil today and I have no idea why
4385 2018-11-13 18:15:30 $AMRN must have slipped on some fish oil cuz it keeps sliding down.
4386 2018-11-13 18:15:24 But that report is 4 a Greatly Reduced need for oil seeing that the World is heading for a Major Recession & is being led by the US with a crash in 2020-21

Yes they changed the law so you don't have to be looking out for your investors first & your profits 2nd

Just don't lie
4387 2018-11-13 18:15:21 15 oil tankers use the same amount of fuel in a year as all the cars in NA, build the pipeline, stop buying oil from SA and you will have done more for the environment than your carbon TAX will ever do!

4391 2018-11-13 18:15:14 The article shows oil use declining...  same with coal... and renewables growing alot.  Why did you tweet this?

4399 2018-11-13 18:14:39 Sweat some onions in olive oil, add chopped garlic for the last minute, toss in Kale that has been chopped to forkable bites, Pour in chicken stock until it reaches about halfway up the kale. Put a cover on it. Cook until the stems are pleasant. Then take the lid off and reduce.
4400 2018-11-13 18:14:35 I exfoliated my face, wore 1 peel off mask and 1 wash off & lotioned with tea tree oil and baby lotion & my gaaaaawd my face feels amazing
4401 2018-11-13 18:14:30 I use a combination of Cocodamol (same strength as Migraleve), Naproxen (from GP) and CBD Oil for relaxation. The GP also prescribed an anti-sickness drug like the Buclizine in Migraleve. That JUST ABOUT helps. Migraleve is my wonder drug for 18 years. Hope somebody that helps x
4402 2018-11-13 18:14:24 Making a promise to myself to avoid all products containing palm oil from now on until its production doesn’t cause destruction, P.S orangoutangs are adorable AF
4403 2018-11-13 18:14:17 When Crude oil was trading at $86, I was thinking what Modi will do?
Now Crude is at $66 and I am thinking what Rahul Gandhi will do?

#nifty #crudeoil
4404 2018-11-13 18:14:16 Wrong - the greepeace film wasn’t approved and you knew already it breached rules. How many products will you continue to stock with palm oil? You’d be more credible if you withdrew them.
4405 2018-11-13 18:14:05 Indeed. I Hopefully, the importing countries shall reduce the taxes of oil imports?!.
4406 2018-11-13 18:14:00 Just reminds me of how my brother used to drench himself in baby oil when moisturising 
4407 2018-11-13 18:14:00 There's a great spice store where I live. For my moms birthday I grabbed like 40$ of spices based on what she cooked. Mostly general & Italian. Also picked up some great olive oil and local honey. You can get a lot of bang for your buck doing that and it makes a nice gift basket
4408 2018-11-13 18:13:50 I try stay away from linking present-moment market moves to my larger macro outlook but here we are regardless on the threshold of 2019, with massive market share changes taking place in global vehicle market.

Sharma ji oil is not going your way. This teaches us the lesson that nobody is astrologer, we all are guessing, sometimes we are right sometimes we are not. Nothing against you just an opinion.
4414 2018-11-13 18:13:36 My roots. Boiled plantain boiled eggs, sauteed Onions a little olive oil, lots of garlic, no salt.
4415 2018-11-13 18:13:30 #"Big coffee" tosses lots of meaningless words out. All crap, flavor is only in oil residue on can insides and that's all stale/rancid. Find bag coffees cheap and enjoy. I'll never go back, cowboys had better coffee! I've even roasted my own but green beans now hard to find.

4421 2018-11-13 18:13:16 It's not so much a distaste for all corporations indiscriminately, but rather we understand that for most, the ultimate goal is making a maximum profit. Cutting corners is a major policy for many companies. Look to oil companies and see how they try to avoid safety regs.

4436 2018-11-13 18:12:20 Gender quotas for primary school teacher. Must be 50-50. As well as brick layers, oil workers, lumberjacks, tunnel drillers, soldiers, plumbers, crane drivers.
4437 2018-11-13 18:12:17 I never knew what palm oil was until I watched the Iceland Christmas advert, it’s spreading awareness and making lots of people think twice about the foods they buy that contain palm oil. Very effective.

4444 2018-11-13 18:11:48 The ad was made for crass pr on the back of Greenpeace investment. If Iceland donated the cost of making and distributing the film to Greenpeace and banned all palm oil product I’d be more impressed. Remember this is the company that tried to pass off horse meat as beef
4445 2018-11-13 18:11:32 You should look at how many tankers bring crude into Vancouver.  Or barges that come up from Washington or oil tankers coming from Alaska to Washington.  #beinformed
4446 2018-11-13 18:11:27 The thing with palm oil is that it can only be grown on tropical lands, so its expansion had been the major factor of deforestation in Indonesia and Malaysia. Sunflower, canola, etc, don't suffer from that problem. This is why PO is a major driver of deforestation.
4447 2018-11-13 18:11:23 Yeah the one I have is sugar too! I’ll have to try making the honey and sugar mix it sounds like an amazing combo  i guess you could add some scented oil or something but the money and sugar should smell amazing on it own 
4448 2018-11-13 18:11:16 Maybe but the FDA knew and agreed to the use of the oil and even if you walk back the data a few % nothing comes close

Well, oil prices have now DROPPED a record 12 days in a row. This has never happened before in history.

4458 2018-11-13 18:10:53 Awesome decision "Oil Tot". It's best to hear other people cry about what broke so you know what to expect to avoid you crying over a loss as well. As you are very much aware what a patch adds a patch breaks. So stay tuned!

4478 2018-11-13 18:09:37 Demonstrations are fine.. but plans of action are even better. Getting initiatives on your state ballot and voting for them. Jayapal has done. Perhaps an overview of how big oil companies fighting back. And how to WIN against them next time!

As someone said in class:  "You can't beat the bang for the buck; best investment I ever made" in re @Market_Scholars.
4483 2018-11-13 18:09:18 Markets this year: if something is oversold, it will get way more oversold before bottoming; if something is overbought, it will get way more overbought before topping. Two examples: oil and Brazil, but really applies to most markets.

4492 2018-11-13 18:08:13 Of course, you avoid it as much as you can. If you read labels, you'll start to find many cheap products that don't have palm oil. I can't avoid it on vegetable spreads ("butters"), for instance, but it's easy to avoid it on chips and other stuff.
4493 2018-11-13 18:07:43 Brother just started his new job on a commercial crab boat so i gotta make sure the oil is in stock & take care of payroll for my pop’s shop. Rip me! I’m fuckin dead 
4494 2018-11-13 18:07:41 If Salman want to stay in power, pump oil like it’s going out of style.
4495 2018-11-13 18:07:36 It was a Greenpeace commissioned film that wasn’t approved. It was Iceland that engaged in a crass campaign for very cheap PR. How many of your products contained palm oil. How many other brand products that contain palm oil will you still sell (so much for principles)?
4496 2018-11-13 18:07:23 Demand for oil still growing. If continued we need more. However you're right about frying the planet.  Stones still in demand since stone age. Only way demand will fall is price and cheaper alternatives.  Another oil shock ahead.
4497 2018-11-13 18:07:21 Hi Chelle. We're committed to honest and transparent labelling.  We were the first British supermarket to identify palm oil rather than ‘vegetable oil’ on the labels of all fresh and chilled food...1/2
4498 2018-11-13 18:07:19 Just tell us you can do an oil change and go lmao we believe you!!
4499 2018-11-13 18:07:12 Difference is they run out of money, we make fucking loads of it but we have scammers as owners.

Why cheat? Surely Pep's good enough eh?

4506 2018-11-13 18:06:59 You are too kind. I probably shouldn't be let off so easily. I stayed at the resource-scarcity party just long enough to become "too-long." But yes, concerns about there being enough oil, decline from existing fields, and especially oil affordability are all now moot. Cheers.

4516 2018-11-13 18:06:22 @RaoulGMI thinks oil is preparing for a serious move down (based on technicals). Maybe even to sub $40 levels. What a disruption that would be!
4517 2018-11-13 18:06:19 @NutellaGlobal you say you're Palm oil free now... do you not realise that vegetable oil contains Palm oil which is plastered all over your ingredients. If you claim to be free from... stop using Palm oil..... #PalmOil #stop
4518 2018-11-13 18:06:18 There are several factors that can increase the risk of an oil tank and/or oil line leak. This includes the age of the tank, the quality of the installation work, and the condition of the soil (wet and clay soils promote rust and thus tank leaks).

4538 2018-11-13 18:04:09 How much of China opening up oil derivatives is causing this?  We all know managed money was very net long but is the unwinding being exaggerated due to China oil derivatives opening up?
4539 2018-11-13 18:04:05 1/ No, it doesn't.  That's post-71 western thinking.  It only requires taking advantage of western paper mkts to create different ratio than what highly levered deriv mkts do.  China could do this tomorrow.

4550 2018-11-13 18:02:43 Dam i need an oil change
4551 2018-11-13 18:02:36 Doug do you see the price of oil as leading indicator for the economy?

4553 2018-11-13 18:02:31 Any chance of residents and business access to Waterloo Rd from Oil St, instead of adding to the Paisley St communter carnage? @lpoolcouncil
4554 2018-11-13 18:02:31 If I go to my dealership for one of my free oil changes I got when I bought the car, I’ll turn 65 waiting in the custlmer lounge for them to do it.
4555 2018-11-13 18:02:28 #krisonomics

The price of crude oil is precisely 0, God provides it for free.

The price for EXTRACTING oil is above 0.

Get it?
4556 2018-11-13 18:02:12 Question? Is the tension in Turkey a result of economic derivatives or about oil supply through turkey, back driven with US sediment? And should we be long on EU banks?
4557 2018-11-13 18:02:02 All purchases of oil from one country to another that is a net importer shows those sales with tax receipts.  The data has diverged since Sept 2018.  Spread is largest in 8 years.
4558 2018-11-13 18:01:59 Explain why we should sit on our hands and let the Earth burn while politicians are being paid to ignore the damage done by oil & gas. How about those politicians unite with the people, the scientists and Earth?
4559 2018-11-13 18:01:56 I love my oil diffuser I wish I could just put it my pocket and take it everywhere
4560 2018-11-13 18:01:53 @Paul_engytrd Incredible this oil... This is looking like it will not stop falling. I am just going to see how the week finishes but for sure there are a lot of easier things out there to trade.

4562 2018-11-13 18:01:46 I like to think I’m a forgiving person but then I remember I still won’t go to bp because of the oil spill that happened in 2010 so maybe not
4563 2018-11-13 18:01:42 Ok. Looting looting looting!!! No tots on the level of insecurity caused by herdsmen, poverty rate even though oil only dropped by 30%.
4564 2018-11-13 18:01:38 Dubai discovered oil in 1966, an estimated 4billion barrels in reserves. Nigeria discovered oil in 1956, an estimated 37 billion barrels in reserves. Pls, izit not d same oil we discovered?  abi vegetable oil we find?
4565 2018-11-13 18:01:35 Can we have our chocolate company back off those cut throat bastards basically. The brand is in ruins, I could not buy anything from them if this is the case ref palm oil
4566 2018-11-13 18:01:32 Yes indeed. It's been a remarkably successful campaign either way — I've now seen news stories attacking Cadburys for not ditching palm oil, and I'd be surprised if Iceland doesn't see an increase in shoppers — 'ethical but cash conscious' seems a big under-served market.
4567 2018-11-13 18:01:19 It’s all about degrees. 

Lotion that has coconut oil in it isn’t created like, say, eggs in mayonnaise where they predominate—though it is a major component. It’s suspended in and mediated by other ingredients. 

This is a good, light lotion that allows layering.
4568 2018-11-13 18:01:18 @Cheryautos Guys, could you share the Oil specs  for Chery Beat X1, Chery Arauca and Orino, I'm writing from Venezuela, Thanks
4569 2018-11-13 18:01:14 They gotta let that dog go quick. Oil prices spiked up, but dropped precipitously in the recent days.

4571 2018-11-13 18:01:10 Democrats recently reversed pledge to take no Big Oil PAC money which was merely symbolic as they did not refuse Super PAC dark money

4572 2018-11-13 18:01:05 Did you know that some types of oil can cause a small decrease in fuel economy – while other types can help to maximize fuel economy? If you are interested in finding the right oil to optimize your vehicle’s fuel economy, we can help.
4573 2018-11-13 18:01:00 Come on guys and gals, Puj is asking for some feedback. Clicking the heart icon doesn't answer a question. It just says you read it. Help Puj out and lets make the wheel spin again lol. He had to oil the wheel the other day from all the spinning. :)
4574 2018-11-13 18:00:55 You do know that actually happened, right? The operative word is OLIGARCHS. Like #kochbrothers.  The billionaire oil, banking, and weapons pimps who sell death while paranoid fools like you do everything you can to distract from the people from the corrupt @GOP.
4575 2018-11-13 18:00:51 Can you get @WhittakersNZ over there? 

Well worth it if you can, and clear of palm oil.
4576 2018-11-13 18:00:42 haha, its a strat i use in grains, but sometimes you get crazy shit like this in oil, need a bias to play it of course, but i think given the washout we could make this area the new middle

4578 2018-11-13 18:00:39 Ken Hersh on eSports revenue growth: When you're a builder, there's always going to be a J-curve...it takes time to develop. "I came from the oil and gas business, so I'm accustomed to losing money on a cash flow basis." #sbjesports
4579 2018-11-13 18:00:38 Iran has massive amounts of oil.  The money flow was definitely cut off for other reasons.  They no longer have the ability to send or receive money to fund terrorism, weaponry or human trafficking.  I firmly believe Iran was being paid by the Cabal to house OBL. He is not dead.
4580 2018-11-13 18:00:33 Palm oil certification body @RSPOtweets will only be credible if its #palmoil growers like @Indofood eradicate exploitation, deforestation & destruction of ecologically precious peatland from plantations. They must use this weeks’ P&C vote well! #RT16 #RSPO
4581 2018-11-13 18:00:30 I believe you're thinking of oil lobbyists @FraserInstitute. 
OSF gets its money from Soros' history as a market speculator, not big oil. Focuses on human rights cases, drug policy reform, scholarships, promoting democracy in East Europe, and infectious disease research. #cdnpoli

4583 2018-11-13 18:00:28 Crude oil futures are now down for the 12th straight day.

In all my data (which may be crap), the longest streak before this I could find was 10 straight days, ending Aug 31, 1984.

The next two days, oil rallied +5.3%
4584 2018-11-13 18:00:17 Any bets oil is down 10 -15% tomorrow?
4585 2018-11-13 18:00:15 You can find a demonstration of Rick Simpson making the oil. Try you tube.

4588 2018-11-13 17:59:53 RT to pressure @RSPOtweets, the #palmoil industry's self-proclaimed regulator to protect the #planet, #animals and #workers from destructive palm oil companies. It’s time it updated its rules to make palm oil truly sustainable #RSPO #RT16 @recordrackennis
4589 2018-11-13 17:59:52 Ok hear me out though. Most tahini in the US is terrible and makes hummus taste bad. Adding avo instead of/in addition to tahini gives you that lovely creamy texture without gross bitterness. (Tho so does extra olive oil -  is a sometimes thing)
4590 2018-11-13 17:59:49 ROTFLMAO, looks like he is long oil short NG
4591 2018-11-13 17:59:40 You can still find some that does not have sugar on it. Must read everything. Added vegetables oil too. It's one or two brands, but exists. Bring your glasses to the supermarket people lol
4592 2018-11-13 17:59:38 I feel like people are putting more effort into getting the anti-palm oil ad back on the TV more they ever have trying to stop the use of palm oil altogether. 

 Weird world #IcelandAdvert
4593 2018-11-13 17:59:38 @realDonaldTrump why are you purposely trying to kill domestic oil???
4594 2018-11-13 17:59:14 @FredKrupp says best bang for buck to reduce climate risk is reduce methane emissions. Banks should require 24/7 ground level methane monitoring on all oil & gas deals to ensure minimal methane leaks .#GSSFI

Biggest thing is most people shave after a month, but it usually takes 2-3 for facial hair to turn from scraggly to intentional.

Beard oil & other products work wonders once it's full too.
4604 2018-11-13 17:58:49 Tak sesuai la tu. Maybe boleh try some oils? Bio oil or olive oil or coconut oil.
4605 2018-11-13 17:58:38 The problem is how you get to that spec. The components used this is different is blending Gasoil and Fuel oil which create stability and compatability issues and would not fulfill the spec. Not just about the sulphur also about the composition of the blending components
4606 2018-11-13 17:58:31 no news, oil and panic selling, heard west face is selling the position
4607 2018-11-13 17:58:31 So, we’re not even using our own gas or oil It’s being sold to other Countries and Billionaires are profiting not us.
4608 2018-11-13 17:58:28 honestly: i think it's not all just about #fracking. shale gas is just one very intense form of oil & gas development. there are many more like that. when you look what's going on in the #tarsands or in offshore #deepwater, it's also pretty risky and/or has high impacts. 1/

4613 2018-11-13 17:57:52 Good catch Dr. Anas .. also the shale industry and the required infrastructure all need higher #oil prices
4614 2018-11-13 17:57:51 @Oreo As long as you have palm oil in your products, I will no longer buy them.  If you cannot make cookies without palm oil, I will never purchase or eat your products again.
4615 2018-11-13 17:57:44 Ok really concerned about the amount of products that contain Palm oil - this is shocking

4622 2018-11-13 17:57:05 I didn't see his specific targets, but I agree that the issue in crude oil isn't supply. The issue is demand as it always is at the start of a crude oil bear market. His numbers portend a recession similar to '08.
4623 2018-11-13 17:57:01 The #Oil Market is still relatively in a state of balance and there is no cause for alarm.
4624 2018-11-13 17:56:31 @GarethSoloway Oil reminds me of GE during this options ex week. Everyone is talking oil down and selling. The opposite will happen soon. Oil is a no-brainer. Just need to stick it out during these games.

4639 2018-11-13 17:53:55 The concept that gas has a role to play in diminishing emissions by replacing oil/coal combustion is controversial. It depends on the rate at which alternatives arise. If they can't replace oil/coal fast enough then the gas equation works. So far they struggle but one to watch.
4640 2018-11-13 17:53:53 I believe can be labelled as “Veg oil” but I’d stand corrected if that’s changed.
4641 2018-11-13 17:53:48 Value-add products do cost more to produce per gram so yes an all oil manufacturer will have higher costs/gram than a pure flower LP. I'll put together a gross margin/gram chart in the future to capture product differences.
4642 2018-11-13 17:53:46 Oh bollocks, they still sell +200 products made from "palm oil" honestly do yourself a favour & read @piersmorgan responses on Twitter as @IcelandRichard stated "we are still a business, to make profit" hypocrisy....

4657 2018-11-13 17:52:30 There is always going to be a need for oil don’t fool yourself, so why not Canada benefiting? We do oil and gas drilling probably some of the most environmentally friendly in the world,if you seen drilling in Middle East u would be shocked. So why is Canada getting oil from there
4658 2018-11-13 17:52:28 @Lindt isn’t it time you removed palm oil from your products?!? #saynotopalmoil
4659 2018-11-13 17:52:06 Greenpeace making it makes it even more of a virtue signalling con by #iceland #IcelandChristmasAdvert to promote their palm oil policy. Everyone is being taken for a ride.

4665 2018-11-13 17:51:30 @theresa_may will the UK be following the EU’s lead and banning palm oil?
4666 2018-11-13 17:51:24 Exactly. And this is just what the oil business and big Ag want - to lurk in the shadows out of the spotlight!

4683 2018-11-13 17:50:05 RT to pressure @RSPOtweets, the #palmoil industry's self-proclaimed regulator to protect the #planet, #animals and #workers from destructive palm oil companies. It’s time it updated its rules to make palm oil truly sustainable #RSPO #RT16
4684 2018-11-13 17:49:55 .@KinderBuenoUK isn’t it time you removed palm oil from your products? #saynotopalmoil
4685 2018-11-13 17:49:51 Lets mentor all our boys and girls and stop handicapping them with a message of division like oil and water.  We were made to mix together, after all
4686 2018-11-13 17:49:38 @Asad_Umar : How about introducing Ethanol-Gasoline blend fuel in Pakistan? E-10 does not even require a converter. The higher E-80 requires one in an ordinary gasoline powered car. Surely we can utilise the molasses and baggases and cut down on imports of crude oil.

4692 2018-11-13 17:49:05 Global Markets Rebound On Renewed Trade Hopes, Oil Slides For Record 12th Day
 
After Monday's vicious Veteran's Day selloff, which took place with the cash bond market closed, world markets have regained their footing as European stocks and S&P 500 futures modestly higher.
4693 2018-11-13 17:48:59 Dead light bulb (or oil) bounce for $GE? Up 10% on plan to sell stake in $BHGE? Hmm. Seems a bit much, no?
4694 2018-11-13 17:48:50 Sure. Buy my oil and gas reserves, then do what you want with them. But anyone who would destroy my wealth is as surely my enemy as any military opponent ever could be.
4695 2018-11-13 17:48:45 Considering who backed her from the beginning, Old Snake Oil Salesman Sanders himself, is there any wonder?
4696 2018-11-13 17:48:43 I was at Joshua’s house ALL DAY yesterday and not once did I think to ask him to change the oil on my car. Wow.
4697 2018-11-13 17:48:42 I find it hard to believe, didn't the attacks on the eastern oil fields of Omar start only after SDF pulled back from Baghuz and the salt flats?
IMO such an operation is pointless without containing them in the valley.
Oh, and do you know if they left Kishma oil field as well?
4698 2018-11-13 17:48:37 and look out for sustainable palm oil labels!
4699 2018-11-13 17:48:31 I would call it, anticipated value rather than speculation. That's how it goes. If you were to travel back in time, wouldn't you buy all the land over oil reserves knowing how important oil will become. Those who know, know.
4700 2018-11-13 17:48:28 Fish oil n dog food do it quick believe me
4701 2018-11-13 17:48:25 Albolene, a makeup remover, is amazing and recommended for jerking alone. It is oil based and not for penetrative sex. J-lube is another good option. Make in small batches and a bottle will last a long time. Everything else is too expensive or is best saved for use with another.
4702 2018-11-13 17:48:20 And you do good work. My original reply was not to you, but to a blatant PR video jumping on the Iceland palm oil band waggon. Conservation should be noble and not mislead.
4703 2018-11-13 17:48:17 It’s hugely difficult to avoid palm oil, it’s in thousands of products- food, toiletries, cleaning products, fuel. And it’s often not specifically labelled as palm oil either, sometimes just vegetable oil!
4704 2018-11-13 17:48:17 Oil demand forecasted to rise another 15-20 mmbpd by 2040....  we could be a big part of that!
4705 2018-11-13 17:48:16 the closet gay thing may have been awkward for AZ. 
no one admits to that kind of discomfort with a candidate but it can play a role in voter apathy towards her in the privacy of a voting booth, or a write-in ballot. both candidates are gay/bisexual. the one who admits it won.
4706 2018-11-13 17:48:14 It’s pronounced oll not oil. Fight me.
4707 2018-11-13 17:48:13 Good Luck @SheaRacing ! kick-butt & have fun!

4721 2018-11-13 17:46:51 Oil is the best there is, it is used for so much more than fuel! Do you actually think a country cover in solar panels is attractive, or a coast line fill with windmills surrounded by dead birds and a coastline covered with raw sewage is better
4722 2018-11-13 17:46:51 Its too fkn early to pick fights with me about when a coupon expired. That shit expired in June bruh. Pay me the 40 bucks for the fkn oil change and be on your way smh 
4723 2018-11-13 17:46:51 @RichieAllenShow is it Israels close proximity to all the oil rich countries in the Middle East which gives it so much power strategically for the West?

4727 2018-11-13 17:46:30 If you care about the deforestation, habitat loss and species extinction caused by palm oil, do you also care about the deforestation, habitat loss and species extinction caused by animal agriculture?
4728 2018-11-13 17:46:23 Today, I told my doctor to cease my repeat prescriptions for the following

Pregabalin 

IBS:
Alverine Citrate

All because CBD Oil has stopped me needing to take them.

4734 2018-11-13 17:45:58 2/ Pricing oil & gold in CNY allows them, if they wish, to control the int'l trade value of USD via oil/gold flows.  IE: If PBOC sees current acct getting dangerously close to deficit (bad), they can adjust gold/oil ratio they'll settle at, above ratio of COMEX/NYMEX gold/oil.

4739 2018-11-13 17:45:16 To all those complaining about the 11 day oil losing streak, consider yourself lucky.  This organized collapse allowed bulls to exit their positions with limited damage. Next time do not ignore the fundamentals. #oott

4742 2018-11-13 17:45:03 @Morrisons what is your stance on #PalmOil Are you going to use Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) in all your products?
4743 2018-11-13 17:45:00 At the time, as I recall, Waldegrave admitted in the house that the books showed a surplus of £27b flowing from Scotland to the rUK over the 80s and early 90s.

Should we instead have stuck most of that in an oil fund à la Norway?
4744 2018-11-13 17:44:57 As a so-called businessman, you should understand the laws of supply & demand. Those that have oil, will keep supply down so the demand is high, therefore higher profits. Idiot

4746 2018-11-13 17:44:52 @Flora do you use Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) in your products? #PalmOil
4747 2018-11-13 17:44:49 Yes, you are a lier. 
Twisting words to suit your agenda. 
"resource industries " does Not equal "oil companies ".
4748 2018-11-13 17:44:46 Yes, much better to let oil companies keep wrecking the planet. Great plan! Also, can you remind us where your funding comes from? #IndustryPawn
4749 2018-11-13 17:44:36 In order for the #EU to protect itself against the Russian army it will need fuels, oil and natural gas, to mobilize. It’s population will need them to survive. Russia not selling. America not siding?

Instead of buying cooking spray all the time, invest in a oil-sprayer. It's basically the same thing as the spray cans, except you can refill it with whatever oil you prefer.
4754 2018-11-13 17:44:04 OK.  Walk the plank! Next time send me a DM. "James short some oil quick."
4755 2018-11-13 17:43:59 This is why we haven't purchased any products containing palm oil for many years. #saynotopalmoil
Manufacturers will only start to listen when we stop buying their products
4756 2018-11-13 17:43:58 OK. Next time send me a DM. "James short some oil quick."
4757 2018-11-13 17:43:56 @CadburyUK  could you please let me know your stance on sourcing sustainable palm oil within your products? My 7 year old daughter would like to know, looking forward to your response

4762 2018-11-13 17:43:48 I have a really good relationship with the shuttle driver at the Toyota dealership I get my oil change at.  I called and he was "oh man, I just left" me, "yeah I know, their phones are down so I was told to call" driver, "oh, is this the tall guy?" Me, "yeah" "I'll be right over"
4763 2018-11-13 17:43:44 It's a Dutch chemical/oil storage company or something. Not one likely to come up in the pub quiz..
4764 2018-11-13 17:43:40 @AldiUK may I ask about the palm oil used in your products? We often shop with you but have come to realise how much palm oil is used this could be bad for the forests and its inhabitants 
#savetheforests if not ethically sourced.
4765 2018-11-13 17:43:37 Our focus is to stop deforestation and biodiversity loss for oil palm. Not to support an industry. It hasn't been easy and we still have a long way to go, but unless brands and retailers source sustainable palm oil, the industry will revert to business-as-usual.
4766 2018-11-13 17:43:33 I really wish you could read. If so you might understand that their are things we pay for that have indirect benefits. You might also understand that our influence comes from how we spend money. You should end the true handouts-like oil subsidies. You are an idiot. #resign

4779 2018-11-13 17:42:46 Come on. Do you drive a car or use gas? We need to support the transition to Renewables as fast as possible. Oil companies will likely become energy companies that also have renewable division, as we legislate incentives for transition. But, it can't be done overnight.

4781 2018-11-13 17:42:21 I'm sorry also.
It was on the science channel that the landscape in Cali contains a natural oil that burns really easy.

4782 2018-11-13 17:42:18 At the pace oil keeps on going down I will be happy if we just do not crash sub 55 this week.
4783 2018-11-13 17:42:05 Naw, you give people too much credit. They dislike Vegans because they're different from established norms.

4788 2018-11-13 17:41:13 Don't regret it it's not your fault but don't make out sustainable palm oil is something we should all feel happy to support. Yes it's the less of two evils but to promote it as a sustainable product us misleading
4789 2018-11-13 17:41:09 Im going to get my oil changed in black sweats and a white tee. Pull up ladies

4793 2018-11-13 17:40:47 Oh sweet Andy, it wasn’t for oil. The US propped up authoritarian regimes to halt communism. They were a bunch of proxy wars as part of the Cold War. Basic facts, mate.

4803 2018-11-13 17:39:55 When you consider China has what, 5 times the population of the US.  Electricity is "stored" in Coal, oil, natural gas, wind, water, etc.  ALL of which are Solar in origin.  All power is Solar except nuclear power.  #solarenergy
4804 2018-11-13 17:39:50 The important point is that #Oil is stealth QE for a fragile economy.
4805 2018-11-13 17:39:42 Urgent vote to transform the destructive #palmoil industry from within: RT to demand that members of @RSPOtweets vote to improve principles & criteria, so palm oil companies stop exploiting people & land #RSPO #RT16
4806 2018-11-13 17:39:41 "Health professionals" like the ones who took a big payout from the soybean industry and then said canola and vegetable oil were healthier? Or the Harvard doctor who is on the record for suppressing research he thinks disagrees w/ nutritional orthodoxy?

4817 2018-11-13 17:38:46 You seem to be confirming the story and calling it fake in the same tweet. You really do sell snake oil.

4819 2018-11-13 17:38:41 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.

4826 2018-11-13 17:38:20 Raoul is so right. US no a big oil and gas producer and an ever increasing % of ISM.

4837 2018-11-13 17:37:16 Current pipeline capacity is wasted by the diluent portion of dilbit.  Refine it here and there would be plenty of capacity.

And Canada doesn't sell to the US.  Oil companies sell to other oil companies (often themselves). Canadian oil already has tidewater access, it's via US.
4838 2018-11-13 17:37:12 Piers morgan was "interviewing" the ceo of Iceland about palm oil and managed to get a dig in about vegans, what is wrong with the man????
4839 2018-11-13 17:37:10 Find my earlier tweet on in region resolution.
You do know "looking after them" does NOT mean  think they're suffering, right...?! Again, IN REGION HELP is what was neded from day 1, INC USA, that created most of this going back to the 80s oil warmongering...

4841 2018-11-13 17:37:06 From now on I’m gonna check if products I’m buying are containing palm oil or not although it’s virtually in everything if i can i wanna reduce the amount I’m buying 
4842 2018-11-13 17:37:04 Is the douche bottle filled with crude oil?
4843 2018-11-13 17:36:47 Idk how many times I have to say that to people lmao. Yeah you can use the VS stuff every once in a while but cocoa butter, coconut oil, Shea butter, type lotions are what your body really needs.
4844 2018-11-13 17:36:30 Taxes on fuel "to fight climate change" are paid by the end user. Oil companies collect it and pass it to the government @robrousseau

4854 2018-11-13 17:35:35 I’m under the impression that it’s an economic/geopolitical reality that US will reduce its presence overseas. 

We don’t need middle eastern oil anymore. We have no political will to continue wars over there. Our only future interest there is an attachment to Israel.
4855 2018-11-13 17:35:32 This is a great idea--mentoring is the oil that makes the machine function, but it is not recognized, rewarded, or even viewed positively. I'd even say, sometimes it's punished.
4856 2018-11-13 17:35:32 Hmm, the usual categories are:-
Spirit Bling - gold leaf, diamonds, unobtanium etc
or
Snake Oil - vitamins, collagen, aphrodisiac etc
or
Fatuous Flavours - Icelandic Moss, Unicorn Tears, Quavers etc
4857 2018-11-13 17:35:25 #Crude oil at 10 month lowest price $57.5 , it's time to find the best fit for the #Government or for the people of #Pakistan.

4858 2018-11-13 17:35:15 He doesn't know how too, he always delegated and took the credit for success but never ever for failure. Failure is always, always someone else's fault.
He is a CONARTIST, a snake oil salesman and uneducated folks fall for it, which is really sad for our country.

So she gets a small honourarium for speaking engagements to cover costs. 
And resource sector does not equal oil and gas companies. 
Suzuki is paid a minimum of 30k to speak at events, more than enough to cover his costs. He also charges admission. 
Vivian doesnt.

4866 2018-11-13 17:34:40 I know this working in the oil patch that the amount of sand and water needed up in Fort Nelson was drying up certain water reservoirs as well there was a plan to build train tracks to an area east of Fort Nelson to transport the sand  a lot goes into fracking yes
4867 2018-11-13 17:34:39 If they are big I halve them, if not I just leave them whole, toss them in olive oil and black pepper and roast for about 20-25 minutes. Very simple!

4869 2018-11-13 17:34:33 Sorry babe. Castor oil and some wine will do the trick.
4870 2018-11-13 17:34:27 That @IPCC_CH snake oil sales routine scam has taken too many of the scientifically illiterate. 
4871 2018-11-13 17:34:26 You may want to ask some police or military personnel how 'respectful' Obama was toward them and the invaluable, stressful and dangerous work they do. Check with some coal miners and oil workers while you're at it, too.
4872 2018-11-13 17:34:20 I know that juice be getting expensive out there. But shhhieeeet, if it ain’t sealed somebody prolly whacked it with vegetable oil anyway.. pour one out for @ASAPYams DAY!!!

4874 2018-11-13 17:34:07 Do I have to say “no homo” each time I moisturise my skin with coconut oil?
4875 2018-11-13 17:33:52 @Greenpeace Do you your thing...oh wait??.what??..that's not your thing??..oh ..its not Canadian oil...oh I see..
4876 2018-11-13 17:33:47 If you got dry lips just do this simple trick. Rinse them thoroughly with water, put a lot and I mean A LOT of lipbalm(or cocnut oil) and leave it for like 10 minutes. Then take a toothbrush and gently scrub your crusty ass lips to get rid of the dead skin. Notice the difference?
4877 2018-11-13 17:33:44 In a Nigeria, a ship loaded with oil went missing, a satellite disappeared into thin air, 10 dead people were appointed as Heads of Boards by the President, the National Budget was alleged to be missing, a "snake swallowed N36 m" and "a monkey swallowed N70m". What a country.
4878 2018-11-13 17:33:31 But if you took it the first time they should have got your info and what oil so lowkey that’s still on you
4879 2018-11-13 17:33:28 Have you tried c.b.d oil. I've heard great things about it. And think you could benefit from it.
4880 2018-11-13 17:33:26 Great information. The Oil Sands are a natural pollution disaster.  Minning it and the subsequent  environmental reclamation leaves the site cleaner than before.
Enviromentalists are deceiving us or are ignorant of the facts
4881 2018-11-13 17:33:24 When we see your products stickered as sustainable or palm oil free we'll (family of five) start using your products again. BTW my 9 year old son is leading the ban on palm oil products in our house. #thefuture
4882 2018-11-13 17:33:23 Remind me to never get smash fries from smash burger again. They just dump a bunch of oil on the fries and throw the fries in the bag upside down so that everything is soaked through the bag
4883 2018-11-13 17:33:21 Why not?  Why wouldn't they want to be able to harvest in the future?  Do the costs outweigh the benefits, thus indicating the waste of some other resource to harvest palm oil more sustainably?  Why are consumer habits providing such incentives...what else is going on?
4884 2018-11-13 17:33:12 We hear you. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years.  We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.

4889 2018-11-13 17:32:47 In Arizona Sinema was selling snake oil. She portrayed herself as middle of the road when she is a far left progressive akin to California.
4890 2018-11-13 17:32:45 Bold! Maybe they can get identify some possible causes of changing climate!!

Let’s all wait patiently while they research whether any scientists have studied climate.

4895 2018-11-13 17:32:27 Baby I would suck on them and kiss them softly and rub baby oil all over them making them soft and smooth and I would continue to kiss them and suck on them after I was done and maybe I would have you give me the best motorboat ever 
4896 2018-11-13 17:32:23 Saudi Arabia as state sponsor of terrorism - who cares?  They have oil.  We play the relationship game.  Are you suddently interested in human rights?  Check the US border where children are imprisoned and separated from parents.

4898 2018-11-13 17:32:08 Why are we assholes for pointing out that you wrote a baseless hit piece based on a mineral oil canard so hedge funds who sold calls can have them expire worthless on Friday?
4899 2018-11-13 17:32:03 No matter what Sauds said. USA has a project depending on low oil prices and that matters only.
4900 2018-11-13 17:31:55 I will say a nice moisturizing oil for everyday use is Tarte’s Maracuja Oil. I use it daily and I have super sensitive skin. It’s effective and wonderful. As for a cleanser, I use Liquid Neutrogena Facial Cleanser. It’s good for my skin and doesn’t strip it.

4912 2018-11-13 17:30:54 Most marinades are oil based. It's just a matter of what oil they are using. I'm guessing price is the main factor. My question about sustainable palm oil is if its used globally on such a scale, can it really be sustainable?
4913 2018-11-13 17:30:49 Not at all. Trump is well aware of this and had to prioritize what was to be dealt with first. He’s already increased the GDP by 4.2% then 3.5%, has increased oil/nat gas production with their exportation, he’s renegotiated trade deals bc of their tariffs and unfair practices on
4914 2018-11-13 17:30:42 Rather than present an argument about palm oil v veg oil or any other oil, how about complete transparency from producers and retailers - where it was sourced, the names of the people involved and how much they were paid etc.
4915 2018-11-13 17:30:38 use a moisturizer to help lock in the oil! I have one from Belif that I've repurchased over 10 times because it keeps my skin from drying out and breaking out.

4924 2018-11-13 17:29:55 Reminds me of 20 years ago when groups were trying to outlaw movie popcorn because it had deadly evil coconut oil. Even if it was bad, how much movie popcorn does a person eat in their life?

Are restaurant milkshakes anyone's staple food?

4928 2018-11-13 17:29:41 @honeywell I tipped over my electric oil radiator and it has t worked since. I have jostled it around and let it sit for a day and still nothing. What can I do for warranty?
4929 2018-11-13 17:29:39 I was short oil with $65 puts. They’ve done well since last month. But I’m referring to the trade tensions taking place now. There’s real risk to oil upside in 2019 as managed money has unwound most of the net long built up.  The curve can flip back into backwardation.

4932 2018-11-13 17:29:15 8% unemployment, yet the highest number of employed people ever in the province. This is what happens when your economy attracts more people than it can employ. The oil revenue is lost b/c they can’t get it to market, something cons did nothing about for decades.

4939 2018-11-13 17:28:48 That's just how it was. Americans now feel superiorly invincible and have little common sense but sure it went well. Wars may divide us but oil and gas will destroy us. Financially and environmentally.

4943 2018-11-13 17:28:31 So the Iceland “ad” is actually a Green Peace video and altho Iceland products now don’t contain palm oil, they still sell lots of products that do. Can’t help feeling a bit cynical about the PR behind this.

4948 2018-11-13 17:28:14 Thank you for that clarification. I did wonder where the palm oil would fit into the process. The article I read is obviously trying to put people off certain brands!  Best go celebrate this amazing news with a Jd and coke 
4949 2018-11-13 17:28:13 He ate all my fucking coconut oil
4950 2018-11-13 17:28:11 Well that's just corporate responsibility, no? Everyone tapping into the same resource for a short-term self-serving profit is exactly what the tragedy of the commons is. Palm oil can be harvested sustainability, it's just that socially irresponsible corporations won't do it
4951 2018-11-13 17:28:10 This is an environmental issue NOT a political point. It's a message that needs to be screened. How many other ads of this typed have you stopped. We all know Palm oil is big money is that the real truth don't want to upset the investors?
4952 2018-11-13 17:27:58 un split des activités, comme pour google, facebook, ce serait une bonne idée... même pour les boites en question je crois. L'explosion de la Stadard Oil à finalement bénéficié à Rockfeller.
4953 2018-11-13 17:27:57 
4954 2018-11-13 17:27:49 Yet some snake oil salesman convinced #HamOnt city councillors to spend $100,000 to create a video for Amazon when Hamilton met none of the criteria.

Hamilton needs to investigate this. 

Who benefited from the $100k & what political ties do they have, if any?

4955 2018-11-13 17:27:49 Keep a glass of coconut oil not what you get in shops here.. get some fresh ones from ooru.. apply it daily it's good.. keeps the joints stronger too..
4956 2018-11-13 17:27:47 かわいい
4957 2018-11-13 17:27:41 It would be temporary in nature and is always the risk shorting oil. Use options.
4958 2018-11-13 17:27:30 Its been 2 hours. For a damn oil change 
4959 2018-11-13 17:27:26 China & India are the largest consumers of palm oil.
It's in everything we buy now & even being disguised as vegetable oil in some products
4960 2018-11-13 17:27:23 Castor oil helps with that
4961 2018-11-13 17:27:14 Global demand is quite strong. Looking at physical markets, esp India and China imports. I think we will have oil in triple digits in 2019.
4962 2018-11-13 17:27:13 Gaza is on fire now from the bombs. It's a good thing oil prices are so low there's going to be increased demand on it now. Oh and sanctions are being placed on Iran, well shame on them for producing so much oil and selling it for anything but dollars.
4963 2018-11-13 17:27:12 That edible & coconut oil had us threw last night 
4964 2018-11-13 17:27:06 this man told me if I rate him good on this survey i’ll get free gas or a free oil change say mf less
4965 2018-11-13 17:26:58 Wobblier, I think.  NV with a dose of suburban TX thrown in.  Or TX without all of the oil and gas country.
4966 2018-11-13 17:26:57 I hope that doesn't mean what I think it means.......
4967 2018-11-13 17:26:43 holding the guns, but we all buy oil, whether that's to heat our houses, drive cars, or drink from reusable water bottles. your problem is with the military-industrial complex, not with soldiers.

3. "soldiers are presented as heroes and get help when they get back, but (9/)
4968 2018-11-13 17:26:42 the money was already allocated as payment in lieu of oil imports, only the actual transfer to Iran was delayed due to the international scenario
4969 2018-11-13 17:26:33 Be interesting to find out if it works. Be more interesting to find out what they make it with. Cbd is produced in different ways some actual cbd and some not so much. Hemp oil I think. Actual cbd helps the scalp and can help the hair grow. Contains multiple vitamins.

4981 2018-11-13 17:25:50 Why is there a need for palm oil in that particular product. Is it necessary?
4982 2018-11-13 17:25:49 Canada should be using it's own oil. Who's funding the pipeline blockage?
4983 2018-11-13 17:25:38 From 2day I will no longer buy products with #PalmOil Mine will be a Palm Oil free house  this Xmas!! Better 4 my health anyway!! Pls read the ingredients before buying products & keep the ones with Palm Oil on the shelf!! #PalmOilFreeChristmas #PalmOilAlarmCall #PalmOilFree
4984 2018-11-13 17:25:31 I just wish it didn't take so much oil  My wife is all about buying quality (read: more expensive) oils and it sucks how fast you can go through them. Although thankfully Costco has some decent prices...

4997 2018-11-13 17:25:03 black seed oil saves lives
4998 2018-11-13 17:25:03 Just to clarify, I said oil would fall below $26 to at least $20 & could fall to $10. Probably get there in 2nd half 2019. The coming bust will hit global oil demand very hard & prices will fall very sharply. I'm guessing you own some oil stocks.
4999 2018-11-13 17:25:02 I remember my old man He worked in the oil fields And now I understand why
5000 2018-11-13 17:24:57 Bet there were plenty of good orangatan parents that have been killed due to your greed of palm oil. Please stop using it. This is what the consumer wants. I for one will never buy your products again until you stop

5003 2018-11-13 17:24:53 I am not a fan of @Anna_Soubry  etc but her argument was - commercials with political content should not be allowed. She was otherwise supportive of Iceland policy on not stocking palm oil
5004 2018-11-13 17:24:47 Oil down 4% today, and £ up over 1%, should equal big price reductions at the pumps please @Tesco @sainsburys @Morrisons
5005 2018-11-13 17:24:36 Nice, I normally smoke straight oil but I just ran out
5006 2018-11-13 17:24:30 Your second point is rather philosophical: whatever we do with any resource, we do because humans wanted to. If you were to persuade everyone to stop harvesting palm oil and leave it be, then it would still be humans dictating what happens to palm oil, based on our preferences.
5007 2018-11-13 17:24:25 Ko ukazotenga cooking oil ne mazoe
5008 2018-11-13 17:24:23 You moved the discussion to oil companies big guy. Not me. Do some research on Carbon Credits and see where the money goes
5009 2018-11-13 17:24:19 He really blew it on this one. Forgot who voted for him. It wasn't Wall St or Silicon Valley. He has hurt oil producers, miners, farmers and many others with his trade war and only made the deficit worse. Took this too far and created a mess in the markets he once praised.

5011 2018-11-13 17:24:10 In 1970s, Jimmy Carter’s talked about the Workd running out of oil by 2011. It’s 2018 and we are pumping record amounts. My point is that politicians don’t have a good track record with predictions

5016 2018-11-13 17:23:54 "Plans" is different from actually doing it. The democrats "Planned" great stuff since the election of Obama yet delivered little. The public stunts is from the corporate democrat Pelosi who get's paid by Oil Money to "Plan" for eternity!
5017 2018-11-13 17:23:49 I didnt know that. I have to admit to being fairly ignorant on palm oil and it’s wide usage until very recently. So I’m trying to educate myself and thought RSPO products was a start, to possibly make some difference.
5018 2018-11-13 17:23:46 were there many oil spills darren? seem to remember a few ....

5037 2018-11-13 17:21:55 Lots of complicated logistics to make this work. It would take a great deal of time to build a market for it. Coastal refineries are designed to receive oil on cargo ships. A pipe to coast makes the most sense, but desperate times lead to desperate measures.

5061 2018-11-13 17:19:50 Price reduction is due to fall in crude oil prices. 22% fall in crude price in last one month. But, only 6% reduced in diesel and petrol price in the same period. This is fact...
5062 2018-11-13 17:19:44 If a resource is scarce, why use it? Nabisco is a highly profitable business, but their inefficient palm oil sourcing is ruining the ecosystem. We have to eliminate the idea that just because a resource is on this earth that it's ours for the taking

5081 2018-11-13 17:18:06 @dean_anonym Hi Dean. We believe the palm oil industry can still flourish without destroying rainforests, harming communities or endangered wildlife. This is why we’re focused on ensuring 100% sustainable supply.

5083 2018-11-13 17:17:54 When was the last time you checked your oil levels? Do this weekly, more so if you travel long distances. Never let your car run dry.
5084 2018-11-13 17:17:52 Erm, cod liver oil tablets ???
5085 2018-11-13 17:17:48 are there any ETF of oil tracking equities that you follow stewie?
5086 2018-11-13 17:17:48 I should start getting into oil, I would spend way less money
5087 2018-11-13 17:17:47 What would be better is if this energy and $ was put to fighting the US FUNDED anti-pipeline activists landlocking our oil.  But for the most part Calgarians sit on their hands on this more important issue.  Actually both the Olympics and pipelines would be great.

5089 2018-11-13 17:17:34 And why aren't prices lower, you Orange Faced Gibbon?

You should speak to your former SecState Tillerson about the conflux of oil supply and demand together with oil company practices of price fixing gasoline by zip code.
5090 2018-11-13 17:17:28 My therapist has one... I begged her to set it up so we can turn it on... It now sits next to me during my sessions... Though I'm still a mess I always say "Imagine if the salt light wasn't turned on." LOL ((CBD oil is all kinds of awesome too!))  Big hugs, Z.
5091 2018-11-13 17:17:22 Thanks for reading. I address, in detailed and quantified terms, how to fund the expected rise in electricity demand from transport electrification in my Oil Fall series. Hope you will consider reading. Thanks.

5097 2018-11-13 17:16:52 I swear y'all be too sheltered for your own good. Everyone here gonna be overwhelmed by how much your parents spent for you, starved for you and burned the extra midnight oil just to see you finally get up on your own two feet. This ain't rocket science, go make their day. Byeeee
5098 2018-11-13 17:16:44 Ahh okay that's good, tea tree still has a tolerable smell  Yea it's great! It really helps calm down any acne, even the hormonal acne during my period  I should try yours too but tea tree oil is always tricky with my skin, sometimes it works, other times definitely not
5099 2018-11-13 17:16:42 I trust the modern day oil filled heaters are safer than the old style! Even so, be careful with that thing.
5100 2018-11-13 17:16:36 Canada’s oil is way cheaper. Half the price. What the hell are you doing in Saudi besides taking “Golden Showers” or sommat?!??
5101 2018-11-13 17:16:15 Yes oil companies are the worlds largest cartels
5102 2018-11-13 17:16:15 Did u get a welcome card? I got free olive oil!!
5103 2018-11-13 17:16:14 I need to do laundry and get an oil change, today. It’s a MUST!

5105 2018-11-13 17:16:09 @CadburyUK when are you giving up the palm oil?  No Cadbury’s for our family this Christmas.  Love the orangutans!
5106 2018-11-13 17:16:06 but he doesn't have Trump's charisma and gift of selling snake oil
5107 2018-11-13 17:16:05 Hi, thank you for the reply I will read your policy on palm oil, it's better to have the facts an information
5108 2018-11-13 17:15:54 Colorado weed ain’t shit lol their oil is fire tho lol
5109 2018-11-13 17:15:48 In local shop virtually everything classified as confectionary has palm oil. Insidious product that globalization has foisted on us
5110 2018-11-13 17:15:44 I normally like @piersmorgan but his point about soy farming causing more damage than palm oil and this whole let’s all hate vegans cause they eat soy is stupid as most soy is farmed for FEED FOR LIVESTOCK SO RLY IF WE STOP EATING MEAT WE’RE HELPING WITH THIS you tit
5111 2018-11-13 17:15:41 Got my oil changed yesterday and now oil is leaking. Now I’m back at the shop smfh

5117 2018-11-13 17:15:26 Then what's your counter plan for the environment? Because we can't keep sticking our heads in the oil sands!
5118 2018-11-13 17:15:25 Folks, that iceland ad is great, and palm oil products are really bad. But if you think about it for a moment you’ll probably realise that you *really* don’t want a situation where corporations can run politically motivated advertising campaigns.
5119 2018-11-13 17:15:23 Wow an Indian profile commenting on our PM Amazed to see a Rapist nation using all their sources to spread propaganda against Pakistan on twitter. Modi is the real beggar who begs in Saudi Arabia and UAE for OIL.
5120 2018-11-13 17:15:12 My oil out for delivery 
5121 2018-11-13 17:15:06 Tbf, palm oil is one of the unhealthiest oils. There's good reason to boycott it from multiple fronts.

5123 2018-11-13 17:14:53 Macron is trying to take Europe one step closer to One World Order. President Trump is not having it. Long hard fight for our President against the phony lying and liars. Snake oil salesmen are slick.
5124 2018-11-13 17:14:43 So, the cat walked across my palette of OIL PAINTS. Anyone who knows paints, knows this is a disaster. #ampainting #amcleaning
5125 2018-11-13 17:14:36 @POTUS
Oil at this price will allow OPEC to  bankrupt US producers, supporting businesses, and families. 
In your ignorance you think this is a good thing. Might I suggest that you go build a hotel or something and stay the hell out of the oil industry. 
You gave no clue.
5126 2018-11-13 17:14:33 is it crazy to think that Big Oil *should* have a seat at the table? they do have a lot of $$ that could be reinvested in green initiatives. some are already trying to diversify energy. i’m just thinking about the employees... part of sustainability is avoiding economic crashes.
5127 2018-11-13 17:14:26 Yeah, I will buy more if we push below the recent lows. Wanting some more oil and gas, but that's a rodeo right now.
5128 2018-11-13 17:14:14 Coconut oil is the best but smells and stains

5130 2018-11-13 17:13:45 It's all part of the con, Like the coming Saudi cut which isn't actually a cut but rather a return to prudent levels of production. YES, House of Lies to keep oil down until they cause it to blow the roof off like they have on nat gas.

5134 2018-11-13 17:13:17 It was a snake oil conference commitment that Corbyn agreed to..he fucking knew it. He's shafting everyone!
5135 2018-11-13 17:13:11 The tech industry is relatively moral...compared to big oil and big pharmaceutical but that’s like saying Stalin had nothing on the devil.

5139 2018-11-13 17:12:56 They need to stop all palm oil in their stores not just their brand
5140 2018-11-13 17:12:53 I don’t know, you tell me.  Many people are saying @realDonaldTrump is dweeb, a snake oil salesman, a maroon, a kremlin puppet, an orange monkey, a fraudulent image of a human made of crumpled paper and masking tape painted orange and wearing a diaper? I’ve heard these things.
5141 2018-11-13 17:12:42 High in vitamin E and fatty acids, CBD Oil nourishes the scalp and strengthens hair, thereby encouraging hair growth. Inside CBD Oil are omega-3, omega-6 and the omega-9 acids, which according to CBD Century help improve the quality of the scalp tissue. From Google 
5142 2018-11-13 17:12:41 A big oil crack will seal the call for a recession. Almost everything is signalling one anyways

5144 2018-11-13 17:11:58 The only chocolate bar I can find without palm oil is  'Bounty'! 
Real chocolate only has cocoa butter & milk fat Palm oil is just cheap filler at the expense of precious rainforests & its wildlife. Shame on you @CadburyUK you are buying from slash & burn producers of palm oil
5145 2018-11-13 17:11:50 It still makes the best cookies...what do you use? Olive oil?

5150 2018-11-13 17:11:21 cause 20 yrs oil revenue isnt 12 times larger than the deficit as he claimed ?
5151 2018-11-13 17:11:13 I think that was maybe meant for someone else and My poor oil Ma got in the way 
5152 2018-11-13 17:11:03 I can understand that Orang Utans prefer rain forest to palm oil trees, how about the effect on the atmosphere? Do palm oil tree plantations not absorb CO2 and give out oxygen?
5153 2018-11-13 17:11:02 When I worked in clinic I told this to every single able-bodied patient:

5154 2018-11-13 17:10:56 Greek Olive oil coming to north america is mixed with italian lower quality one. You never get your father's quality at the store. So, assume 1 year supplies.
5155 2018-11-13 17:10:51 Look, if you are not soaking your pizza in olive oil and shouting to you BFF have you even gone to Regina!!

I'm using one with 100% peanuts + some salt from Edeka, it's still oily enough & very yummy :)
5158 2018-11-13 17:10:39 Wrong. It’s your performance. Paris alienation,  North Korea advances, CA wild fires response, China trade war toll, deficit, oil uncertainties after Iran, fake invasion ... Do something positive!

5163 2018-11-13 17:10:09 I was meeting my dad’s colleague the other day and I put my hand out for a handshake but his hands, unbeknownst to me, were covered in oil so he held out the back of his hand and I thought he was trying to be cool so i fist bumped him and I still haven’t lived it down.
5164 2018-11-13 17:10:05 The effective price for subsidized cylinder increased from 414 to 505 in 4 years of Modi, that too after considerable reduction in global crude oil price. Still fools continue worshipping him.

5166 2018-11-13 17:10:04 I've seen the video. But they really didn't laugh at all! I don't get this hate that spreading like a virus. And we shouldn't adding oil to the fire. It's just keep making the whole situation worse
5167 2018-11-13 17:10:03 Use it for a crush washer next time you do an oil change.
5168 2018-11-13 17:10:00 @Alexios1201  Are they definately drilling the vanji too?
5169 2018-11-13 17:09:59 don't even start me on the 'massage' bit (ending up feeling stroked lightly all over by a disinterested stranger and left covered in oil). Do not see the appeal.
5170 2018-11-13 17:09:54 Certainly I think a real possibility! POTUS many times when campaigning said phrases like.."Follow the Money", "take the OIL" (asset for money) etc.
5171 2018-11-13 17:09:40 oil tycoons pockets got fatter and the ice caps got smaller, in this case correlation does equal causation

5175 2018-11-13 17:09:21 This I agree with you.  Higher oil prices will kill our economy.
5176 2018-11-13 17:09:15 Finding oil is important but having sense is importanter

5179 2018-11-13 17:08:58 Oil down more than 4%, good news for the economy #Oil #economy
5180 2018-11-13 17:08:57 Lower oil is good for the economy; one less "tax" to worry about.
5181 2018-11-13 17:08:54 But they CAN be sure to source deforestation-free NOW from POIG. And they don't. POIG palm oil has been independently verified to be deforestation-free.
5182 2018-11-13 17:08:47 What's a good moisturizer for you skin? Not just oil that sits on your skin, something that really keeps it moist.

and VOTE in every election.. vote, vote, vote
5184 2018-11-13 17:08:38 Bigger picture?  As in moving oil and gas jobs/profit to places like the US, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia?
5185 2018-11-13 17:08:32 yes I'm sure they said the same thing about Standard Oil, US Steel, and the American Tobacco Company
5186 2018-11-13 17:08:26 For eng? Baby oil?

Who has shares in Palm oil?
5190 2018-11-13 17:08:04 @Oreo shame on you !! Drop Wilmar. Drop dirty palm oil. I won't be buying for family from now on !!!
5191 2018-11-13 17:07:56 I've been eating a spoonful of coconut oil every day for the past 4 days, and i've already lost 5 pounds more So not only am I using coconut oil on my skin, and I'm soft as fuck I can eat it, and it's a laxative, and it makes you lose weight.
5192 2018-11-13 17:07:50 From what I have read years age these people are from the deserts and the Gov't from those countries support the people from oil sales.  Must be nice.  We don't have that luxury in the US.

5201 2018-11-13 17:07:10 @grazedotcom Hi whilst chowing down on one of your berry & vanilla morning oat minis I realised they contain palm oil. I normally check but assumed that you wouldn't want to help to kill innocent animals! Maybe a recipe change is in order?
5202 2018-11-13 17:07:07 Eru and Ndole ? 

One person decided to mix groundnuts, onions and a plant. 
Another one decided to mix two plants together. Two plants!!! 
And put palm oil with seasoning. Then you compare both. Which other meal in Cameroon mixes two plants? 

Eru > Ndole is my point.
5203 2018-11-13 17:07:05 @LinusTech have you considered reviewing the Nuraphone headphones? I feel like we really could use someone who could enlighten the public about what is legit/interesting and what might be "snake oil" about those headphones.
5204 2018-11-13 17:07:01 I am frightened it will come back to reclaim me.

It is a constant drip of torture
And I am terrified.

5205 2018-11-13 17:07:00 Control of W.Europe served only to allow Germany to focus on capturing resources to the east (oil, etc.). I love the USA, but US/Can./Brit/Fr.Resist. opening of the W. front only hastened German demise. Group effort with largest number from USSR.
5206 2018-11-13 17:06:59 The Oil Services ETF $OIH is at a 15-year low.
5207 2018-11-13 17:06:41 But that's what @IcelandFoods is doing - removing palm oil from its own brand products until it is sure it can source rainforest-destruction free palm oil. It's what the ad promotes. Let's face it, even @RSPOtweets is struggling to assure such at the moment in some cases.
5208 2018-11-13 17:06:39 but oil appears to be trying to go up ,trying is a key word lol , but NATURAL GAS HAS BEEN LOOKING AWSOME !

5212 2018-11-13 17:06:09 If they want deforestation-free, why don't they buy it? Unless the deforestation-free palm oil is bought, what motivation does any grower have to become deforestation-free?
5213 2018-11-13 17:05:51 What’s the issue with Palm oil?
5214 2018-11-13 17:05:51 Every oil company knew.
5215 2018-11-13 17:05:39 Doing bugger all about palm oil though. End of 2019 for ‘sustainable sources’ isn’t good enough for the animals that will be killed between now and then...
5216 2018-11-13 17:05:38 Except Venezuela are rich in oil!
5217 2018-11-13 17:05:37 The only conspiracy is aimed against Canadian oil & gas industry. Vivian Krause followed the money.
5218 2018-11-13 17:05:34 Most of the other parties to the Nuke deal are trying to save it. At this point if Iran hangs on for two years there is a chance that a new US president jumps back into the deal. Also, as has become very clear to the oil markets today, US sanctions aren't stopping Iranian oil.

5222 2018-11-13 17:05:22 Help put an end to #palmoil rainforest destruction > RT to tell @RSPOtweets to vote to strengthen palm oil industry standards #RSPO #RT16
5223 2018-11-13 17:05:17 Cut the backbone out and do it in a skillet and the oven.  Go ahead and season it now.  I fill the skillet with root veggies and let them soak up the chicken fat.  You can add butter or flavored oil under the skin and directly on the meat
5224 2018-11-13 17:05:05 Did you know Peppermint Essential Oil can assist in pest control? Spray around doors, windowsills and outside perimeter to help reduce unwanted visitors this winter! #WyndmereNaturals #MNLocal #WyndmereFunFact #TuesdayTips #Aromatherapy #winter #pests #Peppermint #EssentialOils
5225 2018-11-13 17:05:03 We get it, you’re 100 in esports years, go oil your joints.
5226 2018-11-13 17:04:56 "Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood from the altar and sprinkled them on Aaron and his garments and on his sons and their garments. So he consecrated Aaron and his garments and his sons and their garments."
Leviticus 8:30
5227 2018-11-13 17:04:56 Except your Christmas puds (and other items customers will likely buy mainly for Xmas) still contain the stuff! Bit of an unfortunate omission, especially as you've had several months to find replacements and palm oil free Xmas puddings do exist #PalmOilFreeChristmas
5228 2018-11-13 17:04:51 We don't eat cadbury's and buy mostly palm oil free products. Far healthier for you.
5229 2018-11-13 17:04:44 Why are they logging?  Can't they just pick the fruit?  This is another example of how humans are destroying the Earth.  We need labels telling us what products use palm oil so we have an informed choice whether to buy them or not.  This has to stop!
5230 2018-11-13 17:04:42 How about an empty OKI cooking oil of 18 ltrs?
5231 2018-11-13 17:04:30 I'm having a breakdown over an omelette yes, stupid oil and grease. I feel like the whole day is ruined so I even bought a protein bar. I'm gonna be above my calories I just hope that if it's only one day won't make me gain but I'll weight myself tomorrow
5232 2018-11-13 17:04:26 Clinique is sooo expensive! I bought some Tarte maracuja oil which seems to help with the dryness but makes my t-zone so oily. I can’t win 
5233 2018-11-13 17:04:20 boyle oil
5234 2018-11-13 17:04:13 UN and what are you going to do about the worldwide flaring of gas in the oil industry and polluting shipping ??? Please reply seriously and honestly .....
5235 2018-11-13 17:04:11 This draw is fully expected by those following real RUKSA+ production capacity, versus claims. There is way less oil out there than thought, with much of recent claimed production increases by RUKSA actually being inventory decreases. Mkt is trading sentiment, not fundamentals.
5236 2018-11-13 17:04:08 The ad very clearly states in text at the end that @IcelandFoods is removing palm oil until it is deforestation-free - that's precisely what @RSPOtweets is striving for! That's what I want. That's a boycott of rainforest loss. @RAN @RainforestTrust @RFUK
5237 2018-11-13 17:04:03 It's 10c here. I've bought a small oil filled radiator you plug in. Hopefully it'll be more controllable than the storage heaters!
5238 2018-11-13 17:03:58 For those of you who can't use cannabis due to drug testing for work... try some essential oils. Doterra, young living and rocky mountain oils.
All very pure and natural. 
There is an oil for everything!
And quit using deoderant with aluminium and toothpaste with fluoride!!

5244 2018-11-13 17:03:35 Use ghee.. or coconut oil..

5247 2018-11-13 17:03:26 The dead bits are going to have to be cut off  but u can do it gradually! Coconut oil and Cantu are the best for my hair anyways!
5248 2018-11-13 17:03:16 Shit you will never use after school. They should teach us all how to cook, change oil and tire, balance a checkbook and do a budget. Those are useful things in life!
5249 2018-11-13 17:03:09 How did I have an appointment and this oil change is still 2 hours?
5250 2018-11-13 17:03:05 Are you broken? Or stuck? Some oil maybe?
5251 2018-11-13 17:03:02 Steve Bannon, a self-serious pseudo-intellectual oil spill
5252 2018-11-13 17:02:58 Oil is so prehistoric.  Get with it tRump
5253 2018-11-13 17:02:58 We have an actual WHITE NATIONALIST in the White House. THAT is our biggest problem right now. The rest (like climate change, for ex..which Trump denies even exists) will sort itself out once we get this incompetent snake oil salesman out
5254 2018-11-13 17:02:56 U think that today's intake (150 cal slice of bread, a 155 cal protein bar, eggs and salad for lunch that unfortunately were very greasy and had oil and maybe a soup for dinner) will make me gain a lot? I wouldn't call it a binge but I feel like I've ruined the whole day.
5255 2018-11-13 17:02:50 Neil Young is also against Canadian oil.
5256 2018-11-13 17:02:43 Urgent call from my father in Greece: "George, we just finished the olive harvest.  Do you want me to send 15 gallons of oil or is 10 enough?"

Is this really a question?
5257 2018-11-13 17:02:38 Tsa removed my body lotion and my hair oil. So y’all want me to be ashy ashy 
5258 2018-11-13 17:02:34 One day I hit the brakes hard on my old car. What do you know? A vial of oil rolled out from under the seat. It 'd been there 20 years. Kind of ironic that it survived all those years under the seat cushion but could not survive 20 mins with me. Nothing better than pot treasure!
5259 2018-11-13 17:02:33 We don't have an on-air show today --but our on-line @CNBCFuturesNow will be one to watch --Its a fully packed show covering equities, gold and oil --PNC’s Jeff Mills and John Laforge join us at 1pm
5260 2018-11-13 17:02:19 If you go that route (and are new to hard anodized without nonstick), just know that you’re going to absolutely RUIN eggs for a bit until you learn the right amount of oil and preheating. But with enough practice, you’ll be able to make ‘em without the spatula.
5261 2018-11-13 17:02:18 Pay them to leave the forest alone. Just because their natural resources are above the ground doesn't mean they should be free when we pay so much for oil and other resources below the ground.
5262 2018-11-13 17:02:16 Oil companies actually manufacture products, Gasoline and Diesel and Vasoline among others, which consumers need and pay for. Global Warming profiteers sell Carbon Credits for millions. Do you know what a carbon credit is? R how it helps the climate?
5263 2018-11-13 17:02:07 @pepsi stop using deforestation as a means of getting your palm oil. Consumers are watching. #deforestation #Sustainable #Boycott
5264 2018-11-13 17:02:05 The ad quite clearly states "Until all palm oil causes zero rainforest destruction, we're removing palm oil from all our own label products'. @RSPOtweets is striving for zero deforestation palm oil too. So who's calling for a moratorium? @RainforestTrust @rangtanforest @RAN

5267 2018-11-13 17:02:02 Wow, count this as example #1000+ of how the opposite of what everyone was worried about happening actually ends up happening.  (another fav example: peak oil)
5268 2018-11-13 17:01:53 They must not teach irony in prep schools for great-grandsons of oil tycoons.
5269 2018-11-13 17:01:53 I let my hair soak in oil last night and plan on washing it tonight but it’s literally so annoying everyone keeps asking me why my hair wet. Bitch leave me alone I’m nourishing it!!!!
5270 2018-11-13 17:01:53 One of the pitfalls of buying a used car is that you cannot be sure if the maintenance records are accurate. Therefore, it would be best to start fresh by performing preventive maintenance like changing the oil and replacing plugs.
5271 2018-11-13 17:01:49 Castor Oil on eyelashes work wonders.  @AsimSupreme has some.
5272 2018-11-13 17:01:48 Lagi coba pake bio oil sih aku baru bbrp hari blm terlalu keliatan juga hasilnya hehe
5273 2018-11-13 17:01:37 Umuahiah people and their surprises. How will someone ask you for Palm Oil and you bring out Pall Mall (cigarette).
5274 2018-11-13 17:01:25 Yeah, @Oreo , if you managed to make Oreos vegan, surely you can find another oil source

5278 2018-11-13 17:00:57 Rashi- although same amount of oil used in menaorah even for winter nights, the mechanism by which the length of lighting was changed was by wick width.
5279 2018-11-13 17:00:56 I know exactly who and what they are. Believe me. It's hard sometimes to sift through the BS with dems but there are always voting records. Votes for war and insane military budgets, oil and gas or corporate rights etc. It never ends.
5280 2018-11-13 17:00:54 I’m done taking my ACV/Black Seed Oil mixture before bed. I be having real life vivid nightmares
5281 2018-11-13 17:00:47 Argan oil sounds much less like a moisturizer ingredient and much more like the thing the Power Rangers have to collect to revive Zordon
5282 2018-11-13 17:00:44 USA production of oil should cover USA needs.
5283 2018-11-13 17:00:44 Message from my daughter - Kit Kats, Doritos, m&m’s, Cadbury’s, Pop Tarts, Colgate, Johnson’s and Head & Shoulders all use palm oil so we need to stop eating/using all that 
5284 2018-11-13 17:00:40 Owww! I was putting more oil in my car and when I went to grab the funnel I hit my head on the side of my trunk. I may have got a cut, but I'm sure I'll be fine.
5285 2018-11-13 17:00:35 Hey @CadburyWorld can’t you find a replacement for palm oil instead of forcing the extinction of Orangutans through deforestation of their natural habitat?

5289 2018-11-13 17:00:23 They are not distinguishing between certified and uncertified palm oil. We agree retailers should not source uncertified palm oil, of course!
5290 2018-11-13 17:00:22 Or using palm oil in your products.
5291 2018-11-13 17:00:21 Best meal plan -if anyone doesn't know where to start: Big bowl of Green Salads with 1 piece of grass fed meat and some coconut oil or ghee.

5293 2018-11-13 17:00:15 I told Gary earlier if we blow at the screen the #aaog price will go up.
And Voila !
5294 2018-11-13 17:00:13 Half log of oil brought with bread for Todah, but not divided evenly. Half used for Challot (loaves) and Rekikin (wafers), and the other half used for Revachot (scalded flour).
5295 2018-11-13 17:00:11 I'm even more mad cause I ate eggs and salad that are 2 of my safe foods and the fact that it had so much oil and grease ruined it all for me
5296 2018-11-13 17:00:04 MN89: Oil required for Nazir’s bread and for bread for Todah; Oil required for Menorah and for Menachot; Mixing libations; Lamb brought with the Omer.

5299 2018-11-13 16:59:55 R Yirmiyah- if lamp of menorah went out, its wick should be cleaned and a full measure of oil should be replaced in lamp.
5300 2018-11-13 16:59:52 Quebec and the Maritimes will go hard Liberal next year. They depend on all those handouts the Feds give them from western oil money.
The west will go mostly Conservative with the Liberals wiped out.
The question is Ontario. They will decide the next government.
5301 2018-11-13 16:59:49 Crude oil prices are going down, gas prices as well cupcake...
5302 2018-11-13 16:59:48 rosehip oil
5303 2018-11-13 16:59:47 Each lamp of the menorah held half a log of oil.
5304 2018-11-13 16:59:45 There is always a story. No matter what happens in markets, a story is presented to justify the move. KSA, Iran, shale, Trump...take your pick. This move down in oil is purely technical.
5305 2018-11-13 16:59:38 R Meir- even though the hin measure was only used once by Moshe for the anointing oil, it’s measuring cup was in the temple.

5307 2018-11-13 16:59:34 Natural gas expected to overtake coal as the world’s 2nd largest energy source after oil by 2030,due to a drive to cut air pollution & the rise of LNG.
5308 2018-11-13 16:59:30 Massive investment in carbon capture technologies, massive forest replanting (think billions of trees), plus mass conversion to solar+battery dependence, and voiding ALL leases on oil reserves. 

564 Gt; post apocalyptic existence.

5314 2018-11-13 16:58:53 use vaseline or any oil
5315 2018-11-13 16:58:51 Stop with the automated answers to every tweet. And stop with the Palm Oil now. Youre killing animals on a daily basis and @PETAUK @peta want to back you. Awful from both parties.

5319 2018-11-13 16:58:29 How about you and the other "elected officials" go first and stop using gas, electricity and oil.  Let us know how that works out.

5326 2018-11-13 16:57:58 You can make your own or just buy a cheap one, they're all essentially the same main ingredients like jojoba oil and argan oil, and like something else for smell
5327 2018-11-13 16:57:57 Hi again, Victoria, this is a really important issue and we’ve been at the forefront of driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years. We’re on track to meeting our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
5328 2018-11-13 16:57:55 Hot oil massages. Not that they get to know which oil does what up front but each have a % chance of raising either their STR, DEX, or CON by 1 permanently

5336 2018-11-13 16:57:01 But Singapore has more men than women in their government. Make sure you tell them that they are evil unless it is exactly 50/50. Also, I heard they use oil. Make sure to lecture them on saving the world.
5337 2018-11-13 16:56:57 So how do I find out exactly what does and does not contain palm oil?

5342 2018-11-13 16:56:38 The level OIH is trading at supports your view that there is no end in sight for low capex levels in oil & gas
5343 2018-11-13 16:56:30 when your in a shop supermarket point out to people if they pick up brands with palm oil in it and see the reaction. its clear people are not happy with using an unnecessary luxury ingredient thats raping our planet. Cadbury could be leading the way but its unsociable.
5344 2018-11-13 16:56:30 The first know study on climate change by the fossil fuel industry was in 1957 by Humble Oil, now ExxonMobil.

5352 2018-11-13 16:55:54 the world is fine and thus oil will eventually be fine. This OPEC cut is very odd but then again OPEC is very odd
5353 2018-11-13 16:55:48 Peppermint essential oil , smell it for a couple of minute or rub on temples and forehead also give yourself a scalp massage not too hard but also not to light  hope this helps
5354 2018-11-13 16:55:41 @HSBC Palm oil investors. Corruption is rife and business protects itself, not the planet. Welcome to #civilisation.
5355 2018-11-13 16:55:35 So quit raising prices and blaming OPEC if we have this much of the oil market.

5357 2018-11-13 16:55:27 Crude oil prices are so volatile!

Few weeks ago, oil prices hit $86 but now, it's under $70
5358 2018-11-13 16:55:25 Rude Crude Oil. ! ?
5359 2018-11-13 16:55:20 Not surprised - this is globally pretty standard - most places have requirements for ‘local’ priority for some jobs and philanthropy applied to oil companies operating in their home areas. Provinces in Canada do it , the country as a whole compels priority as well for Canadians

5363 2018-11-13 16:54:26 yeah we give cod liver oil as well.  His ears are standing just not as well as i want.  hopefully a few more posts will do the trick.  He also only has his adult front teeth...nothing else has fallen out yet
5364 2018-11-13 16:54:22 You can desulphurize MGO it is mainly Distillates and Vacuum Gas oil which can be desulphurized. 

MDO is more or less the 0.5% USLFO. Difficult to desulphurize FO so they blend it down with low sulphur distillates. The blend ratio dependent on sulphur contnent of the FO.
5365 2018-11-13 16:54:21 of course they won't lower production meant higher oil prices
5366 2018-11-13 16:54:21 tell him how his oil and sdr prediction is working out so far.
5367 2018-11-13 16:54:20 certified. Our aim is to ensure zero deforestation from the use of palm oil in the manufacture of M&S products by 2020. Thank you, Katie. 2/2
5368 2018-11-13 16:54:19 @AmbJohnBolton Does your support of the crown prince & KSA have anything to do with the KSA/Black Water scheme to take out Iranian leaders by assassination? KSA regime is brutal,supports terrorism. US in now oil dependent. We don't need them (except for petro $).
5369 2018-11-13 16:54:16 Hi Caroline, as you have mentioned, we've already removed palm oil wherever possible and we’re pleased to say that 100% of the palm oil used in M&S products is RSPO 1/2
5370 2018-11-13 16:54:13 Yes they've said they'll remove all palm oil from their own brand products and encourage other retailers to do the same. This is contrary to the recommendations of groups like Greenpeace, Orangutan Land Trust and Rainforest Action Network NOT to boycott but to source sustainably.
5371 2018-11-13 16:54:02 Its hard to believe this is happening.  All this over some mineral oil crap that the fda approved for trail?  This drug is gonna help millions!
5372 2018-11-13 16:53:49 My body and this cold air is like water and oil we not mixing 
5373 2018-11-13 16:53:46 Tweet, call your friends in the media, call your HFT buddies at the PPT. Presto it's like magic, oil goes down for 12 days in row and we now have a massive oil glut. MAGA

@CNBC_Awaaz #AwaazMarkets
5375 2018-11-13 16:53:28 Certified palm oil only represents about 20% of supply, so, yes, it's available but limited, and 80% of the stuff isn't certified. I wish all manufacturers would boycott uncertified palm oil, as that'll bolster @RSPOtweets 's position
5376 2018-11-13 16:53:27 The Honda dealerships have to use a different higher grade oil here (that’s what the guy said ) and I don’t go anywhere else that Honda to do my car stuff bc I’m paranoid. I used to only pay $49 at the Honda in Houston I’m SAD

5379 2018-11-13 16:52:46 (maybe adding some finishing oil at the end...with some turpines maybe?)
5380 2018-11-13 16:52:33 Wish the oil wasn’t promoted...other than that, it’s perfect

5387 2018-11-13 16:52:12 Cannabis oil used to treat epilepsy is a big issue in the UK at the moment too and the demand for re-classification is loud - with what sounds like legitimate justification. Needs a cultural re-classification too, obviously!

5390 2018-11-13 16:51:47 Amsterdam is a great place for real CBD (very strong) knocked out a friend who took more than needed (greedy) expecting the diluted store version. He was also shown THC oil, but with a CBD label. The owner HAD a brain tumour, that's how we found out.
5391 2018-11-13 16:51:29 We need defending from Russia .. oh but we want to buy their oil too 
5392 2018-11-13 16:51:26 There was a belief that our market dependency on the US would sustain us forever. That was good until the oil industry itself fuelled the US shale revolution.
5393 2018-11-13 16:51:22 Not sure what your point is but wind turbines are killing far more birds worldwide than oil has.
5394 2018-11-13 16:51:22 The guys that won the Nobel did so for finding the causal relationship between Carbon Tax and environmental impact but Andrew Sheer is paid by oil so I don’t know who to believe

5397 2018-11-13 16:51:10 That and cowardice.

5403 2018-11-13 16:50:51 And why not ask others to do the same, i.e. to avoid using palm oil that's not @RSPOtweets certified? I don't support a boycott, but I do support firms who refuse to use non-certified palm oil.
5404 2018-11-13 16:50:47 A glass and a half of palm oil in every bar

5407 2018-11-13 16:50:26 Let’s make it a challenge. I’ll go cold turkey on oil, you go cold turkey on water.
5408 2018-11-13 16:50:25 WTI #CrudeOil (now at $56.85) has a major support around $56.35 & can bounce up from dips to these levels.
Only a Break-down below $56, will lead #Oil to plunge downwards to $45 levels.
5409 2018-11-13 16:50:23 Part of that plan was the Paris Climate Accord, and had you helped turn out the vote for @HillaryClinton we would still be in it, and wouldn't have oil and coal industry shills running our regulatory agencies. This is such astroturf nonsense.
5410 2018-11-13 16:50:21 WTI #CrudeOil (now at $56.85) has a major support around $56.35 & can bounce up from dips to these levels.
Only a Break-down below $56, will lead #Oil to plunge downwards to $45 levels.
5411 2018-11-13 16:50:16 It's a very important message but if  they truly care they would stop selling ALL products that contain palm oil, not just their own labels. What's their plan for that? What % of  products containing palm oil will they actually stop selling?
5412 2018-11-13 16:50:04 I suggest you deep condition once a week for 90 minutes with Moroccan Arogan oil.. No coconut unless your hair is dry or curly
5413 2018-11-13 16:49:59 I’ve been taking fish oil pills for over a month, and I’ve never had an issue with fishy burps, but today, I’m burping all fish, all the time. Ew.

5415 2018-11-13 16:49:50 $UWT breaks $21.04 gonna get a short squeeze in oil
5416 2018-11-13 16:49:49 Why do you say 'claiming'? Is @IcelandFoods not telling the truth? If they're removing palm oil because they can't find enough that's @RSPOtweets certified, rather than make up the difference with uncertified, that seems perfectly sensible.
5417 2018-11-13 16:49:46 Is it calling for a boycott? Like all retailers, it still sells products containing palm oil. It's giving consumers a choice. Consumers who have become active campaigners as a result of the widespread publicity. I hope there's a way for you all to get together & sort it out soon

5430 2018-11-13 16:48:50 I remember when 10 oil freighters sat in International waters while gas prices skyrocketed in the US, as Saudi's waited for the prices to rise to suit their bank accounts. That is not trade, that is holding people hostage.
5431 2018-11-13 16:48:40 Brilliant, how close to release in it? Also, whilst the conversation is turned to palm oil, this is the information that needs to be forefront, it’s all good saying a boycott won’t work but people need alternative ways to help! #helppeoplehelp
5432 2018-11-13 16:48:36 You realise it is only renewable on a large timescale, over-consumption of oil worldwide would lead to dwindling supplies or technical innovation. It is clear you only know one side of the debate.

5437 2018-11-13 16:48:21 Unknowingly is a generous stretch. Fossil fuel use and its affect on the climate was called an unprecedented global experiment in 1957 by Roger Revelle, the oil industry was warned directly in 1959 by Edward Teller, and more than half of our emissions happened after 1988.
5438 2018-11-13 16:48:19 ...Life isn’t only about profits, it’s also about protecting the well being of earth citizens, which is why we need the EPA. What is your definition of BETTER resource? If it’s a narrow definition of “Can make the most profit” then okay, Oil is “Better” but Solar is vastly....

5485 2018-11-13 16:44:44 Pre-heat oven to 450, put a 12-in oven-safe skillet in there if you have one. Combine 1 tbsp kosher salt and 1/2 tsp pepper. Pat chicken dry, rub with olive oil. Sprinkle salt mix all over chicken. Tie legs together. Put in skillet for 25-35 min, then turn off heat.

5487 2018-11-13 16:44:39 I#Gaelic creates employment and people pay taxes as a result of money made, so it benefits the whole country. Do you think oil only benefits Shetland and Aberdeen? Or that Harris Tweed only benefits the Western Isles. Or that whisky only benefits (largely) Islay and Speyside?

5489 2018-11-13 16:44:19 Did any of the oil bugs (can we call them that ? They call us gold bugs) call this wipout in crude oil ? Muh #OOTT
5490 2018-11-13 16:44:13 In related news, water is wet, the Pope is Catholic, bears shit in the woods and oil companies created climate-change disinformation for 30 years.
5491 2018-11-13 16:44:10 Have you tried warm olive oil? If you have a set of ear warmers (on a headband like the kind we make our kids wear when they are little) you could warm them and try that.
5492 2018-11-13 16:44:05 It didn't build those towers with revenue from tourism or trade. Just oil.
5493 2018-11-13 16:44:01 The maker of Cadbury chocolate bars, Oreo biscuits and Ritz crackers is accused of destroying tens of thousands of hectares of orangutan habitat in just two years for palm oil.

5496 2018-11-13 16:43:53 Yes. He should mention he’s there looking for new sources of revenue for Canada since his government sat back and watched our biggest resource get destroyed. Fort McMurray oil selling for $17 US  a barrel. While the enviros are singing this country is going down.
5497 2018-11-13 16:43:38 It’s called ‘profiteering’ I believe by the greedy oil companies.
5498 2018-11-13 16:43:26 Fuck sake @northernassist if your not gonna take the pacers out the back and shoot them just yet at least put some oil on the brakes. Not only is the vibration bone shaking but the brakes screeching is deafening
5499 2018-11-13 16:43:17 CBD oil works maybe better than that!
5500 2018-11-13 16:43:14 It sucks having to put tires and other random parts on an $800 beater vehicle. Like shit, these tires cost me $400, this oil change is $80, these control arms are $50 a piece and theres 8....like damn, thats $80 more than i even paid for the car... then i debate if its worth it

5507 2018-11-13 16:42:30 I know that, but mineral oil serves the same purpose and is a hell of a lot cheaper.
5508 2018-11-13 16:42:24 If you provide more of something into the purchasable supply, it decreases demand and in-turn the price usually drops. Oil is a global industry. Any new source or increase to output drops the price. So we'll lose billions to make a pipeline, and billions more on the sticker price
5509 2018-11-13 16:42:21 It is now built by the NRA, big oil, & other PACs.... just look at the mandatory financial filings of candidates (mostly Reps).

5515 2018-11-13 16:41:56 Sometimes it may seem like we are living out the movie "Groundhog Day,"  but Remember that your Hope, Focus, and Dedication can only bring about the age-old adage, "we reap what we sow". So keep on, keeping on and do the best you can!  (and try CBD oil as well as sleep) lol
5516 2018-11-13 16:41:49 Must be oil paint lol 
5517 2018-11-13 16:41:46 Modi minister have been lying that 1.75 Lakhs crores of oil bond is paid recently which was old due. As a result petrol diesel gas prices are not reduced. All lies. Bond is old practice and was paid by all previous Govt including Atal ji.

5519 2018-11-13 16:41:40 Two different things. 

What are your thoughts on him dismantiling the EPA and filling it with oil and coal execs? How is that "draining the swamp" ?

Seems like between this and majority of his other appointees (wall St execs) he's overflowed the swamp.
5520 2018-11-13 16:41:39 Aside from that, how would they get all the fuel to burn the bodies? Did they deforest the entirety of Eastern Europe? They surely didn’t take from their wartime supplies of gasoline/oil to burn all these bodies, so where did it come from?
5521 2018-11-13 16:41:39 It is possible to make @Oreo cookies without palm oil - all it takes is their desire to put our planet above their profit. It's time to #boycot their cookies until they change their recipe! #TasteTheDestruction #DropDirtyPalmOil #Oreo #RecipeForDisaster @GreenpeaceUK
5522 2018-11-13 16:41:32 I dont eat that. They use Peanut oil.
5523 2018-11-13 16:41:28 Looking to buy some EOG or an ETF, not in oil at this time. Feeling like the down turn could be an opportunity.
5524 2018-11-13 16:41:23 It’s a conspiracy Westminster are take all the profits the Tories are lying the English are keeping our money etc etc . Sad fact is Salmond promised us we would all be rich because of our oil...thank goodness Scotland did not believe him
5525 2018-11-13 16:41:23 I just want to eat two loaves of italian bread. I want to make one into cheesy garlic bread, and the other I’d make yummy seasoned olive oil to dip it into asjflskdkls MAYBE MAKE SOME CHUNKY MARINARA TOO FUCk so hungRY

5527 2018-11-13 16:41:12 You can use kale in pesto recipes to replace basil or spinach, mix it with olive oil and healthy nuts or seeds and blend it into goop. Tasty with rice, pasta, fish, or just slathered on a nice bit of meat. Or boil it, freeze in little blocks and throw into sauces, stews or rice
5528 2018-11-13 16:41:11 We should respect the the snake oil salesman who wants to give us GENOCIDE AGAINST people I disagree with!
5529 2018-11-13 16:41:05 Whats this I hear about you helping Big Oil suppress the electric car, except a typing mishap saw you actually suppress the electric cat?
5530 2018-11-13 16:41:05 They can murder people and you cover for them.  But oil prices is where you draw the line.
5531 2018-11-13 16:40:59 Body butter

5532 2018-11-13 16:40:58 The @IEA, in their New Policies Scenarios, has US oil production increasing to 18.5 mmbbl/d by 2025, oil sands up to 3.4 mmbbl/d by then.  40% increase in US production, 25% increase in oil sands from 2017-2025.

5534 2018-11-13 16:40:53 It's scandalous! The usual excuse is they buy months ahead so it takes time to filter down to the pumps so how come when oil goes up the price at the pumps goes up straight away! Surely that should be a slow rise, it's just complete greed and sadly we have no option but to pay.

5536 2018-11-13 16:40:39 One million barrels of foreign oil/day R imported mostly for refineries in EASTERN Canada. All this while Quebec militants crap on western Canada oil. Looking forward to a Conservative govt in Alberta to further battle this travesty

5538 2018-11-13 16:40:30 Most Nigerian do. They think being an oil producer means that we are very rich. Some think being better than Congo is an achievement. To some others, corruption is the reason for our poverty and once you eliminate it, Nigeria will be like "Small London", hence Buhari.
5539 2018-11-13 16:40:30 But the benefits are not passed on to customers by oil companies
5540 2018-11-13 16:40:26 No; they may be improving on the palm oil front, but they still employ exploitative water practices. So it makes sense they’d support Fox.
Who needs @Nestle? Organic chocolate chip cookies and other homemade treats make the holidays sweeter, anyway.

5544 2018-11-13 16:40:18 How much had it gone up in the preceding two years and could it have to do with the naturally increasing price of raw materials like oil.gas. to blame credit is easy. So in your words Brexit is fab for the economy as we have full employment for the first time in twenty years
5545 2018-11-13 16:40:16 And sun burn from using baby oil to get a tan. That may be more of an 80s thing?

5548 2018-11-13 16:40:06 in Leuven bij Jenna  na 8 maanden doet mijn helix nog elke dag pijn, en na 1 maand voelde ik de tepelpiercing al niet meer! (Behalve als je er blijft aanhangen met je handdoek natuurlijk ) ik gebruik ook steeds tea tree oil om dagelijks te verzorgen!

5553 2018-11-13 16:39:32 Oh right, so companies will just abandon the oil because it would become Scottish oil and not "British" oil? Righty oh!
5554 2018-11-13 16:39:31 And staying long #usdcad. Targeting 1.35 and 1.3750. Household debt thru the roof and housing bubble in Canada plus #nafta plus #oil lower plus #Trudeau deficit equals higher usdcad
5555 2018-11-13 16:39:23 Je ne me risquerais pas à lui donner une leçon sur sa mémoire mais parfois nous mélangeons un peu les éléments. Se rappeler du prix du gaz oil sous Nicolas Sarkozy et l’occulter durant le mandat de Hollande, j’avoue que je n’y aurai pas pensé
5556 2018-11-13 16:39:17 Incidentally, the tanker "ban" doesn't affect tankers carrying 12,500 tons or less of oil
5557 2018-11-13 16:39:14 Oil&gas did everything by themselves simply by doing nothing in the last 50 yrs about something they know would have consequences on a global scale
5558 2018-11-13 16:39:12 From PSNI: reports of heating oil thefts this week. Any suspicious activity such as unmarked oil tankers or vans/cars with plastic oil drums call 101. 
Some reports have been at night but can easily be committed in daylight as an oil delivery lorry may not arouse suspicion.
5559 2018-11-13 16:39:07 Tire pressure low, 2500 miles past oil change, gas tank empty, weird noise from engine. *turns music up* It’s fine, I’m fine.
5560 2018-11-13 16:38:50 They seem to be placing blame on her. She didn't place herself and her babies in the oil.

5562 2018-11-13 16:38:41 We shall not neglect the oil and gas sector while doing all this but also fine tune it, restore all our refinaries to full capacity. 
How can an oil producing nation be importing refined products? We shall build refinaries and export petroleum products to other countries
5563 2018-11-13 16:38:33 Oil your cheeks
5564 2018-11-13 16:38:29 @GreenpeaceUK is there an up to date list of all products that contain unsustainable palm oil? There have been a few circling around all with extreme variation in information (some companies listed as very sustainable in one then completely unsustainable in another)
5565 2018-11-13 16:38:25 You’re stretching my knowledge of Indian electricity markets (why not ask about oil…?!) But to 2027, the capacity additions are more-or-less only what's under construction currently. After 2025, generation increases by 40% and capacity by 65% to 2040
5566 2018-11-13 16:38:14 I clearly said "relatively benign", which is an accurate statement.  What is ignorant is your claims that pumping salt water is like drilling for oil or implying that it has any similar impact by the comparison.
5567 2018-11-13 16:38:05 Great Scott. Please talk about #Oil too
Time to buy $UCO ???
@ReformedBroker @petenajarian @jonnajarian 
You should invite @Elliott_Gue to join soon. He knows the oil markets like nobody else.
5568 2018-11-13 16:37:52 Frickin Kansas. Believe me, I've been tempted to go to Colorado. Hopefully, with a new governor, we'll be able to at least get medical marijuana. For now, so can get is hemp oil. It doesn't do much for me beyond helping with some  anxiety.
5569 2018-11-13 16:37:49 Ladies it’s time to do hot oil treatments and deep conditioners
5570 2018-11-13 16:37:47 that sucks even more . wish you the best of luck mom  i’ll send peppermint oil for the back pain
5571 2018-11-13 16:37:44 "Data is to this century what oil was to the last” says purveyor of data storage devices. Colour me surprised.
5572 2018-11-13 16:37:42 This ad is informative, not political. What is "political" is that the BBC refuses to air it. Thank you for sharing this, @janeosanders. I'll never buy anything containing palm oil again, because I do care about the destruction of the rain forests.

This EV explosion is classic.

5577 2018-11-13 16:37:12 I smell like a whole bottle of tea tree oil 
5578 2018-11-13 16:36:42 This is ridiculous ... you’re arguing that the White House can dictate how the press ask questions and what they ask about ... sure would make it a lot easier to lie your way into an oil war wouldn’t it ?
5579 2018-11-13 16:36:38 No makeup remover? No worries! Grab extra virgin olive oil out of your kitchen! Olive oil is natural, moisturizing &amp; will remove makeup.
5580 2018-11-13 16:36:36 Sustainable palm oil still allows deforestation stop greenwashing
5581 2018-11-13 16:36:34 You're concerned with Saudi Arabia cutting oil production but not cutting up people's bodies. Got it.
5582 2018-11-13 16:36:19 @askjillian Try using CBD Oil works wonders for pain. You can get it with or without THC(which is what gets you high) I use it for severe Cluster Headaches, just put several drops under your tongue hold for a minute then swallow. You can get it at any dispensary.

5584 2018-11-13 16:35:49 JHC

I think Trump's well oiled machine desperately needs another infusion of oil.

About 50,000 gallons may do the trick.
5585 2018-11-13 16:35:48 Yep, those are both great oils especially for the winter season. Just be careful with using lemon oil on your skin. 

I like to put them in a spray bottle with water and shake it up, you can use ACV too
5586 2018-11-13 16:35:46 How can U.S. markets diverge so much from this oil drop?  Seems that gap has to close soon.
5587 2018-11-13 16:35:42 Ojo lo q aumento el gas oil y la soja valia casi 10.000 la tn y ahora 8800 $

5589 2018-11-13 16:35:36 Thanks for your response. As I said in my tweet though, this partnership has increased consumers' understanding of the PRODUCTION issues surrounding palm oil. That has to be a good thing?

5591 2018-11-13 16:35:31 I know all of you want to forget this little fact! Hillary won the populous vote by 3M voters! America slip in an oil spot because 77 electoral college voters poured way too much oil on the floor. Knowing how it has gone down, those that didn't, would gladly now, or they're lying
5592 2018-11-13 16:35:20 /ES -- Yesterday felt like some funds were liquidating.  Today felt like that was continuing until oil stabilized and the dollar started to sell off.  The $AAPL setup was text book:  pre-mark slump with a $5 rally.  Now they'll try to pin and keep it above 2750.
5593 2018-11-13 16:35:16 中におじさんが入ってる気配はしたのでしょうか………（？
5594 2018-11-13 16:35:10 Incredible mashallah. The stronger the dinar the lower the prices will be and it won't be small changes insha'Allah, 

Especially when we see the dollar at a reasonable level, 3-3.5 which will happen sooner or later if oil stays where it is and production continues
5595 2018-11-13 16:35:10 Usually I fry it in the pan with some olive oil and then pair it with rice and veegtables and I'm good to go
5596 2018-11-13 16:35:05 That's NOT how oil pricing WORKS!!  Geesh!!

5609 2018-11-13 16:33:58 Hi Chris, the other thing I just realised - how do you go about justifying allowing people to advertise products made with unsustainable palm oil? Or is that outside your remit so beyond you needing to give a s***?

5611 2018-11-13 16:33:53 I thought it was Iceland’s own label products going Palm Oil free, other brands (which they stock) are not. No good berating Iceland for other manufacturers actions.
5612 2018-11-13 16:33:46 The ban only affects a small portion of BC's coast where waters are too choppy to support big oil tankers. Do some research. The ban won't be overturned.
5613 2018-11-13 16:33:42 .@MarkWarner says data is new oil and social media companies have market incentive to hold onto our data which they get for free. You are the product @YahooFinance #YahooAMS
5614 2018-11-13 16:33:38 Dubai hardly depends on oil for economic growth. Dubai is driven by trade and tourism.
5615 2018-11-13 16:33:37 When I was a kid in grade school 60+ years ago, guess what they used to show us on "AV Fridays"? Propaganda films from oil companies. I learned all about shale and slant drilling and all the good stuff at 10 years of age. It started early, even back then. @albertarabbit
5616 2018-11-13 16:33:32 I need to stop playing and get my oil changed.

5618 2018-11-13 16:33:27 Was I supposed to go for baked beans? (Have been accumulating extra virgin olive oil and prosecco)
5619 2018-11-13 16:33:24 No no, quería decir que el coche es el 30% de la demanda de oil. Y también lo que dices, la flota electrica sigue siendo enana. Además que en los emergentes cada vez puede acceder a un coche y estoy bastante seguro que no será eléctrico.

5621 2018-11-13 16:33:11 Sweat, I hate tiny keyboards.  Actually they very much are. Would you want the person that changed your oil last, to be in charge of battling the California wildfires right now? Would you want them heading the UN or running a pharmaceutical company?
5622 2018-11-13 16:33:09 You don't need geology majors either if everything was poofed into existence 6000 years ago, and your state has no oil to find.
5623 2018-11-13 16:33:08 Trump: CA Libs want to “save the forests” and believe in “climate change”!! They think I shouldn’t be drilling oil in the ocean!!CONSTANTLY whining about the stupid environment and breathing “clean” air!,

Plus they’re nearly all Democrats which is the REAL reason I’m pissed.
5624 2018-11-13 16:33:02 Ask the doctor about CBd oil. Maybe it can help. prayers up
5625 2018-11-13 16:33:00 Have you tried CBD oil instead? You put it under your tongue and it works in like 10 mins. Really really good for you too!!!
5626 2018-11-13 16:32:50 I love peppermint oil I love the smell, the euphoric after effects, and it’s good for the skin
5627 2018-11-13 16:32:49 Anyone know how to get oil off car keys??
5628 2018-11-13 16:32:49 Somebody come get my car and take it to get a oil change

5630 2018-11-13 16:32:30 He needs the Extreme oil and the Holy oil. The Extreme oil breaks addictions on the 1st dose. The Holy oil repairs the body, keeps addictions at bay, and heals the damage done. God bless. I will pray for your son!

5632 2018-11-13 16:32:13 Are you aware that revenue from oil is *tax* on oil companies’ profits? And that Swinney begged Osborne to slash that tax when the price slumped? No, you probably aren’t.
5633 2018-11-13 16:32:12 All you #lefties are crazy! @realDonaldTrump has restored our international standing. No more #China or #Iran pissing down our throats during  #Obama years. You all speculate over photo ops and #MSM spincrap. #Russia is a pest at best. We can bring them to their knees w our #Oil
5634 2018-11-13 16:32:04 Trump embraced rigging markets to accomplish his goals at the expense of oil producers, miners, farmers, investors. Not sure MAGA works with collusion between Treasury/Fed/Banks & HFT The fiat Keynesian foundation of our financial system is fragile, vulnerable & now being tested.
5635 2018-11-13 16:32:00 Coconut oil can easily make her skin glow-rious  it’s just dry.
5636 2018-11-13 16:31:52 If you see $DOW TRANSPORTATION moving over 10545 is a great signal of an upturn for USMarket, Heading $DOW65 aver 8545,
With pressure on $OIL prices, $FED tomorrow has to ease his comments on rising rates after Dic.
5637 2018-11-13 16:31:51 Really, $100 million a day in lost oil revenue, perhaps take a look at any oil or gas stock chart over the last 5 years.  Compare the TSX to the Dow again last 5 years. 8% unemployment in Alberta, $9 billion deficits, $90 billion in debt.  You should ask yourself who is blind?
5638 2018-11-13 16:31:41 Nananana! Pyaj, lebu, lawnka ar noon! Other slaadslood I have line they are had - even in refined manner - with olive oil dressing :)
5639 2018-11-13 16:31:40 While CBD oil doesn't work for everyone, I've seen many positive reports of it being helpful for anxiety relief. There's no guarantee a doctor will tell you about a cure. They're only practicing medicine. Not looking for cures.

5641 2018-11-13 16:31:24 If I live on the coast and you live inland and you vote to stick a pipeline through my house to run oil to the port on the other side, then geography certainly matters. If I can't be assured that won't happen, why would I federate with you?
5642 2018-11-13 16:31:24 the Olive Oil one has never failed me. We in this thang for life 
5643 2018-11-13 16:31:23 Uptick in oil may have run its course for now $DWT
5644 2018-11-13 16:31:15 Water solution: Just like oil pipelines have a National Water Pipelines so in areas of flood that water can be transferred to areas of drought. Helps lessen the flood & helps out drought regions. Win win.
5645 2018-11-13 16:31:14 starting by not building oil pipelines and respecting the environment which a lot of our tourism industry relies on, would be a good start.
5646 2018-11-13 16:31:10 Stop selling them arms... Get your other mates to stop selling them arms. Stop buying their oil. Right, what's next on your to do list Jeremy?
5647 2018-11-13 16:31:08 What documents r u talking about, Just go through Biggest arms deal of all time "Al-Yamamah" (Oil for Arms) which also is a so called "Govt. To Govt." Deal to know more about how things work in arms procurement. "Govt. To Govt." Deal doesn't mean that there can't be a middle man.

5660 2018-11-13 16:29:52 What a great take, tell people in a democracy they can only vote between two shitty people, and then pretend that only one party is funded by big oil...
5661 2018-11-13 16:29:40 She has a hell of a game plan. Her dad was just for oil and gas because he got paid millions, Georgy Junior just wanted to avenge daddy with a war. I like how she grabs an opportunity and runs with it. She is building a career with impressive accomplishments. I'd vote for her.
5662 2018-11-13 16:29:36 it's whipped egg yoke and like lemon juice, salt and oil.... think garlic powder too

5666 2018-11-13 16:29:21 Haha, yeah, I went to one of your "Ten-Minute oil change" locations yesterday, and didn't have time to wait the hour plus in line. I was at the desk for 5 minutes and no one even came to talk to me.


5667 2018-11-13 16:29:09 Looking forward to the day Trump Tweets don't cause oil price fluctuations. Worse market manipulator than OPEC is.
5668 2018-11-13 16:29:04 How about some warm oil poured over your naked body
5669 2018-11-13 16:29:01 Be specific. I'm not trolling Im calling out your bullshit. Oil jobs for low level employees bring 100k.
5670 2018-11-13 16:28:52 I use vitamin c serum and Radha rosehip oil and history of whoo (Korean skincare products) and then retinol cream at night
5671 2018-11-13 16:28:50 One area where I am often over-read is the issue of "imminent." And also, that my focus remains on the oil industry. What is imminent is a observable impact on the growth prospects for oil consumption--and yes, that risk very much is now, at the front end of transition.
5672 2018-11-13 16:28:50 Nah I got somebody who do my oil change for the freeski...you can get my brakes changed

5676 2018-11-13 16:28:39 Hi Karen, this is a really important issue and we’ve been at the forefront of driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years. We’re on track to meeting our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
5677 2018-11-13 16:28:38 Can't see how the shale boom benefits from lower oil prices. This reversal has been epic if shorting but can't see how this becomes an environment where companies sanction large investments for future field drilling & exploration. At some point we'll get the very reverse trade
5678 2018-11-13 16:28:29 I just got back form the supermarket where I tried to buy a non dairy butter substitute. They all contained palm oil, so I came out with butter. One product said "sustainable palm oil" oh yeah I don't believe it. I bet there is a black market in forged sustainability certificates
5679 2018-11-13 16:28:28 My doctor says to start with the 1% thc and then go up until you find the perfect mix for you. So happy that Texas will allow you to use cbd oil to treat your MS.

5689 2018-11-13 16:26:58 The next decent RNS will push the share price up by 30 percent. Then people will sell again. Merry go round. The only way this share goes up considerably is once big oil come in. At the moment it's a trading share after an Rns. 
I'm invested for the long term only now.

5696 2018-11-13 16:26:18 Seriously @Oreo, you’re using palm oil in your cookies?! What’s the plan to stop? Or move to a sustainable source? If people knew the truth they’d stop buying, and rightly so. #PalmOil #PalmOilFree
5697 2018-11-13 16:26:18 Aye I got the connect on the beard growth oil. Lmk if you need some
5698 2018-11-13 16:26:16 But palm oil uses less land than the alternatives and we seem to be unable to produce enough for our 'needs' locally (or maybe don't like using lard).  Main issue is palm oil to mix with diesel to meet anti global warming targets. Ironic.

5734 2018-11-13 16:22:33 Ironically, the Market is now concerned that the lower cost of oil is because of global slowdown. I really don't care about global slowdown; it is what we Americans pay at the pump and finally may just get a break with that barrel cost decreasing.  Bravo @realDonaldTrump

5742 2018-11-13 16:21:44 We need all forms of energy to develop, not just renewables. Oil demand is here to stay and we need to get fair market value for what we produce. To lower our emissions we should be focusing on coal to gas conversions, not killing our own oil industry.
5743 2018-11-13 16:21:37 lol, everyone expecting, Erdo and crew can't keep their mouth shut, was talking about Kurds in control of some of the Euphrates oil, it's also a good chance for Puty to get Erdo and crew deeper on the Nto blacklist
5744 2018-11-13 16:21:36 4/4 in Oct a person received hospital treatment for a milk allergy after eating what should have been a dairy-free cupcake.
There was also anaphylaxis to coconut oil coating profiteroles and a reaction from cross contamination on deli nuts in cheese needing antihistamines

5751 2018-11-13 16:20:56 Yes girl, you have to wrap your hair in a bun. The oil bila you peluh akan jatuh to your face especially those comedogenic oil macam coconut oil
5752 2018-11-13 16:20:55 @DiMartinoBooth Is this oil move showing us that global growth is not just slowing but tanking?

5755 2018-11-13 16:20:40 So you don’t use public services (of the kind you’d have to pay for in Norway, with its oil fund)?
5756 2018-11-13 16:20:38 Tell them to put everything they lost last night on the Oil tonight. When they win tell them to kiss your ass
5757 2018-11-13 16:20:36 1 day left to protect the #rainforest, #orangutans, and #palmoil workers from greedy companies like @Indofood! RT to tell @RSPOtweets, the global palm oil body, to vote to stop certifying destructive palm oil in its new Principles and Criteria #RSPO #RT16
5758 2018-11-13 16:20:29 Maybe you used too much?? I have oily skin, but I don’t think I’d use it as an everyday primer. It’s meant to suck up extra oil, but it probably isn’t good for everyday use.
5759 2018-11-13 16:20:28 'I thought I needed to run and find somebody to love but all I needed was some coconut oil'
5760 2018-11-13 16:20:21 I just want to say there are too many stupid Washington state voters. Idk how 1.5 million voted for big oil and big soda corporations. What a shame. At least they said fuck off to the NRA
5761 2018-11-13 16:20:08 I really like #Nutella but having watched the #Iceland advert and the effect that #palmoil is having would rather use something with less oil - does anyone know of an alternative please?
5762 2018-11-13 16:20:08 I love being an independent adult boss bitch lady who takes care of herself but I also love when I happen to mention to my mom that I am taking my car to get an oil change and she says that I should put it all on her Firestone account and she’ll take care of it for me
5763 2018-11-13 16:20:06 RT to pressure @RSPOtweets, the #palmoil industry's self-proclaimed regulator to protect the #planet, #animals and #workers from destructive palm oil companies. It’s time it updated its rules to make palm oil truly sustainable #RSPO #RT16
5764 2018-11-13 16:20:03 My fave is Rise brand CBD rich morsels, the turmeric and matcha-mint flavors, I melt one in almond milk on the stove and mix in bulletproof MCT oil + marine collagen, whisk and drink like a latte!

5766 2018-11-13 16:19:33 We don't support the use of Palm Oil, so it’s good to see this issue getting such enormous exposure on the back of @IcelandFoods being banned from using Greenpeace’s film and promising to stop using  palm oil as an ingredient in all its own-label products by the end of 2018.
5767 2018-11-13 16:19:21 So sorry to disappoint, Kristen! As a replacement, we would recommend giving our Argan Oil of Morocco Collection a try.

5776 2018-11-13 16:18:52 So, if they want to get oil to market, do it. Do we need to buy their driilinf gear for them too?we are already giving them the oil for nothing.

5790 2018-11-13 16:17:42 Good, let's take lavender essential oil for example. Main constituents: linalool (30.6 %), linalyl acetate (14.2 %), geraniol (5.3 %), β-caryophyllene (4.7 %), lavandulyl acetate (4.4 %). All these are chemicals.

Linalool is both irritant and allergenic.
5791 2018-11-13 16:17:40 Would be better to meet clean energy rather than greedy oil companies profits
5792 2018-11-13 16:17:34 They're super flammable because of the oils in the trees. As they burn, and the oil expands, they can explode.

They were also imported for railroad ties I think.
5793 2018-11-13 16:17:31 Please get those caged children returned to their parents. Clean water and air. No fracking. No aelling monuments to Big Oil. Love and care for our lands and people! Education! Avoid Russian money! Thank you with all my support!

5795 2018-11-13 16:17:17 Right, I've had it. I'm off to buy Plastic Straws and Palm Oil. 

Any other suggestions?
5796 2018-11-13 16:17:12 Em tese, e por fundamento, a correlação deve ser inversa. Ou seja, oil pra baixo implica em dólar pra cima, e vice-versa. Não gosto de ficar me fiando muito em correlações históricas porque correlações históricas podem ser quebradas em função de liquidez. Vimos isso esse ano.
5797 2018-11-13 16:17:10 A prediction for IMO 2020

Demand for 0.5% ULSFO will be much less than predicted. Due to the possibility of many Stability and Compatability issues as a bunker fuel, ship owners will need time to be confident in the product. Marine Gas Oil will be the goto product.

5803 2018-11-13 16:16:39 The tweet wasn’t celebrating a person, it was celebrating the idea that “we do what we have to do” without truly reflecting on Veterans Day and who that man in the picture was as a person. And “what we have to do” is kill innocent people over oil.
5804 2018-11-13 16:16:36  hm... good question... maybe just dip it in chocolate mint oil a bit :)
5805 2018-11-13 16:16:16 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
5806 2018-11-13 16:16:13 yeah ppl been doing that.. all u gotta do is make the butter or oil..
5807 2018-11-13 16:16:11 Rump's a follower not a leader.  What's to follow?  Russian oil and gas they would like to sell to W Europe.  If USA oil exploration goes to Russia then they'll need hotels and entertainments (ho's and bedrooms) and that has been the Rump family occupation for 3 generations now.
5808 2018-11-13 16:16:09 We now sell CBD Hemp oil
5809 2018-11-13 16:16:07 I was thinking more like an oil pen, at a low temp the pull is mostly vapor and doesn't have the burnt taste smoke has which helps w/sensory , but obviously unless it's the higher temp cannabinoids doing it, low temp vaping isn't going to stop a chemical reaction in your head.
5810 2018-11-13 16:16:05 Probably used baby oil 
5811 2018-11-13 16:15:52 Hey Subhankar, great question. It's normal to lose anywhere between 5-30 beard hairs a day, and sometimes more when you reach terminal length. I would suggest to keep brushing and applying Beard Oil as long as you're not noticing significant changes in hair loss.

5812 2018-11-13 16:15:52 Let's say they stop with palm oil, that farm land isn't going to be given back the wild animals inhabiting it. They will start farming something else.
5813 2018-11-13 16:15:48 Big oil will make lot's of money, which they won't share with their workers, and will continue to destroy the environment. All the average American gets out of it is dirty air and water.

5815 2018-11-13 16:15:34 #PoliticsLive discussing @rangtanforest, @Anna_Soubry finally changed mind on ad promoting palm oil free xmas. Richard @IcelandWalker spoke of witnessing environmental degradation.

5820 2018-11-13 16:15:25 Maybe an entomological exploration of “ techie” covering why we’d use it to describe sales guys in SF, but prob not a PhD Computer scientist writing oil exploration algos in Houston?

 It seems the word has evolved to fit a cultural aesthetic applied pejoratively to The Other.
5821 2018-11-13 16:15:16 Similar reports surfaced 10-15 Years back regarding Desi Gee/ Kadwa Tel vs Refined oil.
And similar corporate backed studies/Researchers claimed fortune brand oils are good for heart but in reality it's the other way around.
5822 2018-11-13 16:15:16 すごい、、
5823 2018-11-13 16:15:15 Sure, but my feeling is that we could stay in bear/correction market for the rest of the year. Quoting you 'buy at right price not cheapest'.
I posted that I started buying crude oil inverse etf-s on Nov.2. Crude oil price, in my opionion, reflects the market sentiment.

5852 2018-11-13 16:13:07 Thanks for the response. Encouraged, but why aren't your products stickered as using sustainable palm oil. Also why not use alternative vegetable fats? Is it because you use the cheap option?
5853 2018-11-13 16:12:58 Yes, it creates 45k a year jobs while taking away 100k oil related jobs. Quit with your "it creates jobs" crap.

5866 2018-11-13 16:11:55 Find it strange given the recent publicity that Iceland are not in the bright green (Supermarkets). This is specific to Palm Oil... For perspective. there are those in the green that use ingredients, although not harmful to the environment are known to be harmful to people.
5867 2018-11-13 16:11:51 Thanks for the feedback. Encourage you to focus not exclusively on this thread, but the larger treatment of the subject in the Oil Fall series. I explain how damaging the end of growth (which sets in well before decline) can be to the extractive commodity industries.
5868 2018-11-13 16:11:50 Mean to tell me they were able to add the removal of the ACA mandate & open up Alaska to more oil drilling, but couldn’t change the language of Their own Rep tax plan to make the middle class tax cuts permanent?! And its somehow the Dems fault?! Boy, bye!

5872 2018-11-13 16:11:31 What does it mean when they say a girl is an oil and gas ..does it mean she studied petroleum engineering ??
5873 2018-11-13 16:11:26 The more OPEC pumps, the cheaper the oil, the more oil related job losses in America. American Oil workers were begging for an OPEC cut just 2 years ago.

5877 2018-11-13 16:11:16 The #orangutans could be extinct within a generation >> destructive #palmoil companies like @Indofood are to blame. RT to tell members of palm oil certification org @RSPOtweets to commit to ‘No #Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ #RT16 #RSPO

5882 2018-11-13 16:10:54 Now, tepid growth projections, waivers granted to several buyers of Iranian crude and robust supply have sent oil prices into a tailspin. The plunge has spread to other assets, with copper and gold down last week and US stocks dropping.
5883 2018-11-13 16:10:53 That's why we're so excited about the @vegware #CloseTheLoop scheme to help with that! But failing being able to compost, Vegware are great because they are made from plants not plastics meaning the use of renewable materials saves finite oil/resources unlike bio-plastics!

5887 2018-11-13 16:10:46 Oil

Equal legs at $63 Brent

No rush to enter crude longs yet

Oct monthly = Nov monthly swing

Will be watching OPEC meeting like a hawk

If they cut prod by over 1m barrels per day then oil price should recover
5888 2018-11-13 16:10:40 Who knew rubbing oil on ya head would be this therapeutic

5894 2018-11-13 16:10:19 Í dag lærði ég um "Gutter Oil" sem er notað í matargerð sumstaðar í Asíu. Hérna, ekki gúggla þetta nema þú viljir eyðileggja matarlistina fyrir vikuna.
5895 2018-11-13 16:10:08 Good, but we are talking about oil.
5896 2018-11-13 16:10:03 ぼくに言わせればワセリンすら食用だよ。
5897 2018-11-13 16:09:55 coconut oil is good too
5898 2018-11-13 16:09:54 Mine also needs a oil change 
5899 2018-11-13 16:09:54 Oil’s swift decline marks its entry into a club of commodities......that have been flashing warnings about the economy this year. Copper has tumbled 18% in 2018, while sugar is down more than 15%. Raw materials are used by economists as a barometer for global growth.
5900 2018-11-13 16:09:50 I suspect I'd be lynched for suggesting that. With the roll toaster first with a little coconut oil is really nice.

5903 2018-11-13 16:09:48 Yeah!!! Finally laid my hands on 'Oil, Politics and violence'

I'm going to be buried in it for the next few days.
5904 2018-11-13 16:09:46 Without snakes no snake oil
5905 2018-11-13 16:09:44 Oil market is very interesting. Although it will never happen all it takes is a OPEC cut of 10% and oil would rocket to $100+ leading to massive increase in revenue for OPEC nations.
5906 2018-11-13 16:09:40 おめでとうございますー！！
5907 2018-11-13 16:09:38 Macron has engaged a lot of reforms. They are unpopular: social status, retirement age, lower pension fund (France has the higher pension), cuts in advantages, oil taxes...
He may be right or wrong, but reforms are needed and he won’t be popular by doing them
5908 2018-11-13 16:09:35 Madness is when one buys anointing oil for protection, from a Pastor with armed bodyguards 
5909 2018-11-13 16:09:33 Oil coming down @Asad_Umar 
Hope for PTI and pakistan. Lets try to take adv an reduce import bills
5910 2018-11-13 16:09:30 Am out of CBD oil and gfp I can barely move my hands. They’re hecka stiff
5911 2018-11-13 16:09:30 they’ll burn through that oil/gas surplus while simultaneously trying to destroy oil/gas industry.
5912 2018-11-13 16:09:25 Save the #orangutans! For its NEW set of principles & criteria, I want global #palmoil body @RSPOtweets to vote for ‘No #Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ in palm oil, and to hold members like @Indofood to account #RT16 #RSPO
5913 2018-11-13 16:09:16 @Blakkrasta this your debate on the #blakkpot should be repeated in the  languages u can speak #TaxiDriverShow we are cursed anytime prices of  crude oil goes up, prices of our commodities goes up @zylofon1021fm @NAkufoAddo meanwhile we produce crude oil here
5914 2018-11-13 16:09:13 shop at waitrose co-op m&s and tesco because they use palm oil responsibly but dont shop at aldi because they dont seems like a hard lesson to teach a family of 5 living on the bread line
5915 2018-11-13 16:09:11 I dislike reports like these. Their effect is the false idea that these supplements have no value. Vitamin D is taken for bone health and to compensate for negligible sunshine exposure. Fish oil is important for brain and nerve health.

5918 2018-11-13 16:09:06 For y'all folks who don't believe in letting y'all cars warm up please at least get a fresh oil change and think about switching to synthetic oil if you don't use it already. I promise your engine will do better in the cold

5941 2018-11-13 16:07:23 @bakewithstork  I love baking and often buy your products, but the use of palm oil is increasingly distructive to the environment, please could you advise me on if the palm oil you use is ethically sourced? #savetheforests
5942 2018-11-13 16:07:23 How much palm oil does it contain? Any orangutans killed to make this chocolate?

5951 2018-11-13 16:06:46 “ We need more energy and that means diversifying our sources of supply away from the OPEC countries. Yes, it means more efficient automobiles. But it also means more exploration and development of oil and natural gas here in our own country.”

5954 2018-11-13 16:06:36 Looks like dollar strength with raising interest rate trending along with crude oil weakness are the points most concerning gold and subsequently silver prices.
5955 2018-11-13 16:06:32 the palm oil industry is one of the leading causes of deforestation so do your best to reduce your consumption or buy for ethically-sourced companies. It's hard tho bcuz

EVERYTHING HAS PALM OIL
5956 2018-11-13 16:06:31 motor oil isnt for drinking

5960 2018-11-13 16:06:23 We must stop deforestation. Totally.  Not just because Iconic Animals endangered. Extinction wise. But we our world won't survive.  Life as we know it won't survive. Trees Breath. For us. Don't need Palm oil.
5961 2018-11-13 16:06:14 I feel your pain. I have them myself. Whenever I come across someone with similar experiences, I feel like I have to share that Nature's Bounty cold-pressed Flax Seed oil (2400mgs) nightly has drastically reduced my symptoms and kept me from having to go on Rx meds. Best wishes
5962 2018-11-13 16:06:13 That was not a lie that my guy was FACT. Low revenue due to oil at low price and low tax revenue due to low tax base FG was printing money or generating revenue from where?
5963 2018-11-13 16:06:01 Hi i worked 42 hours in 3 days, have taken all my normal sleep meds plus ibuprofen PM, have my heating pad& lavendar oil...& all i can hear is VEEG and tube feed beeps.

5964 2018-11-13 16:05:58 That's the business of the French, isn't it.. or are you Emperor of the world now.. dictating even oil output of different countries and everything else.
5965 2018-11-13 16:05:57 if all the cheap shops are using palm oil is it really ruining the planet or is it saving people from the claws of poverty
5966 2018-11-13 16:05:52 @karinagould 2 of 2. I also support building pipelines to tidewater so we get world price, I believe in maximizing oil/gas exports, I believe in using proceeds to build leading renewable industry and I believe we Canadians need to eliminate our own use of oil/gas via education

5977 2018-11-13 16:05:20 @realDonaldTrump No,the oil prices are just fine, I don't know if the oil grows back and to have a sustainable planet others need to understand that traveling for just the sake of boredom without a goal, unlike relaxing for traveling is not a goal that is good for the environment

6003 2018-11-13 16:03:14 At oil at $40 where was buhari getting the money to bail states out. At $40 that means revenue was low and since the FG is the only entity license to print money it was bailing states by printing more money against low revenue leading to inflation

6019 2018-11-13 16:02:06 Great news.

Mind you the article has oil at $85 a barrel.

It has already entered a bear market since then and is now hovering around $70 a barrel.
6020 2018-11-13 16:01:55 It’s b/c we gave ‘em nuclear weaponry for the sole purpose of their acting as our geopolitical ally in the theft of MidEast oil. If Israel didn’t serve that one self-serving American purpose, American imperialists wouldn’t give a damn abt ‘em, & Israel wouldn’t have nukes either.
6021 2018-11-13 16:01:53 OPEC thought they were giving Trump an education on oil.  Sad they didn't realize that NON-OPEC is as efficient as ever, and hedged for any downturn.  Believe me, this isn't 2014 in the slightest bit

6053 2018-11-13 16:00:07 Hi! A regular viewer of your content from India. I have a query, when I brush my beard and use beard oil I notice quite an amount of beard hair loss. Should I keep using beard oil and brushing or should I stop and let it grow as it is? @beardbrand
6054 2018-11-13 16:00:06 Honestly if it’s to hard to brush out conditioner in it and leave it in for  awhile then start from the bottom or coconut oil I feel like I’m giving you facts everyone knows but

6064 2018-11-13 15:59:44 When a global bust hits later next yr we'll see oil fall below the 2016 low of $26 and trade below $20 and possibly down to $10. But I agree it is probably due for a bounce.
6065 2018-11-13 15:59:33 Ever put cartridge oil inna wood
6066 2018-11-13 15:59:31 Except the govt gave our royalties away inform of grants & tax cuts to oil producers. If we had a govt working for Canadians instead of oil companies (Liberals as guilty as cons) we would have 78% royalties on oil & benefits for regular folks, as in Norway.

6071 2018-11-13 15:59:15 + a web of interests that drive unsustainable development. Massive demand for cheapest plant oil, high value of rainforest hardwoods, a plantation crop that declines in production over time and a long break in income if replanted.

6082 2018-11-13 15:58:34 It’s always interesting how gas prices go up with the price of oil pretty quickly, but when oil drops it takes a while for the price to “trickle through” 
6083 2018-11-13 15:58:31 leaving TV on the TV sounds like a good plan. Like I grew up planted in front of a TV but at least it didn't travel everywhere I went. There was that good era where anything on TV was entertaining enough to watch because it was TV. Sit at the oil change place and watch whatever.
6084 2018-11-13 15:58:25 In 1919, Lloyd George boasted of gaining Mesopotamia, Palestine, German colonies in SA, plus the islands in the pacific, adding that Mesopotamia, now Iraq, had some of the richest oil fields in the world. Sounds a lot like, as with most wars, it was little to do with freedom.

6119 2018-11-13 15:55:34 Just an aside, trade between India and Brazil (imports/exports) is dominated by transactions of Reliance. Reliance gets crude oil from Brazil and exports back refined petroleum products, and still manages to make a profit! They seem to have overcome the tyranny of distance.
6120 2018-11-13 15:55:31 ...And I'll extrapolate further, the early 100 Rally also faded because the continued fall in OIL TODAY as Oil and Gas represent what? 40+% of the S&P 500?? @CVP #AskPayne

6122 2018-11-13 15:55:17 Thinking about this for a few weeks: is EM equities decline in 2018 per a) strengthening oil prices (supply-side)? or b) fears of trade frictions backing up on commodity demand (demand side)? or c) belief that we're due for a global pause / downturn (big business cycle story)?

6142 2018-11-13 15:53:29 Wolfgang now turns attention to Misrata militias. About 18k soldiers. Misrata no longer has consensus on what to do militarily. They focus on Misrata for the moment. They could try to take Tripoli and/or oil crescent, but he sees as risky with many casualties. #ncuslr2018
6143 2018-11-13 15:53:24 @SquawkStreet WE DON'T ship #oil that much anywhere. Can't afford to sell it that cheap to EU and the strong dollar is really killing oil exports.

L=#LNG are LONG term contracts and we're shipping like crazy - BUT NOT #WTI

Kudlow should know better. Obviously faber doesn't.

6145 2018-11-13 15:53:20 You’re right, Court! Products that use palm oil sourced in a non-sustainable way are very destructive and contribute to habitat loss for many animals. That’s why we created the app! We wanted to make it easier for consumers to find products that use sustainable palm oil.

6172 2018-11-13 15:51:22 There’s a lot that needs to be changed. I don’t think we’ll ever get it perfect because something else will come up.
Like the palm oil industry. Very damaging but the demand for the product has to change. Same with our use of wood.

6183 2018-11-13 15:50:51 Of course over producing oil to lower prices has nothing to do with what's his name (Saudi executed journalist in Turkey). Just saying, don't hear about it any more and gas is cheap.

6236 2018-11-13 15:47:21 Oil is sold as a commodity.  Prices are not based on supply and demand.  You would know this if you actually attended classes at your vaunted college.

6242 2018-11-13 15:47:07 I think a lot of the time the people who are saying "palm oil is bad" and only voicing this may not know how they can really make a difference. In a world overloaded with issues, sometimes we need a little guidance to know how to help and change.

6244 2018-11-13 15:46:50 You seem to misunderstand the international oil market although it's quite simple. Scotland would have to nationalise oil industry 1st then spend billions buying equipment to run it as companies leave in large numbers

6251 2018-11-13 15:45:56 #icelandchristmasadvert @IcelandRichard 
FYI @piersmorgan #GMB that 0.4% of land now in palm oil plantation, was once primary rainforest, of which only 3% remains. Orangutans live in a fraction of such RF on Sumatra & Borneo, so 0.4% gone is highly significant in their survival
6252 2018-11-13 15:45:51 Oil mkt a total scam.  i love it!
6253 2018-11-13 15:45:49 Will #palmoil standards body @RSPOtweets ever champion real sustainability? This week its members vote on whether to clamp down on labour abusers like @Indofood who go on selling palm oil marked with its logo #RT16 #RSPO

6261 2018-11-13 15:45:31 yup that's true. so high oil prices have a cascading (negative) effect on India. unlike China
6262 2018-11-13 15:45:26 2/2 It is that a vast amount of people are now more aware of the issues surrounding palm oil than were aware of it before.
6263 2018-11-13 15:45:24 I boiled my short wig and added a bit of olive oil and conditioner. It’s not even dry yet but damn

6265 2018-11-13 15:45:12 The problem is that many of them will just add their voices to the "all palm oil is bad; boycott" chorus that doesn't effect real change. I hope many of those whose awareness has  been raised will see beyond simplistic calls for a boycott & go on to help make a real difference.

El gobierno, como otros de la UE, quiere que a partir de 2050 se dejen de utilizar los vehículos que utilizan estos combustibles.
¿Esta medida también afectará a las calefacciones de gas oil, gas natural, etc...?
6276 2018-11-13 15:44:40 Yes! try it! The best face wash I’ve used. Baking soda & water (paste consistency) or if my face feels dry mix in coconut oil or almond oil

6283 2018-11-13 15:44:04 I look forward to seeing how Norway pays for “green” by drilling more oil wells than ever before. Also, their brilliance of duplicating Alberta’s Heritage Fund. Please ask why Norway embraces their energy sector and why it so important, in this day and age. Can’t wait.......
6284 2018-11-13 15:44:01 Yep. Oil can influence US markets. Then they can influence others and so on. This 350-365 holding, good entries for longs. Bulls pushing again...

My head will not refuse it, for my prayer will still be against the deeds of evildoers.” But what does kind or kindness really mean? @holybibletoday
6286 2018-11-13 15:43:53 US is actually in an #oil squeeze with full tanks, but no pipelines for sale of the oil. Stucked with oil not available.
6287 2018-11-13 15:43:51 It’s great there are people willing to fight for our freedom but this is a girl being kept from her father for years on end under the guise of human rights when it’s all about oil and imperialism with innocent lives on both ends.
6288 2018-11-13 15:43:50 I love how technology shrinks this world we are in so much. In the last few days I’ve had several calls with our olive oil producer as well as other businesses looking to break into the US market via @WhatsApp.

6299 2018-11-13 15:43:15 The tech was British and American. Especially oil tech and industrial facilities. If USSR went with NEP instead of collectivization I argue it would have capital surplus which would be deployed much more efficiently in the 30s. Also Ukranine would never turn to collaboration.
6300 2018-11-13 15:43:06 2006 #SaddamHussein is killed for using alternative payment methods for crude oil to the U.S. Petro dollar. 
In 2011 #MuammarGadaffi is killed for creating a new currency for oil transactions and more.
2018....@realDonaldTrump stops a middle eastern country from using the dollar.
6301 2018-11-13 15:43:05 They also stopped using Fairtrade Cocoa and use palm oil from rain forests.
6302 2018-11-13 15:42:59 Crude oil prices been bleeding for a while.

6305 2018-11-13 15:42:48 i don't think people really understand the connection between fossil fuels and forest fires. I know we keep hammering that point but I really don't think most people get that. When the forest goes up in flames people don't get mad at oil companies.

6307 2018-11-13 15:42:45 But funded by Koch brothers, New York hedge funds and oil interests is fine right? There is always bias - agreed - but the current toxic bias of political groups like CPC funded Ontario Proud and Rebel Media on social media have become alt hate.
6308 2018-11-13 15:42:40 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles!
6309 2018-11-13 15:42:39 Yes, palm oil sucks. But what are you going to be eating instead to replace it? What animals are harmed with that replacement crop? Do those animals matter less because they’re smaller?? Less human like??

6316 2018-11-13 15:42:02 When the anti-fracking movement defends the land and the water peacefully- we understand that we are fighting for the integrity of our country against an invading foreign army.  We are protecting the very soul of this land against a rapacious oil industry. And we won’t stop.
6317 2018-11-13 15:42:01 It's also the only oil grown on tropical areas, so it's the only oil that drives deforestation, so the yield is irrelevant. Calling this a scapegoat shows how little you care about tropical forests and the animals who depend on it for their survival.
6318 2018-11-13 15:42:01 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.

6320 2018-11-13 15:42:01 No offence but im not going to take the word of someone who cant put the correct spelling of know.
I have literally talked to people who work with the oil industry and they in no way believe that. Refilling is either reserve underestimation or achieved by pumping.
6321 2018-11-13 15:42:00 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

6327 2018-11-13 15:41:44 I just blended the top layer of oil into the new jar of peanut butter. So I think I know a thing or two about struggle.
6328 2018-11-13 15:41:44 The last piece on whats happening to global growth.  The demise of Crude Oil. This is going to have a much bigger impact than some realise.  The lack of USD flowing into EM will be getting worse.
6329 2018-11-13 15:41:43 What is the significance here??? Bret oil traded negative then why HPCL n Jet spiked today??? 
6330 2018-11-13 15:41:43 LOL. I received income from the oil industry for years. Hardly defamation. What a joke.
6331 2018-11-13 15:41:28 @Lagostalks913 Pls does d price of oil affect gas price?
6332 2018-11-13 15:41:26 I could just be smug and say that ~ 600 miles of motoring cost me only £18 (EV) - but that would be very short-sighted. As a long-time oil producer, we should have fuel and general motoring taxes at half our present rip-off figures at least. The economy could do so much better.

6367 2018-11-13 15:40:01 Hi there, thanks for getting back to us. Our usage of palm oil is actually very small and most of this is in the form of derivative ingredients manufactured from palm oil that are then used in our products. Palm oil itself is not harmful to the environment. 1/3

6381 2018-11-13 15:38:55 The UK oil money was not squandered.  A decision was made right at the start to use it to benefit people now with generous welfare payments, more public services and lower taxation.  Stop the false information and grievancemongering.  Nobody believes it except cult members

6393 2018-11-13 15:38:05 what?! Let me be clear: it's not fine to derail a necessary debate on palm oil by mentioning that in Brazil beef is the main driver of deforestation. Hell, beef is the major factor of deforestation worldwide but that doesn't mean that palm oil expansion is not a problem.
6394 2018-11-13 15:38:02 Okay but big oil, pharma, and insurance won’t fund candidates that want Medicare for all or climate change reform... you’re reasoning isn’t logical.

6507 2018-11-13 15:30:24 If you're asking why we buy oil from foreign countries (not final products like gasoline), it's because we can't get oil to our existing refineries (~1.6MM bbl/d capacity in Canada). We need a pipeline like Energy East to become self sufficient.

6515 2018-11-13 15:29:47 With anti trust laws being brought up it may mean that our beating the drum about stopping the Kochs is being heard. They have monopolies on oil and coal. January will be an exciting month as the House changes hands.
6516 2018-11-13 15:29:44 Step up oil production in the US. Stop exporting our oil to China!

6545 2018-11-13 15:27:50 I cant remember, are low Oil prices good or bad for the economy?
6546 2018-11-13 15:27:42 I checked my oil when I got there and I have a pure bad feeling i never put the oil cap back on right and that they're gonna think I was driving about like that

6550 2018-11-13 15:27:35 Where did you get your figure of 7million out of job from? Get something clear... the economy is an oil based one and just recently the government is trying to diversify the economy and that is what has differentiated us from Venezuela's economy
6551 2018-11-13 15:27:33 I don't know if CBD oil is legal in the UK, but that might be worth trying! It's totally safe, doesn't have THC in it, and you can get it in vape form or edible form, or pretty much any form.

6553 2018-11-13 15:27:30 We're members of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), a non-profit membership organisation that promotes the growth and use of sustainable palm oil. We purchase 100% of our palm oil from RSPO-certified sources.
6554 2018-11-13 15:27:29 Biggest gainer of oil drop: India. Trifecta--CAD lower, rupee stronger, inflation threat dimmer, and RBI rate cut likely. Plus more money in consumer pockets.
6555 2018-11-13 15:27:28 I used olive oil spray and it didn’t stick at all! They were super yummy.

4) Strict emissions regulations on oil & gas esp. methane

6565 2018-11-13 15:26:32 I'd also mention that the article is a bit misleading on the position of Greenpeace, which doesn't put out the message that "palm oil is really bad". Unlike Iceland, its position is much more nuanced and it calls for responsible production.

6582 2018-11-13 15:25:40 It’s not easy Joanne, as Palm Oil is in so much of what we use,and sometimes coming in under different names - nevertheless -I’m a great believer that we have a moral and spiritual obligation to help all life, starting where we can, however small that gesture may be - it counts.
6583 2018-11-13 15:25:39 $USO
This is where experience may matter:

I remember leveraged wildcatters going BK last time Oil hit the skids.

I also remember the market going after the banks that loaned them money.

I also remember small and micro caps getting hit b/c those same banks didn't want to lend.
6584 2018-11-13 15:25:36 More big news.
 Oil futures for December now well below 60 and 70 dollars a barrel. $57 and $67. Not seen that low in awhile. Large oil surpluses combined with decreased demand as we segue to renewables.

6588 2018-11-13 15:25:01 It is because the shortage of dollar reserves drives up libor and crowds out global private investment because Us  deficits matter again ie they are not being sterilized on net by global CBs. The inflationary demand-destroying effect of higher libor today = higher oil

6612 2018-11-13 15:23:15 England is more prosperous?

6620 2018-11-13 15:22:35 "Lies. Damn Lies and statistics" I suppose. Would be interesting to amalgamate a score from numerous sources to get a general consensus. It just goes to show how difficult it is to avoid unsustainable palm oil.
6621 2018-11-13 15:22:35 That's entirely possible, that they only see the worst of it, but isn't that the point? the NRA doesn't want doctors to speak out because they see the worst of it. People who see the effects of gun violence would be most suited to speak about it, not those who sell the guns.

6671 2018-11-13 15:17:51 Apologies to 90% of my followers outside NL for tweeting in Dutch last few days. Let me explain. In 1958 oil companies hit natural gaz, big, in NL Northern province of Groningen. Big time. Whole of NL connected, lots of exports. Government spent big: salaries, socila security.
6672 2018-11-13 15:17:51 An hour and a half (and counting) for a fucking oil change. 
6673 2018-11-13 15:17:50 Thanks for this @rangtanforest   I’ve been avoiding chocolate with palm oil for a long time, because it’s a cheap way of processing cocoa. Palm oil free chocolate tastes so much better. Didn’t know the devastating effect of palm oil production though. Now I do! So, yes, thanks!
6674 2018-11-13 15:17:42 Not true. Palm oil is much cheaper than other oils. Increased PO supply leads to decreasing prices, which leads to increased demand. We are consuming a lot more vegetable oils since industrial PO arrived, partly in processed products, partly in biofuels.

6680 2018-11-13 15:17:14 My personal hero of 2018 is tea tree oil. 

Thank you for killing all my pimples and making my skin average again.
6681 2018-11-13 15:17:13 I'm not even a super-macro guy. The "oil is crashing" story is being compared to the '14 crash. The two are different. Maybe this time the oil slide is more of a future demand, global slowdown and/or recession theme. Not suggesting that is not the case. Just producers are ok.

6684 2018-11-13 15:16:45 Gold and oil still not happy
6685 2018-11-13 15:16:44 I worked in the oil industry for years, and we would always talk about this. It’s ironic how dumb these smart people are.
6686 2018-11-13 15:16:39 Monday’s selling began in the technology sector, then morphed into a rout that dragged lower everything from oil conglomerates to manufacturers to entertainment...
6687 2018-11-13 15:16:32 .@nancipelosi better fucking start working on the #GreenNewDeal if she wants any respect from progressives. But she won't cause she's most likely backed by Big Oil and Big Coal

6692 2018-11-13 15:16:15 I wouldn’t put bio oil on your face if you have acne prone skin. I did and it didn’t work in my favour 
6693 2018-11-13 15:16:11 Threads are a glorious read , if you are willing to include the fine print of historic reality , but just words , if they don't factor in the midnight oil it took to save a Nation from a Depression .

6697 2018-11-13 15:16:04 We’re in a small town in the mountains of Morocco, at a restaurant, and the group of Chinese women at the table next to us have brought their own jar of (clearly homemade) chilli oil and god I love them so much.
6698 2018-11-13 15:16:02 thanks

IEA might be right as of now; more interesting to me is that everyone's outlooks keep changing in the same direction (more EVs).

But that BNEF oil displaced trend is curious indeed.
6699 2018-11-13 15:15:58 PM has just slapped him with S 400 and Iran oil deal despite their threat.
6700 2018-11-13 15:15:52 Just double checking G&R​ 3Q 2017 letter.They​ studied shale peak oil in basins like Permian, Bakken and Eagle Ford.​Their​​ estimates were:
-Eagle Ford:"As with the Bakken, it is clear that the Eagle Ford peaked at 1.7 mm b/d in 2015." We are now at 1.438mbpd. @HFI_Research
6701 2018-11-13 15:15:47 I have little empathy for the Coal/ Oil industries.
The opportunities to transition to Stable Renewable power was available by 1980 ~ Over 38 yrs ago.
Their Greed has cost Us/Life dearly.
6702 2018-11-13 15:15:40 Let me remind you that, if oil prices crushed, it would bring down everything, including equity prices. You don’t want to see a global asset price meltdown, do you?
6703 2018-11-13 15:15:40 Should oil continue to drop to one dollar?

6707 2018-11-13 15:15:12 A look inside the cutting machine shows how it removes the heads. It's made from sustainable palm oil.

Are you interested in comment on the Iceland palm oil story - the fact that it's total nonsense and that sustainable palm oil is the way forward? Have a piece ready, written by a Bristol corporate sustainability expert

6718 2018-11-13 15:14:45 I noticed that @MikeHudema recently stated that the majority of the Oil Sands is foreign owned...5 years ago, maybe. Not anymore. That's Canadian investments that are being screwed with by land locking our resources. Canadian citizens with retirement investments need these 2 work

6724 2018-11-13 15:14:23 3/ A. Introducing greater stability and predictability in nominal and real yield may reduce coordination and planning costs. B. Countering exogenous economic shocks like a sudden surge in oil shocks may reduce path dependent economic damage.
6725 2018-11-13 15:14:23 That will be gold shortly. Oil usually goes up and gold stays. But when oil comes down, gold catches down with it.
6726 2018-11-13 15:14:19 You know that's not true, a lot of certified Palm Oil is produced on deforested areas and with major human rights abuses. You know that, right?
6727 2018-11-13 15:13:58 ADD OIL!!! 
6728 2018-11-13 15:13:56 Leo Varadkar has just had to clarify his own remarks in the Dáil, after earlier claiming to the FURY of Michael Healy Rae that health supplements were just "snake oil that cost you money." He has now conceded that some, of course,  have *some* benefits. #NotAllSupplements
6729 2018-11-13 15:13:54 Stock market volatility is the focus, but consider the Dollar's strength, oil's price implosion, gold's lack of response, and bonds (i.e. long term interest rates). This period of intra-market realignment and volatility is compounded by the threat of intense Trump investigations.

6734 2018-11-13 15:13:26 Was it for presenting as something it wasn't? I'd thought it was because ads with political points (as this clearly had re palm oil) are just no-nos
6735 2018-11-13 15:13:25 Crude oil is down 12 consecutive market days. It is now the longest losing streak ever. U.S. oil is below $59.00 & international Brent is below $69.00.
6736 2018-11-13 15:13:19 My goodness, Crude Oil getting whacked again. If it doesnt hold 55-56, things could get scary!
6737 2018-11-13 15:13:17 しよう！？(違う話だったらごめんなさい)
6738 2018-11-13 15:13:11 I am doing a sadness. I also check the ingredients for palm oil when I'm shopping because that's a big NO 4 me.
6739 2018-11-13 15:13:11 Nb premier will likely do this too. He worked for Irving Oil prior to becoming a politician. Dont worry nb will do whats necessary again as will the other provinces.
6740 2018-11-13 15:13:10 bring back palm oil, that's what I say
6741 2018-11-13 15:13:09 BP shares down to 509p as oil slumps another 3% to below $58 a barrel.

6743 2018-11-13 15:13:05 So what's so great about palm oil then, why is every product using it when sunflower and vegetable oils are just as good x
6744 2018-11-13 15:12:59 Basically our consumerist ideology needs to stop - there’s no point boycotting palm oil and then buying all the same products if they use soybean oil for example- this is just as bad if not worse. (Palm oil has just had a lot of coverage because it’s the most widely farmed crop)

6760 2018-11-13 15:11:53 I love frying carrots in very little oil, very very little, stip then thing and strip chilli and paper.

6761 2018-11-13 15:11:49 Oil down 3.5% below $58 - lowest since December 2017.
6762 2018-11-13 15:11:48 @_LandScapemag Hi. The walnut shortbread I made using the recipe in your September magazine came out like pastry below a 5mm pond of oil. Something very wrong with the quantities? Terrible waste of ingredients (x2) & money (I'm a student). Afternoon with family & friends ruined.
6763 2018-11-13 15:11:45 Let's pull out of the middle east& Europe.   We can buy oil from Russia. Let them take over Europe and the middle east.  It would save us a lot of money and a lot of manpower.  They can go back to being mad at Russia and China and not able to do anything about it.
6764 2018-11-13 15:11:42 Oil is going down to $55 possibly even lower. Super ouch any bulls still out there. You must be getting massacred.  $UWT $DWT $OIL $USO
6765 2018-11-13 15:11:41 Crude Oil is down for a record 11 (or 12?) consecutive sessions in a row. Today alone is down 3.6%. Panic selling making an emotional short-term bottom? $CL_F #Oil #crude

6768 2018-11-13 15:11:17 One of the ways of plundering pensioners in #Russia is the annual flow of smuggling of oil products to Germany for more than $2bill, without let or hindrance carried out by corrupt officials ofthe #German MinistryofTransport with the tacit consent of the #Putin
6769 2018-11-13 15:11:15 For now, falling oil prices have muted them. Looking ahead, we hope that people realize that not all that sounds good is better, and that populist statements are made in the self-interests of those uttering them, not necessarily for the welfare the public.

6786 2018-11-13 15:09:54 Yes, they are very different - the price message is far less important than the palm oil message. So the latter deserves greater publicity and should be highlighted by any responsible business when advertising.

6795 2018-11-13 15:08:51 I tried this yesterday and I will say they are good but the caveat is that if you press the sandwich together to bite it, the middle squeezes out due to the oil/grease on the egg and sausage. I had to use a fork for the majority of it.

6798 2018-11-13 15:08:42 Do you realize the environmental costs associated with fossil fuels? Oil prices should be much higher based on that fact alone.

6802 2018-11-13 15:08:15 Really? Wow. I figured it wouldn't happen until after Trump let oil get above $80 a barrel & crash the economy thereby, circa next spring-ish at current rates. Interesting.

6819 2018-11-13 15:06:23 Agree!!.. largely being ignored as a “red flag”.. strong oil market usually reflects strong economy.. the way it’s collapsed along with equity selloff is worrisome signs
6820 2018-11-13 15:06:22 OIL 1H whipsaw/chop precedes this latest dive lower. 58.26 supt fails. I'm looking for news to see what is triggering volatility here. I'll also find next support lower. SCO for now ?
6821 2018-11-13 15:06:22 I literally hate getting tires changed, oil changes & pumping damn gas. 
6822 2018-11-13 15:06:16 Correlation didn't imply causation. Sterlite copper has only 10% impact on Vedanta's topline. Vedanta as such won't be able impact the currency rates as metal exports are very less for the country. The currency fluctuation is because oil and electronics import
6823 2018-11-13 15:06:06 Commodities are entirely different to equities and FX. If a commodity has fallen "too much" it doesn't mean it will recover at some point. They often get annihilated. Look at agricultural commodities, Oil in 2014 and Natgas from 13 to 1.6 !!!  The same is also true for up trends.
6824 2018-11-13 15:06:03 Yea and all it took was destruction of Florida coast and making Oklahoma earthquake county.
Oh and the incoming democrats are shutting down the pipeline going through Lake Superior under Mackinac bridge. Keystone not being built. Oil is dying. Plus how many years til we run out
6825 2018-11-13 15:05:56 India is continuing to be deprived off its ability to come out of import dependency in Oil & gas , Iron Ore, Steel , Cement and other such commodities, which ends up weakening INR! Beware of BreakingIndia forces!

6833 2018-11-13 15:05:16 Best way for dems to go after oil companies is to not purchase their products. Until then, quite hypocritical eh?

6884 2018-11-13 15:01:16 Just going off my personal experience,  the oil doesn't help that much RIGHT after a thing like this, but the higher the THC in however she may choose to dose ( indica ) I prefer smoking 3 times a day due to quicker delivery & faster relief, but you're right
6885 2018-11-13 15:01:15 Hi Ian, all palm oil used in our own-label food products has come from sustainable RSPO-certified sources since 2015. This position is being extended to non-food products by the end of 2018. Thanks.

6904 2018-11-13 14:59:56 But we both know that saying shampoos (elsewhere specified to be ‘Unilever’ shampoos) are ruining the world because of using palm oil, is very different to a price message.
6905 2018-11-13 14:59:56 My worry is that oil consumption overall will not peak. Shipping is a nightmare. Cruise ships.....
6906 2018-11-13 14:59:55 U.S. likely putting major pressure (leverage) on Saudi's and OPEC to squash oil prices over Khashoggi killing.
6907 2018-11-13 14:59:46 Looks like the made Saddam one of the monsters. But Saddam isn’t the only one that invaded a country for its oil.
6908 2018-11-13 14:59:40 by removing palm oil isn't a long term solution and current substitutes 'may' have a larger deforestation impact. Sustainable palm oil may be the answer now.
6909 2018-11-13 14:59:32 Don’t you wish that was the reason. It’s from your trade war with China, the fall in oil prices & the looming inflation from your tax cuts to the wealthy. Most of the country is happy to have a system of checks & balances when you make stupid choices like Matt Whitaker for AAG
6910 2018-11-13 14:59:19 On the plus side, avoiding palm oil provides a healthier diet, as it's in junky heavily processed foods like cheap chocolate, shelf-stable bread, chips, ice cream, etc. If you buy your bread or sweets from a real bakery rather than a factory you're eating better food: bonus.
6911 2018-11-13 14:59:17 Natural Gas has essentially moved from 3 to 4 bucks in a short period of time   Many of the major oil firms pump out a ton of NG, that should help lower the hurt from a collapsing oil price.   However NG normally falls back to the lower 3 range most times after a run up

6914 2018-11-13 14:59:02 Yes. Harold Wilson's "Old Labour*" Government colluded in the use of mass starvation as a weapon of war in Biafra. Oil you see.

6915 2018-11-13 14:59:01 you prolly can't do it right now, but in the future, you can get an essential oil or scented lotion in a scent that doesn't bother you & put it underneath your nose--kinda like those febreezes that just cover the scent of whatever's there but really local??
6916 2018-11-13 14:58:46 Both my young sons who love a certain chocolate and hazelnut spread containing palm oil told me yesterday they will not eat it anymore, which is good because I am not buying it anymore. Shocked at how many items we eat containing palm oil! #lifechange

6918 2018-11-13 14:58:39 It's great that so many more people are now thinking about palm oil, but this will only make a real difference if companies are pressured to clean up their supply chains and end deforestation for oil palms. Boycotts like Iceland's don't effect real change on the ground.

6927 2018-11-13 14:57:12 Imagine OPEC doing to the West now what it did in the 70's. OPEC's basically dead.

The West has destroyed the power bloc that controlled the world's access to cheap oil - which was also one of America's main global opponents.

Those who work for American hegemony are pleased.

6956 2018-11-13 14:54:35 We're sorry to hear that Jen - we can confirm that we use RSPO certified sustainable palm oil in our snacks.

6962 2018-11-13 14:53:48 Hi Rob, as a responsible retailer we have met our commitment to exclusively use certified sustainable palm oil for all of our food products. All palm oil used in our own-label food products has come from sustainable RSPO-certified sources since 2015. Thanks.
6963 2018-11-13 14:53:39 Data is the oil of the 21st century, and analytics is the combustion engine !
6964 2018-11-13 14:53:25 Bloody brilliant .......
Thank you xx
6965 2018-11-13 14:53:22 Really! So why have your parent company took oil from companies that have destroyed 25,000 hectares of land belonging to critically endangered Orang-utans in Indonesia!? Not to mention 70,000 hectares in last two years overall!?
6966 2018-11-13 14:53:22 Si l'on découvre ailleurs qu'en Amérique des gisements de schiste, l'horizon 2025 ne semble pas un mur. Pour l'instant, aux cours actuels, ce n'est pas rentable, mais cela ne veut pas dire qu'il n'y a rien. Et on ne sait pas au juste ce qu'il y a en Arabie Saoudite
6967 2018-11-13 14:53:19 Scientists predict a 'dark matter hurricane' will collide with the Earth: IT ALREADY HAS ! ITS PHUK'N REPUBLICUNT CORP "KOCH"-SUKKAS "OIL HURRY-CANE" DESTROYIN' THE ONLY INHABITABLE PLANET THAT OUR LORD GOD ALMIGHTY GAVE TO MANKIND !!!
6968 2018-11-13 14:53:19 My only question is what is driving this? The BOJ is not in the market so one cannot say it is non-market forces. I believe we are flush with USD and lower demand. Oil is our largest import and its price is falling. Persons also aren’t fleeing JMD as they once were.
6969 2018-11-13 14:53:18 The #orangutans could be extinct within a generation >> destructive #palmoil companies like @Indofood are to blame. RT to tell members of palm oil certification org @RSPOtweets to commit to ‘No #Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ #RT16 #RSPO
6970 2018-11-13 14:53:02 and in terms of EU ag policy, it seems plausible to me that a good palm oil policy would be to intensify european olive oil production. Driving the cost of olive oil down and the production up, thereby making palm oil less profitable.
6971 2018-11-13 14:52:57 .... Asia accounts for largest human soy consumption, as traditional food source, not as plant based fad. Soya oil is 1 of the most widely consumed veg oils + for printing ink. Therefore veggie/vegan reference is inaccurate & almost irrelevant if you do the full maths.
6972 2018-11-13 14:52:54 from one man’s daughter to the next. ladies: 

1. go get your oil changed.
2. let your car warm up in the mornings when it’s cold, don’t just drive off.
6973 2018-11-13 14:52:49 oil is gonna bounce/explode at some point before the years end. : ]

6975 2018-11-13 14:52:42  I was just thinking about my twin boys (14).  One will not put on an article of clothing until he is sufficiently slathered in coconut oil from head to toe.  The other is on task to become The ashiest, crustiest young man in the world.

6978 2018-11-13 14:52:19 I'm not saying Buhari is a saint, but I wonder why the billions he stole didn't go to offshore bank accounts like others...still can't comprehend why he doesn't have houses abroad like others, no house in Ikoyi or Banana Island n Lagos. No oil well in his name or trace to family.

6985 2018-11-13 14:51:40 I did some research on armor lately. Medieval armor was ripe with strange accessories. One such gadget was a built-in oil lantern for guardsmen (inset into chest piece). It was rare (and not very practical) but just in case you need to kill a guard in a spectacular, fiery way.
6986 2018-11-13 14:51:37 First we see prices of goods go up due to your silly Tariffs, now YOUR buddies the Murderous Saudis are jacking our oil prices, after convincing you to leave Iran Nuclear Deal and ban Irianian oil. Wow, “Mr Art if the Deal” you’re really screwing us.

6989 2018-11-13 14:51:16 That’s it... any @MDLZ brand including @CadburyUK is now off my shopping list. Dirty palm oil killing off endangered Orangutans for fucking chocolate and biscuits. Time to support ethical brands.
6990 2018-11-13 14:50:48 Listen to OB's last SOU speech.  Coal Bad! Fossil Fuels Bad! Gas and Oil Important!  All in same paragraph. Yes these people are stupid.
6991 2018-11-13 14:50:37 A sad claim from one who knows & sold his soul to the party.
Subsidized prices by borrowing.
PKR kept constant against $  
Electricity & Gas prices low (circular debt) 
Cheap imports
International oil prices had hit bottom. 
Very Sad Mr. Ismail.

6996 2018-11-13 14:49:44 Surprised? 
remember when Democrats went after oil for environmental reasons, Republicans went after all  because they linked it to terrorism, and those in the middle went after oil because it supported undemocratic regimes? I will post the article on this once I find it.
6997 2018-11-13 14:49:29 @PotNoodle Will you be considering changing your ingredients to eliminate the palm oil?  I was very disappointed to see it listed among the ingredients.

7002 2018-11-13 14:48:46 It’s not only copper....it’s also due to not producing our own oil & gas inspite of having our own reserves.... it’s also due to not mining iron ore inspite of our own reserves....breakingindia forces have clear design of pushing us towards imports rather than make in India!!!

7016 2018-11-13 14:47:31 The Lightlife Deli “meats” make yummy grilled samwiches. Add some fresh kale salad to your lunch by massaging a splash of sesame oil, Bragg’s, Nooch and sesame seeds into 3-4 leaves of destemmed kale. Also Meijer has Sweet Earth Foods products now in the same case.
7017 2018-11-13 14:47:30 I don’t mind it as long as it’s relevant to what the artist is doing. I’ve seen art youtubers trying to promote or review art products companies sent them, but the stuff is not at all what the artist itself usually use. (Digital artist promoting oil paints etc)
7018 2018-11-13 14:47:27 The “confidential” deal between #Baghdad and #Erbil in #Kirkuk oil should be shared with Council of Representatives first.

7022 2018-11-13 14:47:02 @Dieter_Helm Could adoption of electric vehicles cause the price of oil to go up since the oil will likely be used for higher value products such as jet fuel, pharmaceuticals, and polymers.

7048 2018-11-13 14:44:22 The advert does say something about Iceland - that they are in the process of removing the use of palm oil from their own-brand products. I have seen ads that 'denigrate' competitors in terms of product price, so why not on the use of environmentally damaging palm oil?
7049 2018-11-13 14:44:20 Avoid a fan oven if you can. Otherwise, sit the bird on a wire rack over a little liquid as the steam will keep it tender and help the skin crisp. But you do need some butter or oil over the breast.

7072 2018-11-13 14:42:16 #crude Oil prices fell over 1% with benchmark Brent crude slipping below the $70 mark after Donald Trump’s pressure on OPEC on not to cut supply. Taking the cues, all the OMCs and aviation stocks made a strong rally.

7080 2018-11-13 14:41:16 Be Bold, Be Ambitious, Be Creative... and while you're at it there are some pretty big oil spills that are still killing plants, animals and humans. Maybe you could use some of your bold, ambitious creativity to make this planet better? Just a thought.
7081 2018-11-13 14:41:10 If they had simply concluded, as experts and NGOs have, that demanding deforestation-free certified sustainable palm oil is the solution to the problems portrayed in the film, then it would have been an excellent tool for raising awareness.
7082 2018-11-13 14:41:07 Just found out that Oreo's are made with palm oil

7085 2018-11-13 14:40:58 I remember when Harley Davidson cried to the government to tariff Japanese bikes because they were cheaper and didn’t leak engine oil everywhere. So if France isn’t letting in so much of our wine into their country , that’s up to them , not @realDonaldTrump !

7087 2018-11-13 14:40:40 As it’s revealed Cadbury are pushing them to extinction in pursuit of palm oil, wildlife experts say the only hope for orangutans now is learning to play the drums.

7094 2018-11-13 14:40:07 I know US fndns provide funds to some Canadian enviro orgs. The same US fndns  also fund US enviro orgs. Is their funding of Canadian enviros disproportionate? If not, I think the "US fndns are about shutting out Canadian oil" hypothesis fails. We need data 2b convinced.
7095 2018-11-13 14:39:55 Best thing I’ve ever done for my face is start using rosehip oil 
7096 2018-11-13 14:39:49 They do have palm oil in them, James. We only use RSPO certified sources of palm oil and our Food Team is working hard to reduce our use of this and we hope this helps to reassure you.

7099 2018-11-13 14:39:28 Started to watch couldn't see it through - too much snake oil obscuring the screen
7100 2018-11-13 14:39:24 Johnny @SirJohnSteele can OIL go to $0 like a stock?
7101 2018-11-13 14:39:18 Currently we are not able to produce some of our variants without palm oil, as it has certain properties not found in other plant-based oils. We only use it where we absolutely have to and are member of Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil. We are very aware of our responsibility.
7102 2018-11-13 14:39:14 No oil...
7103 2018-11-13 14:39:13 Do you believe the figures that @NNPCgroup chun out to us as our oil revenues on yearly basis?  I will not be surprise if indeed we made more than $100b annually. Shine your eyes.

7105 2018-11-13 14:39:03 Friendly reminder that Cadbury’s use palm oil but Lindt only use 100% sustainable palm oil in their chocolate  think of the orang utans in Xmas chocolate season 
7106 2018-11-13 14:38:59 Yes, it is already happening but not enough. To incentivise growers to become sustainable, we must commit to sourcing sustainable palm oil. Otherwise, we face a business-as-usual scenario for most of the industry, resulting in huge losses of biodiversity & increase deforestation.

7110 2018-11-13 14:38:54 But the point is forests are still being cut down for sustainable palm oil. You and others misinform people about this

7112 2018-11-13 14:38:51 I have one question. What should we petroleum engineers should do if no vacancies are created by oil and gas companies for us and rather they hire engineers with other disciplines for drilling or production about which they have no idea and what we have been studying for long4yrs
7113 2018-11-13 14:38:26 うちも待ってたら帰ってくるからいいもんねーーーーーｗｗｗｗｗ
7114 2018-11-13 14:38:25 currently getting my oil changed and they aint try to make me get anything else  AND a bih got 50% off aint even needa call my daddy lmfao
7115 2018-11-13 14:38:13 I have similar concerns with increased woody/solid fuel use in place of oil or gas for residential heating, but with respect to PM pollution. Especially in traditional stoves that have no real pollution control. That can be/often is a direct health hazard for children & elderly.

7120 2018-11-13 14:37:40 Too much oil
7121 2018-11-13 14:37:40 You make some valid points, thank you. However, the message Iceland was trying to get across is still valid, how many people do you think this has now got thinking about palm oil and where it comes from, probably hundred of thousands who may not have considered or cared before.
7122 2018-11-13 14:37:31 Dear Rover, try and convince the Nasa people to have a live feed on the day of the event. So, you get new batteries, eh? And, ugh, oil and stuff...
7123 2018-11-13 14:37:28 OPEC manipulates oil supply in an unfree & unfair market. It is time to pass NOPEC to put real pressure on the cartel, which does not serve US consumer interests. #NOPEC #OPEC
7124 2018-11-13 14:37:26 oil spilled.................
7125 2018-11-13 14:37:22 I am expecting a reversal in #oil #WTI #crude today, the #DSI is extremely low, I believe today is the 12 th day negative trading day, of course I may be wrong but taking a chance here $USO ; expecting a move towards 60.16/26 in #WTI
7126 2018-11-13 14:37:18 Their own brands, but not other brands though, so they are still selling palm oil to give shoppers a choice. If Iceland were not hypocrites, there wouldn't be a choice.

7132 2018-11-13 14:36:51 there are reports that petrol prices will increase by 10 or something. I hope that doesnt happen warna loag kya karein ge. This is mostly because of the rupee devaluation because oil prices have decreased by 10-15 dollars in the international market.
7133 2018-11-13 14:36:46 Prison lobby, gun lobby, tobacco lobby, oil lobby ... what are you talking about? There's tons of jobs out there for her.

7135 2018-11-13 14:36:28 Ok fine. NDA reduced taxes by 1.5₹/l and an another ₹1/l by reducing oil refiners margin. What was the result? In 10 days the price of oil again climbed upto to earlier prices. So still according to you, is reducing taxes a solution? Then don't demand roads,bridges n metro rail
7136 2018-11-13 14:36:23 @narendramodi  Dear Sir, why Oil and Gas companies dont hire petroleum engineers and instead hire engineers with other disciplines who have no idea about this field. What should we petroleum engineers do if our core companies refuse to hire us??
7137 2018-11-13 14:36:23 your car  it’s an oil filter
7138 2018-11-13 14:36:20 Palm oil is bad for the environment and the people who harvest it (way unethical labor practices) but it’s been bad for years, people suddenly care?
7139 2018-11-13 14:36:11 @IcelandRichard and his media relations team have done a brilliant job of raising awareness, reaching far more people than Greenpeace alone could have. People who never gave palm oil a thought are now checking packages before they buy.
7140 2018-11-13 14:36:02 @RaoulGMI @ttmygh Oil in free fall may be the canary in the coal mine.

7145 2018-11-13 14:35:41 "Furthermore, palm oil is an important crop for the GDP  of emerging economies and there are millions of smallholder farmers who  depend on producing palm oil for their livelihood. Boycotting palm oil is not always the answer,"

2. Switzerland have a unique geographical position, if you look on a map. Also they're incredibly rich.
Norway is the other one you clowns reference without ever realising that they have most of the oil in Europe but 10% our population
7153 2018-11-13 14:35:01 olive oil in particular is interesting. If you own an arid mountainside where nothing except olives will grow,  you probably only plant the area that your family farm has the labour to crop. So maybe land-use isn't all that important. Across Europe, the intensity varies a lot.

7158 2018-11-13 14:34:36 we have to make some changes before we can bring that up. Otherwise those phrases/topics will create a screaming match. Oil companies have gotten religious idiots to dig their heals in. So we are up against a lot of layers of bull. This will change after the lame duck session

7198 2018-11-13 14:31:11 @PGUK What is your policy on using sustainable palm oil? I read that you were one of the worst offenders when it comes to this issue. Not saying that is true just curious as to what initiatives you have in play and some hard numbers?

7211 2018-11-13 14:30:17 I know that no other crop produces as much oil per acre planted, so in theory if planted and grown correctly without any damage to the environment, it is the best and most viable option, but is this going to be possible?

7218 2018-11-13 14:29:53 People getting all earth conscious with that Iceland advert, gonna guess 98% of them will still buy Palm oil based products. 
7219 2018-11-13 14:29:50 It makes a lot more sense to make laws that prohibit the use of crude oil on International waters than to softly force people to buy a billion cars. Do yóu work for ford?

7224 2018-11-13 14:29:31 Could be a contributing factor, but, were that hypothesis true, we would not have seen the same behaviour before the discovery of oil right? This has been going on for many centuries. Western influence may have magnified it, but is not causal.

7230 2018-11-13 14:28:41 Considering it so clearly reads Iceland are removing all palm oil from their own branded products, there is nothing hypocritical about it

7234 2018-11-13 14:28:32 When ordering things such as omelettes at a restaurant, asking them to prepare it with cooking spray only can save 200+ calories by simply holding the oil. #fitness #HealthyEating

7238 2018-11-13 14:27:46 People protest pipelines in the name of environmentalism, so we move oil on trains. They oppose cutting any trees, so the forest burns down. Will common sense ever prevail or are we destined to poison ourselves with with own stupidity?
7239 2018-11-13 14:27:41 I worked for an oil company in engineering. The only innovations I saw were reactionary to new environmental regulations or as a result of an environmental disaster. Engineers are just a small cog in the large corporation, they do what they’re told and don’t have much say.

7243 2018-11-13 14:27:09 Given enough oil and defense subsidies, as well as private debt and a small enough population, and a people who don’t mind being stolen from, yea it works out great.
7244 2018-11-13 14:27:09 So are you suggesting Iceland should not have cut out palm oil? What would you suggest is a viable move forward to ensure no one is receiving any negative impact from palm oil production and how your trust is helping with this? Genuine question :)
7245 2018-11-13 14:27:09 oh no....Antonio....
7246 2018-11-13 14:27:05 It's absolutely possible with the funding they can use and their drive.  EVs are somewhat "proven" but also the dealership model relies so much on engine repairs.  One Passat we had had an engine oil leak $3300 to fix.  leaked right onto the exhaust pipe too :)

7249 2018-11-13 14:26:54 Hey @LushLtd, I heard you are reformulating your products to avoid palm oil Would you be able to share a list of your palm oil free cosmetics?
7250 2018-11-13 14:26:51 I put on baby oil gel TWICE. Soon as I hit that Cali air, I was ashy all over again.

7253 2018-11-13 14:26:28 Yeah I played some FFA on icebreak and I just camped near the oil tanks and  it was free headshots, took me almost a week for augur headshots and less than an hour for gold

7257 2018-11-13 14:25:59 This statement tells me that Trump has made a deal with Saudi Arabia if they keep oil production high he will bury the Kashoggi Murder with no real consequences to Saudi Arabia. Again Trump selling out our people for money again.
7258 2018-11-13 14:25:51 Oh I don't know but thanks.. bit of lippy works wonders
7259 2018-11-13 14:25:38 Hi, we're committed to using only the most sustainable sources of palm oil in our products. We have removed it wherever possible and 100% of the palm oil used in M&S products is RSPO certified.
7260 2018-11-13 14:25:27 Why are a lot of these different to the scores give by the wwf palm oil scorecard? Some dramatically so.

7283 2018-11-13 14:23:19 This sounds like farms are undergoing the same aggregation and vertical integration oil went through in the time of John D Rockefeller. (oil producers used to have to contract transport out to rail or pipelines, then Rocky bought those, BKed the producers, bought them...etc)
7284 2018-11-13 14:23:19 Absolutely Hill does.  Chia is full in charge of the Oil Kings.  Look it up bud.

7295 2018-11-13 14:21:52 You mean like the new planes,the new ships the new oil pipelines and almost any other project the government has anything to do with?sorry forgot the pot fiasco.
7296 2018-11-13 14:21:51 Mr. President, you are HURTING America if you drive oil prices down too much.  The core of our energy independence is the oil and gas industry.  We have made tremendous strides as of late BUT cannot continue to do so with low commodity prices.   PLEASE RECONSIDER
7297 2018-11-13 14:21:47 Fracking is for both oil & gas. The gas is shale gas not natural gas; extracting it from the rocks is a very dirty process involving injecting millions of gallons of water mixed with toxic chemicals to fracture the rock. It is burning a fossil fuel which adds to climate change
7298 2018-11-13 14:21:45 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President : with changing regime in Venezuela u can have 4 to 5 million of oil barrels a day u can keep oil prices between -40-50 us$ and your reelection is a done deal .US economy booming. SOS  Venezuela SOS

7315 2018-11-13 14:20:10 I like storms and rain. Also I haven't seen rain for quite a while here. Germany is still in a severe drought that is impacting on shipping oil to oil refineries. Means in some places you can't get car fuel anymore...

7349 2018-11-13 14:17:47 If supermarkets stopped buying products with palm oil,then people wouldn’t buy it. More adverts,more videos to make people weary what its doing. #nopalmoil #savetherainforest
7350 2018-11-13 14:17:46 Let me quickly remind you that crude oil has been discovered in most part of the north. i.e; Niger state, lake chad etc
7351 2018-11-13 14:17:39 Palm oil certification body @RSPOtweets will only be credible if its #palmoil growers like @Indofood eradicate exploitation, deforestation & destruction of ecologically precious peatland from plantations. They must use this weeks’ P&C vote well! #RT16 #RSPO
7352 2018-11-13 14:17:38 Have you tried full spectrum CBD oil? Will pray for you.
7353 2018-11-13 14:17:35 Not only that, is the sole cause of Oragutangs dying the palm oil industry? As someone living in Brazil, I see a wide variety of issues that contribute to the deaths of animals in risk of extinction.

7355 2018-11-13 14:16:55 En 2040 no habrá coches diesel ni gasolina ni híbridos,  sólo habrá coches eléctricos alimentados con electricidad generada quemando fuel oil y produciendo residuos radiactivos.
7356 2018-11-13 14:16:48 Here is a fact for you Ian. Our export revenue will stay in Scotland to be used for pur benefit. That's just for starters. We would charge for the excess  electricity we currently pay to upload onto the grid & give to  UK, free of charge. And don't forget oil revenue

7361 2018-11-13 14:16:23 How was your oil?
7362 2018-11-13 14:16:18 Put *really simply*, the distinction becomes quite clear when you consider two potential approaches: a) Palm Oil is evil, killing orangutans and destroying forest. BTW - shampoo companies are evil, b) We're removed Palm Oil for all our products because we believe it's right to.
7363 2018-11-13 14:16:18 I prefer adding little oil to it than butter

7373 2018-11-13 14:15:27 Now, one thing can be bad put in this video: Are all palm oil companies immoral, willing to create deforestation for their business? This ad can be harmful for stereotyping all palm oil businesses into this quadrant...

7384 2018-11-13 14:14:28 The tarsands campaign does nothing to reduce global oil use/ it only shifted the purchase dollars from the west to the mideast. No less oil is being exported from Texas. No less oil is being exported by Saudi Arabia, Russia or non-opec nations. So what was the real agenda.

7498 2018-11-13 14:04:04 The world is at a fascinating time.  Energy options proliferate though things take time.  Combustion must decrease to mitigate climate change risk.   Gas, nuclear, geothermal, renewables, strive to do what they can to help displace oil and coal combustion. As it should be.

7500 2018-11-13 14:04:02 1914 was the year the wealth of the British Empire peaked. The US supplanted us after that with the shift from coal to oil power. I make no judgement about how UK wealth was earned, just that we traded with the whole world then, as we should and want to be FREE to do again.

7505 2018-11-13 14:03:45 It sure was. Had to change the oil 5 times as the motor was full of water. 
Inside was covered in mud and clay.
Only think wrong was I burned out an O2 sensor. 

Was a nightmare for a brand new truck though
7506 2018-11-13 14:03:41 Moronic view in my opinion. Oklahoma would love to have new industry. I would. And it is so much better than the types of industry it could be. Slaughterhouse, oil refinery, nuclear power plant, etc. All high paying jobs though by the way.

It says oil output can be sustained for 20 yrs 

Great stuff

So at current output its generating 1.4bn a year at current prices 

Apply 100% of that oil tax revenue to Scotland you have a 14.7bn deficit a YEAR

7616 2018-11-13 13:51:59 Abu Dhabi could become a net exporter of natural gas after Eni  sealed a deal with the Middle Eastern emirate to develop major natural gas fields. It expects to achieve daily production of 1.5B cubic feet of gas and 150K of oil at an offshore block.
7617 2018-11-13 13:51:50 8.5-9 quarts of synthetic oil. Only good thing is I only have to get it changed every 8,000 miles
7618 2018-11-13 13:51:45 So you guys in Austria get the oil via rivers I suppose! How are the water levels in Tirol?

7622 2018-11-13 13:51:25 actually you will find that many in Europe and all across the world have anger towards the US. America has done nothing but wage war in the middle east and for what? you say you were defending your country against terrorism but really you were after oil.

7624 2018-11-13 13:51:16 ALL players of any size in petro-dollars or petro-economies can exert influence, it seems the problem is now that Iran has tasted that money, they desire to keep it flowing for good reasons. Oil will always find a buyer, price may suffer but even ISIS had no problems selling oil.
7625 2018-11-13 13:51:13 Spread the petals on a flat surface for them to dry out completely for about 2-3 days. Once dried, you can either use only the roses or add some more fragrances by adding dried rosemary, lavender or orange peels. 

Add rose or lavender oil and mix well.
7626 2018-11-13 13:51:12 Read the news you fool. OPEC is cutting oil production right now at this moment!

7630 2018-11-13 13:50:53 Ask your mechanic for a bottle of used black engine oil, pour it under the car and spill it by the inferior part of the engine, call the police, wait.
7631 2018-11-13 13:50:53 Would probably agree with the analyst if not for a couple other factors. Tariffs look to weigh heavy during the holiday. Oil prices have been falling. Expect a 4th quarter gdp cool off. And a wicked 1st 2019. I’d get out of risky stock.
7632 2018-11-13 13:50:48 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
7633 2018-11-13 13:50:42 As an NGO dedicated to the survival of the orangutan, we reserve the right to find the misguided decision of @IcelandFoods to boycott palm oil and misinform customers regrettable.
7634 2018-11-13 13:50:39 Yoo yours is clean as hell! The vogues give it a extra pop.. And that's the plan. My guy work at ford is going to put it on a lift to see where the oil is leaking from. The plan is to put some money into it because she runs good and for 25 years the body not that bad
7635 2018-11-13 13:50:36 Tomorrow i get to do the fun part of preparing for trips. Picking up my cannabis order  2 g of oil and an oz of bud.

7637 2018-11-13 13:50:11 It’s essential oil
7638 2018-11-13 13:50:06 If we went green and our machines needed oil, we can just produce it our selves. SA is just cheaper
7639 2018-11-13 13:50:05 All the more reason to minimize our need for oil.  I’m certainly not a terrorist, but I wouldn’t mind watching the kingdom slide into insignificance.

7655 2018-11-13 13:48:41 $EURUSD pair, main compoment of $ index, is a pretty good arbiter these days. Refuge has been in $ vs that curency. It was a precursor to the crude oil debacle and equities to a certain extent. Trying to bounce this morning.
7656 2018-11-13 13:48:39 What about the $3.3billion the Canadian government gives out each year to oil companies.  That's OUR TAX MONEY!  Fuck the big oil companies and their stooges playing the victims.  Such utter crap!

7660 2018-11-13 13:48:15 You were aware of low oil prices. 
You were aware of NDA bombings to reduce oil output.
You were aware of PDP depleting the federation account despite record high oil prices. 
You still blame Buhari for a recession that affected all oil producing Nations worldwide.

7663 2018-11-13 13:47:48 Took the Charger in for its first oil change (and to just get it looked over, since I didn't do that when I bought it) since I bought it in September. It's the little milestones.
7664 2018-11-13 13:47:48 Every time I watch the Greenpeace/Iceland advert it makes me cry. I'm trying so hard to be more sustainable and consume less products with palm oil (or non sustainable palm oil) in

7666 2018-11-13 13:47:44 I would recommend CBD oil but no experience of endometriosis personally.  As a painkiller CBD is great....  Hope your lovely other half finds relief.  Sending bestest wishes 
7667 2018-11-13 13:47:27 Shocking.... Saudi and OPEC won't play ball with Trump's overtures to increase oil production and suddenly we back off the highly sensitive topic of Khashoggi

7669 2018-11-13 13:47:19 Why do you use palm oil in your products knowing the damage this causes?
7670 2018-11-13 13:46:58 No they already announced a few months ago that they were removing palm oil from their own brand range (but not branded products in the shop), claiming they could not find 500 tons of deforestation-free palm oil. And that they were going to ask others to do the same.
7671 2018-11-13 13:46:54 Even if fracking wasn’t banned in Scotland, it will never be economic. If they couldn’t make it work in deregulated Poland at peak oil price with a much broader source rock and the entire continental European rig market, then it won’t work in Scotland.

7678 2018-11-13 13:46:35 America prefers to FIGHT WARS for OIL and POPPY-FIELDS instead of CANCER and HEART DISEASE. Go figure.
7679 2018-11-13 13:46:22 Hopes for a reversal in oil continue to be frustrated after yesterday’s bounce proved short-lived. A barrel of West Texas Intermediate for December delivery traded at $58.50 by 5:45 am EST with crude now headed for its 12th consecutive losing session, the longest on record.
7680 2018-11-13 13:46:19 @BeckyQuick Actually oil is higher than the 4:00 or 4:15 market prices even though lower than the 2:30 pm oil market official close

7690 2018-11-13 13:45:23 So soy is produced to make oil. But the 'meal' which is a by product of the refining process is sold as animal feed and is actually worth more than the oil? So to twist it. Oil can't be the by-product of creating 'meal'... But corn is the primary feed anyway?
7691 2018-11-13 13:45:08 I’ve evicted the spider and a wash should get rid of the slug trail and mould. Smothered in dewberry oil it should be reight I think!?! Might try and re-line it if I get time xxx
7692 2018-11-13 13:45:08 If CA would stop allowing fracking, that would be helpful to CA and the environment as well.  Unfortunately, Jerry Brown seemed to be for it, as well as massive oil drilling in the state. Hopefully the new Gov. will be more environmentally conscious.
7693 2018-11-13 13:45:00 Keep the mosquitos away with a few drops of Eucalyptus Oil on your ankles &amp; wrists.
7694 2018-11-13 13:44:55 Plus if olive oil comes from olives where does baby oil come from?
7695 2018-11-13 13:44:54 Q's #M25 Clockwise at J9 #Leatherhead  -entry slip rd is closed for recovery of a broken down crane + clear up of an oil spill. Q's to J8 Reigate (slip rd may need to be resurfaced). Fi

1.) agree with him; 
2.) vote based-upon their immediate interests (oil & gas industry); 
or 
3.) disagree with him but it's way down their list of issues.

7699 2018-11-13 13:44:32 @ChrisMundyLdn It's not abuse.The Tory government has received huge donations from Palm oil companies and you genuinely think people are stupid enough to not realize that that is the real reason the ads been banned.

7702 2018-11-13 13:44:16 In case it wasn't crystal clear, Trump tweets about oil these days so he can keep trying to take credit for it if it continues to decline. If it doesn't someone/something else will be blamed. Fox news will echo it and its unwashed viewership will believe it.
7703 2018-11-13 13:43:52 All tyre companies trading high PE and earning is weak due to higher oil prices same with jubilant food where demand will be slow in coming month as in winter lots of other option also available
7704 2018-11-13 13:43:50 We have removed it wherever possible and 100% of the palm oil used in M&S products is RSPO certified. I hope this clarifies things and reassures you as to our commitments. Best wishes, Matt. 2/2
7705 2018-11-13 13:43:46 Dementia runs in my family. So I delt with a lot of people with it. I honestly suggested cbd oil to my family but we never tried it.
7706 2018-11-13 13:43:39 Disheartened that “big oil” convinced many here in WA state that a carbon tax was going to financially burden individuals.Their extraordinary amount of commercials and mail-flyers did the trick. Big money, big lies!
7707 2018-11-13 13:43:34 just make sure OUR strategic oil reserves are at full capacity
7708 2018-11-13 13:43:26 Hi Helena, thanks for contacting us about the use of palm oil in some of our food products. I'm happy to set out our position for you. We're committed to using only the most sustainable sources of palm oil in our products. 1/2

7713 2018-11-13 13:43:13 Drink plenty of water. Wear masks at all times. Wash your eyes often. And buy eucalyptus essential oil and take the steams.  It is supposed to be good. And drink plenty of water. Delhi air sucks

7715 2018-11-13 13:43:07 After buying @Ritzcrackers for ages and not realizing they contained palm oil, I was about to stop purchasing them, but I read the ingredients on a new box and it now contains sunflower oil instead!

7722 2018-11-13 13:41:59 I believe d way to restructure Nigeria is by taking power away frm d central. Let all d states in Nigeria begin to source their own revenue, Nigeria is highly blessed. I dnt understand d madness behind oil revenues.

7724 2018-11-13 13:41:44 For decades this Iranian regime has spent billions of dollars of the oil revenue on terrorist activities. It's time for the people of Iran to ask #WhereIsTheOilMoney ?
7725 2018-11-13 13:41:32 Hitler would have been a lot easier to beat had he not had a back door supply of oil.
It’s historic fact about how that was happening.

7747 2018-11-13 13:39:51 His horrific torture & murder demonstrates how corrupt the U.S. is because not only will WE ignore it, we’ll also continue w/business as usual because nothing speaks louder than oil/$

7754 2018-11-13 13:38:54 Well, in 2005 the Royal Dutch Shell was listed as the worst company in the world by the disaster in Niger and in 2013 by the oil platforms in Antarctica according to "Public Eyes".. Shell has nothing to do with that problem in Groningen?

7765 2018-11-13 13:37:40 The only fights are between informed people and people who are afraid of what they don't understand.  The oil companies love convincing people that nuclear power is scary and dangerous because they know it's their only real competition.  Some waste isotopes can even be reused.
7766 2018-11-13 13:37:38 How about addressing palm oil you use
7767 2018-11-13 13:37:34 Is it good? 

P.S. Trader Joe’s olive oil ruined all other olive oils for me.

7769 2018-11-13 13:37:14 The effects of withdrawal can last quite a while, though after 10 days you should be through the worst of it, post withdrawal symptoms can last up to 2 years. CBD oil would absolutely be beneficial is helping with those symptoms and balance your body. I’d definitely try some out!

It is a great shop and its palm oil advert sums it ethics and morals. I can afford to shop anywhere but I buy certain goods from Iceland
7773 2018-11-13 13:36:50 Also.... when you have to settle for the Bucks, so you can avoid the oil slick at work, you use the app and pre-order. In and out with no line. Express lane. Created.

7805 2018-11-13 13:33:42 Meanwhile there's currently so much oversupply of oil, the Saudis are trying to avoid the price bottoming out. This sounds a lot like a precursor to intentional supply restriction in order to drive up that demand, to drive up the price of oil.

7823 2018-11-13 13:31:51 Arab nations imposed embargoes, those were the origins in the 70's, not oil *companies*.  

Anything to get us away from depending on foreign sources, oil AND renewables, I'm all for.
7824 2018-11-13 13:31:37 I think most of us in the industry see locking CDN oil to only the US is the old US seeing our resources as theirs and wanting to “save it for later”. Especially now that US has unlocked some near term oil and gas of their own. Maybe time will tell if US needs our oil and gas...
7825 2018-11-13 13:31:36 Where there’s an Arms Deal there is a  way, our country is tearing up the rule book, palm oil, arms sales, EU and banning tv ads, “nothing to see here”. I’m sorry to say, they all go hand in hand.

7830 2018-11-13 13:31:13 We finally have a chance to transform the destructive #palmoil industry from within. Tell global palm oil body @RSPOtweets to vote to stop certifying companies like @Indofood that exploit people and land for cheap palm oil in its NEW principles #RSPO #RT16

7833 2018-11-13 13:31:06 I just made myself lunch of pasta shells with mushrooms and artichokes from jars, with generous amounts of salt, pepper and olive oil. How can something so simple and cheap be so good for the soul? I feel completely nourished by it. I also reckon @BootstrapCook would approve.
7834 2018-11-13 13:31:02 Will #palmoil standards body @RSPOtweets ever champion real sustainability? This week its members vote on whether to clamp down on labour abusers like @Indofood who go on selling palm oil marked with its logo #RT16 #RSPO
7835 2018-11-13 13:30:59 The move to renewables must happen. The reliance on oil must end.
7836 2018-11-13 13:30:52 in the case that it's closed comedones, AHAs seem to help and (in any case) I can also swear by nightly oil cleansing, especially if you wear sunscreen it ensures that everything on your skin comes off cleanly (and makes your skin feel so soft!)

7871 2018-11-13 13:28:31 As long as oil is between 55 and 65 I'm golden.
7872 2018-11-13 13:28:28 Don’t let it peel! Otherwise the colour will go and you’ll have to get it redone B keep it “moist”-put coconut oil on it
7873 2018-11-13 13:28:22 We can let our guys frack more - The higher the price the better it is for US Oil exploration - They cut production we should stop exploring
7874 2018-11-13 13:28:14 Same people upset about palm oil (all of a sudden after a cartoon- vegans been telling u about this for years) are the same people eating dirty burgers on Instagram. Looool don’t tell people to consume less palm oil when you’ve got chicken dippers for tea tonight
7875 2018-11-13 13:28:07 I though you knew this when we was just all talking about our birthdays  and you even mention me about the caster oil jae 
7876 2018-11-13 13:27:58 Humidifier with eucalyptus essential oil in it!
7877 2018-11-13 13:27:58 But do you use palm oil?
7878 2018-11-13 13:27:54 no lemon oil. its a concentrated form of lemons
7879 2018-11-13 13:27:45 Genau. Exactement. Und olive oil, butter...
7880 2018-11-13 13:27:44 -2 nato being strengthened, Ukraine being strengthened, Isis being destroyed, peace in the Korean Peninsula,Syria no longer gassing their ppl,Germany braking off oil deals with Russia and giving them to us, increased oil and nat gas deals with us from the EU, increased GDP, trade
7881 2018-11-13 13:27:43 Global demand?? Are we not conserving excess oil reserves for future generations of Americans? Is everything for sale in this country?
7882 2018-11-13 13:27:36 According to EU forecasts, traditional fossil fuel oil products will still represent 86% of transport sector energy needs in 2050. #CleanAirConf
7883 2018-11-13 13:27:29 Also the sausage and peppers reheats really well in a pan with some oil
7884 2018-11-13 13:27:28 @elonmusk any reason we can’t build a national water pipeline to move flood waters to ares of drought. Doesnt seem to be an issue for oil.

7886 2018-11-13 13:27:21 #IsItOk that because of Iceland people are finally doing something about palm oil sustainability!
7887 2018-11-13 13:27:15 RT "I just realized that Milan isn't Mediterranean, that is *butter not olive oil* (according to the Gallic Wars); perhaps it would be anathema to consume seppia there. Osso buco would be preferable."
7888 2018-11-13 13:27:10 Get your butter on! 

God I love butter. 

And olive oil.
7889 2018-11-13 13:27:05 what is lemon oil?? do u mean lemon juice?

7891 2018-11-13 13:26:58 Do we actually have any journalists who are interested in home grown Oil and Gas? Or are they all part of the green energy brigade these days?
7892 2018-11-13 13:26:56 あ！！！まって！！私この人知ってる！、！！！じしょう無色の動画あげてる人でしょ！！！！！！！！！！すきです！！！！！
7893 2018-11-13 13:26:52 We had oil reserves. Thatcher squandered the money to destroy our manufacturing base, throwing millions on the dole. Now we’re a finance & services economy. The Tories are economic vandals, and can’t be trusted. We must rebuild industry with high-tech skilled jobs a la @UKLabour
7894 2018-11-13 13:26:48 Trains are bad, but all pipelines leak, all of them. If we are going to invest, we need to invest in clean energy,  it oil.
7895 2018-11-13 13:26:41 He really gets up early with me and oil me down every morning 
7896 2018-11-13 13:26:37 You might want to have the oil changed in your sense of humor.
7897 2018-11-13 13:26:35 @thorntonschocs was going to buy some of your fudge but disappointed to see that you use palm oil in it. Needless to say I won’t be buying your products again. Please re look at substitutes to ensure we don’t leave the world in an even bigger mess for our children and animals
7898 2018-11-13 13:26:32 Le tout est d être prêt en groupe constitué et égalitaire.
7899 2018-11-13 13:26:30 Can we not *bounce* the Cabinet ...preferably on their heads and then into a large vat of boiling oil?
Happy to help.
7900 2018-11-13 13:26:29 Sigh. The price discount for some Canadian oil is not a "coincidence," it's basic economics.
7901 2018-11-13 13:26:25 It's okay to show endless hours of ads for Bookmakers, fast food companies, online gambling & alcohol, all of which are having a negative effect on society but you block an ad that has the potential to educate a generation on the environmental impact of palm oil use. #jobsworths

shamelnews
7904 2018-11-13 13:26:21 Well, China not buying US oil and gas does not change global demand. If US can sell its supply to others, it does not change global supply too. So global prices probably don't change much.
7905 2018-11-13 13:26:15 I hate when I start thinking like this.

Who told anyone-first human whatever- that if u crush certain plants you’d get  oil?

Did God reveal all these things?
How come there’s oil in the Bible?
Should I stop thinking?
7906 2018-11-13 13:26:05 I think part of the problem is that in that part of Norway the hills go straight into the sea with very little by way of shallows. Plus I read that the ship lost power very quickly, she was pushed into her current position with the help of tugs from the adjacent oil terminal.
7907 2018-11-13 13:26:05 Absolutely.
My point is that cutting out meat and being vegan *doesn't* save the planet.  
You can be a vegan and still involved in awful environmental destruction, since you will use palm oil products, plastic, fossil fuel, flights etc.  Veganism is a relatively small issue.
7908 2018-11-13 13:26:01 i cannot for the life of me understand why Rowley insist we fight up with oil and gas still #GECF #nodiversification. we not competitive and we have no markets
7909 2018-11-13 13:25:59 A three dollar bounce and crude oil would be modest based on normal cycle rhythms
7910 2018-11-13 13:25:55 Aldi do have a palm oil free one!
7911 2018-11-13 13:25:55 Oh, it's OK for the elites to use a little oil to fly around...and tell the rest of us how we're so bad and how they know better.

7917 2018-11-13 13:25:19 I’ve had rosehip oil a few times but for vaporizing and it’s definitely a more earthy rose scent ugh I love it. I love anything rose. But oooo Babo, I use that brand on my dogs!!! I think I wanna try the tatcha pore perfecting sunscreen but it’s out of stock everywhere
7918 2018-11-13 13:25:17 Rubbish. My Remainer mate always asking for practical assistance. Graduate of fuck all! Who runs a car out of oil??!!!
7919 2018-11-13 13:25:15 Black seed oil massaged into sore joints always helps me!
7920 2018-11-13 13:24:47 Well, you may be confused and Krause is most certainly confused, but economists are not confused. The idea of American environmental charities funding Candian anti-pipeline activists so American refineries can buy cheap Canadian oil is preposterous. Full stop.
7921 2018-11-13 13:24:42 Palm oil certification body @RSPOtweets will only be credible if its #palmoil growers like @Indofood eradicate exploitation, deforestation & destruction of ecologically precious peatland from plantations. They must use this weeks’ P&C vote well! #RT16 #RSPO
7922 2018-11-13 13:24:42 If you care about people and the planet, you should strongly support government investment in the clean safe transportation choices many people want: electric bus and rail plus cycling and walking. We need to move off dirty unhealthy oil as soon as possible.

7930 2018-11-13 13:23:27 #OOTT Steep drop in oil price. That is not new. However, USD is falling as well as the gigantic outstanding oil bonds become a burden for the bond market. Will we get a rate cut next meeting? Quite likely.
7931 2018-11-13 13:23:25 You do know that oil is not renewable right? It is a fixed supply. Perhaps if you hired competent, qualified staff you could understand this.
7932 2018-11-13 13:23:10 US saudi relationship has never been about ethics, it's only about oil. And control. Like the rest of the US and Russia foreign 'politics' = 'wars to free the world'.
7933 2018-11-13 13:23:05 same struggle, but I do find alternatives (in the UK) the worst is the sandwich bread or whatever is called here, really can't understand why using palm oil in there.

7939 2018-11-13 13:22:25 The Greens like the Liberals and the NDP certainly acknowledge climate change, but they also attempt to strike a balance between reducing emissions and oil production. To me, it's like balancing fighting flames with feeding the fire - the two objectives are irreconcilable.

The endangered Sumatran Tiger is also a victim as the equivalent of 300 football fields of rainforest is destroyed every hour to make way for palm oil plantations.

7952 2018-11-13 13:21:40 Questions? When a tariff is levied on a product imported from another country should the US consumer expect to pay more for that product? With oil prices up and consumer goods more expensive doesn't that make your tax cut essentially null and void?

7973 2018-11-13 13:19:37 He's probably referring to Sykes Picot.  An agreement in which Britain and France agreed to carve up the Middle East into separate spheres of influence to exploit the region for oil resources, basically causing a century + of chaos in the region.
7974 2018-11-13 13:19:36 The USSR was splitting the German fronts while the UK was taking the war to the Mediterranean (essentially saying fuck France, Belgium, the Niederlande, etc) to secure the Suez, India, and Iranian oil for themselves lol

7992 2018-11-13 13:18:28 Yes, indeed. Cali gets the earthquakes from all of the oil extraction over the decades. Then they have to deal with the droughts from "weather warfare". And now these fires too as a result of this weather modification activity. Its a beautiful spot, but it comes at a hefty price

8000 2018-11-13 13:17:00 Bit harsh on the SNP. Although they did mislead on the oil revenue tax pre referendum. The EU should have followed their own rules and not let Greece in to the Eurozone. Political rather than economic, now the Greek people pay for it.
8001 2018-11-13 13:16:56 That is a pathetic answer. What happens if Iran closes off the Gulf, Europe will be starved of oil within a week. There are numerous places where we can be hurt and blackmailed, weakness is pounced on.

8010 2018-11-13 13:16:07 I mean jobs on rigs can be easily transferred to energy jobs if oil wells have to shut down because they are unprofitable, fair enough tax breaks but they can’t not pay anything
8011 2018-11-13 13:15:59 No palm oil. #ChristmasMustHaves
8012 2018-11-13 13:15:48 It’s not only vegans that consume palm oil! It’s in thousands of products!! EVERYONE consumes/uses palm oil. Food, fuel, cleaning products, toiletries etc.
8013 2018-11-13 13:15:48 The corruption in US is on a nother level e.g they steal oil from Iraq but it  does not benefit a single individual to the detriment of others, the entire country benefits. that is how they r still standing
8014 2018-11-13 13:15:42 How do oil companies report "reserves" to the SEC when dealing with shale oil? Are reserves equal to acreage? i.e. one well in the Eagle-Ford "proves" then entire play? curious about how shale is reported compared to conventional plays. @SarahKentWSJ
8015 2018-11-13 13:15:36 $amrn @matthewherper @adamfeuerstein @skathire can anyone send me a reference on any studies showing effect of mineral oil on statin absorption or effect?  I couldn’t find anything. Thanks.

8018 2018-11-13 13:15:14 You obviously know nothing about the spread of palm oil plantations across Indonesia and Malaysia. Indonesia the entire oil production is derived from rainforest. Sustainable = no virgin rainforests can be cut down = plantations were previous virgin rainforest!
8019 2018-11-13 13:15:14 No sir, we now know exactly what is going on. Their hatred for PMB and his Gov is not based non performance ,but due to non renewal of their  oil block licences.
8020 2018-11-13 13:15:11 I do think we need a New Deal 2020 to transform our dependence on oil to green energy, and electric high speed rail for the whole country and semi trucks and cars this could reduce our carbon footprint, while innovation leads the way for new jobs and businesses. #NewDeal2020

Oh..but it's too expensive rn.

How much money are mortgage banks and big oil gouging us for over the same period of time?

A few dollars more than the costs above-mentioned

8093 2018-11-13 13:08:23 Government bond prices ended higher today, supported by lower than expected October CPI inflation print. Also, fall in crude oil prices eased concerns over a worsening of the current account deficit. However, profit booking by state-owned banks capped further gains.

8115 2018-11-13 13:06:19 Hey @IanShepherdson - curious on causation? Did oil plunge cause slowdown in global growth or was lower oil just a symptom most did not foresee? Slower growth that is
8116 2018-11-13 13:06:17 To sum up my thesis: Peak US growth (US-EU growth spread narrowing), peak yield differentials, peak us shale capex (possible higher oil), peak FED-ECB divergence, peak $DXY positioning

8135 2018-11-13 13:04:13 Well i must be thick then i will bow down to your superiority, in my world you make your statement to the world when you have got rid of palm oil not when when you are thinking of doing it in 2 or 5 years time
8136 2018-11-13 13:04:11 They have a great lavender oil bug spray. Also, I'm up 3 stories, so not as many flying insects.
8137 2018-11-13 13:04:00 I don’t buy @CadburyWorld and never will until they renounce palm oil.
8138 2018-11-13 13:03:57 buat tangan & kaki kl lagi kering, dan bibir (?) wkt itu pernah baca thread ttg bibir gitu biar sehat salah satunya pake olive oil sebelum tidur 
8139 2018-11-13 13:03:55 Well that may explain the violent move then.

If I wasn't knee deep in oil already I think I would buy.

Being drawn to copper and gold again right now. I make better money on them and Trump doesn't derail all my due dilligence for votes.
8140 2018-11-13 13:03:55 I believe adjustments are made to account for goods point of origin within the UK for exports. But businesses can fill out customs forms wrong and there's that not insignificant "Unknown Region" that doesn't only cover Oil & Gas exports and is oft bigger than ScotGov budget...

8144 2018-11-13 13:03:31 @Anna_Soubry, credit to you for letting yourself be convinced by @IcelandRichard about palm oil and the @IcelandFoods Christmas ad. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a politician change their mind on live TV before! 
8145 2018-11-13 13:03:28 By banning the Iceland advert about palm oil, it's probably now reached twice as many people, if not more, had it just aired on TV, due to everyone's bewilderment and anger of it being banned and therefore further determination to have it seen - the power of the internet, woo
8146 2018-11-13 13:03:16 Just stop buying palm oil & anything that contains it full stop. We don't need it, at all.
8147 2018-11-13 13:03:03 OK. But I know quite a few guys who graduated HS, went out West to work the rigs, saved their money. Did a lot better than those who stayed here, even given 'secure' jobs and good benefits. Now hope of those oil jobs gone for many.

8152 2018-11-13 13:02:48 Maybe because Richard Walker threatens your for profit agenda due to GMB being funded by products containing palm oil themselves? Maybe because he’s a truth teller? You’re journalists ffs, you’re meant to be on his side in holding corporations to account. At least he was honest.

8155 2018-11-13 13:02:27 Wish we could boycott Rapeseed Oil as well, that stuff makes me very ill to the point of vomiting if it's not cooked out of food. Most pastry has in it, reformed meat products and certain types of cooked chicken use it and it's crisps and bread.

You should be suspicious when $$ billions are involved.

Oil industry has a vested interest in $$ sales & so do scientists for $$ billions in grant money.

Foolish to close your eyes.

8189 2018-11-13 12:58:45 "Just"? Palm oil is so prolific I've found it impossible to avoid. It's in things I'd never think to check. We've minimised our palm oil use by buying local and aiming for zero waste.
8190 2018-11-13 12:58:21 AAPL and oil down yet futures up, seems bearish still.  You’re really thinking big upside today?
8191 2018-11-13 12:58:15 It IS politics!
Trump’s team has taken money from the logging industry.
The logging industry wants access to national parks.
Oil also wants in.
We need campaign finance reform.

8208 2018-11-13 12:56:32 Must have a little less packaging and Palm Oil (unless sourced from sustainable supplier) @marksandspencer and good will to all. More joy, love and peace would also be high on the list.

8228 2018-11-13 12:54:34 I think trump won’t take a drop in equities deeper in then what we saw last month. He will force Powell hand to not raise interest rates. And this move will drop the dollar send cryptos flying and oil. But, we must wait and see.
8229 2018-11-13 12:54:33 It doesn't take a great stretch of the imagination to conclude that a 'no deal' was perhaps first thought of on September 17, 2016. After all, Scotland is where the money is, with all that oil, gas and endless renewable electricity.

Actually not at all. 

But more divisiveness just pours oil into the fire.
Populism/post-factualism should be countered with fact-based responses.
Left/right are too broad categories, they don’t clearly exist .

We need a sober debate about values and definitions instead!
8242 2018-11-13 12:53:07 I have this year refrained from buying shampoo, shower gel, face creams etc in plastic containers or with palm oil.

8263 2018-11-13 12:50:10 PDP's problem is that it failed to achieve anything close in 16 yrs (when the oil price was high) preferring (as OBJ said) the goal of creating Nigerian billionaires; and that right now, it is only criticising Social Interventions without proposing anything better, or at all.
8264 2018-11-13 12:50:02 This push to boycott palm oil is fucking nonsense seriously. It obscures the actual issue at hand which is the exploitative economic system which has no issue with environmental destruction, human exploitation, and animal death.

It starts with cutting crap like shrimp on a treadmill.
Then a website for Fed that eliminates mortgage banks from the home buying "middleman" position.
Fed Energy sys to check big oil.
A gr8 start

Tip #11:
It's always good to check your oil and other fluid levels regularly especially after you refuel to look out for noticeable leaks throughout the engine compartment.

8283 2018-11-13 12:48:06 In February 2011, Citigroup projected that Nigeria would have the highest average GDP growth in the world in 2010–2050, this is far from reality.

8406 2018-11-13 12:38:05 Lol, they are nice ONCE in a while but they don’t have a significant health difference to fried eggs (using Butter or olive oil)
8407 2018-11-13 12:38:03 言葉の使い方おかしいことに今更気づくとは
8408 2018-11-13 12:38:02 So that being said, you can not trust a Nigerian with anything. If the people who discovered the oil were let to run the entire business, Nigeria would be far and at least have electricity 
8409 2018-11-13 12:37:56 I would like to see more vegan and palm oil free M&S products in keeping with the growing demand for meat/ Dairy free foods and  essential action for the environment and animals
8410 2018-11-13 12:37:46 Rash of news analysis articles today but rather than retweet, here’s summary upshot: US midterms have passed, but US-Saudi public disagreement on oil prices doesn’t appear to be over yet nor is fallout from Khashoggi matter resolved. US House Dem majority. You do the math.
8411 2018-11-13 12:37:43 My husband just got out of the Army. Bush was interested in oil wars. Trump is interested in protecting Americans. I’m hoping that this will show with a reduction in troop deaths.
8412 2018-11-13 12:37:38 Mi bardzo pomógł bio oil wiec może spróbuj tego
8413 2018-11-13 12:37:26 sama-sama! Kuncinya sering minum air putih yg cukup, pakai hydrating toner & moisturizer ya! kalo pakai olive oil ditaruh di step paling akhir pokoknya.
8414 2018-11-13 12:37:20 Wow that is stupid. Sanctions will reduce supply increasing prices. Russia exports oil and is one of the major oil producers on the planet. How you got that much stupid into one tweet is amazing
8415 2018-11-13 12:37:19 Dear Garnier
I have noted that in my little girls shampoo, Hydrogenated Glyceryl Palmate is present. Why is Palm Oil being used and also partially disguised?
8416 2018-11-13 12:37:15 I’ll make sure there will be butter as well.. or extra virgin olive oil.. 
8417 2018-11-13 12:37:10 Not exactly. An Independent Scotland will re-negotiate these rip off contracts. Where US oil companies get the oil dirt cheap
8418 2018-11-13 12:36:59 The article touches on carbon fees, and that's the key to this.  The country's engineers can create incredible technologies, but it will only get green-lit by industry if it's cost-effective.  As long as gas/oil are cheap, there's no driver to reduce emissions.
8419 2018-11-13 12:36:48 Nutella is made from Palm oil & Palm oil production is killing off the habitats of orangutans.  #BeBest watch @TheEllenShow without Nutella.

8422 2018-11-13 12:36:37 When isis was seizing oil fields, I thot a 2 year old could figure out what to do. Instead, Obama did nothing

Then isis starts undercutting the market by flooding the black market with cheap oil. Soon, isis is capitallly formed. Big time

And who's doing isis' banking...?

8426 2018-11-13 12:36:01 If our government didn’t give the nod in the first place this wouldn’t even be a topic in our nation! Oil and water don’t mix and this ideology is the worst of humanity mixed with those with mental weakness! We want them gone asap
8427 2018-11-13 12:35:58 As a Navigator in the 70/80ies we went to all sorts of places collecting palm oil. The industries were allowed to fall apart now big business needs to wreck forest to have massive plantations
8428 2018-11-13 12:35:49 Your minds need anointing oil and holy water for deep cleansing 
8429 2018-11-13 12:35:36 (1)Saying that I like Bernie does not in any way mean I think he’s perfect nor does it mean I make excuses for him. He accepted $11,129 from gun money in 2017. I’m not comfortable with that. Nor was I comfortable with Hillary accepting over $350k from oil & has industries

8440 2018-11-13 12:34:36 We are the reason they know so much about Oil we send our unfinished oil to them and then we buy it back 2x the price but trump thinks we are ripping them off, give them more money and then we give them jobs we should keep in our country 
8441 2018-11-13 12:34:36 EQT has been stealing money from owners smart enough to negotiate production costs for years. WV Supreme Court says 'can't, give it back, quit taking it". There is a class action to recover. Oil companies don't care, steal a lot, give some back, still cheaper than being honest.
8442 2018-11-13 12:34:19 vape oil. Please I must see
8443 2018-11-13 12:34:13 Love your Olive Oil one! #WorldKindnessDay
8444 2018-11-13 12:34:02 Wow! You just need some bread and olive oil, and you're set! Nobody would come near you in days, but that's a risk worth taking.
8445 2018-11-13 12:33:53 Fill the keyhole with light machine oil or palm oil. Let sip in and soak.
8446 2018-11-13 12:33:49 Boycotting palm oil isnt ideal. Palm oil is the highest yield oil production per hectare. If we were to start producing other oils (coconut being the closest, at less than half yield), we only displace the issue and cause further damage. Capitalism, the profit motive is the issue
8447 2018-11-13 12:33:41 Oil down bigly inflation soft reserves high - Dollar very strong - I think we are getting way too anxious.
8448 2018-11-13 12:33:28 You've been influenced by the oil suckers

8450 2018-11-13 12:33:24 Fantastic that you're highlighting the environmental cost of palm oil 
8451 2018-11-13 12:33:15 Power oil 
8452 2018-11-13 12:33:05 So in answer to the question you aren't, instead of eliminating the use of palm oil you are sourcing from what 'you claim' are sustainable sources..
8453 2018-11-13 12:33:01 With dwindling oil prices and ever growing National expenses the required $8Billion yearly investment in addressing Nigeria’s Pollution concerns has to be raised from alternative sources like the Private sector. #FGSanitationEmergency
8454 2018-11-13 12:32:55 The most useless thing ever. Same as bio oil.
8455 2018-11-13 12:32:31 Not only is GOP finished. America is staring at hard times with the foxes in charge of the henhouse.
8456 2018-11-13 12:32:17 The proportion of palm oil globally certified by RSPO? Just 19%! Sure, 19% is better than nothing but PLEASE don't make me laugh. The RSPO is a token organisation that came into play to pretend to tackle the main culprits which just happens to be Malaysia.
8457 2018-11-13 12:32:07 Breathatarian? It's the only thing that has absolutely NO impact on planet or animals! Also - completely impossible. Palm oil & soya are almost 99% used for animal feed & bio-fuels. Deforestation is grazing and crops for animals. Veganism is the least harm in a harmful world 
8458 2018-11-13 12:32:02 And the entire US Govt isn't a corrupt institution filled with corrupt revolving door MIC, Wall St, Big Bank, Pharma, Oil, etc. Insiders- that's bombing +8 countries that never attacked us? Top FBI agent Jim Comey made +$6 MILLION in ONE YEAR as a Lockheed Martin consultant.
8459 2018-11-13 12:31:57 Right now is the most bullish I’ve seen oil in a long time.

Highly right translated low forming meaning the petrol pump won’t be looking so pretty mid 2019

8468 2018-11-13 12:30:24 You see, when oil hit ~$76usd they were screaming $100 oil.  Immediate sell signal.

Starting to buy toward the end of Nov for the “V” bounce on “time”

Then we will see $100 oil 

For some

#OEX also been rising from bottom &still rising. look at mcap.
even at current sp 0.6p OEX, mcap still low at 13m. compare that to oil/gas companies with comparable TCF, you will see mcap for OEX is still very low and more rise to come imo

8490 2018-11-13 12:27:32 Hi Nenée! We are currently phasing out palm oil and switching to other saturated vegetable fats (coconut oil, rapeseed oil and coconut oil). This will be done gradually. This means that iFraiche no longer will contain any palm oil! All the best, Oatly
8491 2018-11-13 12:27:32 For topical I wouldn’t recommend those I think you can definitely still use for diffusers depending on if you just want the relaxing smell or uplifting effects but if you want to use the smell for say for a cold I’d go for a diluted 100% oil, and you’re welcome

8514 2018-11-13 12:25:09 I found palm oil in an M&S meat pie.  I am really shocked.  Please advise why you are using palm oil.  I thought you had stopped its use?
8515 2018-11-13 12:25:08 I’ve never used coconut oil as lube because I’m not a fucking peasant and I can afford to buy actual lube but I can imagine it makes the whole thing smell kinda Tropicana.

8520 2018-11-13 12:24:53 Bad news to those addicted to sanction: 
In the first six months of Iranian calendar year (21 March-21 September 2018):
-Iran’s non-oil exports: US$ 23.1 billion (increased by 13%)
-Imports: US$ 22.2 billion
-Non-oil trade balance surplus: US$ 945 million
8521 2018-11-13 12:24:50 I agree with the above comment ^ id still make sure the oils you’re using are 100%. I recommend plant therapy they are 100% plus not overpriced. It also depends on your type of pet. For example lavender oil is generally safe for adult dogs but definitely not for cats

8567 2018-11-13 12:20:20 Absolutely. It's great to get that message out there re palm oil. But it's also very clever; I know someone works in social media PR; they say the amount of views they can get via SM smashes TV viewings. So I think Iceland were pretty savvy

8634 2018-11-13 12:14:18 Let's agree to differ - we are both trying to save the planet one way or another.

Imho there are many worse environmental problems than meat production. Palm oil, for example, which is ok for vegans?
My argument is that we shouldn't oversimplify. Slogans won't save the planet.
8635 2018-11-13 12:14:13 Well, WW1 the US waited til everyone lost millions til they intervened and  WW2 the US waited until Russia beat Nazi Germany until they intervened.

So waiting for the US to intervene (when there's no oil) is a costly thing.

8678 2018-11-13 12:09:17 Weh rame bener wkwk
Btw aku cuma tusuk kapsul nya pake jarum trus pencet sma keluar minyaknya. Usapin deh ke muka jd semacem face oil gtu
8679 2018-11-13 12:09:16 Why put any other oil in peanut butter in the first place :) Peanuts are fatty enough.
8680 2018-11-13 12:09:07 #TuesdayThoughts I'll have to be extra careful with the food that I eat outside. I wonder if they cooked my roast chicken with peanut oil. If they did, I'm gonna kill them cause I'm severely allergic to peanut oil. I think that I'm also allergic to the sauce that they gave me
8681 2018-11-13 12:08:53 Yes, Saudi Arabia is ally of Isreal and America ( they sell their oil thru petroldoller) they're responsible for sponsoring ISIS and terrorism.  God has promised that in the Quran that the same Isreal and America whom Saudi supports will attack Saudi Arabia. They will shout loud
8682 2018-11-13 12:08:52 How can you possibly blame remainers. Just admit you’ve been lied to and own the disastrous Brexit you voted for. Brexit was never going to be good for anyone apart from wealthy snake oil salesmen 
8683 2018-11-13 12:08:52 From what I understand you get the highest yield per sqm with palm oil than any other type of oil. So, a ban would see production switch to another oil that potentially requires greater deforestation! Reducing consumption is the only answer. periods.
8684 2018-11-13 12:08:51 Then we all need to try harder, rely less on the stuff (CO2-generating gas, oil, coal + plus nuclear for-which-there-is-no-solution waste) that will kill us all through human-driven extenction of species upon which depend, let alone climate & weather.
8685 2018-11-13 12:08:43 I've got my baby oil ready in anticipation of the jungle shower scene 
8686 2018-11-13 12:08:36 Light sweet crude oil fell 0.4% to $59.93 per barrel, marking the 11th consecutive session of losses, the longest in data going back to 1983. Comments from President Trump negated expectations that the global oil cartel and its allies will cut production.
8687 2018-11-13 12:08:29  Have you checked out the figures on renewables in Scotland let alone oil and gas?  Typical tory, opens mouth and load of untrue lies come out.
8688 2018-11-13 12:07:55 Wondering how many of the 670,000 plus signatures wanting the 'banned' #IcelandChristmasAdvert ad to be aired on terrestrial TV have just popped out to the shops and purchased products that use palm oil in its packaging ?? 
8689 2018-11-13 12:07:21 Hilarious. My energy company are putting up the cost of my electricity due to the increasing price of oil. Yet they claim that all their electricity is wind generated in the UK (yeah, like).
8690 2018-11-13 12:07:03 The crew and I were getting stuck into the @collarofgold mayo and chips during the Ad breaks. We just about had enough left for Martin & guests . A lovely oil. Well done on another beautiful product from the Boyne Valley

8694 2018-11-13 12:06:27 "Palm oil is not the enemy"? You're right. Big Business is the enemy building HUGE palm oil farms monopolising the supply chain. So, for now, "Palm oil IS the enemy" given who the largest producers are.
8695 2018-11-13 12:06:26 Having the best oil and tires helps too.  Thanks T.J.

8699 2018-11-13 12:05:55 If Al Gore got elected in 2000, the Democrats definitely would've done something about climate change. Clinton and Obama were aberrations, Unlike them, Gore definitely would've put a muzzle on the MiC, tamed the energy industry, and halted fracking and oil pipeline development.
8700 2018-11-13 12:05:48 Hi Todd just wondering what would prevent from folks buying much cheaper cbd oil once Farm Bill is done and hemp CBD legal?  Is that a risk maybe hence sell-off?
8701 2018-11-13 12:05:40 Major oil producers said that crude supply next year would outstrip demand, calling for new strategies based on production adjustments. Saudi Arabia said that the Kingdom would cut its production by 500,000 barrels per day
8702 2018-11-13 12:05:35 Oh that sounds just as good! how long does it take to make the oil?

8706 2018-11-13 12:04:46 PETA supports the move towards sustainable palm oil, which doesn't involve devastating destruction of orangutans' homes. We encourage consumers to check food labels & if it contains palm oil to purchase products that have been certified by the Palm Oil Innovation Group. 1/2

8714 2018-11-13 12:03:58 OPEC warned on Tuesday that an oil supply glut could emerge in  2019 as the world economy slows and supply from rival producers rises  more quickly than expected, building a case for cutting output at a  meeting next month.
8715 2018-11-13 12:03:53 but in other products it is still used whilst we continue our research on suitable alternatives. Where palm oil is used, please be assured it’s fully sustainable and certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). [2/2]
8716 2018-11-13 12:03:43 Hi, palm oil has been used by the food industry for many years but please be assured our research into suitable alternatives continues as we’re keen to do the right thing. We have recently removed palm oil from our potato products [1/2]
8717 2018-11-13 12:03:33 Short answer: they have a lot of oil. So we don’t know what to do.
8718 2018-11-13 12:03:24 That’s totally incorrect. Consumption far outweighs what happens in the oil patch. We had significant imports that skewed that period.

8726 2018-11-13 12:01:54 There has been a phenomenal amount of work around responsible palm oil in the food industry with things like the palm oil round table. All very much unseen when headline grabbing becomes the objective.

8730 2018-11-13 12:01:39 Its probably easier for me because I grow most of m own food, but I stil won't buy anything with Palm Oil in such as shampoo, soaps, animal foods.  Certified or not it is as you quite rightly fear, wiping out unique ecosystems. Profit lines are the only thing companies understand
8731 2018-11-13 12:01:38 Unfortunately there are too many of these snake oil salesfolk around and customers don't understand what they are buying.
8732 2018-11-13 12:01:37 Apart from the fact oil supply is finite. Sell it all cheap then it runs out and then what?

8809 2018-11-13 11:53:02 Everything is political but people do confuse @Greenpeace (activists not lobbyists) with @TheGreenParty (which IS political) And - furthermore, we need to stop using palm oil so any means necessary. Ad campaigns included.

8816 2018-11-13 11:52:23 I dont trust them - we are still no nearer to a referendum. Water is a worldwide industry more lucrative than oil. We have won a battle not the water. Respect your view also.

In that entire neurosis, you remember that there wasn't much you've really had wrong with yourself. You were drowned in a sea of what constituted oil, when you were its spark. Unfortunately, the relationship between oil and flame is nothing short of hell.

8839 2018-11-13 11:49:47 Yes Nikki. We never use palm oil in our chocolate, yet small amounts come indirectly from added ingredients, such as biscuits. In all cases our suppliers are RSPO certified which guarantees the palm oil is sustainably sourced. We're on track to be palm oil free by the end of 2019
8840 2018-11-13 11:49:41 @sainsburys  so what will Sainsbury’s do to reduce palm oil based profits in your stores?  @IcelandFoods are leading the way - it’s not about competition.  It’s about being responsible

Get behind today's technology, not continued capitalism, and protection of already rich investors who are happy to keep destroying OUR planet to get richer. It's time for the population of the world not countries to revolt
8862 2018-11-13 11:46:50 Because unlike every other European nation of less than 10 million population Scotland is uniquely unable to survive. Add the curse of significant oil reserves (which appear suddenly not to be running out) and we will be like Somalia with sleet. What  utter nonsense.

8864 2018-11-13 11:46:36 I don't think they do look at long lists of ingredients - I'd wager that it puts more people off looking & understanding than it does panic them. Ingredients like palm oil are often hidden in lists as well.
8865 2018-11-13 11:46:26 Trump has no respect for all Americans. And thinking crude oil is cheap to extract and transport is wrong, He is killing a big part of US economy
8866 2018-11-13 11:46:19 Ball & Osbourne say that next year with more oil production we will be much better off .My question if thats true how will we achieve this when the Terra Nova will be on dry dock for a year in Europe. Then another Rig will down for six mnts later . Mr Ball your a Liar.
8867 2018-11-13 11:46:13 For Russia that’s a peak (because Russia government pay women to not have an abortion and it kind of dropped when they cut the budget because of low oil price in the late 2014).
8868 2018-11-13 11:46:12 None of this makes a difference. You guys and our responsible UK will still bend over for Saudi oil and money.

8872 2018-11-13 11:45:44 If have thought you'd want them to slow production. In fact, I'm surprised you didn't add tariffs to protect oil producers here in the USA. I'm guessing big oil didn't contribute enough to your campaign to buy your influence. Why the inconsistency?

8910 2018-11-13 11:41:44 It’s a great ad and not at all “too political” but Iceland need to be transparent as yes they have removed their own label products with palm oil in but still continue to sell over 200 products from other companies containing palm oil.
8911 2018-11-13 11:41:37 You missed the point though. He wasn't saying palm oil was bad, just that it needs to be more ethically sourced and where possible removed from products.  It's too idealistic to say just remove 200 plus products.    You kind of missed his points by talking over him.
8912 2018-11-13 11:41:36 the best substitute for palm oil is vegetable oil. Vegetable oil, with its lower yield, requires double the amount of land and deforestation. Hence seems better to buy from a sustainable and certified source of palm oil.

8934 2018-11-13 11:39:27 great. So you substitute palm oil with vegetable oil (the most reasonable substitute there?), which has less yield then palm oil and requires double the amount of land/deforestation? Stick to RSPO sources, I don't see the problem.

8959 2018-11-13 11:36:43 Don't break your heads. Answer is very simple. If transportation of coal, oil, machinery etc by waterways over seas from between countries  is economical and adopted universally so is transportation by inland waterways from one city to another  city whereever it is feasible.

9063 2018-11-13 11:23:38 Biofuels will offset 2.5m bpd of oil demand by 2040, while natural gas usage in cars offsets 1.6m bpd. The IEA forecasts that oil demand will fall sharply in advanced economies, with the EU seeing a 45% decline by 2040, while North America falls by 25%.

9065 2018-11-13 11:23:33 Whole Earth peanut butter still has palm oil in it (albeit certified). I buy the Albert Heijn store brand with nothing but peanuts and salt ;)
9066 2018-11-13 11:23:33 Mostly natural resources. Mineral products (nickel, copper etc), wood, paper. 
We would love to send them more oil but  too many transportation bottlenecks. At least that is what i believe the problem is.
9067 2018-11-13 11:23:29 After a 24% jump in total oil consumption between 2000 and 2017 to 95m bpd, absolute demand is set to increase by only 12% in the years to 2040 to 106m bpd.
9068 2018-11-13 11:23:25 Then what govt will do..now you admitted govt wants to do nothing..

Oops I forgot..they might change name of crude oil to Amrut 
9069 2018-11-13 11:23:23 The IEA said oil consumption in cars will hit a ceiling by the middle of the next decade as adoption of electric vehicles becomes more widespread and more fuel-efficient automobiles hit the road.

It is your decision which seems political to me.

9188 2018-11-13 11:10:09 In 2017, total real GDP growth rate increased sharply to 8.1% .

However, this was driven by the oil sector (due to additional oil from TEN and Sankofa).

9190 2018-11-13 11:09:57 I do Sue. We have been avoiding palm oil where possible for years. I’m even dubious about rainforest alliance palm oil and try to avoid that. It’s in everything.
9191 2018-11-13 11:09:46 Was it? I thought Piers Morgan made a very good point, stop all products containing palm oil!
9192 2018-11-13 11:09:43 Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!@@realDonaldTrump
9193 2018-11-13 11:09:38 Sure.  But at that point it was clear that it would be entirely capable of it, and somewhat poorer.  The calculation now different.  Oil decisively gone [indy worse].  UK poorer as a whole [smaller subsidies into Scotland, so indy less damaging].  Possible hard Brexit [unclear].

9201 2018-11-13 11:08:16 In this turbulent market manipulators are having a great time taking trades to the extreme upside and downside.

They buy $natgas(major resistance 4) and sell $oil(major support 58)

I fear $dxy maybe next --> 100, what will happen to the stock market?
9202 2018-11-13 11:08:10 @Ocado I don't want to buy anything containing palm oil. When will Ocado see the light and drop all products with palm oil or at least give a "palm oil free" stamp so I can easily make my choices? It could be like the Fair Trade certification. Easy for busy customers.
9203 2018-11-13 11:08:05 So you believe that oil price will drop and reach a bottom three weeks from now? Thanks for sharing your thoughts

9210 2018-11-13 11:07:26 Really think we should be applauding #IcelandAdvert for taking out palm oil from their products. It was a ridiculous statement to say they should remove all branded products, it's a supermarket!! Customers still want choice and where one person leads others will follow 
9211 2018-11-13 11:07:21 better yet, dont eat anything with palm oil in it
9212 2018-11-13 11:07:18 I’m shocked at the amount of products that use palm oil
9213 2018-11-13 11:07:04 lol not even close. way too high cost. and that's only 1 item we need oil for...what about planes, plastics, rubber, personal hygiene products...
9214 2018-11-13 11:06:55 Just how can u lower the price of oil.. hurting my portfolio badly
9215 2018-11-13 11:06:52 Hmmmm ? HSBC has a vested interest in palm oil to the tune of around 18 billion. Hmmmm I wonder if maybe  they also don't give a flying f:ck either?

9224 2018-11-13 11:05:54 @Oreo why are you destroying more rainforests for palm oil where you shouldn't be? You are touching land which does not belong to you. Do you have any compassion for the wildlife and also the people whos land you are stealing from. Slave labour, animals dying!! #awful
9225 2018-11-13 11:05:41 World has already started its journey towards renewable energy sources. Oil will be used less and less in coming decades

9231 2018-11-13 11:04:18 So if u go to war its not for your own benefit? How about no war? I know oil and money is more worth then human lives. RIP everyone who died for that!
9232 2018-11-13 11:04:17 @Oreo your golden cookies are my favourite, but I will no longer eat them because of the palm oil. Do you have any plans of changing your ingredients?

9236 2018-11-13 11:03:43 I'm doing an MSc in Oil and Gas Engineering with research focusing on storing CO2 in the karoo rocks to reduce emissions and avoid the imminent carbon tax on our nation. I'd appreciate it if you funded me seeing it's in line with what you're doing.
9237 2018-11-13 11:03:32 May I point out border biscuits that there is no such thing as sustainable palm oil as there were major flaws found in the traceability of ‘sustainable’ palm oil. You could also visit like the ceo of Iceland stores did and see for yourself

9241 2018-11-13 11:03:14 even if you are sensitive to fried food, you only need a tablespoon of oil to pan fry your chicken.  

If that is still too much, my condolences.
9242 2018-11-13 11:03:05 The price of oil is on a drastic decline once again. Let’s continue to lie to ourselves that we are a rich nation after years of waste and mismanagement. When we become a serious nation, we will finally implement the recommendations of Steve Oronsaye’a Report and truly cut costs.
9243 2018-11-13 11:03:03 To say they don't use as much on the boat is wrong. They have families still at home with the same expenses. Mortgage, insurance, taxes, school,  food,  transportation...

9247 2018-11-13 11:02:34 Thanks for this .

Now explain this :-

2016-2017 

Entire oil revenues -334m 

2017-2018

Entire oil tax revenues 1.4bn 

Youre deficit in 2017-2018 is 14.7bn AFTER applying geographical share of oil 

Youre short of 13bn 

Htf does that "bail out" the deficit ??
9248 2018-11-13 11:02:30 All you smart folk why hasn't the petrol price gone down since Oil is at it's lowest level since the rapid increases of Thuma Mina? The Rand hasn't changed so don't mention it...

9268 2018-11-13 11:00:23 Everyone can make a difference:
*Read ingredients before buying food.
*Do not buy products containing palm oil.
*Note the manufacturers.
*Ask for the supermarket's comments book & tell them what you are doing.
*Write to the manufacturers of the products you're not buying.

9326 2018-11-13 10:52:07 Hi Jay, may be your system was right but again this time Oil spoiled ht party and bulls won it.
9327 2018-11-13 10:51:54 Depends on the underlying premise. Sanctions on RUS are limited, RUS is not Iran, its impact on the markets is far reaching, especially since the market is losing Iranian oil/gas outputs again. Afterall, determination - based on fundamental interests -cant be stopped by sanctions
9328 2018-11-13 10:51:39 Gas prices were high under Obama too, and under the Bushes. It all started because of George H W Bush and his ban on domestic oil drilling, this making him and his family even more wealthy. Also leading to desert Storm.
9329 2018-11-13 10:51:36 it's Awesome that the world is being made aware of deforestation & the decline of the Orangutans,,,even tho @IcelandFoods have pledged to stop using palm oil in there own brand products, they still sell other brands which use & contain palm oil which is hypocritical, STOP IT ALL!

There. Fixed it for you.
9339 2018-11-13 10:50:04 It would seem that people in high places have a vested interest in palm oil. Tell the truth and shame the devil.

9358 2018-11-13 10:47:26 I have seen various news reports on this subject today. They all have similar headlines but much of what they reported is contradictory. Until they say Omega 3 fish oil is killing me rather than it is inconclusive on benefits I will continue to take. My doctor suggested it helps.

9381 2018-11-13 10:45:57 Say Iceland do that. Then go out of business. None of the big supermarkets then have any pressure to change their own stock and they keep the palm oil trade going. That’s 25,000 jobs gone and no company pushing for change. Why not just be happy someone is trying?
9382 2018-11-13 10:45:56 Our global commitment for the top 10 sourcing is to be sustainably sourced by 2020. The first category that has achieved this commitment is palm oil with 100% responsible sourcing reached in 2015, and we aim to stay 100% responsible for the years to come. Thanks!
9383 2018-11-13 10:45:48 Yes. Don't bet against the guy who controls $ 600 billion cash and 
235 billion bbl of oil.
9384 2018-11-13 10:45:44 Everyone on FinTwit is showing how much funds have unwound oil longs from record levels and how unprecedented it is... yet no talk about dollar positioning or bond positioning. I'm sure that will all come to light on FinTwit when a big move happens.

9394 2018-11-13 10:44:14 Actually according to the BBC they DID ban it. Clearcast cannot ban, they don't have the power to do so. Only the ASA can ban adverts. So, yeah, rise up against them. It's just down to how much they took from the Palm Oil industry to ban it.

9400 2018-11-13 10:43:40 That's interesting because the Iceland Director of Corporate Affairs has just admitted to me that the alternatives they use are ones which cause far more deforestation than palm oil.

9408 2018-11-13 10:42:38 Yeah doping and oil money is hilarious 
9409 2018-11-13 10:42:32 The Norwegian oil-for-trade alternative isn't really an option here either. We need energy infrastructure investment, especially in renewable heat and green transport, to support a truly green economy, both internally and externally.
9410 2018-11-13 10:42:30 Thing is they often don't faff around with locks. 
They stuff a hot copper pipe through the bottom of a plastic tank; pinch your oil and leave you with a ruined tank.

9412 2018-11-13 10:42:23 We know we’ll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel & have to use sustainable energy eventually, so why not go renewable now & avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? Betting that science is wrong & oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far …
9413 2018-11-13 10:42:03 Exactly! The best thing about the video is it’s emotional impact which caused a discussion, but it isn’t black and white like everyone thinks and we need to spread the sustainable palm oil message!
9414 2018-11-13 10:41:56 They did not grow taxable businesses to generate govt revenue. They both engaged in social interventions beyond state pockets by borrowing while praying oil price continues to rise. The result is unsustainable debts. Fed govt coughs out 69% of its revenues to service debts.
9415 2018-11-13 10:41:55 Sugar, smoking, oil, the list is endless. You’re all puppets and don’t even realised it
9416 2018-11-13 10:41:54 Maybe so but he's admitted to me that instead of palm oil they use alternatives which according to the RSPO cause far more deforestation! The total hypocrisy of the whole thing. Duping the public is never a good thing.

9418 2018-11-13 10:41:36 Actually a true cost of energy must include the human costs including the never ending oil wars and such atrocities. I would say that’s not even quantifiable.
9419 2018-11-13 10:41:26 And they did it without oil money and abiding by the rules....

9460 2018-11-13 10:35:38 Post Katrina, gas/oil demand dropped 3 months in a row during late spring. Gas prices still skyrocketed. In oil/gas, supply and demand are the same lie as trickle down economics is in tax cuts.
9461 2018-11-13 10:35:34 As you know I have been very careful and conservative with trading oil for the last two weeks but now even I am surprised with the speed of the sell off. I am sold puts 58 and 59 for this week and looking to keep the contracts if I get exercised on Friday.

9464 2018-11-13 10:35:06 You forget who your dealing with! the prices they will set will have nothing to do with how much oil is available, it will have to do with how much they pump! This is so they can set the price they want so as to become richer!

9469 2018-11-13 10:33:59 Don’t think it’s controversial at all. The destruction of habitats to make way for palm oil plantations is well known.

9473 2018-11-13 10:33:12 On this point I can pour oil on troubled waters: the 'obsession' I was referring to belongs to Media Lens. But I really do believe that we need to focus our efforts and not attack the 'good' when it doesn't achieve our particular notions of the 'perfect'.
9474 2018-11-13 10:32:56 Is this a joke? Truth and Kamala Harris are like oil and water.
9475 2018-11-13 10:32:53 Completely agree! It shouldn't be about 'banning' the use of palm oil like everyone is taking from the advert, it's about making it more sustainable, otherwise succession will lead to even more land being used for other oils to meet the exact same demand for oil...

9477 2018-11-13 10:32:40 I’m already aware of this, but the fact is why would you use palm oil in a sugar dusting? It’s unnecessarily adding fat for the sake of having a more powdery dusting...

9595 2018-11-13 10:20:00 Hi there, thanks for posting. All palm oil used in our own-label food products has come from sustainable RSPO-certified sources since 2015. This position is being extended to non-food products by the end of 2018. Thanks again

9597 2018-11-13 10:19:44 If 9/11 couldn't punish SaudiA, it would be naive to think Khashoggi's murder would.
Global oil demand in 2018 is ~20% higher than in 2001.
9598 2018-11-13 10:19:42 Just as a bank owns your house until the mortgage is paid, HSBC owns Clearcast, the company that pulled #IcelandAdvert. HSBC has $18bn investment in palm oil

9601 2018-11-13 10:19:17 David Attenborough single-handedly killed plastic straws and now Iceland gonna take down the palm oil industry. Fucking Iceland. It is time to step up and hold ourselves environmentally accountable!
9602 2018-11-13 10:19:15 Why aren't you releasing the FREE ENERGY patents and technologies that have been suppressed? 
No wonder this planet is in such a state when the world's governments are keeping the population dependant on OIL to keep lining their pockets.

Funny that those opposing the war included those branded 'loony-lefties' when they said we shouldn't support Saddam when he was committing genocide against the Marsh Arabs and gassing the people of Halabja. You know, when he was on our side, before threatening "our" oil.
9614 2018-11-13 10:17:36 Incredible this oil...Talk about a falling knife.
9615 2018-11-13 10:17:30 I listened to a guy who was very knowledgable on this subject. Like us, he was concerned about the damage to the environment. He said that production of palm oil is not as harmful as most of the alternatives, but we have to address the destruction of natural rainforest. Too right

9748 2018-11-13 09:58:20 The oil companies offer damned good jobs so I don't fault people who work for them. We need to shift the thinking and tax policy to clean energy jobs.... It's happening but too slowly....we need the green wave!

9755 2018-11-13 09:57:09 Hey @chicagotown, can I ask if the palm oil in your products is sustainably sourced? The @IcelandFoods / @GreenpeaceUK advert has encouraged me to become a more responsible consumer and I’d hate to give up your pizzas as they are the best.
9756 2018-11-13 09:57:02 Hypocrite. Why don’t you show real commitment to not using oil products? Are you prepared to give up using your car, heating your home, cooking your meals, wearing clothes containing polymers?

9805 2018-11-13 09:49:05 I agree that every step towards eating more ethically is a good one, for sure! Less meat, less palm oil, less water-intensive crops... but it is just a simple fact that meat production (particularly beef) has the biggest footprint: extensive water/land use & methane production.

9809 2018-11-13 09:48:31 A question: Since India is buying oil from Iran in rupees, how much sense does it make to calculate prices ONLY in USD for India? If it turns out cheaper to buy oil only in rupees, don't you think majority of Indian oil imports will slowly shift to Iran?
9810 2018-11-13 09:48:23 @RENskincare Can you help me out. I've been using your products for sometime now, however I've just discovered that you use Palm Oil derivatives in your potions. Is this true and if so, how can you claim to be cruelty free if this is the case?
9811 2018-11-13 09:48:20 Palm oil isn't just damaging the environment but, it is one of the worst trans-fats that we can put in our bodies. Possibly the main reason why we are becoming a fat nation as the damned stuff is in nearly everything, rapeseed oil is much better for us than Palm fats.

Wild Horse targeting 480million barrels.
I'm going with 200m being added to mkt cap

When Pmo hit Mexico 100m was added to mkt cap on 250m barrels
Oil Was 50$ a barrel then.
Oil is now 70$

9879 2018-11-13 09:39:06 People should be asking themselves 'what are Iceland using instead of palm oil?'
9880 2018-11-13 09:39:04 Aku pernah pake face washnya. Bau tea treenya kenceng. Bikin wajah ketarik abis make ini. Setelah pake ini semingguan jerawat makin parah. Ternyata dia literally strip out natural oil in my face. Kulitku jd dehidrasi. Not going to repurchase this.
9881 2018-11-13 09:38:53 Please stop using palm oil in yours products.  #Oreo
9882 2018-11-13 09:38:50 Well done to GMB and @piersmorgan in particular for calling out @IcelandFoodsPR over their hypocritical stance on the use of palm oil.  They saw an opportunity for cheap publicity and jumped on it and thought no one would see that Iceland are part of the problem!
9883 2018-11-13 09:38:41 My favourite version of Scotland is not the one which looks to wars of the past, to oil, to corrupt trading of sugar and tobacco. 
It's the one which looks forward to equality, better distribution of wealth, renewable energies, better living. 
That one is still possible, right?

Reduce fuel ooo
9892 2018-11-13 09:37:43 There seems to be more and more animal issues that need addressing, palm oil, trophy hunting, orca and dolphin capture,climate change denial etc etc.

We need some way of coordinating action to stop this madness!
9893 2018-11-13 09:37:39 Yea whether we like it or not they’ll disappear anyways, ignoring all the natural disasters stuff we have finite amount of oil 

We do have finite amount of sun too but by the time we start running out of sun we’ll have much bigger problems than not driving cars
9894 2018-11-13 09:37:31 Our main source of money has come about through constant success in the past, you can say Man City are bigger through recent years but that’s beside the point that they have no history at all and have had to turn to oil to make them some what a ‘big club’

9898 2018-11-13 09:37:07 PDP and other parties should focus on issues: unemployment, oil subsidies, education, healthcare, transportation, power, privatization.
These are DOCILE  issues against this aberration. There's no time to fight in the village square. 
The incumbent wants you all to be distracted.
9899 2018-11-13 09:37:05 There are things like coconut oil that are antimicrobial that animals love as well as Calcium Bentonite and DE that cost pennies and help the animals with a variety of things. Like worms, fleas, etc.  We were given tool to help ourselves.  Things didn't have to be invented.

9912 2018-11-13 09:35:47 Isn't it promoting a reduction in palm oil consumption over Christmas, rather than an all-out boycott, and also raising general awareness?

9924 2018-11-13 09:34:40 Getting rly annoyed with everyone retweeting that Iceland advert knowing there’s very little chance they will actually stop buying products with palm oil in. Spread the message yeah but the real difference would come from stopping buying the products that contain it 
9925 2018-11-13 09:34:28 Lol we are not ready, most of us prefer collecting peanuts to become E-thugs and the cycle continues
9926 2018-11-13 09:34:10 I would love to buy these products in the uk oil seriously reduces the need to inhale.

9932 2018-11-13 09:33:36 I’d seen an FSC sustainable palm oil stamp on some @JordansCereals products but wondered if there really was such a thing? (I know it exists - but I wonder if it’s acceptable?). 
Well done on getting this debate into newsprint.

9938 2018-11-13 09:33:01 Thank you for highlighting terrible cost to our planet of using #PalmOil oil. It’s pernicious and tucked into products you’d never image (well, you would, but most wouldn’t.)I hope the ad being banned has created even more awareness @IcelandRichard @IcelandFoods #ecofriendly
9939 2018-11-13 09:32:57 Dead Yemenis are collateral damage to the arms trade, just as extinct orangutans are collateral damage to the palm oil trade. The common denominator is HSBC.
9940 2018-11-13 09:32:51 U do know opec has decided to cut back on oil production so to raise oil prices and that means higher gas prices

9948 2018-11-13 09:31:40 well thats more than coming out of Angus at the moment.
1 every 3 days...Im not convinced on that.
as I say. RNS. not speculation for me.
9949 2018-11-13 09:31:31 Proper management of national resources. We've found oil in commercial quantity. We have a government who says one of the best way to use this resources is to educate the children of the land for free, cause the human resource of the land is critical.

9951 2018-11-13 09:31:13 Napoleon dug the hole for England to destroyed its trade in entire Europe but at the end he himself trapped into his own hole. Similar situation is created by @realDonaldTrump to stop Iranian oil by imposing sanctions on their oil industry. What happened next is clearly visible
9952 2018-11-13 09:31:00 You took that baby oil joke to an unprecedented level

9963 2018-11-13 09:29:51 The collapse in the price of a barrel of oil and US sanctions. Then you have the CIA black ops doing all they can to destabilise the country. This is a familiar scenario long established by the USA against left wing Governments from Chile, Nicaragua  through Latin America.
9964 2018-11-13 09:29:32 I remember about hearing of a highly elaborate phishing scam that got a company to send an oil tanker one day earlier. So when company expecting it called to complain the oil was long gone.
9965 2018-11-13 09:29:20 This is what happens when you are hell bent on opposing anything that BJP does. First thing It's not 86.29 Rupees. Second, Government doesn't control prices, oil companies do and they don't immediately reduce or increase prices, they do it after watching the trend for some time.
9966 2018-11-13 09:29:15 As highlighted in a recent @IUCN report, banning palm oil will simply displace #biodiversity loss. A better solution is to work with the entire supply chain to promote the use of #sustainable standards, such as RSPO, with a view to improve the sustainability of the entire market.

9969 2018-11-13 09:28:52 I think it’s part of their diet range, so sometimes you get things like ‘half a teaspoon of oil’ which I just ignore, but honestly if you can read you can make the recipes well!

9971 2018-11-13 09:28:40 You and I don't need to work out a whole system for everyone at all places and times. If oil looks cheap (ie 2016), buy oil. If drug co.s developing new drugs look cheap, buy drug co.s, if Latin America looks cheap, buy assets in LatAm. Etc.

They can also subsidize the medicine for the people in need.

9986 2018-11-13 09:26:32 Wonder if people know what contains palm oil
9987 2018-11-13 09:26:16 You were excellent and l don’t know how you kept your patience.   I fully support Iceland and Greenpeace on banning palm oil

Not to mention that apparently, the US passed Russia in the last few weeks, and is now the largest global producer of oil.
