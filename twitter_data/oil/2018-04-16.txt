9 2018-04-16 23:59:26 Yep. The US lies to start wars& steals the natural resources from our targets. We stole millions of barrels from Iraq & currently "control" most of Syria's oil. Cui bono? Large oil conglomerates & their political cronies. Our military has been turned into mercenaries for Big Oil.
10 2018-04-16 23:59:25 Only in #America can you get mad at a country for "allegedly" doing a poison gas strike on it's own people and then try to rationalize it by bombing them back to the stone age in retaliation. Smh.... Y'all still fighting over #Oil #pipelines  in #Syria or what? #Russia
11 2018-04-16 23:59:24 My dude gotta be down for the fire pics and heavy with the coconut oil 
12 2018-04-16 23:59:23 How is it wrong for the economy? It will create jobs building the pipeline. Create jobs in the oil fields, that will create spin-off jobs in local economies. So how is this bad for the economy?
13 2018-04-16 23:59:16 Yeah , this is a small rural town so it's a heating oil situation. And the fact that his health insurance (medicare) has him in a "donut hole" so his insulin pens and what not are $588 out of pocket each month. So they are just drowning right now with the grandson moving in.
14 2018-04-16 23:59:15 We are already in court with BC. Come and game! It will take months to get a court order and then Alberta will appeal if oil ban is not allowed. But before then, enjoy walking to work for the next 12 months.
15 2018-04-16 23:59:14 What ! A sane environmental decision ? Excellent news, just about every oil & gas well since 1947 has been ‘fracked’, it’s opponents, who’s objective is energy control, only surfaced after they introduced horizontal drilling to the process & increased production by magnitudes.
16 2018-04-16 23:59:04 thats rich people oil
17 2018-04-16 23:59:01 I hope boiling oil or melted lead was involved.

41 2018-04-16 23:58:34 The Oil industry backed the Temperance movement which led to prohibition. Why ? Because of the alcohol engine. They have many ways to buy politicians and people but it all begins with $$$$

42 2018-04-16 23:58:23 CBD oil is meant to be good for it.
43 2018-04-16 23:57:37 @JFlashGordonMMA i have a question, i know alot of fighters use CBD oil for chronic pain, but can you test positive for THC as a result of using it? Does it really help alleviate chronic pain?
44 2018-04-16 23:57:36 Hey friend I know it's not always easy but I do know that it will pass. You're not alone! 

I would suggest getting some oil pastels and some paper, then without intention or forethought explore the space with some color freely like a child might. You may find some answers
45 2018-04-16 23:57:32 Henry is mocking it.... why have you got so much castor oil in your beard? Man are calling it disco beard 
46 2018-04-16 23:57:25 Why does Alberta share oil profits..I'm not aware of that
47 2018-04-16 23:57:19 the guy next to me at publix just got a 12 inch white bread sub that was just. turkey and olive oil. that’s it. that’s all that was on it. i
48 2018-04-16 23:56:46 True. However wait till the Churchill agreement empire's and they bring the oil from the Gulf of St. Lawrence ashore. A pipeline to Quebec City, St. John and the USA will be built overnight without a whimper from Ottawa.
49 2018-04-16 23:56:44 No it will not. Not only are they billions in debt, they don't clean up oil spills nor have the technology to, furthermore the more you think china is more important than BC  - in CANADA- the more likely you will be charged down the line in our system.
50 2018-04-16 23:56:31 Is it made with real truffle oil?
51 2018-04-16 23:56:22 Yes. Alberta oil- which provides benefit when sold to the whole country -is transport constrained. The TMX expansion provides access to new markets and removes the constraint thereby increases returns at the wellhead and benefit to all Canadians.
52 2018-04-16 23:56:21 Even today the sand eats up vehicles and weapons. The Brits learned in the Great War not to oil their rifles.
53 2018-04-16 23:56:16 Dee take care!! Stay healthy and happy and add oil at work  Jin loves you right back 
54 2018-04-16 23:56:14 One time I had the munchies and wanted to make myself some fried Oreos. I put the oil in the pan and was so confused why it was taking so long to get hot and fry the cookies. My brother comes in about 15 mins later and turned on the stove. #StonerStories
55 2018-04-16 23:56:00 Respected CGI Sir @cgidubai We are 21 Indians on oil tanker SALA 1. No salary, no repatriation for almost 5 months. Owner not responding. Need immediate Gov't. assistance. Location Khor Fakkan Anchorage. Ship Owner: ECB. Manning incharge: Aurum Ship Management
56 2018-04-16 23:55:48 Look up how to make it. It’s beyond amazing. And if you save and strain bacon fat rendered from your morning bacon, use that in place of veg oil to make the mayo. Bacon mayonnaise. It is glorious.
57 2018-04-16 23:55:37 I’m looking for a black owned business selling black soap, castor oil and Shea butter...please help me support.
58 2018-04-16 23:55:15 The places that take oil containers also take def containers, I assume they get recycled there.  But good to keep some to fill from tote to keep warm for the winter
59 2018-04-16 23:55:13 No charge for fixing the belt that was their fault & a free oil change. The least they can do.
60 2018-04-16 23:54:53 Why does Israel attack Syria all the time Israel controls 80% of Syrian oil guarded by US solders Do they have to have it all?
61 2018-04-16 23:54:53 How do you feel about mct oil
62 2018-04-16 23:54:41 Dear Black people..... youd be surprise how much you could do woth coconut oil....#yourewelcome
63 2018-04-16 23:54:38 That an oil tanker full of 650 000 barrels of oil in a densely populated City, over an extremely sensitive marine eco-system would have catastrophic consequences to Vancouver and the creatures that depend on the ocean, in the event of a fire or spill. Correct?
64 2018-04-16 23:54:35 No other oil producing country , unlike Canada, would strangle its own energy industry to allow 700k barrels from Saudi, etc to be imported daily.

65 2018-04-16 23:54:31 The thing with conspiracy theories is that they all always have some semblance of truth to them... So admit that you are really looking to scrap the constitution and lean towards an autocratic leader who will bring the USA in a different direction... thats what you're saying!
66 2018-04-16 23:54:29 Argan oil is liquid gold
67 2018-04-16 23:54:28 Oil is one of Canada's largest exports... 
If you're willing to paying 15 dollars for a California cauliflower in Canadian off-season, then I think that's an excellent idea.
68 2018-04-16 23:54:21 Actually @CPC_HQ, #TransMountain does NOT serve Canada's best interests. It was oil that caused Canada to run up massive deficits while your party was in power and why Alberta is in such dire economic straights. #SuckItUp #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #ProtecttheInlet #CPCTears
69 2018-04-16 23:54:03 I do hear that argument. Lots unknown right now (at least publicly). I think what happens depends a lot on how much oil  is ultimately discovered in ANWR, and how easily recoverable it is. From there, I think, it's a cold, hard question of economics for the oil cos.

72 2018-04-16 23:53:34 Are they tied to Big Oil?
73 2018-04-16 23:53:29 One thing that confuses me: AB wants oil to the coast because it's in the "national interest". Does that mean limiting refined products to BC is also in the national interest? Or, "you're doing something wrong, so we'll do something wrong"? That's coercion, yes?

76 2018-04-16 23:52:47 Perhaps it would be in our national interest to add value to raw bitumen in our country rather than risk our environment just to get the global price for our crude. North America remains a net importer of oil.
77 2018-04-16 23:52:46 The rational Mike is that the only reason we are increasing oil tanker shipments from the Westridge Marine Terminal is to sell this extra oil, from increased oil patch production to Asia. Correct?
78 2018-04-16 23:52:30 @RachelNotley This bill will send the Oil company board rooms into fits of laughter ... generated by their disbelief of such a petty childish move by a government body.
79 2018-04-16 23:52:25 Chris, listen to me. I need you to rescue two hostages from an underwater oil field. Agent Sherry Birkin... ...and Jake Muller. He's Albert Wesker's son.
80 2018-04-16 23:52:15 did your dick smell like fresh oil?
if it did, i think miu would like some.
81 2018-04-16 23:52:13 Zinke went to Israel to ok right wing politician Etiam (who said Israeli Arabs a cancer) as head of oil company Afek Oil to extract ‘Israel’s’ oil in Golan Heights wonder how that was ‘interior’
82 2018-04-16 23:52:08 Smashed mini yellows with skins on, green onions, butter, olive oil and umm...some cream cheese. Hee hee.
83 2018-04-16 23:51:55 So the #UNITEDSTATES Is aiding in a #war in another country about #oil. #UnitedStates you are deplorable. Shame on you for risking young people’s live for you FUCKIN ##GREED #AMERICA AINT SHIT
84 2018-04-16 23:51:52 Some are also concerned that canola oil is not a food crop, especially when sent to China.
85 2018-04-16 23:51:47 Lmao get you some oil of olay or something. 

On the plus side, if I make it to your bar while I'm out there, I can ask for the old dude, and I'm sure they'll know exactly who I'm talking about 
86 2018-04-16 23:51:31 Buy some black soap and a baby rag and baby oil !
87 2018-04-16 23:50:54 I didn’t love the book I just finished. I wanted to but the main character rubbed me the wrong way. And the ending had too many holes for my liking. That’s what happens when I impulse buy books at Costco when I’m there to purchase a jar of coconut oil the size of my head.
88 2018-04-16 23:50:50 when i did get my nails done, it was about $30-$40 plus tip and your right, i don’t have to do my hair. I shower and put some coconut oil in there and I’m naturally all set :) not really sure who you are to talk anyways lmao, nobody was talking to you 
89 2018-04-16 23:50:48 My lemon-flavored cod liver oil just went down very easily in a bit of citrus-flavored sparkling water!

I was out of juice, so on a whim I used the water, and it worked very well.
90 2018-04-16 23:50:41 Yes, it does sound like it's similar. I used to use tea tree oil on the few that I got and it cleared them up within two weeks.
91 2018-04-16 23:50:40 Seems like you might need our prosperity face wash + love body oil!
92 2018-04-16 23:50:34 All my friends that went with me to the Que set is now going to the oil spill...... we all finna be litty tity
93 2018-04-16 23:50:05 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
94 2018-04-16 23:49:48 If anyone thinks an oil contract by the highest indebted nation in debt to gdp in the modern world will be gold backed that’s exactly as mistaken

99 2018-04-16 23:49:01 Woof. That's a bad look.

As an aside, I think something the oil and gas industry needs to do is advertise some advancements in their technologies and innovations and help educate. They've built and designed some neat products.

102 2018-04-16 23:48:59 Not even a beard oil, Vita Coca coconut oil,massage it in after shower try not to use it daily because it has conditioning agents and that could make your beard too soft but the right amount thickens it up and keeps it healthy
103 2018-04-16 23:48:46 There's only one reason why @theresa_may, @realDonaldTrump and Macron bombed Syria. That wasn't to protect the Syrian people but to destroy the country then steal all of its oil just like they've done before. All three of them are a bunch of bastards.
104 2018-04-16 23:48:45 On wood vs oil & coal: it all depends on what you're burning. Much of the bioenergy the EU is incentivising is far, far worse in climate terms than fossil fuels. See our (WWF EU) briefing paper on EU bioenergy policy.
105 2018-04-16 23:48:41 Find a football players from @FtballAtTheView and buy a card from him. Only $20 and will help us to fund many things this season like Guardian caps, uniforms, food for post weights. I have plenty so buy more than one for great price deal on oil change/tire rotation
106 2018-04-16 23:48:17 Bernard's logic is completely unfounded. Using guilt by association where there isn't any. If the shooter drove a Ford, he'd blame the mechanic who did the oil change the day before.

Take heart: Ducktales is the one I would want if I was stranded on a desert island with just one show. And a DVD player that ran off of coconut oil.
117 2018-04-16 23:46:36 No shit Batman, but without the oil going to tidewater, thereby not getting a fair market value, we r losing investment dollars and you’ll never get another refinery built without investment $ to use our own oil, and thus keep importing conflict oil from despots around the world
118 2018-04-16 23:46:24 Very wrong yung erase!! Dapat pala nag-shark oil na lang ako 
119 2018-04-16 23:46:20 I tarted it up with olive oil and salt and pepper and even some cherry tomatoes, but then I just ate it right out of the bowl. No regrets.
120 2018-04-16 23:46:16 Tea tree products from the body shop have always worked a charm for me!! But don’t buy the cheap tea tree oil from other places as that doesn’t work the same way the body shop products do! I use the night lotion, the wee stick you get and the body wash x
121 2018-04-16 23:46:14 @AnthonyCumiacm hey on the show today I thought you said US was top oil exporter in world. I don't see that anywhere. Top oil producer but not in top 10 of exports.
122 2018-04-16 23:45:53 I use the peppermint halo oil blend from Saje with a cool gel eye mask & it has worked miracles with my migraines.

127 2018-04-16 23:45:13 Yeah, agree somewhat, but if we were setting up the oil industry from scratch today, we'd say a plan for what it looks like now would be 'over-engineered' too. At least they are thinking! #imagen an enormous #katabatic wind farm  plugged into this network

138 2018-04-16 23:44:15 There is absolutely no evidence that any permanent employment will result, outside of the oil patch(s) as a result of increasing oil patch production for the purpose of selling and shipping this oil to Asia.

140 2018-04-16 23:43:37 I like it that way. If I'm feeling fat I will chop up some bacon and use that instead of olive oil.

144 2018-04-16 23:43:27 @RachelNotley Oil And Gas Exemptions Prices For Producing. Oil Derived Products Of 4000. Is Absolute. Best Quality For The Best Price.
145 2018-04-16 23:43:26 Why does an oil company need taxpayers' money? Don't we already pay enough at the pumps? This is nuts.
146 2018-04-16 23:43:25 Denali’s oil content is pretty special - love the aroma I got when dry hopping with it!
147 2018-04-16 23:43:14 Olbas oil is a true gift from god. I can breathe again

149 2018-04-16 23:42:55 all the more reason why ANWR makes so little sense to me. at current oil prices there's no way that drilling in the refuge could be profitable.. and it's certainly not going to close the enlarged fed deficit. why risk the refuge when so much of NPR-A is undeveloped?
150 2018-04-16 23:42:29 YES supports oil spills
151 2018-04-16 23:42:21 @MassOMEGA1Miss_LAScoutt shout out to you.... Hello there is it alot of fish to catch up and get caught?  Well thank goodness for the Omega1 fish oil to keep everything that isnt working smoothed out. Stay healthy.
152 2018-04-16 23:42:11 I wonder how many oil executives have summer homes in BC ?   hint : all
153 2018-04-16 23:41:54 No they are not. Andrew. Please. For the tanker to light on fire, something has to happen to it. Again, risk is the chance of the incident and the impact of the incident. We agree there's lots of oil in the tanker. The probability of the incident is where we disagree. 1/
154 2018-04-16 23:41:53 I have a problem on my skin when I was in Thailand my skin was oil but now it's dry and also had a pimples scar . Fuck it off
155 2018-04-16 23:41:50 I usually just sauté it with olive oil, salt, and pepper.
156 2018-04-16 23:41:48 You should be able to get them anywhere they sell protein shakes. Like a gnc or make a homemade one. I usually do like almond milk, oatmeal, peanut butter, (coconut oil back in the day) bananas
157 2018-04-16 23:41:22 Salish Sea trivia: Roughly one half of all the oil carried in ships locally is fuel oil used to propel various types of vessels, tankers included. The other half is oil transported in tank vessels, including tankers, barges, etc.
158 2018-04-16 23:41:22 No @ShannonStubbsMP, first nations ard opposed to the #TransMountain pipeline and increased oil tankers on the coast. Disgraceful how @CPC_HQ are trying to force your pipeline and #Alberta's self interests on the people of BC. #Shameful. #ProtecttheInlet #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli
159 2018-04-16 23:41:08 So you're saying diluted bitumen is the same as oil?  Or are you just sounding off?
#cdnpoli
160 2018-04-16 23:41:00 Trudeau should impose the same standards to oil imported by Quebec as he does for Canadian oil. Those protesters that are paid to stop our petroleum industry should be blockading dirty oil coming into Quebec. Fat chance that would really happen. Hypocrites!
161 2018-04-16 23:40:58 Mulberry dressing, puree, touch of honey and olive oil.
162 2018-04-16 23:40:53 Um, nothing too special.  Just cooked the macaroni, added back in about half a cup of pasta water and a quarter cup of olive oil, tossed in some parsley before mixing in the roasted vegetables.
163 2018-04-16 23:40:44 It's not emotional Mike...is completely rational. Is it not true that the only reason we are increasing shipments of oil through the Burrad Inlet is to sell oil to Asia? That's what I heard come out of @jimcarr_wpg 's mouth yesterday!
164 2018-04-16 23:40:43 I’d say BP, Shell and Exxon are begins the attack. I wouldn’t be surprised if Gazprom was ok with it as well. 

US/Russia oil cartels splitting up Syria like Russia and Germany did with Poland in 1939.
165 2018-04-16 23:40:27 Darn tootin!
166 2018-04-16 23:40:22 I know this guy who used to change Soro's oil in his car.  Seemed like a nice guy, but probably ran Benghazi.
167 2018-04-16 23:40:16 泣いてなんかいないよ、これは心の油だ。
168 2018-04-16 23:40:08 Actually I wouldn’t even buy snake oil from the man!
169 2018-04-16 23:40:01 Warm the coconut oil and just rub it on me
170 2018-04-16 23:40:00 oil
171 2018-04-16 23:39:51 Tea tree oil works the quickest for me
172 2018-04-16 23:39:48 Only on paper. They got a big raise. Oil n metal prices shot up. They get paid dollars and get more rubles for dollars. Actually helped their bottom line.  Didn't hurt them at all.
173 2018-04-16 23:39:37 Just filled up on truffle oil mac & cheese w lobster. I can die happy now
174 2018-04-16 23:39:28 It is not BC fault the Oil industry went into the crapper.
175 2018-04-16 23:39:22 @RachelNotley We Give Manufactures Price Exemptions On Oil. In Order To Produce The Highest Quality Oil Derived Products At The Best Prices.
176 2018-04-16 23:39:11 It was good. I wish i could put less oil. But still decent
177 2018-04-16 23:39:05 My boyfriend is using cbd oil for back pain and it's been great thus far.
178 2018-04-16 23:39:03 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot

180 2018-04-16 23:38:47 I do love that @STWuk tweeted pictures of 'no war for oil' posters. There is no oil in Syria no cities either now
181 2018-04-16 23:38:36 Carter Page and "good judgement" are oil and water.
182 2018-04-16 23:38:29 الحين ما عرفنا انتوا ضد الاعتصام مع العمال بالتسويق المحلي  ولا معاه ؟؟

183 2018-04-16 23:38:27 Do you remember when Harper shut down the Kitsilano coast guard and left it up to the city to do any oil spill response?

Harper's complete stupidity lead to a 12hr oil leak in English Bay, it was Greggor (city hall) that organized a clean up - which is a federal responsibility.
184 2018-04-16 23:38:27 @siavoshsia 
I remember seeing pictures of your country in the 1970s I ran hasn’t started war with anyone in over 200 years it’s America that’s always starting war putting in puppet regime is stealing peoples wealth gold oil We know what they’re doing
185 2018-04-16 23:38:03 It's called twinning of the pipelines. Or have you not been paying attention? Current said pipeline only services BC... For people that hate oil that's odd. They should all go out and buy electric cars then. Wonder how they got to the construction site
186 2018-04-16 23:37:51 Absolutely not, the parallels with respect to the oil fire risk is even greater with the Burrard Inlet due to the amount of oil in an oil tanker, the close proximity to dense populations and the recent oil fire examples we can apply, to what could happen here!
187 2018-04-16 23:37:50 Kitchen Tip: If a recipe calls for honey, coat the measuring spoon with a little oil so that the honey slides right off.
188 2018-04-16 23:37:48 Accidentally buying a can of tuna in oil instead of water &lt;&lt;&lt;
189 2018-04-16 23:37:32 Hahaha. Do they want oil or not?
190 2018-04-16 23:37:27 castor oil for sure
191 2018-04-16 23:37:17 "resources", including fisheries, forests, beaver fur, water, asbestos, electricity, etc.

"Resources" is not just oil.  Excluding the valuation of other resources, or lumping them all together, only serves to promote a single industry at the expense of others.
192 2018-04-16 23:37:06 Mmkay I got you. Jamaican Castor Oil or Canola?

197 2018-04-16 23:35:58 They are the same, except for the fact that they carry not only Bunker C but also around one million barrels of oil. Just a minor detail. LOL
198 2018-04-16 23:35:56 Question: has Alberta been shipping oil  for free?
199 2018-04-16 23:35:55 stuck w oil? JT usually just heats it up a tiny bit to loosen the oil and it works every time
200 2018-04-16 23:35:43 Salad. Who in Pakistan or Afghanistan has enough oil to make it worth them. Nobody, so please put that old piece of garbage away. As of last month, the USA is the largest oil producer on Earth!

206 2018-04-16 23:35:02 one moment i was telling my dad about weed vapes, and the next thing you know, he wants me to buy him CBD oil for back pain. 

also, he “doesn’t want to know” how i’ll get it (a store) despite it being legal
207 2018-04-16 23:34:53 You have no clue. Just shut the oil flow off and move on. Your whining and smugness is getting old
208 2018-04-16 23:34:49 Migration Watch isn't "leading edge". It has a very specific agenda and pushes it very succesfully masqurading as reliable. As reliable as climate change sceptic organsiaitons funded by oil companies. 
No one else agrees. Economic benefits real. But not spread out or done well.
209 2018-04-16 23:34:43 Fried, when I went back to it I started using 1 cal spray oil instead of the same pan each day with an ever increasing amount of rendered bacon fat

211 2018-04-16 23:34:05 educating you is rude? I've heard these claims before regarding oil and banking, they're not rooted in reality. Just trying to open your eyes
212 2018-04-16 23:34:04 Chili oil is a nice addition to the sirloin marinate. Nice heat. Nose is running.
213 2018-04-16 23:34:00 @echocharles can you explain the difference between Super Krill and Joint Warfare?  Isn’t krill oil also for joints?

215 2018-04-16 23:33:47 More money isn't happening but HIGHER EXPENSES is!  Remember trumps statement about sell our oil supplies?  Is THAT why gas prices have jumped by 20 cents a gallon?  Why is it that my healthcare insurance is too expensive to afford?
216 2018-04-16 23:33:45 my mom wants to take me to the new cbd oil store to get some stuff!! which is great and cool but there are constantly cops sitting everywhere so ur not catching my poc ass going near it
217 2018-04-16 23:33:36 I fucking hate this shit!
It's not demonic possession. 
There is no such thing. 
These "exorcisms" are dangerous and often lead to life long psychological issues and in extreme cases, death.
These "exorcists" are nothing more than snake oil salesmen.
218 2018-04-16 23:33:27 So Alberta is going to cut all their oil profits and pay for Kinder Morgan's pipeline so that they can punish BC for trying to protect its waters. Meanwhile, Kinder Morgan laughs all the way to the bank...
219 2018-04-16 23:33:14 Look at Alberta for what happens when resources dry up (due to oil prices there)
220 2018-04-16 23:33:04 Lol, the one who still need some understanding to do is you, you compare USA to Nigeria in terms of oil import, if we have so much crude oil what I'm telling you is we should at least refine 80% of what we consume, apparently your research gave you wrong recommendations
221 2018-04-16 23:33:03 I feel like I've heard oil of cloves was an old-timey toothache remedy? And there's always whiskey of course...
222 2018-04-16 23:33:02 Use avocado oil for best results
223 2018-04-16 23:32:44 Omg the dipping oil. So good. More places need bread and dipping oils.
224 2018-04-16 23:32:36 @RachelNotley Oil Is Resposible To Make 4000 Products In The World. Alberta Should Be Making 4000 Products For A Export Industries. Assets.
225 2018-04-16 23:32:17 Doesn't america just want to change its name is "liars" and be done with it. The world knows you want the oil in syria. The world knows you're funding isis and we know the united nations is a front to go in and collect artillery. Like we know, so who are you fronting for?
226 2018-04-16 23:32:15 Beat an egg up, dip the avocado in it and pour breadcrumbs all over then put in a pan with oil 
227 2018-04-16 23:32:01 @ccpa Great Seth Kline interview on @CBCNews

I am so sick of all the lies they tell
228 2018-04-16 23:31:48 “Our current structure has been sustained by oil revenues. We can’t afford to wait till oil becomes insignificant before we reposition our country.” we need @atiku for restructuring

231 2018-04-16 23:31:36 You could try burning sage, or have a priest come bless the house. You could try anointting several spots around the house with holy water or anointing oil. Also, paranormal stuff has been happening all day at my house too! My dogs been barking at literally nothing.... help?
232 2018-04-16 23:31:35 More Mercenaries? Is there anything left in Iraq, besides the oil?
233 2018-04-16 23:31:34 @shanellekaulCTV I just watched you do live hit on @CTVNews about the move by @RachelNotley and noticed how biased you were on a NATIONAL  broadcast which I was watching here in #BritishColumbia  Notley is not compromising rather she is strong arming  on behalf of Texas Oil

236 2018-04-16 23:31:24 Oil is NOT a fossil fuel!!  It is renewable just like water
237 2018-04-16 23:31:23 NO Mike, we aren't measuring anything to justify you pushing for oil being sold to Asia for quick Alberta Tax Dollars by oil tanker. We don't need to measure risk with Lac-Mégantic because it already happened. We're trying to prevent it from happening again here.
238 2018-04-16 23:31:23 BOTH snake oil charmer for Trump and the Republican Party agenda to remove the wealth from the people and give it only to the one percenters!!!!
239 2018-04-16 23:31:06 Andrew, you're hurting your case by harping on Lac-Mégantic. They are two completely different regulatory environments. The people of Lac-Mégantic didn't know oil was being transported through their town. We do and we can ensure that appropriate measures are taken 1/
240 2018-04-16 23:31:06 Mac and cheese- use homemade roux, mild and sharp cheddar, but first fry lots of veggies in butter and olive oil, add chopped walnuts and flax seed, when it's done add more romano grated on top, a little mild red pepper power

2) And you neglected to mention the ones most at risk, with the largest investments - oil companies like Exxon and Conoco Phillips
245 2018-04-16 23:30:16 There is no middle ground, it's either chalk or it's cheese, it's oil or it's water, saying they're the same doesn't make it true. Time to #ScrapTheGRA. The only thing to do with bad legislation is abolish it.

253 2018-04-16 23:29:40 bc has a lot of earthquakes  your gov going to be dishing out  a lot  for  pipe breaks   and the law suits  that follow  would probably bankrupt  the oil companys
254 2018-04-16 23:29:22 I ran out of coconut oil and i went to the store and forgot to get some
255 2018-04-16 23:29:20 I wonder how many millions of dollars would be spent in that referendum by oil companies?
256 2018-04-16 23:29:16 Hey @keithbaldrey  If B.C banned oil by rail would that theoretically mean that a new Kinder Morgan pipeline would be cornered into just replacing rail capacity leaving nothing left to ship to Asia via tanker?? #bcpoli #TransMountain #KinderMorgan
257 2018-04-16 23:29:15 Simply do not let this man sell his snake oil!
258 2018-04-16 23:28:59 NO Blair, Alberta wants to increase production in the oil patch so they can produce enough extra oil to turn a quick buck by selling that to Asia. That is the ONLY reason we're even having this discussion. You said an incident in the Burrard Inlet would be catastrophic. True?
259 2018-04-16 23:28:52 Not to mention all these carbon taxes on gasoline at home heating oil
260 2018-04-16 23:28:19 The russian control over the oil industry is far reaching. Local conflicts are keeping the prices up since actually there is a glut of supply. Everybody concerned is actually happy over the current situation, no need to blow up another off shore drilling rig for now
261 2018-04-16 23:28:13 Is almond oil good to use on your face?
262 2018-04-16 23:28:02 except that Iraq is control of their own oil lol. I don't think you've used your critical thinking skills as much as you like to think. You're on a conspiracy theory bandwagon that consists of "but oil and the Rothschild family!!" Read a bit about them by the way

266 2018-04-16 23:27:32 I don't believe there is any possibility of sustainable palm oil anymore & needs to be replaced with a healthier alternative.
267 2018-04-16 23:27:31 Lmao olive oil hair sheen my guy
268 2018-04-16 23:27:23 oregano, a little oil, shredded parm reg, & pepper
269 2018-04-16 23:27:19 New brakes, oil change and finally got a stubborn old shock taken out and new one put on.
270 2018-04-16 23:27:08 They are the worst. Went for oil change and on my way back my engine check light turned on. Went I took my car to change the oil, it was on great condition. They wanted me to pay so they can check my engine.
271 2018-04-16 23:27:06 Personally I haven't found drying necessary but others like the result. I've found a good result when adjusting flow, temperature & speed, but I'm also very specific in my nozzle size & layer height preferences for what could be a mass flow sweet spot. Also not afraid to oil :-)
272 2018-04-16 23:27:06 It seems to me if Alberta is allowed to cut off the flow of oil in the name of regional self interest it is a clear demonstration that BC is justified to pursue it's own regional interests at the expense of other jurisdictions, including the Federal. 4/

276 2018-04-16 23:26:46 Bc needs oil . Ab has it.  Ab needs fresh water lakes to play in.  Bc has it.  This could grind our economies while US has a laugh all the way to the bank.  Ego will send us all to the poor house!

285 2018-04-16 23:25:39 That is all we need to hear. We have huge energy projects just waiting to produce their potash, oil and more. Thankyou Prime Minister Trudeau for fulfilling your promises. These Canadians that are so negative, maybe they would like to be in a ridiculous war!!
286 2018-04-16 23:25:37 Sitting in Church for hours on end, praying n hoping that guy comes to you and tells you abt prosperity in front of ery1. I feel sorry for you pple. Go there and swipe oil n water to keep in your houses while he keeps nothing but Money in His house. Yall lost for real.

291 2018-04-16 23:24:25 2008* if you’re going to repeat a false fact...at least make it consistent with the actual ridiculous narrative that we didn’t we didn’t exist until the oil money came in...which was 2008. 

#oilcunts
292 2018-04-16 23:23:45 Mike...You're logic is to wait until we have a major incident..like the good people of Lac-Mégantic did, thinking that the people that pushed for those rail cars of oil to travel through their town at night, knew what they were doing and had their safety in mind.

299 2018-04-16 23:23:03 Refusal to listen to ALL Canadians has now resulted in an unnecessary proposition on the limitation of oil and energy from two different provinces. Rather than investing in Canadian refineries, the federal government is now creating friction by funding a foreign project. #StopKM
300 2018-04-16 23:22:48 Economically: How will choking off oil company profits go over in their boardrooms? She's proposing cutting off their money; Horgan might lose in court. Cutting off gas to BC is a ridiculous overreaction and the sort I expect from the hyperbolic Kenney, not Ms. Notley 3/
301 2018-04-16 23:22:42 I've bought an apple oil! Just have to wait for shipping. Couldn't find a good one on amazon, so unfortunately it's not 2 day shipping .  I'll have that one up for everyone as soon as I can!

305 2018-04-16 23:21:57 Sorry but we don’t have plenty of oil. There is a bit and it would be good to have a refinery or two.

Bout eucalyptus , the leafs dont do much form me, so im referring to eucalyptus essential oil.
309 2018-04-16 23:21:11 Every energy institute out there thinks oil use will peak in 2030 or so.  Also every other producer is increasing production.   It only takes a 5% bump in supply or a 5% drop demand to knock 50% off the price.  Alberta is very susceptible to shocks compared to other producers.
310 2018-04-16 23:21:01 Coal to oil for strategic reasons.
311 2018-04-16 23:20:43 My mom just texted me to tell me she bought me some sort of essential oil that's supposed to help with night sweats. I will try ANYTHING to make those stop.
312 2018-04-16 23:20:40 How far away are you from an oil tanker carrying 650 000 barrels of oil? That's what we are talking about Blair. You've heard me say this a billion times...this has nothing to do with the pipeline, but rather where you plan to put the oil after that!
313 2018-04-16 23:20:18 I've said from the beginning, that the American people have been conned by a snake oil salesmen who sold people nothing but a bunch of cheap trinkets. Far too many couldn't buy enough.
314 2018-04-16 23:20:11 I shouldn’t have gotten any oil. I’m in class hot

321 2018-04-16 23:19:05 I finally got my oil changed! The mechanics were all impressed with my 350,000 mileage and at how good my engine looked

327 2018-04-16 23:18:23 @RachelNotley @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @jimcarr_wpg @jjhorgan @GeorgeHeyman So, if it is "wrong" for BC to potentially impede Alberta's flow of goods, how is it justifiable for AB to impede the flow of oil to a given province? 1/
328 2018-04-16 23:18:22 Mike, it's about oil tankers and oil spills in the Inlet and you know the Lac-Mégantic rail disaster wasn't an oil spill into the ocean..it was an oil fire in a populated town. Metro Vancouver is much larger than Lac-Mégantic and an oil tanker carries far more oil than rail cars!

354 2018-04-16 23:15:15 Yes. They have been issuing bonds for several hundred years and they have never defaulted. US treasuries are considered the most secure centralized SoV. Also, there is a 0% chance of redeeming oil/cash for Petro because they aren't reedeemable, like Tether.

378 2018-04-16 23:13:09 Raise the speculation tax on those from Alberta?

Just kidding.

But I do hope this kind of situation forces us into a drastic move towards renewable energy sources. If oil is limited, the more our other energy should come renewables. Nothing changes until it has to.
379 2018-04-16 23:13:09 It depends on your skin, it might make you break out...For best results I would use hyaluronic acid and ceramides under argan oil.  hyaluronic acid draws in moisture and plumps out lines and ceramides help repair the moisture barrier

388 2018-04-16 23:12:07 We don't want incidents MIke, close calls or otherwise. BC has absolutely nothing to gain by having Alberta sell oil through our harbor. This is where we live, where we raise our families. It shouldn't be hinged daily on the luck of Captain Peever! ""I've been pretty lucky."
389 2018-04-16 23:12:06 Starbucks coffee tastes like motor oil anyway.

408 2018-04-16 23:10:08 I don't think it will actually be free. But, a lot less expensive than oil. You simply can't justify charging the same price for a resource that is actually limited. So, at least in theory, zero point energy should be a fraction of the price.
409 2018-04-16 23:10:07 Good. Then you'll know that it's not either/or. There are a raft of changes that will eliminate the need for Saudi oil as we transition.
410 2018-04-16 23:09:52 Lac Magnetic is the cautionary tale in favour of pipelines & tankers! Oil in railcars is essentially unregulated. It's treated as any other dangerous good when shipped by rail. In pipelines and on tankers, it's an very specific regulatory environment.

416 2018-04-16 23:09:14 I hope BC goes into hyper drive with solar and EV technology and becomes the leader in renewables that Alberta could have been, effectively rendering this oil pipeline shit obsolete and giving a big f u to those that didn't have the vision and/or guts.

419 2018-04-16 23:08:49 Your party was and is the root cause of this holdup. For decades the NDP has worked to stop the oil sands and pipelines but we should forget that and believe you now. Good luck with that.

421 2018-04-16 23:08:42 I mentioned that because people have this misconception of him as this successful businessman. Growing up here one knows first hand that is complete baloney.  He is a great marketer of himself but is an utter snake oil salesman.
422 2018-04-16 23:08:40 "I've wasted so much of my life stirring olive oil into pasta!"
423 2018-04-16 23:08:34 It isn't crude oil they would want to restrict; it would be refined products like gasoline. Their argument would be that with limited pipeline capacity they need to make more room for more crude oil exports. The impact on BC gasoline prices would be an 'unfortunate' side effect.
424 2018-04-16 23:08:34 They haven't needed our oil (or at least more of our oil) in 10 years.  America has been a net exporter of oil since about 2010.
425 2018-04-16 23:08:19 I suspect ships could be electrified and aircraft could be converted to bio-fuels (algae or plant oil based) in the short run.
426 2018-04-16 23:08:12 I know nothing about cannabis, but am actually looking into picking up some oil to help with my epilepsy (maybe my daughters as well)

431 2018-04-16 23:08:01 Who cares how YOU calculate risk, you don't live down here Blair where the real risk is. There is nothing to gain by selling oil to Asia, except for Alberta and we're measuring that against you trying turn Metro Vancouver into a major oil shipping port. What's your motives Blair?
432 2018-04-16 23:08:00 I do all of that now ,me and the kids are part of the  revolution I just hate relying on dirty saudi oil and believe methane is a better alternative to coal .

436 2018-04-16 23:07:44 Or the pipeline goes to Washington State and the oil goes in tankers in US waters ... but so close it won't make any difference.

442 2018-04-16 23:07:12 That is not a smart strategic solution given our reliance on overseas oil for refining.
We have masses of gas. All our vehicles should be dual fuel running on gas.

I promise u nxt time i sit wth my 70year old Syrian neighbor I’ll convise her that those who torture her 2 sons, bomb her house, rape and kill her daughter were Saudis who wanted to replace patrol with olive oil.
450 2018-04-16 23:06:40 Last night and today a couple times (maybe like 3 sessions altogether) I put some almond oil (coconut oil would probably work too) on it and then took a quarter and kind of scraped it (like you would do on a scratcher) and like rubbed it out lol

459 2018-04-16 23:05:37 What is this "real news network" that you talk of? Who is talking about the lead crisis in America? Where are the journalists IN Syria? Where are the investigations that actually affect America like our bursting pipelines for oil to be exported without us being benefited? Russia!

466 2018-04-16 23:05:05 But Kinder Morgan said oil spills are good for the local economy!
467 2018-04-16 23:05:00 (1) FYI - I support the Kinder-Morgan Pipeline Project.  I believe it can be built safely and operated safely without spills.  Obviously no one wants oil in Canada's West Coast waters.
468 2018-04-16 23:04:57 Because conditioner has oils in it. Takes longer to rinse and longer to dry. It's the oil that conditions your hair.
469 2018-04-16 23:04:57 cannibis oil(not weed) can replace 90% prescription medication.
470 2018-04-16 23:04:56 So wonderful he let BC's premier, John Horgan, push Alberta to the point they're going to turn off the oil and gas taps.
471 2018-04-16 23:04:51 Well, if it ain't about oil or natural gas then the Russian pipelines here in NE are simply decoration?  The ones that travel down (and up) the East? The imminent domain issues are for show? The transport of Russian oil has nothing to do with the Russian tankers docked in Boston?

481 2018-04-16 23:03:49 What about  needs of gas, oil for essential services? There is no way Alberta can cut off all supplies to BC. Imagine an ambulance, First Responder not having the gas to get to an emergency. A bit extreme example but.... Imagine the lawsuits to Alberta if that were to happen.

@AJWVictoriaBC
485 2018-04-16 23:03:33 WRONG. The United States and the rest of the world will NOT stand with Syria. That much has been made clear. Probably because there's not much oil in Syria for the Western nations and arab allies to capitalize on.

I'm pretty sure that the earth needs this "oil" to function properly. We have the technology to do better, but we do not have the leadership.

551 2018-04-16 22:56:36 That’s true of any efforts to reduce fuel oil and coal use. It’s NOT a reason not to reduce emissions. Instead, this is warming to which we’ve committed that has been masked until we remove those emissions.

561 2018-04-16 22:55:23 Might not be a lot of "red license plates" driving to BC this summer - tourism could be hurt badly. Something @jjhorgan @bcndp and @BCGreens need to think about. It ain't just oil. Albertans seem to be mad - and they can withhold their dollars on a personal level too. #bcpoli
562 2018-04-16 22:55:13 We got asked this after the Lely Wisc tour. Straight 19% gluten feed won't "pellet" especially make a "hard" pellet. Will need to add a few other ing in order to go through the dye... something containing some more fat/oil and something gritty. Can still be "high" gluten though.
563 2018-04-16 22:54:58 or tea tree oil
564 2018-04-16 22:54:56 I REALLY hope there's not oil in the moon.
565 2018-04-16 22:54:53 "Only The Strong" by Midnight Oil
566 2018-04-16 22:54:48 As well American taxpayers got the pleasure of paying for ambulance ride, surgery. They aren't cheap. Tens of thousands for an Illegal?
567 2018-04-16 22:54:34 Really pissed there’s no avocado garlic oil left for my salads this week 
568 2018-04-16 22:54:34 Trump Interior Department guts 1918 law that has protected migratory birds for 100 years, The Migratory Bird Treaty Act. This is another big bonus for oil companies, who kill as many as a million birds a year in uncovered oil waste pits alone. A disgraceful legacy
569 2018-04-16 22:54:24 The president is selling snake oil....unfortunately it's his snakes oil and that is no good
570 2018-04-16 22:54:15 Well the chemical attack was perped by Jhon Mcains proxy army aka, Isis, Alqueada, and the Muslim brotherhood in cahoots to overthrow Assad for deep state actors for geopolitical aspirations & a major oil pipeline!! 
571 2018-04-16 22:53:58 but unfortunately less than 20% of palm oil is currently certified as sustainable #PalmOil #deforestation #Orangutans
572 2018-04-16 22:53:54 Day two of getting Kaiyah out. I have done squats, cleaned my house, been on a bumpy car ride, just drank some castor oil mixed with juice, I'm currently bouncing on an exercise ball, gonna take a hot bath after and eat some more pineapple. She better come soon 
573 2018-04-16 22:53:38 Should've been doing that long ago. When Ronald Reagan came in and removed all the solar panels on the White House,  we lost momentum. Now our backs are to the wall. 
Fracking: 5800 cubic feet of natural gas is equivalent to 1 barrel of oil
574 2018-04-16 22:53:34 Fortunately, the IMO is gradually phasing out Bunker fuel. Eventually, that will leave just the crude oil tankers posing the serious environmental threat. Unless of course they are banned from the Salish Sea, or the oil goes overland.
575 2018-04-16 22:53:30 Since you work with the CIA now, please ask around and find out how Handsome Johnny Roselli ended up floating in an oil drum outside of Miami
576 2018-04-16 22:53:29 ive been cooking so much lately that i literally just got hit in the face with hot oil while frying tofu and was not phased at all
577 2018-04-16 22:53:14 How much they best oil cost
578 2018-04-16 22:53:10 The big presupposition here is that 'resources' have to be dirty.  They don't.  20% more resources jobs go to the U.S. solar energy sector than total oil extraction. Alberta and the prairies are perfectly positioned for solar energy and wind resource sector.  Think about it.
579 2018-04-16 22:52:59 Keep hawking that snake oil lol
580 2018-04-16 22:52:46 Warmongers for Oil
581 2018-04-16 22:52:42 Im gonna deep fry you in a giant baste of cooking oil!
582 2018-04-16 22:52:35 OK you’re right... but at some point they got into Texas Oil...West Texas Oil
583 2018-04-16 22:52:33 That and some eastern oil companies own Tankers that ship the international oil to Canada where they distribute! Have you ever heard of the Irving Whale! It sat,occasionally leaking oil at the bottom of the St Lawrence for decades! We had to litigate Irving for compensation!
584 2018-04-16 22:52:32 And oil.
585 2018-04-16 22:52:27 Could be very bad. Plastics can be made from petroleum. So what would happen if the enzyme got into the oil fields?
586 2018-04-16 22:52:24 頑張れ勇人
587 2018-04-16 22:52:14 Illegal alien. Not an immigrant.
588 2018-04-16 22:52:09 Might cash out on this oil change 
589 2018-04-16 22:51:56 Sources attached: His economic policies crashed the Rial against the dollar and led to rocketing inflation (CBI, Finance Min). Billions of dollars in oil revenue went missing (Oil and justice min). A number of his deputies including VP, were jailed for corruption (Justice min).
590 2018-04-16 22:51:52 First Impression: Electric spider spun it's web over head, in plain sight, without fright of occupants, appreciating ability to cast away darkness, by conductive clad wire, answer aids one's desire, at flick of a switch, quantum leap from oil lamp, that could not hold a candle.
591 2018-04-16 22:51:45 Remember when Bill and Jo drove through an exploding oil truck? Remember when they drove through an actual house?! Man. This power couple is on a different level! #twister
592 2018-04-16 22:51:22 From now on I'm only selling oil for BTC, yeah fuck you murica
593 2018-04-16 22:50:51 Guess who has to oil her brows and lashes after getting into bed so comfortable 
594 2018-04-16 22:50:44 They got the missile technology.  They wanna crush the petrodollar.  But they all want including USA higher oil prices..
595 2018-04-16 22:50:15 The chance if an accident involving the 1000s of other ship movements is much higher. So BC should ban all ships with oil in them and quit being hypocrites. And the feds should ban ships off the east coast too.
596 2018-04-16 22:49:56 @chrisaleshire Love it! Thanks for chatting w us. Will you keep us in mind for a car wash or oil change?
597 2018-04-16 22:49:38 @JustinTrudeau Absolute insanity your consideration of using tax payers money to fund an oil pipeline. Do you not think these huge oil firms who rape us at the pumps need more of our money?
598 2018-04-16 22:49:21 Tea tree oil is the best.
599 2018-04-16 22:49:16 I guess I'm not understanding what you're sayibg. Yes oil can be sold for euros or usd?
600 2018-04-16 22:49:11 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
601 2018-04-16 22:49:09 @DonaldJTrumpJr The failing @ApprenticeNBC, Resort Oil for real public of the sun confidence.
602 2018-04-16 22:49:06 So was Federal income tax.
603 2018-04-16 22:48:56 I don't think they'd be allowed to wear their ring attire, just for starters.  It's just sad because the WWE has done an amazing job building up the women's division and then this facepalm because oil money.
604 2018-04-16 22:48:52 Syria has pools of oil.
605 2018-04-16 22:48:31 long story short,'' eat your fish oil'', your sardine and all, they are rich in omega3fattyacids...nsaids have side effects and ocps too
606 2018-04-16 22:48:21 Interesting. Stepping into Oil shorts, Gold shorting either in the 1430-60 range or under 1250, and nearing Dollar buying time soon enough...pretty much an exact opposite stance. All I can say is that I hope he's had those positions for awhile.
607 2018-04-16 22:48:04 #chiringuitocopa que pongan el himno del Sevilla i el del Barça. Y la Copa que se llame como el patrocinador; por ejemplo Copa Nike. O Sabadell. O Santande o Bp oil...etc...el que mas pague, igual que la liga es Santander.
608 2018-04-16 22:47:49 Loving my new soaps. Olive oil and Coconut oil scented with sweet orange essential oil 
609 2018-04-16 22:47:32 jody you are as stupid and pathetic as it gets. AB contributes 15% or less to this country you fool.
Canada has been paying your way for 150 years, everything you have is because of federal money.
Oil depends on subsidies. Tar sands was built on $billions of fed $.

611 2018-04-16 22:47:19 Mike, you're measuring 5 oil tankers a month against 37...that's apples or oranges, my friend. Add in the increasing traffic through the Burrard Inlet from float planes, cargo ships, cruise ships and tourism related craft. Oil tankers carry 650 000 barrels of oil.

614 2018-04-16 22:46:48 I did some reading and went down a couple a rabbit holes to find the real reason behind the Civil War. The North (oil oligarchs/big banker and their bought politicians) hated that the South had no need for their  new oil-dependent machinery because they had slaves working instead
615 2018-04-16 22:46:41 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
616 2018-04-16 22:46:32 also LOL at the way we fetishize the most random singular work tasks like filing taxes or changing your oil or sewing a button back on to be like "omg can't everyone do it?!?!?!?!"
617 2018-04-16 22:46:25 Just to be clear, the motivation for a #war in syria has nothing to do with oil. @HillaryClinton sums it up perfectly: "The best way to help #Israel deal with Iran's growing nuclear capability is to help the people of #Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar #Assad."
618 2018-04-16 22:46:12 I asked my mom what extra virgin olive oil meant and she replied with “it means they’ve never been fvcked” I love her 
619 2018-04-16 22:46:08 Consider yourself lucky @Sledge805 . I got an oil change at my local monroe, it was done wrong, my vehicle was totalled and I'm still paying off the damn balance. 
620 2018-04-16 22:45:52 Yeah, same. I mean, if people want to do that, I can't tell them what to do, but I just strongly recommend it. Imagine not putting fuel/oil in a vehicle. Same effect.
621 2018-04-16 22:45:50 Have you seen the price of oil lately? good for iranian regime
622 2018-04-16 22:45:49 Pasta with oil garlic red pepper flakes and parsley. Taste better then you would think with these simple ingredients
623 2018-04-16 22:45:37 We’re talking about risk. As a general rule, the greater the volume of oil on the water, whether in tankers or as carburant, the greater the risk.
624 2018-04-16 22:45:35 decades of kojima's tomfoolery has left me worried about things like exposure to the bliss oil flowers and shooting @ the faith apparitions
625 2018-04-16 22:45:34 Because Iran and Russia want a oil pipeline through Syria.  And if that is achieved they can destroy the US dollar by uncoupling the petro-dollar.
626 2018-04-16 22:45:30 Looks like AZ will settle for half representation until 2022, or John expires. Amazing
627 2018-04-16 22:45:24 Brent Oil Spot looks like dropping off as well. Definitely a sniff of Bear around again but it's just the early signs.
628 2018-04-16 22:45:10 So im trying this new natural body oil after I shower and this shit is a NO. Shit dried up in like 20 minutes. I think I need to mix it with like a cream or something?
629 2018-04-16 22:45:10 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
630 2018-04-16 22:45:01 @realDonaldTrump son of a bitch you just want the oil
631 2018-04-16 22:44:57 I usually eat them cut up in squares with some salt pepper and olive oil. Cutting them up and baking them as fries is also really good! Honestly, I will even just bake them and take it and just start eating it like it's a banana
632 2018-04-16 22:44:50 Notley has no plan. The GoC has no plan. This is the problem. A spill will happen. it always does. Bitumen does not float like oil, it sinks like a rock. The environmental damage will be huge. This is the problem.
633 2018-04-16 22:44:45 Have you had vegan mayo before? It might change your mind. Man, I will have homemade grapeseed oil vegan mayo on regular sandwich bread as a snack, a meal accompaniment, and it's divine. I despised mayo before, but love it now. Store bought or homemade, it's good.
634 2018-04-16 22:44:43 Need a oil change
635 2018-04-16 22:44:42 I actually use only vitamin C. I also use essential oils. Ever since I had some cinnamon oil mix cure pink eye, I've been sold on that. And Oregano oil helped me get over pneumonia when antibiotics didn't work.
636 2018-04-16 22:44:41 Alberta should ban all workers in the oilsands that are from Quebec that fly in fly out - there's a lot and then ban all Quebec businesses that do busines with the Alberta oil and gas industry
637 2018-04-16 22:44:39 No, they learned the lesson: no matter how reckless they are, we will bail them out and make them even bigger than too big to fail (because we’ve all forgot the lesson of standard oil)
638 2018-04-16 22:44:37 False poll numbers for a fake and false snake oil "president".  Your approval truly hovers around 37%. Loser numbers.
639 2018-04-16 22:44:33 それは羨ましい...

647 2018-04-16 22:43:21 CO2 becomes toxic when atmospheric concentration reaches 10%. It'll knock you out and asphyxiate you. Maybe you should have a chat with the people who take care of the reclamation of old oil abd gas wells. Contaminates a lot of soil and potentially ground water.
648 2018-04-16 22:43:12 起きた！！！！
649 2018-04-16 22:43:04 The change is based on a suggestion by the pain management doctor. Not sure if it will work but giving it a go. Aiming to try CBD oil too but need to do some more research.
650 2018-04-16 22:43:02 Oil is a dinosaur but Justin has to compromise for now. The same for the Middle East policies. It takes a superman to risk the safety of your family to stand up to "The Dark Side".
651 2018-04-16 22:43:00 "Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over." -Psalms 23:5 #Bible
652 2018-04-16 22:42:42 Always wanted a Filipino Stick Fighter in Street Fighter.  Weird we got a Turkish oil wrestler before that. .
653 2018-04-16 22:42:40 You need 60 votes in the Senate sparky. Where is Sanders fully funded bill? Oh wait, he doesn’t want to tell his minions that, in order to get Single Payer, other countries pay a crapload of more taxes. He keeps ignoring that part when selling his snake oil.
654 2018-04-16 22:42:34 We didn't learn from the Iraqi war?
Why are we not bombing Saudi for thier use of chemical weapons on the Yemen population?
Why are we involved in Syria?

OIL.
655 2018-04-16 22:42:27 Good grief. The presence of a secret server by itself would be evidence of intent and convict anyone BUT Hillary Clinton.
656 2018-04-16 22:42:14 The new war with Syria combining with all the others wars that the U.S. is fighting is about oil as well as costing Trillions of dollars but if we would spend it on gas it would be same cost except less killing.
657 2018-04-16 22:42:07 Motsoene oil and gas investment holdings limited( Pty).
658 2018-04-16 22:42:07 And that there would be unconsitutional the same as if BC enacted a law to prevent Aberta's oil reaching the coast. But she knows that and has to play politics just like the lame NDP in BC.

Yay Canada. Not a country just a collection of fiefdoms.
659 2018-04-16 22:42:02 Treasury advised in October 2017 that the cost of no new offshore oil drilling is 6.2 billion dollars. The NZ Govt has chosen to forego that, all for a policy that won't reduce global emissions by one drop.
660 2018-04-16 22:42:00 without my moms essential oil roller i wouldn’t have gotten through that presentation. thx mom
661 2018-04-16 22:41:44 もうすぐ会社めう
662 2018-04-16 22:41:20 I got an oil change and it cost me $2,000 after you reckless monsters totaled my car and left me a balance owed!
663 2018-04-16 22:41:13 Omg how much for the oil slick top? I have bottoms that match. I just haven’t bought a top
664 2018-04-16 22:41:02 also, just burnt the crap out of my stomach with hot oil. severe pain. looks like ill be missing class today. fml
665 2018-04-16 22:40:57 if anyone has free time from 10am - 2pm April 19th please come see my group at Centennial mall talk about oil spills!
666 2018-04-16 22:40:57 And of course we know the oil industry would in fact pay her to say that.

681 2018-04-16 22:39:52 If the govt can give itself the power to restrict the export of oil, why not canola or cattle?

683 2018-04-16 22:39:22 Took my car to get oil change at Walmart. Dipstick wasn't broken when I gave them my car. Got my car and the top part of the dipstick was just thrown on my passenger seat. YOU KNOW I WENT BACK IN SWIFTLY! They tried to tell me that it was broken before. NO SIR!

3/4 Cup heavy cream
1 Cup Parmesan cheese, grated
2 large chicken breasted (I think 1/2 chicken breast per person is enough for this meal, but you could up it if you wanted.)
Olive oil
Salt and pepper
685 2018-04-16 22:39:15 We are acting like napolean, or hitler. Its power hungry and we dont care who have to gas or force into ghettos to establish oil dominance in the region. If we want to stop the pattern of making enemies, and wish for peace, we need to stop asking for war(we need to say NO to it)
686 2018-04-16 22:39:15 Oh i know i just love them lol, coconut oil is soooo good in baked goods

688 2018-04-16 22:38:48 I used to do that...with olive juice. (Not oil, but the salty type.) Just a sip every time, but my mom said I'd ruin my kidneys. (My body was telling me; no, it's wonderful. Bodies know better. )
689 2018-04-16 22:38:48 I got oil in my backyard
690 2018-04-16 22:38:29 NB Article of faith in the oil spill business that even a relatively small spill can have significant consequences, whereas a major one (such as the MV Braer incident in the Shetlands in 1992) can be relatively benign.

694 2018-04-16 22:38:04 Maybe if shoved the oil up his arse?
695 2018-04-16 22:37:50 Thought experiment. What if the AB NDP brought in the same export-barrier legislation, but it was because they wanted to refine it in AB instead of shipping it? Or if they wanted to keep the oil in the ground?
696 2018-04-16 22:37:48 Yes thats the problem.. till the oil drys up of course

698 2018-04-16 22:37:45 hello twitter world, I have discovered the magic of fried and/or roasted chickpeas....WOW !

Tonight’s deliciousness:
chickpeas fried in olive oil with pepper, garlic, cilantro, onions, and a dash of lime juice - tossed in sea salt after cooking 
699 2018-04-16 22:37:42 Kevin Costner*** was the oil spill clean up guy. 

It was me, you, and Jeff Goldblum drinking vanilla Smirnoff and monsters on a party bus en route to the YG concert (Toot It and Boot It YG not gangster YG ppl forget that) at V2O 18&up club in Long Beach
700 2018-04-16 22:37:32 Try shaving with oil instead of shaving cream. Like coconut oil or something. See if it helps :*
701 2018-04-16 22:37:27 Right? She could swallow a lawnmower and make it wish it never was filled with oil, but she is just purring... and let's not give her ideas.
702 2018-04-16 22:37:15 Good thing her name isnt Stormy Starbucks
703 2018-04-16 22:37:10 Cbd isolated helps with a lot of ailments. THC oil vs cancer cells I'd the big one.
704 2018-04-16 22:36:52 yeah I've heard good things about the cleansing oil!! thanks I'll make sure to try them :)
705 2018-04-16 22:36:44 Exactly, Scottish exports including beer, whisky, vodka, oil, dairy, & meat constitute billions of UK£. Tourism adds 11bn approx to that. But the English WM gov will never tell you that because they want all of us to remain ignorant and think that we are worth nothing.

707 2018-04-16 22:36:24 Think I just turned millennial, bought beard oil and a beard brush. I smell like a lumberjack after cutting a pine tree. Shoot me now.
708 2018-04-16 22:36:16 I've done water heaters a couple times, they aren't too bad, unless its oil attached to the boiler. I know we've never really met, but if you need help putting a new one in I'd be willing to help. If not, good luck. Hope you aren't without hot water too long.
709 2018-04-16 22:36:15 I think you need to publish a fan chart showing likely range of oil prices 6, 12 & 24 months out.  Lower end of the range is $1.  Upper end of the range is $1,000.  Estimate oil price will be inside of the fan chart: 95%.
710 2018-04-16 22:36:07 RT @AmandaWawryk:  How would you like to pay $2 for a litre of gas?! That's if you can even find it... @KDnewsguy is talking to an analyst who says that possible if Alberta passes new legislation to limit oil shipments from that province.
711 2018-04-16 22:36:06 The quart of oil in my garage always stays the same price... 
712 2018-04-16 22:35:58 Everyone starts off as Atheist. Theism is indoctrinated from the old to the young. Go back to the null case. No reason to believe every snake oil pitch. Just because your ancestor was swindled and indoctrinated his descendants. Those who do not learn, are doomed to repeat...

716 2018-04-16 22:35:49 You didn't even start.
You think lend lease in exchange for manganese iron and oil meant the Uk did more to win the war than the Soviet Union.

723 2018-04-16 22:34:53 3.  Inevitably, we will use less fossil fuels.  I would like to think that's because people can make good choices but really it's because renewables are getting cheaper.  As that happens, the most expensive oil will cease production.  Guess where that is.
724 2018-04-16 22:34:24 Also olive oil mayo
725 2018-04-16 22:34:16 During House Finance, in response to questions from @TammieKWilson legislative consultant said that raising taxes likely would not be incentivizing more oil down the pipeline. #akleg #policymatters @AKCoalition

727 2018-04-16 22:33:51 Who's in line to add to their fortunes by developing the natural resources (oil & gas) in the Golan Heights IF Israel takes full control?

730 2018-04-16 22:33:41 LUONGO Putin is winning.  US.-backed opposition in Syria is collapsing. Nordstream 2 is going through.  Ukraine will freeze to death.  China buys their oil and gas, invests in their Uranium and oil industries.  He’s winning the diplomatic war in Afg. He’s put Netanyahu on a leash
731 2018-04-16 22:33:39 What planet do you live on Chris???

Assad is about as much of a threat to us as Denmark or Brazil...

The only reason Syria, Iran, & Russia are portrayed as evil is because they want to trade oil in Gold, not USD... /2
732 2018-04-16 22:33:23 Not sure about oil, but “gas” is definitely an issue. The nerve type of gas.
733 2018-04-16 22:33:17 Sis get yourself a good oil cleanser. Of your face is burning from the cleansing stage you’re reacting badly to one of the ingredients.
734 2018-04-16 22:33:04 This is exactly why we are interfering in Syria.CIA went in 7 years ago to oust Assad out..Russia knew if it was successful America would control the Oil what Russia needs.
Russia only helpful to Assad cause of it.
735 2018-04-16 22:32:59 Whoop Whoop!!  Car is on the road and registered til Oct 2019!!  Now 2 back tires and an oil change and I will be set for a while!!  Thank you again to all of you who helped make this possible!!  I am eternally grateful!!
736 2018-04-16 22:32:56 But which one of them is being given the massive bottle of oil...
737 2018-04-16 22:32:26 can you believe bryan came all the way from ohio just to get an oil change with me

739 2018-04-16 22:32:18 Hi, there! Sticking may occur for the first uses. As your stoneware becomes increasingly seasoned, it forms a natural non-stick surface. We suggest lightly oiling with cooking oil (not non-stick spray) as the seasoning develops. Please feel free to DM us with any questions.

FED #GOVT. Continuously wasting OUR money #cdnpoli #BCpoli
741 2018-04-16 22:31:56 KM has never gone longer than 4 years without an oil spill.
742 2018-04-16 22:31:41 290K is the combined amount of oil and salt water. amount of oil alone was about 100 liters.
743 2018-04-16 22:31:37 2. Almost everyone uses something made from or derived from oil.  People who care about future generations try to use less of them and to minimize their impact on the planet.  People who are sociopathic or not too bright fail to make the distinction.
744 2018-04-16 22:31:37 I procrastinate everything that has to do with my car. Oil change? who’s that? burnt out head light that needs fixed? never heard of her. my tags need renewed? i have better things to do. I deserve any consequences that come my way.
745 2018-04-16 22:31:33 @RachelNotley is a bully. Everyone in the lower mainland will go to the States to fill up. Oil and Gas companies in Alberta will lose a fortune. Is she prepared for that?
746 2018-04-16 22:31:14 During the 2017 Election Debates:
Guyon Espiner: "Will you commit to the Green  idea of no new deep-sea oil and gas drilling?"
Labour Party leader Jacinda Ardern: "No"
747 2018-04-16 22:30:59 Conflicting stories all the time Fact is this was already known would happen from 2005...yet nothing has been done..Nico de Jager says ETA is 5pm Tuesday then it's told to us that the damn part must come from Mpumalanga to fix the oil leak...and this is a temporary fix...

751 2018-04-16 22:30:12 I put a dot of tea tree oil + two dots of argon oil mixed together and rub that all over my face every night!
752 2018-04-16 22:30:08 no coconut oil is not good for skin dkflsdjflksjd it actually clogs your pores. I recommend a vitamin C serum! it really helped my acne scars
753 2018-04-16 22:30:08 Do it #Alberta I wonder if it would be legal for Alberta to do so(I’m serious & not be facetious).
I’d be happy w/ Alberta turning off the taps, simply for BC to say theyre not accepting any Alberta oil & to never allow oil to flow through BC again. Wonder how they’d take that
754 2018-04-16 22:29:56 I just wanna say I was VERY sick these past few days. It got progressively worse and yesterday was horrible. I anointed myself with oil and declared healing and I just realized that every symptom is gone. Like I didn’t even realize I woke up and went through this whole day well.
755 2018-04-16 22:29:51 Try cooking pancakes with olive oil instead of butter. Yum

760 2018-04-16 22:29:35 How would you like to pay $2 for a litre of gas?! That's if you can even find it... @KDnewsguy is talking to an analyst who says that possible if Alberta passes new legislation to limit oil shipments from that province. More on @NEWS1130
761 2018-04-16 22:29:26 Yes, you are absolutely right. So drive to boarder and fill up your tank plz. If your pay grade is $20 an hour and add that to your bill. Or waiting for numourous tanker and oil truck come to BC which carring a cost too. Lol.
762 2018-04-16 22:29:19 I made flat bread today, put some olive oil and zaatar on it. Yum!
763 2018-04-16 22:29:14 I only use their rice water bright cleansing oil for makeup and it's amazing. They have a set with the foam cleanser and both works wonder for makeup and general cleansing.
764 2018-04-16 22:29:06 BC should want this though.  It means less oil and gas flowing through pipelines in their province, which is supposedly why they want the Trans Mountain Pipeline stopped.
765 2018-04-16 22:28:56 Why don't you change your own oil and how could it possibly take more than 15 minutes?
766 2018-04-16 22:28:42 Have you tried tea tree oil? Best thing ever. Only for spot acne, never put it all over your face.
767 2018-04-16 22:28:36 So you want to continue betting entirely on the oil basket? So what happens when a larger more easily accessed reserve is found? Alberta will go down the shitter just like they did in 2015 when the saudi's and other middle eastern producers started producing again.
768 2018-04-16 22:28:32 There is as much proof about the Saudis in Yemen and the Israelis in Gaza as there is about Assad in Syria. Fighting proxy wars over oil pipelines is really what this is all about.
769 2018-04-16 22:28:15 Any idea how soon a post oil  world is remotely likely?
Anyone.

774 2018-04-16 22:27:02 I mean we could be if we keep expanding oil production. I do understand the polution in Asia, it is absolutely horrendous. The thing is I protest and voice my oppinion to my government, if I write a letter to a Chinese official it has no weight.

778 2018-04-16 22:26:01 Been saying for a while that no pipelines in Canada makes US oil happy. Not surprised to see this but glad someone is following the money. The big nay sayers aren’t concerned with the environment just their bank accounts.

End of.

788 2018-04-16 22:24:16 & that box be slippery like tryna walk on oil
789 2018-04-16 22:24:16 It has nothing to do with innocents losing their lives.  It’s all about an oil pipeline. But you knew that already, didn’t you.
790 2018-04-16 22:24:11 Unlikely to happen very often (and it wan't an oil tanker - Natural-gas condensate)

And unescorted.
791 2018-04-16 22:24:06 Settle down olive oil! Lmao
792 2018-04-16 22:24:03 It would be crazy if frying things wasn't based on oil being a certain temperature, but rather it was due to temperature differentials. Like room temp chicken fried in hot oil, but frozen chicken fried in room temperature oil. That would be so weird
793 2018-04-16 22:23:59 Yeah, that beats me! still think their next poll will be dismal, after he sold out Taranaki and NZ re the oil and gas exploration ban!! Amazes me though.
794 2018-04-16 22:23:39 @theresa_may get a plane pick up a gun and fight in Syria. No one wants to fight your fucking war for oil everyone wants peace what the fuck is up with you !! The time will come when the people of earth become woke! #woke
795 2018-04-16 22:23:34 And they HAVEN'T stopped deep sea oil drilling, dingbat! 

How many drilling operations have been closed down? Zero, that's how many. Those exploration permits run till 2030, and the drilling can carry on for many years after that. You must know this. Stop trolling.
796 2018-04-16 22:23:30 Yes, since there doesn't appear to be any consensus, nor any attempt to achieve one, Trudeau will go down as the leader who had good looks and talked the talk, but he will NOT be remembered for walking the walk or being anything more than a "yessir" to oil.

804 2018-04-16 22:22:29 By trying to kill the project the environmentalists are siding with trump over their own country. Getting oil to tide water helps CDN’s, shipping exclusively to the USA benefits Americans.

807 2018-04-16 22:22:17 Destroying the country is her job.
808 2018-04-16 22:22:15 The whole premise is Libtarded. He isn’t compromised by Russia. Just because Dora is worried doesn’t make it so.
809 2018-04-16 22:21:44 I was thinking that but I didn't know for sure. I remember 1 company was caught & filmed dumping their rubbish bins overboard so what else are they doing? Do they use palm oil to cook with do you know?
810 2018-04-16 22:21:42 @RachelNotley keep your dirty oil you hag
811 2018-04-16 22:21:41 So much oil has been found in  Syria that’s why #America trying to go to war. They just tryna take BILLIONS of barrels of oil
812 2018-04-16 22:21:33 And in parallel, the DOEd should stop giving any taxpayer $$ to support ‘academic disciplines’ who’s very reason for existence seems to be the destruction of America. (Plus, the wailing & gnashing of teeth would be EPIC!)
813 2018-04-16 22:21:23 We'd have an easier go pivoting from oil as energy than getting away from plastic use imo. But probably longterm there are additives to prevent this. Short term wild release sounds interesting....
814 2018-04-16 22:21:07 Any sane person & those that  know what the NDP stands for, one of which is keeping the oil in the ground, you knew this was going to happen. Her acting and pretending that she wanted the pipeline built was just that, acting & pretending.

823 2018-04-16 22:20:06 There is more scientific consensus about climate change than there is about penicillin. I'm not sure what it takes to be considered settled science but everyone from the oil companies to the scientists to the religious institutions is on board. Everyone except FOX news, really.
824 2018-04-16 22:19:46 don't blaze up this week guys.

instead just burn up the midnight oil.

839 2018-04-16 22:17:36 You never know where the next marine oil spill is going to come from. That’s why we need a very robust marine safety regime, not just here along the BC coast but anywhere.

841 2018-04-16 22:16:48 It's not about stoping the oil we already use (obviously less is better) it's about not using what isn't neccesary.

848 2018-04-16 22:16:23 Yes, & also oil. Straight into Mediterranean without having to use Gulf, Arabian sea, Red sea, Suez. Without having to use Turkey.
849 2018-04-16 22:16:20 I had no idea that when a oil spill occurs - the clean-up crew faces long-term health hazards too - no amount of $$ can return persons health back- hope a Judge sees the implications too
850 2018-04-16 22:15:54 I must send you some Young Living peppermint oil to place on your temples for headaches. Very good quality.  So sorry you had one on your first day off.  No fun!!

856 2018-04-16 22:15:09 There is no justification for doing this, other than greed. Increasing production in the oil patch so we can force BC to accept these tankers each and every day in our waters and transforming Burrard Inlet into a port of oil tankers, incidents, fire risk, and spill risk.
857 2018-04-16 22:14:55 Came here to say nasty things to big oil but the lovely people already did it. Thanks all!

873 2018-04-16 22:12:56 Thanks to all those #TransMountain supporters for taking the time to enquire about the risks of marine oil spills along the BC coast, and for being polite (for the most part). I’ve enjoyed it. Let’s hope I never have to lead a major response operation, as I am trained to do.
874 2018-04-16 22:12:46 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
875 2018-04-16 22:12:19 Next you can write in-depth about the political fear-mongering and how big oil has masterfully leveraged a PR campaign to further their interests and raid the Canadian taxpayers pockets. Should be super easy.
876 2018-04-16 22:11:56 Shut the gas and oil of to Quebec
877 2018-04-16 22:11:24 Indeed. I myself am a hybrid kinda girl. And ever since I have been able to safe about $400 on medication cost per month. No more side effects either. But don't quote me on that; I am a nobody.

884 2018-04-16 22:10:48 My mom swears by CBD oils I honestly don’t see no difference at all the couple times I’ve tried it. I make an sell bath bombs. Trying to come up with a recipe to use the cbd oil in them. But will see how they turn out.
885 2018-04-16 22:10:45 Something that has helped me is lots of hydration. CeraVe hydrating cleanser works well for me and so has cosrx snail 96 mucin power essence. BUT everyone is different. I have heard using rose hip oil in your routine  helps too I was wanting to try it.

890 2018-04-16 22:10:19 All that may be true, but my point is that for decades Alberta Conservatives did nothing to boost province's ability to add value to its oil so tday the only option is to export unrefined discounted oil. @jkenney @ElizabethMay

896 2018-04-16 22:09:54 We’ve been over this before Mike, increasing tanker traffic out of Westridge by 7 times for starters from what it is now turns Metro Vancouver into a major oil shipping port and creates risk in the Burrard Inlet from greatly increasing this hazardous activity.

969 2018-04-16 22:02:18 My hubby loves to lotion my legs.. god only knows what he would do with this oil.. might be a fetish ;) @sgarrett83112   < my bestie
970 2018-04-16 22:02:10 If the oil companies are shipping the oil to Texas at half price then selling it to the world at full price why would they really want a pipeline
971 2018-04-16 22:02:06 Aves Thompson with the Alaska Truckers Association: We oppose House Bill 288. Investment is up, and oil production stable, even in this low price environment. HB 288 will take Alaska backward, and do nothing to improve job opportunities. #akleg

973 2018-04-16 22:02:02 People just being assholes when you work in the oil field and firing you for being mad that you had a 21 hour shift.
974 2018-04-16 22:01:58 That means transitioning now. That means leaving oil in the ground now. Not entrenching billions of dollars in an industry we are walking away from. The future generations will ask why we continued to pour billions into infrastructure we know was contradictory to our goals.
975 2018-04-16 22:01:54 #2billion could go towards just transition for oil workers incl. necessary skills training/redevelopment and enhanced EI!
976 2018-04-16 22:01:53 Elon rocks. We should be subsidizing electric vehicles the way we subsidize oil.

979 2018-04-16 22:01:29 My only question is why is the price of gas going up when the price of crude oil is going down?
980 2018-04-16 22:01:08 Hey buddy what's up
I got best grade medical marijuana buds, concentrate,shatter and some good cannabis CBD oil for patients and smokers was wondering if you will like to try some of my products..

996 2018-04-16 21:59:47 Expensive custom parts did them all in, plus difficult evacuation procedures. Hershey also couldn’t run such a hydraulic-based ride in the Winter for the Christmas event (they heat up the oil on some of the smaller rides, like the pirate ship).

998 2018-04-16 21:59:37 Sameeee XD so far the only thing sorta working is constantly moisturizing my hands so when I go to pick I feel the oil and it makes me realize I’m picking 
999 2018-04-16 21:59:35 Russia delivered shit so far ,irgc is resourceful to stand alone      What planet u live on ?  

  All Iran best weapons from China +NK , largest weapon contract was in 2000s before Putin 

Im agree whit the Saudi Iran war , saudi oil needs to be burned down 
1000 2018-04-16 21:59:24 Alberta’s present legislation to limit or cut oil supply for BC can also shut off or limit the supply of oil to Quebec to reopen the discussion on the east west pipeline to the maritimes
1001 2018-04-16 21:59:19 and 1-2 drops of teatree oil in that mixture if you get an infection, same thing its just an amazing natural anti-bac (dont use too much though because it can irritate!!!)
1002 2018-04-16 21:59:06 Idk her husband is a puppet for oil pipeline in Syria.
1003 2018-04-16 21:59:02 Olive oil, real garlic, real onions in the pan. Season the food with natural herbs, cayenne pepper, and if I want more spice real peppers

1010 2018-04-16 21:58:17 From interviewing an Iranian engineering professional, I learned that the most common engineering fields pursued by students are chemical, electrical, petroleum, and civil. This is because of the oil and gas resources in Iran. Engineering revolves around the industry. @vtrsap
1011 2018-04-16 21:58:16 I know my job was so pissed that we had tech issues today. I love working from home. I used that time to wash, deep condition, and do an oil treatment to my hair. 

Perfect.
1012 2018-04-16 21:58:12 fuck no . im just finna get my oil changed & dont wanna pay 
1013 2018-04-16 21:58:06 I want it to making me look like i just drank a bunch of vegetable oil
1014 2018-04-16 21:58:06 Is not simple as you say and business is cover different sector from Coca Cola manufacturing to oil and refinery 
1015 2018-04-16 21:58:01 The indigenous leaders have not given consent for the pipeline to go through their territory. Who is breaking the law? If our government wants to go to war with them and environmentalists and canadians who do not see this in "national interest" for a texas oil company? Good luck.
1016 2018-04-16 21:57:58 Soaking in ACV & coconut oil epsome salt...really not in the mood for company or leaving the house 
1017 2018-04-16 21:57:53 David Khan are you seriously saying that Alberta & Canada should allow BC to disregard the Rule of Law & cost Alberta Billions. It appears your attempting to protect relatives in BC from possible huge Oil & Gasoline increases when we Real Albertan’s slow down pipeline oil. 
1018 2018-04-16 21:57:51 We'll not letting OIL flow is a political correct and a UN way of moving the west in to a globalist one world agenda and so there for the establishment are usefull idiots,they dont care if there are job lost  thatway they get to dictate sooner.

1027 2018-04-16 21:55:38 Also, if #kindermorgan ,a company with some expertise investing in oil projects, thinks that it is not a viable project, maybe that should give Notley and Trudeau some pause before wasting public treasure. #abpoli #cdnpoli
1028 2018-04-16 21:55:38 25 years or so. It’s always worked pretty well, just sometimes not as good as oil or copper.
1029 2018-04-16 21:55:11 That's what happens when your North Sea oil disappears. Like coal before it, fossil fuels are a finite and non-renewable resource.  Time to figure out a replacement.

1033 2018-04-16 21:54:59 Latest volley in pipeline politics.  Alberta Government tables bill that could restrict exports of gas, crude oil and refined fuels from Alberta.  If passed, could lead to spike of prices at BC pumps.  @CTVNewsVI
1034 2018-04-16 21:54:57 More jobs are in solar and wind than in fossil fuels! Steyer’s policies would be a BLESSING for American jobs AND reduce oil spills and fracking-caused earthquakes! Let’s love God’s creation, not DESTROY it!
1035 2018-04-16 21:54:52 Nunda for tractor trailer roll over with 6500 gallons motor oil tank is leaking
1036 2018-04-16 21:54:45 There is not one barrel of oil more that should be extracted anywhere, especially #TarSands - you've chosen your path, you could have chosen other paths.. your choices will be held to account by those of us in the world who want a planet to live on and breath on.
1037 2018-04-16 21:54:40 They have a point. There will be more oil tankers in B. C ports then any other. Will be dangerous.
1038 2018-04-16 21:54:19 Nobody hates you Alex, you are great at performance artist, the world's greatest Conspiracy Theorist, no one can take that away from you.

1040 2018-04-16 21:54:11 @septemberrbloom Happens at times! Did you end up getting your car oil changed?
1041 2018-04-16 21:53:59 Morally F'in wrong to mess with a soverign state just for oil & gas reserves, especially when you flood your country with fighting aged men from these parts of the world & put your country at risk ...Again....

1043 2018-04-16 21:53:52 You try being your mechanic, and being so tired from working on automail that you mistake your oil for your coffee.
1044 2018-04-16 21:53:50 Yes yes..oil is behind everything.
1045 2018-04-16 21:53:48 No, your proposal risks the health and well being of all the people living along the route of these oil tankers from Westridge Marine Terminal, reminding you that Metro Vancouver is one of the most densely populated cities in North America

1047 2018-04-16 21:53:42 It’s before 5 o’clock... I’m home from work and got an oil change on my way home. Life is good 
1048 2018-04-16 21:53:29 I survived the #Awkward #SmallTalk getting my haircut and my car's oil change! Please just cut my hair and put oil in my car with minimal interaction. I don't want to explain what an #Actuary is one more time, and, yes, it is definitely terrible #Weather outside...
1049 2018-04-16 21:53:29 Part of the left strategy. Bleeding resources while government, Me and You, foot the bill to destroy the man we elected.
1050 2018-04-16 21:53:07 During the elections: Guyan: will you be supporting the Greens policy to  stop deep sea oil and gas drilling? Jacinda: No ???

1053 2018-04-16 21:52:33 It would make sense (not pressurized), but they got cold feet about shipping crude oil by train & going through towns, after Lac Mégantic's catastrophe. That said, they were using very old cars then, not the newer ones, which have more protection against spill & explosion.
1054 2018-04-16 21:52:30 Why does it take so fucking long for Acura to change my oil and filter
1055 2018-04-16 21:52:17 Haha so I came to get an oil change .. and the guy comes in with a soft tone and says “sweetie, how many miles did you go over from doing an oil change”  right there I knew I messed up
1056 2018-04-16 21:52:17 How many US oil tankers traverse those waters to the US side of the border currently, vs CDN oil tankers?
1057 2018-04-16 21:52:06 OK... Getting one beard oil for you 
1058 2018-04-16 21:52:02 I heard using his beard oil gets you stoned for 24 hrs

passage to the West 
for Putin and all his 
oil/gas lines. 
#SYRIANA

(And Putin is testing Russia's chemical weapons on Syrians [for future] in exchange for protection.)

Side note: Iran will have missles on Syria's southern border pointed at Israel shortly.
1060 2018-04-16 21:51:32 It's a proven fact that in this world, it's a curse to have natural riches - oil, minerals etc. We have a bellicose bully imposing itself all over the world. Bulldozing countries & people, & helping itself to their riches - through the barrel of a drone.
1061 2018-04-16 21:51:31 @FirestoneAuto glad that I can walk into one of your repair centers needing a tire repair only to be told that they can only do oil changes tonight.

1064 2018-04-16 21:51:14 got disgusted changing the oil & left
1065 2018-04-16 21:51:09 The EU said we would have to re-apply to get in-Westminster said we would not be ALLOWED back in.

The SNP lied about the oil?? What planet are you on? Have you SEEN the latest figures for oil surveys !? (But you're talking about oil cost? Aye, *that* was the problem. (sigh))

1069 2018-04-16 21:50:44 What is the definition of "Major Oil Spill"?  1, 10 or 1,000 bbl's?
1070 2018-04-16 21:50:43 I knew she drank the oil-
1071 2018-04-16 21:50:38 So the repeated talks about bombing countries, taking the oil, and intentionally killing civilians was what?

1074 2018-04-16 21:49:46 Get your wallet out folks.  "E" means EXPENSIVE!
Squeezing the taps.  Alberta introduces legislation to limit fuel flow to B.C.   Saskatchewan says similar legislation is coming there.   
Moral of the story:  If B.C. doesn't want Alberta oil...B.C. doesn't want their gas.

1077 2018-04-16 21:49:19 Let's go back to that last segment. Oil. Oil, oil, oil. It's that thing you don't talk about. Did I mention oil? It's all about oil. #MTPDaily #msnbc
1078 2018-04-16 21:49:17 Burning wood pellets is NOT zero carbon, Neither is solar, or wind, or anything else for that matter. What it is, is lower carbon than COAL or OIL.  No, not (probably) as low as Solar or wind (the real numbers are fiercely complex to work out btw), but BETTER THAN COAL!!

1081 2018-04-16 21:49:04 I'm not on HRT or out yet, but I've been slowly growing my hoard in secret and using mineral oil on my skin – I mean scales... – in preparation.
1082 2018-04-16 21:49:04 And if they lose then BC will pass a law restricting the flow of oil into their province.
1083 2018-04-16 21:48:59 Now up in #akleg's House Resources: public testimony on House Bill 288, one of the various oil tax bills being debated in Juneau. Peter Morgan from Palmer: I oppose this bill. I work in construction, and this bill will make the economy worse.
1084 2018-04-16 21:48:48 Ive discovered that facial oil really helps with acne! I got some at TJ Max for like $15 and it not only smooths my skin but I haven’t broken out since I started using it!
1085 2018-04-16 21:48:44 Because it is being done entirely st our expense, risking jobs in BC’s Touridm Industry, equally represented by both men and women, unlike the oil patch the only place where economic gain for #KM is realized.
1086 2018-04-16 21:48:38 I wonder: where are the protesters at YVR protesting this massive fuel and oil use on a daily basis ?? Where are the protests of all freight ships, #SeaBus or #BCFerries with their diesel engines. Or that of school or public transit buses ?
1087 2018-04-16 21:48:27 Checking oil in truck, dropped on way into auto store
1088 2018-04-16 21:48:16 Even with the oil contaminated polymer? What could you recycle it into?

1092 2018-04-16 21:48:03 @neilmlomax how many names did Spizz have? Spizz Oil. Athletico Spizz Oil , Spizz Energi - can’t remember the others!!!
1093 2018-04-16 21:47:51 Oregano tea is supposed to be amazing for cramps! Or a couple of drops of oregano oil in your favorite warm tea or apply over your lower belly where it hurts 
1094 2018-04-16 21:47:48 They just found a shit load of oil in Syria, now I see why we bombed then 
1095 2018-04-16 21:47:45 I’d say use baby oil or vasaline but you’d prolly have an allergic reaction
1096 2018-04-16 21:47:41 There have been many brutal dictators. Just not all of them sitting on fields of oil. Do you support refugees coming here?
1097 2018-04-16 21:47:33 If Alberta can pass a law restricting the flow of oil OUT of their province then why can't BC pass a law restricting the flow of oil INTO their province?
1098 2018-04-16 21:47:29 This time she just called her and the first thing she did was laughed. "You're obviously not very good if you lost darling." She hummed and went to grab her flour but ended up slipping on a little oil she'd spilled without noticing. 

A squeak sounded and soon followed a thud.
1099 2018-04-16 21:47:23 Ah Laura, thank you, you're an inspiration.  And thanks for reminding me to take my cod liver oil on the off chance it miraculously cures my clinical depression 
1100 2018-04-16 21:47:12 Free market guy,  I get it. BUT,  the fact I pay these ppl to abuse positions, Constitution, rule of law to enrich themselves,  they skate?
1101 2018-04-16 21:47:04 The people that complain that Brownwood smells like dog food, are the same people that ask why Odessa/Midland smells like oil.
1102 2018-04-16 21:46:53 Be the change no more using oil money to win leagues where's Financial Fair play
1103 2018-04-16 21:46:50 The same France that just aided in an illegal attack on Syria? Also climate change and oil extraction are polar opposites just saying
1104 2018-04-16 21:46:40 I think I can see 7 oil rigs from this great. That's not something you'd see at home
1105 2018-04-16 21:46:32 Watching my man make dinner, and he reads “add two teaspoons of olive oil to the pan” and he literally gets out a teaspoon.  I don’t know anyone who actually measures olive oil for a pan. Omg I love him.
1106 2018-04-16 21:46:31 Fire department have come to my house on top this frying palm oil thing
1107 2018-04-16 21:46:12 Please, entertainer gonna entertain not enlighten. Hannity is making money like a carnival barker or snake oil salesman. The rubes love him, his BS, and thinks he has the same values. Truth cuts the bottom line e.g. Laura I.
1108 2018-04-16 21:46:08 @CanadianPM  can you provide any evidence that selling oil to China at the risk of the Pacific coast is the best action for Canada? $ for foreign business over our environment?
1109 2018-04-16 21:46:07 Serious question for you & @CPC_HQ  Did you consider it appropriate to extend a wide range of subsidies, along with repeal of environmental protections, to the oil industry?
Secondly, what about the multinationals that have divested #tarsands properties BEFORE #StopKM arose?
1110 2018-04-16 21:46:03 Idk what kind of oil this girl put on my cuticles but it smells like weed and I can't with it 
1111 2018-04-16 21:46:01 I also mix my essential oils with a base oil when I'm using it for massage! The little bit of lavender oil that I dab on my wrists and behind my ears is such a small amount – – I don't mix it with a base oil!
1112 2018-04-16 21:45:52 Coconut oil good outside and inside 
1113 2018-04-16 21:45:51 Similarly, Norway has 100% renewable energy, because they've been able to use profits from oil and gas to finance a transition to renewable domestic electricity generation.
1114 2018-04-16 21:45:48 Oil tankers coming anyway.  West coast has had and will continue to be a heavily populated area on the supertanker highway from Alaska to processors on the west coast
1115 2018-04-16 21:45:45 I’m guna moisturise it with caster oil and she’s butter after! After 1 year since the big chop, I’m finally able to manage my natural hair 
1116 2018-04-16 21:45:43 The point is not about political narrative.
Its about oil
Its about natural resources 
Its about money
Its about profits
Its about homicidal egoic urges

Its about everything thats not being reported by the mainstream.
People are not crazy to not want another war love.
1117 2018-04-16 21:45:43 haha #MalluHair I used a combination of fractured coconut oil and vaseline  cc: @abishmathew
1118 2018-04-16 21:45:30 This is not about money, it’s got to be something deeper than that, something with more value than money, something that can’t be bought, it has to be instilled. Something like ideology. It isn’t about money or oil.
1119 2018-04-16 21:45:27 an hour wait for an oil change huh. guess it’s time to stare at Twitter!
1120 2018-04-16 21:45:26 I googled "stovetop granola," read the first 5-6 recipes, and concluded that the actual amount of oats / nuts / honey do not matter at all, it's to taste. So I recommend a little coconut oil in the pan, as much oats / nuts / berries / seeds as you like, and several Tbsp honey.
1121 2018-04-16 21:45:16 @jjhorgan @bcndp @CanadianGreens if your so worried about tanker spills in the waterways why are you still taking Saudi oil in? One rule for Alberta another for blood oil @JustinTrudeau @liberal_party @UCPCaucus @CPC_HQ they are utter hypocrites #TrudeauMustGo #trudeaufortreason
1122 2018-04-16 21:45:15 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
1123 2018-04-16 21:45:14 I love Olive oil on warm bread 
1124 2018-04-16 21:45:02 I don’t oil mine. I just shampoo and call it a day.
1125 2018-04-16 21:44:54 Freshly shaven legs, covered in coconut oil & fresh bedding. That is all 
1126 2018-04-16 21:44:41 Coconut oil, argan oil or Moroccan oil 
1127 2018-04-16 21:44:36 Alberta today introduced legislation to ban oil exports to BC if needed I am wondering if @PremierScottMoe will follow suit sometimes you need use a stick to prove a point

1128 2018-04-16 21:44:34 Ultimately you're right. We'd rather not build them but the alternative are all these monsters getting back into power and the oil and gas sector having all the tape cut for them.
1129 2018-04-16 21:44:33 Dirty pizza is at 3-4am after a big night out at one of those 24/7 joints where you buy it by the slice and the oil comes almost as a condiment 
1130 2018-04-16 21:44:31 When Tuscaloosa Ford can’t change my oil in less than 2hours so I have driven 30 minutes for nothing! If I arrive at 4:30 and you’re open till 6, ima call BS!!!!  #waybetterwhentheywereTownsendFord #TuscaloosaFordiscrap
1131 2018-04-16 21:44:12 funny but I would  guess you are not making calls to your oil and gas buddies trying to figure out how to fleece America of their national parks and destroying the environment
1132 2018-04-16 21:44:10 If #AB cuts off oil to #BritishColumbia then tourist should boycott #Alberta & go to #BC instead. #boycottAB
1133 2018-04-16 21:44:10 Almond, argan, olive oil
1134 2018-04-16 21:44:08 So, what's your point? It's only $43k!  Nothing special for this special Secretary!  This time, the Oil Companies will pay for it!   Right????

1137 2018-04-16 21:44:04 And the biggest risk of 14 more oil storage tanks on top of existing 12 on Burnaby Mountain is IMMEDIATE FIRE DANGER to 10000s of North Burnaby residents, students, staff, and volunteers @SFU. Perhaps Brent needs some reading comprehension
1138 2018-04-16 21:44:03 Now BC can buy foreign oil like eastern Canada does!  Bullying BC will have long term repercussions! Albertans have forgotten how Justin's father screwed Alberta!

1150 2018-04-16 21:41:23 AB introduces new legislation giving it the power to restrict the export of natural gas & crude oil across its borders. @RachelNotely-- "We did not start this fight but let there be no doubt we will do whatever it takes to build this pipeline." I think she means you,#BC.
1151 2018-04-16 21:41:10 Gonna keep banging that CBD oil drum. Did you give it a try yet?
1152 2018-04-16 21:41:01 I've said this many times, in no other professional Corp other than the Edm Oil is this level and duration of ineptitude tolerated. Even  in Haiti and Chad, shareholders would revolt, everyone fired.
1153 2018-04-16 21:40:56 Our dollar is based on our ability to export our oil. Train spills have killed whole rivers and even blown up a Quebec town. Pipeline gives us Asian markets!! Jag, ur just another copy of a copy of a copy.
1154 2018-04-16 21:40:47 The World is moving towards renewable energy,US is the worlds biggest Oil producer, the largest bomb is useless if the missile or plane delivering is going to be shot down as soon as it's launched+no proof S400 or S500 is better than THAAD..stop living in Fantasia
1155 2018-04-16 21:40:33 Oil prices dropped on Monday as investor concern waned about  escalating tensions in the Middle East following air strikes on Syria  over the weekend.

1159 2018-04-16 21:40:15 Endless oil story
1160 2018-04-16 21:40:10 It’ll be good for at least another century though. Energy mix today is 2/3 comprised of coal, gas or oil. That will not be changed in a decade or 3. Maybe 10-15. Ever wondered why flights to Europe or Mexico are so cheap today relative to wages vs say 1980s? Not because of solar.
1161 2018-04-16 21:39:52 Not the 14 new oil tanks that will come if KM can ram the new pipeline. A major difference between 12 and 26 oil tanks on the south side of Burnaby Mountain. And 10000s residents around Burnaby Mountain and up to 30000 students, staff, and volunteers @SFU have to bear that risk
1162 2018-04-16 21:39:44 coconut oil and aloe vera :)
1163 2018-04-16 21:39:42 Rewind to Friday 13th at say 3.45 pm and Nostrodamus sends me a message from his grave saying that @realDonaldTrump , Macron & UK are going to bomb Syria at 10.30 tomorrow. Knowing Putin's threats I would have shorted Indices, OZ$ & bought gold and Oil.
Yeah, great trades..not.

1175 2018-04-16 21:38:41 Oil companies will tell the Alberta government not to restrict the flow because it will cut into their profits
1176 2018-04-16 21:38:31 Yes all the time i only use oil of just leave in conditioner to refresh or pull my hair back

1189 2018-04-16 21:37:15 @ShepNewsTeam laughingstock of @FoxNews 
This pic says it all. 
1190 2018-04-16 21:37:12 If oil was sold in other currencies you wouldn’t be long finding out what the dollar is really worth! It’s not acceptable that we have to pay extra to prop up your currency!
1191 2018-04-16 21:37:11 Looks 2 stone overweight and has the turning circle of an oil tanker, really such a shame as he was one of the best I’d seen pre injury albeit playing in a formation and style that suited his game far more than Rowett’s cautious men behind the ball style
1192 2018-04-16 21:37:06 Your #MCM doesn’t know how to change his oil
1193 2018-04-16 21:36:54 Sometimes the items are not available to be delivered in one package on the same day, so they get spread out and then sometimes you just forget to order something else. Like I forgot to order a wrench and an oil filter, so went back online.
1194 2018-04-16 21:36:42 Yes, even last week I remember he called the build too
1195 2018-04-16 21:36:41 Rose oil just a dream
1196 2018-04-16 21:36:34 i didn't go change my oil until a maintenance light popped up~
1197 2018-04-16 21:36:19 BTW: Love the quote and thank you for sharing.  Might there be oil in dem Syrian fields? Israel knows as do all the investors.
Shows the hypocrisy of this admin. DT claims to care so much about children but separates them from their immigrant parents.

1199 2018-04-16 21:36:09 Palm oil
1200 2018-04-16 21:36:03 Co-sign. Always sear, never bake. I keep it super simple: olive oil, flaky salt, black pepper, two chopped garlic cloves. *chef kiss*
1201 2018-04-16 21:36:03 Don't waste yr time. Oil schill.
1202 2018-04-16 21:35:50 If Trudeau puts money into it, he will try to determine when, who, what and the volumes of the shipments of oil, and Canada doesn't need that.
1203 2018-04-16 21:35:48 Are you extending your ban on palm oil based products to include foods that contain palm kernel / palm oil derivatives such as glycerine, stearic acid, MCT oil and Fatty Esters to name just a few? Or do you ensure that they are sources via mass balance (RSPO) certified avenues?
1204 2018-04-16 21:35:46 Not for ME !!
Our guy is "OWNED" by MARATHON OIL and a few others!
1205 2018-04-16 21:35:43 I'm sure it's all about oil noting else.
1206 2018-04-16 21:35:35 During a time period when North America is  disrupting the oil market because we're producing too much. Genius.
1207 2018-04-16 21:35:35 these people are heroes. BC stands with them & for Indigenous rights & Canadians' rights to a clean/sustainable future. foreign oil interests don't run our province & never will. alberta could learn a thing or two from a province w/backbone which doesn't bend over for bigoil
1208 2018-04-16 21:35:30 2.time in 24hs that I dropped the mint oil bottle and of course it spilled all over again.very refreshing smell in my flat
1209 2018-04-16 21:35:24 Grest! BC can buy foreign oil like eastern Canada does!  Bullying! Albertans have forgotten how Justin's father screwed Alberta!
1210 2018-04-16 21:35:20 @RachelNotley bring it on BC will only dig our heels deeper to prevent your oil from potentially damaging our coast and water ways @JustinTrudeau @jjhorgan

1214 2018-04-16 21:34:48 If we have to use oil, the pipeline is the safest way to go, so get on with it.
1215 2018-04-16 21:34:39 Do make sure oil spills will not happen but what real proposals do you offer? Are you about to ban ALL oil use in BC?  No oil co. can survive producing
 oil just  for half of Canada.
1216 2018-04-16 21:34:38 Syria’s in an oil rich region so we’ll bomb.  Congo daily atrocities, yeah but we’re good for gold & diamonds at the moment so we’ll swerve it
1217 2018-04-16 21:34:37 Oil is a dead future even economically
1218 2018-04-16 21:34:36 @realDonaldTrump you already know not to let none drill in the Arctic or no areas where there is ice as it cause&effect equaling the flooding of the world,as world is flooding already I need none to speed up on dummies missions for possible oil etc,it's not worth risking world
1219 2018-04-16 21:34:21 Spot crude is dropping while pump prices are rising. Looks like the oil crooks are manipulating oil prices again. Obama put them in jail. Trump invites them to play golf.
1220 2018-04-16 21:34:14 Coconut oil. I also use olive oil and peppermint oil as a hair mask once a week
1221 2018-04-16 21:34:05 This is especially important for island nations relying on volatile price fluctuations of oil.
1222 2018-04-16 21:33:40 I hope someone explains to @ElizabethMay  that the oil and gas industry is an important and integral part of the Canadian economy. #TransMountain
1223 2018-04-16 21:33:37 That’s why I just add oil instead
1224 2018-04-16 21:33:31 Oil prices are up again they'll probably drop but that's oil fir you you get a oil boom followed by a oil slump that's why you build a oil fund money in the bank, pitty that bank is the uk treasury in London, when it should be in Scotland #indyref2
1225 2018-04-16 21:33:27 Apparently worse. He didn't hire him, just talked to a lawyer. Horrific. 
@seanhannity SIRIUS 125 , as per remarks on radio show
1226 2018-04-16 21:33:20 Toaster now unpacked and run through a cycle empty to get rid of the machine oil residue. Soon, it will be tested on real bread.
1227 2018-04-16 21:33:13 Shut down the importation of ME #BloodOil and Eastern "Let them freeze in the dark" people will sing a different tune. Make @CanadaFirst the priority not supporting foreign oil.
1228 2018-04-16 21:33:10 BC the ecowarriors that import coal from the US to export, approve mining wate dumping in the Quesnel River, are supported by Quebec that brings foreign oil into the St Lawrence by tankers and dump raw sewage into the St Lawrence
1229 2018-04-16 21:33:06 Nope. If we’re spending money on energy it needs to be renewable. We can’t afford to burn everything we touch for oil companies profits.
1230 2018-04-16 21:33:02 i feel like a wet noodle covered in olive oil
1231 2018-04-16 21:32:59 Nope but if I get the olive oil I can make my own
1232 2018-04-16 21:32:41 like ppl don’t seem to talk about it often but there’s some interesting commentary on Military Bad. Big Cooperations Bad. Oil Business Is Dubious. War Bad. Those In Power Are Corrupt
1233 2018-04-16 21:32:37 It's was unfortunately SNP that lied about oil as subsequent events demonstrated.

No one said you couldn't use the pound,  anyone can but it won't be your central bank.

The EU said you couldn't remain in the EU.

Let's hope next time you decide differently
1234 2018-04-16 21:32:35 I could write about sickness bugs (from an emtophobia POV) also bio oil for stretch marks postnatal if any use?
1235 2018-04-16 21:32:14 That’s almost what I spill when I change the oil in my three trucks
1236 2018-04-16 21:32:02 texted my mom to see if she’d just get me some oil for my car and she ended up just volunteering to get me a whole new oil change 
1237 2018-04-16 21:31:57 BC will buy American and foreign oil like eastern Canada does!  Bullying BC will have long term repercussions!

1239 2018-04-16 21:31:55 There are other ways to repair your edges with essential oil, carrier oil and protein treatments #bellenioreNaturals @BNiore
1240 2018-04-16 21:31:46 PSA: my dispensary just opened their new facility with a separate smoke shop where people who don’t have their medical cards can purchase CBD oil & smoking accessories.
1241 2018-04-16 21:31:46 Engine Oil and Petrol
1242 2018-04-16 21:31:43 I hope you're right in both cases, but as long as the Dino isn't dead, decomposed and turned in to crude oil, I'm not popping my champagne...
1243 2018-04-16 21:31:35 stop watching CNN and try using your brain for once. Syria was a stable, secular and prosperous country with free healthcare and education and emancipated women before idiots like you decided to bomb it out of existence. All Assad did was refuse to give Syria's bank and oil to US
1244 2018-04-16 21:31:32 Y'all too busy harassing people who put coconut oil on their face, while forgetting there are whole ppl out here using vaseline on their face.
1245 2018-04-16 21:31:27 Bet it was transport to company making CBD oil. Lol
1246 2018-04-16 21:31:25 Amennnn to that
Coconut oil does wonders
1247 2018-04-16 21:31:15 economy is tanking Billy and you do nothing. Stop spending. Tell BC premier to bug off like you should have the only way you get out of debt is to sell more oil.
1248 2018-04-16 21:31:15 Barrel of oil now $70, half what it was when we were paying $1.65p/l 10yrs ago. Today we are paying $1.49p/l. $ was 0.98us now 0.76us. @kochie_online can do the numbers that don't add up @sunriseon7
1249 2018-04-16 21:31:14 so that alone makes him worthy? whats his portfolio like, does he not have ties with getting unwarranted oil contracts. has he said anything that he would do differently other than rubbish the present govt. he doesnt even have a plan set up nor speaks intelligently
1250 2018-04-16 21:31:14 So Alberta can pass legislation about the flow of oil and gas, but BC cannot pass legislation about a pipeline?
1251 2018-04-16 21:31:07 I need to get my tire pressure checked and my oil changed and I need to actually drive 800 stupid miles to get to Utah and I want to kill my self.
1252 2018-04-16 21:30:57 More oil is just a bad Idea and harmful to Canada in the long term.
1253 2018-04-16 21:30:52 Coconut oil, and no straightening!! (Your hair is beautiful natural too)
1254 2018-04-16 21:30:47 yes, and the new govt is already a chaotic disaster, with a 'look at me' selfie mad PM, sending the country down the gurgler.  The oil and gas exploration ban is outrageous. At this rate, a very rare one term govt could be on the cards.
1255 2018-04-16 21:30:43 Seriously don’t like throwing money into my car  I know it’s necessary but like... getting tires replaced, an alignment, oil change, and other stuff I’m not sure of lol, ADDS UP. And I got all this done throughout the week
1256 2018-04-16 21:30:39 Fact of the matter is, if we can't build pipelines in syria for western oil and gas interests, we need to build them in Turkey. Need to appoint a few of the Clinton Bush regime change team.
1257 2018-04-16 21:30:34 おきたくぬぇ
1258 2018-04-16 21:30:34 Considering reactions to the only President who opted for the “Power” instead of “Oil and Gas” ministerial portfolio, the answer is not too far fetched. Today, our eye don clear!

1268 2018-04-16 21:30:01 Look at the subsidies your Gov gave big oil. Hypocritical comment.
1269 2018-04-16 21:29:46 It’s not about oil or natural gas, russia has no problem exporting, actually using the option to not export as retaliation as in Ukraine or Baltic States, or EU. The issue is age -old: they have no access to warm water, like the Med. their other outlets are in Nam & Cuba
1270 2018-04-16 21:29:36 BC  will buy American and foreign oil like eastern Canada does!  No problem. Bullying BC will have long term repercussions! Alberta seems to have forgotten how Justin's father screwed Alberta!

1274 2018-04-16 21:29:02 Time to drag up the Norman Kirk Conspiracy Theory (that he was murdered by oil & gas interests)

1276 2018-04-16 21:28:41 First day of school at new school.  Decided my hair wasn't dirty enough for shampoo, so rubbed cooking oil throughout my hair to make it dirty enough to wash. Couldn't get the oil out and had to go to school looking like a greaser.  I'm a girl.
1277 2018-04-16 21:28:37 On my way home. Had to replace my serpentine belt and oil filter. Broke a bunch of nails doing it too but I got it done!!
1278 2018-04-16 21:28:35 The vaccum return coupler went bad and shot the line out while the vaccums were on, coated tractor in oil

1280 2018-04-16 21:28:20 I watched an interview of Buhari where he told the presenter that Ebele told him our money was spent on buying food and oil from other countries 
Are we lacking food in this country since 2005???
1281 2018-04-16 21:28:08 Are use coconut oil in my hair as a mask in the shower and that should help it or use the 10 in one moisturizing spray
1282 2018-04-16 21:28:04 Oil merchant? Thats so ironic coming from u lmao mate we have a higher chance of winning now than u have being in the europa league

1286 2018-04-16 21:27:51 Why didn't he use a solar panel and short himself out? Isn't using oil or its derivatives against the ecologist mantra?
1287 2018-04-16 21:27:48 I don't know what you are trying to prove. USA is "fighting ISIS" but actually only there to protect Israel from Iran and get some Oil on the way.Russia already started working with Israel, and they love each other. No one is fighting Assad except the Rebels,which is the problem!
1288 2018-04-16 21:27:42 I leave coconut oil in my hair for 2 hours twice a week and it helped my hair a lot :)
1289 2018-04-16 21:27:37 There are already shouts about pipelines & oil
1290 2018-04-16 21:27:34 Put 4 tablespoons of baby oil in your bath water. Your skin will be silky smooth in no time.
1291 2018-04-16 21:27:20 But that was due to high oil revenues. That's no longer an option as explained by Gordon Wilson the growth commission chairman. The transfer is currently 10bn per year
1292 2018-04-16 21:27:14 I rub Lindsey down with Baby Oil w/ Aloe and Vitamin E everyday after she gets out of the shower and it's

1297 2018-04-16 21:26:07 he’s not retiring!  he took several board positions on big corporations (yet to be announced...big pharma, gas, oil?) he will now work on his DC buddies to influence legislation to fill his pockets and rape the environment and all who live in it!
1298 2018-04-16 21:26:05 BC can buy oil and gas from foreign countries as eastern Canada does!  No problem! Alberta and Justin trying to bully BC!  Alberta doesn't seem to remember when Justin's father screwed Alberta!
1299 2018-04-16 21:26:05 The “matter” was likely more in the nature of a “discrete” payment for the benefit of a minor Sean fathered with an adult performer whom he courted at her place of employment - an oil wrestling establishment called the Pink Pony. Or maybe just a routine Fax harassment payoff.

1302 2018-04-16 21:25:40 How can say you are fighting climate change while building pipelines to promote an increase in production at the oil sands when there is so much research to show damaging that is to climate change?
1303 2018-04-16 21:25:35 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President: is very important for the people of #Venezuela,  don't baying any more oil from Maduro regime. Please!
1304 2018-04-16 21:25:22 you seriously just put oats, coconut oil, and honey in a deep pan or wok on med-low heat and stir until they're toasted. Add any other ingredients you like. That is how to make granola. I wish I knew this sooner.
1305 2018-04-16 21:25:05 Have to leave room for the image of the jet fighters flying overhead as oil workers look skyward in triumph

1307 2018-04-16 21:24:56 Forgive me....Indian Ocean port.  

This has all been to open up Siberia's oil fields to other markets but hey, Communism shares equally with everyone else as long as you like Putin.  Sound familiar?  Methinks XI & Putin are the puppeteers....hand up the butts of  Kim & djt
1308 2018-04-16 21:24:50 The week has come upon us ... and... i usually don’t clown at parties... but this Oil Spill  is finna bring the beast outta me @TennStateQues

stormwater effluent. 
-Same cities dump same amount of barely treated sewage into ocean.

Spare me moral righteousness. Oil is coming by rail or by pipeline anyway. Solution by pipeline far safer.
1310 2018-04-16 21:24:47 Isn’t there a split in Alberta about oil vs ocean spills @steeletalk
1311 2018-04-16 21:24:43 Citi on OIL: "Even if President Trump doesn't sign the May 12 sanctions waiver, the end result could be just a redirection of oil flows, with ~200K b/d lost from the oil market, but 1M b/d of Iranian oil could be lost if the nuclear deal collapses"
1312 2018-04-16 21:24:31 they fried the chicken right,  just flour, salt , pepper and clean "Wesson oil.

1316 2018-04-16 21:24:02 //And people say using different oil does not change your fishsticks.
Bullshit, this peperoni is amazing with it~
1317 2018-04-16 21:23:52 Rumor has it that Pruitt used his "special booth" to masturbate while watching oil spills pollute our waterways ...
1318 2018-04-16 21:23:48 I think he needs way, way less meds, at least of the snake oil variety.
1319 2018-04-16 21:23:44 Where can I find the following to make my dream cake from #AtMyTable book by @Nigella_Lawson

; cold pressed coconut oil
Want to make tomorrow but I am missing these ?
1320 2018-04-16 21:23:04 Gown Morgan is an oil pimp.  Even Harper could not save him years ago.  Wwhaat did he say that got him into trouble
1321 2018-04-16 21:22:59 Reminder that coconut oil is not a deodorant 
1322 2018-04-16 21:22:54 That was May and it's because of weapons, oil.. But horrendous.
1323 2018-04-16 21:22:43 ...Planted on him by the American CIA no doubt. In order to have a reason to attack him in order to get that damned oil so that the Elites can keep destroying the atmosphere with its fumes.
1324 2018-04-16 21:22:17 Just waiting for some helmet to tell you that ‘it’s all about oil’
1325 2018-04-16 21:22:14 burning the midnight oil...
1326 2018-04-16 21:22:12 Lol. The same UN that lets Syria head of the Committee Against chemical weapons? The same un data points Arabs to overseas Equal rights for women? The same UN that prostitutes itself for Arab oil $$$? Same one who's president even said they're biased against Israel? 
1327 2018-04-16 21:22:07 What about standing up for indigenous rights to steward how their land is utilized? What about my rights as a tax payer to not fund Texan oil companies? What about the rights of my children to inherit a clean planet? Invest in better energy don’t just give bail outs to revamp oil
1328 2018-04-16 21:21:58 It’s all about power, money, oil, pipelines
They’ve allways lied to us.
When they say something is good. Think twice and look for the truth
1329 2018-04-16 21:21:58 IMO only way gold could be currency whale oil is if CB's go away (unlikely), or if crypto overtakes.  Interestingly, if crypto/blockchain go mainstream, gold may be the best play out there, as there are few mkts more opaque & more levered than gold.
1330 2018-04-16 21:21:54 Feel free.  Oil money is ruining football so go ahead.  Each year will become even more meaningless. You can’t buy your club back though.  You sold it down the river
1331 2018-04-16 21:21:45 So, Alberta is going to punish BC b/c we disagree with Alberta and their oil exports. Won’t this reduce, revenue for oil producers? @steeletalk
1332 2018-04-16 21:21:41 If you give me out of your big boy savings I won't mind.
1333 2018-04-16 21:21:38 Thoughts about ~35 minutes into #beychella2018 

Bey’s highlight has done my taxes, cleared my skin, organized my closet and changed my oil.

1336 2018-04-16 21:21:17 No pipeline... no oil = no money in pocket for Canadians... somebody understand what Canada can export
1337 2018-04-16 21:21:17 If you can’t pay my car note, and my insurance, put gas in my tank, buy me brand new tires , give me an oil change fix anything on or inside my car please don’t ask to drive my shit that I worked hard for man

1348 2018-04-16 21:20:00 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
1349 2018-04-16 21:19:59 If UK Government was even slightly concerned about stopping bombs(of any kind)being dropped on innocents,they’d stop selling bombs(& all arms) to Saudi,who promptly drop those bombs on Yemen,slaughtering thousands of innocents on a daily basis.Its all about oil,money & power!

1352 2018-04-16 21:19:42 But it wasn't good enough for shipping out the vast reserves of crappy oil in Siberia...oh wait! Thankfully, the Arctic melted so ships can go over the top now to the pipelines of Canada and USA down to the Gulf...SA market donchaknow.

We're in the way.

1355 2018-04-16 21:19:34 US is after Syria merely for land to run a pipeline to Mediterranean of Kurd, Iraq & GCC oil. 

And Israel will suck the Syrian water & other resources. 

A hegemonic gateway to Iran & Central Asian hegemony to come.

1360 2018-04-16 21:18:48 Didn't Assad give the rights to produce oil to Russia 2 days before this "attack"? Interestingly, Syria doesn't have a Rothschild bank either.
1361 2018-04-16 21:18:39 Norway's sovereign wealth fund does lots of great work on renewables, it's funded by proceeds from oil sales.

1368 2018-04-16 21:18:04 Seriously though, this isn't all about being nice humanitarians, though I wish it was. Somewhere along the line, I bet someone sees this as an opportunity to get some free oil and/or gas.

1372 2018-04-16 21:17:27 because of the extra nutrients. But keratin, your actual visible fingernail, will not be less brittle. The only way to correct that is to add oil directly to your nails to soften and bind the layers. By all means share your good news, but make sure it is factual.
1373 2018-04-16 21:17:23 I need to shave my hair and quit my job and impregnate a woman then leave her and then start sagging my pants. Maybe then women in my town will notice me. 

or I can just work in the oil field. #TheStruggle #RGV
1374 2018-04-16 21:17:20 Today: furnace is running, prepared meals using stove, run dishwasher, washed dishes, used lights in house, drove to the store, charged laptop/iPad.  All this used some form of energy that the horrible oil/gas industry found/produced/refined/shipped. #buildKM @TransMtn
1375 2018-04-16 21:17:07 CBD oil that close to the eyes? What's the data on that? I'm so excited!!
1376 2018-04-16 21:17:04 Leg and Oil Money.
1377 2018-04-16 21:17:00 Imma start using vitamin E oil and a vitamin C serum on my face. I take the vitamins so using them topically would probably be amazing.
1378 2018-04-16 21:16:57 Chef Gusteau cut up some rotten zucchini, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was chicken, along with cheese.
1379 2018-04-16 21:16:54 I swear I hate getting my car serviced. Oil changes, tires all that other mess. They try to throw mumbo jumbo on you and just a big chunk of your time. One of the very few things I can’t wait have done for me 
1380 2018-04-16 21:16:43 Drinking water and tea tree oil twitter just needs to chill sometimes
1381 2018-04-16 21:16:42 Grave Before Shave has really good beard oil and balm. My go to is the Gentlemen’s Blend which has a bourbon-vanilla scent. I would love a candle version of this!
1382 2018-04-16 21:16:19 @TalisaTossell Hey! No glue slime instructions! 1)Herbal Essence shampoo in a bowl. Make sure that there is more herbal essence than anything else. 2)Add few drops of baby oil, mix, gradually add salt. Not too much salt as it will be watery. More herbal essence if watery! Thanks!
1383 2018-04-16 21:16:13 Ever wonder where enegi oil gets their cash flow from?. Would love your thoughts on this. 

Cuz from local pov they have F all.
1384 2018-04-16 21:15:59 Alberta isn't Canada!~ to make BCers expendable for temporary foreign worker oil contracts in Alberta is absolutely ludicrous. China also isn't Canada @RachelNotley
1385 2018-04-16 21:15:58 Can't wait for @IcelandFoods  to stop using Palm oil, hopefully the rest of the supermarkets follow suit!! Great too see
1386 2018-04-16 21:15:56 I fully endorse black seed oil
1387 2018-04-16 21:15:39 Oil bears getting pretty stubborn? Trade the mkt you have not the one u want
1388 2018-04-16 21:15:37 your oil paint is gorgeous can't wait to see the next stream to see the end result 
1389 2018-04-16 21:15:35 That's why I put my Thrive oil blend in the diffuser and started cranking out the work.
1390 2018-04-16 21:15:32 Check your Engine oil this afternoon.
1391 2018-04-16 21:15:23 I jus tryna get mummy to oil and massage my scalp for me 
1392 2018-04-16 21:15:10 How do the oil and gas companies feel about this?
1393 2018-04-16 21:15:08 Same, I get it randomly! I actually need to get vitamin E oil because I have heard quite a few good things! 
1394 2018-04-16 21:15:07 Intelligence is a fickle thing. His experience doesn't translate to forward progressive thinking. His writings are riddled with hypocrisy. For a person who claims to have seen the horrors of oil spills first hand, his indifference is worse than not caring a all.
1395 2018-04-16 21:15:04 NO, there isn't, but there is plenty of oil.
1396 2018-04-16 21:15:04 Let me know when you hit oil in that hole you’re digging.
1397 2018-04-16 21:14:57 PS All tankers worldwide are double-hulled. Notwithstanding that, there have been several marine oil spill incidents worldwide involving double-hulled tankers.
1398 2018-04-16 21:14:49 Where do you fit sails and solar panels on a crude oil tanker?.
1399 2018-04-16 21:14:37 That is fascinating, thank so much for this! And it has reminded me, on particularly dry tack, stuff that had been stored and not used for example, we'd use neats foot oil (also used on hooves as the name suggests)
1400 2018-04-16 21:14:36 just tried oil. how annoying.
1401 2018-04-16 21:14:30 The only snake oil comes from Democrats, must we remind you about Hadacol...
1402 2018-04-16 21:14:30 What fluid does it pump? Oil?
1403 2018-04-16 21:14:15 Great, let’s get our oil from somewhere else and be done with them. Also, Albertans ski in jeans.
1404 2018-04-16 21:14:11 At the slow ass dealership gettin an oil change and my phone on 38%
1405 2018-04-16 21:14:09 Believe me i am 1st to buy an electric car when they are more reasonably priced.  Canada's economy is not solely oil based but it is hard to imagine an independent Alberta not being tied to oil as Venezuela is.
1406 2018-04-16 21:13:57 Trialling cannabis oil and I don’t mean to be dramatic but I think I’m having a stroke
1407 2018-04-16 21:13:50 I don’t get a lot of acne but when I do I put some vitamin E oil in it after my witch hazel toner and its gone the next day but for another week I still have discoloration.
1408 2018-04-16 21:13:48 Put 4 tablespoons of baby oil in your bath water. Your skin will be silky smooth in no time.
1409 2018-04-16 21:13:43 I also dab some of the lavender essential oil on my wrists and behind my ears! It smells so heavenly!
1410 2018-04-16 21:13:39 i just put olive oil on my eyebrows if this doesn’t do anything imma be disappointed
1411 2018-04-16 21:13:24 Alberta has introduced legislation it says would allow it to cut the flow of oil and gas to B.C.
1412 2018-04-16 21:13:15 you've changed.... (however, don't tell anyone - but add bit of crushed garlic, some wholegrain mustard, salt, pepper and olive oil...)
1413 2018-04-16 21:13:14 I must not know oil, I must scuttle on the balcony
1414 2018-04-16 21:13:06 @JustinTrudeau is gonna have to start shooting Indians if 5000 demonstrators show up every time a protest is called. Alberta already gets lots oil to market every day. Invest to build a new refinery in Albeta. Think #LongTerm Cash rebates for home solar panel installations.
1415 2018-04-16 21:13:02 Apparently, cooking with extra virgin olive oil still has too many free radicals.

Avocado oil is considered the best to fight free radical damage (heart disease/cancer).
1416 2018-04-16 21:13:00 wait 30 min for an oil change or nah?
1417 2018-04-16 21:12:53 @BennyJshow 4/20fact;
Cannabis-infused oil an EZ way to turn any recipe into a edible. This only takes a few steps—you've got to decarboxylate your weed in the oven, throw it in a saucepan with oil, then strain the leftover bud, leaving you with a simple, potent base for cooking.
1418 2018-04-16 21:12:53 But we don't benefit from the Oil we produce. It goes elsewhere.
1419 2018-04-16 21:12:45 After spending almost a grand on various CBD products over the last couple years, i'm of the opinion that it's just today's snake oil.
1420 2018-04-16 21:12:44 Son los mismos que nos vendieron el gas oil productivo!!!

1445 2018-04-16 21:09:13 we launched 103 missiles at 3 strategic locations in Syria on Friday, with no fatalities … our tech is THAT good! :)
... even more amazing, after the weekend, on Monday, the oil markets went down!
1446 2018-04-16 21:09:05 No. They were in the interest of the us petrodollar and the fact that there is oil in the Golan heights so regime change is a must

"We don't need your dirty oil money" - Just send money

1464 2018-04-16 21:06:06 Pure olive oil is cloudy. If clear,  been cut with other types of oil. Unfortunately 95% of EVOO 4 sale is cut. Pure EVOO is divine tasting
1465 2018-04-16 21:06:05 @theresa_may very proud of our prime minister. Rentless commitment to the urgent question over #Syria she is still sitting in chamber after several hours debating and hearing question on her statement.  #Bravo #Strong #Leadership #JobDone

1467 2018-04-16 21:05:49 Sums it up. Geopolitics and war for oil and mineral interests only, by the West now. Last humanitarian war was with  Clintons-EU  in bosnia-ex Yugoslavia. And did that one half heartedly as no economic prize.
1468 2018-04-16 21:05:41 Rubbish ! Nothing to do with 1A or 2A. If my kids invited him to my home, I would also refuse permission. Nothing in the 1A compels me to listen to any form of snake oil talk in my home. @charliekirk11 gets a fast-forward from me.

1470 2018-04-16 21:05:35 Well Kelowna  if you really havent you should do so. You rely on Alberta tourists and many oil patch workers live in Kelowna but work in Alberta.
1471 2018-04-16 21:05:31 oil change 
1472 2018-04-16 21:05:27 If you mean getting more oil and gas...
1473 2018-04-16 21:05:19 lil canola oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder, roast on 400 for 30-40 mins, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside
1474 2018-04-16 21:05:16 Oil, salt, and pepper - if you pre-heat the cast iron in the oven it only takes 3 minutes a side for the char, and then into another pan in a 500 degree oven for 5 more minutes.  Love me some butter, but would rather taste the steak when its this quality of beef.

1479 2018-04-16 21:04:18 advice: can use another kind of vinegar or even lemon, egg should not be too cold... at end, when oil starts mixing a bit harder in sauce, you're not far from end so mix the sauce till oil is absorbed before pouring more oil... add a bit of mustard, it gives the little plus ;)
1480 2018-04-16 21:04:18 I'll add it was Jimboman who pointed this out before anyone.

1507 2018-04-16 21:00:02 With Jonathan/ buhari there is nothing like lesser evil, you can talk about trump and manifesto, but is it GEJ that sold oil &160/barrel and couldn't build one single refinery or clueless buhari you want me to pick lesser evil from? America has their probs but they are far ahead

1513 2018-04-16 20:59:52 And it's never about oil....
1514 2018-04-16 20:59:41 You can literally see the PPM of carbon going up every year by scientific method. You are a shill for big oil. Hope you fix your head soon 
1515 2018-04-16 20:59:36 Instead of this chatter and threats put a blanket indemnity by Alberta in favour of BC  for any and all oil spills that take place on land sea and SHORES OF BC

1520 2018-04-16 20:59:05 Today, Justin Trudeau met with leaders of France & New Zealand — two countries that've committed to curb oil & gas production because they recognize the urgency of the climate crisis. 

This week, he may use tax $ to bail out a doomed tar sands pipeline. 

That's not leadership.
1521 2018-04-16 20:59:00 Oil money/Russian money has lost him top table but still won so much more than THFC and Livpool. Made some mistaken signings. Not all good
1522 2018-04-16 20:58:47 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other
1523 2018-04-16 20:58:46 Is there a Oil pipeline involved in all this shit?
1524 2018-04-16 20:58:46 Should we not then be underlining the benefits of renewable energy? Not just in terms of an energy source but as a job creator and health issue (air pollution as well as oil spills impact health). Sea level rise, acidification of oceans, Gulf Stream changes, etc, all part of mix
1525 2018-04-16 20:58:45 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails
1526 2018-04-16 20:58:37 Phew, lucky she announced the ban on oil and gas exploration in time for this meeting. Was this ban something that @nzlabour had explained would be happening in the lead up to the election? #nzpol
1527 2018-04-16 20:58:34 I can believe it. With God all things are possible!
1528 2018-04-16 20:58:29 Oil prices retreated from a three-year high after Syria  tensions simmer

1530 2018-04-16 20:58:04 Sweden's welfare state is not comparable with Venzuela's socialism. Canada's and US economies didn't *tank* with price of oil. But since you hate oil, quit using it.
1531 2018-04-16 20:57:58 Alberta just passed legislation to allow Min of Energy to restrict the flow of all oil and gas products.  WOW. Good job #Justin
1532 2018-04-16 20:57:55 Living life based on the expectation of worst case scenarios is paranoia. Running a modern society the same way is equally harmful.  Leaders  manage risk. Work to improve how we transport Canadian oil and reflect confidence in those you lead instead of fearing the worst.
1533 2018-04-16 20:57:53 Oil money cunt, you won the league and spent the day bitching on twitter, typical plastics
1534 2018-04-16 20:57:36 Theresa May fails to claim moral high ground on bombing Syria supposed sarin factory

If sarin were present, it would have spread death far and wide

Meantime, she sells arms to Saudi to bomb starving children to bits

Assad’s gas/oil pipeline seems to have slipped her memory.
1535 2018-04-16 20:57:30 Tell America, they will bomb the culprits. That is if they have oil? #WW4 in the making.
1536 2018-04-16 20:57:25 Who told you to carry your skinny legs for yawo,  go and buy okirka shorts and shirts,  go to camp and eat dining food,  and don't Slim fit your khaki trousers 
1537 2018-04-16 20:57:19 Nah... 
DESPERATE to keep us: Lying about the oil, lying that pensions would inly be safe in UK, lying that we "could not use the pound", Lying that "EU would not allow us into the EU", Lying that we could "only remain in the EU if we voted No".
You tried... you tried to KEEP us.
1538 2018-04-16 20:57:17 You just gotta do hella protein & oil treatments. My curls were dead af at first and now they’re back to normal
1539 2018-04-16 20:57:01 Im from Venezuela, and the problem is that the fucking goverment expropiated almost all of the big private industries and they stoled all the money that came from the oil exports (and they are socialists).
1540 2018-04-16 20:56:57 .... As we work towards this objective, we will not approve for launch any own-brand product unless the palm oil ingredient is certified as sustainable under the RSPO - Chloe
1541 2018-04-16 20:56:53 Blue eye won't be permanent but boiled cooking oil will leave permanent scars... will u be proud to do that to a person u "love"?
1542 2018-04-16 20:56:47 ....By 2013 any palm oil in our own brand products must be certified under the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). By 2015 these ingredients must be fully segregated from non-certified palm oil at every stage of the supply chain............
1543 2018-04-16 20:56:37 The problem is leadership. All leadership have been paid off big time by Saudi Arabia. To put it in perspective Saudi Arabia found oil in 1932. They found it. They didn’t invent anything that it runs on or anything else for that matter.
1544 2018-04-16 20:56:32 True. Personally, I think tax revenue from companies, who extract non nonrenewable energy sources, should go towards building infrastructure for renewable energy and making it affordable. Along with taking away oil subsidies and transferring them to renewable energy companies.
1545 2018-04-16 20:56:30 .....Morrisons has made clear to suppliers that our objective is to avoid sourcing which harms vulnerable natural habitats and native species. In order to achieve this we have made a number of firm commitments on sustainable palm oil, which are consistent with availability.......

Result Blue Oil
You pour some of the blue oil into the bath, it turns the whole water blue and some bubbles appear, you touch them tentatively they pop harmlessly.
You decide to get in rather than splash water all over the floor.
You sit in the middle of the water and
1547 2018-04-16 20:56:15 Ok Tnx. I will ask if we have some now
1548 2018-04-16 20:56:11 I agree
At least harper didn't pretend he stood where he didn't
@JustinTrudeau is a liar
I'm so disappointed in him but I was right not to vote for him because regardless of his words I knew @liberal_party LIVES in big oil's pocket
1549 2018-04-16 20:56:11 Sorry, does that mean none of the palm oil in dr organic products come from regions where there has been recent (in the last 10 years) deforestation?
1550 2018-04-16 20:56:07 I’m an absolute moron when it comes to cars and the guy talking to me while I’m getting my oil changed is speaking a whole new language
1551 2018-04-16 20:56:05 Palm oil is an important ingredient in a range of everyday products. Rising global demand for this versatile commodity has fuelled deforestation in parts of SE Asia, which is why we have set challenging targets to ensure that the palm oil we use comes from sustainable sources....

1553 2018-04-16 20:55:52 Canada should be decreasing oil production, and increasing use of clean energy sources. China, India, Europe are using more and more clean energy. We should be as well.

1562 2018-04-16 20:54:59 BREAKING: The Alberta government has introduced legislation that would give the energy minister power to restrict the flow of oil, gasoline and natural gas leaving the province.
1563 2018-04-16 20:54:52 Exactly

1566 2018-04-16 20:54:26 Yep, you got me. Born and bred in Crewe, served in the armed forces, cleared to top secret, you got me there.

You ignorant fool, if you own hand slapped you, you would still blame someone else.

It was a false flag operation to secure gas and oil.
1567 2018-04-16 20:54:14 Your face has been peeled away to show the corrupt deep state official you really are! YOU as many, know damn well Assad did not use chemical weapons on his own people! Another false flag in an attempt to over throw the Syrian gov't! Leave Syria Alone! We have our own oil!!!
1568 2018-04-16 20:54:11 Since the outbreak of the conflict in Syria, Israel has awarded drilling rights for oil and gas in Israeli occupied Syria to a company called Genie Energy (board consists of J.Rothschild, Murdoch, Cheney). 

Oil / Money, Oil / Money, Oil / Money. 

Remember the WMD/ Iraq lies?
1569 2018-04-16 20:54:04 US stocks started the week on a firm note and oil prices fell as concerns that the crisis in Syria could escalate in an uncontrolled fashion proved unfounded — for now, at least.  FT

1571 2018-04-16 20:53:50 What if the whole Chemical story  was fabricate and staged for the interest of another country at the moment Syria has the biggest oil deposits in the Middle East this could be a motive never considered my the mainstream media
1572 2018-04-16 20:53:29 I'm trying very hard 2 get attention from a wise person who can connect dots. THE MAIN FOCUS NEED 2 B VENEZUELA. WHY? It is where Rusia/China/Iran/North Kore/Siria/Cuba, among others dictators are concentrating forces. Why? Uranium, Oil, & close to the USA. THINK about it. please

1583 2018-04-16 20:52:31 But it is beneficial to our economy if we export oil into Texas. Canadian oil exports are a good thing. By shutting down Canadian oil, it then increases demand for foreign oil such as from Saudi Arabia. These lobbyists should be protesting foreign oil imports first.

1586 2018-04-16 20:52:23 This was actually true. My dad built houses then. He had to build 4x4  structures with a roof on each empty lot and have a space heater installed and operating to get a gas line tap. He quit building houses in 1977 and started his own oil and gas company.
1587 2018-04-16 20:52:22 From what I've researched, the energy sector is approx 8% of Canada's GDP, and specifically, the oil and gas sector is roughly 2-3% of Canada's GDP. We're really obsessed with one project that might negligibly (?) affect less than 3% of Canada's GDP. #cdnpoli
1588 2018-04-16 20:52:02 Russia lost 23 million in ww2. Middle East been plundered for oil etc, in fact, Rothschild, Cheney, Murdoch's Genie Oil has licence to drill from Israel in occupied Syrian Golan, yes the 'Sun ' Murdoch, always through back door Downing St, y'know the one.

1590 2018-04-16 20:51:51 I think the point is that it would be better if they sought refuge in an Islamic state made rich by oil. India has too many problems taking care of it's poor citizens let alone a group of refugees whose religion has a track record of attacking Hindus. Common sense.
1591 2018-04-16 20:51:43 Big Buff is a guy the Oilers needed to go hard after before he re-signed with Winnipeg. He’s the stud the Oil desperately need

1594 2018-04-16 20:51:29 I find nothing joyful in any outcome. Look at the parallel between us and Ukraine. Ukraine had oil deals with Russia. Russia employed Paul Manafort to install a puppet leader. The oil deal was threatened and the puppet ousted. Then Russia invaded Eastern Ukraine to "save" them.

Despite your protestations, solar, wind and hydro actually can replace coal & oil using gas as a transition

1607 2018-04-16 20:50:15 Do you realize any work pipeline related in a caribou migration route is suspended while they migrate . Have you seen how steam extracts oil ? Im betting you have never seen anything about the oilfield .
1608 2018-04-16 20:50:10 Typically u can put the Tstat in circulate to verify if the air handler(fan motor) works. If u have a heat pump, putting the stat in EM HEAT mode will kick it out of using the heat pump and make it reliant on the furnace. Is it electric, oil or gas?

1613 2018-04-16 20:49:15 Yes! Study the history of French occupation there. And the oil pipeline that’s being planned to Qatar. Also, the history of the Asad regime.

1618 2018-04-16 20:48:16 This is great. My wife uses it for medical reasons and it sucks because, in order to buy it now, it's close to $300 for a 30ml bottle of CBD oil.
1619 2018-04-16 20:47:50 er... I'm confused.

Why couldn't you just DM me about this

1625 2018-04-16 20:47:18 Our favorite expression for this is “so where do you guys buy your carburetors?” (Pretending to be someone who changed their car’s oil once and is now opening a mechanic shop).
1626 2018-04-16 20:47:06 Sounds like politics. “I want to build an oil rig. This historic thing’s in the way, I’m going to pay you for permission to remove it”

1634 2018-04-16 20:46:11 That's almost what this is. Plenty of olive oil, some lemon but no vinegar
1635 2018-04-16 20:46:06 Well here we go, Justin screwing up another thing, the oil pipeline. But he did say he was going to phases it out, and so it has started
1636 2018-04-16 20:46:01 Making predictions about buying dips in oil back in October 2017 have NO MERIT unless the person making the so called prediction can show the world their proof of confirmation of purchase from that time. Posting it now again, 6 months later AFTER the fact =worthless!
1637 2018-04-16 20:45:58 It's interesting tweeting with them, because one has videos and photos throughout the day. I think we should have acted sooner but diplomatically and not threats. The latest alleged chemical weapons attack looks fake. Its all very odd. Worrying that oil seems to be a link here.

1645 2018-04-16 20:44:52 It’s true. And it’s $85! And they recommend letting it sit in Tea tree oil between uses .

1703 2018-04-16 20:39:32 We have more oil than we need, so export, profit, and face the energy transition with healthy bank balance, not as paupers. Supply doesn't drive demand (a common belief tho) so much as demand drives producers to find supply. It'll come from elsewhere if Canada turns off the taps.

1717 2018-04-16 20:38:37 It’s almost over. When oil prices fell below the cost of refining bitumen, Kinder Morgan’s shares fell 65%. They cut dividends 74% to free up cash for operating expenses. It’s gone. Rich Kinder, past president of Enron, got them a $2B loan for operating expenses. It’s gone too...

1729 2018-04-16 20:36:55 This is mainly a ROR issue IMHO ... More wells each with larger diameters per DSU = more condensate (I refuse to acknowledge it as “oil”) sooner.  Doing so, however, also translates into steeper decline rates, which means you need more wells to = same amount.
1730 2018-04-16 20:36:43 LOL meanwhile, in Olive Oil Land, “WTF this dude just posts pics of his 3 guitars over and over and gets like thousands of likes?!”
1731 2018-04-16 20:36:40 My mom-in-law made a really solid point today about the Kinder Morgan pipeline. It’s much more dangerous to transport the oil over land than in the pipe.

I understand the “going green” thing. But we have to improve current infrastructure while working towards that ideal.
1732 2018-04-16 20:36:38 Approved. I had a nice tea light oil burner with a relaxing blend scent in mind but sage works for me too

1738 2018-04-16 20:35:57 That will force tar sands oil companies to shed more jobs and it will keep royalties low.  Eventually, the whole thing will fall apart.  As oil companies leave, they will sell assets to weaker, vulture entities.  This has already started.

1777 2018-04-16 20:31:44 In past gold standard worked rather well as mining supplied remarkably  just  enough ccy/reserves as was need of growing economy.
When oil (a new economic variable) started to be heavily used the need for ccy/rsrvs grew unproportionally to what mining would be be to provide.
1778 2018-04-16 20:31:43 The tar sands are dead, the entire oil industry is dying( slowly cuz they own all the govts) they woulda been dead long ago if we stopped subsidizing them. ... so let’s speed this along pls.

1780 2018-04-16 20:31:34 I’m at Select Tire Pros having my tires and my oil changed, there are also 3 grown men probably mid 20s waiting on their vehicles as well. All 3 are intently watching Spongebob on the television in the waiting area. I’m slowly learning that you never fully grow up.

1786 2018-04-16 20:30:56 Given that we are now the #1 producer of crude oil, that assertion won't cut it. The world runs on oil.

1788 2018-04-16 20:30:50 As much as I LOVE BEN & JERRIES. I have decided to stop buying Ben & Jerries. Until palm oil is not used! Elephants mean so much to this 
1789 2018-04-16 20:30:44 @Breezin12   Does this count as a random thought Charlie??  Or were you sitting there eating your lunch?  Ranch Style fries tossed in Parmesan cheese and White Truffle Oil  RULE  Charlie!!!  You've GOT to try them!!!!
1790 2018-04-16 20:30:40 Dude same!!!! I used to always use the strong shit with benzoyl peroxide but my skin NEVER got good til I started using castile soap and jajoba oil. Natural skincare always wins 
1791 2018-04-16 20:30:35 CBD oil boosts my opioid effectiveness. I don't want to add another med to my regimen. Plus I can't get an opioid increase above 15 mgs a day.
1792 2018-04-16 20:30:27 It seems to me that your administration is devaluing the dollar with unsustainable deficits. #Obama on the other hand with strong dollar policy had China at the brink of financial collapse and Russia with low oil prices. Don't worry your 35% supporters don't care

1796 2018-04-16 20:30:23 I’m not talking about jobs driven by population growth. I’m talking about businesses with their head offices located in Ontario. That’s where the good jobs are. 
P.S. I worked for an oil company, telecom company and a bank.

1800 2018-04-16 20:29:51 It's not oil, but it is liquid
1801 2018-04-16 20:29:48 Oil companies aren't subsidize.  I'm not sure where you are getting this idea. They pay royaties on the resources they extract. This is the case for all of Canada's natural resources since they are owned ny the crown.
1802 2018-04-16 20:29:48 #MyPastor @pastorthurmon has an oil on his life for building people... How do I know because I’m one of them. Today he went to 3 different grocery stores and paid for random people groceries. #ILoveMyChurch #RandomActsOfKindness #ServingTheCommunity
1803 2018-04-16 20:29:43 Eastern Canada imports 650000 barrels of oil a day from Saudi Arabia . Build more refineries in Ontario and ship Alberta oil there. A no brainer.
1804 2018-04-16 20:29:39 And a square of high cocoa content dark chocolate with definitely no palm oil as an occasional treat?
1805 2018-04-16 20:29:36 It’s about time people stopped putting monetary value on our lands and got their heads out of the stone ages. Oil is dying, bitumen is dying. Why destroy the environment for a small payday. The harder you push, the more people will push back. Be careful what you wish for 
1806 2018-04-16 20:29:35 The greenies cars and buses leak more oil on their way to the protest than the 800,000 km of existing pipelines in Canada do. #cdnpol #abpoli #bcpoli #skpoli
1807 2018-04-16 20:29:22 Please stop using palm oil. I don’t want to stop eating Ben & Jerries but I have decided until you stop using palm oil I won’t buy again

1809 2018-04-16 20:29:08 Have put so much Olbas oil on my pillow my eyes are watering #fail 
1810 2018-04-16 20:28:58 Your politically stuck then. The NDP wants to give subsidies to renewable energy, the Cons want to give more to oil companies and big business, and the Liberals are fine with keeping things the same
1811 2018-04-16 20:28:57 And they still keep coming to load oil that is shipped in trains to the coast and they. Never have problems lol
1812 2018-04-16 20:28:54 In a court order regarding the process of the approval of DAPL, a judge admitted that "the Corps did not 'adequately consider the impacts of an oil spill on fishing rights, hunting rights, or environmental justice.'" #NoDAPL #39CSustain
1813 2018-04-16 20:28:48 You get oil for your head
1814 2018-04-16 20:28:44 Fine with me, but when PP, Sierra Club, Unions are barred from political contributions the left will scream bloody murder.
1815 2018-04-16 20:28:38 We can't refine our own oil...it's too light
1816 2018-04-16 20:28:36 Hey @GasMonkeyGarage, what grade of oil should I use in 1950’s vehicles?
1817 2018-04-16 20:28:28 Legalise it, tax it and establish a Hemp Industry to provide textiles, Oil, building material and a sustainable food source.
1818 2018-04-16 20:28:25 Tom, you Lie like a rug. You made your money off oil and coal. Now you’re singing the praises of everything green just so you can line your pockets with taxpayer subsidies of your Ponzi schemes.
1819 2018-04-16 20:28:23 Bad News: I forgot I'd made an appointment to get my car an oil change today.
Slight less bad news: I was only 15 minutes late.

1821 2018-04-16 20:28:18 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,
because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.
1822 2018-04-16 20:28:16 So much nonsense. No, you couldn't go to work for oil companies and make a lot of money. You are not a petroleum geologist nor do you have any skills they need. You are good at making propaganda videos for children though.
1823 2018-04-16 20:28:15 Are you following the “smart money” into the oil and gas stocks? I like $AXAS $CLR $COP $CPE $DK $DNR $EGN $HFC $JAG $RSPP $WRD
1824 2018-04-16 20:28:15 Holy s h i t my professor just stopped lecturing to insert his highly uneducated opinions on how much oil we have left and climate change! Wow! Old white men never stop wylin
1825 2018-04-16 20:28:07 Very likely the cruise ships yet again. They use the worst quality, most polluting oil (toxic to breathe for theor guests) they re-route waste pipes into the coasts & ditch palm oil into the sea. It's the tip of the iceberg. Nasty ecoli hotels.
1826 2018-04-16 20:27:59 By extracting the oil in the sand, cleaning it and putting it back, planting trees and reintroducing bison to the land. AB is doing a good job of taking care of its land. Meanwhile how many litres of raw sewage does BC dump into its pristine waters?
1827 2018-04-16 20:27:57 This should be justifiable on its own to reduce diluent costs.  But my experience is that Canadian oil industry is very risk averse (happy to be second to do something new)
1828 2018-04-16 20:27:55 @realDonaldTrump Tax cuts are great. Why aren't oil companies reducing prices to reflect their windfall and commitment to help the American economy?
1829 2018-04-16 20:27:50 After I straighten, I put argon oil on the frizzy ends and it really helps.
1830 2018-04-16 20:27:43 For the record, I turned down 2 requests to be an Expert Witness on the marine oil spill aspects of #TransMountain, mainly because of inadequate Participant Funding. My unfortunate #NorthernGateway experience had taught me a hard lesson.
1831 2018-04-16 20:27:41 When I go get a oil change these greasy men try to get my number and charge me a arm and a leg at the same time . Like how that work 
1832 2018-04-16 20:27:36 Take away the subsidies given to oil companies and put them towards renewable energy. No additional money spent, the subsidies are just transferred
1833 2018-04-16 20:27:31 New batch of  Rapeseed Oil & Basil, Garlic & Porcini Mushroom infused as well. New Cider Vinegar due in soon as well. Our Big Rock Coffee ground for filter is available as well
1834 2018-04-16 20:27:22 I need an oil change...cause life hates me. 
1835 2018-04-16 20:27:22 Yeah! Syria is known for its oil and gas reserves! You are stupid! #dope
1836 2018-04-16 20:27:15 The problem is they’ve figured out that forever wars are more profitable than actually owning and operating oil fields. For just another 7 trillion dollars this amazing investment opportunity could be (not) yours!
1837 2018-04-16 20:26:52 I will never use palm oil
1838 2018-04-16 20:26:49 What is the nations' percentage in the oil industry?

1854 2018-04-16 20:25:17 Can only afford Olbas Oil 
1855 2018-04-16 20:24:58 So you are ok with oil companies, big corporations such as Walmart and Loblaws, the vehicle manufacturers,, the dairy industry, farmers, etc, all having their tax breaks and subsidies stripped?
1856 2018-04-16 20:24:56 I have no time to debate people who hate Alberta and the energy industry but take transfer payments and use gas and oil products in their lives.. The hypocrisy is sickening. BC has an energy industry, too but where are those protestors?
1857 2018-04-16 20:24:50 Can’t wait till I’m rich enough so I can pay for a huge oil painting of myself
1858 2018-04-16 20:24:49 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt.
1859 2018-04-16 20:24:37 Both of my points are true: Kinder Morgan does not own oil sand production and the majority of oil sands production is owned by Canadian COMPANIES - Suncor is Cdn, Cenovus is Cdn, Nexen is Cdn etc. But never mind, keep spinning...
1860 2018-04-16 20:24:28 Nothing to do with discoveries of large oil deposits in Syria, close to land illegally occupied by Israel then? Or the fact that Assad has signed an agreement with Russia for them to manage Syrian gas and oil production?
1861 2018-04-16 20:24:11 Please destroy your passport...... Only the USA is for you.

1862 2018-04-16 20:24:09 No palm oil i hope
1863 2018-04-16 20:24:04 When will the #Automotive industry be prosecuted for  helping polluting the planet, like the #tobacco and #Oil industries. They know their #pollution from manufacture and running cause #deaths from the pollution as well as advancing #ClimateChange .
1864 2018-04-16 20:23:49 Doesn't this also leads to monocultures like pine forests which are one of the quickest growing yet least biodiverse and cause acidification of the soil. Palm oil is another example of the appalling effects monocultures cause when demand are placed on ecological resources.
1865 2018-04-16 20:23:45 If they subsidized clean energy like they do oil we would have had it 100 yrs ago and way less people would be dead or suffering
1866 2018-04-16 20:23:43 Exactly. Other countries publically finance their elections and restrict paid political commercials to within a certain period of time (like 2 weeks) before the vote to contain corporate control.  Only this and reversing Citizens United will restore our democracy.

1869 2018-04-16 20:23:36 We look to find new planets that can support life, and then we will inhabit those planets and destroy them as well? 
As a human population we need to look at the facts:
War is primitive, plastic/oil/combustion engines (motors) are major sources that are killing the Earth
1870 2018-04-16 20:23:34 It is doing both. Line 1 provides both refined fuels and light oil for use locally while Line 2 is for export both regionally and internationally

1879 2018-04-16 20:22:40 2nd time ive seen this once u have a full beard an oil it when light hits it it looks like its sparkling
1880 2018-04-16 20:22:28 It’s a good start. Does this mean you’ll also be removing products containing sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) - the byproduct of palm oil that’s used in toothpaste, shower gel and shampoo?
1881 2018-04-16 20:22:24 Nah i had beard oil but ran out. I swear it drinks the stuff

1886 2018-04-16 20:21:44 A rather mixed report spoilt by trying to overstate the case against wood. Clearly wind and tide are better than wood, but wood is better than oil & coal.
1887 2018-04-16 20:21:38 Ivory can be imported now. Oil is more important than Native Lands/Nat'l Parks. The ESA will not apply to threatened species if the blanket sec 4 rule is lifted. Big Business has an easier time with pollution.

1910 2018-04-16 20:18:58 If your oil appears milky or froathy, you've got issues. But if your car isn't misfiring or overheating you're probably still ok.
1911 2018-04-16 20:18:57 Getting An Oil Change!
1912 2018-04-16 20:18:50 The EU is not a major military power.
It's a trade power. It's by far the largest buyer of Russian exports. That's leverage. Syrian exports are miniscule, mostly food, to neighbor countries. It's not a major oil player. So using RU as leverage is smart, and costs less than bombs.

1915 2018-04-16 20:18:35 Underwater vehicle to inspect damaged Great Lakes oil pipes -
1916 2018-04-16 20:18:33 Oil & gas workers in North Dakota have a death rate of 75/100K workers. Do you think wind or solar workers in ND have a death rate HIGHER or LOWER than that? Over all industries, death rate is 3.2/100K workers. Why should we send good men to their death just to pollute the air?
1917 2018-04-16 20:18:31 I guess the trade off is alright though. I took my vitamins. Fish oil, vitamin E, b complex, and multi vitamins.
1918 2018-04-16 20:18:30 She did anyway.
1919 2018-04-16 20:18:26 NASCAR can not be what Oil & Energy or NextEra Energy, Inc. want to make a deal with.
1920 2018-04-16 20:18:21 No doubt but this wasn't pushed by @realDonaldTrump it was pushed by corrupt establishment politicians from DNC & RNC 4 the industrial war complex, big oil, & Saudi Arabia Trump got pulled in by Media pushing 4 public support people like u @SenSanders & @ninaturner r the answer
1921 2018-04-16 20:18:17 oil
1922 2018-04-16 20:17:56 I was just pointing out you are propagating false info. The reality is your generation did choose fossil fuels and failed to continue to innovate pollution controls and alternate energy. My gen. will not have that luxury.  Your shilling for big oil will not change our reality.
1923 2018-04-16 20:17:53 You may not be aware, but a lot of heterodox economists deny supply and demand is useful even for single goods in almost every market but “special cases” like oil, which is crazy (IMO).
1924 2018-04-16 20:17:52 Alot of licking, alot of sucking, sniffing, alot of oil too because there's gonna get alotta of  (I deadass got a boner while writing this )
1925 2018-04-16 20:17:46 Why can’t the investment go to refining Canadian oil for vehicle fuel to be used in Canada? Rather than buying back from the USA?
1926 2018-04-16 20:17:34 What color is that oil going to be?
1927 2018-04-16 20:17:33 Car went in for oil change. Had wipers changed too. This a.m. one flew off in my driveway, the other came off in my hand. Still had white plastic cover on blades. Lesson: Don’t get your car serviced on Friday the 13th. #notsuperstitious
1928 2018-04-16 20:17:32 @DukeEnergy oil extraction from coal is the new oil future that can produce 41%  of our nations oil supply with one plant that needs built . it was perfected inWW 11 and is cleaner no drilling in drinking water.
1929 2018-04-16 20:17:27 At the shop tryna get a oil change only. 
Lol.
1930 2018-04-16 20:17:17 G uses coconut oil. If memory serves me.

1932 2018-04-16 20:17:09 Ukraine has no oil and gas itself, but it is a major transition area. Same for Syria. It was supposed to be a major transition area.
1933 2018-04-16 20:17:02 When there's air in your coolant lines your car has to "try" to get coolant through the heater core. It's like blood clot. There isn't enough static pressure in the lines to overcome it without revs.

I really think it's that. If you're worried about head gasket, check oil color
1934 2018-04-16 20:17:01 I'm sure that's what it is when we all know, no matter which side they donate to the main reason is to buy influence and power. 
1935 2018-04-16 20:17:00 Her sincerity was refreshing. She had a selflessness we may never see again. I don't recall her grumbling about Bush41 getting to do great things: WWII, oil business, congress, UN, CIA, RNC, presidency.
1936 2018-04-16 20:16:57 Whatever happened to that one white chris brown fan who looked like he got hard at the sight of du rags and smell of olive oil sheen?
1937 2018-04-16 20:16:48 I'm sure everyone is shocked Hannity would have any connection to Trump

1940 2018-04-16 20:15:59 It’s probably tender from the scalp being pulled if you tie it up high or if you use clips/pins. Especially if you do this daily. I hope you sleep well. Have you tried lavender oil to help with sleep?

We have surreptitious individuals destroying Cdn industry & it’s working. Trudeau use the laws-show investors they can succeed in Canada
1947 2018-04-16 20:15:17 Worst part about driving German.... oil changes.
1948 2018-04-16 20:15:16 Build a pipeline up to Alaska already, how many millions of tax payer and investors dollars have we wasted.  Let BC deal with the backlash of increasing petroleum costs after we get oil to tidewater and up to par with WTI @JustinTrudeau
1949 2018-04-16 20:15:01 Kinder Morgan is a transportation company, they don't have oil sands production. And the majority of Oil Sands production is Canadian owned.
1950 2018-04-16 20:14:55 ...manage the "new" system thru something like a gold/oil ratio at center, with multiple reserve currencies.  This way, all nations can get compensated for past surpluses, & then go manage going fwd based on energy import/export dynamics.
1951 2018-04-16 20:14:53 Clearly you have forgotten the wars started and fed by Republicans and now are run by the joint chiefs and big multinational mining and oil corps. Don't blame a complex issue on liberals.
1952 2018-04-16 20:14:52 That oil will be for your hair, we need it shining.
1953 2018-04-16 20:14:46 When you get sage oil in your eyes... #herbalistprobs
1954 2018-04-16 20:14:36 Was #Syria not on the cards 100s years ago??? Oil??? Why the fuck does U.S need anymore, the U.S can survive in the Americas for eons... C'mon clones, just let the Romans have their Rome back, y'all know you're not from their anyway, the jig is up 
1955 2018-04-16 20:14:33 The second time I had to float to another unit today I was in tears, the nurse coming on shift gave me a hug and said baby you need some tlc. She put essential oil on my wrist and told me we were going to have a good afternoon. s’blessed. #ParkviewHealthProud
1956 2018-04-16 20:14:26 Typical outburst from Alberta oil and gas professionals on my LinkedIn threads: "Trudeau's a Marxist!! Notley's a Marxist!! You're a Marxist!!" I can assure you, the Marxist-Leninist Party of Canada has no clue who I am.
1957 2018-04-16 20:14:26 it's kinda funny how attachment can breed paranoia
1958 2018-04-16 20:14:22 Make sure they compensate you for the day on the phone ... at least a free full tank of fuel. Oil change and dinner for two at a decent restaurant !
1959 2018-04-16 20:14:21 I’ve been really fancying truffle oil recently.
1960 2018-04-16 20:14:20 Is this the next palm oil?
1961 2018-04-16 20:14:08 Gonna show my baby some love w an oil change and wash today
1962 2018-04-16 20:13:56 People just don’t understand the difference between oil and bitumen. If Alberta truly wants jobs, jobs, jobs they should build a refinery. Construction jobs alone would be huge boost.
1963 2018-04-16 20:13:36 Empire envy and greed for oil
1964 2018-04-16 20:13:35 Like a bad oil slick.
1965 2018-04-16 20:13:34 I’m goin to miss the oil spill
1966 2018-04-16 20:13:32 Why is John Horgan still play this political game? I implore the Alberta NDP to restrict oil supply. The BC NDP needs to know that they are putting the future of Canada at risk!
1967 2018-04-16 20:13:31 Flexible, "well managed" fiat does offer better solution if one does not earn their surpluses heavily fr exports of finite raw materials & esp oil.  Such a system is not attractive to such nations.  Suggests either price commodities at true value (would kill economy), or...
1968 2018-04-16 20:13:25 fine, it can be a battle royale oil match
1969 2018-04-16 20:13:25 @jjhorgan John, please post the EXACT details of the holes on twitter or your website you KEEP talking about in the oil spill response plan for the KM project as a TAXPAYER I want you to show me exactly what you are talking about @JustinTrudeau @RachelNotley @TransMtn @BCGreens
1970 2018-04-16 20:13:23 @enterprise #pompanobeach Taking people money for no reason and giving people cars with no oil in it.
1971 2018-04-16 20:13:01 Why fighting Iran when extending invitation to a terrorist on the nigerian seat of power? Do you also want oil block? Buhari's invitation by you shows you trump is invariably in support of the killings of the IPOB.
1972 2018-04-16 20:12:56 I've inspected many @McDonalds def nor #UK nor are there any claims offering #Halal. Those wanting follow #Halal  diet, consider cross contamination risks; esp oil.

1977 2018-04-16 20:11:57 Hi Maggie,Oh no, we're sorry you had to wait so long for your oil change. Can you let us know which location you visited?
1978 2018-04-16 20:11:53 The code that benefits the top 1% and removes many deductions middle class folks depend on. The cuts are Temporary and will only add to the deficit. You are a snake oil salesman, a con artist, a thief.
1979 2018-04-16 20:11:41 Olive oil??????  OH MY GOD
1980 2018-04-16 20:11:38 Because they're not a news organization. Just a bunch of GRIFTERS & snake  oil salesmen.
1981 2018-04-16 20:11:25 Avo oil: The best first-press olive oil (also depending on terroir) gives a peppery kick in back of throat. This is from the polyphenols. Highly prized. Possible this appliies to avo oil too. Similarly you wldn't get that tightness by ingesting olive fruit.

1983 2018-04-16 20:11:02 They know but they have lots of Russian connections as well. My Sen, Richard Burr has financial ties to Russian oil.
1984 2018-04-16 20:10:57 I just found in my oil diffuser.
1985 2018-04-16 20:10:57 There's certainly a middle ground between being an economic ally and committing dozens of war crimes/murdering untold women and children, to help install a dictatorship in Yemen.

Also, the US exports oil.
1986 2018-04-16 20:10:54 Yes I saw the mention but as you well know markets were busy today and I was juggling short oil, short gold, long spx and failed long dollar
1987 2018-04-16 20:10:50 Harmless? Marijuana is quite beneficial. Before my cousin died he made marijuana oil for his cancer and it helped him.
1988 2018-04-16 20:10:41 I’ve been here for two fucking hours.. like how long does it take to change my oil and align my tires 
1989 2018-04-16 20:10:39 Water, the new oil and so the battle continues. Thank God water doesn't fall from the skies as one highly paid politician said...
1990 2018-04-16 20:10:36 K but what does the oil actually do, cuz it's not like you get high of this

1993 2018-04-16 20:10:19 A green firm will buy Ascot.  Cheltenham will go to a forceful player . York will go to someone who has dipped their dick in an oil slick . Someone will pay too much for the Rowley .

1995 2018-04-16 20:09:48 He is mending; thank you. With healthy food scraps, tea tree oil and coconut oil, he is gradually mending. We took Luke out for a slow walk to the beach on Saturday, he was extra careful crossing the main road. He is learning, that we cannot trust drivers to always drive safely.
1996 2018-04-16 20:09:31 Showing the world the benefits of using CBD oil for the curative and healing purposes of any sickness.
1997 2018-04-16 20:09:23 Who was John Galt?  GALT....Geothermal Atmospheric Liquidized Thorium......Thorium was a non polluting energy generating process hidden and buried by sociopathic banksters to promote oil....Ayn Rand tried to tell us in the 1950's.....AIM for truth
1998 2018-04-16 20:09:15 Thank God for the 2nd amendment & that she was armed. If Democrats had their way she likely would have been unable to defend herself & been chopped.  Maybe he would have killed others. Dems would then want to ban guns & axes. Remember in London the Mayor wants to ban knives.
1999 2018-04-16 20:09:12 Shave. Shower. Scrub face. Wash body. Watch bubbles go down the drain. Dry off. Apply facial moisturizer. Add eye cream. Scrub lips with sugar to remove dead skin. Add oil to hair for moisture. Straighten out kinks. Pull on clothes. Pretend to be ready to be surrounded by people.
2000 2018-04-16 20:09:11 That looks delicious!!!!
2001 2018-04-16 20:08:58 Try taking fish oil every day, about 10-15 grams. It can help surprisingly lot but of course it depends of the individual. For me it helps to balance my mind. Of course it's not a miracle medication for sure but it's there.
2002 2018-04-16 20:08:33 Hey bby. How about you grab that motor oil gurl. @RaineSN7
2003 2018-04-16 20:08:17 Dr Sachs, isn't it true that US trade deficit is because dollar is a trade currency? Big economies like China and Japan need oil from the Middle East, which forces them to stockpile dollar for oil. In other words, US trade deficit is a result of its unique adavantage.

2008 2018-04-16 20:07:35 Wall Street added to gains on Monday while oil and government bond  prices fell on the view that this weekend's U.S.-led missile strikes on  Syria were unlikely to mark the start of a broader conflict.

2010 2018-04-16 20:07:01 I am looking into CBD Oil. A natural remedy for many ailments, physical & psychological, it’s a nonpychotropic part of the marijuana plant. It does NOT get you high! There is no THC in it. It’s legal in all 50 states. Check out lots of info and reviews on YT! Hope it helps! 
2011 2018-04-16 20:06:55 But yet oil companies receive both
2012 2018-04-16 20:06:27 We also have a massive ongoing oil and weapons deal with the House of Saud.
2013 2018-04-16 20:06:25 You can block me but it doesn't change the facts. Alberta bitumen is not a great product because it is too expensive. It also adds massively to CO2 emissions locally. The US doesn't need or want it. Better to invest in carbon-free energy, not increase subsididy Alberta oil.
2014 2018-04-16 20:05:49 obviamente não. é tão irônico cmo seu post. Gostaria de saber ql ativo listado não possui tantas variáveis

2017 2018-04-16 20:05:09 Fairly triggered at the fact that my mam keeps turning off the radiator in my room while I’m not there during the day to save oil and then when I get home my room’s like the arctic circle
2018 2018-04-16 20:05:04 I would tell them it's in its own category, and to imagine something with the taste of acidic tongue cringe, oil, and salt.

And when that thing touches your tongue, the taste falls all the way down a deep flavor-crevice and stains all of your taste buds for the next 5 minutes
2019 2018-04-16 20:05:04 EPS for Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG) Expected At $0....
2020 2018-04-16 20:04:51 They sold all sorts: oil, sultanas, apricots, saffron, almonds, and so many whose names I knew not. The firelight dancing in the merchants' eyes gave their wares an edge of excitement, as if exchanging a silver talent for a handful of dates would bring good fortune too.  #musemon
2021 2018-04-16 20:04:48 The same France that is banning oil extraction in all of it’s territories?  You really do not want the oil industry in Canada do you?  Can’t even believe I think this now, but you could learn from Trump,  be proud of our natural resource! @Lenoregalickkay
2022 2018-04-16 20:04:29 What's up everyone I'm Roni and this is Jackass

2023 2018-04-16 20:04:28 You're trying to change the oil when the transmission is out of the car. Why add something to the game for the old engine that's already been optimized for the new engine?
2024 2018-04-16 20:04:27 If someone shouted "holy shit", I suspect they are in the federal equivalent of lockup right now.
2025 2018-04-16 20:04:24 My hair smelt like a ash tray. Had to throw some oil in dere.
2026 2018-04-16 20:04:23 Dersh doesn't know what hard left is. A true hard left would nationalize the oil, gas, mineral and food commodities, as well as Big Pharma. Now that's "hard left, Dude.

2029 2018-04-16 20:03:52 So I’m at the car wash and this officer in a Waller County Constable car (LP: 116-6222) is in front of me. IDK what happened but he backs out of the car wash, went to the oil place and pulled back in AFTER I had paid for my wash. Now he’s getting his car washed on my dime!
2030 2018-04-16 20:03:43 Oh bless you. Been there twice too. It all worked out the second time for me with the oil. Thinking of you x
2031 2018-04-16 20:03:37 They do not have the technology to clean up bitumen from the ocean floor. It doesn’t float. The oil imported at the very least floats not that it’s of comfort but it’s 100 times better than bitumen.

2033 2018-04-16 20:03:24 I get it just fine. Even the American military is switching to renewables. We have the tech and the smarts to implement cleaner energy. I know oil people will bitch and moan but I like breathable air, arable soil, and drinkable water.
2034 2018-04-16 20:03:20 This week in Big Oil and Illegal Wars saw a new ally in Justin Trudeau. What about all the fisheries, tourism, real estate jobs in BC you are jeopardizing? Congrats on finally joining the dark side.

2044 2018-04-16 20:01:41 About oil and gas I found this: The Trump administration has unveiled a plan that would open almost all US offshore territory to oil and gas drilling, including previously protected areas of the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific oceans. This also doesn’t sound that good.

2053 2018-04-16 20:00:55 Doesn't save anything. Takes about 400 tonnes of coal to build a turbine, and about 1,000 L of oil per year for lubricant. Plus cement, etc. Rare earth minerals cause extreme pollution.
2054 2018-04-16 20:00:55 I dont need to.  Non meat is most certainly not sustainable. I guess if we continue with the current grain / seed oil centric diet  it wont matter as human infertility and disease will bring down our numbers nicely.

2075 2018-04-16 19:59:30 Hardly relevant to the original tweet and reply about size of clubs though is it. By the way City fans love Oil money so it’s pointless using as a taunt, because it doesn’t offend us, it makes us laugh.

2080 2018-04-16 19:58:45 He undressed himself and left only his inner kimono on him. There certainly was no need to bring every thing. The only items he now carried were a bottle of sandalwood oil and his short sword. 

Just in case, he reminded himself with a tiny smile.
He could never be too careful.

2086 2018-04-16 19:58:16 Sitting in the waiting room while my oil gets changed and they have xfiles on YAS
2087 2018-04-16 19:58:04 Yes, of course I should check out the Instagram profile of this olive oil brand let’s see what great content they have over there at the olive place
2088 2018-04-16 19:58:01 Just made lox eggs and onions for the glorious Masked Wife. I’d tell you I had a secret recipe but the name says it all...other than the olive oil....whoops damn!
2089 2018-04-16 19:57:56 Yes you’re right. Baby oil would damage your skin in hot weather. But great idea though
2090 2018-04-16 19:57:49 Bullshit.  You have the highest GDP per capita in Canada as it is.  You're failing to capture the wealth because your politicians are all sucking up to oil companies.

2102 2018-04-16 19:56:27 only if they’re rosemary olive oil
2103 2018-04-16 19:56:19 I rubbed coconut oil and turmeric on my lip wound, which turns out to be super healing. I also thoroughly convinced my husband I had mouth gangrene.
2104 2018-04-16 19:56:05 @geography_411 the negative effect to a trans-Siberian highway would be the cost to create a road system as long as 12,910 miles! This new roadway would go along side the Trans-Siberian Railway and would also have the expenses of a new train network as well as oil/gas pipelines.
2105 2018-04-16 19:56:01 We cannot continue to sell our oil to a single consumer at a 30% discount and expect to have the capital to transition our economy away from non-renewables...it’s ignorant to believe you can do one without the other
2106 2018-04-16 19:55:55 Canada cannot build new refineries due to carbon taxes and environmental regulations, so we export our oil to China to be refined and then be sold back to Canada. Because China does not have carbon taxes.

How does this create any less CO2?

2115 2018-04-16 19:54:16 The sad irony is that Trump was born in Queens. When I was younger, we had turpentine on the back porch to wipe off the oil balls we stepped on at the beach. After regs were enacted, the marine life returned and no more oil. DT is sad and short-sighted.
2116 2018-04-16 19:54:04 After careful consideration I've come 2 the inescapable conclusion that career politicians and bureaucrats in Washington are the biggest fucking crybabies I've ever had the displeasure of knowing in my lifetime....

2117 2018-04-16 19:54:02 Do you have any trouble with coconut oil clogging your pores? I use it in my hair but it's too heavy an oil for my skin except for my feet.

More or less: egg yolk, squeeze of lemon, salt, tbsp-ish curry (or garam masala), tsp vinegar mixed, blend in sunflower oil slowly to make mayo. Mix in diced, boiled potatoes, chopped fresh herbs (tarragon, chives, whatevers on hand)+raisins
2120 2018-04-16 19:53:24 So they sold the debt to the Russians in exchange for letting Russia have some oil, do I understand that correctly?  Do you have a source...again, mine was just one Syrian's POV. Anyway, that's great. Russia is a true friend and ally to the Syrians.
2121 2018-04-16 19:53:01 Mayo must have bad karma because it wasn’t the sandwich construction that ruined the bite, it was the mayo. I like Hawaiian Mac salad but need a lot of hot sauce to drown mayo and I like German potato salad with olive oil and red wine vinegar. No mayo.

2128 2018-04-16 19:52:40 What is a pipeline if not a means of distribution?

One should also consider what this pipeline is for: Exporting Alberta Oil to world markets, i.e. China, to be turned into gasoline, to be sold back to Canada and the world, leaving all the jobs and the profits in China.

2134 2018-04-16 19:51:52 Israel, yes. They treat Palestinians as Nazis treated Jews.  And when they massacre, imprison and torture children, what does the west say?  Nothing.  Children in Yemen are being murdered with British bombs.  US/UK govts couldn't care less about human life, only oil & money.
2135 2018-04-16 19:51:45 Scott Pruitt being bought and paid for by the oil & gas industry did nothing when he was Oklahoma Attorney General to mitigate Oklahoma's earthquakes, all caused by the industry he works so hard to promote. Their agenda is his agenda.

2140 2018-04-16 19:51:14 Not the oil Syria produces, but the pipeline our "ally" the Saudis, who want to put a pipeline to Europe that has to go through Syria. Assad said No, so the US decided he has to go. Only reason the West cares. Accusations of chem weapons just the convenient excuse. Sickening.

This isn’t a black and white discussion, and to suggest that no one who relies upon a system can suggest alternatives doesn’t help.

2170 2018-04-16 19:47:58 What if Russia and China stopped using US dollars to trade oil? 

Wouldn’t that make America mad? 

What lengths would they go to, in order to prevent that? They’d act like desperados.
2171 2018-04-16 19:47:58 Campaign finance reports are in... Wonder if anybody will notice how much oil money I drank this quarter. #CA24 #SlickSalud 
2172 2018-04-16 19:47:52 Just F-ing great! Now you can dump mining waste in rivers,drill for oil off our coasts & Nat'l Parks & drive poluting cars!Water, air & land
2173 2018-04-16 19:47:30 The substance of the debate involved whether to use stated preference methods to value the damages of the oil spill -- doing so would have resulted in much largely figures, and hence likely larger fines for Exxon.

2175 2018-04-16 19:47:18 Inbox is now <20. I should commission an oil painting or an opera or something to commemorate this.
2176 2018-04-16 19:47:17 $575 in tires $200 to flush the brake fluids $235 for an oil change AND TODAY I JUST BLEW MY FORK SEALS $530Owning a Ducati is like dating a supermodel. High maintenance and nothing’s cheap
2177 2018-04-16 19:47:13 Absolutely. And what about all the men with women who aren't oil paintings? There are millions of people with other people who aren't lookers. The way men behave is like they will only date supermodels and nothing less. Bizarre really
2178 2018-04-16 19:47:09 the body has purpose, the conscious is purpose, yet ppl are seeking purpose...Ultimate they just seeing things, and they r unaware of what’s essential, they not gettin they oil, missin blessings from the i, to be pure is to feel the i present

2179 2018-04-16 19:47:07 Not a SINGLE business in this country can run WITHOUT OIL. What kind of idiot would sign this?
2180 2018-04-16 19:46:48 Far greener than any oil sands project.
2181 2018-04-16 19:46:35 actually Syria still does not have debt but instead Russia has the write to take the oil in the Syrian sea, and except that there are still a lot of oil and other resources in Syria. And thanks to it's strategic location after the war businesses will start to rise again
2182 2018-04-16 19:46:19 Do you runa business? If yes, can it function without oil?
2183 2018-04-16 19:46:15 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2184 2018-04-16 19:45:55 Palm oil
2185 2018-04-16 19:45:48 As long as BC is allowed to slow down oil shipments to off shore markets using B.C.’s coast, that is a ok 
2186 2018-04-16 19:45:47 May I suggest olive oil and parmesan on the popcorn? Or a veg tray with guacamole ?
2187 2018-04-16 19:45:33 Oil is critical to your economy and it’s something we all use. Let me know if you need help building the pipeline. I can volunteer for a few hours.
2188 2018-04-16 19:45:33 Every sides of Syrian conflict buy oil from ISIS to one degree or another.
2189 2018-04-16 19:45:16 don’t waste argan oil use coconut make peen smell like cupcake
2190 2018-04-16 19:45:13 Alberta's dirty secret is that the economy isn't based on producing oil, it's based on building new tar sands plants.  That's where most of  the jobs are and that's why they're desperate to build more pipelines.
2191 2018-04-16 19:45:12 They are as similar as a paycheck and a losing lottery ticket. 

#LWCF relies on existing (and real) energy revenues.

The oil-for-bathrooms plan relies on oil prices going up, a fictional drilling windfall, and a dose of pixie dust.
2192 2018-04-16 19:45:12 I'm continually shocked by the number of people not in the business of oil pricing that seem to feel they understand oil pricing.  And seem to know more than those actually willing to invest and take the risk on oil.
2193 2018-04-16 19:45:09 I swear to god if the car service guys find a problem with my car while changing the oil I will lose my damn mind
2194 2018-04-16 19:45:04 Lemon juice and olive oil is the best thing to put in your hair if you're dealing with dry/damaged hair as well dandruff! TRY IT!!! #haircare
2195 2018-04-16 19:44:55 Didn’t think the cbd oil would work but thankful it did
2196 2018-04-16 19:44:44 Please Google "A German Worker," oil portrait of Hitler by Klaus Richter. "When he heard that word ['Jew,'] Hitler's face was immediately transformed into something at once demonic and defensive." Die Zeit: "the only really authentic portrait of Hitler." He had a problem.
2197 2018-04-16 19:44:39 Probably can't get all of this at WF, but I love when BF makes tofu w/ preserved egg, green onion, sesame seeds/oil, soy sauce marinated garlic cloves, scallions. We gave up red meat for Lent and replacing meat in recipes with tofu worked pretty well, I think.
2198 2018-04-16 19:44:24 I've been in class all day I txt my bestfriend this morning asked him if he would go get oil changed in my car. I love having friends that will get stuff done for you
2199 2018-04-16 19:44:14 I’ve thought about CBD oil. THC tho wouldn’t be good for me. I know that for a fact lol
2200 2018-04-16 19:43:56 Neither do I Maria. I’m not sure of the oil bit but I’m sure the situation with Russia isn’t helping. This is as much about them as it is Syria. Imo of course..
2201 2018-04-16 19:43:42 America has put people in power many times over. Recent history it has backfired horribly. 
The reason is oil! $$$$
2202 2018-04-16 19:43:39 Entire oil & gas industry? Entire offshore industry only?....in 10-20 years? Its got to have a smaller effect than people are making out...
2203 2018-04-16 19:43:39 Ur brain is lit. More oil to ur head.
2204 2018-04-16 19:43:38 I have used CBD oil for years for my back pain as well as mental health and highly recommend it. You don’t notice a huge change ‘day-to-day’ but it definitely helps your overall outlook.  I use CBD oil 2-3 times a day (usually with meals) and THC when it gets really bad
2205 2018-04-16 19:43:38 Colby came and got my car while I was working washed it and got the oil changed  forever thankful for you  @Pridmore_22

2208 2018-04-16 19:43:24 This is why #Trump named an oil industry lobbyist to be the #2 at #EPA. If Pruitt goes to jail, Trump still can destroy the EPA from within. #TrumpIsTheSwamp

2210 2018-04-16 19:43:16 Oil and natural gas. Oh and the same old "Chemical weapons" story again. At least they could have come up with a better story
2211 2018-04-16 19:43:11 “If they had used 50% of the money we made, when oil prices went as high as $143pb with production at 2.1mpb for many years, Nigerians would have minded their businesses. The stealing was so much, and they were so inept that they couldnt even cover the stealing properly" - PMB
2212 2018-04-16 19:43:06 Actual oils, I have healed tooth abscesses with clove oil
2213 2018-04-16 19:42:55 I ordered chicken strips and watched them fry them in the same oil as the fish n chips and basically i just wasted my money bc I refuse to eat those but also refuse to complain to them about it :/
2214 2018-04-16 19:42:54 It's difficult to defend actions in oil rich countries when other countries barely get mentioned in the news. Congo, Myanmar,etc.
2215 2018-04-16 19:42:35 Cuz Pruitt, and EVERY Cabinet member, are diametrically opposed to the goals of each of their Agencies and are taking them all down from within. Pruitt is an unapologetic raper of the environment, Perry, big in oil and “clean” coal is Sec. of Energy, Zinke-destroying our parks...
2216 2018-04-16 19:42:32 ....if the National interest is theft, oil, genocide and ethnic cleansing benefiting only the banks and arms manufacturers then the People might not quite agree with such National interests. Hence in a true Democratic Nation a debate in details is very essential.
2217 2018-04-16 19:42:26 I always get a bit teary when you hear about them landing on ships or oil rigs. And you think of all the ones that don't – that just drop into the sea.
2218 2018-04-16 19:42:22 It’s Rothschilds company that owns the pipeline that is drilling for oil on golan heights in Israeli occupied Syria...get real with it

2221 2018-04-16 19:42:12 June WTI oil settles at $66.22/bbl on Nymex, down $1.17, or 1.7%
2222 2018-04-16 19:42:10 I got my oil changed and the guy was like everything under the hood looks great and I feel like that’s still not a good enough reason to say that to someone
2223 2018-04-16 19:42:06 I have some questions about your oil?!!
2224 2018-04-16 19:42:04 Your royalties are a joke.  While Alberta is 10s of billions in debt, Norway is sitting on a trillion dollar sovereign wealth fund.  The reason that companies stampeded to the tar sands is that Klein literally gave away the oil.
2225 2018-04-16 19:41:45 With The Rising & Soaring Costs of Medical Care--- Food---- Oil & Gasoline---

2226 2018-04-16 19:40:58 Someone honestly needs to take my card off me , I just went and bought oil from Australia for my holiday in July it’s only the 16th of April who the FuuuuUUUUkKkkk do I think I am
2227 2018-04-16 19:40:56 Great talk. 
The danger of “Veg” (Seed) Oil should also be discussed. 

Processed foods contain these oils. Removing these foods removes (reduces) the oils in your diet. 

THIS is the “secret” diet pill. 

Target reduction in Veg Oils and you will see HUGE improvement in health.

2232 2018-04-16 19:40:19 @JustinTrudeau @NaomiAKlein I'm sorry Prime Minister Trudeau but I can't support you on this one. Gord Downie championed and challenged you to do the right thing for our country, our people and our future. Oil is still needed, but Canada needs to boldly lead our transitition.

2236 2018-04-16 19:40:08 Here's a random idea, why not lift the sanctions on Russia and use the oil that gives us to put sanctions on Saudi Arabia
2237 2018-04-16 19:40:08 Me battery is going flat sorry gonna have to charge. I still don't see point in n the bombing g for humanity ideology and I think it's about oil tbh
2238 2018-04-16 19:40:03 So...reduces to oil/money?
2239 2018-04-16 19:39:57 @LoveJordanArt how did u get on with that colourful, blobby, large oil - All dry now ??
2240 2018-04-16 19:39:47 My poor boy was sprayed by so getting or someone and now he smells like chemicals oil and skunk! Wtf 
Gotta give him a rinse down
2241 2018-04-16 19:39:43 Ah, ok. Maybe a lot of people think it. Thing is I can’t work out why all the gers stuff gets so much time on here. In reality it’s not about the finances at all. Or the £, or oil, or any of that bollocks. It’s about whose in charge and not much else.
2242 2018-04-16 19:39:33 Two words:  "ethical oil" - I laughed at the obvious hypocrisy of that when Levant first started spouting it. Today's conservative is greed looking for a high horse to ride on.
2243 2018-04-16 19:39:26 Ya. And the only plans I can afford for myself are rated as “catastrophic” and would only help after I’ve paid $7000 out of pocket! So...... time to get my ~oil~ on
2244 2018-04-16 19:39:25 Yea vol pretty low and oil seems to be at a critical level. Might kick myself later but took some profits on my shorts.
2245 2018-04-16 19:39:23 The woman was comparing any intervention/aid etc that Britain does is solely for oil. Which tbh, is preposterous.
Even today with the price so low, as to be unsustainable for producers. There is a glut. Not a drought. Making oil a poor argument.
2246 2018-04-16 19:39:14 Logic and Trumpkins are like oil and water.

Dont go together
2247 2018-04-16 19:39:00 Just realised the water I've been spraying my cat with (when he does something very bad) had got a bit of tea tree oil in it  And some of it got in his eyes 
#CatsOfTwitter #badowner #ishouldnthavepets
2248 2018-04-16 19:38:56 So NZ will now continue it's tradition of trading with war mongers. 
What a pathetic country we've become. 
Last week I thought we had the guts to lead the world by stopping oil exploration - this week we appear to have been 'bought' - our ethics are for sale. Shame on Jacinda

2250 2018-04-16 19:38:18 Have you tried CBD edibles ? They are a little bit stronger than the vape oil.

2254 2018-04-16 19:37:41 do y’all put oil in your mac n cheese
2255 2018-04-16 19:37:37 Are they producing palm oil
2256 2018-04-16 19:37:20 Money, oil, control
2257 2018-04-16 19:37:10 A rather crude summation of global economics. But this goes for almost everything in our Global Economy, not just oil and gas. Take for instance the trillions in investment to be able to produce oil. Who here locally in BC is going to pay this? Jimmy Pattison? The NDP Unions?Haha
2258 2018-04-16 19:37:01 my friends who've been stoners for +20 years currently swear by oil vape as the best way to smoke marijuana.
2259 2018-04-16 19:36:49 Quote from Kinder Morgan. "The Project came about in response to requests from oil shippers to  help them reach new markets by expanding the capacity of North America’s  only pipeline with access to the West Coast. " 1/3
2260 2018-04-16 19:36:46 Stuck at this oil change place for and hour and half.  Lord save me.
2261 2018-04-16 19:36:37 Nothing I hate more than the smell of oil. I get so frustrated when things are being fried 
2262 2018-04-16 19:36:35 We should be outraged that #pmtrudeau is considering giving taxpayer money to a billionaire Texas oil company. Why doesn't CBC research Jack Woodward's recent statements as to why provincial jurisdiction does have legal precedence in this issue?
2263 2018-04-16 19:36:29 Jim Carr minister of Natural Resources is also vice-chair of Canada West Foundation whose soul purpose is to lobby federal politicians to favour western provinces gas and oil companies. Enbridge and Suncor are funders of CWF. Kinda like letting the fox loose in the chicken coop.

2278 2018-04-16 19:35:00 why does looking at animals covered in oil make me sad, but looking at animals covered in oil and deep-fried make me hungry?
2279 2018-04-16 19:34:36 You can't make this shit up--Cohen's only three clients are: Donald Trump, Elliot Brody - Republican National Committee Deputy Finance Committee, SEAN HANNITY. The office Cohen worked out of was in a Law Firm that represents

2280 2018-04-16 19:34:13 I didn't read the naysayer article to see if the fish oil was re-esterified.
2281 2018-04-16 19:34:10 It's in the best interest of the American dollar and the oil pipeline that's planned. If the PM & her cheerleaders gave a toss about humanitarian suffering she'd not of welcomed the Saudis with open arms
2282 2018-04-16 19:34:02 Hate when I'm just in for an oil change and the mechanic tries to hustle me with irrelevant questions like 
"hey who's that in the trunk?"
2283 2018-04-16 19:33:53 Ditto! We took about 3 cups of water through one of our basement window wells near our oil tank.  Not even enough to mop up, really. Got out to drop the pump and the rain had stopped, and was draining on its own! PERFECT timing.
2284 2018-04-16 19:33:52 Oil

2291 2018-04-16 19:32:42 Fox News' Sean Hannity has spent the last 2 years obsessively defending Trump. Now it turns out they have the same lawyer. A lawyer who works for a firm that represent Gazprom. Ya know, the oil company thats mostly owned by the russian government. What a coincidence!
2292 2018-04-16 19:32:40 @JacintaPierce Hey Jacinta! Not sure if you remember me, but we worked together at Turner Oil there at Red Eagle for a while. Sorry I lost touch, but how are you?
2293 2018-04-16 19:32:21 .@Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
2294 2018-04-16 19:32:13 We may get news of our next short term elevator tomorrow. In the meantime we can praise a bearish report. US oil production continues. These morons only allowed more production to happen by propping the price up.

2300 2018-04-16 19:31:43 Clogging! Yet 5 years ago they were better than petrol and 8 years ago we were being pushed towards diesels. The villans are the government who encouraged us to take diesel. Diesel engines are designed to run on other things apart from refined oil, but their evil.

Also note worthy, a female won the Boston this morning for first time since 1985
2307 2018-04-16 19:30:53 I feel like the frier was too high a temp or something, cuz mine was nice and soft, but the film of hard crakly oil on the outside was not appetizing.
2308 2018-04-16 19:30:49 USA and its allies strategically relocated Jews in Israel to disrupt peace so they can control OIL!

2313 2018-04-16 19:30:04 Is there anything in the world that can't be fixed with a little bit of coconut oil? I doubt it lol
2314 2018-04-16 19:30:04 Cinnamon essential oil when used as aromatherapy, can help as a physical, emotional and mental stimulant, relieve headaches and more
2315 2018-04-16 19:30:03 Thank you BMRS Brown & Miller Racing Solutions LLC for providing us with professional Race Hoses and Fittings! BMRS's lightweight and reliable hoses have allowed us to optimally run our oil and cooling systems through the entire season.
2316 2018-04-16 19:30:02 The truth is, ur gov’t was lazy & greedy & didn’t invest in our oil industry ppl even when they knew the boom was going to end. I’m for the pipeline but I certainly am not falling for ur garbage. AB should never have been put in this position but thanks to ur greedy gov’t we r.
2317 2018-04-16 19:30:00 They certainly can be! Fish 'n Chips are certainly turn out a lot better than in an oven. Egg rolls aren't too bad. We tried store-bought mozzerella sticks and they were perfect. Again, if something doesn't turn out like you expect, just add a little oil.
2318 2018-04-16 19:29:56 Balogna is the mystery oil of the meat world
2319 2018-04-16 19:29:53 The rosehip oil works better for my face because I put it on before I sleep and then when I wake up I was it off with the Kiehl’s cleanser and my skin is sooooo soft
2320 2018-04-16 19:29:43 I was considering renewing my KCRW membership, then I saw you got Laura Foot Clark as a guest on this story… What's next? Will you ask Chevron's CEO if opening coastal waters to oil drilling is good for the energy crisis and climate change? #credibility
2321 2018-04-16 19:29:40 “Lamps...were nothing more than iron dishes filled with oil in which the wicks floated, the sort of lamps the Etruscans might have used while digging their tombs.” Gorgeous #writing by Eric Newby in “Love and War in the Apennines”
2322 2018-04-16 19:29:30 Jeez this program is flawed Consider what happens to a wood that isn't managed, hint what happens when a tree dies? With coal (and oil) we are releasing CO2 from many thousands of biomass growth cycles, with wood pellets you can only release ON AVERAGE the same amount that grows
2323 2018-04-16 19:29:27 Libs claiming people are going to die, Armageddon is just around the corner, Russians are coming and we are focused on a porn star. 
2324 2018-04-16 19:29:20 Ice packs, peppermint oil, shoulder rub from hubby, sleep, regular coffee, ice cold water, throwing up... lol
2325 2018-04-16 19:28:58 Nobody gave it to me and I didn't take it. But I prefer to pick my own charities rather than let politicians do it (for their political reasons).
2326 2018-04-16 19:28:50 And proper oil money!
2327 2018-04-16 19:28:39 So sad to see bertuccis in the taunton mall is closed.. they are my go-to for bread and oil. Idk what I’m gonna do now
2328 2018-04-16 19:28:38 I need to start using carrot oil on my skin this summer.
2329 2018-04-16 19:28:35 I never claimed BC was green.  But we're not Alberta.  You're a mini petro state, beholden to oil companies.  All that oil and still a $9 billion deficit.  Why?  Cuz you kiss oil companies asses and give away the oil to boot.  You're in a bind, you need to solve your own problems
2330 2018-04-16 19:28:34 Trump isn't walking it back, his illegal actions in Syria, was part of the Putin/Trump plan to make Trump look good and gain ground for the Oil Pipeline in Syria for Putin, we are caught up in their psychotic game
2331 2018-04-16 19:28:32 You do know he takes campaign donation from big oil just another liberal hypocrite.

2349 2018-04-16 19:26:08 Gonna be waiting on an oil change for awhile, so let’s do a Q&A to help pass the time. 

Tweet us questions on quite literally anything.
2350 2018-04-16 19:26:07 Scots have broken nothing
Westminster has over 40 years near bankrupted an oil rich UK
Let that sink in,,it takes a while then the anger comes as you think of what we could have been if WM didn't take 92% of scots oil revenue>
2351 2018-04-16 19:25:54 I believe he might taste better sauteed with olive oil and garlic.
2352 2018-04-16 19:25:47 Ughhhhh I was supposed to go get my oil change today 
2353 2018-04-16 19:25:43 im a real truck freak. i like axles. i like oil. i like those skateboards for your back
2354 2018-04-16 19:25:31 Just read an article about how there should be more women executives at oil & gas companies and very very nearly just gave up on life
2355 2018-04-16 19:25:28 Afghanistan sure has a lot of oil huh
2356 2018-04-16 19:25:21 Perhaps, but the problem is that there is no recourse for recovery of costs from "bankrupt" oil companies.  Costs will devolve to the government.  Perhaps only in the times of our children and beyond.
2357 2018-04-16 19:25:16 Today, in the works is a free trade agreement between #Japan, #China, & #SouthKorea, who together account for nearly a fifth of global #GDP. #Asia chances to control #crude #oil price rises when these three superpowers will unite.

2360 2018-04-16 19:25:13 @debitx Hey, that's okay. If you ever have questions about either (or CBD oil), will you give us a shout?
2361 2018-04-16 19:25:07 What National interest exactly? Oil? VETO power was carefully given to just 5 Nations in which non is a Muslim Nation, still the outcry on Russia is astonishing, She clearly don't consider Yemen citizens to be Human beings and White Phosphorous to be a Chemical.
2362 2018-04-16 19:25:06 Jayden had it & he still has alittle. His doctor just told us to put baby oil on it 20 mins before his bath and use his brush to brush in circler motion!
2363 2018-04-16 19:25:03 S/o to the guys that did my oil change and didn’t try to scam me
2364 2018-04-16 19:25:00 Not to my knowledge. Only medical is legal. Capsules, oral solution and or oil vape. It's illegal to smoke. Which in my opinion is bs.
2365 2018-04-16 19:24:59 Make a homemade turmeric mask, with coconut oil and witch hazel
2366 2018-04-16 19:24:49 Went to get an oil change and left with a broken a/c. Happy Monday!!!
2367 2018-04-16 19:24:28 The CBD oil I ordered last week is scheduled to arrive on Wednesday. I'm so excited to try it and hopeful it will help my pain. I pray this helps my pain. #spoonie

2370 2018-04-16 19:23:54 @shefvaidya Will do that. I have already boycotted made in China products, Western imports and middle eastern oil.
2371 2018-04-16 19:23:54 My boss let me off early but I still gotta get my oil changed, go to the bank, and pick Misty up. Why did I ever wanna grow up
2372 2018-04-16 19:23:49 Uganda the pearl of Africa is such a gifted country, look at the oil, the Athletes, the Nile,Lake  Victoria, if we had great leaders to actually invest in these economic opportunities. Ugandans would be living  better lives. Bt we are slaves

2383 2018-04-16 19:22:06 Only my mother would put oil on me and not rub it in .. and if you know her then that just explains everything 
2384 2018-04-16 19:21:53 #kindermorgan - Corrigan - terrible that KM is getting media attention for outright fabrications - emb. that PM and oil lobby working for multi-national corps
2385 2018-04-16 19:21:45 It is - especially with extra chili oil. Not as good as the “fancy” ramen place, but cheaper and it hits the spot.
2386 2018-04-16 19:21:32 "Maybe there was some pheromone in the air."

It's called peanut oil.  And it's delicious.  And addicting.  It's how they get you.
2387 2018-04-16 19:21:21 Soooo oil products magically appear when needed,,, oh my,,,,
2388 2018-04-16 19:21:16 Getting an oil change and feel bad for the poor jiffy lube dudes who have to get into my dirty car to drive it into the thing
2389 2018-04-16 19:21:12 That's only common sense. I've believed that for years, ever since I found out that our largely foreign-owned oil industry is selling bitumen at 1/3 off to Texas refineries and selling the refined product back to us at world price. That's all thanks to Ralph Klein, etc. #cdnpoli
2390 2018-04-16 19:21:11 I have a recipe which I will share soon but key ingredients are tomato purée and passata, garlic infused oil, fresh basil and finely chopped mixed peppers. Hope that helps! The lasagne recipe is live now too if you fancy it 
2391 2018-04-16 19:21:08 We have become a Nazi monster in the eyes of the whole world—bullies and bastards who would rather kill than live peacefully. We are not just Whores for power and oil, but killer whores with hate and fear in our hearts.

2392 2018-04-16 19:21:03 @keithbaldrey Is it true that oil pipeline could run south through Alberta into the USA to be sold there, but shareholders want the higher earnings from selling to Asia ?
2393 2018-04-16 19:20:58 Why does my car take the most expensive ass oil? $70 for an oil change, even after a 15% discount 
2394 2018-04-16 19:20:49 Pipeline leaks 290,000 litres of oil and saltwater in northern Alberta
2395 2018-04-16 19:20:34 Have you seen the Michael Mosley iplayer tv shows? Or his books? One local GP is a huge advocate of Mediterranean Diet as working better than statins + w/ fewer side effects. He did a couple of local lectures on it (Dr Simon Poole), + wrote his own omega 3, olive oil book, also.
2396 2018-04-16 19:20:28 @CBCNews @Khelsilem @UBCIC CBC is now interviewing Chief LeBourdais right as the Mayor of Burnaby was going to talk. He’s talking about jurisdiction and just said they told him “we can do that” in regard to keeping the oil in the pipeline.

2398 2018-04-16 19:19:46 Not accepting more block offers is hardly an “oil ban”. Madness? That would be carrying on doing what we’ve always done and somehow expecting our emissions to drop - the approach of the last lot.
2399 2018-04-16 19:19:23 MCT oil?! Didn't expect that -.-
2400 2018-04-16 19:19:22 @elonmusk hello sir, just a random thought why not create a prototype that costs less to produce oil from plastic, the tech is there but the cost is way too high and people are ready to invest on something like this if it costs cheaper and help save our environment...
2401 2018-04-16 19:19:17 Is he banned, is there a crackdown on snake oil salesmen?
2402 2018-04-16 19:19:13 Why hasn't @theresa_may may faced action against the chemical attack against her own people& a #Russian citizen, why is Syria so special to #Globalists, is it the natual gas&oil they want their blood thirsty hands on & to stop a gas pipeline to Europe. #MayMustGo
2403 2018-04-16 19:19:13 No..."B12" is NOT a bacteria, D3 is not a "hormone", and DHA comes from breast milk and fish oil...not plants.  Taurine only occurs naturally in fish and meat, so if we are deficient, they are the only things we can get it from.

2418 2018-04-16 19:17:52 1. FIRST! We must choose a painting style that you enjoy the most. There’s acrylic, oil, watercolours, and many more. So I’m going to be showing you a few so you can know which one you’d like to try out :)

2420 2018-04-16 19:17:40 They have an oil change cheap at Triple K garage.
2421 2018-04-16 19:17:29 Nothing says adulting like dropping $145 on some simple things like an oil change and alignment. It’s fine. I’m fine. It’s fine.

2428 2018-04-16 19:16:11 There’s too much oil and no county wants someone else’s oil now Even Saudi Arabia is diversifying into electricity with the largest solar energy station. 52 sq km of it !

2434 2018-04-16 19:15:20 there is no combining of heavy oil and water. Nor can a religion of good and love merge with  a grought of hate and legal murder mesh.   Our very constitution formed by a just and mercyful God  no Islam defeated death and rose again.

2436 2018-04-16 19:15:02 Commodore Zinke, America's favorite nimrod, is selling off our public lands to mining, oil, and wealthy interests. Kind of makes you wonder what he gets out of this?
2437 2018-04-16 19:14:53 @jjhorgan I can understand your thinking of not wanting supertankers on loading oil in your back yard but I could do without the 6000 semi trucks that transport the imported goods from your ports that pollute the air I breathe in my back yard

2446 2018-04-16 19:13:02 Rubbish.There's vaults with enough evidence to put Assad in the Hague for war crimes against his own citizens. All because some people went on pro democracy marches in 2011. It's Russias vetos that stops prosecution happening. Russia has been given access to Syrias oil in return.

Other places we’ve been and helped.

2463 2018-04-16 19:11:08 Caught between hardliners and the big industrial bureaucracies -- @crmiller1 says military, oil, and agribusiness. These were just self-interested lobbies that wanted to raid the state budget. Whatever their ideology, not western economics.

Most of us have a relative or friend we care deeply about, but they don't get along so we must distance ourselves.

We care deeply about migrants' humanity, but our cultures are oil and water. 

Unless we are to promote social and cultural suicide, they must return home.

2474 2018-04-16 19:09:56 This "new" revelation is more of the opposition burning the oil fields as they retreat.   Look at the scalps Trump has collected the past few weeks.  He's only getting started.  Deep State is just starting to eat their own...
2475 2018-04-16 19:09:46 Well for starters he appointed Pruitt head of the EPA and he's steering it from political back to it's pure focus on "clean air and water" Trump is also bringing back US production oil and natural gas which means we import less, less tankers in the ocean & US refineries r cleaner

2480 2018-04-16 19:09:11 Pruitt must be cutting Trump in on all his backroom deals with oil execs. The boss always gets a cut!

Stop trying to lock your grandkids into a dirty fuels.  Deal with your oil addiction so they don't have to.
2486 2018-04-16 19:08:22 What about getting Canadian oil products to Asia Pacific & global markets by means of a 100% Canadian passage versus thru American soil? Otherwise we’re stuck receiving what the US feels like paying for our oil. Not to mention any forthcoming Trump Tariffs.

2492 2018-04-16 19:08:00 Theyve literally done so before, about oil.

2499 2018-04-16 19:07:19 In Pruitt's defense, it would be a political disaster if EPA staff were to overhear any of his many calls to Oil/Gas/Coal Co. executives, assuring them that he would reverse nagging regulations and NOT prosecute/charge for any possible pollution already occurring.

2501 2018-04-16 19:06:58 I congratulate Karnataka for this development, though solar power has almost negligible utility. Ditto with other forms of the so-called "green energy". I'd rather use crude oil and coal.

Since when have BJP states led in anything even remotely beneficial?
2502 2018-04-16 19:06:52 I’ve used: day serum, night serum, marula oil, b-hydra gel, and polypeptide cream. They’re all so great! I also am gonna be trying the “sukari babyfacial” as soon as it’s shipped to me! Lol.

2553 2018-04-16 19:01:03 Could it be that not enough is being done to make these products and services more affordable for the middle class?
And oil is already costing us money through clean up costs, long term costs from spills and leaks, and through subsidies and tax breaks offered to oil companies

2573 2018-04-16 18:58:45 Devotion to equality just that strong?
Prob not.
2574 2018-04-16 18:58:34 IT SAYS I CAN USE OIL AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR BUTTER BUT WILL IT BE GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!??
2575 2018-04-16 18:58:29 @Morrisons when will you do the responsible thing and remove palm oil from your own brand products? They are some of the best around usually.
2576 2018-04-16 18:58:23 Agreed, but the cause is from two massive global human contributions, not just one. CO2's & mankind's direct aquatic thermal contribution, which might escalate even further, might aquatic oil extraction also be shown to be a contributing factor.
2577 2018-04-16 18:58:21 i played like 3 hours of raven shield multi but i get this recurring dream at a custom oil refinery map with glaring sodium vapour lamps
2578 2018-04-16 18:58:12 #RedForEd you have @dougducey, @AZChamber and @AzGOP in full retreat. Stay strong, stay focused. The people of AZ are with you!  No more snake oil and imaginary/magical thinking funding proposals for AZ PUBLIC EDUCATION!
2579 2018-04-16 18:58:09 Chorizo and blood sausage with cheddar and feta topped with avacado, grilled onions, and bean sprouts, with honey mustard and oil and vinegar on toasted rye.
2580 2018-04-16 18:58:08 Cannabis oil lol.
2581 2018-04-16 18:57:47 Ha ha ha! You might want to take a look at current and forecasted oil consumption.
2582 2018-04-16 18:57:32 there was no motive for Assad to carry out this attack! Wake up people, the west is only doing this for their own good! Why doesn't the UK help people in Saudi Arabia who are also being murdered by its government?? Because they get cheap oil. UK doesn't care about people
2583 2018-04-16 18:57:31 I say let them kill each other! Let them solve their problems. We have enough oil in the America’s.
2584 2018-04-16 18:57:27 I remember rebuilding the gearbox in an industrial Hobart mixer back in the day. It was still in use in the bakery when I went to pick it up, dripping gear oil in the cake mix!
2585 2018-04-16 18:57:24 guy who fried weavile with the FLAMING ass oil greasy like checkers
2586 2018-04-16 18:57:23 Thanks! Everything tastes better with olive oil anyway!
2587 2018-04-16 18:57:19 What on earth is CBD oil ?
2588 2018-04-16 18:57:17 That is completely inaccurate and does not even come close to the cost of obtaining raw material, transporting and manufacturing plastic. 4% of oil is raw material for plastics. That's an unextracted, unusable, unprocessed volume.
2589 2018-04-16 18:57:16 @BNN interview @CatherineBizTV with @AJWVictoriaBC reflected many inaccuracies: no one wants this oil? Heavy oil most demanded by refineries. @JustinTrudeau propping up @KinderMorgan? they don’t need our $. Stock trend of KML? up since launch despite energy sector weakness.
2590 2018-04-16 18:57:12 I mean, obviously spilling oil everywhere is the proximate problem, but spending tons of money making obfuscatory arguments through academic proxies with the same content as OP to avoid paying for it isn't great.
2591 2018-04-16 18:57:09 Hahaha sir with all your oil money your state is as worst as mine even your football team can’t say *goal ball* beside my team.
2592 2018-04-16 18:56:55 I like hot coffee to melt coconut oil.I drink flavored coffees which taste good cold.I rarely reheat in microwave.
2593 2018-04-16 18:56:49 Because there was no motive for Assad to carry out this attack! Wake up people, the west is only doing this for their own good! Why doesn't the UK help people in Saudi Arabia who are also being murdered by its government?? Because they get cheap oil. UK doesn't care about people
2594 2018-04-16 18:56:42 Growers, testers,  entrepreneurs, farmworkers, sellers, delivery, bakers, candymakers, oil extraction, etc
2595 2018-04-16 18:56:41 From then you wanna moisturize your hair daily. A great moisturiser that also deals with breakage is the cantu leave in repair cream or the revlon special feeling glycerine and oil activating spray x

2598 2018-04-16 18:56:16 Try jojoba oil. My locs get dry and it works well
2599 2018-04-16 18:56:16 All those jurisdictions need to start moving away from #fossilfuels. The oil we'll use tomorrow will come via the same means we get it today, + we'll work to use less + less over time. That's what a transition is. Expanding both capacity + markets via KM is the opposite of that.

2606 2018-04-16 18:55:18 Excellent:))
2607 2018-04-16 18:55:13 Probably because Senor Chavez nationalised all the American oil companies who were pumping oil. So don’t be surprised that the resulting sanctions upset his applecart in retaliation.
2608 2018-04-16 18:54:56 I’ll be there!

2610 2018-04-16 18:54:39 How do you end up with Olbas Oil on the scalp?
2611 2018-04-16 18:54:37 @billburr We're bombing Syria because the EU wants to build an oil pipeline from the Middle East to Europe to undercut Russian oil.    So of course Russia is against.    Notice how the European countries couldn't wait to hop on board?
2612 2018-04-16 18:54:35 None of the oil from the tar sands will be used in Canada.

Even if all the pipelines were built.
2613 2018-04-16 18:54:32 El peak oil es un concepto que habla de la Tasa de Retorno Energética. Por favor, no hagamos demagogia con las leyes de la física, no hay petróleo infinito, ahí te has colado Rallo
2614 2018-04-16 18:54:30 I thought you cared about our oceans, our environment? Were you just lying or do you just care about protecting our environment and our future less than oil money? Shame on you
2615 2018-04-16 18:54:17 Needed dat oil change
2616 2018-04-16 18:54:11 Sickened by Macron boasting that he convinced Trump over Syria strikes. While the Holy Trinity play at Empire building over big oil (what else?), the Syrian people continue to suffer #Macron

2618 2018-04-16 18:53:58 For your organics and skin care cosmetics such kojic acids, sepi white, aburtine powder, lavender oils, Orange oils, lemon oils, fairy knuckles, half cast oil Malaysian oils, Egyptian talking oil, skin free and all cream and soap production. I deliver to any part of the country.
2619 2018-04-16 18:53:54 Wanking Tip No. 2- use VCO or Virgin Coconut Oil when you wank. It's good for the skin and is edible- so your partner can still suck you in the middle of your wank session.

PS: Do NOT use VCO as a condom lube!
2620 2018-04-16 18:53:50 Guess I'll get some of that all-natural no sugar added stuff.  I'll still mix it though since just taking the oil off the top is cheating.  I guess we'll find out this evening whether I ruin my kitchen or revolutionize culinary science as we know it!

2623 2018-04-16 18:53:18 Excellent! I love Kirkland olive oil too - so tasty and such a bargain!
2624 2018-04-16 18:53:18 Yeah, but it’s ‘all about oil’, and Jeremy wants peace and has fought racism all his life, and, “foodbanks!” and, er, stuff.
2625 2018-04-16 18:53:12 Unreal. Iniesta is leaving for China at 33 to not only get paid like an oil sheikh, but to also sell 2 million bottles of his wine a year. Secure the bag king.
2626 2018-04-16 18:53:08 I could write about bio oil and eczema!
2627 2018-04-16 18:52:52 Someone needs to ask loretta to check for oil leaks while she is under the bus.
2628 2018-04-16 18:52:42 Friends & Money... Oil & Water.
2629 2018-04-16 18:52:25 Puerto Rico doesn’t have oil.
2630 2018-04-16 18:52:22 Another extractive industry: minerals, oil, gas, coal, and the Peoples’ health and wealth.
2631 2018-04-16 18:52:21 @JustinTrudeau Canadians don't want our tax dollars spent to subsidize a US oil company. Please don't do this.
2632 2018-04-16 18:52:09 I don't share optimism. The left is relentless and they have the very institutions they are trying to destroy aiding them in efforts.
2633 2018-04-16 18:52:08 @EricDJuly I think you know the government is playing the okie doke on the American citizens, Assad didn't gas those kids, if anything it was the terrorist who he is fighting did it so we can bomb them, there are 2 main oil pipelines running threw syria we want control of also
2634 2018-04-16 18:52:05 It's an endless journey now the conservations  like national parks are displaced by oil activities and climate change.And yet those small men were getting what was needed for survival from the environment,the forests sustainably!
2635 2018-04-16 18:52:03 I don't know about Davis Dr., but the price can easily come down once we get away from the Oil companies
2636 2018-04-16 18:51:58 So B.C. and Ontario continue to contaminate water by dumping raw sewage but Alberta oil is "dirty"?
2637 2018-04-16 18:51:57 I am a LORENZO'S OIL dead-ender, so I'll be totally here for it no matter what Miller tackles next.
2638 2018-04-16 18:51:57 I have been to Lagos just once, i exclaimed on seeing that Ejigbo traffic and evrybody there went 'oti ri anything', i till date cant conjure up an image in my head of a worse gridlock scinerio
2639 2018-04-16 18:51:54 Pls how on earth did a hairdresser from SW get an oil block?
2640 2018-04-16 18:51:35 40% of all the oil exploration in Sudan is handled by Chinese!
2641 2018-04-16 18:51:19 《オリーブ油豆知識》

酸化されにくいオレイン酸を多く含む
他の食用の油脂に比べて酸化されにくく固まりにくい性質を持っている
2642 2018-04-16 18:51:12 I find coconut oil helps moisturize while protecting the skin. Hope it disappears soon. Unless you like the high school hickey look
2643 2018-04-16 18:51:11 You know, come to think of it, I wouldn’t be surprised. Depending on what kind of peanut butter it is, the oil may be beneficial. However, there is the added component of sugar.
2644 2018-04-16 18:51:06 If your hair's constantly breaking you probz need a protein treatment-which rebuilds your hair from damage and combats breakage.  I'd suggest you try treating your hair with egg, a spoon of honey and olive oil. If you have the coins try the tresemme keratin smooth (YUP!).
2645 2018-04-16 18:51:03 I love the smell of lavender! It makes a great essential oil too! Multiple uses! I put several drops in my diffuser this morning! Very relaxing
2646 2018-04-16 18:50:54 We need multiple routes for our oil. Alberta needs refining capability, pipelines to USA, pipeline to Churchill, and BC if they want. Multiple options give us leverage. Time to be firm.
2647 2018-04-16 18:50:48 water bong vs oil vape final. Oil vape is the winner.
2648 2018-04-16 18:50:44 I need an oil change

Not my car...me
2649 2018-04-16 18:50:38 My remarks on the @MayorOfLA's #SOTC: "we all demand clean air, safe and affordable water. There are over half a million people living within a half mile of oil wells and toxic facilities in Los Angeles..." #PeoplesSOTCLA #FixLA
2650 2018-04-16 18:50:26 @BCGREENS While you are on a 'save the environment from potential disasters' crusade, how about halting all shipments of oil and gas from the mainland to Vancouver Island in case a ship sinks. Remember Exxon Valdes???
2651 2018-04-16 18:50:25 The @CPC_HQ whine and cry about job losses due to the #TransMountain pipeline being delayed, yet jobs have in the oil patch have been dropping for years. Maybe #Alberta should diversify their economy instead of forcing Tar Sands on BC. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #ProtecttheInlet
2652 2018-04-16 18:50:20 lol I have labs so I know the feeling. If you give your dog salmon oil everyday it cuts the shedding out
2653 2018-04-16 18:50:15 Oil prices are likely to collapse later this year, Barclays forecasts #Forex
2654 2018-04-16 18:50:03 Let Oil go to $150/bbl. Arab nations will regret it. We will stop using petrol/diesel vehicles, walk more, cycle more and use more public transport. I am getting a bicycle by Thursday.
2655 2018-04-16 18:49:57 Dónde puedo conseguir cbd oil?
2656 2018-04-16 18:49:50 Maybe your hair doesn't like coconut oil. Try shea butter and see if there's any difference. My hair hates coconut oil and makes its brittle too.
2657 2018-04-16 18:49:50 So have we but then I worry about all the trees being chopped down for the palm oil 
2658 2018-04-16 18:49:19 Lowkey were smokestacks = cloud factories just our parents brainwashing us to support the big oil and coal companies
2659 2018-04-16 18:49:13 Milk makeup dropped a mascara called Kush Mascara with cbd oil ! I need that

2661 2018-04-16 18:49:03 You are aware of what a horrific state Libya is in right now. He went back to Libya after we had destroyed it. Do you think he might have had family there. All these wars are for oil.
2662 2018-04-16 18:48:59 Quite surprised we aren’t allowed to dump used motor oil into the river...yet
2663 2018-04-16 18:48:54 That SE bracket is strong. Oil vape all the way. Dabbing might make a run but if appearance/usability is a factory, it will fall. You gotta carry too much equipment and you look like a crackhead heating up the nail.
2664 2018-04-16 18:48:53 We are two different people. Like oil and water. We just don't mix.
2665 2018-04-16 18:48:45 In this world view, "sustainability" is the sustainability of the oil industry, not the environment or communities.
2666 2018-04-16 18:48:22 Said it before, I'll say it again: repubs always claim to love the troops.  They don't.  They "love" for them to be in harm's way, lose their healthcare, fight that generation's oil war, but they don't love them as people.
2667 2018-04-16 18:48:18 The lesson of history shows us that America only invades country for the following:
1) Refusing to pay for oil in Petro-Dollar $$
2) Steal Oil
3) Steal Minerals
4) Take over Drugs chain
5) Change leader for one sympathetic to USA - allow USA bases on land.
2668 2018-04-16 18:48:15 IGabriella May16 not in position for usa's,englands carribeans africa, middle east

2669 2018-04-16 18:48:12 they worried you want payment in oil
2670 2018-04-16 18:48:06 The USA are surely just concerned with the oil pipeline they don’t give toss about humanity aid or otherwise
2671 2018-04-16 18:47:52 An abortion advocate complaining about infant mortality is absurd.
2672 2018-04-16 18:47:31 Coconut oil
2673 2018-04-16 18:47:29 That “Dirty dilbit” has been supplying the lower mainland’s gas, jet fuel etc. for decades. California’s oil is dirtier & Nigeria’s is dirtiest of all. Canada buys lots of oil from Nigeria - where’s the outrage? Too busy Vilifying our own industry.
2674 2018-04-16 18:47:23 The absolute fucking state of things in the world at the moment make me sick, China has gone full totalitarian, Russia being as gross as possible to hold onto what little power they actually have, USA putting money into oil when the earth is already in a bad state -

2688 2018-04-16 18:45:18 I don’t understand, I don’t think anyone is supporting Assad.
The point is you just can’t jump into jets and go and bomb anyone for your own ‘interests’ especially as the interests are a slice of oil, water and anything else that’s there.
2689 2018-04-16 18:45:15 Homemade kombucha in place of oil

2691 2018-04-16 18:45:11 Even if they did is bombing the same place going to help people effected buy the chemicals. Does escalating a massive war save lives. Nope I think not. We bombed supposedly for humanitarian need. Not sure how bombing saves lives . Imo lots of nice oil in Syria and land.

2713 2018-04-16 18:42:58 An awesome motorcycle to add to your collection! Collector plate possible, this 1982 BMW RT100 is in great shape, with rebuilt carbs,  fresh oil change, new battery, and more. Clean title, 92k, stk#175999, $9,898
2714 2018-04-16 18:42:49 Come yourself
2715 2018-04-16 18:42:44 I swear getting a oil change so boring lol I hate when I have to take my car
2716 2018-04-16 18:42:38 I need cannabis oil to buy. Any leads?
2717 2018-04-16 18:42:38 so your not-borderline-but-actually-a-mary-sue junko that'll add one more egg to the basket?

even still, despair and "Nero Claudius" still comes off as water and oil. Junko would likely gel with a more  chaotic alignment servant like medusa
2718 2018-04-16 18:42:24 #ANWAR. Period. Just the thought of drilling this pristine land that so many animals depend on for food, migration routes and security. Now picture what this beautiful park will look like when oil platforms and fracking ugliness takes over. Money over beauty?

2724 2018-04-16 18:42:05 Fossil fuel revenues account for 2% of Canada’s GDP and, since oil prices fell below the cost of refining oil from bitumen, that number has been shrinking rapidly. Green energy, which is essentially free after the initial capital costs, is the growth market in the energy sector.
2725 2018-04-16 18:42:04 No, they already got candy and coconut oil stains on the new sheets. RT @Jomo_24: I_Exude_Sarcasm Let them boys have fun lol
2726 2018-04-16 18:42:02 "Military adventures"?!?

What a manipulative use of words. Should of gone with the reality. 

MILITARY INTERVENTIONISM
IMPERIALISM
WAR FOR PROFIT
BLOOD FOR OIL
SANCTIONED MASS MURDERER

All better then calling it cute little adventure stories. Obama wasn't a fairy tale character
2727 2018-04-16 18:41:56 Geo politics counsel, its the ultimate chess. Oil and gas alone wont help
2728 2018-04-16 18:41:41 when DonaldTrump lies, more than one earthling subscibes to the #NYT
2729 2018-04-16 18:41:31 I forgot to add a lil drop of Samsu oil from KingTblak
2730 2018-04-16 18:41:30 So reading this piece I guess the only answer is to stop all additional boat traffic - oil tanker or not - as that is impacting the ecosystem. So I guess we just stop importing any goods from Asia or ship wood etc from these ports as well. Ideally that works but not practical.
2731 2018-04-16 18:41:24 And then death by Oil. 
2732 2018-04-16 18:41:10 You can add to do the flavoring powder and/or seasoning oil.
2733 2018-04-16 18:41:09  listen to th interview ths readily available. dnt base your info on some of these media outlets, that sell snake oil..
2734 2018-04-16 18:41:03 Funny how you just like to list some "liberal" things that are getting subsidies but conveniently don't put the traditional "conservative" and longest running subsidies oil, natural gas, coal, farm exports, corn. Decades for these.
2735 2018-04-16 18:40:56 Bought my shimmering body oil, so i’ll def be glistening in the summer 
2736 2018-04-16 18:40:55 1/ @AB_Enviro has just denied me copies of 3 3rd-party consultant reports they possess, documenting damage to a public stream by a well access road. That damage resulted in conviction of an oil company, & a substantial monetary settlement.
2737 2018-04-16 18:40:52 i was more focused on getting my car to the dealership for an oil change not someone’s missing pipe haha
2738 2018-04-16 18:40:52 completely agree and even more so, 1. you‘d hesitate more to shoot at your customer and 2. why not doing the same thing to oil what they do to gold? soak up physical wherever poasible
2739 2018-04-16 18:40:46 The latest you can leave it to travel through without damage I would say. Will affect yield and oil content, or so I was led to believe.
2740 2018-04-16 18:40:41 not to be dramatic but vitamin e oil changed my skin and u can get it for like $6 at tj maxx from measurable difference in a 4fl oz bottle

2751 2018-04-16 18:39:26 I use one that I got on the spur of the moment from a family Christmas market kind of gig and it's nearly run out. Literally brandless and called 'beard oil' but I loved it. I can't go back to the no-beard-oil lifestyle. Need recommendations
2752 2018-04-16 18:39:09 $XOP up 1.1% today with Oil -1.7% , continues to play catch up
2753 2018-04-16 18:39:06 @cosmic_darling i find indie vegan brands often bring the most affordable offbeat colors, so use those keywords generally? or find what ingredients give the pigment you want and search for that to pat on, ie titanium oxide or cochineal, maybe even mix your own w/ wax and ur oil?
2754 2018-04-16 18:39:02 cod Russia wants an oil pipeline from Saudi through 'Syria' and so do Europe...
2755 2018-04-16 18:38:49 Every political party knew that the tax amnesty granted to the oil companies for investing in the North Sea would end in 1980, and tax revenues from oil exports would rise; whichever party won in 1979 would get to spend it!
2756 2018-04-16 18:38:47 You clearly have no idea what you are talking about for one Obama’s head of the epa was Gina McCarthy who was a environmental health an air quality expert Trumps pick? Scott Pruitt someone famous for suing the EPA for big oil companies
2757 2018-04-16 18:38:35 Two words: Energy Independence 
Never again should we spend American treasure and lives for national security in the Middle East for oil.
2758 2018-04-16 18:38:25 Gotta get an oil change
2759 2018-04-16 18:38:11 1. I live right next to the garage, an oil change wouldn’t even take me 5 minutes. 2. I don’t have a clue what’s happening beneath the hood if that car for me to even claim I’m changing the oil myself 
2760 2018-04-16 18:38:09 IEA World Energy Outlook 2017 reports that fossil fuels still provide 81% of Total Primary Energy Supply (TPES) - coal (27%), oil (32%) and natural gas (22%). Wind power and solar only generate 0.59% and 0.21% of TPES respectively. Don't see much of a "sunset industry".

2765 2018-04-16 18:37:34 Does this also have to do with precious metals and the gold backed yuan/oil trade? Gold and silver bugs have been watching this for a while.

2769 2018-04-16 18:37:15 Yeah, there exists a talent gap where the Oil traded away all those picks in both the 2014 & 2015 Drafts. They got McDavid & Draisaitl obviously, but had no other picks in the first 3 rounds either year. That gap should close sharply in 2018-19.
2770 2018-04-16 18:36:51 They’re just having a pissing contest over the best path for their proposed oil pipeline. All 3 of them: US, UK & Russia. It’s got literally nothing 2 do w/ ethics, humanity or diplomacy. It’s old people, trying 2 prop up a dying industry.
2771 2018-04-16 18:36:46 To where? Asia? That’s what this whole fight is about Blair... selling oil to Asia! Not about a pipeline, not about safely transporting oil, not about creating any meaningful employment outside of the oil patch. It’s all about forcing this on BC for greed!
2772 2018-04-16 18:36:44 Subtle digs at folks who don't change their own oil or bale their own hay.
2773 2018-04-16 18:36:43 @eltatoyoung buenas tardes Tato, 2 cosas que no se hablan del loco del mortero y de cristobal lopez que va a formar una sociedad para comprar oil con nuestra plata. Hasta cuando seremos giles. Lo van a dejar desde el gobierno?

2784 2018-04-16 18:35:29 So people have been getting better and not having to buy medication or opioids because of CBD OIL and now the pharmaceutical companies are trying to take it off the shelf? Disgusting, but this is what happens when the rich buy off politicians. #OverTurnCitizensUnited

2788 2018-04-16 18:35:23 I would’ve thought so. It’s just sugar, condensed milk coconut oil, nut butter and nuts I’m guessing.. Where would the gluten even come from? Never realised that was an issue with fudge as it’s mostly sugar.
2789 2018-04-16 18:35:22 Or it could be that there is something that has interested the government *cough* oil
And if that's the case Israel has broken many UN laws but no action has been taken against them

2804 2018-04-16 18:34:30 Important to highlight growth forecast. R-OPEC is currently engaged in one of largest wealth transfers in history. So nice of them to assist struggling NATO nation oil producers (and indirectly the NATO government tax revenues)
2805 2018-04-16 18:34:29 John the manhole was 14ft depth aswell it felt like someone had swept the floor away from me next minute I’m in The fkn Mersey stinking of fkn oil, you would of collapse with pure laughter I know you as well you would of been in A&E with laughter pains
2806 2018-04-16 18:34:07 @ScottMcConnell9 Then, read that massive crude oil deposit has been found in Israeli-occupied, Syrian territory, Golan Heights. Deposit was found by Israel/US partnership with some heavy hitters on company’s Board, inc. Cheney, Murdoch, Rothschild. See Genie Energy.

2815 2018-04-16 18:32:57 Can anyone answer/explain, please, as I really am curious. Why/how are protestors able to attend protests, of any type? Do they have night jobs? No jobs? If protesting oil, how do they get to the protest site(s)?
2816 2018-04-16 18:32:55 The Canadian government has become a community of snake oil salesmen. Creating more issues, then they are fixing. For their benefit, not ours.
2817 2018-04-16 18:32:40 Same intelligence, by the same people that said , WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION was real?? That was a MI6/CIA Lie. And so is this.
It's all about USA wanting people to distrust the Russians, so the USA can take over supplying oil/gas to Europe + $$$$$ for USA war machine.
2818 2018-04-16 18:32:39 I think the existence of the Royal family severely skewers British politics to the left. The royal family is viewed as completely unjustified wealth. They are not like John Rockefeller who came from poverty made oil cheaper than water and saved the whales.
2819 2018-04-16 18:32:33 lol i don't know. it just said cottonseed oil was used to thicken ice cream.

2822 2018-04-16 18:32:25 Honestly look at the number of EVs produced and the number of vehicles on the road. I agree the transition is coming and is needed but to pretend it will happen anytime soon is simply to dream in technicolor and in the meantime we need to safely transport oil
2823 2018-04-16 18:32:16 No benefit.  what happens when all the oil/bitumen/gas gets turned off from Alberta.

2832 2018-04-16 18:31:19 Wonder what Petroleum & Natural Gas Minister @dpradhanbjp and Rick Perry, Secretary of Energy US can offer more to each other. How abt easy access to indian firms in american shale biz or ending the solar war or discounted American oil/gas?

2834 2018-04-16 18:30:47 The limit of the strike,

2842 2018-04-16 18:30:19 This article fails to address the real question: What top secret information does the Environmental Protection Agency handle?  Does Pruitt really think a tree frog is going to bug his office? More likely he's conspiring against America with oil companies.

2850 2018-04-16 18:30:03 My hair doesn’t produce oil well, so I don’t usually have to wash it often. I just bun it up while showering so it doesn’t go curly again. But this is the best my hair has ever straightened. & it’s my first time straightening it in college!
2851 2018-04-16 18:30:02 He probably owns stock in them. Just like the oil company that he let put their pipeline through at Standing Rock. Also the stock he owns in the companies that make the missiles that he shoots at other countries. Making money every time he makes a decision.

#Syria must have some untapped oil fields.

2861 2018-04-16 18:29:04 The world is a better place. Far more people are prosperous, live longer healthier lives, have better medicine and access to safer food. That all costs MONEY and ENERGY.  The world uses 250M+ BOE of energy DAILY. 2/3 or more is coal, gas or oil based. Rest nuclear, hydro and ..

2863 2018-04-16 18:28:46 Exactly so what’s the issue with tankers in Canadian waters? Foreign oil tankers are in Canadian waters in eastern Canada and is acceptable.
2864 2018-04-16 18:28:46 No need to "take money from military" (although defense budget is absurd). We should not subsidize oil extraction when they make record breaking profits every fiscal quarter. That $$ could fund education or healthcare or sustainable, renewable energy & provide jobs. #Priorities
2865 2018-04-16 18:28:41 Say no to everything they offer. Even if they say it’s critical. Just do the oil.

2873 2018-04-16 18:28:03 Fucking hell, North Dakota, or close enough to it, think before you dig. Oil isn’t all that’s down there. I’ll probably be in Oklahoma for a week next.

2875 2018-04-16 18:27:57 So heres what I've replaced on my caddy. One new tire, New battery, Alternator, new brakes, tune up and replaced number 5 coil, oil changes and people wonder why I have no money and I haven't been west of Chicago. This is why.
2876 2018-04-16 18:27:50  He’s smart. People get distracted by the shirtless pics, but i put up with them because he’s got interesting things to say. I also love how his avi triggers these guys who want to lecture women about being jealous prudes for being bored w cleavage Twitter.

2879 2018-04-16 18:27:28 What product do you suggest for blotting for super oily skin? I have bareminerals pressed powder but it's too damn heavy & cakey and makes my face create even more oil.
2880 2018-04-16 18:27:11 We are ready, we can handle the truth.  I really need to talk with a Blue Avian. So why would we Bomb Syria over oil if X- President Trump knows about this.  Makes no sense! Bring it on!

2883 2018-04-16 18:26:39 Our republic uses democratic principles to elect our representatives. But the fact that a car uses oil and gas doesn’t make it an oil rig.

2885 2018-04-16 18:26:30 And he flies around NY in helicopters, big SUV motorcades, plenty of police protection and could not be more hypocritical about climate change and the oil companies. Only NYC would elect this type of demagogue to be mayor.
2886 2018-04-16 18:26:26 Why did I schedule my oil change in my off day? That bed was too comfortable.
2887 2018-04-16 18:26:17 The lies won't just repeat themselves, you know.
2888 2018-04-16 18:25:59 I assume for the same reason that we need smaller government but also need that smaller government to bailout international oil corporations.
2889 2018-04-16 18:25:53 Vegetable oil causes it?
2890 2018-04-16 18:25:38 Well we should bomb SA because they are the ones pulling the neo-con strings. Syria can drink SA milkshake. The longer Gulf states are destabilized the less SA loses oil to them. Although suggesting as such might get me twitter banned so I will shut up now.
2891 2018-04-16 18:25:36 Controlling the producing of oil worldwide is controlling the petrodollar based economies. What will China do for its petrojuan?

2899 2018-04-16 18:25:09 Over the next year or so we expect about 40 million barrels per day of crude oil—about a trillion dollars per year of transactions—will swing out of dollars into yuan.

2903 2018-04-16 18:24:07 Dear oil companies. The @albertaNDP govt is working really hard to get pipelines built. Every time a leak happens you set us back. Please take the time to check every single fricken centimeter of your pipes!
2904 2018-04-16 18:24:06 Stir in nine gallons of olive oil and whisk briskly.
2905 2018-04-16 18:24:06 coconut oil in my stomach how considerate
2906 2018-04-16 18:23:56 When I use noodles, I cook them for the time in the instructions (4-6 minutes typically), drain. Rinse vigorously under cold water. Then I dress lightly with groundnut oil (rapeseed oil would also work). I keep it aside until needed.
2907 2018-04-16 18:23:51 Ask @michaelgove to put one of those plastic to oil machines in every county council.
2908 2018-04-16 18:23:47 the pride in work + crafting the pipeline seems far more shoddy today w. the many oil spills occurring in US + Canada
2909 2018-04-16 18:23:42 Put some oil in my bath to be nice and relaxing and I’m slipping and sliding all over shop hit my head on side twice already
2910 2018-04-16 18:23:41 Cleaned my car, mailed off my state taxes I owed, got my oil changed, doing homework in a bit, and sleeping before I have to go to work at 11. Being an adult sucks.
2911 2018-04-16 18:23:23 That's because @stephenharper knew that tar sand oil was the most expensive to bring to market and that it was a liability, that's why he was trying to push through unloading tar sands companies to China.
2912 2018-04-16 18:22:57 i use oil of olay facial bar. . . it does cause my skin not to be dry.
2913 2018-04-16 18:22:54 As a vegan but more of a proponent of you and dr Longo how do you convince yourhard core “old school “ counter parts that this is path that makes most sense? Whole food plant based- occasional wild caught pacific  and veg sat fats including olive oil!
2914 2018-04-16 18:22:53 Freedom and democracy mean oil, and human rights mean "when the wrong brown people do a bad thing". So they *are* right
2915 2018-04-16 18:22:47 Grab a few toilet seat covers to cut up into 2-inch squares. These are great for soaking up excess oil on your face.
2916 2018-04-16 18:22:46 I have spent 1hr 47 mins in this hold up

2923 2018-04-16 18:22:13 Glad you caught this @trinafraser.  I get asked all the time why people are selling CBD oil in Canada? I try and explain the difference, but so many people are not educated and are getting taken advantage of!  People are labeling it as CBD oil, but it is not! Shame!
2924 2018-04-16 18:22:11 Another oil boom just round the corner.

2931 2018-04-16 18:21:32 You definitely should! It will help control your oil and it helps a ton with purging.
2932 2018-04-16 18:21:20 Scams are out there for sure, most common selling Hemp oil for $45-60 implies CBD content but it’s the FDA/DEA quagmire in the states that fostered this swicharoo, which will be resolved soon thanks to their proposed US farm Bill
2933 2018-04-16 18:21:14 Bad news and good news: the bad news is it turns out having a holiday from trumpet practice over Easter is not a good plan, the good news is Miss Heywood can apply valve oil all by herself!

2937 2018-04-16 18:20:46 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
2938 2018-04-16 18:20:33 I mostly agree, but oh my Lord what a circus Congress makes of these things. The speeches about WWIII, "it's all for oil (?)", and why don't we go somewhere else first, whataboutism galore, the usual Trump Derangement from CNN & MSNBC...at some point the Executive must act.

These things go together like hammers and unicorns

2951 2018-04-16 18:18:23 Moving right along, @FloridaCRC votes 33-3 to ban oil and gas exploration on state waters while also banning vaping in indoor workspaces.
2952 2018-04-16 18:18:16 Everyone knew this was all smoke and mirrors. She has no intention of shutting off oil.
2953 2018-04-16 18:18:03 Argentinas, I love to accompany it with nice Garlic, olive oil, salt, thin lightly grilled lamb chops...
2954 2018-04-16 18:18:01 Sweden seems to be doing fine under socialism. Funny how the economy tanked in Venezuela with the price of oil.
2955 2018-04-16 18:18:00 “General Electric”, “General Motors”, “Standard Oil”, “ITT”, “Hugo Boss”, “Kodak”, “Coca Cola”(Fanta was produced specially for nazi Germany), “IBM”, “Random House” and few else companies worked with NAZI Germany before WW2 and during the war....it is strange if you don’t know
2956 2018-04-16 18:17:54 I hated it no lie. Tooo thick, no slip. Not something you can use often. And if you don’t get it out properly your hair gon be lookin dull and feelin sticky  and it’s harder to get out the more textured your hair is. 
Like I dunked my hair in coconut oil to clean it out.

2962 2018-04-16 18:16:27 What I love about FRFS/GIFA is that there are so many catalysts that could snowball upon name/symbol change. Billions in loans......Oil Refineries.....National Airlines.......and gaming Casinos. Could hit $50 per share quite easily. V Hestheman
2963 2018-04-16 18:16:26 WTI is currently at ~$60/barrel USF, it means oil companies actually receive ~$80 equivalent Canadian. It trades in USF so is paid in USF. It’s a benefit to us that crude trades on their dollar. I don’t need to show you, everyone in our industry knows. It’s an Alberta thing.

2971 2018-04-16 18:15:37 Whatever. Usually olive oil but butter is good too (keto). I like them a little crisp? Like on the outside layers.

2979 2018-04-16 18:14:56 Of course they were forwarned. Trump doesnt want to piss off Putin. He owes him "millions and millions" of dollars.
What I really want to know is why no mention is made by televised news that this is all because of, and started because of, the oil pipeline.
2980 2018-04-16 18:14:43 Trudeau says he opposes the use of chemical weapons. What does he think of his 50 year plan to pump poisons (oil) we don't need? Sounds like he may even get the taxpayers to subsidize it even more than we already do.
2981 2018-04-16 18:14:41 He doesn’t know! 
2982 2018-04-16 18:14:29 Seriously some people think yoga will solve every problem. The amount of times I say something feels off and someone says “you should try yoga” is out of hand. What if I lather myself in coconut oil AND do yoga?! Will I become immortal??
2983 2018-04-16 18:14:21 Told my husband’s “health nut” bff that coconut oil isn’t healthy & he got up & walked away from me. 
2984 2018-04-16 18:14:14 Syria... a nice pipeline from Saudi Arabia and Qatar to Europe.. Iran is Shiite, Saudi Arabia is Sunni as well as Qatar .. Russia sells oil to Europe. Connect the dots. The US and Russia could care less about chemical attacks and children. Follow the money..
2985 2018-04-16 18:14:13 2 large spuds grated, squeeze the juice out. 
Chopped meat or no meat.
1 small onion.
Handful of chopped shrooms.
2 small garlic cloves.
2 tsp of paprika
Pinch of chilli powder.
1 egg
Mix together, add flower until slightly gloopy. 
Shallow fry in coconut oil.
2986 2018-04-16 18:14:10 New part at cost, but comped labor and free oil change (which we needed anyway).
2987 2018-04-16 18:14:04 One of the reasons the US wants to control the oil is because profits flow back & they flow in a lot of ways. Its not just oil profits, it's also military sales. The biggest purchaser of US arms & probably British arms is either Saudi Arabia or UAE, one of the rich oil producers
2988 2018-04-16 18:13:59 Try pouring essence of mint essential oil from @younglivingeo on the servers. If that doesn’t work, try witchhazel. Big Pharma doesn’t want you to know, but my sister’s co-workers mom had malware once. 2 days of essential oils and it was gone. Doctors couldn’t explain it.
2989 2018-04-16 18:13:49 Some oil perhaps, boiling preferably

2991 2018-04-16 18:13:30 Here in southwest Virginia, when a tornado brings down trees and destroys property, it's a state of emergency. When an oil company does it, it's eminent domain. @RalphNortham
2992 2018-04-16 18:13:26 Great news - I am really impressed by @IcelandFoods lately, making a stand in respect of both palm oil and plastics. Supermarkets need to be part of the solution and not part of the problem - let's hope others follow!
2993 2018-04-16 18:13:24 This Saturday we rocking with the QUE 

Biggest party of the year ...the “OIL SPILL” 

Early arrival suggested 

Doors open at 10 pm.. Fairgrounds 
@Davinci615
2994 2018-04-16 18:13:08 Cohen has all Trumps sexual encounters gone wrong,shady real estate with Russia and others maybe shady oil deals of course this is just a guess ?
2995 2018-04-16 18:12:55 bitch thats oil
2996 2018-04-16 18:12:54 You do realize that BC is powered by publicly-owned BC Hydro and has been for generations, no? Not by Alberta oil and any pipeline through BC for China is not for you or for any Canadian, at all.
2997 2018-04-16 18:12:48 I tried that baby oil + crushed highlighter mix thing yesterday. Its not Fenty Lava, but it works.
2998 2018-04-16 18:12:48 Can we put oil on the top lane so nobody can run there? I LOVE OLD BRISTOL! NOT RIDE THE WALL BRISTOL!
2999 2018-04-16 18:12:42 I don’t use it all the time I use coconut oil. It’s good for teeth protection
3000 2018-04-16 18:12:26 Oceans don’t understand which is US or Canada the oil spill everyone is worried about will go where the current takes it. Get real pls!
3001 2018-04-16 18:12:21 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!
3002 2018-04-16 18:12:19 Took my car in for an oil change. Found out so much more is wrong with it 
3003 2018-04-16 18:12:17 I LOVE OIL, AND BURNING OIL FOR ENERGY
3004 2018-04-16 18:12:13 How is hit ‘em up not number one? 
3005 2018-04-16 18:12:03 Thanks Debbie Downer.....lol   Other sad & morbid thoughts:  their decaying remains is what we're putting into our gas tanks right now. Every oil deposit is a life form, drained, distilled, sold and burned as fuel. How cruel we all are as a species to process & burn this as fuel.
3006 2018-04-16 18:11:54 The kind that goes into dismantling the BIG PHARMA combine and promotes open CBD oil research in cancer cures #MedicalCannabis #BigPharmaKills
3007 2018-04-16 18:11:44 @BBCTheOneShow I agree that disposable plastics are a massive issue. Why is the issue of Palm Oil (used in millions of everyday items/foods) which is causing the destruction of Orangutan habitat being ignored by the masses? 
3008 2018-04-16 18:11:43 It’s good to regularly change the oil - hope the rain doesn’t last to long Joanie - due to rain here tonight - get the brolly out 
3009 2018-04-16 18:11:39 Is there regulations that say you must put the concentration of CBD oil on the product? Or where would I find details on this?
3010 2018-04-16 18:11:33 So I'm going to straighten my hair after using my African Herbal Oil... Any suggestions peeps?? @CurlyProbs
3011 2018-04-16 18:11:26 The US does realize, one hopes, that the UK is going to win best positioning for that oil pipeline through Syria, then? The English won’t stand for anything less, & the US has lost their clout to demand otherwise.
3012 2018-04-16 18:11:22 How is this not common sentiment among all Americans not deep in the pockets of oil interests or the government establishment? Patriots and pacifists alike should be hearing this and educating themselves and ridiculing their elected officials for allowing this to go on.
3013 2018-04-16 18:11:16 The cost of oil tanker transport is going up exponentially as the International Marine Org (IMO) brings in low carbon/sulphur fuel regs for oil tanker ships. Currently the crude to diesel spread is $118. Now it is more profitable for Canadian refineries to operate.
3014 2018-04-16 18:11:07 calf muscles finna look good might put a lil oil on em for a shine
3015 2018-04-16 18:11:02 Mama, they are here selling oil, more than they preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
3016 2018-04-16 18:10:59 As Earth Week begins here's a little reminder of the virtues of public transit...

• Helps to reduce the nation’s dependence on foreign oil
• Lessens our impact on the environment
• Stimulates economic growth and development by creating “green jobs”
3017 2018-04-16 18:10:53 Yea I said I look like an oil tycoon lmaooo
3018 2018-04-16 18:10:44 *Tsu’s Oil spill*

3020 2018-04-16 18:10:37 I put baby oil in my beard and on my head this morning                        HAPPY MONDAY!!!
3021 2018-04-16 18:10:30 Sorry Stan, but BS.
The fact that we can't sell Alberta oil to any-one but the US is not the AB gov fault, past or present. Full value for the resource can ONLY be had by selling on the world market. And that is the LONG term solution.
3022 2018-04-16 18:10:26 Hey guys. The Press Box at Lucas Oil, pretty cool even though @NarcHigdon didn’t have any food up there. 
3023 2018-04-16 18:10:23 See just lemme
3024 2018-04-16 18:10:23 Tea Tree oil is best for oily/combo skin as it can dry out your skin, causing your skin to overproduce oils!
3025 2018-04-16 18:10:23 Yes that's a tough one. Oil have a think about it.

3032 2018-04-16 18:10:09 Jeremy Corbyn as PM would tackle issues at the source.

JC would deprive ISIS type mercenaries (incl. those UK supports) of fund-raising, weapons & oil revenue!

As a human rights campaigner, he would get a more receptive response.

His patient diplomacy would help achieve peace!

3035 2018-04-16 18:09:50 He’s talking about the new oil and gas pipeline hat is planned for Syria. That’s all mate. He’s up on current affairs
3036 2018-04-16 18:09:42 Wait until they find out about oil & gas companies. They’ll implode.
3037 2018-04-16 18:09:41 UPDATE: Had to come in for a broken oil line. Working against the clock to repair. #WeAreFurnitureRow #NASCAR
3038 2018-04-16 18:09:38 I'd prefer using trucks (jobs too) since we least know - if a spill occurs- the exact amount spilled vs tonnes oil + toxic water leaking f. how long fr. a pipe
3039 2018-04-16 18:09:38 Why trade one war loving party that loves fracking, pipelines & oil spills w/ a party that loves the same oligarchs? Only the #GreenParty & @DrJillStein had a plan to end the wars for oil, stop the war on drugs & people of color + set a generation free from predatory loans.
3040 2018-04-16 18:09:34 Kinda feel bad when i put oil in my room tbh.
3041 2018-04-16 18:09:28 At 2:05pm I got a correlation sell signal for the Crude Oil WTI Futures (CLM18) and USO on my software.
3042 2018-04-16 18:09:26 Did they find oil in there?
3043 2018-04-16 18:09:21 @RumsfeldOffice Is this the truth? Are we in conflict with Syria to keep oil from being sold by Russians/Iranians. Is the value of the USD the cause for this never ending war. #SyriaStrike #Syria #Siria
3044 2018-04-16 18:08:48 Pipelines is looking to the future and not the past.   We need to get oil to market to produce our plastics, we need to use funds from taxation to reinvest,  in AB we should be looking at turning dry oil wells into geothermal energy places.
3045 2018-04-16 18:08:42 Ah. I see you're a little touchy about the essential oil/MLM thing as well...@DrAricSudicky
3046 2018-04-16 18:08:37 It's a crying shame. People need to be educated about the plight of Orangutans. Palm oil is in so many products in supermarkets. That means big $€£¥, for large companies. It's not too late; there's always a solution. Thanks for posting. It's a start!
3047 2018-04-16 18:08:31 @OregonGovBrown: Regarding off shore drilling. Science has exposed a potential link between extensive oil extraction from under the ocean floor & aquatic warming.  It is believed that such can increase the normal rate & volume of thermal energy being transferred into the waters.
3048 2018-04-16 18:08:27 There are clowns everywhere.. Rick only has over 5000 testimonials of how his tears oil has helped or cured them. Can't fix stupid sometimes!
3049 2018-04-16 18:08:25 We need to speed up Cyril’s downfall. That guy is poison on oil. #Cyrilmustfall
3050 2018-04-16 18:08:25 The oil companies govern it, the treasury get the little tax income from the profits because the SNP went cap on hand to ask WM to give the oil industry tax relief to keep it afloat.
3051 2018-04-16 18:08:14 well the very same article stated that most environmental scientists believe it is us that are causing it. now who put worthless studies out before to muddle facts? oh ya it was the oil company's with led back in the 70's. saying leAd was harmless.
3052 2018-04-16 18:08:05 @AsSeenOnTV your big boss oil less fryer died a few months months in use and no one will acknowledge the year warranty, solutions?
3053 2018-04-16 18:07:59 Apparently broken for some time - how long has Alberta been trying to build pipes to move oil?
3054 2018-04-16 18:07:49 #bbconeshow @michaelgove why get rid of plastic it’s just oil use it then burn it and take energy out of it again for electric generation don’t dump it

3056 2018-04-16 18:07:44 I got joints vs oil vape in the final
3057 2018-04-16 18:07:34 I drenched my hair in coconut oil because i get it bleached tomorrow and had to wash it this morning because i still had chlorine in my hair from when i went swimming last friday i‘m actually really unhygienic but it’s safe to blame on the depression just thought i‘d let u know
3058 2018-04-16 18:07:24 Yup. Just like oil companies passing on their tax cut to the prices at the pump... Oh the highest in 3 years. I mean increased jobs...unemployment stagnation...at least the GOP fixed the deficit... Damn. Uh what did you all accomplish again?
3059 2018-04-16 18:07:21 There sure are a lot of people who no longer need snake oil that miss their snake oil salesaman. #nobama #peopleneedsmoothtalk
3060 2018-04-16 18:07:10 who’s tryna be my sugar daddy so i can get my oil changed/tires filled/rotated so i can drive and see my mom this week because i’m fucking depressed!!!
3061 2018-04-16 18:07:04 That he quickly after that suggested he would stay if the Arabs chipped in? And he would "keep the oil" and complained that the US was not getting anything out of the war? Sounds like it all was simply a business deal.
3062 2018-04-16 18:06:55 We bombed Iraq, we bombed Libya. Left both countries in terrible states and American companies came in and took over oil production leaving the people with nothing. Remember the Lybian suicide bomber at the Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena? Do you want more of that?
3063 2018-04-16 18:06:54 The no.7 oil drops and night cream omg they are a GOD send!! Xx
3064 2018-04-16 18:06:48 Met this Italian girl and after 5 minutes of talkin about garlic bread I was ready to pack my bags and start a new life in Italy making olive oil or some shit.
3065 2018-04-16 18:06:48 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines
3066 2018-04-16 18:06:31 We shouldn’t put Kinder Morgan shareholder concerns and the greed to sell oil to Asia as being more important than confederation, BC’s legitimate environmental concerns with their environment and indigenous rights over their environment.
3067 2018-04-16 18:06:28 Iif you stood with oil workers you would hav done something as soon as Horgan got in power, but maybe your plan al along was to nationalize the oil industry, more money in your slush fund and more control over Candians. Your father tried that and it failed !
3068 2018-04-16 18:06:19 Oil execs, chemical companies, big pharma, construction firms. He probably had another dead line number he handed out to park services, animal activists, scientists, and the press.

3073 2018-04-16 18:06:06 I haven’t used actual oil but I shampoo infrequently and never rinse out all the conditioner
3074 2018-04-16 18:06:05 There's little chance Western oil and gas companies will return to Syria's economy, which needs billions of dollars in restoration, a Russian delegate said.
3075 2018-04-16 18:06:03 @Comey Did you here any of Obama's lies on Obama are? A snake oil salesman wouldn't have lied that often and not be jailed.
3076 2018-04-16 18:05:55 Maybe “stain” is the wrong word to use here.
3077 2018-04-16 18:05:55 Ramen has lots of oil so I don't really like it.

3087 2018-04-16 18:04:40 Ryan is in the pockets of Big Oil and the Arabs... did we expect him to represent us?
3088 2018-04-16 18:04:30 What about having a separate "thank you" business card that also had a coupon for a free oil change or car detail on the back?
3089 2018-04-16 18:04:27 There's another distinction - Muesli is raw with no oil or sugar added, granola is sweetened, oil is added and it is baked.

3097 2018-04-16 18:03:36 Dr Michael Gregor in his groundbreaking book "How Not To Die" recommends eliminating all meat, fish, dairy, eggs, and oil from your diet, limiting salt intake to 1.5g per day (2 slices of bread has 1.6g) and says we should be aiming for 1 hour of exercise - every day

3108 2018-04-16 18:02:20 Hehehehe... Just compare the oil revenue during his 8yr dictatorship with the so called projected highlighted above. You will see that u are part of the lot being deceived by this political looters!!

3111 2018-04-16 18:01:56 Rose hip oil is the best thing to have ever happened to my face. Today is the first day since I was a young teenager that I didn't feel the need to wear heavy foundation
3112 2018-04-16 18:01:53 Obama is a shapeshifting reptile and a reptile cannot be an American citizen! ABC’s Lost was a secret documentary! It’s all true! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
3113 2018-04-16 18:01:51 Thats terrible!! I had my car in back in the fall to get my window looked at and a ticking noise in the heater addressed. Sure enough they got my tires and oil done but the window guy didnt have time to look at that, and the heater didnt make the noise. Trying again now next week

3115 2018-04-16 18:01:49 Actually it's a huge ripoff. Printer ink costs more than oil, when it only costs cents to produce.

3121 2018-04-16 18:01:24 The NOPA crush report for March 2018 at 171.9 million bushels was about 3 million bushels greater than average trade expectations. Despite the larger than expected crush, soybean oil stocks at 1946 million pounds were largely in line

3124 2018-04-16 18:01:19 Exaggerating the risk is not helpful. Pipelines are the safest way to move oil which will be needed for a very long time. The T mM project was fully assessed before being approved by Trudeau and the NEB. For some, any assessment that doesn't terminate is unsatisfactory. Too bad.

3126 2018-04-16 18:01:17 “Es un error pensar que al ser una piel grasa no necesita hidratación. Sin hidratación la cara necesitará más sebo. Por tanto, hay que hacer uso de una crema hidratante especial que no tenga una base oleosa para no aumentar el brillo. Oil free y no Comedogénica”

3148 2018-04-16 17:59:34 Aren’t they all in it together? That’s what Syria is about—a global pissing contest over who will get the best path for their oil pipeline. Old people trying to prop up a dying industry, when it’s all boiled down.

3150 2018-04-16 17:59:32 The shipping of oil by oil tanker through BC waters risks far more jobs than it would ever create and no one can show any real evidence that it creates any permanent employment outside of the oil patch(s) especially in BC where most of the risk is being forced upon! #bcpoli

3152 2018-04-16 17:58:58 The Russians don't need to do any of that. All they have to do is support republicans that want to do away with all the EPA's rules. #Flint, Michigan still has no clean water & there are a bunch of water supplies that are contaminated by broken oil pipelines.

3172 2018-04-16 17:56:25 Investing on renewable energie will create 10 times more jobs and save the planet. Investing in oil is a short term view. On the long term it will cost billions and destroy the planet.
3173 2018-04-16 17:56:24 Oil is a very complicated affair especially to countries that just discovered it. Example is Ghana. Look at Nigeria and Angola. Kenya is going the same beaten path.
3174 2018-04-16 17:56:05 Almond oil is the most moisturizing, to the point that I have to be really careful not to overdo it.
3175 2018-04-16 17:56:01 Your point is well taken, but you can't easily select your gas by the origin of its oil or just never buy gas. We can only consume according to our values where we're able. But yes, said activist should be aware and could do things like lobby for rules on oil sources, etc

chop sweet potato and boil for about 15 minutes in 1 pan (they won't fit in the main one)

finely chop onion and garlic, sweat in a fair amout of ghee/butter/dairyfree alternative and oil 

add spices, fry for a few minutes
3179 2018-04-16 17:55:28 Oil is used primarily for transportation, renewables provide electricity so your argument doesn’t make much sense you are conflating two different arguments

3182 2018-04-16 17:55:12 If we refine the oil at Fort McMurray it would provide many Canadian jobs and less opposition if it was refined oil and not bitumen in those pipes which no one knows how to clean in a spill.

3193 2018-04-16 17:54:18 It makes sense to monetize one's natural advantage. Would you prefer Germany's electricity rates that are QUADRUPLE TO QUINTUPLE what we pay here as they have almost no oil or gas, or $3/liter of gas ? Plus GST+PST at 20% ?
3194 2018-04-16 17:54:16 Should Canadian political parties be bankrolled by giant US oil corporations?

How about Canadian "grassroots" movements and non-profits? Should they be bankrolled by giant US Oil & Pipeline corporations?

What if they are, Elizabeth?
Does it change things?
3195 2018-04-16 17:54:09 Shit yea. Like cars. They depreciate soon as you drive em off the lot. If you're lucky and get the oil changed enough, maybe you can keep them for a long time.
3196 2018-04-16 17:53:49 Trail runners and those who love and respect the land we have! It’s appalling they are so willing to give away lands to be adulterated by gas and oil companies

3205 2018-04-16 17:52:39 This chart is not all that relevant. Frankly it’s kinda horrifying and shows how far we need to go. Coal should be gone and oil should be reserved for applications like cars where it’s really needed for now.

3221 2018-04-16 17:51:10 Yeah I get that, but the way I view the world is different. Oil will be around for your lifetime, probably mine, but it will eventually be gone. Our government pulls all this money out to invest in oil. It just would make more sense to me to invest in
3222 2018-04-16 17:51:09 because anyone who doesn't think our hot new evidence-free oil war is a good idea is a Russian troll

3225 2018-04-16 17:50:41 Are you serious?  You really believe our politicians set the price of oil? No wonder you are so ill-informed if you believe that.
3226 2018-04-16 17:50:27 no one is pretending we don't use oil and gas. The problem is is that we have no choice but to use it. If we stop investing in oil and gas it will pave the way for renewable's to become more prominent in our market. I am sorry but under your mindset we would never transition.

3233 2018-04-16 17:49:44 We need a national #EnergyCorridor which carries oil, gas & electricity E-to-W. Canada is a major energy producer but we squabble too much interprovincially. We could ship electricity back from NL, NB or PQ to AB or SK at different peak times & ship BC hydro or AB wind/solar east

Run out of oil, that's funny!
Since he said that we haven't made a dent in the oil supply, although we use 100 x's more, nor have we found anything that compares (energy wise) with it.
The sun & wind energies are great, if it's always sunny and windy.

3237 2018-04-16 17:48:55 Sorry, no. Current pipelines are at maximum volumes, so oil is being shipped by rail, which then bumps grain & other commodities. This is a huge problem for our farmers.  We need not only TM pipeline, but expansion of others as well.
3238 2018-04-16 17:48:45 You don't actually need to hear what he is saying, you can just follow the trail of oil he leaves behind wherever he goes.
3239 2018-04-16 17:48:31 I came from AB. Regular people who worked in the tar sands like my brothers were conscious enough of the environmental impacts that they retrained & got out, so they didn't feel shamed before their own kids and future grandkids about the horrid legacy of oil extraction. Retrain!

Chesapeak es puro shale oil creo... ya sabéis todos lo poco que me gusta eso :(
3242 2018-04-16 17:48:08 I believe that part of the motivation is oil but also there is I think a deep seated, Christianity based, hatred for Islam and muslims. 21st century crusades
3243 2018-04-16 17:48:00 Check the source if the fish oil.  Most is highly watered down with soybean oil which contributes to many health problems.
3244 2018-04-16 17:47:50 We will have to accept phasing out Fossil Fuels&converting to Cleaner Alt Fuels, But it will be worth it to save our Earth. So much clean up has too be performed behind 150 years of using dirty Earth/human Killing Oil, Gas & Coal.
3245 2018-04-16 17:47:46 LYING BACKSTUDS its doing it to please the USA Corporations cos they want there hands on the gas pipeline & the oil in the middle east & will not stop there warmongering until they have got them
3246 2018-04-16 17:47:39 I dunno...Olive Oil is pretty essential around my place....
3247 2018-04-16 17:47:37 So boom go on eBay and buy some mica powders for like $2 and baby oil and you cool sis. fuck all that lotion and breaking highlighters shit
3248 2018-04-16 17:47:36 Adam, when are you shorting oil?
3249 2018-04-16 17:47:14 Cute except for the actual reality that oil production is the highest it has ever been. I don't see anything hampering the growth in the industry
3250 2018-04-16 17:47:07 We have a deliciously refreshing sandwich as our special today!

Smoked turkey, fresh cucumbers, olive tapenade, and a lemon-mint cream cheese, on a toasted ciabatta, with mixed greens, tomatoes, and olive oil.
3251 2018-04-16 17:47:06 Haha but is still tasted like olive oil right?
3252 2018-04-16 17:47:01 So yeah. Corn, broccoli, tomatoes, lime juice, carrot if you find some, olive oil and a good pinch of salt. That's what I'd go for
3253 2018-04-16 17:46:50 Karachi has the best biryani. However, use of quality ingredients is not guaranteed. In Punjab many call pulao the biryani. There is a big difference in taste of biryani b/w Karachi & North America. The diff is due to missing ingredients - sweat of cook, used oil and others.
3254 2018-04-16 17:46:45 Especially if you played games like ballgag karaoke or you did things like oil your feet.  Or modelled high heels or tied yourself up.
3255 2018-04-16 17:46:28 Why are these fools fighting for oil? It’s yesterday’s fuel.
3256 2018-04-16 17:46:14 I do NOT hate Trump or his supporters I hate What Trump stands for? 1- GREED 2- his own interests 3- deregulation of laws that protect us 4- tax breaks for himself and the rich 5- Oil lover and polluter 6- privatization 7- monopolies 8- other corrupted politicians
3257 2018-04-16 17:46:10 I'm officially embarrassed to have moved to BC, you want lower gas prices but don't want oil? Seems like you know what you're doing...
3258 2018-04-16 17:46:09 Sure, sodium bisulfite can be added to keep that fresh-looking color – we've also used it in our celery juice and basil oil! But if you don't have that in the pantry (surprise, surprise), there are definitely alternative solutions. Thanks for the question!
3259 2018-04-16 17:46:01 Do oligarchs and millionaires run both parties? Do lobbyists for oil companies and defense contractors call the shots no matter who is in power? Biden, the credit card senator, undercut Harry Reid in the W Bush tax cut renewal negotiations. He set the tax increase level at 450ķ.
3260 2018-04-16 17:45:57 go get ur fking bio oil

3262 2018-04-16 17:45:53 I was in the hospital for 3 months because my doctor gave me anti depressants and anti anxiety meds that did not agree with me. I recently got an ACMPR license and started using flower with High CBD and oil and I'm not ever going back to chemical medication.
3263 2018-04-16 17:45:52 USA is perfectly capable of buying oil if they have need for it — which they don’t.
3264 2018-04-16 17:45:45 Olive oil naturally solidifies at cold temp. It usually becomes cloudy and thick and oh well, jelly like. Not sure what happens when you eat it afterwards though (I was put off to try it out)
3265 2018-04-16 17:45:45 The Oil industry isn’t subsidized in the way people think. And right now, with the US as our only customer, we aren’t getting world market price, this translates into over 7 billion/year in lost revenue. The US makes a ton of money buying & selling CDN oil.
3266 2018-04-16 17:45:37 Why do you think we are bomb8ng syria its to remove assad to instal an oil pipeline. Literally the only reason ww3 is about to start is because itll be good for the western economies
3267 2018-04-16 17:45:35 @AJENews Sudanese awarded the International Socrates Award ‘Best enterprise and Manager of the year’ by (Europe Business Assembly) Business Leaders summit 2014 ,Oxford,UK. Mr.Ghandi Moutasim ,Managing Director of Asawer Oil&Gas is now in detention! Why??#كلنا_غاندي_معتصم

3270 2018-04-16 17:45:18 The dude at the campsite next to us basically spent the whole day in baby oil but I wasn't complaining.
3271 2018-04-16 17:45:06 Plant oils like coconut oil and cocoa butter found to help symptoms of Crohn's disease bc they reduce bad bacteria in gut. Looking for a non-dairy chocolate sauce recipe that uses cocoa butter for my son who has symptoms.
3272 2018-04-16 17:45:04 It’s soooo good. It’s just really tough so u gotta massage it in olive oil & lemon so the fibers break down. Imma make u a kale salad & ur gonna love it!! Ppl don’t kno how to prepare it correctly
3273 2018-04-16 17:44:53 Funny that.. For all the ranting about eastern Canada importing oil why is Nfld not supplying the east instead of their oil going to the US to be sold back to us?
3274 2018-04-16 17:44:50 It’s my goal to start putting coconut oil in my hair several times a week.
3275 2018-04-16 17:44:38 Go to get just an oil change and they be tryna find everything wrong with ya car when nothing be wrong 
3276 2018-04-16 17:44:37 I’m not sure. I get free oil changes for the life of my car at the Honda dealership so I go there.
3277 2018-04-16 17:44:18 tbs tea tree oil
3278 2018-04-16 17:44:02 Extra virgin Olive oil , because these other ones have been around the block.

3284 2018-04-16 17:43:28 [Eternal-ism] ...plugs 'x' into an eternal scenario, as Timothy Snyder says. The public relations side operates the tactic of fact-spinning producing traction toward 'x'.

3285 2018-04-16 17:43:13 i'm so sick of the smell of tea tree oil
3286 2018-04-16 17:43:12 hmm, true + 'way of life' does not include being forced to live thru oil spills - recent + past spills should provide enough info to allow BC to have harsh $$ penalties + compensation to BC citizens esp. if being forced to hv pipeline
3287 2018-04-16 17:43:07 Oil corporations employ people, you understand that, right? Investments into equipment pays federal GST. Corporations pay income taxes AND pay CPP, EI and personal income taxes for all their workers. Money for education does not grow on trees. It has to be earned by corporations.
3288 2018-04-16 17:42:58 It's all such a bloody mess, literally. So sad and yes, all over oil and a pipeline with may big egos thrown in for good measure and at the cost of many many lives.
3289 2018-04-16 17:42:53 Please does coconut oil darken the skin???
3290 2018-04-16 17:42:50 Real talk: i feel like a stinky jerkbeast whenever i heat up a dish containing fish oil at the office. Tastes great, but smell reminds me of an unclean human.
3291 2018-04-16 17:42:49 Thankyou Alberta for all your equalization money and for bailing out Bombardier but we don't like your oil so we will buy from Saudi Arabia cause they don't have carbon tax.
3292 2018-04-16 17:42:29 Yep, maybe we should have let Norway control our Oil, they would have done a better job than WM but not as good a job as we would do ourselves.
3293 2018-04-16 17:42:27 @calminthecut Sounds like a plan! Have you taken care of the oil change?

3296 2018-04-16 17:42:12 Did Pruitt authorize it himself? Why would he need a soundproof phone booth in his office? Which oil, gas and coal tycoons is he making deals with?
3297 2018-04-16 17:42:05 why doesnt montclair offer oil wrestling as a gym credit
3298 2018-04-16 17:42:02 Just to inform you if its oil insulated it is probably 33kV. Your yellow insulation tape is rated for 600V.
3299 2018-04-16 17:41:47 the rest of this interview is hilarious @consciousflesh. he says he wants to stop the race war and instead suicide bomb oil refineries in long beach for the environment.
3300 2018-04-16 17:41:39 Cbd oil really helps me!

3303 2018-04-16 17:41:21 I'm being inundated with sweet smells... from the almond oil on my dreadlocs and the cherry-scented lip balm. It's a bit much. 
3304 2018-04-16 17:41:18 Father teach me wisdom:-

Faith & Logic....like oil in water - cannot combine.

   Faith does not have a reserved seating accommodation for logic.

 As logic does not have the capacity to hold a seat in the realm of faith.~P.B
3305 2018-04-16 17:41:10 The "intelligence" claims a government  helicopter was seen near to the scene, very odd considering there is a war in that area. A barrel bomb was seen on a roof. Really? Its an oil barrel stuffed with C4 there would be nothing left of the barrel, the roof, and anyone close by.

3309 2018-04-16 17:40:54 Well fuck the oil change. I waited 10 mins just to get in the garage. 

Tomorrow it is then.
3310 2018-04-16 17:40:53 Y'all should Google up How "Ketchup" is NO Good for You. 

I've been reading reports of toxic  synthetic GMO soybean oil being major ingredient and other highly acidic chemicals.
3311 2018-04-16 17:40:53 I'm a Muslim, foreign meddling in the Middle East upsets me. Especially when it's over proxy wars, oil and more importantly killing my innocent brothers and sisters in Islam.
3312 2018-04-16 17:40:44 lot of #oil stocks doing well today despite oil down today.  BULLISH
3313 2018-04-16 17:40:35 It’s cannabis/hemp oil which is legal everywhere
3314 2018-04-16 17:40:31 SYRIA, A FACTUAL RANT THREAD. 

Planned oil pipeline from Iran through Syria to the coast would allow for Iran to sell their oil which the US and their fuckbuddy’s do not want. Russia is backing Iran because they want to see Iranian oil sold in the market.
3315 2018-04-16 17:40:30 You’re not a real Italian unless you’ve used olive oil as lube.
3316 2018-04-16 17:40:28 すっかりバルカロールも寒くなったなー。へくしっ
3317 2018-04-16 17:40:27 Crisp up some garlic in oil, toss the lentils in olive oil and go wild. Add  beet root, cucumber, tomato, red onion, balsamic, goat cheese, feta, celery, carrots; depends on what you have.
3318 2018-04-16 17:40:26 That’s not the point I’m arguing, and neither was it yours initially. But thanks for the history lesson. I’m aware times change. My assertion is that oil is too useful, too available and too profitable to die soon. 50-100 years. Until then, maintain infrastructure.
3319 2018-04-16 17:40:16 , is on it rocks in the oil over there is not worth it
3320 2018-04-16 17:40:15 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
3321 2018-04-16 17:40:08 Water bongs, blunts, gummies, THC oil
3322 2018-04-16 17:40:04 It's so hard to know what the truth is, but after Iraq & Libya, we have to question it. Both times Trump said he was pulling troops out, there's a chemical attack & we stay. Iran can't be in Syria bc of Israel. There's also the pipeline & oil rights. see China petro-yuan.
3323 2018-04-16 17:40:01 I am all for it those s,o,b need to take a financial hit. They are polluting society with there thinking and as a oil company. They are the swamp.

3325 2018-04-16 17:39:54 Aye, especially considering the fact @EPAScottPruitt was using it to undermine the @EPA, and trying to cover up the fact (from government oversight and law enforcement)  that he was using it to contact his kindred spirits (Lobbyists & Executives) of Big Oil... 
3326 2018-04-16 17:39:53 try a breathe strip and some lavender oil around your nostrils
3327 2018-04-16 17:39:48 I think BC doesnt matter anymore. Its national sentiment now. Particularly Qc. Bc never really matters when it comes to poli in Ottawa. Just like Alberta. But if this spins out of control, people get hurt at protests, arrests, all under the narrative of the feds pushing oil...
3328 2018-04-16 17:39:46 Today in microbiology I am testing Thieves Essential oil in its effectiveness in killing E. coli. We shall see if this stuff really works
3329 2018-04-16 17:39:41 I’ve been burn by an iron, hot gravy splashing in my face, the stove, hot pans, but I have to say being burned by hot cooking oil is the fucking worst

3333 2018-04-16 17:39:25 there's a youtube piece I've seen recently  on the great oil robery but don't have the reference - it was how westminster kept the secret and had plans for projects such as the m25
3334 2018-04-16 17:39:13 Dear friends! Ask @narendramodi @AmitShah and @dpradhanbjp to do something fast to reduce oil prices or else it will definitely puncture your poll prospects. Please don't take common man for a ride.
3335 2018-04-16 17:39:07 I swear my face only responds well to Argan oil. 
3336 2018-04-16 17:39:01 Yet another example from the fram oil filter theory of economics:  pay for it now or pay much more later
3337 2018-04-16 17:38:56 Nowhere is the question more acute than in oil and gas, the sector in which Russia is most interested.
3338 2018-04-16 17:38:44 Probably not. More was accomplished last month when 200+ Wagner mercenaries got killed, trying to take oil refinery from Kurds.
3339 2018-04-16 17:38:35 @BluRadioCo @BahiaFM88 @jamaica @JANewsNetwork @ppkamigo @shakira ,, 4,) And maybe they could make a own fuel with vegetable oil, coconut or whatever ? Or also alcohol, or a Combination of it ? I have no knowledge about the Engines ? But it could a Option ?

3341 2018-04-16 17:38:03 Yep. Trump lied to his supporters who bought his snake oil and elected him president. Lies can be powerful.
3342 2018-04-16 17:37:57 pardon me f. sharing a truth about oil spills. Just one of those annoying people. You can un-follow me now
3343 2018-04-16 17:37:56 What privacy could he need to talk to trump? To talk about or to oil, gas and coal tycoons like Robert Murray?  Not buying Pruitt's "excuse."
3344 2018-04-16 17:37:56 It is still likely Amazon will only pay a fraction of what oil workers made. People's finances are based on their incomes. Families could lose their homes as well as their credit if their incomes are cut drastically.

3349 2018-04-16 17:37:23 Trying out some CBD oil for the first time today. It’s been a day filled with a lot of strange pains. 
Hoping it will take the edge of my daily aches and pains but I am also curious as to how it will work with my mental health. 

Looking forward to seeing how it goes.
3350 2018-04-16 17:36:58 Hey remember to take control of the oil fields while you're out there saving the women and children you want to keep out of France!

3355 2018-04-16 17:36:19 You know you’re a good friend when you bring your friends car to get an oil change while she’s at work

3357 2018-04-16 17:35:58 Kale and organic olive oil. Truffles are for good working ppl who pulled themselves up like good people
3358 2018-04-16 17:35:51 I guess I do need to spell it out for u. You are protecting the oil+gas industry. Enviro's are working to protect the Earth, giving us the PRODUCT of clean air, water, soil. Unless you are prepared to say you dont use clean water, air, soil than your argument collapses on itself.
3359 2018-04-16 17:35:44 Can you blame him for not wanting staffers to hear his calls to 1-900-SEXY-OIL?  
"Hey big boy, is that a derrick in your pocket, or are you just happy to be ruining the environment?"
3360 2018-04-16 17:35:39 For real bhahaha all the oil field workers
3361 2018-04-16 17:35:34 @FoxNews owner @RupertMurdoch sits on the board of Israeli oil company Genie Energy that wants to drill for oil on the Occupied Golan Heights in violation of Geneva Accords( a war crime) don’t expect to hear his on @FoxNews
3362 2018-04-16 17:35:32 Fixed it!  - "My oil donor buddies wanted it, so did Putin and I only like to please them, the citizens can go screw themselves, IDGAFF about them."
3363 2018-04-16 17:35:25 Vamwe baba forgot to buy cooking oil, can I use annointed oil to cook?
3364 2018-04-16 17:35:24 I find that fish oil meme hilarious! 
3365 2018-04-16 17:34:48 “China Has Made A Huge Mistake” – The Next Oil Boom Is About To Happen Here, not there, or anywhere else!
3366 2018-04-16 17:34:38 True, but you know, the oil industry jobs were inflated pay compared to Alberta and the rest of the provinces during the boom. So comparisons need to be made carefully.
3367 2018-04-16 17:34:31 That’s impressive build height for oil quick! I like it! 
3368 2018-04-16 17:34:23 Moroccan oil has good ones
3369 2018-04-16 17:34:11 As long as the pipeline is built with safety for the environment etc. I am in favor of it.  However, and this is for Mr. Kenny and Premier Notley, how come you don't build two refineries in Alberta to produce clean oil and then ship it via pipeline to Vancouver.
3370 2018-04-16 17:34:08 Wtf? Take that shit out and put you in some kale.
3371 2018-04-16 17:34:08 Hi @Prileeto , the hair could absolutely grow back, but you will need to assist it. Refrain from putting anymore stress on the hairline, keep it moisturized and massage an oil into nightly. Please wear a silk/satin scarf at night.  #AskKavuli #GirlTalkZA
3372 2018-04-16 17:33:58  it’s the hot oil part
3373 2018-04-16 17:33:57 Help I'm what way?? 
3374 2018-04-16 17:33:51 She’s just mad the country didn’t turn commie under BHO and doesn’t own the oil companies she wanted the gov to own.

3376 2018-04-16 17:33:31 Amazon jobs would not pay the same as the oil industry.

3384 2018-04-16 17:32:50 Dear John & Liz: You are very fortunate your Alberta NDP bedfellows have not limited or shut off the flow of Bitumen/Oil/Gas in the existing pipeline. You’ve painted yourselves in a political corner & since you can’t win there’s nowhere to go. Time to cut your losses & save face.
3385 2018-04-16 17:32:45 Swirl some garlic puree into some olive oil, brush it onto cauliflower florets, roast them for 40 minutes, turning and re-brushing halfway through, and then package up the result and mail it to me because I am now the cauliflower queen.
3386 2018-04-16 17:32:39 It's funny cos I've always found Simon Thompson extremely patchy on his Resources Tips - I guess Oil in a sweet spot at moment.

3416 2018-04-16 17:29:43 Basically scientists just catalogue everything. My biggest question is why you want so badly for them to be wrong? Is it because it's scary? Cause it is. What background or secret do you have that makes you know better than every climatologist who isn't funded by an oil company?
3417 2018-04-16 17:29:42 Hey "YA ALL"
It causes me "LAUGHTER" and "PAIN" to hear and for many to eat! The words "it is for our national security" mmmmmm... 
Why don't they say FOR OIL AND $?

3433 2018-04-16 17:27:52 Do you use a beard oil, or balm, or mustache wax to keep it in shape?
3434 2018-04-16 17:27:48 I agree with this. But I think he got way too much credit for these things, given that he said equally as much on the other side--for aggressive wars (remember "take the oil") and for huge tax cuts for the wealthy and ending ACA, with no viable replacement.
3435 2018-04-16 17:27:45 This WH ALSO aids-and-abets SAUDIS in committing WAR CRIMES and GENOCIDE, in Yemen ... all for the sake of OIL!! Doubt me? Read-up on it! And, Afghanistan? Wresting control of POPPY FIELDS in order to cash-in on BIG DRUG BUSINESS. No WAR ON TERROR or other IDEALISTIC BS!!
3436 2018-04-16 17:27:44 Oooooooooo. Good one.
3437 2018-04-16 17:27:28 There is a different kind of oil, not fossil fuel, but Omega-3 from the sea is worth more, and they are growing Omega-3 in shell fish in New Zealand, Omega-3 makes you smarter, and the New Zealanders are smart banning off shore drilling.
3438 2018-04-16 17:27:23 Of hemp oil is derived from flowers or unapproved cultivars that would be illegal. If oil is produced without an industrial hemp license or without an ‘LP’ license that would also be illegal
3439 2018-04-16 17:27:23 But oil from Saint John is refined to natural gas and sent across north america
3440 2018-04-16 17:27:06 It is disappointing because many of us had high expectations for Spartan; however, from today's perspective, the deal is a 5% premium for Spartan shareholders. Ill probably sell at 10% because large caps dont interest me in this stage of the #oil recovery.

3445 2018-04-16 17:26:37 Alberta #tarsands is not oil. Canada doesn't refine it or use the bitumen. It is sent to market at a loss by USA companies who will not share their profits with you.
3446 2018-04-16 17:26:32 They might protect those two proposed oil pipelines in some way
3447 2018-04-16 17:26:31 I'm Canadian and concerned about what my government does.  I'm going to lobby my government to stop the expansion of the tar sands.  I'll let Californians worry about their oil.  Also, tar sands oil is dirty, hard to upgrade, and needs to stay in the ground.

3450 2018-04-16 17:26:20 at first i felt like a dumb asshole spending $60 on eyelash growth serum, assuming it would just end up being a snake oil, but TEN people in the last week asked me when i got lash extensions so now i still feel like an asshole, but just not as dumb.
3451 2018-04-16 17:26:11 Did I hear him correctly "champion for the cause of freedom & democracy" for a man who called the press "enemy of the American people", a man who tolerates KKK and neo-Nazis and praises oil rich despots in the Gulf - how is that for freedom and democracy?
3452 2018-04-16 17:26:09 Got an oil change later today. Stream will begin when I get back :) Also, working on Dojo Contest Video atm for YouTube :)

3469 2018-04-16 17:24:33 .@MayorofLA threw shade at @realDonaldTrump for auctioning our coast to the highest-bidding oil company. Yet, City of LA seems happy to open up Angelenos' backyards.

3472 2018-04-16 17:24:20 You can't compare oil sands to conventional. Oil sands are long term high capital ventures that companies don't walk away from over cyclical prices. They leave because of jurisdictional dysfunction.

3474 2018-04-16 17:23:53 Whether he committed suicide for global warming or not,  it certainly got the desired attention.  The US absolutely would be better off if we reduced our dependence on foreign oil, so there’s a suicide with a purpose.
3475 2018-04-16 17:23:53 @EmmanuelMacron In 1959 nobody though that Castro a banana tyrant would be a nuclear threat and should dominate Venezuela, Nicaragua, Bolivia.

3476 2018-04-16 17:23:50 On the train back from Chesterfield, covered in oil, hands all cut, in a knackered tracksuit, holding a carrier bag with my belongings in it. I believe the term is Heroin chic.
3477 2018-04-16 17:23:48 try to limit palm oil, palm oil sourced foods and ask if restaurants use it, because they are destroying Indonesian wildlife with production and sales of palm oil
3478 2018-04-16 17:23:41 This reminds me of a cartoon published not long after the Valdez spill.  The Exxon board of directors had just completed a vote, with the punchline revealing the agenda: "And it's unanimous!  Oil *does* mix with water."
3479 2018-04-16 17:23:20 Had plenty of good lamb, but no one thought to strip the meat and off a juicy chop and wrap it in with bean sprouts, chili oil and bok choy.
3480 2018-04-16 17:23:16 I wonder if sachets with mint oil would discourage them.  It works on wasps....
3481 2018-04-16 17:23:15 real  for real Indigenous & Black woke folks-how do you:

a) decide which stories of racist violence (incl oil spills etc) to share w/out overwhelming yourself & others w all of the horror 

b) scroll past what u choose not to share w/out disassociating

Asking for myself.
3482 2018-04-16 17:23:13 Real oil don't freeze
3483 2018-04-16 17:22:58 Hell...I can change my own oil. 
3484 2018-04-16 17:22:58 lol, unlike some people that use the 2m barrels of crude oil to cook soup
3485 2018-04-16 17:22:51 The man at Penzoil ask me why my man not getting my oil changed !
3486 2018-04-16 17:22:44 Scotiabank: The oil outlook has firmed and WTI crude prices are now expected to average $65/bbl in 2018 before rising to average $68/bbl in 2019, a roughly 15% increase relative to our January outlook.

3487 2018-04-16 17:22:33 There are xxx times more reasons to bomb the Saudi oil dynasty which is sponsoring Islamist terror groups than the secular ruler of Syria Assad that has the support of all Christians in his country ,wonder why?
3488 2018-04-16 17:22:27 The oil price is set by the cargo available on the spot market. If there is one marginal barrel glut the price falls until a buyer is found. 1 bbl short causes a rise. It cannot set by government but they often restock strategic reserves in a down market.
3489 2018-04-16 17:22:26 One could argue the US fits in the "foreign dictator" category :)

And when the oil companies put origin labels on the gas pumps we can start discussing who is in bed with dictators. Until then it is the oil companies, not us.
3490 2018-04-16 17:22:19 A spill of crude oil is NOT the same as a spill of dilbit. Get educated about the problem!
3491 2018-04-16 17:22:11 @colbertlateshow this story?! Texas owned #KinderMorgan is about to lay a giant pipe through some of BCs wealthiest natural resource zones n indigenous lands. Oil spill would be catastrophic. #JustinTrudeau is hated by BC. Quebec Pens letter shaming him 
3492 2018-04-16 17:22:10 Gross people.  Not America, freak show.  Give them a stage and they sell snake oil.
3493 2018-04-16 17:22:07 Who wanna pay for this oil change 
3494 2018-04-16 17:21:56 there is need for much more research to understand protection and even more smart discovery research to use our dirty oil to benefit Canadian economy
3495 2018-04-16 17:21:53 Arguindegui Oil Company’s mission is to provide a financially solid return on investment for its stakeholders, to continue to create profitable business ventures, enable a rewarding long-term employment for its employee partners, and to positively influence the communities.
3496 2018-04-16 17:21:53 because they're REALLY proud that they can change their own oil.. which is generally just an excuse to drink beer.. like fishing.. or bowling.. or golf
3497 2018-04-16 17:21:48 we came to the car dealership to get the license plate now we are getting a car wash, oil change and everything  this is what happens when i’m with my dad
3498 2018-04-16 17:21:32 Why does this Nigga looks like he moisturised with engine oil ?
3499 2018-04-16 17:21:24 It would either be illegal sales of flower derived oil or hemp oil derived from seed and stock
3500 2018-04-16 17:21:19 Agreed, we need sustainability criteria for everything, including batteries, gas, oil... but the fact that cobalt is problematic (which it is) doesn't put into question a whole technology. I recommend to read the bloomberg article
3501 2018-04-16 17:21:14 Does any dumbf*** in the government know that diesel that powers industries,transport trucks is ending today on 210?...for an oil producing country?
3502 2018-04-16 17:21:14 That’s our government would rather waste our money invading/ bombing countries in the name of terrorism when really it’s for oil and control of their economy
3503 2018-04-16 17:21:02 Ghar me poora dabba hota hai oil ka phir bhi amme ko tension hojati hai, isliye mene ab ghar me banana hi chordiye. Bahir se kha leti hun.

3505 2018-04-16 17:20:54 Hi Dan, years ago when Kerry was Secretary of State Assad actually gave all his chemical weapons to us so we wouldn’t invade him. There’s no evidence other than people’s “word” on it. It was used as an excuse to violently intervene with Syria, likely for its abundance of oil
3506 2018-04-16 17:20:54 One can think of blocking a pipe as a tax on AB oil and gas firms (a tax equivalent to the additional cost to ship by rail). Displaced barrels therefore also represent an aggregate global cost (though not one-to-one). So, I'd say that while I agree with your (2), still not bad.
3507 2018-04-16 17:20:54 Question - The last war Britain participated in that didn't involve didn't involve a oil rich country is - ???
3508 2018-04-16 17:20:52 I want Saudi money , I want art/fashion/oil money 
3509 2018-04-16 17:20:45 Our government is holding secret talks with a multinational oil company, while our PM held a meeting with leaders of BC & Alberta and failed to invite Indigenous Leaders to a discussion that faces civil unrest from as far away as Quebec.

3510 2018-04-16 17:20:38 You know, a lot of morons are talking about tax dollars funding oil.
Any one of you able to show exactly what KM has asked for?
Also, can you show where funding for protests and lawsuits comes from?

If it wasn't for your oil saviour you'd still be mediocre
3512 2018-04-16 17:20:30 Our ability to be energy independent rely on our oil industry which is booming now and is a BIG threat to RUSSIA as well as domestic terrorists from the Sierra Club and others who would try to sabotage our energy agenda.  He has gotten many death threats from the left as well.
3513 2018-04-16 17:20:24 Might have to cop some CBD oil
3514 2018-04-16 17:20:20 Yurk. What are you trying? I’m still powering on with the cbd oil. Been taking a dose at lunch time as well as before bed.
3515 2018-04-16 17:20:18 the spill not withstanding... it was proven not to be profitable and break even at $95 barrel. any expansion is just hoping the oil prices rise.
It is a huge environmental disaster that can be seen from space
3516 2018-04-16 17:20:12 $50 for a oil change 
3517 2018-04-16 17:20:11 Let's just say that the number of casualties in unjust wars contains many poor and minority enlistees. We have wars for profit,vwars for oil.
When did we have a war for economic injustice?
3518 2018-04-16 17:19:55 No palm oil either, which most granolas seem to have. Result.
3519 2018-04-16 17:19:48 So - if the product says in the ingredients 'pure hemp oil' it's actually not a CBD oil - correct?
3520 2018-04-16 17:19:40 Had a good weekend. Yesterday i was buzzing it then I knocked out woke up early around 9 & now getting my oil done for free. Beakfeast time
3521 2018-04-16 17:19:38 Keep in mind Syria is 1 of 4 countries that doesn’t have a Rothschilds central bank. don’t forget they have oil too
3522 2018-04-16 17:19:33 Oil. It's all about wanting what they have.
3523 2018-04-16 17:19:26 Expansion into markets that will not pay more than what Alberta companies get now. Those markets also have other providers, most notably the US. Also, expanding oil sands production all but guarantees no hope with meeting Canada's Paris pledges.
3524 2018-04-16 17:19:25 "It (oil) once provided the Alberta state with 30 per cent of its revenue and an excuse to lower taxes to win votes. Since 2015 lower oil prices combined with embarrassingly low royalties have dropped that revenue share to a painful eight per cent."
3525 2018-04-16 17:19:22 Refineries r there in desert area. Also new refinery work is in progress. But question is how to get crude oil which we don't have. People and political parties opposing to give land to railway also.
3526 2018-04-16 17:19:22 I hope Christian Aid is supporting the development of oil extraction in the Western Rift, Uganda. That will be tranformative for Ugandans & slow down deforestation
3527 2018-04-16 17:19:22 treat your body to exotic fruits with seeds, green leafy plants, spirulina, ph balanced hawaiian volcanic water, himalayan sea salt, hemp seeds, hemp oil, & bee pollen
3528 2018-04-16 17:19:16 As many as 155,000 oil and gas wells in Alberta, are inactive.
Fast forward to now, the Feds and the Province of Alberta are once again looking to lure Atlantic Canada and every other province, with big money and thousands of jobs.  #stopkindermorgan
3529 2018-04-16 17:19:16 ha ha ha! Big Oil has far more lobbying money in the game and it is almost entirely foreign
3530 2018-04-16 17:19:11 Tour update. Morale high. Oil changed in the van and new air mattress purchased for the big dog. See ya soon Cleveland.

3534 2018-04-16 17:19:01 Thanks, very interesting and helpful. Certified is a good step but I prefer no palm oil.  Some crackers have none (e.g. sea salt) so why palm oil at all in garlic crackers? Also, some bananas in Lidl do not have Fairtrade or Rainforest on them.  The page says all are. Are they?

3536 2018-04-16 17:18:48 I need to get my oil changed while I’m in the dirty j but I just can’t seem to pry myself away from these snugglin pups
3537 2018-04-16 17:18:37 So packed, I just wanna get an oil change 
3538 2018-04-16 17:18:32 After several rainy days we finally get some sun on our balconies, it is a pleasure to enjoy our lunch with windows open. 

Today's menu was trofie pasta with fresh mini tomatoes, prosciutto, mozzarella, rucola, mache, wallnuts and extra virgin olive oil.
3539 2018-04-16 17:18:11 pandering to big oil is not in the best interests of BC, Canada or the planet
3540 2018-04-16 17:18:02 @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh this is where public tax $$ should be helping - not dirty oil
3541 2018-04-16 17:17:56 These effing oil wars are going to kill a lot of people aren’t they.
3542 2018-04-16 17:17:55 Glad I got my oil change
3543 2018-04-16 17:17:48 So many MP's licking the arse of May. Either to keep their horrendous Government or to attack Corbyn!  They all know  May is wrong!  They all know the chemical attack was staged. They all know this to do with the gas pipe line and oil I am disgusted with these MP's
3544 2018-04-16 17:17:43 Wasn’t it Labour who followed the US to wage war in Iraq with no evidence of WMDs? Opposed by Corbyn and millions of British citizens. Once again it’s all because of oil pipelines
3545 2018-04-16 17:17:41 #ArdernFES Is the end to new oil and gas exploration in NZ announced this week part of a wider international move taken in consultation with industry?
3546 2018-04-16 17:17:33 If you are so concerned about the influence of “foreign interests” explain how an oil company from Texas doesn’t fall into that category?
3547 2018-04-16 17:17:15 Does it got oil?
3548 2018-04-16 17:16:56 Next step- Moroneau says negotiations with KM is at an impasse,

3553 2018-04-16 17:16:23 I've basically been drowning my lips in aquaphor and bio oil because I'm sick and they feel like they're gonna fall off, and NOTHING helps
3554 2018-04-16 17:16:22 Where's the incentive to do anything, if we double down on oil?  All this is doing is kicking the can further down the road.  It's stealing from the future to pay for comforts now.  It's morally criminal.

3556 2018-04-16 17:16:05 Your taste in condiments fucking sucks. Why even bother eating peanut butter if you want that crunchy shit? Just pile a bunch of peanuts, oil, and sugar onto your sandwich then! Goddamn!
3557 2018-04-16 17:16:04 Bitumen is not oil. B.C. might be less worried if it was oil.
3558 2018-04-16 17:16:03 Ok, this is the only time I have ever spoken against America;
Kinda sucks doesn't it, considering America has been doing that to Canada for years. We are the 2nd largest oil reserve in the world and don't even list us in the top ten. Stop treating us like f**king Mexico.
3559 2018-04-16 17:16:01 More astonishing to me is that any birth control is needed there...
3560 2018-04-16 17:15:54 I still don’t even think it’s a great tactic, I wonder if the oil companies would be a fan of it, I wonder what good is it to harm people that may not even care what’s happening or that’s supporting Alberta. What a mess.
3561 2018-04-16 17:15:51 So if I am already benefiting from those things why do we need to risk tanker spills and expand oil production? I understand we have debt, but we should be putting money into education to ensure future generations have good oportunities not lining pockets of oil corps.
3562 2018-04-16 17:15:48 Oil in the lamp
3563 2018-04-16 17:15:42 Yep... but I don’t wash and vacuum the car like he did ... or check the oil. But maybe I should; At least it would be clean sometimes then.
3564 2018-04-16 17:15:39 Having a car is fun and all until I had to pay 60 dollars for an oil change..
3565 2018-04-16 17:15:36 But the Alberta tar sands ...that’s filth disguised as oil
3566 2018-04-16 17:15:32 Oil change time! YAY!
3567 2018-04-16 17:15:28 Adequate if you are ok with dictatorships around the world getting rich of their unethical oil.

3569 2018-04-16 17:15:10 Oh.Increased travel is causing a drastic need for more oil. Thank goodness for Dickhead's travel ban,huh? Effect has probably been negated by all the fuel needed to get those missiles to Syria,though. What DickHead Don would call a "win-win".
3570 2018-04-16 17:15:08 Now imagine being a woman in the automotive industry. Imagine having men explain to you the difference between 5w-20 and 5w-30 every damn day when they request an oil change.

3573 2018-04-16 17:14:49 They will fall back on their claim that it fits within the Pan Canadian  Framework that was arrived at with oil sands expansion and pipeline  approval as prerequisites. They will ignore their own UN submission  that reports we won't meet their (inadequate) GHG reduction target

3577 2018-04-16 17:14:35 You say the KM pipeline is in Canada's interest, but it's obviously only in Alberta's interest and in the interest of people that actually work in the oil sands, no one else. You constantly talk about a world class spill response, but never with any details?
3578 2018-04-16 17:14:25 Here's my question. Only the squeaky wheel gets the oil? What about Washington State and all of the other Sanctuary States? They ALL need to be sued and now is the time. Happy CA is being called out. Unhappy that DOJ doesn't call out ALL of them. Why not?
3579 2018-04-16 17:14:14 I camped on the gulf coast a few days ago. Looking out to the horizon, oil rigs in every direction. The break in the waves, dark murky brown. And I won't even try to describe the smell!

3582 2018-04-16 17:13:41 Trust us, Oilers fans are well aware of the apparent problems but it doesn’t mean that we won’t become jaded when a major sports network says “Hey Leafs fans, your team hasn’t shown up for the playoffs but don’t worry, they aren’t the Oil! Hahaha” And yes, we’re sensitive

3587 2018-04-16 17:13:20 I do want top dollar for our resources which is why we should tax the industry effectively and raise royalties. Oil production is the highest in history and we are going broke. 

Once it leaves the ground it belongs to industry. The pipeline gets a better price for them not us.

 We need cheaper sustainable homes and cheaper energy prices. 
 We don't need to pay huge fees and taxes. We need to invest in clean and cheaper energy.
3633 2018-04-16 17:07:33 However we can hopefully pull in new investors in the green energy sector and create jobs that will last hundreds of years rather than contribute to the dying oil industry. Oil won't be gone in our lifetime but eventually it will be.

Consider this: when the gov't of Canada talks about risks of a 590kbpd heavy oil pipeline, the issue is financial risk to the company and oil industry, not #climate.

3645 2018-04-16 17:06:21 Money, Guns Manufacturing, Oil and Gas, Pharmceutical Industry, expermenting, asset control, and geographical control. Everything else is irrelevant. Welcome to the new world order. Roadmap execution is on track.
3646 2018-04-16 17:06:20 Woke up early on my day off to get an oil change and it’s gonna take two and half hours 
3647 2018-04-16 17:06:19 Right, so if it truly is 'hemp oil' (as per Canadian regulations), then there is little or no CBD in it since that comes from the flower.

3649 2018-04-16 17:06:15 Odd thought this. US doesn’t need to buy oil anymore. They have so much they’ve shutdown many shale oil fields. In any case isn’t Venezuela a bit closer to USA  And what about all this oil we apparently have in the North Sea? Where’s it gone?
3650 2018-04-16 17:06:13 How many millions of litres of diesel fuel is expelled in the atmosphere as trainloads of oil are moved to the coast of BC. ? #pollution #buildKM #energy #cleanenergy 
Use safe clean pipelines!

3652 2018-04-16 17:06:01 odd thing when you closed the wheat board farmers could no longer get their product to market bumper crops being eaten by vermin but oil is being shipped farmers friend I DON'T Think so @AndrewScheer #CPClown
3653 2018-04-16 17:06:01 They never left square one. Until they accept to uncomfortable truth that their club is being run into the ground (again) by snake oil salesmen and the media stops feeding them the myth that they’re ‘coming’ they will never leave it either.

3656 2018-04-16 17:05:47 Oklahoma gives huge tax breaks to oil & gas, then forced to reduce the number of school days in the week. Between that & ridiculous marijuana convictions, the state is turning into a toilet. Too many fucking Republicans running things & they dumped Scott Pruitt on us. #WhyILeft
3657 2018-04-16 17:05:33 You could try the CBD oil that I'm using Hope. It really helps with alot of different things. I love it and wish I could afford a barrel of it lol
3658 2018-04-16 17:05:22 The NDP bottomed out world oil prices? The NDP spent all of Alberta's Heritage Fund to give non affordable tax breaks??

I guess the NDP started those wild fires too.
3659 2018-04-16 17:05:18 Why? You oppose oil, correct?
Why don't you use renewables, or some kind of "green tech"?

3668 2018-04-16 17:03:50 Just a word of advise, any lubricant if cream or oil based can darken the skin of your penis. So if dark na, it can grow darker hehe !

3671 2018-04-16 17:03:13 Vivi needs some work done too her. I gotta get my baby right soon. At least her oil change is out the way.
3672 2018-04-16 17:03:08 Don’t be ridiculous! We all realise our dependence on oil, and our natural resources.. it’s the gross mismanagement, the complete unaccountability of the companies involved, the absolute absence of long term thinking, and investment in better, cleaner, and safer technologies.
3673 2018-04-16 17:03:06 You do understand that bitumen is not tar, yes?
I'm mad because you use a term created by US interests to - wrongly - describe a Canadian resource.
Do you remember the "dirty oil" label attached to it - while nothing said about California's "dirtier" oil?
3674 2018-04-16 17:03:01 3) we won ww2 cause we cut supply chain, German soldiers starved , froze ,cut oil etc. those who don't support wall and immigration are contributing to delinquency of DEMS . Read UN report I sent cut the funds, another was social media listening to hirono .

3676 2018-04-16 17:02:50 @RyanZinke Ryan Zinke is allowing oil, gas, and coal industry insiders to decide the fate of our National Parks. Stop the sellout of our public lands. Keep it in the ground! Resign.

3696 2018-04-16 17:00:53 I wondered why Canada doesn’t build a refinery so I asked an oil and gas marketer. The answer: the amount of money it would cost to build is huge and would never be recouped. On top of that, Canada can’t possibly use all the oil it would refine, so that means... pipelines.

3774 2018-04-16 16:52:05 a vast amount of scottish oil money was pumped into the London/ south east infrastructure &  economy - with first past the post perhaps its just been buying votes?

3776 2018-04-16 16:51:14 It's part of the" leave the oil in the ground" Liberal plan
PM now sends in Moroneau 2 negotiate with KM.
He will rag the talks & play Scrooge saying it's too expensive.
KM sees there's no future in Canada & leaves.
Anti oil Soros monkey Butts' plan is successful & on schedule
3777 2018-04-16 16:51:11 Hey Kent. Doubt you will get an answer from Scott who is very busy meeting with big oil and gas lobbyists, figuring out ways he can de-regulate safeguards for the enviornment. Picked by Icahn so he can benefit the dark money donors and wreck the planet for greed.
3778 2018-04-16 16:51:09 @MohammedHkalari Hi Mohammed I'm a journalist working on a film about Iraqi Kurdistan for the BBC. I have a few questions regarding the oil industry. Can you follow me so I can PM you please? Thank you
3779 2018-04-16 16:51:08 I agree my point was simply that sometimes people have a fetish with the economic interests that provoked Wars, Take Iraq, establishing a regional gendarme to carry out the US's dirty work in the region was far more important than oil, similar to the Nixon Doctrine.
3780 2018-04-16 16:51:05 i hjate their fucking hijinks like when they replace my FUCKING face lotion with god damn COOKING OIL. i AM SLIMY NOW
3781 2018-04-16 16:51:02 I pay tax on the oil flowing through BC which hurts the average British Columbian. I'm a student and work in the restaraunt industry, how does a handfull of jobs not in my sector help me.
3782 2018-04-16 16:51:01 If I was Exxon at Shell and the other oil companies the states that propagate The hoax of global warming I would have a shortage of oil going there YouTube concerns of carbon emissions transport transferring to them
3783 2018-04-16 16:50:53 It depends on the environment. If poison or oil is around, meteor shower. But Hailstorm has the advantage of melting and then creating a large water filled area that can be electrified or frozen again
3784 2018-04-16 16:50:51 Perhaps someone will investigate why Pruitt needs all of that secrecy in an agency that deals with the environment. Perhaps when you are talking to oil and coal companies all day, and others who want to exploit the U.S. natural resources, you need a little privacy.
3785 2018-04-16 16:50:44 Yea he was really smart. David thinking “Hmm, I’m gonna set myself on fire to protest fossil fuels, yea I guess I’ll need a starter, maybe some oil or coal., haha I crack myself up, sorry for the mess” what an idiot.

3788 2018-04-16 16:50:28 @theresa_may Conclusive proof of chemical weapons first please, then action. Your actions seem out of order. Just out of interest, does Syria have much oil reserves or re-sellable infrastructure?
3789 2018-04-16 16:50:24 Great thoughts, you’re right about OKC, there are a mountain of oil “ventures” out in this part of the world
3790 2018-04-16 16:50:18 Hey Brad can I go to your backyard and buy all the oil I can suck out of that little corner? You pay for all the costs, effort, and environmental fees but I’ll pay you a couple pennies on top of your costs and sell it to the world for $millions more. I’m the USA. You are Canada.

3801 2018-04-16 16:48:46 Went to @Sephora for a sample of a face oil and they literally gave me one drop... lol I guess I’m supposed to know if it makes my skin better after one use?

3805 2018-04-16 16:48:40 I think Twitter can be a good place to build interest, but @mbacowboy is right about the paperwork. Spend the money for an hour with a good securities lawyer. I bet OKC has a bunch who have helped launch oil ventures
3806 2018-04-16 16:48:36 Its that time again..massage..warm up the oil..
3807 2018-04-16 16:48:25 So Russian forces that are working under full authority of legitimate Syrian Govt are aggressors? And ISIS terrorists rebels backed by Saudis and US illegally occupying Syrian Oil resources and victims? Great logic.
3808 2018-04-16 16:48:24 I'm not against Oil. I'm against the over exploitation of our resources. The rate of extraction is too high and the current pipelines provide adequate service
3809 2018-04-16 16:48:24 i wonder what coconut oil would do over that tarteist lip paint
3810 2018-04-16 16:48:09 It depends how you prepare^^
Rain + hail storm is great.
Meteor storm into (cursed) oil barrels is powerful.

3816 2018-04-16 16:47:27 Oil prices plunge as Syrian tensions ease, #WTI -1.20% at 66.56
3817 2018-04-16 16:47:25 The infrastucture to extract and refine oil sands is already built in North Eastern Alberta. Getting s pipeline would simply increase its value by $10 per barrel for Canadians instead of it being taken by Americans for pennies on the dollar to sell for the market price.

3826 2018-04-16 16:46:15 But apart from the Oil rights,Gas Pipeline access,Mercenary Contracts,Security contracts,Rebuilding Contracts,Training contracts, Weapons Contracts other natural resources, a new country to tie to a system of debt, a new market for us to exploit I don't see what we get out of it.
3827 2018-04-16 16:46:11 Looking to loot? Russian forces are invited by legitimate Syrian govt and operating in Syria fighting against ISIS. Syrian Oil fields are property of Syrian Govt, not of US backed rebels.
3828 2018-04-16 16:46:09 Even they know fossil fuels are becoming obsolete, too bad our President is owned by the coal and oil lobbyists!

Now please get off my lawn. 
3832 2018-04-16 16:45:59 the guy I buy weed from asked if I wanted these wax papers that had excess oil on them ( he didn't want to scrap it off & I understand why now lmao ) 
Anyways after I got it all of it was like 5 grams or more lol I don't think I'll need oil for a while so that's cool
3833 2018-04-16 16:45:59 Finally got that oil change
3834 2018-04-16 16:45:58 Same!! Weed helps , but only to a point , like you said when i comes to work. I would definitely try an oil. But keep in my when  smell the iil try and take my mind to a happy place ( comfort ) i know it sounds corny but it helped me and i hope it helps you
3835 2018-04-16 16:45:47 We do free consultations with clients who are willing to spend $1000s each year on aesthetics. Yet, they get lazy with skin care. That’s like driving a Mercedes and not getting the oil changed!
3836 2018-04-16 16:45:33 Yeah but we don’t care. All our players play for dirty terrorist oil money... but for some reason you think your players play for the badge or to win the Europa league ... best team won... mind the gap!! #mcfc #champions

3838 2018-04-16 16:45:17 Syria strategy ? Why we still in Middle East ? DEMS are obstructing the ban, Iran deal cancellation, immigration ,everify for money laundering , border control, drug trade , vetting, oil production,human trafficking,illegals sanctuary cities .
3839 2018-04-16 16:45:14  and it’s great at absorbing flavours so if there’s a little bit of flavoured oil or some lemon or basically a dressing it really seeps in and is better the next day sort of thing.
3840 2018-04-16 16:45:14 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
3841 2018-04-16 16:45:08 There’s ur partisanship! I’m from AB, I WANT the pipeline as does my family. The difference between u & I is I know dumping this all on Trudeau is not fair. It was Jim Prentice who told us to “look in the mirror” when the oil boom ended, blaming Albertans for the economic crash.

3846 2018-04-16 16:44:37 No it's about an oil pipeline
3847 2018-04-16 16:44:34 Media:Hey why are gas prices going up?
AAA: Uh uh the strike in Syria 
Media: Syria hasn't had serious oil production since 2012.
AAA: Uhhhhhh *grabs 30 year old copy of Time* tensions could cause Iran to threaten to close the Strait of Hormuz.

3852 2018-04-16 16:44:10 Well my money-saving gamble nearly paid off: heating oil will be delivered tomorrow & we only ran out yesterday. Two slightly chilly days for £250? Worth it!
3853 2018-04-16 16:43:55 Nah... it's like when gas goes from $2 to $4... then down to $3 and big oil goes "hey! look at us being awesome and kind to you with your cheap $3 gas!"
3854 2018-04-16 16:43:36 Stop global warming by selling more oil. Pregnant thought!

3858 2018-04-16 16:42:56 And it was a labour government who killed thousands for Iraqi oil #syriastatement
3859 2018-04-16 16:42:42 That’s not how the oil markets work, but the USA has finally began producing so much we are exporting oil now. 10 years ago we produced far less than we needed, not the case anymore
3860 2018-04-16 16:42:28 People being gassed far away doesn't matter? Well if you think this govt cares about it ur v v naive. Ok for armchair generals but bugger our troops having to go or Syrians being killed aye? 13k UK military vets r HOMELESS with PTSD. Care? This govt doesn't give a toss.OIL!!!
3861 2018-04-16 16:42:24 Heat the pot/wok to high, with about 4tbsp of oil. Scramble the eggs, adding salt as desired, drain the oil from the eggs into pot. Then add shrimp/ veggies. As this cooks quickly, you then add the cold rice and the eggs back
3862 2018-04-16 16:42:21 Yoooo, so how bout I came up with the most scientifically solid explanation for why our skin produces oil!
3863 2018-04-16 16:42:16 'Russian oil in steady decline' ??--- Russia  oil production hit a 30-year high in 2017, averaging nearly 11 mbpd

3865 2018-04-16 16:42:00 Rosemary...any plans for interviews with the many First Nations that support our Oil Industry? Or will the Libs/NDP not allow?
3866 2018-04-16 16:41:56 grab the oil and bless us please. that's how we become kings and queens
3867 2018-04-16 16:41:53 Also oil corps have received hundreds of millions of tax $ through subsidies for decades but perhaps Leader Smear has forgotten that do you think?
3868 2018-04-16 16:41:39 Divest from oil.
3869 2018-04-16 16:41:37 My father is an engineer who used to run an oil pressing project in Norton. Small world.
3870 2018-04-16 16:41:37 But the lines are different. Those former communist countries that built institutions have developed; those that were captured by cliques (of basically criminals) have not.

The latter have become resource economies of clique's fighting over access to oil revenue like Angola etc.
3871 2018-04-16 16:41:23 I said I needed good news, not this bs. & my oil light just came on. 
3872 2018-04-16 16:41:20 Usually just coconut oil sometimes before my shower. And semi regular protein hair masks. But other than that it’s just the routine I posted! I rotate the OGX Coconut Curls shampoo and conditioner with the other one I posted

3877 2018-04-16 16:40:46 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.

3887 2018-04-16 16:39:40 My opinion is that it justifies the expense if we stop having to import oil to America and become self sufficient and self sustaining. Is it expensive, yes. But does the outcome justify the expense, in my opinion yes.
3888 2018-04-16 16:39:38 Yeah, the truth about oil. Ha,ha, BP British Petroleum is the same company that spewed  4.9 million barrels 210 US gal 710,000 metres. cubed by 3 in the Gulf of Mexico .Stop  the bitumen oil transportation thru beautiful ,Vancouver BC waters.
3889 2018-04-16 16:39:34 i’m done with these rich ass wypipo thinking they know shit. bit shut up and let me explain why you’re wrong you pale looking ass, vienna sausage dipped in olive oil eating ass, hot bean water drinking ass bizzitches!!
3890 2018-04-16 16:39:30 You have no more proof of that than this govt or US. You seriously think this govt gives a stuff about people in Syria? FGS. This is about oil & gas and pipes and other US assets. This govt presided over 130k deaths due to their vicious policies. Please do get some facts.
3891 2018-04-16 16:39:25 Oil sands are getting cheaper and cheaper to refine. And the infrastructure is a sunk cost. It’s there already might as well use it. If it’s not piped it’ll be railed. Fighting a moot point. 100,000 pipelines in the US to tidewater. Only a few in Canada. Shooting self in foot.
3892 2018-04-16 16:39:23 Who needs coffee or even alcohol when black seed oil is around? The impact it has on your body is really something else. Thanks you @MandiiMz...
3893 2018-04-16 16:39:20 Oil Change International A Sister organization of Oil Change USA is an advocacy group promoting the use of Alternative fuels. So they are BIASED & not IMPARTIAL! Let all energy producers compete on equal terms. Oil, Natural Gas & Coal are more efficient & less expensive.

3895 2018-04-16 16:39:17 US killed Russians & Syrian troops who were trying to liberate Syrian Oil fields occupied by ISIS rebels. Warmonger Pompeo in confirmation hearings boosts about killing 100 Russians. TWSP supported that aggression.

3905 2018-04-16 16:38:22 @MyCascade Please get rid of the Palm Oil.
3906 2018-04-16 16:38:20 I just had a lil energy burst so I cleaned my room n sprinkled some rose essential oil around and I’m chillin
3907 2018-04-16 16:38:00 I’m just a stupid oil sands Millwright, but it all seems very simple to fix  to me . Have a B.C. drivers lic.? Out of Alberta. Have a Que Drivers Lic? Out of Alberta. Cut off Equ. Payments to both provinces . Cut off flow of energy to B.C. ...and re-up the wine boycott .
3908 2018-04-16 16:38:00 Energize your linens with lovely smelling #Lavender.  It leaves no oil marks & leaves things invigoratingly fresh. #essentialoil
3909 2018-04-16 16:37:58 I’m 48 and no way am I touching raw meat.  When seasoning etc will turn it round in the pot stirring all the seasonings in same with oil or anything.  Tipping chicken out of packaging.
3910 2018-04-16 16:37:44 use taliah waajid curly curl cream after washing, no blow drying, don’t wash more than every 3 days, and use argan oil spray on the days u don’t wash it! also i just got satin pillowcases so i’ll let u know how that goes lol
3911 2018-04-16 16:37:41 Sugarcane and Palm oil.....No?
3912 2018-04-16 16:37:41 Yeah . .I believe there are a few ways to make it. With soy protein or nuts, solidified vegetable oil . .none of it sounds appetizing. I want my cheese from a cow.
3913 2018-04-16 16:37:30 oil spill this weekend 
3914 2018-04-16 16:37:29 Ameen Karima, i go buy u oil well in dai kuddi na sayen ta
3915 2018-04-16 16:37:27 That’s what Putin wants, chaos but he wants others fighting not Russia, he wants oil at 200bbl.
3916 2018-04-16 16:37:18 Well its become quite apparent this is no longer a Government of the People. EPA chief needs a sound proof room! Backdoor deals with Big oil and coal companies.
3917 2018-04-16 16:37:12 It'll be clean, but we're still not able to produce clean batteries, we can't stock enough. Moreover windturbines and solar panels need rare earths, metals... today we do it cheap thanks to coal and oil. "Clean" energies don't exist for now. Gail Tveberg talks about it.
3918 2018-04-16 16:37:10 Payments made by R D S, the major international oil company operating in Nigeria to the federal government increased from $3638241040 in 2016 to $4322742582 in 2017. The rise in payment was as a result of a 10 % growth in production,oil company sustainability report on #Evinitia

3920 2018-04-16 16:37:03 Keith Hutchings says Nalcor's budget for seismic exploration has been cut. He wonders how government can achieve its vision for doubling oil production in Advance 2030. Siobhan Coady maintains Nalcor's offshore seismic exploration remains robust. #nlpoli
3921 2018-04-16 16:37:03 Considering cost of living, it appears both poor and rich people are better off in the US than in most places.  Norway appears to be a bit better off but their massive oil and gas reserves relative to their population make them an outlier on many metrics.
3922 2018-04-16 16:36:59 I know this place is sick of seeing me coming to get oil changed lmao this is the third car that I’ve brought. 
3923 2018-04-16 16:36:46 CBD Cookies and 250 mg CBD Oil have been Restocked
3924 2018-04-16 16:36:39 Most of subsidies are to make oil extraction more green. Also the LNG plant will replace coal in China.
3925 2018-04-16 16:36:34 people can't depend on poisoned lands, waters, air + ultimately their food sources- nothing can live on dirty oil but toss $$ + jobs (only in AB) out there + ppl flock- creating new industry must be difficult to envision
3926 2018-04-16 16:36:23 @weetabix Please introduce sustainable palm oil , @benm182 & I are big fans and we don't want to have to give up our bix X

3928 2018-04-16 16:36:09 Ryan Zinke: One more time, repeat after me: I am NOT the Secretary of Energy. I am a fraud heading a department that is supposed to CONSERVE public lands, not give them away to oil, coal, and gas to achieve "Energy Dominance."

3930 2018-04-16 16:35:29 @HardballChris Oil lobbyists kept the gas tax artificially low so they could keep their margins high.  Retailers barely made a penny a gallon. We'd have had World Class infrastructure if the gas taxes weren't at 1950's levels.
3931 2018-04-16 16:35:17 Oil spillage on Stanhope Rd towards Palmyra Rd on top of Stanhope Rd bridge, centre lane closed, proceed with caution.
3932 2018-04-16 16:35:11 Pipelines for diluted bitumen is make no economic sense anymore. The cost of shipping is going up as the IMO brings in low carbon/sulphur fuel regs for oil tanker ships. Refineries can get $144 bbl for diesel while Bitumen input is $26 bbl. Thats a $118 spread. #cdnpoli
3933 2018-04-16 16:35:06 Which will it be?
- Anthropogenic climate change
- Global thermonuclear war
- Deforestation
- Ocean acidification
- Anti-biotic-resistant diseases
- Peak oil and resource over-exploitation
- Rising sea levels
- Ongoing extinction event
- Rupture of the global supply chain
3934 2018-04-16 16:35:04 The oil in my hair can fry eggs 
3935 2018-04-16 16:35:04 Just paid for a cleaning at the dentist, had to drop a few bands on a retainer at the ortho, and now getting my oil changed. Anyone else need any money from me??? Seems like I'm just giving it away today!!!!!!!!!!!!

3937 2018-04-16 16:34:56 How much lye you put on five little oil?
3938 2018-04-16 16:34:50 Yes !! No oil I think that’s the best part ! Everything cooks faster too! I would definitely recommend it!!!
3939 2018-04-16 16:34:49 Like seriously Modi "JI" yoga day when our girls are being raped black and blue, u even spoke about cows but not a word on RAPE, why did the people vote for u? U don't care abt farmers not d girl child WHAT ARE U MADE OF? OIL!
3940 2018-04-16 16:34:44 Really?! Do you do hot oil treatments and stuff? My hair is long....it’s just DEF not as long as yours lol
3941 2018-04-16 16:34:42 1/2. Nutella (and a lot of products) is made with palm oil. But palm oil is like a massive destruction for the environment because of the resources it needs. Take a look on Asia forests where there a re a lot of palm forests. It's just ... how violent it is.
3942 2018-04-16 16:34:33 lmaooOOOO your dog is a legend that's great (also have you tried giving him cbd oil? i've heard it can help with calming 'em down)

3944 2018-04-16 16:34:09 As a science guy you should put this in context, not exaggerate it. It's a big deal for little Bahrain but in global context it's a drop in the world oil barrel. Plus it's several weeks old, has zilch to do w @TransMtn which has no need for an exit strategy.
Fake news from you???
3945 2018-04-16 16:34:05 Took the day off work - car needed an oil change and I just needed a day for myself. Still struggling with a lot of stuff and wrapping my head around other things. 
Trying to write, but it's been a few months and everything is a distraction...
3946 2018-04-16 16:33:58 Another WAR for a PIPELINE this one is Genie OIL .. WAKE UP
3947 2018-04-16 16:33:51 No oil?? I need one of these in my life. My fiancée bought a deep fryer but you have to put oil in it. And keep the oil in it. It’s hard to store anywhere in my house. I’m about to look into one of these bad boys.
3948 2018-04-16 16:33:40 Hi Paris, Our Body Oil has an internal flat plastic cap, with a small central hole which restricts the flow of the Oil, and ensures you are able to apply as much or as little oil as needed. Let us know if we can help with anything else! Best wishes, MB
3949 2018-04-16 16:33:37 Max #Syria is very good example to close @UN which is just a puppet

It will act strong when US internal politics hates its president

I am looking for one more #Libiya incident paid media & US join action to create a playground for weapons & oil control
3950 2018-04-16 16:33:36 This move by the feds to financially backstop Transmountain is a huge mistake for Alberta. It would basically nationalize the Alberta Oil industry by controlling the flow of oil. The pipeline is our Constitutional Right, not something for Trudeau to grant. @jkenney
3951 2018-04-16 16:33:35 Being an adult so trash. I gotta go get my oil changed today and I don’t wanna
3952 2018-04-16 16:33:29 Seen a lot of oil/pms supply deals Chad/Niger/Mali. Funny people. 

So they will see Sahara/Conoil/Talaveras....and it's you the president called.
3953 2018-04-16 16:33:28 تراني كبشرت كلامك يكون بعلمك عشان لا تنسي
3954 2018-04-16 16:33:17 More bullshit!
Aggression against Syria has everything to do with 
1) Oil deposits at the Golan Heights
2) Israeli expansionism
3) Perpetual money-making war
& nothing whatever to do with Assad who just happens to be a long-term client of Russia.
3955 2018-04-16 16:33:17 I need glittery oil to compliment my pretty ass tan. I’m tryna glow.

3957 2018-04-16 16:33:03 @McVities why do you use palm oil in jaffa cakes? I now can't look at a jaffa cake without thinking of the poor orang-utans made homeless buy the palm oil industry.
3958 2018-04-16 16:33:02 Let them compete with a carbon tax when other oil exporters have a carbon tax.
3959 2018-04-16 16:33:00 Politically, morally, humanitarianly (unless a long way away with promise of oil/trade), least willing to support UK citizens, most UK citizens that is.
Some UK citz -- Hunt, Johnson(s), Philip May, Gove seem pretty well supported.
3960 2018-04-16 16:32:53 For me it was motor oil leaking on my expensive scanner.
3961 2018-04-16 16:32:50 coba lu perjelas bang kenapa oil supply dunia ga aman kek sekarang kalo masih ada saddam?
3962 2018-04-16 16:32:49 Can someone please tell us whats really going on? One moment it was cable theft, then backlog, now oil leak. How about the people are told the truth! Is it too much to ask? I guess if you are a public official then it surely is too much to ask
3963 2018-04-16 16:32:37 any oil like that would work tbh,
3964 2018-04-16 16:32:27 So nothing to do with Dick Cheney's involvement with Genie gas and oil drilling for newly discovered reserves in the Golan heights between Syria and Israel then? 
I fyou want the truth about Syria go on wiki and look up Genie gas in syria and the syrian pipeline
3965 2018-04-16 16:32:25 No girl it’s the best!! You fry foods without any oil . So it’s like a healthier way to cook .
3966 2018-04-16 16:32:22 Hi Liz, we do lightly fry our products to set & crisp the coating. This also means our products can be cooked in your oven or under the grill instead of having to fry them at home meaning you don’t need to add any oil to them to prepare them. Hope that clears up the discussion 
3967 2018-04-16 16:32:21 My grand dtr is young enough to be on parents plan but 1 parent is on Medicare from Disability and one parent is a Waitress so there is no Coverage .. Grand Dtr having female issues that #Cannabis Oil could fix but we do not have access to Medical or Plant based care #Texas
3968 2018-04-16 16:32:13 @wsbtv 
Um, we get our oil from Canada, not the ME.
Big Oil is screwing consumers.
3969 2018-04-16 16:32:12 You Know what I think all this US and NATO countries are controlled by Huge Weapon manufacturing , oil and gas companies . Since they are all in such huge debt and not being able to pay back they are literally starting a WW3 . This time the war will be in the middle East.

3973 2018-04-16 16:31:34 Vital interest to your billionaire cronies in the oil industry?  Certainly.  Vital interest to the campaign donations you receive from big oil and big money?  Certainly.  Even remotely in the interests of every living being on this planet, which is suffering?  Not even close.
3974 2018-04-16 16:31:31 Oil Prices recovered some ground, but prices were still down on the day as investor concern waned about escalating tensions in the Middle East following air strikes on Syria over the weekend
3975 2018-04-16 16:31:29 To me it's sort of comes down to fighting Wars and relying on the Middle East for oil. But I'll be honest I don't know that much about either
3976 2018-04-16 16:31:29 Could you please clarify? Are you talking about the tankers bringing oil to Canada for refining, or the ones taking oil to other countries?
3977 2018-04-16 16:31:20 You mean hemp oil derived from the seeds...CBD containing oil from the flowers/leaves is a controlled substance.
3978 2018-04-16 16:31:06 すこ
3979 2018-04-16 16:31:05 Also slow down you outer perimeter to 20mm/sec.  & a TINY amount of oil may help.  Moisten (NOT SOAK) a paper towel with cooking oil, fold it around the filament & clip it into place. Never oiled before, but it worked beautifully in my case.  BTW, jammed on MK2 as well
3980 2018-04-16 16:31:00 You do realise that it’s our meddling 50 -70 years ago when we had no oil, is what caused all the mess in the first place????
3981 2018-04-16 16:30:53 CHONGS CHOICE NEW FULL GRAM OIL CARTRIDGES ARE 10% OFF TODAY!!
3982 2018-04-16 16:30:52 People think I'm a bad person. Oh no. I just want mean people to boil in oil, their bodies dragged through town then burn in hell
3983 2018-04-16 16:30:47 You could try some clove oil. Hope it's not tooooo painful x
3984 2018-04-16 16:30:46 What difference does that make. Oil block license not renewable. It means it will be given to another bidder. This time a FULANI MAN. How does non renewal of Obj, IBB and TY Danjuman licenses improve the life of the average Nigeria. So Buhari govt is all about vendetta.
3985 2018-04-16 16:30:43 Def just finessed a cheaper oil change:) helps being cute 
3986 2018-04-16 16:30:39 Lots of maybes if Alberta separated. Would the USA even recognize Alberta as another country? They said they wouldn't recognize an independent Quebec. But again, the USA is hungry for oil so who knows?
3987 2018-04-16 16:30:36 Sorry but I have purchased my last BMW due to the maintenance coverage you changed a few years ago. I loved it when it was tires and gas for 50k miles. Now it just like a Chevy. 3/36 and oil changes only. Thanks but I'll go elsewhere now.
3988 2018-04-16 16:30:33 What do you think about Suncor Energys plan to build robot trucks for its #Alberta #oil sands?
3989 2018-04-16 16:30:31 Olive oil therapy for two-three days walang liguan babad lang sa olive oil.  Pwede din olive oil tuwing gabi pero for one week or two hehehe.
3990 2018-04-16 16:30:30 We don’t buy it. Oil companies buy it. They will continue to buy cheaper oil. It’s called the free market. Unless you nationalize the oil companies they will continue to buy cheaper oil.

3992 2018-04-16 16:30:26 You mean like oil and movies and airplanes?  China is making it's own airplanes, we should stop exporting oil while importing, and the video piracy of movies defeats the export revenue of those.  We import a huge amount more than export.

4008 2018-04-16 16:28:39 So sad.  I found out yesterday that I can no longer use #bathandbodyworks products. They have changed their formula in all their products to coconut oil or avocado.

4019 2018-04-16 16:26:50 Pope Francis is the embodiment of real Christian values. All these Evangelical leaders should take a lesson. They are nothing more than snake oil salesmen who peddle division and damnation and run corporations they call “churches” to bilk the scared/ desperate out of savings.

4022 2018-04-16 16:25:57 The Rags keep losing the money spent argument....... but Nett spend, errrr we make our own money, errrr 20 times......... then comes out the Ace card - Oil Money!!!!! Yes we’ve spent, but look what we got & what you wasted on big spends
4023 2018-04-16 16:25:54 Castor oil is thick... y’all told me that. What y’all didn’t tell me was how much it stank. 
4024 2018-04-16 16:25:53 I support Tulsi's STOP Act when my incumbent does not. Sharing her stance was exactly what I said it was, 45 is now a war criminal, whether for reasons we want or not. We bombed them for their oil, not to help the people there. Proof: 18 Syrian refugees accepted in US in 2018.
4025 2018-04-16 16:25:53 Justice or income from rebuilding projects and oil revenue?
4026 2018-04-16 16:25:50 @theresa_may In our national interest as in what ...oil pipeline, sales of bombs, come on sya what those interests are because it certainly is not in our interests to kill people to cause war to put our own children at risk!
4027 2018-04-16 16:25:43 Bouta get this good ol oil change
4028 2018-04-16 16:25:38 Sadly it’s not about Syrian citizens ... it’s more about Syrian oil
4029 2018-04-16 16:25:15 Irretrievably? This doofus could change his mind before he lands in Paris
 All depends what his boss Butts says. I can just see the news release "after further review the Government of Canada can no longer support those nasty oil companies"
4030 2018-04-16 16:24:56 Yes, I can. He was in the perfect position to get pipelines completed & to make investments in our industry’s future. The oil industry was booming but instead of being pro-active he let it slide. He knew like everyone else that the boom would end. So no, it’s not about the media.

4042 2018-04-16 16:23:51 @TheCurrentCBC

When @ElizabethMay took that frivolous/photo-op small plane flight over Ottawa for an interview with @tomclarkGPA (during a "Plane Talk" segment a few years ago) what does she think the fuel was derived from?

I am certain it was a derivative of oil.

4043 2018-04-16 16:23:48 Congratulations to @ManCity for winning the EPL, best team wins the league every time. 

Must be stated though if oil money had poured in Altrincham FC then it would indeed be them celebrating winning the EPL with a party down at Moss Lane, probably to more fans.

4049 2018-04-16 16:23:00 As a female fan I was really dismayed by this whole Saudi thing. I understand they want to grow the market, or take a huge wad of oil money, but an all-male card is so regressive. I would be all over Shayna / Carmella too; great idea!
4050 2018-04-16 16:22:46 Manic panic is vegan so for my hair which holds color cuz it red naturally it comes out nicely. I use Cantu and shea moisture products and that’s it. Tea tree oil to seal everything everyday when I do my hair. If you color yours just make sure you moisturize it that’s all.

4058 2018-04-16 16:21:44 Follow the money - If our economic interests are threatened (London, Paris, Iraqi oil) we are quick to react. Syria, Yemen Congo? Not so much. And all could be economic partners if they had a few years of stability - but no one takes the long view.
4059 2018-04-16 16:21:33 OIL!!!!!! Vegetable oil or any oil will get him@loose!!!! My cats got wrapped in fly paper once!
4060 2018-04-16 16:21:32 Did you try coconut oil?
4061 2018-04-16 16:21:29 I want to see more companies actually CELEBRATING cannabis. Use pot leaves in the packaging, educate us on hemp seed oil and how good it is for our skin and hair. Don’t call it Kush though and try to get a sale on a lie.
4062 2018-04-16 16:21:27 I literally don’t know how I ever lived without coconut oil 
4063 2018-04-16 16:21:12 what’s your favorite essential oil blend to diffuse that helps with your anxiety? (also, do you wear any essential oils that help with anxiety?) thanks so much, sending hugs to Nashville! (aka, my favorite city. best latte: Crema Coffee.. THE BEST)
4064 2018-04-16 16:21:12 i need cocoa butter and olive oil
4065 2018-04-16 16:21:11 What's worse, some Vegans were suggesting an alternative which required palm oil. Which is so, so awful and selfish, just for the sake of their morals!
4066 2018-04-16 16:21:03 Maybe try olive oil instead? (I don't know what beard oil is)
4067 2018-04-16 16:20:47 I'm serious when i lost my brother , my anxiety was at a all time high.  There were times it would get hard to breathe. I tried lots of things.   But never wanted to go with pills.  The lavender definitely helped. Lotions bath wash.but definitely a personal oil bottle
4068 2018-04-16 16:20:41 I think we’re on the same planet bud. Made lots of money for over 30 yrs from oil and gas but things are changing and people still have too earn a living wage.

4076 2018-04-16 16:19:36 Yes, all that lovely Canadian and Albertan government money will be snapped up by Kinder Morgan. They can now build a pipeline that will sit empty most of the time because nobody wants bitumen when there is lots of light crude oil around.
4077 2018-04-16 16:19:33 Just watched a firetruck get legit baptized, oil, incense, holy water in golden orbs & all, here in Catholic Rhineland, & it begs two questions: what do you fear will happen when the firetruck loses sight of Christ, & exactly what bit do I chop off to make my firetruck Jewish?
4078 2018-04-16 16:19:28 B/c Harper was greedy & lazy as hell while our oil industry was booming. He wasn’t pro-active at all. R u saying he couldn’t get pipelines completed b/c he faced the same opposition as Trudeau? If so, that would be hypocritical.
4079 2018-04-16 16:19:23 My guesses: wars, famine, terrorism. Which would be a big deal in America if Africa had oil.
4080 2018-04-16 16:19:22 I believe he tried to suggest everybody to develop ICBMs if they don't want to be invaded by democracy as soon as oil or precious metals are found on their land.
4081 2018-04-16 16:19:11 Too often, the media demonizes certain fields, but mining, oil and conservation groups all deserve the same access to representation.

4085 2018-04-16 16:18:37 Just chill dawg. I was gone say use vegetable oil but that made more sense 
4086 2018-04-16 16:18:35 Pan-roasted potatoes. The trick is to preboil (not cook) for 5 minutes only, cool them for 20 minutes and finish in the pan with oil, medium-low heat, about 12-15 minutes. Turn after every 3 minutes. Do not add salt until eating time. Salt will kill the crunch.
4087 2018-04-16 16:18:33 Yup, but it's around twice the potency of your average LP CBD oil. Avidekel is 20-25mg/CBD per ml and ours comes in at around 50-60mg/CBD per ml.
4088 2018-04-16 16:18:22 Bruh I just got a new dry herb / dab / oil / vape pen I’m literally so happy

4094 2018-04-16 16:17:09 Ask how good it is to sit in Quebec and continually get propped up by Western Canadian oil? We have a long ways to go before oil gets overtaken by cleaner, cheaper, efficient, dependable technology.

4096 2018-04-16 16:17:00 @SheaMoisture will the red palm oil line be available anywhere other than Walmart? I avoid shopping there because of their horrible treatment of employees. I got this line through @CurlKit, and I’m excited to try it out.

4110 2018-04-16 16:15:13 Bout to go get an oil change I suppose
4111 2018-04-16 16:15:05 what about our future environment here in BC? That doesn't count in your equation? We are fighting for the soil and air and ocean, our very lives. It is sad that a few barrels of dirty oil are being traded for our future children's very existence.
4112 2018-04-16 16:14:58 This Twitter feed is dedicated to preserving our BC coastline from the eventuality of a bitumen oil spill if the Kinder-Morgan pipeline is allowed to proceed.  The AB Tar Sands are a dirty oil product that contributes to climate change and Canada needs to end this project now.
4113 2018-04-16 16:14:56 Canadian indigenous lands, the Pacific coast, the Salish Sea, the Fraser River, wild salmon and killer whales are more important than an inferior oil which costs more to process and refine! An oil broker in Asia doesn't want Alberta bitumen.

4115 2018-04-16 16:14:43 True, but a simmering feud does increase oil prices and that serves the rent seeking class in both countries.

4117 2018-04-16 16:14:36 According to President Obama oil prices go up when the economy is good and down when it’s bad. Since he is the expert on everything economic, the economy must have sucked most of his term and is getting much better now.

4154 2018-04-16 16:12:17 Narerender kasi yung fat as you cook it, kumbaga natutunaw kaya nadadagdagan yung oil. Since ang tendency ng oil is to settle sa taas, pwede mo gawin is to scoop out and throw away yung excess oil using a spoon. Para lang mas healthy ng onti when you serve it :)
4155 2018-04-16 16:12:16 Reads smart and fancy This is just a conservative pitch against corporate gain taxes. Money is money even if the government takes it from me. And yes they can spend it, all the money the war and oil profiteers make off government spending is proof of that.

4158 2018-04-16 16:12:03 In U.S. heating is mostly natural gas or oil. Weather affects electricity bills far more through cooling than heating.

4168 2018-04-16 16:11:14 True. I hear they are going to be turning some of their other CBD strains into oil and they'll come in at around 100$ per 40 ml bottle.

4172 2018-04-16 16:10:41 Actually, by #TransMountain's own QRA estimate, there is a 10% chance of a major marine oil spill occurring over the life of the project. And in their (credible) worst case scenario, 45% of the DilBit spilled would not be cleaned up.
4173 2018-04-16 16:10:38 When you are anti oil and really don’t want the pipeline this is the inaction a gov’t takes.
4174 2018-04-16 16:10:32 anyway, this rosehip oil cleared my skin, raised my gpa, filled my tank, and made me dinner

4177 2018-04-16 16:10:29 시험공부해요....ㅠㅅㅠ
4178 2018-04-16 16:10:25 What a pile of shit. Giving billions to a foreign oil company. This single pipeline won’t save the tar sands. It’s insanity. A govt handout to billionaires who will rape the land and then leave it when they’re done. We’re on the hook for all of it. All the risk, small reward.

4180 2018-04-16 16:10:18 And you are pouring oil on the flames.

3: get a NEW razor, men’s or women’s, but with 5 blades.
4: shave in the direction the hair grows
5: after shaving, use rubbing alcohol on a cotton pad and gently dab the area to close the pores/avoid rash

4193 2018-04-16 16:09:16 Yes, I worry about the likelihood for complacency & lack of long-term strategy. An immediate use would be to pay down debt. Interest payments this year > 500 million dinars. Also, I think current oil output is 200 K bpd (50 local + 150 share from abu safa)

4197 2018-04-16 16:08:58 The Nellie Johnstone is considered the first commercial oil well so that distinction is correct!

4199 2018-04-16 16:08:40 Add to this the tepid support of Oil and Gas by the #abndp - which is too little, too late and a transparent abandonment of stated #ndp policy in an attempt to cling to power... this is all about maintaining power for all 3 players and nothing to with environment and #FN..
4200 2018-04-16 16:08:37 Really? Rather have tanker trucks and train tankers transporting the oil. Where do you greenies get off thinking that we are ready to kill jobs and the economy. there is no alternative yet so stop making this a human sacrifice for your own ideas.
4201 2018-04-16 16:08:24 Not protest good news to all , as they need  present government and oil companies elites to rule them forever , after breath in death who rule  no problem , the companies still have options to live and Government's still continue to rules no problems to all good news !!!

4215 2018-04-16 16:07:47 Yeah, Saw that they lowered the price of Avidekel oil to $150, but it also used to be in a 50ml bottle, but now it's 40ml.

4219 2018-04-16 16:07:33 Let's be honest here America & Russia don't care one bit about how the Syrian people are treated, they care about Syrian Oil & that's it.
4220 2018-04-16 16:07:32 It makes so much sense to legalise this. Especially the oil that helps people with arthritis and ME. Medical marijuana should definitely, be at long last be legalised.

me, a leftist, watching bloomberg tv: why are the correspondents saying that venezuela not tapping its vast oil reserve is criminal

also me: because this channel is about making money, not promoting environmental consciousness

4226 2018-04-16 16:06:55 This off day has consisted of doctors appts and getting my oil changed, and I think id rather be at work.

4233 2018-04-16 16:06:08 Trump illegally acted without Congressional approval before hand, u r all letting him get away with it, what he did was an act of War with real adult consequences at the cost of 224,000,000 tax payers $ to accomplish help for Putin/Trump Oil Pipeline
4234 2018-04-16 16:06:02 It would be a #MadMax world. Our #society and our #economy would begin to  fall apart very quickly because everything depends on #fuel to make an economy run, which is under #threat as the escalating #conflict in #Syria threatens to cripple #supplychannels of #oil
4235 2018-04-16 16:05:56 Maybe there could be a 4 to 10 ratio shown and a 2 to 5 ratio in one of the situations. Also, I think I agree on changing the units, but then the situations may need to be revised. What about cups of sugar vs flour in cookie recipes? 1 cup of oil seems excessive!
4236 2018-04-16 16:05:40 I agree partly, I believe that the PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION had their eye on 7 countries to establish pipelines. It has everything to do with the oil and taking oil business from the Russians and being top dog in Europe.
4237 2018-04-16 16:05:30 I LITERALLY TOLD HIM THAT i go through a bottle of conditioner every two weeks max and i put hair oil in after every time i get my hair wet and i am STILL out here w the hermione hair so he can eat twelve dicks
4238 2018-04-16 16:05:23 I used warm compress, with a little unrefined coconut oil.
4239 2018-04-16 16:05:19 Just don't buy the Rex (tangie) oil. The quality of the oil is worth it at the new lower prices in my opinion. Some of the best I've tried in both taste and effects. Deliciously terpy

4242 2018-04-16 16:05:05 How much does Kinder Morgan and Koch brothers donate to the Liberal Party? Tarsands require huge gov't subsidies: cost of production is far above selling it at a $13/barrel discount below the WTI oil price. This deal looks like wildly corrupt, self-destructive corporate welfare.
4243 2018-04-16 16:04:57 Suncor is refining their oil at home.  This is the solution.  Jobs and wealth.  
a no brainer.  Look at Suncors stock and success by refining their own oil.
4244 2018-04-16 16:04:51 not the 1st time...we export oil and import fuel, esp. now that we only have 1 refinery in Vzla. It also happened during PDVSA's strike +15 years ago...
4245 2018-04-16 16:04:44 I know its late I just want to explain. Bts come from a small company. They were poor they had to use suite cases as tables. They ate bread with oil from a tuna can. About 3 or 4 years ago they were on the streets handing out flyers and asking people to attend their free concert
4246 2018-04-16 16:04:43 I have short hair all I gotta do is put oil on it and brush it 
4247 2018-04-16 16:04:38 I'm so embarrassed that this person represents the NDP. I know she is screwed because Alberta is now irrevocably invested in oil. They don't want to be ranchers and farmers. So get into green technology dummies. More money in the long run or fail in oil.

4258 2018-04-16 16:03:52 1) why we aren't winning ,why are we in Middle East ? Democrats , obstructed the ban. Immigration reform ,oil drilling , border security ,everify for money laundering , stopping flow of drugs , undermining us with China ,extreme getting, social media access

4263 2018-04-16 16:02:59 I used too much coconut oil
4264 2018-04-16 16:02:58 The tar sands are the most expensive way to get oil and when the price of oil drops, they’re a liability. @stephenharper knew it, that’s why he was trying to unload them to Chinese companies.
4265 2018-04-16 16:02:38 Pipelines are definitely not better for the people who live on this coast. And more oil, Canadian or otherwise, is not better for the world

4302 2018-04-16 15:59:56 Victoria's tertiary treatment plant is underway so not an issue. The discharge was protested for many years. Science and experience show that land oil spills are devastating & marine spills cannot be contained or cleaned-up. Risks are too great. No further expansion.

4305 2018-04-16 15:59:35 Let's hear more about phasing out of the Oil Industry...not environmental stewardship. Can't have it both ways.

It's been a long day.

4314 2018-04-16 15:58:51 Plus a barrel of oil is now worth 1/3 of what it was when the sanctions were in place and can hurt the bankrupting Ayatollahs regime a lot more now
4315 2018-04-16 15:58:44 And considering it only takes 16  tankers to equal the pollution of all the cars in the world, maybe not a great idea to have more of them idle in the inlet for days, carrying oil or not..
4316 2018-04-16 15:58:41 I made some bacon in garlic oil.

4321 2018-04-16 15:58:17 I’ll watch it later but I’m concerned we are being dragged into something far bigger than it appears. What is our goal exactly? Is the US ultimately gunning for Iran? Is it about oil? Why are we involved? Is war our answer to everything? I’m not convinced in this case.
4322 2018-04-16 15:58:15 Russia get an ENORMOUS trade advantage with a devalued ruble ... selling all those consumer goods they supply the world with, like heavy, unusable crude oil and surplus diamonds!!!

4327 2018-04-16 15:57:54 Israel and SA gain from war on Syria. If we pull out, Israel looses its free ground support. We weaponize the terrorist rebels. Follow motive. Israel wants Canaan. Already stealing oil. Russia, Turkey, Iran were stabilizing at high price to Syria. Damn the dictators.

4330 2018-04-16 15:57:30 Who gets the fracking oil & gas regions ?
4331 2018-04-16 15:57:23 Now we find out the real reason for all of this: Ottawa wants to control the flow of oil. Justin finishes what his father started. They subsidize it so that they can control the pipeline. It would be better if there was no pipeline than if there was one owned by Ottawa.

4341 2018-04-16 15:56:22 When Byzantium lost Syria to Islam, the supply of olive oil was cut off to Constantinople. The people of Const. used olive oil for light, heat, food and many other things.  Sound vaguely familiar?

4380 2018-04-16 15:53:02 Canada relies on oil. There should be a way to transport it but government should rethink the path of the pipeline and move it through a non populated area. In the event of a disaster, not only is the environment destroyed but life will be too. Burnaby and area is too populated
4381 2018-04-16 15:52:58 As a macro asset-allocator, if you want to hedge your portfolio against geopolitical risk, your prime candidate is oil, especially if that risk is in the Middle East.

4391 2018-04-16 15:52:17 1) You fail to understand foreign affairs. You obstruct , immigration reform,border security,,Iran deal, stopping drug trade , money laundering NGOs ,humans trafficking, and oil production .these actions keep us in Middle East . Educate yourself .

4395 2018-04-16 15:51:52 While extenuating circumstances like drought and oil  prices have certainly worsened the situation, it's clear there's a  larger force behind Venezuela's woes.
The force that is driving Venezuela into the ground is socialism.
4396 2018-04-16 15:51:51 The Canadian Federal government plans to heavily subsidize a pipeline to the west coast of British Columbia. Does that mean any oil shipped to the USA will have extra tariffs imposed? Certainly an unfair advantage over domestic producers. #USPolitics
4397 2018-04-16 15:51:50 Ouch. I've a Ford Focus SE 2010, 120k miles, not one problem. Change my oil, filters, and fluids when they need to be done.
4398 2018-04-16 15:51:48 Something to ponder. Since Trudeau, Notely and Horgan have indicated in the past their disliking of pipelines and oil... why the push for the taxpayer to take the risk over from #KM? Enough protest against the proposed government payout, and presto!, added reason to kill project.
4399 2018-04-16 15:51:44 I think oil has been running so hot, it might be pulling back, doubt 66.33 holds. All depends if it's a deep or shallow pullback. Can see both scenarios possible.
4400 2018-04-16 15:51:39 Saudi Arabia is Sunni we stay friendly with them because they backed the Petro dollar with oil monetize everything and keep oil prices at is strict cost in exchange we fight all their Wars notice we demonize Iran who is Shiite who is she ate mortal enemies of Saudi Arabia

4402 2018-04-16 15:51:04 It's a cooker that's an alternative to all oil based cooking options! Like it can make crispy chips with little or no oil. It also cooks super quickly, like we fried some frozen gyōza dumplings in 5 minutes flat! Only gripe is it is a little small for a whole family. X
4403 2018-04-16 15:51:03 We know it is the oil and natural gas. We know that you used the nerve agent yourself and are framing Russia for it
4404 2018-04-16 15:50:46 Let’s be honest only reason why our warmongering politicians want to go to war in Syria is because they have some sort of military complex with Russia and oil .

4408 2018-04-16 15:50:18 No suspecting about it I think.  These criminals, in the pockets of big oil, don't even try to be slick. Their impunity is not a bug, it's a feature.

4430 2018-04-16 15:48:21 For the love of god people please do not bring your car in to have the oil changed and have no gas in it. If I can't pull it in to the garage cause it can't even start cause it has no gas not my problem anymore. I will not put gas in it for you.
4431 2018-04-16 15:48:17 China pegs its currency, which is its right as a sovereign state, but the ruble is free-floating, and its devaluation was driven by sanctions and drop in oil prices some years ago. Of course, the Russian gov't welcomed it, but it's US actions that made it so!

4433 2018-04-16 15:48:05 My brother-in-law is obsessed with him. But its because he's a fellow giant and can feel his pain. Lol
4434 2018-04-16 15:48:04 Our country is not broken. I’d like to remind ppl that Harper had over a decade along with the oil industry booming to get pipelines completed. He was LAZY & greedy & had no motivation to protect AB  for when the boom would end, & he knew it would. HE put us in this situation.
4435 2018-04-16 15:47:37 Does this beard oil thing work?
4436 2018-04-16 15:47:32 Conservatives: we stand by the workers to get good paying jobs for economic prosperity

BC: we don't want the pipeline

Conservatives: shut off their oil and let the workers suffer! The taxpayers opinions dont matter anyways!

You hypocritical capitalist shitbag
4437 2018-04-16 15:47:32 Reads smart and fancy This is just a conservative pitch against corporate gain taxes. Money is money even if the government takes it from me. And yes they can spend it, all the money the war and oil profiteers make off government spending is proof of that.

4439 2018-04-16 15:47:20 Do you have links to research into cannabis oil used for COPD?
4440 2018-04-16 15:47:17 Also: we won’t be burning all that oil. China will. It’ll be their job to meet their targets.
4441 2018-04-16 15:46:58 The price of a 110ml REN Rose Bath Oil depresses me.
4442 2018-04-16 15:46:56 Well, on this one we agree!
On the pipeline front though, I would prefer that Canada refine its own oil instead of shipping jobs to other countries. THIS environmentalist would prefer to see refined product in the Salish Sea than dilbit.
4443 2018-04-16 15:46:56 I was allowed 10% off my carryon fee for changing the oil on the left engine. Great deal. They told me if I brought gas cans of jet fuel I’ll get extra miles on my frequent flier account.
4444 2018-04-16 15:46:51 Don’t agree with little Kenney on much but on this he is right on. Quebec acccepts Middle East oil 24/7 in tankers but won’t let Alberta oil get to market????! WTF is that?
4445 2018-04-16 15:46:48 It is not the fixing that is time consuming but the bleeding of the system. It takes time 12 - 24 hours. At the end of the 12 hours we detected an oil leak on a new transformer. A section of the transformer is now being replace and we hoping for ETR of 5 pm on Tuesday.

4451 2018-04-16 15:46:13 Ketogenic diet with a healthy amount of MCT oil. MCT oil and butter in coffee is a great boost for energy and focus.
4452 2018-04-16 15:46:04 Turkey was busted supplying Chlorine to the Rebels.
Turkey funded rebels, bought stolen Syrian Oil from Rebels
Turkey working with rebels against kurds to annex N.Syria

US building kurdish state in N.Syria, Assad defending Syria.
Turkey needs conflict between US & Assad
4453 2018-04-16 15:46:03 Well oil machine.
4454 2018-04-16 15:45:59 I will say that, Vitamin E & Castor Oil has been helping me grow my short ass eyelashes
4455 2018-04-16 15:45:56 Didn't use any oil I think. I can't remember exactly :p

4469 2018-04-16 15:44:21 Foreign money like the Koch’s. Big financial win for them if our oil only goes to the US.
4470 2018-04-16 15:44:19 Why I wait until 45 mins before my shift to shower, lather on oil, do makeup, do hair, and get my scrubs on making it to work on time is beyond me. But I’m somehow an elite expert @ it.
4471 2018-04-16 15:44:18 Oil recovered some ground on Monday, but prices were still down on the day as investor concern waned about escalating tensions in the Middle East following air strikes on Syria over the weekend.
4472 2018-04-16 15:44:15 So he can talk to Big Oil privately

4477 2018-04-16 15:43:59 Franklin Graham is just as big a conman as his father was and trump is. Snake oil sales men hiding behind false patriotism and bibles.
4478 2018-04-16 15:43:53 Ehhhh in need of a oil change pronto
4479 2018-04-16 15:43:47 Cause nothing else matters but oil.  I think parliament can walk and chew gum at the same time.
4480 2018-04-16 15:43:43 We’re “all of the above,” including oil.

4483 2018-04-16 15:43:24 First agenda, remove trudeau's legalization of all T.H.C. related products. Second open up the flow of our resources to world markets. Build 10 refineries cost to cost. Employ indigenous, millennials and me to encourage growth in the oil and gas sector.
4484 2018-04-16 15:43:21 Oil isn't going anywhere for at least another generation. How it's used & the mfg process will evolve but he raw material still has to come from the earth. Btw, nice pic. You know what would look good in that valley? Wind generators or solar arrays.

4489 2018-04-16 15:42:58 The UK and USA..France ...Qatar...Saudi Arabia are members of the Orwellian named "Friends of Syria"
It's aim is regime change and to demonise Assad.
It's all about pushing oil pipelines from Gulf States through Syria to European markets.
4490 2018-04-16 15:42:57 Where is the judgment on the trips, excessive security, lobbying oil in another country for a department that he is not in and bringing everyone but the kitchen sink to Paris instead of curtailing visit for Moraco!?
4491 2018-04-16 15:42:51 but but but @EPAScottPruitt needs a secret comms channel to speak with his swampy oil and gas buddies

how else is he supposed to take orders, when he doesn't want anyone to know what the orders are or who they're coming from?
4492 2018-04-16 15:42:47 You like your fries with palm oil?
4493 2018-04-16 15:42:46 Consider that both parties are the party of big business. Oil and gas companies, defense and intelligence contractors, and the finance industry are all conservative. They’re poisoning, evicting, and drone bombing people at home and abroad.
4494 2018-04-16 15:42:46 D-

Did you try and drink oil?
4495 2018-04-16 15:42:32 What shit? baby oil?
4496 2018-04-16 15:42:31 Just beard oil.
4497 2018-04-16 15:42:30 And olive oil stains garments!  Blast, have you ever tried to get an olive oil stain out of a black wool?  Impossible!
4498 2018-04-16 15:42:27 Cool, I need a oil change and could possibly use new tires. Can I get some of someone else's hard-earned money? We didn't even ask family for help with our medical expenses
4499 2018-04-16 15:42:22 how do you get your oil?
4500 2018-04-16 15:42:22 When your Saudi oil sheikh donates extra dollars for script/momentum on your account
4501 2018-04-16 15:42:05 And, u felt this way with Harper as well? He had over a decade, oil industry boom & yet he DIDN’T get pipelines completed! Partisan much? Harper was lazy & greedy. Trudeau is faced with a totally different scenario, the oil industry is not booming! BTW, that’s not in his control.
4502 2018-04-16 15:42:03 Oil.
4503 2018-04-16 15:41:59 As I sit here waiting on oil change (dialasys)this weekend i did soul searching and well i don't mean hurt any e feel g but i have get myself  and landlords back being happy..so plz if u bothered then tlk about it if it then sit back and watch the  $$pile up
4504 2018-04-16 15:41:58 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
4505 2018-04-16 15:41:58 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
4506 2018-04-16 15:41:55 I LOVE OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING!
4507 2018-04-16 15:41:54 The other potential fallacy in this strategy is many ppl who study this say you can’t actually meet Paris targets and also burn all the oil. Coherency of this strategy requires ignoring a lot of ppl saying there are holes in the plan.
4508 2018-04-16 15:41:49 What’s wrong with them?? RT @TellFamous: if y’all care bout your cars so much don’t go get your oil change at 5 minutes.

4511 2018-04-16 15:41:20 Just listened to the podcast of it - too bad they let Ms. May spew her batch of lies and keep harping about how all environmental reviews are flawed just helps create uncertainty kind like Trump does. Her saying there is no market for this oil is just plain wrong.
4512 2018-04-16 15:41:14 how to get me to immediately and completely not care about something: 
say "this is really important for the oil industry..."

4517 2018-04-16 15:40:54 エアプか？
4518 2018-04-16 15:40:39 Exactly right, but who needs oil in Quebec when the Feds throw that much  $$$$ at you? Quebecers get hammered at the pumps though.

4528 2018-04-16 15:39:52 We really need to apply the lessons of the Nuremberg trials more consistently to corporate regulation. Command responsibility for the corporate officers and superior orders for the employees and management. RICO for gross criminality like Enron or oil corps wrt climate change.
4529 2018-04-16 15:39:41 @TOTALNigeria Good day to one the biggest oil firm in Nigeria. Please I wish to ask a question.
4530 2018-04-16 15:39:35 ไม่มีตังงงงงงงงงงงงงงงงงงงแล้ว
4531 2018-04-16 15:39:28 Do not put butter or oil on the burns as it may trap heat &amp; cause burns to worsen. Instead hold the burnt area under cold running water.
4532 2018-04-16 15:39:23 Peppermint oil and a nice steamy bath for this terrible cold 
4533 2018-04-16 15:39:13 Agree govt should support job growth but not when the jobs produce pollution we can’t control, affect climate change, kill whales etc. We can no longer disrespect the earth and the critical job we have been given to nurture it.            Continued oil dependency is foolish
4534 2018-04-16 15:39:10 Then your first objective should be to stop the 400,000 barrels of oil from being shipped to the Vancouver Island on diesel-fueled vessels.   There is also one natural gas pipeline to the Island. Does Canada know about this?

You know, same ones we dropped pallets of weapons off of C130s/C17s too? And the ones we continue to feed 'til this day. Yeah, you people also stated Saddam poisoned his ppl
4538 2018-04-16 15:38:22 you cant eat or swim in money.  im sorry if you are invested but oil will run out and clean technology exist now. increasing production of tar that literally kills everything is bad for Canadians.   I support #beautifulbritishcolumbia
4539 2018-04-16 15:38:19 Natural resources, with oil as the leader may be a small percentage of GDP, but fuels the two largest sectors... services and manufacturing.  It is becoming clear that the Liberal agenda is to reduce oil dependency even further, and to accelerate renewable sources.

4541 2018-04-16 15:38:11 Umm... the figures Salmond forecast were ridiculously optimistic figures, and the crash in oil prices clearly showed the folly of basing an economy on a volatile commodity. He was out by £155m per *day*.
4542 2018-04-16 15:38:02 'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
4543 2018-04-16 15:37:56 For soup, cook cubed scallions in oil, then simmer with beans, thyme, beef broth and black beans. Top with parsley.
4544 2018-04-16 15:37:56 So cool. Funny thing is I can eat peppermints, just the raw oil and scent that kicks off allergies
4545 2018-04-16 15:37:51 naw what i'm saying is there was oil on the floor but the rain made it move down the path, causing it to look all stretched like that
4546 2018-04-16 15:37:41 the hate from oil has now been switched to banks. this is all quant algo's and the insane stupid fact that BOTH $BAC @BankofAmerica & $JPM @jpmorgan do NOT use their buybacks aggressively to fight this crap.

I can't write more emails complaining. UGH

4549 2018-04-16 15:37:24 my skin is surprisingly good considering i ate tofu and vegetables dipped in boiling hot spicy oil over the weekend, so is mercury out of gatorade or is the rest of my life about to fall apart
4550 2018-04-16 15:37:04 Técnicamente cada nuevo maximo de producción es un nuevo punto Peak Oil en potencia.
4551 2018-04-16 15:37:03 Tried some new stuff with making curry last night. Doing it the traditional way with grinding spices took too long and I didn't get the flavors I went. Went with what looked like a spice paste, mixed it with oil for an instant roux. Tasted absolutely delicious.
4552 2018-04-16 15:36:46 Christ, May's now attempting to bore us into submission by chewing through one of her shitey essays to get her out of actually giving any proper account of her fake war for oil and the rest. Puppet PM. #SyriaAirStrike
4553 2018-04-16 15:36:46 nope. your motor oil
4554 2018-04-16 15:36:28 LIKE??? That's what I figured it'd do so I'll probably have to cave and get my lazy ass up and get something. Now I'm out here thinking about going back to just vitamin e oil 
4555 2018-04-16 15:36:28 Hell's own hell. Naked and covered with oil.

4557 2018-04-16 15:36:19 It basically was a con just based on how many events we did in 2 days. 3 suiting events totalling over 8 hrs of suiting. Plus all the dinners and lunches. And the dreaded truffle oil.
4558 2018-04-16 15:36:14 All the color is oil from the road/driveway

4560 2018-04-16 15:36:09 And EVERYTHING you named required oil and/or gas to function. Are we fishing with sail boats and off loading container ships with hand cranked cranes? Moving film set last around the city by foot? Oil is still a required necessity.
4561 2018-04-16 15:36:07 Btw oil is not going a way anytime soon. The problem is that both sides think it is all or nothing. That you cannot have both. Climate change is an issue of too much carbon being burnt.  Even in the future there is going to be a place for oil.
4562 2018-04-16 15:36:05 @LBC @IainDale The ‘gang leader’ is informing her ‘mules’ that they are justified in carrying ‘knives and guns’  for use against their ‘postcode’ enemies - given the billions of £ ‘s of drug trade/oil and gas wealth out there and up for grabs. Only the best armed can win.
4563 2018-04-16 15:35:55 Thats funny. You start supporting City when they get there oil money.
4564 2018-04-16 15:35:53 Why do conservatives always think it's okay to insinuate that all liberals do drugs. My railroad ties are used outside the home as retaining walls no I do not huff creosote oil.

4568 2018-04-16 15:35:19 Our CBD-rich cannabis oil in Kush Mascara is not psychoactive. It doesn’t contain THC. 
4569 2018-04-16 15:35:19 Obviously Buckle was much more than a green activist. Fossil fuel profits specifically are direct cause of worlds biggest problems, from social to economic. A strong competitor for the destruction of mankind is pharma profit, but as #DavidBuckle knows, pharma don't roll w/o oil.
4570 2018-04-16 15:35:17 It’ll catch up on the back end. It’s the bonds and oil futures that’ll cause a proper crime scene. Shares will be raining like hail

4572 2018-04-16 15:35:03 Yes, well this is what we can expect from under-performed journalism sponsored and paid by scared competitors, unions and oil guys. Shame on them.
4573 2018-04-16 15:35:02 Have you seen the videos that havent gon viral? Heap of oil spills opened up all over their land. That media shit is a distraction
4574 2018-04-16 15:35:00 Must tell the world with a retweet. When Josh releases new content it's a true Sim feast for the eyes. Hugs for "Oil Tot"!
4575 2018-04-16 15:34:57 My understanding there is a political uprise in Venezuela. Trump Administation Concern in funding Latin Enterprises. Wouldn’t have anything to do with getting a Trump puppet in office in Venezuela to attain Venezuela oil Rights ....! Naaaa
4576 2018-04-16 15:34:55 Maintenance! I have a very busy week  planned but nothing can start until I clean/oil my machines.

4581 2018-04-16 15:34:23 Our diversification should start with taking oil and gas to the downstream for domestic use. It's one asset we have in large quantities. We shouldn't copy the Europeans and other developed world blindly. Let's harness all resources we have wisely.
4582 2018-04-16 15:34:05 @bamabroker market ignoring oil. Break 66 and it will notice. Once again, QQQ volume declining
4583 2018-04-16 15:33:57 Which is why the Green party wants the oil  from the carbon bomb to be refined here.
4584 2018-04-16 15:33:49 Russian taunts simply means higher oil, higher fuel - its going to cost more to go to the beach this summer.
4585 2018-04-16 15:33:35 Damn. How long does it take for you to grow it? When I was growing mine it took 5 months to get it that thick. Do you beard oil to maintain it?
4586 2018-04-16 15:33:26 A healthy alternative to vegetable oil for cooking is high-quality virgin coconut oil.
4587 2018-04-16 15:32:54 I think it’s far from proven exploding tar sands carbon bomb will have huge impact on GDP. Elizabeth May challenged Minister today to prove jobs by any independent study and was ignored. Many old oil jobs now automated and Texan owners for profits.
4588 2018-04-16 15:32:52 This was during War time, US Gov was strategically involved. Also, NOBODY had any commercial interest or appetite to “boil the tar sand” then. TMX was fully privately financed and ready.

4590 2018-04-16 15:32:42 @realDonaldTrump Tell Buhari to unproscribe IPOB as a terrorist group IPOB is a freedom fighter that have seen and endured too many massacres of its supporters by Buhari administration. Self determination is a right not terrorism.  Nigeria unity is only because of Niger Delta oil
4591 2018-04-16 15:32:37 I'm wondering when gas stations will start to cave in. They already make very little of their money from actual fuel, from what I understand (much more selling drinks, snacks, car washes, etc.). Oil-company-owned won't, but indie might soon.

4594 2018-04-16 15:32:19 Wrong, it’s you who must be pitied, because of your shortsightedness.  I trust you walk around naked, wherever you go, because pretty well everything in the world today is made using oil and gas in one form or another, either in manufacture or delivery.
4595 2018-04-16 15:32:15 I mean, you guys can get mad at people calling out oil money but you can't deny that City was trash before that.
4596 2018-04-16 15:32:13 They want control of the oil. Shit been repeating itself since before we been deh bout
4597 2018-04-16 15:31:56 The bottom line is weve kept you in your extra benefits for years , so id be quiet about all the freebies . You would be skint in a heartbeat ..... BTW . Its not YOUR oil ....
4598 2018-04-16 15:31:52 I think lower AB oil prices are transfers. Forgone production is in part a transfer. 

Core issue is that I think the cost-benefit comparison there is from an AB (or Canada) perspective, not global. That's it. I don't know what a global CBA would find.
4599 2018-04-16 15:31:52 Oh, it's definitely about oil! No doubt a compliant puppet is needed, while Oligarch's rape the Country of it's resource & suppression of it's people will be an advantage, in order to continue pillaging the Country. I think we can all agree, it's NOT a humanitarian cause!
4600 2018-04-16 15:31:52 Only thing on your list that actually creates jobs is the film industry. And that depends on the $.As does tourism. Do some fact checking on commercial fishing & forestry. The oil is still coming. Be it by train or pipeline. Less risk by pipeline. What kind of car do you drive?
4601 2018-04-16 15:31:46 How are you on the internet if you're against Oil?  You've got a PC/phone made purely out of renewable techs?
4602 2018-04-16 15:31:44 Pipeline jobs are temporary but oil sands jobs are not. It is more like a manufacturing operations

4604 2018-04-16 15:31:37 That's because we only know one economic principle: More Oil = More Jobs = Everything is Fine

We have no plan to learn from anybody else's mistakes, or our own.  (Born in AB & lived here all my life.)

4607 2018-04-16 15:31:20 'oil companies'? Rewriting History again? Besides, how does working on a drilling rig make you specially qualified to comment?
4608 2018-04-16 15:31:08 Example - An oil & gas E&P company completed a well-head data engineering analytics project from ingest, to transform to analytics during a 4 day POC.  They are putting that directly into production with full operational management.

4610 2018-04-16 15:30:51 IF @theresa_may is telling the truth about knowing where chemicals were kept could I ask why the fuck these places were not hit many months ago?
#corruption in search of oil no doubt.
4611 2018-04-16 15:30:51 I guess oil is like water... Eventually it will somehow find its way to an ocean...
4612 2018-04-16 15:30:45 あ？
4613 2018-04-16 15:30:43 4) how do terrorist make money? Drugs , human trafficking ,they were selling women on line, money laundering thru NGOs, FTF infiltrating civilian populations, oil . Counterfeit goods, just to name a few. You democrats have obstructed which fuels and funds terrorism and Assad .
4614 2018-04-16 15:30:42 Obvious that you're not paying attention to current production trends, Trent. It's not Notleys' fault that it's cheaper to pull oil put of the Permian than it is to scrape it out of the oil sands. 

And there's plenty happening here in the Montney. More jobs than people, bud.

4620 2018-04-16 15:30:12 And why are we increasing the public debt for this project? Because Kinder and their investors are uncertain of it's long term viability, particularly when EV car revolution kills oil market for Alberta. Let's use public $ instead. Yay!
4621 2018-04-16 15:30:11 Since when does it take an hr to get a fucking oil change 
4622 2018-04-16 15:30:05 i use about a cup of unused coffee grounds, half a cup of brown sugar, a tsp of cinnamon, and a tbsp or so of vanilla extract. add enough coconut oil to get it to hold together and then use as a body exfoliater in the shower. it's amazing, you'll have the softest skin ever

4628 2018-04-16 15:29:21 Agreed. I get why the Caps decided to go with Grubauer but as soon as they did, it went from being a pickem series to advantage Columbus. Would've started Holtby and had the kid in the wings of needed.

4630 2018-04-16 15:29:14 Why does it have to be oil? Why can't we transition into clean renewable energy?? There are jobs there too!

4634 2018-04-16 15:28:25 I made the switch last year. In the terms of gas milage. I can't really tell the difference. But I AM able to go longer between oil changes since synthetic oil retains more if its lifespan under normal driving than conventional oil does
4635 2018-04-16 15:28:12 I love the benefits of having a new #used vehicle off the lot with warranty. Free oil changes, car inspections and tire rotations. Also getting a chip on my windshield fixed for #free

4641 2018-04-16 15:27:36 The Kinder Morgan pipeline *already* didn't make economic sense.

The tidewater price differential was/is illusory. The forecast market was already shrinking. And cheaper, cleaner oil was already known to be plentiful, and available both cheaper and cleaner elsewhere.
4642 2018-04-16 15:27:26 Apparently oil is not something you should drink or ingest. 

  You learn something new every day.
4643 2018-04-16 15:27:13 @qlee50 If you cannot support your argument and resort to name calling (then blocking me so maybe I wouldn’t know you called me an ignorant child?) it’s a sign that you argument isn’t that strong. Orphaned Oil wells are a problem but are very different from the oil sands.
4644 2018-04-16 15:27:11 Sure, a puppet. I guess if you ignore what Western empires have to gain by turning Syria into another power vacuum. Not just oil, global pressure to all counties in solidarity.

4648 2018-04-16 15:26:47 This is why it was encouraging to read last week that @IcelandFoods are no longer using palm oil in their own foods.

4652 2018-04-16 15:26:13 @talkSPORTDrive typical of a bitter united fan. Oil money yada yada could play the Citeh bingo with him. City have done more for Manchester than Utd have ever done. City's duty is not to English football but to ourselves the fans
4653 2018-04-16 15:26:04 War demands fuel, so the oil would still funnel into more military recruits, weapons, and tanks.
4654 2018-04-16 15:26:01 Haha so achcha hai .. they put oil well in doubted countries .. threat currencies in doubtful currency .. its all@b cause iran agreed to use Ruppee for trade with India .. and other gulf countries too thinking that .. if it happens then it will be big trouble for Dollar ..

4659 2018-04-16 15:25:41 It is quite bizarre how it is (D)s always pushing policy that is beneficial to Russia like their anti-fracking stance for example. Useful idiots indeed! Cheap oil is how we punish Russia and watch (D)s howl and the economy booms even further if it happens.
4660 2018-04-16 15:25:41 “You smell like Tuscan Sun Spa and Moroccan oil” sounds about right

4662 2018-04-16 15:25:37 I'm confused. Saudi Arabia, the worlds' leading exporter of fossil fuels, wants to develop a solar power plant in order to wean itself from fossil fuel use. AND YET the US condemns solar and wind power development? Odd, that. Almost like the oil companies are writing legislation.
4663 2018-04-16 15:25:29 Regardless of whether the rapture is during our lives or not, Jesus only knows those who keep their lamps full of oil.

4674 2018-04-16 15:23:59 I’ve never been asked that question.

What’s the answer if I ever get asked why I should use olive oil instead of butter?

This is a strange way to run a search engine, but I’ll go with it, you just keep on tweeting the answers Ducky.

4685 2018-04-16 15:22:16 The squabble on who should be permitted to exploit oil in Ogoni, and by-so-doing, exploit the poor people of Ogoni in the long run, has thickened. The chiefs and traditional rulers have not been left out of this vaudeville.
4686 2018-04-16 15:22:02 Easy, Tillerson still in, sanctions lifted and massive Russian oil deal fully implemented.

4691 2018-04-16 15:21:40 Kinder Morgan idea:  
Feds incent the alternative energy industry to balance against the investment in oil. Short term pain with long term gain and a strategy that could make BC a centre of excellence for clean energy. Everyone wins.
4692 2018-04-16 15:21:40 I'll be the first to admit that I recenty thought you had gone off the reservation with this line of conspiracy theory, but then I took a look at the amount of oil Syria has, & I think you're perspective now makes more sense. Cheers for your thoughtful analysis.

4695 2018-04-16 15:21:30 There will always be some addiction oil, electricity, coal etc unless manufacturing of cars is limited like Singapore or cars run on solar power.

4710 2018-04-16 15:19:42 Better question, what does "in the national interest" mean? Oil? Minerals? Influence? 

Typical political language to not get to the root of any issue and just say "it's in our interests".

4714 2018-04-16 15:19:20 US tankers travel in US waters. Canadian tankers travel in Canadian waters. Oil from Washington comes to BC by pipeline or truck or train.
4715 2018-04-16 15:19:14 That's certainly a last resort. Feds cud withhold funding from BC for infrastructure etc. Job one should be keeping protesters away from the job site. RCMP are there now and doesn't seem to be working. Alta moving this week to cut oil supplies. Lots of options - lack of guts.

There is ALREADY a pipeline that goes to BC, built by Kinder Morgan. The product ISN'T landlocked, the argument is over an EXPANSION OF THE CURRENT LINE.

And how is leaving Canada going to help? The US currently rapes us for our oil NOW.

4743 2018-04-16 15:15:56 You don’t want my oil because you don’t want the agonizing pressing process it takes to produce it.
4744 2018-04-16 15:15:53 That was not the oil that killed 47 people in a town where the oil was transported by rail; it was to you the good oil.  But to you it is ok to kill people by blown trains and pipelines have never blown up a town.  Oil sands takes the oil out of the sand which you call tar.

4757 2018-04-16 15:14:37 That's a deeply-ingrained thing though - the core belief that authority flows from individual leaders, instead of collective mandate and delegation. That's like the oil/water split in our politics.

4775 2018-04-16 15:12:58 We likely have 30 more years of oil use. Trudeau massively attacked when he spoke of the eventual phasing out of fossil fuels. Remember, most of the exported oil will replace coal.

4780 2018-04-16 15:12:22 Both types of engine oil are made from crude oil that comes from the ground. The difference is that synthetic motor oils are made from more advanced refining processes and are of a higher purity and quality than conventional mineral oils or semi-synthetic oils.

4814 2018-04-16 15:09:00 I also love how people still claim the pipeline will benefit BC somehow when all the bitumen is being shipped overseas. We’re being used as a trampoline. Oil bounces overseas while the money bounces back to Alberta. There’s no benefit to BC.

4836 2018-04-16 15:06:22 Cut the shit about bias, as if that's some sort of slur. Energi News has editorially supported the oil sands and more pipelines for the past 4 yrs, and we do it based on our reporting of the facts, science and evidence. We also support the energy transition and clean energy tech

4852 2018-04-16 15:05:26 That's insane. Canada blindly following US marching orders is what's gotten us into mideast conflicts that have nothing to do with us, or with the protection of civilians. These are US wars for empire and oil. Shameful we're following the USA blindly.

4859 2018-04-16 15:05:13 Rouble went down with Russian/FSU economy. FSU's significant oil consumption drops - as fuel prices increase with falling RUB and reduced consumption during recession. Drilling did decrease, but they had more to export. The rouble deval did help companies survive hold production.
4860 2018-04-16 15:05:12 They all did in the sense of not adding to the Heritage Trust fund ignoring the Mandate to add a percentage of oil Royalties.

4866 2018-04-16 15:04:18 @CityPowerJhb this is beyond pathetic now!!! Florida still with no power!!! How are we suppose to work and earn incomes?? What is the excuse now more oil leaks???
4867 2018-04-16 15:04:15 Remember when they said we would sell oil from the seized Iraqi oil fields to pay for the endless war? HAH! Who the fuck is making the coin off that oil and where is our cut? Asking for everybody.

4873 2018-04-16 15:03:45 “The emissions increase from the oil sector allowed within the Alberta climate plan will more than offset the reductions by 2030 from a $50 national carbon price”
4874 2018-04-16 15:03:21 Syria is, in fact, about oil.
4875 2018-04-16 15:03:12 You started dropping the value of our dollar so you could sell coal and oil on the world market. It's dropped four times in the last 12 months. Or didn't you think we were paying attention?

4877 2018-04-16 15:02:47 Soooo disappointed in him. He’s sweet talking the oil industry to try to get the prairies to vote for him next election not seeing he could lose the many more constituents who voted for him that are against the pipelines & want renewal energy. 

I’d vote for a FN PM!
4878 2018-04-16 15:02:33 I agree that they should have spent the money to diversify the wealth. I noticed that a majority of the Alberta Investment is in oil and gas industry, which is dead wrong. But it is due to their mismanagement and I don't call it corruption unless you have evidence.

4880 2018-04-16 15:02:30 Trudeau says he will make assurances that B.C. will not experience an oil spill. No human can guarantee that.. One just happened near Campbell River.  Federal bulldozer deal over and above majority of B.C. with CC and she is no longer in office.

4884 2018-04-16 15:01:43 selling a product that appeals to manly instincts means using sex. Imagine the 100’s of millions of cans of motor oil and tires sitting in warehouses if it weren’t for scantly clad beauties.
4885 2018-04-16 15:01:33 El Peak oil no es a nivel regional. Es a nivel mundial y hay que descontar los barriles gastados en la producción. No es lo mismo explotar un pozo con TRE 50 que 5.

4908 2018-04-16 14:59:30 This is what happens when Canadians allow foreign-funded enviro activists to shut down our resource sector. No LNG, no pipelines, cap on oil sands, all western resources vilified and demonized using lies and smear tactics.

4927 2018-04-16 14:57:38 Nor is sending them out. First priority should be cutting out oil money,again which is impossible.
4928 2018-04-16 14:57:25 I used to keep getting cuts, because I'm a hasty shaver of legs, but I've swapped soap for hair conditioner (can also use oil but it ruins the razor) and it means less cuts!! hasty + not scarred now.
4929 2018-04-16 14:57:19 And how many of those were bused in by foreign eco-warriors bent on the destruction of Canada’s oil industry because of our weak/absent leadership. 

Sorry but the .0000004% of the population that doesn’t want the pipeline don’t get to dictate what the rest of the country needs.
4930 2018-04-16 14:57:17 Peak Oil es técnicamente pico de producción. Otra cosa es cómo midamos ese pico de producción de petróleo.

4932 2018-04-16 14:56:59 It is relevant that Syria owns its central bank, dropped the US$, has oil and gas reserves, banned GMO seeds, and has no IMF debt - no wonder they are after them - pipeline war at its best. #SyriaStrikes

4964 2018-04-16 14:52:59 War, huh, what is it good for?

4967 2018-04-16 14:52:35 Kinda hard to do when the PM is pushing for the pipeline to go ahead instead of transitioning to renewal energy inovantions which will employ more than oil currently does.

4977 2018-04-16 14:51:35 It also suggests Government is getting back in the business of business.  Perhaps some new Crown Corporations on the horizon? Just what we need is a tax-sucking anti-competitive, sector demolishing Canada Pipeline Corporation to ensure oil export capacity lags despite pipe space
4978 2018-04-16 14:51:33 I call them paid mercenaries or foreign actors in light of the Action Hive Proposal. Tides, New Ventures, Oak - all financed by US entities dedicated to opposing oil sands and pipeline development. This is no different than Russian interference in democracy. #followthemoney
4979 2018-04-16 14:51:24 The perfect cake frosting for your kitchen has four main ingredients. You need eggs, sugar, butter or cooking oil…
4980 2018-04-16 14:51:19 That refiner would need an upgrade to refine oil sands crude bitumen.

4983 2018-04-16 14:51:11 I torture myself with this poop smelling(actually garlic smelling) hair oil in vain hope that one day my hair will be better.
4984 2018-04-16 14:51:07 So for you Future is a club dumping a lot of arab oil money and buying good players and winning the league( Just like buying it) or a foundation that earns the money to buy the players, invest in youth development and providing opportunities.
4985 2018-04-16 14:51:03 What you need, avocado pear & carrots, grate the carrots with a hand grater or use a blender to get medium sized chunks.
Add the grated carrots and avocado into your carrier oil.. it can be coconut oil, almond oil, or olive oil @TheYettss @Buff_Desastre @Symbieeee

4989 2018-04-16 14:50:37 Excerpted from G&M piece "TransCanada's decision last year to shelve its Energy East pipeline, a $15.7-billion proposal to repurpose underused mainline capacity to transport more than one million barrels of crude oil a day from Alberta to eastern ports. TC.. studying options."...

4991 2018-04-16 14:50:18 I stopped using any products that I can’t pronounce the ingredients (aka no chemicals) everything is water based and not oil. Also- I’ve started to using baking soda with water as an exfoliator. MIRACLES. My skin has been firmer and the uneven tones are starting to go away
4992 2018-04-16 14:50:12 サク売ってないんでしょ？
4993 2018-04-16 14:50:08 The IEA kept its oil demand forecast at 1.5 million barrels per day (mb/d), although it noted that the back-and-forth on trade tariffs between the U.S. and China puts the demand outlook at risk
4994 2018-04-16 14:50:07 Americans have been sleeping in peace since 1946 (in the case of world conflict, internal?..nah).US hasn’t been involved in a war for freedom since WWII, and it wasn’t even specifically for the US (we just wanted control, facts). Every war fought since was for power/oil

5000 2018-04-16 14:49:34 Please, spare us the excuses.

Recession did not kick in till the productive sector tanked, something that wasn't caused by the price of oil but by Buhari's policies (or the lack thereof).

Blaming the past is something Buhari has always been good at sha!!
5001 2018-04-16 14:49:29 no it's time for this corrupt lobbyist for big oil who couldn't care less about protecting the environment from hazardous .......that companies were supposed to be preventing because it cut into profits for them to resign.  his very appointment is orwellian.

sometimes bio oil if I’m going through a dry patch
5004 2018-04-16 14:48:43 Yes, it’s hexane free. A heat process called fractionation is used to produce MCT from palm and/or coconut oil. This method uses the different melting points of fats to separate them.
5005 2018-04-16 14:48:33 Nigeria foreign reserve hits $47.3b almost doubling the amount the PDP left after 16yrs of oil boom
5006 2018-04-16 14:48:32 Yeah we don't usually cut the head off the fish then immediately throw it in the oil. I knew snakes
5007 2018-04-16 14:48:22 Since it has operated, KM has reportedly been responsible for 78 spills along the pipeline route. Which is a not bad record for the oil industry. 

Do your research before you spout pal.

5010 2018-04-16 14:48:01 Scheer behaves more and more like Trump as time goes on. These comments of his are absolutely untrue. Oil companies (and others) have always been on the receiving end of government coffers, whether with tax credits or other means - and it's the taxpayer who pays!
5011 2018-04-16 14:47:58 Integrity?  Trump?  Bahaha!  Did you get a “degree” at Trump University or something?  He’s a snake oil salesman and you got swindled!

5015 2018-04-16 14:47:52 One person can’t change an entire economy on their own and while there are people like you who can’t see that a renewable economy provides 8 times the jobs and is better for the planet, the transition away from oil will take so long, the planet will be dead.
5016 2018-04-16 14:47:52 Cheapest place to have your oil changed?
5017 2018-04-16 14:47:37 Look at what is in it. Corn oil and thats about it. Not all snacks have lack of real food.

5025 2018-04-16 14:46:23 What grew the reserves? Is it the increase crude oil prices or meaningful reforms. #Talkingpoint
5026 2018-04-16 14:46:19 I don't think it's good for Canada to become more reliant on the US and it concerns me that if KM is killed, likely carbon pricing is killed along with it in AB and possibly Canada. Also rail is less safe & increasingly used for oil. I support KM
5027 2018-04-16 14:46:12 I start to wonder if they are two sides of the coin. The west has a fetish for war and seems as soon as Trump settled in the White House and met his advisors... BAM! Pro-war.

I don't know if it's oil, lack of a central bank or a western unfriendly dictator but something drags us

BCs economy depends on fuels from oil as much as anyone else, your own Premier asked Ottawa to intervene in high gasoline prices. One day the renewable tech will be there but you need to pay for it first
5035 2018-04-16 14:45:30 Ok. Well we had a minority leader for 6yrs, a minority minister for oil, what did both do for Otuoke? 

What have all the Northern HOS done for the North? 

We’ve all been dealt a bad hand by the political elites.

5042 2018-04-16 14:44:47 Obama handled the BP Oil Spill, Dakota Pipeline & the crisis in Flint horribly. 

A scandal is an action or event regarded as morally or legally wrong and causing general public outrage.

Those mistakes weren’t made because of lack of morals or done illegally. There was inaction.

5060 2018-04-16 14:42:57 And because we like being under threat so much, we throw oil into the fires of the ME whenever we can ? Would these be there without the iraq war ? And how does or latest bombing campaign relate to that ?
5061 2018-04-16 14:42:54 They discovered oil and natural gas in Syria and now everybody wants it and the  big guys take it away from little guys as always look at Iraq
5062 2018-04-16 14:42:31 Yes I urge you to look at who consists of their Strategic Board of Directors.... also that it has been given exclusive rights to extract oil from the Golan Heights by none other than Netanyahu if my memory serves me correctly #syria #endthewar
5063 2018-04-16 14:41:57 So I go to work and my boss goes you know how to work on cars right go do the oil change on the van here’s a full days work go handle that for me take the day off SAY FUCKING LESS MY GUY

5072 2018-04-16 14:41:05 How to get rid of these oil damn it
5073 2018-04-16 14:40:59 Oh no, I get that.

But, like I've said, the US is not the only one who has dicked around in the region. GB would certainly have not let it go and it seems amazingly unlikely that everyone else would just leave an oil rich democracy alone.
5074 2018-04-16 14:40:59 What I don’t understand is the use of natural beauty (little flower, snowflake etc) to insult people. Why not use ugly things to insult, like oil spill or plastic waste or nuclear contaminant, toxic rot.....
5075 2018-04-16 14:40:31 He wasn't responsible for NOI borrowing to pay salaries in 1st & 2nd quarters of 2015.

5084 2018-04-16 14:39:53 The #NDP  are going to introduce a bill to allow them to turn the oil tap off.  They aren't  actually going to turn the tap off because the "all talk and no action"  strategy has been wildly successful so far.  #ableg
5085 2018-04-16 14:39:52 Technically, not intervening is an intentional devaluation given that the market drastically lowered it. They did have billions left to spend, but they chose to save that money for strategic investments etc. With oil above $53, they're adding into reserves again.
5086 2018-04-16 14:39:42 Oil painting is so cool  I want to learn how but

5089 2018-04-16 14:39:14 Canada lost 52,000 direct oil/gas jobs after 2014, probably 2-3x that in indirect jobs, most of them in Alberta. Only 17,000 are coming back by 2021, according to PetroLMI. One reason why Notley is spending $1 billion to support petchem, partial upgrading expansion.

5093 2018-04-16 14:38:39 One has oil the other doesn't that's why those figures differ....if you feel the minorities in Nigeria don't have it relatively different to the majority...keyword being relatively then there's nothing more I can add
5094 2018-04-16 14:38:31 TMX doesn't send fuel (a very small amount to be specific). sends dilluted bitumen to be shipped off to China. Most of it is so low grade it won't even be turned into bunker fuel. Even if TMX is built we still must import that oil and fuel as TMX doesn't help with that regard.
5095 2018-04-16 14:38:22 if you could have the oil money you would take it in a heat beat
5096 2018-04-16 14:38:05 Why must we fund the war in Syria through higher oil prices? Can they source crude oil somewhere else? Every fuel price hike equates to less food to fill our stomachs, but politicians could not care less.
5097 2018-04-16 14:37:58 Agreed.

I would love an oil free world...but at this point, we dont' have the tech to get off of it completely.

One way to advance the technology is to have a strong economy, so progressive governments should be able to allow oil extraction and use the revenue for clean R & D.
5098 2018-04-16 14:37:47 I’m sorry but I have seen no proof that this chemical attack happened and I see no reason why the Syrian government would suddenly attack it’s people it does not make sense to me hundreds of groups have different interests in Syria but it all leads down to oil we all know that

5110 2018-04-16 14:36:58 The United States is nothing more than Israel’s Cash cow, for 75 years we have been in bed with the Saudi Arabians who are known as war criminals we give them our money weaponry that they sell to terrorists. The entire destruction of the Middle East has been about oil & gas!

5114 2018-04-16 14:36:20 Pastor oil ha ha ha ha!
5115 2018-04-16 14:36:17 Nothing new here.  We have been giving our tax $$ to foreign oil comapnies for years.  Can’t find money for the needy at home, but no worries subsidizing foreign investors
5116 2018-04-16 14:35:56 Indian  Rupee ended sharply weaker today. Selling pressure  from both public as well as private banks put the Rupee under pressure.    Further, Dollar demand from oil importers also weighed on the domestic     currency. Rupee ended at 65.49 vs. Friday’s close of 65.20.
5117 2018-04-16 14:35:53 I've been tempted to try mineral oil
5118 2018-04-16 14:35:53 Apply something over there (cream, oil etc) which will stop you second or third time.
5119 2018-04-16 14:35:36 CBC, including @CBCNews, @CBCPolitics, @PnPCBC, is resolutely pro-pipeline, pro-Kinder Morgan, pro-oil sands. Climate change to them all is nothing much to be concerned about. CBC is a pipe line, oil sands talking points delivery service. Climate change denial by other means.

5125 2018-04-16 14:34:41 Who defines 'British interests'? It is clear that the arms & oil industries have benefitted historically from our interventions in the Middle East. Are we assuming this is the extent of the national interest? Who will pay to replace all weapons being used? Ordinary citizens, no?
5126 2018-04-16 14:34:31 As a venezuelan, I can assure you this is a worthless coin. There is so much info that doesn’t get out to the world since they control the media you couldn’t even imagine how poorly administrated is the oil industry and how the destroyed it This is just their attempt to get money
5127 2018-04-16 14:34:30 Different products Roy. The Bahrain field is a tight light oil product versus the heavier grade of crude that is shipped by the current and proposed Trans Mountain lines. Bahrain is expected to be a largely gas play, would compete more directly with the Permian from the US.
5128 2018-04-16 14:34:27 Maybe you should start with stopping 400,000 barrels of crude oil that are transported off the B.C. coast every single by diesel-burning barges to Vancouver Island. Over 197,000 vessels arrived or departed from west coast ports, 1,487 of them were tankers.
5129 2018-04-16 14:34:20 Value of rand doesn't impact black people? Wrong! Oil price increase in rands, fuel price increase, cost of everything delivered by road increases. Taxi fare increases. 

Stop thinking the poor are sheltered from a poor economy! They are impacted most!
5130 2018-04-16 14:34:00 Ouch!  In the long run . . . you're gonna have to deep six that oil heat. I'd look into geothermal heat pump, probably the only long term scalable heat solution other than maybe biogas or syngas through existing pipelines. Oil heat is obsolete!

5138 2018-04-16 14:32:40 But theres no pipeline right now and our economy is fine. Why would not building it ruin the economy? You realise British Columbians have to pay tax on oil flowing through province which hurts the average British Columbian and puts debt on BC.
5139 2018-04-16 14:32:35 If the government really wanted to help the people: 
- it would sell PTR in VEF
- it would really back it in oil
- it would really make it decentralized

Instead, only those connected to the governing clique will have access. We've seen this over and over again.
5140 2018-04-16 14:32:35 Oh, cool.  So I guess we're even then with my entire family being here, a good chunk in oil and gas, etc, etc.  

Some places are hurting more than others, but welcome to boom/bust.

But keep on mistrusting anything that doesn't adhere to the narrative you're trying to spin.

5149 2018-04-16 14:31:51 You are only working hard to destroy Canadian economy, and want us 100% dependent on Saudi oil. You are working so hard to get a seat on the U.N. with your pals from the Middle East

5152 2018-04-16 14:31:38 The US has benefitted greatly from the USD being the global reserve currency and from being the currency used to price things like oil. I wonder how long China will put up with that... Trump lacks understanding of economics, to all our detriment.

5155 2018-04-16 14:31:33 With USA stepping up our own oil production, and pending plans, it would seem to be a wise move of the market to invest in High Efficiency Technology in regards to Crude Oil, Bio-Fuel, and Agricultural Tech in the Anglo-Dutch Region.

That is the issue, it is low grade bitumen that...
1. We don’t know how it mixes with water if something happens 
2. No guarantee of getting it to market with a profitable price

Try not to pretend this bad quality product is the same as high end oil

5239 2018-04-16 14:23:03 I wont miss apologizing to my son for the country he & his generation will inherit & have to fix, I want to see pics of nat’l parks w/o wondering how much will be sold off for oil & mineral rights, I won’t miss calling the Hill daily to demand impeachment.
5240 2018-04-16 14:22:56 Hoping I win this time considering this will be my 1st time trying out CBD OIL 
5241 2018-04-16 14:22:53 You a mf lie, anyways softiago can't handle his oil on the rig and he loves blowing chunks mid sesh. Kudos for throwing up in your shirt tho that was uber polite
5242 2018-04-16 14:22:47 This bombing will not save any kids. It will only: 

1) Help the creation of an oil pipeline;

2) Help Trump’s re-election. 

Seeing how #TheResistance is finding common ground with Trump on this is revealing. Dems' only argument in 2020 will be “but we're *better* warhawks.”
5243 2018-04-16 14:22:46 Absolutely not.  We cannot meet our climate commitments unless that oil stays in the ground.  It is dirty and unwanted.  Significant indigenous opposition exists and was not truly consulted.  We have no way of cleaning up a dilbit spill that, statistically, will happen.  #StopKM
5244 2018-04-16 14:22:42 Ima start putting lavender oil on everything. It makes me feel rejuvenated and loved <3
5245 2018-04-16 14:22:42 I'm try to eat clean but my money and my life as a student won't allow me to do so. Even olive oil is very pricey.

Talk to Montana, Idaho & Washington for tidewater access. It's time for Alberta to leave the toxic relationship.

5252 2018-04-16 14:22:22 The hypocritical statements from the Quebec premier has to be addressed as well. How about we lobby to shut down oil shipments into the port of MONTREAL or Quebec City until those countries comply with our environmental, safety and labour standards?

I question why the lobbyists target Canadian oil which is a drop in the bucket, and not foreign oil coming into Canada. It’s suspicious

5288 2018-04-16 14:18:55 What happened in Rwanda was tragic, and nations should not exploit the lives of 800,000 innocent Tutsis to justify toppling governments in order to steal their oil (Iraq, Libya), or build pipelines (Qatar gas line to Europe through Syria). Exploiting innocent lives is immoral.

5307 2018-04-16 14:16:03 If you are wondering why I spend a bit more time this year with gold and crude oil, it's because they are in a bull market. Equities are not.
5308 2018-04-16 14:15:52 He is trying to Nationalize the oil industry through the back door. Given he has implemented all of Pierre’s old Marxist policies this shouldn’t be a surprise.
5309 2018-04-16 14:15:51 Here's a tip!

Try saturating the tape with a household oil like baby oil or olive oil for about 5 minutes before removing, this helps to break down the adhesive.

5331 2018-04-16 14:14:16 So basically we locked into one market thanks to foreign funded groups highly effective campaign against AB oil. The incredible lack of coverage of this in political and media circles up this point is appalling. How was this not a major story 6 yrs ago?
5332 2018-04-16 14:14:15 Sorry....it’s vegan if you sub oil (something neutral) for butter, which we do.
5333 2018-04-16 14:14:06 Shell is cutting back on its exploration efforts in South Africa’s eastern, western and northern Cape Karoo citing low oil prices, legislation and regulatory frameworks among its reasons.

5344 2018-04-16 14:12:21 Follow the money. Follow the oil pipeline. Ask who gains the most. Then ask if those industries sponsor the Tories, the GOP and Macron's party. They do. The bombing of Syria has nothing to do with Syrian people. They are as irrelevant to right-wing parties as you and I.
5345 2018-04-16 14:12:17 Alberta provided 9.3 billion dollars to Quebec alone last year in equalization payments. They provide billions in equalization payments but you’re not wrong that we need to get away from oil

i'd be surprised if ONE is.
thats why saoudi arabia is foraging out at sea,and softening up their society.
why i suppose, there s an immigration problem in #europe right now:they sold europe for more oil in the 90s
5350 2018-04-16 14:12:03 I just wish everyone would stop needing oil. Send them out of business.. I dream of this day!
5351 2018-04-16 14:12:03 “The two chief threats to Russia’s modernization program are budgetary constraints, largely caused by the the steep fall in oil prices and Western sanctions following its war with Ukraine.” - Michael Kofman
5352 2018-04-16 14:12:01 Well, this guy has a clue. Americans, in general, do want to get out of the Mid East. We know it’s abt oil. What we need is a change in the propaganda that climate change is a hoax & massive investment in renewables. Plus, we need to end the devisive rhetoric on both sides.
5353 2018-04-16 14:11:59 @PettyMurphy08 congrats on the website! Finna order some more miracle oil today. You see my inches

5355 2018-04-16 14:11:50 And what are the reasons for us not condemning atrocities carried out by Israel? Saudi Arabia? 

'Allies' doesn't cut it for me. Oil / Money is the most likely reason.
5356 2018-04-16 14:11:42 I have no idea how to make them. I'll play with ThinkOrSwim when I get home. Don't want to reveal anything here, but we are near what we are waiting for. Options expiration may delay it, but we know we are near :)

5361 2018-04-16 14:11:16 Why didn’t the Federal Conservatives advise Albertans 10 years ago that #Alberta Oil was landlocked and deal with it then. Kline mentioned it just before he was kicked out. #yyc #yeg
5362 2018-04-16 14:10:49 Now shes clairvoyant... bah.
With all of the U.S.A's attributes minerals, oil etc. Its labor force and technology we should be the garden that God wanted us to have... man has taken it away! #Vote out the servants in gov. that have 10's of millions but don't want u to have crumbs

2. I agree less likely

5365 2018-04-16 14:10:29 I don't believe AB provides much $$ since the oil crash.  We need to get off oil.

Honestly, let them leave.  I'm ok with BC leaving too.  Confederation for us is central Canada running everything.
5366 2018-04-16 14:10:26 This doesn't mean we're broken as a country. It does mean the good times are over possibly for  the long term and that we need to find jobs outside of the oil industry. Which is possible if our kids go into non-oil fields with big incomes. Canada is a great place. It is not broke
5367 2018-04-16 14:10:22 I don’t really get pimples so when I feel one coming I do the most I put pure tea tree oil on it & woke up with a whole burn on my chin and now it’s peeling

5372 2018-04-16 14:09:52 Where is this magic place that grows animal feed causing less destruction than palm oil production? & how many animals will die for the lard and butter (including male calves)? & how much land is taken up to grow sunflower and rapeseed oil? You really haven't though this through.
5373 2018-04-16 14:09:41 Or they can just stay the fuck at home and get themselves another job than stealing other peoples oil...

5375 2018-04-16 14:09:22 They were paid by Mid East OPECs for years to scream peak oil to keep the price of oil up. Decide for yourself weather you think that was a lie with the benefit of hindsight.
5376 2018-04-16 14:09:11 America is to busy extracting oil from regions, annexed by Israel, in southern Syria.

5378 2018-04-16 14:09:08 Restricting the flow of oil to BC will be a direct economic loss to Alberta. Not to BC. You are already having trouble getting rid of capacity and now that will only increase. #economics @RachelNotley #Bcpoli #abpoli #pipelinedebate

5388 2018-04-16 14:08:21 At least get your facts straight. Alberta Carbon Competitiveness Incentives are carbon levy + OBAs + $440 million innovation that is already helping producers drive down heavy crude oil carbon-intensity. In 10 years, it will be at or below average American crude oil. Not dirty.

5391 2018-04-16 14:08:05 No, the objective is to bloody Iran's nose and show her its proper place in the food chain. Saudis are just sitting back and relaxing - watching the show totally smug. There won't be WW3,Russia's happy as well coz Iran messes up her (Russia) oil export and has to be reigned in.

Canada is clean and y'all keep it that way. I trust that to only get better. Other oil countries come here to learn from Canada's best practices!

5456 2018-04-16 14:01:54 Honest question (maybe for @trevortombe or @bcshaffer?): aside from "it's the benchmark," why are discussions of Western Canadian Select price differentials always compared to WTI, rather than to a more similar heavy/sour oil?

5463 2018-04-16 14:01:20 It does beg the question why they bombed.. When no one confirmed chemical weapons. Reasons : 1. The UK /USA are the source 2. They planted evidence (less likely?). 3. The more the bomb, the more they can offer a clean up followed by payback via taking oil.
5464 2018-04-16 14:01:17 UN declares Golan heights an occupied territory.

5465 2018-04-16 14:01:13 Yeah of course they were are you stupid there is NO oil production from Syria that's why OPEC have / had increased barrelage  over last 3yrs to compensate the loss of Syrian oilfields. If you want to reply do your homework 1st I will entertain it then

5475 2018-04-16 14:00:22 Assad gave up his chemical weapons when Kerry was Secretary of State, it’s just an excuse we used to get more involved in Syria. I’m assuming because of oil primarily

5515 2018-04-16 13:55:09 Anything their oil nation funders tell them to say, remember peak oil? Hoax paid for by oil nations to increase price of oil.
5516 2018-04-16 13:55:07 Oil prices dropped and government bonds weakened on Monday, after the US and Russia avoided any direct military engagement during an American-led strike in Syria. Oil prices started the week in negative territory, amid thoughts that weekend missile strikes may be a one-off event.

5550 2018-04-16 13:52:23 Certain kinds of oil - ie, conventional.  Oil sands stuff isn't.

The kind of oil coming out of the ground in Iran is conventional - as well, most of the USA is currently oil independent given new pumping tech, etc, that takes advantage of shallow/conventional/etc
5551 2018-04-16 13:52:12 Slightly different dynamics though. India mainly lost ground in oil and gems.
5552 2018-04-16 13:52:08 "Fossil" fuel. Bahahahahahahahah. How much oil do you suppose you would get from a 2 ton dinosaur 3 gallons? 10 gallons? Then do the math.

5555 2018-04-16 13:51:21 Jonny, you’re so uninformed. Alberta sells their oil at $80.00 equivalent. That’s plenty of cash to make a profit. Plenty, even with the differential. There is no “dire” outlook. Oil production world wide is ramping up, due to demand.  needs tide water to compete with 
5556 2018-04-16 13:51:21 hahaha...No @charlesadler the fact that most things are made of oil doesn't make them hypocrites, it makes them hostages, if your argument in favor of oil is so great, you should be able to make do better than mere backhanded ad hominem. #truth

But a steady deteriation shown on the stock market, oil prices will rise,until peeps can't afford gas... Making a glut on market. Then a shortage
5562 2018-04-16 13:50:41 don’t think Syria gassed its own, more likely either rebels want 2 extend USA presence, bcos they were about 2 pull out, or Russia did 4 same reason, except 2 keep Syria dependent on them & keep their own influence on Assad & increase their stake on the huge amount of oil there.

5565 2018-04-16 13:50:06 Have you tried CBD oil for your pain?
5566 2018-04-16 13:50:06 It seems a flawed economic policy to try and increase oil production & exports while prices are down. Oil is a finite resource. Why not hold on to it to reap full value? Or is that too long term a policy for the election cycle? #ableg #KinderMorgan
5567 2018-04-16 13:50:02 How are three anti oil gov'ts going to negotiate a settlement to save a pipeline that in reality none support. This is a farce
5568 2018-04-16 13:49:58 Sure the idea is innovative, not sure if anyone else did it or thought of it before. However, the price isn't actually fluctuating with the price of oil. It's a scam coin and it does more damage to crypto than good imo.

Can earnings season meet the raise bar? perhaps, but a lot baked into expectations going forward. Added to Oil short at 66.83
5572 2018-04-16 13:49:43 Mr Trudeau is planning to invest 2 billion Canadian dollars in an Amerucan oil pipeline.  I would much rather see that money invested in helping people by building clean water pipelines to ensure everyone in this country has access to clean water. #CDNpoli

China is a country rich in crude oil.
5582 2018-04-16 13:48:14 It's a part of the GCR (global currency reset) that's taking place as we speak.
This takes place every few years. It's common.
The world is replacing Cabal fiat money with hard mineral, gems, oil etc. reserves (gold).
We are now Gold Backed once again. Money now has value

5589 2018-04-16 13:47:19 That's funny because it was predicted over a month ago that the USA and UK were going to use a nerve gas attack to blame Russia and Assad.. they desperately want the oil in Golan Heights. Removal of Assad would give them that. This isn't about anything but that oil. Research it

5592 2018-04-16 13:47:12 So is the #ParisAgreement. If you care for Canadians you must put our future first. Make renewable resources legacy not oil.

5612 2018-04-16 13:45:21 Venezuela is reliant on the price of fossil fuels, as it’s their main export and a large component of their entire economy. Simply put, their undiversified economy crashed when oil crashed.

5648 2018-04-16 13:40:32 The Shenzhen Stock Exchange opened a new Chinese oil trading market (March 26th) to compete with the west and it allows trading with gold. Some are calling this the end of the Petrodollar
5649 2018-04-16 13:40:31 You forgot: to continue to promote and sell the weapons of  war and control oil production.

5659 2018-04-16 13:39:04 And, please, stop the nonsense about "the east", etc. Many of the workers (and families) in Ft. Mac come from "the east", and have a very direct interest in the oil patch and AB's prosperity. As do the rest of the country.
5660 2018-04-16 13:38:54 @meisenstadt58 I am watching you in C-Span. You just literally said that US wanted Iraqi OIL, forthcoming I should say, given that we were told it was about WMD.
5661 2018-04-16 13:38:44 I didn’t say anything about where the km oil expansion is going. You’re clearly insane. I don’t want to have to block you but I will if you keep this up.

5669 2018-04-16 13:38:23 Lybia: The military dictator Gaddafi. He had the audacity to take control of the oil from the monarchy and give it to the people. He declared homelessness an abomination (on the government). He must go. Now, Lybia openly trade slaves.

5675 2018-04-16 13:37:45 So you prefer that Canadian money for oil goes to Saudi Arabia?

Where much of the money then ends up in the hands of terrorists.

Just another blind sheep who believes in Trudeau's propaganda.
5676 2018-04-16 13:37:42 Syria is being called a rogue state on MSM... let me number the reasons that define a "rogue state":

Syria has a state own central bank
Syria completely banned gmo´s
Syria turned away from the petrodollar
Syria never acccepted an IMF "loan"
Syria has big oil and gas reserves

5701 2018-04-16 13:34:56 @oweidimieari #NCDMB is about the Oil and Gas Sector. So everytime @wabote_simbi says "this sector" he means the Oil and Gas sector, unless otherwise stated.
5702 2018-04-16 13:34:46 As we Skype with our friends in Tokyo while sitting in NY, the #PetrolNazis are still pushing gas and oil through tubes and drilling into our Mother Earth to deplete her of any future resources. Do you see the lunacy yet? #ItsAllOnePipeline. #NoWarInSyria #GenieEnergy

5710 2018-04-16 13:34:11 Oh! I get it. You're just scared to get oil on your fingers around Americans. That's a logical fear actually
5711 2018-04-16 13:34:07 There's 2 competing oil & gas supplies, not necessarily produced in Syria, but controlled by Syria! That is where the control factor comes!

5744 2018-04-16 13:30:52 my experience is that there's no such thing as 'closure'. you can shut that door, but there will always be a space where the light shines through, the oil trickles out, or shadows pass by.
5745 2018-04-16 13:30:49 Can't agree more, Syria is a geopolitical war instigated by the west, mainly US, to control the oil and region, aided by Israel I have no doubt. It's a mess and the narrative is being fought in the media by western stooges

5757 2018-04-16 13:29:43 This isn’t even close to true. Entire tax codes were re-written to support the oil industry. How many hundreds of millions of tax payer dollars did you party, while in gov, spend promoting the industry?

5761 2018-04-16 13:29:17 Not everyone gets everything served on the golden platter with oil money. There are times when genuine people work hard to achieve success. Try to recognize it sometimes, oil, money and Shaikh won't last forever :p
5762 2018-04-16 13:29:10 the US is occupying, alongside the remnants of AQ and ISIS, the areas in syria where the majority of these reserves are, and in turn, “Syria (would) buy oil from ISIS” because why not- oil is worthless to ISIS (or anyone) unless they are selling it!

5766 2018-04-16 13:28:57 Sadly, until the price of oil increases we will not see major improvements in our revenue, with or without more pipelines.

5792 2018-04-16 13:26:37 Expect mo na na madumi tenga at hikaw/pakaw. Linisin mo ng baby oil tapos alcohol. Pagkalinis, balik mo ulit sa tenga mo. Pag nabalik mo, good sign na yan haha. Yung akin medyo sumasakit pa pag nagagalaw kaya pagkalinis ko ng after 1 month, sinuotan ko ulit hikaw, tapos..
5793 2018-04-16 13:26:24 I think monument makes the distinction of commemorating the "first big oil field" in OK instead of the first discovery of oil in OK.  I guess it just depends on what you consider "big."
5794 2018-04-16 13:26:04 He was shite because he was put in a position (line) he wasn’t ready for, average Oil fan doesn’t know any better which is the same as our management
5795 2018-04-16 13:25:51 Arizona, too.
5796 2018-04-16 13:25:46 Oil under the skin bumps rarely dry discolouration but don’t need a full coverage maybe like light to medium and my face is darker than my neck so always either look too dark or too ashy

5800 2018-04-16 13:25:32 @citylordmayor The issue of TRUST is the oil that keeps the engine of trade running and is fundamental in improving welfare globally
5801 2018-04-16 13:25:25 Thank you on behalf of Canadians. These projects have environmental due diligence, create First Nations jobs, decrease our massive deficit & lowers our pump price. Yes, good to have a refinery built in Alberta, however, big $$s. Better to have surplus oil & refineries @ capacity
5802 2018-04-16 13:25:24 nak letak dkt rumah. oil cleanser dkt rumah dah habis. yg scrub tu ingat nak bg kakcik  tapi balik hujung minggu aku boleh tumpang jugak hehe
5803 2018-04-16 13:25:19 #Scotland should build more. There is a great opportunity for those countries that see the future and act now. #Norway has put it's head into a barrel of oil.
5804 2018-04-16 13:25:14 Clarksons SP Market Update: Demand for palm oil remains lacklustre from both Indian and Chinese buyers and freight rates will likely fall in April and May. #SpecialisedProducts #ClarksonsShipping #PalmOil #India #China #FreightRates
5805 2018-04-16 13:25:07 わたしくるみんの声めっっっっちゃ好きなんですよねーーーーーー！！！！！！！
って前イプした時に言った気がした
5806 2018-04-16 13:25:02 "30 on me Run up and you know what's it's gone be spray the bull head like oil sheen"  Gherbo ran that
5807 2018-04-16 13:24:57 うわぁぁoilちゃんそんな風に言ってくれてありがとう
私の方こそ最初怖がっちゃってごめんね
今は全然そんな事思ってないよ(*;-;*)!!!むしろ大好きです
5808 2018-04-16 13:24:57 Russia needs oil to go up. So far the plan is working. It's about the oil. Gassing children gets everyone on board.
5809 2018-04-16 13:24:54 How often does Oil pipes burst and burn Villagers all over Nigeria, I don't see the freedom in such a tragic situation and I doubt if Insurance compensates the Victims families
5810 2018-04-16 13:24:51 お疲れ様です
5811 2018-04-16 13:24:48 Ang ginawa ko sakin non, nililinis ko sya sa first few weeks. Di ko tinatanggal pero cotton buds lang tapos baby oil para malinis konti. Tiis kahit mej masakit. After a month, tinatry ko ng tanggalin, tancha muna if kaya na. Ayun, nakaya na tapos nilinis ko hikaw saka tenga ko
5812 2018-04-16 13:24:40 I wonder if documentaries on oil fields are appropriately rated for any crude humor.
5813 2018-04-16 13:24:11 Refining in Alberta is THE solution. Refine dilbit on site, build a new, safer than the existing pipeline to export refined oil. Everybody happy. Ship more Dilbit through BC? NFW.
5814 2018-04-16 13:24:08 Oil jumped 8.6% last week and closed at $67.39/ barrel - its highest level since 2014, gold went up to $$1,347.90 /ounce. #oil #gold #Nymex #comex
5815 2018-04-16 13:24:03 And Venezuela and China are planning to stop trading oil in dollars.  If more countries abandon the petro-dollar, that will further weaken our currency.
5816 2018-04-16 13:23:56 We ended last night's session with me oiling my hammer with holy oil standing outside the wall of flame snarling at the three headed undead lich king thing. And I have 27 hp. 
5817 2018-04-16 13:23:54 Gotta get an oil change, wash clothes, go to the store and post office and I still wanna go to the gym
5818 2018-04-16 13:23:54 i took two paracetamols, two migraine pills, i applied medicated oil on my head and neck are but headache’s not leaving me. i want to cry.
5819 2018-04-16 13:23:22 Mang inasal is not worth it without the chicken oil.
5820 2018-04-16 13:23:22 NO WORRY , AMBANI HAS KG D6  OIL , ADANI HAS COAL & POWER . 
5821 2018-04-16 13:23:16 Sarkozy was a real scammer / liar..

He received millions of Euros from dictator Gaddafi. Then the Arab oil countries knew that he could easily be bought. They offered 7 times more money to just eliminate that Gaddafi.

Sarkozy has implemented the plans of those Gulf states.
5822 2018-04-16 13:23:16 Avocado toast is unreal. Hopefully you added the olive oil and lemon
5823 2018-04-16 13:23:15 Why are reporters still talking to @KellyannePolls?? Seriously. Why are @CNN and @ChrisCuomo giving her a platform to LIE? It’s absurd and boring. Also, could someone get that woman a hot oil treatment and a brush? Where is the tax payer funded style team?
5824 2018-04-16 13:23:09 ah, nice. Your experience gives me more confidence that it's not snake oil
5825 2018-04-16 13:23:05 Pure snake oil.

5827 2018-04-16 13:23:02 oil rallying and the failure to shift USDSAR when situation was a lot more stressed ... need oil to take a dive
5828 2018-04-16 13:23:02 Well it was probably 50% oil
5829 2018-04-16 13:22:52 Oil World told, Argentina will import soybeans from Paraguay in March/Feb 2018/19, assuming that imports from other origins are limited- @TradeADMIS
5830 2018-04-16 13:22:42 Russia has something on Trump who imposed sanctions 2x, more this week, bombs Syria, kills 200+ Russians in Syria, has effected Russias oil production, kicked out 60 Russian diplomats from US, criticizes poisoning father and daughter, is someone who has something on them! Stupid
5831 2018-04-16 13:22:41 Oil World told, world exports of soya meal may be trimmed to a 5-year low in April/Sept 2018 even if US exports increase- @TradeADMIS
5832 2018-04-16 13:22:36 Aiit Allah bada sa'a
5833 2018-04-16 13:22:19 I could not agree more even snake oil salesmen have to pay taxes.
5834 2018-04-16 13:22:17 俺もお見合い大作戦参加するか
5835 2018-04-16 13:22:09 Our bottles use an orifice reducer, that way all of it doesn't come out at once and you only get the drops your purposefully need. That way you don't have to deal with a dropper of oil you don't use. We found it was much easier to use this way.
5836 2018-04-16 13:22:04 Aku berharap tea tree oil ni membantu... dah penat sangat ni
5837 2018-04-16 13:21:56 In all honesty, you used to think the President has no control over gas prices. Well in fact he does. If he were to do something stupid like say start a tariff war with a large importer, that in turn is going to affect the stock market negatively which will drive oil prices up.
5838 2018-04-16 13:21:40 Lil wayne "find out where you stay and we act like we found some oil nigga "
5839 2018-04-16 13:21:37 No I’m not stupid actually. And if you actually read the replies to me instead of just being rude you’d see that my grandfather was partially right, except it was oil not steel being traded.
5840 2018-04-16 13:21:35 we are up against capitalism, totalitarianism, billionaires, corporate media, industrial military complex, bankers, oil companies... I DON'T HAVE TIME TO BLAME VICTIMS!!!
5841 2018-04-16 13:21:34 Eh
5842 2018-04-16 13:21:29 Not to mention that the idea of RU devaluing its currency has the most negligible effect in int’l markets as it is not widely traded or used in int’l commercial transactions. Oil and gas contracts are not in rubles.

5844 2018-04-16 13:21:21 I need an oil change, but it's snowing and raining, and I literally don't have one of my wipers right now, so this is a bit of a necessity. 
5845 2018-04-16 13:21:17 My oil fired boiler had the same problem.

5854 2018-04-16 13:20:16 It's plain to see how entrenched oil subsidies are and hearing the lengths these politicians are prepared to go is discouraging when we want Canada to pull it's weight in the struggle to keep our planet liveable. Wrong direction @JustinTrudeau @RachelNotley foolish and dangerous!

MPA did good work 
They brought oil refinery to kohat 
So many things in his favour
5872 2018-04-16 13:17:36 We discount oil currently because of poor delivery. That amounts to a mere $15.6 billion loss per year. That will drop to $10.6 billion as additional rail comes online. The railway will deliver that oil across the mountains to BC on rail lines beside your most major rivers.

5874 2018-04-16 13:17:28 The olympics are not the barometer for more people coming to Calgary. Oil prices are. I have seen multiple boom and bust cycles. Nothing else will turn this city around. 
Olympic Security costs alone will sink us, no cost recovery there. You can pay my share please.
5875 2018-04-16 13:17:23 DRINKABLE WATER should be in the countrys “National Interest”, and DRINKABLE WATER should also be a slightly higher priority than the profits of a foreign oil company. This should not be a far out concept.  WHY IS IT!?!

5885 2018-04-16 13:15:56 Yes. Ironic that Trump is complaining that Comey made it worse for HRC, not better, and that was somehow harmful to Trump. Proving once again that a skilled snake oil salesman/Conman like Trump can sell even bad news as good news.
5886 2018-04-16 13:15:51 russia currency decline vs. usd has more to do with price of crude oil plus sanctions than active intervention.  real interest rates in russia are quite positive.

We have problems, but they're not insurmountable and we're not under siege as they like to claim we are.

5901 2018-04-16 13:13:57 You're deluded. Pipelines are a far more efficient and safe mode of transport for oil and other liquids.
5902 2018-04-16 13:13:54 For gods sake people if you dont need to go anywhere today.. DONT !
You also REALLY dont need to get your oil changed or tires changed on a day like this. SMH 
5903 2018-04-16 13:13:46 Branded are search terms like:
Beardbrand
Tree Ranger
Four Vices, etc. 

Generic are terms like 
Beard Oil
Beard Care
Beard Shampoo, etc.

It'd be great to be able to make generic search a bigger chunk of that pie; but it's hard to get profitable conversions that way.

*As opposed to spoken of as "the before-time" around oil barrel fires, or referred to in history shows as "the dark times before The Orange One assumed the Godhead, tremendous be His name."
5908 2018-04-16 13:13:08 We have our own oil. We don't have to import that anymore, and why we still do is beyond belief.
5909 2018-04-16 13:13:07 The dollar strengthened after markets were convinced that the strike was a once-off event, but global equity markets weakened and Brent Crude Oil reached its highest price since 2014 at 72 USD/barrel. 1/2

5934 2018-04-16 13:10:34 I do also wonder the reasons why they changed from Atlas Oil to Ellingson Mineral. I thought Atlas Oil had a good ring to it. A lot seems to come from an early version of the script. Where some of these things were actually intended to be in the film.

5949 2018-04-16 13:09:21 Policy alone can't help when opec dumps oil specifically to target projects like the oil sands.

Really the oil sands shouldn't exist as is. It's too fragile to market pressures.

I'd rather spend tax$$ on research into making oil sands cheaper
5950 2018-04-16 13:09:18 It's a centrized "stable coin" supposedly pegged to a Venezuelan barrel of oil.

5964 2018-04-16 13:07:28 Canada’s oil and natural gas sector contributes $1.5 billion to the provincial government but it is estimated that it could go as high as $2.4 billion per year. This is money for health care, education and infrastructure.

6039 2018-04-16 12:59:16 Apparently, Russia and China deliberately keep their currency at the lower value so that they have an advantage in exports (lower price of good, higher demand). Russia benefits from exporting oil and gas, China benefits from... producing everything else.
6040 2018-04-16 12:59:13 It's true...

6069 2018-04-16 12:55:47 Do you really think we can have a functioning economy without coal, oil, or gas? I don't. Not if we want to keep the lights on and have airports.
6070 2018-04-16 12:55:45 This isn't an oil war this is the war for the world, they have openly attack what they call a regime that Russia is in full favour of to provoc a reaction, all this just to build a new silk road, please everyone wake up and do your own research
6071 2018-04-16 12:55:44 Because carbon emissions come from other sources not just electricity and we must fund   the transition from oil and natural gas to an electric economy

Good thing we didn’t stop investing in tires tech and roads/repair, just because experts thought it would be a waste. Things change, but oil will be here 50-100 years. We need infrastructure.

6090 2018-04-16 12:54:20 I guess if you can’t have spring, Olive Oil brought-over-with-great-effort from Greece is a good substitute. It tastes like sunshine.
6091 2018-04-16 12:54:17 I suppose you ignore that fact that  B.C. has over 43,000 kilometres of pipelines. If you took that oil out of the pipelines, we would need 4,200 rail cars to move it. How many of those cars would you like rolling through your community?

6097 2018-04-16 12:53:24 In Canada,  you can be getting lots of other vegetable oil & sugar in your so-called peanut butter & much less in the way of the peanut goodness. Add to this that amount of peanuts can be "proprietary". In peanut butter?! Ridiculous! At least be forthcoming with amount of peanuts
6098 2018-04-16 12:53:13 if you study anything about the history of middle east you will find that most of the ultra conservative governments you mention were q reaction to usa interference. USA is there for the oil, it doesnt care about the people.

It is under capacity, so the expansion with increase raw material and will increase finished product in the lower mainland.

6197 2018-04-16 12:42:03 What paints are you using on Yupo? I’ve been using Durular for years for my collages along with gouache and acrylic inks, sometimes oil sticks. Recently discovered that Yupo and alcohol acrylic inks are a marriage made vibrant.
6198 2018-04-16 12:41:46 “Data is not the new oil, it’s the new sun it’ll never get depleted and reenergises” @schmarzo  much better metaphor! #2018Analytics
6199 2018-04-16 12:41:40 The decision to encourage indigenous participation in the upstream sector of the oil and gas industry is a great one but Why the undue Injustice against Malabu? #MalabuAnotherAngle
6200 2018-04-16 12:41:38 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.
6201 2018-04-16 12:41:38 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
6202 2018-04-16 12:41:35 Church and state are like oil and water...don’t mix
6203 2018-04-16 12:41:24 RT @daviddomoney Got damp grass that needs cutting? Apply a light coating of cooking oil to the underside & the blades of the mower before you start. The oil will reduce the amount of wet grass on the mower making it easy to clean. Remove the oil afterwards with WD-40! #gardentip
6204 2018-04-16 12:41:19 Look at all the debt Alberta has accumulated, what has oil done for them? Big oil companies are doing just fine while dragging this country down.
6205 2018-04-16 12:41:17 Syria oil is less than 0,01% of US oil. Is he serious? 
6206 2018-04-16 12:40:56 No but RBL-priced Oil does...

6210 2018-04-16 12:40:44 Harper had 10 yrs to get a pipeline to carry oil to the overseas market but he failed to do so. How does Scheer expect that he can do any better. His biggest concern is that Trudeau will do it.
6211 2018-04-16 12:40:40 If taking action in Syria has consequences then it hasn't bothered Russia!
Agree re Saudi.
It's about ensuring chemical weapon use doesn't become normalised. There's not much oil in Syria anyway and more to do with Russia wanting a Med port in a controlled country.

6227 2018-04-16 12:39:07 I may or may not have put way too much coconut oil in my hair 
6228 2018-04-16 12:38:58 well, this is just entirely false. Oil projects have almost always had some form of government support, especially the oil sands. Why would you lie about this?
How about telling us what you would do instead.

6235 2018-04-16 12:38:18 thanks, makes sense! I've always felt a wood stove etc. wouldn't work here because our fireplace is on the upper level so the heat wouldn't reach the downstairs. but maybe I should rethink. Anyhow, my oil share for this month is 1100 pounds co2E. yuck!
6236 2018-04-16 12:38:13 The tax law is some bullshit snake oil. But you're a shill. So I expect nothing less then the full court press.

6252 2018-04-16 12:35:50 as most currency's are traded on the stock market so anyone and indeed anything can affect it. for example if oil companies changed from the dollar to the pound overnight then the dollar wouldn't be worth the paper it's written on

6341 2018-04-16 12:22:52 For more comparisons, 1 MT = 4x10e15 joules. In other words, it took 2 MT to create Meteor Crater in AZ. Half a MT is also the equivalent energy available in about 500,000 barrels of crude oil, or about how much the entire state of FL consumes as gasoline each day.

6345 2018-04-16 12:22:08 Zactly. Let's not forget when the IPO topic came to the scene: When oil price hit rock bottom in Q1 2016. It sprung about just to keep the market sentiment bullish about oil. That's all.

6643 2018-04-16 11:39:43 Tonight I have discovered that puppers likes both coconut oil and tuna (separately). 

This could bode well for dinner time 
6644 2018-04-16 11:39:37 That’s what this war is all about oil.
6645 2018-04-16 11:39:34 Drink Water. Meditate. Lather yourself in coconut oil. Get you nails done. Read books. Start a business. Mind yours. 
6646 2018-04-16 11:39:19 None of the oil in this proposed pipeline will be used domestically. And no one is suggesting Canada stop producing gasoline immediately. But the changeover must accelerate much faster than it's happening now.
6647 2018-04-16 11:39:15 This is a polarizing statement. The oil sands (or their emissions) do need to wind down. But they have two generations to do it. 

The problem with the pipeline is that it incentivizes increased production over this period.
6648 2018-04-16 11:38:44 So its NOT possible you are holding on to a lie? That Trump's behavior and MANY actions he has taken & we see everyday are not indicative of serious wrong doing?

6733 2018-04-16 11:28:02 Alternatively, instead of producing petcoke, heavy oil can be upgraded through hydrogen addition instead of carbon rejection.   This make more liquid oil, but costs more and requires significant hydrogen production, which has the side effect of additional carbon emissions.

6744 2018-04-16 11:26:44 Wife & I got some CBD oil so we may sleep better (it worked), but a few days in and my sweetbuns started acting like the supply officer of a shipwreck. 

Every drop used is catalogued, rationed. She stands guard over it night and day. Is this normal ? Did I marry a crazy person ?

6769 2018-04-16 11:21:21 A quick look at the landscapes left by the tar sands shows that our environmental standards aren't adequate.   Also, the fisheries act and the navigable waters act were gutted by Harper to help the oil industry.  And, in the end the oil is burned, which is the main problem.

6898 2018-04-16 10:59:56 Sorry Please, does hot oil mean you will heat the oil and apply it hot?
6899 2018-04-16 10:59:33 That is correct, to a point. But the true costs of burning coal and oil aren’t reflected in their price. The energy market fails to properly account for the side effects of burning fossil fuel, e.g. #ClimateChange.
6900 2018-04-16 10:59:22 #HealthyTip : Coconut oil can burn fat and promote weight loss, according to a study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.
6901 2018-04-16 10:59:09 Misery is collateral damage literally..think about how much the taxpayer has to find to afford those missiles being fired..its not small change..many would work lifetimes in taxes to fire just one..then there is control of the region..a hub of energy in gas n oil to supply the eu
6902 2018-04-16 10:59:06 When oil prices fell below the cost of refining bitumen and stayed there foreign oil companies sold off $60B of their stranded tar sands assets to unwary Canadians, because they’re in the business of making money, not losing it. What part don’t you get? Enron 2.0 is a pipe dream.
6903 2018-04-16 10:58:55 You ever feel so bad that you need coconut oil and pomegrante juice put in an IV just for you?

6917 2018-04-16 10:56:05 It’s not about wanting oil and gas for yourself, it about “whoever controls the oil, food, rules the world” (Kissinger) in other words it about US/UK/ France hegemony.

6919 2018-04-16 10:55:37 No sorry it’s not jousting, it’s all to do with oil and the might buck. Two pipelines with differing backers may well be the root cause. Case in point is Yemen with no pipeline, no bucks, and no intervention from UK

The only way in which Chelsea's and Man City's spend can impact Arsenal is when we play either Chelsea or Man City. That's it. Four games out of 38. Those two clubs have nothing to do with the fact that we are on 54 points in the league mid-April.
6925 2018-04-16 10:54:50 The problem is there is very little demand for what you are selling, and Kinder Morgan, a Texas oil company spin of from Enron, knows that, that is why they are angling for taxpayers to take the risk

6936 2018-04-16 10:53:05 Sorry , I heard you say supply level on the 4hr on oil , you took a trade, hypertheticly if that level matched supply levels on the daily and weekly chart would that improve the probability of that trade ... I will not ask about any trade not on your radar ,

7023 2018-04-16 10:37:42 First, is the possible inflow of high level international players/sportsmen & women to the country. 
Second, is the increase in non oil revenue to Nigeria in form of tax from earning of these sports guys.
Third is the direct & indirect employment.
7024 2018-04-16 10:37:40 Former Californian here. My understanding is it’s largely middle class folks fed up with how CA is being run, like my parents. Driving up housing prices for sure, but at least politically compatible
7025 2018-04-16 10:37:23 And oil is also down nearly $1 per barrel. Again I say I think that it is overdone unless there is action against Russian bonds
7026 2018-04-16 10:37:22 In Florida North, we only get 3,5 hours of usable power per day. (9:30 - 13:00). We were promised we would be stabilised by today, only now to be told the Moble Transformer is also broken (oil Leak) why was this not checked BEFORE getting all our hopes up and then dashing them?
7027 2018-04-16 10:37:15 You don't live in B.C. This was a sham with C Clark going being our backs. 

This is for a few jobs for Canadians.lining pockets of the U.S. and we reap the repercussions.

Amready had an oil spill recently. It takes years and decades to recover the marine eco system.
7028 2018-04-16 10:37:04 Almost 2years after flagoff, the proposed Ogoni cleanup hasn't witnessed a single drop of oil cleaned from the soil.
7029 2018-04-16 10:36:38 Grab some @muc_off degreaser and oil, follow the instructions, done! I use their stuff across all my bikes and it’s pretty great. Their ceramic-wet lube has looked after me this winter.
7030 2018-04-16 10:36:25 Rs will join any Dem bill as long as it doesn’t negatively impact on the Kochs, the oil & gas industry, defense contractors, gun merchants, top 1% or evangelicals.
7031 2018-04-16 10:36:17 The gas pipelines do not cover the whole of the country. Example, I wanted to change to gas from oil. Living in Derry. Pipeline runs across the main road at top of my street. Firmus told me I'd need 6 neighbours willing to go to gas before they'd extend pipes. Ridiculous.
7032 2018-04-16 10:35:59 gonna wrap them with foiled with lemon and olive oil/garlic
but depends on what kind of fish on sale rn I might go do pan fried with light flour and salt coating

7034 2018-04-16 10:35:32 They have the resources  but do they really have the interest ??? There is still to much oil to burn...
7035 2018-04-16 10:35:29 Girl let me rub your body down with Johnson & Johnson Baby Oil  & let me give u a Full Body Massage
7036 2018-04-16 10:35:15 Assad has the majority support of Syria. The US should give up their greedy Zio-imperialist agenda & stop supporting AlQaeda & all of AlQaedas subsidiary groups & get out of Syria as USA is in Syria illegally & has no right to anything that belongs to Syria. Not oil, not land: 0

7067 2018-04-16 10:29:36 Yes but they are our tyrants and they only commit  nice murder and the human rights abuses are for the good of all did I mention they supply oil at reasonable prices and buy large quantities of arms from us.
7068 2018-04-16 10:29:27 The Times has not given any coverage at all, has it, to the publication of the guideline? Not the benefits, not the problems, not the implications? Is this not of greater importance and relevance to people than turmeric oil on dogs?
7069 2018-04-16 10:29:22 In the week to 15th April, equities were up around a percent and bonds were down slightly. The oil price was up over 8% as Russia, China and Iran compete with Saudi Arabia and the USA over the need to price oil in US dollars.

It great to be #Tory
7075 2018-04-16 10:28:04 So the doctor said that the reason for my right ear pain is that it's 100% completely blocked by wax so I guess that's on me. She also said that my left ear is close to completely blocked too so I gotta out olive oil down both ears twice a day for a week.
7076 2018-04-16 10:27:53 Currently using Bio Oil as I'm pregnant - also used it for a scar on my face after having a large cyst removed. Husband suffers from severe Migraines. Email Fiona@savvyinsomerset.com

7078 2018-04-16 10:27:28 The 3.3 Billion in oil/gas subsidies you promised to end would support:
6600 fossil fuel jobs
46,200 jobs in energy refitting buildings
49.500 jobs in renewable power generation.
Talk is cheap, @JustinTrudeau .
7079 2018-04-16 10:27:24 What is wrong with oil?  Doesn't oil provide Canada a lot of funds?
7080 2018-04-16 10:27:17 Yup! And they probably don't even know about leaded petrol spiking levels of atmospheric lead and making everyone dumber! We fixed that one with legislation, but oil companies fought it crazy hard.

7094 2018-04-16 10:25:04 Sometimes we mash. Sometimes we're in hot oil. Sometimes we're baked. Sometimes it's a longer process but the results are drunken shenanigans. Yes, potatoes are a great metaphor for relationships :)

A big, hungry market may also open up next door and we could potentially import cheaper oil too. If this isn’t enough, international cricket is returning to Pakistan, too.

7106 2018-04-16 10:22:55 The PMs argument is spot on it terms of the strategic long term value of the oil industry to Canada. It is as important as Forestry, Auto and Aerospace. 

What’s disheartening is the attempt to appease rich eco- terrorists who feed off fear and falsehoods.

7122 2018-04-16 10:19:14 Yes, it seemed like a season with few highlights. A team ravaged by rotten draft choices and generally a lack of attention by the Oil but with a few more college signings and the 2017 draftees hitting the ice we can look for better.

7129 2018-04-16 10:17:37 A friend used the rosehip oil at the end of her skincare routine to “lock up the moisture” or whatever the lingo was  and loved it. I heard that squalane is more suitable for oily skin so I use instead, since it absorbs quickly + is very moisturizing.

7154 2018-04-16 10:12:14 There is not! It’s essentially just button mushrooms, walnuts, garlic and some spice. I will unearth the recipe today. There might be coconut oil involved, or maybe olive.

7161 2018-04-16 10:10:15 You do realise that "oor resources" such as oil isn't actually oors? Oil belongs to oil companies, none of which are actually Scottish, its just tax revenue! 
7162 2018-04-16 10:09:52 Different skin different effect kot. You try about 2-3 days ada any effect x. I obviously effect dr oil cleansing ni sebab I tak change any routine yg lain huhuhu
7163 2018-04-16 10:09:16 =Apr14=  FORECAST: The Crude oil price may still jump,
but next it will necessarily fall.  After escalation in Syria - Crude Oil will be collapse from any height levels.

7164 2018-04-16 10:09:15 Is  Fired Sec. of State Rex Tillerson working behind the scenes to pump up oil prices and hurt his former boss?
Just something to think about. These people are very egocentric, and MAGA is not their #1 priority.
7165 2018-04-16 10:09:14 OK, Diaper Don, surely you know that the mission will never be accomplished until Big Oil mafiosos seize the Caspian Sea oil fields from Iran and Russia. Didn’t the CIA clue you in?

7167 2018-04-16 10:08:38 They can easily use the port for grain alone. At least that's an all Canadian product stuck w/o transport yet again and no mention from MSM of this b/c it's oil they would want you to think is the grandest moneymaker myth.
7168 2018-04-16 10:08:27 I believe your sir, but this is a complot of the big powers. There must be a good reason why they have been in the Arab countries for so long and no it's not oil. Unfortunately I don't know what it is.
7169 2018-04-16 10:07:50 I brought beard oil and some balm yesterday, I’ve become everything I’ve ever hated.

7175 2018-04-16 10:07:01 #Oil prices fell sharply and government bond yields rose on Monday on expectations that the weekend's missile attacks on #Syria would not mark the start of greater Western involvement in the conflict. @i24NEWS_EN

7181 2018-04-16 10:06:21 Garlic, Nduja, olive oil, cherry tomatoes, tender stem broccoli, parsley, fusilli and a scattering of Parmesan. Sit outside during heatwave.
7182 2018-04-16 10:06:16 This has nothing to do with Corbyn and everything to do with competing gas pipelines and oil in the Golan. Hence the Russia and US vetoes to protect their respective economic interests.
7183 2018-04-16 10:06:16 right on.  we are not the blind people he thinks we are.  it is all about the oil.

7190 2018-04-16 10:04:05 What's city without oil money? Even they can announce themselves as champions they will always struggle to grip European atmosphere
7191 2018-04-16 10:03:59 American/Israeli  strategy intends the balkanization of Syria so that Israel can claim  the Golan Heights and Genie oil can start drilling there. Ira Greenstein, white house strategist, friend of Kushner is its president. On its board: Cheney,  Woolsey,  Murdoch, Rothshield.
7192 2018-04-16 10:03:52 It's not oil money it's gas money. And UEFA is doing nothing to stop this - that was Nick's point. Of course UEFA isn't financing PSG.

7205 2018-04-16 10:00:09 The causality with cannabis hasn't been established yet. With low THC strains and lots of other cannabinoids, there may be some preventative function. I wonder if B12 supplements might show up as effective as fish oil.

7210 2018-04-16 09:58:39 Probably helped City win the league because their right back didn’t ask for a move for more money half way through the season. But as you want us to win a cup your stinky oil club aren’t in all is forgiven.
7211 2018-04-16 09:58:38 Do your mask frequently.  Take care of your hair and scalp.  Apply your hair tonic twice a day.  Use essential oil and tea to help you relax.  Drink your green tea an hour after lunch.  Just throw your green tea pack into your water bottle.
7212 2018-04-16 09:58:28 One of the countries has oil.
7213 2018-04-16 09:58:22 So the catastrophe in Iraq (and the collateral disasters for the whole region, including Syria) following  Blair's tryst with US oil barons is upsetting for the lofty, selective, theologians of Empire in London Liberal coffee houses..... and 'hail Trump'!
7214 2018-04-16 09:58:11 Governments don’t wanna bomb Syria to control them it’s cos they’ve got a shit tonne of oil!!!!!!

7218 2018-04-16 09:56:58 Absolutely false. There are no alternatives to oil for transportation. A few electic cars, sure. Planes that bring tourists to NZ for our largest export earner? No. Ships to export our produce to the world? No. No alternatives. None. Learn some facts.

7221 2018-04-16 09:56:03 Building new pipelines and maintaining very old pipelines (#MarinerEast was built in the 1930s) across very unstable geology, as is the case here, is MORE dangerous than maintaining oil & gas infrastructure affected by melting permafrost, as Pennsylvania is more densely populated

7223 2018-04-16 09:55:53 We wanted know more beyond d royalties, taxes etc.  d oil and gas industry was paying. We wanted to know d processes particularly in procurement.

7225 2018-04-16 09:55:46 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
7226 2018-04-16 09:55:35 Weird that, the US pretend to bomb #ISIS, yet keep giving them protection, bankrolling them, treating their injured, giving them air cover, evacuating them, buying the oil they steal...
7227 2018-04-16 09:55:25 The coalition strike in #Syria was for: distraction from domestic #USA issues; maintain a constant, even if low, flow of new orders for the military industry; raising the #oil prices; #France testing new weapons . #politics #geopolitics #corporations
7228 2018-04-16 09:55:17 What were you expecting? 

The progressive program got shortened by “the wee surprise” so JA has a few things to get locked in before handing over to Winston. 
In less than 12mths: $2B family package; new petrol taxes;bans on gas & oil exploration etc. 

It’s typical Labour.

7230 2018-04-16 09:55:12 @MedvedevRussiaE Control of oil market together with Saudi Arabia will give you a lot of maneuver space. Need a 5% stake of Chinese oil market from Saudi Arabia in change for discount on weapons contracts. Saudi Arabia are tired by American dominance.

7233 2018-04-16 09:54:42 DCEU Superman doesn't care about saving people. 

That's why he gave up a job at the start of Man of Steel to help trapped people on an oil rig, why he sacrifficed his life to stop Doomsday, why he killed Zod and why Lois was able to track him down by talking to the people he had
7234 2018-04-16 09:54:38 Extra Virgin Olive Oil displays a wide spectrum of flavours & aromas.

7235 2018-04-16 09:54:32 Do Sultans like oil?
7236 2018-04-16 09:54:16 true, but they haven't the necessary qualifications to merit assistance .. they are the wrong colour, wrong religion and have no oil. end of. 
7237 2018-04-16 09:54:11 Try black seed oil and ionic silver preparations. Obviously, man made patented drugs are not working.

7242 2018-04-16 09:53:49 #toryplague Tory humaitarian intervention appears to be on the grounds of making sure Oil reserves arent hurt and remain  available, Iraq , Syria Libiya , Humanitarian concern about yemen = supplying the saudis with Arms to commit genocide & Bootout Windrush people
7243 2018-04-16 09:53:32 Shocking truth: The world is run by people who have a lot of money and are willing to spend it. The oil and gas industry falls into that category. Not only mainstream journalism but also universities and think tanks are prone to the influence of oil money.
7244 2018-04-16 09:53:23 Don't we export almost all of our oil anyway?
7245 2018-04-16 09:53:19 heres a fun fact for you the lithium mines are just as bad as oil even more so then oil and this cars and truck are a failure already unsafe just for a start let me know how you feel when your tesla is on the side of the road burning

7256 2018-04-16 09:51:04 The USD is losing reserve currency status as we speak, and it's also no longer the only currency used for oil sales. That will be pretty devastating. It's already down a buttload vs the Euro.

7258 2018-04-16 09:50:31 It's wonderful. I advise a sandalwood oil. Makes it really soft
7259 2018-04-16 09:50:20 Essentially all other major oil/gas producing states pay more in taxes. North Dakota developed a $3B fund from taxes. We are fools in Colorado where there is no substantive contribution to taxes by the companies.

7266 2018-04-16 09:48:56 If it was not for lack of Human Foresight & Greed  it is obvious that oil has not got long & it will run out, So it would be more Beneficial to encourage the Development Of Green Alternatives For Transporting Human Carcases fromA To B, 1k In yrs is a milli second of Life

7278 2018-04-16 09:46:45 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
7279 2018-04-16 09:46:43 Amazon. U can make your own toiletries using basics like olive oil, coconut oil, shea  butter, coffee, Brown sugar. Plus pure castille  liquid soap. Then for talc/deo mix bicarbonate of soda with tapioca starch + tiny drops of essential oils eg 'baby powder' fragrance. Avoid SLS.
7280 2018-04-16 09:46:34 It's bullshit to compare purchasable goods to a culture, which implies ethics and values. So should we accept Islam because oil comes from Saudi Arabia?  I don't think so.
7281 2018-04-16 09:46:22 Can camel caravans transport the oil?

7301 2018-04-16 09:42:22 Any update on the oil leak? Bcos this Load rotation is not making any sense, schedule is not being followed.
7302 2018-04-16 09:42:14 Why don't presstitutes write to Soudi Arabia & other oil rich Muslim countries for help ? You may donate your one month salary towards relief operations !
7303 2018-04-16 09:41:46 Foreign reserves increase because the price of oil has stabilized internationally. So Nigeria is simply getting more money from its oil than it did 3 years,  not a result of any specific policies. Foreign investors are also enticed by stability /security of which there is little.

7309 2018-04-16 09:41:28 The genie is out of the bottle, the whole struggle in Syria is about oil, very high placed people, formally from high places in the US government, are wanting to steal the oil discovered on the Golan Heights, The only way they can succeed

7333 2018-04-16 09:38:20 Yup, because they are still better than some wild countries with no money (losers). The US lost Iran under Carter, so I guess they really don’t want to lose Saudis. Saudis still Control oil, but it s a huge land, which could be all AQ if the West isn’t careful

7335 2018-04-16 09:37:45 While we should welcome solutions to conflict mining, the resource curse does not only affect the DRC. The focus on attaching "immoral" to adjectives for EVs obfuscates the persisting conflict for oil over the past century. Is it possible to conduct an LCA for conflict?

The economic growth u are talking now was just only in the oil sector but now,non oil sector is don't ng fantastically well. The growth now is real not oil that employs few people. Our import bill has reduced now
7378 2018-04-16 09:29:02 "Oil" is the favorite word of people building online dating profiles in the U.S. states of Texas, Oklahoma, and North Dakota.
7379 2018-04-16 09:28:56 I worked in the oil industry - can't get a job back there now.  Yes, there's been a recovery and things are slowly getting better but oil sells at $70 per barrell not north of $100 as it was at time of referendum. As for polls, maybe they're  right, maybe they're wrong.

7434 2018-04-16 09:18:26 @LBC why? It’s Regime Change in Syria and Russia. The West is after the oil and gas of which there is plenty in that part of the world. So Putin and Assad have to be made into monsters first of course as so many times since ww2, see the list @WillamBlum.com

7439 2018-04-16 09:15:06 It's growing given oil prices jump & electricity consumption rose. Fundamentally US economy extremely vulnerable to external shocks because mountain of debts may be repaid only if growth above 3%. Putin of course could trigger such external shock but thinks too early

7467 2018-04-16 09:09:46 You don't do the policy and service by pretending the policy won't cost jobs, Max. The jobs now would roll over to new extractions if oil and gas is found. That that won't happen now means those jobs won't continue, eventually.

is to restrain the wind
or to grasp oil in one's

Iron sharpens iron,

7521 2018-04-16 09:02:40 1) Because it’s unrefined bitumen & it will spill which is disastrous.
2) Additional refinery capacity to export refined product will reduce volume & risk.

7562 2018-04-16 08:57:01 As it's the case many times in the Middle East, #oil traders are selling after limited bombing campaign. Brent and WTI crude are down nearly 2% after one-off US-UK-France missile barrage in #Syria -- #OOTT
7563 2018-04-16 08:56:16 We only offer humanitarian help (by bombing) and interfere in civil wars with countries that have oil...funny that!
7564 2018-04-16 08:56:05 However, oil stocks underperformed the oil price by a very high margin.
7565 2018-04-16 08:55:53 #hemp can #stopwar. Hemp plastic kills three birds with one stone - it's  #biodegradable so causes less #pollution, the hemp plant turns c02 into oxygen so it heals some of the pollution and it's a replacement for the #oil industry which US and UK invade and wage #war for #Syria
7566 2018-04-16 08:55:53 Depends on where and how palm oil is produced. Criticism always warranted for poor practices. Hopefully majority of producers will follow the lead of those going out of their way to be sustainable
7567 2018-04-16 08:55:53 Oil money.
7568 2018-04-16 08:54:46 They can: Perhaps 'Oil Majors' can release the thousands of PATENTS they hold relating to fossil fuel alternatives & renewables / EVs,  etc, that would speed up the Renewables Revolution no end and would show that they are part of a Climate Change solution rather than the cause.

7572 2018-04-16 08:53:55 Flautas área often puto on very hot canola oil or similar, and then tortilla  become "hard". Tacos are made with fresh corn tortilla and are "soft". Not like taco Bell, never, and also  never, ever have cheddar cheese. (I am Mexican). Best regards Bella.
7573 2018-04-16 08:53:49 This was not in the national interest. 
Russia has said there will be consequences & we'll be targeted by ISIS in revenge attacks.
The UK sells arms to Saudi, takes no action on Yemen.
This is about trade deals with Trump & oil in Syria, nothing 'humanitarian' about it.
7574 2018-04-16 08:53:31 They can: "If you have lived through a century characterised by war, expropriation and the rise and fall of particular nations and empires you do know  something about adaptation." Especially if/when the oil majors had a hand in most of these conflicts.
7575 2018-04-16 08:53:25 Due diligence would that be Sec. Pruitt? Abandon all hope. Sec. Zinke Depart of the Interior. just as bad. He is selling all the land off to oil companies. Good luck sir you will need it.

7578 2018-04-16 08:53:10 And considering Syria only had 0.5% of all oil production in 2010, and 0.05% in 2016. 
The UK has more oil and gas reserves than Syria.

7580 2018-04-16 08:52:39 They can: Danish DONG / Orsted has shown that switching to Renwables is possible and the oil majors have the international networks and financial power to take advantage of the ever-growing need for precious metals & minerals in Renwables manufacturing.

7588 2018-04-16 08:51:33 They can. 'Oil Majors' are already making huge changes by selling their oil assets & shifting their focus on NATURAL GAS / LNG. Oil Majors have the ear of governments so could easily get them to switch the 5 trillion yearly fossil fuel subsidies to Renewable or mining projects.

7593 2018-04-16 08:50:46 This is a statement from a man who surround himself with those who don't say the Truth. Now he has learned not to say correct things without knowing. My native Proverb says.."it is he who touch palm oil that the oil rope"

7621 2018-04-16 08:45:55 It might need a good spin if the oil has separated a bit. But I dont think it would be bad bad unless it has mold on it.
7622 2018-04-16 08:45:39 Canadian oil is produced under much higher environmental standards than places like the Middle East. So instead of getting Canadian bitumen processed into the diesel fuel BCs economy relies on you buy it from dirtier producers with ties to terrorism. Makes sense

7660 2018-04-16 08:38:31 First, “Nigeria is an oil rich country.” False, because oil revenue per person per
annum in Nigeria in 2013 when crude oil prices averaged over US$100 per
barrel was US$520. In Qatar and Kuwait, it was US$31,000 and US$27,000 per

7958 2018-04-16 07:44:07 Anti-energy? Stop conflating fossil fuels with energy. Sunlight can be used to store energy. Wind can be used to store energy. In fact, fossil fuels are ultimately ancient solar energy, from plant matter hundreds of millions of years old, which eventually became coal, oil, etc.

7968 2018-04-16 07:42:08 A strong ruble will reduce revenues to the budget from rising oil prices. Ordinary citizens will be able to travel abroad again, and not to the Crimea and spend their money there. We will be able to buy more things.

7982 2018-04-16 07:38:09 It's commendable that the NPA has suspended oil companies who failed to declare their returns because when you do that, it means you're cheating the nation. - Dr. Kelvin Owusu #GHToday

7985 2018-04-16 07:38:01 Just one rebuttal for it... why did Syria buy oil from ISIS if it has all these reserves...
7986 2018-04-16 07:37:51 Ingredients?  I tried to poison my brother once with “fake” hot chocolate. I think mud, dandelions and engine oil were in the mix.

7992 2018-04-16 07:36:24 The easiest oil has already been found and used, up the next step is platform drilling which we are already doing, and the last step is to create deep sea rigs in places that would make landing on Venus seem easy, there will also be seams of unused coal left, what’s the next step
7993 2018-04-16 07:36:16 Well. . . It is hard to forget the whole 'Iraqi weapons of mass destruction' lie.
We had been bombing Saddam since January 1991.
12 years later he somehow had a WMD program?
Gimme a break. It was all about oil priced in Euros.
7994 2018-04-16 07:36:04 Since the outbreak of the conflict in Syria, Israel has awarded drilling rights for oil and gas in Israeli occupied Syria to a company called Genie Energy (board consists of J.Rothschild, Murdoch, Cheney) – that’s why the Syrian war is good for business.
7995 2018-04-16 07:35:38 Standard of living is a highly subjective thing. I expect electrification, say, will bring many benefits - clean air, quieter city, etc. No fear of oil spills! Pace of change could be much faster & people would barely notice.

8003 2018-04-16 07:34:30 He cud hav rather asked WHY they sell oil etc not what the price of a bottle is. if the Prophet wants to know the price, he can pick up the phone and call one of the sales people.he duznt need to bother himself with that when he has so many branches all over the world to oversee
8004 2018-04-16 07:33:56 Can't find my Versace Eros oil. I'm h'angry.
8005 2018-04-16 07:33:51 If only UK and other net importers could set the price of oil? They would shoot for $5-10/bbl to lower transportation and energy costs to boost economic performance.
8006 2018-04-16 07:33:28 I don't know if your skin tolerates it, but having a hot shower before and blathering my skin with oil while in the shower helps me, for the first few hours at least?
8007 2018-04-16 07:33:26 it's still an oil though. and it even says on the can "stops squeaks"
8008 2018-04-16 07:33:14 Saranku, mending kamu diet skincare aja, jangan langsung seabrek, apalagi habis dari dokter. Ambil yang basic tapi penting macem mc-fw-toner-moist-sunscreen. Tambahin face oil, itu bagus banget. Jangan pake exfo/scrub muka dulu, malah tambah jerawatan nanti

8017 2018-04-16 07:30:56 I jst used woolworths as an example to say u dnt call the church leader to ask him how much a bottle costs.Prophet Bushiri has also authored many books,I'm sure he duznt know the prices because he has a publishing team who manage that.He cud hav rather asked WHY they sell oil etc

8088 2018-04-16 07:15:23 We agree solar and wind are abundant, so much so that oil is also just extremely prescious solar energy. So I see the big picture, so why waste so much of that energy to convert it to hydrogen and back when I can do four times as much using a battery and the solar from my roof?

8097 2018-04-16 07:12:48 I’m anti-pipeline, but if you insist on building it for jobs, where are our refineries? We transitioned from Dilbit to refined petroleum products and back to dilbit. Phase oil out, but til then, let’s make our own products- refineries make everything safer from jobs to cleanup.

8107 2018-04-16 07:10:44 At the heart of it, reducing dependence on oil benefits us all. Alberta lost 9.9 billion in the fort Mac fire. BC had 1.3% of our land burn up last year.

Climate change is going to cost a lot more than the oil industry will make.
8108 2018-04-16 07:10:33 Does this suck for Albertans? Yup.

But expansion of oil is damn moronic. Other solutions are necessary.

8131 2018-04-16 07:05:36 China's ongoing strategic oil storage building program rarely gets mentioned alongside uplifting reports on non-OECD demand growth figures. Sure, demand growth is strong, but the picture isn't as rosy as $70+ Brent would indicate.
8132 2018-04-16 07:05:25 Saddam was still the first head of state to try departing from the petrodollar. Syria is more about fucked up political alliances than oil. US first got involved because they thought Assad was a Russian prop, friend of my enemy thing I think.

8182 2018-04-16 06:57:46 Just heard the biggest load of bullshit speculation on petrol by Ross Greenwood ever. Apparently petrol prices will rise cause of airstrikes in Syria. Not one single strike was near an oil field or hit roads or ports. What a utter con job. Syrian output doesn't even get here

8194 2018-04-16 06:54:22 Wasnt referring to ideology. They have multi million oil trade going on,  Syrian government is also part of that. Meaning they have contacts, deals, exchanges etc. While southern rebels dont have anything to do with ES or Idlib (apart from hts).

8239 2018-04-16 06:46:44 In theory, but it’s still not my first choice for “fatty element on a sandwich”. 1. Mashed avocado, 2. Fatty, soft cheese, 3. Salad dressing/oil, 4. Butter, 5. Flavored homemade mayo/aioli. And only 1 per sandwich/burger.

8249 2018-04-16 06:45:39 That’s silly! You think you couldn’t survive without oil. Really? If they wanted they would could produce alternatives, but the oil conglomerates quickly move in to stop that from happening.  When we deplete all fossil fuels, others sources will replace it, EASILY.. get it?

8284 2018-04-16 06:37:29 What makes u think the Chinese are so expectant? The only firm market for diluted bitumen is California.

8359 2018-04-16 06:20:48 Asian share markets were mixed and #oil prices fell on Monday as relief U.S.-led strikes on #Syria looked unlikely to escalate was tempered by concerns at #Russia's potential reaction to new sanctions from #Washington.
8360 2018-04-16 06:20:43 Main point,there is no credible evidence, they went on evidence from the social media, which even a 7 year old knows, can be manipulated/ fabricated. This is about oil, Saudi and Israel. If @theresa_may ( Mrs Bliar) really cared, will help Yemen and Palestine

2)DPRK,”Sorry can’t hear u over reunifying with South Korea”
3)Oil, oil, oil. Gang up on something that’s not yours.

8465 2018-04-16 06:05:27 What a surprise (not). The price of oil is going up due to the air strikes in Syria. Most of the world buys their oil using $$$$$, the petro-chemical dollar, so guess who benefits most? Who would have thought it, eh? #Syria #SyriaStrikes

8467 2018-04-16 06:05:21 Berry among the thorns,
Seed found in the sand,
My absence will be mourned,
When I find another clan. 

Icicle in the drink,
Water in the oil,
Separation’s what I think,
Before they make me spoil.

The pack is poisoned. 
The tribe is sick. 
Should I heal them?
Or run quick?

8469 2018-04-16 06:04:57 As the most aggressive polluter, I'd expect so. But I mean an effective climate plan, that's not been watered down with concessions to tar sands multinationals (concessions like say, another dirty oil pipeline). One that could make a difference to meeting Canada's targets?
8470 2018-04-16 06:04:43 :/ don’t do it girl, i’ve seen so many girls rip out their own lashes doing this even with coconut oil. you don’t want no nubzzzz
8471 2018-04-16 06:04:43 Aaand the fact bloody oil money will get you more than the other teams and will make agreeing upon that worth at that moment in time easier isn't one.

8486 2018-04-16 06:02:56 I talked to my dad about this last night.  He laughed at the idea that John Horgan is concerned about "shipping oil out of the Vancouver area" since, and I quote "they've been shipping oil out of the Vancouver area for 60 years",

8496 2018-04-16 06:01:14 I assume you are referring to the #OceansProtectionPlan, as there is no such thing as an Oceans Protection Act in Canada. It’s a pity BC missed out on an opportunity to make our marine oil spill response plan truly world class.

8557 2018-04-16 05:51:32 I've spent a lot of time up in Fort McMurray.  We are idiots for not upgrading ALL of our raw oil resource here in Canada.  All the pipeline does (as it stands right now) is export our raw unrefined resource instead of upgrading it domestically.

8580 2018-04-16 05:45:14 Wow. @AJWVictoriaBC is determined to lie his way out of having the pipeline. Dude, we have very many safeguards in place. The pipeline is GOOD for Canada's economy. Shipping by rail or truck isn't viable. How about you buy your oil elsewhere from now on. No soup for you!
8581 2018-04-16 05:45:10 I was concerned I wasn't getting enough fiber in my diet so I had rice & madras dal w/ a splash of chili oil for dinner.

8585 2018-04-16 05:44:41 Yep, that's why he has bombed Syria twice; put Sanctions on Russia, made oil independence a priority for the USA, AND insisted on a USA First Agenda-because he is Putin's Puppet. Unlike Obama/Clinton where there is VIDEO proof they kissed Putin's butt. You're a real intellectual.
8586 2018-04-16 05:44:37 And how do you transfer oil to Europe?
8587 2018-04-16 05:44:34 I am guessing you don’t have children dependent on the Gas & Oil industry.
8588 2018-04-16 05:44:32 It's not oil, it's bitumen.

I am expecting oil to pullback further so that won't be a good signal
8603 2018-04-16 05:42:00 Lmaooo I’m done with that oil 
8604 2018-04-16 05:41:38 But we did not attack Lebanon, nor Sudan, in that time period, nor since...oil in Somalia has only RECENTLY been looked for off shore, and is only now maybe doing some production...it was not about oil in 2001...they did not have much production, and it was disrupted by clashes.

8606 2018-04-16 05:41:24 @SteveSGoddard Just curious... Basic chemistry tells you that the combustion hydrocarbons (oil, natural gas, coal) with oxygen produces carbon dioxide. In your opinion, where does this go? Does it hang around in the atmosphere, or does the waste product of combustion just vanish?

8622 2018-04-16 05:39:33 Sunday nights are for to-do lists of all the things you need to to and mild anxiety paired with tea and candles and essential oil diffusers and ... idk where my brain went.
8623 2018-04-16 05:39:19 So happy my baby not balding I do not play with my coconut oil rubs 
8624 2018-04-16 05:38:58 For Saudi to even be shuttling oil from coast to coast via the Bab Al-Mandeb almost makes my eyes twitch out of irritation whenever I see it on the map. They are unnecessarily exposing their vessels to harm’s way, such as the recent case with the ABQAIQ attack by Houthi militias.
8625 2018-04-16 05:38:55 The Truth About War on Middle East is, had there be no OIL there, it would be like Africa, Nobody is treating to intervening Africa.

8630 2018-04-16 05:37:13 Very handy for cleaning off oil and road grime so you can see what you’re working on. Also essential in a country that’s rained on as much as ours... I spray plug leads and connections every winter.
8631 2018-04-16 05:37:01 Mark the son of Satan came to Nigeria to support the killer president installed by the wicked satanic British in killing and stealing #biafran oil and gas  shame on facebook losers
8632 2018-04-16 05:37:00 Absolutely shameful from the PM and I thought she was against brutality, or is that only when there’s countries with oil and that you’re prepared to bomb?

8640 2018-04-16 05:36:01 Because there's oil under Iraq.

8647 2018-04-16 05:34:04 Ah bummer, well it's just a suggestion and something to keep in mind, after all lotions made specially for skin so I guess that's what makes it better (at least for me) than oil...

8650 2018-04-16 05:33:48 2) Would same principles apply to attempts to apply climate policy to a specific activity, shipping oil in a pipeline, and claims that specific activity has more deleterious impacts/consequences than uses of the product for transportation, etc?

8666 2018-04-16 05:32:01 I wish people would give the whole oil angle a rest, especially in Syria. Assad and Putin contol it and neither USA, Saudi or Qatar have any wild ideas about pursuing it. It’s logistically illogical. Saudi should in fact just build a damn pipeline straight to the SUMED instead.

8685 2018-04-16 05:28:49 @MusicFromOz  Hi I was listening to Choirboys the other day are they still around. I loved Midnight Oil as well sadly couldnt get tiks for the uk tour last year.
8686 2018-04-16 05:28:30 Yeah and the Exxon Valdez wasn't meant to leak oil, and the Gulf of Mexico BP disaster wasn't on purpose either..  Maybe they can just say sorry and it'll all magically go away.  It was on purpose and irresponsibility, ignorance and lack of safety was deliberate way to save $$'y!
8687 2018-04-16 05:28:29 Congress still wondering if data can be retrieved from the cloud on clear days.
8688 2018-04-16 05:28:28 You are right, but ETH is meant to be oil, and the monetary policy will sustain that need. obviously you are free to invest in it, but don't expect it to behave like sound money

8697 2018-04-16 05:25:43 Think you should do some research on GHG emissions to start,  Alberta oil isn't as dirty as coal.  Three times the GHG emissions come from engine fuel combustion than come from oil production.  My family and friends in Ont don't hate AB.  Think it's just you?

8724 2018-04-16 05:20:41 Trudeau is a Marxist and he is using this to Nationalize the oil industry.
8725 2018-04-16 05:20:28 Micro plastics. Offshore Oil drilling. Super trawlers. Just a few of the things humans have invented that have changed the world. Stay curious.
8726 2018-04-16 05:19:54 Do you like the Rothschild family directing your fate? If not, pray that Trump stops allowing our nation to be pawns for them. They're already preparing to drill for oil in Syria. Already.
8727 2018-04-16 05:19:52 Yes. Now dah almost 1.20pm my nose and forehead area still no oil yet smooth (not dry).
8728 2018-04-16 05:19:50 applies rosehip oil all over my fucking face
8729 2018-04-16 05:19:43 The US won't. Not as long there's bucks to be made and by that I mean many bucks of course. They were there mainly for the oil, influence and protection of Israel, they won't go.
8730 2018-04-16 05:19:37 You had also indicated inorganic route to double output of oil and gas within two years. Why don't you look at Oil India, HOEL so as consolidate the sector and maximise output which so essential for our country to save on imports.
8731 2018-04-16 05:19:36 Montreal’s mayor blocking east/west pipeline for environmental concerns, yet has no issue spilling raw sewage in the st Lawrence. I should we illegal for any province to buy foreign oil.

8735 2018-04-16 05:18:58 I think the issue is: are there options which make it less damaging and there are.  It's just that pipeline industry is stuck in a rut & can't even think of anything else.  Then there's the climate change thingy.  Oil industry has destroyed many industries over last 75 years

8738 2018-04-16 05:18:07 Also that "illegal" plant, in the shape of oil, can help to restore your natural synopsis and disrupt the effects of this madness. Let us put in motion solutions which can really help us, instead of just talking. That is why it is illegal while alcohol remains very legal.
8739 2018-04-16 05:18:01 No, it recalls that the conversation is broader than one single Twitter thread.

How would you characterize this one pipeline's significance, then, if two governments are looking at buying in? What does that say about the argument that the oil will just move another way?

8742 2018-04-16 05:17:07 Capitalism leveraged cheap oil into sharp growth. A lot of unwanted babies were born. Now they are adults, restless, unemployed, homeless, or poorly paid. Cheap oil is gone, and what remains in the ground is collateral on debt.

And still, Jasper has suffered no ill effects. So obviously an oil spill isn't the end of the world, as you'd have everyone believe.
8750 2018-04-16 05:16:10 Indeed Syria oil resources are tiny, mostly for internal consumption.
8751 2018-04-16 05:16:05 Actually I have clear lip gloss  and I love it but I don’t drown my poor lips in it like some vegetable oil on a frying pan  you don’t either so the message was pertaining to ya

8765 2018-04-16 05:13:35 FYI The oil companies and the pipeline companies don’t “burn” the oil. The end user does - You and I. Why is it the “dirtiest oil” in the world?  You don’t know and its not.

2. Need support to continue conflict, so provide supplies to militias,  3. To get UN support they create false flag chem attacks via militias, a similar attack in UK too.

8868 2018-04-16 04:56:37 It’s a strange mix of things going onin Syria. In the middle is the all important oil and even more so a pipeline.  The situation has been created and it’s going to be extremely difficult to reverse it now.
8869 2018-04-16 04:56:33 Interesting. Was aware of the NEB application but thought new pipeline allocation rules, growth of US oil production, and 2014 crash made oil by rail to the Burnaby less necessary. Didn't hear that any of that was from the US either.
8870 2018-04-16 04:56:27 ..profoundly aware that the livelihoods of people here depend on resource development. Further, the taxes and royalties collected from oil companies and workers are what help support all the worthy social development projects you are championing.

8872 2018-04-16 04:56:03 you should know that the big players in the OIL SANDS are canadisn companys. You should figure out what is true. If the pipeline doesnt go then i would expect alberta would stop putting money into the transfer funds and do away with the carbon tax as it was to get the pipeline

The question is "how much more emission do we produce when shifting from hydropower to oil/gaz?" (by launching a gaz industry in Quebec, that's what we would do). The answer is self evident: a lot.

9054 2018-04-16 04:24:36 Oil is always going to be used. Fact that too many things use petroleum and they are an environment-friendly in comparison to the alternative. Change to industries is not going to be overnight. Alberta is already switching coal to greener jobs.

9059 2018-04-16 04:23:50 LOL. We will be fine, however, you will be still sucking MID EAST oil. BYE!!!
9060 2018-04-16 04:23:46 The oil has to come from somewhere and pipelines are much safer then rail roads, and makes more sense financially to get oil from Canada instead of having to buy it. I agree there has to be much more penalties for any kind of a soil. Big oil needs to be held accountable
9061 2018-04-16 04:23:35 The main contention is an oil pipeline going to EU from Suadi via Syria and Turkey. And Russia wants to stop it to maintain an oil monopoly to EU, US and EU don't want to give Russia any leverage.
9062 2018-04-16 04:23:34 Comey is as greasy as they come, every time he speaks, you can see the oil running down his face
9063 2018-04-16 04:23:25 Pipelines to the US are a very poor financial option for Canada.  Lets all work together for a prosperous  Canada and stop suuporting other third world countries by buying their oil.

9124 2018-04-16 04:12:30 So does oil. And the risk is huge to other industries such as tourism and fisheries. Most of the oil production is being automated away so it will only create 50 permanent jobs. Most of the money will go to these rich oil company executives. Why are we fighting each other?
9125 2018-04-16 04:12:30 Not against oil...there is a need...but to hint that it is all "hippy" is being an ass...we are "concerned" ass that it is not your clean up....it is ours and the feds...are they prepared??? Will you give shit???? Or is it our problem???
9126 2018-04-16 04:12:08 I assume you mean oil patch workers when you say unemployed people. That is why instead of investing money in fossil fuels there should be money invested in training those workers for jobs in the renewable energy sector.

9167 2018-04-16 04:06:11 From my understanding the oilsands and PertoCanada were created under similar circumstances when private industry pulled out of Fort Mac. And Government investment created the major oil production engine we have today. So I would say it worked out pretty well.

9185 2018-04-16 04:03:50 Question for @jjhorgan & @AJWVictoriaBC: is Canada ceding the oil marketplace to jurisdictions with less enviro, ethical & democratic standards a good thing? #bcpoli #abpoli @ableg #cdnpoli

9187 2018-04-16 04:03:31 That’s a awesome point and as far as a new pipeline being a environmental problem people like eclipse are so off the mark I think these people should realize how much oil is being shipped already by existing pipelines and rail cars with no environmental disasters

9196 2018-04-16 04:00:53 Anyone who brings up oil or natural gas pipelines through Syria as a reason for what is going on needs to: 
1- Realize they are insulting the honorable people of Syria who rose against a tyrant and ask for freedom
2- Read about the history of the pipelines in the region

9198 2018-04-16 04:00:29 @POTUS It is happening. Due to my age, I have noticed over the decades that every time Americans get a little ahead from wage increases or tax cuts, the price of gasoline within the following year increases to gobble up what extra money we have gained. Oil companies are too big.
9199 2018-04-16 04:00:03 @elonmusk 6. The priest must also take the frankincense oil and with his holy cloth rub the entrace to the door way side to side top to bottom. Get you some incense to burn and have your priest bless the room offer up a prayer and take his holy oil and bless you

9201 2018-04-16 04:00:02 I always see posts about how no affordable foods are healthy, but that just isn't true. Staples are affordable, like: rice, beans, lentils, corn, peas, carrots, eggs, oatmeal, peanut butter, apples, bananas, spinach, pasta, olive oil, onions, shallots, potatos, and more.
9202 2018-04-16 03:59:52 There will be a spill along the trans mountain pipeline, perhaps in the inlet. We are merely negotiating the compensation. Could we use the money for a new idea? The pipeline idea is 50+ years old. Will it age well? If oil goes to $40 will it seem wise? Let’s be leaders. #yvr #BC

9216 2018-04-16 03:57:12 Lac Megantic would be a huge disincentive to oil, I think. Not to mention that without pipeline it would be far more likely that many parts of Canada will get Saudi oil due to transport difficulties.  I'd rather Cdn oil. I do think there shld be strict environmental oversight tho

9219 2018-04-16 03:57:02 You can use it for half a year then. Better than using oil and gas for the entire year.
9220 2018-04-16 03:56:59 Stop Oil. Think of the marine mammals and sea-life. People have to go 1&2, what do we do with it? Dilute it and send it out to sea. Hypocrisy is astounding.
9221 2018-04-16 03:56:45 do some energy projects that aren't oil then.
9222 2018-04-16 03:56:35 I spent the whole weekend at my boyfriends, so when I got home I did a deep condition, took my vitamins and biotin, charcoal mask, and used charcoal on my teeth, did my whole skin routine and put castor oil on my brows & lashes. I feel a whole lot better, shit lol

9226 2018-04-16 03:55:31 Many of us in BC think the pipeline is safe than other means of transporting oil. We want it built.
9227 2018-04-16 03:55:22 All of these stations are built beside... wait for it... ROADS!!!  I don’t give a fuck what your car is powered by.  Unless it flys - it uses huge amounts of oil for its driving surface and tires.

9235 2018-04-16 03:52:38 The world’s economy has changed to address climate change. Oil will never be $100/barrel again. Canada needs to adapt to this new reality. More corporate welfare to Big Oil co.s in Texas is NOT the answer.

Where is the oil really going? Will it affect BC economy pos? Neg? Neut? Is it really just beneficial to KM shareholders?

9278 2018-04-16 03:46:21 That is the point,  we have to be weaned off oil sooner or later.. sooner  might reduce climate change damage. Later might offer some "good" jobs but not for long.

9316 2018-04-16 03:40:53 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

9319 2018-04-16 03:40:38 More oil filled pipelines will increase environmental debt.  We are brilliant enough to repay monetary and environmental debt, if time allows.  Why would I allow dirty oil to further mortgage our lives?  Premier John Horgan is correct and brave.

9334 2018-04-16 03:38:49 You are right In Daniel Yergin Book he has described the situation of non stop oil transport even during dangerous WW2 times oil never stops due to the fact that oil is so essential stopping oil means stopping the movement of a country.

9341 2018-04-16 03:37:49 Susan, the 0.5% sulfur emissions limit is a huge deal, but it was passed 18-months ago.  3 million barrels/day of residual fuel oil will suddenly be unneeded on Jan 1, 2020, and 3 million barrels/day of distillate fuel similar to diesel will be instantly needed instead.  SHOCK!!!

I use a tea tree oil face wash from the body shop, witchhazel/rose water/tea tree oil toner, shea butter for moisturizer twice a day. I exfoliate twice a week & one mask a week and there’s been a significant difference. Never use my hands, clean rag replaced weekly.
9358 2018-04-16 03:35:14 No, because the oil price is increasing in the US (from the previous price drop after Irak). There. The rest is just bullshit. #justsaying

On what cost?
Agricultural land being wasted by plastic, concrete, oil for intermittent electricity production with fossil fuel for backup generators.
Infrasound pollution too.

9374 2018-04-16 03:33:04 Lots of different stuff, haven’t tried baking in it tho(seems weird to do that) basically they’re a v small convection oven. U use tiny amounts of cooking oil and it tastes the same to me. Downside is it takes much longer to cook stuff than normal frying & capacity of the basket
9375 2018-04-16 03:32:53 Funny thing is, everyone raving on YouTube still uses oil anyway, just not as much. Haha
9376 2018-04-16 03:32:52 Wallace. I wasn't even referring to that pic, which may actually be caustic soda/chlorine train based upon age of rail cars. And yep, I clearly know difference between BNSF oil tanker trains & BNSF coal trains (from US Powder River Basin) heading to Roberts Bank Superport. ;)
9377 2018-04-16 03:32:51 @JustinTrudeau a lesson in why pipelines hurt Canadians at the pump: from 1980-present, oil production has more than doubled. 

Canadian refinery capacity is lower now than it was in 1979. Derp.

9381 2018-04-16 03:32:34 It's KM's money (or it should be!). We'll still be shipping tons via pipe and rail if it's not built. Does that really speed up better newer tech and industry? We're still buying oil from other places indefinitely. I want real numbers, & where is the oil really going?
9382 2018-04-16 03:32:27 Read up on Genie gas and oil. Pipelines that they want to run through Syria.

9384 2018-04-16 03:32:09 Can you explain the "winning a war" part? As a BC resident, the Kinder Morgan pipeline, and particularly the storage of oil, would make me feel unsafe. I don't get why the rest of Canada doesn't get that. It isn't flaky "BC protestors." I don't know anyone who wants it.
9385 2018-04-16 03:32:04 Another stat for you, did you know the median income in horrible Alberta, because of those horrible oil companies is $20’000 a year higher than in BC, even though it costs more to live in BC?
9386 2018-04-16 03:31:36 I can't wait til the day this selfish, conceded bitch is never in my life again. She's gonna reap what she sews. I wonder how the drug court would feel to know she's doing cbd oil meanwhile hitting other peoples car and taking off and not dealing with it.

Read up on Genie gas and oil. This is about gas pipelines, not poor dead children.

9408 2018-04-16 03:28:42 Maybe Kinder Morgan got out of the bitumen pipeline biz because of oil price forecast. Maybe mining tar sands doesn’t make $ sense. #abpoli

9411 2018-04-16 03:28:01 Bureaucrats already have decided. Oil and gas to be phased out. Pipeline not happening. AB is to be brought to its knees. Oil and gas to be sacrificed at climate change altar. AB can't manufacture by confederation rules. Only agricultue going fwd.Wind. 
SEPARATE
9412 2018-04-16 03:27:57 I agree with everything else but PATCHOULI OIL SMELLS GOOD SMH
9413 2018-04-16 03:27:53 Trudeau environnement/economic policies are ridiculous.  His carbon tax to offset new oil sand and pipeline projects is like financing cancer research with a tax on tobacco.  I’m not proud of where Canada is heading.
9414 2018-04-16 03:27:52 Better get the fu*k outta there before this shit blows up in our faces. Read up on the gas pipelines that companies like Genie oil and gas want to run through Syria. All about money, not dead children.
9415 2018-04-16 03:27:48 the one I got was supposedly intended for that too!! just as long as it’s 100% pure castor oil 
9416 2018-04-16 03:27:44 Then that is KM and Alberta's problem and BC would have less oil transportation to worry about. I'm mostly worried about the interests of FNs and whether a spill is really more likely by rail than pipe. And I live a block from Stanley Park...

9433 2018-04-16 03:25:58 Alberta wants to legislate cutting off BC oil, I say @jjhorgan should look into cutting off Hydro.  This "tit for tat" is ridiculous!  See if the NWT wants to run a pipeline north.
9434 2018-04-16 03:25:54 Pero nakakatamad kasi sobrang init!  Change oil pa. Haist talaga
9435 2018-04-16 03:25:48 Yep - wake up ! Hint: this is the only place the world where this is happening....stealing us blind for US profit on our own oil. Our heavy crude is great for gas, US light could no good for gas - figure it out!
9436 2018-04-16 03:25:48 Look, I’m not the biggest fan of the oil sands and pipelines, but collectively, until our dependence on mined resources diminishes, we have to look at continually developing those resources in a responsible way.
9437 2018-04-16 03:25:09 I’m with you on 90% percent of actions, but I can’t understand why you would bomb a country that is fighting ISIS, I heard it has something to do with Israel influencing you, and oil and gas! Is this correct???

9453 2018-04-16 03:22:25 Why did we not intervene when Sudan used chemicals weapons in 2016? why do only comdenm countries with Gas and Oil? Again why not bomb Sudan for using chemicals weapons against it's own people in 2016? WAKE UP Ian.
9454 2018-04-16 03:22:24 Alberta has the dirtiest oil in the world. You are the uninformed one. Coal is bad yes but oil pipelines spill and that would be a huge disaster.

9464 2018-04-16 03:21:36 Usually I pan-sear them with olive oil and crushed garlic, but today I just peeled the leaves apart and used them like lettuce.  Once the leaves were peeled, I tossed them with balsamic vinegar and olive oil, and added diced Roma tomatoes and canned salmon.

9473 2018-04-16 03:20:09 "Commies" - *eyeroll*

Because the massive drop in oil prices had nothing to do with it.

We've been here before. See 1986.

Booms like we were in are simply unsustainable.

9483 2018-04-16 03:18:35 Move to America then. We get to choose our own path and if we chose to be different that is our prerogative.

9486 2018-04-16 03:18:27 If that’s what you truly believe then the government of BC should be invested in the construction of a oil refinery in Kitimat so we’d be shipping light crude rather than diluted bitumen.

9488 2018-04-16 03:18:25 Yes. Sure there are problems but we can work on them. The Kenney is all about division. Lowest common denominator stuff.  Some folks who want AB to separate from Canada but this won't get the oil to tidewater. @jkenney @RachelNotley @jjhorgan Failed politicians = the problem.
9489 2018-04-16 03:18:16 There are several news items and articles today talking about a drop in oil prices on Monday because the attack on targets in Syria was limited. 

The decline is only 70-80 cents folks! Give me a break! 

There was no political premium in oil prices because of Syria to speak of..

9497 2018-04-16 03:16:14 I like @nikkihaley - she's done some good work, but she needs to be reminded of history (not so distant history, tbh).  Syria mostly about the oil pipeline and who controls it.  That's what it is about.  We do have Nat.Sec. interests there related to that, but no one will admit.

9521 2018-04-16 03:12:44 This is waste of money. I am also amazed how people hate oil, but it is ok for more container traffic to flow through both Prince Rupert and Vancouver, right?

9522 2018-04-16 03:12:15 What's Your GO TO Essential Oil?
9523 2018-04-16 03:12:04 By keeping the demand for oil high and by not encouraging people to switch to renewable energy, you encourage countries to keep extracting the product.

9533 2018-04-16 03:10:39 Which union? The idea oil can be refined in Alberta then sold to other countries has already been debunked. It is cheaper to refine elsewhere due to lower wages. Plus they can decide what they want, anything from grease to jet fuel.

9586 2018-04-16 03:03:45 Pity it doesn't open your eyes to the truth: that trump is not morally fit to lead this country, no matter how many evangelicals he surrounds himself with. He is an adulterous liar with no moral compass, but he's always been an excellent snake oil salesman.
9587 2018-04-16 03:03:28 Or to raise the price of oil.
9588 2018-04-16 03:03:11 Investing in oil production infrastructure today is equally smart as investing in newspaper printing presses in early 2000’s
9589 2018-04-16 03:02:48 Use coconut oil, turmeric and kala namek (black sea salt) and it’ll taste and look like egg
9590 2018-04-16 03:02:44 Are any of you sick? You should call for the elders of the church to come and pray over you, anointing you with oil in the name of the Lord.
9591 2018-04-16 03:02:33 i had a drag show fantasy in my room and used my blanket as a gown which i tore away to reveal a glitter bodysuit but i ended up knocking over my oil diffuser n now my floor is wet

モクセイ科、果実。炎症の緩和鎮静、体の疲れや美容にも。クセがあるのでメインのオイルに5-20%の割合で加えると使いやすい。
使い心地は粘性が高く重い。酸化しにくい。浸透力 は優れている。

9599 2018-04-16 03:01:09 Btw coconut oil? The answer
9600 2018-04-16 03:01:06 Depende. Si es rubio tenes que usar shampoo azul para mantener el color lindo o se te pone amarillo feo. Shampoo de keratina y aceite de argan cuando me lo cepillo. La marca Moroccan Oil es de las mejores marcas del súper.

9605 2018-04-16 03:00:29 Money. It's why hemp & cannabis were made illegal in the first place. Forest, cotton & oil industry we're going to lose $ especially cotton as hemp is a Superior product. Since then other Industries have jumped on board because they don't want to lose money, like alcohol industry
9606 2018-04-16 03:00:12 NOOO BABY OIL!!!! 
9607 2018-04-16 02:59:51 But this charcoal on my teeth and this castor oil on my eyelashes  bihhhh you can’t tell me nun
9608 2018-04-16 02:59:32 Pro-pipeline politicians and big oil are desperate to pressure @jjhorgan to back down on #KinderMorgan. Show your support for bold action to protect BC's coast
9609 2018-04-16 02:59:28 *** note: 
keep butter/oil refrigerated. It will go bad if it gets left out (mold).
9610 2018-04-16 02:59:27 I put oil in my room tbh.
9611 2018-04-16 02:59:27 It's almost like all the wars were to curb oil competition but... That would make us... Fascists? Who knew?
9612 2018-04-16 02:59:27 Oil change, 2 tires, before school but I needsssss to be in the nailshop frfr
9613 2018-04-16 02:59:25 Hash oil? Oh high oil for a second I thought you could see what I am currently doing.
9614 2018-04-16 02:59:20 I sort of wish that I drank the foul and miserable oil that they call coffee at @Starbucks, so that I could boycott them. Alas, my taste buds forced me to boycott them long ago.
9615 2018-04-16 02:59:18 Gonna start a restaurant called Secretly Mediterranean that’s deli meats and Ukrainian diner staples but spiked with squid ink and grassy deep green olive oil and wrapped lovingly in grilled octopus tentacles.
9616 2018-04-16 02:59:05 @CrimeWritersOn I'm late catching up on old episodes, but #2 home heating oil in a general sense is the same as diesel, they usually add a dye to heating oil so it can't be used for trucks.
9617 2018-04-16 02:59:03 the americans sold germany a ton of oil during the early stages of the war, so much so that the brit had to sink texaco's carriers

9624 2018-04-16 02:58:14 Then put your big boy pants on and get the pipeline through! Stop cowtowing to the special interest groups funded by US oil interests!

9631 2018-04-16 02:57:25 Just made some Divine coconut oil based Mayo. The potato salad is off the hook and very few P U F A's
9632 2018-04-16 02:57:24 No ma'am. I'm not a dabber though. My vape pen uses oil and I use edibles when I'm at work.
9633 2018-04-16 02:57:22 Sorry. Uhmm SOBH by Jeff Garvin. WWBU by Daniel Handler. haha the latter is . Will remind you of your own break up. 
9634 2018-04-16 02:57:20 @cbdoilhub I filed a federal lawsuit to legalize cannabis under Freedom of Religion for making the Holy oil. It started as a CBD oil lawsuit, Paddock v. Gov. Butch Otter, and grew from there to include cannabis buds. Jesus commanded his disciples to give it to the sick so I do.

9637 2018-04-16 02:56:49 The dollar only exists coz it’s backed by guns and oil.  No one trusts the fed to get interest rates right everytime.  Bitcoin is a bet against weak institutions, corrupt governments and currencies all over the world.  It is a crisis currency
9638 2018-04-16 02:56:45 Did you know the #oil Cleansing Method with Organic Cold Pressed Oils like Rosehip & Jojoba  found in #nature can be used to as Makeup Remover for Clear & Radiant Skin!
9639 2018-04-16 02:56:42 The Kinder Morgan project is just expanding the capacity of an already existent pipeline that has been operating safely for 60 years. The alternative is shipping oil by rail or highway, which is much more dangerous.
9640 2018-04-16 02:56:30 Okay so my friend recommended me coconut oil on my hair, but idk if I should apply when wet or dry???? #replytweet
9641 2018-04-16 02:56:11 Oil #futures down in Monday/Asia hours trade, but not much of a "sell the bombs/news" reaction (so far) after last week's rally on fear & uncertainty about what US would do in #Syria. Maybe rally was on anticipating revived #Iran sanctions or  (shock) demand? 
#OOTT #oil #crude
9642 2018-04-16 02:55:42 Alberta is not in very good shape. So many people have lost their jobs, not just in the oil/gas. The NDP has destroyed us. As I understand your concerns this project has federal approval. It’s not just good for Alberta but the country as hole
9643 2018-04-16 02:55:38 Lol that Oil ain’t gonna really hit until the middle of the night watch 
9644 2018-04-16 02:55:35 Helps to have only 5.3 Million population on those oil fields...v Sweden’s almost 10 million..
9645 2018-04-16 02:55:34 lol def add a moisturizer! Staples you NEED in your house: coconut oil, tea tree oil and almond oil. I can’t live without those!!! Aloe Vera works wonders for everything too. Just buy one of those big leaves from the supermarket and use the jelly inside for whatever.
9646 2018-04-16 02:55:30 Exactly, you know you were caught lying about where the KM expansion oil is going. I see the same lie all over "but we will have to buy oil from Saudi Arabia if we don't allow expansion" & I just laugh my ass off.

I hope you have a great day & I genuinely mean that.
9647 2018-04-16 02:55:05 Weekly scalp massages with peppermint extract and Jamaican castor oil
9648 2018-04-16 02:54:51 Uhm, they are. An ad hominem against the accuser attack doesn’t really change the fact that our wide spread use of oil and gas is warming the earth. We’d use something different as soon as it’s available and affordable.
9649 2018-04-16 02:54:50 Why did I never think about adding Argan Oil to my skin care routine sooner  #recommend #byebyedryskin
9650 2018-04-16 02:54:46 The capitalists rob the planet, rip it open for oil and gold, and leave us with nothing but labor.
9651 2018-04-16 02:54:45 Well Justin kept unplugging my wall flower and finally set it down upside down and spilled the oil everywhere and I’m severely pissed off
9652 2018-04-16 02:54:41 I’d say it’s the bypass line on the Fetzer valve... going to need some 3 n 1 oil and some gauze pads....
9653 2018-04-16 02:54:14 Dying industry? Nice try. Oil demand is at a record 100 million barrels a day and according to the IEA will not peak until 2040 at 110 mm per day. That's 850 BILLION bbls to be consumed by 2040. Only a fool or a moron would sit on this resource...
9654 2018-04-16 02:54:14 Lots of pollution. Engineer's university research shows that #pipelines have lower #GreenhouseGas emissions compared to #diesel rail . The same oil goes to market by rail if not by pipelines.  @BlanchardSL #yyc
9655 2018-04-16 02:54:12 Trump wants to stop oil dependancy. His money was made in building skyscrapers & such. He destroyed chemical making plants that Assad was using to kill citizens of a different religous sect.
9656 2018-04-16 02:54:11 Kinder doesn’t need Trudeau’s taxpayer money ...just another govt scam ..Fed and Prov to control AB oil
9657 2018-04-16 02:54:09 and castor oil 
9658 2018-04-16 02:54:05 You are welcome. Mom said scented candle or essential oil can also have relaxing effect too!
9659 2018-04-16 02:53:57 But would it enough more to make it worth it?

That I don't know.

That stability and dependability may also add value during times when there is global price shock event not affecting our production.

But I'm not well versed enough in oil economics to know if that's a thing.
9660 2018-04-16 02:53:42 me: *puts coconut oil on my brows for growth*

9663 2018-04-16 02:53:16 Meanwhile, Quebec still holds their hands out for the federal transfer payments thanks to Alberta oil. J’en aí marre! Cest la dose! Ca suffit!
9664 2018-04-16 02:52:46 tea tree oil is magic
9665 2018-04-16 02:52:45 I’ve been putting castor oil on my brows and lashes every night for a week and if I’m not beautiful by next month I swear I’m gonna sue Jesus Christ himself
9666 2018-04-16 02:52:45 I don't need to smoke it. I take it in the Holy oil and the Extreme oil. If you want to see how it heals look at the medical records of a vet that are attached to my federal lawsuit to legalize cannabis for use in the Holy oil. It is required by my faith to give it to the sick
9667 2018-04-16 02:52:38 @realDonaldTrump  Over Population Problem! Lets shorten life by adding addictive ingredients to food, such as poor grade oil, refined sugar and sodium. I just realized that we already add these ingredients to food! Looks like the problem is already being taken care of. Never mind

9674 2018-04-16 02:51:48 Okay then the Tarte stick would be GREAT for that and so would maybelline dewy! Tarte stick is also great blended out with an oil justvfor a little extra radiance if you want it! also NARS luminous would be good for you
9675 2018-04-16 02:51:44 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
9676 2018-04-16 02:51:30 Shrink acne by placing a wrapped ice cube on it and leave it on the pimple for 3 minutes. Then cover it with a dab of lavender oil.
9677 2018-04-16 02:51:24 I love tea tree oil 
9678 2018-04-16 02:51:10 HOWEVER it does have mineral oil in it but the Resveratrol or Purity version of it uses grapeseed and argan oil respectively
9679 2018-04-16 02:51:07 Wait... is there Pharmacuetical grade fish oil?

I use Youngevity's Fish/Plant Oil
9680 2018-04-16 02:51:04 If they don't want it you can't force it you numbskull. FFS could you please stop acting like a little dictator for one second and realize that you can't deliver what you promised to all those oil barons you've been sucking up to...and that's on you...not BC?
9681 2018-04-16 02:50:52 Need to tell the Arabs who ship there oil down the St Lawrence. They’ll spend plenty to shut Quebec down. Then again I bet Morneau has investments in fracking companies.
9682 2018-04-16 02:50:49 Let’s go for it we are getting screwed now by feds and our own provincial government .this may be the only way to get things done Alberts needs to seperate screw Quebec,they do it to us all the time don’t wanna our oil only the money let’s them get there money off shore as eell

9684 2018-04-16 02:50:28 Also the oil refinery to be constructed by Saudi aramco in kakinada is changed to rathnagiri,Maharashtra..so that he can claim the name telling that the BJP-ruling states are getting every industry

9686 2018-04-16 02:50:18 You mean he will relax his 'principled' stand for the oil industry, but his 'principled' stands against women's rights are as inflexible as the lake of fire is hot..

We know where we need to go.

But how do we get there while doing as little damage as possible to Canadians whose livelihoods currently (and for the foreseeable future will) depend on each of a) a safe environment and b) working in the oil sector?

9706 2018-04-16 02:48:07 No, oil industry execs make those decisions. Q gets their oil mostly from US suppliers anyway.

Nfld could supply eastern Canada but they ship to the US instead. It's all about profit.
9707 2018-04-16 02:47:57 Oh thank god if this is a thing. Aside from eco reasons. I’m deathly allergic and almost every food has palm oil now.
9708 2018-04-16 02:47:52 Because we have built our whole world with it and up until the climate change narrative which I think is the biggest and best run scam ever created, driven by our addiction to social media and communication, oil still remains an essential to quality life.
9709 2018-04-16 02:47:44 NP has been transitioning away from oil and gas for over a decade and they are damn lucky that new drilling technology has extended the life of Maui. Pity Maui competitors, another 20 years of Maui gas from assets  long written off, $$$$.

No, I'm not interested in tickling your clitoris with my facial hair. 
Yes, my beard is sufficiently moisturised. Shea Moisture and black castor oil work fine. Your vaginal juices are a kind gesture, but a hard pass.
9716 2018-04-16 02:45:58  yep, & it is so apparent these days you fight for Goldman Sachs & The modern day Standard Oil.  Stop making Nationalistic excuses.

9720 2018-04-16 02:45:22 Feedback:
- Justification of large projects based on the jobs they will preserve &/or create seems inherently short-sighted & defensive.
- While oil pipeline projects may be an econ imperative, visionary leadership demands equal attn be paid to the future of the energy landscape.

9724 2018-04-16 02:45:00 This Oil War leading world to a not so good direction. For some benefits thru oil prices few super powers playing this dirty game.
9725 2018-04-16 02:44:53 Don’t forget cleaning up the USVI’s...then oil spills patrol and clean up in the gulf...
9726 2018-04-16 02:44:52 He said, "it would be an awesome curl, a few gnarly bumps, with some righteous pitch for the dudes - what, its an OIL pipeline?"
9727 2018-04-16 02:44:50 Also there's a hell of a lot of oil in Syria.
9728 2018-04-16 02:44:46 If the ETH devs (@VitalikButerin) is going for the Oil/Gas use case, wouldn't a "finite supply" be a show stopper? Who wants to use a fuel that's going to run out.
9729 2018-04-16 02:44:41 I use a skincare routine called reverse and it’s literally reversed all of my skin damage! It’s like I have been taking care of my skin for the last 10 years and not laying out in then sun rubbed in oil lol

9739 2018-04-16 02:43:07 Let’s remember, this had absolutely nothing to do with existing oil business and so you certainly aren’t starving! This is about increasing existing production so you can get richer, selling a lot more oil (7 times more) to Asia...at BC’s coastal risk!

9741 2018-04-16 02:42:41 I'm sorry but there is nothing of the scale of the oil sands in BC I could possibly compare it to. BC is far healthier in that regard. That is the point of the tweet.
9742 2018-04-16 02:42:40 a back rub from a sweet food that smells like coconut oil would be much appreciated

9785 2018-04-16 02:37:17 When I redid my kitchen a few yrs ago, we found an old @edmontonjournal in the walls from 1951. The most prevalent news @ the time included unseasonal weather & oil. ...There really ain't nuthin' new under the sun. #yegwx #abpoli

That's an odd form of "debunked"
9808 2018-04-16 02:34:10 Nothing has changed for Canadian scientists nor re: democratic improvement. JT has expanded environmental regulation to the pt. where no new oil development will ever be built and has scared off business investment to the lowest point in decades.

9820 2018-04-16 02:33:08 58% of petrol is refined in NZ and the rest imported. Apart from some local light oil/condensate, all crude is also imported. So a transition to alternatives is important, ask Muldoon!
9821 2018-04-16 02:33:04 "Much of that 300 percent net worth gain came from his wife, Janna Ryan, who inherited a blind trust worth between $1 and $5 million and owns interest in an array of oil and gas, mineral and timber leases."

9833 2018-04-16 02:32:17 Called Meijer to see what type of oil filter wrenches they had in stock. I spoke to 2 people in the tool dept, and 2 people in the automotive dept and none of them knew what an oil filter wrench was
9834 2018-04-16 02:32:13 So your link is to a news report, the second paragraph of which is:
Ministers announced earlier in the month that the controversial method of oil and gas extraction "cannot and will not take place in Scotland".
Note the report says earlier, ie before.
Hope that helps.
9835 2018-04-16 02:31:56 Again..so what? What has that have to do with what you’re planning here and that’s turning Metro Vancouver into a major oil shipping port from what it is today. Something that will no doubt result in marine incidents, oil spills and oil spills so long as this activity is allowed.
9836 2018-04-16 02:31:45 FYI, cancer feeds off of sugar. Cut out all sugar and watch patients resound to treatment with a higher success rate. And legalize medical cannabis oil for medical since science and antidotal evidence proves higher success of cancer going into remission
9837 2018-04-16 02:31:29 As far as products in particular.. you always want shampoo, conditioner, leave in conditioner, oil of your choice & a cream based product of your choice.. anything else you wanna use (like a gel or eco styler) is just gonna enhance whatever style you wanna do

9855 2018-04-16 02:28:57 It’s a fact. Atiku has absolutely nothing to contribute. He set up his private university from the money he stole, including the Malibu oil deal, the Halliburton corruption and bribery scandal. We can unleash more dossiers on him.

9860 2018-04-16 02:28:39 Lately I been sipping oil a lot
9861 2018-04-16 02:28:27 Oil is priced in U.S. dollars. The dollar is the worlds reserve currency. It's why we can spend trillions and not become the Banana Republic. The reason we're in the ME is to maintain the dollar status quo. All the wars of the last 40 years in the ME is because of the above.
9862 2018-04-16 02:28:25 Gregory the Seer, please grace us when Oil will be at $90 you seem to know so much.....
9863 2018-04-16 02:28:17 Reducing Ethereum to simply an "oil" for computations doesn't limit its capability to be a widely accepted currency. Past monies have had other uses, re: the barley standard. Barley wasn't sustainable bc it literally perishes, but history tends to repeat itself.
9864 2018-04-16 02:27:56 Cocoanut oil and I go hand and hand!
9865 2018-04-16 02:27:47 I had them for the first year I had my nose pierced. Crushed up aspirin with water will get rid of them or diluted tea tree oil! Got rid of them for good. It works on my ears too
9866 2018-04-16 02:27:36 Taking fish oil to grow my hair but also hoping I grow gills in the process
9867 2018-04-16 02:27:26 JUAL HIGH PERFORMANCE MOTORCYCLE OIL
SMS/LINE 081257336645
9868 2018-04-16 02:27:09 Glen brought tuna in water instead of in oil and it taste soooo different
9869 2018-04-16 02:26:59 Hahahaha  dump oil now moron
9870 2018-04-16 02:26:35 I get that you didn't like my response to the breeding statement. What does using the web have to do anything? I wanted to know why you gave me that response to my response.
9871 2018-04-16 02:26:22 if Putin is part of the
Military & Oil Industrial Complex
this won't lead to WW3,
we might see $100 barrels of Oil tho
even tho there is a glut.
9872 2018-04-16 02:26:10 Definitely oil, boil and foil, no urls
9873 2018-04-16 02:26:07 Listen bitches. Money is money. If it has a tiny tear in it, has been stained a little by motor oil, or whatever the circumstance is. Don’t check my 10 dollar bill and then tell me you can’t take it because it’s dirty. Fuck you. #moneyismoney
9874 2018-04-16 02:25:42 The holy quadrant: castor oil, coconut oil , olive oil , grasped oil. They fix anything from hair to skin
9875 2018-04-16 02:25:18 Don't forget, it's all about the oil. #SyriaStrikes #gameofthones
9876 2018-04-16 02:25:11 You know they say coconut oil can fix everything but castor oil has some magical qualities
9877 2018-04-16 02:24:52 Sorry that we haven't been speedy for you. We do include a lot in our oil changes, like tire rotation. So, they can take a little longer than a quick lube place. We'd love to connect. DM us.
9878 2018-04-16 02:24:51 So I thought I was having a marginally ok evening, until I went to open my bottle of wine and was in fact opening a bottle of olive oil. That's the kind of tragic magic night I'm closing Sunday out with. Pinot Grigioil it is.
9879 2018-04-16 02:24:44 Looks like they're crossing the Euphrates to take over Syria's eastern oil fields.
9880 2018-04-16 02:24:36 OR SIRIUS 114
9881 2018-04-16 02:24:21 I’m convinced Scott Pruitt gets off to pictures of oil spills and melting ice caps

9883 2018-04-16 02:24:11 I suppose I am to assume from your response that you are unsure of how solar energy works. Does that also include wind energy? How about geothermal? The government is pro oil for the money. Why are you pro oil?
9884 2018-04-16 02:23:48 Syria has much oil but it never copability to take it out..
9885 2018-04-16 02:23:36 I'm getting payback for that last tweet.  Rubbed jalapeno oil in my eyes
9886 2018-04-16 02:23:34 Greg convinced me to get clove essential oil and fuckkkkk 
9887 2018-04-16 02:23:33 Idk what's funnier this one or the video of the lady who put motor oil on hers 
9888 2018-04-16 02:23:15 The article cited says we cant grow enough trees to meet paris accord. This means because trees start small they cant accomodate that amount quickly. My point is yes currently we produce more than we can remediate so we should prioritize keeping oil in env concious countries
9889 2018-04-16 02:22:48 I put too much peppermint essential oil in my diffuser and now it smells like a candy cane factory in here
9890 2018-04-16 02:22:40 My best advice would be to apply vitamin c cream & do a oatmeal-honey mask to exfoliate. Try NOT to use any cleansers esp if they have alcohol bc it’ll dry it more. Switch ur lotion for olive oil at night bc some moisturisers can be drying.
9891 2018-04-16 02:22:32 そーです！！
9892 2018-04-16 02:22:13 This nigga hit my truck today.. he boutta pay for everything thts ever been wrong with it.. he hit it frm the back & gon be confused when he payin’ for this battery & oil change
9893 2018-04-16 02:22:12 I love how he says he wants all those who criticize him from past administrations to buy his book and go with him on the journey... or something to that effect. Snake oil salesman.
9894 2018-04-16 02:22:12 coconut oil body rub, facemasks, & insense. so theraputic, get into it
9895 2018-04-16 02:22:11 So excited for Oil Camp 1: 2018! My team is joining in and they are going to have a blast learning about essential oils!
9896 2018-04-16 02:21:45 Hmm. Was there no stores in this place? If that was olive oil, there should be, so why even resort to eating people? We're not delicious, from what I've read.
9897 2018-04-16 02:21:36 The pipeline splits between Chilliwack and Abbotsford, where the line goes south to US refineries. Your Province is already heavily polluted, build some refineries and refine some products! Do something other than oil! Remember when all we did was lumber?
9898 2018-04-16 02:21:10 The goaltender Interference call when it’s on the actual puck carrier is pure fucking garbage... I thought they were supposed to have fixed that after the McDavid fiasco
9899 2018-04-16 02:21:00 Think you need to read that again. Harper said he wanted to get away from a resource dependant economy and that we should aim to be off oil by 2100. He didn't say he wanted to shut down the oilsands, nor stop producing anytime in the near or distant future.
9900 2018-04-16 02:20:59 Started a face regimen today, bought myself a diffuser w/ my favorite oil to help me sleep better ...slowly transitioning to being a full time adult 
9901 2018-04-16 02:20:58 Girls that can make a relationship with a guy in the oil field work are the real keepers and the hardest to fine. And god blessed me with an angel that can. @Brookemckensi
9902 2018-04-16 02:20:56 Oh wow the oil junkies are in syria now trying to fight war with war what a clever idea @realDonaldTrump real smart guy
9903 2018-04-16 02:20:48 I get my bottle this week and cannot wait to try it! Hoping to decrease some medications with the oil. Which brand do you use, if ya don't mind me asking. I am hoping to be successful enough to gift some bottles to folks.
9904 2018-04-16 02:20:43 Is the KORRES wild rose oil everything it's cracked up to be?
9905 2018-04-16 02:20:38 No  jobs will be lost from stopping oil exploration. The permits in place  will be there for many years to come, along with the jobs and miserly  revenue generated. @NZNationalParty using scare tactics for votes yet again.

9908 2018-04-16 02:20:35 that potent oil
9909 2018-04-16 02:20:31 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
9910 2018-04-16 02:20:25 Get clove essential oil and put it on the teeth that hurt!

9914 2018-04-16 02:20:05 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
9915 2018-04-16 02:19:48 The snowy field feels!
It is necessary to talk about how we will treat oil civilization in future in a world country!
9916 2018-04-16 02:19:45 Lol. Cge. Kibaw nko unsa ako ipa borrow nmu. Hahah just choose bet Symptoms of Being Human or Why We Broke Up. Haha
9917 2018-04-16 02:19:25 don't forget the oil & chocolates
9918 2018-04-16 02:19:24 1. Building a pipeline to benefit Big Oil? "In the national interest". Actual interest of many nations (i.e. First Nations)? Ignored.
#StopKM #UpsideDownWorld #cdnpoli
9919 2018-04-16 02:19:21 If this oil pipeline really is in the national interest, then it needs to be nationalized. If it shouldn't be nationalized, then it doesn't rise to the level of national interest. #cdnpoli
9920 2018-04-16 02:19:10 [拡散希望]調味料&食材botさん繋がりましょう。みんなを揚げたり絡めたり、ギトギトにしてあげます。
9921 2018-04-16 02:19:03 Says the snake oil salesman. Buh-bye!
9922 2018-04-16 02:18:55 Just doused myself in lavender oil because I forgot to take my valerian pills & now I can't sleep :)))))))) Gotta be up at 4am haha :))
9923 2018-04-16 02:18:31 I wanna do a Whadafunk collab with a brewery.
I also wanna collab with a beard oil brand.
9924 2018-04-16 02:18:29 Don’t be ridiculous! Seeing the risk of an oil tanker carrying 650 000 barrels of oil in very close proximity to one of the most densely populated cities in North America isn’t picking and choosing. Pushed by greed, the number of tankers will only increase over time!
9925 2018-04-16 02:18:27 witch hazel and wild growth oil 
9926 2018-04-16 02:18:24 @Tesla looks like Big Oil corporations are mad at Tesla that’s why all these negative stories are coming out #bigoil
9927 2018-04-16 02:18:11 There should be a moratorium on Sabah & Sarawak's oil money on  projects in West Malaysia for 3-5 years and funds diverted to build bridges, supply water, etc. Problem is, this money is used to pay current operational expenses.
9928 2018-04-16 02:18:09 tossed in my tousled heart is this: the earliest morning with the most sacred music, rice and kale and coconut oil, the way it feels to walk in the rain on a medium-cold spring day, the way it feels, the way it feels, and spreading my arms wide again, and i love you.
9929 2018-04-16 02:18:08 Tiger Roll shares up, oil down as Syria fallout seen limited
9930 2018-04-16 02:17:58 GOLAN HEIGHTS aka GENIE OIL  NO money with free energy 
9931 2018-04-16 02:17:46 Has your vet said anything about feeding him fish oil ?  Fish oil gives the immune system a boost.   The less man made drugs I can give mine the better I like it
9932 2018-04-16 02:17:41 I wonder who Quebec will buy oil from when they separate, Alberta or Saudi Arabia?
9933 2018-04-16 02:17:22 So true! There's so much greater anointing on those old songs. May a new era of anointed music be inspired by the fresh oil of the Spirit poured out by Blood and Fire!
9934 2018-04-16 02:17:12 Oil pulling is where it’s @ fam
9935 2018-04-16 02:17:05 @CanadianPM @JustinTrudeau @jimcarr_wpg @cafreeland I don't want my tax dollars going towards funding the trans mountain expansion, Kinder Morgan or big oil.
Fund renewable energy, public schools, reconciliation and healthcare instead.
9936 2018-04-16 02:17:04 At this point I need a permanent bath of coconut oil on my hands to keep them from being dry 
9937 2018-04-16 02:16:48 Apple cider vinegar tea... two tablespoons of the vinegar in a full glass of water, add honey.. will loosen up the mucus. Get some oregano oil pills, take one a day, with food... both natural remedies work way better then medicine.
9938 2018-04-16 02:16:43 Try cbd oil

9940 2018-04-16 02:16:24 Oil pens are sooo clutch. Glad they were invented.
9941 2018-04-16 02:16:18 I wonder if it works better than the canola oil we were using lol my poor hairy husband had to lose some hair today.
9942 2018-04-16 02:16:16 Sometimes people ask me what I want to do with my life. I always tell them the very same thing. 

I want to refuse to go to war when I'm drafted into some bullshit-ass oil feud.
9943 2018-04-16 02:16:11 call for　～を呼び求める、必要とする

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
9944 2018-04-16 02:16:09 Try castor oil, hair oil, yet these voices to be heard.
9945 2018-04-16 02:16:07 I put a ton of cinnamon essential oil in my mist diffuser. Fml. Does anyone have a spare hand for sale? #essentialoils #why #oops #Healing ?
9946 2018-04-16 02:15:57 Apostolic and Prophetic houses releases GREAT GRACE unto all saints not just the leaders.. the key to this flow is to be under or in that house to receive that oil.
9947 2018-04-16 02:15:53 Would that they eliminated marine oil spill risks.
9948 2018-04-16 02:15:42 I need an oil diffuser
9949 2018-04-16 02:15:34 It’s a wellpad for insitu extractraction in the oil sands. It’s how most of it is extracted now
9950 2018-04-16 02:15:32 The amount of money oil producing African countries make yearly is enough to end extreme poverty in Africa, yet many Africans are poor.
9951 2018-04-16 02:15:24 checkout @cade_zube  he's young fucking talent and bro get on the oil pen finally!!!
9952 2018-04-16 02:15:24 Ive sacrificed my firstborn son for an oil change + car wash.
9953 2018-04-16 02:15:23 Time, will depend on how long the Oil lasts, in the 3 oilfields the US have taken over. The US will not be leaving any of that. US base already built on 1. The other 2 have been fortified.
9954 2018-04-16 02:15:22 Once again, you can’t convince the hundreds of thousands of people who come to visit the Lower Mainland, see the beautiful coast, the whales that are never far away, eat fresh local fish, walk around Stanley Park that all this would still look amazing after an Alberta Oil Spill?
9955 2018-04-16 02:15:11 @jefflagerquist please ask the oil analyst why in July 2008 Canadians paid ~$1.35 per litre while crude was nearly $150/barrel. Now, with oil at ~$65 we are paying ~$1.20.......
9956 2018-04-16 02:14:44 We have a few at the shop that still get the long ones put in ( mostly trucks going to the oil fields) but not for city roads
9957 2018-04-16 02:14:37 So I've been trying to get this baby out of me.. I've done squats, walked, had sex, ate spicy food, took evening primrose oil, ate pineapple, and am currently taking a hot bath. If anyone has more suggestions please let me know 
9958 2018-04-16 02:14:24 pake dove nourish oil sama hair mask makarizo deh. bantu banget inii
9959 2018-04-16 02:14:14 A question for Premier Horgan: Did you get to Ottawa by horse and wagon or by flying on a jet?  The disingenuousness of environmentalists he you don't see them stripping from the lives anything that has its origins in oil!
9960 2018-04-16 02:14:10 Incidentally the price of midnight oil has gone up
9961 2018-04-16 02:14:04 宝晶石あとちょっとで1万行くぞ………やったね……
9962 2018-04-16 02:13:54 Alberta has proven that it can grow without new pipeline but that is not the point. The point is you made another statement that was demonstrably untrue. She never said it would "destroy the whole oil industry" which is what you claimed. That was untrue.
9963 2018-04-16 02:13:50 Blood oil that our friends in the oil industry buy and profit from? 

The same people that want to build a pipeline in Canada?
9964 2018-04-16 02:13:44 Blockbuster video was the best way to rent out DVDs too, but they went bankrupt due to streaming video.

Oil is no longer a good investment, because renewable energy and batteries are ready now. No longer an ethical investment because of climate crisis. #StopKM

9967 2018-04-16 02:13:13 “Using the group, Chinese intelligence acquires oil & energy companies & other important assets in countries in Africa, Latin American, Southeast Asia, as well as in the United States. In this way it promotes Chinese national interests...”
9968 2018-04-16 02:13:12 Maybe, BUT. why yours presidents wants the oil from  Middle east?
 Trump, Obama,Clinton,Bush, etc, etc....
9969 2018-04-16 02:12:52 This is very backward thinking. Think of your legacy for your grandchildren.  Oil is being phased out due to its environmental disasters. We need to be progressive and clean this planet up.

9971 2018-04-16 02:12:33 True. However in Russia they are known as oil barons. They pull Putin's strings.
9972 2018-04-16 02:12:06 Every industry provides employment.  I'm sick and tired of treating the oil industry as if its special. It gets special infrastructure and a license to destroy.

There are also very limited jobs associated with this project so yes,  limited public benefit
9973 2018-04-16 02:12:05 share one, as in share one poem? It'd be between Old Country, If They Come For Us, and Oil.
9974 2018-04-16 02:12:02 Cannabis oil is usually made from single-bladed "sugar leaves," which are high in THC and grow in the buds of a marijuana plant.
9975 2018-04-16 02:12:02 What has sewage going into the sea in Victoria have anything whatsoever with your plans to ship oil tankers out of the Westridge Marine Terminal in Burnaby, through Metro Vancouver, the 2nd Narrows, under the Lion’s Gate, Stanley Park, UBC...?
9976 2018-04-16 02:11:47 i switched to Triodos a while back as they are far more ethical than the big banks, who have dodgy investments in stuff like oil / fracking
9977 2018-04-16 02:11:44 照明？
9978 2018-04-16 02:11:39 If are not oil tankers!
9979 2018-04-16 02:11:13 If they call it "Oil", why are we (you and I) so engulfed in calling it "money" and analyzing it in that perspective?
9980 2018-04-16 02:11:01 Exxon Valdez NOT a comparable: drunk captain, not double hulled, no modern NAV system, no pilot on board, remote territory and no tug boats. All these SIX elements not at play in oil tankers to Burnaby. They go there today, you know that? About once a week. Plus far more to WA !
9981 2018-04-16 02:10:59 No, this is not about replacing the current system, this is about expanding it. No ones taking the oil out of the rail cars.
9982 2018-04-16 02:10:48 Alaskans own 35,106 shares of WHITING PETROLEUM CORP, worth $332,103. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in UNITED STATES.

9984 2018-04-16 02:10:12 So I tried a sample of Japanese argan oil treatment on a quarter of my hair today
9985 2018-04-16 02:09:59 Come on Blair, that's what this whole thing is about. Notley and Trudeau both argue the #tarsands can't grow without new pipeline capacity. You say the oil will just move by other means. 

Both of those can't be true at the same time.
9986 2018-04-16 02:09:57 That somewhere else will be blood oil that has no ability to regulate against climate change not to mention the constant human rights violations.

9990 2018-04-16 02:09:39 Thanks Adam. My entry point is almost same as yours, but after this pull back, oil may goes higher to 70 - 80. See so many bullish oil reports, though, I don't trust much..

9994 2018-04-16 02:08:32 It’s over producing when you’re putting Asia’s needs, Kinder Morgan shareholder concerns and Alberta Oil Tax greed with selling oil to Asia over the real concerns of the citizens of BC, who live where you’re planning all this dangerous activity.
9995 2018-04-16 02:08:25 @don_k_gunn roommate and i hadn't filled the oil tank, as you had to buy half a tank, minimum. We half froze, had to use kitchen stove for heat, had pots of water boiling for steam.
9996 2018-04-16 02:08:22 Not at all, this is about degradation of the very thin atmosphere around our planet, oil spills and #climatechange. Oil yes... for now. Tar sands no.

9999 2018-04-16 02:08:10 Kinder Morgan can't afford the true market price of their Transmountain Pipeline because the business model is based off of ignoring Indigenous Rights. @JustinTrudeau just turned the oil company into a welfare bum on our territories while ignoring Indig. Rights. #BCPoli #RezPoli
10000 2018-04-16 02:08:04 I’m with you on that oil short
10001 2018-04-16 02:07:58 Bet your one of the first to whine and complain if the gas prices go up.  We don't want their oil...but gassing children certinely sucks
10002 2018-04-16 02:07:55 helluva an effort from Big Sexy #Colon
10003 2018-04-16 02:07:52 All in defense of the US Petrodollar. Common thread. Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria all refused to sell their oil using the Petrodollar. Look for further demonizing of Russia, Iran and China now that the GOLD BACKED Petro Yuan has been launched. They are not using the petrodollar.
10004 2018-04-16 02:07:43 What about our coastlines after the inevitable bitumen oil spill that WON'T be able to be cleaned up??
10005 2018-04-16 02:07:35 Yes: bitumen is an inorganic chemical product (non biological). Biological waste is called “organic.” That’s basic chemistry. And of course, the amount of plastics in sewage and the effects of algal blooms are bad, but an oil spill is orders of magnitude worse. Have a nice night!
