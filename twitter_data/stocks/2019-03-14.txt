38 2019-03-14 23:40:03 So, apologies for all the @TheBachelorUK tweets over the past week. You can rest assured that I’m done now although a few did unfollow during that period  Back to football, stocks and any other nonsense now......promise!
39 2019-03-14 23:39:57 I did inventory at walmart. the vendors dock their trucks and walmart inventory staff unloads and stocks it into the back room in the "bins".
40 2019-03-14 23:37:18 Um you wouldn’t be able to start an ETF with low float stocks due to liquidity reasons....
41 2019-03-14 23:32:22 maybe if insider trading was eliminated and stocks weren't bought back by corporations to boost the price and give shareholders and execs more money. The system needs to be tossed out and rethought.
42 2019-03-14 23:31:13 Would be a loss for Doncaster East's key position stocks ahead of its 2019 campaign if Sam Rowe links up with the Saints. Great for Rowe to get another opportunity at the highest level though. #EFLDIV1 #AFL

50 2019-03-14 23:24:08 If it’s not advertised, you would not know about it, so you would not buy it. Advertising is used for taking your money in exchange for an item, the question is who gets the better deal? The one advertising or the customer? Same goes with stocks.
51 2019-03-14 23:24:05 @GHGGuru said that CO2 and N20  r "stock" while CH4 is "flow." I got that, but why does @RuaraidhP  say then that CH4  from fossil fuels adds to "stocks?"  0  of my questions concern CO2; they r related to CH4 from leaks in oil/gas distrib system.

57 2019-03-14 23:18:17 He only thinks he's elite. He's a pawn and poverty struck compared to those who control them.

Remember why it's called a pyramid scheme.

All the people they funnel money to funnel money to them. It's pay to play all the way.

I bet all his money is in stocks that will tank.
58 2019-03-14 23:17:21 Same with stock brokerages. The banks were prohibited from selling stocks on a retail basis and the law was changed there as well. 

Whenever the banks were allowed into a market they were previously barred from they took it over.

74 2019-03-14 23:03:57 You're assuming that your assets increase at pace with inflation which isn't guaranteed at all. You can look at houses and stocks right now and find that they fluctuate at various rates. It's a pretty normal for advisors to take this into account when recommending investments.
75 2019-03-14 23:02:54 Did you short their stocks or something? I'm long on a couple of them and would appreciate it if you would stop this bashing campaign of yours.
76 2019-03-14 23:02:52 Went stocktwits y'day and the $CGC board is a circus of egos hoping or even knowing for sure that the stock will explode higher from this 'textbook' triangle. They are so focussed on this stocks they didn't even take note of the red hot market rally around them.

79 2019-03-14 23:01:12 I’ve heard of washing stocks, but now companies are allegedly washing movie tickets. Buy advance tickets for your own movie to drive interest. I really hope it hasn’t got to that point.
80 2019-03-14 23:00:48 I’m pointing out price levels on stocks where the price has the potential to reverse direction. Support & resistance are price areas on a stock chart where supply and demand meet.

85 2019-03-14 22:58:24 My posts about $CGC and $BTC may sound cocky, but the reason I choosed this tone is to make clear that trading isn't about labels or easy trendlines. It is about acting on little clues w/o knowing if they will lead to the next monster stocks or yet another stop loss hit.
86 2019-03-14 22:57:58 I don't know of public sites to screen for stocks but there were a few back in the early 2000's. I suggest buying Stock Investor Pro and you can screen for anything you wish.

89 2019-03-14 22:56:01 Executive order banning bump stocks and saying due process should be foregone to take people's guns away if they are suspected of a crime. Name another president who has said something as anti gun as foregoing due process to take away guns.
90 2019-03-14 22:54:43 I think that debate has been done and dusted over the past five years. Warren Buffet doesn't do PEs, and the likes of $CSL are proving time and again, a premium PE does not equal "dog", "expensive", or "poised for crash". On the contrary, low PE stocks, however... #ausbiz #XJO

93 2019-03-14 22:52:05 Some states have taken measures. House has passed federal legislation. Even bump stocks are no longer. Not enough by any means, but not nothing. Some heroic lawmakers such as Pres Obama & Sen Murphy need congrats for their efforts.

95 2019-03-14 22:48:20 There are errors in the WPSR (and any other data, for that matter), but to assume that unaccounted-for is always and consistently attributable to stocks assumes 1) perfect surveys and estimates outside of storage AND 2) an industry-wide level of fraud on storage reporting. 3/3

134 2019-03-14 22:16:16 Somalia is an perfect example of a country that did not protect it borders , waters became over fished, waters polluted by other nations, domestic animal stocks decimated, lawlessness unabated, annual nation gross income in 2016 was 88 dollars. Anyone could enter their country.
135 2019-03-14 22:15:33 @jimcramer Hey Jim did the Apple stocks just see a jump or what
136 2019-03-14 22:15:12 See if i can't whip something up over the weekend! Thank you <3
137 2019-03-14 22:14:46 Live trading 9am - 12 noon, join me daily we look at stocks such as those that were active today... $ATOS $WAGE $TSG $YOGA $DOMO $DG $TLRD $ADXS $UNIT $VVPR $SEEL $LENS

139 2019-03-14 22:13:02 Ayer probé el Dissidia gratis en Steam y de momento me parece un poco meh, no entiendo por que las peleas consisten en 3 stocks que comparten los 3 personajes a la vez tbh.
140 2019-03-14 22:13:00 I'm travelling today (& #737MAX issue has made it a headache n a half) but I'll squeeze a few words in.
Just take East Coast cod:
-Canada banned from fishing for 26 years... stocks near extinct
-Current Cdn quota ~200,000lbs (ALL SHIPS)
-Current Foreign (Russia, Jpn, etc) 25M lbs
141 2019-03-14 22:12:59 I had a few people ask me about the Tusla fund an Jay Morrison I did not feel comfortable recommending something like that. I don't even like penny stocks why would I like that.
142 2019-03-14 22:12:38 @marketcall What is view on lumber stocks  specifically Westfraser timber? Thanks
143 2019-03-14 22:12:32 CEOs are bullish net stocks.
144 2019-03-14 22:10:42 You think your remaining 3 Roy stocks would’ve beaten my 4 Luigi stocks on Dreamland? 
145 2019-03-14 22:10:34 I like these analyst downgrades in stocks with massive call positioning in leaps... gets us in cheaper :)
146 2019-03-14 22:10:31 Performers are part of the amount that WWE is worth on the stocks. If WWE lost Undertaker, Triple H, All of DX, Hardyz and others during Monday night wars the company value would’ve lost value big time. RR like or not is the face of their product now. Lose him lose value
147 2019-03-14 22:09:16 If you chased today on tech stocks...most likely you got killed.. its important to have a plan and strategy before buying...
148 2019-03-14 22:09:05 Insiders may know something that'll happen. I saw people saying it was bc of NCT, D.O or the kakaotalk chatroom, but it's early to say. JYP has been rising their stocks on the other hand.
149 2019-03-14 22:07:52 For the first time in ten years I decided to actively play stocks and made 8.5% in 6 weeks. Ready to be your stock broker now
150 2019-03-14 22:07:03 @JRWilsonWriting  something for you or??
151 2019-03-14 22:06:18 Going backwards again, I see. Long history of big name analysts at big name shops being big time wrong when making bold calls on growth stocks. This is not new. It isn’t unique or special just because it’s Tesla or because the sell side mothership also has a buy side arm.
152 2019-03-14 22:06:07 "After many years, I've concluded that successful stock selection is 60 to 65% knowing every key fundamental fact about a company and its industry and 35 to 40% understanding chart and market action." - William J. O'Neil

156 2019-03-14 22:05:23 After everything is back to normal everyone started showing love towards equity. Majority of the stocks are 20% higher within a month. 2018 was considered as a bear market? Or just a correction?
157 2019-03-14 22:02:36 It would have played better for the stocks if they had grounded their own planes.
158 2019-03-14 22:02:36 Still had 2 stocks left 
159 2019-03-14 22:00:57 JAJAJAJAJA QUE GRANDE. Al final parte del video fue cierto, le hice 3-0 pero de stocks en una partida xDDD
160 2019-03-14 22:00:25 yep, I overlooked this one too, discovered it last month. They are used even in regular stocks as an additional indicator
161 2019-03-14 22:00:13 Some people invest in individual stocks not just funds
162 2019-03-14 21:59:35 $TSLA is probably one of if not THE MOST visible stocks on every traders radar, and this guy from $GS is sticking his and the firms name on it 20 times a year and he's been wrong the whole time. How could that possibly benefit $GS?
163 2019-03-14 21:57:09 had them long before The Orange Mistake took over. Trump economy? I've had to sell a lot of stocks off to protect my portfolio since President Dumbass took office. "His" economy, like all other POTUS's only serve the elites.
164 2019-03-14 21:57:03 Mickelson is a shady dude. Always involved in some type of scheme. Stocks, gambling and now college admissions. Keep it real Phil.
165 2019-03-14 21:56:06 MBA + journalism = exhaustion

Until you learn that your professor approves your portfolio optimization project on newly issued stocks 
166 2019-03-14 21:55:40 The problem with saying that is Republicans (and some Dems) are deeply steeped in the for-profit health care and big pharma system. It’s all tied to huge profits.

Middleman companies employ many people, and they’re invested in their stocks. This is why the GOP cries ‘socialist!’
167 2019-03-14 21:53:12 Damn I called several stocks that peaked up 30% +, I need to trust myself more...
168 2019-03-14 21:52:27 If you have a platform around the investment community there is no incentive not to lie to pump stocks. It’s worked for the Fed, President, Kudlow, Cramer, Musk, and more. Until we legally hold people accountable, why not make shit up?
169 2019-03-14 21:51:31 If they held a vote in the Commons tomorrow that ran:

“This house agrees that Mark Francois is a smug cunt who should be put in the stocks and have rancid meat and veg thrown at him.”

I suspect a very clear majority could be achieved.
170 2019-03-14 21:49:14 @PLDT_Cares I have applied for a Premium Cordless telset last Feb 14. What do you know...still no job order. I hope your CSRs are just honest in telling me that you don't have stocks. I was told before that it will be delivered within 5 business days. Lo and behold, nada!
171 2019-03-14 21:49:01 That's great to hear. Keep studying Stephanie!
172 2019-03-14 21:48:30 For those looking to get into stocks, rental properties, forex and God forbid, crypto.... don’t (yet). Aim to have at LEAST $50,000 in your bank and some Gold to fight inflation. Don’t touch that money, anything you make after that, invest in XYZ. Life is so much better then.
173 2019-03-14 21:47:40 Economy is spoiled, profits buying back shit piles, r&d innovations limited to impress media and pump stocks. Trump and his hoards lie and spreading crap all around the world, what's worse the world drifted
174 2019-03-14 21:46:36 Good analysis.

The Canadian LPs are in a massive valuation bubble. Likely to be popped soon given the horrible sales numbers. I think these stocks will fall 50-70% once the retail herd starts to flee.
175 2019-03-14 21:45:49 Bump stocks...oh wait. rubber bands or belt loops it is.
176 2019-03-14 21:45:09 Haha we arent laughing stocks. I am in the US and a guy legit asked me , i hope you guys are Indians and not Pakistanis lmao. I know of 7 shopkeepers who call their shops Indian groceries and are Pakis, too embarrassed your people are. They say India if we ask where are you from
177 2019-03-14 21:43:20 We are you not pushing for a lawsuit on the banning of bump stocks.
178 2019-03-14 21:42:49 The Yellowstone caldron is set to have another catastrophic volcanic event sometime yet millions visit the area.
179 2019-03-14 21:42:13 Give away most of it to the Make a wish foundation and give some to minimal wage workers then the rest into buying stocks, money like that can ruin a family.
180 2019-03-14 21:39:02 The same can be said for those who do manipulation artwork, the vast majority of the design community does not pay for stocks, therefore, almost all of the "ad" artwork is stolen work
181 2019-03-14 21:38:49 I think Zion is empowered now. Look at the prices of game tix when he plays or Nike stocks price after his injury. He'll still go number 1 if he sits out the season. Playing in College without pay portend more risk/danger.
182 2019-03-14 21:38:30 Going back to 12/18, I asked several friends who worked for $FB about their own FB stocks. All of them told me they sold at 120+. At that time, I can feel their little confidence in the stocks and company, even the US economy. @jimcramer @FUTURENEWS2020
183 2019-03-14 21:37:17 Hi Jordan, any experience with QuantConnect? I am doing some research to create a list of not correlated stocks, my idea is that it could be useful for a portfolio creation

192 2019-03-14 21:33:00 A way to reverse part of this harm is using the revolver funds to repurchase stocks. Despite my disappointment I don't think $HEAR is going much lower than $14, shorts will need to cover their positions in the next few days.
193 2019-03-14 21:32:42 Hope your right Harry, seems like nothing is bad for stocks at the mo, they are ignoring the “real” world around them.
194 2019-03-14 21:32:38 WWE stocks had a 3.65% increase today, ending at $90.63 with a market cap of $6.83 billion. Not too shabby.
195 2019-03-14 21:32:37 Been buying what I can on the dips, Selling off dead beat stocks to buy this winner. ITS GOOOOOO time....
196 2019-03-14 21:32:36 1929, 1987 and 2008 are one-day recoveries in the midst of the market crashes of those years.There was a bank run in March 1933.1931 and 1932 were among the worst years of the Great Depression.Important to remember that stocks can experience short-lived rallies in times of crisis
197 2019-03-14 21:32:21 That’s what I thought too. But there may have been stocks and other investments.
198 2019-03-14 21:31:36 $DIXI looks good and had a nice run today with recent news, but as with most of these pony stocks after a hot run and an open gap let them dip first after they cool off before entry IMO. Need proof? $CHOOM .80 cents $CROP .38 always do your doobie diligence with these bags
199 2019-03-14 21:30:06 Peter, I just finished watching the interview and loved it.. Thank you ... I believe many people share your frustration, I personally have a friend is 100% in stocks b/c “it’s the only way to fight inflation” & “the only way to get a return” 
200 2019-03-14 21:28:47 Except the "savings & investments" went to already super wealthy individuals who were the recipients of stock market boosts that were then able to purchase more stocks.  It did not go to relieving the debt or helping the savings rates of the vast majority of working Americans.
201 2019-03-14 21:27:16 @RobinhoodApp what happens to all the dividends from the stocks I have in your app?

Chinese stocks
212 2019-03-14 21:20:48 @pensionpartners do stocks historically have the world’s central banks openly acknowledging their goal of propping up equity prices?
213 2019-03-14 21:20:09 1) Thinking more about what to do post-GTI payment in 1yr. I'll own it free and clear for the long term. I could put the full payment into stocks/options, which would net a nice return, but I'm already putting away 34% gross. Was thinking Skyline GT-ST and invest the rest, but...

227 2019-03-14 21:09:46 Not a good time to buy, they look to be actually tanking everyone selling, buy multiple stocks as long as the price shows this drop ends with success, back track 24 months and look at the data
228 2019-03-14 21:09:23 The Apple iPhone’s ‘Stocks’ app is user friendly and easy to use but it has much room for improvement. The news provided by Apple is absolutely pathetic and it does not seem to follow any logical pattern or time period for individual stocks @AppleNews @AppleSupport

242 2019-03-14 21:03:15 you legit could grab stocks from 99 percent of packs, since theyre basically stolen stocks lol
243 2019-03-14 21:01:54 Maybe they should of thought about that before signing on the dotted line and then majoring in a useless degree. Like stocks, education is an investment. You screwed up; why am I paying for your mistake? No one forced you to spend $100k to study 17th century Art!

257 2019-03-14 20:57:25 You’re right I don’t know, nor do I claim to know. But given his daily unhealthy obsession with stocks I wonder and I have every right to. And you have every right to disagree.
258 2019-03-14 20:55:49 I am sure the algos have bids and asks both on the same stocks. If I have a long call position of 100 calls and want to add more, I sometimes put a small 5 call sell order in to trick the computers to drop the ask price and then cancel and replace with a buy order.
259 2019-03-14 20:55:12 They're probably thinking of OT13, which wasn't really a full boycott

264 2019-03-14 20:51:50 Again, irrelevant. Huge banks have buy side and sell side arms. They don’t interact except as any sell side analyst would with buy side clients. These exact conditions exist in all controversial stocks at large firms. Trust me - you don’t understand the industry.

283 2019-03-14 20:35:19 I think it's important to know the difference between corporate stocks and crypto currencies.

385 2019-03-14 19:36:03 I do the same thing (especially with stocks like $ULTA). That’s just prudent investing. You’ll feel alright regardless.

390 2019-03-14 19:32:06 damn jyp and sm stocks are dropping too
391 2019-03-14 19:32:04 i get bored and invest in stocks, y’all get bored and fuck randoms. we’re not the same!
392 2019-03-14 19:31:20 My bad guys I thought it was this year. I was excited but didn’t look st the sub text.
393 2019-03-14 19:31:12 con tipo de cambio estable y tanta restricción monetaria que provoca una recesión machaza me parece difícil que esto perdure mas allá de diciembre. Acordate que el crédito No existe y las empresas ya están liquidando stocks....y dolares.
394 2019-03-14 19:30:55 The reason the stocks went down is the rumours that Kyungsoo was leaving. Pls be careful with what you say online. Defamation is not nice
395 2019-03-14 19:30:34 Well. Hes got a history of some shadey stuff (stocks)
396 2019-03-14 19:30:13 YG went down 1.59%
SM went down 1.75%
FNC went down 2.09%
JYP went down 3.17%

so just bc yg, sm, and fnc are the only ones pictured above it doesn’t mean jyp’s stocks didn’t get affected either just saying
397 2019-03-14 19:29:39 Hi there! Sadly as account and tech support we don't have info about current and future stocks on file. It's best to get in touch with your preferred retailers in regards to this. ^MM

400 2019-03-14 19:26:13 $nio plunges 40% while $tsla rises 4.5% since March 5. Both electric vehicle stocks have proven highly volatile and have largely gone nowhere since $nio IPO date in mid-September last year.

402 2019-03-14 19:25:56 Stocks are crazy.
403 2019-03-14 19:24:43 Sitting here looking at @iamcardib tweets and likes go up is like watching stocks number fluctuate
404 2019-03-14 19:24:10 I stopped using it when they banned me for listing too many tickers at once as I was trying to make a valid point that involved several stocks.
405 2019-03-14 19:23:54 Whats killing most traders is the inability to accept the fact that prices fluctuate & the devotion to stop losses. #stocks #reason
406 2019-03-14 19:23:27 I stay out because I can’t reconcile whether he is a genius or fraud. But I acknowledge that this could mean I end up not owning one of the best performing stocks over the next 25 years.
407 2019-03-14 19:23:23 your analysis wont do any good. do some research about those stocks first. read the disclaimer by pannchoa. youre clearly just doing them harm by your so called speculation
408 2019-03-14 19:23:13 I don't like him either, but as long as we have pumpers like him, the stocks will continue to move. Capitalize on it like the rest of us! 
409 2019-03-14 19:22:45 Like I was saying with some conditions my last 4 SSC 7701 I'm just wondering whenever your done with that dude Roberto Carlos Campos if crazy that he had stocks and didn't want any one to make mistakes and cash out on the wrong stock right ,  fedlawroseviltecha171819 ,PS w.m.m.
410 2019-03-14 19:22:36 So I have #stocks in Amazon, Nike, and ExxonMobil they have any other businesses on @Stash that’s on a low buy in I should look into 
411 2019-03-14 19:22:21 Before any final collapse though, I’m convinced we will see both Fed buying of stocks (akin to Japan) as well as true helicopter money, or mailing checks to the masses vs just banks
412 2019-03-14 19:22:01 Invest your money in stocks. HMU for tips. I get money everyday. See my page.
413 2019-03-14 19:21:46 I agree and have my focus on stocks only and process.  No futures, no options no crypto.  Just stocks and process. I have been examining all closed trades 15 days after. Was the entry/stop right. Was the chart good. Did I follow my rules?
414 2019-03-14 19:21:35 Every time I hear that the prospects of Brexit or Trade Deals are already reflected in the stock prices I seriously wonder how such a mess with completely unknown outcome can be reflected in stock prices.

437 2019-03-14 19:09:55 Margins in the sector, globally, are terrible.  And this is despite the fall in alumina spot prices.  Once stocks decline there will be a large correction but maybe not this year.

443 2019-03-14 19:07:52 U.S. stocks flitted between gains and losses on Thursday as uncertainty over when a trade deal between the United States and China would be reached clouded sentiment. In addition, housing data disappoints.

458 2019-03-14 19:00:31 I hope none of them are involved into this mess, but when i see the major drop in the stocks, my feeling is like "something's going to be so wrong..."
459 2019-03-14 18:59:47 I see what you trying to say but stocks are honestly a gamble. If you buy yeezys you can almost always resell them for 200-300 percent.
460 2019-03-14 18:59:22 Up to 57% cash position now. Would be higher but I added a number of puts today to protect some Longs and as a way to short some stocks.
461 2019-03-14 18:58:30 But so far 3 of those companies have suffered a major drop in stocks, there's something wrong if 3 of them suffer major crash tho, like 2 of them are involved into this mess. And also those speculation are from others and i just giving my analysis, sorry if this offends you
462 2019-03-14 18:58:04 Yes, that's awfully cryptic.  What's the trade?  Short EM stocks?  Short RMB?
463 2019-03-14 18:57:53 On average it happens about 3 times a year per stock. So, let's say you're getting alerts for 20 stocks, you should be trading once a week on average from this trigger. That's how I see it (ish)
464 2019-03-14 18:57:40 When it comes to trading stocks, NEVER try and guess the bottom!
465 2019-03-14 18:57:13 With headlines like “stocks could go up or down from here and smart money is hedging”, it’s no surprise we’re all armchair economists now

474 2019-03-14 18:49:20 yes there is possibility of Nifty crossing 11400 i cant deny that but If you see RIl chart on lower time frame it is making Bearish divergence & hdfcbank too look overstretched how much further is anybody's guess. but i am basing my view on lot of stocks which look bearish 1/n

522 2019-03-14 18:22:07 “At the lows 10 years ago in 2009, U.S. stocks were back to where they were in 1996.” - @michaelbatnick 

That is why buy and hold is so difficult.
523 2019-03-14 18:20:41 Y’all need people in your life who love you enough to share udemy courses & talk stocks/trading w/ you when there’s no benefit for them
524 2019-03-14 18:19:43 That is perfectly true. Now, we don’t know whether the Russians still have enormous weaponized stocks or not. But I’d bet anything they still have the seed strains and the capacity to grow and deploy their smallpox weapon.
525 2019-03-14 18:19:11 The best proof of all that stocks trade on technicals and not fundamentals is THIS MARKET...valuations make no sense at all. Are we really supposed to just game central banks and the names they put their fiat into?  Is that what this IS ? How strong are these Gorilla FAANG stocks

540 2019-03-14 18:11:49 I wouldn't do anything with $GE, Sudheen. The stock might be finding a bottom, but it's so darned weak, and there are so many traders who are upside down in this stock that I'm not sure what the upside is.  It might be a winner, buddy. But I just avoid those out-of-favor stocks.

Most people should simply try to have their investments match the markets. Over the last 100 years or so, stocks have returned close to 10% each year, on average. Of course, there are ups and downs. Some years the returns will be great, and in other years, losses hurts.

912 2019-03-14 15:18:54 maybe helping out friends caught off guard by the q4 meltdown who need to mend.

not sure what is going on but clearly, just on the data and neg earn and possibly negative / flat q1 GDP, stocks should not be rising like this and MOSTLY, volatility should not be sinking like this

915 2019-03-14 15:18:13 From the peak of a post-73/74 rally in 1976 until Jan 1980 is one of the worst performances by stocks in American stock market history— along with... 1987 crash.
So your data speaks volumes for what is to come. The question is: will the rally last another year or two?

925 2019-03-14 15:13:35 Inflation affects all assets and commodities (stocks, bonds, gold, oil), but most negatively affects cash. By its definition, inflation reduces the value of cash when it is not backed by and asset. We trade the cash for assets to protect it the value of our earnings.

928 2019-03-14 15:12:41 At a certain point that doesn't work - yields are always falling and the Fed easing entering a recession. And much of the time after 2001 we did have stocks suffering as yields fell. But in general, yes stocks rising and yields falling can be compatible.

956 2019-03-14 15:01:48 True, but in a world of centralized banking and perpetual inflation, we gamble just by living. Stocks and bonds are some of the few weapons we have to protect our earnings and savings over time.

993 2019-03-14 14:42:25 There is many think tanks devoted to producing this material. They have many stocks of this sort of thing on everyone and they release it based on appopriate timing to promote an agenda.
994 2019-03-14 14:42:08 ..identify stocks which I am planning to buy for long term and within this long term period use TA to keep buying & selling. Hopefully I will earn lot more than the CAGR. The list will only have stocks I can focus on & wont cover stocks across sectors or indices. More soon 2/3
995 2019-03-14 14:42:06 This is one of the most highly shorted stocks.  Today a peer-reviewed paper showing proof of concept for the company product SkinTE hit the news.  The shorts are running low on crap to throw at the message boards.  Nothing odd here.  May be the beginning of a short squeeze.
996 2019-03-14 14:41:57 I am considering focusing on a single & simple system for long and short term trades which is easier to understand & execute. I have made profit with this system in many stocks & also recently in Vinati, Dalmia Sugar, LTTS, Kilitch, ABFRL, Astrazeneca & TechM. The idea is to..1/3

1080 2019-03-14 14:00:32 True. The difference is that airlines and aerospace companies are huge players in the stock market and their stocks are volatile based on news reports. Not so with gun manufacturers.

Pres. Trump can’t postpone for 21 months so to time his trade-war with Britain leaving the EU. So, yes he needs a win with the China trade-war and that will send stocks higher or the floor falls out.
