2 2019-03-06 23:59:20 Historically, stocks provide a 10% rate of return over time, which is significantly more than the average percentage earned on a savings account. If you have money that you are saving for the *long term*, you may want to explore investment options. #optionality #adviseral
3 2019-03-06 23:59:10 $SPY You don't need or want to wait for a day like this to understand why I've been posting to be more selective on stocks at these levels.
4 2019-03-06 23:58:37 I feel you , Invest your money so you can get there! Once you start your business hire someone to do everything you were doing and have your profits sit in stocks and other business investments. You got this
5 2019-03-06 23:53:13 Love watching the stocks plummet as trump rambles on
6 2019-03-06 23:52:54 Ok, so even if the Fed technically can't buy stocks, yet, why not just have the BOJ and SNB buy up all shares, and install Boards of Directors who will triple everyone's pay. There's your wage inflation.

Then the Fed & ECB can buy up all debt & forgive it.

This is my MMT plan.

Low floaters $TKAT $RBZ
14 2019-03-06 23:45:34 Yep I agree, a lot of dispersion out there today.  During big bear moves stocks usually become very highly correlated to downside, didn't exactly see that today.
15 2019-03-06 23:45:01 Agree! Look at the save to come from tech. "They" held nflx, fb, googl, very well on a bad breadth day with low volume in these momo stocks. A gap and retrace higher lead by momo tomorrow will not be surprising, coupled with extreme $TRIN today.
