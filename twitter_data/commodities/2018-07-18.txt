1 2018-07-18 23:52:18 FX SUMMARY: AUD WAS A BENEFICIARY OVERNIGHT AS COMMODITIES MOVED HIGHER. AUD RALLIED FROM 0.7342 LOW BACK TO 0.7407 AS FX RANGES REMAIN. INITIAL USD STRENGTH INTO THE LONDON OPEN FADED AND THE USD LOST GROUND IN THE NY SESSION AS WE SAW SOME USD LONG POSITIONS PROFIT TAKING.
2 2018-07-18 23:33:18 An ever increasing “digital” world deserves digital commodities (ie. digital gold and silver, storage, mobile data plans, vr property) just as a “physical” world deserves physical commodities (ie. physical gold and silver, corn, wheat, etc.)
3 2018-07-18 23:20:38 We have devolved into a country that put self-interests above those of We the People. We have gone constitutionally astray from our* implied Civic responsibilites. We have put the value of our commodities above the value of our citizens and changed how our political system works.
4 2018-07-18 23:14:23 what to celebrate then? will it bring good to the dying economy? will it end the killings? will it stop the inhuman treatment of the lumads? will it cheapen the high prices of basic commodities? will it imprison those behind the 6.4B shabu? now, answer me mochang tanga!
5 2018-07-18 23:12:50 It’s bad to assume that measures against sex work under socialism are in any way comparable to measures against sw under capitalism. The latter just is punishing people for being poor while under socialism it’s about supporting workers so their bodies don’t need to be commodities
6 2018-07-18 22:53:23 No comparto. Mejorar o empeorar las exportaciones de commodities son ciclos de un modelo que no toca ni de cerca a millones de argentinos que quieren trabajar para el mercado interno en pesos.

8 2018-07-18 22:46:20 Trump is making decisions that are damaging the US economy like tariffs. The American System introduced tariff on finished imported products and not commodities like aluminium that increases prices and reduces US competitivism. Trump is a form of sabotage for blue collar ppl.

10 2018-07-18 22:35:31 This is it in a nutshell. Turning 27 for a dude is NOTHIN. For a woman? Oh my god might as well start dusting the cobwebs off my body bc we’re commodities to the world and are worth less due to age
11 2018-07-18 22:29:45 ICE is helping stamp out child sex trafficking, DNA disqualifies these SOB illegals from claiming unrelated children to turn them into sick commodities--the pedos MUST pay!
12 2018-07-18 22:24:46 Money is what made Russia keep selling commodities to Germany up to 06/1941,Germany could not have invaded without those.Sometimes political considerations must take precedence,for EU the 4 freedoms are essential because there would be no EU without. They cant compromise on those
13 2018-07-18 22:21:35 I'll go ahead and ngaf cuz it'll be gone in 3 yrs

I remember when commodities and volatility were new asset classes
14 2018-07-18 22:20:47 Well, I can speculate.  We import commodities from Russia (oil, minerals, gems, etc.), which they have a lot of.  We export highly value-added goods like aircraft, machinery, vehicles, etc., but they're still a relatively poor country so very limited market.
15 2018-07-18 22:05:31 We fall well short of meeting our domestic requirements, we tend to export commodities & import value added products, we have lacked processor innovation for domestic products & in export markets
16 2018-07-18 22:02:46 But if a market is just "where people exchange commodities" than markets are just of an inescapable aspect of society, and not something that is going to go away, even under communism.
17 2018-07-18 21:58:48 Marx considers all things that are exchanged in society to be commodities, and a market is nothing more than a place where commodities are exchanged for other commodities of equal value. No reason to think sex wouldn't be included among those commodities.

36 2018-07-18 21:58:27 Police, fire and snow removal do not produce commodities, big difference. You still have a lot to learn.
37 2018-07-18 21:54:57 #CrudeOil Daily Chart: Given this interpretation, CCI (-68.01) is bearish, but has begun showing some strength. Begin looking for an attractive point to cover short positions.

38 2018-07-18 21:51:02 Relative to Sweet crude oil...what a day!!!!! I would say that if you were on the right side of the market today...your earnings were good today; however, I feel for you if you were on the wrong side of the market today....you took a real hit today. #Oil #Commodities
39 2018-07-18 21:49:34 Looks like 2nd half 2018.. the way selling is witnessed all around including all top commodities! It’s time to be cautious n tough times to come. Staying in cash , debt instruments n in Gold for the next 3 to 4 years is a better option! Rising interest rate era is on the cards!
40 2018-07-18 21:40:09 But if you’re running a MF strategy and include BTC futures, what do you put it under? If it’s not equities, rates, currencies, or commodities then it’s fair to classify it as something new. I plan on calling it ‘Digital assets’.
41 2018-07-18 21:24:15 The major problem of the Nigerian masses is to see that the price of food and essential commodities falls down.

Therefore, the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo has to rethink that food is the one that is almost the problem of the people not cement.
42 2018-07-18 21:24:13 There are many factors.  I find gold interesting because of exactly that, it trades with fx, commodities, & rates.  gold is def inversely correlated to real rates. It’s def not the only factor though. $ sold off big in that period so that was factor. Also Commodities were rallyin
43 2018-07-18 21:21:26 I agree BUT most of our purchases of airtime, beer, commodities are $1.00-$5 per day for most Zimbabweans. Plastic money & mobile payments cover the rest. We have 72% living below $1.90.
44 2018-07-18 21:14:22 Companies returning up 23%, Farmers aren't going broke due to tarriffs, soybeans get stored & sold on commodities, manufacturing jobs way up, unemployment way down. Those who gave up searching are coming back to the market. Welfare decreased by a million. More jobs than people

46 2018-07-18 20:53:42 I'm not familiar with the specifics of what Roger has talked about, but I'd suggest that in an economy without money, commodities that are otherwise imperfect for the task will naturally arise as a currency. Nothing unexpected about that.
47 2018-07-18 20:52:52 Academics are cowards who allow the capitalists to turn their minds into commodities, churning out new commodities (students).
48 2018-07-18 20:51:02 Females: get their nails done to impress females; get their hair done to impress females; buy perfume to impress females; buy purses to impress females; buy heels to impress females, and a lot of cosmetic surgery is done because they feel inadequate. Commodities for men?
49 2018-07-18 20:48:58 Equities/Dollar/Bonds crash. Crypto and commodities run. Buy Crypto and commodities. Use profits to buy cheap equities.
50 2018-07-18 20:44:29 Operações de hedge no mercado futura de commodities na @BovespaBolsa são muito mais seguras e livres de risco do que qualquer outra alternativa oferecida no mercado, seja Opções (call ou put) ou venda a termo.
51 2018-07-18 20:38:07 He did work in some new material incl. on Trump and trade wars. On the latter, first instinct is to secure supply esp. of commodities = bullish
52 2018-07-18 20:36:52 Arguing why #decentralized tokens look more like #commodities than #securities: "#tokens have value based on the #utility of the service to participants.

53 2018-07-18 20:35:50 I didn't realize commodities exchanges executed people 
54 2018-07-18 20:33:48 Yeah but you're "middle class" and therefore the "elite". Whereas JRM, Boris "Eton" Johnson and Nigel "Commodities Trader" Farage are men of the people and represent the working class.....
55 2018-07-18 20:33:39 Why are @NBA players so hurt by the @DeMar_DeRozan stuff? They all know they’re commodities. Does it suck? Yes but it’s not new.
56 2018-07-18 20:32:43 C´be, but mostly inspired by Robert Prechter Jr. To be clear, I made my Theory based in many things I read. Not by Academics, nor College, University, Books, conferences, etc. You can pick from hereto another and so , hard work. Occult. Same for Commodities, and some currencies

60 2018-07-18 20:20:15 Own land you can farm and hold commodities of all kinds. Ensure you have internet access and work remotely. Keep some cash and own revenue generating properties outright. That’s the doomsday prepper guide to thriving in a shitstorm. Equities if $ is left.
61 2018-07-18 20:08:40 We need to get manufactured goods since they have value added. There is less money in shipping commodities. Canadians will have to purchase the goods that are made from our resources. I learned that in Montreal West elementary school in the 1950s..

63 2018-07-18 20:04:33 Both relatively unknown Commodities but based on perceived value if they both hit I'd say Mixon is the better asset
64 2018-07-18 20:00:27 If you’re getting commodities from me, be a little more courteous lol don’t boss me around and act like you’re better than everybody. It’s free food. Haha
65 2018-07-18 19:56:29 No. It's just a waste of time and energy. Spend those valuable commodities on looking after you and the important people who will never hurt you.
66 2018-07-18 19:53:54 A5: Point, Click, Purchase works beautifully. If you're selling simple, straight-forward stuff. Y'know, commodities. But, if you're selling appreciation, recognition, motivation, engagement and reinforcement, well then, not so much. #PromoChat
67 2018-07-18 19:52:49 @AliVelshi  Is not the JAPAN - EU trade deal in the vanguard of consequences of Trump #tariffs? Will US agriculture, distributors and commodities traders choose poverty over misguided principles?
68 2018-07-18 19:50:04 Not to mention Disney buying everything in entertainment and Amazon consolidating all commodities. None of these companies are run by people who give two shits about making the world better for anyone but themselves.
69 2018-07-18 19:47:36 There has been an ongoing cycle for years recently to swap out "paper gold" & obtain physical metal. I'm now hearing rumors that "miners" are running a lobby with Wall Street firms to form a "physical metals exchange" & bypass "traditional commodities exchanges".
70 2018-07-18 19:45:10 Cryptocurrencies are certainly not securities. There is no centralized company they represent. Commodities at the very least,  currency at most.

72 2018-07-18 19:40:00 Government as well as investors move to gold when sense risk in other derivative/ man made investment commodities like stocks etc ; Gold price could be a good proxy to see confidence of investor in fin. Market (after some adju.)
73 2018-07-18 19:38:36 There are expensive commodities and cheap commodities. Is gold inherently valuable or is it just rare?
74 2018-07-18 19:36:52 You’re owned by a commodities trader. Buy cheap and sell when you can get the best price. It’s business to him. Our owner wants to win things. Our players expect to win things. That’s the difference between a big club and a selling club. You’re just a springboard to Real or Barca
75 2018-07-18 19:26:28 Think about water—one of the most abundant commodities on earth. 

In bottled form at a convenience store, you happily pay 2,000 times the price compared with getting it from your tap at home. 

The only thing that has changed is packaging and delivery.
76 2018-07-18 19:24:27 Fishhook theory is when fascist incels demand women be treated as property while centrist "woke male feminists" demand that women's bodies be treated as commodities.
77 2018-07-18 19:21:28 The banker who trades in commodities is a murderer.
78 2018-07-18 19:17:04 Actually I know many full-time traders from my career at CBOT and Commodities Corp that have correctly identified and managed hurdles -- including myself. I seek progress, not perfection.
79 2018-07-18 19:11:43 O/N Wrap:
US politics continued to dominate headlines, though impact upon markets was minimal; UK #CPI fell short of expectations, calling into question the projected August #BoE hike; equities and commodities mildly positive; #NZD hanging around 0.6800 like a bad smell.
80 2018-07-18 19:08:37 Progress will remain slow if we do continue to spend money on TB commodities and inadequate investment in structure, capacity of National and WHO TB control programs in countries. History of  TB control the last 20 years ??

83 2018-07-18 19:00:32 The recency bias is so bad on commodities in particular right now (gold included), but also through in long/short strategies, etc., that I don't have the energy to defend them.  When the US stock bull market ends, i'll be game for the discussion.
84 2018-07-18 18:57:14 This is the part of the game I dislike; the business aspect - where players are commodities . DeRozan is more than a talented player - he has true sportsmanship, a love of the game and a rare loyalty to his team. To be a Raptors fan, was to be a DeRozan fan. #WeTheNorth

88 2018-07-18 18:51:54 Is not because he worth $70 billion from owning 37% of the oil company Surgutneftegaz, 4.5% of natural gas company Gazprom, and has substantial holdings in commodities trader Gunvor. No is just magic!
89 2018-07-18 18:48:28 Compete? It allows us to trade out. Right now we export a small amount and import so many commodities that we could produce & pack ourselves. WTO states = 98% of worlds trade flows - we are not a part of. Read up on the WTO & what it means - there is nothing to fear.

91 2018-07-18 18:38:31 Hi so apparently it’s a thing to say that uncircumcised (the correct term is intact) penises are gross. 

First of all. 

How the fuck do women, who have had our bodies objectified and consumed like commodities for millennia, feel it is acceptable to make claims like this?
92 2018-07-18 18:35:29 I'm not sure it needs new terminology. AI doesn't yet exist. It's just been buzzworded and half baked into existence by every middle-of-the-road marketing agency on the planet to sell more commodities. I don't think they deserve praise for even being a part of the evolution.
93 2018-07-18 18:32:14 There were three types done in 1840 which were

96 2018-07-18 18:24:49 Most rapists are Muslim men who are taught to treat non-Muslim women as commodities. You don't know the full story, nor  the culture of India. The news being fed to you are from Congress party controlled press, hell bent on defaming the Modi govt.
97 2018-07-18 18:22:25 Usually this means higher taxes, which big businesses use small businesses to pretend are unfeasible. You asked why I was unhappy earlier; because the individual tax savings were negated by the inflation of staples and commodities

101 2018-07-18 18:16:48 1/ In 2 days we get get clarification on India's stance towards crypto:
 These comments bode well:

"“Though cryptocurrencies belong to a new class of financial assets, we can still welcome them as commodities and not currencies because of their high volatile prices.”
102 2018-07-18 18:15:59 That's totally true. However, launching MMS  needs to get cash deposited and then everyghing will be OK. People will trust MMS as they can receive commodities and some cash too.
103 2018-07-18 18:13:17 Yep all commodities for exchange and well spotted none of them argue for free markets. Misses the point though, its the Bookseller engaging in the market and that capitalist behaviour is what Novara Media are embarking on. Bookseller may even trade as a Ltd company. Hypocrite.

106 2018-07-18 17:58:38 One thing I liked about the congressional hearing with the committee on agriculture was the lively discussion on which can be seen as securities and which can be seen as commodities

I didn’t catch the whole video, will rewatch, but this can bring a new aspect to “digital gold”
107 2018-07-18 17:57:39 "commodities" here just meaning manufactured goods.

And that's not my point. It doesn't matter how want is produced. My point is that anarchist communists fundamentally misunderstand what communism is.
108 2018-07-18 17:47:39 The Wells, Morgan and Merrill firm portfolios usually underperform. Too much academics & searching for perfect models. Too much long/short, fund of hedge funds and commodities. “Be sure you have small cap international, mid cap developed global, Japan overweight in ur model.”

111 2018-07-18 17:43:11 the point I was going to get at is a lot of ancoms or otherwise-communist anarchists say that anarchy=communism because we'll have post-scarcity for most commodities (which is true) and otherwise will just... Not want luxury goods

114 2018-07-18 17:38:50 I thought it was about removing people’s freedom and using them as disposable assets and commodities. Slavery was only really defined by colour during the colonial era.
115 2018-07-18 17:38:48 We think of commodities from a few different perspectives: as an alternative currency and store hold of wealth, as a growth-sensitive asset class, and as an asset with specific supply and demand considerations...
116 2018-07-18 17:35:48 I saw you post somewhere else that gold is going to $1000 now.  I agree that is the next big level, but you will need 10yr real rates to rally another 1% to see that.  That’s a tall order, but we shall see. We are late cycle, commodities will rally, gold will see 1500 before 1000

122 2018-07-18 17:23:44 I don't blame the woman, she's only doing what she's appointed to do in order to collect her salary.

123 2018-07-18 17:22:56 Globalised resources & commodities control economic output. Reducing these inputs by creating industry or work close to where people live, affects things such as Global Warming & protects us against huge Global impacts.
124 2018-07-18 17:22:35 The same goes for the women. The “hot” commodities are the least engaging

134 2018-07-18 16:18:06 We need to stop seeing this as just waste - that's literally a resource floating around ready to be exploited. What does that sort of weight of plastic cost on the recycled commodities market?
135 2018-07-18 16:16:43 Agree strongly with your original point. In fact whole impact of sustained technology led productivity growth is eventually to turn everything—today’s most sophisticated microchip or the highly skilled labor of Wall St analysts—into commodities whose real prices gradually erode
136 2018-07-18 16:16:21 I thinking pegging to a single currency would be no better than holding the currency. I do think stablecoins that are pegged to a basket of commodities could make more sense and be safer than a single currency.

140 2018-07-18 15:59:52 It’s only 2 commodities that you buy elsewhere all the other things that generate a lot of money such as soap, eggs, cornflakes, milk to name a few you buy there. The shop won’t close down just because of mere fruit & veggies my brother. Learn to support your own
141 2018-07-18 15:57:58 Our companies need the bond chief. Before the bond coin business was a nightmare. Our soaps and cooking oil were affected by this. What has helped is plastic money but it doesn’t cover the whole population. On small commodities name one shop that doesn’t accept bond notes.

242 2018-07-18 11:21:16 When the economy is strong the dollar is strong meaning it's harder to export products, thus commodities struggle
243 2018-07-18 11:17:42 These are the questions every guy asks a woman. 1. Are you debt free? 2. Do you have tattoos? 3. What percentage of your portfolio is invested in international commodities? 4. Do you believe in life on other planets?

उनकी हर वस्तु (commodities)भारत की  हर वस्तु से सस्ती हो जायेगी

जिससे उनका export बढ़ेगा

पर एक आंतकवादी देश से कोई भी देश समान खरीदना पसंद नहीं करता

इसके नुक्सान भी बहुत हैं

उनका कर्ज बहुत बढ़ जायेगा

Import मंहगा हो जायेगा। जैसे Oil

251 2018-07-18 09:59:55 This proposal makes sense. Tobacco is progressively taxed and will only affect the index upwards. Unlike commodities and services whc make up the rest of the index
252 2018-07-18 09:54:16 Simes:  Pope. And the previous line is 'Good nature and good sense should ever join'. Not much of those two commodities on show  with Tories at the mo. Plenty of people willing to lie and cheat to hang onto their cushy jobs though. Isn't there? #GeneralElectionNow

254 2018-07-18 09:50:24 From about 2013, I told gents to get in on commodities because they were cheap due to the global knock on commodity prices, plus there was the massive platinum protest in SA. Today, platinum is steady rising. Over the long term that PE ratio and dividend yield will be beastly

267 2018-07-18 07:59:40 @rmajab @KBonimtetezi talked on policy interventions. Things like Tariffs and Quotas. US maintains 46 TRQs on 7 commodities; sugar , tobacco , dairy , beef , peanuts , cotton & green olives. What did @BarackObama do ? #ObamaKaribuDala
268 2018-07-18 07:52:36 What impressed @Eusebius about Patrick Lumamba speech I wuld also have been impressed.He talk of an Africa that does not add value it's commodities.
Whole nuclear programme in SA was all about this adding further stages to mining processing. 
But we were told it's about Guptas.
269 2018-07-18 07:48:13 @arhsummit I am looking forward to the ARH summit because I  believe per the theme, it will provide a conduit through which all actors can discuss the financing of ARH commodities like condoms in a positive manner.
270 2018-07-18 07:45:47 We are already doing that however the basis of the argument was about what have & own such as the land & its commodities; thus the questions: why gold & diamonds from Africa are traded in England? Why is the cocoa exported from African & imported as chocolate from Switzerland?
271 2018-07-18 07:44:53 Commodities: Gold fell 1.08pc to $1,227.71 and Brent gained 0.45pc to $72.16
272 2018-07-18 07:43:19 Listen, by raising Agricultural Productivity, Modernizing Agriculture, Developing Agro-allied industries and Investing in value-added processing for Agricultural commodities, Africa can unlock its Agricultural Potential.
273 2018-07-18 07:42:48 @RockcityFM 
My take is Yes. Too much tax on essential commodities will bring about rise in price of goods. #QuickTakes
274 2018-07-18 07:42:00 @RockcityFM The protest against the tarriff is supported, considering the consumers of those commodities.

276 2018-07-18 07:22:53 i think we have to differentiate art and sex in themselves, from the idea of art and sex as consumable commodities involving some form of exchange. outside a capitalist system both would instead become phenomena of social engagement & organic to communities

279 2018-07-18 07:09:14 Replace *housing with *Land and you have my attention. 

Food and housing are product of labour and are thus property and can be easily traded as commodities. What’s the problem?

Land? Rent monopolies? Wanna talk about something real devious?

284 2018-07-18 06:43:26 Shocked, pained and saddened to see blatant infringement of Packaged Commodities Act in Mumbai. Milk with MRP of Rs 21/- per 1/2 Lt being sold with mark up of Rs 1/- under garb of " frig charges".
285 2018-07-18 06:42:15 You can make that argument for any large commodities company. Bottom line: you want competent management for a company this big you need to pay a lot more than this guy
286 2018-07-18 06:07:11 Bhp announced production stats. Looking good all commodities exceeded guidance. 2018 copper equivalent production up 8%. 2019 production estimates to be equal to 2018. The sale of USA oil progressing and seen to be completed by end 2018. Estimations are around $12bn.
287 2018-07-18 05:55:40 Car is more than a means of transportation. It is an aspiration and status symbol at that level. Nano failed to be that. Only commodities can sell more using the cheap tag not lifestyle goods
288 2018-07-18 05:40:09 Most people on Earth live in a “Poor” country and its even worst for them.  But if you allow people to acquire HUGE wealth quickly, they will find a way to expand the amount of commodities in the world. #tpesa

"Morally permissable" is a sack of shit. There is nothing moral or ethical about this. You are making children commodities if you do this, not living, breathing, feeling (and ect) children. This kind of thing is eugenics, nothing more.

328 2018-07-18 00:05:50 I’m not sure what’s meant by security anymore, but tokenization can be of financial assets like stocks and bonds, or real assets like art, real estate, commodities.
