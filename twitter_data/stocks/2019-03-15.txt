4 2019-03-17 23:54:38 Dog-Man : Peacekeeping Stocks
5 2019-03-17 23:51:45 They paid it back with severely devalued stocks. The American taxpayers took a bath.
6 2019-03-17 23:51:23 1/2 to stocks, but pretty much nothing people posted here. All long term plays that earn if no recession and move big longer term if there is. 1/2 to a business idea I have for a cryptocurrency/business with big potential none thought of. If I get a % of gains for my nonprofit.
7 2019-03-17 23:48:01 Yes, of course, they’d like to see higher oil prices; evidence suggests so far transition is occurring and I’m not worried about economic risks, quite bulllish on stocks
8 2019-03-17 23:47:34 Who told you that?

People who own bump stocks are now considered criminals by the misguided gun ban zealots.
9 2019-03-17 23:46:57 I don’t know how me and @stocks_allison is friends cause she hates everyone
10 2019-03-17 23:46:55 Crazy day

1) took 13 stocks between 2 crew battles, but lost rd 2 because the other players were casuals

2) singles was great, got 5th losing to Laid and LeeT, taking a game off of both

3) super sick of dying to brawler up b, gotta fix something so I don't play 2 stock games
11 2019-03-17 23:45:53 I just don’t understand how people would want to go back to crap. I keep saying historically low unemployment, lower taxes, jobs coming back, strong military, stocks amazingly well...I mean the list goes on and on!
12 2019-03-17 23:45:48 Scott you're making me rethink. I hold 4 to 5 at a time and let them work until they break a moving average with volume. Up 23% this year. Concentrating more money into less stocks moving fast only way to compound like that. Nice job.

14 2019-03-17 23:39:00 Ross, I know this saying tends to get overused, but, please stay in your own lane.  You are a snake oil salesman.  You buy ETFs, a few mega cap stocks and newsy stocks like Tesla and call yourself an asset manager.  GMAFB

16 2019-03-17 23:38:35 >>> Monday morning stocks
17 2019-03-17 23:37:20 But prices have gone to the moon?
Health insurance 
College tuition 
Houses
Cars
Stocks 
Where do we not see asset inflation?

To me, QE has caused asset inflation, thereby raising prices and increasing wealth inequality.
18 2019-03-16 23:59:48 A huge Thankyou to @TheBiscuitFund for your help keeping stocks up to meet demand for #foodparcel referrals #rossendale
19 2019-03-16 23:59:36 Just how much stocks does Jonghyun hold in FNC.... Must be a big chunk for FNC to do this for him...
20 2019-03-16 23:59:17 I think a couple of my stocks are gonna pop...
21 2019-03-16 23:58:57 On a longer timeframe if CBs can’t steady the ship it could see a move.  

But then if they keep printing money it’ll keep making its way to prop up overinflated stocks.  Who’ll chase gold if CBs keep papering over the cracks?
22 2019-03-16 23:57:22 Y'all motherfuckers with the 3 minutes 3 stocks think you're so fucking clever?
23 2019-03-16 23:55:33 Walmart stocks it so it’s gotta be good. Walmart never disappoints!
24 2019-03-16 23:54:05 @GarroteSSB ¡Menos likes a placenteros 4-stocks a Linkeiro y más PM!

¡Nada puede igualar la sensación de 4-stockearle tú mismo!

Vente a algún torneo :P
25 2019-03-16 23:53:54 Keynes had a thing about picking stocks which was like the second one.
26 2019-03-16 23:53:41 It was an overwhelming sensation and a discovery that we knew would change life in a very big way and impact most people on planet earth. I was into stocks heavily diversified and heavily invested & made a killing. I’m using the EXACT same strategy with #crypto with same feeling
27 2019-03-16 23:53:13 Actually a different perspective.  

Gold crashed with the markets in 2008 by 30%.  Then rallied alongside stocks from 2009 onwards.  So it’s a mixed bag. Cash is king.  If there’s a recession then you’ll be paying your liabilities with cash not necessarily    gold or bitcoin.
28 2019-03-16 23:52:50 I propose that the 3 morons be placed in public stocks and be egged. $5 a throw with money raised going towards a charity. I wonder who would make the most money?
29 2019-03-16 23:50:05 My goal this summer is to go up north with my mom and drive around the sunflower patches and steal the giant stocks of sunflower so I can dry some and use them and admire the rest
30 2019-03-16 23:49:59 And you sure don't need high capacity magazines and bump stocks and body armor - and our police departments don't need to be armed and behave like occupying forces that hold the natives in contempt
31 2019-03-16 23:45:24 YEAH I SEEN THIS MUST BE A LIBERAL AND CHARGE HUH THEIR STOCKS WILL BE GOING DOWN IF NOT ALREADY
32 2019-03-16 23:43:32 Should be put into stocks in the middle of the village green and pelted with hardened balls of antelope dung
33 2019-03-16 23:41:44 It was real shit. Used do heaps food challenges but i found many of them make the food real crap so its tuff. Like some of the big snitz challenges ive done they are cooked overdone so are chewy..like stocks u win some lose some. 
34 2019-03-16 23:40:28 Consulting business that focuses on financial management (stocks, bonds, insurance, estate planning), writing business plans for future entrepreneurs, sports agent, etc.
35 2019-03-16 23:38:26 New Zealand, after one mass shooting that killed 49 people in Christchurch: Well, time to ban semiautomatic weapons 

America, after a mass shooting that killed 58 people in Las Vegas: BUT MY BUMP STOCKS
36 2019-03-15 23:57:42 Invest in food stocks and big agrotech
37 2019-03-15 23:57:09 And just to add to the complication of trying to figure out ALL the fees, there is a TER which is the Trading Expense Ratio. The TER is the commission cost to buy and sell the stocks & bonds in the fund & is paid by the client. So total fee is MER + TER.
38 2019-03-15 23:56:49 Did she mention not manufacturing big box magazines, bump stocks or semi-automatic rifles? Well, inc ase she didn't, I did.  Why'd it take you this fucking long to call her anyway?
39 2019-03-15 23:56:49 Mello you might have missed the bottom, but still lots of upside left!!! Huge discount to NAV! Co has proven itself to build value for shareholders. One of the few MJ stocks that is buying back stock 

Long $SOL
40 2019-03-15 23:56:20 I'm for putting up a limit to how much you can make while in office. And that they shouldn't be allowed to own any stocks or buy any stocks while serving in office.
41 2019-03-15 23:56:10 I’m currently sitting at $342K in my TFSA, but there’s no way they can look at my past activity and say I’m day trading. And I’ve made more of an effort to speculate in my other account and not touch my TFSA stocks (ACB, WEED and HMMJ) this year.
42 2019-03-15 23:55:51 Katong scandal ni Seungri sa bigbang wad an silag stocks.
43 2019-03-15 23:54:21 They are still the same asset class, wouldn’t stocks be a proper hedge- there are still some good stocks that are discounted, and has plenty of room to grow.
44 2019-03-15 23:53:00 wouldn't that be the same as only buying momentum stocks, the fact you hold a position makes no difference
45 2019-03-15 23:52:38 Besides, Trump's net worth is dependent on stocks. You know how values of stocks swing. Did you think about Buhari earnings & expenditures (he was probably spending his earnings) before becoming the President and having access to insane allowances, privileges and good salary.
46 2019-03-15 23:51:50 Oh i dont think it will take that long. it aint the stock market. I think it will go up rather quickly and then maybe once the total mcap is around 7-10 Trillion it might start acting more like stocks and start tapering off.
47 2019-03-15 23:51:43 How did @IlhanMN and @AOC even get elected into our government. They are both anti American laughing stocks. Get them out along with @SenFeinstein and @SpeakerPelosi  our country would be better off without them. Replace them with people like @RealCandaceO 
48 2019-03-15 23:51:29 Bragging about a pick narrowly beating the Nasdaq in the same timeframe is pathetic. Adobe is one of my favorite tech stocks, but the earnings were a flop, clearly.

Get with the program.
49 2019-03-15 23:51:21 yes !! just check back when it’s closer the concert date bc that’s usually when they lower their prices to get rid of the stocks
50 2019-03-15 23:49:05 Do you know a good screener which gives ichimoku based signals? Say all spy or qqq stocks above tenken line?
51 2019-03-15 23:48:51 spot on he started off badly but by voting for no deal he has recovered some credibility, unlike Javid and hunt who are now laughing stocks
52 2019-03-15 23:48:45 First will make sure bunker is stocked. Afterwards will wonder if they know the difference of S&P sector/stock composition back then. Little Wikipedia=90 stocks until in 1950s=500
53 2019-03-15 23:48:39 Gammon stocks are low. #Article50Excuses
54 2019-03-15 23:47:50 Hustlin' bago sumikat ang araw to pick up my stocks and suyurin ang buong San Jose, Batangas.  Another hundreds of sets restocked my lovely partners!
