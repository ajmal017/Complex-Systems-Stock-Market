7 2019-01-21 23:53:03 Going live to review some #stocks.  Feel free to join me on my #youtube channel.  This is a good way to learn how to #invest
8 2019-01-21 23:52:31 BTS could make a solid living off just like buying a bunch of shares for somethin like idk pillowcases and then go like “o yeah my favorite pillowcase is this brand !!” and watch the stocks shoot up overnight
9 2019-01-21 23:49:48 Contrary to what u believe rallying stocks is good for everyone.  A potential signal for a recession is a big news story.  And if you watched the media you implicate for not talking about it you would find they DO report on stocks every day

11 2019-01-21 23:48:39 This is why the stocks should be brought back. So we can throw tomatoes at the vile bastards who think it's big, clever and funny yo disrespect our fallen.

By the way, when I say tomatoes, i mean the tinned variety.
12 2019-01-21 23:48:17 Awesome work Maurice for driving in stocks and for inspiring our associates at 6555! Congrats on the Homer award! @HectorAPadilla @DaveRebtoy
13 2019-01-21 23:47:46 Where does Jesus stand on guns? Silencers? Scopes that can “defend” you from a mile away? Bump stocks? Sandy hook? Stoneman Douglas? Trashy gun peddlers who spread fear/hatred? My point is: STFU.
14 2019-01-21 23:46:42 Top of their game! Usually Alpha males. Those with70’s style DJ mops should be put in stocks and have small avocados thrown at them. Preferably unripe

17 2019-01-21 23:43:46 j’ai la haine ce matin j’ai fais un panier zara la moitié est parti wsh vous avez dévalisé les stocks en une journée
18 2019-01-21 23:43:12 After winning Glitch, Tweek said that he played around Wario's win condition, which is his fart lol 

And he won the whole event with that battle plan 

I think Richter's win condition is landing good axes to take stocks

What do you think is your main's win condition?
