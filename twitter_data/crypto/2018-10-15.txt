1 2018-10-15 23:59:48 If your holding and complaining, easiest way to solve that problem is sell your bag and shut the fuck up. Nobody forced you chase any pump, and if thats what youre doing, you deserve to lose anyhow.... complainers, go get some money and stop praying for crypto pumps

15 2018-10-15 23:56:53 I can only assume other platforms with follow @Fidelity and have their own version of access to crypto.

They really sparked a fire with their announcement, a fire under the asses of all the other investment firms telling them they need to hurry up.
