49 2018-01-11 23:57:32 They outsmart you when you have sold them all your precious crypto against their Ripple. They still have lots of Ripple left to sell to you. 
You can't buy a backbone with Ripple.
50 2018-01-11 23:57:30 Out of all the crypto currency communities...I feel like the doge community has been the most transparent and nice people
51 2018-01-11 23:57:18 13000 Support of $BTC stood tight. Uptrend now and may be the correction is over

58 2018-01-11 23:56:08 Some people look at the state of the  #crypto market and see red. I look at it and see a sale. Time to buy.

#XRP #TRX #BTC #ETH #cryptocurrency
59 2018-01-11 23:56:06 A photo centric crypto currency. What could possibly go wrong?
60 2018-01-11 23:56:05 $EBST bouncing #EBST #Crypto $BTC
61 2018-01-11 23:56:04 The gift that keeps on giving
62 2018-01-11 23:55:46 After been fooled once. I hope to make more money on crypto to send my daughter to a good school and pay my rent on time
63 2018-01-11 23:55:43 It does not matter even... Eth will overtake bitcoin... and crypto life will go on.... as it’s in real life. Who thought that apple once will be such a big company... or Nokia is not marketleader. Crypto is here to stay. Only this matters.
64 2018-01-11 23:55:43 I see massive Problems in future. Everything will Pump 2018, but time will come several projects can't deliver what they promised to people, this will cause massive panic sells and justified FUD. After this everything will perform well. Mark my words. $BTC $Crypto $XVG $ETH $XRP
65 2018-01-11 23:55:39 My longer term goal is/has always been to acquire more BTC. I’ve been trading alts against it in the short term and it’s worked out okay-ish (XPR, ADA), waiting on ETC, STRAT and APPC now. Kinda just fumbling my way through! #noob
66 2018-01-11 23:55:30 I hope you are joking haha
67 2018-01-11 23:55:29 Crypto City baby
68 2018-01-11 23:55:18 It's really telling when they say that as a defense of Pump and Dumps, Ponzi Schemes, and Wash Trading rather than a condemnation of unregulated crypto.
69 2018-01-11 23:55:12 What
All dis coin, I'm having 300trx nd I'm feeling like a rich here. 
What wil you be thinking then?
Some people ar just fortunate
70 2018-01-11 23:55:02 Is this the end of crypto trading?
71 2018-01-11 23:54:59 Pontiac what is your crypto portfolio worth my dude ?
72 2018-01-11 23:54:59 Yes just like every other crypto. An iou for someone who will give you fiat for it. Let’s be serious. Bitcoin convention isn’t even accepting bitcoin lmao. R u joking. The only good debatable point you have is 60% owned by the company who created it. So offer a solution?
73 2018-01-11 23:54:45 crypto is the future!!! ;)
74 2018-01-11 23:54:38 So had #cash to spare from holiday bonus. did a #test, bought more #crypto, new PF. 

1 from a project I like

1 from looking at #charts

1 from a #twitter/#telegramm tip

1 from official group

1 from pure random dice roll

Guess which ones went up, and wich went down?? #bitcoin
75 2018-01-11 23:54:27 I don’t hate, it’s just a crypto. I just wouldn’t invest in it. And I agree it’s useful. But even if all the banks in the world use it that doesn’t mean it will be valuable. I hope you can see the distinction.
76 2018-01-11 23:54:11 Thanks for the follow @cryptodailybull How is the Crypto market doing?
77 2018-01-11 23:54:10 Thanks a lot for all the services you provide man.  People are often misunderstood and if you don't have haters, you're a nobody and doing nothing in life, and you're not challenging the social norms. I applaud you my man.  Can I get a follow?
78 2018-01-11 23:54:05 Yeah @KFCAustralia is too slow to do anything like this
79 2018-01-11 23:54:04 Will #altcoins pump together with #bitcoin this time? $crypto - retweet to get more accurate results! $btc $ltc $eth $bch $xrp $iota $ada $trx 
80 2018-01-11 23:53:58 Sure, what do you have in mind? PM or email if easier.
81 2018-01-11 23:53:57 Had problems getting verified also. I just tried again and again and the picture from my ID was not taken correctly. Once I played with it for awhile and tried different angles it verified me within 15 minutes. Maybe try that? I also haven't tried any other exchanges so unsure.
82 2018-01-11 23:53:56 I'm glad there's a Crypto Pepe

83 2018-01-11 23:53:54 Crypto trading juga.
84 2018-01-11 23:53:48 Yeah Schumer is screaming about the Corporate reductions.  He doesn't think that we know that Corporations don't pay taxes.  They collect them from the very same people screaming to raise their taxes.  Stupid is as stupid does.
85 2018-01-11 23:53:38 @JayChizza I’m kinda new to the whole crypto wave, was wondering if you could give me some advice on what coins would be best to invest in the short/long run. I’m currently using Binance. Been watching your videos for the past 6 months & love the content!
86 2018-01-11 23:53:26 crypto trading and especially hodling should be taught in school, so kids dont mess up their promising future. #crypto
87 2018-01-11 23:53:23 I’ve already done that, what are you waiting for?!
88 2018-01-11 23:52:55 This may have spoiler me as my first trade back in crypto. Up 3x...
89 2018-01-11 23:52:42 #FakeNews Is getting out of control when it comes to Crypto.
90 2018-01-11 23:52:37 I enter "crypto zen" when trading. No fomo.  No rage
91 2018-01-11 23:52:35 Everything is nice about zap haha, the team is insane, 
literally the best! They helped legalizing crypto's in Belarus and presented the idea of Oracilzing the Oil Fields to help end the Financial Crisis in Venezuela. They solved a problem and everyone will use zap in the future!
92 2018-01-11 23:52:34 Let me get in on that XRB!

94 2018-01-11 23:52:13 People get shunned and insulted for trying to learn. Another issue in this world. You all want money into this crypto currency? Stop insulting and looking down on people. 
95 2018-01-11 23:52:10 Maybe whales made us buy high this whole time? Maybe 6k is also high? Maybe 1k?

125 2018-01-11 23:49:22 I like your choice of words. What is senseless dribble to you is the reason why I'm still invested in #crypto as well. I'm not an advisor,  marketer or anything related to any coin, but i Can clearly see the opportunity. If you don't like my enthusiasm, skip my post.

140 2018-01-11 23:48:28 It's interesting to see that with all announcements of XRP making these partnerships, that the price isn't rising. Seems like investors are getting crypto-fatigue.
141 2018-01-11 23:48:26 If I was a nasty asshole I'd say what a piece of shit coin it was. Lol. But I'm not going to that. I'm going to just hope my buy order hits.
142 2018-01-11 23:48:26 @ummjackson The reason I enjoyed $DOGE in 2013 was it got me understanding crypto and learning how to mine. stored away 18,000 i mined and now they are worth something. wtf.
143 2018-01-11 23:48:20 ...another so-called "partnership". Even your die-hard "fans" are going to start seeing right through you when they realize that you're just hype!

144 2018-01-11 23:48:17 @RonnieMoas loved your interview on Bad Crypto. As always, I learn more each time I listen.

151 2018-01-11 23:47:58 It’s not even two weeks into 2018 and people are moaning that #trx #tron hasn’t exploded in price. Seriously some people are so clueless it hurts me @justinsuntron #hodl #crypto
152 2018-01-11 23:47:57 Congrats!
153 2018-01-11 23:47:56 You didn't read my tweet.  I was talking about the crypto people who started shilling for XRP as if it was the greatest thing ever despite their previous declarations about the importance of decentralisation and financial freedom.  Seems nobody bothers to read anymore.
154 2018-01-11 23:47:46 Hi John, great to see that you took action upon the bad experience!
155 2018-01-11 23:47:46 POSの場合は初めからマイニングするノードが選ばれているので、ブロック生成時間が短くてもフォークしてしまうことはないように思いますか、いかがでしょうか？
富の集中などの問題はおいておいて、脆弱性の問題はないのでしょうか？
156 2018-01-11 23:47:39 Yep.. I am 50/50 on verge and trx.. Almost at my breaking point to dump them both just to get on something else to have it stall out lol
157 2018-01-11 23:47:33 first he talk down on crypto now he said he dont really know that much about crypto
like my mom did

159 2018-01-11 23:47:27 You are typically in « snake oil crypto » mode, saying everything is cleaner on your side, with no problem at all, without trouble.
160 2018-01-11 23:47:07 
161 2018-01-11 23:46:57 First of all shit is the sign of money! Gdax isn't church, they are here also for a shit, a lot of it :) But speaking seriously XRP is investment, great investment, and most of the people in crypto space are investers and not ideologies or religionists. Let's get the shit Rocket!
162 2018-01-11 23:46:47 Looking for any and all thoughts on how to implement a #blockchain solution for business that complies with the #RightToBeForgotten - would love to hear any solutions or thoughts that anyone has on this.

163 2018-01-11 23:46:42 ECC is an old coin that’s coming back from the dead. Currently rebranding. I expect it will pick up when the new website and wallet are released this month.
164 2018-01-11 23:46:39 Good argument Mark!  I hope you’ll learn how to do your own research rather than rely on the opinions and pumps of others. So far it’s been recorded how many times Crypto Coin News has been wrong.
165 2018-01-11 23:46:22 "I love how people say random shit because of disbelief". I feel that the majority of crypto players say things like that out of no where. My bad Xanax. Might want to lower your script... Just saying. I feel insulted from a cocky ass comment like that when you don't know me. 
166 2018-01-11 23:46:17 If you have been paying attention, this has little to do with whales manipulating the market. Nearly the entire crypto market is in the red. No need to make excuses for a failing market. It is just what it is right now.
167 2018-01-11 23:46:05 A man who set an example. The monster fam misses you @ashcrypton
168 2018-01-11 23:46:00 Price didnt go up much
169 2018-01-11 23:45:59 @brockpierce Hey just heard your interview w/ @cryptomanran, and your perspective b/t the 1999-00 internet market and the crypto market of today blew my mind. Great interview and great advice. Thanks!!!
170 2018-01-11 23:45:47 me too lol
171 2018-01-11 23:45:41 I don't want to say it because I have a massive buy order that hopefully will hit.
172 2018-01-11 23:45:40 Bless you x
173 2018-01-11 23:45:40 With $crypto taking it in the shorts right now, think outside the box. Take this time to learn.  Watch some trading videos from OG stock guys, watch patterns, trace fib sequences.  Learn and prepare. Practice invest.  Just cause your bags are full, is no reason to bow out
174 2018-01-11 23:45:35 YAY!! I live in NC. Glad to see some good being done with these BS coins/tokens in the #crypto space. We don't need or want them here!

177 2018-01-11 23:45:28 @durov Dear Mr Durov In recent few days a new digi-coin called " #GRAM " has appeared in #crypto_currency market claiming a direct association (owned by) with #telegram. Would you care to comment?

182 2018-01-11 23:45:13 I have no connection with $OST.  

Don't get me wrong, I am not bashing $TRX.  I'm just saying that both deserve a look.  I am excited by the connections being made by both #Tron and #Simpletoken.
183 2018-01-11 23:45:10 @MoviePass @netflix @redbox @mitch__lowe  any deal coming soon? Like a premium package or anything of the sort? Btw pls dont crypto.

188 2018-01-11 23:44:29 It’s very possible we won’t see a jump until 2nd half 2018. Maybe even 2019. But if you believe in the technolgy then no sweat. #xrp #ripple #crypto #trx

191 2018-01-11 23:44:22 And i havent even made enough to buy a broken down VN commodore from crypto yet  #keephustling
192 2018-01-11 23:44:15 If you’re not buying crypto during the dip, then just delete your Coinbase account now
193 2018-01-11 23:44:13 Why don't they just stick with the original? $btc should be the coin for the oldies non tech savvy. How did they hear about Ripple? Why do they want to buy Ripple? It's interesting how Ripple found its way to those people not really in crypto. Why Ripple and not $eth or $ltc?
194 2018-01-11 23:44:08 Great film isn’t it!!

201 2018-01-11 23:43:07 1/ Please do not be hung up on bitcoin. There are multiple other crypto coins each with their own use case. Don't like pseudonymous nature of BTC, use Monero; don't like the cost of BTC transaction use Litecoin or Dash;
202 2018-01-11 23:43:06 Every time I get the notification that BTC is less than £10k I want to buy in. No chart or evidence but *feels* like there’s more dip to come before challenging ATH.

242 2018-01-11 23:38:58 DAX is influenced by real production and effectiveness of companies, crypto’s are just hypes mostly, their value is only what people believe, and FOMO plays a very important role there, what is better than twitter to distribute FOMO among traders and make them pump your coin?

- ability to add coins that were mined or remove coins that were given/spent from a portfolio. For now you have to pick a rate etc...

255 2018-01-11 23:37:34 Any chance we could add a 4th layer to the plan?

With Visa pulling the pin, on crypto supported debit cards, there's an opportunity for another player to step in. 

This interim period, pre-mainstream adoption of e-wallets may require a full-time crypto card.

283 2018-01-11 23:35:39 So true. The 6 words out of my mouth when anyone asks me about crypto:

"I'm an investor, not a trader"
284 2018-01-11 23:35:37 This may sound dumb, but a part of me welcomes pullbacks like this in the crypto market... 

I know that when it bounces back that there will continue to be higher lows and an overall larger market cap...

Higher lows... That's the key, higher lows.

304 2018-01-11 23:34:25 $TRX getting squeezed at the bottom of the triangle. Breakout imminent, surely? Or will NORTH KOREA ban crypto too? Honestly, the bullshit FUD is just endless.

306 2018-01-11 23:34:03 Just found out that @ZapOracles  presented at microsoft Berlin and at Google HQ in Mountain View. Also they helped legalize cryptocurrencies in Belarus! This team suprises me everyday! They want $zap to succeed but also crypto's and blockchain! This is the reason I've invested!
307 2018-01-11 23:33:40 That sweet crypto, they've gotta have it!

Is this an official admittance of the credibility of blockchain?
308 2018-01-11 23:33:40 I’ll sell you crypto for a HOC slot ;)
309 2018-01-11 23:33:37 I work for one of the big 3. Our bonus day was today. This man speaks the truth. That being said, we also were sternly warned about investing in crypto by our payers....
310 2018-01-11 23:33:33 @TheCryptoDog how do you feel about $PROC? Double down?
311 2018-01-11 23:33:33 It's a crypto class tho...

314 2018-01-11 23:33:15 I can't believe its finally happening. I am not emotionally prepared.
315 2018-01-11 23:33:13 Getting into crypto a year ago has literally changed my life.

318 2018-01-11 23:33:06 Totally! @notsofast should tell them how they could disrupt the blockchain space by using Syscoin's decentralized marketplace! #win #FingerLickinGood #fintech
319 2018-01-11 23:32:58 I believe that @Bitcoin will reach a price of 150k US by the mid of 2018 and that this year will be the year of revelation of crypto values to the world. Most of the media will talk about it, finally.
320 2018-01-11 23:32:54 @SatoshiLite will you be speaking with the senate Banking Committee in February about Crypto or will they only be consulting with legacy Financial institutions? Specifically with @MikeCrapo & @SenWarren @SherrodBrown

339 2018-01-11 23:30:58 Do you really think crypto is going to shut down the banks and take over the entire fiat currency system? We’re not pirates. Banks will remain and XRP will solve a 26 trillion dollar problem. People just need to adapt and buy XRP or miss the boat and wish you had. #xrpthestandard
340 2018-01-11 23:30:57 It’s a fucking crash , welcome to crypto where shit goes downhill and you have to have big boy pants , but BTC to me is DEAD and definitely needs that hard fork because people are realizing it’s trash to trade with and slow to transfer
341 2018-01-11 23:30:54 Locky - need you to start accepting tips in crypto currency , its 2018

347 2018-01-11 23:30:26 Saying differently, we already have strong and working crypto. We just don't have « usable » tools using this crypto.
And why we haven't such tools is perhaps because is impossible to have usable AND secure tools. Some kind of Zooko triangle.
348 2018-01-11 23:30:21 Crap i owned zcash back at $20 oh well ive had good gains elsewhere
349 2018-01-11 23:30:16 U really think 250,000± new folk coming into exchanges every day are 'crypto people'? I don't
350 2018-01-11 23:30:09 Ripple is such a good coin tho, I mean all xrp people buy high then panic sell then rebuy tops... it's made me like a third of my portfolio.
351 2018-01-11 23:30:08 I said: Do I have to pay money to receive money?

All your and his arguments are flawed. I'm connected. I have a channel. He has the invoice. Still NO money ... balance: "0"

375 2018-01-11 23:28:29 #CME joining crypto was amazing, it shows the world is embracing it.

But wallstreet knew about CME a year ago probably. Thats when they started to accumulate BTC. And when the moment was there (17dec) they shorted and dumped, causing FUD and panic.

They will keep repeating it.

379 2018-01-11 23:28:01 Don't worry about the frequent dips... Blockchain works (even if #Bitcoin doesn't) and there is proof of it.

Just #HODL, just chill, even buy more, and just wait my friends. 

Everything will go up and valuations will be back to the way they were! Q1 2018 is going to be huge 
380 2018-01-11 23:27:55 Yay! Thanks for this contest! 
381 2018-01-11 23:27:37 Journalists don't do their research properly and contact you thinking you contributed to #Dogecoin more recently than 2014, which is like a century ago in crypto-time, and then you do not forward them on to the actual developers. I don't understand what this is meant to achieve.

Your dynamo metaphor is weak too, and what's all this talk of adults, do you have a complex or something? How old are you anyways, since you brought it up?

They say that gold's the skin of the gods
You can’t take the band there when you’re gone"

413 2018-01-11 23:24:51 Ads pop on my Facebook saying "This ex-hedge fund manager says this will be the next Bitcoin". Now, Bitcoin and other crypto value fluctuates because of rumors. So, is this how you start a rumour?? #bitcoins #ignoranceIsBliss

423 2018-01-11 23:24:07 South Korea isn't banning crypto, but even if it did, it's not gonna be big deal. Have you ever asked how come Korea is so important for the crypto? I'll tell you a secret - because it's the entry point for the Chinese money. They can easily move to Japan or Mongolia or Australia
424 2018-01-11 23:23:57 Expect a very ugly Friday... many crypto making a slight higher daily high but ending the day at much lower lows than yesterday.  $btc $eth $bch $ltc but this is crypto so you never know!

435 2018-01-11 23:23:26 This is interesting, going against the finance ministry's advisory against crypto currencies 
436 2018-01-11 23:23:24 Yet it has been partnering with major Chinese companies.  A lot of crypto went down recently you idiot. Eat your words once this skyrockets and your scrambling to get in when it’s too late to make the real money.
437 2018-01-11 23:23:24 The whole #crypto market has been down all week. Wall street/whales most likely keeping prices low until they get bonus checks on the 15th. Expect a major bull run next week. #Bitcoin #XRP #Ripple #TRX #Tron #XVG #cryptocurrency #ETH #LTC #BTC #CryptoNews

449 2018-01-11 23:22:36 Can someone please explain this to me? South Korea wants to ban crypto trading, they operate in a market completely separate from the rest of the world, but #Ethereum plus  majority is going down bc of it? Who cares what they do. We can’t trade there anyway. I don’t understand
450 2018-01-11 23:22:36 I just think that #xvg doesn't have that good of a product that's all. There are way too many other cryptos out there with better coins/tokens/applications/etc. Also I didn't not see much growth actually 
451 2018-01-11 23:22:35 Delta slow... Haha... Blockfolio is slow! You are good guys ;)

459 2018-01-11 23:22:08 @kucoincom You should tell us all when we are going to get our missing crypto. 100's of cases and all you mention is congestion and delays. Its been 5 days and i still dont have my ETH.
460 2018-01-11 23:22:06 South Korea pulling out of crypto will be counter balanced by bottomsup fitness entering the fray
461 2018-01-11 23:22:04 I am not part of the #ripple $xrp community nor do I own any but I would like to congratulate them for the #MoneyGram partnership. I've used MoneyGram many times in my life and they have a very bright future if all goes well $TRX #cryptonews #cryptocurrency #crypto

475 2018-01-11 23:20:51 So who gives a damn

501 2018-01-11 23:19:16 I'm done with Crypto Currencies. It's been fun learning about them but the systems to trade are not great, fees are high, and there's nothing  supporting their values. It seems like a lot of high testosterone nerdy millenials trading it, based on the forums.

528 2018-01-11 23:16:05 It’s a good point, but it won’t stop/suppress cryptocurrency. If the US bans it, I can guarantee you a foreign “Amazon” will pop up that does accept crypto and ship products back into the US and it will gain a huge amount of business from people rebelling against the ban.

559 2018-01-11 23:13:41 I wouldn't listen to anyone on twitter, claiming to be a crypto expert. They give out vague price predictions and basic charting. Most of them just want your refferals or to sell you something. Do your own research. #BTC #TRX #XVG #LTC #Crypto

You're free to come to your own conclusions and allocate your time, energy, and funds accordingly, of course.

For myself, I agree with him that most crypto exchanges are hotbeds of massive ongoing fraud and current market prices are wildly distorted as a result.

593 2018-01-11 23:11:00 So you can't hold crypto, but you are an author of a crypto book, so you are indirectly profiting from cryptos... assuming anyone would actually buy your book.

609 2018-01-11 23:10:05 Let them wait a little please. The market is bleeding. Publishing now will have zero effect 
610 2018-01-11 23:10:00 I saw nothing stupid on her statement. F-ck conbase and better everyone gets what their intentions on their user the better. By this I mean: USE conbase (like they use u) - if there’s no other way get fiat there and use gdax so u don’t pay a $ to them to transfer to anywhere else
611 2018-01-11 23:09:46 Crypto backdoors or inherent crypto flaws can absolutely put lives at risk. Which is exactly why crypto backdoors should be opposed. I don’t think it’s occurred to FBI officials that mandating Apple to put in crypto backdoors would make FBI agents’ own phones vulnerable.
612 2018-01-11 23:09:43 There is a strange obsession with being pure carnivore in the crypto space sorry.
613 2018-01-11 23:09:41 Ok alt coins, let's go back up now....

614 2018-01-11 23:09:28 Vechain, IOTA, NEO
615 2018-01-11 23:09:22 Will crypto weather the storm.   tons of people on the side lines.  Smart players picked company’s at huge discounts.
616 2018-01-11 23:09:19 I think that goes without saying, but I would have more confidence in being able to withdrawal money from a TDA or Etrade account in the event of a crash, than in a crypto account.  I mean, they should have the funds, but with no regs or enforcement, your $ is more vulnerable

624 2018-01-11 23:08:32 I will be there
625 2018-01-11 23:08:31 @wire allows you to be synced to multiple devices and is based on the same double-ratchet crypto as Signal. Bonus: You don't have to give them a phone number to sign up!
626 2018-01-11 23:08:21 We need urgent tax reform if it isn't 100% certain taxable. Maybe a new tax structure altogether for crypto. #ATO #TAX
Of course Turnbull is asleep at the wheel so won't do a damn thing to fix it.

629 2018-01-11 23:08:03 where is the new website?
630 2018-01-11 23:07:56 Crypto? Last month it was all about Bitcoin! What happened? 
631 2018-01-11 23:07:53 Hey you I've brought your courses and wondering what's the best wallet to keep crypto on? I'm using binance & need to bring them out but unsure what wallet to use for Alts, can you give me heads up, be ones like tron which I know u don't like verge & kmd
632 2018-01-11 23:07:50 C++ existed long before the first blockchain. Simply search for good C++ devs with strong mathematics competences and they should have no problem understanding how to come with blockchain solutions. Even if they never worked on bitcoin before. Source code is well documented.
633 2018-01-11 23:07:50 2018 is the year every man and his dog becomes a crypto currency stock broker because they heard about their mates friends cousin hitting the big time.
634 2018-01-11 23:07:47 So I’m in Canada and our exchanges from fiat to crypto are limited. I’m holding Eth, BTC and LTC until my funds are off hold. My plan is to go after $neo $icx $zrx $ark once the price is right

639 2018-01-11 23:07:20 where is the new forbes interview ffs?
640 2018-01-11 23:07:12 Another major one is #Ada. They have a horrible marketing team compared to #XRP and #TRX with all the small announcements and hype. But their technology and team were the founders of #eth. But moved to ADA to fix many problems, one being scaling. #crypto
641 2018-01-11 23:07:05 Well, it looks like a reverse explosion !!
642 2018-01-11 23:07:04 Crypto vs amazon
643 2018-01-11 23:06:55 A huge benefit is its in Japan, where they love their crypto. As @JewKorean said in his video, lean on the side where less regulation is likely.
644 2018-01-11 23:06:50 Point is that it's significant they've turned around in public. This is bullish for Bitcoin and crypto in general. Wich is always a good thing.
645 2018-01-11 23:06:47 #Cryptocurrency 
Everything in red.

646 2018-01-11 23:06:47 What if there is a rumor (1) but no price increase, what will happen when it becomes news?

666 2018-01-11 23:05:24 Took part in a few upcoming ICO’s.  I see some potential with #fortknoxster, decided take a small stake in it.

674 2018-01-11 23:05:00 Nice speculative graph. Only way it’s going up is Korean are brought back in... I would stay away until market sentiment turns... not sure when that will be
675 2018-01-11 23:04:44 The real problem is the crypto miners. They buy all stock of whatever the fastest thing is. Make sense for them, but still.
676 2018-01-11 23:04:43 Lol  I don’t have much to say about this
677 2018-01-11 23:04:31 Correct me if im horribly  wrong, but in my view, with all the money yet to come into crypto, the only way for it to go is up. There will be big winners, and big losers, bit overall the trend is up. I mean... Binanace just reopened and has almost 200,000 new registrations already

682 2018-01-11 23:03:54 @ZaneWithSpoon Hey bro can i pm you re: what you think is a good writeup of basics to starting a crypto currency?
683 2018-01-11 23:03:53 Since starting this twitter I've focused on cryptocurrency. Crypto is the greatest asset that you or I may ever be apart of. Someone can enter with a few hundred and with a little study of the market, can transform that to thousands. But where do you go from there? real estate?

690 2018-01-11 23:03:23 Summers are not really great for crypto

692 2018-01-11 23:03:15 Why is the Association with Microsoft™ a meme?
693 2018-01-11 23:03:14 Love the #trx haters.  I can’t tell if they hate the idea/product or just crying that they missed the ship.  Which also makes no sense because it hasn’t even started yet.  I’m hearing some rumors that news coming out soon.
694 2018-01-11 23:03:13 I get your frustration and irony. It is very common for a lot of the ICOs to exclude the US market due to very complex security regulations.
695 2018-01-11 23:03:12 Cant wait. Yesterday's was fun, especially at the end, LOL
696 2018-01-11 23:03:12 Really bad idea and I am speaking from experience bro.
1. He tells everyone to go buy a coin, 
2. A week later the coin went up 15%
3. He sells and tells everyone to sell and brags about his calls in Twitter.
I have been doing better on my own. He knows nothing about Crypto

715 2018-01-11 23:02:10 $BTC at a very uncertain spot. Still lingering at the intersection of a long term support line and the current resistance line of the downtrend. Stay safe here. #Crypto
716 2018-01-11 23:01:49 Thank you Into Crypto for following me on Twitter!
717 2018-01-11 23:01:49 What is minting.? Think of it as interest. If you leave your Crypto in your wallet, you will get interest, and thus accrue more money. #TheMoreYouKnow
718 2018-01-11 23:01:48 I agree that the financial world is F'ed up, however I do not see another solution being implemented on the financial world by anyone else. @Ripple @AxionZachary
719 2018-01-11 23:01:46 Agreed, not all alt coins will vanish. Most all “tokens” will. But the key technical crypto coins (actual protocols) that are differentiated like #iOTA #XMR #ETH (or similar kinds) will remain. Others are fads riding the wave…though tide is low at the moment. #crypto #xrp
720 2018-01-11 23:01:41 I have a rule that if someone who knows nothing about crypto talks to me about an alt coin, I short it or sell, this worked perfectly with ripple 

“Hey what do you think about ripple? It’s up over $3!”
721 2018-01-11 23:01:33 @JonathanMH_com Not sure if you are doing this on purpose or not, but your website is taking 100% cpu mining crypto in javascript. Makes the website unusable.

751 2018-01-11 22:58:36 Crypto Miners are the reason my 1070 ti 8gb GPU amazon order has been pending since December 12, 2017. I bought it at $470 and prices have since soared nearly 200%. Guess I'll wait smh
752 2018-01-11 22:58:31 I tried to tell them to keep some money in reserve for their tax bill... hopefully the #ATO keeps track of crypto transactions! Why should crypto gambling be tax free compared to people investing in Australian equities?
753 2018-01-11 22:58:21 The whales are shaking your hands, hold your $XZC or regret. It is a usual thing in crypto after sudden rise in 4H, the whales will sell off to trigger panic sell.
754 2018-01-11 22:58:16 Re Bitcoin: "The survival rate of cryptocurrencies is low" (here is the data) Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Monero (XMR) are the headline grabbers for crypto
(there are others of
course, forgive me if i have left out your favourite).
755 2018-01-11 22:58:15 I think just found the holy grail of making fast cash with crypto. 
If you are a content creator you are going to love this!
756 2018-01-11 22:58:13 Indeed it is. All the newbies and amateurs who joined in from all the hype are leaving…and taking their losses. It’s sad, they need to see the real value #XRP is offering and many others. It’s a long road ahead for those who can hold…not hodl #ripple #TRX #crypto
757 2018-01-11 22:58:08 Going to see how fast it gets there. I’m prepared to wait a few months to hit 90sats if it doesn’t blow up right away but if it gets there quick, I’ll set the sell order a lot higher!
758 2018-01-11 22:58:07 Hey Talk Crypto To Me thanks for the follow!
759 2018-01-11 22:58:07 I'm creating a new crypto currency called "A Tuition"
760 2018-01-11 22:57:57 i hope theyre working on getting on another exchange. im surprised a coin like linda has zipped passed kin. kin is way better.
761 2018-01-11 22:57:51 When looking to buy alts during downswings.. always look at sats never price. Price might be down because of btc but when sats are down from weak hands that’s when you swoop in.
If you’re unsure, be patient and focus on coins that are staples $neo $ltc $bcc $eth
762 2018-01-11 22:57:49 HUGE walls at 400sats. Gonna take a while to break that
763 2018-01-11 22:57:49 People's bank of china??
764 2018-01-11 22:57:43 Stole, its theft and the whole crypto community is just sitting back like “GLAD ITS NOT ME” professional representation please for these poor people. Again bad actors ruin it for us all. DAMM!!!
765 2018-01-11 22:57:41 The problem is that crypto currencies are more popular than they are mature. The ETH and BTC networks are both (more or less) maxed out. Even 2nd layer solutions don't solve everything. Lightning needs one on-chain tx – this priced out the 3rd world.
766 2018-01-11 22:57:38 Hi oh here we go again BTC ... R.I.P my portfolio lol
767 2018-01-11 22:57:33 @honzazeli  No problem, friend. I love to help people out in the crypto space. 

@bbands Mr Bollinger, are the Billinger walls the only tool you use when you are trading? Or do you also use other tools like the ichimoku clouds (I like to use both)
768 2018-01-11 22:57:28 Gotcha, agree. I’m always shocked how often I agree with you given how different we think about a number of things. Except on crypto. I just nod a lot when you speak there.

772 2018-01-11 22:56:51 Damn this #crypto game has become more like a 24hour #pennystock Prices of #cryptocurrency will never rise if we dont use it for its purpose. Selling and trading was never the purpose of decentralized #cryptocurrencies
773 2018-01-11 22:56:50 Added 1mm kin
774 2018-01-11 22:56:50 Honestly can’t decide if it’s truly a crypto or a solution. Quicker is better in the institutional finance industry. Near real time settlement could be very profitable and highly desirable. Worth watching and playing with as long as u can handle a full loss of your investment
775 2018-01-11 22:56:46 I dont watch tv until comcast takes crypto hahaha

785 2018-01-11 22:56:01 $UIS is a growing beast. Only 46mil supply, and still under 10cents. Could follow the steps of $VTC and be a $5 coin someday. The marketing is getting more proactive, and community is growing fast. New exchanges on the way.
786 2018-01-11 22:55:52 Home made crypto is also always snake oil.
Use standard and well known cipher, or be snake oil too.
787 2018-01-11 22:55:49 Let’s do better and not lettin us get fucked by mainstream media fake news. Paid by the governments to scare us away from the evil crypto market

791 2018-01-11 22:55:28 $NEO is holding up surprisingly well in this market tho. Everyone who experienced the 30% dips in the past when bitcoin coughed will agree. This makes me bullish on $NEO.

Also all these ICOs are coming up. There are so many that i cant even remember all of them.

$crypto
792 2018-01-11 22:55:11 Taking a real #crypto beating. Feels like I'm being smacked around with a bag full if these ALT coins. Decided to change my trading strategy once these things bounce. #cryptocurrency #bitcoin #Ethereum #HODL #HODLsquad #fml #
793 2018-01-11 22:55:10 I don't need documentation to say « snake oil ».
Show your code. Or be snake oil.
Real crypto can't be closed source.
794 2018-01-11 22:55:03 Like it or not it will overtake bitcoin as the number 1 crypto currency it will never be at the price as bitcoin but it can easily reach 200 dollars if it overtakes swift
795 2018-01-11 22:54:59 $XP best deal in the top 100.
796 2018-01-11 22:54:53 Thanks for sharing mate!

798 2018-01-11 22:54:45 I’m in a similar situation. My bags aren’t in $bch and $xrp but I have limited funds. I feel like this is one I will regret if I don’t get in. Lots of sexier coins with extreme growth short term but $bat is solid
799 2018-01-11 22:54:43 戻りつつあるXRPに笑

800 2018-01-11 22:54:14 c est a cause de fdp comme vous que Verge et Trx se crash.
801 2018-01-11 22:54:12 Unfortunately, that's true - US citizens can't participate.
802 2018-01-11 22:54:00 Shoulda left crypto alone 
803 2018-01-11 22:53:59 His rule was to not trade crypto...
804 2018-01-11 22:53:43 wondering @CoryTV why there's been no crypto-craze surrounding $DISH - they've been accepting $BTC since 2014
805 2018-01-11 22:53:41 So will the fast food market be the early adopters of crypto? We all love a bargain bucket in the early hours while staring at our screens!
806 2018-01-11 22:53:38 la Nasa? looooool
807 2018-01-11 22:53:38 I can't.....
808 2018-01-11 22:53:34 I wouldn't say crypto has gotten to shoe shine boy shill level yet
809 2018-01-11 22:53:34 a crypto currency, but for nipples.
810 2018-01-11 22:53:28 People should vet their news sources…there’s dozens of crypto news sites and I’ve seen some pretty legit looking sites post fake news.
811 2018-01-11 22:53:20 Breakthrough moment guys. I think i've finally become immune to seeing Bitcoin drop... Just sat here, carying on with work, big red candles on my screen to the left and I'm barely even caring. Screw you FUD monkeys!  #bitcoin #btc #fud
812 2018-01-11 22:53:14 Lisk forked Cryptsy, and then Ark forked Lisk, and now @AriseBank forked the Ark wallet! But somehow only one is a scam?
813 2018-01-11 22:53:12 they are doing a coin burn soon so maybe that will  raise the price

816 2018-01-11 22:52:25 How can you invest in this while not being an "accredited investor"
817 2018-01-11 22:52:25 word on the "street" is that people (some) are getting scared of weed, think crypto still has legs, as earlier days
818 2018-01-11 22:52:25 But of course if a couple of heavy announcements are made in the meantime we could hit $10 by the end of May. You never know in Crypto land. If announcements keep coming though there will be a “open floodgates” moment and the price will jump significantly, possibly even double!
819 2018-01-11 22:52:25 Software developer who does not get graph theory. Lol. Lol. Obviously you are a self taught visual basic developer without a computer science degree.
820 2018-01-11 22:52:24 Wallstreet is gonna hit #crypto hard and not in a good way. Look what happened one week after futures trading was allowed if want an idea of wallstreet sense of humor
821 2018-01-11 22:52:22 uh oh, looks like @Crypto_Bitlord got lost on his way back from the moon! We're going to have to re-schedule this one. Apologies! We'll let you know as soon as we have a new date and time
822 2018-01-11 22:52:17 S. Korean Corrupt government can try bringing this industry down. Wish you success S.Korea because Crypto is here to stay for the greater benefit of humanity against OLIGARCHY!!
823 2018-01-11 22:52:14 The standard world currencies are like Cryptocurrencies in that they are not based on any form of real value. However, Crypto currency has a kind of Crypto scarcity so perversely it is more valuable than Dollars or Pounds. Confidence and scarcity = an asset bubble!

834 2018-01-11 22:51:38 It tanked? You mean ethereum is up like 30% in the past week and 300% in the last month? If you knew anything about crypto you would know most currencies swing an easy 10% every day.  You are unbelievably deceptive for a "journalist".
835 2018-01-11 22:51:31 it's the 8th largest crypto by market cap, get a grip
836 2018-01-11 22:51:22 This thing is going to the ditch
837 2018-01-11 22:51:11 I’m just saying if liquidity disappears whether stock market/crypto crashes exchanges will have a hard time

842 2018-01-11 22:50:54 I concur with that quote
843 2018-01-11 22:50:50 still remember when that first one exploded - almost all of my topline limit sells had been cleared out - damnit forced to rebuy 

when 1k sats is broken its going to be a challenge to think of that short duration of sub 100 sats $BURST
844 2018-01-11 22:50:39 Questions still remain. Would you like it to work? Wouldnt it be a cool thing?

892 2018-01-11 22:45:55 *At least one connection*. Would you like it to work? Wouldnt it be a cool thing?
893 2018-01-11 22:45:49 If you build a coin to kill another coin, you're building a weapon out of evil intent.Your intention was not building a technology that is going to be beneficial to the greater crypto world.  For that your coin will fail because the motivation is all wrong.
894 2018-01-11 22:45:46 I've previously made capital gains on shares and paid a very high tax rate, which dampened my enthusiasm in investing. Hey #ATO, why is it that my friends are quadrupling their money and making capital gains in under 12 months on crypto currency and yet pay zero #CGT?

900 2018-01-11 22:45:30 Something, anything - is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it. Worth and value are made up concoctions created by humans. I'm not bullish on crypto either, but it shows the foundations of how wealth, value, worth, and status are created; it's created out of thin air.
901 2018-01-11 22:45:30 Wow this #FUD again...it doesn't work. Somebody's already used it back when the price stuggled to break .25 cents. If you're in crypto long enough you realize that price movements are cyclical you buy in and wait your turn. #XRP

915 2018-01-11 22:44:10 Will Cryptocurrency destroy financial institutions, government and society as a whole. The internet has already had a massive affect in these areas and enabled what could be very damaging crypto currencies which undermine everything we understand about how our country is governed
916 2018-01-11 22:44:03 before closing and blocking the site without saying anything. It's trading not playing at something else.. I'm manager, I think I know what I'm telling about :)
917 2018-01-11 22:44:03 Lol, crypto stands for cryptography, which is a discipline of computer science. CS is the base for everything that is and that is to come in crypto currency (programming) projects.
918 2018-01-11 22:44:02 And I hear the dev for $swaptoken got caught molesting collies. Pretty  sick. I wouldn't buy that coin.

936 2018-01-11 22:42:28 if this is true, then blockchain and all crypto-concepts are naturally worthless
937 2018-01-11 22:42:27 I'm no expert, but my view is any digital currency with some sort of cryptographic technology is a crypto currency. Ripple is centralized, but it's still a cryptocurrency nonetheless. I don't like it much, same as the current blockstream devs controlled Bitcoin....

957 2018-01-11 22:41:09 When I was wiring money to my exchange, the tellers were on the edge of their seat as I told them about crypto currency. No pie in the sky stories, just calm talk about another investment strategy available to go with others. You can bet they were checking it out that night.

961 2018-01-11 22:41:01 Its quite an interesting topic. As time goes by, it May become more risky to invest in conventional stocks rather than crypto, as crypto becoming main stream.

1003 2018-01-11 22:37:29 How many of these events is it going to take for you guys to realize that they are highly involved and in bed with the big bankers, the exact people that Bitcoin and cryptocurrency was trying to escape from?  Better to learn now and Ride The Wave, or step aside.
1004 2018-01-11 22:37:25 I hate this corporate induced fake news crap. South Korea is not banning crypto but addressing regulation. Low and behold ripple announced new deal on same day. Don't touch ripple. Poisoned crypto.

1011 2018-01-11 22:36:58 Bitcoin (BTC) can process ~3-7 tx per sec due to artificial 1 MB limits (less than a floppy disk). These limits apparently prevent decentralization.

Yet I can not even receive 1 Satoshi without being connected to a highly centralized hub ..

1026 2018-01-11 22:36:01 I thought most countries had smartphones. With an app you could send any crypto worldwide with only a miner's fee. To me it seems that (banks and) services like moneygram/western union are antiquated and within a generation will be obsolete.

1031 2018-01-11 22:35:18 I believe EViL GOVERNMENT started BiTCOIN
when BiTCOIN is worth BiLLIONS they'll shut it down offering a bailout.
rescuing CRYPTO investors a small % of their money to switch to their GOVT.SAViOR called FEDCOIN and see FiAT DiSAPPEAR while GOVT. PROFiTS and looks like a HERO
1032 2018-01-11 22:35:16 You must pay taxes for crypto currency, but you can't pay your taxes with crypto currency cause it has no value.
1033 2018-01-11 22:35:10 CNBC crew all over the map on Crypto and pumping coins
1034 2018-01-11 22:35:08 I like how you never gave out crypto for the first 5000 people to follow you on FollowCoin.... why did you lie?
1035 2018-01-11 22:35:08 @TravWeav One more senior developer from #Alibaba just joined the #TRON team. Led by Lucien Chen, we began to have a very strong developer team from great companies. #TRX $TRX
1036 2018-01-11 22:35:06 guys don't be full and buy #XRP ! Currently (XRP / ETH 0.00162) it is artificially kept low. Buy it before rocket gets up.

1038 2018-01-11 22:34:59 One crypto currency at a time.
1039 2018-01-11 22:34:49 @ThePinkCrypto I hope we both find success. The market is large enough. I will say however that to accomplish something as an ecommerce, crypto platform is a tall order. Something that took SAFEX a year and a half to do. I’d be more than happy to share with you why we hit$1 soon
1040 2018-01-11 22:34:48 Be Calm and Dont Sell Your #Bitcoin.  The market is bearish due to #FUD and misinformation via #SouthKorea & rumors that the US will be creating regulations soon.  I’m sure #crypto will recover.  I’m the meantime BUY THE CHEAP #COINS!  #ripple #litecoin #ethereum #cryptocurrency
1041 2018-01-11 22:34:46 その通り。WETHつくるよ。ETHがERC20トークンにぺぐされた奴。
1042 2018-01-11 22:34:40 You could always move all of your funds over to a free Robinhood stock trading account, I know they often see one hundred percent breakouts there on a daily basis. 
1043 2018-01-11 22:34:37 Thanks cuz!

1047 2018-01-11 22:34:20 Yes. You buy 1000 coins in March it will be swapped for 1 coin so they'll be 3,438,481,853 coins
1048 2018-01-11 22:34:15 Siacoin is seriously so undervalued. #Siacoin #cryptocurrency #bitcoin #crypto #bittrex $SC
1049 2018-01-11 22:34:09 Spankchain is probably the worlds most sexy crypto-token. That alone should be argument enough to buy some. :) #SpankChain #crypto
1050 2018-01-11 22:34:07 "I feel like" isn't something you should say when dealing with #Crypto. Look at the charts and observe #XVG's constant grow. "Isn't going anywhere", did you really expect something like 5$ by now, or what?

1056 2018-01-11 22:33:29 @CoinCards new updates are exactly what we need in the $Crypto space. Segwit addresses, ability to upgrade to LN when available and #Litecoin payments. This is how we need to see companies do upgrades to further our space!

1059 2018-01-11 22:33:09 Yes you can, but if you combine bitcoin and it's forks, bitcoin can process ~50 tx per sec. If bitcoin community aims for World-wide adoption this is not going to cut it. VISA does >4k per sec. 2nd layer solutions are absolutely mandatory.
1060 2018-01-11 22:33:07 Something has changed with the #crypto market..  There are so many in the with scared money we can’t get any movement. From 30 days ago till today it’s a whole different world. The only way to make money is be lucky enough to have inside info on coin listings. #xrp #Binance

If you create a new group for Crypto de’ N00bici, I’ll pay to join. 

Don’t know how to read these lol.
1072 2018-01-11 22:32:11 I’m just shocked that a smart person can be so confident about a subject they know so little about. I, too, love crypto. That doesn’t mean that economists aren’t good at fiat.
1073 2018-01-11 22:32:10 Just had to sneak that coin in there 
1074 2018-01-11 22:32:08 You can invest incryptocurrencies, unlike an IPO, WITH AN IPO YOU MUST HAVE $250,000.00 or have made 30 trades over 3 months..regular folk can get in on the ground floor with crypto currencies. And make millions in a few years. YIKES! Say old rich white men
1075 2018-01-11 22:32:07 Lol
1076 2018-01-11 22:32:07 What happens in the event of a mass exodus, should it come, on all these budding crypto exchanges? Do they have the funds to cover it? I am seriously skeptical. Super exciting market and fun to watch/play small in - but I question the long-term integrity of these places for now.

1090 2018-01-11 22:31:09 I can receive money 24/7 all-year with Bitcoin

* without paying anything
* without being online
* without having to turn off my firewall
1091 2018-01-11 22:31:08 $LUX is not a bad shout. 
1092 2018-01-11 22:30:58 I used to do that actually. But I assumed if I wanted to do full time forever I should learn proper technique. Eventually the crypto market will “stabilize” and be closer to the forex market. So I studied forex trading patterns and indicators
1093 2018-01-11 22:30:50 you should probably stick with that...3 weeks ago you made a statement about an already super volatile market, followed by further bad news out of Korea/China/etc. causing a correction and now you're bragging about it? Wow...pure genius! is their a crypto noble prize yet?
1094 2018-01-11 22:30:47 Bitcoin is money, and it actually has value as opposed to the fake money the FED has unconstitutionaly impossed on us since 1913. Learn history, then learn #crypto, you may survive the collapse of the fiat system.
1095 2018-01-11 22:30:41 HODL
1096 2018-01-11 22:30:40 Dude! People in the crypto space can learn from your actions! You are a super awesome inspiration!!
1097 2018-01-11 22:30:38 That's the question. Everyone is talking about #trx #tron and #XVG . I feel like since #Vergecurrency only dropped after releasing #WraithProtocol this coin isn't going anywhere IMO.
1098 2018-01-11 22:30:34 よーし今日は何買いますかね。IYRKも少ししとくか

1101 2018-01-11 22:30:29 The recent #cryptonewbie storyline: 

1) Ignore friends telling you to invest for months
2) Prices soar late Dec, #FOMO ensues, buy at ATH's 
3) Natural market dip occurs, #panicselling turns rampant 
4) Money lost 
5) Faith in $crypto lost

Bull cycles begins. #FOMO. Repeat.

1104 2018-01-11 22:30:16 @justinsuntron take notes from this
1105 2018-01-11 22:30:16 i always read vcs as version control system when lowercase. now that we have crypto, git is out.
1106 2018-01-11 22:30:15 Wat u mean so they r reducing the total amount?
1107 2018-01-11 22:30:12 Yes! WTF IS THAT? I was literally screaming. They are going to lose business, bc I am 1000% leaving.
1108 2018-01-11 22:30:01 Thank you for addressing xvg
1109 2018-01-11 22:29:49 Ahhhh sorry man, didn't see the Crypto news! Was late to this one but now I see why you are so insanely bullish! Totally agree with you! $DSCR WOWIE
1110 2018-01-11 22:29:40 Crypto payments is always in time. A simple idea but can be powerful. Good luck to team
1111 2018-01-11 22:29:39 Same for phone / internet. If someone does not pay for a phone number / internet subscription / register an email address they cannot receive phone calls / emails, but people go thru all that hassle in order to be CONNECTED because at the end it makes their lives easier.
1112 2018-01-11 22:29:36 Coin swap coming soon 1000:1 ratio

1122 2018-01-11 22:28:48 If a reporter has a conflict of interest like owning crypto and covering crypto. What would you call bitcoin devs that own companies that are directly involved with bitcoin?

1144 2018-01-11 22:27:11 Thanks to all who chimed in to say coins won’t be sent. .   #blessed   Its a Big Fast Scary world out there.  So Thank god im out the crypto game now. Got a letter in the mail today said I just won $5,000,000 !  just gotta send a check for $1,200 bank fees and I get my $$$
1145 2018-01-11 22:27:09 I think it's easy to find historical precedent to fit any agenda, the reality is far less clear. The platitude of history rhyming but not repeating itself is most apt in crypto
1146 2018-01-11 22:26:50 @jaltucherFake, phoney!  There are kids that made fortunes on crypto.  Big damn deal.  Dont pretend to be a guru.  You got in at the early stage and made a fortune like Many others. Good for you but dont pretend to be expert.  There are none!
1147 2018-01-11 22:26:49 There's an interesting aside here on the law governing exchanges (in Britain). An 1845 law treated many txs as unenforceable gambling contracts in order to foster within exchange reputation-based enforcement. So maybe what crypto needs is an exemption from contract law.

1155 2018-01-11 22:26:03 Am I wrong or does that graph show it’s a bit behind schedule just curious huge tron fan.
1156 2018-01-11 22:25:58 Which should raise prices not lower them idiots trading crypto these days
1157 2018-01-11 22:25:56 One week in crypto and I’ve experienced more emotion than all of 2017. Fuck yeah. #cryptotwitter #bitcoin #altcoins $ENJ $KMD $DRGN
1158 2018-01-11 22:25:30 That's very different from lacking the capability to suppress CCs. Some blockchain advocates seem to think there's literally no way a government can prevent people from using crypto-currency to replace standard currencies.

They're wrong.
1159 2018-01-11 22:25:25 Not sure, the BBC and the CIA are only a few letters apart. I Am The Walrus was about the crypto eugenics that John realized he was a tool of. Monty Python was also pushed to pervert us.

1161 2018-01-11 22:25:17 Yep. All buying crypto will be crippled.
1162 2018-01-11 22:25:13 Agreed! What is also not helping is all those exchanges closing registrations or being slow due to new regulations, KYC/AML requirements and just sheer amount of new users being introduced to crypto! Atomic Swaps will change the game!

1172 2018-01-11 22:24:17 so crypto twitter shills rubbish as food instead of rubbish as smart investment, sounds normal.
1173 2018-01-11 22:24:14 Acho que vc que entendeu errado: as publicações são nossas, feitas pela casa (e nao da casa, feitas por nós). Vc tb é livre pra não concordar, mas é impossível ignorar que existe essa discussão no mundo (crypto rules vs. crypto sux)
1174 2018-01-11 22:24:09 Lmao Ronnie Moas does nothing to deserve being a big name in crypto.
1175 2018-01-11 22:24:06 
1176 2018-01-11 22:24:01 Actually he was first bitcoin adopter not satoshi according with his post in 2013 on bitcointalk
1177 2018-01-11 22:23:58 $LINX market cap only 12million and sitting at 492 rank on coin market cap...... This year could be the year I retire $btc $eth #Crypto
1178 2018-01-11 22:23:50 Prices are way crazy right now. Would advise to wait a bit till the crypto bubble potentially pops :P

1180 2018-01-11 22:23:44 I don't need to pay money to receive money in Bitcoin ...
1181 2018-01-11 22:23:44 The Bitcoin codebase is currently being improved a lot: 

- #LightningNetwork 
- #CT ( $PART, $LTC )
- #RingCT ( $PART )
- #MAST 
- #AtomicSwaps ( $DCR, $BTC, $VTC, $PART, $LTC )

I am sure many more are being research right now! This is going to be an exciting year in crypto!
1182 2018-01-11 22:23:38 Same goes with Jamie Dimon who regret calling bitcoin a fraud.  He too did not understand cryptocurrency and he is beginning to become educated about the crypto world.
1183 2018-01-11 22:23:30 Invest in crypto while you can, South Korea is already trying to ban it bc their people aren’t paying taxes or some shit lmao
1184 2018-01-11 22:23:26 @MichaelSuppo @boxmining Fortuna is solving the current issue of OTC Derivative market! Even if there’s a fall in crypto market, I think this one will change the OTC market forever. Hope you guys talk about this on your channel 
1185 2018-01-11 22:23:19 @kfc_canada gets a follow for joining crypto! #KFCrypto
1186 2018-01-11 22:23:07 Thoughts on the upcoming Senate meeting on crypto
1187 2018-01-11 22:23:06 $xcp lookin nice
1188 2018-01-11 22:23:04 Do you like Ripple? I was in at .80 got out at $1.70 Then bought again at $3.00, so I am now still ahead from my first go, but not happy at the last ones I bought.
1189 2018-01-11 22:22:59 The current correction in the digital asset class space, although nerve racking, is a really quite healthy. Consider it a moment of pause and reflection.
1190 2018-01-11 22:22:59 You need to open a channel you #bcash tard. What do you imagine? You do nothing and mailman brings you 1 satoshi?
1191 2018-01-11 22:22:58 Latin America is ready for the B2B crypto world. Utemis has an excellent white paper, a real world vision and a solid team. Latin America is catching on to crypto real quick. Utemis will lead the way. I believe Utemis will make it happen really big!
1192 2018-01-11 22:22:54 Thanks
1193 2018-01-11 22:22:51 Peer information in Lightning is pubkey@IP:Port - is that what you mean by URI?
1194 2018-01-11 22:22:48 @JimBTC do your thing please..!!!
1195 2018-01-11 22:22:46 What about crypto? I'd think every college kid will be out of school and have plenty of time to trade then
1196 2018-01-11 22:22:46 How bout this. Crypto Crosswords
1197 2018-01-11 22:22:42 Prior to using binance and kucoin, do you use coinbase to buy coin with usd? Any other places that you use usd to buy crypto?
1198 2018-01-11 22:22:42 U can explain why panda coin is good altcoin?
1199 2018-01-11 22:22:41 Man that's fucked! Was looking into MN a little bit last night. Feeling that while a bit of the crypto market has lost its lustre though a bit of MN'ing might be a good bit of coin if you get the right one!
1200 2018-01-11 22:22:38 @cnbc about to talk about a great crypto to buy but find out which one within the hour......c'mon #XRP
1201 2018-01-11 22:22:38 I'm a crypto-genius
1202 2018-01-11 22:22:37 I used to listen to so many podcasts before I got into crypto
1203 2018-01-11 22:22:26 怒った？
1204 2018-01-11 22:22:25 sign me up. i want to get in on the pre sale
1205 2018-01-11 22:22:18 Crypto als systeem is interessant, maar om in tokens te beleggen zou ik vrienden afraden. Cryptomunten kunnen oneindig geforkt worden, dus cryptoschaarste is fake, en waarde van een ruileenheid is ook bijzaak. Gaat om ruilen zelf, niet de waarde van de munt. Ponzi pruis, get out.
1206 2018-01-11 22:22:17 Well looking at the #pac graph It's bottomed out and about to break bullish. So good news if you can easily buy it

1211 2018-01-11 22:22:01 $ODN very undervalued and on topic with the coming telegram ICO. Give the people what they want. $ODN MUCH WOW!
1212 2018-01-11 22:21:56 Talked about #crypto with some friends last night.  They were talking about $XRP, $TRX, $ETH, $ADA, $NEO and everything else.  

Funny thing though..  NO ONE MENTIONED BITCOIN FOR 2 HOURS.

1214 2018-01-11 22:21:48 Ok big guy. Ok.
1215 2018-01-11 22:21:46 Isn’t there some crazy hard fork in the making so that we can go “it’s raining coins hallelujah” apeshit mode again...
1216 2018-01-11 22:21:41 For a second o thought Google was jumping on the #crypto boat. Had to read it again.
1217 2018-01-11 22:21:39 It was Pumped :) #PumpAndDump
1218 2018-01-11 22:21:31 Fanboyism Fund
A new crypto currency employing behaviour characteristic of fanboys; blind, aggressive devotion.
1219 2018-01-11 22:21:26 Oh, and how about fact that yet ANOTHER GOP Rep, @DarrellIssa is now conveniently retiring? Yet ANOTHER Millionaire GOP house member who is jumping ship, now that they got their tax bill in place. Say bye-bye in mid-term you lying piece of crap.
1220 2018-01-11 22:21:18 Patience is key
1221 2018-01-11 22:21:18 I'm up nearly 18.5x my total investment in #crypto by trading, not investing. I know zero about #blockchain, the technology behind any crypto & have no fundamental knowledge. For those of you who say TA does not work are 100% wrong. This is perfect example it works in any market.
1222 2018-01-11 22:21:11 So let me get this straight ... To receive less than 1 cent I need to

1.) Give you my IP address
2.) Turn off my firewall
3.) or pay money
1223 2018-01-11 22:21:10 My bank really told me I couldn’t buy crypto currency because I could be funding terrorism
1224 2018-01-11 22:21:03 Ok. I've had enough is this. I'm going to get a coffee and do something productive lol.
1225 2018-01-11 22:20:56 $etc What a great 5 months 300%  up this is a nice investment for long terms..#crypto #ada #trx #eng Never invest with money with you not can miss!!
For young traders invest only in coins where you in believe for long investment. Don t buy in a pump... Don t sell in a dip!
1226 2018-01-11 22:20:55 So Williams to win it is then....
1227 2018-01-11 22:20:54 Same
1228 2018-01-11 22:20:47 A simple curve fit will not include competing assets, like other crypto currencies. But there are some nice things to think about. The "birth" of bitcoins is regulated to a constant rate. The death can be estimated from the article on how many are lost.
1229 2018-01-11 22:20:45 @noamlevenson Hey Noam, just following up. Can you please check DM? (for writing about crypto on my blog) Thanks :)
1230 2018-01-11 22:20:40 @Haejin_Crypto have you ever applied your crypto analytics to google trends? I’ve seen others suggest a correlation between google searches and crypto
1231 2018-01-11 22:20:36 I am having the same problem. You can get a mobile version on the website but its not the same. It’s terrible, really slow and prices lag. (No it’s not my internet connection)
1232 2018-01-11 22:20:36 If you just caught that $LUX dip... Congrats!

1233 2018-01-11 22:20:25 Not a problem, brother.
1234 2018-01-11 22:20:02 2018 and the finance industry is doing good. So much for crypto destroying the banks.
1235 2018-01-11 22:19:56 Guys buy ZCL , it's gonna HF with BTC to create bitcoin private, a bitcoin with Zcash privacy features. It's mooning and fork date has not been announced yet!You'll get same amount for holding ZCL and/or BTC(both 1:1). last week zcl was 260$ now about 180!! #ZCL #bitcoin #Crypto
1236 2018-01-11 22:19:49 Ahah there's no perfect world but there's a good reason you can connect to a lot of nodes.
1237 2018-01-11 22:19:35 It does not matter. You didn't say anything about that in your initial tweet. We just want to see if 1 satoshi can be sent. So URI please.
1238 2018-01-11 22:19:35 The crypto market agreed with The Oracle
1239 2018-01-11 22:19:29 Banks don't even use the coin, pimple faced teenage Crypto traders do.....
1240 2018-01-11 22:19:27 Next thing you ask me to turn off my firewall so you can actually connect to my node ... Right?
1241 2018-01-11 22:19:27 Im on the rocket ready for take off lol
1242 2018-01-11 22:19:27 Or they are launching a new crypto... Dropcoin
1243 2018-01-11 22:19:25 I have registered on the site, where do you claim?
1244 2018-01-11 22:19:20 Ripple's not a crypto currency, xrp is a centralized crypto (optionally) used by ripple.
1245 2018-01-11 22:19:11 Hey Bobby,  been following your work for awhile.  Great work! I’m not going to the Miami one but I’m going to the blockchain connect conference in SF. Thinking about tokenfest in March.

1251 2018-01-11 22:18:48 Maybe next time 
1252 2018-01-11 22:18:44 Sure thing. No doubt that the Executives will be giving themselves very nice special bonuses and pay increases. Now, how about the 215 workers at Carrier who got laid off today? Remember, Carrier? That company you gave the tax break to.

1282 2018-01-11 22:16:11 I am sure he said the same thing about the internet, maybe it’s time to retire.
This quote he said sums it all up
“why in the world should I take a long or short position in something I don’t know anything about?”
That right he knows nothing about Crypto

1291 2018-01-11 22:15:35 What an embarrassing display of bad journalism. To write an article on the incredible potential of atomic swaps to change crypto without mentioning #barterdex, #komodo, is a major omission. You can do better than this @coindesk

I found better ones since.. Still buying
1302 2018-01-11 22:14:55 That would be awesome. Central exchanges have become way to powerful. Decentralisation is necessary to keep crypto alive. Else history will repeat itself.

1312 2018-01-11 22:14:26 Only Crypto being used in the real world environment outside of people/companies holding it. excluding Bitcoin and Litecoin as payment options on some platforms.  Why be mad that they took an alternitive route and are becoming successful as time goes on, its good for cryptoworld
1313 2018-01-11 22:14:18 if you have just 30.000 eur of all capital were you invest right now in penny stocks or crypto?

1320 2018-01-11 22:13:56 @officialmcafee what do you think the potential of a crypto like @electroneum is with not only desktop miners but there own app with a mobile miner and wallet built into the app?
1321 2018-01-11 22:13:49 J'ai lu qu'il faut disposer d'ordinateurs assez puissants (d'après l'article, un core i7 ne ferait pas l'affaire) pour miner de la crypto monnaie, et surtout du bitcoin.
1322 2018-01-11 22:13:48 Aye. Good luck mate.
1323 2018-01-11 22:13:44 I opened my crypto activity in Dec. with a bank card dep on CB. On 01/06, I linked a bank account and made an ACH dep at GDAX. Now I find out that money won't be available until 01/17. Would it be worth it to make another bank card deposit ($28 fee) to get in on the fire sale?
1324 2018-01-11 22:13:41 You're welcome mate! Thanks 
1325 2018-01-11 22:13:34 To the moon @myriadcoin

You’re welcome 
1328 2018-01-11 22:13:22 偉そうに。
1329 2018-01-11 22:13:21 It will. For sure. Patience
1330 2018-01-11 22:13:19 Not treating you as an authority due to not knowing who the heck you are is not “character assassination,” minor or otherwise. If you are in a position to know more about crypto currency than other people and you want that known, maybe put something about it in your profile.
1331 2018-01-11 22:13:17 I'm making this my official trading song.
1332 2018-01-11 22:13:14 Crypto investing is the veganism of economics haha Kaj mislite, kdo bo prej povedal, da je a) vegan b) crypto trader c) into crossfit
1333 2018-01-11 22:13:09 You mentioned that once and I still have trouble taking any credit because I really don't nearly as much as the other guys, but you're a good guy, so thank you!

1340 2018-01-11 22:12:43 Well done to China for the fair play ie giving time to miners to relocate.  Energy is the number one issue in #crypto atm.. addressing and solving it will boost the market to unprecedented levels.

1354 2018-01-11 22:11:58 Anytime my friend! You are one of the guys on here that I have learned a lot from when I first started on Twitter so thanks mate! Along with @notsofast who I recommend everyone follow as well.

1357 2018-01-11 22:11:41 crypto twitter is providing massive free viral exposure to a gross corporation shilling rubbish sold as food.
1358 2018-01-11 22:11:40 Is this in any way related to your silence about your red headed step child Xvg?
1359 2018-01-11 22:11:37 @mcuban Can you please give us an update about your involvement in @UnikoinGold #UKG $UKG as of the present and future? Go Mavs! PS I'm going to use my #bitcoin and #dogecoin to buy the Mavs from you one day #cryptocurrency #crypto #BTC #investing #sharktank @ABCSharkTank
1360 2018-01-11 22:11:33 It's very disappointing seeing some of the people I respect on social media add to the market FUD. This is not a crash. Most coins, including #Bitcoin aren't even at 2 week lows. Instead of adding to the fear, show more confidence for the sake of your viewers/readers!

1361 2018-01-11 22:11:27 @typesfast are you building a crypto portfolio?
1362 2018-01-11 22:11:23 Why is everything still down after this??
1363 2018-01-11 22:11:16 Just in time for the Korean ban? .  Need to get on Binance.

1366 2018-01-11 22:10:59 Once you open a channel with another node, that node can relay payments to other nodes that have channels with it, etc. You're not connected to anyone so obviously I can't send you anything.
1367 2018-01-11 22:10:53 調べてないんですか？
1368 2018-01-11 22:10:47 Come on now @BBCOS reporting that South Korea banned BTC at 9:21pm  (GMT) after the story had been fully researched and proven to be nothing like the earlier speculation (which you went with btw).  You have the resources you can do better. For shame.
1369 2018-01-11 22:10:47 The way some speak of #Crypto. I doubt they would know if it’s up 50% then down 50% would that be overall up, down or evens

1379 2018-01-11 22:10:11 one intriguing aspect of the crypto market is that there is no market open and close, it is always on. No gaps in the open :)

1385 2018-01-11 22:09:58 You know been in crypto currencies for a few years now, one thing is clear, the commentators #cnbc and #Bloomberg get, makes me realize how horribly out of touch they are, and how bad their reporting must be on stocks and bonds, ignore them.
1386 2018-01-11 22:09:56 wanna have anxiety. Be too poor to invest in crypto
1387 2018-01-11 22:09:53 Seriously, not just shining your ass. You're one of the best in all of crypto twitter.
1388 2018-01-11 22:09:47 #Crypto should stay unregulated as a living exhibit of what a market fully powered by animal spirits red in tooth and claw is really like.
1389 2018-01-11 22:09:47 Just saw someone sell 4, and then 2 $trx with market sales. WTF.

Where can you buy crypto with quarters?
1390 2018-01-11 22:09:41 You can do the same with Linda coin and it's faster. :)

1392 2018-01-11 22:09:37 Yes, btc keeps interrupting its progress. Keep up the great analysis.
1393 2018-01-11 22:09:34 I started with forex and moved into crypto after being a crypto investor for a while.
Lots to learn still.
I'm just a regular guy studying natural sciences in university right now.
1394 2018-01-11 22:09:34 Let's be honest. 
The biggest altcoin winners of 2018 so far are the madmen who accumulated absolute dogshit in dogetoshi and litoshi markets and sold the coins in double digit satoshis to the biggest fools crypto has seen so far.

1433 2018-01-11 22:06:38 Im not a full time crypto guy. Im a stock trader RIA. Trust me bitcoin cant handle the volume we trade. Stocks are a way better game than crypto! Crypto is like a speculative tech investment. #bitcoin But i got involved 3 years ago and would never pay $14k for a bitcoin.

1438 2018-01-11 22:06:15 I’m blown away by blockchain technology. “The blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record... virtually everything of value.” —Don & Alex Tapscott. Crypto currency opinions aside, blockchain increases accountability.
1439 2018-01-11 22:06:12 Absolutely not, obviously not all crypto is 'secure', but with the apps I listed are open to the public for code review and anyone can see how everything is put together. They also use very solid crypto system compared to other apps (telegram) and do a good job with it.
1440 2018-01-11 22:05:57 More like Crypto's face pressure from your FUD. Ah well, just a late boxing day discount.

1459 2018-01-11 22:04:39 Basically just a venue for officials to officially be official on a given topic. Will give insight into the direction of regs. Also gives institutional suits time to think strategy. This doesn’t scare me.
1460 2018-01-11 22:04:38 How many do you need?
1461 2018-01-11 22:04:24 Mmmmm , In the end all the crypto market will be regulate for government. TAX , control. Is just about time. Think u can win the system... is a little bit stupid.

They can control the system in fact if is descentralized , why not make it Totally Legal.
1462 2018-01-11 22:04:23 Its like 3 weeks since alot of the alts had weaker positions and everybody starts now crying because they fall 30-40% , but they are up at least double that from december. Or is just crypto days like months are for non cryptos?
1463 2018-01-11 22:04:18 Coins were distributed and adjusted as far as I understand. It's pretty legit IMO. Concrete date for Pre-ICO, ICO, and exchanges.

1487 2018-01-11 22:03:01 What about the talk that South Korea will ban crypto currency exchanges in the country?
1488 2018-01-11 22:02:58 Crypto has its place but as a true store of value  you need it to be more. I find it very strange how people compare it to gold. Crypto and gold are extremely different assets.

1503 2018-01-11 22:02:15 Investing in alternative investment have very high risk. Investors should determine if #Crypto #bitcoin is right for them. It also has high volatility and is probably not appropriate for first time investors. Once again, call a knowledgeable advisor before making any investment.
1504 2018-01-11 22:02:14 Finger licking good Chicken? For a moment I thought I was still on the news of #forever21 not accepting bitcoin.

Preach on....Bru,..but somewhere else, please.
1605 2018-01-11 21:56:49 People are so dumb on #Hunted. Just don’t ring anybody and use Localbitcoins to get cash locally wherever you are by selling crypto.

1613 2018-01-11 21:56:25 Can you find me a WaPo article that says something happened and it was then proven that it didn’t? There were multiple people in that meeting that could easily come out and say this didn’t happen.

1622 2018-01-11 21:55:56 Why would you EVER think this would get near the top again? The top was in June, pre $BTC moon....
1623 2018-01-11 21:55:56 @AcoCollective - I love the concept of your crowdfunding platform. I am the co-founder of an NGO and I remember how much fees we had to pay when we tried to crowdfund money. If you need any help for promoting your projet please let me know, I manage several Twitter channels.
1624 2018-01-11 21:55:53 China and Russia have banned it too!Crypto currency have to be regulated
1625 2018-01-11 21:55:51 Hmm if you're this good check out XMY and let me know what you think.
1626 2018-01-11 21:55:45 Could be the rebrand.

1633 2018-01-11 21:55:09 200 USD minimum for the token sale? Why a Mimimum and why so high? The ICO concept is fantastic but it lacks regulation and transparency.. so having minimums in token sales is to much (and against the fundamentals of #crypto )
1634 2018-01-11 21:55:05 also Eastman Kodak (I am from Rocheater). they came out of moren then a decade recession from embrassing crypto.

1637 2018-01-11 21:54:47 You do know who it’s partnering with right? What’s your definition of use of a crypto currency?
1638 2018-01-11 21:54:43 Accept crypto thnx
1639 2018-01-11 21:54:42 how? at $5 #TRX #TRON would be bigger (ca. 339 billion  $ market cap) as #BTC #bitcoin  now.
1640 2018-01-11 21:54:27 I don't think it's necessarily a bad investment, I certainly don't recommend credit card companies in general either. Doing business w/ latter is essentially making deals with devils. But there's a concerted effort to shut crypto down as a threat to those deemed "too big to fail"
1641 2018-01-11 21:54:26 how much can you earn by staking?
1642 2018-01-11 21:54:23 Hell yeah. The road to crypto adoption is obviously food

1652 2018-01-11 21:53:56 Ayy crypto man you say the bible was created by the white man but yet you trade in a crypto market that is controlled by them same way they control wall street, you crypto traders think your breaking free from the fiat system but all in all your just falling right into the NWO
1653 2018-01-11 21:53:54 Yo @BigFoltz if you see this im hella interested in crypto currency, couldnt DM you like your post said so maybe hmu? Cheers homie 
1654 2018-01-11 21:53:48 USD is not a standard currency across the world, you would see more national currency where the exchange belong. Not all exchanges has fiat to crypto pairs as well. BTC is the universal base currency for crypto..

1658 2018-01-11 21:53:25 To say the broader markets aren't linked to the crypto market in a coordinated fashion, all one needs to do is look at $MGI 's chart (lead up to today's news and the dangling carrot for algos). #gaptrading #stocks #cryptos #PR #ripple $XRPUSD

1676 2018-01-11 21:52:13 Good thing I took all my crypto out of this exchange. Its been days and still no word from this pathetic exchange.
1677 2018-01-11 21:52:13 I want to be positive but everytime I hope its going to moon it mops the floor instead...
1678 2018-01-11 21:52:13 I am holding strongly to this one
1679 2018-01-11 21:52:11 I do so much crypto trading these days that i was plotting on scooping up Cardano and putting that to the side.  But i forgot i literally already traded for a stash of it when the market was down lmaooo.  I gotta chill
1680 2018-01-11 21:52:09 The dumbest thing I heard today: If you invest in crypto you are indirecting helping out North Korea.
1681 2018-01-11 21:52:09 It would seem that the crypto market is as easily influenced as the monetary market... looks like “they” have control here too... invest wisely

1684 2018-01-11 21:51:52 The US Dollar is a utility token required to purchase Saudi oil. This creates demand that props it up artificially. It has no cap. Mining occurs unchecked in vast quantities. Management team provides zero transparency or audits. If this were crypto, it would be a poor coin.
1685 2018-01-11 21:51:52 The interesting thing is that you get same $btcp for holding btc ($13300) or $zcl($170)
$zcl demand will go up as we get closer to the fork

1688 2018-01-11 21:51:42 But is it #Bitcoin that will be the payment Crypto.  Im still not sure and think the Jury is still out on this one.  Goldman has just recognised #Bitcoin as Money and I think in time to come we will discover another Crypto whose 5 characteristics will match Currency much better.
1689 2018-01-11 21:51:42 Yes they are because now they have big positions in Crypto.
1690 2018-01-11 21:51:41 i need a proper someone to set up a crypto currency mining rig for me. bitcoin possibly.

I am ready to pay whatever.
1691 2018-01-11 21:51:38 Yes there was, and one on Ripple.   The news source originally referenced is my issue.  Too speculative.   Look, Garlinghouse already told us Ripple had 3:5 remittance companies...so it was expected. There was also an in-house slip with a news source yesterday. Alibaba may be nex
1692 2018-01-11 21:51:37 Yes it likely will...now go away @Ripplenews_tech. Your news is all speculation to drive up the price, but yes, the connections with #Baba are REAL possibilities
1693 2018-01-11 21:51:35 When I talk to people about crypto at parties, I tend to wonder why I'm here and not with people that can talk to me about crypto.
1694 2018-01-11 21:51:30 I have, 3 times. Total joke. Avoid
1695 2018-01-11 21:51:29 Takes me back! Those Mastercoin trades (using a Google spreadsheet, remember that?) were some of the first profitable crypto trades I ever made.

1708 2018-01-11 21:50:20 The vast majority of people on this planet don't own a computer or have internet connection. MoneyGram is in 200 countries worldwide with offices where people can go get cash that can be transferred cheaply and in seconds.

1713 2018-01-11 21:50:04 I think it's so interesting how egocentric the Americans are. The man is not English English is his second language nor is the English-speaking world the largest market for crypto maybe we should all learn Chinese or Korean so we can better inform ourselves instead of complaining

1729 2018-01-11 21:49:13 Justement des potes et moi on compte se lancer dans les crypto, ça serai un bon moment pour acheter si j'ai bien compris
1730 2018-01-11 21:49:12 The point is this small trial is the realest thing in crypto right now and the only real project $XRP is the only one people seem to be concerned with valuing fairly instead of irrationally high.
1731 2018-01-11 21:49:10 Doesn't make a difference... its the value that of the coin that counts. Surely when the change happens there will be some adjustments in price more than likely in a positive way due to the fact it can now traded with other higher value currency like bitcoin

1733 2018-01-11 21:49:05 Finally in the crypto game, let's see what this brings 
1734 2018-01-11 21:48:55 Sometimes when I talk to people about crypto I think to myself, "Am i the only one drinking at this party"...
1735 2018-01-11 21:48:31 I envisage a crypto, where buying into it gives you access to a small set of properties, so you can book to park on any one for an extended period, months to years, and you could then switch from one to another, like birds and whales do in different seasons. Perhaps in 15 years.
1736 2018-01-11 21:48:27  dude your pic suggests you support $LTC.
1737 2018-01-11 21:48:25 Crypto is 24/7 I thought.
1738 2018-01-11 21:48:21 Wow that is very kind of you. Look forward to watching. The crypto community never ceases to amaze me with it's kindnesses and generosity. Thanks again!
1739 2018-01-11 21:48:20 More like crypto nerds*
1740 2018-01-11 21:48:16 Please tweet in both Arabic & English Bc I'm trying to explain crypto to my Arabian friends in MENA. Thanks!
1741 2018-01-11 21:48:10 $eth $btc $omg $neo $vtc $gvt $pay $ltc it is dissapointing to see that ppl are so easily influenced by the governments, the real reason why we got into crypto is to overthrow govts and not to fear them. I haven't touched any of my coins. i actually made a killin with $ecash
1742 2018-01-11 21:48:04 Why would discord need it if it's primarily for gaming? I understand why crypto is nice to have but in gaming you want low latency good quality. crypto is really going to compromise that somewhat (more resources being used etc)

1746 2018-01-11 21:47:41 I believe it relates to the misconception by the “crypto” traders that a pilot program is a termed partnership (in the real world pilot programs fail everyday) combined with the lack of confidence from “old money” investors. Metrics, not hype, equal real gains.

1780 2018-01-11 21:43:56 What don't you get? Kringle Cash is a $eth coin. 

They are trying to decentralize and back their #crypto with gold.

They are giving away .00025 to new users until Sept. 2018 

It's like $10 in Etherium
1781 2018-01-11 21:43:30 But if you daytrade, you're just in it for the money, not to invest in the technology you think will be beneficial. Each coin has different tech, if you're really interested in crypto you should research the coins and invest in the one you think has potential. Better ROI anyway.
1782 2018-01-11 21:43:28 Crypto has been so flaky, my mental health is fully affected
1783 2018-01-11 21:43:24 My first deposit into @coinbase has taken over 3 weeks to be confirmed. My bank said the transaction is finalized on both ends. Ironic the crypto exchange is the one with multi week delays, a problem it was meant to solve. Never using this crap service again.
1784 2018-01-11 21:43:23 *danger zone* What is your endgoal here? (Are you talking assymetric or symetric crypto here? Does it need to be authenticated/MACed?)
1785 2018-01-11 21:43:23 Still learning, been testing the waters on crypto with $100 while listening/studying to you and hearing about yours progress :) what do you suggest to use for trade $? For normal trading (not crypto).  Thank you so much!!
1786 2018-01-11 21:43:20 Why would I go into a moneygram office to send money somehow using ripple $xrp? I don't get it. I can sit here and use any crypto coin on my computer to a friend's computer. Someone enlighten me please?

1820 2018-01-11 21:39:23 FEEL BETTER, hope to see you on "THE CRYPTO CRAZE" tomorrow i never miss a show....
1821 2018-01-11 21:39:19 They lifted the ban this AM!! They actually fired the elected official who spearheaded the shutdown amd investigations. They came public amd said it would be detrimental to economy if they banned crypto. Too many people invested!!! Sssiicckk!!
1822 2018-01-11 21:39:14 That implies that every other coin (lower fee) is not secure enough to handle large transactions/holdings. It also implies that crypto needs ‘tiered relationships’. That’s a tough sell. Perhaps Monero will raise fees and adopt segwit & LN too. What then?
1823 2018-01-11 21:39:10 In late December a Coinbase rumor took XRP from $.70 to $3.50. Today a real @MoneyGram announcement only moved the coin +$.25. 
This indicates there's a lid over the entire crypto market right now, something is out of the ordinary. With or without South Korea. #XRP #TRX #xvg #BTC
1824 2018-01-11 21:39:01 And what moon is that? 8’ from the floor?

1826 2018-01-11 21:38:48 If crypto entered the Indy500, would it win? 

How would that work? 

Like if all the coins were on a bus, say.  

Who's driving the bus?

Bitcoin.

Daaaa' Crypto wins.  Fer shur.
1827 2018-01-11 21:38:41 At this hour it would need to break below $1.75 to invalidate the the established trend line. Some times the best strategy is to just hold, and if you're stressing just step away for a few days and forget about crypto then come back ;)

1831 2018-01-11 21:38:15 crypto is very volatile and atm depends on the big players like #btc and #eth. No one knows what comes next. #xvg has a very good technology which will penetrate the market when people acceptance grows.

1842 2018-01-11 21:36:48 No, if he isn't in crypto for the technology, then this article isn't aimed at him and his opinion is irrelevant on the matter, because he's entirely uninvolved in it.
1843 2018-01-11 21:36:46 I do t think I was built to be a crypto trader lol. Or at least maybe not in ripple, even with a huge announcement it feels like it’s a battle to maintain any upward trend or stability . What does your system have the retracement at ?
1844 2018-01-11 21:36:44 I've studied it extensively. I also take guidance from God on financial issues. I've had confirmation from him to invest in other commodities and warnings to avoid crypto.
1845 2018-01-11 21:36:26 Roger Ver may have been the strongest advocate for Bitcoin in its infancy. Bitcoin owes a lot to him. He might even be credited with saving Bitcoin in the future.
1846 2018-01-11 21:36:19 Seems like everything and everyone has stabilized. I love how panic in the crypto world means investments are only up 100% since last month!

1848 2018-01-11 21:36:10 @noModeCoin if u want to take profit and dont want to bet for long term, that's ur choice... Or u can sell ur intial investment, and leave profit in zen for long term... And put intial investment in another coin for day trading.
That's completely ur choice and decision to make.
1849 2018-01-11 21:36:09 Thanks for all the follows this evening

1850 2018-01-11 21:35:53 You guys take so long to publish crypto news that its outdated by the time you post it

1852 2018-01-11 21:35:49 Since the news was released it has been going up. Whether or not it will go down in the future is up for speculation, as is the nature of crypto. It was under $1.80 yesterday, this morning at 9am it hit mid $2's . the high for XRP is only like $2.50 or so, this could be good news
1853 2018-01-11 21:35:43 #TIL today - never invest all, always keep some % of #budget for #crypto free..you never know when #korea or someone goes crazy and you'll have endless opportunities to buy a #dip...this is especially hard if your budget is tight, but very important:)
1854 2018-01-11 21:35:43 I am curious have you met with the management of this company?... Anyhow, very nice trade. A PR every other day, it's a very well run promo, my guess is they get into crypto next week...
1855 2018-01-11 21:35:37 Still under general crypto attention, just going to bigger exchanges. Good time get in imo.
1856 2018-01-11 21:35:35 You gotta admit, if you had been in a coma for a couple of years and woke up today, you'd need a lot explained to you. Maybe not just crypto, but that too. So that's a show for people waking up from a coma,
1857 2018-01-11 21:35:19 Sorry I meant, is the customer able to exchange btc/Ltc for fiat, or can you only buy crypto at the machine

1928 2018-01-11 21:30:20 Crypto is so profitable right now so of course the government is gonna try to get their hands in it.
1929 2018-01-11 21:30:20 You must have got in to crypto in the early 2000s
1930 2018-01-11 21:30:17 @TommyG have any advice for someone new to buying/selling stocks? Not just crypto. Where is a good starting point for info?
1931 2018-01-11 21:29:42 I did

1939 2018-01-11 21:29:04 That’s like saying silver is worth more than gold, BTC will be the gold standard , BCH will be the silver , sure mass adoption is great but in the end BTC will remain #1 #bitcoin
1940 2018-01-11 21:29:03 should’ve hodl’d.
1941 2018-01-11 21:28:47 Rumor on the street is: WMT to repurpose shuttered Sam's Club stores as datacenters for crypto-mining and indoor growing facilities to supply that new market in CA.
1942 2018-01-11 21:28:43 Felt like I’ve been wasting my time following someone who tweets someone else’s charts and tries to make EW fit crypto. 

Of the ~200 crypto personas I’ve checked out so far I’d say about 10-15 are worthwhile. 

I should probably write a long form piece on those 10-15....

1947 2018-01-11 21:28:30 How will #reddcoin do in future
1948 2018-01-11 21:28:29 It’s about crypto currencies
1949 2018-01-11 21:28:26 Agreed. Decentralized exchanges are a massive need in crypto right now, and a great investment opportunity
1950 2018-01-11 21:28:24 great to know.. I don't currently have a @binance_2017 account. When are you planning to open registration to new users?
1951 2018-01-11 21:28:20 Don't be concerned about bitcoin, be concerned about the reaction of the governments #thimopro #bitcoin #bitcoins #crypto
1952 2018-01-11 21:28:16 Crypto means Cryptography, not crypticurrencies.
1953 2018-01-11 21:28:12 No not had a response but it’s just what cobinhood value it at, if you transfer back out you will still have the same amount of coin which will then equal to the correct price on another site
1954 2018-01-11 21:28:10 E mail wouldn’t connect but support e mail did. Trying again tonight.
1955 2018-01-11 21:28:07 And look at it's low - right where I called it and brougth it. its up over 100% at its peak.
1956 2018-01-11 21:28:03 Right? Bitcoin investing is so speculative and the market so volatile, it's not ready to be normalized. Especially when so few people actually understand how crypto-currency actually works. I think people see it as a black box that multiples their investment.
1957 2018-01-11 21:28:00 Do you have a strategy for taking crypto profits to fiat and it so what is it?

1963 2018-01-11 21:27:18 so, crypto currency is no different from any other investment.  but, I agree that sometimes you gotta restate the obvious for idiots.

1974 2018-01-11 21:26:19 How would coins ever make new highs if that was always the case?
1975 2018-01-11 21:26:18 The special thing about $LINX is that they have finished a product, do not promote it yet and wait for the perfect time to release. In 99% of the #crypto projects they promote on the basis of an idea alone.
1976 2018-01-11 21:26:12 dissolving all rumors about the bans gives korean exchanges the green light to continue operations. Koreans are number #1 imo in crypto investments compared to other nations. i believe when ICX hits korean markets, expect it to moon.
1977 2018-01-11 21:26:06 Hey Andreas, if you got the time, Ran’s show is great for spreading knowledge on crypto. Please consider it if you have the time.

1988 2018-01-11 21:25:18 I have a lot of faith in this industry, if you look at the fact that it over came being outlawed.

2002 2018-01-11 21:24:19 Also there's an extra complications.  Some cryptos already experience huge fucntionality flaws (high fees, slow confirmations, extremely high energy costs)...basically destroying the fundamentals the crypto's growth depends upon.

I could say I was using blockchain technology and someone would literally throw money at my business. Bonus monies if I have the word “crypto” somewhere in my business name.
2053 2018-01-11 21:20:56 Must working hard to be listed on other exchanges ...
2054 2018-01-11 21:20:54 Undo the escrow?!? Hahahaha... you so silly!!!
2055 2018-01-11 21:20:48 I'm also enjoying how so many poker players have transferred over their amazing skills and become crypto experts
2056 2018-01-11 21:20:46 They why are you in crypto? You need to get with it so you stop FOMOing your coins and blaming it on McAfee
2057 2018-01-11 21:20:36 The #LightningNetwork integration was a must, nice!
2058 2018-01-11 21:20:34 This was by far the worst attempt of all the food places to get into the crypto chat sphere.
2059 2018-01-11 21:20:31 @crypto_bobby check this out!!! 
2060 2018-01-11 21:20:23 For how long have you been trading? For how long have you been trading crypto?
2061 2018-01-11 21:20:21 All I'm saying, government gonna government. But this gives US more control, not them.
2062 2018-01-11 21:20:18 That’s wild!! Lol
2063 2018-01-11 21:19:58 @etherscan whats going on...
2064 2018-01-11 21:19:50 I LOVE @cheddar you guys ROCK, especially love THE CRYPTO CRAZE segment you do. I especially enjoy @lisahopeking and her tough questions shes on POINT.
2065 2018-01-11 21:19:44 They accept @SpankChain
2066 2018-01-11 21:19:38 loveletter to crypto while an advertisement for bitcoin/crypto riches to flow into fried chiken

While suggesting they will accept bitcoin (WOW! OMG!)
2067 2018-01-11 21:19:35 Fuck Crypto Currency how much ya bench
2068 2018-01-11 21:19:27 Hold for 5 year. Price won't go up. Crypto is just technology nothing else
2069 2018-01-11 21:19:26 Crypto beauty
2070 2018-01-11 21:19:22 Ripple is not crypto!

2072 2018-01-11 21:19:13 If anyone wants a "man on the ground" for info on South Korea crypto, @iamjosephyoung is an excellent resource.
2073 2018-01-11 21:19:09 Just saying you gotta elaborate more bruh. 
Crypto tech != cryptocurrency
2074 2018-01-11 21:19:09 There are already taxes and some regulations on cryptocurrencies. The nature of digital currencies prevents confiscations and penalties, unlike, you know, the US dollars you hold in a bank which at any moment can freeze your account. This is a step in the right direction.
2075 2018-01-11 21:19:08 It's FUD. There are no regulations. This has already been clarified by Ministry of Justice in Korea
2076 2018-01-11 21:19:08 No please we need a video for new people investing in crypto and how some YouTubers are using there channel to pump coins and what to look out for and how to become a better invester etc.....
2077 2018-01-11 21:19:07 Saw a lot of excitement about #tnb, seems to have dropped further; is everyone still bullish? #crypto
2078 2018-01-11 21:19:04 la question c'est : combien tu paris en crypto sur quel trimestre :-) q1 q2 q3 ou q4 :-) #FreeboxV7 1 #bitcoin ? ^^

2080 2018-01-11 21:18:53 1) wrong. hablo de usar la energía con el mayor nivel de inteligencia (eficiencia para los pre siglo 20) posible. te falta leer sobre information theory. 2) la revolución industrial fue el surgimiento del capitalismo. das kapital, marx. crypto es post capitalismo. satoshi, léelo.
2081 2018-01-11 21:18:48 This morning I was about buy $XRP after the MoneyGram news but then I remembered I’m not a fucking moron so I bought $OST instead 
2082 2018-01-11 21:18:46 Which crypto currency?
2083 2018-01-11 21:18:44 わろた

多すぎw
2084 2018-01-11 21:18:39 韓国と日本が買いだすのかなぁ〜
どうなんだろう。
2085 2018-01-11 21:18:35 But most-important of all, is Michelle going to follow @MelissaLeeCNBC's lead & legally change her name to something like Michelle Crypto CaBlockchain, LLC? Her stock would triple in an afternoon!
2086 2018-01-11 21:18:33 Wow. I know the crypto ICO market is getting low on ideas... but this is scraping the bottom of the barrel.
2087 2018-01-11 21:18:31 @Crypto_goat_  how far will $HVN go? Can it get 2x up?
2088 2018-01-11 21:18:18 Bitcoin is money.
You can buy stuff with it now.
You can even buy other money with it - Dollars, Pounds, Yen, Euro etc
I don't have any Bitcoin.
Crypto tech is the infrastructure of the digital future. 
The beauty of Blockchains & Hashgraphs is decentralisation.
2089 2018-01-11 21:18:10 seriously. just pay your taxes guys. it's not that hard
2090 2018-01-11 21:18:10 Spoken like a #propercryptomuppet
2091 2018-01-11 21:18:10 HODL me closer tiny dancer
2092 2018-01-11 21:18:09 I think that anything below 4000 USD will mean that something is totally wrong with Bitcoin, I don't see that so low.
2093 2018-01-11 21:18:06 Finally going to get serious about investing in crypto. This is just the start!  Deposit finally made it to Coinbase after 7 days.
2094 2018-01-11 21:17:52 Very nice Q&A. Answers questions and providing road map. We couldn't ask for much more $vtc
2095 2018-01-11 21:17:50 Started a chat between three great friends who hardly know each other, but who independently talk to me about crypto, then slowly backed away.
2096 2018-01-11 21:17:41 There is one on the chart but it can't hold forever, this coin is lit and we still in altseason
2097 2018-01-11 21:17:39 جميل جدا. اتصفحت الموقع واغلب المشاريع لكن عندي سؤال ؟ ايش المنصة اللي راح يندرج فيها المشروع بعد انتهاء الاكتتاب ؟ فين احصل هذي المعلومة. يعطيك العافية
2098 2018-01-11 21:17:33 You and me both I'm looking for a bid point. Been getting beat down cause crypto hype is dying down

2101 2018-01-11 21:17:18 I’m going to turn to crypto because I’m #Libertarian and I’m tired of being spied on and being told what to buy and what to do and where to spend my money!!! Wake up people!!! This is a opportunity to take our freedoms back!!!! The free market is at work fixing corruption!!!!
2102 2018-01-11 21:17:13 it's about Quantum @QRLedger and Roadmap changes — mainnet launch mid Q1 2018

2108 2018-01-11 21:16:34 Any word from Ted on KIN hitting more exchanges? Seems like other messaging apps (Line/Telegram) are looking to get into crypto as well..
2109 2018-01-11 21:16:32 If all Crypto is purchased with Fiat and all Fiat is subject to inflation, does that mean Crypto in term will be subject to inflation? #Crypto

2111 2018-01-11 21:16:30 not enough crypto, presumably
2112 2018-01-11 21:16:28 Given my name change, I will be taking all #crypto questions here & I am thinking about quitting my job I did so well on the market. Meetings held weekly on a #Saturday night in the courthouse where I love talking about #cryptocurrency 
2113 2018-01-11 21:16:24 どうなんですかねー。

2119 2018-01-11 21:16:08 Pet peeve: seeing smart people writing articles about crypto assets and writing capital B Blockchain instead of blockchains.

No one talks about the innovations of Database and Neural Network, we have databases and neural networks.

2130 2018-01-11 21:15:09 Crypto people will need to ignore mainstream media and fake news for crypto related news like they ignored mainstream media during US elections. It's all agenda ridden, big banks are afraid of crypto others wants to bring it down so they can buy #BTC #Eth

2133 2018-01-11 21:14:56 Gotta give great credit to @fluffypony. Is $XMR scalable? Came straight out and said no. No beating around the bush, no flailing, no excuses. Just answers. 
2134 2018-01-11 21:14:50 Why not support state taxes payable by crypto?  BECAUSE that is inviting the devil inside.  With the state comes taxes, regulations, fines, confiscations, penalties, oversight, committees, on and on and on....  NO F'ING THANKS!
2135 2018-01-11 21:14:49 so is crypto a mania? Sure looking at the charts it looks just like one, but there must be some merit in some of them  $BTC $XRP $ETH
2136 2018-01-11 21:14:32 Yup
2137 2018-01-11 21:14:15 In fact..ling term have more weight...this is not a long term bet .. this is short term bet from 33 to 40 sat before the dip ...bet on this coin no have sense

2142 2018-01-11 21:13:32 The crypto market as a whole has grown SUBSTANTIALLY this cycle and bitcoin is everyone’s accumulation end game. What will happen next?
2143 2018-01-11 21:13:29 A lot of crypto currencies serve actual functions. Retailers like McDonalds are starting to partner with some like TenX because these currencies will have dramatically lower fees than credit cards, which can take up to 6%.

2195 2018-01-11 21:09:15 Don't focus on the token. It's your vehicle to participate in an increasing usage of their product. Look at the product. Users don't want to hold SVD but install automated saving plans that easily swap around fiat and crypto. Very different from coinbase!

2198 2018-01-11 21:08:44 If charts stay true, we should have a steady rise in #bitcoin until about 17800 which at that point would be the end of wave 4. And then either it supports again at 14k or goes down to 10k

最初は怖いけど、
ビットコイン買う→リップルやビットコインキャッシュなど人気コインを買う→慣れてきたら海外取引所で草コインを買う→ICOに興味を持ち始める
とみんなが通る道なのかも 笑

2213 2018-01-11 21:07:04 I came twice reading this.
2214 2018-01-11 21:06:55 Jack Ma said that 'He doesn't have much interest in Bitcoin'. He didn't say none. To add to that that is only Bitcoin. He never addressed Alt Coins and now with this surge in the market I'm sure his interest is a little more peaked with Crypto. BTC will fall someday anyway.
2215 2018-01-11 21:06:53 Just bought some. Thanks for the tip. Looks really good.
2216 2018-01-11 21:06:35 I dare never assume what is going through the fluff meister's head, lest I set myself up for an embarrassing troll job.

2218 2018-01-11 21:06:15 Ark is a monster just watch
2219 2018-01-11 21:06:12 I understand markets are irrational. TRON is a perfect example of that. I hate talking about it because it has so many followers who get insulted. If it does well I wish you all the best. I have some TRON from free airdrops and referrals. These are just my views.
2220 2018-01-11 21:06:09 @LuxCrypto Looking to getting into crypto currency and was wondering which are the best websites to use to buy coins other than Coinbase. Thanks
2221 2018-01-11 21:06:06 I said no. New better decentralizes platforms are being built on the block chain. Let's nurture them and let them grow. Then Mass Exodus #crypto #blockchaintechnology
2222 2018-01-11 21:06:01 @MoneyGram partnering with @Ripple, I believe they wont just be positioning themselves for cheaper transfer fees. But have adopted a great platform in case ALL crypto truly dominates currency. Its a win win no matter what. (also could see a future USDcrypto -> XRP -> YenCrypto)
2223 2018-01-11 21:05:51 @6BillionPeople what’s up Marquis. I got a question. What would you recommend as a very good read for someone who is just getting into crypto currency. Thanks.
2224 2018-01-11 21:05:49 Crypto has been getting a lot of bad press lately. Buffet recently said he thinks it’s a bubble.
2225 2018-01-11 21:05:46 Regulation means 2 things: Transparency and tax. This will solidify the $crypto market.  And I think the most important characteristic of the market is not mentioned.  It cannot be manipulated by big players in the way other markets can.  In

2232 2018-01-11 21:05:15 He is wrong about crypto, but right about investing. His main rule and principle is to not invest in something he doesn’t understand the value of. I disagree with his understanding & opinion on crypto, but applaud him for this principle. This man was “hodling” way before crypto.

2243 2018-01-11 21:04:22 what is the % ?
2244 2018-01-11 21:04:20 10% er ingenting. Du må tåle mye mer volatilitet enn det hvis du skal eie crypto.

2246 2018-01-11 21:04:09 I want tron to take off but you can just watch the 24 hr volume decreasing on binance. People are losing interest even with big partnership news.
2247 2018-01-11 21:04:09 This thread is amazing! Interesting to see how you became a big bagholder. 

I only saw your entries though, kinda curious if you also sold some and when?

2260 2018-01-11 21:02:26 I am Korean but this won’t happen because the current party wouldn’t want to lose the upcoming election. 30% of young gens are investing on crypto market. That ban proposal was only initiated by the ministry of law but the other ministry of economics is not happy to ban.
2261 2018-01-11 21:02:21 They’re blockin crypto tradin, working on legislation to ban it alltogether. In the way of progress...
2262 2018-01-11 21:02:20 Tone is losing respect by the day. Use to respect you until you dog every other crypto constantly. Not only are you super close minded but you need to go see a psychiatrist and get on some new medication. Whatever you're taking is NOT working!!!

2264 2018-01-11 21:02:10 I dug deep enough to be able say, that the behavior of the team alone does not satisfy my moderate standards for investments in crypto space.

2271 2018-01-11 21:01:04 People in crypto have been waiting for the next huge global economic collapse ever since 2009.

2283 2018-01-11 21:00:39 I also think the problem is most people running businesses in the crypto space do not actually understand capital markets and how to value a company. Every team should have a finance investor relation person on it. Would prevent problems like this.

2296 2018-01-11 21:00:18 I like your train of thought, unfortunately I think a large portion of the crypto crowd doesn't have much interest in gold. I think with the Goldmoney Holding account any crypto holder that understands the value of gold could trade their crypto for gold or vice versa.

2310 2018-01-11 20:59:42 WHAT ARE YOU SAY？CAN YOU TELL ME
2311 2018-01-11 20:59:38 Precisely. While vigilance over all nascent tech is perfectly valid, seems like most naysayers on crypto have one thing in common: either they don’t understand it fully, or they’re unable to shake a 20th century mindset—sometimes unwittingly.

2320 2018-01-11 20:58:57 Also crypto value (could be plugged into Gompertz equation somehow) is determined by something like (applicative, productive value) / (transaction fee * confirmation time * energy consumption)
2321 2018-01-11 20:58:53 It’s important to remember when everything is forming what appears to be flags that it’s only bullish if it breaks out. Wait for confirmation to minimize risk. Be more patient - it’s and easy way to prevent from getting rekt. $crypto

2331 2018-01-11 20:58:30 absolute dumbest idea:

open up a steakhouse restaurant that only take crypto payment and call it "proof of steak"

2333 2018-01-11 20:58:17 Chemo and radiation wasn't cheap.. Good for you that yours could be treated naturally. Something tells me bitcoin isn't covered by Obummercare 
2334 2018-01-11 20:58:15 ビットコイン二百万ですもんね〜
仮想通貨がせっかく大流行始まりましたが、DMMなどで仮想通貨始める人、みんなはじめBTC買うんだろうなぁって思ってます。１枚が高いからとっつきづらいはずだし安くて有望なリップルを選んで欲しいけど、0.01BTCという買い方も出来ますしなんだかんだビットコ行きそう
2335 2018-01-11 20:58:12 Yup! Thanks! I’m really new with crypto, so still learning!
2336 2018-01-11 20:58:09 All judgment is done using FOREX mentality... in #crypto these moves are not sell offs.. they are price swings.  In the future when the market stabilizes FOREX-like analysis might be suitable.  At the moment it is misleading.
2337 2018-01-11 20:58:07 Taking bets for when @theinformation #crypto private subscriber Slack channel will overtake the #facebook_twitter one in membership. It's on a tear. Sign of the times.
2338 2018-01-11 20:58:01 Your show was awesome. We need a systematic course in learning and understanding Crypto. Crypto University. Every time I learn something I have another 20 questions
2339 2018-01-11 20:57:53 If you get into office, please tell me that you won’t vote for anything that tampers with crypto.
2340 2018-01-11 20:57:45 My plan is to hold $ICX till the end of Q1 then reevaluate. Do you have thoughts on it possibly being a one year hold?
2341 2018-01-11 20:57:33 The Crypto market has seen extreme downward trend the past week. These drastic drops may be the popping of the crypto bubble and time to get out. Or is this a buying opportunity.... #cryptocurrency #investing #HODL #noregrets #WatchOut

2343 2018-01-11 20:57:25 where to buy? 
2344 2018-01-11 20:57:23 instead of doing work i just stare at the crypto charts all day

2347 2018-01-11 20:57:14 can't withdraw from Binance yet, but it would work in theory :)
2348 2018-01-11 20:57:06 How are they going to track crypto?
2349 2018-01-11 20:57:05 Ya but ur responding to someone who says they will b using #MoneyGram from now on. #XRP makes it way cheaper to send money for MoneyGram. They will be able to charge less in fees while mainting profit. Fee she is referring to aren't crypto fees but transfering $ in general
2350 2018-01-11 20:56:49 For our very first tweet, I want to say that we are very excited to be cultivating our Twitter presence. We hope to be a source for your crypto news and share some our analysis of coin market trends. #Crypto #cryptocurrency #CryptoNews

2352 2018-01-11 20:56:42 if you really believe in crypto u wouldnt care how much 'real money' you have...

2355 2018-01-11 20:56:32 Yes they said it on Twitter, there was a database corruption
2356 2018-01-11 20:56:32  lol no.
2357 2018-01-11 20:56:29 Like the podcast Erik but the reasons you listed are nothing new in the crypto world.
2358 2018-01-11 20:56:29 But sometimes.....when everything lines up JUST right......I DO know what's gonna happen.....

2363 2018-01-11 20:55:59 @CryptoDale @K1llerWh4le @13Prince31 do you guys mind if I DM about a project idea that I think would be awesome for crypto.....? There will be a white paper( not plagiarized ) a token asset and a ICO. BTW love the podcast !!

2373 2018-01-11 20:55:14 Google doesn’t say that is a Coinbase transaction.
2374 2018-01-11 20:55:14 "west virginia only has ONE crypto" is flatwoods monster erasure and i wont stand for it
2375 2018-01-11 20:55:10 Its only the begining of what #hvn achieve. Most of the demands will come from the plattform and market to match it. $hvn
2376 2018-01-11 20:55:09 Same here 3-5x up in Q1, Q4 $10. I like keep estimate on low expectations level. $SPHTX can go multiple x up from my forecast, if things are made right here. #SAP #business #Crypto

2395 2018-01-11 20:53:41 for just being crypto traders, they did an amazing job keeping there heads with ver, his passive insults&fud where met with professionalism.
2396 2018-01-11 20:53:39 Yeah.. How dumb of me to go through chemo and radiation.. I could have just used bitcoin. SMH. 
2397 2018-01-11 20:53:35 It's still the top dog in crypto world. Whoever caught it when it was low is still doing good.
2398 2018-01-11 20:53:29 Can I enter now
2399 2018-01-11 20:53:29 big opportunity of buying!! most probably there are many coins right now at a price we will never see them again!!!!
2400 2018-01-11 20:53:27 今日が土日なら付き合いたいけど、そんなことはないからもう一眠りしたい感
2401 2018-01-11 20:53:26 Exactly. To me "gainz" are irrelevant right now. What's important is the furthering of this technology and keeping the ideologies alive. We need to remember why crypto was started in the first place. Not to become rich but to be free.
2402 2018-01-11 20:53:24 does the CPI calculation include crypto currencies?
2403 2018-01-11 20:53:18 Fun game - try and think of some use of crypto currency that doesn't already exist.
2404 2018-01-11 20:53:12 CoinExchange and Cryptopia are still seen as shitcoin paradise. Linda doesn't seem to be a shitcoin. The sooner it get listed on other exchages, the better.

2409 2018-01-11 20:52:45 You had me at #TRX
2410 2018-01-11 20:52:42 Nah, that would have spiked them more like 130%.......13% is for chumps in the crypto era #kiddingofcourse
2411 2018-01-11 20:52:40 Wow! Already closed again? This is crazy.
2412 2018-01-11 20:52:36 Quit spreading FUD, you liar. The crypto space is just as volatile as it's always been. I rode #Bitcoin from $650 down to $250 in 2014-2015. Now we're at $13k. If you don't have the stomach to HODL through these price movements and buy the dips, just get out.
2413 2018-01-11 20:52:28 INDEED, well put. I think this administration is very BUSINESS friendly, I mean you see regulations being lifted in many different sectors. energy/internet/taxes etc. I think its a great time for the Crypto community as a whole.
2414 2018-01-11 20:52:27 Moving again into #xrp money gram deal is bigcould propell the coin back in $3 range. #ripple coins could actually come into circulation #crypto
2415 2018-01-11 20:52:25 @SatoshiLite and @justinsuntron  combined would create the crypto UNICORN...
2416 2018-01-11 20:52:18 僕まだBTC上目線だけど、それよりアルト終了の危険性を考えてる。
でも、それに100%賭けるつもりもなくて、五分五分で構える。
ポートフォリオ整理中。

2417 2018-01-11 20:52:09 What do you think about modum? Can it go above this price?

2433 2018-01-11 20:50:57 It isn't all that useful as anything other than a value store. You can't purchase anything with it quickly, fees are astronomical and it's massively overloaded. It's Crypto v1.0 and things are moving on quickly, people like Tone are going to get left behind holding bags.
2434 2018-01-11 20:50:56 Sure. So how do you buy/sell eg ignis without a centralized „exchanger“. Pleeeeaaasseeee, on crypto things, only speak when you have something to say.

2452 2018-01-11 20:49:34 My goal this year for crypto is to build up my BTC profolio, let's see if I can get 1 full bitcoin at the end of the year 
2453 2018-01-11 20:49:32 I agree with the decentralization aspect and the lightening network. you can have atomic swaps with other currencies like $BCC. In litecoin’s current state, how is it different exactly a bitcoin cash? Isn’t bitcoin cash effectively cheaper?

2466 2018-01-11 20:48:30 Mate, agree. Banks can be a pain. If you are investing for the future, #Ripple is the way to go. If you want an overnight return, look to the other high risk altcoins. All the best. Cheers.

2474 2018-01-11 20:48:00 I've been liquidating the last few weeks. 6 months ago the value was in the potential of crypto. Now it's all hype. Too many new players who don't know what they're doing. It's gambling now not investing
2475 2018-01-11 20:47:54 I've traded crypto, invested and traded stocks and from my experience shorting penny stocks tends to be the most predictable strategy

2480 2018-01-11 20:47:22 MoneyGram won't require you to buy your own ripple. I don't think you're getting it. Someone will walk into MoneyGram, ask to send money, hand over that money, and MoneyGram will send it using XRP. Crypto exchanges won't be involved as MoneyGram will hold ripple for this purpose
2481 2018-01-11 20:47:18 Honest to God, I do not understand this whole Bitcoin stuff. "Crypto currency"... Wth is it anyway? Just give me straight cash, homey.
2482 2018-01-11 20:47:10 I still don't understand how Crypto-currency gets it's value.
2483 2018-01-11 20:46:56 Would buy it if it wasn’t for that stupid moon. Spoils the entire thing imo
2484 2018-01-11 20:46:47 I am getting kind of piss at this entire Korea situation!!!! Exclude them and let's drive the market using the rest of the world!!! There is plenty of capital to drive this!!! They don't want crypto!!! Well no crypto for them!!!! People from S Korea can invest through other pages
2485 2018-01-11 20:46:47 Just a $130 billion-dollars drop FUD. No biggie #crypto
2486 2018-01-11 20:46:46 Crypto is going to give me gray hairs...kids didn’t do it, turning 30 didn’t do it but crypto with all it’s malfunctions, poor UX/UI, long tx times, and no customer support will.

2489 2018-01-11 20:46:25 Well, we've had Korea crack down, China mining ending and Warren Buffet death call for crypto in the last few days to add to the FUD from the end of the year.

2492 2018-01-11 20:46:17 STOP INVESTING IN SHITCOINS AND INVEST IN $THESENUTS #CryptoNews #cryptocurrency #bitcoin #shitcoin #crypto
2493 2018-01-11 20:46:16 I'm new to masternodes but my experience in crypto makes me care more about teams and vision than gimmicks or short term ROI
2494 2018-01-11 20:46:09 why do you think this? any specific reason ?
2495 2018-01-11 20:46:09 Crypto is just like anything else.  Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.  It can be very good.  It can also be very volatile.  Download the Coinbase app, set up an account.  That's where you start.
2496 2018-01-11 20:46:07 @Kodak taking a leap into the crypto mining world. This should be good! #kodak #crypto #ces #bitcoin
2497 2018-01-11 20:46:05 Where do you see that?
2498 2018-01-11 20:46:04 That's what I'm doing. I'm loving being back producing content. I think crypto may be the thing that rejuvenates the channel. The Bitcoin video I did has done the best since my return.
2499 2018-01-11 20:46:03 What prevent Crypto currencies from been issued faster than USD, BTC was forked to BCH, BTG and more will come, Also The 21 million BTC limit can be modified once the miners agrees to increase the limit as Charlie Munger explained.

2510 2018-01-11 20:45:21 Thanks. Hey what advice can you get be on the evaluation process? I’ve read quite a bit where they say to look at the code as a way to verify it’s a legitimate crypto with value but I wouldn’t know what to look for? How does one evaluate a crypto?
2511 2018-01-11 20:45:19 İn 2018 btc =1300$!!! What u think?
2512 2018-01-11 20:45:08 It’s the opposite of what we want for crypto lol but if you’re in it for the gains cheers, I had some at 20 cents but sold it long ago

2519 2018-01-11 20:44:47 The people who doubted crypto when I tried to put them on are the ones asking me for advice ahahaha To late!!
2520 2018-01-11 20:44:46 The #Tron story gets deeper and deeper.... Even if I wanted to get out on Tron (i have no intention too), I couldn't because of updates like this... Tron is very black and white, its either going to go south HARD or up north HARD. Let just say, i bought more! #TRX #TRONFOUNDATION
2521 2018-01-11 20:44:42 You might not be able to find out an example where there's completely no 'suspect trading' before a big announcement. Charlie is trying his best to maintain the transparency of the crypto community, which would definitely be vital in the future. He could have hidden all the info
2522 2018-01-11 20:44:23 Can use the app or web on mobile devices can you.  Will not log me in I keep getting error failed to log in for Binance

2525 2018-01-11 20:43:51 I can't stand this. My portfolio has neither gained nor lost since yesterday. Crypto, stop being so boring!
2526 2018-01-11 20:43:44 I have a stop loss set at 15%, and trailing stop loss arms at 3% / 1%. But it has been a couple of rough days on the markets.
2527 2018-01-11 20:43:38 If people ever tell you that you made easy money by crypto or got lucky…just smile and think about the hard work, learning curves, stress and sleepless nights before you gained anything.
2528 2018-01-11 20:43:31 ビットコインはもう今更やん〜

2536 2018-01-11 20:42:53 I dunno man. Asian crypto traders seemed to be drunk last night. Maybe a further #XRP $XRP jump on the MoneyGram news?
2537 2018-01-11 20:42:52 $DBC $DRGN and $DENT are all in buy zones. If $DBC goes below 2300 it's probably going to 1500. If Dent closes/opens below ~475, it's probably going to dump to 230 min and if drgn goes below 20, @jebus911
will probably get death threats. That being said, go buy some fkn crypto.

2544 2018-01-11 20:42:23 I think I follow. So this brings my mind to ask, how receptive are traditional currencies and their governances to this? Will the dollar, euro, yen, etc... coexist once bitcoin or any other crypto hits critical mass?
2545 2018-01-11 20:42:22 I have it on bitfinex, is it a good Exchange or should i change it? Would be very nice if someone can answer that question..:)

2552 2018-01-11 20:41:42 You realize that multiple coins doing well is a good thing.  See if I profit on Linda I can buy more ltc if I profit ltc I can buy more Linda and so on crypto market needs to work as a whole to bring more money to the over group!
2553 2018-01-11 20:41:42 Ouch
2554 2018-01-11 20:41:42 All the more impressive when you consider that NYSE market cap is over $21 trillion and crypto still under $1 trillion

2562 2018-01-11 20:41:14 Yea he was damned if you do damned if you don’t. This is decentralized crypto, Charlie can do what he wants. Litecoin is Litecoin. It did not affect the code in any way and you can still choose to run a node or not. Ltc is judged on its merits, not on a person.
2563 2018-01-11 20:41:08 Please do not abandon your offspring DogeCoin.We do not want banks, governments, and the world's richest people to destroy the crypto world with the help of Ripple and other of its artificial centralized tools.Shine on your child a part of your life!

2567 2018-01-11 20:41:01 Can we have an update after turmoil move today throughout Crypto's. Can see some survivals still out there , Hope TRX will be one of these.
2568 2018-01-11 20:40:35 got 5 out off 10 
2569 2018-01-11 20:40:34 Any idea when it will be available on Binance?
2570 2018-01-11 20:40:26 Only a matter of time.. very few exits from crypto to fiat. How much cash do Coinbase/Kraken/Gemini have if there's a mass withdrawal movement. I have a bad feeling
2571 2018-01-11 20:40:08 Great year for crypto and vertcoin. 2018 will be the year of the Elite.  Coins with real world use will survive,  clones and scams will fade
2572 2018-01-11 20:39:59 Yes
2573 2018-01-11 20:39:46 I don't know most of the films with Richard yet. It's also not easy to get some movies, many are not available in Germany for example Cruel & Unusual.  Two movies, "Crypto" and "Break my Heart 1000 Times" will be released this year, I'm looking forward to both of them.
2574 2018-01-11 20:39:43 Do not think investing in crypto is a get rich scheme, please do your research. I have talked with at least 8 people today who are talking about investing everything they have into it, without really knowing how it works or why #business
2575 2018-01-11 20:39:42 TheKey IPO was gracy. It comes more and more difficult to participate hot ICOs because so much growth.
2576 2018-01-11 20:39:29 Like TRON Crypto currency and how it will make Alibaba the hottest place to shop in the world and multiply revenues by bring millions of new customers?
2577 2018-01-11 20:39:28 Just because they have a card doesn't mean they are ahead.... look at the team. Look at the partners. Look at what they have, and will do. IMO centra is the last I'd choose from this list.
2578 2018-01-11 20:39:20 Bekleyeceğiz. Ama binance de bu tür sorunlar sıkıntı olmaya bAşladı

2581 2018-01-11 20:39:14 Exactly... how is this possible if crypto is treated as invisible real estate??  Hahah

2589 2018-01-11 20:38:41 Yeah thats the smartest move. All in all top 20 crypto with big partners and growing market cap. The odds are in your favor my friend.
2590 2018-01-11 20:38:35 Is that in its ico stage? Because I can’t seem to find btcp
2591 2018-01-11 20:38:34 If you try to get rich tomorrow...sell your coins, I will buy them :D
@justinvendetta said it is long term ;D
2592 2018-01-11 20:38:30 Xrp fan here but I would also like all the crypto tribes to above all be respectful. Popper has declared he owns no crypto. I take him at his word. As a fmr Newsweek correspondent, i know it’s forbidden for legit journos to own anything they cover.

2607 2018-01-11 20:37:24 @boxmining @cryptodailyuk Crypto channels: When reporting the news your titles should say “non-ban” or else you’re really helping spread stupidity and “FUD”
2608 2018-01-11 20:37:18 In my understanding they will use the crypto as the enabler of the money transfer, it is a first stage. Put yourself on the place of the grandma that sends money to her family in another country, she has no clue what crypto is, but she would benefit for lower transfer fees.
2609 2018-01-11 20:37:11 Don't buy into any FOMO. The research you gain from digging into the functionality and the ideology of crypto is better than the monetary gains. The money will follow once you understand the underlying systems. I waited 2 years before trading. Get a cheap S3 and play with it.

2621 2018-01-11 20:36:41 You seem to be anti crypto as a whole... I don’t know what difference there is between Satoshi and Charlie Lee other than the fact that Satoshi is anonymous. Each made a crypto that the world is beginning to embrace.
Your user name is bitfinexed. Focus on the real bad actors.
2622 2018-01-11 20:36:40 LOL... all too true, but don't forget the outrageous transfer times and  miner's fees larger than international bank transfers in the 80s.
2623 2018-01-11 20:36:39 All the US indices....This is turning into some Crypto mania...

2625 2018-01-11 20:36:29 It is the guy with the nazi flag! Why was he on Warski's stream? Was this crypto fascist supposed to be a moderating force or what?
Oh and put a shirt on, you alpha male.
2626 2018-01-11 20:36:25 soundcloud producers and crypto currencies go together like @realDonaldTrump and bad headlines...
2627 2018-01-11 20:36:16 well let's hope you succeed soon with that im starting to get impatient lol

2630 2018-01-11 20:36:06 Hmm too late I did not realise who is writing there! Blockchain newcomer? With crypto we can protect everything everytime as long we want. Or I'm wrong?
2631 2018-01-11 20:36:01 Hodl strong folks.  Tough day for a lot of us.  Trust your picks, and remember what’s happened in the past.  We dip on #FUD and recover stronger. #hodl #crypto #btc #eth #trx

2640 2018-01-11 20:35:08 I love your videos! Keep it solo :)
2641 2018-01-11 20:35:00 Do you suggest get in on FUEL and OST?
2642 2018-01-11 20:34:59 i personally hate it
2643 2018-01-11 20:34:47 びっくりするぐらいbtcさんしか売られてない感
2644 2018-01-11 20:34:46 If your planning on hodling just buy now. Wont matter if it was 700 or 800 in a couple months
2645 2018-01-11 20:34:44 It's a crap exchange
2646 2018-01-11 20:34:43 Problem is Ethereum depsits are not working at all. 2 days sitting on my ass, funds still haven't arrived at my wallet. Anyone else having this issue?
2647 2018-01-11 20:34:38 Mine crypto with it!
2648 2018-01-11 20:34:35 sorta...its more like the anti-stock market
2649 2018-01-11 20:34:34 if a mene crypto can do it ....
2650 2018-01-11 20:34:32 いろんな通貨が貰えるんですか？

2659 2018-01-11 20:33:54 The coin that makes transferring in and out of fiat (not USDT) with little effort will be the golden coin of 2018. We understand crypto, the masses do not.

2663 2018-01-11 20:33:34 Chop chop!! Let’s get some positive announcements to the public. Patients is no longer a virtue. This is crypto world!!
2664 2018-01-11 20:33:28 @ToneVays Everyone! The Donald Trump of crypto. "Horrible coin, Terrible. It should be locked up. Bitcoin is gonna be YUGE. Dont listen to fake news and ripple." Grow up bro.
2665 2018-01-11 20:33:28 So why does CNBC only pump Ripple? There are many other far more promising coins out there that are actually decentralized. Ripple is not actual #crypto. Its centalized pre-mined, manipulated by large investors... kind of like Fiat currency. Oh but you like the same-same?
2666 2018-01-11 20:33:23 With the state of crypto as it is I’d be surprised if the hole ever ends.
2667 2018-01-11 20:33:18 Not daytrading here
2668 2018-01-11 20:33:14 Where's the list of the "10 biggest names in Crypto" that will be on the show?
2669 2018-01-11 20:33:12 for sure!
2670 2018-01-11 20:33:00 I hope you didn't miss out on #lindacoin

2672 2018-01-11 20:32:55 I’m convinced most ppl don’t fully grasp the concept of utilization of crypto 
2673 2018-01-11 20:32:52 You’ll need to buy ETH/BTC to purchase other crypto on the site
2674 2018-01-11 20:32:52 How to get rich:

- Buy your Favourite crypto (But no McAffee shitcoin)
-Activate netflix
- Bingewatch: Friends, GoT, Dexter, Sons of Anarchy, Homeland, Black Mirror, Peaky Blinders and pick a few of your choice (in any order)
-Be rich like a boss

2676 2018-01-11 20:32:45 Im alright with isps fast-laning netflix and hulu if i can just go on reddit and read post from crypto dipshits about how they lost a second mortgage on their house in bitcoin investments
2677 2018-01-11 20:32:43 Tiffany I don't even know how you handle misinformation and FUD everyday. Looks like those people NEVER stop and don't wanna hear anyway.  #Ripple #XRP #xrpthestandard
2678 2018-01-11 20:32:42 .@BittrexExchange hasn't announced it however it appears that you can now generate new addresses for $crypto deposits/withdrawals
2679 2018-01-11 20:32:40 Keep it up and you won't ever even need that law degree homie.
2680 2018-01-11 20:32:40 And I know lightning network is coming but that’s a long way off in crypto time.
2681 2018-01-11 20:32:39 Not sure but I believe it'll be a top 10 exchange (volume wise)
2682 2018-01-11 20:32:37 You have to pay someone tax to withdraw and send crypto currency lmao what are you on about
2683 2018-01-11 20:32:32 Time to buy crypto. Although it's volitile, you can really put your money to work.... The banks savings rate are an absolute joke.

2686 2018-01-11 20:32:08 Thanks for letting me know, mine finally showed up after 4 hours so I got lucky in the end as I know others have been waiting longer like yourself. I hope it shows up soon for you.
2687 2018-01-11 20:32:06 Who's talking about bitcoin now? Every crypto is vaporware, sorry if I hurt your feelings with your favourite cryptoshit.
2688 2018-01-11 20:32:05 Hey Tips On Crypto thanks for the follow!
2689 2018-01-11 20:32:01 Which devs are best suited to be transformed to crypto devs? Naively I would say JavaScript engineers will pick up Solidity quickly but that answer does not really satisfy me.
2690 2018-01-11 20:31:59 These whales just like screwing shit up
2691 2018-01-11 20:31:45 Where do I send my $2FA recovery codes for the airdrop? Do they go on the exchange that the codes are used to sign into? $crypto
2692 2018-01-11 20:31:41 You are widely mistaken. It will go beyond that!! This is a paradigm shift. To even use the term crypto currency is to not fully grasp the long term consequences. #bitcoin etc should be called what they really are and will be in the future: #decentralizationtools #dct’s
2693 2018-01-11 20:31:33 Bitch pls

2701 2018-01-11 20:31:18 $KODK I have a feeling the folks at Eastman Kodak are either trying to scam people, or have no clue how crypto mining works and the increasing difficulty of the hash. You can't sell mining equipment under the pretense that it will remain forever profitable as difficulty goes up.

2711 2018-01-11 20:30:48 @CryptoHuntGame A very unique concept. Definitely something worth checking out if you are into A/R games or crypto.
2712 2018-01-11 20:30:48 How are you feeling about tron in the long term??
2713 2018-01-11 20:30:43 Awesome
2714 2018-01-11 20:30:40 Indeed can be irrelevant for you, buddy. But there are a good number of people that are not even still in the banking system. Crypto is just a strange idea to 99.9% of the population, and many of them still rely on those services to send money
2715 2018-01-11 20:30:37 今までだったら、BTC停滞したり、回復したりするとアルトがもっと上がってたのに、伸びて来ない。これ、前も経験した感じがするので警戒感バリバリ。テスト前なのにー

2722 2018-01-11 20:29:46 Good read! Very interesting to see where this all goes!
2723 2018-01-11 20:29:43 Weird. Complete opposite for me. 

That's what's great about crypto! So much variety in backgrounds in this new world.
2724 2018-01-11 20:29:43 What?
2725 2018-01-11 20:29:37 Crypto prices are changing so fast by the time you read it in the news it's already the opposite again

2732 2018-01-11 20:29:05 You might already know this but I think that the bonus tokens going out on the 15th of January could be a good buying opportunity! I know most people will probably dump their OST which might cause a short dip that will most likely not last. Good chance to buy the dip!
2733 2018-01-11 20:29:02 haha anything is possible in crypto!
2734 2018-01-11 20:28:56 Aaha! Thanks for the correction :) I get that there is no legal grounds. Its FUD like this which forces regulation, which goes against the nature of the tech.
2735 2018-01-11 20:28:52 I guess I'm ok having bought at 2 cents!!!
2736 2018-01-11 20:28:49 I paid about 0.5 ETH to buy/sell/breed my stock of 20 crypto kitties. I'd take 0.05 now for the lot. This was one of the biggest scams since Enron and I'm ashamed to admit I bought the hype.

2741 2018-01-11 20:28:03 Guys I need a new hobby outside of crypto and gaming.

Preferably a co-ed activity.

Shill me.
2742 2018-01-11 20:27:58 I wrote in a journal 6 months ago that i would have 30k by the new year. Im over halfway their because of crypto!

Follow me, tech bots.
2744 2018-01-11 20:27:53 If you’re into privacy and you never bought $XMR, I’m not sure what you’re doing.

Btw none of your shitcoins are actually private.
2745 2018-01-11 20:27:53 Crypto currencies are suffering rn.. Everything is in minus ..If purchased with 20% of the current market price for each currency  you are still fine

2749 2018-01-11 20:27:38 I'm sorry, sir. It's completely irrelevant to me. That wasn't a fair statement. Money Gram, WILL BE irrelevant, once crypto fully adopts. So, they still have some time.
2750 2018-01-11 20:27:25 Have you seen any stats on how much crypto currency is used as currency, vs. how much is simply sitting in speculators’ portfolios waiting to be sold on?
2751 2018-01-11 20:27:16 Yeah, when I got into crypto was able to ride a little of the upswing, now it's not so exciting... but everyone talks about a bounce back soon.
2752 2018-01-11 20:27:06 Not to mention the variability of transaction fees.

It's funny to see the crypto-libertarians slowly roasting themselves.
2753 2018-01-11 20:27:04 Which they then converted to crypto kittens
2754 2018-01-11 20:27:02 Looks like the market is still tanking do y'all think it's just because #crypto got banned on the Korean markets? Or is it a dip before a Bull run begins? #altcoinarmy
2755 2018-01-11 20:27:00 Hi Peter, #househunting in London is not as exciting as crypto :-( 
however, if you want to find an awesome rental place (maybe even before you reach here!), hire one of our concierges via @UrbanCo_UK ... you can continue crypto trading, while we do house search for you ;-)
2756 2018-01-11 20:26:57 Ohhhhhh...so is it like the Stock Market n stuff?
2757 2018-01-11 20:26:55 Isn't 'crypto mania' the Rogers Curve adoption cycle for all innovation technology?

Oh, and please marry several people in this thread ;-)

2761 2018-01-11 20:26:25 A crypto Atomic Swap is like a cross-border exchange between Chuck E. Tokens and Canadian Tire cash bonus bills.
2762 2018-01-11 20:26:22 "this guy" is a person that spent many years learning about technical analysis and who sits behind a computer doing many analyses so that we can have a better awareness of the market and better chances to make money. So maybe a little respect and gratitude would be in place.
2763 2018-01-11 20:26:13 Damn this one is volatile, it’s like a completely different price every 10 seconds. Also how did you get Blockfolio to look like that? 
2764 2018-01-11 20:26:11 No, investing. Cryptocurrencies. Like Bitcoin and etheruem.
2765 2018-01-11 20:26:09 Ich freu mich schon auf die Crypto-Blase 2026.
2766 2018-01-11 20:26:09 He's a rigorous critical independent thinker who trusts his own judgement over the factional herd mentality that dominates crypto. His points are data based and serious. Crypto needs 1000x more people like this and 1000x fewer pump and dump fraudsters.
2767 2018-01-11 20:26:08 Peace I am currently doing a video on @wagerrx and would like to ask you some questions about the project for the video. Its going to be a @crypto-tokenhighlight where I explain different projects to people. Would love to get your input ty@MMAforMoney
2768 2018-01-11 20:26:06 Everyone has heard of Bitcoin by now but did you know there are almost almost 2000 crypto coins/tokens out there? It's getting stupid. Many are nothing more than ponzi scams. Others are simply useless except to make someone tens of thousands of dollars before they shutdown.

2772 2018-01-11 20:25:59 A wick touch to 12K-12.8K... then a fast rebound... the daily chart shows an inverse head and shoulder but the 4hr is in a head and shoulders... so a quick dump then closes above 13K to keep the inverse in play
2773 2018-01-11 20:25:57 30%: Nothing special, in the middle of a crypto bloodbath ? Oh please go and troll under a bridge somewhere
2774 2018-01-11 20:25:57 25% lol c'est rien dans le monde de la crypto
2775 2018-01-11 20:25:51 That's for sure, I'll keep it in mind too if I ever get cancer again. 
2776 2018-01-11 20:25:46 The problem is that you're far too emotionally invested in tron, I in no way "dogged" your crypto asset, I simply commented about how it doesn't have a working product, and you took it as an insult, tron has lots of potential.

2780 2018-01-11 20:25:37 If your not in the YouTube to make money hen turn if off and show people your not just in to it for the money as you make enough off crypto . ITS GHAT SIMPLE . Or own the fact it’s now turned in to a money make in machine
2781 2018-01-11 20:25:34 You guys are the deal, appreciate the give away opportunity 
2782 2018-01-11 20:25:32 It was only said 3 out of the top 5, not necessarily 1,2 and 3.
2783 2018-01-11 20:25:26 This is already happening with crypto-currency
2784 2018-01-11 20:25:26 Wehave a 50bil supply but this is going places. How much are masternodes expected to take off the supply levels? i.e you need to hold 3 million each time? If crypto really takes off ultimately $5 is not out of the question surely for this great technology.
2785 2018-01-11 20:25:25 I place that says it provides up to date crypto information should be posting a better article then, “hey guys here are our 3 safest cryptos to invest in”. Btw there also the top three #cryptos in the market right now.... #weak

2787 2018-01-11 20:25:12 $NEBL by far is the best investment I have made! I own 30 different #Crypto and I’d have to say #Neblio is officially my favorite. During the blood bath from last night to this morning, Neblio took a quick dip but overall stayed strong and kept up! Future looks bright  #NEBL

2790 2018-01-11 20:25:03 @serovgsm who do you trust for your crypto trading advice?
2791 2018-01-11 20:25:01 My advice on crypto is to #invest into #Cryptocoin or #Lending Platforms for consistent returns and pile up your money and buy on the next market crash. 

If you don’t like Lending such as #BitConnect then you can #Buy #NEO and #Stake it to #Earn #GAS
2792 2018-01-11 20:24:57 A lot of questions regarding the current blood bath on the market, Korea is investigating unregulated exchanges causing a lot of FUD among traders. I suggest you #HODL and reap the rewards when the market turns green again. STU. #Btc #Crypto #StuToshi
2793 2018-01-11 20:24:30 What is going on in the #Crypto world?! Is this a #cryptocrash ?!
2794 2018-01-11 20:24:28 Create a moment on Twitter, label it crypto or w.e and don’t publish it just save it as a draft. Save your camera roll ;)
2795 2018-01-11 20:24:24 These lists don't matter. You're the best homosapien in the crypto industry.
2796 2018-01-11 20:23:53 When I got into crypto, I didn't buy any coins from fiat. I started with heavy mining research, and then using mining to generate myself coins. Made more sense to me than just converting fiat. It allowed me to research on the functionality and usecase for crypto.
2797 2018-01-11 20:23:48 Thank you love
2798 2018-01-11 20:23:45 Actually looked closer at the whitepaper and still not really convinced about the necessity of this additional token. Also the claim of easy access to crypto is in my opinion already fullfilled by @coinbase etc.
2799 2018-01-11 20:23:43 Wow, such a nice person.  Just having a discussion and you lower your communications style to being rude.  Have a great day.

2804 2018-01-11 20:23:20 It's a bloodbath in the markets.  My trading portfolio is only up 7% today, these level of returns are not the reason I got into Crypto.  For shame @Reuters for shame.
2805 2018-01-11 20:23:19 I understand that part. But you pretty much copied the top three on #CoinMarketCap as the 3 safest. 1#bitcoins future has never seen this much compition. 2 #ripple is fighting a giant lawsuit case right now, how is that safe? And 3 there are Alot more promising #altcoins out now
2806 2018-01-11 20:23:14 if CM hits his predicted number which is 3bn and we've got 202.5 mln supply then you're looking at $14.80 per coin
2807 2018-01-11 20:23:13 What update do you want to hear from them? They have nothing to do with coinmarkets. Number 1 rule in crypto, don't leave your funds on an exchange. This is why. So take this down time to download the wallet, let it sync, and when coinmarkets is back, move your coins to a wallet

リアフレ2人ほど仮想通貨に誘ったのですが、なにも分からない人に仮想通貨について説明するのめちゃめちゃ大変じゃないですか。
2809 2018-01-11 20:23:05 And crypto like btc can duplicated endless times (with different names) and flood the world with electricity wasting mining farms (makes your btc centralised)
Storing it on online wallets (can bee frozen or lost)

And freeze xrp? 
Just a lie of btc enthusiastic people

Try again.
2810 2018-01-11 20:22:59 Decentralized and fast, huge community, atomic swaps and lightning makes it cheap and perfect for a day to day use. I don’t think it’s like Bcash, it is Better in fact.
2811 2018-01-11 20:22:57 @crypto_bobby haha, glad you liked the ripple chart, thanks for the shout-out
2812 2018-01-11 20:22:56 That 1 BTC challenge sounds awesome maybe you can start a new one and let your followers join. Think about it

2815 2018-01-11 20:22:43 Are you coming to the crypto convention in February, it’s in Dallas Texas. Would love to meet you if you are.
2816 2018-01-11 20:22:42 And before ???
2817 2018-01-11 20:22:42 Your calls are awesome bro !!

I guess #ZCL #BTCP (Bitcoin Private Hardfork) should be in your list too.. It is going to be one of the biggest crypto event of the year
2818 2018-01-11 20:22:37 Thank you guys, what you are doing is highly beneficial to the crypto space in general. In 2018, let's do away with centralized exchanges and bring decentralization back in crypto!

2823 2018-01-11 20:21:52 BTC creator unresponsive?? Shit I better dump this. I like coins that rebrand at least once a month.
2824 2018-01-11 20:21:47 $REBL is flying. Staking rewarded with 10% in the @RebelliousCoin wallet. From zero to currently 2200 sats. Going to hodl and stake them!

2826 2018-01-11 20:21:45 Dump it more like the other days
2827 2018-01-11 20:21:42 Have been for months, these dips tho...
2828 2018-01-11 20:21:42 Wil gewoon 25 euro pompen in crypto omdat ik er toch niks mee doe
2829 2018-01-11 20:21:39 Same! Rumours are saying around Jan 20th onwards - what do you think?
2830 2018-01-11 20:21:37 Cierto! Pero ser la crypto del sistema , en mi opinion es la que le da mas fiabilidad. Mas CASH FLOW en cuanto los bancos entren. Las grandes compañías se unen a Ripple. Yo creo que el actual marketcap se va a quedar muy corto este año.
2831 2018-01-11 20:21:29 $PPT & $HVN similar projects I’m in both just look at $PPT and you can see where $HVN can go!

2837 2018-01-11 20:20:51 South Korea bans crypto-currency, prices will continue to drop.
2838 2018-01-11 20:20:48 Welke crypto currency is goed om in te investen
2839 2018-01-11 20:20:42 下いくつまで見るかとりあえず考える
2840 2018-01-11 20:20:38 Should have sold all my #trx and bought all #linda @.006, but since I was hopeful that ship sailed already. #crypto
2841 2018-01-11 20:20:35 Actually problem with this industry is that people on both sides, for and against crypto seem to throw basic critical thinking and integrity out of the window to argue their point. This is Twitter, sure but we should still try and show integrity and respect.
2842 2018-01-11 20:20:31 I only screenshot people saying that crypto will crash so I can come back to them in a year or two and laugh.
2843 2018-01-11 20:20:25 Never heard of it.  It a game of some sort or...?
2844 2018-01-11 20:20:23 Crypto mom 
2845 2018-01-11 20:20:21 Most likely duplicate and triplicate accounts to increase their chances.
2846 2018-01-11 20:20:17 What about Lightning? Will BCH support it?
2847 2018-01-11 20:20:12 Did you not notice your 5x more followers? I like your tweets. Even when you lose you tweet you cut on bearish indicators. Most just pretend it never happened
2848 2018-01-11 20:20:04 Lol. I remember when I used Money Gram to deposit onto PokerStars back in the day. Then came Crypto. Money Gram is irrelevant now. Why would I ever use @MoneyGram to send my money? Don't need the middle man. Why CasinoCoin $CSC will be the future for online gaming.
2849 2018-01-11 20:20:04 Following the escrow plan ensures they keep prices up, while generating income for the company which allows them continuous expansion and development.  They are in this for the long game, not short.  Plus a low value XRP does not let them use xRapid properly.
2850 2018-01-11 20:19:51 typo - "It's more that just crypto"...in sub-head
2851 2018-01-11 20:19:38 Excuse, but you work for Kraken..? I mean, just because defending an update (NOT planified) during ALL the day and the site is even down... a bit strange, isn't it, man..? 
2852 2018-01-11 20:19:36 Yes will consider it for the next time
2853 2018-01-11 20:19:28 ok fine you convinced me I will do overview of TKN
2854 2018-01-11 20:19:26 Buy buy buuuuuy
2855 2018-01-11 20:19:15 Depends on when you got in...
2856 2018-01-11 20:19:12 Also feel like other people doing giveaways should do the same.
2857 2018-01-11 20:19:10 Мне понравилось видео "Crypto Weekly: What is Ripple? Why is Ethereum so slow? ICO tokens being delisted?"
2858 2018-01-11 20:19:09 Yeah sure, but check all the other accounts lol all of them are new and unused and without any tweets and so on and so on
the next time I will pick up you 
2859 2018-01-11 20:19:09 @CryptoKitties by creating cryptokitties as you did, you turned it into a ponzi scheme where early adapters who got their cats for nothing or virtually nothing made a ton while all following were buying worthless graphics of cats. These cats are now the Zimbabwe dollar of crypto

2862 2018-01-11 20:18:52 I cannot think of a single business reason they would want to flood circulation with 55 billion.  There is no win in it for them.
2863 2018-01-11 20:18:51 Eighth!! Yes!!
2864 2018-01-11 20:18:50 Litecoin doesn’t have the fundamentals to 4x IMO. Slower than ripple, equivalent of bitcoin cash. It will 100% depend on them being the first movers to major retailers or payment platforms. Charlie says they have something coming soon, but then again he sold the top!

2876 2018-01-11 20:17:43 .@Kohls gets no credit for helping crypto currency go main stream. I remember "mining" (aka shopping at Kohls) like $50 of Kohls Cash and then trading that in later for a pair of pants. Great investment!
2877 2018-01-11 20:17:41 Banks are scams lol and Thether is a crypto currency that only ever flucates between a few cents above or lower than $1 usd
2878 2018-01-11 20:17:40 Trezor CS is Great!  I always recommend Trezor to my crypto-comrades.
2879 2018-01-11 20:17:33 Not at all, even bought some more on the recent dips. Just meant that I needed to also have a balanced portfolio of altcoins so I can ride the ups and downs.  Just got into crypto a month ago.

2882 2018-01-11 20:17:26 1 to 2 yrs it’s very possible if market presence increases market cap for this could cardano market cap which would put it around 150-200 a coin if it hit ripples market cap it would be at the 1200 range . How is that not believable in the world of crypto ?

2888 2018-01-11 20:17:04 Sure, do it via livestream or make a video showing the selection process. Some oddities about this winner:
1) Account since early 2017 with no activity until January 7 2018
2) Only 7 tweets on the account, all from January 6th 2018
3) Signed up using your Binance referral link
2889 2018-01-11 20:17:02 With binance do you have to buy another crypto (eg eth or btc) and exchange? Or can you deposit money from your bank account and buy crypto?

2900 2018-01-11 20:16:20 @sahelirc Edit your CNBC article apart the South Korean regulator ban on crypto. It was false and is not actually in effect, nor is it planned to be in effect. It is straight up misinformation.
2901 2018-01-11 20:16:20 With TKN you get to hold the private keys to your wallet. No need to trust a third party with your money. NFC payment during first release and will ship cards globally. And that's not even the only things it does better
2902 2018-01-11 20:16:14 Iv not said any thing you haven’t said in your videos . I just s think you would have known about cryptopia if you was well established in crypto . And that’s a fair valid point

2905 2018-01-11 20:16:05 I hope so! I've spent the last 7 days literally sat reading about all different crypto and made my decisions based on informed choices rather than hunches. Who'd have thought making money is addictive 
2906 2018-01-11 20:16:05 Further added to my position in $KMD and $DBC today. Will be riding these to the end of Jan based on my target. Still not too late to enter into a position.

2911 2018-01-11 20:15:49 How many people consider themselves Crypto experts and would be interested in applying to run a small crypto hedge fund $2M-$3M USD?
2912 2018-01-11 20:15:46 Introducing ride sharing with tokens and crypto. Imagine taking the transportation business away from local governments, city, and counties. In a decentralized fashion. Excuse me if I’m lit. @justinsuntron
2913 2018-01-11 20:15:36 Selon Benjamin Griveaux, porte-parole du gouvernement Édouard Philippe, le 10/01/18 à Lyon, la flat tax pourrait s'appliquer au #Bitcoin et autres crypto-monnaies en remplacement de l'imposition actuelle (déclaration en BNC ou BIC, selon dernières infos qui circulent sur Internet

2915 2018-01-11 20:15:35 After playing this 25k for 3h I have decided everyone must have a lot of crypto. #NoOneIsTrying
2916 2018-01-11 20:15:27 I remember Kodak.. From the 80’s.  Thank you for your contribution to film, but crypto looks like you’re trying too hard.
2917 2018-01-11 20:15:26 Es el centro de todos los ataques porque es la crypto del sistema o por lo menos así se le apoda...
2918 2018-01-11 20:15:19 Not ban crypto trading. Formalise exchanges.
2919 2018-01-11 20:15:06 It's a scam friend. Good money is money you earn.
2920 2018-01-11 20:14:59 We definitely have a great CEO and team behind Binance!
2921 2018-01-11 20:14:57 It’s just that banks and government CANNOT intervene. Otherwise, crypto loses its essence. Or? ...
2922 2018-01-11 20:14:53 @Socal_crypto hey bud, where would be a good place to start learning about mining? really want to read up & invest in a rig!

2926 2018-01-11 20:14:34 Size of the team, quality of infrastructure, experience. User growth hasn't been paired with tech growth. Also, the customers are probably different. New crypto traders have less trading knowledge, hence require more tech support
2927 2018-01-11 20:14:31 A model on my Facebook timeline just asked for crypto class recommendations.  

Seriously.
2928 2018-01-11 20:14:29 Can we stop calling it "fork". It's more like a branch off the original chain. A "fork" would suggest both directions would have changed, when the original really stays the same. @Bitcoin @bitcoincash @ltc @ethereumproject
2929 2018-01-11 20:14:29 @JewKorean Dude you are killing it .. 
I guess #ZCL #BTCP (Bitcoin Private Hardfork) should be in your list too.. It is going to be one of the biggest crypto event of the year
2930 2018-01-11 20:14:25 Given that Sanders (and Brihana) never mentioned structuralism (that I know of), I think you are projecting opinions on to them that they dont actually have.
Maybe anti-structuralism is your hammer, and everything is starting to look like a crypto-Marxist nail?

2935 2018-01-11 20:13:58 @crypto_rand any chance that some of these crypto recs will be on bittrex? i get the feeling that those are fewer and much further between than they used to be....

2948 2018-01-11 20:12:51 1/ From a technical standpoint yes I agree. But I also think Economics are not discussed often enough in crypto. Bitcoin's original purpose was to create a *secure* P2P form of digital cash that acts both as a store of value and global currency. Ethereum will never be 'secure' to

2953 2018-01-11 20:12:18 @CoinHodl if you take time out of your already useless day to purposely go into a twitter chain to take jabs or heckle ppl about a subject that you have no interest in whatsoever, you should probably get another hobby besides Crypto and GFY.  BTW that’s called negativity.

2959 2018-01-11 20:11:40 Well done to #ripple this is great news and great news for #cryptocurrency news 
2960 2018-01-11 20:11:39 What is your favorite crypto right now? Talking about the tech behind it.
2961 2018-01-11 20:11:38 For the record, we think the tweets calling for @nathanielpopper's head and firing are a bit much. We would like to see proper disclosure of #crypto conflicts of interest by journalists. The industry has standards for stock and equity holdings, crypto should be no different
2962 2018-01-11 20:11:33 It's not a ban. How lazy is journalism today?

2967 2018-01-11 20:10:58 For every crypto there is a silver lining, hence crypto as a store of value.  See how these so nicely tie together!!??
2968 2018-01-11 20:10:54 Does that make sense? and if that doesnt happen then I'm gonna FOMO chase that bitch!! LOL
2969 2018-01-11 20:10:49 Kind of sad I didn't do more for the $rebl airdrop, could have a lot more tokens. But i am happy with free 700$. Still only the beggining, they started building their own platform, listed on bit-z, don't miss out #crypto $rebl
2970 2018-01-11 20:10:43 Nice pick. The bridge looks as scary and off-the-ground as the whole crypto market....
2971 2018-01-11 20:10:35 Why wrap it? Just write your own crypto!
2972 2018-01-11 20:10:27 What platform do you use for it? Etherdelta or HitBTC?
2973 2018-01-11 20:10:21 These giveaways get shadier every time I see a winner picked without showing how they are selected.
2974 2018-01-11 20:10:21 Only in your case. Get over it already!  Your criminal crony candidate lost!
2975 2018-01-11 20:10:20 I entered also there... then i left like 10% of profolio there to trade fiat pairs... and if i needed some cash i just deposited from there since i already had acount added there. But hey shit happens, i hope not on kraken this time.

2984 2018-01-11 20:09:41 I have some ETN too. Pretty awesome coin.
2985 2018-01-11 20:09:38 If BTC goes on a bull run it wont matter the volume because the satoshi rate has to go down to adjust for the conversion rate. That wont effect the USD value just the satoshi's. Which is why when you see that happen and you look over to the USDT there wont have those REd candles.
2986 2018-01-11 20:09:35 Nope, never won anything. Can I just have $100 worth of crypto please?? Thanks.
2987 2018-01-11 20:09:31 You pencil heads investing in crypto currencies like bitcoin when you could be investing in my love and affection
2988 2018-01-11 20:09:29 imo this kind of crypto wouldn't be acceptable nowadays. RSA key exchange gets you no forward secrecy, you could just have the (furiously obfuscated) closed source skype client make a small mistake handling the user's key and compromise all past and future messages ¯\(°_o)/¯
2989 2018-01-11 20:09:29 *Crypto
2990 2018-01-11 20:09:18 Not a great reason in my opinion. Tokens will encourage innovative businesses like #VIBEhub develop new technology and help them get funding. Their essential to the crypto market.
2991 2018-01-11 20:09:16 "read for yourself", then he posts his website lol
2992 2018-01-11 20:09:09 Math is not your strong point and that is obvious. In addition I would suggest you to read about the myth of market cap but I won’t provide you a link. You as many other need really to start reading... after all it is your money if/which crypto you invest.

2994 2018-01-11 20:08:57 SCAM do not use. Lost $1,000 here because trade exchange will not return funds.
2995 2018-01-11 20:08:57 Keep this up during this terrible time in crypto. But next time get a better room for the interview. Looked like a very cheap room.
2996 2018-01-11 20:08:56 Yeah, but until your Bitcoin transaction has happened you don't own the same funds anymore. You'd sit on your chair waiting if another country has decided to ban Crypto exchanges and if the one you've sent your money to is amongst them.
2997 2018-01-11 20:08:54 BTCが値上がりしていくとき，どの形の投資が有利か：
1. 入金，出金ともビットコイン（TCCなど）
2. 入金，出金ともドル計算（D9, winnex+など）
3. 入金はドル，出金はビットコイン（BitClubなど）

後ほど始めやすい：2,3

3010 2018-01-11 20:07:44 I’m very new to crypto, is there an exchange that will sell KWHCOINS in the ico phase?
3011 2018-01-11 20:07:44 Amazing how illegal this would be if you guys were talking about publicly traded stocks and you were brokers. 150 years of shady market practices on full display in the crypto world.
3012 2018-01-11 20:07:36 How long its going to take for this maintenance. It is too long. Looks like whole day it is down. Not good

3016 2018-01-11 20:07:35 I expect Q1-Q2 of 2018 to be the biggest surge in the cryptocurrency market we have seen yet, not every crypto in the top 10 will be a part of this. 

From Q3 onwards we should be seeing a correction much larger than this weeks, 50% - 70% is very possible.
3017 2018-01-11 20:07:35 I’m heavily in but it didn’t start this way. Outside of crypto I have a paycheck and a lot of debt. Slowly using crypto gains to eliminate that debt.

3028 2018-01-11 20:06:35 Do you really think BTC - or any other crypto - will replace the world banking system in your lifetime? Or your kids? Or your grand-kids?

Aint happening my friend. You are a pretty smart guy but make yourself somewhat useful and coming back to reality.

Hi Nick
I have recently started to invest in Crypto an Bitcoin and have watched loads of your videos. But the Messed Up ! apology lifted my heart mate, BRILLIANT it is so nice to see someone being honest these days. I opened a twitter account so I could send 
3034 2018-01-11 20:06:00 I fail to see how Lightning is going to suddenly make the average new crypto investor smarter or lower their greed/FOMO emotions.  I think the SEC is more likely, eventually, to have more impact on lowing demand for altcoins.

3038 2018-01-11 20:05:49 6. In the past few days, the South Korean authorities and government officials have been holding talks with their Japanese and Chinese counterparts in order to formulate new rules for regulating cryptocurrency operations in the country. #crypto #taxes #Korea

3042 2018-01-11 20:05:30 This marks the day I joined Twitter, all because of Crypto Currencies.  Let's make this an awesome year!
3043 2018-01-11 20:05:28 I feel that when these developers realize the positive potential $TRX can have with Alibaba they will have Ma's ear with attention. Im sure these dev. left in good terms and will only be go for Tron in the short and long term. IMHO
3044 2018-01-11 20:05:24 5.  The regulators indicated at the time that they were looking into whether the banks are complying with their anti-money laundering (AML) obligations when transacting with cryptocurrency exchanges.#crypto #taxes #Korea

3050 2018-01-11 20:05:03 The good news is that you don't need to tackle all the verticals I listed in order to contribute. The UX side of crypto (for the most part) is deplorable. So learning enough about the space such that you can build out more user-friendly experiences is a huge value-add

3054 2018-01-11 20:04:49 4. Earlier this week, six unnamed banks in South Korea were scrutinized by the Korean Financial Intelligence Unit and the Financial Supervisory Service for their relationship with the country's bitcoin exchange ecosystem.#crypto #taxes #Korea
3055 2018-01-11 20:04:48 @CryptoChoe do you plan on accepting any crypto as payment for your site?
3056 2018-01-11 20:04:45 I also started on Kraken but they literally forced me to move to other exchanges. Fortunately this types of exchanges are just entry/exit from fiat to crypto and vice versa. I dont use them for trading :)

3068 2018-01-11 20:03:47 Wow! I started following few weeks ago because I’d like to learn more about #Crypto but most of your tweets is depreciating #Ripple and all others #Altcoins  Why are you so worried about ripple? It’s quite weird... You are totally obsessed with it. Come on! Don’t worry, be happy!

3075 2018-01-11 20:02:56 To be honest, I asked because you are shouting like crazy with only owning 5k. This is exactly what spreads the FUD and drives down the price. People who are serious in investing in Crypto use you as an example to not invest in TRX, because the community is filled with you guys.

3090 2018-01-11 20:02:18 An alternative to move crypto to fiat and back, preferably with SEPA?

3097 2018-01-11 20:01:24 The original reason for OneThing demand was the current crypto craze - they were giving people Wanke Coins to share bandwidth which users would exchange for yuan - clearly violating China rules on cryptocurrencies. $XNET

3193 2018-01-11 19:54:38 crypto twitter seems to think credit card networks are this gleaming towards of ten million supercomputers but i'm pretty sure US banking still runs on a significant amount of dialup and ftp
3194 2018-01-11 19:54:37 Good shit brotha, thanks for the follow!
3195 2018-01-11 19:54:34 In the last 18 months we’ve seen hype around AI, ML, VR, AR, and finally, Bitcoin/Blockchain. 

You know why I believe in it? It has influenced GOVERNMENTS to take action. 

#Crypto has moved SLOW. ASS. GOVERNMENTS.
3196 2018-01-11 19:54:26 Hey, I keep hearing about this coin called DIP but I can't find it anywhere. do you guys know where I can buy DIP?
3197 2018-01-11 19:54:18 $xrp appears to be slowly collapsing. The pending $12b lawsuit will definitely cause a major selloff eventually. This is not good Ripple holders. 

#Bitcoin appears to actually be a safe investment in this tumultuous crypto climate. Invest wisely!

3204 2018-01-11 19:53:52 BTC and ETH will always be up in the top. It's funny how no one has mentioned ADA. Overvalued? I think so...
3205 2018-01-11 19:53:49 1/ My take on the Kodak thing is that someone in Kodak is deep crypto and they have staged a coup. It’s easy to assume that this is just a cynical attempt to leverage blockchain. But what are the odds that not one person in that company was early in bitcoin and is now a whale.

3207 2018-01-11 19:53:41 I don’t think he’s talking about a “space” (outer space) company. Sounds like he is referring to a company who is innovative in THIS space, i.e. the crypto/blockchain space.

3209 2018-01-11 19:53:33 Seriously, @sahelirc should be fired. People actually believe your half-ass hit pieces and folks like me have to spend time making sure people don't lose money because of the #FUD you cause. Should be ashamed of yourself. Stop writing about crypto.

3211 2018-01-11 19:53:28 Because that is the image each portrays through their names and portraits, feel free to tell me which name and picture I've read wrong though. If Crypto is to be revolutionary it must also confront gender bias in tech.
3212 2018-01-11 19:53:14 New dev from alibaba, new announcement coming up....$TRX, come on. Why r we still at 850.....This coin is going to explode like an orgasm. Just two strokes.

3214 2018-01-11 19:53:00 well i guess in crypto it just takes the stress out knowing u havent lost a penny especially during big dropps! selling to south korea is difficult. its easy to transfer xrp and sell but cashing out is impossible unless u have friends there but they have very strict laws
3215 2018-01-11 19:53:00 Your mcm think he know a whole lot about crypto currency because he be following bitcoin on the coinbase app .... steve is your mcm

3224 2018-01-11 19:52:08 Basically! haha
3225 2018-01-11 19:51:59 Ya its seems like every crypto nerd and youtuber thinks they r smarter than these businesses and financial institutions.
3226 2018-01-11 19:51:46 I understood that $XRP #Ripple is not a real coin. Having partnerships with bank and Amex... This is not the “crypto philosophy”, right? Otherwise, please explain me!
3227 2018-01-11 19:51:44 Here is a prediction, @civickey will run up in the next 4 hours and then crash because @VinnyLingham talks about everything but #CVC. What ever @RonnieMoas suggests, do the opposite and you'll make tons of money. @BKBrianKelly/@CNBC will pretend to have a clue about crypto.
3228 2018-01-11 19:51:42 I had a binance account open, never used it. But this morning I transferred funds from coinbase to buy during the #xrp drop since Kraken was down. It was quick and the trades were very fast unlike kraken, im getting out of Kraken when its up.

3240 2018-01-11 19:50:38 Mainstream media only discusses #Crypto if the gains are too big to ignore, or if there is any downward trend for more than a couple of hours.
3241 2018-01-11 19:50:30 atleast your twitter name explains this situation
3242 2018-01-11 19:50:30 We are still in the early stages of crypto, it's die-hard and not pragmatic to select a crypto coin when there's so much volatility with them, common sense says usdt
3243 2018-01-11 19:50:28 Do you will adds on Ledger another crypto in 2018?
3244 2018-01-11 19:50:27 That's one of the biggest problems with crypto. People forget that these are *software* (FOSS) projects.  This is like giving awards to sports talk people and not the actual athletes on the field that make all the magic happen.
3245 2018-01-11 19:50:23 Made enough to pay off all of my debt, so I sold everything and am out of the crypto game, for now.

3260 2018-01-11 19:49:16 Look at TKS. It has huge growth potential. They are doing things  other  companies in their space are not doing and they are keeping up  with  them!. Only a matter of time before it takes off, it's only on  Bittrex  and WAVES right now and WAVES is too complicated.
3261 2018-01-11 19:49:08 Coding is only one (and arguably small) part of being an engineer in crypto. Lots of dense topics to cover: consensus algorithms, distributed systems engineering, public key cryptography, networking, etc.

Start with one layer of that onion and keep peeling.
3262 2018-01-11 19:49:08 Same could be said about the crypto tweeting 
3263 2018-01-11 19:49:00 Leído recién en el trabajo:

Just called the Director of Technology for a current trial. "Sorry, I just quit my job. That's what happens when you make millions in crypto." LOL
3264 2018-01-11 19:48:54 It feels like a measure of how far and long we've allowed fiat currency to masquerade as money that even a joke crypto is worth so much.

3270 2018-01-11 19:48:16 @JoelKatz what's the likelihood of xrp evolving into a p2p or p2b crypto currency?
3271 2018-01-11 19:48:15 not too bad when i started i had 1 investment went to 2x and took my original 1 out in time so money in crypto now is my profit only thx god!!

3273 2018-01-11 19:48:15 I doubt it, Bluetooth in nature seems to offer point-to-point transmissions of such type.  The basic text layer is broadcast but pairing the device creates a point-to-point link of some kind between a device and transmitter using crypto.

3322 2018-01-11 19:44:57 there was a python tutorial/crypto market study that examined changes in market behavior over 2016/2017 that concluded that prop shops were working to maintain parity. also noticed increasingly alt coins follow more closely their dollar value rather than btc as they did prior.

3338 2018-01-11 19:44:13 Well you're definately in the lead jab-wise! Maybe you're right about the exposure it gives Tron but don't underestimate your powers Mr. Lee. You are highly respected in the crypto community and with that comes great responsibility. Thanks for taking the time
3339 2018-01-11 19:44:12 Smart money.

3341 2018-01-11 19:43:48 Above any other development in crypto should be the development of DEX.
3342 2018-01-11 19:43:41 Comment about a project that crosses gaming and crypto. Don't really want to say what but ... touches both lands.
3343 2018-01-11 19:43:39 From 5ML users , they are 90%  pump and dump users !!!! , let’s say congracts Binance for the 10% who they understand the concept of the crypto Currency.
3344 2018-01-11 19:43:28 and as we've discussed... fiat currency is the real enemy and when that goes away, so will the power of the entities who produce and manipulate it... the future that we all hope for requires a transition period where current institutions exist alongside crypto... for now at least
3345 2018-01-11 19:43:28 Happy days then haha
3346 2018-01-11 19:43:28 I'm finally about to purchase some of this crypto currency, let's see what happens.
3347 2018-01-11 19:43:27 Crypto currency folks anyone have any tips time to start building the wallet
3348 2018-01-11 19:43:26 Something tells me behind this crypto account you are a absolute freak haha

3349 2018-01-11 19:43:15 Not really. I’m putting my $MUE into crypto-sleep mode. Just mining and accumulating. Masternode are going to be hot this year. Good to be very early on $MUE.
3350 2018-01-11 19:43:10 Kind of a noob statement from someone with such a big pool of followers.

3357 2018-01-11 19:42:38 Ver is not a developer. Maybe you can explain why a PR guy for a crypto you clearly don’t even hold is more of a problem to the community than the lead developer of Blockstream who insists on keeping tabs with merchants as a solution to high fees.
3358 2018-01-11 19:42:34 Amazing isn’t it!  Too many novices in crypto...
3359 2018-01-11 19:42:16 @get_delta any chance you guys are working on integrating a passcode for the app?

You wanna help someone out, pick a random person and do some good with your Crypto gains. That will help the ‘reasons’ out more than trolling XRP ppl for trying to do something. @ reasons

If all the companies start doing this, there must be a impact on the Govt because the usage of actual currency will be reduced.

3378 2018-01-11 19:40:50 Crypto-Currency and the philosophy behind it is straight up steam punk.

3385 2018-01-11 19:40:24 Its not like financial institutions and expertise are being rendered worthless.  They are being rendered honest.  I would bet that some of the high level economic talent in banking and monetary policy is welcoming the discipline that bitcoin is bringing.

Or stop thinking like a brainwashed twat... crypto was invented to be decentralised. they cant stop it.

3408 2018-01-11 19:38:46 Close over 880 would set up a run to 1240 nice and slow would prime a run to 2400s, a moon shot like you said would cause the dump again and restart.

3445 2018-01-11 19:35:56 Bitcoin Cash is represented by literally the most obnoxious and outspoken person in all of crypto, who also happens to be the primary beneficiary if it succeeds. The coinbase debacle is a microcosm of that huge glaring problem
3446 2018-01-11 19:35:55 the world of crypto currency is actively growing, so I believe in you and see the potency

3449 2018-01-11 19:35:42 I like how financial experts are thinking bitcoin is under pressure when the money is actually just flowing into alts and shitcoins. You can't talk about crypto if you're not living it everyday.

3471 2018-01-11 19:34:06 I think those caught up in the retail stock bust in 2001 were scared off for a while (weren’t chief victims of the GFC). Similarly the cohort invested in crypto will be psychologically impaired for quite a while
3472 2018-01-11 19:34:03 Given the absurd fashion to put crypto currencies into everything, I wonder how much we are undoing all the hard work over the last few decades in reducing unnecessary energy use.

3481 2018-01-11 19:33:25 They will add what makes them money. They have no rule for crypto's only. If they see that XRP will be profitable, they will add it. If not, then they won't. Just like everything else.

Hey mate, I recently made mad gains with DNR, STAK, LUX and BWK in my mining game. I'm wondering if you could recommend me a tiny markrket cap project that would be worth mining too for a long term?

I sold STAK at "only" 10 usd, mcfuckingkillme.jpg.

3532 2018-01-11 19:30:55 The ico isn't even available in the US. It's one thing supporting bitconnect but this coin is a joke.
3533 2018-01-11 19:30:53 they purchased crypto mining rigs 2-3 days ago, for sure something to do with that.
3534 2018-01-11 19:30:51 Past two days shook out most of the weak hands and panic sellers. Long term? Good thing for crypto. Short term? Brace for FOMO on the turnaround.
3535 2018-01-11 19:30:49 Crypto got me shook this might be the greatest thing ever known to man and there is still something coming that will be bigger than bitcoin

Go.
3553 2018-01-11 19:29:35 Nope, they are both undervalued....you will see what I mean by the beginning of 2019. $NEO is definitely more undervalued though, but not for long.
3554 2018-01-11 19:29:34 or Monero, or Verge, etc.  The anonymous coin market is getting crowded
3555 2018-01-11 19:29:32 maybe an active Reddit account would be beneficial?
3556 2018-01-11 19:29:29 overheard the men in our local brexit pub talking about it at lunch. went from talking about decimalisation to crypto. i shit you not.

3558 2018-01-11 19:29:18 That appears to be the case lol. But as a non shiller with few followers, $HVN is legit. The coin definitely will go to $1-$2 in the short term. A major exchange listing is happening this quarter, more than likely it is Binance.

3563 2018-01-11 19:28:50 Banks will be using Ripple Labs.

Xrp is a token Ripple Labs created to scam you out of your crypto.

3572 2018-01-11 19:28:27 hey w8 .. u upload a video few hours saying that ur think about selling all ur xrp ... and now ur saying "Y'all are dumb" you look more "volatile" than crypto. (btw i hold xrp) and yesterday i just bought more when "y'all" went crazy.
3573 2018-01-11 19:28:20 I'm interested in your first point (i don't quite follow), but it seems like the barrier to switching crypto is either useful, e.i. different coins for different things, or is solved by atomic swaps
3574 2018-01-11 19:28:17 Waiting for this transfer to hit my @RevolutApp so I can spend it on crypto 
3575 2018-01-11 19:28:16 I have been watching and reasurching the crypto market. I like the way people panic so easily the slightest bit of negative news causes such uncertainty people panic sell. All you end up with is dips where non panicked people buy very astute
3576 2018-01-11 19:28:07 Paccoin is going to surge when no one is expecting it , have a great volume, now trading at $0.000121.  I do believe Dogecoin, Paccoin are the outsiders to  invest NOW !

3584 2018-01-11 19:27:16 Humans and money has always been a complex relationship over ages. Unintended side effect of crypto - we can now observe this relationship at a global level, it is now for all to see and it is at a fast enough timescale that our short-term memory can process.

3593 2018-01-11 19:26:28 incorrect; the problem isn't going away until all people in the world have access to high speed web + smartphones in underdeveloped regions... then people can be their own banks via crypto... thank God that you have never been poor my dude... it changes your perspective for sure
3594 2018-01-11 19:26:26 
3595 2018-01-11 19:26:22 the project looks good but there is only 4 people i saw in charge on their road map. the road map looks good btw. can you elaborate more why you choose this coin. the liquidity part is great for small business in the future but it seem it need more personal.

3605 2018-01-11 19:25:43 $KODK RULE #1 of shorting: Don’t short a stock with a low float, high volume, and in crypto. Especially that it’s $KODK not a random company.

Kodakcoin is huge, protecting photographers all over world. Don’t focus on the mining machines they released. This is about Kodakcoin.
3606 2018-01-11 19:25:35 So, you are right that nothing has been done yet, but this panic wouldn't have spread around the world and in SK on fake news.  I think they are looking for a reason to ban or severely restrict crypto, or at least send a shot across the bow.

3613 2018-01-11 19:24:49 Als jij denkt dat dat meer dan 1% rendement per jaar oplevert, ja. Met je reeds behaalde crypto rendementen kan je al 250 jaar vooruit. Ofzo.

3624 2018-01-11 19:23:41 @Kodak is dipping it's toes into the crypto craze with an ICO #KodakCoin to utilize #blockchain in a novel way to help photographers keep control of their work. Good move Jeff Clarke.
3625 2018-01-11 19:23:37 Sigh. The ledger has been renamed to 'XRP ledger' a couple of months ago to hook into the crypto bull market. Only a small fraction of activity on it is related to XRP at all. The USD value transacted per day on ledger is not even 10% of ETH, and only a small fraction is XRP.
3626 2018-01-11 19:23:36 Hello everybody,
If you have KNC Titans you want to get rid of, I'm ready to buy them !
3627 2018-01-11 19:23:36 Devlet destekli mi acaba?
3628 2018-01-11 19:23:24 shocked its not a crypto ico
3629 2018-01-11 19:23:23 — You know what Bitcoin is, right?
— Yeah
— So, Bitcoin Cash is a new Bitcoin but a lower tier one

Overheard at a Chinese restaurant coming from a table of granny-looking white women while I'm waiting for my food. The crypto fever is real.
3630 2018-01-11 19:23:18 Stel je investeert het bedrag dat je anders extra aflost in crypto, dan zou dit theoretisch gezien veel rendabeler zijn toch?
3631 2018-01-11 19:23:02 Imagine a crypto where everyone that purchased some coins originally didn’t sell any of them ? Wouldn’t that be amazing, it would most definitely skyrocket the price of said coin as we all know how supply and demand works. This market is NO EXCEPTION !!
3632 2018-01-11 19:22:57 (2/4) A big part of this has to do with how we structured the review process and the introduction of crypto tokens/coins in a new discipline known as cryptoeconomics.
3633 2018-01-11 19:22:57 Renseigne toi sur ripple, je vois plein de potentiel dans cette société qui va permettre de faire des virements en une micro seconde. Elle utilisera sa propre crypto monnaie : xrp. Malgré qu'on lise l'inverse dans les médias.
3634 2018-01-11 19:22:54 Was it just me or did anyone else notice that Tom Lee @Fundstrat didn't have a word to say about crypto on @CNBC this afternoon? Interesting
3635 2018-01-11 19:22:53 All in for the 23rd bringing a guy that dabbles in the crypto markets
3636 2018-01-11 19:22:35 $TRX $tron -  a slow ride to the moon
3637 2018-01-11 19:22:32 Not saying that negligence isn't a factor sometimes. But crypto exchanges probably get way more DDOS attacks than IBKR. It also must be very hard to run 24/7 trading without a maintenance window
3638 2018-01-11 19:22:31 I am not sure crypto community needs this clown.
3639 2018-01-11 19:22:28 Right now is a great time to buy when the market is so bullish. My top picks are the following #ethereum #XVG #trx #Kin #XRP #zcl #dash pick it up while it's low!

#crypto #Cryptocurrency #HODL
3640 2018-01-11 19:22:01 No I meant how did you know
3641 2018-01-11 19:21:57 Le mec est même pas au courant que le bitcoin c'est juste une crypto et qu'il y en a 1400. Des pourries et des géniales.
3642 2018-01-11 19:21:56 Chalo acha hai. Aur crypto mein paise daale fir
3643 2018-01-11 19:21:44 @Haejin_Crypto 
hello haejin trx what is your comment?
3644 2018-01-11 19:21:42 But you are still invested in Crypto? Or you want to stay invested despite knowing Buffet is right? I am invested in Crypto and I think Buffet will be right first and then eventually wrong, very wrong.
3645 2018-01-11 19:21:35 Yes XLM was going to do a major correction, (And it did) But what I'm saying is sticking with XLM should be more of a long time goal. I truly believe that XLM will be a major player in the Crypto world. IMHO
3646 2018-01-11 19:21:34 That's real friendship.  Most of my friends told me to stay away from crypto cos it's too risky  lol   I wonder what they will spend their 1% returns on
3647 2018-01-11 19:21:32 Loved they show & for letting us in on your chat.  Can you discuss that y’all think about government ability to ban crypto next show?  I’d love to hear your thoughts.

3650 2018-01-11 19:21:21 I would love to see $IDK $IDK.CA rip to a buck right about now. Then sell and dump that cash into some nice crypto and tech plays which have dipped from their highs. So much opportunity on this market. I have loaded all I want on $FTEC $SLXXF $PKK $PKKFF and $LVI $LVI.CA
3651 2018-01-11 19:21:12 2/ I think it’s a good idea if you want to diversify a little profit away from #crypto but still keep your same anti-dollar thesis.  I like the miners which are very depressed. I’ve posted on $GG before.  Would love to hear other ideas in the space. $GDXJ is the junior miners etf
3652 2018-01-11 19:21:12 Just bought some #0x and #GNT #golem both have good signals to go up. No moon talk, I don't mess around with that. Good products, doing well. #cryptocurrency #crypto
3653 2018-01-11 19:21:10 What's crypto without some volatility 
3654 2018-01-11 19:21:07 Women of #Bitcoin, I humbly ask that you accept my @MorphToken co-founder @bitxnic among your crypto-ranks. She knows crypto-things. @Melt_Dem @conniegallippi @e_rossiello @starkness @victoriavaneyk @paigefreeman
3655 2018-01-11 19:21:07 If you’re not part of more than one group chat called “Crypto Fuckbois” then you’re probably doing ok
3656 2018-01-11 19:21:00 A normal week in the life of Crypto..
3657 2018-01-11 19:20:59 Buffett has a flip phone. Nuff said. #crypto
3658 2018-01-11 19:20:59 Crypto prince  #ltc #xrp #btc #eth
3659 2018-01-11 19:20:58 I THINK @justinsuntron #trx is goin to partner with @SpaceX and if they do, later on maybe @Tesla will join :) Both companies related to @elonmusk. Decentralized internet and crypto/blockchain will have a lot of value for them in the future!! #trx #btc
3660 2018-01-11 19:20:57 Which $crypto token projects achieve the following?

1. Token offers more equal participation to the value of the community than equity?

2. Token solves a problem that can't be easily solved by using dollars?

3. The token has an obvious use case beyond trading?
3661 2018-01-11 19:20:51 All your crypto are belong to us.
3662 2018-01-11 19:20:39 Anyone who just blindly takes ANYONES trade advice shouldn't be in crypto. What does he expect you to do? Hold his hand and walk him through his trades? If I were you I'd tell people like this that tether will be the next huge alt.
3663 2018-01-11 19:20:32 Well good thing Ripple and XRP have nothing to do with Crypto and why u got into it. It never has.
3664 2018-01-11 19:20:32 Toi arrête de parler quand tu connais rien à la crypto
3665 2018-01-11 19:20:31 Thanks SIr! HODLING
3666 2018-01-11 19:20:24 Yea it's just because it's a decent issue with the app. I had this happen to a different app I had unrelated to crypto too.
3667 2018-01-11 19:20:19 It is nearly impossible to get crypto or cash into the exchange in less than 5-6 days right now. There is a serious liquidity problem at gatehub.
3668 2018-01-11 19:20:15 Ven is backed by China gov. $ven is partnered with bitocean a crypto atm solution. & building a platform to build icos on. Need I say more
3669 2018-01-11 19:20:08 Aren't you describing fiat, not crypto? Doesn't crypto *inherently* have more utility than fiat with things like decentralization, censorship resistance, borderlessness(?), inextricably built in?
3670 2018-01-11 19:20:00 $40?
3671 2018-01-11 19:19:59 if ur in Socal r u on the tier elec more u use more it cost ? im in Al now & its only $.11  kWh all u can use i think it may be profitable for me again ? need to fully research it though, whats ur thoughts ?

3673 2018-01-11 19:19:57 Arrête de dire de la merde. Qui a perdu quoi avec le bitcoin ? Celui qui a acheté à 20k la c'est 14k....et ça va remonter. Déplus il n'y a pas que le bitcoin  il  y a 1400 crypto monnaies.
3674 2018-01-11 19:19:55 Preferably using Dragonmint miners and NOT Bitmain miners. 
3675 2018-01-11 19:19:46 Scale by Geoffrey West. Explores the fundamental nature of scaling, why everything in the universe is the size that it, scaling properties of organisms, networks, cities, and companies. A book that made me go “holy shit” every other page.

3679 2018-01-11 19:19:28 Hey @JanVertonghen I noticed you're into crypto?
3680 2018-01-11 19:19:23 Work hard. Crypto is not an easy game. I spend almost 18 hours a day reading up on trends/graphs/news and so forth. Nothing comes easy in life. 
Just like in Poker, you gotta know when to fold them, gotta know when to HODL them
3681 2018-01-11 19:19:21 And no, I have some principles when it comes to crypto.
3682 2018-01-11 19:19:16 Merci pour les informations !
3683 2018-01-11 19:18:56 1人でもいて嬉しい、とか言ってもらえてるし！

3686 2018-01-11 19:18:36 Hey man, I'm a US Navy guy who got into crypto last March and got involved in a very tight knit group of 40 investors who have ALL excelled immensely. I'd like to think I'm pretty knowledgeable. I think the story of my group is pretty interesting!

3688 2018-01-11 19:18:33 daily notes a few times a week ... a few dozen stock and crypto recommendations during the year
3689 2018-01-11 19:18:33 That might be driven by culturally praising wealth. I was talking about how stupid is 4 anyone, specially middle class to invest in crypto currency and the ppl most upset were the ones with most chances to get screwed. We all love to think we can get rich, and wealth = happines
3690 2018-01-11 19:18:32 Begint wat momentum opwaarts te komen. Even in de gaten houden voor breakout nu?
3691 2018-01-11 19:18:17 327 developer teams from all over the world have signed into the $NEO + #Microsoft development competition! #NEO is on the brink of becoming a very big deal.  Peace and love everybody

3692 2018-01-11 19:18:16 Why crypto exchanges are so much worse than the likes of Etrade + Interactive Brokers in terms of network and uptime?

I get that there's more to consider as a crypto exchange (e.g. custody) and that infra / standards are less mature, but uptime should not be this big a problem.
3693 2018-01-11 19:18:14 $BTC #crypto

3694 2018-01-11 19:18:11 Where do you go to short crypto?
3695 2018-01-11 19:17:45 Been interested in Cryptopia as an exchange. How would you rate your experience with them?
3696 2018-01-11 19:17:44 this is correct
3697 2018-01-11 19:17:44 Update on last night’s crypto thread about KR FUD, everyone sold their stakes in coins I was in and I closed my eyes and slept, holding my coins. The main coin I’m in went up almost 200% overnight as the FUD settled. I’m a prophet for the profit baby
3698 2018-01-11 19:17:39 On peut donner un équivalent en eth khey ? Ça évitera pas mal de frais 
3699 2018-01-11 19:17:31 Kraken is hacked! They are just scared to admit and looking for a remedy!
3700 2018-01-11 19:17:14 In the crypto community, Roger Ver is viewed as a scam artist and opportunist... Bcash is not the real BitCoin...
3701 2018-01-11 19:17:11 #ICO model is only scarce and successful because it gives access to normal people easily purchase tokens of companies they might perceive as innovative with potential. #Blockchain really has really little to do with such #crypto boom from perspective of public appeal and mindset

3711 2018-01-11 19:16:29 I hope new Pelevin's book will be about #bitcoin. This is a juicy topic to cover for someone like @ViktorPelevin
3712 2018-01-11 19:16:25 good potential hives and delivers promises ..value for money
3713 2018-01-11 19:16:14 When $xrp 10$?

3715 2018-01-11 19:16:05 how do you know it's March 1st?
3716 2018-01-11 19:15:50 An excellent idea, I hope that in the near future to pay for purchases of crypto currency will also be easy as a fiat

3727 2018-01-11 19:15:12 Whole crypto currency thing is based on blockchain, everything is "copy" of blockchain!
3728 2018-01-11 19:15:11 Not true. It has already quintupled 2 separate times and each correction has stabilized at a higher level than before these massive gains. Every single #crypto on the market does the same thing, but most of them don't quintuple in a week, twice.
3729 2018-01-11 19:15:09 Still waiting for my Coin metro confirmation email
3730 2018-01-11 19:15:04 @diyaz_ludba I apologize for all the crypto investors. Dbix should be trading over $100usd and someday $1,500 which is 2.7 billion cap. I don't think people read your twitter because they are idiots. Once you are on Bittrex and Binance real investors will know your value. $dbix
3731 2018-01-11 19:14:54 I sold my ripple already. Hit it hard.
3732 2018-01-11 19:14:39 Is it true that Reliance is coming up with its own crypto?  #jiocoin #Cryptocurrency

3734 2018-01-11 19:14:30 I already tried similar processes and even went as far as stop smoking for 3 months or so but I came back to it. I'm actually looking for some medicinal help to go along with it. But I appreciate your advice :)
3735 2018-01-11 19:14:28 sorry $XRP shilling (the scam token not @Ripple its self) is disgraceful and goes against the reason I got into crypto in the first place.
3736 2018-01-11 19:14:27 The SK gov has mentioned regulating crypto and going after people trying to evade taxes.. did CNBC just get acquired by Fox?
3737 2018-01-11 19:14:23 This is GREAT news!  Awesome to see #VergeFam growing. Everybody needs access to this exceptional #crypto. #Verge is king in #privacy and privacy = #freedom!  Way to go $XVG!
3738 2018-01-11 19:14:21 btw yes i am mad someone made a crypto joke
3739 2018-01-11 19:14:20 Personally, I think supporting only Solidity (or something that compiles to it), for now, is the right decision. Languages which aren't built to be memory-friendly are going to make smart contracts terribly expensive to execute.
3740 2018-01-11 19:14:18 bought crypto currency and gained $3.24 in my sleep.... i swear you broke boys can’t relate
3741 2018-01-11 19:14:14 Love your channel, but your comment "they have the ability to freeze a person's account or freeze the entire network at will" regarding #XRP is completely false. Would be cool if you could clarify this in future.

but i always browse reddit instead and look at the charts on the daily to remind myself, "that could be you but it isn't bc you lazy"
3749 2018-01-11 19:13:29 These suit and tie picture twitter crypto investors aren’t even subtle that they insider trade. “Something huge is coming, just picked up a huge bag of X.” Really? No news broke, nothing on the roadmap. Then if it doesn’t pan out... “Man I hate being lied to!”

3752 2018-01-11 19:13:20 Kucoin  and Ethereum  Network  is a fantastic  combination of  two major entities  of  crypto  world  which leads to tremendous success in year 2018.
3753 2018-01-11 19:13:15 Seriously
3754 2018-01-11 19:13:14 It is ironic that a statement by a authority or a renowned investor makes such an impact on the crypto world.cryptos are disrupting the financial ecosystem and any thing that is disruptive faces resistance so will crypto! there is lot more to come stay calm #cryptocurrency #BTC
3755 2018-01-11 19:13:13 Competition is much needed to bring up crypto space. Chrome would not be existing if Google would have thought Internet Explorer, Firefox is already popular and doing similar thing. But I agree there should be references in the document if it it "referred".
3756 2018-01-11 19:12:57 A whole new phenomenon now exists in Millennial Land and its on a whole other level of annoyingness...

3757 2018-01-11 19:12:53 i see a new phase  starting of cryptocurrency. From here either crypto market will grow heavily or it will end drastically. But a shift from bitcoin core to bitcoincash can do something better in future. Untill we have alts independent of btc these scenario will be seen regularly

3768 2018-01-11 19:12:18 I believe the term you are looking for is market manipulation, which would only be a crime for regulated securities.
3769 2018-01-11 19:12:10 I'm gonna copy this message of yours and paste it in our telegram group. Love what your doing! And if you ever want to donate me some mint (that's beside verge my top crypto) just let me know :)
3770 2018-01-11 19:12:05 خبر موني جرام الاخير ممكن يشجع المستثمرين مع انه مثل ماقلت ممكن اذا زاد عدد العملات بيساهم في نزول العملة وهذا الموضوع الي كثير مايعرفونه ان هذه العملة pre-mined يعني الشركة على كيفها تنزل كل فترة عدد محدد من العملات ، والله يخارجنا من هالبنوك ،،،،
3771 2018-01-11 19:11:55 Only coin I made a profit on today, but we still need to survive when the Asians wake up and start trading again, or shall I say, selling.....
3772 2018-01-11 19:11:52 the only reason i wish i got into crypto earlier is so at this point i could chase that feeling of losing a million dollars in a few minutes
3773 2018-01-11 19:11:40 Best advise
3774 2018-01-11 19:11:36 Siam Bank + Axis just confirmed they’re going to be implementing XRP. You did a half-assed research job and published some trash as a result. 0 credibility left if you had any to start with. Nobody is going to you guys for crypto news that’s for sure.

3777 2018-01-11 19:11:29 It just cracks me up that people just #FUD over #xrp even in reply to a statement released by #moneygram  in which they clearly state the use of #xrp So #fudsters are moneygram lying or do you just autotweet the same thing everytime #ripple and #xrp are tweeted? #XRPthestandard
3778 2018-01-11 19:11:29 In that case all the crypto currencies with real use cases need to be decoupled from btc.
3779 2018-01-11 19:11:19 Mind you I was shocked that my copy of crypto is 16yrs old! ... Sorry I'm not helping at all am I!

“South Korea would never pull out of the crypto market...”
“OMG, f*^% you, South Korea!  Sell, sell, sell!”
“I’ll buy a little... and see if the market goes back up?”
“We’re all doomed!!!”
“At least China isn’t pulling out.”

3788 2018-01-11 19:10:48 I bought last night and sold out in front of the huge sell wall for minimal profit. Oh well, next time. :) Appreciate the calls and the insight. Have to keep in mind these take some time to play out. Good test to get my feet wet tho, given this is my first time round the block.

3792 2018-01-11 19:10:35 At worst, they're crypto-nationalists. But they really aren't. Most of the Kurdish rank and file doesn't really understand what Apoism is, and probably joined out of Kurdish 'patriotism', but the leadership are genuine pluralists.

3807 2018-01-11 19:09:40 No problem. I am operating on the assumption that most people getting into crypto now are just speculating in the short term, especially if one of their “investment” ideas involve $USDT

The system is meant to enslave us.

3821 2018-01-11 19:08:53 Crypto currency is going to make those companies obsolete. One of the whole points of decentralized currency is to eliminate 3rd parties. Why use western union when you can send directly to someone's wallet.

3824 2018-01-11 19:08:34 Hey why  is everyone so pessimistic about verge, which delivers something what no one else does, anonymity! Fast transactions too. Now think about, this year will be pumped so much money in cryptos, because the big playas start trading in crypto too.

3855 2018-01-11 19:06:48 Wealth is holding #BitcoinCash. And #BitcoinCash is following the true vision of #Bitcoin, peer-to-peer electronic cash that cannot be taken away. That is WEALTH. Plus it's just fun to use!

3857 2018-01-11 19:06:42 Great strategy for long term. You’ll sacrifice a lot of gains that way in the short term in crypto though.

3864 2018-01-11 19:06:14 Even after I quit smoking I used to have dreams where I was smoking. That was my litmus test. It took a year before those dreams went away. Only then did I think I was properly free from nicotine. Smoke all the dope you want, but stay away from the legal nicotine.
3865 2018-01-11 19:06:08 Oh, most important thing since you are confident of #TRX , we have to completely ignore the brutal $hitstorm of hate, FUD, misinformation, fear, envy that will come at us with a vengeance. If you believe, then believe with strength and conviction to your beliefs. HODL!!!
3866 2018-01-11 19:06:07 Being a Bitcoin maximalist will only make you biased against other cryptos. It will blind you from the innovation other projects are making. It will make you irrationally bullish on bitcoin. There are a myriad of reasons why you shouldn’t be a maximalist for any crypto.
3867 2018-01-11 19:06:07 CryptoCurrencies are on sale today! The FUD coming from South Korea is a buying opportunity! #Crypto
3868 2018-01-11 19:06:06 Salt was also a currency long time ago and we all have Salt at home but we changed the Monetary system into gold so we don't pay with Salt any more (well maybe somewhere they still) , welcome to the new Store of Value and currency on the near future stored on Bits and encryption.

3870 2018-01-11 19:05:59 With the process of buying crypto, it'll never be mainstream. I have a decent amount of money and its still a painful and timely process to deposit more if I want to. Unless I decide to go to a BTC ATM in which they rape me in exchange rate and $4.99 in fees.

3874 2018-01-11 19:05:46 Going above your job description. Look I'm not saying I should have gotten a $0.50 raise. But instead of getting $0.00 give a worker a raise Cause Getting hired at @$12.35 they work 5 years at a company to only get to $14.35. + I have 2 degrees in my field.
3875 2018-01-11 19:05:40 Appreciate the call!
3876 2018-01-11 19:05:39 I think that "somethiing" might be triggered by a crypto scare.

3894 2018-01-11 19:03:44 check the crypto price this week, @DeepOnionx has the most lively performance.
3895 2018-01-11 19:03:43 Obviously, given the bubble,  #crypto will go the way of tulips, internet stocks, and mortgages, which are all completely worthless now.
3896 2018-01-11 19:03:41 I've gotten deep into crypto. $XRP is partnering with @MoneyGram to test cryptocurrency-enabled payments.
3897 2018-01-11 19:03:37 Love the Crypto love the community, screw the banks that screw us all.  As we push towards a new world one that's actually for the people and by the people.

3907 2018-01-11 19:03:05 , happy to follow you & read your tweets about crypto. Have a great day :)
3908 2018-01-11 19:02:51 Have you ever seen migrant workers sending money back to Mexico via WU or MoneyGram? Those folks aren't going to be able to use crypto to send money back home.
3909 2018-01-11 19:02:47 But what lvl u think its good to buy in? The project seems nice tho
3910 2018-01-11 19:02:46 It's definitely overpriced being that they don't actually have a product out yet. However if people buy in and hodl the coins it may never be this low again this may be the "bottom" it's all speculative who the fuck knows pawn all your belongings and go all in if you'd like 
3911 2018-01-11 19:02:46 Only a truly free and open market like crypto can help level the playing field.
3912 2018-01-11 19:02:41 Does that still apply to friends that have never traded a day in their life bragging about their crypto gains and how great they are at trading haha? I sort of secretly want them to feel the same pain we’ve all felt in our trading journeys

Man the crypto currency bubble gonna be fuckin amazing, except legitimate businesses jumped on the train last minute so it won’t just be turbo bootstrapers wearing anchors as life preservers.

3928 2018-01-11 19:01:14 Q: Does Jameson know any engineers in the crypto space who are available to work on _____?
A: No; demand far exceeds supply. There's a ton of capital available to hire these engineers, but they don't exist. We must first create more engineers by investing in education.

3962 2018-01-11 18:58:53 $XVG is by far the best crypto, fast transactions, more and more business are accepting it, stealth transactions are working, and MAC OS released yesterday. This is a superior coin that currently is undervalued. #FeelSafeWithVerge @vergecurrency
3963 2018-01-11 18:58:46 Let me clear, no government can stop the rise of #Cryptocurrency. The value of currencies is based on supply & demand (+in the case of crypto limited amount of coins).
They can regulate and threaten to ban it, regardless of what they do #Cyptocurrency is the #newmoney!
3964 2018-01-11 18:58:42 So now JIO is planning to come up with their own Crypto currency ? Does that mean that we don't need to worry about indian govt banning crypto ?
3965 2018-01-11 18:58:41 Everyone who I have spoken to today that holds Crypto has said this to me today 
3966 2018-01-11 18:58:40 Seems to me all that crypto-mining effort would be more productively exerted on modelling cancer cell mutations or making the New York Mets competitive again.

3984 2018-01-11 18:57:28 With the environmental concerns, and potential loss of tax revenues. I imagine it is only a matter of time before governments put their foot down on crypto.
3985 2018-01-11 18:57:22 Bottom line  for all crypto. South Korea has put forth a bill to band all crypto . It may take a few years for the bill to actually go through . The crypto can dive or can strive due to people in a hurry to@get in or out . Who knows!!! #trx
3986 2018-01-11 18:57:15 I guess this is my 2nd reason to be bearish then, I don't believe that the $crypto market should be valued at 700bn, I think that 3/4 of the projects are scams and the 1/4 has to prove that they are even functional to deserve their valuation. This is the definition of speculation
3987 2018-01-11 18:57:03 Extremely

3989 2018-01-11 18:57:02 Watched the segment. He didn’t talk about the benefits of bitcoin. Just the price of electricity he is using. Still don’t see the point of bitcoin. Sure it’s a crypto currency. But for what end?

4006 2018-01-11 18:55:27 I think if I was still sold on crypto, which haven't been for a few years, the only one that accomplishes a tangible goal is $XRP. $BTC & $ETH are still trying to pretend decentralization via zero-trust protocol is possible at scale or necessary.

4030 2018-01-11 18:53:33 Not the right alts I guess. But also, BTC recovered a lot from the low it got during the panic so it could've been worse for you. Relax and look case by case, coin by coin.

4040 2018-01-11 18:53:01 Thanks. Yes, I've had a few crypto traders on the show. If you scroll through recent tweets, you'll see a tweet with links to three episodes.
4041 2018-01-11 18:52:58 What impact will the crypto economy have on employee engagement? Typically it's a huge challenge for an organization (centralized) to motivate and engage their workforce- curious on your thoughts

4048 2018-01-11 18:52:24 You shouldn't invest in Ripple! It will make you some money but it's not good for the real crypto currency's!
4049 2018-01-11 18:52:21 Just buy ETH or LTC and get into the alts. No excuse to not getting rich with crypto
4050 2018-01-11 18:52:18 I dont think there's issues, these guys are just scammers! The data you buy lasts 31 days, they will have issues for 15 days in that 31. The 16 days worth of data you loose it after it expires. Then the circle continues the following month!
4051 2018-01-11 18:52:15 Lol, I'd like to see leftists start a boycott bitcoin movement. Not that they're going to succeed but at least the crypto bubble would burst
4052 2018-01-11 18:52:13 Literally got my seed back this am n cleared 45% profit in additional crypto. Good word.
4053 2018-01-11 18:52:12 @brian_armstrong 
im holding bitcoin on coinbase, wheres the rest of the crypto dividends?theres more forks than just bcash
4054 2018-01-11 18:52:10 Real world use cases are always going to win. Not everyone is an investor. Not everyone is going to buy Bitcoin to make money off of it. Plenty of people shop at Walmart but don't own Walmart stocks. The same applies to the #crypto field.
4055 2018-01-11 18:52:09 Your kidding right? After N Korea fud, bcc and ripple pump I'm down 10-15% on alts.. I'm stuck
4056 2018-01-11 18:51:59 You, sir, rock.
4057 2018-01-11 18:51:57 Linda sounds like a coin straight out of the sex industry. It sounda like a sexrobot made by google.

4059 2018-01-11 18:51:50 I get really nervous with investing in block chain and crypto coins/stocks. It's going to come crashing down eventually just a matter of when. These companies don't really have much profits or a future they just say crypto and their stock rises a lot.
4060 2018-01-11 18:51:41 Yeah that sounds all sweet and dandy,  but how about a bit more relevant detail? A bio perhaps? What is he/she going to focus on first and when? And aren’t Alibaba going to get pissed at you poaching all these people of theirs?
4061 2018-01-11 18:51:28 Lol.. central bankers dumping on fomo buying noobs. Good thing they didn’t list on coinbase or half the new money in crypto would have gotten rekt and shaken out, prolonging adoption.

4078 2018-01-11 18:50:18 i could use some ripples
4079 2018-01-11 18:50:04 Ha, no I’m looking at different ways of making my own money(which crypto has been great for ) so I don’t have to rely on the state. How would be practising self harm?

4090 2018-01-11 18:49:32 That may be good but the price goes up or down because people buy or sell ripples. But despite the good news nobody wants to buy ripples at the moment. Would other crypto have such news it would go up like a rocket.

4103 2018-01-11 18:48:43 I thought market cap was gonna be 2 trill by end of Q1 but crypto looks like its lost some hype. Prob another crash soon unless exchanges get their shit together or the safe white man at Coinbase adds some coins so ppl in app store can play.
4104 2018-01-11 18:48:42 So just to clarify... did you actually have time off to look after your new born or were you working for the duration of your maternity period?

But then again, why the f do I need to tell everyone all that info. It's MY money.
4185 2018-01-11 18:43:18 Yes, Ivan, you're right. I also think Sara is simply obligated now to shoot a separate video and publish cognitive articles on the subject of crypto currency. No other way.

Learn to research and find information online. Research in crypto will get easier.
4194 2018-01-11 18:42:57 The market cap doesn't need to be that high for the coin value to reach lofty heights. Crypto doesn't follow normal investment rules, and Tron will be so big that they make the rules
4195 2018-01-11 18:42:55 Still same issue .  No more progress by.. @B3Coins AND.. no reply from @B3Coins

4197 2018-01-11 18:42:51 Centra has working cards and was not affected by the Wavecrest issue, curious as to why you think $TKN is ahead in any way?
4198 2018-01-11 18:42:43 Why would government want crypto? They don’t need the features it offers, so why would they pay the massive cost it requires, as compared to a centralised solution?

4274 2018-01-11 18:37:19 The first thing I did when I got into crypto was that I went all-in with 2FA, on all exchanges and even on social networking accounts. Didn't lose any sleep because Meltdown and Spectre security flaws.

4341 2018-01-11 18:30:58 Listen. Mainstream media has to be much more responsible with its reporting on #cryptocurrency. They are causing people to get #REKT with their irresponsible titles and timing. 

Don't fall for it. #bitcoin #ripple $BTC $XRP $XVG $DRGN $VEN $WGR $KCS
4342 2018-01-11 18:30:54 Charlie, how do you see this playing out as crypto continues to develop and threaten fiat currencies? Governments will continue to put the squeeze on crypto by restricting fiat money flow into the space. Is there a way around this?
4343 2018-01-11 18:30:51 I feel that u should include analysis of the company's roadmap and achievements into your technical analysis. The initial spike is caused by a youtube video that no charting analysis can predict.

4356 2018-01-11 18:29:44 In crypto, you can subscribe to the technology model or the monetary model; antifragility vs policy. Unclear which model yields fits better, but antifragility is great for papercuts and not so useful against a bullet.

4365 2018-01-11 18:28:58 @SedanoESPN @Locs_n_Laughs The intrigue in crypto isn't the tangible use of the coin but the block-chain technology that could be implemented in society.
4366 2018-01-11 18:28:53 this is crypto trading, while I can't speak for @CryptoCoinNewz I would say it should be scalable as I look at trading as more about percentage gains or loses and less about the dollar value unless only trading against the usd. I would interested in hearing his take on this.

4379 2018-01-11 18:28:06 @LuisvonAhn What do you think about the waste of electricity on crypto mining? Any thoughts on how to reCaptcha that compute?
4380 2018-01-11 18:27:53 You are mad because you have put 100k $ in #Neblio #NEBL and your profit has come down.. so stop being mad and act like a mature  crypto prof. 
4381 2018-01-11 18:27:52 True, but to be fair, there is indeed a bubble. But I wouldnt name it Bitcoin, rather call it crypto bubble. And if it finally pops anytime, a few out of them will stay.

4388 2018-01-11 18:27:20 yeah, it's funny cuz I was looking into btc mining back around $800 -- think I even reg'd at coinbase if that was around
but I didn't do shit + when it went to 1k I figured I missed the boat
now ppl are like
should I get in at 5k?
should I get in at 8k?
should I get in at 13k?
4389 2018-01-11 18:27:18 What's your opinion on XRP being centralized, Ripple holding 60 billion of the 100 billion supply, and the fact that XRPs intended users (banks) won't touch it?

Fees are dynamic, tiered & competitively priced. BTM's will remain the more expensive way to get easy & convenient, near instant access to crypto, but it's also the most expensive avenue (for operators) to bridge the gap down to point of sale public introduction

4403 2018-01-11 18:26:29 Big fan of Tron but there’s power in knowing what you have. It would be beneficial to us all if there was no preannouncement to every announcement. The announcement itself will pack more of a market punch in an already oversaturated speculative rumor mill that we call crypto.
4404 2018-01-11 18:26:29 Announcement out before the weekend? We are all very eager for the development.. Communication is key, many are watching...  I'm confident it will have a materially positive impact on the brand and awareness of $proc
4405 2018-01-11 18:26:27 If you are asking Fiat prices 0.1 was like $350 end of September and is about $1375 right now

4407 2018-01-11 18:26:21 In crypto world, you  pay for every transaction. 
Even from your BTC wallet to your other BTC wallet on the same computer. 
It’s like on the internet : any message is paid twice: me to send it, you to receive it.
It’s hard but it make sense.

4422 2018-01-11 18:24:53 I think that you sound dumb. In fact, BTC worth 53 times more than LTC while you manipulating the price with your twits. If LTC would cost more then BTC, then it would make sense. Don't pretend stupid, because you are not.

4449 2018-01-11 18:22:45 Bitcoin is "gold 2.0" only when the price goes up. When will (inevitably) go down what will be the reason to hold it? Gold, on the other hand, is stored in almost every family in the form of jewelry and valuables, let's stop comparing two fundamentally different things, can we?
4450 2018-01-11 18:22:27 What I'd like to know is how much was 0.1BTC to 0.1BTC now? Or have you already accounted for that?
4451 2018-01-11 18:22:23 I prefer a mid-range ROI on a node anyway - less inflationary pressure for longer-term holders.

4455 2018-01-11 18:22:17 I don't think any crypto will stabilize for quite some time. We'll continue to see major pumps followed by major corrections for a while for BTC, ETH, XRP, XRL, XLM, LTC, & a few others that actually have good utility.

Moneygram for XRP gave it a nice pump though.
4456 2018-01-11 18:22:12 It's almost like the panic from yesterday never happened. Almost.

4466 2018-01-11 18:21:36 Dude, lower your expectations. FUD like this is what causes dumps. Its probably not spacex and if it is we can be pleasantly surprised. We SHOULD be happy that $trx is partnering up with real companies for real usage.  That is reason enough for it to "moon".

4487 2018-01-11 18:20:14 Random American “boy” understands that these companies are trying to benefit off the back of a crypto craze and are leading the unlearned into making investment decisions based on the pomp and circumstance of an overly stated relationship.
4488 2018-01-11 18:20:12 I am a big fan of @transferwise and use them regularly as I live in 3 countries. But more and more I started going to crypto as my reserve, and don't care about borders anymore, having exchanges in different jurisdictions to transfer to local fiat.

4490 2018-01-11 18:19:56 How is the South Korean market going to affect this coin? Since they're cracking down on crypto trading
4491 2018-01-11 18:19:48 2) will do anything to change that. Transact with btc through wallets that support these protocol changes and you will see it works fine. Everything in crypto has a purpose and perhaps btc became too big as a p2p system but it's how we measure everything.

4496 2018-01-11 18:19:38 If you were a Bitcoiner in 2014 you recall all the "BTC integration" announcements, so you know every "crypto partnership announcement" in 2018 is:

- An attempt by a struggling company to remain relevant.
- An attempt to pump the crypto.
- Has no affect on the crypto's demand.
4497 2018-01-11 18:19:36 My dad was talking shit about my crypto holdings and asked, “okay, but if you needed that money right now could you get it.”

4512 2018-01-11 18:18:52 Honestly @justinsuntron your shilling for Tron is getting pathetic. No wonder his post about $TRX was most talked about crypto, 90% of the tweets are from him.. Give it up man, let the project speak.. $btc $crypto #shilling

4517 2018-01-11 18:18:08 Sorry for inconvenience. Guess I learned you can’t send crypto from a plane.

still no update on when you will be back online? this is looking really shady

4520 2018-01-11 18:17:55 One thing people tend to mistake is in thinking that they are paying taxes on the total VALUE of the Crypto they hold, when in reality the tax is only on the DIFFERENCE in value of that Crypto from when they buy it to when they sell it. Also, losses help offset gains.
4521 2018-01-11 18:17:53 Can’t wait for half the jails in America to be filled with crypto guys who didn’t know how to properly pay their taxes

4528 2018-01-11 18:17:23 When reading my tweets related to crypto, do know that I am NOT telling you what you should or shouldn’t buy. I’m sharing my insights, what I think is going to happen. You MUST do your OWN research! Don’t let FUD and FOMO ruin your trading career
4529 2018-01-11 18:17:22 Remember when we all used to think that Wall Street was 'smart money'?
4530 2018-01-11 18:17:19 If you love banks go with XRP .. The most centralized Crypto so far .. Fuck XRP everytime someone bet for ripple we are going backward ... You don't realize they have control over all your investment

4533 2018-01-11 18:17:03 I'm not a crypto hater but your argument that gold & silver won't work as money in the future because nobody owns them is very weak. Far more people in the world own some Gold and/or silver than own any crypto!
4534 2018-01-11 18:17:03 If you love banks go with XRP .. The most centralized Crypto so far .. Fuck XRP everytime someone bet for ripple we are going backward ... You don't realize they have control over all your investment
4535 2018-01-11 18:17:00 Some will be free forever to help people get onboarded trading crypto smartly. Going deeper will be paid education.
4536 2018-01-11 18:16:55 "Our goal is to put a crypto mining in every home" - Hanna Tekle Pindza #ACHIEVERSKLUB
4537 2018-01-11 18:16:54 Well, he is a great man. I listen to him. But he also said: "Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful."
Since his prediction scares some people away, he is just ensuring crypto will have a bright future along with up and down.
Thanks granpa!
4538 2018-01-11 18:16:53 Why is buying crypto so fucking convoluted
4539 2018-01-11 18:16:52 $neo $icx $html $emb $eth $etc HTML and emb are very undervalued, icon is the biggest crypto of Korea and neo is the Chinese ethereum. Ethereum and eth classic just because of the mainstream adoption coming this year
4540 2018-01-11 18:16:48 Coin pump and dumps should be against the law. Terrible for the crypto world.
4541 2018-01-11 18:16:44 because I still worked, I did my job above the standard, When I was MEDICALLY CLEARED to work, I would come in on my days off, stay late if needed. If you deserve the money and showed MGT you are an exceptional worker you should be rewarded.
4542 2018-01-11 18:16:43 @MelissaLeeCNBC Why be so negative and hateful towards crypto. Do u have a special interest?????
4543 2018-01-11 18:16:41 Thinking retroactively like “if I would’ve invested into amazon and crypto currency before they blew up I’d be filthy rich” is gonna depress you
4544 2018-01-11 18:16:37 When I go to my internship I'm not mentioning a word of crypto there. Sick of having people ask me "How do I get a Bitcoin?"
4545 2018-01-11 18:16:36 so one crack and two side pieces? #totalpackage

if that dude has crypto he has too much of it
4546 2018-01-11 18:16:36 Is it fair to assume that we should see our coins to intact ?
4547 2018-01-11 18:16:33 Come on. it is probably a sponsorship for some satellite or so
4548 2018-01-11 18:16:31 yeah, but you know what you're doing
4549 2018-01-11 18:16:28 Holding 20k shares
4550 2018-01-11 18:16:22 Spent all my money on crypto rather than security.
4551 2018-01-11 18:16:22 Yes and no. Governments are made up of people who disagree. Legacy banking and financial technology companies are anti crypto. Emerging FinTech companies are pro crypto. All depends who is bribing who...

4553 2018-01-11 18:16:19 Cool. Thanks!
4554 2018-01-11 18:16:18 Most every other crypto I see when they say they have a partnership they also announce who it is. Take a look at Ripple and Moneygram today. They didn't say..."We'll tell you who in a week" TRX is constantly saying "We'll announce this next week"
4555 2018-01-11 18:16:15 Government having it tax free, of course... Russia seem to know where the future is, except they're gonna push their crypto rubble for the masses
4556 2018-01-11 18:16:01 Scam coin? Do your research kid. And it’s not delisted on coinmarketcap, it got listed yesterday. You are obviously new to crypto
4557 2018-01-11 18:15:59 Ok after adding it and purchasing the SPHTX tokens.  Each time you go back into Eth delta, you need to add again for the tokens to show up.
4558 2018-01-11 18:15:56 How many members?
4559 2018-01-11 18:15:55 Reminder: always try to hold your cryptocurrency asset beyond a year to avoid short-term cap gains tax. If you have to liquidate something, liquidate from the oldest asset onwards. I know a year is an eternity in crypto, but this is where being a hodler gets rewarded.

4562 2018-01-11 18:15:28 Make a list of all the currencies you think are good investments, then make a list of who their customers currently are.  The ones with the most customers and the most business wins.

4564 2018-01-11 18:15:20 considering the underlying trend is up, i'd predict a break up... but it's crypto, you never know #xvg $xvg #VergeCoin
4565 2018-01-11 18:15:17 The uneasy truce will completely go away once we start talking about (non coin) crypto again.
4566 2018-01-11 18:15:15 All this negative news about crypto gettin cracked down on is making my dick hard because it means I'll hit my buy points again lol
4567 2018-01-11 18:15:14 Haven't bought into the whole bitcoin and crypto craze even though I have been majorly tempted, I am however bullish on the blockchain technology and companies integrating this technology into their ops
4568 2018-01-11 18:15:13 Trying them all nothing is working. I’m on a plane for another 3 hours. I will try again when I’m not on the plane Wi-Fi, haha.
4569 2018-01-11 18:15:04 Well that’s why I have NAS .
4570 2018-01-11 18:14:49 Both companies involved call it a partnership.

Random American boy on twitter says it's not a partnership. 

I hardly think random American boy is in a position to talk semantics.

4585 2018-01-11 18:14:03 the pop culture analogy that seems to pop out is crypto key = knowing the location of hidden treasure.
4586 2018-01-11 18:14:03 Yes I had to pay for electricity too, and I do not have enough rigs to mine anywhere near that amount in that amount of time. 80% of it came from trading
4587 2018-01-11 18:14:03 Probably not the best place for #crypto investors right now, along with the tax news...

4593 2018-01-11 18:13:46 The contribution to your IRA will only be deductible if you are eligible to participate in a traditional IRA.  To be eligible, you must have earned income.  So if your income is soley derived from crypto trading your contributions are not tax deductible.

4620 2018-01-11 18:11:46 I see, thanks!
4621 2018-01-11 18:11:39 I got into crypto jus to make enough to cop a steelcase chair.
4622 2018-01-11 18:11:33 Crypto is changing the way we do desktops. This will be obsolete and the new age will transcend the paradigm of desktop org as we know it
4623 2018-01-11 18:11:33 Crispr, Quantum computing, Machine learning, graphene, next gen batteries. Would all get my vote over crypto.
4624 2018-01-11 18:11:33 Damn, what did u invest in?

4627 2018-01-11 18:11:27 After watching 100+ hours youtube videos on crypto-assets things Im expecting to hear from financial advisor during our next meeting: "First of all, this is not a financial advise, please do your own due diligence"
4628 2018-01-11 18:11:26 Yes, liquidity is a concern with low cals

4636 2018-01-11 18:11:02 I don't dismiss that threat. Just arguing crypto's success as threat to QE bullshit & bank profiteering will only materialise if it isn't successful as an investment

4641 2018-01-11 18:10:55 Looks awesome! Apart from all of those outdoorsy things that Whistler is awesome for, I'm curious if there's any tech/crypto community at all out there? I'm expecting a no, but still curious :D
4642 2018-01-11 18:10:51 oh, you included mining on that? so it wasn't like starting with 0.1 $BTC and trading your way to 1 #bitcoin but also including the electrical costs? just curious on that. 
what was the best plays? $BIS / $ELLA and $PIRL?
4643 2018-01-11 18:10:51 $POE $TNB $VEN $TRX for sure... idk about "most" under valued but hoping for  a good run with $Kin as well. #cryptocurrencies #crypto

4648 2018-01-11 18:10:21 Or maybe it's the crypto rumor mill (and algo's that read them and then trade). My crypto-trading and believing son just texted me "that silver is going to be crucial to our next wave of space industry innovation."
4649 2018-01-11 18:10:20 What is your favourite crypto investment type?
4650 2018-01-11 18:10:19 Crypto traders worst enemy is the 15min, 30min graph view. If you are long you really shouldn’t look at such a limited view. Try the one day view and I think you will be much happier.

#altcoin #bitcoin
4667 2018-01-11 18:09:15 That's the price at the moment. It was under 1btc when I looked a week ago and now it's over 1. The ROI isn't as high as some other masternodes but I think the roadmap and team are strong which is what I'm looking for
4668 2018-01-11 18:09:10 Yup
4669 2018-01-11 18:09:07 すみません出先でした。

いま銀座ではコインチェックのアプリを入れている人がかなり増えてきたので、一年後は地方にもすごく普及していそうですよね！
4670 2018-01-11 18:08:57 Swing trading and mining mostly

*I define a "swing trade" as a trade that takes anywhere from 24 hrs to a few weeks.

Day trading for me is only good for big moves (like the BTC dump/recovery last night)
4671 2018-01-11 18:08:54 what about b3 wallet ?

4673 2018-01-11 18:08:52 From a currency standpoint I agree, but allowing it to be traded as a token is great financial opportunity for the crypto community. I have no problem ridding the wave 
4674 2018-01-11 18:08:50 There is the option to use BeeNest with FIAT and other crypto, but having a large amount of the coins held outside the target market seems like a bad business model to me.
4675 2018-01-11 18:08:47 Because donating the money to further Litecoin and crypto-currency is better than burning it.

4677 2018-01-11 18:08:42 My recent obsession has been with crypto currencies. I spend enough time following the market and news cycle to draw some informed thoughts. I might as well share them now that twitter has lifted the LAME and uninviting 140 char limit.
4678 2018-01-11 18:08:39 How about an update on Tron Dogs in the US before space travel? I needz crypto-doggies.
4679 2018-01-11 18:08:39 Whenever Crypto twitter gets quite, I start looking to find out what everyones busy accumulating.
4680 2018-01-11 18:08:32 h8trs gonna h8
4681 2018-01-11 18:08:23 People don’t care about real news. You could tweet trx is the national currency for all of Asia it still wouldn’t pump. Quite frankly it only pumps whenever it wants to for odd, random reasons. That’s crypto 
4682 2018-01-11 18:08:19 It's crazy the calls I get. I really got street niggas trading crypto. 
It's about to be a new #BlackWallStreet
4683 2018-01-11 18:08:14 When we take into consideration what the crypto startup did in 2017 when most we just about idea. Then 2018 will be huge when most of these start-ups will actually have a working  project
4684 2018-01-11 18:08:14 indeed
4685 2018-01-11 18:08:12 What possessed you to upload those pictures?
Are you crazy?
4686 2018-01-11 18:08:10 As of now, this works perfectly for GPU computers given the high costs of cloud GPU instances on AWS/GCP/Azure. Crypto miners make ~$5 per day while the equivalent GPU compute on a cloud provider is ~$50 per day. Nearly a 10x difference - all that's missing is the infrastructure.
4687 2018-01-11 18:08:00 This might be interesting result, if it happens, but... doubtfuly so... at least for now. Unless we enter the whole new world of crypto markets and tech evolution but it's too far away, as of now.
4688 2018-01-11 18:07:55 Bought @ .03 so I'm still winning :)
4689 2018-01-11 18:07:54 "If crypto succeeds, it's not because it empowers better people, it's because it empowers better institutions, better incentive structures, and better ways for people to interact with each other." - @VitalikButerin

4691 2018-01-11 18:07:51 Well done. How much harder (if at all) do you think it is to get 12x starting from 10 or 100 BTC instead of 0.1? I know it looks the same but with lowcaps it would be more difficult to get the right entries/exits b/c of liquidity right?
4692 2018-01-11 18:07:50 Warren Buffet is 87
Charlie Munger is 94
If they are not around in 5 years it is solely due to their age-and drinking Cherry Coke everyday-and nothing to do with Crypto.  If they are still around WEB will still be the most successful investor on earth.

4694 2018-01-11 18:07:44 Is this situation of huge delay of #krakenfx upgrade, causing panic selling #xrp #crypto over and over again? I know prices have dropped already the previous hours, but many will be glad to get rid off, because of #kraken, taking the whole market with them.... incredible!!
4695 2018-01-11 18:07:44 $xrp is a great idea.
4696 2018-01-11 18:07:40 What makes you think $REBL is a great project/a crypto of the future?
4697 2018-01-11 18:07:34 Oh really? Why then BTC not at $10 when it's creator doesn't have a twitter to make humorous posts that make people lose money?
4698 2018-01-11 18:07:27 Digamos que ya no trabajo.. invierto en bitcoin. Y como todo los dias y lo mejor es que no tengo que salir de mi casa. Si se puede. Con paciencia se puede ojo. Soy graduado de ingeniero pero la vida me puso como vigilante de estacionamiento. Y ahora. Crypto inversionistas  
4699 2018-01-11 18:07:27 You can run your own node. Stop being misinformed.

4702 2018-01-11 18:07:14 Crypto doesn't have a company behind it, tho. Open source.
4703 2018-01-11 18:07:11 Tron is aan het dalen met 17 procent, en zie sowieso geen stijgende lijn in z'n grafieken. Op dit moment zijn veel crypto weinig waard. Ik wacht vanavond nog ff af

4709 2018-01-11 18:06:31 I am patient; not bringing my emotion to this.  It’s just I am seeing so many mixed responses that alt currencies being delisted then not being delisted; hearing scam rumors; those not being able to withdraw their crypto currencies.  What a mess!!!

アサプン自虐ネタ連発して赤面！！www
4749 2018-01-11 18:04:48 Noobs post the wrong charts from exchanges that are down whilst continually FUDing a Crypto with a real use case because they “hate the banks” 
4750 2018-01-11 18:04:42 I missed my opportunity to buy BTC at a huge discount. Thanks CoinBase for those delayed deposits.
4751 2018-01-11 18:04:42 For new people: Do not confuse trying hard with trading enough. ‘Trying hard’ mostly for me means filling the right bags, waiting patiently and a lot holding during shakeouts. Taking profits and consolidation/diversification is key too.
4752 2018-01-11 18:04:39 I don’t trade crypto. I’ve been working with financial institutions piloting blockchain use for two years while also attempting to bring to market blockchains focused on supporting digital identity,data security, and privacy especially on the public healthcare space.
4753 2018-01-11 18:04:36 So, we are all embracing block chain and crypto, are we? Well, I arrived at two in-store ATM's today, and both said: "Out of Service". That's going to be you in a cashless society, if you choose to hold contrarian views. No to #cashlessness. BLOCKED OUT! - #SaveOurCash - 
4754 2018-01-11 18:04:34 Space Cash?
4755 2018-01-11 18:04:34 Trying to withdraw eth and they saying it could take up to 4 weeks!
4756 2018-01-11 18:04:31 Je suis bien d'accord mais j'ai l'impression qu'ils n'ont toujours pas compris. Les nouveaux riches de la crypto s'expatrieront à cause de la taxe à 60%+ et au final au lieu de récupérer 30%, l'état ne récupérera rien. Taxer à outrance est contre productif.
4757 2018-01-11 18:04:30 I doubt crypto would get like-kind exchange treatment. You have to pay taxes on coin to coin transactions. Well, you SHOULD to be safe.
4758 2018-01-11 18:04:25 @Haejin_Crypto are you sending out the BTC update soon?

4761 2018-01-11 18:04:23 Yup I'm awful. Don't follow me, I only beat the stock market by x60.

PS. Did you see the price recently guys :D
4769 2018-01-11 18:04:10 Hahaahha
4770 2018-01-11 18:04:06 The current price of #iota is massively undervalued. New wallet, new exchanges and new partnerships will be unveiled soon. #crypto #altcoins
4771 2018-01-11 18:04:00 I'm keeping it simple. I track all my trades on @Coin_Tracking , and plan to report all gains to the IRS and pay the tax. I don't want to have to look over my shoulders every time I want to cash some Crypto out to fiat.

4774 2018-01-11 18:03:54 @BitcoinCryptoMM @tailopez 

Does the 67 steps program cover a bit about crypto? I'm still interested in getting it though.
4775 2018-01-11 18:03:44 So tron is literally going to the moon?
4776 2018-01-11 18:03:39 Add that with the fact it's barely in the top 300 crypto coins and the comparison for this project would be $steem which is currently 37th market cap. This means $IFT is undervalued in the crypto market by 22x.
4777 2018-01-11 18:03:32 @thebeetoken Loved the whitepaper (especially PAR protocol.) Is it however an issue that US/HK/China based individuals can't participate in the Token Sale when they represent a large base of crypto users? Especially as you plan to have Beenest in only US cities until around 2020?

4784 2018-01-11 18:03:14 Cryptocurrencies plunged on news that South Korea is working to ban digital currency exchanges. Bitcoin dropped 12% and the global crypto market lost over $106 billion. Just the begining as predicted

4797 2018-01-11 18:02:16 Lets hope for a more stable uptrend finally after weeks of hard dumping to a horizontal movement against all trends in the crypto market.

A coin, that invented the PoS version many other coins implemented deserves a better mcap position than hanging at 230 because no1 hypes it.

4808 2018-01-11 18:01:39 I actually really don't care about his motivation. If he wants to prolong his career talking to elderly xenophobes in seaside towns and being a crypto fascist media talking head that's fine by me.

....just as long as the rest of us don't have to tolerate Brexit!
4809 2018-01-11 18:01:37 Technical Analysis on Crypto is not valid at all, the market goes up and down with the news that’s it. Analysis can be somehow valid between 2 major announcements.
4810 2018-01-11 18:01:35 Everything takes time to consolidate before the next run up. I played around with it to check out the transfer times and I'm probably going to use it for arbitrage opportunities between #cryptopia, #bittrex, and #livecoin
4811 2018-01-11 18:01:28 Crypto Currency is Really Life Changing Shit bruh.  If you’re in it just to make a quick buck, ok i guess. We all need a hustle or a quick flip every now and then But Really Think about the Long Term Man. Fed fucks can downplay it but Crypto Ain’t going NOWHERE. Embrace Evolution
4812 2018-01-11 18:01:23 I'm 5x up on my ridiculous investment 2 months ago, I'm starting to believe it's definitely possible
4813 2018-01-11 18:01:22 China was the largest player at the time. The markets recovered in no time. The point is crypto is bigger than any one country.
4814 2018-01-11 18:01:18 All the predictions are saying that #xvg will rise significantly within the next 24-48 hours! Let’s see how accurate the predictions really are!

4819 2018-01-11 18:01:02 I still *highly* doubt ANY bank or money transfer financial institution will take the risk of holding crypto (Ripple, or other) coin for ANY length of time. Wld regulators allow in any case?

4825 2018-01-11 18:00:43 Ahhh..i was waiting for this one! Did they announce the pre-sale? Do you know when the public sale of the ICO will be?
4826 2018-01-11 18:00:39 I don’t know exactly what crypto will be in the future but your character shows great selflessness. I will stand by it!
4827 2018-01-11 18:00:39 A real currency is money. What stuff like this goes to show is precisely that crypto-"currencies" aren't really currencies.
4828 2018-01-11 18:00:32 Big banks like $GS and $JPM have recently come out backing #bitcoin after an astronomical rally. It suggests that the #Bitcoin rally might stay on hold for the next few months till big banks start saying $BTC is dead. In the mean time, crypto sphere will continue to grow.

4889 2018-01-11 17:56:40 Crypto currency exchange websites must be making tons of money. I just got charged a $13 fee for moving $50 of bitcoin to another address. Wtf. Will be charged another fee to get it in USD. 

Go buy a bitcoin atm and make money from the fees

4892 2018-01-11 17:56:29 Be nice if they accepted crypto for paying taxes. Kind of shitty if all your money is tied up in crypto and they expect a huge tax payment but you don't want to cash out.
4893 2018-01-11 17:56:28 One of the most interesting aspects about crypto: it’s the first time in years big tech co’s are faced with an innovators dilemma problem
4894 2018-01-11 17:56:26 you guys are real scam... its more than 6 days now i cant withdraw my XDN, always you say is in maitanance while you allow deposite
4895 2018-01-11 17:56:24 Law enforcement agencies want as few barriers as possible between them & the data they want, whether or not there’s another way to get the data. I think that’s the driving force behind the FBI’s anti-crypto campaign. If crypto remains, they have to work harder/find another way.

4897 2018-01-11 17:56:21 When your boss says “hearing a lot about Bit Con” you need to chime in. #ltc #btc #trx #crypto
4898 2018-01-11 17:56:12 yeah same, you plan on selling or holding?
4899 2018-01-11 17:56:08 Lol
4900 2018-01-11 17:55:46 Well then I apologize for the snarkyness. People saying shitcoin or scamcoin over and over drive me nuts
4901 2018-01-11 17:55:44 Not hate, more like annoyance. Verge had so much momentum behind it and it didn't capitalize. So now, even though it has a good project it's lost trust. I know I'm not the only person who feels this way. It's really upsetting that they bungled so bad.
4902 2018-01-11 17:55:41 男子校の部室みたいなってきたｗ
4903 2018-01-11 17:55:35 There's nothing yet, I understood, just an expression of intent. They just said they plan to draft it. I expect it will evolve by then. Anyhow I don't think it will have a long term impact on crypto.
4904 2018-01-11 17:55:26 sure you can send it there too - I was going to add the funds to the twitter verge wallet for verge tipping here. but either is fine.
4905 2018-01-11 17:55:20 Bitcoin is down c 8% today. A lot of my friends & twitter followers & "followees" are crypto investors THREAD
4906 2018-01-11 17:55:00 ビートさん参戦！！w
4907 2018-01-11 17:55:00 @Aztek_btc, you've just received a 100 bits tip from @byourseff! ($0.55)

Please note that received tips are held in escrow for 24h for better security.
4908 2018-01-11 17:54:54 I agree. They said yesterday they added 250k users in an hour. Crazy. The whole world is sitting with their money out to give but the crypto doors are bolted
4909 2018-01-11 17:54:50 Bien por el mundo normie adoptando cosas del mundo crypto. Les queda como ropa heredada de los primos pero es mejor que nada 
4910 2018-01-11 17:54:46 Don't let the FOMO get you! You're years ahead of the people claiming crypto is a bubble with no market value. Right now it's like buying google in 2001 before they even IPO'd!
4911 2018-01-11 17:54:43 Learning a lot from the videos!!!
4912 2018-01-11 17:54:43 Great work!!
4913 2018-01-11 17:54:38 @laurashin Just started listening to Unchained. Awesome! Super helpful and timely. We had an internal crypto 101 for our team over the holidays. Thinking about awarding coins for personal goals quarterly. 
4914 2018-01-11 17:54:37 Learn from the mistakes of others. Mistakes are costly, pay attention and you can avoid many of the headaches you see in the lives of our community. Plan your trade, trade your plan. $link $wax #eth #crypto
4915 2018-01-11 17:54:34 Gold doesn't claim to be a crypto CURRENCY .
4916 2018-01-11 17:54:33 It is a sickness 
4917 2018-01-11 17:54:31 Love the videos!!!!
4918 2018-01-11 17:54:31 Great! Thanks and how about to buy crypto such as #xmy
4919 2018-01-11 17:54:30 started in october with .1 atm holding more than 4.15 btc. Choose your gems and hodl it

4921 2018-01-11 17:54:21 @Haejin_Crypto Go moon!! @AttentionToken what's happening? #criptocurrency #coin @bitfinex
4922 2018-01-11 17:54:18 All of these articles saying "Crypto taxes are going to be really confusing and aren't clear at all" are super helpful and now I know way more than I did before
4923 2018-01-11 17:54:15 If you want to learn about Crypto, Blockchain, etc... be curious and avoid MSM.
4924 2018-01-11 17:54:07 Maybe in theory, but in practice Trump's tax bill is punitive to states that didn't vote for him.  The working class will be taxed at a higher rate, and federal debt service spending will increase, reducing US solvency into the future.  Good for crypto holdings, bad for people.
4925 2018-01-11 17:54:05 Yaaaay, I've been waiting patiently.
4926 2018-01-11 17:53:59 You think $Crypto is in a bubble? You can literally apply for a 10k limit Credit Card on the shitter and get approved before you wipe. Crypto isn't even close to that level of fucked....
4927 2018-01-11 17:53:59 ていうかもう寝よう
4928 2018-01-11 17:53:58 Good luck explaining that argument to millions of happy AirBnb users. Marketplaces are known for being extremely hard to build. Your product needs to be 10x better than your competitor. This idea may appeal to crypto users initially, but past that, very difficult.
4929 2018-01-11 17:53:57 But if the IRS told us how to do it there wouldn’t be enough people to fine extra hard for doing it wrong thus causing grounds for stricter IRS crypto asset regulation
4930 2018-01-11 17:53:51 Lots, the biggest being my plays on $PIRL, $DNR, $ELLA, and $BIS
4931 2018-01-11 17:53:47 Good job leaving Ver out.  We can finally hear rational opinions about crypto. without "Im a millionaire and one of the first investors in bitcoin. Buy my coin bcash" 500 times...
4932 2018-01-11 17:53:46 I agree that he is 100% a scam artist, and 100% this is a case of insider trading, however I don’t know what type of jurisdiction crypto markets fall under.  He probably gets away with it and laughs on his private island with billions
4933 2018-01-11 17:53:44 I really wanted to be excited about Kodak's CES crypto announcement. It hits on my Rochester pride AND my enthusiasm for cryptocurrency. I just think this snake-oil approach is poisoning the well in the long run for public trust and adoption. #ROC #cryptocurrency
4934 2018-01-11 17:53:41 Awesome !!!!
4935 2018-01-11 17:53:36 @BKBrianKelly should we look at Bitcoin as the “Betamax” crypto and Ethereum as the “VHS” crypto?
4936 2018-01-11 17:53:25 Their afraid that they are going obsolete. They cannot stop crypto.
4937 2018-01-11 17:53:20 Yes sir! Bought in the other day really happy with my position!
4938 2018-01-11 17:53:15 I'm glad I don't need to file taxes, but when I do - I hope to God the IRS makes it easier on themselves and the people. The taxman should just be grateful with 10%-15% flat tax of Crypto -> fiat and cut the horseshit with this 15% per trade tax 
4939 2018-01-11 17:53:11 It would definitely be awesome. What was your strategy? Focusing on lowcaps and @Cryptopia_NZ ?
4940 2018-01-11 17:53:10 @BKBrianKelly  when are you going to launch a Crypto ETF. I think I heard you mention it on @CNBCFastMoney
4941 2018-01-11 17:53:06 If you bought TRX/QSP/ADA lastnight when i said you would be set up for success. #TRON #TRX #QSP #Quantstamp #ADA #Cardano #cryptocurrency #Crypto #cryptoexchange #ICO #ICOs #BTC #bitcoinnews
4942 2018-01-11 17:53:03 Sorry sir. I dont think I have enough TA knowledge....I primarily do volume analysis which is different than standard TA. you can see my tweets and see if you can use it. thanks.
4943 2018-01-11 17:53:00 Why the hate? You can have your opinion of course. Thanks for sharing.
4944 2018-01-11 17:52:55 Don't tell people the size of your bag bro!
Trust attacks can happen.
4945 2018-01-11 17:52:54 It’s a good year to be a Crypto Nigga.
4946 2018-01-11 17:52:52 Don't troll him
4947 2018-01-11 17:52:46 #Fibonacci reversion, investor aversion, altcoin immersion.

Rocketing to the #moon, correcting too soon.

Devising a perfect model, 
Deciding to dump or #HODL
#WhitePaper frauds, reddit mods, greenpaper wads

Love, hope, #FUD, hating - it's #Crypto in 2018
4948 2018-01-11 17:52:46 Good work sir.

I started in Crypto in Nov and I've been surprised at how much great info and help there's been to get me a ROI that I never expected. Not up to 1 BTC yet but early days!

Is that 1.24BTC stored as 1.24BTC or as a number of other coins that all add up to 1.24BTC?
4949 2018-01-11 17:52:44 @COBINHOOD what you're doing is admirable but how come all crypto assets are undervalued on your exchange in comparison to other exchanges?
4950 2018-01-11 17:52:43 いちゃいちゃすんなし！ｗ
4951 2018-01-11 17:52:42 wow did $COST go Crypto or #Blockchain too?
4952 2018-01-11 17:52:38 Finally !!!
Can you please ensure that @thenagaico publishes the same news as you, it's weird that you have to follow 2 twitters to get full news of a Crypto were communication is important. If you need a CM,  Dm me !
4953 2018-01-11 17:52:37 Don't stalk lol 
4954 2018-01-11 17:52:33 No, it was just a personal challenge to see if I could do it during the "altcoin winter" (lol) we had. I really should have tracked it on here.
4955 2018-01-11 17:52:32 À quand une crypto BismaCoin ?
4956 2018-01-11 17:52:30 Also, is he or the media conflating bitcoin and crypto. They aren’t the same thing. Bitcoin may or may not succeed, but it’s hard to imagine crypto not succeeding.
4957 2018-01-11 17:52:25 Since October I turned 5 $BTC into 12 $BTC..surprisingly it wasn’t that hard. Some patience and honest research makes it easy. #BTFD #followyourgut
4958 2018-01-11 17:52:23 @cryptomanran 
Bro you are one of the topmost thought leader. You should pick up Bitcoin Private fork which is upcoming with ZCL. Bitcoin Brand + ZkSnarks + GPU mining. This could be the biggest event of crypto in 2018. The community needs ur supprt
@bitcoinprivate @ZclassicCoin
4959 2018-01-11 17:52:21 My point exactly. $etn will do that IF THEY EVER DELIVER. Wish I wouldve dropped some in $drgn as well but remember deciding not to. Hurrrrr
4960 2018-01-11 17:52:19 $mec $zer $inn
4961 2018-01-11 17:52:18 They appointed the first president to the KBA. Crypto isn't going anywhere.
4962 2018-01-11 17:52:18 Then they said that if you keep on writing after everyone has told you it's a bad idea, then you might have a chance. And anyway, nothing is going to stop you since you can't control your compulsion to write anyway. Trading is likely similar.
4963 2018-01-11 17:52:11 Well, tell that to @moneygram. Listen, i invest to make money. I own all kinds of coins, but in our lifetimes banks will never just "go away". No matter what all the "BTC  purists" want to think. So i am good holding this, just as i think BTC will be more then fine. 
4964 2018-01-11 17:52:00 bought $vibe on the dip at 11500 #satoshi I can easily see it 3-5x by end of January.  #cryptocurrency
4965 2018-01-11 17:51:59 The answer is no. No it won't.

5003 2018-01-11 17:49:38 Bitcoin peaked on December 16 and is now -22% over the last month.

On Crypto timescales this is almost a Lost Decade.

5007 2018-01-11 17:49:15 you have very good content on youtube... something about your videos makes me want to watch... anyhow-thanks
5008 2018-01-11 17:48:50 Second question, some reporters and outlets have taken the professional step of publicly disclosing their #crypto holdings to allay fears about conflicts of interest. Do you own #crypto and if so which #cryptos?
5009 2018-01-11 17:48:50 Ryan DM me. If you're new to crypto start slow. I can at least give you some quick tips to watch your money carefully and point you to a few good resources.

5012 2018-01-11 17:48:45 When you first start writing and you meet real writers they all tell you the same thing when you ask for advice. Quit writing. They all said to me that if you need someone to tell you to keep writing you shouldn't be doing it. It's too hard and you will fail.

5022 2018-01-11 17:48:11 I really do love Crypto Kitties. They are doing something really interesting.

(This tweet is NOT satire, it's serious)
5023 2018-01-11 17:48:09 They NEED more business and if that means 'diversifying', then they've found a NEW REVENUE stream... smart written contracts [2D] via crypto smart contracts [NO D/fractal mapping].... thats VERY SMART INDEED 
5024 2018-01-11 17:48:04 y’all kept saying invest in crypto currency but that shit dropped 50% yesterday and I’m livid at my investments
5025 2018-01-11 17:47:58 If you want longevity, just trade crypto. So many things happen in this crazy industry, time seems to go by slower.

5052 2018-01-11 17:46:03 The pumping from Justin makes me just weary and turned off about #Tron.  Just work and let things happen. No need to make a tweet like this because it comes across just like every other pump and dump crypto tweeters. I want the best, but let results organically pump it up please.
5053 2018-01-11 17:45:40 Will be interesting to watch for the rest of the day and the coming weeks and months ...
5054 2018-01-11 17:45:39 Thanks Eric, you’re clutch as always. When I cash out one day I’ll be telling my kids + grand kids about a bad ass named Eric Choe who helped me get gains in the years 2017/2018 during the crypto gold rush

5057 2018-01-11 17:45:30 Oh my... @CNBC 
Why the need to put such misleading headline?
Mr Buffet is actually a great investor that doesn’t get in things he knows nothing about.
What’s going to come to a bad ending is exactly the people that get in without the least minimum knowledge.

5098 2018-01-11 17:42:46 The reason of the market's dump is the South Korea. Some newspapers wrote that the government wants to ban crypto-trading. However, ministry of justice wants to restrict trading rules due to high risks, but ministry of economics stays ON OPPOSITE side.  So lets see how it goes...
5099 2018-01-11 17:42:27 what stocks are you buying? I am looking at crypto stocks like TEUM and RIOT. not sure where to get in but I know Bitcoin will be huge. ppl are too crazy for it not to take off.

5115 2018-01-11 17:41:37 I've been told that you should consider crypto a risky investment and should only put into it what you can afford to lose. However I've also heard that the reason crypto will be so valuable is because unlike money, it is finite

5172 2018-01-11 17:36:35 @AppCoinsProject With all that team behind you, couldn't you do more updates? Many of us put a big portion of trust in #AppCoins because of your team, would be appreciated by all people that trust you and your project, especially in a market as crazy as #Crypto @Aptoide
5173 2018-01-11 17:36:33 Either APPC is the biggest opp right now in crypto with the 40& coin burn or I am a complete idiot. Both are entirely possible. #altcoins #trading
5174 2018-01-11 17:36:33 Blockchain isn’t limited to crypto currencies and is just a small part
5175 2018-01-11 17:36:32 $XLM has better long term potential than $XRP
5176 2018-01-11 17:36:25 #kraken, the crypto-grandma... Deals with Full-Speed-Powercoins and steps in the Game with a Server from the early 90's... pretty shitty, guys #xrpthestandard #etc
5177 2018-01-11 17:36:17 $xrp @Ripple back in the game. #Crypto #Ripple #xrpthestandard #XRP #Moneygram #crytpocurrency
5178 2018-01-11 17:36:08 How can we buy when all of ours money are in crypto ?

5180 2018-01-11 17:35:51 and that's the most dangerous thing to think it's always going on the same way
5181 2018-01-11 17:35:41 At the moment, due to a lack of crypto education, it doesn't seem likely. However, like MPESA adoption, with enough education and buzz, nothing is too farfetched.

5194 2018-01-11 17:34:28 The reason of the market's dump is the South Korea. Some newspapers wrote that the government wants to ban crypto-trading. However, as I know, ministry of justice wants to restrict trading rules due to high risks, but ministry of economics stays ON OPPOSITE side
5195 2018-01-11 17:34:27 I’m a follower of stoic thought —@RyanHoliday’s @dailystoic had the following from Discourses: “Epictetus is reminding you that serenity and stability are results of your choices and judgment, not your environment.” — this sentiment is vital in #crypto today

5201 2018-01-11 17:34:06 That I'm not sure of, but that would be nice.  I haven't seen any documentation stating either way.
5202 2018-01-11 17:33:56 Thw first jump was on news that #xrp would be listed on coinbase. The latest news that laborers will now be able to send money back to Mexico faster is maybe not as important to the people that trade crypto. 
5203 2018-01-11 17:33:49 Any of you guys into crypto?
5204 2018-01-11 17:33:46 Cryptopia temporarily accepts registrations. keep checking back. They allowed new registrations for a bit yesterday. All the exchanges are doing this. While frustrating, it's a good problem overall. Means there are more and more new users and money being poured into crypto
5205 2018-01-11 17:33:44 Je gaat me niet vaak horen vertellen waar ik in zit. Mensen in de crypto nemen advies vaak te hard. Dat ik redelijk in Eth zit is een publiek geheim.
5206 2018-01-11 17:33:22 It just runs in tandem with ripple. This will stop once it is used as a platform for icos, though.

5212 2018-01-11 17:32:53 @coingiant you are arguing with Tron fanboys on a $TRX thread, this is a losing situation. Don’t waste your time bro! Plenty of room in the crypto space for these cretins to exist. Block, unfollow, whatever, move on. We understand your point

5227 2018-01-11 17:31:59 Payments provider seeing its usefulness disappear day by day, and a FinTech Payments solution company yearning for credibility in the crypto market? Tough to say.
5228 2018-01-11 17:31:44 Good project and has a hudge potential!
5229 2018-01-11 17:31:39 Fiat can't buy you friends, but crypto can
5230 2018-01-11 17:31:31 The mining is not centralized. You can check that yourself. The mining pools between BTC and BCH are just about equal proportionally. If wealth distribution is a concern then you must realize that current fees make 55% of BTC addresses unspendable. This centralizes BTC wealth.
5231 2018-01-11 17:31:29 @CaliSaint2  bluff or nah? 
5232 2018-01-11 17:31:28 Big fan of your analysis man. Reasoned, straight forward and clear of drama. Need more of this on crypto twitter.

5239 2018-01-11 17:30:45 This is interesting. Is the creation of wealth simply a transference of wealth from fiat to crypto or are you saying that crypto can and is injecting new wealth into the world?

5260 2018-01-11 17:28:56 Sisi obvio. Lo tiro largo porque la red de cryptopagos pero denominados en fiat alguien puede ser que la haga pronto, pero para llegar a la estabilidad del bitcoin u otra crypto por lo menos faltan 8 años de market cap y mercado de futuros madurado. IMHO si gano invito a ambos.

5278 2018-01-11 17:26:57 For all the people that say they are against it because this guy told me this or that. Do your own research. Times are changing! You use a form of digital currency daily. PayPal, credit cards etc. Fiat currency is the bubble and Crypto is going to pop it.

5290 2018-01-11 17:26:02 Yeah I was going to say if you have any ltc it would be a lot cheaper. Maybe they will bring to coinbase, but as for now that's just rumors
5291 2018-01-11 17:25:52 Wallets will function the same way and SegWit will not affect this.
5292 2018-01-11 17:25:50 That's the PSYCHOLOGICAL support the 10 000 below the panic sell will start.

5307 2018-01-11 17:25:18 Everything has the value that the Users agree to give it. Bitcoin Is gold 2.0, nothing against other Cryptos as they're contributing the implementation of the Blockchain tech that helps on decentralization and 3º party trust needs.
5308 2018-01-11 17:25:12 Is the logo being facelift also or just the website? By the way awesome app, just need to be faster sometimes with some videos.
5309 2018-01-11 17:25:12 Good lad. Didn’t know you were into crypto bud 
5310 2018-01-11 17:25:01 hey @davidgokhshtein have you looked into @Viberate_com , any opinion on that ? #cryptocurrencies #Crypto #CryptoNews #cryptowiz
5311 2018-01-11 17:24:59 My body is ready
5312 2018-01-11 17:24:55 I THINK CRYPTO IS A PLATFORM WHERE A SCIENCE STUDENT AND A COMMERCE STUDENT BOTH CAN SHARE THERE VIEWS 
SCIENCE STUDENT BY GIVING THE EXPLANATION ABOUT THE BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY WHERE AS A COMMERCE STUDENT BY THE DEMAND AND SUPPLY CONCEPT...!!!
ISN’T IT ?

5327 2018-01-11 17:23:48 The real test is what will you be watching more over the next two days, crypto charts or shot tracker?
5328 2018-01-11 17:23:39 The funniest thing is how quickly many crypto people forgot their decentralisation and anti-banking "morals" when it pumped.  Just shows that most of them don't give a sh** about such things.  They only dislike centralisation and profiteering when it doesn't benefit them.
5329 2018-01-11 17:23:38 Yessir
5330 2018-01-11 17:23:26 Have people looked into Steemit as an alternative revenue stream its a decentralized crypto site. I'm currently waiting for approval the only catch is everything is public along with earnings as long as that isn't an issue check it out!
5331 2018-01-11 17:23:24 He's uneducated about crypto, he even said so.... and of course he wants people to stay in stocks, how else is he going to keep manipulating the market

5348 2018-01-11 17:22:31 Hi Nik, I'm learning to daytrade as in just started researching today. With crypto the markets seem busy all the time what times would you recommend for the start of trade, with the koreans or with the USA? Im based in UK but i think most traders are in asia and USA right?

5351 2018-01-11 17:22:05 I agree. Big problem is, how do we get the average person educated enough to understand how to safeguard crypto? Third party will exist solely for that reason.
5352 2018-01-11 17:22:02 Tutte queste informazioni sbagliate sulla stampa italiana, crypto note nell'ambiente per essere scam pompate a colpi di paginate chiariscono chiaramente la strategia in corso: terrorizzare chi non segue e mettere le mani in tasca a chi è appena entrato e ci capisce ancora poco
5353 2018-01-11 17:22:01 I hate crypto terms like "to the moon" and FUD and HODL. HODL is what THEY want YOU to do so THEY can make money. Do your homework and trade! Don't buy because something goes up and don't sell because it goes down! #XRP

5358 2018-01-11 17:21:46 Last night South Korea Ministry of Justice confirmed that it's continuing to draft its “cryptocurrency trading closure bill”. This bill has actually been underway since mid December.
It’s important to note that the bill would need to pass congress first, that hasn’t happened yet.

5424 2018-01-11 17:16:40 I know absolutely nothing about crypto. I just know market can’t sustain both increases capacity & new openings. Most new are small
5425 2018-01-11 17:16:40 Not sure your source.  Coinbase alone reported passing 10 million user accounts, and that was from about a year ago.  The number of all of crypto assets is probably an order of magnitude higher.

#Bitcoin
5426 2018-01-11 17:16:39 2)I personally I think #crypto wins in the long run. But I'm glad, I'm in before the overregulation.
5427 2018-01-11 17:16:37 I think that ripple will do well, but it being worth more than 5 times what gold is today is a bit of an unrealistic pipe dream.
5428 2018-01-11 17:16:33 some things never get old... crypto needs to get a bit more mature...

5432 2018-01-11 17:16:16 Sure, but if you are on trading view you could also use the alerts notification incase you want faster communication.
5433 2018-01-11 17:16:12 Would love to eventually be able to use USD to buy crypto instead of using coinbase, but other than that the actual exchange is amazing!

5443 2018-01-11 17:15:32 Anything in crypto that allows you to deposit money and earn a return like @bitconnect @usitech or even @GenesisMining @hashflare or even #staking and #masternodes all run increased risk of government regulation.

5454 2018-01-11 17:14:42 @INS_Ecosystem has strong proffesional team and many manufactures join to #INS #INS_Ecosystem
5455 2018-01-11 17:14:38 Yeah the potential price of the coin in the *future* increases because the supply becomes capped, but coins are not removed from circulation, and the price will not automatically go up once the coin burn happens. Coin burns drive price up because of hype, that's about it.
5456 2018-01-11 17:14:23 also what happened Gartman's buy the utilities crypto play
5457 2018-01-11 17:14:16 so thats like saying I have to buy even more SONM on this dip
5458 2018-01-11 17:14:13 Cash in that crypto. We’re going on Vulfpeck tour, loser.
5459 2018-01-11 17:14:11 But milions of them + wholesalers. #trx #tron tron trx to the 
5460 2018-01-11 17:14:08 not really its xRapid 99% uses $XRP for a very very small tranaction fee (useless tx fee because how would a centralized fake crypto currency need spam protection fee? I guess to create a useless token) you know this you shilling con.
5461 2018-01-11 17:14:06 XVG would be just fine!
5462 2018-01-11 17:14:02 With professional hands on deck @Viberate_com .there's no where else you want to be to link music and blockchain technology #crypto #viberate #altcoins #entertainment #music
5463 2018-01-11 17:14:01 - New exhange listings
- AMD Miner
- New multi-platform Lightning based wallet incl. stealth + atomic swaps
- Let’s also not forget that Vertcoin has one of the greatest communities in crypto
5464 2018-01-11 17:14:00 Might be time for a seperate twitter feed for crypto and this one for stocks, its too messy now.
5465 2018-01-11 17:14:00 People are missing the point of crypto. Crypto is ment for you to stop being a slave to the banks if your in debt to the banks you still are their slave.
5466 2018-01-11 17:13:59 Freak
5467 2018-01-11 17:13:48 After showing some early signs of picking up #XRP curve has a downward trend again- I won't be buying anymore but not selling either #crypto

Still gonna run this up the flagpole tho...

5472 2018-01-11 17:13:26 Hopefully we will see on bigger exchange soon
5473 2018-01-11 17:13:20 #INS, #INS_Ecosystem joining the company with extensive experience is an indicator @INS_Ecosystem
5474 2018-01-11 17:13:17 Is this like a new form of SEARS crypto currency or like Monopoly money
5475 2018-01-11 17:13:03 Yes I’ve entered and will not be trading bund. Just FX and possibly some commodities and equity indices. Definitely no crypto.
5476 2018-01-11 17:13:02 can we get an update when it hits that support line? thanks
5477 2018-01-11 17:12:59 I hope at least this one you'll get it right 
5478 2018-01-11 17:12:51 XRP is not crypto.
5479 2018-01-11 17:12:46 Still accumulating $DCR, $AST, and $IFT.

I love my long hodls, (they normally pay off the best)
5480 2018-01-11 17:12:44 Lol centralized company they can do whatever they want - Are you really that dumb, the whole point of crypto #Bitcoin #Litecoin is decentralized don't have to put faith in the corps or banksters and #BTC #LTC censorship proof.
5481 2018-01-11 17:12:40 The difference is $crypto has the power to cannibalize the resources they use to “control” BTC... long ways out still, but the value of the USD will continue to plummet vs BTC. Attempts to “control” $BTC / $crypto will be a lost battle in the long run.
5482 2018-01-11 17:12:36 What. A. Douche.

5487 2018-01-11 17:12:15 -
5488 2018-01-11 17:12:12 Wonder what % of new crypto "investors" in the past 3 months have any clue what you just said.
5489 2018-01-11 17:12:11 Yeah, I know... I said "except speculation", everything that you mentioning is speculation.
5490 2018-01-11 17:12:02 Tengo una gemita oculta con muy buena pinta, desvelaré el nombre cuando vaya bien cargao
5491 2018-01-11 17:11:59 Yeah you're right...but few people with a fuckton of bch, bought before the whole propaganda circus, and centralized mining, are centralization. IF bcash succeeds your little bcash asses are stuck to the will of few people=FED-style baby  good luck with that.
5492 2018-01-11 17:11:52 Middle name*
5493 2018-01-11 17:11:44 Thanks man!
5494 2018-01-11 17:11:42 What is everyone's thoughts on BitcoinRuby?
They are running a special now, 20% bonus.
If you use my code, Ruby44528, you get an additional 100% bonus on your purchase.
Anyone have any info on this crypto they could share?
5495 2018-01-11 17:11:39 Yes, but considering market cap stays the same or bigger, price will go up. And no, team does not buy them back. Probably it will be made by adding a little price into trasaction fee and sending coins into unusable account and will be marked as removed or something like that.
5496 2018-01-11 17:11:38 In the future every single one of us will have our own brand of crypto currency. Entire towns will rise up around new power plants to fuel the transactions. Smartphones will be forced to quadruple in power merely to run the app that handles the exchange rates.
5497 2018-01-11 17:11:29 Never take a lose. Hold until you are even or 2x-10x your money. You might hold a coin for months to break even if you bought at a high and it suffered after. So it's important to never tie all your funds into one currency. #crypto #ARN #NEBL #AST #Substratum
5498 2018-01-11 17:11:17 In fact crypto Christian!
5499 2018-01-11 17:11:15 Sorry Nicks_Crypto, something went wrong.  (FvlFl)
5500 2018-01-11 17:11:06 Just like democratic systems were taken over by cartels and mafia corporates, crypto will be taken over by corporates soon...
5501 2018-01-11 17:11:01 if @evanspiegel and the @Snapchat team somehow intergrate sendin cryptocurrencies through their App, i believe it will be a game changer for them and the crypto community... i will luv to be part of that project~

5502 2018-01-11 17:11:00 @Crypto_Bengal @Crypto_Bengal it got the best of me yesterday.. doh. Very annoying.
5503 2018-01-11 17:10:57 You know that stuff is a double edged sword. I rather say that between jan-march we may see up to .25. Which is still awesome. Anything is possible in crypto, July/Aug is crunch time when the ASIC minors are delivered, After that we will see what real potential this has.
5504 2018-01-11 17:10:52 Look guys #cobinhood is the coin to go with, has enormous potential due to the fact that it is backed buy a reputable new exchange. Trades at around $1 now if it follows the path the binance took then we should see it rise 1000%. Did I get to say that it's a ZERO FEE EXCHANGE!!!
5505 2018-01-11 17:10:49 Demand supply dynamics havent even begun to mature. This market comprises a minority of investors yet. Many of the projects in the industry are designed to promote inflation and hence the reservation of tokens by a project. #altcoins #crypto

5511 2018-01-11 17:10:30 Yes, crypto currency. And I guess the whole stock market lol.
5512 2018-01-11 17:10:15 So I got into crypto... let's see where this takes me
5513 2018-01-11 17:10:09 8th Nov, Year 2025

Prime minister Amit Shah in an unprecedented TV address to the Nation ban crypto trading wef midnight. 1000s of people rush to the Bitcoin ATMs. Long queues. Total chaos. Only Jan dhan koinex accounts allowed with limits on holding. 
5514 2018-01-11 17:10:09 Soon we may be saying crypto cards... s/o @monaco_card

5517 2018-01-11 17:09:51 My guess is that you stand a better chance of becoming a millionaire if you avoid gambling on crypto currency.......
5518 2018-01-11 17:09:49 Finally moving from @BlockfolioApp to @get_delta this should be fun
5519 2018-01-11 17:09:48 What happens in the stock market in a week happens in crypto in an hour, and crypto never sleeps.
5520 2018-01-11 17:09:48 Thanks!
5521 2018-01-11 17:09:46 Yeah any amount is generous and would be awesome to win and help kickstart my crypto trading
5522 2018-01-11 17:09:41 Reason for the downswing was S. Korea mentioned not accepting crypto currencies, however this could not be further from the truth.  S. Korea even though located next to N Korea and Lil Kim the dictator of the worst kind, S. Korea is one of the most free countries in the world!

5538 2018-01-11 17:08:20 Then u cn expect govt will regulate crypto currency.... Lolzxx
5539 2018-01-11 17:08:20 Thanks a lot pak. Semoga bapak diberikan kesehatan selalu agar dpt share tips trik pada kami yg masih newbie di dunia crypto.

5540 2018-01-11 17:08:19 LOL
5541 2018-01-11 17:08:17 Cobinhood is just another exchange like bittrex, binance, etc. It's not trying to be super simple like coinbase. Coinbase is not a trading platform. Gdax is though and this pretty much functions just like that. I think their UX could use some tweaks but not an overhaul.
5542 2018-01-11 17:08:14 @CoinExchangeio Not delisting LIFE was disrepectful for the community and the project. 
@CoinExchangeio Not respecting the result of the vote for LIFE deslisting you started youself is against your users chose, how sad for an exchange. All #leaveCoinExchangeIo

5545 2018-01-11 17:07:52 Why is that you guys do not upgrade the markets for @NEMofficial. It is being traded on so many exchanges yet those exchanges are not being account for and it’s in the top 10 crypto currency yet it’s volume is relatively low when compared to its peers.
5546 2018-01-11 17:07:37 You should have a look at @AgrelloOfficial, Legally Binding Smart Contracts, Powered by AI. They’re going to expand in Asia this year... I let you do your maths. $DLT
5547 2018-01-11 17:07:35 When I say Gold, Silver is included. I like silver more than gold because it will have explosive rise vis-a-vis Gold.

5552 2018-01-11 17:07:00 You still daytrade with upt to 5 BTC? Cause that sounds a hell of a lot more than it did a year ago :) In USD of course...
5553 2018-01-11 17:07:00 It’s for the sheep though

5556 2018-01-11 17:06:50 Dogecoin is not a safe investment at all
5557 2018-01-11 17:06:48 Announce Bitcoin Clashic $BCL and I’ll give you 10 $BCL. Offer only applies to those with 25k followers with Crypto interest. You must own the private keys and it must not presently hold $BCH as $BCL network is partially tied to the hip without replay protection.
5558 2018-01-11 17:06:48 Maybe that’s the problem . I would think if you sold something at market cost it would go through right away and not sit there.

5567 2018-01-11 17:06:15 Be careful who you listen to about investing in Crypto. I guarantee, nobody you know or read a few articles from is an expert. They may have made some money, so far, but they are only riding a tide and that alone does not make them an expert. Educate yourself first.
5568 2018-01-11 17:06:15 В мессенджере WhatsApp обнаружили опасную уязвимость: На конференции Real World Crypto в Швейцарии специалисты из Рурского университета…
5569 2018-01-11 17:06:12 I don't think these are large pullbacks, but expected pullbacks. Crypto moves in big numbers every day. For example Bitcoin dumped 60% and stayed there for three months before making a historic run to 20k gaining $1,000 a day. Nothing new to see here.
5570 2018-01-11 17:06:09 pogs were the original crypto

5585 2018-01-11 17:05:26 At this point I don’t want to sell any of my modest crypto currency portfolio by buying stuff. I’m convinced there is so much potential upside that I am holding every coin I own and adding a bit on the dips.
5586 2018-01-11 17:05:23 Simple Token
5587 2018-01-11 17:05:21 Which one?
5588 2018-01-11 17:05:19 take a look at MG share price
5589 2018-01-11 17:05:16 It's not centralized and got lot of potential in future, still the current cryptocurrency bubble will bust by this year end, only few crypto currency counters will survive, same way like it happend to dotcom sector in 2000.
5590 2018-01-11 17:05:13 This is old news and ppl shouldn't fear. Crypto started as a way to protect the ppl from gov and gov regulation is supposed to scare ppl ?
5591 2018-01-11 17:05:05 @CriptoCube 

Waht up cube,had a Binance account for a while. IYO does Binance have a better platform? Im planning on putting another 10k or so into crypto. What are the gainers on binance? or what to look for. Any info would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for taking my question.
5592 2018-01-11 17:04:55 شكرا اخي عمر
5593 2018-01-11 17:04:46 what bubble pops first - breweries or crypto?
5594 2018-01-11 17:04:45 i felt the same way when i heard everyone talking about BTC Futures... Never thought of it being good for BTC, however the same applies for any crypto currencies...Expect the same for Bcash, ETH etc....
5595 2018-01-11 17:04:43 The article did mention that they were “scrambling” to add low fee alternatives to BTC...
5596 2018-01-11 17:04:39 BTC has high fees and can take days or weeks to confirm transactions which makes it useless as cash. 

BCH is virtually free, supports instant (0-conf) transactions and is built to scale. 

The scam coin is clear.
5597 2018-01-11 17:04:35 The crypto world is in trouble.  Ripple partnered with Money Gram, it jumped up for a few minutes, but now it's back down.  :-/
5598 2018-01-11 17:04:30 @BGriveaux serait-il possible de connaître la raison pour laquelle vous avez supprimé votre tweet concernant la flat tax et son application possible aux revenus des crypto-monnaies ? Merci d'avance pour votre réponse.

5602 2018-01-11 17:04:19 #360trader for the win!!
New to Crypto's and you are showing us all it can be done. Lekke man!! Hi from RSA.
5603 2018-01-11 17:04:16 would love it if you could start a hashtag so that we can collaborate together on crypto ideas and plays
5604 2018-01-11 17:04:14 Checking out #ICOMagnus. Looks promising!
5605 2018-01-11 17:04:12 MoneyGram partners with Ripple. But bitcoin continues to slide. I'll discuss the latest in crypto with @richardquest on @cnni at 12:10 ET.

5607 2018-01-11 17:04:00 No brakes on the VEN train. Stays green it seems no matter what.
5608 2018-01-11 17:03:50 i love how last summer i was telling my friends about crypto currency and they all ignored what i was saying. Then in the fall, they made it seem like they knew what to do and where to invest and lost big money. Today they tell me "I should've listen to you". Sorry not sorry. :D
5609 2018-01-11 17:03:36 every youtube ad is about crypto currencies lol
5610 2018-01-11 17:03:34 The problem with crypto currencies is not the premise... it's that no one is actually using it for transactions. If it's only speculation then of course it's going to blow up
5611 2018-01-11 17:03:24 @CryptoChoe Crypto choe is the man
5612 2018-01-11 17:03:18 ther was a 70BTC sell wall
5613 2018-01-11 17:03:10 Sidenote; I work for one of the biggest media companies in the world. I have huge respect for journalists, because they report real time accurate information. Not unsubstantiated, outdated hyperbolized FUD. I think its sick to defend her!
5614 2018-01-11 17:03:00 If your not into crypto currencies right now your missing out on the biggest wealth transfer in history. After this dip the next boom is coming just like last Jan!
5615 2018-01-11 17:03:00 crypto really is the future
5616 2018-01-11 17:02:54 100 JPY(BTC): 1125.627 ~ 1135.661 KRW(BTC)
5617 2018-01-11 17:02:53 ..I mean in THIS count price could rise after the ABCDE correction which would be around 14k. Not much different to what it is now.

5622 2018-01-11 17:02:15 How to slowly kill a stream.

 Talk about crypto currency
5623 2018-01-11 17:02:12 You should keep your portfolio on a hardwallet such as a Ledger Nano S. Do not keep crypto on an exchange unless you are trading regularly. Sooner or later one of the big exchanges will be hacked and you run the risk of losing your crypto if you leave it on an exchange.

5639 2018-01-11 17:01:11 Omg ripples a scam! Oh wait you have no evidence your so worried about banks joining not thinking we need banks for are crypto system to get running, if they are happy with the small amount of technology they get to use for faster transactions let them doesn't centralize anything

5645 2018-01-11 17:00:28 Bigger blocks do NOT lead to centralization. High fees have been the single largest centralization pressure that Bitcoin has ever experienced. Small-time miners who get tiny payouts every 10 minutes are all now forced to mine Bitcoin Cash.

5663 2018-01-11 16:59:24 No its just really new and people dont understand it. Just like you do your dfs research people need to research the crypto they invest in. In in 2009 a bitcoin had no value and was very easy to obtain. Today its worth at least 10k per coin.
5664 2018-01-11 16:59:22 I'm well positioned in Gold stocks but believe the future is crypto backed by gold so should be positive for both.

5681 2018-01-11 16:57:54 Cryptocurrency is not insured by FDIC or any other organization in the world. We want people to be careful, we're hearing more and more talk about investing in crypto yet nobody is saying how to invest it, how to store it or which exchanges to use (none of which are governed).
5682 2018-01-11 16:57:48 How long is ID Verification taking? Its been over a week.
5683 2018-01-11 16:57:46 That is a really bad idea. You should think about rebalancing your portfolio whenever you are heavily weighed in one or two investments. (Although I don’t consider any crypto an actual investment.  Pure speculation in my opinion). Yes I own several currencies.
5684 2018-01-11 16:57:45 @rahulsood @UnikrnCo what's bigger then conducting a gaming competition in India ? Introduce $UKG gaming crypto to this market :)

5718 2018-01-11 16:54:43 Youre a bit late. This was already proven to be FUD from rueters. S Korea not banning trading. So your post should have been "Fake news from reurters creates FUD and DIP in price" not "SK plans to ban Crypto trading"
5719 2018-01-11 16:54:36 You have to embrace it and prepare yourself for the changes. Educate yourself and ensure you're able to understand the risks. I think crypto is a bubble and will fade out, would be interesting if ever regulated though. Financial market would forever change.
5720 2018-01-11 16:54:27 I will be starting an investment group chat where we will be able to discuss any type of investments that may be hot on the market right now. From crypto to real estate. If interested just like or mention me. Let’s help everybody EAT!

5734 2018-01-11 16:53:18 Hi Haejin, great analysis! Is the trajectory going to change after the recent dips and low volume this coin has been seeing?
5735 2018-01-11 16:53:08 The more people FUD #ripple the higher it's price seems to go. Remarkable!
5736 2018-01-11 16:53:07 By market price, do you mean a limit order at the current market price? If so, I'm having that problem too. Looks like not enough liquidity, so if there isn't enough supply to fill order at that market price, the rest of the order will just sit there waiting for someone to budge
5737 2018-01-11 16:52:58 @mc_frontalot whenever I'm reading about securing crypto currencies with 18 word phrases, encrypted key pairs, printed out hashes and qr codes, I think about Secrets From The Future and feel like it's all for naught

5740 2018-01-11 16:52:40 Crypto 24/7 ole son.  Bitcoin/eth/litecoin futures on Betfair style ladder trading soon.   No more BPL misadventures 
5741 2018-01-11 16:52:37 Come on the name says it all, it might be crypto but logos, names, still apply. If Nike has of been called Martin do you think Michael Jordan would want a piece of the company. Intelliegence is needed in business, sadly no-one can provide that.
5742 2018-01-11 16:52:30 Too many people are looking at the 0.0000001 coins which they plan to bounce to $1.00 overnight ! Please look at the established coins with a use. I promise you will thank me for it. Do some research! $eos $kmd $btc $eth $bat $powr $maid #crypto

5750 2018-01-11 16:51:35 This is about Blockchain technology sir, not crypto.
5751 2018-01-11 16:51:33 #HODL forever is stupid, but selling because of a down turn is equally bad. Altcoin markets are highly volatile, so dips are expected. Don't buy at the top and sell at the bottom. #exitplan
5752 2018-01-11 16:51:31 Yes, in fact, the holidays did not quite positively affect the world of crypto currency. Therefore, it's good that the developers have found a wonderful way out of this situation. Forward, TokenGo!
5753 2018-01-11 16:51:26 If you sold all your crypto because of misinformation through media shame on you you have no balls. #crypto

5758 2018-01-11 16:51:20 XRP may surprise again watch it or ride again . Crypto market can show some recovery with the news that South Korea has not decided yet on banning the Crypto exchanges!
5759 2018-01-11 16:51:16 Yeah..this one the crypto that will rock hard on 2018!!
5760 2018-01-11 16:51:08 Depends entirely, i just started mining last night for a company that rents out the hashing power as apposed to me mining bitcoin and they pay in bitcoin, making more that way, this is tempory i just want $15 to buy into a different crypto rather than wait 5 days for a bitcoin(1)

5763 2018-01-11 16:51:01 Thanks for the digibyte update.
5764 2018-01-11 16:51:00 Just be selective what you read. Many publishers / media outlets are hiring #crypto writers to make noise and ramp up traffic to their news site. Most of these newly employed writers don't understand crypto or the tech behind it. Cheap hits.
5765 2018-01-11 16:50:48 Shut up

5767 2018-01-11 16:50:41 It's been all about new money coming in. As soon as Binance, Bittrex and others open back up, all things crypto season will be back in full stride. Exchange issues are discouraging some noobs tho.
5768 2018-01-11 16:50:36 Works fine for me.
5769 2018-01-11 16:50:25 I followed the tutorial on adding the coin to myetherwallet from the sophiatx blog, and it worked on etherdelta.  Select other and use the address and decimals as stated on the blog.

5778 2018-01-11 16:49:34 I love the self-proclaimed crypto gurus on Youtube giving their regular run down of the top cryptos. It's as if they are presenters of the Top 20 music charts or something! #crypto #cryptocurrency #bitcoin #altcoins #DayTrading

5785 2018-01-11 16:49:10 you mean that if the value goes down to 14k there may be a correction up to $ 8,900. it is?
5786 2018-01-11 16:49:06 could you do an xvg analysis because the breakout you talked about was false that was the fifth wave actually
5787 2018-01-11 16:49:05 Why you dont tweet every post from steemit?
5788 2018-01-11 16:48:54 And Burst is mined with hard drives. so unlike bitcoin everyone can get in on it not just the few rich in china. its truly decentralized unlike bitcoin and ETH

5801 2018-01-11 16:48:10 Told my mom I was investing in crypto-currency and she said she hopes I win. Was gonna explain to her that you don’t actually win money but figured it wasn’t worth my time. Just said thanks.
5802 2018-01-11 16:48:10 The project seems to bring great novelties and utilities to the crypto world #ASTORGAME #ICO #ETH #ESPORTS #BETTINGS
5803 2018-01-11 16:48:03 Send to me ;) Actually, XLM is a decent crypto to be holding right now. It has a lot of potential to increase in value. If you want to exchange for ETH though, that's probably one of the best bets for long term value in my opinion.
5804 2018-01-11 16:48:02 I need you rippley.. show me some love..

5805 2018-01-11 16:47:53 That's true but if they publicly fire McAfee that will be a huge marketing. First of all they will realize that he was advisor. Then they will think. İf they are firing McAfee this project must be really self-confident. İt will call all the positive attention on the project.
5806 2018-01-11 16:47:49 Dogecoin hasn't dropped 8%. That's because it's stable. That's because it's good.

 It's one of the last half-dozen odd CRYPTO-DOLLARS left that's not a blatant "SCAM" bought and paid for by 'Big Wall Street'.

5826 2018-01-11 16:46:19 your quoting principles while actively working against the one crypto that has actually benefitted those in the poorest countrys hypocritical much
5827 2018-01-11 16:46:13 @brucegreene Just watched your crypto podcast. Heard about your Coinbase fees. I wanted to point you to GDAX, owned by Coinbase. They have $0 fee transactions. Adding funds is also $0 fee if you add it as USD before buying your crypto.
5828 2018-01-11 16:46:11 Ok,vous avez un bon rendement,soit !Mais vous décalque votre abonnement électrique sur vos bénéfices !il faut le dire...
5829 2018-01-11 16:46:10 too hard to say from now, but I'll have a better idea after more of the crypto news comes out $CHIT
5830 2018-01-11 16:46:04 If Gackt thinks crypto currency is the way of the future I suppose anyone can now
5831 2018-01-11 16:45:58 #Platinum $PL_F @ 989.00 +10.20 +1.04%... would like to see #Gold $GC_F follow a bit higher here especially as the U.S. Dollar continues capitulating... Treasuries & VIX don’t protect the same. Maybe some of the crazies will realize #Crypto isn’t a real storage of value too...
5832 2018-01-11 16:45:54 Yes, wrong. Insider trading applies to employees or investors who are privy to non-public information. Exterior activities like this, from 3rd parties, do not amount to the real crime of "insider trading," and I think it's sick to be accusing a journalist of this without evidence
5833 2018-01-11 16:45:50 18.2 Billion dollars were raised through crowdfunding in 2016. Now we have a crypto platform that will serve this booming phenomena #sigilplatform #sigil#sigilcrypto
5834 2018-01-11 16:45:44 It's a good project though, but they might do it again right?
5835 2018-01-11 16:45:38 I am launching a new crypto currency called khotasikka. Anyone interested? #Crypto #jiocoin #bitcoin #cryptocurrency
5836 2018-01-11 16:45:26 We’re spinning up a cyber security group shortly... any interest?
5837 2018-01-11 16:45:07 Otherwise, there would still be only one Bitcoin and not multiple "crypto dividends". That's just another spin on #Governance failure. Value should not be siphoned from the main asset, only value added TO the main asset.

they are re-branding their website in January 20th, community is very strong, they have a working product (wich is great if you download the app), only 180M cap.

5849 2018-01-11 16:43:36 When you realize the value of #crypto is not in fiat, but in adoption->my anxiety about crypto inv and $ is almost gone, and I’m more motivated to learn and spread the word than chasing gains. If we want to live in a decentralized world in our lifetime, we’ve got work to do!

5861 2018-01-11 16:42:46 [1/2] Do you think Wall Street bonuses will effect the Crypto economy this week? The total amount of capital from them probably won’t but they do act as a catalyst itself as a whole. A causal sequence of hype and emotion could follow. Also, think about the timing of them...
5862 2018-01-11 16:42:41 I'd donate 20% of all profits I made in crypto if some experienced trader who knows what they're doing would mentor me and show me how to make calls!
5863 2018-01-11 16:42:41 thanks for sharing 
5864 2018-01-11 16:42:40 Nope he is right it's still in a down trend
5865 2018-01-11 16:42:39 I agree it's a mess, largely due to the regulatory burdens. Our group is incubating a potential federal credit union that will specialize in crypto and be able to provide services to members on a fair equal access platform. "Bridge institutions" are needed for foreseeable future.

5880 2018-01-11 16:41:31 @Nigel_Farage talking about a second referendum. I don't care for a referendum, I don't care for Brexit. How about we put more focus, into how we will fund and manage the NHS. There's no point leaving the EU, if by the time we've left, our Country has gone to shit.

5904 2018-01-11 16:39:27 Other question. Can said rig be used to mine for any crypto currency, or is it specific to a certain one?
5905 2018-01-11 16:39:24 It’s his domain. :-) Unfortunately we don’t cover crypto as such.
5906 2018-01-11 16:39:21 90% of people commentating on crypto right now don't understand  it.

5920 2018-01-11 16:38:43 Sponsorship & patronage are kind of the same, but actually different. Both are pledges to support creators, yet bidders & viewers have independent motivation sets.

5938 2018-01-11 16:37:24 Yes I think too crypto volatility will be a huge problem... or $HMQ must have to keep their investors, reward them to hold and not to trade (let's be honnest, 99% of people don't give a fuck about the project but the rentability)

5943 2018-01-11 16:37:08 You are focusing too much on Crypto recently
5944 2018-01-11 16:36:59 Hey @jacobawohl your email addresses no longer work. I would like to ask you crypto questions. I always wanted to ask you managed futures strategy questions, but you oddly didn't accept that. I have always been fair with you. Let's talk.
5945 2018-01-11 16:36:55 @jimcramer bringing in @WarrenBuffett to defend his bleak outlook on crypto, is similar to 90s @paulkrugman brining in (drumroll....) @WarrenBuffett to defend his "internet is fax machine" outlook

5959 2018-01-11 16:35:50 yeah, though not cause they are doing something wrong. It's almost with all the coins at the moment due to this FUD with bitcoin dropping and fake news about South Korea banning cryptocurrency trading
5960 2018-01-11 16:35:47 Questions asked at our crypto vending machine now consistently include "what's your favorite coin under a penny?".  A readjustment is going to take out many of our customers.
5961 2018-01-11 16:35:46 Is it correlated to energy demand for crypto mining?

5974 2018-01-11 16:35:03 To be fair crypto is a new form of investing. He said himself he knows nothing about it.  So as comedic it may be to call him an old hack it’s also just as comedic to take advice from him.

6023 2018-01-11 16:31:20 Totally agree. Paper gains are useless. Honestly Crypto currencies and metal are the only way for people to escape the debt system.
6024 2018-01-11 16:31:19 Ageism is alive and well.  Why is it ok to judge   And insult people for their age? And who really knows much about crypto currency?
6025 2018-01-11 16:31:19 Good time to accumulate more #lisk at these levels. Upcoming core release and relaunch event will shoot this great project straight up. This is a great chance for everyone who missed the train you should have got onto months ago

6026 2018-01-11 16:31:10 This is a new decentralised social media which aims to reward users, in terms of their own crypto currency SAT, for thr activity on social media which ultimately helps brands. They value 20 SAT =~ $1 now, which may rise like other coins; nw they r giving away 50 tokens on sign-up
6027 2018-01-11 16:31:05 This is a normal market dip which happens from time to time. The market will recover, there's still more and more money going in to crypto every day.

1. Don't panic
2. Don't panic sell
3. if you can afford it, research your favourite coins and buy your favourites at a discount

could be tin foil cap, but *shrug*
6077 2018-01-11 16:27:52 @sahelirc You should be fired for writing fake crypto articles. Ever thought about writing something of value? Or are you just trying to get clicks?
6078 2018-01-11 16:27:50 ICO address please sir? Moon soon?
6079 2018-01-11 16:27:42 My comment was agnostic. I'm saying you are suggesting that value doesn't matter, that it's about the end result. If you are buying crypto, you are betting on it being undervalued. One can be optimistic about cryptos' prospects but bearish on the value.
6080 2018-01-11 16:27:42 My point is that animal plants alone are not sufficient for survival. You're proving my point.

6086 2018-01-11 16:27:17 I think it’s the worst whitepaper. Coins like this is what’s going to crash this crypto market and hurt even legit cryptos.
6087 2018-01-11 16:27:16 Crypto’s huge fluctuation are in large part due to a nasty day trading habit of speculation, gambling and irrational exuberance... but there are real game changing technology as the foundation of the valuations

6095 2018-01-11 16:26:48 If it was to gatehub, they appear to be processing things at a crawl. #gatehub seems to be having a lot of trouble with crypto transactions.

6103 2018-01-11 16:26:06 Again, that goes back to payment processors and financial instutions that intend to hold XRP being able to purchase the token at a market discount so they an absorb price variations. And again, as the price increases over time the percentage of change will be dramatically smaller

6118 2018-01-11 16:25:08 Sort of - but TMs can't stop meme's like "bcash/blockstreamcore" taking hold, and certainly doesn't prevent anyone whose been here a while from knowing what's up. It's just makes the bitcoin discovery process for normies all the more hazardous. Which tbh is most of the fun.
6119 2018-01-11 16:24:57 FYI (I am sure you know that): $IOTA is the only crypto which gets positive news coverage in Germany for a while. It is likely that when German mainstream arrives (soon™), they will defo buy IOTA.

6143 2018-01-11 16:22:14 Also, that variation isn't as big a deal to payment processors as they are sure to be holding XRP they purchased from Ripple at a market discount to absorb such variations. And as the price increases the variations will mean less percentage wise.

6159 2018-01-11 16:20:49 Because we don’t like how it’s bank backed. The purpose of crypto is to get away from the need for banks. I see it as simply being a replacement for the current SWIFT system.

6184 2018-01-11 16:19:26 The funny thing is this regulatory action is just the start.  The US banks will launch crypto currencies with the support of regulators.  Any currency not monitored by a firm subject to anti-money laundering rules will be shut in the US.

6196 2018-01-11 16:18:54 South Korea just banned crypto trading, slashing bitcoins price by a staggering 14 percent. Sell now and seek alternatives such as Etherium and Litecoin, this is just the start of banks and governments fighting back against crypto.
6197 2018-01-11 16:18:53 That's not really a good look. Thinking your life is so much more purposeful than others because they have traditional jobs. You're gonna die and nobody is gonna give a shit about the infinitesimal spec in the universe that was you, regardless if you make 10 mill in crypto or not
6198 2018-01-11 16:18:49 Crypto is a risk. Especially when dealing in alts. I feel not enough people come into the crypto Market educated enough to understand the reality of volatility

6239 2018-01-11 16:16:45 Banning crypto currency in South Korea would be a good thing...
Did the alcohol problem go away with prohibition in 1930s, did the drugs disappear when we crimilised them... Just the talk about banning it, is enough to increase the demand.

6262 2018-01-11 16:14:31 Until people understand the technology, they won't understand the true value of crypto-currencies. They will instead only see it as another commodity, and associate its value against the USD. This defeats the original intent of BTC, which was to avoid using the USD altogether.

6329 2018-01-11 16:09:56 The idea would be keep mining, reinvesting the proceeds to build bigger and bigger rigs, until you have enough to crack some crypto. If a lot of the big rigs were located in a totalitarian country, you could just nationalize them whenever you liked.

6356 2018-01-11 16:08:06 (1) Transfers using the XRP token are done in less than 14 seconds. This means the payment processor can go from fiat to xrp, transfer, and from xrp to fiat in about a 30 second timeframe. This results in a minimal variation in the purchase and sell price of the token.

6384 2018-01-11 16:06:17 Trx a scam? Actually it was one of the top most successful launches of crypto for all of 2017. Its up almost 1000X its value from a few months ago. The scam is people buying at 2K gains after only a few months and expecting the same gains and then call it a scam when it peel back
6385 2018-01-11 16:06:16 And hopefully people aren’t borrowing all the money they are putting into crypto.

6433 2018-01-11 16:03:00 Yep to be clear, $XRP is a premined digital asset which we don’t need on crypto market! You can use it between you and your clients!! For us is like a digital usd and you and maybe fin institutions will have the control over it, so basically a shitcoin!

6436 2018-01-11 16:02:53 Désespérément car on attend cette UI depuis pas mal de temps, après y a l'engine prévu fin Q1 avec les FIAT, on hold malgré le FUD sur le telegram et avec la team qui a du mal à tenir les délais mais après je comprend la difficulté de tout gérer avec le sous effectif (ça recrute)
6437 2018-01-11 16:02:36 仮想通貨少女、全員に資産の運用成績を公表させて競争させたら面白いと思う。
6438 2018-01-11 16:02:36 100 JPY(BTC): 1104.399 ~ 1104.914 KRW(BTC)

6440 2018-01-11 16:02:25 Not gonna lie, my $INN masternode has been one of my better crypto purchases 
6441 2018-01-11 16:02:19 @numivcoin 
I deposit btc in my account but why this exchange is not working?
I´m unable to buy any coin.
6442 2018-01-11 16:02:05 Great piece from @crypto_bobby on buying at the peak.  Hype is fun, but fomo can bite you.  If a crypto is up 4X on the day, you’re probably too late and need to hold off.  Don’t let fomo drain you. Also-learn the currency before you buy esp. at an #ATH $trx $xvg $xrp #Hodl #Fomo
6443 2018-01-11 16:02:02 Let me know when you want to transfer them to me;)
6444 2018-01-11 16:01:58 As more payment processors, and financial institutions come into the fold and start moving money with XRP the token will inevitably increase in value. Did you see the MoneyGram announcement?
6445 2018-01-11 16:01:58 Bitcoin on LN is fully redeemable. Trustless LN nodes propagating Bitcoin txn fast+cheap. 
Altcoins are the real "bankers". Are you able to redeem your Bitcoin when you put them into an altcoin system? What did they give you in return? Fiat-tokens and loyalty points!
6446 2018-01-11 16:01:42 Idk your entry but this is a solid one
6447 2018-01-11 16:01:39 Korea is the new China. Just hodl :)
6448 2018-01-11 16:01:39 便利に使わせていただいてます。ありがとうございます。
アプリ内でBNB(binance coin)の取引所がyobitになっているのですが、yobitで取り扱われているBNBはbinance coinとは別のコインです。両者は価格も大きく異なります。
お忙しいとは思いますが、確認をお願いします。
6449 2018-01-11 16:01:34 Yeah 0.07 $BTC is a big chunk
6450 2018-01-11 16:01:28 You have to factor in that if you want to send $XCP from their wallet you pay in $BTC so you need to send btc to the wallet and pay for that transaction too, so all in I paid $80 to get my coins back to the exchange yesterday
6451 2018-01-11 16:01:25 リップル300円超えたいね
6452 2018-01-11 16:01:23 So if 80% of coins drop 95% in value in the next 2 years, but crypto still ultimately transforms currency markets, investors will consider that a success?
6453 2018-01-11 16:01:15 Everyone know $XRP isn't decentralized crypto like $ETH right? Lol It doesn't occur to anyone that $XRP price can be manipulated by the developers? Last I checked, it defeats the purpose of the crypto revolution.
6454 2018-01-11 16:01:09 I'm not sure how to make all these anarchist incentives align to crack a single crypto.  Bounties?
6455 2018-01-11 16:01:07 The immaturity in crypto sucks man. Ppl relax. Apply patience here. Wtf...
6456 2018-01-11 16:01:05 When evaluating the fundamentals of a coin I’m looking at several things, one of which is the tech. 

Ask yourself if the project actually requires #blockchain technology or if the team is squeezing in a trendy buzzword.

6457 2018-01-11 16:01:02 Indeed it would very unfortunate if there were to be as they put a bubble burst! Fingers crossed that the God's of crypto are on our side amidst these announcements coming through... it makes me wonder if the markets would survive without the Asian countries? Your thoughts?
6458 2018-01-11 16:01:01 Having spent years living in the developing world I’m actually more concerned with allowing the unbanked to thrive. BTC can’t do that and BCH can.
6459 2018-01-11 16:00:47 Ed, now that the FUD is over, do you think its the time for $waves?

6484 2018-01-11 15:59:20 The problem with $XCP is that you pay for transactions out of the wallet in BTC, so if you have it in your wallet, it cost me $80 in total to send my coins back to the exchange, but I 3x my trade so I wasn’t too fussed, but that’s not gonns hold up in the long term fundamentally

6529 2018-01-11 15:56:37 In years past when publicly traded companies made announcements about a crypto asset, the asset's exchange rates would pump. These days such announcements pump the company's stock price. Oh, how far we've come...
6530 2018-01-11 15:56:34 I will say combination of all of those tbh. In crypto, I think in general people invest in a coin when it's hot and there's money to be made.

6558 2018-01-11 15:54:52 Caro, this is normal cycles trading goes through.  You have to make sure you are with the right company and leave it to ride. It never fails.  This whole crypto market is just getting attention.
6559 2018-01-11 15:54:51 Everything going on with crypto-currency is just one step closer to living in a Bladerunner/cyberpunk world. And I'm okay with that.
6560 2018-01-11 15:54:50 Also I sold the rest of my btc high but my concern is about its future and not its past.
6561 2018-01-11 15:54:40 Not a shame to me... time to buy, buy...Not a shame at all....
6562 2018-01-11 15:54:39 This, a bit of a dollar loss but barely any sats. Seeing big down wicks followed by modest green candles as btc continues to drop is very reassuring.

6573 2018-01-11 15:53:55 You’re obviously not very bright.. this is just the beginning for crypto.. no reason the marketcap as a whole can’t quadruple or more in the coming years.. that said BTC isn’t the best it was the 1st hence its number 1 for now. So in the coming years why can’t XRP go 3x BTC?
6574 2018-01-11 15:53:46 Can you people work on the new website first than every other thing. It makes more sense to me at this time. @justinvendetta
6575 2018-01-11 15:53:39 Crypto bird what do you think of the New crypto coin that just came on Binance? $APPC
6576 2018-01-11 15:53:32 That's what I would call a #coincidence. You'll see. The world of #crypto can recover even WITH #coinmarketcap changing the rules of calculating prices.
6577 2018-01-11 15:53:25 With @Ripple landing a big company like @MoneyGram I can see this opening the door to other big companies partnering with crypto currency! This is big for the #crypto community #Cyrptocurrency
6578 2018-01-11 15:53:23 @PeterSweden7 is accepting crypto currencies for payment...check his site for addresses for Bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin....I SUPPORT PETER..
6579 2018-01-11 15:53:18 Like the basics and step by step? Usually some reddit forums on those. I also am a crypto broker/consultant
6580 2018-01-11 15:53:17 Not everyone uses Coinbase and with the purchase not be taxable and new exchanges without U.S. reporting requirements popping up, like Schadel-brecher said, those of us that are in the crypto realm do not keep things on exchanges and DEFINITELY DON’T keep anything on Coinbase.
6581 2018-01-11 15:53:15 Over crypto gesproken. Misschien binnenkort een artikel van mijn zijde waarom ik twijfel compleet uit de crypto te gaan. Misschien.
6582 2018-01-11 15:53:11 The marketing is fine. People who don't know anything about crypto and just learnedthe word bitcoin yesterday know what tron is.
6583 2018-01-11 15:53:11 Don't leave out xvg please @CryptoChoe
6584 2018-01-11 15:53:10 Like your thinking more and more :)

これからもよろしくお願いします＼＼\\٩( 'ω' )و //／／
6594 2018-01-11 15:52:36 I never short. I will not play cryptos. However, I will try to make some in public companies associated with crypto space.
6595 2018-01-11 15:52:36 Or the girls from the woman. I am a strong handed woman in crypto. No worries here.
6596 2018-01-11 15:52:31 News of dips in crypto this morning and I’m just watching all my delivery notifications for packages that may or may not be mining related like . #minordip #holdtheline
6597 2018-01-11 15:52:30 -37 C today and +2 C on Tuesday crazy fluctuations that here are normal :) kind of like crypto. My top pick for 2018 is $neo
6598 2018-01-11 15:52:27 It's going to be their separate LTC basemarket site once it goes live.
6599 2018-01-11 15:52:15 Is that $7 a trade true for crypto futures? I thought the public brokers were charging much more for these trades
6600 2018-01-11 15:52:14 Yeah do you have a Mac or windows?

6602 2018-01-11 15:52:00 The problem with this market is that a Joe blow puts money into this under the impression that he will make a million and has no clue how an actual market works.

In crypto the volitilty is amplified x10 times of the stock market.
It's not for the faint of heart.
6603 2018-01-11 15:51:52 I'm unsure to be honest. I haven't done quite enough research yet, although I understand many crypto SCAMS have unfortunately flourished there (ie., Onecoin, crypto 888, U-Token,etc). Some U-Fun Ponzi scammers were sentenced to 20-50yrs. Would be good to show Thailand REAL crypto
6604 2018-01-11 15:51:51 But like you said, if you believe in crypto or are good at trading, far better to just buy coins.  This is just fun and possibly a nice profit.
6605 2018-01-11 15:51:49 #HODL!! You either believe #Crypto is the future or you don't.  If not, sell low and get out of the way.  The future is #BTC #LTC #ETH #TRX #ADA #POE  etc. and it belongs to the HODLers.
6606 2018-01-11 15:51:48 Smh the biggest problem with crypto’s is these guys think they’re all high and mighty in the crypto world so they try and scare other people off, just don’t listen to them, cryptos are open for everybody in the damn world to study and become a part of.  #cryptosarethefuture
6607 2018-01-11 15:51:47 Can u share your price analysis for Ripple today...
6608 2018-01-11 15:51:46 Thank you! @Bitcoin2140com #Crypto
6609 2018-01-11 15:51:46 But govts will eventually fall into line - with no option but to support the cash cow of the bitcon/crypto market with regulations to assure their own profit (taxes)

6619 2018-01-11 15:50:43 If I wanted to crack a lot of crypto, I'd buy a lot of hardware that searches for hash collisions at massive scale.

That's expensive to design and build, so I'd build a market for hardware that searches for hash collisions at massive scale. That would commoditize the hardware.

6623 2018-01-11 15:50:29 雑所得内でしか損益通算は出来ないが。全体の総合課税範囲(雑所得利益含む)から減価償却等のコストを引くことは出来る。

築古だと減価償却が大きく取れる。最後に土地が売れそうなところは狙い目。23区の1等地だと5%の利回りになるかもね。

6625 2018-01-11 15:50:15 When researching crypto ask yourself a question. Do you want to believe cnbc, Forbes, and major financial outlets? Or do you want to believe the Twitter person with a Lambo for a profile pic? Ripple IS the future. Don't take my word for it.

Bitcoin is not a currency. It’s a movement. It’s so much bigger than ‘money’ It’s a rejection of sovereignty.

6659 2018-01-11 15:47:37 His views are rooted in fundamentals. I find that applying the concepts of value-based investing to crypto is appealing and in some way happens today when people consider the white paper, team, code, approach, etc.

6699 2018-01-11 15:44:33 Does it bother anyone else that crypto traders call charts “graphs”? Just another tell that they have no experience trading other than the last couple months of crypto spikes. A lot of people are gonna get burnt in these markets.

6706 2018-01-11 15:44:20 Fiat means by decree.  Value of fiat money is given by state and not by market mechanism. Price of crypto is determined by market and not by the qovt. So its not a fiat.

6711 2018-01-11 15:44:10 Not sure, is it anything different from XHamster? Other than the viewer AND content producer get paid? All crypto has 'folk devil' status but these people are industry professionals, they will be aware of regulations and be compliant.

6715 2018-01-11 15:44:00 I do wonder how much of the venture capital infatuation with crypto/bitcoin is due to Fred Wilson. 

His reputation is such that if he thinks something is a good idea, others follow.

6729 2018-01-11 15:42:33 "doubled" was under-statement. More accurate is more than doubled. At one point of time (before this current alts dip) I had almost 4 times more BTC than my BTC bottom (in alts). Thanks.

6735 2018-01-11 15:42:10 All this excitement around #Crypto is getting crazy. The problem is that when institutions start trading huge volumes at a speedy pace, regulators start looking into it. Which is completely AGAINST the #bitcoin and other #crypto spirit.

自分1月から仮想通貨参入で、最近cryptofolio使い始めたのですが、総資産と資産の＋－で誤差が発生しているため、cryptofolioで差異があるのかもしれません。

他の方にも聞いたところ、たまにバクが発生することがあるとのことです。。
6742 2018-01-11 15:41:38 @jaltucher Wish I could afford your crypto service. Hopefully you consider a free pick or a monthly scrip so I can afford for years to come!

6772 2018-01-11 15:39:40 In the 80's rock scene, if you perm'd your hair and grabbed a guitar, you'd get a record contract.

Now, change:
"80's rock scene" -> #crypto
"perm'd..." -> whitepaper
"record contract" -> successful ICO
6773 2018-01-11 15:39:37 Also I'd be very curious to datamine the "endless crypto horror that is my inbox" and look for statistically significant correlation w/BTC futures. (Unless that's insider trading.)
6774 2018-01-11 15:39:33 Upgrade your website! Crashed and glitched out during XRP run today. Not very showing of a major crypto exchange! My $2000 profit thrown right in the garbage. Thanks
6775 2018-01-11 15:39:31 Boo hoo Ryan you should just be supportive of crypto instead of crying 

You are part of FUD nation.

6793 2018-01-11 15:38:40 Can some media outlet figure out and report accurate news if there is or is not a trading ban. So many conflicting stories. It's sad.
6794 2018-01-11 15:38:39 Very Nice! #XRP 
6795 2018-01-11 15:38:34 yes, and in a way that is surprisingly low-risk... you don't need to put in a lot to achieve this. spreading bets among multiple early stage projects in a bullish market pays off.
6796 2018-01-11 15:38:33 Aha!  also check out my last tweet. Mike may also be some you're interested in

6799 2018-01-11 15:38:24 Exactly - perhaps the blockchain-like plumbing is actually more valuable in the long term than the crypto’s traded on it?

6817 2018-01-11 15:37:17 No it’s that crypto prices are higher in KRW but you can convert back to usd bc there are laws on how much fiat you can send across borders there. Check Bitthumb prices vs coinbase for ex
6818 2018-01-11 15:37:15 As an #auditor, we will encounter issues with blockchain in the F/S sector first bc PE, Hedges, and BD’s will be holding crypto.

6824 2018-01-11 15:36:57 Ahh, you mean the countries that companies like @MoneyGram and @WesternUnion have been extorting billions of dollars from per year, year after year, for decades. Yes I believe crypto will help this situation, but ripple is not crypto, & partnering w/same corrupt co's won't help.

6828 2018-01-11 15:36:44 I doubt it. A lot of old crypto traders disagree with #xrp and it’s real world use and either done understand that #XRP IS decentralized or they just don’t care... New crypto traders are only looking for a quick buck. I made an investment and not looking to have ANY kind of money

6848 2018-01-11 15:34:48 will moneygram give people a discount when they send money?  #rippls's foiunders left it and create #StellarLumens - which is better than ripple because it is decentralized.

6856 2018-01-11 15:34:19 Is the general #crypto environment growing up  or am I just more selective about what I read? I seem to be seeing a lot less 'Lambo', 'Moon' and crazy stickers in Telegram. What do you think?
6857 2018-01-11 15:34:18 $XRP I cannot troll Ripple anymore. They indeed won the crypto game! Congrats to hodlers. $XVG $BTC $ETH $LTC $ADA $LEND
6858 2018-01-11 15:34:17 DRW is still hiring OTC crypto traders
6859 2018-01-11 15:34:17 Crypto peeps who knew and watched #XRP all last year and didn't put it on the team, are like "I knew them when they were a no one"... Still can't believe they are hitting it big...(includes Big Dawg)
6860 2018-01-11 15:34:15 Most of them are dealing with small banks which have not cracked the whip yet. Till the time RBI comes and says crypto is kosher, bankers won't get behind this.
6861 2018-01-11 15:34:14 To buy 1 #Ethereum, you'd need to trade 4,105.92 BurgerKing chicken nuggets! #crypto #nugcoin #KINGcoin
6862 2018-01-11 15:34:12 I’m trying to figure out why it reacted to the MoneyGram announcement. Most people in crypto won’t touch XRP anymore.
6863 2018-01-11 15:34:08 Ripple becomes second most valuable crypto-coin via @BBCNews
6864 2018-01-11 15:34:04 できます。
6865 2018-01-11 15:34:04 Bought some based on this alone.
6866 2018-01-11 15:34:00 I guess what my argument boils down to is "yes it would be academically interesting for someone to tear apart MTProto2 rigorously, but that's a far higher bar than is needed for crypto people to be correct in warning people away"
6867 2018-01-11 15:33:54 Crypto investors be like “we need more announcements” 1 hour after #Ripple announces #xrp partnership with worlds 2nd largest money xfer company lol #icanteven #xrpthestandard
6868 2018-01-11 15:33:47 You've got to make that decision, I can only present the facts, sorry bud
6869 2018-01-11 15:33:43 I do have balls nd hodling it but fuders are working 24/7 to cripple down crypto market
6870 2018-01-11 15:33:38 5/ Time in the market beats timing the market. Crypto isn't going anywhere. Any dip, see rule #1
6871 2018-01-11 15:33:32 Use a vpn
6872 2018-01-11 15:33:27 Looks good. And it is finally time that someone makes the crypto market mass suitable. I'm sure you can do it
6873 2018-01-11 15:33:22 Alright. Chill
6874 2018-01-11 15:33:19 Crypto has got to be the most paranoid market out there.  

Unless you are a well seasoned trader, do as the wise @VentureCoinist says and just Move slower.
6875 2018-01-11 15:33:17 I can't be the only gamer that hates crypto currencies for pushing up the price of GPUs and making upgrading graphics way more expensive ?
6876 2018-01-11 15:33:15 The crypto market is all green for me today. Woke up with a smile!
How's your day!
6877 2018-01-11 15:33:14 Huh? You really think ICX can get there by the weekend? I'm thinking it may stay stagnant until all of the Korean FUD get's cleared up
6878 2018-01-11 15:32:55 わかります。夢が広がりますね。
6879 2018-01-11 15:32:46 The easiest thing that a  successful trader should do is simply NOTHING yet many failed to do so. Meddling with an open position is the LAST thing you'd wanna do. #trading #forex #crypto $XRP $ETH $LTC $BTC
6880 2018-01-11 15:32:44 btw. I'm a long time XRP holder.
6881 2018-01-11 15:32:37 Waiting at the gate for a flight from LAX to SFO (delayed as usual) and seeing LOTS of crypto trading going on around me
6882 2018-01-11 15:32:36 Are u getting my requests to join the Elite Signal Group Channel???
@Yankess11
6883 2018-01-11 15:32:33 what are you talking about...?
6884 2018-01-11 15:32:32 Venezuela launches its own cryptocurrency. 
Kodak to launch its cryptocurrency. 
Jio thinking of launching one too. 
What is so crypto about this, if everyone has a currency of their own? #NoSecrets

6887 2018-01-11 15:32:25 Pues el mismo lo dice, “de crypto monedas no se nada” jajajaja, por lo tanto su opinión final es irrelevante.
6888 2018-01-11 15:32:21 @PayPal which crypto are you going to partner with? #cryptocurrency
6889 2018-01-11 15:32:18 Why? Because your apart of a crypto club and know all things crypto? Whats your recommendation based off of? Or are you just upset about something? Do you need a safe space? Go play in traffic.
6890 2018-01-11 15:32:18 The question to ask is at what point do countries go to war with non-sovereign cryptos. At some point non-sovereign crypto threatens to replace existing currencies.
6891 2018-01-11 15:32:05 The crypto market is so volatile that false rumors of SK shutting down exchanges almost made certain coins extinct.

6894 2018-01-11 15:31:59 So if you want to play the "millions of users" card, well, they're using plaintext, that's the end of the discussion. No crypto conference is going to accept your submission on breaking that!

* by plaintext I mean "client-server encryption" which is tbh VERY SLOPPY on my part
6895 2018-01-11 15:31:55 That moment when you use Go math/rand (requires to be seeded, otherwise predictable) instead of crypto/rand, but then you test your own code and find it right away.

Remember kids, don't mess it up.

6903 2018-01-11 15:31:18 I turned $600 to $1800 in 3 days trading one crypto. So understand I was skeptical too at first but this crypto game is real. $QLC
6904 2018-01-11 15:31:11 1/ HODL: hold on for dear life, unless truly devastating news hits the market. You knew crypto was volatile when you first entered the space. Do not give people your coins for cheap!

6906 2018-01-11 15:30:47 You should probably give me a follow so you find out when it happens 
6907 2018-01-11 15:30:46 It’s not a crackdown like the MSM is announcing. I wish people would do some research and stop believing everything they hear. Crypto’s are down, good time to buy.
6908 2018-01-11 15:30:41 @krakenfx Thanks a lot for letting us miss opportunities on #XRP . I had money ready to invest when good news was coming in. And then I could not place orders, and now too late. We even cannot sell now what we already had...... I will move away from you anyway, unreliable #crypto
6909 2018-01-11 15:30:38 How crypto prices would look if networks are actively used and not just speculated on? Don't know how you would research / think through it but something I'd be interested in seeing some thought pieces on
6910 2018-01-11 15:30:38 You made a post claiming that $XVG will hit 8$ in 13 days and have XVG tatted on your leg. Obviously you are more than all in with XVG - I sincerely hope it works out for you and that you aren't going to be walking around with a scam logo on your leg the rest of your life.
6911 2018-01-11 15:30:35 Both can be true!

1) deploying crank crypto to millions of people doesn't stop it being crank crypto

2) how many of those millions even use the crypto?

it's off by default. Can't be turned on for group messages. Most Telegram chats are going plaintext.
6912 2018-01-11 15:30:25 Hilarious. Two customers with Ripple (or any crypto) don't need MoneyGram.
6913 2018-01-11 15:30:23 さてXRPどこまで行くか
6914 2018-01-11 15:30:22 It cannot, unfortunately it’s not only 1st Gen Crypto, it’s the premival crypto. 
That alone says a lot, even with lightning, it will struggle. 
In saying that the Tech is still in its infancy, the true number 1 hasn’t even been created yet, it would be in initiation stage though

6926 2018-01-11 15:29:54 At minimum, building web stuff involves a knowledge of subtle interactions involving security (as well as precisely how finicky crypto can be) ;)

I was on the Rails security team for a while and saw this stuff first hand. We were dealing with timing attacks 10 years ago ;)

6928 2018-01-11 15:29:45 I have not.  I will be gearing up more $crypto analysis in coming weeks.  The exciting part is how well #spiralcalendar analysis does with these purely emotional markets. Not just this parabola,. but #spiralcalendar relationships defined the spring/summer '17 $BTC tops as well.

7000 2018-01-11 15:25:47 Ripple #xrp is surging back up above $2 and the market cap is back up over 700 billion! Never a dull moment in crypto currency. Did you buy the dip? #crypto #Ripple #altcoins
7001 2018-01-11 15:25:36 For me it’s a great crypto hedge
7002 2018-01-11 15:25:36 No problem bro, next western union, and many more big companies acknowledging $XRP, while you stuck with that lame idea. Btw, stop this argument. Don’t buy $XRP, we don’t need you anyway.
7003 2018-01-11 15:25:27 @JamillaHeiskane who do you trust for your crypto trading advice?
7004 2018-01-11 15:25:26 How many waves are needed to start getting liquid?

7007 2018-01-11 15:25:20 Thank you! And crypto”currencies” are nothing more than company-issued script that is only honored at the company store (and a severely under-capitalized store at that).
7008 2018-01-11 15:25:18 If the rumor about Korea banning trading can errase 100B from the crypto Mcap is not proof enough that all this is a big speculative bubble... I don't know what it is. #XRP #ETH #BTC #Crypto
7009 2018-01-11 15:25:16 The crypto is tyred to go down, FOMO is coming and every pro know it well!

7010 2018-01-11 15:25:16 man I actually feel like I'm missing outta this Crypto wave.

7012 2018-01-11 15:25:14 People -$xrp- bank/centers -$xrp -people. long process with additional fees  thats not crypto . Cryptos are meant to be p2p.
7013 2018-01-11 15:25:06 If you are not well informed to understand what the bitcoin is then learn. I will not be your teacher. @BITCOlNCASH is bitcoin. BitcoinSegwitLN Core bullshit is not bitcoin. That's a bitcoin hardfork. Just happend before you arrived in crypto.

7018 2018-01-11 15:24:41 Don’t forget that we have two futures expiration events that are historical and never been seen before in crypto. 1/18 and 1/26.

7021 2018-01-11 15:24:29 I actually think we would have continued to go up if it wasn't for the South Korean crypto bill being introduced. You just can't predict those things.
7022 2018-01-11 15:24:25 Also South Korea confirms it will not ban crypto trading ! #xrp ripple #trx #tron
7023 2018-01-11 15:24:23 I love $GRWI gem. It has been mostly ignored coin somehow while all other pot coins rallied. Low supply is the key...when ppl know it will FOMO. Life is good with Crypto.

7026 2018-01-11 15:24:05 Nothing to you maybe. All I have is good coins now. Hard to justify selling any of them to buy another. I think I need a loan.
7027 2018-01-11 15:23:57 Because you're thinking of crypto in terms of fiat. Not as an investment in the project. That way is just gambling in crypto but normal in investment management with other assets
7028 2018-01-11 15:23:54 thank you I'm just following up on the idea of hopping ship hopping hope the next time there is a good change

7035 2018-01-11 15:23:35 Yes.  People need to understand that a win for any leading crypto is essentially a win for all of the others.  Too much infighting.

7042 2018-01-11 15:23:08 Just because someone claims they've made a million USD in crypto in a YouTube video and uses crypto lingo doesn't make them a 17 yo Buffet. I could make a video claiming I have a 17" cock and that's equally likely...the level of disinformation around is insane
7043 2018-01-11 15:23:07 Always buy the dip. #protip #crypto and research, research, research. 

1. Due diligence 
2. Study the founders
3.Does this company solve a problem in my everyday life?
4. Is the founding team keen on delivering?
5. Have they doubled down on customer service?

7045 2018-01-11 15:22:54 I think that in this volatile market $BTC #bitcoin keeps pump and dumping until march 2018. My prediction is that it will rise after that. What do you guys think that BTC will hit at 1 april 2018? $crypto
7046 2018-01-11 15:22:54 hehe..I can see how it happens. I mean crypto doesn’t have the best branding out there…we basically have “bitcoin” and “zero knowledge” .

7051 2018-01-11 15:22:36 @Ripple_XRP_News @KingRippleXRP @vicogico @Ripple 
What news about crypto do you prefer? Why? (add a comment)
7052 2018-01-11 15:22:30 @CryptKhan27 has it mostly right. More money keeps pouring in, but this is the first rodeo for a lot of HODLers and they have no fundamental market skills, just blind faith from crypto-philosophy or looking to score a buck.
7053 2018-01-11 15:22:29 word
7054 2018-01-11 15:22:24 Wow let’s go to the moon with the #XRP rocket 
7055 2018-01-11 15:22:23 A crypto meme with Eric Holder. Do it!
7056 2018-01-11 15:22:22 "crypto" refers to however people use it as an abbreviation, that's how language works, get over it.
7057 2018-01-11 15:22:22 Ripple XRP crypto is exploding
7058 2018-01-11 15:22:18 What’s the plan now that Korea has banned crypto ?

7065 2018-01-11 15:21:54 China is moving to eradicate the country's Bitcoin mining industry over concerns about excessive electricity consumption and financial risk, reflecting authorities' judgment that crypto currencies are not a strategic industry........
7066 2018-01-11 15:21:53 People won’t be investing so much as living off crypto.
7067 2018-01-11 15:21:53 $CMCM another crypto pump. On the move with volume. 17.50 calls active. Upside to 20 on a 17.60 break. Current price 17.30
7068 2018-01-11 15:21:52 Fair enough! But I think a lot of people buy more crypto after they got an exchange account.
7069 2018-01-11 15:21:50 @MichaelSuppo $HTML. Serious project. No competition. Love $HTML
7070 2018-01-11 15:21:48 Bitcoin should just ignore all the FUD and hit 20k, so that these stupid analysts who started investing in 1950's and know nothing about blockchain can be given yet another shut up call. #BTC #Eth #crypto
7071 2018-01-11 15:21:45 Because not everyone has credit cards, bank accts, access to internet, understanding/trust/access to crypto, etc.
7072 2018-01-11 15:21:42 Yes, what about xvg
7073 2018-01-11 15:21:39 Thoughts on pulling out your initial investment(s) from Crypto??
7074 2018-01-11 15:21:35 Yeah, atleast 2500. So tbh next ATH. Sell. I’m HUGE on HODL but i believe the partner may continue and you will be able to increase your stake while pulling profit.
7075 2018-01-11 15:21:34 It’s okay to spend some $ off your crypto money to remind yourself of when you made an earning off a wave you were a part of lol

7080 2018-01-11 15:21:09 No you cannot. Until you cannot transfer own crypto from one exchange to Revolute and discount it, this system does not bring significant advantage.
7081 2018-01-11 15:21:07 Yeah would make me a millionaire so yeah ok bro
7082 2018-01-11 15:21:04 @SomiEkhasomhi 
You're obviously ahead of us all in the crypto research, 
I'm not ready to do the Maths but I'm positive the guys in the /biz/ board are up to something.
Check it out and if you see anything good please let me know.
They've always been a step ahead.
7083 2018-01-11 15:21:02 but not present. I will wait another week if there is no good change I will exit. maybe a huge hole I use 8btc to buy it at 11satoshi
7084 2018-01-11 15:21:01 I am not accusing, just want to understand the process. Do you have a link where they address this?
7085 2018-01-11 15:20:58 So they could halt trading with a date like china in efforts to curb problems whilst forming regulations?
7086 2018-01-11 15:20:54 Xrp is a shame voor crypto!!!

Artic doesn't seem worth the hassle (low ROI). Maybe ChainCoin?

7146 2018-01-11 15:17:19 Any comments about the FUD youve been spreading on xrp now that moneygram is using xrp and its daily use exceeds every other crypto put together?
7147 2018-01-11 15:17:06 "I know it looks like we're being pedantic or even cliquey, but what's really happening is they've spotted a fatal flaw in the crypto."

I don't feel anyone is being cliquey and I interpreted the first round of critiques in exactly this way.

7150 2018-01-11 15:16:44 Why invest in DEX (Decentralized Exchanges) :
> Probably 100% uptime
> Hack-Proof (no platform to hack, it's decentralized)
> trade everything while someone wants to sell/buy 
> the more people use it the more powerfull and unstoppable it'll be
> % earning from fees

7155 2018-01-11 15:16:35 Finance world hates #cryptocurrency as people invest more and more in crypto. They fear to loose more and more $$$. That´s why there are many articles like this one
7156 2018-01-11 15:16:33 #ripple if moneygram ends up using xrp for currency transfers then would that make xrp currency, and if so would the irs be able to tax it? Can they declare one crypto as currency and others as property? #bitcoin #litecoin
7157 2018-01-11 15:16:26 All I believe is that Bitcoin should be for everyone, not just the rich who think $30 fees are trivial. The third world needs Bitcoin (Cash).

7174 2018-01-11 15:15:38 $xrp is a legalized scam as the economical system where you live.XRP is giving back power to banks what crypto was treing to avoid.

7242 2018-01-11 15:10:27 @boxmining Another argument I do not see being publicized is how Buffet, Dimon, and establishment say crypto does not produce anything of value. American Express and VISA et al create value by clearing transactions. BTC is more efficient They are the middle men in danger.

7289 2018-01-11 15:07:27 We are with rebl Community. Really Really a blasting Entry in crypto-world. Rebl is rocking .boooooooooooooom
7290 2018-01-11 15:07:26 Did investment  in 2 legendary tron dogs then I left the rest if it will be  .50$ till Wanchain will be out I will put half in that coin, if not, I will put more money into crypto and hold it. However my portfolio did x3 in 2 days and now dropped to x1.5.
7291 2018-01-11 15:07:21 Bana da bukadar çok sorumluluk yuklemeyin. Zaman bulamıyorum hep. Bugün az kalsın kızım ölüyordu.

7296 2018-01-11 15:07:03 More than 60 trillion dollars just flew in the overall market cap in like 20 minutes after the #XRP annoucement. Crazy...and the market cap is still going up. #crypto #cryptocurrecy #cryptonews #bitcoin #altcoin
7297 2018-01-11 15:07:00 Talking about crypto is about as dangerous as politics on Twitter now. Everyone picks their favourite and fights to the death how all the others are shit in comparison. IMO there’s allot more potential if you keep an open mind and just trade the technicals.

7313 2018-01-11 15:06:11 Wrong choice of the picture. Govt staff in Russia is badly paid, the State is not in its best financial shape. They have also the right to invest in crypto, for a decent life. This is not necessarly related to the corruption. The same for Venezuela. #ThinkMore #PolitiicalIssues

7315 2018-01-11 15:05:57 I dived into crypto only 6 months ago  (8 hours a day since) so I don't know the OG level of every guys around here. Maybe not all OG's but inspirational

7322 2018-01-11 15:05:43 The wealthiest man in the world is heavily invested in crypto. Just think about that. 

There are coins you can buy right now for less that $0.01.
7323 2018-01-11 15:05:42 I finally grasp what is this crypto market. Bunch of pumpers and Fomoers and people thinking this is the future, all these twitter assholes with bit characters not showing who they really are. Most own pump groups in telegram use VPN and shill their shitcoins for months. #bitcoin
7324 2018-01-11 15:05:42 How are you going to execute this? Don't you need to have a license with every state when converting $USD to Crypto?
7325 2018-01-11 15:05:40 @letsmakesomecash it’s crypto. RB doesn’t do that

7329 2018-01-11 15:05:26 I wonder why you talk about $strat much? what do you want?
7330 2018-01-11 15:05:26 Sure, you can trade price action on technicals, including fibonacci levels, MACD, RSI, resistance and support levels across different timeframes. Fact remains, price always catches up with intrinsic value. Always. And Crypto currency has zero intrinsic value.
7331 2018-01-11 15:05:22 My Top Ten Picks for growth for Cryptocurrencies

1) Cordano
2) Ethereuum
3) BitCoin Lightening Network(Futures for now)
4) WABI
5) Verge
6) Litecoin
7) InsurePal (ICO Stage)
8) Stellar Lumens
9) NEO
10)Kin
7332 2018-01-11 15:05:20 How is the Nigerian government positioning itself to tax the crypto market?
It's one to regulate and another to tax.

Partner with local bitcoin wallet/exchange.
Once the investor converts to cash. 
It attracts a tax charge, albeit minimal.
7333 2018-01-11 15:05:18 Good pick mate, shame it's just trading on ED right now. Imagine it hitting a real user friendly exchange :)
7334 2018-01-11 15:05:18 I know I seriously won't sell until it's well over 1 billion cap. The only crypto I can say that about.
7335 2018-01-11 15:05:11 Crypto coins can go darker than they currently are. There are trade-offs which have not been made because most of us presume we live in free lands. If this is shown to be false, darker iterations will come along and can go viral. Crypto will be the new measure of open societies.
7336 2018-01-11 15:05:06 New $PAC will solve the problems that plague other #cryptocurrencies. Fast transactions, low fees, and an inflation plan that does not create wild swings in pricing. This is the #crypto that replaces fiat.

7428 2018-01-11 14:59:37 so sick & tired of ppl buying coins like crazy& chasing candles without reading articles, posts & checking it.#dyor #investtime #crypto
7429 2018-01-11 14:59:34 Wow that’s big news ripple is going crazy from the news over $2.00

7434 2018-01-11 14:59:14 Lmaooooo big crypto papi!
7435 2018-01-11 14:59:13 He also claims his ignorance there. But I would agree that crypto at its current state has turned into something that it wasn’t meant to be.

7439 2018-01-11 14:59:12 @Crypto_goat_ check out the youtube video about Ripple trash talk.  He breaks it down with excellent charts, correlating the news with the ups and downs.  I found it really helpful.  Thanks.
7440 2018-01-11 14:59:11 Not really. A tip from a YouTube viewer? Wow!

7450 2018-01-11 14:58:58 @crypto_ty i watched your youtube video on the Kucoin and KCS dividends. Can you explain this, I haven't seen any income yet? Is there a minimum investment point?

7455 2018-01-11 14:58:42 いえ、ウエスタンユニオン(想定)とあともう一社です。

なので提携発表はあと二回ある
7456 2018-01-11 14:58:40 Has been curious about why crypto was a thing in US. Until I heard a podcast explaining about how long it took you guys to do a transfer.  In Taiwan, if I buy something online, they will send me an email about the transaction within 24 hours. #cryptocurrencies
7457 2018-01-11 14:58:39 Are you happy? 
7458 2018-01-11 14:58:27 Any good news for ripple and crypto twitter goes silent minus those that have it lol. I got out of $xrp for a profit into other areas that have mooned but do wish I had a bit still. #crypto #bitcoin
7459 2018-01-11 14:58:27 great!!!
7460 2018-01-11 14:58:15 XRPの初動に気付いてうまく乗れた　おいしい
7461 2018-01-11 14:58:14 ご購入ありがとうございます。ゆうパックの配達の早さにも感謝です。
7462 2018-01-11 14:58:11 リップラーが半分利確してたりしたのを知る。なんか皆、全然調べてなくて残念だなー。。これだけは覚えておいてほしいです。今月の三井ー韓国のリップルネットワークのテストが終わったら、4月からはXRPを使って実働開始します。たぶん1番インパクトあって1番速い実需です。提携とかじゃなく実働です。

7474 2018-01-11 14:57:39 Clicking on that tweet shows a response from me. Plus, if I was trying to avoid your questions, I wouldn't actively send you a tweet offering to answer questions from you.

As for banning people on TG, we've only banned people who insult and disrespect others.
7475 2018-01-11 14:57:36 Did you know if these numbers above are correct (which they're not) crypto alone would be worth 2x the current global wealth.

7478 2018-01-11 14:57:21 Me thinks - the bottom has dropped out of the so called Crypto Money Game. Some won, and many still hoping.
7479 2018-01-11 14:57:21 I sold my soul and my $friends for crypto. Where can I buy some more sir?
7480 2018-01-11 14:57:20 but most of the $VET will be out of the circulating supply because of the 3 nodes system 10k-50k / 50-150k / 150k+.

7490 2018-01-11 14:56:40 Like I say, duping Blockchains is wrong. Even if BTC has become unusable, it's no excuse. It sets a dangerous precedent and undermines crypto. New coins should start with fresh empty blockchains.

If it does I want to put one two way machine in my store.
7497 2018-01-11 14:56:23 Good project but you see nothing kincoin does not seem to match the project. They are not interested in kincoin. You remember the time before about troncoin but at that time troncoin has about 150 satoshi

7499 2018-01-11 14:56:02 The #Bitcoin dominance metric is trending downward over time because of the sheer number of #Altcoins that now exist in the $Crypto space.

It was interesting to watch as an indicator, and yes, the trend will reverse at some point, but it will probably never return to 60% IMHO.
7500 2018-01-11 14:56:02 The time is now.! Go xrp!
7501 2018-01-11 14:56:00 Pc kapatmazsak psikoloji kalmıyor onu öğrendik. Birde elde btc tutmanın kıymetini öğrendik. Acaba birazda usd tutmak mantıklı olabilir mi?

7510 2018-01-11 14:55:12 There was also a Senate discussion on crypto announced just as BTC hit support. Maybe to try and crash it through. Failed this time. Many don't realize how much or the crypto media Roger Ver owns.
7511 2018-01-11 14:55:07 Now Tenx is really cheap .. thanks because news will come soon. I have bought low :-)  it's juste the beginning for crypto. Xapo and others are also out because of wavecrest
7512 2018-01-11 14:55:05 @XRP jumps around 29% since first of three new partners name released.Coins or tokens with real everyday use will be the crypto winners in the long run

While hype is going to contribute for the next crypto “crash”, ALL major industries have experienced crashes. Oil market, railroads, airlines, and yes dotcom. Crypto will be an industry thus face same evolution.

7524 2018-01-11 14:54:43 It's not very hard to imagine that groups of conspirators used crypto to make money... If a conspiracy is merely a plot, then they are ubiquitous. :D @Bitfinexed at least digs up valid photos and dogs deeper than most, so we know whom to actually trust in this saturated space.

7557 2018-01-11 14:52:17 I think both questions are right, but the question is how far into the future we are looking. To significantly shorten the next crypto bear market and the war against authorities, a good dex would be Godsent.

7560 2018-01-11 14:52:05 Everytime you need cheap coins just ban , next day unban. People it's crypto you can't ever ban it. That's the whole point ????
7561 2018-01-11 14:52:04 Agreed, and there's also a clear distinction between spending lavishly and unconsciously, and treating oneself after accomplishing a hard-earned goal. Generosity and self-fulfilment aren't mutually exclusive.

7572 2018-01-11 14:51:29 Everyone with capital in crypto should understand the risk by now. South Korea announces a ban on crypto currency trading will be on the table for discussion and vote. Well, ETH dipped, but held right around where it should have.
7573 2018-01-11 14:51:28 XRPの昇り龍やばｗｗ
7574 2018-01-11 14:51:25 Ripple is basically the Antichrist of crypto currencies... there’s no way to mine it meaning supply is controlled by someone (banks since they hold the largest amount of coin)... also there is a major “Pump” happening right now that will lead to thousands of people losing money..

7576 2018-01-11 14:51:08 That would be cool, actually. And yeah, I don't think they will fall just like that. But perhaps they may adapt somehow. With the rise of crypto and new tech, social movements.
7577 2018-01-11 14:51:08 In a country of 51M were supposedly 30% of middle class buys crypto, do you know if that had any sort of impact? I agree, there is hope!

7607 2018-01-11 14:49:43 It may be wise to get out of FIAT, in many cases. Just to be sure. Don't store fiat except when you need it for pragmatic reasons and go into crypto, stocks, property etc.

7646 2018-01-11 14:47:41 Perfect! That is what #Cartel is for. Transferring money from people to Banks. The future transfer of wealth is going to EPIC...I mean EPIC. Banks will collect all major coins from people. In fact people will sell it to them low. Welcome to the insane world of Bankers.
7647 2018-01-11 14:47:40 And at the end of the day, a crypto released to the masses in this way has not been done before. Millions of teenage users will suddenly find themselves holding these digital coins which they can exchange for real life things. All I’m saying is anything could happen.

7652 2018-01-11 14:47:31 What
7653 2018-01-11 14:47:24 I’d been wondering what the big secret to crypto currencies were and how they could make something from nothing. But they’re not, they’re monetising energy. Emperor’s new clothes...
7654 2018-01-11 14:47:23 Not doubting the credibility of the news. I'm just assuming their intention for releasing it is the same as always.
7655 2018-01-11 14:47:21 anti-fragile nature of tech innovation is interesting.

failures of centralised crypto exchanges & noise of increased govt regulation spawn speculation and development of decentralised exchanges.

7715 2018-01-11 14:43:54 I love watching crypto investors who got rich on basically a whim turn around and give investment advice to others. It's like lottery winners insisting you really must try rolling down your socks before scratching, it worked for them. -Ben

7734 2018-01-11 14:43:04 Contrarian thought: If decentralized protocols are a computational standard, which requires mass adoption to be defensible, then go-to-market will prove to be a key differentiator in winners vs. losers, not necessarily the best tech. Agree/disagree? #crypto
7735 2018-01-11 14:43:01 Neither. Litecoin. I think this shows your lack of understanding of crypto by having XRP over LTC in your poll.

7815 2018-01-11 14:37:09 We’re lucky here in the U.K. that they’ve classed crypto as a foreign currency which means, thus far anyway, that capital gains only need to be reported when converting back to fiat.

7841 2018-01-11 14:35:34 I hope you’re right. Personally, I think they’ve already criminalised crypto ownership in the US simply by classifying it as a commodity and making it so that all transactions must be accounted for. What chance do people have of getting this absolutely right?

7897 2018-01-11 14:31:33 Buffett is very smart and has a great track record, but he doesn’t buy tech he doesn’t understand. I remember a few years ago he said he would never buy AAPL, but he eventually came around. He might be huge in crypto in a few years.

7958 2018-01-11 14:27:36 Not saying trading successfully is only luck. Saying the crypto market is an anomaly. Having had the right interest to find it and take advantage is. Most people won't have this opportunity. They have to work 18 hours a day for 10+ years to "be interesting" and successful.
7959 2018-01-11 14:27:35 Kudos to @Reuters for crashing crypto market twice in 3 weeks with fake news.
7960 2018-01-11 14:27:32 I think bitcoin tech is troubling, altcoin market is irrational. I think total crypto market will ultimately have at least 2-3 trillion market cap valuation. My value is solely dependant on the 1% using crypto as a spec. wealth hedge which I think they will.

7963 2018-01-11 14:27:29 No worries.

Rapid devaluation from the news cycle will re-motivate most.

Most people can't stomach the relatively benign volatility of the regular stock market.

Crypto swings will shock them.

7987 2018-01-11 14:25:46 2.  So keep some etherium available in ERC20 wallet. ICO's can't  be purchased from crypto exchanges as the wallets on the exchange cannot accept the ICOcoins in return.  As on fundamentals, kodak is photography technology expert. I am not sure about their "licensing" expertise.

7993 2018-01-11 14:25:23 Whenever there is a new ATH on a coin your invested in .  It is in your best interest to pull minimum 5% if not up to 30% ).  Not one single crypto that has reached new All time highs &  kept them for more than 4 days max. Move profits to new investments or buybackin when in reed
7994 2018-01-11 14:25:15 If you cant stomach a is 20% dip then you dont deserve 100x-1000x gains

8006 2018-01-11 14:24:05 Capital is fleeing China via commodities, precious metals and crypto-currencies. Is why the first two are disconnecting from normal relationships. Having said that am very bullish inflation, though expecting a pullback here.
8007 2018-01-11 14:24:03 Two differing agendas, I suspect the public don’t understand that but will more readily accept a central bank digital coin after all the hype from crypto. Hard core crypto believers understand limited supply, everyone else just FOMO on quick buck
8008 2018-01-11 14:23:56 The people instilling fear into crypto are the same people stocking up when the prices are this low because they know when this comes up they will go up with it

8010 2018-01-11 14:23:52 So unhinged, fragile, narcissistic, anti-semetic, ableist, crypto-fascist, careerist dog? Yes, that all sounds very reasonable. /s
8011 2018-01-11 14:23:41 Crypto markets are down this morning. Time to buy...
8012 2018-01-11 14:23:33 仮想通貨でレバwwwww
8013 2018-01-11 14:23:30 @FBI should use only the crypto they recommend, the same way @FCC should take the #MobileOnly Challenge.

8016 2018-01-11 14:23:23 If last night’s #crypto debacle told me (being in my infancy of this game) anything, it’s that the user base for crypto trading isn’t quite as mature as one perhaps should be. 

Panic selling gone awry, as well as others making a short sell to take advantage of a down market.
8017 2018-01-11 14:23:22 Might as well do one on Ox & Radar Rely too. Folks gonna start trading then they will want as many exchange options as possible
8018 2018-01-11 14:23:16 "Buffet needs to get on the bus" He missed on "Google" missed on "Amazon" now he's gonna miss on "crypto"!
8019 2018-01-11 14:23:07 Here I'm going to give you my best crypto picks

8021 2018-01-11 14:23:02 It's a beautiful night we looking for something dumb to do. Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you.
Good morning everybody.
8022 2018-01-11 14:23:00 If #SouthKorea bans #cryptocurrency I will eat my own dick on national tv. Not happening. Things will be fine. @officialmcafee @maxkeiser #bitcoin #altcoinarmy #altcoinnews
8023 2018-01-11 14:23:00 Funny because it is true. You are not content with Bcash being an alt even tho that is what it is, a premined heavily manipulated shitcoin at best. Not capable of gathering enough support so you attempt to manipulate the uninitiated. Bcash reputation is already tarnished
8024 2018-01-11 14:22:58 Very interesting, especially in the context of BTC.  So much focus has been on the size of the crypto bubble, but what about 30-YR T-Bonds?
8025 2018-01-11 14:22:50 XRPXRPXRP
8026 2018-01-11 14:22:46 Bitcoin or Crypto currency, the underworld/ shadow businesses is shifting, they don't want cold cash anymore.  Feds wants to regulate it now.
8027 2018-01-11 14:22:45 Ahhh I get it now. I thought it was your portfolio. I regret not buying ripple *cries*

I think Tron's really nice but aaaaa I heard China's shutting down crypto mines  Looking to invest in xvg, trx, ada, xrp, iota this year. Dunno which one's most profitable yet 
8028 2018-01-11 14:22:45 Every day in 2018 is going to be irl crypto day, Dale. They're all watching us now, and they want our coins. 
8029 2018-01-11 14:22:37 As always in crypto, 1% truth and 99% volatility. People are just bored / manipulating.
8030 2018-01-11 14:22:16 30% Bonus coins if you join Vestopia in Stage 1 of ICO.

8031 2018-01-11 14:22:13 The concept behind #KodakCoin is actually a massive opportunity and solves a real problem for photographers 

Just don’t think @Kodak has the bandwidth to slay that dragon #tech #crypto
8032 2018-01-11 14:22:04 When ICO? That’s sound like a rock solid investing if it become tokenized!

8034 2018-01-11 14:21:58 I look around and think damn... I should have been a crypto fictional character...
8035 2018-01-11 14:21:52 Even with such huge losses, I will never sell my $TRX, $XRP or any other coin. This loss is temporary, weak hands should never invest in #crypto. Time will reward your patience, stay strong.

8036 2018-01-11 14:21:52 yeah, I'm trying to figure this bot out so I can add XVG to my twitter verge address so that I can send tips to the team as I am able - but I can't seem to get the address - maybe the bot is down?  @XVGWhaleReal @justinvendetta @vergecurrency  - thoughts?
8037 2018-01-11 14:21:50 What is COINBASE doing with the numerous ETH crypto dividends being produced?
8038 2018-01-11 14:21:48 オイラはイーサを買い増しました。年初は10万切ってたのに、いつの間にか15万が底値のようになってしまいました。明らかに力強い感じがします。
8039 2018-01-11 14:21:47 Posting graphs doesn't solidify strategy. It is an angle of many angles. Newbies coming into crypto getting hyped off graphs and trying to become a TA expert are better off getting signals until they learn to DYOR.
8040 2018-01-11 14:21:45 $ICX is taking a breather right now, but this is going to be one of the coins of the year. If you want to be successful in #crypto you have to buy negative sentiment.
8041 2018-01-11 14:21:45 I know buddy.... But just see the fee... Do you feel it is viable... It is not for mass adoption than... Only for crypto traders only....
8042 2018-01-11 14:21:42 I wonder what the folks over at @GoldmanSachs saw in Crypto that changed their position on it

8054 2018-01-11 14:20:57 No hard cash only. The republic is still growing its economy, they can’t deal with crypto currencies right now
8055 2018-01-11 14:20:51 FF外から失礼致します。

いいよ！こいよ！リップル買い増しや！

8057 2018-01-11 14:20:46 I'm Irish but I don't mind being stereotyped because it's probably true most of the time. I like eating potatoes, I get drunk fairly regularly and I hunt leprechauns, not because I don't like them. I just want their pot of gold so I can sell it and put the proceeds into crypto.
8058 2018-01-11 14:20:43 Don’t tip toe around the crypto lol
8059 2018-01-11 14:20:43 Instagram partnership right?

8061 2018-01-11 14:20:38 En kötü kararımdı şu lmc coine yatırım yapmak. Ben crypto piyasasında hem airdrop açıklayıp hem partnership açıklayıp ki sağlam bir firma açıkladılar bu kadar dump yiyen rezil bir coin görmedim. Çıkamıyorum da. 500 satslara geri dönmesi çok yakın. Hayatımın kazığını yedim.

8065 2018-01-11 14:20:32 仮想通貨は相場が未成熟なので、Twitterの有名人が煽っただけで小さいコインは簡単に上昇します。沢山資金を入れた人がバゴーンと売却しただけで暴落します。自分で情報を探り、耳触りの悪いニュースも含めて冷静に向き合わないと、すぐお金が溶けますよ。投資で嫌な思いをする人が増えるのは嫌です。
8066 2018-01-11 14:20:31 Hah, we'll see how much traction that gets lol...
8067 2018-01-11 14:20:30 When ICO? That service looks promising if tokenized

8072 2018-01-11 14:20:23 According to my sources in South Korea: when they started to write the law that would ban Bitcoin and #crypto trading, someone was like “wait a minute I thought this was South Korea and not the North”

Then people were like “oh yeah”, hugged each other and then went dancing.
8073 2018-01-11 14:20:18 SNOVio is the first decentralized lead generation platform. Instead of having irritating telemarketing calls for promotions, their application combines SaaS and marketplace models to generate leads and target people with relevant information which can be used.

8083 2018-01-11 14:19:45 In our roundup of crypto news you might have missed this week..1/
8084 2018-01-11 14:19:43 rEb8TK3gBgk5auZkwc6sHnwrGVJH8DuaLh (Tag: 107239344)
8085 2018-01-11 14:19:39 I think .50 is a nice safe bet. A year is a long time. As TRX moves past the FUD i dont see how TRX doesn't increase at a min of at least 3 cents a month which would put it at 47 cents, so .50 yes higher is always a possibility!!
8086 2018-01-11 14:19:35 このまま上抜けある？ｗ
8087 2018-01-11 14:19:33 Neither because crypto is as shady as a 2008 mortgage backed security...
8088 2018-01-11 14:19:32 come in france even if we litterally noobs on crypto
8089 2018-01-11 14:19:27 I’m expecting a 130% increase to my portfolio in 14 days after this. #loadupandchill
8090 2018-01-11 14:19:21 Dogecoin does not need to be on Coinbase yet. Crypto cap needs to grow substantially before introducing a new source of volatility to the coin and its network.  It's not time yet and I hope that's recognized. Request also sets up coin for bad press upon formal rejection.
8091 2018-01-11 14:19:17 Step by step process for buying crypto currency. Coinbase is simple but only offers 4 currencies and I became very confused when I wanted to buy other currencies like Ripple or Verge.
8092 2018-01-11 14:19:15 This fork will never happen.. all this is a legendary $ZCL pump that will not end well for most. Al ot of buyers got sucker sold by a pretty website.
8093 2018-01-11 14:19:13 Well, bitcoin is relatively low now and I only buy crypto when it's at the peak 
8094 2018-01-11 14:19:13 Also note that wall street starting to turn its view on crypto. Comparing btc to gold as a store of value. 

Hodl through the fud.
8095 2018-01-11 14:19:11 No one thinks "crypto market is banned" here in S.Korea but kimchi premium is lowered now.
8096 2018-01-11 14:19:05 Wait. Is viabtc that place where you buying dreams of wealth and immortality? If they shuts down who will accelerate my tx for free when crypto terrorists like @rogerkver and @JihanWu will try slow the network??? Ohh wait. There is "LN" to the rescue. "music in back round..."
8097 2018-01-11 14:19:04 Ahhh yeah! @bgarlinghouse at last! We've been waiting for you for so long
8098 2018-01-11 14:19:04 Yes absolutely. But additional we must also pay close attention to the #FUD and the hype in the #crypto market because the charts go where people's minds go. The #WeakHands are in the majority, and as such if you know when they are about to panic you can make some nice trades
8099 2018-01-11 14:19:00 He can somehow with certainty call the crash of crypto even though he knows nothing about it.. Speaks volumes in itself.
8100 2018-01-11 14:18:52 Now all the #FUD is over, lets see $BTC rise up like a dick at 8AM.

8102 2018-01-11 14:18:31 The banning of Crypto currency trading in S. Korea might be a good sign in the long run. I would not worry too much about what S. Koreans do and this will have very little impact to Bitcoin, IMO

8108 2018-01-11 14:18:09 South Korean #bitcoin exchanges start selling off because Western exchanges are selling off... Western exchanges are selling off because of BREAKING NEWS from South Korea which apparently they didn't react to.
8109 2018-01-11 14:18:06 @SatoshiLite Charlie Lee is what we call in england a straight talking geezer. Now the thing with characters like this is they personify this demeanor because they KNOW good shit’s about to happen. #litecoin

8139 2018-01-11 14:16:06 There always is fear, uncertainty & doubt in any market. Is not over in this case. The Ministry of Justice still is drafting a bill to ban crypto exchange trading regardless of what the Ministry of Finance & Strategy has said.

8143 2018-01-11 14:15:52 The price correction is healthy for it long term. So many people have too high an allocation into crypto that they freak and sell when it dips a little. The sharp money never waivers.

8149 2018-01-11 14:15:33 For 5500 rupees you will get a maximum of 8000 coins and count accordingly and invest wisely.  Good luck.

8156 2018-01-11 14:15:06 If you haven’t bought crypto yet and you’re on the fence just buy Bitcoin or Ethereum today. Simple toe dip. Coinbase is easy as Venmo. Go buy $50 or $100 worth: it could be the best investment of your life, and if not it’s literally $50 (a blouse). Can’t win if you don’t play.

8247 2018-01-11 14:08:28 The best way I found to lower risk when investing in crypto is to make it an add-on strategy. Mix it with your stocks and options strategy. It makes you care a lot less about the crypto dips

8293 2018-01-11 14:05:20 Crypto trading has helped me increase my risk appetite and understanding. I have bought coins at ath and I have also sold coins very early. Had losses in the mean time but due to the bullish market, still ended up being profitable. This is actually a lesson. #Cryptocurrency
8294 2018-01-11 14:05:17 My theory about #crypto price movements.

1) On most days, new investors are pouring in, pushing prices up 1-5% daily
2) Occasionally, a "whale" sells a big stake ==> 20-30% price drop
3) For now, hardcore believers have stepped in to "buy the dip", believing #1 will continue
8295 2018-01-11 14:05:16 @Ripple before 10 days the @Ripple graph was going higher , and total crypto discussions was on @Ripple only even on @YouTube also. But suddenly the value of @Ripple gone down, is there any manipulations ???
8296 2018-01-11 14:05:13 Not always "FUD" right, China did ban crypto exchange trading, and Korean may still do so even if highly unlikely.
8297 2018-01-11 14:05:12 Can literally make more money investing in crypto that I can selling stuff on FBA. Crazy pants.
8298 2018-01-11 14:05:10 Crypto crash scenario: 1. Slide >20%. 2. Centralized exchanges fail under load. 3. Decentralized exchanges, while extremely expensive, stay up. ERC0 tokens panic sold for #ETH, boosting price/confidence. 4. Exchanges periodically pop up for minutes. 5. Non-ETH tokens devastated.

8315 2018-01-11 14:03:49 I think at this point, the #crypto #community needs a website that tells the masses how much each government/country contributes to the crypto market to avoid FUDs like this. #cryptocurrency #bitcoin #ethereum #ripple
8316 2018-01-11 14:03:40 Please cite credible sources... These are complete bullshit articles and complete FUD. Any decent amount of research into what is actually happening would make you realize this. Mainstream media loves to spread crypto fud

8322 2018-01-11 14:03:13 Just to be clear to all #XRP #Ripple investors, 
1) The whole crypto market is correcting, not just #XRP. There seems to be a lot of news about "Why is #XRP falling".  It is all cryptos, not just XRP.
2) Note that XRP went from 25cents to over $3 at its peak within a few weeks
8323 2018-01-11 14:03:06 I bought the dip and will sell it back to you all at a higher price.

8408 2018-01-11 13:57:35 @CNBC - #SouthKorea has been talking about crypto regulation for a long time. There is abuse in their markets, investors there can pay 30% more than others for the same coin. #cryptocurrency trading will regulated there, not banned.
8409 2018-01-11 13:57:33 Always depends where the money is coming from and what it goes into, but I'd wager >90% of crypto traders provide less societal value than (for example) an ambitious STEM graduate.

8415 2018-01-11 13:57:04 It is thanks to volatility that I am enriched. Because the fiduciary money system collapses, and that Bitcoin fuses, that I earn money. Without the bankruptcy of one and the success of the other, no gain to be made.
8416 2018-01-11 13:57:01 Well. If it does turn out to be a scam, I’ll only lose the 50 mco which I got solely for the card reservation. So no biggie. I’m not interested to invest in tokens without functionality, but would really love a crypto card,

8422 2018-01-11 13:56:37 C'est grâce à la volatilité que je m'enrichis. Parce que la monnaie fiduciaire s'effondre, et que le Bitcoin fuse, que je gagne de l'argent. Sans la faillite de l'un et le succès de l'autre, pas de gain à faire.

Crypto currency isn't open border, it's universal border. Is not any market, it is legal market only. It will filter out the monopoly money injected by fau government. Yes please, thank you.
8430 2018-01-11 13:55:50 Ripple could be a first step towards full decentralization. But if we'll see that happen in our lifetime..... still too many hurdles to overcome. But crypto sure is a good step forward.
8431 2018-01-11 13:55:40 Like complete invalidation of all public key encryption security. Crypto-currency will be the least of concern. :)
8432 2018-01-11 13:55:29 한국 정부에서 거래소폐쇄 라는 극단적인(강력한) 규제를 던져 트레이더들의 심리를 떠본것 같은데, 이후 반발이 심하다보니 특별법 제정은 확정된 것이 아니라고 보도. 

트레이더-정부규제 간 승자는 누굴까?

8437 2018-01-11 13:55:14 Makes sense -- just wish the bots were accumulating for my wallet rather than someone else's. If the current $TRX ATH pattern continues, I'd expect the next parabolic run to hit 2500 (ish) sat range before sell off, yeah?

8439 2018-01-11 13:54:52 guarda, l'argomento crypto è molto complesso e altrettanto affascinante, quello che posso assicurarti è che molti di quelli che ci stanno scrivendo su lo fanno per sentito dire. Oggi come oggi è difficile orientarsi su questo argomento perchè è una vera giungla >>>
8440 2018-01-11 13:54:46 It’s surprising how often the phrase “the rich get richer” comes up when I talk to people who started learning about crypto “early”

8456 2018-01-11 13:53:36 The biggest mistake you can make in #crypto right now is to obtain your news/information from the mainstream media. They're either uninformed, late, or pushing an agenda. Your best bet for getting crypto news as it happens is twitter.

8458 2018-01-11 13:53:34 CNBC Reporting on the huge "power consumption" on crypto currency mining.  I mentioned a while back that this would become a huge issue in the future.  Just wait until the politicians get involved.

8489 2018-01-11 13:50:59 Ok.... for me the response is that crypto is not a buble and if its not a buble, it can't explode... 
8490 2018-01-11 13:50:59 If you think that crypto and wealth is the only and the most important key to a happy and fulfilled life, you are eventually going to experience a rude awakening. True happiness and fulfillment never comes from the external world, it comes from within.

8571 2018-01-11 13:45:17 Just one reason for 14k usd at $btc price: we see next time 40K ... that price is in my eyes the minimum real price for #BTC
8572 2018-01-11 13:45:13 S Korea drafting bill to ban crypto currency trading. Bitcoin down 8% today.

8575 2018-01-11 13:44:51 If you are asking about price then the long term price after the market stabilizes and volatility is gone, (assuming this happens) will depend on the size of the market that will be using XRP and the supply of XRP out there. @JoelKatz please correct me if i m wrong 3/3

8579 2018-01-11 13:44:29 as a skeptical crypto optimist, this encapsulates the short term value of crypto perfectly. See Warren Buffet's comments.
8580 2018-01-11 13:44:28 This is a 3rd generation crypto currency and will surpass Bitcoin, Etherium and all other 1st and 2nd generation. It offers enormous independence from any government or bank not to mention that the potential for a cryptocurrency inside a widely adopted messaging app is enormous.
8581 2018-01-11 13:44:23 But its about to burst ( i got mine at 11 so im relaxed)

8584 2018-01-11 13:44:09 woah. total coin supply 246,203,093 with current price of $2.90 gives a market cap of $714,000,000. Too rich for me...
8585 2018-01-11 13:43:52 @expathos goeie dag richard ik heb een paar vragen over crypto wereld zou u mij een bericht willen sturen. al vasy bedankt groetjes danny
8586 2018-01-11 13:43:43 It says holders will get two tokens if there's a move to another network (stellar is mentioned). This wouldn't be right, surely you'd exchange on set of tokens to get the other
8587 2018-01-11 13:43:40 @TheRealXinxi This is my fear with crypto. That it will be banned. Banks & governments could easily do it. Banning exchanges. This is why we want crypto, to give power to the people. Banks & governments will not relinquish power. Why do we allow them to have such control over us?
8588 2018-01-11 13:43:28 Given that these advantages are real, there is no logical reason for banks not to use XRP instead of any other currency specially that the Ripple net is optimized in a way to work best with XRP. If you are asking about how it correlates to the price then this is another story 2/3

8614 2018-01-11 13:41:14 Thus, we've pinpointed that for starters it is "safer" to invest in a cryptocurrency that has had a great run in the past. In addition to that, we could have made a list with 50 currencies...but it's better to narrow it down to the wining options. Cheers!

8617 2018-01-11 13:41:06 Financial news outlets report on crypto rather irresponsibly. If you see a lot of coins lose value,  visible by change in overall market cap, it's because people are cashing out. There isn't even a trillion invested overall,  any cash out event will temporarily swing #s heavily.

8638 2018-01-11 13:39:12 @6BillionPeople good call on DLT via the Cryptocurrency messaging group. Anyone that followed that trade would have made a nice profit.
8639 2018-01-11 13:39:07 I have to say LTC as the medium of transfer is fantastic.  It does what BCH does but so much better, maybe this is why @SatoshiLite does not have to constantly tweet how good LTC is and how bad BCH & BTC are.  A lesson for the @BITCOlNCASH tweeters for sure.
8640 2018-01-11 13:38:57 As governments play many roles of trusted intermediaries, crypto would reduce citizen’s dependence on governments. But new roles may emerge for governments.
8641 2018-01-11 13:38:43 Do you #Crypto folks have a word for "Shoulda sold this shit yesterday"?

8651 2018-01-11 13:38:00 As long as BTC is still by far the biggest crypto, I prefer to go up in sats. Right now most exchanges sell alts for BTC anyway. Everytime BTC dips, most alts dip as well. Everytime BTC goes back up slowly - the alts go green. Market's pretty much still tied to BTC atm.

8662 2018-01-11 13:36:48 We know Dollar is inflationary (so will be Dai) and has a higher overall inflation than any limited supply crypto currency (after a while). So on macro crypto price grows till when adoption rate becomes 100, then crypto itself (or a fund based off of) will become stable.

If #DBC drops below 0.30 and #DOT below 0.05 they both represent good value to get in late, with gains expected when alts bounce back.

8724 2018-01-11 13:31:28 You ain’t lyin bro, it’s these media outlets trying to purposely crash what the people build. I mean don’t we all think it’s ironic the system went from pushing #crypto fear talks on #national television to “strategic #investment talks” followed by immediate tax laws. #whatajoke
8725 2018-01-11 13:31:24 I’m not sure if the #crypto market gets more matured with age or more naive. When the hell the South Korea become China ?¿!!! #cryptocurrency #bitcoincommunity #ethereum #litecoin #ripple #substratum
8726 2018-01-11 13:31:24 Regulated exchanges. We’re starting to see a healthy crypto atmosphere in 2018.
8727 2018-01-11 13:31:17 Great post @d_ramsden — #Crypto is by its very definition a platform. The flywheel effect is driven by how many people use it & believe in it. The underlying tech must be sound and many projects will die, but the survivors will be propelled forward by the believers.

8732 2018-01-11 13:31:06 @DeepOnionx is more than a golden nugget. This privacy crypto has a really active team of developers, TOR integration, strong community, great price, promising Roadmap, lots of features and it's not based on hype, but rather based on great work from the team.
8733 2018-01-11 13:31:01 That's when you go for that "unfollow" button
8734 2018-01-11 13:30:57 There are other ways to grow wealth besides crypto. People need to work to provide necessities for you to sit at home and trade on your computer. Quit acting like you're a fucking innovator.
8735 2018-01-11 13:30:56 South Korean government bought the dip
8736 2018-01-11 13:30:49 Thanks to you I think I am starting to understand TA.  Do you have panels open on each option to trade from? How fast is your internet? Thank you for all you have taught me. Who do you use to clear your crypto trades?
8737 2018-01-11 13:30:48 Banning crypto altogether in SK would be akin to Prohibition in the 20s.

Also on Customer Service - Can I reset my password i forgot it.
8743 2018-01-11 13:30:23 Not even a little
8744 2018-01-11 13:30:23 The article is mainly about bitcoin but the Goldman Sachs analysis refers to all digital currencies in general. “Digital currencies should be thought of as low/zero return or hedge-like assets, akin to gold or certain other metals." That’s where I disagree.

8749 2018-01-11 13:29:50 Regulating (transparency and tax) is not banning. The swing in price is typical in #crypto . If they ban it, they will piss off millions of people globally for many reasons but will not affect the #crypto market in the medium or long term. This is a good

8761 2018-01-11 13:28:53 $XLM.X I had a dream last night.. The whole crypto was red an in a panick because of Korea !! An I woke up at everything was fine.
8762 2018-01-11 13:28:48 Made a HUGE discovery on macro charts to explain crypto movement. Found an Evening Star Candle so high up, you won’t see it on regular monitors. Had to project my screen vertical onto a white birch tree trunk. As they say, “The Doji hides where the Doji lives.” #Crypto #trading
8763 2018-01-11 13:28:48 Dolaşımda toplamda 27 milyon tane olacak, sınırlı sayıda olması da fiyatını ciddi derecede etkileyeceğini gosteriyor, elinin altında bulunsun ;)
8764 2018-01-11 13:28:46 billionaires are fuding the market to get better positions on coins. Warren Buffet i really feel is just an old mind thts been closed off that or he is fearful of the new paradigm thats been born. Crypto isnt going back in the box its here to stay far too much money in it.
8765 2018-01-11 13:28:44 Matter advised to the concerned official   @Drm_Agra  Please look into it.
8766 2018-01-11 13:28:41 @crypto_rand is no. 1 at this.
8767 2018-01-11 13:28:40 Is talking-about-crypto-currency the new talking-about-crossfit?
8768 2018-01-11 13:28:30 Funny how in traditional market this takes years and in #Crypto it takes a month
8769 2018-01-11 13:28:28 The XRP market is still bearish at $1.69. I don't think DMM Bitcoin has any impact on this, if they do we would have seen a change in price by now.

I just hate it when people start telling things they don't know.
8770 2018-01-11 13:28:25 I am sure you do some irrational things with your money, everyone does (casino, fantasy football, online poker, drinking, etc...). Instead of spending irrationally on whatever your vices are, funnel that cash to the crypto market. Or don’t. Who really cares in the end
8771 2018-01-11 13:28:25 I am still waitingn to know about my  ETH withdraw yesterday... where is it??

8778 2018-01-11 13:28:01 GL! Also don't worry... If this absolutely insane prediction ever happens, my holdings in non-XRP crypto will be worth millions. I will personally buy & get trained on the latest tattoo removal machines. I will remove those tats for you bud  say this tweet 
8779 2018-01-11 13:27:57 Everybody reporting on Crypto falling 11% but nobody talking about how it's gone up over 1000%.
8780 2018-01-11 13:27:57 It was a long day for Korea’s crypto-community. No ban on the exchanges, confirmed by the Blue House (Korea’s WH).
8781 2018-01-11 13:27:54 The cryptocurrency market has no regulation, the president could quite literally create a rumour to manipulate price down and nothing would be investigated further. Welcome to crypto world.

8796 2018-01-11 13:27:06 1) at the top, it’s a very small, very homogeneous group of men who control most of the market – and they will openly conspire to destroy value over petty disagreements 

2) the men at the top of crypto are as bad as (if not worse than) the men at the top of traditional finance
8797 2018-01-11 13:27:01 It is fascinating how much market manipulation is going on in #crypto and $BTC. I am actually happy about all this #FUD due to two reasons:

1. cheaper $BTC
2. $ALTS dip so you can buy the blood

8800 2018-01-11 13:26:47 I'm bearish medium term (weeks-months) return to $2k is possible TA wise but requires a bigger trigger such as exchanges being shut down/USA investigation/tether pop - which are inevitable events imo. Long term (months-years) I'm still very bullish.
8801 2018-01-11 13:26:43 For all of you going gong-ho over IoTs and having wet dreams of self-driving cars and « intelligent » cities, current flaws in the silicon we buy, weak apps making crypto useless and general code bugs should make you very very worry about all of it
8802 2018-01-11 13:26:34 #BTC for me is like a zombie apocalypse. Everyone think that they will be the one who will survive until the end to save the world when actually most of us will fall on the first wave

8825 2018-01-11 13:25:02 True but bruttle. He Is saying the same thing about crypto that he said about tech in 1998 he was right and he is right in both cases. There’s not a damn one of you they can value these cryptos. The same thing was true in 1998 for Internet starts an 2001 provided it.
8826 2018-01-11 13:24:58 It's still possible to be within the pennant on a longer time scale with what I charted. I still think $BTC is relatively high risk all things considered and FUD being timed to break pennant support makes me a bit suspicious.

8844 2018-01-11 13:23:23 It was inevitable that hated coins like WTC would get shilled by the more experienced traders on crypto twitter eventually. Cup and handles make shit so predictable lol
8845 2018-01-11 13:23:22 FUD is over.  Time to get the crypto party started!. $BTC $LTC $ETH $EOS $BAT $XRP $XLM $POWR $ARN
8846 2018-01-11 13:23:22 Is there gonna be a prize or something for the author writing the millionth bitcoin is dead article?

Maybe everything just goes to the moon that day?

Somebody needs to make a site tracking how many times Bitcoin has died...

8848 2018-01-11 13:23:15 For anyone worried about the recent Korean news and the future of #cryptocurrency .. this FUD happens all the time.  It is a  consistent FUD pattern that plays out all the time in crypto.  It's also a great "sale" price to bring new money in and expand adoption.

8850 2018-01-11 13:23:12 Who is in Linda team
8851 2018-01-11 13:23:05 Thank you God & CNN i Just doubled my position in #Ripple
#cryptocurrency #FUD #SouthKorea
8852 2018-01-11 13:22:58 Not enough for me to see “something” go up, I need to know there’s intrinsic value to drive price action. That - to me - is rational. Crypto currencies fail this crucial test and by that measure, are not a rational investment. The only rational decision is to stay away.
8853 2018-01-11 13:22:56 Saw someone tweeting how he 'had seen a lot in crypto, but this dip is the fucking biggest yet'. Guy was serious as fuck, lol.
8854 2018-01-11 13:22:54 Nowdays all factory would to like to make own ICO, ( Telegram Kodak  etc...) this is only specultation. 
For me Crypto are only BTC and our first fork ( BTC and BTG), Ethereum , Monero, Litcoin, NEO, Zcash, and others few coin create before of this year.
New ICO are possible?
8855 2018-01-11 13:22:52 Yes, I agree, but is not only about the value of the investment is about the benefit of using a crypto for the rest of the people :)
8856 2018-01-11 13:22:48 Because coins are always fluctuating and it can either go up or drop to $0
8857 2018-01-11 13:22:43 nice to see how wall street are starting to control everything, wasnt crypto suppose to be without banks/goverment or did i miss something
8858 2018-01-11 13:22:36 No sera ni petro,ni crypto, ni virtual. Sera un Bono mas. Vamos a ver quidn lo recibirá .
8859 2018-01-11 13:22:31 Long may you reign bovine, @Crypto_God.
8860 2018-01-11 13:22:20 Unfortunately that's the unknown of the Crypto world, no one can tell what the price would be today or tomorrow, it's all a guessing game, but the more you accumulate then the more you have to redeem with potential good ROI you won't get elsewhere.
8861 2018-01-11 13:22:17 Seeing how most users in the crypto world already have and use Telegram and seeing how it supports mobile and stationary devices it was the logical choice over random (paid) alternatives. Also alert settings can be adjusted directly within our Telegram bot.
8862 2018-01-11 13:22:17 I just downloaded v4.0.1.0-e075115-funky-beta, but it does not connect to the network. any advice? address+port? thx!
8863 2018-01-11 13:22:11 I like your hustle. Need more people like you in the crypto game.
8864 2018-01-11 13:22:10 Why give up decentralization when you can have instant and low transaction cost. There were other crypto currencies before Bitcoin that failed because they were centralized. Let's not repeat mistakes of the past.
8865 2018-01-11 13:22:05 Yah it looks sweet. I’m gonna check it out. I’m more implying simple stuff for ppl like my friends who r texting me for crypto for the first time.
8866 2018-01-11 13:22:04 $lmc for sure! It's cheap at the moment. Great team... working product... send crypto instantly without fees in app, great marketing opportunities with LBS. I'm a huge fan. Makes crypto fun and bringing it to the masses.
8867 2018-01-11 13:21:47 If you can't stand to take that 30-50% temporary L , then the crypto game aint for you....people will wait every two weeks for a pay check, but don't wanna wait a few days for the market to bounce back....where is thy faith...? lol
8868 2018-01-11 13:21:42 A bad actor, either way.
8869 2018-01-11 13:21:27 다른건 어떤게 있을가 SYS?
8870 2018-01-11 13:21:25 So I added to some of my bags on the dip yesterday, nothing crazy but why not pad some positions
8871 2018-01-11 13:21:25 Opportuniste* haha
8872 2018-01-11 13:21:05 KodakCoin isn’t even the most dubious piece of Kodak’s random crypto pivot. They debuted the “Kashminer” at CES - a bitcoin mining rig that you can rent on 2 year contract. You pay upfront fee then Split the profits with Kodak.
8873 2018-01-11 13:20:59 Is it? Let’s see :). My plots are most of the time correct. Ive been doing these since UNI I finished my math degree 6 years ago the exact moment I fell in love with crypto.
8874 2018-01-11 13:20:58 To be aware of all upcoming crypto events is much easier now ! I like it !
8875 2018-01-11 13:20:56 $DPW Dip going quick everyone realized no ban on #crypto now everyone jumping back in! Tape is lit!
8876 2018-01-11 13:20:54 And a chance for equal financial opportunity.  This is what these greedy banks and corrupt governments fear most.

8880 2018-01-11 13:20:42 Yes, 100% agree.
8881 2018-01-11 13:20:19 Even though I #HODL my $TRX, I wasn’t expecting current support levels to hold. Despite all the hot air around #TRON, the price is actually quite healthy. I’m even thinking we could be seeing new resistance levels being tested soon. #cryptonomics #trading #cryptocurrency
8882 2018-01-11 13:20:19 $APPC looks good to bounce of lows here.
8883 2018-01-11 13:20:17 yes they can't "ban" the coins, but they actually could ban some exchanges especially the ones converting local FIAT into crypto. The connection to FIAT is where they could hurt if they wanted.
8884 2018-01-11 13:20:17 I've just realised the mainstream news outlets have been publishing the South Korean Exchange 'Ban' as outlandish claims such as 'RAIDS' or 'CRYPTO BANS' 

Did SWAT fly in through the roof via helicopters down ropes? 

No, they turned up and asked for tax/regulatory paperwork.
8885 2018-01-11 13:20:17 its a good news then
8886 2018-01-11 13:20:12 I have been burned in the stock market as badly as I have been burned in the crypto market. Don’t be too stubborn and old fashioned that you miss out on a window to make some extremely great gains.
8887 2018-01-11 13:20:05 Oh wait, is it replicant now? I am sooo confused!

8890 2018-01-11 13:19:52 Lmao no lie
8891 2018-01-11 13:19:50 $GCAP   South Korean people are addicted to crypto trading GCAP will benefit a lot, just open Australia and Singapore
8892 2018-01-11 13:19:49 If everyone put 0 fee on every crypto transaction, the network would speed up.  Processing all the fees and prioritising transactions based on fee size is the problem.  #Bitcoin #crypto #cryptosolutions
8893 2018-01-11 13:19:49 [2/2] South Korea responded saying that the only reason they are putting a law to ban crypto up for vote, is bc they don’t want their people hurt from crypto. They don’t trust or understand crypto so it’s understandable. That was their response to all the internet complaints.

8897 2018-01-11 13:19:40 I f#@&ing love crypto bans!!
8898 2018-01-11 13:19:39 "In the short term" is a bit worrying though!
8899 2018-01-11 13:19:37 REPはどうしてこの相場で強いんです？？
8900 2018-01-11 13:19:29 A new step to glorify binary chain is a full operated sysyem without any market control. Mining verium Reserve has to be propedeutical of generating that Minus portion of Vericoin to increase overall volumes. We need full operated binary chain.
8901 2018-01-11 13:19:12 Oh, a NULS connoisseur! Why am I not surprised? The cow likes money!
8902 2018-01-11 13:19:09 Bitcoin is down 31% over the past month while Ethereum is up over 100%, so naturally the Bitcoin True Believers are out in force telling you to just buy Bitcoin and avoid every other crypto
8903 2018-01-11 13:19:07 Around 50% of Bcash supporters literally only support it because they feel like they missed the bitcoin train & want it cheap again. Bcash will die, there is absolutely no doubt in my mind. Segwit coins are about to jump Bcash & take every penny it has! Someone wanna draw this!?

8905 2018-01-11 13:19:06 Exactly, there's so many 10/10 icos/presales right now that I won't feel bad for missing out on just a couple I had doubts about.

8920 2018-01-11 13:18:10 Ever experience a long time for Merca to process a withdrawal? Got another big bag of KIN I’m assuming it’s just the website trying to deal with a lot of sends and withdrawals just wanted to see if I’m not the only one.
8921 2018-01-11 13:17:58 With china banning crypto mining DPW has great potential. Crypto not going anywhere, we will see bumps, thats good sign. Real business to be made here and DPW has those resources, it is capitalism.
8922 2018-01-11 13:17:53 This is a great news finally a tier one IB admitting there is some legs. Personally took them long enough, banking needs to be reformed they not innovative enough and the choices offered to customers is poor expensive and bad service #blockchaintechnology #crypto

8926 2018-01-11 13:17:46 Like, there's a theoretical binary: a project is either open or closed source. But there is a functional/practical/strategic spectrum between open and closed source that crypto projects live in, based on low barriers to capital, markets, and speculation on the development.

8930 2018-01-11 13:17:32 I'm the man who gives it all and looks like I'm going to give it all for crypto
8931 2018-01-11 13:17:31 If you woke up today to see every $crypto in your portfolio in the red, just remember, if that was fiat money in your bank account, it would be red every day. Every. Single. Day. #inflation
8932 2018-01-11 13:17:22 You missed a full moon party on cryptopia shitcoins bro
8933 2018-01-11 13:17:13 The cool thing about the crypto market is that when I cash out my gains, I receive the exact same cold hard cash that I get when I cash out my stocks/bonds. If your in to making money and can make rational decisions, your missing out on another stream of income.

8936 2018-01-11 13:17:03 While I'm not a fan, I believe there will be a rebound on #xrp soon, such that it is a good buy atm for a swing or possible week hodl. Oh, and buy some #lumens #xlm, they're on hella sale #crypto
8937 2018-01-11 13:16:53 why would a bank trust ripple and not just host its own chain? rippled is open source and has trusted validators, spin up a private net.
8938 2018-01-11 13:16:46 what $? coin
8939 2018-01-11 13:16:30 Eh, you look at what caused 01 and 08 and it's different.  Maybe if crypto (which is trash) is a leading indicator of other overall super reckless behavior, but the crypto market generally is such a minor one

8952 2018-01-11 13:15:08 Ok so here’s the deal, crypto in Korea is way too popular for them to ban. They just had a president impeached and mass protest. If they do a full ban it will crash their own economy and people will be back in the streets again and committing suicide. I don’t need a source

8988 2018-01-11 13:12:37 @astellhorn you’ve been doing a lot of crypto retweeting. Have you won anything?
8989 2018-01-11 13:12:25 Exactly! Very misleading headlines by some #news agencies...
8990 2018-01-11 13:12:16 2-11% is nothing in crypto.
8991 2018-01-11 13:12:10 Same but I think in my case it’s beginners luck
8992 2018-01-11 13:12:05 @hitbtc needs to be served a class action lawsuit for misappropriation of customer crypto. Missing deposits and withdrawals.  What do you say? #lawsuit #classaction #hitbtc

8993 2018-01-11 13:12:01 thats crazy low. Thats a bloodshed moment for crypto.

8995 2018-01-11 13:12:00 Oh, I loaded up last night in the dip  :)    YEEEEEEEEEEE
8996 2018-01-11 13:11:46 Read @iamjosephyoung article.  There are 4 pieces of legislation.  They are not banning crypto.  They are restricting it to those who are "accredited investors".  The public will not be allowed to trade on exchanges.
8997 2018-01-11 13:11:44 Consider Crypto too volatile?! All the more reason to use a ROBOT . . .
8998 2018-01-11 13:11:40 If @B3Coins hits $1 per B3 in 2018 I’ll give away 1 FULL #bitcoin to a random person who  RETWEET and FOLLOW me !!!’#crypto #altcoins
8999 2018-01-11 13:11:37 normally btc and alts are negatively correlated, you get slightly +ve number because most crypto is going up in general
9000 2018-01-11 13:11:31 So where in the Satoshi whitepaper does it say that Bitcoin is forbidden for photographers? #Bitcoin #Kodakcoin #Kodak
9001 2018-01-11 13:11:25 I whitelisted as well but the way they handled the launch was very disappointing. Can they deliver the big things if they screwed up the smallest thing?

I'll need to research it more to be convinced.

9047 2018-01-11 13:08:09 Dear cyber colleagues, do you feel we have any advantage when investing in crypto currencies, due to our exposure?
Do you agree that the demand will only ever increase (in line with cybercrime trends/other)?
Is it ethical to invest in crypto currencies??
9048 2018-01-11 13:08:07 Crypto currency is the way to go, download nicehash and you can start making money
9049 2018-01-11 13:08:05 This project is the future of #crypto! Just consider:

9057 2018-01-11 13:07:18 looks like BCH is the black hole of crypto, sucking in money from the top 10.  BCH maximalist.
9058 2018-01-11 13:06:59 The technology is valid though and for $KODK it could even make sense. But the crypto currencies are not. I found a nice article on why it makes sense for $KODK to pursue a blockchain system, one of the very few times though it actually is beneficial for company.
9059 2018-01-11 13:06:57 Scam companies don't partner with real banks and businesses. Maybe you don't like that they are playing with banks but they are not a scam.

9062 2018-01-11 13:06:41 2017 was an epic ride in crypto - I believe it is over for the foreseeable future and adds little to the macro story - I have muted all things crypto from my feed (and it feels great!)
9063 2018-01-11 13:06:39 @justinsuntron , Are you forming a new team for a new crypto - odyssey/ ocoin? Why new one when u haven't made a lot of progress on TRX. Care to explain?

9083 2018-01-11 13:05:18 Bro ..i would advise you don't get involve with cryptocurrency, if you have very limited money, as it is a highly volatile market and you can easily lose out all your money. Only invest if you can afford to lose your money.
9084 2018-01-11 13:05:14 Can you please do TRX again...?
9085 2018-01-11 13:05:11 Seems really wrong. Today we saw the core of VeChain investors are not the typical guy that Fud with Korean baning exchanges. All coins going down while this is up just means that even if the whole crypto crashes this project will remain solid.

9104 2018-01-11 13:03:07 This is why I doubt Crypto will be adopted by business and people in general. How can a business use something so unpredicatable. If they are getting paid so and so US dollars worth of Crypto today for their work, they can literally lose 10% within a few hours.

2) Tax only the profit when it converted back to fiat.

Any other way it's illegal on my opinion. It's like taxing you the score on virtual game. #taxcrypto #bitcoin #cryptocurrency

9132 2018-01-11 13:01:45 People like to write such tripe on the remote chance that they may be right. If they are, they're lauded as oracles. If they're wrong, it goes down the memory hole, so they don't care. All they need is one contrarian biggie to come true and all the wrongs are forgotten.

9141 2018-01-11 13:01:20 How we should understand this? Government and Blue house cannot reach agreement on crypto trading and this is the reason of failing to establish a ban or regulation?

9143 2018-01-11 13:01:12 Poloniex is a bad cryptocurrency trading platform. Stay away from it if you don’t want to lose money! I think it would best to have a crypto to US dollar exchange and vice versa instead of the status quo that allows traders to trade only in BTC!

Rob (Crypto Bobby) is making an obvious but good point about not buying any crypto if it has recently been on a crazy run because it’s more than likely that people that bought at the bottom will take profits that will drop the price of x,y,z crypto.
9164 2018-01-11 12:59:37 Right, because "Looooooool. Ripple is garbage. Don't humiliate yourself anymore" sounds like smart money to you"? Haha, my condolences.

9190 2018-01-11 12:57:23 Put it this way your asking a crypto community who are biased on certain types of funds so they will ‘all’ tell you what to buy ok, if you are serious about cryptos and 50k you will research ‘each’ coin and decide which to buy otherwise you may as well be gambling at horse races
9191 2018-01-11 12:57:21 Probably because decentralized identities dont care about trademarks.

PoW changed to PoS. zPoS (crypto first), zDEX (crypto first), revamp MN voting system etc.

9204 2018-01-11 12:56:26 I'm not sure about that. But then again, I'm a true believer in crypto-currencies and really believe the technologies behind it will revolutionise the financial industry.
9205 2018-01-11 12:56:24 期待したいところですが、相場全体が大荒れですので、ルーモアが実現しなかった時のダウンサイドは大きいです。私はリップラーですが、そういうイベントドリブン的な投資は好きではありません。リップルが今のビットコインのような存在になれば自ずと広く流通するはずです。気長に見守りましょう。

9236 2018-01-11 12:54:49 I’m not here to knock Buffett or count his missed opportunities and I do think he’s right about crypto overall. Tons of new ICOs that will fail and investors will lose on, but it’s also a new space that we probably won’t recognize in even say 5 years.
9237 2018-01-11 12:54:40 Bitcoin's going to have a meteoric rise to about once the crypto crosses 1 Trillion Mkt cap. People will start seeing Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation like gold and use other cryptos like EOS (capable of 100k transactions/s) for micropayments.

I, and I think most others as well, would like more thought and work put into the marketing material/campaigns published regarding major uodates. That'll dramatically help longterm price stability/growth.
9311 2018-01-11 12:49:03 One issue with the crypto-currency payment/transfer use case (one of the largest) is that banks aren’t static target. Under competitive pressure they can make various services faster and cheaper. (ie. Compare services/fee structure for retail investing over past decades)

9409 2018-01-11 12:40:45 South korea's government's proposed ban on cryptocurrency trading will definitely affect the market,but a market with just peaks and no falls isn't a market..The crypto market weathered the Chinese ban on crypto-trading and came out stronger,south korea's is just another hurdle
9410 2018-01-11 12:40:43 Nothing in terms of crypto happening in Latvia right now. Government does not care. i will tweet this every day 365 days in a row and you'll see that this will be true!

9414 2018-01-11 12:40:27 1/ As far as Korea and crypto go.. I don’t think they’re going to outright BAN it. It’s merely regulation that’s happening. Same as China. It wouldn’t be in their interest to ban it altogether.
9415 2018-01-11 12:40:13 in theory programming language popularity should be correlated with market cap. the more popular a language, the more demand there will be for it. the more demand, the higher the market cap.

9431 2018-01-11 12:38:39 I shrug when people show me their portfolio and it doesn't even include Ethereum or Bitcoin. You have to give your portfolio something semi-steady. Don't bet everything on high volatile obscure coins. #ethereum #bitcoin #cryptocurrencies #crypto

9443 2018-01-11 12:37:30 How about $0. Digits on a screen have no meaning. Wake the fuck up
9444 2018-01-11 12:37:29 
9445 2018-01-11 12:37:20 I opened it. It crashed. Not sure if it is a feature or a bug
9446 2018-01-11 12:37:18 Not at all, it reached over $6.50 yesterday after the Jim Breyer news and it remains above $6 today even during the market crash. Imagine how high this will go once the market settles! Plus there are many announcements and a rebrand to come. #VEN #VECHAIN
9447 2018-01-11 12:37:13 If $Burst wants to stay down around the 500 sat level until tomorrow, I wouldn’t be too mad.  Planning on more than doubling my bag. 

I may be new to this, but I already know that if you can’t handle these swings, #crypto probably isn’t for you.
9448 2018-01-11 12:37:11 When/if #crypto holdings get regulated and people have to pay tax on it, how will the legislation tackle #Ethereum token airdrops? 
Any thoughts?

9452 2018-01-11 12:36:53 the strange thing with #crypto is that most people are not happy with the technology and the stable/increasing value but unhappy with only having return below any shitcoin that gets currently pumped #btc #eth
9453 2018-01-11 12:36:47 Pretty sure everyone was pretty clear that riding the crypto wave was gonna be pretty much what 2018 was about for anyone who owns it.
9454 2018-01-11 12:36:45 Cryptocurrencies are under global uttack (again). Former enemies (Jamie Dimon) who have investments in them started to defend crypto.

9460 2018-01-11 12:36:15 It is effecting it but what people don’t understand is that once a bill is created to ban crypto (if one is created) it will take many months, if not years to go through. It’s all FUD right now that’s effecting the market

9463 2018-01-11 12:35:57 They will never ban it.. Its so obvious! Its so stupid that people believe it day by day when there is a new announcement. They get taxes from all the crypto and individually those guys can make money too! Who will stop that? Come on..

9471 2018-01-11 12:35:14 I admittedly speak from a position of ignorance here, but the crypto-currency thing does feels like multi-level marketing sometimes. Maybe because of the way some of you push it...

9498 2018-01-11 12:32:58 Irrespective of South Korea - or any country - bans #btc or not, the twist here is that the notion of #btc being independent of governments suffers a real challenge. I don't mean to generalize for all #crypto though

9518 2018-01-11 12:30:43 I think they mean that the draft of the bill banning crypto trading has to be passed by the parliament, which is unsure and mid term
9519 2018-01-11 12:30:34 #XPR #Bitcoin #ETH #crypto falling at the news of S. Korea plans to ban #cryptocurrency as it is causing ‘great concerns’ to government. Since they were trading at almost 30% premium, this should serve as price correction in market. My opinion, it’s temporary and will hit back
9520 2018-01-11 12:30:17 Yes! I think @justinsuntron did a lot to help that with his constant updates
9521 2018-01-11 12:30:14 In poker (card game) they say "fold is never a mistake".

To me it echoes with taking profits on the way up in crypto and not regretting if the price continues to go higher.

I mean, BE greedy af, but taking some profit is never a mistake.

9541 2018-01-11 12:28:56 Rumors this morning that South Korea is cracking down on crypto currencies. If true, it will be interesting to see if they have any control over this borderless currency. I suspect that either way the result will be further increases in the crypto currency values.
