2 2018-03-03 23:59:33 I was the Nutter Butters, wasn't it? ;)

Seriously though, my dad's got a super simple fish preparation that's UH-MEZZIN. Cod loins or another thick white fish, cover with Italian breadcrumbs mixed with olive oil to form a paste. In the oven for 20-ish minutes. SO EASY.

7 2018-03-03 23:58:51 when the Saudis started dumping oil a couple years ago, did that hurt the US economy?  did it even hurt our oil industry?  yes it took a hit, but now more efficient than ever.

10 2018-03-03 23:58:09 Hey Leo, must have missed you protesting the raw sewage being dumped, I guess all that time protesting the energy industry and oil tankers in your own country didn’t leave you with much to spare....
11 2018-03-03 23:57:57 What is your position on the shrinking of federal lands, like Bears Ears in Utah for the sole purpose to drill for gas and oil when the nation and the world is moving away from fossil fuels and investing in renewables.
12 2018-03-03 23:57:53 @SecretaryZinke Bears Ears not about oil? Lying fuck! Raping and pillaging this country is how you will go down in history. You amoral shit.
13 2018-03-03 23:57:50 Wow nice !
14 2018-03-03 23:57:50 you stood in front of a camera and admitted the reduction of Bears Ears was NOT for oil and gas drilling. Rot in hell for that lie.

40 2018-03-03 23:56:55 I’m obsessed with my essential oil diffuser
41 2018-03-03 23:56:37 It’s an epidemic! I have to go oil my garden now...
42 2018-03-03 23:56:37 I just ordered!!! Is the beard butter going to be back soon? (I totally ordered the oil and wash for my husband though!!) lol
43 2018-03-03 23:56:31 Stock 6.7 P/S oil pan RTV gasket > my willingness to knock it loose. Tightening it back up and filling it. Next 5K I'll take her to my local guy. #powerstroke
44 2018-03-03 23:56:24 And I believe alot of that Oil from North Dakota ends up in Eastern Canada.
45 2018-03-03 23:56:23 I have a guy bringing me a half ounce and a girl bringing me an oil pen. What a time to live in! #PreStonerThoughts
46 2018-03-03 23:56:15 Yessssss. This is the thing so many progressives (albeit not Noah, I suspect) miss about those who support policies that oppress. The vast majority of ‘em drink their own snake oil. It’s what makes them so dangerous.
47 2018-03-03 23:56:04 Girl I’ll get you a sample of the lemon essential oil to try if you want! Makes regular water holy water
48 2018-03-03 23:55:59 Thanks for helping get the dirtiest oil in North America to market. Trump and the rest of the USA appreciate your help.
49 2018-03-03 23:55:56 Don’t forget they voted down taxing the oil companies on their profits. 
They voted down taxing their biggest export because... oil/gas rules there. They’d eat it if they could.
50 2018-03-03 23:55:24 Had a bad headache and wife rubbed lavander oil on my neck and head. I fell asleep and Bam, headache is gone.
51 2018-03-03 23:55:22 The @jentealforreal sells CBD oil for pain that might help also.
52 2018-03-03 23:54:55 Well you might not be sure but we are telling you it is. Rigs are being moved from Canada to the US and there is a reason for that that the oil sands has nothing to do with.

55 2018-03-03 23:54:34 That's great news man, enjoy!
56 2018-03-03 23:54:08 In your dreams dear, the first to discover oil is Saudi, and this is also our land and then we kicked the Ottomans from our land

58 2018-03-03 23:53:44 Se que me mi cabello me ama en estos momentos, Jamaican black castor oil w/ shea butter, peppermint &keratin Shea Moisture hair mask + organic unrefined cocunut oil 
59 2018-03-03 23:53:41 For a moment, he was stunned by the view, but quickly recovered. Finding the appropriate cleaning accoutrements, he set to cleaining the oil off the floor.

"I do admire the work you do. Being an accomplished actress and soldier, and at such a young age, as well."
60 2018-03-03 23:53:41 I can see through the waiting room window that the guys changing my oil are gathered around my engine laughing uproariously and it’s stressing me out
61 2018-03-03 23:52:49 Zinke said “Bears Ears is not about oil & gas AT ALL” he said it was about “preservation”. Now we learn that was an effing lie, it’s all about selling oil and gas leases.
The Secretary is raping our natural resources and land.
62 2018-03-03 23:52:46 When government decided everyone should own a home even if they couldn’t qualify for a Gulf Oil card we had the housing crisis. Now everyone is supposed to go to college. Same thing will happen. Trade schools & apprenticeships needed.
63 2018-03-03 23:52:21 Lol there a few interesting trades I have my eye on sp500 2961, nat gas from 2.75, dax, and tlt, lot of hype on oil and gold but just don't trust in, rates going up is bad for gold

66 2018-03-03 23:52:01 I need an oil change someone do it for free
67 2018-03-03 23:51:53 @VampyBitme sorry about that, this is my twitter. I was the one with the chili oil and Bherna armor
68 2018-03-03 23:51:45 90 days! Wow that's impressive! Take a spoonful of coconut oil and call me in the morning.
69 2018-03-03 23:51:37 Ryan & Mcconnell would have held votes repealing car ins. By nowTrump would have deregulated seatbelts. Emissions tests, airbags, safety cut off valves at gas stations, allowed oil trucks on BW & GW parkway, & more
70 2018-03-03 23:51:29 Coconut oil is magical I swear
71 2018-03-03 23:51:28 People are unhealthy from long-distance food. Marine life is choking on the "goods."
Now cheap oil is over, the system is collapsing.
72 2018-03-03 23:51:21 Bio Oil. Get it anywhere,  works good.
73 2018-03-03 23:51:20 just changed the car's oil on my own like a big boy
74 2018-03-03 23:51:20 I've never fried an egg in olive oil before. Does it taste as goo ... #customerservice #money #virtualassisant
75 2018-03-03 23:51:15 The EU has also made unfair trade tariffs on edible oil imports from other countries while using environmental groups to push their agenda
76 2018-03-03 23:50:57 I'd love to see this bullshit claim just out of curiosity. I frequently use organic non-refined coconut oil with my silicone toys and have zero issues. Shoutout to you @dangerouslilly for proving people wrong one science experiment at a time. :)
77 2018-03-03 23:50:41 The worst of the human condition on display
78 2018-03-03 23:50:34 Remember:e evil is timeless. The guns are only their rattle, because the snake is the oil & all that comes with that. The climate is abruptly changing young man & we are all in danger. I am here to assist & will work to save the children while you discover your destiny.  B brave
79 2018-03-03 23:50:14 You do realise that the PRICE of oil is just as, if not more important?

If there’s no profit to be made the oil won’t be extracted.
80 2018-03-03 23:50:11 Snake oil salesman generally benefit 
No ONE!
81 2018-03-03 23:50:00 Why do we play these games when we know damn well you will line your pockets with "lobbying" (bribery) from the oil and gas industry. Btw you can't spend that $$ when you are in prison. #resist #minoritypresident #neverforget #lies #nazisinthewhitehouse
82 2018-03-03 23:49:57 There's oil:who knew?
83 2018-03-03 23:49:56 Well I just purchased this spartan oil Soo we’ll see what’s good don’t let me grow a beard this ego finna sky rocket!!!
84 2018-03-03 23:49:40 And going back to oil and those involved, it’s good for the wallet yes but it can get your suppliers in competition whereas lithium batteries you cannot.
85 2018-03-03 23:49:34 I need a nice baby oil body rub

88 2018-03-03 23:49:08 Good! That Republican Governor has given so many tax breaks to oil and cut and cut from the schools!
89 2018-03-03 23:48:39 @RyanZinke you are a bold-faced lier when you stood in front of a camera and said reducing Bears Ears was NOT about the oil and gas drilling. Funny thing is: we knew you were lying. Rot in hell.
90 2018-03-03 23:48:38 You might find a lot of those protesters are Canadian. And a lot of money behind the oil industry is foreign.

94 2018-03-03 23:48:06 I've officially brought Yoppy to tears
Is it a success? A failure? Nobody knows
Also, wouldn't he just cum motor oil?
95 2018-03-03 23:48:01 (4) In the 1970s growth was driven by aggregate demand expansion (mostly public investment & social spending) which was financed by oil  & debt. Mexico could not grow fast enough, & did not /could not raise  taxes, to avoid the macro imbalances.
96 2018-03-03 23:47:54 Dear Robert Mueller,
Please hurry and get Trump. He and his corrupt cabinet aided by our corrupt elected officials are destroying our country piece by piece. He and Sinks just reduced the size of Bear's Ears Monument by 80% so they can drill for oil & gas.Orrin Hatch is complicit
97 2018-03-03 23:47:51 STOCKS TO WATCH:

1. DAYANG
2. YINSON
3. PETDAG
4. SERBADK
5. SAPNRG

A rearch agency is expecting crude oil to trade at between US$60 - US$87. China will be the key driver for demand. These stocks can benefit from oil price recovery & stability.

98 2018-03-03 23:47:48 Wow! My daughter just left Oklahoma because of the low pay and accepted a job in Denver for much more money and considerably better working conditions. Oklahoma does not care about teachers, just oil & gas.
99 2018-03-03 23:47:45 I can relate!! My nose is the worst by far  but honestly they’re fab! Used to use the oil for stretched ears which get MEGA dry so!!
100 2018-03-03 23:47:15 Thanks to @BackdraftMixer got my order of @Fisticuffswax Viking Oil and beard balm, can't wait to feel the difference!

102 2018-03-03 23:46:53 Fortune's on the side if the oil companies. That's their readership.
103 2018-03-03 23:46:46 Lol..I have a theory on men who’s hair thins,but I’ll save it...Jamaican Black Castor oil a few times a week will help 
104 2018-03-03 23:46:43 Right you are. Never too proud to be a waiter when I was younger. Bartender too. Raked sand traps at the golf course. Wheeled cement on a concrete crew. Finally got on the oil rigs. Thought I was king of the world! Whatever it takes. Be your own man.
105 2018-03-03 23:46:21 Only takes me 15-30 mins bc the oil filter is hard to reach in my motor they over there scratching they asses

110 2018-03-03 23:45:27 Who cares?
111 2018-03-03 23:45:18 @SecretaryZinke is scum. I bet he's bought by big oil and gas. There can't be any other motivation.
112 2018-03-03 23:45:13 Of course war with North Korea will be worth it. Iraqi oil paid for the Iraq War too, and the world is so much more secure!
113 2018-03-03 23:45:12 I wonder if it matters if they're non-gmo, fried in coconut oil, with natural seasalt... 
114 2018-03-03 23:45:10 I was having a bomb ass outfit day & of course I accidentally sat in a puddle of oil 
115 2018-03-03 23:45:10 Sec. of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, shrinks Bear’s Ears National Park by 85%. Oil & gas contracts are planned for this national treasure. Destroying our natural resources, this administration is Shameful and Greedy. Why are we allowing this to happen?
116 2018-03-03 23:45:09 Goodness, with their money, I'm sure they could afford proper grooming on a regular basis, the best foods w/ lots of top-grade fish oil, etc...
I think it's important for children to have pets too. Barron is missing out.
I can see Trump w/ a Foxhound or a German Shorthair Pointer
117 2018-03-03 23:45:01 Alright.  It's a "fry pan"... assuming you shallow fry in 2 inches of oil......
118 2018-03-03 23:44:49 Forget about it Syria doesn't have any of the three things that the u.s. invades for.
No oil no gold no heroin... hence no intervention in Syria...
119 2018-03-03 23:44:45 The Kurds got so much land, oil and weapons both in Syria and Iraq with the help of USA. It is time for Turkey to work with the Syrian government, the Iranian government and the Iraq central government to stop this USA sponsored plan to make endless ethnic wars in the region.

121 2018-03-03 23:44:26 it doesn't care about subsidization.  it just says i buy cheaper to save my own resources. cheap steel?  great i'll make cars, bridges, oil pipelines, buildings...do you really think economies selling below cost are going to do better than their customers?
122 2018-03-03 23:43:55 My freshman year of college, my yiayia brought to my dorm room a bottle of olive oil, a cucumber, 2 tomatoes, and a knife as a gift. #Greeks

124 2018-03-03 23:43:33 Madelaine Albright once said 500,000 Iraqi kids sanctioned to death was "worth it". I think by 'It' she meant oil, profits for military industrial complex including Dick Chebey and Haliburton.

So THIS is my future. 
127 2018-03-03 23:42:57 ..vehicles. For example, my 90k Michelins, will last about 65k miles. My lifetime warranty brake pads last about 18 months. 

C: "average speed p/hr with app on."

D: Some parts wear down while idling which drivers can spend hours doing every day. That's why oil change = 4k miles
128 2018-03-03 23:42:43 Yeah it’s all amazing and just that size oil is $40 so it’s worth it IMO

142 2018-03-03 23:40:29 I’ve tried need more oil 
143 2018-03-03 23:40:23 Trump what about the MASSIVE farm and oil subsidies. Start in your own back yard. Why are all the BIG RICH Agriculture Companies getting a free pass when they hire THOUSANDS of illegals?  You KNOW where they are. PICK THEM UP TODAY!!! hypocrite.
144 2018-03-03 23:40:21 Me neither. I remember Faisal... We go back to 40s-50s together...very tight relationship w State Dept,Big Oil & the old Saudi Kings (who grew up to take an interest in what was going on.)
145 2018-03-03 23:40:17 Pretty nice day outside, the weather improving definitely helps. I also bought some lavender essential oil. Its pretty darned relaxing smelling. now if only i would wake up and my stomach stop being intolerant to ice cream i'd be set.
146 2018-03-03 23:40:16 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
147 2018-03-03 23:40:08 @RepDonBeyer How can you say your SHOCKED at finding out that OIL had a hand in Trump wanting to sell off National lands.  I find that insulting that you would say it or pretend you were shocked.  We all know DJT is doing it for oil companies & probably getting a side cut.
148 2018-03-03 23:40:02 Driving past an oil/petrol tanker. One day it's just going to explode for no reason.
149 2018-03-03 23:39:50 If your main source of income is oil corruption is easy & hard to stop the #Venezuela / #SaudiArabia model wouldn’t work in the U.K.

157 2018-03-03 23:38:18 A lot of people don't like Bengali food because of the mustard oil...
158 2018-03-03 23:37:56 You previously said that you find that the tarte shape tape is drying under the eyes, so you put oil. Do you dab it on prior or in with the concealer?
159 2018-03-03 23:37:55 Give my puppers CBD oil daily. Much fantastic benefits and no psychoactive properties like there are with THC. However a tiny bit of THC can help kick in the effects of CBD plus the CBD negates any negative THC effects 
160 2018-03-03 23:37:31 I was making potatoes and hot oil spilled on me. What did I do to deserve thissssssss
161 2018-03-03 23:37:31 Spoilers: Venezuela's economy depended on solely on oil and oil prices tanked.

165 2018-03-03 23:36:48 Beware of PureKana 1000mg CBD oil product. I bought it and tried it - worthless! Colored flavored liquid! NO CBD benefits. And PureKana wouldn't refund my $100+ payment! TOTAL RIP-OFF! Ask me for more details.

167 2018-03-03 23:36:09 interference in parts of the world that produce oil is not just about regime change, it includes arms sales and the profits can exceed the cost of war (if you ignore lives lost)
168 2018-03-03 23:36:06 G it's embarrassing u haven't won the champs lge all the billions u spent how long is it again since the oil counts come in
169 2018-03-03 23:36:02 And if City had not received any oil money they could be in as much debt as Utd!
170 2018-03-03 23:35:50 Take the next step @SecretaryZinke after cancelling the #ChacoCanyon oil/gas lease --  give the land permanent protection!
171 2018-03-03 23:35:39 acupuncture. oil change + repairs. paid rent. trader joes. that’s enough productivity for one day?
172 2018-03-03 23:35:36 [exhale] I stay hotter than a single-file line, call it olive oil. Lord.
173 2018-03-03 23:35:11 Although it’s not certain if that many barrels are really recoverable. Of course oil companies like to book more to help share prices!

175 2018-03-03 23:34:46 Hope you get to feeling better SOON!!  Have you ever tried Thieves essential oil?  I always use that whenever there are flu symptoms going around my house.  It has shortened the length and severity of the flu by a lot!!
176 2018-03-03 23:34:30 Flour, salt, oil, yeast. And a sprinkle of knowledge gives bread.

Enjoy.

Probably best if practiced beforehand.

178 2018-03-03 23:33:39 When I was a kid, I had a neighbor whose mom wore Youth Dew, or rather lived it. She had scented soap, drawer liners, body powder, bath oil, and everything else they make. The air in that house was almost too thick to breathe.
179 2018-03-03 23:33:34 $15.6 bn Revenue minus $13/bbl operating cost for the oil.
180 2018-03-03 23:33:22 Future generations will ask, how did things work back in the Oil Age?
181 2018-03-03 23:33:20 Either someone is cooking with coconut oil or I just had a hallucination. I was playing #minecraft and got stuck in the neither. I made some mushroom soup in game and smelled Thai style mushroom soup.

184 2018-03-03 23:32:56 In my house this would call for many naughty words and a few diatribes.  All I can think of is to let a bit of oil seep between the stuck parts.
185 2018-03-03 23:32:51 Lets see, EU is the home of Mercedes, Audi, Jaguar, Rangerover, dont beef them from US, dont need your steel, aluminum, oil, gas, coal, lumber, we make our own aircraft, what we dont have we can procure from Russia, China, Japan, so really, EU can live without US imports,
186 2018-03-03 23:31:36 Only one losing will be the BMw and Mercedes mechanics  The ones that charge $700 for an oil change. 
187 2018-03-03 23:31:23 Just to clarify. Mia Wallace was tryna smash Vincent Vega in oil fiction right? Let’s be real
188 2018-03-03 23:31:00 Nice
189 2018-03-03 23:30:55 China is worlds largest steel exporter, by far. Steel is indeed a fungible commodity, just like oil. Few basic types priced internationally
190 2018-03-03 23:30:42 Every frame was a hand-painted oil painting in the style of Van Gogh. First film of its kind and yeah, ok, I cried.
191 2018-03-03 23:30:41 @Stormii__ where in the fudge sticks is my purple thong? And where did you hide the baby oil?
192 2018-03-03 23:30:41 I lay down on my stomach and use the opposite arm. Go to town. Get some oil.
193 2018-03-03 23:30:32 Ideologically motivated thinking. The same phenomenon that makes big oil conservatives deny climate change, fundamentalist christians deny evolution, and gender studies intersectional feminists deny population level sex differences and evolutionary psychology.
194 2018-03-03 23:30:28 So we can get rid of oil dependancy from foreign nations . Let's stop trading with Russia,  China , and Iran let them suffer life without America . They won't last . And get rid of Soros he is a very bad man
195 2018-03-03 23:29:59 Oil probably didn't want to give him term like Dallas did. Too bad the Oilers don't value signing productive wingers to long term deals at cap friendly contracts. #Chiarellied

200 2018-03-03 23:28:22 Why not? He's enriching on taxpayers expenses. Criminal crook that stole the presidency from HRC buy colluding with Putin who put him in WH to lift the sanctions and let Exon drill oil in Siberia. Putin can get Russia out of economic crisis, and Trump gets 19 billions payback.
201 2018-03-03 23:28:19 Visited a dispensary today for the first time since legalization, for my pain oil. Whoever told me that medical cardholders wouldn't have to pay tax post-legalization was wrong-- they're taxing the fuck out of this shit. So now I have a worthless $98 weed card
202 2018-03-03 23:28:05 You using the wrong ones. Just stick to coconut oil and castor oil
203 2018-03-03 23:28:00 girl coconut oil is your BEST friend, carrot oil, almond oil, Cantu leave in conditioner, & Dr.miracles gro oil
204 2018-03-03 23:27:38 do you need help  I would go buy coconut oil because the fat in the oil pulls the thc out more when you boil it on the stove
205 2018-03-03 23:27:05 No worries, fellas.

233 2018-03-03 23:21:44 I’m not. I knew day one it would happen and why. Trump will also take us to war for oil, not that any war wasn’t ever about money anyway.
234 2018-03-03 23:21:34 @TheRealKristaF has been keeping me lathered in handmade combos. But they are usually almond oil based with rose oil infusions.
235 2018-03-03 23:21:31 Oh, aren't you from Michigan?

Yep! Detroit!

But your ID says you're from Roseville.

242 2018-03-03 23:20:54 Yeah, the NDP is totally responsible for the lowest oil prices in 16 or 17 years. I just wonder what the Conservatives did with all the oil royalty money they took in. From what I can see, they pissed it all away.

246 2018-03-03 23:20:01 this is super weird, but if you’re willing to try it... I got really bad sunburn in Jamaica, so one of the workers at the resort said to use olive oil, & it honestly helped.
247 2018-03-03 23:20:00 It’s great for dogs and dogs with cancer. We just lost one in our family with cancer but he was comfortable with the CBD oil.

259 2018-03-03 23:18:02 Maybe Jared's illegal backroom deals are getting in the way of #RexTillerson's illegal backroom oil deals?
260 2018-03-03 23:17:58 I don't think that we did these things for the right reasons personally. I think there were ulterior motives involved that had NOTHING to do with oil. And what the US did, caused so many issues. It helped cause the flooding of Europe with refugees for one.

264 2018-03-03 23:17:31 Alberta is no one to hype the benefits of fossil fuels, seeing as your province is in crazy debt even after the oil companies made hay as you say. #hardlookinmirror before blaming bc for standing up for the environment.

276 2018-03-03 23:14:59 Make sure you go to a loctician that knows what they are doing. Know what size you want them to be that helps with parting. Once they start growing a spray bottle with water and tea tree oil helps with keeping them moisturized

281 2018-03-03 23:14:04 “.... the peak oil date is 2035 ....”  Anchor.
282 2018-03-03 23:13:56 Plus, both "renewable" gadgets and their processing requirements are in  no way "sustainable". I never understood why people think that adding oil reserves via human intervention is not sustainable, but replacing quickly deteriorating wind turbines via human intervention is.

285 2018-03-03 23:13:16 After all the sanctions that have hurt Russian oil production, tariffs on steel could further cause economic pain. China could start making cheap international deals, opening up their market. I’m a novice, but what is the middle & end game here?

So, this worked...

2 tsp cayenne pepper
2 tsp chili powder
1 tsp cocoa powder  

rubbed aggressively into the tenderloin (with a bit of olive oil), fried in a cast iron skillet, and paired with a big, bad dry red (like a Shiraz or Cab Sauv) is pretty amazing
356 2018-03-03 23:02:40 That's all fine and dandy except for the fact there's oil tankers all over the oceans. If you don't want Alberta oil I suggest you cut all oil and products made from oil from your life.

437 2018-03-03 22:50:12 This is a chicken and egg question. I'd maintain reserve status arose because the US wanted to live beyond its means by exporting USD (ref: oil crisis 1973/4), not that it wanted to do the world a favour by giving it a reserve currency.

447 2018-03-03 22:48:40 It has nothing to do with global capitalism. it has something to do with a dictator and massive government control, plus the collapse of oil prices which their economy depended on . They are dependent on  oil but the prices are not what they were.

451 2018-03-03 22:47:48 Oil bottomed out Jan. 2016. It has been rising for 25+ months. investment usually increases while prices rise.Trudeau and Notley elected 2015. Both addressed social justice issues, but gutted the investment climate. Fed Budget made it worse. But good point about US/Can tax spread

459 2018-03-03 22:46:42 And that in its self will lead to probs for UK if he gets in. I will be expecting fuel prices in UK to go up due to it for a start (oil). Also, borrowing will likely be more expensive also. I don’t think people realise the poss ramifications.

479 2018-03-03 22:42:20 @ANHQDC We've invaded enough countries and should leave Syria. All the oil is going to Israel refineries anyway.
480 2018-03-03 22:41:56 I hate the smell, taste, texture. It's super healthy for ppl, not animal's. I wish I liked it! Ppl tell me coconut oil has no flavor. Is that true?

487 2018-03-03 22:41:01 'your' cars are too expensive and 'your' car companies lack the ingenuity 2 make better cars. So now you'll make foreign cars more expensive which costs more
 jobs and less people driving means less buying precious fuel which hurts 'your' oil industry. U can't be this dense.

490 2018-03-03 22:40:27 Interesting.
Obviously, nausea and vomiting are pretty non-specific symptoms. 
I have no doubt a constellation of symptoms called ‘cannabis hyperemesis syndrome’ exists, associated with heavy consumption. 
If it’s heavy consumption of neem oil, we should be able to find it .

503 2018-03-03 22:37:56 So you are basically saying we should import everything including steel to keep price in check, , but ignore completely US main steam industry like steel which is back born of every country like oil
504 2018-03-03 22:37:47 Of course. Trump has stifled all mention of it among agencies where actual scientists work but that doesn't make it cease to exist. He's just a slave of big oil
505 2018-03-03 22:37:44 Those @Lamborghini oil changes are dam expensive hey?
506 2018-03-03 22:37:42 Won't this be slightly offset by the increased output from US oil production?

523 2018-03-03 22:34:21 It is actually reasonable that less oil will be shipped by rail if we had more pipelines?

Or will the pipeline just add to what we are already moving by rail?

My inclination is the latter.

533 2018-03-03 22:32:26 It seems like Particle/wave duality  should apply with it being formless, limitless, until it's observed.

Of course anything quantum is rarely intuitive. So

580 2018-03-03 22:25:12 @ResistanceFBR Very untruthful statement. We are at a great disadvantage in trade with EU. Trump is opening up oil and coal plus mining our natural resources will more than compensate our trade endeavors.

631 2018-03-03 22:16:51 We need to push for strategic gas reserves comparable to  22 days for oil products.  Relying on paying more for our gas than our neighbours at times of system stress is not a strategy in a post #Brexit world.

643 2018-03-03 22:14:59 Sure! But the collapse of the oil price was probably as big a factor, or meddling by the USA to destabilise the government, or the courts intervening to block the functioning of one of the houses in parliament. That doesn't mean it will happen here if Corbyn is PM, does it?

725 2018-03-03 22:03:05 one time i left a bottle of olive oil at maria's house so i went back to get it and i found her gently caressing the olive oil while crying
726 2018-03-03 22:03:00 Not exactly an apples to apples comparison. Alberta has 95% of Canada's proven oil reserves and more than 70% of its coal. We are a "carbon" exporter and we need to pull policy levers that don't hamstring our economic future.
727 2018-03-03 22:03:00 So if I create a car and tell you that you should change the oil but you dont change the oil and the car burns, its my responsibility your car got burnt and I suck as an engineer too? Is this your argument?
728 2018-03-03 22:02:55 Buy a beard balm if it itches. Also always rub olive oil on it if it's too thick not to get dandruff

732 2018-03-03 22:02:32 Coconut oil on your face before bed and buff it into your skin with a cotton pad before washing your face in the morning xx you’ll thank me later 
733 2018-03-03 22:02:30 Arsenal is now, a financially strong club, continue to make healthy profit without oil/china money.

Wenger played a massive part by always successfully guide Arsenal to CL, with such grim condition.

CL money was so important as PL TV rights was much lesser than now.
734 2018-03-03 22:02:28 You smell like oil, you featherless bird
735 2018-03-03 22:02:22 Offended??  What have you ever done for the USA,well maybe you sold us your oil,and sold us your aluminum,in fact you sold us a lot of things
736 2018-03-03 22:01:58 Use eye primer if you have oil skin on your nose to keep foundation from moving or sliding.
737 2018-03-03 22:01:50 PJ is scoring at a higher rate than almost any of the other wingers...besides Strome and Leon if you count him. Now that Maroon is gone. Its an embarrasment how he is being used less in favor of a player like Cammaleri who has 2 goals all season. Its inexcusable/indefenceable.
738 2018-03-03 22:01:38 So far, #BBNajia has taught some of us to always be cautious of our attitude everytime. It has taught us to learn to tolerate our neighbors, irrespective of their tribe. Want more?
739 2018-03-03 22:01:35 I always use a Q-tip with a little bit of coconut oil to fix my winged eyeliner mistakes
740 2018-03-03 22:01:15 Yes - because of the coal strike, with an oil crisis following on. British coal was expensive to mine, and the industry was bound to fail. That’s part of the economic reality the left misses.
741 2018-03-03 22:01:12 I think you are smoking too much crack! When the oil price drops why does the fuel price stay the same until a few months later?  Do you really want me tot go on?  please take your #faknews elsewhere 
742 2018-03-03 22:00:56 And it is LEGAL in Australia, lets be clear on that. The ban on e-cigarettes is purely relavant to nicotine based products. You can go out today, buy a vape and nicotine-free oil and vape your heart out. Your campaign to legalise nicotine based vaping is not very honest.
743 2018-03-03 22:00:49 I say this at least weekly. I blame the oil companies! 
744 2018-03-03 22:00:45 *puts Moroccan oil in my dogs hair to make him feel pretty*

746 2018-03-03 22:00:38 Folate rich foods are dark leafy greens, nuts, seeds & lentils. Superfoods to support hormonal balance are Maca, goji berries & coconut oil.
747 2018-03-03 22:00:33 RT @LivingSafely: Big #Mac this March? The first three #ingredients in the Special Sauce are oil, pickles, High Fructose Corn Syrup.
748 2018-03-03 22:00:33 Getting an oil change done because I can't do it myself right now. I'm pretty sure they are getting the oil from the middle East directly at this rate....
749 2018-03-03 22:00:29 おーっす！はよー！今日も頑張ろーぜ！
750 2018-03-03 22:00:29 Like Angola, all the oil wealth is concentrated at the top...
751 2018-03-03 22:00:25 In 112 hours, the Sun provides as much energy as is contained in all proven reserves of coal, oil, and natural gas. #SolarFacts
752 2018-03-03 22:00:11 Go to charlottes web. Com a lot of people in our vets office use CBD oil for their pets and swear by it
753 2018-03-03 22:00:10 I'm not in the mood to change my oil today, like I just painted my nails  I'm sure my car can make it another week.
754 2018-03-03 22:00:06 March 03, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
755 2018-03-03 22:00:06 Changing a rotor and tips is a nightmare I’ve dun one would need doing every few months special drivers not changing oil regularly
756 2018-03-03 22:00:01 Millenials are killing the oil industry
757 2018-03-03 21:59:47 i love the smell of coconut oil in my hair 
758 2018-03-03 21:59:41 such a bummer that 3-in-1 oil cannot be purchased in a tin dropper these days. probably gonna die mad about this
759 2018-03-03 21:59:36 Truth, like oil, always comes to the surface
760 2018-03-03 21:59:32 I recently got one of those 2 inch fossa angled and its real quality. I been using it in alot of oil to do door jambs. I think ill get another.
761 2018-03-03 21:59:16 The amount of people I saw today on my drive back from my oil change without their taillights on is frightening. If you have to stop abruptly for whatever reason, and I can’t see the back of your vehicle because your taillights weren’t on, I am going to have a couple words for ya
762 2018-03-03 21:59:16 Quitting cold turkey is hard - try to sub it out with healthier 'taters.  Roasted garlic, olive oil, and herb potatoes, silky mashed potatoes, scalloped potatoes, twice baked potatoes - can you tell I have Irish blood in me, LOL??  Never met a potato I didn't like!
763 2018-03-03 21:58:56 Next week the house will take up a bill to stop government funded oil painting.

Nothing on #GunControl scheduled.
764 2018-03-03 21:58:15 I’ve worked hard to get to a point in my life where I can pay someone to change my oil. I do realize there may be a need for me to change a tire myself.
765 2018-03-03 21:58:06 Who do you blame?
USA, CIA, Venezuelan Opposition, Students?
Why is so hard to put the blame where it belongs? Who controlled 100% of oil revenue, controlled the Judicial, Legistave, Executive and military powers in Venezuela?
Those are the ones to blame! Chavez Regime anyone?
766 2018-03-03 21:57:59  RT @DillanXO: Shorties get butt naked to get a back massage but wonder why our face between they ass cheeks soon as all the oil rubbed on
767 2018-03-03 21:57:09 Didn’t oil the sticks. Didn’t put butter sauce on them. Didn’t put stick seasoning on them. And no marinara sauce. Disappointed
768 2018-03-03 21:56:57 I used to think aromatherapy was whack but this lemongrass essential oil has me CHARGED UP
769 2018-03-03 21:56:52 Hmmm, God bless the mechanic wey dey service you o. Hope say hin  dey oil your engine well?

771 2018-03-03 21:56:40 Bitches grow out of their hormonal acne and really think their St. Ives apricot scrub and direct application of tea tree oil did that.
772 2018-03-03 21:56:38 How refreshing that the major sponsor of the South African cricket appears to be a manufacturer of vegetable oil.
773 2018-03-03 21:56:34 Anyone got the hookup on an essential oil that will help me stop crying when I listen to Halsey songs?
774 2018-03-03 21:56:20 He did have choice. He chose not to use Slep and PJ in feature roles. They have succeded more than others too boot which makes blaming him entirely fair. If he used them and they failed thats one thing. But he didnt beforem They have been productive when he has.
775 2018-03-03 21:56:11 argan oil saves lives x
776 2018-03-03 21:56:07 Rosemary oil is acc life
777 2018-03-03 21:56:04 Unfractured a documentary at BUSC on the fight in NY state to stop fracking for natural gas around Seneca Lake and other places in NY was excellent.  A very small group of people managed to stop Big Oil in its tracks.
778 2018-03-03 21:55:23 Got the oil changed + maintenance done on my car today so I can go back to doing all the drivings
779 2018-03-03 21:55:22 Bad policy - even ignoring environmental costs, Canadian oil is expensive and EVs are going to take a sledgehammer to oil prices. Diversify Alberta's economy ASAP! #ElectricVehiclesAreComing #SCurve
780 2018-03-03 21:55:14 You wanna come home to some nice food and a clean house.

Not a house that smells like masala and food drenched in oil.
781 2018-03-03 21:54:30 There are no opportunities here for the masses. The real masses, not the oil well and Governors sons and daughters masses.

And we better not blame our government for Anything. We stay voting people who talk too much. Forgetting that empty vessels makes the most noise.
782 2018-03-03 21:54:15 What does it matter if there were wells there first. I live in Huntington Beach and it was covered with oil wells, does not mean that in todays environment we want more.  They're toxic and cause harm to us and our kids.
783 2018-03-03 21:54:14 New brakes and routers and oil change. 
784 2018-03-03 21:53:58 You already rely on other nations just to provide you with the food to feed your population.  You also rely on oil, oil products etc.  You can't produce enough of a lot of goods to provide for your nation.  This is why trade agreements work, and why trade wars will hurt yoj
785 2018-03-03 21:53:54 If avocado oil is good for your hair, if a piece of avocado falls out of your sandwich and into your hair is that still a good thing? #AskingForAFriend
786 2018-03-03 21:53:45 Maelstrom: Day-glo vikings, random trolls, an overly tall polar bear, and an oil rig cuz reasons.
787 2018-03-03 21:53:40 On January 1st 2008 our Bolivar (Bs.) currency became the new currency called Bolivar Fuerte (BsF.) in a magic trick where 1,000.oo Bs. turned into 1 BsF.

And remember Chavez and oil prices where at their peak
788 2018-03-03 21:53:38 Organic coconut oil is one of the best natural moisturizers for the skin. If you can't eat it, you shouldn't be putting it on your skin! :)
789 2018-03-03 21:53:19 Depends on your perception tho. What is useful to me might be useless and worthless to you.
790 2018-03-03 21:53:18 Oil . But what do you say when I tell you ...they forgot to fill tank so we were out of heating for 24 hours. It was so cold inside...I went crazy. Called owner.all 4 app were cold and no hot water.

795 2018-03-03 21:51:17 I just started thinking about using cbd oil for my old loaf.  This thread has provided awesome help.
796 2018-03-03 21:51:05 Hi @jamieoliver . Love watching your shows on Good Food channel. Just a bit concerned about the amount of ads for vagisan!!!! Surely a little olive oil would do the trick?????

801 2018-03-03 21:50:27 Same happened to me waiting for an oil change.....I guess negative publicity is better than none.....the Communist News Network has perfected it for Trump!!!!!
802 2018-03-03 21:50:20 Whale oil beef hooked
803 2018-03-03 21:50:15 If you did some actual research, it is the term used by leaders and activists to unilaterally refer to polluting oil companies.
804 2018-03-03 21:49:52 Is it you Corvin or her with the tan, trunks & baby oil?

809 2018-03-03 21:48:07 What's missing in video is the real cause of the #FailedState-not a drop in oil prices (is this happening in other OPEC nations? NO!) Sanctions? (Only the named individuals in regime are sanctioned since they've robbed the country blind) Real reason? #Socialism leads to #Tyranny
810 2018-03-03 21:48:05 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
811 2018-03-03 21:48:02 You shouldn't brag about doing dumb things. Also, only 12-year-old bedwetters actually use the phrase 'Big Oil.'
812 2018-03-03 21:48:02 Hold on, we live together nigga give me my chili oil first or I’ll never vacuum the stairs again.

814 2018-03-03 21:47:45 Idk if it’s on Netflix but it’s a very popular documentary. I watched it in hs in my AP Enviro Sci class and it made me so mad. Basically GM put out this perfect electric car, then recalled all of them and destroyed them because they were bribed by big oil
815 2018-03-03 21:47:30 Thanks for pointing out that you don't need other Countries. We will keep our quality steel, nickel and aluminum products, our oil, clean water and hydroelectric power. Let's see where that gets you.
816 2018-03-03 21:47:30 Keylor navas and clean sheet are like oil and water.

837 2018-03-03 21:44:09 My hands  hurt a little because I was rough housing with Shiro (I just wanted to pet him, but no, if my hands move it means play time for him and ouch time for me). I miss when he was a baby and had tiny claws. Now I'm treating myself with some coconut oil and essential oils.
838 2018-03-03 21:43:52 I want a self portrait made with oil paint one day insha Allah.... something that can be passed down my legacy
839 2018-03-03 21:43:46 #OTD in 1938, an American-owned oil well in Saudi Arabia drilled into what would soon be identified as the world’s largest source of petroleum. Today, Saudi Arabia has 16% of the world's proved oil reserves and is home to the largest onshore and offshore fields in the world.

I feel like I must be half way through, light at end of the tunnel

850 2018-03-03 21:42:49 "However, building new energy infrastructure in New England is difficult...", There used to be an expression in Texas about Letting the Yankees freeze in the dark-seems they are now doing it to themselves...now more oil and gas available in our history and NE wont use it--amazing
851 2018-03-03 21:42:47 One thing I do is at low heat saute garlic in olive oil (don't let it brow much, even) and then get rid of the garlic and add the oil. Much more subtle.

857 2018-03-03 21:41:58 only rule for me is to not use regular body wash for my back, need shower oil, because of that PH, or something along those lines.
858 2018-03-03 21:41:51 God damnit man say Alberta not Canada. 
Just stand for Alberta for once. The oil doesn't belong to the east as much as they think it is

864 2018-03-03 21:41:21 Thank Goodness  That's why our @NYCMayor DeBlasio won Re-election by a Landslide. Trump can lie all he wants, but we all know that coal and oil are pollution not energy. The future of our city, our country lies in Clean Energy and our health depends on it. #FightClimateChange

868 2018-03-03 21:40:55 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

875 2018-03-03 21:39:48 Norway is oil rich. Hence social programs for 4 M people. Even Norway would not be able to support social programs for 300 M people. Their taxes are over 60%. The other countries you list have their own issues. I would not live anywhere but in the US, although European myself.

880 2018-03-03 21:39:26 I am capitalism and my anatomy is the anatomy of a monster, I breathe fire, I consume oil, I tinker with your pretty brains.
881 2018-03-03 21:38:56 Exactly. I had just changed it but didn't have time for anything else, so we went Name Brand to save time. Ha! That was the longest oil change I've ever experienced.
882 2018-03-03 21:38:52 Oil have been on fire in 1st p scoring machines. Then they blow it in 2nd and 3rd
883 2018-03-03 21:38:51 That’s exactly it. Zero reforms done anywhere. If oil goes to $100 today it will be worse than anything under GEJ
884 2018-03-03 21:38:45 almost the same for our fire...hardly gone out. electric boiler the way forward, no oil tank etc etc.
885 2018-03-03 21:38:22 Cool. I was set on high protein loads of olive oil eggs fish dairy, fry ups etc. Little realising it was setting me up for later disease like most people. I had no clue only plants make protein. And no idea plants literally reverse heart dosease & diabetes. I m still amazed.
886 2018-03-03 21:38:19 UK, EU, USA, The World, not interested. No OIL.

889 2018-03-03 21:38:02 Shit nasty no matter what you mix it with, it taste like oil.
890 2018-03-03 21:37:58 Natural Beauty Tip for Beautiful Eyes:-

Apply to the affected area and gently massage for 3 – 4 minutes.

895 2018-03-03 21:37:09 New report shows that the violent Marxist thugs of @NoDAPL colluded with Russian agents.
Why?

896 2018-03-03 21:37:08 Tbh I’ve been using the Benonite clay for masks like once a week and I made my own toner with Chamomile and witch Hazel. Then I made my own moisturizer with cocoa butter, coconut oil, vitamin E oil and some lavender EO. I wanted to make my own so I knew what was in them
897 2018-03-03 21:36:34 I have a pair of boots that I’ve cleaned and oil countless times over the decade+ I’ve owned them. It’s one of my favorites as well, nothing beats a clean and well oiled boot. In our throw away culture its a nice change to care for something and make it last.

909 2018-03-03 21:35:19 This situation calls for three barrels of crude oil, a bow tie and a goofy smile.
910 2018-03-03 21:35:08 Lol, good luck, I had a 9:00 appointment at NTB to get my work car serviced, didn’t get checked in till 9:30 and they called me at 1:00 to say the car was ready...that was just for oil change, tire rotation and balance.
911 2018-03-03 21:35:04 So for a real world example of the type of process I'm talking about, you could look at The Cullen Inquiry which was held to look into the events that lead to the Piper Alpha oil rig disaster in the North Sea.

Something like this should have been done after Sandy Hook frankly.

918 2018-03-03 21:34:05 yes. and I am not sure Russia will love it truely. the only price hike Russia really loves is oil/gas price hike.
919 2018-03-03 21:34:00 I hope it WAS ABOUR oil and gas.  We need oil and gas a lot more than a bunch of remote desert scrubland nobody visits.
920 2018-03-03 21:33:58 I can't get over the oil - it's gross.  Butter in my coffee is nice though!
921 2018-03-03 21:33:58 Plant trees now. Coal and oil won’t be enough to keep us warm. All will need wood to burn. Plant now!

925 2018-03-03 21:33:26 New report @stopKXL colluded with Russian agents.
Why?
To raise oil prices to help the Russian economy.
926 2018-03-03 21:32:41 If you were my patient, I would ask about past surgeries, specialists you’ve seen, whether it’s structural, wear, acute, or chronic, and your official diagnosis before deciding a course of treatment. 
But no. kneeling on it doesn’t work. 
The “expert” can FOH with her snake oil.
927 2018-03-03 21:32:35 When saddam gassed them Turkey hosted them..This operation is not againist kurds at all againist pkk pyd terrorists who also occupied syrian soil ,gas and oil fields without any fare ground.

929 2018-03-03 21:32:15 We need to push for strategic gas reserves comparable to  22 days for oil products.  Relying on paying more for our gas than our neighbours is not a strategy in a post #Brexit world.  @beisgovuk @nationalgriduk

932 2018-03-03 21:31:09 Natural Beauty Tip for Beautiful Eyes:-

936 2018-03-03 21:30:23 Conflicted but Ive more than once thought she was a bit naive in regards to some of the expensive skincare/makeup products and how effective they really are. She falls for snake oil like products, so I'm not surprised she was pitched all the ingredients for it and was like "Yes!"
937 2018-03-03 21:30:17 おはよう。二度寝したら追いオリーブだぞ。
938 2018-03-03 21:29:52  Oil will be here shortly !

948 2018-03-03 21:27:58 Ok so this is wrong.  Your pet can OD on CBD oil with THC.  You should only be using hemp derived CBD oil on pets.
949 2018-03-03 21:27:56 hearing since 2016 about Russian oil and Moscow pee video. Why taking so long to confirm and act on what we’ve known all along @gop

954 2018-03-03 21:26:44 Venezuela was a shining example of capitalism and democracy in action in South America. Along comes a dictator who nationalised industry, shut down political opponents, instituted socialism and used the country's oil profits to flame resistance groups in other countries.

957 2018-03-03 21:26:11 Thought was storage when ROC Oil used it? Did both production and storage approx 2004? Then sold to wingas who had to sell
958 2018-03-03 21:26:09 *blush* Same here… the new snow was fun but it turned horrid before we’d had time to enjoy it.  I get my paws buttered too & yesterday I had them dunked in Grapenut Oil.
959 2018-03-03 21:26:09 Feel like I just won the lottery. Brought my car in for an oil change and they WASHED IT TOO. Who needs a man 
960 2018-03-03 21:26:04 The trick is to keep things simple. So, pick out two green paints - one slightly lighter than the other. Paint the flesh with the dark green, then shade/wash all over with a black shade ie. Nuln oil, or something similar. Are you using GW paints?
961 2018-03-03 21:26:00 #Skincare Ingredient Tip: A macerated/ infused oil describes an oil that has been infused with a chosen medicinal or fragrant plant.
962 2018-03-03 21:25:36 Georgia gave all businesses a tax break. Delta wanted an additional SPECIAL tax break. No tax on fuel oil. THIS is the tax break Georgia decided not to give them.
963 2018-03-03 21:25:28 Not bad for empty oil & gas fields, eh?
964 2018-03-03 21:24:50 Getting my oil changed by myself for the first time made me realize I’m not an adult and I’m failing at life lmao. Who am I.
965 2018-03-03 21:24:33 I put mint in my oil burner and now I feel weird
966 2018-03-03 21:24:23 Quick shake out on the balcony for 2 mins, olive oil sheen and it fresh again

970 2018-03-03 21:23:54 I think he was saying same thing about Japan that he said about Iraq. We invaded them & have military presence, why not take oil fields?...
971 2018-03-03 21:23:45 What happens when you don't, LET THE WORLD BANK AND OIL COMPANIES HAVE ALL YOUR OIL FOR THIER GAMES...
972 2018-03-03 21:23:44 Ooo my baby sound nice with that new oil boyyyy hahaha hear me say it thought
973 2018-03-03 21:23:34 Might be the first time I vote for a party other than the PCs.  Enough is enough, since when did conservatism mean pissing all over progress, science and people?  I want the oil industry to succeed as much as the next but this is plain messed up.

978 2018-03-03 21:22:53 Continually impressed at the relief the CBD oil is giving me. Will buy stronger MG next time. Woke up @ 5:30 AM, w/MEGA lower back pain. Used 3 drops. No pain when I awoke later. UNBELIEVABLE!!!!! 
979 2018-03-03 21:22:38 No amount of castor oil can fix that mess, beloved
980 2018-03-03 21:22:33 Coconut oil? Yes, it’s greasy but great healing qualities (or so I’m told as I’m slathering it on a recent scar!)
981 2018-03-03 21:22:06 Natural Beauty Tip for Beautiful Eyes:- 

Apply a small amount of almond oil to the affected area and gently massage for 3 – 4 minutes. 

Leave overnight and rinse with water the next morning.

Repeat daily until results are visible.

1009 2018-03-03 21:17:52 @FiveGuysUK just noticed ‘we cook our fries only in peanut oil’. What about customers who have a life threatening peanut allergy?  Will not be popping along as a consequence tomorrow...
1010 2018-03-03 21:17:52 Lol nah they just said oil change to get my wheels rotated
1011 2018-03-03 21:17:36 Someone has an oil leak

1013 2018-03-03 21:17:14 Kay drags out Ian Plimer like so many, but can't take the time to find out he has been a director of Ivanhoe Australia, CBH Resources, Kefi Minerals, Silver City Minerals, Ormil Energy Ltd, TNT Mines, Niuminco Group and Lakes Oil. All mining companies. He is not impartial at all.
1014 2018-03-03 21:17:02 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
1015 2018-03-03 21:16:59 I was living in Sask at the time. I knew that night that politics in #ableg had drastically changed - mostly for the good. 

I believe that years of labour immigration caused by successive oil booms has drastically changed Alberta demographics away from RW politics of #UCP.

1018 2018-03-03 21:16:42 Went to get an oil change and ended up also getting my tires rotated, so I have done MORE than enough today
1019 2018-03-03 21:16:39 Thanks, Haneefah.
 I have all that in it plus aloe Vera, rose water, imi ojo, eyin aro, coconut water, cinnamon, coffee, spa salt, shea butter, drops of tea tree/peppermint oil, camwood. But my skin still hasn't banged 
1020 2018-03-03 21:16:28 Nice head swing Oil!

1022 2018-03-03 21:16:10 Also carrot seed oil.
1023 2018-03-03 21:16:01 The upshot of my picky as fuck Virgo rising (everything has to be perfect)/Libra sun (and Aesthetic ™)/Aquarius moon (and weird and unique) is that I am very diy. This weekend’s project is a perfume oil that smells like an Ethiopian restaurant.
1024 2018-03-03 21:15:52 William Wallace is 7 foot tall! You sure you don’t need me to come round and oil your hinges ?!
1025 2018-03-03 21:15:46 Hot oil treatment, massage your head
1026 2018-03-03 21:15:40 @realDonaldTrump mixes with Russians like oil and water. I think we taxpayers need to demand that Mueller should start thinking on how to pay back the millions he fleeced American for.
1027 2018-03-03 21:15:38 No very little subsidy and usually for decommissioning oil rigs
1028 2018-03-03 21:15:15 There isn’t anything quite like Rem oil on a brand new bolt carrier group.
1029 2018-03-03 21:15:01 @UtahGOP @UtahDemocrats @UtahWomenDems So says one of the most corrupt Senators @OrrinHatch @senorrinhatch in Utah history. Now he's allowing Bears Ears to be distroyed for oil & gas exploration.

1035 2018-03-03 21:14:31 For aftercare, try using a massage oil
1036 2018-03-03 21:14:14 Why they never check how many garbage collectors or ppl who lay hydro cables, work in oil sands, or in fishing are women?
1037 2018-03-03 21:14:09 Lift up your bottle of oil now as I pray.

“Let Your anointing on me go into the bottles lifted to You all over the world, let it saturate them.

Let wonders happen wherever it will be used in Jesus' name.”

1043 2018-03-03 21:12:45 BRUH it took me 5 stores to find 100% organic Jojoba oil and the mf is only 1oz and cost me $7, they do this every time it get hot but I bet I rack up next winter so I don’t have to search around  buttt thank goodness it’s coconut oil season after this round of Jojoba oil 
1044 2018-03-03 21:12:24 Aren’t you supposed to cover that with #kale or sautéed #hemp - wilted #stingnettles salad sprinkled with virgin crush juniper oil that is only found on the far side of some sacred hill, Cheech & Chong know about?
1045 2018-03-03 21:12:19 Your speaking in circles. Is amusing how some Canadians think our oil should come from somewhere else. Saudi Arabia executes people on the street. Nigeria has oil leaking onto the ground everywhere. The USA environmental laws are not nearly as stringent as Canadian law. Smh
1046 2018-03-03 21:12:04 Give me oil in my lamp, keep me burning. Give me oil in my lamp I pray. Give me oil in my lamp, Keep me burning till the glorious day
1047 2018-03-03 21:11:49 Carbs and fats together are no good for your body. Keto isn’t about fried foods and things like cream cheese should be minimally used. Your body runs on fats, but obviously healthy fats like coconut oil, fats from dark meats, and from veggies like avocado is the main power source

1065 2018-03-03 21:09:04 Another ruse to divert.  The guns are the rattle, but the snake is oil.  Where is Tillerson, Zinke, Perry?  They left their beast here according to the weather.
1066 2018-03-03 21:08:38 I know that. Skin dries out like paper. Feels like breaking up. Shall I send you some really good ointment? Natural cammomille with cod liver oil, green medicine. And  non-detergent soap. Don't take chemical creams or normal soap. Makes it worse.
1067 2018-03-03 21:08:15 The sugar-free stuff that's not pretending to be the actual thing that's paid for by the oil industry big wigs.

1071 2018-03-03 21:07:00 You're pissed off at Canada, so go ahead, punish us with ur tariffs. We will put tariffs on the electricity YOU buy from us. & the oil etc.U may think ur being ripped off, but u aren't.Ur the type who is never satisfied. Every complaint u file with the WTO against Canada, U LOSE.
1072 2018-03-03 21:06:59 the deadliest slip and slide has been created with over 50 bottles of dish wash and oil which will be the battleground for today's match
1073 2018-03-03 21:06:57 need to buy castor oil for my hairline because wow.
1074 2018-03-03 21:06:49 why is it that I have no problem at all spending $90+ on a night out on alcohol/uber but when it comes to buying groceries or an oil change i have an internal war with myself
1075 2018-03-03 21:06:48 We get slapped with tariffs almost everywhere and we keep sending goods. Why not the same the other way around? And you’re forgetting our military. We can’t be dependent on steel as much as we can’t with oil.
1076 2018-03-03 21:06:39 Sex, walking, spicy foods, Jamaican black castor oil(use it carefully it can cause diarrhea)

1086 2018-03-03 21:04:32 Off the oil trying to make beats on this beautiful sat afternoon
1087 2018-03-03 21:04:20 Yeah it would be much better to rape the land in Saudi Arabia where the proceeds from the oil sales will go to funding the spread of terrorism. Fuck those American jobs, stupid ass blue collar workers trying to earn a living on a drilling rig. Fuck their kids and families too.
1088 2018-03-03 21:04:10 just seasoned with Paprika and chilli flakes. grilled in butter and olive oil, added coriander and at the end I added Sriracha whilst grillin
1089 2018-03-03 21:04:07 The oil conspiracy theory is as much of a lie as Iraq having active WMDs. There's no doubt Islamic terrorism existed in the Middle East, not in China, NK, or Eritrea. If motive is oil we'd be in Venezuela right now, no?

1103 2018-03-03 21:02:26 I know CBD oil has helped me immensely with cutting down my own opioid use (not being sarcastic). Pot needs to be 100 percent legal federally. And I say that as someone who is allergic to THC  (though thankfully not CBD)
1104 2018-03-03 21:02:22 Getting my oil changed and the guy told me my total and I said I had a coupon, and the girl in the waiting area with me was like “if you hadn’t had a coupon, I was gonna be like girl I got you!” Thankful there are still some good people in the world

1113 2018-03-03 21:01:13 Oh and just one other thing. I see you like fires. You will have to stop relying on using wood as a firesource as well because oil & gas is used to process wood, and it also releases CO2 into the air. So unless you can wield an axe..UR screwed 
1114 2018-03-03 21:01:07 Swish coconut oil. About a teaspoon or more, whatever you can handle for at least a minute. Then spit out onto paper. Not your sink because you'll end up blocking the pipes. Research oil pulling. Bonus teeth whitening.
1115 2018-03-03 21:00:57 Really need a Tesla, fuck waiting for oil changes lol
1116 2018-03-03 21:00:25 I NEED an essential oil diffuser!
1117 2018-03-03 21:00:21 Well I only oil pull in an effort to achieve optimal oral health. Brushing my teeth alone doesn’t give my mouth the super clean feeling that oil pulling does. It literally pulls the bacteria that “teeth brushing“ cannot. It has also whitened my teeth naturally over the years!
1118 2018-03-03 21:00:12 Petroleum, or crude oil, forms when tiny little sea animals and plants die and then get mixed up with sand and slit on the sea floors.

1124 2018-03-03 20:58:53 ‘You chose to live there’ hahaha we’ll leave it there then. All the oil in the world wouldn’t unfreeze the pipes. Each to their own, but a little empathy never goes amiss.

1131 2018-03-03 20:58:32 Yeah the ones screaming the loudest don’t use oil; nope! They don’t drive cars, don’t heat and cool their homes, don’t use public transportation. Amazing ‘green’ people.

1136 2018-03-03 20:57:52 Come through granny with the holy oil 
1137 2018-03-03 20:57:48 Very true. I guess taking a 3 year deal leads me to believe it was more about that opportunity than a lack of one from the Oilers. Oil really stood by that guy during tough times.
1138 2018-03-03 20:57:44 And the house of prostitute are drunk on oil money but the world doesn't remain the same if it tg takes 100s of years we they will have to answer for their cowardly ways..
1139 2018-03-03 20:57:37 what has it done for you? i guess its diff for diff ppl! but my mom saw a testimony of a lady who had scurvy or something like that & she had oil pulled for yeaaars & it did nothing. her dr said try wheatgrass & it worked. her teeth were loose & now they’re strong etc.
1140 2018-03-03 20:57:05 They live on oil. When oil is not enough for their living, the bomb explode
1141 2018-03-03 20:57:02 We import $2.361 trillion worth of automobiles, oil, and cell phones - from China and Korea. We will nuke them!!
1142 2018-03-03 20:56:59 If the oil sands were located in Quebec, there would be more oil flowing out of Canada than the shit Montreal dumps in the St.Lawrence.
1143 2018-03-03 20:56:53 It's normal from a zionist thief...they stole Arabs  and oil and kill them...the coming days will reveal alot of things

They are liars, con men.

1152 2018-03-03 20:56:12 I did some investigating on Google. Over here, everything is so spread apart, we need to drive. Most people that deliver food have to use their own car, so that means upkeep on oil changes, tires, various maintenance. We get at lest minimum wage, but it's about the convenience.
1153 2018-03-03 20:55:57 Oil price explains much? We had econ growth, esp in central Can. We had lower Corp taxes than USA for time of decline since 2015 I thought

Apply almond oil under the eyes several times a day.

Almond oil is rich in Vitamin E, a nourishing vitamin for skin.

1169 2018-03-03 20:53:33 Today has been the most productive I have been on a weekend. Whole house cleaned, took my car get an oil change, and went to the gym. I feel so good 
1170 2018-03-03 20:53:27 Yes yes yes, gratitude is oil on the axle of life!!!!
1171 2018-03-03 20:53:27 Wheatgrass  That’s new to me. But very interesting b/c I enjoy exposure to new concepts. I’ve been oil pulling w/ organic coconut oil for 5 years. Love the results so I can’t see myself doing anything different!
1172 2018-03-03 20:53:21 Why I always carry olive oil with me 
1173 2018-03-03 20:53:20 Draisaitl and McD don’t have to change their overall games to play w/ Lucic? Yup they do cause he doesn’t have the hand or foot speed let alone does he think the game the way they do. Is he not a fighter? Protector so to speak? Wonder what Benny thinks of that.

1175 2018-03-03 20:53:14 Where can I get an oil change rn
1176 2018-03-03 20:53:07 Isis didn’t exist at the time of Iraq war. For the most US politicians and audience, considering the reasonable retaliation sentiment for 9/11, if you’re brown, Arabic speaker and sitting on huge oil reserves you deserve a nice and tough lesson.
1177 2018-03-03 20:52:59 Getting that oil change my car feels like I just bought it...so smooth.
1178 2018-03-03 20:52:57 Obviously just a pure coincidence that a company looking to steal oil from the occupied Golan has such a well connected board... Just coincidental that the chaos instigated in Syria by their friends helps reduce opposition to them.
1179 2018-03-03 20:52:40 PLEASE read ingredient labels on everything you buy. Palm oil has many names. Anything with word palm, but others too.Often listed as ‘vegetable oil’. Virtually ALL soaps,and don’t believe the’ sustainable’label either. We MUST save orangutans.time running out
1180 2018-03-03 20:52:23 You and Bill go way back with the Russian’s when your husband was President due to oil... It’s documented.
1181 2018-03-03 20:52:23 My guess, the oil gummed up in the freezing temps.
1182 2018-03-03 20:52:17 Oooh I have to get an oil change soon :/
1183 2018-03-03 20:52:14 The LORD will reply to them: 'I am sending you grain, new wine and oil, enough to satisfy you fully; never again will I make you an object of scorn to the nations.

1184 2018-03-03 20:51:54 You are nailing it! I've always been a BIG #Lucic fan!!! And still like him as a 3rd or 4th liner. But yes #Chiarelli was out of him mind when he signed #Lucic to this contract. Will handcuff #Oilers for 5 yrs.
1185 2018-03-03 20:51:46 I raised my oil brother and sister and have been a parent figure ever since then. They even say I hour more than my mom and dad combined together. 
1186 2018-03-03 20:51:35 you can easily emulsify water and oil into a single substance but first, you have to whip the oil (D+R=Oil)

1190 2018-03-03 20:50:27 You should try the scrambled eggs with some Lee Kum Kee Chilli oil, it's surprisingly good!
Other than that, sounds like a chill day! :)
1191 2018-03-03 20:50:21 Not to be dramatic but the Sunday Riley ufo oil is the best thing I’ve ever purchased in my entire life
1192 2018-03-03 20:50:12 Next time, please keep Congress informed in order to make wise choices on tariffs (CLEAN ENERGY and Solar Panel tariffs are not wise tariffs) and inform these people in order to not sink the DOW....And that means you don't inform DIRTY OIL buddies or Carl Icahn.
1193 2018-03-03 20:49:57 Most soybeans go to feed, oil additives, plastics.  Unless you eat it on purpose or by cheap meat with fillers, don't screw up trade with that soy boy crap.
1194 2018-03-03 20:49:41 That is true, but the fact remains that other countries can produce what we do. Our competition will be greater if our crops are more expensive due to tariffs. Hell, even what WE consume of our crops, oil, machinery and everything else will be more expensive for us!

1198 2018-03-03 20:49:17 see i tried coconut oil & i felt like it did nothing besides reduce build up. I’m trying wheatgrass now. i just started it today. has the oil pulling helped you at all?
1199 2018-03-03 20:49:12 Indeed.. though it was Bahrain that started producing oil in 1932... I think first in Middle East..

1201 2018-03-03 20:48:59 I’m sorry but Lucic is NOT a line 1 LW-PERIOD!! His contract was dumb right from the get go. At the time he signed that contract the wear and tear being the type of player he is who in their right mind would pay that? He is NOT doing anything near what he was brought here for

1226 2018-03-03 20:43:55 What do u want him to do?   Trump economically tougher on Russia than obama who sold out Poland, slow walked aid to Ukraine and did zero when they invaded Crimea.  Trump stepping up prod of gas/oil which is hurting them economically.  Suddenly Dems want sanctions

1236 2018-03-03 20:42:25 And that is where I sit. I'd much rather see McLellan go and Chiarelli at least have a little more time to develop a pool of prospect depth, but he does hold responsibility for the existing roster too, so if theu both go I won't shed tears.

1242 2018-03-03 20:41:42 Understand. However, you can't grow any sector without first creating demand. I mean no investor will put money in a sector that is saturated. Must create d need/market to pull in investors & essentially create jobs for our people. Recall, then had limited FX due to low oil price

1246 2018-03-03 20:40:51 I read up about golden paste- turmeric mixed with water over slow heat and then coconut oil and a dash of pepper. Supposedly good for the heart slows down the enlarging that happens with age. Think it’s helping my doggie.
1247 2018-03-03 20:40:50 My favorite part of #ExxonKnew is that this oil pr group is  the only account I've ever seen tweeting about it. It's like bursting into the police station and announcing defensively that you haven't committed a murder

1254 2018-03-03 20:39:45 BH this week says 299 in Canada 3 offshore. USA is 981 (481 in Texas) 18 of which are offshore. So With 1 tenth of the population, Canada has 1/3 of the North American rig count working. In 2014 Alberta was 500 active rigs plus all winter. That’s a lot of “not oil sands” oil.

1258 2018-03-03 20:38:59 yes like an oil shock -- that caused lower demand while oil exporting countries were trying to figure out what to do with the money.  Both cause stagflation.

1265 2018-03-03 20:37:57 Are you in the USA? We don't have wars for that reason. War is about money and power for people at the top. I love my country, and I don't want my children to fight oil wars. 
1266 2018-03-03 20:37:47 It makes sense if you look at it strictly on a shallow basis as an accounting identity & assume no velocity of money.  However, the US' experience w the shale oil & gas sector (US imports of oil/gas collapse, US econ benefit hugely +) is a very big indictment of this shallow view
1267 2018-03-03 20:37:18 Don't you use gas and oil yourself, maybe even coal?

1278 2018-03-03 20:35:50 Nuclear energy is actually cheaper in the long run, it’s just the initial startup/building costs that are large.

My guess is, they want to reserve more of their oil for export, and they are going to see what they can do with solar power.

1282 2018-03-03 20:34:50 We've got a good support group here @Beaglepapa71 let it all out. Express your frustration, you're among twitter friends and we will not turn on you in an instant if we dont see eye to eye with you. I always say Oilers twitter is the most rational group of people i know.
1283 2018-03-03 20:34:47 Again, these things aren't like in the movies where one side is all good or bad. Russia sold oil to Hitler for the same reason the Iraqis sold it on the market to us, even though it was clear the US would invade. Twice.
1284 2018-03-03 20:34:29 Sorry to say that Sam... but Iraq was full of non cooperative brown people sitting literally on a gigantic oil barrel
1285 2018-03-03 20:34:21 The #Chiarelli hire was like turning a hungry goat into your garden. His history showed that he would squander our hard-earned talent. And #McLellan is a coach that could never quite get his team over the hump. #Oilers Both are proving it again.
1286 2018-03-03 20:34:13 take your lashes off nightly. use castor oil to help grow your natural lashes & get a dope mascara. use tape or sew down to secure your frontal. live better.
1287 2018-03-03 20:34:13 I have great confidence that China is allowing oil to go to D.
1288 2018-03-03 20:33:56 Because that oil belong to Persian not to zionists.
1289 2018-03-03 20:33:43 Don't know what's matter with me lately, my hormones are all over place I just cry over bloody game show the one with Ginger Spice hosting   I better start taking evening primrose oil tablets again.  #NotFeelingGood
1290 2018-03-03 20:33:34 I am working on an essay for my own creative practice today so shout out to all of us burning the weekend career oil.

1292 2018-03-03 20:33:30 I believe Jason is talking about oil and gas jobs, the heart of AB's economy.
1293 2018-03-03 20:33:23 5 Star: Kara R. "Best oil change experience i've ever had! Their website was super informative when I was..."...
1294 2018-03-03 20:33:20 If it's any consolation ours died on Christmas Eve and  we had to wait two weeks to get it replaced at a cost of two and a half grand, but I had to buy portable oil filled rads to keep us going which cost €300 and then, to top it off, the lekki bill then came in at €315
1295 2018-03-03 20:33:19 Are we all still taking fish oil pills or nah?
1296 2018-03-03 20:33:16 Your right ndp and liberals are working  togeather to destroy oil& gas
1297 2018-03-03 20:33:14 ... At least the oil companies produce something the average person can actually use.
1298 2018-03-03 20:33:13 If zionists are dealing with you because of your "affiliation" (You claim being  cousins), they won't see any issue to welcome you without "the oil".

1300 2018-03-03 20:33:10 You can’t underestimate Elon Musk. His followers are correct he is a genius. Not in business or technology, but in snake oil sales. If his business is in jeapordy it will necessitate he use his gift. He’s proved this skill many times.

1304 2018-03-03 20:32:54 yes yes yes YES! my 12yo German shepherd has degenerative myleopathy (doggy ALS) for which there is no treatment/cure. CBD oil does wonders for him. He can barely walk without it.

1307 2018-03-03 20:32:19 The piece on Bear’s ears and Zinke and the scam to open the land for oil was important and deserves the spotlight. #TrumpRussia #TrumpCrimeFamily
1308 2018-03-03 20:31:46 Highly refined peanut oil is not required to be labeled as an allergen. Studies show that most people with peanut allergy can safely eat this kind of peanut oil. If you are allergic to peanuts, ask your doctor whether you should avoid peanut oil.
1309 2018-03-03 20:31:44 I love coconut oil. I put it in my frizzy curly hair and it’s not frizzy anymore.
1310 2018-03-03 20:31:18 Sitting waiting for my car to get it’s oil changed and I hear someone yell from outside “where did you say that gas line is?” And then I hear them bang a t-post into the ground... so much for waiting for an answer.... #PleaseDontBlowUp
1311 2018-03-03 20:31:14 FOE, I 100% support your/our cause, but wouldn't any secretary of the interior meet with fossil fuel execs numerous times? Meetings are inevitable if your job is to regulate the use of oil and gas resources on federal land. I'm sure you have a  sharper tidbit to include than that

1313 2018-03-03 20:31:06 Capoue was very poor today, gave away too much possession in the midfield, I’ve seen oil tankers turn quicker then him, I just want him to face the play and move the ball forward. Apart from that a fantastic win, home form is fantastic, just keep going boys. You ornsssssssss
1314 2018-03-03 20:31:03 @mhoilpaints I read a report from a manufacturer about using zinc white causing problems in oil paintings, and they are phasing out the usage of it. Any thoughts about it?

1319 2018-03-03 20:30:03 I’m sorry if I come across as negative or whatever it is but the coaching/line combos are piss poor and giving a guy top line minutes going 27 plus games without a goal DOES affect other players. Kass can’t play with MCD? Sure could. Slepy, Jesse? Ridiculous

1325 2018-03-03 20:29:28 finally getting an oil change, my daddy would beat my ass if he knew how long it’s been since I’ve had one 
1326 2018-03-03 20:29:19 still ana tare; but truth has to be told no matter whose axe is gored
1327 2018-03-03 20:29:12 I opened some bio oil and my first reaction was to smell it and holy s h i t, smelled like fireball idk how probably doesn’t actually but I wanted to throw tf up
1328 2018-03-03 20:29:12 i dont trust ppl who put coconut oil on their face as moisturizer 
1329 2018-03-03 20:29:09 Coconut oil does wonders for my hair , only thing i use
1330 2018-03-03 20:29:05 You didn’t took anything... unless you’re able to spill oil from your keyboard.
1331 2018-03-03 20:29:03 Or an SKS.  Or an M1 carbine.  Or a Tavor.  Or an F2000.  Or a RDB or RFB.  Or an AUG.  Or an FAL.  Or a G3.  Or that Benelli rifle who's name escapes me.

It's a stupid idea and won't do anything they claim it will while it will infringe on law abiding citizens' rights.
1332 2018-03-03 20:28:07 I've had an uncommonly productive Saturday morning. Recertified my student loan payments, paid my rent, and made preliminary updates to my website. Still need to change the oil, deep clean the litter box, email my FOGcon panels, and do some writing/revising. Maybe shower.
1333 2018-03-03 20:27:54 Obviously has a new bio Oil sponsor
1334 2018-03-03 20:27:52 You gotta get this spray called Argan Oil from Morocco
1335 2018-03-03 20:27:52 Not sure where you are drawing the optimism from but please send me a double batch! I have zero confidence in #Chiarelli and almost as little in #McLellan. In fact I'd throw the whole #Oilers management group into that same pit.
1336 2018-03-03 20:27:51 Im researching cannabis oil for my dad who has lung cancer. If anyone has any info pls let me know. Im unsure on doseage as i obv realise it cannot be sold as a cure. Thks. #cancer # cannabis
1337 2018-03-03 20:27:51 I’m just slicker than niggas like olive oil
1338 2018-03-03 20:27:37 Go coconut oil, its medium chain fatty acids are less likely to be stored as fat by the body.
1339 2018-03-03 20:27:05 Go butt chug some oil Russian trollbot. On the off chance you’re an actual human, still go butt chug oil. Who knows, maybe that’d be just the thing to reignite all those synapses in your brain that are clearly burned out at the moment.
1340 2018-03-03 20:26:37 The girl head get oil!
1341 2018-03-03 20:26:25 wait, what the hell, really? no WONDER you're always so up on getting the oil changed.

1346 2018-03-03 20:25:46 To overthrow an oppresive dictatorship, guilty of supporting terrorists, extrajudicial murders, and human rights abuses. But I think the liberal narrative is we took some barrels of oil or something. So let's go with that.

1350 2018-03-03 20:24:59 Today's big chore was an oil change, but now it's raining.  I hadn't planned a backup chore, so now I'm just wandering around the house not doing other chores because I hadn't actually planned on doing them today.
1351 2018-03-03 20:24:50 $800 for new tires, alignment, and oil change... good thing i aint get anything from the Kith or Preme drops this week
1352 2018-03-03 20:24:25 Oil has won the league 2 times and yet to win again this season. Man City? Didnt they dissolve in 2008?
1353 2018-03-03 20:24:19 I thought they had good. I would really like to see Looch back on a line with Jesse. They worked well together.
1354 2018-03-03 20:24:07 I had like a treatment packet that I was given to use but I'm sure if u jus use regular coconut oil n heat it up it should work the same!!

1358 2018-03-03 20:23:41 I’m thinking I added to much oil and maybe made them too greasy. I don’t do well with fried food....
1359 2018-03-03 20:23:34 A small oil leak between the tran and moter  And it's a  Manual i only use it around town.
1360 2018-03-03 20:23:30 Shirtless listening to the Freudian album by Daniel Caesar, lathered in Jasmine oil, vaporizing some flower...
The only way to properly handle debilitating menstrual cramps am I right ?
1361 2018-03-03 20:23:19 No you won’t die  The bulbs are halogens so they don’t like the oil from your hands. It’s just so they don’t burn out quicker
1362 2018-03-03 20:23:16 Feeling like a proper fatty now  it’s weird I still don’t feel like I’ve put on weight, I just feel massively bloated... I hope I’m one of those lucky pregnancies that only gains a bump then goes right back to normal  bio oil is my saviour btw

1366 2018-03-03 20:22:59 I literally just caught a pretty good backhand slap because I said Lucic wasn’t playing well with McD and Draisaitl. Slepy played great with McD. Period
1367 2018-03-03 20:22:35 Exactly. A year into general elections, no one has come out to tell us what exactly they will do differently. I would like to hear from various candidates how they will govern the country with or without oil revenues. For me, that is very very very important. Lol.
1368 2018-03-03 20:22:15 My Yoruba half is always urging me to add more oil to whatever I'm cooking.
1369 2018-03-03 20:22:03 I'm tired of hearing about one cee c everyone hates,when will she b eliminated so my TL rest
1370 2018-03-03 20:21:58 Don’t mention the oil we have -ssshh
1371 2018-03-03 20:21:42 Lol. 
Olive oil, soy (Or pea) protein, so no animal products that would be in reg mayo.
1372 2018-03-03 20:21:24 They make some really awesome dog treats that contain CBD oil. If you’re going to give him straight oil, check the MG and dosage per day that’s healthy for him. 
1373 2018-03-03 20:21:21 tried it all. Witch hazel, tea tree oil & Mario Badescu spot treatment are my daily go-to’s. Hormones coming for my neck, LOL.
1374 2018-03-03 20:21:11 Riddle me this, @TeamCavuto, how much market share did the USA take from Russia this past winter in Oil and Natural Gas Sales to Eastern Europe?

1377 2018-03-03 20:21:00 Hi @NS_online, 

The escalator to go down at track 20A at Utrecht Central Station needs some oil. It makes mad noise.  Would be amazing if someone checks it. 

Cheers.
1378 2018-03-03 20:20:38 You are speaking my language @Beaglepapa71 I obviously have a bias, but I think he has earned it too!
1379 2018-03-03 20:20:24 ACcording to Baker Hughes, there are 211 oil rigs in Canada vs 800 in the United States.
1380 2018-03-03 20:20:19 Also the cost of domestic oil drilling, uses lots of steel pipe.
1381 2018-03-03 20:20:19 Many people die without fulfilling their destiny but anointing with oil can prepare you to fulfilling your destiny.

1386 2018-03-03 20:19:50 Guess who forgot to put coconut oil on her rehealing tattoo? I got my bouquet retouched on Sunday
1387 2018-03-03 20:19:47 It's an older laptop, even after cleaning it out the fan's still loud. No hub hole to add a drop of oil, unfortunately

1390 2018-03-03 20:19:22 How was Burrard Thermal unjustifiable? Tommy Douglas oversaw, as Premier of Sask. one of the largest national building of oil and gas pipeline networks in Canada that still exists today. Charlie, you didn't think this one through at all.
1391 2018-03-03 20:19:22 Trade Deals ?????? hmmm do you mean the trade when you force yourself into other countries and take all there resources and oil,diamonds,and pay them penny's.
Who is loosing out here? You corrupt your own country you kill your own people,you create war around the world.

1396 2018-03-03 20:18:34 Just wondering if you have ever tried CBD oil?  Physical Therapy hasn't helped?
1397 2018-03-03 20:18:28 Very unfortunate. When other countries are moving away from over dependence on crude oil, here we are still wasting resources meant for infrastructural development to explore for oil. Perhaps, we will use the oil to cook egusi soup and fry akara.
1398 2018-03-03 20:18:23 The power of the Holy Spirit is glad power! Our Savior, Jesus Christ, lived His beautiful, holy life on earth and did His healing, saving deeds of power in the strength of this oil of gladness.  #Tozer

NHL guys in his round,including Khaira,(late bloomer w/Oil), D Ghostisbehere/Parayko.Vesey/Lindell/Murray/Pelech/ varying success, Freddy Anderson (w/Van pick). However ,13 players from that round, have never played an NHL game. Almost half.
1401 2018-03-03 20:17:53 The wingers we had would fill #Oilers holes very nicely today. Squandered. The race to mediocrity continues unabated! We will end up being an annual mid pack team with one superstar when #Chiarelli is finished and kicking turds down the road.
1402 2018-03-03 20:17:53 So Venezuela is socialist, let's just begin there. - I wonder what would happen to British economy if oil suddenly went up to 5x the price it is now. Well something similar happened in 73, oil prices spiked. - The reverse happened in Venezuela.
1403 2018-03-03 20:17:40 Suppose to just get an oil change and spent $200

1416 2018-03-03 20:16:01 Haha!!
1417 2018-03-03 20:15:56 The reason that Mexico’s lost decade didn’t start 1976 was because of the discovery of new oil deposits, which rapidly increased Mexico’s oil exports, allowing Lopez Portillo to pay off the IMF credits in 1977 two years early and gradually stray from the IMF’s targets. 12/12

1426 2018-03-03 20:14:27 Can’t believe how many people have complained at the fact we’ve had to shut aisles in store because of a water/oil spillage... ITS FOR YOUR SAFETY YOU BLOODY MUPPETS
1427 2018-03-03 20:14:26 Just saw a commercial saying corn oil is healthier than olive oil 
1428 2018-03-03 20:14:25 This is why the likes of Jane Fonda and Leonardo DiCaprio fly up to Fort McMurray in their fancy jets, helicopter around various oil sand projects and cry out environmental disaster. These people are paid to do this. It's all part of the campaign to land lock our oil.

1435 2018-03-03 20:12:46 Do you think oil will last forever ?
1436 2018-03-03 20:12:43 A recovery that has been pushed by big oil and their investments, which the gov’t has done much to discourage up until recent commitments of already existing quotas, and Tmountin; and resilient small buisness owners tightening their wallets and keeping people emplyed.

1453 2018-03-03 20:09:54 As for calling crude oil returns "loot", that speaks a lot about where your mind is.

However, I'd advise you to first go and investigate how much the govt really made from crude oil sales and what recurrent expenditure is like.

Then you'll know how much was left for infra.

1467 2018-03-03 20:07:46 This will increase the cost of cars. Fewer people will be able to afford them. Demand for fossil fuels will drop. Your friends in oil and gas won’t like you. Sure you want t o do this?
1468 2018-03-03 20:07:35 I will be surprised if he isn't back in Russia in the fall. Writing's already on the wall. #Oilers alienate another good prospect through mismanagement, lack of development and playing time in situations in which they can gain confidence and succeed. Shame!

1497 2018-03-03 20:04:34 Catalytic reforming is an old technology so refineries that have this capability, it's not an overwhelming cost. Making diesel from shale oil is much more problematic b/c it simply lacks the middle distillates necessary. Maybe @Big_Orrin knows more?

1506 2018-03-03 20:03:26 Venezuela isn't socialist, they fit the definition of state capitalism much more (state control of means of production). A large amount of their economy is still private. Also when your economy relies so heavily on oil, an industry that has seen a huge drop in prices.......

In that case, stop sticking your nose into other countries problems in your thirst for oil...
The reason America is (was) a big player is due to respect.
At the moment, you have an idiot in power with no brains, so he's being a bully.

1540 2018-03-03 19:59:51 I’m stuck at Toyota for an hour & a half just for an oil change :(
1541 2018-03-03 19:59:35 Bakken oil is about as good as it gets. Similar to Saudi crude. That’s what the runaway train that blew up in PQ was hauling.
1542 2018-03-03 19:59:34 The fact is there is alot of heavy crude that takes just as much refining as the "Oil Sands" before transport.
You just have to do the research. Another fact is pipeline companies still want to build pipelines.
It's only goverment regs that stop them.
1543 2018-03-03 19:59:30 that's great looking forward working in an oil company..
1544 2018-03-03 19:59:30 Spent the day at the market buying wine & food and made baked cheesecake. Mostly I can't wait to serve my rosemary & olive oil loaf tomorrow
1545 2018-03-03 19:59:27 very little oil used in making phones , most of it probably to do with transport if anything , like extracting the other minerals used. But I get your argument lol.

NSO is thick oil , its use is of course plastic byproducts , but shale oil and gas is dominant in chems instead.

1555 2018-03-03 19:57:50 totally agree with you.. without the cheap, but strong wingers, the 3 center route is not do-able for them. Nuge or McDavid needs Leon on the wing to have a successful top 2 lines.
1556 2018-03-03 19:57:18 You do know he was a registered DEM before running, and most DEMS don't like him either. You all  bought the snake oil. You voted for a party, not a man.
1557 2018-03-03 19:57:17 Y querer volver, aunq sea simbólicamente, a los tiempos de la standard oil company
1558 2018-03-03 19:57:14 Getting this Oil Change out the way. Adulting never stops
1559 2018-03-03 19:57:13 i need to tell yall about the godly salad i just made: chopped romaine. finely diced bell pepper and onion. crispy pancetta. crumbled gorgonzola. homemade garlic croutons. dressing = maple syrup, olive oil, apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, s&p.
1560 2018-03-03 19:57:09 It will be even better! We're going to take the Korean's oil with us! We won't be stupid and leave the oil behind like we did in Iraq. And, by the way, we won't tell them when we're going to leave!    [Feels like there should be more CAPS!]
1561 2018-03-03 19:57:01 Come on now that's a bunch of b******* the boys from the guy on the sector showed not the other show with the fat face Irish dude with the propane oil
1562 2018-03-03 19:56:42 To bad we can't get a strong conservative to replace @RepSwalwell He has fed his loyal liberal sheep so much snake oil they believe he is god like!!

1564 2018-03-03 19:56:36 Hi MJ & Jenn. I know that’s true abt gas. They def have us by the short hairs! But a lot of us have changed our habits in that regard. We just do the best we can. Filling up at an independent takes $ away from big oil. Do it if u can. Thanks.
1565 2018-03-03 19:56:32 Also, probably nothing...but I felt like he actually wanted to go to Boston...
Orr was his agent, I believe his Mom was a Bruins fan and, this is probably me reading way too much into it, as seen on ‘Oil Change’, he wore a Red Sox hat (Big B) through the airport before the draft
1566 2018-03-03 19:56:22 The place I go to get my oil changed has you stay in the car unless you are having them do some service that requires lifting the car. In MN.
1567 2018-03-03 19:56:22 Look around. Every facet of your environment has products from chemical industry in them. Hence my disparaging remark about lentil phone. Barring a return to Stone Age we will continue to extract and refine oil for chemicals.
1568 2018-03-03 19:55:58 So I found a shop that lets me change my oil for free lol I gotta do all the work but I can’t beat that tbh

1571 2018-03-03 19:55:35 Dotem could singlehandedly lower the price of oil and bring peace to the Middle East
1572 2018-03-03 19:55:29 I see a huge difference in my hair using castor oil 
1573 2018-03-03 19:55:16 What about oil worth more than $800 Billion that US robbed from Arabian countries?
1574 2018-03-03 19:55:11 Unlikely... the status quo has become even more important to maintain given the oil and gas operations in the sea.
1575 2018-03-03 19:55:09 From what I've read he said that the bible tells us to harvest what the Earth is giving us, i. e. gas, oil, etc., fresh from Bear's Ears National Park, UT (or what used to be Bear's Ears National Park anyway ...). How is he not afraid of having his soul stolen by cameras?
1576 2018-03-03 19:55:06 Nature rocks!!... wonder if this happens anywhere near an oil sands scabby scarred land?...Ms. NOTley? 
Say no to KM pipeline.
1577 2018-03-03 19:55:06 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. Yet they are starving due to their socialism. BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
1578 2018-03-03 19:55:02 Yep so you don't think its rude for conte to expect Chelsea to spend the same as Utd (who have much higher commercial revenue) & City (who are backed by an oil state)?
1579 2018-03-03 19:54:26 Hi. DM? I'm interested in your Palm kernel oil. @engrnolly
1580 2018-03-03 19:54:22 I literally just bought primrose oil supplements earlier today! I hope they work, I’ve heard some really good things!
1581 2018-03-03 19:54:22 I have to go get an oil change today and I already know this dealership is going to try to pull a fast one on me.
1582 2018-03-03 19:54:16 My bab oil yourself
1583 2018-03-03 19:54:09 Looking at those lines I don't even know who to be angrier at any more, Chiarelli for turning a brand new Cadilac into a 2007 F250 or Todd for refusing to give the damn thing an Oil change.  Strap these dummies in.... +  #FireChiarelli
1584 2018-03-03 19:54:03 Have you checked the ingredients on that one. My son was having the little kidz food pots. They've changed it to by nature and changed sunflower oil to extra virgin oil, he now won't eat it xx
1585 2018-03-03 19:53:57 Um... Alberta has hundreds of drill rigs drilling for conventional oil.
1586 2018-03-03 19:53:51 What type of oil edakun?
1587 2018-03-03 19:53:50 Vaseline and Coconut oil are literally god sends for bad skin 
1588 2018-03-03 19:53:37 Try drinking coffee after taking the oil.. or put the oil on a piece of chocolate and put that under your tongue 
1589 2018-03-03 19:53:18 One of the reasons is the high price of fuel which the US and other oil producers control. Americans benefit from low fuel costs, Europeans are paying on avg €1.30 a LITRE of fuel.
1590 2018-03-03 19:53:15 Yes! My dog is epileptic, we give her CBD oil and cookies for her seizures and they’ve helped a ton. I’ve used it on my mini pin as well, for his anxiety and that has helped a lot. We’ve never had go medicate or tranquilize our dogs since we’ve introduced CBD oil.
1591 2018-03-03 19:53:07 
1592 2018-03-03 19:53:07 Yes hope they and their clingons get everything they deserve. I wonder if any familiar names will disappear from financial bulletin boards. Hmmm hahah

1599 2018-03-03 19:51:58 Canada is major supplier of aluminum to your military.  Canada buys more US steel then we sell to you. We are your major supplier of oil. Canada also supplies New York City with cheap hydro from Quebec. We are your biggest trade partner and ally. He is starting to piss us off.
1600 2018-03-03 19:51:41 Awww, this mallam came by just to give me new oil for free sampling after I bought twice last month. I feel so loved 
1601 2018-03-03 19:51:35 Have you tried coconut oil? I get dry patches around my eyes too and that’s what I use to keep it moisturized
1602 2018-03-03 19:51:33 "Oil up a bowl, place 'er in there, and cover her up for about twenty-four hours. That's the dough!"

"For the sauce, take two cloves of garlic, a teaspoon of oregano, and a half-drained can of tomatoes, twenty-eight ounces. Simmer that up for for about 30 minutes of cooking."

1605 2018-03-03 19:51:05 Good man, Gary! Did you check tires and oil?
1606 2018-03-03 19:51:04 Oh yes, I guess it’s the fans fault now that the oil are struggling. Haha I don’t think Anderson was throwing a jab at Hall at all. He congratulated him then seemed to be pumping his own tires. And it’s comments like that that prove everything that’s wrong with milennials today.
1607 2018-03-03 19:51:02 Coco butter lotion, coco oil is my bestfriends rn
1608 2018-03-03 19:50:50 Oil weighs more than its underlying constituents because the energy has weight. Unsure if this applies to batteries.
1609 2018-03-03 19:50:39 These things are also super good stir-fried! These, bok choy, chicken, and bell pepper. Simple seasoning with sesame oil, mirin, and a bit of chili oil, and man it's tasty!
1610 2018-03-03 19:50:27 I always get lavender scented oil, it smells wonderful
1611 2018-03-03 19:50:25 Why have you not deleted this tweet? Even the S*n has done so, admitting it's wildly inaccurate. Is it because you're an unprincipled charlatan and snake oil salesman perhaps. How has politics sunk so low?
1612 2018-03-03 19:50:19 Try putting cannabis oil on it.
1613 2018-03-03 19:50:18 Only if you are dirty and smelly heavily of pachouli oil.

1618 2018-03-03 19:49:44 I'm an oil bull and think we're close to the start of the next leg up, but theres nothing wrong about the statement that extreme positioning poses a risk.
1619 2018-03-03 19:49:40 depends where you get them! some places like McDonald’s aren’t vegan because of what they use to fry them. a lot of places use peanut oil though!
1620 2018-03-03 19:49:34 I just realized you said oil pull. what are you using?
1621 2018-03-03 19:49:28 "Mix sixteen ounces of flour with a tablespoon of sugar, two teaspoons of salt and yeast until combined. Slowly mix in a cup and a quarter of cold water plus a tablespoon of oil. Oil the resulting dough up and knead until smooth."

1635 2018-03-03 19:48:36 RUN AWAY, JENNA.
1636 2018-03-03 19:48:34 US-Canada trade numbers are also distorted by the value of crude oil supplied by Canada to the US. Without that oil the trade deficit would be a whole lot worse. Cheap, dependable, Canadian oil powers a big chunk of US economic activity... Is Trump gonna put a tariff on oil next?
1637 2018-03-03 19:48:00 @SecretaryZinke   how much money is the oil lobby stuffing in your pockets. It wouldn't surprise me, if you could, to see you open up all ferderal lands to big business interests. Especially if you benefit financially from it and your interests aren't effected.

1644 2018-03-03 19:46:14 That experience with a great teacher inspired me to start learning other art styles. So far, I've been learning oil pastels, watercolours, and acrylic pour painting. I've never been good at art (I can't even draw a straight line), but I am enjoying the hell out of this.
1645 2018-03-03 19:46:12 Is it oils? Or acrylic? Oil painting my favourite  Actually getting quite excited about starting the course now 
1646 2018-03-03 19:46:09 Use Bio oil it works fine with scars.

1649 2018-03-03 19:45:46 Oh snap.  & this week we learned that Qatar was the buyer of that mystery big stake in Russia’s Roseneft Oil Co.  After buy, Kushner attempted to get Massive Loan from Qatar for his failing RealEstate Debt.  But Qatar Refused Kushner Loan.  So Kushner then seeks revenge on Qatar
1650 2018-03-03 19:45:45 No it really doesn't. Although investing in a facial steamer and olbus oil is handy too.

1659 2018-03-03 19:44:58 What a crappy night at the track last night. Got spun and put to the rear. Rough track surprised i didnt put a hole in the oil pan
1660 2018-03-03 19:44:45 Bloody hell Dan your on the ball to spot that. Good engine if set up right. And don't suffer from oil pressure issue's in the corners with a custom built sump..
1661 2018-03-03 19:44:30 Try Cetaphil. Or best get some of that coconut oil and apply right after shower on moist skin. Then wait till you dry.
1662 2018-03-03 19:44:29 tyres will still be used obviously, but the "rubber" is a byproduct of petrochem which will taper off - tyres thus will become far more expensive, and therfore an increased drive, pardon the pun , to public transport for cities. OIL has its best before date.

1672 2018-03-03 19:42:48 What a mean SOB. Mongolian Madness out of control ! Petros please use your powerful influence to stop those terrible Tartars before they seize control of the oil refineries in Torrance. The very existence of the universe is in your hands .
1673 2018-03-03 19:42:35 Those criteria are for pop music. The best rappers rarely go mainstream. Modenine is literally the precursor to all Nigerian rappers. Buh "he's so underground, crude oil leaks from his ceiling" 
1674 2018-03-03 19:42:22 the term "canola oil" is short for "Canada Oil low acid," a name coined to avoid the less marketable word for the product, "rapeseed oil"

1682 2018-03-03 19:41:51 2 And five of them were wise, and five were foolish. 3 They  that were  foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them: 4 But the  wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.”-
1683 2018-03-03 19:41:37 @tiffanyenaj this is the skin care routine I've been doing the only thing I do differently is adding tea tree oil at the end and I use different lotion. She said it took her about 2 months for her skin to clear up.
1684 2018-03-03 19:41:30 Oil will still be coming out of the North Sea when my grandchildren’s children are grown ups. Everyone knows we are still 40-50 years away from peak oil.
1685 2018-03-03 19:41:26 Because of our lack of pipeline capacity, and our inability to get oil & gas to tidewater, we LOSE $100 million per day, every day, 365 days a year - that is $36 billion in lost revenue alone.

He's the one who "imports" employees instead of hiring citizens, imports Russian & Chinese steel & helped kill American Steel, the best in the world, by using foreign in his buildings & oil pipelines.

1708 2018-03-03 19:37:58 Yeah right... because Russian wants America to be energy independent and to export oil and build up our military. You all are a bunch of Arsehats. Sore Loserman lives again. So what Dem is going to run in 2020... Oprah?  what a joke
1709 2018-03-03 19:37:51 Today we’re running a free oil change promotional event at our shop at Oceanside Motorsports where we primarily do European car repairs and build race cars and this guy literally brought in his bread delivery truck for an oil change...
1710 2018-03-03 19:37:43 It is the...logical? natural? inevitable? result when someone w. enough power wanted to argue that something true, wasn't. I'm not sure if it was big tobacco, or big oil that tipped it, but this is the result of a deliberate effort to delegitimize science & evidence based policy.
1711 2018-03-03 19:37:39 How about an engine oil dip stick instead of a coat hanger?
1712 2018-03-03 19:37:38 Perfect day to get your girl car washed and oil change if needed.
1713 2018-03-03 19:37:21 seems like some young entrepreneurs can make a lot of money/benefits from 45’s name.
negative use of that thing’s name is an untapped oil well.
1714 2018-03-03 19:36:52 there's a very good chance I put cuticle oil on an ear pimple instead of Clearasil #nightshifts
1715 2018-03-03 19:36:48 Indeed. There is a real debate to be had here. Taking the snake oil might be tempting, but I pretty certain the “disease” won’t be cured with it.
1716 2018-03-03 19:36:39 Sometimes things happen that's out of our hands behind the scenes who really knows oil guess that's why he said XBOX needs a overhaul - they put a bad jacket on Phil and it stuck since the 2013 fiasco! Often you can give people what they want and their still not happy

1724 2018-03-03 19:35:06 What I find crazy is Newfoundland.  Given the dependence it has on Alberta oil economy (transient pop) for it to go so Liberal is just unexpected.

1734 2018-03-03 19:33:42 Posted on @GavinNewsom the link to the USA today article. No response to my inquiry on how doubling down on current policies is going to make things better. Like a snake oil charlatan.
1735 2018-03-03 19:33:40 What about things that directly go against science like lights ability to bend in water to reveal the colour spectra (in water but also oil)? That apparently didn't exist until after the impossible flood.
1736 2018-03-03 19:33:36 Klopp is now 15 points ahead of Wenger.
Poch is 13 points ahead of Wenger.
Both have played 1 more game.

Neither club has oil money.
Both clubs' wages are less than the Wenger boys.

1738 2018-03-03 19:33:24 Shocked - SHOCKED - to find out internal emails show oil was central in the Trump Administration's decision to shrink protected national monuments.
1739 2018-03-03 19:33:01 The drop of oil prices only left the terrible regime naked bc they could no longer sustain the farce!
1740 2018-03-03 19:32:59 I’m definitely going to start doing oil treatments now. And thank you for your amazing article on “what it means to be and love an empath”. I struggled so much through life explaining to others and even myself what im feeling. I’m an emotional healing and precognition empath

1744 2018-03-03 19:32:27 Putin is throwing out the N word (Nukes) for 2 reasons imo 1. to rally support from his ppl for upcoming elections but 2. just as important he wants to drive up oil prices as it is about 80% of his income and he needs cash bad. Dangerous environment.
1745 2018-03-03 19:32:22 Taught the 13 year old how to change the oil. Next time he’ll do everything and I’ll just watch and make sure he’s getting it right.

1751 2018-03-03 19:31:16 Just so everyone knows. Some vitamins are more pure then others. Like let's say a 1000mg of fish oil. U can buy one fish oil over the counter for 20$ but another 1000mg of fish oil is prescribed because it's more pure and is 300$.  Not sure if u get my point here.

1755 2018-03-03 19:30:53 Best way to crush Ru & Putin, is to lower gas & oil prices & to steal their customers from them. Hurt Putin & Ru in the pocket book will make Putin look weak

1757 2018-03-03 19:30:18 What if renewables received a quarter or the world wide subsidies oil and gas recieve. Where would we be if renewables got the same corporate welfare that oil and gas gets? Could we have fusion figured out? Could we have thorium reactors?

1762 2018-03-03 19:30:03 "Went in for a oil change through the express service lane. Took about one hour for the change. Maybe they need to take the word express out. Other than that I had no problems with the service." John M., Facebook Review
1763 2018-03-03 19:30:00 You have indicated, so eloquently, that you truly are an idiot. You apparently believe that the US can be a self supporting country that doesn't have to deal with other counties on ANY LEVEL. The US does not, and never has, produced enough oil/gas for its own use, for starters.
1764 2018-03-03 19:29:56 What's the best marinade you've made by throwing in whatever you find you have on hand? Just put Maple Bourbon, molasses, sriracha, OJ, Worcestershire, jalapeno olive oil and garlic together for a flank steak.

But she kept the budget balanced.

BC was doing good.

Now you have oil hating turds running the show.  . . It's worked out so well for Alberta and Ontario.

This Country is doomed if we don't have Conservatives taking the power back!

1781 2018-03-03 19:27:42 To blame only the Government is a mistake. I'm not saying they're perfect but international interference, unjust sanctions, the drop of oil prices would mean any system of government would struggle.
1782 2018-03-03 19:27:41 Our Wine and Olive Oil industries (and many others) have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the known world. We must not let our republic, and the wealthy be taken advantage of any longer. We want free, fair and SMART TRADE!

1787 2018-03-03 19:27:10 On the other hand I'm not 100% anti-Russian either. Like everyone else Russia has to take care of their business, the majority of which is oil exports, and they are feeling pinched.
1788 2018-03-03 19:26:59 Since switching all my skincare to Arbonne my skin, lips, hair etc are all in great condition. The Shea butter lip balm is natural and lovely. All vegan with no nasties like mineral oil, parabens etc. Online only high end brand  I will never use Vaseline and the like again.

1791 2018-03-03 19:26:36 Shhhhhh. Don’t tell them there’s like a ton of other platforms that do the same as ar 15.

1793 2018-03-03 19:26:33 US is poised to become the largest oil producer in the World. In reality we do not need EU, they need us. EU is going straight to shambles and civil war against the Moslems. That is the reason for Bretxi. Just grab the popcorn, a drink and a good seat.

I need alcohol
1798 2018-03-03 19:26:16 Hey, Deplorables!  @realDonaldTrump is coming for your guns.  He said so himself.  Take the guns early, due process second.  Told you he was a snake oil salesman.  You drank it down, anyway.  Glug, glug!  Suckers!

If @realDonaldTrump does that, it may make us a little safer.

1807 2018-03-03 19:25:02 not neccessarily , the anti plastic drive , which brent is best for is also heading for decline , as will tyres and tar mac which is also dependendant on it with changeover to public transport. As I said , peak oil has a sell by date , one that Scots indy needs to grab.
1808 2018-03-03 19:24:50 The @FA fining the oil rich Manchester City £50,000 for their misdeeds at Wigan - yeah that'll really act as a deterrent to stop them doing that again! Those idiots @FA really don't have a grasp of reality #laughingstock
1809 2018-03-03 19:24:46 I've noticed my friends who hate when their favorite genre "becomes" politicized didn't seem to mind when one of their favorite movies opened with a voiceover monologue about how we burned through all the oil and now the world is a desert wasteland.
1810 2018-03-03 19:24:35 Go f*ck yourselves. Canada will not be a country that caters to big oil before solving climate change and caring for all of its people. Harper was the last shot, and your party is gone. Come at me trolls.
1811 2018-03-03 19:24:32 Happy birthday Dr.Anas! I`ve learned a lot of things from you about oil and energy economics since I was following you.

1813 2018-03-03 19:24:04 I’m sure there’s an essential oil to help with that journey.

1831 2018-03-03 19:21:41 Shrunk by 85%. Petroglyphs gone. Cave paintings from 1st cultures gone. New found dinosaur bones can't be excavated w funding appropriated. Bones now outside monument area. Sacred ancestral burial grounds gone.  OUR NATL LAND 4 future generations gone. FOR OIL! Our lands!

1837 2018-03-03 19:21:14 Why is there rapeseed #oil in your #dairyfree m*lk @oatlyuk @minorfigures? #JustAsking as a customer who has an allergy to it, had to opt out. #baristalife
1838 2018-03-03 19:21:10 utterly ridiculous to leave this resource in the ground or not providing world markets by pipelines, oil will be the dominate generator for decades to come and Canada permitting others to capitalize
1839 2018-03-03 19:20:58 Gorgeousness!

1846 2018-03-03 19:20:10 Thank God for bleach and coconut oil respectively.
1847 2018-03-03 19:19:45 Fair enough.
I would have no problem with that. But the east will vote in anti AB oil all day long, but hypocritically have their hands out when we start making money again
1848 2018-03-03 19:19:35 @Nick_Offerman Can I use (boiled?) linseed oil to repair a water stained wooden floor? Also, hello.

1853 2018-03-03 19:19:23 I am so sorry, Chrissy, about your Buddy. Bristol Farms in Woodland Hills has Charlotte’s Web CbD oil for dogs. I saw it there 10 days ago. Look on the Carlotta’s Web website too!
1854 2018-03-03 19:19:19 Comfortability and growth are like oil and water. They just don’t mix.
1855 2018-03-03 19:19:13 Thank you, we are so pleased you are loving your StylPro! Quick tip for better results ... do not mix the cleanser with water, it should be used on its own to remove oil based makeup from brushes. You only need a small amount. Also do not submerge the brush ferrule in the liquid.
1856 2018-03-03 19:19:01 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
1857 2018-03-03 19:18:56 I like snake oil only that’s not what I call it, we all gotta die sometime and no not illegal at least in most states
1858 2018-03-03 19:18:48 On 7/14/16, the driver of a truck purposefully killed 86 people in Nice, France. The French did not scream for the removal of Peugeot, Citron or Renault cars from the country.  They didn’t protest tire makers or oil production. They focused on the source, evil hearts & minds.
1859 2018-03-03 19:18:41 How am I just hearing this @pastorjdunn song “Oil” ? 
1860 2018-03-03 19:18:37 Names of food dat U know
Ajebo: Fried rice
Ajekpako: *Vexed dem dey fry rice, If u put oil 4 pan den fry am oil go too much. Ur mama no sabi
1861 2018-03-03 19:18:36 Yea. I know that. Emeka Ojukwu I mentioned is regarding the British interests in oil installations in Biafra which he commanded. 

It was always about oil.
1862 2018-03-03 19:18:25 In 1973 and 1974. The Middle East held us at the point of a nozzle. Oil shortage long lines. WW II we were the overwhelming producer of steel and this enabled the USA to build ships tanks and planes fast. Now we only produce 5%. What happens.
1863 2018-03-03 19:18:23 If @McDonalds wants to increase their sales, which have been decreasing lately, they could start by appealing to vegetarian/vegan/gf populations. It could all start by using different oil to make their fries. Just a thought.
1864 2018-03-03 19:18:18 Having to take your car to get an oil change is the equivalent to visiting Satan’s lair
1865 2018-03-03 19:18:13 coconut oil is my body’s best friend

1868 2018-03-03 19:17:30 @thebodycoach looking to follow your 90 day plan however I can allergic to coconut and I notice you use coconut oil in your recipes. Could you please suggest an alternative that I could use instead?
1869 2018-03-03 19:17:13 -The Azerbaijan trip seems to me happened just before the Ukrainian Euromaidan in Kiev.
I guess that withoiut the green light on either TAP or Azerbaijan oil it would have never happened. Ukraine is a transit route for Russian oil into EU. Can't cut without an alternative.
1870 2018-03-03 19:17:11 When oil prices were high more than 90 USD barrel we do not pay extra these taxes are used to set off the high rate Similarly when prices fall they don't pass the benefits so that when prices rise these taxes are used to set off the raise. This is done to keep inflation in check
1871 2018-03-03 19:16:27 Butane oil!

Doesn't a cute guy wave at me while I'm there, with my hair looking like an oil factory 
1881 2018-03-03 19:15:14 RT @LivingSafely: Eating Propyl Alcohol this March? Used as a synthetic flavoring, it's made from natural gas and fusel oil.
1882 2018-03-03 19:15:11 Transmission service costs more than an oil change, but is not required near as much. So worth it!
1883 2018-03-03 19:15:08 There’re two reasons why a such oil wealthy state suffers economically, first reason its corrupted rulers, second one it’s a victim of being close geographically to US
1884 2018-03-03 19:15:00 I can agree with you on this Stephen King, We need more Renewable and Cheaper Energy in Puerto Rico not the Private Oil and Gas Energy.
1885 2018-03-03 19:14:55 Correct ,the oil helped

1887 2018-03-03 19:14:54 I have a friend who gave her aging dog Cbd oil and it gave him a new lease on life. It was sweet to see him act like a puppy again.
1888 2018-03-03 19:14:35 @Phivida I am new to this so please be patient with my ignorance. I am 57 and have had 11 surgeries. Knees, back, foot amongst them. My son recommended cbd oil to help with the pain. My dog has anxiety/seizures. Can we take the same product?
1889 2018-03-03 19:14:29 Bumping the new Nipsey doing an oil change “catching a vibe”
1890 2018-03-03 19:14:23 "Trump is unleashing the American energy industry: more fracking, more offshore drilling, and approval for the Keystone Pipeline.  This is important because 52% of the Russian government budget comes from sales of oil and gas."

also, exporting gas to Poland.  And no Paris Accord
1891 2018-03-03 19:14:08 first go at oil painting was pretty nice, looking forward to using it more
1892 2018-03-03 19:14:07 I think the only way to stop terrorism in the whole world is to ban mullahs' economical trades, banks, oil sells and everything that produces money for them
1893 2018-03-03 19:13:43 Sounds like a good plan. 
Lots of hot liquids and lemon icies, seem to help as well. 
My granny would make Greek chicken lemon soup and drop oil on my head.:) lol
So yes,a nap sounds a much grander idea.

1924 2018-03-03 19:10:32 There's lots of places that have you wait in the car while they change your oil in the US, though I've only encountered them on the west coast. #OilCanHenrys  even gives you a newspaper to read and has cameras so you can watch what they're doing
1925 2018-03-03 19:10:29 big oil or else maybe the analyticals man in CONJUNCTION with those little green cops were DIALING IN through the optics
1926 2018-03-03 19:10:25 @Big_Orrin Question for you.  Data suggests far more shale oil being used in US (now above 50%).  Data suggests very high gasoline builds, in US, despite poor crack rates. Are these 2 related? Why is the US refining complex producing so much gasoline, in a low crack environment?

1933 2018-03-03 19:09:39 Getting my oil changed, and I count at least five separate guys waiting. There are three cars including mine currently here. Are these guys just hanging out for the free popcorn and soda/coffee? @MisterCarWash

1941 2018-03-03 19:09:05 1) Re Iraqi budget for 2018. No surprises. KRG share allocated by Baghdad is less and what they get from independent oil sales. For KRG to get the amount allocated by GOI, they would have to give 250k b/d to GOI to be sold through SOMO.

1980 2018-03-03 19:04:00 Let’s be clear - this is NOT because of lower oil prices.  This is the inevitable result of dictatorial socialism.  Maduro needs to end up like Ceaușescu... and soon!
1981 2018-03-03 19:03:39 Oil this made my heart melt 
1982 2018-03-03 19:03:34 Right. So how come their hardware is covered in logos of oil and gas companies? Just a bit of free advertising out of the kindness of their hearts?

Pull the other one.

1984 2018-03-03 19:03:24 Lmaooo but really tho my hair is thriving w that castor oil, olive oil, and coconut oil mix
1985 2018-03-03 19:03:16 Oh for real, considering we've allowed companies to inject liquid into rocks to extract gas and oil, I'm not sure a heater on the front of a truck would be the worst of our problems 
1986 2018-03-03 19:03:14 We have a trade deficit mostly because we import oil

It is irrelevant. Nobody except the economically illiterate think imbalance in trade is “losing money.” We had trade deficits for half a century, long before GATT or NAFTA. Our dotard thinks like an 18th century mercantilist
1987 2018-03-03 19:03:03 After a little extra search you will discover also that:
-Soros is involved with Turkey's intial push to join the EU in the mid 2000s
-Oil in Turkey is key. Erdogan's family is in the business, ISIS oil entered Turkey through an old Saddam smuggling route.

1989 2018-03-03 19:03:01 What a Doktrin??? Eat that steel...  You need oil Mr P!
1990 2018-03-03 19:02:51 Is tar sands oil the same quality as Texas and North Dakota?  Is the only thing similar the fact that we call it “oil?”  I don’t think this is a direct comparison
1991 2018-03-03 19:02:48 That’s good. They said crashes were also due to oil on the track. Pictures look amazing though. Congratulations!! So impressive 
1992 2018-03-03 19:02:43 CBD oil has been helping with my puppy’s teething stage. Eases some of the pain in his gums as far as I can tell, and calms his puppy tantrums.  I’m positive it will help your Puddy be more comfortable. 
1993 2018-03-03 19:02:43 Lol nuff a unu never ready for the earthquake drill
1994 2018-03-03 19:02:41 Used castor oil, makes the hair grow thicker, :)
1995 2018-03-03 19:02:39 Wonderful. Free oil changes too?
1996 2018-03-03 19:02:25 If #Democrats hate #paying more for things, why haven't they allowed us to build any #oil #refineries in the 20 years??
1997 2018-03-03 19:02:17 Time for my 2nd oil change in  (we really don’t drive very much here). They are again having me stay in the car during the oil change. This never happened to me in .
1998 2018-03-03 19:02:16 I’m pretty sure they used to be perky and crisp. But they actually used 100% potato now days and a lot of the time mine seem a little bit raw crunchy in places... could probably do with seeing the oil for another 5 minutes.
1999 2018-03-03 19:02:14 It's great for a shampoo alternative too but I had to stop using it b/c my hair smelled like vinegar for days! I love eating it but after several pickle comments... LOL Now I use baking soda and olive oil for a scalp rub but you can't use too much!
2000 2018-03-03 19:02:12 use peppermint oil!
2001 2018-03-03 19:02:12 This damn oil change is taking foreverrrrr. 
2002 2018-03-03 19:02:07 I need a oil change ... where should I go ?
2003 2018-03-03 19:02:06 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
2004 2018-03-03 19:02:01 All of the snow has caused drifts in the road and not blown away because of the high hedges. Admittedly snow is massively over-hyped, but our communities have been cut off since Wednesday and there is a milk, oil and essentials shortage in an already vulnerable society
2005 2018-03-03 19:01:52 @_ItsSavannah_ Lavender essiential oil for your burn.. a couple drops every few minutes for an hour..  AMAZING!
2006 2018-03-03 19:01:51 Oil change? Sounds like a clunker. Just leave it on the side of the road and go get your new ride. Shame cars only last 3k miles.
2007 2018-03-03 19:01:39 It's true its the sugars, oil and fat..keep your body alkaline with green smoothies, fruit and veg, it can help fight cancer and stem cells from spreading..
2008 2018-03-03 19:01:36 Yeah I suspected it might happen with all the oil drilling going on
2009 2018-03-03 19:01:28 While others groan, you will grow & like Asher dip ur feet in oil for grace & prosperity. Ur feet shall be as iron to crush Satan's head

2033 2018-03-03 18:59:52 Thanks for your perseverance Tom. There was no point me telling this guy that I was accountant for one of the world's largest oil and property companies. Dialogue (or lack of it) has been interesting  as its show that neoliberals have little empathy with fellow humans.

2035 2018-03-03 18:59:46 i can change your oil for you next time 
2036 2018-03-03 18:59:32 Sure. Maybe in 50 years. Today oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay should be the last barrel produced. What is your choice pay for your free health care or enrich regimes that toss #LGBTQ off Buildings.
2037 2018-03-03 18:59:21 My sweet fiancé got the oil changed in my car & got it washed. Spoiled.
2038 2018-03-03 18:59:15 Did you see her precious President Hatch is caught up in the Bears Ears scandal to reduce its size 85% so companies can drill there for oil and gas. Team Patriot all hail President Hatch!
2039 2018-03-03 18:58:57 Not saying that, but these pipelines need to be built if we have to do it ourselves ABSK  then yes that would mean no equalization payments to the rest of the provinces they can buy their oil else where oh wait they do already

2041 2018-03-03 18:58:46 Makes no therapeutic difference. Yet states will interpret the Hemp Grow law in their own way, and are more likely to go after sellers of hemp oil that have even an iota of THC in them.

2074 2018-03-03 18:53:04 But even the 0.3% threshold of THC makes no difference. Indiana just legalized CBD oil. But I still have to disagree...some dispensaries do sell lower THC cannabis but again, unless it's a designer strain like Charlotte's Web, hemp is the only way to get rid of THC.

2079 2018-03-03 18:52:15 Made a 1pm appointment for an oil change. Arrived 10 minutes early. Was told that it will be 2 1/2 hour wait. Ummmmm....?!?!? If I wasn’t overdue, I would leave.
2080 2018-03-03 18:52:13 We gave our dog treats that had CBD oil in them when she had cancer. They seemed to make her more relaxed/comfortable, but she was also on painkillers, so it's hard to say what helped the most. But I used to work at a pet store & multiple customers had great results with CBD oil.

So it requires a PB..It could happen during march month & Crude oil could come down to 54.50/55.50 area to revisit during march month. That is the possibility to keep in mind.. Continue to stay below 60/62 is the sign.

2116 2018-03-03 18:46:57 .@KHarmDD59. Thanks Kat! But they are routing for you to import oil from a power!
2117 2018-03-03 18:46:56 One will play on the wing & I'd rather have RNH and his flexibility over a stand alone $6M winger....they already have one of those who isn't living up to expectations 
2118 2018-03-03 18:46:46 Lost land oil n gas when the countries annexed all that lovely tax ..look at how it screws with Poland..no surprise to statement..Dictator wants more ..
2119 2018-03-03 18:46:37 Pedro-Sale-Wake-Lowe-Oil Can. Fun, flashy, and entertaining.
2120 2018-03-03 18:46:29 Made an appointment for an oil change tomorrow afternoon. #GetshitdoneSaturday
2121 2018-03-03 18:46:19 So all this cuticle oil/cuticle creme talk with @JJBabbles reminds me I need to get more jojoba oil and lanolin 
2122 2018-03-03 18:46:19 Can't beat a bit of olive oil lmao. He does go a little ott with some seasoning tho
2123 2018-03-03 18:46:06 I have found using oil instead of moisturizer means that I don’t need to do it nightly. But for the sake of your poll: yes.
2124 2018-03-03 18:46:03 Today is the anniversary of oil discovery in Saudi Arabia. Oil was discovered in the historic day of March 3rd 1938 in Dhahran 
2125 2018-03-03 18:46:03 Not necessarily........
2126 2018-03-03 18:45:30 They are very good roasted. With just a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar!  
2127 2018-03-03 18:45:28 That oil change got me feeling like I can drive on top of water
2128 2018-03-03 18:45:27 Finally getting this well needed oil change for NuNu 
2129 2018-03-03 18:45:10 Ingredient Watch: Eating Propyl Alcohol this March? Used as a synthetic flavoring, it's made from natural gas and fusel oil.
2130 2018-03-03 18:45:02 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
2131 2018-03-03 18:45:01 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2132 2018-03-03 18:44:56 What a crock of shit ! The world is more than jobs and economics ffs ! Can you drink or eat oil ? No you can’t and if the Alberta Government really cared about people they would be investing huge in clean green renewable resource energy creating thousands of jobs ! #NoPIPEinBC!
2133 2018-03-03 18:44:53 Top4 looking like it could be harder task than we think. Especially after today results.  #CFC #KTBFFH
2134 2018-03-03 18:44:52 Unreal!! Foreign money to KEEP our oil in the ground, collapsing economies. We are a resource based country. Shut that down and you cripple the country.
2135 2018-03-03 18:44:51 I never said there was no trade in Africa before the Europeans arrived. I said there was no lucrative trade for oil, uranium, and yes, diamonds. Diamonds are the only one of these with any value before the 20th century.
2136 2018-03-03 18:44:37 That oil skin jacket is almost as greasy as his hair
2137 2018-03-03 18:44:34 The Shell Oil Company originally began as a novelty shop in London that sold seashells.
2138 2018-03-03 18:44:24 True, though the necessity of that scale of security is itself not unrelated to American gun culture.
2139 2018-03-03 18:43:48  time to add oil for the final push!!!
2140 2018-03-03 18:43:35 How much simple cleansing oil?
2141 2018-03-03 18:43:22 Getting my oil changed Thursday means I will potentially drive the extra 20min from the place to go to Joanns to see if they have different fabric for Enkidu...
2142 2018-03-03 18:43:20 Consider the following... The day America can produce the things it trades for will be the day America can turn the tables on trade. Unless that happens, America’s stuck trading grain and corn for good fruit, vegetables, tech, metals, and oil
2143 2018-03-03 18:43:12 Oil of oregano just raised the fuck out of my vibrations.

2145 2018-03-03 18:42:47 They've traded all the top guts they can trade. For me moving RNH for a winger would be insane...so they go from here.
2146 2018-03-03 18:42:45 Oil leak???
2147 2018-03-03 18:42:22 everybody knows that when DT talks the 'truth', a famous mouse whistles the #starspangledbanner
2148 2018-03-03 18:41:46 “Don’t get it twisted. I wake up next to a head scarf and coconut oil. I’m married to a black queen.” 

wow ... A MAN 
2149 2018-03-03 18:41:42 This dude in line in front of me arguing with the cashier about a $3 difference on the service fees for his oil change. Gtfoh bro. #nottuhday
2150 2018-03-03 18:41:34 ソレは思春期ダナじゃねぇええええええ！！！！！！
2151 2018-03-03 18:41:33 god bless peppermint oil
2152 2018-03-03 18:41:23 That's just it & they keep the protection of having 3 guys who could C top 2 lines if injuries hit. Strome has looked better at C all yr and I don't mind Khaira as a 4C.
2153 2018-03-03 18:41:17 They only came to prominence because they were too stupid to leave a city being bombed and got stuck there.
2154 2018-03-03 18:41:12 Jakobsen: “I firmly believe that the oil price over the next 10 years will be in a range between highs of $65 and lows of $25 a barrel, averaging $40 a barrel for WTI
2155 2018-03-03 18:40:58 Oregano oil.... fresh ginger tea
2156 2018-03-03 18:40:54 Sadly his drug of choice is the most addictive ever known… Arrogance!
2157 2018-03-03 18:40:48 I’ve been giving her hemp oil..yes it worked wonders!
2158 2018-03-03 18:40:41 the REAL PROBLEM with " the #conservative “movement” " is NOT the CONSERVATIVES ... it is the pathetic hoard of snake oil sales("persons") trying to profiteer off the angst of actual #Conservatives ... that's all about selling ads on talk radio or subscriptions or books or CLICKS
2159 2018-03-03 18:40:34 Girl, what would you do if I said your body was off the chain
And I told you I smile every single time I saw your face?
I ain't finished, bitch, I meant in half, oil the blades 
( eminem is so fucking clever )
2160 2018-03-03 18:40:26 ナルルちゃーん、俺の机ちょっと片付けて…くれないよねー
2161 2018-03-03 18:40:18 Salmond was right as proved by recent comments from EU leaders that scots will be welcome,,Swinney was right too,,massive new oil and gas fields on atlantic coast
That leaves you with "a ward closure",,,LOL
2162 2018-03-03 18:40:14 Who’s doing it ?? Or you’re doing it yourself. I’m buying vitamins to take and I’m going to do hot oil treatments and I just overall want a fresh start because my hair is not doing well
2163 2018-03-03 18:40:11 おっぱいって結局は脂肪だろ？少し胸についてるからって僕を巨乳キャラにするなよ。
2164 2018-03-03 18:40:11 Got some 99p beard oil from Savers and now I smell like a newly varnished floor.
2165 2018-03-03 18:39:48 the term "canola oil" is short for "Canada Oil low acid," a name coined to avoid the less marketable word for the product, "rapeseed oil"
2166 2018-03-03 18:39:39 People like Pruitt know better, they are just exploiting people's ignorance for personal gain. It's all about that sweet sweet oil and mineral money and it's disgraceful.
2167 2018-03-03 18:39:37 Dybala needs an oil can, or the Wizard of Oz. #rustyAF
2168 2018-03-03 18:39:19 ダリフラはホモでレズなんだぁ
2169 2018-03-03 18:39:12 Why does Midas/Jiffy lube always try to rebuild your whole car when all you need is a oil change. 
2170 2018-03-03 18:39:04 おはようございます、n星のカービィさん
2171 2018-03-03 18:38:54 where are you going to get a $150 oil change
2172 2018-03-03 18:38:43 Change your profile pic to show it off and I’ll donate
2173 2018-03-03 18:38:36 That damn Omega Oil!!!
The Jabari tribe was scheming from the get go!
2174 2018-03-03 18:38:23 I went on Starflower / Borage oil (for years) for completely different reasons, but once I came off it, I realised I got more coughs / chest infections. No real evidence to support that, but it worked for me. Expensive, tho. You could also just throw some salt over your shoulder!
2175 2018-03-03 18:38:22 They r protectors of their own interests and they r Syrian government ally. US also doesnt care about Kurds. Tillerson meeting showed how they would gladly share Manbij with Turks.  US can do a lot but they rather choose to defend oil fields
2176 2018-03-03 18:38:16 I don't disagree on the 1st point but don't think it's a matter of having Lucic look good. He's going nowhere anytime soon and they can't have him & his $6M hit be of no use. Too many other holes to fill.
2177 2018-03-03 18:38:15 you realize there is more to bc then just the greater vancouver area right? and that almost all the rest of the province supports the pipeline.. also the oil is still getting out.. just on trains and trucks.. which is alot more dangerous then a pipline.. fucking hippies
2178 2018-03-03 18:38:14 They really don’t u deestand abot the tax regime, or about the decommissioning and other costs NS oil companies can offset against tax.
2179 2018-03-03 18:38:02 LISTEN there's this oil thing my friend uses that stimulates hair growth and he was afab but ! he's growing a beard
2180 2018-03-03 18:37:54 but wait if we did that then identity couldnt be used as a qualification and my white card wouldnt get me out of prison on murder or free oil changes
2181 2018-03-03 18:37:52 Of course there is but you make history in football by predominantly winning trophies which City struggled to do before oil money came in
2182 2018-03-03 18:37:48 Just make your own! And don’t forget the oil butter and cheese!
2183 2018-03-03 18:37:47 Sry puri garu oil lekunna puri veyyochu ani nijamga thelidu
2184 2018-03-03 18:37:42 Haha yeah tbh After Casino Night, the rest of the tracks don't sound as inspired as S3&K to me.. And I don't like Oil Ocean's music, but that's just me
2185 2018-03-03 18:37:39 I’m hugely interested in studies like these as my sister is expecting and I’M GOING TO BE AN AUNTY!! I’m trying not to bombard her with everything I read as she’s only 15 weeks pregnant. I’ve limited myself to fish oil in pregnancy
2186 2018-03-03 18:37:37 you'll be surprised how often it's the simple things. Once had a customer warranty call out for his pump, it was leaking oil everywhere. Told him to stop putting oil in it, it's grease lubricated.
2187 2018-03-03 18:37:37 We noticed it took you five days into the strike to notice, and you still haven’t explained it fully—few have. Confluence of health care costs, union rights, oil & gas monopoly on government, not to mention women organizing
2188 2018-03-03 18:37:21 Trump only has time for golf and multi million dollar snake oil salesmen
2189 2018-03-03 18:37:19 Love your tweets - this one made me laugh
2190 2018-03-03 18:37:18 they didn’t mention it, i know that coconut oil isn’t always the best for people with oily / acne prone skin though as it can clog pores which will cause more breakouts!! X
2191 2018-03-03 18:37:15 The tax is on PROFITS. NS oil companies have a lot of costs to set against profits. Ergo, little tax to be paid. It really is quite simple. It’s NOT the same for fracking. No rigs to decommission. Got it now?
2192 2018-03-03 18:37:10 Mfs been gettin the brakes and oil changed for 6months now huh? 
2193 2018-03-03 18:36:31 It’s much each easier to change the oil on a Taurus than on a F-150 or Altima even with the hight
2194 2018-03-03 18:36:12 We still are net importers of crude oil even with our higher production
2195 2018-03-03 18:36:08 Oh I understand! They look nice swatched but look like a crunchy oil slick mess on my lids. I can’t get a duo chrome to look like a duo chrome either! It’s not a disability! If it is we can be together. 
2196 2018-03-03 18:35:56 If tight oil is this bad what to make of tight gas? (the stuff they flare in the Bakken)

Good for laundering investment losses into well placed pockets, but otherwise good for nothing.
2197 2018-03-03 18:35:47 The United Nation should insist with west to divide the income of oil on the basis of the number of the citizen in the east,west,and the south and forget about the Islamic political party and start for reconciliation between the east and the west
2198 2018-03-03 18:35:24 I once did a very rough calculation of man's annual CO2 emissions from coal/oil/gas consumption and it came to ~3% of atmospheric CO2.
2199 2018-03-03 18:35:22 I think im gona try the homemade one. Ill try the brown sugar and coco oil 
2200 2018-03-03 18:35:13 

2201 2018-03-03 18:35:12 Hey, can I have some oil, dis bitch is thirsty
2202 2018-03-03 18:34:59 97, 29/93, 18 is a pretty decent 3 C approach too. And you'll have at least one 1st line W this way to boot.
2203 2018-03-03 18:34:30 I don't get it. Puljujarvi has never played LW. And he's not a goal scorer shooting on his off wing (that's Slepyshev) but I digress.

They are hellbent on making Lucic look good and they're only compounding the issue on the ice, in the room, and with fans.
2204 2018-03-03 18:34:26 Still though... Sonic 2 has the most iconic music where as, Sonic 3/K just has Ice Cap Zone. Great track, but that's the most memorable next to Sky Sanctuary and Lava Reef.

Sonic 2 has CPZ, CNZ, Metropolis Zone, Mystic Cave, Aquatic Ruin, Emerald Hill, Oil Ocean, etc.
2205 2018-03-03 18:34:22 Little common courtesies [like “thank you” and “if you don’t mind”] oil the cogs of the monotonous grind of everyday life...

2206 2018-03-03 18:34:16 The place I go to get my oil changed doesn’t make me get out of the car, which is perfect when I don’t really want to put on real clothes.
2207 2018-03-03 18:34:16 Unparalleled, really! The Presidents in the past that have been shot and assassinated, was that nothing compared to Trump? Your dad pushed the whole birther movement, he has attacked everyone. You are a family of grifters, snake oil salesmen and slumlords.
2208 2018-03-03 18:34:10 I know there's Extra Virgin Olive Oil, but what if I wanted Extra Sluty Olive Oil?
2209 2018-03-03 18:34:06 zoë’s a puppy but I give her CBD oil everyday for the health benefits. Helps anxiety and fights cancer. They also come in biscuit form. 
2210 2018-03-03 18:34:01 It’s the anointing of the oil that covers me! I WILL survive!  @earnestpugh @imkeithwilliams #survive
2211 2018-03-03 18:33:48 Spanish Chorizo,Greek Olive oil,Parmesan cheese,Iberico ham,Dijon Mustard,French Cognac,Belgian chocolates,Amarone,Barolo,Rioja,Burgundy,Cote du Rhone,Brie,Manchego,Feta,German Riesling,pimenton,Padron peppers,Colatura,mojama,memembrillo,Manzanilla,Arborio rice,La bomba rice,Port
2212 2018-03-03 18:33:45 They really charged me $150 for a oil change

#mhw #モンハンワールド
2214 2018-03-03 18:33:40 Where do you want me to start about lies? Salmond on EU membership, Sturgeon on non closure of RAH ward or Swinney on an "Oil Boom"
2215 2018-03-03 18:33:33 NOTE TO SELF. Don't drink chili oil, ever again.
2216 2018-03-03 18:33:32 There are longstanding problems in Venezuela to pretend that all was milk and honey before Chavez is a lie mistakes were made but much has been achieved. Sanctions and talk of invasion will help no one but war profiteers and oil barons.
2217 2018-03-03 18:33:31 You can eat  Etta Mae, just not the whole cake! Everything in moderation including coconut oil on your body
2218 2018-03-03 18:33:26 Honestly think this will likely be the way it goes w/ Lucic on their wing. Still gives them the option to run the 3 down the middle or Leon w/ McDavid when need be. Find 97 a winger & put Puljujarvi on the other side.
2219 2018-03-03 18:33:12 Russia did this for many reasons. To make Turkey leave Nato would be 1st prize. But main goal is to stop US of making border army and to regain oil fields 4 Syrian government. They also want to alienate Ypg from US showing them how they look as an ally when there is need 4 help
2220 2018-03-03 18:33:09 I have asked you to point to what is baseless....
How much was in Nigeria reserve when GEJ took over in 2010?
How much left when he was leaving in 2015?
How much did he sell crude oil for 5 years of 2.2million barrel daily?
So let me repeat it: NO project to justify the loot...
2221 2018-03-03 18:32:59 Guess what happens when we want to bomb a place, we just yell ISIS and get the green light from everyone and people are completely fine with it. Don't be fooled so easily, civilians die by the masses everyday due to the US, and why? Money and Oil!!!! Open your eyes people
2222 2018-03-03 18:32:46 Let them fry in their oil.
2223 2018-03-03 18:32:42 Pro tip: coconut oil is an excellent lubricant for sex…
2224 2018-03-03 18:32:38 JAJAJAJAJAJAJAJA EL DE LA OIL ME AGREGÓ A SNAP 
CRACK 
2225 2018-03-03 18:32:36 Trump would say he’s quixotic.  And Wilbur Ross’s miniature commerce lesson was symbolic of the Great Depession when people heated soup in open cans over a fire in an oil drum.
2226 2018-03-03 18:32:24 Did a lovely mixture of coconut oil, rose water and pepper mint
2227 2018-03-03 18:32:22 Talk with your Vet, do your research, ask lots of questions, and find a reputable source. CBD oil from hemp can be awesome. It's worked great for my old guy! We use HempRX but there are other great companies using organic, no residue, no pesticide hemp extraction. Good Luck!
2228 2018-03-03 18:32:21 Ha! I also got the midnight recovery cleansing oil (I love oils) and I don’t know where it’s been my entire life
2229 2018-03-03 18:31:59 This oil burner be having my house smelling all heavenly and stuff
2230 2018-03-03 18:31:45 AND EVEN HEAVY HIGHLIGHT OIL SLICK LOOKS BETTER THEN OILY SKIN OIL SLICK
2231 2018-03-03 18:31:37 @realDonaldTrump Not to cause alarm, but it feels as if Kim Jong is directing his threat at you personally. Immediately eat a lot of brown seaweed 3+xdaily (eg dulse), maybe green too & continue this. Also get YARROW essential oil or flower essence and align with it. Renelle /SA
2232 2018-03-03 18:31:26 I remember Drai RNH and Maroon being pretty good in a short sample size last season.
2233 2018-03-03 18:31:18 Since #neonics ban, UK farmers spray at least twice with #pyrethroid insecticides to establish oil seed, that's instead of using a single #neonic seed dressing which doesn't become air-bourne.
It's just irresponsible for the environment not to consider the relative impacts
2234 2018-03-03 18:30:59 مجموعتي الفخموميه دخلت برايم #حياتك28
2235 2018-03-03 18:30:54 This is the worst about oily skin like if I wanted to look like an oil slick I’d wear heavy highlight.
2236 2018-03-03 18:30:37 One thing i observed common about snake oil / service sellers is. 
1) they all pretend to be humble and non bully
2) All pretend to be non negative and stay positive life to show how good they are.
3) all block those who ask questions.
4) They are all good marketers.
2237 2018-03-03 18:30:25 Hi Oil, pilih kamu aja gimana?
2238 2018-03-03 18:30:23 The latter better not be a serious option to start the year.
2239 2018-03-03 18:30:18 Kurds in #KRG have had enough! 1. Block pipeline to Ceyhan which exports iraqi oil. 2. Close all water dams. 3. Boycott Iraqi par & elections. 4. Redeploy peshmerga to frontlines. If #Iraq -i gov is not ready to accept KRG the way it is now then just seperate! #TwitterKurds
2240 2018-03-03 18:30:13 Nobody’s going to spend half a trillion on rebuilding Syria. Not enough oil for an ROI even if Assad was replaced.
2241 2018-03-03 18:30:08 I dont see the oil finishing over 80 points, but i do expect them to beat the flames this week. Regarding Khaira on wing, what are your thoughts on putting him at 3C? 97 and either of 93 or 29 being the other.....
2242 2018-03-03 18:30:07 Kwani Simmers ni ya Wakenya wote? That is a private property and it is a private matter. Wacha umalaya wa Twitter na huyo Raila wako mzee!
2243 2018-03-03 18:29:52 Be careful, @justinbbradford is a snake oil salesman of the highest order
2244 2018-03-03 18:29:49 Correct and then we will decide to become an independent country again ! And we will be taking our oil with us !
2245 2018-03-03 18:29:49 There is hardly any coverage about what's happening in Venezuela ???? Or else every mainstream coverage is actually really hypocritical attributing everything happening to the oil price drop ???
2246 2018-03-03 18:29:36 “Money is a form of communication.” - Edward Snowden (@Snowden) at #BlockstackBerlin

If true then #EarthDollar based on love and the preservation of all life is a beautiful message.

If a currency is based on oil, fossil fuels and war, what type of message are we sending?
2247 2018-03-03 18:29:32 so husbro left the lights on after he used the car again
pops is out there jumping it but he came in and was like, you're low on oil, it's knocking 
a) no it's not, i check it regularly, and b) what you mean by knocking could be anything, i need to be out there to listen to it
2248 2018-03-03 18:29:27 Oil of Olaz
2249 2018-03-03 18:29:12 I need some bio oil! 
2250 2018-03-03 18:28:50 I could do with that to check the oil on the car
2251 2018-03-03 18:28:43 The economy is recovering in spite of them . They have done nothing to encourage growth. The only reason we're doing better is the price of oil, that's it.
2252 2018-03-03 18:28:32 It’s truly a blessing to have curly hair. I haven’t had a haircut in almost 4 weeks. All I gotta do is smack some coconut oil in my hair and throw on the Burberry scarf to cover the lineup and I’m good to go.
2253 2018-03-03 18:28:22 Hence my 2nd point about the Rangers not being very good 
2254 2018-03-03 18:28:06 Never get Lavender oil in your eye....your face will die
2255 2018-03-03 18:27:58 Oil lekunda asalu how it is possible to make puri sir
2256 2018-03-03 18:27:42 No quite true. Both Marijuana and Hemp can have pesticides as both can be grown organically and tested for chemicals. Find reputable companies, work with your Vet and do your research. THC in CBD oil can cause problems for older dogs. HempRX has helped my old guy immensely!
2257 2018-03-03 18:27:39 Leo went to baff in the oil
2258 2018-03-03 18:27:32 I have had the WORST customer experience today with @LithiaLasCruces I've been waiting 4...FOUR hours for an oil and filter change....FOUR hours all he can tell me is he's running around.  I don't care what you are doing! How is MY time being compensated????
2259 2018-03-03 18:27:32 While I get many want Oilers to run w/ the 3 centre approach come next season but unless they magically find a bunch of cheap wingers who can produce, 97, 29, 93 will be used in the T6 more often than not...and it could end up being RNH w/ Draisaitl & not McDavid.
2260 2018-03-03 18:27:27 I wish I can pay someone to bring my car to come get an oil change etc...
2261 2018-03-03 18:27:17 Poni puri with oil aa without oil aa
2262 2018-03-03 18:27:10 نحب نشكر الشتا إللى جه متأخر ومشى بدرى وماقرفناش فى النص.. طلعلى الtanning oil مالدرج 
2263 2018-03-03 18:27:10 Just watch as #Oilers piss away another prospect with mismanagement, improper development and lack of quality playing time. #Slepyshev When will it end?
2264 2018-03-03 18:27:05 Roll the cooked peas into balls and squash a bit. Lightly dust in flour, then batter (I just use beer and flour) and fry in a few inches of oil
2265 2018-03-03 18:26:45 Pasta n Veggies: cook normally then sauté (til a little crunchy) in olive oil. Any pasta. Any veggie.
2266 2018-03-03 18:26:41 I used to make my stovetop meats with veggie oil instead and I switched over a few months ago. Sorry if I’m late!
2267 2018-03-03 18:26:40 ไม่มีน้ำใจก่อนก็จะมาหาว่าใจดำไม่ได้ไม่พูดแต่จำและมันจะเป็นอากาศ
2268 2018-03-03 18:26:38 I Hate baking pancakes from now on because the oil just burned my face #dutchPancakes
2269 2018-03-03 18:26:36 Great, how about oil companies? Seen Venezuela lately Mr, Vice President?
2270 2018-03-03 18:26:35 Guys, these are so easy to make :) and taste amazing! I use coconut oil to fry.
2271 2018-03-03 18:26:32 finally got an oil change thank gawdddd
2272 2018-03-03 18:26:18 Chapathi with oil tintava without oil aa
2273 2018-03-03 18:26:11 Just how socially inappropriate is it to spray other people with Thieves Oil? ... Asking for a friend. #contagion
2274 2018-03-03 18:25:59 That quote should be inscribed on a stone slab and placed outside Lucas Oil stadium (where the combine is held every year).
2275 2018-03-03 18:25:27 I tried to boycott Palm oil. It’s in everything. I need to try harder.
2276 2018-03-03 18:25:17 Aw shit dawg, I needa take my car to get an oil change 
2277 2018-03-03 18:24:48 im trying to use on of those oil blotting sheets but nothings on the sheet itself?????
2278 2018-03-03 18:24:48 @jatinshah1986 which oil were you us g before and after GST. Looks like you shifted from Griundnut oil to Asli ghee. Don’t lie!
2279 2018-03-03 18:24:46 Ex.of waste Pruitt protects:fracking waste, groundwaterN OK being destroyed.OK AgriDept worried;oil owns OK. @ScottPruittOK @HardballChris
2280 2018-03-03 18:24:41 Your timing on these tariffs is horrible.  These projects may disrupt several large projects in my industry (oil and gas).  You are protecting 140,000 coal jobs but jeopardizing millions of other jobs.
2281 2018-03-03 18:24:35 Add tomato sauce, cumin, Adobo, garlic and black beans to your rice cook that shit up real nice. Season your chicken with salt cumin Adobo paprika, (chili if you like it spicy)cook that shit over some medium heat with a lil oil cut it up mix it up bam. ¡Fiestá en la boca!
2282 2018-03-03 18:24:35 much of the trade deficit has been oil imports, balanced by the petro-dollar and US carrier battle groups protecting saudi. Green Energy ends this
2283 2018-03-03 18:24:27 US corn production = $14.5B per YEAR.    US oil production = $18B per MONTH
2284 2018-03-03 18:24:20 @DiBellas gotta love when your sub has three things(turkey cheese and oil) on it and you still get it wrong...
2285 2018-03-03 18:24:13 The tax from oil must be worth it, seeing as WM are happy to allow fracking for the oil, which is less cost effective than conventional methods of extracting oil
2286 2018-03-03 18:24:11 @PutinRF Saudi Arabia is an important hub for Russia and Saudi Arabia helped Russia to raise oil prices and improve the Russian economy, as well as sales of Russian weapons should be a source of financial income to Russia in the future
2287 2018-03-03 18:24:01 @MedvedevRussia Saudi Arabia is an important hub for Russia and Saudi Arabia helped Russia to raise oil prices and improve the Russian economy, as well as sales of Russian weapons should be a source of financial income to Russia in the future
2288 2018-03-03 18:24:00 Reminiscing this and that and having such a good time, oodelally, oodelally, golly what a day.
2289 2018-03-03 18:23:59 Yessss lol be like “baby it’s red because this oil represents passion” 
2290 2018-03-03 18:23:47 Decided to leave work today ii needed to get a oil change and my car inspected
2291 2018-03-03 18:23:39 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
2292 2018-03-03 18:23:30 But we won’t be spending on many of the things we are currently billed for. This year Norway made £130 billion from their oil fund. By not being independent we have £0.
2293 2018-03-03 18:23:19 Cooking with olive oil >
2294 2018-03-03 18:23:12 The guy from Honda hooked me up with a free oil change looking all fodonga 
2295 2018-03-03 18:23:11 My hairline was suffering as well, especially after getting styled last year  so I mixed my jabu stones spray with water( the green one, it made my hair a bit dry) and also added Jamaican castor oil, I see progress
2296 2018-03-03 18:22:58 May want to check the oil as well.
2297 2018-03-03 18:22:53 So I’m getting my oil changed and the guy seriously asks me “do you know how to pop your hood?” ...
2298 2018-03-03 18:22:51 Forgiveness is the oil marriage runs on. #FamilyLifeWTR
2299 2018-03-03 18:22:37 Unfortunately, it is the other way round. I can talk forever about the unbelievable funds and oil stolen from Iraq.
2300 2018-03-03 18:22:37 Yeah i see that now, she say she didn't like hearing me slamming my hood early in the morning having to  put oil & transmission in my truck 
2301 2018-03-03 18:22:25 you know what I thought of thats a bomb ass idea too? putting it in a massage oil 
2302 2018-03-03 18:22:22 How can you say that with a straight face when the oil industry has been classed as a low priority. Your constituents have been classed as low priority.
2303 2018-03-03 18:21:57 "Have you changed the oil in your car recently?"

"When was the last time you went to Costco?"
2304 2018-03-03 18:21:57 I think you mean it is the US led economic sanctions crippling Venezuela because Chávez dared to bring the oil industry back into public ownership
2305 2018-03-03 18:21:52 You can last about a week without potable water.  Without oil?  A lifetime.
2306 2018-03-03 18:21:46 Expect Newcastle to open up like the oil in the salad in second half searching for the equalizer! Perfect chance for our fab 3. Firmino and Mane must get their act together! Have been disappointing in first half!
2307 2018-03-03 18:21:38 I'm rubbing tissue oil on my own booty. Imagine.
2308 2018-03-03 18:21:37 My weed guy just offered me moon rocks which is cannabis bud dipped in hash oil and rolled in kief. It's official weed is now crack.
2309 2018-03-03 18:21:24 寝よう (-_-)zzz
2310 2018-03-03 18:21:17 Oh poor you. I’d go tea tree oil or bio oil every couple of hours if you have any handy.
2311 2018-03-03 18:20:55 I cannae stop thinking about this. The baby oil bill itself would be astronomical
2312 2018-03-03 18:20:54 toothache potion:

- 1tsp ish (eyeball it) of *pure* vanilla extract
- 10 drops peppermint essential oil
- 15-20 drops clove essential oil
- 1.5 ish ounces of warm water

shake to blend, soak a cotton swab, apply to painful area & hold the swab in your mouth for a few minutes.
2313 2018-03-03 18:20:51 My dog was prescribed HempRX CBD oil by our veterinarian. She used it on herself first to see if it helped her MS symptoms. I'm using it now and he is seeing the benefit!
2314 2018-03-03 18:20:47 Happy Birthday to Mr Oil
2315 2018-03-03 18:20:43 Let them. Then embargo all oil and gas. Cut it off at borders.
2316 2018-03-03 18:20:39 Sickens me to see this beautiful land turned into an oil field. Once more to line the rich mans pockets. Is there no end to this awful?
2317 2018-03-03 18:20:32  Nag champa oil too
2318 2018-03-03 18:20:29 This will likely be the night Lucic breaks out w/ a Gordie Howe hat-trick. He'll have a dance partner in McLeod, the Ranges aren't very good & he's more than overdue. #Oilers
2319 2018-03-03 18:20:24 US having trade deficit in Dollars is like S. Arabia having trade deficit in oil.
2320 2018-03-03 18:20:21 Ahahaha. Yeah. Cheese in a can, fish oil in a bottle, tide pods and nuclear weapons. Bad mix
2321 2018-03-03 18:20:18 Do we want to engineer society so that more young woman take jobs in the oil and construction industries?  Maybe. If your goal is equality over personal preference and self determinism, then I guess so. I believe social equality is a scary goal because the terms are ill-defined.
2322 2018-03-03 18:20:11 One of my FAVS!! 
2323 2018-03-03 18:20:10 Wow what's a great thread... At the moment I've stopped twisting and styling cause my hairline was suffering so I just stopped. I oil my hair with Jamaican castor oil and alternate with water. Ive been locked for 2 years now. I think patience is key and letting go of lock envy.
2324 2018-03-03 18:20:08 If your beard oil is so good give it to your homegirl and let’s see if works on her
2325 2018-03-03 18:20:05 i walked into jiffy lube for an oil change and theres a dog that keeps tryna jump at me 
2326 2018-03-03 18:19:46 Amen!! 
2327 2018-03-03 18:19:44 I'd be way more for arming lunch ladies than teachers. They already have boiling oil at their disposal.
2328 2018-03-03 18:19:41 The tariffs will kill our oil and gas industry in TX!  Please do not do this!  We are just recovering from the Obama fiasco!!!
2329 2018-03-03 18:19:38 Got all my supplies for my next round of soap making. This next venture will be hemp oil & cocoa butter                
2330 2018-03-03 18:19:33 Stop being a closet wrestling fan, come out and embrace the Lycra and baby oil
2331 2018-03-03 18:19:28 Are you planning to remain dependent on oil for eternity?
2332 2018-03-03 18:19:08 @Oil_Guns_Merica has been to our place on Padre Island, on the boat, and is a full-grown Petroleum Engineer now. Let the air our of him all you want.

2334 2018-03-03 18:19:00 of ALL palm oil. There was no palm oil in any products before late 90s. Humans have always lived without it until 20 years ago. & in 20 years wiped out Indonesian forests & animals just to put it in everything. BOYCOTT ALL PRODUCTS WITH PALM OIL IN THEM!!!
2335 2018-03-03 18:18:56 Baby oil to remove black marks left from patches is very good

2340 2018-03-03 18:18:16 Excellent article, thanks.
I've been saying all along it is about Russian oil. Carter Pages idiot persona is a show.
2341 2018-03-03 18:17:57 Mix ingredients well (spoon or mixer)
 Split into three balls
If dough seems wet add a little more flour, if dry add oil

Light coating of oil on each ball. Refrigerate at least 4 hours. If in a hurry leave at room temp for two hours
2342 2018-03-03 18:17:56 When you see a weak foreign country that has a rich oil supply
2343 2018-03-03 18:17:53 Soon the Markets and investment community will dump this loss making exploitation of shale.....and oil price will head towards $80-$90/bbl...
2344 2018-03-03 18:17:24 I asked him, is that CBD vape oil ? he laughed and said no. Never seen him without a cheeky smile, jumps around like a teenager; pity he fell out with the other guy who lives near by, haven't seen him for weeks. Maybe he thought I was undercover squad.
2345 2018-03-03 18:17:23 CBD oil works as medication on practically anything with a spine because anything with a spine has an endocannabinoid system which directly regulates immunity. It'll work perfectly on your dog. Better than any other medicine as a matter of fact. Strength to your little buddy.
2346 2018-03-03 18:17:19 When you pick up your vehicle from the oil change and they tell you “literally everything is leaking haha”.....sweet.
2347 2018-03-03 18:17:16 So you believe the credibility of the half life of the carbon isotope. What is the half life of something that never disappears?
A brand new tennis shoe is made with some petroleum products. Using carbon dating is the shoe brand new or as old as oil?
2348 2018-03-03 18:17:13 Girls spend their money on the most unnecessary stuff. Like literally " I got essential oil infused matches!".....yes that helps because I often do light match and leave them out rather than lighting the candle.
2349 2018-03-03 18:17:09 No they probably wouldn't have but my point isn't about teams like them and city being in the PL it's what City's achieved after oil money
2350 2018-03-03 18:17:03 All mining takes a toll on the environment and I think all sensible harm reduction methods should be used. Only small amounts are used on some wind turbines and it can now be recycled. Compared to coal or oil use its clearly far less harmful and needs far less land.
2351 2018-03-03 18:17:02 Hemp oil is fine for pets
2352 2018-03-03 18:16:58 Boat
2353 2018-03-03 18:16:57 Free trade and negotiations is the only way to keep prices down.not tarrifs.we the people dont want to pay more than we have to now.gas prices are artificially inflated now.we should not be paying the ridiculous prices since big oil is exporting our rescorces
2354 2018-03-03 18:16:48 Yes, they could & they are doing so in CNY.  So if we put these tariffs on & they stop buying our USD-denominated oil, that will further reduce global need to stockpile USD's, putting further fiscal pressure on the US gov't & bring forward faster the day USD resserve status ends
2355 2018-03-03 18:16:47 Thats a good point Bruce. Of course it looks like Slepy has been demoted now that RNH is back. Why wouldn't you put Drai on a line with Lucic and McDavid?
2356 2018-03-03 18:16:36 Hemp oil is fine for pets
2357 2018-03-03 18:16:14 Slice thinly, soak in milk, dredge in flour, fry in oil, drain well, season with salt....perfect snack to give you an excuse to drink a rum and coke.
2358 2018-03-03 18:15:59 You know youre a simple man when a new set of tires and an oil change makes you feel like you won the lottery
2359 2018-03-03 18:15:52 Pipelines are the most efficient method to move oil  Less energy is required compared to trucking the oil. Pipelines are “green “.

2365 2018-03-03 18:15:26 anybody know how to change oil? Don’t all speak at once
2366 2018-03-03 18:15:19 Your outfit is telling me that my oil change will take 3 hours instead of 30mins
2367 2018-03-03 18:15:19 This cbd oil tastes TERRIBLE. This shit better work or I’ll be ANNOYED
2368 2018-03-03 18:15:02 Oil is just a bonus,are you saying the snp spread lies?
2369 2018-03-03 18:14:47 Can I just say that the new head and shoulders argan oil is absolutely fabulous I've used many shampoos for dry frizzy hair and they've only lasted a couple of washes but this argan oil has lasted @Headshoulders
2370 2018-03-03 18:14:45 When you take your car in for an oil change and they find over $1000 worth of things wrong >>>>>>>>
2371 2018-03-03 18:14:26 I remember when i was younger this nigga i didn’t like tried to force me to jack him off & i put a candle fragrance oil on my hands and rubbed it and his dick started burning and he was running around talking about wtf wrong with your hands 
2372 2018-03-03 18:14:21 @MedvedevRussia The Russian alliance with Saudi Arabia in cutting oil production should continue to work to raise oil prices
2373 2018-03-03 18:14:14 Not any more it isn't. All these boring, featureless teams that no one gives a shit about, while the likes of Forest and Villa rot in the second division. Meanwhile the oil clubs play pass the parcel with the title amongst themselves.
2374 2018-03-03 18:14:13 These aren’t facts. They are just meant to divide and distract. Environmentalists are passive by nature-wouldn’t hurt a flie. Big oil uses BS like this to convince us to keep allowing them to rape our resources and in doing so, us too. Check out The merchants of Doubt- great doc
2375 2018-03-03 18:14:13 @PutinRF The Russian alliance with Saudi Arabia in cutting oil production should continue to work to raise oil prices
2376 2018-03-03 18:14:03 I get Oilers fans want to see RNH w/ McDavid and it'll happen before the yr is out but McLellan made it quite clear Nugent-Hopkins would start where he usually plays...as he should. Once he's back in game mode, he'll get a look w/ 97
2377 2018-03-03 18:13:59 Acupuncture really helped in combination with CBD oil. Our vet also makes house calls for the acupuncture(in LA).
2378 2018-03-03 18:13:56 Another one who's swallowed the "Oil is just a bonus" nonsense from the SNP. Do you want to buy some snake oil?

2380 2018-03-03 18:13:44 Yeah, he's not stuck in the minors like Mironov. Last time I checked he was on a line with Connor F. McDavid
2381 2018-03-03 18:13:43 I get my favorite essential oil when I fry bacon. 
2382 2018-03-03 18:13:41 Fukin Synthetic Oil prices got me appalled
2383 2018-03-03 18:13:37 You don't like palm oil in your chocolate, make a stand and dont buy NESTLE. If you think Wenger is continuing threat to arsenal, dont buy arsenal products or tickets. Not because we're losing but because its a protest, Wenger never touched a fanny though, so might not happen.

2387 2018-03-03 18:13:28 it makes three 16" pizzas. You can store the extra two in the fridge up to 2 weeks or freeze

2390 2018-03-03 18:13:02 I googled about cbc oil said it's safe for dog's
2391 2018-03-03 18:12:57 Don’t listen to this person. Most pet CBD oil is hemp-derived. Don’t use THC. I use the hemp CBD with all three of my dogs (two are senior) and was able to take one off rimadyl, which she’d been taking daily for years.

2395 2018-03-03 18:12:05 I hate having to come get my cars oil changed bc I know nothing about any of that
2396 2018-03-03 18:12:02 Found a minor oil leak in my engine today but since it hasn’t caused any troubles yet, guess that’s to be dealt with another time. Ignorance is bliss.
2397 2018-03-03 18:11:41 Or.....artificially hiking oil prices yet still over spending meant economic ruin was as certain as a Ross Ford overthrow.
2398 2018-03-03 18:11:41 Sir, Respectfully... CBD oil is a alternative to fighting pain. Please let Dept of Veterans Affairs use this alternative.
2399 2018-03-03 18:11:34 This is BS. Most of the Pet CBD oil is hemp-derived. It works wonders. Your advice is actually the opposite of facts!
2400 2018-03-03 18:11:32 coconut oil is really good, at least for my hair-- leave it on for 30 min on oily hair before showering and you can wash it off when you shower
2401 2018-03-03 18:11:26 What about FurryFree for those that wax....and oil. Dubo.

2406 2018-03-03 18:10:23 What you gonna do about Canada? You know that country right above you that you get 38% of your oil from along with natural gas, electricity, water and lumber? How much you think you're gonna be paying now for that shit, or you gonna rely on Russia for it?

2421 2018-03-03 18:08:43 The smell of oil and bread 
2422 2018-03-03 18:08:17 You need to make sure its full spectrum oil. Cbd is great for many maladies, but you need the THC content for fighting cancer - you need full spectrum not just Cbd.

2425 2018-03-03 18:07:46 I mashed one banana first. I personally like to use them once they're a little more ripe because I feel they cook better then. & then add in 1 cup whole wheat flour, a little salt and sugar, 1 tblespn of vanilla & oil, 1 egg & 1 cup of milk
2426 2018-03-03 18:07:33 I’m going to do that today... my hair soaks up oil or anything for that matter smh

2429 2018-03-03 18:07:17 @brandonstinney  Why won't the Senators who are representing me in Charleston answer my question about whether or not they received any money from oil and gas??   I bet @Ojeda4congress will give me an answer and he's not even in my district. @SenatorKarnes @gregboso

2432 2018-03-03 18:06:50 @CogginHondaJax Made a 1pm appointment for an oil change. Arrived 10 minutes early. Was told that it will be 2 1/2 hour wait. Ummmmm....?!?!? If I wasn’t overdue, I would leave.
2433 2018-03-03 18:06:49 Also I was surprised the massage oil melted into my skin, I was expecting to come out sticky
2434 2018-03-03 18:06:40 Is it fake news? Why would anyone go half way across the world to get palm oil to put in my desert if we have got perfectly good veg oil? Its illogical.

2440 2018-03-03 18:06:05 Need to re-up on some more Jamaican Castor Oil.
2441 2018-03-03 18:05:56 Social Media doctors are the best doctors? Much better than  snake oil,  tv, or  witch doctors! I personally recommend medicinal cannabis! It cures what ails you n make the day very enjoyable! 
2442 2018-03-03 18:05:45 Good to see Bong Quinto of Letran and Jovit Dela Cruz playing well for Batangas and Bulacan respectively. I used to watch them at the Fil Oil Flying V Preseason Cup circa 2010 onwards when i buy season passes. #MPBL
2443 2018-03-03 18:05:34 Please divest our money from fossil fuels.  You are failing to protect us from the predatory behavior of the oil companies by not doing so.
2444 2018-03-03 18:05:32 I hope these kids take on the oil/gas industry next!
2445 2018-03-03 18:05:21 the docs gave me an antibiotic solution that i use every morn / night and i honestly haven’t had a spot since  i also have a fair bit of scarring so i’ve started using pai rosehip oil and use it with body shop aloe vera and it’s helped so much!!!
2446 2018-03-03 18:05:12 Well someone's triggered and can't handle the truth that City would be nothing without their reserves of oil money

2454 2018-03-03 18:04:23 My car is covered in oil from this roll over  I’m glad the driver is safe.
2455 2018-03-03 18:04:13 Castor oil is a better alternative for coconut too to use on skin issues. Has the same properties.
2456 2018-03-03 18:04:06 This makes *excellent* sense. I keep and rotate thru an emergency pantry of dry goods: rice, beans, grains, tuna, pasta, can veg, flours, oil, plus a spare freezer of meats, veg & homemade meals. There's pet food & water too. We have ample crisis supplies for at least 45 days.

2460 2018-03-03 18:03:47 A supertanker can carry as much as 747,000 tons of oil.
2461 2018-03-03 18:03:38 Only privileged kids at university could think up such nonsense. Safe spaces indeed! Tell that to lads on building sites, oil rigs, or to anyone doing dangerous work. Manual workers would laugh with scorn.
2462 2018-03-03 18:03:36 How am I supposed to get an oil change with no filter???? 
2463 2018-03-03 18:03:35 Doesn’t Condi have some fake WMD’s to sell to some gullible GOPer or giant oil company board to sit on somewhere? She should be thanking her lucky stars that the DJT dumpster fire is elevating the awfulness that was 43’s admin from history’s wall of shame.
2464 2018-03-03 18:02:57 I tried CBD oil for my anxiety and it barely helped me. My anxiety level was way too high for CBD to help at all tbh
2465 2018-03-03 18:02:54 At least CNN doesn't sell snake oil vitamin supplements.
2466 2018-03-03 18:02:51 Almond oil too!
2467 2018-03-03 18:02:50 So what will the US do if Canada puts a massive toll on all roads in and out of Alaska and massive tariffs on US gas and oil pipelines and charges super tolls for transit thru the St Lawrence seaway? Airspace can also be taxed costing huge fuel rises.
2468 2018-03-03 18:02:36 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.

2470 2018-03-03 18:02:31 Today on the IT social media scene, the buzz remains the same: all big data is oil, all AI is evil, and all the kids are above average.
2471 2018-03-03 18:02:28 Why the fuck were people drinking olive oil and why the fuck did I take a little bit also

2477 2018-03-03 18:01:30 "keep the olive oil in place anytime anywhere" is my favorite. That's just good advice.
2478 2018-03-03 18:01:29 Look around you. Much of your life is made from synthetic materials. Even if every vehicle is not a combustion engine machine we will still be extracting oil. Which will be even more lucrative for processing to chemicals.
2479 2018-03-03 18:01:11 Looks amazing!
2480 2018-03-03 18:01:08 On the condition that @Kurdistan #KRG contributes a daily average of 250K barrels of oil within its current fields.. which might not be possible due to KRG’s commitments to international traders for advance sales from 2017 & other prepaid deals
2481 2018-03-03 18:00:50 Just listened to it. She mostly talks about the importance of mustard oil in some Indian cuisines; I don't hear her saying that "For many centuries, the main hotness in Indian food came from #mustard not chilli."
2482 2018-03-03 18:00:41 Red. But every few months oil change & then they find other things  never fails
2483 2018-03-03 18:00:36 coconut oil is GREAT for skin. not for your face tho.
it help psoriasis, eczema, and cellulitis since it’s a anti fungal and anti bacterial. especially after a hot shower.

2494 2018-03-03 17:59:11 Which is needed to prevent their fuel/oil/water/Blackwater lines from freezing. Not to mention keep the crew from freezing. 

But if they don't like noises from ships maybe a condo next to the port isn't the best choice?
2495 2018-03-03 17:58:36 This is a fact lmao tell me why I took my perfectly running car to get the oil changed and the next week they told me I got a gas leak? Had to sell the damn car

2503 2018-03-03 17:58:08 There's plenty of oil left. It's just that oil isn't bringing in any income just now. You do know that the only income from oil is from TAX on company PROFITS, don't you?

2529 2018-03-03 17:54:54 Totally with you Charles. USA has been abused for years with unfair trade tariffs etc against our goods.  Time to stop it.  I’m with Trump on this.  If we are not self sufficient in oil, steel, aluminum, uranium etc then we have no sovereignty and no security.

2531 2018-03-03 17:54:37 Qatar largest US military base in the Middle East , Trumps yet Trump sides with Gulf states , claiming its funding terrorist . So do the Gulf States. Bogus claim. It’s about oil & Qatar’s economic advantage

2533 2018-03-03 17:54:33 Yes, I can say oil is my bff also..however, I could oil some more.
2534 2018-03-03 17:54:26 It's a leader who will acknowledge climate change is a danger, but still demand oil pipelines be built.

2539 2018-03-03 17:53:26 Getting an oil change for the first time since I interviewed for the job in September. Yes, I realize how long it’s been. I’m doing it now because the last thing I need right now is car trouble.

2541 2018-03-03 17:53:24 I always fuck up and put too much oil in my hair before straightening it, now it’s flat af and shinier than a bitch
2542 2018-03-03 17:53:11 cbd oil tastes so rank ew ew ew help
2543 2018-03-03 17:53:11 I really want my people to do better and stop using coconut oil in their hair and on their skin.
2544 2018-03-03 17:53:02 i tried for the first time today wiith Sesame oil for 20 min. There is no need to use toothbrush. Just let it stay and enter the teeth slowly.. swishing it intermitently.. at 20 min spit out. didnt feel any effects of the oil in the mouth. Gargle with salt water,then brush
2545 2018-03-03 17:53:00 I gave this nigga my card AND CAR to get my OIL CHANGED
2546 2018-03-03 17:52:59 Sane!
2547 2018-03-03 17:52:59 Baby oil johnson wq
2548 2018-03-03 17:52:57 That was nice. Now plant based nutrition and cannabis oil and Bob's your uncle.
2549 2018-03-03 17:52:54 You are a miracle. Every day you are alive in Ke is a miracle. No one swapped your head for surgery. You're eating sewage vegetables, transformer oil fries & your teeth are intact & white. Clap for yourselves. That guy that said, "Cha muhimu ni uhai" should be our brand manager.
2550 2018-03-03 17:52:42 I swear I just brought my car to @Nick_Offerman to get my oil changed

2553 2018-03-03 17:52:14 @SecretaryZinke Specifically lied to the American people and the people of Utah. Emails show that oil and gas were the first, middle and last concerns when it came to changing Bear’s Ears national Monument. He said exactly the opposite ON CAMERA at Bear’s Ears. RESIGN!
2554 2018-03-03 17:52:08 Do you know how to reset your "oil chng due" warning? Turn on key(not to start) then press the gas pedal to the floor 3X within 10 secs. Turn off key.
Your welcome!
2555 2018-03-03 17:52:01 Parah ya emang manjur bener ini essential oil. Kemarin tengah malem gue buang-buang air dan baru bisa tidur jam 5 pagi. Pas bangun tidur perut sakit dan badan lemes. Oilnya dioles ke perut dan gak lama perutnya tenang gak berisik lagi trus badan jadi enteng.
2556 2018-03-03 17:51:59 Dat zou Big Oil eens moeten doen... Dan zou de wereld te klein zijn!
2557 2018-03-03 17:51:33 The fact that Calgary was suffering because the Oil prices were 26.00 a barrel does not even come to his mind? What?
2558 2018-03-03 17:51:31 The brine seems to almost pull the oil to the surface of the asphalt and leave it a slimy mess. You can really notice it where tire tracks intersect each other. The @CityofEdmonton has dropped the ball on this crap experiment
2559 2018-03-03 17:51:31 I am going to recommend you stop the teeth whitening process for a while until you feel better, then reintroduce it gradually if you'd like to see if maybe you're accidentally swallowing too much of that oil. Some things, good in small amounts, become toxic in larger doses.
2560 2018-03-03 17:51:30 Oil change, headlight bulbs replaced, car washed & vacuumed in this glorious sunshine. Wish I could take the bus to work, but a 35-minute bus transfer wait in the dark in a not-so-great uncovered location eliminates that as an option until summer.
2561 2018-03-03 17:51:29 He'll be telling us we need oil to make whisky next. 
2562 2018-03-03 17:51:23 You know a true nigga if he don’t use cologne but he uses body oil lmao.

2564 2018-03-03 17:51:05 Dear car,
I know you want an oil change. If you could hold out until the week after the week after session, I would be immensely grateful. Here is one quart of oil as a truce?
-me
2565 2018-03-03 17:51:03 Baru beli td,oil cleanser n moisturiser...hrp2 ok..
2566 2018-03-03 17:50:59 On this day in 1938, oil was discovered in Saudi Arabia. 
#OnThisDay
2567 2018-03-03 17:50:54 Detroit auto makers going to electrics in 7-8 years. This kills big oil. The tariff is meant to punish auto makers who get their steel and aluminum from Canada.#Kochs
2568 2018-03-03 17:50:54 I would not mind enjoying the profits that the oil companies stuff their pockets with, who do they answer to when they suck out that
" free oil".
2569 2018-03-03 17:50:41 My mum uses coconut oil already. X
2570 2018-03-03 17:50:35 Tonight is the night! Shine your shoes, pull on your foam fingers, put your @MOBHockey gear on and head to the Casman Centre for tonight’s @TheAJHL action. Tonight the Oil Barons draw for the Dream Home by Cherrywood Homes! #checkyourtickets #winnerwinner #GoBarons #MOB
2571 2018-03-03 17:50:35 You're now confusing geology with astrophysics.

Geologists accurately predict the size of oilfields based on seismographs. If you ever used oil or gas, that's thanks to the scientists you don't believe in.

See?
2572 2018-03-03 17:50:29 coconut oil & lavender >>> 
2573 2018-03-03 17:50:29 มีแน่นอนเจ้าค่ะ
2574 2018-03-03 17:50:27 Come to mines and rub oil over me bro
2575 2018-03-03 17:50:25 I just watched #TheGreatestShowman as a sing along @cineworld #1sttime I love the choreography the costumes.. I could go on.. I mean I loved everything. I'm sentimental romantic and musical theatre floats my oil tanker 
2576 2018-03-03 17:50:21 Definitely not! But their lavender scented gun oil will make your Glock smell very soothing
2577 2018-03-03 17:50:09 最近日の出る時間に起きて無理せず10時間位で仕事切り上げてるけど、少しずつ体調良くなってるし体力が戻ってきてるのが分かる
2578 2018-03-03 17:49:59 Probably go get me an oil change some time this week 
2579 2018-03-03 17:49:53 Well fossil fuels were expended in charging the battery so maybe oil is still relevant... 
2580 2018-03-03 17:49:47 So that is good for EU otherwise that 3 million refugees will end up in the EU streets where they actually wanna go. When will you get it, no1 gives a shit about u Kurds if u dont have oil or fight for them as a mercenary. Stop #pkk first then blame Turkey.
2581 2018-03-03 17:49:46 As far as i understand it was about Gas not Oil.
2582 2018-03-03 17:49:43 Lmfao $175 for an oil change.  WHAT A JOKE.
2583 2018-03-03 17:49:34 started using argan oil on my face again instead of lush moisturizer bc idk wtf lush specializes in but it’s not skin care
2584 2018-03-03 17:49:31 my nose and t zone r fucking oil central and no matter how much I set my face the foundation just slides right off 
2585 2018-03-03 17:49:30 @PiaggioOfficial hi what Hub Oil should be put in a 2017 Piaggio Typhoon 50cc 2 Stroke??
2586 2018-03-03 17:49:29 Yep there is a graph rhat shows the highet the support for independence the less oil there is.
It runs out in 5 years when support reaches 50%
2587 2018-03-03 17:49:26 Oh dear me, isn't your chairman an oil rich Russian
2588 2018-03-03 17:49:19 I did want to say 'much of the media' but couldn't due to word limit. Of course, one should never generalise! But "much of the media" indeed does not and this only adds oil to fire.
2589 2018-03-03 17:49:16 オイルの気持ちにもなってよ…
2590 2018-03-03 17:49:13 i walked into the oil change place and happened to bump into my aunt and she gave me a 20 and told me to put it towards my bill today... absolutely going to pay it forward today
2591 2018-03-03 17:49:10 Oil (thankfully) didn’t work out so let’s focus on healthcare.
2592 2018-03-03 17:48:54 I tried oil pulling for the first time. timed it for 20 min. Not as gross as it sounds..
2593 2018-03-03 17:48:52 Roommate has a dog oil/treat CBD company. LMK if you'd like a sample package.
2594 2018-03-03 17:48:51 I put rose hip oil on my face and wow I am THAT BITCH
2595 2018-03-03 17:48:48 Look at all the oil leake spots. Is that your parking spot. Hahahah
2596 2018-03-03 17:48:35 Yes, our 12yr old labradoodle gets CBD oil with every meal for arthritis. This replaced a Vet-prescribed anti-inflammatory which worked great but could no longer take due to liver disease. Not as effective maybe but helps. All our dogs also get Norwegian Kelp for healthy coats.
2597 2018-03-03 17:48:31 残念です
メタルだとOILに鉄粉混じることが多いと思いますよ！
2598 2018-03-03 17:48:10 I want to do some event that time.  To teach the snake oil vendors of #MarketProfike that if they can't make money thn stay at home and get a 15i loan to make pakoras bt don't spoil a technique just cz you survive by selling it to morons who pretend to be experts on Twitter
2599 2018-03-03 17:48:08 Coconut oil been repairing my hair beautiful.
2600 2018-03-03 17:47:56 Hopefully you are not in this oil pit of corruption! There’s a storm coming to Oklahoma. Corruption will be exposed.
2601 2018-03-03 17:47:56 Mr President please tell these critics that the free market no longer exists & hasnt for a very long time due to multinational corporations buying up commodities in multiple nations. They control the market the same way opec does with oil!! These people are not living in reality!
2602 2018-03-03 17:47:45 Nothing like having a Nintendo Switch while you wait for ur oil to be changed
2603 2018-03-03 17:47:36 To all of my female friends, I’m sorry I did the thing that makes us look like a “typical female” inside of AutoZone just now. I was going back and forth between O’Reilly, AAP and AZ’s websites to figure out which oil was best and AAP had a 25% off coupon.
2604 2018-03-03 17:47:21 Oilを垂らしてくれ 軽蔑に値する
2605 2018-03-03 17:47:11 ARGAN OIL
2606 2018-03-03 17:47:09 Just watched #beforetheflood with #dicaprio & is a really powerful documentary about the environment, did not know the destruction that palm oil plants can cause #Indonesia
2607 2018-03-03 17:46:58 I was supposed to get up at 8 to get my oil changed but SOMEHOW i managed to snooze all 8 of my alarms, who let me try to be an adult???
2608 2018-03-03 17:46:54 Tissue oil will be your best friend 
2609 2018-03-03 17:46:45 I agree we should grow more of our own food locally. The problem is how, and how long it will take to do so.  We already produce 49% with 30% from EU. Oil seed is just 10% of croppable area. Too simplistic to think this would be a solution.
2610 2018-03-03 17:46:40 rig count at record level .USA becoming # 1 producer and exporting both oil and LNG which displace oil .  . Supply is twice than last year and price is 40 percent more . Inventory is being drawn as as spread was high  now it has come off . Price will drop
2611 2018-03-03 17:46:39 Ive had to fam at the smoke alarm for 20 minutes because oil got on the bottom of the oven while my muffins were baking and I was not going to stop baking them
2612 2018-03-03 17:46:37 PF is a lot more of a gym than that. Try Curves.
2613 2018-03-03 17:46:33 I agree, did this trade help your team succeed ? how to measure this ? did they make the playoffs if that player helped impact your playoff chances then yes you won the trade. Pretty simple and another thing yes it will swing year to year. Mcdavid and the oil are far from done.
2614 2018-03-03 17:46:26 Nice! I remember when they were originally made in Britain, leaked oil all over the place, snorted fire and were beautiful still.
2615 2018-03-03 17:46:24 Time for car wash and oil change
2616 2018-03-03 17:46:22 Oklahoma is corrupt. How can you explain failing schools? 
And at the same time Giving huge tax breaks to BIG oil companies?  Where’s the loyalty? If they want the oil they will drill. The days of giving lobbyists their way and taking donations are over!
2617 2018-03-03 17:46:22 Why haven’t I been using tea tree oil on my face sooner? That and thayers witch hazel has been making my face look amazing I’m shook rn
2618 2018-03-03 17:46:15 And that doesn't include the defence costs associated with the Middle East, which follow on from the need to secure oil supplies for the west
2619 2018-03-03 17:46:12 At the dealership walking around while I’m getting an oil changed. Looking at the Dodge Challenger missing having a sports car, but high key a Wrangler is the best investment I ever made!
2620 2018-03-03 17:46:11 Me too, I would use oil instead of powder.
2621 2018-03-03 17:46:10 @Omicrono_oil  hey Omicrono there's something i need to talk to you, private message me if you can please
2622 2018-03-03 17:46:03 Thank you Google for translating Extra Virgin Olive Oil as अतिरिक्त कुंवारी जैतून का तेल 
2623 2018-03-03 17:46:00 Lalu bwh i dh buat and apply tyt oil already. No progress makin naik gelembung air tu. Besar duit 50cent ;(

2625 2018-03-03 17:45:50 At the risk of sounding dumb, what's CBD oil? My brother has cancer so I wonder if it would be helpful to him. How do you give it to your dog?
2626 2018-03-03 17:45:49 do transformers have to get their oil changed? when they race each other is using stuff like power steering fluid a performance enhancing drug?
2627 2018-03-03 17:45:29 With an improper amount of oil, it's Slatheryn
2628 2018-03-03 17:45:21 i have to get my oil changed which i do not want to do someone come do it for me
2629 2018-03-03 17:45:11 Sean, it means this is what he’s paid to do. It means that the oil and gas industry want him to say that. It means he is trying to shore up support among evangelicals. It means he is running for his life. It means he wants a job after he is fired.
2630 2018-03-03 17:45:09 My son’s off on a play date for the next four hours, this would be a good time to make love to my girlfriend!

• gets oil change

• washes and details vehicle 

• goes grocery shopping

• simultaneously weeps and                       masturbates
2631 2018-03-03 17:45:08 A country that produces 2m barrel of crude oil per day just boasted yesterday of being world highest petroleum importer,
The country is called Nigeria.
So do you see why @realDonaldTrump is right about Africa?

2635 2018-03-03 17:44:11 My dog was diagnosed with a really aggressive cancer in January of last year and given 4-6 months, he's still with me over a year later because of CBD oil. My vet is shook. 
2636 2018-03-03 17:43:56 I need for this oil change to be done soon so I can go hangout with people before I'm stuck lesson planning all day.
2637 2018-03-03 17:43:51 Do it! My cat eats CBD for his shoulder arthritis. Just watch out for THC content in all the CBD stuff. Just a little thc is better 5 mg max depends on weight! Read the label on what you buy. CBD oil is wicked misrepresented in the markets.
2638 2018-03-03 17:43:47 Indonesia menempati peringkat 1 dalam produk pertanian,

The rest are only good to supply Foolanis with  Oil & Human Resource via NYSC.

Apart from violence what does South get from North?

2644 2018-03-03 17:43:05 Zinke specifically said that these changes to Bear’s Ears had nothing to do with oil and gas. His emails prove that he was knowingly and blatantly lying to the American people and the people of Utah.
2645 2018-03-03 17:42:55 Tis indeed!  Extra Virgin Olive Oil ranks up there too.
2646 2018-03-03 17:42:50 Gender issues, MeToo issues, equal pay for women, invitations to Atwal in India and meanwhile NO OIL, NO PIPELINES, INCREDIBLE DEBT IN 2 YRS, LESS FRACKING, NO COAL MINES WHEN THERE ARE SCRUBBERS, INVESTORS FLEEING, MORE THAN

2647 2018-03-03 17:42:45 ... clean oil (5th use with 7 more in them if you don't fuck it up) from plantains, fried cheese and fish. Throw it away: die. Ruin it: die. Touch it: wish you were dead.
2648 2018-03-03 17:42:44 By reducing dependence on oil & coal fired power generation from 20% to 2%, New England faces power shortages WHEN THEY NEED IT THE MOST - DURING STORMS!
2649 2018-03-03 17:42:40 CBD OIL!
2650 2018-03-03 17:42:34 The white man that are paying the millions for amisom are not doing it out of love for Somalia. But to have enough peace to steal oil.
2651 2018-03-03 17:42:30 Ewww....protein shake burps AND fish oil burps!   The velocity must be on the other end!!  
2652 2018-03-03 17:42:25 I don’t feel like going to get this oil change 
2653 2018-03-03 17:42:23 Our Government is being mocked all over the world.
Our journalists are recording it for a historical cautionary tale on how a con man bought his way into our people's house backed by corporations, big oil, big pharma, NRA, and supported by Russia, Turkey,  Saudi Arabia, etc etc

2659 2018-03-03 17:41:45 The get-rich-quick shiny object scam, #donthecon's world, now corporate HR policy.  Snake oil salesmen rule.
2660 2018-03-03 17:41:45 It’s just so hard to be an oil company these days.
2661 2018-03-03 17:41:43 I was thinking this person deserves a spot in Hell and the devil should take the oil as fuel...
2662 2018-03-03 17:41:22 I did the velocity diet once (basically protein shakes and fish oil)  and that fucking sucked

2665 2018-03-03 17:40:55 En petroleras me banco todo 2018. Creo q será el sector más productivo. Hay estabilidad en el oil y muchos países creciendo producción además de una demanda sostenida firme por China y US.
2666 2018-03-03 17:40:27 Because they're still active mines. They're saying they are reclaiming the areas that have been mined already. Plus modern oil sands technology far from "ravages" anything.
2667 2018-03-03 17:40:20 Hehe!  It's a hard habit to pick up, especially the last one, but I am definitely seeing the benefits. All meat is cancerous. All wheat has been sprayed with Glysophate. And the amount of GMO palm oil that's in our foodstuffs is ridiculous. Have you heard about the nanotech?

2669 2018-03-03 17:40:00 Does he have his experience with Crohn's patients, epilepsy patients etc. using coconut oil? Is he successful in revesing such conditions? I doubt.
2670 2018-03-03 17:39:59 It seems like a lot for the arguments about how Norway should be considered socialist due to the government's role in the economy and the citizens benefiting from state owned oil wealth also applies to Iran.
2671 2018-03-03 17:39:53 Still in shock that i never went home from last night  woke up at my friends and went straight to pick up my car and now I’m at my oil change appointment HAH
2672 2018-03-03 17:39:45 One of the "activists" trying to get justice for the Grenfell victims was previously caught making cannabis oil in one of the flats. He was using butane gas from cylinders in the flat. Had also been to prison for a £1.6m credit card fraud.
2673 2018-03-03 17:39:15 logisch toch. Stoppen met shale gas and oil VS verhoogt mondiale olieprijs en daarmee inkomsten Rusland
2674 2018-03-03 17:39:03 The funny part, is that older conservatives used to be more skeptical of charlatans trying to sell them snake oil. Now, Trump has made them more relevant than they have ever been. Or at least that is how they imagine it. 
2675 2018-03-03 17:38:35 Such a dick... lol
2676 2018-03-03 17:38:25 even if its mostly oil thats okay, the tiniest amount if you tilt the pan is enough to spoon up, but its all about finding what works for you ;w;
2677 2018-03-03 17:38:07 On this day:
-1924 : The Ottoman Caliphate (Empire) is abolished.
-1938: #Oil is discovered in #Saudi Arabia.

2679 2018-03-03 17:37:47 You couldn't be more wrong. 1st of all it's not used to "create" the oil. 2nd of all it's pronounced "oil sands". 3rd of all natural gas is cheaper than dirt, and oil is valuable.

2683 2018-03-03 17:37:17 If the Syrian children were to bleed oil, the World would rush to their rescue.
2684 2018-03-03 17:37:10 I should clarify my comment, the puppet masters who control both sides of the argument. That said, Jason is absolutely right about Yankeeism and Dixieism being diametrically opposed. There is no peaceful blending of oil and water.
2685 2018-03-03 17:36:55 I thought so. I’ll send you a nice recipe x
2686 2018-03-03 17:36:50 Ayo for all the men out there that shave on the regular put olive oil on your clippers & wash your faces with lemon grass water... Your welcome fam.
2687 2018-03-03 17:36:43 Bears Ears National monument has Native American ceremonial lands and archeological sites. Trump shrunk Bears Ears National Monument to access its oil. This is disgusting. We are STILL ruining the land of Natives even after all these years. Some things never change.

2690 2018-03-03 17:36:16 Hm, will an inch and a half of oil be enough to get through to Thursday? Asking for a friend...

2696 2018-03-03 17:34:47 Ok GOP Senators (Drennan) told us Big Oil and Gas would never go for a severance increase without co-tenancy. Senate majority just passed co-tenancy. Time for Sb 486! @Ojeda4congress will you try to discharge it in light of these new changes??
2697 2018-03-03 17:34:42 I’m not dismissing the idea that consumerism pours oil on the fire. But I think the crux on the probably is cognitive dissonance based on a cultish heightened irrationality- back to square one and the word I used to characterize it.
2698 2018-03-03 17:34:28 Almonds instead of flour?

2702 2018-03-03 17:34:02 Went to the Boston game two weeks ago and the lack of effort just about made me throw up. You could even tell in warm ups that Boston had swagger and the Oil were already beat.

2711 2018-03-03 17:33:03 Let’s hope the Iraqi government isn’t going to steal all that oil money in there own pockets and leave Iraq infrastructure as it is with false hopes & corupted false projects like in Maliki time were 500B were stolen during his 8 years as the P.M

2720 2018-03-03 17:31:53 Its on the internet- then it must be true. did CIA force Chavez to forcibly nationalise large parts of industry and run the oil industry putting good Marxist party members in charge? No. If true it would show how thick Corbyn et al have been praising this dire system.
2721 2018-03-03 17:31:43 Me too! Sanggup beli sbb baru tahu cleansing oil more effective! Niat nak beli biore punya tpi tgk ada alcohol. So i take simple!
2722 2018-03-03 17:31:37 I gave my baby boy Raylan, an 8yo Ragdoll cat with heart disease, VetCBD Oil for his annual trip to the vet, which causes him extreme anxiety. It definitely helped calm him down, he didn't go to the bathroom like he usually does, the vet was impressed.
2723 2018-03-03 17:31:20 Thanks Steve, miss simpler times when support meant just that, but significantly inflated prices, trying compete with oil clubs, dble whammy

2725 2018-03-03 17:31:17 My mom is worried about medicinal cannabis oil getting her high even though her doctor was enthusiastic about it.

She pets her dog, watches Gunsmoke, eats lunch with her friends and does yoga. Not sure what part of her day cannabis won’t improve.

2727 2018-03-03 17:31:00 recently i really enjoy to draw with oil/chalk alike brush but it is quite a challenge for pursuing the details
2728 2018-03-03 17:30:53 A taste for fine art perhaps, the equivalent to us having an oil painting on our living room wall?
2729 2018-03-03 17:30:43 You'd think oil companies would have enough experience with terrorists (in the mideast) to know the difference.
2730 2018-03-03 17:30:35 Use the oil or treats that have it in them?
2731 2018-03-03 17:30:33 They will.  The guns are the rattle, but the snake is oil.  Where is Tillerson, Zinke, Perry, Pruitt?  They left their beast here according to the weather, and our children are in danger. Look at the big picture, and know the climate has changed.  Its about control now.

2743 2018-03-03 17:29:00 Every prediction he’s made on the price of oil over the past 20 years has been wrong. He’s been so wrong so often he’s become an excellent contra indicator.
2744 2018-03-03 17:29:00 dumping not legal according to WTO, lack of foundry/manufacturing in your country is a national security disaster waiting to happen. Coal & iron ore in plentiful supply no need to import, just like oil & fracking.

2750 2018-03-03 17:28:17 Was it found though because Indonesia is destroying its rain forest thru deforestation to meet demand for Palm Oil trees We need an awareness n targeted campaign against huge corporations sourcing this palm oil @Leemary
2751 2018-03-03 17:28:15 How do arrive at that figure? Listen carefully: Tax. Is. Levied. On. Profits. Made. By. Oil. Companies. When companies can offset substantial costs against profits, there is very little tax revenue. Have you got that now?

2758 2018-03-03 17:27:39 This leaves me to wonder how the water supply in Midland, Tx is probably affected since a majority, if not all, of the big oil and gas companies have operations there. Especially fracking operations.
2759 2018-03-03 17:27:37 I’ll never forget when I replied to 1 of his tweets re: Bush’s oil war. I told him I lost family in that war. He RT’d me and called me a man. Belittled my loss.

2773 2018-03-03 17:26:37 @KoosJansen: 

1) Right now there are ~10 tons in total registered inventory at COMEX, that's about $420m.  That's <0.1% of daily FX volume.

2) Ask Saddam about "freedom of choice about which currency to settle one's oil in."  His opinion would likely differ from yours.

2795 2018-03-03 17:23:37 If you look at the dates most of these Enviromental groups started it was about a year after hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling made shale oil and gas accessible.This in turn changed the US from being dependent on Canada’s oil and gas to become our competitors in energy
2796 2018-03-03 17:23:24 Sir Assam is also blessed with natural gas and oil but due to some morons, Assam can't developed in this field. So I place a humble request to you as a Indian citizen for taking this seriously so that new generation of Assam can also develop themselves for better placements.

2800 2018-03-03 17:22:58 USA interests push for tariffs on steel and bombardier in an effort to block us access to their market and the feds go nuts, foreign interests try and block us from getting our oil to offshore markets and they do nothing.

2806 2018-03-03 17:22:39 Folks don’t use palm oil because they want,they have no choice it’s the only oil they can afford,working in the palm oil industry maybe their only source of income.Unless those core reasons are addressed it’s just another story telling time!

Pull out, let most of the water drip, then squeeze, and the milk will come out. For oat cream, I add melted coconut oil & a little honey. You need an emulsifier to
2808 2018-03-03 17:22:31 ...maintain that more people have woken up to the ramifications of checking out and not voting, and that trump’s populist bs tapped into a disgust and great demand to course correct the trajectory of our politics. He turned out to be a snake oil salesman, but that doesn’t...
2809 2018-03-03 17:22:31 In regard to that specific picture though, it’s may be the first example of someone standing up to his bullshit.  Trump is a hotel only in Vegas because they wouldn’t grant him a casino license. Because you know, they don’t give those to snake oil salesmen.

2817 2018-03-03 17:21:38 The guns are the rattle, but the snake is oil.  Where is Tillerson, Zinke, Perry, Pruitt?  They left their beast here according to the weather and I fear we have reached a run away situation.  Do all you can now, cause there is no time left.
2818 2018-03-03 17:21:37 #Zinke is criminally responsible to big oil and gas industry. He'll be paid off by #Exxon

This is the problem with the church today  you’ll walk around like “devil you can’t touch me , I bought the biggest Bible” “my pastor is dripping with oil.” And the devil is saying “IM COMING “

2825 2018-03-03 17:20:28 When I was a kid and really bored I would pretend a motherboard was a country with green terrain and the sockets were buildings and the cylinders were reservoirs and oil tanks and the circuitry was the roads
2826 2018-03-03 17:20:27 Yeah, it is what it is, though. What parts of Canada are more conservative? I know like Alberta is cause of all the oil and whatnot, but I thought as a whole you guys are more progressive
2827 2018-03-03 17:20:17 Loool. I already did it but i put my stock first before the oil. It came out bomb. Thanks b.
2828 2018-03-03 17:20:17 Everyone: Noel, why do you prefer eating out instead of cooking?
Me: Well, when I go out to eat, I don’t splash myself with boiling oil

2830 2018-03-03 17:20:08 I put a shit ton of coconut oil in my hair last night and now I don’t have the energy to wash it out
2831 2018-03-03 17:20:06 Not these kind of quantities of gold. China buys 8mln barrels per day. That's 11 t of gold per day or 4000 t per year. World produces 2200 tonnes of Au annually. Nobody wants yuans for their oil. Gold is perfect, but until now countries were afraid buying it in large amounts.
2832 2018-03-03 17:19:42 Are you trolling or just actually retarded  city have literally bought the title... you probably was a Chelsea fan until that oil money came in  Pep Guardiola has already spent 448 million in just 18 months
2833 2018-03-03 17:19:35 Especiallygiven at this one they are passing MCT oil rather than ethanol. Medical profession take notice 
2834 2018-03-03 17:19:30 i went to pep boys for an oil change and got yelled at by the dude for not knowing what to do:(
2835 2018-03-03 17:19:29 I HAVE TO WAIT 2 HOURS FOR AN OIL CHANGE????!?!?? brooooooo I am sick and deceased. I just wanna get home to play fortnite with the boys.

2839 2018-03-03 17:19:19 Daily oil production in $ terms is 20x daily gold production in $ terms - a problem if gold settlement for oil starts. The new Shanghai Yuan oil contract and the SGEI physical gold platform allow rapid conversion of payment to physical gold. Repricing of gold perhaps. Let's see.
2840 2018-03-03 17:19:01 watch me aggressively rub white spirit into my long since dried out oil paints because I don't have the will to mix these colours again

2845 2018-03-03 17:18:36 Terrence, What is your choice? Canada’s Gay friendly oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off Buildings. Protesting #KMX = killing #lgbtq Do you buy Blood Diamonds because you think Africa has better enviro regs than Canada?

2856 2018-03-03 17:16:46 Simple solution really. Build a pipeline, take oil of the tracks, and there will be plenty of capacity to transport grain. #cdnagmatters
2857 2018-03-03 17:16:37 USSR resurrection is impossible with an economy that has no diversity and relies heavily on oil exports. That’s why you lost the Cold War Bitch!

2860 2018-03-03 17:16:26 this grown ass woman was finna cry cause she thought they didn’t change her oil after waiting 2hrs 
2861 2018-03-03 17:16:19 A crisis will force this I think. Probably climate change or a lack of oil. Maybe both.
2862 2018-03-03 17:16:14 Yes! CBD oil, and I have my dogson on a diet of homemade meals. Brands I use CW and Jambo foods. I mix it in with al little Tahini.
2863 2018-03-03 17:15:56 Uncle Wilbur Ross (Commerce Secy.) says not to worry. That we are making much about nothing

2869 2018-03-03 17:14:42 Oh really how are they going to get the public lands that zinke is selling the oil and gas and how are they going to stop the spraying of pesticides that Pruitt is allowing now there's no reversing that
2870 2018-03-03 17:14:39 I see that although not one of the 'Seven Sisters', Total is now one of the world's seven 'Supermajor' oil companies.
2871 2018-03-03 17:14:34 Omg I been in here 2 hours waiting for a damn oil change

3. Turn on your bluelight filters and/or night mode over an hour before you want to go to bed.

2881 2018-03-03 17:13:09 1.059 at the Balzac gas station where I get it. Still though it's .85/L CAD in Montana, 25% cheaper.  

We get half as much for our oil and pay 25% more for our gas.
2882 2018-03-03 17:13:08 I been so lazy about getting an oil change I hate it so much 
2883 2018-03-03 17:13:07 Ada lagi yg berdebat sunflower lebih ramah lingkungan dibanding palm oil. Packing ah. Pindah gw ke Mars.
2884 2018-03-03 17:13:07 What oil is it mark ?
2885 2018-03-03 17:12:48 I'm sure their public infrastructure would be fine were it not for their economy relying on a now-crashed crude oil price. They're nearing early-2000s-Zimbabwe levels of inflation.

But I bet their bus system is still running...
2886 2018-03-03 17:12:47 I really wish I could say I have one I don’t. I only do the basics, everytime I undo my plaits I shampoo and condition with Organics products, I moisturise with Dark n Lovely naturals butter and lock in the moisture with coconut oil. That’s pretty much it really
2887 2018-03-03 17:12:40 It is great from them especially if your dog shall health issues, bigger breeds and older dog can benefit greatly from it...my dog had a seizure a few days ago and scared us half to death and CBD oil has helped , she also has hip issues and anxiety the CBD oil helps with it all

2891 2018-03-03 17:12:11 Allow the Chinese to destroy our steel and manufacturing industries, rely on countries who want to destroy us for our oil, defund our military and anything else Obama tried to do while president should be on the list too.

2924 2018-03-03 17:08:07 tip 1: remember to check your oil hasn't run out the coldest week of the season, when clearly hundreds of other numpties ran out too, and it'll be 10 days before they can get to you. 
There you go Lucy ----^--- top tip.

2932 2018-03-03 17:07:13 Thanks Robert.  For academic reasons I maintain an interest in the oil industry.  Seem to remember Total was previously Compagnie francaise des petroles, one of the collection of companies that owned Turkish Petroleum before in 1929 it was renamed Iraq Petroleum.
2933 2018-03-03 17:06:57 Unbelievable.

2937 2018-03-03 17:06:30 The smoothness in one’ life has always been the result of the measure of oil bestowed on him. #Mercy
2938 2018-03-03 17:06:26 Everyone is saying @realDonaldTrump said nothing about Putin's new weapons, but the fail to make the connection to Tariffs.

2945 2018-03-03 17:05:24 Hi Gwen - Ventura County takes the position that it is legal due to "vested rights" the oil companies have with their old land use permits.
2946 2018-03-03 17:05:22 Just noticed that my local coffee shop offers the option of adding CBD oil to your tea
2947 2018-03-03 17:05:15 Lol leave the sinking man
2948 2018-03-03 17:04:57 I also like to put coconut oil and tea tree oil on pimples bc it dries them out :-)
2949 2018-03-03 17:04:53 whenever i take Tacoma for an oil change and they ask for the mileage i always give a fat shrug and point at the broken odometer. today i said “just give it a round 220,000”
2950 2018-03-03 17:04:40 Came to give my car an oil change like an adult.
2951 2018-03-03 17:04:34 Simple cleanser, use it with a cotton pad morning&night - use to clean face/remove makeup

Rosehip/Argan oil around eyes 
I don’t suffer with acne this just helps with my wrinkles/bumps!
2952 2018-03-03 17:04:21 @svaneksmith What supposed to happen if you touch raw oil?
2953 2018-03-03 17:04:13 I've been curious about that for 17+ years. Seems some combination of banks, oil/chemical companies and war profiteers actually run the US.
2954 2018-03-03 17:04:12 The soup of garlic and mercera and onion oil are smelled ★ Fried rice 600 g

2956 2018-03-03 17:03:58 Tea tree oil/ heavier oils too? Every 3days...maybe this winter more often ?
2957 2018-03-03 17:03:48 ตัดหน้าม้าเสร็จก็ได้แต่ปลอบตัวเองว่า เดี๋ยวมันก็ยาวเนาะ

Quebec township of 157 people was facing a million-dollar lawsuit from an oil and gas exploration company, after it created a no-drill zone, fearing for its water supply.

2976 2018-03-03 17:00:59 In the absence of a proper regulatory framework the cbd oil mkt remains something of a lottery - but some research should lead you to the better products, even if not 100%. Im not able to make recommendations.

2986 2018-03-03 17:00:08 Washing your car at home allows grease, oil, metals and chemicals to flow into storm drains causing environmental pollution. See us instead!
2987 2018-03-03 17:00:08 You probably remember your oil changes, but don't forget about your filters! Dirty filters can increase your fuel usage by as much as 10%.
2988 2018-03-03 17:00:02 Expect.... not to have to send America’s military off to fight wars in the Middle East to protect oil supplies. Expect... many good paying jobs in the “ American “ energy industry.

2992 2018-03-03 16:59:01 Sitting here getting my oil change and a few of us are talking about our shoulder and hand injuries
2993 2018-03-03 16:58:58 There you go again with “confiscate”.
Is that what Churchill did with oil?
2994 2018-03-03 16:58:56 You don’t get it. Scotland is much much more than oil. Oil is a bonus - not a necessity for a strong independent Scotland.
2995 2018-03-03 16:58:55 Deep!
2996 2018-03-03 16:58:49 I don’t remember last time i got oil change and be sticker is gone wtf
2997 2018-03-03 16:58:37 I'm not getting involved with this w/b conversation lol! It's taken too much of my time up over the past few months. Anyways I'm using oil next week! Yeah! 
2998 2018-03-03 16:58:34 #Adulting today by getting my oil changed, so hopefully no one else expects anything from me. I’m done for the day  #WhoAmIKidding #MomLife
2999 2018-03-03 16:58:27 If you've ever wanted to know why Kentucky's legislature is so nightmarishly corrupt re: coal & oil? You should check the financial disclosures of Republicans AND Democrats. There *might* be a total of 5 folks not raking in $$$ from those industries.
3000 2018-03-03 16:58:25 Free market? Georgia GOP should have never been considering that crony tax cut anyway.
3001 2018-03-03 16:58:25 peppermint oil is my only friend

3004 2018-03-03 16:58:12 As long as they don’t have full semi-automatic weapons with high capacity rapid fire magazines I guess it’s ok.
3005 2018-03-03 16:58:11 As an example. They start buying from Mexico instead. 

We charge Canada and we see them raise the price of oil imported to the US. Tariffs effect all sectors of trade, not just one.
3006 2018-03-03 16:58:07 The guns are the rattle, because the snake is oil.  Where is Zinke, Pruitt, Tillerson?  They left their beast here according to the weather, and the children are in danger for we have reached a run away situation.  The election was all about oil.
3007 2018-03-03 16:57:54 FATAL ACCIDENT | Oil Well Rd & SR-29 | A fatal crash involving a motorcycle has blocked SR-29 in both directions at Oil Well Rd. Expect delays. FHP is investigating.

3016 2018-03-03 16:56:48 Someone needs to harness kitten energy and solve the oil crisis.
3017 2018-03-03 16:56:47 I legit aint smoking to get high at the moment... I'm smoking to help my hip and I bought cbd oil so i can take it on the go.
3018 2018-03-03 16:56:35 This Seattle weather has me leaving the Apple cider vinegar in my hair and rubbing coconut oil on my beard and skin. Ugh the flakes
3019 2018-03-03 16:56:08 @OhioHouseDems I emailed every member of the Ohio legislators, the Governor and Lt Gov. and no one responded. Government agencies are abusing power and ruling with fear or acting like little dictatorships. Hear of ODNR oil and Gas Division needs replaced! Or I will be suing them!

3022 2018-03-03 16:55:48 Grill chicken. Remove. keep warm. Keep fond in skillet. Add olive oil, onions, garlic, bell peppers salt and pepper to taste. Cook five or so minutes. Add cup of white wine. Work fond into mix. When white wine cooks off, add sliced chicken, sprinkle in parmesan and pepper flake.
3023 2018-03-03 16:55:45 Is there anything that this admin holds sacred? Our national monuments can never be replaced. Defile them w/oil drilling? NO!!!
3024 2018-03-03 16:55:32 Haan wahi na, oil nahi hota use or kam hota
3025 2018-03-03 16:55:13 Yes shea moisture is always good ,too much oil will clog ya pores and cause acne so make sure it's not oily
3026 2018-03-03 16:55:13 "Top cooked green beans with slivered almonds, olive oil &amp; fresh ground pepper for a deliciously healthy side dish.."
3027 2018-03-03 16:55:09 The demand-side effect is probably deflationary but ambiguous. The supply-side effect is unambiguously inflationary. (I don't buy the "one time price shock" argument. Each of the 70s oil shocks had a persistent effect on inflation.)
3028 2018-03-03 16:55:08 Getting home heating oil from the pump at the local petrol station and smelling kerosene in the car gets the heart rate up a bit

3030 2018-03-03 16:54:58 I used rosehip oil last night for the first time in so long and this whole week my skin was being rude and it cleared up a lil bit im so 
3031 2018-03-03 16:54:57 I'm not going to be protesting shirtless avis anytime soon... (unless they're feminists. No bueno).

3034 2018-03-03 16:54:29 By “and co.” I also envision the millions and millions of us who cherish clean water and air, and wide open spaces free of the scourge of the oil industry. Let’s battle em! 
3035 2018-03-03 16:54:28 Talk to #calistathepitbull on Instagram! She has a big Instagram presence for animals and recently started giving her dog CBD oil for cancer.  She says it's been a life saver!

3041 2018-03-03 16:54:00 the tree via goat poop provides us with the "aragon oil" found in many of our shampoos and body washes.
3042 2018-03-03 16:53:36 Decided to paint a little over a couple years old oil painting that everyone liked but I was like "meh, not very good, can make it a little better then I'll put it for sale"
Results: I ruined the painting
Spilled solvent over my table
Am highly frustrated
3043 2018-03-03 16:53:29 He’s So Cute! I Hope You Find The Best CBD Oil Money Can Buy Because He Deserves It 
3044 2018-03-03 16:53:24 would be a good message to put onto mfc share, when someone buys snapchat. "Don't open at work and don't open while changing your oil. If you do so it's at your own risk"
3045 2018-03-03 16:53:20 Believe it when I see it.
3046 2018-03-03 16:53:18 The very first area the enemy attacks is the grain, the wine and the oil. He actually woke me up and told me what to do but I didn't do it.
3047 2018-03-03 16:53:04 Of course it is.  That’s why Russian players slide in the draft.
3048 2018-03-03 16:52:58 Face oil. Yay

3050 2018-03-03 16:52:50 Just a friendly reminder to NEVER EVER EVER put coconut oil on a healing tattoo. 

It’s food.
3051 2018-03-03 16:52:49 That’s what important to the president Oil $$ he Cares for nothing else
3052 2018-03-03 16:52:41 Nahhh oil up some cling film, crack an egg into it & twist it shut one end like a choc wrapper, drop in boiling water until it's cooked  easy

3054 2018-03-03 16:52:32 That's Capitalism ask the fathers Cernege and Rockefeller. Steel SBD oil were just pawn for their capitalism ambitions. That's the truth

3056 2018-03-03 16:52:30 That’s it, I’m covering myself in tanning oil & laying on the roof
3057 2018-03-03 16:52:28 This is the wrong time for the oil to run out  it’s freezing in this house & I need to shower 
3058 2018-03-03 16:52:25 It was about oil or oil in Arabia?
3059 2018-03-03 16:52:24 Try 3 eggs. Put in bowl. Don’t mix. Remove one yoke. Take the 2 yokes, break and spread like Tie-dye. Drop in pan with oil. So easy
3060 2018-03-03 16:52:17 1) it only takes an objective look at Nigeria to see that we need to organize it in a more socialist way, like Libya which took its oil wealth and used it to create the highest standard of living in Africa before 2011
3061 2018-03-03 16:52:17 I came to get my oil change and this guy always tries to flirt. Like you can flirt with me by not charging me for the oil change 
3062 2018-03-03 16:52:06 Yeah. Will's not annoying.
3063 2018-03-03 16:52:06 Shocked? Sir, not being rude simply wondering why you are shocked. Donald Trump's history should have told you there was a monentary motive for this move. His is aligned with those that want to drill for oil, mine meneral deposits on our public lands.
3064 2018-03-03 16:52:02 Underemployment and part time crap jobs.   The high paying oil industry jobs are neglected by the libs.  And I know one unemployed “Canadian” who Trudeau made $10.5 million richer...your hero khadr

3077 2018-03-03 16:50:55 Australias children are still breathing. Lets be like Australia. NRA's a terrorist org with goal of disrupting democracy, and enshrining oil /arms industry as our over lords forever. They don't rep American gun owners.  CLAW BACK can be done. It starts with step 1. Lets take it.
3078 2018-03-03 16:50:51 The method is so simple.
Mix together equal amounts of baking soda and cooking oil – for one small jar, a tablespoon of each will be plenty.
Rub the mixture all over the sticky parts of the glass jar.
Leave it on for 30 minutes.
Rub with an abrasive scrubbie (I used steel wool)
3079 2018-03-03 16:50:34 All the rain in Storrs yesterday reminded me of the waterproofing measures birds take to prevent their bodies from getting wet, such as spreading oil from their glands and taking advantage of the tiny hook structures that hold their feathers together #birdclass
3080 2018-03-03 16:50:20 @OhioHouseDems Ind me ONE case of sweet Penn grade oil exposure harming human or animal life which is documented by real facts. I know you can't because it has not! Now ask ODNR to use science, facts and sensible risk/rewards solutions for Sweet Penn grade producing Wells.

3083 2018-03-03 16:49:50 Whatever division we are in next season need a manager who has a 2 year plan because it will be an oil tanker turning scenario.. fans need someone to buy into like Rowett and that will give the manager time
3084 2018-03-03 16:49:50 Yes. I lather baby oil in every single crevice and lay stretched out like a millionaire

3087 2018-03-03 16:49:36 The squeaky wheel may get the oil, but the loudest voice doesn't mean its owner is right. Nor does your ability to bang the gavel constitute righteousness or even that your judgment was proper or just.
3088 2018-03-03 16:49:34 I need an oil change but I am not leaving this house today !!
3089 2018-03-03 16:49:33 You're 50??? 

Blimey! I thought you were about 35!

What's your secret? Whale sperm, the tears of virgins or good old oil of Olay? 
3090 2018-03-03 16:49:29 There is a big oil deal between Exxon Mobil and Russia and they need to get the oil out of Russia because of sanctions that Obama put on them and Trump was helped by Russia so he would lift the sanctions. He isn't because he would expose himself.

3094 2018-03-03 16:49:03 GOP, fighting for the free market every day, unless a company makes them a angry. Only 13 people used discount, the NRA relationship wasn’t exactly profitable. Hurting the state’s largest employer to protect an outside organization doesn’t exactly embody conservative values.
3095 2018-03-03 16:49:03 Yeah when Dulux changed formula with their oil based paints 
3096 2018-03-03 16:49:02 We would love to send you some of our CBD oil!  No additives or preservatives.
3097 2018-03-03 16:48:53 For this chart, i don't know. + its impossible to do ur expectation in this way, cause oil is an independent factor while inflation is a dependent one.

Con: waiting an hour for an inspection and an oil change
3108 2018-03-03 16:47:24 To me its all about the USD - if USD gets crushed then oil prices get bid and rates/inflation expectations move higher.  If USD holds steady or goes higher we get the opposite.  Seen some signs that econ data slowing relative to expectations as well
3109 2018-03-03 16:47:15 I thought Trump was rich. Hm I understand Bush fund raising like this. Why does Trump Need to do this? Does not make any sense. Maybe has to do with the oil deal that fell apart with Russia?
3110 2018-03-03 16:47:14 @infowars is for middle aged white dudes who are insecure about losing testosterone. Go buy more snake oil from the fraud @RealAlexJones. He’s the definition of fake news and bullshit. Fuck you @RealAlexJones

3115 2018-03-03 16:46:31 The author suggests adding oil and vinegar to sandwiches instead. Mayonnaise is oil, vinegar, and egg yolk. It’s not that weird. Using one’s position on a magazine staff to rant about something like this IS weird.

3118 2018-03-03 16:46:25 FedLibs have all the (real) science they need on demise of this species of killer whale here on west coast. Why would Liberals sit, watch the decline & do nothing? Just to be clear...throwing a bit of $ @ the environment portfolio (compared to $3.3billion @ oil) is doing nothing.

3122 2018-03-03 16:45:41 @floraduffy seems to me, especially in wet conditions, that a track used for motor sports will have a worrying amount of surface oil residue? Unless they steam cleaned it first I would think it had to be a factor in all the crashes? Cool UR ok!

SOF！SOF！
3124 2018-03-03 16:45:34 The streets are super dangerous here in LA when It rains! Our lack of rains means are streets have built up oil and car gunk on them and the rain breaks that all up and the streets / freeways are super slippery! We aren’t just over dramatic!  i mean not all of us... hahaha
3125 2018-03-03 16:45:22 That’s a terrible argument. Take the confirmed Stanley cup, at the start of year put down a sum of money on the oil to win.. then you get both!!! Your welcome in advance.
3126 2018-03-03 16:45:19 Aren't a fair few of the CBD products not "true" CBD oil but just hemp oil?
I could be wrong but that's the impression I get. Bit like the coconut oil craze.
3127 2018-03-03 16:45:15 Change my oil
3128 2018-03-03 16:45:02 Sadly that oil fell into the hands of the Saudi Royal family, with the help of the British and Americans, and the region ever since fell into a catastrophe. If only that oil money was used for good rather than promoting Wahabbism across the region.

3131 2018-03-03 16:44:38 Ladies when you’re getting ready to slay, what’s your order of getting ready? Here’s mine:
1. Oil pull/brush teeth
2. Shower
3. Moisturize + apply smell goods
4. Makeup
5. Hair
6. Get dressed
7. Clean up the mess I made
8. Go slay
3132 2018-03-03 16:44:36 Using a pricey crop that is pretty hard on  farm land hardly seems any better than oil.
3133 2018-03-03 16:44:32 and we'll have our own resources including oil and disproportionately less debt than England.  And that's not talking about the increase in trade we'll be able to do by having control over the levers for our economy.
3134 2018-03-03 16:44:25 Oil industry? #RFID is being used to automatically identify assets out in the field, in lay down yards, on rigs, & wherever there's #oil.
3135 2018-03-03 16:44:17 Might chuck some oil over it later :)
3136 2018-03-03 16:44:16 Hey @SethAbramson what happened to the story about Trump receiving that colossal payment from the Russian Oil company right at the start of his Reign of Error?

Nobody cares!
A beautiful paradise in 1980s is a mass graveyard!
Most of middle East countries are down & dusted due to western greed for oil!
Anyways,,,we too are in a nation of 33million Gods?? But where are they?

3140 2018-03-03 16:43:57 This man said 7 hour wait for a oil change  I’m about to do it my damn self
3141 2018-03-03 16:43:55 Castor oil is seriously my eyebrows best friend. Trying to thicken these babies out before I get them done again.
3142 2018-03-03 16:43:54 Co-tenancy passed our senate and is on way for Guvna to sign. They legislated away our property rights to oil and gas extractors. #wvpol #VoteThemOut
3143 2018-03-03 16:43:54 Oh no. Gotta sell my snake oil with infomercials at 3:00 AM on the Discovery channel now.
3144 2018-03-03 16:43:53 Brown sugar, coconut oil and light honey.
3145 2018-03-03 16:43:50 Sorry to butt-in ladies, but you can use castor oil!!!! I hardly had eyelashes until I applied the oil for a week.. it’s amazing.

3149 2018-03-03 16:43:15 To #MAGA you have to MOGA (make oil great again;) how can you MOGA if these shale companies intend to drill themselves bankrupt? Maybe this will pay off by means of higher oil prices.  Wait to see his next move before taking off the hat!

3155 2018-03-03 16:43:02 I’ve had Domino’s four days in a row ... I’m a bag of oil and pineapples.
3156 2018-03-03 16:42:59 I’ve had to get my tires aligned every time i get an oil change because there’s thousands of pot holes everywhere. You have to swerve all over the road to avoid them.
3157 2018-03-03 16:42:56 @HeenaGambhir Few years ago a committee constituted by the government had reccomended that special norms should be adopted by all Oil Marketing Companies while posting officers/personnel at sensitive locations storing and distributing fuels across the country
3158 2018-03-03 16:42:48 It’s done wonders for my parents dog that used to be a breeder dog. She’s afraid of everything. Can’t poop in the city so they drive her into the countryside everyday. CBD oil eases her moods during thunderstorms and such.

3162 2018-03-03 16:42:30 Thanks for contacting us. While we have no regulations on possessing or transporting marijuana products, including CBD oil, possession is a crime under Federal law. Our officers aren't looking for illegal products, but have to report them to law enforcement when discovered.

3165 2018-03-03 16:42:08 Don't worry. Soon a day will come when either their oil will run out or the world won't need any!
3166 2018-03-03 16:42:01 Milk... that would be like striking oil in these parts :)
3167 2018-03-03 16:41:57 @HeenaGambhir Ma'am, India's largest state owned Fortune 500 oil company still does not have any norms for posting Quality Control personnel at sensitive locations even when the adulteration mafia is a multi billion rupee business in the country

3169 2018-03-03 16:41:48 Hmmm.   Seems that Rep. Carter has taken 19K from oil and gas industries in the past year....and is on the Energy Committee.  I think it’s time to say #ByeBuddy
3170 2018-03-03 16:41:38 Eck repeatedly exaggerated the projections made about oil prices to inflate his 'case' for separation. Oil was 'baked into' the White Paper (Andrew Wilson).
3171 2018-03-03 16:41:27 whoever has $1500 and wants an oil painting of themselves let me know
3172 2018-03-03 16:41:23 Yeah. Year 3 for him with over a full season as a starter. Unable to use his size to finish. Hitch in his jump shot. Plays defense like he's the tin man and needs a little oil for his legs. To quote @LockedOnKnicks he's pretty "meh". Might lead the league in "meh" actually.
3173 2018-03-03 16:41:21 We do not deny there are psychically 2 genders. We understand that there are more than 2 sexual orientations & always have been. Gay relationships were in the Bible.  Nuclear power is a cleaner energy source than coal or oil, but Solar wind & natural gas are cleaner & cheaper.
3174 2018-03-03 16:41:19 Man dem weh a fix di road a barbican come een like dem a dig fi gold or try find more oil
3175 2018-03-03 16:41:17 Why can’t something be done about this now? Are these criminals going to be allowed to rape and pillage with impunity sell our public lands to big oil and gas interests kill green energy jobs kill our stock market gains abuse good people because of their race and genders?
3176 2018-03-03 16:41:14 It’s simple Ontario exports steel.  The west exports oil.  Elections are won in Ontario!  Trudeau could care less about prosperity in the west.
3177 2018-03-03 16:41:09 If you can find some sesame oil, rice vinegar, which cheese sauce of flavor," Orkin recommends soft-boiled eggs, the most
3178 2018-03-03 16:41:09 @Rixpetroleum do you have any 25 litre drums of heating oil available at your Attleborough depot? Kinda desperate 
3179 2018-03-03 16:41:00 Or Texas. In oil patches we let oil field trucks tear ours up. Cheaper than fixing them. Kid you not.

3181 2018-03-03 16:40:51 Chinese food from the mall will be oil rn
3182 2018-03-03 16:40:43 Health Tips: find out the oxidation index of the oil you cook with, and choose the lowest number combined with the highest smoke point.
3183 2018-03-03 16:40:43 I figured that it had to be castor oil 
3184 2018-03-03 16:40:38 I cut up the pills and put the biotin in some hair oil products instead of swallowing the pill
3185 2018-03-03 16:40:36 Meanwhile, Canada digs up oil sands in Alberta contributing 66 million tons of CO2/ yr. that's > 130 billion lbs CO2 / yr. nice deflection of the truth Trudeau
3186 2018-03-03 16:40:31 I'm trying it for my old Marley man.. he has seizures and cbd oil has helped a lot of pet
3187 2018-03-03 16:40:27 Definitely works... Have CBD distilleries that sell dogs treats infused with CBD oil
3188 2018-03-03 16:40:15 Well, I was going to get up early and do my emissions test and get an oil change, but I'm still in bed, soooo.... #nevermind
3189 2018-03-03 16:40:14 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
3190 2018-03-03 16:40:10 I found that roasting cauliflower sprinkled with olive oil, and whatever spices you like brings out a lovely sweetness in them. Last night we made a saag from frozen spinach & broccoli. Going a bit Indian with spicing often works for me
3191 2018-03-03 16:40:10 10 พ.ค. 500ล้านนะคะ #KHUNVITATION
3192 2018-03-03 16:40:10 No one thought oil would go the way it did. It’s not only NL gov that got caught. As for MF, my two cents is that every major project goes over budget, but I’m not convinced the Libs doing any better. Down the road, it’ll be better for us, not sure what it takes to get there now.
3193 2018-03-03 16:40:02 That is an issue, the only saving grace there is the recycle ratio of batteries is very high, and there still are environmental impacts of oil extraction and oil is consumed. But with decent but not crippling regulation, that can be managed. It’s not simple as you point out.
3194 2018-03-03 16:39:56 Went to get an oil change, and I come out with new air filter, alignment and a new windshield.

3204 2018-03-03 16:38:51 1 last thing. I was a Republican on till I realized they aren't representing the people! Democrats listen to voters. Republicans listen to Donor's only like Koch's. Our future that we want for you is not oil! But they will do anything to keep us burning oil! Fox news propaganda!

3206 2018-03-03 16:38:38 I hated castor oil with a passion
3207 2018-03-03 16:38:34 Most of them use ethically sustainable palm oil. Its difficult to find products free of it these days 
3208 2018-03-03 16:38:33 they are proper good but so over priced! so much cheaper to make your own by baking it in olive oil for 15 mins, so tasty and healthy 
3209 2018-03-03 16:38:23 You don't get it. Oil is currently bringing in virtually no income. The oil companies are having a tax holiday - because that was what Swinney begged Osborne to do.
3210 2018-03-03 16:38:23 The West Virginia Senate has passed oil/gas co-tenancy on what appears to be (I haven't double-checked it against a list) a party line vote. This isn't directly related to the teacher strike, but I think it illustrates why we're doing what we are.
3211 2018-03-03 16:38:22 Do u need 2 collect overdue billing, but debtors are in Colombia? And from oil&gas sectors? Give me a ring! Things are improving down here.
3212 2018-03-03 16:38:19 Japan wasn't back by anyone and acted alone. Europe acts in unison when it comes to carving up Africa and other parts of the world. False about resources w/ the exception of oil (& diamonds but we don't do diamonds). Nigeria should return more to agriculture (which is a resource)

3221 2018-03-03 16:37:08 I think the point is the NRA is the biggest lobbying group against gun control. Planned Parenthood has its lobbying deal too, but then we could point out Big Steel, Big Oil etc. the problem is who is actually serving the people more than their wallets?

3227 2018-03-03 16:36:25 The Venezuelan government shouldn't be affected this much by the oil industry. If they had left it to the private sector then they wouldn't have garnered so much debt which led to the hyper inflation

3240 2018-03-03 16:34:52 @OhioHouseDems It is Okay to be pro environment but we can't support things that are not based in science! This oil is not TAR based and is used in Makeup Base, Petroleum Jelly, Candle wax and is harmless to everything but grass short term  Save the small Oil and Gas Industry

3243 2018-03-03 16:34:43 And if they’d (for example) laid of a bunch of the civil service, people would still hate them. Not much of a win win for them so close to an election. And did anyone inform you of the tanked out oil prices? That caused this big mess that NOONE  could have predicted.
3244 2018-03-03 16:34:42 จะพยายามมมมมม
3245 2018-03-03 16:34:42 Make sure with the CBD oil or tincture you purchase, they use the whole plant or else it's not as beneficial.

3250 2018-03-03 16:34:09 Great for skin, lips, hair & cooking. Avocado oil for the win 
3251 2018-03-03 16:33:52 Lol! Bruh, Na win either half I carry PSG. What I'm seeing isn't impressive. Still early though.
3252 2018-03-03 16:33:44 From an expat; it's not always better living away. Affordable childcare is a big issue all over Canada. Not everyone who leaves end up with big oil jobs either. There may be lower taxes but fees related to certain services are higher. At least home most people have family help

3260 2018-03-03 16:32:54 My friend is giving her Rotti cannabis oil for a malignant tumour. The tumour had shrunk in size considerably, he has increased energy and appetite, and is no longer displaying pain behaviour. He was given one to two months to live two years ago 
3261 2018-03-03 16:32:45 My hope is VP will go down as helping Trump sell snake oil to our people. 

3262 2018-03-03 16:32:45 She just found your website ... Cheese chocolates and truffle oil...
3263 2018-03-03 16:32:45 Yes! My 12 year old lab has horrible arthritis and I tried everything. I even made him a tumeric paste but he didn’t like it. So now he has cbd oil treats that are pumpkin flavored. It seems to be helping so far! Do it
3264 2018-03-03 16:32:45 Yeah? That ermine-gland oil in that.
3265 2018-03-03 16:32:40 Too bad y'all stopped doing your job this year. Downsizing national monuments due to oil and gas reserves really wasn't something you did for 168 years eh? Can @SecretaryZinke resign yet? Tired of paying for his lobbying trips out west to meet with energy companies.

3270 2018-03-03 16:32:31 Thanks Palmer, always good reads. The information on Koch father building oil refineries for Stalin was new. Help connect Russia and the Koch bros. Murdoch, what’s his game? Thankfully Britain saw through his grab for Sky 5 TV and his bid was rejected as, ‘too much influence’.
3271 2018-03-03 16:32:27 Won't see this in U.S.  Trump and Conservatives to cut funding for clean energy give more to big oil.

3278 2018-03-03 16:32:00 I used to work with fiberglass impregnated plastic. We mixed it by hand. Take a shower as cold as you can stand. The cold will close your pores and cause the glass to break off at the skin surface when scrubbed. Then finish with hot water. Baby oil before drying off.

3280 2018-03-03 16:31:38 @PhilippaBBC Few years ago a committee constituted by the government had reccomended that special norms should be adopted by all Oil Marketing Companies while posting officers/personnel at sensitive locations storing and distributing fuels across the country

Which part of nature do you wish to destroy to cover yourself?
3283 2018-03-03 16:30:54 Everyone be hyping up Coconut oil & Argan oil but have you been using Avocado oil lately ? If not, you should definitely add it to your list !

3286 2018-03-03 16:30:27 We started giving ours CBD oil for knee problems. He is like a whole new dog! We can actually touch him to do physio with him. Life saver!
3287 2018-03-03 16:30:23 Funny you mention Earthquakes- with all the past/present and future unnatural extraction of crude oil from sand, big ones are on the way - pretty soon.
3288 2018-03-03 16:30:19 @PhilippaBBC Ma'am, India's largest state owned Fortune 500 oil company still does not have any norms for posting Quality Control personnel at sensitive locations even when the adulteration mafia is a multi billion rupee business in the country

Works out better anyway. And it's rare people actually use less oil/fat in recipes when using non-stick anyways..

3325 2018-03-03 16:27:04 That’s why I did it. Mine has a hint of orange oil in it I think, but it doesn’t really smell like anything. Honesty it’s basically baking soda lol
3326 2018-03-03 16:27:01 I doubt it would be difficult.

Tell them it's one of those holistic remedies, like oil pulling.
3327 2018-03-03 16:26:59 I’m befuddled by this response. MEX public sector spending rose by 12% of GDP in 1970-76, with only a small revenue offset despite oil; it was financed by inflation & debt; private investment share declined & public investment share nearly doubled. clearly unsustainable
3328 2018-03-03 16:26:57 Hmm... I need to do an oil change on Emelia. Always a pain since apartment complexes don't let you work on your car. Wish there were shops that rented out stalls.

3335 2018-03-03 16:26:15 If a pro market President win there will be an oil opening and $$$$ will keep flowing. There will be money for me you all the venezuelans and even still some money to be robbed. Look at Mauricio Macri’ Argentine..... from default to issuing billions of debt in ONE night...

Renewable energy is a must.  Snake oil is in aisle 3, btw.
3351 2018-03-02 23:58:47 Yes, but oil is a big source of income for Putin. When the price dropped it HAD to have a big impact on military funding.  Check crude price history around summer of ‘15, that’s when he invaded the Ukraine.

3388 2018-03-02 23:55:37 Heating oil prices are kept artificially high by the Big Oil companies with the blessing of the government, both Republican and Democratic. Greed is prevalent though out the world.

3400 2018-03-02 23:53:58 Rail companies, like all public companies, are obliged to maximize shareholder value. They may also be locked into contracts that require them to move oil.

3403 2018-03-02 23:53:48 Indeed! Bit strange no? Not a whisper about oil in any of these negotiations. Fish, crops, trade, bodies (unwanted immigrants), law all on the table. Oil, nothing. Does it just get wrapped up into our GDP and they take their slice? Or is it someone's sweetener?

3405 2018-03-02 23:53:26 Need to oil Mother soon. Get all the hard-to-reach places.
3406 2018-03-02 23:53:19 Different story though if any oil or gas discovered by the exploration was used. And why would anyone explore for oil or gas if they didn't intend to use it?
3407 2018-03-02 23:53:17 First the olive oil, then the sun dried tomatoes. If they dare touch the gin, IT’LL BE THE END OF CIVILISATION AS WE KNOW IT!!!
3408 2018-03-02 23:52:56 So anyway I started my cut on Monday and have been eating super clean. Had some lebanese food today which had some fried aubergines and my belly is really rebuking the oil. Like I've been feeling a bit sick since I ate it

3412 2018-03-02 23:52:28 What is wrong with Nigeria? Petrol and diesel cars are being phased out and every country is investing their money outside oil and you are starting exploration of oil . What is the future of oil in the world economy? Invest the money in sustainable energy and agriculture please.
3413 2018-03-02 23:52:18 Bruhhhh. That’s wild. Maybe all the oil they use

3417 2018-03-02 23:51:20 Joe is right, CKE good bet on West Canadian gas. Today oil is the name of the game. Frustrating as fck this PPR, but I play long-term here!!
3418 2018-03-02 23:51:11 @beardmeatsfood In your videos, you are normally very honest with the viewer, e.g. showing empty containers, to prevent certain criticism. So, I’m surprised that you included £30 for a fryer and £3.50 for oil that were used in a very small part of the £200 of food 200K special.
3419 2018-03-02 23:51:07 Why is anyone surprised that a decision made by one of the secretaries of destruction appointed by President Trump was made to help oil and gas people make money.

3421 2018-03-02 23:50:37 oh my god!!! Important!!  North Korea is now smuggling illicit trade items ON RUSSIAN SHIPS. Ships are turning off locator beacon. Russia transported oil to NKorea against UN sanction. IMPEACH TRAITOR TRUMP!  HE'S DOING NOTHING!  If I saw this on the news, Trump knows, too!

3426 2018-03-02 23:49:27 I agree. It's turning into a joke that in the 21st century, we're still debating this issue.  Other than Christian science; The sect who completely relies on oil and prayer. The majority of Christians use science in their everyday lives than they do their own religion.

3453 2018-03-02 23:44:36 How come then conservatives are responsible for 75% of the debt with Harper adding $183 billion? And $50 billion deficit is not closely balanced. You don't have a job because of OPEC crashing the price of oil just like the 1980s.

3472 2018-03-02 23:43:01 The international community's sanctions hurt every sector of Venezuela's export-economy, except for the oil, making Venezuela nearly completely reliant on just their oil, which could be manipulated by OPEC nations, which ultimately, caused the crisis.

3474 2018-03-02 23:42:46 Nationalist ideas are not unique to Trump and the U.S, the Middle East is enforcing similar tariffs on goods and planned removal of all expats for nationals.

3477 2018-03-02 23:41:57 The USA imports more oil from Canada than any other country in the world.  Can’t make steel without oil...just sayin
3478 2018-03-02 23:41:49 EnergyEast was too expensive to get oil to the Golf coast! And was canceled when Keystone was approved.
3479 2018-03-02 23:41:49 It takes tons of private & govt effort/money to build new energy industry & without revenue from oil/gas exports to fund it, Canada loses

3502 2018-03-02 23:38:38 I agree totally. I disagtee on screwing tax payers. Here is why
3 strategic resources Steel, Alum, Oil. We have been held hostage over oil. Lets not let a agressive militarized China do it over steel. We currently, with Canada have the Alum.

3518 2018-03-02 23:35:05 China produces half of the worlds steel.  They get sneeky by sending excess product to other countries then sale it to the U.S.   Think of Saudi Arabia opening/ closing the oil spicket to control market price.

3531 2018-03-02 23:33:08 That is hate mongering. Liberals out priced out products forcing us to go overseas, it’s all on you people. Over-regulating industries, global warming taxation, union labor scams, regulating oil drilling and then using the media to slam corporations that produce goods.
3532 2018-03-02 23:33:00 Being a girl is so great, the guy walks in at the oil change place and started asking me about buying stuff for my car and I just went "I'm sorry I don't know anything about cars, can you write it down so I can ask my boyfriend?" And he left me alone. #yesido #notgonnabuyit
3533 2018-03-02 23:32:38 In the part of processed meats, I believe that it’s the nitrates added to the meat that cause the problems. Also, even super healthy raw extra virgin olive oil is still processed to become oil in the first place?
3534 2018-03-02 23:32:34 More snake oil spin from the Conman in Chief
3535 2018-03-02 23:32:15 Good luck today.
3536 2018-03-02 23:32:09 Just don't want to know what will happen when oil will crash, dollar will surge as EURUSD will be blown out, same time this record bonds short will be blown out -> I'm scared here...

3543 2018-03-02 23:30:52 He isn't wasting any energy on anything that is good for the west, not only are trains carrying the oil instead of pipeline the grain for food is sitting in bins waiting for those trains to come back so not only cold but hungry soon
3544 2018-03-02 23:30:40 The BLM reports up through to Trump. The removal of our #wildhorses is part of His plan to make way for oil drilling & fracking!
3545 2018-03-02 23:30:37 - smile and did as promised, easily setting the oven to the right temperature with the ease of a routine action. Next she found out her preferred baking tray and poured in a small amount of sunflower oil to grease it up.

3546 2018-03-02 23:30:22 The way we see it is just the opposite. The Dems and Libs, yep you, promote division on DACA. It's part of your political elites Snake Oil Salesmenship. It's not working for the majority of Americans. We'll show you again come November.

3550 2018-03-02 23:29:50 Sweet.  I haven't had oil in a while.
3551 2018-03-02 23:29:41 Money injected into a country's politicians results in divides amongst its' people.This divide is misplaced. Rather it's between the people and the officials allowing this influence.

All sides vulnerable to NRA, Pharma, Oil, Gas, PP, NRA, Cable, Healthcare.  No end in sight...
3552 2018-03-02 23:29:28 Did you really need 25,000 pages to tell you it was all about oil. I think we knew that already. If Trump can squeeze a $ out of anything, it’s worth destroying for that extra $.  Very short sighted. Nice way of saying, really stupid.
3553 2018-03-02 23:29:28 This started as ‘general’ bants v an erroneous statement comparing goalies. Your a super fan of a sh*t club I get that. But your denial is polluting the twitter sphere. Like trying to explain global warming to trump, he just yells coal money & oil. Your familiar with the last two

3555 2018-03-02 23:29:09 So today I set myself and an oil soaked unit on fire, then I spent 3 hours working on the wrong building's A/C... It's been a hell of a day.

3567 2018-03-02 23:27:32 It’s not for no reason. It’s for oil and to instill fear.

3578 2018-03-02 23:25:43 was it Argan oil?
3579 2018-03-02 23:25:33 My single chain always gets tangled when I put it in my purse when at the gym..I always put a drop of olive oil or essential oil on the knot
3580 2018-03-02 23:25:31 Currently locked in my bedroom sniffing essential oil while my son bathed his dog. 

Not sure either will come out of there alive.

3585 2018-03-02 23:23:52 @cvpayne Libertarianism looks better on paper than in practice... steel is critcal to National Security as is oil so there's a pragmatic component to Trump's plan and... added bonus of more jobs so America wins!

3587 2018-03-02 23:23:43 Going to get my oil changed has got to be one of my least favorite things to do

3589 2018-03-02 23:23:14 Not after gas, car payment, insurance, and maintenance such as more frequent oil changes, brakes, and tires.
3590 2018-03-02 23:23:02 Ehehen... Are you saving or investing in an oil block?
3591 2018-03-02 23:22:51 Ahhh got off my ass and did me oil change
3592 2018-03-02 23:22:34 Inhale steam from a few drops oil of oregano in hot water. Oil of oregano is a natural antibacterial and antifungal. It’ll clean that right out.
3593 2018-03-02 23:22:16 American people who think Trump is mak big American great again is delusional. He and his family are the modern day version of snake oil salesman. They are giving up these measely pay to get billions into their failing corporations. Kushner just got 500 million. Not bad I say!
3594 2018-03-02 23:22:16 そう考えると興奮……しねぇわ！！
3595 2018-03-02 23:22:09 Maybe olive oil is a better healthier choice for frying?

3606 2018-03-02 23:20:58 The country of Saudi Arabia only has oil. Should they not trade with anyone for anything? Maybe oil for....... cars? Do we loose because the send us oil do we loose because we send them cars?

3609 2018-03-02 23:20:18 GREED, GREED was the factor of opening up public lands. Like the media, they all want to be first to break ground or news. Oil is GREED for a product we don't need to be tearing up our environment for. We've just been duped into thinking that way by politicians, again for GREED.
3610 2018-03-02 23:20:14 So I have never felt more like an essential oil expert when I boarded a plane and said “hmm that smells like essential oils, what is that lemongrass?” And this random guy sitting in front of me turns around and goes “wow that’s impressive” b/c he had just used it

3616 2018-03-02 23:19:08 I tried using Miyoko’s cultured vegan butter to try and cut down on palm oil but man I just can’t get into it. It’s not BAD.. but I definitely prefer the taste of the soy-free Earth Balance
3617 2018-03-02 23:19:06 List also doesn’t show what most people don’t know and that CANADA  is biggest exporter of oil to US not Saudi Arabia or any other country. We could send it to China. They really want it.

3622 2018-03-02 23:18:43 Remember we had tha shale boom in North Dakota a few years ago? Well Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Russia ramped up production of oil which pushed the price of gas down. Which was good for you and i at the pump, but not good for companies that obtain oil though fracking...

3628 2018-03-02 23:18:12 I agree. All the oil barons in and around the administration, rolling back enviro regs to ease biz contracts (before public input), the outcrys of protection groups who knew the truth... nevertheless, it's awful to be lied to, whether you know it or not. #TakeBackOurLands

3652 2018-03-02 23:14:12 I feel like deep conditioning will help you bro. You pretty much deep condition in accordance to how much you wash your hair. Almond oil, castor oil, tea tree oil and olive oil are oils you can use on your scalp and ends to help nourish and grow your hair too.
3653 2018-03-02 23:13:53 Tak sesuai. Ada ingredients tak boleh adapt with your skin. Cleansing oil tak boleh cause purging.

3662 2018-03-02 23:12:56 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.
3663 2018-03-02 23:12:51 I do really feel for you ladies  My Mum & Dad are the same, the snow is almost up to the handles of their front door & back garden is as bad bit our boiler decided to stop working this morning so we're using an oil filled radiator, thank god we have it

3671 2018-03-02 23:10:59 Agree - it will make things worse in the long run - try to persevere with good nail treatments and when you moisturise your hands make sure you do you nails too! Use cuticle oil regularly - that will really help x

3685 2018-03-02 23:09:07 @WORXTools eBay item  #391000332947. The saw will not start, the brake handle will not move. I'd like to exchange, ship another via priority shipping @n/c. I need a working saw, ASAP! Never used,  oil in resivor for chain.
3686 2018-03-02 23:08:59 Hope there wasn’t oil in any
3687 2018-03-02 23:08:45 Lost in the debate is why @delta needs or deserves a fuel tax break in this era of lower oil prices - Delta CEO
3688 2018-03-02 23:08:40 Ahh It looks very creamy so I assumed oil . Very healthy :)
3689 2018-03-02 23:08:34 Fam. Extra. Virgin. Olive. Oil. Will change your life! I prefer it over coconut oil, way better at healing/moisturizing skin & hair! Get on it
3690 2018-03-02 23:08:24 Because silver, oil, lumber, aren’t resources..
3691 2018-03-02 23:08:11 Coconut Oil and Marijuana are the cures for almost everything!
3692 2018-03-02 23:08:06 All lies to make us pay more carbon isn't a danger to the earth 
Also US funds these lies and the groups who organize the lies 
Funny how airplanes don't count but just Alberta oil does or manufactured cars
3693 2018-03-02 23:08:05 Scotland has a long history of banking, if currency is to be plastic, then we have all the oil we need, if it's sovereigns you like, we have gold reserves too plus the choice of using Sterling or the Euro should we choose. Are you still worried?
3694 2018-03-02 23:08:04 @ShawnMendes tip: do not put too much oil in your muffin batter, it turns out bad. I have previous experiences cough cough
3695 2018-03-02 23:08:00 Someone better call the prayer warriors with the oil!!

3703 2018-03-02 23:06:57 Oh, it was for the kids...  Now I understand.  They're gonna love taking their grandchildren to see all the oil rigs when they're older.   But at least we scored a few bucks
3704 2018-03-02 23:06:43 @CoreyGraham going to the Oil kings game tonight with @IanC56 can we get one of those fancy roster sheets you have? #scouting
3705 2018-03-02 23:06:36 My hair has become so unhealthy, falls out in masses and I've lost my miracle oil I paid £30 for and never used.
3706 2018-03-02 23:06:13 at what point are you allowed to have an oil painting of yourself? asking for a friend
3707 2018-03-02 23:06:10 LOL gotta try that, wonder if olive oil cools faster than water
3708 2018-03-02 23:06:07 Thank you. 
Palm oil processing is taking place here ma'am.
3709 2018-03-02 23:05:50 Well,  at least Trump is not an oil man. He is doing this to benefit the country he loves!
3710 2018-03-02 23:05:47 It’s already time for another oil change shat! 
3711 2018-03-02 23:05:41 Wait... Hellmans makes an avocado oil mayonnaise now?
3712 2018-03-02 23:05:31 Cans are for motor oil
3713 2018-03-02 23:05:02 Not even a boat load

Oil being an 11T a year industry and all other commodities not making up to half combined there is a long way to go in any feasable alternative 
The industry of renewables is a created feel good industry for the do gooders with no end
3714 2018-03-02 23:04:57 Oh my, demand freebies!! Free oil change or something.
3715 2018-03-02 23:04:52 Hey isn't Condi responsible for getting us Russian-oil-loving Rex Tillerson as SecState? So why is she so impatient....
3716 2018-03-02 23:04:43 the problem (a big one) is that you must buy petro with dollar currency but once sold it (if you can), you will get Bolívares currency. So, is not true that the Petro is backed with oil reserves..(Sorry for my english)
3717 2018-03-02 23:04:32 Problem with Reagan was he didn't believe what he was saying was lies. But trickle down economics was snake oil.
3718 2018-03-02 23:04:22 Lou Dibella is an embarrassment 2 boxing snake oil salesman.PBC is a bum fight league that I won't support and neither should anyone else.Golden Boy Boxing is a premium promotion and Top Rank is  up there to.PBC is gross and not cool

3723 2018-03-02 23:03:58 Yes we could but right now& last 100 yrs we are addicted to oil
3724 2018-03-02 23:03:38 WHY IS EVERYONE COMING IN FOR AN OIL CHANGE TODAY!? It’s cold as fuck, it’s raining, don’t you guys know oil and water doesn’t mix? 
3725 2018-03-02 23:03:25 He grabbed his hand and lead it to where the oil was leaking. "R-right there!" he says, his voice breaking slightly.

3731 2018-03-02 23:02:34 I kinda thought if you didn’t have land you weren’t a country, if you don’t have steel you don’t have an offshore oil platform but I’m pretty sure you can still have a country
3732 2018-03-02 23:02:30 All I've done is replace brakes and rotors. Change oil. Replace bulbs. Fix the seat. Fix the heat and ac and wipers oh and the lift arms for the tail gate. So a total of 1500$ for a driving jeep with heated seats haha
3733 2018-03-02 23:02:30 No, he looks at this ssue like all issues, as the con artist he is. Sad that a ‘news’ organization would promote his snake oil.
3734 2018-03-02 23:02:22 last coffee then bed. Nightmares abound. For some, nightmares are like the one I had where I was stuck on a haunted oil rig with zombies, snakes and teeth coming out of the walls. 95% of mine are exes telling me how fucking shit a person I am

3741 2018-03-02 23:01:45 I didn’t say it would. I’m just glad we have someone calling out the stupidity of importing a product that we have a supply of. Are you a fan of our steel workers unemployed while China and Canada rake in billions? And having to transport it with millions of gallons of oil?

3787 2018-03-02 22:55:11 I just can’t believe the oil didn’t heal your extroversion ear

3795 2018-03-02 22:53:16 Canada, up the tariffs on the 35% of oil we send to the U.S..!! big tariffs, huge ones lol
3796 2018-03-02 22:53:03 All appliances work off gas, too costly to change. Every two years you just need to gamble on tieing in to a fixed contract or go to a month by month supplier. No transparency on pricing oil or gas I would imagine?
3797 2018-03-02 22:53:02 I hate watching cable TV because all I see are commercials telling lies talkin bout corn oil is good for you stop lying to me I know Monsanto wants to kill us!!!
3798 2018-03-02 22:52:43 why is sigeumchi-namul so good. why does sesame oil make everything taste good
3799 2018-03-02 22:52:38 I love Madura. I’ve been using coconut oil and baking them. I’ll likely have grilled chicken with vegetables and a balsamic vinaigrette as well.
3800 2018-03-02 22:52:22 Domestic goddess  
Did you use rapeseed oil ?
3801 2018-03-02 22:52:20 Do you know the U.S. produces. More oil than the Middle East?  It’s just that our consumption is more than we produce.  We were on the right track and numbnuts  did away with mass transit bills, solar , wind legislation.
3802 2018-03-02 22:52:11 Yeah, I had not one mechanic look at this car thing....I HAD 2 OR THREE!!

Nope, it's a car problem related to the oil somehow!? Has nothing to do with icy conditions. Nope, that was LAST WEEK for me!! I barely drive in ice/snow storms unless I need to.

3806 2018-03-02 22:51:45 Oil can be siphoned off, but did you not see the salt? All that salt AND two stock cubes 
3807 2018-03-02 22:51:39 My art teacher wants me to finish a oil painting in 2 days oil paintings usually take like 2 weeks, this is what I'll be doing for the next 48 hours
3808 2018-03-02 22:51:22 On the fourth attempt today the doctor was able to get a needle into my veins without going through them, only to exclaim “oh there’s blood now how strange” and I retorted (under sedation) “were you expecting oil or jelly instead?” And then promptly bled everywhere

3811 2018-03-02 22:51:06 How to pee when stuck in traffic:
Open hood. Pretend to check oil - but pee. Check oil, too, if indicated. Walk away & look cool.
3812 2018-03-02 22:51:05 Trump had no qualms about stealing oil from other countries so it shouldn't be a surprise his administration would steal public land for oil.
3813 2018-03-02 22:50:59 Maybe because "light" = fake. Real mayo has only these ingredients: egg yolks, lemon juice, mustard (an emulsifier), salt and a good oil (& maybe ground white pepper).

3818 2018-03-02 22:50:08 Russia has been teasing/working against the US in an aim to take over Alaska. Could it happen? Why not? Russia is working on oil extracting & exports from N. Arctic, Alaska figures into that. I see the "Cold War" build up also.
3819 2018-03-02 22:50:06 【ad】Few things are as versatile as our oil. "Oilmighty" can use for cooking, gear and even lubricant for your relationship!
3820 2018-03-02 22:50:04 Here’s an idea regarding the steel market: if China’s dumping their stuff here, buy up a strategic reserve. It would give us what we need in war time, at the artificially low price they’re dumping at. It would also drive up demand, and thus market prices. We do it with oil.

3823 2018-03-02 22:49:35 New Nat leader @simonjbridges says on @NewshubNationNZ he wants to lead on enviro. That means ending oil exploration, as we can’t afford to burn half existing reserves if we are to avoid climate catastrophe. Looking forward to new policy!

3826 2018-03-02 22:49:09 Did you tell the mechanic to look at it?  It depends on where you take it.  If I take it to Walmart, tell them to change the oil, that's what they do and that's what I get.  The shop I take it to will do exactly what I tell them to do, but will tell me if I need something else.
3827 2018-03-02 22:49:07 I got this new hair oil and it's changed my life 
3828 2018-03-02 22:48:55 I wonder why the Trump administration is pro oil and anti renewable. Renewable energy is unlimited. Oil is a limited source. Oil can be controlled and rationed, the other cannot. Is it about control?
3829 2018-03-02 22:48:30 Ya know now I think about it, it’s a fucking awesome feeling to get a full Lucas Oil stadium to stand for you
3830 2018-03-02 22:48:23 Rice is on the board of Tillerson's oil company. Of course she wants Dems 2 wrap up. Rice is a Republican shill. Too bad! Keep at it @RepAdamSchiff!

3831 2018-03-02 22:48:19 I’m out of my micellar water, my shea butter, my coconut oil, and out of concealers.... lol yikes. Big yikes
3832 2018-03-02 22:48:13 My skin is sooo dry and cracked, someone pls recommend an oil free moisturiser that will help, I’ll legit pay anything rn 
3833 2018-03-02 22:47:57 Oh i have. I 'locks in' moisture so probably not great for oily skin types. I use coconut oil for hair, body, face and my skin is spotless. May not work for some, definitely not most. It's a great oil.
3834 2018-03-02 22:47:54 Oooh, good choice, @PALMommy2002 ! We're curious, what is your favorite way to use this incredible oil?

3837 2018-03-02 22:47:38 I wanna know what happened to $30 oil changes bc if you think I’m gonna pay $80 YOU ARE WRONG
3838 2018-03-02 22:47:35 It sounded like they were doing too much or that they were gonna pull the same shit that happened the last time i went to get an oil change
3839 2018-03-02 22:47:21 Like oil?
3840 2018-03-02 22:47:16 Pretty sure that vegan cheese is just congealed soybean oil
3841 2018-03-02 22:47:08 Overheard in the lovely cafe I'm working from today: “I also love olive oil and like, um, balsamic.”
3842 2018-03-02 22:46:58 Oil .7  sorryGold 1.5
3843 2018-03-02 22:46:55 OMG LOVE IT!! I will try some nail oil. need to work on growing mine too.
3844 2018-03-02 22:46:16 Truffle oil is just foot sweat that costs a lot of money.
3845 2018-03-02 22:46:03 I would literally rather have a maladroit bottle of oil as president than @realDonaldTrump
3846 2018-03-02 22:46:02 OOOOH I'VE GOT AN IDEA. Let's lobby to have peanut oil used for gun lubrication. Then they'll definitely be too dangerous to bring to schools.
3847 2018-03-02 22:46:00 Brilliant isnt it. Snake Oil for me. Pure class. Can't wait to see them live again.
3848 2018-03-02 22:45:57 I use coconut oil bye far the best ive found.

3852 2018-03-02 22:45:18 For example - should we invade sovereign nations so that our mates can steal their oil and install McDonalds in the high street?
3853 2018-03-02 22:44:55 Lavender and/or peppermint oil help to relieve pressure if your pain is sinus related. (Also, hot toddies, but that may be for after working hours!)
3854 2018-03-02 22:44:51 Mayo is really just oil and egg. 

Have never tried it but frying things in oil tastes good and eggs make french toast so not crazy
3855 2018-03-02 22:44:44 Submechanophobia. Absolutely terrified of being close to gigantic man-made things submerged in water.

Think floating in the sea as a monstrous oil tanker passes by you, or being underwater as a submarine passes below you. There’s a subreddit dedicated to it. Horrific.

3870 2018-03-02 22:42:21 Last year there was news on Trump & Tillerson (no way do I believe they didn't know each other b4 being in office) having their sights on competing w/Russia in oil & gas via exporting from Gulf of Mexico to Europe & S. continents. They both r involved in the N. Arctic deal. Con't
3871 2018-03-02 22:42:20 Took a while to find this again!! Do you store your fud in glass? Once bought some olive oil in a plastic bottle; the bottle shrank & twisted Never again! Alcohol is natural isn't it? So is licorice, wine, sherry, chocolate...... make your own marshmallows & you're sorted
3872 2018-03-02 22:42:19 Coconut oil is high in lauric acid and a naturally antiviral, antibacterial & antifungal food. Add 1-2 Tbsp. to your daily Green Smoothie!
3873 2018-03-02 22:42:07 My day instantly gets better when I apply my beard oil. It is named "Dragon's Blood". It smells phenomenal.
3874 2018-03-02 22:42:02 I'm seeing block buying in the last 2 days in oil and energy names, and I think DXY is being smashed to prop up stocks... be careful out there, extreme COT positions can always get more extreme, no one expected oil to get from 42 to 66 in six months as they kept referencing COT

3876 2018-03-02 22:41:56 It's divine especially when you add curry and thyme to oil first.

3878 2018-03-02 22:41:46 Olbas oil and eyes do not mix kids. The pain i just experienced is not even comparable to a kick in the bollocks
3879 2018-03-02 22:41:38 " NOT the #Oil #salesman who making promises..."

But I have to file some gurus of positivity into that category,  when they appear to take no account of when hope, optimism and positive world views can be the wrong modality, and can go badly wrong.
3880 2018-03-02 22:41:30 Deep fried in coconut oil and served with cauliflower rice. Job done. #Pioppi
3881 2018-03-02 22:41:28 But since this closed at pit under that resistance, it still doesn't mean it's a reversal does it? Or has it now gotten triggered to now we can expect a rise again before big dark blue really does it's magic?

3883 2018-03-02 22:41:19 I imagine historians are burning the midnight oil to keep up with daily events. Never ever anything even close to this bizarre Presidency. The rapid pace of absurdity and atrocity is mind boggling. They must be exhausted, I am!!!!

3888 2018-03-02 22:40:41 @SenCarmichaelWV I do my job. I do it well. I have taught thousands of students and I love them. This political game you are playing, choosing to place your loyalty with Gas and Oil, instead of our people, is shameful. Your attitude toward us is shameful. #CANTSTOPWONTSTOP
3889 2018-03-02 22:40:40 @bfraser747 If you decide to try CBD oil, be sure to get it from a reputable dealer. It’s a derivative of cannibas without the psychotropic properties. It helps a TON of people and I have a friend w/ stomach cancer and that got him through it.

3898 2018-03-02 22:39:50 Seriously thought this was about motor oil.
3899 2018-03-02 22:39:33 The GOP are wonderful snake oil salesmen. They've managed to convince some Dems ( my Senator included) that dismantling Frank Dodd will help smaller banks and consumer protect Seniors! Dems negotiate and compromise and GOP dismantles deconstructs destroys.
3900 2018-03-02 22:39:31 YES. I don’t need anyone to legitimize the choices I’ve made in my sex life because it’s my shit. Good and bad, it’s mine. If you need @VP to be okay with the stuff you do, you got some problems, hunny.
3901 2018-03-02 22:39:13 Trump is selling Bear Ears for oil money?? Color me the least surprise when I called this last year. Republicans are scum.
3902 2018-03-02 22:39:04 A lot of damage from mining and logging and oil extraction can be done on the meantime.
3903 2018-03-02 22:38:59 Should we go after Saudi Arabia. They started over producing oil to drive down the price and drive oil sands producers out of business.
3904 2018-03-02 22:38:57 May uncle ako na taga gawa at ayos ng aircon sa mga fastfood. Lahat as in lahat sa mga fastfood, sobrang dudumi daw ng kitchen. Daming ipis. Linilinis lang 'ata kung may inspection na nangyayari. Kadiri daw talaga pati yung oil na ginagamit sa pagpiprito ng manok? Madumi din.
3905 2018-03-02 22:38:56 I will NEVER take my car there for an oil change, EVER AGAIN.

3915 2018-03-02 22:37:53 Wish there was somewhere I could eat that I could trust is gluten, sugar, and dairy free and only cooks with olive oil and served hormone free meat and green vegetables but.... guess I’ll cook at home 
3916 2018-03-02 22:37:42 Where was YPG when DAESH was killing civilians? 

They were fighting DAESH, destroying their terrorist state, and rescuing those civilians-across northern Syria.

Where was Turkey? Watching, sorry, watching, aiding and buying much, much oil off
3917 2018-03-02 22:37:41 Opponents will find every excuse to kill rail. If this were freight trains, highways, or an oil pipeline, these residents wouldn’t be saying a thing. All would require eminent domain and would be far more hazardous to the environment. Passenger rail is not Texas enough for some.

3927 2018-03-02 22:36:31 Sadly, I think they are neither idiots, nor logic-proof, but uncaring liars, willing to risk spills/other environmental & human mishaps, for the $ to be made on the oil.
3928 2018-03-02 22:36:26 You were like General McMasters forgetting to tell them that they will be paying higher prices for their cars, higher prices for their gas and oil + higher prices for any product made with aluminum or Steel. Phony tax cuts Mixed with tariffs is a tax on the people. Hoax!

3930 2018-03-02 22:36:04 Other thing that made SH worse was it was a legislative bill rather than executive action. So if you're state didn't "get some tariffs" on first go round, you had an incentive to add random stuff your state made. Like linseed oil. Believe SH started small at first.

3934 2018-03-02 22:35:35 Because in 2016-17 the gap between Scotland spending and income was a whopping £13 Billion. The hole in the finances will of course be filled by UK. But if you left  UK you'd never do it. (Don't say oil revenue would cover it as it would come nowhere near on current oil price)

Rather amusing in a  way. When Scotland allowed windmills 2 go in off shore of his golf course, he raised all kinds of hell. Guess it only matters when the property belongs to him, i.e. none in FL

3962 2018-03-02 22:31:35 Lmao you're such a tool If I run out of electricity I can still use oil. I'm not balling out on a Tesla
3963 2018-03-02 22:31:25 Your team had quite the following in the Texas and Oklahoma oil fields as well. 
3964 2018-03-02 22:30:56 Sounds like most snake oil salesman, uh, I mean guys who preach from a pulpit on religious platforms.
3965 2018-03-02 22:30:54 It is crystal clear we cannot count on #GOP to protect our #publiclands.  They have sold their souls to oil/gas/mining/logging/NRA $$.  Anyone else curious why @SecretaryZinke appointed Wayne LaPierre's wife to National Parks @GoParks board of directors?  Register and VOTE!
3966 2018-03-02 22:30:42 Is there another type of oil I can use for my hair because I'm apparently allergic to coconut

3972 2018-03-02 22:30:08 my anxiety is back man and I ran outta CBD oil
3973 2018-03-02 22:30:03 The term "canola oil" is short for "Canada Oil low acid," a name coined to avoid the less marketable word for the product, "rapeseed oil".
3974 2018-03-02 22:30:03 OIL DIFF: 3.22 -> 3.22
3975 2018-03-02 22:30:02 I used tea tree oil and use to press down on it 
3976 2018-03-02 22:29:38 It's a tool box for radio machine.
And metal things is case of lubricating oil.
3977 2018-03-02 22:28:59 It wasn't the weather. [It's around the 50s right now today.] It was THE CAR ITSELF!! 

I had car problems after getting an oil change today. I am shocked my car didn't choke on me going on the roads. And the mechanic didn't even bother looking at it. 
3978 2018-03-02 22:28:56 Me too. I got them a lot when I worked in oil and gas.
3979 2018-03-02 22:28:38 The best would be creating a new militia, like in #Shingal. After all i dont think #KDP and #PUK are capable to take back control, beside the fact that they will not go to Kirkuk for protecting people but steal the oil.
3980 2018-03-02 22:28:33 Time to change that oil in your hair.
3981 2018-03-02 22:28:31 Still can’t get used to the taste of CBD oil 
3982 2018-03-02 22:28:22 if the olive oil has frozen, presumably in your house, then how are you not dead?
3983 2018-03-02 22:28:19 Oh i meant the original intent/content of my tweet. The oil itself? Totes gay
3984 2018-03-02 22:28:18 Hahahaha, naija, this correlation fit cause world war oh!!!
This Kurt guy head get oil on top sha
3985 2018-03-02 22:28:13 Have you tried CBD oil?
3986 2018-03-02 22:27:55 It wasn’t in 1973 either... it’s agai complicated as it is referring to a pure oil field... Groningen was/ is bay far bigger and is a gas condensate field which in 73 was producing way more barrels... it’s easy to skew oil and gas facts...

3988 2018-03-02 22:27:48 i once dated a girl who was obsessed with coconut oil and never shut the fuck up about it like there were times where i thought she was probably shoving entire jars up her ass
3989 2018-03-02 22:27:47 Rail is being used for oil transportation reducing transportation for grains. Get of your ass and get the pipelines going. At this point you are no better than your father when comes to western Canada. You boast you are all Canadians. Prove it to the West you better than Pierre
3990 2018-03-02 22:27:47 I would advice you to drink one spoon at least of original olive oil.

3996 2018-03-02 22:27:19 Spend an hour with 3 screaming kids at @EdmontonDodge waiting for my oil change to be done only to find out hours later I could have waited until later in the afternoon and we would have seen @RNH_93
3997 2018-03-02 22:27:04 Have you tried tea tree oil? 
3998 2018-03-02 22:27:02 Oh no!  We use to has to heat wid oil in Brooklyn. And Germany.  As long as u is ok Emm. Dat's da important part.

4001 2018-03-02 22:26:02 ; Steaks, macaroni & cheese, & sweet potatoes drizzled with oil & honey - sprinkled with cinnamon is what’s for dinner. I haven’t fixed my husband an actual home-cooked meal since I quit working on Monday’s, & we are never home on the weekends. #ILoveMyHusband 
4002 2018-03-02 22:25:59 Use coconut oil ko vaseline
4003 2018-03-02 22:25:50 Normally don’t disagree with @RT_com  but gas and oil are bought in advanced all over the world! You buy it months in advanced! You’re not going to not receive something that you have already payed for!  surely you people know this?
4004 2018-03-02 22:25:32 I retrieved our spare bottle of olive oil from the garage earlier. A cloudy solid. Weird.
4005 2018-03-02 22:25:20 Grain stuck in the praries because we have to fill railcars with oil. Build the bloody pipeline already! @PnPCBC
4006 2018-03-02 22:25:13 Made peppermint tea & put a teaspoon of coconut oil in it. Splendid. Like drinking a warm hug.
4007 2018-03-02 22:25:04 I use them as a substitute for nut milk in my smoothies: 3 tablespoons, half a banana, water, frozen berries and spinach  sometimes I add MCT oil
4008 2018-03-02 22:24:54 break out the steel wool and some oil!
4009 2018-03-02 22:24:51 Getting my oil change rn and idk why I decided it was a good idea to get a couple extra services done while I’m here when I got places to be smh @ myself
4010 2018-03-02 22:24:33 How many of you have used or thought of using cannabis oil for pain treatment?
4011 2018-03-02 22:24:32 Agree cot is not a good timing tool but clearly shows the potential for violent correction when it corrects. IMO the price action is indicating that correction is coming v shortly & cot suggest itll be swift... like we see in oil atm
4012 2018-03-02 22:24:30 It's not just oil & gas. They don't want hydro, mining, forestry, hunting, fishing - you name it, leftists are against it.
4013 2018-03-02 22:24:01 yeah, coz of the oil
4014 2018-03-02 22:23:59 I don’t have one.... I have a s/l daily close over 13850
4015 2018-03-02 22:23:54 I try and help the environment by scrubbing oil off of ducks in oil spills. Now if I can only get my son to stop pouring oil on his duck.
4016 2018-03-02 22:23:36 Okay! I heard her saying  coconut oil to be used on her face! Hence my tweet! As great as coconut oil may seem, it's actually not good for most ppl!

4019 2018-03-02 22:23:00 Yes.

She was MEASURABLY the worst Natl Security Adviser in U.S. history. 
Then she lied & troops died.
Then she left her post as SoS w/out securing a Status of Forces Agreement for our troops stuck in her Oil War.

Oh, & Exxon named an oil tanker after her.
4020 2018-03-02 22:22:47 Ide love to see where our state gets the money. GOP made it nearly impossible to raise revenue, won't even bring themselves to vote for a teacher pay raise. All thanks to a 1% tax on oil & gas. 
Who could have known the price of oil would fall...
Anyone not in the @GOP really
4021 2018-03-02 22:22:45 Hey #US! I think crude oil $61 $63 per barrel is ok price. What do you think. Give me 100 if agree. If you guys think I should drop oil price give me below 100.
4022 2018-03-02 22:22:45 I remember the good old days of news when there were wars, crashing oil tankers and an item about a dog that could say sausages
4023 2018-03-02 22:22:44 Yo I can’t believe people are out here trying to mix THC Oil and E juice and trying to flip it. I will make you waste your damn time showin up with something as fucked up as that and not give you one cent for that time. Fuck outta here.
4024 2018-03-02 22:22:40 Strome can stay as No. 3 C if RNH or Leon is winger, with Jujhar Khaira a the No. 4 C. Oil needs wingers, lots of 'em

4029 2018-03-02 22:21:45 After being in the car for over an hour, I’ve discovered that I too smell like sesame oil.
4030 2018-03-02 22:21:24 And they will have to pay it back at the end of the year.
It isn’t a tax reform bill... it is a putin drills alaskan oil bill.
4031 2018-03-02 22:21:19 なるほど船ですね！
4032 2018-03-02 22:21:19 Big shocker here: the Trump administration chose to reduce national parkland under the guise of giving parkland to the states, but actually intends to use the land for its oil and natural gas reserves. Who in this country is stunned.
4033 2018-03-02 22:21:18 How did the oil man get me in Charlotte too man smh.
4034 2018-03-02 22:21:17 I need an oil change. Idk where to go to get one as soon as tomorrow morn
4035 2018-03-02 22:21:16 《オリーブ油豆知識》

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
4036 2018-03-02 22:21:00 Wow, I really got myself with the oil from my stir-fry. Good job I'm wearing my slobby shirt so it doesn't matter.
4037 2018-03-02 22:20:50 Thanks Tracey, butter it is! I’m sure last time I bought flora/pure they were just sunflower. It’s creeping into everything, even oatcakes that I know had just sunflower oil in. Don’t get me started on cream crackers. Grrr! How’s the snow over your way

4039 2018-03-02 22:20:44 I was driving behind a Chevy Volt with the license plate “lol oil”
4040 2018-03-02 22:20:41 It’s heartbreaking because dingus hasn’t sold it to offshore oil yet? Or heartbreaking because people are using an otherwise abandoned building and he can’t make a buck on that?
4041 2018-03-02 22:20:37 Sounds like you haven't tried paleo / ketosis diet.  Requires some research, but pretty easy once you are in.  Cut out all sugar, grains, bread, rice pasta, etc.  Then eat as much as you like of all the other good stuff, w majority of calories from olive oil, butter, lard, etc.
4042 2018-03-02 22:20:33 Is it possible that too much of our CPP is tied up in oil and gas and that is why pm wants pipelines to go through.  Another case of good money after bad?
4043 2018-03-02 22:19:58 We kept ours well fed with an onion bag full of raw oats, seeds and oil. Great activity at the feeders today, with the robins unusually coming to grab a bite
4044 2018-03-02 22:19:46 Soak them in some Evapo-rust then oil them up...stuff is magic
4045 2018-03-02 22:19:45 When you say “R” for resources, do you mean energy and material company stocks like Exxon, $eog, or the actual commodity like oil?
Also, what do you mean by media, $DIS, $NFLX?
4046 2018-03-02 22:19:30 like water & oil.........
4047 2018-03-02 22:19:09 I use talcum powder to detangle. Coconut oil stains clothes (I’d rather use chapstick or the wax that you use for the thread if you’re into book binding)
4048 2018-03-02 22:19:07 The “oil money” hasn’t bin pumped into the club since 2013, you lot should be thanking Man City not insulting us

4052 2018-03-02 22:18:48 Also before I got my RN degree,  I used to work in the oil fields driving a semi hauling crude and diesel. I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt I could kill way more people with a semi loaded with a 100000 pounds then a gun.
4053 2018-03-02 22:18:47 so was oil till we address it so we cant fire back up the American steel and aluminum industry
4054 2018-03-02 22:18:39 That's how I feel about all of the money we give to oil companies to explore for more oil. After all of the tax breaks they get, many years Exxon pays no taxes. But yeah, poor people being able to eat, that's the problem.
4055 2018-03-02 22:18:28 Took my car to get the oil changed and heard the guys yell “this is a pretty sick 4Runner” 
And I got all excited 
4056 2018-03-02 22:18:28 the drunk elephant marula oil. meanwhile, the ordinary one is fuckin' $7.

4058 2018-03-02 22:17:56 As I think you know, Alma, I prefer my asparagus with oil and salt. Knowing this, you have prepared the asparagus with butter. Right now I’m just admiring my own gallantry for eating it the way you’ve prepared it.
4059 2018-03-02 22:17:41 Try giving him 1/4 tsp of UNREFINED coconut oil a day - will help him immensely

4063 2018-03-02 22:17:14 Wtf what oil costs $80?
4064 2018-03-02 22:17:00 He has so much intimidated Nigerians like a bully
To even tell us how much we have made so far on oil sales, no way. He feels we are scared not knowing that we are writing down the properties he brought from his cattle village so as make sure he doesn't steal any when going back
4065 2018-03-02 22:16:57 You expected anything different from this snake oil salesman?
4066 2018-03-02 22:16:52 どちらのひとなんですか？
4067 2018-03-02 22:16:41 today i got black waterproof oil based paint on the front and back of my left hand. today i spent maybe twenty minutes trying to scrub said paint off my hand using acetone, that weird gritty orange soap, and warm water
4068 2018-03-02 22:16:39 We know the economy is chugging along in spite of the president and that "strong Leadership" is a joke which is why nothing's gotten done that the old guard Republicans didn't want. 

But keep selling that snake oil Sarah, I'm sure it makes dad proud to be in the family business.
4069 2018-03-02 22:16:33 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
4070 2018-03-02 22:16:31 Last night I was lying in bed, listening to the Doors. I really should oil those hinges ...

4082 2018-03-02 22:14:15 "The declaration of love hovered between them, hanging in the rifling smoke of the oil lamp like an apparition." My favorite sentence from my novel. This love was epic. #amwriting #amediting #wordnerds #bookaddict #histfic
4083 2018-03-02 22:14:12 Yes, it makes so much sense. Exxon named an oil tanker after her! 

There is no reason for her to put her thumb on this particular scale, except either she's done something illegal &/or sanctions are killing her. This is NOT the type of thing Bushes would send her out to do.
4084 2018-03-02 22:14:04 Disappointed in @Ford. 2013 car engine seized; no warning. I kept up with maintenance, regular oil changes, I've only had it two years and less than 50,000 miles. Total of around 87,000. It shouldn't have died. Goodbye savings.

4090 2018-03-02 22:13:18 it's a contentious issue. There is a discontent among wider BC population than just environmental activists. From economic point of view its' in BC's interest to protect its tourism and fishery industries which a major bitumen oil spill would hurt.

4105 2018-03-02 22:10:56 (Lucky for us Trump has not thought far enough ahead, to actually connect the places he opens up to most places actually profitable for extracting minerals or oil.)
4106 2018-03-02 22:10:52 て～ひろさん おめでとうございます
4107 2018-03-02 22:10:51 But I need my oil blotting papers from the Rite Aid around the corner! How else will my skin stay oil free?!
4108 2018-03-02 22:10:48 Note: Extra virgin olive oil has a smoke point of only 320 degrees Fahrenheit, making it unsuitable for deep frying.
4109 2018-03-02 22:10:46 Imagine my delight today when I reached for the olive oil and pulled out whiskey
4110 2018-03-02 22:10:45 Coconut oil is your best friend! I’ve lightened my hair 3 times in the last 6 months (I have a bunch of highlights) and there’s minimal damage (bc of the hairdresser) but also bc i deep condition with coconut oil like once a week 
4111 2018-03-02 22:10:34 If there is oil there, zinke will shrink the NP to allow access to it. He is going destroy our NP system.
4112 2018-03-02 22:10:30 Yes. Pierre Trudeau was the cause of the international oil downturn. According to the gospel of Alberta. I'm sick of this stuff.

4119 2018-03-02 22:09:36 Anything under £30 and I have dry skin but still get acne - acne triggered by my skin overproducing oil after dryness. I need balance!
4120 2018-03-02 22:09:20 A laptop doesn’t produce sources. Nor does it clear them. This fundamental and original sin of technocratic con-men, is both their snake oil and their downfall.
4121 2018-03-02 22:09:18 A delicious & easy ALL vegetable lo mein!  In olive oil, sauté mixed veggies until soft. Add spaghetti squash (roasted and in noodles) with equal parts soy sauce and maple syrup. Garnish with your favorite nut if desired & enjoy!!  #vegan #vegetarian #healthy #recipes
4122 2018-03-02 22:09:16 ...but, my darling French fries, if you want to bathe in truffle oil from time to time, you have my support. I’m happy if you’re happy.
4123 2018-03-02 22:09:11 Chilling waiting on this oil change
4124 2018-03-02 22:09:11 Submitted, phew!!  (and then saw the note about the extension) makes the midnight oil that much sweeter though!  
4125 2018-03-02 22:08:59 Chia oatmeal w/ coconut oil, cinnamon, ground flaxseed for breakfast with Spirulina/Cholerra green juice and a granny smith apple. Probiotic yogurt w/ honey sounds good right about now with the added benefit of alkalizing my stomach at the moment
4126 2018-03-02 22:08:49 Take the next step @SecretaryZinke after cancelling the #ChacoCanyon oil/gas lease --  give the land permanent protection!
4127 2018-03-02 22:08:42 Foos so dumb they try to deep fry chicken wings in extra virgin olive oil trying to be healthy. 
4128 2018-03-02 22:08:39 Baby oil.
4129 2018-03-02 22:08:36 love it but no you need an oil guy lol
4130 2018-03-02 22:08:32 OIL IS TOO COSTLY TO USE
4131 2018-03-02 22:08:31 In the Gospel of Jason, the global oil supply glut and falling prices in the early 1980s was caused by Pierre Trudeau.
4132 2018-03-02 22:08:26 God that's gorgeous! My son just towed Cam Newtons Mayback to a Mercedes dealer for an oil light!
4133 2018-03-02 22:08:16 just bought a vape. need that pressure oil now lol
4134 2018-03-02 22:08:14 ルーラが言ってた

4136 2018-03-02 22:08:03 Trump is trying to drill oil from an animal reserve in alaska and is spending tax 1.4Trillian dollars from are taxes they say there is a safe way to remove the oil BT there have bin mistakes and what if they make a mistake what is wrong with America.
4137 2018-03-02 22:07:56 <living bottle of olive oil
4138 2018-03-02 22:07:23 Over a 2 and a 1/2 hour wait for an oil change... @TireDiscounters never going back.
4139 2018-03-02 22:07:21 Lucas oil, que lindo estadio, #Omaha
4140 2018-03-02 22:07:14 What is a market? What produce does a market offer and sell?And so, what produce does Scotland, and England, take to this market? Scotland has oil, gas power generation, water,natural resources. And then agricultural, manufactured goods, technology. England?
4141 2018-03-02 22:07:00 Dude. Something FUCKING AMAZING just happened to my car. I scraped the bumper on a pole, lil scratch I couldn’t grouchily unsee, paper towel of olive oil made it go the fuck away!!!!!
4142 2018-03-02 22:06:30 Hi Ailsa,
I use butter. Not suitable I know if you are vegan. Some cakes, buns & muffins can be made with oil though. I make an easy yoghurt cake with oil. In this case I use Rapeseed (Tesco vegetable is 100% Rapeseed) or Corn oil, Sunflower or Coconut oil.

4145 2018-03-02 22:05:56 @realDonaldTrump Back to West Palm Beac( for more golfing? The people hired you to work out of the White House & get the work of the people done! Ur destroying this country Ur snake oil salesmen!
4146 2018-03-02 22:05:55 @YoungLivingSG I’ve been sick with a stomach bug for days, taking Imodium and Pepto. Today I finally thought “YL Peppermint Oil”, put a drop under my tongue and another all over my stomach and within a couple of hours I’m feeling a lot better
4147 2018-03-02 22:05:24 Believe me. We love it when Northern Alberta boys are playing for the Oilers! So I agree with you. We love it when Northern Alberta boys are playing for anyone! When HABS play Oil, always mentioned that Gallagher is from Sherwood Park. And Daniel Carr.
4148 2018-03-02 22:05:23 It's a pity it wasnt done years ago. But I am pleased it is being done . UK debt is out of control, and sadly we have nothing to show for our oil and gas revenues for decades other than huge debts.
4149 2018-03-02 22:05:12 I’d rather spill water than oil, dearie. Let’s not distract with re-direction. The infrastructure does need to be re-invested in, absolutely, but trying to pin it on the states to balance #Chump’s, err, @realDonaldTrump ‘s, budget is not going to fool anyone.
4150 2018-03-02 22:05:06 Same.
4151 2018-03-02 22:04:58 “I sit back and watch the world through eye holes in my oil paintings”
4152 2018-03-02 22:04:58 I strongly dislike coming to get an oil change 
4153 2018-03-02 22:04:48 much more. 2 years ago Europe commission decided not arrest gasprom 20 billions because that Gasprom promised to sell oil by Europe rules.
4154 2018-03-02 22:04:47 @gregboso you keep talking about the tax on oil and gas and how 7.5 percent will cripple the industry. Can you please inform me (I am a member of your district) if you have received any money from the oil and gas industry?
4155 2018-03-02 22:04:44 Sweden doesn't have the oil money, and we have 480 days paid parental leave. Don't be so... Indoctrinated.
4156 2018-03-02 22:04:42 Pournterfamilias has not skreve, will, and dowandshe went, Hatchettsbury Road! And oil thusly.
4157 2018-03-02 22:04:33 I did, too! Lady at Sprouts one day going on & on abt CBD oil. I finally googled & felt like DUUUUHH!!!! 
4158 2018-03-02 22:04:32 Gladly preaching and closing out the great Tri-State Independent Baptist Preacher’s Fellowship tonight at Open Door Baptist Church, Louisville KY. In need of fresh oil and warm bread.

4159 2018-03-02 22:04:25 But you have to admit, it would've been much easier to make progress if the colonial power's didn't interfere post independence. You know like, rigging elections and owning oil fields...
4160 2018-03-02 22:04:22 iPath S&P GSCI Crude Oil Total Return Index ETN (OIL) price at close, 2018-03-02, is 6.77.

4165 2018-03-02 22:03:46 Bremner is a B.C. Liberal supporter and thus a supporter of big oil and Alberta. #bcpoli
4166 2018-03-02 22:03:44 My facial oil somehow opened itself all over my bag. I got it free but my skin is now addicted - who has recommendations of brands to replace it?

4171 2018-03-02 22:03:24 I agree, the comments were calling her out for this snake oil, but not personal attacks. Wow, the lies just keep coming.
4172 2018-03-02 22:03:22 Hey, @senorrinhatch - how do your constituents like not having affordable healthcare?  AND how do they view your emails showing you sold off Bears Ears for oil &coal interests?  What was your cut?
4173 2018-03-02 22:03:15 Since ancient story telling written in caves, snake oil salesmen, Orson Wells on the radio, Lucille Ball and Jerry Springer we all flocked to entertainment and always will. Good luck with that

4175 2018-03-02 22:03:02 A girl at this restaurant I was just at was singing every. single. word. of a Nickelback song that was on.  I borderline wanted to poke her with my chopsticks
4176 2018-03-02 22:03:01 I am quite sure we could flood the market of steel and open the oil pipelines and there would only be cries of "please stop".

4183 2018-03-02 22:01:54 For sure it's much better than building oil pipe under the see by Germans

4192 2018-03-02 22:00:51 oh... Rexxon & Condi.
Yes.

Bushes do not act like Putin has anything on them. They seem like they want to go out looming above the fray.
Putin has something on Nunes & Ryan. ("Keep it in the family")
But Condi & Putin? 

Yes, oil sales that are under sanctions.

4195 2018-03-02 22:00:38 Normally I agree with you (and maybe do on this one, too), but I don’t see how that’s any different from OPEC controlling the worldwide price of oil (at least back in the day).

4207 2018-03-02 21:59:23 We need to sustain our own needs and stop relying on others. If you like the thought of pipe carrying the needs of oil and gas from India and China to your home,go for it. Me not so much.

4210 2018-03-02 21:58:58 I think you’re quite mistaken... take it from someone in the industry... furthermore, all of the existing onshore has and oil production in the UK (which I’m a huge advocate of) is not ‘shale’ or ‘unconventional’

4218 2018-03-02 21:58:05 My brother misunderstood this and covered himself with olive oil while sitting in the bathtub, now he can't get out
4219 2018-03-02 21:58:00 Had a Chevron oil tanker named after her because everyone in that entire Bush administration worshipped oil, so we went to war over it and killed a lot of people because of it.
4220 2018-03-02 21:57:41 i use "cream deodorant"; it's a paste you mix with oil and then apply with a spatula to your pits. very glamorous.
4221 2018-03-02 21:57:28 Change oil agad agad?
4222 2018-03-02 21:57:26 That man and percentages are like oil and water. I have no clue why he keeps using them.
4223 2018-03-02 21:57:26 All they see is oil.
4224 2018-03-02 21:57:18 Ouch. Stuffing face with large French Fry fried in peanut oil. Instant nap will follow. I forget to eat when editing. Honey, sweet tea,. Twizzlers, chips and cheese if I do eat.

4226 2018-03-02 21:57:16 Usual uninformed #FakeNews - in UK there are 120 onshore oil/gas sites w/250 wells producing 20,000 to 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. First 1896 Heathfield (gas) - 1973 Dorset is largest onshore oilfield in Western Europe. There are 13 in the Weald - some 30 years old
4227 2018-03-02 21:57:15 Also, dude you're talking about rural America when you're from Queens? Get the fuck out of here. We rural folks don't need you costal elites telling us what's good for us.

North Dakota could power half the nation with wind power. 

Coal and oil should be dead.

4231 2018-03-02 21:56:33 Where does @hectordbremner and the #NPA stand on the #KinderMorgan pipeline extension and shipping 7 times more oil out of the Burrard Inlet from Westridge to Asia, just so Alberta can increase oil productivity and carbon consumption? #vanpoli #bcpoli #canpoli
4232 2018-03-02 21:56:28 I got you man. I’ll burn our oil slicks while burning passion in the crowd’s hearts. 
4233 2018-03-02 21:56:25 Why is Lucic in any conversation about a top 6?  Other than the fact the oil is paying him $666666.67/goal this season. Do the math
4234 2018-03-02 21:56:16 Kratom works well for some, though it's banned in a few states. CBD oil may not work well for severe pain. Legalised marijuana would be helpful on a national scale so everyone could have access. It may not meet the needs of all complex pain patients but more options are better.
4235 2018-03-02 21:56:11 Must Nigeria wait till oil becomes invaluable before states start generating its own revenue? Or funding its police and or building infrastructures?

We lack wise people in Nigeria.
4236 2018-03-02 21:56:06 About 40yrs ago, my mates sister asked him for some oil for her car. It took her ages to do. My mate went to find out why, finding her trying to put it in down dip stick hole. Believe me, true story.

4240 2018-03-02 21:55:45 After shampooing your hair pour apple cider vinegar and leave on for like 15 to 20 mins. Rinse out and apply Non stop herbal oil for men on the scalp. It works!

4247 2018-03-02 21:55:08 @realDonaldTrump Suppose I should be grateful u Want to Raise My Social Security Benefits !!! Put My Country into a Recession !!! Increase Imported Oil . Since
4248 2018-03-02 21:54:36 I’m from Calgary, but the guy is probably from Newfoundland which is where most east coast conservatives come from. He likely moved here because it’s a conservative circle jerk that’s horny for oil. Calgary is all shit hipster brew pubs though, so it’s kinda hilarious
4249 2018-03-02 21:54:28 Actually he did get in trouble after the market crashed in 2008/2009 and called before the SEC. Not sure what happened afterwards..maybe fined.
4250 2018-03-02 21:54:26 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
4251 2018-03-02 21:54:07 Gumbo would probably hurt the worst, given the amount of oil in roux. Get it nice and hot and it would be like a Mid-Evil oil dump at Castle gate.
4252 2018-03-02 21:54:01 paid rent, got tested for STDs, getting my oil changed, fixing to hit the taco truck and go check out this pubg patch

4256 2018-03-02 21:53:03 No. I typically boil with olive oil and them toss with olive oil and fresh ground pepper. When extra fancy, I cook pasta in broth.
4257 2018-03-02 21:53:01 Read how Ryan Zinke and Orin Hatch pursued opening up protected Bears Ears for oil drilling- they overturned Obama’s protections saying it was overreach!
But they see only $$$$ and not care for our environment. 
They are real swamp monsters!

4259 2018-03-02 21:52:52 Condi is owned by big oil. Even has a tanker named after her. Worthless during Bush years; irrelevant now. Keep pushing Mr. Schiff.
4260 2018-03-02 21:52:49 Doo gro oil really soothes my scalp with these braids my hair really stopped itching
4261 2018-03-02 21:52:44 .@Reuters But even *that* only hints at the issue.

.@tomfriedman spent the last several years repeatedly reciting that losing your place in the supply chain was "like pouring cement down an oil well."  You never get your place in the supply chain *back.*
4262 2018-03-02 21:52:41 I wouldn't support or donate my hard earned money to any group of muslims. Ask your oil rich brothers for a hand out!
4263 2018-03-02 21:52:40 The trending issue about #Thailand , #Rice and #PMB isn't worth our celebration.I will hail @MBuhari when he stops fuel importation and the countries we import from also wail like #Thailand.
Afterall between Oil import and Rice Import, which one do we spend much on? @ogundamisi
4264 2018-03-02 21:52:40 I totally understand and respect that! If you haven’t yet, check out evening primrose oil. It has been surprisingly effective for me
4265 2018-03-02 21:52:31 You can't be on some ambitious chasing success shit dating somebody who don't got no goals. That's oil and water. 
4266 2018-03-02 21:52:27 When it impacts eastern Canada steel & aluminum Justin comes out swinging but when it involves western Canada oil Justin goes on another vacation...

4276 2018-03-02 21:51:46 Just think how it will look in the inevitable oil spill! winning all the hell over the place.
4277 2018-03-02 21:51:38 Being from temperate Sydney, my biased view was that Melbourne became habitable only after Bass Strait gas (and oil of course) was discovered and central heating became common. Going in reverse now. Maybe heat pumps will rescue us, not much sign yet.

4281 2018-03-02 21:50:51 A $15.00 barrel oil for a year would kill the Russian economy. It almost did not too long ago.
4282 2018-03-02 21:50:42 Southside 2003 with Brian Austin Green.  The always dangerous finals of the north side vs Southside boxing match.  Based is Chicago yet can’t figure where the oil drills that are pumping on screen are actually located at

4288 2018-03-02 21:50:08 Yeah I think that crop mattered for me to get exactly what you were meaning. Ha. Also yeah oil heirs are problematic AF but honestly I think that is a big part of why he tries to avoid talking about how he grew up. I think he knows it’s problematic.
4289 2018-03-02 21:50:02 We're committed to giving you great value on fuel in all of our filling stations. Our prices closely track the crude oil price, we pass on reductions quickly, and shield our customers from dramatic price increases. 2/4
4290 2018-03-02 21:50:01 Take the next step @SecretaryZinke after cancelling the #ChacoCanyon oil/gas lease --  give the land permanent protection!
4291 2018-03-02 21:49:52 Lol thanks
4292 2018-03-02 21:49:51 -ns. Let’s talk about the oil prices, that go down after every war in the oil regions. And if we are at that let’s talk about how western countries helped the hatred between Muslims and Jews to grow.
4293 2018-03-02 21:49:46 Your throne, O God, it's forever and ever. The scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of uprightness; you have loved righteousness and hated wickedness. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions;  (Psalm 45:6-7, ESV)
4294 2018-03-02 21:49:45 وحضرتك من أهل الخير
4295 2018-03-02 21:49:39 So sitting here waiting for my oil change. There is a hallmark movie on and the lead actress is Gretchen Wieners from Mean Girls... glad she ended up better than Lindsay Lohan
4296 2018-03-02 21:49:29 Having a huge plate of steam Veggies , topped with a little extra virgin olive oil and sea salt :)
4297 2018-03-02 21:49:28 According to the TV, if they used Mobil 1, they'd never have to change their oil again.
4298 2018-03-02 21:49:23 The world NEEDS Canadian oil. I will NOT stand against it.

4301 2018-03-02 21:49:04 Do you know what a small amount of land is disrupted by oil drilling sand fracking? Compare that to ranchers grazing sheep or cattle stripping the land and displacing mustangs. 
Blah, blah, blah..blame Trump. 2 more years of Obama and we'd have had the weakest military on earth.

4303 2018-03-02 21:48:47 Southside 2003 with Brian Austin Green.  About Annual Northside vs Southside boxing match.  Based in Chicago but for some reason they have oil drills going resembling somewhere in badlands of a Texas

4307 2018-03-02 21:48:02 I’m at the dealership way to often....they should have stamp card visits and after 5 visits you get like a free oil change or something
4308 2018-03-02 21:47:57 大丈夫大丈夫
4309 2018-03-02 21:47:53 He is right about the glorified spoofing and wrong when he says it is not a violation.....might get him in trouble some day..we did see a algo triggered to get it to 61.60. But doubt it will be enough to stop the downtrend in the coming weeks
4310 2018-03-02 21:47:36 I wanna be in a yacht right now with nothing but food, tanning oil and music
4311 2018-03-02 21:47:23 no longer 5100m past my oil change 
4312 2018-03-02 21:47:16 There has been a symbiotic relationship between Saudi Arabia and the US since the creation of ARAMCO in the 1930s.  We have protected the Saudi royal family in exchange for a dependable oil supply, purchase of Treasury securities and doing our bidding in Middle East.
4313 2018-03-02 21:47:15 Hopefully we put a tariff on oil exported to USA, as we are your biggest supplier of that too.  You’ll feel that at the pumps.
4314 2018-03-02 21:47:08 Not sure if I’m ready to set my car on fire or break my dads hand for rounding off the cap that drains the oil. 
4315 2018-03-02 21:47:01 Red wings apply mink oil ... like slippers after a bit

4318 2018-03-02 21:46:57 haha yea good catch, i edited. same sentiment re: oil heirs needing to be scrutinized, i just cropped out the "but maybe i'm not objective"
4319 2018-03-02 21:46:50 Shampoo & conditioner, beard oil will help & just brush/comb it.  & don’t be picking at it
4320 2018-03-02 21:46:48 Joke's on them; we're never leaving...or at least until their oil fields are carved up and appropriated.

4347 2018-03-02 21:44:06 @NewshubNationNZ I'm really looking forward to the Nats voting for the good of the environment as this seems to be their party line @SimonBridgesNZ It will be refreshing after him giving exploration permits to drop sea oil barons

4359 2018-03-02 21:42:59 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
4360 2018-03-02 21:42:53 Getting our oil to tide water will help greatly. Since the down turn crime has skyrocketed. From rural crime to urban crime to online scams.
4361 2018-03-02 21:42:45 Maybe it's time to start a Go Fund Me fundraiser to buy back the GOP from the NRA and big oil....Ya know they wont budge until you pay them off.

4373 2018-03-02 21:41:37 We are presently on 1.4% GDP growth rate as at 2017!
Don't you think your forecast of 6% is too ambitious?
What specific policies will lead to the l this 6% growth when we still largely depend on Oil exports?
4374 2018-03-02 21:41:05 But it would have been olive oil though wouldn't it?

4383 2018-03-02 21:40:01 i’m casually sitting here waiting for my oil to get changed, minding my own business and two young car salesmen approach me all seductively attempting to sell me a car by flirting with me. it’s like the start of a bad porno. leave me alone.

4388 2018-03-02 21:39:27 .@Reuters We have already hit the key tipping point where new solar/wind are cheaper than new coal plants.

Coal is effectively finished as an energy source - top 4 US producers lost 99% value in 5 years. Gas & oil are on the same path.

4407 2018-03-02 21:38:01 Interesting read. I thought all along this wasn't about states rights. It's all about screwing native Americans rights for the benefit of oil, gas, and coal industries. I'd prefer to see wind farms or solar panels above ground rather than oil wells and open pit coal mines

4417 2018-03-02 21:37:00 Look at all the oil barons brought into and around the administration. This was all planned. Also pulling back the EPA regulations on clean water/air makes it easier to clear contracts. This land belongs to all of us, but oil profits will go to them!

4424 2018-03-02 21:36:25 .@Reuters A sovereign wealth fund can buy up excess barrels to blunt a momentary sell off but does nothing re: basic demand.

And eventually, anyone trying this will run out of money. There are ways to do it, but you can only store so much oil.

4431 2018-03-02 21:35:38 .@Reuters The world uses 80-million+ barrels of oil/day. 5% drop in economy = drop of 4-million+/day. 10% = 8-million+.

Any significant drop in oil demand in, say, 2018 will decimate the industry further.

4480 2018-03-02 21:28:44 Yes, so? The Obama administration's decision to establish Bears Ears National Monument was guided by the desire to prevent drilling for oil and gas.

4487 2018-03-02 21:27:51 I don't recall the figures but basically you can see that our only real options are to stop cutting trees, especially rainforest (fight palm oil!) and stop burning fossils, ASAP. This requires such a realignment of our global economy that I can't see how it can be achieved.

4522 2018-03-02 21:24:17 .@Reuters Assuming you still *want* oil, with clean natural gas generating limitless electricity or pure-silica solar panels.

Clean energy? Raw heat & sand make pure-silica solar panels; less efficient than rare earth, but literally printable… from *sand* #3DPrinting

4524 2018-03-02 21:24:13 The guy who changed my oil today cane up from behind my car asking “what fraternity is on the back of your car”
4525 2018-03-02 21:23:42 I need to get an oil change and my car inspected but I have no motivation to do anything after work 
4526 2018-03-02 21:23:36 Cheap cars are less important than our steel independence. Just like oil.
Without steel production in a war with China, are we gonna buy steel from them?
4527 2018-03-02 21:23:03 Thankfully not here yet. I have several family members without power since this morning. I got lights charging and oil lamps are ready.
4528 2018-03-02 21:23:00 Buy an electric car next. No faffing with gearboxes, oil changes, cam belts, exhausts, brakes and Christ knows what else. Might as well tip money on the fire.

4530 2018-03-02 21:22:58 Good for the lawsuit. Now how can we stop this oil/coal exploration? Can the citizens force a referendum? Can the state protect the land?
4531 2018-03-02 21:22:55 The GOP will be left in the dust unless they embrace the digital age... you know like AI, renewable energy, environmental tech, etc. Coal, steel, and oil are so analogue.
4532 2018-03-02 21:22:48 @PurpulHair oil. Do hot oil treatments also (google)
4533 2018-03-02 21:22:47 Most marketing firms are failing their customers and some are nothing more than snake oil salespeople.

4536 2018-03-02 21:22:12 It looks like a race between @NorgesBank and @riksbanken which one will be the first pulling the trigger. IMO both #NOK and #SEK seem to have decent scope to appreciate going forward, though NOK depends on oil - it may be a risk factor.
4537 2018-03-02 21:22:02 The amount of time I'm spending assigning myself new tasks means the characters have taken over the story in the best possible way. For a change I don't have to be up at 5 a.m., so I'm going to burn the midnight oil. Send caffeine.

4540 2018-03-02 21:21:45 @AkGovBillWalker your Republican budget with its emphasis on cutting social services and hand outs to big oil is a disgrace.

4542 2018-03-02 21:21:37 @bigfatsurprise speaking at #LCB18 on vegetable (industrially processed seed) oils: 1) As heart disease rose, vegetable oil consumption increased dramatically; 2) RCTs conducted in institutions showed no effect of saturated fats on CVD mortality or total mortality.
4543 2018-03-02 21:21:36 Raincoat on for me shortly. Never mind it's worth it. I did marinated feta a while back with a friend of mine who makes cheese it was devine. Full of all kinds of goodies and organic locally produced olive oil. YUM
4544 2018-03-02 21:21:18 What I'm trying to say, is that plants, or rather, industrialised plant crops, are not all that innocent. how many people, how many animal and plant species have suffered or gone extinct already because of expanding soy, corn, palm oil, cotton etc.?

4571 2018-03-02 21:18:08 So then, should Canada just block the Alaska pipeline? You know, the American oil pipeline that runs through Canada's west coast? Each country should seek it's own interests first, right? You do realize that Canada is the largest steel exporter to the US, and you want to do this?
4572 2018-03-02 21:18:05 Yeah. Hydrogen is a non starter unless you looooove drilling for oil and gas. That's why Shell are so keen on it. Totally inefficient and just epic silliness.

4597 2018-03-02 21:14:57 Over the last few years, investment to our oil&gas sector has dropped 60% & still declining. Tax revenue has decreased substantially. So those new jobs are certainly lower paying. Foreign investors aren’t looking at AB anymore. We r supported by massive debt.

4599 2018-03-02 21:14:36 Think longer term...This will help our job market and GDP. Prices may rise bc the tariffs trickle down to us, but competition will drive that price back down.

4649 2018-03-02 21:09:06 Because their purpose is mainly to bully other countries into submission so we can steal their oil and assert our political agendas onto them, and they only say it’s “for our freedom” to con the general population into supporting their modern imperialism but go off 
4650 2018-03-02 21:08:59 America needs to be more self-sufficient. Having our our steel, aluminum, oil, etc insures that we can secure our safety from dictatorship countries like North Korea, China & Russia (that last two about to go that way again).

4664 2018-03-02 21:08:09 Why doesn’t she mind her own goddamned business? Maybe she could go for a joyride on the oil tanker that bears her name.
4665 2018-03-02 21:08:07 おは
4666 2018-03-02 21:08:03 As of right now this oil change is very nerve racking
4667 2018-03-02 21:08:01 shut up... Mourinho hasn't bought 22 players like baldiola.gk defenders striker subs even youth team. wtf.. oil money is indeed working

4669 2018-03-02 21:07:58 Oil revenues will pay for the Iraq war.
4670 2018-03-02 21:07:33 When have the facts ever made a difference to those who sell snake oil?
4671 2018-03-02 21:07:25 @NorthWalesFire Strong smell of either Paraffin/Turps/kerosene enetering home. first noticed it in bathroom. Now it's spreading around my home.  I have oil central heating. emergency council wont do anything and cant get in touch with Morgan Sindall repairs.  Should I be worried?
4672 2018-03-02 21:07:20 “Every day should be started off with a spoonful of castor oil!”
4673 2018-03-02 21:07:18 They don’t have the horses. A team learning to win that hadn’t actually accomplished anything real yet was actively downgraded offensively multiple times. As far as the preds game, you’re not wrong, but the days of the small victory (we hung with a great team) should be behind us

4675 2018-03-02 21:07:09 Oil – $356 billion.
Machines, Engines, Pumps – $330 billion.
Electronic Equipment – $319 billion.
Vehicles – $265 billion.
Medical Equipment – $76 billion.
Pharmaceuticals – $73 billion.  How does effect your budget?
4676 2018-03-02 21:07:08 That #3 Chevy looks bad fast and so gorgeous can’t wait to see you back at Vegas in September! Wish you luck!
4677 2018-03-02 21:06:56 Is the real problem the American auto industry? Or possibly our dependence on oil?
4678 2018-03-02 21:06:54 National parks and land are some of the greatest features in the USA don't ruin them for oil, why not look at renewable energy.
4679 2018-03-02 21:06:52 like every flaxseed supplement has it and it's like... i want to take this.. because i can't eat fish oil.... BUT I CAN'T EAT GELATIN EITHER SO WHY IS THAT IN HERE!!!!!!!
4680 2018-03-02 21:06:40 The SOS or the oil tanker?

4682 2018-03-02 21:06:21 Coconut Oil saves lives
4683 2018-03-02 21:05:54 Bison ranching is expanding. Sheep are vulnerable (we have wolves and grizzlies), cattle are stupid - but comparatively easy to handle. And here's your dilemma: if the land's not being grazed, pressure for oil, gas, and coal development increases.
4684 2018-03-02 21:05:54 U.S. Rig Count is up 3 rigs from last week to 981, with #oil rigs up 1 to 800, #gas rigs up 2 to 181, and miscellaneous rigs unchanged. $OSX $OIH $USO
4685 2018-03-02 21:05:34 Most affordable place to get an oil change?

4688 2018-03-02 21:04:51 Indy ASAP, cannot allow the fascist's of the far right conkip party to destroy Scotland! The UK had over 300 years to give us prosperity, all the UK has gave us is their right to asset strip Scotland to pay England's massive debt, and squandered over 300 billion of oil revenues!!
4689 2018-03-02 21:04:49 Someone please get nina Jamaican black castor oil
4690 2018-03-02 21:04:47 Like PMs tax law, elimination of oil sands, legalized drugs.
4691 2018-03-02 21:04:26 of  course local content must always be the first priority if we are to benefit in this rain  of Oil that is falling we have too
4692 2018-03-02 21:04:24 It’s my face  I use coconut oil for make up remover but I always forget about using it as a moisturizer 
4693 2018-03-02 21:04:24 someone give me advice on how to oil paint a face on canvas heh
4694 2018-03-02 21:04:15 Dr. Google tells me peppermint oil can be used as a deterrent as they reportedly hate that smell.
4695 2018-03-02 21:04:07 God damn you mollahs!  
These people are sitting on an ocean of oil and gas!
Why should they go through so much suffering and despair?
You mollahs are the ugliest scums that have ever walked on earth!
4696 2018-03-02 21:04:04 another WINNING quote from PM Butts over there.
I don't think President Trump was implying that our steel was "dangerous," Justin, I think Trump is protecting American industries, jobs and making competitive tariffs. We need to be developing our OWN industries JT,Oil&Gas #cdnpoli

4699 2018-03-02 21:03:54 What to use in Lieu of Pesticides? Neem Oil, Garlic & Clove Oil, Azatrol, StrawFlower Extract... the list goes on!
4700 2018-03-02 21:03:36 NOTE TO SELF. Don't drink chili oil, ever again.
4701 2018-03-02 21:03:33 the thing is i just won't buy coconut oil on principle
4702 2018-03-02 21:03:16 When I fried up those mozerella sticks, I reignited the hot oil of war.

4705 2018-03-02 21:03:12 do the spices in the oil first, then add onions. garlic comes later. reduce the veggies. add your protein. serve over rice.

you were asking about curry right?
4706 2018-03-02 21:03:08 Listen babes, if your not using castor oil in your beauty ruitine hear me out, my hair is stronger, my eyelashes are thicker and my strech marks are going away.
Get a big ass bottle at a health store for $8
 Slather that shit everywhere 
I got you
4707 2018-03-02 21:02:58 Because no other country wants canadian sludge oil. It requires dilution of light crude for processing into gasoline. Only USA can refine at reduced cost. Any reduction would need to be doubled for overs3as to account for transport cost...and it still requires dilution
4708 2018-03-02 21:02:53 fresh shaved legs covered in coconut oil
4709 2018-03-02 21:02:51 Just now, opening a beer without an opener but my hand slipped and my index finger caught on the lifted cap so a I now have a hole there and the other day I literally slice way a chunk of my middle finger on a can with coconut oil.

4715 2018-03-02 21:02:37 wow I love being approached by gross older men in a Walmart McDonald's while I'm just waiting for my oil change like yes please make my life more uncomfortable than it already is
4716 2018-03-02 21:02:31 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*
4717 2018-03-02 21:02:15 what better use of an old oil drum, I bet they get through it. its hard that the reputation of many gamekeepers that nurture the countryside is tarnished by a few wrongdoers. rspb do commend good gamekeeping but it can be overlooked by bad press which is so sad
4718 2018-03-02 21:02:12 Good Luck !
4719 2018-03-02 21:01:44 Got a new CBD bottle today with coconut oil which really helps it work faster. Really recommend it for anxiety, lack of sleep,or pains/aches
4720 2018-03-02 21:01:38 I didn't need to see this to sniff out the BS. We knew from the start that it was either:
A. Obama
B. Oil
4721 2018-03-02 21:01:37 Love that. Diffusing oil sounds so calming.
4722 2018-03-02 21:01:29 Which means the motivation to make it all off limits was to make the U.S. dependent on foreign oil?
4723 2018-03-02 21:01:24 Sounds like a good start. Lavenders a favourite oil of mine, and had a small portable stick of it with geranium- great combination.

4726 2018-03-02 21:01:02 Sitting at the dealership waiting to get my oil changed for my trip up to flagstaff tomorrow! Looking forward to my 7 hour long hike
4727 2018-03-02 21:01:01 If you’re getting an oil change at @jiffylube, may I recommend that you NOT drink their coffee. It might just be the used motor oil.

4728 2018-03-02 21:00:59 How many unarmed Dakota Soix did you shoot with rubber bullets, used dogs, flash bang grenades, water cannons in freezing temps.
Loudspeakers all night at their camp.

You're pretty much a Monster?

Then you had an oil spill already. 
Just like the Soix said.

Sick greed.

4730 2018-03-02 21:00:54 The solution to a trade imbalance is to create something of value that other countries want. When we devalue education, limit research, regress back to coal, oil and gas... we’re building nothing of value! Tariffs are short-term fixes, a bandaid on a gaping wound.
4731 2018-03-02 21:00:51 There is simply little chance of gas there, but there is a lot of oil hence Balcombe, Leith Hill etc. You can't do anything about the geology
4732 2018-03-02 21:00:40 Vitamin E oil.. Clarins has great oils and serums.. I love this argan oil that I get from Canada, it’s worked wonders!!!

4742 2018-03-02 20:59:42 In principle I agree w this but that’s not the way our gov works. R’s attack enemy political organizations like unions, Ds do it to ours like Koch/oil w EPA etc. Delta showed themselves to be partisan so they got treated that way.

4745 2018-03-02 20:58:50 Jason I love your passion and the only thing that could possibly improve your abilities is CBD oil in large quantities.
4746 2018-03-02 20:58:37 no better feeling than knowing you have oil beer and comfort at your house and no work for 2 days.
4747 2018-03-02 20:58:12 The @abqjournal's Ryan Flynn defense was not a  only an ethical embarrassment, but a journalistic one too, replete with passive voice, unnamed “prosecutors” and authors, and use of an oil and gas flak as an authority on the entire criminal justice system's treatment of Flynn
4748 2018-03-02 20:58:11 Oil, oil, oil, I assume. As stated below, thanks for the transparency on this one thing: meetings with people you want to stand next to. Can you do something to represent your constituents' issues, please? You have given me about a 2% representation and you refuse to meet us.
4749 2018-03-02 20:58:09 Let’s see how much this oil change about to run me 
4750 2018-03-02 20:57:34 That is obviously wrong. The documents state that it was done for Oil, and for money.
4751 2018-03-02 20:57:31 Oil and water can never mix. Just like me and some people
4752 2018-03-02 20:57:22 My first O level... taken 1 year before  English.     Memories of Cerebus and Roman soldiers scraping each other with oil
4753 2018-03-02 20:56:57 Nigeria supposed to be among Industrialized Nation's in d world if we had utilized Crude Oil Availability for Industrial growth.
4754 2018-03-02 20:56:51 @AudiUKCare also the car was supposed to have had a gear box oil change at 38k, which wasn’t done....we bought the car from them at 45k miles and on its recent service they tried to charge us for the oil change, surely this should have been done before it was sold to us!
4755 2018-03-02 20:56:50 That's probably good, as the sugar and milk gum up the rifles. The gun oil makes the coffee taste weird, too.
4756 2018-03-02 20:56:38 just splashed hot oil onto my eyelid how’s ur day going
4757 2018-03-02 20:56:30 Finally got my oil changed my lazy butt has been putting it off for the last 2 months 
4758 2018-03-02 20:56:26 Oil Was Central in Decision to Shrink Bears Ears Monument, we know.  
How disgraceful @RyanZinke.
4759 2018-03-02 20:56:23 ...oh and left three 10 gallon drums of used motor oil in the garage.

4761 2018-03-02 20:56:11 I pray to get thru day. I've never been trusting; (for ex: at oil change; im lkg under car to make sure oil coming out). Plus the Shadow banning here (also i hear they send fake neg comments). Plus the hopelessness not ever having normal life. And everything else ti's deal with.
4762 2018-03-02 20:56:05 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
4763 2018-03-02 20:56:00 If not Famfa oil it would have gone to Shell, Chevron, Texaco, Mobil etc. At least a Nigerian got involved in this for the long term. 
By the way Chevron, Petrobras, Texaco Statoil and NNPC are partners in this block. Why do we hate the Nigerian only?
4764 2018-03-02 20:55:54 Might be a good thing to help rinse away all that leaking Oil being piped through the Keystone pipeline underground?? 
4765 2018-03-02 20:55:38 I don’t know anything about you, but talking about oil money surely you lean towards one of the old sky4 clubs that have been displaced by city
4766 2018-03-02 20:55:28 Just tax the hell out of US-exported oil. Win/Win
4767 2018-03-02 20:55:11 Rice is a Republican hack with close ties to the oil industry (Chevron named an oil tanker after her). She was the worst NSA adviser in history (9/11) until Mike Flynn. Rice was an absent Sec. of State who accomplished nothing. Who can forget her shoe buying spree during Katrina?
4768 2018-03-02 20:55:00 I think we’re unlikely to see the super high dollar oil jobs any more. Alberta also needs to get off the boom/bust cycle.
4769 2018-03-02 20:54:54 مش فاضية
4770 2018-03-02 20:54:48 Yes, they were rich because of the oil business that J. R. Ewing was the founder/CEO for.
4771 2018-03-02 20:54:44 Rachel is NBC just going to have to provide a cot in your office because the scandals won’t slow down??? Literally we have popped so much popcorn to watch your nightly coverage we need more oil 
4772 2018-03-02 20:54:44 
4773 2018-03-02 20:54:36 That’s definitely a little oil dropper, I’ve got one like it.
4774 2018-03-02 20:54:30 Oil and powder can't stop us !!!!

4781 2018-03-02 20:53:07 Stocks were recovering. Oil was on the rise. Steel was holding steady. Maybe he talked to Trump & felt the President was about to do something stupid & unloaded. Insider trading? SEC would have to investigate.
4782 2018-03-02 20:52:49 Sponge bob kills me when he says holy oil spill 
4783 2018-03-02 20:52:46 Now that I’m on SOS free I’ve realized that everything has processed salt, oil + sugar.

4787 2018-03-02 20:52:33 My day went from awesome to complete shit my car stopped working on my way to a oil change place and I've never had this happen so now I'm waiting to see what is wrong
4788 2018-03-02 20:52:26 Just a clarification, the crude oil shipped to the US almost exclusively goes via a pipeline that starts at Sumas and goes into the US. The rail link to those refineries is primarily from the south and is predominantly US Bakken light crude
4789 2018-03-02 20:52:26 You might want to give grape seed oil or avocado oil a try too
4790 2018-03-02 20:52:25 Time to sit at the Chevy dealership for at least an hour for a damn oil change 
4791 2018-03-02 20:52:25 Unfortunately CPW gets hushed up by big oil and gas corp like everyone else
4792 2018-03-02 20:52:16 In the waiting room while my car get's an oil change. I look up when the lady on tv says she's turning 50 because I have to think about those things now.

4798 2018-03-02 20:51:38 As a Saskatchewan farmer I am one of the people who has the MOST to lose from runaway climate change.  Get your head in the game Premier - we need to do our part and you need to start serving your people, not just the ones in the oil business.
4799 2018-03-02 20:51:32 The Restoration of Rep of Biafra by President Trump soon will strengthen American economic power in the  world as US oil companies would take over Biafra oil industry  European oil companies would be expelled  to have voted against America and Israel @ UNGA on Jerusalem
4800 2018-03-02 20:51:28 Yes I have made this point many times. The 1973 oil embargo by the Arab states on Western Europe and America explains this. Later there was another one in 1979, the West is dancing to Islam's tune cause of oil. And the money they get from Mosques etc etc.
4801 2018-03-02 20:51:20 Of course,we use white paint,we fire them to make them strong

4805 2018-03-02 20:51:15 Well, that and who the f__k was Billy Graham, both... I mean.... Who WAS Billy Graham?... ( Aha!.. A story!  )...
Seriously, though... He was a man who made a living selling snake oil... At SOME point we gotta wrestle thees silliness to the ground, no?
4806 2018-03-02 20:51:11 That's second lieutenant Richardson if I've got anything to do with it and no ofc not it has to be just... or for oil
4807 2018-03-02 20:51:07 You are a liar and betrayed Utah and your country. Your legacy will be selling out the people of Utah who supported you for Trump's oil and coal in our beautiful parks. You should be ashamed. @senorrinhatch
4808 2018-03-02 20:50:44 And I MUST bake a cake for a gay wedding?
4809 2018-03-02 20:50:43 Some of the wet roads today was slicked with oil and it made me feel like I was in The Shimmer. #Annihilation
4810 2018-03-02 20:50:32 Dad forgot to order the oil  comes on Tuesday. Mum sent him out to buy portable heaters for me plus I have an electric cat bed. So I’m alright jack *smug ears*
4811 2018-03-02 20:50:24 Omo cele osa mo ijo dada @aunty_temi
4812 2018-03-02 20:50:05 Time to fill my nose with coconut oil
4813 2018-03-02 20:50:04 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
4814 2018-03-02 20:49:36 Bruhhhh i need an oil change and everybody booked 
4815 2018-03-02 20:49:34 Lol
4816 2018-03-02 20:49:27 How many loads of laundry you got going on a weekend? 
Have you checked your oil?
4817 2018-03-02 20:49:24 I put my essential oil diffuser on high so that more mist comes out and it looks like I hotboxed my room lmfaooo
4818 2018-03-02 20:49:16 Do u paint dem?
4819 2018-03-02 20:49:13 "fanart" sounds so underwhelming, like imagine someone going up to you like "Hey I made some fanart!" and he pulls out one of the most detailed and masterful oil paintings you've ever seen
4820 2018-03-02 20:49:12 You do realize the most points doesn't equal Hart, right? lol

McD doesn't get a sniff unfortunately due to where the oil stand IMO... although crazier things have happened.
4821 2018-03-02 20:49:09 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
4822 2018-03-02 20:49:05 Yes you are. It's called LOC method, Liquid, Oil and Cream. You can substitute water for water based products
4823 2018-03-02 20:49:03 How is it nearly 9 o'clock and I've still got to cook? I have pasta, prawns, oil, parsley and garlic. Apologies if you are near me at the match tomorrow!
4824 2018-03-02 20:48:59 I would also wager that Calgary's corporate sponsorship & suite sales are also some of the highest in the NHL, this is an oil town after all & money flows quite freely.
4825 2018-03-02 20:48:56 fiancé’s mum gave clove oil to apply it to my wisdom gum and i gotta say it taste the WORST, i could taste it at my throat rn
4826 2018-03-02 20:48:53 Two bottles of olive oil congealed.. rapeseed oil, absolutely fine... a very bizarre occurence
4827 2018-03-02 20:48:52 You mean the oil and gas companies ready to destroy it?
4828 2018-03-02 20:48:40 Tone down the oil. You aren't the Tongan from the Olympics. #BYUSN
4829 2018-03-02 20:48:36 @VinnieTortorich Deep fried chicken wings in a healthy oil with no breading. In or out? #nsng
4830 2018-03-02 20:48:33 When late #DavidShepherd started his series of Wildlife paintings in (Ea) Africa back in the 60's, I forked out many shillings for his 1st Art book (still have it @ home!). My (Oil Coy) employers commissioned several originals for the Executive floor!
4831 2018-03-02 20:48:31 This rain has me in the mood for a hot oil treatment, face mask & body scrub 
4832 2018-03-02 20:48:14 Just got done wit my boy’s beamer , hmu for an oil change or tune up ! Yee I do transmission fluids as well and radiator flushes 
4833 2018-03-02 20:47:54 A) Why not offer a rebuttal that contains something the PM can do,  If one exists B) An alternative economy is the best answer for AB.. no other province relies on one thing the way AB relies on oil. It leaves you too exposed to market fluctuations, and kills the environment.
4834 2018-03-02 20:47:49 @seanhannity would you or Fox ever expose US money paid to environmentalists to stop Canadian oil to get to market?  Are these same companies paying for protests for the oil leaving the US coast. Were these companies outraged when the gulf oil spill happend #Hilary4prison
4835 2018-03-02 20:47:47 @ILDeptofRevenue Do you collect oil production data?  If so, do you have it available by county?
4836 2018-03-02 20:47:21 GorT: Hmm, looks like I need to go buy more oil for the home generator….thought I had some
4837 2018-03-02 20:47:11 Infrastructure is coming up. Look at the great state of Texas and what the oil gas taxes has done for their schools and roads. 85mph and lead the nation in quality/ safety. Unleash this third pillar of Trumps agenda and not only do you overtake Putin but save on infrastructure.
4838 2018-03-02 20:47:07 I do. ONLY speaking for myself, MY Chinese restaurant's wings are BIG whole wings and are fried in like peanut oil or some other type of oil other than vegetable oil. It gives it a great taste.
4839 2018-03-02 20:46:58 My point:
The Middle East sells us more oil, than they buy from us. This would be considered unfair trade, because they don’t buy the same amount from us. Inequality you’d say. This is why it’s a dumb socialist policy & Bernie loves it.
4840 2018-03-02 20:46:56 This is exactly the type of crap the anti-opioid hysteria is pushing. Don't take this evil drug that works, here have something we said was quackery for centuries. And the FDA formed against that snake oil is helping to push it now.
4841 2018-03-02 20:46:54 yess that me lol. pick up some sunflower lecithin too!! it makes it more potent/kick in stronger. u only need 1 or 2 tsp per cup of oil.
4842 2018-03-02 20:46:53 Pour olive oil into a bowl of water held by a women hexed by a neighbour. .if the oil separates. .
4843 2018-03-02 20:46:48 Maybe he should do a check on S. Africa, just a guess
4844 2018-03-02 20:46:43 Yeah, I'm giving up all oil too. Just want to see how my body responds to no processed carbs or oils. Lot of veggies, lean meats, sweet potatoes.
4845 2018-03-02 20:46:38 Sheldon Whitehouse, Pruitt is an idiot who is only interested in what money he can receive from his big oil,gas & coal buddies. He is not interested in saving the environment but is for destroying it. Fire him for dereliction of duties.
4846 2018-03-02 20:46:28 But the Saudis have been flooding the market with cheap oil for decades...when will those tariffs...oh hey guys how did you get in here?
4847 2018-03-02 20:46:20 oil and shoe-leather, apparently. 
Or, the oil was converted to gold thread.
4848 2018-03-02 20:46:07 “Donald took me by the hand and lead me to a forest clearing.  It smelled of burnt motor oil.  He whispered “The owls are not what they seem.  Do you want to play with fire?  Do you want to play with BOB”.  Then I was in a room with a floating head of Jared....”
4849 2018-03-02 20:45:49 Nice rally, let’s add some oil tariffs now
4850 2018-03-02 20:45:41 Now is the time to ramp up production in our own country. Just like the oil industry.
4851 2018-03-02 20:45:39 Ich dachte diese Hackergruppe heißt Snake Oil?! naja whatever... Hauptsache Leningrad!
4852 2018-03-02 20:45:35 i finally found this castor oil i been looking for forever 
4853 2018-03-02 20:45:28 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
4854 2018-03-02 20:44:58 @CookingLight I can believe you are promoting Palm Oil use!! Use of palm oil in food products  has encouraged wider cultivation, leading to the clearing of forests in parts of Indonesia and Malaysia to make space for oil-palm, resulted in significant acreage losses of orangutan
4855 2018-03-02 20:44:38 do you use coconut oil??
4856 2018-03-02 20:44:16 หวัง  มาอีกคนแล้ว
4857 2018-03-02 20:44:11 It’s lit because like the oil jawn you can be out widdit in public and it get you higher than smoking but without the harshness(I like the harsh) so I alternate between them really,the vape save way more bud so that’s a plus too
4858 2018-03-02 20:44:01 To heal a pimple quickly, apply tea tree oil on pimple every few hours, and apply vitamin E oil on the spot, about 1 hour before bedtime.
4859 2018-03-02 20:43:45 the black castor & flaxseed oil eco styler smells sooooo good i can’t wait to use it i’m excited lol
4860 2018-03-02 20:43:25 @scifri Snake Oil? Was there really such a thing?
4861 2018-03-02 20:43:14 The snake oil salesman,  Scott Coker, will do anything for a buck...
Kimbo, DaDa, now Chuck??

4866 2018-03-02 20:42:38 Ugh...home still smells like oil from making fried chicken..that was 3 days ago 
4867 2018-03-02 20:42:33 Trump likes expanding oil production at any cost, denies climate change. We want to be associated with those policies?
4868 2018-03-02 20:42:32 I think it's important for the U.S. not to depend on other countries for things like oil & steel.
4869 2018-03-02 20:42:24 ㅠㅠㅠ 저도요
4870 2018-03-02 20:42:07 lmk how desi food is dripping with oil and aunties are out here putting three servings of chaval on my plate but i LOVE IT
4871 2018-03-02 20:41:49 Oil output in the USA is the highest it's ever been.
4872 2018-03-02 20:41:36 It means Colorado gov cares more about oil and gas than about keeping our skyline clear from pollution.
4873 2018-03-02 20:41:31 I’m missing your point. 

We still import Saudi Oil as out Refineries are set up for Heavy Crude. We export Light Crude to others. 

‘Trade’
4874 2018-03-02 20:41:22 Finally home,Alhamdulillah
4875 2018-03-02 20:41:08 Raw coconut oil and Dr. Bonner
4876 2018-03-02 20:40:51 fam i assumed it was a reference to olive oil til i realized that color ain’t make sense so i was like “very moisturized. got it”
4877 2018-03-02 20:40:38 oil over etching on paper
4878 2018-03-02 20:40:29 ooooh. how are those? i thought about getting one and leaving smoking alone. this oil one be going up though.
4879 2018-03-02 20:40:28 I meant...What’s (at the boys place Newmarket)?
4880 2018-03-02 20:40:20 @scifri hi! does the book explore other ancient cultural "oil" such as those in the Far East or Native American?
4881 2018-03-02 20:40:20 No. You are taking steps to destroy Canada's economy. Millions of barrels of oil are shipped each day world-wide without incident. Stop with the hyperbole and fearmongering. #bcpoli #KinderMorgan
4882 2018-03-02 20:40:11 迷うなあサラダ油なの？ごま油なの？どっちが好きなの？
4883 2018-03-02 20:40:06 Tillerson and Texaco are best buds with Putin and Russian oil oligarchs so it's possible that Trump asked Tillerson to ask Rice to say that the House investigation should be shut down. Still, it's surprising she agreed.
4884 2018-03-02 20:40:03 Liked superstars until the whole Jody Shekter using oil to lubricate his Squat thrusts spoilt it for me..#cheatersneverwin
4885 2018-03-02 20:40:03 @WalesOnline We were the only company pulling fuel out of the refinery at Valero, Pembroke Dock today. We pulled together as a family during these extreme conditions by delivering heating oil drums where our tankers couldn't go! We're proud to serve Wales as best as we can!
4886 2018-03-02 20:40:02 I'm not sure about confusion.  Maybe just caution.  Don't want to get caught in the early 2016 situation again.  Having to drop rigs, layoff people.  Seems like we used to look at monthly trends more.  Now weekly.  Oil just hit $66 4 weeks ago.
4887 2018-03-02 20:39:56 I believe peak uranium is approaching, same as peak oil. It's true modern tech is a partial answer. A very expensive one though. The cost of the proposed Hinkley plant could build three times the generation capacity if invested in wind power.
4888 2018-03-02 20:39:52 I just lathered myself in rosehip and vitiman oil and I feel like a greasy, but very well moisturized, goddess. Btw, rosehip oil is amazing for fading acne marks. It's my favorite thing ever.
4889 2018-03-02 20:39:52 Honey is the new coconut oil. Put that shit on everything lmao. Honey salmon is 
4890 2018-03-02 20:39:50 @jiffylube where the Mgr takes each person into a private area to sell you more services.  Common' we want our oil changed. In and out!
4891 2018-03-02 20:39:49 One of the things they don't tell you about growing up is that your dreams start being about olive oil going on special.
4892 2018-03-02 20:39:36 they don't oil 'em like they used to!
4893 2018-03-02 20:39:31 The oil money argument is done to death, try coming up with more creative ideas to cover your clubs failings
4894 2018-03-02 20:39:31 Fancy. Does it come with oil lanterns?
4895 2018-03-02 20:39:29 Sorry,we had a trade war over oil, NO more, ended WELL,  Steel & Alum. MUST come back, GE Jet Eng. MUST come back. Trade deals MUST insure a balance at a min, but should be back in our favor. NOW it is Billions going out of the country. That must stop. Trump setup negot position
4896 2018-03-02 20:39:24 Oil and Natural gas are king.  I didn't say they weren't. My point was, we were energy self sufficient 8 years ago. That's not the issue right now and is in part why gas prices are so low. Note i say, in part.
4897 2018-03-02 20:39:14 when they’re all browned and out of the pot, drop the garlic cloves in the oil/fat and move em around till they just start to gain some color, then pour an entire bottle of red wine in there and bring it to a low boil. while that’s happening, preheat your oven to 325
4898 2018-03-02 20:39:03 USD CFTC Crude Oil speculative net positions diumumkan : 704.1K sebelumnya : 689.4K
4899 2018-03-02 20:39:01 Okay so BOOM .... Before you get out the shower get you some coconut oil and rub it all over then dry off thank me later
4900 2018-03-02 20:39:00 In 2013,Nigeria ranked fourth in global crude oil supply outages.
4901 2018-03-02 20:38:51 I’m hoping my power doesn’t go out. But I’m charging lamps and everything so I’m Prepared for it. I even got my oil burning lamps ready.
4902 2018-03-02 20:38:50 This is why city will never get proper credit from rival fans when they win trophies cos they got lucky in 2008 when they won the lotto and got all that oil money. This could have been any other club hence why it’ll always be thrown at them. It’s plastic.
4903 2018-03-02 20:38:42 I just took the time to oil my scalp, I’m a new bitch 
4904 2018-03-02 20:38:38 @BBCWalesNews We were the only company pulling fuel out of the refinery at Valero, Pembroke Dock today.We pulled together as a family during these extreme conditions by delivering heating oil drums where our tankers couldn't go! We're proud to serve Wales as best as we can!
4905 2018-03-02 20:38:31 Now if WE can just expand this trend towards the oil industry, industrialized agriculture, and the timber industry.
4906 2018-03-02 20:38:28 Snake oil salesmen, the lot of them
4907 2018-03-02 20:38:28 Mine looks like I dumped oil on it after one day how the fuck can you go for so long even with dry shampoo
4908 2018-03-02 20:38:23 No mirrors in her hoose  jeez she's no oil painting herself .
4909 2018-03-02 20:38:10 Micellar oil cleanser  works on heavy eye makeup ! Perfect combination skin wash off cleanser 
4910 2018-03-02 20:38:06 I think you’re talking supporting oil for ourselves. OPEC countries & the gulf hardly import any oil from us. 
Trade imbalance...
4911 2018-03-02 20:38:03 The Outdoor Retailers convention left Salt Lake City for Denver after the Utah Legislature repeatedly voted to favor coal/oil/fracking over preservation/recreation.
4912 2018-03-02 20:37:55 Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight, they're the ones benefiting. Not the oil companies that make you rich. Gotcha.
4913 2018-03-02 20:37:54 This peppermint oil so fucking strong
4914 2018-03-02 20:37:39 gently smash the garlic. get some olive oil going over medium high heat in a heavy pot, and brown the short ribs on the two big flat sides, a couple at a time, pulling them out to a bowl as they brown.
4915 2018-03-02 20:37:33 Don’t forget oil & gas industry. They may be at the top.
4916 2018-03-02 20:37:22 Day 2: New in the past year? Finished my manuscript, my grandpa died, some other rough life issues, met with some agents, tried CBD oil for migraines, set up my website, and started rewriting said manuscript, just to name a few lol #MythMadnessWIP
4917 2018-03-02 20:37:08 @Oreo can you guys like…not have palm oil
i love oreos but orangutans need somewhere to live
thanks
4918 2018-03-02 20:37:03 I got home and lather myself in olive oil ready to soak in some sun & as soon as I step outside the clouds roll in, ouch
4919 2018-03-02 20:36:53 then I would contend (and do so in a forthcoming piece) that broad egalitarianism is impossible to achieve regardless of social movements when the resources that underpin an economy are inherently easy to concentrate and withhold, like irrigation water in arid regions or oil
4920 2018-03-02 20:36:51 And just imagine the sounds that upset stomach would make with a heavy load of oil~
4921 2018-03-02 20:36:43 Just went for an oil change and winded up spending more than 150+  why do I do this to myself
4922 2018-03-02 20:36:40 1) We will NEVER reach peak Guardian. Like Peak Oil, it's a myth.
2) They report *counting* 751,527 pairs of penguins. That's a rather precise number, isn't it? And how do they know that one or two of the "pairs" weren't just good friends?
4923 2018-03-02 20:36:36 Between 2010 and 2013 solar energy alone saw a 500 percent increase in federal subsidies from $1.1 billion to $5.3 billion. Renewables actually increase the cost of energy. This cost, however, is transferred from the energy consumer to the taxpayer. Oil and natural gas are king.
4924 2018-03-02 20:36:25  oil!?
4925 2018-03-02 20:36:24 I think you mean England takes 52%of its fish 52%gas and 86% oil from Scotland cos they sure as shit don't pay for it... #resourcesrobbery
4926 2018-03-02 20:36:22 Stacy’s first oil change 
4927 2018-03-02 20:36:16 Hmm, and how much is impacted by oil spills/fracking...you know, what your father is trying to start in National Park's...fracking
4928 2018-03-02 20:36:10 There’s too much oil in that indomie sef
4929 2018-03-02 20:36:06 My 88 year old grandma broke her arm when she was little, at the growth plate. Her mom would rub olive oil on her arm and sit her in the sun for an hour or two with the oil, hoping to keep her arm growing, despite her doctor saying it wouldn't. (It did). Was this a big fad?
4930 2018-03-02 20:35:59 Thank you @Chrysler for making the 3.6L Pentastar a joy service! Locating the oil filter at the top of the engine, where it is easily accessed, and placing the oil drain plug to drain the oil completely, even with the vehicle on ramps, speaks to the foresight of your engineers.
4931 2018-03-02 20:35:53 تسجيل قضية إهانة موظف وإتلاف ضد مقيمة إيرانية سحبت هاتف رجل أمن من يده وكسرته وتطاولت عليه بقولها «والله لا أجرجرك بالمحاكم» بعدما استوقفها مع فتاة وشاب وطلب إثباتاتهم.
4932 2018-03-02 20:35:38 I get all that. The problem is, we let the trade deficit get to far out of hand. It needs to be fixed. Do we really want foreign countries to bankrupt our key domestic Industries? We fought a war over oil. I hope we have learned our lesson since then.
4933 2018-03-02 20:35:35 100% agree! I worked on many apps for oil and gas companies using HTML frameworks and they looked horrendous. But the client was satisfied because it worked.
4934 2018-03-02 20:35:21 BTW @Jack_Septic_Eye your keys seem to be getting sticky you might need to get yourself some valve oil!!
4935 2018-03-02 20:35:20 I always get asked “ How is your skin so soft and perfect, shiny with no acne at all... And imma tell ya it’s honestly my skin routine that I do everyday. Rose water, Bamboo oil, with cucumber. 
4936 2018-03-02 20:35:14 "oil and vinegar are liquid, kind of like water?"
Same conversation, 45 seconds later:
"You can never be who you were before."
4937 2018-03-02 20:35:14 I love my prius but having to dish out $60+ on an oil change fu king hurts everytime
4938 2018-03-02 20:35:11 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?
4939 2018-03-02 20:35:11 super easy shopping list: olive oil, garlic, rosemary, canned diced maters, mater paste, a bottle of red wine, a quantity of beef stock, and, say, 6 or 8 beef short ribs
4940 2018-03-02 20:35:04 finally got an oil change
4941 2018-03-02 20:35:02 #hope is a great tool. Because you need to trust and believe in yourself.  NOT the #Oil #salesman who making promises only for their own #Interest not for anyone else.
4942 2018-03-02 20:35:01 U guys are the largest producer of oil, but face 4 months of oil scarcity? Is the something to b proud of?
4943 2018-03-02 20:34:51 Atleast Man City have the fans to fund their future when all the oil runs out.
4944 2018-03-02 20:34:49 It’s so funny when people ask me what I put in my hair. I’m always like ummm....water. maybe some oil  I really hate products.
4945 2018-03-02 20:34:47 Me to Condie:  You invaded Iraq on phony intel just to try to steal its oil.
4946 2018-03-02 20:34:13 Can't companies who need steel as an input to their products just hedge the increased cost? Like how airlines hedge their oil costs? Is that possible? Not sure how those things work, to be completely honest.
4947 2018-03-02 20:34:03 I'm so dumb  forgot the fuckin oil filter 
4948 2018-03-02 20:33:55 It’s the more environmentally friendly method to dispose of used frying oil  ;)
4949 2018-03-02 20:33:52 So, my girlfriend has toothache, so she’s asked me to go pick some form of oil up for her to alleviate the pain. Oil? Yes, I also questioned this, but being the nice guy that I am, I take her word for it, and begin my intrepid journey for this oil.
4950 2018-03-02 20:33:50 I wish that my nightstand wasn’t so cluttered so I could put my oil diffuser on it because one day I just put a bunch of woody/earthy scents in it and then clove and cinnamon and just listened to Wicca Phase and got stoned and laid in bed all day and it was the best day ever, tbh
4951 2018-03-02 20:33:49 My concern would be for your long term economic future, as we move further away from fossil fools, your oil reserves will only support you for so long. I don't want to see anything bad happen to our neighbours and I don't the us and them mentality to be enforced
4952 2018-03-02 20:33:45 I don't think Trump has a clue on what he says:) Anyway someone is trying very hard to get it above 61.39 for end of day/week. Is that Pierre?:)
4953 2018-03-02 20:33:28 As soon as we hit "fuck you money" (ha ha ha we make VR games lolololol) I will 100% commission oil paintings from both of you. But you have to store them for 6 mos 'till they dry because FUCK THAT LINDSEED OIL SHIT
4954 2018-03-02 20:33:06 Qatar oil and Geo
4955 2018-03-02 20:32:37 Oil. We need to build more oil plants with scrubbers.
4956 2018-03-02 20:32:28 yes omg and vaseline or coconut oil don’t b helping either 
4957 2018-03-02 20:32:22 How about saving the gas and oil industry! It’s quickly leaving Canada and heading south of the border.
4958 2018-03-02 20:32:19 .@Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
4959 2018-03-02 20:32:11 Ive been at @Nissan for about three hours just for an oil change, this is ridiculous.
4960 2018-03-02 20:32:05 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.
4961 2018-03-02 20:32:03 Zechariah 4:6 This [continuous supply of oil] is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel [prince of Judah], saying, ‘Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit [of whom the oil is a symbol],’ says the Lord of hosts.
4962 2018-03-02 20:31:59 How’s hat oil change coming along? I’m tryna cop that 40
4963 2018-03-02 20:31:55 "The #UnitedStates has now overtaken Saudi Arabia in terms of total production and is gaining on #Russia as the world’s top oil producer."
4964 2018-03-02 20:31:55 Hate going to get my oil changed because no I don’t want you to check anything or replace anything.. just give me my oil change thanks!!!
4965 2018-03-02 20:31:39 Only reason I’m not shorting oil
4966 2018-03-02 20:31:25 So I’m 100% the person that orders a new side mirror for my car online to fix it myself but always goes somewhere to get my oil changed rather than do it myself
4967 2018-03-02 20:30:54 Absolutely. Our oil company is slowing operations here and focusing on the US side. Scary for us here in Saskatchewan.
4968 2018-03-02 20:30:46 Oil Ocean Zone, especially those bloody annoying seahorses :v
4969 2018-03-02 20:30:45 So we should ship by rail? We have 0 choice, we NEED oil. Modern humans can not survive without it currently. You confuse emissions with oil
4970 2018-03-02 20:30:38 OIL DIFF: 3.25 -> 3.25
4971 2018-03-02 20:30:25 I’m hungry. I’ve been in traffic. Been waiting on my oil change forever. 
4972 2018-03-02 20:30:17 ทำไมยังไม่นอนนนนนนน้องง
4973 2018-03-02 20:30:13 Folatil oil dlm jahe sudah sejak dulu tbukti bisa mngatasi problem penyumbatan hidung dan sesak nafas
4974 2018-03-02 20:30:13 I’m going to start back doing hot oil treatments, don’t like how my hair is feeling
4975 2018-03-02 20:30:08 I think there would be change. Prices for some items would go up.  But the US is blesses with many natural and human resource. Oil, gas, food production, a strong military, infrastructure and yankee know how.  I do not see us  becoming isolationist
4976 2018-03-02 20:30:05 oil...
4977 2018-03-02 20:30:02 After the @nytimes sued @interior we now have 25,000 of emails proving that the main motivations for shrinking Bear's Ears and GSE National Monuments were oil, gas and coal. Just realizing how often I was lied to while reporting this piece:
4978 2018-03-02 20:29:43 Lots of activists from US.  If you remember. Hollywood stars flying in and also driving big buses in to protest against Fort Mac.  Oil.  Disgusting.
4979 2018-03-02 20:29:41 Since Utah votes overwhelming Republican and our districts are gerrymandered, Utah politicians don't worry about getting reelected. This makes them targets for industries (coal, oil, fracking, etc.) to buy them off and basically sell/lease public lands to those industries.
4980 2018-03-02 20:29:38 when they’re all seared on both sides, set em aside for a few minutes. now, stuff some fresh rosemary into a jar or bottle or cup and cover it with good olive oil. Also, take two garlic cloves and cut them into thin slices.
4981 2018-03-02 20:29:29 Looks delicious, but why would you use cooking spray and 1 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil?
4982 2018-03-02 20:29:26 Revelation 6:6 And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.
4983 2018-03-02 20:29:18 OK so u agree we need petroleum. Should we buy from places like MId Easy with human rights issues or our much more ethical oil? #outofsight
4984 2018-03-02 20:29:14 Do you read English? That's not what she said. Californians do not want offshore oil drilling. We want clean air and water. Got it?
4985 2018-03-02 20:29:12 3/2/2018 Baker-Hughes US Rig Count Total = +3 to 981, Oil +1 to 800, Gas +2 to 181, DIR = 75, HZ = 847, Vert = 59 (#RT)
4986 2018-03-02 20:28:42 We need to be self reliant for as much as we can. Oil, Natural Gas, Steel, we never know when it would become the very survival of our Country. Not sure that tariffs will work but something has to be done with other Countries that charge tariffs on our goods.
4987 2018-03-02 20:28:29 If you lived in Philly (Upper Darby...on the outskirts of Philly), you could get your nails done, a blowout and a mocktail while getting your oil changed and the same time.
4988 2018-03-02 20:28:29 Mmm the oil just adds to all the fun 
4989 2018-03-02 20:28:28 No I turned it into a productive day and I’ve been running errands all day. First time I ever got an oil change without being 4,000 miles over 
4990 2018-03-02 20:28:24 Oil and water: How climate change is threatening our two most precious commodities
4991 2018-03-02 20:28:22 @Oil4Wales were the only company pulling fuel out of the refinery at Valero, Pembroke Dock today. We pulled together as a family during these extreme weather conditions by delivering heating oil drums where our tankers couldn't go! We are proud to serve Wales as best as we can!

4995 2018-03-02 20:27:33 おはようございます
4996 2018-03-02 20:27:21 BC people talking like renewable energy is gonna get us off petroleum products. Oil is in the tires on your car, in the soles of your sneakers, in the plastic in your kid’s toy. Agree AB shouldn’t sell out to US companies. But oil is forever

4998 2018-03-02 20:27:19 Today was FRIGGIN' SCARY!!! My car almost broke down here. Even after I got an oil change. So upset now. The damned mechanics didn't even remotely bother to look at it. Even after I drove it up there. URGH!!! 
4999 2018-03-02 20:27:09 Purchased some Renaissance Oil “A” Warrants past couple days. This is a very interesting Mexican shale pioneer with All-Star mgmt. The warrants are being offered by one seller at intrinsic value so you get the time value and the leverage for FREE at these prices  $ROE $ROE.WT.A
5000 2018-03-02 20:26:51 No they did not bleach o, is just that caro white is their annointing oil...nevermind.
5001 2018-03-02 20:26:40 get some big hearty mushrooms, like king oyster or royal trumpet or even portobellos. Cut em into quarter inch slices. put just a little bit of high heat oil in a pan, get it very hot, and sear the mushroom slices a few at a time, replenishing the oil as the shrooms soak it up.

5003 2018-03-02 20:26:30 USD is down today against world currencies. CAD is down against world currencies and USD. Weak Canadian GDP report of 1.7% annualized growth versus 2% expected. Govt that has shown a lack of support for business. Low Western Canadian Select oil prices, proposed US tariffs, etc..
5004 2018-03-02 20:26:28 You know what? This rally of pro oil and gas supporters is taking place right in the lions den. Have yet to see one protest against oil and gas in NEBC or any other "patch town".  The hard working men and women in the industry and others that support it are not afraid of doing so
5005 2018-03-02 20:26:16 I just did the oil. Then the joint for later . I wish you were here to help with the pipe lol. It still don't know how to use it
5006 2018-03-02 20:26:10 Oh dang, if you don’t mind me asking, what brand was it? I need a new beard oil
5007 2018-03-02 20:26:06 nothing more romantic than being asked out on a date by the man changing your oil at the local Jiffy Lube #woof
5008 2018-03-02 20:26:06 I feel like the cartridges don’t make me feel as good as taking oil straight up! I’ve only tried a couple though, I’ll definitely keep an eye out for that brand
5009 2018-03-02 20:26:02 That’s a shitload of snake oil !
5010 2018-03-02 20:25:57 You call it battle, I call it an easy narrative too many jump to instead of looking to see if there are other real issues & not something we are guessing is or isn't there. Again, two different viewpoints.
5011 2018-03-02 20:25:55 Mint bath bomb, spearmint essential oil being diffused, peppermint tea, peppermint lip balm and mint hair conditioner. If I can't breathe after this, there is no hope. Call my mom.

5020 2018-03-02 20:24:36 U.S hasn't been Energy Dependent for 8 years.  Obama increased our Oil reserves more than either of the last 2 Presidents combined. And increased Green Energy Jobs by about 300% He made energy reliance his staple. And did.  The only part that suffered was coal

5031 2018-03-02 20:23:00 Are any of y’all members of Thrive Market? The annual fee looks worth it just on my probiotics and olive oil alone.
5032 2018-03-02 20:22:39 Im watching @parksandrecnbc s5e10 where the guys have a group bachelor party and hang out on Lucas Oil Stadium.

5070 2018-03-02 20:19:05 @LizClaman - it’s kinda hypocritical to me that you hype price deltas caused by metal cost increases as bad while seemingly cheering oil price increases without discussing price increases as a result to EVERYTHING

5076 2018-03-02 20:18:15 With UK’s gas supply at breaking point with the cold weather, oil at a year high why not consider a Mitsubishi Electric Ecodan Air Source Heat Pump? #rhi get a government backed tax free payment and reduced running costs for that super summer holiday DM me
5077 2018-03-02 20:18:11 I just used soap and water! But cooking oil sounds like it'll get a lot more out. Thank you girl!

5083 2018-03-02 20:18:00 For once he is helping our cause. But even I don't think we'll get a trade war. This is like him talking down-then-up the dollar. It's a negotiation tactic. But short term while his ugly mouth moves, we can benefit :)

5085 2018-03-02 20:17:55 $SSOF looks like it's at launching pad.
projects two (2) potential oil rig sales that will generate estimated gross sales of $11M to $15M in the first half ...final 2017 year-end net revenue of $1.110M on gross sales of $5.957M.

5099 2018-03-02 20:15:53 Canadian's are slick, ripping off Americans and actually giving them a services surplus that erases the trade deficit. If only American's didn't need so much oil, steel, lumber and other resources, then they'd balance their goods deficit.

5110 2018-03-02 20:14:33 So let's sidestep the Saudi oil and go #renewable. That WILL reduce carbon, if we do it right. A big energy industry will spring up to replace #oilsands, and all will once again be well.
5111 2018-03-02 20:14:17 Me: I'm having so much problems w/ my research I don't know if I'm on the right track oil won't be important in 20 years they say but I don't agree.

5127 2018-03-02 20:12:41 That’s how the ethanol mandate works.  It not only makes fuel higher it makes every corn product higher (almost all grocery items).  It results in no net savings of oil/carbon and makes the US poorer while further enriching farmers.  A regressive tax.

5153 2018-03-02 20:07:17 You can add 20ml cooking oil if you want. Blend, knead 10 mins. Rest 2 mins, knead in any seeds etc, set to rise. Bake first 10 mins gas 9, turn down to gas 6 bake further 30 mins or so till cooked!

5157 2018-03-02 20:06:12 And, probably increasing production and use of plastic as an alternative to steel and aluminum, harming the environment, but helping DJT's oil baron buddies.
5158 2018-03-02 20:06:11 The "stupidest, dumbass" people would like to know how much @OrrinHatch's map influenced @SecretaryZinke's decision to open natural reserves to oil/gas drilling
5159 2018-03-02 20:06:04 Didn’t we just take over as the largest oil exporter in the world? Doesn’t China buy our coal? I mean, seriously, we are so powerful. Everyone knows it, and they have been scared that someday are stupid govt would figure it out. Thank God Trump is here! We’re back, baby.
5160 2018-03-02 20:05:52 Trumps just a trade isolationist he wants to control the price of steel the price of oil.. got to get rid of any over supply. Leading to higher prices for consumers.
5161 2018-03-02 20:05:43 Looks like YOU are the one afraid of the NRA. 
Clean that gun oil off your lips sir.
5162 2018-03-02 20:05:32 Great...water in the oil.
5163 2018-03-02 20:05:20 30%-50% of Russias govt revenues are from Oil & Gas production.

5167 2018-03-02 20:05:11 Not casual sexism, so just sexism. I feel like this discussion is going to go well. It's not that hard to be opposed to additional expansion of oil and gas development while recognizing that we still need them at the moment. Absolutism is stupid.

5174 2018-03-02 20:04:29 actually... and somewhat related... it has to do with the dollar tanking a few years ago. which if you look historically, the Canadian Dollar and Oil prices seem to be tied at the hip.
5175 2018-03-02 20:04:24 Maybe so, but it's still oil and its derivatives that are pushing the climate to crisis. If/when it tips, we are going to look very foolish trying to prop up the #fossilfuel regime.
5176 2018-03-02 20:04:20 Ay Wellie, you know that one kid that swears he's hella smart but he's a fuckin' doofus?

5182 2018-03-02 20:03:43 And in two years from now, we will all have accepted this fact and enjoy it! In about five years nobody will own a car anymore and the use of fossil fuel will reduced by 50% in 2025, which will result in a drastic change in all oil producing countries.

5212 2018-03-02 20:00:52 Dirt and infection cause acne and if only she can wash her face 3x a day with warm water and organic soap and use ori or coconut oil to apply after wash. I'm sure it will be better, whatever she's applying isn't working n it makes me sad
5213 2018-03-02 20:00:46 Blend 3 pints chick peas with 2 tablespoons cheddar. Adorn with  Olive Oil. Mix until crumbly. Serve warm.

5218 2018-03-02 20:00:23 For example, MSM hasn’t mentioned this & both your government & Russia’s is trying to downplay it, but your airforce bombed the shit out of some Russian mercenaries a few weeks back. It was in a battle for an oil refinery in the Kurdish held territory of Northern Syria
5219 2018-03-02 20:00:15 This tweet smells like patchouli oil
5220 2018-03-02 20:00:08 This FBN deal is Internet snake oil. Making mountains out of the mole hills of public genetics. Even if many companies carry some of the same hybrids doesn’t mean anything. There are way too many variables in a bag of seed including age of the seed, treatment etc.
5221 2018-03-02 20:00:05 Adobo, sazon, and Sofrito: recao (culantro), cilantro, red onion, garlic, green cubanelle pepper and blend with olive oil.

5224 2018-03-02 19:59:59 Fun fact: deodorant is cancer causing and has a bunch of bad stuff in it for you and coconut oil does a 1000x better job and is a natural antiperspirant along w good smelling and no cancer.
5225 2018-03-02 19:59:45 She also said she is taking a break from Hollywood to fix democracy... I would guess her PR people burn midnight oil to come up with this latest statement 
5226 2018-03-02 19:59:41 President TRUMP leave the gun laws alone, this is coming from the oil fields in North Dakota
5227 2018-03-02 19:59:31 EDIT: Had this the wrong way round - 

#oil as a feedstock expected to overtake #transport use as a driver of future demand. Per $bp Dale, “think plateau, not peak”
5228 2018-03-02 19:59:25 Who tryna pay for this oil change and tune up?
5229 2018-03-02 19:58:44 Free Trade is a fantasy. The only people who push Free Trade, are the minority who benefit. Professional Snake Oil Salesmen.
5230 2018-03-02 19:58:34 my god i'm so hard now.i'd love to oil them up.

5236 2018-03-02 19:57:12 The discovery of oil in our national parks does not justify their area's decrease. Interior Secretary Zinke must reverse decisions to shrink the area of parks such as Bears Ears.
5237 2018-03-02 19:57:00 I've tried edibles once and it did help, Smoking weed makes me throw up. I'm going to try CBD oil but haven't yet.

5241 2018-03-02 19:56:19 Love fennel!  It is so underutilized by most home cooks. I make a simple, refreshing salad during the summer with fennel, heirloom tomatoes and red onions and a simple balsamic and olive oil dressing.
5242 2018-03-02 19:55:49 @TJRicks_TSP lmao just watched a coworker dump oil into a pump already on amd get misted in the face

5244 2018-03-02 19:55:45 Not being dependent on middle eastern oil is more of feature than a bug 
5245 2018-03-02 19:55:39 What Elise can we do. Canada does not support Alberta and Saskatchewan.  They won’t allow the pipeline so we can sell our oil at world price instead of a 40% discount to the State.  We are losing investors and are shutting in our oil.
5246 2018-03-02 19:55:30 I use shea moisture styling creme after I shower and defuse my hair and use Castro oil so it promotes hair growth and moistures the curls. As long as I use very moisturizing products I never worry about the rain
5247 2018-03-02 19:55:21 Oh, totally! They'd blast open Half Dome in Yosemite if it had oil underneath it.
5248 2018-03-02 19:55:18 Question for those on Twitter during our break: Are there parallels between the convergence of automobiles, oil, and telephone in the last industrial revolution and renewable #energy, #blockchain and IoT emerging today? What do you think? #2018MITEC
5249 2018-03-02 19:55:08 Was the oil even hot? Even the onions didn’t do their signature sizzle 
5250 2018-03-02 19:55:06 Psalm 92:9-10 NASB
For, behold, Your enemies, O LORD, For, behold, Your enemies will perish; All who do iniquity will be scattered. [10] But You have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox; I have been anointed with fresh oil.
5251 2018-03-02 19:54:34 It’s fucking oil bro just do it where nobody sees you
5252 2018-03-02 19:54:26 Me: Ama, some part of my hair seems locked. Haven't been combing it.

Ama: By the time I bring anointing oil, it will unlock.

How in God's name do I deal with this my sister?!
5253 2018-03-02 19:54:04 Condi's all about the oil $$$. She's got a tanker named after her.
5254 2018-03-02 19:54:03 I think the silver metallic (?) stuff is an oil injector of some sort. So the box was part of tools for a hand powered generator which gave power to a radio transmitter.
5255 2018-03-02 19:53:48 Then oil yerself up and get yer sarong on for après wear...
5256 2018-03-02 19:53:35 Try oil filled radiators.
5257 2018-03-02 19:53:22 Just another snake oil salesmen, just like you.
5258 2018-03-02 19:53:08 Outside of messing with people's health insurance, expanding oil drilling one of best ways to own libs. So #MAGA.
5259 2018-03-02 19:52:59 It’s a battle that professional athletes have to deal with. Especially in rabid markets.
5260 2018-03-02 19:52:59 So you think a 900 billion dollar defiect is a good thing for American workers? You have been silent on this. When America seemed itself off middle east oil and started producing its own, American workers benefited hugely.
5261 2018-03-02 19:52:27 I agree. Canada needs to support the oil sands and allow our oil to be shipped to tidewater. It benefits all of Canada.
5262 2018-03-02 19:52:20 if anyone could point me in the direction of obtaining some CBD oil that would be cool.
5263 2018-03-02 19:52:03 Start with Flint Michigan, oil pipeline from Russia that your daddy approved had massive spill.
5264 2018-03-02 19:51:36 What’s a girl gotta do to get an oil change around here
5265 2018-03-02 19:51:30 (1/2) involving top civilian from one of the country's oil-rich states. Both cases were linked to oil proceeds. Enrico Monfrini,  a Swiss-based lawyer "the man who dictators fear the most", was used by the Nigerian govt of 1999 -2007, to help
5266 2018-03-02 19:51:30 Let me know how that goes , it’s the oil?
5267 2018-03-02 19:51:17 I have gch, but I also have a large oil filled rad and a small electric fire. Belt and braces
5268 2018-03-02 19:51:07 I would if I am allowed as an ex-indie!
5269 2018-03-02 19:50:53 Seriously, process your oil, don’t sell crude or bitumen. Processed, that’s where you’ll find more jobs and profit.
Stop selling your soul (and resources to US companies).
5270 2018-03-02 19:50:21 What other industry imports should we hit with high tariffs? Oil?
5271 2018-03-02 19:50:19 Tractor trailers and buses are blowing over. Power outages across the area

5273 2018-03-02 19:50:15 I have had an affa Friday. Put toilet roll down the toilet & spilled some of my mums oil essence! Gaff smells fine now though.
5274 2018-03-02 19:50:12 Russias govt revenues are 30% Oil & Gas.
Worst thing for Russia is more US Oil & Gas
It will cut there govt revenues suubstantially

Hillarys US Energy policy was exactly same as if Putin had written it himself.
No way Putin wanted Trump.
No way Trump is helping Russia.
5275 2018-03-02 19:50:08 His childish behavior cost a lot of US citizens 401s accounts a few saw bucks. I wonder if China will still help Alaska with a NG pipeline and LNG plants that the state is desperate for but can not develop with the current oil industry players.
5276 2018-03-02 19:49:48 Someone gave me a bottle of truffle oil, I don't care for truffle oil.
 
Sesame oil is great.
5277 2018-03-02 19:49:41 Both!  The latter because they're contributing to #pollution.  The former because it is now often used outside of its necessary purposes...hence creating a waste of resources (such as water and fossil fuels/oil) to produce disposables.
5278 2018-03-02 19:49:26 We heard good old coconut oil is good...but fear we’d just lick our paws as we love the stuff! Also heard vaseline

5283 2018-03-02 19:48:52 The text on the inside says “high pressure brush”, “lubricant oil boiler(?)”, “low pressure brush” so I think you’ve got some sort of grease nipple?, and are missing the two brushes. Maybe.
5284 2018-03-02 19:48:51 He’s a billionaire. Panama papers show he is secret owner of an oil company

5288 2018-03-02 19:47:57 KFC Gravy?  It's made with about 80% salt and high fat...they use the fat from the chicken drippings.  Time for a progressive KFC, using body friendly methods and ingredients.  Maybe something like sweet potato fries, and use healthy oil for cooking the chicken?
5289 2018-03-02 19:47:41 I had to pay and get a to-go box in the middle of dinner because the table next to me was loudly talking about how if “Shillary” had won, Texas would have seceded and the rest of the US would slowly run out of oil. -_-

5305 2018-03-02 19:45:59 It’s a bit more than that. If a new Pres doesn’t steal from his country, and invests in repairing the oil industry infrastructure, there will be plenty of lubricant to grease the economy

5309 2018-03-02 19:44:57 In fact we are also your biggest oil supplier. Trump wants to build the Keystone xl pipeline. How about we just cut off the oil too? We buy all our gas in western Canada from you. Let’s make our own refinery and not buy from you.
5310 2018-03-02 19:44:56 I just saw 7oz of 100% coconut oil at Sep*hora. It was $38. I hope the people who buy it learn to love themselves one day.

5338 2018-03-02 19:41:00 So why do pastors still anoint us with Goya Oil
5339 2018-03-02 19:40:58 Is it costing canadians that much or is that the difference that the oil companies which own and sell the oil are losing?
5340 2018-03-02 19:40:53 After two years, now you saying cant mix water and oil? What a joke. Then how it is nagtagal pa ito? Kung matagal na pala, paano nangyari ang two years?

5347 2018-03-02 19:40:02 Hmm, I see. Interesting.
Seems like the bigger problem would be adding oil after you strain it, right? I prefer to use butter for that, but I guess ideally you immediately combine it with sauce

5360 2018-03-02 19:38:29 I believe the Atlantic is behind what is called a "pay-wall". Basically it is where a user must pay a sum of money in order to view the article. Hope this clears it up for you and let me know if you have any questions! :)
5361 2018-03-02 19:38:23 A little bit more research (asking a friend) and it might be nothing to do with ink at all but is actually for lubricating oil and cleaning machinery.
5362 2018-03-02 19:38:17 Someone else tweeted yesterday that they were low on heating oil. Never have I been so pleased to have central heating x
5363 2018-03-02 19:38:13 Yep kin freezing.  Just using last of oil to heat water .. Sat under a blanket like a bloody old man.  Hopefully Merlot will help .
5364 2018-03-02 19:38:09 My dry oil is a citrus scent as was the stuff I used to put on my hair when I had dreads. I'm usually a fruity scent kinda guy. But I have an aftershave that is literally just rum scented. Splash a half a shot of captain on my neck lol
5365 2018-03-02 19:38:06 2nd amend. To protect ourselves from tyrannical gov. Maybe  that's why there is 2Anend. This shooting is not what you think ck out Hoog family.

5366 2018-03-02 19:38:04 Did you know... 

licenses have created new generation oil moguls such as Modupe Alakija and Folorunso Alakija  of FAMFA Oil Ltd?
She is currently worth 1.7 billion dollars and was once the world's richest woman.

5370 2018-03-02 19:37:37 Some folks use it so the noodles don’t stick together. The problem with oil is that it makes it far more difficult for the pasta to adhere to the sauce.
5371 2018-03-02 19:37:31 I already have one in oil slick

5374 2018-03-02 19:37:06 Was cooking shirtless yesterday... got some oil splatter burns on my stomach -.- @RAREGEMSNTHINGS
5375 2018-03-02 19:37:05 I didn't put down enough oil so my friend rice is more hot eggy rice + wok with a thin layer of rice burnt onto it...
5376 2018-03-02 19:36:47 Well @Delta better stock up with soy milk, vegan food, biodegradable seat cushions and train all their staff the 300 different genders because the few Libs that can afford to fly will be their top customers. Hopefully they’re working on a plane thats fueled by vegetable oil.
5377 2018-03-02 19:36:40 Took 3 hours to get my oil changed  I'll just wash and clean up & tomorrow have my girl morning

5380 2018-03-02 19:36:06 Unpucker ya, it’s a word. That’s what happens when you get a chance to scale in these little oil names
5381 2018-03-02 19:36:04 today’s mood:  curled up in bed with 3 blankets, diffusing lavender oil, and listening to nitw ost
5382 2018-03-02 19:35:42 what happened? That fish oil addict blocked me for now reason!
5383 2018-03-02 19:35:15 I come to get an oil change and find out all this other shit wrong with my car yakjhimdonewithlifeajhskk
5384 2018-03-02 19:35:10 PSA: don’t paint your kitchen cabinets wit wall paint or anything oil base
5385 2018-03-02 19:35:07 A good condition, oil and flat iron got my leave out looking like I perm it
5386 2018-03-02 19:34:58 Oh, and speaking of pasta... using oil in the pasta water is utterly anathema
5387 2018-03-02 19:34:42 Last last I don put on my transistor Radio to listen to BBC Hausa,how man go do
5388 2018-03-02 19:34:38 ON has had 16 years of Liberals chasing companies/investment out of ON.... @jkenney will get investment back in AB oil...
5389 2018-03-02 19:34:32 I guess I have been schooled. I am far from left but today I am not right wing either. Doesn't it have to be turned into oil from the bitumen? I watched thousands of trucks with the tar sand in them. That's not tar its oil? The definition can go by oil or tar or bituminous sand.
5390 2018-03-02 19:34:28 It's actually quite straight forward.  Starting from 2000's to up until now between 1 trillion to trillion and a half dollars disappeared in the offshores from oil, gas and other commodities sales... Do you think that they would make a nuclear dust from their life work?
5391 2018-03-02 19:34:13  what did BHO say - to forget about manufacturing jobs they are never coming back? Guess what? BHO they are coming back...Also BHO made the USA depended on M.E. for oil. Guess what? BHO the USA will be the No. 1 exporter of oil and gas soon...TRUMP is MAGA everyday
5392 2018-03-02 19:34:11 They told me the first thing I needed to do was cleanse, outwardly and inwardly. They washed my sheets, flipped my mattress, washed my hair ,coated my head with olive oil, and drew me a bath with bleach, baking soda, and epson salt scolding hot. They prayed over me while I soaked
5393 2018-03-02 19:33:56 Has anyone ever used coconut oil on their hair? I want to try but worried it will make my hair greasy  help! #coconutoil
5394 2018-03-02 19:33:54 Quick tip: Baby Oil
5395 2018-03-02 19:33:52 The fallacy is that this is for national security. If so, the wiser course is for the US to buy and stockpile US made metals. We do it for oil reserves.
5396 2018-03-02 19:33:44 I’m about to have the best sleep of my life right now. Heater on, freshly showered, bath and body works sleep Aromatherapy oil and the sound of the rain outside.  night y’all
5397 2018-03-02 19:33:37 One thing that will always be valuable in the apartment and the ground use it for long-term investment value problem/opportunity. Oil cos r mostly doing it anyway; all that’s needed is a govt guarantee, higher % in long term future. Great for retirement / education funds
5398 2018-03-02 19:33:26 The way Russia still for the oil pipeline by India, don't you remember the executive order that has your signature on it mr. 45?
5399 2018-03-02 19:33:19 This lot is softwood underneath, but has had years of oil, varnish & wax, so I played safe with BIN.
5400 2018-03-02 19:33:15 i’m for sure gonna have to try that! i’ve heard good things about tea tree oil.
5401 2018-03-02 19:33:14 How about some Mom’s Robot Oil?
5402 2018-03-02 19:33:14 Excellent I love it.  Cancel NAFTA we can get a better deal selling our oil to China.   Canada wants fair trade too!
5403 2018-03-02 19:33:01 After having my oil change light on since September, I FINALLY did it
5404 2018-03-02 19:32:47 Brian jacks dips and squat thrusts! Jodie Sheckter using oil to slide.
5405 2018-03-02 19:32:45 That ermine-gland oil in the elevator.
5406 2018-03-02 19:32:44 There’s a literal fucking cowboy in this jiffy lube and I’m scared he’ll pull an old west pistol out of his ten gallon hat if I take a picture. is he getting the oil changed on his horse
5407 2018-03-02 19:32:41 From what I've seen its the value of the oil fields to Putin et al
5408 2018-03-02 19:32:30 Had to put some oil in my car. Got rid of that check engine light.
5409 2018-03-02 19:32:24 Agree; in the 30'-40's "we" sold scrap metals to Japan, who re-refined it & used a large part of it to turn into the equipment used at Pearl Harbor. And "WE" sold them oil for the fuel too. When "we" stopped selling them the products, they claimed "we" broke the trade agreement
5410 2018-03-02 19:32:15 I thought you meant motor oil because you were trying to become a human car
5411 2018-03-02 19:32:13 oil. 02.03.2018
5412 2018-03-02 19:32:05 You will find a TV interview of Admiral Richard Byrd where he tells of a piece of land on the South Pole the size of America not covered in snow and ice but green land, he talks of coal, oil, minerals I believe etc. With talk of over population and lack of resources why hide this
5413 2018-03-02 19:31:59 Now those investors are gone because Alberta can’t get their oil out.
5414 2018-03-02 19:31:58 Guess how much water is tainted by the "clean" coal/oil industry that your father props up? Guess how much damage Trump's withdrawal from Paris Climate agreement will do? Wanna help this country? Get your father to resign.
5415 2018-03-02 19:31:54 “Yeah we get a warnin signal saying our oil was low, we checked and it’s low...so what should our next step be?”
5416 2018-03-02 19:31:49 I understand exactly where you are coming from but imo it's unfair and somewhat insulting to the players. It's just two different ways of looking at it.
5417 2018-03-02 19:31:34 Got sick this morning before I was supposed to leave for Dallas. Not sick anymore, getting my oil changed and hitting the road! I hope all of yall have a fantastic weekend.
5418 2018-03-02 19:31:29 i hate coming to get my oil changed...i just want my oil changed that’s it!
5419 2018-03-02 19:31:27 Again back to nature. God is not only loving but just per the scripture. God is Holy and sin cannot reside with him. I like the oil and water analogy.
5420 2018-03-02 19:31:20 I genuinely think for my next launch I'm just going to hire a kitchen and cook for people. Bread, oil and balsamic to start, then a massive vat of bean chilli and homemade tortilla. I dunno about pudding yet. But yes, I will. Marry you.
5421 2018-03-02 19:31:05 White people use coconut oil for everything smh
5422 2018-03-02 19:31:00 Oil companies know, they just have to grasp the nettle.
5423 2018-03-02 19:30:56 2nd try to 61.40 was a rejection too. The bears have it in control this time around.:) close 61.24
5424 2018-03-02 19:30:46 Whip together 1/3 cup chicken with 1/3 cup Danish pastry. Mix into  Olive Oil. Cut with butter. Serve
5425 2018-03-02 19:30:45 I cannot confirm nor deny having just had a moderate freak out at a conference about the future of the oil sands and the oil market in general.
5426 2018-03-02 19:30:44 Use oil on the damp skin if you need extra layer. Because I have combination & I could only use it in winters.
5427 2018-03-02 19:30:42 I just witnessed my roommate rubbing coconut oil onto her face....
5428 2018-03-02 19:30:32 Looks like Big Oil and the Nuclear Lobby are very interested in stopping #renewables and is using these cheap puppets for their disinformation as smear campaign. For the price they can only rent Billy Graham worshippers. SAD

5431 2018-03-02 19:30:24 The letcho was 2 types of squash, 5 types of pepper, 3 types of sausage, 2 types of onions, 2 types of paprika, tomatoes, garlic, brown sugar, chili powder, salt, pepper, and sesame oil. YUM!
5432 2018-03-02 19:30:19 好き！
5433 2018-03-02 19:29:50 Which version or era? Also the dollar is infinite, where as oil is not.
5434 2018-03-02 19:29:48 Tar sands is a negativistic word used by the left to slag the oil sands. DEFINITION of 'Oil Sands'
Sand and rock material which contains crude bitumen (a heavy, viscous form of crude oil). Oil sands are found primarily in the Athabasca region of northern Alberta, Canada.
5435 2018-03-02 19:29:32 @cathynewman Excellent interview with Michael Gove. I don't think he has been so uncomfortable for quite some time. He really is a snake oil salesman. Great job 
5436 2018-03-02 19:29:27 Oh Ivanka, 
imagine how many oil spills, pollution and such we will have since your daddy/boss is relaxing EPA rules.
5437 2018-03-02 19:29:26 As for oils, I loved the Vitamin E oil from TBS but not the oils of life one as much. It tends to break me out if I use it with a moisturizer but my skin is dry so I do always need an extra layer.
5438 2018-03-02 19:29:00 Guys I just applied for my first credit card and bought new tires and im going to get my oil changed allllll by my self. Little adulting victory 
5439 2018-03-02 19:28:56 Yes cuddly cats. Perfect. 
On a serious note though Sal, a portable oil filled heater would warm things up a bit for you in your upstairs rooms should you need to. Just a thought. xx
5440 2018-03-02 19:28:53 Ya boy had to put some anointing oil on these 35 dollar used tires  the wild serious
5441 2018-03-02 19:28:33 I am all for natural scents my beard oil is cedar wood and the balm I use is also some form of wood oil and grape seed oil flax ect
5442 2018-03-02 19:28:32 Well done oil for Wales for fixing our boiler thank you 
5443 2018-03-02 19:28:30 Wth is body oil?
5444 2018-03-02 19:28:20 Carpet bagger Caforio will lose AGAIN. Did he ever buy a house here? lmfao... Does he still defend Oil and gas companies?

5447 2018-03-02 19:27:54 @Chick021 happy birthday Andy aka oil, hope your really boozy  xxx
5448 2018-03-02 19:27:50 everytime i come get an oil change dude gives me $25 off 
5449 2018-03-02 19:27:39 Idk whether to put coconut oil on my hair or Dabur Amla ?!
5450 2018-03-02 19:27:26 “They’re not going to drill, they said oil wasn’t a factor” 
5451 2018-03-02 19:27:25  , any thoughts on Puerto Rico having to ration water soon?? What about their infrastructure ? They are American citizens just like you and myself.  What about the #Fracking from HUGE companies contaminating our drinking water, or the pipeline oil spills? 
5452 2018-03-02 19:27:09 Tea tree oil and honey! It dries them up fast!
5453 2018-03-02 19:27:07 This gives me a chance to rant about new cars. I hate how a lot of them don't have dipsticks anymore. If the computer has a bug and thinks you have oil when you don't then your engine dies. At least with a dipstick we could be 100% certain how much oil we had.
5454 2018-03-02 19:27:07 Man U '99 were not even all that. Ok they had a good run and they had *a lot* of players on *top* form. Arsenal '02 was just as good. Point is, City are good so whatever you think about Oil ££ show respect to their football.
5455 2018-03-02 19:27:03 Yeah girllllll sometimes I'll put half coconut oil and half raspberry preserve and I'll fold it together 
5456 2018-03-02 19:26:48 Until it comes with smoke screens, tire shredders, oil slicks and Odd Job, I'll wait it out until the v2.0 version, thanks.
5457 2018-03-02 19:26:42 Now the are, in the begining it was all US money invested. Companies from developed world are evacuating and selling to 3rd world, due to anti oil policies in Canada.
5458 2018-03-02 19:26:35 Scripture of the Day! 

Psalm 23:5

You prepare a table b4 me
In the presence of my ENEMIES;
You anoint my head with oil;
MY CUPS RUNS OVER
5459 2018-03-02 19:26:31 I was late to work and then I forgot I had to get my oil changed and the place is taking so long to ring me up I’ve been gone for like 15 minutes ..do I go in the bathroom and cry now or later ?¿
5460 2018-03-02 19:26:27 Use enamels or thinned oil paints - once they have dried for around half an hour you can gently rub away excess paint and overspill with a cotton bud (they take a long time to become permanent).
5461 2018-03-02 19:26:20 I feel like hitting this guy shouting bottle water in this frustrating hold up...
5462 2018-03-02 19:26:14 I did not mention oil.  Even KRG’s energy policy not always about profits. Politics plays an important role. Why Russia gave gas to Ukraine below market price in the past?  Cost and benefit analysis?
5463 2018-03-02 19:25:59 You do realize even Harley Davidson condemned that tariff, stating that in fact, competition from Japan was making them realize they were offering an inferior product, and made HD go to Japan and learn from their models and integrate them into their bikes.... Oil leak 80's bikes.
5464 2018-03-02 19:25:55 story abt how i deserve a salty spatoon day pass: i got 1 hr sleep, lasted thru a three hr oil paint class, trudged back to dorms in the sleet, rain and wind, k.o for 1.45 hr, woke back up WAS ABT TO NOT GO TO MY NEXT CLASS BC OF THE RAIN but i felt guilty and left my dorm
5465 2018-03-02 19:25:53 So was due an oil delivery today .. But due to snow drift at the end of my road no can do ... so low on oil now .. Bugger . Ordered it over 2 weeks ago .. Bastards .
5466 2018-03-02 19:25:49 Trying to get back into the swing of things after too long without a paintbrush in my hand.... 
'Naughty Naughty Kiefer', Oil on panel.
5467 2018-03-02 19:25:04 I've used the oil from that range as well as the moisturing cream. If you want to opt for facial oil, I'd say try Maliha's new oil line Whimsy. The one I use is amazing. If you are not into oils, than get the moisturising cream from Oils of Life
5468 2018-03-02 19:25:01 the first concession given in Nigeria dates as far back as 1900s. It was given to D'Arcy Exploration Company and Whitehall Petroleum. However, neither company found oil of commercial value and they returned their licenses in 1923

#FunFactFriday
5469 2018-03-02 19:24:31 Broskie, this question you're asking. Just make a lil enquiry around the Lagos space, for example. DPR peeps running oil inspection outfits and other conflict-of-interest matter them.
5470 2018-03-02 19:24:13 Just watched this on your rec. What a great film. *Almost* ah, EVERY SCENE, could’a been a’ OIL’a PAINTING! Love it. Full film on YouTube an absolute treat! Cheers!
5471 2018-03-02 19:24:05 "you built like an olive oil Dutchmaster" - @PaytonBackwoods
5472 2018-03-02 19:23:59 Hahaha! Wow, yeah, America "never weighs in on other countries' politics" - you just get the CIA to organize coups, and install "friendly" (puppet) governments, or simply BARGE IN, and steal their fucking oil! Do you know ANY history AT ALL??????
5473 2018-03-02 19:23:48 This must be that "white privilege" I hear so much about.
5474 2018-03-02 19:23:38 Actually we are modelling for an oil painting, none of this selfie nonsense, that is actually just a particularly nasty Sontaran ploy.
5475 2018-03-02 19:23:32 It didn’t do jack shit for me. I just ordered sunflower oil from @BahiCosmetics to try
5476 2018-03-02 19:23:25 And oil production, yes! Non-oil is increasing but it's less than 10% of total exports; insignificant.
5477 2018-03-02 19:23:24 The only think anyone should be buying from Guy is Olive oil.
5478 2018-03-02 19:23:20 I second Rabeeyah. Would definitely recommend the Tea Tree Oil. It's potent and quite effective. I'd say you should get L'Oréal's charcoal mask rather than the TBS one. Will save you some bucks. Vitamin E range is nice. Haven't personally tried Vitamin C.

5481 2018-03-02 19:22:53 Fcuk! Now England will have to protect us from that worthless oil for another 20 years or so before they discard us to our Independent Fate...... oh woe is us, thank the Lord, Unionism and England for saving us from skintness!

Aye right 
5482 2018-03-02 19:22:49 im at walmart waiting for my sister’s oil change to be done and i’m just sitting in the middle of an isle someone rescue me
5483 2018-03-02 19:22:39 sooooo i forgot to get my oil changed like a month ago and my car decided to shut off on me IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD. whatta great day
5484 2018-03-02 19:22:38 Is it true that you guys have oil version of nice perfumes there without tje alcohol?
5485 2018-03-02 19:22:36 So the last 3 trains I’ve seen along #Sask Hwy 16 the #CN trains were pulling all oil tankers, the last 2 #CP trains at Chauvin crossing on #Sask 17 were tankers as well. No grain.
5486 2018-03-02 19:22:35 Congratulations to our February Clean Up Draw winners!  Ron Weicker won the Roadside Assistance kit, and Brian Bambenek won an oil change.
5487 2018-03-02 19:22:30 Too busy building oil pipelines to worry about water lines. Otherwise #Flint would have #CleanWater
5488 2018-03-02 19:22:30 Canada has one of world's best practices in dealing with oil extraction. Leftists would rather destroy oil industry here and depend on the blood and unregulated methods of middle eastern countries, & fleets of unregulated tankers crossing ocean. HOW does this help environment?

2014: Oil prices plummeted; Maduro rigged the economy by exploiting the official exchange rate of bolivars to USD
Dec. 2015: Maduro forced out several Supreme Court justices & filled the positions w/ loyal friends
5492 2018-03-02 19:22:08 My guess? Harvey knows there is oil in the land under Charles street. So he's planning on drilling there. But he causes a Earthquake because he doesn't drill in a stable place. #GH
5493 2018-03-02 19:22:07 By leaning in on specialization and pushing innovation—two things trump has railed against with his policies. We need a strong education system or we won’t keep a high standard of living. (That means oil, coal and steel are not products in which we base our economic livelihood.)
5494 2018-03-02 19:22:05 Maybe it’s what he hopes Earth will look like after all or most of the ice melts? Most of Florida would be under water though. But since they’re promoting oil, maybe they share the same bias as the coal and oil people we have here? I think he wants to melt the ice for his ships.

5497 2018-03-02 19:21:32 it is important to note that by virtue of the 1999 constitution, all mineral resources in Nigeria is vested in the federal government. Thus nobody can own an oil well but can only be granted concession to explore  with a certain percentage cut going to the government. #FFF

The NWO has an agenda, they orchestrated the whole thing, to steal Oil and destabilise the region.

Part of the plan was to begin the migrant crisis.

That doesn’t mean that things happening now, not years ago shouldn’t be addressed.

5628 2018-03-02 19:05:44 You do realize that these countries are going to bite back. You want equal trade with Canada then you can have it. We won't sell our oil, natural gas, electricity, water or lumber to you. You really want to destroy America don't you?

5630 2018-03-02 19:05:12 Hippocrites!  Quebec politicians don't mind raw sewage in their environment, but the "poster boy for separation", Denis Codierre, didn't want pipelines going through Quebec!  He'd rather buy oil from the Arabs!
5631 2018-03-02 19:05:08 You defeated no one but yourselves.  poorest country in the middle east in spite of oil and natural gas reserves now go milk the sigheh woman who produced you

5647 2018-03-02 19:02:59 In winter, the skin produces less oil. Many skin types need to add oil back to the skin to maintain its balance. In the summer, there is more humidity in the air. Dryness is less of a concern, but breakouts may increase #skincare

5657 2018-03-02 19:01:51 I'm pretty sure she's on loan from the red roo menace aka rupert who bought up oil rights off Syria's coast from bobo NyukNyukU.
5658 2018-03-02 19:01:39 These pols sell out so cheap! Dumping all those chemicals into the water supply and making local gov up the cost to filter out some. They used to use salt water in Texas to re-frac wells with idea that the oil will float on top  come out first
5659 2018-03-02 19:01:34 Rose water works great even though its not an oil
5660 2018-03-02 19:01:24 Fact. You don’t get enough of the oil profits. You allow multi national companies to run away with most of it.

You people hv time,
Put it in the frying oil and leave it to fry for 30mins and you don't even have to stir and stress
5666 2018-03-02 19:00:52 My point is that it can be a problem, especially during bad seasons. But that magnifying glass goes away when you’re winning.

5678 2018-03-02 18:59:37 We did with oil. If we reduced the regulations to manufacture it like we did in drilling for oil, AND give tax incentives to increase R&D to make it cheaper, AND reign in the out of control unions running (ruining) the industries, we can do it without tariffs.

5700 2018-03-02 18:57:45 There's enough oil in there to fry believe me. It will take longer than 20 mins though.
5701 2018-03-02 18:57:42 Also you save nothing at all with these vehicles. All the savings with no fossil fuels and no oil changes is lost at the end of the battery cell life. The cost of the battery and labor to change it exceeds any savings earned.
5702 2018-03-02 18:57:35 So I’m at the mechanic getting the oil changed in my car. Some dude walks in and says to the manager “Hey can I talk to you when you have a second?” Manager says yeah man what’s up? And the dude is like “...uh like in private?” I’m the only other person in the room.
5703 2018-03-02 18:57:31 I'm feeling too overwhelmed to even just go get my damn oil changed.

5716 2018-03-02 18:56:26 Yes, our ignorance.  They are adapting what our ppl were doing: yoga, veg meals, organic farming, celebrating rivers & forests etc. Now our coconut oil is fast appearing in all stores since they found it gives lot of benefits.

5729 2018-03-02 18:55:04 Quick calculation here for anyone that wants to work it out. 11.7 billion barrels of Oil at say $50 being economically fair over a long period. Now on Radio Scotlandshire today they reported FROM an expert it costs just over  $15 to extract the oil from the North Sea. Work it out
5730 2018-03-02 18:54:59 It is all a scam that would have lead to CARBON TAX. Does any think slapping ten dollars onto every barrel of oil in the US would have money used to "save the environment"? No, it would enrich the globalists; the Politboro elites.

5743 2018-03-02 18:53:59 Saying the drop in revenues is entirely related to not having a new arena is a reach. Attendance has been dropping in recent years which is mainly due to the downturn in the oil patch. The tickets Corporate Calgary purchases has dropped significantly, especially high end ones.

5755 2018-03-02 18:52:38 And that's sad since all are noble and worthy causes...but no one is going to convince Congress to just change it all in one fell swoop. It would be like tossing a nitrogen-cooled cabbage into a pot of boiling oil and expecting egg rolls to come out.

5767 2018-03-02 18:51:05 Keep in mind before his death (coincidentally 2 years ago today) Aubrey McClendon had just been indicted for allegedly trying to rig oil prices. What OPEC is doing is illegal in the US
5768 2018-03-02 18:50:47 They have a $20 mail in rebate if you get an oil change until the end of March I think!
5769 2018-03-02 18:50:47 If you're not ashamed and angry that Nigeria; Africa's largest producer of oil is the largest importer of petrol in the world, know it that you are part of the problem.
5770 2018-03-02 18:50:45 So Trump wants a trade war Will the PM  (Corporate Government) should say OK Trump but NO WAR we will not trade anything with the US (LOOK at the money they make off us by selling back to us) YES off OUR Wood, Steel, Milk, Meat, Oil, and on and on P.M Bring back our products and

5773 2018-03-02 18:50:23 So say if countries stop buying our oil will Russian oil fill the void?
5774 2018-03-02 18:49:53 Yea makes me nervous putting anything other than kerosene in to be honest, but the problem is finding somewhere locally that sells heating oil!
5775 2018-03-02 18:49:51 I wasn’t shocked. I expected oil or minerals to be a major factor, perhaps the only factor. #CorporateWelfare
5776 2018-03-02 18:49:49 Charlie lives in Shenzhen eating Chinese street food cooked gutter oil I hear! That could impact one’s perspective with various contaminates therein I suspect so go easy on him!
5777 2018-03-02 18:49:37 The reason for underperformance is that Shale produces little crude oil, but mostly condensate, which must be sold at steep discount.

5789 2018-03-02 18:47:58 Yup!! Looks like the oil has separated from the actual product
5790 2018-03-02 18:47:54 No more oil?
5791 2018-03-02 18:47:53 And now Pruitt, Zinke and 45 will have found oil where no man has ever been and these penguins are a statistic
5792 2018-03-02 18:47:45 In comparison to running out of heating oil a week ago, you’re amateur frankly.
5793 2018-03-02 18:47:42 If you're watching the power of this #noreaster, you have to understand why offshore drilling in the North East is a bad idea.

5794 2018-03-02 18:47:41 Shale does not produce much of crude oil, most is condensate, which must be sold at a steep discount. This is why Shale companies have horrible finances despite high production.
5795 2018-03-02 18:47:37 Of course it was oil
5796 2018-03-02 18:47:28 Lady in front of me at Subway: yes, I want Mayo, Honey mustard, Italian,Oil and vinegar with Extra vinegar...and ranch.  #toomuchsauce
5797 2018-03-02 18:47:26 Flooded the magic oil well
5798 2018-03-02 18:47:25 I think we’re all in agreement there
5799 2018-03-02 18:47:17 That clown wouldn’t dare challenge the science involved in the oil industry, and yes evolution is part of it
5800 2018-03-02 18:47:16 I need an eye exam, my teeth cleaned, a haircut, my tires rotated, getting close to another oil change. I’m pooped!
5801 2018-03-02 18:47:13 What's really pathetic is that up until the last half dozen games or so, a big part of Oil problem was early weak goals sapping them.  Now they can't stay ahead.  Coaching or flaws of lineup?
5802 2018-03-02 18:47:12 Well let us go then. Opps... but you do not get the oil, the gas, the whisky, the gin, the fisheries, the quality beef and lamb, the soft fruits, the barley etc
5803 2018-03-02 18:47:09 Silly boy,  When you have Oil,  you don't need no stinking tourists.............   Look how well Wyoming does!   Much better to have meth driven oil field hands that familys of stinking tourists.
5804 2018-03-02 18:47:04 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
5805 2018-03-02 18:47:03 My US history period (before we left) consisted of debates about cannabis oil stock and my teacher’s son possibly buying something from the MLB and charging 115$ on his gift card. And for some reason the wifi was still working while the power was out.
5806 2018-03-02 18:47:00 @cindymccain Patti in MT again. Cannabis oil has thousands of studies on use in brain cancer-positive results. I use 4 brain condit, it helps so much. There are types that do not cause u 2 feel high. For nausea. For pain. I hope u R open minded enuf 2 check it
5807 2018-03-02 18:46:58 Haha the countdown is already in my draft tweets until the day before the wedding. Old school, new school....not a lot of options for anything with #3 tho lol
5808 2018-03-02 18:46:57 If you think we’re the ones loaded up with oil you have some research to do on the Middle East
5809 2018-03-02 18:46:56 I love mayo but I rock with deli mustard, oil, and vinegar
5810 2018-03-02 18:46:55 This girl said she ain’t get her oil changed since June 
5811 2018-03-02 18:46:51 "Oops, time to refill the oil." (Flame Man, MM&B CD Data)
5812 2018-03-02 18:46:51 everyone is always like "oh, my parents paid my rent and spend $82 on workouts this week! $13 juice!"

mine would be like, "i was a week late with coned b/c i'm flaky, and i ordered thai again and also got a bottle of whiskey, also i paid $22 for good olive oil bc i'm an asshole"

5816 2018-03-02 18:46:03 Diesel works but could totally invalidate your boiler guarantee / better to get 20 liter fuel can and go and get heating oil
5817 2018-03-02 18:45:56 @AtlasCopcoEA confirms sponsorship for #afmass2018 Kenya edition. Excellent way to promote food safety in use of oil free compressors in Africa’s food, beverage and milling industry
5818 2018-03-02 18:45:52 Thus they were saying that it was a terrorist sponsored state because it was buying oil from Iran and the money was being used to supply wepons to other countries in the region.
5819 2018-03-02 18:45:48 Only want our oil always have done they tell so many lies.
5820 2018-03-02 18:45:44 Agree. Already thinking of stocking up on motor oil and oil filters for my Alfa.
5821 2018-03-02 18:45:43 You mist realise. During the West's give us oil & we'll give you food & medicine programme plus 2 invasions, then dismantling of all military, police, institutions, law etc by US, ANYONE that could flee Iraq did so.
5822 2018-03-02 18:45:40 What is CBD oil ? Feeling out of the loop here ...
5823 2018-03-02 18:45:35 I thought water cooler,but petrol bowsers and oil cans are more exciting to my pathetic child mind. Had a fabulous garage and toy pumps as a kid..

5827 2018-03-02 18:44:57 Oh well, should have won your referendum eh? Mind you, if you had won,  you'd be up the creek now without anyone else to blame. The low oil price since would have squeezed Mrs Crankies promises dry!

5864 2018-03-02 18:40:06 It’d be interesting to know if Hatch is invested in any of these oil and/or mining companies. Uranium perhaps??  Since Senators don’t have to adhere to insider trading rules, it’d be a real windfall for him!!  Maybe he’s cashing out and retiring?
5865 2018-03-02 18:39:49 I believed that the United States was a country where people triumphed based on how good a professional they were. If you promote someone because of their skin colour, is not that racism?

5868 2018-03-02 18:39:45 Hi Morgan! If you want to set your foundation to help control oil, we recommend you setting with Peach Perfect Matte Setting Powder. The Peach Blur is amazing on top of the setting powder to give you an airbrushed finish

5870 2018-03-02 18:39:40 Head over a Bowl of hot water with some Vicks or tea tree essential oil. Would be far better than antibiotics. Will help breathing, loosen phlegm and tea tree has antibiotic and antiviral properties.

5874 2018-03-02 18:39:33 actually with white pizza I associate alfredo sauce or olive oil as the base each of those would pair well with the nutty flavors of a brown ale or biscuity-amber.
5875 2018-03-02 18:39:31 Lol most countries? Name them. Or better yet name the ones that aren't using oil. You're so indoctrinated it's sad
5876 2018-03-02 18:39:23 Dont Do It Mate! If you have a plastic tank just lift one end and prop it to make the oil run towards the valve end
5877 2018-03-02 18:38:52 I have to say, it is beautiful out here. Like, really beautiful.

5885 2018-03-02 18:36:49 Royal Navy can get 50 barges put red cross like tents on them & begin the deportation process.   Dump off in Libya; use the oil to fund Libyan rebuilding projects. I would also argue that Soros NGO assets be frozen and used to fund ops and pay back countries targeted.

5904 2018-03-02 18:34:46 Thank you so much for sharing, @bmdadream! We are confident that you will find you love this oil as much as we do!
5905 2018-03-02 18:34:35 .@BP_plc Dale on oil demand: demand plateauing and finally starting to decline in 2035-2040 period in the Outlook's evolving transition scenario, where non-combusted sector e.g. petrochemical will replace transport as the largest demand by 2040 #BakerEnergy – bij Baker Institute for Public Policy
5906 2018-03-02 18:34:22 @tvcnewsng Lol! @FadesolaSotinwa You seemed to have been reading my mind in  the last 30mins. Lets look at the oil off the Bight of Benin, the past military govts gave it to their "friends"
5907 2018-03-02 18:34:14 Thank you so much for sharing, @bmdadream! We are confident that you will find you love this oil as much as we do!
5908 2018-03-02 18:34:07 Of Course We Do! I Live In N.C. We Also Want A Strong Economy, Strong Military, Safer Country, Higher Wages, Growing 401Ks, Protect Our 2nd. Amendment, Lower Energy Costs, No More Depending On Foreign Oil>YEAH! THAT MAY BE THE REASON NORTH CAROLINA HELP CARRY TRUMP TO VICTORY!
5909 2018-03-02 18:34:06 Lol. Look up how much oil we produce and how much oil we consume.

Not even close to energy independent.
5910 2018-03-02 18:34:01 somebody at work asked me why mike sobel was wearing that, took a total guess that its oil kings don cherry night, guess i was right!
5911 2018-03-02 18:33:58 @GlamLifeGuru @HaloBeauty so I have extremely sensitive skin... do these vitamins have oil in them? I took a beauty vitamin last summer and couldn’t figure out why my skin was breaking out into little oil pimples on my chest and neck.. it was because they had oil in them 
5912 2018-03-02 18:33:48 Did you dopes at Weekly Standard forget that YOU were the guys calling for protective tariffs on oil imports last year?  I guess free trade is good for all things (unless the billionaire who owns your magazine also owns a couple of wells.) #hypocrisy
5913 2018-03-02 18:33:46 Standard Oil case was tried by Supreme Court who broke up Rockefeller’s monopoly (trust-busting). Perhaps NRA should be tried by the Court for impinging/penalizing the rights of Delta Airlies & others for cutting ties w/them. NRA & the Georgia governor are flatout WRONG!
5914 2018-03-02 18:33:41 This should be brought before the Supreme Court — it is certainly abuse of power; similar to John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil that was the largest oil refinery during it’s time. Rockefeller used aggressive pricing to destroy competitors; a form of monopoly to threaten others.
5915 2018-03-02 18:33:40 You forgot to add the Holy water part and Anointing oil....

5919 2018-03-02 18:33:36 I'm not saying scientists are perfect, but I can't justify valuable and limited tax dollars going to unproven treatments that are often just psychosomatic or unfortunately snake oil. If your homeopathy works, science not pseudoscience will back it.

5921 2018-03-02 18:33:13 Find a commercial substitute for oil and maybe you have a case.  The middle east is not our friend and we need to be self-sustaining.
5922 2018-03-02 18:33:06 Stop reading the Daily Mail and listening to the BBC. Even without oil that Westminster has been telling us would run out in the 1980s we are still richer than many small independent countries. Ask why Scotlands books have not been published since the 1920s? Google figures before
5923 2018-03-02 18:32:56 Shout out to the poison control lady who walked me through getting super glue out of my eye yesterday. My eye is fine. I can see, and the source of irritation is gone. My face, however, and the worst reaction imaginable to the mineral oil used to dissolve the glue.

5925 2018-03-02 18:32:18 I live downtown and have a love/hate relationship with it.  Love that it's so close to everything.  Hate that there are a gazillion oil&gas bro-dude bars popping up as it becomes more residential.
5926 2018-03-02 18:32:15 ..Or : you are wrong, big time.
It seems that you are a great friend of the oil companies that want car drivers keep refilling at gaz stations, keep having H2 "refineries" and keep the distrib chain $.
Future in in BATTERIES.
Refilling will be everywhere, where electricity is.
5927 2018-03-02 18:32:13 I’m learning that the true measure of being a grown-up is remembering to change your car oil on a regular basis 
5928 2018-03-02 18:32:11 This is your problem... Definitions. Quackery is #innovation (in selling snake oil) and most #innovation (in doing things) is quackery. For example people in the machine learning business have been selling weighted linear regression under different names for ages

5931 2018-03-02 18:31:33 That would mean ending donations to anti-abortion groups like Susan B Anthony List as well as pro-women groups like Planned Parenthood & ending donations to Sierra’s Club as well as big oil advocates.

5934 2018-03-02 18:31:00 ...not to mention that under NAFTA the US has right of first refusal to Canadian oil & gas and FULL rights to it in times of crisis. Never was completely comfortable with that provision.
5935 2018-03-02 18:30:56 Ontario has an oil refinery in Sarnia. Quebec runs Ottawa. Those are facts.
5936 2018-03-02 18:30:38 8:8 Shall not their camps, in the days of heaven because of that man perished not alone at Ephesus, and to speak unto them in the place of the anointing oil, and oxen, that could deliver his people which is in heaven.

5940 2018-03-02 18:30:03 Boy needs to change the oil in that barn jacket. Or wear  Nomex underwear. That thing is a fire hazard.
5941 2018-03-02 18:29:45 But much else missed, including a 90-million-year mustard evolution tasting & the reason mustard oil is banned in North America and Europe! Have a listen...
5942 2018-03-02 18:29:30 Oil is currently plentiful on the world market.  To not hold these as a strategic reserve defies everything we know about the Middle East, Russia, Venezuela, Nigeria and other petrocracies.
5943 2018-03-02 18:29:19 The woman in front of me at chopt just now literally said word for word to the guy making her salad “don’t forget the oil while you’re tossing my salad” and I’m laughing like maniac
5944 2018-03-02 18:29:14 It's like an electric candle - it plugs into the wall, they have little felt pads that you put scent on and it scents your house. Or you put the scent in oil in a jar and there are diffuser reeds that stand up out of it that spread the scent around your house.

5966 2018-03-02 18:26:56 Discussing the Arab Spring in school is exhausting. US imperialist oil interest in the Middle East have completely destabilized the region. Along with Israeli and EU support destabilizing anti-western governments like Iraq and Libya.
5967 2018-03-02 18:26:54 Well said. These are snake oil con artists. We need to get to the bottom of who is planning this propaganda and make it stop. Then we have to heal a nation of Kool-Aid drinking narcissists.
5968 2018-03-02 18:26:44 We've been using peppermint. It seems to confuse larger ants, but these little ones don't even care. The cedar oil repels them really well. We had a whole nest of them in the mini barn last year and they up and vanished.

TARIFF THE HECK OUT OF THEM (PUSH THEM OUT) AND LETS PUT OUR ECONOMY INTO OVERDRIVE! PROBABLY EVEN GET DROP IN PRICE AT PUMP? OPEC ARTIFICIALLY PUMPED UP?
5972 2018-03-02 18:26:03 John, maybe I missed it but isn't there a national security issue to be considered. If we cede our capacity to produce steel and aluminum and we end up in war, then what? Same as ceding our capacity to produce oil and gas. We are screwed!
5973 2018-03-02 18:26:02 I don't think it's gonna happen... Also he's probably going to run a pretty good 40 time too... They said this morning if Barkley has over a 40-inch vertical and runs a for 4.4 40 he will blow the roof off Lucas Oil Stadium....1 down 1 to go

5978 2018-03-02 18:25:37 As long as we are exporting oil we need more capacity like KM expansion as opposed to Keystone. The US is manifestly an unreliable mkt

5982 2018-03-02 18:24:55 I’ll just finish on this America has been successfully able to disarm a whole (army)in a (foreign country) take oil while setting up a base in that country and your saying they can’t disarm a child with no military training also 54% of Americans voted trump to be racist 
5983 2018-03-02 18:24:49 Weak dollar benefits both mining and oil companies who sell in USD and pay employees in CAD. Only headwind is USD is dropping which is keeping the USD/CAD ratio from getting too wide. Weak CAD also not good for customers.

5988 2018-03-02 18:24:31 Yes that’s how that particular whale got it’s name. They were curious and would swim to the ships. So they were the “right “ whale to hunt. But that was when there was a demand for whale oil for lamps

5997 2018-03-02 18:23:19 You’re right. Zero to do with right now. My point was those coaches got the short end of the stick and should be given another opportunity. I think they’re both good. That been said the GM needs to be changed. The trades he has made is appalling.

6041 2018-03-02 18:18:54 If you’re straight edge: do you consider the use of CBD oil an ‘edge break’? Curious.
6042 2018-03-02 18:18:52 I’m at the car dealership getting an oil change and other car stuff done. I’m sitting in the “lounge” the TV in here is on the Chevy channel and whoever is in charge of the radio seems to just be hitting scan. This is a weird place
6043 2018-03-02 18:18:47 And you would be right, Layna.  People who are way smarter and waaaayyyy better informed than I am have demonstrated the links between the 2-bit Mafioso in the WH and the Russian Mob. 45 is definitely Putin's creature. 

Plus, there's much more than oil to this.

6046 2018-03-02 18:18:19 This is a great graphic. Thanks! 

Hopefully the length and steepness of the AB down slope gives people some understanding that this is not just a short-run oil-price-related blip. It's a staggering change for such a short period of time. 

Can you share a link to this story?
6047 2018-03-02 18:18:18 Trade places, staggered truth or dare
Only ask it if you care
Trace back to all the millionaires
Snake oil traiders, no one shares
Soulless and stealing what they dare

Make it take it they won't share
6048 2018-03-02 18:18:08 So its Quebec fault?? You do realize that they do generate alot of  Hydro and their Prov. Govt is Liberal like ON.... If you are gonna get angry with PQ why not ON? Wynne has done more against Oil Patch than PQ to be fair...

6119 2018-03-02 18:09:10 You introduced this to us, but I've found its data sheet dated 2008 and the product brochure 2011, so it's been around awhile already. It seems to be an antioxidant with the comparison to Vit E, but the oil here has tocopherol and BHT as well. The other sunscreen had AP by (1)

DOES THAT TASTE LIKE MISERY?
6133 2018-03-02 18:07:18 they did. Also, roster is much deeper than people think and confidence changes everything. As does having a lack confidence and the latter doesn't mean players aren't trying.

6159 2018-03-02 18:04:18 Oil burn is very common on European cars and getting more common on American cars. A quart to a quart and a half between oil changes isn’t unheard of. The rings are loose so the grooves fill with carbon stiction and you get oil seepage and blow by.

6161 2018-03-02 18:03:55 You must be referring to “self sabotage” that Your beloved Hugo instituted as dictator. Your country stupidly relied on oil and oil alone as your golden goose, then killed any other economic source. You import everything/produce nothing. Can’t eat oil.
6162 2018-03-02 18:03:47 Idk but I'd just get a basic kind for oil buildup and then use peppermint or tea tree oil on your scalp for itchiness
6163 2018-03-02 18:03:43 I can only eat things that have sour cream or a cold sub with oil and vinegar 
6164 2018-03-02 18:03:40 it shouldn't take 3 hours for an Oil change

6179 2018-03-02 18:02:52 Small change. They’re probably laughing all the way to their oil wells
6180 2018-03-02 18:02:50 @barzaboyf9  for real they good... Money helps a lot, like it it for man utd, Chelsea, and other around the world. Be it oil money or not. But we do take in account the trophies won when claiming a team is the best ever.

6196 2018-03-02 18:00:44 Until the greed of the elite still is insatiable, people will be killed in their innocence. Oil is the target, gas and water. But the victims are our neighbours our friends our families. The greedy do not care who they kill in order for them to have more than everyone else.
6197 2018-03-02 18:00:27 So i just found out that my jeep’s oil leak isnt in the oil pan gasket, but the oil pressure sensor..... and to make it better i already purchased the fucking gasket

6204 2018-03-02 17:59:50 The Yoruba must realize that they need the help of the eastern tribes and the oil rich regions as much as the easterners are ready to work together for a common goal.
6205 2018-03-02 17:59:50 So Luke Oil's taking over the liquor store business in #nwindiana. Interesting ...
6206 2018-03-02 17:59:34 Does an increase in the oil price have the same effect?
6207 2018-03-02 17:59:28 Can she and her governemnt focus on the need to export our natural resources properly. Get the oil to the coasts and lets compete in that market place. #oilsands 
But steel is an Ontario industry so the government runs to the rescue.

We are burning midnight oil for BSNL so can't tolerate Corruption.
And if it is fabricated attempt then it must stop.
6211 2018-03-02 17:59:16 "Viscous" means having a thick consistency, like motor oil. Is that really what you meant? Learn English if you want to live in America.
6212 2018-03-02 17:59:09 This is like finding out the invasion of Iraq was about oil. Like...yeah.
6213 2018-03-02 17:58:51 A5 CH 14:  In 6th grade we could discuss the chemistry of olive oil with the digestive system and circulatory system.  The fatty acids leading to heart disease of other oils, where olive oil is much lower.

6219 2018-03-02 17:58:13 Higher oil prices, higher new manufacturing orders
6220 2018-03-02 17:57:50 And if we cut off you hydro and oil or charge a 25% tariff you can't make your steel
6221 2018-03-02 17:57:45 India increased their crude palm oil import tax to 44% from 30%, also lifting their refined palm oil import tax to 54% from the previous 40%.

6223 2018-03-02 17:57:41 Once you’ve hydrated your skin (increased its water content), you need to moisturize it (prevent water from leaving the skin). I actually just use jojoba oil and rosehip oil for this.
6224 2018-03-02 17:57:40 But they won't help. Africa doesn't have oil......
6225 2018-03-02 17:57:35 I’m getting my oil changed and now the anxiety begins

6233 2018-03-02 17:56:52 May I suggest coconut oil to help with healing and fading. Last year I had my femur cut in half and an incision from my knee to my hip. 2 days ago it was barely noticeable until they had to cut it open again. But I’ll be going back to coconut oil again once the staples are out.
6234 2018-03-02 17:56:39 Alan , we hear and see you
6235 2018-03-02 17:56:33 To be clear; Alberta energy supports jobs. Albertas' NDP government destroys oil & gas jobs and Coal based communities.
6236 2018-03-02 17:56:33 You need some oil, bot?
6237 2018-03-02 17:56:33 Nah, Like the oil curse, it's determined by circumstance & history shows the government & country will end up with corruption & lack of development due to the one main resources. Oil curse like Banana Republic passes no judgement on the people. I don't know where u got that from?

6240 2018-03-02 17:56:17 How about we leave the oil in the ground, and invest all we've got in renewable energy instead?

That way, should we need more oil at a later date, we'll still have some!

OR we could just strip the planet and make off like bandits. 

(By "we" I mean a very few select bastards)
6241 2018-03-02 17:56:17 Bro why the fuck am I at work lol I could be changing my oil enjoying the day.

6247 2018-03-02 17:55:12 Conspiracy claims are old hat for corporations under scrutiny for misleading the public. Big Tobacco made the same moves as Big Oil. Don't fall for it.
6248 2018-03-02 17:55:12 Pres. Trump told oil and #corn industry representatives Thursday that he supported changing U.S. #biofuels policy in a way that would limit costs to refiners while expanding sales of #ethanol.

The thing that makes mining coins fast is the same thing that makes rendering games fast. You'd have to basically redesign the entire GPU to not hurt both groups, and that's called an FPGA.

"mining optimized" GPU drivers is snake oil.

6261 2018-03-02 17:53:22 This is what happens when you force socialism on a population and place all economic future on one source (in this case, oil). They lured farmers away from farming and chased away/closed companies that couldn’t survive ridiculous fixed pricing. Now what?

6268 2018-03-02 17:52:35 So ln a customer told me “ you think I’m ganna feed this to my kid ?!!”

6271 2018-03-02 17:51:43 People seem to think we can ditch oil and move to renewable energy, but our tech (including renewables tech) is based on oil by-products and rare earth minerals. Not one person has answered me on how to deal with this problem.

6281 2018-03-02 17:51:05 Saudi Arabia is bombing Yemen to steal its oil. S A has stolen 65% of Yemen’s oil. Yemen also has gas. S A has about 9 years of oil left. That was the answer, here’s the question: ‘Why is Saudi Arabia bombing children in Yemen????
6282 2018-03-02 17:51:02 Probably because they’re water or mineral oil based; Get one that’s wax based

6289 2018-03-02 17:50:08 @DrBarrySears Are you saying coconut oil is inflammatory?
6290 2018-03-02 17:49:46 Interesting. I've no view on indices for weeks now but crushed pair trading/macro this week. Short oil, long SNAP against short AMD. Long CLF and AKS. You can't argue that looks like aversion though... and the bounce happening now seems to be confirming
6291 2018-03-02 17:49:34 War for profits! That is the real meaning of all war, profit, money, military contracts, oil, resources, control.
6292 2018-03-02 17:49:26 This is especially reticent, I think, since russia under went several periods of major military defunding in order to get in the Black and with the Russian oil sanctions. I’m not sure if russia can afford to flaunt a new and modern nuclear arsenal.

6299 2018-03-02 17:48:08 Yeah like what exactly can we do without leverage on any sector, not export oil? They have plenty of production, food? They produce more than us - wheat, hardwood ? They already put tariffs on that, fish/lobster? They got lots too, maybe fresh water is only thing we can get em on

6304 2018-03-02 17:47:36 Not true. If we had subsidised our coal the same as they did on mainland Europe it would've been the cheapest, but we didn't. We destroyed the industry and now pay for weapons instead to "secure" our oil overseas and sit praying Putin won't turn the gas off.
6305 2018-03-02 17:47:36 Sesame seed oil has to be the elixir of the gods. This stuff tastes so damn good
6306 2018-03-02 17:47:24 They are welcome!
6307 2018-03-02 17:47:14 Random things that have blown into my back yard so far: two bags, empty milk container, empty motor oil container, empty cigarette pack, some kind of ball. Stand by for updates. #windstorm
6308 2018-03-02 17:47:09 Can you either photoshop in a shampoo and leave-in oil treatment or take this pic down?  Its very upsetting.
6309 2018-03-02 17:47:02 When you go get an oil change and you get scared about what they are gonna say! I know I know, just burn it down and start over! 
6310 2018-03-02 17:46:56 The bacon I was trying to fry stuck itself to the packet and then dramatically threw itself into the pan, causing the oil to go all over my hand :'(
6311 2018-03-02 17:46:55 Just rubbed coconut oil on my girls yeeks. We bouta go find some food now y’all be cool.
6312 2018-03-02 17:46:53 My weed and oil came in the mail today. I’m very pleased 
6313 2018-03-02 17:46:50 How many miners died over the decades when the mines were the best on earth but they sacked them shut the power stations bankrupted us with oil and gas we had to import lied about coal global warming Antarctica and then set upon us with a beating for that we had not done?
6314 2018-03-02 17:46:47 The oil may run out one day but on the bright side we'll never have an arsehole shortage
6315 2018-03-02 17:46:35 this is foolish... do you also trade in their currency? half in USD and half in their currency... why the f*** they will trade only in USD? Also, other countries will stop buying oil in USD... is it ok and fair game for you?
6316 2018-03-02 17:46:23 Me: “I am an independent woman who needs no help from anyone”

Also me: *calls my grandma to come with me bc I don’t want to get an oil change alone*
6317 2018-03-02 17:46:15 I forgot to add neem oil to a wholesale order that I placed like a week ago, and now I'm looking at places to buy it in stores and it's like 30x the price.
6318 2018-03-02 17:46:14 @IkejaElectric I'm totally disappointed at the way u guys handle outages, we haven't had lite for 4days just cause u guys refused to supply oil for our transformer at Ajao Estate in Anthony and u call urselves a revamped private company SMH

6322 2018-03-02 17:45:53 We are waiting
6323 2018-03-02 17:45:50 Spare of the moment thing putting @jodieledger argan oil on my hair before drying it in a rush to go out. Only just told me I need a tiny bit. Might as well get me a leather jacket that says T-Birds on the back because I’m going out as Grease lightening tonight fuck sake
6324 2018-03-02 17:45:45 Engr., the response is not for u. Thanks
6325 2018-03-02 17:45:44 But surely oil isn’t a commodity any right minded country would like to have? ‘cause I read in the daily record oil was bad and that it’s running out and that it’s not ours in fact we should just ignore it, oh and renewable energy that’s bad also.
6326 2018-03-02 17:45:27 FACT: Gaddafi HAD INDEED been preparing to launch a 'gold dinar for oil trade' with all of Africa's 200 million people and other countries interested. He had indeed been

6329 2018-03-02 17:45:16 Gotta go get an oil change today smh let's see what else they tell me is wrong with my whip 
6330 2018-03-02 17:45:11 LOL. The Socialists fired all the oil refinery managers and replaced them with faithful socialists. Now they have 3 times as many workers producing 1/3 the amount of oil, people eating dog food, and you can't get toilet paper. Ahhh, Paradise
6331 2018-03-02 17:45:04 Because of their aroma & the oil of the islands ylang ylang plant (used in many perfumes), the Comoros are known as “The Perfume Isles” #GeoFacts #Perfume
6332 2018-03-02 17:44:52 I have no idea. The "oil curse" passes no judgement on the people or the government. Banana republic does
6333 2018-03-02 17:44:51 Jameson, I want to some day get employed in the crypto / blockchain space. I’m sick of working on an oil rig, I’ve found a passion for crypto and blockchain, any advice on getting started? Thanks in advance...

6335 2018-03-02 17:44:44 $300 to change oil in the Mercedes 
6336 2018-03-02 17:44:44 Offshore drilling is safer today than ever before. Oil is a natural resource. Why let a natural resource do nothing? Why not use it to reduce the tax burden on #Californians?
6337 2018-03-02 17:44:30 Yeah the coconut. Oil I thought was just me

6340 2018-03-02 17:44:01 I smell like a different essential oil everyday after work 
6341 2018-03-02 17:43:53 And I need an oil change
6342 2018-03-02 17:43:50 Actually, fossil fuels are what is keeping the future generations warm this winter.  I'm actually a huge proponent of nuclear.  Keep believing in the silly stereotype that if you don't believe in man-made climate change, then you MUST be solely in the pocket of Big Oil.
6343 2018-03-02 17:43:48 Humanity will pay the price too.
Population sustainability is at a point of collapse.
All these extinction events were an opp to act/change but dismissed by oil $, corrupt politicians and obliging MSM that allowed *false* naratives.
There's a lot of *stupid, dumbass* out there.
6344 2018-03-02 17:43:31 bruhhh auto zone sold me an oil filter without an o ring in it and it made me think i had an oil leak 
6345 2018-03-02 17:43:28 Sorry you got me wrong,thats not close to my intent
6346 2018-03-02 17:43:25 to help us remember all he did,
 at the #BillyGrahamFuneral
everybody gets a 10oz bottle of Snake oil
6347 2018-03-02 17:43:23 Yh its really good and inexpensive, especially with a little tea tree oil.
6348 2018-03-02 17:43:21 So wrong. Oil & fossil fuels generally enabled modern civilisation. Billions of us wouldn't exist without it. Tobacco has only ever been a deadly recreational drug.
6349 2018-03-02 17:43:19 As all nations with informed & forward-thinking leaders move away from oil. Financial institutions as well.

6356 2018-03-02 17:42:35 Oil
 Can be used sublingual, oral, or infused with food or drink.
6357 2018-03-02 17:42:34 They ship the oil to refineries where we make gasoline and other products.  Some of it even ‘gasp’ then gets exported. A trade war would go poorly for Canada. If Canada had to ship oil on boats rather than pipeline they would be screwed because of the cost.
6358 2018-03-02 17:42:08 One more thing for those who think the dollar will crash. If we trade less there is less need for dollars and therefore get reduced.  Let the Chinese have the reserve currency which requires deval, and keep importing oil and food.  LOL
6359 2018-03-02 17:42:02 Excellent,  now we have enough oil to last hundreds of years and keep America great. We probably won't need to ever access it anyway
6360 2018-03-02 17:42:01 #Pressurewasher Tips: Always check the oil and gas levels on a gas power washer. Only use unleaded gasoline.
6361 2018-03-02 17:41:23 I've just got electric again since this morning, that with no oil, you can imagine my mood - hint storm named after!!

6366 2018-03-02 17:40:06 The oil companies invested large $ to prep oil rigs and platforms able to cope with it. No better indicator.
6367 2018-03-02 17:39:58 Drove to get an oil change only for them to tell me my next one wasn’t due until 4-4-18  I forgot March existed tbh
6368 2018-03-02 17:39:58 do y'all have the evil fake butter oil or whatever it is they put on movie theater popcorn bc sometimes I feel like the only person who hates that nuclear goop
6369 2018-03-02 17:39:47 About to change the oil on my car for the first time ever. Let’s see how badly I can fuck this up.
6370 2018-03-02 17:39:41 When I would get my old Lexus’ oil change it would be like $30, I just pains $89 for an oil change. They hoed me or nah?
6371 2018-03-02 17:39:40 I asked if u call the oil curse racist? To be logically consistent. u would have to say it is racist too since like Banana Republic, it once applied to a region dominated by an ethnicity & now applies as a broad term to any country with similar tendencies regardless of ethnicity.
6372 2018-03-02 17:39:33 All that oil money
6373 2018-03-02 17:39:26 Tribes knew people business was more lucrative than tree oil. When you view humans as a commodity you do not get a pass. I recently posted CNN article after reading about Sara Forbes Bonetta who was escaped death in "tribal" war.
6374 2018-03-02 17:39:24 I need to attempt to get my oil changed
6375 2018-03-02 17:39:16 We are about to become the largest producer of oil in the world.  Not sure that is ‘poor’
6376 2018-03-02 17:39:16 C'mon, get it right, Kai. Partial upgraders that turn bitumen into medium or heavy crude oil. Potentially no diluted bitumen for TMX, which has been one of your biggest beefs, right?
6377 2018-03-02 17:39:16 Just to put some oil in the fire: typically you need not to worry about it; but some people are successfully advocating Inspiratory muscle training. So much for the analogy   
6378 2018-03-02 17:39:12 We really have no point other than just wanting to chime in and throw a little heat around.  We hear Hall demanded a trade upon the closing of Oil City
6379 2018-03-02 17:39:06 What a paradox! Nigeria: sixth largest producer of crude oil and now the world's largest importer of petroleum products. #Nationainruins

6382 2018-03-02 17:38:12 So having a stupid amount of calls mostly Gas boilers not working. This is the cause. Condense pipes freezing and blocking. Simple kettle over them a few times should clear it then reset your boiler. Oil boilers it’s likely already frozen being rural so go check 
6383 2018-03-02 17:37:55 90's R&B music videos we're out of control, you got people butt naked, pouring oil on each other, And R.Kelly everywhere...
6384 2018-03-02 17:37:41 Can definitely say I’ve had oil joints now. Had a Thai stick not long ago and it was delicious  
6385 2018-03-02 17:37:40 Trump all talk and no walk you think steel and wood is a bad deal for the mighty USA then do what you know you can't do rip up NAFTA stop trading. You don't need our oil , wood, steal ,food or tourist.
6386 2018-03-02 17:37:34 Yea got very hot. That's melted plastic on oil pickup tube
6387 2018-03-02 17:37:33 Sadly, plans are also underway to drill for oil in the pristine Ruby Mountains of Nevada.

6389 2018-03-02 17:37:12 So Vegas is good because of good coaching & a good general manager? Or because the players took it upon themselves to play hard determined smart hockey?
6390 2018-03-02 17:37:06 I smell a rat selling snake oil.
6391 2018-03-02 17:37:05 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
6392 2018-03-02 17:37:00 77% of pipeline construction is from Steel. So it will kill the oil pipeline construction that Trump is so fond of.
6393 2018-03-02 17:36:48 My dad spoils me & I overdo it sometimes without realizing it. He waited up for me to get home last night just to put oil in my car.

6404 2018-03-02 17:34:57 He placed a hand on his teacher’s shoulder. Just then, a group of women walked into the flower field to collect seeds for making oil. As always, his attention was on but one of them.

Her name was Sky in the Grass.

6405 2018-03-02 17:34:51 Genie Oil's website says 'they're exploring for oil and gas in Northern Israel'....which means either Syria or Lebanon!
6406 2018-03-02 17:34:32 But then he found a well oil machine that assembled by Baxter.for me the man needs to get off that high horse he's not ready for big teams
6407 2018-03-02 17:34:24  . Didn’t they used to load shotguns with rock salt? So maybe condiments ... or oils! Pick up your gun oil and your olive oil on the same shelf. Easy-peasy.
6408 2018-03-02 17:34:21 Aaand with trademark consummate timing I have run out of heating oil.

#sneachta #BeastFromTheEast
6409 2018-03-02 17:34:21 But knowing how greedy our oil marketers have become recently, can we ever have a market where oil price drops just because of availability of product/competition?
6410 2018-03-02 17:34:08 #AmazonEcho is down nationwide right now and I’m not sure I remember how I operated my light bulbs before? Like do they need oil or?

6412 2018-03-02 17:33:52 TEA TREE OIL IS A SPOT TREATMENT FOR ACNE AND DRIES OUT THE OILS IN UR SKIN BITCH DONT GET IT TWISTED
6413 2018-03-02 17:33:52 Almost looks like an oil painting! Hey, I wonder if there’s oil there? You know, we should have a few oil companies do some exploratory drilling...just to be on the safe side.
6414 2018-03-02 17:33:49 Do you work at an oil company? I work at an oil sands company and it sounds eerily similar
6415 2018-03-02 17:33:47 I don't run any gigs but I've just purchased beard oil and beard balm for longer days. You should try conedy collective. A lot of good chat on there.

 Hope this helps.

6417 2018-03-02 17:33:36 I use the yes to tomato face wash and I tone with witch hazel. Then I moisturize with either vitamin e oil + argon oil or the neutrogena hydro gel moisturizer
6418 2018-03-02 17:33:33 Evidence is all in our population. India import edible oil & no food safety issue has aroused other than fear mongering by elites
6419 2018-03-02 17:33:28 That’s important news. Uzbeks used to boil people in oil. Or was that CIA misinformation circa 2005?

6425 2018-03-02 17:32:56 When I was little my favorite radio show was Knock On Wood with @stevecharney and his ventriloquist dummy Harry.  There isn't a day that has gone by that I don't think about who listened to that pitch and was like "Ventriloquism on the radio?  Stop drilling you've struck oil!!"
6426 2018-03-02 17:32:56 Oil, not corn, has been driving up global food prices. The World Bank conducted research determining crude oil as the #1 determinant of global food prices. The cost of energy is integral to so much of the 84% that goes into food that when the price of oil goes up, so does food.

6434 2018-03-02 17:32:24 Only because it actually affects Ontario.  When Alberta's oil industry is punished, who cares, right?  It's just Western Canada.

6437 2018-03-02 17:31:59 Salt yes; never oil. Oil does nothing useful during cooking.
6438 2018-03-02 17:31:44 It's cause they don't use the right kind of oil...
6439 2018-03-02 17:31:32 Oh shit, did I miss America getting invaded?  Or are you talking about yet another illegal oil war your corrupt government tricked you into fighting for them?  And you call other people sheep? Aye, good one mate.
6440 2018-03-02 17:31:25 Have you not heard of the oil curse? & "ignore the conditions of how these "regimes" come about to blame it on the people. The implication is that some people are  too ignorant to have good government."
6441 2018-03-02 17:31:06 @BenafshaSoona  Apply Coconut oil and massage for 20 mins so that oil absorbs the color and then remobe through cotton pad and then apply again and keep it for 30 mins to 1 hour and then Rinse it off.
Btw Happpyyy Holi
6442 2018-03-02 17:31:05 That means you’re doing it all wrong. Toss with a little olive oil, s&p and grill it. It’s magic.

6446 2018-03-02 17:30:11 Apply hot oil with turmeric powder and galric.
6447 2018-03-02 17:30:05 I think @djclimenhaga is right 2 remind Albertans how we chose to lower income & other taxes, stay “sales tax free” (The Alberta Advantage) & basically pay our taxes pumping oil out of the ground. Result: cities bloated with greedy migrants & a “something for nothing” society
6448 2018-03-02 17:30:03 Add oil bb
6449 2018-03-02 17:30:02 #FunFact Motul introduced thei first semi-synthetic motor oil in 1966.
6450 2018-03-02 17:29:50 It's like the oil companies.  When the price of a barrel of oil increases by a dollar, they only raise the price of gas 1 cent.

6451 2018-03-02 17:29:42 Ziggie there's something really special about your face oil, I was so glad I got to try it. It's in my skincare bag now :)  Congratulations, it's beautiful  x
6452 2018-03-02 17:29:21 I prefer any soup to leaves with oil on them.
6453 2018-03-02 17:29:17 aw shit yeah.

i recently had a mccains revelation: you're supposed to roast them in a pan w/ oil 

i'm still shook
6454 2018-03-02 17:29:06 And frequently dressed as vaginas.
6455 2018-03-02 17:29:06 Much like the same treatment the Feds inflicted on Alberta oil ...except now when another country does the same it is now bad.. GHG emissions from the iron and steel industry  should be taxed or shut down ..maybe a dairy compromise would help?
6456 2018-03-02 17:28:54 Thank you so much for sharing, @kkjacobs70! We are confident that you will find you love this oil as much as we do!
6457 2018-03-02 17:28:50 turmeric cleansing oil is single-handedly saving my skin. these are government secrets they don't want u to kno

6460 2018-03-02 17:28:41 @DeutscheBank IMO since 90's in DB some advisers & executives have made huge mistakes getting involved in junk derivatives, Oil+ Gas, Iraq War, Syria , etc. who recommended that ? Are they still there ?
6461 2018-03-02 17:28:20 Stop taking credit for stuff that @BarackObama handed down to you! Bush put us into a 8 yr. War for Oil and Obama was handed a Country in a Recession! He worked his ass off for 8 yrs. putting this Country back together again and you come along & try to take credit for it? NOOOTT!

Weekly oil treatments and conditions. Trimming my ends every 6 weeks etc.
6468 2018-03-02 17:27:03 Nothing like Hubby (whose really allergic to nuts) eating something at work that was cooked in a nut oil. Had an allergic reaction, he spent MOST of his day in the ER, getting 2 epi pen injections, & other things. SCARY & today he's back at work. He's so stubborn sometimes!
6469 2018-03-02 17:26:40 Yes thank you, although I haven't been out since Tuesday! I am warm but have run out of oil for the heating and &  get a delivery until 16th I have a log burner and enough wood for I don't know how long. My burner eats it up! However, my daughter keeps ringing to check up on me
6470 2018-03-02 17:26:39 As long as Americans are willing to pay more for their products. Maybe we can pay more, buy less, and be satisfied. If this is successful, should we consider high tariffs on Apple and Samsung cell phones and tablets?
What about imported oil and gas? Fish? Avocados? Autos?
6471 2018-03-02 17:26:27 yes if they had kept their guns somehow this would have stopped the corrupt govt from being overly reliant on oil revenue or maybe one has nothing to do with the other
6472 2018-03-02 17:26:25 La csg pour les retraites le gaz oil. Que font ils de tout cet qrgent !! L’analyse de la cour des comptes donne une petite explication

6476 2018-03-02 17:25:32 We have an ant problem. My wife's going into the (very spacious) crawlspace to spray cedar oil.

She just put on a tie-dye t-shirt and bandanna, with mascara on her cheeks as war paint. ... I think she's finally lost it. It was a very weak-backed camel to begin with.
6477 2018-03-02 17:25:28 Man I been in this hoe 2 hours waiting to get my oil changed

6485 2018-03-02 17:24:22 Is this a government for the people? Trump EPA moves to roll back more fuel pollution rules. The Trump administration said Thursday it is rewriting rules governing pollution from oil, gas and coal ash dumps, that  will significantly weaken protections for health and environment.
6486 2018-03-02 17:24:17 I love the smell of garlic being cooked in extra virgin olive oil 
6487 2018-03-02 17:24:16 And that's exactly why you've been bankrupt many times over. Thank God your dad made your money-left up to you,you'd be slinging fake insurance policies to seniors without your inheritance cash.Snake oil salesman.
6488 2018-03-02 17:24:14 I heard you can cover oil from Houston, not sure, might want to look into that.
6489 2018-03-02 17:24:12 Apply almond oil on your body before heading out for Holi celebration. Sun exposure can have a detrimental effect on the skin. If you have dry skin, first apply the sunscreen, wait for a few minutes and then apply a moisturizer. #HoliBeautysecret @jovees_herbal
6490 2018-03-02 17:24:09 Remember 90%+ of ROI’s gas/oil come from the UK; 50% of your land exports are to the UK and ALL of your fishing fleet fishes in UNITED KINGDOM waters (2/3)

6492 2018-03-02 17:24:02 This is the first time I waited an hour and a half for an oil change 
6493 2018-03-02 17:24:01 And to think there's no crude Oil in the ground in those locations.

6496 2018-03-02 17:23:30 Analysts state that Crude Oil prices are expected to be bullish as a result of the future tariff on steal and aluminum. #SUACCS18
6497 2018-03-02 17:23:27 Huge shoutout to @doterra for replacing an oil that exploded in transit to my home. Customer service was super nice and very helpful!!
6498 2018-03-02 17:23:20 Gonna need all the buckets of water to cool that burn.
6499 2018-03-02 17:23:19 Oil changes can be a pain! Do you always keep up with getting it changed?
6500 2018-03-02 17:23:07 Definitely call BS. Here's what the real working class "know." Obama's "hop-scotch" jobs growth is like his deport record. PT/Temp jobs. Work 30 days...laid-off, 30 days..hire back.
Trumps jobs are permanent. We are booming in the oil& gas industry. We are steadily hiring.
6501 2018-03-02 17:22:50 gotta go get my oil changed at 1:00
6502 2018-03-02 17:22:43 Celebrated #Holi with poor & unprivileged kids, they didn't had money to purchase colours so I asked them to use mud, burnt mobil oil etc. Sad part is that they didn't had cameras or SM accounts to brag off all this social work of theirs.

6504 2018-03-02 17:22:37 Aaaaaaaaand we’re out of heating oil. So, y’know, couldn’t have planned that better.

Sechin stated in interview couple of years ago now that Putin had a 'grand plan'.
Interview in FT; the GP is that RU-Saudi & Exxon would form partnership & control global OIL market=power. Add China & DONE
6513 2018-03-02 17:21:51 3 weeks on and still no reply to my request for a refund given it has never worked. @Oil_Pal have provided the worst service I've received in years and won't even acknowledge my email let alone put it right, time to pass to the credit card company to deal with them.
6514 2018-03-02 17:21:46 i HATE coconut oil. it makes my skin and hair dry af. it’s all hype. doesn’t work for many (maybe even most) people. olive oil or castor oil are better choices for my hair, and vitamin e oil for my skin.

6524 2018-03-02 17:20:40 My natural hair is four much work. I have to scratch tf out of my scalp & comb the hair out before washing or washing makes no sense.

6530 2018-03-02 17:20:12 I did read that peppermint oil or peppermint plants in your house keeps them away.
6531 2018-03-02 17:20:05 Every society is a living organismen and evolve with the issues it have.  Oil business is going to vanish in a few decades, the arabs will no longer have the money to finance terrorism.
6532 2018-03-02 17:19:52 Admit it Cam. Your agenda to protect US oil interests has been exposed.  Is this actually the argument being used by serious people in the media or politics?!?

Are they really suggesting a conspiracy in which we all are pretending to care about climate change, water, safety...

6538 2018-03-02 17:19:18 by your logic, the #OilCurse is racist too since it has the very same effect & was once mostly applied to Arab countries & yet now applies to pretty much every oil country except Norway..

6545 2018-03-02 17:18:52 The trade deficit is not a deficit that can be balanced. It has to do with the strength of the dollar, our productivity, and the fact that we import low-cost stuff like food and oil, and export stuff like iPhones and cars.
6546 2018-03-02 17:18:41 Another shame. We can't refine our crude oil to petrol locally. After over 60 yrs of crude oil export. Petrol import can't sustain needed economic growth.
6547 2018-03-02 17:18:39 And of course, when any movement in a discussion occurs, accusations of capitulation begin.

6553 2018-03-02 17:18:20 Probably the worst part is even without a major disruption because of ever increasing oil consumption combined with crossing the apex of global oil production we are going to see oil prices eventually cripple things anyways.

6564 2018-03-02 17:17:10 This posturing for war with Iran (or even North Korea) would be a disaster for our precarious global economy. If Iranian oil was knocked off the market it would cause oil prices to skyrocket which the global economy cannot bare.
6565 2018-03-02 17:17:08 "filth" lmao okay Hun. Even though it's been scientifically proven to have medicinal benefits and no deaths as a result of smoking it. And we've even got legal CBD oil in the UK now, how can that be filth? The only criminal thing about cannabis is that it's been made illegal!

6573 2018-03-02 17:15:35 Like the article says we have been using debt as a substitute for loss of EROI with oil to maintain our standards of living & this is even less sustainable. The moment the oil markets are significantly disrupted it will trigger the next recession.

6583 2018-03-02 17:14:37 It's as if he knows jail is for "the little people" and not himself. After all, he's never done time after screwing thousands of people over decades. Pure hubris runs through his snake oil veins.

6589 2018-03-02 17:13:52 Definitely not bread! But you can make fat balls from melted coconut oil (vegan staple, right) and muesli, or any chopped nut/seed mix.
6590 2018-03-02 17:13:48 Why does the NRA have such unfettered access to Trump. If we want change, our choice is simple, get rid of political contributions from oil, coal, large corporations and organizations. Trump is a pawn to them instead of an advocate for citizens. #RESIST
6591 2018-03-02 17:13:45 Whenever I hear some “spiritual person” proselytizing the psychic-healing benefits of crystals, I'm reminded that petroleum jelly used to be marketed as a beauty cream. Yes, people smeared oil jelly on their faces for it's magical beauty benefits. “Crystals” are rocks, people.
6592 2018-03-02 17:13:31 Thank you! I didn't think it was an oil slick. My first impression was probably it could just be some spilt oil, but then I saw it extended all along the path, and uniformly.
It looks good. Post a picture of an inlaid fish tile when you go there again.

6602 2018-03-02 17:12:26 Does anyone doubt that big oil has the resources to muddy the water in the climate change debate the same way big tabacco did a few decades ago, regarding the safety vs. danger of cigarette smoking?

6617 2018-03-02 17:10:46 probably not in the news but news worthy, 200 russians were killed in syria by US soldiers. the russians were going to take over parts of syria that appealed to them, oil refineries. damn, that’s what happens when u try to take something that isn’t yours to take. #FreeUkraine
6618 2018-03-02 17:10:44 Well it’s a snowball effect isn’t it? As frustrations grow due to one problem, it creates other problems. Infighting and lack of motivation.

6730 2018-03-04 23:51:57 @CoolDaddyGroove thanks for the oil recommend. Wife uses some and I have been using hers and the necklace she has. Got some of each ordered for myself now.
6731 2018-03-04 23:51:37 LOL so I was gonna buy the Kiehls Midnight Recovery Oil (£38) and the Nightly Refining Micro-Peel Concentrate (£41) to help revive my skin but decided to try samples first so I don’t waste my money...
6732 2018-03-04 23:51:37 When does one have a “yoga problem”? When your monthly lesson & essential oil expenditures exceed $400 or when you spend half of your last therapy session crying about how much shavasana means to you? Asking for a friend. #yoga
6733 2018-03-04 23:51:24 Getting out of the shower and smothering urself in coconut oil is 10/10
6734 2018-03-04 23:51:24 Oh lets just forget that UK has sold more oil for less and that Norway is rich and UK 
HAS NEAR BANKRUPTED AN OIL RICH COUNTRY
aye lets stop being obssessed about that
6735 2018-03-04 23:51:23 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
6736 2018-03-04 23:51:06 We already have one. In #Clydebank there is the Titan Crane. Just one crane. No longer used. Before Thatcher there were FOURTEEN of them there. All building ships and oil rigs. That one @TitanCrane is her saddest monument 
6737 2018-03-04 23:50:53 Is he aware 45% of all oil imports come from Canada?
6738 2018-03-04 23:50:35 bearish oil 61.60 $100 billion
6739 2018-03-04 23:50:23 Very simple, but tasty - sweet potato cut into chunks, red onion, red and orange peppers, garlic, veggie sausages mixed together with wholegrain mustard, paprika, oil and S+P. Roast for about an hour! SO GOOD!
6740 2018-03-04 23:50:20 Mountain Dew has oil in it I just realized 
6741 2018-03-04 23:50:18 God be 3 drops of lavender oil in this child’s bath. I need my damn sleep tonight.
6742 2018-03-04 23:50:11 I'd bet on China out of those two, they're economy seems more stable long-term. Russia is way too dependent on oil
6743 2018-03-04 23:49:43 birth control!!!! and tea tree oil!
6744 2018-03-04 23:49:41 Lord have mercy the oil shall be great
6745 2018-03-04 23:49:32 getting cold in here air analysis good min venthere charge for air quality green yellow red yellow order more speed on vents need head cover too calling manufacturer letting them know sending empty barrels and engine oil barrels oil will be recycled

6747 2018-03-04 23:49:15 jane fonda needs some rosehip oil
6748 2018-03-04 23:48:56 oil money? do tell.
6749 2018-03-04 23:48:53 You are indeed correct. Norway was much poorer than Scotland in 1900 and in 1970 when oil was found in scottish and norwegian waters...........
6750 2018-03-04 23:48:48 Like LITERALLY everything. On a bit of a budget, so I went to a local market to buy some nuts and couldn't because everything had "heart healthy" canola oil. 
6751 2018-03-04 23:48:36 @morwennastar top tip - the mock duck is great, just need to know what to do with it. Rinse all the muck off it, squeeze dry, rip up, roast with some oil and 5-spice, toss in a bit of hoi sin, then roast some more until it starts to crisp up. perfect for crispy duck pancakes.
6752 2018-03-04 23:48:12 After 1: Pats 3 - Oil Kings 0

Nick Henry (12) and Jake Leschyshyn (17) with powerplay goals in the 1st. Sam Steel (26) added to the lead with a shorthanded goal late in the frame.

6753 2018-03-04 23:47:54 Interesting 3 letters: Dutch-style political will, we've got the mud, and oil and gas industry hammerlock on denial of #climatechange
6754 2018-03-04 23:47:44 Geesh that sucks. They say CBD oil works wonders for people.
6755 2018-03-04 23:47:43 I'm glad u had a good day I knowhopefully we smash them when we play them next reallying on oil money at least we make our own money from being such a massive club.i had a good day thanks hope u did as well mate
6756 2018-03-04 23:47:10 Just bought my dog some CBD oil 
6757 2018-03-04 23:46:39 Spell rating: water breathing
This spell will not keep you from drowning in wine, oil, or any substance other than water. It will not save you from bad air. Neither the Void.
For all that it's still pretty useful. The seas are full of treasures. 3/5 #sstabz #dnd
6758 2018-03-04 23:46:27 When is Oil Change starting back up??  #HereComeTheOilers
6759 2018-03-04 23:46:24 Avoid taking showers with hot water for a long time. By doing so, you’re helping your skin preserve its natural oil leaving it feeling soft.
6760 2018-03-04 23:46:24 Cui Bono? Who are the financial  winners if overly optimistic projections for renewables turn out to be wrong?

(Spoiler - gas, oil, coal, and investment bankers that support those industries. Tax collecting entities. Freight rail. Tanker owners. Pipelines.)
6761 2018-03-04 23:46:09 If you really wanna drain the swamp, just leave Mueller in place indefinitely. He’s starting to pull on the strings that could unravel the whole thing. 

He’s looking at oil money, real estate, big investment funds and political contributions? Hoo boy.
6762 2018-03-04 23:46:03 nice nice, i changed my cars oil, and cleaned my toy, now to relax a bit until 5ish to take a friend to work, and see a horror film at my best friends house

6768 2018-03-04 23:44:36 olive oil????
6769 2018-03-04 23:44:33 Put an olive oil hair mask on and my hair literally smells like flora... it’s making me feel so sick
6770 2018-03-04 23:44:33 Please who knows where I can get pure unadulterated coconut oil for my baby’s hair?
6771 2018-03-04 23:44:13 Who is using CBD oil for their pain relief or illness? #CBD
6772 2018-03-04 23:44:13 Funny how the headlines on Friday were talking up the big comeback in Libyan oil production, then over the weekend one of their large fields is said to be shutdown.
6773 2018-03-04 23:44:11 Oil spills can severely affect the environment around it. Hundreds of thousands of fish of all kinds have been killed by oil spills. We need to be more careful and prevent this.
6774 2018-03-04 23:44:06 NEW WAVE KNOW: JORJA JACKBOOTS AS AGENT OF MEDIUM OIL!!!
6775 2018-03-04 23:43:46 Despite technicals favoring #Gold and positioning favoring #Silver, both may come under pressure in the ST if 5-Star and Northern League can form a majority govt in Italy and #Euro slides / #DXY rallies. S&P & Oil could suffer too.
6776 2018-03-04 23:43:41 Well..in the pre-shale era, there was no material production response to price. That's why the opec cartel was able to keep oil prices close to 100$ for nearly a decade.
6777 2018-03-04 23:43:39 Oh here you are, so you know and remember at least where you put the oil, not bad. Anyway you will find the next ticket in the telephone, a red building very small that reminds you London on your desk...come on i know you can find it...
6778 2018-03-04 23:43:37 Uhmmmm That does look delicious i see olive oil being used i assume that was freshly squeezed.
6779 2018-03-04 23:43:30 Grapes get crushed to make wine. Olives are pressed to make oil.
Diamonds are made under pressure. Seeds grow in darkness.
If you feel crushed, pressed, pressured or in deep darkness, you are in a place of transformation #StartYourImpossible #Growth

Gee I wonder what caused them to fall so far from a nation of boundless wealth from their oil industry.  What ruined it all?

6783 2018-03-04 23:43:15 Not to mention coal and oil are finite! There’s a reason wind and solar are called things like renewable and sustainable.
6784 2018-03-04 23:42:43 Lord Sugar’s original tweet pointed out that you can’t even compete with Spurs so it’s not just oil money that’s the problem.  Arsenal spend more on transfers/wages than Spurs, are 13 points behind, not in the Champs League this season, won’t be next and are out of the FA Cup.

6786 2018-03-04 23:42:32 washing hair in coconut oil 
6787 2018-03-04 23:42:19 thanks to caster oil hahaha angas na ng kilay ko
6788 2018-03-04 23:41:55 Lying in bed, listening to the Doors. I really should oil the hinges.
6789 2018-03-04 23:41:54 Coconut oil is a amazing
6790 2018-03-04 23:41:45 Oil and water dont mix, just like ignorance and intelligence.
6791 2018-03-04 23:41:34 I got oil everywhere trying to oil my hair. Idk what’s going on 
6792 2018-03-04 23:41:22 and I’m FINALLY getting my oil changed...
6793 2018-03-04 23:41:20 We can afford to do without jeans, bourbon, and Harley Davidsons before doing without STEEL AND ALUMINUM. Remember when Russia threatened to cut off Europe's oil? Similar situation if we have weak steel and aluminum industry.
6794 2018-03-04 23:41:09 I have a Ford C-Max. I get a full tank of reg gas about every 12 weeks. Plug in every night. Average about 65 to 85 mpg. It's a '16, haven't needed any service but changed oil twice so far.
6795 2018-03-04 23:40:48 @ChosenFoods I had the hardest time opening a 1 liter bottle of avocado oil I bought at Costco. I don’t remember the last time I struggled to open a container. Can’t you make it easier? I needed my pliers to get it open.
6796 2018-03-04 23:40:35 How do you think I found out I’m supposed to oil his balls? I didn’t just make that up 
6797 2018-03-04 23:40:35 If you are serious about Child Trafficking, then you have to take on the whole Globe. Can we not do that?
Yes, we can. And we will...and we are.
How could Trump's early International Mission around the Globe be so? It wasn't just divying up Oil claims.
6798 2018-03-04 23:40:34 (*｀ω´*)ﾄﾞﾔｱｱ
6799 2018-03-04 23:40:32 Thanks! I might get my oil changed at @jiffylube!
6800 2018-03-04 23:40:25 I fried it in cubes in olive oil with smoked paprika and Himalayan pink salt
6801 2018-03-04 23:40:16 君を笑わせるためなら、僕は尻から油を出すよ。
6802 2018-03-04 23:40:11 made a roux with coconut oil plus one egg today and boy was that weird. delicious but weird.

6804 2018-03-04 23:39:17 Having Alex jones removed from the platform is a public service as far as I'm concerned. Have you seen his snake oil show. Obamas going to take over America with Muslims from Mexico, gov makes frogs gay,Reptilians ect
6805 2018-03-04 23:39:16 Sandy who used the word pawns. Vaughn’s Wed
column showed how organized and secretive opposition is.
It’s also been noticed how much opposition from US
seems aimed at keeping Can oil landlocked.
6806 2018-03-04 23:39:06 Check your labels for palm oil
6807 2018-03-04 23:38:48 Threaten to not build an oil pipeline...
6808 2018-03-04 23:38:44 Oh and I just remembered that during deer hunting season, the leasing of hunting ground is so lucrative, that some ranch owners throw the frac crews off their property for three weeks. They actually make more money off leases than they do off oil and gas royalties for those 3 wks
6809 2018-03-04 23:38:34 I’m having a hard time finding a good Rosehip Oil
6810 2018-03-04 23:38:27 I’m sorry I thought we were looking for Russians not Arabs. Cognac for oil. Maybe we should invest time into uranium rights by the Clintons and Obama. Jeff Sessions go to Sweet Home Alabama !
6811 2018-03-04 23:38:23 The anointing of the Lord is covering like oil
6812 2018-03-04 23:37:58 家の体重計で体内年齢計ったら66歳だったので、もしかしたら年金受給資格あるんじゃね？
6813 2018-03-04 23:37:40 Not too friendly on oil either
6814 2018-03-04 23:37:35 I love Avacado oil. It's legit my favorite cooking oil now.
6815 2018-03-04 23:37:19 It tastes just like it did 20 years ago. It was good in the beginning, but then it kinda petered off. Too much sesame seed oil in the mix.
6816 2018-03-04 23:37:18 ...Hey you can't lose the war when you sell the guns.Your car runs on oil as thick as blood...
6817 2018-03-04 23:36:58 Peppermint oil on your temples or eucalyptus/lavender oil right under your nose.
6818 2018-03-04 23:36:31 Every political leader involved in a war has committed war crimes. George W. Bush's administration pretty much created ISIS by invading the middle east for oil. We use to think he was the stupidest president the US could have, you know. We miss those times.
6819 2018-03-04 23:36:01 No you don’t have to burn them like that, just brown the sides in vegetable oil and cook the insides by returning said balls into sauce. Sauce being 1 can paste 6oz, 2 cans purée 28oz, one can crushed 28 oz, with 16 oz of water, fresh basil, thyme leaf s@p good to go
6820 2018-03-04 23:35:57 #Oil please 
6821 2018-03-04 23:35:53 Need to get this oil change tomorrow smh
6822 2018-03-04 23:35:40 My scalp sooo needed this oil treatment plus it has my hair smelling bomb!
6823 2018-03-04 23:35:35 鍾乳洞だ！
友達と近場の鍾乳洞めぐりしようというので埼玉の鍾乳洞にはいったのですが、その時に「東京にも温泉や鍾乳洞あるんだ！」となりました
もしかしたらそこかな？

東京って八王子が西の端だと思ってたんですが、まだそこから西や北西に広いんですよね…どんな景色が広がってるのか…
6824 2018-03-04 23:35:32 @OrrinHatch also wants Big Oil and Coal to desecrate
Beautiful Utah land and destroy Tourist$$
run big filthy coal trucks, big oil rigs thru small towns-for a few CEO$$
$50 Million (sltrib) set aside in UT State legislative for CA coal port-CA said NO

6832 2018-03-04 23:33:37 Not weed, patchouli. Get your facts straight.

Giuliana said Zandaya looked like she smelled like "Patchouli" which is an aromatic oil obtained from a Southeast Asian shrub in the mint family and used in perfumery.
6833 2018-03-04 23:33:31 Ongc doesnt have license for oil wells...
6834 2018-03-04 23:33:14 US Steel manufacturing supplies 19.4% Our Steel Industry puts America severe disadvantage importing  80.6% needed steel! WHY would we do that? Especially if there’s immediate needed production! War! Oil spike, shortages, How fast transport steel? Lose last foundries? #UShostage
6835 2018-03-04 23:33:13 Lavender oil is heaven sent
6836 2018-03-04 23:33:06 Lordy lordy.  Family of a friend tried to deep-fry a frozen turkey by literally throwing it into a vat of boiling oil.
6837 2018-03-04 23:33:05 ONE HELL OF A POWERFUL COLE BURNER.   THERE IS HUGE SUPPLIES OF CLEAN COAL IN THIS COUNTRY.  WE ARE THE SAUDI ARABIA OF COAL.  WE ARE ALSO MUCH BIGGER THAN RUSSIA OR SAUDI WHEN IT COMES TO CRUDE  OIL..

6839 2018-03-04 23:32:06 The NLRB has almost ZERO authority to stop or halt mistreatment and abuse and of workers as it is.....and you want that further limited?!?!
6840 2018-03-04 23:31:51 American shale oil and gas is fairly new technology. The moment those pipelines are completed Europe should start fracking Poland and France to force Russia to drop price.
6841 2018-03-04 23:31:51 very inspiring
6842 2018-03-04 23:31:42 If you always loose:
A) You can manipulate crude oil down. 
B) You can manipulate currency for your favor.
C) You can keep on laughing at loosers.
6843 2018-03-04 23:31:32 That sound that Denny's car just made as it was peeling out is satisfaction in coconut oil.
6844 2018-03-04 23:31:30 Should I be dressing for  #OscarSunday instead of putting cuticle oil on my toenails?
6845 2018-03-04 23:31:22 @HBChryslerJeep location in Georgia. people make mistakes but not to wanna own up is just messed up I had oil change done and valve cover gaskets fixed. Picked it up drove car half day Check oil and it was empty but they say that didn’t cause motor to go bad.
6846 2018-03-04 23:31:19 I used to think ppl were ripping me off until I went to school and became a technician and realized how much of a piece of shit my car was LMAOOOOOOOOOOOO I changed my oil once in 3 years back then 
6847 2018-03-04 23:31:14 have u tried coconut oil?

6850 2018-03-04 23:30:53 OIL DIFF: 3.06 -> 3.06
6851 2018-03-04 23:30:44 America drills and uses its own oil. It’s called being self-sufficient. Obama was smart to depend far less on foreign oil. Now if only Canada  would do the same.
6852 2018-03-04 23:30:32 Bio oil, himalaya neem mask, pixi lip matte cream no 06
6853 2018-03-04 23:30:29 Stirred kratom in coconut oil and froze overnight. Added hot water just now to dissolve it, added cayenne and ground black pepper, stirred well, then chugged it back with coffee w/ almond/coconut milk. Been testing consumption with lipids and an alkaline stomach environment
6854 2018-03-04 23:30:17 "The result has been spectacular growth in US oil output. The US has overtaken Saudi Arabia as a crude producer, and is on course to pass Russia to become the world leader this year or next."
6855 2018-03-04 23:30:16 I have, *no* opinion on PC. I've kept saying, I have no idea what it is. As far as I can tell it's whatever you don't like. Car leaks oil? PC. Soda went flat? PC.
6856 2018-03-04 23:30:04 OIL DIFF: 2.97 -> 3.2
6857 2018-03-04 23:29:59 If you want to know who started the war, look who won. All you need to know is that the US seized Syria's oil fields less costly than Iraq, ha?
6858 2018-03-04 23:29:58 castor oil helped make my brows thicker, I barely have to fill them now :)
6859 2018-03-04 23:29:45 I just read the article ( if we may call it that) and for the first time ever i was able to in someway understand whats really troublesome about our state run oil company. transparency is important, we should applauded what you just did and at the same time be worried.
6860 2018-03-04 23:28:58 So crazy, I know exactly where that is. We parked there to go to the beach back in August, I remember because of the oil pump! Nutzo!
6861 2018-03-04 23:28:29 2 new tires and oil change 
6862 2018-03-04 23:28:19 That's the problem. They don't use actual facts. They "work" with them. Gotta make those facts agreeable with the snake oil they're selling.
6863 2018-03-04 23:28:16 My son thinks the cream filling in Oreos is coconut oil and puts it in his hair... he now has endless Oreo cream in his hair...
6864 2018-03-04 23:27:59 掛けた時間は褒められたものではないし、先方の信頼は地についてしまったかもしれないけど、とりあえずキーボード叩く速度が戻ってきたのと、PC画面を見ても吐き気が込み上げてくるということはなくなったかも……。
6865 2018-03-04 23:27:40 Then watch a fall should it get to 62.30. Oil can't escape it's reality. WTI had little-to-no business being in the 60s to begin with.
6866 2018-03-04 23:27:39 Everything irritates me and I want to die. Is there an essential oil for that
6867 2018-03-04 23:27:19 I have Said this Over and Over again....and Am still Saying It...This Arsenal FC don't know how to play Football !
    The way they're going down Am sure they'll Soon Discover Crude Oil_

Bhim jorrr
6868 2018-03-04 23:27:14 Smelling like Shea butter and coconut oil 
6869 2018-03-04 23:27:00 Maxine is like the old west snake oil salesman. Claiming to have the cure for everything and the people buy into it for 40 years never getting better but still believing the lies. Millionaire from being a public servant, simply amazing.
6870 2018-03-04 23:26:49 I hope it's that delightful snake oil salesman.  #Hearties
6871 2018-03-04 23:26:20 Oil Kings head to the PK now, the call is hooking.

6875 2018-03-04 23:25:15 Socialism is bad because of Venezuela, just ignore that Bolivia is the fastest growing economy in Latin America with basically the same policies, but not any oil. 
6876 2018-03-04 23:25:01 Oil found at  Haram esh-Sharif ?
6877 2018-03-04 23:24:52 The only currency China is accepting from Venezuela is ... oil. (Because they don't have dollars anyway, while their own currency is worthless).

6884 2018-03-04 23:24:14 Exactly!! We in Utah already have those ugly oil rigs all over (especially in eastern Utah) which are destroying the landscape. That's what they're going to do in those pristine areas. They will never be the same. The fracking, coal mines, oil rigs...not for anything but greed.
6885 2018-03-04 23:24:10 Sad that so many people were so easily manipulated by an obvious dictator wannabe and a snake oil salesman.
6886 2018-03-04 23:24:10 I hate getting oil changes. I really gotta finish learning how to do it myself
6887 2018-03-04 23:24:03 I'm not crying over a cartoon about kids saving animals from an oil spill, you're crying over a cartoon about kids saving animals from an oil spill. Darn you #RustyRivets.

1) Make roux with about 1/4 flour and 2-3 tablespoons of oil. Stir constantly over med-high heat until brown.

2) Stir in small can of tomato paste and small bag of frozen (or fresh) chopped okra. Stir until dark & slimy.

If that is indeed the christmas tree at broadford bridge the I can say without doubt that gas is passing through. What is with it whether it be water or oil I cannot say. All I know is gas under pressure in liquid form is below freezing.
6960 2018-03-04 23:11:38 ok... but why did they change oil of Ulay to Olay?
6961 2018-03-04 23:11:38 I think it's equally likely that Trump is simply talking out of his ass, and if you asked him what the VAT is, he'd say it's where McDonald's keeps their fryer oil.

7058 2018-03-04 22:56:51 Long caution. @nascar yelling at safety workers for missing oil. More speedy dry going down. @T_Mack95 says they might come on one to go for four tires and full fuel.
7059 2018-03-04 22:56:50 I've never made roux with lard, always used veg oil. It did not get brown enough, probably, but the end dish looks and smells pretty good. A blonde #Gumbo I guess.

7062 2018-03-04 22:55:37 Yes! It’s like 25$ bucks .. works great with any oil

7064 2018-03-04 22:54:47 Putin seeks power over the "power." He strives to control all the planet's uranium and oil while doing whatever he can to quash sustainable, environmentally-conscious alternative fuel momentum.
7065 2018-03-04 22:54:40 Water is more important than oil. As the oil industry gets preferential treatment the water available for farmers and ranchers will decline. This of course will result in more disruption until the water is fought over. But you can't change the way politicians operate. Short term.
7066 2018-03-04 22:54:33 so I use castor oil and vitamin e oil to make my lashes and eyebrows thicker and longer but when that shit gets in your eyes it stings like a mf
7067 2018-03-04 22:54:31 And all other oil exporting countries, like Saudi Arabia. He did some business there as well, didn’t he. He’s subtle.
7068 2018-03-04 22:53:53 Im going to assume your anwer is oil. I know B.C stands to gain a whoping 1billion dollars spread out over 20 years from transmountain. How we will ever survive without that is just baffling everyone here.
7069 2018-03-04 22:53:50 Personally I believe the UCP folks will come in and blunder terribly being unable to intelligently set up policy or procedures. Legislation such as REDA needs to be repealed but won't happen. It's a problem with all political parties but mess will continue until the oil is gone.

7091 2018-03-04 22:50:24 U have anythin in mind action wise b side sit back and wait 4 things to unravel at whatever speed? It's all about oil to me

So most of your argument goes back to the individual and the state.

7127 2018-03-04 22:44:36 Definitely should expect that to happen so you expect volatility to decrease as it approaches its steady state value. But should not expect tight stability comparable to a stablecoin. Look at oil for a good comparable—widely adopted, lots of uses, but price fluctuates somewhat.

7150 2018-03-04 22:41:23 IRI, has been able to ship 2,700,000 barrels of oil per day on last few months.
US has a plan to force-reduce this shipment to below 800,000 barrels.
IRI by its present shipment has been able to collect between $50B to $60B per years, only enough to pay the gov.'s salaries.

7152 2018-03-04 22:41:00 The Environmental Protection Administration has fined the owners of an Iranian container vessel 1.5-million N-T for illegally discharging oil into waters off Taiwan's west coast in October of last year.
7153 2018-03-04 22:40:47 Really? I hope you are right. I still think there is a cure out there.Why was such a fuss made about making cbd oil available?
7154 2018-03-04 22:40:30 Today, my 1st ever #Cheesecake.
Making it in #instantpot.

1st instruction “spray springform pan with no stick oil”.

Doh!! 
I sprayed the kitchen window instead! 
Maybe check where it’s aimed 1st I guess?
7155 2018-03-04 22:40:29 You’re talking about demand from Asia...and we’re not going to risk our coast for their demand, foreign oil company profits and Alberta tax revenues.
7156 2018-03-04 22:40:25 With work, I was talking a meeting with the National Oil Company in Tripoli and at the Zawiya refinery. I never got to explore very much which was a shame

7163 2018-03-04 22:39:50 Yup, and buried deep inside,(pg 68?)there are a few lines that give foreign countries and corporations the right to hold majority ownership in Canada! Setting up for the Chinese purchase of Canada’s oil patch? Worth checking into.. and has nothing to do with the actual budget!
7164 2018-03-04 22:39:48 What about ukraine, savistopal naval Base Crimea...where the hell do you think their oil comes from?? Ask tillerson, he made the fucking deal...2012... Black Sea...ring a bell
7165 2018-03-04 22:39:42 See it's like this. The bigwigs and the money creators (oil industry) get priority. The least among us are ignored. This is why Katz Arena problem pushed through by Mandel and the Katz Krew but the problem of homelessness is seen as too diff to solve. @doniveson @Cartmell_Ward9
7166 2018-03-04 22:39:27 The tyrants are waiting thousands of miles away waiting to steal the oil, same as they did in Iraq!

So if NDP can do this, why not do the diversion of cash to the vulnerable or even the debt? Cuz these matters not priority.

7178 2018-03-04 22:38:27 The main thing that will make vegetable  oil smell is overheating it past 190c or putting a lid on when using a deep fryer, the condensation makes the smell a lot worse I think

7185 2018-03-04 22:37:21 Yes, the point being that, on the margin, heavy oil producers are doing better than light oil producers, ceteris paribus (and better than what the consensus might be).
7186 2018-03-04 22:36:56 I can't decide if you're a member of Midnight Oil, or the rapist Forrest Whitaker whacks with a crowbar in Alien 3??
7187 2018-03-04 22:36:51 Absolute spin from the oil industry.  Less than 1 percent of the tar sand are reclaimed.  Canadian are being left with an enormous toxic legacy to clean up.

7190 2018-03-04 22:36:38 Oil prices go up, so does the price of diesel, making truckers charge higher rates. EVERYTHING is transported at some point by truck. EVERYONE will see the price increase. Thanks Little Hands @realDonaldTrump

7194 2018-03-04 22:35:57 No, there are plenty of other more sensible markets for your product that don’t involve oil tankers, risk and our waters. Refining it yourself or shipping south to meet the growing US demand doesn’t need to involve us or shipping to Asia through the Juan de Fuca. #bcpoli
7195 2018-03-04 22:35:20 This is scary shit. What’s next up Putin’s sleeve? Why a war of course with an oil rich nation. The gop will comply, get us involved. This truly sucks

"If after 50 years of independence you have not built the necessary infrastructure for your people, are you humans?

7203 2018-03-04 22:32:55 I hope Canada  retaliates. Tariffs on power and oil we send south.
7204 2018-03-04 22:32:53 Another perspective here is that he actually does know better, but maintains a perspective more convenient to the oil industry.  Odd kind of, as oil too in a way is part of an evolutionary process.  It has taken years, centuries, millennia even to become oil.  A convenient lie!
7205 2018-03-04 22:32:50 Pakora isn’t too bad compared to other deep fried dishes because it fries at a slightly lower temperature - I find frying in a wok filled 1/3 full with oil is easier and less frying smell than using a proper deep fryer
7206 2018-03-04 22:32:35 Thank you. It’s progressing well. Can’t wait to get underway on the bodywork of the car.
7207 2018-03-04 22:32:28 When I did my makeup today I did not expect a stripper with a dick covered in baby oil to flick it all over my face. My sensitive lesbian ass is too gay for this shit

7288 2018-03-04 22:18:26 Red Deer goal at 12:26. 8-6
7289 2018-03-04 22:18:25 Oh really?  Why do you think Russia interfered in our election to put Trump in the White House?  Obama's sanctions were holding up a $500 billion oil deal between Rosneft and Mobil. Flynn discussed lifting those sanctions with Kislyak during the transition.
7290 2018-03-04 22:18:08 Trying this hot oil treatment on my hair , seeing how this going to work out .
7291 2018-03-04 22:17:56 Yes. Wouldn’t the de facto monopoly possessed by these folks be far more monopolistic than Standard Oil and the Bell System?
7292 2018-03-04 22:17:54 こんな日に仕事いくなんて馬鹿だよなぁ
7293 2018-03-04 22:17:37 Tous nos locaux sont à Argenta. Nous n’avons jamais eu de locaux à Raqqa. JAMAIS !

7296 2018-03-04 22:17:05 「よかったですね」
「なにが？」
「全てがですよ」←ここめっちゃすこ
7297 2018-03-04 22:16:57 I believe in every drop of oil that flows a thousand stars,I believe,l believe
7298 2018-03-04 22:16:49 Mmmm.  UK is Eire’s largest market by bulk and equal first (give or take the odd florin) by value.  Eire is significantly less important for UK exporters (5th on the list) and UK controls most of the oil used in The Republic.
7299 2018-03-04 22:16:21 The one guarantee is the oil trains are doubling and grain cars slowing.
7300 2018-03-04 22:16:11 Coconut oil. It’s the best...and it’s edible!
7301 2018-03-04 22:15:57 I've read Yergins The Prize years ago. Texas finds were the ones that proved that oil wasn't a Pennsylvania oddity, if I remember correctly. Giant fields that were depleted too fast because of too many rigs. I like oil, but I also like efficiency. I hate to see it wasted.
7302 2018-03-04 22:15:46 Stir together 9 tsps baked Alaska with 2 tablespoons hot dogs. Sprinkle with Olive Oil. Drain. Serve

7304 2018-03-04 22:15:34 Context - Davita was in bankruptcy in the late 90s. New CEO came in and instituted distributed decision-making. Huge & immediate success. And some very large construction co.s have operated w/out mgrs for decades. Oil could, too.
7305 2018-03-04 22:15:32 "No había escuchado hablar de Singue", peor de Gente Oil, dice @MashiRafael Cínico, aquí estás en Carondelet codeándote con Khalil Boutros, socio de Wilson Pastor y Kabalan Bahij Abisaab Neme.

7306 2018-03-04 22:15:12 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
7307 2018-03-04 22:15:12 So what you're saying is I'm an oil troll payed to do what exactly? What do you think I'm doing with my dim fat ass

7309 2018-03-04 22:15:10 Funny you should scaremonger using the UK as an example, a country with 50 years of oil revenues under its belt, all squandered by governments without the balls to tax Big Oil for the common good. I wish I had your optimism that Canada would be any different.
7310 2018-03-04 22:14:54 If you sit on gold, diamond, oil, manganese, uranium. And your people don't have food, are you humans? Donald Trump
7311 2018-03-04 22:14:43 Coconut oil is the answer to all of your problems
7312 2018-03-04 22:14:37 So many being sucked in to home traps in Colorado. I know people crying in their beer cause their250000 dollar home selling at 160000 a few years ago. How many 750000 homes will drop to225000 or 490000 homes to 275000 when OIL AND GRASS burn out. Lalaland can not last forever.
7313 2018-03-04 22:14:27 put tea trea oil on your man’s cheating habits.
it’ll clear them up in no time
7314 2018-03-04 22:14:08 @BethRigby Why do you roll out chief snake oil salesman Mandelson for his opinion? Who is he?
7315 2018-03-04 22:14:00 What’s so great about hummus?
It’s just bean dip with seasoning.
Like tahini, olive oil, lemon juice and garlic.
Mmm, garlic.
Pass the hummus please.
7316 2018-03-04 22:13:59 Oilers goal snipe from Semeniuk unassisted 16 minutes left in the third. 8-5
7317 2018-03-04 22:13:59 Me neither. But I imagine a handful of big Bruhz with tongz out back talking shit about the best way to prepare the chicken and a pickup truck with a thing of oil for all the peeps they fuck with.
7318 2018-03-04 22:13:55 used some fancy olive oil salt scrub in the shower and now I smell like a straight up french fry— aka: a snack
7319 2018-03-04 22:13:55 Took my car to get an oil change and had someone bring me back to the dorms without my keys. My dorm key is on my keys. Nice. 
7320 2018-03-04 22:13:54 By no means have I ever had a type with men. But as of late I’ve been loving on thirty something old for men covered in tattoos, who put beard oil on their awesome beards, and have children. Lmao idk who I am anymore.
7321 2018-03-04 22:13:44 No point blaming the police, they only follow the instructions given from the Top. Its a eco-system created in democratic system by Jihadis funding elections. QATAR/Saudi spend huge oil money in the Elections, as was openly visible on @HillaryClinton election funds @PamelaGeller

7327 2018-03-04 22:13:19 I have really oily skin normally. Here lately I have been putting baby oil on every night when I get out of the shower and my skin feels and looks so much better.
7328 2018-03-04 22:13:12 Is coconut oil good for ya hair or not ???
7329 2018-03-04 22:13:07 Trump slashed individual and business taxes. He cut the corporate tax rate down from 35% to 21%... a rate not seen in 80 years. He’s slashing regulations faster than any president in U.S. history. The U.S. is becoming energy dominant on oil & natural gas. He also opened up ANWR.
7330 2018-03-04 22:13:05 There was an interesting tweet earlier this week - since the oil money came into the #EPL Arsenal have been left behind. Basically saying unless they spend millions more like city or Chelsea they won't be able to compete #nothisfault

7332 2018-03-04 22:12:40 Lights on! Oil changed in Generator and Stabil added - Yay!
7333 2018-03-04 22:12:36 Sorry sport the US and European oil companies left because of Canada’s & Alberta’s virtue signalling. The   “CO2 is pollution” and “pipelines are bad” idiocy was the reason. There were prices declines many times before 2014 and they stayed for the recovery. They only left Canada
7334 2018-03-04 22:12:27 Another bounce back goal by Red Deer 7-5
7335 2018-03-04 22:12:13 Instead of juuling today id just put hemp oil under my tongue it wad pretty effective
7336 2018-03-04 22:12:11 what about the annual gallons of oil spilling from the pipelines approved by your father that have already leaked hundreds of 1000's of oil into the water supply? 

#NoDAPL ring a bell?
7337 2018-03-04 22:12:00 You'd think that his Secretary of state would have warned him since he from big oil.
7338 2018-03-04 22:11:57 Argon oil products smell like a stink man cologne
7339 2018-03-04 22:11:51 my blankets smell like icy/hot and coconut oil... thank god I live alone.

7342 2018-03-04 22:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza today will be: moist crust with moist motor oil and egg.
7343 2018-03-04 22:10:59 Need to oil my joints again. I swear, sometimes I feel like the tin man from the wizard of oz =A=
7344 2018-03-04 22:10:47 You cannot be a Christian and a Democrat. The two do not mix! Water and oil.
7345 2018-03-04 22:10:34 Agreed. Hope their comeuppance is sooner rather than later.
7346 2018-03-04 22:10:24 In a recent conversation I had with a petroleum engineer at Shell, he told me that, “In 2015, the U.S. produced 567.2 million metric tons and 767.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas. As of 2015, it has the world's ninth-largest oil reserve.”

I'm allergic to coconut, so this coconut oil craze has been a challenge.
7351 2018-03-04 22:10:17 Yes and if you have a good lash technician they won’t ruin your natural lashes. Just don’t use oil based products on your face and they will last 4ever also ask for a lash sealment glue it will make them last longer.
7352 2018-03-04 22:10:11 I need to oil you up.

7354 2018-03-04 22:09:57 Part 2 is more like it though. “I used oil. I cooked myself for you.”
7355 2018-03-04 22:09:39 Does CBD oil work in place of apoquel for dogs? Its for allergies!
7356 2018-03-04 22:09:36 The only people killing Syrians are the US backed mercenaries/proxy armies. US propaganda refers to these terrorists as "moderate rebels". In reality they are not even Syrian but foreign fighters used to capture Syrian oil fields..the real reason the US is in Syria - OIL

7359 2018-03-04 22:09:11 Actually it does, you people would rather float oil in, barge it to Victoria from anywhere else in the world. Shame on Canada for trying to sell the same product. You are full of it

7362 2018-03-04 22:08:34 I love my waterproof better than sex mascara. I love it more because that melt off oil works perfectly with it. 
7363 2018-03-04 22:08:20 No oil. I use 80/20 beef and it has enough fat.
7364 2018-03-04 22:08:10 I am obsessed with my house smelling good, I have 3 oil mist smelly things, 3 scentsys... all of them are always on.
7365 2018-03-04 22:07:47 You are high, on methadone and gun oil.
7366 2018-03-04 22:07:46 we have an oil mix just for this that we bought on amazon. actually can’t find it right now (in real life) which is pretty annoying :)
7367 2018-03-04 22:07:28 Supposing those who leads this country hitherto laid a concrete foundation during the oil boom, just guess what stage of development Nigeria would found itself by now. It could that of "Eldorado "

7369 2018-03-04 22:07:05 That's because you  took 5HTP, melatonin, cannabis oil, breathed in and out through your fucking nose for hours and wanted twice.

7374 2018-03-04 22:06:38 Petro-Dollar is coming to an end. US too blind to see it, still relying on oil to make a living. Even Saudi's eventually woken up they can't rely on oil.
7375 2018-03-04 22:06:35 There's probably a hack for that involving either ice, vinegar, bread soda or coconut oil. One of them seems to solve everything!

7379 2018-03-04 22:05:45 We've had nuclear powered military ships for decades. Nuclear powered container ships and oil tankers would do far more to reduce CO2 emissions than any 'green energy' proposal that I've ever heard.
7380 2018-03-04 22:05:23 Misses from here ! She wanted to move home and I was on oil rigs at time so I was never home
7381 2018-03-04 22:05:21 Wow.....never knew abortion had the much effect. I knew we drilled babies for oil an used them to make powder but damn.

7384 2018-03-04 22:05:04 From a paper that was always against it? What a surprise. When are you going to open your mind? We've had north sea oil for 40 years and now record public debt. Unemployment still never lower than the day we joined. Wages stagnant for 10 years. Trade deficit with EU27. Time to go
7385 2018-03-04 22:04:37 Anyone in Chicago taking art supply donations now? Oil paints, tempera, various papers. @Ag47Collective maybe? Or is it best to put on Craigslist?
7386 2018-03-04 22:04:32 It was sarcastic! During the referendum in 2014 an increase in oil retrieval was painted in a negative light.
7387 2018-03-04 22:04:32 Liberal intl order. Creating an oil and reserve monopoly system in the US dollar and forcing it on the world at military gunpoint.
7388 2018-03-04 22:04:30 i’m not weeping, i’ve just put black castor oil on my eyelids! which if i’m being honest, is probably indicative of a more serious problem

7391 2018-03-04 22:04:07 Buy more of au de parfum and not au de toilette . Au de parfum fragrance is much stronger and lasts longer than toilette . They’re not exactly gender specific . They’re Oil scents vs water scents . Lol

7400 2018-03-04 22:02:23 So on a whim I cut one of the chunks into small medallions and pan-seared them in some oil on a blazing-hot iron skillet until they were super-crispy on the outside but still butter-soft on the inside.

7403 2018-03-04 22:02:00 True. In Jordan my Dad was issued an RJAF Mercedes Benz 200. He often complained that “the oil pan is too low”, but secretly, he later confided that if he’d been allowed to bring it home to the US, he would have.

7413 2018-03-04 22:00:42 Advances in natural gas and bio-fuels may reduce the need for coal in steel production, but as with oil, coal’s value is not yet replaceable.
7414 2018-03-04 22:00:40 I fry lamb or mutton in 2 tsp olive oil & juice of one lemon. 
When lemons get costly, limes taste fine. 
Once the mutton is cooked through, the mixture of oil and juice caramelises around it. OK to add water if pan gets dry, by the time meat is cooked the liquid recaramelises.

7426 2018-03-04 21:59:08 With a few thousand ppl? and if you have to ship oil in, 50 cent /kWhr is cheap in comparison, why the populous on most islands live in 3rd world conditions. St John's, for instance, beautiful resorts, run down buildings the rest of the island, well except the rich who move there
7427 2018-03-04 21:58:44 “My eyes feel tight and squeaky. No matter! I’ll just pour some more oil on them!”
7428 2018-03-04 21:58:29 @jiffylube so, yesterday I went to change my oil to your store guys. And someone of your employers had broken my IPhone screen. How? Because she said your coupon doesn’t work and while I’m trynna taking my phone she left it and has been broken all the screen.
7429 2018-03-04 21:58:24 Imagine a president pushing for solar over oil & nuclear. Imagine an EPA more concerned about environmental safety than private businesses.
7430 2018-03-04 21:58:22 I’ve always liked doing brakes, even drums (mostly). It’s spring oil change season here soon, and a set of plugs for the 335. Good luck!

7435 2018-03-04 21:57:45 Can’t remember where I saw it today, but wasn’t the original plan from the previous operators to drill for gas not oil?
Maybe KL1 has shown something?
7436 2018-03-04 21:57:34 I agree with you 100% but ngl if I was oil I would be doing the same.
7437 2018-03-04 21:57:18 Goodnight. I shall keep the midnight oil burning >_>
7438 2018-03-04 21:57:12 Hey, I welcome all feedback pal, I had a private chat with Malcy about oil and a few stocks. It was interesting and I asked would he like to record it. 

I found it useful for the SDX info alone re fiscal terms. I make no apology for it. I have been clear I'm not paid.

Thanks

J'aime bien Midnight Oil mais de fait, comme aux USA les regrets arrivent qd la messe est dite
7443 2018-03-04 21:56:57 And here in Ga. You can only have the oil at 5% or less. U get it out of state & if you get pulled over w/it the permit allows u to have it.
7444 2018-03-04 21:56:52 An oil changery closed on the weekends. Why for? How come?
7445 2018-03-04 21:56:51 I'm old enough to remember the original Canada US free trade negotiations.  USA wanted and got guaranteed access to Canadian oil.  Canada turned its manufacturing sector upside down.  In exchange, we get never ending bullshit and bullying on lumber.
7446 2018-03-04 21:56:34 Summer of 2012 -- prospering Venezuela, sitting on Earth's largest oil reserves -- outlawed firearms. Within two years, the nation was in economic chaos. In 2017, 87% of Venezuela's population was living below poverty, fighting for toilet paper and eating out of dumpsters.

7453 2018-03-04 21:55:21 Why thank you! I'm due for an oil change!!! 
7454 2018-03-04 21:55:05 @TheRoyGreenShow during the height of the oil and gas prices around 2010 I owned an S class Mercedes that demanded premium and had 100 L tank. It cost $140 to fill but the pumps only authorized up to $80 at a time.
7455 2018-03-04 21:54:40 Scratch that goal. Called off. 6-4 Oilers end of the second. Shots 22-21 Oilers
7456 2018-03-04 21:54:38 Trump loves it. US has no export competition, buys CDN oil for cost and exports it for huge profit which will make it a leader in renewables
7457 2018-03-04 21:54:38 Amen# the Man Of God is on assignment to unlock the oil within you.
7458 2018-03-04 21:54:34 Many government officials get jobs after their terms with the companies they have been voting in favor of. He will likely end up with a 6 figure salary at a gas and oil, or pharma company as a reward for his "good" work.
7459 2018-03-04 21:54:31 where is so i use really i am going oil
7460 2018-03-04 21:54:25 People like this is why I no longer belong to a church or identify with organized religion. Reminds me of #Trump selling snake oil to his idiots.
7461 2018-03-04 21:54:22 i killed the spider truly wiped that binch out of existence and threw peppermint oil everywhere but im still too scared to get in and take that shower supreme leader give me strength
7462 2018-03-04 21:54:20  bruhh if she did not wash her face with holy water and anointing oil let me know...
7463 2018-03-04 21:54:17 off with a shea butter mix, then just coconut oil, and now I use a cupuacu butter mix that Naptural85 (the YT vlogger) did a DIY video on
7464 2018-03-04 21:54:15 So the tea is my skin is SUPAH dry, so I moisturize with some Argan oil mixture i found at TJ Maxx for like four bucks, let that dry a little, and then use the fenty primer. Elf has some good hydrating primers too! Just avoid the silicon based ones
7465 2018-03-04 21:54:06 Blair did well lol oh yeah he was busy killing millions in Iraq for oil to busy to build

7468 2018-03-04 21:53:38 Praise God! Whoever the son SETS free is ,free indeed. Freedom is the indwelling power of setting the captives free from all bondage including mental derision. 

The moment a man that portrays God, faculties his oil as God, is when Romans 9:31-32, and Rom 10:1-4 corrects twists.

7470 2018-03-04 21:53:05 @pepboysauto - Store 1839 is in desperate need of air filters.  Employee stated that the service centers don’t carry them, even though they do oil changes and other services where one would think they carry air filters.
7471 2018-03-04 21:52:54 Oh but you can ship coal to Asia from Tsawwassen at the rate 2.7 Million Boe Equivalence.... need I remind you it’s US coal for the most part !..in fact Van is expanding ports to export even more coal ..and for the record the US ships more oil through Canadian waters than Canada
7472 2018-03-04 21:52:46 Jamaican Black Castor oil (if you want to boost your leave in, you can add aloe Vera juice, Castor oil and jojoba oil). And then finally I'd say you need a butter/ oil to seal. There are so many to choose from and it's really just down to what you and your hair like. I started
7473 2018-03-04 21:52:45 En que momento mi mente decidió que me vuelva caminando sola del fuel oil, en un momento estaba en el baile y en el otro estaba volviendo a casa 
7474 2018-03-04 21:52:30 私自身の思想から穿った見方を共産党に対してしてますが、

経済がいい方向に回ってればとりあえず維持をしたいと考えるのが普通ですよねたぶん。

粛清規制をしてる話しか聞かないので反発勢力もあるのでしょうけど、そこらへんにほんとに感じなんですかねー。

7476 2018-03-04 21:51:49 Maine is using it as a pretext to deny expensive services to severely autistic people if their guardians give them cannabis oil under a doctor's supervision.

7483 2018-03-04 21:50:51 Victoria is upgrading that situation just like any municipality is anywhere across Canada as antiquated systems are being modernized. That argument isn’t going to sell oil tankers and oil spills.
7484 2018-03-04 21:50:49 Yeah, the part I hate is only the part where at some point it's not sustainable? We hit "peak oil" on a lot of these models quickly in a rush to flood the service with more content than audiences can consume, and soon EVERYONE has a service and they all want 7.99 a month
7485 2018-03-04 21:50:42 Well babs I have you known essential lavender oil when in holiday is key for my mozzy bites , standard rub on the legs prior to snooze 
7486 2018-03-04 21:50:31 Isn't that one reason why they are cutting down precious rain forest, so they can plant palm oil trees to satisfy our desire for sweet treats tragic to say the least it's extremely worrying
7487 2018-03-04 21:50:27 Well, overpopulation *can* cause mass starvation and genocide is my point. It's in our best interest to avoid that sort of thing, but until we find an alternative to oil or somehow bring prosperity to the poorest countries, our massive population worldwide remains a valid concern

7501 2018-03-04 21:49:01 Yes, I did. I'm back in the UK after living in Spain, currently in Liverpool. Orodeal and Kirkcaldy both sound familiar.
7502 2018-03-04 21:48:52 Oil & smash..
7503 2018-03-04 21:48:42 Being cheap and lazy is going to kill me...I won't order becoz money and I don't really have the energy to make overcooked rice or eggs without oil (my only two options), but I could also just sleep
7504 2018-03-04 21:48:34 You haven't lived till you've had a roast with proper Yorkshire pudding that's been cooked in the pan juices. People make Yorkshire pudding with cooking oil now, so it's bland & terrible.
7505 2018-03-04 21:48:34 i get rly dry patches so i use the mario badescu oil free moisturizer and the nivea cream moisturizer and also japonesque velvet touch primer for my pored

7507 2018-03-04 21:48:24 Yes theres copper, gold, diamonds, cobalt, uranium, oil, and coltan. Coltan is like vibranium. It’s used in cell phones, planes, etc but only found in Congo
7508 2018-03-04 21:48:16 Most of the raw materials and resources including oil and power come from Canada so it would NOT be a wise decision to impose tariffs. We can cut power, oil, and iron ore. Not good for USA. Be smart with your allies.
7509 2018-03-04 21:48:15 We need to go back to 9/11 and to the sequence of false flags, for which CIA, USA 
they have with OP Gladio B, first Alqaeda and after the IS puppets.
In the middle there are some wars,
Afghanistan (oppium) Iraq (oil & gold) Libya (idem) destabilizing the whole MO and Siria after
7510 2018-03-04 21:48:14 Ah ok thank you very much. Had no idea, have heard of Peak Oil and the oil crisis in 1973 but not in that way unfortunately. Anyway very interesting.
7511 2018-03-04 21:47:56 Oh, they have to ship oil in to run generators, they get cheaper power, it's just still 5 or 6 times the 7 cents/kWhr I pay for generation. 
High energy prices are very regressive. Hurting the poor the most. World bank won't loan poor countries money to build coal power stations

7516 2018-03-04 21:47:45 He’s well paid by the oil and gas industry. They don’t care what he believes so long as he does their bidding.
7517 2018-03-04 21:47:35 It depends :) Rigid hierarchies shud go.  But the nature of hierarchy is determined by the context.  Oil company cannot operate like a tech startup.  Even within a product lifecycle, a turnaround situation calls for less democratic structure than a new product scenario.

7521 2018-03-04 21:47:21 Not so sure even medium/long term prospects for refineries adding capacity to handle LTO are that rosy given uncertainty of supply on 1)high depletion rates of current fields-only Permian is above previous peak;2)very low EROI of shale oil;3)negative E&P's FCF and high debt.
7522 2018-03-04 21:47:01 can i moist you guys in with oil. CAN I BE UR OIL LADY OMG

7524 2018-03-04 21:46:31 Oil made Norway one of the richest countries in the world. In fact most of the richest countries in the world have oil, except Scotland where we have oil and a UK that controls said oil. Where do you think the problem lies? #ScotRef

7530 2018-03-04 21:46:08 It’s not about a disruption, it’s about saying no to this for the exact same reasons as Norther Gateway, the environmental risk and economic consequences are much bigger than the benefits of shipping oil to Asia through these waters.
7531 2018-03-04 21:46:02 Careful, that oil of Bergamot is potent stuff. I used to bathe with it. Gave me a frightful sunburn some days.

7543 2018-03-04 21:44:38 Are you actually implying that oil sands production increases are that elastic? There’s some brownfield projects that will go ahead if prices get very high but not much. Greenfield would come online many years from now.

7545 2018-03-04 21:44:26 Jealousy for what. I would never take pep at my club and rate pochettino higher. How is that jealousy ? I can sense how it must have been, you were the irrelevant club in Manchester and now with oil money you are winning trophies.
7546 2018-03-04 21:44:09 Oh yes. Bring my boobs in to imply I don’t have a brain. 

You must not understand your own tweet of Obama being an oil salesman, if you are unable to understand my reply.
7547 2018-03-04 21:44:08 This is rosin oil - it's just squished with heat and pressure and this solventless extract is the result

7556 2018-03-04 21:42:49 Ima bout to murder a loaf of crusty french bread by ripping it apart and drowning it in olive oil ..Fuck yeah..

7559 2018-03-04 21:42:28 omg my aunt put some weird oil on me from like bethlehem and it smells like religion
7560 2018-03-04 21:42:12 lol. You're an angry wee fan of a fake wee club funded by oil. I know exactly what an away allocation is and a home allocation. Much easier to fill a paltry 3000 seats than 60,000 ya fucking super nugget
7561 2018-03-04 21:42:11 Oilers goal Harding in front from Amyotte. 7:30 left in the second. 6-3 Oilers
7562 2018-03-04 21:41:37 Mines are shit too. I take multi vits and iron tablets now. Also I’ve stopped putting any polish or treatments on and just using loads of nail oil.
7563 2018-03-04 21:41:34 Looking for oil stock look at the auctions it fluctuates that's why Putin sold to gas lngs to new England last month mixed with French oil . Cute way to avoid sanctions
7564 2018-03-04 21:41:30 Same here about 500
Big whoop!
7565 2018-03-04 21:41:23 Black seed oil wasn’t as bad as I had imagined it to be. Adding it to my daily diet. #MoorRichEmpire™ #LONGLIVEDRSEBI

7567 2018-03-04 21:41:22 Use olive oil to take them off ! It’s less painful
7568 2018-03-04 21:40:52 Do you even read what I type? Again oil powered cars have 30% efficiency. What happens with the rest noone cares.
7569 2018-03-04 21:40:40 I had to re-follow & re-follow & re-follow a number of ppl too within minutes too. Took lots of extra time to see that they 'stuck' as followed. They are making us spin our wheels on wasted motions to keep us from being connected & from tweeting our messages.
7570 2018-03-04 21:40:38 I’m in love with this Too Faced coconut oil. It bronzes & makes my skin glow 
7571 2018-03-04 21:40:30 So @Midas has a pompus CEO that likes to spend money on frivolous things and mechanics that can't properly attach a sign to a plane... but it's ok, they'll rotate your tires for free with an oil change! Hopefully all the lugs are tight.
7572 2018-03-04 21:40:21 I am only talking about 1mbpd over the next 12m. Seems manageable. Also if we stay at these prices we have plenty of oil sands to balance US
7573 2018-03-04 21:40:15 We're about the be the largest oil producing country in the world, while simultaneously lessening our own usage of fossil fuels.

Whenever Russia finally capitulates and gets rid of that effective psychopath of theirs, the 1% will give you a tiny pittance and life'll be sweet. :)
7574 2018-03-04 21:40:15 サラダ油って体に悪いんですか？サラダなのに？
7575 2018-03-04 21:40:08 Lol, well said! I think many r just waiting for Dahlin now. Oil should be good again in 4yrs. Start @ 25% & add 25% yearly. #Lostintrestfor2018
7576 2018-03-04 21:40:04 Yup. Just like their house cleaners being illegal Latinos. So that means all illegals are good and should stay. Just like their next door neighbor being an arab oil tycoon so All muslims are good ppl not terrorists.

7578 2018-03-04 21:39:47 This is basically Hemp oil and of no benefit to your health! Not worth the 9.49 they are charging for it! Very good article though!  #EndOurPain #MedicalCannabis #AlfiesHope

7583 2018-03-04 21:39:16 Lemon essential oil smells so good
7584 2018-03-04 21:38:58 I use mine almost every day! A few tweaks (usually less oil) but loving it. Have fun!
7585 2018-03-04 21:38:53 Do u not bathe in motor oil?
7586 2018-03-04 21:38:51 What I read was Qatar group put up money Glencore and Italy banks put up the most . This was Putin asking for a loan to help his country 19.5 but the .5 is gone ( finders fee ? ) and that is about half a billion . It was in a oil blog . Putin sold 19.5
7587 2018-03-04 21:38:42 Night night Val Had oil today and heating is working at last.A lovely relaxing day xx
7588 2018-03-04 21:38:28 Wow what beard oil have you been using? Impressive growth.

7595 2018-03-04 21:36:19 Hey, if you have any questions, you can always holler here.

(Also, palm oil doesn't have any standout smell. If it does, it's probably bad palm oil. Same goes for 90% of Nigerian oils. I'd suggest you go for something else entirely).
7596 2018-03-04 21:36:02 Why don't you investigate the US money involved in Can election and anti oil demonstrations ?
7597 2018-03-04 21:35:47 Je ne serai pas contre une enquête sur l’alliance AVC , les malversations , les matchs arrangés , l’implication de @afpfr
7598 2018-03-04 21:35:47 ah yeah that should be able to be fixed with the oil

7604 2018-03-04 21:35:17 Maybe it’s the cannabis-infused olive oil talking, but every time I see your Twitter handle, I think ‘Amber R Muffin’. And then I get hungry for an egg McMuffin. And then I realize McDs is all day breakfast and uber eats delivers, so I’m good.
7605 2018-03-04 21:35:16 Ohh I haven’t tried Pantene Gold X I use eco styler jel, curl enhancing smoothie and coconut oil x
7606 2018-03-04 21:35:07 Who sells original authentic coconut oil on this app?
7607 2018-03-04 21:34:54 The case of this "across the federation" is what brings suspicion. Why must the loan be given to herders? Why not palm oil producers or snail farmers? Let everything about this cattle grazing be limited to the North.... 

The South can always sort themselves out. 

@Amaka_Ekwo
7608 2018-03-04 21:34:50 What a well thought out response,having never met me.
Iv actually been to Saudi Arabia 13 times, working in the oil industry. The human rights in this country is absolutely disgusting.This shithole i live in? Will that be London?or the Philippines?What the fuck have u ever done?
7609 2018-03-04 21:34:40 America has no business in the Middle East except that some rich fuckers want the oil that we don't even really need.
7610 2018-03-04 21:34:40 Just been working. Oil field shit be having me with no signal like 60% of the time. Sprint ain’t built for this shit.

7619 2018-03-04 21:33:16 Baby steps, Stumpy, baby steps. ;0) Can you imagine if you Alberta actually decided to engage Vancouver and have  serious conversation about the oil sands, pipelines, and tankers? FYI - I'd do that in a heartbeat.
7620 2018-03-04 21:33:05 Ohh I’ll have to try those products  I use eco styler jel, with curl enhancing smoothie and coconut oil. I love using my conditioners to enhance my curls even more x

7627 2018-03-04 21:31:49 When the US started producing shale oil Putin & Saudis (rivals) talked it through and sorted out  a plan. Now China produces too much steel and Trump attacks anyone but China
7628 2018-03-04 21:31:47 Brilliant! Oil on troubled waters... . Thank you!
7629 2018-03-04 21:31:46 I'm no currency expert, but my cryptography snake oil/bs detector is well honed. I'd point you to a few threads, but you'd gouge your eyes out.
7630 2018-03-04 21:31:43 Its hard for some to accept that coaches need to find a way with the assets given them.  When’s the last time coach threw a waterbottle or a stick?  He doesn’t even change his tone.  Others do it to keep their jobs. #mustbewellplaced
7631 2018-03-04 21:31:33 Damn :/ I know using a more natural lye soap will help with oil too. I stay awayyyyy from neutrogena and those commercial brands because they’re too harsh and the chemicals scare me lol but good luck finding something right for your skin!!! I know how hard it can be

7635 2018-03-04 21:31:01 Do they use "creation geology" for finding oil reserves o the usual long age geology?
7636 2018-03-04 21:30:50 witch hazel or tea tree oil as a toner, cerave is an amazing moisturizer!! the body shop’s tea tree clay masks are great, and st ives apricot or green tea facial exfoliators are lifesavers!!

7639 2018-03-04 21:30:35 The internet is a constant source of disinformation. Can't build no wind turbine without no petrol. However  I want the oil price as high as 500$
7640 2018-03-04 21:30:34 Ha I just ate half a bag. How to make kale taste better is to "massage" olive oil into it. squish it really hard in your fist, pretty much to the point of it wilting. it really takes away the bitter taste as if you just pour it on a little bit, the bitterness is still there
7641 2018-03-04 21:30:17 Like a vampire, he drinks oil out of robots.
7642 2018-03-04 21:30:17 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。

Deut 7:13
7644 2018-03-04 21:30:05 Coconut oil really is the goat
7645 2018-03-04 21:29:45 I love the Olive Oil shampoo. I use it and then follow it up with the ACV rinse and air dry. I rarely use conditioner and between those two my hair and scalp are never dry. But you should try lots of products. It’s fun with a short cut to test stuff out.
7646 2018-03-04 21:29:25 Waiting while your oil gets changed is the adult equivalent of...there are no equivalents, this is just boring.
7647 2018-03-04 21:28:56 Go to a public hospital sunday evening u will see not let than five men burnt with hot water with sugar and cooking oil. Watch doctors remove their clothes that have stuck to the burn wounds. They be burnt by their women. Today's woman is powerfull and dont want to be played
7648 2018-03-04 21:28:40 I would expect that the low oil and natural gas prices coupled with the obstacles to building new pipelines are the biggest road blocks to foreign investment in Canada.
7649 2018-03-04 21:28:31 For times mostly I'm afraid. Owen thought show at Richmond '95 Truck race was best he had seen until topped by a Texas pre show where Eddie Gossage in 10-gallon hat jumped into flaming pit of oil or something! Just kidding. Frankly, I was usually too busy to watch pre-race shows.
7650 2018-03-04 21:28:16 my favorite treat when i have a cold is the sapporo ichiban miso ramen with peanut butter stirred in, i also did some peas/sesame seeds/sesame oil/chili flakes because that's what I had, baked tofu/scallions/corn/spinach/mushrooms all work too

7652 2018-03-04 21:27:48 If you run a small business with a couple of staff and the business has taken in nothing owing to staff absence - unavoidable but absence nonetheless - where does the money come from to pay them? Small businesses are not oil companies or public bodies

7656 2018-03-04 21:27:31 Yes I remember. Did you not also visit the UK previously with your olive oil documentary?
7657 2018-03-04 21:27:14 Lucic has 6.5 million reasons not to lose weight, compete or even give a sh*t. And you’re wasting your time with #97, he’s fast, he has moves but he’s predictable. What would life be if the Oil still had Petry, Dubnyk, Hall, Eberle... great Management! Go Jets and Leafs!Lol
7658 2018-03-04 21:27:00 Are they going to run into any oil rigs during the race ?
7659 2018-03-04 21:26:50 So take the word oil... and replace it with the word... while... try to use some human intelligence or rent some for the day....
7660 2018-03-04 21:26:39 Cant wait for uni. Accidentally got boiling hot vegetable oil all over the kitchen bench and floor, dunno why i  didnt take into consideration that it would probably melt through a plastic container lol !
7661 2018-03-04 21:26:29 So hardline our peodcts. Oil, natural gas, water, everything they get cheap.
7662 2018-03-04 21:26:24 To producing 105mbpd but now you need to produce 10mbpd of petchem, 40mbpd of gasoline, 45mbpd of middle distillate and 10mbpd of everything else, it means that you need a crude that will produce that 5mbpd of middle distillates. 5mbpd of Shale oil will not do that

7671 2018-03-04 21:25:31 How do you feel about using virgin olive oil vs regular and the issue with low smoke point on the virgin oil?
7672 2018-03-04 21:25:24 I agree with you, maybe we all should start tweeting trump about it and his people will do something? It only hurts him & other cons
7673 2018-03-04 21:25:24 I am aware, I've tried all the tricks in the past, even pouring warm oil into my ear to melt/break down the wax build up but even that didn't work. I really need to get around to getting it professionally done but i am a poor and lazy artist~
7674 2018-03-04 21:25:23 Yesterday we broke a big jar of coconut oil. Just sliced my  heel open wide on a piece i missed :( And i have no coconut oil. Sad day

7680 2018-03-04 21:24:43 Why should tax dollars go towards this.  It’s the oil companies who are making the money.  They should have to provide a fully funded 24/7 response force before one drop is shipped.
7681 2018-03-04 21:24:43 We should base our analysis on the number of years he has spent. The way it was before. Foreign reserve, food dependency, non oil revenue and oil price globally. He met a rotten food. He is trying to microwave it. No politician is a magician. It's needs time.
7682 2018-03-04 21:24:24 And oil too

7685 2018-03-04 21:23:53 OMFG WHY DOES BLACK SEED OIL TASTE SO BAD! 
7686 2018-03-04 21:23:44 That can't be true.  The oil lobby controls Republicans.
7687 2018-03-04 21:23:31 Just spent all morning playing with watercolors and experimenting with using frisket/masking fluid. But I am also reminded of the fact that I am a *very* impatient painter. At least watercolor dries much quicker than oil paint! I may stick with it yet.
7688 2018-03-04 21:23:19 You sir, Mr. Weber just fell from a turnip truck. These tariffs will hit you directly in the wallet with hikes on everything from food to cars to appliances to gas & oil. Good luck, genius. There goes your big wage hike from the tax Scam!

7690 2018-03-04 21:22:48 She's hard of hearing. Utahn's driving out of state. The attendant, "fill it up?" Yes.."what'd he say!!?" He's gonna fill the tank. "Check the oil?" Yes. "What'd he say!!?"...."I see you're from Utah, worst piece of ass I ever got was from Utah." "What?" He thinks he knows ya!
7691 2018-03-04 21:22:38 Then the oil cartel was not cutting oil production
7692 2018-03-04 21:22:38 Made my own coconut oil 
7693 2018-03-04 21:22:34 Asked my child to go to the shop to purchase extra EXTRA virgin olive oil to help me get my fake tan off. He walks upstairs with ‘Crisp n Dry’ 
7694 2018-03-04 21:22:23 The filthy rich people here mostly stole government money. Got shady government contracts or some sort of govt established monopoly. Oh and oil wells by faith too. I don't know what problems they solved sha.
7695 2018-03-04 21:22:18 Good thing my stock in Whale Oil is still strong?
7696 2018-03-04 21:22:16 No, my claims to be a medic and to have worked in Algera for an oil and gas company for 2 years are true. In true typical hack style, you spun it into "mercenary killer". Interesting
7697 2018-03-04 21:21:33 Do u remember how excited K-bomb was to be back healthy this year. His play and the teams play andthe Oiler’s karma shit sandwich have reduced him to look how I feel about the team.
7698 2018-03-04 21:21:32 You literally told me you needed a trans cooler and an oil cooler you piece of shit
7699 2018-03-04 21:21:23 Don't dm me and/or apply directly here: An oil painting fueled by cryptocurrency 2.
7700 2018-03-04 21:21:18 If they didn't lie about all the other stuff your oil would mysteriously be way overdue for changing.
7701 2018-03-04 21:21:10 In Finland we don't have oil, so we produce this thing called debt instead. Almost as effective in fueling the economy, and with none of the climate issues of oil.
7702 2018-03-04 21:21:07 I’m sure that new organic beard oil rub just goes great on a brisket
7703 2018-03-04 21:21:02 Venezuela publishes oil over a boil; reduce heat.

Regardless of the flag upon it's soil #Americon
7706 2018-03-04 21:20:41 Solid article Allan.

Deferred hope does indeed make the heart sick!

Last Spring was more fun than city has had in looooong time.

On heels of that, massive unmet expectations cut real deep!

BUT all is not lost, there is “much” about Oil to be optimistic about.

I choose that.
7707 2018-03-04 21:20:40 I've heard some complaints about having a "boring" salad. Its up to you to spice it up. And no.not by drowning it in high fat dressing. Add cranberries, grapes, cuties (oranges), tomato. Also use a oil and vinegar dressing. Its healthy and will really make the salad pop.
7708 2018-03-04 21:20:30 [comms brainstorm] don't laugh, but my grappling hook is jammed and i'm stuck hanging over the oil reservoir, please help
7709 2018-03-04 21:20:30 Don’t forget the expertise that the US sent in the 70s to build their oil refineries.
7710 2018-03-04 21:20:20 I’ve had a Valvoline do that too..... too bad for them I check my shit and only took it in for my oil change bc I get lazy... lol

7714 2018-03-04 21:19:21 Went to buy a beard wash, oil and balm. The cashier told me the amount after tax and I was like oh gosh all this money. You know it processed without me inserting my card? Can’t tell me there isn’t a God.
7715 2018-03-04 21:19:20 Im dead ass too . Ill get oil and everything lmao this is not a game
7716 2018-03-04 21:19:15 Urgently need a garage to fix a timing chain gasket oil leak on our car tomorrow. Anywhere near #bownessonwindermere #LakeDistrict. Will be ringing around places tomorrow. Tweeted here just in case. Thanks.
7717 2018-03-04 21:19:09 In the end gas will be needed though as complement to renewables. Oil and gas are 2 different animals, can't put them in the same box
7718 2018-03-04 21:19:06 Try essential oils in an oil burner. Best value for money.
7719 2018-03-04 21:19:00 I remember the Girl Scout cookie orangutan palm oil controversy

7729 2018-03-04 21:17:21 Texas is super wealthy. Lots of oil money. Strip clubs are very prosperous. Vegas is also a good place for entertainers. Suoer cheap living and you can get a 3 bedroom brand new house for $1200 a month pool and all.
7730 2018-03-04 21:17:19 AIGHT coconut oil is THE shit how do you think my hair is growing at the rapid pace of 1cm every month
7731 2018-03-04 21:17:04 Mrs. Long doesn't believe everything you see written on paper. Much less if it comes from PREPA. That million-dollar item of electric power theft can be a zafacon account to hide the corruption of the oil cartel, fishing contracts, #Pay4Play, and other rattles.
7732 2018-03-04 21:16:38 Because I want to release oil

7735 2018-03-04 21:15:43 KRG news channels in a nutshell:
Kurds are in fact less than 2nd citizens in Iraq but as KRG, we will make sure to keep Iraq united. 
Even if money rains, we can't pay salaries. Soon it will get much worse. Also, we have no idea where all that oil revenue goes.
(Deal with that)
7736 2018-03-04 21:15:33 Let's be honest: we can't catch Manchester City next season just doing 2/3 signings. Guardiola failed in his first season in England and he broke the market with the oil money last summer.

We MUST do the same and break the market next summer if we want to win Premier League 2019
7737 2018-03-04 21:14:51 I have acsneaking suspicion that the green Fosters Bitter oil can available across US is actually VB. It has that Amber colour to it, and tastes totally different to the blue label Fosters lager
7738 2018-03-04 21:14:47 No unauthorized text messages have been received today, That makes it a good day and I need some oil, 5w30 will do.
7739 2018-03-04 21:14:31 Oh, the ingredient I'm allergic to is coconut and all the derivatives. I've had people try to convince me that I'm making it up because when they refine the oil, it stops being allergenic or some nonsense. But yeah, if only I just detoxed my hair longer perhaps!!!
7740 2018-03-04 21:14:26 The gap is only there since the Oil Money came to the City!!
7741 2018-03-04 21:14:25 You’ll never succeed in appealing to trump’s base because words like “progress” “future” “technology” and “transitioning” are long whereas “coal” “oil” “past” and “old” are short. 
7742 2018-03-04 21:14:23 #UKOG - Oil - the tweet must have been signed off by the man himself. Could they have had a Eureka moment since friday? He does not like social media so it is surprising to see a heads up on a Sunday evening whilst watching churchill
7743 2018-03-04 21:14:16 Such a great gift for your friend! I've had more Nat 20s with my oil slicks than any other dice. I don't go to any dnd game without them.

She loves him deeply but their like water and oil
Sometimes she wishes she didn't sometimes over-boil
She and him, so much alike,

7746 2018-03-04 21:13:48 Must confess, I do use veg oil but no butter. Can't use butter when cooking for someone who has a dairy free diet.

Arguably fastest top line in the league Aberg only winger able to keep, RNH with McD, Drai paid to C 2nd & Looch gets easier comp on 3rd
7748 2018-03-04 21:13:43 Palestine was a creation of us Brits actually. The whole Middle East was divided up in terms of strategic importance. Palestine got forgotten about because they have no Oil.
7749 2018-03-04 21:13:36 I had seen CO2 blasting done on turbine bearing to remove burned oil. The big plus of CO2 blasting is it is 'non abrasive' and did not leave contamination. But honestly I have no idea of the price for 'small' part.
7750 2018-03-04 21:13:31 Roast it in the oven!! Set the oven on 425, drizzle with olive oil and kosher salt, cook for 20-25 min. When it’s done aqueeze some lemon juice on it. Soooo good!
7751 2018-03-04 21:13:17 Was always unsure about it, but now I really want to learn how to oil paint
7752 2018-03-04 21:13:09 today was my breaking point. my mom ordered me cbd oil, i’m making an appointment for a psychologist and I’m starting therapy... here’s to finally manning the fuck up and getting help. 
7753 2018-03-04 21:13:03 i used to massage my ears with jojoba oil (idk if that did much) but i think downsizing is what fixed it
7754 2018-03-04 21:12:36 I thought this chat has been postponed
7755 2018-03-04 21:12:16 The current mix of crude oil produces current product mix. Refineries cannot change that mix much. Future product mix is expected to be heavier. This requires new crude production to produce significantly more heavy product to acheive. That is impossible with lighter feedstock
7756 2018-03-04 21:12:10 Mmmm! I can smell the truffle oil from here

7759 2018-03-04 21:11:43 I am assuming the protest industry isn't made up of Canadians as any Cdn protesting Cdn oil is an absolute idiot as that is the main source of money paying their welfare/unemployment while they protest instead of work for a living. #cdnpoli
7760 2018-03-04 21:11:25 I use straight cbd pills/oil, meditate, and read. I know it doesn’t work for everyone but it helps me and I used to have panic attacks almost daily
7761 2018-03-04 21:11:25 Craig do you really think Westminster takes nothing from Scotland yet pays 10BN PER YEAR for Scotland
Are there any other countries with huge oil and gas reserves Westminster has helped out n this way?

7764 2018-03-04 21:10:59 I am not from an oil producing state, but I will join this fight if nothing is done before "our" time.
7765 2018-03-04 21:10:25 Well that may be but it would still seem u r lying about being a medic and working as a mercenary in Algeria on behalf of oil companies.

7774 2018-03-04 21:10:02 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
7775 2018-03-04 21:09:47 I recall how warm & soft boobs were. Sexy, exciting. Comfy & cozy, wonderful with oil.

Are they still like that?
7776 2018-03-04 21:09:22 And you apparently claim to have killed people w an AK for the oil industry...... Stay woke
7777 2018-03-04 21:09:14 (2) really on board with his advocating war crimes, e.g. killing terrorists' families, bringing back waterboarding "and worse," and stealing countries' oil? Did they perceive him as knowledgeable in economics and foreign policy when he suggested that we should default on US ...
7778 2018-03-04 21:09:07 That must go back to . Arizona and New Mexico. The brake in the territory.. then the George Bush oil spill in Texas.. then the . FBI has only so about of people. . So where is it when the FBI hands off to military. When the recruiting office went out the back door?.

7784 2018-03-04 21:08:05 100,000 children in the Niger Delta died in their first month of birth between 2012 and 2018 because of oil spills that occurred prior to their conception. All these for 13%. This arrangement, cannot continue.
7785 2018-03-04 21:07:59 Are you asking me or telling me it was funded entirely by the Scottish government? I know Norway’s tunnel wasn’t paid by their oil fund, your article told me that. So as you state if Scotland had more resource(road or bridge tolls) than Norway we could also build a tunnel.
7786 2018-03-04 21:07:40 So now your no longer a UK Medic, or an Algerian cop, but an oil mercenary? Why did u use an AK as an oil mercenary? If I'm being honest this sounds like a bunch of lies that snowballed because u didn't expect anyone to hold u accountable for the claims u r making

7788 2018-03-04 21:07:23 No, this about increasing the flow so it can be shipped by oil tanker to Asia though our waters and at our risk. About increasing profits and tax revenue, not about the existing flow to Westridge and WA.
7789 2018-03-04 21:07:10 You can wear heavy eye makeup, get in the water, use oil based products, sit in a sauna, EVERYTHING without having to be super careful! they’re your natural lashes but it works just like a hair perm so it’s way more liberating than extensions IMO!

7827 2018-03-04 21:01:26 What about one without palm oil ("sustainable" or otherwise)? I've found even @SumaWholefoods disappoints there.

Why would you be shocked.
The USA blew up the Middle East and triggered isis and Syria and all the other crap because of oil

7831 2018-03-04 21:00:49 Is that not a kind of cattle colony?  Is it not bring managed by the Fulanis? Will they ever leave there? Won't they start breeding there? Won't they claim that their forefathers gave it to them like they claim the oil today? Or is there something I don't still know about it?
7832 2018-03-04 21:00:40 To listen to them talk about how we should have taken the oil and how much money is in Social Security, trump sounds like he wants to get his grubby little hands on all our money.

7834 2018-03-04 21:00:34 I think Daz the plum has confused wishing for something with actual real events. I see this a lot at the moment, usually ends with "WHEN THE OIL RUNS OUT" or something
7835 2018-03-04 21:00:29 Get some clove oil, stinks and tastes awful but it's really good.  Rub it on the gum around the tooth and it will numb the area

7838 2018-03-04 21:00:14 @FoodNetwork your recipe for funnel cakes suck. My son in law is a chef, him and I Dothan tried to make those funnel cakes and each time, they burnt as soon as you poor the batter into the oil. Plus you have many bad reviews.

7849 2018-03-04 20:57:45 Yes let’s cripple ourselves while others reap the benefits of our stupidity. Most of the groups that oppose the oil industry are the ones with their hands out. How the hell do you think we pay for our social programs.

7854 2018-03-04 20:56:40 That's why its so important to invest in other industries countrywide. Exports like steel, asbestos, oil - not fancy or lavish sectors but they bring jobs and are not dependent on individual foreign investment. The regulation of these industries needs to be done carefully
7855 2018-03-04 20:56:21 @JeffBezos so you own the book market, you own the e-commerce environment, when are you going to own the power generation market?

When you apply wax, it goes exactly where you put it...down the middle and inside the links when worked in. Which is all you need for protection 1/3

7946 2018-03-04 20:43:30 Funny thing was though, our sanctions on Russia's oil industry backfired and we did more damage to our own oil industry than theirs.

7952 2018-03-04 20:42:58 I’m no skin expert, but I’d suggest Exfoliate & Cleanse then use a face cream that’s packed full of essential vitamins before bed. Then on those days where your skin is particularly dry, try using a facial oil then go in with a light foundation so not to irritate your skin. 
7953 2018-03-04 20:42:52 We don’t produce fish, the sea does. China and Russia produce cheaper oil/gas/steel, we buy our our latest military planes from the USA. We don’t have an active aircraft carrier that uses planes. Most cars that are part built here are owned by foreign companies.

And trying to Take over Syria so the Saudis can build their oil pipeline to Europe.

7960 2018-03-04 20:40:41 In the early 80’s I personally watched as major oil companies directed drilling rigs to stop drilling 5’ above zone. IOW’s 5’ from hitting an abundant source of crude. Many times they would skid the rig 10-20’ & start a new hole, and repeat the process.
7961 2018-03-04 20:40:32 Never thought the oil thing was real apart from Cheney Feith neocons trying to sell it. Iraq invasion was bs. Never altruistic mission.

7966 2018-03-04 20:39:57 It took me some time to get it right. Made an olive oil base with S/P, soy, cumin, crushed fennel seed and chili flake. Brushed it over the potatoes then added some Parm. Last step was the gravy. 
7967 2018-03-04 20:39:52 Honestly, my favorite way of making coffee is with a French press. It takes a bit longer and need a bit more work. But the final output is so much smoother and rounder, partially because of coffee oil, that it’s worth it for me.
7968 2018-03-04 20:39:47 Unfortunately, I'm only too familiar w/the greed & hypocrisy that Hatch most likely used to disuade his guilt. In his mind, he was only helping fulfill Mormon prophecy about the "Great Oil Fields"of UT.
7969 2018-03-04 20:39:32 Oh. And don't ever use coconut oil if you have potbelly pigs as they will try to climb you to get to your hair.

7976 2018-03-04 20:38:49 Correction..American and French soldiers never fought Biafra.French govt actually saved a lot of Biafran Children. French govt deserves oil not Land when Biafra becomes FREE.

7979 2018-03-04 20:37:37 £25billion! That’s nearly a years grudging Westminster pocket money for Scotland. But then, not a problem when you have wisely built up an approx 800bn fund from your oil and gas revenues.

7983 2018-03-04 20:36:07 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
7984 2018-03-04 20:36:04 Oil what’s wrong
7985 2018-03-04 20:35:46 If RNH secures the top LW spot (which I can't see why he wouldn't) that opens up the option to have a cheaper 3C. Who do you think the Oil go after or who do you is a good option for that spot (e.g. Bozak-type in Free Agency)?

7987 2018-03-04 20:35:44 Tips: Lightly grease your heated pan with a little butter or light spray cooking oil for each cake. watch the bubbles on the top has it cooks when slow edges cake to keep from burning & flip over. Also use medium - medium high heat.
7988 2018-03-04 20:35:17 And I pointed out that you seem to have a double standard.
I also pointed out that I don't like how people that are opposed to the oil and gas industry do the same to my friends and family.
7989 2018-03-04 20:35:15 If only we had a sovereign oil wealth fund of more than a £1,000,000,000,000+ and not having to carry the burden of Westminster’s debt of £1,989,450,000,000+..... 

Oil, such a terrible curse!!
7990 2018-03-04 20:35:11 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?
7991 2018-03-04 20:34:53 Guyana is taking advice from Japan on oil and gas?  Why not collaborate with a country experienced in oil and gas. Selling off your oil blocks before you even get started, is this a cash grab?

7993 2018-03-04 20:34:48 Cheers Mate,

I think there's a good year for oil and getting Malcy on is useful for punters in understanding the broader picture.
7994 2018-03-04 20:34:40 I’m wondering if it was $750M - wish I could find the article, it was comparing the Wine Industry costs which was small in comparison to the economic fallout for B.C. if oil companies did business elsewhere

8003 2018-03-04 20:34:05 Oh, and while you're at it, stop using modes of transport that depend on oil & oil by-products....so no planes, trains, automobiles, motorcycles, scooters, trams, buses, ferries, helicopters, bicycles, etc. I think that will leave you horses, buggies, camels, donkeys, etc..

8006 2018-03-04 20:33:30 Cheers Paul, my interest was to compare notes on the oil price in general after a few personal chats. What Malcy does or doesn't no business of mine. I can confirm that I wasn't remunerated to do it.

I enjoy it.

8009 2018-03-04 20:33:00 Btw did you know I used to own about half one of the world’s first commercial oil fields near Petrolia in northern Texas? Started production at start of 20th C. Still produces at a slow rate from shallow sands. Roughly 9mth payback period via truck mounted drilling.

8026 2018-03-04 20:30:42 Message for my climate alarmist friends:
We do not HAVE to go nuclear. We still have LOADS of natural gas, coal and oil globally. HOWEVER, if you insist CO2 is a serious problem then there is no possible way to a global low CO2 economy without nuclear. Full stop.
8027 2018-03-04 20:30:40 It is beyond heartbreaking but tragically we’ve seen this before. Look at the other places in the world that are living through war & severe oppression.
There is more concern if there’s “something in it for us” like oil.
Human lives have been demoted as far as their importance!!!
8028 2018-03-04 20:30:40 Surely these people are getting paid off to do it. Someone is behind this. Making everyone poor=control. How long until some foreign entity comes in to "help" , buy up commodities(SA has large resources) ,or start something there. Look at Venezuela(owes China $70+Billion in oil).
8029 2018-03-04 20:30:40 Oil na oil...

8030 2018-03-04 20:30:38 Whatever happened to US Steel?

we must rebuild our depleted industry, steel, as oil is essential for the US to remain the world leader, world super power.

It is good business, Trump sees it, ran on it, keeping his promises, yet so few will back him up!

8035 2018-03-04 20:29:45 I might consider your point of view when, and only when, you go through your wardrobe, all you belongings & every material thing you possess and discard anything & everything that contains any component that exists because of oil. Unless it says 100% cotton or wool, be rid of it
8036 2018-03-04 20:29:34 No need to oil if it’s got some fat on the exterior

8039 2018-03-04 20:29:01 i think #Hydrogen #FCEV vehicles is the coal version of Oil@Gas industry. They keep fighting to keep coal alive although nobody makes money off it so coal is a sort of a buffer to oil and methane gas.

8053 2018-03-04 20:25:20 “A country without steel is not a country”, with that, Trump has the wisdom, the vision, to realize we must rebuild our steel industry, which has lost hundreds of thousands workers thru the years, we must be independent, as we are now with oil!

8099 2018-03-04 20:19:36 It is easy to be socialist with Norway oil.
8100 2018-03-04 20:19:28 Our national parks and areas of environmental risk should not be opened to oil, shale fracking and deep sea oil drilling. Our national forests must not be destroyed by blowing off the tops of mountains for drilling, nor our forests destroyed by logging. 2)

8104 2018-03-04 20:19:13 Most dandruff is from not shampooing frequently enough. A good tea tree oil will do the same if it’s a fungal dandruff. The organix brand tea tree oil I highly recommend

8106 2018-03-04 20:18:54 Irrigation canals... San Martin (de Trevejo). Crumbling castle ... Trevejo. 
Pitarra wine, great olive oil and delicious goat cheese... It could be either.

8108 2018-03-04 20:18:40 Never said I wasn’t getting 72 miles per gallon of veggie oil in the process!
8109 2018-03-04 20:18:39 Is that good for the game? When an oil rich country can own a team and buy up most of the best players in the world? @premierleague
8110 2018-03-04 20:18:25 This is Rahul baba when so called family-less politicians are burning mid night oil to get a chance to serve people! 
8111 2018-03-04 20:18:18 Most Big Oil producers are also Big Gas producers. Raw materials usually come out of same reservoirs, but with some variations in proportions. Exxon, Shell, Total, and Chevron produce about as many MTOE in gas as in oil.
8112 2018-03-04 20:18:08 Pretty harsh. What has the seed oil ever done to you?!
8113 2018-03-04 20:18:02 Finding the oil isn't the problem, get it to the surface!!

8120 2018-03-04 20:17:01 @Swedish_Glace can you please confirm if your products contain palm oil as the labels don't seem to specify. Thank you.
8121 2018-03-04 20:16:59 The highlights of the day will be cooking, cleaning, and changing the oil
8122 2018-03-04 20:16:58 The people I've been following have never spoken about CBD oil until now. Of course.
8123 2018-03-04 20:16:48 We do mot seem to be ready for anything, not a sky is falling kind of guy but we do not seem to have an answer for a hostile US government, getting our oil to market in a safe manner,  post fossil fuel era, manufacturing, stop giving our natural resources away...
8124 2018-03-04 20:16:46 African leaders must be lashed paa.

Why must this happen, when you export oil but at the same time importing that same oil into the country. eeei 

Why not invest the money you we get into a refinery ,hmmm . Is really sad

8130 2018-03-04 20:15:53 That is a nice pairing 
8131 2018-03-04 20:15:52 Getting my oil changed and the guy had to get me to open my hood  Maybe I shouldn’t be here...
8132 2018-03-04 20:15:37 Are you proud of the thousands we, the US, have killed for the expansion of the US empire?  Blood and oil and treasure.
8133 2018-03-04 20:15:34 They sell it pre-made at Mariano’s. I would suggest giving it an extra sprinkle of salt and oil just to be safe
8134 2018-03-04 20:15:22 So glad I just bought coconut oil since I ran out A MONTH AGO

8141 2018-03-04 20:14:34 There no problem. Poppi made of special alloy. No need for rust or oil.
8142 2018-03-04 20:14:34 I accidentally dumped way too much oil into the pot for popcorn. I wonder how fucked it’s gonna be
8143 2018-03-04 20:14:30 Don't forget to always use massage oil before, during, and after sex!
8144 2018-03-04 20:14:28 Palm oil derives about as many calories per acre as other oils, which still have greatly lower land usage than animal products. #WeDontNeedMeat or oils. Environmentalists should be vegan and restrict oil usage.
8145 2018-03-04 20:14:27 Liberalism and communist are the same thing it only profits and empowers the people at the top. Examples North Korea, China, Russia, Venezuela. Venezuela the riches oil nation in South America. People ands dogs eating out of Trash Cans. USA
8146 2018-03-04 20:14:15 You cannot build the new economy by killing the old one- guaranteed backlash. You have to leverage it.  Nobody is promoting fossil fuels, their use is declining, esp coal. Every bbl of Canadian oil sold means the Saudi's don't and Canadians will spend it on OUR future #cdnpoli
8147 2018-03-04 20:14:10 Every army took spoils of war til today. Have a go at the US when they took all the oil unjustly after killing over half a mill civilians as 'war' booty.

8150 2018-03-04 20:13:36 oh damn dude i didnt think of that. I went out and got Grass fed butter to mix with my coconut oil in my coffee and thats awesome! im pretty excited, didnt think to put vanilla in there
8151 2018-03-04 20:13:27 In a Nigeria, a ship loaded with oil went missing, a satellite disappeared into thin air, 10 dead people were appointed as Heads of Boards by the President, the National Budget was alleged to be missing, a "snake & monkey swallowed millions"  on d way, What a country
8152 2018-03-04 20:13:16 Look. There’s some people that believe “big oil” keeps suppressing technology that allows cars to run on ****, you name it.  There’s no way some egotistical dr isn’t going to publish cure if legit.  Doesn’t make sense.  Wouldn’t insurances prefer a cure?
8153 2018-03-04 20:13:11 I left oil on fire on the cooker and fell asleep for three hours. Woke up and the whole house smells of gas/oil. 
Thank God my mum isn’t Home cos she wouldn’t let me hear the end of it
8154 2018-03-04 20:12:56 . I can relate. If you are weak you end up changing your mind like "Ok, cancel it, I will have cooking oil instead."
8155 2018-03-04 20:12:49 tomorrow i have to go get a oil change and air in my tires 
8156 2018-03-04 20:12:36 Promoters of solar panels and wind turbines are wittingly or unwittingly shilling for natural gas and/or coal producers.
Oil is actually quite independent.
8157 2018-03-04 20:12:21 Ive run out of #amaretto as Kate keeps slugging it back. Ide rather have #beer myself. Have a fab week you two xx

8159 2018-03-04 20:12:11 Gym is not my friend so if I keep my fat/oil intake low I do so.
8160 2018-03-04 20:12:01 You should look at ghee ( or you can make your own clarified butter and mix that with vanilla extract and coconut oil for a good creamer for your coffee
8161 2018-03-04 20:11:59 Ok perfect skin ppl what dO YOU DO BC I DRINK ENOUGH WATER TO KILL ME EVERYDAY AND I DONT EAT DAIRY AND I WASH MY FACE ALL THE TIME N TEA TREE OIL IS AMAZING BUT NOT AMAZING ENOUGH. SPILL YOUR SECRETS
8162 2018-03-04 20:11:58 Hey I had to go home to get my tires rotated and get an oil change so we are just gonna have to go to the movies tomorrow night. Sorry @selenagomez
8163 2018-03-04 20:11:55 Yeah Roman has restructured the club.. Not spending as much.. The Oligarch won't match the Oil rich clubs. Though Conte is not making any friends with his comments in the press also. Can't see him staying long now
8164 2018-03-04 20:11:46 Every time. Tried the fats, nowhere near as good IMHO.   Lots of cold oil and melted butter. And turn every 15 mins for 90mins. Come out with a crunchy thick crust and soft middle.
8165 2018-03-04 20:11:46 i normally just use an oil and water, or a deep conditioning cream. but yes send me a picture.
8166 2018-03-04 20:11:35 Arsenal needs some oil money investment. None is forthcoming. 
So they have to keep going down in order to find oil themselves.
8167 2018-03-04 20:11:26 Deep in the Ghost in the Shell portion of this Yoko Kanno video, have on my wraparound sunglasses and trenchcoat, eating only energy bars and drinking motor oil now
8168 2018-03-04 20:11:14 Decedents of those that worked in the whale oil industry agree with this message?
8169 2018-03-04 20:11:02 We've seen this same cycle play out for Tillerson yet he's the ex-CEO of Exxon with Big Oil connections that just happened to fly to Russia shortly after his appointment as Secretary of State.
8170 2018-03-04 20:10:57 Criminals and human rights is like water and oil .   Police must use maximum force against criminals. They dont deserve to see another day.
8171 2018-03-04 20:10:39 - to grow back where the hole is, usually tea tree oil helps get rid of them within 2-4 days. not everyone gets keloids tho. and also the healing process doesn’t hurt either!
8172 2018-03-04 20:10:34 Manufacturing facts:

1. Manufacturing is still the largest sector of the US economy. 

2. We are the no. 2 exporter in the world. 

3. Overall manufacturing output by the United States has grown over the last 40 years. 

4. By 2020 we’ll be one of the top oil exporters
8173 2018-03-04 20:10:25 The way Chelsea and arsenal re going down in table, am sure they will soon discover crude oil
8174 2018-03-04 20:10:21 子猫なら…あっやっぱ無理っ(逃
8175 2018-03-04 20:10:10 I’ve been putting oil and stuff in it but I swear nothings helping 
8176 2018-03-04 20:10:08 バターとかマーガリンとか知らないけど多分吸ったぜ。
8177 2018-03-04 20:09:56 My dad changed my oil, transmission fluid, rotated my tires and washed my car....he then told me I need new struts and tires 
8178 2018-03-04 20:09:46 Lots of people didn't insulate condensation pipe on boilers which then froze over, caused a lot of breakdowns as some boilers need resetting after, lots of others ran out of heating oil because they hadn't expected it to be this cold, causes major issues #burystedmundshour
8179 2018-03-04 20:09:39 im pretty sure i have olive oil and parmesan in my kitchen but thats all i have
8180 2018-03-04 20:09:34  imma make sure to get you some . It’s the all natural oil I make by hand . It’s amazing if I don’t say so myself 
8181 2018-03-04 20:09:30 Oil fields do. Shrink the parks until the oil reserves are revealed and start drilling
8182 2018-03-04 20:09:27 Earlier - reading Doctor Who and the Loch Ness Monster ( Terrance Dicks )  to children 8 + 5. ) On the first page, a Jock Munro ( on the oil rig Bonnie Prince Charlie ) complains that the English are unable to cook haggis .
8183 2018-03-04 20:09:17 Again what affects would any trade disruption cause to rUk not already out of the EU and without Scotlands GDP and oil propping up the £ they would have to trade they would not be in any position to especially if Scotland was a member of the SM.
8184 2018-03-04 20:09:11 If I take these pills will they make me smart enough to not fall for snake oil like these pills?
8185 2018-03-04 20:09:05 If you don’t know shit about cars and you go to the mechanic. They will try their best to play tf outta you  you go in there for an oil change they wanna tell you that you need a whole new engine. Bihhh lmao
8186 2018-03-04 20:09:02 I wish I could find the Calgary Hearld article identifying the amount of economic benefit to B.C. companies doing business with AB oil patch something like $170M and thousands of people employed
8187 2018-03-04 20:08:54 o gun oil e o one move são ótimos tb (mas esse último é bem mais caro)
8188 2018-03-04 20:08:50 @jiffylube over an hour for an oil change and Forgetting to put the oil cap back on is inexcusable.
8189 2018-03-04 20:08:41 If you plan on having any pets or do, tea tree oil is one to stay away from.
8190 2018-03-04 20:08:32 Like Big Oil? Yeah.
8191 2018-03-04 20:08:28 But it is running out, there is less than half of the oil available than there was when it was discovered, also more and more industries are moving away from fossil fuels so the demand won't be as big, plus they're producing oil all over the world much much cheaper now.
8192 2018-03-04 20:08:26 is this going tobe the longest night??
8193 2018-03-04 20:08:23 Exfoliating dove bar soap. You don’t want to dry the skin out too much because it will produce more oil to compensate! Ponds as a moisturizer, I love their anti-wrinkle formula
8194 2018-03-04 20:08:15 Adulting is finding out that olive oil is more expensive than it should be.
8195 2018-03-04 20:08:12 Forgot to roll a doink for gore. Was pretty bummed until the first gondola I hoped into had a dude and his wife passing me a oil cart 
8196 2018-03-04 20:07:57 Do I need to oil a pork roast and then add the rub, or should the roast be dry? Can't wait to try this. Ode to my Polish dad tonight!
8197 2018-03-04 20:07:49 He is a city boy. The grocery store and vending machines are his food sources. Does he even change his own oil? He is simply too specialized. In an emergency situation, he will not do well. I have seen this in too often. And is an example of the liberal, city living majority.
8198 2018-03-04 20:07:42 I used tea tree oil for my nose piercing. It’s really strong smelling but it’s really helpful
8199 2018-03-04 20:07:39 @realDonaldTrump Are you serious. Steal Canadian  oil in Alberta  Canada  well take you dirty hotels and Us Crap as well my Lumber here in Canada  you idiot. think  you can be a bully in this world. You take my oil .why don't you  just buy Saudi  oil and get lost.
8200 2018-03-04 20:07:35 Oil change & new brakes for my baby
8201 2018-03-04 20:07:33 Good job Firelake. Way to not oil your lanes before league just because you didn’t have a mechanic this morning.
8202 2018-03-04 20:07:22 Typically, NPR tries to make this altruistic.  I would like to know if his “experiment” has been given or promised any research funding, and exactly how is the difference “redistributed to minorities who buy food at the stall?”  No different than a snake oil salesman...
8203 2018-03-04 20:06:57 I get that :). But “lemon oil” is not the same thing as “juice”.  It’s just misleading is all I’m saying.
8204 2018-03-04 20:06:40 You know what's really unpleasant? Getting your Discover card statement and seeing concert tickets AND a recent heating oil delivery appearing in the same billing cycle.
8205 2018-03-04 20:06:21 careful now, they'll confiscate everything and leave you in a hut w/ a mat if they really like you  @Oil_Guns_Merica
8206 2018-03-04 20:06:14 Someone described Blockchain IP to me as snake oil. I tend to agree. Im not sure what SX has, but I haven't seen enough to get me all that excited. Most of my excitement came from an ex CEO cheerleading on twitter, throwing out numbers. Great learning experience.
8207 2018-03-04 20:06:09 Coconut oil !
8208 2018-03-04 20:06:04 The right atmosphere is created with flowers, subdued lighting, oil paintings and deep carpeting.
8209 2018-03-04 20:05:56 Oil & gel strips available on amazon. McDonald’s ... should be in your area for emergencies alone
8210 2018-03-04 20:05:53 Not at all, I’m on of principle and sleep well at night knowing the club has history, tradition and prestige which will only serve it well going forward. City however, have a shelf life and when the oil runs out so do they and it’ll be back to reality!
8211 2018-03-04 20:05:53 500m LOL it's all about oil money..
8212 2018-03-04 20:05:48 even when I get the ones supposedly for sensitive skin they make my face tingle like crazy, maybe try using a cleansing oil? haven't myself but I know some people do
8213 2018-03-04 20:05:28 It is easier for a camel to pass through an eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. I'm guessing old Billy didn't read that one or was just one big snake oil salesman. I'm betting on the latter of the two.
8214 2018-03-04 20:05:27 Yes I do I’m with Verizon now ,this oil field life done changed me
8215 2018-03-04 20:05:21 Just tea tree oil  lol

8220 2018-03-04 20:04:09 I’m over truffle oil.
8221 2018-03-04 20:03:43 This is what happens when you try to destroy a terrorist group with another. IS only have small desert area of Syria while PYD/PKK have more than 20% including more than 80% oil reserves of Syria. It seems PYD/PKK is a bigger cancer then IS now for the unity of Syria
8222 2018-03-04 20:03:41 We did the vid almost a year ago... oil mattress vids are fun lol
8223 2018-03-04 20:03:34 Yet oil is highly subsidized sooooo....

8229 2018-03-04 20:02:57 Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, they will be forgiven.
James 5:14
8230 2018-03-04 20:02:54 Some sexy white lingerie with oil to keep your amazing ass shiny and wet while that dick slides in nice and deep. Your ass is amazing. You are amazing. 
8231 2018-03-04 20:02:23 Your view of the floor is totally obscured by a thick, black oil.
8232 2018-03-04 20:02:18 Yeah, I need to remember to get some. I’m up to my eyeballs in olive oil so I never think about picking up other oils.

8245 2018-03-04 20:01:02 I agree but this means war with the oil empire and that means they will hinder us as best they can. It won't be easy. Gates is a liar.

8266 2018-03-04 19:57:17 The oil is Lemon Oil, which is derived from the skin of the lemon and is to enhance the flavor of concentrate. The others are to preserve & extend shelf life. Your feedback is important and we have notified the Quality Control Department of your concern.
8267 2018-03-04 19:57:16 Mate, you can't compete with the scousers right now and they haven't even got any oil money. They have an eye for talent and a decent manager, though.
8268 2018-03-04 19:57:16 I was stunned momentarily. Same  Gulf Oil  began stalking me on my IG account.
8269 2018-03-04 19:57:11 Standing in the parking lot of Walmart in our church dresses @_edukate, putting oil in my car,  men asking if we needed help. "No, we got it. Don't let the dresses and heels fool ya."
But maybe I should be thankful that some men are still gentlemen (and that I live in the south)

8271 2018-03-04 19:57:04 Time for Canada to stop scratchin heads over US and start making up your own future. Get real in oil&gas and exports. Fight fire with fire.
8272 2018-03-04 19:56:51 And despite the rumours I am not in the pay of Big Oil! How rich I would be if I were. I wouldn't have to tweet from a second hand piece of kit for a start!

8277 2018-03-04 19:55:27 We were once beholden to Middle East for oil. No more! Fracking has enabled us to tap into oil in this country that is bigger than Saudi Arabia and to the point where WE can be exporters of oil!
8278 2018-03-04 19:55:19 However, if bowl games were my only factor- I’d say Mtn West has a far better chance of a New Year 6 game. I haven’t been much of a fan of these “Craft Macaroni and Cheese” bowl games presented by “Doterra  Oil”.

8281 2018-03-04 19:54:52 Ummm, everything Obama touched completely went to shit .. Syria, Myanmar, Libya, etc.  The only thing your article should be about is outrage for handing out the Nobel peace prize for the sake of diversity, and counterproductive accomplishments.  Obama is snake oil.
8282 2018-03-04 19:54:50 That’s not what they are actually doing here. We already have laws provincial & national parks and protected water ways galore. This is land appropriation and shutting down oil production in Canada. Farmers are going to go down.
8283 2018-03-04 19:54:49 Tried that and nothing... Well, it took some of the un-burnt oil off, but not much else.
8284 2018-03-04 19:54:47 GOP has always cherry-picked their issues. Protect the unborn fetus but don't guarantee prenatal care to mom and baby. Social security and Medicare are entitlements that can be cut but subsidies to oil companies are sacrosanct. GOP hypocrisy.

8288 2018-03-04 19:54:25 Sorry to disagree but "Catholicism" was one of the few books that infuriated me so much with its glib snake oil plagiarisms & ha'penny anecdotes & faux intellectualism and secularised pieties & group hug neoprotestantism that I wanted my money back!

8302 2018-03-04 19:52:28 Dear Boris, thank you for addressing this. The UK can do more than words, i.e. to invest in awareness campaigns wrt palm oil, anti-poaching brigades,  stopping the growth of the world population and financing anti-corruption campagnes. Thank you for your help. Chris
8303 2018-03-04 19:52:26 The message isn’t getting out from the Sunday news shows.. we cannot become reliant on foreign imported steel and aluminum... remember the 70s jimmy Carter, oil embargo, opec control, disaster..!  The message wasn’t conveyed on how much we rely on them already .. too much !!!

8331 2018-03-04 19:48:49 You are not asking the right questions?!... what is the share of the total steel produced is imported?.. if it is more than 20%, we are in trouble .. we cannot be reliant on imported steel and aluminum. We will be in trouble .. remember jimmy cater and 70s oil embargo????
8332 2018-03-04 19:48:47 I really wouldn’t like that. I may be odd, but I’d rather come second every year doing it the right way than rely on a huge bung.  If Disney came and ran it properly, then fine, but not oil money etc.  That’s just not us at all.

8347 2018-03-04 19:46:41 Understand rhetoric. China doesn’t dump steel anywhere in particular. They overproduce to world demand which drives down prices. Companies buy cheeper steal anywhere because everyone needs to sell cheep to compete with China. OPEC has been doing this with oil for years.

8380 2018-03-04 19:42:19 That is what I am saying - they will just discover later - ppl think everything they think is right until they find out they’re wrong! Like ‘coconut oil’    I still am not convinced things like chairs cannot Feel so I am always gentle!
8381 2018-03-04 19:42:12 LOL the Middle East had its golden age while Europe fumbled around in the dark.

Also we really effed up the Middle East for the oil.
8382 2018-03-04 19:42:11 Delicious! :D

I'm cooking pasta served with a sauteed diced organic local tomatoes in olive oil and garlic reduction together with fresh basil and fresh diced mozzarella cheese! Wheat baguette with olive oil as an accompaniment. ^^
8383 2018-03-04 19:42:10 That bread was sprinkled with olive oil and popped in the oven . Proper delish
8384 2018-03-04 19:42:01 Thanks for confirming, Gerik. I'm troubled my state rep seemed unaware. Should legislators vote for items they don't know the basic facts of? Although w/ so much testimony explaining, I don't know how they couldn't know the facts. Maybe our reps r beholden to auto/oil donors 
8385 2018-03-04 19:42:01 Thank you Amber for giving Aliol a shout out. I’ve literally just applied my desert rose facial oil too. Love it 
8386 2018-03-04 19:41:54 Bitches will put oil on their face and go in sunlight talking about “I’m glowing” BITCH IF YOU DON’T GET YOUR ASS BACK IN THE HOUSE GLEKGMSMVMMCN
8387 2018-03-04 19:41:44 If anyplace put truffle oil on a mushroom swiss burger, I'd be a customer for life 
8388 2018-03-04 19:41:29 Water fasting and oil pulling goes hand in hand, I swear 
8389 2018-03-04 19:41:28 Don’t worry @EggEyeCubbins  I can hook you up with a leave in moisturizer. And @SantaVyRT with some beard oil which is a dual purpose btw keeps the tats looking fresh as well.
8390 2018-03-04 19:41:14 Mostly dietary interventions, but some supplements such as EPA fish oil are very helpful as well. Quackery is for fools like you who would let the child run into traffic because it would be "abusive" to stop him.
8391 2018-03-04 19:40:53 (extremely uk guy voice) well thats another vocab word of the day, i just fought it was funny how oiru sounds loik oil. dont forget to smash that loik button.
8392 2018-03-04 19:40:51 Bullshit. Iran was a democratic country before the 50s, when the US (and the UK) started the Ajax Operation, to overtake their oil resources, which brought to the rise of Ayatollah Khomeini, which then turned Iran into an islamic country in the 70s, led by extremists.
8393 2018-03-04 19:40:49 Yes! Hot oil too!
8394 2018-03-04 19:40:46 Selling my car! 2009 Kia Optima, 110k miles, good condition, recent oil change/maintenance. Message me for more details if you’re interested!
8395 2018-03-04 19:40:33 おにーさんにまかせとけー！
8396 2018-03-04 19:40:17 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！
8397 2018-03-04 19:39:25 That is not socialism fault its corruption and a collapse of the oil that caused Venezuela's crisis and a failure to diversify there economy
8398 2018-03-04 19:39:22 6k is almost standard in all new cars! If your car has an oil gauge, usually when it’s between 40-50% oil life is when a good time to change it is!
8399 2018-03-04 19:39:07 I do, good ol thc oil :3
8400 2018-03-04 19:39:06 I'm getting my oil changed at this place near my work and it's almost twice as much as the place near my parents house. 

Serious question, is full synthetic oil different than normal oil? 
8401 2018-03-04 19:38:52 Bar soap to cleanse, my preferred oil(coconut for me, but it don't work for everyone) combined with sea salt to scrub.
8402 2018-03-04 19:38:46 You just gave me a great idea on how to collect the oil, wait till is cool and collect it with my dabbing tool. Thanks
8403 2018-03-04 19:38:43 Could be used for wave power experiments
Unique Defence
New oil fields
Developments we can’t even imagine right now
#Scotsgovt would be open to that. Modern
8404 2018-03-04 19:38:34 use coconut oil to achieve it my frend, thats what i did
8405 2018-03-04 19:38:33 Applying coconut oil every night to your face (including lashes) does wonders
8406 2018-03-04 19:38:29 The fact that I'm the "gen guy" in this place will forever be funny to me.
Check oil, check plug, fuel too
8407 2018-03-04 19:38:13 We produce more than we consume in western Canada.
Eastern Canada imports oil to meet its demands. 
We can’t get a pipeline built to eastern Canada. So they rely on imports from the Middle East and Venezuela.
BC does not produce enough oil to meet its needs.
8408 2018-03-04 19:38:10 My father papa bushiri i am verry thankfull for you but i do not untherstand wy people use youre good name in vaine my husband was calledt and prophesyt by a fake bushiri and asking allot of us dollars for soap and oil but we new it was not you becouse you are a prophet of class
8409 2018-03-04 19:38:09 So then let’s screw them on getting oil from us
8410 2018-03-04 19:38:01 Fish oil, gargle salt water
8411 2018-03-04 19:37:56 I have the best recipe for Tri-Tip with a tequila, lime, garlic, soy sauce, cumin, oregeno,pepper, cilantro, olive oil maranade.  Yummy, Yummy.
8412 2018-03-04 19:37:55 Yes, but we don’t need alternatives which are lies, conspiracy theory rubbish to sell gullible people worthless food/ health supplements. Jones is an American archetype- he’s a hustler, a snake oil salesman
8413 2018-03-04 19:37:54 Adding he did some kind of questionable stuff [like torture ?] to other Prince's who don't always agree with him, and is moving forward w/ Aramco - & that is the MOAB  for an oil comp sale
8414 2018-03-04 19:37:52 While you are waiting put baby oil him.
8415 2018-03-04 19:37:50 America should be out of the Middle East. But the capitalists won’t allow that. Neither will Israel. Take it up with Israel- that’s why America is there in the first place- that and oil. Assad wouldn’t even use Russia if it wasn’t for oil.
8416 2018-03-04 19:37:41 Burning the midnight oil. Tracing you
8417 2018-03-04 19:37:30 Oil my ass and beat it down like I just brought home all Fs on my report card. Punish me 
8418 2018-03-04 19:37:11 Can someone make sure Chad is using synthetic motor oil and getting it changed every 7,500 miles at a minimum? I’m worried about viscosity breakdown.
8419 2018-03-04 19:37:03 Now I feel slow lol When I was home all I used was Tea tree oil. Idk why I stopped. Thanks, girl!
8420 2018-03-04 19:36:54 every so often i see tweets about how 2 in 1 shampoo/conditioner is not okay to use and i just wanna say not only is it okay, but using more than one substance to clean your hair is petty bourg snake oil neo-victorianism.
8421 2018-03-04 19:36:50 Government should also stop depending on crude oil and other mineral resources to run the affairs of government
8422 2018-03-04 19:36:33 Boost body lotion with baby oil If you?re craving shiny legs that aren?t greasy.
8423 2018-03-04 19:36:24 Yes , great to seeing ur gorgeous cover oil and you took it in ur ass like a champ even it's ur first 1st Anal scene, love it

8426 2018-03-04 19:35:50 and their economical needs for oil "deal...
8427 2018-03-04 19:35:35 @VO5 Why does your website show VO5 Hot Oil yet I can't buy this anywhere in the UK?
8428 2018-03-04 19:35:11 that’s good and we are all so happy you are getting better!!!! 
8429 2018-03-04 19:35:10 @VanJones68: the all time king of lies nobody believed remains ur peep @BarackObama: the same who drew a red line on Syria's chemical weapons,then ignored,blurred & did squat about it.Same ACA snake oil salesman who said we'd save $2,500/yr. Sincef U like him U can keep him, Van.
8430 2018-03-04 19:35:03 Fat girls are too Lazy in bed. Unless you turn them like Bofrot in Hot oil 
8431 2018-03-04 19:34:44 FWIW, I suspect adaptation to US Light Tight Oil availability will depend on the local demand barrel. In which view inland US refiners’ll adapt to handle LTO because hinterland gasoline demand justifies it. I am told this has already happened with condensate.
8432 2018-03-04 19:34:43 They're trying to keep us apart.  What are they afraid of?  I lost 500 followers this week when my acct was locked.  We'll MAGA!!!
8433 2018-03-04 19:34:30 There was a lot of oil money at Bayern and Barca
8434 2018-03-04 19:34:28 La pregunta ante el cambio es: cómo era y cómo será el tratamiento de las grandes causas (Oca, Indalo, Oil...)?

8436 2018-03-04 19:33:58 So this is a ‘Scottish’ problem? All bad is Scottish. Lady we do@t even need oil. We’re just about to wipe the floor with renewables.
8437 2018-03-04 19:33:52 Everyone should invest in wool dryer balls and essential oils . Instead of using dryer sheets (which are bad for your skin) you dab an essential oil of your choice (lavender, peppermint, teatree, etc.) on a wool dryer ball & put it in the dryer w/ your clothes. Thank me later. 
8438 2018-03-04 19:33:39 most wars are religion based, or used to be, a lot oil now, and not guilty of telling lies, but believing them , not judging anyone dude, just fed up with nazi white supremacists
8439 2018-03-04 19:33:38 Author Peter Doran here! Do hope you have a chance to check out Breaking Rockefeller. I've always loved a good story about oil, greed, and underdogs.
8440 2018-03-04 19:33:36 we always do canned (in oil--in water is too dry for sandwiches). Spread the harissa, drizzle some oil, add the tuna and then some thinly sliced tomato 
8441 2018-03-04 19:33:11 O I woke up achy this morning! So I reached for Badger Ginger Deep Tissue Massage Oil (formerly Sore Muscle Therapy Oil). Hard to find in my local health food store nowadays (the Badger Balm in tins doesn't cut it for me). I found a great price @LuckyVitamin online!#LuckyVitamin
8442 2018-03-04 19:32:42 Some hair oil brand will sign you for their next brand campaign. 
8443 2018-03-04 19:32:31 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
8444 2018-03-04 19:32:28 I will provide oil, pot and gas cooker sef
8445 2018-03-04 19:32:20 RT @Global_Witness: The biggest corporate bribery trial EVER starts tomorrow. $1.1 billion was siphoned off from a Nigerian oil deal. Listen to Barnaby Pace on @bbc5live at 8.45pm to find out more. #ShellKnew

8450 2018-03-04 19:30:47 Imma literally be on oil ALL day EVERY day while I'm in Miami acting like Ion have any home training 
8451 2018-03-04 19:30:36 I am a conservation biologist and professor. I teach what I live and do my best to live a carbon neutral lifestyle. I recommend everyone do it. What do we have to lose? We have less than 50 years of oil left and less than 100 years of other fuels. Easy human decision.
8452 2018-03-04 19:30:30 Keep your skin moisturized to make it stronger. Strong skin is less likely to get an infection, which can lead to #lymphedema. Coconut oil is a great choice, and is antibacterial. #OurTribe #breastcancer #KnowledgeIsPower #mastectomy #lumpectomy #radiation
8453 2018-03-04 19:30:28 Expecting a strong week in global equities as Europe finds its way after German/Italian elections (perhaps some headlines but limited real risk). Oil should also be supportive of equities as Libyan production outages are likely boost crude (while also setting up a nice short).
8454 2018-03-04 19:30:28 Kids laughed really hard during the trailer for Peter Rabbit. During Paddington 2 they were like an oil painting.

8458 2018-03-04 19:29:26 Could only happen to us pal. From the most oil rich region in the world, crammed full of billionaire investment bankers we got GFH, from the land where the art of defending was born we got Bellusci and now from the land that gave us goalkeeping greats such as Maier, Khan & Neuer
8459 2018-03-04 19:29:21 "....? No, unless you're covered by an oil and other complicated things." Oh she did guess that he is an mechanic. After all she wouldn't be surprising.
8460 2018-03-04 19:29:20 @PeterJManning Dear Mr. Peter Manning, my company is a energy and financial company, dealing with crude oil and bank instruments, gold now, can you please send me your crude oil etc by email? qqzh7wqd@extra.ocn.ne.jp, energlobal88@ybb.ne.jp, skype nikenco
8461 2018-03-04 19:29:14 Dear President Trump and Secretary Zinke,
Please continue to keep the Arctic out of any new oil and gas leasing as you move forward with the revision of the Five-Year Program.
I'm deeply concerned about the risk new offshore oil drilling could pose for the Arctic.
Excellent!
8462 2018-03-04 19:29:10 The best things to use for your hair are coconut oil, olive oil (deadass) and aloe vera.
8463 2018-03-04 19:29:05 ي قلبي تفائلي هالمره رح نشد بتصويت حتى لو مافيه داعم حنا نجيبها مثل م جبنها المره الاول
8464 2018-03-04 19:28:58 tea tree oil fucks me up
8465 2018-03-04 19:28:56 Id only trade ck if it means were getting zadina or svechnikov .  then again why would oil do that?
8466 2018-03-04 19:28:54 Putin needs to sell oil.
8467 2018-03-04 19:28:48 Jason I want you to do to my back walls what the oil industry does to the environment pimp 
8468 2018-03-04 19:28:40 Regarding the palm oil. Maybe you should ask them instead of making assumptions?
8469 2018-03-04 19:28:40 Plenty of oil money at porto and inter.
8470 2018-03-04 19:28:32 So self righteous
Should google human rights violations of countries Canada imports oil from. And it’s likely delivered by the oil fairies & never sets sail on your precious seas.
8471 2018-03-04 19:28:21 Only reason for winning the popular vote...voter fraud across the board for democrats and she still couldn’t win!  Get over it loser!!
8472 2018-03-04 19:28:14 You can't eat gold bricks either. The oil standard made America a super power. Requiring countries to pay for oil with the dollar , gave it it's value. Which allowed us to trade Monopoly for items of value.
8473 2018-03-04 19:28:01 Haha no doubt eh Remi? I’m not an oil fan or hater but being a Bruins fan and seeing the shit Chia did in Boston (trading wheeler and Seguin for nothing and giving away NTCs and 7 mill deals like candy) I definitely feel your guys pain. He’s an awful GM
8474 2018-03-04 19:27:43 folk changing my oil so fucking funny

8478 2018-03-04 19:27:17 iirc, in the 1930s, Pew/sun oil (kochs of the day) teamed up with KKK to stop labor organizing in the south
8479 2018-03-04 19:27:16 Many thanks, I look forward to hearing from you and hope Waitrose can become a real force for positive change in the food industry, which currently has massive environmental impact and real sustainability challenges to face (I haven’t even mentioned palm oil yet.....)

8481 2018-03-04 19:27:04 Add about four drops of rosemary oil, peppermint oil, and sage oil into a tablespoon of coconut or olive oil and apply it to the areas that are thinning.
8482 2018-03-04 19:26:57 I got the one with coconut oil, it's bomb
8483 2018-03-04 19:26:46 it’s like mixin oil and water
8484 2018-03-04 19:26:39 Because doctors told them this what they should do. I guess the Palm oil they produce is used locally too.
8485 2018-03-04 19:26:29 D'après une étude, si vous mettez RTL2 vous avez 50%de chance de tomber sur Born in the USA de Bruce Springsteen et 50% de chance de tomber sur Beds are burning de Midnight Oil
8486 2018-03-04 19:26:26 Trying grapeseed oil tonight due to its similar smoke point to rapeseed oil (plus I had in in the larder).
8487 2018-03-04 19:26:21 No such thing as tar sands! See you prove my point over and over! Quebec lives off the Oil sand transfer payments! Thanks for coming out too play!

8489 2018-03-04 19:26:14 Also Russell isn’t worth anywhere near 4 million. Bruins get better out of guys like McQuaid (when healthy) and Miller for 1 million more combined. Chiarelli is destroying what could have been a strong team. I see it and I’m not even an Oil fan

8491 2018-03-04 19:25:49 And wow the hypocrisy of saving the sea life & oceans from potential damage, meanwhile civil rights in Venezuela & Middle East. You choose blood oil over clean Canadian product #shameful
8492 2018-03-04 19:25:42 I still have no words (in a good way) other than thank you. I'd forgotten all about it!  When I saw the box I was like, "Did she send me beard oil? Awwww.  She didn't have to do that!  I was going to buy some the next time I came to NS!"
8493 2018-03-04 19:25:34 next time just make some dressing
1 tablespoon dijon mustard
1/4 cup light vinegar
3/4 cup olive oil
salt
pepper
and a lot of stirring

Or you could just order a pizza 
8494 2018-03-04 19:25:33 If steel and aluminum are required for national security, then why not have a national stockpile, like the US does with crude oil? Wouldn't that be a  better solution than tariffs and a trade war?
8495 2018-03-04 19:25:29 I need to get an oil change soon.
8496 2018-03-04 19:25:19 Nakakaantok ba yung essential oil HAHAHAHA
8497 2018-03-04 19:25:11 I agree and it's never been fair, and I'm from Ontario, never voted liberal ever but so much government employment and unions get a big stake in where this government leans. It should really be more leaned to how much a province contributes. Alberta with biggest rights (oil fan)
8498 2018-03-04 19:25:05 Cup of oil? A few washers?
8499 2018-03-04 19:24:48 I took a shower to throw on clothes to run errands, i gotta come back in and shower to get dressed. That would be a waste of palmers cocoa butter body oil, palmers cocoa butter and Vaseline cocoa butter lotion
8500 2018-03-04 19:24:46 "But, but...oil money, financial fair play, we're jaded, it's not fair! I want my Mommy!"
8501 2018-03-04 19:24:33 We're supposed to eat Marijuana daily.

8506 2018-03-04 19:24:06 There's got to be a better name than "rapeseed" for that particular oil
8507 2018-03-04 19:23:52 So where are we getting the olive oil from if not from EU.
8508 2018-03-04 19:23:34 my car turned 10 this year and to celebrate it decided to start leaking oil
8509 2018-03-04 19:23:23 Coconut oil is a life saver 
8510 2018-03-04 19:22:59 Ignoring would be turning a blind eye to all that’s currently in place to keep transport safe. Ignoring would be the blind eye turned by groups aiming to hurt Canadians of all provinces. Yet have happily accepted royalties off oil for years.
8511 2018-03-04 19:22:48 I hate going to get my oil change because then it turns into everything is wrong and a million times more expensive
8512 2018-03-04 19:22:38 Also I've been making salad topped with 1/4 inch by 1/4 (small!!) tofu squares fried in olive oil and garlic powdered up, that size of cube makes them crispy but not hard and it's great
8513 2018-03-04 19:22:02 May we read it first? Where does the oil revenue go?
8514 2018-03-04 19:22:01 Kombucha juice is the new coconut oil 
8515 2018-03-04 19:21:27 I have no power for the day and my laptop is working which is weird. and my dad is on an oil rig doing some stuff there idk what but im all alone with my brother!
8516 2018-03-04 19:21:26 No say oil club skin you alive "@iam_mome01: This match aint interesting atol"
8517 2018-03-04 19:21:19 The clay masks dries my skin out like the desert. I also found out coconut oil doesn't work for my hair. It tangles my hair and makes it feel hard.

8519 2018-03-04 19:21:03 You people are such idiots!!!! If we don’t produce steel or aluminum in this country, then we are hostages to other countries in time of war!!!! Same goes with oil!!! These tax increases are are so small! I’m a lower middle class citizen and would gladly pay the increase.

8522 2018-03-04 19:20:33 What a superb album @embrace ...love Snake Oil especially, not a bad one on there . Looking forward to Manchester and seeing you once again @dannymcnamara
8523 2018-03-04 19:20:29 We used to get the @wholeearthfoods peanut butter. But they use palm oil so for the last few years we have been getting the @MeridianFoods ones.
8524 2018-03-04 19:20:29 I hate waiting for oil changes lol
8525 2018-03-04 19:20:26 PRIORITIES :1)Change forced mental institutions where they force drug as well as do other horrible things. 2) End War on Drugs where responsible adult's rights are violated. 3) STOP child spanking at tax-funded Public Schools. 4) End criminalization of adult to adult prostitutes
8526 2018-03-04 19:20:25 Farabee is snipe city. I've heard good things about Kotkaniemi and Kupari (FIN), I'm a huge fan of Hughes and Merkley (Oil need some off. dmen in their system). You've got two ridiculously talented RH'd dmen in Bouchard and Dobson too. 

And if Wahlstrom is there, no brainer...
8527 2018-03-04 19:20:25 Race? The race is on? Aren't you supposed to be intelligent? We've had the #technology for decades and it's being hindered by #oil giants.
8528 2018-03-04 19:20:21 Here in Oklahoma, teachers are TALKING! November cannot soon enough. Many of our officials care more about oil industry than education.
8529 2018-03-04 19:20:00 Tofu hack: cut into like 1 inch x 1/4 inch thick squares. Put some oil in a pan. Pan fry, flip, put some soy sauce, garlic powder, turmeric on (paprika too if you like it!) and flip again. U have little tofu eggies

8531 2018-03-04 19:19:45 Appreciate it bro, finding a good beard oil is hard
8532 2018-03-04 19:19:36 Palm oil, bad news. Educate, educate, educate. Is it possible? Do not use products made with palm oil, look at ingredient labels, make good choices.
8533 2018-03-04 19:19:29 I'm gonna make it even worse in my head by assuming that's a bad photo of an expertly-rendered oil painting
8534 2018-03-04 19:19:28 Soda is so damn delicious too bad its worse for you than drinking motor oil
8535 2018-03-04 19:19:22 you haven't beaten the oil in 2 straight seasons ...but yes no case for argument at all.

8542 2018-03-04 19:18:37 U are the last olive in the smallest branch in the Nato tree. Ur us and Russian bosses will squeeze u and make oil for their salads
8543 2018-03-04 19:18:27 Boil, sprinkle with olive oil, paprika and salt and you have pulpo! Serve on a wooden plate, with fresh white bread and chilled white wine. Yummy! Alternatively, you could walk the Camino and delay a while in Melide, the pulpo capital of Galicia! 
8544 2018-03-04 19:18:27 Need to get that piece of  back to Texas .... Jones and the RV are devaluing Lucas Oil Stadium .
8545 2018-03-04 19:17:50 I said there is enough but I do struggle when I open my fridge. I tend to keep big stouts and sours in my ‘cellar’ and buy in session beers at the weekend. That being said, being able to buy Neck Oil, Punk and Stone IPA from the supermarket down the road is a blessing.

8555 2018-03-04 19:16:57 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
8556 2018-03-04 19:16:42 I'd definitely send you a jar or two if I had teleportation or Prime bread like that lol. Something else that I find helpful for myself would also be fish oil supplements
8557 2018-03-04 19:16:11 Men who are extremely good looking are often full of themselves. 

Also, I simply find men with more irregular features (a slighly hooked nose or w/e) more attractive and interesting than those who look like oil paintings.
8558 2018-03-04 19:15:44 Palm oil reserves logging mining impacts would be no carbon stores less habitat and siltation
8559 2018-03-04 19:15:31 My current "protein snacks"/"protein bars" in my desk drawer at work are currently ... well... cans of tuna in extra virgin olive oil. Once excess oil is drained, it's 2:1 Protein-to-fat and 0 carbs. Requires a fork ou knife, tho.
8560 2018-03-04 19:15:30 Since British Columbia, Quebec, the radical environmentalists and their foreign donors won't let Western Canada build pipelines to export crude oil and natural gas, we should just pour bitumen all over the snow and light it on fire.
8561 2018-03-04 19:15:25 House is filled with aroma of rosemary-olive oil bread and asparagus/leek/potato soup. NOM NOM NOM. #isitlunchyet
8562 2018-03-04 19:15:18 TBH it's completely nuts Norway is a sovereign oil rich nation with $1tn+ in the bank. Scotland relies on pocket money from Westminster & all the while our oil money is squandered by UK Gov. on WMD's illegal imperialist wars etc.!
8563 2018-03-04 19:15:11 He's helping Putin by raising the cost of fracking pipelines and hurting solar, all to to protect Russian oil. #ImpeachTrumpNow
8564 2018-03-04 19:15:07 Once I grab my Chakra oil out my sisters car, this day is gonna be oh so valid.
8565 2018-03-04 19:15:06 Haha. Obviously. But also that the drivers of reduced child mortality aren't particularly the same drivers as biodiversity loss. E.g. palm oil plantations to satisfy western consumption habits vs vaccination programmes.
8566 2018-03-04 19:15:01 We don’t uses oil money
8567 2018-03-04 19:14:51 I put argan oil on my edges before I apply my wig and castor oil on my edges at night. I don’t oil the rest of my scalp as frequently as I should tbh
8568 2018-03-04 19:14:43 Right?  It was very hard for the oil companies bribing all the Brexit votes, especially considering that they were either senile or thick as fuck.  Keeping the conspiracy quiet was easy, too, because the media is controlled by tories. Leftist conspiracies really do take the cake.
8569 2018-03-04 19:14:41 There is a tie between Qatar money, the UAE, Russian Oil money and the Kushners. Would like some hard evidence on this. Everything has been circumstantial but there seems to be corroboration with other sources that are not directly tied to the Russian oligarchs
8570 2018-03-04 19:14:37 They understand. No wonder Aramco is planning IPO to monetise its reserves though oil prices much lower than 2011-13. They are struggling to cope. Monetising reserves & using IPO proceeds to diversify appears a good strategy
8571 2018-03-04 19:14:30 So you want the feds to do something about the price of oil internationally? Interesting.
8572 2018-03-04 19:14:29 #thearchers  Do the good die young? Well Peggy's a vampire and she's 164 and still alive

8574 2018-03-04 19:14:02 @FoxNewsSunday Remember when we were dependent on over seas OIL Chris Wallace? That was a national security issue, and you cheer our oil and gas independence now. Same principle applies to metals. We CAN'T be dependent on CHINA or the EU for STEEL/ALUMINUM for our MILITARY
8575 2018-03-04 19:13:50 Cars in Western PA have a high sodium diet.  If you wash, was and change oil most cars should get 200,000 miles.
8576 2018-03-04 19:13:49 So why not give one the chance of sitting on the bench for a PL game? He is the only manager I know of not to name a full squad for a PL game ..... pep the cheque book manager! Has quite a ring to it, let him spend the dirty oil money!
8577 2018-03-04 19:13:49 Just to put it context got you. City had won the league more times than Spurs before oil money.

8586 2018-03-04 19:13:02 Aluminum production eats up electricity like nothing else! The US AND CANADA have an oil problem. The fossil fuel industry has a stranglehold on our Congress. You guys do the tar sands production too and want to build pipelines in US to transport the dirtiest oil ever.
8587 2018-03-04 19:12:58 But you said ‘call me if you have any questions or if you need your car serviced’. I just want an oil change pal you gonna set it up or nah.

8590 2018-03-04 19:12:05 boil em down for OIL !
8591 2018-03-04 19:11:55 There are some churches today teaching Chrislam which is a perverted attempt to combine Jesus & Mohammad (the creator of ISLAM) in one church.  That's like trying to mix Oil and Water.

These churches are lead by Satan, not Christ and they are destroying lives.
8592 2018-03-04 19:11:51 They'll just say it anyways, or like they have any other comeback to use besides "oil money".
8593 2018-03-04 19:11:51 The way Arsenal is going down this season, very soon they may discover Oil.

8597 2018-03-04 19:11:31 Russia has managed to hold onto most of it's colonial territory, eg Siberia. Wants influence again in its "near abroad" to the South and West, & extending claims to subsea oil & gas in Arctic Ocean basins. How is it not still a colonial power? I don't accuse, just describe.

8607 2018-03-04 19:10:11 I find it funny you ancaps can never give a specific critique of WHY Venezuela is failing.  It's not just socialism it's their reliance on a single commodity (oil) which then crashed also the RW opposition hoarding food, killing people etc.

8614 2018-03-04 19:09:42 A case of needing to reinvest in the basic biology of Alzheimer’s. There are important clues there but the $ allure of profits blinded many (and still do) into snake oil.

8616 2018-03-04 19:09:18 Sometimes the actions do more harm than good. I live in Portland. A few years ago a protest broke out over an oil platform repair in our area. People suspended themselves from the bridge that blocked the moving of the platform. Meanwhile all car/trucks/buses stuck burning fuel.

8624 2018-03-04 19:08:39 No too much salt & non organic oil used in cooking. Basically, I don’t eat them since my PCP said either no salt with exercise or BP medication.
8625 2018-03-04 19:08:11 Our air source heat pump is boss. It's technically complicated, integrates solar with plumbing and electrics. It takes experts to service them and they are few and far between. It's hugely expensive to repair but still proud to be oil free. Technical schooling needed. OPPORTUNITY

8629 2018-03-04 19:07:54 @GuardianFeast in your recent feature ‘6 Of The Best Pickles & Ferments’ the Lime Pickle calls for 4 tbsp mustard oil. It’s proving impossible to find any that’s not labelled ‘for external use only’ due to the Erucic acid content. Can you confirm that it’s ok to consume this  oil
8630 2018-03-04 19:07:37 Lathered in @Neutrogena body oil mmmmm 
8631 2018-03-04 19:07:36 Lets build the east/west pipe line and buy our own steel. Use our own oil and put Canadians to work.
8632 2018-03-04 19:07:28 Well , the good news is the pipeline wasn’t sabotaged , it wasn’t “taken hostage” by an aggrieved group & we aren’t witnessing another bout of oil terminal/facilities/pipeline scrums. Should be worked out shortly. My advice to the landowner- don’t accept wooden nickels or Petros.

8637 2018-03-04 19:06:34 Start using 2 tbsp olive oil and vinegar instead of other salad dressings. You'd be surprised how much fat &amp; calories they have.
8638 2018-03-04 19:06:34 i just showered and then put every existent oil in my hair and on my skin kumbaya my lord
8639 2018-03-04 19:06:33 Right? That’s what really drives me crazy. And the only reason they did was someone thought it was leaking oil (ended up being hydraulic fluid). Kind of an important thing that should be part of routine maintenance, don’t ya think? #AmericanAirlinesWoe

8696 2018-03-04 18:59:24 The idea that our tax dollars benefit us instead of subsidizing big oil and raining down bombs on brown people is simply ludicrous, right!?
8697 2018-03-04 18:58:52 You can see the intelligent responses talking about the subject of the article. Maybe canada should start a new tariff on oil, wheat, lumber exports to the US? Charge a major tax on firearm imports? Dumb move by trump and the gop.

8720 2018-03-04 18:55:46 Obama. Oil, I guess
8721 2018-03-04 18:55:29 Ridiculous snobbery from vast majority of the media. Suits them to condemn managers who spend and fail, but never the same narrative when a manager spends oil money and miraculously wins.

8725 2018-03-04 18:55:11 Nice, I am just getting into all of this and all these rules are a bit overwhelming but I crafted a lil regimen for myself. I am excited for what is to come. 

I use a leave in, cream then seal with castor oil.

8727 2018-03-04 18:55:06 Interesting way to do it.  Architects are still putting oil or gas heating systems in highly insulated houses that will be largely redundant yet will still have annual maintenance costs.  Having electrical heating incorporated into MHRV also a good approach.
8728 2018-03-04 18:55:04 Is coconut oil a #superfood? The question was raised on Trust Me I'm a Doctor earlier this year, particularly with reference to #cholesterol levels. It has many benefits, as well as being safe to heat at high temperatures for a length of time, unlike the often used saturated oils
8729 2018-03-04 18:54:59 So I'm trying this castor-oil-on-my-eyebrows thing to see of it'll help them grow. I did not know how thick Castor Oil is

8732 2018-03-04 18:54:49 Meanwhile, back in WA DC, the tRump administration shrinks our monument lands so his buddies can drill for oil instead of seeking clean alternatives.
8733 2018-03-04 18:54:42 Mossadegh was a Prince. A ghajar prince who did not care about oil nationalization nor constitutional monarchy while ghajar were in power. He only got politically active very late in his life when Pahlavi took over. Where was he before the Pahlavi?

8739 2018-03-04 18:53:55 “you don’t use olive oil? so what do you sauté with?”
- hanna nila hasan
8740 2018-03-04 18:53:49 Right, but you can make a similar anecdotal argument with China, too. The deployment of THAAD to SK despite China’s objections, our publicly calling them out for supplying of oil to NK, etc, all are somewhat tougher measures. But don’t amount to a tougher overall strategy.
8741 2018-03-04 18:53:43 He’s not using “oil money” btw. Haven’t done for 4/5 years now. People also need to start educating themselves about how the big clubs in England got their money in the first place, to become successful.
8742 2018-03-04 18:53:25 I don't really follow the rules. I use a leave in then gel. I oil only my scalp with a mixture of castor oil and olive oil.
8743 2018-03-04 18:53:23 I don’t believe YouTube is currently governed by the FCC...I could be wrong, but if they were, I wouldn’t be able to hear swear words on YouTube videos. 

But yes, I would prefer that we don’t censor things. 

Problem is, Infowars is bullshit and a snake oil e-store.

8750 2018-03-04 18:52:45 Worked as a key grip on a sh*tty Irish gangster film in my 20s. Was asked one day to find some 'authentic Italian pictures' to put in the background of a mobster's office.

I found some cheap oil paintings of flowers. It kinda worked and somehow I wasn't sacked.

8762 2018-03-04 18:49:53 Yes I had a saloon. Did 100 miles to a pint of oil. If you were tailgated downhill people soon dropped back when you accelerated again. Used to go Staffordshire and had to stop and put oil in 1/2 way. Those were the days.
8763 2018-03-04 18:49:53 When Him & JR argue over drilling oil on the land...
8764 2018-03-04 18:49:51 I know people talk a lot about the male gaze in films. But that movie is two and a half hours of oil that men in thongs hitting each other with sticks. If there's no female gaze I'm a trained circus seal who learned how to use the internet
8765 2018-03-04 18:49:49 Sure they do exist. They just in the minority

Nigeria is also currently facing 4 months fuel scarcity.

8811 2018-03-04 18:43:54 Socialism isn't what brought Venezuela from relative wealth to relative poverty. Their money was tied up in oil. Oil prices dropped.

8831 2018-03-04 18:42:12 Agreed the “free” market determines the price. The kicker is that rules and regulations set the parameters of the market. 

Just look how OPEC controlled the price of oil for decades. The free market is the grandest myth in capitalism

8863 2018-03-04 18:38:22 Seems to me that you have king of a leftist attitude in your report
The crisis is not a result of falling oil prices, even though that is true the main problem has been cuts in production as well as sale price
Still 1.5M b/d at 30$ p/b is 45MM$ per day, but almost all is stolen

8871 2018-03-04 18:37:11 Never had much truck with whalers myself. I mean the oil gives a nice clean soot-free light, but it seems like a lot of effort to go through for it.

Gasoline was a useless byproduct. Yet, due to more ingenuity something useless was transformed to very useful.

8916 2018-03-04 18:30:50 So what were you using to lube it? Chain oil shouldn't allow a ton of buildup but if it does break cleaner then reapply on occasion

8968 2018-03-04 18:23:41 agreed. The fact the bonds looking to rally (rates falling) but gold is going to underperform suggests that inflation expectations are going to get absolutely hammered down. This indicates to me that oil markets are going to get a real beating in the next few weeks/months

9010 2018-03-04 18:17:18 Main point too, it only effects the 30% imported, local production is ramped up due to increased cost competitiveness. Oil is way more influential in the economy and that has fluctuated 4x in value bottom to top.

9064 2018-03-04 18:07:13 UAE Billionaire 11 versus Russian oil oligarch 11 remains goalless in the English Moneyball final. Curiously zero is also the number of English players on the park. #MCICHE
9065 2018-03-04 18:07:10 Um, why my child out here battling ashy black man syndrome? Here rubbing down himself with baby oil, child!
9066 2018-03-04 18:06:51 City will probably spend another 300m litres of oil this summer
9067 2018-03-04 18:06:14 @BBC6Music #NP6Music The early 90s Britflick Shopping is a terrible film with a disproportionately great soundtrack. Including the amazing Theme by Sabres of Paradise, playing incongruously over the opening titles - aerial shots of oil refineries as I recall. Top tune though....
9068 2018-03-04 18:06:01 I tried oil pulling and guys I'm sorry to report but it just feels like c*m in your mouth
9069 2018-03-04 18:06:00 Melting polar Ice caps? Changing ocean temps?  Geo engineering? EPA scientist fired and replaced by oil tycoons? Fake news?

9074 2018-03-04 18:05:11 Tea tree oil and shea butter
9075 2018-03-04 18:05:07 I remember being called a conspiracy theorist when I said I thought we were there for oil because 0 WMD's were found. Not even a trace.
9076 2018-03-04 18:05:03 uhhh i went to super lube to get my oil changed and now there’s a nail in my tire and it’s going flat what the fuck
9077 2018-03-04 18:05:01 The absolute worst imho is the "cheese" that goes on American cheeseburgers, that kind of orange jelly slab of crude oil.
9078 2018-03-04 18:04:59 No, UAE oil money has.
9079 2018-03-04 18:04:47 My crazy Aunt Patty will just move on to the next snake oil salesman. She did it from Glenn Beck without hesitation.
9080 2018-03-04 18:04:43 Our present rulers sold us into slavery because of Crude Oil. They sold the future away for peanuts
9081 2018-03-04 18:04:20 What a dull game empty seats 2 oil franchise trying to save football haha

9083 2018-03-04 18:03:30 Power Cut Update: we’ve taken in a couple from down the road, so they can bask in the warmth from the oil lamp. They’ve brought a glass bowl and I’m not sure I understand
9084 2018-03-04 18:03:29 dont forget the oil for which the west would go to any extent , monarchy/dictatorship is a necessity for the west to keep the oil flowing
9085 2018-03-04 18:03:14 I gotta change my oil but my bed is rlly just laying there 
9086 2018-03-04 18:02:50 my uncle came to my house in his corvette and he didn’t want to drive it near my oil spill  dramatic
9087 2018-03-04 18:02:47 I always tell my mom when I get my oil changed because she tells me “good girl” and I feel like I’m winning at adulting for 5 minutes 
9088 2018-03-04 18:02:41 Fraudiola with the backing of The FA and Arab oil money we wonder when The FA will be caught for being so corrupt. Don't get it twisted they play terrific football but listen to Conte's press conference before the game.
9089 2018-03-04 18:02:24 I know you aren’t. I didn’t need to see that round anyway.   On to Vegas for the Wills. Safe travels to you friend 
9090 2018-03-04 18:02:07 You know what keeps my face pimple free. My own Tea Tree Oil Soap and if you do manage to get a pimple just dab some Organic Tea Tree Oil on a q-tip and spot treat.
9091 2018-03-04 18:02:07 I feel like if you’ve left out oil and vinegar then that’s most of the dressing you’re not using.

-"No, that's oil. It was a bp spill, not dq. You're looking at the logo upside-down."
9101 2018-03-04 18:00:39 that's like a woman being attracted to a man changing oil/a tire. or doing sum minor plumbing/wiring around the house. someone who can fulfill they role is always gonna be more likeable
9102 2018-03-04 18:00:35 I'm so glad it helped! I love these oils! My son was feeling sick and so I also used Digestzen last night. I love that oil!
9103 2018-03-04 18:00:21 Given his contract, Getting another couple GOOD years out of Sekera is probably the #1 most important thing for the Oil right now
9104 2018-03-04 18:00:19 Eucalyptus and peppermint oil is good to rub on your body after a long stressful day.
9105 2018-03-04 18:00:07 Yep we the people were just hoping someone would come along and pollute our water and air, deregulate banks so we can have another crisis, take away our parks for oil tycoons and destroy our freedoms. STFU, donnie boy. You are a loser!
9106 2018-03-04 17:59:53 Price of oil has significantly increased and yet naira is still shit paper. They are still blaming GEJ. No economic blueprint or road map. Can't wait to kick these charlatans out of govt.

9118 2018-03-04 17:57:26 Deep Blue or Peppermint essential oil has been my life saver for headaches - I've tried the daith piercing, medicine, massage, chiropractic & others but these oils give me instant relief everytime 
9119 2018-03-04 17:57:20 It's vegan spread rather than oil. I've added salt but maybe needs a bit more. I will persevere!!
9120 2018-03-04 17:57:03 You people claim this fraud league is the best in the world. But a team is leading with 18 Points. You deserve to be flogged with oil soaked koboko.
9121 2018-03-04 17:56:57 wait im not sure what youre saying. My point is you shouldnt spread out the 3 unless you have depth. 2 good lines is better than 3 guys being pulled down by their line. Thats how you burn out top players. Id rather Strome be asked to hold the 3rd and free RNH to do his thing.

9123 2018-03-04 17:56:44 US is protecting its interests and Canada must protect its, asap. Canada must get out of reactive to proactive mode to swiftly find other markets or do lobbying with US on other exports. Who knows Oil could be next.
9124 2018-03-04 17:56:27 It's a fight for power of territory, oil and nuclear money! It's not a fight for each and everyone 's stability, safety and prosperity.
9125 2018-03-04 17:56:23 They're delicious! And go with so much. Apparently they're not that hard to make yourself... essentially they're pancake batter baked in lard / oil in the oven, in a muffin tin :) I've always meant to take some back home to Germany , but keeping them frozen is a challenge 
9126 2018-03-04 17:56:21 See if you wash your beauty blenders with a bit of washing up liquid and vegetable oil it gets it aww clean and stain free
9127 2018-03-04 17:56:20 Yea a Genius with an Oil family with Money . You’re damn right
9128 2018-03-04 17:56:07 US imagines future races complete with oil slicks and no wildlife.  Thanks Lisa and #TrumpGOP utin.
9129 2018-03-04 17:55:57 What isn’t obvious to me from the article: Are you shocked/horrified they are “worth” so much already, or impressed? Because I didn’t see anything about product effectiveness or if this is just direct-to-consumer snake oil...
9130 2018-03-04 17:55:29 lmfao! lmk how i literally just got an oil change yesterday
9131 2018-03-04 17:55:28 Is Castor oil good?
9132 2018-03-04 17:55:25 I just hooked up a new gas dryer. The other day I fixed the drawers in the kitchen. Also, gonna change the oil in the truck. Some day I'll make a great husband for the right guy. 
9133 2018-03-04 17:55:15 Actually, the term Cannabis is Legal.. the term Marijuana is illegal.. So u can have Cannabis oil but not marijuana..

9140 2018-03-04 17:54:06 Please stop govt. employment and make all institutions corporations like indian oil corporations. Govt. needs to reduce the facilities to govt. employees since they are mostly misused.
9141 2018-03-04 17:53:47 They may need a bit more because you are not using unsalted butter.  Not sure what to suggest if they go a bit hard.  Maybe try using vegan butter instead of sunflower oil.

9144 2018-03-04 17:53:27 I also need to give my bitch an oil change, I never wait until its due I always get it done a thousand miles in advance
9145 2018-03-04 17:53:03 What a boring match!!! City win the Oil Cup!! #MCICHE
9146 2018-03-04 17:52:59 Wake up, the only people aligned w/Russia are Dems; Trump rebuilding military & breaking oil export records isn't helping them.
9147 2018-03-04 17:52:43 ICE are the gestapo; this would just be what oil firms do on the reg in Latin America and, to some extent, North Dakota.
9148 2018-03-04 17:52:41 There’s still time for the public to weigh in on this if the law suits don’t stop trump first, I know bears ears has oil under it, staircase probably does to. It’s all about oil/gas and putin/RU is world’s #1 gas supplier.. how convenient

9152 2018-03-04 17:52:11 They work for meager wages, rations of food, and shelter... what do you expect? Institutionalized slavery. The very reason they can't find people to work the oil rigs of Venezuela... no true wages due to a depleted economy. 
9153 2018-03-04 17:52:02 Joining you in mutual questioning if why somethings seem important and others aren't. Allowing the CDC to research is an acquiescence to science and data. The GOP won't allow that. God, guns, oil, and natural gas.

9157 2018-03-04 17:51:11 All good and yes, if Talbot posts his typical SV% they're likely a playoff team. Though last yr was different. It was his sv% + making monster stops at critical times in games. Those two combined are pretty damn special.

9162 2018-03-04 17:49:43 I don’t like it either girl it’s rank! Can taste the oil in the chips more than the actual chip itself
9163 2018-03-04 17:49:42 And if we believe you - we still can't balance the books without £13bn fiscal transfer from WM. Indy means debt to GDP of 150% - no currency- no central bank & living under IMF austerity for years to come. BTW Oil & Gas are shot & we'd need to import electricity.

9169 2018-03-04 17:49:14 I took my truck to the dealership just to get an oil change once and they ended up doing a whole bunch of shit to my truck without asking me and charged me 2 grand and I was only expecting to pay $70. Shit was wack. 
9170 2018-03-04 17:49:13 THAT'S the 1st stage? Not EVERY cabinet appt, scotus pick, concessions to oil/gun lobbies, destroying relationships with US allies, or threatening nuclear war?
9171 2018-03-04 17:48:35 Bolivia’s doing OK. Mind you the USA isn’t trying to effect a regime change (yet) and it’s economy didn’,t suffer from the catastrophic fall in the price of oil.

9176 2018-03-04 17:48:00 Jim’s right - Biotech and Oil are very difficult to navigate. Better hedge appropriately if you play that game!
9177 2018-03-04 17:47:59 You’ve obviously been to south east New Mexico. It has oil and looks like west Texas. BTW, there is virtually Nobody who lives in the north section.

9181 2018-03-04 17:47:23 It's a good read.. but the world order is changing so fast, so many factors oil, interest rates, trump-china, trump-Russia, middle-east, other emerging markets and a host of domestic issues for us.. as sales persons stick to basic, India moving forward, good time 2 stay invested
9182 2018-03-04 17:47:06 So, you would rather have the oil transported through the park by rail? How many bridges over pristine streams and rivers to you suppose that oil train would be crossing? Pipeline is the safer way to transport
9183 2018-03-04 17:47:03 Oil based instead of water based maybe?
9184 2018-03-04 17:46:52 Chef McElroy cut up some chocolate, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was chicken, along with toast.
9185 2018-03-04 17:46:50 How many titles again...before the oil money?
9186 2018-03-04 17:46:47 I just feel like with cars there's soooo much. Like, i know a piece of the basics. 

How to change a tire and change my oil. But some of this stuff i just feel like I'm being swindled.
9187 2018-03-04 17:46:46 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
9188 2018-03-04 17:46:24 That’s very true, likely that #matd is above 30 on first spud as the odds are at least one of the four drills will strike oil. That’s the beauty of it, if first drill misses then we are on to the next one, no big drop. If it strikes with 3 more to come it’ll go nutswin win
9189 2018-03-04 17:46:09 Will is the best.

9191 2018-03-04 17:46:04 Your sister is being exploited by an industry with no integrity. Real medicine must be shown to work. "Alternative medicine" is medicine which has either not been shown to work or has been shown NOT to work. It's literally as bad as snake oil.
9192 2018-03-04 17:45:55 You can free them with any type of vegetable oil!
9193 2018-03-04 17:45:52 The ostensible reason for tariffs, national defense, is good too. Remember how we were crippled by the Oil Embargo 40 years ago? Now the globalists are happy seeing us become dependent on overseas suppliers for anything and everything.

9205 2018-03-04 17:43:56 @DCMetroMINIs help! Mini oil light came on - checked oil - bone dry. Anyone know where I can get a quart of the mini synthetic oil today so I can get her to the shop tomorrow?

9209 2018-03-04 17:43:41 My dad helped Blake put oil in his car and gave him 60 bucks just because. Pretty sure he likes him more than he likes me
9210 2018-03-04 17:43:36 Who owns the oil ? Who owns the salmon farms ? Who owns the electricity ?

9216 2018-03-04 17:43:05 "Breaks and oil are done. I went ahead and washed your car for you too. Oh and I'm making French dipped sandwiches for sunday dinner"

Hi guys. I don't deserve my dad.
9217 2018-03-04 17:42:47 darpa. need a foreign enemy to fund the war machine. cant be making friends with other countries that have more oil than we do
9218 2018-03-04 17:42:27 I would start it when the ship is "infected" with the oil/plastic eating microbe and then tell the rest, past-tense, from the MC's perspective. #justaddtea
9219 2018-03-04 17:42:20 When we have RRSPs we don't need a "big government" fund.
No profits= no prosperity.... 
By the way Canada sells its oil at a big discount thanks to anti-pipeline "green" activists... 
9220 2018-03-04 17:42:20 Med-high. I don't use much oil just enough so they don't stick
9221 2018-03-04 17:42:16 Exactly.  What if you could buy your oil in CNY, you would be able to pay for your oil without ever converting to USD, & you wouldn't need USD anymore.  Saves you money, but not good for US.  What does US run surpluses w/world on?  USD's, little else.  Currency mercantilism.
9222 2018-03-04 17:42:04 You don’t seem to have s very high opinion of your fellow Scots? IQ dropping like the price of oil? Oh dear you are a bitter little unionist. I’m sure your side will make sure Queenie, wins the day. They are used to rigging elections.

9227 2018-03-04 17:41:40 @iflycaribbean  Hello, I wonder if I can carry engine oil  (5 x 32oz bottles ) in my checked baggage.  I refered to @TSA for permitted and prohibited items but I didn't find anything. Can you please comfirn it is  OK?  I'm traveinlg from YYZ to CCS.
9228 2018-03-04 17:41:40 But most importantly oil and gas companies and big business right?  All of the people in the 11th benefit from investing in state employees and schools.  Only gas companies benefit from you refusing to tax them and using that money to pay for the investments in the state
9229 2018-03-04 17:41:34 Ah, easy for the corrupt to throw pot shots. Tell us about the $145,000 you took from insurance companies to oppose insurance premium rate regulation, and your investment in a fracking oil company.

9239 2018-03-04 17:39:59 In all honesty, I could care less what Nicholson says about player related expectations. That's not his expertise...hence why he's not a GM. His job is to run the organization & put pieces in place to make it work.
9240 2018-03-04 17:39:53 Very well said. Two different products almost. All this does is reduce the spread between light and heavy crude prices (makes heavy, which is most OPEC oil, relatively more expensive). Problem is that most refineries globally are not configured to process the light shale oil.
9241 2018-03-04 17:39:50 10 dollar Grams of Grohi Sugar Wax!!! Amazing Deals on Oil only @greentherapy_I5_eugene !
9242 2018-03-04 17:39:32 Take half teaspoon of kalonji oil and add it in a cup of green tea... Try it ..., it really works
9243 2018-03-04 17:39:32 I like beetroot crisps myself! Slice thinly, leave to dry, partially microwave, tiny bit of salt & olive oil & finish in the oven.
9244 2018-03-04 17:39:30 This oil money derby is boring as fuck
9245 2018-03-04 17:39:30 i keep repeating myself that it's the slams of last tail whips of late capitalism in its death throes, after which to build a new system people with actual plans will be needed, and these dudes will hopefully have been exposed as the far right snake oil peddlers they are

9250 2018-03-04 17:39:13 I need to get my hair done. I need an oil change. I need a new workout clothes. I need a car wash. I need about $20,000
9251 2018-03-04 17:39:02 For some reason my pot of stew kept swelling till it spilled oil on the electric cooker and that caught fire.

The spirit of the Ghanaian fire fighter in that video descended on me and I used my towel to tie wrapper for the fire.

That sorted it but I need a new towel.

9253 2018-03-04 17:38:41 We need to stop all shipments of oil by Pipeline Rail or Oil Tankers we must stop developing fossil fuels totally - We have to reduce Global Warming and Climate Change that mean immediate change to Sustainable Solar Wind Tidal & Geothermal
9254 2018-03-04 17:38:31 I am fairly certain that Kevin De Bruyne is a robot specifically made for football. If you cut him, he’ll bleed oil.
9255 2018-03-04 17:38:28 Had it for 2 years, tried everything: warm compress, steam treatment (cleaning before and after), black seed oil - you name it. Eventually had two removed (on the same eye) w/ surgery and one went away itself
9256 2018-03-04 17:38:23 Do all girls not use lotion/oil after they shower??
9257 2018-03-04 17:38:22 Oh Rig as in Oil Rig. Or you could do A for Aye. Z cd be Edinburgh Zoo. x
9258 2018-03-04 17:38:03 What will happen is all the zinc coating will melt off the first time you use it. It then rusts and in 3 years will be useless. A local farmer gave me an oil barrel which he drilled holes in as vents instead. Cost, 3 bottles of beer.
9259 2018-03-04 17:38:03 5. When u stop Canadian oil/ gas development/exports, you are supporting a country that put GP in prison for protesting, countries with terrible human rights & enviro records, and putting Canadian workers out of work and no improvement to overall enviro

9265 2018-03-04 17:36:48 I’m waiting on my oil change and this lady is watching the news on her phone. She keeps laughing and calling Trump a “Stupid A**”. I keep trying hard not to laugh.

9267 2018-03-04 17:36:39 Did you hear Nicholson last night? He's expecting Talbot to be at the same level. Expects him to "bounce back" next season.

9281 2018-03-04 17:35:01 Where did you buy almond oil?
9282 2018-03-04 17:34:58 I’m not in the business of explaining coverage of particular stories 4 years ago.  I’m neither a journalist nor a fan of conspiracy theories. I recall some oil reserves estimates in 2014 - think they were higher than the revised ones last week. The move away from carbon has begun
9283 2018-03-04 17:34:56 As I said, everything went perfect last year, if you were expecting Talbot to be at that same level, shame on you. Better than this sure but he's not a top 5 goalie. My man, this team is nearly 20 pts out of the playoffs...that's not just goaltending.
9284 2018-03-04 17:34:43 Canada has said they will retaliate.  Watch your gas go up as a result of increased oil prices, electricity sky rocket due to tariffs and building a deck on your house almost double because of increases on soft lumber.  40% of US trade is with Canada.  Get your pocket books ready

9291 2018-03-04 17:34:03 Credit where credit is due, compared to other teams backed by oil rich states, this is as good as you will see.

9295 2018-03-04 17:33:27 Russia was asked for their help in Syria. The USA is their illegally. Regime change for Oil and Resources....the USA motto.
9296 2018-03-04 17:33:22 Roman Abramovich has been humbled. He thought he was rich. Bet he didn't see the Arabian oil moguls coming. #MCIvCHE
9297 2018-03-04 17:33:17 No, that is in an of itself bad economics. 

That is how insurance should work, but we do not have insurance, we have healthcare subscriptions. 

Car insurance does not pay for oil changes, wiper blades, brakes or even transmissions. It pays for accidents. Lower risks pay less.

9301 2018-03-04 17:32:30 Were they not a source of contention for they’re play this year? Not an Oil fan, so just asking. That was the impression social media gave.
9302 2018-03-04 17:32:07 Ohh ok haha 
9303 2018-03-04 17:32:00 not in terms of system but in terms of Oil, sry, money
9304 2018-03-04 17:31:51 Same thing with the new Coconut oil trend. People think it’s healthier but it’s not. It actually has almost as much fat as butter, just not an animal product. Olive oil is still the best choice there is!!
9305 2018-03-04 17:31:49 Texas doesn’t have to separate their oil from sand. Being full of shit isn’t mandatory by the way, you could do better.
9306 2018-03-04 17:31:46 I had barbecue in Texas once. THAT is not barbecue. It’s cheap New York snake oil in the form of something that resembles food.

9312 2018-03-04 17:30:53 What was Bill Mahers response?
9313 2018-03-04 17:30:52 That's on the heels of reports finding that the singular reason Trump reduced size of Bears Ears was because of oil and gas exploration. Energy companies wanted to exploit the land and Trump wanted to override Obama decision to preserve land sacred to Native Americans.

9320 2018-03-04 17:30:08 I hope so. Pep might have other ideas but I have little time for oil money investment and what it’s doing to the game so I hope not.

9322 2018-03-04 17:29:48 To be fair, back up goalies is an issue with this regime only. The last one had no problem with that. It was the rest of the roster that was the issue & made it difficult for a guy to be a legit No.1

However, I am not obliged to use either currency more than fleetingly, swtching into and out of francs with frictionless ease, as I wish

9333 2018-03-04 17:27:54 The thing is, it is even "wronger" than it looks. The big "cheat" of OPEC is to produce a lot of condensates, OPEC definition is API above 50 (which would put shale oil as condensate). Total OPEC condensate around 7 mboe/d.

9343 2018-03-04 17:26:45 I would trust a snake oil salesman more at this point in time...
9344 2018-03-04 17:26:12 Yes. Our dog has seizures. Used to be once a month but now he has them about once a year. I definitely think it’s the oil.
9345 2018-03-04 17:26:07 I hate the Green Party...they said Trump would be no worse than Clinton. Anyone who votes Green Party is a shill for big oil and polluters.
9346 2018-03-04 17:26:07 The orange head ? Its jimin I think
9347 2018-03-04 17:26:02 This Lavender, Tea Tree, and Peppermint combination I put in my oil diffuser smells pretty good. I'm enjoying it, the sound of this basketball game (my back is to the TV), and editing this podcast.
9348 2018-03-04 17:25:48 You must be doing pretty well for yourself. I've been forced to use elbow grease as my knuckle oil.
9349 2018-03-04 17:25:47 Amazing people still listen to this snake oil salesman
9350 2018-03-04 17:25:44 My hair is def needing a coconut oil treatment.
9351 2018-03-04 17:25:37 I suspect there will be more of that as Chiarelli continues to trade away skill for character. I don't see this getting better. I really need to separate myself from this team. 
9352 2018-03-04 17:25:26 See that new oil field of over 2,800,000,000 barrels of oil, well, if all those barrels were stacked like a pyramid it would be the size of Ben Lomond. If the oil is extracted at a rate of 50,000 barrels a day , every day, it will last for 153 years.
9353 2018-03-04 17:25:25 Yes! The further we get away from our dependency on oil the better!
9354 2018-03-04 17:25:16 Gas oil en France 1.35€,je viens du Luxembourg gas oil 1.02€,  moins taxé qu'en France, petites questions à nos dirigeants le gas oil luxembourgeois pollue moins que le gas oil français? Le Luxembourg n'est pas concerné par la pollution ? Gouvernement de voleur !! Honteux
9355 2018-03-04 17:25:09 What? You are 55? Wow, obviously the brain starts to deteriorate quite rapidly after a certain age, I better start taking fish oil.
9356 2018-03-04 17:25:06 Did you give him the oil or treats?
9357 2018-03-04 17:25:02 In fact this solar wall could trigger a oil glut and bring about a welcomed drop in the price of oil.
9358 2018-03-04 17:25:02 Could I sneak in on Tuesday first thing? Please. I've an oil leak, it's started other past few days, and I commute to Derby for work now. Wanted to see how serious it is, chief.
9359 2018-03-04 17:25:00 Decided to keep my beard this time, after it had grown for about 6 weeks already. 2 weeks later, with regular conditioning, oil and balm it's finally softening. Now I just need to ride out the awkward length phase 
9360 2018-03-04 17:24:47 Boiling oil poured on his head, castrated, his head split open’. Ghastly murder of 21-year-old Paresh Mesta in coastal Karnataka. #Ask4SafeKarnataka

9362 2018-03-04 17:24:39 You stack your top six when the depth is lacking elsewhere on the roster. When that was the case in SJ he stacked his T6 and should have. With that said, if Sharks had a better G and D those teams likely win some of those series.
9363 2018-03-04 17:24:37 This Cantu leave-in with argan oil smells so good!
9364 2018-03-04 17:24:32 Come on cook bacon in oil
9365 2018-03-04 17:24:28 Both oils are great for standard cooking with Rapeseed slightly better for high temps, but I think that it depends on whether you use Virgin/Extra Virgin etc, both very healthy oils though
9366 2018-03-04 17:24:24 @LetterKong ทำไมเจ้าทำกับข้าเยี่ยงนี้ 
9367 2018-03-04 17:24:23 "I mean, what's more New York than an espresso rub?"

"Oysters."

"I...um, that doesn't—"

"Oil cakes? Taffy apples? Pigs roaming the streets?"

". . ."

"Don't worry. I'm sure *squints* coffee is very, er, New York."
9368 2018-03-04 17:24:17 So does this mean The Liberal government will sell out to the American environmentalist backed American/Saudi oil corporations to get them back in again? So what really was discussed behind closed doors in New York when McKenna went there?
9369 2018-03-04 17:24:12 #mining $GLD #energy #economy $ES $OIL INN_Resource prochile_ca There definitely are a lot of interesting things to see! Enjoy!
9370 2018-03-04 17:24:11 Does anyone have experience in giving CDB oil to a dog with Cancer?
9371 2018-03-04 17:24:08 Imagine goin to make breakfast nd pourin maple syrup instead of oil 
9372 2018-03-04 17:24:05 1) Global monopoly of USD pricing of oil/commodities = ccy mercantilism.  If exporters free to settle oil/comms in any currency they wish = global +.  
2)  Yes, the BIS said in Nov-16 a weaker USD would increase global wealth as real value of USD-denom debt overhang fell, eg 2017
9373 2018-03-04 17:24:05 Ca sticks together! We can & must win & take back our Country from Koch's & OIL Industry! Their hell bent on distroying this country! Think about it! 2 Brothers who inherited their  distroying Democrocy!They are evil & must be stopped at any cost! They're stealing@crwaxlax

9380 2018-03-04 17:23:15 don’t sleep on moroccan oil. my hair felt like a saltine CRACKER a few weeks ago and now it’s shiny and so soft!!!
9381 2018-03-04 17:22:59 I’m serious, people will eventually file a class action against them... I saw an interview and someone equated it to letting you build a house on free land and then tearing down your house... they will get sued eventually. In perfect state to do it, right @PGutierrez630
9382 2018-03-04 17:22:45 That is exactly what is going to be litigated. Oh, if AT&T and Standard Oil, were too big so they were broken up, what do you think will happen to Facebook, Google and Twitter? Hmmm
9383 2018-03-04 17:22:42 What’s the meaning of this?
9384 2018-03-04 17:22:32 Fry it..with olive oil and add small chopped garlic
9385 2018-03-04 17:22:12 Till this day I can smell Just For Me relaxers, Luster’s Pink Oil Lotion, Blue Magic, and the burning hot comb. Still traumatized by my relaxed days as a child.
9386 2018-03-04 17:22:06 Funny we have more oil we ship to the US for refining then pay more at the pump than Americans. Might be time to just stop providing it to you in crude form we refine and charge you more at the pump.
9387 2018-03-04 17:22:02 Seen this body oil that would take me from a 10 to a solid 12 but homegirl gotta be smoking kangaroo dicks If she thought she was getting $120 for a 2 oz bottle .
9388 2018-03-04 17:22:01 I’m going to buy tea tree oil
9389 2018-03-04 17:22:01 Pro tip: don’t throw cayenne pepper directly into hot oil. It only takes doing this once to learn.
9390 2018-03-04 17:21:46 Heard about the big transfer mate, congrats and the best of luck. Midnight Oil to headline the F1 and AFL Grand Final in Dubai...
9391 2018-03-04 17:21:46 Hiro nori has best chashu, and get the black garlic oil. Kitakata ban nai in Costa Mesa has the best broth, and Japanese fried chicken!
9392 2018-03-04 17:21:44 at minimum, if the #Oilers had league average goaltending, they'd be a playoff team.
9393 2018-03-04 17:21:39 Oil
9394 2018-03-04 17:21:36 Oh btw might need to buy a new engine for my car.. well see if the oil pan leaves any aluminum behind
9395 2018-03-04 17:21:22 Do you know how much the West has F'ed with Iran, historically? They didn't have Ayatollahs, they elected a secular guy in a suit & tie in 1953 & "we" overturned their election to serve oil interests. "We" installed The Shah, etc. etc. etc. Go back a bit..
9396 2018-03-04 17:21:18 Almond oil mixed with rose water makes my skin glow and my booty feel like cotton ooooh

9401 2018-03-04 17:21:03 ok now thanks
9402 2018-03-04 17:20:47 If we call it even and go somewhere down the middle, what is this group? A middling playoff team but certainly not a Cup contender. And yet many act as if the Oilers are. All comes back to reasonable expectations of the group.
9403 2018-03-04 17:20:32 Meanwhile our @EPAScottPruitt denies Climate Change AND Evolution. Not certain where he believes his beloved Oil came from. @realDonaldTrump raises ten little middle fingers to America and the World.
9404 2018-03-04 17:20:27 Bony canopies beneath black knee-deep oil and are immensely hot
9405 2018-03-04 17:20:26 Exactly...Kuwait got hit hard. Saudia Arabia and other countries have at least begun to attempt to diversify. Their economies were hit hard, but oil was like 30% of their GDP not the 60% it was in Venezuela. Oil was 97.7 percent of their exports...that's excessive.
9406 2018-03-04 17:20:16 Sounds promising 
9407 2018-03-04 17:20:12 GOP attempted to spread ‘democracy’ at the point of a gun in return for the extraction of oil in 2003. They’ve gotten wiser: just use the financial and gov’tal machinery of the world’s greatest power to do the same thing and get paid by RU for making sure it benefits.

9411 2018-03-04 17:19:46 Huh. Who knew all this time that olive oil is the one for my hair.
9412 2018-03-04 17:19:42 Nothing says “invest in health” quite like partially hydrogenated palm kernel oil with tristearate and acetylated monoglycerides
9413 2018-03-04 17:19:38 Erm... I'm not aware there are any joys of America? Unless you mean millions out of work, 5g mobile radiation zapping, gmos, mass shootings (ff or not) 22 trn debt, crap food, massive cost of med insurance, and oh yes, plundering foreign countries for oil. (mid East especially)
9414 2018-03-04 17:19:35 Ever wonder why there is silence from Russia about anything Canadian? Putin is thrilled with what the Liberals are doing. Butts & Trudeau are taking  right where Putin wants us. He wants increased sovereignty & the vast oil reserves in the Arctic.
9415 2018-03-04 17:19:35 That oil sounds interesting, I'd probably be up for trying it :) thank you!
9416 2018-03-04 17:19:32 get ready to pay a lot more for electric power fresh water and oil if the pipeline is still a go but I don't think so

9418 2018-03-04 17:19:19 Oil coming from Laneside, and  along Muxton Lane, please drive carefully.
9419 2018-03-04 17:19:14 You newfies? I don’t like your derogatory tone. We are all Canadians no? Did I say I was against oil? I did not. Remove me from this thread and do not tweet me again terry
9420 2018-03-04 17:19:11 Why wouldn’t domestic steel and aluminum production not be of strategic importance, economically or defensively? If oil, why not S&A?

9423 2018-03-04 17:18:43 News of shararah #oil in murzug basen of #Libya field closed. If confirmed this would be the second major field shut in past 10 days knocking off a total of over 350k barrels of oil production daily
9424 2018-03-04 17:18:42 And a billion pounds of oil money.
9425 2018-03-04 17:18:14 I think you could be right - a lot of oil seems to be vacating the engine at an alarming rate! Can't do anything about it till tomorrow, probably won't be driving anywhere at the moment, I'm no expert but I believe oil is fairly essential... :)
9426 2018-03-04 17:18:01 Little league= another season of murdering potatoes and frying their lil carcasses in hot oil.
9427 2018-03-04 17:18:00 Plenty of blame to go around but I don't understand why it's so difficult for fans to accept last year was about as good as that roster could muster. Almost everything went their way & this yr has been the opposite.
9428 2018-03-04 17:17:58 It’s now illegal for companies to market cannabis derived cbd for dogs but my co worker says she gets hemp derived cbd oil for her dog from the farmers market! Unsure of which one. I could find out

9432 2018-03-04 17:17:40 cats cant rly taste stuff but the spiciness might mess up their digestive systems regardless so!! pet with caution lol

ps the spiciness comes from the oil of the chili, which can cling to a cat's fur which the cat will then ingest when it grooms itself
9433 2018-03-04 17:17:39 duh they NEED the money; that "oil & gas trust" is less than 6 figures a year and that skincare line barely breaks even #RHOD

9435 2018-03-04 17:17:26 I'm the Same, I can't handle anything anymore. That's why I just cook my meals with olive oil. It has helped me so much more.

9447 2018-03-04 17:16:12 Have you tried to put a whole bunch in the airfryer?  It doesn’t come out too bad.  Although it loses the flavour of the oily goodness of frying in oil!
9448 2018-03-04 17:16:12 Yeah I had to take the oil sheen because he started spraying it on his forehead He's now watching Arthur and coloring lol
9449 2018-03-04 17:16:02 Is how much oil dey need
9450 2018-03-04 17:16:00 Well, I was REPLYING to you.

Not tagging you in the reply would as pointless as ... an oil temperature information without any hint on the maximum acceptable temperature! :P
9451 2018-03-04 17:15:54 Cool, oil companies pitting nations against each other to see who’ll destroy local environments faster and cheaper. What’s new?
9452 2018-03-04 17:15:45 If I ever had a food blog, it would go like this: tried to eat some good for you stuff, once I had smothered the quinoa/leeks in olive oil, peanut butter, cheese and toasted sunflower seeds it was tolerable.

9456 2018-03-04 17:15:24 He had a shabby shoddy long career in public dis-service, having long ago shabbily shoddily sold out to big oil & other anti-environment anti-Indigenous groups. Can't imagine why you were flummoxed.
9457 2018-03-04 17:15:13 Thank you Only if we could get the oil embargo as well That way the flow of money to the dictador and his group will stop
9458 2018-03-04 17:14:47 for the cheese i make a roux (heat oil, add flour and whisk til paste-y), add nondairy milk, vegetable broth, nondairy cheese, nooch, garlic n onion powder, salt n pepper, turmeric, paprika, and a small splash of acv  i dont use measurement bc i take a soulful approach
9459 2018-03-04 17:14:47 15th biggest oil producer in the world.
9460 2018-03-04 17:14:36 more & more hacks to maintain. if I had to do it again (am zerocarb now so all irrelevant) I would 1. cut out coconut oil 2. definitely not lower protein to the lower suggested keto ranges
9461 2018-03-04 17:14:36 จะแจกงานคอนด้วย หวังว่าจะได้เจอกันคะ
9462 2018-03-04 17:14:27 Yeah I don't even know anymore Rob. Can we say it's just roster construction when much of the same core as last year is still here? 
I'm just frustrated when I see certain coaching decisions happen. Is it all coaching - no. Are the coaches partially responsible? I think so.
9463 2018-03-04 17:14:07 It was... all the oil is in hands of Russians and Chinese now. Their Vice-President is a Muslim from Iraq (his uncle was from Ba’ath party, of Sadam Hussein)... can u imagine what will happen (and it is happening) to the Venezuelan population right now?! And no one to help them.
9464 2018-03-04 17:14:06 For healthy shiny hair use a hot oil treatment once a week.
9465 2018-03-04 17:13:48 Oooh, i saw the mention of udo's oil in the sos food plan! Totally gonna get some next time i go to whole foods. Thanks so much for everything you do. 
9466 2018-03-04 17:13:46 Some header just walked in the back door of my house, turned off the oil heating, left the house and drove away!
9467 2018-03-04 17:13:11 1. Coco oil + paprika sprinkled roasted aub 
2. Fried shrooms + bell pepper + chilli pepper 
3. Diced avo 
4. Quorn BBQ strips 
 Best eva #vegan
9468 2018-03-04 17:13:09 That MO of being one of the better teams in the NHL year after year. Not the best but pretty damn good. Definitely something a head coach wouldn't want on his resume.
9469 2018-03-04 17:13:03 The amount of energy they spend in efforts to be so wrong, and so dangerous in spreading false information, amazes me.  If only they took half as much energy to learn from actual, easier to find, verify, & understand #science, instead of woo brand nonGMO weird essential oil scams
9470 2018-03-04 17:12:56 I will pray for you. Ngiwalahlile mina. At least get a thermometer and make sure the oil is hot enough to shock the devil
9471 2018-03-04 17:12:50 I think he may leave Syria if we and ME allies flood the mkt with oil driving price down.
9472 2018-03-04 17:12:44 pipes going onto site ,are for doing pipes going out ,are done already
9473 2018-03-04 17:11:53 What you say I think is true but there are sanctions against Russia they want lifted and the Magnitsky Act to consider and opening up the Arctic Circle to oil and gas drilling.  So much to consider, so much we don't know.
9474 2018-03-04 17:11:45 Went to go get my oil changed. The mechanic goes “okay, it’s a Honda right?”. Lol I left.
9475 2018-03-04 17:11:44 This Shea Butter and Coconut Oil is doing my skin so much better and this Aloe Vera Gel
9476 2018-03-04 17:11:42 Your voices are really fucking up everything. You're forever ungrateful.
9477 2018-03-04 17:11:39 I dropped my car off to get a oil change and walked to the ER killed two birds with one stone
9478 2018-03-04 17:11:38 Refined Oil
9479 2018-03-04 17:11:30 Am I to spend the grocery money and then starve

-sloshes cuticle oil around in wine glass- “an excellent vintage!”
9480 2018-03-04 17:11:24 Best side in a generation, if not ever, “big six” opponents, and still empty seats scattered everywhere. God I hate Oil Money #MCICHE
9481 2018-03-04 17:11:20 Maine Rd City in the shit, City asked for sponsorship from the Gallagher bros guess what 0, so when Liam turns up, remember ur oil money
9482 2018-03-04 17:11:03 am sure it will take prayers and Anointing oil from TB Joshua to change that character if at all its real.
9483 2018-03-04 17:10:49 We at @LFC aren’t oil rich
9484 2018-03-04 17:10:49 These guys aren't children. I know it's hard for some to accept but the coach's job isn't to motivate his players, that's on them. And as I've said countless times, motivation/effort isn't the Oilers problem.
9485 2018-03-04 17:10:48 Do we have to remove our makeup first before oil cleansing or just use the cleansing oil to remove our make up and normal facial wash afterwards?
9486 2018-03-04 17:10:37 Tillerson & Putin were 2 start drilling 4 oil but its still not plausible. Sanctions aren't lifted. Tillerson sold out with DT although he & Putin have been friend(s) for many years. Each 1 will sell the other 1 out. Jareds position was 2 earn money 2 pay his loans. He's fuqqed
9487 2018-03-04 17:10:33 Facts matter: Russia & OPEC benefit greatly from stupid trade war-why? Need steel to make enough pipelines for domestic oil transport. Steel prices will go up & cannot be built fast enough. US will return to depending on foreign sources- yep, Trump’s good pal Putin & OPEC.
9488 2018-03-04 17:10:17 Yes, it is indeed a large oil filter.
9489 2018-03-04 17:10:17 I have a serious obsession with moroccan oil

9493 2018-03-04 17:09:51 Nuclear fusion power plants, not fission ones. Clean electric that's what the usa needs to be funding not more coal and oil!! @realDonaldTrump
9494 2018-03-04 17:09:47 Eggplant grilled in oil, slathered with hoisin, garlic, fresh ginger. red chili flakes, rice wine vinegar, soy sauce is the food of the gods. I understand why anyone would investigate it thoroughly.
9495 2018-03-04 17:09:19 Wouldn’t that even be common sense really because women would have the bigger audience wanting to watch  so it would make sense that women get paid more

9500 2018-03-04 17:08:30 Honestly! I spent over 30 min cleaning it and sanitizing it and it now holds my olive oil. I would rather have a refund or gift card. I’ll DM you my receipt.

9502 2018-03-04 17:08:14 Saudi Arabia is a protectorate and creation of UK since Sykes Picot. A client vassal state exporting oil and extremism.

But you wont win fuck all - toby will be the first of your player exodus.

Then will see what happens, as youve seen with us moving to a new stadium doesnt compete with oil money.

Esepcially with all the debt
9505 2018-03-04 17:07:57 <living bottle of olive oil
9506 2018-03-04 17:07:43 Great article. Imo most of what Russia does is to drive up oil price including recent Nuke chatter. Putin wants 200 bbl oil he likes to spend on building his popularity imo and oil is a large part of his revenue. Dangerous environment but MattisTillerson to much for him.
9507 2018-03-04 17:07:38 I will help you identify the reasons why humans, animals and our environment are sick.
1. Oil
2. Dow Chemicals 
3. Monsanto 
Oil is a deadly toxin and we've seen the effects on humans , animals and our environment.
Chemical fertilizers ingested over time are toxic poison.
9508 2018-03-04 17:07:33 Still don't understand why so many complain about McLellan's teams in San Jose. Yes, they never won a Cup but they were routinely beat by better teams & goaltenders come playoff time. Regular season success doesn't guarantee you a Cup.
9509 2018-03-04 17:07:32 Emily gets full of oil and then she puts the oil back into her stomach and she waits for herself and feel refueled.

9517 2018-03-04 17:06:31 @kfc @kfcusa utterly disappointed. Chicken Oozing oil, ZERO crunch. More dark brown than the usual golden. Felt like leftovers refried. #KFC #KentuckyFriedChicken
9518 2018-03-04 17:06:26 No. Coffee and coconut oil or French grass-fed butter. That’s it. Collagen protein defeats the purpose for me. It spikes insulin, so feel hunger within a couple of hours.
9519 2018-03-04 17:06:06 Try some DIY mixture with natural ingredients like Aloe vera and coconut oil. When you get out shower, apply Shea butter on wet skin cause it will help seal in moisture water gives.
9520 2018-03-04 17:05:54 We have no examples of socialism gone good . East Germany vs West Germany , North Korea vs South Korea , China vs Taiwan , the list goes on . Norway is a horrible example they sell lots of oil on the capitalist market and severely limit immigration.
9521 2018-03-04 17:05:53 Same, the process of painting is this weird mix of infuriating yet cathartic. 

When we're feeling more confident and have a bit more time, I'll bring my oil paints 8D
9522 2018-03-04 17:05:44 Every engine oil of a vehicle is dew for servicing.
9523 2018-03-04 17:05:41 Thanks. I’m getting on board, my Mom always has one on in our living. So I’ve gotten used it, and have my own oil myself- a lavendar pillow spray.
9524 2018-03-04 17:05:22 Brilliant! I love the Midnight Recovery Oil so sure this is a fantastic product too!  #RTtoWin #SundayFunday #Giveaway
9525 2018-03-04 17:05:22 The Auto industry could stop producing gas cars today. They could easily go fully electric this instant. Why not? Because people like Trump gets paid by coal miners and oil executives not progressives who care about common good.
9526 2018-03-04 17:05:12 Yeah wtf D: oil change should be like, 35$
9527 2018-03-04 17:05:07 My aunt and I mixed like oil and water. She thought I was a 'wild child'. She was very inhibited person. a reason to get sanctimonious. But she was intrigued with my reasoning sometimes.
9528 2018-03-04 17:05:04 Making roast potatoes for the first time ever! I know that seems ridiculous but I've just always bought them! But seeing as they are slathered in oil and salt I'm giving making my own a go for the first time. Keep your fingers crossed that they are edible!

Trans Mountain in leaderless abyss. Oil land locked. India now gnarling teeth. Blame Trump? No, blame our current multiple federal idiocy.
9537 2018-03-04 17:04:12 Butts: passionately hates all things conservative. Despite the term blip with Notley, Alberta is staunchly Conservative.  Also the centre of  oil & gas development. Butts is one of the biggest green beanies in Canada, supports any & all efforts to shut down pipelines, etc..

9549 2018-03-04 17:02:57 I wonder how strong the correlation between API rating of the oil and CO2 emissions intensity of the field.
9550 2018-03-04 17:02:56 Of all the oil we mine. How much is being recycled? You would think eventually, mining wouldn't be needed as we continue to recycle more unfortunately the oil we mine is how gasoline is made. It will be a while as gasoline cant be recycled.

9555 2018-03-04 17:02:20 Why common Indians don't realize that you get the ruler the way you are. He soled you same snake oil because you wanted the same snake oil. Until the collective psyche of Indians change it will not happen.
9556 2018-03-04 17:02:03 So how do you explain wall to wall coverage of "oil running out" in 2014 followed by numerous reports of huge new finds since then?

9563 2018-03-04 17:01:36 A big oil company has applied to start drilling for oil in Leith Hill in the Surrey Hills -  right in the heart of Southern England.  It would set a dangerous precedent for other landscapes at risk from dirty energy exploration.

9567 2018-03-04 17:01:21 Norway gets >50% of its gov revenue from oil and gas.  Pays for many social programs.

US calls that disgusting?  Cause we'd rather hand billions of dollars annually to Mideast countries & use oil like gluttens, rather then develop our resources to subsidize our social programs
9568 2018-03-04 17:01:14 If we stop drilling and producing oil, we will have less petroleum for manufacturing plastics, with less plastic available we will see less used for disposables and therefore less plastic trash in the oceans, soil, nanoparticles in our lungs, the food we eat, the food animals eat

9570 2018-03-04 17:00:51 You lie and sell snake oil for a living. Maybe, instead of whining, you should soul-search and do something that's right and good for a change. Be honest. Admit what you do and begin undoing the damage you cause.

9590 2018-03-04 16:58:50 well this is what I think Canada should   place about 50% on tariffs on the electric power and fresh water and oil we send to the US because we know you need it
9591 2018-03-04 16:58:48 Hey, Canada, if you want to be a real dick about the steel tariffs you’ll just flood the softwood lumber market, creating domestic lumber jobs.  Hurting US jobs more and forcing the removal of tariffs on the steel and aluminum industry.   You’d also increase oil exports.
9592 2018-03-04 16:58:43 This is also the reason bear cubs can be hunted. Why other national preservations are on the chopping block. Itl all come out. The oil gas and coal that is.

9607 2018-03-04 16:57:25 The same thing happened to me when I went to valvoline for the first couple of oil changes. They will say you need special oil that’s overpriced and convince you to replace parts that don’t actually need replaced. I walked out with a $150 bill once and I never went back.

9616 2018-03-04 16:55:36 Lovely 100% Support exxonmobil is an oil producing global company, excel in oil sector, i am interested to work with exxonmobil to explore my talent as hydraulic pressure hose mechanic, if i am given the opportunity
9617 2018-03-04 16:55:30 Oh nice. Thank you. I need an oil change 
9618 2018-03-04 16:55:25 The management mafia. I haven’t seen any Oilers fans on McDavid yet...lots of haters out there but are there actual legit Oilers fans hating on Connor?
9619 2018-03-04 16:55:25 Fuck man city cheating cunts with their oil money buying the league. Still sexual to watch them play
9620 2018-03-04 16:55:21 Vitamin E oil ladies  spread the word! Pure and strong, best way to get rid of stretch marks - fact! X
9621 2018-03-04 16:55:15 Oil of Ulay
9622 2018-03-04 16:55:14 Good luck! At least there is no castor oil involved!
9623 2018-03-04 16:55:10 Also, let's not ignore the fact 97 & 29 are pretty good together. Again, this decision has little to do with the team's struggle.
9624 2018-03-04 16:54:37 The rate at which arsenal we going down we'll soon discover oil #coyg #BHAARS
9625 2018-03-04 16:54:37 I heard tea tree oil helps . But I’m sure you have all the remedies
9626 2018-03-04 16:54:36 temperature and oil!!!
9627 2018-03-04 16:54:22 She looks like an oil painting! 
9628 2018-03-04 16:54:21 I feel like the in shower lotion from Nivea works but I sill but in lotion or an oil after I get out
9629 2018-03-04 16:54:12 Or the oil slippy G slipped on and cost you title 
9630 2018-03-04 16:53:59 These days, you'd probably have to find a 'generic snake oil' salesman, and he'd probably demand to see your prescription card.

#justgivemethefrickindrugsalready
9631 2018-03-04 16:53:51 Yes it's the stubbornness of the head coach...nothing to do with s poorly constructed roster. Regardless if it's RNH or Draisaitl, the fact he has to use them as much as he does inside the top six tells you all you need to know.
9632 2018-03-04 16:53:43 Peppermint oil!
9633 2018-03-04 16:53:33 Change the oil in my car.  #ThingsIdRatherDoThanWatchTheOscars
9634 2018-03-04 16:53:29 @OGXBeauty do you guys have a color refreshing product for when hair color starts to fade? All I can find so far is the Orchid color protect oil. Also the lavender one won’t work since mine is brown 
9635 2018-03-04 16:53:26 I went on a bread making course and used the one she gave me. Very simple, 500g strong flour, yeast, salt oil and water, knead, prove, knead, prove, bake.
9636 2018-03-04 16:53:26 Oh no! Most places will charge you insane amounts for just an oil change, but there are professional mechanic shops who will do it for $20-$30. Call and ask about oil change prices before you make a commitment.
9637 2018-03-04 16:53:03 Oil from unallocated source. What they really have a minister of magic.
9638 2018-03-04 16:52:40 In the back of the church hitting that oil pen I’m so close to god.
9639 2018-03-04 16:52:33 Yup! Also... for waterproof mascara, olive oil ;)
9640 2018-03-04 16:52:32 The problem with steak is I love to cook it in cast iron but I never keep a high smoke point oil on hand so I have to open the windows cause it gets super smoky.
9641 2018-03-04 16:52:28 Your racism and misandry may be a leading cause for your lower pay. You pat penis on the back for a living, toots.
9642 2018-03-04 16:52:16 Why should a party with green credentials want to extract filthy oil from anywhere when they cannot accept fracking? Fracking is used to extract it from off-shore so that's OK then?
9643 2018-03-04 16:52:10 Oh Texas.  They’ll fix that.  Can’t be getting any blue in there.  Big oil won’t allow it.
9644 2018-03-04 16:51:54 Men at the oil change always trying to get you to buy extra shit. GET OUT MY FACE
9645 2018-03-04 16:51:45 Tip is to never wash your Yorkshire pudding tin.
Preheat it with oil at about 220oC fan. Recipe 1/2 egg per pudding eg: 12 puddings = 6 eggs, Measure all ingredients by volume equal to the volume of your beaten egg! Add a good pinch of salt and don’t cook anything else in oven.
9646 2018-03-04 16:51:27 Prices are rising but no one has even hinted that the rise in price is due to  a shortage. So supply and demand doesn't matter any more. It's just , raise the price when Oil companies want more money.
9647 2018-03-04 16:51:27 @LAYS I want to bring it to your notice that the chips American style cream and onion flavour having batch no. N1090118 which I bought today in New Delhi. It smelt awful I think it's because of oil used or something else.
Please keep check on your quality control.
9648 2018-03-04 16:51:23 @jkenney If you call the remains of tar sands - yes tar sands not oil sands-  responsible resource extraction I shudder to think what irresponsible extraction would be.
9649 2018-03-04 16:51:22 @YungFlyyFlashhy ... breh im never buying a car from @_igenC .. never follows up, never responds, never sets up oil changes for me like he said he would.. ace im ur new custy.. lmao
9650 2018-03-04 16:51:14 No equipment, I just melt coconut oil, beeswax and cocoa butter together and add essential oils for a moisturizer! Or if I’m feeling lazy I just use coconut oil and essential oils!

9652 2018-03-04 16:51:05 If there were natural resources in Antarctica, Europeans would’ve exterminated the indigenous people. Those poor penguins better hope they never find oil down there.  


9653 2018-03-04 16:51:03 Hai, here a mom of an 11-year old and 5-year old. I have a little curly, thin hair, which never looks shiny or smooth. The oil seems promising. Unfortunately can wash my hair only every 4 to 5 days. Do you think I can use the oil or does it make your hair look more dirty?
9654 2018-03-04 16:50:56 We have everything we need and more inside us. You don’t need crystals, tarot cards, zodiacs, sage, oil, holy water, shrooms, weed, acid... none of that. I swea
9655 2018-03-04 16:50:47 Your dick is bulb shape, nobody helps me, and i need that oil!
9656 2018-03-04 16:50:31 I cut grass for $25 & car oil changes for $25  fwm
9657 2018-03-04 16:50:15 I'm using northern lights for the pain which is high THC low CBD - seems effective.  Use high THC oil at night, some CBD there also
9658 2018-03-04 16:50:13 Anything for the money.... 
Oil and water fix well as long as money is to be made.
9659 2018-03-04 16:49:41 Excellent. [mixing stuff] Now the wet ingredients, please. Water and oil.
9660 2018-03-04 16:49:34 Not disgusting at all.  The "monument" remains protected.  The land around it, under a longstanding program in Utah, had been open to oil and natural gas exploration used to raise revenue for public schools, had the land not been grabbed under federal program. Feds took that away
9661 2018-03-04 16:49:30 Things like ice cream,kota, processed foods,GMO , oil, chocolates, cars and toxic industry smoke etc mut be taken out of the country we an intelligence country world health organization agrees and so does true care we support the notion
9662 2018-03-04 16:49:29 “Big Oil” @algore apparently has put that $100M he collected for selling Al Jazeera to good use by feeding the hungry especially himself.

9667 2018-03-04 16:49:02 Been on the treadmill for an hour I smell like crisco oil
9668 2018-03-04 16:48:56 Who is they? If we are talking fans, the narrative is already out there. Shameful. #Oilers
9669 2018-03-04 16:48:56 City can do all they want. Build a dynasty. Play the best football in Europe. With the best players, the best manager. But empty seats & plastic atmosphere, oil money can’t buy that. Unbelievably spoilt & this is the return.
9670 2018-03-04 16:48:53 Aw my parents so cute Lol always wanna spoil my ass   brakes  oil change  tires 
9671 2018-03-04 16:48:53 So the UK will suddenly be rich in oil reserves?
9672 2018-03-04 16:48:49 What’s in RENAISSANCE OIL CORP ORDINARY SHARES C (OTCMKTS:RNSFF) After Rise in Shorted Share...
9673 2018-03-04 16:48:45 COCONUT OIL IS THE MOST SUPERIOR OF OILS
9674 2018-03-04 16:48:44 No but I’m really interested. My diffuser & essential oil combos have really helped when I had bad colds and congestion. I’ve also been looking at air purifiers
9675 2018-03-04 16:48:39 Factored in using finite resources like oil, causing environmental damage etc?  The world would be a better place without ic engine vehicle users with a misplaced sense of entitlement.
9676 2018-03-04 16:48:24 When they realized they weren't going to be able to steal Iraq's oil as Trump promised during his campaign, they decided to steal it from America.
9677 2018-03-04 16:48:23 Money. Oil.
9678 2018-03-04 16:48:18 I think ur doing oil massage to kannadians by tweeting in Kannada language, never tweeted previously in regional languages .I think f*****g elections are nearer @PMOIndia
9679 2018-03-04 16:48:17 No it was bad. They cut it like 1/2' thick, it was so tough they probably used a chainsaw, then they warmed it in a frying pan in 10-40 oil. When delivered you couldn't see the color of the meat from frying it, it was covered in au jus that must have been made with Gravy Train.
9680 2018-03-04 16:48:08 last night marco was like i have a funnel in my car!! and he came back with an oil funnel LMAOOO
9681 2018-03-04 16:48:04 Great idea. Plastic is corsometic. People don’t know that plastic is oil product. Maybe soon we get Republicans and Christianity out from White House. Luck them up
9682 2018-03-04 16:47:33 Fish oil or vitamin D supplements FTW!
9683 2018-03-04 16:47:32 Ever since I changed my hair relaxer kit from dark& lovely to Olive oil (organic) I have been battling dandruff. I immediately switched back to dark&lovely when I noticed but the deed has been done. I have used everything but this dandruff won’t go 
9684 2018-03-04 16:47:23 For some reason, I am now imagining you experiencing some old-timey snake oil salesman trying to hook you up with a 'guaranteed cure' for vinegar smell. 

I'm betting there would be laudanum in it or something ..
9685 2018-03-04 16:47:21 220 degrees for 20 mins then 160 degrees for 10 mins per 500g., with rosemary and garlic jammed into the skin, rubbed in olive oil pepper and salt. Whatever you do don’t over cook it!
9686 2018-03-04 16:47:20 Also there's this oil that you get from holland and Barrett (I'll find out the name for you) which you put a few drops on your tongue and it's meant to naturally decrease the anxiety - but if you want this one, maybe try it before you travel to see if it helps you
9687 2018-03-04 16:47:00 In communist-regime occupied Poland (till 1989), people illegally bartered to survive.

Meanwhile, Venezuela owes the rest of the world almost $200 billion, it's one of the biggest oil providers - and it's illegal there to report starvation as a caused of death among kids.
9688 2018-03-04 16:46:58 My dad said he was gonna pay for my oil change then he found out my car uses synthetic oil so he hit me with "pay me back" 
9689 2018-03-04 16:46:57 Very pretty! Running out of heating oil not good; that's one thing we made sure was topped up a couple of weeks ago!

9693 2018-03-04 16:46:23 My birthday is this week and all i can think about it how excited I am for that oil change my mom is going to get me.
9694 2018-03-04 16:45:57 You newfies come to alberta to work the oil patch all the time you are a hypocrite using by products of oil sitting in your cozy home, using a cell phone and how do you get around if you don't drive you are being driven
9695 2018-03-04 16:45:57 my  breaks. No animal should starve. My   breaks even though it also breaks for the seal he would eat.  GD, Trumpf would be fine allowing this lovely beast be extinct for oil drilling. Is Pruitt gone yet? America, get off your lazy ass and get some grownups in the WH. my God!
9696 2018-03-04 16:45:53 Exactly not biased or anything. Drillers are going to US because Canadian oil is the most expensive in world to process. Agressive fracking in the US makes them the world's highest producer. Workers follow the money. If anyone can make more money somewhere else they go.
9697 2018-03-04 16:45:50 UAE Billionaire 11 versus Russian oil oligarch 11 remains goalless in the English Moneyball final. Curiously zero is also the number of English players on the park. #MCICHE

9699 2018-03-04 16:45:25 Waste of Cannabis oil , only likely to set off more brain waves unless administered in ox stunning dose? I have found Clary Sage oil to contain an unbeatable knock out  .

9702 2018-03-04 16:44:45 We also have oil, apparently a ton of steel.
9703 2018-03-04 16:44:44 2.8 degrees might happen. But Canada is synthesizing crude oil, UK switches to low-carbon slowly, Germany's still burning their oldest forests, and the US fell some time ago.
9704 2018-03-04 16:44:42 Took the car in to get an oil change (this is in Texas, BTW) and the tech asked to speak with me. I was wondering what was wrong with my car when he took me around to the bumper and said 2/

9713 2018-03-04 16:43:20 Was just wondering if DT's solution to rising oil prices would be a return to steam power. Steam is a "renewable energy source"... once the steam cools you can re-use it! (Also works with coal, lumber and nuclear power as a heat source!)
9714 2018-03-04 16:43:18 Their platform is:
Gun control,
PREVENT cuts to SSI, SNAP & MEDICARE,
close loopholes for the rich (opposite of what Trump did),
Path for Dreamers,
Improve healthcare exchanges,
Have normal trade relations with every country,
Reduce our need for oil imports,

Got me thinking about how to make a #vegan high-fat #ketogenic drink - likely some mix of veg oil, coconut, avocado, nuts... and increased volume!

Sick of all the platitudes towards city. They’d still be irrelevant without oil money.
9726 2018-03-04 16:41:47 @ctvqp When @EvanLSolomon speaks the truth, lists reasons for lack of foreign investment in Canada re:trade tariffs, oil sands, NAFTA. @Bill_Morneau responds, “Evan, that was a whole lot of negative speak.”  I say, “No Bill, that is a whole lot of truth speak, a foreign concept.”
9727 2018-03-04 16:41:35 Just watched @LovingVincent with my mum & wife. As fans of oil painting and art this was one of the most fascinating and memorable movies I’ve watched. Absolutely beautiful motion picture. 
9728 2018-03-04 16:41:33 Because it was bringing the African monarchs income. Just like oil brings the leaders money. It also made sense that something more lucrative brought money.

9731 2018-03-04 16:41:06 Black castor oil one? Or the actual black one
9732 2018-03-04 16:40:55 In terms of conventional crude oil, the USA is depleting, as  is the rest of the world. Because of temporary reserves such as Bakken, the USA is not as depleting as rapidly, thus this emergence.

9738 2018-03-04 16:40:17 Obama has reduced?
He has reduced according to the desire of #Iran_pure_evil to allow her to be the first the world in one hand. 
In other hand, he has reduced the price of oil barrels in the world according to the desire of #Iran to give her chance to destroy Saudi's economic.

9746 2018-03-04 16:39:06 They need to broken up then plain and simple they are in too many things and using size to hurt companies just like standard oil was broken up

9756 2018-03-04 16:37:28 About to drop my car off for an oil change and roller blade back home. Thoughts and prayers deeply appreciated during this time because i dont really know how to brake.
9757 2018-03-04 16:37:06 The whole Arab countries are at fault..  Just stop the crude oil supply for two days and the world will be in their feet...  But they are busy banging their wives and partying.. Such a shame

9769 2018-03-04 16:35:41 Because the oil companies don’t own the sun, duh! Pay attention sometime !

9793 2018-03-04 16:31:39 You're hopeless if u trust capitalists to do that. The whole point for capitalists to invest into something is if they see massive profits ahead for them. And massive profits of resources tend to be more profitable thru scarcity. If they play with oil supply go figure
9794 2018-03-04 16:31:27 wow I cut jalapeños this morning cus my mom is making cochinita and now my fingers are covered in the jalapeños' oil and everytime I touch my face it burns

9818 2018-03-04 16:28:52 Jumping in on this. A couple instances (I have many), the extent of KoreAn Gov subsidies to the likes of Hyundi and Kia are enormous. Indonesia - minerals, Singapore - biotech, Saudi - oil & gas.  It’s FAR from a level playing field out there.

9826 2018-03-04 16:27:23 He may have followed the script for a “smaller government”, but if he spends all the money saved on himself, how does that help the bottom line? Oh, and why do they always start deregulating where the oil is? Weird
9827 2018-03-04 16:27:13 Over 95% of the meat produced in this country comes from factory farms. It is a living Hell for those animals. It's a living Hell for ANY animals going to slaughter. They know! As to palm oil, I don't know one vegan who's not aware of this issue. We're ardent label readers.
9828 2018-03-04 16:27:02 Perhaps you could think more about how to increase our use of electric vehicles, solar energy, and wind while eliminating the burning of oil, coal, and gas. We have a chance to be the world leaders in manufacturing and sales of clean energy if we make the right moves now.
9829 2018-03-04 16:26:59 Haha,  I can’t even begin to imagine how cold it must be over there but I bet it doesn’t come to a standstill like this country!

9887 2018-03-04 16:19:34 I know its only 2 oil clubs, but its the champions against chmpions elect, in front of a smaller crowd than Arsenal. Unbelievable
9888 2018-03-04 16:19:30 Teachers strike in West Virginia, now Oklahoma teachers talk walkout & rumblings in Kansas. Red states that continuously cut taxes in favor of oil barons off school funding, teachers salaries, material & healthcare. Lots of unhappiness stirring in red states.

9905 2018-03-04 16:17:55 Well if steel becomes too expensive they will switch to plastic wherever possible. Plastic is sourced from the oil industry, mostly. Not a conspiracy, as I'm sure trump has no connection it friends in the oil business.
9906 2018-03-04 16:17:52 Chelsea’s loaded, sure, but the purse strings have been very tight come transfer time lately.  City spend that bottomless oil money freely.  #losingatourowngame

9921 2018-03-04 16:15:19 I'll take kasky seriously when he gives up his Apple products made by slave labor.  Doesn't use anything made with oil products and steps off his unearned high horse.

9923 2018-03-04 16:15:05 #Israel wants that oil, but more so it wants to retain hegemony in the Middle East & Iran is competition. Persia has been around a long time, Israel for a few belligerent years.

9925 2018-03-04 16:14:34 The US would have to conduct more "goods-for-goods" free trade & less "goods for IOUs" free trade.  Think shale oil v. printing USD's for foreign oil = good or bad for the US?

I don’t know if you’re an essential oil nut like me, but I feel like this will really open up all the benefits I already receive from aromatherapy. For real, worth every penny.
9931 2018-03-04 16:14:01 Decided to come to my home church today and of course it would be a convention going on n I have my oil up legs out lol
9932 2018-03-04 16:13:30 ping @christogrozev @JuliaDavisNews @VeikoSpolitis @IlvesToomas Putin's says the US election meddlers acted unauthorized. Rings the bells? They reused the narrative when tried to отжать Conoco oil factory but had some explaining to do.
9933 2018-03-04 16:13:28 Don't forget Venezuela has the biggest oil resreves in the World.
9934 2018-03-04 16:13:26 Not only that, it will hurt the domestic economy because US is dependent on imported high-grade steel for bridges and oil pipelines. Plus retaliation from international suppliers like EU on American imports.

9937 2018-03-04 16:13:09 If it comes from natural gas and oil then yes it absolutely can......they gouge this state of natural resources with large profit margins and it’s all because of how many tax breaks they receive....so you can’t tell me that 2 or 3 percent of that would hurt them

9964 2018-03-04 16:09:38 There are more people employed in oil consuming sectors than there are in oil producing sectors, and yet a massive reduction in US oil imports & massive increase in US oil exports is seen as nothing but a + for the US economy.  Why?  By this logic, shale renaissance = disaster...
9965 2018-03-04 16:09:33 Scott why is MSM ignoring the fact that Trump has allowed sanctioned Russian petroleum products to be granted safe passage, violating the sanctions already in place? It seems he’s done an end run around the sanctions by Putin’s use of French ships to bring his oil to the world.
9966 2018-03-04 16:09:30 Canada subsidizes industry.  Ask the timber folks, the oil folks, the aviation folks.

It's not fair trade.

If we send 10+ million of the illegal aliens here, north to Canada, how do you think they'd view our border?

Btw they contribute less then 1% GDP toward defense.

9970 2018-03-04 16:09:11 its just supported it seems. I dont see this much promising until they regularize the oil sales.
this is my personal opinion though :)

9976 2018-03-04 16:07:43 Your loyalty lies with oil and gas companies, who buy your vote to keep their severance tax low. If you cared about WV taxpayers or children, with their small voices, you and your Republican colleagues would stop wasting time, read bills thoroughly, and pass what Justice offered.
9977 2018-03-04 16:07:37 Looking like somebody spilled Baby oil on her head 
9978 2018-03-04 16:07:07 Of course they treat canines poorly, look how they treat humans. Did you expect to find an alternative reality when looking into the US gov’t? We live in a society that’s shocked when a gov’t, sending its people out to die/kill for oil, around the globe, doesn’t care about life.
9979 2018-03-04 16:07:04 Whilst the Russian defense is based on low cost innovation, the NATO defense is based on corruption, drugs and oil trafficking. The West has to rethink its strategy. Luckely unlike NATO, the Russians have no intend to terrorize, conquer, loot and kill.

9985 2018-03-04 16:06:30 Fox News is paid by large oil companies to report media to divide the public on issues concerning climate change. James Inhofe the biggest climate change denier in Congress, receives the most money from fossil fuel companies.

10002 2018-03-04 16:04:55 WTF!!!    Speaking on the pro-Trump Christian Broadcasting Network last week, Pruitt said his faith is partially what motivates him to remove regulations on higher-polluting sources of energy like coal, oil, and natural gas.
10003 2018-03-04 16:04:50 I guess maybe Canada should limit oil and electricity exports to US. With slow NAFTA negotiations Canada needs to expand trade with other countries. Trumps protectionism will only end up hurting US economy. Canada has all raw materials needed without US.
