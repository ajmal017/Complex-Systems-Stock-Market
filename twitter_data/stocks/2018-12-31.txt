56 2018-12-31 23:46:04 Now they're up...that's what stocks do. Especially when the Federal Reserve manipulates the market. End the Federsl Reserve!

59 2018-12-31 23:45:00 2018 - Stocks had their worst year in a decade, DOW's worst December since 1931. US Debt balloons to $21 trillion, the size of Brazil's economy. Way to maga, @realDonaldTrump . The USA is your next business failure, as expected. #TrumpResign

61 2018-12-31 23:43:37 My point is, I’ve not heard of anyone that lost their ass on stocks at all this year.
62 2018-12-31 23:42:48 Well I dipped my toe into this game  blind as a bat just over a year ago after a few stock tips from a friend. I bought 2 stocks. I got lucky and both bagged within a few months. One 3 bagged from my original investment but ended up losing most of it! H2 2018 was an education
63 2018-12-31 23:39:14 That’s what they are saying. I didn’t see any of it, bought apple stock in ‘14 at $93 a share, sold it back in Sept. for over $220 a share. Sold several other stocks under similar situation. I’ve got no complaints with the market this year. Happy, happy, happy.
64 2018-12-31 23:36:55 @Tesla is not even in the top 40 of shorted stocks - Microsoft, Starbucks, Intel, AMD - even Walgreens is shorted more! If shorts are so bloody terrible why are their CEO's not out crying? Why are their shareholders not blaming shorts and calling them names?
65 2018-12-31 23:36:19 Really?What exactly has the #CriminallyUnfitAndArtlessToad @realDonaldTrump delivered on this year—
no wall paid for by Mexico

No rebuilt infrastructure

Stocks in worst decline since last GOP President

ISIS isn’t defeated

Obamacare is still around

Trade imbalance with China
66 2018-12-31 23:35:15 Not bad.  I prefer the stocks myself so as not to have a moving target.
67 2018-12-31 23:34:51 Hmmm.  So where are the stories about all those company’s using the tax cut to buy back stocks? Seems like they should be loosing their asses now. Why aren’t y’all talking about that.
68 2018-12-31 23:34:16 In 2019 I will start charting for all individual stocks... but as of right now now.  Miners will take some time, starting off with FANGS, but at some point yes.  Feel free to DM me some companies and I can start taking a look
69 2018-12-31 23:34:16 4-6 months living expenses in easy access savings account. One with 2%+ yearly yield.

Always do your own research for stocks, aim for areas you know best. There’s also decent managed providers like Wealthfront.

73 2018-12-31 23:31:15 Complicating things is usd looks like it cd be on the verge of a meaningful, protracted selloff, beyond the “small pullback before new highs” consensus. So what to do with that? In normal times this shd be supportive of stocks, and bullish em. But these aren’t normal times...
74 2018-12-31 23:30:57 Stocks are dying right now...uh
75 2018-12-31 23:30:51 How to change it:
- 2 stocks for Classic
- Nerf Ness to the God Damn Ground
- Add Boss Rush with a few more new bosses
- Add returning modes
- Add DLC Costumes 9 and 10 for all Characters. 
- Fix Online
- Have options for what victory theme should play
- Additional DLC Story?

It  was the worst year for stocks since 2008 and only the second year the  Dow and S&P 500 fell in the past decade. December was a particularly dreadful month: the worst Dec since 1931.
121 2018-12-31 23:15:05 Let me guess it’s bitcoin and pot stocks
122 2018-12-31 23:14:55 Remember no matter what that we are in a Bear market in stocks but not bonds. Boring over sexy.
123 2018-12-31 23:14:36 Stocks have been abnormally calm for a few years now. 2017 was particularly so. We just went thru a period of volatility in October and December, with things returning pretty much back to the "new normal" of calm in the last week.
124 2018-12-31 23:13:15 2018 should called "TRUMP DUMP" Stocks down - Gains gone.  So much for the "TRUMP BUMP".  @realDonaldTrump can't manage to keep anything afloat for long. Disappointment, not success. GOP should look elsewhere in 2020.
125 2018-12-31 23:12:57 Bump stocks aren't arms, they're an optional modification, ergo they aren't relevant tot the 2nd amendment. This is like saying a ban on flashlights would be a breach of the 2nd amendment because they too can be attached to guns.
126 2018-12-31 23:12:23 Not even. Completely cleaned out. Nobody in the Dirty Dirty stocks them, not even the puny turtle cans. Very disappointed.
127 2018-12-31 23:12:05 Bye  2018 U.S markets as stocks slide end of the trading day for the volatile year 
128 2018-12-31 23:11:46 Bye  2018 U.S markets as stocks slide end of the trading day for the volatile year 
129 2018-12-31 23:09:28 There's going to be more at that time most likely! These were just stocks not in storage that ran over (I was expecting to need them, but didn't). I think a lot of people had their info prefilled to just submit and go.
130 2018-12-31 23:08:47 Maybe time to stop worrying about the "wall", and start worrying about America's financial well-being? "It was the worst year for stocks since 2008 and only the second year the Dow and S&P 500 fell in the past decade."  Oh, wait.  That's probably the Dems fault as well..
131 2018-12-31 23:07:48 When you get to Congress take a poll and see if you can get fellow members to pledge they will not accept money from big oil and coal and divest from them if they own stocks. Start with a few to start a coalition.
132 2018-12-31 23:07:01 This Year may your hair and teeth, your face-lift, abs and stocks NOT fall, may your blood pressure,cholesterol,white blood count and mortgage interest not rise. Happy New Year! 
133 2018-12-31 23:05:41 hey the main difference between netplay and not netplay for me is a down smash less and don't die from shine 3 stocks only 2
134 2018-12-31 23:05:13 There is spool much vegan cheese out there, every supermarket stocks it and vegan supermarkets even have loads of small batch cheeses that are very like the specialist ones. Try the Alternative Store who will post them for you. Good luck.
135 2018-12-31 23:04:46 Wow I hope next year is the same as this year ! At this rate I can retire in 5 years instead of having to wait till I’m 100 like I thought I would when Barry was destroying the country ! Whatever trumps doing is working for my stocks ! Could care less about the poor investors 
136 2018-12-31 23:04:45 I'd really like to know if Trump has some kind of vested interest or owns stocks in any company where he would profit by building the wall?
137 2018-12-31 23:03:21 The behavior of gold and UST suggest equity market will not hold up.  A technical drop in the dollar could help short term, could certainly rally a little more, but without the Fed relenting, I can't see any direction that makes sense for stocks but down. Fed is choking economy.
138 2018-12-31 23:03:15 BREAKING: US stocks suffer worst year since the last time Republicans were in charge
139 2018-12-31 23:01:46 Batman is a billionaire. Of course I crush it with stocks!  in all seriousness, if you’re new to stocks you should look into ETFs for either IHF or UNH. They have a real chance to replicate a strong 2018. But then you’d be admitting Obamacare success so... 
140 2018-12-31 23:01:39 -Imputting an accidental Directional Airdodge instead of a standard one or a tech to the ground.
-squad strike should have more individual stocks for fighters
-Final Smash Spirits would be cool to look at
-SPECIFIC patch notes!
-Laggy stages should not be laggy.
141 2018-12-31 23:00:36 Worst year for US #stocks in over a decade....
Haven't heard @realDonaldTrump talk about the #StockMarket in a while, wonder why.....
142 2018-12-31 22:59:54 #CNBC says  US stocks post worst year in a decade as the S&P 500 falls more than 6% in 2018 Trump is still building the wall !
143 2018-12-31 22:59:35 Thanks for all your valuable insights, experience anddare I say entertaining approach to investing. I'm a Brisbane based Aussie vested in US stocks and my journey has been made that much easier because I've listened to you. Happy New Year and keep up the terrific work!
144 2018-12-31 22:59:16 Stocks in the red for December, 2018 despite New Year’s Eve gains. How can this be a down year? The stoke market has never been this high before!!!!!!
145 2018-12-31 22:58:45 Trump took credit when stocks were on the rise. Doesn't he also own the slump?
146 2018-12-31 22:58:44 Start putting money away ..... something big is brewing. FEDS raises rates and stocks are acting funny in the light .... (save this tweet)
147 2018-12-31 22:57:51 Which stocks helped on that?
148 2018-12-31 22:57:47 U.S. Stocks Have Worst Year Since 2008, Worst Dec. Since 1931
149 2018-12-31 22:57:44 To be antagonistic: Nothing about Stocks, or Home, needs to be an ‘app’. They /could/ have been just as compelling & functional as “PWA”; on all of apples platforms.
150 2018-12-31 22:57:40 I pulled better than 18%...

Banks and Finance took big losses because of the FED. Oil going down (because we are more Energy Independent) took down two Dow specific stocks. And the Tech Stocks took hits (I believe purposely for political reasons). Dow and Nasdaq are indicators..
151 2018-12-31 22:57:34 BREAKING: US stocks conclude 2018 with the major stock indexes posting worst yearly performances since the 2008 financial crisis.  Another well kept promise???
152 2018-12-31 22:57:07 All I've wanted to do, is teach my people how investing is not some geometric feature. It's a tool we can use to build upon. To push generational wealth, so when we are gone we've left more behind than old student loans. We can leave a business, and stocks to live off of.
153 2018-12-31 22:56:57 Teach me how to adult, @cody_tmv ! I’m afraid of getting into stocks
154 2018-12-31 22:56:32 Super risky? My safe stocks got killed. Thanks. Amazon Netflix and Tesla up for the year. Maybe we look at risk differently.
155 2018-12-31 22:56:18 U.S. Stocks Have Worst Year Since 2008, Worst Dec. Since 1931
156 2018-12-31 22:56:16 Every time I beat someone with 2 stocks, high percent, I'm grateful that this is a 3 stock game
157 2018-12-31 22:56:00 U.S. stocks drifted higher Monday but closed out 2018 with their steepest annual declines since the financial crisis, reflecting growing unease among investors about the health of the nearly decade-long bull run. Yep you are tanking our economy.
158 2018-12-31 22:55:46 That's what we done too, minus the humous. 
Now on the dairy milk. Hawes at Easter to replenish the cheese stocks though

161 2018-12-31 22:55:19 For stocks? Yes
162 2018-12-31 22:54:57 Stocks wrap up worst year in a decade
163 2018-12-31 22:54:52 I would add: Because it didn’t do it today, doesn’t mean it can’t do it tomorrow.

However, you’re free to say “These should be showcases for the future of macOS, and marzipan, but they aren’t”. IMHO for Home, Stocks, and prob. News, they don’t need those experiences.
164 2018-12-31 22:54:35 U need 2b quick and sharp too. Catching a News and the market direction. Don't forget times. Depending the stocks too. Some stocks low $0.50 I don't want to buy. But some low only a penny I love to have it back. Now good lesson for a new year right.
165 2018-12-31 22:53:55 BREAKING: US stocks suffer worst year since 2008 financial crisis; S&P 500 sees 6.2 percent annual drop, Dow falls 5.6 percent.

I’m not sure if it’s on elite or qp but 5 stocks is kinda pain to play with
168 2018-12-31 22:53:20 You do have bread for this. You have unlocked potential. I recommend you learn to trade stocks and other investment instruments and change your entire life.. You can do it bro! Let’s change the narrative... 
169 2018-12-31 22:53:18 @realDonaldTrump Worst year for stocks since 2008! God help us from your  “so much winning” in 2019
170 2018-12-31 22:53:17 Yeah that’s where this photo was taken, just gotta hope my local stocks it!
171 2018-12-31 22:52:50 Is it because you got your stocks on?
172 2018-12-31 22:52:28 @realDonaldTrump So much winning and not a word from you about this success! Wall Street closed out a dismal, turbulent year for stocks on a bright note Monday, but still finished 2018 with the worst showing in a decade.
173 2018-12-31 22:52:05 U.S. stocks rises as dollar slips

175 2018-12-31 22:51:53 @WSJ @realDonaldTrump @federalreserve We believe the Dems, EU, Soros, tech monopolies & people who benefit from China strong & US in decline are tampering with Stock Market. Trump jobs, GDP & tax cuts do not align to what’s happening to Stocks with sell offs and illogical panic!
176 2018-12-31 22:51:20 Hey pal Congrats! Worst year for stocks since 2008. Going to blame Obama and Schumer for that too? Sad. #WorstPresidentEver

178 2018-12-31 22:51:03 The missing link between apes and humans are people who pick 2 stocks on quickplay.
179 2018-12-31 22:51:01 Always an amateur in the room not paying attention ! Smart people are making money as I am that chart isn’t a reflection of my stocks just a poor reference to a small attention span . Try to read what people write before responding so very poorly next time . 
180 2018-12-31 22:51:00 Did U promise to kill migrant kids?
Did U promise to allow pollution/poisoning: killing our water, air, and earth?
Did U promise to destroy US economy & create another recess: US stocks suffer worst year since 2008 financial crisis; S&P 500 sees 6.2% annual drop, Dow falls 5.6%.
181 2018-12-31 22:50:32 Hmm...Lets see...U.S. stocks in 2018 suffered their worst annual performance in a decade. Despite making gains on Monday, the S&P 500 finished 2018 down 6.2 %,  while the DJIA was down 5.6%. Those  drops marked the worst year 4 U.S. stocks since the 2008. Not likely.
182 2018-12-31 22:50:18 US Stocks suffers their worst year since the 2008 financial crisis. 
Elections have consequences.
Happy New Year.
183 2018-12-31 22:48:41 Stocks post worst year in a decade! Thanks D

185 2018-12-31 22:48:10 @realDonaldTrump Stocks close in December the worst since 1931 let me guess it’s the Democrats fault.
186 2018-12-31 22:48:08 Don't ya just want to wipe that "I'm right EGO " off peter stocks face. The man is insufferable, and needs to be whipped, boiled in oil...have parts of his anatomy cut off..etc.. There all evil people This is why I don't trust the F.B.I. anymore..Its all a big pile of 
187 2018-12-31 22:48:07 Honestly the fact that people run for the last 30 seconds of a match in ultimate when they're at 2 stocks 180% just so they can get the win is so fucking pathetic.

189 2018-12-31 22:47:06 What's unfair is all your #winning!  What a joke you are.  Stocks have the worst year in a decade.  YOU are killing us with your irrational economic, trade and foreign policies.  Stop whining about others and get things right.

197 2018-12-31 22:43:42 Employers used to spring for HMO/PPO plans. Since Obamacare most only provide a high deductible plan. The system used to work. Why not now? Used to have one doctor, now they are all specialists. 20 million uninsured illegals? Congress making billions on med stocks?

199 2018-12-31 22:43:12 I think your missing her point. When you buy Apple stocks, you have a stake in the company, you buy xrp and your just contributing to ripples $163m xrp profits while the price of xrp drops. Sound investing

207 2018-12-31 22:41:01 No.
Only a reminder that - with #stocks now having soared while the visible economy languised in recent years - stocks are just an upscale version of lottery tickets.
208 2018-12-31 22:40:27 US stocks post worst year in a decade as the S&P 500 falls more than 6% in 2018

Just the facts.
209 2018-12-31 22:40:21 They’re bad Mac apps though.

And I think they’re bad apps for a windowing-based GUI, period. News, Stocks, and Voice Memos should all be able to open multiple windows. It’s downright absurd that they can’t.

And Home’s iOS datepicker is a horrendous control for a non-touch UI.

215 2018-12-31 22:39:09 2018 was the worst year for stocks in 10 years. How do you give massive tax breaks to Corporations, who use the money to buy back their own stocks and still crash the market? @realDonaldTrump managed to figure it out.

243 2018-12-31 22:32:58 Some people will recklessly try to blame this on Trump.  Remember stocks sky rocked when he was elected.

256 2018-12-31 22:25:51 It was a December to remember, but not in a good way.  Stocks tanked and for the year they suffered their worst performance since the 2008 financial crisis.  Via CNBC. #ThanksTrump Via News & Guts

2018 was one investors would rather forget. US stocks had their worst year in a decade and the Dow and S&P 500 had their worst December since 1931
278 2018-12-31 22:20:32 "Correction" implies that stocks were inherently overpriced, and thus the market is somehow massively inefficient.

298 2018-12-31 22:15:29 When the stock market experiences a correction, rich elites suffer most.
When the job market experiences a downturn, the poor suffer most.

Under Obama, stocks were one of the few metrics to boom
Under Trump, jobs are booming.

So why are Democrats whining about the stock market?

351 2018-12-31 22:05:45 Not a bad thing for those that depend on a big drop in the price of stocks so those auto deductions out of their paychecks get more shares for the buck.
352 2018-12-31 22:05:33 After having their best year in a decade in 2017, stocks did the natural thing and retreated.  A lot of buying opportunities out there.

376 2018-12-31 22:01:08 Trump doesn’t have time for facts, to busy winning “US stocks post worst year in a decade as the S&P 500 falls more than 6% in 2018”

NEW YORK (AP) — US stocks suffer worst year since 2008 financial crisis; S&P 500 sees 6.2 percent annual drop, Dow falls 5.6 percent.
Fake numbers?

If TrumpO was a stock it'd be a GREAT short. (MAGA peep asking whats a "short"?) Its like a wall but w/out the wall parts. #ARTofTheFAIL

381 2018-12-31 22:00:23 Also, the Trump Drones hang their hat on "we just had the highest single day gain in stocks ever." Let's ignore the steady tanking that's been going on outside of that.

386 2018-12-31 21:59:23 “Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell declared 2018 the “best year since the financial crisis” after revealing a late 2018 quarter percent rate hike. . .”

389 2018-12-31 21:59:10 Perhaps U S/China agreement early this year will propel the stocks forward again, that and finally solving the shutdown.

398 2018-12-31 21:57:08 That rate change was well before the stocks started to fall off.  Stocks in fact went up after the previous rate change. You're trying to say that rates changed, the markets waited almost 2 months, then started to fall from that rate change.
399 2018-12-31 21:56:59 Hey @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama beat you at stocks too. STRADY LOSIN TRUMP.

403 2018-12-31 21:55:33 Yeah, because stocks had their worst year since the LAST republican held office because the reality show actor and faux billionaire "tells it like it is" and lies like the son of a bitch he is.

410 2018-12-31 21:53:07 If you think that the only reason the stocks go down is solely from Trump, you’d be wrong. There are many factors that contribute to the performance of the market.

415 2018-12-31 21:51:30 Dear @realDonaldTrump in 2018 US stocks had their worst year in a decade and the Dow and S&P500 had their worst December this century. So that’s what #MAGA means?
416 2018-12-31 21:51:02 Your stocks are my retirement.  Be a good boy,
417 2018-12-31 21:50:51 Usually best NOT TO TAKE MONEY OUT OF YOUR 401K or IRA.  When people say they are selling their stocks, they are LEAVING THE MONEY IN THE 401K or IRA.  They are just changing their investment option WITHIN the fund to different investment...usually money market.

420 2018-12-31 21:50:38 I was up 75% earlier this year on the stockmarket, but last few months of 2018 has made some heavy losses on some oil stocks. However MAHA saved me and ending up around 27,6% YTD. Wish you all a happy new year and hope for a better 2019 as this year been pretty rough! Happy 2019!
421 2018-12-31 21:50:38 That is a load of crap. When Obama his President the stock was a mere 13000 some point and under Trump it is at 23 something. Now tell me how that is the worst in a decade. Stocks go down and stocks go up that is what they do omg.

424 2018-12-31 21:49:54 Trump rode Obama's coattails for a year, then implemented his own policies (mostly by EO) and everything bottomed out. Stocks, bonds (somehow), dollar, unemployment, wages. The only people who benefited were the companies who used the tax cut $ for buybacks and the super rich

446 2018-12-31 21:45:24 In 2018: The Dow fell -5.6%,the S&P 500 down -6.2% and the NASDAQ fell 4%. Worst year for stocks since 2008 & only the 2nd year the Dow & S&P 500 fell in the past decade.

455 2018-12-31 21:43:42 Stocks salvage some redemption in the last week of 2018. However, with the 2Y yield going out at 2.49%, markets are primed for an immediate confrontation with the Fed in January. If Powell doesn’t capitulate on further rate hikes right away, SPX strength could prove short lived.

 6. Signs that acceleration will continue

486 2018-12-31 21:38:16 Again, stocks have been on an up trend since ‘10,  however 2018 has given negative returns, and not by a small margin. This is due to the end of the sugar high and the idiocy of the trade war

“US stocks post worst year in a decade as the S&P 500 falls more than 6% in 2018”

MSM like you pushed “Fear” & “Doom’nGloom” in unprecedented fashion & need to admit that the US Market fared much better than others: Shanghai -24%, FTSE -13%...

All about Hate
496 2018-12-31 21:35:56 @realDonaldTrump US stocks post worst year in a decade as S&P 500 falls more than 6% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 5.6%. Hey, great job dumbass! Do us all a favor and fucking resign.  You don't have a clue as to what you are doing. Fucking amateur.

500 2018-12-31 21:35:21 2018 was a record-setting year for stocks, but it's one investors would rather forget.
The Dow fell 5.6%. The S&P 500 was down 6.4% and the Nasdaq fell 4%. It was the worst year for stocks since 2008 and only the second year the Dow and S&P 500 fell in the past decade.
501 2018-12-31 21:35:13 Hey trumpets, Stocks closed out a bruising 2018 with gains on New Year's Eve but the rally wasn't enough to help the market avoid its biggest annual loss in a decade and the biggest loss in Dec since the Depression all under @realDonaldTrump Administration. Winning yet?
502 2018-12-31 21:35:01 2018 saw the U.S stocks worst loss since the the crisis of housing drop. Trumps trade wars, lack of foreign strategy, supporting dictators, alienating our allies and shutting our country down were the reasons.

512 2018-12-31 21:33:46 This is how recessions start! Stocks take a dip, then layoff start.. I’m not looking for a recession but it sure has signs of it!
513 2018-12-31 21:33:35 Stocks end 2018 with their worst year in a decade. Remember this was Trump's favorite economic barometer during 2017.

516 2018-12-31 21:33:04 That's it? Felt magnitudes worse, maybe because of my allocation to Emerging markets & Intl stocks.

522 2018-12-31 21:32:01 The SPLV chart shows I was right when I predicted that traders wld shift into safe stocks which I called:"Boring Stocks".
523 2018-12-31 21:31:53 Trying to distract us? The Dow fell 5.6%. The S&P 500 was down 6.4% and the Nasdaq fell 4%. It was the worst year for stocks since 2008 and only the second year the Dow and S&P 500 fell in the past decade.

561 2018-12-31 21:24:12 U.S. markets closed a tumultuous 2018 in the red, in the worst year for stocks since 2008. The S&P 500 and Dow are down 6.5% and 5.8%, respectively for 2018.
562 2018-12-31 21:24:02 @realDonaldTrump 2018 was the worst for stocks in 10 years. Please ask favorite President Obama for advice. He can help. He knows about the economy. He really can help you.
563 2018-12-31 21:23:31 No one ever said that. Stocks are down mid-single digits for the year. No one ever ruled out a bear market. Some said we'd never have another major crisis. That is also false!

575 2018-12-31 21:22:00 No velocity. Rigged gold market via paper derivatives.  Operation twist sanitized long term bond rate which is best inflation indicator, money sat on bank balance sheets, inflation was focused on financial assets. Huge inflation in stocks. Bubble. Also, delay.  Wait for it......
576 2018-12-31 21:21:59 U.S. stocks suffered their worst year since the 2008 financial crisis. 
The S&P 500 saw a 6.2% annual drop, 
the Dow fell 5.6% 
and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.9%.

Spoiler Alert - NASDAQ will fall a lot more in 2019

So

Much

577 2018-12-31 21:21:54 Not why stocks crashed. Market is moving again so Fed raised the funds rate to curb inflation. Anyone who is remotely financially literate knows this has little to do with the mythical trade war. Especially considering tensions have decreased as of late.

People often buy alts because they are "cheaper." and Bitcoin-s are "too expensive." Stocks split to deal with this perception problem. This Basically creates a new denomination

630 2018-12-31 21:14:36 I can’t wait to calc my performance for the year (just posted NOV yesterday). I moved halfway out of stocks with decent timing and into short bonds and commodities.

824 2018-12-31 20:58:41 One financial adviser friend of mine told me that I shouldn't even look at the account until we're closer to the point where it matters. And that at that point it's time to start moving the money out of stocks anyway.

827 2018-12-31 20:56:43 We just had the longest bull market ever. I realize that's not a complete argument, but I will suggest that gains in stocks going forward are likely mostly driven by inflation of the money supply. You see it in countries where the central bank went off the rails like ours has.

835 2018-12-31 20:52:10 The one thing I know about stocks is that I have no idea when they will go up or down. Income averaging in a broad market index fund is my only strategy.

855 2018-12-31 20:41:54 The real problem with bump stocks and similar devices is that they exist to circumvent the full auto weapon ban via a technicality in the law. Their purpose is to violate the ban, that alone should make them illegal. ATF was asleep at the wheel when they approved them.

863 2018-12-31 20:37:40 I guess- technically with my 401k- I am continuing to buy. And because I'm in my 40's the downturn will work in my favor in that I will be purchasing more stocks with the same monthly contribution and long term they will be worth more. But if I were near retirement? I'd sell.

876 2018-12-31 20:28:18 There was a 20% correction during the 1982-2000 secular bull when there was the 1987 crash. Additionally, the S&P 500 fell 19.8% during Clinton's impeachment trial in 1998. Stocks recovered from both.
877 2018-12-31 20:27:29 US stocks set to post worst year in a decade with the S&P 500 down more than 6%. Wall Street concluded a tumultuous 2018 on Monday as the major stock indexes were on track to post their worst yearly performances since the financial crisis.
878 2018-12-31 20:27:29 US stocks set to post worst year in a decade with the S&P 500 down more than 6%.

882 2018-12-31 20:25:39 US stocks set to post worst year in a decade with the S&P 500 down more than 6%Pretty much sums up your presidency
883 2018-12-31 20:25:05 This Year may your hair and teeth, your face-lift, abs and stocks not fall, may your blood pressure, your cholesterol, white blood count and mortgage interest not rise. Happy New Year!
884 2018-12-31 20:24:17 You never played practice games with your friends? You can grind more in a match with more stocks without having to go thru the menu again
885 2018-12-31 20:22:18 Please keep being fools, and keep buying Stocks while going into 2019's major slowdown... Thanks!
886 2018-12-31 20:22:07 We need to bring back stocks and canes ...that will get their attention
887 2018-12-31 20:22:01 u could have slept the entire year and been better off. #stocks
888 2018-12-31 20:21:24 Oh honey... I’m not the pussy asking for walls.  I don’t fear the scary brown man.  And I’m not invested in steel or security stocks...sooooo  what was your point again?
889 2018-12-31 20:21:22 @realDonaldTrump US stocks set to post worst year in a decade.  So much winning
890 2018-12-31 20:18:25 Very few combos are consistent I think, witch time despite having lag can net stocks very early compared to a lot of the cast. Bat within is still bs especially when other characters only get 1 air dodge.

893 2018-12-31 20:15:40 #trade Stocks up on trade hopes

Stocks are feeling festive on this New Year’s Eve with all three major indexes in the green.
894 2018-12-31 20:14:58 They've sold out of the stocks they bought prior to tariffs taking effect and now really are feeling the impacts of tariffs? I mean, I understand wanting to stick to the "tariffs aren't hurting anyone" narrative but at some point, added cost is going to be passed on.
895 2018-12-31 20:14:36 "Avenge, O Lord, thy slaughtered saints, whose bones
Lie scattered on the Alpine mountains cold,
Even them who kept thy truth so pure of old,
When all our fathers worshiped stocks and stones;
Forget not: in thy book record their groans"
Milton "On the Late Massacre in Piedmont"
896 2018-12-31 20:13:34 And every time our country buys one of those, how much do the employee stocks go up that our new Secretary of Defense has from Boeing?
897 2018-12-31 20:13:16 Stocks zig-zag ahead of the year's close

899 2018-12-31 20:11:49 2 winners today $UPL and $WFT both penny stocks, it’s looking tempting to long these stocks ngl
900 2018-12-31 20:10:35 Thanks for the great summaries of these particular value stocks. Your invaluable information and input is very much appreciated. HNY to you and the TMS family . K. R Tops
901 2018-12-31 20:10:25 Considering stocks & bonds in 18 that’s not saying much
902 2018-12-31 20:10:06 I've only had it for 5 days n I took two stocks off him before this clip so yea lmfaoo
903 2018-12-31 20:09:09 Stocks back at session highs after news that the gov't shutdown may end with border funding in the bill. Dow +250 points.
904 2018-12-31 20:08:33 What stocks are you watching or buying? Or do you only short stocks? Thanks
905 2018-12-31 20:08:25 He clearly is playing on 5 stocks in his video. So you are both incorrect when you say that no one plays 5 stocks.
906 2018-12-31 20:07:47 Equal weighting stocks or sectors?
907 2018-12-31 20:07:36 Remind me, how are stocks year to date?
908 2018-12-31 20:07:19 Please give us our bump-fire stocks back.

910 2018-12-31 20:06:35 Nyetimber will run out. We will have to drink the remaining stocks of black tower and blue nun. After that there will only be R Whites lemonade.
911 2018-12-31 20:06:30 no, he is lying and he is in a position to manipulate the markets, every lie and Brexit nonsense he utters causes the £ to fall and has an adverse effect on UK stocks ( not those of companies dependent on foreign earnings, but those dependent on domestic earnings) WAKE UP
912 2018-12-31 20:05:55 CelticFC will continue to delight and disappoint me for years to come! Like the Cubs and Vikings!
You lot are far more likely for the stocks than annoyingly pleasant, Moi!

915 2018-12-31 20:04:46 Shocking that joint members of the EU are seeing drops in stocks during a period great political uncertainty. Well aware of US-China tensions too. But if your defence is ‘what about them’ then good luck to you. And the Dolt remark is unnecessary. As is the phrase misguided twat..
916 2018-12-31 20:04:08 Can you trade stocks from REHab?

920 2018-12-31 20:02:25 @pixabay Awesome stocks of photo!! A suggestion if you don't mind: pics appears on tiles, which are small in size. Click it to watch it big in another page, now need to hit back button and repeat. Wouldn't a slide show kind be better exp. like google images (w. bigger size)?
921 2018-12-31 20:01:31 What is your January view of SPX? I love the puts on select stocks. Am I right you see the early January trend up?
922 2018-12-31 20:01:04 ** Advice wanted from financially savvy people.** 

How and where should I be saving monthly? What % of the savings should I be contributing to 1) a standard savings account or 2) into the stock market via Robinhood? 

Note: If stocks, please advise on *what* to buy.
923 2018-12-31 20:00:26 Not all , only the peolle benefitted by his party, I can say from MO, his tarrifs are hurting MO farmers, I don't know why he would even want to take credit for the economy anyways, he baned bump stocks, he could have done more for PR & VI, he doesn't stand for sex worker rights
924 2018-12-31 20:00:13 Stocks are shares of a particular company that that company sells to the public.
925 2018-12-31 19:59:54 The race for profit has inflated the stocks worldwide for decades, look at the movie 'the big short' then apply those wheeler dealer tricks to the world market.. How much on paper actually does not exist, implosion imminent. Or a large war, either or.
926 2018-12-31 19:59:38 Canadian National Railway (TSX:CNR)(NYSE:CNI)

CN is one of those stocks investors can buy on weakness and simply forget for 30 years. The company serves an integral role in the operation of the Canadian and U.S. economies and recent investments in new locomotives!
927 2018-12-31 19:58:39 pick stocks of companies that will address climate change.  Dems coming to power.  they will raise corp taxes and incentivize clean energy.   Pay attention!   SPX likely down over next two years.
928 2018-12-31 19:58:15 All my stocks are crashing and burning today  #fuckme #stilltime #itcanonlygoup #anotherone #stocks #robinhood
929 2018-12-31 19:58:05 Stocks tend to move stronger in the direction of the general market but what do I know I’m nobody 
930 2018-12-31 19:58:04 Thats actually one of the reasons to believe that stocks could have a very good decade or two in front of them. Consider we are through the major tech revolution that brought high efficiency & high margins, easy monetary policy/low rates and stocks returned this.
931 2018-12-31 19:57:36 CNBC subhead (mute is on) informs me that stocks are up on renewed trade hopes.  Whoever wrote this is not looking at the "China trade" stocks, which are actually lagging.  Nightly news will probably say the same.  If two things are happening at the same time, infer causation.
932 2018-12-31 19:57:34 $SPY the market favors higher but that does not mean it will make things easy. sometimes things will go smoothly and sometimes not ,but the key is  solid plans and sticking to the rules in order to catch the gains. I have done this so many times with stocks like $AMZN $AAPL $BA
933 2018-12-31 19:57:23 Seasonally this is when they often run the hardest - Some bottoming signals in many of the names i track. Mania type run every year or so on average in microcap us pot stocks .. can make a whole year by being positioned right time in right plays. Only trades, short time frame.
934 2018-12-31 19:57:10 So @charl_stocks is super poorly so can’t go out for NYE so I turn up at hers with matching pjs, chocolate, wine, face masks and ordering Chinese to keep her company
935 2018-12-31 19:56:52 Nothing has been kind jr. This year destroyed alot of people stocks and crypto.
936 2018-12-31 19:56:51 I dont trade markets I trade stocks

938 2018-12-31 19:55:00 Did #Emmerdale just gift us with a possible friendship between Faith and Ma Stocks? Could they be the next generation Betty and Edna?
939 2018-12-31 19:54:46  50% or maybe more don't own stocks,i think... Hehe they're probably chuckling just watching gas prices go down
940 2018-12-31 19:54:31 Very good point and would add that it is often best to make Tax-loss sales around Thanksgiving so you can usually buy in Late Deember when stocks are on (tax-loss) sale. More optionality and one can estimate what gains may be and just meet them
941 2018-12-31 19:54:06 Just out of curiousity. Why so bullish on microcap 420 stocks?
942 2018-12-31 19:53:48 As a regular traveller to France, I've noticed the duty-free shop stocks a lot of cuddly toys. There is no tax on cuddly toys and smugglers in  Cornwall during the olden days did nit avoid revenue men to bring teddies and fluffy rabbits into UK.
943 2018-12-31 19:52:57 They never said they weren't. They've been talking all along. Nice headline though. Maybe my stocks will go up.
944 2018-12-31 19:51:40 Correlation ≠ causation.
In this case, it's not the lower yields that reduce growth, but rather the lower growth expectations push both yields and stocks lower.
945 2018-12-31 19:51:27 That sums up all of crypto and an asston of stocks this year.
946 2018-12-31 19:50:54 look close how dow going little bit down and bitcoin follows :D we are dependent on stocks for now :)
947 2018-12-31 19:50:51 This is not securities offering - stocks, bonds, etc. FAQ will be clearer. Thanks for the question.
948 2018-12-31 19:50:11 If you were long US utilities, US managed care, and short-term Treasuries while short Chinese technology, Japanese maritime stocks, and euro-zone banks, congratulations on a successful 2018!  Happy New Year, everyone.
949 2018-12-31 19:49:44 Gold will hold its own due to Russian/Chinese buying and the EU banks. FOMC hikes 1 more time IF data stay where it's at thru June. Agree on $TLT...Stocks? see #1.

951 2018-12-31 19:48:07 Just a reminder,

Don't sell stocks for losses if U have Dividends reinvested into new shares. 
That would create a wash sale & disallow you to take the loss for 2018

Wait 31 days to be safe

$NVDA paid a Dividend on 12/21

Happy New Year !

957 2018-12-31 19:45:15 The key to success on Watch List stocks is loading at year bottom prices in depth, holding cheapest shares the longest & trading higher cost basis lots to convert cheapest to free. Priorities if you can't do them all: $IJJP $EVSV $APRU $AHIX
958 2018-12-31 19:45:06 (1/2) The model I like to sort of simplify the notion of what goes o­n in a market for common stocks is the pari-mutuel system at the racetrack... a pari-mutuel system is a market. Everybody goes there and bets and the odds change based o­n what's bet.
959 2018-12-31 19:44:52 Anyone saying new TFSA room coming in Jan is potential “lots of new money to rush to stocks” deserves to be blocked/muted. Less than 2% of Canadians have maxed out their TFSA. There won’t be some massive rush of TFSA buying bcoz 98% simply aren’t maxed out anyway #hopium

963 2018-12-31 19:43:24 This year, I’ve learned that macro issues affect micro stocks. That’s why it’s worth paying attention the macro trends. 

What have you learned in 2018?

 #whatdid2018teachyou
964 2018-12-31 19:43:11 No Deal = Any agreements instantly become void which means that legally the EU cannot ship us goods even if we want them. That means either agree "equivalence" i.e "agree to whatever terms are handed to us" as we will not have time to negotiate b4 stocks run out or People Die.
965 2018-12-31 19:42:23 Remember everybody, we can have differing opinions on stocks/companies/politics/anything and still be friendly! My new years resolution is to spread this message and practice what I preach. All the best to you, Harry

Save ya $$$ now so u can be comfortable and  so you’ll be able to invest when the value of stocks/real estate etc goes down.

987 2018-12-31 19:32:53 I love the 1/3 approach 

1/3 of ANYTHING I make goes into an investment account that I use to make investments when ready (RE, Stocks, Assets)

1/3 goes into low interest safe savings accounts 

1/3 is for fun and charity 

Velocity of money, it’ll keep growing itself
988 2018-12-31 19:32:42 I recall a sci-fi novel which depicted a future where the UN administers the oceans to conserve stocks and that was wtitten about 1966. That's the direction we need to go. It was Frederick Pohl that generation. Not Heinlein.
989 2018-12-31 19:32:33 Portfolio saver I like that word.

Truthfully though how many got greedy at stocks like ARS & profits turned into big losses?

Just by pure luck & nothing else I had to sell ARS just before the collapse.

Lesson from 2018 don't be greedy learn to sell.

1015 2018-12-31 19:18:39 And we still don't have a chief of staff, attorney general, defense secretary, stocks are just beginning to pick back up after hitting record lows, and an ill-tempered, ignorant, uninformed  jackass who sits in office who depends on your type of ignorance to keep him there.

1022 2018-12-31 19:16:03 We're both splitting hairs -> "Composite Index", as S&P 500 was first called when it introduced its first stock index in 1923, began tracking a small number of stocks. 3 years later in 1926, the Composite Index expanded to 90 stocks and then in 1957 it expanded ... current 500."

1026 2018-12-31 19:12:31 Which is why as a player, he tilts the fuck outta me wether im playing as wario or he is my opponent. I do think it'll be a less centralising move since wario's moveset as a whole is more usefull and characters can take stocks easier in general
1027 2018-12-31 19:12:02 I can't decide what's dumber this "worst" and "best" stuff comparing say Obama and Trump to Nixon or Hoover or Washington or Lincoln or saying biggest ever with debt or stocks or taxes using nominal dollars. Why feed this insanity?

I am finding that most of my profits come from $AMZN & a handful of others. There is something to be said for becoming an expert on a couple stocks and how they move.
1036 2018-12-31 19:07:36 FYI, trump approved law banning bump stocks! Are you not aware?
1037 2018-12-31 19:07:31 Let’s see, people who are on call to run a business where they are responsible for thousands of people are unfairly paid more and given bonuses by their bosses (the stockholders) than the guy that stocks sheets on the shelves?

1065 2018-12-31 18:54:07 Gold ends New Year's Eve and 2018 in the red, but books 7% quarterly gain as stocks swoon
1066 2018-12-31 18:53:37 Higher long term yields are the result of higher economic growth and higher inflation which stocks love, always have. Corporate bonds also trade with narrower credit spreads and fixed income investors get higher yielding portfolios
1067 2018-12-31 18:53:14 Short stocks, buy silver, trade shitcoins.

1078 2018-12-31 18:51:23 Either way there are some stocks out there that could see SIGNIFICANT re-pricings of 100's of Bilions in MSRs and Billions in MBS--Agency and private.

1085 2018-12-31 18:49:46 Us "numb nuts" realize what you evidently do not: that there are some stocks that own HIGHLY levered (neg) exposure to ANY increase in CPRs for ANY reason. Could be lower rate refi incentive, could be they are unable to pay the mortgage.
1086 2018-12-31 18:49:40 If there is any justice - this will be used in evidence against you when thousands lose their jobs, there are shortages and our industry collapses...while you have been making a fortune shorting Sterling and UK stocks. In your case, the charge should be 'treason'
1087 2018-12-31 18:49:38 $PBYI The only reason I’m not trading this is because I’m afraid that when I sell, it’ll be bought. Then again, I’m missing out other stocks

1093 2018-12-31 18:45:42 he lies. He makes a fortune shorting Sterling and UK stocks and is trying to escape the coming tax clampdown (ATAD). He knows there will be mass unemployment and that most people will be worse off and does not care. You have been duped
1094 2018-12-31 18:44:23 retail stocks looking good for 2019. might want to buy now.
1095 2018-12-31 18:44:16 trashing the UK economy and making a fortune by shorting UK stocks and Sterling ?

1112 2018-12-31 18:39:07 While I fully support Warren and Sanders, I don’t believe they are the right choice for 2020. They have both been labeled as extremists and laughing stocks by the Trump Administration. Trump can easily be defeated as long as we find the right opponent.
1113 2018-12-31 18:38:50 Google Texas housing in the late 70's early 80's- Danny Faulkner. The did the same thing with the same level of corruption as Vancouver and it didn't work for them either. Every time there is a bubble be it in housing stocks, or tulips, there is and inevitable collapse.

1131 2018-12-31 18:30:40 How's that 1.5 trillion dollar tax plan doing? Mnuchin said it will pay for itself. The people were supposed to get a $1,600 tax cut. What happened to that? On the tax cut paying for itself. It's not happening. Biggest winners are people with stocks. No jobs, no income boost.

1135 2018-12-31 18:27:38 The level of audacity it takes for a Cheney to talk foreign policy is mindblowing. Your dad belongs in Leavenworth penitentiary.

1136 2018-12-31 18:27:34 As shares on the mainland were pummeled, Hong Kong stocks performed a bit better. The Hang Seng index notched a decline of only 13.61 percent for 2018.
1137 2018-12-31 18:27:30 My calls for 2019:

1) Powell continues to hike. 1 maybe 2 hikes. Continues to sell balance sheet.
2) Stocks do poorly but not a crazy crash. Maybe down 5%.
3) $tlt bounces around but does little
4) Gold and silver do well as US fiscal situation gets laughably bad
1138 2018-12-31 18:26:09 Trump banned bump stocks. That’s the only movement forward. We need mental health checks for new purchasers and for all liberals.

1141 2018-12-31 18:25:08 This year has not been a great one for Chinese stocks. In fact, it's been the worst in a decade.

The Shanghai composite, the mainland's major share average, ended the trading year at 2,493.90 — that was approximately 24.6 percent lower than its final close of 2017.

1156 2018-12-31 18:19:38 Dick Cheney belongs in Leavenworth penitentiary. PERIOD. He is a devil on earth. A slaughterer of millions. A monster who values oil, MIC stocks and no-bid contracts above human lives. He is pure, unadulterated evil. Why do we let the insane cowards like him lord over us?
1157 2018-12-31 18:19:22 Interest sensitive stocks. Fed raised a total of 1% but stocks like $TRP.CA $BCE.CA $POW.CA $KEY.CA took it on the chin. Yields on these & others look so juicy particularly if you believe the Fed and Bank of CDA are done, or almost done. In 2018, there really was nowhere to hide
1158 2018-12-31 18:19:21 WRONG Huckapoo !  Stocks are at 1% YTD, worst year since 2008. Inflation is outpacing minimal wage gains. National debt exploding. Rich getting richer, health care costs skyrocketing. Investor confidence down. Home sales down... I could go on and on and on....
1159 2018-12-31 18:18:52 My stocks been going up 
1160 2018-12-31 18:18:01 Saying he is afraid of attack and that fortification is for the town's protection, the bully stocks up weapons and puts the key in the door. @realDonaldTrump #wakeupAmerica #14thAmendment #uspolitics
1161 2018-12-31 18:17:54 There was a time when rising yields indicated increased demand for money and would send stocks higher. Then debt became the fuel of choice for growth and distorted everything.

1163 2018-12-31 18:16:18 I am of the understanding that much of the development would in fact be outside london for the very reasons you state, however there is plenty of scope for redevelopment of existing housing stocks even in london.

1166 2018-12-31 18:14:29 What is this? I keep seeing it pop up. Basically buying shares but the footballers are the stocks? Play with real money?

1168 2018-12-31 18:14:08 And, of course, the organisations / states that the terrorists and madmen represent would have to stop / agree to never start manufacturing their own.

1189 2018-12-31 18:07:20 If only those who believed in Chris C’s model, when stocks were a lot closer to the highs, could have protected themselves in advance from “what we consider to be an abnormally large drawdown for the model”  :)
1190 2018-12-31 18:07:10 Here’s how ugly 2018 was for stocks and other assets
1191 2018-12-31 18:07:05 @TheFibDoctor I think fibs have ,obvious,value for the prediction of stocks individually but not for the big hits.
1192 2018-12-31 18:06:44 That is tragic as are all the mass shootings that have been committed by US citizens. When will something be done passing stricter gun laws? Banning bump stocks is a small start. Never do we hear a peep out of Repubs when school children are slaughtered by someone legally here.
1193 2018-12-31 18:05:44 Another suspect rally in stocks as U.S. 10-year yield drops another 4 bps to 2.68%! Since the rebound in stocks after Christmas bonds have rallied as the 10-year yield has dropped over 6bps! Makes no sense.
1194 2018-12-31 18:04:34 The Dow is up  +210.97 (0.91%) led by Boeing and Goldman. 
Netflix and Amazon up, Facebook and Alphabet down. 
Psychologically good to close the year in the green but cant forget most stocks are trading significantly lower (Netflix down 37% of its high)
1195 2018-12-31 18:04:25 I went to a hardware store, read a newspaper and sold stocks today. Hi, it’s me. Your new Dad.
1196 2018-12-31 18:03:50 Damage from fiat isn't limited to PP of fiat or even the monetary system. The entire capital and ethical structures of society are distorted. Inflation is seen in stocks, real estate, demographics, health and proxy wars. "Good job of being stable"? How absurd. @VitalikButerin
1197 2018-12-31 18:03:17 Who was/is right? POLL: Candidate Trump or President Trump? Candidate Trump called the stock market a "bubble," and said that the Fed. was way behind the curve raising rates. President Trump wants you to buy stocks and have the Fed. keep suppressing rates. So which is it and why?
1198 2018-12-31 18:03:15 Great thread Dan. I got hammered thinking the stocks I had weren't correlated. Wrong. Everything hit. No choice but to hold thru at this point
1199 2018-12-31 18:02:16 in 8 months of trading stocks and options. the lesson I've learned that's gave me the best results is patience waiting for set ups. i have a small account so pdt has helped with this practice.

1215 2018-12-31 17:55:42 ceo says chicken chow mein and special fried rice, stocks increase in value by 348%
1216 2018-12-31 17:55:35 You are correct. And every time yields were falling to new lows this cycle (2011-2012) and (2015-2016) stocks were trading lower and were seeing numerous 10% corrections. Stocks want growth and inflation, not lower yields brought upon by the lack thereof
1217 2018-12-31 17:55:29 TIAA says "no signs of slowing" in 4th quarter 2018. sticking to pro-growth stocks. you need a new 401k i think.

NEW YORK (AP) — The latest on developments in financial markets (all times local):
1232 2018-12-31 17:50:17 US Stocks

December 24 delivered he largest ever Christmas Eve decline for both the S&P 500 (-2.7%) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-2.9%). $spx, $spy, $indu, $dia
1233 2018-12-31 17:49:43 Stocks buoyed by trade hopes in last session of a dismal 2018
1234 2018-12-31 17:49:05 Same with unemployment numbers, he used to claim were fake. But one might argue he does it, flip-flopping, to get back at Dems. Remember, Dems were saying no one can improve 'full employment' economy; stocks will tumble under Trump, GDP cannot grow more than 1.5-2%, etc.
1235 2018-12-31 17:48:52 The only way for socialism to work is for oil refineries and Haliburton to have employee owned stocks.

1237 2018-12-31 17:47:17 Well, we did a terrific job of conservation when it was all our own business -- fished out the N. Sea cod & the herring stocks, fished Atlantic salmon to bits too. We have also done a great job of allowing UK quotas to be snuffled up by a few large businesses. You are confident..
1238 2018-12-31 17:46:43 $PRGO, $DISH, $F, $NKTR, and $FCX are the top five stocks lower at noon today.

1241 2018-12-31 17:45:38 $NFLX, $ABMD, $INCY, $CF, and $REGN are the top five stocks higher at noon today.
1242 2018-12-31 17:45:37 Is it possible that lower yields are lower for a reason? Like slowing growth and inflation, maybe. Look at the VIX. It's 26+. Since when do stocks "grind higher" with a 26 VIX? Sure, it can come down, but can it go back to the 10-15 area?
1243 2018-12-31 17:45:25 Funny to watch the dividend guys celebrate when almost every one of their stocks is down on the year

Dividends aren’t magical, they’re paid out of company cash just like everything else - capital appreciation matters otherwise it’s just a risky bond
1244 2018-12-31 17:44:30 $GE, $AMD, $F, $BAC, and $T are the top five most active stocks at noon today.
1245 2018-12-31 17:44:17 Stocks close slightly higher, trimming earlier gains
1246 2018-12-31 17:43:31 Obama didn't "make it legally to purchase bump stocks..." [sic]
The NRA controlled GOP congress obstructed everything he tried to do.
Trump had all three branches of gov't for two years, and didn't even try.
You seem to be very confused.

1268 2018-12-31 17:31:37 Expert fund managers are paying record prices for UK stocks, the ultimate barometer on future returns and sentiment. But you know better........
1269 2018-12-31 17:30:57 When the government picks which side to support in this deleveraging game it is socialism. Let's help people with stocks. What about people in bonds? What about people in cash? QE was a short term fix and now is being removed. Let chips fall where they may.
1270 2018-12-31 17:30:44 His audience for this will be huge. A lot of people think those kids should just stfu and leave their bump stocks alone. It’s sad. I don’t look foreword to seeing how well this works for him.
1271 2018-12-31 17:30:24 So glad to hear @AOC talk about congresspeople being able to trade stocks on non-public information. @SenGillibrand tried to push restrictions on it a while back. Would love to see my two favorite home-state pols tackle it together!

1280 2018-12-31 17:25:22 LOL...$MSRT is one of the worst performing and managed stocks of all time.  Bernie Madoff would do a better job running this scam.  Financials are pathetic, stock always is promoted and has Barry Honig’s fingerprints in the scam.  Much better REAL companies in the space.

1284 2018-12-31 17:24:25 Central bank intervention , money printing twattery affects stocks , the markets couldn't careless about politics or the french rioting . Politics has become too partisan anyway , the traders are more interested in Italian bond rates than opinions of so called experts.
1285 2018-12-31 17:24:22 The incoming house members plan on resistance and impeachment, this doesn’t bode well with the economy. Much of the price of stocks is based on speculation. It’s probably smart to shift your money into safer havens.

1297 2018-12-31 17:16:24 But investors are often average people too, who have put their own retirement hopes in the stocks they have. And if this company didn’t have such generous pensions (which basically don’t exist in the private sector anymore), it might have continued existing.
1298 2018-12-31 17:15:40 Pension funds have to sell bonds and buy stocks right? Bond market closes at 2pm today and equity markets open until 4pm. I dont see much bond selling. $tlt $Spy

1301 2018-12-31 17:14:36 If you look at current position of the market and say put HSFO at 2020 price prediction, running medium sour makes the most sense. And this is a year before IMO with gasoline stocks building and diesel falling globally. Could get nasty the spread between gasoline and diesel

Spike in level of uncertainty & rising level of external shocks are key factors.

1321 2018-12-31 17:08:01 Inflation? Who knows. I don't think the FED cares. 3 more hikes if stocks (financials) stay up, otherwise less probably. Short rates here to stay (2.50-2.75) REPO spreads wider. 10 year sub 2%. Thats my prediction.
1322 2018-12-31 17:07:13 I heard again a lot of commercials to buy stocks, but they are very high at the moment imho. Be careful!
1323 2018-12-31 17:06:48 I didn’t even look at the list. I don’t read year end predictions, for that matter. I’m an adult stock person with a (possible?) degree in film. I’m not the audience for “10 hot stocks now” or must-see art flicks. It’s just a good day for listing things.

1347 2018-12-31 16:57:12 Stocks blasted over 30% higher from early 2016-2018 as the 10yr yield rose from 1.35% to 3.25%. It’s not the yield that matters, it’s the economy. Higher growth, higher inflation = higher yields = higher stocks. Lower yields and lower stocks is the pain trade, always has been

1357 2018-12-31 16:52:29 Do your research. Our entire corporate and gov't pension system is broke. They're too heavily invested in volatile stocks and real estate. They are unsustainable. If we have a market correction, they will be devastated. Pensioners need a Plan B. The #PBGC will not cover losses.
1358 2018-12-31 16:52:22 Absolutely right ivy, as you said once “most Crypto/tokens are not stocks/securities”

So neither they are securities nor currencies beyond their platform’s eco system (I refer to utility tokens)

Offcourse if the platform grows its eco system, these currencies may gain value

1365 2018-12-31 16:48:53 “With losses hitting markets from stocks to commodities to bonds, many investors say they have reined in their optimism heading into the new year. That is especially true with data suggesting that growth around the world is starting to falter.”

1369 2018-12-31 16:47:53 I can't see how U.S. stocks can keep rallying with substantially higher yields. Lower yields are more likely to be supportive of risk assets unless accompanied by a recession. Higher yields will cause credit markets to reprice lower & will compress corporate margins, etc

1381 2018-12-31 16:42:49 I say this alot. But it's the truth. To know that 2 + 2=4 is good. To know WHY 2 + 2 =4 is knowledge that is transferable. OWN the concept and you can apply it to other situations. (including stocks!)   #stocks

1383 2018-12-31 16:41:53 Agreed. But the S&P 500's 2018 GAAP PE will finish in the 18s. (The media-friendly non-GAAP one will be MUCH lower.) So stocks are FAR from a bubble based on TTM, and thus even if 2019 earnings are down 10% stocks aren't "crazy" here. Of course, if the recession is BAD, I'm wrong
1384 2018-12-31 16:41:24 This is true. Since most of the big ones are publicly traded, the only way to really hurt them is through their stocks. People need to start dumping them.

Especially when compared to stocks like GE, DB, or SNAP. Not that anyone suggesting crypto gets a pass, just in perspective it wasn’t the only miss of 2018.
1441 2018-12-31 16:17:18 It was either encourage the ATF to revisit their initial assessment of bump stocks OR allow Congress to get involved with legislation that most likely would have banned ALL semi-auto firearms if passed.

1506 2018-12-31 15:47:47 Most in rural America pay almost no attention to Wall Street. Now the CBOE and the CME might be of more interest a that is where their products are traded. Rural Americans, with money, own land, not stocks. Most rural Americans own almost nothing at all.
1507 2018-12-31 15:47:28 Then why aren’t you leading the fight against the Jersey magazine ban and bump stocks? I just read “shall not be infringed “ yesterday.

1509 2018-12-31 15:45:55 Gold started the day strong, oil started the day strong. But both were faded by the State because they only want stocks & bonds to go up. But as we learned from @LukeGromen this is not going to work until you set gold free, and let USD go down. Stocks already starting to fade.
1510 2018-12-31 15:45:30 Crypto currently correlates positively with speculative assets like stocks. IMO the fact that the inverse correlation between DXY and stocks flipped positive just before xmas is one of the signs that this may snowball into a full-blown global economic crisis.

1523 2018-12-31 15:40:01 It's hard to kill a long term trend so I tend to go with history. I'm all about rooting for the underdog but you can go broke doing that in stocks. I prefer to buy the strongest mkt player when a sector is weak as a whole. We'll see. If the sector does well, they'll all do well
1524 2018-12-31 15:40:00 Thanks for checking out my site.  If you sort by Stage 4 you can find the sectors with the highest percentage of stocks in a downtrend. From there I would start looking at the charts of the stocks to find the best setups.

1570 2018-12-31 15:23:49 He very clearly surmised that stocks must NOT be allowed to crash. Because it will cause unnecessary depression across rural America, making it all the worse. I believe he's sold this mantra to central banks across the globe, that "whatever it takes" is the prudent thing to do.
1571 2018-12-31 15:23:46 Thanks. It's a 6 year old portfolio where the core stocks have hardly changed. So easier to outperform..
1572 2018-12-31 15:23:41 Well, stocks are considerably more expensive than they were in 2007. So yes, there should be more stress if you focus on stocks. For other financial markets, which is what the FED monitors more closely, the situation is not that bad.

1595 2018-12-31 15:15:04 biz surveys are (still) optimistic = soft data has to be confirmed by hard data later anyway. Maybe close to cycle end. The stock market is not the economy.

1597 2018-12-31 15:13:56 Now that 80% of stocks are owned by 1% of people, it would be more accurate if the cops were the 1%, and she's the rest of us!

1657 2018-12-31 14:47:48 I won't say I think. I will say invest in stocks only if u understand buisness (buisness of company in which u r investing) else invest periodically in index in sip form for long term atleast for 10 - 15years. Understand this stock market investment is passive income we try to

1730 2018-12-31 14:13:17 Stock markets don't simply fall 20% only to rebound another 20%.

1731 2018-12-31 14:11:10 No, not money - stock certificates.  Billionaires are not “fighting” the president, and tanking their own stocks would be a dumb way to fight him.  They have no incentive to fight him because they are the beneficiaries of his huge tax cut for the rich and corporations.

1783 2018-12-31 13:34:53 There are penny stock traders who do advanced technical analysis and play them like violins, but compared to the ones who get attention they're shrouded in obscurity. I still think it takes 20 times more work to make much less overall profit yield potential doing penny stocks tho
1784 2018-12-31 13:33:49 today is the last trading day of the year. tax loss selling and account propping games. meaning they run stocks to print the stock high to mark their accounts as being healthier than it may really be.

so may be some wacky moves. stay disciplined as usual

1787 2018-12-31 13:31:49 I think Powell’s plan is to try to slowly deflate this stock bubble. He realizes that he can’t allow this one to pop so he’s strategically altering liquidity at times where markets are up to assure that valuations don’t get too elevated. He wants stocks flat next few years.

1792 2018-12-31 13:30:15 December 31st is usually the best day of the year to buy #MLPs in order to take advantage of the strong January effect.

1793 2018-12-31 13:29:57 Using this rally to sell any equity holding I do not want to carry as a full or even half position.  I'm around 5% long stocks and may hedge these by shorting some low quality crap soon.  Normally I would want to carry 10-25% long stocks but haven't seen a lot of value since 2015
1794 2018-12-31 13:29:31 Def the 3 stocks
1795 2018-12-31 13:29:21 Stock plans give you the leverage that leads to wealth. However I have also seen people pay taxes on unrealized stock wealth and eventually lose all of it. Also, a lot of co’s get their stocks underwater, and then fall back on cash plans of some sort, that have no leverage.

1816 2018-12-31 13:13:42 Yes I used sarcasm. Your analogy was blatantly disingenuous. A gun wouldn’t have stopped him. However a routine traffic stop did prevent him from carrying out another deed.

1820 2018-12-31 13:07:36 Trump needs to understand that any fake news tweets only makes the selling worse when the lie is exposed. It also makes stocks shook up which speeds up the Fed’s rate hike plans.

1883 2018-12-31 12:13:04 A Stock move from Rs100 to Rs200 in Y1 & back to Rs140 in Y2 becomes a pain point vs Rs115 in Y1 & Rs140 in Y2. CY17, 91% of BSE 200 stocks were up, while 66% stocks of were down in CY18. Net only 26% of stocks were down between CY16-18, Yet sentiment is weak due to CY17 upmove

1885 2018-12-31 12:09:37 Ten stocks for 2019: What the pros are picking to outperform in the year ahead

The bull market ran into a brick wall in 2018, but that doesn’t mean investors should abandon equities just yet. With a new year dawning, the Financial Post asked 10 prominent portfolio managers …

1890 2018-12-31 12:06:11 It would be great if details on who is getting cash on border security. I suspect dems have stocks or interest in tech companies. Give dems a bone and let them get a piece of wall pie so they don't cry so much. It's always about money. Wall works in San Diego for sure

1894 2018-12-31 12:02:04 Dow Jones futures are up 260 points this morning at 7:00, b/c  Trump said trade deal with China is progressing well. If you're banking on the lier-n-chief, jump in now. Stocks are finding resistance at the 10 day, think I'd wait for some to break through

1899 2018-12-31 11:57:12 Bump stocks should never been legal in the firstplace. You should concentrate on what's needed and quit crying on making more laws when you don't enforce the ones we have.
1900 2018-12-31 11:56:13 " Well, over the short-term (1-year), it's hard to know.

1906 2018-12-31 11:51:21 I’d focus, instead of numbers on a reasonable combat capability for armored divisions. Obviously it means tanks but it also means, IFVs, Tubes, attack helicopters and infantry (pioneers, engineers, Mech). Russia has deep stocks but not deep pockets or deep personnel.

1912 2018-12-31 11:44:28 Agree with the first three - sell off then bounce on trade news - but rest of the year to see more of the same - usd higher overall and USA stocks end the year lower - read my lips no new highs

1916 2018-12-31 11:42:32 I agree with you Elie...but ECB is well behind Fed in QT and raising rates and all investors know what does this mean for stocks: less inflows and more outflows. Global slowdown also affects Euro negatively disproportionally...

1922 2018-12-31 11:36:43 2019 is it really a new year? 
Politicians not working for the people because oh ya campaigning for 2020 too important.

Impeachment
Stocks market dropping to old levels of 10,000. 
 new year definetly same shit.
1923 2018-12-31 11:36:16 The comparison should be between MSCI EM and Defty.. compairing a USD denominated index to a local currency denominated index will not throw correct output. Another point is that MSCI EM has about 850 stocks in the index. Should we be compairing that to our broder indicies?

1928 2018-12-31 11:31:52 I genuinely believe (and it's already happened with many stocks in a massive way), that some of these yields plays are going to seriously disappoint. People believe in a narrative, because it has worked historically. The utilities for example (london listed), are in shit shape.
1929 2018-12-31 11:30:30 Looking back on 2018 it makes me wish I was still a child,unaware of the utter shit storm is has been. 

Politics has reached a new low,the UK&US are laughing stocks. Facing 2019 with trepidation at what possible horror could be ahead of us.

When will this George Orwell era end?

1952 2018-12-31 11:02:48 Sp500 is one of the most popular investments.  Holders don't keep up on 500 stocks or care which ideas come true and when.  They do notice who is at the top and who they've owned for years, but never heard of.  Komodo mktp < 1% of eth.  Kmd is not on the radar yet like most.

2003 2018-12-31 10:01:20 IMO best console racing game was Dirt to Daytona on ps2.
Hobby stocks
Modifieds
Truck
Cup

Loved that game
2004 2018-12-31 10:00:54 But there is a flaw; little hands could easily slip though the stocks!  You clearly have not thought this through Riddell... 
2005 2018-12-31 10:00:43 Thanks Jane for running with this story. The lobster fishery is a fantastic fishery. The 17.% take by the government is unprecedented in fishery management. We invest in a fishery for the long term  and are willing to take cuts when times are bad to benefit when stocks improve

2010 2018-12-31 09:54:53 But, to be clear, I'm massively in favor of diversification through gold. I'd go as far as 15%. That chart shows nothing if it doesn't show gold and stocks work well together.
2011 2018-12-31 09:54:36 sometimes you have to go with your research and gut feeling. In my mad old days I had 75% and 50% in a couple of shares at different times. One worked one didn't. Wouldn't do it now but I still have  concentrated PF of 10 stocks. Do what works for you

2035 2018-12-31 09:29:17 price at which these stocks were recommended to be bought by a "financial advisor" was eye popping to say the least, all this in spite of trying to alert him about these, well ahead of the catastrophic plummet. At that time he felt that he could "sleep in peace" with these. 2/2
2036 2018-12-31 09:28:47 Hi @jameseonline We can't confirm retailers live stocks! If you have trouble, you can always try online :)

2044 2018-12-31 09:18:33 I do think the $XBI results highlight a few things. Using average gain, $XBI would be $90 off the low or off the top. Using medians, $54 off top and $63 off low. So you must be in stocks for full moves. On valuation, $SPX went up 35-40% from low and 10-15% from high.

2112 2018-12-31 07:55:07 Doctors try to express their concerns, but now they are suspended from duty, no stocks in the market, someone took some snaps of a shop at the Airport and say shops have enough stocks, prices are skyrocketing on almost a daily basis. People are in desperate need for change
2113 2018-12-31 07:53:03 Our population increase is primarily down to legal migration, not asylum seekers. (4,981 people in 2018). 

Legal migrants who pay tax. So if there's a problem, it's with Government failures to invest that money in maintains services, housing stocks etc.

2115 2018-12-31 07:51:18 The engine behind inequality is Rent (as an abstract concept not specific to land). Basically, getting money simply for owning stuff & letting other people use it. Think stocks & bonds and mortgage-backed securities, etc.
2116 2018-12-31 07:50:32 ahahaha 1 Essendon supporter down 1 to go. But yet us being the laughing stock still beat Essendon. ahaha. 1999 the laughing stock knocked the hot favourites out of the Grand final race. Not bad for laughing stocks. And we never resorted to drugs to do it no thats funny.
2117 2018-12-31 07:49:49 What u essentially have is the nse fmcg index. About 80% of that index is just these 2 stocks
2118 2018-12-31 07:49:18 #RRE one of favorite stocks for 2019. Current MC not representative of how far/fast the company has developed. This is mainly due to simple market mechanics. Valuation can not stay this low going forward and with potential for further acquisitions it's an easy hold for 2019 imho
2119 2018-12-31 07:46:46 My worst idea in 2018: diversify a portion of crypto earnings into stocks. 

Luckily I put only 0.21% of my net worth in it.

2137 2018-12-31 07:16:51 Yeah I do that every now and then, unfortunately most cheap Austrian stocks are very cyclical (steel, aluminum, oil/gas, auto). I have a position in Polytec Holding AG since many years and it has become cheap again recently so I added to it. No other buys for me in Austria now.

2142 2018-12-31 07:12:59 "Stocks pin hopes"
Think about that phrase for a second.
Stocks, which are fractions of company ownership, somehow are "pinning their hopes".
Do shares of companies "hope"?
This gets sillier and sillier.
2143 2018-12-31 07:12:04 Is 2019 going to be a good year for Kenyan stocks? Anyone with a good, informed prediction?
2144 2018-12-31 07:08:39 For anyone still hestitating whether to sell your stock portfolio, 2019 is set to look a lot worse than 2018.  Selling today will give you a brighter 2019.  #Markets #Stocks
2145 2018-12-31 07:07:44 Record stocks, employment+pay, ISIS destroyed, great pro-American trade deals, crushing MS13, crushing Russian and Chinese economies, getting Americans home, growth they said was impossible. If you call this 92% negative then we have opposite ethics, morals, and values.
2146 2018-12-31 07:07:24 A Quant saying that certain groups of stocks should outperform sometime in future based on cheap valuations is also forecasting however it's too vague for media even though in all probability  its more reliable and valuable.

Real forecasting is boring.

News is entertainment.

2149 2018-12-31 07:06:13 @QTRResearch BUY STOCKS!
2150 2018-12-31 07:05:56 I think Sears & JCPenny customers should get together & buy up the stocks which are 97c on the dollar now. Then buy the two company names out. Really bad management have caused these two to fall to the bottom of the heap. They never updated how they do things!

2155 2018-12-31 06:56:22 lmfao! This clown actually believes that people who own "bump stocks" are going to "destroy them with a hammer or turn them into the ATF"!!! I can assure you that there will NOT be "$100 million worth of bump stocks destroyed or surrendered". Delusional...

2186 2018-12-31 06:18:11 This is dumb advice.
Here is my advice.                                    #1. Save at least 50% of your income.
#2. Invest in index fund. Do not buy individual stocks.                                  #3. Only buy affordable home to live not as investment.
#4. Be healthy

2205 2018-12-31 06:03:06 Liberals always quick to point the blame! Please be sure to give your extra earnings back from the tax breaks, give away all your stocks that you prospered from and open your home up to an illegal immigrant so they can drive uninsured! #MAGA
2206 2018-12-31 06:01:38 Huge margin debt creates huge sell-offs when stocks begin to break. The cascading failure owing to margin calls could be dramatic. Not sure about the y-axis, however.
2207 2018-12-31 06:01:33 Also interesting to point out how shareholders would act upon a financial downturn. My guess is they are unlikely to wait 3-5 years for the market to turn around, so they would want to IPO before it happens and dump the stocks on retail investors. Then buy back lower. :)
2208 2018-12-31 06:01:29 It's December 31, 2018 at 02:01PM. Does anyone have any interesting #financial #stocks #tech stories to share?
2209 2018-12-31 06:00:53 Well, look at the bright side. They’re not using those $millions to further stockpile bump stocks and assault rifles.

2216 2018-12-31 05:57:23 Asian stocks rose on Monday as hints of progress on the Sino-U.S. trade standoff provided a rare glimmer of optimism in what has been a rough year-end for equities globally.
2217 2018-12-31 05:56:39 Equities need to blow off a lot of steam. Crypto has led the way down and likely has found something close to the bottom. Still potential to go down more but lost most of its heat. It's just a leading indicator for stocks!
2218 2018-12-31 05:55:42 2 Reasons. I have back tested it extensively and feel that with adjustments it is generally Profitable and secondly it's a balance between Risk and Reward. The Premiums on Stocks like those you mentioned do not justify the Risk when they move- which they do occasionally
2219 2018-12-31 05:54:56 I was wondering about that article also bc many are saying there was no evidence that it actually happened. I don’t trust journalists anymore so for all I know it could have been a fabricated story as a cover up.
2220 2018-12-31 05:54:28 The Illusion of Causality. Volatility does not cause multibagger moves. It only preceeds them, in some minor cases. Did we see only the survivor here. Most stocks that fall 80% never see all time high again. Is it better to respond to empirical evidence!
2221 2018-12-31 05:54:27 Asian stocks rose on Monday as hints of progress on the Sino-U.S. trade standoff provided a rare glimmer of optimism in what has been a rough year-end for equities globally.

2232 2018-12-31 05:43:07 Top 19 for 2019: Stocks that could give double-digit returns in a year
                    Most experts now feel that India Inc. is on  track to register double-digit earnings growth in 2019. If the political  environment remains stable, we are on track to hit 40K on the Sensex.
2233 2018-12-31 05:42:14 It's not only in Bitcoin where a double bottom usually happens after such a drop but in traditional stocks as well. It might not happen until February but we we see 3k again before the next bull run
2234 2018-12-31 05:41:30 If You want to invest in small cap stock but fearing that what to buy.

Then i have a good suggestion
Just buy maruti and Tata group small cap stocks for at least 5 years. 

You portfolio will do better than anyone

2255 2018-12-31 05:25:20 I'd probably die of a heart attack. If I didn't, then I'd give 1/2 to my parents, use 250k as charity money, and use the other 250k to pay for college and an apartment. Whatever is left after all that goes into an account to collect interest or into stocks. Yeah I'm boring.

2330 2018-12-31 04:19:32 Probably because there are so many of them. Even the stocks that have good fundamentals seem to get ruined by poor management. I guess that's the way it is in the spec end. A red light I look out for is pumping on forums etc. and rapid price appreciation for no real reason.

2463 2018-12-31 02:19:36 I really don't want to say specifics other than obviously XRP, lol, but I hold a little of the top 20. I view them all as high risk, but top 20 Low, Top 100 medium, after that high. So I have a little in each category, like I would in stocks.

2469 2018-12-31 02:13:20 $NTAP imo, this is one of the best stocks to start buying at these levels. Solid growth outlook ahead and nice dividend.

2480 2018-12-31 02:04:23 Do you invest in individual stocks or do you rely on dividends from index funds?
2481 2018-12-31 02:03:51 A tip, if you want to talk about stocks, be the not that political. The more political you are, the less likely someone will follow you and listen to you. Stocks should be about making dat monnney. Not to be political.
2482 2018-12-31 02:03:26 Turning on Pokeballs and AT then doing Elite Smash is the most fun/hilarious thing I’ve doneit appears that we’re just playing a normal Match since it’s still 3 stocks/7 Min./BF then within moments and a few Pokéballs/AT I’ve gained complete stage control and roll them over 
2483 2018-12-31 02:03:04 I would guess that most #RothIRA investors dollar cost average and just set a monthly amount aside. With some stocks like $XOM and $PM still a great value right now, I’m considering front loading a bit to kick off 2019. If you have a thought, I’d love to hear it! #retirement
2484 2018-12-31 02:02:17 $isol I have been doing wicked swing trades last 6 weeks on good size postions. I am not much of a trader but a investor . BUT have been nailing that stock almost flawless.

2490 2018-12-31 01:53:56 Do you teach pennies stocks like sykes?
2491 2018-12-31 01:53:09 Ahh the ever famous “assault weapons” which no libtard can seem to define, and @POTUS is the one who asked for the ban on bump stocks. Background checks-fine. No gun registry, no ban on assault weapons, and no change in age. You made them snowflakes now deal with them owning guns
2492 2018-12-31 01:52:28 Common sense gun reform. Not allowing bump stocks or military grade weapons to those not in the military  In case you didn't know, that's common sense, Colin.
2493 2018-12-31 01:52:03 Assets put money in your pockets, liabilities take money out from your pockets.

Aquire Assets : stocks and bond, your own company, intelectual property.

Avoid Liabilities : mortage, consumer loans, credit cards.

I've reads your blogs, watched your videos on YouTube and yes your webinars too, all helped me to learn something new and I'm fortunate I've come across to know you. Although everything's fine but i find it lill difficult to filter stocks.
2502 2018-12-31 01:36:53 Tried something similar, ending it on and off stage Ko punch. Landed it with red flash but it didn't seal stock lol. Won with 6 stocks left. Fun.
2503 2018-12-31 01:34:59 Because they never deploy the stocks in their E11 blasters.
2504 2018-12-31 01:34:12 Banning pistol grips, muzzle brakes, compensators, and adjustable stocks - with are purely cosmetic/ergonomic - to keep people "safe" from gun violence makes as much sense as banning funny accents to prevent hate speech. The #SAFEAct is BS.

2507 2018-12-31 01:33:21 You can’t use book value to find a floor for financial stocks. They have computers and people and bank accounts. Computers are obsolete in six months. People can walk across the street join or create other businesses.  Customers close their accounts if they lose confidence $aig

Please kill yourself.

2529 2018-12-31 01:15:11 Best investment strategy is Averaging Down (AD).

AD is the process of consistently buying stock in certain company, even when stock is doing poorly. This allows you to reduce average cost per share and is very effective in long term.

2542 2018-12-31 01:06:39 You should get out of the speculative market and park your money into bank stocks if your so concerned about bullshit innuendos, suppositions and rumors designed to profit a short seller.  This is not a court of law and nothing illegal was done. A willing buyer bought something..
2543 2018-12-31 00:59:45 Buying land and having a new house built there, andcompletely paid off. Buying 2 cars for me and my wife. Everything else is going into stocks so that it can double or completely go away lol. I only have 24 hours, so may as well test my luck

2545 2018-12-31 00:59:09 Investors could see one last boost to Wall Street stocks in the final trading session of the year on Monday, but they do not expect gains to offset losses in the worst December since the 1930s.
2546 2018-12-31 00:57:33 #Birdbox is about to somehow make blind folds a trend in 2019. Buy your stocks wisely

2548 2018-12-31 00:56:51 Banning bump stocks isn’t going to stop crime.
2549 2018-12-31 00:56:36 12/26/2018 stock rally was weird but not really surprised me. It makes no sense but makes perfect sense. I believe that big institutions were behind the rally to lift stocks, so called pump and dump.
2550 2018-12-31 00:54:31 Pelosi, Schumer & others became millionaires under #44’s bank bailout. He gave them the name of banks he was bailing out ahead of time. They sold their under performing stocks & bought soon-to-be bailed out banks stock for pennies on the $. They made $$! M. Stewart was jailed!

2558 2018-12-31 00:48:39 Home builder stocks often rise at the end of the year and into the new year based on the "hope" trade. But we will also hear from Lennar and KB Home in the next 2 weeks. Will still have "hope" on spring sales until early spring probably.
2559 2018-12-31 00:47:42 One thing that helped me tremendously my first year trading stocks is that I didn't sell only because my stock went lower. Instead I asked myself the question "If I bought where I wish I had, would I be selling?" If the answer was an immediate no, I held.
2560 2018-12-31 00:47:27 Also I bought the stocks when they were dirt cheap bcs I wasn’t willing to spend anymore on something I didn’t know how to work but now they’re worth hundreds, I don’t know how to navigate the market or anything

2563 2018-12-31 00:46:19 Stocks will probably be moving sideways for a few months. Afterwards, the slide continues. In the meantime, enjoy the NFL playoffs. Stock up on popcorn and get ready for the 2019 ride.

2566 2018-12-31 00:45:42 TRUMP has caused Americans to loss in trade, jobs, stocks, retirement and our overall outlook.  I FEAR what is yet to come from pulling out of Syria and Afghanistan, not to mention we may never get back in on what we have lost.  TRUMP is the anti American.
2567 2018-12-31 00:45:28 I'm having fun don't get me wrong but getting hit just gets me tilted more in Ultimate than Smash 4 since you can just press more buttons than your stocks gone.
2568 2018-12-31 00:45:03 That’s what I’m trying to figure out, ever since I saw my balance shoot up when the stock market went up I’ve been trying to figure out how to work stocks but it’s so complicated, I want to try and engage and possibly make more but idk if It’s better to just leave it alone ??

2575 2018-12-31 00:39:09 IMHO, US stocks will break before the dollar does.  Treasuries will soar (briefly, then are likely to reverse on US funding concerns).  Then the Fed reversal, then we can get back to buying equities on leverage (haha)!
2576 2018-12-31 00:38:15 Teen Greta is exactly what her generation & Mother Earth need.

We do not own this planet, we r but temporary occupants.
2577 2018-12-31 00:37:59 Loser.  Holding the country hostage to get your way is a pathetic act.   Stocks are the worst since the great depression.  Keep up the good work.   This your idea of great?

2586 2018-12-31 00:26:40 Rocawear stocks went up cause of that verse. Lol.
2587 2018-12-31 00:26:36 IMO That’s what I believe. Gold has held up very well for being in a strong dollar/tightening environment. 

But for it to surpass $1500 I think it needs a easing Fed.

That’s why I’m loaded up on 1-1.5 year OotM call options for gold mining stocks.
2588 2018-12-31 00:25:37 Do bump stocks next! Bet those aren't being turned in either.
2589 2018-12-31 00:24:24 In younger years, I worked in dealerships and the sound of engines was always background noise. Next door neighbors... 2 of them... had  super-mods. Very used to hearing them fired up. Just a normal sound in my life. Still love it! Stocks, drags, whatever!

Pulled that 15 percent magic again.

#eagles fans owe him.

Also, can this be applied to stocks?
2591 2018-12-31 00:23:29 When this happens to you 2 stocks in a row in bracket you kinda start to rethink your entire life

2593 2018-12-31 00:20:19 #trade Asia stocks cheer Sino-U.S. trade talk, still see red for the year

U.S. President Donald Trump said he held a "very good call" with China's President Xi Jinping on Saturday to discuss trade and claimed "big progress" was being made. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Paci…

2595 2018-12-31 00:18:42 @Gap, keep playing stupid, dumb, or whatever the fuk you want to call it. I'm one man who have went against all your lying lawyers, and even the ones who was supposed to be representing me, you got to them so they sold me out. I'm going to see if your stocks can sell and crash.
2596 2018-12-31 00:17:54 DJ was at 19,827.....now at 23,062. Pretty good increase. You bought the wrong stocks evidently. Lol
2597 2018-12-31 00:16:59 La grande distribution a fait d'énormes stocks juste avant le passage à l'Euro et .....bingo

2599 2018-12-31 00:16:32 Not so much on the guns this year as accessories. Pelican cases, range finders, quality opticals, ammunition storage, and others (stocks, bipods, and lights/lasers).
2600 2018-12-31 00:14:27 Did Toyota and a few retail stores because I bought stocks right before the holiday season
2601 2018-12-31 00:14:21 3) However, as you can imagine, statistically over a longer time-frame stocks don't move huge amounts (especially in a few days) so you end up winning more of these... but be careful with selling calls on volatile stocks like $TSLA because that can burn you (experienced that too)
2602 2018-12-31 00:13:33 apple stocks rise by 10%.
2603 2018-12-31 00:12:13 Asian stocks crept higher on Monday as hints of progress on the Sino-U.S. trade standoff provided a rare glint of optimism in what has been a disappointing year for equities in the region.
2604 2018-12-31 00:12:11 But, but, but MSM #FakeNews said the call was BS. How come stocks are reacting to the same BS call?

You MSM are just full of it. The president calls it presidential harassment. He's right. It's indeed harrassment. You just want to harras him out of office.
2605 2018-12-31 00:10:59 Yes, I started hashtag #RealPeople for candidates to lead because these others (worried about their stocks and millions) are relatively ...clueless. Like the shutdown: they didn't understand that people live paycheck to paycheck. Where have they been???
2606 2018-12-31 00:09:55 I know its the internet and screens and whatever. But seriously in 2018 anyone who puts white font on a black background should be left out in stocks in like Saskatoon in the winter time.

Yes, I have lines burned into my vision now.

2609 2018-12-31 00:09:10 1) Oh, here's how the selling calls technique may backfire (otherwise it's a pretty safe method to generate recurring cash if you own the underlying stocks).

Let's say you own the stock and sell a call against it sufficiently above the current price (expiring this Friday).
2610 2018-12-31 00:04:40 I’m not trying to start an argument... personally I’ve lost more money investing in stocks & shares than I’d care to admit. I have / am putting in max I am happy to lose on an all or nothing punt and leave it until $500 or bust.... GLA
2611 2018-12-31 00:03:26 It would make my day year life.
2612 2018-12-31 00:03:26 are essentially proposition bets that do not require registration or accounting can stay in place. This is the real market. Stocks and bonds are a puppet show.
2613 2018-12-31 00:02:47 That’s just MAD - firstly, it’s still totally unethical to threaten civilians, secondly as you said we don’t have huge stocks of warheads compared to other nuclear powers, so getting rid of ours would have little effect on the overall total.
