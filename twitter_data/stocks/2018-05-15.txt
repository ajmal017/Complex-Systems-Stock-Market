36 2018-05-15 23:45:59 Commodities v equities still running the analogous pattern  to the previous tech bubble... and stocks not yet flashing 1987 danger v bonds. EMs not full crisis yet either. So copper (but watch the trendline), & oil for another ~10%. Maybe partial gold short against them.

40 2018-05-15 23:42:20 If you need stockpiles of machine guns and bump stocks to protect your family, you've got bigger problems. Maybe protecting your family might involve moving...?
41 2018-05-15 23:42:16 bc ‘Lejeune’ is French & the correct pronunciation is “Lejurn”
42 2018-05-15 23:42:00 Except more bullets can be shot in a rifle than a handgun. I’d say ban extended mags and bump stocks too while we’re at it. You’d be able to defend yourself with a handgun just the same as a rifle and less massacres would happen

47 2018-05-15 23:36:03 My portfolio manager invests a small portion in stocks and bonds, but majority 70+% of it is in the stock market with big companies like Boeing, Starbucks, Walmart, Amazon, etc...
It can get complicated 1, 2, 3, 5 year stock commitments, buying and selling.
48 2018-05-15 23:35:20 Oh well the primary purpose of my firearms is to protect my family. Also in the us we had 42k automotive related deaths. And only 32k gun deaths. Makes more argument to ban cars than bump stocks and rifles. All NFA items are banned

51 2018-05-15 23:33:48 @jimcramer If defensive stock dividends are no longer protecting them from the rising treasury yield, the stock price goes down. So how long before the rising stock yield DOES protect the stocks?
52 2018-05-15 23:32:10 Historically when #uranium has come back it's come back with a vengeance, says Chris Frostad of @PurepointU3O8; what's more, says Warren Stanyer of @ALXUranium, stocks tend to explode when prices rise #IMIC18

54 2018-05-15 23:31:43 Stocks will sell off temporarily. But as soon as the new money hits they will take off too. Pensions will benefit if they are adding to bitcoin and crypto. Let’s hope they see it this way. /2

56 2018-05-15 23:31:06 I'm doing the minimum required to get the company matching, and I also have stocks separate from that, as there's an employee rate on stocks. I just sort of dump cash in automatically and try to forget it exists.

59 2018-05-15 23:30:23 It means all the QE $ ended up in housing, stocks, and bonds as opposed to CPI. As the Fed unwinds its BS look for those asset prices to fall (ie. deflation) with the Fed's rxn being more QE, NIRP, helicopter $, and --> inflation.

62 2018-05-15 23:28:38 If that's what the proposals did that would be great. Bump stocks are stupid and wasted time.  But you can do the same thing with a shoe string or belt.
63 2018-05-15 23:28:27 There’s a huge void that a stable coins fill. I see it as a way to hedge against the market. They offer stability at the price of inflation. It’s the same reason having holdings in bonds/stocks/fiat is a good investment strategy. They won’t stop till there’s a clear winner.

77 2018-05-15 23:16:55 over the very log term and over many stocks

79 2018-05-15 23:14:31 Oh yes that would be brilliant. But since we are big in Henry 8th laws the stocks first. I'd travel with a lorry load of turnips sell them (at a handsome profit) to throw instead of tomatoes. Change the English £ to Scottish currency to discover I made a loss and still be happy
80 2018-05-15 23:13:39 My biggest disappointment is oil took off before the stocks did, w many up huge the last 1-2 mos, but clearly sentiment was washing out and should have reminded myself absence of selling can be as powerful as buying interest.  Combo of both recently.

84 2018-05-15 23:10:37 confused. Feds say they are already going to ban bump stocks and the company has closed down.

86 2018-05-15 23:09:52 They are undervalued right now TREFIS that monitors stocks says it should be worth around $17.23 a share. It closed at $10.65 today.. I think it may shoot back up to $20. If it does I’ll sell then. I’ll give it a couple of months to a year.
87 2018-05-15 23:08:54 Remember seeing your call... " easy double from here " what did you enter if you don't mind me asking. Up 50 percent atleast?

90 2018-05-15 23:04:16 Mm, I do like bonds. And stocks!
91 2018-05-15 23:04:06 some forex pairs and commodities, main indexes and crypto.. this just popped up on twitter so I checked out the chart, don't trade stocks.
92 2018-05-15 23:03:34 If a fund manager said that instead of actively selecting stocks, he/she would simply buy 3 or 4 ETFs producing similar performance, would anyone invest? Probably not, and hence the fund would not be on the largest YTD inflow list.
93 2018-05-15 23:02:35 Your bitcoin article (8 reasons why Bitcoin could drop another 50%) is so BS that you could have been just as informative as saying ‘8 reasons why BTC could increase 50%’. Stick to bonds and stocks mate!  This market isn’t for you.

135 2018-05-15 22:29:04 I'm assuming they don't mean Liquid, but a combination of all your investments is not that unrealistic. Between a 401k, rental properties, stocks, etc being worth 250k plus at 35 is not crazy

Bump stocks fascilitate a firing technique that can be done with practice. You don't need one to use the technique.

Bump stock ban does nothing.
140 2018-05-15 22:26:14 The other thing that we have to acknowledge is that the city can not pass an actual progressive tax either a graduated income tax or a tax on stocks/investments. So, the city had to do something and this gutted payroll fee is a pretty good start.

142 2018-05-15 22:24:38 Noko will be noko. Stocks are up substantially since Trump took office. Gas prices are up but at least not the 5 bucks a gallon I was paying under Obama.

143 2018-05-15 22:22:04 Did Mr trump ever have stocks with ZTE
144 2018-05-15 22:19:34 They do lol. But that typically what the SEC does too with big board stocks. They don’t care, halt, or suspend a P&D stock till its running big and they know it shouldn’t be.

146 2018-05-15 22:16:53 And don’t forget what andy wants! Andy boy #scheerstupidity didn’t just say but actually attempted to screw over Canadians a month ago.

147 2018-05-15 22:15:55 I was on other stocks which had fillings only to get a CE sign later. No fillings in years or much news even, what a coincidence to put a CE sign on it now while running. I am not in this ticker, just want to point out they love to do this shit.

149 2018-05-15 22:14:14 If the objective is to determine strategy/manager skill v. luck, even the most thought-out benchmarking scheme using cash/bonds/stocks won't be more telling than performance v. a passive replicating portfolio. Using both methods may bridge the average consumer's cognitive gap.

172 2018-05-15 21:55:18 Too much hype for gambling stocks related to now legalize gambling online. Great number of competition, unknown sales tax and regulation. Future revenue over estimated.
173 2018-05-15 21:51:00 Very interesting, there is only one mention of interest rates in this article! Low interest rates are the culprit for this behavior. MOney has been on sale for last ~10 years and this is the result! 

When money is expensive, stocks become cheap, just wait!

175 2018-05-15 21:50:29 Marketing money before infrastructure? Besides stocks, 401k, theoretical money etc? Tangibal items, difficult to put value on some things?
176 2018-05-15 21:49:17 Bullshit. At 35 you can have even bigger debts if you invest them right, so when you are retired the debts are gone and you have a home and some property (appartements, a company, stocks etc.) 
177 2018-05-15 21:48:17 A senior airline pilot and I went to the FCA a couple of years ago with a detailed report on what was going on, and a proposition for how to deal with in accordance with air industry safety standards.  But they didn't want to know.
178 2018-05-15 21:47:49 I completely agree. A law that could be made up over night. Will easily put us one step closer to govt. gun “control.” Bump stocks are not a threat to public safety. Peoples decisions are the source of all crimes.

185 2018-05-15 21:41:20 The man who killed 59 in Vegas legally bought all of his 71 guns. If there had been red flag laws or registration for his guns, if bump stocks were illegal, if his guns had to be registered so cops would've known he was stockpiling guns, those 59 people would still be alive.
186 2018-05-15 21:41:16 Managed stocks, bonds, etc , yet apparently NEVER had any type of securities license, per FINRA broker check
187 2018-05-15 21:40:00 Hirsch said he expects all assets - from real estate to metals, commodities, stocks, intellectual property, and brand equity - will be tokenized over the next decade in a way that lends greater liquidity to those markets through exchanges.
188 2018-05-15 21:39:54 Having sat through many panels of retirement and pension experts talking about what people should be doing I can confirm they have no idea what is happening to anyone under 55. I remember my parents had ‘stocks and shares’. Hilarious!!

225 2018-05-15 21:20:45 PTS has always been the kite standard for me where DB transfer advice is concerned. It's not now. No offence to all the exceptional PTS reading this that do actually do a great job. Why didnt I know this 3 years ago?!

237 2018-05-15 21:15:37 I’ve thought of some reasons why not CF30 but still possibly qualified or presumably previous PTS. Explains FCA desire to shut down outsourcing of sign off - I’ve never understood that one anyway.
238 2018-05-15 21:14:34 yeah, I recently left my bank 4 a local credit union. one of the first questions I asked is: how do you make your money? he said: car/home loans, they have a credit card. I said: what about investments: oil/stocks, he said: no, none of that. I said good, lets do this.
239 2018-05-15 21:14:17 I am far from impressed by tonight's revelation! No wonder there's so much crappy advice being bandied around

242 2018-05-15 21:11:37 The register as far as I know only shows the firms with permissions not those within firm who are/aren’t fulfilling PTS role so all relies on firm processes and controls re advisers

248 2018-05-15 21:08:51 I have traded fx and stocks for around 5 years, but for next 2-5 years will not even think about crypto trading. Fluctuations are too crazy, sentiment means much more the technical analysis, no need for trading if you buy the dip. #HODL
249 2018-05-15 21:08:51 yeah bump stocks are totally the problem. NOT!
250 2018-05-15 21:08:38 I can give you reading recommendations for some real stocks if you'd like that can show you how to trade for companies with actual value instead of this MGTI garbage?
251 2018-05-15 21:08:16 It worked with me tbh, I thought specialist meant exactly that. I know some are, I'm not suggesting that there aren't any PTS out there not qualified .... but the fact that this is even a thing, is very surprising.
252 2018-05-15 21:08:01 I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!

254 2018-05-15 21:06:32 So when I'm speaking with scheme members & checking the FCA register to see if an adviser is authorised to give financial advice re: pension transfers, it could be that he/she is authorised but not necessarily qualified? I'm really shocked by this tbh.
255 2018-05-15 21:05:43 All too often the word "specialist" with financial advisers has been what they chose to focus on selling e.g. SIPPs.

280 2018-05-15 20:58:47 Oh yes
281 2018-05-15 20:58:45 That’s actually incorrect.  Virtually every study ever done has demonstrated that the “skill” of picking stocks largely does not exist
282 2018-05-15 20:58:43 Facts. Best investment you can make is in yourself. Reading books, listening to audios on how to invest in real estate, stocks, business etc.
283 2018-05-15 20:57:24 Surely we've all had those yearnings to hack into corporate systems, divert profits to good causes, send 'you're fired' letters to executives, have their stocks sold for tuppence... yes, I *am* thinking about the arms trade, actually..
284 2018-05-15 20:56:43 See David this is something I can support and the @NRA even supports banning Bump Stocks. Yet we do not agree with Banning a Gun! Do you understand? #guns #bumpstocks #nra

300 2018-05-15 20:47:43 I find the, "But Amazon is up 100x since the dot com bubble" justification for today's overvalued tech stocks and ICOs amusing.

What's the expected return of a sample set where 1 out of every 1,000 get a 100x return and the rest lose 80%?

318 2018-05-15 20:38:42 I think new rules looking to resolve this but odd to say the least that in theory someone who is unqualified signs off advice by someone who is qualified. 

Flies in the face of the future requirement for DB advice to be more based on bigger picture stuff than simply the DB.
319 2018-05-15 20:37:40 Thanks so I guess the 30bps outperformance could be due to sector differences, those stocks becoming more expensive or any number of unrelated variables .it doesn't necessarily make the case for esg outperforming .

337 2018-05-15 20:25:39 Just when I thought stocks might summon up enough to break out upward, it bounces off the top of the sideways range and heads lower again. TREND REMAIN DOWN, HALF HEDGES in place. Using the down to look for opportunities and enjoying the ride!
338 2018-05-15 20:25:34 World stocks mostly lower: US -.7%; Europe +.05%. A combination of profit taking, rising interest-rates & slower European growth weighed on markets. Might be prudent to avoid new commitments to interest-rate sensitive stocks like Utilities & REITs until rates steady.

341 2018-05-15 20:24:45 There are laws that keep guns out of hands of people that can not possess them. Assault weapons, there is no such thing like saying assault vehicles, assault spoons. Its a made up word. Bump stocks FBI stated themselves they do not convert them in to fully auto.
342 2018-05-15 20:24:23 The same retail investors who get rekt by penny stocks, pink sheets, gambling, lotto, etc. why treat crypto differently than any of those? At least in crypto they will have a chance to learn something valuable because while there’s a lot of shit, there is quality in the space
343 2018-05-15 20:23:57 Not to defend or nothing, but this is a very misleading headline. It is like saying AI capable phone buys 2 stocks instead of one but it is unknown if it was being used at the time. Like, whaaaa. Stop just grabbing the easy headline to build a narrative.
344 2018-05-15 20:23:32 I think it was one of those things I sort of knew but it was still a shock that you didn’t need Lvl 4 or any investment quals
345 2018-05-15 20:23:18 Wow! You are normalizing a president manipulating company stocks and promoting a specific business. It is unethical at best.  specially since he does it to benefit himself, his friends, and big donors or to punish those he is jealous or angry at. He behaves like an authoritarian.

358 2018-05-15 20:15:24 Benchmarking is hard in the sense that it's never perfect. Broadly speaking, the S&P 500 is pretty close to the KLD 400 in US stocks capitalization. Regarding sector differences, I have no idea. This is why benchmarking is hard. Later dudes, moving on to other conversations! :)

375 2018-05-15 20:02:44 Bump stocks have no place in civil society. Take your NRA talking points AND your bump stocks to Siberia...I'm sure some oligarch or another will vouch for you.
376 2018-05-15 20:02:04 The benchmark could simply match the "duty cycle" of strategy over a long period, i.e. if overall stocks were held 60% of total time and cash 40% of total time, then benchmark would be static 60/40.
377 2018-05-15 20:02:02 It means you get the same yield no matter whether you hold S&P 500 stocks or 3mo US government bonds, so stocks look a bit expensive.
378 2018-05-15 20:00:14 Perhaps if the Trump nominees were not so objectionable—with the exception of a few, most are either incompetent or destructive.   Many have serious conflicts of interest and stand to enrich themselves in their position via stocks, policy changes etc.
379 2018-05-15 20:00:07 I agree that guns are not the problem. It’s because of the killers for sure. They are the reason that bump stocks shouldn’t be available. And other sensible precautions.

390 2018-05-15 19:54:10 Andy boy #scheerstupidity didn’t just say but actually attempted to screw over Canadians a month ago. Your pension and mutual funds are buying pot stocks. Andy Capp tried to stop that. Billions invested thousands of jobs.  #Andysnothereforyouorme #scheerjustwantstobePM

393 2018-05-15 19:53:08 I have been promoting BC wines here in the uk for the past 32 years! I bring back and give BC wines as presents to my uk friends. There’s simply not enough of it on sale for general availability here in the uk. Love that it’s being promoted but who stocks it and where?
394 2018-05-15 19:52:33 Whatever one’s opinion is on the direction of rates, I think the reason a country’s rates are going up is more relevant than that they are going up. From 2009 to 2011 the Greek 10 Year went from 5.7% to 35% . Greek stocks fell 79% in that stretch and have never recovered.
395 2018-05-15 19:52:31 It's always the stocks you don't buy enough of that rip.  $APH is my smallest holding and my biggest % gain this week.  #TheWayItGoes

399 2018-05-15 19:50:43 Remember that a successful trade is any trade in which you followed your rules. We don't like to be down on our unrealized P/L, but reality is that prices fluctuate.  2day is just as uncertain as it was yesterday, but if you look back, you can that you got through that.

410 2018-05-15 19:47:57 That’s true unless you watch your numbers! Stocks go up & down when they are down that’s the best time to invest, especially in a company that you know toggles back & forth (i.e. Tesla)

I don't owe my opponents anything, and if it keeps me sane, I'll gladly forfeit to avoid salt.
419 2018-05-15 19:43:43 This should be a no brainier.  Automatic weapons are banned.  Bump stocks modify riffles to perform as automatic What's the deal? They owe to lobbist and would like more.  They see any gun law as bad for their bottom line/electability.  Vote!

427 2018-05-15 19:40:08 We banned automatic weapons for a reason.  Bump stocks need to be banned for the same reason.  It allows one demented person to eliminate so many, so quickly.

436 2018-05-15 19:35:42 The correlation between stocks and the yield curve hasn’t been this negative since October 2008.  Which one is right?

441 2018-05-15 19:32:36 During 2016 campaign Trump promised to use govt’s power, including Medicare’s role in paying for prescription drugs, to bring drug prices down. None of that was in his Friday speech. If he's really getting tough on drug companies, why did his speech send drug stocks soaring?
442 2018-05-15 19:32:36 Just LOOK AT THE DOW DROPPING, faster than Trump's drawers on a Russian Hooker pee fest outing! Woohoo, TRUMPERS, I really hope your employers invested your retirement $ in stocks! I know a FEW Trump supporters who will be losing "bigly"

451 2018-05-15 19:26:11 Of course Interest rates will be rising but not until 3.20+ do we expect competition.  Gold stocks are outperforming gold and hence at least a trading buy today/tonight or tomorrow AM.

457 2018-05-15 19:23:23 This would be a good way for credit unions to differentiate themselves from the big banks: offer #Green #LocalBusiness and #Peace oriented retirement portfolios (no Dow, Monsanto, Koch industries, etc. stocks). #GunReformNow #GrabYourWallet
458 2018-05-15 19:22:46 First off, "getting tough" on people who save lives is kind of silly. Second, Krugman knows stocks aren't about whether Trump is getting tough but how much uncertainty was removed by the speech. Trump could get plenty "tough" as long as it wasn't as tough as he might have.

But if 99% "just buy the index" those are going to be some huge outperformances for the 1% picking individual stocks.

522 2018-05-15 18:45:10 The oligarch's probably have the entire staff in stocks for their transgression and for daring to think they can print anything without oligarchic approval
523 2018-05-15 18:44:22 When an author is like, "I would prefer you use sustainably produced paper, and would be willing to subsidize the cost of printing" and I get to say, "We already use FSC chain-of-custody certified stocks, so no worries!"
524 2018-05-15 18:43:56 Do you really know what a military rifle is? Remington 700 SPS is a small game rifle? Did you also know that the M24 sniper rifle is the same thing? Both have wood stocks. The Remington 700 is civilian and M24 is military, but still the same weapon. Your point is invalid.
525 2018-05-15 18:43:46 Try and combine stocks and change the hue on some of them, it looks too repetitive. Sorry if I seemed rude, just some constructive criticism
526 2018-05-15 18:41:51 I need to do more research on etf’s. I just find stocks and watch them. Listen to a few conf calls when they do their qtr releases and then buy
527 2018-05-15 18:40:46 WTF? Financial advise? Solicitations for other strategy? What is #usatoday trying to accomplish here? Leave more stocks out in the open for large purchase opportunities, which WILL end up being held; what is your goal? Leave investing to lic. advisors.
528 2018-05-15 18:40:17 Yes, Democrats are now talking about how bad President Trump’s Idea of lowering cost of prescription drugs, the Stock Mark went up right after he amounted the cut!   Sure Stocks went up for the last big deal before the cut takes affect...How childish, selfish, & evil can they be?

535 2018-05-15 18:36:42 I'll feel better about stocks as more than a trade once the market is pricing in 3-4 hikes in 2019 rather than 1.5.
536 2018-05-15 18:36:39 Hey all knowing @KyleKashuv. 
 You just tweeted out a proposal of rule change as absolute fact that bump stocks have been banned. This NPRM will not be made final until 6-27-18, and it may still be rewritten.
  There is no ban. Just your immaturity and ignorance of the facts.

560 2018-05-15 18:22:26 'best tools' is wrong Q. 'Best' way to restore stocks is to combine effective regulations (coupled with blend of expert & local knowledge); appropriate levels of local participation; appropriate economic incentives, including allocation of rights + effective awareness raising
561 2018-05-15 18:21:42 I don't know, the S&P 500 dividend yield was lower than the 3-month T-bill for the entire stretch from 1995 to 2000 as stocks tripled, and again from '05-'07 as stocks rose. I might want to check a few other signals before fleeing to Treasury paper.

569 2018-05-15 18:16:03 IMHO, we NEED a strong close on the indexes! Today will either be a constructive shakeout/retest of the 4/18 key pivot or potential failure. Bulls need to close strong today if they want it. Buy the dippers, here's your chance! RDR's also setting up on key stocks: $AAPL  :)

571 2018-05-15 18:14:03 Ok for stocks or anything you can actually derive an intrinsic value, but for FX/Commodities/Rates they are pretty useful tools.

600 2018-05-15 18:00:31 What? 90% of portfolios for people who are retired are composed of dividend yielding stocks
601 2018-05-15 17:59:20 today, yes. But 1BCH was arbitrarily chosen to represent 100,000,000 satoshis, and if industry agrees to change the ticker to mean 100 satoshis instead, I see that as a good thing for new users.

makes BCH act and feel more like currency, and less like stocks.
602 2018-05-15 17:59:17 I dont recall saying anything about substituting sports wagering in place of stock market investing in lieu of retirement.  We are discussing the skillful aspects of partaking in both genres...or rather, making educated bets on games is a skillful endeavor for some, like stocks
603 2018-05-15 17:59:16 And I guess the 58 dead and 800 wounded in Las Vegas was a small price to pay so that others can purchase bump stocks and play soldier boy.

628 2018-05-15 17:41:32 Bump stocks DO NOT "convert" a semi-auto to a "machine gun" and just saying they do, doesn't make it so.

If Congress wants to make a law banning them, whatever. At least that is more genuine than ATF changing the definition of an accessory in order to magically implement a ban.

662 2018-05-15 17:25:00 As a reminder, we use a 3.5% 10-year yield in our stock market model.  It still says stocks are undervalued by 10%, using Q4 earnings.  And earnings should grow 20% in 2018.
663 2018-05-15 17:24:45 Pokémon Company usually reveals games in the month of May, the first info. May is the first month of the fiscal year, this helps about the company's relevance and stocks, so it makes sense. Besides being before E3, where people expect to have something
664 2018-05-15 17:24:32 There’s no reason for bump stocks.  Support ban
665 2018-05-15 17:24:02 Tonnage is fine but we'll have to find ways to get people to pay for the work (not just pay people to sit on 'stocks of carbon, which some want). I only care about the conservation work being done and the reality is that we have to find more ways to pay for it 1/2
666 2018-05-15 17:23:47 Good to know. One more name to the list of stocks to be analysed.
667 2018-05-15 17:23:45 Anyone have any recommendations for resources on where I can learn more about investing (for beginners)? Stocks/Mutual funds sort of stuff?

673 2018-05-15 17:20:31 Janet is a kitsune who trades stocks as a hobby.
674 2018-05-15 17:20:08 .@LaMonicaBuzz did you do any stories of what stocks might get a bump with the news and on sports gambling yesterday?
675 2018-05-15 17:20:04 @peanut_brigade where do you see junior mining stocks on TSX Venture going in 2018?
676 2018-05-15 17:20:02 Yes.
It is unknown.

So, there is the potential that UK catch could increase after the transition period, providing stocks can cope.


677 2018-05-15 17:19:39 U.S. stocks slipped after the latest #retail #Sales data indicated rising #inflation and pushed up Treasury #yields, while #Trade worries lingered with no signs of progress in U.S.-China talks.
#EURUSD has corrected toward the 50% of the days trading range at the 1.18788.
678 2018-05-15 17:19:26 And in 2007/2008, the yield curve inverted before the start of the stock market slide. Having said that, I think we can all agree, that both times, trouble in the stocks was within (before/after) a year of the inversion
679 2018-05-15 17:18:55 SGX Nifty : 10776.00 down by -49.50 points (-0.46%)
680 2018-05-15 17:18:15 its 3.08%. This is not funny anymore. They have to do something otherwise Fang stocks (and many others) may collapse.
681 2018-05-15 17:17:36 No one said you had to care about bump stocks, but in a free country that honors the 2A we don’t ban them.  I couldn’t support that.  Squiggs is right,  that’s leftist cuckery no matter who it is.
682 2018-05-15 17:15:58 Didn’t imply Ramaphosa per se but the positive “narrative” about the euphoria when he was elected as such... the counter narrative is now negative you see (as you allude to) so same stocks reverse for different reasons

687 2018-05-15 17:13:50 Peak not far away imo, renewed weakness will help catapult stocks to ATHs this summer imho, then the crash should see the C wave of this ABC rally in the dollar take hold before it collapses in 2019 imho.
688 2018-05-15 17:12:39 No.  May I ask what chart package you use or one you recommend for stocks - I just found out the IG ones I have been using cannot be fully trusted..
689 2018-05-15 17:11:33 1/
TAC (Total Allowable Catch) ?

That is to conserve fish stocks isn't it.

I don't know.
Guessing that...

The fish will be over fished if there is not a TAC.
EU want to protect the fish stocks & EU owned boats.
Env. legislation is part of the transition & final agreement.

714 2018-05-15 17:02:53 It depends on what the rest of the portfolio is invested in and how those asset classes performed. There's nothing new or magical about the investment strategies used by robo advisers. It's all stocks and bonds, all the same markets, and all the same risks.

716 2018-05-15 17:02:30 Goos was the only one on the list I saw as a buy crossing the trigger on high volume. Down days like today you are only monitoring stocks you own to sell if necessary and limit losses?
717 2018-05-15 17:01:54 Well the bond market is selling off like crazy. But it's not having much effect on stocks, and if I had to guess, it's because the cash moved into them from cryptos. But this news about amazon using blockchain could be bullish for cryptos, especially ethereum.
718 2018-05-15 17:01:23 I am definitely better off schmuck, and I’d venture to say that all productive Americans are better off. Business are better off, stocks are better off, the unemployment rates are better off etc. Now ISIS is not better off and the dem party isn’t either but who cares!!

729 2018-05-15 16:57:16 U.S.Stocks fell as investors worried about a lack of progress in U.S.-China trade talks and Treasury yields rose after U.S. retail sales data indicated rising inflation.
730 2018-05-15 16:56:39 How can you be one of the faces of a movement and not be able to look this up and see that it has already happened. This is just bad. Trump and the attorney general have already addressed this and made bump stocks fall under the label of machine gun. They are banned

735 2018-05-15 16:51:14 Banning bump stocks won’t save many lives, because they don’t take many lives. They are mostly a novelty and actually hinder accuracy. Most gun deaths are at the hands of handguns. These bans have nothing to do with saving lives, nothing.

754 2018-05-15 16:40:37 Yeah Chris. Back in the day the throw weight of bonds was much larger than equities; a tiny move in fixed income rates caused havoc in stocks. Today, equity volatility is a self-perpetuating Brownian Motion machine. It wiggles and jiggles like a pole dancer in an “easy” room.

780 2018-05-15 16:33:09 the biggest reason is that the idea of 0.01 spreads or less in stocks is a fiction if you have any kind of size to move. Liquidity is so fleeting, and thus risk management is very challenging for moving in and out of positions
781 2018-05-15 16:32:51 Debt boosts asset prices. That’s why stocks and real estate perform so well during periods of QE. But when financing costs rise and buyers run short on cash, asset price will inevitably fall.
782 2018-05-15 16:31:29 The issue is that your performance as a PM does not support such staunch proclamations.  That makes you appear so.  The best small value managers live in places like Boise and are unassuming.  Just like the stocks we buy.  #liveit

785 2018-05-15 16:29:31 I would never buy a crypto with so much bad energy like Populous, Theta or Eos. Some people don't care, if they are part of something so evil, but to me it matters. It is like you would buy Clinton foundation stocks when you know this is a bribary machine and the energy is dark.

787 2018-05-15 16:29:01 Which has resulted in Global Overpopulation:- More people - More pollution=climate change+acid oceans , Soil degradation+fresh water shortages=future famines, depleted fish stocks thru overfishing etc. etc.etc.
788 2018-05-15 16:28:46 I'd start with global market capitalization, which means half in U.S. stocks and half abroad. You might adjust from there, depending on how much currency exposure you can handle--but remember that probably all of your bonds involve no currency risk.
789 2018-05-15 16:28:08 It's a judicial nightmare for the past 25 years bump stocks have been selling unregulated and there's between 5million and 100million with no registration no trace. You make them illegal and we have what happened to the tec9 with millions flooding the streets because of demand

802 2018-05-15 16:21:45 There’s a lot of people in this thread claiming that bump stocks are “useless” or the old adage that “banning X means only criminals will have X.”
Both of those are poor arguments.
Bump stocks are not useless. Just because a law will be broken does not mean it shouldn’t be made.

826 2018-05-15 16:14:17 Stocks are what a statistician would call "not serially correlated." Which means when a stock is heading in a particular direction, the odds are 50/50 the stock continues in that direction or reverses course.

950 2018-05-15 15:08:58 The only reason for bumpstocks is killing as many people as possible in a short period of time. As here is NO need to kill many people in a short time, there is NO need for bump stocks.

959 2018-05-15 15:04:54 It is however significant. The AR-15 is nothing more than a dressed up .223 hunting rifle. I would give you bump stocks and high cap magazines though because I believe neither is needed by a hunter or competitive marksman. Oh AR= Armalite Rifle 15= design model #

1015 2018-05-15 14:41:00 The key thing is to donate stocks that you’d sell were it not for the capital gains tax. For example, if you have a stock that has outperformed the market, this gives you a tax free way to diversify. And you benefit from future portfolio gains in the DAF.
1016 2018-05-15 14:40:37 It now looks like they are going to attempt to prop up the bond market which will, in this environment, also push stocks up. Will it work?

1024 2018-05-15 14:37:28 It would recreate it on top of a much more generous standard deduction. Potentially that's a triple benefit for some folks. The standard deduction, the charitable deduction, and the lack of cap gains taxation.

I'm with you that acceleration isn't a big deal (if stocks grow).

(And if you are planning to donate a stock anyway, how much does it really matter when you avoid the tax on the gains?)

1298 2018-05-15 12:24:26 Key questions IMO when analyzing the potential for a broad run on spec stocks. How early in the story is it? How much potential does this story have to appreciate? How much money is yet to enter the sector it’s in? Spec stocks run on the “pump potential” of the story & sector.
1299 2018-05-15 12:23:30 Dave.. you should put your dedication into finding stocks you like rather than stocks you don't.

It can be quite profitable, I did 1300% ROI last year.

Give it a go.. it's quite enjoyable.

Me: If you were grown up enough to invest in stocks in 1929, you would have died by now OR would be of an age where that amount did not matter to you.

1324 2018-05-15 12:06:02 Actually a third party coming and buying stocks directly from shareholders (esop holders or otherwise), is a private deal. The company is not spending company money so not covered by companies law buyback. This isn’t a buy back per day, it is share sale. Private deal.

1334 2018-05-15 12:00:05 No it's not. This graph shows the combination of stock appreciation + dividend paid in your account. If you reinvest your dividend in both stocks, RY would outperform the Split Corp by a larger amount since RY shares grew by 100% during that period (+dividend).

1339 2018-05-15 11:56:03 As a general rule, The percentage of stocks you have in your portfolio should equal 100 minus your age. 

You’re probably good if you go with 100 minus how old you feel.

And probably offside with 100 minus how old you want to be

Thank you,

It’s a funny p/f because many stocks in it go against the grain, but can’t argue with results...

1442 2018-05-15 10:24:18 Short version: 
Pick stocks (whether through technical analysis or fundamental analysis, or a mix of both) if you can put in a lot of time to study investing and to watch the market. By a lot of time, hours and hours every week.

1545 2018-05-15 08:51:05 三菱UFJが18年3月期本決算を発表。増収増益で着地したが、経常利益と純利益は会社目標達成も市場予想に届かず。対市場予想97%以上の達成率は悪くないが、19年3月期の純利益目標が14.2%減の数字と過去5年間で最低（13年3月期水準）。組織再編・収益構造の本格改革を考慮すればこんなものか？#stocks

1550 2018-05-15 08:48:50 Self Note:

The best stocks bought are often those stocks which you already have owned and felt the pain with past results and management failures

Sometimes later comes the chance to buy those same stocks cheaper on RNS news days because you have the confidence ahead of others.
1551 2018-05-15 08:48:38 Will like to know more about stocks and crypto I have ideas about crypto, the ICOs, airdrop, token, HODL but don’t know how to trade or brokers that is trust worthy

1568 2018-05-15 08:37:12 Midcaps continue to crumble. I remain extremely risk averse. Have used the rally from March lows to sell several stocks. 

I am happy to maintain significant cash levels in times to come. 

Bothered more about interest rates, currency and valuations than politics or elections.
1569 2018-05-15 08:36:39 I agree with the message, but not the math. The reason people can profit is that they're - unknowingly - making a risky leveraged investment. Ask the bank if you can borrow to leverage 4-5x on stocks and witness their shock at how dangerous that is. "Buy a house? Great idea!"
1570 2018-05-15 08:35:04 Hi, currently only @PaintshackLtd stocks them, but soon you should be able to get them in-stores too. Hope it helps.

1579 2018-05-15 08:28:36 Hi Alex, there is no minimum term of investment in a Stocks & Shares ISA or General Investment Account with us. If you hold a Lifetime ISA, there is a 25% penalty charge for withdrawing funds for any purpose other than purchasing your first property or your retirement (1/2)
1580 2018-05-15 08:27:54 This just to remind....forget stocks which had undeserved run in 2017 new bull run will have new stocks
1581 2018-05-15 08:26:50 Hi Francisco, you can indeed withdraw the value of your investments if you have a Stocks & Shares ISA or a General Investment Account with us. For more information on exactly how to do this, please email the team on support@moneyboxapp.com or send us an in-app chat message

1596 2018-05-15 08:13:02 Stocks close slightly higher, trimming earlier gains
1597 2018-05-15 08:10:52 Treating vested stocks for current vs ex employees differently doesn't sound fair. One of the many reasons that faith in ESOPs is very low. They have all the right to demand equal treatment for stocks that have vested already.
1598 2018-05-15 08:10:39 The ONLY Sino-American trade policies that make sense to the U. S. are to (1) confiscate ALL the U.

1626 2018-05-15 07:40:07 It's using the model of Stocks & Flows but not realising that this model has another dimension, which is about Nurturing as well as Exploiting Stocks and Flows. And in current context, nature's Stocks & Flows have been so over-exploited, all we should do now is Nurture.
1627 2018-05-15 07:40:04 Having sat through many panels of retirement and pension experts talking about what people should be doing I can confirm they have no idea what is happening to anyone under 55. I remember my parents had ‘stocks and shares’. Hilarious!!

1773 2018-05-15 05:25:31 Stocks like DBL, Mindtree, Mphasis, DMart, HDFC, DHFL, GE Twins, and so many such stocks just went up 20-50% between feb & april. If you'd invested in index futures alone, you'd have made 950 points today. Goes without saying - market will do whatever the heck it wants to.
1774 2018-05-15 05:24:16 Exactly! One of the "experts" predicted 9500. Another guy i knew said he sees 9100 that everything should go to shit. Although Nifty hasn't gained much since 2011 on a CAGR basis, it's still the best bet for small investors. If one had invested in quality stocks in feb fall, (1)
1775 2018-05-15 05:22:42 TAMO, ACC don't care much about the bullish market, these stocks are in a downtrend which was quite visible on charts :)

1802 2018-05-15 04:59:27 Well those who are shorting should understand there are many stocks to buy they have corrected sharply in last few session and some have consolidates pretty well
1803 2018-05-15 04:59:23 Absolutely. FED easy money goes away, world "global growth" story turns into fears of recession, baby boomers start cashing in their stocks and bonds, feedback loop starts, etc. We still probably are a year-ish away tho.

1867 2018-05-15 03:52:47 What happens if your stocks and bond tokens are stolen? What about the logistics for dividends or coupon payments?

Blockchains require decentralization, PoW and consensus driven governance, huge burdens and probably impossible.
1868 2018-05-15 03:51:20 Money doesn't work like that. People want to use the same thing. Twitter stock will be priced in bitcoin. 

Stocks and bonds can be tokenized (not until they are willing to rebel against the system) but that doesn't require a blockchain. I'd actually say it's a very bad idea...

Will invest little in each..
1902 2018-05-15 03:17:17 No I just trade on technical analysis and I do not use alerts. I just go through a lot of charts and make watchlists. I use @StocksToTrade to scan for stocks.

1904 2018-05-15 03:14:33 I have 30 stocks in my portfolio. Will all stocks be discussed ?
1905 2018-05-15 03:13:31 Ignore this advice. It is designed to trick Americans to buy stocks. There are better ways.

1910 2018-05-15 03:10:58 @realDonaldTrump just was hoping for updates from you on Puerto Rico, bump stocks, Flint water, Melania’s recovery(wish her well), and was wondering if while campaigning and chanting how successful things are going you were thinking about that health care plan you were creating?
1911 2018-05-15 03:10:50 Entered melee today and it fucking sucked. Been feeling a lot better at the game then I lost in bracket to 2 stitchfaces that took 2 of my stocks each both games I was winning then I lost to a top seed who got upset r1 lol fuck my life
1912 2018-05-15 03:08:51 Investment report I recently received reviewed some stocks, recommended as buys, saying “Bad run can't last forever”. I think every company  that’s ever gone bankrupt would disagree! #asx #trading #investing
1913 2018-05-15 03:07:51 I actually agree on bump stocks. However every gun sold is semi-auto. So you think a pistol with a 15 round mag I can empty in 10 seconds and reload would be excessive too then huh? You see why we get worried? Gun control advocates will never say what they want. All guns gone.

1916 2018-05-15 03:00:48 Unable to comment on short term movements of the stock. Possible that it has been an overreaction to results. But I would bet the best days are over. Please refer my tweet dated 2nd Feb for my general opinion about the carbon stocks.

1921 2018-05-15 02:59:15 I had TLNUF at .0021 and sold same day at .005 lolol. Didn't touch again until last Friday at. 0259 and since then I've added .031 .037 .05 and .056 but my avg is still in the 3s. Haven't sold a share I am confident in this one. However, I may take some profits on the morning pop
1922 2018-05-15 02:58:22 guys. whoever wants to buy stocks under PSE- VUL in PH's stock market. DO DM ME.
1923 2018-05-15 02:55:57 Stocks are fucking hard
1924 2018-05-15 02:52:58 Same here hence no stocks on shelves on many occasions. I too applaud the decision to make it fair for all.  Just read or heard something along the line whether it was in aid to try & stop what was happening or still a money making scheme!  Cheers my friend.
1925 2018-05-15 02:52:53 aaaannnd ,,,  yes! .... up go the arms manufacturing stocks! I mean - there's no money in peace, right?
1926 2018-05-15 02:52:41 Certain IGA shops still stocks them.
1927 2018-05-15 02:52:26 So Clicks has been added to msci . This has become such a game. They know they can buy these stocks up  to ludicrous levels. All locals will short forcing a squeeze and then they can use index buying liquidity to get out. On the opposite side sibanye been cut
1928 2018-05-15 02:50:35 Yeah I got a good feel for it I've been watching since TLNUF. It's a damn unicorn that's for sure
1929 2018-05-15 02:50:21 Speaking of the Vegas massacre, where the shooter added bump stocks, it allowed him to fire 9 rounds per second. He didn’t need a permit, a background check or a waiting period to buy one. You can purchase bump stocks online for $90 to $200.
1930 2018-05-15 02:49:02 do you have any suggestions on how to look up the best pot stocks besides big percent gainers ?
1931 2018-05-15 02:48:32 I don't get why investors are allowed to short stocks, and then put out negative news to make a profit...
1932 2018-05-15 02:47:21 Special timing post: whatever move begins 5/15-16 could dominate markets through mid-June at least and possibly later. Prefer stocks to fade and begin multi week decline, but this timing cycle historically does more damage in existing downtrends ie currently bonds and $DXY
1933 2018-05-15 02:46:33 あーあ、こないだ売っちゃったんだよな。結果だけ見ると悔しい。
1934 2018-05-15 02:45:53 @BloombergQuint @_nirajshah Data representation of stocks on your website is amazing,but only problem is that it is not latest data. For ex. For AU Small Finance bank it shows that no any Mutual Fund invested where as actually in last quarter many mutual fund schemes bought.

1936 2018-05-15 02:45:26 Existing laws don’t allow cops to take guns from suspected mentally ill people. Existing laws don’t require a gun license, training, or storage in a safe manner. Existing laws don’t ban bump stocks or make 21 the minimum age.
1937 2018-05-15 02:44:53 Guess stockbrokers are getting richer while the rest of us wonder why we are dying from lack of drinking water. Stocks are based on speculative horoscopes generated by web bots, not president tweets
1938 2018-05-15 02:44:27 That's so damn crazy.... it just might work. Especially if every LP followed. If you have a good size portfolio of 30+ weed stocks, pledges along will keep you partying all month.  Boss level is 90 pledges for 90 Lps , non stop hodl party.

1944 2018-05-15 02:39:41 Oh I see. I was wondering if you use to size in on stocks or you just use technical analysis to trade. Great trades your making lately. You must use alerts. How do you find otc stocks?

1947 2018-05-15 02:36:30 Folding stocks and second grips don't make guns more dangerous, but I'm pretty sure "grenade launcher" already needs special lisencing.

1950 2018-05-15 02:33:01 See wizards has learned that good fetches wreck standard while good duals do not. Khans BFZ was arguably the worst standard because 4-5 color standard decks don’t have as much variation as there modern counterparts due to the smaller card pool. Therefore checks and stocks is good

1952 2018-05-15 02:30:40 Because there is no continuity in most of it from State to State. Gun Show sales don’t have to follow a lot of the rules for selling which differ between States. Bump stocks should have been banned immediately after the Vegas shooting. The fact that it’s even a debate is odd.
1953 2018-05-15 02:30:15 I had some cash in 2007 stupid rally but by Jul 2008 was fully invested. Then market went 40% down from there too. i Had 20-22 stocks rather than usual ten.

1970 2018-05-15 02:15:44 It is not. Which is why only a small group of people oppose banning bump stocks.
And banning bump stocks is sensible gun control. Banning the AR-15 not so much.
1971 2018-05-15 02:14:00 Yes, a balanced portfolio is king! Heavy in stocks when young, then gradually add bonds as you get older.
1972 2018-05-15 02:12:53 good thing trump proposes a ban on bump stocks then.

1980 2018-05-15 02:03:02 I'm not against gun rights, nitwit. Just assault weapons, bump stocks, large magazines. Plus I'm for universal background checks, no selling at gun shows, no selling to domestic abusers, no selling to mentally disturbed, etc.  But you just keep believing whatever you want.

1984 2018-05-15 02:00:00 The dollar doesn’t always dictate direction. Conventional wisdom tells us that a falling dollar is a must in order for int'l equities to outperform domestic stocks. Yet in 78% of the years since 1970 in which U.S. equities outpaced foreign stocks, the U.S. dollar was higher.
1985 2018-05-15 01:58:07 When measured against risk, only 3% or professional money managers can consistently beat the market. Anyone can beat the market with high growth stocks that typically come with a lot of additional volatility above the benchmark. S&P500 does the stock selection for you.
1986 2018-05-15 01:57:49 Nothing to see here. ALL of the cloud stocks sold off today for no reason. Look at NOW PPFT FSCT PANW NOW NEWR OKTA PSTG ZEN HUBS.  All cloud stocks, all in the red. Pure nonsense.
1987 2018-05-15 01:56:00 Is playing poker sinful? As a poker player I always have to explain that poker is a skill game, and not the same as playing any other game at a casino. It’s more akin to starting a small business, playing pro golf or trading stocks.
1988 2018-05-15 01:54:12 But regardless, AR-15s and assault rifles are very lethal and should either be handled with caution or not at all depending on the user.

It does your cause a disservice to limit your definition to AR-15's with bump stocks when there are so many more types.
1989 2018-05-15 01:52:58 They know they've made bank on lobbyist offers, will likely recieve salaries soon at various fossil feul energy, internet, pharmaceutical, weapons companies soon, or are retiring on the financial gains of policies that affected stocks they held. They are "in the big club".
1990 2018-05-15 01:50:56 I don't entirely disagree with your cause, but this reply is wrong on so many levels. First off, assault rifles extend to far beyond AR-15s (AR stands for Armalite Rifle), do not require bump *stocks* to be qualified as assault rifles, and cosmetic changes are irrelevant.
1991 2018-05-15 01:48:21 Spotify teaming up with IG was probably the smartest decision ever. So I made a note to buy stocks when the market opens tomorrow.
1992 2018-05-15 01:46:59 This was based on something I saw on Masterchef Jr., and wanted to try. It wasn’t hard, like you said, just labor intensive.

But it came out because I was patient. I can’t wait to try more things in it, other stocks, et cetera.
1993 2018-05-15 01:46:56 The banning of bump stocks does nothing to alleviate the epidemic of murders of children in schools, or anywhere else.  Assault weapons like the AR-15, the weapon of choice for these crazed assassins are still going to be widely available, as before. A token gesture by the NRA.

1999 2018-05-15 01:39:08 The released FIT police report.. the only guns in the room that had bump stocks the AR-15's most didn't even have sights on them. So that makes it even harder to believe.

2016 2018-05-15 01:18:30 One thing we do know for a fact.. is majority of guns that had bump stocks didn't have sights to aim down. See odd to plan to shoot people with no sights on your guns.

2019 2018-05-15 01:16:30 so what does that imply for energy stocks?
2020 2018-05-15 01:16:27 There’s a snow job happening now. Trump new plan for lowering drug prices is having Europeans pay more for drugs. Big windfall for drug companies. Buy drug stocks and gun stocks.    just realized it’s guns, drugs and hotels. Boo yah!
2021 2018-05-15 01:15:32 Can I ask if you trade aim stocks and the differences between USA and uk stocks in terms of trading
2022 2018-05-15 01:15:04 @business @markets #Asia #SofiaCostaEHorta : The MSCI Asia adding those stocks to its index is like the stocks in the S&P500. It's Nada!!!
2023 2018-05-15 01:13:38 I think they’d want to go for a playoff spot tho, especially with Sloot/Quig further along with their careers and Stocks having a losing season as her only bulletpoint on her head coaching resume. At some point I can see her start but we’ll see how the season goes

2025 2018-05-15 01:11:43 Call the sectional title managers in.  Have corporate body meetings every 3 months.  Just cos you got some votes, doesn't mean you can fix sewerage or rubbish collection.  Or reintroduce stocks where rate payers can pelt Councillors with rotten eggs each month. In lunch hour!
2026 2018-05-15 01:11:23 And around here, it depends on what the pharmacy stocks. Childproof-only is standard, but those pharmacies have non-childproof by request.  Others just go reversible.

2031 2018-05-15 01:00:02 Perplexed:  does the additive market cap of stocks in an ETF = the market cap of the of the ETF?  If so, how do the stocks readjust on ETF gap movements?

2033 2018-05-15 00:55:03 Stocks in gaming sector climbed following the decision by the U.S Supreme Court to let states permit sports betting. @CaesarsPalace rose .65 cents, or 5.5%, to $12.55 and Penn National Gaming climbed 1.51, or 4.7%, to 33.75%
2034 2018-05-15 00:54:17 God is real and he trades stocks and he’s on twitter lol
2035 2018-05-15 00:54:07 No History Nerd, it doesn’t work like that. Pay attention to the deficit and debt soaring up. Tax cuts to the rich does not trickle down, never worked before (check history) they will have to cover for all the money that the top will pocket and buy back stocks.
2036 2018-05-15 00:53:03 $NVS is so corrupt. After  pushing them to develop Gleevec/Glivec (imatinib mesylate) "it's only leukemia...see if it (STI-571) works in breast, lung or colon cancer" they forced me out after 23 years and stole $250.000 worth of my hard earned stocks.

2038 2018-05-15 00:50:43 Energy stocks gained 0.6% as U.S crude settled up 0.4% at $70.96 a barrel
2039 2018-05-15 00:44:52 Ah ahí va. En uno tipo tobin 69 cambia el tc aunque sea con stocks. Igual en ese caso el efecto cuantitativo debería ser mucho menor que en el argumento flujista, no? Que en mi cabeza esta estadisticamente asociado a ignorar las expectativas.
2040 2018-05-15 00:44:13 Yeah, many of these guidelines were made up by a generation that got through college w/o loans and counted on perpetually rising salaries, stocks, & real estate. So the conventional wisdom on retirement is... nice, I guess?, but not practical for the current generation.
2041 2018-05-15 00:43:25 Cannabis stocks all over the news tonight. Might mean more volume tomorrow. Even Dana Larsen was commenting on stock prices.. activist turned investor?
2042 2018-05-15 00:42:59 Stocks clam on Monday
2043 2018-05-15 00:42:52 sloppy.  #TeamPatriot Stuff like this just burns me and then I remember she self edits, won't listen to criticism and is a #propaganda tool  paid by Murdoch and her stocks.
2044 2018-05-15 00:42:09 Not much.  But gambling is rigged against you winning be its nature.  The stock market is not (arguably). The loss, however, is immediate.  Stocks are regulated so your risk is lower.  The next pony you bet on with the rent is not.
2045 2018-05-15 00:40:09 Stocks refreshed, mam! Pasensya na po. You can pre-order now 
2046 2018-05-15 00:40:00 I'm a fan of these cloud stocks pulling back.  Keep pulling back... i'll be there to buy ya up.

2048 2018-05-15 00:39:47 Dije otra cosa. Podés pensar el TC con stocks e igual no se sigue lo 2do. En un modelo de portafolio si vendés sin cambiar las expectativas afectás el TC
2049 2018-05-15 00:39:41 Ang dami naman kasing ingsegregate na stocks
2050 2018-05-15 00:39:02 Do you ever get that crush on someone for years and build this idea of them in your mind and get crazy but when you finally know them, they're this different like they actually like The Chainsmokers or they think twitter is stupid and that no one should invest in its stocks?
2051 2018-05-15 00:38:35 I heard stocks stuff be fake sometimes
2052 2018-05-15 00:37:45 European stocks closed mostly lower, with investors tracking developments in Italian politics after two populist parties said they had reached a deal to form a new government.
2053 2018-05-15 00:35:43 I am also 35 & I just got insanely excited that I can cash (with tax) out a lot of my work stocks so I have any savings at all to speak of, because until 2 years ago I was only able to get temp contracts because WA tech companies don’t like keeping people.
2054 2018-05-15 00:35:15 So basically keeping everyone on their toes. Depends on what program they run tomorrow trading stocks back and forth between etf's.  $spx $spy
2055 2018-05-15 00:35:05 Checking out updated Enterprise Value (EV):EBITDA multiples for some stocks - Super Cheap Auto ($SUL) was trading at 15.1x PE however the EV:EBITDA was 7.0 and after premium for control(25%) was 7.6x - still much better than Myer ($MYR) trading at 2.7x EV:EBITDA
2056 2018-05-15 00:31:47 Bdubs to watch the rockets beat the warriors . Might even yak about a few currencies and stocks even commodities.
2057 2018-05-15 00:28:35 $BABA $MA $AAPL $NVDA and other stocks are supported at the 4 day EMA while $NOW has fallen below this short term support.
2058 2018-05-15 00:27:12 I can’t believe he invests in stocks now
2059 2018-05-15 00:26:54 Chinese stocks seem to be in midst of a rally now.
2060 2018-05-15 00:26:08 Alina! will previous items that still have stocks from the last LQS be available during this coming LQS? 
2061 2018-05-15 00:24:58 Hey Nancy,  what if that happened and We The People cashed in our stocks and emptied our bank accounts before you pillaged them. Things would pucker up in a hurry!
2062 2018-05-15 00:24:08 Lihog lang ko sa mga may pick up di sa balay lihog lang ko. Kay gaka pending akon stocks dri sa balay. Lihog ko pick up today. Kay ma puli nko sa bacolod.
2063 2018-05-15 00:17:12 In the end, due to its functionality, I find myself using Thinkorswim to monitor, screen and track stocks, and use IQ edge for orders.   Thanks.
2064 2018-05-15 00:16:57 anyone have any knowledge/advice about purchasing stocks? lemme know
2065 2018-05-15 00:16:13 I have a few questions about the desktop version of IQ edge: 1) screeners for OTC stocks: why can’t you select stocks less than $0.001 ? 2) Orders: can you save your setups? 3) Orders: conditions are not very functional.
2066 2018-05-15 00:15:57 Hence the big donations to his "fixer" Atty Cohen. No wonder Pharmaceutical stocks went way up after Trump's speech. Just like everything else associated with The Donald. it is nothing but a con game as all things benefit him and screw the rest of us.
2067 2018-05-15 00:15:43 Learned that the Supreme Court finally figured out it unconstitutional to prohibit sports betting, making this like stocks now and having underdog betters have a chance now.
2068 2018-05-15 00:13:06 Latin American stocks lead the way lower with rising rates with a rising dollar. $EWW last closed the week below $47 about 14 mo's ago and could cause another round of selling. About 10 % below it's MA's so perhaps it's good time to start accumulating.

2071 2018-05-15 00:09:10 2. A portfolio that only consist of Berkshire Hathaway stock is more 'diversified' than a 20 stocks portfolio that are involved in the same industry.
2072 2018-05-15 00:09:00 1. How diversified or concentrated a portfolio is has little to do with the number of stocks in it. An equally weighted 10 stocks portfolio is less 'concentrated' than one with 30 stocks where 80% is staked in a single stock
2073 2018-05-15 00:08:56 Is anyone else noticing the flurry of small and mid-sized companies issuing profit warnings? Automotive Holdings $AHG the latest... (in a looong queue) #ausbiz #XJO #investing #stocks #equities

2076 2018-05-15 00:07:46 Asia stocks begin with modest gains after similar US lead, where reduced trade concerns underpinned sentiment and the DJIA posted its longest run of gains since September despite resistance near 25k level; ASX 200 (+0.2%), Nikkei 225 (+0.1%), KOSPI (Unch)

2078 2018-05-15 00:06:09 they are used as savings because the equity premium is about 6%. So people make money. That is why they buy stocks.
2079 2018-05-15 00:04:35 Bump stocks are purely for amusement. I would never own one myself, and could care less if they were banned.

2083 2018-05-15 00:03:08 $TRCH? Any thoughts please? Thanks!
