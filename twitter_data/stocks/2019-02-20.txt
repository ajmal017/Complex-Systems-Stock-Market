Technical gains from here may be a challenge to come.

Psei 7500 - 7700 interesting zone March - May - July

There is more to learn! 

Investors look for progress from this week’s trade negotiations in Washington.
1 2019-02-20 23:57:20 No one taught us shit about investing in high school.  Watching Mad Money now and Cramer just outlined ways to teach kindergarteners to pick stocks of brands they see everyday.  Imagine your kid being a knowledgeable investor by age 10.
2 2019-02-20 23:56:34 El Kirchnerismo quemó todos los stocks posibles que te permiten que en caso de una crisis tener una estabilización. Ni hablar que vendieron dollar link, defaulteo los bonos CER, quemó reservas internacionales y dejó el tendal de conflictos en el CIADI (pasivos contingentes)
3 2019-02-20 23:56:09 I just want to thank @BuyMyDesigns. His Rose Pack was the first design pack I ever bought. And at the time I was a trash designer. But seeing the techniques he used in the PSD's and how he made the stocks inspired me and after that moment is when I started to actually improve.

5 2019-02-20 23:54:53 Aren't stocks pretty much owned by folks who are rich already? Do you think they're going to upset the apple cart? Nader suggested a sales tax on all stock transactions some years ago. Still seems like a great idea.

7 2019-02-20 23:54:00 Nobody is sitting on cash and especially not looking down. It's invested everywhere, in the US Bonds to keep the country afloat, in stocks that hire workers, in local businesses and apartments to house people, in venture funds that may never pan out or become the next Amazon.
8 2019-02-20 23:53:48 A focus on IP will also begin to emerge. This is a huge story line that is getting very little spotlight and I believe to the be the best sector to invest in for 2019. I look forward to sharing ideas, talking about the future and discussing stocks in this sector.

12 2019-02-20 23:52:20 As I taught my 5th graders about the stock market crash and people buying stocks on credit, I had to stop myself from starting FPU in my classroom.  @DaveRamsey
13 2019-02-20 23:51:38 Listen David. I think we should just “virtually shake hands” because we obviously agree to disagree. And I know a lot about business. I grew up in a family where business was a big part of our lives. From property to trading stocks. I know my argument has standing.
14 2019-02-20 23:51:25 Other than that because I’m not starting with penny stocks
15 2019-02-20 23:51:13 If we can agree that stocks cannot continue to rise in a straight line in perpetuity, what is the catalyst that restores common sense to the market? Or is it just the fact that Trump and the Fed have pretty much sold all of their snake oil at this point?
16 2019-02-20 23:50:22 Yes yes yes! Kids want us to fix things for them. Missing out on problem solving skills.
17 2019-02-20 23:50:04 $SPN breaks down below $5 watchout not sure what ground floor is after that #stocks #tradingstrategy #ShortsGame #MoneyTalks
18 2019-02-20 23:50:00 Another solid day in @Magictickers 

Watchlist took a while to take off but ended up very green on high probability plays! $IDEX +30% $GALT +9% $ASTC +10% $HROW +7.5%

We had multiple others but these were my favorites. 56.5% on solid TA plays!! Great day!!
