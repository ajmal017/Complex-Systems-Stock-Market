43 2018-01-29 23:56:17 @realDonaldTrump Why are Oil prices moving Up so Rapidly. There is no shortage. Please have DOJ look into Traders pushing it up for their Benfit including Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan that forecast it at 70. Just becoz people are getting raises.bonus,Tax relief. All svgs wiped out
44 2018-01-29 23:55:31 Use virgin olive oil
45 2018-01-29 23:54:57 It's more than that although the bank loans got trump started with Russia. Ongoing  money laundering for Russia for what at least 25 years. Russian sanctions not implemented. Steele DOSSIER trump gets 19% of 500 billion dollar oil deal Exxon Russia
46 2018-01-29 23:54:55 From what I read of the comments, it seems to be the oil?

48 2018-01-29 23:54:50 @CaelusEnergyAK: Working toward first oil from our Nuna field by late 2019- could produce 30,000 barrels of oil per day at peak production. #akleg

55 2018-01-29 23:53:41 I made fried eggs in olive oil cause I ran out of butter and I’m here to tell you to never make this mistake,just eat them raw or something.

58 2018-01-29 23:53:23 So when your newsletter acknowledged that you get at least some money from "big oil," that referred to P. Eng. consulting firms? 

Right.

62 2018-01-29 23:53:02 No.  The Italian word is Indo-European in origin and etymologically means “sharp” (cognate with English “acetic”) while the Spanish word comes from an Arabic root meaning “oil”. (2 of 2)
63 2018-01-29 23:52:54 I would hope that, given his success, #JeffBezos would show massively gracious support to the country/world that allowed him to profit so much. How about a #LivingWage for employees, and take on the oil industry with 100% #Electric #Solar for .@amazon? #Greed

66 2018-01-29 23:52:19 Blair left, after his well-meaning trysts into Iraq, had squandered much of Britain's financial resources, with no oil to justify it.
67 2018-01-29 23:52:18 Thank you I've been hashtagging the Russian Sanctions for months. How can we sit here and not demand that he signs? Sign the Sanctions n maybe we'll talk about that stupid wall. DACA NOW. As Russian ships import oil n laugh.

69 2018-01-29 23:52:04 We have been paying oil and gas money, taxpayer money, for years.  Seems to me that congressonly wants what their donors want and not their constituents.  That amount is only a drop in the bucket to their environmental impact.
70 2018-01-29 23:52:02 I’m sorry but olive oil is honestly trash
71 2018-01-29 23:51:58 @EricHolder the snake oil salesman Trump will wreck this government before he go down
72 2018-01-29 23:51:55 In today’s episode of “how do I sneak joint supplements into my dog” she found the fish oil pill in the pizza crust. She’s no idiot.

75 2018-01-29 23:51:36 So? Like I said everyone jumps to the oil field I have tons of cousins and uncles who are big ass bosses who make so much they don’t know what to do with it. I can easily get a job just like you but that’s not what I would ever want for myself but alright good for you
76 2018-01-29 23:51:36 gee..wonder what oil company lobbyists asked for this one #eliminatesafetyoversightagency
77 2018-01-29 23:51:18 Getting rid of Klopp won’t solve anything, at least not drastically. I wish we could get bought out by some Chinese businessman or Oil mogul as much as I hate to say it
78 2018-01-29 23:51:14 They are attempting to undermine ourDemocracy,overtake our govtThey will stop at NOTHING.Nov is too far awayHacked Board of Elections,didnt implement new RU sanctions,didnt condemPutin for arrest politic adversary,tanker in Boston harbor now delivering RU oil,violation sanctions
79 2018-01-29 23:51:11 meh, oil is a small market dwarfed by the speculative interest. not brave enough to short it but fore sure somewhat too late to get on the long oil trade seriously :/

83 2018-01-29 23:50:50 For how long the world is going to suffer over oil bullshiting..? Should we all go to stone age again, just for another barrel to be sold? You can also put a half of the world's population in your oil springs, it would add some extra calories, ya know?? ;;
84 2018-01-29 23:50:44 So what are you saying we will have wars and commodity rush over sunshine like oil. Your Statement has little to do with this thread about solar power and nothing to do with my statement. In fact your statement makes no sense to me at all. And bringing communism into it?!!

86 2018-01-29 23:50:10 #gop are you paying a lot more at the gas pump to fill up your car? It is because tRump and the GOP are selling all of our oil to other countries while we pay more. So your $60 dollar tax cut won’t come close to paying for the gas increase. Also tRumpcare has huge increases.

93 2018-01-29 23:49:32 Italian aceto and Spanish aceite - you’ll find them in the Italian and Spanish phrases for “oil and vinegar” but the two similar-looking words don’t mean the same thing.  Aceto is Italian for vinegar and aceite is Spanish for olive oil.  Are the Spaniards confused? (1 of 2)
94 2018-01-29 23:49:27 Biggest irony I've seen is college kids who are environmentalists protesting against #BigOil, yet their parents who happen to work for Big Oil also pay for those same kids' college education.
95 2018-01-29 23:49:19 I think I almost attacked @jackgoesforth one time when he asked if the cast iron could go in the dishwasher. He now just leaves it on the stove where I can play “I will always love you” while I gently massage it with olive oil after its cleaning.
96 2018-01-29 23:49:15 Lmao do I care? Everyone goes to the oil field I work and go to school hit me up in 3 years when I’m done with school and we’ll compare money.

Exxon Mobile is a US Big Oil Co who's doing what they do ... drill. They've been drilling & pumping in those areas.

110 2018-01-29 23:47:56 do yourself a favor, splash some italian spices (rosemary and basil!) on your brussel sprouts before you bake them, along with salt, pepper, and olive oil

112 2018-01-29 23:47:32 I wish my dry eyes look as beautiful as hers. But the late afternoon I am so miserable. The only thing that had helped me at all is putting organic castor oil in them before I go to bed.

115 2018-01-29 23:47:03 The return on solar is fantastic.  Its getting cheaper every day. We need renewables for many reasons, including national security. Wars for oil are bankrupting us. Renewables are more than competitive in a fair, free market.
116 2018-01-29 23:46:46 Kate Blair with @andeavor is testifying now on HB 288: We use mostly AK crude in our operations. Please consider the impact on both oil production and AK jobs as you debate HB 288. #akleg
117 2018-01-29 23:46:38 The Bible  referred  to Cannibus as Kaneh  bosem. Jesus  use it in anointing oil, for healing eye & skin diseases.  Evil replaced this HEALING HERB with another that does NOTHING! Cannibus  was important  in Judaic  Christian  Religion!

123 2018-01-29 23:45:27 The UAE's interest relates to securing one of the busiest oil and gas shipping lanes located at the South of Yemen.

Protecting the flow of the oil and gas shipment in the region, it gives them upperhand to trade with Europe & North America.
124 2018-01-29 23:44:56 Offshore drilling onshore drilling all the oil in the whole world and we cannot seem to find a better solution for production of energy.

Rex Tillerson as SOS was to get this deal done.

137 2018-01-29 23:43:19 As someone traveling to the @IndyEleven game do you think there are any downsides to the game being at Lucas Oil? I can’t think of any other than the rumor I heard that they will only seat one side of stadium to make it appear full on tv.
138 2018-01-29 23:43:16 Exxon Mobile is not a new company investing in the US & creating new jobs. This is an oil co doing what it does. You're pushing your Middle Class Tax Rape BULL SHIT too far when you've got 10's of thousands losing their jobs ... 93k jobs being outsourced & moved overseas.
139 2018-01-29 23:43:10 Chef Gusteau cut up some bars of soap, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was some  human flesh, along with toothpaste.
140 2018-01-29 23:43:04 The EU is why Scotland got its Parliament, guidelines. EU ignorance of Catalonia now appalling but that was reason back then, nothing to do with Westminster and all to do with being in EU. That’s why the UK Government wants to Brexit, they need Scotlands oil not our Parliament.

149 2018-01-29 23:41:56 I'm _hoping_ it's someone's pet that had managed to get something nasty on its coat (eg let outside and hid under a car with an oil leak), but I wish I had more faith that was the actual explanation.
150 2018-01-29 23:41:45 I am THIS  close to dipping myself in fuckin kitchen oil to see if my skin stops being so DRY
151 2018-01-29 23:41:43 I feel like even if my arm was falling off beauty gurus would just tell me to use coconut oil
152 2018-01-29 23:41:43 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.

163 2018-01-29 23:40:23 It’s not unlike saying oil built nigeria that we see. Yes other factors contributed but oil has predominated and fueled our economy. So did Slavery but for longer and it was far more integrated.

183 2018-01-29 23:37:28 @OwenBenjamin bit premise. Women dont fight for equality on oil rigs, garbage men, etc
184 2018-01-29 23:37:23 Fossil fuel usage has been on the rise as demand dictates, absolutely. But alt/“green” tech also has. Over the next few decades it will surpass oil because tech grows at an exponential rate. The more we do the easier and cheaper it is to do even more and more.
185 2018-01-29 23:37:06 I swear, if I’m allergic to this hair serum that I just bought just because I didn’t know ‘Persea gratissima oil’ is avocado oil, I will punch someone 
186 2018-01-29 23:36:40 @DanielAndrewsMP placed a ban on gas exploration in Victoria. If new reserves were found, the price of gas would plummet. He refuses to fund projects aimed at developing technologies which convert brown coal to liquid fuel to decrease our dependence on expensive imported oil.

189 2018-01-29 23:36:26 Bills are done, invoices are made, I picked up my oil and filter for my car, I did my exchange at Pier One. I worked 7-2, helped rons Mom move furniture, booked my hotel and vacation with Ron, and now trying to get my new vanity mirror on my vanity. WHAT A DAY

... it's okay, you've swallowed worse warm fluids, you can have that pizza
202 2018-01-29 23:33:18 I'm not really picky where you start the extraction. Oil drilling, wind farming... The point is much more that extraction like transformation require both effort and luck, so if you prefer you can consider it a special case of a transformative industry.

211 2018-01-29 23:32:32 Actually if u really start looking you’ll find that oil companies are heavily exploring a transition to becoming energy companies. They see the writing on the wall and they are already planning for it. This is not a token gesture, this is the future and they know it.

219 2018-01-29 23:32:07 They are really good drops tina at work we not able to recommend them as some one had bad reaction to them so we have to say olive oil or almond oil but I know my friend maura who's a nurse who claims the sodium ones are so much better for clearing wax
220 2018-01-29 23:32:01 I'd like you to show me one tribe that actually pronounces as Oil
221 2018-01-29 23:31:54 We don't need more fossil fuels if we don't want more climate change. The science is clear--we don't want more @exxonmobil, unless they suddenly give up oil and move to renewables.

246 2018-01-29 23:27:39 I use it mixed w lavender oil for my psoriasis. After my shower I put coconut oil on my body and I use it as a makeup remover. My skin is really sensitive and it’s acne prone but it works fine as a moisturizer bc I have really dry skin.
247 2018-01-29 23:27:37 That's the irony. They can't talk down oil now to undermine #ScotRef without devaluing #Sterling which undermines #Brexit
248 2018-01-29 23:27:25 need to try that coconut oil with pop corns thing ASAP!
249 2018-01-29 23:27:15 A mere drop in the ocean compared to the amounts being plunged into City who wouldn't make profit without such huge sums from an oil billionaire.

254 2018-01-29 23:25:54 I wanted to be boujee and do something good for my skin so i bought a $40 face oil from sephora and it did more harm than good now i have a bunch of little bumps on my face, moral of the story stay a cheap bitch and let your skin do it’s thing
255 2018-01-29 23:25:53 I can go 3 days without washing mine! But that but I had to build up to it. Over time your scalp will produce less oil so it’s not so bad
256 2018-01-29 23:25:47 When is it going to translate into our standard of living Garri, yam beans rice,Irish potatoes, palm oil fuel kerosene even agbalumu, is still very expensive. Is @APCNigeria waiting for Nigerians to die finish before they will do something?
257 2018-01-29 23:25:44 Just gotta get the oil to make that booty a shiny hiney
258 2018-01-29 23:25:43 Clearly that tea tree oil cleanser did not do as advertised as now I have even more spots than before. I don;t think I've had a spot-free day in my life.
259 2018-01-29 23:25:33 Since birds and ducks have natural oils on them that makes their feathers hydrophobic, which is why they face the worst consequences in an oil spill. If you put oil on a duck and oil on a bird and throw them at each other, would they stick together upon contact?
260 2018-01-29 23:25:24 and you can suck it (oil). Trudeau.
261 2018-01-29 23:25:21 So trump rolls back EPA standards, wants to keep coal, signed an EO nullifiying the social cost of carbon, pulled out of the Paris climate agreement, signed an EO nullifying oil/gas pollution standard, etc etc. And you're ok with this but not China's pollution?
262 2018-01-29 23:24:50 You think without brains
Disarming has a very specific meaning.  We are taking nothing.  We are just not giving more. This has nothing to do with markets. We cannot cone into conflict with a NATO ally. It's that simple. This ME conflict for once has nothing to do with oil.  Idiot
263 2018-01-29 23:24:47 I get the issue behind it, as some black women get fired from their jobs for wearing braids or their natural hair, meanwhile Kylie Jenner can wear dreads and get praised for it but when Zendaya did the same, she was referred to as someone who smells like weed and oil. However,
264 2018-01-29 23:24:46 If your skin is feeling extra dry use a body oil instead of a lotion.
265 2018-01-29 23:24:31 How much the oil industry subsidies?
266 2018-01-29 23:24:19 Development of nuclear into a cleaner safer source is entirely possible. It was centuries before we realized oil was usable, decades until it was refined. Nuclear meltdowns definitely happen less than oil spills 
267 2018-01-29 23:24:09 they flee because your county is trying to steal their oil , and destabilising their government,by dividing the people to create a civil-war Ps ,could you imagine if they discover oil in north korea  and the supreme leader convert to Islam
268 2018-01-29 23:24:07 Great thing about parabolic trends, they rise faster and faster, so in order not to break down, price has to rise faster and faster until it no longer can... only a matter of time before oil breaks down, sooner rather than later imho.
269 2018-01-29 23:23:56 I’m so happy about this coconut oil 
270 2018-01-29 23:23:55 I have seen sth similar to that before where the point was ~then that they use palm oil. The cake one is stupid Im you can make a cake??? and see??? that people don't know what's in food they only buy is a worry. then also a worry they dk what's in food a lot of people make lol.
271 2018-01-29 23:23:49 Had one of the best sleeps in months! Eucalyptus essential oil helps a lot, in fair. Magandang Umaga!

277 2018-01-29 23:22:41 a club like Arsenal absolutely has to raise cash when it is looking at replacing the entire spine of the team simultaneously. But even the oil clubs sell on 3rd choice strikers for good cash. Look at City and Dzeko.
278 2018-01-29 23:22:21 About to burn this midnight oil
279 2018-01-29 23:22:16 THC Oil from a syringe makes me feel dirty
280 2018-01-29 23:22:14 @BP_Alaska: Two barrels of oil are in the ground for every barrel of oil the world will need in the future: competition will be fierce for deciding which barrels are produced versus left in the ground. Where will the investment go? Policy will dictate. #akleg
281 2018-01-29 23:22:00 I use Aveeno.... super sensitive skin/massive allergies, that's all I can use! But when all else fails, olive oil soak it is! Honest! It works! Just messy ;)
282 2018-01-29 23:21:58 New business w/ Russia DT ?
Well could it be those oil/gas deals maybe which will fill > Putin$$$
so he can con't interfer in US+other Nations elections+wage expanded wars
+bully NATO+EU on borders ? DT+GOP do NOT rep American majority
283 2018-01-29 23:21:52 Nah it's literally pepper salad my country ass mom calls it that and that's what it is! Onions pepper vinegar oil and some more lil shit 
284 2018-01-29 23:21:51 BTW The vast majority of oil & gas field jobs are temporary. They are one of the largest groups to get unemployment. The companies get rich, the workers use government assistance. You ready for that, Texas? Trump & pence won’t be helping with that expense.
285 2018-01-29 23:21:50 Hard drugs are for people who like checking levels

Go change some oil instead
286 2018-01-29 23:21:47 Data is the new oil
287 2018-01-29 23:21:28 Hindi ako pinadaan kaya lalakad ako papalayo.Lilisan dala ang lungkot.Sayang ang lipstick at baby oil.Kauyam.
288 2018-01-29 23:21:25 Nadie hablo de bajar el gas Oil un 22% a leer mas
289 2018-01-29 23:21:23 Oils Deep State a Canadian book about the regulatory capture of Albertan politics by big oil.  Current to today's date.
290 2018-01-29 23:21:18 The oil and gas industry recives over $400 Billion in direct federal subsidies every year and have for decades! What were they waiting for? More benefits off the backs of hard working tax payers
291 2018-01-29 23:21:17 YES! Great post, Abbie! I've had people dm that I was a horrible human for suggesting people look into CBD oil for their ailments. I ignored them but come on. Do some research! It's not right for everyone but at least look into it before you completely dismiss, ya know?
292 2018-01-29 23:21:17 You know you’re getting older when the only gifts you want is stuff like an oil change, groceries, a bill paid & household products
293 2018-01-29 23:21:17 Fr it coconut oil was in every thread about skin care
294 2018-01-29 23:21:09 Bitch i forgot i got these kush cakes and CBD oil  it’s bout to be a good night
295 2018-01-29 23:20:54 ok. eggplant fried in a bucket of oil infused with a little garlic and rosemary. basil mayo. mozz. sauteed cav. nero with chilli flakes. more oil. teensy drop of sherry vinegar. think that's I?
296 2018-01-29 23:20:48 大和って書いとけば勝ちなところある
297 2018-01-29 23:20:35 Let's see him show up to have conversations (not do speeches) at homeless shelters, food banks, local community clinics to help poor people, and any job site where workers are paid poverty wages and also at reservations where tribes fought against big oil pipe lines...
298 2018-01-29 23:20:31 Hahaha!!! Fair enough. For me, it’s all about the broth, and nobody does it like him. The beef fat floaty things in broth, and when you ask for brisket, it’s actually brisket, not some processed roast beef slice. And the chilli oil is perfect there as welll.
299 2018-01-29 23:20:29 Just took myself out with some cod liver oil.  I think it’s the most disgusting substance known to man.
300 2018-01-29 23:20:28 Steamed with butter and garlic olive oil, Himalayan salt,  white pepper
301 2018-01-29 23:20:23 PSA: shave with baby oil your hair will grow back thin and soft 
302 2018-01-29 23:20:17 Want company just so I can get rubbed down in some oil 
303 2018-01-29 23:20:03 普通に足痛い
304 2018-01-29 23:19:59 Noooo wtfff  use a lil bit of baby oil. Sucking out all the oil of it, is what makes it dry. & Try not to leave it out open .
305 2018-01-29 23:19:54 deciding if my oil pastel experiment is too embarrassing to show.
306 2018-01-29 23:19:53 US energy companies poised to produce 10 million barrels of oil per day ! Not seen in almost 50 years... Energy Independence is now Energy Domination !
307 2018-01-29 23:19:51 If you have ever paid full price for an oil change at valvoline your an idiot literally all you have to do is say you’re poor and they will give you at least $10 off it ain’t hard
308 2018-01-29 23:19:45 Oh my god do oil paintings are supreme aesthetic #unironicirony
309 2018-01-29 23:19:35 ダイエットしていたって、時にはオイルも必要だろう?
310 2018-01-29 23:19:18 @ManukaCafe can the oil be ingested?
311 2018-01-29 23:19:14 That's right, Junior. They have respect for the law, the Constitution, democracy. And they fully understand the checks and balances between our 3 branch's. Go back to hocking your snake oil.
312 2018-01-29 23:19:13 couuuld be wrong but i thought the Outrage over the separated-layer nutella picture was 'cause it's got palm oil in it, no? or was it just. somehow surprising to people that its got a lot of sugar in it?
313 2018-01-29 23:19:02 there’s a little bit of oil in a lot of the things you consume. Same with sugar. *most* people don’t eat an entire jar of Nutella in one sitting, so it’s not like you’re ingesting all of this at an unhealthy rate
314 2018-01-29 23:19:00 The best thing about #essentialoils is that they have basically completely changed my entire witchy practice. Abundance? I got oils for that. Self-love? There's an oil. Manifestation? Oils. Grounding? Oils.
315 2018-01-29 23:18:55 Oddly disconcerting I know, considering the EU’s ignorance of Catalonia these days, but yes that was the reason back then, nothing to do with Westminster and all to do with EU guidelines. That’s why the UK Government wants to Brexit, they need Scotlands oil not our Parliament.
316 2018-01-29 23:18:52 another win for the Russian GOP (gas and oil party)!   The Russian coup is nearly complete...
317 2018-01-29 23:18:43 All that money floating around yet somehow the American middle class is still waiting for it to land. Of course they’re investing, Gas prices & crude oil prices are going up!!
318 2018-01-29 23:18:34 「Listen Hyodo, the only person who has a power in Iran to make a decision about oil blocks is Majesty and us in the Royal family.」
319 2018-01-29 23:18:24 Always salt your pasta while boiling. Also, with thicker noodles like fettuccini and linguine the noodles like to stick together. Add a teaspoon of olive oil to avoid a ruined pot.
320 2018-01-29 23:18:22 Aaaand the van is out of oil >< Thankfully a nice police man is helping us out. I like old cars but idk wtf to do with engines and shit XD
321 2018-01-29 23:18:07 Sell to buy is just another revenue stream like another. Helps us compete with the oil rich. Is an rich Arab our only alternative?
322 2018-01-29 23:18:01 There is a delicious Cara Cara Orange infused fresh extra virgin olive oil. If you tell me your zip code, I'll show you the closest place to get it. Or, I can give you a web address you can order from anywhere.
323 2018-01-29 23:17:53 OIL BRENT US$69.37/bbl -1.66%. Exxon plans US$50bn investment in US business, citing tax cuts. Includes Permian Basin field expansion.
324 2018-01-29 23:17:49 Yeah, the reason any of us have navies and armies that we keep upgrading every year is to prevent our neighbors from invading our islands and the oil resources surrounding them.
325 2018-01-29 23:17:41 I'm sure the oil companies would have preferred that everyone just let Qaddafi regain control and let the oil keep flowing.

The idea of invading someone for their oil when they're already selling it to you is pretty stupid.
326 2018-01-29 23:17:39 This guy makes me turn off the TV.  How do these snake oil salesmen get elected?
327 2018-01-29 23:17:32 You're welcome! Argan oil might help too.
328 2018-01-29 23:17:28 Fish oil pills wine two doses of spliffed dried banna organic thank lots of water thank me later
329 2018-01-29 23:17:27 眠いし痛いし
330 2018-01-29 23:17:20 Face masks, messaging oil, moisturizing lotion, acne something. I'm trying to think of stuff but my brain isn't working rn 
331 2018-01-29 23:17:17 I met a young man who worked the oil lines for 7 years. Crippled hands and many other problems. Why isn’t @OSHA_DOL overseeing working conditions for these “awesome” jobs. How do you sleep at night?
332 2018-01-29 23:17:08 Umm, so you don't see Oil executives, Big Pharma employees, and other shareholders of big corporations that now hold government office not people that are of the sewer? Yet you see this guy one that has been going this actual job helping protect America as such?
333 2018-01-29 23:17:03 @ZahrahMusa how much is a bag of rice in your City, a Bag of Garri if you eat it at all, 4 litre of Palm Oil and a bowl of Kola But then I'll tell you how much we are buying in our city including a liter of fuel.
334 2018-01-29 23:16:46 1.) Marsh was sort of an old snake oil salesman, I actually met him at the seminar I heard about on the radio that morning. He claimed Irwin Schiff stole all his stuff, but I later heard it was the opposite. This is where I met some of the Citizens For Legal Reform People too...
335 2018-01-29 23:16:43 Supposedly Russia oil/gas is arriving in the East coast as we speak
336 2018-01-29 23:16:42 I'm like the olive oil, extra virgin
337 2018-01-29 23:16:40 Gotta go get an oil change after work 
338 2018-01-29 23:16:37 the indie oil perfumes are great! hmm i like lighter, fresh scents? not so much heavy stuff. any sort of spice is cool as are most flower/woodsy type scents!

honestly tho i’m open to anything
339 2018-01-29 23:16:30 夢の中で全力で人蹴ったら足の甲が痛い。壁蹴って起きましたとさ
340 2018-01-29 23:16:28 I use baby wipes with a few drops of almond oil. Makeup wipes always burn my eyes and they break me out
341 2018-01-29 23:16:22 So I’ve been putting aloe gel in my shampoo and I started using Argan oil and my hair feels so freakin bomb omg
342 2018-01-29 23:16:06 Another example or tech billionaires trying to sell education snake oil! Thanks @matt_barnum !
343 2018-01-29 23:16:02 You might've been using too much heat on the stove for the nutballs. Throughout the episode the oil was like a booby trap when you put something in it for the first time, -and- the nut balls got almost burned. Maybe just a notch down or something
344 2018-01-29 23:15:34 I realized this a few years ago watching the movie "Giant" with Cary Grant, Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean.   The daughter of the cattle/oil tycoon wanted a second phone line for an astronomical amount.   We are so spoiled.
345 2018-01-29 23:15:33 Oil Doesn't Work
346 2018-01-29 23:15:29 I’m sure it has nothing to do with trumpy removing regulations limiting drilling near the U.S. ... just what we need more oil drilling and raping of our natural resources...
347 2018-01-29 23:15:24 CENTRAL HOLD AREA. Luke begins wiping oil from here.
348 2018-01-29 23:15:19 Trying aromatherapy out for the first time in my cool mist humidifier and splashed the oil in my eye... Now def can't relax
349 2018-01-29 23:15:11 Our Grandmother Earth is under attack by Oil and Mining Companies who only care about money.  The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe is fighting to protect all peoples!  Join our fight and help us continue our fight to protect our Unci Maka. #NoDAPL #NoKXL #MniWiconi #WaterIsLife

351 2018-01-29 23:14:48 Emang meki cwe ga seenak pantat cwo mas?
Mas kalo ml suka pake pelicin v gel, body lotion atau baby oil?
352 2018-01-29 23:14:39 It's the same thing with people against big oil and pipelines, etc. So, are you willing to stop using petroleum-based products (i.e. shoes, makeup, general household products, etc.) -- or stop driving your car? No? Of course not. Empty gestures.
353 2018-01-29 23:14:24 Yes all the oil and gas workers I know many very little money
354 2018-01-29 23:14:16 Do Coconut Oil Pulling when you get home, Start taking Milk Thistle to protect your liver. There are a few other things that will pull toxins from your body.
& step up your hygiene, & use a cloth or cleansing wipe to touch elevator buttons, open doors, or to handle grocery carts
355 2018-01-29 23:14:07 I went in for an oil change and now I’ve accidentally triggered an episode...
356 2018-01-29 23:14:02 Rosemary & Olive Oil Bagel with Sausage & Egg
357 2018-01-29 23:13:54 Well, I guess it is good-bye to the environment in the Permian Basin, along with potable water, wildlife, and sustainable eco-tourism. Wild Texas was a thing of beauty. At least the oil & gas industry will be using their subsidies to make billions.
358 2018-01-29 23:13:38 masspriest to be shriven, holy housel and sick men's oil to his limbs.

360 2018-01-29 23:13:09 Hello all you pious imperialists, yes you. Early 50's Iran *elected* a socialist prime minister Mosadeq who set about implementing fundamental socialist change. He was ousted by a CIA-MI5 coup to protect OUR oil supplies, you've been enjoying that ever since.

362 2018-01-29 23:12:59 Thanks for the follow @EyewearTy my #50th follower
363 2018-01-29 23:12:45 Haha. Personally I love greasy English food & oil soaked Indian curries 
364 2018-01-29 23:12:43 Fresh mozzarelle marinated in oil with basil and scallions and a drizzle of balsamic OH YES
365 2018-01-29 23:12:25 @antonioguterres Sir, the #UN only continues to fail if African dictators and genociders must have their way, and if neo-colonialism  by #France must thrive in Africa. Yesterday it was blood diamond in Sierra Leone; Today it's blood oil in #SouthernCameroons .
366 2018-01-29 23:12:20 waiting to see change in my skin after 2nd day use of rosehip oil and the only change i see is two pimples it might be my period idk yet i’m sad
367 2018-01-29 23:11:57 Mine have bones and veg too , they're both 2 , i was told krill oil was too rich at that age?
368 2018-01-29 23:11:54 Rex Tillerson and Vladimir Putin Scheme is to drill for oil in the Arctic! That’s why Putin was put in touch with Tillerson! Secretary Of State my foot! Tillerson was put in here to tear down our Department of State! .......Where’s Trey Gowdy!?
369 2018-01-29 23:11:48 Can't wait until the taxpayers have to pay for another oil spill cleanup
370 2018-01-29 23:11:46 I want an #akleg member to ask these oil execs one simple question in regards to HB288;

Are you planning on developing in ANWR?
371 2018-01-29 23:11:45 Glacier Oil and Gas: Alaska has a bad reputation in the investment community, mainly because of constantly shifting tax policies, and challenges associated with operating in a smaller oil region. #akleg
372 2018-01-29 23:11:42 -Healthy natural fats I eat daily are: avocado, MCT (coconut) oil, heavy cream, bacon (only 2-4 slices,) cheese, meats, butter. 
-Join Instagram and search ketosis or keto, etc. There are thousands of recipes and photos of food that will give you ideas of meals you may like.
373 2018-01-29 23:11:29 I officially pronounce oil like a southern fuk
374 2018-01-29 23:11:26 @AntAnstead Just watched the Mitsubishi resto, it was interesting to see Mike as a passenger, hope there was no nail marks in the dash. Why no use of penetrating oil on the exhaust ? & no use of copper grease on refit?.
375 2018-01-29 23:11:25 I stood in the center of the sweltering 98 degree room, butt naked and covered head to toe in oil. 6 feet of lean muscle and pure fighting ability. Sleak, mean, and fully erect. The lights turned on and the audience raged. I was back, and damn it felt good...
376 2018-01-29 23:11:24 Dear Australian cafe chefs, please cease the following culinary crimes. 1. Overcooking and garlicking every veg you put on a plate. A mushroom is delicious with a little olive oil! 2. The beer battered chip. So passe, 90s and insulting to the puffy delicious potato within.
377 2018-01-29 23:11:07 Turned on the salt lamp, put some "serenity" in the essential oil diffuser and rolled out the yoga mat. It's about to get reeeeeal zen in here, folks.
378 2018-01-29 23:10:55 Has Friends of Science ever received money from an oil company? 

There's no law on the books that would preclude you from answering that question with a straightforward yes or no.
379 2018-01-29 23:10:50 We already know you favor higher deaths from transporting oil in trucks instead of in pipes.
380 2018-01-29 23:10:50 Wow a whole “12,000” jobs if that is the real number; now how many oil spills does that equate to? 
381 2018-01-29 23:10:49 マテウスーマテウスー飲みにいこーぜー
382 2018-01-29 23:10:29 サラダ油って体に悪いんですか？サラダなのに？
383 2018-01-29 23:10:20 the bizarre part is that her turn off was that it had oil in it . . . and not the fact that it's like 40% sugar.
384 2018-01-29 23:09:36 It contains palm oil.....no one should buy it
385 2018-01-29 23:09:32 Thanks for researching and correcting the misconception. I hope the person who covered it has a good explanation, like it had been contaminated with oil or something.
386 2018-01-29 23:09:31 Oil and water do not mix, as we all know.　　みんなが知っているように，油と水は混ざらない。
387 2018-01-29 23:09:28 And she spoke imploringly to ask for you must pour oil on their hinges, and was no way through that she is close at hand,
388 2018-01-29 23:09:18 Those "fans" dont have a clue mate.

Theyre the same fans who talk about "Chelski" having "no history" and City only being big because of "oil money", then the next minute are complaining about FSG and saying we need new owners so we can basically go and try and buy the title
389 2018-01-29 23:09:07 ให้หงุดหงิดแต่เช้า - -*
390 2018-01-29 23:09:06 I don't care what anyone or @colhutch says, he is Clive Carvers bitch and only he is pulling the strings. I am still of the opinion that the sp will be alot higher but would like a proper oil and gas man in charge. #AST
391 2018-01-29 23:09:04 I did overnight salt soaks & tea tree oil every other day for the one on my nose, went away in 2 weeks
392 2018-01-29 23:09:01 I did a face mask and I put coconut oil in my hair today I’m a whole brand new person don’t talk to me
393 2018-01-29 23:08:46 Glacier Oil and Gas: Lots of good news coming out of the oil patch: new fields, production increases in TAPS, more activity. On the negative side, there are fewer players in Alaska, which means fewer service companies. Becomes hard to do business. #akleg
394 2018-01-29 23:08:44 3K, that's one of the contract requirements to get the first three oil changes for free. :p
395 2018-01-29 23:08:32 I don't want a new car just an oil change
Come on kia
396 2018-01-29 23:08:22 A variety of grain free foods,  
1° one is w/salmon & pumpkin. 
Raw marrow long bones, occasionally crockpot cooked meat with mixed veggies and rice. And fresh greens hidden in food as much as possible. + Probiotics, krill oil.
397 2018-01-29 23:07:49 I have 7% oil life remaining. I probably shouldn’t of let it get that low huh?
398 2018-01-29 23:07:44 “In the world of upstream oil & gas... companies that were operators, actively producing oil & gas in commercial quantities that wanted to invest or participate in the oil business were the darlings of the industry... like the prettiest girl in high school” - Get Model Right.
399 2018-01-29 23:07:43 Unbelievable. This HRC on HB288 makes me want to rip off my skin. I cannot believe the threats these oil executives are throwing out.. 

"Tax us, and we won't develop." That's a load of BS when ANWR just opened up. The biggest expansion in over 20 years. SMGDH.

#akleg
400 2018-01-29 23:07:43 I wonder how many minimum wage jobs that will create? The answer is zero. Oil companies rarely pay minimum wage for anything.
401 2018-01-29 23:07:29 I'm an oil and gas professional on a six figure salary... I'm doing okay thanks...
402 2018-01-29 23:07:26 YES I’m a religious user of coconut oil. I usually put it in my hair every other day but it looks like I’m gonna have to do a full out treatment because nothing is working at the moment. Thank you!!
403 2018-01-29 23:07:16 So true. It’s all gone mad....pc mad. When we saw that in our house, we said “yes, our deep fried samosas, pakoras, curries cooked in half a pan of oil etc are all so healthy of course!”
404 2018-01-29 23:07:16 Oil is dead. Solar power is in. Get with it.
405 2018-01-29 23:07:09 @Babex_TV omfg @666TIFFANYC with oil this evening reminded me of the good old days she’s still the best without question X
406 2018-01-29 23:07:05 try tea tree oil, my sister was the same way and her skin got just how it used to be
407 2018-01-29 23:07:01 ปวดตาโว้ยย
408 2018-01-29 23:06:54 Haha yes!!! Canadian whiskey  is gooood!! Dry ginger, honey and lemon  in hot water. Also oil of oregano helps with throat and in general with infections. Don’t forget eat garlic. Trust me. It’s good natural antibiotic. 
409 2018-01-29 23:06:22 Remember the 70’s when we were slave to the same countries that have been destroying us for years cause we were let to believe they had all the oil. Long Gas lines, Rationing why are things so different forty years later
410 2018-01-29 23:06:13 I've drank nothing but water for almost a month now; dont feel healthier. Ive been taking fish oil for about two weeks tho and its rad way better mood no anxienty.
411 2018-01-29 23:06:13 ANOTHER BIG Oil & Gas Company? When Will Trump's Tax Cuts Restart Rust Belt Manufacturing? WHEN Will WE/Us See American Made Toys & Hammers On Store Shelves? We Know BIG OIL & GAS Always Gets The Breaks BUT? @SquawkCNBC @TuckerCarlson @Varneyco
412 2018-01-29 23:06:09 Make oil?
413 2018-01-29 23:06:08 Up next to testify on HB 288 is Carl Giesler with Glacier Oil and Gas, one of the newer, smaller companies in AK. They operate in both the Cook Inlet and on the North Slope. #akleg
414 2018-01-29 23:06:07 It isn’t our job to keep the doors greased just for one customer! Grease your wife up with your own damn fry oil!
415 2018-01-29 23:06:06 Hang in there guys. And if the author thing doesnt work out you can always fall back on being... *looks at notes* an oil baron.
416 2018-01-29 23:06:02 But you can do three oil changes with your hair.
417 2018-01-29 23:05:55 kicking the oil companies ass hard.
418 2018-01-29 23:05:47 You can always make unscented pure olive oil soap, it's GREAT on sensitive skins. Only bad thing though, it takes about a full year to cure since it's such a soft oil. I think once you learn the basic safety rules of lye, you're good to go. I was always afraid of working (c)
419 2018-01-29 23:05:38 You are against oil (Norways wealth) Car and truck manufacturing (Swedens wealth ) If you check most of the Scandinavian have had until recently centre right majority governments. They also have huge personal  tax in Sweden also now known as the rape capital of EU.Also NZ not US
420 2018-01-29 23:05:36 Cut my hair last week and this weather is making me wish I hadn’t. Castro and tea tree oil would do me wonders.
421 2018-01-29 23:05:29 Two part question.  Part one:  Can we show some footage to the Indy ticket guys cause that small section isn’t going to work?  Part two: Lucas oil streamer policy?
422 2018-01-29 23:05:28 imma continue using coco butter and coconut oil cuz that shit be having my skin glowing regardless
423 2018-01-29 23:05:18 If Trump colluded w/ Russia would it be logical to open up oil drilling everywhere, when Russia's #1 means of money is oil? Only Dems want to stop drilling & help Russia. This one wise man scoffed & said on Russia being a foe "The 1980's is calling for their foreign policy back."

425 2018-01-29 23:05:08 Rubbing sesame or coconut oil on our feet, ears, and even head at bedtime can go a long way towards physically relaxing our bodies. It may sound strange, but give it a try! It has an amazing, calming effect that #ayurveda recommends for improved #sleep.
426 2018-01-29 23:05:06 The dossier claimed that Igor Sechin, the owner of Rosneft (a Russian state-owned oil company), offered ‘brokerage’ to Page & Trump of 19% of Rosneft’s shares in exchange for Trump winning the presidency and lifting sanctions. On Dec. 7th, Rosneft sold 19.5% of its shares
427 2018-01-29 23:04:56 Was Indy a good spot for the WWF in the late 80s/early 90s? They got this match and a few years later WrestleMania. And why do you think they haven't went back even though there's Lucas Oil Stadium that's hosted Super Bowl & Final Fours?
428 2018-01-29 23:04:45 You misread my comment. I said harsh chemicals are not the ONLY solution. Most mouthwashes use alcohol, a harsh chemical, so coconut oil &aloe  provide another option as many have stated. gingivitis is a VERY big deal. stopping bleeding gums was amazing, my DDS is happy w results
429 2018-01-29 23:04:36 I'm not against any company being profitable.  LOL

I'm against NIMBY crony capitalists who will destroy my coastline while exempting their own. All while pretending it's for energy independence when the oil will be sold overseas.
430 2018-01-29 23:04:30 This means $100,000 plus oil field jobs for tens of thousands of hard working Americans.

Thank you @VP and @potus for making this possible.

431 2018-01-29 23:04:26 I am very, very slowly beginning to like oil painting. Only downside, the smell eventually makes me lightheaded. I can't have shit lmao
432 2018-01-29 23:04:25 Everything I know about oil I learned from the Oilers logo. Oil is orange, right?
433 2018-01-29 23:04:17 I dun fucked up.
I forgot to replace the oil cap on the engine.
Oil and smoke everywhere.

Fuck!

How did I fucking forget to do something so fucking basic?!

435 2018-01-29 23:03:53 The Scentsy oil I’m currently using smells just like the purple Powerade I lived on during high school. It’s taking all my willpower not to chug the oil like it’s lunch time senior year. 

#JoshAdams2020
436 2018-01-29 23:03:49 I fried homemade potato chips for dinner.

They were delicious.

Unfortunately, my entire house now smells of vegetable oil.

439 2018-01-29 23:03:42 I am for ending all subsidies. I keep looking for Oil subsidies and never find them…how much and what are they?
440 2018-01-29 23:03:29 Stop drinking things with caffeine &vitamin E oil xoxo
441 2018-01-29 23:03:19 To be honest, I pretty much live on Avo toast for work lunch. On bread stuffed with olives and mixed with chilli flakes and garlic oil. If I didn’t have that everyday I’d prob have a flat in Kensington by now right? 
442 2018-01-29 23:03:14 Why have these oil companies raised gas prices more than .25 cents in the last few weeks?

446 2018-01-29 23:02:55 Ugh I love it  I want to get the regular oil soon, I only have lavender in a roller bottle right now
447 2018-01-29 23:02:32 Looks like Trump's just circumventing the sanctions with the oil shipment arriving off the east coast wtf?
448 2018-01-29 23:02:26 We have several pipelines. They were good enough during the $100 oil boom so why are they not good enough now?
449 2018-01-29 23:02:18 I didn't say they're hurting, but let's put it in context- the margins for producing oil aren't as lucrative as they are in many other industries. Are you against any and all companies being profitable?

452 2018-01-29 23:01:55 No the Saudis and other Middle East groups where Harper's buddies, all that oil ya know. That is why the Saudi's now own our Canadian Wheat Board, Harper gave it to them, friends doing friends a favour.
453 2018-01-29 23:01:53 @BiodunFatoyinbo happy anniversary to you and your wife... More oil in your marriage walk of glory to glory..... I celebrate you sir/ma
454 2018-01-29 23:01:51 right - so he hasn't divided the country.  He didn't pass a tax bill that enriches all his billionaire and millionaire friends.

456 2018-01-29 23:01:35 @worldmarket I  the Blossom Hibiscus Roll On Perfume Oil but it is never available! Is it only a holiday item? I'm about to run out! 
457 2018-01-29 23:01:33 You should check the oil & not while the engine is hot...make sure it's in the safe range...also that the oil is clean/clear...if in doubt don't drive until you do this...
458 2018-01-29 23:01:17 Never. Now give me some thieves oil!
459 2018-01-29 23:00:52 
460 2018-01-29 23:00:40 My poor Meep Meep haven’t had a oil change since August 
461 2018-01-29 23:00:34 They squeak so they get the oil. Democrats should try it
462 2018-01-29 23:00:18 Been using it for years. If I mix it with moisturizer or emu oil my face doesn't get dry.
463 2018-01-29 23:00:16 if i meet a girl and her car tires bald and her engine oil is low she not the girl for me 
464 2018-01-29 23:00:13 yea, it doesn’t match well with my skin. I have very sensitive skin, it burns my face. and coconut oil I can’t use too much of either
465 2018-01-29 23:00:10 There’s an innocent story to be honest...my cat who now lives with my mum had a skin condition and his hair on his stomach thinned and fell out and his skin was sore so we had to massage in some treatment oil...and I saw them and was like WHAT ARE THOSEEEE
466 2018-01-29 23:00:00 A new kind of #cyberattack hit dozens of gas stations in southern Russia. It bypassed oil cyber security systems and the government. The attack "tricked" software at gas stations, resulting in customers receiving less fuel than what they paid for. The excess fuel was then resold.
467 2018-01-29 22:59:56 Go get some samples of @Kiehls. I use their toner, moisturizer, the night oil, BB cream, pretty much everything. I really love their stuff!
468 2018-01-29 22:59:55 What will they destroy? Will we see more oil spills? Environmental destruction, etc.?
469 2018-01-29 22:59:48 I’m a couple days late, but you have me reassessing my inventory! Does rose hip seed oil fall on any list... asking for a friend  and is there an oil in particular for dry skin... or cuticles?
470 2018-01-29 22:59:47 She had a lot more pull than her counterparts. Period. Sounds like you may know  details - but was discovered quickly that generic base acre program wasn't going to work well for cotton because loans were based on harvested crop. Seed and oil would give an ARC/PLC backup plan.
471 2018-01-29 22:59:28 I made a supreme pizza with coconut oil.
472 2018-01-29 22:59:27 Missile defense systems are snake oil. NEOhio will be turned to glass
473 2018-01-29 22:59:27 Oil and gas companies do contribute to climate change. We need to move to renewables and put #BigOil out of business!

475 2018-01-29 22:59:12 He put a 30% tax raise on solar energy crippling it even though it employs more Americans than coal and oil combined.
476 2018-01-29 22:59:10 So i decided to give it a try and put up some of my oil paintings for sale on Etsy.
477 2018-01-29 22:58:54 And look at oil, where we've clearly seen a geopolitical risk premium get priced in in late 2017.
478 2018-01-29 22:58:36 Think of it as an oil
479 2018-01-29 22:58:35 API tomorrow evening could show an even larger gasoline build, and crude build as well, then EIA could show the same thing on Wednesday morning, and oil could finally cascade down from there
480 2018-01-29 22:57:58 Why do roasted peanuts contain Palm Oil? We had roasted peanuts before we started putting Palm Oil in so many things. Watch Chris Packham's BBC program on the Orang Rimba to see the unnecessary impact.
481 2018-01-29 22:57:58 "For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:" ~Proverbs 5:3 #Bible
482 2018-01-29 22:57:57 Certainly the government has the highest profit margin when it comes to gasoline, but of course, oil companies profit. But let's point out they've also lost quite a bit in recent years as well.
483 2018-01-29 22:57:55 Yes, it was in part caused by the oil crash, however, the real reason can be traced to corruption and theft of the state's funds by the government with the intent of personal gain
484 2018-01-29 22:57:53 That said I'd rather just use coconut oil
485 2018-01-29 22:57:36 I love robotic oil poffins~!
486 2018-01-29 22:57:34 But but nobody knows more about oil than Donald Jackass Trump, believe me.
487 2018-01-29 22:57:24 Are they going to drill for oil in California or Texas?
488 2018-01-29 22:57:23 Not long at all, the engine needs oil to lubricate the barrens as they turn. If you ignore the light then you will be 2,000 dollars in damages or more. The light means it is below a safe level, you need to get it changed every 3,000 miles and the light won’t come on at 3,000.
489 2018-01-29 22:57:22 I love the environmental concern over Bitcoin mining. Burning fossil fuels? Billions of litres of oil spilled into the ocean? Mass deforestation and war? Nope. Bitcoin mining. Well whatever makes you care I guess.
490 2018-01-29 22:57:20 Between the ages of 14 and 17, the skin on my face was the fifth largest oil producing region in the Americas.
491 2018-01-29 22:57:05 Certainly some truth to this, but don't dismiss the power of diverse sources, for such a critical resource as oil.  If nations want access to diverse sources, they know they have to support the process of exportation, even if not ideally economical at any specific point in time.
492 2018-01-29 22:57:01 Time to take Hammy in for the first oil change and tire rotation. At least the first three service calls are free.
493 2018-01-29 22:56:35 Hopefully, they change the name back to the Oilers & throwback powder blue pants with the Derrick.   There's oil in Tennessee!! It's how the Clampetts made it to Beverly(ee)!

However, I've learned by now whenever @nike and uniform changes are mentioned together, fear the worst.
494 2018-01-29 22:56:24 Financial Times reports today that 'Brexit lift' comes from North Sea oil increased prices. Keep up.
495 2018-01-29 22:56:23 I bought coconut oil toilet roll from Tesco and it smells of coconut and my bathroom smells of coconut and I am very happy (cc @bookshaped).
496 2018-01-29 22:56:21 Had the gov't focused on education, and giving people means to produce their own food, etc.

From what I understand a lot of it was funded by your oil reserves, and the crash in the market definitely effected their ability to continue subsidizing etc.
497 2018-01-29 22:56:09 No, it was that it’s got so much oil or sugar according to the poster and the replies.
498 2018-01-29 22:56:09 And I ain't defending glucose (or corn syrup). It's just that in the early going, Lustig had me hyper-vigilant about fructose in corn syrup, so I assumed it was in corn chips and had to understand why it wasn't. Little did I know at the time about the soybean oil they're fried in
499 2018-01-29 22:55:51 Snake oil is still snake oil, its not i the spirit of cypher punks to sell a turd as gold
500 2018-01-29 22:55:41 When Randall said “I wake up every morning to the smell of coconut oil and a headscarf. I’m married to a black queen.” I felt that.
501 2018-01-29 22:55:25 Why is getting your oil changed and tires rotated such a chore?
502 2018-01-29 22:55:24 Your electric dreams
Power your lifeless battery
As screens flicker and fade
Cracked crystals
Swirling like oil
On a tumultuous gutter
Digital rain falling
On an analogue street

507 2018-01-29 22:54:48 Federal Reserve should reduce interest rates in order to allow the economy to expand and grow!!!With OIL PRICES creeping higher the rate hike would be an added tax on consumers and investors, defeating the tax cut plan...

509 2018-01-29 22:54:36 @ChrisGPackham  as a reward for doing my tax return settled down with @BBCiPlayer to watch your lost girl in Sumatra prog. Fabulous. Totally engrossed and so sad. What can we do to stop consuming palm oil?

516 2018-01-29 22:53:43 Nah, Ezra is just a He's never really worked a day in his life, just runs his mouth. The folks in the oil patch work hard for a living.
517 2018-01-29 22:53:40 LOOKS SO GOOD OMGGG. tbh tho, when it comes to tofu scramble I don't even use oil... I stir fry in water.

519 2018-01-29 22:53:14 That’s just another down payment on their next oil spill they can’t clean up
520 2018-01-29 22:53:06 @federalreserve @realDonaldTrump also your weaker currency makes it more expensive to import goods such as oil diamonds cars etc a stronger dollar makes it easier to buy these things as well as keeps all our allies safer from terrorism
521 2018-01-29 22:53:02 Truly Motley! Ordway and Callahan look like oil delivery men
522 2018-01-29 22:52:47 I'm sorry but if you can't do your own oil change. We can't date.

525 2018-01-29 22:52:35 They are transacting on $. So surely GOR is irrelevant. I know system is a mess but nobody ready for gold/oil standard yet methinks.
526 2018-01-29 22:52:21 Coconut Oil will do wonders and it has other health benefits too
527 2018-01-29 22:52:17 Removing the palm oil'd be an improvement, too.
528 2018-01-29 22:52:12 well lets see. country is moving towards electric vehicles and they are in the oil and gas business. details are important.
529 2018-01-29 22:51:57 Lmao I used to use oil sheen.
530 2018-01-29 22:51:56 Maybe oil Grady time? Cheaper... i know it aint the same tho
531 2018-01-29 22:51:49 Atrocities seem to be socially acceptable as long as they make a profit.

Epidemic deforestation? Sure, no problem. People gotta have cheap chocolate/sweets/everything else Palm Oil is in.

Slavery? No problem, people love their modern electronics as cheap as possible.
532 2018-01-29 22:51:43 Fine, if it doesn't bother you, kindly refrain from arguing about our right to self-determination.
God help folks like you when we leave - you'll suddenly understand what impact oil has had all along - but you won't be taking the lions share any more. Good luck with that.
533 2018-01-29 22:51:41 It is that black and white. City have won the League only twice since they came into oil money. Once more than Leicester. We, as a club, climb the hill in our own way. Always have. If you (not you specifically) don't know that, you need to find another club. It's that simple.
534 2018-01-29 22:51:41 Fasting to make up days when I was sick during Ramadan and migraine do not mix well. Can’t believe I forgot to add salt, pepper & olive oil to the portobello mushrooms 
535 2018-01-29 22:51:34 Yeah! I only use them if it has an attachment for real wax and not the oil cartridge
536 2018-01-29 22:51:25 is mine oil on water b r o k e

539 2018-01-29 22:50:48 Never mind the non Brexit related externalities that cannot be factored in as they are by their nature unknown as of yet. Iran bombing Saudi oil fields would make a huge difference for example.

544 2018-01-29 22:50:04 Comforting thought of the day RT @sarazarrbooks: Fun fact: Raymond Chandler was 51 when he broke out with The Big Sleep. Before the depression he was an oil company exec. I know it can seem like every writer is like 28, but they aren’t, and it’s not too late for you.
545 2018-01-29 22:49:55 drilling is only bad because oil causes pollution

more housing units in urban neighborhoods in mild climates actually reduces pollution because it cuts demand for oil (so it's actually the opposite of Drill, Baby, Drill)

553 2018-01-29 22:49:05 I know this sounds goofy, probably is but, back in the day when lead was used in everything from house paints, water pipes and octane boost in gasoline caused significant health/intellectual issues. Working the toxic enviro in the oil patch may have similar results, just saying

555 2018-01-29 22:48:49 They just tried to hit me with a claim for $2228 for “damages”. Saying we spilled wine, blood was everywhere, we smoked inside, got oil on all of their beds sets, carpet was dirty. 

All of it just a lie with pictures. It’s too much detail to go into.
556 2018-01-29 22:48:47 Well. Of course he does. He’s never worked on an oil rig. Actually, he’s never worked in the way the rest of us understand work. Why would you expect him to care?
557 2018-01-29 22:48:27 You must get all that vast intelligence from cnn?  You meant to say former ceo of Exxon and former ceo of a bank not all the corrupt bankers and oil managers correct?  How about Timothy Geithner, Peter orszag and Jack Lew? That’s right obama was your god he didn’t count?
558 2018-01-29 22:48:26 I've heard coconut oil is made of chemicals.

569 2018-01-29 22:46:01 That’s why we need to get off as much oil as possible so we don’t have to keep meddling in these countries. It’s costing us tons of money and lives & clearly we’re no safer then before 9/11. All of it was a waste.
570 2018-01-29 22:46:00 Bad thing about that Wild Rose, some of the oil leaked out and as much as I cleaned the bottle, I'm being assaulted by heavy rose smell. I'm not really fond of rose scents

574 2018-01-29 22:45:02 Wow now I’m feeling put on the spot  I don’t use a particular brand but things like coconut oil, conditioner, shea butter, then eyebrow pencils.
575 2018-01-29 22:44:56 Man, I loved when, in his infinite wisdom, George W. Bush caused the stock markets and global oil markets to collapse so I could fill my tank up for under $20 for a few months.

601 2018-01-29 22:42:24 Impressed with his audacity but I got worried with the amount of debt and risk he was willing to take on. Maybe he felt oil would continue to sell at a high rate or maybe he had reserves somewhere we don't know about

609 2018-01-29 22:41:30 I think they are investing because you freed up a lot of government/peoples land for them to rape and pillage oil and gas.

611 2018-01-29 22:41:25 I guess I understand that… but why should I pay more at the pump so that we can export oil?  Couldn’t we use it here to lower $ at the pump?

638 2018-01-29 22:38:26 You should be using a face wash that takes the excess oil out of your skin and then bringing back moisture to your face with the moisturizers, so it'll be moist and not oily, you should still be able to see the moisture on your skin
639 2018-01-29 22:38:22 We do not need any more ExxonMobil unless they are flipping to the CLEAN ENERGY platform. Oil is outdated, unnecessary and pollutes us & the planet. We are aware the clean energy technologies not only exist but are in use. Come clean.

If Iran moved against us in first two, we'd hit them hard; re: number 3 don't walk away from JCPOA. Israel can take care of business.
658 2018-01-29 22:36:02 That $50 Billion will be offset by the billions of dollars needed to treat victims of fossil-fuel pollution, repair infrastructure and water sources due to fracking earthquakes and other damage, and endless cleanup of pipeline oil sludge spills.

663 2018-01-29 22:35:25 What did you correct? Seems to me like you still don't get the point. You don't seem to understand my first tweet wasn't serious. The point is just because something is natural doesn't mean it's healthy.  All of the fats are naturally occurring even corn oil, soybean oil etc.

As we face an economic recession due to declines in oil revenue & state spending, it’s crucial to start developing these skills in the next generation of leaders.
692 2018-01-29 22:31:50 Virginia coastline should NOT be reopened to oil and gas drilling. Especially when the price of renewable energy is falling and becoming more cost effective.
693 2018-01-29 22:31:33 It’s coconut oil for my makeup 
694 2018-01-29 22:31:29 @KaraGMoriarty: This latest oil tax bill, HB 288, represents the 8th change in tax law in 13 years, 6 of which were tax increases. This is the very definition of instability. #akleg

702 2018-01-29 22:30:56 Ya I need to try it I use the Argan oil with coconut water bt I need to try that !
703 2018-01-29 22:30:54 Secretary of Oil Drilling Tillerson must be elated.
704 2018-01-29 22:30:46 OIL DIFF: 3.95 -> 4.0
705 2018-01-29 22:30:44 Start ruining our oceans and risking our environment for oil export profits. We don't need the oil. (you don't think they want all that oil for us do you?). They want it for export profits.
706 2018-01-29 22:30:35 "People are dying on the streets, kids with malnutrition and rickets."
SNP run Scotland, take it up with them
"What am not accepting is WM rule"
What you are not accepting is the result of a referendum - Scotland voted to stay in the UK.  Suck it up.
Oh, and the oil price HALVED
707 2018-01-29 22:30:25 Blepharitis- eye lid inflammation as a result of a Staph A infection; which can be exacerbated by: dehydration, cold weather, grieving for the dead, low humidity. Few drops of Tea tree oil in warm water - wipe once with a separate cotton wool ball in both directions
708 2018-01-29 22:30:02 Will affordable sexdolls be the final deathblow to the poorly educated. The guy is literally the epitome of snake oil salesman.
709 2018-01-29 22:29:50 ARU NO ACEPTA 18% DE REBAJA EN EL GAS OIL PARA EL 90% DE LOS PRODUCTORES, QUEDA BIEN CLARO QUE EL TRASFONDO DEL CAMPO

710 2018-01-29 22:29:45 Tune ups oil changes brakes
711 2018-01-29 22:29:44 Wonder why they are not going after the oil companies? We are being gouged. And they manipulate the pump prices.
712 2018-01-29 22:29:39 How about you don't  open up your lands for further drilling and oil exploration? Evidenced-based research shows a direct correlation.......
713 2018-01-29 22:29:37 Oil industry? #RFID is being used to automatically identify assets out in the field, in lay down yards, on rigs, & wherever there's oil.
714 2018-01-29 22:29:35 There was a smarmy comment about "different relationship with oil and gas"-yeah, like that between drug addict and pusher?
715 2018-01-29 22:29:25 No power in fairland reference number CPWEB2242401, been off now for more than 24 hours, just tell us how long does it take for oil to get to the technician who ordered it for a transformer?

719 2018-01-29 22:28:47 Huge sums are being invested in the North Sea as we tweet. Oil companies don't gamble they make money!
720 2018-01-29 22:28:46 Thank you! My cuticles are often still a mess (but I try to put oil on them to soften them as much as I can!) however to stop biting the nails I got extensions til my natural nails grew out, then got the extensions removed and just put heavy duty gel paint on!
721 2018-01-29 22:28:45 hey @hallsy09 I see through your "Hand" injury.. you're a good sport, Im sure DB enjoyed the All Star Game. Missing Yard sales in Oil country lol.
722 2018-01-29 22:28:40 Why I feel they wanted to Chop my guy Money was theres no way a State Company is bidding for a State asset + Global Oil Company and no one knows each other n other party can't find out lol ONE or EBN played Devils Advocate
723 2018-01-29 22:28:35 @Babygiwa he dodged a bullet 

But I still believe he would have made it float even with the dwindling oil price 

Angola and Guinea were his opting and Nigeria was a third.

724 2018-01-29 22:28:27 Sara Lofflin of LOGIC says "if a restaurant was violating health codes, a local government could shut them down. Why is oil and gas any different?" In support of "The Protect Act" #localcontrol #COpolitics
725 2018-01-29 22:28:18 And you think western countries have done anything less? US and UK have waged war on several eastern countries for oil, minerals and power. Not like the West actually cares.
726 2018-01-29 22:28:04 Remind me to give you some coconut oil next time I see you 
727 2018-01-29 22:28:04 We have our own oil project up here in the real Vancouver that's going ahead despite objections of municipalities involved.

729 2018-01-29 22:28:01 I've only skimmed around while juggling kids, but it doesn't even seem to really have a thesis. It's just, "here's a bunch of stuff I did."

It's just really depressing. This must be how medical doctors feel when they see quacks making millions selling snake oil on Oprah.
730 2018-01-29 22:27:41 Not to toot my own horn, but Standard oil is the only actual oil industry out there. Money buys you everything  #Monopoly
731 2018-01-29 22:27:34 @KaraGMoriarty: .@EIAgov says total U.S. oil production will grow to 10 or 11 million barrels per day. Big question: What role will Alaska play in that growth given our huge, well known oil and gas resources? Depends on policy, investment, competition. #akleg
732 2018-01-29 22:27:19 #NoOilDrilling #ProtectOurCoasts Freedom from oil is vital to save our planet. We need energy independence using renewable resources. We deserve protections from pollution and poisons. It is our patriotic duty to preserve our country’s natural beauty.

City using Oil money of owners
734 2018-01-29 22:27:15 @GordonAplin I thunk that last word might have been 'oil'
735 2018-01-29 22:27:14 If you honestly look at the numbers Canada is nothing to u.s economy with no immediate need of Canadian oil or water, everything else is irrelevant, Canada needs access to u.s markets #pnpcbc
736 2018-01-29 22:27:12 Oil is picking up...... time to invest
737 2018-01-29 22:27:09 Are they going to be researching and developing green energy? Oil & gas won't mean shit in the future if earth is uninhabitable. Oh, and thanks Exxon for holding that money out of the U.S. Until you got a better deal. Fuck the rest who can't, amirite?
738 2018-01-29 22:26:57 Numbers and I are like oil and water -- we don't mix. I'm a word nerd myself. :^)
739 2018-01-29 22:26:52 Trump is killing our Solar industry. Not implementing Russian sanctions. We are buying natural gas from Russia. It already violates sanctions. He's opening shores up for drilling and pollution. Oil oligarchs finance R Cabal. Tillerson ExxonMobil shill/friend of Russia
740 2018-01-29 22:26:48 No power in fairland reference number CPWEB2242401, been off now for more than 24 hours, apparently technicians need some oil for the transformer... All I'm told is that they placed an order? 
And now I will most prob get apologies for the inconvenience again...
741 2018-01-29 22:26:46 I don’t use an oil based cleanser, it’s more of a light gel..would I have to use a toner then? #IrishBeautyHour
742 2018-01-29 22:26:39 Has anyone used Vitamin E oil on their face? How and when do you use it? Benefits? Issues?
743 2018-01-29 22:26:37 this just in: palm oil destroys forests n animal habitats increasing global warming 
744 2018-01-29 22:26:35 What am not accepting is WM rule. You should go on YouTube where experts saying we were LIED to since oil was found and they have been lying ever since. People are dying on the streets, kids with malnutrition and rickets.
745 2018-01-29 22:26:11 Not to mention subsidies to oil as well as the massive military budget.
746 2018-01-29 22:25:46 So in the kitchen making #momsspaghetti and i relize i have no strainer! Well thanks to getting high and frying chicken with my brother we drained the dirty oil and melted the mf. We simple
747 2018-01-29 22:25:43 Sure they did, Trump promised them to ruin all our coast lines with oil rigs with the exception of Florida I wonder why. Piece of trash!
748 2018-01-29 22:25:32 I’ve already got the runs after drinking all that oil.....
749 2018-01-29 22:25:17 Absolutely my pleasure, Maria! What an amazing accomplishment this luxury oil is! xoxox
750 2018-01-29 22:25:08 I use rapeseed oil. I thought it was a healthy option?
751 2018-01-29 22:25:05 What if oil prices drop? The oil minister changes? Some1 passes a random bill that makes your original modelling wrong? You/Ur daddy annoys the wrong person? Militants? These deals are extremely high risk and for the inexperienced, usually destined for AMCON. Bitter truth
752 2018-01-29 22:25:05 The whole of Westminster needs kicked out!,over 40 years they have near bankrupted an oil rich UK,not that you would know thanks to the billionaire owned compliant media and the state broadcaster,never hear corruption or bankrupt in media ever,yet here we are
753 2018-01-29 22:24:57 Agreed! They make the best fish and some of the best olive oil around. People are also super friendly. 
754 2018-01-29 22:24:43 It's all about oil money SS.
755 2018-01-29 22:24:41 Which is a really depressing thought and also what was suggested to me by a peak oil scientist who spoke to us and has haunted me ever since. I don't want it to be true. He was going further, suggesting peak oil would eventually put us in Fallout type conditions
756 2018-01-29 22:24:40 Arizona is awful, constantly having to protect my wagon from Apaches whenever I need to go into town to buy snake oil, sick of it
757 2018-01-29 22:24:38 Thanks to the opening of US coastal waters to drilling. Which will put gobs of $$ into Exxon Mobil’s coffers and probably gobs of oil into the ocean 
758 2018-01-29 22:24:37 Girl I just started rubbing a drop of pure castor oil on my face while I’m in the shower and then using either tea tree oil or apple cider vinegar for problem areas and it’s worked wonders
759 2018-01-29 22:24:34 I have been waiting for XLE to lead oil down. So took small profits ERY and doubled down DWT, which I am down a bit on
760 2018-01-29 22:24:27 If I'm ever contemplating using oil pastels for an art piece in the future, stop me. Whatever it takes, stop me for my own good.

767 2018-01-29 22:23:25 @KaraGMoriarty: Oil revenues are predicted to provide 75% of the state's unrestricted general funds (or spending money) in FY18. Over $2.4 billion in revenues to state and local communities, all in. #akleg

770 2018-01-29 22:22:56 oil has been going straight up in the last 2 weeks, as opposed to other related names that have been flat-to-down, so you're probably right to short the thing that's highest up
771 2018-01-29 22:22:56 You CAN have chocolate, just try to make sure it’s the high cacao content varieties if you get a chocolate bar. There’s also a paleo fudge recipe that is pretty good, only 3 ingredients cacao, coconut oil and honey
772 2018-01-29 22:22:39 The oil can empty

778 2018-01-29 22:21:14 I hate to sound negative, but I think the answer is no.

Could even very large companies operating at state and regional level stop the Standard Oil Company? They could not.

817 2018-01-29 22:16:25 You might consider easing up on the oil drilling.
818 2018-01-29 22:16:21 oil change was free today. 
819 2018-01-29 22:15:33 I also suspected that we were there already. Of all things, the weekly numbers may be underestimating production. The market will get slapped in the face when we get revisions. BUT my "feelings only" prediction on weekly numbers says next week sees 10+ million :)
820 2018-01-29 22:15:29 Did one thing today about 30 min before close. Took small gains on ERY and doubled down on DWT. More value in short oil after today than short XLE IMO.
821 2018-01-29 22:15:27 sliced carrots friend in coconut oil? i have to go to the grocery store, something i don't like to do so i wait until the very last minute. i think that time is now.
822 2018-01-29 22:15:15 This is sick. They are public lands. And you are handing them to your oil and coal buddies to line your own pockets.

825 2018-01-29 22:14:58 @KaraGMoriarty: Oil production is up for the second year in a row. New oil came from both existing and new oil fields. #akleg
826 2018-01-29 22:14:56 Perhaps a stretch of ‘previously announced’ — they’ve announced big billions on tight oil thru 2020. now they just have a # for 2020-22 too?
827 2018-01-29 22:14:54 That gotta be the quickest i ever got an oil change

834 2018-01-29 22:14:04 Very important info on t rumps scheme to appoint unknown regulators or de regulators. Keeping secret the impact of Pruitt, who’s associated with oil and gas, as head of epa. Pruit has sued epa in past more than once and heading the agency is a conflict of interest.
835 2018-01-29 22:13:59 You're talking to a die hard Tribe fan here. I could care less. It's just a mascot. They've been phasing him out for years. It was just a matter of time. They're still my team regardless of a Block-C logo or Wahoo.

847 2018-01-29 22:13:00 Use nair to remove peach fuzz. Then gently cleanse & apply aloe vera & tea tree oil. It reduces the redness from the nair!
848 2018-01-29 22:12:56 Oh really??! I had no idea olive oil helped boost immunity 
849 2018-01-29 22:12:31 I’ve gone with snake oil 
850 2018-01-29 22:12:29 Whisk egg yolk with a tablespoon of olive oil and leave on hair for a few minutes before your shampoo. It makes a great hair conditioner.
851 2018-01-29 22:12:28 If my skin could stop producing a ton of oil everyday that would be great 
852 2018-01-29 22:12:26 witch hazel I use, African black soap dries my skin OUT, coconut oil I use  I need a good cleanser, because the African soap doesn’t work
853 2018-01-29 22:12:08 They don't find it unprofitable! NO company would be opening new fields of oil if it wasn't profitable! That isn't how they work!
854 2018-01-29 22:12:08 Yeah all brush. Would usually go for oil but I’ll see how it dries. Lovely colours and goes on well.
855 2018-01-29 22:12:01 Oil pulling gets easier with time I've found. 20 minutes is actually easy.
856 2018-01-29 22:11:55 I thinking comparing it to the IRA blowing up Londoners is preposterous. We are talking about canvas, pigment & oil as opposed to things like men being able to legally rape their wives etc. Women not having the vote involved real suffering endured with no power to change it....
857 2018-01-29 22:11:29 Feyi. Maybe you don’t understand the strategy. He must have said it 10 times, Africa  was the opportunity. And funding for Oil and Gas is always there.
858 2018-01-29 22:11:22 To my black brothers & sisters Obama & Clinton overthrew & killed Ghadfi N Lybia because he didn't want HIS countries oil sold in U.S. $ Now our African brothers & sisters R being sold into slavery How N the HELL can U support that? @barackobama @hillaryclinton #WAKETF**KUP
859 2018-01-29 22:11:08 Our gasoline and fuel oil is the highest its been in over 4 years. Why the spike? Why is America buying natural gas from Russia? Now it's easy to see why Trump just tried to kill SOLAR. Holy Geezus people. We. Are. In. Trouble.

865 2018-01-29 22:10:14 The truth is that the rich are subsidized. Oil companies couldn't survive without government assistance. The Fed Reserve gives free money to bankers, hedge funds, and stock investors. Those lucky enough to be born into certain ZIP codes get better schools.

879 2018-01-29 22:08:29 @MannyMua733 I saw you had a cold on snap, drink some hot mint tea with a little lemon & orange essential oil in it & you’ll feel great. Sweeten with raw honey to help as well & you can add a drop of peppermint oil to really clear your sinuses. You’ll be able to smell EVERYTHING
880 2018-01-29 22:08:21 It also incentivizes alternative energy production because you can save money by skipping on the carbon tax.

A big reason why the price of solar power generation started aggressively trending down since 2008 was because oil (and later coal) prices were super high, for example.
881 2018-01-29 22:07:59 Men, you oil and gas people are amazing.
882 2018-01-29 22:07:58 Me n my idiot ass left my moisturiser at home and I can tell you coconut oil does moisturise well at all do not believe the lies!!!
883 2018-01-29 22:07:57 The American people would rather have clean energy.  Not oil.  Will they invest in that?
884 2018-01-29 22:07:56 Unrelated to any topic on Twitter today: I keep wondering how much longer before the essential oil craze is over.
885 2018-01-29 22:07:51 I wish that was the case when my "low on motor oil" LED started blinking. Sometime I really want to just sit down and chill with my engine. Like in the old times, you know.

887 2018-01-29 22:07:40 Bros, this was in 2014. Oil prices were already doing laidis laidat. Where would that money have come from? Even the state backed guys who bought it abandoned it after a couple of years. God saved him. Or maybe God saved Nigeria

Guess he doesn't know what happens next? Bacon is loaded w/addictive salt & fat/oil. Blood Pressure goes up!!

957 2018-01-29 21:59:38 The hypocrisy of it all.  Oil companies get fined by epa for every creature that may have died from a suspected leak.  While there is actual language that allows for the killing of birds via wind turbine.  Things that make ya say hmmmm……

975 2018-01-29 21:57:40 Nah. Trump followers won't accept that they follow a snake oil salesman and soon to be traitor. To them Trump's business interests are more important than America. His treason? He's willing to give the Russians state secrets for hotel financing.
976 2018-01-29 21:57:35 TIC we did an experiment on air pollution we had one cup of water we covered the cup with a paper towel we added oil,pepper,soap and then we uncovered it and lots of people got different kinds of water my team got a really dark color.#experiment

979 2018-01-29 21:57:09 HOW TO YOU CLAIM THE KKK CROSS & LOVE THE NOT WHITE MAN ON AN OIL PAINTING..LOL
980 2018-01-29 21:57:06 Do you have any extra product in stock that we could pick up today or tomorrow. I'm having a flare Lupus and I would really like to see if the oil will help.

984 2018-01-29 21:56:51 Get some coconut oil on whatever it is. Natural antibacterial and moisturiser in one! X
985 2018-01-29 21:56:36 I’d get Murphy Oil Soap and a wet rag, wipe up the mess. 
Better than negotiating with a bug.

992 2018-01-29 21:55:36 Probably not the intent, but does point out compromises made for cost and shelf life. I loved Nutella as a teenager, but less so as an adult.  Would probably prefer cocoa butter over palm oil, whole milk over skim milk powder, way more cocoa, less sugar, more salt, add almonds.

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
995 2018-01-29 21:54:52 With a 30% tariff on solar panels? With our deals with the Saudis (who are running out of oil)? Dow is all-time high with dollar at 10-yr low, unemployment was under 5 when he took office, deregulation is BAD for humans. If you only care about money, I hope you have some.

1001 2018-01-29 21:53:51 Aye coz you are an oil painting yerself ya fanny
1002 2018-01-29 21:53:40 That tariff was a pretentious ruse intended to blast a huge hole - to knock the legs out from under a booming US solar industry in favor of oil, coal & gas. Big wet kiss to Big Oil & dirty fossil fuel industry. He knows - like everyone else does - it's not going to "create jobs".
1003 2018-01-29 21:53:20 The pattern is very discerning.  Listening to his podcasts, he gives crypto crap for being the medium of "drug dealers, terrorists, and other nasty people" and best to stay away. But in the same breath, admits that Iran/NK/Russia/China use gold to settle payments for oil and 1/2

we borrow the extra one
when we say "oil."
1009 2018-01-29 21:51:24 Nope. The deal was worth $1 plus 300M by Advisors, the cost of the abandonement for Netherlands. $50M extra is nothing in Oil and Gas. His funding was international.

1014 2018-01-29 21:50:52 Too bad about that climate change thing. We will drown in oil while the rest of the world changes to renewables.
1015 2018-01-29 21:50:30 For all the engineers and others who work for them of course. Ideal jobs for those ex oil/gas engineers who've been made redundant. You may be interested to know that motorsport engineering is worth £8bn a year to the UK so yes, I'm for real,
1016 2018-01-29 21:50:30 Nothing screams “IDK HOW TO ADULT” more than sending pics to your mom of a tax form so she can help you fill it out. Why don’t they teach useful things in school....like how to do this... and how to check your oil on your car.
1017 2018-01-29 21:50:13 I think the $6 grapeseed oil has been doing great things for my dry ass skin
1018 2018-01-29 21:50:02 Oils time has gone?! Are you really that naïve ? Almost every product used today either uses oil to create it or has oil in it. Plastics, autos, machinery to create these products.... Oil isn’t going anywhere
1019 2018-01-29 21:49:51 Wow. You REALLY drank the kookaid. Oil price rising benefits Trump/Russia. Yes, I saw the videos. They boo him. They protest him even coming to their countries. He's been uninvited. An embarrassment. Huge layoffs. Job growth 17 was lowest since 2010! Pull your head out.
1020 2018-01-29 21:49:50 Try “Whale Oil Beef Hooked”

Instead of investing in a future where there is life on this planet, you go for the instant gratification of money in your pocket. 

We don't need more drilling or oil. #BeverleyHillbilly
1025 2018-01-29 21:49:01 No.. We are buying fuel oil. We have actual Russian military ships flanking the coasts. Had em last summer too. Just on the International Water line.

1028 2018-01-29 21:48:51 mostly we want the T. Let's be honest. I wanna know if I need to drop coint on these balms and nonsense or if I'm good with some coconut oil and blush.

1035 2018-01-29 21:48:19 @PressSec You want us to put Russia probe to sleep, has your boss signed the Russia sanctions? You see the tankers of oil on the east coast Maryland. Apparently, he still kissing Putin's behind! @tedlieu @SenJeffMerkley @SenWarren @SenSanders @GOP @SenateDems @TheDemocrats

1037 2018-01-29 21:47:57 @michelleinbklyn SO terible for the Palestinians. Where would they live better in the ME? Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Libya, Iraq. Only oil producing countries. Everywhere else they would be worse off.
1038 2018-01-29 21:47:51 Not hyperbole. trump eliminated the anti-corruption rule requiring oil/gas companies to disclose payments to foreign governments. Hmmm...wonder why? When Tillerson was CEO of Exxon he also wanted to remove the rules under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and CPA.
1039 2018-01-29 21:47:47 Effort ah.

Why won't they give a simple yes or no answer?
1050 2018-01-29 21:46:18 Yeah ... they want to DRILL OIL OFF THE AMERICAN COASTLINE, DUHHHH .... SERIOUSLY .... THIS IS DISGUSTING

1056 2018-01-29 21:45:41 By drilling in the Artic and National Parks? Louisiana is in a recession and has high unemployment greatly due to the price of oil dropping. Becoming dependant on 1 industry is hazardous to our economy. International tourism has dropped since Trump was elected losing mil $ & jobs
1057 2018-01-29 21:45:22 I no discredit am o. Me wey I no get money. But I like the story. It helps to show how ‘oil and gas’ is done in Nigeria. I mean, the guy was bored and unemployed and decided to buy a chevron asset 
1058 2018-01-29 21:45:22 Sure... I had a steady high paid job always, never unemployed since 93... Oil n gas... In 2013 it died..  I was unemployed for the first time in my life... Then got a shit salary in November last year finally a high paying job again.
 Of course the market started showing signs

1071 2018-01-29 21:43:51 Have you ever received funding from an oil company? A yes or no will do here. 

No need to obfuscate. Or maybe there is.

Have you ever received funding from an oil company? Yes or no?

1073 2018-01-29 21:43:28 Go in for an oil change come out paying $300 for a needed tune up 
1074 2018-01-29 21:43:15 And a cup of oil too I imagine
1075 2018-01-29 21:42:52 - meaning that when the price of oil crashed, the government subsidised the losses. Since the scale of nationalisation was so wide, the government was forced into a period of heavy austerity. The ironic part is that socialism destroyed its own socialist principles.
1076 2018-01-29 21:42:49 Presently the S.E depends of FGN to pay salaries from oil rev, what type of structure are you proposing that will make S.E viable in say, next 4yrs.
Specifics only, nothing nebulous pls.
1077 2018-01-29 21:42:49 Pizza rolls— get pillsbury crust and cut it into rectangles. Roll it up with pepp and a cheese stick. Brush with garlic butter or olive oil or WHATEVER. Bake for like 15ish mins. After that they’re super easy to microwave and you can bring a Tupperware of marinara
1078 2018-01-29 21:42:46 Well ya have to admit, Obama killed more jobs than he so called created! He killed coal, oil drilling and the pipeline. So no he didnt
1079 2018-01-29 21:42:45 It depends what you want. I think those two moisturizers I have are amazing but the marula oil and their nighttime exfoliant treatment ain’t worth it. People really like their jelly cleanser but the glossier one does the same thing and it’s cheaper so just depends
1080 2018-01-29 21:42:43 Im over here in a fancy Ralph Lauren outfit and my dad is all like “let’s  check the oil and fluids in your car”.

1083 2018-01-29 21:42:37 Now you're talking! 
Scary the number of people who don't regularly check their cars oil/water/tyre pressures. Even scarier the number of them who haven't a clue how to! #motorhour
1084 2018-01-29 21:42:30 so does olive oil
1085 2018-01-29 21:42:26 That you've spent a boat a lot of dodgy oil money? Are you always this dense
1086 2018-01-29 21:42:17 It's a distraction Matthew. The Russian sanctions are due today. He wants to distract from the fact that a Russian tanker is or was unloading oil of the East coast which violates the sanctions.

1094 2018-01-29 21:41:15 I haven't tried that method, but I do bake it via the Minimalist Baker method--which is just cubing it and baking it with nothing more than salt. I love it this way--have eaten as a snack. But will try the oil/soy sauce method now!
1095 2018-01-29 21:41:13 It's all about the oil and gas pipelines. Europe is thirsty and doesn't want to bother Turkey. And it's also about the weapons trade: Big buyers get the final say. World leaders are not leaders. They're businessmen with no heart and soul.

1100 2018-01-29 21:40:49 What winning?!? You people keep talking about winning...oil prices are rising fast, dollar value is plummeting, growth slowed in 4th qtr, massive layoffs, jobs numbers slowing, worldwide and allies despise us, mass shootings up, crime up. He hasn't done sht.
1101 2018-01-29 21:40:44 The most important issue facing our world today is climate change. We should be figuring out how to cease our relationship with oil... not be proud we are further invested/entrenched. #ignorant

1112 2018-01-29 21:39:31 We know were you smeared that olive oil
1113 2018-01-29 21:39:26 Oil? It's 2018 not 1986..
1114 2018-01-29 21:39:15 Or a well machined oil.
1115 2018-01-29 21:38:50 Trust me the amount of cars we pick up with bald tyres cracked screens and no oil in them  #usedandabused #motorhour
1116 2018-01-29 21:38:41 Well, what I was suggesting was that is it possible that softer LLS prices means that refineries are already starting turnaround, meaning they have less demand for gulf coast crude oil.  Not a fact....just a suggestion...
1117 2018-01-29 21:38:29 How are flaxseed & hemp oil unhealthy, though (esp. when consumed cold)? And palm oil is linked to heart disease IIRC.

1120 2018-01-29 21:38:08 That's just Turkey. Then you should figure out how Iraq and Syria will react to a minority breaking away with 1/4 of their country, with majority of the water and oil. Basically meaning leaving a majority of both countries poor, thirsty and ultimately hungry.

1142 2018-01-29 21:34:43 I think it could work, too. Just have to figure out how to convince them to stop refilling the ranks of PKK. Maybe if they were told that they CANNOT have their new State with lots of oil unless PKK is ended by them first. Would need a coalition of some kind to observe this.
1143 2018-01-29 21:34:41 Er,  I thought they were dependent on oil,  or was he havering?

1145 2018-01-29 21:34:11 Just kidding.  Oil complex is a system.
1146 2018-01-29 21:34:09 Not yet, just dumped half a quart of oil
1147 2018-01-29 21:34:06 This is such a good way of getting oil I have no idea how you haven't heard about this. You should tame a phiomia and feed it stim berries to get an unlimited supply of poo. The heavier the weight of the dung beetle the more oil it makes so definitely get the highest level one.
1148 2018-01-29 21:34:06 Yea but you gotta also look at who’s been running the economy. Majority presidents since the 70s have been republicans . And what are most republicans invested in or owners of? Oil rigs . So they not doing that

1167 2018-01-29 21:32:18 There is a REALLY good tactic to get a constant supply of oil. You tame dung beetles and they are super efficent. You tame them passively, by meat or even poo. Leave them on wonder with poo in their inventory and they make oil and fertiliser.
1168 2018-01-29 21:32:16 There's a reason why gas prices keep rising at the pump.... the oil industry is selling it overseas and making huge profits while bleeding our reserves dry.  And now you want foreign drillers destroying our coasts.

1171 2018-01-29 21:31:59 It will probably be the modest rise in rates that puts the dagger in the economy/market's heart. Sort of like $140 oil did in 2008 but far less dramatic.
1172 2018-01-29 21:31:43 Per amount of energy that is produced the production of solar panels actually produces more pollutants then oil.

1) you had NO IDEA that Saudi's controlled our biggest refinery
2) you had NO IDEA the oil to be piped across American farms belongs to Canada
3) you have no idea that the Canadian oil, refined by the Saudis is being shipped abroad.

1247 2018-01-29 21:22:01 some more Gerin Oil and 2 tabs of Pentazemin
1248 2018-01-29 21:21:56 Have you considered the possibility that people who work in the Big Oil industry aren't just mustache twirling villains who just like to dump garbage on brown people for no personal gain, just purely for how evil it is?
1249 2018-01-29 21:21:53 Great news for Secretary Tillerson and Russian oil interests that invest in Exxon
1250 2018-01-29 21:21:39 Get a couple essential oil diffusers, and frankincense and lavender oils. Blast that shit at night for about an hour before bed. 
1251 2018-01-29 21:21:32 Try dr bronners baby formula body wash, its all natural and removes the excess oil really well
1252 2018-01-29 21:21:30 for the chest i usually cleanse my body with pure castile soap, none of that scented shit. exfoliate the area and i drink lots of water. i mositurize with vitamin e oil or jojoba oil and i sometimes get blemishes there as well so i apply tea tree oil. i hope this helps!!
1253 2018-01-29 21:21:26 I just got the oil last week so the novelty hasn't worn off and I'm definitely using too much every day but I'm so obsessed! I can't stop!!!
1254 2018-01-29 21:21:10 #Tillerson & #Exxonknew. They hid their own scientific data proving that those ice caps would melt. Imagine waiting 40+ yrs for them to melt, contract w/ #Putin 640,000,000 acres to drill oil in Russia & sanctions crushed the greedy bastards dreams. @Exxon_Knew #oil #TrumpRussia
1255 2018-01-29 21:21:03 Actually thats when retail beats the oil industry
1256 2018-01-29 21:21:00 So weird. I can only imagine she was like “ew all that sugar!!” But she didn’t specify so who knows. Just posted re: palm oil bc that’s a legit concern for sure!
1257 2018-01-29 21:20:36 You criminals stole OUR Tax that should go towards healthcare education infrastructure &
We the People not billionaire criminals out to monopolize control & destroy Americas water air & resources.
Coal & oil companies need to be abolished
They are obsolete
1258 2018-01-29 21:20:33 It controls and moisturizes with sunflower oil. Smells amazing. Very peppery and smooth.
1259 2018-01-29 21:20:20 Who fucking reads the bible when they are getting their oil changed?!
1260 2018-01-29 21:20:18 In a drugged haze, Marco Rubio admits to President Trump that Russian oil executives are utterly useless. Rush Limbaugh starts over.
1261 2018-01-29 21:20:13 Remember to contact your legislators and tell them you support the legalization of Cannabis! #mmj #cannabis #cbd #hemp #oil #legalizeit #medicinalmarijuana
1262 2018-01-29 21:20:12 The private sector is actually exactly responsible for creating these warships. Who else would make them? And it's effect across the country keeps many small towns alive. And the oil to fuel this industry is defended by our military monopoly of oil production. #PetroDollar
1263 2018-01-29 21:20:04 @GraceandFrankie thought me about palm oil 
1264 2018-01-29 21:20:00 John West Tuna, in Sunflower oil, Bryn and Spring water #NationalPuzzleDay
1265 2018-01-29 21:20:00 Because the EPA is rolling back all those regulations on things like, oh I don't know, oil spills, worker safety, etcetera.  Of course they're going to come back!
1266 2018-01-29 21:19:50 I'M OBSESSED!!! It smells a bit like lemon drops, and works really well. I started with their "Stubble Cream" because it was cheaper but I should have just done the oil because I don't like the stubble cream.
1267 2018-01-29 21:19:47  Very interesting Q’s. I’ve been oil painting today & the sculpture aspect is fascinating...
I’ll be thinking these over tonight! 
1268 2018-01-29 21:19:44 No one gives a sh*t about oil. Renewable energy is our future. Saudi Arabia even  knows that. They are stock piling oil because most expects agree that by 2050 most oil reserves will be depleted.
1269 2018-01-29 21:19:43 The palm oil concern I get (I’m not a fan of the environmental effects of it) but everything else is like ….wait…seriously? I’m curious to know as well!
1270 2018-01-29 21:19:42 Didn't the president just lift sanctions on oil companies being responsible for their own spills in the ocean?
1271 2018-01-29 21:19:42 I'd take the oiled name back in a heart beat. The roughnecks ain't bad either considering it's an oil rig worker...  lol
1272 2018-01-29 21:19:17 君を揚げたいな…君を炒めたいな…君に僕を絡めたいな…僕は君のそんな存在になりたい。いや、既になってるだろう?
1273 2018-01-29 21:19:16 Sadly rights and administration seem to be oil and water that don't mix. 

It's not at all right to expect you to prosecute on the hoof - but we all know it's done routinely. Sadly it's the lack of prep and inattention to detail that are causing all the headlines at the moment.
1274 2018-01-29 21:19:13 as OK's AG, he sued the EPA eight times. He took oil company complaint docs and copied word for word on OK Attn General letter head and sent to the Obama EPA. He's a bought off POS that works for Harold Hamm.
1275 2018-01-29 21:19:04 on the face i cleanse then use a fresh aloe vera mask and leave it on for 15 mins and rinse with cool water, tone with witch hazel and moisturize my face with vitamin e oil or with jojoba oil. any blemishes i dab a little tea tree oil. i also exfoliate once a week.
1276 2018-01-29 21:19:03 Rides into the sunset potentially collecting millions in retirement. Talk about elite.
1277 2018-01-29 21:19:03 Do NOT burn or mist any oil if you have cats. It is poisonous!!!
1278 2018-01-29 21:19:02 exfoliate to prevent pimples. she butter after showers and vitamin e oil!
1279 2018-01-29 21:18:51 Not I. But damned good question. But then, didn't Peter Mansbridge shill for oil companies while employed by #CBC?
1280 2018-01-29 21:18:49 I'll baby oil that beautiful ass all day!
1281 2018-01-29 21:18:42 Two Million Barrels of Dirty Texas Oil Capacity! Just enough for any cold snap in the @isonewengland thanks to the short sighted @clf . We need the @Northeastgas and @NEPowerGen to push for new gas pipeline capacity in New England, and not import illegal Russian LNG
1282 2018-01-29 21:18:40 The price of Exxon oil is going up to pay for the investment, shares of stock will go up, consumers lose investors win.
1283 2018-01-29 21:18:31 (i like sauteeing in olive oil w garlic if you have it or onion and garlic powder if you dont)
1284 2018-01-29 21:17:52 Shale oil is being funded with mercantakist/petro dollars still.

1286 2018-01-29 21:17:45 Well. I was looking at how to make homemade hair masks. Then I saw : « take your egg yolk and vegetal oil and whip it ». That’s mayonnaise.
1287 2018-01-29 21:17:40 Why?
-Globalisation
-Attracts the most Foreign Investment (especially from it's longevity and ties with Europe).
-It's Diverse Economy
-Diverse amount of raw materials; rare metals, diamond and gold (except oil).
1288 2018-01-29 21:17:23 Nothing to do with the price of oil, eh?
1289 2018-01-29 21:17:19 Solo acceden al desc del Iva del gas oil los q pagan imeba... tienen q facturar muy poco
1290 2018-01-29 21:17:10 Lol, alright sure. Cook your indomie first , when you done then you pour the spices on it , after you wash your vegetables and cut them to, put the pan on fire and pour oil in it when is hot you drop the vegetables stir with some pepper add ups and eggs ,then you add your indomie
1291 2018-01-29 21:16:57 Bought and paid for by big oil and coal. How, exactly, do Americans profit from leases on federal land, again?

1298 2018-01-29 21:16:10 Oil prices have risen dye to OPEC supply cuts. That's the only reason non-OPEC companies *worldwide* are drilling.

1300 2018-01-29 21:15:57 A mysterious, unattended bottle of olive oil has appeared in the weights section of my gym. End tweet.
1301 2018-01-29 21:15:54 Blood, sweat, spit, and a filthy tongue. Oh, the oil field hurts like a snake bite stung.
1302 2018-01-29 21:15:53 A fucking oil company. I know you're too dumb to see why this is a bad thing, but nobody thinks you're intelligent enough to listen to anyway.
1303 2018-01-29 21:15:53 Saudi Arabia runs biggest refinery in America, where Canadian oil is to be shipped across American land.  Don't even pretend to care about American energy independence.  We are getting screwed.
1304 2018-01-29 21:15:46 You have no plan and projects for your citizens bc if you do you should have done so irespective of oil price. You are selfishness.
1305 2018-01-29 21:15:38 IN 2018 we leave the EU and in 2020 the oil runs out. Britain goes broke. There you got your country back Brexiters  and here  is the bill.
1306 2018-01-29 21:15:18 No, it's cause you removed the safeguards they were required to have following the DeepWater Horizon disaster and the removal of the tax on oil production to help pay for oil spill cleanups.
1307 2018-01-29 21:15:17 #NationalCornChipDay The corn chip or "friotes" are not to be confused with the tortilla chip. Both are made from cornmeal which is baked or fried in oil. However, there are different steps for processing the corn that separates the tortilla from the corn chip.
1308 2018-01-29 21:15:14 Oil furnace malfunction!
1309 2018-01-29 21:14:59 Besides being great to curb sugar cravings, grapefruit oil is also been known to help relieve signs of depression #MondayMotivation #essentialoils #aromatherapy
1310 2018-01-29 21:14:56 That’s what the Memo is dufus! A partisan hack job. Geeze these people are leaking oil at this point.
1311 2018-01-29 21:14:56 Gotta get an oil change this week
1312 2018-01-29 21:14:37 The truth is the North Sea has 40 years left. West of Shetland much much longer & the whole West Coast porbably much longer than that. Scotland is oil rich until at least the end of this century!
1313 2018-01-29 21:14:23 Vitamin e oil or tea tree oil diluted with water
1314 2018-01-29 21:13:51 charcoal mask & then argon oil

-Govt-owned ONGC to acquire 51.11% stake in Govt-owned HPCL for Rs36,915 crore. That's divestment as per Pakodanomics 

-Scam-tainted Essar Group bags a hefty Rs 32 crore order from govt-owned ONGC to drill oil wells in Bokaro 
1321 2018-01-29 21:12:43 We don’t want their fracking and oil wells on our beautiful mountains!
1322 2018-01-29 21:12:28 Well, if we do what I suggested, we'd soon find out! Tax also would include oil and gas revenues, which are in Scotland, so would be attributed to Scotland, also Scottish whisky exports, which is currently attributed to WM

1324 2018-01-29 21:12:22 Hey what your guys opinion on oil etf's?? Good investment..hate this b.s monetary system
1325 2018-01-29 21:12:21 That's news? I saw a pod of over 2,000 dolphins off Cape Point about 15 years ago. The wake they created was larger than an oil tanker's. #SouthAfrica
1326 2018-01-29 21:12:02 Not my Walmart. My perm & carols daughter and olive oil and black magic and all the other stuff is right there on the open shelf and I live in a predominantly white neighborhood.  Maybe the people at her Walmart was stealing the black products whey they locked them up 
1327 2018-01-29 21:11:50 Don’t forgot to add when cooked in oil and salt diabetes and heart disease.  Can celebrate at the hospital with some fries.
1328 2018-01-29 21:11:48 main ingredients are spinach, beef, chicken & shrimp. cooked in Palm oil
1329 2018-01-29 21:11:42 Actually they are correct. They have cut regs 4 kids using comm pesticides & regs on lead bullets know to kill eagles through lead poisoning, increased off shore oil drilling, open pub lands to drill & dev. Just 2 name a couple. It seems YOU need more info.

[text] You can check my oil later with your dipstick. 
1331 2018-01-29 21:11:22 Something about an overturned oil tanker
1332 2018-01-29 21:11:09 do not forget the capex plays as higher oil prices allow for better planning, reserve replacement is at all time lows and lots of capital left industry -> nice setup for rebound eg in drillers ($ESV, $RDC, $BDRIL, $RIG etc) #BangForTheBuck
1333 2018-01-29 21:11:04 For you to pull out of the Sanchez deal yet spend £240m roughly on a defence is rather laughable! Once the oil barrens get bored you will be resigned to being fodder as you are used to! #ofnoconcern !! Far bigger clubs like Arsenal, chelski, Liverpool, Spurs & Utd will prosper
1334 2018-01-29 21:11:04 When America takes all the oil from Nigeria and they’re broke>>.
1335 2018-01-29 21:10:55 Having a car is so annoying when it’s time to get oil changes and keep up with everything

1340 2018-01-29 21:10:40 @Flora could you tell me if your Flora Dairy Free contains sustainable palm oil as it is not clear from ingredients or packaging? And if not, why not?
1341 2018-01-29 21:10:37 Wow. I didn't know that. Thanks for sharing.

1346 2018-01-29 21:10:06 I was like no, I didn’t mean I need an inspection done. Just a oil change please 
1347 2018-01-29 21:10:05 Yep, I guess he went to a school in a state that can only afford a 4 day school week because the republicans gave the oil companies a 2% tax rate (national average 8%) for fracking while accruing a billion dollar debt. Kinda sounds exactly like Oklahoma!  Enjoy!
1348 2018-01-29 21:10:03 Why do some girls feel the need to pull out their oil blotting sheets in the middle of the class...I don’t wanna be seeing your greasy face. Do that shit in the bathroom
1349 2018-01-29 21:09:54 Oil, gold, stocks, real estate, food and clothing excluded, I agree. Still puzzles me why exponential improvements in productivity and technology hasn't delivered purchasing power increases
1350 2018-01-29 21:09:39 We should have taken Iran's oil. We could lower the gas prices and help save money for our crunchy roll subscriptions.
1351 2018-01-29 21:09:35 Make sure they haven't covered me in oil first, please.

1353 2018-01-29 21:09:04 True - they are little more than a banana republic with a narrow slice of natural resource extraction (oil) business as the backbone of their shrinking economy.
1354 2018-01-29 21:09:03 Ah maybe not but your father had shady oil deals with the Saudis and other repressive nations.
1355 2018-01-29 21:08:59 I wonder what will b revealed when the ages & status of politicians & public service personnel r analysed 2 see if there's any correlation w/ policies being promoted just 2 deal w/ their issues! 'Noisiest squeaks get the oil!'Quote.

1357 2018-01-29 21:08:27 no there is not. Lyon Diet Heart Study did not use olive oil, a lynchpin of the "Med diet." Therefore not a test of the Med diet.

1361 2018-01-29 21:07:48 Great. Finally you're getting the point. 

The point is a 29 year old left the family business and leveraging the contacts he'd built working for years almost bought a freaking oil company in Europe without asking his rich Dad for a dime or any introductions. He did it by himself
1362 2018-01-29 21:07:42 I am crrrrying, kim got on the table to take pics for her app and had oil all over her body and got it on the table... as soon as she got off all you heard “omg if I don’t get this stain off the table kanye is literally going to kill me”

1370 2018-01-29 21:07:13 Britain wanted their oil, and Iran wanted to nationalize it, because it was theirs. CIA overthrew the legitimate Iranian government, installed the Shah, who began a a reign of terror to cement his power.

Well, the US’ power. The Shah knew where the real power lay.

1372 2018-01-29 21:06:58 Unsolicited info here- has anyone recommended oregano oil? I had a nasty sinus infection last year & inhaling the steam from a few drops of oregano oil in boiling hot water for a few days melted that ish right out. It’s a natural anti-fungal & anti-bacterial. Feel better soon!

1376 2018-01-29 21:06:42 So when your official newsletter said that "there has also been some funding from 'big oil'" that was a lie? And the Wikipedia article that asserts "donations from industry donors were passed on to the Science Education Fund...which ...supported...Friends of Science" is wrong?

1380 2018-01-29 21:06:20 @AliVelshi The only reason @gop does not want to raise the gas tax is WE will get more efficient cars and oil production will go down; this is why that charlatan ass reagan repealed carter's cafe standards while mouthing the words: do not let the gov't tell you what car to drive
1381 2018-01-29 21:06:20 Ooh, how’s it smell? Does it control too or just moisturize? I’m using this Bossman gel oil that smells like WD40 (to me) but I need a balm or something to keep it under control too.
1382 2018-01-29 21:06:09 Grilled whole and served with salt, pepper, olive oil, garlic and tehina
1383 2018-01-29 21:06:02 Allah sarki you're not even remorseful abt the fact that he didn't marry her. You could have mentioned that.
1384 2018-01-29 21:05:50 Their "investments" likely to be heavy on acquisitions. XOM needs more reserves. Oil not going away anytime soon
1385 2018-01-29 21:05:28 Here we go again, far irrelevant man trying to put his nose into the asses of people more popular than himself, I can’t imagine what you smell like, I imagine sausage oil and regret.
1386 2018-01-29 21:05:23 I called maintenance because I smelled gas in the apartment building. Turns out it was just the oil based paint they used to paint the empty apartment across from me.   and then as a thank you, my dog nipped at the maintenance guys sleeve. #baddog #badnose
1387 2018-01-29 21:05:14 John West in sunflower oil!
1388 2018-01-29 21:05:12 Yes, fine foodly, but believe palm oil is bad in an environmental way.
1389 2018-01-29 21:05:08 Please advance the Alaskan model w/o the slush fund, paying out oil revenue share to South Carolinians rather than go in State of local coffers.
1390 2018-01-29 21:04:38 I was craving pepper, so I made palm oil fresh pepper rice yesterday and it was good. Did it again today brethren, izz only pepper that is in this plate 
1391 2018-01-29 21:04:36 Good... But you have proved my point... The GDP rising means the everyday man is starting to have more money, there is more money circulating below... The last 3 years of very little economic growth, in my case, projects not taking place in oil and gas, is reversing
1392 2018-01-29 21:04:30 Well it was reported they saved 1.5 billion on their taxes and with the welfare they get for their oil interests I would say they did quite well
1393 2018-01-29 21:04:21 Thank you President Trump. I may just get my job back eventually in The Oil Field because our economy is back up. I lost my job and have worked missionary work until I can land another job in the oil field as a computer engineer. You know I now want to work for the Whitehouse.
1394 2018-01-29 21:04:18 Sorry, but terribly wrong:) WW1 is planned to invade middle east by dividing the wholeland into pieces by creating "puppet" countries: to steal the oil and all the resources of the wealthy lands. Unfrtntly, in1915, Mustafa Kemal of Turks tore this project up.
1395 2018-01-29 21:03:57 Not sure I trust balloons that much to hold that much baby oil. The leak could be really messy!
1396 2018-01-29 21:03:43 so were you involved with yukos oil ?
1397 2018-01-29 21:03:26 As a cancer survivor I am on medicinal mj for pain and nausea. I have COPD so  I use oil. Vaporizers work well with little to no smoke.
1398 2018-01-29 21:03:18 Very good thank you Polly :) I hope you are too

1403 2018-01-29 21:03:08 Lack of consideration on ownership models is the reason we have backlash on wind energy and places like scotland, germany don't. Also same reason we make no money from our off shore oil/gas resources..
1404 2018-01-29 21:03:05 I ordered my own you have to oil yourself first then do it it’s uncomfortable sometimes I’m not consistent
1405 2018-01-29 21:03:04 ISIS is desperate the gig is up. #GWB should have finished them off years ago but he listened to his Saudi masters and decided to go after Saddam Hussein for his oil which he never took and let ISIS take it. Genius move! #TRUMP taking care of business

1410 2018-01-29 21:02:21 Those sanctions will hurt. *45 has already tried to pave the way for lifting them, by targeting Iran. We'll "need" Russian oil, in the absence of Iran. Our Secretary of State is a former big oil CEO.

1413 2018-01-29 21:02:08 today i got an oil change, a full tank of gas, a car wash, and my car inspected. i am thriving
1414 2018-01-29 21:02:03 That and a spoonful of dolphin oil.
1415 2018-01-29 21:02:00 I jokingly told a guy who owns his own oil and gas company that I'd "endorse" him for something on LinkedIn. Y'all, when I tell you he CACKLED in rich white man...
1416 2018-01-29 21:01:57 Now to go sit at Honda for an oil change
1417 2018-01-29 21:01:35 I hope you know that, in America, solar energy provided more jobs than coal and oil combined. Solar energy and other renewable sources of energy are essential to future generations!
1418 2018-01-29 21:01:34 saw this tonight on I Player. An excellent program, I've had a real good look at reducing plastic in my life, now it's time to look at palm oil too.
1419 2018-01-29 21:01:33 Yessss please do
1420 2018-01-29 21:01:31 I feel you. I hit something on a DFW highway that tore up my oil pan, only to get hit by a red light runner six weeks later. Car was totaled.
1421 2018-01-29 21:01:31 Canada is not on the list.
Fossil fuels are heavily subsidized in many countries, esp. dictatorships. 
Not here. Here oil and gas subsidize the country AND keep us warm, lights on, industry rolling+taxes for common needs.
1422 2018-01-29 21:01:29 Are you able to produce the oil from a broken place?
1423 2018-01-29 21:01:25 I thought you were the party of supporting the police? Admit that you elected a snake oil salesman, it’ll make it easier when he’s arrested
1424 2018-01-29 21:01:21 That’s right! You were the guy who sold me those 55 gallon barrels of fresh squeezed dolphin oil. (That’s the worst thing I could think of that wouldn’t get me kicked off of Twitter.)
1425 2018-01-29 21:01:03 Ecuador makes progress on oil exports talks to China
1426 2018-01-29 21:00:58 We WANT green energy not oil.  Get with 2018.  We aren't living in the 50's.
1427 2018-01-29 21:00:52 If you use straight coconut oil as moisturizer I still love you but I probably don’t trust you
1428 2018-01-29 21:00:51 Stop buying the Palm oil products ! PEPSI is one

1431 2018-01-29 21:00:40 Have you tried Piriton? Or Night Nurse (check dosage on both but they work for me). Warm bath, no screens, lavender oil on pillow, hot water bottle - those are my suggestions. I don’t know what else to suggest xx
1432 2018-01-29 21:00:39 Yes because USA and UK will join forces and become a super power against the Middle East due to OIL, it’s all been planned and plotted for a long time!
1433 2018-01-29 21:00:34 PSA: If your eyeliner/mascara smudges then you might need oil resistant makeup, not waterproof. Waterproof usually means wax based. Skin oils will melt that shit away. Find mascaras and liquid eyeliners where the 2nd ingredient is acrylates copolymer or some variation thereof.
1434 2018-01-29 21:00:33 @KATVONDbeauty lock it setting spray or @UrbanDecay all-nighter oil free one are great for those sweaty situations 
1435 2018-01-29 21:00:28 Earth need this oil. Its like take the blood out of your body. 
It will not be allowed anymore to take it out.

1439 2018-01-29 20:59:39 Syria has little oil compared to Iraq or Russia, plus all of its oil infrastructure is destroyed, America isnt about oil, its about selling that oil in dollars, nobody will sell oil in rubles so Russians have no use for Syrian oil.

1457 2018-01-29 20:56:51 "Andrew Moulden was a germ theory denialist, a conspiracy crank, a 9/11 truther, a failed politician, and a snake oil salesman offering an Internet-based magical procedure that will uncover the true causes of everything from shaken baby syndrome & SIDS to dementia  Alzheimer's."

1469 2018-01-29 20:54:53 If you saw a world full of huge, complex social problems and your solution was essentially "clean your room", you'd be famous too.  It's modern day snake oil. People love simple easy solutions to complex problems. Until they realize it doesn't work...

1493 2018-01-29 20:51:23 I never see anyone complaining that there aren’t enough women working on oil rigs or in mining.

1496 2018-01-29 20:51:10 Agenda 21 is a hoax from conspiracy theorist. Yes, we could have cars that have much better mileage and they even exist in Japan at least as protoypes. Cheap oil has been a huge deterrent as is the cost of making these vehicles with ultra-light components.

1535 2018-01-29 20:43:40 Yeah more leaking oil pipelines at the cost of America's drinking water and more stolen land from the Native Americans right.

1553 2018-01-29 20:41:08 My guess is: Not sure they'd need him for that anyways plus they're in the Middle East with more oil/gas than Africa has where they'll have more than their fill of such deals without needing him.
1554 2018-01-29 20:41:00 And today there were 2 Russian oil tankers in Boston , Great job trump on following the sanctions oh right you refuse to sign it .
1555 2018-01-29 20:40:53 Where did the oil purchase from and arms shipment to Daesh/ISIS go forgotten? “American reliance on the People’s Protection Units (YPG) is a self-inflicted error when the United States already has a capable partner in Turkey,” Çavuşoğlu said.
1556 2018-01-29 20:40:51 Actually he will if he (the U.S.) will if they want to continue their raping our oil and gas. NAFTA enforces Canada to sell its oil to the U.S. Why do you think we don't have east, west pipeline? It's not due to Libs, environmentalists or native issues like everyone believes.
1557 2018-01-29 20:40:41 Permanent jobs?? But you’re the oil industry. What permanent jobs will you be creating exactly? @exxonmobil #corporatetaxcutisgood #buttheresalwaysabut
1558 2018-01-29 20:40:41 There is a welding method called a fillet weld. We see it alot in the structural work in the end of the Oil and Gas industry I am in.
1559 2018-01-29 20:40:35 News is that Indian 10y yields were up today, because US yields are up by 10 bps in the last few days and Oil price too is going up.
1560 2018-01-29 20:40:27 Honestly no it’s weird it makes me a lil dewy but I liek the dewy look. I do witch hazel, then a tea tree spray, then bio oil then the matte moisturizer. I don’t put hella hella of the oil justa thin layer

I do butter and coconut oil blended and it's super creamy and rich
1564 2018-01-29 20:40:13 What gives? The U.S. pumped more oil than Saudi Arabia last year, so these prices should be dropping! #energy

1567 2018-01-29 20:39:43 it's a weird fat-bomb-style coffee mix-in that my office mates had. it's coconut oil, ghee, and cocoa powder of some kind
1568 2018-01-29 20:39:39 A Texan who doesn't like oil?!? 
1569 2018-01-29 20:39:39 It will not be allowed in due time. There will be many other new technologies that don't use oil. We don't even need road anymore.
Space ships run 1000 hours on 1 pint of water. WATER with one adjustment to the vehicle.

1571 2018-01-29 20:39:29 Palm oil is so bad
1572 2018-01-29 20:39:19 it's a thing in a jar that's like coconut oil, ghee, and possibly like cocoa powder? it's probably the powder that makes it gritty
1573 2018-01-29 20:38:59 She sells snake oil that medical professionals have repeatedly debunked. Honoring her undermines any pretext that this conference is actually about helping women. Is it a who’s who of exploitative grifters?
1574 2018-01-29 20:38:48 I have bio oil and vitamin e oil (somewhere still packed but I'll find it!) so I could whip up a batch with both mixed! Thanks guys

1577 2018-01-29 20:38:34 If I weren't so fond of snakes, I would feed one to my cats occasionally. Perhaps REAL snake oil might be healthy.
1578 2018-01-29 20:38:28 The pet store recommended CBD for cats who are not getting along. On the bottle the label reads "CBD Hemp Oil for dogs, cats, and humans." I was the only one in the pet store that found this amusing. #thisis2018.

1580 2018-01-29 20:38:09 For oily skin, oily skin tend to produce more sebum and sometimes cannot keep the skin moist. Argan Oil will be added in the oily skin facial oil to help balance sebum in your skin and it's rich in Vitamin E oil/linoleic acid
1581 2018-01-29 20:38:08 My new facial oil makes my skin so smooth and gives it such a natural glow. I’m in heaven 
1582 2018-01-29 20:38:03 If it takes reading the New 52 I'd rather be bathed in hot oil. I'm going to have to pass on that recommendation.
1583 2018-01-29 20:37:47 Protip: get some good infused vinegars and olive oils to make your own salad dressings. Compliant and so many varieties! One of my favs was a plum balsamic with jalapeno infused olive oil.

1590 2018-01-29 20:35:59 Imagine! Music reflects and comments on contemporary events. Having a cabal of snake oil mafia controlling our government seems worthy of comment.
1591 2018-01-29 20:35:53 John west tuna in sunflower oil I love that.
1592 2018-01-29 20:35:49 Exfoliate and that glow will rise to the surface. I also include a rosehip oil for my daily moisturizer. You have good skin so you don’t need a complicated routine.
1593 2018-01-29 20:35:04 Pretty much standard set up for years in industry, most notably oil & gas.
1594 2018-01-29 20:35:03 I LOVE Tula! I’ve been using their products for a couple years now and cannot get enough! The cleansing oil is the BEST!
1595 2018-01-29 20:34:58 Add a few drops of rose oil to you skin cream - for broken thread veins. 
Rose oil is also extremely beneficial for the skin particularly dry, mature or sensitive skin and can reduce the appearance of broken thread veins. #essentialoils #aromatherapy #skincare #aromatherapy

1598 2018-01-29 20:34:24 Oil is a far more ethical thing to use than milk or eggs.
1599 2018-01-29 20:34:22 I'm guessing oil at 70 a barrel was the bigger driver

1607 2018-01-29 20:33:47 In response to PDPs renaissance, I will always be vocal about my lack of trust for a party that squandered the best opportunity to change the destiny of our country. We had record oil prices and output and there is nothing to show for it.

1618 2018-01-29 20:32:34 His paid RT interview praising Putin. His work for oil companies in Yemen as mercenary.  His 3 townhalls a year ago where he refused to endorse any investigations into Russia because “they have been doing this for years” he’s a traitor
1619 2018-01-29 20:32:31 Ooooh double whammy. Jobs coming back and a giant oil producer. The libs will be screaming helplessly at the sky for this one. They hate good news

1644 2018-01-29 20:30:20 I just bet a friend $100 that Exxon’s investment will come in oil drilling in the Utah monuments land recently cordoned off, the Alaskan wildlife preserve just cordoned off, & the coastal drilling to be forced upon various states.

1662 2018-01-29 20:27:15 Does this mean we can end subsidies to big oil?
1663 2018-01-29 20:27:10 How about renewable energy instead of more oil.  We should be focusing on reducing our need for non-renewable forms.

1666 2018-01-29 20:26:46 How do you know when they are ready? Or how long u leave them in thr oil? What sauces/seasonings do u recommend?
1667 2018-01-29 20:26:44 you know that’s not what happening here. GOP’s idea of draining the swamp is appointing unqualified known enemies as department heads in order to dismantle them from the inside out. this isn’t about shrinking govt it’s about continuing to line pockets of big oil/tillerson et al
1668 2018-01-29 20:26:40 So EXXON is going to invest $50 BILLION over 5 yrs in the US. How much will NYS see with deBlasio’s politically inspired suit against ‘big oil’. Who do you people represent?   Not those who elected you!

1672 2018-01-29 20:25:59 Know the feeling, same issue we had over at Global petroleum (#GBP), 3 billion barrels of oil RNS and 3 days later it's lost a penny and now valued under cash :( - value will out eventually my friend!
1673 2018-01-29 20:25:38 Pretty sure that 50 billion was owed to the US anyway after their massive oil spill. How many of the wildlife populations and habitats recovered from that? What’s that? They haven’t? Hmmm.....
1674 2018-01-29 20:25:22 Keep on recycling program. Conducting conferences every year on oil & gas won't bring change. One of highest producers of gas still can't boost 6hrs of electricity. #IsAPityNigeria

1676 2018-01-29 20:25:09 Being fully abreast of the landlord’s (the late Chief Ogunyade’s) weaker economic standing, the tenant (Mobil Oil) approached the courts to apparently intimidate the landlord. This Mobil Oil did with Suit No. LD/2360/2000. #JusticeForOgunyade

1680 2018-01-29 20:25:00 If people are worried about higher rates shouldn't automakers be most effected? Short end has moved much more dramatically and that is where car loans & leases are funded. Also, oil prices
1681 2018-01-29 20:24:55 Oil companies love Corporate tax cuts and massive deregulation! Yippee!!!
1682 2018-01-29 20:24:55 It’s good for your body but obviously not your drain. Unless it’s fractionated coconut oil, it will harden after it dries. Google benefits of coconut oil
1683 2018-01-29 20:24:54 Similarly, exports to European countries accounted for 22% of total U.S. exports of crude oil in the first eight months of 2017, averaging 193,000 b/d. In September and October, exports to Europe averaged 510,000 b/d, which accounted for 31% of U.S. exports of crude oil

1685 2018-01-29 20:24:33 The facial oil targeted for dry skin may also work well for those with acne-prone skin! One of the oils included is Evening Primrose contains a high percentage of linoleic acid and soothes the skin!
1686 2018-01-29 20:24:31 You can crack asphalt into smaller petroleum molecules by heating it up, but most of the results are trash. When you use zeolite catalysts, you get more gasoline product. Oil companies turn asphalt into gasoline using zeolite.

1690 2018-01-29 20:24:08 Art is political. Do you seriously prefer oil paintings of mountains? Music only major chords? Theater at a 3rd grade level? For real? If you don’t like it, ignore it. Don’t censor it.
1691 2018-01-29 20:24:07 Big data is not a barrier to entry

1697 2018-01-29 20:23:34 "euw oil"

Commenting on the use of palm oil would make sense, but oil in general?

1699 2018-01-29 20:23:29 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
1700 2018-01-29 20:23:26 Yup, there is zero difference in health, nutrition or environmental impacts. Just opportunistic snake oil salesmanship
1701 2018-01-29 20:23:26 In September and October, exports to Asia accounted for 40% of total U.S. exports of crude oil, averaging 636,000 b/d, or more than double their pre-Harvey levels.
1702 2018-01-29 20:23:21 The family arrived at a consensus that their tenant, Mobil Oil was oppressing them and so resolved that it'd be better for everyone if they shopped for another tenant, as a way of averting more untimely deaths among family members. #JusticeForOgunyade
1703 2018-01-29 20:23:06 How so? Virtually every major oil company is actively addressing exactly what I’m saying but somehow u think they r wrong? “Going green” right now is limiting the effect as energy consumption does increase and it’s helping us work toward actually lowing it going forward.
1704 2018-01-29 20:23:06 Having looked at your face? I'd replace those oils with serums containing the same ingredients and limit the brush usage. I use witch hazel+ face safe aloe as toner but I am an oil slick in the face.

1715 2018-01-29 20:21:48 Just sent off a used oil sample to @BlackstoneLabs1 to see how the @AMSOILINC Signature Series oil held up in the ‘17 Subaru WRX. This oil had 7,945 miles of service on it.

1724 2018-01-29 20:21:07 @realDonaldTrump @DevinNunes I hope the memo comes out it's supposedly about Carter Page( Russian Oil) FISA warrant being issued based on dossier. The same dossier they claim is false even though the concern was about lude sex acts and how Trump could be blackmailed. 1
1725 2018-01-29 20:20:40 I’m surprised it’s the oil that does it for you and not the sugar.
1726 2018-01-29 20:20:29 That would be lit, forreal. Looking forward to it since Basrah owns majority of Iraqis oil wealth hah
1727 2018-01-29 20:20:25 Duplicity at best. Trump had already won. If Hillary had won probably U.S would have not allowed resolution. Sabotage plain and simple.
1728 2018-01-29 20:20:23 or @GOP considers Russia just another special interest group with similar goals:  smaller US government, higher oil prices, consolidation of power & wealth into hands of small number of donors.  
1729 2018-01-29 20:20:11 Thank you! You need to go to @_ohsodelightful ‘s website. Link on her bio. Only adaptation I make is flash frying in a pan with olive oil, 1 onion, and a tspoon of chilli and cumin !

1740 2018-01-29 20:18:54 Yep, setting up off shore drilling, right off the coast of Mar a lago. Hope it doesn't mess with your backswing. PS we will remember this, when you are explaining why fewer regulations "didn't" result in the next major oil spill.
1741 2018-01-29 20:18:45 Faith doesn't come by praying and fasting or by drinking anointing oil. It comes by hearing the Word of God.
1742 2018-01-29 20:18:31 that's because you finally know ur far enough away to stop smelling the pachulie oil coming from L-town
1743 2018-01-29 20:18:27 Unless they learn to respect it. If they never go out there to appreciate it, you get people like Trump trying to drill for oil. I'd rather have more footprints in a protected space by people who care than one that is destroyed because it has no advocates.
1744 2018-01-29 20:18:21 Looks like a give, to get more...oil drilling still on.

1763 2018-01-29 20:16:00 They should considering their oil lease deal with Russia.  I hope they don’t think this means the sanctions against Russia will be lifted so they can finally get paid. Trump the Traitor needs to make sure sanctions are fully implemented.  Deadline is today!

1766 2018-01-29 20:15:42 This is absolutely horrible that shale oil drilling would be expanded while solar get shut down.
It is time for people to realize that tax cuts for fossil fuels is a dead end road and we cannot say, "but jobs" every time they tale a swing at the health of the planet.

1803 2018-01-29 20:11:02 That's what happens when your the biggest club in the world, not a tinpot fantasy team where the owners decided they've got nothing else to do with their oil money

1805 2018-01-29 20:10:34 This is wild, but I ran across jars of PURE coconut oil at the frekn dollar tree in the cooking section. The real deal that’s hard until it’s warm. That stuff can get expensive other places I’ve gotten it. Cool 2 know

1812 2018-01-29 20:09:53 WTI oil $65.67/barrel, -$0.48.
1813 2018-01-29 20:09:40 It's not the oil that's raising the pump prices it's the government and their terrible taxes not to mention the lack of subsiding our own oil resources and buying them from the middle east instead. Crude has been under $60 a barrel for 8+ years now.
1814 2018-01-29 20:09:37 Hot oil has gotten on my glasses...!
1815 2018-01-29 20:09:28 Ah, Ian. Like oil on troubled waters 
1816 2018-01-29 20:09:14 Did you used to be a oil rig gf nat 
1817 2018-01-29 20:09:13 Got my oil changed and found out that, somewhere along the way, my skid plate was zip-tied in place. Where did the bolts go? It's a mystery. I had to shore up the zip-tie job when I got home because something was dragging. I'm not much of a get-under-the-car guy, so be proud.

1822 2018-01-29 20:08:49 The Great Wall was available on my TV and that was my first thought (movie is well boring): you build this big ass wall to keep climbing things out, but you don't have burning oil or even hot water to pour on them?
1823 2018-01-29 20:08:45 I'm good either way. Next?
1824 2018-01-29 20:08:37 Super yummy again looks cracking and delicious for sure... another winner x
1825 2018-01-29 20:08:28 Or will big oil just leave any destruction to the environment, as did coal in PA.  You know those streams and rivers that are still polluted from coal?  Or the spills happening every day even in Dakotas. Barletta, you are bought and paid for, and do not work for the people.

1829 2018-01-29 20:08:14 This is all a giant circle jerk. For big corps it’s a huge PR win to advertise this as a result of tax reform. I don’t think XOM spending 10 bill in capex/yr over 5 years in US is an abberation with respect to previous oil boom cycles...

- 2 cups water / dashi soup mix
- chicken stock (half of a chicken bouillon cube)
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp mirin
- 1 tbsp sake (optional)
- strain into bowl

I buy ramen from the fridge section, so it's not dried.

1963 2018-01-29 19:50:12 I can never forget the only presentation I went to at COP21 where I felt uncomfortable. Where guys with earphones and suits were staggered around the room. Where the conversation was about how hard they were trying to bring Saudis into line. And about 'clean' coal and oil.

When are we having a constitution that represents us as citizens? When shall we dissolve NNPC & deregulate the oil sector? APC/PDP are not our problem.

1975 2018-01-29 19:48:33 Jimboman, any predictions for this week's EIA? I think we get near a crude build (think a draw of under a million), and that we get to 10 million bpd in next week's report. All these predictions of mine are just based on my feelings, and are not based on any concrete data :)
1976 2018-01-29 19:48:15 @pepboysauto living up to the close to zero expectations of good service. 12:00 appointment for oil change and tires. 3 hours later car is on lift and nothing is done...
1977 2018-01-29 19:48:11 Too bad it's all just a political game and that you sold your soul to represent Trump. What about #Venezuela #Russia the list goes on.  Anything to reverse Obama, for oil and money.  Used to be a fan, you lost my support.

1980 2018-01-29 19:48:05 Wrong. Oil on water: Transit + ST storage down 200MMbl YoY. See backwardation + tanker rates, classic bull market. Asia oil on water is necessary, little land storage.  Oil on water + China+ OPEC + OCED = -425MMblYoY. Taking away linefill. US has 45MMbl excess. 6 weeks to drain.
1981 2018-01-29 19:47:59 How can light and dark live together, oil and water, left and right? Opposites in philosophy or religion do not attract.....Christ Jesus has no concord with Belial.....Nor should any Christian have fellowship or support-the death cult of the Democratic party-Just sayin

1983 2018-01-29 19:47:49 This tariff is absolutely disgusting.  It will cost thousands of American's jobs, but it also makes our nation less secure and more dependent on foreign oil and power. Beyond that, we need to be focusing on renewable to protect our environment. Time is out.

2012 2018-01-29 19:44:16 The deal was "You take the UST's to fund our spending, THEN you get to export to our consumers."  If you're not gonna take the UST's anymore, you don't get to export to us carte blanche anymore.  We'll weaken the USD & whoop you in the marketplace - look what we did in oil & gas.
2013 2018-01-29 19:44:11 China is always manufacturing & producing cos they saw the importance of man power development & invested more in the people through technology. Nigeria concentrated on oil & abandoned manufacturing & production even when it was blessed with population figure & natural resources
2014 2018-01-29 19:44:10 I thought Volvos were like Hondas and oil was optional?
2015 2018-01-29 19:44:04 California has its issues, but I'll take California's strong, diverse economy over Alberta's, thank you. Calgary is still hurting from the drop in oil prices. It is not resilient. Alberta needs to think about its future, not try to re-live its past.

2022 2018-01-29 19:43:24 Once had an IT director come in to support his contractor’s argument for a price increase due to an oil price increase.  Reasonable man- not corrupt- just thought they had a point.  Read the contract, got calculator out- discovered they’d miscalculated both oil price rise and CPI
2023 2018-01-29 19:43:17 He believes in clean air and water yet guts epa and regulations and he’s in favor of oil rigs off of our coasts
2024 2018-01-29 19:43:11 Republicans should return all monies to Koch brothers because the got theirs from oil and deny climate change and are ruining our environment.
2025 2018-01-29 19:43:11 Next fall we'll all be wearing a Renaissance Faire style Halloween costume for oil wrestlers.

2034 2018-01-29 19:42:04 Nothing's wrong, just doing maintenance. Oil change, fluid replacements, replacing filters, all that fun stuff
2035 2018-01-29 19:41:42 Only 31% turned out because that was the will of the people! We didn’t want drilling for oil so we didn’t vote! That’s the beauty of the quorum, only one side votes and if the quorum is reached, NO ONE can complain as the people really did speak! #Simple #WATON #FBPE
2036 2018-01-29 19:41:36 have you tried garnier fructis sleek and shine oil? for me it works just as good as the more expensive oils & it doesn’t weigh down my hair 
2037 2018-01-29 19:41:36 Someone mentioned there is s Tusdian oil tanker outside of Boston Harbor. Did anyone order this fuel or did it sort of just arrive?

2065 2018-01-29 19:39:01 Might be, since Koch originally made most of their money from Russia. This goes way back. Between 1929 and 1932 Winkler-Koch "trained Bolshevik engineers and helped Stalin’s regime set up fifteen modern oil refineries" in the Soviet Union. Koch partnered with William Rhodes Davis
2066 2018-01-29 19:38:54 So happy with my #KulaPalm stuff. Love their products especially their charcoal soap which is a great dead skin cleanser and their Rewa oil is something to try out as well. Gotta love Fijian made items from our very own local, natural resources

2070 2018-01-29 19:38:14 Since I am actually writing a research paper on climate change, and have done extensive research for it, I can say without a doubt that this is total hogwash. Coal, oil, and gas are finite. From what I am seeing, the people want clean and renewable energy. Not this...

2083 2018-01-29 19:36:49 I’m definitely gonna get the tea tree oil , thank you 
2084 2018-01-29 19:36:46 Would you rather suggest an oil or keep a magneto?
2085 2018-01-29 19:36:19 If I don’t put on lavender oil before I sleep, I won’t sleep at all! #MyWeirdSuperstition
2086 2018-01-29 19:36:00 "Wanna know the truth? Nobody is happy. Nobody has skin made from oil paint and sunlight. Nobody understands this world. Hell, nobody probably understands math the way the claim. You're here one day and the next you're not.
2087 2018-01-29 19:35:44 USE THE OIL YOU KNOW ITLL HELP IT HELPS EVERYTHING
2088 2018-01-29 19:35:41 and i also usually mix my coconut oil with essential oils, and coloring and slowly pour that in teaspoon at a time. while mixing
2089 2018-01-29 19:35:40 didnt they stop using palm oil
2090 2018-01-29 19:35:32 Give me a break. He wouldn't put an oil rig up if there were oil but he'll put up a bunch of ugly windmills that kill birds that get caught in the blades.
2091 2018-01-29 19:35:27 I'm out of pulling oil. Problems.
2092 2018-01-29 19:35:22 Agreed. Alberta has a structural fiscal problem caused by changes to global oil markets. If one source of revenue declines, then come up with another. Taxes are a red herring...unless you're talking about a PST, of course.
2093 2018-01-29 19:35:15 If China/Russia/Iran have been transacting at a higher Gold/Oil Ratio (GOR) than COMEX/NYMEX, then whenever CNY oil contract launches, it would theoretically become a matter of US national energy security for the px of USD gold to RISE (if CNY is convertible under oil contract.)
2094 2018-01-29 19:35:12 Ashlye got me this necklace & the charm is a little vial full of oil blended specially for cancers and I LOVE it. It smells so nice
2095 2018-01-29 19:35:06 RT SupraChunk: ggreenwald i take it one hideous oil slicked version of Dynasty wasn’t enough for dims...  this Kennedy’s position on cannabis and the militarized police surveillance state is an outrage - i hope dims run this Kennedy in 2020 his candidacy would be buried
2096 2018-01-29 19:35:02 the "moving oil painting" quality of the ocean water is amazing and should be the only way to depict water in a game
2097 2018-01-29 19:34:47 Found a sand dollar today - has oil stains all over it:(
2098 2018-01-29 19:34:34 Use the coconut oil
2099 2018-01-29 19:34:30 People need to understand this; don't talk to me when I'm tired, I get super irritated.
2100 2018-01-29 19:34:24 @PMOIndia @arunjaitley as the @arvindsubraman interview shows all key growth parameters have bn on a downtrend over the last three years despite govt claims to the contrary. Lets hope the structural changes they hv been talking abt overrides oil price & interest rate rate trends
2101 2018-01-29 19:34:13 Someone pay for this oil change, I’ll be yo bae.
2102 2018-01-29 19:34:10 Ok. So. Can't be arsed putting them in order or choosing which of yours should be replaced but:

The gang solves the oil crisis
2103 2018-01-29 19:34:06 Has anybody used CBD oil for pain ? if so does it work ?? im looking at anything to help my mom with her parkinsons 
2104 2018-01-29 19:34:01 the bigger impact is probably on reducing foreign oil imports...ethanol lowers the cost of fuel at the pump and lowers emissions; plus with higher octane than gasoline, it improves engine performance. it will have a place in the fuel supply.
2105 2018-01-29 19:34:00 If China/Russia/Iran have been transacting at a higher Gold/Oil Ratio (GOR) than COMEX/NYMEX, then whenever CNY oil contract launches, it would theoretically become a matter of US national energy security for the px of USD gold to RISE (if CNY is convertible under oil contract.)
2106 2018-01-29 19:33:50 Peace is just waiting for u to leave. You guys are like oil and water
2107 2018-01-29 19:33:40 Red currant jelly is amazing on meat! But Chili oil is great on curry... Hmm which one is the best..?
2108 2018-01-29 19:33:27 Peppermint essential oil on the crown of your head will take it away
2109 2018-01-29 19:33:19 So Dershowitz is easily deceived. If u couldn't tell Obama was selling snake oil from the beginning then you're not as smart as you think you are.
2110 2018-01-29 19:33:12 Oil is scare to find beletan the the oil you like 
2111 2018-01-29 19:33:08 Devin NUNES...slick as a can of oil... apparently he not only covering up for Trump but himself as well....both corrupt reason they are attempting to shut down investigation... do the crime.. do the time... NO ONE... 
NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW!
2112 2018-01-29 19:33:05 I'm sure the new league and Lucas Oil will definitely garner bigger attendances early on. It'll be a nice facility, but a nice half full facility is never a positive. As for the fields, yeah, no artifical pitch is better than grass. See Lou City's partial turf...
2113 2018-01-29 19:32:31 is mild and works so well with the tea tree water in order to break down excess oil/bacteria.
2114 2018-01-29 19:32:26 We agree very proud of this student however you and Trump are denying Climate Science and by doing so making the lives of these students and our grandchildren worse in order to profit oil and coal businesses. Why are you celebrating science while ignoring science?
2115 2018-01-29 19:31:58 vaped a whackton of cbd hemp oil in the bathroom and im chilled out of my mind i forget what year it is and im just in the library no students to tutor today going buckwild on the net yeehaw
2116 2018-01-29 19:31:49 It’s very good. Because tea tree oil is one of the most powerful antibacterial essential oils, the tea tree water also carries those same benefits. It improves the overall balance of your skin at more rapid speed versus witch hazel. Grapefruit is also in the toner. The acidity

2132 2018-01-29 19:29:27 I don't think the tinkertankers have a understanding of 'exports'...for them any oil that is loaded on a ship is exports..oil can be loaded for floating storage..or shipped for storage on land..or it could be payment in lieu of cash..like iran to india...during sanctions
2133 2018-01-29 19:29:24 i take it one hideous oil slicked version of Dynasty wasn’t enough for dims...  this Kennedy’s position on cannabis and the militarized police surveillance state is an outrage - i hope dims run this Kennedy in 2020 his candidacy would be buried

2135 2018-01-29 19:29:17 Parachute Coconut oil. Works as good as gel in low temperatures.
2136 2018-01-29 19:29:12 So I went and got candle wax and sent oil to make a candle and the oil broke on me and now I smell like sandalwood amber 
2137 2018-01-29 19:29:11 Only African parents will hold a meeting because 2L of cooking oil finished within 2
2138 2018-01-29 19:29:02 Next to the bottle of oil you have to carry everywhere with you! You could fit a fucking full face lid under that cowl 
2139 2018-01-29 19:28:57 JP Morgan raised '18 oil forecast by $10 Friday to $66 for WTI & $70 Brent. Closing price on Friday was $66.14 & $70.52 respectively.

Would be easier to just direct clients to the forward curve.

2141 2018-01-29 19:28:51 Hell yeah. Very much worth it. One marker can work for a long while since it’s oil based. And since it’s oil based, it stays on there as long as you do each side of each shoe well, let it dry & repeat at least one more round. Holds up very well

2144 2018-01-29 19:27:58 Today I sat and drowned my body in oil , my skin glowed and I looked as if I was so well taken cared of. But I’m going to tell you a secret , all I wanted was to be set alight, so I could burn bright and perhaps be your light one last time.

Condoms, baby formula, alcohol, cigarettes,  Oil of Olay,  razors, some OTC medicine, instant coffee. These are all high priced high theft items that thieves can turn over quickly on the streets. But I live in Ca. where there is no crime
2148 2018-01-29 19:27:36 And I've read that Murphy's Oil Soap will also do the trick with acrylic paint and be much less harsh on the brush itself.  I experimented with acrylic paint and synthetic bristle brushes.
2149 2018-01-29 19:27:24 hmm, maybe not crisco, but coconut oil could be fun...

2156 2018-01-29 19:26:25 Shout out to @DannyCalderin3 with the coconut oil plug it’s quite helpful right now that I can’t really smoke with my surgery
2157 2018-01-29 19:26:17 Oil boom also means that other countries will do all they can to depress price because US oil is more costly to extract, and higher oil prices means more money flows to rivals and enemies. 

Trump doesn't understand any of this.
2158 2018-01-29 19:26:14 He didn’t butter/oil the pan 
2159 2018-01-29 19:26:01 WHEN GREED OF OIL IS THERE  .. THEN EVERY COUNTRY ATTACK ON SYRIA BUT FOR PAKISTANI TERRORISTS UNITED NATION IS HELPLESS ,UN NEED TIME MORE TIME AND MORE TIME.

Lo demás sigue igual
2161 2018-01-29 19:25:31 I must agree... Get your beard oil from HERHAIRUK though 
2162 2018-01-29 19:25:31 @JeremyECrawford Why does oil use "additional damage" when every other effect in the game uses "extra damage." Does it mean something different?
2163 2018-01-29 19:25:26 Pasta with mixed mushrooms and a tiny touch of truffle oil. Need this now!
2164 2018-01-29 19:25:25 Just make sure you mix the oil with some carrier oil like coconut oil/olive oil/grape seed oil/ whatever! So ya don’t burn yourself lol
2165 2018-01-29 19:25:23 It's not an edge if Trump doesn't know what he's doing or how to use it.

He doesn't know how to use it. 

The oil boom means fewer imports, and greater reliance on natural gas, which means less reliance on coal.

Oil boom means natgas boom, which means end of coal.
2166 2018-01-29 19:25:18 Coconut oil or baby oil helps with the itching. Scratching stretch marks makes them deeper thats why you’re not supposed to!
2167 2018-01-29 19:25:01 I use olive oil to make every dish I eat. I have no olive oil. I’m literally starving.
2168 2018-01-29 19:24:37 Stress (eg a wound) causes blood to thicken to slow bleeding. Result - slow blood makes brain feel underfed; it works poorly. Result: anger, overeating, drinking & suicide etc. Blood thinner (fish oil, aspirin, ginseng, ginkgo etc helps return blood to normal. IMO New York City
2169 2018-01-29 19:24:29 So....we don't just have to rely on "oil money" then? Best not tell the raggies!!!

2185 2018-01-29 19:22:19 I don't see anyone from the Bank Of England being arrested for manipulating the gold, silver, platinum, oil, gas markets... The Bank Of England are the biggest market riggers (thieves) in the UK - by a looooooooooong way.
2186 2018-01-29 19:21:42 Yeah but medicine and surgery are not snake oil, and have real measurable benefits.

2203 2018-01-29 19:20:05 CBD is safe for children and pets! I love hearing stories like this and the more awareness we can put out, the better. Not saying all pharma is poison, but lots of people have reduced their medicine cabinets by 80% or more with the use of CBD oil.

2222 2018-01-29 19:17:23 All great snake oil salesmen believe strongly in their product.  It's no surprise that #PINO #presidentinnameonly believes in the alternate reality and alternative facts that he's selling.
2223 2018-01-29 19:17:16 Today's lunch: sustainably caught #tuna, #olives, #Manchego cheese, #pumpkin seeds, extra virgin #olive oil.
2224 2018-01-29 19:17:07 The highlighter is just glitter mixed with some old coconut oil. I hate that I love the blushes, they’re the only good product
2225 2018-01-29 19:17:03 Might just take that oil field offer
2226 2018-01-29 19:16:41 And also.. get a good facial moisturizer for after cleansing and toning..

Even using pure olive oil daily, or almond oil, for facial moisture is good.
2227 2018-01-29 19:16:21 An oil embargo, along with other economic sanctions caused the Japanese to attack.  In 6 months, Japan was out of fuel, and USA and England didn’t want to negotiate.
2228 2018-01-29 19:16:12 I’m cleaning some of my sneakers a long with the wifey’s pairs! I also use @CrepProtect mixed with some water. I use the @Sharpie white oil based markers to re-whiten any White #BOOST midsoles. I usually do the medial and lateral sides at separate times then let em dry for 1 hour
2229 2018-01-29 19:15:45 For a natural and effective makeup remover, use coconut oil! #coconutoil #makeupremoval #natural
2230 2018-01-29 19:15:33 I wonder if the exhaust will smell like mustard. If you run an old Mercedes diesel on filtered cooking oil you can sometimes smell the type of restaurant it came from. 
2231 2018-01-29 19:15:18 Man like Abidin you know he touches my heart tbh Handan you sure you are his mum because you are like water and oil you dont mix #Söyleyemediklerim
2232 2018-01-29 19:15:18 @Tesco why do all your sandwich range use palm oil when the growing of it is killing natural forested areas?
2233 2018-01-29 19:15:08 Only 4 3ml 500mg peppermint cbd oil left!
2234 2018-01-29 19:15:05 Our Aquus range is also appropriate for more demanding functions in #aerospace, #construction, oil, #transport & #marine industries.

There is corruption, there are many political prisoners + many people died, who protested against this government. There is hunger, there is a lack of medicines. It`s very urgent !
2283 2018-01-29 19:14:37 yeah if oil stays above $60 a barrel
2284 2018-01-29 19:14:35 we're always our toughest critic -

1)You can do this - I'm a hiring manager. Attitude/Aptitude are better than experience.
2)work ethic, determination/desire to learn will help you overcome
3)As IF!
4)Check fluids, change oil on schedule, check the tires - it will be ok.
5) NOPE
2285 2018-01-29 19:14:27 Bruh Spanish so hard like why is a table feminine and olive oil is masculine like how tf am I suppose to know the gender of an object

2287 2018-01-29 19:14:13 @onesmileymonkey I love natural remedies.  I take a dose of vitamin C and oregano oil as soon as I feel the beginning of cold or flu #ShoppersFlu
2288 2018-01-29 19:14:06 Yes. Very much this. Also, i imagine the oil complex is very much tied in as well.
2289 2018-01-29 19:14:05 I think you can use coconut oil on your face, if you use a small amount along with something that’s moisturizing.
2290 2018-01-29 19:14:01 dulu someone used to ingatkan untuk cuci muka and letak tea tree oil sebelum tido. but sekarang takde dah
2291 2018-01-29 19:13:52 Not more wood stain or oil I know that. Gum also doesn’t work on it. Have you tried peanut butter? Might not work either but atleast you can have a snack after.
2292 2018-01-29 19:13:40 Oil is our renewable energy source!!!!!
2293 2018-01-29 19:13:18 lama dah tak letak tea tree oil kat muka ni. muka barai dah sekarang

2297 2018-01-29 19:13:04 Agreed. Need to look at it from a double perspective - personal development opportunities & demand reduction across services. I still don't understand why emergency ambulances aren't with Fire, for instance. Secondment might oil new ideas from within rather than those foisted on.

2303 2018-01-29 19:12:37 Coconut oil works amazing on stretch marks and actually help eliminate them!!! I have PUPPS and use coconut oil over the cream i was prescribed because it’s so moisturizing and helps! 
2304 2018-01-29 19:12:29 We don’t believe ur lies. 45 not helping all of us just Rich. Poisoning all of us with pesticides that cause neurological deficits; breaking & selling off our parks; oil drilling off coasts but not FL. We care about seeing his taxes & RUSSIA OWNING him. Russia is real.

2314 2018-01-29 19:11:04 Living in Washington state, when you say dab I think of smoking high concentrate THC oil from the head of a heated nail. 

Man, we’re in different worlds.
2315 2018-01-29 19:11:01 What I really am going to have to figure out is how much oil pressure to supply to the load sense line.
2316 2018-01-29 19:10:57 Maybe they should stop putting our products in the darkest corner in the store and they can keep a better eye on it. Why do I have to venture to the forbidden forest for tea tree oil?
2317 2018-01-29 19:10:54 The so called international community is a bunch of politicians without conscience. They all have hands in the treachery to hold BIAFRA down & steal BIAFRA oil & gas. Only BIAFRA & friends shall restore BIAFRA. Forget about international community. They are hypocrites.

2336 2018-01-29 19:09:17 The number doesn't work :(  I got a text back saying "Sorry, this service is temporarily unavailable.  Please try again later."
2337 2018-01-29 19:09:09 Olive oil, beer and eggs. Not all together though and remember to wash them out thouroughly
2338 2018-01-29 19:09:07 Vitamin E! It’s super thick. Put it on before bed and you can thin it out with coconut or avocado oil for a daytime moisturizer.
2339 2018-01-29 19:08:34 War over oil. Sorry, that stuff happens. But if it were truly about human rights, your government (and ours) would never sell weapons to dictators.
2340 2018-01-29 19:08:27 Infrastructure is important.  Western Canadian heavy oil producers continue to miss out on oil price  recovery with limited transportation options contributing to price discounts up to $28 per barrel over last few days.  @IHSMarkit @OPIS
2341 2018-01-29 19:07:45 That's a thing Masoud Barzanji hasn't done for years despite having rich oil Kirkuk, making oil trafficking, providing Israel for 70% of its oil consumption  and receiving economic support from Turkey.

2361 2018-01-29 19:05:10 But my entire point was that natural isn't always better. In the Lyon heart study butter was replaced with a very unnatural canola oil based margarine. Guess which group had lower rates of heart disease and lower all cause mortality?
2362 2018-01-29 19:05:10 Well we have an oversupply of coal, oil, and natural gas, and the Secretary of the Interior has interest in an oil pipeline company. Hmmmm, methinks the Dept of interior only cares about the interior of pockets, and dont give a rats azz about the environment.

2377 2018-01-29 19:01:47 oh lord you ever stir fry crimini mushrooms in sesame oil? IT IS THE BEST
2378 2018-01-29 19:01:31 Really crispy and fluffy. Used vegetable oil instead of olive oil, better this time.

2382 2018-01-29 19:01:23 Having just watched @ChrisGPackham  's In Search of the Lost Girl, I will pledge to stop using products with Palm Oil...first by changing back to butter from spread. These Rain Forest inhabitants are more important than me.  #rainforest

2384 2018-01-29 19:01:14 is gonna have to figure something out soon

#iran and saudi r just living in some dreamland far away from reality

all this denial is not helping them
2385 2018-01-29 19:01:11 Random customer: I need an oil change
Me: Ok, what kind of oil does your car use?
Random customer: Its electric so I'm not quite sure
Me: 
2386 2018-01-29 19:01:05 Billions i say Billions, sorry,  I thought you said how much oil have they found
2387 2018-01-29 19:01:03 Mmmm, sesame oil.
2388 2018-01-29 19:00:49 oil prices are up, Russia gets to sell new planes etc, and look like a Slate pitch: critics say Trump will be a terrible president, here's why they're wrong...
2389 2018-01-29 19:00:47 Blend 9 tsps clams with 1 pound Danish pastry. Mix into  Olive Oil. Squeeze out excess liquid Serve with chili
2390 2018-01-29 19:00:46 *Finishing an oil change*
"Wow, I managed to strip the oil plug. Next time I'll take it to the shop so someone else has to deal with it."
[Several months later]
*Starting  an oil change*
"Wow, this oil plug is really stipped, how did... oh... oh right..."
2391 2018-01-29 19:00:44 Expect to see more similar with oil prices higher and production ramped up
2392 2018-01-29 19:00:39 *spills boiling oil all over the entire front half of my body, completely burning off multiple layers of tissue* ah... epic fail
2393 2018-01-29 19:00:27 OIL DIFF: 3.92 -> 3.97
2394 2018-01-29 19:00:27 Le #Brent arrive à une barrière psychologique de 70$. Oscillation autour de cette valeur avant de tracer la nouvelle tendance. #trading #bourse #oil on s'attend à un léger retracement vers le bas. #analyse chartiste

2405 2018-01-29 18:59:35 What an inspiring story, Big dream chaser!!would make for a fantastic movie, however, since your bid for chevron Netherlands was a means to an end(interest in Africa's oil fields) itself, how about partnering wit ONE( an experienced operator) to make d move on Africa's oil fields
2406 2018-01-29 18:59:15 Getting my oil changed and there’s four empty seats next to me but this dude decides to sit across the room and stare at me wtf
2407 2018-01-29 18:59:11 Allan Blakeney was a wonderful man with great integrity and administrative acumen, but also a hard core socialist who nationalized potash, gas & oil, uranium, farm land and was wiped out electorally when saving the Crow rate was more NB than rescuing farmers from 21% interest.
2408 2018-01-29 18:58:53 Best at killing, imprisoning, torturing and stealing the oil and gas money, you are right, the best!!!
2409 2018-01-29 18:58:35 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!

Do you believe they had information that we didn’t have? Or did they act on information we all have?

2414 2018-01-29 18:58:19 Just a thought.. i have been told that the turbo of my car if not serviced in the right time and with the right oil was bound to break... but my car was serviced one month before and was alright ( 319 pounds alright) and even if out of service time IT WAS SERVICED and PASSED!

2419 2018-01-29 18:57:21 She probably got her info from that nontroversy where scientists "discovered" that feeding lab rats nothing but palm oil for two months straight will kill them THEREFORE PALM OIL IS BAAAAD RT RT RT

2422 2018-01-29 18:57:10 Are They searching for oil lol
2423 2018-01-29 18:56:52 Just spent 100 at the oil change spot #trumpbump
2424 2018-01-29 18:56:45 I look like Trewlawny from Harry Potter if I don’t use oil or cream. “Tear down that glass case, Mr Walmart.”
2425 2018-01-29 18:56:40 Most of that isn’t oil. A lot is electricity. Assume 10,000 miles a year at 20mpg. 500gal of gasoline at $2.50 is $1250ish a year. RBOB Futures are up 50% since June so assume loss of ~$600 since summer or about $400 since last year
2426 2018-01-29 18:56:32 Turmeric-infused oil makes so much sense, because turmeric is best absorbed when combined with a fat, black pepper, and ginger.
2427 2018-01-29 18:56:26 Me too, it's an oil tanker involved so a bit trickier to upright and recover. P

2430 2018-01-29 18:56:20 Fellas my life is in a wreck. Yet again mold started growing in my backpack, and my lavender oil wall fragrance I got from bath and body works for free spilled on my floor. I'm going to need to start a gofundme
2431 2018-01-29 18:56:13 @sburtonsound I am a hardly-ever user of twitter, but tweets are now dominating my social media inbox, so I took a look at my own account.  I found that you had done some tweets with a visual around my oil painting display at KTOO in December, 2015.  I didn't know.  Thanks.
2432 2018-01-29 18:55:59 Things you need to do when you are an #insomniac. Not have a TV in your room. Place your phone somewhere where it can't be reached. Spray your pillows with Lavendar. Turn on your oil diffuser. Turn off all lights. Earplugs. Take sleeping pills. And still...barely sleep.
2433 2018-01-29 18:55:52 ugh, oil and seeking funding from various sources.....Riiiiiiiisky,  good luck
2434 2018-01-29 18:55:30 I always get embarrassed when I go in to get my oil changed because they always offer to clean my car for me

2437 2018-01-29 18:54:33 I do live in the state most likely to incarcerate black men, however, and where our largest city is the most segregated in the country, so I think it’d be worth legalizing if only to solve that issue. Leave the snake oil salesmanship out of it

2440 2018-01-29 18:54:27 I can honestly say I have grown in the last year. I now do my own laundry, get my own oil changed, and pay my own bills. It’s a big step for me because I had to break the fact that my parents won’t always be here.
2441 2018-01-29 18:54:24 Weird how Regulations get cut, oil companies are allowed to do what they want and I am paying 50-60 cents per gallon more than last year. Hmm!
2442 2018-01-29 18:54:18 Yeah it was the poker we use to agitate the chips and it was fresh out of the oil when it made contact.
2443 2018-01-29 18:54:13 but your happy for Saudi money and oil
2444 2018-01-29 18:53:54 i mean, palm oil has some warranted baggage but that doesn't seem to be what the distress is about
2445 2018-01-29 18:53:52 yoda invaded iraq for the oil
2446 2018-01-29 18:53:45 Palm oil's supply chain is actively contributing to deforestation, death of animals, and climate change.
2447 2018-01-29 18:53:38 Hemp oil cured cancers.
2448 2018-01-29 18:53:32 InfoChip has been creating custom #RFID solutions for Oil & Gas fields for years. We strive to make the perfect tag for every situation.
2449 2018-01-29 18:53:09 No, I have from the effects of Pres. Obama’s wise and long-range planning - all done with great intellect!  All medical going up, Medicare, supplement, medicine from evil greedy trump’s!  Pharmaceuticals and all big oil and big corporations is totally their focus!! Prison soon!!
2450 2018-01-29 18:53:03 Isn't palm oil harvesting a devastating component to the rain forest deforestation problem?
Then again, she might just think oil is icky. I don't know.
2451 2018-01-29 18:51:52 $REXX looking like it wants to run again, oil price still up, #Lowfloat
2452 2018-01-29 18:51:48 First you should be asking.
1 how many elections in other countries has my government interfered in.
2 if election interference doesn't work, what levels do they stoop.
3 why are we so depending on oil that we have to cause instability throughout the world so we can steal it.
2453 2018-01-29 18:51:15 Good grief. I can't keep up with @IndyEleven moving to Lucas Oil Stadium & Meram getting traded & trying to work at the same time.
2454 2018-01-29 18:51:14 I can't believe people are just eating up that hannah bitch's shit just because she's a checkmark and a mathematician. Anybody can tell you oil is put in food. Does olive oil just not exist?

2460 2018-01-29 18:50:31 I’d love to find a moisturizer that played nice with my skin for $36! My current faves are close to $96. Yikes. Though I do love my cheap Palmers face oil as well.

2464 2018-01-29 18:50:16 I see Kazakhstan as a rich land, I think they have lots of oil.

2475 2018-01-29 18:49:04 Yet @TankerTrackers won't tell you this. Maidani and company (and the other narrative peddlers of #OOTT) will just continue their "yay exports" gimmick.

2479 2018-01-29 18:48:39 Did you use your test strips to test for ketones. Try interment fasting for 16 hour straight and add a little coconut oil to your diet.
2480 2018-01-29 18:48:33 Its 2018, the realer the better.

2482 2018-01-29 18:48:22 Nice result. My point was really a technical one on Arjan’s analysis. Seems to ignore securities pricing dynamics, assuming oil and gas securities prices would be unresponsive to large-scale divestment.
2483 2018-01-29 18:48:08 And let's not forget the Italians giving sweetheart deals to Libya for oil post-Lockerbie.
2484 2018-01-29 18:48:07 Akwa Ibomites, its pronounced oil not oryel

2486 2018-01-29 18:47:48 Get a good penetrating oil cleaner/lubricant. Or brake cleaner, then wash with isopropyl alcohol, then soap and water, and finally lubricate with PTFE when dry.

2490 2018-01-29 18:47:21 This might prove to be another tough sale to the American public.......Pruitt’s posters are a list of the regulatory rollbacks he’s delivered to his allies in coal, oil, gas, and chemicals industries. These gifts include the reversal of a ban on chlorpyrifos.

2492 2018-01-29 18:47:14 Tea tree oil is the answer to everything
2493 2018-01-29 18:47:10 I don’t have Telegram & don’t like IM-ing  But omg my keto journey is so jokes. I realized 2.5 weeks in that 1g of fat is 9 calories, not 4, & that I had been eating waaay too much fat. Like OD-ing on oil etc to try & hit my perceived targets  Ergo I have not lost weight.
2494 2018-01-29 18:47:07 election time with high oil prices
2495 2018-01-29 18:47:04 I bought an electric mower as was to lazy to get a jerry can, get gas and oil for the one that came with the place
2496 2018-01-29 18:46:43 Never listen to anyone who tells you coconut oil is good for your face they probably don’t believe in evolution
2497 2018-01-29 18:46:24 people who use Argan oil on their hair scare me so much
2498 2018-01-29 18:46:06 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
2499 2018-01-29 18:46:03 Men: Duct tape will will everything!

2500 2018-01-29 18:46:01 More people bought the book than were at your dad's inauguration so zip it, oil head.

2502 2018-01-29 18:45:56 Toilet Bomb: Baking Soda/Powder/Citric Acid or Lemon Juice/ (I use lemon)/White Vinegar/drop of dishwashing liquid & your favorite essential oil.Mix all ingredients.Roll into balls/put in silicone ice tray.Dry completely. Keep in airtight container. Throw one in yr toilet. Voila!
2503 2018-01-29 18:45:46 What would you say slut coconut oil?? 
2504 2018-01-29 18:45:26 I wish I could be on top of all this. For now, it's school and work. Still, nice little fall so far today. We have an M forming in WTI which, according to my novice charting, means bearish and a possible top has formed :)

2511 2018-01-29 18:43:58 Stop Oil Speculators! now setting the slow down in motion as they did in '06-'09! Gas  up in leaps as Oil is Gushing inventories!
2512 2018-01-29 18:43:50 Cold! Try working on an oil rig in Northern Alberta in minus 40 + wind chill,
man-handling endless lengths of steel pipe. That's COLD.
2513 2018-01-29 18:43:49 No, Europe was busy buying Iraq oil and selling military goods to Saddam Hussein in violation of the UN sanctions they agreed to.  Boko Haram?  Solved?  How did they do that? Go back to your comfortable life style.  The US will be there for you when the heaving lifting is needed
2514 2018-01-29 18:43:48 Yes, I have one of my dogs on CBD Oil for personality disorder and had my last foster on it for pain management with a side effect of him being able to walk again. While all people/dogs have different reactions, I've seen others have amazing results.

2518 2018-01-29 18:43:14 Big emission reductions from coal, which is of low value (low price) & can be relatively easily substituted by renewable and/or gas. Take a look at Figure 3. Also, earlier research by @TofMcGlade and me showed that near-term coal phase-out is needed rather than oil/gas phase-out.
2519 2018-01-29 18:42:41 @oilfractals @CashErrthing interesting webinar, funny how they also were surprised by the rebound of Texas oil production
2520 2018-01-29 18:42:32 yeah, man, but we didn't figure out that it had palm oil in it by this picture so I'm just confused
2521 2018-01-29 18:42:25 It takes oil to bring water to the desert! Lol
2522 2018-01-29 18:42:22 YAY! My oil painting sold from Hitchin Initiative Art Hub!
2523 2018-01-29 18:42:13 I just read the ingredients list and there’s 0 oil, 0 trans fats, and 0 sugar in cyanide.
2524 2018-01-29 18:42:10 1953-63 decade of cheap energy, peace & dreams btwn Korea & Vietnam based on auto US culture now all gone except the T Rump grasping destruction to return. You caught it all here in these two signs in Houston, Texas centre of oil source. LBJ from Texas wrecked it by Vietnam. JFK?
2525 2018-01-29 18:41:59 You know you’re going to have a mind blowing date when you buy three bottles of baby oil & lubricant  
2526 2018-01-29 18:41:58 And where does baby oil come from, Tony?
2527 2018-01-29 18:41:58 I know of one man whose wife threw boiling oil at his face and blinded him in both eyes. He reported it to the police, but only after the nurses at the hospital had informed them. And then he committed suicide "because of the shame". Even though he did nothing wrong.
2528 2018-01-29 18:41:57 "All this oil, y'all cooking?"

2531 2018-01-29 18:41:23 Hey. If the coconut oil dont sliiiide back there then that aint my problem.
2532 2018-01-29 18:41:03 that’s a simple 1, if Weald is proven to contain oil that flows at commercial rates no one has been fleeced.
2533 2018-01-29 18:40:53 You are right, Matthew. However, the stats are tilted to reflect that Venezuela has private businesses. And the market share is not what a socialist state should look like. Shocker. But 50% of its GDP is oil, and govt seized it- essentially seizing the means of production.
2534 2018-01-29 18:40:48 ... only time my nigga sits in my car is to give me gas .. why drive mine when he can drive his it's pointless less one of our cars getting oil change like literally.
2535 2018-01-29 18:40:41 They tried to kill me all this fucking oil on these noodles 
2536 2018-01-29 18:40:22 Beard oil is a wonderful thing.  Even though after mentioning at church one of our leaders promptly shaved because he didnt want to be a "yuppie"
2537 2018-01-29 18:40:17 It's nonsense. The only thing it's ever been scientifically proven to do is reduce gingivitis which is what brushing your teeth does as well. Coconut oil is also a chemical. Because everything is - - so your point about avoiding chemicals is nonsense.
2538 2018-01-29 18:40:08 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
2539 2018-01-29 18:40:03 Downside of living in suburbia-4 hour waits at the oil change place

2545 2018-01-29 18:38:45 Why is this even an issue. A serving is like 2 tablespoons or something. So split it up by the amount you eat. Not that big of a deal. If you're eating the entire jar at once, you've got bigger issues than worrying about palm oil.
2546 2018-01-29 18:38:34 I have no idea where you are getting your facts from (Faux Noise?) but coal is going the way of whale oil and buggy whips, dude.
2547 2018-01-29 18:38:30 Try using a serum first. Like argan or maracuja oil.

2552 2018-01-29 18:37:55 @JerryMoran what is up with cbd oil being illegal in KS. STEP UP TO THE plate and get this overturned. Do research and see how it helps not hinders
2553 2018-01-29 18:37:42 Thanks, Nico. (Also for the link.) Good point. I see the argument for coal, at least in the developed world. Guess oil and gas were what I had in mind. Hard to see demand for these going away any time soon, even though we’d like it to.
2554 2018-01-29 18:37:30 Is it too late to become an oil company exec?
2555 2018-01-29 18:37:15 I need some  to relieve my throat.
I know that if you mix honey, lemon olive oil and ginger, it’s good too!! But  in the day, it’s very uncomfortable

2577 2018-01-29 18:34:16 instead of drinking coffee tomorrow Im finna do some oil pulling when I wake up, thatll absorb metals and toxins inside of my body and strenghten ur teeth and gum
2578 2018-01-29 18:34:10 Same with coconut oil. The islands where people consume coconuts as a staple usually consume the entire coconut not just its oil.
2579 2018-01-29 18:33:50 Oil is what you put in a car engine it's clearly bad for you duh

Drag races, ran it bone dry on oil once, 5 quarts to fill it, thought I had thrown a rod, nope, filled her oil and still had a tick but that was it. Drove her 1000 miles in 24 hours and she held on.. Would still have her if she hadn't rusted through
2585 2018-01-29 18:33:16 When I fried up those mozerella sticks, I reignited the hot oil of war.
2586 2018-01-29 18:33:00 it's the palm oil bro it's basically monkey blood
2587 2018-01-29 18:32:48 @simple_trends @Bamabroker @joefriday_714 I really think that once Brent-WTIC gets under 3, you see oil just collapse. Inasmuch as breaking above 3 started a 6 month rally, breaking below will see the opposite
2588 2018-01-29 18:32:43 I read somewhere that cannibis oil is often used to hunt rodents and rabbits. Small varmints if you will.

At least that's what Mitt told me.
2589 2018-01-29 18:32:41 @jimrome Alex Guerrero is a snake oil salesman and anyone who thinks he's doing ANYTHING WORTHWHILE is a moron...
2590 2018-01-29 18:32:20 We’re one of the top polluters in the world. We should change because it’s the right thing to do. At the very least we should quit using government resources to suppress oil prices
2591 2018-01-29 18:32:16 Awang awa na ko sa twitter ko. Walang kakwenta kwenta, wala man lang update.
2592 2018-01-29 18:32:00 A few years ago a friend of mine eavesdropped on a family meeting, a betha top same time but he recovered. I just saw things I shouldn’t see, I can feel the oil and water mixing, engine down very soon.
2593 2018-01-29 18:31:57 Wow.

I thought it was the sugar part too but it turns out it was the palm oil.

Wow.
2594 2018-01-29 18:31:54 I mentioned the fact there was a ton of oil in it too so im refraining
2595 2018-01-29 18:31:43 bullshit!  you had an address to send oil to.  bullshit!
2596 2018-01-29 18:31:39 I exclusively get my oil changed at the sketchy place by my house where the dude is literally lighting a cig with a blow torch while pumping oil into my car.
2597 2018-01-29 18:31:18 You shoulda just kicked them in the pool. Or replaced their sun cream with coconut oil. As a matter of fact, next time you find yourself in need of some dastardly poolside mischief ideas, holler at me. I gotcho back.

2600 2018-01-29 18:30:55 Me and petrol stations....water and oil.

#DontMix
2601 2018-01-29 18:30:55 The only reason needed is the Russian oil deal (Rosneft), that fell through because of Obama's sanctions. You need an oil man like Tillerson for that. He was supposed to do all the stealing. But the 500 billion project stopped in its tracks. Trump has no use for him now.
2602 2018-01-29 18:30:52 Well you might as well change the oil while you’ve got it all torn apart 
2603 2018-01-29 18:30:50 The laws hot by the oil mill and fairground

Y'know what. Sure, why not force yourself into anemia.
2607 2018-01-29 18:30:16 OIL DIFF: 3.91 -> 3.93
2608 2018-01-29 18:30:15 Better to compare it to a newly discovered commodity. Like oil when first used for kerosine.

2618 2018-01-29 18:29:00 That was one cause.  Other factors include deficit spending to finance Vietnam War w/out tax increase, deindustrialization, and OPEC oil embargo.  Result:  Stagflation.
2619 2018-01-29 18:28:58 True, they are in bed with big oil and it is a huge R&D cost for them to build an electric motor and battery. They can't use their red, tested and most importantly, paid for motor design.

2635 2018-01-29 18:26:59 As I've seen these palm oil forests for myself, plenty of monkeys and cows live in them. Maybe they can just make the Nutella in the forest since the milk is already there. 
2636 2018-01-29 18:26:59 No. But can I put a very strong recommend for Kniepps herbal  Eucalyptus cold relief bath oil next time you are passing anywhere that might sell it. It's heaven. And very helpful.

2647 2018-01-29 18:25:50 Oil has much higher value per unit of energy than coal. That is reflected in price differences. Also, oil has a very low elasticity of demand and supply boosts make prices collapse. Also, investment rigidities slow oil glut.  #GreenParadox literature never looked into that. (2/2)

2662 2018-01-29 18:24:16 I'm ready to have @royalfaberge to throw me out the window, I'M SCREAMING
2663 2018-01-29 18:24:07 If it's not one hour of @BTS_twt resulting from this ridiculous poll, I don't think #BTSARMY would think anything good. #iHeartAwards #BestFanArmy.
p.s. Kudos to you for adding oil into another round of fan wars.
2664 2018-01-29 18:24:01 Can you use it to oil a gun?
2665 2018-01-29 18:23:10 Evening Victoria, lovely looking job! Can the Graco gun be used with oil based paints? We’re thinking of investing in one but we’d like to see how other users are finding it before we do  - Chris
2666 2018-01-29 18:23:03 question: does anyone have preferences/tips/information on oil diffusers? i’m thinking about getting one to help me sleep better, but is it really worth it ?
2667 2018-01-29 18:23:01 An essential oil rack! 
2668 2018-01-29 18:23:01 Hi Pete, coal power plants are much more susceptible to uniform carbon price than oil extraction. Coal power plants have long repay period, high capital cost share and high emissions per kWh. Hence, future carbon prices trigger strong #divestment. (1/2)
2669 2018-01-29 18:22:58 I started a note on my phone today called “Things to buy once I have an actual salary” and the list has just become “groceries I wish I could afford” 

- salmon
- goat cheese
- nice olive oil and fancy balsamic vinegar
- fresh fruit
2670 2018-01-29 18:22:57 I added peppermint oil in my foot bath & omg 
2671 2018-01-29 18:22:53 Welp oil change is going to overdraft me, so there’s that. I hate being an adult sometimes
2672 2018-01-29 18:22:52 Ironic.  US oil companies are shipping petroleum out to foreign nations, driving up the price of auto gas in the US.  There is also a glut in natural gas, which is why gas producers in the Southwest have been switching between wells. But Russian gas is being shipped in to the US?
2673 2018-01-29 18:22:51 I got a huge thing of MCT oil delivered on Sunday. And yes lol it’s now separated !! Had to nuke it and stir it again.... three times.
2674 2018-01-29 18:22:25 My skin is pretty oily, though it does get a bit better in the winter (just v thin layer of oil not too noticeable) but summertime is hell, I shine like the sun and even after cleaning my face the oil comes back very fast.
2675 2018-01-29 18:22:22 Lorenzo’s oil change  #AutoPartsSchmovies
2676 2018-01-29 18:22:19 It is another essential oil. A spicy musky one with wound healing properties and also good for skin problems including dry skin and eczema. Essential oils are fascinating.

2678 2018-01-29 18:21:47 Coconut oil has helped me a bit with sore throats. I usually do a warm salt water gargle, then take a teaspoon of coconut oil.

2680 2018-01-29 18:21:05 And the twitter posts pouring hot oil in the wounds along with thick sand and rubbing the wounds very very hard..
2681 2018-01-29 18:20:52 So after I lost you I must have found me
2682 2018-01-29 18:20:51 @MSNBC @GOP propping up right-wing dictators(Contras ), while smashing elected leftists like #Chavez #Venezuela is ruining #US
#USA sanctioned punatively to #BringThemToHeel for banning private oil companies. They sold oil to build medical schools & other #PublicPeopleProjects
2683 2018-01-29 18:20:48 Just got suckered in to paying $50 for an oil change

2685 2018-01-29 18:20:34 how much do herd add to Nigeria's GDP? Instead of cattle colonies in every state, FG should rather push for building refineries in every state and FCT. After all, our economy largely depends on oil. just thinking aloud @ihayob @adeyanjudeji @ELBINAWI
2686 2018-01-29 18:20:31 Ugh. Days off really aren’t fun when you have to adult. Oil change, tire pressure light reset, and body shop for a quote on my bumper are all on the to-do list for today.

2689 2018-01-29 18:20:20 He will bake you a tray of Brownies, flex his muscles and invite you round to see his oil paintings and then you will forgive him. 
And probably never look at locky again.
2690 2018-01-29 18:20:16 Someone feel free to tell me and this 4ft 11 inch human how chicken marinaded in herbs and spices cooked in one of the healthiest ways (no oil/fat drips off meat) is unhealthy?
2691 2018-01-29 18:20:15 Boys will wash their face with olive oil and gasoline and not break out I’m over it
2692 2018-01-29 18:20:05 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
2693 2018-01-29 18:19:51 I love tea tree oil so much. I use it for everything but the smell  lol
2694 2018-01-29 18:19:51 Tapos nahabol pa ni tita yung doctor na mag reread, we got the result after 30 mins. Ok na agad.
2695 2018-01-29 18:19:49 I think if you add a little tea tree oil to the container next time, it won't mold! As long as your skin doesn't react badly to tea tree, it's a good option!
2696 2018-01-29 18:19:30 Not to mention the amount the state, by which I mean our taxes, subsidise big business. Oil, trains and banks spring to mind.
2697 2018-01-29 18:19:25 I don't know why I crave cheeseburgers but they're amazing! What I need to learn is to not eat Wendy's fries because the oil in it makes them just "sit" forever.

2718 2018-01-29 18:17:43 By who? A philandering snake oil salesman? Priceless! Btw, are you Russian?
2719 2018-01-29 18:17:36 They need to be moving away from petro all together, hybrid electric/hydrogen is the ideal goal. Hydrogen produced via electrolysis powered by solar systems, you can have those in your home. This is something big oil suppresses, kills them.
2720 2018-01-29 18:17:25 oh no :(( who got rose oil all over your mold

2723 2018-01-29 18:16:26 I know it’s really crazy , I’m telling you my Nana tans and she put butter and olive oil and crap like that on her skin . She never had anything ! She’s in her 80s I just don’t get it I think she’s right it may be underlining cause .
2724 2018-01-29 18:16:22 Ok lets see what got me busy the whole day..
2725 2018-01-29 18:16:16 Donald you started bad game on oil. It's not about the war. But it's about biggest US isolation. And step forward to biggest financial retreat.
2726 2018-01-29 18:16:11 That Nutella image reminds me of when I tell people Oreos are vegan & they’re like “oh cuz they’re fake”  flour, sugar, cocoa, and oil basically. How often to ppl look at ingredients?

2764 2018-01-29 18:11:40 For future GDP rate how can they blame on crude oil? Can they guarantee of growth in GDP if crude oil price goes highest low in history? C**tiya economist. crude#EconomicSurvey2018
2765 2018-01-29 18:11:36 Yes, while America stagnated in promoting oil, gas and coal! We have the village idiot for a President!
2766 2018-01-29 18:11:31 I've opposed offshore oil drilling for decades. However, the Trump offshore drilling plan is bit of a red herring; neither #BigOil or the governors are pushing for new leases off Pacific coast. The real problem: #JerryBrown has expanded offshore drilling in state waters by 17%.
2767 2018-01-29 18:11:23 "omg look at this picture, there's oil in Nutella" you open a jar and have to stir it cause some oil settles on top...are you dumb 
2768 2018-01-29 18:11:14 The oil field holes are filled with my life
2769 2018-01-29 18:10:58 Listen!!! Anybody with natural hair try using rice water and shea moisture Jamaican black oil treatment mask. It does miracles to your hair and restores the strength and moisture. It also defines your curls.
2770 2018-01-29 18:10:55 @Kimzolciak need your advice! If I can only afford 2 kashmere products, can you suggest which to pick? Something that smells good. I was thinking of the oil?
2771 2018-01-29 18:10:53 I use bio oil every morning and night!! Has done wonders for me
2772 2018-01-29 18:10:48 I actually don’t use a lip primer but I use a lip Sugar scrub with coconut oil in it before I use lipstick and it helps it stay on and not get clumpy throughout the day!
2773 2018-01-29 18:10:43 I think its an outrage.  Its well known you should aways serve it with the sugar on TOP of the palm oil.
2774 2018-01-29 18:10:42 That’s how I lost two mins of my life reading about the strategies of a successful oil mogul.. Until I realised that the mogul was Paddy Adenuga! Like what can’t you become with such a father behind you! 
2775 2018-01-29 18:10:39 Then because of it. sudden they start bombing the oil. That’s when we send trucks and parts manufacturing plant in Mexico.

2779 2018-01-29 18:10:04 Part of the reason why people in Venezuela are starving is because the US has issued an embargo that prevents food and medicine from entering the country.  Another part of the reason was that the economy depended on oil and oil prices dropped.
2780 2018-01-29 18:09:59 Shale oil drilling is fracking that pollutes our soil and water and endangers our climate. Please discuss the real risks @nytimes @ckrausss
2781 2018-01-29 18:09:56 Let oil go to 100 then we will see....
2782 2018-01-29 18:09:48 It really is I wish I knew this before I got the car. This is why I ignore the oil light for a good month 
2783 2018-01-29 18:09:42 Today in 1990, trial began for Joseph Hazelwood, captain of the Exxon Valdez oil tanker during the 1989 oil spill in Alaska (Windell 2015).
2784 2018-01-29 18:09:41 Looking forward to seeing the @IndyEleven Supporters come out in full force. This is going to be a good one. Currently searching for an airbnb near Lucas Oil 
2785 2018-01-29 18:09:40 United are funded by vegetable oil money... they just call them partners..
2786 2018-01-29 18:09:39 aloe vera and tea tree oil, and eucalyptus oil is healing
2787 2018-01-29 18:09:38 Man did he ever look after SK, just like the Cons in AB did..they took all that oil/gas money and blew it without saving any for the day the bottom fell out of the market & then they had to spend $ & reduce services & still increased debt. Wow, such a financial genius!
2788 2018-01-29 18:09:34 hopefully you just drove through an oil puddle? right?
2789 2018-01-29 18:09:33 I don’t get how this is gross. There’s not, like, fish poop in it. Oil goes into things all the time. Add some flour and eggs to this and you get cake.

The sugar content is BAD, but frankly not surprising.

2791 2018-01-29 18:08:57 So today while cooking... I got the drain cover on the sink stuck when trying to wash a pan, I stabbed myself with a knife cutting chicken, then I got my oil to hot so when I put in said chicken oil flew everywhere. 
I am hopeless today.
2792 2018-01-29 18:08:21 The more one glorifies the military, the more one encourages new recruits to fight for oil and other business interests.  We are not under attack except by our own govt.
You can NOT support the troops by lying to them and glorifying an illusion.
2793 2018-01-29 18:08:12 Greece and Venezuela had similar governments to the Trudeau government.  12 years later they are rioting over toilet paper and killing each other over the last salami hanging in the butcher's window. 
Canada will become an agrarian #Shithole when the oil runs out.
2794 2018-01-29 18:08:11 Indeed that's rite up my alley ., hot oil treatment one hell
2795 2018-01-29 18:08:08 Apart from his anti EU stance he's the best P.M. we never had, he got North sea oil flowing .
Fine fellow.

2796 2018-01-29 18:07:52 You'll have to oil yourself for that to work in Cape Town.
2797 2018-01-29 18:07:47 is coconut oil good for crusty ass lips?asking for a friend
2798 2018-01-29 18:07:46 Thanks Emma for such kind words. Will oil head to get through door!

2802 2018-01-29 18:07:29 Natural gas is trying to form a monopoly by prematurely closing Nuke plants; gas and oil are a national conglomerate that are lining the pockets of politicians.  Once this monopoly is formed, gas prices will go up. It will be too $$ to reopen Nuke plants so we will be stuck.
2803 2018-01-29 18:07:25 So, if Noble Trading Holding Co (NTHC) was told by Noble Trading (NT) that NT owned a "$ losing" cargo of oil, could NTHC move the $ losing cargo to the books of "Asset Co" (ie Noble Petro) and thus NTHC and NT traders could legitimately say they never had a $ losing cargo?

2806 2018-01-29 18:07:03 I would totally eat the shit out of his food, but he's so boring. You're positioned as the ace of competition, and you're so boring. Chili oil! Romesco! Blue corn!

2810 2018-01-29 18:06:54 That’s all thanks to Obama for expanding the US drone program with over 26,000 bombs in 2016! How many civilians did US kill? Faceless, soulless bombin drones are easier to control than broken soldiers with PTSD heading home full of regret from wars of oil and profit. #NoMoreWar

2812 2018-01-29 18:06:31 We’re not being crippled by economic sanctions because we can’t stop killing our political opponents or breaking other countries’ laws by committing cyber crimes.  Laugh away Moscow.  How’s that arctic oil drilling going?

2814 2018-01-29 18:06:10 Didn't say Iran wasn't a problem. But we love threat inflation. And we panic. Iran threatens no immediate US vital interest -- not attacks against CONUS; freedom of navigation or oil in Gulf; Israel can take care of itself, trust me. Iran w/a bomb is real threat; so stay in JCPOA

2818 2018-01-29 18:05:40 US isn't like Zim or Venez - at a high enough price of anything, the US economy can produce everything it needs (see oil, for example.)  This IMO makes currency-killing hyperinflation in the US highly, HIGHLY unlikely
2819 2018-01-29 18:05:24 I need a oil change
2820 2018-01-29 18:05:23 The economy in AB is doing great. The Carbon Tax, and other NDP energy initiatives, add to Oil companies ability to sell, what worldwide, is often considered Alberta's "Dirty" oil. This is why most Oil and Gas companies support Notley (and Trudeau) Govt.
2821 2018-01-29 18:05:06 Much oil. Very daddy

2826 2018-01-29 18:04:41 Oh yeah totally. That’s what I’m saying, people are barely paying attention to what they’re consuming?? Palm oil is in foods and lotions/similar skin care, how gross everything you put on you ,you inherently consume too

2843 2018-01-29 18:02:14 The thing about palm oil is that it’s bad for you and the environment but in 2018 it will start being used in many products in place of hydrogenated oils which will just damage us other ways. Everyone’s getting it one way or another

2877 2018-01-29 17:58:25 hi @NairnsOatcakes  can you tell me when you plan to phase out Palm Oil from your products? It seems out of place and not needed with local alternatives available. Time to clean up your act. #PalmOilFree

2914 2018-01-29 17:54:16 Is coconut oil inflammatory though?
2915 2018-01-29 17:54:11 It means you’re making oil money. I need a loan that I won’t have to pay back. If you’re not making oil money too, I need a loan that I won’t have to pay back

2941 2018-01-29 17:50:32 TEHRAN- Islamic Republic declares National Day of Mourning on Monday  for 36 Iranians burned alive in explosion of oil tanker on way to China. 
President Rouhani declares the victims to be "semi-martyrs", a new category of martyrdom , entitling their families to compensation.

2945 2018-01-29 17:49:49 Will you be at the Energy Mexico Oil Gas Power Expo & Congress in Mexico City this week?  If so, be sure to stop by booth 411 to see us with our agent, Rengen Energy Solutions.
2946 2018-01-29 17:49:24 Only 520 calories in total, made in olive oil. Oil is drained off on tissue before you put it into the roll.
2947 2018-01-29 17:49:16 Likely to see increased M&A in oil and gas as Saudis are coming to market.
2948 2018-01-29 17:49:00 When you neglect to get your oil changed regularly it can result in costly results down the road! #carrepair
2949 2018-01-29 17:49:00 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
2950 2018-01-29 17:48:56 Which reminds me the Portuguse FRITURA, Id est, any food deep fried in hot oil such as French fries and Dutch croquettes.
2951 2018-01-29 17:48:43 this nausea got me shook.
im so glad i have my peppermint oil with me.
2952 2018-01-29 17:48:41 Aku gila² jaga muka. Cleanser, toner, oil control, exfoliate. Cibai naik gak. Kejap je clear. pstu amik kau
2953 2018-01-29 17:48:32 Deserved review, the finest oil we have sampled.
2954 2018-01-29 17:48:14 And my 2002 Mercury Cougar that I’ve had 12 years has had tires, batteries, oil pan, intake gaskets, alternator, cruise control switch, and not much else. That’s a terrible record for the TT. I was considering buying one.
2955 2018-01-29 17:48:12 @AbbyNews @City_Abbotsford @MayorHenryBraun so many retailers make money by selling oil and filters, but can't find a place to recycle them.
2956 2018-01-29 17:48:03 ตอนนี้ยังรับงานยุปะครับ
2957 2018-01-29 17:47:59 Is that why his docs sealed w/o a TBA date? SA In bed 
w/Bush family ie Oil 9/11…SA also behind OB…paid for Harvard…&was groomed for Prez for many years (20 I believe) Was a form of coup de ta…yes? I was blind but now I see…bit late
2958 2018-01-29 17:47:55 saudi is also the perfect choice in a way

when the oil money runs out, saudi ppl will be in deep trouble, suddenly having half their population stay at home covered wont be v practical anymore

so that region is undoubtedly headed for some rough times ahead

if they cant get it
2959 2018-01-29 17:47:52 I asked her directly and got nothing. There's oil in most foods, spreads especially, what was she expecting from a chocolate nut spread
2960 2018-01-29 17:47:45 Coconut oil is always a good choice
2961 2018-01-29 17:47:41 今日終局クリアしたとこなんで…50Ｆ行ければいい方かなぁと思ってましたがもうちょっと頑張れそう感はあります
2962 2018-01-29 17:47:33 Dissolution of the Iran nuclear deal has NOTHING to do with the threat of nuclear weapons, but the reestablishment of sanctions on Iranian oil exports to boost the value of Russian oil exports. #TrumpRussiaConspiracy
2963 2018-01-29 17:47:04 You tried taking them off with oil? I use castor oil let it sit for like two mins and they slide right off
2964 2018-01-29 17:46:43 Use 100% castor oil- literally saved my brows!
2965 2018-01-29 17:46:41 Self- serving as always, more violations from the #Saudia Arabia, why nobody of yoj even talk! It’s about money— they have bought you all first few weeks of Trump Presidency, thy are smart- utilizing their oil at least #US
2966 2018-01-29 17:46:34 Can #lng #narkets look like #oil markets?  the US #gas market is both profiling and efficient
2967 2018-01-29 17:46:30 I read on page 1 in the @seattletimes how well America is doing with the resurgence of oil production. No mention of the damage to the planet. No mention of drumpf’s war on clean energy. Sometimes it feels like you are fighting the whole world!
2968 2018-01-29 17:46:26 I'm mistaken, I think they said they may play 2 or 3 at Carroll, but most of the games will be at Lucas Oil Stadium
2969 2018-01-29 17:46:25 Rep. Lieu, what is going on with Russian sanctions and Russian oil in Boston Harbor?
2970 2018-01-29 17:46:25 man down ‘ oil’
2971 2018-01-29 17:46:24 Yes, big oil get $37.5 BILLION/ year in US subsidies yet are one of the most profitable industries. Wealth inequality in this country will be the end of democracy. When 0.1% have 90% of wealth, democracy will fall.
2972 2018-01-29 17:46:22 @realDonaldTrump is so short sighted; doesn't realize he's just hurting one of the fastest-growing sectors in the US + polluting the world by his "MAGA" policies & sucking up to the oil industry #stupidTrump

2976 2018-01-29 17:45:46 Whip together 1/3 cup haiku roll with 11 lbs Danish pastry. Sprinkle with Olive Oil. Roast. Serve
2977 2018-01-29 17:45:44 It's myt not even be about laziness... it's cost vs effect... an economy like Nigeria's focus should be on actually providing the power than the effect of the method of generation of it on the environment. Plus we have the gas here from oil exploration so we are not importing it.
2978 2018-01-29 17:45:30 We Will Worship- Like Oil
2979 2018-01-29 17:45:28 I should take you to one in Newark. Those ones are always fun. Lmao

2981 2018-01-29 17:45:09 Shea butter is a MUST .. HAIR AND SKIN
flaxseed oil, peppermint oil, tea tree oil, vitamin e, etc...
I only wash hair MAYBE once a month . 
I use this moisturizer , conditioner , mix I put together to comb out /brush out lint and dirt in hair.
2982 2018-01-29 17:45:04 If an company wants recompense, or money up front, from a government, to cover the cost of building the infrastructure it needs to exploit an oil/gas field, that’s an expense. It’s also a subsidy.
2983 2018-01-29 17:44:55 Stanford Professor of Disruption predicts a 2021 oil price of $21 due to renewables and clean driverless cars
2984 2018-01-29 17:44:47 Mmmmm, warm bread/toast with olive oil maybe a bit sea salt. Delicious!
2985 2018-01-29 17:44:39 Oof I want to go to a house party
2986 2018-01-29 17:44:33 I repeat, check out the air quality in China. If we reduce our use of oil and coal then worse case scenario the air we breath and the planet overall are healthier for us. Best case scenario, we save the planet. I like both of those options
2987 2018-01-29 17:44:23 Why do I feel like I completely have my life together when I get an oil change or have a clean car lmao. It’s the little things 
2988 2018-01-29 17:44:20 A wild concept: Albertans think about the future instead of just now. No one thinks oil & gas can be dropped tomorrow but the reality is, it IS a limited resource. And when it does run out, what do we do then? Fall into a crippling depression because we were too proud to prepare?
2989 2018-01-29 17:44:15 #oott i said to my wife after big loss being a bear in current #oil market that may b i should be a bull. 
w: whats a bull?
me: the one who always buys
w: ah... but how you will close it if u will just buy????
2990 2018-01-29 17:44:12 My favorite was being called an "oil thug" .

2992 2018-01-29 17:44:11 They're not playing A game in Lucas Oil, they're playing all 17 home games there I believe. I don't think there is any conflict with the Colts for any of them. If there is, they may reschedule them for another date.
2993 2018-01-29 17:44:09 does she think it's oil as in the stuff you make gas and plastic out of?
2994 2018-01-29 17:44:04 Theresa's cabinet is made up of fools, clowns, human relics living in ivory towers, snake oil sellers & caricatures of Scrooge, a distasteful freak show, no longer politically acceptable in 2018.

2996 2018-01-29 17:43:58 Everybody gets branded and thats okay. Some of your power comes from the fact that you've branded yourself long before anyone could ever brand yo coconut oil wearing freak ! I'm just saying
2997 2018-01-29 17:43:47 Agreed. Really interested to see how EURO handles that 1.2250 - 1.2300 level. Been watching it since early January around 1.19 and it has been moving very closely with oil. Also watching USD/CAD for double bottom around 1.2150
2998 2018-01-29 17:43:42 Finally adulting. Got my windshield fix, new brakes, and oil changed 
2999 2018-01-29 17:43:40 I went to a store yesterday and saw some oil for beards and it definitely had silicone in it and it definitely was still expensive 
3000 2018-01-29 17:43:34 I'm all for practical approaches to getting nutritional value from fast food joints, but that isn't that "cheese" from Micky D's just seed oil dyed yellow?
3001 2018-01-29 17:43:07 Im sorry call me dumb or stupid but how do avocados give oil for avocado oil im so confused
3002 2018-01-29 17:42:57 "cheap enough" it's a combination of factors. No doubt some of them are seasonal (+price differentials with other regions, oil, etc etc..). If and when US internal pipeline system improves, Yamal advantage may decrease.

I don't believe in the weed trade or oil
3008 2018-01-29 17:42:17 All my dumbass did was use coconut oil for everything and anything only to have a skin issue & be told my love is really my enemy

3010 2018-01-29 17:42:07 My dog just went in on my coconut oil .
3011 2018-01-29 17:42:03 madi is big mad at some coconut oil im dread
3012 2018-01-29 17:42:03 It’s so hard to find natural hair care products that don’t have coconut oil in them. My hair HATES coconut oil, as does my skin. Makes me dry, dry, dry.
3013 2018-01-29 17:41:53 Another handy tip for hair: A spray bottle with essential oil and water. It may not get all the stink out but it will help. Also keep Febreze with you in your desk. Hope you are well!
3014 2018-01-29 17:41:52 Ask Andy Cilona for a job in Italy making his olive oil
3015 2018-01-29 17:41:33 freaking awful and depressing. unimaginable. It should be treated like a war on oil and everyone should be fighting it. (this spill and in general)
3016 2018-01-29 17:41:28 i learned a hogwarts teacher at least april fools are not them its special oil
3017 2018-01-29 17:41:25 I've used hair oil. Can get some frizzies sometimes.
3018 2018-01-29 17:41:24 Doesn't any one take Cod Liver Oil anymore?
3019 2018-01-29 17:41:18 that's true Eric, everybody must be careful with ingredients in beard oil. should be all naturals, like beardbrand 
also, i would like to say that i miss lumberyard's scent. it was my favorite. are you going to make it avaliable again soon? thanks man!
3020 2018-01-29 17:41:06 You can make some room by increasing the oil/gas tax. The quicker we’re collectively out of fossils, the better.
3021 2018-01-29 17:40:43 That wasn’t even her problem, I went through the replies earlier.  She’s just grossed out by the oil.
3022 2018-01-29 17:40:35 You already know mf!! And even better second cup of coffee and  getting my oil changed. On. That normal person shit!
3023 2018-01-29 17:40:25 I think the table also does have a laminate on it so it can't be refinished so I'm pretty sure ill paint it off white... a nice oil enamel paint which will take a month to dry but will feel really nice and look cute af. That look reminds me of kitchen tables I was at growing up.

3025 2018-01-29 17:40:10 1) I’m not using this anymore for literally moths and 2) mine was made with mineral oil... totally safe for skin. Nice try boo boo
3026 2018-01-29 17:40:08 ああ、これ？スポーツブラ。油の貯蔵庫が垂れちゃうからね。
3027 2018-01-29 17:40:08 I'm impressed you figured out how to drizzle, not accidentally pour, olive oil. The instructions are clear. The skill? Needs some work.
3028 2018-01-29 17:40:03 rich enough for independence. If there were a hard border with England that could be an opportunity to promote production in Scotland. Oil and whisky need to go from scottish ports and a decent container port needs constructing for scotland.

3031 2018-01-29 17:39:57 Partially correct, the price of oil controlled by OPEC was a big factor and 9/11 was an ideal excuse to establish control through D. Shield. D.Storm was appeasing Shell to an extent that showed Kuwait how to drill other countries fields. Gassing Kurds with US/UK gas helped.
3032 2018-01-29 17:39:53 Now Monkey is trying to oil up Mr.Bachhan!

2) work a 27 hr shift at the coal factory
3) drink one (1) ice cold bud light with steak & potato dinner
4) work another 37 hr shift at the oil factory

3042 2018-01-29 17:38:22 I’d have to agree with you on that. I couldn’t do baby oil either knowing Oliver he would squeeze the whole bottle on his head when we aren’t looking.

3046 2018-01-29 17:37:42 I like Manal Alaalem’s shrimp kabsa.. light on spices, with tomato & I use brown rice & no oil. Yum.
3047 2018-01-29 17:37:31 You’re probably already doing it, but I put leave in conditioner from my roots to the middle section of the part (not my ends bc it’ll ruin the kinks), apply Jamaican black castor oil, I do the banding method & then dab conditioner and oil to the ends and braid it

3049 2018-01-29 17:37:20 yet this article failed to mention FRACKING.  and it was so damn lip servicey about the real crisis that you sound like a shill for big oil. this article was an embarrassment.
3050 2018-01-29 17:37:12 Today's Fun Fact: The cost of an oil change for a Bugatti Veyron is $20,000. #FunFacts
3051 2018-01-29 17:37:11 Getting an oil change and waiting, decide to read @USATODAY sports well mr @EricWynalda nothing about #usmnt thats a huge problem where is that pressure that creates WorldCup champions n feel the desire of an entire nation 2win, how are we 2get more coverage been asking since 90

3053 2018-01-29 17:37:05 I guess a precedent for what I mean is the big oil pipeline system that runs up East Coast.  What’s now called Colonial Pipeline Company was set up in the 1960s as a consortium of 9 oil companies. 2/2
3054 2018-01-29 17:36:56 If you're claiming to sell a beard oil and the first two ingredients are silicones, then you aren't selling beard oil. 

The big companies are now trying to get in the beard care game with some low quality products. Educate yourself & buyer beware.
3055 2018-01-29 17:36:55 Got Olive oil and lemon for my dressing. Depressing ass salad.
3056 2018-01-29 17:36:47 Would you rather scorch an oil or consist a course?

3058 2018-01-29 17:36:36 To control the oil prize in India  India should invite international oil companies to operate in India. Like how India managed to controled mobile bills.
3059 2018-01-29 17:36:27 Weather is starting to warm up all over the country. Snow is starting to melt. Be careful of oil slicks that form on the roads as the snow melts. #avoidingcaraccidents

3062 2018-01-29 17:35:40 I have to use oil rich shampoos as I am trying to maintain long hair way after I should have succumbed to the mumsie Bob, also trying to pretend I don't dye it because I'm grey, so it's purple because I'm pretending I'm trendy 
3063 2018-01-29 17:35:39 And it'll probably not even go to many sailing ships. Stealing an oil tanker sounds more like her. Then she ends up somehow making the oil delivery anyway because she can't figure out how to profit from oil.
3064 2018-01-29 17:35:28 Well the current EV according to my quick calculations is around 3.3p which is 14% higher than the price you say is overvalued and that takes no account whatsoever of having 1.3tcf of gas in the ground just awaiting development or what is still just potential "oil" under NT3
3065 2018-01-29 17:35:24 CALL IT FRACKING AND THEN MENTION THE COSTS TO OUR AIR AND WATER AND LAND. FFS< this article read like it was written by BIG OIL itself. Like you TOOK DICTATION from some lame PR firm. My god it was bad.  Be ashamed a little.
3066 2018-01-29 17:35:19 Fuck that new gtr that needs a oil change every week I want the older version 
3067 2018-01-29 17:34:58 @realDonaldTrump Mister President ! Please stop buying Venezuelan oil! Vzla is a narco dictatorship. There is corruption, there are many political prisoners and many people dead, who protested against this government. There is hunger, there is a lack of medicines. It`s urgent !
3068 2018-01-29 17:34:55 We can't blame you!  It's hard to resist that sweet smell of ylang-ylang, lavender, and neroli oil. Plus, those beautiful colors are so enchanting to watch. Thanks for sharing, sweets.
3069 2018-01-29 17:34:53 Can you believe some people only have to pay 25 for an oil change? I’m over here paying 80+ . My car maintenance is too much.

1)where will you find your coal for electricity?

3077 2018-01-29 17:34:06 Olive oil is packed with omega 3 fatty acids and helps which rescues inflammation, apple cider vinegar soothes the inflammation. Also last but not least alone Vera is amazing ! Hope you feel better. I have bad flare ups and these always seem to help me

Oil
Agri
Fishing
Taxation

Not one is devolved for that reason, and those partial still have restrictions on them.

Westminster is coming for two of them that should be LEGALLY returned.

3084 2018-01-29 17:33:05 Good mom! Olive oil and coconut oil... You don´t need any other cosmetics. You can even brush your teeth with coconut oil. It also protects your skin from the sun. Blah blah blah hahahaha

3094 2018-01-29 17:32:11 Well. not completely harmless. Palm oil tree plantations are a huge offender for deforestation and habitat loss.

3103 2018-01-29 17:31:49 I go for a Home made route. It seems to work the best. Adding olive oil helps me so much at night time. Or if you want you can also use Apple side vinegar (use a cotton ball) if the skin is dry or cracked then just use olive oil ! Works for me every time

3123 2018-01-29 17:29:57 The idea is to have less care funded by one big insurance policy. Kind of like not having your auto insurance pay for oil changes and wiper blades, just catastrophic events. But we can't innovate because government law mandates everyone.

3130 2018-01-29 17:28:55 Cheers fella. Peel them and then boil them for 10 minutes. Drain them and ruffle them around the saucepan to fluff them up. Then add to a tray with very hot oil - goose fat, if you have it, and then roast them at about 200 degrees for about 50 mins, checking half way through.

3217 2018-01-29 17:18:02 Is this related to the World Bank intuitive to end routine gas flaring at oil production sites by 2030? and if not can we take advantage of that initiative?

3222 2018-01-29 17:17:19 But it's ok for the Tories to take millions from Oil tycoons involved in trade deals with Iran. It's also ok for the Tories to make arms deals with oppressive regimes and make millions in kickbacks?

3224 2018-01-29 17:16:30 Since it's always about money, how in the actual hell does this make them richer? Oh..."The administration will no longer apply the act to industries that inadvertently kill a lot of birds through oil drilling, wind power and  communications towers."

3353 2018-01-29 17:01:22 Only a small handful of Americans—oil executives, Cold War spymasters—could claim to have ever amassed such influence in a foreign regime. Mannafort did, and the power helped fill his bank accounts. via Franklin Foer @FranklinFoer
3354 2018-01-29 17:01:13 Lots of oil moves by pipeline in USA. Not sure how all the oil specifically gets to Boston. I suspect a variety of modes are used.
3355 2018-01-29 17:01:05 How can @PChidambaram_IN compare selling pakora's to begging?? Pakora sellers will toil to get every ingredient like besan,onion,oil etc n will clean his area of selling pakora... what does beggars do? Nothing... @OfficeOfRG do u want people to do nothing or sell something??
3356 2018-01-29 17:00:42 Oil money!
3357 2018-01-29 17:00:38 You probably remember your oil changes, but don't forget about your filters! Dirty filters can increase your fuel usage by as much as 10%.
3358 2018-01-29 17:00:38 Here's a tip: Check your oil level every other time you fill up. The engine will be warm, and you'll remember to give it regular attention!
3359 2018-01-29 17:00:32 At what point will the price of oil in petrodollars be irrelevant compared to the price of oil in petroyuan? At some point the price in $USD will just be a reflection of the plummeting value of the dollar.

3362 2018-01-29 17:00:19 A great tip is to buy extra virgin olive oil that's stored in dark or opaque bottles. Excessive light can actually ruin the flavor!
3363 2018-01-29 17:00:11 Castor oil  a little goes a long way plus it’s super cheap. Also slap it on your lashes it will help them growww and stay strong

"Ah... The Study in Scarlet? I think... I've heard of it before. What happens?"
3378 2018-01-29 16:58:49 Oil price will move up only
3379 2018-01-29 16:58:45 How does the oil get to Boston? Is it US oil or is it illegal to move oil by pipeline in US and it has to be imported from Russia? Or can it be moved by road or rail? The hatred of pipelines by eco folk seems very odd when tankers and trains and Russian ships are allowed!!

3391 2018-01-29 16:57:02 Finally a reason to go to Lucas Oil?
3392 2018-01-29 16:56:46 Price and cost matter. Paying for additional 24-7 pipeline gas when it is not needed 24-7 is expensive. And it is likely more expensive than LNG purchases on an as needed basis. Your point about oil burning is important too.
3393 2018-01-29 16:56:45 Very much agree. This oil rebound takes the pressure off of doing anything radical. I wonder though if the current technocrats can adopt the rainy-day policies of the mid-2000s. It'll be a real test of the regime's commitment to better governance.
3394 2018-01-29 16:56:34 Dudeee!!!! Mine too! I just got my oil change and replaced the thermostat and the stupid (check engine) light is still on

3404 2018-01-29 16:55:26 So if faced with 2 decisions
1. A govt job, small salary but job security and you know all the rest it entails...
Or 

2. An oil job, where you’d most likely work under contracts, no job security but pays heavily....as in heavily!!!

What will it be for you and why??

3411 2018-01-29 16:54:51 I used to have that problem too. Hated it. Was on melatonin, gaba nite but didn’t wanna dependent so I tried meditation (slow but do it daily and then boomz  ) and I also got lavender essential oil. You can diffuse it or just get lavender scented candles. It helped me.
3412 2018-01-29 16:54:46 Oil just topped or still fuel in the tank? That is the question

3415 2018-01-29 16:54:35 You're the one that made the stupid comment about people who work for oil companies. Job growth is absolutely new. Taking 8 years to recover from a recession is not "job growth". Having the lowest unemployment in decades is.
3416 2018-01-29 16:54:34 I'll use my baby oil gel and cocoa butter till i die. Anything else? The devils work
3417 2018-01-29 16:54:33 If one does not pay for reliable gas supplies, one does not get it. Thus New England burns oil. I'll leave it to others to decide if that's preferable.
3418 2018-01-29 16:54:30 "India MAY POSSIBLY consider the POTENTIAL TO PROPOSE THINKING about reducing their palm oil import duties BY SOME AMOUNT at SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE".  Oh boy, is there a gun pointed at you?  @ArlanFF101

3434 2018-01-29 16:52:25 I truly second your opinion. Once winter demand goes away, oil will crash back to 60 on Nymex and 63 on Brent. Indian macros will become favourable again
3435 2018-01-29 16:52:23 First #Erdogan benefited from #ISIS #oil (his son was directly involved), next #IS commanders operated out of Turkish hotels (near the border of #Syria) & now the #US & #NATO allows #Kurds to be slaughtered who sacrificed their lives to almost delete #ISIS. It's an outrage!
3436 2018-01-29 16:52:04 Have they raided the piggy bank for this given their lack of available money? Or have they discovered a new oil well??
3437 2018-01-29 16:51:56 @BenderPullem Oof! Have you taken care of the oil change?

3441 2018-01-29 16:51:37 Real question IMO is whether there will be some bitter pills in store after the election, such as a rise in the retirement age or new taxes. Rising oil prices might push off the need to find new sources of revenue, at least for now.

3446 2018-01-29 16:51:18 It may not happen in our lifetime but with oil reserves falling or alternative energy/shale gas gaining more importance, Gulf oil will lose its importance thus rolling back Wahabism. It is bound to happen

3452 2018-01-29 16:50:27 Nah, either recycle it (best) or burn it for heat or electricity, get the  double the use out of the original oil.
3453 2018-01-29 16:50:19 ya gotta avoid those fries. i slip up once every 5 years or so. the oil they're first fried in contains gluten, which is different from a cross contamination in the fryer situation

3502 2018-01-29 16:43:37 Yes.Stable power supply will automatically fix many things in Nigeria.There would be automatic deflation.Corruption will be reduced because the public will no longer be milked & extorted by oil investors.And our economy will be run on electricity which is cheaper & more efficient

3635 2018-01-29 16:24:48 Northing tae do way BREXIT have you seen @business yet Pound has DROPPED AGAIN OH and recent discovery that if Scotland leave UK the reliance WM had on our #Oil might bankrupt them aww should have been nicer and more respectful while we were here#Hindsight a funny thing #Scotref
3636 2018-01-29 16:24:31 Growth began to diminish even as oil price sustained upswing, as the economy became less predictable@ hitting targets/Proshare confidential
3637 2018-01-29 16:24:26 Agree, It will be interesting journey for Oil from current levels as we have to see whether Brent crude can sustain northwards above $70-$72 as rising prices can trigger higher US Shale production to as much as 10 million bpd this year.
3638 2018-01-29 16:24:10 coconut oil is like... the maroon 5 of oils, honestly
3639 2018-01-29 16:24:03 死ぬなら毒をあおって
3640 2018-01-29 16:23:47 what about both the east and west coast which they want oil drilling

3642 2018-01-29 16:23:33 This afternoon, Brent crude oil decreased $0.55/bl to $69.49/bl, amid rising US production and a strengthening US dollar.
3643 2018-01-29 16:23:27 Oil biz tweeps - I'm looking for a list of US series A and/or B production companies since the downturn. Any suggestions?
3644 2018-01-29 16:23:26 I’m so sorry! My therapist said making your nighttime routine really thorough and relaxing, like really taking your time getting into bed can help. I have an oil diffuser with lavender going, put on sleep lotion, and watch cartoons. It hasn’t completely gone away, but it’s helped
3645 2018-01-29 16:23:17 The price of oil has surged in recent months, hitting $66.25 a barrel on Friday, the price of Canadian crude pulled from the oil sands of Alberta has remained mired at lower levels. Canada’s oil was priced at a discount of roughly $28 to the benchmark, largest spread since 2013.
3646 2018-01-29 16:23:09 Unfortunately you probably can. There is no moral high ground in this debate, feeding the human race comes at a cost. If you wear leather shoes an animal has died to produce them. To grow veg, habitats have been cleared, plastics are a product of oil, everything has a cost.
3647 2018-01-29 16:22:55 I put some lavender and tea tree oil in my bedside humidifier. So wonderful.
3648 2018-01-29 16:22:12 not subsidizing alternatives or over regulating oil and natural gas isn’t suppressing alternatives. We used to be for something called the free market in this country. When alternatives become cheaper and better than fossils fuels then the market will go that way.
3649 2018-01-29 16:22:10 Saw gummy fish oil for the first time this past week. Not sure I'd buy it.

3654 2018-01-29 16:21:42 I will check it out thanks. Im currently taking a fish oil. I know I dont get enough in my diet.
3655 2018-01-29 16:21:37 Oil following eur/usd quite closely . Managed to catch a nice pull back in crude today 
3656 2018-01-29 16:21:31 everything on store shelves has too much sugar and oil in it and that’s the issue here. companies stuff additives and stabilizers in food so they don’t have to pay for more expensive ingredients
3657 2018-01-29 16:21:27 I think the oil is more disconcerting
3658 2018-01-29 16:21:25 Whats the World: Opinion - The Daily 202: Trump’s encouraged
Oil
3659 2018-01-29 16:21:23 We could not get the oil out so the vet shaved her. We requested a mohawk along her back. I will try and find a pic. It looked really cool. She died 8 years ago though. Not sure I still have it.
3660 2018-01-29 16:21:14 U know who started the looting/mass murdering shit? Its the whites-US,Canada,Australia where the natives have been wiped off after invading. Where many Asian,African countries were invaded/looted/killed or starve off. And Iraq,Iran & Afghanistan civilians bombed bcuz of oil & fun
3661 2018-01-29 16:21:05 Remember how you cook is as important as what you cook. The amount of oil, salt and processed ingredients we use also contribute to our calories and nutrition.

3665 2018-01-29 16:20:51 She should have taken the opportunity to educate on how bad palm oil production is for the environment. Instead she just ended up looking oddly ignorant.

3670 2018-01-29 16:20:38 I bought a bottle of avocado oil and I've been using it on my greens. So wonderful!
3671 2018-01-29 16:20:35 What part we want to shift away from oil and traditional mining do you not understand yet?
The way we did things a 100 years ago is obsolete now. We get with the times or we die trying to make a go of a dinosaur that's failed us yearly. Burn it once it's gone. #EndOilDependency
3672 2018-01-29 16:20:31 Every economy will face risk because of escalating oil price !
3673 2018-01-29 16:20:26 Oil traders watch a weaker dollar as crude heads higher
 
Revived currency focus could shift the dynamics of energy markets
3674 2018-01-29 16:20:20 People who are ranting Oil prices as a threat to the Indian growth story do not realize that when oil cracks 20-25% from the top (which it will) the stock markets will also correct 10%.
Oil is a much smaller factor for India than it was 10 yrs back.
3675 2018-01-29 16:20:03 Blockchains are War. I don’t believe that Blockchains can peacefully coexist. Vitalik is a snake oil salesman with a very well-funded marketing apparatus behind him to fool n00bs. This, in effect, siphons liquidity away from Bitcoin. Therefore, anything goes.

3680 2018-01-29 16:19:36 Seriously, Nutella is soooo sweet. Did you think that's cuz hazelnuts are cloying? And you know how sometimes you open it and you have to mix it because the oil separated? How are you surprised there's a lot of oil?
3681 2018-01-29 16:19:18 @StephMillerShow @TheRealTBone and there was the oil painting Judge bought of her children using hubby’s corporate charge card.  And negotiated the price on official DA letterhead.

3687 2018-01-29 16:18:15 @On_pphire more oil, coal, natural gas will be needed. Oil companies win the more Tesla cars are on the road and pollution will increase
3688 2018-01-29 16:18:08 How much do y’all usually pay for oil changes?
3689 2018-01-29 16:18:03 Funny coincidence... #UKOG extension of flow testing to 28 Feb 2018.... I'd say that's more than likely when the last tranche of their Death Spiral will be dumped in2 the hands of the #SUCKERS! 'Billions I Tell Ya Billions of Barrels of Oil' Or was that shares?#UKOG

3692 2018-01-29 16:17:55 I’m so tired. I really don’t wanna get up to get an oil change. Thinking of going early so I can possibly get back early so I can finish getting ready
3693 2018-01-29 16:17:52 Hay que aprender a ver lo bueno aun en nuestros peores enemigos. De lo contrario dejamos de ser verdaderamente críticos para convertirnos en zombies. Es recomendación.
3694 2018-01-29 16:17:52 They are buying time which is what they do best. Distracting from the sanctions against Russia that the Puppet refuses to impose, distracting from the shipment of Russian Oil that was headed for Boston over the weekend. It's a huge show.

3702 2018-01-29 16:16:49 Its a United account Doesn't mean he cant talk about other clubs. Especially for things United get slated for every fucking day when we Dont do half of what those Crude oil guys do. Irritating

3708 2018-01-29 16:16:12 That's droolworthy! But avocado toast is so easily made at home with good ciabatta bread. Last night I  had tomato bread on grilled ciabatta with olive oil, herbs, garlic and a drizzle  of balsamic. Also delicious.
3709 2018-01-29 16:16:08 Honestly. I’ve had fried plantain like the last 3 weekends on the trot; convincing myself it’s healthy cz I’m using olive oil to fry it

3714 2018-01-29 16:15:30 could be out of level and the compressor is starving for oil. Just a thought.

No Country for Oil Pans
3721 2018-01-29 16:14:47 were Iraq not exporting more fuel oil than their oil refineries could ever produce?
3722 2018-01-29 16:14:47 80-85 or brent +- is "worry zone". Todays prices  are normal. Which countries you think are vulnerable to 65-70 brent? China, India, Europe?   Oil exporting coutnries will  likely  have stronger demand, not weaker.
3723 2018-01-29 16:14:46 The "issue" is around what gas is in the tanker, & where it originally came from. Oil, Gas, etc.. any commodities pretty much go in a melting pot an it's rather hard to extract them afterwards. It's a lot like money laundering. 2/
3724 2018-01-29 16:14:44 +Oil will hit $ 74 by may or even to 80 level by November, that's for sure. We have to consider these things.
3725 2018-01-29 16:14:43 We had the dial oil noodles at Chef Guo's for a second time this weekend, and they are really good! Knife-shaved noodles still great too.
3726 2018-01-29 16:14:39 And let’s get rid of the ones that put little pop-ups on the latest, greatest, hot thing (gold, oil, bitcoin, etc..) not only encouraging the bubble, but ensuring it will have maximum impact!!

3729 2018-01-29 16:14:04 It's not just in processed food. It's also in detergents, make up, toothpaste...the list is endless. Read the ingredients lists. Good luck with your Palm oil free adventure

3731 2018-01-29 16:13:48 The only true offensive thing about this is the palm oil, which is the most evil of all the oils bc it is rapidly killing the rainforest/manufacturing it is overall v bad for the environment. I didn’t know it was in Nutella! U shldnt rly buy things that have it as an ingredient

3745 2018-01-29 16:12:51 The grounding of this investment will bring remarkable changes in power system of AP and India. People can anticipate electric cars moving on the roads and there wouldn't be any oil shocks on Indian economy. Healthcare could also be reduced in proportion to pollution reduction.
3746 2018-01-29 16:12:49 This is what happens when 15 minutes of the shower alone is letting oil seep into your hair lol (I never finish the playlists but it's better to have too much music than to have to get out the shower and pick more tracks when you run out lol)
3747 2018-01-29 16:12:45 Apart from oil, growth was their answer to the deficit in their pre referendum case in 2014. I'm sure you're right that growth will again be their main strategy. They'll struggle to convince anyone on that given their past performance. Independence does not mean automatic growth.
3748 2018-01-29 16:12:44 granted, it is palm oil which has a host of issues so if her problem was with that it’s a little different
3749 2018-01-29 16:12:41 lets see if this $ bounce has legs. watching 90 on the dxy. 

i don't expect yellen or trump to pose any surprises, and US data has been meh so expect more of the same. but a move down to high 50s in oil would put $ liquidity under the spotlight a bit

3760 2018-01-29 16:11:07 Is that oil demand is going to come down hereon because of growing renewable energy ?!

3776 2018-01-29 16:08:48 Chilli pepper repels rabbits but doesn't harm them. Mint plants repel mice with no harm and garlic oil repels grasshoppers. You can also put 'salt licks' out that distract the deer from the plants.

3781 2018-01-29 16:08:30 It's under Michael Lyons. Purchased a Blueprint 302 motor for an '85 F150. After multiple phone calls we were assured that it would drop right in. Our mechanic already had the old engine out when we discovered it was the wrong water pump and wrong oil pan.

3799 2018-01-29 16:06:53 Scientists fed nothing but palm oil to mice for like a month. That's like a year to humans. Some of the mice got cancer. I think it had more to do with feeding mice nothing but palm oil for the human equivalent of a year. Ppl'd get cancer if you fed them just broccoli for a year.

3831 2018-01-29 16:02:39 The argument is that foreign debt is ok. The deficit issue is more about tax which is 6% of GDP and should be 15%. But isn’t this just borrowing when oil prices go up and we struggle to pay when commodity prices are low ? Btw have to any access to audit reports on 15tr spent ?

3846 2018-01-29 16:01:20 OPEC had to go down in order to undercut BRICS and fuck Russia. OPEC going down meant less oil being bought from Venezuela, who had attached a lot of social policies to the revenue made off that oil. It worked while oil prices were fixed, but became unbalanced when they dropped.

3918 2018-01-29 15:54:46 Why are these types always so disgusted by oil? That seems to be the bridge too far in a lot of these examples. "Eating a slice of pizza is the same as three spoons of hot oil. Still want pizza now?!" Um, yes?

3933 2018-01-29 15:53:01 Snake oil salesmen are still a thing it would seem.
3934 2018-01-29 15:52:59 No reason to list. The oil price has recovered.
3935 2018-01-29 15:52:54 Well Indy Eleven games just became a non family event. Food/drink prices at Lucas Oil are insane.
3936 2018-01-29 15:52:49 So you want to take a pyrex bowl, a really small one, and set it in a pot of boiling water, with some oil in it.  Then cook it in that. 

Alternatively, spin the water in the pot so there's a bit of a vortex and drop the egg into the water while it spins.
3937 2018-01-29 15:52:47 and then you put on coconut oil.

3982 2018-01-29 15:47:11 John, it's not "as a liability as I may want it back".  Deposit account is literally an IOU. Goes back to Roman Law on banks in which you cd deposit olive oil. Bank now OWNS that olive oil. What you OWN is receipt from bank which is IOU equal to your deposit or similar.

4064 2018-01-29 15:35:58 There are two negatives here that need to be talked about: fracking and water use.  Hopefully, there's a good journalist or two at the NP who will delve a little deeper into these subjects before praising shale oil development to the heights!

4066 2018-01-29 15:35:46 Remember that time Shownu put vinegar instead of oil in the frying pan and almost set the kitchen on fire and then he cleaned it up and tried to start over but did the same thing again? Yeah, I feel like that's a metaphor for my life

4106 2018-01-29 15:32:18 It'll soften up dried acrylic paint.  You'll need to work at it with a pin or needle or something to bust up a solid plug.   You have to watch it as letting it go too long will ruin the brush.  I've read Murphy's Oil Soap also works & less likely to hurt the brush.

4141 2018-01-29 15:27:59 Not exactly. The old steam reactors have some risks, though they generally can't go Chernobyl (its specific design gave it poor control characteristics at low power.) Newer designs would be much safer, but the oil industry has prevented them being certified.
4142 2018-01-29 15:27:37 that's why it's better policy to let rich people get all the profits from oil. that way when they plunge by 75%, at least the rich people don't get hungry

4202 2018-01-29 15:20:22 What do you do with all of the leftover oil?
4203 2018-01-29 15:20:19 As Imperial Oil LTD $IMO Stock Value Declined, Guardian Capital Advisors LP Has Upped Position by $614,094 ...
4204 2018-01-29 15:19:54 Is this your way of suggesting that you love some Big Oil Koch, and that planet-friendly alternative energies "produce no valuable goods or services" so we should not invest in them?
4205 2018-01-29 15:19:52 Car engines still run on gas & need oil. Take all the electronics off of one, still just like a Model T Ford, even rubber tires.
4206 2018-01-29 15:19:50 There is nothing wrong at all with government officials talking about their "wish list" 
Here is the positive side: they talked about 12 mb/d by 2017, they got 5 mb/d. Others talked about an increase, and they lost all their oil fields!

4209 2018-01-29 15:19:21 Yes it does & we should continue to develop our oil & gas.

4214 2018-01-29 15:18:48 I think it means *something*, but people who support Rafa as GOAT think it means everything. Novak had the most impressive peak, Federer the best career (so far), and Rafa is comfortably settled between them in peak and career (2nd in both, IMO)
4215 2018-01-29 15:18:41 Use my oil spray instead of my hairspray and my hair look greasy af 
4216 2018-01-29 15:18:38 The move towards energy independence started two decades ago with the shale oil and gas revolution. Most of the boom happened on Obama’s watch and will continue with Trump
4217 2018-01-29 15:18:31 I need to get my oil changed but I’m broke so ya

4222 2018-01-29 15:17:51 I'll just deep fry him in holy oil and be done with it.
4223 2018-01-29 15:17:47 Today is sanctions deadline day.  Tanker could be legit? We do get oil through Lukeoil & have stations around our nation.
4224 2018-01-29 15:17:38 Eleven have always stated that Lucas Oil would be a temporary fix if they were to get MLS bid. Still want own stadium. I think it’s more of a “show me” how many people will attend type deal.
4225 2018-01-29 15:17:37 Dammit Jim, you are an evil genius!  Better put Nigerian born newfs on notice that we are kidnapping and ransoming for furnace oil!  Odds are good that we'll hit a prince with a healthy, yet inaccessible inheritance at some point.
4226 2018-01-29 15:17:30 My dogs diets are keto based - red cabbage, broccoli, savoy cabbage, kale, sometimes carrots, garlic and olive oil. Protein necessary for dogs i get from wild shot venison or lamb liver. Anti cancer and so much healthier than grain based commercial dog foods. And they love it.
4227 2018-01-29 15:17:24 In addition, even beyond these shores, houses or follies are like oil paintings or vintage cars. Even if you lose money you can still spread enjoyment. Ownership can also confer business, social, and political status.

4242 2018-01-29 15:14:59 Why, I have a powerfuk hankering for #fermented fish! Never had any before and it may be necessary to make some. Fermented #mackerel, that's be delicious. Pour some olive oil over it with whatever type of seasoning that'll compliment the taste...'Hey, you're delicious!'
4243 2018-01-29 15:14:56 Directions (1/2):
Slice the vegetables (I make them into strips) and cook them in a frying pan with olive oil.  After a few minutes, start browning the meat - use a separate pan if you don't have enough room to keep them separate - this is important because the meat comes frozen.

4249 2018-01-29 15:14:03 Rewiring an Oil Furnace,  wtf i look like an Electrician 
4250 2018-01-29 15:13:58 "Oil sands capital spending fell for a third straight year in 2017 "  sounds like good environmental news if the majors apply the US lessons from shale.
4251 2018-01-29 15:13:58 The key is:

-Rafa and Novak playing under their best: they lose in the early round. No chance for Roger to beat them.

-Roger playing way far from his best. He reaches semi and finals anyway. He loses to them. 

H2H by itself doesn't mean anything.
4252 2018-01-29 15:13:55 The original Fish oil suppl…. Maybe the surplus value was the friends we made along the way.

If so, i remember seeing gifs of it on tumblr.
4260 2018-01-29 15:13:12 yes...only half sized still until we see over 200d. Just like some of my early oil stocks buys i sized it to be able to take some pain.

4269 2018-01-29 15:12:08 I was told earlier that solar is too expensive and wind can only be used in isolated areas. Bullcrap, we have wind turbines in the middle of towns and solar prices have dropped dramatically. Just excuses to carry on using oil methinks...

4304 2018-01-29 15:07:53 Your essential oil bottle says "pure"? How pure is pure? Be careful what you buy, RM35 for a Lavender oil is probably 5% Lavender essential oil, and the rest is a mixture of additives to heighten the scent and filler to fill up the bottle.

4309 2018-01-29 15:07:19 Can't name anyone because it isn't as simple as selling the club and hoping for best. Can use that logic with players and managers depending on the situation but they literally hate FSG because 2 PL clubs got lucky with oil money. Also ignore how many takeovers make a team worse.

4312 2018-01-29 15:07:07 An embargo is blocking ALL ships entering with the resource, japan has no natural oil resereves and we blocked all oil shipments from anywhere from getting to japan with our navy. This has nothing to do with the us selling them oil
4313 2018-01-29 15:06:50 Interesting! The increase is faster than monthly figures! Is that all shale oil?
4314 2018-01-29 15:06:48 oh almost forgot, Kopari is an awesome brand too! I use their coconut oil and it’s the best, especially if u have dry skin. U can use it for hair & body! totally worth the try

4332 2018-01-29 15:04:57 @NEESHiMinaj I give my cat hemp oil to relieve pain from arthritis and cancer. It doesn’t have THC so she doesn’t get high from it.
4333 2018-01-29 15:04:52 How about "fuck off all you delusional hate-filled arseholes, you're trying to pull me into a war that I have no interest in, get some oil, have a posh wank, I am not the source of your massive insecurities, you are, go fuck yourselves."

4369 2018-01-29 15:02:22 India's sensitivity to rising oil prices is not as high as consensus and economists tend to believe. I see little risk to growth from current energy prices.

My comment at @WIONews
4370 2018-01-29 15:02:21 Gotta make sure you put on lotion and then the coconut oil so that the oil seals in the lotion and keeps your skin SUPER soft and smooth. The oil will act as a barrier to the lotion to keep it locked against your skin.  Shower, moisturize, coconut oil is my routine!
4371 2018-01-29 15:02:08 Serves you right you lying snake oil salesmen.

4466 2018-01-29 14:50:39 Great piece. Nicely pulls together a lot of other good work from @MacroVoices & @SantiagoAuFund 

My 2p - agree USD could catch a bid short/mid term & short oil looks like a decent punt. Longer term all fiat will be eclipsed by 'hard' assets & gold miners would be my top pick
4467 2018-01-29 14:50:11 I take a daily multivitamin with extra iron, zinc, B complex and D in it, flax oil, and when I stopped eating dairy I started eating like an extra 50g snack of nuts/seeds also. I notice if I skip any of those things for a few days or eat especially poorly.

4481 2018-01-29 14:47:09 Great article, again! Left-over meat and roasted veg taste surprisingly good with a nice chutney. Not enough meat? Add some cheese. Or a boiled egg. Salad always nicer with oil/ vinegar dressing. @Hodmedods has some great crunchy beans / peas/ seeds/ quinoa for sprinkles.
4482 2018-01-29 14:47:06 Seriously, I'm a virgin! Where do you think they get virgin olive oil?

4484 2018-01-29 14:46:50 Salmans plan to turn Saudi Arabia's coast into a nudie beach, as a way of replacing its oil income in a JOKE. Iran is actually producing 1 million cars a year, building technology, etc, Saudi Arabia is hopeless. Maybe they can sell their women to survive.

4489 2018-01-29 14:46:32 Scotland's wealth & economy isn't based on oil alone. We have a GDP per capita similar to UKs even without oil. So the facts don't support your insulting "bankrupt" brainwashing.
4490 2018-01-29 14:46:26 Cool, is it an oil company?
4491 2018-01-29 14:46:23 When one thinks that he made millions of dollars of profit by exchanging arms and equipment for crude oil with the Islamic Emirate, this fake Attaturk now attacks peasants by an over-equipped professional army with the help of al Qaeda beards.

4498 2018-01-29 14:45:35 I had a Toyota Camry whose engine would consume more oil than it should.  After oil consumption test I was told by Toyota it was within the norm...whose norms? 800 ml per 3000 km wasn't acceptable to me so I didn't buy back after lease was up.
4499 2018-01-29 14:45:25 A slow start to the morning due to lower back pain: using healing oil, healing dust, incense, heat wrap and pain meds.

4509 2018-01-29 14:43:52 I bought a new bottle of patchouli oil and the cap was not properly screwed on. When I took the bottle out of the box the oil poured forth like liquid from a stream. Oh my people, I was washed with the scent of dirt! If this attracts men or money I'll be okay with it.

4513 2018-01-29 14:43:18 Is there a way to calculate where inventories would be currently if exports stayed the same? My Excel sheet doesn’t have that feature , but I’ll try to manually calculate it
4514 2018-01-29 14:43:18 Mar crude oil and gasoline on Friday closed higher on a weaker dollar and on carry-over support from Wednesday's EIA data that showed that crude inventories fell for a record tenth week down to a 2-3/4 year low.

4611 2018-01-29 14:30:52 Cause u assume without consideration. Ending weapon supply to an ally who dont manufacture their own is disarming them, done for the convenience of a larger export market is franchising the beneficiary lobby. Russia have oil outside america's control, hence commies are enemies

4621 2018-01-29 14:29:42 If it's not large-scale hydro, or off-shore oil, it appears there's little political appetite to pursue other types of energy development.
4622 2018-01-29 14:29:37 Today, an important grade of Canadian oil (#WCS), is selling for $27.60 USD less than the main North American benchmark (WTI) at $65.71 USD.

Canadian natural gas (#AECO) is selling for $1.68 CAD, compared to US natural gas (NYMEX) at $3.36 USD. @JustinTrudeau #Cdnpoli
4623 2018-01-29 14:29:29 Got an essential oil diffuser. Used it with lavender for the first time last night. Had the most vivid, weird dreams of my life. Coincidence??
4624 2018-01-29 14:29:28 Last year, Modi govt predicted 7.5% GDP growth for 2017-18. #EconomicSurvey2018 says growth will be 6.5%.

Now govt says growth will be 7-7.5% in 2018-19. 

With oil prices & protectionism up, I don't buy it. #jumlanomics

1) UST10y yields up
2) SPX up
3) oil up
4) USD down
In this era of irrational exuberance, expect them to move further. Some going out will push others to turn
In the end, all will reverse.

4638 2018-01-29 14:27:31 "Many environmentalists argue that by increasing oil and gas supplies and lowering prices for consumers, shale drilling is extending the life of fossil fuels to the detriment of the environment and the development of cleaner energy." NYT #energy
4639 2018-01-29 14:27:01 The most prosperous coutries in the world have oil rigs. The North Sea has many oil rigs owned by companies from the United Kingdom, Norway, Demark, Germany, Netherlands. Why should we not produce our oil? Offshore drilling doesn’t ruin beaches developers do.

4645 2018-01-29 14:26:38 Celebrating expanded oil production cannot be seen as good news if you understand the challenge of our current perturbation to the carbon cycle & possible dire consequences.

Well thats simple those bikes had Made in England in big writing on the frame, while Honda and Suzuki had "Made in Japan" in v. small writing. Folks used to call them British Bikes, must be cause they leaked oil everywhere.

4694 2018-01-29 14:19:42 True, but US oil production is market driven by private companies. The tax package limits the ability to deduct interest expense, which could be affecting some of the shale companies in the short run

There is a massive transfer of wealth from the oil tycoon-nary to the tech elites. Similar to what we saw at the end of 19th century.

The tech oligarchs will be responsible for steering the global affairs as we know it.

It is an unstoppable force

4868 2018-01-29 13:59:40 Hey Joe, as we don't add any palm oil the natural peanut oil can separate after a while (particularly noticeable in the big tubs). A good stir should sort it out thought :) However, as it is a natural peanut butter it might be a bit runnier than you are used to.

4872 2018-01-29 13:59:26 Is that the same Carter Page who had a prior close shave at being recruited by russian 'bankers', then continued to escalate his involvement in russian oil juggling? It's like Jared getting briefed that China was using Wendi Deng to manipulate him- and then ignoring the warning.

4881 2018-01-29 13:57:50 Oh, please! So what caused the 1970's UK socialist government to fail and destroy our economy?

Why has socialism failed everywhere it has been tried? Oil prices and American sanctions?

Or a fundamental failure of the system!

So glad to reduce my smoke intake and explore microdosing. Quit tobacco w/booze long ago and less smoke will help in the gym
4891 2018-01-29 13:57:05 So glad I requested off work today. Gonna take care of some business! And by that I mean get an oil change and watch the @PriceIsRight

4893 2018-01-29 13:57:05 I heard this theory; high oil price was the final straw that tipped off the financial crisis, budgets already stretched by mortgages & boom
4894 2018-01-29 13:57:02 > Capitalism fails
"that's part of the system, we don't pick winners"
> Global financial meltdown
"this is somehow the governments fault!
> Venezuela is imploding over an oil crisis & over spending
"SEE, SOCIALISM DOESN'T WORK. GULAGS! HOLODOMOR! WHAT IS SCANDINAVIA!"

4935 2018-01-29 13:51:48 Iraq Oil Minister at Chatham House today says the Ministry's goal is to make Baiji oil refinery 50% operational by end of 2018, without external investment. Strange emphasis on it being a 'national effort', given Iraq lack of funds.

4981 2018-01-29 13:45:35 It's not legal. Only the FG can build that bridge. Nigeria doesn't know that the South East will open up and the pressure on Lagos will reduce. Some people are benefiting from the status quo. That is why the Dangote refinery is there. A'Ibom with largest oil has 0 and 0 seaport
4982 2018-01-29 13:44:01 I remember back when it actually took an entire week to have "bid week" in 1990!  It was difficult (being an oil guy originally) to refer to a natural gas end user as a "market" as in, "I've got a market on Columbia Gulf..."....Now it's like a few hours I suppose.

5003 2018-01-29 13:42:23 Met Iraq Oil Minister today, he rubbished concerns about tribal fighting in Basra. Says there has been sporadic tribal fighting since Iraq was founded, and it doesnt affect international business...I think he is underplaying the gravity of the rising violence, its destabilizing

5012 2018-01-29 13:41:11 Is it acceptable to pan fry a battered Mars bar? Deep frying seems like such a waste of oil
5013 2018-01-29 13:41:10 Actually, regulation handles our situation better: CAFE standards for oil, air pollution regulation for coal and fracking bans for gas. Incentives for EVs, wind and solar deployment are also important.

5035 2018-01-29 13:37:47 Well Trump is taking credit for the DOW rally which was started by Obama, But it's not okay for Obama to take credit for low oil prices under his administration? Interesting.

5037 2018-01-29 13:37:36 Is it an actual oil? Otherwise maybe those cotton gloves would be better?

5039 2018-01-29 13:37:28 Sounds more plausible to me (esp as Russia & China are now big in Iraqi oil). I suspect the real politik was that the US was tired of Saddam destabilising the middle-East. Iran makes same mistake at its peril, but US appetite for war ltd to missile strikes at best, imo

Always check and change your cars oil.

No single step will help an engine last longer than regular oil and filter changes will. Conversely, nothing will destroy an engine faster than neglecting oil-level checks or fresh-oil changes.

5173 2018-01-29 13:17:52 When we had 80 dollar oil the profit margins were much different for gasoline. With the massive drop in oil prices under the Obama administration oil companies began profiting off gasoline sales. Will they be willing to curb that profit margin when the oil hit's 80? 100? Nope.
5174 2018-01-29 13:17:50 Oil tanking?? What happened to peak oil??? We were all lied to, massively. Sounds like Peak Climate, too...

5214 2018-01-29 13:12:10 Truth is always like oil in water. No matter how much water you add, oil always floats on top. So, always believe in truth & true relations.
5215 2018-01-29 13:11:56 Yeah, exactly!  Like, "you  probably shouldn't change your oil while the car is resting on a stack of bricks but...you do you man"
5216 2018-01-29 13:11:55 “Climate change” is more accurate in a vacuum, but it arguably wouldn’t have been adopted with all the clamoring from oil company lobb — er, I mean from responsible Republican politicians — about how “global warming” was alarmist and bad for the economy.

5357 2018-01-29 12:58:36 So the sanctions against Russia are words only to quiet people down. They are not being enforced 

Why would Putin enforce sanctions against himself?

Especially when Russia state oil/gas basically IS Putin. 

Somebody ask Trump why sanctions aren't being enforced.
5358 2018-01-29 12:57:49 I mean, if you’re going to get angry about anything, get angry about the use of palm oil specifically. Otherwise, nothing should be a surprise
5359 2018-01-29 12:57:47 Thats insane. Its all tax when the price of oil is as low as it is now. What our government wants it to force ppl off gasoline but what it really is doing is making it harder for ppl to live.

5436 2018-01-29 12:48:00 There's something wrong with this. There's way too much powder to be dissolved in that little palm oil. Too much solute not enough solvent.

5438 2018-01-29 12:47:47 Change doctors.  The medical field and pharmaceutical companies do not make money on coconut oil.  They do make money in the chemicals they charge you for, for hundreds of dollars.  Wise up.  These homeopathic remedies can replace medicine in SOME CASES.  Educate yourself.
5439 2018-01-29 12:47:43 So in Nigeria, does the population get the benefits of the oil? Er, no, is the answer

5552 2018-01-29 12:31:56 Why are allowing export of petroleum product to refineries and then give them export incentive. Stop export reduce our import. Also why are we allowing import of edible oil. Stop farsan business. Our import bill be down considerably also dollar will go down

5566 2018-01-29 12:29:53 On the subject of palm oil personally I think it is one of the most environmentally destructive crops that has expanded in the so called eco friendly move to biofuel, it is very sad flying over Malaysia and Indonesia to see the habitat destruction it has caused.

5573 2018-01-29 12:28:58 My face really hates any coconut oil (cocos nucifera) derived ingredient. Even its cleaner derivative, caprylic/capric triglyceride which has a 0 acne and irritation rating, still clogs my pores. Coconut oil is poison to the skin, period.
5574 2018-01-29 12:28:54 Yep. Strategically it was completely crazy. Thatcher's obsession with the free market but heavily influenced by the US oil cos who wanted open access to the N Sea & brought their supply chain with them.  Norway gained dramatically from sticking to their guns.
5575 2018-01-29 12:28:48 Unfortunately, it's just not very convicing. There are plenty of dictators, many millions of people that live under oppression. Why do we only "free" those whose oppression takes place over oil reserves? And even then, it's selective. Why are Saudi dictators okay?
5576 2018-01-29 12:28:40 No war over oil and profit is worth it.

5582 2018-01-29 12:26:15 It's hard to take you seriously when you clearly are just regurgitating Fox taking points. You can research why on your own. It isn't too complex.

First - you can't redistribute oil profits to social programs if there aren't oil profits to redistribute.

5599 2018-01-29 12:23:03 Put that silly press media/dumb analyst narrative out of your head forever. The US cannot be a swing producer b/c it is a huge net importer of crude oil and does not have any spare capacity. These are critical requirements of a swing producer & the U.S. ain't & never will be!
5600 2018-01-29 12:22:54 I don’t really care how much money City spends or what kind of picture the media spins. United are more then capable to spend as much as them and more. And they don’t need to be back by oil money to do it either. Blame the Glazers and the board for not spending more.

I do however strongly believe that even with booms and busts in oil price, most Saudis identify control (not cash) as king, and therefore ARAMCO must remain 100% Saudi.

5866 2018-01-29 11:43:08 UK has funded NS oil exploration—are you against funding in this manner? UK NS oil and gas fields are some of the most expensive to exploit; other producers are able to generate taxation revenue because their extraction, transport, and infrastructure costs are much lower.

5888 2018-01-29 11:39:47 A substantial rise in oil prices results in a substantial rise in gas prices. That hurts people. Thanks poor and middle class, anyway. I'd venture a guess that the 1% is making plenty of money off of it, though.

I'd rather not accidentally pour liquid fat on myself while spending 5-10 minutes churning my lunch at work.

5978 2018-01-29 11:21:38 It makes sense to have an integrated oil company, MRPL and HPCL will also merge before HPCL will eventually merge with ONGC. Also ONGC in this form more stable and less susceptible to oil prices. Fiscal deficit contained doing this.
5979 2018-01-29 11:21:20 For the first time in 45 years, the federal government has projected that non-oil revenue will surpass oil revenue in 2018. Kemi Adeosun

5981 2018-01-29 11:21:06 Do weekly hair masques with coconut oil. One night a week put coconut oil on, sleep with it on and wash out in the morning. Doing this will mean you don't need any product on your hair when letting it dry. Also refrain from applying heat to your hair.

5984 2018-01-29 11:20:10 More than 200 scientists have called on the American Museum of Natural History to cut ties with board member Rebekah Mercer, who has also funded “climate denial” groups in order to protect the fossil fuel industry's pollution-causing extraction of oil and gas.

6042 2018-01-29 11:09:15 I know. Same with the 700 or so trading companies that deal in the sale of the oil. Mr Woods moved his venture offshore. That’s where we need a Gov to ensure Scottish profits are taxed here or Corp tax is low to encourage companies to register here!
6043 2018-01-29 11:08:55 Essentially we missed the boat around the Abram / Sheikh times. Let's be clear - fans simply want success and the only people guaranteed to deliver that are rich oil barons who don't care about profit and loss.

6312 2018-01-29 10:19:32 If you're using HMRC's data in aggregate form then it would be all UK exports; if you're regional coding then it would be classed as 'unknown region'. You should also clarify which reports you're using. SG's ESS, for example, excludes oil and gas.

6317 2018-01-29 10:18:47 As India is poised for robust growth, is high oil prices a major concern ? Will oil prices going up hold back real economic activity??
6318 2018-01-29 10:18:11 can't federal government make use of the oil rather than wasting it? Or is that the best way out?

6332 2018-01-29 10:14:22 india's growth rate s lower than the previous govt. a barrel of crude oil was around 120 dollar but it s around 60 dollars, still the growth rate s low and the petrol price s very high. where does all the money go?

6355 2018-01-29 10:09:41 Since HMRC is primarily concerned with collection of UK taxes, this is a good solution. But remember that GERS assigns oil and gas revenues to Scotland on a different model, not using HMRC's regional coding, and certainly not using regional export figures alone.

6371 2018-01-29 10:06:01 If oil from NS rigs is transferred to Scotland it gets a Scottish regional tax code. If oil is processed on rigs and transferred direct to other countries, then it doesn't—HRMC allocates it 'unknown region' in this case, because for regional coding this makes sense.

6397 2018-01-29 10:00:35 Some help, please @EuroCarParts?

Just been into branch to buy oil. 3 bottles on the shelf, but I wasn't allowed to buy any of them because they're all reserved.

One reservation was placed LAST YEAR but the staff weren't able to cancel it and let me buy!

6420 2018-01-29 09:55:55 GERS, on the other hand, assigns oil and gas revenue to Scotland using a separate methodology checked by SG against BEIS data. So HMRC's "unknown origin" doesn't affect GERS at all.

6432 2018-01-29 09:53:21 Yes or change the oil yourself x
6433 2018-01-29 09:53:15 You're confusing HMRC's recording of oil exports with GERS recording of oil and gas revenue to Scotland. In HMRC's case they're concerned with exports from NS where oil is processed on rigs and dispatched to other countries; not entering the UK or getting regional coding.

6439 2018-01-29 09:51:12 I knowww! How do you not read ingredients?? And how do you not look up the ones you can't pronounce??

Though everyone should stop buying stuff with palm oil because that industry is horrific.

6460 2018-01-29 09:45:36 im sure he takes quotes from focus groups (entirely made up of his base) and repeats them as best he can. A lot of what he says (e.g. Shithole countries) can be explained by this. Also his climate change adviser is probably a coal/oil CEO.

6529 2018-01-29 09:30:19 Why in the hell would we add large tariffs to solar unless big oil is against it.  Our Secretary of State must have some influence in this since he was the CEO of Exxon Mobil.  I HATE THIS ADMINISTRATION!!
6530 2018-01-29 09:29:04 I burnt myself with oil at my first job and it sucked for a few days, blisters stung Everytime I washed my hands.

Standing up for an hour+, no aircon, nowhere for your bags, unsafe, wedged in with unwashed male armpits in your face - where's the relative benefit, esp for women?
6534 2018-01-29 09:28:04 Ofc Norwegian tax system has pros and cons but IMHO oil and high level of living in your country are connected. Norwegian gross domestic product in 46% comes from taxes. Most of them are from upstream sector.

6536 2018-01-29 09:28:00 Their level of ignorance about Nigeria/Africa is very alarming. Some of them even thinks the only modern structure we have is the oil terminal and the country's capital, the rest is just pure jungle
6537 2018-01-29 09:28:00 Fridays drop quickly snaffled up this morning. There is an overhang here but there is also an abundance of news flow that's been delivered and I suspect more to come. Its seems a very positive place to be right now especially into an ever rising price of oil #UOG

There are alternatives & i gaurantee most consumers would prefer you not include this environemental and socially damaging product in your foods.

Over 80% oil wells allocated and sold to northerners. That $1 was N22 in 1999 didn't say economy was rosy.
6579 2018-01-29 09:18:24 This oil is very good for uterine health. Since it regulates the production of the estrogen hormone, it reduces the chances of post-menopause tumor or cyst formation in the uterus, also known as uterine cancer. #Health
6580 2018-01-29 09:18:18 Frankincense oil is very effective as a sedative because it induces a feeling of mental peace, relaxation, satisfaction, and spirituality. It also awakens insight, makes you more introspective and lowers anxiety, anger, and stress.  #Health
6581 2018-01-29 09:18:12 It soothes cough and eliminates phlegm deposited in the respiratory tracts and the lungs. Frankincense essential oil also provides relief from bronchitis and congestion of nasal tract, larynx, pharynx, bronchi, and lungs. #Health
6582 2018-01-29 09:18:05 #ambernews UK energy MA prices rose on cold weather, while curve prices dropped on lower Brent crude oil and carbon prices.
6583 2018-01-29 09:18:05 Frankincense essential oil is a natural and safe alternative. It promotes urination and helps you lose that extra water weight, as well as fats, sodium, uric acid, and various other toxins from the body, with the added advantage of lowering blood pressure.  #Health
6584 2018-01-29 09:17:59 Overall, frankincense essential oil tones and boosts health and is, therefore, considered a tonic.  #Health
6585 2018-01-29 09:17:53 As a cytophylactic, Frankincense oil promotes regeneration of healthy cells and also keeps existing cells and tissues healthy. #Health
6586 2018-01-29 09:17:41 I'm Scottish and white and Jimmys ma pal. I don't quit even if the English still treat us like slaves, tax us more on oil and fish and wind power we generate and won't let us be a nation again. I don't quit. Free one day baby.
6587 2018-01-29 09:17:39 The palm oil is what bothers me.
6588 2018-01-29 09:17:39 They're not 'mature', they're 'depleting'. "Enhanced oil recovery" from end of life wells uses proprietary technology, hence why certain firms specialize in it. The bigger story here though is that this is happening across the world right now... meaning?

6590 2018-01-29 09:16:40 Thank you 4Kreport. We're particularly impressed with your well researched article and attention to details. More oil to your wheels.
6591 2018-01-29 09:16:34 Oil changes should be part of a service. On an old car, any garage will do it. It may be that other work is required filters, even the dreaded timing belt change. Just had that for the Fiat.
6592 2018-01-29 09:16:27 Oil Prices held firm on strong demand, a weaker dollar and ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC and Russia

6595 2018-01-29 09:15:39 The biggest crime ever done in hi-fi? The adoption of RCA/phono/cinch connections. XLR would have been much better even for unbalanced as you can separate signal and electrical grounds. RCA created a snake oil industry of partial mitigations. If it has RCA, ditch it!
6596 2018-01-29 09:15:30 On the whole I agree, but Labour did move the maritime boundary of Scotland placing oil fields into English waters, so will work in London’s interests.  While a lot of the values Corbyn holds I agree with he is no friend of Scotland actively votes against Scotland’s interests.
6597 2018-01-29 09:15:22 Yes. Bloke down the road. Not your Verger though. He’d just get revenge on you by using lamp oil

6602 2018-01-29 09:13:34 Debating whether oil staying at this level means they may hike more than the 2x priced. Which means EM sell off.

6691 2018-01-29 08:53:13 I try not buy anything with palm oil in it, and it is in a surprising number of supermarket things.
6692 2018-01-29 08:52:43 Mmm non-animal lipase (potentially also useful for removing aged oil varnishes from artworks)
6693 2018-01-29 08:52:42 I think it’s because of the amount of palm oil in it/the ratio.
Palm oil isn’t really a necessary ingredient but is regularly used as an filler in Most products.
It’s also one of the most damaging products in the world, in terms of destruction of habitat & carbon emissions.

6792 2018-01-29 08:30:18 This year oil prices went up that affected consumption and govt finances and also held back real economic activity: Chief Economic Adviser Dr #ArvindSubramanian
6793 2018-01-29 08:29:51 Coconut oil is my best friend
6794 2018-01-29 08:29:41 Fish-Based Omega-3 8-Times More Effective Than Flaxseed Oil At Preventing Tumours.
6795 2018-01-29 08:29:26 I totally agree with @faroukAlabi However, I think we should also consider measures that will increase government revenue. Capital spending will be difficult if we maintain an oil dependent economy.

6805 2018-01-29 08:27:54 @narendramodi @PMOIndia We should try and reduce our dependence on oil imports to insulate against highjacking our economy.Immediate blending with methanol will help a lot. Please so something asap

6812 2018-01-29 08:27:00 ...and how we've neglected our cocoa, rubber, timber, palm oil resources because of oil.

6822 2018-01-29 08:26:33 You realise a lower USD isnt a bad thing for GDP growth? GDP has actually increased to almost 3% this is very good... Obama had low interest rates and qe but that was offset by low oil prices leading to somewhat flat relative growth
6823 2018-01-29 08:26:25 Kalo kamu sehari2 pake make up yg cenderung heavy, pake oil based cleanser. Kayak biore oil cleanser. Kalo cm make up sekedarnya pake micellar water atau milk cleanser. Abis dari situ kamu cuci muka lg pake face wash

6853 2018-01-29 08:21:15 Read the article first. All it says is that American diplomatic influence could increase as oil prices rise. The price rises and falls globally at the same rate based on global trends. #DonTheCon has nothing to do with it. All this means to regular Americans is higher gas prices.

It's good you have replied about your palm oil source, so thanks.

But this answer does not seem entirely open and honest.

WHICH palm oil plantations WHERE?

Also expects oil prices to rise by more than 12% in the coming financial year.
6981 2018-01-29 07:50:35 Then you are lying to yourself. Since it is not true. There are some rich people who moved out after making money but Wallenberg, Bonnier, Lundin oil, HM Pehrsson family all live and pay taxes here.

6987 2018-01-29 07:49:24 To be fair Palm oil is particularly nasty stuff: it’s massively water intensive to grow the plants that produce it and it’s one of the least healthy oils you could use. We should stop using it. But that is not a Nutella specific issue
6988 2018-01-29 07:49:23 Very few will know but the oil mafia working out of Mexico & supplying to companies in Texas USA is way bigger than the drug mafia infact even more violent!

7005 2018-01-29 07:45:46 You said it was tough to spot olive oil imposters, the ones that have been secretly diluted with cheap PUFA oils.  How do we know which ones are bad?  Is there a list of brands that are good?  I thought grapeseed oil was good.  I want to avoid all the bad vegetable oils.

7038 2018-01-29 07:38:37 It's not better for you. There is no science that demonstrates that. It's ridiculous pseudoscience put forward by snake oil merchants like David Wolfe who prey on people who constantly fall for the silly idea that 'natural' is automatically better.
7039 2018-01-29 07:38:25 “Global Warming” became a buzzword that the GOP and big oil demonized in the publicity sphere. So “Climate Change” was adopted to encompass the more volatile nature of local weather patterns which are still trending warmer but with more violent swings both directions.

Any clue on what is going on with SP/ST case?
IPL? Food-For-Oil? Mehr? Are there something else?

Is ST so influential that there is no progress since 4 years & no court, no agency, no political party is taking any step?

Must be more than just meet of eye!

7235 2018-01-29 06:55:17 One  would think that the US gov would do anything possible  to stop oil price from increasing further.

7325 2018-01-29 06:34:08 I second that! If you use face safe oils your skin produces less oil itself. Also until you get insurance you can see estheticians and they can help you. ALSO there is so much skincare info online/YouTube. It’s helped me learn how to handle my dry skin, thank god.
7326 2018-01-29 06:34:02 Now oil prices reduce  !
7327 2018-01-29 06:33:55 I'd eat each of those ingredients by themselves. The hell is this? Of course it has oil in it. Every other ingredient is nut, crystal or powder. Without the oil it would just be tastey chalk dust.

7411 2018-01-29 06:18:19 The price of oil and inflation are often seen as being connected in a cause and effect relationship. As oil prices move up or down, inflation follows in the same direction.

7477 2018-01-29 06:03:02 @BetoORourke is everywhere! He showed up at my house, whacked my weeds, trimmed every bush, and raked away all the old dead leaves. He stopped at my friend's and gave her kids flu shots, did the dishes, and changed her oil. Texas tweeps, what has Beto done for you?
7478 2018-01-29 06:02:52 Do they also not get a better fuel contract rate than $3/gallon, after all the plumping, fluffing, and sucking off of the oil industry they constantly and continuously do..!?!

7495 2018-01-29 05:58:46 Frankincense essential oil reduces obstructed and delayed menstruation and delays the advent of menopause. #Health
7496 2018-01-29 05:58:35 The astringent property of Frankincense oil has many benefits. It strengthens the gums, hair roots, tones and lifts skin, contracts muscles, intestines, and blood vessels, and thereby gives protection from premature loss of teeth and hair.  #Health
7497 2018-01-29 05:58:28 The same antiseptic qualities also make frankincense oil a useful preventive measure against oral issues, like bad breath, toothaches, cavities, mouth sores, and other infections. #Health
7498 2018-01-29 05:58:21 Frankincense oil is effective as an antiseptic, and even the fumes or smoke obtained from burning it has antiseptic and disinfectant qualities that eliminate the germs as the smoke filters them out. #Health

7525 2018-01-29 05:53:19 Respected PM Sir,
2 things i would like to ask you. 1. We all are paying road tax, when we buy a vehicle, then why again toll booths are in highways.
2. Crude oil rate in market is very less and why we are paying huge amount of money for petrol.
Thank you.

Loyd.
7526 2018-01-29 05:53:18 The blue tick marks on Twitter have lost their minds. It’s all as @ScottAdamsSays has predicted.

7563 2018-01-29 05:46:19 The fire fighting department doesn't carry water to the scene of a fire, let's first agree on that point.

Also note that it is a requirement to have fire a extinguisher wherever you have an indoor flame and a fire blanket where you are heating oil. Did the neighbours have this?

7565 2018-01-29 05:46:08 Men want respect, they say. Yet from what I'm observing, it's the demanding, manipulative, bitchy women who have the most "successful" relationships. It's the creaky wheel that gets the oil. And instead of bitch-slapping them you are GYOW. Understandable, but will it help?

Have you ever made a cake? Before mixing it looks like a bunch of nasty flour and oil and slimy eggs.

But then you mix it, bake it, and a wonderful thing happens called chemistry where the components react together to make something new.
7629 2018-01-29 05:34:24 dnd was wild today
I accidently set a child on fire because I was startled while trying to drink oil and then we turned the burnt child into a cat and kidnapped him

7638 2018-01-29 05:33:40 One commissioner from my state said that "revenue from cashew nuts will surpass crude oil". Your thoughts guys!
7639 2018-01-29 05:33:34 “Grow before complain”. Let’s first have 8% GDP growth ( non oil) for a decade.

7659 2018-01-29 05:31:45 Could be the sugar or maybe the fat/oil? I know some things that are higher in fat can do that to me if I'm not used to them?

7672 2018-01-29 05:29:18 Oil based stains suck to have to remove. Carbona makes a stain solution that actually does get oil and grease out of fabrics.

7675 2018-01-29 05:29:03 You are so right. Smoking anything when pregnant is not good. CBD oil in oral drops would be a better choice.

7690 2018-01-29 05:26:46 If u have dry skin it means when you apply it , you are sealing in the dryness not the moisture and vice versa. Try vitamin E oil
7691 2018-01-29 05:26:28 After all, it may work the petition from the @WWF adress to Trump about the oil in the arctic, that i was reluctant to sign. I hope

7702 2018-01-29 05:25:11 Technically it is because it's a sealant oil. For some it works, others not so much like me. But This weekend I slept at my aunts&I didn't have my moisturizer so I washed my face with water and put coconut milk on a cotton swab and wow

7719 2018-01-29 05:22:18 I know what you mean. I'd rather not vape myself though. My CBD oil drops are for oral use, no vape. They help tremendously for my pain.
7720 2018-01-29 05:21:57 great observation! What's even more amazing is their "propulsion" on a very thin layer of oil on a hot pan.

7769 2018-01-29 05:15:36 tea tree oil smells so good

7772 2018-01-29 05:15:09 okay kakatapos ko lang gamitin for the first time. Minix ko siya with apple cider vinegar and 3 drops of manuka oil. Sobrang nabanat face ko. Namumula siya now but ang lambot pagkatapos. Feel ko humaba buhay ko mga 3 seconds HAHAHA.

7774 2018-01-29 05:15:04 I don’t see how the water would be effective long enough though but coconut oil is one I forgot about.
7775 2018-01-29 05:14:54 You guys like throwing oil spills? Let's throw a fucking Tsunami at you and see how you like it.
7776 2018-01-29 05:14:41 @prattprattpratt Been eating clean for 28 days now. Nothing but lean meat, fresh veg and fruit. No oil. No dairy. No sugar. I’d rate it a 8 on the Pratt scale. On the plus side, I’ve lost 12 pounds.
7777 2018-01-29 05:14:37 Olive oil yan besh. No worries
7778 2018-01-29 05:14:28 毎度のことだけど可愛い
7779 2018-01-29 05:14:17 I need to re-up on my jojoba oil.
7780 2018-01-29 05:14:16 I know it destroyed some people’s skin and saved others for the soap. But my grandma breaks out in a rash when she puts jojoba oil on her skin. A small amount of lotion can cause a big reaction.
7781 2018-01-29 05:14:12 Eh, until i get a good oil cleanser //
7782 2018-01-29 05:14:07 also id just like to thank coconut oil for doing That to my hair
7783 2018-01-29 05:13:55 I bought this lavender/sweet orange/hops/chammomile essential oil & mixed it up with some sweet almond & jojoba oils and slather it all over myself before bed, it's lovely, so restful

7797 2018-01-29 05:11:58 @catharob No mention of mineral oil as carcinogen in moisturizers? Seems like the research is hard to ignore. Using vegetable oils a good alternative, as touted by some?
7798 2018-01-29 05:11:49 Coconut oil or water

7806 2018-01-29 05:10:52 "Oh, of course," he responds, somewhat embarrassed. He wasn't sure what kind of oil he was thinking of. Maybe it had just been a long day. Yeah, he was going to go with that. "I trust you." At Prank's touch, he began to relax slowly. He hadn't had a massage in over a decade.

7815 2018-01-29 05:09:32 من از مردم ایران ناراضیم.
دید بازی ندارند.
وقتی همه سرمایه کشور را چپاول کردند و کشور از تمام کشورهای دنیا عقب ماند،
زمانیکه فرصتهای زمانی و سرمایه گذاری ایران از دست رفت،
وقتی جوانان ما معتاد شدند،  تازه میایند در خیابان و میپرسند 
نان من کو ؟
و تا به حال نپرسیده اند حق من کو!؟
7816 2018-01-29 05:09:28 Exactly.  Except to get IBM to stop selling the Nazis computers to count the prisoners, Ford to sell the trucks, and Royal Dutch Shell, Standard Oil and IG Farben to stop colluding to import oil to fuel the machinery.
7817 2018-01-29 05:09:23 coconut oil do the body good..
7818 2018-01-29 05:09:22 Coconut oil is #life

7820 2018-01-29 05:09:07 Ah, degrees. Seem so old fashioned these days when even the likes of the queen snake oil salesman herself declared "our truth" is all that matters.  Who cares if it's 'the truth' after all the ends justify the means and all things must be viewed thru the race lens.

7823 2018-01-29 05:08:15 They could help fend off the oil companies that Trump gave rights to reservation land.
7824 2018-01-29 05:08:09 How and why different liquids mix and react when mixed. For example oil and water or a Black and Tan. Why does soap destroy grease?
7825 2018-01-29 05:07:57 I agree. CBD oil is amazing. It helps me tremendously for my pain. I have MD.
7826 2018-01-29 05:07:53 こんなにインフルエンザを相手にしてないのに、感染しないのは何かの陰謀を感じる

7828 2018-01-29 05:07:37 Yes. It's not the San Andres, but collapse of caverns under shelf. I was researching that they drilled for oil in Long Beach and it sunk 27 feet. They have to pump water in over the oil to keep it afloat. Still researching validity.
7829 2018-01-29 05:07:28 If you think about it, an oil diffuser is really just a vape for your home
7830 2018-01-29 05:07:24 Have you tried CBD oil? It has a slew of benefits, including for seizures, and is not psychoactive. Marijuana has THC, so CBD may be a a good idea, too. Doctors everywhere are reporting the benefits over marijuana.
7831 2018-01-29 05:07:02 As far as scents go, I’m a Bay Rum boy, like it’s 1958. Maybe some coconut oil for the beard. #skincaretalk
7832 2018-01-29 05:07:01 Sunday nights are for Netflix, face masks & castor oil hair treatment.
7833 2018-01-29 05:06:52 The Thunder vs 76ers is turning into quite the rivalry. Love the venom and animosity. Gets the juices boiling. I miss the oil school rivalries in today's manufactured super team driven NBA. Only problem is, 76ers have to actually win for it to be a rivalry. 
7834 2018-01-29 05:06:29 I need to change my babies oil
7835 2018-01-29 05:06:21 Johnson’s Baby Oil Gel shea & cocoa butter to moisturize. Game changer. Seriously.
7836 2018-01-29 05:06:14 I just started using coconut oil and it smells so good 
7837 2018-01-29 05:06:10 Did I ever tell you guys about the time in middle school I had some sort of breakdown during Spring Break and put bath oil in my hair and shaved off my eyebrows?
7838 2018-01-29 05:06:04 Uhhhhh.... Macbook Air i got for free at work last year... Its alive, i'm not making this up at all. The drowned in mineral oil Macbook Air comes on
7839 2018-01-29 05:05:53 Apparently her problem was mostly with the palm oil, which is just a specific kind of vegetable oil... like does this person not eat anything ever? There’s oil in damn near everything that hits a frying pan.

7843 2018-01-29 05:05:31 why take marijuana for health problems when CBD oil is legal and works better for health issues. unless you want the high...

7847 2018-01-29 05:05:16 The biggest part in their announcement for me was 1) The fact they currently only have BTC and ETH, meaning $XRP will be the 3rd coin, and $100s-$1000s cheaper than the other two coins.
2) Straight FIAT/XRP pairing. 3) Can purchase with credit cards. 4) Oil money #xrpthestandard
7848 2018-01-29 05:05:02 It's too bad dumping oil into Boston harbor has more serious environmental impact than dumping tea.
7849 2018-01-29 05:04:53 Do not bathe in orange essential oil or your skin will burn off i'm warning you I already took one for the team

7854 2018-01-29 05:04:29 Can’t go wrong with the Hask ones at Walmart and they’re only like $1.50 and I can get like 3 uses out of 1 packet. I also really like the Palmer’s Olive Oil one (it smells SO GOOD) but I saw it at a Walmart like one time so idk if they all carry them
7855 2018-01-29 05:03:58 This was two decades after the Standard Oil monopoly breakup, though. An oil operator still has to pay attention to the price the oil sells for and whether a monopolist can drive it down
7856 2018-01-29 05:03:51 I use black castor oil, wild growth, and coconut oil
7857 2018-01-29 05:03:45 someone educate me as to why coconut oil is bad

7881 2018-01-29 05:00:29 No it’s not, where are you getting that from? In what economics class did you learn that? What it represents is that there is more food now then there ever was, more cars, more oil, more everything then there ever was and it’s cheaper then it ever was
7882 2018-01-29 05:00:19 Dr. Sachs, are you ever going to consider all the people employed by oil? All the blue-collar truck drivers earning 6 figures now? And the increase in manufacturing b/c of oil (plastics, low energy prices, industry clustering)???
7883 2018-01-29 05:00:04 Me asking for help is like trying to dissolve oil in water.

7886 2018-01-29 04:59:22 Mr. Krauss, could you also do an article on the people who are benefitting greatly from oil boom: the workers? I am surprised, that remains an untold story. If Trump wins re-election, it will be because of people like my brother!
7887 2018-01-29 04:59:17 Us is ramping up oil productionFrom shale which requires at least around 50 dollars a barrellSo that small car is a must

7915 2018-01-29 04:54:40 Nope! After I wash my hair I put in some leave in conditioner, Argan oil, & a little coconut serum on the ends, then I put in pureology air dry cream, put it in a braid, & sleep in it & when I wake up it comes out like beachy waves

7950 2018-01-29 04:48:11 Lemme just say. Essential oils are so rad. I burned myself twice on accident. (Boiling water spilled on my entire forearm/a curling iron nicked my ear.) I put on lavender essential oil immediately. & not a single blister. Just some tiny scabs in a few places that don’t even hurt.

7952 2018-01-29 04:48:08 As long as everything is washed i dont care if it’s in the same cookwear. If it’s made on shared machinery I don’t care either. Can’t do same fryer oil though because I can taste whatever else was frying in it usually.

7960 2018-01-29 04:47:00 For me, the BEST deep conditioning is get some  coconut oil, heat the jar under some hot water, smear that all in your hair - like a lot, wrap a moist, heated towel (I toss a wet towel in the dryer until it’s hot but not dry), wait about 30 minutes or longer - then wash.

7963 2018-01-29 04:45:17 A technical success does not designate an economic success. Probably why Green power can’t manage to take more than a 5% market share in Alberta even though it’s extremely subsidized through oil and gas production.
7964 2018-01-29 04:45:05 People be worried about the oil and sugar like you dont need it in your diet lol, and most of the sugar is actually lactose from the—surprise—milk

Also you guys aint gonna eat the whole jar in one go lol
7965 2018-01-29 04:44:56 Can't even believe places like Indiana want to ban CBD oil when it literally has no psychoactive effects and can only be used to cure chronic pain or other medical issues.

7984 2018-01-29 04:41:38 I just realized Wal-Mart changed their baby oil gel fragrance from cocoa butter to "cocoa divine" and THAT'S why it smells like a brown sugar syrup
7985 2018-01-29 04:41:36 Agreed.
My current understanding: The problem is NOT with over-consumption of O6. It IS that most O6 consumed by most people, is highly-processed, adulterated & oxidized. O3 supplementation (esp. via Fish Oil), is becoming highly/problematic. O6 “Parent Omega” can make O3.
7986 2018-01-29 04:41:17 Your mcm like to watch niggas in oil fake fight each other
7987 2018-01-29 04:41:07 In all seriousness, the fact that each individual fry gets a bit of oil saturation makes the process entirely different. I challenge your logic sir...

7996 2018-01-29 04:39:53 When you hear of clean water shortage stories you begin to say perhaps the oil exploration business on Lake Malawi ain't the best thing 2 do
7997 2018-01-29 04:39:45 U have a very interesting thought. Im hoping the course of resources & the means 2 get them can change.  These coastal democrat states are stopping the drilling. It often bothers me that in this day & age that we are still dependent on oil & gas, but Opec won't go away easily.

8004 2018-01-29 04:38:36 Actually, the US placed oil embargoes against Japan because of Japanese aggression in Asia. Your fantasies failed to address the point that most of the US war effort in 1941 to mid 1943 was directed against Japan (because of Pearl Harbor), Not Germany.

But I’ll also come home & bury my face into my dog’s belly, inviting God-knows-what into my face.

8040 2018-01-29 04:31:07 Can you name one? The French Total Oil CEO made no specific commitment, and the Siemens next-gen gas turbines deal was already in the works last September. Their CEO lied to Trump at Davos and said it was due to the December tax cut. And Siemens recently cut jobs in the US. SAD!

8061 2018-01-29 04:27:02 The water quality in the East China Sea where an #Iranian tanker sank over three weeks ago, causing an oil slick, meets the highest Chinese…
8062 2018-01-29 04:26:44 Music and art are the products of politics, you can't separate them like oil and water.
8063 2018-01-29 04:26:33 I love turning on my essential oil diffuser and curling up to read a good book. A good book as in my text books that I don’t like to ready but am trying to convince myself otherwise.

8066 2018-01-29 04:25:34 This is more pronounced for Gawadar city that sits on the strategic mouth of the Arabian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, witnessing the movement of large oil shipping lines to Asia, Africa and Europe.
8067 2018-01-29 04:25:02 I’m suppose to get an oil change in the morning... but imma just wait til next week

8069 2018-01-29 04:24:41 The distribution is deeply concerning. Profound deep state corruption in many of the 0 states. Also, many indictments under the corrupt 9th circuit. And what up in Texas? Big oil? Illegals? Bush Cartel?
8070 2018-01-29 04:24:29 Why buy make up remover wipes when you can buy baby wipes, put some coconut oil on it, and it have the same affect!
8071 2018-01-29 04:24:15 Bau coconut takpe, sedap je. Yg bestnya kalau pakai coconut oil, ia selamat dimakan. So kalau main ngan partner, masa lancap tu kalau tiba2 partner ko nk terus isap batang ko pun takde masalah. Kalau pakai ky atau lubricant kena cuci dulu sbb tak eatable

8083 2018-01-29 04:23:13 With significant resource revenues from oil and gas, potash, etc., provinces with relatively small populations often look like they’re run by geniuses at the shallow end of the pool. Ontario, by comparison, is the deep end, no guarantee Wall wud know what he’s doing there.

8143 2018-01-29 04:13:54 yeah, I prefer using regular lotion bc my skin is used to it, but coconut oil can be great once your skin is used to it. most of the reason why people break out right after switching to coconut oil is bc skin really likes patterns and sticking to the same shit

8204 2018-01-29 04:07:08 I would add a little olive oil to the pumpkin to coat the stomach.
8205 2018-01-29 04:06:46 Due for an oil change
8206 2018-01-29 04:06:35 To be honest I am not interested in your thoughts on how free markets are distorted by favouritism. You can pontificate all you want but the fact of the matter is NYC benefits from the oil corporations they are suing & continue to do so this very minute.

8210 2018-01-29 04:06:16 tonight I finally found some Jamaican Black castor oil and I used it but the SMELL omfg, it just better tf work cause the smell is HORRIFIC.
8211 2018-01-29 04:05:50 We don't need growth in oil and gas industry we need divestment. We need investment in green energy technologies. Every community can find ways to be 100+% green energy efficient.
8212 2018-01-29 04:05:46 I've tried it with different long esters of T (C & E) and Tren ace. I also don't care for the typical grapeseed oil as a carrier, it gives me pip. I like MCT, very smooth.
8213 2018-01-29 04:05:46 last night i had a dream of a smoking hot wolf man and he was rubbing oil on his chest and i really wanted to fuck him but was too nervous to ask

8215 2018-01-29 04:05:38 The US has been sabotaging Venezuela's economy since Hugo Chavez, because they want to control Venezuela's oil. Sanctions against individuals is a canard.
8216 2018-01-29 04:05:37 Jenny sent me this oil haha
8217 2018-01-29 04:05:34 Mainly all the epa regulations and the climate change regulations that made us dependant on forean oil. Consumer confidence has a lot to do with it also.
8218 2018-01-29 04:05:24 Taking this black seed oil twice a day is no fun at all but I know it's going to improve my overall health

8221 2018-01-29 04:04:55 Oil storage was already full one year ago. Sale is 5% of world production. Not even tripling in size in 3 years would they cover deficit. Plus shale oil does not work well in most refineries

First we pay subsidies to sell our oil of royalties.
Second to get the oil we pollute the water to pump down a hole to bring oil to the surface. 
Third, we can't drink oil.
Fourth, wecant live without water. Finally, we have 100% green alternative energieses to go to.

8270 2018-01-29 03:58:23 If not allergic.. red palm oil with turmeric and black pepper (best in tomato soup) is really helpful for cleaning the lungs, coconut oil helps too but not as well

Bruce Fife has a website that explains why, yes sounds hoaky but it works

8353 2018-01-29 03:45:30 I took 1 fish oil pill. I am now healthy.
8354 2018-01-29 03:45:29 Yes indeed -- how could I forget Midnight Oil, by the way? Pretty much EVERY song they did was political (and they had a lot of great ones).
8355 2018-01-29 03:45:13 Decided to do a diy hair mask and walked out of the kitchen with coconut oil, honey, and an egg and my parents just watched me and didn’t question anything....like.....why would that be normal?!?

8362 2018-01-29 03:43:48 So what will become of our oil & gas economy as Chinese manufactured renewables grow, O&G demand shrinks and fossil fuel prices slump. Have you ever considered that, Tom?

OIL！
8364 2018-01-29 03:43:39 Healing oil, like Argan oil is only used after the healing process has begun to repair the skin faster.
8365 2018-01-29 03:43:13 The Meowscular Chef asked me to get him fish oil for his paw-thritis and yelled about gains so I'm convinced it's @gains_tweets
8366 2018-01-29 03:43:12 Chef Skinner cut up some acne, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was an old shoe brush, along with grass.

I FEEL LIKE A SMOOTH DOLPHIN
8373 2018-01-29 03:42:24 We're freezing our asses off, and the extra dough buys a lot of heating oil.
8374 2018-01-29 03:42:06 Everyone who thinks everything below the tip of the boot of louisna a is irrelevant is a fool most of your commerce comes from the agricultural and fishing exports/oil deposits and business from NOLA and Baton Rouge you
8375 2018-01-29 03:41:53 We need a flame thrower to burn out the oil markets current go to market strategy like my old buddy Red Adair. Put out the fire by blowing it up take out the oxygen.

8377 2018-01-29 03:41:39 Lars, it's not a probable geologic province for oil and gas. But I was dismayed *when I lived there* that a Compressed Natural Gas port was nixed. Coming or going, that would have been a nice tollbooth to own. But not in Oregon. As you call them.
8378 2018-01-29 03:41:29 Listening to these slow jams making me wanna get on some oil and cry to my baby 
8379 2018-01-29 03:41:25 This rose oil for my diffuser 
8380 2018-01-29 03:41:25 Comfort and growth are like oil and water
8381 2018-01-29 03:41:22 I need bubble baths and essential oil body rubs
8382 2018-01-29 03:40:59 The fossil fuel interests are without a doubt manipulating information and governance but not about made up hydrogen magic ICE fuel insanity.  Im not sure they are into distributing bum dope, their dope(oil/coal) is the dum dope and they want everyone to stay hooked.

8384 2018-01-29 03:40:32 I dab lemon oil on the end of my braid or just inside my shirt collar. When I start to feel overwhelmed I hold it to my nose and take a few deep breaths. The scent of lemon oil lowers corticosterone in the brain and the deep breaths give me a moment to center.
8385 2018-01-29 03:40:27 Coconut oil whoooooo ? I don't know her ....

8391 2018-01-29 03:39:55 Vegetables would be expensive for China to get from Mexico most would have to be flown over. Oil is a recent discovery
8392 2018-01-29 03:39:55 @BobSMueller Dear Mr. Bob (Robert) Mueller, How are you? Our Dear Country is near Bankruptcy and President Trump has sold out to the Oil Industry. I need to beg to you [to the Mth Degree], please, PLEASE TESTIFY about Pres. Trump wanting you fired?? Please?

8394 2018-01-29 03:39:40 They are at 140kbpd of crude alone, with less then 10% naturalgas.  I wouldn't be surprised if it exceeds 150kbpd by Q1, they are extremely active with over 20 rigs in The Torquay play near #Estevan.  I drove out today, it's insane.  Never saw so much oil activity ever in an area
8395 2018-01-29 03:39:37 Tried taking off waterproof mascara, got coconut oil in my eye 
8396 2018-01-29 03:39:21 When do they break out the baby oil?
8397 2018-01-29 03:39:14 The entitlement comment was in response to “we pay enough tax”. We in Alberta pay discounted rates for our services thanks to oil revenue. It’s sad.
8398 2018-01-29 03:39:13 So...I discovered argan oil this weekend.
8399 2018-01-29 03:39:13 Annnnnd? We too made our recipe for a snack. Kinda ran out of canola & had to sub @ThreeFarmers camelina roasted onion & basil oil - gave it an interesting twist. I forgot the salt. Dang it. @ScooterMojo
8400 2018-01-29 03:38:57 Definitely was the processed oil... so no crappy snacks for me..

8403 2018-01-29 03:38:26 Bruno got a woman so let me find a new celebrity to rub coconut oil in their hair.

8412 2018-01-29 03:36:52 What do you think the likelihood of that infrastructure shift happening is? Do u reckon it will be unlikely as fuel/oil firms push to keep
8413 2018-01-29 03:36:36 Con’t You KNOW the Oil Companies will not be able to clean up their mess if they do have a spill in the Arctic! Or along our shores! Without the laws saying they have to do it it won’t be done!  So don’t sit there saying what you are saying unless you Con’t1
8414 2018-01-29 03:36:33 Saudi Arabian central bank's foreign reserves rose in December for a 3rd consecutive month, a sign that higher oil prices may be easing pressure on the government's finances.

Truth is always like oil in water. No matter how much water you add, oil always floats on top. So, always believe in truth & true relations.

8419 2018-01-29 03:35:53 Middle East projection has oil price to drop by 2021 to USD 25.00 a barrel, with electrics and technology  innovation, demand will move from, 100 million barrel a day to 70 million barrel by 2030 a 30% drop. There are western predictions that claims higher oil prices?????

8425 2018-01-29 03:35:10 Why the fuck do we export oil only to import oil from the Middle East?
8426 2018-01-29 03:35:09 Pres. Duterte was not specific. He could have been thinking of 42 bottles of virgin oil or 42 virgin wool sweaters...that came from ugly sheeps.

8430 2018-01-29 03:34:45 I’m getting progressively more snuffly and woozy and rather than sleep I have the overwhelming desire to paint in oil all of these space and sci-fi visions I’ve been having. 

It’s a very good thing I don’t own any oils, & that the Dick Blick by my complex is closed for the night
8431 2018-01-29 03:34:21 Today:

8433 2018-01-29 03:34:06 A toner is good for oil control and rubbing lemon on your face works for dark marks
8434 2018-01-29 03:33:57 Also, lemongrass essential oil works amazing for varicose veins (that episode is on again). Just make sure they’re good quality. Not painful at all!

8442 2018-01-29 03:32:42 No so great for consumers. Our pump prices have gone up even though oil companies no longer pay the 9 cent per gallon tax to help cleanup their spills.
8443 2018-01-29 03:32:36 I live in a dorm with communal bathrooms & my hair is naturally greasy af so neither a bath nor oil sound like a good idea

8494 2018-01-29 03:24:44 Nigeria minister of petroleum committed a blunder by saying that the country is living comfortablely at crude oil price between $45-$46. It is true that politicians maybe comfortable but Nothing is being done. There are no improvements  in the lives of the people.

8505 2018-01-29 03:22:51 Loving Vincent was such a poignant, moving film. I loved every second. A real love letter to Vincent Vangogh, written in every oil paint stroke. It must have taken years to create and the dedication shows. Absolutely breath taking.

8507 2018-01-29 03:22:45 Pakoda is going to be the national industry. There will be free gas and subsidised oil for those who start Pakodas. Pakoda industrial zones will be created. A Chaiwala can not go beyond his roots. Hot tea and Pakodas.

8534 2018-01-29 03:18:45 If you need a new skin care routine but don't wanna spend a lot of money. Make a honey, cinnamon and lemon juice face mask. Leave it on for about 15-20 minutes. Repeat 2-3 times a week. Apply aloe vera to the face afterwards and if you want, when your pores close, apply coco oil
8535 2018-01-29 03:18:32 Timing on that would have been interesting though.  While oil was already big in the state, the discovery of the huge reserve in Glenpool (just south of Tulsa) really boomed this part of the state, which would have been in Sequoyah. That would have really caused further issues.

8544 2018-01-29 03:17:17 I would just rather hear the music than the self righteous speeches. Midnight Oil was a band that made great musical political statements.

8558 2018-01-29 03:15:06 Plastic pollution choking organisms like fish larvae is a big problem.  Permitting plastics to photodegrade tends to float them down to sea.  Using plastics as fuel has a carbon footprint, but no worse than oil, so is probably the most practical.  Wind and solar are good

8567 2018-01-29 03:14:00 something to think about:

-more than 780 MILLION people in the world don’t have access to clean water

-somehow we can transport billions of gallons of oil across the world but not clean water

-we literally shit in clean water without a second thought 

what have we become?

8570 2018-01-29 03:13:31 Me invest? You must be bloody joking. I'm interested in the future of the  planet, not my bank balance. In my view oil is in a financial bubble & likely to fall. Could even gap down if China have finally realised they have been screwed for a decade

8805 2018-01-29 02:41:55 Thank you for this powerful programme. An emotional journey. So interesting to see how palm oil fits into the bigger picture #thelostgirl
8806 2018-01-29 02:41:52 汚い
8807 2018-01-29 02:41:42 Yeah give it a try! You wanna warm up the oil, massage it all over your face and with a wet damp cloth, dab it off. So that some oil is left but your skin is dry. Let me know if it works for you!

8819 2018-01-29 02:40:29 Palm oil is also a notorious transfat so… add that in there too. So it’s worse than most other “oils”.

8827 2018-01-29 02:39:46 Don’t remember exact question but answers were railroads, fur trading, and oil. We answered oil. 
8828 2018-01-29 02:39:45 $$$ difference Jen.

Our economy competes against others.

Our electricity prices are highest in the region.

Our competitors have indegenious coal. We don’t. Transpo puts us at disadvantage.

When oil hit 140, the cost of transpo exceeded the cost of the coal itself 
8829 2018-01-29 02:39:45 I don't care. This is akin to nationalizing oil.

This is gonna sound ridiculous, but you have to ask them not to use too much oil to cook the chicken on the flat top. Oily sandwich is a pain in the ass.

8904 2018-01-29 02:29:20 We don't. We want the taxes *we pay* to go toward providing healthcare, education, safety net services, etc. instead of going toward subsidies for oil companies, a hyper-gigantic military, tax cuts for billionaires, etc. No one thinks things will be provided for free. NO ONE.
8905 2018-01-29 02:29:18 @ There was only a TBS report and that was it. I just started experiencing excessive oil consumption within the past few months.

8906 2018-01-29 02:29:05 It’s all scripted and we probably know who will win, but it’s entertaining, in the same sense your videos are entertaining, just with less oil and sweat.
8907 2018-01-29 02:29:00 Completely wrong. I and many other women has actually reduced the oiliness of our skin with oil cleansing/moisturizing. My skin actually ain’t oil AT ALL anymore.
8908 2018-01-29 02:28:58 I'm not sure if I remember this right but I'm pretty sure I read someone tweet about how primrose oil gave them diarrhoea while in labour so be careful!!
8909 2018-01-29 02:28:51 Muslims live in countries with large oil production. They can protest to their own leaders to demand changes. They don’t want to assimilate they want to invade. No way do I want them here.

Hello my name is Brian Richter. I have a 2007 Camry with bad piston rings in it. My mechanic confirmed the problem. My engine has been consuming too much oil. Since I began driving I've only selected Toyota for my transportation needs.

8921 2018-01-29 02:27:03 I recommend pasta pan fried with olive oil, one egg mixed in and grated cheese.
8922 2018-01-29 02:26:58 That grease may also be the problem. Hub oil is very specific and used to combat lots of elements, grease doesn’t substitute.
8923 2018-01-29 02:26:48 #wwe #RoyalRumble see wrestling fans ie virgins are staying up late tonight to watch men soaked in baby oil pretend to fight.
8924 2018-01-29 02:26:28 To correct what we are looking at this is not a refinery. It is an oil field with pump jacks on individual wells. There is footage of a totally destroyed area that may have been a central production facility but definitely not a refinery. I did watch the entire video. #askDad
8925 2018-01-29 02:26:14 I really don’t know why I seem to think that just because I’m doing a face mask and have my oil diffuser on that my life will turn around, but for some reason I do
8926 2018-01-29 02:25:57 Also if you ever plan on breastfeeding, fuck lanolin. Coconut Oil works so much better.

8930 2018-01-29 02:25:08 But so this is just what I did when I did my own hair. After the actual coloring, it’s also a lot of upkeep. I have a ton of purple shampoo and conditioner, and I usually do a purple conditioner mask like once a week, mixing the purple with another really good one like argan oil.

And I think it is very telling that this administration & Russia both have deep ties to old oil.

8951 2018-01-29 02:22:57 Okay. [Nodding slowly, he goes through the process again with the rest of the chicken while watching the ones already in the oil.]

8957 2018-01-29 02:21:02 I’m sure your banking/oil executive parents are equally shocked people are skeptical of a wealthy member of a political dynasty. I’m so surprised you don’t have your finger on the pulse of the left.
8958 2018-01-29 02:20:57 If you are saying that oil is no longer conventionally fundable then the World Bank (cutting lending), Norwegian sov wealth fund (divesting), Rosneft & even Aramco (divesting) are evidence that the Stone Age did  not end for lack of stones & Oil Age isn't ending for lack of oil

8962 2018-01-29 02:20:12 I put a plug-in in the common area because my roommates keep the apt smelling like a zoo. I come home and it’s broken and there’s oil all over the floor. All of a sudden everybody is Helen Keller???

8987 2018-01-29 02:17:20 But no one is protesting the American occupation of north west Syria where all the oil & natural resources are, if Syria ever going to be rebuilt they desperately need those resources so that makes it obvious what the US & their proxies trying to do.

8994 2018-01-29 02:16:35 Unfortunately, ISIS from Deir Ezzor on the east bank of the Euphrates joined Kurdish forces. The race was to stop the SAA (who crossed at Deir Ezzor) to gain the oil and gas fields.
All backed by the USA of course.

9000 2018-01-29 02:16:07 My  point is reserves are those which are economically extractable & so vary with price & tech/IP development. Infinite oil reserves exist at unaffordable prices. Since energy is the only hard cost limiting factor is secular decline in EROEI. What point are you trying to make?
9001 2018-01-29 02:16:04 
9002 2018-01-29 02:15:32 Well, to be fair the fact that it is apparently 50% sugar isn't exactly good. But, apparently her problem is the fact that it has *gasp* OIL in it. The TYPE of oil isn't great for the environment, but she seems to not understand that it needs SOMETHING to hold it together.

9006 2018-01-29 02:14:43 The French oil giant Total has maintained a similarly stoic silence  since the state-run Pertamina oil company claimed the firm wanted back into the Mahakham gas field, which it had to leave when its contract expired last December.

9008 2018-01-29 02:14:30 The officials are talking on behalf of the company, without the company knowing anything about it,” says one Indonesian oil veteran. “That’s politics, but for me as an industrialist it is very troubling.”

9019 2018-01-29 02:13:03 Definitely aids in the expulsion the next day. Technically speaking though, oil will clog the pours of the vegetable, which will make it take longer to dissolve inside you/release its nutrients somewhat similar to a slow release vitamin.

9059 2018-01-29 02:08:07 been using bio oil for a week now and i can definitely see some changes. My acne scars r fading and im so grateful
9060 2018-01-29 02:07:46 If you want to know how badly I’m stalling on homework, I decided to take a break to cook food and settled on Stir fry. But when I realized I didn’t have oil, I decided to walk to the store (30 min round trip) instead of choosing something else to eat 
9061 2018-01-29 02:07:39 If the top is done and not the bottom, maybe bake it lower inside the oven.

Also, because of the oil in recipe...don't worry you will dry it out.

After baking it and letting it cool, wrap it in cling film and let it sit over night (top down if that's dry) and it will moisten.
9062 2018-01-29 02:07:17 Whom to blame for petrol/diesel price hike?
Oil companies had enough profit.
Crude oil rate in 2011 - 2013 was above 100 dollars,(the price of petrol was 58-72)
Now crude oil rate 60-65. The petrol price is 78 - 80
So what are going to tell us??

9073 2018-01-29 02:05:44 Waterproof fabric is adopted to Teflon treatment. When it met the oil and water, it will not adhere on the surface and not permeate clothes. At the same time, waterproof fabric has excellent breathability.
9074 2018-01-29 02:05:31 I guess using the CRA to rollback the oil and mining companies to disclosures counts?
9075 2018-01-29 02:05:26 She blinked, raising a brow amusingly at her friend, pointer finger directed towards the fry she had just eaten.

"Mhm, sure, whatever you say. Do you have any idea how much oil you just consumed with that single fry? Going healthy, my ass." »
9076 2018-01-29 02:05:23 Where is Mr. Softee,?, still nursing bad ankle, sore knee or deciding whether he is mentally ready for the NBA.

9077 2018-01-29 02:05:19 it's probably cheaper coming from Russia. But these tankers when leak are much worse than oil. the plume is almost invisible and spreads out fast and not containable.

9085 2018-01-29 02:04:24 The "French paradox" used to be equally intriguing. French have a relatively low incidence of CHD, while having a diet relatively rich in saturated fats such as foie gras, cheese, butter, yogurt as well as olive oil. It was wrongly attributed to the concomitant use of red wine.
9086 2018-01-29 02:04:24 Sponsored right? 

There are some benefits of using coconut oil, but not until say like that lah.

9099 2018-01-29 02:01:23 Wella luxe oil, bitches. Amazing.
9100 2018-01-29 02:01:18 In a pan mix half a large white onion (diced), 2-3 tablespoons of peanut/vegetable oil, and 2 teaspoons each of kosher salt, cumin, coriander, turmeric, nutmeg, and cocoa powder, 1/2 teaspoon each of powdered ginger, cardamom, paprika, mustard seed, cayenne and red pepper flakes.
9101 2018-01-29 02:01:17 Old habits is a bit much but the rest of the game is great. Also didn't like having to kill people with setting them on fire with oil. Should have made killing all phylakes a trophy.
9102 2018-01-29 02:01:07 I COULD BATHE IN ROSE HIP SEED OIL.
9103 2018-01-29 02:00:52 OIL DIFF: 4.12 -> 4.12
9104 2018-01-29 02:00:46 Mix 3 pints Black Beans with 11 lbs hummus. Mix into  Olive Oil. Fry. Serve over kale.

My mom died of Parkinsons; I'm not following in her footsteps.  You shouldn't either!  Don't let the music die!

9111 2018-01-29 01:59:45 Oh he thinks very highly of himself. You could even say he is prideful. He is also a scammer, hawking things snake oil salesmen refuse. He is nothing but trash.
9112 2018-01-29 01:59:19 He just stupid. Seriously. He knows nothing about science and doesn't want to learn or what  EPA actual stands for (Environmental PROTECTION Agency). He just knows that coal and oil companies are giving him and the GOP lots of money.
9113 2018-01-29 01:59:14 Continually dredging up the past for purpose of assigning blame for the present, benefits no one. A hindrance to progress in literal sense.

9123 2018-01-29 01:57:19 While I was gone my dad changed my oil, washed my car, & filled it up with gas 
9124 2018-01-29 01:56:59 Descendants of both those wronged and wrongdoers should forgive and move on. None are responsible for the past. Grudges are heavy millstones

9129 2018-01-29 01:55:34 Why would you buy bleached coconut oil for your food or skin or hair lmao , if you’re smart you buy organic for it all. So that’s not even an excuse.
9130 2018-01-29 01:55:12 A little too much oil but it did the job

9134 2018-01-29 01:54:44 I'm many episodes behind on #HighwayThruHell. Apparently the expansion into the oil fields failed but Jamie Davis sold his rotator?
9135 2018-01-29 01:54:41 Coconut oil does not work for my skin and it probably don’t work for half of yalls either ..... but y’all gonna use it anyway
9136 2018-01-29 01:54:39 Harper stronger on the economy? Don't make me laugh. The guy who was supposedly for diversification, instead he pushed for investment in the oil industry until it evaporated away and plunged our country into recession.

9150 2018-01-29 01:52:44 Unbelievable how much forest has been destroyed there for palm oil.
9151 2018-01-29 01:52:35 Well thank you for replying Graeme. Actually, you are wrong. It’s the same thing. Exactly. But we may agree about the “handful” of people - Anglo-American Banking and Oil Interests, Military-Industrial Complex - who control Congress.
9152 2018-01-29 01:52:26 Plan on doing this, but close to the time I'm due to have a cleaning at the dentist. Last home remedy was a total disaster. It involved turmeric, coconut oil and drops of peppermint oil.
9153 2018-01-29 01:52:13 Not enough. Alberta has a revenue shortfall because we have relied and are continuing to rely on oil revenue rather than Albertans to pay the bills.

9160 2018-01-29 01:50:20 The problem is the palm oil. Not even the sugar, fuck that. Palm oil harvesting is the reason deforestation is such a big issue.

9165 2018-01-29 01:49:47 @LeonJFletcher was just wondering and worried that Palm oil was being over-harvested and that the company wasn’t taking care of the plants ecosystem and growth cycle properly and it’s grown to a huge thread about fair trade/eco friendly lifestyle.

9174 2018-01-29 01:48:20 I know - I loved my grandmother (I bought the house when she died), but everyuthign she bought was horrible to clean. The kitchen floor is like oil when wet. When I mop,, I can't go in there for at least an hour.

9180 2018-01-29 01:47:40 Sorry you don't like me but mine was a piece of junk. Burned a gallon of oil a day until I finally convinced them to overhaul it at 400 hours. Afterward it only burned a quart a day and gave lots of trouble.
9181 2018-01-29 01:47:39 It's okay, makes my lashes grow nice but a little to heavy for me. I'm obsessed w my farsali 24k gold elixir drops! Best oil for me

9185 2018-01-29 01:46:22 It’s amazing how climate deniers think near-unanimous consensus among scientists on anthropogenic climate change can be so easily thwarted by a plucky band of billionaire septuagenarian oil barons like it’s an episode of Scooby-Doo.

9192 2018-01-29 01:45:29 You have to be careful and know who you’re buying from. Anything cheap and mass marketed isn’t always trustworthy. I don’t buy olive oil and only buy honey and maple syrup from family farms

9205 2018-01-29 01:44:09 Right on! But #govegan first. Most of the rain forest loss is for growing crops to feed factory farm animals. If you would avoid palm oil, why wouldn’t you stop eating meat, eggs,fish and dairy ?

9215 2018-01-29 01:43:10 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
9216 2018-01-29 01:43:07 NatGas is already seeing a nice fall right now. I doubt oil follows it for now. There is a chance we see a crude build this week. I suspect (no evidence to back it up) that we'll see 10 million + bpd next week in EIA. Chances are we're already there, and revisions will show it.
9217 2018-01-29 01:43:04 I’m somewhat of an expert with women.  Pour another 5 quarts of oil on the other side to even things out and then tell her it’s supposed to be like that.  Add...”It’s a mechanical thing”.
9218 2018-01-29 01:43:04 Al parecer la queja sobre Nutella venía de que usan palm oil y no de que es casi mitad de pura azúcar.
9219 2018-01-29 01:42:52  Hon, you don't make nearly enough money to talk to me like that. Now why don't you go change some oil and contemplate your own life choices, and leave others to their own.
9220 2018-01-29 01:42:12 Bitch is Beyoncé about to do something tonight? I need to re up on some castor oil because my edges finna he GONE
9221 2018-01-29 01:42:10 Interesting way to show ingredients of a tasty treat. Maybe you have never baked? I’m sad about the palm oil, but it’s in a lot of things nowadays.
9222 2018-01-29 01:41:54 This is what a "culture of death" looks like.  A bunch of greedy white patriarchs.  White oil, coal, and farm workers should already know that; 35 million African Americans certainly do.
9223 2018-01-29 01:41:45 So basically, it's pure ignorance that "oil" that scum of the earth ingredient, is causing deforestation and diabetes. 

Wait, what? Neither of those?
9224 2018-01-29 01:41:42 I will never understand why olive oil is so darn expensive. Like it’s a necessity so I’ll pay $11.99 but I won’t be happy about it
9225 2018-01-29 01:41:39 Oil fans are desperate? No, disappointed? Yes. But we all know this year was an anomaly, I’m sure they will only get better from this experience....not just you know, be mediocre at best for decades like the knucks

9244 2018-01-29 01:39:27 Can also be used to thwart criminality, enhance security,  insure validity of transactional records. Most tech is a double edged sword.
9245 2018-01-29 01:38:37 Is that because after you drink it within minutes it’s causes an Oil slick
9246 2018-01-29 01:38:29 Truck's oil change done.. Waterproofed boots.. There's a shit ton of stuff to do around the house but so little time y'all..

9250 2018-01-29 01:37:56 I guess this time jp seafood really can't be eaten anymore...but the oil slick is light and only on the surface. But fish also go to the water surface. Then again the sushi here is made from norwegian salmon usually
9251 2018-01-29 01:37:46 Vick’s or cocanut oil. Cure all’s 
9252 2018-01-29 01:37:45 Omg. It's worse than standard oil and gas production. There is definitely a propaganda machine on their side. The financial part of it makes no sense either. #SiteC aside there is so much LNG in the states and the OPEC countries haven't even started extracting. It will be cheap.
9253 2018-01-29 01:37:44 It’s interesting watching one piece of information come in through one member of the staff, work it’s way through the staff hierarchy, before being released to the public.  Seeing the bit about SPR and oil prices was incredible, especially how CJ handled it. #s2e10
9254 2018-01-29 01:37:41 Oil revenue and almost six-figure salaries for high school dropouts. The oil industry has innovated; they don’t need 12 people on a rig anymore because they can do the same work with two and a computer. Times have changed.
9255 2018-01-29 01:37:39 As long as it is a "good" oil like olive or avacado.  Same principle for dairy.  NON-FAT dairy should be banned.  You cannot absorb minerals, calcium efficiently from fat free dairy.  Have full fat milk products that have not been "processed"-I think homogenization is BAD too!
9256 2018-01-29 01:37:31 Google it for you for have an old milk carton wait for the oil to cool then put it in milk carton and toss it

9267 2018-01-29 01:35:13 The maple syrup was stolen yes. Honey and olive oil are diluted as More is sold than ever produced each year. Just saying these are all high commodity products because of health marketing and food network shows
9268 2018-01-29 01:35:06 the issue is the amount of sugar and the amount of palm oil (a ubiquitous ingredient that is also a huge factor in destroying the rainforests) I think most people can't visualize this sort of thing even if they look at the label, so seeing it like this is no doubt surprising.

9279 2018-01-29 01:34:12 I am kind of obsessed with those Bustle lists of cool shit to buy on Amazon. But they always leave me with the question: how many people are actually using oil diffusers ? Enough that portable USB diffusers and personal necklace diffusers are now a thing?

9302 2018-01-29 01:31:44 It's the same old story: the rich get richer while the poor get poorer. The oil industry alongside the incompetent and devious "Trump's best friend" Tories have widened the gap. On a good note, those at the top never stay at the top for long

9388 2018-01-29 01:19:09 So if one makes the roasted garlic and roasted garlic oil from the Cravings cookbook, how long will that last in the fridge?
9389 2018-01-29 01:19:07 And I'll add that the dollar is actually rising, and oil is rising too. I guess the MMs are just taking advantage to bid up prices. The loss of dumb money will be our celebration. I love it when these loons lose. Andy Hall fell. Andurand is next. Long live Jimboman!

9391 2018-01-29 01:18:42 Got burned up today at work by fryer oil because someone wasn't paying attention. Thank goodness for the quick response from the crew and glad I was wearing thick work pants that kept most of it off my skin #dickies #notdockers

9393 2018-01-29 01:18:33 hint: ppl in SEAsia, ie, Malaysia, Indonesia, want to enjoy the economic lifestyle that westerners enjoy. Even if palm oil is somehow banned, that won't change. Unless global wealth distribution is changed, the rain forests will still be chopped off.
9394 2018-01-29 01:18:32 You use the word "entirely" too often Andy. For example Europe does not depend entirely on foreign resources. Russia and Kosovo are rich in oil and minerals. Iron in Germany, copper and zinc in France and Spain, coal Ind fishing
9395 2018-01-29 01:17:59 In a sense a good thing - prices mirror economic growth. The stock market tanks when oil goes down. That chart from  
@TXoilCons shows a strengthening economy.

9406 2018-01-29 01:15:46 The deep state is basically the system whereby the government takes its orders form the bankers, multinational oil corporations, the military industrial complex, etc. and the people have no say in their government.

9408 2018-01-29 01:15:36 Oh no, my depressed butt stained my sweatshirt with food/oil so?  I guess I can keep this one for slubbing around at home and get another one that’s unstained?  I was thinking of getting a few more tbqh
9409 2018-01-29 01:15:34 Thats great now explain it topless with this baby oil on
9410 2018-01-29 01:15:34 From what I understand of the viewpoint of the indigenous ppl of Borneo, they want development, but on THEIR terms. The issue isn't palm oil per se, but ensuring that environmental damage is minimised, & as much as possible of the economic benefits should go to the indigenous
9411 2018-01-29 01:15:32 Or he can say gdp and markets up unemployment down tax cuts for everyone enemies fear the USA and businesses coming back. Oil exports up. Etc etc. but u keep watching mad dog and be blind to reality
9412 2018-01-29 01:15:12 BUT. doesn't necessarily follow that if palm oil were somehow banned, the forests (in eg Malaysia, Indonesia) would stay untouched (caveat, I'm Msian, so conflicted on the palm oil issue).

9415 2018-01-29 01:14:54 yep. that point is also more complex than presented by most well meaning westerners concerned abt the environment. Definitely deforestation occurs, to plant oil palms.
9416 2018-01-29 01:14:52 5:10 pm - I've been planning this all w/e got home n got out the garlic I used to flavor my thc oil, sucking n chewing on it now. Hypothesis - I'll be higher than I've ever been later tonight. I'll update this thread every 30

while you destroy habitat leading directly to the extinction of species, 
all for palm oil, but really all for $$$$. This is now your branding across the planet. Proud of it?
9418 2018-01-29 01:14:44 take oil of oregano, garlic, vitamin D and cinnamon caplets and gelcaps. Read up about these 4 items. They are cheap and harmless. It works. Have to take it every day.
9419 2018-01-29 01:14:44 all of a sudden i see hella people roasting on people who uses coconut oil as skin care. everybody is different. if it works for them it works for them. y’all just on bandwagon hate lmfao
9420 2018-01-29 01:14:38 Just got home from Wal-Mart. Got 5qts of oil and sat it in my backseat...you may already know wher this is headed...
Car pulls out in front of me, I hit brakes. Oil slides out of seat and lands in floor behind driver seat.

9445 2018-01-29 01:11:26 You forgot when Israel attacked a US ship in 67 killing and wounding quite a few with no response. You also forgot Iran took those hostages to get rid of a US installed puppet Shah so we could basically rob their oil reserves.
9446 2018-01-29 01:11:26 How about we use glow sticks next time?  Set each one in the 4 places you have here. If I fly fast with a torch the oil inside can spill out and catch my mane or fur on fire.

9469 2018-01-29 01:09:32 I like leeks, but I only ever make soup with them. They work well for that, maybe better than onions. My mom though pointed out on the phone that you can sautee them like vegetables, with some olive oil and tomato sauce in the style of Greek 'lathera'.

9545 2018-01-29 00:59:03 You can increase the salt a bit, I never go beyond 1/8 of a tsp. I brush the top and edges of the crust with either seasoned olive oil, plain olive... then sprinkle garlic powder, Parmesan cheese, dried oregano, basil, sesame seed around the edge. Some cheese on the bottom works.
9546 2018-01-29 00:58:49 I lost 5 pounds pretty much immediately after I realized how many of those empty calories I was having every day and went back to black.  (But, man, they were tasty, immersion blended with butter, cinnamon, coconut oil, chocolate powder, etc).

9575 2018-01-29 00:52:39 What @realDonaldTrump has proven is that 35% of the American population are complete idiots who fall for a snake oil salesman conman like trump.
9576 2018-01-29 00:51:35 Exactly.  Some 1970s frogs-in-a-well, whose profit lay in oil&war decided not to use the #EXXONKnew report to fund research & back innovation/ competition & steal a march on competitors, but decided on oil&war. Have shaped this

9829 2018-01-29 00:11:29 @BBoeser16 I’m a loyal to the Oil kinda girl but you have a new fan in Alberta!!

9834 2018-01-29 00:10:16 Renewables will push on and become a very large part of the worlds energy supply for more reasons other then Co2 emissions. How else can a country without coal and oil Guarantee supply. Strategically as well as Environmentally it is the future.
9835 2018-01-29 00:10:09 To cook using as little fat or oil as possible, none at all if we can get away with it with our new special stone "frying" pan and steamed food. tagging @susiedarlo and @BishTAWN

9837 2018-01-29 00:10:03 America's oil exports are booming -- and lifting prices
9838 2018-01-29 00:09:57  We're like oil and water, we just don't mix
Like a square peg in a round hole, it just ain't gon' fit
We're like gasoline and fire, dangerous when lit  
'Cause we get to blackin' out
And we start burning everything down

9839 2018-01-29 00:09:56 Coconut oil is getting such a bad rep and I feel attacked. I'm not tryna say ur using it wrong I'm just making a statement that I have never seen people not like it.
9840 2018-01-29 00:09:06 i just got an oil diffuser so once i learn the art of essential oils its over for you hoes
9841 2018-01-29 00:09:02 Ok. Have fun. I'll be watching something interesting instead.
9842 2018-01-29 00:08:52 (laughing way too much) I think throwing oil on it would just spread the burn because its still on fire.
9843 2018-01-29 00:08:48 Soon as I saw everybody hopping on that coconut oil wave. I got off it
9844 2018-01-29 00:08:43 "@CNN: Oil hits $60 a barrel for the first time in 2.5 years it's opd
9845 2018-01-29 00:08:35 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado.

9850 2018-01-29 00:07:13 Dana just said her face is so oily she can take the oil and put it in her car and go for a ride 
9851 2018-01-29 00:07:10 Considering how much energy we waste (oil, fracking, illegal mining, wars, pointless financial intermediaries and all the exuberance that comes with that sector etc) to prop up the current financial system. 

I'd say bitcoin is infinitely more energy friendly than the status quo.
9852 2018-01-29 00:07:02 I need to get up early tomorrow and get a oil change tho so I can go
9853 2018-01-29 00:07:01 try oil of oregano. don't take the liquid directly as it burns, but take it in capsule form.
9854 2018-01-29 00:06:55 The only non-mechanical part is a portion of its face. Only eats raw meat soaked in machine oil.

9862 2018-01-29 00:06:04 自動調合すっごく助かる。弾の素材もたくさん手に入るのでガンナー楽しそう
9863 2018-01-29 00:05:47 Good. Many in the oil and gas world share it and believe it. Truly ugly, really stupid stuff. But its gospel for some of them.
9864 2018-01-29 00:05:42 Lmao his oil money made city somewhat relevant smh
9865 2018-01-29 00:05:23 Roll out an oil barrel for him to cry into.

9868 2018-01-29 00:05:12 I had a bowl of avocado (dressed with salt, pepper, lime juice and olive oil) and a protein shake before coming to the gym.

This is going to be difficult.

9871 2018-01-29 00:04:42 The companies that do manufacture in US charge 2x the cost of import. This tariff is for the benefit of oil & gas company donors.

9875 2018-01-29 00:04:05 There is a good model yet to be seen to penalize oil companies who cause coastal disasters. Fining a company a pittance compared to its annual income is unacceptable.
9876 2018-01-29 00:04:04 Me and relationships right now is like oil and water. Not interested. I’m just trying to live my best life Lol.
9877 2018-01-29 00:03:45 Communism, oil and allies.
9878 2018-01-29 00:03:43 PSA to everyone: do NOT eat the sausage on a stick at TSU arena.

Omg I think they deep fry it because it straight up tasted like a deep fryer. It's basically a sponge of frying oil.
You're better off just chugging a bottle of Crisco.

Tummy hurts. 
9879 2018-01-29 00:03:31 We can confirm that for all of our liquid filled phone cases we only use Cosmetic Grade Mineral Oil, which has been laboratory tested. We hope this provides you with the reassurance needed :) Team Typo

9886 2018-01-29 00:02:09 The 'oil boom' also gives the US monumental negligent & egregious environmental violations, pollution & degradation of communities. The 'boom' has killed & maimed workers, as well as irreparably done damage to workers health. The Bakken, start there.
9887 2018-01-29 00:02:05 Never leave the house without oil wipes lol
9888 2018-01-29 00:02:03 "It smells like cardamom oil." -Jesse
9889 2018-01-29 00:01:58 ok so i know everyone hates coconut oil now but is it bad for ur hair??? i don’t think so
9890 2018-01-29 00:01:54 How about this then.  Bitcoin creates demand for electricity which is an alternative fuel for oil.
9891 2018-01-29 00:01:31 Maybe tea tree oil caused his autism.

9893 2018-01-29 00:01:13 It’s get out our way oil gas uranium and greed Trump doesn’t give a damn he’s getting paid
9894 2018-01-29 00:00:53 2. Only hire for services you don't care to learn. I am not interested in becoming an expert at changing my own oil, so I am more than happy to pay someone to do that.
9895 2018-01-29 00:00:53 The Chris Packham thing

English folk..brilliant at moralising and getting on high horses about palm oil/habitat destruction in foreign countries

Not so brilliant at giving a **** that vast areas of Northern England are about to be turned into a climate wrecking #fracking zone
9896 2018-01-29 00:00:37 yep. have skin that needs all the moisture it can get. 100% organic jojoba oil has been my lifesaver honestly. just looking for a new good moisturizer to match.
9897 2018-01-29 00:00:26 OIL DIFF: 4.2 -> 4.27
9898 2018-01-29 00:00:14 Olive, jojoba, and sweet almond oils are all wonderful elixirs for hair. If your hair is thick and heavy, coconut oil works wonders.
9899 2018-01-29 00:00:06 BS. This mkt is rising on a tide of easy money, cheap oil & McConnell/Ryan tax stim despite Trump's awful trade/immig policy & geopol risk.
