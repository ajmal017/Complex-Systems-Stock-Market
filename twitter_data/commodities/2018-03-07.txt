46 2018-03-07 21:49:56 It's truly astonishing. Another aspect of this is that if babies are seen as commodities to be bought and sold, will parents want refunds because they're not satisfied?

56 2018-03-07 21:21:11 it can't be focused, it has to be by product to work.  they are commodities, and countries will shift production to other countries unless it's by product.  SK did that with appliances.

129 2018-03-07 17:02:33 `Bodies, time, energy, creativity, love — all become commodities to be priced and sold. Alienation reigns. There is no room for sustained contemplation and little interest in public morality; everything collapses down to the level of the atomized individual. ` 

Wonderful line.
130 2018-03-07 16:59:21 Heard from a friend earlier that another analyst is out there saying, "They (China, Mexico) need us more than we need them." That is wrong on so many levels. Unless, of course, we put caps on US production of all commodities.
131 2018-03-07 16:57:51 Had the pleasure of meeting Gary Cohn when working together at Goldman ... very smart guy with a very interesting background in commodities and navigated his route to the top with aplomb. Interesting resignation from him likely due to irreconcilable differences around free trade.
132 2018-03-07 16:50:43 Commodities and tokens both have a duel function. Investors can wager on the price of a barrel of oil and oil can also can be refined into utility products like gas. Many tokens share a similar duel function: speculation and utility in a tokenized network. #cftc vs #sec
133 2018-03-07 16:50:39 My guess is that when FinCEN wrote it's 2013 guidance it didn't contemplate that SEC/CFTC would view some virtual currencies as securities/commodities.

141 2018-03-07 16:19:39 Ben, can you explain your reasoning? I would think that commodities (other than gold) would suffer if trade/the global economy slumps. Less demand for oil/metals/etc
142 2018-03-07 16:12:31 You are correct @CorbeauxInvest . I have for the last decade or so been calling those and other commodities #strategic #energy #minerals  because they are just about to change the world. Note that this perspective goes beyond #Resource #Nationalism. #lithium

178 2018-03-07 14:10:06 Just when you praise the gov’t for raising the prices of commodities to spend in building public structures, just remember that there are farmers all over the country who receive 13 pesos for a day’s work in a farm. That’s $0.25 a day! They can’t even buy their own product.

244 2018-03-07 11:20:24 I never said there was no trading or infrastructure in Africa, just that Europeans created the markets for many of the commodities we've been discussing. We could have a more civil discourse if you would stop putting words in my mouth.
245 2018-03-07 11:14:29 Always testing laws governing your continuing dabbling in your businesses still, stock market manipulating, commodities meddling, and using your position to support others in business and even your own businesses.  You just are corrupt to your orange bones.

293 2018-03-07 07:10:19 The survey also shows that many women have stigma over some SRH commodities #SRH4ruralwomenandgirls @HAImedicines @ACHEST1
294 2018-03-07 07:09:22 Chinese demand rebounded on commodities because they’re consuming commodities to produce more goods for foreign markets. The final destination of these commodities is still export oriented. That’s the linkage, as I understand it.
295 2018-03-07 07:05:32 The SRH Commodities survey conducted by @HAImedicines and @hepsuganda indicates persistent stock-outs of SRH comdties #SRH4ruralgirlsandwomen
296 2018-03-07 06:57:54 2) I don't follow commodities outside energy&steel that closely, but for those it's a story of Chinese demand rebound.
297 2018-03-07 06:56:23 2) On commodities, I didn’t dig too deeply into the numbers last time I saw something about it, but if I recall correctly a lot of that demand increase is linked to foreign consumption. Yes, domestic demand drives up commodity prices, but commodities are intermediary goods.
298 2018-03-07 06:51:47 Chinese growth over the last decade has been astronomical & played a major role in supporting the global recovery after the ‘08/9 crisis. It tends to positively influence global stock markets, demand for oil & commodities, & the AUD, as China is Australia’s main trading partner.
299 2018-03-07 06:51:11 According to KM China would be capitalist or in the verge where there is exploitation through the method of producing of commodities for the market. This is not NEP is plain capitalist market economy.
300 2018-03-07 06:47:06 But dont you think their is still earning potential in commodities and earnings are not topped out.
301 2018-03-07 06:39:39 They should go to Greenhill as well. Counterfeit commodities are very rampant. Also they should start policing those who imports  these commodities.
302 2018-03-07 06:37:57 Even though the latest trend has the #Dollar falling and commodities prices rising, I expect that those trends will reverse soon and the dollar will go up, gold and commodities will go down and the #stockmarket will enter into a #bearmarket

304 2018-03-07 06:11:33 @ClassicFM973 Lagos State govt should always consult b4 increasing such as any increase would bring an increment in commodities and rental.
305 2018-03-07 06:05:04 Yes the possibilities are limitless. Continued growth in China will do good for other economies e.g. SA commodities.
306 2018-03-07 06:03:58 I agree 100% except we are placing too much emphasis on technology at the expense of research. Technology will redefine how commodities are marketed and traded but we must first understand how the markets function. That is the thrust if our work with agritech start-ups in Kenya.

333 2018-03-07 03:00:48 Wow. This seems strangely hard to understand for an avowed capitalists. Abolish the 2nd Amendment and treat guns like all other commodities. Let a free market do its thing.
334 2018-03-07 02:53:14 But that doesn't explain why the USD is generally weak and the CAD is trading at 8 month lows.. 

In the long run, sure. But we market grain in a short window of the economic cycles, and with the USD inverse to commodities, does that really matter as much to #CdnAg grain prices?
335 2018-03-07 02:51:34 Huhu and you think that minimum wage is enough? Sure train law wont increase prices for all products pero yung basic commodities, tumataas ang presyo. Dun nahihirapan ang mga mahihirap.
336 2018-03-07 02:44:25 Manufacturing also boosts #GDP more than imported equivalent goods, which net to zero as NEX by becoming PCE, but also require GDI for equipment, factories, patents, etc.  We sacrifice manufactures to commodities at our peril.

357 2018-03-07 00:46:26 They contribute to the production of value, which is always a relationship in Marx. They are sold. They can enter the market again at a higher price, being rare commodities. Being objects of no value in the Marxist sense, their price is technically arbitrary.
