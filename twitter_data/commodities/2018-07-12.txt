40 2018-07-12 21:34:40 Like, okay, the Soylent Green thing wasn't just about the final twist

It was this whole big overall message about how all of society became optimized for grueling labor, people turned into commodities, the simple joys in life used up and priced out for the average person
41 2018-07-12 21:33:32 I hope d leadership of Kwaracare will take seriously availability of essential drugs and other health commodities supllies are timely replenished that will cater of emergency cases.
42 2018-07-12 21:12:28 Exactly! Low value agri commodities seldom worth moving long distance. Finished foodstuffs may be, but tariffs kill that option. And tariff-free applies only to very poorest nations. Many countries poor enough to receive aid yet deemed rich enough for tariffs. Crazy!
43 2018-07-12 20:59:03 Positive July #CropReport on #corn and #wheat today. But a negative report on #soybeans. Also a technical #keyreversal on corn.
44 2018-07-12 20:58:12 Disgusting show with a hidden agenda of reinforcing the idea to the general population that women are  second class commodities, to be controlled and ruled over. She should be ashamed to be a part of it.

47 2018-07-12 20:48:01 Ask questions how those promising change will fund the Dams? How they will bring the prices of essential commodities down? What steps they will take to increase collection of taxes from the business community?
48 2018-07-12 20:46:45 Michael Marcus has been referenced a lot and my father used to mention a Big Mouth Bass and a Trout, both hedge fund and oil and gas/commodities references.
49 2018-07-12 20:42:58 soybean and corn are commodities. super suspicious about the price of these two will fall because of china stops buying US corn or soybean.
50 2018-07-12 20:41:55 Part of the set. Soon it's airspace, rail infrastructure and ports to go with land, commodities and reserve bank.
51 2018-07-12 20:39:56 1/2. it is impossible for commodities to go down in price with a rise in inflation ... mainstream media said that inflation is due to labor costs but household income does not cover the costs of living. Here is a big lie...
52 2018-07-12 20:23:54 At 2,774.02...The Nasdaq Composite: at 42.49 points, 7,716.61... Both commodities and oil took a hit... * Monsanto to be flooded with thousands of cancer related lawsuits...The federal judge in the case ruled to allow 3 expert
53 2018-07-12 20:21:20 Exxon plans to boost capex every year from now until 2025...Almost all on traditional oil and gas mega projects around the world...The company has no plans to follow global rivals into wind, solar, or battery storage.

64 2018-07-12 19:05:24 Moronic. Chaser or propaganda merchant or both. Commodities are heading to new lows imo but already beaten down and due a decent bounce beforehand on a drop in the DXY to the 92s imho, then fall again as the dollar spikes to 96 or as high as 99 before collapse to sub 80.

76 2018-07-12 18:22:01 Breaking inflation also took away much of the Soviet Union's hard cash flow from foreign sales of commodities. This was a conscious part of Reagan's strategy, which a CIA official named Herbert Meyer explained to me at the time.

78 2018-07-12 18:04:03 “Wooing” is a cultural creation with an ugly past. It’s not rooted in some false idea that human biology determines behavior.

88 2018-07-12 17:28:06 kind of made me think of postones conception of "superfluous labour" here but the whole point of that is it isn't about the concrete character of any one person's job, its abt macroeconomic policy designed to valorize commodities that couldnt otherwise be sold

121 2018-07-12 15:10:31 Excellent article.  Why though did the farm bill push commodities?

123 2018-07-12 14:55:04 Author erroneously  conflates socialism with communism. They are different. Communism and dictatorships treat ppl poorly. Capitalism treats ppl as commodities which means, also poorly. Socialism, in the strict use of the term, has never been implemented. It's for overall good.
124 2018-07-12 14:50:50 Why. Only connection most traders have to the commodities market are that they are consumers.  Conflict of interest???  MAYYYYYYYBE

131 2018-07-12 14:29:35 The founder of Moonpig lived and worked in Russia, trading on their commodities market for a living. That's more evidence than the left have and are accusing Trump of collusion with. The left is Russia funded. (Left logic, aka left the building logic.)
132 2018-07-12 14:29:27 Gold has gotten pounded down same as grains, its an all out assault on commodities.
133 2018-07-12 14:15:16 All commodities are heavily influenced by geopolitics and macro economic shifts. Oil is no exception nor it is more prone to these changes.

135 2018-07-12 14:12:25 Still a ton of ambiguity/unproven commodities among that group. You at least know Howard has a stronger TE to compete for targets with, a top WR in Evans, DJax, and the potential emergence with Godwin. To me there are a lot more barriers for Howard. And probably worse QB play.

145 2018-07-12 13:53:52 Countries who have many natural resources and export these to other countries builds wealth. Those countries have to pay for those commodities by something of value to the exporter. Not by its own currency notes as they are valueless but by a tangible value of something.

148 2018-07-12 13:48:43 Silver lining? Milk and cheese prices will start coming down as tariffs kill exports of those commodities. We’ll be filling swimming pools with milk soon. At least until the small dairies go out of business. Then prices will soar again.
149 2018-07-12 13:47:56 the float in commodities is never zero there are no real checks and balances.  In equities everything should theoretically tally zero in the end. Commodities you cant do that.  So when there is a conflict of interest it’s like casino night. And the farmer gets screwed.  So NO

152 2018-07-12 13:32:59 You can't go more wrong than this. Prices (market values) ARE regulated by labor time according to Marxism. Marx notes that with labor vouchers, the principle regulating the exchange of commodities remains. The difference is distribution instead of exchange.

158 2018-07-12 13:11:33 As the world needs to ready for an enormous commodity cycle, must of the investment community, including the financial media, pays little attention. This, in the oddest of ways, will exacerbate the upward and shock movement upwards of said commodities.

Long game, metals.
159 2018-07-12 13:05:24 if we farmers do better it will mean the country will suffer from food price inflation.  our prices for commodities and livestock have not gone up.  the middleman and sellers have gouged the consumers.
160 2018-07-12 13:05:03 Funny thing with this, still a lot of die hard DDS would believe this is true. That nothing is wrong with the economy. They can deny that even there is a 1 pesos fare increase, higher price of commodities. Nothing is wrong.
161 2018-07-12 13:00:25 Commodities are a very difficult investing product.  Boom or bust cycles. Unlike owning index stocks which constantly filter out the losers and try to incorporate the new and improved companies.
162 2018-07-12 12:58:53 Fake News. This shows the Australian economy move to a commodities-based economy. Our massive mining and primary industries are not employee-intensive. Service economies like the UK are far more staff-based.
163 2018-07-12 12:56:41 always makes me laugh when geeks that hate socialism get mad that video game studios treat their games as commodities like "I h8 this game because all it is is the company trying 2 get as much money as possible" yeah no shit dude! capitalism isn't very nice to art lol
164 2018-07-12 12:55:13 Russia can't print money. It can only sell minerals, petro, other commodities (well, and great arms and aircraft). Its economy is the size of Italy's (or, half the size of Germany's). Germany chooses to be a vassal state of an inferior, vulnerable, bellicose strategic rival.
165 2018-07-12 12:51:28 Who has ties with Brock & Rothschild...yeah, that’s not raising any red flags.... There are procurers of children ...this isn’t conspiracy. Children are commodities to be sold over & over.  Never knew pizza shop owners to be so politically influential & rich ...
166 2018-07-12 12:46:47 So would you please explain to trump and fans that the reason the EU doesnt buy US corn and soybeans is because the are GM crops and are banned in Europe. Has nothing to do with trade deficits. The Chinese market is where the bulk of these commodities were exported.

180 2018-07-12 12:12:24 I understand the said consequences of a trade war. But the sell off in oil yesterday, I believe, was a little extreme.

228 2018-07-12 07:31:52 Thats why they keep on increasing the prices of commodities every now and then?! Sad...

commodities are in a waiting game.

233 2018-07-12 07:15:55 The honest truth of the matter is that those lessons were preparing us for reasoning and not being effective at determining defective products.

242 2018-07-12 06:30:02 Tories have just voted to take away animal sentience from UK law!

283 2018-07-12 02:58:49 The problem is that farm products aren’t like many other commodities, they go from field to market immediately. Things like liquors can be stored for a while & sold after things resolve, but it’s impossible for farmers to store fields of grain. Margins are NARROW!
