52 2018-03-27 23:35:28 I believe sensible libs are wanting to raise the purchase age to 21, outlawing what they like to call assault rifles aka AR15, tougher back ground checks, drop high capacity mags and bump stocks... what did I miss?

57 2018-03-27 23:33:14 The main indexes, and a number of individual stocks would now suggest... no. Such a break would offer a hit of the 200dma in the $27s. Not pretty. Earnings will still come in fine though... so the bold will be buying... if it gets that low.

65 2018-03-27 23:29:51 So there's a huge debate on certain stocks right now, and I appreciate everyones point of view, however at what point does it turn from 'looking out for retail investors' (such as myself), to simply down-ramping? Isn't it all about DYOR?
66 2018-03-27 23:29:50 Yes. I don’t have any stocks at the moment though
67 2018-03-27 23:29:50 Surrender them?  Very very few people would. It's like the bump stock law in denver.. They made it illegal to posess them and people are required to turn them in. Guess how many people have turned them in? 0. That's just stupid bump stocks...

The fact they don't trade at a super high premium multiple, & stocks like Twitter and other high multiple ones do, is a perfect example of what's wrong with this market in general.

116 2018-03-27 23:10:54 Obama's Economy has been growing steadily at 2% GDP for 9 years.

118 2018-03-27 23:09:08 I would guesstimate 30pct of gpu revenue. They had a volume and price benefit. I expect a violent reversal shortly and massive oversupply of gpu. Growth stocks don’t look great when instead of growing 30 they shrink 30.
119 2018-03-27 23:08:28 You say that, but last friday the President and Attorney General rail roaded a ban on bump stocks down our throats. Overstepping the ATF, who's job it is to rule on the legality of such items and had done so 3 times already saying they were not in violation of any laws.

124 2018-03-27 23:05:36 True.
He dumped thousands of shares.

BTW FB stocks were 185.09 on March 16 and have been dropping ever since, only yesterday FB stocks went up by 0.30 after dropping 8%

126 2018-03-27 23:05:22 Put your stocks in Ammunition suppliers quick !!!!
127 2018-03-27 23:04:59 No, no , no.  Obviously not!  We can enforce gun laws, restrict weapons of war, beef up background checks, restrict age to 21 and ban bump stocks.  Smart and safer, right?  We all want the mass shootings to stop.  Let’s start there.
128 2018-03-27 23:04:07 I’m all for amendments....not repeal....bump stocks, massive magazines, etc.....and yes, it is a great answer because it’s a fact. Whether you want to like it or not doesn’t matter....fact over emotion.

130 2018-03-27 23:03:45 Oh how naive they Are!
1..THEY didn't get the Bump stock ban, That was POTUS' Idea long before they ever thought of it.
2.  The technology for bump stocks can be replicated ANYWHERE, ANYTIME NOW. Without premade ones.
3. If you're pro gun confiscation...you belong in Germany.1938
131 2018-03-27 23:03:42 Bought a lot of stocks in corporate cannabis so go get ur medical marijuana card people 
132 2018-03-27 23:03:33 Picked the wrong week to invest in video game and other tech stocks 
133 2018-03-27 23:02:43 About twenty stocks, but probably half of them are indices or long hold positions.
134 2018-03-27 23:02:33 Gun owner and CC in NY. I'm for sensible gun regulations, background checks, no gun show or private sales, waiting periods, ban high capacity mags and bump stocks, permits for handguns, 5 round max rifle mag, mandatory training, rules for storage
135 2018-03-27 23:02:15 The time to accumulate is when market is showing signs of strength.  Leading stocks will start to form constructive bases.  The market today is the opposite where we have leading stocks starting to break down.  Best to remain patient and let market find a bottom.  it'l take time
136 2018-03-27 23:02:04 I don't think futures trader live in a single directional camp. If they are long only, what is the point of using futures? Jjust be in stocks.
137 2018-03-27 23:01:33 How much of your net worth is in LT stocks?
138 2018-03-27 23:01:33 Try again.  Apart from  fishermen who are really limited by fish stocks not eu. Which industry will benefit?  How many finance, automotive, aerospace and space jobs will be lost? We already established you want to sacrifice all the farmers.  How many more?
139 2018-03-27 23:01:16 How many of you #Crypto Traders diversified and trade stocks? Vs. the other way around.
140 2018-03-27 23:01:04 None of your so-called sensible gun regulation would have stopped any of the terrible mass shootings of the recent past.  Bad people will appropriate weapons of any type if they are motivated to do so.  Yes, this includes bump stocks.  Defence of ourselves is our 2A right.
141 2018-03-27 23:00:52 Do  you buy your stocks on your smart phone? How many trades do you average per month?
142 2018-03-27 23:00:09 Dow up ~ 700 points yesterday, stocks up X%.  Dow down -350 points today, stocks -3X%.   $SPY
143 2018-03-27 22:59:54 Why stock market is chocking? Is there a invisible hands behind this, big corporations can buy back stocks in lower price with their big/ fat tax cut surplus cash?
144 2018-03-27 22:59:49 Remember when his wife claimed they were poor in college because they had to sell a few of the stocks their parents gave them one time?
145 2018-03-27 22:59:15 But all stocks go down in bear markets
146 2018-03-27 22:59:00 Speaking, isnt he trying to ban your bump stocks and infringe on your constitutional rights? 
147 2018-03-27 22:58:27 Protect second amendment doesn't mean bump stocks hit volume magazines, AR 15's , age limits to purchase, waiting periods for gun sales and on line sales . What have I left out? Scalia would think you guys have gone totally off the rails
148 2018-03-27 22:58:12 This recent earnings season has been pretty spectacular... don't earnings drive stocks?! $ES_F $NQ_F $YM_F ...or does fake news have a larger impact?!
149 2018-03-27 22:58:09 U.S. markets close sharply lower as tech stocks lead late sell-off
150 2018-03-27 22:56:15 Bonds or stocks?  Might have a case buying bonds here if we roll over.  Sell out when we bottom.  What was your advice?
151 2018-03-27 22:55:44 He’s right Barbara the SKS, M1 Carbine. Ruger Mini, Thompson, Remington  carbines for example are far less dangerous because they shoot slower bigger bullets that blow big holes in people and are made of real wood.  Black plastic stocks and a 223 round  super duper deadly 
152 2018-03-27 22:55:33 We believe as the world equities especially tech growth stocks is overvalued, now the rotation to good dividend value investing stocks.
153 2018-03-27 22:53:14 I got asked by a 9th grader how to buy stocks.  I advised her to not buy stocks but get a custodial account and get some index funds with @Vanguard_Group.  That's from our economics lesson from 2 weeks ago.  I put a seed in her head and it's growing.
154 2018-03-27 22:52:44 People call me and ask what to do if stocks don’t go the way you thought they should go... you know, up

160 2018-03-27 22:47:09 nice sentiment change
The latest survey from the Conference Board showed that only a net 6% of respondents are expecting stocks to rise in the coming months, down from 30% in January.
161 2018-03-27 22:46:56 Stocks to Watch: TGT, AAN, AAPL. Read our in-depth analysis for more.
162 2018-03-27 22:46:55 #Stocks do nooot look healthy rn, be safe out there. $DOW showing what seems to be a bubble top with these drops the last few weeks.  Does the complacency stage sound familiar? 
163 2018-03-27 22:46:46 Can you not comment on stocks and the economy?  I’ve noticed that every time you talk about it, the stock market plunges.
164 2018-03-27 22:46:19 Who said Bitcoin was risky. These Apple and Microsoft stocks were no better. @jimcramer @cnn @coinbase
165 2018-03-27 22:44:59 We'd be hard pressed to find people against banning bump stocks. Semi-Automatic long guns are nothing new. The Black Ones LOOK scary, but are no different than the hunter's rifles that teens have kept in their pickups for decades.  Oh, and they come in pink.
166 2018-03-27 22:44:41 Ay ambot ah, ka dako gid ya mag hatag dividend ang companya nga ni raletive sa price sng stocks nila ah 
167 2018-03-27 22:42:46 So TECH (*Nasdaq $NQ_F drops what -3%)...?! ***All because @CitronResearch is trying to make money for themselves and other aligned hedge funds on shorting / exploting $TWTR & $FB... Doesn't seem like a justifiable reason for more than 70% of stocks to be dragged down today...
168 2018-03-27 22:41:28 Dude's being very literal w/ terminology just to sidestep that bump stocks allow semi-autos to get off very nearly as many rounds as automatics
169 2018-03-27 22:39:36 Tita @min_bernardo kailan po kya mgkakaroon ng stocks sa ilo2?!
170 2018-03-27 22:38:51 Sorry I stand corrected months end last day was today . Since Friday is a holiday . So hopfully selling pressure is off on most stocks
171 2018-03-27 22:38:19 @realDonaldTrump So yesterday you bragged about the stocks, you haven’t said crap about it today? Lol
172 2018-03-27 22:37:40 Back looking at the most loved stocks...

$FB sucked back close to that 150 level whilst $GOOGL almost saying hello to 1000 again.  Big round number levels / interesting times.
173 2018-03-27 22:37:34 The weakness today was more telling than yesterday's rally. The same stocks which bounced on low volume yesterday broke down today on heavier volume As leadership continues to come under pressure, the rally attempts will likely get more feeble. Let the corrective process play out
174 2018-03-27 22:37:02 What is the current WHITE HOUSE definition of "soar"?... PO##S is silent on stocks tanking..but 1st to blow farts when it rises.
NO COLLUSION...
175 2018-03-27 22:35:56 Housing starts and permits in the US were "well below even the most pessimistic predictions" in Feb. Perhaps worth keeping a close eye on retail stocks as well
176 2018-03-27 22:35:54 “While stocks last” bet there’s warehouses full of it 
177 2018-03-27 22:35:43 @realDonaldTrump what happened to the stocks?  No apologies??  You only say something when they go up, not when you screw up.
178 2018-03-27 22:35:24 There already have been school shootings using handguns. It’s just much harder to kill large numbers of people in a short amount of time. Banning assault type rifles and bump stocks will make it more difficult. That’s it.
179 2018-03-27 22:34:59 True but it's bump stocks that make them rapid fire and I do believe that the bump stocks should be illegal
180 2018-03-27 22:33:28 I agree to an extent, but even if stocks don't go down they would of let their biggest community down. For them to be silent on all of this if it's fake would show how much they don't care about the cod community as there willing to let us get our hopes up over nothing.
181 2018-03-27 22:32:49 @Oryegrg12 absolutely some of these companies in penny stocks u just dont know when they will do an offering. better be safe then sorry.
182 2018-03-27 22:32:46 Today: Dow tanked. AGAIN. 
 Stocks: tanked. AGAIN. @realDonaldTrump where's your Tweet about that??
183 2018-03-27 22:32:44 @SenDeanHeller Please do NOT vote for HR5087. I don't mind banning bump stocks but reading it further it bans rifles and pistols. That is taking away our 2nd Ammendment!!!
184 2018-03-27 22:32:40 Off the top of my head, ban weapons of war.  Change the age requirement to 21 for all types of guns.  Ban bump stocks. Fix the gun show loophole.  Limit the number of guns an individual can own.
185 2018-03-27 22:32:11 Yes, a suppressor doesn’t make a gun more deadly, just doesn’t make you go deaf. A sight doesn’t either, just more accurate. A stock adjusts the gun to fit your arm length. Bump stocks only make the gun short faster, which a normal person could do. A pistol grip doesn’t either.
186 2018-03-27 22:31:31 Love mall stocks and hate energy really???? Mall stocks over energy??? I'm just ... Without words. I know I know that's what the Cramer lemmings want to here. Mall stocks?

195 2018-03-27 22:22:28 You’re right. I guess I generalized what they said at the march about they’ll give us an inch with bump stocks, and we’ll take a mile.
My general distaste for David Hogg is grounded in a few of things. He says he wants to help bring about changes in laws, yet hung up on Prez.
196 2018-03-27 22:19:19 The pullback in stocks is a great buying opportunity, according to Sark Manchez. Wow that was easy

198 2018-03-27 22:19:14 So I made the decision to move my Facebook app to a folder I don’t use much on my phone to see if I was more productive.

Today I...
Invested in stocks
Learned more about building credit 
Learned about the history of black wealth
And got introduced to a IRA

201 2018-03-27 22:18:38 Hopefully you don't mean in general, but not in every instance.  All Americans should be disappointed by executive orders to ban bump stocks, or signing the #OmnibusBill or when he chooses war hawks as advisers in foreign policy matters. We need patriots, not sheep.

I want Safety in America from Gun Violence.

I want the following:
Ban Assault Weapons
Ban High Capacity Clips
Ban Bump Stocks/modifications multi burst trigger
Hold Gun manufacturers legally liable. 
Require updated tech safety
205 2018-03-27 22:15:28 Played my first iron-man today against @SSB4_Arch the Palutena main.
The ordeal really showcased just how far I am away from that skill level. 
I barely conquered the first row, only taking 28 stocks with my 110.
Hella fun tho tbh, and Arch is just amazing at the game as a whole.
206 2018-03-27 22:15:08 Thinking about weed stocks. Invest in the things you love
207 2018-03-27 22:14:25 Tomorrow's another day. Weekly charts give a great idea about the bigger picture. In this environment know your key pivots and the volume to drive your stock up or down. Focus on a few stocks. Just my humble opinion. Trade less and find the right setups. SPY, QQQ, HAL, BA for me.
208 2018-03-27 22:14:16 AIRBNB stocks going down!
209 2018-03-27 22:13:56 Those of us who are heavily invested in cryptos and precious metals mining stocks are saying, "Goood, goood, dollar, puke death!!"
210 2018-03-27 22:13:18 Tbh I really should do that shit. And again I have a fuck ton of things going on my head like games, skateboarding, my company, school, stocks, even trying to invest money, but end up losing some on buying stupid shit.
211 2018-03-27 22:13:14 There are many overvalued stocks. $nflx $adbe This can continue for extended periods of time. It doesn’t mean they will drop tomorrow. But @CitronResearch has a following and their tweets usually cause a pullback in the stocks they tweet about.
212 2018-03-27 22:13:00 7/What really scares is that people can’t seem to tune out the noise. But we have to. It’s the only way to hear the Lord. One other thing. Central banks have been buying up stocks, bonds, other assets of multinational corporations.
213 2018-03-27 22:12:18 NOT REPEALING IDIOT!
NO CONSUMER MACHINE GUNS, AUTOMATIC WEAPONS OR BUMP STOCKS!
214 2018-03-27 22:10:58 "Dow drops 345 points as tech stocks get crushed!"

STILL GREAT NEWS????

F#MAGA
215 2018-03-27 22:10:55 Thank god for that. Maybe we can extend that to semiautomatics, bump stocks, and eventually even handguns! Since most crimes are committed with handguns. Anything else you can say I've probably refuted in the last 12 hours, so you can go through my tweets and save me the trouble.
216 2018-03-27 22:10:52 Now, I’m no expert but @DowJones  is starting to look a lot less like a correction and a lot more like a  market or even worse a crash. Should we be worried? #nyse #stocks #Beetroot
217 2018-03-27 22:10:29 Two points: 1. 50% of Americans own no equities so how the market does is immaterial to them. 2. The equity market is non partisan. Stocks follow earnings.  However if 45 wants to take credit for it going up he should take the blame as it goes down. I
218 2018-03-27 22:10:00 DAX Futures have posted a daily trading range of more than 2.0% for 4 days in a row. The run last extended to 5 days on 5 February 2016, 544 trading days ago (when the run lasted for 10 days) #stocks #futures
219 2018-03-27 22:10:00 This market is a little ill. A lot ill, maybe. Smart guys will go on at length to tell you how and why, I am not that smart. But the stocks I own all violated the selling rules I try to follow, so I sold everything today - in the AM when we were up , too. I'll be watching.
220 2018-03-27 22:09:40 I supported the ban on bump-stocks, by the way. They are unneccessary.
221 2018-03-27 22:07:29 Last year International stocks outperformed US stocks by 6.22%. The pervious 4 years US stocks had outperformed International by 7.96%, 4.69%, 15.97%, and 18.05%.
If someone was keeping score the US lost in 2017 after winning (bigly) every year from 2013 – 2016.
222 2018-03-27 22:07:28 Whilst stocks last  #laddinnit
223 2018-03-27 22:06:58 I think the gun lobby is like the tobacco companies back in the day. They fight any study, politician or law that would cost them a sale. Whatever doubts I had about that theory were eliminated that as they fought a ban on bump stocks.
224 2018-03-27 22:06:47 $RH CC: We have one of the most volatile stocks in the industry. It's a reflection of no one believing what we're telling them.
225 2018-03-27 22:06:20 Lot of stocks w th higher highs and higher lows still vs. Friday. With that and being at bottom of range, tomorrow will be telling

228 2018-03-27 22:04:44 This is the traders trying to shake you out of your tech stocks.  Wait a while, you'll get a bargain.  This is the stock market.  THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH REALITY.
229 2018-03-27 22:04:16 the total quotas for 53 fish stock are in 2018 at max biological sustainable level.  The overfished stocks are now slowly recovering

237 2018-03-27 22:00:28 And add no move gun laws or bands of bump stocks either
238 2018-03-27 21:59:19 More Russell 1000 stocks actually hit 52-week highs (18) today than lows (17).
239 2018-03-27 21:58:37 Tuesday's 47 point (-1.8%) drop in S&P Futures was the biggest fall seen on a Tuesday in the 134 weeks since 1 September 2015 #stocks
240 2018-03-27 21:58:36 @SentinAM . WTI haussier à J+2. Jusqu'au (29/03/2018). Les stocks hebdomadaires de pétrole brut au USA sont inférieur aux prévisions. TP = 68$ (Analyse fondamentale)
241 2018-03-27 21:58:21 Same story on so many of my Stocks - they tried to push up but Bears pushed them down again. Looks like more Sogginess to come.
242 2018-03-27 21:58:09 Aren't BUMP STOCKS being reclassified FEDERALLY to fit within the "Machine Gun" prohibitive legislation? Killing 53 and wounding over 500 in less than like 7 minutes through the implementation of BUMP STOCK(s)...90 days) provides no supportive evidence to your presented argument.
243 2018-03-27 21:57:35 Stop saying guns .  We r talking about assult weapons,bump stocks and armor piercing bullets
244 2018-03-27 21:57:02 Good catch! Their stocks did bump after each mass shooting.  *pun intended
245 2018-03-27 21:56:19 Oh well FB stocks will tank
246 2018-03-27 21:56:01 The majority of stocks have been correcting for months now time for the darlings to be shot. Will continue until the diehards say uncle and throw in the towel. The big data stocks need to be shot too as most of it is just crap. Tons of worthless backed up data in the cloud.
247 2018-03-27 21:55:37 Pistol grips and adjustable stocks apparently make a semi auto rifle a "weapon of war" and gets mad when I show him the flaws in his argument, saying "you know what I mean".  Yea bud I know that you need to go shooting for once.
248 2018-03-27 21:55:34 @MadMoneyOnCNBC  Last year and the last months, analyst wanted volatility, we got! So, if the US and Asian markets are spooked about potus and the reps governing, should poor investors keep the brick/mortar and FAANGO stocks as a safety zone. We all eat and use the internet...thx
249 2018-03-27 21:55:22 You’re right as usual. But I like it when he pulls this, ‘cause I get to buy stocks on sale!
250 2018-03-27 21:55:21 I'm not a Trump fan, but I totally disagree with that. IMO the prospect of Hillary winning some a drap on the overall market and big drap on biotech and healthcare stocks. The rest I think is deregulation and overly short-term bullishness
251 2018-03-27 21:55:01 Please tell the market to give a break! It's awful for LITHIUM stocks.
252 2018-03-27 21:54:57 @fonze I nap... again lol I brought some other stocks... my mistake. well glad to see over $1.20+ profit and gain !!!
253 2018-03-27 21:54:26 Preeeeeeetty sure the Constitution one is meant as more as satire. You'd have to be foolish to believe otherwise, but hey- you also apparently think it's really easy to get a gun and that bump stocks make normal guns fully automatic.
254 2018-03-27 21:54:17 logically sound theory but in practice what steps in prevention do you suggest? (and please don't use CPR lessons).. For me, I would ban all semi-automatic weapons, bump stocks and large ammo magazines..
255 2018-03-27 21:54:06 Hello, unfortunately it seems that our previous Social Media herald had you muted. He has since been sent to the stocks and our relationship will henceforth prevail in revelry.
256 2018-03-27 21:52:55 Funnily enough stocks of the ATLS manual are very low so we only have a PDF  I need to feel the heft of the manual to judge how soon to start prep dagnammit
257 2018-03-27 21:52:52 So glad I invested in solid stocks like Facebook and steinhoff instead of that crazy volatile #cryptocurency #icandodgebulletsbaby
258 2018-03-27 21:52:28 With they slow as gone start respecting me before I give anything of them stocks goes up for me like on demand WYA
259 2018-03-27 21:52:23 @SkyNewsRicho Teslar stocks dropped 8.2%. The emperor has no cloths and folks are just starting to wake up to the fact that Musk is a con man. Conned SA out of a few bob and nobody seems to care!
260 2018-03-27 21:52:17 The March activist very clearly listed in their Manifesto want to take rights away from anyone under 21 years of age. They want to ban whatever it is they are calling assault weapons. They want to ban not just bump stocks but anything that alters the firing speed of any weapon.
261 2018-03-27 21:52:17 5mash wishlist:
- blaze is in it
- meowth is in it
- jigglypuff replaced with wigglytuff
- duckhunt is good and fun to play
- defensive play isn't viable and stocks are a bit quicker
- diddy sonic rosa cloud and bayo are publicly executed
- you can play kirby airride city trial
262 2018-03-27 21:52:09  The $FB scandal demonstrates why trading individual stocks is riskier vs. indexing. Too many unseen, unpredictable events waiting to bite single stock investors. #risk
263 2018-03-27 21:51:57 Ok let's ban bump stocks still not passed
Ban all military assault  style weapons 
Univesal Background checks 
Including Mental Health
Anyone who owns a gun must  be registered,  trained on that weapon and certified. With a recertification every couple of yrs.
And hard criminal
264 2018-03-27 21:51:52 @Techcenterr any details from the agm?
265 2018-03-27 21:51:41 I'm not sure either but I indistinctly remember they will go public in 2019 but oh well on serious note, I hope the bts members will own stocks too sjdjd

269 2018-03-27 21:48:30 oh really? I didn't know about that, they'll probably offer stocks without becoming totally publicly traded
270 2018-03-27 21:48:23 I’d turn it around and say why are you so afraid of responsible checks and balances? What’s the harm? You’re not part of a well regulated militia, I’m going to assume. So how does a waiting period or a ban on bump stocks infringe on your rights?
271 2018-03-27 21:48:21 Wish we had them put in stocks for all the people to see, as in the more puritanical times.
272 2018-03-27 21:46:34 @SpeakerRyan We need to have Republicans dissociate themselves from NRA as this is a group working against gun safety issues such as uniform background check with a decent waiting period, eliminate automatic weapons & bump stocks Protect our children or you leave now
273 2018-03-27 21:45:52 I think we will be in a bear market for US Stocks till Feb of 2019. Lucky for me I sold all my positions a month ago.

278 2018-03-27 21:43:14 @TheFiveFNC what DEMs like @SenFeinstein do is propose a bill to ban bump stocks. Okay that makes sense on the surface but then you looking the bill and the verbiage says it bands any modifications that make the gun perform better like improved triggers or better bolts. #TheFive
279 2018-03-27 21:43:02 @TuckerCarlson  If bump stocks and other devices are banned, what stops people from printing them on 3D printers?
280 2018-03-27 21:42:43 I had the game backwards. I shouldn’t be tweeting about stocks. Be a happy consumer. Spend your money on products you worked hard and long for. Buy buy buy!
281 2018-03-27 21:42:36 Stocks down...
Tech markets will be traded for energy.

DOW WILL BOUNCE BACK.
282 2018-03-27 21:42:18 a little dabble in all of them is prob your best way to go ......... some coins are just as over priced as stocks btw :) ...... but lets be real im mostly interested in #5 or i wouldnt even be answering to this
283 2018-03-27 21:42:03 Mini kegs 5 litres, growlers 1 and 2 litres. Most beers should be available on bag in box. Were you after dark or pale? I can check stocks tomorrow and confirm what is available.
284 2018-03-27 21:41:54 The market pullback in the last week is good for 3 things: 1) add to positions or start positions in stocks you’ve “missed out” on 2) potential buy list getting bigger 3) unfollow people on $TWTR you see who’s a pro and who’s a  in this market #investing #trading #TomsTruths
285 2018-03-27 21:40:57 Sarah..do you know how the markets actually work?  They go up..they go down.  The news cycle usually dictates that.  The tech sultans are dumping stocks fast because they are corrupt.  The overall market climate is awesome and that's thanks to tax cuts.
286 2018-03-27 21:40:30 So, Justice Stevens just articulated the real agenda. It’s not AR’s, Mag size or bump stocks. It’s a BAN and they have ALWAYS wanted. BUSTED
287 2018-03-27 21:40:19 Where is the President I voted for?  What about the funding for the wall?  Why are we going after Russia with NO PROOF?  What do bump stocks have to do with violence?  More people die in swimming pools than in mass shootings.  Ban swimming pools!!!!
288 2018-03-27 21:40:09 Better earnings from tax cuts coming in the first quarter, a lower stock market would raise the thrill of a higher denominator in the P/E ratio that means stocks could become cheaper, something like 15 times forward earnings, in a world of low rates. Yes rates are low. Hold Long
289 2018-03-27 21:39:50 thing is this move / correction wasn't really about Tesla, but about over-valued 'story' stocks. how many days in the past has there been bad news (in the real world) and Tesla stock has been up or completely un-moved by it...
290 2018-03-27 21:39:08 $AYTU - another phenomenal day! My trailing stop got hit and I had to take the profits. The market is shaking hard and it’s time to take quick wins.

291 2018-03-27 21:39:02 Ok, it’s by a features editor, so it’s a bit shallow, but she says we would want a Tory who did what JC has done in the stocks. Of course we would, but in such circumstances it wouldn’t make it into the Guardian or the BBC.
292 2018-03-27 21:38:34 He must be busy picking up the pieces from his bitcoin call, he should stick with stocks at least does decent work there
293 2018-03-27 21:38:04 Did you run out of Twitter space?
How about:
Remove the gun show and private sale loophole!
Keep guns out of the hands of those with restraining orders
Ban bump-stocks
Ban Assault Weapons

298 2018-03-27 21:36:43 Always love the commentary of the day: Mid/Late February $TNX headed over 3%, sell stocks $SPX. Today, $TNX breaks below 2.8%, economy must be slowing, sell stocks. During a correction/bear market, everything perceived as being negative. Opposite during uptrends. #perception
299 2018-03-27 21:36:10 Lol. If that pleb's roi were mine I'd probably hide in a corner and cry - even my few stocks (currently up 350% ) put him to shame. Not to speak of crypto. And I really don't know what I'm doing.

It is abused  everywhere in the US.
2 to make a semi automatic  gun fully automatic all you need to do is file down the sear,

334 2018-03-27 21:24:35 Outside reversals in "all" leading stocks on higher volume. To be honest it can't get much more bearish than this. Like I said last week you should watch for a spill over of bearish action in $FB and $GOOGL into  $AMZN $NVDA $MSFT $NFLX $NTNX $GOOGL $WB $APTI $TEAM. DONE!

365 2018-03-27 21:12:51 Exactly!!  Hitler confiscated guns by banning bump stocks, requiring background checks and making sure everyone was a reasonable age in order to buy a gun. At least the SOB didn’t require everyone to turn in their guns like the people are asking for here.

368 2018-03-27 21:11:17 They were semi autos...Amateurs and anti gun zealots speak of them as "Military Assault Rifles"  Bump stocks can be made very easily. Personally I don't care if they ban them..Also they are not called clips, they are magazines. You don't know squat about firearms.
369 2018-03-27 21:11:16 I think we have to wait and see the final draft of TTFI. I might have to file a U.S. return due to investment in U.S. stocks. At the end of the day I would have the option of selling all my U.S. stocks and then be free of filing or continue to file a return for U.S. income.

372 2018-03-27 21:10:24 I keep my stock positions in a Google spreadsheet. As of this morning all my British stocks (e.g. BO) are listed with the wrong price. Anybody have the same issue/solution?

377 2018-03-27 21:08:17 Still waiting for what you would give up, in the spirit of compromise.

I've already thrown bump stocks and “gun show loopholes” into the ring.

What you got?
378 2018-03-27 21:06:34 VT House now debating whether the state should buy bump stocks and high-capacity magazines from gun dealers to clear out inventories when those devices become illegal. Cost unknown. #vtpoli

380 2018-03-27 21:05:27 we need to urge government to make gun laws so our kids stop being mowed down by assault rifles and bump stocks. Bribe $$ NRA
381 2018-03-27 21:05:02 The very day after Trump was elected private prison industry stocks skyrocketed on wall street
382 2018-03-27 21:04:57 Im not trying to start an argument or be the contrarian, but honest question; dont you think its a small leap that these traditional investors who remain highly skeptical about the crypto-sphere are going to dive in head first every time stocks dump?
383 2018-03-27 21:04:55 Market is kicking my ass right now. Trump stops tweeting about stocks and everything crashes.
384 2018-03-27 21:04:52 BS. It was designed as a civilian sporting rifle. It cannot be modified to be fully auto (pull the trigger once and it fires all of the bullets) I agree that bump stocks are a sketchy subject and probably shouldn’t be available with out some questions

390 2018-03-27 21:04:07 Chinese companies raise capital here ,manipulate earnings and dump the stocks, making tons of money from stock buyers. Then they dilist and go back to home country for another round. SEC should look into these. Without ability to charge Chinese CEO, how can you protect investors?
391 2018-03-27 21:03:46 Not at all.  You and your kind are constantly demanding we give up even more of our rights ... at times, like you, even calling for "compromise."

So, let's have some compromise.  I would give up bump stocks and the infamous "gun show loophole."

Now, what would you give up?

415 2018-03-27 20:58:30 ETFs do all the damage. Everyone's chart is the same. Good stocks go down because ETFs they are in go down. It's something that shouldn't happen, but will continue to until ETFs are put under control.

417 2018-03-27 20:56:52 Stocks bullrun was the only thing I miss. I like when people lose faith in crypto tho. More for me at a discount. Not enough wealth to go around for all.

419 2018-03-27 20:55:47 Let the state Attorney General's Office be distracted by this nonsense but do their jobs.

I love guns, I don't want anyones guns taken away and I think outlawing bump stocks was bullshit, they only needed to make it harder to aquire

451 2018-03-27 20:45:41 Yesterday you're all excited about a 1 day jump in the markets like it's evidence of a winning strategy by you. Today it's back down.

462 2018-03-27 20:43:51 Your side repeatedly calls for incremental steps as a precursor to full blown confiscation, most recently at that side show of a march last weekend.

"Give us an inch ... on bump stocks ... and we'll take a mile" I believe it was.
463 2018-03-27 20:43:41 @Richzeoli Don’t you think Trump directed Sessions to make this ban on bump stocks and this was an attorney coming up with the best argument possible? So I blame trump not Sessions.
464 2018-03-27 20:43:14 Maybe this is the time , banks stocks should outperform despite so many bad news of NPA and frauds
465 2018-03-27 20:43:11 Bless Mom & Pop but loading stocks at ATH by stock re-purchasing programs is the passion of all CEOs. Has ever been so - will ever be so.
466 2018-03-27 20:43:03 Yeah I think that's basically it, few dominant MUs so every bracket match is at least a bit stressful for you, and difficulty taking them stocks in a game where you can easily die off one or two hit confirms

469 2018-03-27 20:41:37 Never mind! Yesterday’s explosion was an aberration. Tech stocks - see Facebook and Microsoft - led each major index into a ditch. If the Dow and S&P don’t rally in the next two days, they will have nine quarter winning streaks broken.  Nasdaq a bit less precarious.

476 2018-03-27 20:37:51 It's more like if you didn't see what tax reform would do, or if you missed the fact that stocks and bonds are moving together, it's time to cut your losses (or if you prefer take what's left of your gains) when there is any kind of relief rally.
477 2018-03-27 20:36:43 $SPX n markets.  Things looking n feeling heavy.  But they have for a while.  Difference is that we are at higher prices  n we are seeing some heavy selling on some stocks.  Remember the stocks that have been leading this heavy cargo train will b the first ones to signal the sell
478 2018-03-27 20:36:33 Yeah...you're winning bigly!
The Dow drops about 345 points, completely reversing a 244-point gain from early in the day, as tech stocks get crushed. The selloff followed Monday's 670-point spike.

490 2018-03-27 20:32:57 I dunno. Think I am quite different than what you like to call a "gun grabber." Have all the guns you want, we are just going to end the sales of this type, with these 4-5 qualities, and ban bump stocks.

493 2018-03-27 20:31:54 Bump stocks were deemed legal during the Obama adm. Since then VERY few persons have been killed by weapons using this technique (Las Vegas shooting only case of note). It's like the "Assault Weapons Ban" in 90's. Feels good but did NOTHING to decrease gun violence
494 2018-03-27 20:31:42 You are misinformed
 He is rapidly decreasing it by lowering the trade deficit. Companies coming back. Selling energy instead of buying it leaving Paris accord etc. Economy is the best it's been in 30 yrs. Record high stocks too
495 2018-03-27 20:30:58 Tough environmental to trade. No trend. The move on some of the tech glamour stocks are extreme on both sides.
496 2018-03-27 20:30:57 Ahh, some chance stocks will probably go up or down then too?

511 2018-03-27 20:27:00 If you did enact a ban for the long term which restricted manufacturing and sales of certain weapons and capabilties such as high capacity magazines and now recently bump stocks, it will obviously reduce the probablity of mass shootings occurring.

541 2018-03-27 20:13:30 @realDonaldTrump You lie AGAIN. The Obama administration didn't legalize bump stocks. Obama issued EOs imposing stricter controls. You rolled them back. He could not restrict non mechanical bump stocks without new laws by Congress. They refused.

546 2018-03-27 20:12:20 World stocks ex-US rally: Europe +1.2%; US -1.7%. US investors joy lasted 1 day as US stocks returned 2/3 of yesterday's gains.

561 2018-03-27 20:10:29 Optimistic tweets and talk in past? Not much if anything. North Korea? Bump stocks? It's like 95% Fox News retweets anyway.

570 2018-03-27 20:08:47 Senator, you’re right. Banning bump stocks and improving background checks are good steps that are tiny only in comparison to the larger steps we need to do to save more lives.

The broker's hymn sheet -- "stocks are finally under their 200-day, get 'em while there hot -- has pretty much blown up in everyone's face.

It pays to watch the bond market ...
636 2018-03-27 19:52:31 Can someone staple @realDonaldTrump’s mouth shut so my stocks will chill the fuck out?  What a piece of shit. Worst president of all time.
637 2018-03-27 19:52:30 A lot of scared investors dumping stocks right now.
638 2018-03-27 19:52:21 So gun manufacturers, the NRA, gun lobbyist, gun dealers, etc, are all highly resistant to any gun laws that would affect their bottom line. I think their resistance to raising the gun ownership age or making bump stocks illegal has shown that. Those laws are no brainers
639 2018-03-27 19:52:01 #stocks  stock indexes are collapsing as investors don't bother with individual stocks any more. When folks sell they're taking the entire index down with them. Today is another vote of NO CONFIDENCE in the Donald too.
640 2018-03-27 19:51:31 Precise timing and path down uncertain but little doubt stocks headed much lower.
641 2018-03-27 19:51:30 im sorry for being rude.... Markets are tough. In the end if you HOLD u will get your money back, at least with xrp.  I lost a thousand my first time with stocks years ago buying just because the price was going up, not realizing after a massive run comes a massive correction.

649 2018-03-27 19:49:45 You should do a segment on stocks that aren't owned by any ETFs. Those would be amazing stocks to own.
650 2018-03-27 19:49:36 (1/2) These guests on @CNBC are failing to connect the dots. What's happening to tech stocks today is NOT just a tech story. Too much easy money over the past several years has inflated bubbles all over the place.

667 2018-03-27 19:46:26 Doesn't this typically hinge on how far away from retirement you are?  Dollar cost averaging and all?

As history tends to repeat itself, however, probably smart to pull money out of stocks when Republicans are in control then buy it all back just before Dems regain power.

But, also, I don’t know that I go in for the whole “sins of the father” stuff.
714 2018-03-27 19:38:18 The big issue with tech stocks is many of the owners don't understand what the companies actually do.

742 2018-03-27 19:32:37 Shiller’s Cyclically Adjusted Price-to-Earnings (CAPE) ratio, which looks at the price of the S&P and compares it to average earnings over the past ten years, is at 31.8. The all-time high is 44.19, reached in Dec 1999. Stocks are still expensive by historical standards. Very.
743 2018-03-27 19:32:15 I don’t think they’re saying to take all guns and 2A rights.  Not hearing that.  They are calling for common sense gun control laws and a ban on military style assault rifles, high capacity magazines and bump stocks.  I guess it’s easier to rally support when you ignore this!

756 2018-03-27 19:29:55 no one wants to take guns away, just weapons of war that are being use to slaughter people, Its all about gun safety and reasonable gun reform. No on needs bump stocks or automatic weapons. No reason anyone under 21 should buy a gun, Universal background check is a good idea
757 2018-03-27 19:29:48 "Assault weapons" ban will have no impact on crime, DOJ reports. A reclassification of "Bump Stocks" as a Class 3 accessory (NFA item, requiring a $200 tax and approval to purchase) is a necessary compromise as long as suppressors are down-graded to the same regulation as AOWs.
758 2018-03-27 19:29:47 Banning bump stocks will not save lives. That is a lie and why I beg the .@TexasGOP to find someone who is an actual conservative to give us conservatives a choice other than a RINO. Another reason to be rid of you is Daylight saving time.

772 2018-03-27 19:25:40 2/The Central Banks have been things they’re not supposed to do since 2008. They’ve been buying up stocks, bonds and assets of multinational corporations. That would explain the reason for the near-interest rate during the Obama Administration.

776 2018-03-27 19:23:59 In an environment where speculative, cash-burning names such as #Neflix $NFLX and #Tesla $TSLA are selling off aggressively--stocks that active 'value' managers like to stay far away from--it opens up an environment where active can outperform. Peak indexing?

Hopefully we consolidate tomorrow to bring volatility back
799 2018-03-27 19:18:27 John what have you done, or what are you currently doing to ban bump stocks?  And what are you currently doing to end the gun show loophole where any felon can buy an AR-15 or any other gun undetected?

887 2018-03-27 18:55:49 I'm not barking at all.  I just think that it's more relevant to note that we are near the lows of a 10% selloff a month after it happened versus the daily action of dumb money propping some stocks while others crater. 

Simple disagreement of context

906 2018-03-27 18:48:45 I'm all for common sense restrictions and safe guards. Trump & I both support banning bump stocks and not selling guns to people with mental health problems, however, the Left wants to REPEAL the 2nd Amendment & BAN ALL GUNS. That will NEVER happen.
907 2018-03-27 18:48:31 Majority of stocks are lower today than they were when the market was down 700 pts $DIA $SPY $APPL $FB $TWTR
908 2018-03-27 18:46:57 @fyers1 if Fyers is a free investment zone. Does that mean it does not make any money from traders buying and selling stocks (excluding margin or derivative trading )
909 2018-03-27 18:46:50 stock market has price controls and companies have real world assets that can be sold off if a company goes to bankruptcy. crypto has no protections. it’s not quite the same as stocks.
910 2018-03-27 18:46:45 A man in Saudi Arabia has installed a fridge on the street and stocks it with free food for the homeless people in his neighborhood.
911 2018-03-27 18:46:34 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to cure your depression
912 2018-03-27 18:46:11 They are not the only one, other firms like toyota also stopped but no reason to sell the #stocks in my opinion.
913 2018-03-27 18:46:08 Something maybe with stocks where I can triple my money
914 2018-03-27 18:45:25 Anyone could target social media stocks right now because of Facebook and say look I told you so it’s going down. Man analysts are always late to the party when they come out with info. Remember that. If they come out with information it’s usually after the fact
915 2018-03-27 18:44:51 Whatever. Point is, the people want common sense #GunReformNow. The majority of Americans want background checks w/o loopholes, assault weapons banned, bump stocks banned, and high capacity mags banned. And we won't stop fighting rampant gun violence until we get what we want.
916 2018-03-27 18:43:53 @Rottieluvr Wasn't really my point. Stocks can continue higher being overbought.  Just the same stocks can continue lower oversold. $STUDY

920 2018-03-27 18:39:10 Why is Trump helping them? Trump is making it easy for them, because he has pushed for it. He has said ban bump stocks, ban AR-15's, raise the age people can own certain guns, and he says take the guns and due process second.
921 2018-03-27 18:38:53 @cwfobx big dogs don't play penny stocks
922 2018-03-27 18:38:26 But Trump is making it easy for them, because he has pushed for it. He has said ban bump stocks, ban AR-15's, raise the age people can own certain guns, and he says take the guns and due process second. Trump can't be trusted.

930 2018-03-27 18:36:14 The bulls are merely rotating to other stocks because for a decade it has worked.  Rotating to cash is not even in many people's playbook. 

This feels like a market that wants another 10% losses.  It doesn't have data to rest on lately.
931 2018-03-27 18:36:04 Thanks, I'll look at that, I can remember a few springs where after Q1 it was a slow grind higher, this feels like paper is getting out of some shorts in ED but who knows.  Also stocks looking this bad is clearly putting some money to work in risk off/long UST
932 2018-03-27 18:36:04 $FB They should just jail all Facebook workers who have been stealing and selling user data. Logging all user phone calls? Really? #stocks

934 2018-03-27 18:34:41 The Trump Administration is setting the stage for a furious legal battle over bump stocks by proposing a rule to effectively ban the devices, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire more rapidly. 
AT LEAST START. I DON'T RECALL WHAT THE LAST ADMINISTRATION DID OH YEAH, NOTHING

936 2018-03-27 18:34:07 #stocks#StockMarketCrash  Trump's bear market has two salient features, the failure to reach NEW highs and the failure to return to the its all time high of early Feb.

945 2018-03-27 18:31:53 While I have no love for silly bump stocks, the amount of fun control being enacted in this panic is ridiculous. It would be nice to see more support for the 2nd amendment from the President. While I have faith in you, a lot off gun owners are losing theirs. Don't forget us!

954 2018-03-27 18:29:56 Banning bump stocks or ar-15s for that matter , will do nothing to make anybody safer. Banning all guns will make America a great hunting ground for human predators. Steve guns are good.

971 2018-03-27 18:23:11 Bump stocks are just as accurate as using a belt loop. They’re a novelty.
972 2018-03-27 18:23:11 I’m not in favor of people adding bump stocks to turn a weapon into a fully automatic simulator either. I am in favor of the very minimal amount of regulation required to prevent idiots and criminals from having guns, and no more.
973 2018-03-27 18:23:05 Yeah the kind of clickbait headline. I bought the 2 stocks;-)

985 2018-03-27 18:16:41 I agree, it won't be repealed but if lawmakers took small steps like banning bump stocks or restricting mag size then that would help curb the violence at least.
I disagree, he's not an "old fool", but he knows his law and made some interesting arguments.
986 2018-03-27 18:16:33 AK15 and other military style weapons are not illegal nationally. Maybe in a few states. That’s why the kids want Congress to ban them. Trump says he will ban bump stocks which convert arms to auto weapons.
987 2018-03-27 18:16:29 We the 99% pay sales tax for EVERY PURCHASE (Tires,clothes,medicine) Even E-trade has a fee(tax) while Wall St pays 0% tax on the 5000 TRILLION $$ worth of turnover on Wall St (& the CME) trading stocks,bonds & DERIVATIVES.

994 2018-03-27 18:14:27 One of the reasons we asked to be delisted from stocks is because they are very unreliable. They announced to have some technical difficulties so wait until they have fixed there problem and you should be able to withdraw your SHIELD. You have until 25 April!
995 2018-03-27 18:13:59 I agree that’s why am in no way saying guns should be banned and that’s why even the idea of banning bump stocks or automatic rifles is tough question for me because it does take away someone’s personal freedom’s but we have to do something
996 2018-03-27 18:13:38 They've already passed this absurdity in California.  It's set to take effect in 2019, and the state currently has no idea how to implement it.  

It's not really aimed at criminals. Law-abiding target shooters need large stocks of ammunition.  Criminals don't.

1034 2018-03-27 18:01:34 The investor base of Tesla is quite different from that of other stocks. This makes the stock far more resilient and unpredictable. On the other hand Tesla finally hit 2.5K week model 3 production. I wouldnt go short although stock is clearly overvalued.

1040 2018-03-27 17:59:01 More people are becoming aware of that. And if you look at the stocks of places like McDonald’s you’ll see that people really aren’t in to fast food anymore and millenials want places that are fast, healthy, and make food infront of you. Like PitaPit, Subway....

1046 2018-03-27 17:57:34 It’s really funny that Obama’s meets with business execs and it’s a plot, but Trump meets with business execs, it’s being president, including Carl Icahn (who miraculously sold millions in steel stocks just before the tariff announcement)
Hmmmmm
1047 2018-03-27 17:57:25 Any thoughts on assistance Israel might have generated to the Trump campaign? Any thoughts on Israel’s large purchases of U.S. stocks possibly to prop up the market?
1048 2018-03-27 17:57:18 Bump stocks are already in the process of becoming illegal. “Better background checks” would be great, if you could explain exactly what that would entail. The problem is is the vague language in regards to regulation. Let’s talk specifics

1052 2018-03-27 17:54:47 Well the stocks wont have their run like they did before sadly. May be a bump here and thete but no 50 to 1000 per ent returns
1053 2018-03-27 17:54:27 I agree that we need tougher gun laws but think the restriction should be on the magazine capacity, not features like pistol grips or collapsible stocks.  Limit mags to 10 rounds instead of banning guns with "military features".
1054 2018-03-27 17:53:34 @bravisatemple Hi Mr.Ramesh, I would like to know the total charges (brokerage + regulatory + others) incurred when we trade intraday in US stock exchanges via Tradestation? Ex. If I buy stocks worth $10,000 & sell stocks worth $10,000, will aggregate charges be less than $10?
1055 2018-03-27 17:53:31 Their stocks have gone down already..
1056 2018-03-27 17:52:54 Saying you back something doesn’t mean you do when it comes to a lobbyist. Why are there still bump stocks six months after Las Vegas? Did the NRA go and demand their A+ bought politicians to support banning bump stocks?
1057 2018-03-27 17:51:23 But people are talking about regulations weather banning bump stocks better background checks people are talking its just they’re being drowned out by no that’s our natural rights don’t take them away and let’s just ban all guns

1063 2018-03-27 17:48:58 Not smart to ban bump stocks... change the culture of violence in this country if you want to stop mass shootings.
1064 2018-03-27 17:48:06 #Stocks | #Tesla - $TSLA : cc. @Citi , cc. @rwbaird 

Tesla may be struggling to convert car shoppers into Model 3 buyers.

The company might not achieve its weekly production goal by the end of March.
1065 2018-03-27 17:47:34 Sooooo they should be criticized because they took the time to learn how to trade stocks and invest their money while many minimum wage earners chose to work at Burger King and buy spinning rims or hunting rifles with their money? Really?
1066 2018-03-27 17:47:29 What exactly do you mean by assault style weapons? Bump stocks, well okay, but you can make your own in no time. High cap magazines? Tell me what good that would do. Background checks have been the norm for years. I agree we need more attention on mental health.

1073 2018-03-27 17:44:09 Like you! NRA refused to let Bump Stocks be banned. Laws have to change to match the weapons and accessories. Machine guns are tightly regulated. Nothing says we can not do the same thing for other military weapons or weapon accessories.  NRA owns Goverment. Time for change

1076 2018-03-27 17:43:03 The problem with this is that Tory and UKIP politicians regularly do more than half of what Corbyn has done, and I have yet to see these stocks spoken of. Just promotions for Tories and further airtime or column inches for UKIP’ers.

1080 2018-03-27 17:41:56 2017 was the ninth year of Obama's economy; Trump couldn't get his program passed until late December. Growth is good, jobs are good, stocks are up. Presidents Romney, McCain, Gore or Clinton would be 60%+. Trump has only GOP sycophants; he's paying the price for his scumbaggery.
1081 2018-03-27 17:41:54 When you mention the ruger 10/22 is it mainly due to the kick? My biggest issue is the length of the gun and the ability to hold it easily -- the adjustable stocks make overwise unwieldy guns manageable.

1083 2018-03-27 17:41:35 Today on the Judiciary calendar, we have bills to reduce the lifetime handgun permit fee and exempt folks from certain training requirements to obtain handgun permits.

1084 2018-03-27 17:41:28 I think an added amendment to it would be a great idea!Permanently prohibiting the public from owning those semi automatic type firearms,  & bump stocks & of course full automatics.Also any other kind ic military grade weapons that could,  if in wrong hands,kill innocent people.

1090 2018-03-27 17:38:37 No shit sherlock. The point is that it’s going back up. Idk why people cry every time the stocks go down for a day. This shit happens all the time.
1091 2018-03-27 17:37:51 If Donald Trump was taking the NRA's money he wouldn't want to raise the age to 21 or ban bump stocks.
1092 2018-03-27 17:37:03 Oh shriek! Surprised they didn’t put in stocks and pillory you. How could you offend so? Have you no shame? By the way - do you get to appeal the twitter ruling?
1093 2018-03-27 17:36:58 IMHO, Buffet wants to buy companies, NOT stocks at this point. $BRKA But if he were to buy any beaten down name, it would likely be $CMCSA not $GE. Better to buy the better balance sheet and the one who took $GE to school. Plus oppty to loan them $ on a bigger $FOXA deal..
1094 2018-03-27 17:36:19 I would cover here unless you are prepared to hunker down for the long term. It takes a long time for big company stocks to fall below $10.  On the other hand, you can short OTM calls at will and not have to worry about being exercised - it's free premium collection.
1095 2018-03-27 17:36:07 Assault weapons include semiautomatic firearms with a large magazine of ammunition that were designed and configured for rapid fire and combat use, and or accessories which can be added to a gun to easily achieve this same goal (bump stocks)
1096 2018-03-27 17:35:46 I agree it’s going to mostly about school policies, but there should be change with gun policies as well. Like banning bump stocks, no one needs one. FYI don’t think I didn’t notice you not commenting on my comment 
1097 2018-03-27 17:34:37 anti-gun movement won’t be satisfied unless they have all the guns. First they wanted to bump stocks and NRA sold us out on the bump stocks. And they are not satisfied until they have all the guns. It’s called incrementalism. Slowly boil the frog  #2A

1106 2018-03-27 17:31:00 Stocks down big last week due to fear of trade wars, up Monday on supposed easing of trade war fears, all the while, neatly kissing the 200 moving avg.  Ever think there’s a puppet master behind this stuff?
1107 2018-03-27 17:31:00 It has already started. “Bump Stocks” are [or are becoming] illegal, except they aren’t. The legal terminology is “device.”  ATF will use that word “device” to mean what they want it to be. The gun grab will start quietly. It is easier to accomplish this way.
1108 2018-03-27 17:30:28 Big chinese leader $WB finding resistance at the 50d today. I actually see many bearish signal in big stocks and former leaders right now. It is easy to ignore them as the QE-market conditioned us to buy the dips. However QE is coming to an end so be alert.
1109 2018-03-27 17:30:21 You do realize the omnibus will fund the Wall per military funds. Also, he can still refund the pp because the omnibus is more like suggestions. About the 2nd, he did away with bump stocks, that does not equal attack. It's only been a year and a half so give him a min.
1110 2018-03-27 17:30:02 The Federal Reserve raised rates last week, however contrary to expectations, bond price have rallied as their yields have fallen well below February highs due to stocks tumbling.

1113 2018-03-27 17:29:15 …& what should we feed them on? No answer at all, if we continue to rape the less charismatic global fish stocks to produce farmed fish, while feeling good about not killing seals.
Maybe a better answer to stop farming salmon altogether and work to restore our wild fish stocks?
1114 2018-03-27 17:28:13 3. None of the AR owners I know has bump stocks. I think they’re stupid, cause woeful inaccuracy, and am surprised that the ATF signed off on it. I own no AR type rifles personally, but have shot one chambers with .22 and it was fun, but I’m still meh about it.
1115 2018-03-27 17:28:05 It's not entirely true that 2A doesn't have any restrictions. In fact, many of the restrictions (no machine guns, criminal background checks before firearms purchases) just have too many loopholes (assault rifles with bump stocks, private firearms sales). That's the thing to fix.

1127 2018-03-27 17:24:09 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President someone is giving you bad advice on guns. A #BumpStock ban is a bad idea because it give #Gungrabbers a foot in the door & accomplishes nothing. Bump stocks are a novelty,  a curiosity with no practical value & have never been used in a crime.
1128 2018-03-27 17:24:07 Oh most have,Every discussion I've  had with the other side turns into outright ban.I will concede to raising the age to 21 and ban bump stocks,They will concede to nothing but full on repeal.They give no quarter so none shall be given.
1129 2018-03-27 17:24:04 Ban assault style weapons, bump stocks, high capacity magazines/clips get more mental health centers. Universal background checks and waiting period for gun purchases.  4% of the gun violence are mass shootings, which make news- but look at DV issues. Stop war on weed. Ideas?

1141 2018-03-27 17:19:29 Apparently your reading comprehension needs some work. She said, “We will take the big and we will take the small, but we will keep fighting. When they give us that inch, that bump stock ban, we will take a mile.” That says that after bump stocks they will want more.

1145 2018-03-27 17:18:18 I will have to take your word for that, I was 5.
Hypothetically let us say the country, to keep the peace bans bump stocks and AR / AK. They will not be happy because it does not address the root problem. Have to take another "inch" the next inch will fix the problem.

1147 2018-03-27 17:18:05 Well, the usual combination of stocks/bonds might not work today. Bonds haven't been a good hedge for past few dips. Feb 5th and last week taught people that they're over-exposed to risk, I think

1149 2018-03-27 17:17:27 Irrespective of Stevens stated position there could be some good come out of it
I'm thinking this just might get these posers to drop the facade and start saying what they really want instead of ban bump stocks ammunition certain magazines

This just might focus the debate.....

1153 2018-03-27 17:15:02 Nasdaq spoiler alert:The Nasdaq led on the way up, is it now in trouble? The Mar ’00 curve is a balancing curve that shows an obj of 6500/7400 (reached, high 7186). Also of note, the obj of the Mar ’09 curve is 6900/7400 (reached as well). Is that it for equities? #stocks #nasdaq
1154 2018-03-27 17:13:56 Agree. If Left starts in the middle talking about stricter regulations, you end up with meaningless ban on bump stocks. Start the debate with repealing 2nd Amendment and you might end up with sensible regulation.

Almost any repeating firearm can be shot quickly enough yet more accurately to make up for the loss in rate of fire—all of the accuracy problems of automatic fire are magnified by bump fire.

1187 2018-03-27 17:00:21 Again, bump stocks have nothing to do with the amendments. No where does it mention anything about weapon attachments in the Second Amendment.
1188 2018-03-27 17:00:18 imo,it comes down to volatility.  when vol spikes, you tend to have big % moves up or down.  look at Oct08, 2 of biggest % gains ever in month S&P lost 16%.  stocks were in downtrend.  @mebfaber has/had data on assets when trading below 10mosSMA. asset sees 45%+ increase in vol.
1189 2018-03-27 17:00:00 You realize a belt loop can act just like a bump stock, so banning bump stocks is useless

1205 2018-03-27 16:52:14 2. Cali isn't the entire country. Your argument on mag capacity is a weak one. 
3. As far as "most AR owners" not already possessing bump stocks; it's beside the point. An accessory that converts a semiautomatic into an automatic rate of fire. Nitrus is outlawed for a reason.
1206 2018-03-27 16:52:11 What fundamental info do you need? 
Background data updating supply & demand (quarterly stocks, WESS)? 
Or wags on what acreage (prospective plantings, etc.), yield, demand might be? 
I choose the former. 
The latter is ridiculous. 
Oh, and there is also basis and spreads.

1217 2018-03-27 16:48:21 I dunno man you’ve said you want mass shooters to have high capacity magazines and now you’re saying bump stocks save lives. Paddock fired over a thousand times in ten minutes, killed 60 people and injured over 800. Without a bump stock he couldn’t have fired that many times
1218 2018-03-27 16:48:02 I know that feeling  ;-) I tend to find that with a mix of decent Stocks over time the Good News outweighs the Bad and the Portfolio does OK.  #SDRY looks a bargain at these levels.
1219 2018-03-27 16:47:55 What do you see that is not getting done.  The NRA offered solutions.  As an example; They support the banning of butt stocks. They want ALL states to utilize the national data bank for background checks. Not all do from what I understand
1220 2018-03-27 16:47:54 Almost every one of the speeches called for gun ban, are you completely stupid or just lying? Even that air headed blonde said "give us an inch (bump stocks) and we will take a mile! (complete gun ban). You can't make up lies...because the rest of us are smarter than you.

1244 2018-03-27 16:39:15 False. There are several AR15’s designed to be compact enough to fit in a regular sized book bag. Law-folding stocks, AR-Pistols, etc... all fit nicely in compact spaces.
1245 2018-03-27 16:38:48 Thiel is neck deep in this data mess. His ties to the Trump campaign and administration, sits on the board at FB, sold FB stocks recently just before the CA news dropped, has his own data agency with multiple gov contracts and is just an all around horrible human being.

1254 2018-03-27 16:38:13 Also worth noting that by reducing the controlability of his weapons & cutting short the duration of his shooting (by setting off the smoke alarm, alerting police to his location), those bump stocks probably *saved lives.*

1260 2018-03-27 16:36:35 Its all in the wording right.  There is no such device that turns any gun into an illegal machine gun.  Bump stocks make a legal gun mimic an automatic but its still not an machine gun.  Your jaws must be sore from blowing Putin and the NRA.
1261 2018-03-27 16:35:54 but allowing corporate offshore holdings to come back at a steep discount is going to provide some more juice for equities through buyback schemes, it's crazy that the Dow has been driven up mainly by the performance of 10 stocks, it's insanely unbalanced

I’m not afraid of it, nor do I think it’s feasible. But it’s the end goal that many want.

1270 2018-03-27 16:33:09 Tech stocks taking a bath over the last 40 minutes, complete nose-dive.
1271 2018-03-27 16:33:07 Let us know when your party stops bitching about age limits, mental health, bump stocks, assault rifles and background checks. Now you wet the bed because a few people say they want 2A repealed?  It won’t happen but keep deflecting if you must.
1272 2018-03-27 16:32:40 LAS VEGAS.     23 LEGALLY purchased AR15s/guns, bump stocks, high cap mags. All background checks passed. No mental illness history/no red flags. 10 Minutes. 58 dead, 851 wounded. (One of the wounded is now a paraplegic and her best friend is among the dead).
1273 2018-03-27 16:32:36 $SPY making narrow range day today, hesitating at price resistance at 265. $QQQ rejected by 50-day SMA and now heading lower. Again, please remain cautious entering new long positions. Small share size, firm stops. #stocks

1276 2018-03-27 16:30:05 No trading fees? I need to make at least 42 bucks on Ameritrade before selling my stocks just to make up for the fees. Doesn’t help that I’m also 25 bucks in the red haha
1277 2018-03-27 16:29:37 Very possible we see a market crash (more like recession) leading up to, and directly after the Tech CEOs testify on 4/10. Tech stocks will go into free fall. They all know that their very business model could be non existent by the time this is all over.

1280 2018-03-27 16:28:10 Right - but he was able to legally spend that money and stockpile those guns and that ammo and use bump stocks. 

Up until he shot up that concert he was a “sensible gun owner” and then when he snapped he had all this legally obtained firepower at his disposal

1284 2018-03-27 16:27:05 Thats just the loudest/most extreme voices. Think of it more like getting a drivers license: mandatory classes/field experience/permit/license, registering the gun, and then reregistering every year or two, mandatory background checks, no bump stocks or silencers, etc.
1285 2018-03-27 16:26:01 Gonna hit $DEEL and add some here.  Anyone else in with me? I should be able to wipe out the 60k or so showing in the 018's

1293 2018-03-27 16:23:37 Good question. I'm not familiar enough with their practices to know the answer, but it does seem crazy that they are able to move the markets on large cap stocks this much. Even Warren Buffett's comments often don't move large caps.
1294 2018-03-27 16:23:24 .@CitronResearch have you done any diligence on the Toronto Cannabis stocks? $WEED trades for 98X Revenues at a $6.8BN valuation which is fucking absurd. One analyst is calling for $8BN valuation based on his 2020 EBITDA forecast at 92x......

Classify semi-auto rifles like auto rifles with same tracking and permitting, and raise age limit to 21+

Done.

1308 2018-03-27 16:19:45 This movement is not aiming to ban all guns. It is aiming to make them more difficult to attain for people who should not have them. The only things this movement is aiming at banning are bump stocks and other unnecessary items that simply aim to kill.

1321 2018-03-27 16:13:26 I also think they would, but there are many loopholes from what i understood! 1st i think u guys should find a way to enforce the existing laws and then add a few more laws (like the banning bump stocks for example). Maybe everything at the same its not the brightest idea

1344 2018-03-27 16:05:07 Oh please. How about military style assault weapons then? We both know about the ballistic characteristics of those rounds, whether M-4, M-16, AR-15 and the damage they do.  I of course know about fully automatic unless you include bump stocks.

1354 2018-03-27 16:01:15 The ar15 is not military grade. I understand no fully automatic weapons. And those are already banned. But the ar15 and rifles like it. Are not fully automatic. They are semi automatic. Which if you don't know what that means, I'm surprised. As for bump stocks? I don't care.

1358 2018-03-27 16:00:45 I believe in 2nd Amendment rights. I believe most of our population does. The danger is military weapons (i.e. semi automatic, fully automatic, bump stocks, etc) in lay people's homes. They should be restricted to war zones and military bases.

1395 2018-03-27 15:51:24 No, Obama didn't legalize bump stocks.  In fact, he issued EOs to regulate more which YOU rolled back, and couldn't legally ban bump stocks without Congress passing a law.  THEY REFUSED.  Stop lying with every breath you take.
1396 2018-03-27 15:51:07 The Constitution says the right to bear arms. It doesn’t say bump stocks. I won’t feel bad for you at all when these are gone.
1397 2018-03-27 15:50:10 It’s already difficult to purchase guns. It’s not an easy process. A 10 round magazine reloads as fast as a 30 round magazine. Bump stocks may increase the fire rate, but it makes the weapon vastly less accurate.

Listen out to Joseph tomorrow morning to find out where he'll be in Lincolnshire & Newark. Find him and say the secret phrase and you'll get an egg (while stocks last)!

1400 2018-03-27 15:49:49 I am not sure I understand the alleged folly of the argument. A semiautomatic weapon cannot become fully automatic by any means available in the common market. A quick trigger finger, large capacity magazines or even so called bump stocks do not change that.
1401 2018-03-27 15:48:48 On mag capacity. I live in Cali where we can’t have anything larger than a 10 round magazine anyways. 3. Bump stocks are a different issue altogether since most AR owners don’t have them. Look up Jerry Miculek.

1403 2018-03-27 15:48:21 I'm a strong supporter of 2A but see no logical purpose for using bump stocks.

1405 2018-03-27 15:47:43 Yep even on decent news stocks go down. Everyone is a pussy selling every chance they get. Lol.
1406 2018-03-27 15:47:03 Exactly,

Ban:
Assault weapons

1411 2018-03-27 15:45:48 Power was given to the NRA by their positive support. But NRA went too far by going to the mattresses for outliers like high-volume assault rifles, bump stocks & silencers, which don’t belong in the main flow of society. AND REPEAT: Nobody said take all your guns away!!
1412 2018-03-27 15:45:26 Bayo vs ZSS early rage stocks?
1413 2018-03-27 15:45:21 The way I see it, the $ we put in there can sit while we trade other stocks. It was enough to look away from. I'd let 'er sit just in case, she may get more publicity, imo. I  DO completely see where you're coming from, am that way with another stock I own. Best of luck to us! 
1414 2018-03-27 15:45:12 (1/2) When I talk about the companies I invest in, you'll be able to rattle off hundreds of bad things about them-but that's why they're cheap! The most common comment I get is "Don't you read the paper?! Because if you read the paper, there's no way you'd buy these stocks."
1415 2018-03-27 15:43:56 "If you give us an inch and ban bump stocks we will take a mile," one girl said on stage.

1418 2018-03-27 15:41:55 There was a report about a week ago, that Denver banned bump stocks on Jan 22 and was expecting them to be turned in/surrendered. At the time of the report, zero bump stocks had been turned in.

1421 2018-03-27 15:40:35 You people are pathetic cowards.  No one wants to take your guns and hunting rifles away.  We want UNIVERSAL GUN LAWS, UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS, banning military weapons, bump stocks, large magazines for private ownership.  If you want to go to a range and shoot these, fine.
1422 2018-03-27 15:40:33 The #FreeTrade Lie is that TRADE somehow INCREASES Economic Growth in BOTH Economies ... that is intellectually impossible (which means that #Globalist are PURE Liars = They get rich while our #MiddleClass is decimated = average wages SAME "value" now as 1980 but stocks up 2500%
1423 2018-03-27 15:40:31 A quote overheard at work today.

"Yea I went out and bought two bump stocks before they ban them. I can't put them on my AR though because it's already full auto and I'm not allowed to modify it, and I'm NOT gonna put one on my kid's AR."

"Yea, that'd be pretty crazy."
1424 2018-03-27 15:40:14 You’ve been brainwashed to an alarming degree. No one is saying take away ALL guns. Although, it would be a safer society. Just common sense gun laws like banning military style weapons, extended mags, bump stocks. You could still own hunting shotguns and muzzle loaders.

1428 2018-03-27 15:37:48 It is real and should NOT be done.

Ban assault weapons, ban bump stocks, maybe handguns.
You should not ban hunting rifles.

but the point is they're claiming all "liberals" want that.
1429 2018-03-27 15:37:30 $FB hit the 5ema on the way up today then fell off. Which is what stocks do when they're trending. Usually you like to see it on the other side. But we can't always get what we want now can we?

1433 2018-03-27 15:36:24 ISU estimated China's E10 mandate would result in significant corn imports starting 19/20 assuming they maintained min. stocks of 1.39 bil. bu.

1439 2018-03-27 15:33:33 #DAX at 11.957. On 23. March went below the important 12.000 point mark. In February 2018 below 13.000 points.
I expect the trend down to continue: If 11.700, we may also see 11.500.

1504 2018-03-27 15:12:06 That's possible, but stricter regulations, banning assault weapons, mega capacity magazines, and bump stocks is a good start in the right direction. AND it does nothing to 2nd amendment rights.

1507 2018-03-27 15:11:33 Do not want repeal of the second amendment.  Just common sense gun safety laws.  I do believe their should be restrictions on assault weapons, large magazine clips, and a ban of bump stocks. Gun owners should have to pass background checks as well.
1508 2018-03-27 15:10:47 NRA is largely to blame for the fact that assault weapons, large capacity magazines & modifiers like bump stocks are available. All of which multiply the lives lost in gun tragedies. This was not historically the NRA’s position. Nor does it have the support of the people.

1547 2018-03-27 14:56:40 Bump stocks we can live without. "Semi-automatic" is a category that even includes .22 caliber squirrel rifles. Not sure what you mean by a "mental health check." Domestic violence felons are already forbidden to have guns.
1548 2018-03-27 14:55:59 Repeal the second amendment trending is just a scam to get all gun owners riled up.  No majority wants to see this happen. We just want action on closing loop holes, banning bump stocks etc.  People s/b able to have guns.

1556 2018-03-27 14:53:49 Um, there's an executive order to change the current rule to make bump stocks illegal, that already happened. I think her point was more about whether mainstream gun owners want or even use bump stocks, they do not.

1558 2018-03-27 14:52:57 You are a bot for the nra how is making gun checks more consistent for mental health and eliminating bump stocks infringing on your rights. I normal person can still get a gun just not someone who has mental health issues.maybe if you list someone did a little education
1559 2018-03-27 14:52:47 While people shouted, Congress and President already started to act:
Sessions: Bump stocks illegal
Congress and President: Ominbus Bill:
1. Money for Instant Background checks - NICS
2. Money for School Safety and Training
3. Money for Mental Health awareness and gun violence
1560 2018-03-27 14:51:49 They should be banned ( bump stocks ) but they are not banned yet. And then you can get them with paying for tax and a background check if they do ban then. So there is not and never will be a total ban
1561 2018-03-27 14:51:34 -Stricter background checks, including a personal interview with the potential owner.

-A ban on bump stocks.
1562 2018-03-27 14:51:31 I watched many of the marches. I didn’t hear or see anything that called for a gun ban. Lots of signs calling for bans on semi-automatic and bump stocks, and general increases on restrictions to purchase, could be heard. I’m sure you didn’t intend to mislead in your tweet.
1563 2018-03-27 14:51:11 Saying bump stocks don’t kill a lot of people so there’s no need for them to be banned is dangerous. The death count in Las Vegas wouldn’t be half as high without them. Just because something is a statistical outlier doesn’t mean we should dismiss it.

Use your time for other things
1567 2018-03-27 14:50:05 It depends on what your definition of gun control is, mental health checks being carried out, if ppl have a stalking offence or domestic violence offence they should be banned, semi automatics and bumper stocks should be banned as there’s no need for a civilian to have one

1629 2018-03-27 14:24:11 It's never been about common sense gun laws and you know it. It's always been about doing away with the 2nd amendment. First it will be bump stocks and age. Next will be semi-automatics across the board, then shotguns. History has proven this formula time and time again.

1635 2018-03-27 14:22:09 In the midst of chaos, there is money to be made. When a pronouncement falls from Trump's mouth about trade, there are winners and losers. The winners are Trumps spawn as they short stocks & reap big gains. The losers are the rest of us who are clueless that this is coming.

1647 2018-03-27 14:19:38 That is a reasonable point of view.  By the way I have followed your work for a decade.  Also bullish gold and bearish both stocks and bonds as tightening money and credit will make cash King yet inflation will make gold Emperor. Stagflation and social crisis

1650 2018-03-27 14:18:17 With that comes repealing the 1st Amendment as well. But they won't even stop at that, Brigette.  They want to demolish our Constitution, our Country, our values. 

They'll take a mile if we give an inch. So, NO ban on bump stocks, NO raised age limits, etc.

1656 2018-03-27 14:16:25 Core positions in major ETF’s like DIA, QQQ, IVV for long because long term markets will go up. Picking stocks for day trades and doing well using this technique. Volatility great for trading. When like this I cut back a little on ETF’s add on trend back up
1657 2018-03-27 14:15:24 if you don’t think that someone in the medical field is underpaid, for instance a Walmart employee is paid more than most CNAs at any hospital/facility.

1658 2018-03-27 14:15:07 A reversal from last week; stocks had their biggest weekly decline in more than 2 years after the WH planned to hit China with tariffs  with $60 billion in imports and other restrictions. While China responded with a smaller tariffs, This sparked fears of more retaliation.

1661 2018-03-27 14:14:17 @KerriMPR should we think about "assault weapons" as short hand for fire power potential?  The Bump stocks show the true firing rates of the weapon.  stock AR-15 can shoot 4-5 round a second...that's crazy level of fire power for the average citizen.
1662 2018-03-27 14:14:10 I would say it's the opposite when it comes to stocks. Chances of hitting your target increase as the timeframe goes from short to medium to long
1663 2018-03-27 14:14:06 Do you use different brokerages? I have a Fidelity account and they will not let me trade certain pink sheet stocks. I was thinking about starting a new account. But maybe I could do two like you.

1666 2018-03-27 14:13:12 Sounds likely.
When my coworkers ask me why stocks are going down, I tell them that the real question they need to ask is why stocks ever went up so much in the first place.

1680 2018-03-27 14:09:50 PSU Banking stocks were biggest gainers  today (up 2.7%). NBFC, Mid-cap, Small Cap, Metal  stocks were major gainers today.
1681 2018-03-27 14:09:48 At a new 52-week high, everyone who bought in the past year is green and most want value not breakouts so they sell.  The breakout investors know this so they wait, and you get a huge dip before the retest.  I don't bet on stocks I bet on numbers and against buy/sell pressure.
1682 2018-03-27 14:09:43 China asks US to offset trade loss due to Metal Tariffs on Tuesday, news markets consider as positive, meaning China and the US are in talks to find a mutually agreeable approach to narrow the trade deficit gap.

1707 2018-03-27 14:04:35 Daily @StrategasRP factoid via @DanCliftonStrat: The average midterm election year correction in the S&P 500 is 18%. Historically, midterm election sell-offs tend to be great buying opportunities with stocks up one year later every time since 1962, and by an average of 36%!
1708 2018-03-27 14:03:46 Also. I’m sure the forefathers had no idea that this amendment would evolve into a right to carry a weapon of mass destruction or bump stocks. None of which were around at the time. What’s going to be tagged on to next?
1709 2018-03-27 14:03:22 Bump stocks are a gimmick. Shoot with one. You can't hit shit.

1719 2018-03-27 14:01:16 Don’t worry, they banned bump stocks so we’re all safer now...
1720 2018-03-27 14:00:54 No one in particular - Democrats prize individual thought. We don't have scores of TV and radio shows run by mock pundits like Hannity or Rush to tell us what to think. We make our own choices, e.g., I do not support repealing the 2nd Amd but I am for banning bump stocks.
1721 2018-03-27 14:00:53 This is wrong.  I'm fine with restricting assault weapons and bump stocks but the second amendment is essential to the Bill of Rights.

1739 2018-03-27 13:54:24 Liar.  Obama did not legalize bump stocks.  You complain about fake news but you generate it all the time.
1740 2018-03-27 13:54:01 It never was - we just want military-style weapons, large clips and bump stocks restricted. We'd like folks who have a gun to be registered (as they must to own a car) and taught in the proper use and care. And red flag laws to protect DV victims and the responding officers.
1741 2018-03-27 13:54:01 Random thought to define a bond bear market... what if we normalized it to stocks based on nominal yield vs historical return of stocks. 

For example... if a stock bear market is defined as a drawdown = 2x historical return (-20% vs 10%) then bond bear is 2x current yield?

what's your secret ? where do you find these stocks to bigin with ?
Thanks
1748 2018-03-27 13:50:39 Just to be clear, AR-15s are semi-automatic, it requires one pull of the trigger to fire each bullet
Fully automatic weapons have been illegal for a while already, which is why bump stocks are a thing and need to be banned now

No slut shaming (Grab 'em)

When I know I am trading high quality setups with great R/R I will scale in heavier and hold on for dear life as I day trade it in a seperate account!
1765 2018-03-27 13:45:09 Yeah. Make sense stocks go up and any random pattern occurs a few times over a 100 years.
1766 2018-03-27 13:45:00 Theme of past year: oil up, oil stocks lag. #PricingInSecularHeadwind
1767 2018-03-27 13:44:36 @GovLarryHogan Heard you on NPR about guns. PLEASE turn your back on NRA, their money, their grade A of you. Support: more school safety, more mental health in schools, increased background checks. Ban bump stocks. I'm a MD Mother. A voter. Enough!  #VoteThemOut2018 #MomsDemand
1768 2018-03-27 13:44:27 Bob says there’s no leadership in oil stocks.
1769 2018-03-27 13:43:53 Wrong. The 2A has many limitations. Convicted felons can't own guns,you have to be 21 to buy a handgun, concealed carry involves a host of hoops to jump through, now no bump stocks... And please read the Heller decision for a definition of "well regulated militia."

1771 2018-03-27 13:42:54 NICS will be a work in progress, since there are so many moving parts. ATF rule change re bump-stocks doesn't do much except provide fodder for litigation -- the underlying statute needs to be revised. As for GVRO's, that's why due process considerations are so critical.

1774 2018-03-27 13:41:05 All legal guns have one shot per trigger pull. Even semi automatic.  Bumb stocks are now illegal.
1775 2018-03-27 13:40:04 I think "Reform 2A" could get some traction. . . but of course the NRA will paint them as "Repeal 2A" even if all they want is to ban bump stocks or something. It's not just that moderation has few benefits; it's that being seen as a moderate -even if you are one- is impossible.
1776 2018-03-27 13:40:00 Haha kaya nga pero meron naman siguro baka sa mga maliliit na stores meron kasi un ibang mga kilalang stores minsan walang stocks. Wish ko lang sana makahanap si Bela para sumaya sya

1780 2018-03-27 13:39:39 The uncertainty today is whether something bad will happen. If Trump is serious about trashing the global trading system, there are few places for investors to hide. Stocks will suffer, the economy will slow and inflation will pick up."

1787 2018-03-27 13:37:26 There are plenty of reasonable gun owners who see the dangers of large magazines, bump stocks, etc. It's a mistake to alienate them.

1796 2018-03-27 13:32:37 One should think twice before buying into a commodity biz when Co already had several quarters of great performance.

1867 2018-03-27 13:02:28 Don’t repeal the Second Amendment. Common sense gun law reform including comprehensive background checks, increased mental health funding, raising age to 21 to buy a gun, banned bump stocks and assault weapons. #gunsense

1886 2018-03-27 12:55:08 Obfuscation. Answer the question. You really think that legally owned guns could outmatch the US government? A bunch of nut jobs with AR-15s and bump stocks? How did it go for the Malheur nut jobs? This is the zaniest part of your pathology.

1894 2018-03-27 12:54:16 Up next with @maggielake discussing trade negotiations with China and why #stocks are looking higher.
1895 2018-03-27 12:54:13 Once again u r a liar. No, Obama did not legalize bump stocks. You r a human lie detector. If u say it is true, America knows it is a lie. If u say it is a lie, we know it is true.

1898 2018-03-27 12:52:32 No, machine guns shouldn't be sold to the public and bump stocks should be illegal. Other than that, hell no it will never happen, in my community. Unless from our cold dead hands. Come on.

1900 2018-03-27 12:52:17 What tells you that commodities are a buy? I think I have a handle on when stocks or bonds are a buy but I haven't found a way of predicting commodities prices. Leading indicators of inflation might work as a signal, but maybe not.

1920 2018-03-27 12:42:42 Like what?  More regs that the govt won't enforce?  2 things have passed Congress already (Safety Act and a NICS fix) and the DOJ has banned bump stocks.
1921 2018-03-27 12:41:59 U.S. stocks are coming off the biggest weekly decline in more than two years, and the aftermath of that drop has market technicians warning that major indexes are on the verge of a full-fledged, technical breakdown.

1924 2018-03-27 12:40:54 I just buy Canadian pot stocks with mine.
1925 2018-03-27 12:40:44 Then what does it hurt to ban bump stocks then if "whack jobs" will find a way? It's a deterrence to help keep them out of the hands of bad people, even if it helps only a little. It's better than doing nothing at all.

1942 2018-03-27 12:34:35 Mmm hmm... When Mulroney was Prime Minister he spearheaded the global effort to address acid rain, address Apartheid, protected cod stocks, ratified the biodiversity agreement, added major national parks, and passed major environmental protection legislation.
1943 2018-03-27 12:34:15 Still in the stocks after all these years
1944 2018-03-27 12:33:30 Stocks continue to rebound after last week's drubbing as fears of a trade war with China begins to diminish.
1945 2018-03-27 12:33:29 4 D Chess. Who ever cared about bump stocks b4 Don brought it up.  Brilliant move!
1946 2018-03-27 12:32:04 The NRA, Rubio, Florida and the DOJ have all backed banning of bumper stocks.
1947 2018-03-27 12:32:03 Have your guns for hunting or self-protection, just not weapons like a AR-15 or Military style weapons, in the hands of citizens. Also, no magazine or bump stocks. Plus, stricter gun background checks. Keep America safer.
1948 2018-03-27 12:31:59 The NRA bought enough politicians to make something as simple as banning bump stocks hard to do. Remember after  Las Vegas how bump stocks were going to disappear. Still talking about that. Why? The NRA.

1953 2018-03-27 12:30:04 Step 1, short stocks.

Step 2, announce trade war with China

Step 3, cover stocks

Step 4 reach settlement with China. 

I hope SEC is watching for insider trading on companies affected by the trade threats.

1956 2018-03-27 12:29:15 Here's a compromise:
people who need to own assault "style" weaponry,automatic weapons,bump stocks, etc...should be able to purchase them legally.Ammunition for these weapons will no longer be sold. That way everyone can keep& bear arms.Even Marco agreed with some munitions ban
1957 2018-03-27 12:28:29 You prove time and again that a teacher you are not. You are unable to provide facts, charts, technicals, and DD. Instead of bashing stocks you should be encouraging traders. I hope newbies stay clear from you.

1961 2018-03-27 12:27:10 I am for gun reform of bump stocks etc. I’ve been sticking up for Nik and those emotionless kids in that school but i never knew Emma was the bully until yesterday. She is donzo know that her hypocrisy is being questioned.
1962 2018-03-27 12:26:53 Bump stocks är ju lagliga, dock, vilket innebär att det är både lagligt och enkelt att göra en halvauatomatisk AR-15 till en helautomatisk. M.a.o. är det distinktionen mellan halv- & helautomatisk som är kosmetisk i praktiken.

1969 2018-03-27 12:24:40 It’s a buy. All of this $FB negative news is like the negative news that tobacco causes cancer back in the 70s. Tobacco stocks were some of the best-performing assets over the last 40 years. You know why? Because of nicotine and $FB is more addictive than nicotine.
1970 2018-03-27 12:24:05 S'ils font le poids en Nutella, j'explose les stocks.
1971 2018-03-27 12:22:56 You’ll find very little push back on bump stocks. As for semi-auto rifles not “being suitable for untrained young adults”? I’m not sure what you’re getting at? No weapon is suitable for those untrained.
1972 2018-03-27 12:22:03 No lo se. Ademas los inventarios juegan su papel: el mundo tiene unos 5 años de media (japon tiene 100!). Pero cuando terminen contratos y stocks: has de ir a productor mas caro o incentivar precio y por tanto subida fuerte precios
1973 2018-03-27 12:21:08 81.3% of liquid stocks closed yesterday below their close on 3/12.  See $spy daily chart for why that might be important, then compare to your legacy longs.

1977 2018-03-27 12:18:30 Stocks and Treasuries still not uncorrelated.
1978 2018-03-27 12:18:27 This isn't a red or blue issue, it's a life or death issue.

If the NRA would support reasonable gun safety laws no one would have an issue with them. It's because they only support loosening laws that they are targeted.

Why do civilians need access to bump stocks? AR15s?
1979 2018-03-27 12:18:10 Automatkarbiner är, så vitt jag vet, inte tillåtna i USA. Det är halvautomatiska civila varianter och s.k."bump Stocks" som gör dom full auto dom bråkar om. Skillnaden mellan dessa "assault weapon" och vanliga gevär är mest kosmetisk och vapnet blir knappast farligare av det.

1981 2018-03-27 12:16:50 I'm afraid they are dismantling the EPA.

2008 2018-03-27 12:06:33 Monday's closes: TYM8 -4.50, FVM8 -3.75. Jun 10-year T-notes on Monday closed lower on reduced safe-haven demand for T-notes after stocks rallied on reduced trade-war concerns.

2032 2018-03-27 11:57:02 No, but we can find the obvious failure of the “good guy with a gun” theory. And if we go back in time just a few short months to Las Vegas we certainly can find bump stocks.

2045 2018-03-27 11:49:33 By using their vote! It’s not just bump stocks. They sensibly want to ban automatic weapons, raise the age for purchasing guns and improve background checks. And we manage quite well in Canada without guns! The US is in the 19th century.

2065 2018-03-27 11:33:29 Not "hiding" behind anything. Bump stocks are bump stocks. A piece of plastic attached to the stock of a gun. They do not convert semiautomatics into automatics. (pointing that out is not an appeal to semantics, its a way to describe a firearm's mechanism)

2092 2018-03-27 11:13:01 Yes, all veterans don’t agree, but those who agree with majority of American citizens don’t want AR15s in  hands of civilians. Nor bump stocks. These weapons are mass killers and mass killings have been on rise since lifting of the assault weapons ban. Need limits to 2nd amend

2105 2018-03-27 11:05:00 Hard to say. Especially for you. Punctuation is your friend. And your statement is ridiculous. Most of if not all the people shot in these school shootings died. There was no life support. And again we are talking bump stocks and background checks. Get over yourself.

2111 2018-03-27 11:00:08 Repeal, no. Amend, yes. All owners should pass extensive BG checks. All firearms must be locked away. One felony = no gun. Magazines over 10 rounds must be banned as well as bump stocks. Living in rural America, firearms are looked at differently than in the city I guess.
2112 2018-03-27 10:59:54 It is called leadership over semantics by not allowing something to happen. What if the Obama administration officials actually incorrectly concluded that new restrictions on bump stocks would “legally” require Congress’ approval rather than through executive branch action?
2113 2018-03-27 10:59:17 Are all his investments in war related stocks or is he just into death and destruction?
2114 2018-03-27 10:58:58 Not being able to buy bump stocks isn’t useless if you know what that does. It certainly isn’t unconstitutional, since you can still by the weapon. My point is, I can see where one might feel like they don’t care - it doesn’t make them liars to say so.
2115 2018-03-27 10:58:37 Correct.  I’m sure he won’t mind me saying, but @Chrisco11363793 was one of the guys who dodged a bullet.
2116 2018-03-27 10:58:35 Of course dems can't wait to pay themselves on the back and politicize something. Bump stocks should be banned but, you didn't do it by yourselves. How arrogant

2245 2018-03-27 09:02:46 Bump Stocks dude. They're for one thing - getting around the law against full auto weapons. There's no valid self-defense use for a  bump stock. It's only there to get around a law. 

They're sick, they should never have been legal, and I would love to see the Vegas victims sue.

2301 2018-03-27 08:22:24 4. Bump stocks are a gimmick. The same thing can be done with a rubber band or holding your finger in a certain position and letting the weapon bounce into it. It's wildly inaccurate and a waste of ammo.

2366 2018-03-27 07:28:41 Assault rifles absolutely must be banned. The age limit must be increased. Bump stocks banned. Large ammo clips are unnecessary. Please don’t misunderstand my comment. These are a beginning and we must go further than guns to solve the problem.

2372 2018-03-27 07:23:07 You can also forget Trump's promise to ban bump stocks.  The way he worded it (written for him by the NRA) would be impossible to accomplish and they know that. Turning a legal gun into an illegal machine gun, can't be done with a bump stock. One function to fire vs 2 functions

2387 2018-03-27 07:13:08 One thing about the tariffs, if we had done it long ago we would still have a manufacturing base.  Stocks are paper.  Real wealth did not decline.  The 99% don't have stock so the market doesn't matter to us.  What does is having wages driven to 3rd world rates and jobs wither
2388 2018-03-27 07:13:07 Could be a double whammy since traders have to pay quarterly taxes and dividends are paid in March as well (then traders dump those stocks buy others!) But Trump doing great job Ryan sending him under bus!

2392 2018-03-27 07:10:54 For quality stocks that is not an issue if fundamentals are sound and a decent cash cover for divi payments
2393 2018-03-27 07:10:06 Agreed except that P/E and especially Schiller P/E is THE MOST IMPORTANT and reliable indicator that stocks are over or undervalued. And that is what matters most, unless the FED and Govt. are playing games like they have the last 8 years.
2394 2018-03-27 07:09:09 @AsennaWealth so you’re saying there is nothing wrong with promoting stocks as a pack of influential investors on social media, most times after having got set well below where retail can, as long as you or clients make money ?
2395 2018-03-27 07:07:34 The world's first B2B platform which focuses on abrasive stocks live online!
2396 2018-03-27 07:06:47 Fine, I'm done. Until you can admit that P/E and Schiller P/E is extremely important and represents where US stocks SHOULD be (not some artificial FED prop), then you will never realize it was the FED and LUCK. Do you even know what a overvalued P/E is? You probably think 200 ok

2410 2018-03-27 07:00:06 Yes, but bump stocks bypass that. Hopefully, they’ll be banned soon, but just because new ones won’t be made won’t take away the ones already available. People who want them will find a way to get one.
2411 2018-03-27 06:58:59 Obama admin authorized sale of bump stocks on at least 2 occasions-those are the facts. 2010 he had the house and his ATF was unsure how to interpret the law-HE DID NOTHING ABOUT IT

2416 2018-03-27 06:55:03 For banking and financial stocks, p/e doesn't matters. It's p/b that one should look at. SBI p/e is in four figures, but it's not expensive as it's p/b is 1.13 right now.

2418 2018-03-27 06:54:00 You're right, of course.  However, they are bans, and as such, there's gonna be pushback.  The thing about magazines is that most AR-15's come with a 30 rounder.  And owners often have a bunch of 'em.  Practically nobody has bump stocks, though.

2428 2018-03-27 06:49:25 Everything Ben said was true. Mags are very easy to alter, universal BGCs would have to have every gun registered (never gonna happen) and bump stocks are novelties that have been used in 1 mass killing. The guy in LV is the only time I could find 1 used in a crime.

2485 2018-03-27 06:07:53 Australian stocks rose on Tuesday, buoyed by a big gain on Wall Street as markets began to believe a negotiated settlement of the US and China's differences was a more likely outcome than a full-blown trade war. The S&P/ASX 200 Index climbed 41.8 points, or 0.7%, to 5832.3.
2486 2018-03-27 06:07:49 Here's the thing I'm tired of people lying on God saying that anyone that disagree with them is hates God. No one is saying they want to do away with handguns or shotguns only long guns and bump stocks fake Christian whoremongers

There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. (131)
2494 2018-03-27 06:00:02 Asia stocks follow US shares up as trade war fears ease. France surrenders.
2495 2018-03-27 05:58:07 Why do you think millennial hedge funds give a rats ass about the environment? They will invest in anything that will make them money like the fund managers before and after them. Oil and gas stocks will be all time highs in 2-3 years. Mark my words.
2496 2018-03-27 05:55:49 1. You still don't understand the difference between a Right and a Liberty

2. Then say "this is about bump stocks" and move on. Its not, though. You're lying. You're dishonest.

3. I don't care

4. Another lie. Lie, lie, lie. Your movement has no end game.

2508 2018-03-27 05:48:12 As Odin Stocks mentioned, I’ve had issues since they started integrating Scottrade.  My charts were not working at times yesterday morning.
2509 2018-03-27 05:46:50 So the NRA is for anti-2nd Amendment proposals, Trump is making, since they are hard core Trump supporters? Trump has proposed FIVE gun control measures and just signed an EO for the banning of bump stocks.
2510 2018-03-27 05:46:14 even carefully selected stocks in bull market do fall 30 40 % in bear phase...so even selection was right and stock had tanked...it should not have tanked 50 60%...20-30% is decent number till this phase of market i guess.....if it start to tank beyond that...then :)
2511 2018-03-27 05:45:20 Is anyone interested in buying shares of stocks? I once had the same question.. I can make a video showing you how I got started and what online brokerage I used.
2512 2018-03-27 05:44:15 I already have an acct on COL. Nakalimutan ko na nga password ko. Haha. No time para bantayan stocks.
2513 2018-03-27 05:42:03 That’s not true lol. If you can get shot by a gun in school you can have an opinion in gun control. They’ve both said on numerous occasions that they don’t want to ban all guns, but certain ones in specific. For ex) AR’s and bump stocks.

2518 2018-03-27 05:36:03 Hahaha. The kid that actually says, “bump stocks. That’s a BUZZWORD everyone’s been talking about,” is the perfect example of how the protest accomplished nothing. It’s a way for them to fit in with what’s popular. Which is what HS kids do. What they won’t be doing is voting.
2519 2018-03-27 05:35:44 30 stocks don’t equal the economy. What about rising bond yields, higher deficits and falling dollar? Are you proud of those too?

2561 2018-03-27 05:08:08 3) Re: rate of fire, can we agree bump stocks aren't necessary? 4) Comprehensive gun laws could include mental health screening. It wouldn't prevent sane people from owning, it might only slow the purchase process. 5) EVERY gun purchase-including gun shows-should be regulated.

2596 2018-03-27 04:45:38 Trumps pretty hard line conservative when it comes to regulating a specific class of guns. I'll believe it when I see it

Perhaps he's liberal (antitradition) wrt to bump stocks
...tho what is the "traditional" view of such a new age accessory?
2597 2018-03-27 04:40:22 You’re being sold a bunch of lies by the NRA and your statement demonstrates that fact. We want AR-15s, bump stocks and high volume magazines banned. You can keep your handguns and rifles, if they’re licensed and you’re not a nut, a felon or possible terrorist.
2598 2018-03-27 04:40:15 This is were people are mistaken. An AR-15 is not a “military style weapon” it is a semi automatic rifle. It looks “illegal” and like a “military style weapon” because they often times have bump stocks on them. But you cannon hold the trigger down and fire like a military style

2609 2018-03-27 04:28:34 Will belt loops also be banned? They can function in place of bump stocks quit well. Saw nifty video last year demonstrating how.
2610 2018-03-27 04:28:26 Difference is stocks are a company that have a working platform with proven track record and profits. Name a crypto platform that has made money that isn’t derived from ICO input.

2619 2018-03-27 04:22:40 If Trump were truly in the NRA's pocket he wouldn't want to ban bump stocks or raise the age to 21. The age raise in particular is something the NRA is very against.
2620 2018-03-27 04:22:32 Exactly - The Cabal is pouring cash into Stocks to prop up the market to stop the Financial Shutdown.
2621 2018-03-27 04:20:44 Mga ka DDS kaya pa ba??sabagay wala namn pala kayo investment sa stocks??ang investment nyo lang ay sharing fake news
2622 2018-03-27 04:20:30 Trump also agrees with regulating some of the guns.  Trump did put a ban on bump stocks, Bush would never do such a thing
2623 2018-03-27 04:20:04 I support common sense gun reform 
Ex
-increased enforcement of background checks. bc its common sense to be cautious of who exactly youre providing with arms& also increases accountability
-ban on assault weapons&bump stocks. They dont hold any place in civilian life/society
2624 2018-03-27 04:19:42 Are bump stocks kind of pointless? Yes. However you can do the same thing using your thumb in a belt loop. They're just a gimmicky thing. The reason we don't want them banned- that's a slippery slope. prior to Vegas when have you ever heard of one? They've been around for years.
2625 2018-03-27 04:19:01 Supporters of the 2nd amendment? Hmm, I’m talking about extorters of the American representatives. We must be taking about different people. I’m talking about the propaganda mega structure that promotes bump stocks and military weapons for the average joe to take out 80 people.
2626 2018-03-27 04:18:57 Apparently a Mini-14 does not qualify.  But folding stocks with pistol grips are available and it uses the sane 30-round mags as other weapons.
2627 2018-03-27 04:18:36 They licked comb a stiletto stocks ?!?

2629 2018-03-27 04:16:51 It’s hilarious to see the positive tone that mainstream ‘analysts’ speak with when talking about stocks. Compare that to the endless doom and gloom of crypto.
2630 2018-03-27 04:15:44 I do believe that bump stocks should be illegal, but I don’t think say an AR-15 should be illegal because of what the amendment was written for, and then most of the homicides are committed by handguns
2631 2018-03-27 04:15:06 Like any of that means shit when trump got rid of all the banking regulations again, if you think your 401k or any stocks will be safe from a self made crash, your a moron!not only will they steal it, but they’ll make taxpayers bail them out again and then huge bonuses all around
2632 2018-03-27 04:15:02 @TuckerCarlson we really do not need bump stocks. I understand deer rifles, shotguns and hand guns also kill people, yet tell me why we need assault rifles to hunt large game or birds. Oh yes, stop yelling at guests
2633 2018-03-27 04:14:20 If you want me to teach you how to invest in penny stocks on the short run fav this and I’ll dm you with my link
2634 2018-03-27 04:11:21 Yes,  @true_pundit running a staury about Las Vegas shooting was anti-Trump motivated with Antifa and ISIS ties. And Parkland was a false flag and what does Trump do? Goes after bump stocks. They said give us an inch, we'll take a mile.
2635 2018-03-27 04:08:57 Man I don’t know how some people think. Whatever Trump does, they will blame on the media. This kind of mentality is what makes people like Trump gets away with their crimes. Don’t tell me the economy is doing good because stocks market is not benefiting poor people. It’s BS

2640 2018-03-27 04:07:01 Have you bothered to ask my views on housing? I've written about them. I don't want housing to be a commodity. It shouldn't be bought and sold like gold or silver or stocks. Harold Steves' motion on mansions in the ALR is right. It should pass.

2642 2018-03-27 04:05:45 I look at two things. BTC being a digital store of value...maybe a few other coins as hedges. And projects that will emerge in this internet 3.0, more like stocks than coins. The rest fades.
2643 2018-03-27 04:05:44 1. Rights have limitations.

2. The “march for our lives” movement is advocating for things like banning bump stocks... not guns! Jesus Christ you’re an idiot!

3. Duh, the CDC does.

4. The majority of people know exactly what this is all about. That’s your personal problem
2644 2018-03-27 04:05:44 Yes and I conceded that point in my earlier tweet. I have no problem with banning of certain “accessories” and in fact Trump has already banned numb stocks as of sometime last week. No skin off my back. My problem is that as quoted by one of the students at #MarchForOurLives:
2645 2018-03-27 04:04:18 Hey friend, I trade mostly stocks. But let me know your question, I'll see if I can answer it. 
2646 2018-03-27 04:03:40 $wfe lovely bounce. Stocks go up and they go down - it’s what is meant to happen.

2648 2018-03-27 04:02:38 With reduced govt borrowings calendar, expect more buybacks from PSUs in the Ist half...watch out for great buyback opportunities in the cash-rich PSUs...esp. in the beaten down stocks:-)
2649 2018-03-27 04:02:36 Yes, many stocks quote not updating and showing "#N/A"
2650 2018-03-27 04:02:17 How about stocks at premium?? 20 m worth?
2651 2018-03-27 04:01:42 Very sad that #Google ruined #googlefinance Looking for an alternative. They tried to make it "more accessible" and approachable, but now it's very near completely useless to anybody who actually trades stocks.
2652 2018-03-27 04:00:54 I never said pistols and rifles had selective fire, explain to me how the Las Vegas murderer was armed with multiple AR-15s, which were equipped with bump stocks that made it possible for him to empty into a crowd 100 bullets at a time with a single squeeze of the trigger.
2653 2018-03-27 04:00:38 Pls keep checking. More stocks will be available soon

2657 2018-03-27 03:59:49 Now I personally have no problem banning certain “accessories” such as bump-stocks and high capacity magazines. They are usually unnecessary in use. Only accessories I view as certainly useful are lights, sights, and grips.
2658 2018-03-27 03:59:25 You're bringing bump stocks back?
2659 2018-03-27 03:58:09 Our city just banned bump stocks today. We are one of the first cities in the nation.
2660 2018-03-27 03:55:56 1. All Rights are worth fighting for. I refuse to trade Freedom for Security. 
2. Bump Stocks, I don't like them. But I'm not going to ban a firearm over a modification. 
3. Someone has to keep track of suicides. 
4. No. No one does. I want less government, not more government.
2661 2018-03-27 03:55:06 You can create a google sheet and use =googlefinance("VOO") to look up all the stocks you care about.  Also has features like =googlefinance(".INX", "changepct") to follow the market live.  Hoping they don't get rid of this feature...
2662 2018-03-27 03:54:56 So we should legalize flamethrowers then? 
Common sense, and I know that's asking a lot, would suggest that the line should be drawn at military style weapons. AR-15s and similar rifles do massive damage. 
We should also get rid of high capacity magazines and bump stocks.

2695 2018-03-27 03:38:03 Citi Group said it would require retailers to place restrictions on the sale of guns to anyone under the age of 21, to stop selling bump stocks and high-capacity magazines and to perform background checks. Otherwise, it would not do business with them.

2717 2018-03-27 03:24:44 That’s not a repeal.  

Also in the article it shows that until the threat of ban on bump stocks. They were not popular until the left hysteria, then dealers couldn’t keep them in stock.
2718 2018-03-27 03:24:18 Will future generations value precious metals and stocks like previous generations? Less ppl are staying at one job long enough to accrue a 401k.  Ppl have less trust in Wall Street and traditional markets.  Gold is not practical for exchange but digital currencies are

2728 2018-03-27 03:19:51 Shorting is when you sell stocks you do not own, because you believe their prices will be lower in the future and you will "buy" them back cheaper, then keep the difference. Some accounts will allow you to do that (I think it should be illegal).

2773 2018-03-27 02:54:16 He’s just signed an Omnibus that fortifies our schools w/strict safety measures, he’s banning bump stocks &realigning FBI to insure background checks and tip lines which have become negligent & corrupted. But you’re more interested in deflection & mud slinging, aren’t ya?
2774 2018-03-27 02:53:38 That's part of the problem-those parts. Fortunately POTUS chose wisdom and banned bump stocks

2795 2018-03-27 02:46:58 I too am a gun owner, former NRA member, and I support an assault weapons ban, ban on bump stocks, large magazines, universal background checks (i.e., no gun until check is complete) and red flag measures.

This week they really did ban bump stocks. No one even noticed, bc these kids give no f*cks about the band-aids. They are not stopping until the problem is TOTALLY SOLVED.

2839 2018-03-27 02:25:47 OK -- so you agree with the "foul-mouthed kids" on bump stocks. Assault STYLE rifles like the AR 15 aren't, and they can be made fully automatic in ways other than that. It CAN be legislated, of course -- why couldn't it? Make your case. Mental health isn't enforced...
2840 2018-03-27 02:25:31 Tbh the  only reason I don’t move out is because my mom stocks the house with the best munchie foods 
2841 2018-03-27 02:25:25 I saw this one clears 90 cents a quarter,  its selling at 2:20 cents, stocks make no sense most times
2842 2018-03-27 02:24:06 Some duhs: Bump stocks shouldn’t be legal. There should be a license involved if you need huge military type guns. People convicted of violent crimes shouldn’t be able to buy guns.
2843 2018-03-27 02:23:54 It didn’t work out so well for @sacca (day trading stocks)
2844 2018-03-27 02:23:44 Look, he's six feet tall. He's never been at this height. It's a RECORD! Even when he's old and starts shrinking, he's moving down from a record... By the way, Rockefeller, the DOW is only 30 stocks. The 30 can change. If you don't own one of the 30...how many do u own?
2845 2018-03-27 02:23:42 are you saying that he will vote down the brexit deal if the UK doesn't have full control over fish stocks during the transition period?
2846 2018-03-27 02:23:33 Weren't the stocks up past 26?
2847 2018-03-27 02:23:15 I am beyond happy that the target in Hanford fully stocks @ProfusionCo
2848 2018-03-27 02:22:57 Agree with you. Indices feel heavy, stocks feel heavy, even those names going up during these snap back rallies feel algo, cover type situations. Who’s plowing in more money at these levels especially as tech is about to get hit for data for example FB in process, then GOOGL.
2849 2018-03-27 02:21:51 Thinking of starting investing in stocks but I'd like to know your trusted platforms for it. Watchu guys use?
2850 2018-03-27 02:21:36 Time to end the Dow Jones index of 30 stocks. We have things called computers that can compute the value of all stocks. Time for a paradigm shift in how we report the stock market, #endIndex
2851 2018-03-27 02:21:20 Yes, that is technically true, but bump stocks can turn it into an assault weapon. And anyway, IIRC, they can penetrate a steel helmet at something like 500 feet.

2853 2018-03-27 02:20:51 Brian, can you please help me to understand your line of work. After Vegas, everybody bitched for weeks about bump stocks. Is it correct that Trump ended the sale of BS. If so how? And why is there no coverage, this is big news is it not?
2854 2018-03-27 02:20:45 Tonight at 10: A father of five is dead after a shooting near 47th and Cooper. Plus, the city council voted and bump stocks will soon be illegal inside city limits. Tune in for the latest. #LNK
2855 2018-03-27 02:20:12 But the @NRA and 2A Defenders can't see past their AR15s. Nobody needs that kind of weapon to protect their family. Militia doesn't mean bump stocks and high capacity magazines and the government has waaaaay more weapons than citizens will ever have so your 2A isn't gonna keep
2856 2018-03-27 02:20:09 Who cares who legalized the bump stocks. YOU make them ILLEGAL. Period.
2857 2018-03-27 02:19:49 

My own business. 3 businesses actually. Lawn care, trading stocks, internet business.
2858 2018-03-27 02:18:59 F&O Ban stocks for 27-3-2018:

    In ban: IFCI, Jet Airways, JP Associates and Oriental Bank.

    New in ban: JP Associates.

    Out of ban: HDIL, IDBI Bank.

2860 2018-03-27 02:16:12 If you paid attention they want stricter background checks, ban military assault rifles, bum stocks and gun show loop holes.
2861 2018-03-27 02:16:02 reading is literally the most relaxing part of my day, how do ppl not do it
2862 2018-03-27 02:14:56 What buffett wannabees also ignore is that he's a mathematical genius with an amazing brain for numbers! At 10-11 years of age he could rattle off the population of all major cities. That's why he can remember almost all balance sheets of most listed stocks. So he can't be copied
2863 2018-03-27 02:13:29 told my mum to buy stocks yesterday
2864 2018-03-27 02:13:10 Yes. The index etfs on the S&P and the Dow will bid up those stocks artificially. How much higher? That's the part I don't know for sure. -J
2865 2018-03-27 02:11:14 Is this 'want' similar to Trump's 'proposing' bump stocks?  There are stronger ways to compel...
2866 2018-03-27 02:09:58 I was just thinking this as I read the Bloomberg headline "U.S. Stocks Jump in Best Day Since 2015" We just had the worst day since 2015 Friday lol
2867 2018-03-27 02:09:12 In Oregon, in December and January, you can easily transplant many types of evergreens such as fir trees, transplanting seedlings from a variety of seed stocks can build up the natural resistance, forests were never meant to be one specie clones.
2868 2018-03-27 02:07:57 DUMB LOGIC! 
To buy condo for $828,000 in #SiliconValley in 2018 one should have had $130,000 in stock options or tech stocks or inheritance 10 years ago. Anyone who moved from Houston TX or average American should have that. If you don't why are u a buyer anyway?
2869 2018-03-27 02:07:36 momentum stocks- got to trade them like momentum stocks!
2870 2018-03-27 02:07:20 Trading stocks is like life: long-term growth with short-term adjustments. #investing
2871 2018-03-27 02:07:12 ...the bullshit conspiracy theory that banning bump-stocks and having background checks is a slippery slope. Some people shouldn't own guns and with your obvious lack of intelligence, I think there should be an IQ test as well as background checks. Because fuck you, that's why.
2872 2018-03-27 02:07:00 Came up in my scan today with only 10 other stocks. What does that mean? I have no idea. Lol #looksgood
2873 2018-03-27 02:06:52 So this is what it is like when America leads!
Great Stocks
Better trading

Press on Sir!
Press on!
2874 2018-03-27 02:05:20 ALGOP already putting 10 Commandments measure on fall ballot to rile up the Christian Soldier base. Good thing legislative session is almost over, they’d try to top Indiana w stonings, maybe bring back stocks on the square
2875 2018-03-27 02:04:50 Thanks for the comment. Not sure I follow your reference to “non index stocks”?  Are you referring to stocks too small to be in a particular index (S&P 500)?
2876 2018-03-27 02:04:09 Meghan McCain totally missed the point of the march. The assualt guns/bump stocks need to be banned first to stop this problem. The accessiblity to them is too easy. Yes there are other things to be done for safety but it starts with the guns first
2877 2018-03-27 02:04:07 I learned very important lessons from first 100 page like making  money working for me, buying  assets, buying stocks of small companies and not wasting money in unimportant things that take money from my wallet but buying things that put money in my wallet.
2878 2018-03-27 02:03:55 They are in the process of banning bump stocks. The number of rounds wouldn’t stop someone planning a mass murder. They would have additional weapons. You can’t continuously fire nonstop from an AR-15 because the heat generated will warp the barrel.
2879 2018-03-27 02:02:05 announce it @vergecurrency  your stocks are tanking, TRX is having some moves!
2880 2018-03-27 02:01:35 And the LORD said, "Let there be Bump Stocks, for this pissy thing won't cause enough innocent children to BE Murdered Without one". - Fucknutians 4:13 RWNJ
2881 2018-03-27 02:01:22 I too hold the belief that passive investing is the way to go, but believe that the non index stocks will have better growth potential. It's a trade off to reduce risk.-J
2882 2018-03-27 02:01:20 @marcorubio You need to understand that it is only assault weapons and bump stocks that most are asking to be banned.  They are not protected under the 2nd and do not belong in homes. They do devastating damage.
2883 2018-03-27 01:58:15 There is no good or bad time to enter quality stocks. However considering the current volatile market scenario would suggest you to add 25% now and rest 75% on every dip you get of the total amt you want to invest!!

Don't try to time it, buy it and forget it!!
2884 2018-03-27 01:57:30 To a certain extent yes they are applicable to ETFs, but they work best on individual stocks.
2885 2018-03-27 01:56:47 The S&P/#ASX200 added 0.6% to 5,825 points. All sectors bounced back with #technology stocks leading the way. #Financials were mixed with $CBA and $WBC up 0.7% and 0.5% respectively, $ANZ was flat while $NAB was down 0.2%.
2886 2018-03-27 01:55:44 The movement does want the guns it is a process. Starts with bump stocks then assault weapons and you know what’s next? The problem is with psychopaths 
not law abiding citizens we didn’t do anything.
2887 2018-03-27 01:55:39 Give them an inch.........   that’s why NO on banning bump stocks!
2888 2018-03-27 01:55:39 And bump stocks are going to be made illegal. Umm you’re the one who made the uninformed comment.  You can modify other guns too so should we ban them too? Get rid of shotguns because they can be modified to a sawed off shotgun.
2889 2018-03-27 01:55:38 Selling all of my banana stocks!
2890 2018-03-27 01:55:33 Aren't bump stocks a thing for disabled people to use while hunting?  Those who don't have "normal" hand function?

Clearly I don't know much about them.
2891 2018-03-27 01:52:26 Stocks are going to be fine @LandM_Marius. Crypto is going to have to survive and thrive with a robust DJ. Stop throwing around stock FUD.

More to our Members.

Yesterday's Jackpot was 10100 call from Rs 15 to 80+ in single day.

2893 2018-03-27 01:51:45 Which stocks was it ?
2894 2018-03-27 01:51:40 Problem with this is, it’s tough to find stocks liquid enough to be swing around 50k plus trades that will give you those 20% gains
2895 2018-03-27 01:50:40 So ur sad because i "probably" dont own stock? And im "dumb"? Wow, well that escalated quickly. I dont trust stocks, but having a 401k kinda requires me to keep an eye on em. God bless u fellow american.
2896 2018-03-27 01:50:38 Fuck the law 'cause we're enough. 
Fuck the boss 'cause we're enough.
Fuck Microsoft 'cause we're enough. 
Fuck owning stocks 'cause we're enough.

Fuck you 'cause we're enough.
2897 2018-03-27 01:50:17 $SPY So if I read correctly, many think if stocks are going down they're going down and if they're going up there going down?  huh?  lol  :)
2898 2018-03-27 01:50:02 @arcane_trail where do you see junior mining stocks on TSX Venture going in 2018?
2899 2018-03-27 01:49:57 I bought tech stocks with my student loans in 1999 and paid it off after I graduated in 2003-2007 at $50/Mo @ 0% interest. 

Nothing wrong with it as long as you’re educated on what you’re trading. 

Yes, even crypto.
2900 2018-03-27 01:49:40 Wishful thinking, probably.  For sure will be universal background checks, smaller magazines, and banning of bump stocks. Hard to see an assault weapons ban since it doesn't really do anything. More cops in schools too, not a good thing, kids going to school in prison conditions.
2901 2018-03-27 01:48:03 Wait for some more time It can go till 510 levels, also crude is bullish as of now which can have negative impact on aviation stocks.
2902 2018-03-27 01:47:55 Ban bump-stocks.
Legalize silencers as they are for protection. 
A universal background system is necessary to keep guns out of the hands of those who can't legally own them 
And limiting mag. capacity creates chance for good guy to stop bad guy.

2904 2018-03-27 01:47:11 But I have watched gun videos and found them instructive. Once I had to research bump stocks and tannerite. There are plenty of videos on both. Both depict legal activity, or did. I see no equivalence between murder/rape and someone demonstrating how an instrument is used.
2905 2018-03-27 01:46:39 Now would it not be fair to give those business stocks to the families of slaves who built the company
2906 2018-03-27 01:46:19 Although the Obama administration was much more supportive of gun control than the Trump administration, it repeatedly declared that bump stocks were legal, meaning that banning them would require a new act of Congress. Sen. Dianne Feinstein a dogged gun controller, agrees.
2907 2018-03-27 01:46:07 Stocks will have another BIG up day tomorrow
2908 2018-03-27 01:43:49 There were no bump stocks
2909 2018-03-27 01:43:42 Penny stocks hit today?
2910 2018-03-27 01:43:19 Anderson what did Obama do about gun control after the Sandy Hook shootings?  He did sign for legalization of bump stocks.....
2911 2018-03-27 01:41:47 If it was stupid, stocks wouldnt come back up so fast. But they always bounce back cuz our economy is booming higher ev day
2912 2018-03-27 01:41:11 I accidentally hit the space bar after I typed “dow” and instead of autocorrecting to “down,” which was what I intended to type, it autocorrected to Dow...?
My FBI agent has a lot to learn if he thinks I know anything about stocks.
2913 2018-03-27 01:40:58 @Emma4Change I hope you run for office! Be the change that the country needs! Your next mission should be to make people aware of binary triggers that are just as bad if not worse than bump stocks. They should be banned as well. You go girl!
2914 2018-03-27 01:40:54 Most correct headline about Thursday, Friday, Monday #StockMarket action: "#ComputerSellers push down #stocks last week using #TradeWar 'fears' as excuse; then #ComputerBuyers make money pushing #stocks right back up."
2915 2018-03-27 01:40:03 The stock mkt. is not a partisan thing. It is reported daily on every newscast. Liberals have stocks too.
2916 2018-03-27 01:38:48 Oh, yes we will take your assault rifles, your bump stocks, and your high capacity magazines. Don’t take my word for it? Fine. That doesn’t change the outcome. Community safety is EVERYONE’S business and that leads us into everyone’s gun safes.
2917 2018-03-27 01:38:37 Where were you last three weeks pos president??  Stocks are lower now than the close of last year.  You are beneath the office you occupy
2918 2018-03-27 01:37:51 - Restrctions on sale of
-- assault-style weapons
-- bump stocks (& other means of converting semi-automatic to automatic)
-- high-cap magazines
- Age restrictions (if you can't drink or vote, you can't buy a gun)
- Mental health restrictions
- No-fly list (no-fly = no-gun)
2919 2018-03-27 01:37:34 There will be some companies which can still grow against all odds, sensex/nifty is just an indication. We can pick and choose gems  among 6000 listed companies in India and can also explore outside India for quality stocks.
2920 2018-03-27 01:37:08 Hmmm I am wondering why that article makes no mention of drum magazines which hold 100 rounds and bump stocks which simulate full automatic fire, i would be fine banning those two things if then the AR-15 type weapon becomes a regular 30 round or less hunting rifle
2921 2018-03-27 01:37:00 Naw I think it will add much more credibility to off white tbh, like this is a huge accomplishment. They asked him to be the creative director and bet his off white stocks going up.
2922 2018-03-27 01:36:48 Trump should just remove Marijuana from the controlled substance list instead of banning bump-stocks that hardly anyone owns and won't make any difference.
2923 2018-03-27 01:34:51 #MAGA 600 points gains in stocks market after trade tensions ease between  and 
2924 2018-03-27 01:33:54 Both look like @TylerWoolbright legs
2925 2018-03-27 01:33:34 Agree. $DEEL this could pop to .50-1.00 easily. People that think not....... take a look at the rise the past 6 days people!
2926 2018-03-27 01:32:36 As per our view.... The Mkt may have bottomed out or can bring bit of volatility going forward. But we are sure that some of the stocks have bottomed out and not much weekeness seen going forward. @CNBCTV18Live @BTVI @ZeeBusiness @ETMarkets
2927 2018-03-27 01:32:03 Oh, and here’s another one. You can make a working AR15 in a 3D printer. Like drug gangs can’t buy 50 or 60 3D printers. Oh, they make bump stocks too. But, yeah, let’s take guns. Then NOBODY will have them.
2928 2018-03-27 01:31:57 Stacking penny stocks while I'm flipping these birds 
2929 2018-03-27 01:31:53 I voted for a President, not a Pastor! Consent = LEGAL!... don't care! Unemployment is down, stocks are up, SANITY reigns once again! GO TRUMP.... THANK GOD!!
2930 2018-03-27 01:30:53 Kids run into classrooms and lock doors.  The gunman went room to room.  He didn't need big mags or a bump stock.  What would have saved the kids were better doors!

Vegas guy had expensive weapon not available to most pyschos.  His barrel overheated because bump stocks are dumb.
2931 2018-03-27 01:30:24 The action is only one thing though right? I’m pretty sure it’s designed to not get hot even when fired many many times. This makes modifications such as bump stocks and high capacity magazines possible. I wonder why these sorts of things are necessary.
2932 2018-03-27 01:29:54 I am unconstrained, dynamic, and flexible. 

I'm willing to go long or short stocks, rates, commodities, currency, or volatility. 

I apply systems for directional trends and countertrends across varied time frames.
2933 2018-03-27 01:28:47 stocks are addicting
2934 2018-03-27 01:28:39 They will have bucket stocks.
2935 2018-03-27 01:28:02 Let's be real. 21 to buy a gun. You need to get the training and a background check. Bump stocks are a bad idea. Outlaw them. Everyone can wait 3 days.
2936 2018-03-27 01:27:42 Stocks: wide volatile range trade can be sign of smart money getting out. Called 'distribution'. Watching.
2937 2018-03-27 01:27:42 It is regrettable that I rarely get to do grocery shopping back home cos that supermarket in Balagtas stocks on items like lactose-free whole milk & Belvita biscuits. & if I'm being lucky, original Tim Tams
2938 2018-03-27 01:26:21 Woohoo...wait a minute I dont have any stocks  may help the country but doesn't help me lol
2939 2018-03-27 01:26:17 The implication that they published that study specifically to "take down stocks" is a really paranoid fantasy unless there is some kind of proof or evidence of that.  Lots of studies fail to replicate.
2940 2018-03-27 01:25:47 Ooh... Wow this is Rajasthan Royals'  player in big leag ***IPL###  Ben stocks! Amazing man......
2941 2018-03-27 01:25:36 I haven't forgotten about Vegas. I agree with reclassifying bump stocks as machine guns in accordance with the 1986 law. The only problem that I have with such a revision to the law is that would have to be worded carefully so that the rifle isn't banned because of an accessory.
2942 2018-03-27 01:25:26 Bump stocks are easily made on a 3D printer. Nearly entire guns are being made on printers at home, now...
2943 2018-03-27 01:25:14 New stocks in today
2944 2018-03-27 01:23:44 European stocks fell on Monday, as a surging euro squashed an early rally that had been sparked by an easing in recent trade-related tensions.

2946 2018-03-27 01:23:36 Technology stocks regained some ground as Microsoft surged 7.6%, Intel leapt 6.3%, Alibaba advanced 5.1% and Apple climbed 4.8%. Facebook, however, lost a further 0.4% after the Federal Trade Commission said it was investigating the company’s privacy practices.
2947 2018-03-27 01:23:28 US stocks rose on Monday, with major indices partially rebounding from their worst weekly performance in more than two years.
2948 2018-03-27 01:22:52 Stocks: Nice rebound on schedule. Doesn't mean anything by itself. Short term peak due this week dating from high of year.
2949 2018-03-27 01:22:40 Yes, for the most part! We’re also trying  ban bump stocks/automatics and eliminate loopholes! But we don’t want to get rid of guns
2950 2018-03-27 01:22:23 Of course when he attacks a country with tariffs or taxes investors get scared shit and drop stocks. But once the initial drop comes in prices it usually comes back.
2951 2018-03-27 01:22:09 Maybe we can invite him to the Power Stocks and $TWTR fan club.   He luvs it when our shit is not working.
2952 2018-03-27 01:21:45 so the stream deck is 50 bucks off and still no word on stocks of their capture cards... hmmm. @elgato prolly not gonna buy either. seems like your selling water for a fire. prove me wrong.
2953 2018-03-27 01:21:34 Lowest Black and Hispanic unemployment ever. Thanks to Obama and yes Donald J. Trump!
He's outlawed bump stocks and will do more thoughtful work on gun control.
2954 2018-03-27 01:20:55 First bump stocks then assault weapons. #expelliarmus
2955 2018-03-27 01:20:17 Y'all still on that bump stock shit? 1 I seen reports he didn't even actually have one in vegas 2. Even if he did how many bump stocks were used in mass shootings? Y'all are sheep on shit you're told to baaa baaaa to.
2956 2018-03-27 01:19:59 Then you are a willfully horrible reporter - many of us are gun owners. We do not want to take guns needed for self-defense & hunting. We do want: better background checks, no gun show loopholes, no bump stocks, gun owners must prove responsibility & training, age limits, etc etc
2957 2018-03-27 01:19:28 Really? What about the millionaire in Las Vegas who shot almost 600 people with no signs of mental illness? A ban on assault weapons, large capacity cartridges and bump stocks could have saved a lot of lives.
2958 2018-03-27 01:19:07 His family is probably trading stocks to cash in.
2959 2018-03-27 01:18:47 looks like you guys need some ARs and bump stocks up there - if you ask nice we'll throw in CNN and those damn kids too... We still have Piers Morgan to save your queen... help a brutha out!

2961 2018-03-27 01:18:00 Stocks are fuckin confusing can somebody help me.
2962 2018-03-27 01:16:53 Have you forgotten Las Vegas already? Why weren't bump stocks banned the next day? Why not in 2013 when the bill was offered to do so?
2963 2018-03-27 01:16:15 Alex, I'm not excusing BAML but if every firm operating a dark pool violates the rules, the problem is rules mandating an impossible structure. No market has endless supply. The market is overly dependent in too many stocks on too few dealers. Why? Rules, @SEC_News.
2964 2018-03-27 01:16:09 Dude i’ve been playing way too much fortnite and looking at stocks way too much i just had a dream that the storm in fortnite took off dollars of my portfolio and i’m not proud

"As is too often the case, Donald Trump seems confused about the details of something he claims to care about. In this case, it's bump stocks and guns." -- Steve Benen
2966 2018-03-27 01:13:46 Renaissance's flagship Medallion fund: " From 1994 through mid-2014 it averaged a 71.8% annual return. " <---- NOBODY makes a 71.8% annual return on stocks.
2967 2018-03-27 01:13:27 Both lol , since HS I have 3 stocks I invested in but I fell off from monitoring them 
2968 2018-03-27 01:13:26 You realize stocks have been plummeting because of your terrible trade judgements?
2969 2018-03-27 01:12:20 The ar does not fire a heavy round. Its purpose is to fire one round for each trigger pull. Same as any semi automatic. You wanna talk bump stocks I'll agree with you all day. Gun control advocates want compromise from the other side. Our rights can't be compromise.
2970 2018-03-27 01:11:30 @tthickaz_ you liked that cause u fuck wit stocks Or u like that cause its sucks that noone fucks wit stocks? Lol
2971 2018-03-27 01:11:10 #MikeTheMiz is just too much fun. #BoDallas and #RealCurtisAxel have seen their stocks rise. Finn and Seth look like a tag team instead of rivals. #WWE #RAW and a Miztourage swerve.
2972 2018-03-27 01:11:09 AR-15's need to be banned. I'm also happy to report, that just today, my city banned bump stocks. Gun laws vary from state to state, or even city to city. We need gun reform on the Federal level.
2973 2018-03-27 01:10:08 But stocks are down. Clearly your powers of persuasion need work.
2974 2018-03-27 01:08:49 But AR-15s with jump stocks totes cool
2975 2018-03-27 01:08:18 So, not bans on the guns themselves, correct? Bans on bump stocks and clips makes total sense.
2976 2018-03-27 01:08:09 Damn so not one person on my timeline fuck with stocks? 


2977 2018-03-27 01:07:42 You are bragging about how good the stocks are!! You also need to take responsibility for the losses 2!!
2978 2018-03-27 01:07:26 When you mention "gold stocks" which ones do you have in mind?

2990 2018-03-27 00:55:30 Stock markets will fall out - they don't like instability. Summer stocks should ride along the 22,000-17,000. @potus will find a way to drag out chaos to keep attention on himself. He DENIES Americans a place at the trade tables for valued positions.
2991 2018-03-27 00:53:50 Stocks hit high again! There's going to be some up's & downs until the trade dust settles! Just wait! It's going to work out in America's favor. I can't believe your rooting against the USA! Unbelievable!

2997 2018-03-27 00:50:17 Stocks closed sharply higher on Monday, bouncing back from strong losses in the previous session as trade tensions between the U.S. and China appeared to ease.
The Dow Jones industrial average surged 669.40 points to 24,202.60. - A Dead Cat Bounce ?
2998 2018-03-27 00:50:17 Obama admin DID NOT make bump stocks legal. Existing code did not make them illegal. Look it up.
2999 2018-03-27 00:49:34 Most products either have to be defective, or be sold illegally or improperly for manufacturers/sellers to be liable - like any other product.  Or just make assault rifles and huge magazines and bump stocks illegal.

3003 2018-03-27 00:48:47 @SenateFloor bump stocks are already illegal,atf rules and regulations under machine guns
3004 2018-03-27 00:48:26 Semiautomatics, large capacity mags, & bump stocks shouldn't be owned by civilians. They are military type weapons designed to kill large numbers quickly. They're useless against govt. tyranny; a drone or Apache would smoke your ass. They'll be banned in the future. Count on it.
3005 2018-03-27 00:48:23 Stop lying. The idea is common sense gun control, not taking you rights or all your guns. Assault weapons have no place in civilian life. Nor do bump stocks, high capacity mags, or grenade launchers.

3016 2018-03-27 00:45:24 A start for banning would be getting rid of AR-15 and bump stocks. That’s what I would call “less dangerous guns”. As far as everything else, I would push for less ammunition for the other guns and tighter restrictions on who can get them
3017 2018-03-27 00:44:37 "When they give us an inch with the bump stocks ban we'll take a mile"
3018 2018-03-27 00:44:13 Yeah right! The stocks are surely way overdue a big correction to, which I wouldn't want them bringing cryptos down with it

All guns registered
All owners licensed
Mandatory liability insurance
No assault weapons
No bump stocks

3026 2018-03-27 00:40:01 I know if I put money into stocks and it triples, I pay tax on it.
I made that money out of my smarts. It cost society nothing for it to be transferred to me. The government didn't help me make it.
But I pay this, dare I say, 'envy tax' because I can afford to. 
Because society.

3032 2018-03-27 00:35:59 Democrats do not want to do away with the 2nd Amendment. I want universal background checks, closing gun show loopholes nationwide, enforce gun restrictions on anyone convicted of ANY domestic violence offense, a mental health registry, no mags >10 rounds, ban bump stocks.
3033 2018-03-27 00:34:54 Asia stocks begin positive as region takes impetus from the recovery on Wall St amid easing trade war concerns.
3034 2018-03-27 00:34:27 Who's acting stupid? An AR 15 is not an assault weapon, it doesn't shoot hundreds of rounds (bullets) a minute. Bump stocks should be illegal. It's already illegal to modify a gun to turn it into an assault (or automatic) weapon, bump stocks kinda fit that description.

3037 2018-03-27 00:33:06 I think we need to improve the existing background check system. I'd like voluntary bgc's on private sales. I'd be OK with bump stocks being regulated like machine guns. Other than that, I say we address motives.

The quotes was in reference to 'right'.
3038 2018-03-27 00:32:53 @davidhogg111 You blamed @DLoesch for Bump stocks however the Obama administration approved the sale of bump fire stocks, btw NOT TRUMP. How can we trust your statements when facts are incorrect?  Please debate Kyle. @KyleKashuv

3045 2018-03-27 00:29:01 Honestly the one thing I don’t understand is why the NRA fights so hard to prevent bump stocks, and so-called assault rifles from being manufactured

3048 2018-03-27 00:27:24 You hypocrite, fast and furious.....your gun running program got Americans killed. Obama legalized bump stocks. Vote for what, Nancy Pelosi so she can raise Americans taxes? What did your administration do after Sandy Hook? Holder is a POS

3050 2018-03-27 00:26:35 Also 'ban bump stocks and at least there won't be as many killed'. When there's a school shooting, ask the parents of the one kid killed. Pretty sure it won't make them feel any better or give them any relief.

3053 2018-03-27 00:25:03 Dude. DUDE. Listen to me: The stock market is not the economy. Stocks can do well, even while Joe & Jane Sixpack are struggling. Conversely, Joe & Jane Sixpack can be doing okay, even when stocks are sinking. 

Bottom line: how the stock market is doing is irrelevant.
3054 2018-03-27 00:24:49 I absolutely agree with you! There has to be a change, because the violence is out of hand. The @NRA spews so much fear propaganda that people cling to their weapons like security blankets. Not one person needs a combat style rifle or bump stocks. No one!

3071 2018-03-27 00:17:49 These pullbacks for no reason happen all the time in the world of pot stocks. Either you don’t hold for long or you learn to develop thick skin. Look at the dips in canopy the last few months. Volatility is a blessing and a curse in this sector
3072 2018-03-27 00:17:05 @onesun If a stocks departs from the planned Launch Price significantly,  or the chart in no longer technically attractive I scrub it.
3073 2018-03-27 00:16:44 Universal--no loopholes--background checks. Registration of gun purchases and transfers like automobiles. Ban of semi-automatic assault rifles, large capacity magazines, and bump-stocks. Mandatory training/certification and retraining. Violate laws and your guns are gone.

We are supporting ban on semi automatics and bump stocks; universal background checks consistently enforced; increased mental health services; school security measures( not arming teachers). Sheesh- too lazy to research?  Blocked bot!
3088 2018-03-27 00:08:58 I want to start investing in stocks and in my retirement fund. Any suggestions?
3089 2018-03-27 00:08:09 Asia stocks begin positive as region takes impetus from gains on Wall St, where the majors rebounded with a vengeance from their worst weekly loss in 2 years to post their best day since Aug. 2015 amid easing trade war concerns; ASX 200 (+0.6%), Nikkei 225 (+0.8%), KOSPI (+0.8%)

3091 2018-03-27 00:06:27 9.1% now and the it will keep going up, considering the 2nd slump was because of trade war fears. Now China is saying theyll deal with the tariffs if it means avoiding a trade war. So we won the skirmish and the stocks will go back up most likely
3092 2018-03-27 00:06:05 Bump Stocks Save Lives ... Honestly, well-placed shots would have killed many more in any shooting using a bump stock, and anyone who shoots thinks bump stocks are hilariously useless.
3093 2018-03-27 00:05:55 The state of the Collingwood Football Club is difficult to accept by us masochists that go every week. From a team that made 2 GF in a row & smashing everyone to one pulled apart by a fkn moron who after 7 years still has L plates on and has NFI. Fkn Basket Case laughing stocks.
3094 2018-03-27 00:05:51 That's good - and needed! I'm over here across the pond, holding my breath, with a replicate tiara of optimism on the mantelpiece and stocks of export-grade bourbon at hand.
3095 2018-03-27 00:05:18 Yes just a few individual names that benefit in these up moves however when markets go down everyday stocks also go down so hard to hold winning positions. Volatility is a killer and only special situation stocks can win in this environment.
3096 2018-03-27 00:05:08 It’s almost like they don’t give a damn. As long as millionaires make millions for working really “hard” trading stocks.

3098 2018-03-27 00:03:39 You're welcome to as many muskets with bayonets and blunderbusses as you can carry in your horse drawn wagon.  As I recall, a musket takes about one minute to load a single shot.  Have at it, I have no desire to deprive you of that right. Bump stocks and AR15s aren't mentioned.
3099 2018-03-27 00:03:37 Sorry about that! Penny stocks are non marginable, so you can only use settled cash to purchase them. If you funded your account via ACH then you'll need to wait 3 business days for the funds to clear with your bank. ^TH
3100 2018-03-27 00:02:57 Third best one-day point gain is meaningless when stocks are still underwater for the year.

Do you have any idea how the stock market works?
3101 2018-03-27 00:01:59 Well, 16 and 21 could be interpreted as bans.  16 is the ban on magazines of over ten round capacity.  21 is the ban on bump stocks.  Not many people are against banning devices that effectively make an AR15 fully automatic.  However, 16 would affect nearly all AR15 owners.
3102 2018-03-27 00:01:53 Yeah, it's how he was able to float the special dividend for it's repair.  Great way for us lowly trader types to make a pay check. Agree on the shorting..for stocks. Please don't hate me if I confess that I paid for a vehicle  for my disabled aunt by shorting the oil market. 
3103 2018-03-27 00:01:48 Agree stocks way overvalued, there are a few stocks that are gems, but cryptos are almost all undervalued. About 100 are dead forever and the rest are pretty much undervalued at this point which is great
3104 2018-03-27 00:01:23 Hey guys how long does it take to transfer coins from the stocks exchange to the MAC wallet-  it’s been about an hour-  I sent 100 coins  to test first.  They haven’t arrived
3105 2018-03-27 00:01:04 I just can’t waste energy on people who think bump stocks - high capacity magazines - are ok - and waiting periods and background checks are wrong.
3106 2018-03-27 00:00:38 The problem with synchronized global growthFor many equity analysts, the ebb-and-flow of stocks is seen from their daily price movements. Below that is a deeper earnings estimate revision battle shifting the deeper trading currents between bulls and bear...
