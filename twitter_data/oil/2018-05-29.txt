42 2018-05-29 23:57:39 Since Trudeau intends to do away with steel, in Canada where is he planning to buy it from? You sure did not defend our workers or our industry in oil and gas sector did you? So stop the BS! Canadians are not stupid.

49 2018-05-29 23:57:20 There's a Roman cookbook dated to the first century AD that calls for a flatbread to be topped with chicken, garlic, pepper, and olive oil and cooked and it sounds tasty.
50 2018-05-29 23:57:20 One thing is certain and that’s the Fed’s own the pipeline not Alberta Oil!

52 2018-05-29 23:57:16 I'm Italian, and I can't stand olives. It's my greatest shame. (I love olive oil, though.)
53 2018-05-29 23:57:15 I am not a big environmentalist like @Surfcrest but to me a pragmatic solution is for Alberta or the Fed to indemnifies BC against any liabilities from a spill, to negotiate a secure quota of gas for BC, and to set aside a portion of oil fund specifically for renewables.

59 2018-05-29 23:56:47 If we didn’t have investment in natural resources where would our revenues come from? I understand the need to reduce our dependency on oil & gas. That will take time. Our society will never allow govt to turn off the taps to run our cars, make products that we demand to have

63 2018-05-29 23:56:21 I’m the most pro oil guy on the planet, but now more than ever, I hope his pipeline never gets built. I did not pay taxes to buy a pipeline. I do that as a shareholder of KM. I pay taxes for education, courts, border security. Today the government failed big time.
64 2018-05-29 23:56:20 As a new part-owner of an oil pipeline, I fully expect the "Anyone but Harper" Liberals to get behind the @OntarioNDP this time around. If not, we very well may be looking at a vote-splitting win for the Doug Ford Conservatives. #TransMountainPipeline #OntarioVotes

76 2018-05-29 23:55:08 Well maybe tories should have done something for their oil corporation welfare when they had a chance!
77 2018-05-29 23:54:58 @foodwishes Greetings.  Could you please settle a dispute.  I say that oil isn't needed in pasta water, others say do. I say don't rinse pasta after cooking,  others say do. Who's right?  Thanks!

79 2018-05-29 23:54:42 We HAVE to export our muck - at a loss. Maybe if we refined it here it might have more value. The pipeline won't change that, or increase sales. China wants its oil.

81 2018-05-29 23:54:29 La 2 preciosa no t rasures hasta no star contigo
82 2018-05-29 23:54:25 Economics for Alberta bitumen don't work. Costly to refine, & no VOOC port. Really, just what is the hurry to get the oil out? Back off production, control the supply, and sell for the long game.
83 2018-05-29 23:54:12 @ChefSupport_GR  I was curious I how do I avoid spatter when cooking with hot oil to avoid injury or big mess
84 2018-05-29 23:53:59 Stupid...the amount of THC in the oil is negligible at best. C'mon NCAA don't you have bigger issues to tackle?

102 2018-05-29 23:52:10 my conclusion is that Merkel and Macron are biggest sponsor of terrorism, also remember that those 2 support iranian terrorism because they pay for oil and gas
103 2018-05-29 23:52:02 It's not looking good around here now at all. I am not sure if the local economy was ever really as strong as we were led to believe it was. I think a lot of people got carried away with the illusion of an oil boom, and now reality has finally set in.

119 2018-05-29 23:50:44 And the answer
120 2018-05-29 23:50:42 Venezuela never stopped resource exploitation instead they made oil 98% of GDP and destroyed the rest of the private sector. I believe the government should fix our broken regulations and sell back the pipeline to the private sector it will be in better hands.

131 2018-05-29 23:49:10 That'll have a strong return investment though, on top of creating tons of jobs for Alberta and BC we'll be able to start getting our oil to international markets. Yes, it's not great to put down such a huge investment on non renewable energy but it's really our only export lol
132 2018-05-29 23:49:09 Do you mean Fossil Fuel consumers? They will have choices, likely cheaper in the future.  Wind and Solar are already cheaper than coal and Natural Gas for energy.  Taxpayers pay Trillions to support the Oil Industry.  The Iraq war has cost on the order of $5.6 Trillion dollars.

162 2018-05-29 23:46:16 I made the mistake of buying tuna that was in vegetable oil instead of water...
163 2018-05-29 23:46:10 it is so fucking pervasive and poisons everything. people stay so fucking ass backwards and end up holding everyone who didn't buy into the snake oil, back. so frustratingly annoying jfc LET IT GO, PEOPLE. BE. FREE.
164 2018-05-29 23:46:00 Where is his military?  We don't need the oil, so let's get out of there.  They need to promote peace in their own back yard.  Not have the US do it from 1/2 a world away.

166 2018-05-29 23:45:58 Get the oil out while we can and can still make money. It won't be long until there is no profitable market for it.

174 2018-05-29 23:44:58 #TransMountainPipeline This has nothing to do with well being of Canadians, the environ, the economy of the poor & mid class. It's about selling the oil, profits that don't go in any of our pockets outside the industry, benifits the crooks that run this pathetic excuse for a gov!

177 2018-05-29 23:44:32 Alberta is booming again thanks to NDP. Conservatives squandered hundreds of billions of dollars. Norways indee an NDP like Government save 1 trillion  dollars with their oil.
178 2018-05-29 23:44:13 I just love how people get upset or confused when their cars have problems when they don’t take care of them at all. Like you have to change your oil regularly, rotate your tires, check your fluids frequently. It isn’t the car most of the time, it’s the operator.

183 2018-05-29 23:43:51 Give me an F***ing break. Coal, oil, natural gas & hydro are heavily subsidized in the US. Stop with the scam.

187 2018-05-29 23:43:06 Isn't nationalizing the oil industry the very thing that made Alberta so pissy in the first place?

189 2018-05-29 23:43:04 At B.C Nations, I would be fully aware that, seen as denying 57 million and change a day in oil revenue before overhead costs, would most likely cost someone, You could blame John Horgan, but he is doing this at your request, like putting you in front of a train and saying wait..

192 2018-05-29 23:42:41 Yea cause Oil patch workers are usually a level headed, informed bunch..
193 2018-05-29 23:42:25 Is this a misstep or a plan?
What would this government have to do for the oil industry to be state run or at least state controlled?
194 2018-05-29 23:42:14 Selling oil to China is a very good thing,the people in Canada that want handouts need the $ from somewhere. However there is no reason why #bcpoli doesn't reactivate the 2 closed refineries so we no longer need to pay extra by shipping fuel up the Pudget Sound coast from the US
195 2018-05-29 23:42:01 I use to use tea tree oil but my skin is unbelievably sensitive & it made my acne worse even when diluted  but right now that's sort of the way I've been removing blackheads but not with a toner  does that keep it from getting irritated?

Patient: “I don’t drive.”

202 2018-05-29 23:41:02 Have you got family and/or friends around you who can give you support until your assessment comes through.  Or can chase the appointments if you don't feel up to it. Unfortunately a lot of the time it is the squeaky wheel who gets the oil so more chasing you can do, the better.
203 2018-05-29 23:40:33 He is doing good stuff in other areas but still until oil can be replaced pipelines are needed until then, can’t replace something that doesn’t exist yet for mass use, I think it could be the design that can change to make it environment friendlier #TransMountainPipeline

214 2018-05-29 23:39:17 by the time the pipeline's built & leaking we'll be on the hook for a lot more than its construction costs. deepwater horizon oil spill cost over $60 billion USD and wasn't cleaned up. there's no economic, scientific or social license argument for building #TransMountainPipeline
215 2018-05-29 23:39:12 Nope not for me either. In fact they got semi better, but the downside was hell with stomach ache all the time.

Soooo. I've got the natural route. Vitamins, minerals, and lavender oil.
I still have ups and downs, but so far so good.
216 2018-05-29 23:39:11 @MeghanMcCain I hope your dad has at least gave Rick Simpson Oil a try,they gave him a death sentence and he's still living today...it also helps for pain its shrunken my lymphoma tumour in 3 months
217 2018-05-29 23:39:02 Wow this is Kinder Morgan x 68. The world has got to agree. No more oil drilling and pipelines.
218 2018-05-29 23:38:50 Today, Trudeau said big oil and big business are more important than the  Indigenous, veterans, disabled, sick, poor, asylum seekers and other disenfranchised people. He is happy with this choice and will tell you it's in your best interest. #KinderMorgan

226 2018-05-29 23:38:05 it was all ready to go before our various governments decided they didn't want to have anything to do with Alberta oil. This pipeline will never be built and Canadians will saddled with more debt. JT has said he wants to end to Canada oil.

234 2018-05-29 23:36:41 Probably be weeks before it filters thru. When oil price goes up it kicks in instantly.

245 2018-05-29 23:36:18 You’re saying a 120L spill of hydraulic fluid into Nanaimo bay is ok but 100L spill of oil on dry land is bad?  Therefore, we should keep ferry workers employed but deny jobs to indigenous peoples who plan to help build and operate the pipeline?

256 2018-05-29 23:34:55 Ask Norway. State run oil makes them a powerhouse. They don’t have to bend over for oil companies and piss away royalties. If managed properly it would be a much better option.

259 2018-05-29 23:34:24 no need for xanax! Take CBD oil instead

272 2018-05-29 23:32:26 People are hypocrites. While I wish it were not so, we cannot live in a world right now without oil. All of us rely upon oil (cars, trucks, trains, food/goods transportation, heating, plastics contain oil etc). The oil needs to get to market. Best way is pipeline.
273 2018-05-29 23:32:24 1. Use a clay masque to extract oil from pores.
2. Scrub/lather regularly w/ a bamboo activated charcoal soap/scrub.
Rinse.
3. Take a folic acid supplement regularly, they're cheap.
4. When acne is present, use sanitized steel loops to nip the head & extract the goo. Wash/rinse.
274 2018-05-29 23:32:20 This gives both Trudeau and Notley free reign to carbon tax our asses off, which is what they were after in the first place. That and to chase off any investment in future oil plays. 
I think they are too stupid to realize that they can be voted out.
275 2018-05-29 23:32:18 @Lazin_Ryder good job so far on today's OTC. Can you get a guest to talk about how difficult or easy it would be to clean up an oil spill of bilbit. I understand that it floats on top of water for a couple of weeks before it starts to sink. Are there new technologies?

Some soldiers do Good, others don't. I can think of many paid & volunteer jobs more worthy of automatic honor.

282 2018-05-29 23:31:35 But the fact is,i masok uitm without using cable. Got in via UPU,graduated with good results. My first job was in an international big 4 accounting firm,and then i went to a fortune 500 oil & gas co,and then now i work in an australian property company
283 2018-05-29 23:31:32 And yet they never got off the oil company teet. That’s why nobody respects them. Proof in the fact you can buy as many Bolts as you want today, but still can’t sell as many as the model 3. Sorry pal!
284 2018-05-29 23:31:24 Since your combo you can use moisturizers with oil in them but I prefer oil free if you’re trying to reduce break outs. And DEFINITELY use a toner. My favorite is the rose petal witch hazel from Thayers, you can get it at target and it comes in lavender too!
285 2018-05-29 23:31:24 Maybe it’s not a bad use of my tax money. After all, private companies were willing to invest so why not us? On the other hand, is the CPC ready to renounce all government “investment” in the oil industry (i.e. no more subsidies)?
286 2018-05-29 23:31:21 Sorry we missed you guys. Maybe next time we can get ya at the at the Oil Patch Cafe.
287 2018-05-29 23:31:09 Didn’t get my oil changed today but I did manage to dismount and box up my tv and my little Blu-ray player too. My living room already looks weird without it. Can’t imagine how it’s going to look in here come Thursday after the movers come

296 2018-05-29 23:29:57 You could actually control your anxiety! I would suggest trying cbd oil, breathing excercises, frequent naps & meditation
297 2018-05-29 23:29:53 put too much oil in my car  
298 2018-05-29 23:29:46 And then not let the oil flow through the pipeline when kenney repeals the carbon tax.

301 2018-05-29 23:29:17 If oil, coal and gas are all alternative, what is primary?
302 2018-05-29 23:29:06 If we are the proud new owners of the TMX pipeline it had better be the best damn pipeline ever built and had definitely the highest yields of oil transport this country had ever seen. I only invest in quality corporations and investments
303 2018-05-29 23:28:46 Do u think Gold will make a move to the downside like oil? Do u have a 1309 sell order at your T level? Or?  Looking forward to the gold update.
304 2018-05-29 23:28:40 So oil gas and coal aren’t subsidized?
You REALLY wanna go down this road?.....

307 2018-05-29 23:28:15 have you tried cbd oil before?
308 2018-05-29 23:28:14 I need of some new oil pastels and watercolor crayons mine are starting to look like cockroaches
309 2018-05-29 23:28:08 In coconut oil we trust
310 2018-05-29 23:28:03 Yes and it's probably leaking oil...look at the grass, it's not green! It's probably leaking into the water system as well and over time will begin to effect the wild life and air. This is what happens when our CANADIAN Government allows US Corporations to do whatever they please

317 2018-05-29 23:27:03 Good evening! Did you mix it with a particular carrier oil?
318 2018-05-29 23:26:55 Yet you’re ok with BC having the largest coal distribution facility on the pacific... all of the US pacific states have banned the export of coal due to its environmental impact. BC said no problems rail it up to us and we will ship it out for you... oil burns cleaner than coal.
319 2018-05-29 23:26:51 I'd hit it until I was worn down stubbier than a British Judge Approved Kitchen Knife
320 2018-05-29 23:26:51 instead of smoking a bowl at 4:20 I ate a bowl of roasted veggies and wild brown rice with a weed infused olive oil drizzle, is this what being an adult is?
321 2018-05-29 23:26:40 Are you not aware that coal and oil have been subsidized?
322 2018-05-29 23:26:38 The word Moshiach refers to being anointed (Limshicho) with holy anointment oil, not, to saving from sins as false missionaries try claim.

326 2018-05-29 23:26:00 So the Indiginous Leaders are experts? Really? I see snowmobiles, new trucks, atv's, riverboats, jetboats, rebuilds if homes an school's very often on the Indiginous lands. How does that make them experts? I see very much more usage of oil products there than most neighborhoods
327 2018-05-29 23:25:59 It is liberal privilege and I'm sick of it!
328 2018-05-29 23:25:58 Q: What are Trump, China and Venezuela? 

A: The three main reasons why oil is trading near $80/b #Jeopardy #populism #nationalism #socialism
329 2018-05-29 23:25:55 The good news is that now @JustinTrudeau and @RachelNotley own the pipeline, it will never get built because they prove time and time again that the feds and Alberta can’t get things done. They could have buy a refinery and keep 100% of the oil royalties... bad economics
330 2018-05-29 23:25:53 "was"?
331 2018-05-29 23:25:35 Last night's action, easy read, plunge and more plunges. 
#OIl and #Gold the few that made gains to the #USD.
Risk #currencies hammered to the $USD and $JPY
#Stocks sold off, #GER30 tanked losing 286 pts. #US30 -370 pts

332 2018-05-29 23:25:23 Though oil shipping has made it hard to transport grain etc... I am sure they will be fine.
333 2018-05-29 23:25:21 Your MCM can't even change his oil. He goes to maintenance and spends his last $50.
334 2018-05-29 23:25:07 Today’s crude oil is 76 per barrel
335 2018-05-29 23:25:04 A BIG AMEN to that from me, as well!
336 2018-05-29 23:24:49 Meili: Why in, a time of economic downturn, have you chosen to put a (PST) tax (increase) in a place to slowdown economic activity?
What were you thinking?

Moe: #skpoli people told him price of barrel of oil shouldn't dictate number of nurses hired, education $ spent.
337 2018-05-29 23:24:45 My bio silk oil was just dripping on the damn sink all day. 13 dollars gone down the drain literally 
338 2018-05-29 23:24:40 You know you are a Democrat if you believe non-existent big oil money corrupts skeptics, by billions of dollars of government funding doesn't corrupt academics.  @NaomiOreskes
339 2018-05-29 23:24:36 All over the world energy resources are considered a national strategic asset. Until Obama the US could not even export it. On the east coast we are required to import oil from regimes with poor human rights. The cobalt to make batteries comes from child labor. I prefer Canada.
340 2018-05-29 23:24:30 Socialize the risk and privatize the reward. Typical neoliberalism. We should bloody well build it as a nation and keep the profits. Canadian tax payers have subsidized big oil long enough. It’s time for us to reap the rewards.
341 2018-05-29 23:24:16 Not as bad but my last car took for oil change they didn't tighten drain plug blew the motor still pissed

344 2018-05-29 23:23:56 Looking at many veg/seed oil/fats charts via Google search, there is little attribution and very few dates, so it is difficult to determine the w/w/w/w/h of the information... Recent info would be helpful...
345 2018-05-29 23:23:45 He never said she had to talk
346 2018-05-29 23:23:39 What? No oil wells? Think big, man!
347 2018-05-29 23:23:29 Sad to say, but to him they look bad because they're not high enough to make money for his oil buddies...
348 2018-05-29 23:23:29 I feel it! Coconut oil made me break out so much! Tree tea oil is what I use, and I dilute it with a lot of water too! Works nice to get rid of stray pimples overnight.
349 2018-05-29 23:23:22 Right? $950 million for the supercluster innovation funds. $4.5 billion for an oil pipeline. Our priorities are pretty clear.

352 2018-05-29 23:22:50 Thanks that looks good Ima try it
353 2018-05-29 23:22:50 What they "don't tell you" is that it is going to be SOLD TO ASIA and NOT used by the U.S. one bit. 

Which makes the Opportunity Cost look, well, frightening if the ANWR is ruined. We don't need to use it yet. If WE ran out of an oil supply, ok, use it.
354 2018-05-29 23:22:44 I used to work for a few oil giants in Houston and I know about the longstanding desire to screw up the wilderness. It's not worth it because we have many other technologies we can rely on that doesn't require petrol to run.
355 2018-05-29 23:22:34 Tea tree oil boo boo
356 2018-05-29 23:22:27 Still won’t fucking get built trudeau apologized for not killing the Western oil industry quickly to the French remember! How’s it going to look for his UN ambitions if he builds a fucking pipeline?
357 2018-05-29 23:22:20 There's a lot more to oil than ICE automobiles.  Our dilbit is rich in petrochemicals and diesel.  Jag will shut it down when he's PM.  Compensation to $KML would have been higher than what we're paying for it, at least we own it now.  #Trudeausfault

361 2018-05-29 23:21:48 1 tablespoon of garlic. Salt pepper to taste 1 tablespoon of onion powder. Coat pork chops with this mixture. Heat olive oil in skillet. When oil is hot brown both sides of the chops then deglaze skillet with dry white cooking wine lower heat and simmer

364 2018-05-29 23:21:33 As a general rule, richer countries have higher prices while poorer countries and the countries that produce and export oil have significantly lower prices. One notable exception is the U.S. which is an economically advanced country but has low gas prices.

376 2018-05-29 23:20:50 When I go get oil changes I expect them to see if it’s anything wrong with my car but I don’t that’s for information purposes tho...don’t fix shit extra
377 2018-05-29 23:20:27 Comparing hydraulic fluid to crude oil begs the "apples v. oranges" question.
Considering the array of people who oppose the pipeline – Indigenous groups, environmentalists, tourism advocates, BC locals, etc. – it's safe to say that the potential dangers outweigh any positives.
378 2018-05-29 23:20:25 Comprei um xampu da Keune Oil Control (75 dilmas). Usei 3x no Rio, ficou uma maravilha. Eu: amei esse xampu holandês. Chegou em Manaus o efeito foi o reverso. Tanto ódio.
379 2018-05-29 23:20:21 Try CBD oil. The stronger stuff (pure indica, nothing with a head high because the heady stuff, aside from being nasty anyway, is purely recreational) will undo the twists the central twist has worked in. I use it for my dystonia
380 2018-05-29 23:20:17 Cbd oil bath?! Enlighten me!!
381 2018-05-29 23:20:10 So.... Some guy I know who is employed by big oil just sent me a video on FB messenger in regards to pipelines and I'm trying to think of a polite way to be like, "fuck you, not today".

386 2018-05-29 23:19:13 But they create more jobs, plus more spinoff jobs than the oil pipeline, which most of the jobs are a one time deal! Work today, laid off tomorrow, take your pick!
387 2018-05-29 23:19:01 Poloz actually said he was worried about Toronto and Vancouver prices, but oil was a higher priority to prevent a recession.

392 2018-05-29 23:18:32 Lol.  This man said FN were a priority and has done next to nothing and has made things worse in some communities.  He cared when it meant votes.  He’s counted oil workers and campaign funding and made his choice. Sucked me in last time.  Not again.

408 2018-05-29 23:16:33 We need out of the box thinking; not a simple oil pipeline.
We should repurpose the pipeline into a high speed water slide every weekend in the summer.
Alberta gets a pipeline
Environmentalists get a low carbon alternative to air travel
BC gets more tourism jobs

410 2018-05-29 23:16:20 A) that sounds pretty lewd all by itself B) don’t worry if it’s rusty, it just needs to be re-seasoned. Rub oil all over it and bake in oven at 400 for an hour or so. Also somewhat lewd?
411 2018-05-29 23:16:19 S/o to the guys at @jiffylube for helping get the dipstick unstuck and the oil change in under 20 minutes
412 2018-05-29 23:16:08 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, or American citizens.
413 2018-05-29 23:16:03 Great News! Soon we will rake in the money for Years to come. Better our oil than everyone else's.  Do the right thing Elizabeth and find something else to protest against. Ban all plastics that we could live without and i would back you 100%

425 2018-05-29 23:15:07 I’m going to lube my timeline with Virgin Coconut Oil, just in case anyone feels like sliding into my DMs
426 2018-05-29 23:15:00 Having to get an oil change is so annoying
427 2018-05-29 23:14:59 Thank you.
428 2018-05-29 23:14:58 The pipeline will be carrying oil by 2030? Maybe?
429 2018-05-29 23:14:48 LOLOLOL 
430 2018-05-29 23:14:42 WIll you have oil with that water?

432 2018-05-29 23:14:35 Peel, boil for 5-10 mins, drain, toss in oil, place into a hot oil/duck fat baking dish at 220C until crispy (45-60min)
433 2018-05-29 23:14:14 @meathead tried the corn oil injection method from your site on a Turkey this weekend. It was outstanding. 
434 2018-05-29 23:14:13 No you'd have to say "I'd hit it".
435 2018-05-29 23:14:12 I think it’s that clear goldish stuff that looks like fresh motor oil
436 2018-05-29 23:13:53 My oil change reminder came on & I don’t wanna 
437 2018-05-29 23:13:50 Nutella is chocolate and palm oil. I fail to detect the hype.
438 2018-05-29 23:13:48 @luykus fuck you snowflake America runs in oil!
439 2018-05-29 23:13:46 It's decades past time that #Alberta turned off the oil valves to everyone including the rest of #Canada and built our own finishing facilities instead of pimping our raw resources. Build them and keep the REAL money here in AB where it belongs. AND Screw the transfer payments!
440 2018-05-29 23:13:35 And then, can you believe it??? Obama, before he left the White House, painted all of the walls with olive oil so when I keep throwing sh#t, nothing sticks!!!

445 2018-05-29 23:13:11 science says life begins at conception. Not the Bible..science. Do with that what you will, but don’t claim it’s opportunistic snake oil to believe the termination of that life is killing. If protecting life is a dying culture, then perhaps one should examine its replacement
446 2018-05-29 23:13:07 Don't share such info just like that. 2013 Brent crude oil was at 110 $ a barrel. That automatically will justify the 82 Rs price at that time.

Today's crude oil price is under 60$.

448 2018-05-29 23:12:26 Prices are up because Trump cancelled the Iran nuclear deal. Domestic oil production actually went up under Obama and prices fell. You are a fountain of misinformation and generalizations.

455 2018-05-29 23:11:54 They should go to a Turkish shop and ask the shop owner to pronounce "hibiscus tea" and then drink some, and then go to an Indian shop and buy hibiscus hair oil and ask the shop owner to say that too. Then ask a bookseller in Lagos to pronounce "Purple Hibiscus." #Dream :)
456 2018-05-29 23:11:50 Oil change, detailed and washed all in the same day feel like I’m driving a new whip
457 2018-05-29 23:11:48 The argument that building pipeline capacity will mean higher prices for Alberta's bitumen is nonsensical   increased supply means a bigger market glut thus lower prices Cheaper fracked US oil will still be a drag on prices plus transportation costs to Asia also impacts price
458 2018-05-29 23:11:42 He oil me down... and fuck me like a pornstar 
459 2018-05-29 23:11:41 Grain can’t move by rail, #liberals introduce bill #c49. Oil pipeline can’t be built, liberals buy #kindermorganpipeline. Government shouldn’t be in the pipeline business.  @JustinTrudeau #LiberalLogic @taxpayerDOTcom
460 2018-05-29 23:11:38 He is just a liar, a snake oil merchant like Morrison #conmancormann
461 2018-05-29 23:11:33 This will easily cost the taxpayers 18 billion dollars or more. People don't seem to understand that today's 4.5 billion is for the 50 year old pipeline already moving oil. The extension is about 7 billion, but under this gov, double that, maybe more. 4.5 + 14 = 18.5 billion.

465 2018-05-29 23:11:08 What is it with Socialists and nationalizing oil projects?
466 2018-05-29 23:11:07 So our new car is completely non-operational and now Dan is in the driveway fixing his car because it’s leaking oil. When does it end?!
467 2018-05-29 23:11:06 I prefer Dennis "Oil Can" Boyd as a nickname.

475 2018-05-29 23:10:19 To be fair, if they hadn’t centralized their economy into only/mainly their oil sector, and instead had diversified , things would be a lot better by now.
476 2018-05-29 23:10:15 @0hlakay when u started doing oil changes ?
477 2018-05-29 23:10:15 It makes perfect sense. The govts are working for US and foreign oil and do not want Canada to become oil independent.
478 2018-05-29 23:10:09 @CKNW 
So now we make legislation to limit the amount of oil coming from Alberta for export..back to you Ms Notley ;-)
479 2018-05-29 23:10:08 Ok Paul, so what? There is a lot more to do besides the tax cuts - that ancient history. Besides, as it turns out, at least for middle class, upper and lower, there really that big of a deal. Especially since oil prices are driving gas prices up. 

So, what's next????????????????
480 2018-05-29 23:09:58 It all makes sense now. Next campaign will be Trudeau vs Kenney. No carbon tax = no oil flowing out of Alberta/Canada. Cdns need to vote Lib to demand AB carbon tax and international oil sales. #divideandconquer

498 2018-05-29 23:08:39 gas averaged well under $2 under Bush, so even with family ties to oil, bush did not pander to the oil industry, barack tenure is quite different, never got below $2 and went to over $4, so what are you squawking about, did you squawk at barack? probs not
499 2018-05-29 23:08:38 The Oil industry in Albertahas traditionally built its major projects and infrastucture during low commodity price cycles to capitalize on high price cycles. Since the Libs and NDP.... Slowest since Turdeau 1.0

518 2018-05-29 23:07:01 Or to be correct, you should not. But the Canadian Government seems to want to bailout the declining oil industry.
519 2018-05-29 23:06:55 Theres no nuance here - but it's incredible to me that people spanning generations and classes and backgrounds can grow up consuming media of all sorts (books, TV, movies) where the evil banker or oil baron hoardes the money and is seen as immoral and consistently learn nothing.

548 2018-05-29 23:02:56 We'll buy the 1953 pipeline infrastructure (4.5 billion) , pay for building the expansion ( 7 plus billion), and just as it's ready to make some money, sell the whole thing to a huge oil company for pennies on the dollar, citing "jobs" as an excuse.
549 2018-05-29 23:02:47 right because that has nothing to do with the economic downturn in the oil industry and the overall lack of investment during Herr Harper's reign of "action plans"
550 2018-05-29 23:02:38 So is it possible that there are strategic military concerns that aren’t being brought up for whatever reason that might make it in our national interest? Nightmare scenario: we leave the oil in the ground and someone tries to come and get it?

Let that sink in.
586 2018-05-29 23:00:11 Comparing it to the long range Model3, the Mirai is heavier, slower, has a smaller range and is ~$20k more expensive.

Refuelling... where you can, is 4x more expensive:
$15/kg = 22.5c/mile
$0.20kWh = 5.3c/mile

Where does the H2 come from? Oil.

597 2018-05-29 22:59:20 I follow you and vote for you. Please back off criticizing the current government for supporting and buying the project -which will ensure it gets built. I work for this project, support the temporary use of funds to secure it (just like the oil sands had back when they started).
598 2018-05-29 22:59:03 Ok so couple of questions as I seem to be missing somthing,:
1 how much do we burn in fossil fuels trucking and train freight oil per year?
2how many trucks/trains would this pull off the road?and how much in energy would that save a year?

601 2018-05-29 22:58:46 Venezuela took over Gold mines and the from Oil companies there from investors. Canada's @JustinTrudeau is taking over Kinder Morgan pipelines. 
A pattern?
602 2018-05-29 22:58:44 could all of this have something to do with the fact that Iran is selling oil in non-U.S currencies?
603 2018-05-29 22:58:42 Pipelines in Alberta were responsible for 28,666 oil spills, an average of nearly 775 per year or two oil spills a day for 37 years. #Fact

613 2018-05-29 22:57:29 As much as I think oil pipelines are evil, there are first nations tribes in BC who support it being built, so I think its disingenuous to say all natives oppose it.
614 2018-05-29 22:57:26 It's twinning an existing pipeline (which they're also buying if I understand it right) and will terminate at the same oil terminals already in Vancouver (Port Moody/Ioco).  Spill risks are already there, it's just a question of increase in volume. It sounds manageable, anyway

You're a snake oil salesman and an actual insult to those people.

Get out of the fucking way.
624 2018-05-29 22:56:13 Just trying to understand how oil is going to collapse, and cause climate catastrophe at the same time? How will tanker traffic increase tenfold while demand supposedly disappears? which is it? The arguments are as flimsy as the BC government.

633 2018-05-29 22:55:29 But who decides which oil spill is cleaned, and how, and on what timeline, and who the workers will be, and their protections? The state. Graeber’s critique is super salient here though—we assume that the state shares our individual interests. But we live in racist oligarchy.

635 2018-05-29 22:55:21 Do you part by endorsing the OFF Fossil Fuels Act. It's time to clean up your energy & environment policies. NEWSFLASH! You can't ramp up production of fracked oil & gas and say you are an environmentalist or clean renewable energy advocate. #ActonClimate #copolitics
636 2018-05-29 22:55:08 European countries had to 'buy' sterling, d-marks or dollars to exchange for crude oil.

649 2018-05-29 22:53:41 Venezuela is not banned from any oil distribution network. Currently PDVSA has lost several lawsuits against other companies and they're taking its assets. In fact, these lawsuits have taken 10 or more years and the major issue has been the negative of PDVSA to pay any indemnity
650 2018-05-29 22:53:38 I stopped using coconut oil years ago, and I just used it for the first time. Idek why I ever stopped. It works wonders for my hair
651 2018-05-29 22:53:35 Get some sleep first. Then if the info is huge(they actually announce the games) you can burn the midnight oil.

657 2018-05-29 22:52:43 What?

A couple of comments ago, you were calling Pakistanis rapists.

Syria was a civil war that got made worse by ISIS terrorists, nothing to do with UK and US wanting oil.
658 2018-05-29 22:52:40 Disaster who is going to clean up the spill?  Double standards Quebec said no why not BC?  Where is the money from the Vancouver oil spill arriving?  Just splat money everywhere except where it really matters, Trudeau.  Horgan has my respect.
659 2018-05-29 22:52:25 Hence negotiate our own deals for shipment of oil to the rest of Canada and the world.  Land locked doesn’t mean without leverage.
660 2018-05-29 22:52:24 you never tried that?
like, just put some oil in a pan and toss the veggies in it

663 2018-05-29 22:52:15 And that's bad, they should of had guaranteed health protections, but the oil spill still needs to be cleaned up, so I guess I don't understand what the point is? Whether we trust the state or not, we still have to negotiate its presence and its role in the means of production.

682 2018-05-29 22:49:51 What advice did they give you.
Just a few suggestions.
Black charcoal type cleansers are good.  Vicks vapour rub.  Always helped me when I was at the point of exhaustion.
Also you could look up anything on oregano oil. I put a post up a few days ago of some if it's benefits.
683 2018-05-29 22:49:34 before I tweeted that I tried to insta story it but I was too slow but... I had to watch the whole thing play out... it was actual butter. and maybe a 1/3rd of a stick but still; fuck. lol. aren't you supposed to use some mct oil stuff too? I've heard about it but laughed it off
684 2018-05-29 22:49:33 U on a oil rig?
685 2018-05-29 22:49:32 I guess we own a pipeline now, Canada. Since the #TransMountainPipeline is now apparently "nationalized," let's democratize the sonofabitch & make sure that our oil and energy sector is run democratically by Canadians, for Canadians, not for private profits and foreign investors.
686 2018-05-29 22:49:32 Literally totaled my car like two weeks ago been driving around this nice ass 2018 Nissan rental today on my way home I hear something pop and pull over and oil is spewing out everywhere under the car.          F. M. L.

730 2018-05-29 22:45:04 I suggest you look at the situation. If you think you feel nothing for her. There won’t be reason to fall in love for fear or favor. You should just come clean and explain to her that you’ve moved on; there is nothing wrong in that - she would adapt too.
731 2018-05-29 22:44:51 remove or suspend the excise tax in all oil products and everything else will follow

the higher the oil price hike each and everytime

equals higher government tax collection


732 2018-05-29 22:44:47 @jjhorgan YOU ARE ONE FUCKED UP DUDE!!! YOU ARE SO WRONG! you will not stop my pipeline. you will not stop me getting my oil to market. you will not make me live in a slum. you're damn city IS UN-AFFORDABLE TO ME. you will not take money away from me anymore!
733 2018-05-29 22:44:37 Your party's policies literally almost broke Alberta because of one oil recession. There was no thought to the future, whatsoever, and you left Alberta completely vulnerable.
734 2018-05-29 22:44:37 Weed oil melted in my car
735 2018-05-29 22:44:26 Incomplete story.  The federal government (read taxpayers) bought the 65 year old existing pipeline and the oil tanker terminal in Burnaby for $4.5 billion.  Then, on top of that taxpayers will spend another $7.6 billion (est) to twin the pipeline.  Total cost at least $12 bil.
736 2018-05-29 22:44:21 So #cdnpoli 

Did anyone see this as the *intended* outcome?

First was the maligning of oil. Then Notley and Horgan went at each other. Then the "deadline" came.

IMHO this was all a play to nationalize the #TransMountainPipeline.

And they all got their wish.

Thoughts?

748 2018-05-29 22:43:10 You do realize bc doesnt get its oil and gas from alberta right? We get it shipped in from US refineries. The pipeline has nothing to do with gas costs in BC.
749 2018-05-29 22:43:06 Pipelines in Alberta were responsible for 28,666 oil spills, an average of nearly 775 per year or two oil spills every day for 37 years.

751 2018-05-29 22:43:05 try steaming your face with an oil that’s safe for your skin. you can run a towel under hot water then apply to your fave to open up your pores. castor oil, almond oil, grape seed oil are good & wont clog your pores
752 2018-05-29 22:42:59 @illuminent Hi, I just received a 5mm bottle of blueberry kush vape oil. The bottle is mostly empty. Is this normal?
753 2018-05-29 22:42:57 Erin Grey
754 2018-05-29 22:42:47 You can only hang on to the past for so long.  Oil and gas the way we know it are on its way out.    Trump gave it an extension but you can't fight what direction the world is moving.
755 2018-05-29 22:42:45 All these people on here complaining - are you all using solar panels? Do you put gas in your cars. There are about 50+ household products made with oil. Asphalt on highways, etc. When you stop using these products, then you have the right to complain.

Tapi klau x de rezeki,, sambung degree,, but maybe not in mechnical engineering automotive anymore.. Pecah pale mat nak buat fyp sorang2 dgn proposal nya lagi.

761 2018-05-29 22:41:58 I feel it! I don’t like mine dry or w the oil so I just eat it like regular saimini. We usually get it from the Asian market tho!
762 2018-05-29 22:41:51 @jhagra Where's PTI's mineral policy ?? No plans on improving Oil & Gas Exploration and Production ?

764 2018-05-29 22:41:47 i’ve started using coconut oil instead of butter so if you see me looking a little bit skinnier tomorrow...you know what’s up
765 2018-05-29 22:41:42 Seems that the Cheam First Nation lives in reality and understands the need for oil.  An ownership stake gives them a voice.
766 2018-05-29 22:41:40 Man they’ve been bullish oil lol. They were also bearish gold this winter when so many calling for 1400.  Context!
767 2018-05-29 22:41:36 I have heard that the oil companies drill and produce oil on public land and in public water with no fee. And then sell it overseas!!! Public land and water belongs to all of us, so whatever is produced on said land or water,  also belongs to all of of!  Where is our cut!
768 2018-05-29 22:41:33 I wanna know why people think oil in a pipe-line is worse that oil in an ocean super tanker, STUPID. Don't tell me fossil fuels are wrong, that, we already know, I'm just saying, if we are moving it, pipe-line is a no brainer, yes ?
769 2018-05-29 22:41:33 Trudeau government doubling down on its support for Canada's oil and gas industry
770 2018-05-29 22:41:28 Rachel's prolly doing splits,  on an oil well
771 2018-05-29 22:41:21 Venezuela stopped efficient resource exploitation and kept up their social programs. Now, they’re starving without a semblance of democracy. There are real consequences to putting the brakes on oil exploration and delivery.
772 2018-05-29 22:41:01 Palm oil is the name of my PhD this week to do a sweep through my website code and weed out errors etc?
773 2018-05-29 22:40:59 "certainty of process"?  in 40 years probably we will be looking at extinction. That will be certain. My guess is that oil will not be a commodity then. 
I hope you have a lot of children and grandchildren and you better enjoy watching them share one piece of bread at night.
774 2018-05-29 22:40:59 Mushroom salad (cut up mushrooms with balsamic vinegar, vegetable oil, and salt), cucumber sandwich (toasted pita with mayo, feta, mushrooms, and cucumber), and cauliflower (steamed cauliflower with lemon juice, vegetable oil, and salt) or dinner. Think I'm getting my veggies?LOL
775 2018-05-29 22:40:58 Do films count? I wrote a letter to Julie Andrews after watching The Sound of Music for the first time.
776 2018-05-29 22:40:54 You know, we have all these really clever, knowledgeable scientists who actually understand this stuff. They're in complete agreement on climate - except for those actually on the oil payroll. But an NG clip on the Euphrates swings it for you. OK.

783 2018-05-29 22:40:01 Got my oil changed now I can head home. Lol I’m tired.
784 2018-05-29 22:40:01 Yes - then a royalty is paid on the oil recovered. It then is owned by the producer. They can blend, refine, export it as they wish.

794 2018-05-29 22:38:55 Alberta has to choose Vicar, as a high cost, high carbon provider, they are first to be sunset.  I suspect Alberta like many oil states will opt for "Thelma and Louise", full speed off the cliff.

834 2018-05-29 22:35:37 I literally only use water and oil in my hair
835 2018-05-29 22:35:29 Money is just an exchange for goods and services. You need to understand the basis for why the money changes hands. That's called economcis. Why does an oil refinery buy 3 futures contracts of oil and sell two gasoline and one Kerosene contract?
836 2018-05-29 22:35:26 @steeletalk I had to pull over.  I am sick. Maybe we can also contract KM to do the construction. When we have THE SPILL Canadians can pay for the clean up too.  Win Win & nary a drop of oil stays in Canada.

843 2018-05-29 22:34:55 That oil will come out of the ground and get shipped via TransMountain (existing) via rail, via Keystone, via proposed Enbridge reversal. Issue is revenue per barrel not necessarily more barrels.
844 2018-05-29 22:34:38 my face have more oil
845 2018-05-29 22:34:26 it’s 2018 and y’all are still putting coconut oil on your faces yikes

847 2018-05-29 22:34:15 Shut your coal shipments down hypocrite! The Indigenous people had 2-3 years to speak out and they did not until the 11th hour. Oil and gas are necessities of life. Cruise ships are not. Get rid of cruise ships for oil tankers! GO OILSANDS!!!!

859 2018-05-29 22:32:31 absolutely! let me know. it’s super easy and involves olive oil!
860 2018-05-29 22:32:23 In most cases your body is producing excess oil because your skin is dry. Try using a light weight oil like coconut after washing your face and your body will adjust its oil production
861 2018-05-29 22:32:23 AYE RIGHT?
Construction, Scotch Whisky, Business Services, Food & Drink, Timber, Hydro Electricity, Wind and Solar Power are just some of the many multi-billion pound industries we have in Scotland. 
Oh, and we have some fish and oil.

WE ARE NOT TOO POOR!!

872 2018-05-29 22:30:40 There is no reason to allow new oil drilling off #California’s coast.  None. Those plans are about greed, not need. That’s why #AB1775 would help stop hazardous drilling by making it too costly for #BigOil. Please urge @AssemblyDems & @AssemblyGOP to vote YES on AB1775

874 2018-05-29 22:30:16 Gave up on the league long time ago, Oilers were the only thing keeping me coming back.  With Oil being a perennial tire-fire, said it was time to move on.  Haven't regretted it since.

884 2018-05-29 22:29:13 It's Port of Vancouver in Washington State (as per US customs data). There's very little dilbit shipped out of Vancouver, BC (about 1 tanker/mo). Rail transport was referenced in another article (didn't link to it). TransMnt pipeline to YVR ships light oil/distillate products.

890 2018-05-29 22:28:42 I had bug crawl in my ear at night, the flying kind, couldn't get out on its own, the flapping was against my ear drum, went to emerge the put oil in to coat it and stop it's breathing and then told me to come back in the morning for the Dr to take it out, I sympathize with her

892 2018-05-29 22:28:32 But Chuck, the oil companies swear they might break even at $50.00 a barrel. And if my aunt had balls, she'd be my uncle...
893 2018-05-29 22:28:27 For the 3rd time in 5 tries @Midas in @TownLexingtonSC has "forgotten" to rotate my tires but didn't forget to charge me. I wonder if they forgot to change the oil too? @CountyLex

921 2018-05-29 22:25:24 Um, no it doesn’t. You obviously don’t know much about California. We have a booming wind and solar industry, not to mention our own oil wells up and down the coast.

But I still can't eat even with the cannabis. We don't have any kind of legalization here in Missouri

I don't support the pipeline expansion, I don't think we should be expanding our oil/gas reliance at ALL,
But I also recognize that Trudeau is government for oil and gas workers as well as those opposed.

939 2018-05-29 22:23:31 I’m so pissed rn. I took my car into meineke for an oil change so they could check my car for an oil leak (or I’d change my own damn oil) and now my car has like no oil and it’s probably done some permanent damage to my engine. Hopefully not
940 2018-05-29 22:23:30 production is set to increase. and the pipeline will ship 3x more oil. 
renewables are not yet ready, but we are not doing nearly enough for the transition. we don't even have a coherent plan to fix the grid.
941 2018-05-29 22:23:28 I wonder what the leak rate and fatality/injury rate is per 100,000L of oil shipped via rail, truck and pipeline? (People get run over by trains and trucks, not by pipelines)
942 2018-05-29 22:23:19 I’d like to check the oil levels on my dragon, but the hood won’t open”

Pulls idly on a claw.
943 2018-05-29 22:23:17 If it's your list Musket I best be on it lol
944 2018-05-29 22:23:16 I can imagine a worse scenario.  Not having a pipeline to get our oil out.  For $124, I'm all for it
945 2018-05-29 22:23:13 I used to use a tea tree oil concentration as spot treatment nightly but didn’t find that it helped me much.
946 2018-05-29 22:23:10 How did you get all that oil up there?
947 2018-05-29 22:22:59 It's a smoothie with Moringa, MCT oil, collagen, bananas, and Spirulina.

I was making fun of us because that was I think the point of Pollan's that stands the test of time: we eat food, not nutrients. I thought you were making a joke about it :)
948 2018-05-29 22:22:56 @Oil_Guns_Merica, obviously. 
949 2018-05-29 22:22:56 It was noted at the CO Oil & Gas Assoc meeting, that they have an astroturf strategy; the need to mobilize on the ground like people have at the COGA end of year legislative session. Dems Sen. Angela Williams & Rep. Paul Rosenthal were panelists that day.

960 2018-05-29 22:22:00 What do you think the oil companies will do if the pipeline is not built? Close their very profitable business or ship their oil by rail? Now which means of transport is safer for oil? Pipeline or rail?
961 2018-05-29 22:21:46 I just called Harold’s, and they fry their meat and fries in the same oil. I’m beyond blown 
962 2018-05-29 22:21:41 Just got some new oil for my hair and I can’t wait to try it 
963 2018-05-29 22:21:35 Today is truly a dark day for the oil and gas industry. A pipeline is being built.
964 2018-05-29 22:21:35 I’m not sure what they used.  Ketocal?  I just looked st the ingredients of it. It looks pretty bad. Soy oil, corn syrup solids. 
965 2018-05-29 22:21:28 One of my favorite shows from the 80's, great theme song too

974 2018-05-29 22:20:56 According to the Consumer Price Index, which measures inflation, this is the highest inflation level since 2012. That was as of March 31. Factor in a spike in oil prices this past quarter and let’s see what it computes to. Nice try.
975 2018-05-29 22:20:51 I know!! That part's amazing, too. I love the bit of Skulls at the end of Tuning Out as well. If I'm not mistaken I think that Way Beyond fades into Oil on Water on WW. I love all of those details - they're so cool.
976 2018-05-29 22:20:39 @EmmaRoseKenney Maybe you can help spread truth about the pineal gland and the crism oil and how we get it to run a full cycle to live our best lives and know who we are.

984 2018-05-29 22:20:00 I’d be down to nationalize the oil and gas sector, but not to expand protection, but to use it to develop the clean energy sector across Canada.

985 2018-05-29 22:19:50 There's still a lot of work that needs to be done, including an oil change, full fluid flush, & likely new tires, but there's no way I can afford all of that until after I take care of all of my upcoming expenses and plans. At least my car can still get me from A to B now, yeah.

1012 2018-05-29 22:17:18 My hair needs a nice hot oil treatment next week.
1013 2018-05-29 22:17:18 The fact that they have for that long and will continue to do so is why and how? Has to be related to saudi oil and arms deals and one caveat of this deal is to turn a blind eye on many things. And what else is going on?
1014 2018-05-29 22:17:06 @JustinTrudeau should be forced to eat every creature killed by oil spills.
1015 2018-05-29 22:16:57 Seriously... how hot was she?!
1016 2018-05-29 22:16:56 I need to get me some  oil

1018 2018-05-29 22:16:38 My scalp itchy too! I just wanna slap some coconut oil on it real quick. I need one of those small applicator bottles
1019 2018-05-29 22:16:37 A diluted bitumen spill resulting from an oil tanker collision or malfunction could have devastating impacts on the biodiversity of the Salish Sea, as well as harm the liveability and economic well-being of island communities. 2/3 #TransMountainPipeline
1020 2018-05-29 22:16:35 Folatil oil dlm jahe sudah sejak dulu tbukti bisa mngatasi problem penyumbatan hidung dan sesak nafas
1021 2018-05-29 22:16:33 I'd have bought a house where I currently live but the oil glut scared me out of it. Not the prices, obv, but the job stability.
Plenty of reason to believe Canada's in the middle of a housing bubble, I don't need a $400,000 mortgage that's suddenly worth $200,000
1022 2018-05-29 22:16:32 Has anyone tried growing out their eyebrows by using castor oil? 
1023 2018-05-29 22:16:30 Hue lights, oil diffuser, PS2,

all nice in my room. and all controlled by my voice
1024 2018-05-29 22:16:28 I had a dog who was gun shy and used to get terrible anxiety even at home when the shoot was on, we used lavender essential oil and it really helped
1025 2018-05-29 22:16:27 So we are on track to be t.f he no. 1 exporter of oil.
1026 2018-05-29 22:16:18 Got new tires and an oil change #feelingaccomplished
1027 2018-05-29 22:16:14 Bro your face so Oily that I could use it as car oil wtf
1028 2018-05-29 22:16:12 Same here. Olive oil does wonders tho.
1029 2018-05-29 22:16:02 I cannot wait until McDavid discovers the power of Oregano Oil ™, gets a pedicure and fashions himself some homemade #jorts while in France.
1030 2018-05-29 22:16:02 I wanna know what wearing make up without feeling like someone threw vegetable oil at my face feels like. I have never met anyone with oily skin like I have. Its the shittiest thing ever.
1031 2018-05-29 22:16:01 you know its summer when the coco oil starts melting 
1032 2018-05-29 22:15:56 Try oil painting
1033 2018-05-29 22:15:54 Really should get an oil change on my car  but they be charging me extra for being a girl i swear! 
1034 2018-05-29 22:15:50 I can relate, I often have to do the same or stay up and go to bed at 4 or 5 am pacific and wake up at 7 or 8 am oil biz is 24/7
1035 2018-05-29 22:15:46 Combine 2 1/2 pints kiwi with 2 cups dairy. Blend with Olive Oil. Chill.  Serve over kale.
1036 2018-05-29 22:15:41 There is a lot to know about your industry. Springs are very complicated. Surprisingly, so are O-rings. They create little rubber 'engines' that push oil through. Weird stuff, fun too.
1037 2018-05-29 22:15:34 I love how you dive well out of your field in chemistry and pragmatic environmentalism to lobby hard for big oil! What’s in it for you Blair! You know my motives! I live here! It’s right by my home where you’re pushing this oil to Asia and oil tanker nonsense for Vancouver!
1038 2018-05-29 22:15:21 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
1039 2018-05-29 22:15:19 Yes, Please Do NOT give his free air time for his Snake Oil rallies 
1040 2018-05-29 22:15:08 Also loveee sweet potatoes and broccoli roasted in olive oil and spices with quinoa. I’m so basic when it comes to my meals
1041 2018-05-29 22:15:04 That was definitely Ace.
1042 2018-05-29 22:14:54 It's a perfectly reasonable Crush.
1043 2018-05-29 22:14:52 I agree with your views on what the oil industry has done for Canada in the past, like how BC once relied on forestry, but oil and gas shouldn't be relied on for future, given the commitments of government and Paris Accord. This is backwards thinking.
1044 2018-05-29 22:14:51 "My top 5 prettiest followers."
1045 2018-05-29 22:14:49 Oh hell.  I thought I was wallowing in this migraine hell alone. I send you good healing wishes. Dark room.  Peppermint oil
1046 2018-05-29 22:14:48 Agreed
1047 2018-05-29 22:14:46 See, that's where you're wrong. Avocados can be made into guacamole, which is acceptable. Olives? Good for nothing. Except olive oil, and even that is questionable.
1048 2018-05-29 22:14:34 The several hundreds of millions that were disarmed and died by the hands of government last century are unavailable for comment. We only have the Ratifiers of our Bill of Rights literature to confirm why the 2A was drafted, THERE'S NO SAFTEY FOR AN UNARMED CITIZENRY.

1051 2018-05-29 22:14:32 Zucchini noodles cookin in olive oil with some spices and cherry tomatoes and garlic + a little bit of pasta sauce is my easy go-to!
1052 2018-05-29 22:14:31 She is right up there with the "Betsy's"
1053 2018-05-29 22:14:31 Higher oil prices is actually what #Trump wants to boost US fracking and shale #oil production. You have a short memory, but last year he actually attacked Saudi and Russia for dumping oil to keep the prices low.
1054 2018-05-29 22:14:27 OH RIGHT! they're rich bastards because of all their oil!! hang in there!! i wish i could send you some chocolate!! but it is just as expensive here...
1055 2018-05-29 22:14:27 if you have french tips on your toes or finger nails I just feel like you need baby oil on them at all times, they give me the porn star vibe 
1056 2018-05-29 22:14:27 Winter we go back to tissue oil and bio oils
1057 2018-05-29 22:14:17 Oil is a safe haven investment coming off major bottoms (2016)
After $USO ran into major resistance last week we've seen a watershed rotation from oil back into LT bonds - for now
1058 2018-05-29 22:13:57 Lol just an oil change and a tire fix 
1059 2018-05-29 22:13:39 Oh Hell yes...
1060 2018-05-29 22:13:24 Note to self: don’t go to @sproutsfm when you’re hungry because you’ll buy all the organic berries, coconut oil, grass fed beef, & cookies...
1061 2018-05-29 22:13:14 I’m going to try the oil then. They started selling it at the local drugstore as well.
1062 2018-05-29 22:13:14 I typically use tea tree oil as an acne spot treatment, but I’m a skin picker, and I find that tea tree oil does make subsequent scars a bit darker 
1063 2018-05-29 22:13:11 You are conflating gun violence with self harm via suicide. Your argument is invalid.
1064 2018-05-29 22:13:10 I’m waiting for my oil change and two girls are jumping on everything and watching home videos on the loudest volume and the mom just goes...girls stop...with no actual care of what they do... this makes me want to yell like “sit the fuck down! This isn’t your house!!” #Thoughts

1066 2018-05-29 22:13:07 TOTALThe French company has a lot of business in the United States and cannot afford to lose its access to the U.S. financial system. So, unless the EU strikes back at Washington and somehow manages to snag a waiver for its largest oil company, Total will be pulling out of Iran.
1067 2018-05-29 22:13:02 Which huntly should have started back in March now we have to use two oil generators to keep the lights on every night hopefully this is a learning curve for next year
1068 2018-05-29 22:12:53 Putin's puppet now. Works for RT
1069 2018-05-29 22:12:52 Well this oil has both campfire and smores what if i combine them my room will smell amazing

EVERYONE NEEDS AN OIL DIFFUSER THIS IS FUN <3
1070 2018-05-29 22:12:37 John Goodman circa early Roseanne days. The reason I chase linebacker looking guys!
1071 2018-05-29 22:12:16 "Isn't it ironic, don't you think". Norway sovereign wealth fund which collects money from offshore oil industry & invests it in stocks & bonds is US$1 trillion (2017) Meanwhile Alberta oil fund is valued C$17.2 billion "Who would've thought, it figures" #bcpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM
1072 2018-05-29 22:12:15 On the opposite end of the spectrum, I had some oil in a frying pan smoke up last week and forgot my security system automatically calls the fire department. My phone was dead so I missed their call and I had 3 trucks and an ambulance show up. Bad adrenaline.
1073 2018-05-29 22:12:11 Yeah, but she was referring to you. 
1074 2018-05-29 22:12:06 Not nearly as much fun as the first.
1075 2018-05-29 22:12:02 Body oil.
Hair oil.
Vegetable oil.
1076 2018-05-29 22:11:59 And Kinder Morgan failed to update their estimates to save face, which is likely at least $9 billion now. The expansion was only viable at $5.4B, when oil prices were still high, and definitely isn't now. The only way would be to increase tolls, which is passed on to BC consumers
1077 2018-05-29 22:11:56 The media leading the blind or misinformed. Do your research on what 100 L means in real life. It was self contained. Perhaps that is not clear. That phone you tweeted on made by products of oil; go to Google and ask for a definition. 0 impact to the environment. Good effort.

1079 2018-05-29 22:11:26 So Arab girls have crude oil in their “poolsea”? Daaammnnn get me an arab girl

1083 2018-05-29 22:10:53 Got some of the recommended coconut oil for the butter coffee.

Verdict?

I don't like coconut flavored coffee.
1084 2018-05-29 22:10:49 Everybody said Trump won. So ladies and gentlemen…. Here is what they all said, a lot of oil. Now, it’s very interesting. Massive plants.
1085 2018-05-29 22:10:42 $ushoteloil change c u soon
1086 2018-05-29 22:10:42 My laws are sexist and I want to oil you bashfully

1092 2018-05-29 22:09:58 In my experience since moving here, Northern Cal is often MORE than HI. Which makes zero sense, as there are refineries and oil fields RIGHT HERE.

1094 2018-05-29 22:09:42 How do you feel about Brian Mulroney's bailout of the offshore oil platform? What about Harper's bailout of GM?
1095 2018-05-29 22:09:13 Bio Oil! I swear by this stuff. Fades my acne scars in like two weeks!
1096 2018-05-29 22:09:07 I don't do drugs I talk to God a lot I pray a lot I work out I read the Bible a lot I don't stress I take care of my skin I drink water I mind/handle mine I stay away from negative ppl I'm blessed The Devil mad but My Spirit Gooder I use olive oil n pray over myself
1097 2018-05-29 22:09:05 When asked what I use on my hair, I'm like "oil, conditioner, maybe some curl stuff-but remember black folks weren't bald before 1900. Keep it clean & nourished."
1098 2018-05-29 22:08:53 so then you can go out in public with your caster oil making your brows thrive and its a look

1102 2018-05-29 22:08:14 Pinterest! Aloe gel, castor oil, and vitamin E!
1103 2018-05-29 22:08:08 Nearly two-thirds of gun deaths are suicide and the US ranks around 43rd for suicides worldwide. Your argument is invalid.

Meant go green

1107 2018-05-29 22:07:17 Canada needs to get the oil to tidewater and pipelines are a whole lot safer then rail .
1108 2018-05-29 22:07:17 Oil and tires
1109 2018-05-29 22:07:14 @VO5Haircare 2 stores told me ur tube  and hot oil are d/c'd (canada). Cant find anywhere!
1110 2018-05-29 22:07:07 Guys, if the definition of adulthood is not: walking into the car dealership joyfully with a $19.99 oil change coupon, only to leave with a $223.28 bill for other necessary services and your soul crushed; then I just don’t even freaking know.
1111 2018-05-29 22:07:06 Yes and vitamin e oil works like a dream.
1112 2018-05-29 22:06:59 Great choice!
1113 2018-05-29 22:06:32 All I want right now is a warm oil full body rub down...
1114 2018-05-29 22:06:31 So if Bill Maher actually gets fired does he disappear from his racist oil painting like Vigo and leave a picture of Twitter leftists behind?
1115 2018-05-29 22:06:22 Any thick curly haired babes who happen to be reading this: 

What do you put in your hair???
I’ve never been a fan of using products (occasionally coconut oil) but this frizz has got to go. I just feel like my curls are a hot mess.
1116 2018-05-29 22:06:21 Take death of an unarmed citizenry by government per capita during the CONCURRENT PERIOD we have had our Bill of Rights. You lack the gravitas to make any arguments since the largest numbers were at the hands of various forms of socialist's. We don't even compare.
1117 2018-05-29 22:06:19 *applies a dab of coconut oil to hair*

Hair stays greasy after 3 washes.
1118 2018-05-29 22:06:17 I believe in argan oil
1119 2018-05-29 22:06:16 In parliament we have a plethora of crooks conmen snake oil salesmen lobbyists, fraudsters & rorters what we don't have are representatives of the people doing the job we pay them for.
All crooks should be outed & the ones taking public money while being crooked most of all
1120 2018-05-29 22:05:54 Geez...even you are not that dumb. Why would you assume anyone is dim enough to buy that line you are selling. Equivalent of snake oil sales.
1121 2018-05-29 22:05:54 I smell like coconut oil
1122 2018-05-29 22:05:51 Let me go check my oil
1123 2018-05-29 22:05:46 It's like saying: " Buy my #oil or I'd shoot myself in the head" 
1124 2018-05-29 22:05:42 Seen the Stock Market lately? ;-) You're magic seems to be wearing off, or was that just snake oil?
1125 2018-05-29 22:05:36 That body oil shimmer shit is the shit i fucks wit it I’m glowing nshit 
1126 2018-05-29 22:05:31 There shouldn't be that much oil in bread! It was soggy!!
1127 2018-05-29 22:05:30 No idea I think it might be the oil/motor but it just fucked up Elijah getting to his new job that he was supposed to start today. I need a new/better car but I’m broke af
1128 2018-05-29 22:05:28 もっと丸いと思ってた…
1129 2018-05-29 22:05:17 An Albertan praising nationalization of oil facilities. Never thought I'd see the day!
1130 2018-05-29 22:05:10 i had a supersize cleanse & polish but ran out now  love it but love a balm the most. haven’t used a decleor cleanser- but i have a mini aromessence oil 
1131 2018-05-29 22:04:50 For the world - emissions will increase equal to extra 2,700,000 million cars every year  and increase  amount of crude oil carried from the current 300,000 barrels per day, to 890,000 barrels per day.
1132 2018-05-29 22:04:49 whatever happened to that oil meme, it was one of the ones that was actually pretty funny. i guess there was only so much it could do though
1133 2018-05-29 22:04:47 Yeah! Just like those Carrier jobs that went to Mexico! All those “clean” coal jobs at all those coal mines that never reopened, but with his tariffs he’s crippling the clean solar industry, helping Russia sell its oil and gas by leaving the Iran deal A great job indeed...
1134 2018-05-29 22:04:44 uh I really can’t stand the smell of oil I feel like gagging so I told her I’d just die
1135 2018-05-29 22:04:42 I love how this pro oil activist justifies selling oil to Asia, by naming off activities that exist in Canada that Asian gasoline has no impact on whatsoever!
1136 2018-05-29 22:04:29 Beauty Tip: If you're using the oil makeup removers, you're probably drying out your skin and eyes with harmful chemicals. I use pure argan oil to remove makeup! It's removes waterproof makeup. Also add a drop into lotions, serums or skincare for glowy skin & moisture!
1137 2018-05-29 22:04:23 Update: ran out of tanning oil and Troy and my brother have convinced me to use olive oil. Send help.
1138 2018-05-29 22:04:22 Replace with regular oil.... and pray over it
1139 2018-05-29 22:04:20 oil street: what??
1140 2018-05-29 22:04:19 Frustrating isn't it, as the non regulated countries & (OPEC supporting terrorist countries) enjoy 70 $ oil Canada sits on the sidelines pissing away huge $ we could be using to make our country more energy efficient, he doesn't give to shits about that anyway, he's a globalist
1141 2018-05-29 22:04:07 yo whipped shea butter dead the easiest thing of all time to do. 
ya get raw shea butter from any beauty supply store, add an oil ( if ya gonna use it on ya face id suggest vitamin e oil ), and use mixer to blend until it's the consistency of like a thick lotion.
1142 2018-05-29 22:04:01 Empathy! I save up and go 4 times a year but i don't have a kid! So i get why you don't because it's like...the epitomy of luxury!

Tkmaxx sells plain bathsalts in bags anf you can add essence oil stuff to make them smell nice!
1143 2018-05-29 22:04:00 WHich oil will he be refining? DOes the North have oil or is it oil from the east? Is this why you can't let Biafrans go?

1146 2018-05-29 22:03:43 I’m in the kitchen cooking. My roommate hears me drop something, from the living room, and looks at me.

Me: nothing broke.
But um. Btw the floor might be slippery in here.

Due to the organic olive oil on it.
1147 2018-05-29 22:03:38 Considering the current political climate and the threats of/from conservatism heading so fucking far right, I'm tempted to grin and bear a pipeline that'll likely stop pumping oil well before it's structural lifespan
1148 2018-05-29 22:02:57 Where others are going to windturbines, we are stuck on oil and Muskrat.  We'll be paying double price for power by 2020. Not pleased at all.

1156 2018-05-29 22:02:31 It is cute but, if you know anything about fish, you never ever throw them back into the water as it bruises them. You never ever handle them with your bare hand. If you have to touch them do so from their belly only. Oil on our hands removes the protective film on a fishes body.
1157 2018-05-29 22:02:23 Water makes fried things soggy. Cook out all the water and they’ll stay crisp even when submerged in oil.
1158 2018-05-29 22:02:20 .@Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
1159 2018-05-29 22:02:17 In this next video, will Varg educate us on the finer points of unlocking the "mystery" of paganism, or will he teach us about how to change an oil filter in a car no one has? Let's find out! Actually, let's not.
1160 2018-05-29 22:02:02 @ithemighty I’m so in love with Oil in Water. What was the inspiration for writing The Lying Eyes of Miss Erray (if you don’t mind me asking)? #socurious
1161 2018-05-29 22:02:01 That would surely be better than the standard enteral formulas. Have you read the ingredients list on them? I worry about the fats/oil used though. Isn't it soy based? It sure isn't olive oil.
1162 2018-05-29 22:01:59 Far from an expert but I’d bet Hemp Oil/CBD has similar benefits. Not speaking from experience.

1164 2018-05-29 22:01:57 Better that than to be held hostage and lose BILLIONS in oil revenue. #TransMountainPipeline
1165 2018-05-29 22:01:56 I like Shea moisture Jamaican black castor oil styling lotion, castor oil and gel to do my wash-n-go
1166 2018-05-29 22:01:49 Their fire roasted tomato and olive oil is quite tasty.
1167 2018-05-29 22:01:38 Damn my car sounds nice and loud after this oil change 
1168 2018-05-29 22:01:31 What is a good product for men who wear their hair natural? For some reason my hair just eats up the oil! 
1169 2018-05-29 22:01:29 Sure there are some disgraceful Martha fans which I acknowledge myself and in most cases choose to ignore them, yet there's also multiple Sarin fans who keep throwing oil on the fire by lording the H2H over our heads. It's seriously unnecessary. Also play fast & loose w/ "racism"
1170 2018-05-29 22:01:25 According to my parents dripping and cod liver oil got this country through two world wars and the great depression.
1171 2018-05-29 22:01:25 As long as @B_I_Tweets never submits any of it's 'Nudge Unit' work & 'research' to independent academic peer led review, it is nothing more than a purveyor of Snake Oil on a global level
1172 2018-05-29 22:01:20 Smokey ass house my mama burning oil n shit
1173 2018-05-29 22:01:19 yesterday my chest got burned because I forgot to apply tanning oil on there at the pool but now it’s turning into this golden crispy colour I’m getting so tan I love it
1174 2018-05-29 22:01:16 Who said anything about left, right or centre? I don't want a pipeline. As far as its economic "benefits," they are little more than snake oil.
1175 2018-05-29 22:00:55 cleant my car, got a car wash, oil change  i just need to go fill my tank up and imma be good 
1176 2018-05-29 22:00:54 any oil for curly hair recommend??
1177 2018-05-29 22:00:46 Science question: how do the garlic chips stay crispy in the oil?
1178 2018-05-29 22:00:39 The same as my take on clean coal, allowing mining sewage into rivers, lifting hunting bans on endangered species, drilling for more oil, banning Muslim countries indiscriminately, taking children from their parents and then losing them. There are no longer words to describe it.
1179 2018-05-29 22:00:31 Bananas avocado and extra birgin olive oil work work pretty good too

1183 2018-05-29 22:00:09 Everything you stated here will take years. It took over 20 years for the oil patch to recover from the NEP. Who knows how long it will take for this
1184 2018-05-29 22:00:03 Why didn’t Coupling House Obama do something semen the so-called Russian Tongue-Fuck when he was told wad it by the FBI whorehouse the Election? Because he man oil Prick Hillary was boobs to altar of love, and he didn’t member to lower lips the apple button-hole factory! He..
1185 2018-05-29 22:00:01 Interest in hemp oil is skyrocketing! Hemp Oil Extracts are going to help push the market to increase by 700% over the next 2 years. Making the Hemp market worth more than 2.1 billion dollars...
1186 2018-05-29 21:59:57 Yap. It is either the Iranians or the Saudis. I`ll show mine if you show me yours (oil reserves).
1187 2018-05-29 21:59:45 Yes. TMX expansion debate is not about GGEs. That oil is coming out of the ground no matter what.
1188 2018-05-29 21:59:39 The fact that you’re asking this shows how little you know about the war. The USA funded YPG are in Deir-ezzor at the oil fields, so yeah worth it. Earlier in the terrorists looted factories and  sent machinery to Qatar.  The ultimate goal was to topple the elected government
1189 2018-05-29 21:59:33 Dave you are not defending Roseanne?
1190 2018-05-29 21:59:31 Gaza is oil.  Never forget.
1191 2018-05-29 21:59:31 With this heat idk if to put sunblock, tanning oil, or seasoning.
1192 2018-05-29 21:59:26 Put oil on your face a fee times a week, eventually your face won’t produce as much oil...this is what ive heard anyway 
1193 2018-05-29 21:59:20 Who would you rather own an oil/gas pipeline? A fossil fuel company with zero interest in anything but getting the product to its destination? Or a government which implies the pipeline is now subject to government regulation and oversight? It exists, either way.
1194 2018-05-29 21:58:59 We certainly need oil. What we do not need is more oil. We are meant to scale down not up. That is key. It's not about saying no to everything, but no to "more, more, more". That is fundamental to why we are in so much trouble.
1195 2018-05-29 21:58:46 酔ってる間に飲み会が決まっていた
1196 2018-05-29 21:58:32 Not garbage, a master snake oil salesman. Can't believe how gullible people are.
1197 2018-05-29 21:58:31 This is spot on. If we are weak internally, we can be exploited by enemies foreign and domestic. Folks like Erik Prince, the Mercers et al have no loyalties to anything but $$ and power. They are in bed with Russia, China, middle eastern oil interests.
1198 2018-05-29 21:58:23 @therealroseanne U live in Hawaii-have UANY idea what this MAN-MADE climate change will affect it the ocean's rising as  polar caps melt? U like Trump's reversing laws which now will pollute even further our lakes,rivers,& streams w/toxic  coal/oil runoffs?

1202 2018-05-29 21:58:01 I think you're halfway there. Try solution of white vinegar, water and plenty! of cinnamon oil drops. Put this around and in (I know that sounds cruel) their access/entry points. Cinnamon seems to create no-go zone. Worked for me.
1203 2018-05-29 21:57:56 don't forget to factor oil into your budget
1204 2018-05-29 21:57:55 Have to take my lavender oil to the spa tomorrow
1205 2018-05-29 21:57:28 Fresh shower plus coconut oil omg
1206 2018-05-29 21:57:22 Good lord- Trudeau has actually said the words “phase out oil and gas”, and people still don’t believe it.  And the dumb ones think it’s a good idea.
1207 2018-05-29 21:57:22 Skip the oil.
1208 2018-05-29 21:57:17 @MBuhari time to stop your fixation on oil!
1209 2018-05-29 21:57:15 might depend upon location. I sure as hell do not want to visit a restroom where puke is everywhere, toilet paper is strewn about the floor and the toilet seat is wet with piss. Do they sell gasoline and check the oil of one's car at @Starbucks?
1210 2018-05-29 21:57:08 Fr Coconut oil helped me rejuvenate my skin and then I use baby oil gel too. It helps.
1211 2018-05-29 21:57:07 I guess the priorities of the Liberals is clear for all their #PoliticalBullshitting to the contrary. Wonder what the Cons spent? In any case, we understand that the oil / gas industry is the main meal deal. @JustinTrudeau @AndrewScheer @RachelNotley Oil not people. @jkenney
1212 2018-05-29 21:57:06 She said “coconut oil and honey baths” he said “ what about soap” and she blocked him
1213 2018-05-29 21:56:57 In short, most of the changes are domestic. Economically, there is a big push to reduce the dependency on oil by diversifying the Kingdom’s investments. Hell, the Sovereign Fund is an investor in Uber. Also, there is a crackdown on corruption, which was rampant for a long time.
1214 2018-05-29 21:56:50 Best of luck!!
1215 2018-05-29 21:56:45 I changed the oil in the CRV today and quickly realized why I'm a bought not built sort of guy.
1216 2018-05-29 21:56:44 Me I dnt care if u tell me to save ma tweet bro

 Its actually anointing oil...
1217 2018-05-29 21:56:30 i went to an auto body shop to get my oil changed and instead the mechanic started asking me if i was single! what a day!
1218 2018-05-29 21:56:24 The AMA is a joke.
1219 2018-05-29 21:56:13 True, PoOil decoupled from its strong XEU correlation. Will that result in excess PP for the parties in the oil exporting countries that are expected to be interested in phys gold accumulation?
1220 2018-05-29 21:56:04 Sunlight + olive oil
1221 2018-05-29 21:56:00 While Arab oil dollars flowed into Palestine for Hajj Amin al Husseini to arm his Islamist terrorists under the guise of restoring Al Aqsa.

1228 2018-05-29 21:55:29 Many of us don’t buy into the phoney process followed, nor your pipeline policy in general.....even before the outrageous act of bailing out a Texas oil co. with taxpayers money.  Your party lied to us during the scampaign.
1229 2018-05-29 21:55:26 I honestly don't know why @JustinTrudeau would buy a pipeline when oil is on a downward spiral and we should be using that money to build green energy
1230 2018-05-29 21:55:17 Shout out to Pep Boys for fixing my windshield wipers (for free) and the oil change!!!
1231 2018-05-29 21:55:09 If you're eating vegan and feeling shitty try adding more fat into your diet. Seriously. coconut oil. Peanut butter. Avocado. Eat alot of it. Your body needs that shit

1233 2018-05-29 21:54:58 I'm starting two of my dogs on CBD oil. Pretty excited to see how it helps with their anxiety. Gonna have to use it on myself if it works.
1234 2018-05-29 21:54:53 To admit Musk is basically a snake oil salesman would be to realise what a gullible nincompoop you've been.

1244 2018-05-29 21:54:11 Do you support the expansion of oil sands production, in the face of all the evidence of fossil fuel contribution to the impact of climate change, which will also affect "our waters"....?
1245 2018-05-29 21:54:07 Investing Billions of government $$$ in future returns on oil is like being on the Titanic and betting on the iceberg. It's not what climate leaders would do
1246 2018-05-29 21:54:00 We are decades away but trudeau was elected with record turnout of young voters on the platform that he would continue using our oil under the agreement that we wouldnt build anymore long term infrastructure, just using what we have.

1249 2018-05-29 21:53:36 They gain nothing from this. The oil will last as long as it lasts, obviously. This article won't change the levels of oil reserves.
1250 2018-05-29 21:53:35 An independent Scotland would be entitled to 9 per cent of the oil revenues, not 90 per cent -
1251 2018-05-29 21:53:32 @JMV1070  how about CBD oil suppositories?
1252 2018-05-29 21:53:32 The places that you say are to blame for overpopulation don't use half the things that are causing problems that we do. Water, oil, food etc. If western countries moved back to sustainable methods of production, you'd see a substantial improvement.

1256 2018-05-29 21:53:08 If Trudeau #1 wanted to secure an energy rich, profitable future for Canadians, why do we still import oil, why use taxes to build pipelines, why talk to an idiot from BC, why pay $1.40/ltr, & was  Petro Canada an acronym for Pierre Elliott Trudeau Rips Off Canada? Justin?

1258 2018-05-29 21:52:48 wtf my mum just asked me if I would drink a spoonful of oil if my life depended on it
1259 2018-05-29 21:52:38 I'm sure he owns oil stock.
1260 2018-05-29 21:52:35 He’s even addressing the higher gas and oil prices. OPEC and Russia will increase production after pressure from Trump already credited with lowering prices.
1261 2018-05-29 21:52:32 At least we have that great quote as an example of why climate is such a difficult problem! I'd rather have fewer emissions from heavy oil, though...
1262 2018-05-29 21:52:17 Have you tried warm olive oil? That's supposed to work.
1263 2018-05-29 21:52:11 From Amazon description: "Mild chili oil within fried garlic. recent chiri oil boom in Japan was started from this product."

Not sure if mild racism or something genuinely lost in translation there.
1264 2018-05-29 21:52:08 Fears of worsening Italian credit send global markets reeling and the SP down over 1% touching he 200 day moving average.

1278 2018-05-29 21:51:03 Higher oil prices are the consummation of Putin's efforts to elect Trump. "Mission Accomplished."
1279 2018-05-29 21:51:01 As an employee of a big oil company I can tell you with certainty that oil prices(gas) are a tad bit inflated right now. Hang in there honey. 
1280 2018-05-29 21:50:39 The US needs hundred dollars a barrel for the cash bleeding US shale oil industry.

1283 2018-05-29 21:50:26 Ground cinnamon+honey is my absolute fav! Acts both as a mild scrub and mask. 
Olive oil +sugar + lime juice 
 oil + coffee grounds 
Mashed papaya (mild exfoliant) 
And I use local rose + sugar + coconut  oil combo as a body scrub which is again a fav!
1284 2018-05-29 21:50:25 You must be a Democrat. You are outraged when oil company profits go up 4% a gallon, but the govt taxing the same gallon of gas at 15% is okay.  Gas always goes up in the Summer....
1285 2018-05-29 21:50:25 Yup except night lotion sleeping mask. I pakai yg basic skincare tmbh tea tree oil n spot treatment dia. Effect nmpk lmbt sikit tp mmg ada perubahan lah for me.
1286 2018-05-29 21:50:22 It isn't about "smooshing", it's simply a result of the steaming/pre-cooking process (and in your brand's case the effects of adding oil, presumably so it doesn't stick together).
1287 2018-05-29 21:50:13 Delusional. You send soldiers to die for oil to kill natives in their own land but yet somehow are the good guys
1288 2018-05-29 21:50:12 SHOOT! I didn't know I ran out of my hair oil! MY HAIR IS GETTING SO FRIZZY AAAAAAAA *runs to the store*
1289 2018-05-29 21:50:11 I almost forgot I was a goddess until I put on my swimsuit and tanning oil. Just been staring at myself in the mirror, blowing myself kisses, now I’m going in my driveway to wash my car. No flash photography please.
1290 2018-05-29 21:50:10 Maybe if Soros was not playing with Oil futures to artificially raise the prices. We would not be in this situation. Also it will cause more drilling in the US. Which you said was economic growth under Obama.

1292 2018-05-29 21:49:30 This is my first time getting my oil change by someone else, and I’m never doing this again. I should’ve just done it by myself, lmaooo.
1293 2018-05-29 21:49:30 If I'm wrong, explain how gas cost $4.11/gl on avg in 2008 when oil was $147 a barrel (reaping record profits for Exxon, et al.), and the cost now is approx $3.30/gl, while the July contract is at $66/brl. If the futures market sets prices, should be below $2/gallon.
1294 2018-05-29 21:49:27 Shampoo destroys the vital oil that permeates through your scalp. This oil could be used to power your car, cook with, and many more important utilizations. Yet we give it away for free? Yeah not me. That's why I refuse to shower.
1295 2018-05-29 21:49:10 Well, choosing to drastically reduce our oil consumption goes beyond personal product choice. It's a societal and political choice that needs to be made as well, and it looks like those land firmly on the side of fossil fuels, no matter how damaging they are in the long term.
1296 2018-05-29 21:49:09 What a silly naive statement, there are a lot of success liars, ever hear the term snake oil salesman? Because that describes ken ham, and many other people who profit off faith
1297 2018-05-29 21:49:00 Krazy Keith could use the same language on ESPN he uses on social media & probably still keep his job. You don’t get more low life than this POS.
1298 2018-05-29 21:48:59 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
1299 2018-05-29 21:48:57 Oh myyy goodness!! Use castor oil bai!! It will make yuh hair grow
1300 2018-05-29 21:48:45 Were is the 'The Insider' of the oil industry.
1301 2018-05-29 21:48:32 Aditionally oil and Crypto (normally) are both deflationary. 
1302 2018-05-29 21:48:17 Can I come oil your scalp?
1303 2018-05-29 21:48:13 Saudi Aramco has spent more than $4.5 billion in contracts to oil companies to increase their natural gas production domestically. One of those contracts recently has been signed to Halliburton.With their decades of experience in oil and shale gas drilling-it explains why.
1304 2018-05-29 21:48:11 I’m really dead after that nap which is why I don’t take them but I didn’t want to be waiting all day at Chevy for an oil change so early I went!
1305 2018-05-29 21:47:58 Good for makeup removal like baby oil but, just like baby oil, it’s not a moisturizer, especially for dry/ damaged skin.
1306 2018-05-29 21:47:56 I prefer govt stay out of private industry normally, except Kenney demanded the federal government do exactly what they just did.  Many infrastructure projects are funded by the public purse, because they are too large or lack profitability. Early oil sands heavily subsidized
1307 2018-05-29 21:47:54 LMFAOOO IM WEAKKKK. truly. 
i think i might've put on some organic coconut lotion i have or maybe my whipped shea butter/ coconut oil mixture i made at home
1308 2018-05-29 21:47:49 Scrolling down to view this, I thought the oil platform *was* a Chris Foss painting!
1309 2018-05-29 21:47:49 Totally false. True, gas companies don't set the cost for the price of oil -- that's done by market speculators, but they set prices based on the cost of oil & perceived effects on the market, like increased holiday driving, impact of hurricane season, etc.
1310 2018-05-29 21:47:45 ... will face the threat/s of oil spills ... plural ...
1311 2018-05-29 21:47:45 You digging for oil or gold ??
1312 2018-05-29 21:47:37 What led to Obama's veto? Maybe ineffective action from the federal government for years? Shale oil spiked so Obama felt enabled to prioritize his own country's interests over international ones.
1313 2018-05-29 21:47:23 "nooo you still want a massage Willa, because i have a new oil that is a brownie scented one~"
1314 2018-05-29 21:47:14 All three parties are largely pro-corporate bagmen. NDP in AB pushing crude & oil pipelines. Cons undermine public trust by attacking science, putting hacks in regulatory jobs, & selling trade deals in secret. Liberals building a pipeline for oilmen & signing Con trade deals.
1315 2018-05-29 21:47:10 man @JustinTrudeau is thirsty for oil
1316 2018-05-29 21:47:05 The ratio on this. Phew. 
Mine was David Charvet in Baywatch.
1317 2018-05-29 21:47:03 The "investment climate" is thanks to the mid-2014 plummet in the price of oil and oil-related capex declined globally. It's on its way back now.
1318 2018-05-29 21:46:48 This pic is brought to you by Oil of Olay rejuvenating cream!
1319 2018-05-29 21:46:35 «Hei, la oss fjerne oil fra navnet vårt, kanskje folk tror vi er miljøvennlige da??»
1320 2018-05-29 21:46:27 My guess is Irving Oil has pockets for this
1321 2018-05-29 21:46:20 Please continue to work on all your forward thinking, sustainable projects. It must be so hard to be constantly under attack because you are not part of the big corrupt power machine made up of gas, oil etc.
1322 2018-05-29 21:46:12 I just splashed hot fry oil on my face, it was at least the third most painful thing I’ve felt.
1323 2018-05-29 21:46:07 Reason?
You're with someone?
You're a giving her attitude or what?
1324 2018-05-29 21:45:58 Nice work Jim Linton and Folk oil.
1325 2018-05-29 21:45:57 If you guys can't resolve my problem then you should just shut your business and sell oil only. Do business what you're good at. Don't take our hard earn money and enjoy with it.
1326 2018-05-29 21:45:55 Awww maybe she was young and confused then and she knows better now...
1327 2018-05-29 21:45:50 The effort to find alternative energy is under way world wide, but we aren’t there yet so we must consume oil. People here and around the world still need to go to work and so we drive..... and that is just one application of oil... there are many.
1328 2018-05-29 21:45:37 Ann Sothern, but that was awhile ago
1329 2018-05-29 21:45:35 The Kushner-Trumps asked for personal loans from Qatar and were denied. Sanctions were put on Qatar, Qatar agrees to loans, sanctions disappear. 
Tiny Qatar never wanted to loan them money on their failing 666 project. 
(TRUMP also has a big Russian oil deal in the Arctic. )
1330 2018-05-29 21:45:20 A tie between the DJ on Northern Exposure (John Corbett) and Scott Bakula on Quantum Leap.
1331 2018-05-29 21:45:06 Saying Bush caused 9/11 to control the Afghan drug trade is just stupid. There’s far more money in oil. But even saying Bush and his administration were clever enough to think that shit up is also stupid. Those people don’t need to kill thousands to make money they run the world
1332 2018-05-29 21:45:05 Trudeau #1 created the Nat’l Energy Program in the eighties to insure “security of supply and ultimate independence from the world oil market; opportunity for all Canadians to participate in the energy industry;” Well,  @JustinTrudeau — we sure as hell are all in it now!
1333 2018-05-29 21:45:03 have you tried cbd oil before?
1334 2018-05-29 21:45:01 Its a long story my guy,since level 2 fa
1335 2018-05-29 21:44:53 I got a deluxe sample of the Sunday Riley Luna Sleeping Night Oil... I’m trying to figure out how I can justify spending $105 for 1 oz of product.
1336 2018-05-29 21:44:51 With subsidies of $2.4b per annum in 2013 & 2014 to oil and gas producers in Canada I am calling you out on this claim. Let’s call this what it is. It’s a lie.
1337 2018-05-29 21:44:47 If you read the whole thing, you will see that the writer was trying to demonize the woman. Semi-implying that is it bad to be pro-life or support NRA...

Good evening. Keri here Massage Therapist and essential oil Wellness Advocate passionate about empowering your self care!
1340 2018-05-29 21:44:11 Lord Lugard said "The North and the South of Nigeria are like oil and water, they will never mix". He amalgamated both regions in 1914.
1341 2018-05-29 21:44:04 oil will always have a place in the economy, petroleum alone isn't the byproduct of oil, your "solar powered" car's dashboard is a total product of oil. Yes, petroleum sales may decline but it's effect on oil sales is immutable.
1342 2018-05-29 21:43:51 An awlful lot of hardcore but it's a pity there is no room for building a society. What is the financial cost of this war and who is paying for it? Does oil pay for this madness on the futures market? What does this war cost Russia with its economic sanctions in tow? The U.S. ?
1343 2018-05-29 21:43:47 Do see your point of view, I don't agree with it, but I can see how it's annoying that a team like Florida lost a top talent, and a team like Oil lost an AHL wannabe plug D man. NMCs are a bitch, and quite frankly, I don't like them. But now maybe more players waive for Seattle.
1344 2018-05-29 21:43:43 Can't wait to see! Facial oil?
1345 2018-05-29 21:43:36 Nice boobas
1346 2018-05-29 21:43:32 FUN FACT: Petro Canada was founded as a crown corporation in 1975, and remained as such until it was privatized in 1990. 
The federal government didn’t divest all of its interest in P.C. until 2004. 

Chill your “ermehgerd oil is socialist now” balls. This happens.
#KinderMorgan
1347 2018-05-29 21:43:07 More profits for oil companies to use, in order to lie to the public about how harmful their products are. I would suggest socializing oil, but governments are renowned for screwing up good things. If we reduce our consumption, #solar #wind and #tidal energies become plausible.
1348 2018-05-29 21:42:52 Wow people really take it personally when that snake oil salesman gets criticised.
1349 2018-05-29 21:42:41 Got my oil changed!
Adulting today 
1350 2018-05-29 21:42:17 Oil prices were actually cheaper before Obama's reckless #IranDeal that released $150 billions to the Ayatollahs that used to destabilize the region that partly contributed to higher oil prices.
1351 2018-05-29 21:41:37 I'm open to all ideas. "likely to contribute to carbon lock-in and a long-term oversupply of oil, slowing the world’s transition to a low-carbon future." I'm more bullish on a low carbon future, and I'd rather we profit from current oil needs to get there.
1352 2018-05-29 21:41:30 Some days I really miss college and some days that’s only because I want @Brueggers Rosemary and olive oil bagels and there’s none close to me 
1353 2018-05-29 21:41:30 Can a fish breath oil
1354 2018-05-29 21:41:29 Loud curly-haired Jewish-y women from NYC were your type? I’m dead, Will.
1355 2018-05-29 21:41:27 #pnpcbc I understand that nationalizing Canada's oil assets is what Liberals named Trudeau do but I find it hard to believe that after the NEP Albertans are actually praising nationalization of the KM pipeline.
1356 2018-05-29 21:41:23 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
1357 2018-05-29 21:41:23 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1358 2018-05-29 21:41:16 when you hydrogenate a plant oil, it becomes like lard, so it stays semi-solid at room temperature. this also creates a high trans-fat content artificially. they're regulating those things, not the naturally occurring animal ones

1360 2018-05-29 21:40:44 People, this piece was written by yet another delusional writer. How do I know? It starts with a lie "23 school shootings this year". Could as well call this "let me make up  to show that not only DNC turds are stupid". Bet this is all twisted out of proportion.

1363 2018-05-29 21:40:34 I once shot a tv with a Lee Engfield, does that count?
1364 2018-05-29 21:40:33 Haha you actually think that barrel of oil is only 67 bucks but your paying all time high at the pumps but you still love the liberals and think things will change

1406 2018-05-29 21:36:28 And the truthful fact is it will always be that way, water and oil does not mix.
1407 2018-05-29 21:36:23 But could you please stop letting people drill in our national parks and our wildlife reserves?  We have enough oil and gas without destroying everything else that we have.  I know that you and your sons hunt game and trophies.  I don't believe in that,

1414 2018-05-29 21:35:56 But I didn't do that. What I said, very specifically, was when you have enough followers on Twitter you need to be aware that your interactions are not 1 on 1. And it's true. Nothing to do with political correctness, or big Oil. It's true of all of us with millions of followers.
1415 2018-05-29 21:35:55 Yu be working with oil ? Lol
1416 2018-05-29 21:35:54 Most natural gurus either got pregnant and/or use some type of hair pill or oil to make their hair grow. That’s fine. But don’t act like you didn’t when you did.
1417 2018-05-29 21:35:52 I understand, but u have to think wise,
1418 2018-05-29 21:35:45 Oil company should come and employ me 
1419 2018-05-29 21:35:42 Next time I get an oil change I’ll pay a man to come with me. Mf’s see a young female alone always try to take advantage. “Ma’am your engine is falling apart you shouldn’t be driving this”. Ya ok shut up and change my oil John.

1431 2018-05-29 21:34:14 Is it true that Canada/Alberta is losing approx. $15 Billion as year due to oil export discount to US?  and that #transmountainpipeline will eliminate this discount.
My google search & Premier Notley confirm "yes"

Make una clarify the type of oil and the position to be held . Not just oil job
1453 2018-05-29 21:32:11 The #TransMountainPipeline expansion also implies that oil extraction needs to be increased. But it doesn't. It's a finite resource that we can exploit in a more sustainable, careful manner. The faster we use it up, the less time we have to... exploit it.
1454 2018-05-29 21:32:10 Are you f’ing kidding me. Get the f^*k out of my feed you snake oil selling huckster.
1455 2018-05-29 21:32:09 Oil
1456 2018-05-29 21:32:05 We should be upfront about the changes we’d make in managing the oil industry. It’s an opportunity to show the difference an Indy Scotland would make. Oil has been mismanaged by the UK. We shouldn’t just be hiding our embarrassment because the market is volatile. Let’s promote.
1457 2018-05-29 21:32:01  I’m dying absolutely dying at my mam telling me she has been told Holland and Barrett and asked if they sell cannabis oil

1471 2018-05-29 21:31:11 Good point. Libya produces oil . All the money is either being stolen and transferred to neighbouring countries or the subsidized items being bought are smuggled there . If they contain the inconveniences they can live with status quo for a lot longer than 5 years

Are BC & Quebec the only Canadian provinces working to create a greener future?
1481 2018-05-29 21:30:09 Dude, 90% of buildings are already shuttered/abandoned, we've got casinos, an oil refinery, giant garbage hills with gas flames burning, trains that don't go anywhere, and a lake that had the bodies of dead hookers dumped in it. It writes itself!

1488 2018-05-29 21:29:28 Got myself an cordless electric lawn mower since gas prices up here (Saskatchewan - Canada) are back where they were before the oil plunge.   $110/barrel - $1.22/litre.  $66/barrel - $1.24/litre.
1489 2018-05-29 21:29:25 As pointed out today. Trudeau spent 4.5 billion to buy an oil pipeline. While First Nation communities don’t even have clean drinking water. Billions that could have been invested into green energy
1490 2018-05-29 21:29:20 Is it just me or is it unnerving that the public radio station is running ads for Exxon mobile? Can’t we just tax the oil company and find @NPR public radio that way? Direct funding of public media by and oil company can lead to a slippery slope of influence.
1491 2018-05-29 21:29:11 Homemade coconut oil, Shea butter and crabb oil haven’t failed me
1492 2018-05-29 21:29:01 Bad news for Canada?? Own our own pipeline and get full value for our oil? Am I missing something.....that isn't partisan I mean.
1493 2018-05-29 21:28:54 What scares me is now the east controls western oil
1494 2018-05-29 21:28:43 There seems to be a lot of manual overhead, and time, and selenium or other dependencies for some AI services to “work”, whatever that means. Are they selling snake oil? Seems like it.
1495 2018-05-29 21:28:41 It's a good time to be selling an oil pipeline.
1496 2018-05-29 21:28:17 So, the Liberal party wants to get into the oil/pipeline business. Terrific, like dad, I am sure Justin and team will be great at it. This solution does nothing to address the fundamental problems of encouraging private capital investment and Provincial vs Federal jurisdiction.

Such a waste of talent and resources, but that's socialism/authoritarianism...

1544 2018-05-29 21:23:27 Pipelines are transportation for multiple businesses...and, as such, are foundational for the entire oil and gas sector. This kind of broad public interest is what justifies public ownership. And it’s why the comparison with roads is appropriate (they’re needed for commerce, too)
1545 2018-05-29 21:23:26 So the better way to put it might be, hold demand fixed, incremental emissions are then difference in emission intensity of oil sands vs alternative replacement supply. If that’s 50%, we get to the 3.4MT incremental global emissions.

Admittedly *very* rough...

1570 2018-05-29 21:20:43 Just got an oil change and the guy said i drove 7000 miles on my car in 7 weeks. #Lol
1571 2018-05-29 21:20:37 Tesla have no business case. Modern day snake oil.
1572 2018-05-29 21:20:35 i feel like youd get better mileage from a deep fryer since it cooks all over and you won't have to flip it, at the cost of excessive oil.
1573 2018-05-29 21:20:34 Politicians today can only watch as the new imperialists spread their tentacles around the globe.
Starbucks, Google, Tesco, Microsoft, banks, insurance and oil giants, eBay and Apple, the aim is the same as every imperialist in history.
More money, more power, no price too high.
1574 2018-05-29 21:20:34 This is bullshit. Do politicians think we are fools? His two minutes with Kagame outweighed thousands of hours dedicated by Kagame's team, researching and producing fact-based white papers?

Is that measure still on the table?

1578 2018-05-29 21:20:30 Start putting baking soda on your face for about 20min twice a day if you have naturally oily skin it reduces oil my dermatologist told me this shit has been hella beneficial
1579 2018-05-29 21:20:27 Do you recommend to get specifically the grapeseed oil or some skin care product which contains it?
1580 2018-05-29 21:20:16 I agree. @JustinTrudeau is nothing more than another oil hungry politician with lots of fuzzy warm rhetoric but zero credibility. #votegreen
1581 2018-05-29 21:20:10 I Aldo mix coconut oil in the mixture
1582 2018-05-29 21:20:04 that’s why i put mineral oil in the tequila.

1584 2018-05-29 21:19:54 Wonder how much oil is carried from the streets and parking lots of the  of the lower mainland into the ocean with each rainfall through the sewer system?

1591 2018-05-29 21:19:26 What?????? Pipelines are the safest most environmentally efficient way to oil. The royalties, taxes and investment this project could gave created would have been enormous. Eco fascists are the worst.

1597 2018-05-29 21:18:38 ok so my @shophoneyrose smells like canola oil.

and i still havent gotten 3 products that were supposed to be shipped with the oil.
1598 2018-05-29 21:18:20 That oil is meant for the export market, not for Canada. Also, all these techs are "ways down the line" is precisely because no one is willing to put money into it to develop it in earnest
1599 2018-05-29 21:18:20 Bitter ppl
1600 2018-05-29 21:18:10 Hmm, most foods you gave here are pretty lean missing some of those great fats that we need. I would remake some of the list and add nuts, avocado's and coconut oil. Still great that we have someone putting out great content. Keep it coming 
1601 2018-05-29 21:18:08 Money for his legal expenses. It's like a snake oil carnie show.  The people who support him and the degradation of our country are disgusting, no matter what reason they give.
1602 2018-05-29 21:18:05 How does wall street profit from oil here in Nigeria...?

I'm curious
1603 2018-05-29 21:18:05 Because of constant opposition, the taxpayers are on the hook for the pipeline purchase. The NDP have only themselves to blame. Stop B.C. from importing coal and dumping sewage into the ocean before blaming Alberta for oil. Where is everyone's outrage over that?

1612 2018-05-29 21:17:29 Sadly you have only the taxpayer to skin for research and development dollars. FAR better to sell oil to foreigners and use proceeds to more rapidly develop healthy green tech. This is too simple for you to understand? Taxpayers already overburdened and you want to add more.
1613 2018-05-29 21:17:13 The money that the pipeline will bring in by selling oil, should pay for that clean water on all First Nations in this country. Funds must come from somewhere. The @liberal_party has wasted billions upon billions and they still haven't fixed the water issues on FN. Massive fail

If scientists paid that much, it might be worth considering.

1650 2018-05-29 21:14:04 I might remind all that the Bush family oil corporation did not come into play when a war that was (see Bugliosis Book) in the WRONG country that had sold their oil refining rights to France and Russia happened. No French fries, etc.

1676 2018-05-29 21:12:48 So the pipeline is built and shipping oil? No. So time to party yet. Tell me when it’s actually built.
1677 2018-05-29 21:12:44 Yeah I see all the reviews for castor oil are mainly used on eyebrows  you're so lucky, I have thin and fine hair  the worst combo
1678 2018-05-29 21:12:44 @CNBCFastMoney @timseymour Some of the tone on the desk sounds like #Italy's economy has stopped, no more producing Ferraris, clothes, olive oil...  Why is everyone SO negative after a selloff? Italy...
1679 2018-05-29 21:12:44 All 3000 pipeline labourers and up to 10000 subsidy jobs for the summer and still bitumen is not regulated like oil pipeline spills because bitumen is not oil.
1680 2018-05-29 21:12:41 Madness 9.9trn on recurrent expenditure, not sustainable. Each state should look inwards harnessing there comparative advantages to develop their respective GDP's. Its a ticking time bomb as nations move from oil to clean energy, AI, greater automation and technological change

1685 2018-05-29 21:12:13 Have you ever used popcorn butter as motor oil
1686 2018-05-29 21:12:11 That is  ways down the line – is it not better 2 have a responsible country with responsible companies  with environmental standards, labour standards, and not harbouring terrorist produce oil? More Canada oil means less bad oil. We import oil to Canada does that make sense?
1687 2018-05-29 21:12:11 Epic.
1688 2018-05-29 21:12:11 Who gets the subsidy? As I read it, everybody gets the same amount, regardless of income or how much energy you use. That seems way different that subsidies for energy sources chosen by the government (whether it's oil, nuclear, solar or wind)
1689 2018-05-29 21:12:07 don't even go there

1692 2018-05-29 21:11:42 ,,,and nobody is going to do a damn thing about it. Well, except finance a new oil pipeline.
1693 2018-05-29 21:11:42 Green energy isn't viable. The technology isn't there clearly. Hence why the government has to subsidize It, through money it's collected from a viable industry (oil).
1694 2018-05-29 21:11:40 Yes - though I also get the point about oil being the cherry on the cake rather than a resource we‘re forced to rely on. The bonus of oil should go straight to an investment fund.
1695 2018-05-29 21:11:39 You bet they do, I see larger transfer payments and a chunk of the oil revenue coming up as a punishment.

1707 2018-05-29 21:10:47 extraction technology has never sat still since the neolithic, but esp in the oil biz, the faster the rules change the more players get away with. reserves etc determined by a mix of 3 card monty, shell game,& zoltan the fortune telling machine
1708 2018-05-29 21:10:45 Sunsets can be long or short. It doesn't mean they are not sunsets.  Green energy or electric transport (2 different things) in infancy. Doesn't mean they will not be adults. Oil industry will always be there for plastics (about 3% of current vol) etc.

1717 2018-05-29 21:10:07 Oil dropped in 2009 as well and the jobs did not evaporate... the NDP coupled with Liberal business uncertainty made a bad situation significantly worse.

1719 2018-05-29 21:10:03 The #oil rig count in Texas now sits at 1,013. During the last three months, the count has only dipped once. Via @oilandgas360
1720 2018-05-29 21:09:56 Unemployed oil workers vs Hippies. The pay per view revenue will cover the 10 billion dollar boondoggle this will end up being.
1721 2018-05-29 21:09:56 So do you think that you can suck all the oil and minerals out of the earth, kill millions of animals a day, fill the oceans with plastics and trash, oil spills, methane gas and smog, lead filled pipes don't effect your life? Just asking
1722 2018-05-29 21:09:50 Our friends on the Left who talk all the time about "alternative" energy need to adjust their spell-check.
Solar, wind and bio-mass are SUBSIDIZED energy. 
Coal, Oil, natural gas, hydro are ALTERNATIVE  energy sources that actually create more energy than they cost.
1723 2018-05-29 21:09:49 Solid choice.
1724 2018-05-29 21:09:45 Why are we all insisting on exporting oil? Sell the raw materials, buy back the value added stuff. Why don't we do the value adding? Why do we persist in being the world's drawers of water and hewers of wood? You have no more vision than they do.

1726 2018-05-29 21:09:32 In fact the entire market is down too. Along with the price of oil. Who knew Roseanne was so influential.
1727 2018-05-29 21:09:31 Heath Ledger  I could watch the Patriot all day, errday. And cry every single time he dies. RIP.
1728 2018-05-29 21:09:27 yes.
1729 2018-05-29 21:09:20 This thing is deep. Only a man in your shoe can understand what you're going through. I once begged Allah to give me a stone heart in order to threaten the person. I was thinking that would make her leave but hell NO!
1730 2018-05-29 21:09:14 Harry was pretty funny though. And John Larroquette was a great foil. 

Solid show.
1731 2018-05-29 21:09:07 *extreme london middle class voice* good olive oil really does make all the difference
1732 2018-05-29 21:09:05 I just put to much oil on. I’m not gonna lie, I was having nightmares of that dudes face split open.. I shouldn’t of been losing sleep over him lol.
1733 2018-05-29 21:08:54 That Jamaican oil and tea tree oil and that black soap tho >>>>>

1735 2018-05-29 21:08:31 We had like one channel that came in well during college. Charles in Charge and Mr Belvedere every afternoon
1736 2018-05-29 21:08:29 i don’t know why people put coconut oil in they face. hair and body only.
1737 2018-05-29 21:08:29 Oh, you must have raw eggs (the yolks) and oil in your kitchen. You could just whip a little together. Just a tiny bit. One yolk. Some oil. Spread on bread. Feed the rest to the dog.
1738 2018-05-29 21:08:23 Get some tanning oil and lather that good stuff on
1739 2018-05-29 21:08:19 Damn! Took me a week, was hoping to avoid your snake oil for more days
1740 2018-05-29 21:08:19 LOL
1741 2018-05-29 21:08:18 Please write the answer to how to convert Oil industry into Green industry Era now. I am all ears, Canadians need this change Grandfathered in, so it is best move for everybody! No more grey area! Just a middle of 3 tier goodness! PEACE!
1742 2018-05-29 21:08:16 Time for my vehicle to get an oil change so guess it’s time for me to sit and wait
1743 2018-05-29 21:08:13 Yes. Alternatively crumbled parmesan and crushed pork rinds makes a bomb low carb coating too

Just make sure you're using a heat friendly oil like coconut oil, animal fats, or olive oil (not extra virgin)
seed oils suck
1744 2018-05-29 21:08:11 Same, such a pain in the arse. The boob specialist I saw put me on evening primrose oil, made such a difference, hasn't gone completely but I no longer cry from pain. Hoping to lose weight from them tho, who even needs such big boobs?!
1745 2018-05-29 21:08:08 Don't you have olive oil? Or rapeseed oil? 
1746 2018-05-29 21:08:01 Well put!
1747 2018-05-29 21:08:00 So to really dumb everything down here and tune out noise: We had RECORD long spec positioning in Euro AND Oil. We also had VERY extreme bond positioning...
1748 2018-05-29 21:07:56 En los bolsos de López, en los hoteles , en las propiedades de Báez, de Rudy Ulloa, en la caja de la hija, en oil combustibles, en el despilfarro en artistas mercenarios, y te digo donde falta, en la matanza, en las cloacas, agua potable, en asfalto, en educación, en salud.
1749 2018-05-29 21:07:48 I need a boyfriend, purely because my dads starting to get annoyed at having to show me how to change the water and oil in my car every month 
1750 2018-05-29 21:07:37 Bullshit!!  the oil would be burned anyways, now we may get a fair price for it and can put some of the profits and royalties toward going green.
1751 2018-05-29 21:07:36 What ever you’re tweeting on is predominantly made from oil or oil byproducts.
1752 2018-05-29 21:07:34 Ehen, so u go just sit down for house and allow garri, oil, rice, beans, fuel, coconut, yam price to increase for another 4 years abi?
1753 2018-05-29 21:07:32 Norway's oil industry has been national from day 1, no? Real q.
1754 2018-05-29 21:07:31 That's thermal pad oil, overtime the thermal pads will release that which is normal.  It's non conductive so if you wipe it down, you shouldn't worry about it. Unless you have an AIO and it sprung a leak lol
1755 2018-05-29 21:07:28 Aisha's and breaking hearts...
1756 2018-05-29 21:07:20 May go into a comma after i get this oil change
1757 2018-05-29 21:07:17 Kelly Kapowski
1758 2018-05-29 21:07:17 And you have even bigger issues.
1759 2018-05-29 21:07:11 My black soap has tea tree oil in it and when I tell y'all that shit makes my face feel so good 
1760 2018-05-29 21:06:59 Oil me up. 
1761 2018-05-29 21:06:58 Dealerships have the best oil.
1762 2018-05-29 21:06:54 Wow the @NCAA is a complete and utter joke. This is super embarrassing and shows either stupidity or incompetence...or both.  "NCAA says player taking CBD oil to prevent seizures can't play football in college"   Awesome job @NCAAResearch Really really good!!!!!
1763 2018-05-29 21:06:54 That thing smells like a Forbes lister's pee might smell, mahn! The candle and bath oil are alright but the perfume itself...nahhhhh fam!
1764 2018-05-29 21:06:49 You have issues.
1765 2018-05-29 21:06:44 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines
1766 2018-05-29 21:06:43 The fuels for our cars and planes and other transport is trickier, of course. But i feel if govt's actually want to do something to cut down on emissions and reliance on oil, then they HAVE start investing in that tech and not in backwards means
1767 2018-05-29 21:06:41 Oh yeah. I discovered Nicole on a little-known HBO movie before that show came out.

1770 2018-05-29 21:06:34 For frying I use a ceramic pan that doesn’t need any fat, but I like to use a bit of grass fed butter, avocado or coconut oil anyway. 
1771 2018-05-29 21:06:33 Got my Jamaican Castor Oil 
1772 2018-05-29 21:06:30 As a young child of Greek migrants our cuisine was somewhat different in the 50’s but I do remember olive oil only being available at the pharmacy!!! How strange for my parents.
1773 2018-05-29 21:06:29 Lol, I don’t mind. You start off with Adobo and Saźon. A spoonful of goya Recaitio( which is sold in the frozen section) Then you mix it all with oil and vinegar. Marinate, and then fry.
1774 2018-05-29 21:06:24 If ditching electoral reform didn't kill the federal Liberals' chance of re-election, buying a multi-billion dollar illegal oil pipeline instead of e.g. getting fresh water to every last indigenous community, should totally do the trick.
1775 2018-05-29 21:06:23 No one other than the oil merchants..(psg and city) 
1776 2018-05-29 21:06:19 I went and got oil and an oil filter did my vehicle and it was $58 and the dude gave it to me for $28. I don’t know what he did or why he did it but god bless him for lowering the price 
1777 2018-05-29 21:06:14 Julie Newmar (aka Catwoman)
1778 2018-05-29 21:06:14 Oil should be there too. We should be up for modelling change with a Norway-style licensing scheme to include direct involvement in oil company boards and a higher financial return for the country.

1780 2018-05-29 21:06:08 I was cooking the other day and poured oil on the pan and it popped and hit my face and I'm prob just never cooking again bc it left a terrible burn :')

Me: ok

ISS: Hey Jordan, wanna go take the truck to get an oil change and inspection? 
Me: fuck yeah get me outta this hoe (throws papers I was just given)
1783 2018-05-29 21:05:59 Tip of the Day: Grapeseed Oil is lightweight and full of antioxidants, making it ideal for pre-sunscreen hydration. As we get closer to the beach days.... Grapeseed Oil should be on your skincare list, it’s infused with Vitamin E and is actually thought to reduce clogged pores.

1786 2018-05-29 21:05:27 $4.5B on a project that KM was happy to relinquish. $10.5B (ESTIMATE!) to construct. No clear explanation how royalties are to accrue to BC, nor who will pay for the inevitable oil spill in BC's waters. A dirty, inefficient, dwindling resource that's increasing our CO2 footprint.
1787 2018-05-29 21:05:10 I made $12.00 an hour 10 years ago..I bet his breaking the Iran deal are up you $5.00 raise.. it’s not effecting the billion dollar oil and gas investors..
1788 2018-05-29 21:05:10 You need to have a plate to put your dipped item on as the oil keeps the chocolate very very runny so small bits of banana, strawberry, marshmallow on a cocktail stick or skewer don’t need to be double dipped . The mess and the oil are the problem
1789 2018-05-29 21:05:05 *hot oil treatments
1790 2018-05-29 21:04:51 Yeah it does. Also put some castor oil in your hair. Hot treatments and deep conditioning
1791 2018-05-29 21:04:45 Instead of catching up on sleep I woke up early on my half day to get an oil change and now it's time to get ready for work. 
1792 2018-05-29 21:04:35 This is last pipeline project-will only be sold to a Canadian. Need to be a controlling part of oil industry to lead Global conversion, on how to switch over to Green Industry Era! If You have answers on how to make this profitably happen now, I am all ears! PEACE! I feel You!

1794 2018-05-29 21:04:19 Dear Mouth-breather,
     Gas prices always go up on this past holiday and trend through the Summer months.
     Pay attention, it goes down around the time school starts and spikes during colder winters (heating oil).
     Your special, you get two thumbs up! :)
1795 2018-05-29 21:04:14 The whole point is to put money into the research to come up with polymers that can very well replace oil based plastics, alongside banning billions and billions of single-use items and training people so they don't rely destructive ind's to feed their families
1796 2018-05-29 21:04:12 Hazel
1797 2018-05-29 21:04:06 You are still limited in your thinking,  is it only car that use oil.?????
1798 2018-05-29 21:03:36 Dude
1799 2018-05-29 21:03:23 Go and search who established kpogdcl? Who started exploration of gas and oil . Who started pedo Pukhtoonkhwa energy development organization .
1800 2018-05-29 21:03:20 A smart way to handle things would be to force oil companies to produce a small % of renewable energy and increase that amount every so often. Until it reaches 100%. Simply discouraged any kind of private energy investment is dumb.
1801 2018-05-29 21:03:20 But the KM oil will not go into BC cars and industry.
1802 2018-05-29 21:03:08 Today’s announcement did NOT ensure new jobs or full market price for Alberta oil. It only ensures another corporation has lost confidence in Canada’s business environment and taxpayers are stuck with the costs.
1803 2018-05-29 21:03:06 At a meeting with BC Tourism stakeholders today - We are asking ourselves: Why doesn’t the government doesn’t throw money at our industry like they do to oil and gas? #bcpoli #abpoli #cndpoli #StopKM
1804 2018-05-29 21:03:02 What kind of prayer though? 
1805 2018-05-29 21:03:00 Then if you truly want to move on ,cut all ties ,block her and put her number on black list shikenan no calls...if not just go back and resolve things .
1806 2018-05-29 21:02:57 Let it sit out for a while and get to slightly below room temp, take some bread, toast it, drizzle it w olive oil, slap a slice of prosciutto on it, then spread the cheese on top. 

You’re welcome.
1807 2018-05-29 21:02:43 I'd like to meet someone who prefers their canned tuna to be in vegetable oil instead of water.

1813 2018-05-29 21:02:30 #cdnpoli #onpoli @JustinTrudeau just delivered billions of tax payer dollars to an American oil giant. Another example of how capitalists use the state to manage their affairs. An example of the #ColonialPresent. . #StopKindarMorgan

1821 2018-05-29 21:01:26 Hey there - just sent you a more in a DM, but as a primary rule, steel surfaces should be cleaned of any contamination like rust, oil, grease, or mill scale. We do recommend type S6 like SpoolArc 86 rather than an S3 wire, because higher Mn and Si will help to clean the metal.

1855 2018-05-29 20:59:36 Well...the way they talk about sunscreen usage these days, it seems like just walking out in the sun will cause harm...so I am pretty sure with the years in my youth where  I  purposely baked for hours using everything from baby oil to butter, I'm f*cked.
1856 2018-05-29 20:59:35 Guy, dump this girl and keep it moving. She sound very much like another Maryam sanda
1857 2018-05-29 20:59:34 Same day as double-hulled oil/chemical tanker headed to Sarnia strands in St. Lawrence @JustinTrudeau govt announces they're buying a pipeline that will increase tanker traffic in BC by 5x. Luckily there was no leak, this time.

1860 2018-05-29 20:59:31 Again, I get that, theoretically. But the body politic in Canada is not ready to go there at that rate at this time. Its not abt the oil, it's about the ability of a democracy to withstand a shock and maintain course politically.
1861 2018-05-29 20:59:30 Like an adult, I got my oil changed today.
1862 2018-05-29 20:59:28 ... shit .. we better start using the oil of olay !!! 
1863 2018-05-29 20:59:21 That is a logical explanation.
1864 2018-05-29 20:59:18 At work i got hit with the “yo we have leftover items, take as much as you want”. Like I don’t like pizza like that but I ended up coming home with 5 frozen pizzas, black socks,a boat load of olive oil, beef jerky and a pack of angus hot dogs.

1865 2018-05-29 20:59:17 How much oil??
1866 2018-05-29 20:59:10 PLease eat you think that make me peri he make me peri EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume i will eat you
1867 2018-05-29 20:59:01 Right? Water AND oil. Win win. Hes  a genius. I repent of ever doubting him
1868 2018-05-29 20:59:00 She was hot, dude.
1869 2018-05-29 20:58:56 47. We  have also subsidized fertilizers and we have given oil palm & cocoa seedlings to farmers all over the State. Other projects include the Akwa Prime Hatchery, which produces 10,000 day old chicks   weekly,

1870 2018-05-29 20:58:55 Always a media black out when it comes to truthtelling, especially about their favorite ideological group whose oil money pays well.
1871 2018-05-29 20:58:34 Who sell oil for pens?
1872 2018-05-29 20:58:31 She's just bitter
1873 2018-05-29 20:58:10 Canadians put their trust in JT Liberals who put a documented liar and servient of oil company in a post who is spending unauthorised tax money in harm way to buy a pipeline which has been put in Canadian and specially BC lands illegally.
1874 2018-05-29 20:58:08 Every Province,Municipality  and township should be tabling plans NOW. it will take 15 20 years to allow homeowner and the private sector to implement  changes.2030 is only 17 years away, yet we are not even close to getting off oil in the public and federal  sectors.

1876 2018-05-29 20:58:05 US policies in Central and South America continue to deny the people there the right to choose their own leaders, especially if those leaders have the GALL to believe their Oil belongs to them.

1877 2018-05-29 20:58:04 Make your own halloumi fries guys! Just chop up halloumi into fries and pop them in the frying pan with oil! Done job
1878 2018-05-29 20:57:51 Fracked wells change the rules.  It's like having a bunch of shut in old school wells you can easily bring back online.  Just costs more.  Oil is also less important in the global energy portfolio.
1879 2018-05-29 20:57:50 Hahahaha!
1880 2018-05-29 20:57:49 I like that you look after your bike. I saw his and thought, that's the tool of his trade right there and no oil.
1881 2018-05-29 20:57:39 Better get to them quick before they are over charged, strip mined, logged, with a scenic oil well or two, or sold off to help pay for a Repub election Campaign
1882 2018-05-29 20:57:39 I was about to ask if you wanted to do that glittery baby oil thing for your skin for asra but then I remembered you're allergic to the entire planet so nvm
1883 2018-05-29 20:57:38 Natural hazards...like an oil spill for example in the ANWR?
1884 2018-05-29 20:57:37 Well his father liked to nationalise oil . Where the he'll did Petri Canada come from.
1885 2018-05-29 20:57:35 * BLOCKED *
1886 2018-05-29 20:57:32 The federal government caused this to fail so they could get into the oil buisness all on the premise of "I'm sorry." This was on purpose. KM out, feds in to save the day. Yeah right
1887 2018-05-29 20:57:28 The one's that have good genes will tell you to rub coconut oil on your skin the most. Don't do it.
1888 2018-05-29 20:57:27 it was a 40 min service...

For larger things i can get a loaner but for an oil change it's a waste of time

1892 2018-05-29 20:56:58 I thought i was the only one who noticed...i always put a thin layer of baby oil on after i do my makeup
1893 2018-05-29 20:56:50 Many people who are extremely upset about our federal government propping up a Texan #oilandgas company would rather see $5B put into setting up @Tesla gigafactories so we can store renewable energy, bypass pricey peaker companies, save money, and ditch majority of our oil need.
1894 2018-05-29 20:56:48 You do recall that the US supported Iran in the 1970s? They supplied arms for oil discounts & protected the nation against Iraq. If you know the history, you'll understand that US policy then switched to funding Saddam Hussein's Iraq after the Islamic Revolution of 1979. The 1/2
1895 2018-05-29 20:56:43 You know what's more epic than bacon? Putting bacon on bacon and wrapping it in bacon and cooking it in bacon oil.
1896 2018-05-29 20:56:22 John Krasinski.
1897 2018-05-29 20:56:19 So since oil prices are now down to 70  to 75 USD a barrel and might go down more based on Saudi and Russia deciding to pump more will our fuel prices go down? As it’s gone up thrice already #NewGambia
1898 2018-05-29 20:56:08 45.  Determined to
 diversify our economy form overdependence on oil, we have made huge gains in agriculture. To date, work is on-going in the following projects: the 11,000 hectares coconut plantation; and 16,000 hectares cassava plantation in 15 LGA’s.

1901 2018-05-29 20:55:49 Jojoba oil is the most amazing thing I’ve ever used on my skin!!!
1902 2018-05-29 20:55:46 Of course, oil sands emissions are still likely higher than most alternatives (and requires more emissions in upgrading somewhere), so we’d need to bump that back up. This needs more rigour yet, but roughly, we’re talking closer to 5MT than 15.9MT
1903 2018-05-29 20:55:41 I'm sure if Doug Ford cuts the gas tax that oil companies won't just increase the price in response. They'll surely allow their customers to have some relief. I mean, it's not all about money for them. Right?
1904 2018-05-29 20:55:35 Regardless of the cannabis oil, should the NCAA allow someone who is susceptible to seizures play a game where he slams his head into things regularly?
1905 2018-05-29 20:55:25 40 years AT LEAST. My daughter in law did the core sampling. THERE ARE YEARS AND YEARS OF OIL LEFT! And technology is making it possible to get it now. So - oil will be a boon & Scotgov already talking about an oil fund. Invested - that will make us a good, rounded economy.
1906 2018-05-29 20:55:25 Just follow your heart bro.
1907 2018-05-29 20:55:10 Auburn doesn't want a walk-on with epilepsy - a brain condition - playing a sport where your head is used to initiate contact.  AU can choose who they accept to walk onto the team, for any reason. The cannabis oil angle is a red herring. AU did nothing at all wrong.
1908 2018-05-29 20:54:55 A little vegetable oil might have done the trick too.

1911 2018-05-29 20:54:45 You should be soaked in hot oil for this statement
1912 2018-05-29 20:54:44 I too have Chrons which led to cancer stage 3 of small bowels and I give the CBD oil to my mother for her cancer and vertigo. It's harmless and contains no thc. This is damn shame.
1913 2018-05-29 20:54:39 When they are sitting at the national cake table, all complexities disappear. When they are awarding contracts and oil blocks, no complexities. When they are not prosecuting party men, no complexities. Give power, education, good road, security, food, complexities everywhere.
1914 2018-05-29 20:54:33 Or we can stop sending them to needless wars fought for oil.
1915 2018-05-29 20:54:32 PSA use coconut oil instead of butter. I know I’m late but it’s fucking good
1916 2018-05-29 20:54:27 Happy accident is that is is quite effective in treating IBS as well. I can't cape,  so do you sell this brand in sublingual oil?
1917 2018-05-29 20:54:18 Higher dollar, interest rates, oil and inflation are the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse to the stock market.  You throw in China and Italy?
1918 2018-05-29 20:54:17 “Tweeps” he said.
1919 2018-05-29 20:54:01 Medical marijuana saved my life. It kept me off opioids post surgery and has greatly improved my mental illness. Its a shame this young man has to give up CBD oil, which is legal btw and doesnt even produce the high.
1920 2018-05-29 20:53:58 Usa will be biggest oil producer in world in few years..second or third at mo..
Fracking has helped..
Here in Uk.we have more than enough gas...but as usual we fuck about.

1922 2018-05-29 20:53:46 I’m just a little skeptical of trying CBD oil again. My Pharmacist said the brand they sell is untraceable THC, yet here I sit in substance abuse classes fighting for my job.
1923 2018-05-29 20:53:42 He wants to magically establish a moon colony with zero funding or directive and then drill it for oil? 
Sorry, can't find an appropriate emoji. #resist
1924 2018-05-29 20:53:28 John Horgan is listening to the people. Twisty Christy got her payoff and turned on the people of this province. She made this mess, she allowed BC Ferries to pay million dollar salaries, she siphoned monies from Hydro and ICBC. Oil offered big money to put more in the coffers

1926 2018-05-29 20:53:15 They don't even talk about Niger Delta Avengers destruction of Oil pipelines at the early stage of the administration and the loss to the economy that was already looted by PDP thieves, if only they knew the damage done to the economy by these PDP thugs despite the low oil price.
1927 2018-05-29 20:53:04 lol me too, but i bought 4 things, they were supposed to be sent in one package, and they only sent me my oil.

which is kinda understandable cuz they were ordered at different times, but i /paid/ money to get them shipped together.
1928 2018-05-29 20:53:03 Next time put olive oil 
1929 2018-05-29 20:53:02 This Marketing strategy is for politicians, more so than the economy. And to piss Trump off as well, because he doesn’t want to make a deal, so the oil is being sold to China for a decent price.
1930 2018-05-29 20:52:53 The Provinces collect a royalty on the resource extracted by private enterprise.  The oil in these pipelines is privately owned and a toll is paid to transport the product.
1931 2018-05-29 20:52:43 I just found out that dish soap removes oil stains, even if they’re old. #LifeChangingHack #SavedMyFavoriteDress #HappyGirl

1934 2018-05-29 20:52:36 @CurtisJavonHar5 I take CBD oil for an inner ear disorder, and it has 0% THC (Just released). If this finds its way to you, I’ll send you a free bottle to use. #LetCJPlay
1935 2018-05-29 20:52:30 Educated people are aware that hydraulic fracturing to acquire shale oil destroys the earth's crust, causes earthquakes, and contaminates water tables with deadly pollutants.  @murdo_fraser
1936 2018-05-29 20:52:28 Wife was getting her car's oil changed this weekend. Lady next to her alternated between classical music and Spanish rap.
1937 2018-05-29 20:52:27 Try roast çherry toms with garlic  & chilli flakes with olive oil . Salt & pepper. Gas 5 say 30 mins. Cook pasta shells separately . Mix all together top with grated parmesan plus French bread to mop up juices.  Red wine compulsory. 
1938 2018-05-29 20:52:18 Like seriously no tangible reason,n she initiated the break up when I went fr mid semester break,I lost my mind
1939 2018-05-29 20:52:15 When you Oil, it go in.
When you Piss, it go out.
1940 2018-05-29 20:52:13 I’m mad at myself for not managing my car better. I was gonna have my dad change it after work but then I checked the oil life & it was 4% & I panicked and came to Jiffy lube on my lunch. $80 later my car running smooth. 
1941 2018-05-29 20:52:02 ใดๆในโลกที่บอกว่า oil free ใช้ไปก็หน้ามันอยู่ดี ไม่ได้ผิดที่ครีม ผิดที่หน้ากูเอง
1942 2018-05-29 20:51:55 @JustinTrudeau PM Trudeau who can't manage a hot dog stand properly has spent 4.5 billion taxpayer dollars to buy a pipeline, then spend billions more twinning that  pipeline.Billions of oil resource investment money has left Canada because of the Liberals.
1943 2018-05-29 20:51:43 What's the difference between Piss and Oil?
1944 2018-05-29 20:51:31 That was the quickest oil change ever
1945 2018-05-29 20:51:26 So, how about explaining how u will improve us being treated with respect & fairness for simply LIVING in our own country & undoing this outrageous pipeline deal? Because throwing 4.5 BILLION dollars of MY tax money at dirty, big oil is the exact opposite of this
1946 2018-05-29 20:51:26 Lougheed bailed out oil as well, he then sold the stocks,My dad had stocks that ended up being worth a lot of money. Hope JT does that here.
1947 2018-05-29 20:51:24 When i say a dry oil?!?! I’ve never had a dry oil that was honestly true to name
1948 2018-05-29 20:51:22 What always helps me when my allergy pills aren't working is lavender and pine oil. It's meant for headaches but I find it kinda clears out my nose hole and lets me get over the attack faster
1949 2018-05-29 20:51:22 I gave our chocolate fountain away as you had to pour about a litre of vegetable oil in with the chocolate #eeergh
1950 2018-05-29 20:51:21 Uhmmmm this one is strong o... If u have moved on then tell her to get a hobby after all she left you without a tangible reason I presume
1951 2018-05-29 20:51:19 You know what it is, spreading hate and intolerance, causing division and fighting over oil land and money all are wrong that participate!
1952 2018-05-29 20:51:13 How do I PR request a lifetime supply of rosehip oil
1953 2018-05-29 20:51:12 We  have also subsidized fertilizers and we have given oil palm & cocoa seedlings to farmers all over the State. Other projects include the Akwa Prime Hatchery, which produces 10,000 day old chicks   weekly, the cultivation of over 100 hectares of rice. #UdomEmmanuelat3
1954 2018-05-29 20:51:11 Yes that’s all I use is olive oil shampoo and conditioner and it’s changed my life
1955 2018-05-29 20:51:11 Told my dad I liked the show because I thought the big bald guy was funny.  He was, but that wasn’t the reason. 
1956 2018-05-29 20:51:10 I could never date a girl with a severe nut allergy. I don’t discriminate, I just use way too much Coconut oil lol
1957 2018-05-29 20:51:08 Wasn't gas prices suppose to go down Mr. Trump? We are drilling now and getting gasoline independent so why are we giving Big Oil such big profits.
1958 2018-05-29 20:50:58 Aye can somebody put me on some good beard oil or beard products ?
1959 2018-05-29 20:50:50 I spilled an entire jar of coconut oil on the microphone...
1960 2018-05-29 20:50:49 A5. Grilled chicken! Or steak! With a simple rub before the grill. Then brushed with olive oil. Tasty. #PantryChat
1961 2018-05-29 20:50:36 Just its authority. That’s all. Alberta needs no help getting its oil to market. All it needs is the Federal Government to uphold the law and constitution. That’s it. That’s all

1963 2018-05-29 20:50:33 I think you are not allies with countries, because of their moral behaviour, but because you need them to help your interests get done in the middle east and ofcourse because of the oil you need from them. If USA would loose SA as an ally in that region it would be a catastrophy

1967 2018-05-29 20:50:12 2/2  They waited to take advantage to nationalize this project and now can put a choke hold on exports from the oil sands....a vital driver of Alberta's and Canada's economy.
1968 2018-05-29 20:50:10 Energy East was withdrawn by TransCanada because Keystone got approved. The price of oil has also been too low to justify Energy East, which would have been a more expensive pipeline to use compared to Keystone.
1969 2018-05-29 20:50:09 Why did I just barely find out about baby oil gel!?
1970 2018-05-29 20:50:03 The oil sands wouldn’t need a taxpayer bailout if it wasn’t for the BC government interference. The money was all going to be put forward by private investors that got fed up with government blockades. I don’t like the Tar Sands, but you are being disingenuous.
1971 2018-05-29 20:50:02 Haven't heard Horgan or Weaver mention tanker cars of oil traversing the banks of the Fraser River. The pipeline would be safer. Elizabeth May thinks a derailment into the Fraser is safer than a pipeline. Nutters all of them. You cannot clean oil from a raging river.
1972 2018-05-29 20:50:01 If the pipeline is so important to move oil from the oil sands, then why didn’t Suncor, CNRL, Cenovus, Husky and Imperial Oil step up to buy the pipeline?

1974 2018-05-29 20:49:58 @sebastiancomedy ok, I'm still catching up on the 'cast.  Lana's essential oils  are all the rage right now. You should ask her for some oil for some of your issues and report on the show. @mycorreale, go make him do it. Dare you.

1977 2018-05-29 20:49:41 Right? You have all the freedom that comes with ruling a small country and its plentiful oil fields and you waste it on a silver and black Rolls? No thanks.
1978 2018-05-29 20:49:37 Oil industry as we know has at least a 50 year future. Sunset seems a long way off. 

Green Energy Indusdry in its infancy and right now does much more harm than good.
1979 2018-05-29 20:49:32 O, dawg!
1980 2018-05-29 20:49:24 While getting an oil change at Walmart I decided just to get a job there and save for a new car. It takes less time. #walmart #100,000miles #cantrollbackmytime
1981 2018-05-29 20:49:21 No more words about this inept government!Every country on earth is scrambling trying to get every drop of oil still available, here in Canada we have plenty of oil but this inept government doesn't want us to use any of it against will and logic..No more....
1982 2018-05-29 20:49:21 Everytime I go in for an oil change I feel like I'm in trouble
1983 2018-05-29 20:49:18 Tourism alone can pull Nigeria out of the doldrums of economic difficulties.
But her lazy government is busy digging the grounds for Oils while abandoning the gifts of nature that can earn her triple what Oil will.

1986 2018-05-29 20:49:07 Apparently (rumor has it) it was the CBD oil commercials. I've seen some other #YouTube channels running them. Better safe than sorry because I don't think YT is going to give on this one bit (legal reasons I guess).

1991 2018-05-29 20:48:34 So disregard player safety then?? Because that’s what the issue is, not the fact that he was using cannabis oil. If you yourself had a child with a history of childhood seizures, would you let them play football?

2001 2018-05-29 20:47:54 it looks like they are all out of snake oil at the moment, but they do have some "male vitality pills" and some other overprices nonsense.
2002 2018-05-29 20:47:51 $120 later I’ll have my oil changed and a clean battery 
2003 2018-05-29 20:47:45 Color with metallic or oil based Sharpies?
2004 2018-05-29 20:47:43 Just read my timeline. Plenty of good ideas there on moving away from oil including investing in green transportation choices including electric rail, buses and walk on ferries as well as cycling and walking.
2005 2018-05-29 20:47:35 Perfectly said!
2006 2018-05-29 20:47:30 I just heard nails run down a chalkboard in my head.

2008 2018-05-29 20:47:21 Still waiting to hear about meds from elevator incident. Trying CBD oil for now as it works for a friend's anxiety. Not sure if it'll do the same, take time to kick in, tho it seems to be quick to absorb. Bit pricey, $20 droplet. Hasn't stopped the screaming yet, have to see...
2009 2018-05-29 20:47:13 As someone said, I'd hit that so hard that whosoever pulled me out would be rightly crowned king of England.

2011 2018-05-29 20:46:57 OK. Muted.
2012 2018-05-29 20:46:55 Out of work early, getting my oil changed ; it’s a great day
2013 2018-05-29 20:46:47 True… but those jobs are just as valid as these oil jobs they keep talking about and the results are better for our climate…
2014 2018-05-29 20:46:45 You are a fool. Stupid liar so for 5 yrs oil was 100 dollars? You mumu's have lied so much you now believe it to be true..well last time I checked your God who you call his name atleast twice a day isn't running in the next elections. So it's all about boohari dumb fuck

2017 2018-05-29 20:46:39 Try using a home made one. Coconut oil and coffee works great!  Apart from exfoliating, the caffeine is an added perk for your skin 
2018 2018-05-29 20:46:27 Glow set = Any of the extreme glow soaps, glow lotion and glow oil. With this combo, your glow will blind your enemies. Lol. Stay woke!
2019 2018-05-29 20:46:27 "I'll definitely think about it Ms. Kanna. After all i wouldn't miss an occasion to really cause some damage.

Maybe even drown someone in said oil while its boiling hot."
2020 2018-05-29 20:46:20 Nope, we are definitely lower than that, but I would say listings here are about twice what they were ten years ago. The oil boom jumped it up and hasn't let go.
2021 2018-05-29 20:46:15 Because the government doesn't own everything else. The government *does* own the oil. And pipelines are infrastructure, like roads and parks.
2022 2018-05-29 20:46:14 Not one oil lamp in the picture though!
2023 2018-05-29 20:46:00 Agreed. The more I watch and remember, Magnum (the character) was really a good guy (sure he had his quirks) which is probably why my parents allowed me to watch the program.
2024 2018-05-29 20:45:49 Creaming? For sure, that emulsification is obviously important, but adding coconut oil to the powder for storage seems new to me. Though I may be misunderstanding what's going on here.

2026 2018-05-29 20:45:38 Just mixed this stuff with engine oil
2027 2018-05-29 20:45:28 Albertans, because of a decision Notley made. As for 100$ a barrel even I don’t see that happening. Gas prices are sky rocketed as it is right now. So to balance the gas prices/ lower them out they would have to take the price of oil and bring it down.
2028 2018-05-29 20:45:28 The Black Liberals want to boil her in oil but they’ll cosy up to Farrakhan who wants to go back to burning the Jewish.
2029 2018-05-29 20:45:27 I’ve got them both. Allows me to see races at tracks that I would never be able to make it to. If WOO or Lucas Oil is at a driveable Track for me I’m there.

2033 2018-05-29 20:44:50 Says the everglowing! 
I keep it simple daily; cleanse moisturize. Use a home made scrub two days a week and a hydrating mask over the weekend usually. Total sucker for natural homemade stuff and coconut oil 
2034 2018-05-29 20:44:46 @RealAlexJones @newsmax @NewsmaxTV 

I would suggest a weekly series that compares a real US liberal with actual events in Venezuela.  Healthcare, food, banking, insurance, mortgages, medicine, cities, farms, oil, cars, etc
2035 2018-05-29 20:44:44 I'm over ooo
2036 2018-05-29 20:44:41 If for people who said why rich ? Well u go buy me a month supply of alkaline water and pure coconut oil and coconut water to bathe in and tell me how much it costs
2037 2018-05-29 20:44:37 Yeah but you'd need to muzzle that yap.
2038 2018-05-29 20:44:36 Back in KC and on my last day off I’m running errands, now time to get an oil change!
2039 2018-05-29 20:44:33 i like: 
-cosrx good morning gel cleanser (w/ hadalabo gokujun cleansing oil for makeup days)
-biore UV aqua rich watery essence for sunscreen
-kikumasamune sake skin lotion (pink for dry skin, white for oily [i think???] smells strongly of booze)

(the rest is mizon snails)
2040 2018-05-29 20:44:31 easily my favorite contempo online snake oil is this "CEO's [sic] spend 80% of their free time reading" "Twix's CEO Dildon Nougätt Demands You Read These 5 Genius Biz Books and Report Back on How Justifiable His Wealth Is"

2044 2018-05-29 20:44:15 Different things work on different hair types. Coconut oil dries my hair up. I use Jamaican Castor Oil.
2045 2018-05-29 20:44:10 Mustard keeps oil and water based stuff like vinegar together. At least 2-1 oil-vinegar ratio and whisk together with mustard results in creamy goodness. Dressing without mustard only holds together for a short time.

I spent so long believing that I couldn’t do art and that the creative skills I have weren’t of value (because stitching isn’t real art, like oil painting or something) and then I just have up on that because it’s boring and making stuff is fun.

2049 2018-05-29 20:44:00 Tankers stuffed with oil have been leaving the Port of Vancouver for - what? — 50 years now. So far so good. And I  hope it will be in the future.

2062 2018-05-29 20:43:03 Chaos in the Middle East drives up oil prices and if you're Putin, yes, you are winning bigly. Trump's dumping the Iran nuclear accord and moving our Israeli embassy to Jerusalem gifted this win to puppet master Vlad. Almost certainly by design.
2063 2018-05-29 20:42:58 Hey #MAGA people Are you feeling used yet… NO OK so you have drank the Snake oil because now you’ll have to see that you are not good people, everything your mama taught you is not what you’re doing

2065 2018-05-29 20:42:43 If I was rich I would only drink alkaline water and bathe in coconut oil and water. Those two things are LIFE for ur body and skin. Period. I don’t need no other remedies.

2073 2018-05-29 20:42:26 Yes, a great amount of people tend to blame everyone else for their failures. In venezuela's case, the supporters of this catastrophe blame the US and the oil prices when in reality the blame it's mainly  in the failed state policies that have been imposed by force.

2075 2018-05-29 20:42:16 Agreed that currently need oil, but if youre going to use #wakeup please recognize that it isnt a sustainable ground pillar of our society and we will at some point have to make efforts to get off it. I get your position but we are leaving the next gen high & dry

2081 2018-05-29 20:41:49 it's all a game , they are probably producing less crude oil so the prices will go up because of summer demand , who really know , they could also be using Syria as an excuse , it's all a fucking game because summer is here and people drive more , it will go down by sept.
2082 2018-05-29 20:41:44 Lol ok back to the main thing... You guys need closure... you need to talk about it...... Revisiting the issue doesn't really mean you have to continue dating but maybe it will help her move on...

2084 2018-05-29 20:41:41 it’s in the article if you read it. cbd oil doesn’t even have thc in it, it’s a different component but bc it’s cannabis based they refused to let him play unless he stops the treatment which then he will get seizures again.
2085 2018-05-29 20:41:36 What if a hipster beard oil company wants to rent from Garth?
2086 2018-05-29 20:41:34 But what is the true cost, factor in poisoned tailing ponds, oil spills, risk to climate. The price tag soars before it gets to market.

2092 2018-05-29 20:41:01 I’m so impatient that I was thinking about paying $80 for my oil change so I didn’t have to wait forever
2093 2018-05-29 20:40:57 he recieved unemployment from leaving his last job from the pain it caused his breaking cracking skin that was covered in corn based oil daily, this apparently was deemed not a good reason to have quit.

2098 2018-05-29 20:40:19 Dems will also raise 45's taxes and i hope they go up 1000 fold to make up for all the money 45 and his family have gotten from their likely corruption. And I hope they build an oil rig 10 feet from Mar-a-lago and have a major leak that shuts down his resort.
2099 2018-05-29 20:40:12 If you would asked for $10 Billion for refinery at it’s source, I would’ve approved that, and so would the rest of BC and then refined oil has a market everywhere.

THAT is why they are outraged bc he found a solution, just not one they like.
2113 2018-05-29 20:39:16 Flour, yeast, water in coconut oil, sugar/cinomon/honey after to suit taste. Done.
2114 2018-05-29 20:39:15  youth serum? The new  oil, presumably?
2115 2018-05-29 20:39:14 Agree with you on Saudi and Yemen. The Tory PR machine is disgusting.

Yes, there was known oil off Argentina. Still seems to have been speculative over Falklands though. Have learned about cretaceous reservoirs.
2116 2018-05-29 20:39:07 Ain't nothing gonna help except exfoliation, so don't spend your money on all those products.  Whirl 8oz of everclear and 23 plain aspirin in the blender and use that as toner/peel under a light oil moisturizer.  Works for razor bumps too, and costs pennies.
2117 2018-05-29 20:39:06 People put coconut oil on their face? In 2018?

2135 2018-05-29 20:37:46 Yes, and the oil industry has been happy to receive Liberal government help in the past - this will be the fourth time by my count. Including the original/existing TM pipeline, which was created by the federal Liberal government to serve Leduc.

2139 2018-05-29 20:37:24 I've dealt with it before, usually meditation and CBD oil helps a lot
2140 2018-05-29 20:37:21 it's that time of year again...my coconut oil is all melted now
2141 2018-05-29 20:37:20 Sounds like you'd like Dandan noodles too. Its basically dry noodles with sesame paste, chili oil, and ground pork. Lots of variations too so you can add/mix anything you want!

They have not put product out into the marketplace, and after speaking with them myself over the weekend, they are having excess fish waste issues, not us!
2144 2018-05-29 20:36:52 ! my fav was the YSL touche eclat (i always get the little free sample bottles now) but my current winter foundation is Kat Von D lock it mixed w a couple drops of rosehip oil for a dewier look!
2145 2018-05-29 20:36:52 Y’all tell me when your man text you that he is done changing the oil in your car ..
2146 2018-05-29 20:36:51 Crude #oil has dropped in recent days by the prospect of increased OPEC production, #WTI, the US benchmark. has been falling more than #Brent: a surprising divergence, as Brent is more exposed than WTI to higher production in Russia and Saudi Arabia.

2157 2018-05-29 20:36:11 Oh that's not true, even @stephenharper was trying to unload tarsands projects because they cost too much to get dirty oil to market so they aren't profitable. $5B could have bought us a #Tesla gigafactory. #renewables
2158 2018-05-29 20:36:10 have you used CBD oil for it before?
2159 2018-05-29 20:36:04 If this ever happens to anyone else use a bit of cooking oil.

2174 2018-05-29 20:34:58 However Alberta runs on an oil based economy, that’s what Alberta’s known for. For those who haven’t been working for years because of this economic decline that Notley has put us in then there wouldn’t be the result of that pipeline being created in the first place.

2176 2018-05-29 20:34:51 Where is that? Might be my sisters
2177 2018-05-29 20:34:41 I'm wondering if it's a backdoor play for nationalizing the oil sector. His old man was in favour of that.
2178 2018-05-29 20:34:38 Canadians in other parts of the country should be thankful the pipeline is being built.  Without an oil and gas industry Canada would be bankrupt.
2179 2018-05-29 20:34:37 But Democrats do right? Ur an idiot. Trump's foreign policy sets oil prices. You guys can't even condemn one of his bad policies. Everything has to be great or Trump does it, even if it means your food, energy, shipping, taxes and gas prices goes up.
2180 2018-05-29 20:34:31 But fuel is not the only product from petroleum. A thousand other products could be made from oil. That's why its called refinery and Petrochemical's company.

2183 2018-05-29 20:34:10 I need to see an oil painting of this.
2184 2018-05-29 20:34:07 Yeah I do know what it is.  Trump is the very definition of an empty suit who sells snake oil.  Which is why trump stopped building and instead licensed his name since he was failing.  Trump never accomplished anything without his dad handing him millions.
2185 2018-05-29 20:34:07 There are metal shavings/debris from the crankshaft that could get caught in the passing of the oil causing the engine to lock up while driving it
2186 2018-05-29 20:34:06 I’ve been applying coconut oil on mine over time you’ll notice a difference but takes long . It better than before lol
2187 2018-05-29 20:34:04 FUCK BIG OIL JOBS!!! It's a dying, polluting industry!!! INVEST IN CLEAN, RENEWABLE ENERGY TO CREATE JOBS!!! U sellouts are sickening. & Alberta & BC?!? I live in ONTARIO, what about us?!? What about the rest of the country?!? I need my money, NOT them!!!
2188 2018-05-29 20:34:02 Tattoo place denied me, missed my meeting, couldn't get an oil change, now my car won't start.

2192 2018-05-29 20:33:38 You're also right and then since the major buyers of crude oil may stop buying in the near future, that makes it even more imperative for us to step up our game in refining.
2193 2018-05-29 20:33:37 Sodium hydroxide. Powerful shit. You clean drains with it. It binds to fatty acids in oil/fat which helps it flush out pipes. So basically you're making soap when you use it down the drain. But in soap making, you are controlling the oil/fats ratio.

2198 2018-05-29 20:33:12 Just bone your face guy
2199 2018-05-29 20:33:11 I can vouche for the charcoal wash and the rose hip oil. I use both and I love them. My face is clear and moisturizer but not a pizza slice. I even wash my back and chest with the charcoal bar soap that brand sells.
2200 2018-05-29 20:33:10 Not even a mention for Sears employees laid off and their pensions stolen, but @JustinTrudeau can find $4-billion to buy an oil pipeline.

2204 2018-05-29 20:33:03 Well isn’t that what happens when a car doesn’t have oil?

2217 2018-05-29 20:32:24 I want the pipeline but it’s a little strange for the government of Canada to shell out $4.5B on a project that was supposed to funded wholly with private sector funds. State ownership of oil infrastructure is reminiscent of the Soviet countries.

2255 2018-05-29 20:29:42 Last estimate I saw for cost of an upgrader to allow a Cdn refinery to handle bitumen was $1B per 50,000 bpd. So just to eliminate eastern Cda imported oil (~750,000bpd), that’s $15B...plus the Energy East pipeline to transport it...another $15B. $30B total. Plus operating costs

2259 2018-05-29 20:29:24 Your government used the oil money for ghost projects not knowing it was used to buy votes by the @JDMahama administration; @NAkufoAddo has come to use the oil money to fund a policy which seeks to benefit all and you going to court..!!.. ‘wise’ people go to court

2275 2018-05-29 20:28:10 Just Gawd awful! Is this the beginning of another Trudeau's attempt to nationalize oil industry
2276 2018-05-29 20:28:04 hehe it was funny driving it in. Smoke and oil was going everywhere. XD
2277 2018-05-29 20:28:01 Ai just think of the reason she left you, if you think that reason will come up again, then forget her. If not if you think she’s worth it then try.
2278 2018-05-29 20:28:00 Their concerns that loss of Venezuelan and Iranian production could spike oil to $100 and kill off global growth engines in China and India outweighed their fear of “talk” dropping price by $5 for a spell.
2279 2018-05-29 20:27:59 And they still are gonna blame oil prices I'm sure...even as they continue to rise.
2280 2018-05-29 20:27:58 Girl hell no! I wish your dealership did something like Honda when you can bring your car in for an oil change and it’s like $30
2281 2018-05-29 20:27:57 Hurts them in bc and with anti oil. Doesn't help them with pro oil. No upside that i can see
2282 2018-05-29 20:27:55 Comparable to the Harper Conservative government bailout of the auto sector? Or Lougheeds original support of Syncrude and the oil sands? Ok then wasn’t it?
2283 2018-05-29 20:27:50 I try as hard as I can to live my values, reduce my dependence on oil / plastic / etc. but the point is that individual actions mean nothing when our government makes a deal that will send 30% of the total allowable amount of carbon under the paris climate accord into the air.

2293 2018-05-29 20:26:59 The West owns all the gold & oil anywhere in the world. They come to you, force you to privatise in order to induce "efficiency". They buy up & control all your assets.
2294 2018-05-29 20:26:56 " It is appalling to think that
        the Media spent so much
       time blasting oil companies
       when you have owners like
       Bezos, Gates etc. working
       hard to accumulate such a
                              large nestegg

         and there's more......!
2295 2018-05-29 20:26:51 Muted, blocked, reported, doxxed.
2296 2018-05-29 20:26:45 A foreign investor that was going to put 7 billion dollars in Canadian pockets to build the infrastructure to buy more of our oil at market value for as long as there is oil being produced here? Ya, that's pretty evil. Diabolical plan to steal the country out from under us. OK
2297 2018-05-29 20:26:45 My kid loved that show. I couldn't stand her irritating voice.
2298 2018-05-29 20:26:44 Actually, now that I think about that more, maybe Tom Selleck tops Bo Duke a little bit.   Magnum PI.  Hairy chest and dark hair.  Yup.
2299 2018-05-29 20:26:36 As in advice me,I'm tired,since 2014,gyal will just be troubling me

2302 2018-05-29 20:26:07 As a Westerner and a former servicemen I agree! We shouldn’t get involved in their political bollocks... Where there’s Oil, we’ll be there though...
2303 2018-05-29 20:26:00 What's your solution DRW? How would you remedy this?
2304 2018-05-29 20:25:59 Never had a TV crush.
2305 2018-05-29 20:25:58 Probably oil spilled

2308 2018-05-29 20:25:52 If you want to improve it have you tried bio oil? Personally I think they are part of you & shouldn’t be removed x
2309 2018-05-29 20:25:48 Oil production & Italy. A genuine cause behind the falling markets.
Especially, Rise in Oil price is like a Frog  jump. It sure is going to come down & also never sure on where it’s going to splash.

2311 2018-05-29 20:25:43 Its not tar. And the API of Athabasca blend is 19.6. The oil from Venezuela is heavier. Much of the Oils from Iraq, Iran, Brazil are as heavy as Athabasca.

Try again.

2314 2018-05-29 20:25:33 Yeah, America doesn't want the oil exactly, it just wants countries to sell it for dollars.
2315 2018-05-29 20:25:27 I now understand what did @JustinTrudeau meant by his promise of #sunnyways to come. That meant that we will extract so much #tarsands oil and create so much greenhouse gases that we’ll raise the temperature enough to obliterate winter and replace it with arid, sunny climate.
2316 2018-05-29 20:25:26 I couldn't agree more. Kinder Morgan never asked for a penny, so this is just another attempt by liberals to hold Canadians hostage by unnecessarily spending $40 billion for an already approved pipeline. Another Trudeaun  attempt to nationalize oil industry?
2317 2018-05-29 20:25:21 How do you soft block folks who push onto you the magical healing properties of crystals? I'm all for "alternative" medicine because I grew up in an Asian family but seriously this is snake oil that charlatans are pushing on impressionable people.
2318 2018-05-29 20:25:18 I have yet to meet a climate activist who doesn't use oil.
2319 2018-05-29 20:25:14 Sorry man, anyone who pretends they don’t use Oil & Gas products or energy in their everyday life are full of shit. At work, at home.
2320 2018-05-29 20:25:09 . Other  projects include the 21-Storey Office Complex which will house the International Oil Companies and change the skyline of Uyo metropolis; the ongoing construction of the 2nd Airport Runway and the upgrade of the Airport Main Runway to Category 2. #udomemmanuelat3
2321 2018-05-29 20:25:03 I should get an oil change with this spare time.
2322 2018-05-29 20:24:54 1: So @SenSchumer says the Rising gas prices of $2.85 are the direct fault of @POTUS beucase of his policies. Ok, i grant you that, there are things he could do to lower #gasprices such as open reserves and/or stop exporting so much oil to other countries...

2334 2018-05-29 20:24:07 Before that Elon will be removed as CEO, & there’ll be a more talk of acquisition. I think TSLA is strong despite capital issue. People forget it’s not just a car company, but is valued only as such. Also keeping an eye on oil prices & if they rise. Troubled by production delays.

2338 2018-05-29 20:23:59 Wanna do an oil change for a case of beer & a pack of smokes?
2339 2018-05-29 20:23:59 @MikeSchreiner "I want to see us get off of oil and gas” and also nuclear? Nuclear power isn’t bad for the environment. It doesn’t produce GHGs. Nuclear expansion could hasten our work on climate change.
2340 2018-05-29 20:23:56 Indeed Venezuela shows no country is entirely safe for the deadly combination of corruption and stupidity, even if it has an adundance of natural resources (more oil than SA).
2341 2018-05-29 20:23:46 I just had some yam without oil this night , and going by the way I feel right now, I have to drink some oil first thing tomorrow morning. But please can someone just assure me that I can survive till tomorrow morning, can I?

2347 2018-05-29 20:23:30 Hardly slanderous Tom but if it's happening to a perceived "clean" bio-diesel then it's a huge issue. Diesel has already many additives and now Palm Oil will bury it as an eco-fuel. Petrol is higher Co2 and EV is still compromised.

2351 2018-05-29 20:23:18 Internet is down. We have already descended into chaos. There are those fires burning in oil barrels that are everywhere for some reason.
2352 2018-05-29 20:23:16 You’re not supposed to heavily oil your hair like any oil based product. A tiny bit on your fingertips & massage it into your scalp/ends. Before bed is best.
2353 2018-05-29 20:23:15 There's plenty of oil there
2354 2018-05-29 20:23:06 Stronger dollar  impacting dollar-denominated commodities like oil, has climbed close to 10% to hover around $80 a barrel for the first time in more than 3 1/2 years.

2356 2018-05-29 20:23:05 Canada buying the #TransMountainPipeline and giving billions of dollars to Big Oil is a terrible idea. Very disappointed in the Trudeau government today.
2357 2018-05-29 20:23:04 Drained the wrong oil in bike so what should've taken 10 minutes took two hours... morale of the story: just skip vehicle maintenance, shit ain't worth it...

2359 2018-05-29 20:22:56 You work for an Australian snake oil salesman and shill for a president propped up by the Kremlin. Your use of the term globalism seems disingenuous.
2360 2018-05-29 20:22:55 The contracts for use of the pipeline have been sold to the oil companies already, pipelines don't get built without selling usage contracts first. Canadian oil is sold at discount to western texas intermediate because of pipeline constraints.
2361 2018-05-29 20:22:36 These supportive accounts are modern day snake oil peddlers. They all have some bullshit YouTube channel and verbally felate the idiot in chief on every post. Joey, that dude with securities fraud, on and on. Like pirannah tasting blood.

2364 2018-05-29 20:22:15 Here’s the thing: Jennifer Lawrence isn’t a poor. She isn’t a woman of color. To my knowledge she’s not LGBTQ. She’s not the target of police brutality. She doesn’t have to worry about her family’s gravesites being desecrated and destroyed for an oil company.
2365 2018-05-29 20:22:12 Neither does a zero emitter. They just lose billions of dollars and are challenged to provide social services. Global oil demand is not decreasing, no matter how hard you want it to.

2375 2018-05-29 20:21:41 Everything comes gradually bro. States need to develop their capacity to generate revenue without the federal government. Mind u most states are dependent on oil money. True federalism would mean that everyone should support themselves. Even with oil, most states can't pay wages

2383 2018-05-29 20:21:02 Imma look for some coconut oil soap for under my neck and see if it works I have an exfoliating brush but some times that shit be killing my skin cells so damn fast 
2384 2018-05-29 20:20:53 Coconut oil is like too thick on my pores it’s only under my neck where I only get razor bumps and I stopped using the multiple blade razors for razor bumps and switched to single blade and that’s helped so far but as soon as I let it grow out like a little bit bam ingrowns :(
2385 2018-05-29 20:20:52 what kind of oil do you use?
2386 2018-05-29 20:20:51 *pours vodka into humidifier* i love my essential oil diffuser
2387 2018-05-29 20:20:43 I may use other flour and swap the olive oil  for half avo and some apple sauce  thank you 
2388 2018-05-29 20:20:42 Are you serious? Where are all the savings from when your government was in power? The money from when oil was $100/barrel was completely wasted. The NDP are in the same position the CPC would be in regarding the pipeline. Quite being a hyprocrite. The CPC wouldn't do any better.
2389 2018-05-29 20:20:36 So let me get this right, ISrael threatens a Sovereign nation that's searching for oil in its own country. Meanwhile ISrael is stealing Palestine oil/gas in Gaza AND from Syria's soil in OCCUPIED Golan heights in breach of international law.  Wow they really have a nerve..
2390 2018-05-29 20:20:32 Yes! The oil cans from down unda!
2391 2018-05-29 20:20:27 Trump is the very definition of an empty suit selling snake oil.
2392 2018-05-29 20:20:13 im set in being skeptical of snake oil, yes
2393 2018-05-29 20:20:13 Does that mean dems will  begin refusing money from Exxon? Both sides have gotten lots of cash from oil but never worried about middle and low income Americans. Last time Washington took charge it was to fine coke company for price fixing. All gas stations do this daily. $$$$!!!
2394 2018-05-29 20:20:10 Where did the little pic come from ? Does it include the oil & gas taxes that comes out of Scottish waters ? Does it include all the exports which travel down south & leaves the UK via ferry & tunnel there for creating taxes for the area it leaves the UK.
2395 2018-05-29 20:20:10 Sunscreen all year! (And foundation because I’m a slave to the patriarchy). Just hate the crap around skincare more than anything : you ‘need’ to exfoliate/use a toner// use oil. You only NEED sunscreen & anything else is frivolity (which is ok just call it that, not necessity)
2396 2018-05-29 20:20:03 You did good!

Did you chose acrylic or oil paint?
2397 2018-05-29 20:19:58 You’re 100% correct Andy - the renewables sector is developing fast and this trend in oil prices can only help in keeping that momentum.
2398 2018-05-29 20:19:58 my coworkers are lovely, they laugh when i tell them oil popped in my eye

2423 2018-05-29 20:17:53 I've never used Korean skincare products, but my main advice in terms of skincare is to keep it simple. 1 gentle cleanser, 1 moisturizer, 1 toner or oil or something (optional) and 1 mask (optional) and that's it. Treat your skin kindly and it will thank you.

2427 2018-05-29 20:17:34 Do you know why Norway is sitting on trillions of dollars in their Heritage Fund? Because their natural resources were nationalized. They didn’t invite big oil from the US & China to hoover up the property of their countrymen. They sold their oil at their own pace & banked it.
2428 2018-05-29 20:17:34 Why then do you support oil tanker cars by the hundreds rolling down the banks of the iconic Fraser River endangering multiple runs of wild salmon ? What is YOUR plan to clean up that oil in the event of a derailment spilling into the river ??

2437 2018-05-29 20:16:34 With how old and decrepit my car now is, waiting for an oil change feels like waiting to receive “I’ve got some bad news” from a doctor
2438 2018-05-29 20:16:29 Currently getting an oil change and the workers are talking crap about my car so basically I’m paranoid I’ve done something wrong IM A GIRL IDK WHAT IM DOING OKAY
2439 2018-05-29 20:16:24 I know what you mean. Are you trying cannabis oil?
2440 2018-05-29 20:16:14 Thanks Bobby!! 
2441 2018-05-29 20:16:10 my car needs an oil change ... again.
2442 2018-05-29 20:16:09 Ain’t nothing sweet about corn. Worst food ever. Only edible if it’s cooked in oil and drenched in salt and butter.
2443 2018-05-29 20:16:07 I learned today, because my tires are so bad, that they don’t just automatically rotate your tires when you get your oil changed
2444 2018-05-29 20:16:04 5306F
2445 2018-05-29 20:16:04 Gotta love it when “dig up the old oil tank” turns into “oh hai old decommissioned septic tank” and everybody, including the town inspector, is meh about it.
2446 2018-05-29 20:15:53 Canada tries to boost controversial oil sands pipeline...
2447 2018-05-29 20:15:52 Its fair to disagree, but a democracy means decisions will be made for all sides.  Oil exports are a sizeable chunk of the economy, he has to consider those constituents as well.
2448 2018-05-29 20:15:51 7. handful of countries recognized Israel as the legal governing body of the area. That expanded gradually, but many countries have flip flopped on diplomatic recognition based on Arab countries’ threats to cut off oil supplies or b/c of Israel’s conflicts with its neighbors.
2449 2018-05-29 20:15:50 i was teaching rowand how to oil her door and she told me i should be a door engineer. she’s 20 and i still don’t believe what comes out of her mouth sometimes
2450 2018-05-29 20:15:47 We Will Worship - Like Oil
2451 2018-05-29 20:15:42 $EGY held well at $2 when the oil price is down.  The second Q should be better than the first Q!  Adding position at this level!
2452 2018-05-29 20:15:40 I'm thinking crush some garlic and onions in a pan with oil, top of with some Lime and diced tomato. really depends how lazy I get on my way home.
2453 2018-05-29 20:15:26 Paul
Nice article shared. The future of the oil & gas industry will always be in unpredictable position and will be the new norm. This will allow alternative renewable energy sectors to establish themselves. This can be only an advantage to us all.
2454 2018-05-29 20:15:17 Check your Engine oil today.
2455 2018-05-29 20:15:16 Yes! I use it as well, but I like rhassoul clay better. I buy my own veggies & fruits to make products with. I also make my own onion oil. It’s easy & cheaper than buying products.
2456 2018-05-29 20:15:14 I'm bringing oil and beverages! 
2457 2018-05-29 20:15:13 I'm cheating. It's paraffin oil left over from doing chopping boards. The Baolin polish wasn't making a difference
2458 2018-05-29 20:15:12 I think it’s super weird how there’s people on this earth that don’t own witch hazel, castor oil, tea tree oil, water, aloe Vera.....
2459 2018-05-29 20:15:11 Trump eliminated Obama-era oil regulations and all I got was a 100% oil price increase.

2462 2018-05-29 20:14:37 Dude...you gotta be optimistic.  Stop being so negative about pipelines and oil.  Let's work together instead of being against each other with assumptions & presumptions. Why allow foreign countries to make money off their oil and let them benefit?
2463 2018-05-29 20:14:34 The Elite Political Class; yes, the snake oil sales are still going strong.  The swamp does have a very thick slimy surface layer.
2464 2018-05-29 20:14:33 But there is no replacement yet. Not at the amount of volume anyways. I believe the technology that comes with Oil & Gas will get us there. We have to be smarter no questions about it.
2465 2018-05-29 20:14:29 SHAPE: Often use an essential oil.
2466 2018-05-29 20:14:28 If you’re looking for a sensible reason why people get nervous when yields spike or oil spikes etc....just GOOGLE “STRAIGHT LINE INSTINCT”
2467 2018-05-29 20:14:24 You honestly think that those words are going to change me, when my parents have been trying to bring me to god for quite some time now. Sell snake oil somewhere else.
2468 2018-05-29 20:14:21 Yes, Lawd!!   Cause, Momma,  she crazy..!!
2469 2018-05-29 20:14:08 Yep! We struck oil! HOPEFULLY  the west will finally stop listening to conservative rhetoric that rest of Canada doesn't care or love Alberta!
2470 2018-05-29 20:14:06 When we talk about crude oil,  a lot of people are quick to associate it with cars, forgetting that crude oil and it's resources are being used in so many sectors and for so many purposes. Look beyond cars and you'll see the potential of crude oil.

2473 2018-05-29 20:13:47 Annie... I so appreciate your story. Although I have chronic medical issues, so far, knock wood, they haven’t led to chronic pain. But I use CBD oil for arthritis. A life saver. Have been able to reduce other meds due to it.

Signed... Waiting for legalization in Canada 
2474 2018-05-29 20:13:44 Ooh what oil?
2475 2018-05-29 20:13:38 Runny scrambled with chives. Butter not oil.
2476 2018-05-29 20:13:35 2/ Then the new Syncrude project was bailed out by the PET government in the mid-70s when an oil company (Atlantic Richfield) left its promised 30% stake on the table. Then the Chrétien Liberals bailed out the oil sands in 1996 when prices were too low by offering tax-breaks. /3

2485 2018-05-29 20:12:40 Isn't that about Six months of Subsidy to the Oil Industry??? Just slash that

2487 2018-05-29 20:12:25 it says in my bio what I am, but since you are interested, I am the person who builds and maintains power plants, oil refineries, food processing plants, car plants.. ask me again how I feel about Clinton’s NAFTA and Obama’s TPP
2488 2018-05-29 20:12:15 Jeezus Murphy. Now we’re in trouble. Can’t even express how pissed I am. Taxpayers buying a private oil company pipeline that KM didn’t even ask us to buy!#JustinT you have no balls to handle legal & right way. #Horgan, #Trudeau, #McKenna & #Butts should all be in jail for this.

2490 2018-05-29 20:12:10 #Cavs #Cavaliers PF-C Tristan Thompson on superstar SF-PG-PF LeBron James: "Machines don't get tired. They just get an oil change."
2491 2018-05-29 20:12:09 Oh, but their Conservative "principles" make that impossible. How many times have Liberal governments come to the aid of the AB oil industry? This would be four times that I'm aware of. The original TM pipeline was a Liberal government creation in 1951. /2
2492 2018-05-29 20:12:08 Justin spent 4.5 billion to begin the phasing out of the oil industry. @JustinTrudeau @MarkGerretsen nobody trust the crooked liberals. Wait till next election u will both be out. It starts with a Ford victory next week. Liberals on life support conservative victory on its way
2493 2018-05-29 20:12:08 honestly I just eat the stuff with a little salad dressing, or cook it up with some garlic and oil.
2494 2018-05-29 20:12:01 Yeah this is like when companies shape up & advertise that they are the leaders in addressing the problem that they cause (oil companies & the environment, banks & predatory foreclosures, data collectors & data breaches, etc.) It's all a show to mitigate losses with marketing
2495 2018-05-29 20:11:57 Yes markets always fluctuate. Demand is on the rise, oil will go higher in my opinion

Oil Demand will grow while flucuating.....according to the experts until 2040.
2496 2018-05-29 20:11:56 Desert with  million tons of oil 
2497 2018-05-29 20:11:52 Tag .@RobertIger; he fired #RoseannBarr.
2498 2018-05-29 20:11:52 True. But the money generated by the oil sales would strengthen Canada's economy. And I believe a lot of us up here work in Alberta but maintain a home in BC.
2499 2018-05-29 20:11:47 Things like soy, gluten, canola oil and corn can irritate you and make you break out as well. I say remove those things individually for 2 weeks at a time to see if there is a difference in your skin over all.
2500 2018-05-29 20:11:44 Before Trump said anything about Saudis and other OPEC countries intentionally inflating the price of oil, Russia had already indicated it was going to increase output.
2501 2018-05-29 20:11:37 Petro-Canada wasn't "nationalized." It was created as a national company. We still need a national oil company.
2502 2018-05-29 20:11:34 I agree, and Oil & Gas will help us get there
2503 2018-05-29 20:11:22 Did that with Eucalyptus oil last week! ...Quess we could smell like worse things, eh??
2504 2018-05-29 20:11:12 Eye update: ocular surface disease. Some oil (?) is not mixing with my tears so the tears are evaporating too quickly and letting allergens and irritants get in there and fuck things up. My vision has gone from 20/15 to 20/40 since this started. It should go back to normal. Ugh
2505 2018-05-29 20:11:08 So they switched from the NRA to Big Oil. More crooks with their fingers in the pie.
2506 2018-05-29 20:10:58 @MassGovernor 
WHY so popular? MA Pike in worst shape ever! MBTA unreliable & antiquated. School spending discrepancies disgraceful.  Public Utilities head favors oil/gas over health & safety, climate & jobs.  RI has 4 wind turbines/MA=zero.
He wants death penalty!!!

2508 2018-05-29 20:10:46 Alberta and Sask have the strictest regulations in the world. We deserve the economic advantages for our hard work. The less we produce, the more countries like Saudi and other countries produce and sell to us. And guess what, that oil doesn’t just appear heat magically.
2509 2018-05-29 20:10:38 You know it is super hard to take you seriously when you’re retweeting Alex Jones right? That guy is a loon and a snake oil salesman. And according to his lawyer, “putting on a show”. He literally admitted this.

2513 2018-05-29 20:10:28 If he rammed the pipeline though, he loses BC and probably the next election. If he did nothing, he loses AB and all those involved in the oil industry.

I suspect he thought that buying the pipeline, then let it languish in limbo would solve his problem without costing votes.

2525 2018-05-29 20:09:38 So I cooked out yesterday, got hubby and I two nice bone in Ribeye steaks. Damn tooth ache, So I put mine in the fridge. Today I took out my grinder, cut the steak and grinded it with black olive oil juice, (I save it!) to a yummy grilled paste AND ATE'ED IT iT WaS So gOOd!!
2526 2018-05-29 20:09:32 Aloe Vera powder, neem powder, bhringraj powder, fenugreek, moringa powder, carrot oil/peels, onion oil, can coconut milk & oil, lemon oil/peels, orange oil/peels, curry powder or leaves, rhassoul clay, etc...are good too. I use all types of things for hair & skin products.
2527 2018-05-29 20:09:31 Venezuela did the same thing - kicked out all private oil and gas companies and nationalized them - now they do not have a prosperous oil and gas company.
2528 2018-05-29 20:09:23 Por cierto, no olviden usar protector solar, bebitos. Ahorita hay -25% en todo Eucerin, en las farmacias San Pablo. Su protector solar está increíble porque es oil control/matificante, y muy ligero. Perfecto para pieles grasas/con acné. Yo lo recomiendo 10/10.
2529 2018-05-29 20:09:18 Thanks for the fry-splanation. I had no idea French fries are made only of potatoes and salt and cooked in oil.  Not one clue.  If not for you I would have lived my life thinking French fries were made from bird bones and raccoon tongue squeezings.
2530 2018-05-29 20:09:16 In India men continue to burn their women with hot oil when they no longer want them.

2532 2018-05-29 20:08:55 It is noteworthy that we do what we are doing against the run of play. We defied the odds and the circumstances. We thrived in turbulent waters and steered our ship to safe harbours. We soared even when the oil prices dropped and were elevated. #udomemmanuelat3

2540 2018-05-29 20:07:56 Why do you blame the instrument? And the US is not indigenous to high mortality rates. What gives a criminal the motivation to do a crime more than a victim that cannot defend itself? If anything guns have protected citizens from crime. The Criminal not the tool is responsible.

2542 2018-05-29 20:07:52 Taxes? California's tax rates are static, standard deductions and exemptions are rising. Tax revenues are growing exclusively from rising personal incomes and GDP growth. Diversification is good.

I am sorry about Texas's recession, though. Maybe oil prices will lift it a bit.

2545 2018-05-29 20:07:38 This is what Saudi Russian preemptive talk of ending production cuts was aimed at avoiding. Bigger risk of Venezuela Iranian lost production leading to $100 spike than a return to oversupply leading to $50 oil.
2546 2018-05-29 20:07:37 There are other ways to control your oil. Baking isn’t the only one.

2551 2018-05-29 20:07:11 IMO it does help Horgan because the expansion now in federal control will never get built and as an added bonus the feds now own and control a large chunk of Alberta's assets moving oil to the coast. What could possibly go wrong?

Ester, just read about a 25 gallon spill north of Kamloops BC. The image which I’m told is 1,000 words, shows transfer pipes next to an oceangoing oil tanker. 

The subliminal messaging and social engineering look like an excessive exaggeration at best

2560 2018-05-29 20:06:47 It’s just a safe oil. I tried it when I got back from a holiday where I had 40-50 bites easily. Some swelled up to the size of half a golf ball and I’d taken antihistamine tablets and cream prescribed by a pharmacist on my return. I felt so feverish and I’ll I thought about
2561 2018-05-29 20:06:45 Oil and state should be separate I agree. Then tell the B.C Gov't to stop with the court case. B.C got involved, which forced the Federal Gov't to get involved. #TransMountain
2562 2018-05-29 20:06:27 History repeats itself again. Just like the 70s in the era of massive energy projects (Hydro in BC)...public ownership by governments to control production. My goodness, 4.5 billion?! Oil is a limited staple. I don't see this doing too well in the future. Just my 2 cents.
2563 2018-05-29 20:06:24 @kgun9 on your side needs to investgate the gas rigging of prices by the local suppliers
Oil fell $ 2.85 today and the prices are still high
Last before the holiday prices were rising and the local prices rose daily if not hourly 
I feel some kind of gouging is happening here
2564 2018-05-29 20:06:23 The pipeline does not get oil to tidewater. It sends bitumen to another country to refine and process so we can then BUY that oil. Should have built a refinery.

2567 2018-05-29 20:06:14 so if the Oil company does the pipeline they keep all the profits...
but now that they can't, Canada buys the company and distribute the loses through Canadians... 
Socialism for the rich.
2568 2018-05-29 20:06:10 When the pipeline is completed and the oil finally gets to tide water, we will elect Notley.

2570 2018-05-29 20:06:00 Sorry to hear that but I'm glad you have a great sense of humor! Possibly you should consider trying CBD oil if you keep having anxiety! Have a great day and hope you feel better ;)
2571 2018-05-29 20:05:57 Not many. She should know diff standards and tread very lightly. The protective cloak of "comedy" only works for particular ideology
2572 2018-05-29 20:05:57 And yet Harper still put all the eggs in the oil basket.
2573 2018-05-29 20:05:54 Alaskans own 89,381 shares of PARSLEY ENERGY INC, worth $2,905,776. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in UNITED STATES.
2574 2018-05-29 20:05:53 So now that all Canadians are going to be part owners of the #TransMountainPipeline, do we all get the employee discount on the oil and gas that goes thru it? Can you get back to us on that @JustinTrudeau ?
2575 2018-05-29 20:05:53 Crude oil is going down rapidly to $50.
2576 2018-05-29 20:05:38 I'm still on T or S. Haven't heard them. I have some oil and gas stocks in managed accounts. Also have GUSH spread but entry timing was bad. Biding time till opportunity for my favorite strategy resurfaces
2577 2018-05-29 20:05:10 Dem kill off Gadaffi fi we oil... Missionaries that we don't know what their mission is. Lyrics from @Kabakapyramid's #KONTRABAND ft. @Akon #MessageMusic #np on @ItaLrOOtsRaDio #lyricsdeity #Accurate
2578 2018-05-29 20:05:10 I'm sure Albertans are not stoked to have funded the rest of the country's economies with oil money since the NEP. Nice try. Albertans have paid their share thank you very much.
2579 2018-05-29 20:05:09 Jamaican Castor oil is good with hair growth
2580 2018-05-29 20:05:06 Putting $4.5 billion into an oil&gas pipeline is almost as wise as putting $4.5 billion into VHS tape futures. #cdnpoli
2581 2018-05-29 20:04:58 Is the stain water based or oil based. What are the instructions to clean the brushes?
2582 2018-05-29 20:04:48 @NissanUSA 2013 NV3500 Passenger van, still under powertrain warranty, brought in for noise, dealer says $11,000 engine replacement not covered because we don't have oil change receipts?
2583 2018-05-29 20:04:42 I had a friend right who worked for an oil company. She ended up having some ethical problems with that industry. She’s not rich, she’s just making it - but she quit that job because she didn’t feel right about it ethically and politically.  She made a choice.
2584 2018-05-29 20:04:30 vape oil. Please I must see
2585 2018-05-29 20:04:28 Yeah. You got it. It’s like a snake oil.
2586 2018-05-29 20:04:25 Just bought three oil changes for $14 total
2587 2018-05-29 20:04:17 y’all really put coconut oil on your face though??
2588 2018-05-29 20:04:09 Yes. We "know" that we can't keep using oil but it is virtually impossible to stop right now. Transition is necessary, urgent even, but the unfortunate and likely tragic cost of this will be that we will do so only after we've paid a severe cost and then a new normal will emerge.
2589 2018-05-29 20:04:04 Donald Trump is an f'ing oil tanker full to the brim with shame.
As a result, any additional shame just spills out into the ocean of his own self hatred.
2590 2018-05-29 20:03:59 Bcuz Trudeau has @jkenney by the cajones. UPC has no choice but to go along with Trudeau’s Marxist strategy or Notley will call Jason anti-Alberta oil. Oh the irony.
2591 2018-05-29 20:03:54 Are you brand loyal when it comes to oil, chain lube, cleaners, additives, etc.?
2592 2018-05-29 20:03:48 Oga, no light in Nigeria, dats 180 million people, never play yourself.
Mobil is still investing heavily in oil, why should Dangote not do so
2593 2018-05-29 20:03:47 Appallingly bad decision. I object to yet more of my tax dollars subsidizing the oil industry. I have voted Liberal for the last time.
2594 2018-05-29 20:03:47 Have you ever had CBD oil? I feel like it would benefit you from all the anxiety you're going through
2595 2018-05-29 20:03:45 Did you watch the programme about palm oil? Devastating
2596 2018-05-29 20:03:40 Agreed. I do think a lot of restaurants could do more to combat obesity though (e.g. amount of salt/oil) and this would go a long way to helping that - so many people have no clue how many cals/macros are in what they're eating
2597 2018-05-29 20:03:34 It is sad that she and her caucus have abandoned their environment policies and commitments in favour of satisfying the interests of the big oil companies. A betrayal of their environment supporters big time !
2598 2018-05-29 20:03:33 I really need some vegetable oil somebody should go to the store and get me some because I’m sleepy
2599 2018-05-29 20:03:19 Correct. It helps us journalists also to find information in Twitter about oil trading
2600 2018-05-29 20:03:15 Poko.... The same thing one kogi taxi man told me,.. He said it was woman that helped him with, then he started the oil business.... Sometimes like AA Oil
2601 2018-05-29 20:03:13 I seriously love it so much. I do use a setting powder at the end just to soak up any oil throughout the day but omg it’s so good!
2602 2018-05-29 20:02:59 Ed Schultz. Called Laura Ingraham a slut in 2011, wanted to rip out Dick Cheney's heart in 2012. MSNBC hired in 2013
2603 2018-05-29 20:02:59 If someone kills me and uses my remains as fertilizer than all those multivitamins and fish oil will make a nice strong tree :)
2604 2018-05-29 20:02:47 Correct, Oil of Clove works magic. My grandpa was a pharmacist and we always had I bottle in the medicine cabinet. That or brandy. LOL
2605 2018-05-29 20:02:46 Just taking a pittance back from all the dirty oil money we fed the rest of Canada on my whole life.
2606 2018-05-29 20:02:41 I don't want to ruin Canada financially, but I especially don't want to ruin this area of BC. Oil is a financial dead end. It's going to run out. There won't be any more. Setting up renewable energy sources is more financially astute than fighting over dregs.
2607 2018-05-29 20:02:38 My life is over. I forgot my book so I can't read while I wait for my oil change.
2608 2018-05-29 20:02:34 This morning I found out I got a first in my law assembly, I just need to oil a first out the bag with my dissertation and I’m all set 

If every single hand in of mine is a first for third year I will be a VERY HAPPY bunny 
2609 2018-05-29 20:02:29 This is going to sound really bad.... but I didnt wanna get the oil leak fixed so my dad bought me a new car 
2610 2018-05-29 20:02:24 Subsidy to kisi ne nahi diya petrol ka price central aur state ke tax kam karne ki jagah badhane aur jo naya niyam oil company ko diya hai. Jisse oil ki price daily nayi hoti hai. Ab un par sarkar bhi kuch nahi kar sakti
2611 2018-05-29 20:02:22 Your right, They are killing each other. Your just killing blacks. Its all good
And If you run out of oil, buy it.
2612 2018-05-29 20:02:16 Try using used coffee grounds, mixed with a little coconut oil.  Same  effect on skin,  cheap, and the caffeine has gone
2613 2018-05-29 20:02:07 Why not double sleeve oil pipes in sensitive areas,u need to learn from environmental spills. You should use absorbing products on spills. People demand so much of us, yet Japan’s still poisoning our ocean #JS 
2614 2018-05-29 20:01:49 The U.S. exit from the Iran nuclear deal creates the risk that Iran will leave a 50-year-old U.N. treaty to stop atomic weapons proliferation, said RBC Capital Market's Helima Croft.
An Iranian exit from the 1968 treaty would be like "rocket fuel" for oil prices and potentially
2615 2018-05-29 20:01:48 California puts it's on coastlines at risk and produces the world's dirtiest oil. Go protest that instead.
2616 2018-05-29 20:01:48 AHAHAH Giuls ma il tea tree oil non funziona più? A me tantissimo  ma me lo passo tutti i giorni sul viso con un dischetto di cotone prima imbevuto nell'acqua di Rose 
2617 2018-05-29 20:01:43 Libya is already under neocolonial rule. The elections hullabaloo is all but a make up. No matter who wins, their oil an economy is still under the control of the west. It's just a matter of time.
2618 2018-05-29 20:01:42 The right to work for less in less safe conditions. Afaik all those states are net welfare queen states sucking on the tit of union protected states (except for Texas, which benefitted from oil reserves much like Saudi Arabia).
2619 2018-05-29 20:01:42 Let's make more refineries. Construction jobs, lower costs and the ability to innovate for the future. This can be done more efficiently. Keep Alberta oil in Alberta.
2620 2018-05-29 20:01:41 Fortunately mine are used to me being very stingy with money, so if they are good they get an ice cream as extra, but the picnic will be healthy. Also daughter and I decided to avoid Palm Oil but we're struggling because so far it's in all treats! (Also good obvs!)
2621 2018-05-29 20:01:40 Accidentally bought tuna in oil instead of in water and I have 3 cans left of it fml
2622 2018-05-29 20:01:38 @keremoner TSLA ultra hyped over vertical integration of oil+auto (big vision) but will choke same way (on execution of hi mgmt projections)
2623 2018-05-29 20:01:37 Deer fly got me while I was cutting the grass with Q's walk behind mower when I couldn't let go. Eucalyptus oil helps.

2625 2018-05-29 20:01:31 I went for Corel Painter, cause the simulation of the different brushes is really good. Still so far I only worked with the pencil, charcoal and oil brushes. There is so much more to discover there.
2626 2018-05-29 20:01:30 Why is getting an oil change the most annoying thing?
2627 2018-05-29 20:01:23 Well wrong again, I'm half Hispanic,  I teach for a living, and I am all for finding a new energy so we're not dependent on coal and oil
2628 2018-05-29 20:01:09 Bill Morneau, u serious 1 pipeline is "holding back Canada's economic growth" all the Top Oil investors are pulling out of dirty oil and you still think we should be doubling down in Oil. Shortsited and naive just like PM JT. Out of touch with Canada and global shifts. Love it.

2631 2018-05-29 20:01:08 I suppose you are aware that the extant Trans Mountain Pipeline was a federal government project, right? It was created by a 1951 Act of Parliament to serve Leduc oil. The government-created company went through the then approval process and bingo! Trans Mountain was born.
2632 2018-05-29 20:01:04 My main concern is Lib gov will control who’s oil gets shipped and how much per barrel, environmental protection fees etc ect...

2635 2018-05-29 20:00:51 How sis got her legs out with no moisturizer it at least some baby oil. #AshyLarry got a daughter

2640 2018-05-29 20:00:15 Try Claritin, or CBD oil for anxiety.
2641 2018-05-29 20:00:09 Oh, that whole Christian lifestyle of his with having one wife, all kids being from him and her? Yes, you prefer a snake oil salesman, adulterous, bigoted ignorant loudmouth over a constitutionally educated man. No no. Definitely not racism.
2642 2018-05-29 20:00:05 It’s really good. The trick is freeze the ice cream solid. Like rock hard. Then you coat it in batter and fry in very hot oil.
2643 2018-05-29 20:00:04 Not compared to rightwit virtue signalling f'wits, shilling for snke oil pill sales ... what a state to get into to, hermit
2644 2018-05-29 20:00:03 The project should built by companies that are in that business that actually know what they are doing and not the tax payer paying for it. Should of been built privately,  increase the value of our oil by $30/barrel compare to usa price. More money for health care and education
2645 2018-05-29 20:00:01 Paying $70 for this oil change just broke my heart 
2646 2018-05-29 20:00:00 Still not used to their names but Noma bethini the new COO of Majulu oil is the same girl who did Oswanka..  #ImbewuTheSeed
2647 2018-05-29 19:59:59 dirty oil much more important than clean drinking water or healthcare? so so disappointed in this government
2648 2018-05-29 19:59:58 What if you and your ideology were THE PROBLEM? A little reflection on your part is in order.
2649 2018-05-29 19:59:53 Oil and gas are obsolete
2650 2018-05-29 19:59:39 leo na feel ku burn midnight oil ni ki try ku come up with fogged-catchy-detailed progress reports
2651 2018-05-29 19:59:38 Bit late to the party but just set alight to a pan of oil. Shit myself. Thanfully iv a fire blanket in kitchen at home.
2652 2018-05-29 19:59:23 pink lady apples , wee bit of red onion ... white balsamic , olive oil and some pine nuts .. had some cold meat and bread with it ... and sat outside !! 
felt like a holiday 
2653 2018-05-29 19:59:20 They can argue about the source of the oil, call 100litres inside a station fence ac’spill’ but modern pipelines are safe by any measure. By far the safest way to transport. Concentrate on safe tankers but don’t attack well regulated modern pipelines on safety.
2654 2018-05-29 19:59:07 mine has 249k and while it's a bit goaty and consumes some oil it still runs on the highway just fine!
2655 2018-05-29 19:59:05 Replace the ocean with  oil!
2656 2018-05-29 19:59:00 Lol they receive a discount, and the only reason they get this discount is because they sell oil. You really believe that a whole nation just made the decision on their own to go green?
2657 2018-05-29 19:58:45 I ordered pizzas and all my garlic dips are oil
2658 2018-05-29 19:58:41 Arguably, he’d like to steal votes from the NDP as he moves further socialist/Marxist by prescribing nationalization as a positive policy. Also JT will say @AndrewScheer is against oil exports bcuz he condemns the gov’t involvement while Trudeau blames evil “big” oil KM
2659 2018-05-29 19:58:39 can’t wait to just get home take a shower oil up and get in my bed...i’m over it
2660 2018-05-29 19:58:37 Data is the new oil, and blockchain is the pipes, and ICOs are the oil refineries, and drones are the petroleum byproducts, and the internet of things is premium unleaded gasoline, and Alexa is a half-used tub of petroleum jelly, and anyway it's all just oil is what I'm saying
2661 2018-05-29 19:58:35 Lavender oil is worth a try. Proper essential oil. It’s one of the few essential oils that you can apply direct and undiluted to the skin. I suffer terribly from all kinds of bites and I find it helps me bring down the inflammation and swelling and helps with the itching
2662 2018-05-29 19:58:33 Stick in food processor and then in jars with oil. Lasts ages 'lazy ginger'. Great for Indian cooking if you do half and half with garlic. Or chop and freeze rolled in cling film.
2663 2018-05-29 19:58:28 This is not what I expected from @JustinTrudeau @AlbertaTarSands produces the dirtiest and most expensive oil on the planet. How is it viable to ship it any where? We should protect the environment & plan on leaving most of what's left in the ground. @tarsandsRESIST
2664 2018-05-29 19:58:23 He’s on a special diet so he asked if we could cook it with less oil. Like, wtf does that mean???
2665 2018-05-29 19:58:22 This guy in comp: Zen needs to have sex, he needs to sprout out his oil or something
2666 2018-05-29 19:58:12 Iran have the right to self defence. Israel also has nukes that USA supplied Where's sanctions for them this is just biased hypocrisy. Look at Libya they had a nuclear program and they scrapped it. USA UK and France destroyed the country. Libya is now in chaos. French oil
2667 2018-05-29 19:58:08 Kinder Morgan has never spilled oil all these yrs John so what "catastrophic" effect are you referring to little buddy As for economy , so U like us buying OIL from the US instead then? Remember U R unelected @bcliberals @RachelNotley @JustinTrudeau @TransMtn @PremierScottMoe 
2668 2018-05-29 19:58:06 What do you typically do to cope with it? Have you tried CBD oil?
2669 2018-05-29 19:58:06 $EGN and oil / energy. Now that we got the amateur chasers and day traders out and options deteriorated..we can get on with things and do a little business.
2670 2018-05-29 19:57:52 Grinding oil savarkar did with Godse outside of kalapani also 
2671 2018-05-29 19:57:50 He's getting enough shit from the oil and car industry he doesn't need it from women on top of it. My Gawd!
2672 2018-05-29 19:57:33 we need to practise Namkanda's language

2673 2018-05-29 19:57:28 
2674 2018-05-29 19:57:22 @RachelNotley, (#Alberta's Premier), I understand why you want more revenue from the hyper-polluting #TarSands. As u say, you'll need it for hospitals to treat those who will suffer more fires, more air & water pollution, etc. You'll need more roads for those oil co. trucks, too.
2675 2018-05-29 19:57:19 Really your gonna make fun of the reason your not changing my oil really Tom don't be that guy shut up eat your lobster and thank God Rosanne ever gave u a chance!!!!
2676 2018-05-29 19:57:15 Hopefully it’s the guy who asked for fries without oil
2677 2018-05-29 19:57:14 The only oil that the CBC uses is oil from The Kingdom!! and as for gas, their own hot hair!!
2678 2018-05-29 19:57:06 Since when does an oil change take 3 hours
2679 2018-05-29 19:56:29 Maybe Ed Schultz has a free day?
2680 2018-05-29 19:56:28 Shipping bitumen out of Alberta just because American heavy oil refining capacity exists on the Gulf coast would not have appealed to Peter Lougheed and it should not be public policy in Alberta in my opinion 8/10
2681 2018-05-29 19:56:26 watch my slick drip.... like crude oil diamonds in the bezel @Drake
2682 2018-05-29 19:56:22 Certainly hope that they cover the story of PET accurately.. First of all, his involvement was NOT a bail out. It was bcause Trudeau wanted Canada to have more of an involvement in oil business  instead of importing. That is a huge diff.. Also Alberta was against the PET plan.
2683 2018-05-29 19:56:22 Me: I need to be fiscally responsible.

Me in Anthropologie: If I don’t buy this seaweed hair wrap and essential oil bath bomb I will literally fall off the face of the earth.
2684 2018-05-29 19:56:05 it's our equivalent to "Koch Brothers" / "Big Oil" / "Corporations, maaaan"
2685 2018-05-29 19:55:57 Get some Black seed oil(Amazon) & take it daily. I promise it will help a lot.
2686 2018-05-29 19:55:51 I usually ask for an oil change and quarters for laundry 
2687 2018-05-29 19:55:49 Barely . I use Aussie Conditioner and shampoo for wash day. I’ll mix the conditioner, warm water and and little olive oil and spritz It in my hair as a leave in.
2688 2018-05-29 19:55:42 Hair oil suggestions?

2690 2018-05-29 19:55:40 So glad my oil changes are free for the next four years 
2691 2018-05-29 19:55:17 of the company. Trans Mountain has the capacity to ship 100 million barrels of oil a year to B.C. That is worth a considerable sum. Oil trades for $50-$70 a barrel. 
What is entirely objectionable is the Trans Mountain Expansion project, the idea of shipping diluted bitumen 6/10
2692 2018-05-29 19:55:09 It wouldn't surprise me one bit.. a lot of cities in a few countries are legalising marijuana and a few shops in the UK now sell CBD oil, only like 2% but I think people are realising the health benefits
2693 2018-05-29 19:55:05 Are these ok in oil or are they designed for water based?
2694 2018-05-29 19:55:00 Liked the way oil stocks performed today and oil did not breach its low from yesterday.
2695 2018-05-29 19:54:57 I’ve just eaten king prawn and chilli pasta with spring onions, mint and chilli oil. It was amazing.

2700 2018-05-29 19:54:20 Pretty big crap shoot. It will be well over $10B before completed. With what's going on with Iran, they decide to flood the market, or any other producer, oil can fall quickly back to where it was just a few years ago.
2701 2018-05-29 19:54:14 I use rosehip oil and joboba oil along with Shea butter wake up feeling baby soft and lightens scarring
2702 2018-05-29 19:54:09 I need coconut oil back in my life
2703 2018-05-29 19:53:52 Yes, I'm sure anyone who shares a cell with Bubba Who Wants To Be Your Friend and 100 gallons of baby oil is a brave man.
2704 2018-05-29 19:53:46 What we used to do was mix peanut butter with salt, water, black vinegar, soy sauce and sesame oil, then mix that into plain cold noodles. Cheap food doesn't need to be bad.
2705 2018-05-29 19:53:42 Yes or strip it & oil it!! It would be a lovely colour 
2706 2018-05-29 19:53:31 whoa WTF happened to #euro-land reviving 1996 protections for EU co,s vs #trump sanctions for business in #iran? esp. #oil
besides #putin cooperating w #bananarepublic of @realDonaldTrump-istan is MUCHO weird #GreatGame==
2707 2018-05-29 19:53:31 Don, we need to coalesce and collectively fight our domestic & far away enemies, starting with; the Clinton Foundation, ISIS, AIPAC, ICE, FBI, Heritage Foundation, Pharma, Big Oil, the War/Death Industry, El Nusra and their affiliates, that should lead us to a better world.
2708 2018-05-29 19:53:22 Finally got my tire fixed now I need an oil change and my nails done and I’ll feel accomplished for today
2709 2018-05-29 19:53:16 And I'm not sure that's not already happening through the types of resources companies are going after (e.g. Shell's oil sands divestment, focus on shale plays with rapid decline rates...)
2710 2018-05-29 19:53:16 need some sash brushes i can use in oil, all the ones i have and keep looking at are for water based paints #decorating
2711 2018-05-29 19:53:02 If they are buying Venezuelan, or Iranian,  or Iraqi or Saudi or Kuwaiti or Mexican, the sulphur can be as high or higher than oil sands. Most of the their sales is to Asia.

So, again, nope. Try again. You are bound to get something right, eventually.
2712 2018-05-29 19:52:51 *youre
2713 2018-05-29 19:52:41 SAME but I'm heckin skeptical yknow? Especially with the oil industry being such a far right pressure. But you're right hopefully the gov involvement in the deal will help with that buuuut I'm not naïve enough to assume will have a large enough benefit.
2714 2018-05-29 19:52:39 Just bc you’re not gaining weight from all the food you eat, doesn’t mean you’re maintaining your health. People out here skinny af, yet their insides resemble motor oil :/
2715 2018-05-29 19:52:29 May Allah forgive him
2716 2018-05-29 19:52:16 @jjhorgan @AJWVictoriaBC @Wilkinson4BC STPU Horgan. In 53 years there has not been a spill. Is there risk? Absolutely, just there is every time you drive your car. You have created this constitutional crisis to appease a moralistic few who are all funded by US oil companies.
2717 2018-05-29 19:52:04 Tonight! We have our essential oil aromatherapy bracelet making fundraiser! (5-7pm) The cost is $20 per bracelet or 2 for $30. Proceeds will go towards supporting youth centre programs activities. Come out and make a bracelet!

All ages are welcome! Hope to see you there.
2718 2018-05-29 19:51:34 so Hasbro licensed Action Man to Japan and Japan made him a cyborg and then the oil crisis meant they had to make smaller robots which transformed and Hasbro liked the idea and bought the rights.

2720 2018-05-29 19:51:17 @Chevron dumped billions of gallons of oil in the Amazon. People are getting cancer and habitats are ruined. Maybe ABC can help take care of that quickly too? =\ xoxo
2721 2018-05-29 19:51:11 Where was the money coming from if we were independant dont say oil
2722 2018-05-29 19:51:07 On the subject of guacamole, I recommend s tablespoon of walnut oil. I accept the wisdom of macadamia nuts in pesto.
2723 2018-05-29 19:51:06 Coconut oil on everything tho
2724 2018-05-29 19:50:54 We finna go to war, we running outta oil, OR SOMETHING BECAUSE GAS RAISED 15 CENTS TO 2.89 OVER MF NIGHT . This shit is ridiculous asf and I need a reason .
2725 2018-05-29 19:50:53 In Ontario, 60% of electricity is nuclear, which is not usually considered green. And all public electricity generation indeed requires investment, not fairy dust, so when you're putting less and less in renewables you know they will remain marginal (conveniently for big oil).
2726 2018-05-29 19:50:49 Only if you were really behind on the oil change.
2727 2018-05-29 19:50:46 I have that plus a good dose of "the oil marks is gonna crash in the next 10 years," which is a fun complement to the pipeline nonsense.
2728 2018-05-29 19:50:45 Thank you :) I also mix coconut oil in with th clay mixture
2729 2018-05-29 19:50:44 mungkin sudah tiba masanya buat campaign ramdon oil lamp flour. diselit dgn illust juga boleh main watercolor. lukis2 petak gituuu

2733 2018-05-29 19:50:03 It’s a word I’ve never ever come across. As I was trying to watch something interesting on TV & I’m sitting between two blokes discussing (in this house that’s arguing about) sump sludge & oil changes, I let the word pass me by.
2734 2018-05-29 19:49:47 So we bought an oil pipeline. For cannabis oil?
2735 2018-05-29 19:49:40 So, you have a crystal ball that tells you the price of oil for the next 10 years?
2736 2018-05-29 19:49:11 your skin is a reflection of your gut bacteria so LIKE I ALWAYS SAY, u need a probiotic & an omega 3 supplement & start eating better oils like COCONUT OIL (which is also moisturizes pretty good if u use it on your skin)
2737 2018-05-29 19:49:04 so rock and roll

2741 2018-05-29 19:48:57 Ugh. That poor fork needs a tetanus shot...
2742 2018-05-29 19:48:57 How much for the oil? I think I need it..
2743 2018-05-29 19:48:54 It doesn’t justify them.  The gas and diesel spilled is 100 times worse than the crude oil flowing through those pipes. It’s not salt water.  Drive around Vancouver.  Look at all the oil leaks under vehicles.  Is that a catastrophe?
2744 2018-05-29 19:48:34 Escribirle o no escribirle esa es la cuestion
2745 2018-05-29 19:48:33 @elonmusk delete Twitter and get back to work, Mr Musk. Standing against the oil lobby is bound to invite some backlash which is what is being done with u now.  Hate to read so many negative articles about. You are an inventor. Stay focussed. #letsgotomars
2746 2018-05-29 19:48:31 So I sauteed some shrimp in olive oil and butter with some garlic, parsley and red pepper. Did I cook?  Does this mean I know how to cook now?
2747 2018-05-29 19:48:27 ..dont stress because of strechmarks its normal to have them...tell you, WE ALL HAVE THEM,, EVEN MEN! RELAX JUST USE YOUR TISSUE OIL JUST TO MINIMIZE THEM.
2748 2018-05-29 19:48:19 25% of oil revenue will go to Turkana County,Josphat Nanok is doing a great job.
2749 2018-05-29 19:48:18 I need those taxes to buy my Ferrari
2750 2018-05-29 19:47:54 No their not, the decision to bail out a Texas oil corp was the Liberal Feds.

2753 2018-05-29 19:47:34 Rosanne meant that Obama let down his voters on his mass surveillance, mass oil drilling, mass destruction of Middle East, Hondoras, and giving BILLIONS to Iran and not a dime to improve black communities' infrastructure. Created Worst refugee crisis too!
2754 2018-05-29 19:47:31 oil in my soya milk........ thats tru im .... noooooooo crispy youtiao dipped in soya milk its one of the best thing hhhhhhhhhhhhnnnnnnnggggggg
2755 2018-05-29 19:47:25 I want to cook it and wrap it around spiced goat cheese. With an olive oil drizzle.

Yeah. Im THAT person
2756 2018-05-29 19:47:25 Thing is though, most of them are fully aware that they are snake oil salesmen. They believe in nothing but trying to monetise fear and division for their own personal advantage. That's what makes them dangerous. Borderline sociopath behaviour.
2757 2018-05-29 19:47:20 Yes please. Right now the small business sector is leading and helping our communities reclaim the very values that will help cut waste whilst helping us all feel more connected and content. #zerowaste is not more expensive and neither are #localshops #indiehour

2759 2018-05-29 19:47:03 Seriously, I'm a virgin! Where do you think they get virgin olive oil?
2760 2018-05-29 19:47:01 Coconut oil on ya pussy 
2761 2018-05-29 19:47:01 I don’t know, but Cod Liver Oil sure makes the kids behave.
2762 2018-05-29 19:46:55 My friend suffers from terrible insomnia so I’ve suggested CBD oil, sent her a link and nearly fell off my chair when I saw how much it was for 10ml, but if it works then I suppose it’s worth it
2763 2018-05-29 19:46:33 I’ve had a busy morning starting at 6 this morning  taking hubby to work , rushing back to get the kids ready for school , getting breakfast , doing the oil change , doing laundry , cleaning the house UUGGHHH ! idk how I’m gonna do it when work starts but ima do it #SuperMom
2764 2018-05-29 19:46:28 Yep look for the brand st. Ives and I don’t personally use oil on my face cuz I have oily skin but a lot of people use coconut oil
2765 2018-05-29 19:46:25 
2766 2018-05-29 19:46:22 If only it was that simple. Crude oil is pervasive in our modern world. From the soles of your shoes, high tech gear you pack, furniture you sit on, carpets you walk on, roads you drive, even the pipes that carry water to farm fields, and your toothbrush. Seriously it's endless.
2767 2018-05-29 19:46:20 Going short Oil here is imprudent even for bears. Net length was far lower than the bottom in Feb. Don't think there is enough ammo for the downside. Not a panic situation. Buying CL and HO.
2768 2018-05-29 19:46:10 u like oil in ur soymilk I GET IT
2769 2018-05-29 19:46:07 I just love Regenerist by Oil of Olay, so light & not oily at all. I get the two pack at Costco when it is on sale

2771 2018-05-29 19:45:52 War on plastics: much of the rest of oil produced goes to petrochemicals. The EU’s recent announced ban on single-use plastics is the first shot across the bows of the petrochemical industry, in a war that will get nothing but fiercer. This is a longer-term consideration.
2772 2018-05-29 19:45:51 This $4.7 B paid by government of Canada for purchase of Kinder Morgan (oil pipe line company) could have been spent on Healthcare, Housing,  and Education instead!
2773 2018-05-29 19:45:45 I don't think Justin understands that building and maintaining an oil pipeline transferring bitumen unrefined bitumen is not a do-it-yourself project.

2780 2018-05-29 19:45:26 I think it's time for them to reevaluate the price of oil as stated in the budget. Think it was pegged at 35 or 40 USD. Currently, the price of oil is around US$70 per barrel. We don't need to be acting like we're in dire straits (++taxes) especially when people are losing jobs.

2782 2018-05-29 19:45:19 Yeah maybe I'm a hoarder but I just use the plastic straw to fix my 90 weight oil dispenser in my shop.
2783 2018-05-29 19:45:13 With amount of oil in the ground we should be rich. Canada should be a world money power house. Brazil became independent of foreign oil in the 70s why can't we do it. We don't have to grow sugar cane to do it.

2789 2018-05-29 19:44:35 Well, the new battery #TESLA is testing hit over 600 miles on a 3 dollar charge. So, i believe the point is moot. Cleaner air, and clean oceans with no oil spills is in our future.

2792 2018-05-29 19:44:11 Canada & US need to do the same. Abromovich’s Canadian based steel company has at least two contracts in US for major oil pipelines for the Dakota Pipeline & the new one running from OK through TX to Gulf
2793 2018-05-29 19:44:08 Q is convincing ppl to trust blindly. Research Genie Oil and who sits on the board, then research Trump’s connection to the Rothchilds.
2794 2018-05-29 19:44:03 Jarrett and Obama hate America, and the Constitution, thus tried to "fundamentally transform". They abhor Christianity. Obama's legacy is that of a snake oil salesman, and perpetuated a racial divide.

2797 2018-05-29 19:43:42 Russia wants to do big oil and other projects which it can’t do with the sanctions in place. Clinton would not have lifted or relaxed them. Also, the GOP platform on Russia/Ukraine was changed at Trump campaign’s request.

2819 2018-05-29 19:41:17 "Oil, Nigeria's primary commodity, was priced under Abacha at an average of 17.39 per barrel, yet the country became a perpetual importer of petroleum product, as all her refineries packed up."

2821 2018-05-29 19:40:53 Stubbs: More than $100b in energy investment has left. Oil and gas is thriving around the world - especially in the US. 100k+ jobs. You're sacrificing Canada's best interests!

2833 2018-05-29 19:39:36 McKibben is a serial liar. His information on the oil sands is inaccurate and out of date. He says that our government, phasing out coal,  cutting fugitive methane emissions,  and pricing carbon,  is just like Trump. Insane!

2837 2018-05-29 19:39:02 Wow! The USA has been exporting our oil since they legalized exporting Crude from the country! Big business - buy it at 40% discount to WTI delivered to Marine terminals on the Gulf Coast - sell for Brent World price and 2X your money. I wonder if @Tzeporah is allowed in the USA.

2843 2018-05-29 19:38:05 While we tweet about Barr & ABC, the world is under attack by neo-cons and big oil, destroying habitats and wildlife. If only our government moved as swiftly as networks did to help people and wildlife who need it most. >=( xoxo #HBDC #War #Priorities

2846 2018-05-29 19:37:32 Hey @elonmusk the Federal Government of @Canada just bought an oil pipeline for $4.5 Billion!!!  How many Megawatts of clean, solar energy, with battery backup, could they have built for the same price?  Maybe you could educate them.

2852 2018-05-29 19:36:52 I would not get to excited, people at this point are totally disillusioned by all the political nonsense. I think it would be wise to zip it .com until Alberta physically see’s oil flowing to global markets.

Alberta is a province
Alberta has contributed $300B to Ottawa in "equalization"
Norway has a tax rate that is insufferable (I've been there)
Norway has pipelines to get it's oil to market at market prices
We'd be happy to have our $300B back and leave

Suncor inherited Petro-Canada's 20% stake in Hibernia. Calgarians derided Petrocan HQ as "Red Square" in the 1980s due to Ottawa's unwelcome presence.
2866 2018-05-29 19:35:40 If KM is not build America will continue to pay us whatever they want if it is built then we have option to sell Canadian oil to other buyers. Is American interest trying to stop it? Is Kenny working for American interest?

That being said, It seems odd that a country that has our amount of oil has to import oil in tankers from the outside. I have no idea what env impact it has.
2881 2018-05-29 19:34:35 Oh, and I think environmentalist concern over #pipeline #oil spills are disingenuous. They just want to keep Canadian oil buried, regardless of the needless economic costs. Countries will simply buy their oil elsewhere, and Canada loses. #cdnpoli

2905 2018-05-29 19:32:30 Still sceptical how many oil companies will follow the strategies instead of resisting and then failing. Especially concerning deciding on divestment I fear possible paths may be confused with paths that will be taken. Or do you think most companies will pick these?

2959 2018-05-29 19:28:31 the Scots are the new blamehound for failing Britain post brexit , which is ironic cos its bailed it out since 79 when oil first landed.
2960 2018-05-29 19:28:29 Frankincense, also referred to as olibanum, a type of essential oil used in aromatherapy that can offers many health benefits. It can help relieve chronic stress and anxiety, reducing pain and inflammation, and boosting immunity. And what about frankincense oil for cancer. Yes!
2961 2018-05-29 19:28:28 Came in for a quick oil change/ tire rotation and I’m still here 2 hours later and I’m going to be leaving with a new tire (-: sos wasn’t planning on this
2962 2018-05-29 19:28:08 The reason behind the sharp spike in diesel, petrol prices
A supply cut by Opec and Russia led to a rally in crude oil prices. The Indian basket of crude cost $63.80 (average price) in March 2018 from $47.56 a barrel in 2016-17
2963 2018-05-29 19:27:54 @Gidi_Traffic
Countries that have increased fuel prices since crude oil went from $45 to $70
Brazil
Saudi Arabia
UAE
Mexico
Angola
Dear Nigerians, get ready for a price increment soon,maybe after next years elections. Unless the prices goes down again.
2964 2018-05-29 19:27:51 Hoy todas las bolsas en rojo, commodities en baja (salvo oro y oil), ADR argentinos en picada, muchos entre -4 y -7%.
2965 2018-05-29 19:27:51 The two I mentioned are coconut oil based, that tends to mostly be the case in my experience
2966 2018-05-29 19:27:44 Sorry. Had to take time off for a medical procedure. They wouldn’t let me tweet while they were cutting on me.
2967 2018-05-29 19:27:37 $67 USD a barrel for oil:  $1.56 a litre at pump what are you  @acccgovau
2968 2018-05-29 19:27:30 Is $60 for a oil change good or they playing tf outta me?
2969 2018-05-29 19:27:27 Lots and lots of extra virgin olive oil
2970 2018-05-29 19:27:18 Bamboozlers and purveyors of snake oil. Frauds.
2971 2018-05-29 19:27:14 I've bought tyre and engine oil
The car is coming together piece by piece
2972 2018-05-29 19:27:13 Apparently I have a business card holder. It had oil blotting sheets in it  #modelbehavior #notanymore
2973 2018-05-29 19:26:56 If we don’t get this done, why would Alberta agree to a cap on oil sands and a carbon price? The @RachelNotley gov is the only hope to agree to this.
2974 2018-05-29 19:26:52 No pipelines have been built under Trudeau. That’ll happen when Butts/Soros have control of Alberta Oil. Buying the TM Pipeline is the beginning of the end for Alberta IF we don’t stand united somehow. We’ve been played by dirty politicos.

2977 2018-05-29 19:26:33 I'm actually in my office surrounded by monitors and No one else around!!! I hate working alone!! 
2978 2018-05-29 19:26:33 ... and the failure(s) of the oil industry isn't the fault of any one government either. Kenney needs to pick a lane.
2979 2018-05-29 19:26:13 They are so stupid!!! They want a riot try taking our extra money away. I'm glad to have it. It covers my real estate taxes!! That's important to me. Hey start selling our oil and bring prices down! #MAGA #SAVETHECHILDREN
2980 2018-05-29 19:26:11 I haven’t got a good history with orange. Drunk it mixed with castor oil to induce a severely overdue baby. To this day I can’t face Mr Juicy Orange 
2981 2018-05-29 19:26:02 AND OIL
2982 2018-05-29 19:25:56 We’re not as dependant on fossil fuels as the oil industry wants you to believe. Yes, combustion engines need it, but much of the liquid fuel we use can be replaced with electricity or other thermal energy types. Investments in energy storage can make an impact as well.
2983 2018-05-29 19:25:50 SURE. They joined the British govt and SOLD Black HERITAGE of Hebrew Biafra in West Africa to jihadists for oil and SLAVERY. Ever wonder why no major news carries the continued GENOCIDE of Biafra Jews and Christians in Nigeria.
2984 2018-05-29 19:25:41 Big Oil Hamm doesn’t think Cramer is anything more than a pawn, but he has to throw money at campaign to get him elected. Does Rob have a similar motivation? He’s just too tight with Cramer to have us believe they share similar beliefs, eh, @FORUMCOMCO ?
2985 2018-05-29 19:25:40 aaaah those are hecka cute!
I've been trying my hand at oil painting some jungles myself! I can send you some pics tomorrow at school if you want!
2986 2018-05-29 19:25:35 So what the feds have come up with is to BORROWED money to buy out the project so KM gets to make it's money building it, we get the bill, and at the end of the day the primary route for AB oil to get anywhere except to Trump is fully owned and regulated by Ottawa
2987 2018-05-29 19:25:16 Yeah I just feel like in ab especially there's way too much focus on the aspect of "get rich quick" kinda plans which blinds everyone to the long term issues. I have to check sources once more but when I was researching it seems like fewer and fewer countries are investing in oil
2988 2018-05-29 19:24:51 I prefer foreign oil and tankers too
2989 2018-05-29 19:24:39 Stick some courgette, onion and peppers in there w olive oil and seasoning roast at 180 for 40 mins and issa MEAL  I need to do one again real soon
2990 2018-05-29 19:24:37 We don't need the increased capacity of #KinderMorgan. It assumes we should triple production in tar sands. Works against climate goals. We want planned, gradual reduction in oil production over 20-30 years. A concrete plan to change our economy to renewable energy & wean off oil

2995 2018-05-29 19:24:04 Girl i swear to m&ms people be suggesting freaking jojoba oil for acne scars
2996 2018-05-29 19:24:03 Is govt planning to sell it later at a profit? Oil is so cyclic I can see that making sense.
2997 2018-05-29 19:24:00 Can you ask him why this step wasn't taken for Energy East.  Our biggest population centers are running on foreign oil supplies, ridiculous.
2998 2018-05-29 19:23:58 Same old shit in this country let’s not get behind the lads let’s dish up some shit take their minds off the prize in hand. WELL DONE UK MEDIA the big question is why wasn’t John Terry considered to go instead of that oil painting Phil Jones 
2999 2018-05-29 19:23:51 Versus May 21:

Clearly, the national average will be in catch up mode in coming days. #gasprices #oil #OOTT
3000 2018-05-29 19:23:35 Obviously, Turdeau created the uncertainty to create the need for the government to nationalize the project thereby taking complete control of Canada’s ability to export oil to world markets.
3001 2018-05-29 19:23:27 Sorry to hear that, do you perhaps tried cbd oil for it?
3002 2018-05-29 19:23:26 When I was a kid..SNAKE oil was all the rage

It cured everything

Then Fish oil was the ticket

Then Krill oil was the hottie

Now Hemp oil...??

ALL OIL IS BAD FOR YOU !!

corn, olive, canola, motor..DO NOT EAT OIL

It causes inflammation..ALL disease is caused by inflammation
3003 2018-05-29 19:23:15 US-based WTI crude oil has bounced from its session low at $65.80, holding up the previous session's low and not tempting the 100-day moving average (at $65.17)
3004 2018-05-29 19:23:15 Got to sit at the bedside of man dying of cancer today. Read Matthew 5, John 11, Romans 8. Anointed him with oil. Prayed the Spirit's presence. Told him that nothing can separate him. Cried a bit with him.

Reminded me how indescribably holy this work is.

3007 2018-05-29 19:23:09 Aside from the environmental risks, you are supporting a pipeline that will take Canada's oil to other countries by ship. The pipeline just carries it to a port. I oppose that. I'd offer you a dictionary to look up "hypocrisy", but I think you'd be better served with a thesaurus.
3008 2018-05-29 19:23:06 Gonna be honest: personally I don’t like you or what you define as “journalism”. However, I agree that YouTube banning you or anybody else for promoting CBD oil is ridiculous. Obviously YouTube needs to read one of the millions of scientific articles on CBD oil & what it treats.

3011 2018-05-29 19:22:57 PM Shahid Khaqan never passed on the advantage of int'l oil price when they were low like Nawaz Sharif used to. Oil prices have only increased during his tenure. Why is he then passing on the disadvantage?

3017 2018-05-29 19:22:27 -the oil is moving anyway, may as well be by the safest proven way.
3018 2018-05-29 19:22:27 Fair point - I was writing to disparage beauty product snake oil, not workers
3019 2018-05-29 19:22:24 Tough call for the Saudis, as they need a good oil stock environment for the Aramco IPO

3021 2018-05-29 19:22:22 That is a lot of cabbage. Thoran (simple version: quick saute w/ mustard seed, green chiles, curry leaves  in  hot oil first) + coleslaw, okonomiyaki is what gets us through. All can be made with aliquots of shredded cabbage.

3024 2018-05-29 19:22:05 Gbam!!! Low oil price, empty forex reserve ,politicians scrambling to buy all the $ to hide in tanks and houses and a society that is cursed with taste for foreign goods. There's no way the Naira won't die .....we all saw it.

3026 2018-05-29 19:21:53 Air, ground, water and noise pollution will also give your Cities Skylines cities merry hell to your cims as well. 

Your city can also suffer in not enough residents for jobs, too many people and no jobs, and industry faces depletion of ore and oil resources
3027 2018-05-29 19:21:47 -The pipeline will bring in far more money that can be used to finance the shift to alternative energy. 
-the dirtiest oil comes from California from the same companies that fund unrest here, in order to hurt the competition and keep the heat off themselves.
3028 2018-05-29 19:21:41 @channelstv The so-called growth we see now is because of rise in oil price.  Not any ERGP or reforms.
3029 2018-05-29 19:21:38 Doing the same thing. And its tedious work If you ask me
Konje I thought caster oil is only used to make your stomach go grrrrr...learn new things everyday hay.
3030 2018-05-29 19:21:28 Oh, they definitely are not. They are the other half of the equation with the snake oil peddler.
3031 2018-05-29 19:21:26 I’m going to have to use grape seed oil more often.
3032 2018-05-29 19:21:21 大丈夫？
3033 2018-05-29 19:21:12 You’re right - my (poorly worded) comment was aimed at the snake oil marketed as beauty product, not the people working in sales.
3034 2018-05-29 19:21:09 'Roseanne' cast and crew are being asked to report to their nearest Starbucks location this afternoon for racial sensitivity training.
3035 2018-05-29 19:21:09 When will they ban oil stones and files so they cant be resharpened?

This really needs to stop! It solves nothing, prevents no crimes just hinders law abiding people.

That actually seems to be the end goal because they must realise by now!
3036 2018-05-29 19:20:47 I just chatted with Municipal Enforcement about this. If the car is pouring oil and it's entering the drainage system, please call 911 and ask for hazmat. If you call Municipal Enforcement at 403.948.8892 they can give you info. on situations that they will come look at.
3037 2018-05-29 19:20:40 Remember TD Bank Deputy Chair Frank McKenna spoke on air of bank study showing Canada lost $117 billion in 7 yrs selling our discounted oil to U.S. Also concerned investors may have worries this nation.

3039 2018-05-29 19:20:35 Even if you agree with the dubious premise of the need to export oil products, WTF aren't they refining bitumen in Alta then shipping less potentially watercourse destructive refined products west?
3040 2018-05-29 19:20:31 Alberta already knows with or without #KinderMorgan their supply will exceed demand. Its why they brought in legislation that lets them pick winners and losers in the oil patch via export quotas - the fight with BC is a smokescreen to hide it #bcpoli #canpoli
3041 2018-05-29 19:20:27 i’ve had it in a variety of ways (tonight was roasted in sesame oil with some sweet potato) so hopefully i’ll get the max benefit from it.
3042 2018-05-29 19:20:18 It’s so hot my car want a oil change
3043 2018-05-29 19:20:15 I never said Scotland couldn't be independent, of course it could. That was never the argument. Its the "we will be the best small country in the world and we will all be 4100 pounds better off .. Our Oil ..blah blah All the shite in the white paper basically.

3048 2018-05-29 19:19:50 @shell thanks a lot for this fantastic may summer. I hope you keep on slurping the last bits of oil from our earth, so we can enjoy some more extreme weather and let's break some more records together! #fuckrenewables #fuckinvestinthefuture
3049 2018-05-29 19:19:45 Maybe, but I'm not taking the blame. Fishermen, oil rigs and sewers that pump into the sea are the problem.
3050 2018-05-29 19:19:40 You already have it transported by pipeline and rail. 
Further, the vast majority of oil produced in the oil sands now is by horizontal drilling and SAGD just like everywhere else in North America.
You're regurgitating NDP/Green baloney

3059 2018-05-29 19:18:47 My plug is a grower, I love sipping oil..
3060 2018-05-29 19:18:45 For sure! I'm not super well versed in any of this; most of my knowledge comes from reading news articles and googling fact sheets, but my thoughts are that alberta has been p much solely reliant on the oil industry for it's revenue, and look what happened as soon as there was-
3061 2018-05-29 19:18:43 Change my oil bitch

3068 2018-05-29 19:18:14 By buying the pipeline from #KinderMorgan, the Cdn govt has become an oil company. Our MPs are like local #TransMountain reps. And we are shareholders. So let's call them.
3069 2018-05-29 19:18:13 "Not every republican is a big evil oil tycoon racist." [Citation needed] 
I'm kidding. But at the same time, it is important to remember that Republicans who voted for/like/support the policies of 45 are undeniably racist—by action certainly, if not by intent.

3072 2018-05-29 19:18:08 he was, guardiola was raving about him. however he gave a press conference and said that United are a real, traditional club so he wanted to join us rather than "oil money"
3073 2018-05-29 19:18:04 And then buy an oil pipeline. @Bill_Morneau is living the dream!
3074 2018-05-29 19:17:58 Ontario hydro a lot like shale in 2014, all spend, no concern for profit, of FCF. No voter wanted to pay the real price of electricity, just like no driver wanted to pay the real cost of shale oil.

3078 2018-05-29 19:17:41 I hope also that Kinder Morgan will be denied access to any oil in Canada whatsoever for at least five years. That is the standard clause any sale of any business.

3082 2018-05-29 19:17:16 This place is really trying to charge 90 dollars for a synthetic oil change. No way, no how. Get the fuck outa here with that bullshit. Who says lube shops are cheaper than dealerships? I never pay more than 40 for my minor services..... 
3083 2018-05-29 19:17:08 Well it should be called rapeseed oil (yes I know it’s a terrible name) but since everyone wasn’t a fan of the name they changed it
3084 2018-05-29 19:17:05 Have you tried it crisped in the oven with a little olive oil and sea salt???? It’s amazing!!!!

3088 2018-05-29 19:16:45 @JustinTrudeau the idiocy of committing $4.5 billion to build a pipeline to extend oldtechnology is almost unfathomable. If you truly care about #Canada, why not invest $4.5 billion in switching Canada to new tech such as #solar, #fuelcells, #wind, #hydrogen etc? Oil #POLLUTES.
3089 2018-05-29 19:16:43 I get it we all have different opinions on things in life. I just don’t understand when people want to force their opinions on others. Not to mention using slander and racism, it’s like watching oil and water separate. I’m still a proud American & Bears fan.
3090 2018-05-29 19:16:43 I suspect @JustinTrudeau has reasons for his unpopular and apparently stupid bail out of US oil firm at taxpayers expense. BUT, unless he can explain those REAL reasons, it will come back to haunt him.

3092 2018-05-29 19:16:38 Hi Mary, Thank you Ma'am.. 
3093 2018-05-29 19:16:38 Yeah ight lol. All her clothes boutta take a jump into a tub of baby oil & bleach 
3094 2018-05-29 19:16:37 Hear what?
3095 2018-05-29 19:16:37 Where is Trudeau getting 4.5 billion to buy an oil pipeline when Indigenous rights and sovereignty are being ignored, essential services are being cut or eliminated, and many people live in abject poverty?

3096 2018-05-29 19:16:31 Shea moisture's leav-in conditioner from their their jamaican black castor oil line does nothing for 4c
3097 2018-05-29 19:16:27 It is not an act of love its an act of suicide putting the lives of ordinary folk on the breadline entirely detrimental to their well being Oil is 95% of our lives there is no replacement and to imagine that there is exposes a deep ignorance of reality not enlightened intellect
3098 2018-05-29 19:16:20 I'm in NG, oil's skinney better looking cousin. I think when the PM asked for a "Downstream Emissions" study be applied to Energy East it made it open season to change the rules on the CDN oil industry. Its weird the downstream emmisions study is only applied to one industry?
3099 2018-05-29 19:16:01 just put oil on ur face
3100 2018-05-29 19:15:58 1) Did your dog had epilepsy? 2) It’s not me who has to show that it works 3) This looks like the typical snake oil merchant scheme with you appearing unprompted to say that this thing is the best
3101 2018-05-29 19:15:44 Burning the aznidayana's oil.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAH

Burning the midnight oil
3102 2018-05-29 19:15:34 It already is a thing look up how big oil conquered the world
3103 2018-05-29 19:15:29 Until you stop using palm oil as an organisation and destroying natural habitats I won’t be drinking Pepsi.
3104 2018-05-29 19:15:28 Better olive oil?
3105 2018-05-29 19:15:23 I know the feeling
3106 2018-05-29 19:15:20 Thanks RD.. 
3107 2018-05-29 19:15:04 Buddy they aren't taking over a private sector...LOL this is one companies northerner(canada) projects. Its totally different, and you should be happy, they are doing this for Alberta, for oil worker jobs, for the economy. This guarantees the project happens ya goof......smh lol
3108 2018-05-29 19:15:00 They have started to share groundnut oil and Aso Ebi in my neighborhood
3109 2018-05-29 19:14:59 Right! But have you tried the Argan oil products, I love them
3110 2018-05-29 19:14:49 I think she’s hysterical! We all say stupid stuff. But you are spot on with all this hypocrisy!
3111 2018-05-29 19:14:49 How about the fact there is no market and oh! that IMO new rule that tankers must reduce their transport of dirty oil by 50% by 2020? What about the last 76 Southern Resident killer whales? What about reconciliation which now means zilch?
3112 2018-05-29 19:14:49 We don't have time to invest in oil and gas. Look at the science, PLEASE.
3113 2018-05-29 19:14:41 I've been eating a lot of asparagus lately. I like it with olive oil and turmeric on it.  The stores are stocked now with good locally grown tomatoes and sautee them with bell peppers and garlic just like in old Napoli. Lol Perfect in lieu of processed pasta sauce.
3114 2018-05-29 19:14:40 If BC didn't block a federally approved pipeline a Texas oil company was going to build us a 4.5$ billion pipeline. LET FREE MARKETS REIGN!!
3115 2018-05-29 19:14:39 $86 for a oil change and $40 to fill up on gas...y’all know I’m going get a bicycle

3118 2018-05-29 19:14:31 "Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde praised the deal: “Who said oil and water don’t mix?”
3119 2018-05-29 19:14:23 They weren't going to leave. The oil is where the oil is.
3120 2018-05-29 19:14:22 Use tea tree oil every morning and every evening before you go to bed!! It really works and made my skin look glorious within a really short amount of time!! you can buy it in nearly every drugstore and it's not even that expensive. 
3121 2018-05-29 19:14:20 Doctor: so just smell the lemon oil and u should be- 
Me: *already peeling the lemon and eating it* you can’t stop me from eating lemons doc
3122 2018-05-29 19:13:58 Pipelines are everywhere. millions of miles of it transporting oil, gas, and natural gas to domestic markets.
3123 2018-05-29 19:13:53 What has coconut oil done for anybody’s hair? That shit weak
3124 2018-05-29 19:13:47 Indonesia menempati peringkat 1 dalam produk pertanian,

Other projects include the 21-Storey Office Complex which will house the Oil Companies and change the skyline of Uyo metropolis;the ongoing construction of the 2nd Airport Runway and the upgrade of the Airport Main Runway to Category 2 #DemocracyDay
3127 2018-05-29 19:13:39 While Burnaby is liable for allowing houses and schools near oil storage tanks, it's still irresponsible for Kinder Morgan and now federal government for paying for @TransMTN that will send shivers down to many North Burnaby residents
3128 2018-05-29 19:13:23 They control USA government, military, oil, national bank, also. That's why so much support of Israel from USA. A breakthrough was 9/11. A very controlled operation. Their are so many think tanks around the world to spread the propaganda. They think they are the chosen people.
3129 2018-05-29 19:13:18 The future of the automobile industry is hybrid which will still require fuel but it a minute quantity . Moreover, the oil industry is not only relevant to the automobile industry. Gas is used in power generation and there's also the petrochemical industry that use oil byproducts
3130 2018-05-29 19:13:16 Yup.  True story.

Canada panics at the mere thought of selling less oil.  As a country, we're in complete denial.

3135 2018-05-29 19:12:58 Very cool! Ink in the 1830s was typically a mixture of linseed oil, rosin, and lampblack (carbon soot). At the end of the day, printers placed the type in a lye trough and scrubbed it with caustic lye (made with potash and water) to remove all remnants of ink.
3136 2018-05-29 19:12:55 The policy is a fraud for a whole host of reasons, singling out the oil sands is a bit unfair. Yes the oil sands is amongst the largest emitters but the emissions are being capped. The wider problem is that energy transitions are hard and take time.
3137 2018-05-29 19:12:46 But, he is not traditional neither a sheep to follow what others did..
That is why today Trump is President because we didn’t want any more empty suit with a silver tongue selling snake oil.
3138 2018-05-29 19:12:45 Seriously disillusioned by the power of oil to co-opt so-called "progressive" politicians. A true petro-state.
3139 2018-05-29 19:12:44 i literally cover every inch of my body in coconut oil, it’s my holy grail
3140 2018-05-29 19:12:39 SUBSCRIBERS: We will be reducing Crude Oil Short positions now and awaiting a bounce. Great trade! All other positions remain the same.
3141 2018-05-29 19:12:35 I know most of what I know about coconut oil because of you. It’s your first video I ever watched bc I was researching coconut oil lolllll
3142 2018-05-29 19:12:34 A car oil kink
3143 2018-05-29 19:12:34 BC or Saskatchewan would be fine. If Canada needs to prop up the oil industry so badly (gov't buying Kinder Morgan pipeline), it makes sense to do more domestic processing?
3144 2018-05-29 19:12:29 I dont do this, but at least find off brand oreos or other products with certified sustainable palm oil. I havent found an oreo brand with sustainable #palmoil yet, but maybe you will. There are companies who do a better job. Stay away from @nabisco oreos.
3145 2018-05-29 19:12:22 I’m not sure why Lib MPs don’t talk about safe, clean waterways as being in the national interest as well. Oil jobs/export are a short sighted 2.2% GDP national interest consideration. Environmental & renewables are a 100% necessity.
3146 2018-05-29 19:12:21 Tea tree oil it doesn’t work for everyone tho
3147 2018-05-29 19:12:17 Did you ever find any clove oil? Some of the "toothache kits" sold in drug stores have it as part of the kit.

3149 2018-05-29 19:12:03 The coherent oil merchant cries out, "... and just before he passed away, he screamed "The Texts of The Desiccated Web"! 
#DnD #RPG
3150 2018-05-29 19:11:51 Ok??? Not sure what that means?
3151 2018-05-29 19:11:36 In the 1980s Thatcher spent billions from North Sea oil on unemployment benefits rather than investing it in industry and our country. Madness.
3152 2018-05-29 19:11:28 It's not only what people say. Look at what's happening too. Flint, Puerto Rico, oil contamination yet more pipeines, almost daily shootings, more war etc.

3154 2018-05-29 19:11:04 Thanks Laurie... I was tweeting and Dm'ing with no responses..  
3155 2018-05-29 19:11:02 Still, the ramp-up after it comes on is phenomenal. Our poor, old oil heater hardly makes a dent.
3156 2018-05-29 19:10:54 Nothing worse then the Republican oil spill...

What kind of stupid statement is that anyways.
3157 2018-05-29 19:10:49 This is subject to a federal investigation right now. It will be hard to pinpoint the exact cause. Right now we are subject to speculation and a comments section gone wayward. You should probably cook your oysters regardless. Marine life that tries to eat crude oil will die.
3158 2018-05-29 19:10:45 I love questions like that, it gets me to research.

As far as I can tell initially, in 1992 the Falklands oil reserves were subject to speculation. Exploratory drilling seems to have started much later but if I find anything different, of course I shall report back.
3159 2018-05-29 19:10:43 If meat had an oil slick effect in my old reality, it meant it was rotting, not safe to eat, they say in this world it's safe to eat and u don't get sick, that just blows my mind honoustly, what kind of animal world is this? I am asking Dave Salmoni about this.
3160 2018-05-29 19:10:40 als je tea tree oil in huis hebt kan je dat mss nu al gebruiken.
3161 2018-05-29 19:10:34 Nunca cargué nafta en una estación Oil.
3162 2018-05-29 19:10:31 Nope! I spray a mixture of hair mayo, oils and water every morning and base with coconut oil twice a week

3166 2018-05-29 19:10:06 Is pure oil .... but tastes good
3167 2018-05-29 19:10:06 You can try peppermint oil on cotton balls around your yard and house. It's worked for me in the past without the need to deal with mouse corpses.
3168 2018-05-29 19:09:59 Sooooo, you’re saying you would blow guys while holding hemp oil in your mouth?
3169 2018-05-29 19:09:58 During @Ahmadinejad1956  time there was UN sponsored sanctions still India bought Oil and instead of paying money India sent foods of similar values.

3171 2018-05-29 19:09:45 Just greased my guitar strings in coconut oil
3172 2018-05-29 19:09:43 Excellent! cheese and panzanella it is. Will add a few drops of oil too  I may have to colour it otherwise it would be difficult to see each item if B&W, thanks 
3173 2018-05-29 19:09:40 Any on the jamaican black castor oil line?
3174 2018-05-29 19:09:36 It is a charade, Trudeau has wanted to nationalize the oil industry from the start.
3175 2018-05-29 19:09:30 It is fried yam why will it need oil, use your common sense
3176 2018-05-29 19:09:29 if u chug olive oil what happens
3177 2018-05-29 19:09:19 I’m so proud of myself. My ass really wanted to stay in bed but I forced myself to go to the DMV to get shit done and I got my oil change right before work, now I can feel a bit more at ease 
3178 2018-05-29 19:09:18 None of those products work for me. Hair was thinning until I started making my own product. Nothing bets water, sesseme seed oil and Irish moss gel. Add a few essential oils in there and you're good. Cheaper too.
3179 2018-05-29 19:09:10 Yeah we are usually less down here since this is where they drill the oil and refine it
3180 2018-05-29 19:09:09 More oil to tidewater. I know where Saskatchewan gets its money.
3181 2018-05-29 19:09:07 @VitalikButerin We need to bring awareness to companies extracting oil, gas , geo thermal from mother earth is causing 4.0 5.0 quakes to strike the extraction points.. Earth can only take so much of it before its to late. Wish I had a voice to wake people up to this!
3182 2018-05-29 19:09:01 Hey can anyone hear me??? Am I "Shadow Banned"???  
3183 2018-05-29 19:08:59 Just told my dad my car was making weird sounds and he said “Well when your power steering fluid, coolant, and oil are all super low, that happens Madison” YIKES.
3184 2018-05-29 19:08:59 Throw some wild growth and castor oil on there 
3185 2018-05-29 19:08:57 The Federal government is willing to bail out oil investors at $4.5 billion who made poor investment decisions, but wont bail out or force write downs on the student loans, credit card and mortgage debt drowning most Canadians struggling to get by. #KinderMorgan #bcpoli #canpoli
3186 2018-05-29 19:08:31 Get Red Cross toothache relief kit.  It has clove oil in it and works well until you get to your appointment.

3188 2018-05-29 19:08:27 @JustinTrudeau  Just like all addictions and junkies, our addiction to oil has made our government “sell our mother” to get a fix $$$. Ramshackle the ‘House’ to sell anything for its fix! and blame mother for their protests! @RachelNotley @bctoday @AlbertaatNoon
3189 2018-05-29 19:08:18 I sleep in a bath of olive oil and donkey milk. Simple!
3190 2018-05-29 19:08:17 That doesn't mean it's safe enough or that it's right to force a First Nations tribe to accept it going through their territory.  It's not like the oil sands are the last remaining source of petroleum in the world.

3194 2018-05-29 19:08:05 You just proved his problem with media; the brake issue was a very minor glitch that sensationalized media blows out of proportion compared against oil & gas sucking planet killing vehicles. Take the VW TDI fiasco that went down way too quietly in comparison!

3197 2018-05-29 19:07:52 I was shocked when I left at 16 that I wasn't working on an oil rig earning £75k
3198 2018-05-29 19:07:50 USA is there protecting their OIL!! How can you people be so naive?! Do you really believe your politics and your army really give a damn about those people?! Unbelievable!
3199 2018-05-29 19:07:48 All three of these issues could and should be settled with negotiation, not the courts. Besides, with a current losing streak of 16-0, the odds of the SC overturning lower court rulings are longer than the odds of an oil spill. Stop the madness!!
3200 2018-05-29 19:07:44 After nearly three years of ownership, I'm rather impressed with the durability of my Virago. In all this time the only issues I've had have been now a fork seal, an engine seal, a small oil leak and a short in the leads of my starter. Not bad for an under $1k bike.
3201 2018-05-29 19:07:42 He must know that is simply not true. The LOOP is a light oil facility that does not compete with Alberta heavy. For him to claim otherwise is simply ridiculous. #bcpoli

3203 2018-05-29 19:07:30 Jojoba oil is my favorite thing for my skin. 
3204 2018-05-29 19:07:25 I thought all this type of stuff fell under heading of " comedy?"
3205 2018-05-29 19:07:18 im sitting at subaru waiting for my oil change and the mechanic comes out and announces that there’s a live squirrel stuck in this dudes bumper. guy just responds “well yeah that’s why im here” 
3206 2018-05-29 19:07:17 oil is a doomed asset????

interesting perspective.
3207 2018-05-29 19:07:16 It would honestly be the same as licking or sucking a metal pipe. Lmao. And the jizz would be oil.
3208 2018-05-29 19:07:12 Oil Producing States won't allow that
3209 2018-05-29 19:07:11 Y’all it is so hot today that my mam just went to grab her coconut oil and it’s all melted into pure water, I can’t stop laughing!
3210 2018-05-29 19:07:10 As said lets shut down all fossil fuels right now this minute That means no food no ambulances no police no health care no jobs - oil 95% of everything - no housing no heating no industry no clothes no shipping or air travel no premature baby incubators that will please women
3211 2018-05-29 19:07:09 Nothing wrong with being against all those things. I am also- but when Islam is only bone you have in your mouth, whilst millions are being killed by west for oil/land/politics... then you've got your priorities mixed up. All religion is wrong -even the one that Theresa uses.
3212 2018-05-29 19:07:02 Sussss it’s soooo much more to stinulating hair growth. You have to take care of it. Getting your ends trimmed. Moisturizing. I use jojoba oil, mint almond oil and wild hair growth oil. Castor and coconut are sealing oils.
3213 2018-05-29 19:07:01 Ohhhh ok so the one with the oil slick on his head?
3214 2018-05-29 19:06:50 I know,  you are one of those who hate freedom.   You probably would like to see evil oil disappear,  even though it is used in more things than lubrication.

3216 2018-05-29 19:06:39 Ye flower store p nae plant nursery m lgte but I guess u talk about oil?
3217 2018-05-29 19:06:37 It looks to me that Oil was holding the LIBERAL REGIME captive after screwing up a record levels. Now it's pay or we're out!
3218 2018-05-29 19:06:34 Trudeau does have an energy policy. If you recall he said he wants Canada to get off oil.
3219 2018-05-29 19:06:31 It builds the economy of the country you live in........ Not using fossil fuels tomorrow isn’t realistic. I believe in a world without fossil fuels but that is 20-30-40 years away. The technology that oil & Gas provide will help us get to that point, it has to
3220 2018-05-29 19:06:23 for my decades and years in construction , mines and resources and oil and gas.....I shake my head .....................
3221 2018-05-29 19:06:15 @bctoday this morning you had a caller from Lytton suggest that BCs GDP is 70% resource based a quick search shows that oil and gas is in fact 3% of our GDP. I am sure when you add other natural resource GDP to that number you will find his numbers are way off. #misinformed
3222 2018-05-29 19:06:14 After today's decision to buy #KinderMorgan I would actually pose with @CanadianPM for a selfie. #cdnpoli Let's get some more fucking oil to tidewater. #StopKM

3224 2018-05-29 19:05:57 True, and the almost *zero*  likelihood of a significant oil spill is also still the same.
3225 2018-05-29 19:05:46 Olive oil is mono unsaturated which is better than poly unsaturated oils but an even better option would be coconut oil or ghee
3226 2018-05-29 19:05:35 Yup. DF @justintrudeau  we will sell it for half the price back to same oil company.
3227 2018-05-29 19:05:21 That is not true. The conditions imposed by NEB reduce the likelihood of a spill while the alternative (no pipeline expansion) dramatically increases the likelihood of a spill from all the oil-by-rail and US tankers. The Premier is ignoring important facts in his analysis #BCPoli
3228 2018-05-29 19:05:15 It’s 75% oil 25% bread and cheese... bone apple tea sister 
3229 2018-05-29 19:05:13 I kinda wish people put more effort into learning how things work. It's amazing what you can get away with you when understand how things work. Like mayo in pancakes because mayo is oil and egg
3230 2018-05-29 19:05:07 I would assume you are protesting only in bc or are you protesting the building of pipelines in the Middle East, Nigeria and Venezuela as well? If BC had some balls they would ban the importation of forgeign oil!
3231 2018-05-29 19:05:00 Oil jobs are not our future. Time to start planning for this reality and diversify
3232 2018-05-29 19:04:55 When I was relaxed my scalp was so oily, but now that I’m natural my hair soaks up every bit of oil from my scalp. 
3233 2018-05-29 19:04:47 shut your eyes and Dweet. The problems that come from ignoring servicing outweigh the current cost. Even if a just hangs you change Di oil 
3234 2018-05-29 19:04:44 I'm in the same boat, where parties on all sides have legitimate grievances. The biggest problem seems to be, even if the pipeline is perfect the oil tankers on the west coast are awful. The only way to prevent spills are to eliminate the tankers.
3235 2018-05-29 19:04:41 @adamcarolla @VinnieTortorich Started MCT Oil in the morning with coffee. Never felt better!
3236 2018-05-29 19:04:34 You all are a bunch of oil cry-btches.  Had anyone made a joke about hillary or Michelle u all would be screaming RACISTS, SEXIST,INTOLERANT.  he hypocrisy a truly astounding.
3237 2018-05-29 19:04:29 How is it that businesses feel they are entitled to a no risk deal and get it, while the average citizen must bear the brunt of no release from outrageous oil and gas prices. When was the last time the government funded our risk?
3238 2018-05-29 19:04:27 Government investing in the oil sector isn't unprecedented.
3239 2018-05-29 19:04:23 Interesting take on the future of Alberta's oil sector, especially given the #kindermorgan news today. I have no doubt AB can take the Vicar or Bray path forward.
3240 2018-05-29 19:04:20 Donald Trump campaigned that he would have "tremendous power" over gas prices.  Either a) he lied or b) he's using that power to help his oil buddies.
3241 2018-05-29 19:04:20 I'm confused. Are we buying the project from Kinder-Morgan?
This means we'd have a pipeline from ALTA oil fields to the BC coast where we could ship to customers? OR are we paying for the pipeline so that Kinder would profit from it ? #canpoli .

3247 2018-05-29 19:03:53 No @BlairKing_ca that is not what @Bill_Morneau and @jimcarr_wpg are saying today, absolutely no mention of this in their key points! It’s about jobs in the oil patch and getting AB oil to world market ie. Asia! Listen to what the people actually involved are saying!
3248 2018-05-29 19:03:53 put so much baby oil on,went out to lay on my sun lounger and nearly slipped straight back off it
3249 2018-05-29 19:03:38 I think back then they used oil that was made from fish hence "fish oil" and we couldn't change to "sunflower oil" or "olive oil"
3250 2018-05-29 19:03:35 Usually every few years or so. I adjust the surfaces first before looking at new equipment. An oil extraction can help too. Also good to clean your equipment after each use. Helps maintain motion and take oil and belt marks off the ball.
3251 2018-05-29 19:03:34 A little (like a 1/4 tsp) of coconut oil in your coffee/espresso will change your life.

3255 2018-05-29 19:03:10 What the hell does it matter? Your government is actually PAYING for a pipeline expansion that will kill our chances to cut GHGs by allowing oil sands expansion.

3262 2018-05-29 19:02:47 Oil prices continue to edge lower on ramped up production fears. WTI oil at $67.11/barrel, -$0.77.
3263 2018-05-29 19:02:25 Just so you know, that “seven fold increase” means the oil tanker traffic will go from next to nothing to hardly any.
3264 2018-05-29 19:02:20 They are more efficient in energy usage than using oil. (The larger the facility, the more efficient it is, generally.) Also, electricity has the potential to be green (wind, solar, hydro, geothermal), while oil isn’t at all. 15% green energy(and growing)>0%green energy
3265 2018-05-29 19:02:15 But you’re fine with Montreal pumping billions of litres of raw sewage into the St Lawrence & having Saudi & Nigerian oil tankers into your ports on a daily basis?

3268 2018-05-29 19:02:09 All you are saying is true. The goal is to reduce GHG consumption.  Oil isn’t the only issue.  I will add oil consumption on the west coast is increasing not decreasing.  Trainloads of oil and natural gas are flowing west right now. We are replacing trains with pipe.

3281 2018-05-29 19:01:12 @bctoday I want serious, concrete plans to make transition off oil in 20-30 years. Tripling oil works against this. This pipeline is to get every last drop out of ground. We are long past time of maximizing assets.  No need for pipeline if we plan reductions & build new economy.

3290 2018-05-29 19:00:54 We recommend to turn the unit on to speed 10 and let it run for 2 minutes. At the end of 2 minutes, turn off the mixer and wipe any excess oil from around the planetary action. If it begins to overheat or make any noises that it does not normally make, we would recommend service.

3295 2018-05-29 19:00:39 "So, government of Canada, I see you have an empty pipeline worth billions.  If you'd like us to ship some oil through it, you must reduce the taxes on our oil."

3297 2018-05-29 19:00:38 When you think about changing engine fluids, you probably immediately think of the oil, but don’t forget your transmission fluid. This fluid is vital to keeping your transmission turning smoothly (or at all), so it’s important to make sure it’s changed on schedule.
3298 2018-05-29 19:00:37 “I’m going to the protest against big oil!”

...Uh huh...
3299 2018-05-29 19:00:36 It’s appalling that the Canadian Government is willing to spend over $4 Billion of our tax dollars to buy a Texas oil company’s pipeline that massively increases climate pollution and puts tens of thousands of jobs and our coast at risk of oil spills. #cdnpoli
3300 2018-05-29 19:00:31 Liverpool do have history of selling to buy and as fans we hope to move past that. But if it means that we use money we have generated ourselves instead of having money pumped into our club (I. E oil money) then that's not cheque book imo

3354 2018-05-29 18:55:30 You're wel cum, love to ride on your swell Bike in all six gears, gag on your oil  and tasty briefs xx 
3355 2018-05-29 18:55:29 6 boiled green bananas, 1 pound ground turkey, 1 onion, garlic. pink salt red pepper olive oil... been eatin the same thing for weeks
3356 2018-05-29 18:55:24 But god forbid we have a pipeline spill a humungous 100 litres of oil which is cleaned up efficiently and quickly
3357 2018-05-29 18:55:20 Your skin produces oil to protect itself and when it feels like it’s dry or damaged, it will create more sebum (oil) to try and repair that skin. The more hydrated your skin is, the less oil it will produce. I’m not only an esthetician, but I also have hella oily/acne prone skin.
3358 2018-05-29 18:55:17 I never like to defend liberals but; @realDonaldTrump allowing export of crude oil and oil products helps our trade imbalance and also raises prices.

3360 2018-05-29 18:55:08 It's embarrassing when I have to warn the guy doing my oil change to lookout for my sisters hamster, bc she lost her in my car.
3361 2018-05-29 18:55:04 All you need is water and coconut oil anything else is unnecessary
3362 2018-05-29 18:55:02 Who are those ? They should come for some anointing oil.
3363 2018-05-29 18:54:59 Coconut oil gives my skin life 
3364 2018-05-29 18:54:35 chicks will love it, especially if you oil your chest and flex a bit
3365 2018-05-29 18:54:33 They want that oil.

3368 2018-05-29 18:54:23 Not interested in listening to oil addicts spout their nonsense again about the national interest. I’ll listen to some nice music and save my energy for the fight against the Notley-Trudeau pipeline company.
3369 2018-05-29 18:54:09 seems to be a straight up Guelph podcast, including the beard oil
3370 2018-05-29 18:54:05 Looking back at this comment, it looks like a creepy threat. Sometimes my sense of humor doesn't play over twitter. I am just referencing the fact that any time a country tries to trade oil in other than USD, suddenly an aircraft carrier strike group is parked outside their door.
3371 2018-05-29 18:54:01 just cover yourself In cooking oil it’s the same
3372 2018-05-29 18:54:00 Not commenting one way or the other on the efficacy of purchasing Kinder Morgan assets..... but Norway has a state owned oil company and they have no debt and a trillion $ in the bank.
3373 2018-05-29 18:53:47 We bomb brown kids for oil. @ABC doesn't mind that racism. They are tools. Hopefully another cable channel will pick it up.
3374 2018-05-29 18:53:44 Hiring any man that’ll take my car to get its oil changed because I really can’t deal with greasy flirtatious mechanics anymore
3375 2018-05-29 18:53:42 she's not an animal...she's one screwed up human being who can't think for herself and buys all the snake oil from the likes for Rush, Faux news, Jones
3376 2018-05-29 18:53:41 Full of people that don't believe in God Almighty who created all that is? It's friendly with Iran too, I'm sure. Maybe they're selling Iranian oil.
3377 2018-05-29 18:53:32 @channelstv flash back 2010 - 2015 economically privatization killed the economy because the government focused on oil alone which practically lead us to recession.
3378 2018-05-29 18:53:30 u mean oil
3379 2018-05-29 18:53:30 Your increase in gas prices have more to do with Obama not approving the oil pipe lines so we could get our oil to our refineys. We sell US oil at discounted rates uptown $17/barrel to other countries instead of using it our selves because of OBAMA.
3380 2018-05-29 18:53:25 @Nika_Howard that fish oil thing sounds brutal.  remind me not to get on your bad side.

3382 2018-05-29 18:53:17 There has been tons of talk about what the #Oilers should do with the 10th overall pick and other potential moves. That talk should be pushed aside for a moment and talk about a bigger issue:

Why on earth is Peter Chiarelli making personnel decisions for the Oil Kings?
3383 2018-05-29 18:53:16 I’m a licensed esthetician, so I’m not just a rando, telling you how to take care of your skin. I’m trying to give you my professional advice. You are creating more oil, by trying to strip it with something so harsh. You need to cut back on the toner and go HAM with moisturizer.
3384 2018-05-29 18:53:16 I'm having trouble keeping up here... The Rockafeller foundation is bankrolling Tides to keep Canadian oil landlocked because an unaffiliated investment co of the same name owns a liquid position in Exxon... so they're greasing the Mayor of Calgary to... Why? @FairQuestions ?

3395 2018-05-29 18:52:03 Being a PM when oil is $ 110 a barrel and when it is $40 dollar a barrel is like driving a tractor versus a Lamborghini. So when you are in your comfort zone but srilll won’t pass the benefit to the aam aadmi, what does anyone say?

3403 2018-05-29 18:51:22 I would throw up everytime they forced me to drink castor oil when I was young. Then I'd smell that shit for the next week 
3404 2018-05-29 18:51:16 I think it goes down like this...Kinder Morgan spilled 100 litres of oil yesterday. Environment Canada will fine them 4 billion dollars for this violation and the purchase is almost net zero to buy the company.
3405 2018-05-29 18:51:15 Back on track. Salad with canola oil & vinegar for lunch. Almonds for breakfast. Lo sodium sardines for elevenses.  Decaf coffee & a drop of half & half and water so far except for a sip of real tea and a sip of Kelly's coke & seltzer at lunch.

3414 2018-05-29 18:50:14 All western OIL should go to refineries in CANADA cut out the middle man.
3415 2018-05-29 18:50:07 "Transitioning away from oil won't happen overnight" is a refrain I've been hearing almost my entire adult life. I am 42.
3416 2018-05-29 18:50:02 It is the media so nothing surprises me anymore
3417 2018-05-29 18:50:00 Eggplant is good grilled with olive oil and garlic.
3418 2018-05-29 18:49:52 You won't hear @abc talk about how we bomb small brown children in Iraq and Libya for oil but not our white Scottish friends who have lots of oil. That's racism.  @ABC7 @ABC @ABC2020
3419 2018-05-29 18:49:51 So I changed the oil I usually put in the generator to what I use in the truck, Royal Purple. Truck runs awesome on it! Sadly it causes the generator to burn more gas, like a third more
3420 2018-05-29 18:49:41 I don’t know if I would say “its ok” that other stuff is shipped. I think there is a lot of opposition to what is already happening, so the idea of adding to it is unthinkable. It’s heartbreaking that there will be even more oil tankers added to an already crowded waterway.
3421 2018-05-29 18:49:38 It’s possible you’ve just never had good mayo. I used to loathe it, but I like good stuff without soy or canola oils in it. Try home-making some or try Primal Kitchen’s avocado oil mayo.

3423 2018-05-29 18:49:26 There are 8 refineries in Alberta.  To get the oil to refineries requires pipelines.
3424 2018-05-29 18:49:10 @bcalmanac how difficult would it be to clean up a full tanker? One speaker mentioned new technologies for cleaning up oil spills. What do your experts say?
3425 2018-05-29 18:49:00 yes well, that's a problem with it. also doesn't tell us if it is stocks bonds, oil, etc.

3427 2018-05-29 18:48:56 Still... Iran was still a democracy at that point, and the reason the British, helped by the US, destroyed a government, and install a butcher, was to keep access to oil. We can extrapolate to both being responsible for the Iranian situation today.
3428 2018-05-29 18:48:54 The Utah Division of Oil, Gas and Mining says it hasn’t received a single permit application for plots in the areas, as of Feb 2018. This is another failure of Trumps.

3430 2018-05-29 18:48:49 Oh honey, noooooo. You will regret this in a few years! Rubbing alcohol should NEVER be used on your face. It is one of the most drying things you can use.

3435 2018-05-29 18:48:39 @bcalmanac with regards to an oil spill, can experts tell us how difficult or easy would it be to clean a dilbit spill. I have heard that it usually floats at the top of the water for a week or two before it starts to sink. How difficult would it be to clean up half a tanker?
3436 2018-05-29 18:48:35 Israel has our oil? Time to invade!
3437 2018-05-29 18:48:29 I know which oils make cloudy and which make clear and use the correct dilution rate based on the oils used. Like coconut oil very soluble, soft oils like olive, safflower need a higher dilution rate and waxes like Jojoba and shea butter will make cloudy so use small percentage.
3438 2018-05-29 18:48:27 Why’s every white boy working at an oil place charming and cute but every white boy at a bar Satan’s literal son
3439 2018-05-29 18:48:26 Except Obama’s team were the only ones that could’ve done anything. What did they do? Spy without a warrant, then go after Page w/one over a bogus dossier charge that he & Sechin were working on 19% of Russian oil 4 lifting sanctions. Mueller found the 13 Russians later. No tie.

3454 2018-05-29 18:46:56 I just got the oil instead
3455 2018-05-29 18:46:48 The real explanation is that the oil companies know they have a License to Gouge from the Trump admin. Money in the GOP model only trickles UP—out of our pockets into the 1%’s.

3464 2018-05-29 18:45:51 1/12 Eating lunch as I write. Just as the Fed Govt nationalized West grain in 1947, Trudeau has nationalized west oil in 2018 #Cndpoli

3467 2018-05-29 18:45:40 Right! I have to laugh at our eastern provinces. They have no problems riding high off of the Alberta Oil industries transfer payments, but when it comes time to pay their share and contribute back to the west, it's a hell no.

3470 2018-05-29 18:45:20 John Lineham discovered and used private means to develop the first oil well in western Canada. Imperial oil spent millions drilling until Leduc. The govt helped with tax relief to further investment. The ratio of this would be 1000 to .001 private to tax dollars. You from here?

3475 2018-05-29 18:45:00 Well Dan, if it’s about what @Bill_Morneau and @jimcarr_wpg just said this morning, it’s about getting more for our oil than what we get from the USA... which will mean higher prices, not lower from the US refineries refining our gasoline!
3476 2018-05-29 18:44:58 He likes oil pipelines #JustinTrudeau
3477 2018-05-29 18:44:55 @bctoday @AlbertaatNoon I'm hearing a lot about the fact that we rely heavily on oil now and we can't just stop using it overnight, but expanding supply is not a good way to wane the demand for oil domestically or even globally.
3478 2018-05-29 18:44:53 Don't worry Dan, we aren't buying the LEFT's snakeoil they are always trying to sell through all the FAKE NEWS outlets. CNN being the leader of the pack. Their ratings are in the toilet& that speaks volumes.
3479 2018-05-29 18:44:51 @JustinTrudeau @liberal_party You’ve sold out Canada. Jekyll and Hyde. How can an oil pipeline be crucial to climate change commitments? You’re no better than @stephenharper and the @CPC_HQ. Shameful way to betray an entire province. Good luck on getting seats in BC next election
3480 2018-05-29 18:44:45 Correct: Hibernia oil field [Newfoundland] for one.
3481 2018-05-29 18:44:34 The lower prices in energy allowed Europe to grow a couple if years back, but the higher prices & ECB tightening at exactly the wrong time, have now caused problems. Lower Oil can save them, but higher Oil will continue to crush!
3482 2018-05-29 18:44:28 So, lets say the govt gets this pipeline built. So what's the plan? Are we setting up a company to market oil, a company that charges to transport oil, selling the pipeline, hiring a company to operate? Seems like a lot of questions not answered.

3485 2018-05-29 18:44:24 3/12 AB & SK own oil natural resources so the Govt will now regulate the sale of oil thru owning the pipeline. Denying licenses. Taxes
3486 2018-05-29 18:44:23 Init bro, don’t you need to read the Highway Code or oil your chain? Or do you get a kick out of trolling and preaching your saintly bile?

3492 2018-05-29 18:43:49 How long did it take him to realize that Canada is a resource-based economy and that it's bordering on criminal negligence to not build a pipeline to get our land-locked oil to market at top dollar? He's far too incompetent to be an effective PM
3493 2018-05-29 18:43:41 I seen the same interview, what kind of mind control are they using? Oh right Frequency, 20 missing Trunks of Tesla's work MISSING!!! We want all the info Freed!

3501 2018-05-29 18:43:12 I haven’t seen Rosanne Barr’s comments and I’d promise to stop watching her show but I have NEVER watched her show! She has always behaved like a slum lord. When she divorced Tom Arnold I felt she tried to destroy his career. Roseanne is a poor excuse for a Diva. Crude oil.
3502 2018-05-29 18:43:12 I've had my check engine light and oil light on for a few weeks....is that bad?
3503 2018-05-29 18:43:07 I’m a Liberal, but I also value the beauty & majesty of BC. In a forest, valley or mountain, I feel I’m in “God’s Country.” I wish God would repossess it. Businessmen have destroyed so much of natural beauty already. Air! Water! Fish! Soil!Polluted! Dependence on oil will decline
3504 2018-05-29 18:43:03 Step 2 is to get the East to stop buying all their oil from Saudi’s Arabia, and invest in Canada. Saudi’s  human rights abominations should be enough reason to cut off that supply.
3505 2018-05-29 18:43:00 #Roseanne  We bomb brown arab children's homes, schools, parents for oil. You won't hear @ABC saying that is racist.
3506 2018-05-29 18:42:58 2+ hours for an oil change is embarrassing
3507 2018-05-29 18:42:57 noe im sayin the eff are raising the key issue in that program of action which is the land issue,where am i mixing oil n water?
3508 2018-05-29 18:42:49 He won't!! I live here and he's in their pocket almost as much as the Big Oil companies. Are you paying attention to that as well?

3511 2018-05-29 18:42:16 Never hated my Countries Prime Minister and government more than I do at this time !!!
Billions of dollars paid to a Amercians oil company to build a pipe line we said we didn’t want or need ! I’m sickened by this !!!
And know I’m not the only one !

3513 2018-05-29 18:42:02 I really feel like I'm gonna have to slather my legs in baby oil to get a tan, these bitches so white and refuse to turn even a shade darker Smh
3514 2018-05-29 18:41:53 Trudeau and is liberals have said many times they want to keep the oil in the ground and they want Canada to be fossil free within years, there's no way this pipeline is ever being built no matter whose money they use.
3515 2018-05-29 18:41:50 This is about selling oil to Asia, not our own consumption Blair! Listen to what @Bill_Morneau and @jimcarr_wpg are saying today what @JustinTrudeau has been saying and what I’ve said from Day 1 of this debate. It has nothing to do with OUR society! #bcpoli #cdnpoli #vanpoli

3528 2018-05-29 18:40:38 Also I want talking about them, I'm talking about the owners of the big oil companies that he is willing to sacrifice the country for so they can drill and lay their pipelines and his elite friends he gave the biggest tax cuts to PERMANENTLY.
3529 2018-05-29 18:40:31 $4.5-5.4 BILLION taxpayer $ = Crown-Owned-Canadian-fed-gov-abuse-of-power used to force through the illegal KM pipeline. Oil that will be shipped to China threatens BC & benefits a Texas corp & U.S. Koch billionaires who own 1.5 Million Acres of Canadian oilsands.

3538 2018-05-29 18:39:57 It’s the squeaky wheel always getting the oil.
3539 2018-05-29 18:39:48 Sorry but building this pipeline is NOT tackling climate change. Letting oil sands emissions grow 40% is NOT tackling climate change.
3540 2018-05-29 18:39:38 #ChannelsForum how can we have these set of beautiful brains and still be in this worse economic situation, we must see beyond oil and focus on human capital
3541 2018-05-29 18:39:33 I think a carbon tax is sufficient in those cases (though not the existing one, which is much too low). But not in the case of the pipeline. The pipeline perpetuates our reliance on oil, which needs to end. It also makes our country an environmental pariah.

3545 2018-05-29 18:38:57 So, there's an interesting bug in Sonic 2 in the SEGA collection. I dunno if it's something in the original version or not. Entering the debug mode code in the standard options sound test actually makes Oil Ocean Zone's theme play over everything, overriding all sound.
3546 2018-05-29 18:38:56 Dilbit has been moving through our pipeline for past decade. We have not had a coastal spill. We already have oil tankers moving down our coast from Alaska. No spills. Federal government decision had to be made.
3547 2018-05-29 18:38:54 I think you're thinking of 30% oil of lemon eucalyptus, which has been shown to be effective. lemon juice is not the same and will not repel mosquitos
3548 2018-05-29 18:38:51 too much oil causes high blood pressure
3549 2018-05-29 18:38:51 Unfortunately, some ppl don't understand this. They know nothing about the economy. Most of the export is made to the west and most of the direct investment&credit come from the West. Unlike Turkey, Russia and Iran heavily relies on oil&gas and they don't have a huge pile of debt
3550 2018-05-29 18:38:33 Ecuador’s ARCH says country’s crude oil production was 522,373 barrels per day as of May 28, 2018.

3552 2018-05-29 18:38:25 You too failed here Miss Notley, because you are a reluctant convert to pipelines and the oil sands generally. We don’t need taxpayer money in this deal, we needed the constitution respected and rule of law enforced.

3563 2018-05-29 18:37:21 The only certainty is that another $2 Billion just went onto Alberta's debt tab. You stated that this gives us access to Asian markets & world price. With only AfraMax tankers at 80% capacity, can you show an expert opinion to back those two claims? @jkenney ask where oil ships.

3572 2018-05-29 18:36:39 The last two oil containment responses in BC (golden opportunities for your government to really show us you cared about our best interests) were thoughtless and careless. Yet you want us to trust your word that this project is in our national interest.

3576 2018-05-29 18:36:27 They say it’s in the “national interest” to get oil to international markets... which means shipping oil through Metro Vancouver to Asia for no good reason other than to allow them to spend even more of our tax dollars. Regret supporting up to now @kris_sims ?
3577 2018-05-29 18:36:26 When the old oil/jet fuel line was first built through this city there were not as many people as there are now and it's not safe. Our local fire department (assistant deputy chief used to work in the oil sands so he knows what  he is talking about) know how deeply risky this is.

3584 2018-05-29 18:35:40 Exactly, it is Canada’s oil so all Canada should be invested in it
3585 2018-05-29 18:35:37 Cons: We over contribute to confederation and never get anything back. We demand we get our fair share! 

Government: We'll spend $4.5B buy this pipeline for you to ensure it gets built so you can get your oil to tidewater

Cons: This is socialism! This is the worst thing ever
3586 2018-05-29 18:35:31 Thank you 
3587 2018-05-29 18:35:03 This is not vital to our national interest, its vital to a vocal minority with too much money and political/oil clout at stake.
3588 2018-05-29 18:34:57 That's great news ,wouldn't want that dirty oil to mix with the 130 million litres of raw sewage dumped into the sensitive Juan De Fuca ecosystem today and every day Victoria alone !

Do you think oil demands are about to drop in these regions any time soon
3599 2018-05-29 18:34:16 There is a definite appeal in that method

Unfortunately, when I checked the oil level, it was over full and I had paid some big bucks

This will likely cost the govt billions

3611 2018-05-29 18:33:27 #QP: Cullen: $3.2B to provide clean water for every kid living on reserve. Where are their priorities? All for a Texan oil company that they want to help out. Morneau: This is the way to ensure this project that actually happens and deal w/ squabbles btwn provinces #ableg #bcpoli
3612 2018-05-29 18:33:26 Got it!  Do not eat crude oil lol.
3613 2018-05-29 18:33:18 Hey, but I can't wait to tell the green wackos they now own the dirty oil pipeline from Alberta.  Ha, ha  
3614 2018-05-29 18:33:07 Seems that #ECN takeover by #TNO is still difficult..lots of people stating ....at ECN part of TNO..sometime ECN personnel will be hit by reality..you are part of TNO, worldwide known to do oil and gas ..one of the sectors which can be make money without subsidies! Maybe refocus
3615 2018-05-29 18:33:06 US Crude Oil Futures Settle At $66.73/Bbl, Down $1.15, 1.69 Pct
3616 2018-05-29 18:32:53 Umma be about my hair for as long as I want. I'll buy them butters n puddings till my hair looks like an oil rig.
3617 2018-05-29 18:32:48 OPEC & Russia announced that they will boost oil production so we could see a drop in prices, but let’s just hope Venezuelan crude production doesn’t collapse 
3618 2018-05-29 18:32:43 Apple cider vinegar and coconut oil  put both on and let it soak, the redness should be completely gone by the next day!

3620 2018-05-29 18:32:10 @ScottJAw has turned me to @lacroixwater and drinking the coconut is like making out with someone wearing suntan oil. I’m in love!
3621 2018-05-29 18:32:08 It trades at 3.8 EV/DACF on 2019E on US$60 WTI. Do you really think a higher oil price is needed?
3622 2018-05-29 18:31:47 My cars at Nissan for the day. New brake pads. & an Oil change. They’re fixing my heat shield because it’s loose, & they’re gonna see why my car is shifting weird. Also checking to make sure the wheels don’t need any parts replaced. 
3623 2018-05-29 18:31:46 This is one I am legit for.  We bought the Light Virgin oil for years.  Who keeps grocery store receipts?
3624 2018-05-29 18:31:40 Try bhigoe hue badaam in the morning, coconut oil for your head, machar jhol for your brain and super glue for your lips.  you’ll do a lot of us a big favour.
3625 2018-05-29 18:31:30 Furthermore, this means that its a national resource. National projects  can bypass most provincial legislations.  
Now, its federal money. Instead of spending it on the east we get a pipeline that will almost double our oil income (we will finally be par with mexico).
3626 2018-05-29 18:31:29 Neither for your hair. Mine got all dry and brittle! No coconut oil for me please!  
3627 2018-05-29 18:31:27 I take my vitamins and fish oil everyday and that shit really do be helping bc my body feel different when I forget to take them
3628 2018-05-29 18:31:14 As the world expands the demand is going to expand and so the production will have to expand also. A lot of people opposing expansion are not putting forward reasonable solutions to replace oil in our society.
3629 2018-05-29 18:31:14 So sorry to all employees of ABC and the unions who are going to lose their jobs due to Channing Dungey and personal grudge against Roseann Barr.  So sad.  Dungey has aspirations for top positon at network and thought this was her move.  She will be forced out within 2 years.
3630 2018-05-29 18:31:10 Girls are wild man...my natural scent at work is a blend of machine oil, soil, sweat and chemicals and the new girl just said I smell amazing
3631 2018-05-29 18:31:09 Man, tea tree oil has worked wonders for me! I’m sorry that wasn’t your experience!
3632 2018-05-29 18:31:07 9/12 Did Trudeau made a $deal whilst in California lately, to sell the pipeline to the sharks who pay for oil protests in  ? #cndpoli #lpc
3633 2018-05-29 18:31:06 @jimcramer @WarrenBuffetHQ u know for some reason Im a bit taken with the oil industry to an extent but it can be so volatile with a lot of risk involved and so many moving parts both domestically and abroad. I remember when the decline hit in starting in 2014 and continued
3634 2018-05-29 18:31:02 My skin so fuckin oily tf i don’t sweat out liquids i sweat out oil fuck
3635 2018-05-29 18:30:58 @findpatria I heard a gentleman on your show talking about water and oil based coolant for cars, it is a common myth. all car coolants are water based, and use ethylene glycol as lubricant, rust inhibitor & temp range extender ,the % of water & glycol is what makes difference
3636 2018-05-29 18:30:54 EFF is subscribe to Freedom Charter and PAC subscribe to Pan Africanism. You can't compare oil and water.
3637 2018-05-29 18:30:49 honestly never lmao call me crazy... but if I do only when the oil clear like with no lil burnt bits lmao
3638 2018-05-29 18:30:46 Had a flare on Sunday after eating at a food sensitivity-friendly restaurant (they only use avo oil, have tons of paleo/GF/dairy free/vegan/nut free options), trying to figure out what did it. Investigative GI fun.  #chronicillness #spoonie #moldillness
3639 2018-05-29 18:30:40 John also helped by huge income from oil exploration in the North Sea and establishment of a very effective sovereign fund.
3640 2018-05-29 18:30:33 After seeing that lady saying she only uses castor oil, coconut oil and water for her hair, I wanna try this. It’s cheap n hopefully it works. I buy anything n everything and end up not knowing, what makes my hair grow. Plus these products ain’t cheap.
3641 2018-05-29 18:30:33 why do so many places put orange oil in fortune cookies?! it ruins them!
3642 2018-05-29 18:30:32 well it's sorta like a basket-loading toaster oven. Unlike an oven, it blows hot air over the food so there's no preheating and gives everything you put in it a crispy exterior without any oil! great for most appetizers
3643 2018-05-29 18:30:13 Good commentary from @JackieForrest : This year alone, global oil consumption is projected to grow more than two times the proposed expanded capacity of Trans Mountain
3644 2018-05-29 18:30:11 EV don’t require nearly as much servicing. No oil changes and brakes last forever. EVs mean lost revenue for dealerships. They are in a conflict of interest.

3647 2018-05-29 18:29:59 Did you tell them we have oil?
3648 2018-05-29 18:29:57 Turkana youths and community need to be deeply informed on how the government of Kenya has planned to implement EOPS-ESIA, Land use, access and ownership content, Infrastructure and Investment plan before any oil activity starts

3651 2018-05-29 18:29:33 Don’t tell it to me....tell it to the companies still investing capital in the oil sands. 

For the record your narrative in this exchange had nothing to do with GHG’s...it was 100% about capital investment in the oil sands. Which I proved was continuing. Have a nice day
3652 2018-05-29 18:29:23 Don't care. It's BC that's going to have its pristine province marred by inevitable oil spils. Our province, our self determination.
3653 2018-05-29 18:29:16 I think most of the oil was certainly extracted in countries!
3654 2018-05-29 18:28:44 I used to have lashes that didn’t curl for anything. They literally went straight down and for the past like year I’ve been using castor oil on them and now they look like freaking boy lashes bc they’re so long and curl  SO PROUD OF THEM
3655 2018-05-29 18:28:43 So... Alberta conservatives are happy that the fed gov nationalized a pipeline so they can sell Canada’s oil to Communist Chinese? What a world!
3656 2018-05-29 18:28:42 Massive Long Liquidation in Brent Crude by Money Managers as yesterday released May 22 data of the exchanges. Guess sharp price cut has already told us about it. ;-)

3657 2018-05-29 18:28:26 It's 11:30 and I went to the gym, got a car wash, oil change, ate and showered....what now?
3658 2018-05-29 18:28:22 I get gov't is between a rock and a hard place on KM/oil industry.decisions as we're not ready for a transition away from fossil fuels .LNG extraction process is horrid as well Perhaps an equal investment/stake in a renewable energy company could be one way to balance the scales?
3659 2018-05-29 18:28:15 Retweeted AKSGNewMedia (@AksgNewMedia):

One sector which Emmanuel’s administration has become synonymous with is the area of industrialisation. For him, industrialising is the magic wand if the oil rich state is be to repositioned.
#UdomEmmanuelat3
3660 2018-05-29 18:28:05 is there connection between #ElonMusk bashing, you know the guy trying to help us get off fossil fuels, & the #DirtyFuel biz? What's that about? People reveling in his fines & pitfalls, while the oil & gas biz keep killing everything? Ok fake libertarian BS artists, lemme have it
3661 2018-05-29 18:28:05 My first car at 16 was 47 Studebaker. Bought it from my math teacher. Loved it but it burned more oil than used gas.#Memories.
3662 2018-05-29 18:27:55 If you think #KinderMorgan leaking #100litres the other day was a lot... think of the #thousands of litres of fuel/oil/chemicals #leaking everyday in car #accidents across the country. Avg SUV or truck holds 98litres. Safety measures worked! #BuildIt
3663 2018-05-29 18:27:53 .@bctoday @AlbertaatNoon at $4 Billion purchase price, $8 billion in build cost and $8 billion in projected climate costs - the taxpayers are looking at a $20 Billion investment in Oil at the end of the oil age. This is an #unmitigated disaster, especially for the #climate.

3665 2018-05-29 18:27:39 Caron: Why are the Liberals investing so little in green energy and so much in oil and gas? Morneau: We know this is in our best interests, we will continue to ensure our resources can be brought to international markets #hw
3666 2018-05-29 18:27:38 While working in the field I used to use a mix of baby oil, a liquid menthol solution (menticol), lemon tree leaves, and deet soap (nopikex). Worked pretty well... obviously with long sleeves and long pants (cause I got bitten even with clothes covering my skin)
3667 2018-05-29 18:27:09 why did the dude servicing my car just ask if I wanted synthetic or regular oil as if I actually know what that means 

look at me sir I don't even know how to open the hood of my car
3668 2018-05-29 18:27:04 massaging my scalp with castor oil is how i treat myself

3672 2018-05-29 18:27:01 बुरा न मानिए लेकिन मोदी भक्त नही अंधभक्त हैं।
2014 में crude oil $112 था, cong ने ₹83.72 में बेचा।
May 2018 में crude oil $68 ($59 average of may) वाला पेट्रॉल मोदी ने ₹86 में बेचा। 
बताइये same rate कैसे हुआ?
3673 2018-05-29 18:26:59 I need an oil change.
3674 2018-05-29 18:26:59 The world has been choking on oil since WWII and we keep trying to swallow more.
3675 2018-05-29 18:26:55 Just cut the Subsidy to the Oil Industry he'd Pay for it in what 5 to 6 months
3676 2018-05-29 18:26:48 Whatever happened to all the gas and oil we have as the #1 producer
3677 2018-05-29 18:26:40 Ha.  She is loser and will be out of ABC within 2 years.
3678 2018-05-29 18:26:35 Helima @CroftHelima If OPEC & Russia were to increase oil production to cover a decrease in Iran production due to US sanctions, total oil on the market would theoretically  be the same? Why would Oil prices drop due to possible increase in OPEC & Russia production?
3679 2018-05-29 18:26:30 At least she backs it up.  Ha
3680 2018-05-29 18:26:28 Uhm well since we are all here for the jokes. Happy Iftar to you all

3682 2018-05-29 18:26:20 My sister has been updating me and my brother on this bird she found in the backyard stuck in some glue while she was watering the plants. Her final update was that she freed it with some oil and I've never been more proud :')
3683 2018-05-29 18:26:19 Query:  If fish oil comes from fish, and olive oil comes from olives, where does baby oil come from?

3695 2018-05-29 18:25:34 The oil companies need to find it, pump it, transport it, refine it, transport it again and comply with tons of regulations. 
And yet people will pay $1.00 for a bottle of water.
3696 2018-05-29 18:25:32 I dnt agree with the minority this program is helping the whole country and we have to get our fair share of the oil.
3697 2018-05-29 18:25:30 Such as bathing appears to you - oil, sweat, dirt, filthy water, all disgusting - so is every part of life and everything.  Marcus Aurelius

3699 2018-05-29 18:25:16 I receive that admonition inconsistently; the last 1 related 2 the tractor. checking the oil level was OK. I forget what was not OK


3700 2018-05-29 18:25:15 bb try getting rose hip oil ! it does wonders
3701 2018-05-29 18:25:15 Probably saw a landrover and thought I can do that Difference is landys have supertanker volumes of oil so they can mark wherever they go Your lawn mower probably ran out after a few minutes 
3702 2018-05-29 18:25:13 Trudeau is Done. Fukking done!. Finished! Get rid of the small minded bourgeoisie. Dig it, clear-cut it, sell it all cheaply as raw material to foreign corporate overlords & oh yeah let’s kill the fishing, tourism industry for more nature-devastating, depreciating dirty oil $$$’s
3703 2018-05-29 18:25:09 Why do oil changes take all fucking day 
3704 2018-05-29 18:24:56 The wars in Iraq & Kuwait were fought to grab & keep the vast oil fields.

3709 2018-05-29 18:24:36 Off to follow up with my psychiatrist from my hospital stay. Then head to the dump, followed by DMV, then oil change
3710 2018-05-29 18:24:25 Apparently govt is spending too much of the oil money on the free education.  Waaaaa look. They've run out of things to object to
3711 2018-05-29 18:24:25 Fred Koch Sr- took his oil refining business to Russia, Stalinists and did business there bcs they had no intellectual properties laws. Made most money there before then building a refinery for the Nazi’s, with aproval from Hitler. Soro’s was 8 yrs old when that happened.
3712 2018-05-29 18:24:18 Lol consult your dictionary

3715 2018-05-29 18:24:10 Don’t you realize that the liberal government just made the first step to nationalizing Canada’s oil industry and you said “ I hope it works”  When are you going to walk the floor and join the NDP?
3716 2018-05-29 18:24:03 If they do that, than the jobs that will be lost by the oil path will be gained by the alternative energy sector.  But blocking for the sake of blocking just harms the economy more than it helps the alternative energy sector.  Here's hoping we see the proper shift by all parties
3717 2018-05-29 18:23:45 You are very right John.
Diluted Bitumen is nothing like crude oil.  A disaster will be far more horrific.
3718 2018-05-29 18:23:33 I don't understand why people got nicer to be upsetti have come! Me and I think you thing Virgin olive oil comes from???

3730 2018-05-29 18:22:30 the third one looks like an oil painting 
3731 2018-05-29 18:22:15 Not at all. NM needs to break free of the statist policies that have kept it back for so long. Our gov't is not hurting for money, oil is taking care of that. What we need is to restore our culture and enact policies that enhance the work ethic.
3732 2018-05-29 18:22:13 My whole issue with this is that Horgan and company haven't been willing to negotiate and haven't done anything to promote/help alternative energy sources.  If Canada/The World is to stop being so dependent on Oil, than governments need to overly support alternatives.
3733 2018-05-29 18:22:09 In what way are or was gullen worse then osama bin Ladin. If i remember correctly the only thing he has done is accusing erdogan of corruption. Hmm maybe becuse erdogan is corrupt. He didin’t even say that erdogan was buying Isis oil or liking Putins ass.  
3734 2018-05-29 18:22:08 Wrong way Justin...Canadian Oil 4 Canadians
3735 2018-05-29 18:22:02 the world is consuming more oil every day. fact.

3740 2018-05-29 18:21:49 Can you please show the graph of crude oil prices in last 10 years & petrol & Diesel prices in India in last 10 years. So that people of India can become more aware on how govt is looting them.
3741 2018-05-29 18:21:49 He’s a machine. Needed a lil oil change that’s all
3742 2018-05-29 18:21:43 Who told black ppl that cooking oil ke fish-oil?
3743 2018-05-29 18:21:34 My mom finally bought more tea tree oil! 
3744 2018-05-29 18:21:33 Lol... I’m here for the jokes also

U mean highly flammable?* 
3745 2018-05-29 18:21:21 How about all those tankers travelling by everyday from Alaska and all those tankers sitting just across the US border full of oil going to Washington State refineries. Are you asking for spill coverage? Why are you not trying to stop those tankers?
3746 2018-05-29 18:20:57 Today Km suckered the Feds and pipeline supporters into bailing the company out. Canada commits to more pollution, more oil spills and more maintenance on an aging pipeline infrastructure. Well done supporters.
3747 2018-05-29 18:20:52 Been at car place for 3.5 hours. Car needed oil change, tire rotation, alignment, new belt... Plus other shit I can't afford today. But I'm starting to get hangry, and I have other errands to take care of before I leave town tomorrow, so they need to get me out of here.
3748 2018-05-29 18:20:44 @AlbertaatNoon If Canada hopes to have an oil industry they must get their product to market. International corporations won't expand the industry without it, and they won't spend money building a pipeline when they could simply expand elsewhere. It's the only way forward.
3749 2018-05-29 18:20:41 Crude Oil 
66.62-1.26 (-1.86%)
3750 2018-05-29 18:20:32 [comms brainstorm] don't laugh, but my grappling hook is jammed and i'm stuck hanging over the oil reservoir, please help
3751 2018-05-29 18:20:27 And other essential public goods and infrastructure, like natural gas, oil, forestry etc @ShellToSea

3753 2018-05-29 18:20:15 It’s possible but they have played straight with the oil industry. The state owned Azergold is likely to buy AAZ eventually but perhaps not until explo work is further on. Hopefully it will be a fair deal 
3754 2018-05-29 18:20:02 Engineers lowkey pervert the sciences. Practicality is great and I fuck with it but I don’t fuck with “practicality” under capitalism.

Mfs will build more efficient ways to find oil or clean up spills before putting money into alternatives that’ll leave that shut in the past.

3757 2018-05-29 18:19:47 Here I am again, pissed that at the merest hint of oil prices rising, Gas shoots up like a rocket but confirmed oil price drops take eons to hit pump prices
3758 2018-05-29 18:19:40 Try rick simpson oil shit works wonders
3759 2018-05-29 18:19:27 "Pissing oil leak"  RIP Dorothy 
3760 2018-05-29 18:19:15 Yeah, when oil prices go up they’ll stop jailing the opposition and putting down unions and people will be able to afford bread. Then it’ll all be cool. 
3761 2018-05-29 18:19:09 みんなで油祭りしようよ。英訳するとオイルフェスティバル。
3762 2018-05-29 18:19:06 you can infuse olive oil & coconut oil/butter with rso and use it with anything you cook with although you'd be better off with infused butter or oil to start with. rso has a taste that might not go well with other things. making it infused with oil makes for easier dosing though
3763 2018-05-29 18:19:04 I'm Oil Can Harry! And I'm Roar!
3764 2018-05-29 18:19:04 For others who are looking for the elixir of victory, it is found in the oil that is churned out of the word of God. #RHFC #OilOfVictory #YouAreShining #2018  #RevJoe #fb
3765 2018-05-29 18:18:58 Not surprising. We're now all deluged with entities seeking feedback. "How was your trip? Rate the hotel? How'd that oil change go? Would you take our quick survey on your experience? How can we improve? Sign up for discounts? Want our newsletter?" No, just please go away.
3766 2018-05-29 18:18:52 Faith and sense are like oil and water. Both have their place and purpose,  but they cannot be mixed.
3767 2018-05-29 18:18:50 And he did it with fertilizer and fuel oil. Not a gun.
3768 2018-05-29 18:18:31 hahahahahahahahahahaha sna oil
3769 2018-05-29 18:18:19 @IfuEnnada  please am not team natural hair..can the hair growth oil work for my hair???
3770 2018-05-29 18:18:07 Argan oil or grape seed oil! Just a tiny bit all over after a shower is what I do. Or just put the littlest bit between your fingers and rub the flyaways though them. Sometimes it takes some trial and error to find which oil your hair type likes best 
3771 2018-05-29 18:17:58 Similar traits of bitumen and oil: black, burns well, pollutes good, mixes in well with ground and water when pipelines burst, so not very comparable.

3773 2018-05-29 18:17:46 the second best thing is Brooklax and that's trash + it doesn't work. so my suggestion to you is that you just drink Castor oil once.
3774 2018-05-29 18:17:41 It’s a must I get me some more oil growth 
3775 2018-05-29 18:17:40 I dont want pipelines built either. But we are not able to use only renewable resources yet. Infrastructure is not there. Pipelines and oil are a necessary evil until we can get off of oil. And thats still 10 years away at least. Maybe 20.
3776 2018-05-29 18:17:34 So the young Trudummy and his fellow Libtards are on the same path as his father, if you have forgotten or simply didn't know his father wanted to Nationalize the oil industry in the 80's (Petro Canada) this could actually be the beginning of the end for Alberta Oil.....
3777 2018-05-29 18:17:30 The argument in my piece is no secret in the federal government. I just wish they'd be open about all this. People may disagree, but oil sands > climate targets is a legitimate policy choice. Just be honest that a choice is being made!
3778 2018-05-29 18:17:27 Foods containing trans fats are primarily in processed foods made with trans fat from partially hydrogenated oil. #Bad #Cholesterol #LDL
3779 2018-05-29 18:17:18 *mayo has not, however, been enhanced by soy oil. Even Hellmanns now using 100% soy... and there’s been distinct degradation in my opinion. I hear Trader Joe’s has some alternatives which I may try...
3780 2018-05-29 18:17:10 #ableg #abed #cdnpoli It is estimated by activist @KHayhoe that the world will run out of oil in 150years. Oil shortages will drive up the price to make green energy r&d vitally important. In the meantime Can outcompeting conflict oil from terror states is the right thing to do.
3781 2018-05-29 18:17:07 Longer chain alkanes are denser than water: they will sink. An ecosystem has few (if any) tools to decompose crude oil. Heavy metals are chelated and oxidized by various O-containing molecules. You can buy uranium oxide. It's really not dangerous.
3782 2018-05-29 18:16:55 Yes, it varies but roughly omega 6 wins with a 16/1 or 28/1 ratio. I highly recommend not much high heat cooking as all fat becomes damaged (inflammatory) at high heat, however avocado oil, coconut oil, macadamia nut oil, lard, tallow or ghee are all excellent choices. Thanks. :)
3783 2018-05-29 18:16:54 O yapa.
Your lubricating oil, asphalt, heavy oil etc, not leaving behind petrochemical, fertilizers, plastics etc
3784 2018-05-29 18:16:43 @JustinTrudeau 4.5 Billions + another 10-15 billions to build  the pipeline and then we will resell for 5 billions to private! Since when gvnmts are in oil business? will we have Petrocanada again?
3785 2018-05-29 18:16:37 67 months would still be off the mark imo , the growth would be near instant - 100% of oil instead of 9% , all taxes retained instead of for upcoming WP upgrade , hs2 brexit , and trident.

But then that dont sell the union narrative.
3786 2018-05-29 18:16:36 So you just need some batter and some oil, and you’re in business!
3787 2018-05-29 18:16:36 what a fucking waste of 4.5 bill. I hope this pipeline is never built. Keep BC green and oil spill free!
3788 2018-05-29 18:16:35 No. It did not have to be done! Trudeau should enforce federal jurisdiction instead of having the citizens pay for an oil pipeline! Would have been much cheaper! But that would have required sock boy to do his job! Liberal way is to cut a cheque! Shameful
3789 2018-05-29 18:16:32 Peppermint oil will keep mice out of your house. I put it on cotton balls around and the house smells nice and the mice are gone!
3790 2018-05-29 18:16:25 This has got to be satire.  Right?

Although on the face of it,  water contaminated with bitumen and oil is probably safer that what they have to drink now.
3791 2018-05-29 18:16:22 Girl I can change your oil
3792 2018-05-29 18:16:20 Em 2006, a Petrobras pagou US$ 360 milhões por 50% da refinaria (US$ 190 milhões pelos papéis e US$ 170 milhões pelo petróleo que estava em Pasadena). O valor é muito superior ao pago um ano antes pela belga Astra Oil pela refinaria inteira: US$ 42,5 milhões.
3793 2018-05-29 18:16:20 Given that USA is still a net importer of oil and transportation is the largest sector.of emissions in the US right now, reductions there would improve US trade balance.
3794 2018-05-29 18:16:00 I really do hate KFC. The smell of the oil alone sick my stomach.
3795 2018-05-29 18:16:00 That Box be slippery like trying to walk on oil
3796 2018-05-29 18:15:55 I love the dermalogica oil free matte spf 30 :-)
3797 2018-05-29 18:15:49 Unless you're Greek. Greeks eat fried potatoes two times A DAY most days... guess maybe it's the olive oil they fry them in...
3798 2018-05-29 18:15:47 Well, until oil demands drop sha.
3799 2018-05-29 18:15:23 Wlh there's one Lagos guy there,shamo took me to,the guy dey try,but all those khakaki na wash
3800 2018-05-29 18:15:21 Love the way the car drives after an oil change 
3801 2018-05-29 18:15:21 And some people swear by Avon's  
Skin So Soft products like their Original Dry Oil Body Spray. Contains citronella
3802 2018-05-29 18:15:15 Supply and demand.  It may stink but we vacationers are to blame.  Not “big oil.”  And, yep, I just got back from a 4 day trip.  8 hours 1 way.
3803 2018-05-29 18:15:05 I need someone to oil my scalp 
3804 2018-05-29 18:14:57 Abby dyer has an oil painting of her and Edward Cullen in her room from when she wis 10
3805 2018-05-29 18:14:40 Hopefully they will sell shares to Canadians. I for one would invest.We,as a country will need oil for at least another 15 years,until we create the infrastructure for renewable.We will still need the LNG.
3806 2018-05-29 18:14:40 you're taking part of an interview with him out of context. that does not equal proof. he was a child during the war, and did what he had to in order to survive. you're an adult who is willing to believe snake oil salesmen and liars in order to support your messed up views.
3807 2018-05-29 18:14:37 Yes there is a Federal economy made up of several sectors and activities from agric to oil and gas to services etc. All these activities are indeed represented in the 36 state economies. Unfortunately, the GDP for these 36 States are not computed. If done, they are not released.
3808 2018-05-29 18:14:34 Anyone that bashes the transportation of oil is a hypocrite, unless they ride a horse and stay warm by crawling inside a ton ton.
3809 2018-05-29 18:14:21 This nonsense car is mixing oil and water damnit
3810 2018-05-29 18:14:15 150 years ago, most people saw their barber to have teeth pulled and snake oil salesmen traveled the roads and folk Medicine was curing and killing at random. But science...
3811 2018-05-29 18:14:06 @PlantTherapy Quick question, I want to expand my oil collection (and am thrilled you brought back the MySet Sale) what are couple options to get me beyond novice/begginer oils?
3812 2018-05-29 18:13:43 They’re going to start going down soon. Russia and the other large oil producers agreed to speed up and increase oil production and the prices per barrel are going down
3813 2018-05-29 18:13:30 Well its impossible to transfer our entire economy into a green one at the snap of a finger, we still need the oil and gas industry to keep things afloat until better options are created, which this govt i believe is trying to do. Canadas economy needs this pipeline
3814 2018-05-29 18:13:26 Like Axe Oil.
3815 2018-05-29 18:13:22 This guy at the oil change place is cute as hell. Lord help me.
3816 2018-05-29 18:13:17 Trump cannot even honor those who gave their lives for our country without selling snake oil, touting his own phony accomplishments, boasting his self aggrandizing lies.  Great Presidents lift the country up, not themselves, and thereby become great. Trump is all about himself.

3821 2018-05-29 18:12:56 So why are we worried, are we not exporting oil now?  And still $3 gal persists, one would think it was rigged!
3822 2018-05-29 18:12:27 CBD oil is great so far n I don’t think i’m as anxious as I used to be but it never feels like I actually sleep bc of the crazy ass dreams it gives me
3823 2018-05-29 18:12:22 Baking soda and water, add just enough to turn it to a paste and it becomes a great, gentle, totally natural, CHEAP exfoliating scrub. If you’re prone to dryness, add oil instead of water.
3824 2018-05-29 18:12:13 You want to send these oil billionaires a real message vote their lap dog Dan Patrick out of office.  Until he's gone Public Schools are not safe.
3825 2018-05-29 18:12:08 To anyone who wants to @ me and mansplain our dependency on oil, save yourself the hassle and just unfollow me. I'm not interested in your shit today.
3826 2018-05-29 18:12:08 Right? Let's remove our dependency on plastic & cheap Asian products. These idiots go after oil and gas, and ignore the fact we import $48 billion worth of merchandise, $2.14 billion in consumer goods. Worried about a carbon footprint? Support local.

3835 2018-05-29 18:11:11 is your oil changed yet?
3836 2018-05-29 18:11:08 Put Jamaican Black Castor Oil on your bottom and top lash line. I do it every night before bed and it has helped my lashes grow to the point where I don't even use mascara, just an eyelash curler. Coconut oil works too, just not as well.
3837 2018-05-29 18:11:07 It's actually First Nations Constitutional Rights and smart investors backing out that derailed the #KM project. But big oil and it's whores don't seem to give a sh*t about their legal rights or the environment. #climatechange #ProtectOurCoast
3838 2018-05-29 18:11:04 If gold stocks were however imperfectly, following the business/credit cycle like they always have in the post 71 era, it would be obvious that the gold price was reasonably legit. But it's been the exact opposite. Even with low oil prices, gold miners can't swim.

3840 2018-05-29 18:11:03 That's why it is used as varnish, especially linseed oil. Don't drink it!

3846 2018-05-29 18:10:25 My car has low oil pressure and I JUST had an oil change. Either they didn’t tighten the cap or it’s stripped.
3847 2018-05-29 18:10:22 Sir in Bihar & some parts of North east people are buying petrol from Nepal & Bhutan irony is that both buying oil from us difficult to get in to the logic. ..? Then How comes sahi And saaf niyath

3859 2018-05-29 18:09:35 Reasons why pipeline is not a good idea: so few jobs developed, infrastructure is were money needs to be spent, bitumen is not oil, pipelines were never designed for filthy  bitumen and now we have really screwed up the natural ecology of the prairies
3860 2018-05-29 18:09:32 Maybe the only difference now is that the big oil bought the government and got paid for it.

3882 2018-05-29 18:06:54 Wrong! Oil prices spiked in 2008 under Bush. Gas where I live was $4.20 a gallon and when oil prices crashed along with the market it went down to $1.70 a gallon. It krept back up to just over $2 a gallon and that’s where it stayed...Until now!
3883 2018-05-29 18:06:51 hilarious watching @andrewscheer tie himself in knots over gov't decision to buy a temporary stake in KM after months of him railing against it's "failure" to support Alta's oil workers..I am against gov't decision but to watch the hypocrisy of CPC and NDP is nauseating....

3889 2018-05-29 18:06:36 The federal government now adds oil to its business ventures, which also includes tobacco, gambling and alcohol.  What a legacy for future generations.
3890 2018-05-29 18:06:27 The resulting mass unemployment was unnecessary and paid-for by what were supposed to be windfall North Sea oil revenues, which were consequentially squandered. And she had the cheek to sanction that "Labour isn't working" poster.

3901 2018-05-29 18:05:20 The price of oil/gas is up, yes, partly due to demand, but Saudi Arabia needs $ so they have been lowering production; they have a war to fight & a country to run with not many other revenue streams to pay for it all.
The dollar has also been going up & summer is almost here.
3902 2018-05-29 18:05:13 In Tacoma getting an oil change & I’m starving! Lol

3904 2018-05-29 18:05:00 Are u personally going to come and clean up the oil that spills , that ruins our environment & kills our wild life and our sea creatures and our beautiful coast?

3910 2018-05-29 18:04:43 Two major recessions, the early eighties, early nineties

Selling British industries to foreigners

Squandering the revenue from north sea oil to pay for the dogma of her policies.

The Poll Tax - where a duke paid the same amount of money as a dustman... fair? I hardly think so
3911 2018-05-29 18:04:34 Hyperbole much? You should try to learn the difference between an oil pipeline and a blowout one mile below the surface of the ocean.

3914 2018-05-29 18:04:29 And after the $4.5B for universal childcare runs out, and our oil still doesn't have a pipeline to get it to market, how are we gonna fund childcare? What would be the source of revenue?

Do you understand basic business concepts?

3916 2018-05-29 18:04:29 I know. Long story. I had to unexpectedly run for about a 1/4 mile. No, cops were not after me lol. I’ll just say I’m a band parent.
3917 2018-05-29 18:04:28 With all the money in this country, we really had to wait for Dangote to build an oil refinery lmaooooo.

Needs to start getting my unborn children ready to marry into that family.
3918 2018-05-29 18:04:21 Also I agree we use a lot of oil and that won't change soon. Hopefully we can lower consumption with electric vehicles etc, but plastics + all the rest are around until we find a viable alternative. But Kinder Morgan has been clear the new pipeline won't be easing Canadian needs.
3919 2018-05-29 18:04:19 you mean he's not running across the aisle to hug the PM for getting the job done for the ragtag, destitute oil biz?
3920 2018-05-29 18:04:18 And oil is rocketing.tomorrow u must give us update and send notification to prime minister

3922 2018-05-29 18:04:05 @JustinTrudeau this decision is not OK. The future of Canada is not in Alberta’s oil sands, it is in clean and sustainable energy sources that will bring jobs for decades to come. #StopKM

3925 2018-05-29 18:03:59 Yep, you.
You do realise oil only makes up 3 to 4% of the UK’s electricity provision? As well as not realizing the crash in Sterling. 
Get out a bit more!
3926 2018-05-29 18:03:49 @JamesLokwale @HonLomenen @hrw . Off leaders forcing  the TURKANA community not to demonstrate before the EOT if flag off by the president. There is a lot at stake and if not discussed before hand the oil will be a curse to our land. Governments never listens to diplomacy.
3927 2018-05-29 18:03:44 Liberal oil+gas critic @Mike_A_Bernier asks why Horgan continued with "reckless actions that are going to cost all Canadians money" when he knew BC could not stop #TransMountain. Horgan says Bernier should take it up with Minister Morneau #bcpoli
3928 2018-05-29 18:03:43 Keep fighting @ElizabethMay .  The voters are watching. These oil companies have to go and people have to wise up and realize these places only care about their own profit. It barely, if ever helps the local community
3929 2018-05-29 18:03:43 When you say nobody is asking to cease all production you must know that is incorrect. There are many who want no oil being produced. How they expect everything else to go on as usual I am unclear.
3930 2018-05-29 18:03:40 I got an allergic reaction to tanning oil and I'm so mad because for once in my life I actually put it on
3931 2018-05-29 18:03:31 For the last 5 days International crude oil prices have fallen down. But Modi Govt has not taken any action
3932 2018-05-29 18:03:25 Not the reason, trump’s buddies lowered the price of their oil to make it look like he knows what he is doing. FAKE.
3933 2018-05-29 18:03:11 This is wrong. C'mon give me a break. GREEDY oil companies are to blame. They are fast freinds with Trump.
3934 2018-05-29 18:03:01 I ain’t gonna freeze or starve like everybody else who believes in green energy, maybe in 50 years theirs some renewable source of energy until then oil and gas all the way!
3935 2018-05-29 18:02:45 Picked up some vitamin E oil for my skin. I’m really needing to buckle down on a consistent skin care routine 
3936 2018-05-29 18:02:42 I’m glad that Dangote’s oil refinery would help with unemployment in Nigeria.

3 years after a minor oil spill in Vancouver's waters, we are still fighting to recover our costs - $550,000 - from the Federal Government's Ship-Source Oil Pollution Fund. A recent offer from the Federal Fund was less than 30% of our clean-up costs.

3949 2018-05-29 18:01:31 After taking out oil from mustard seeds the remaining dry waste of it can be burnt and then put into water keeping your hand near it to vaporise. Later the same waste can be taken out of water and the same can be applied as an ointment to the affected area.
3950 2018-05-29 18:01:31 Omg he has so many things to say about El Segundo. Did you know you work under a massive oil refinery? That you breathe sulfuric acid? That it's the richest city in California and they're going to raise the city on stilts so the rich don't have to breathe the air?

3954 2018-05-29 18:01:06 You must be insane. First the falling oil prices have in fact hurt the Russian economy since that is the only export they have. So they have been making significantly less money. See the connection.
3955 2018-05-29 18:01:05 It’s actually based on oil production.They tell us it slowed,so they charge us more,so I thought I’d slow my production down too!LOL

3982 2018-05-29 17:59:16 Needed long term solution to support Canada  & Alberta economies. If this improves marketability & price of Alberta oil, then payback will come in improved GDP. No pipeline would been worse. Best of bad situation.

If you’re keeping a natural hair, coconut oil or any other kind of oil will snap your hair. 
Also, anything you put on your hair after putting oil on it, will not penetrate because oil is a sealant. 
Putting coconut oil on your hair would attract dirt.
3992 2018-05-29 17:58:23 Why not stand up to Ryan Zinke and his attempt to destroy our national parks? Photos like this won't look nearly as wonderful with mines destroying the mountains or oil wells in the foreground.

4003 2018-05-29 17:57:02 My legs, calves had the hardest time today. Best part is getting to my place & treating them to @YivaniNaturals Massage Muscle Oil. I guess we got to work for those legs, not sometimes but always. Thank you Yivani for the best oils. Love 
4004 2018-05-29 17:57:00 @therealroseanne You behave as a traitor to the precepts of liberty, which include respect, honesty and restraint and do not include spewing foul venom and purveying snake oil to gullible citizens @disney @abc @Lawrence @CNN @realDonaldTrump
4005 2018-05-29 17:56:58 my favorite one from like 10 years ago was "using a turkey baster, write sexy words on his back in massage oil and make him guess what they are"

*me crouching over my bf with a turkey baster, oil literally everywhere, squinting in concentration*: D O N G
4006 2018-05-29 17:56:54 Had such high hopes for Trudeau govt. This is a travesty, using tax $$ to bail out a Texas corp losing money. I never want to hear the words "national interest" ever again. Especially applied to leaky tar oil pipes to China with zero chance of profitability. #cdnpoli
4007 2018-05-29 17:56:42 Prob couldn't wait to get to the pub for chips and oil  *I'll get my coat*
4008 2018-05-29 17:56:40 It is amazing for taking off makeup. Sometimes I use a cotton ball with coconut oil to take off all my makeup and then wash it off.
4009 2018-05-29 17:56:34 That makes no sense. Demand and use have not increased, wages have not increased. Gas is up because oil went up in anticipation of sanctions against Iran, which haven't happened. It's profiteering, which used to be illegal.
4010 2018-05-29 17:56:33 “Several whales have come in upon this coast (Fife) Anno 1652, one eighty feet in length of the whale-bone kind came in, which (as I was informed), besides a vast quantity of oil, did afford 500 weight of baleen.
4011 2018-05-29 17:56:10 Bro, people of this area are suffering from an unfortunate situation. All their waters are polluted with oil spill.
No fish exists here anymore
You can only see some funny kind of crabs.
Well at every krick.
Their source of livelihood is just Bunckry and stipends from the oil co

4013 2018-05-29 17:56:02 It was a naive decision, the kind that you can make with zero life experience and the belief that things always somehow, some way will work out. But as of now, things were working out. I was using the journalism experience to write this book and traveling across the country.
4014 2018-05-29 17:55:50 Like putting baby oil on before putting on heels
4015 2018-05-29 17:55:43 Bobby and some Russian oil man go do business
4016 2018-05-29 17:55:35 Castor oil, coconut oil, argon oil...

Not the one you drink though...I’m just imagining that it would inspire vomiting 
4017 2018-05-29 17:55:20 trump is no doubt up to something with elections. Putin does not want a Dem majority, that will fahk up his whole plan to get rid of sanctions and get and sell as much oil as he can!

4022 2018-05-29 17:55:04 I'm not an oil industry expert, so I have to ask: is federal/provincial subsidization of the industry not par for the course? Did it not help get Trans Mountain 1 built in the '50s? Bring the oil sands to what they are today? Help bolster offshore in Newfoundland?
4023 2018-05-29 17:54:57 So avocado oil is now a thing. Certainly no guac of interest in avocados these days eh? 
4024 2018-05-29 17:54:52 What a day.

• #Brent oil drops below $75 a barrel/#WTI down 9% this week after hitting a 2 year high
4025 2018-05-29 17:54:46 Hey Canadians you just baught an oil pipeline , howww cooll is that.
4026 2018-05-29 17:54:34 why does my jeep have to have synthetic oil its so expensive 
4027 2018-05-29 17:54:32 If i say regular oil change bitch i mean regular oil change and das et.
4028 2018-05-29 17:54:28 @CBCStephenQuinn  Canada can't refine it at a high enough profit margin to make oil corporations want to do it. Export baby. #KinderMorgan #cdnpoli
4029 2018-05-29 17:54:22 He should go for it so the owners finally come to their senses and see how much multibillion dollar snake oil they have been sold by Roger Goodell.
4030 2018-05-29 17:54:20 Massaging my own legs with baby oil cos why not? Self love init 
4031 2018-05-29 17:54:19 This hashtag is to protest the amount of oil we buy from the Middle East and the weapons the we sell to them that are used back on our people #stopsupplyingME
4032 2018-05-29 17:54:17 Trudeau is the guy who wanted to shut down the oil sands. Now he is going to be in charge of the pipelines? That's not good.
4033 2018-05-29 17:54:16 Shiyqsa u see me in d street,I go as far as fage to get a better one,but I gave up,saina dawo lag
4034 2018-05-29 17:54:15 Yes he does, he worked as a teacher, bouncer, snowboard instructor, he worked volunteer work with katimavik working in fn reserves, unlike harper whos daddy had to get him a job st oil corp, tgen he proceeded to stab all his nentors in back.
4035 2018-05-29 17:54:09 The same rules don’t apply to liberals, apparently.
4036 2018-05-29 17:54:00 Pure Coconut oil. It will change your life.
4037 2018-05-29 17:54:00 If you don’t own Avocado Oil or grape seed oil than you need to get you some. Your skin and hair will love you. You’re welcome in advance 
4038 2018-05-29 17:53:49 2.- What the majority of Vancouverites wish, it’s not to have the pipeline going through residential area as the current one it already doing.  It is human request of humanity over oil and on the second level very close, environmental protection.
4039 2018-05-29 17:53:37 And capitalist horrors - when an oil company decides a few billion isn't enough profit to make it worth keeping your husband at work, so they shut down their bitumen mine, and people start killing themselves because they feel so hopeless.

PEOPLE BEFORE PROFIT
Canada before KM
4040 2018-05-29 17:53:32 Never buying cologne from the oil bar in Polaris ever again 
4041 2018-05-29 17:53:31 My bf gave me an oil massage and is making me mashed potatoes because I’ve been emotionally in pain lately. He is good boy and I love

4045 2018-05-29 17:53:06 “Where are you from?”

“Indiana”

“Where at in Indiana?”

“Where is that by”

“Mitchell, Paoli, French Lick, Bedford” 

“Where are those?” 

“Lucas Oil Stadium. I live in Lucas Oil Stadium. Where the Colts play.”
4046 2018-05-29 17:53:04 I can't wait until electric cars are a mainstream thing so that we can give a big middle finger to oil and gas company's for marking up prices so much.
4047 2018-05-29 17:52:56 It does seem like a very strong oil; I could see how it might burn more sensitive skin :( I'm sorry!
4048 2018-05-29 17:52:46 This cake business has more profit than oil business.
Spend 5k and get 20k 
4049 2018-05-29 17:52:43 No one (reasonable) is advocating for extremes. Opposing expansion of oil markets is the bare minimum when faced with the science. What we have now: a world economy driven by a single, finite, toxic resource. That's the extreme.
4050 2018-05-29 17:52:31 This whole narrative of "create and protect jobs" in the oil industry has GOT TO GO. It's a dying industry, and rightfully so, and it's time we stop pretending that buying more pipelines and resorting to fracking as a method of extraction will save those jobs long-term.
4051 2018-05-29 17:52:29 I deadass put coconut oil btwn my thighs so they can stop rubbing together and it didn’t help 
4052 2018-05-29 17:52:28 i oil up everyday and this daughter of mines still manages to give me these tiger stripes .
4053 2018-05-29 17:52:20 Clearly that cod liver oil has taken its toll on your ability to type, Luke.

4055 2018-05-29 17:52:15 Lol you've seen a lot indai keche,no be today,are u a rep of my village people 
4056 2018-05-29 17:52:13 They are. I got the Worc Sauce tip from a pub chef. Makes a big difference. Veggies can use Henderson’s from Sheffield, v similar but will have to make do with bland cooking oil.
4057 2018-05-29 17:52:11 Do you like raw fennel? Thinly sliced, with some thinly sliced red onion, grapefruit sections, squeeze of lemon juice, olive oil. So so good. Goes real well with fish.
4058 2018-05-29 17:51:52 need to burn midnight oil hahais
4059 2018-05-29 17:51:51 So, @JustinTrudeau, you have a couple billion lying around for pipeline purchases, eh? I expect at least that much spent to save BC coastal businesses and environment (and KM should match that $ for $) when the inevitable oil spills come. We'll remember. #canpoli
4060 2018-05-29 17:51:43 Not to mention that Obama supported the Iranian regime in their flooding the market with oil to purposefully tank the prices in order to financially cripple Saudi. In other words; He supported the destabilization of the world market and threatened peace in the region.
4061 2018-05-29 17:51:42 I'm not sure it'll be *that* bad, but yes, RE has been propping up the GDP for a bit now. Oil would be a tried-and-true stopgap solution.
4062 2018-05-29 17:51:41 it makes your spuds seem fancy, you could do the same except add the oil to a fryin pan with the seasoning and crushed garlic then throw the spuds in that
4063 2018-05-29 17:51:20 The 1% funded + distorted the studies of many of those 3%  climate change deniers.  Unregulated capitalism has no ethics.  Laws that protect people, animals + the environment take away from their bottom line.   Follow the money... or oil as the case may be.
4064 2018-05-29 17:51:09 it needs oil.
4065 2018-05-29 17:50:46 You know you’re old when you see crazy food videos/post & think that’s way to much sugar! all that oil? ALL THAT into your body?
4066 2018-05-29 17:50:43 jojoba oil 
4067 2018-05-29 17:50:40 I used to make mostly pasta dishes. I like olive oil but hate olives. But since I'm over 400# making pasta isn't an option since I still want to fit into my chair at work. Mostly meats (skewered or otherwise) and fish when I cook now. Or, you know, a huge-ass stack of pancakes.
4068 2018-05-29 17:50:39 3 years after a minor oil spill in Vancouver's waters, we are still fighting to recover our costs - $550,000 - from the Federal Government's Ship-Source Oil Pollution Fund. A recent offer from the Federal Fund was less than 30% of our clean-up costs. #vanpoli #bcpoli #cdnpoli
4069 2018-05-29 17:50:33 oil prices are cyclic, up right now in the short term, but when they go down again (as the long term trend indicates)  because of falling demand. tar sand extraction will be too expensive for the market. We're buying a white elephant. Why would conservatives endorse corp welfare?
4070 2018-05-29 17:50:27 I only smoke blunts when I’m with the homies, other than that I’m always twistin up papers or smoking oil
4071 2018-05-29 17:50:12 In other words ,you don't want 
4072 2018-05-29 17:50:11 People always ask me how did I get my hair to grow. Plain and simple. Did/Do not touch it often, and I only started putting oil on my scalp last year. Which was my 3rd year being natural. However everyone's hair is different. Just worked for me.
4073 2018-05-29 17:49:58 @nailogical I just made nail oil pens! 

Quick question: can you refill them? If so, how?
4074 2018-05-29 17:49:57 Oil supports: $66.66, $65.30-$64.24, $61.68-$62.58
4075 2018-05-29 17:49:48 I thought when Obama was in office we were to be independed from Saudi or Middle East oil?? What happened to all of that...
4076 2018-05-29 17:49:44 Economic leaders don’t invest money in an industry without much of a future either. Even the Saudi Government is looking at selling their state owned oil company yet the Canadian Government thinks that investing in oil is a good idea.
4077 2018-05-29 17:49:43 @IndianOilcl excellent service from Indian oil .when we going for fuel sales manager says everytime sir there is no power.try to use toilet no toilet sir .want some air pressure no air sir .if you can't fullfill customer service than why you open petrol pump.
4078 2018-05-29 17:49:41 WCS, or Diluted Bitumen moved on existing Trans Mountain onto Tankers, and shipped out of the Country. It sells at a discount to WTI, because it is not Oil! Why will shipping more DilBit make the price go up? Look up definition of Bitumen. It is not OIL! Upgrade in Canada!
4079 2018-05-29 17:49:41 I haven't yet tried CBD oil, legal here. I wish FL would go full recreational, and we're working on it. I'd love to try edibles—I understand that they last longer. Still, I hear it's not nearly as effective for someone with off-the-chart pain. I know smoking it isn't.
4080 2018-05-29 17:49:34 let economics decide and have market forces stop it...plenty of oil still being used, demand is still there, once it is not it is not...then that will be it.
4081 2018-05-29 17:49:26 Obama's administration turn the oil prices down to try to fuck up Russia's economy.

Didn't work. Instead of it, backfired!

Now things is returning to its normality.

4097 2018-05-29 17:48:14 Maaaaybe just send them a dozen donuts. Or send a 1000 ppl each with a dozen donuts to sit and eat them all during normal business hours causing all The Whos in WHOville to step over the donut eaters in order to conduct the business of telling me what to do with my own donuts.
4098 2018-05-29 17:48:01 When it was 140$/ barrel fuel prices were still low compared to today's sky rocketing prices. Why the benefits weren't passed on to the consumers when crude oil prices were all time low ? Stop fooling ppl. #ByeByeModi2019
4099 2018-05-29 17:47:55 my favourite way to have spuds atm is to just boil them cut up pretty small, preferably using baby spuds, then just pour a bit of olive oil on them with salt pepper n oregano, bash them around in the pot to fluff them a bit and that's it. spuds are the most powerful vegetable
4100 2018-05-29 17:47:51 Think of the oil shock in 2008 - even as output was tumbling the Fed was worried because inflation was up due to oil. That is typical of a supply shock imo.
4101 2018-05-29 17:47:51 Don't we have an oil glut????  I want lower gas prices!!!!  PLEASE don't do this to us just because the economy is better.  Not for everyone or RETIRED PEOPLE!!!
4102 2018-05-29 17:47:49 THIS JUST MEANS THAT AMERICA NEEDS TO UP THEIR OIL DRILLING. WE HAVE PLENTY OF OIL HERE TO TAKE CARE OF OUR NEEDS.

4108 2018-05-29 17:47:07 i'm not necessarily a bull...but in a rough tape David it is still a stock picker's market.  MU, NFLX, MOMO FB up...banks weak, and oil of course.  to just label the market is probably a mistake, in my opinion.
4109 2018-05-29 17:47:06 RBD - Punters love to speculate, when you are served cold hard facts you get cold hard reality, investors want that big 10-100 times move

GKP - reducing debt and increasing revenues, throwing off huge amount of cash at current levels, assuming oil and aim stays OK, SP rises

4116 2018-05-29 17:46:31 Trevor, will their still be a market, knowing that Alberta Bitumen is more expensive than the higher-quality oil being loaded into Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs) in the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP). VLCCs carry 4x the capacity of tankers loaded in Burnaby

4120 2018-05-29 17:46:18 How about " we ran out of bread " , I think it's up there with the oil.
4121 2018-05-29 17:46:16 Geo irony. The 1st big extinction event (photosynthesis! 2.4ish billion yrs ago) biomass became some of the oil  now driving our current extinction event.
4122 2018-05-29 17:46:12 Is this only oil money?
4123 2018-05-29 17:46:07 You think the oil sands are producing over a million barrels a day for Bunker “C” shipping usage?...I assure you there are many more uses and markets for it. Bunker oil will be inconsequential.
4124 2018-05-29 17:46:03 The sprays are great to use for grilling, frying or coating the pan when baking. Since the sprays are propellant and emulsifier free you can spray the oil directly onto your veggies + salads!
4125 2018-05-29 17:46:00 Very cool graph.
@NRamankutty: am I correct that "processing" (the reds) = "oil crop production into oils for human consumption & for industrial use, as well as protein dense cakes for animal feed"--i.e., some split between food/feed? Is this also where biofuel production falls?
4126 2018-05-29 17:46:00 Never in my household will we ever recycle oil.
4127 2018-05-29 17:45:58 I'm the same way--my meat is literally a bit of olive oil and a bunch of lemon pepper.

As far as the weeds around the pond--this is a reconstruction of a mess of a backyard I inherited from lazy prior homeowners. You couldn't see the back yard it was so overgrown. Efforting!

4129 2018-05-29 17:45:55 When oil was at $150 dollars a barrel we all were paying $1.40 a litre for gas  . Now it's at $70 dollars a barrel and we are paying $1.50 a litre  tune into @CTVNews at 4 pm where I’ll be commenting on pipeline announcement #cdnpoli
4130 2018-05-29 17:45:52 How much vegetable oil were they consuming? What kind of exercise were they getting? How does the death rate compare to same age people eating less or no protien? Total garbage study.
4131 2018-05-29 17:45:52 ive been wanting to switch to all organic. rn i use Cerave face wash sine i don’t want it to go to waste and i’m using witch hazel and rosehip oil to moisturize but my skin need an exfoliator badly :(
4132 2018-05-29 17:45:41 Oil prices may go down but gas prices won’t... corporate greed will be the ruin of this country.

4134 2018-05-29 17:45:34 Like everyone else, I, too, am waiting to see what kind of snake oil Todd Howard is trying to sell me.
4135 2018-05-29 17:45:31 Okay @DrTeals. Where can I find the avocado oil mineral soak? It has disappeared from the shelves!
4136 2018-05-29 17:45:23 I always pay $30 for a $20 oil change it’s bullshit .
4137 2018-05-29 17:45:19 Check your Transmission oil today.
4138 2018-05-29 17:45:19 Sir in Bihar & some parts of North east people are buying petrol from Nepal & Bhutan irony is that both buying oil from us difficult to get in to the logic. ..? Then where comes saaf niyath in people vikas
4139 2018-05-29 17:45:11 A Citreon 2CV with an oil leak once travelled 500 miles through Italy after its gearbox was filled with bananas
4140 2018-05-29 17:45:06 I hate my car because why does it take 6 quarts of oil so I’m always paying more for oil changes like wtf.
4141 2018-05-29 17:45:03 Coconut oil is the best for ur skin & hair
4142 2018-05-29 17:44:56 If we do, it won't be for the supposed nukes, it will be for the oil.
4143 2018-05-29 17:44:52 Nokia is not a natural resources so I don’t think we can compare that with crude oil
4144 2018-05-29 17:44:52 Egypt Oil & Gas Newspaper Gas Flaring Reduction Is Possible
4145 2018-05-29 17:44:46 isa lang ang tama sasanabi ng mga DDS. Ang OPEC nagdidikta ng crude oil prices  - base iyon sa production output and demand pero dahil sa TRAIN - mas tumaas ng husto ang gas prices at ang mga bilhin ay tumaas din. Tanga kasi mga DDS
4146 2018-05-29 17:44:29 ぽ！めちゃくちゃ可愛いよな
4147 2018-05-29 17:44:14 That wasn't the reason. In 1959 the US was worried about the spread of communism in Central and South America bcz of the new Cuban regime.
We were TOLD to keep importing Venezuelan oil to provide their gov stability.
4148 2018-05-29 17:44:13 I just made a 7:30 am appointment to get my oil changed tomorrow.... Karissa why
4149 2018-05-29 17:44:10 how come our concerns are not part of the federal conversation? you'd think we had nothing to lose. Don;t forget under harpers regs cleaning up oil spills are considered #greenjobs
4150 2018-05-29 17:44:10 Now they are going to try and flip it to another buyer. No one will take this investment as long as the Liberals are in power. Every business person knows Liberals will not support our oil industry or Western Canada.
4151 2018-05-29 17:44:01 Poor baby must miss his bunny (he threw him in oil so he's getting tons of fricken baths ugh)((stuffed animal)) he skipped lunch and cried and just ran and put himself to bed 
4152 2018-05-29 17:44:01 Oil is 95$a barrel to help out trumps friend putian
4153 2018-05-29 17:43:56 “Touching that monstrous bulk of the whale or ork we have received nothing certain. They grow exceeding fat, insomuch that an incredible quantity of oil will be extracted out of one whale.” —Ibid. “History of Life and Death.”
4154 2018-05-29 17:43:51 Can the sun come out so I can lather in tanning oil.
4155 2018-05-29 17:43:50 Good afternoon dk, thanks I watch it later when I have time, I'm in the middle of tuning up the lawn mower  oil changed, spark plug next, filter and I need to go buy gas 
4156 2018-05-29 17:43:48 i been taking cbd oil for sleep and now i got the shits like every morning i didnt ask for this
4157 2018-05-29 17:43:48 im going to go out & learn how to do my own oil change bc I’m a strong independent woman who needs no man! 
4158 2018-05-29 17:43:44 In all those previous cases and for other provincially owned pipeline networks in Canada, the state used ownership to advance oil and gas development. Same w #TMX to hopeful not long-term. Agree economics (+politics) much better in those cases and alternatives less attractive!
4159 2018-05-29 17:43:42 I think my mum would faint if I got a tattooo she will baff me with anointing oil everyday until it comes off cause she already hates piercings 
4160 2018-05-29 17:43:41 In my time in that program, I wrote for the school paper and interned for a startup online newspaper and quickly realized that this profession was not for me. At this point though, I wasn't going to switch again and just decided on getting the degree so I could finish up.
4161 2018-05-29 17:43:37 Yep, their Critical Infrastructure Protection Act, if passed unchallenged, will set a precedent and private oil pipelines could be codified as a public necessity. Penalties for trespass etc will carry ten times the fines they now do.
4162 2018-05-29 17:43:37 ... Gikwang's cooking skill too is just as hopeless lmao wHY IS HE MEDITATING TO OPEN THE OIL CONTAINER
4163 2018-05-29 17:43:29 Woody's Press Box on 54th Street is a bad bowling alley... Synthetic boards... Way too much oil on the lanes...
4164 2018-05-29 17:43:26 It can change but it can't change on as quickly as people would hope. The reality is that the world will always need to use oil in some capacity. What the world needs is a better balance of energy production. We go all solar then people will complain of the extensive mining
4165 2018-05-29 17:43:21 Backwoods and oil too
4166 2018-05-29 17:43:17 *Walks into jiffy lube*
Me: I just want an oil change today
Them: take a seat.... Queen?!
Me: *walks over*
Them: looks like you need a new air filter, windshield wipers are old, and your serpentine belt is cracking. I suggest we fix those 
Me: No. I just need an oil change 

4167 2018-05-29 17:43:17 In Canada, seals provide a variety of #sustainable products including #pelts, #meats and #oil. Other parts of the #seal, such as seal collagen, bones, claws, whiskers and teeth are utilized in the medical and craft industries #eatsealwearseal #supportsealing #nothingwasted
4168 2018-05-29 17:43:12 Since when have we gotten into nationalization of the oil biz? Govt is not business, nor should they be.
4169 2018-05-29 17:43:08 Sirji..petrol n diesel price kyun nhin ghata rahe ho jab crude oil sasta ho raha h....Give any reason?????
Its too much sahab ji. Stop
4170 2018-05-29 17:43:05 They still haven’t fixed the oil spill
4171 2018-05-29 17:43:04 WHAT? Guacamole without coriander isn't guacamole. Idea: just have an avocado with walnut oil drizzled over it.
4172 2018-05-29 17:43:00 Wonder why there is no oil in Flint...
4173 2018-05-29 17:42:44 got out of my oil short at around 66.40, waiting for a bounce to possibly short again - around 67.58?
4174 2018-05-29 17:42:35 Glad to see the best and brightest leading the way. Oil business should be easy for these Top Notch Minds and diverse backgrounds.
4175 2018-05-29 17:42:33 my jeep really gotta take this long for an oil change 
4176 2018-05-29 17:42:27 what great news. now we can stop the BS.
how about working on making electric cars available for purchase.This has to happen before we can end the flow of oil.Lets work at it but let's not n
be ridiculous
4177 2018-05-29 17:42:20 Oil vey.
4178 2018-05-29 17:42:13 Sir in Bihar & some parts of North east people are buying petrol from Nepal & Bhutan irony is that both buying oil from us difficult to get in to the logic. ..?
4179 2018-05-29 17:42:02 Can we do a quick back of the envelope calculation of how many wind turbines, solar panels or, heck, even bicycles $4.5 Billion would purchase? Don't forget to also factor in the money not spent on cleaning up the oil spills this disaster will create.
4180 2018-05-29 17:42:00 Y’all still adding coconut oil to your hair in the summer? Sis your hair is fried.

4183 2018-05-29 17:41:39 Yes Trump & Pompeo will not want another Cuba on his watch - nor will the Lima group of nations who are most adversely affected by this mafia regime on their doorstep - they have to force in aid convoys and  sanction all #Venezuela govt oil transactions that only benefit #Maduro!
4184 2018-05-29 17:41:39 @IndianOilcl Sir in Bihar & some parts of North east people are buying petrol from Nepal & Bhutan irony is that both buying oil from us difficult to get in to the logic. ..?
4185 2018-05-29 17:41:31 Crude oil, just like most commodities, is a risk asset. And so are emerging markets like India. They all usually tend to move in tandem over longer periods. Moreover impact of inflation needs to be considered too. Also crude denotes global growth n many Nifty sectors benefit 1/2
4186 2018-05-29 17:41:29 I could probably ketofy anything. I made ghauna with almond flour, stevia, and MCT oil. Boom. Keto ghauna.

4189 2018-05-29 17:41:22 So India today is Gas Surcharge and Tax for GST on oil products?
4190 2018-05-29 17:41:19 Doesn't bother me at all... just wish you'd answer the pointed questions... a firefighter where? In a city, on a boat, in an airport? On an oil rig? You see Sir, you love to speak in particulars except when it comes to your own experience & training.
4191 2018-05-29 17:41:18 Lol nobody is criticizing anyone's look,fr me its an advice fr them to wear their make up,I feel they look better,and I'm here fr d bants,nothing serious, I've bn dragged here,I didnt kill anyone, so excuse ur 'stupid' this ain't its place,I can be highly inflammable when need be
4192 2018-05-29 17:41:17 “Traumatized”. 

Can’t make this stuff up
4193 2018-05-29 17:41:13 use a cleanser that contains salicylic acid at 2% and also use a retinoid like differin. opt for oil free sunscreens like aveeno and you're good to go
4194 2018-05-29 17:41:08 Art, do you think the OPEC cuts are having a major effect on oil prices?
4195 2018-05-29 17:41:02 False dichotomy. The demand for oil is rising. Governments can use returns from the use of fossil fuels to fund investment in renewables.
4196 2018-05-29 17:41:01 Better than twenty million stupid jobless looking for a job with a state that exports oil and I think you know the truth 
4197 2018-05-29 17:40:59 Ok lets just burn midnight oil tonight
4198 2018-05-29 17:40:51 Thanks, bummed you aren’t making the 25 oil anymore. I will definitely try the new oil out.
4199 2018-05-29 17:40:47 Civil war had a reason and meaning. After WW2 USA just anhialated 3rd World countries, looted their oil and still putting sanctions and pressurising other countries. USA acting like a bully.
But civil war was different, I respect that. They faught for freedom.
4200 2018-05-29 17:40:44 Yes Trump & Pompeo will not want another Cuba on his watch - nor will the Lima group of nations who are most adversely affected by this mafia regime on their doorstep - they have to force in aid convoys - and  sanction all #Venezula govt oil transactions that only benefit #Maduro

4205 2018-05-29 17:40:25 Who is the carpetbagging donkey hoarder who advised the PM & Finance Minister to pay too much for a pipeline we don't need and the people don't want?
So, the Liberals want to be seen as the party of destroying our environment with a nationalized oil transportation system?
#StopKM
4206 2018-05-29 17:40:23 Then now we're really screwed.  The federal government has already shown how much they don't give a crap about oil spills in BC.  I hope @jjhorgan keeps on fighting for us.  @bcndp @JustinTrudeau

4209 2018-05-29 17:40:02 Perhaps UDOM could've been forgiven if he owed salaries like some other oil producing states,  after all oil wasn't selling.  But he's consistently never defaulted even with biscuit-flat IGR #Udom3YearsOfTouchingLives
4210 2018-05-29 17:39:59 They were lured into voting to leave by snake oil merchants and charlatans.
4211 2018-05-29 17:39:46 Running oil in tanker cars down the banks of the Fraser River isn't doing anything to save Orcas either. Ms May thinks risking BC wild salmon runs to a derailment in fast moving river is safer than a monitored pipeline.
4212 2018-05-29 17:39:42 get that high grade oil change, your suppose to change it every 3,000 miles or every 3 months
4213 2018-05-29 17:39:17 While sex trafficking of kids is a repugnancy beyond comprehension, what is even worse, is the fact that a demand in America exists, for sex with kids.

I think that the American perpetrators should be boiled alive in peanut oil! With Cajun seasoning!
4214 2018-05-29 17:39:10 #bcpoli @cknw @bc1 @simisara980 so why is the Pipeline going through Walnut Grove Langley - is that the new spur line to Washington State refineries ----One must ask " if we are not getting full Price from the Americans for Alberta oil = why ?"- sounds a little bit of a scam
4215 2018-05-29 17:39:05 @ABDanielleSmith At the end of the day, a government that absolutely hates Alberta and the oil & gas industry with a passion, now controls the infrastructure of that industry in that province. If Albertans think things are bad now, just wait, you ain't seen nothing yet.
4216 2018-05-29 17:38:55 Aunty I'm not judging anyone, so dnt take me seriously, I'm here fr d jokes at times.
4217 2018-05-29 17:38:48 Just coconut oil
4218 2018-05-29 17:38:47 yup! my parents ensured that all of their kids (male & female) could do basic household stuff: sewing, oil changes, cooking, laundry, etc. now, i never do it, but i know how. (my husband likes it more, so he does it.)
4219 2018-05-29 17:38:38 Uncle Femi Ote$, if this is truly you, then your narrative about Dangote refinery to be largest oil refinery in the world na BIG FAT LIE oooo.
Perhaps you meant in W/Africa. 
But in d world, it isn't sir but a refinery in India called Jamnagar refinery with 1.24mln barrel per day
4220 2018-05-29 17:38:30 Why American oil can keep booming despite crazy swings -
4221 2018-05-29 17:38:29 As soon as it’s built it will be “GIVEN” back to the Oil companies for next to nothing.
4222 2018-05-29 17:38:21 Liberals: "Oil is bad, we're going to impose carbon taxes on everyone"

Also Liberals: " We need to ensure we can continue to ship oil, as it's vital to our economy! Let's take 4.5 billion from everyone in Canada... But let's keep that carbon tax thing."

4223 2018-05-29 17:38:20 U know when you forget to put oil and water in your car for 3 months ... yeh same x
4224 2018-05-29 17:38:19 Add rosemary and good olive oil, it’s fab! 
4225 2018-05-29 17:38:19 Why buy up oil assets to do this? That’s billions that could be spent elsewhere.
4226 2018-05-29 17:38:17 I had a choice during the break up: The 2014 BMW or the 2000 Malibu. I took the Malibu. It’s easier to fix. Fuck that BMW. $1500 for brakes and an oil change is disrespectful. I grab a rental if I wanna be cute.
4227 2018-05-29 17:38:17 I adore it when stocks go down and oil goes up, like in 2008.
4228 2018-05-29 17:38:17 The oil that is found in poison ivy is called "urushiol."
4229 2018-05-29 17:38:13 While all of the major countries have decided to go the environmental route (Germany and rest of Europe and parts of Asia) #Canada just placed its bet on oil! Didn’t oil get us in this mess before @liberal_party were elected? #OhCanada
4230 2018-05-29 17:38:09 be careful with tea tree oil. it works on spots but can create pigment issues especially for skin of color.
4231 2018-05-29 17:38:09 I wonder why Permian companies aren’t viewing this as an opportunity to capitalize on being potential suppliers for gas injection projects - Gas Injection is a very effective enhanced oil recovery (EOR) method for increasing recovery rates from the reservoir after waterflooding.
4232 2018-05-29 17:38:07 @realDonaldTrump @larry_kudlow Martket DOWN 450 points- NOT GOOD FOR VOTES! U.S. stocks tumbled the most in a month, joining a global equity selloff sparked by concern Italy’s political woes will destabilize Europe. Treasuries surged, oil plunged and the yen rallied.

4236 2018-05-29 17:37:52 The market is softer than anyone predicted and the 3 largest financial institutions have all said they will no longer invest in new oil or oil infrastructure expansion.  8 countries have set dates to ban fossil fuel cars. The writing is on the wall.
4237 2018-05-29 17:37:48 socialist democrat trump and his liberal democrat kids using the White House to make better and  greater  business deals FOR Themselves while selling out America not just our jobs but land and oil is included in MANY favors trump owes Russia,China and Saudi

4243 2018-05-29 17:37:18 Sorry, Don. You’re wrong on this one. The pipeline will support jobs in oil and gas. All the other policies the feds and the Alberta govt have built around this issue (support for renewables, emissions reduction, Just Transitions etc) will create jobs beyond oil and gas.

4249 2018-05-29 17:37:03 The Italian political mess over the weekend just accelerated the sharp slides in the market, oil price and bond yields today. The real culprit is our simultaneous "open fronts" on trade. Right or wrong they tile the optimism of the markets and our precious 401(k)'s.

4261 2018-05-29 17:36:00 Ya because this team is so great at drafting!   How long dose the rebuild need to continue?   Trade it for a nhl ready d man.  Keep picking and keep sucking, while every other team passes the oil.   Best player in the world and still can’t get it figured out.
4262 2018-05-29 17:35:58 black cumin oil is LIFE
4263 2018-05-29 17:35:56 Dad just washed my car for me and got an oil change 
4264 2018-05-29 17:35:54 Waiting on an oil change. Bob Dylan is caterwauling in the corner on one side, and on the other there’s someone seemingly banging on the wall with a hammer? Neither is preferable. #SoloAStarWarsStory

4266 2018-05-29 17:35:52 Decisions motivated by politics are usually wrong decisions. Ottawa is payinghuge price for an aging Transmountain line, will incur great cost to twin it, and when it's all done pricy Alberta oil will have to be discounted to compete with cheaper, better world oil. @KinderMorgan
4267 2018-05-29 17:35:52 You don’t need to use so many expensive products on #NaturalHair My hair is waist length & I don’t even use oil or conditioner I only use 2 products shampoo & gel 
4268 2018-05-29 17:35:52 Its possible sis. You just have to find what works for you. The last 2 times I've colored my hair I put coconut oil on first. Then we made a hair mask with green tea and some other shit
4269 2018-05-29 17:35:51 “Climate change leaders don’t spend $4.5 B on oil pipelines.” @theJagmeetSingh #cdnpoli #bcpoli #stopkm
4270 2018-05-29 17:35:49 #CaosMonetario que expliquen como van a manejar los combustibles para vehículos (gasolina y gas oil) después de la reconversion monetaria, según se entiende la moneda más pequeña 0.50 céntimos es equivalente a 500 bolivares de hoy, el precio actual de la gasolina es de 1 bolívar
4271 2018-05-29 17:35:48 #kmpl : I have a question for the petro trade savvy. What sort of deals inhibit Canada from refining its own oil? Canada has supply, is fighting enviro regs to export raw product, and apparently CDN cars are burning Saudi gas. Wtf? Help a brutha out...
4272 2018-05-29 17:35:45 I've been thinking about it and come to the conclusion that buying the Trans-Mountain pipeline is genius. 

Why?

The middle class cannot afford homes.

Oil barons *can* afford homes.

Ergo, make every Canadian an oil baron. 

QED!
4273 2018-05-29 17:35:45 Following @DarrylCornelius advice I've roasted a packet of gnocchi in a tiny bit of oil and I will never eat them any other way again.
4274 2018-05-29 17:35:44 Slowly boiled in oil
4275 2018-05-29 17:35:41 Got some tires and the oil changed in the buggy and cut the grass now i day it’s time fir a nice popsicle and a cold shower then maybe an angry orchard!
4276 2018-05-29 17:35:38 Funny timing that the feds announce Kinder Morgan buyout the same day TSB presents #NathanEStewart investigation report to #Heiltsuk ahead of publication. Nice to know the gov’t explicitly knows the risk they put on Indigenous communities when they push an agenda of big oil.
4277 2018-05-29 17:35:36 All you need to do is read it in her voice to hear the flippant sarcasm oozing off every macadamia nut oil slicked word.
4278 2018-05-29 17:35:29 Bad bitch and she off the oil
4279 2018-05-29 17:35:28 $TXHE I been waiting toooo long , let's talk #oil start the convo here !
4280 2018-05-29 17:35:20 #CleanEnergy yes - Oil & gas, HECK NO! Minerals... Not sure. But we need to be moving towards more #trees and more #Sustainable energy. #ClimateAction
4281 2018-05-29 17:35:07 We have the third largest oil reserve on the planet, and global oil consumption grows every year. Do you really believe $4.5B in windmills and solar panels would have a long term return? Who do we sell the electricity to?
4282 2018-05-29 17:35:00 No more soda &I only corn tortillas.. also olive oil.
4283 2018-05-29 17:34:37 i need to change my oil asap 
4284 2018-05-29 17:34:36 You oppose the damn pipeline but are ok with tankers full of oil? Let’s call it what it is, you and the rest your province don’t care about the environment. If y’all don’t want that flow then we should oblige.
4285 2018-05-29 17:34:28 Gun oil
4286 2018-05-29 17:34:28 FTR, I never trusted him but lived in riding that previously elected oil loving finance minister Joe Oliver & only way 2 stop him, under broken FPTP false majority was vote LPC. It has never voted NDP/green. LPC lied they’d make every vote count, forming all party #erre committee
4287 2018-05-29 17:34:24 Seems government only really invests big bucks in “working people” and the “middle class” or “good jobs” when those investments are filtered (laundered?) through financial and big oil corporations. #neoliberalism #austerity #KinderMorgan #TransMountain #cdnpoli
4288 2018-05-29 17:34:15 Pake tea tree oil lama2 berasa kyk pake minyak kayu putih di muka wkwkwk
4289 2018-05-29 17:34:11 Agreed. Thanks for weighing in on a take that could have been more impactful had it not crashed and burned on an oil slick halfway through. If only more read @AlexRoy144 rather than that black gold goggled fool who’s clothed in a (once) resplendent Grey dress. @nytimes
4290 2018-05-29 17:34:02 Going organic with your skincare? Try clove oil on pimples. Dries them right up.
4291 2018-05-29 17:33:57 I seriously doubt that though, the game of politics of oil and renewables is a high stake one , improved  lot......yeah, take over......... a big doubt
4292 2018-05-29 17:33:50 @renoomokri I heard oil is now $80 per barrel, when it's was $65 during GEJ administration fuel was sold at 87naira. Why is the price of fuel not down yet?

4297 2018-05-29 17:33:33 up with the oil and lining up... And pushing in - ohgods ohgods ohgods that will never feel less - until he's sheathed in his lover and moaning softly at the sensation, dropping his face to press the sound into Gwaine's back*

4303 2018-05-29 17:33:01 i use tea tree oil on EVERYTHING. my piercings, in masks, as a spot treatment, on cuts, in my hair...it’s a holy grail.
4304 2018-05-29 17:32:50 I wonder if that fool, Trudeau has also agreed that we would be responsible for all oil spills in Canadian waters.
4305 2018-05-29 17:32:37 松岡修造なつかしいｗ
4306 2018-05-29 17:32:35 Omg don't say sorry! I'm not a mum at all! But we had nit trouble in my family my entire childhood (primary school teacher mum!) and tea tree oil worked here everything else had failed. We doused my hair with straight tea tree oil, left it for a bit and then washed it out
4307 2018-05-29 17:32:33  we wash hey!! Olive oil usually helps to get them cleaner.
4308 2018-05-29 17:32:19 Big Oil: the "Tweakers of the Corporate World"; they never stop bothering people with their "Tar Sands Tweaker stories", they are in your face everywhere, and they are ALWAYS looking for a free meal.

4311 2018-05-29 17:32:08 Oil source
4312 2018-05-29 17:32:04 Hey wait, wasn't it the NDP that always put "nationalize the oil industry" in their platforms?

They were just mimicking Chavez, though.

What's Trudeau's excuse?
4313 2018-05-29 17:32:02  Ya, the Liberal government LOVES the oil industry  the proof is in all the projects that have been cancelled on thier watch. They only started to care when it was obvious thier stance on pipelines was costing them a serious amount of votes. Get a grip.
4314 2018-05-29 17:32:02 Oil and water...I get it.

But you and I know better.

Imo all jurists should be excluded from party membership.
4315 2018-05-29 17:32:00 @Wawa Seriously why is soybean oil added to your lemonade?
4316 2018-05-29 17:31:43 Absolutely love the smell of coconut oil in my hair 
4317 2018-05-29 17:31:28 Owning a pipeline and not the oil is closer to owing the railway but not the grain.
4318 2018-05-29 17:31:24 coconut oil ain’t good for your skin
4319 2018-05-29 17:31:15 why hasn’t anybody told me that baby oil takes off old tan?? my life has literally changed
4320 2018-05-29 17:31:00 I was subjected to Fox and Friends while waiting on an oil change.   OMG it was as if I was in another country (Russia?) the way they were saying he was the greatest president ever and how all the liberal media were picking on him.  What #Snowflakes
4321 2018-05-29 17:30:46 Pag ganyan humihingi na ng lakas yan kay efficasent oil eh hahahahha
4322 2018-05-29 17:30:37 Went to get my oil changed and there was literally 12 people in front of me! Fml!!
4323 2018-05-29 17:30:29 Well said! I used to drive my dad's cart just to spend time with him. I also was under the hood of cars to get time! In fact before I could take my learner's permit test I had to know how/do change a tire, change the oil, check the oil, replace air filter, change washer fluid.
4324 2018-05-29 17:30:11 Apparently Weaver isn't concerned about possibly sacrificing the Iconic Fraser River and multiple wild salmon runs in the event of a derailment of hundreds of tanker cars running oil down it's banks. How do you clean an oil spill from a fast running river ?
4325 2018-05-29 17:30:10 Understanding implicit bias is not about learning to not have a bias, it’s about being aware of it and then changing your thought process and actions accordingly. Awareness is key.
4326 2018-05-29 17:29:43 If my brother forgets to get my oil and filter I'm gonna have a fucking cow
4327 2018-05-29 17:29:42 This is fucked up the rest of Canada gets what they want and, us BCers get fucked in the end.when the oil spill happens and it will. hope your happy you  fucking @JustinTrudeau you lying piece of shit!
4328 2018-05-29 17:29:39 “ Does my sassiness upset you? Why are you beset with gloom? 'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells Pumping in my living room.

4329 2018-05-29 17:29:38 We have a 250 year supply of coal in the US. How could it be worse for the environment than crude oil? Everyone wants solar. Its will come now that he is forcing China to manufacture panels in the US or pay huge tarriffs.
4330 2018-05-29 17:29:36 It's about them oils. Coconut oil, argan oil was what I was told. But I would even say tea tree oil.
4331 2018-05-29 17:29:26 Must try it. Though found an old bottle of bio oil in the press!
4332 2018-05-29 17:29:25 - Apply an oil or mask weekly
- Dry your hair with a microfiber cloth instead of a towel
- Use a heat protectant when blow drying, straightening or curling
- Drink water
- Massage your scalp daily
- Condition your hair every time you shampoo it and leave it in for 2 minutes
4333 2018-05-29 17:29:24 Nothing is worse than running out of olive oil while cooking.
4334 2018-05-29 17:29:20 speaking of which, this is about the time we start getting rumors of some macro shop blowing up, isn't it?  long the eur, long oil short UST's, not working too well the past week
4335 2018-05-29 17:29:14 The price of oil has nothing to do with PM Trudeau. Our economy is leading the G7 and yes, it does matter. I have lived the roller coaster of an oil and gas economy. Thank gawd someone with a brain came along to diversify our economy so we can thrive again.
4336 2018-05-29 17:29:14 Traumatized. lol
4337 2018-05-29 17:29:10 Aku pake sunflowers tp mix sama jojoba oil, jerawat di jidatku berkurang dan cerahin wajah juga.. butuh waktu sih ya gak instan (2-3 minggu)
4338 2018-05-29 17:29:09 Cheers man. Sprayed it leadbelcher. Washed bulb oil then painted on Mephiston Red
4339 2018-05-29 17:28:56 Venezuela has had its oil nationalized for long time, more than just one or two decades. many issues like a coup, devaluation and crime contributed way more than nationalized oil. As I said read up on history of the country , it was basket case of corruption etc..
4340 2018-05-29 17:28:54 Me too. My fave press briefing ever, in Deauville in June 2008, when Alexei Miller said oil would hit $250/b and nat gas in europe $1,500 by end of year. And that Gazprom would be first trillion-dollar company. Great days.
4341 2018-05-29 17:28:45 @Mthiya_SA  u R beautiful but stretch marks, tissue oil from celton and remove it
4342 2018-05-29 17:28:44 Shin splints (my excuse)
4343 2018-05-29 17:28:40 Takes car in for simple oil change...mechanics find something wrong...yep, that’s my life... #carprobs #storyofmylife #theusual
4344 2018-05-29 17:28:25 Jack Davis, “The Gulf: The Making of an American Sea” author, says oil was discovered in the #GulfofMexico by the Spanish in the 16th century, but companies didn’t organize to drill for #oil until the early 20th century. #GCL #SWFL #History
4345 2018-05-29 17:28:23 I don't believe the Trudeau government will ever build this pipeline. This has been orchestrated from the get-go and nationalizing the delivery of oil is the first step of the Trudeau / Butts plan to strand as much Canadian oil as possible.
4346 2018-05-29 17:28:20 いずれにしろ近い内に色々入れ替えが必要なようです(^^;)
4347 2018-05-29 17:28:16 Coarse ground coffee and coconut oil exfoliant!!!!!!!!!!!

4350 2018-05-29 17:27:42 Hit it with a hammer that's what I did with my GPU last night then put vegetable oil in it since I dind't have mineral oil.  Stupid fan bearing were going out. gonna have to order some new ones at some point.
4351 2018-05-29 17:27:41 I took my car service money and sent it home. So that's that. May the blood of Jesus be my oil.
4352 2018-05-29 17:27:36 Oil is getting crushed this week .. I am watching $ERX :)
4353 2018-05-29 17:27:28 The US strikes Syria, where Russia controls the oil flow into Europe so the best way to choke us is higher prices per barrel(less production)
4354 2018-05-29 17:27:28 @_I_AM_OIL_ せきゆさん掘りありです！
4355 2018-05-29 17:27:11 Yea let's look at the awesome policies in 10 years. Spending has increased permenent corp tax cuts. Let see what happens to the tax payers in 10 years. As well lowering fuel economy, how many years of oil is left and how high will it climb at the pump.
4356 2018-05-29 17:27:09 We can counter-Google each other all day long. End of the day, Canada's problems are not US problems. Also, women don't work mines, Mills, oil rigs, engineering, etc at the rate of men. Simply stated, these jobs pay better than what women typically go into.
4357 2018-05-29 17:27:09 did you use oil?
4358 2018-05-29 17:27:02 Your move @Ford, 2017 2.7 Ecoboost XLT Crew Cab 4th oil pan leak in 121 days!! All started on 8 Feb with 6,000 miles and has had 4 oil pans on the truck. Denied my buy back/replacement request the last time. It’s been 20 days since the last oil pan replacement!!
4359 2018-05-29 17:26:46 the alcohol is too much for my skin. but during breakout, which gave out too many oil, it helps in reducing them. love hate relationship, ugh.
4360 2018-05-29 17:26:45 After karnatka election oil prices are getting higher and higher every day. Bjp is quite with 21 state in India.
4361 2018-05-29 17:26:40 Dawn, don't know anything about refineries or pipelines, but I've always thought the oil patch was a great place for a lot young men to find a job and start a good path for life. No University education needed, out door work, male companions good $$, etc,
Wrong, right??
4362 2018-05-29 17:26:40 It’s good to know the Liberals said they didn’t have the money to bring clean drinking water to First Nations reserves but can buy an overvalued oil and gas company through corporate welfare.
4363 2018-05-29 17:26:37 Bingo. He’d never pick a side. He’s too liberal for that. And because he’s afraid of AB. Hard to surf in a Tofino oil slick tho!
4364 2018-05-29 17:26:26 Tea tree oil
4365 2018-05-29 17:26:26 Who's we?
Idiots?
Yes, the idiots racists & corporate kleptocrats found a snake oil salesmen around which to rally.
There's no accounting for the ultimate stupidity of the working class Republican voter; however, they continue voting against their own best interest.

Hate & fear?
4366 2018-05-29 17:26:24 Sir wating for petrol to complete century are 2019 general election  but oil is downward in international market so why upward here even dollar is stable then where is saf niyath in people vikas
4367 2018-05-29 17:26:23 Oh please Trump, NOT the victim tactic!! ‘Please, Sir, can I have more?’ (Con man never has enough)A free press is the only hope we have. The truth will set us free of this snake oil salesman. Write on!!
4368 2018-05-29 17:26:23 on my way with the olive oil
4369 2018-05-29 17:26:18 I'm so sleepy I thought my mom was drinking olive oil but it was actually beer
4370 2018-05-29 17:26:06 Tea tree oil!
4371 2018-05-29 17:26:03 I had no idea what I wanted to do in school but I liked movies and I liked writing. My 1st semester at Arizona State, I majored in creative writing and then the 2nd semester I switched to film. My grades in high school were awful but left to my own devices college was much easier
4372 2018-05-29 17:26:02 Why does @Wawa Lemonade have soybean oil in it?
4373 2018-05-29 17:26:02 So @dclivejazz got it even more wrong than that.
- @realDonaldTrump's tax plan RAISED the rate on the top tax bracket
- The plan also limited SALT deductions to $10k maximum,  so working class people in low and no state income tax states no longer subsidize wealthy taxpayers.
4374 2018-05-29 17:26:01 Just painted a true picture of one enclave they call Nigeria, a British plantation. The interest there is oil and never human life or human beings and every criminal is eager to be it's ruler and never it's leader.
4375 2018-05-29 17:25:43 Even more has been lost through our selling of discounted oil to the US.
4376 2018-05-29 17:25:42 Probably Arab oil money.

4379 2018-05-29 17:25:38 If it weren’t for those stupid democrats we could drill for oil in Alaska! 3.07 a gallon for gas is to much! Dumb democrats won’t allow us to do anything. Democrats are stupid idiots!
4380 2018-05-29 17:25:37 Sir wating for petrol to complete century are 2019 general election  but oil is downward in international market so why upward here even dollar is stable then where is saf niyath in people vikas
4381 2018-05-29 17:25:30 AMEN!!!

4383 2018-05-29 17:25:22 True. But recognize that oil is a major resource and Canada gets screwed as there is only one buyer. Pipeline important  to diversify. Debate should be focused on how to mitigate and reduce any risks....not on killing a major industry.
4384 2018-05-29 17:25:15 Bought some cbd oil yesterday to try and help my MS excerabation. So far in addition to my regular meds it is actually helping with the muscle spasticity and spasms, numbness, and the squeezing "MS Hug" symptoms. I think I might use it now in addition to my other meds from now on
4385 2018-05-29 17:25:13 Your cheap propaganda slogans don’t work with us in California Trump...we know your nothing but a snake oil salesman in a Chinese suit...
4386 2018-05-29 17:25:12 Higher oil prices mean more fracking # good for America ,less dependency on middle East oil,Saudi's increase oil production to kill US fracking they want us depending on there oil.
4387 2018-05-29 17:25:06 ok seriously, how do i not have tanning oil right now!!!
4388 2018-05-29 17:25:03 Do Oil Can Boyd, Dave Smith, Bob Knepper, Mark Wohlers, John Smoltz, etc. count as “innocent”?
4389 2018-05-29 17:25:02 This is very deceiving. It should have just #avocado oil, not added soybean. Try again!
4390 2018-05-29 17:24:54 Canada buys it's oil from Venezuela,why is it so expensive here.
4391 2018-05-29 17:24:50 I've only managed to get up to oil fluids and filters. The transmission I just hit with a wrench and cry...
4392 2018-05-29 17:24:45 #Oil prices crash by 8% in world market; in fact with alternative energy sources picking up, oil has only very limited scope left for prices to remain high as it will only push up the effort in renewable energy sector.
4393 2018-05-29 17:24:44 No offence, but the economic data (facts not project fear) speak for themselves. Has the pound devalued? Have import prices gone up? Transport costs? Oil based packaging prices? Shrinkflation in the shop! #SaveBritainStopBrexit
4394 2018-05-29 17:24:42 There are several factors that can cause a burning smell in your car, including the lack of transmission fluid. However, your engine can also be the culprit. In such case, check for the signs of oil leakage.
4395 2018-05-29 17:24:40 Who is paying @jjhorgan? Or perhaps he's just a puppet of Andrew Weaver. I can't suppose he is this dense for getting stuck on this one point of a very low-risk of a spill. #TransMountainPipeline While he is merrily shipping oil to Vancouver Island. #Hypocrite
4396 2018-05-29 17:24:39 I haven’t put tea tree oil on my face in like 2 weeks my skin is having a set back 
4397 2018-05-29 17:24:34 Getting the Jeeps oil changed before we chase today, already 6k miles on this trip! Wowzaa!
4398 2018-05-29 17:24:33 The demand for oil is inreasing by 1.4 million barrels a day now, and by 2million barrels by 2023.
4399 2018-05-29 17:24:33 Allowing Alberta oil to obtain higher prices via distribution thru pipeline, dispenses with fear of raising interest rates to cool housing simultaneously plunging Alberta into deeper recession.

4406 2018-05-29 17:23:52 Guess who used expired tanning oil yesterday in Tahoe and looks like Mr. Crabs now?? 

If you guessed me, you guessed correct. 
4407 2018-05-29 17:23:52 Before I started using this oil free soap I looked so greasy. I could've let someone fry chicken with it. Now I look like somebody crusty feet :(
4408 2018-05-29 17:23:51 That was before Moody’s told you (March 2017) that a separate Scotland would likely have a JUNK credit rating, and when you thought you could depend on oil revenue. Those days are past.

4412 2018-05-29 17:23:39 Hello, We were contacting you about your scroll compressor. We are under the impression you need the oil that didn't come with the product correct? Can you please send an email to "Order help" so we can solve your issue? thank you.
4413 2018-05-29 17:23:37 It never seems to amaze me how little the Robyn's of the world grasp when it comes an economy. AB has invested in other areas, but those areas got investment many cases due to oil. 

Secondly, oil is not disappearing anytime soon. Electrical cars are only 2% of vehicle sales
4414 2018-05-29 17:23:12 "We ran out of olive oil"

4415 2018-05-29 17:23:06 So I prolly shouldn’t have done this, but I bathed my dog with my curly hair products & now she smells like an agran oil goddess 
4416 2018-05-29 17:23:06 No because the option value to PMJT to be able to tell a Premier Kenney "no oil for you in my pipeline without a carbon tax" is waaaaaay higher than $5B #kindersurprise
4417 2018-05-29 17:23:04 I never really thought about what I would actually do as a grown up. Part of this was because I assumed I would be dead by 18. It wasn't that I was a super dark kid or anything, I just couldn't imagine myself beyond high school. It didn't seem like a viable possibility.

4427 2018-05-29 17:22:42 The majority of Canadians don’t live in BC,the majority won’t help with the oil spill,the vast majority of Canadians will forget about the spill after six months, the oil spill will still be there after 20years.BC earns over 15 billion dollars per year from tourism,now in danger.
4428 2018-05-29 17:22:40 I guess since the largest oil spill in the last twenty years was from a ferry you would agreed that all ferry traffic between the island and mainland BC should be stopped.
4429 2018-05-29 17:22:35 Oil barrels - I suspect it's a first step to complete ODAB-500 implementation in 4x4 version. And even without preliminary oil dispersal at final blast point it's already a very nasty development.

4446 2018-05-29 17:21:09 Since when did Walmart do oil changes?? i will never understand Hollywood
4447 2018-05-29 17:21:04 US oil is $65 US a barrel this month, giving the industry a boost after the market collapsed three years ago. The oil sector hasn't seen these prices since late 2014, but most companies in Alberta are receiving significantly less, at 40$ now were aren’t cornered by the USA
4448 2018-05-29 17:21:03 When @nitin_gadkari said being in opposition was our job to oppose oil price hike then your journalist should have reminded him that now being in power it must be your duty to govern honestly.

4460 2018-05-29 17:19:58 The wise virgins aren’t selfish. This is illustrating the point that each person is responsible for themselves.

Why do you think the foolish virgins lack sufficient oil to last until He comes? Why do you think didn’t they bring extra flasks of oil?

4464 2018-05-29 17:19:42 a mildly sexist man asked why i don’t dress up more since i’m technically a receptionist and i was just like, “because there’s 40% chance i’m going to get grease or motor oil on me and i’m not about to stain my banana republic blouse” and wOW WAS IT SATISFYING
4465 2018-05-29 17:19:41 Of course not. I fly -- a lot in fact. That doesn't mean I can't oppose the expansion of oil production. It just means that have to acknowledge that jet fuel is too cheap given the environmental costs & that alternatives don't develop in an environment of cheap oil.
4466 2018-05-29 17:19:37 The relevance of that is what? The impetus for the tax-breaks came from Alberta - the Liberal MP in Alberta at the time, Anne McLellan, who convinced her cabinet colleagues that the oil sands needed help.

4474 2018-05-29 17:18:45 I don’t agree with his policies but this one gets Alberta oil to markets.
The USA is buying our glut of oil 25 a barrel less and selling it on world markets because we have no access. It’s a god thing for us Theo
4475 2018-05-29 17:18:43 But I dont think he actually traded it. Just said he hated it, he actually has to come out and say we'll never see Oil 7-handle again or something like that
4476 2018-05-29 17:18:43 @John_Andretti We are sorrowed to hear the latest news, We would like you to know we are praying for you. Please, please, check with your doctor about the highest dosage of CBD oil. Have friend who was stage 4 and still with us, 12 months into CBD treatment. Miracles can happen!
4477 2018-05-29 17:18:42 The next time this nigga comes out the shower dripping water on my floor tryna be some mf from an Old Spice commercial I'm putting oil on the floor.
4478 2018-05-29 17:18:41 Everyone seems to misunderstand that by "no one", I meant oil refineries.  Unless you own an Asian oil refinery who's choosing between cheap well oil and expensive-to-refine bitumen (oil sands), I wasn't talking about you.  Also, how did my tweet end up on top? Holy fuck go away.
4479 2018-05-29 17:18:41 But the best part is that he gets to tell Premier Jason Kenney: no oil for you in my pipeline without a carbon tax. And he gets that for free (not counting taxpayer dollars, of course). #kindersurprise
4480 2018-05-29 17:18:39 Is Venezuela the only place on earth that has oil. Anything reason to jack up gas prices.
4481 2018-05-29 17:18:30 When was the crude oil being sold at $120 per barrel?
4482 2018-05-29 17:18:24 Sure but in this case I expect due diligence this project is worth billions for $ and its oil
4483 2018-05-29 17:18:23 You know how sometimes when you get your oil changed, the shop recommends you fixing a different part?
I just went to my consultation to get my tonsils removed, and they said I have a deviated septum that should also get fixed. I love consultations.

4486 2018-05-29 17:18:08 Oil prices continue to edge lower on ramped up production fears. WTI oil at $67.11/barrel, -$0.77.
4487 2018-05-29 17:18:06 But with global warming issue and many uncertainties surrounding global oil market as well as fast depleting global oil reserves, onus is on us to seel alternative energy source and thereby save our planet.

4505 2018-05-29 17:17:08 Bitumen is mixed with many chemicals which all must be removed before it can be made into a salable product. Alberta will not get more for their product than they get relative to the world price of oil now & may get less because now Asia will have greater shipping costs.
4506 2018-05-29 17:17:00 In Canada, public money is available just in case an oil company building a pipeline gets skittish about having to actually pay for clean-up costs but not for improving living conditions on northern reserve lands. Please make a note. #kindermorganpipeline

4509 2018-05-29 17:16:48 #Lord, maybe when oil gets down to $30 and natural gas gets up to $6 those asinine "my shit don't stink" rich turnips will start running those super cargo ships on natural gas to get it up to $12 like they did running dirty oil an getting oil up to $120
Surely makes cents to me

4523 2018-05-29 17:15:29 Here’s all you need to know.  It’s safer to transport the oil.  But rips up the environment to build it.

Thank you Lord for the oil of the new this month of May. Indeed I look all around me and it's been newness galore. Behold, I am living breathing walking miracle.

4525 2018-05-29 17:15:14 I need an oil change
4526 2018-05-29 17:15:13 That's pretty much what I've been doing (but with peppermint oil instead of lemon juice). I think I might need a more strategic placement of Terro traps--those usually work, but there are just too many ants this year.
4527 2018-05-29 17:15:13 Oil
4528 2018-05-29 17:15:06 Just think if the baby oil 360 was included. Off the charts!!
4529 2018-05-29 17:15:04 Promising to raise taxes *on the rich* no doubt.

4531 2018-05-29 17:14:56 ETH is gas. Not a security. Sames as barrels of oil. It's a commodity.
4532 2018-05-29 17:14:50 Actually, I've heard it used many times to describe men.  First time I heard it used to describe a man was back in the 80's in the Alberta oil fields.
4533 2018-05-29 17:14:42 Next world war will not start because of water, not because of Oil but because of Auto Correct
4534 2018-05-29 17:14:37 Welcome to 21st century "journalism". And just think, they went to college for that.
4535 2018-05-29 17:14:33 How can one be certain that the CBD oil they are purchasing is top-quality, organic, etc?  What specifics should I look for?
4536 2018-05-29 17:14:33 The pipeline through BC and the coastal water shipping is the issue not the use of oil products, it is WHERE the pipeline goes that is the issue.
4537 2018-05-29 17:14:28 Pake kleveru yg rosehip seed oil coba
4538 2018-05-29 17:14:24 Just think that Scheer wont be getting those care checks from Koch bros any more for providing discounted oil to Houston refiners.
4539 2018-05-29 17:14:20 I can’t change your oil but once it’s fixed c’mon up to NY
4540 2018-05-29 17:14:07 two hours for oil???? insane
4541 2018-05-29 17:13:55 If you fry it, oil spread on the bread and fried makes it toasted, I was shocked when I discovered it but it's cool
4542 2018-05-29 17:13:55 No bs, just last week, I bought a jump rope, foam roller, weight lifting gloves, charcoal face mask, toner, moisturizer, beard oil, cologne & a polo shirt for less than $100. It’s the greatest place on earth

4544 2018-05-29 17:13:47 @vegsoc what do we do about hard vegetable fats containing palm oil?  ( That's ALL of them!) I can't buy any while orangutans are in danger.
4545 2018-05-29 17:13:46 Haha I kid you not my uncle used to own that company . Then he sold it. Lol. Not too long ago. Sufi oil lol.
4546 2018-05-29 17:13:44 Lol no, they won't. That money will be given to Kinder Morgan, they will build the pipeline, own it, operate it, and the only money the government will get back will be the taxes off the oil it moves.
4547 2018-05-29 17:13:44 @#SlashOilTax Mumbai, port city  with 2 oil company  HQ & 2 oil refineries pays highest rate for petrol & diesel. Daylight robbery by Central & state governments
4548 2018-05-29 17:13:38 My 2 year old niece just eats them out of the shell with a spoon and sometimes sesame oil
4549 2018-05-29 17:13:25 I know nothing about the oil industry or pipelines.  That said, sometimes a govt needs to step up to get a project going.  This doesn't seem nearly as outrageous as bailing out the automakers.  #ableg #cdnpoli
4550 2018-05-29 17:13:19 Pipeline yes, tankers no. But as you say, that was always the case. The pipeline owner is no longer responsible and liable for a spill once the oil is loaded on to a tanker at the Westridge tanker terminal.
4551 2018-05-29 17:13:17 Not particularly. There's some salt in the grated sirene cheese, but otherwise, there's no salt. Bulgarian restaurants provide  patrons with oil, vinegar, salt and pepper to sprinkle their own dressing of their own choice. I never add salt.

4554 2018-05-29 17:13:03 Bush is an idiot. But he also pulled off a massive terrorist attack involving thousands of people and no one has slipped in 17 years. For more oil.
4555 2018-05-29 17:12:57 Sorry Austrian lol the food I stan for is called achu. It's made from pounded coco yams and a palm oil soup.
4556 2018-05-29 17:12:52 I never knew how important sesame oil would become to my kitchen before watching @maangchi and following her recipes :') My kids also ADORE her. If y'all want some amazing Korean food, I highly recommend her YouTube channel ♡
4557 2018-05-29 17:12:45 Real guys don't use soaps like detol, protect, lux etc when they bath.
They use the diesel, Jik, used oil and the petrol. Especially the 93 on petrol.
4558 2018-05-29 17:12:42 Since when does Walmart do oil changes
4559 2018-05-29 17:12:41 Everyone in Alaska paid their college tuition by working in oil during the summer and they talk about it like they did a tour of duty in Cambodia
4560 2018-05-29 17:12:39 At least the conservatives told you what you would get for who you chose, seriously though Alberta should cut off all oil flow to B.C. if your province is foolish enough to think it can survive without it. Cheers!
4561 2018-05-29 17:12:38 "snake oil" 
4562 2018-05-29 17:12:31 So we now have the most incompetent government in the history of Canada controlling Alberta's oil even further.  Nothing bad can come of this.  #libtards #TrudeauMustGo
4563 2018-05-29 17:12:28 i could’ve changed your oil for free
4564 2018-05-29 17:12:27 Fake hike in prices. We are producing more oil and gas than anyone in the world now. Nothing more than a scam to hurt middle class Americans!
4565 2018-05-29 17:12:23 I'm glad the Texans are not going to harvest the profits when Canadian oil is moving.

Canada has decades worth of oil to export and the pay off from today's action will last generations if the Feds actually keep the pipeline.
4566 2018-05-29 17:12:22 Why are they in effect trying to forbid us from eating donuts..we've eaten them forever. Why isn't the UN banning the harvest of Palm oil???
UN = useless neuters
4567 2018-05-29 17:12:21 Watching musk drag the jurnos is the best thing I've seen in months
4568 2018-05-29 17:12:16 It’s child abuse, forcing your son to be a creepy beta.
4569 2018-05-29 17:12:13 The pipeline needs to be built so Alberta oil can not be sold at such a discount.
4570 2018-05-29 17:12:05 i'm not trying to be clever, but i actually don't understand at all why the government is buying the transmountain pipeline.  like, are they buying it for kinder morgan to use?  don't they have their own $$$?  is the gov't taking over oil/gas transportation? mommy is confusion
4571 2018-05-29 17:11:58 It is normal over time, if not used on a regular basis that some oil can settle and separate causing it to leak out. Unless the mixer has lost a fairly large amount of oil (¼ cup or more) this is most likely not a concern.
4572 2018-05-29 17:11:53 The guys at @MINIofSTL are becoming my buds. I stop in once a month to check my oil because I can’t see the indicator on the dip-stick.  They’re patient with me.  
4573 2018-05-29 17:11:49 After this first year of rigorous creativity and state investments, substantial part of all revenue from Oil must be channelled towards the most critical sectors - power, healthcare and education. 
Sacrifice must be made, we need a Defribulator to jumpstart naija soul
4574 2018-05-29 17:11:41 Putting this oil on my scalp is a breathe of fresh air rn 
4575 2018-05-29 17:11:38 I always used coconut oil for my hair treatments. NO. They key is OLIVE OIL. I did one last night for the first time and my hair has never felt healthier!
4576 2018-05-29 17:11:36 The nationalization of the Trans Mountain energy project creates shades of the nationalization elements of former PM Pierre Trudeau’s National Energy Programme. The NEP, as that policy was known, failed spectacularly when world oil prices declined. Trudeau thought they’d rise.
4577 2018-05-29 17:11:33 @CBCNews Re:Pipeline BC & Alberta are likened to neighbours in a duplex. One is a B&B, other does car repair. Cars are transported thru the B&B to get to the customers. Keep the oil off the carpet. Be ready to clean it up if there’s a spill
4578 2018-05-29 17:11:32 Nope, just watching gas prices go up every Memorial Weekend for the week. I'm tired of their greed.  And you, @CorruptionJones  are you the bot out to protect the greedy oil companies? Sure seem like you might be.
4579 2018-05-29 17:11:22 Let me get this straight: #KinderMorgan wants to build & pay for pipeline. #AB wants pipeline #BC protests the pipeline but wants the oil. A #wine war ensues between AB & BC. #Trudeau useless in negotiations. Buys pipeline! Costs all  billions! #youcantmakethisstuffup
4580 2018-05-29 17:11:20 You mean to say big oil bought the Trudeau government

4582 2018-05-29 17:11:12 SALAFIST MOSQUES IN THE UK. We pander to the Saudis and allow them to fund these because we want their money for BAE etc. They meantime want to extend their influence before the oil runs out. It's a dangerous deal though, radical Islam is being encouraged across Europe. #Liberty

4585 2018-05-29 17:11:03 Another Lie From You Sir, in 2016 the lowest  it came was $37 and it kept coming up from that point, if you want to justify why @mbuhari borrow so much because of that single month of oil price low then think again sir.
4586 2018-05-29 17:10:58 It appears that Italy's debt problems will be contagious in the US equity and oil markets, bad for corn, bean and wheat demand.....
4587 2018-05-29 17:10:56 July 15, 2005: 210,000 litres (1,320 barrels) of crude oil were leaked at the Sumas Tank Farm operated by Kinder Morgan (BC Metis Kinder Morgan Assessment, p. 4).

4591 2018-05-29 17:10:48 Second, if oil rips higher later this year that will widen BEI and likely weigh on real yields a bit
4592 2018-05-29 17:10:46 As happens in life, within 24 hours of our identifying the 3 pillars of supply-side price support for oil, the first pillar, OPEC/Russia production cuts, appeared to show cracks last Friday, with reports of Russia/Saudi deal to increase production: Brent dropped 3% and WTI 4%.

4597 2018-05-29 17:10:29 Well there are a lot of terpenes in cannabis but you would be marked incorrect in a pharmacology exam if you classified cannabis as an "essential oil". Good effort though, anonymous little pharma troll.

4600 2018-05-29 17:10:14 wow...now taxpayers will have to pay for the pipeline, and if any environmental spill should happen.  risk is > any reward. by the time it gets being built watch technolgy reduce the demand for oil even more.
4601 2018-05-29 17:10:13 As far as I know, in earlier times, elderflowers (or elder berries, or their oil) would have been used mostly medicinally. Not sure about food, though I think the flowers or berries might have been used to flavor beer.

4604 2018-05-29 17:09:59 Fried and seasoned aren't good because oil is a reflux irritant but plain potatoes have a low acidity and absorbent qualities so they kind of calm down the tummy.

4611 2018-05-29 17:09:10 Have you tried CBD oil? The lady at the health food store tried to talk me into it but I didn’t want to spend the money if it doesn’t really help.
4612 2018-05-29 17:08:50 January 24, 2012: An estimated 110,000 litres (692 barrels) of crude oil leaked from Kinder Morgan’s oil storage facility on Sumas Mountain in Abbotsford (BC Metis Kinder Morgan Assessment, p. 4).
4613 2018-05-29 17:08:47 Seriously.
4614 2018-05-29 17:08:45 I don't think any oil pipeline can be built by any party, corporation, federal or provincial government or individual. It is not unforced error. Had it been the Harper government that tried it, I suspect the line would be blocked in court or by people. It still will even now.
4615 2018-05-29 17:08:43 You realized we just nationalized the trans mountain pipeline project today, right Dan? That’s $7B for oil sands expansion. Funny time to be praising our climate action...
4616 2018-05-29 17:08:39 See @juliannejtaylor article on increased seed oil consumption
4617 2018-05-29 17:08:36 When the oil doesn't flow maybe they will try to turn the pipeline into affordable housing?
4618 2018-05-29 17:08:35 Need to go get an oil change 
4619 2018-05-29 17:08:33 May 6, 2009: An estimated 200,000 litres (1,260 barrels) of crude oil leaked from Kinder Morgan’s oil storage facility in Burnaby, BC (CBC).
4620 2018-05-29 17:08:15 July 24, 2007: 250,000 litres (1,500 barrels) of crude oil spilled out of the pipeline in Burnaby, BC. The crude oil flowed through neighbourhood storm sewers and ditches before entering and contaminating a large portion of Burrard Inlet (CBC).
4621 2018-05-29 17:08:09 I would still get a spider might spray and do it once every 2 to 3 days. I think they hatch daily so to truly get rid of them this must be done AT LEAST 4 times. Then get neam oil soap and water and spray weekly for preventative care.
4622 2018-05-29 17:08:03 Or oil by train like Lac Megantic!!!
4623 2018-05-29 17:08:01 Oh good; all Canadian taxpayers became oil barons this morning. $4.5 billion it cost us. Boy howdy, Im sure glad there was a vote on it. #kindermorganpipeline
4624 2018-05-29 17:08:00 Well unfortunately I won't be re-turning, the pizzas have a lovely amount of oil as they are, any more will ruin it.
4625 2018-05-29 17:07:59 June 4, 2007: 69,950 litres (440 barrels) of crude oil were spilled at former Wahleach pump station, and reports indicate that the Kinder Morgan pipeline may have been leaking for weeks beforehand (BC Metis Kinder Morgan Assessment, p. 4).

4632 2018-05-29 17:07:22 I love coconut oil. Thanks!
4633 2018-05-29 17:07:04 You are not understanding that oil needs to be transitioned if you want a livable planet. So you think that the price of oil is going to stay high enough to pay this off in 40 years? Not likely and now we get to pay for clean up of the spills, that can't be cleaned.
4634 2018-05-29 17:07:02 It also shows that private companies are bailing on the oil industry. They know it is not a viable long term investment. Too bad our federal government doesn’t realize or is scared to admit this. @JustinTrudeau @joycemurray
4635 2018-05-29 17:06:59 If oil price sinks and interest rates increases, fracking companies will go bankrupt soon.

4643 2018-05-29 17:06:08 Well to moisturize I use mainly olive and coconut oil but it’s not so much so what oils you’re using to moisturize but the steps. Gotta make sure your hair is damp prior to the process.
4644 2018-05-29 17:05:58 Does anyone else remember the windfall savings when Harper reduced the GST on gas?  No?  That's because the oil companies jacked their prices up on the same day!  The province will lose billions and the cartel will reap it all.

4646 2018-05-29 17:05:33 I thought Seattle giving the Mariners $200 million to build a pub and box seats was a horrid idea, but then I wake up to news that @JustinTrudeau is throwing over FOUR BILLION DOLLARS at an oil pipeline that will never pay for itself. Not even a loan.

The ruling class is so smrt
4647 2018-05-29 17:05:30 These ecoactivists hypocrites profit amply in their living standards fromoil! They use         &  equipments made from petrochemicals products! Also Newfoundland lives   to sea based oil fields! Sold&wind solution +expensive vs hydro power!
4648 2018-05-29 17:05:24 Of course it's coming from taxpayers because oil companies and financiers are bailing on the tarsands in droves. Some might come back as long as governments keep promising to back them up with no downside risk. More corporate welfare.
4649 2018-05-29 17:05:21 Ok, most of the people who own media outlets also own in whole or part large corporations that control resources. Most of these generate billions of $ a year in income and yes most of them are based on gas and oil. So renewable energy is a threat to the 'oil barons'.
4650 2018-05-29 17:05:20 You must have high pump taxes in MI. That's what usually drives up the price. That and now with us past Memorial Day the oil companies love jacking up the costs.

$65 a barrel , equates to $1.30-$1.50 a litre at the pumps??

A couple short years ago, it had to be over $110 a barrel to see those pump prices.  Little people get raped at pumps by politicians and oil tycoons.  Sad.
4655 2018-05-29 17:05:02 great you prediction about stock market raise may be related the oil prices going down

4658 2018-05-29 17:04:42 Premier @jjhorgan says federal decision to buy Kinder Morgan does not change BC's reference case b/c "case did not speak to a specific project." Says It spoke to transportation of oil and bitumen through BC in general

4663 2018-05-29 17:04:24 Now you @narendramodi @PMOIndia can Reduce the Oil Prices. As World Market Oil  reduced by 5$.
4664 2018-05-29 17:04:14 Also restaurants with deep fryers - be wary as the oil is often used for multiple items (only chips are fried separate - batter mushrooms etc would be fried in the same oil as other items)

4667 2018-05-29 17:04:05 Despite #climatechange, #Indigenous opposition, a stated commitment by  gov't to #UNDRIP and the environment, and the beginning of mass move away from oil to renewables, did the Trudeau government let #KinderMorgan plans to twin #TransMountain die? Nope. They bought it.
4668 2018-05-29 17:04:01 Call me crazy but I trust a Canadian government agency more than a bunch of multinational oil companies to phase us out of the fossil fuel game.

4677 2018-05-29 17:03:26 @RatoBaby_ Oil heaters don't warm up a place. A gas heater is a better option. Quite safe in my opinion. You can try an electric heater (Halogen heaters) ask for one that switches off when it trips.
4678 2018-05-29 17:02:53 Putin was going broke after Obama policies made us energy independent and exporters besides. OPEC was hurting too. Ask yourself why Don the Con is destabilizing oil markets.  He’s being paid, and our competitors know he’s an easy mark.
4679 2018-05-29 17:02:52 Trump is the one who takes from his foundation. He had that tacky 6 ft. oil painting done of himself with money from his charity. Unfortunately, he is his charity.
4680 2018-05-29 17:02:51 Yes,let's thank the incompetent bunglers in the federal gov't for not having the balls to enforce the law. Let's just throw taxpayers money at it. Glass half full kind of premier we have here. One who hates oil as much as Trudeau,but trying to save her ass. It won't work!

4687 2018-05-29 17:02:12 Have you tried putting like coconut oil overtime?
4688 2018-05-29 17:02:01 There is a finite amount of oil in the ground. That market *will* disappear when it runs out, or even sooner when renewable sources become cheaper. The latter is already happening.
4689 2018-05-29 17:01:58 None to tidewater... oil was twice the price, and demand for DilBit was higher.

4703 2018-05-29 17:00:43 @jakejakeny That is a sign that Saudi Arabia may be opting for more production, rather than restricting output. Also, artificially high oil prices only help Iran and Russia, its enemies.

Those are some mighty expensive jobs to pollute and damage the climate. There is no way we will recoup, oil is dying as a fuel.

4720 2018-05-29 16:59:40 Tip from a rational eater: try keep yolk semi-cooked, but never do the same w/ egg whites (raw white prevents body from absorbing biotin). I scramble yolk and whites separately: whites first, and when done I add yolk and leave it creamy. Add olive oil and experience a masterpiece

4726 2018-05-29 16:58:55 Yes he did. It must have been Buhari  who made the federal government so broke it had to borrow to pay salaries in 2014 and early 2015. I guess he blew the crude pipelines with his poor grammar in 2016.  And then crashed crude oil prices with his ineptitude. And damaged Angola.

4730 2018-05-29 16:58:12 Governments aren't really concerned about making money. If they lose $, its only taxpayers cash.
Also, I find it quite ironic that Feds are introducing carbon taxes to discourage use of fossil fuels and then buying/building a pipeline with taxpayer $ to get more oil to market
4731 2018-05-29 16:58:08 Trudeau has continually shown his willingness to deceive Canadians. He promised no subsidies to the oil industry. He promised a new NEB review process. He promised reconciliation for indigenous peoples. All promises that were broken today. #cdnpoli #bcpoli #StopKM

4746 2018-05-29 16:56:35 The 70 years of loot in the name of subsidy, controlled pricing for poor by Congress has left the oil companies bloodied and in shambles. So now you and me pay the price.
4747 2018-05-29 16:56:26 IIRC the real issue was the UK's stake in Antarctica, which has the possibility of oil reserves. Curiously, the major profit came to squid fishing, mostly by the former imperial possessor, Spain. 
4748 2018-05-29 16:56:22 I wish people wouldn't lump us all into the 'BC' crazy nonsense (no offence to you, it's quite commonly done) - it's mostly gov't that allows this, - I'm all in favour of getting that pipeline, including Energy East & getting rid of foreign oil imports!

4770 2018-05-29 16:53:57 Interesting picture. We can just subsidize the too costly ones. There is no planet B. Plastic is Oil. We should have absolute zero oil production by 2100 no exceptions
4771 2018-05-29 16:53:50 Is that word "oil"? 
4772 2018-05-29 16:53:45 True but we need oil in the meantime.
4773 2018-05-29 16:53:44 How long will it take the government to make the billions of dollars back that is being wasted to build a pipeline that would have been built for no cost to taxpayers? "Don't worry about it, Alberta will pay that back in transfer payments when they can ship more oil" Fuck off

4791 2018-05-29 16:52:31 The oil will be reduced regardless of there being a pipeline in place.  Until they cap the production/growth of the industry then this and maybe other pipelines make sense.
4792 2018-05-29 16:52:25 J'aime une vidéo @YouTube : "My mom put oil on her bird feeder to keep squirrels from stealing the bird food and" à l'adresse
4793 2018-05-29 16:52:21 I'm out of heating oil but can't bring myself to order any just yet #sweltering
4794 2018-05-29 16:52:17 Huy nakakaantok hetong lemon grass oil na pinahid ko sa ulo ko. Tito starter pack sya. Goodnight! :)
4795 2018-05-29 16:52:16 What’s your opinion on olive oil (and salt) with bread
4796 2018-05-29 16:52:13 My intuition tells me, taxpayers will pay and still no pipeline will be built. Trudeau hates Alberta and wants to phase out oil what a better way to do it.
4797 2018-05-29 16:52:11 True enough and let's just KILL that pipe dream all together and land lock the oil. Sounds good!
4798 2018-05-29 16:52:07 What have they done with the capitalist outrageous incomes of the Venezuelan oil production during the last four years?
4799 2018-05-29 16:51:54 Her position is that she wants the pipeline to transport refined oil sands product instead of unrefined oil. The refined oil is a more valuable product and creates jobs in Alberta (in her opinion). E.g. a cake at the store sells for more than the flour.
4800 2018-05-29 16:51:52 Not sure what he has to do with it, sure he looks like Chuckie and he wasn't the greatest coach, and he's kind of annoying on ESPN but - oh, never mind...
4801 2018-05-29 16:51:51 I think we'd have to agree that no forecast can predict the price of Oil- without that there is little else. Personally I'm with you : i would vote yes to Independent Scotalnd
4802 2018-05-29 16:51:46 Scheers crying proves he wants Koch bros checques for steering discounted oil south rather than building our own export pipeline for the good of all Canadians to sell oil at world price.
4803 2018-05-29 16:51:43 Please, no jokes about how Hillary's daughter looks like Olive Oil.
4804 2018-05-29 16:51:39 If someone tried to randomly start rubbing my feet right now with oil, I wouldn’t stop them. Just sayin
4805 2018-05-29 16:51:37 Cold pressed castor oil and Shea butter has done wonders for my 4b/c hair Cantu and shea moisture does not. I never had enough moisture or manageability until I used the cold pressed castor oil. Coconut oil did nothing.
4806 2018-05-29 16:51:29 But okay if we own the pipeline does that mean we lease it back to KM for usage or what? Can we lease the pipeline to other oil/bitumen exporters, or are we locked in with KM? How do we make money off of this thing?
4807 2018-05-29 16:51:26 im frying chicken  pray i dont burn my house down
ive fried chicken before but like ya know… the oil HOT 
4808 2018-05-29 16:51:23 Could someone please explain to me the benefits of the Liberal government purchasing the Trans Mountain Kinder Morgan Pipeline?  I just can't wrap my head around it and I work in the oil and gas industry.  This decision, financially does not make any sense.
4809 2018-05-29 16:51:15 What do you use?  I'm all about coconut oil.
4810 2018-05-29 16:51:11 I use sesame oil mixed with a few drops of tea tree oil! Is that bad? Am I going to die
4811 2018-05-29 16:51:09 Don't worry Rachel..Trudeau will make all native groups a partner..protests will waine and the oil will flow.
4812 2018-05-29 16:51:09 Our Govt is more worried about a pipeline that doesn't ship our oil and a carbon tax that doesn't exist instead of working towards reconciliation or closing the education funding gap for 1st nations. #skpoli
4813 2018-05-29 16:51:05 My Mom Sent Me A Coupon For Her Oil Change...That $15 Off Dont Mean Shit When The Shit $133
4814 2018-05-29 16:50:40 You can't campaign on the left & win with the help of young voters and expect to repeat your success when you make decisions like this. No electoral reform, no children's commissioner, no justice for Indigenous kids, arms sales to SA, an unprecedented national investment in oil.
4815 2018-05-29 16:50:38 Been grocery shopping. Oil change up next.
4816 2018-05-29 16:50:35 100 liters ...... not exactly a biblical amount and as with all oil field operations, there was a spill plan and it was activated. 
BREAKING:  Dramatic over reaction.
4817 2018-05-29 16:50:34 Considering oil market and the national advantage, it benefits us to expand exports. At the same time, it's so necessary to widely concern public opinion and different provisions' interest.
4818 2018-05-29 16:50:16 Mmmmm motor oil
4819 2018-05-29 16:50:14 Gotta get an oil change today
4820 2018-05-29 16:50:14 Most of the oil will go to the US. Not one #TransMountain tanker went to Asia last year. Aframax tankers are too small, are 20% empty, and what's in them is 30% condensate- not DilBit product.
4821 2018-05-29 16:50:09 Everyone always quick to react and jump like boiling oil. If I get angry, Lord forgvies me. Sigh. (Fight at the office right now...)
4822 2018-05-29 16:50:08 Nathan - DO YOU or DON'T you support thye $40B LNG Shell Oil Project in your neck of the Woods? If you do you're a Hypocrite! If you don't your an NDP economist for sure! Answer the question so your community can see where you stand on Exporting Carbon Energy!
4823 2018-05-29 16:49:59 i didn't know baby oil gEL existed until the other day and it's uuhhhhhlifechanging
4824 2018-05-29 16:49:51 Huh? RT @CoochCakes: Thanks for asking. RT @RetiredFilth: How many times y’all reuse the oil to fry chicken?
4825 2018-05-29 16:49:49 Well they also think they're brave like firefighters so...
4826 2018-05-29 16:49:47 If we don't sell it Venezuela & Saudia Arabia  will continue to sell more. Why should Canada handcuff themselves & leave the market more open to corrupt countries to profit more. Our Gov should also be working to make Canada completely independent when it comes to oil & gas
4827 2018-05-29 16:49:41 Trudeau to FNs: sorry no more money for water or education or housing or health care

Trudeau to vets: sorry no more money for pain and suffering

Trudeau to US oil giant: well helllllllooooooooo here’s $4.5 billion for your discount sludge pipeline
4828 2018-05-29 16:49:37 He is corrupt like evrey1 else...
Look at the state of nigeria.. its a mess..  no jobs, all poverty..  even wit all that oil money..  how is Dubai better than nigeria and that is a pure Deseret???????

4829 2018-05-29 16:49:34 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
4830 2018-05-29 16:49:33 Rumusnya ya, apapun yang waterproof itu lawannya oil. Sunscreen bisa bersih juga pakai oil clenser. Tonton lagi deh videonya kak Affi.
4831 2018-05-29 16:49:32 @JustinTrudeau & now how many Reserves will be forced to live with toxic drinking water because rather than do right by these people...You see dropping 4.5 Billion on the oil industry a better choice?
You have shown by the right people Your government can be bought & paid for
4832 2018-05-29 16:49:30 This, the same democrat liar that was quoted as saying we're going to have 'brainwash' children against guns, bet he's having an orgasm over this #DavidHogg kid. #starbucks
4833 2018-05-29 16:49:30 It worked well. Depends on the oil you use. Also, those medicated shampoos are a blessing. I always used to go for the fancy ones jiska advertisements I saw on tv, but honestly they do no good. You can try shampoos from Himalaya, Ayush and conditioners from the fancier brands.
4834 2018-05-29 16:49:17 I am sure that dress is on backwards. Very disturbing message sorta tells everyone she and Jason have a similar economic oil resource plan for Albertans. Did anyone check Jasons feet are his shoes on backwards?

4837 2018-05-29 16:49:14 Some of us don't want oil spills in our rivers and don't need to be paid to believe that sentiment.
4838 2018-05-29 16:49:13 Also Castrol oil >>>>coconut oil
4839 2018-05-29 16:49:07 We just finished building the alternative energy lab @ red deer college. $5M on a 600sq facility that is striving to replace oil. It will take time. In the mean time let’s buy all the oil we need from Saudi and Venezuela. Billions of $$ to blood thirsty dictators.
4840 2018-05-29 16:49:05 Thanks for asking. RT @RetiredFilth: How many times y’all reuse the oil to fry chicken?

4842 2018-05-29 16:49:02 It makes me cringe everytime I see my mom reuse oil to fry something.

4845 2018-05-29 16:48:47 My dad lent me two of his most prized books and while in florida, suntan oil spilled in my bag and got all over them. So while they’re permanently stained, they do smell like glistening beach babes.
4846 2018-05-29 16:48:29 Oil
4847 2018-05-29 16:48:23 Very depressing. Our future (if we have one) is not in oil.
4848 2018-05-29 16:48:10 My face becomes an oil slick so while my current location isn't usually super hot and humid, my summer makeup becomes eyeshadow stick and mascara as opposed to full shadow and liner b/c sweat plus liner on my oily skin is a nightmare. I never use foundation so that isn't a factor
4849 2018-05-29 16:48:09 Elders grew pumpkin plants using  leaves for relish;  pulp for pudding, seeds for oil, shell as water/beverage container or making musical instruments. Their wisdom surpasses many who acquire academic certificates

4852 2018-05-29 16:47:40 The silver lining is that this is capitalism in action - J Crew knew that hipster wokies would want this, so they quickly produced it and sold it to them very efficiently (something govt could never do).  Free markets work even for these lunatics.
4853 2018-05-29 16:47:34 Your music remains real baba.... Oil de pour
4854 2018-05-29 16:47:34 et  l'augmentation du gaz de l'essence ,du gas oil c'est pisser dans un violon?
4855 2018-05-29 16:47:34 Approving the Keystone pipeline and opening up more federal lands to drilling helps every American as we become energy independent. This year we will be the biggest producer and exporter of oil in the world. That helps millions of Americans. Not just the rich that you hate.
4856 2018-05-29 16:47:27 Baby oil bisa
4857 2018-05-29 16:47:26 Gas prices are going up cause those of us in the oil field and refineries are going back to work and we get paid so gas prices going up is a good thing for us and the tax cuts can pay for gas unless your making minimum wage then its your fault for having a minimul job
4858 2018-05-29 16:47:22 "By the oil fields of agrabah" are you fucking kidding me??
4859 2018-05-29 16:47:19 Venezuela controls all of the oil and is running out of gasoline. This is not a good development.
4860 2018-05-29 16:47:16 Premier Rachel Notley says AB gov has no plans to invest in project but Alberta is putting up $2B towards indemnity pool.

"And that investment will be payable only once oil begins to flow through the pipeline"

She broke the code by making those ladies who posted their #nomakeuptwitter pics look ugly.

@muhd_badamasi10 took a bold step in letting her know that every girl is beautiful in her own way, and I supported him.

4873 2018-05-29 16:45:56 i kinda wanna get into soap making. gonna be hard to find all the right oils besides olive oil which we have plenty of tho
4874 2018-05-29 16:45:55 The job growth is in clean tech and renewables, surpassing oil and gas in 2012.
4875 2018-05-29 16:45:47 And can we also ask how we incured up to 10 trillion in debt before 2015 even with the huge oil revenue during those period, as we where told dat obj had paid almost all our debt by 2007
4876 2018-05-29 16:45:46 Palmer's coconut oil?
4877 2018-05-29 16:45:44 Ladies, imagine if we could get an oil change where we don’t get 12 other services offered because we know nothing about our cars
4878 2018-05-29 16:45:33 Maybe, because it looks similar to a Landy, it’s the only way they could prevent an oil leak

4881 2018-05-29 16:45:16 #LeapManifesto has more than #NDP adherents. Where is the sense in building a pipeline in BC to bring in foreign oil because Alberta pinches supply for blocking Kinder Morgan? Explain me
4882 2018-05-29 16:45:10 i know it's a gas. wanted you to go check how much is an oil heater.
4883 2018-05-29 16:45:10 I mix together different hair masque, and add oils to them such as castor oil which is good for thickening your hair and coconut oil which is good for fixing basically your life haha. I sell mine for $10 for 8 ounces if you ever wanna get any with any @SkyyBombs products.

4886 2018-05-29 16:45:02 We don't handle any crude oil.
4887 2018-05-29 16:45:01 I had an unexpected day off so for once in my life I was actually productive and got my car inspected and the oil changed this bitch is LEARNING

4894 2018-05-29 16:44:31 Disappointing. This issue deserved solid cost analysis instead of a limited fact-based political decision. Economics in global energy have changed dramatically in the past 4 years and now oil sands are sitting too high on the cost curve. Houston: Ottawa just solved your problem
4895 2018-05-29 16:44:30 I asked two men in my life to do the SIMPLEST things this week while I was on vacation. 6 days notice. I asked to:

A) get picked up from the airport, and
B) have my oil changed in my car (I would pay.)

Well wouldn’t you know it I took an Uber home and my oil’s not changed.
4896 2018-05-29 16:44:14 It's the open challenge by PM Modi Ji that if people will vote for other parties like in Karnataka, he will take immediate action by increasing prices of Petrol & Diesel even when crude oil price fell from $108/ barrel in 2014 to $75 in May 2018.

About 70% of olive oil being sold is not actually pure olive oil.

4901 2018-05-29 16:44:01 If you invested in oil, retail, gold or financial sectors, you would have made new post 08 lows within your 2010-15 timeframe.
4902 2018-05-29 16:43:59 So we have to hit thousand of millions of deaths before we take action? If we want to help prevent thousands of millions of deaths, let's expropriate oil producers and shut 'em down.
4903 2018-05-29 16:43:56 The con is I have to deal with people if the rim cleaner we have works on their car. He thought it was engine oil...
4904 2018-05-29 16:43:50 "If you're brown and pretty money comes easy but if you're ugly you have to burn the midnight oil". "From the looks of it you'll be scraping away alot of candle wax" I appreciated the tough love encouragement. I aspired to work for everything I wanted.
4905 2018-05-29 16:43:46 Yes coconut oil messed my face up! I tried it following these new naturalistas lol but na I been natural all these long and I been fine I’ll stick to what works for me and that’s my 2 products. My hair makes its own oil
4906 2018-05-29 16:43:44 Is it just the oil rich sea borders you would hope to keep? Or would you want to keep the not so well of areas of Scotland as well, should those specific areas vote for the union? #ItsAllAboutTheOil
4907 2018-05-29 16:43:41 Anthony don't be logical. Canadians and logic are like oil and water.
4908 2018-05-29 16:43:27 So then if I put Shea butter or coconut oil or curly custard in my hair (which changes, disturbs, and does not leave me as is ) by this man’s logic, I’m not natural 
4909 2018-05-29 16:43:21 The true power of a low carb diet is that by opting for low carb you have no space for more than 10% carb. dense products & that automatically throws way sugar, grains, seed oil, starches and  junk food. and hey presto you end up with hugely varied REAL FOOD diet
4910 2018-05-29 16:43:20 Dude I drive a car. Don’t be so small minded. Oil spills happen they are not listening to aboriginal communities. And yes when it comes to oil sands leave it in the ground. Bye.

4912 2018-05-29 16:43:10 I’m at a shop getting my inspection done and this lady next to me brought her car in for an oil. The guy from the shop came in and asked when the last oil change she got was… she said it’s been ONE YEAR 
4913 2018-05-29 16:43:09 Sir,I m blind follower of @narendramodi ji. But now I have dout on his minister-they may be active player in oil game.sir save govtt from your minister
4914 2018-05-29 16:42:52 Can you show proof that crude oil ever sold at $145 per barrel? So because Buhari lies, Lai lies and most politicians especially APC members lie, you think lying has become normal abi? No, fam. You can’t be lying shamelessly like this while defending incompetence. Rubbish

4923 2018-05-29 16:42:01 I get it that the people of Alberta need the energy industry to live, and I'm inclined to agree that they deserve to get their oil products to markets overseas, hence Alberta's support for the KM pipeline expansion.
4924 2018-05-29 16:41:50 #cdnpoli’s right wing: Buying the pipeline is wrong because it is socialism! Oil, but private oil! #cdnpoli’s left-wing: why spend public money for a Texas oil company when you could invest the same billions in people, green energy and other public services?

4926 2018-05-29 16:41:33 @aajtak shame on PM Modi who was so critical on petrol price rise in 2012, same person now defending the price rise to crude oil price. Was it not the same during 2012-13. #Nepal is importing and selling at lower price than us!! #why #lootmaarki Govt. Thanks @aajtak for taking up
4927 2018-05-29 16:41:32 मीडिया और भाजपा देश का दुश्मन बन गया है जी जब क्रूड oil usd 170 पर द्रोम था तब भी भारत में ये रेट नहीं हुआ जो भाजपा देश को लूट रही आज usd 60 per द्रोम है केयो देश को लूट रहा है मोदी और भाजपा@yadavakhilesh@sunilsingh @PramukhSunil @profamishra @MLArajeshSP @YadavsAniruddh @ndtv

4932 2018-05-29 16:41:12 You are correct. Trump's actions on #Iran hit at the very heart of national survival and well-being for #EuropeanUnion #EU & its #NATO members -- the price of oil. Of such things #GreatWars are made. And economies demolished. #TrumpRussiaConspiracy #TrumpPutin #IaGOP #IaDems
4933 2018-05-29 16:41:07 Life without "you baby" is like
Tabbouleh without parsley or Homous without olive oil  or Kebbeh without meat.

4934 2018-05-29 16:40:59 Potable water is the new Oil
4935 2018-05-29 16:40:58 And what makes it hazardous is mixing all those products together. I used coconut oil to repair my hair. It worked but did damage to my skin. I stopped using it and only use it when necessary. Water and some blue magic with suffice too lol
4936 2018-05-29 16:40:54 Is anyone surprised that Perdue Pharma concealed what they knew about OxyContin? Big Business = big money = we don’t care about human lives. Money above all! GREED will end the human race. And soon. Keep on poisoning air/water/soil Big Oil!
4937 2018-05-29 16:40:53 60 to 70% of the existing pipeline volume is consumed in British Columbia.  Some volume does go into Washington and California where there are refineries built to refine heavy oil and bitumen. Your source of information is incorrect.
4938 2018-05-29 16:40:52 @dpradhanbjp sir why you are sitting in your office, if you cant control the price of petrol & diesel .... You are giving excuse of international market.... But you forget sir.... #publicSabJaantiHai bring crude oil in #GST as 2019 is ahead in front of you ... Good Luck
4939 2018-05-29 16:40:51 Bot oil at 66 and spoos at 2680 don't @ me
4940 2018-05-29 16:40:50 Oh wow my lame oil painting got 170 instagram like. wig
4941 2018-05-29 16:40:47 wel Trudeau did it, completed his plan to nationalize our oil sector, mor govenrment control
4942 2018-05-29 16:40:45 ECUADOR OIL MINISTER SAYS #OPEC SHOULD MAINTAIN OUTPUT CUTS AT NEXT MEETING: RTRS. #OOTT
4943 2018-05-29 16:40:45 He lost oil pressure as well
4944 2018-05-29 16:40:43 "And rapper Common".
4945 2018-05-29 16:40:40 I'm voting in the advance polls today. After watching Trudeau waste 4.5k on a crude oil pipeline that can only get built thru violation of treaty rights, it's going to feel good seeing my local NDP candidate win in what's now a Liberal riding. #onpoli #cdnpoli #stopkm
4946 2018-05-29 16:40:40 Well Justin made it clear that he doesn't want the oil. I suppose they feel justified.
4947 2018-05-29 16:40:37 Well he’s likely gained more than he’s lost. Sorry but we are a blue collar city and many industries are tied to Oil. If supporting our industries would cost your vote, you should reevaluate what you want in a city mayor.
4948 2018-05-29 16:40:29 อยากรู้ว่าคนที่แต่งดิสแบบใส่oil paint smart sharpen smart blurและอื่นๆไรนี่คนแรกคือใครอ่ะ คือมันสุดล้ำมาก งง
4949 2018-05-29 16:40:29 Ontario Hydro sale had nothing to do with oil or renewable energy
4950 2018-05-29 16:40:29 But of course. The heat has expanded/deformed rails. Humza must resign. It’s like a) oil price low - Scotland shite; b) oil price high - Scotland still shite
4951 2018-05-29 16:40:28 ＢＢひでえよ…(泣
4952 2018-05-29 16:40:26 When the economy collapses because of unfunded pensions and infrastructure, when our pesticide, monoculture and antibiotic heavy agriculture bites us on the ass, when the oil runs out, then we'll learn our limits once again
4953 2018-05-29 16:40:23 Avocado oil?
4954 2018-05-29 16:40:22 As you know. This oil is to be loaded on ship, sent to China. In return we get a 2 year contract at cheap prices with China with no assurance of extension.
4955 2018-05-29 16:40:21 You can’t compare tomatoes to oil though
4956 2018-05-29 16:40:15 no, i put little by little. i put the gel then brush and keep brushing until it’s slick then add a bit more if needed. but after you tie it down and it’s slick, put the oil last minute so it doesn’t mess with the slickness
4957 2018-05-29 16:40:11 サラダ油に流されて変わってゆく私をあなたは時々遠くで叱って。
4958 2018-05-29 16:39:54 I’m all for decreasing fossil fuels, which is why the government should stay out of the oil biz. There may be an analogy to be made at some point in the coming decades with regards to climate change & war, but with war you get thousands/millions of deaths. Does that happen here?
4959 2018-05-29 16:39:51 Been using the Tea Tree Oil I use to give me hair that poof lol
4960 2018-05-29 16:39:44 Honorable Sir, Infrastructure related tangible performances are silence in the list of our achievements in last 4 years (e.g: Niser of Bhubaneswar, Indian oil refinery at Paradeep) @narendramodi
4961 2018-05-29 16:39:43 It's fish oil NOT cooking oil
4962 2018-05-29 16:39:42 They'll never,especially Kano Barber's, even carving they must spoil,no matter hw u explain
4963 2018-05-29 16:39:41 I'm no fan of Kinder Morgan in any way, nor am I a fan of pipelines that carry crude oil through environmentally-sensitive areas, plus I'd like to see what exactly do it is meant that the pipeline project went through rigorous environmental reviews.
4964 2018-05-29 16:39:41 For the Deltas if you come to my yard and throw hooks when you stroll, you not getting a bite of this chicken or a drop of this oil

-find a a skincare routine
-change your pillow case every week.
-DON’T pick your skin or pop spots.
-use caster oil to make your eyebrows/eyelashes grow.
4970 2018-05-29 16:39:03 2013-2014 mein crude oil ka price 140 dollar plus tha, fir modi ji ki kismat se 30 dollar ho Gaya, ab 80 dollar hai per price wohi hai India mein 2013 mein tha. Ye Bata ki Karnataka election mein 19 din Kyun nahi rate badha fir?
4971 2018-05-29 16:39:03 Jah will oil our hearts to forgive them
4972 2018-05-29 16:39:03 Republicans (Mormons) in Utah made a deal with the devil so they could get the coal/oil lands out of federal control.  

They kissed the ring.  Yep.

Mitt is old school Republican, but not one with a spine.

• Skincare Routine day and night
• Avoid sugary foods and drinks
• Don’t touch face (IG: @xselfcarebb)
• Drink some green tea
• Clean Phone
• Use Tea tree oil as a spot treatment for any spots
4975 2018-05-29 16:38:37 Our pure focus on green energy, our carbon tax proposals, they are half thought out measures contrary to developing our oil industry.
4976 2018-05-29 16:38:17 You should do a bit of research. Chinese companies have partnered with TransCanada Pipelines on some major projects, including the pipeline from Ft Mac to Bruderheim, which was to be first leg of Gateway Pipeline. Makes sense. They own big chunk of oil sands
4977 2018-05-29 16:38:15 Try DBC and THC oil that you get from marijuana plant, and there is serious medical records that lower Cancer from several countries! I have also suggested to inject havy salt water mix into tumors that not destroy other organs. Check with different doctors! Sending prayers.
4978 2018-05-29 16:38:13 If someone made a 20 minute sitcom about weird stuff that happens to me on a daily basis, it would win an award i swear. I’m at the car dealer waiting for an oil change and this white guy with a fu manchu is teaching his toddler every swear word in the book. What is life?
4979 2018-05-29 16:38:09 Scary times we’re living in today. Biggest problem is that we depend too much upon oil from Saudi Arabia. They’re the ones providing $ for mosques expansion, invasion through immigration, why else have they not taken in refugees?they’re rich from oil.
4980 2018-05-29 16:38:08 mccain is one of the few good republicans.  most bought- more pollution, more expensive healthcare, no renewable energy( bought by coal and oil,  ripping babies from their parents
4981 2018-05-29 16:38:00 Have I got the body oil for you!
4982 2018-05-29 16:37:57 Like an oil tanker tipped at sea, this love's contaminated me.
4983 2018-05-29 16:37:43 really? it never flakes on me. i don’t put too much either but if it flakes, put some oil on it.
4984 2018-05-29 16:37:43 No one even eats the bread that’s used as a base lol It gets soggy from the oil & heat of the meat
4985 2018-05-29 16:37:38 I just read government to buy Trans mountain oil lines.  That’s what the delay was all about.  I think it’s awful. The government will control the pool now. Pls Scheer try and stall this so it doesn’t pass.
4986 2018-05-29 16:37:38 What does this have to do with oil?
4987 2018-05-29 16:37:35 Funny the photo is of floating oil don’t they know bunker c sinks....
4988 2018-05-29 16:37:32 @BillOReilly  can you get involved in the illegal claims being made about health regarding Omega 3 Fish Oil Products? No one has been brave enough to expose this DHA EPA fraud.
4989 2018-05-29 16:37:28 Oil market correction continues Tuesday. OPIS shows spot gasoline prices down 2.4cts gal LA; 4.4cts SF; 5cts Pacific Northwest; and 4-5cts gal East of the Rockies. As spring corrections go, a 6% drop is not impressive.
4990 2018-05-29 16:37:27 Would you call this an oil subsidy?
4991 2018-05-29 16:37:23 You have to give it at least a month. Also consider some oil to make sure the skin stays good to avoid beard itch.
4992 2018-05-29 16:37:21 I turned into a body oil crackhead
4993 2018-05-29 16:37:20 @LeevyLin Oil King is so cute
4994 2018-05-29 16:37:15 They now completely control access to tide water there by ownership of western oil resources
4995 2018-05-29 16:37:06 Why the TSX isn’t blowing up given plunging oil prices, creeping bond yields and capital outflows is beyond me. LeBron would be proud
4996 2018-05-29 16:37:04 Rails are not the safest way to transport oil. This has been demonstrated time and time again.
4997 2018-05-29 16:37:04 @NewsTalk770 @ABDanielleSmith Mark my words Danielle, taxpayers will have spent $10Billion before first oil flows in this pipeline.

5000 2018-05-29 16:36:36 Given the rising gas prices, it looks like the oil companies were not satisfied with the gifts given to them by the EPA and the tax bill. They are going to get your tax cut money as well.
5001 2018-05-29 16:36:33 I just wanna know why the hell its so expensive to change some damn oil. Really wishing out mechanic didn’t retire 
5002 2018-05-29 16:36:30 You guys it‘s soo hot, my coconut oil melted into a literal oil
5003 2018-05-29 16:36:26 How big a kickback is the oil industry going to line your pockets with?
How many Reserves across this country Still have toxic & undrinkable water yet you  drop 4.5 Billion like it's a nickle for the oil industry?
We will remember you when the first spill kills entire ecosystems
5004 2018-05-29 16:36:18 If it's powered by gas/oil. RETHINK IT.
5005 2018-05-29 16:36:15 Oh yeah, turning a Starbucks employee enforcing company policy into a racial firestorm in order to get Obama allies paid is totally all about helping calm racism in Trump's America. Got it. Nailed it.
5006 2018-05-29 16:36:14 It means a Trudeau is in the process of nationalizing the transportation of our natural resources. His father did it in 1975 to the oil and gas business by starting Petrocanada.
5007 2018-05-29 16:36:14 Stream is going to be later tonight around 9:00 or 9:30 as the mirror mode tournament races on the SEGA Genesis Classic doesn't start until 10pm. 

We'll be racing Ristar (Complete Stage 3) Streets of Rage 2 (Complete Stage 4) and Sonic 2 (Complete Oil Ocean) back to back.
5008 2018-05-29 16:36:13 NO. Let the pipeline and oil sands die. Our planet  depends on it. No lawn sign or vote next time for @jimcarr_wpg. Hypocrites.

5010 2018-05-29 16:36:07 Before they go blaming again; Oil is now $80 per barrel
At $65 Jonathan was selling fuel at N87 per litre
Just so you know...!
5011 2018-05-29 16:36:03 Under Obama:
Uninsured: down 15.2 million. Oil production: up 77%. Wind and solar: up 369%. Jobs: 11 641 000 created. Violent crime: down 16%. Under Trump’s plan despite the booming economy that Obama gave him, the debt is projected to rise to 29 trillion by 2028.
5012 2018-05-29 16:36:00 I think it has to be reconceptuallized. I think it should be packaged as part of the Global Warming initiative. I know, Smart Oil Transporter with William Shatner as a spokesperson, going boldly where interprovincial relations have never gone.

5015 2018-05-29 16:35:52 I don,t think this pipeline needs to be built,the Asian requirement for Alberta oil is way overstated,oil is already being sold at $23.00 below cost.I feel we are wasteful in our consumption of petroleum products and therefore a little conservation on our parts would be helpfull
5016 2018-05-29 16:35:50 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.

5027 2018-05-29 16:35:23 The #BillMorneau federal LIBERALS Corporate Road Show just bought a 65yr old aging pipeline, that leaks like a sieve and only earned $340M in the past 3 yrs, for $4.5B of Cdn taxpayer's money from a foreign oil co. It's called a #BAILOUT #cdnpoli #bcpoli #ableg #onpoli
5028 2018-05-29 16:35:20 If  Kinder Morgan pipeline expansion goes through, company plans to invest $100 million in marine oil spill response plans, which include opening five new bases in B.C., 100 new staff and cutting spill response times in half.
 Will the gov now be responsible for these..?
5029 2018-05-29 16:35:18 @jonmccomb980 I  how we bought km pipeline. In an age when a bunch of utilities were privatised by neoliberals like Christy Clark and Gordon Campbell (bcrail, bctel, etc...) the feds managed to hustle an oil company thnx to political turmoil. GANGSTA

5031 2018-05-29 16:35:08 Hey it’s a start, great job! How did you cook the veggies? I usually cut up everything green to bite sized pieces, toss with oil and S&P and roast at 450 for 35 mins, tossing occasionally. You can also make kale chips in the oven
5032 2018-05-29 16:35:04 Speciality oil....they throw it around like we do lard in italy#TheChase
5033 2018-05-29 16:34:59 if I was PM BC wouldn't have enough oil to put on a squeaky door. They can ride horses they're familiar with the backalready.
5034 2018-05-29 16:34:59 How many years of oil is left...can they make an electric jets...lol.
5035 2018-05-29 16:34:34 I was more referring to oil spiking during the burgeoning subprime crisis bc of the mkt’s obliviousness to a potential demand destruction from the fallout. I see lumber w similar characteristics

5038 2018-05-29 16:34:16 i’ll bring tanning oil with me
5039 2018-05-29 16:34:12 keep in mind folks that there is Oil being shipped down that pipeline. This pipeline is making money as we speak.
5040 2018-05-29 16:34:12 Would definitely say use soap bars but make sure they have plastic free packaging, natural and have no palm oil or sls in them.
5041 2018-05-29 16:34:05 Let's revisit their performance of 5 years:

1_BRT.

4-Peshawar Heritage Trail.
5_Karak oil refinery (project in pipeline).
6_Reforms in health sector
7_Reforms in Police
8_Reforms in education sector
9_ten(10) new universities
5042 2018-05-29 16:34:01 Europe is divided, to stand with US. Japan are in wrong foot, its better to satisfy as trading nation. And in other hand Russia policy depends on Oil Price, higher the price more independent otherwise looking for allies. Iran and China are for long haul.
5043 2018-05-29 16:33:58 I need a car that take regular oil bro this junk cost waaaaaay too much
5044 2018-05-29 16:33:57 Sweet sweet irony.
5045 2018-05-29 16:33:56 4.5 Billion for Oil?? 
Yet how many Reserves STILL do not have ADEQUATE DRINKING WATER?
This is beyond disgusting!!
 This proves to every Canadian Your government  can be bought & paid for by the right special interest groups.
#SellOut #LiberalPartyBoughtandPaidFor
5046 2018-05-29 16:33:52 Yup, the dilbit that will travel by ship. I forget where I heard, but growing demand for that stuff. Canada is in a position to show leadership and flex it's engineering prowess. Not ideal, but I think it is safer than by train or rail. Yes, Asia processing heavy oil products.
5047 2018-05-29 16:33:38 they didnt resolve one issue they just pushed it through so they could get rich they say that they need this pipeline to keep revenue from discount oil from going to USA now USA will make 200 mil a day off of canadas oil instead of 100 mill a day NOT ONE DIME WILL STAY IN CANADA
5048 2018-05-29 16:33:29 Spilled hot oil onto my trainers, it went straight through and was badly burning my toes but it was in the middle of lunch rush so I just kicked the fridge and let the oil cook my piggies. If that isn’t a metaphor for the last two years at my job idk what is
5049 2018-05-29 16:33:28 LAMP OIL! FUCKING LAMP OIL LIKE WTF
5050 2018-05-29 16:33:12 işte aradığım gamsızlık level’ı ve bunun fuel oil’i halhal 
5051 2018-05-29 16:33:10 @dpradhanbjp @PMOIndia @arunjaitley  Crude oil prices are down almost 6% . INR is also strengthening 1.5% . Why you people are not taking necessary action. are you lost of your mind. we are supporting you in any condition but this is unacceptable.
5052 2018-05-29 16:33:07 Notley dishonest! Increasing pollution from oil production while pretending she cares about climate change!  Disgusting!
5053 2018-05-29 16:33:02 It's failing and oil is going to be/should be a thing of the past.  We will not get our money back plus it's yet another example of corporate welfare at our expense, plus ignoring the future, plus ignoring the people, plus, plus... freaking bonkers.
5054 2018-05-29 16:32:57 @KitsMits Sounds delicious! May we suggest our Olive Oil Cake for the next date night?
5055 2018-05-29 16:32:54 Lebih enak, taruh dua kotak butter + olive oil, setelah melt, masukin garlic digeprek + daging + herbs setelah itu kuahnya itu disiram ke dagingnya
5056 2018-05-29 16:32:34 Soy sauce and sesame oil always dies the trick.
5057 2018-05-29 16:32:34 U.S. is a war state we bomb countries for oil, big banks, & the dollar. Government doesn't care about the citizens except the wealthiest 1%.

5059 2018-05-29 16:32:26 The fact that 'Crudeau' plans on selling pipeline after it's built (with MONSTER cost overrun$, we can be sure), means that  will, of course, out bid anyone else, & the pipe, together with their Tar Sands holdings, will make  essentially *owners of the  oil industry*!
5060 2018-05-29 16:32:25 surely there's at least one canadian crooked evil oil man that we can throw money at to ruin our lives?
5061 2018-05-29 16:32:23 It's a total racket, but, at least only the left is being victimized here ( I do realize there are people with other political ideologies who work at the stores, and I pity them).
5062 2018-05-29 16:32:13 Not a lot of oil workers in Manitoba. And the proper term is "fat ass".
5063 2018-05-29 16:32:10 Dr tiff body. Isinya sih cm gula yg di mix sm coconut oil gt. Jd ngegumpal dan stlh ngescrub jd lebih lembut. Gak kasar ataupun sampe lecet dan berdarah.
5064 2018-05-29 16:32:01 they didnt resolve one issue they just pushed it through so they could get rich they say that they need this pipeline to keep revenue from discount oil from going to USA now USA will make 200 mil a day off of canadas oil instead of 100 mill a day NOT ONE DIME WILL STAY IN CANADA

5068 2018-05-29 16:31:47 The trailer of the truck is actually called a tank. It could be a water hauling tanker, a milk hauling tanker, oil hauling tanker, etc.

Water hauling tanks hold approx. 130 BBL of liquid. Those guys almost got a citation for being over in weight... 
5069 2018-05-29 16:31:44 I think it's very different than the auto bailout in a number of ways incl it being tied up in court challenges, and of course the environmental/climate change implications of boosting the oil sector

5071 2018-05-29 16:31:38 russia desperately needs higher oil prices.

SA (who always wants higher oil prices) now has "excuse" to get nuclear weapons

Netanyahu is in political hotwater and needs an "outside" threat to deflect.

russia, SA, israel ... trump is just a puppet taking orders.
5072 2018-05-29 16:31:35 I’m sure they put the oil in a pipeline and don’t float it down the river.
5073 2018-05-29 16:31:34 Dear Kinder Morgan,

I sincerely hope you just cancel the TransMountain, instead of selling to the federal government. 

Sincerely,
An Albertan Oil & Gas Worker
5074 2018-05-29 16:31:34 Under the conservation they were still public land tombe used by the public.  Under Trump it will be sold off to his cronies and made.private land for oil or coal.
5075 2018-05-29 16:31:30 Exactly. There are more efficient ways to get oil to market. I predict this route and method will operate at a loss. All this environmental risk for what?
5076 2018-05-29 16:31:30 AMEN. We can drill our own oil, mine our own coal, build our own power plants!
5077 2018-05-29 16:31:28 In d 2016 bugeted oil bench mark was set at 38 dollar and actual oil price fail to as low as even 27 dollar in january of 2016 and started almost below the oil bench mark in 2016,so my question is if u where d govt wat would u have done did u expect them to have increase tax or ?
5078 2018-05-29 16:31:22 I'm just calling your comment that compares Canada to Venezuela, it's not even close and will never be. Venezuela has had issues way back that had nothing to do with nationalize oil. Look up the history going back to 80s and 90s
5079 2018-05-29 16:31:14 Okay so what about when the USA dropped the A bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki? And when the USA cut off the oil to Japan forcing the attack on Pearl Harbour?
5080 2018-05-29 16:31:13 Alaskans own 1,434,000 shares of PETRON CORP, worth $254,362. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in PHILIPPINES.

TCP shot itself in the foot with its beluga calving grounds terminal proposal.
5090 2018-05-29 16:30:37 My mother has been dissing me for years for running from hot oil. I'm sorry mama if the oil pop imma hop
5091 2018-05-29 16:30:35 Actually the #US is now a net exporter of oil. But regardless, that doesn't explain their appalling record of imperialism that I am very surprised to find, that you support. A nation that denies it's own citizens of healthcare and education in favor of military superiority.
5092 2018-05-29 16:30:31 Couldn't we just spend this money on an upgrader plant and have oil that can be sent in the typical pipelines with likely more jobs in Alberta? @ElizabethMay
5093 2018-05-29 16:30:29 Hate to tell you, but if you contribute to CPP, you were already an oil baron.
5094 2018-05-29 16:30:26 I need an oil change
5095 2018-05-29 16:30:22 87% of Alberta electricity is produced from fossil fuels. So yes. Vehicles can be electric, and single use plastic should be banned. We don't progress that way if we don't invest. Why is my money being invested in more oil?

5109 2018-05-29 16:29:12 However, the pipe that the Canadian taxpayer will finance is not for crude oil.  It's for the tar sands garbage that will need to travel by ship to Asia for processing, no?
5110 2018-05-29 16:29:03 Let’s be honest here, PM socks has stated, on record, that he wants to phase out oil.  The amount of BS Liberal red tape has made investors wary of investing in Canada.  Liberal gov screwed this up so bad, they are now buying a pipeline with tax payer money.

5113 2018-05-29 16:28:54 Let this be a lesson: Dressinng a salad on ~3 hours of sleep will result in oil in your bag, on the passenger seat of your car, on your pants, all over your desk, on your arm, and dripping down your face with every bite because you WAY overpoured.
5114 2018-05-29 16:28:39 BABY OIL!
5115 2018-05-29 16:28:36 So now keep Canadian oil here,refine it here,sell it here for what it should be,around 70cent and sell surplus to America at a heavily inflated price.
5116 2018-05-29 16:28:33 Well u lost me totally! I hope u roll up your own sleeves for oil spill & your wallet to help pay ! Shame on you!

5122 2018-05-29 16:28:08 Low oil prices also make renewables less viable. In fact the only way renewables make sense is because of gov intervention (subsidies). You actually argue against yourself.
5123 2018-05-29 16:28:00 Maybe Canada should buy a fleet of oil tankers too
5124 2018-05-29 16:27:57 This shouldn't be happening. K.m. should say no and put the pipe on the back burner til we can vote turdeau out. This is what his end goal was all along. He forced k.m to sell to FEDERALLY monopolize oil sands.

5127 2018-05-29 16:27:42 Because of Trudeau's decision on TM, besides everything else, Canadian taxpayers WILL be on the hook for any oil spills that may occur as well.
5128 2018-05-29 16:27:40 I think its alot more complicated than what is written. If Russia Venezuela and Saudi Arabia  step up Oil production and lower PPB Canadian Taxpayer could be left holding the SHiT BAG.

5132 2018-05-29 16:27:29 There is huge difference in the price of crude oil per barrel between now and back then.
5133 2018-05-29 16:27:24 I say this all the time. Can't pay a bill, fix a damn thing, or change my oil but expect to be king of a castle that I pay for, furnish, and supply food for.
5134 2018-05-29 16:27:22 ...because cooking potatoes in oil does create known carcinogens, this  statement is correct. Frenched fries are supposed to carry that warning,  too.
5135 2018-05-29 16:27:19 Because Putin told them both(Trump/Kim)to play ball and put on a good show, hopefully cause enough stress to boost the price of oil....but as long as we are scared and tuned in to the gong-show, right?
5136 2018-05-29 16:27:14 Good Morning, twitter.  Late start today because I had to get my oil changed (sadly, not a euphemism)
5137 2018-05-29 16:27:08 London gets our oil

I see there is no point having any further conversation on this issue.
But I should let you know Tesla started just in 2003 and has sold over 300,000 cars. Oil has been in circulation for over 100yrs. Electric cars won't catch up overnight.

Now this "Trans Mountain" project will send oil to China. Harper signed an agreement whereas China wont be liable 4 any oil spills. Harper started this mess.

We are so far behind Europe and China that's it's both an environmental and economical tragedy. I'll vote Green in the future, not Liberal.
5191 2018-05-29 16:23:21 Scandinavia moving away from Socialism - couldn’t afford to pay for it even with owning oil wells pumping barrels out by the minute! Medical care was also limited to proven Swedish, Danish, Norwegian citizens - #illegals and even other EU nation citizens were given no care.

5200 2018-05-29 16:22:27 As a family #Osteopathic physician, with a bachelors degree in Food Science Research, use whole olive oil for cooking and extra virgin olive oil for dressings and sauces. Whole olive oil has a higher smoke point. #JustDOit

5211 2018-05-29 16:21:53 Alberta Premier @RachelNotley on the turning-down-the-taps law (Bill 12): Because the crisis has passed for now – I don’t think we’re going to exercise it in the very near future #cdnpoli #ableg #bcpoli #oil #TransMountain
5212 2018-05-29 16:21:52 I've seen Cotton Seed Oil on the declared Ingredients in some Supermarket Raisins and Sultanas. So, not a pure product aside from the Fruit Blood Glucose rush.
5213 2018-05-29 16:21:50 You do realize that the pipeline is not going to pump refined oil and is going to be sold to the US to be refined there, right? We don't actually get fuel from Alberta in that manner, and bitumen is an exceptionally dangerous thing to transport. THAT'S the issue here.
5214 2018-05-29 16:21:37 The premier says because the" crisis has passed for now," she doesn't think her government will exercise Bill 12, which could be used to restrict oil exports to BC. #yyc #ableg

5216 2018-05-29 16:21:30 Economies are too varied to go into entirely, but most economies are based on trade of minerals and food.

Ground oill and fossil fuels exist, but bio-fuel is economic and accessible in this world, so oil is really only used for specialised things.

5223 2018-05-29 16:21:00 heheheh. CBC reporter @MBellefontaine points out to Noltey that if she constrains oil to BC come August, she’d be throttling a federally owned pipeline.
5224 2018-05-29 16:20:55 Why not plan to protest in the US as that is where most of these oil tankers go today?

If Canada does not ship oil to Asia someone else will. Huge tax $s to be used for teachers, schools, hospitals, nurses, roads, transit systems. No such tax rev available from solar or wind !!

5230 2018-05-29 16:20:37 And the 10 cents on gas you'll see for a week. The oil companies will come in and raise the price accordingly and the Tories will just say, "well that's not our fault." #OntarioVotes #onpoli

5238 2018-05-29 16:20:02 They have allies to protect, regions to stabilise and an oil supply to maintain.

5244 2018-05-29 16:19:17 “Literally starving”....you must live in Ab and never been to other provinces. I live in the industrial heartland of Ab and have a first hand view....you better wipe your glasses if you think this is tough times. That’s oil company and politician propaganda.

5246 2018-05-29 16:19:08 Also objectively we aren’t able to invest the way we could if we were selling oil at fair market value instead of getting a significantly reduced price at the well. But CNDs just vastly overpaid for this asset

5249 2018-05-29 16:18:58 In my conversations with Americans online the last few years their criticisms of Canada were, in order:
1. Dirty Alberta oil sands 
2. The shabby way we treat Indigenous peoples.

5257 2018-05-29 16:18:18 Oil demand growing worldwide to power the entire food industry, for example. Without oil & its cheap transportation options 100s of millions would starve today.

5291 2018-05-29 16:16:10 Oil has been as low as $9 a barrel and as high as $156 a barrel. Who wants to mortgage their children and their children’s future on a finite resource that will soon be finished and the price of which is simply un-calculable?
5292 2018-05-29 16:16:09 Its will be unfair to evaluate them out of context. Very few countries have been able to pull of what they did. They had just 2 months import cover early on in thier tenure,  the boys were bombing, oil prices were dropping and revenues were dipping (Rhymes).

5299 2018-05-29 16:15:22 All of that oil is going over seas. None will be used in Canada. It's mainly a pipeline that will be used for bitumen which needs heavy refinement. Plus the whole project is dependent on OPEC to ever make money for Canada. And OPEC has zero interest in doing that.
5300 2018-05-29 16:15:17 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
5301 2018-05-29 16:15:14 Absolutely wrong again @kennedystewart.  #TMX is safer than your neighborhood gas station.  Pipelines are far and away the most economic and safe way to transport oil. Why do you want to hurt people and the environment?

5304 2018-05-29 16:14:56 Naw for real chicken is literally one of the first things i cooked .. the only worry you should have is putting too much oil in the pan lol ..
5305 2018-05-29 16:14:45 Who will prefer all of that but we were all here when abuja was bombed everyday even on a day like this it happened, our economy was already on a decline because oil price was dropping and no savings, today we have less but see the money's invested in infrastructure see rail road
5306 2018-05-29 16:14:37 So everyone would rather transport by rail? Really! Or bring in Middle Eastern oil? No qualms about the pipes that bring gas into your house or sewer lines that take your shit away? BC, dreams don’t make your bed.
5307 2018-05-29 16:14:34 I'm outraged by your party's pro-oil stance @RalphGoodale. It will directly spend $10,000,000,000 moving more climate destroying oil to be burned, but won't spend a fraction of that on improving #Transit in Saskatchewan, or building the renewable energy we need now.

5310 2018-05-29 16:14:29 "Less exposed" does not mean protected.  The herd is getting squeezed from the wall street and hedgies calls to short the dollar and US treasuries. Their bullish oil call is also getting trashed. Everybody will feel it. Tax cuts will not save anybody.
5311 2018-05-29 16:14:17 @subaru_usa  I have 15k on my 2017 Impreza sport.  Oil light has come on 5 times and been quart low each time.  Have done 2 oil consumption tests and at 1200 miles is always right on.  Now doing a 3k test.  About to lose a 5x customer.
5312 2018-05-29 16:14:15 They can and my dogs do. My oldest lab (who’s a rescue) had really bad hips and going vegan helped a lot. Also started giving him CBD oil and now he is hopping all over the place like a puppy! 
5313 2018-05-29 16:14:10 This is one of the reasons Canada's crude is in demand and economically feasible as well as Venezuela's collapse and Mexico's decreasing oil reserves. Go Canada!

Stopped the Coconut oil last month and her hair is growing again.

5329 2018-05-29 16:12:54 The only people enjoying this democracy is Senators, Ministers, President, those calling shot in the oil sector & their families & those in their network. Nigeria is by them, for them and to them.

5333 2018-05-29 16:12:22 With the Trudeau Government's dislike of oil, is it concerning that all of Trans Mountain could be shut down if it's nationalized, the existing facilities included?

5337 2018-05-29 16:12:12 It's definitely possible! Your skin will start to purge as all the bacteria and dirt and oil surfaces from the products you use. If you keep on with the new routine, purging could last about 2 weeks. If your purging lasts more than 3 weeks there could be an actual problem
5338 2018-05-29 16:12:09 Projection is real. Iran wanted the oil in Iran so they accused Bush of trying to steal it. Racists assume every conflict between a Black & White must be race based. People only interested in money assume everyone elses intentions are money. Its rare when we're not projecting.
5339 2018-05-29 16:12:08 Well we found out my dog has very dry skin and she’s allergic to the chlorine in tap water so we give her spring water now. How long ago did the itching start? Maybe he just has dry skin?? We give my dog fish oil too? I’m not a pro  my baby has the same problem.

5353 2018-05-29 16:10:58 1) Agree the transition to clean fuels needs to happen, but to righteously proclaim it’s “dirty oil no one wants” is INCREDIBLY stupid. Alberta is a responsible producer of oil and is part of a greener future. The world demand for oil won’t go away because TMX doesn’t get built.

5452 2018-05-29 16:04:39 I'm long. Thanks for the report. But still need higher oil. Or explore a sale of the company. Is that possible? $CPG
5453 2018-05-29 16:04:36 Bruh Colorado has the oil game on lock but why’s their weed gotta be so goddamn awful 
5454 2018-05-29 16:04:35 India is facing oil crunch. Modi is wooing Indonesia. Trump has already conquered South China seas. Indonesia is sorronded by Australia & Japan. They can block oil tankers. If Trump succeeds in bringing North Korea to his side, then China will face the squeeze on oil.

5458 2018-05-29 16:04:16 This tar sands/oil thing is a nasty rock and a hard place. I hate it too, but the consultations have happened, research done, and the results are in. The trouble is SOMEBODY is always going to be unhappy.
5459 2018-05-29 16:04:07 Justin Trudeau screwed up Kinder Morgan so bad he ended up buying the company. KM gave him an ultimatum and taxpayers are now in the oil business. Any company executive handling a deal like this - FIRED ON THE SPOT. It's what you get with a camp councillor play-acting as PM.

5462 2018-05-29 16:03:58 I think you misspelled “oil” there
5463 2018-05-29 16:03:52 Haha no it's an oil drum and a boat
5464 2018-05-29 16:03:38 Are we going to get rid of the carbon tax now that we're doing all this for oil exports? No? Okay.

5466 2018-05-29 16:03:31 Piers has jumped off the deep end.
5467 2018-05-29 16:03:25 Read up on Venezuela.  Not many years ago, Bill Clinton suggested we model our country after them because they had great stores of oil. Today, their kids eat garbage.  Obama wanted a Socialist government and because he’s a smooth talker, ppl fell for his bs. Freedom ISN’T free.

5470 2018-05-29 16:03:05 The thing nobody talks about is that the current TMX already delivers 50% of BC's oil (both refined and crude), but the other share of the capacity is for bitumen export.

If we want to increase local supply, NEB can reallocate the share to do that with the stroke of a pen.

5476 2018-05-29 16:02:30 India cannot diversify oil import in short run to south American countries where currency has been hard hit or to Russia. India has emerged as good friend of Iran and needs to persue policy of strengthen ties with them as a long term goal which is mutually beneficial to both

5486 2018-05-29 16:01:36 i see your memory is as good as your knowledge of the oil market.  we had a brief, and not entirely unproductive, back-and-forth on gun policy the other week.
5487 2018-05-29 16:01:29 Got the sprinkler working with a little oil, just in time to hear my neighbour say, ‘It’s raining’. Time to turn the pressure down #gardening
5488 2018-05-29 16:01:24 The economy was doing well when Obama turned it over to Trump.  But thanks to Trump's "great deals"  the price of oil, gas, groceries, etc. have all gone WAY UP .... while wages stagnate.  And the value of the dollar has fallen 15% since Trump took office.

5492 2018-05-29 16:01:02 Because of how much people use palm oil, it makes it even more important for vegans to not use it. Those animals need us, and companies like @nabisco (oreos) will never stop using #palmoil unless more people refuse to buy them.
5493 2018-05-29 16:01:00 Okuuuur I use rosewater and then mix a lil Vitamin E with rosehip oil or aloe vera with shea butter
5494 2018-05-29 16:00:58 IS something that is "flamboyant" just something that is both flammable, and buoyant? Like Oil?
5495 2018-05-29 16:00:57 It's possible that the last oil refinery in the world has already been built, and we won't build any more.

Regardless, the oil is for export and doesn't feed any local needs. 

They can reallocate the current pipeline for local supply and remove current export share if they want

5505 2018-05-29 15:59:55 We need to stop looking at oil as a "long term solution" because it's a fixed resource… and the tar sands are causing HUGE amounts of pollution and toxic waste… Why not spend out time looking at greener energy instead?
5506 2018-05-29 15:59:54 Funny that your concern is for a *potential* oil spill on a pipeline where there will be constant monitoring and strict measures in place to prevent spillage and NOT the raw sewerage spilling into BC’s coastline that is actually happening. Mighty hypocritical of you!

5510 2018-05-29 15:59:39 And oil prices increased
5511 2018-05-29 15:59:38 Lmao nah. Finally learned how to make weed oil/butter. Been putting it in everything 
5512 2018-05-29 15:59:37 A quick reminder that US weaponization of the USD can only work sustainably if a stronger USD does not a) hurt US stocks at 150% of GDP; b) hurt oil prices (& therefore "US Energy Dominance Strategy"); c) Invert the yield curve (never good for a highly-financialized economy.)
5513 2018-05-29 15:59:32 Damn we all got hosed on this one. Free markets means let this project fail on it's own merits. Even with government aided de-risking KM wanted out because they see the writing on the wall ... cheaply fracked domestic oil is more profitable than tar sands right now.

5516 2018-05-29 15:59:18 The federal government, who cannot even procure a working federal pay system for its employees, plans to take on the responsibility of building an oil pipeline. What could go wrong? #cdnpoli #KinderMorgan
5517 2018-05-29 15:59:16 Ok,if u take'em as valuable, French enlightenment's ideals are absolutely inferior to those of US,wich are British Enlightenment+ judeo-Christianity

5525 2018-05-29 15:58:39 Its great that youre willing to learn more about it.  Apparently sustainable palm oil is "vegan". But in my mind its like saying humane farming is vegan, its more sustainable after all. I still stay away.

5531 2018-05-29 15:58:18 I predict this project will be similar to The Canol pipeline project built in WW2. Built/constructed by the govt, liberals will try to buy investor confidence, oil may get shipped, highly unlikely with govt involvement and then it will turn into most expensive hiking trail.

5539 2018-05-29 15:57:29 It's also not a sound long-term investment.  Regardless of how much various governments want to fight it, oil is on the way out and putting all your eggs in that basket is a recipe for a shit economy down the road.

5555 2018-05-29 15:56:39 Yes! If it hardens in the fridge, it sounds like it's liquid due to ambient temp (though there is a type called fractionated oil that's always liquid). But whether palm or coconut, refrigerate until hard to use, then store mix in the fridge instead of pantry.
5556 2018-05-29 15:56:14 Oh, this just in CP rail workers set to strike....hmm....what about those oil tankers hauled by rail because of lack of pipe capacity...oh guess more trucks on the road, or Trudeau govt legislates them back to work..Trudeau's pipeline chickens have come home to roost.

5565 2018-05-29 15:55:38 I propose we get the money from the other 98% of the economy and the existing record high oil production we have. This one dubiously devised pipeline is not even remotely the windfall people pretend it.

5575 2018-05-29 15:54:43 #Oil has always been my favorite investment. Bought $USL when #WTI was down at 47.45. It’s been a nice ride but had to lock in some profit. Maybe it’s still a long term uptrend but didn’t want to risk a steep short term fall if #OPEC eases supply cuts.
5576 2018-05-29 15:54:42 I don’t need to look it up because I went to school. Foreign policy affects the oil market. Pulling out of the Iran treaty makes oil prices less competitive. Now the SAUDIS can  & will increase the price with less market challenges. Gas increase was probably trump’s deal w saudis

5582 2018-05-29 15:54:14 @RachelNotley What is the economic argument for doing this over investing that money ($4.5B + ?? to do whatever else to get it operational) over investing it into renewable energy?Especially given oil's env/health/cleanup costs, and that renewables employ at a higher rate
5583 2018-05-29 15:54:08 4.5 Billion just for existing assets....then another 3-4 billion to finish the line...all coming from CPP funds. On a day that the UN has mandated that Bunker C fuel is to be phased out by 2020, and that's the primary use of Alberta oil
5584 2018-05-29 15:53:58 San nga ba gawa baby oil?
5585 2018-05-29 15:53:52 I understand, the creator of the series was a genius.

I was a kid when they first came out and those stories can be, at least read to be, dry. They did a great job making it interesting for a younger generation.
5586 2018-05-29 15:53:51 Was trying to explain to someone yesterday why I would not consent to a search of my home or car without a warrant.

Getting an oil change right now, and I just thought of another reason. Am I willing to bet my freedom on the mechanic not leaving a joint under the seat? Hell, no.
5587 2018-05-29 15:53:50 Ahhh the purity of green and ndp, oil bad, but burgers good, oil bad but gas guzzling trucks for union members good, oil bad, but new smartphones good, KM expansion is negligible in overall climate pucture, that oil will still go to coast, but by rail and truck creating emissions

5589 2018-05-29 15:53:44 When e listen to her voice all I do is push the mute button, it is as bad as a door that needs oil to quite the noise!
5590 2018-05-29 15:53:35 Well back too the oil field I goooo. Heading out Sunday!
5591 2018-05-29 15:53:33 China isn't buying. They have closer options. We are "decreasing" our intensity to be approach the intensity of other existing oil sources...maybe. Hardly a compelling reason.
5592 2018-05-29 15:53:33 This would make a great oil painting 
5593 2018-05-29 15:53:31 Evil's stand appears in different ways to peddle the same old serpent oil, I think SW is entirely accurate that you have smash it whenever it appears, no magic bullet, just smash it.
5594 2018-05-29 15:53:29 That is the first time I have every heard investment in oil referred to as sustainable economic growth. You should get a trademark on this brand new idea you had. Who cares that it is wrong?
5595 2018-05-29 15:53:27 Came in for a oil change and some how they found more problems I can pay for
5596 2018-05-29 15:53:17 Great link. Natural tension in Oil and Gas companies to allocate capital and focus on new energy sources vs core business. Key question seems to be what shareholders are looking for—mgmt often not rewarded for lower return renewables efforts.
5597 2018-05-29 15:53:03 yah i guess so, i know there is oil on the ground a lot so might be that too, but nothing i can do about :(
5598 2018-05-29 15:53:01 @IndiaToday # Tuticorinturmoil. The best joke @asaravanan21 of DMK says Govt was not on ground but they were there. We know why u DMK were they, not for help but to pour oil to fire by instigating villagers

Shame the Alberta Cons made sure Oil and Gas never paid more than pennies in royalty on our resources tho.

5609 2018-05-29 15:51:45 Why are gas prices so high though? Didn’t we open up some oil lines to start producing more of our own gas so we wouldn’t have to rely on importing so much? Wasn’t that supposed to drive prices down?
5610 2018-05-29 15:51:41 Saida says “2 parts canola oil to 1 part each olive oil and cider vinegar.”
5611 2018-05-29 15:51:25 If we're having such a glut of oil, what's with the constantly rising gas prices?
5612 2018-05-29 15:51:25 You can’t be anyone in the oil business without understanding the politics. But to go from there to Russian agent is a huge - but for some tempting - jump.
5613 2018-05-29 15:51:24 Sistas do shit like mix avavado oil into your coconut oil, then use apple cider vinegar to get the dandruff off your scalp, before they scrape the dead skin off your heels & shit… he ain’t know how much his life could get moisturized, if he fucked w/the winning team.
5614 2018-05-29 15:51:22 Luckily for us, we don’t have any oil/natural gas/diamonds or important minerals.

5620 2018-05-29 15:51:02 Want oil? 
With the Trudough Pipeline you will get even Morenow.
5621 2018-05-29 15:50:59 Tax on oil needs to be fixed slab wise. With a maximum of 18% from current 25. This will regulate prices to a greater extent.
5622 2018-05-29 15:50:52 You will be saying we are in the pay of Big Oil too in a minute. We see it all the time. We are not. We have NO vested interests and we are not paid by anyone.  You?
5623 2018-05-29 15:50:42 should I actually get my oil changed or keep testing how far I can get without changing it
5624 2018-05-29 15:50:30 Back on Broadway today from 11-1:30 with the same special as yesterday, The Popeye. Tomato sauce, spinach, leeks, kalamata olives, fior di lattes and blue cheese. Finished with Hojiblanca olive oil.
5625 2018-05-29 15:50:28 I am appalled by Trudeau’s decision today to use our money to pay for a pipeline we don’t need or want. Played like a fiddle by Big Oil in Texas. Not only do they get our oil, refine it and sell it back to us but now we pay them to do it. Stupid & Shameful.

5628 2018-05-29 15:50:15 RT ereguly: NaomiAKlein fullonelectric JustinTrudeau Canada's climate change policy was always a fraud. You can have the oil sands or you can have a credible climate plan. You can't have both and Canada chose oil. #green #ecofriendly #environment
5629 2018-05-29 15:50:01 No iftar is complete in Pakistan without fried items :p I wonder how many gallons of oil is used in #Ramadan in Pakistan every year 
#SufiJoNaamHaiAitmaadKa
5630 2018-05-29 15:49:51 Venezuela is actually a better example with what's gone on in the oil industry, nonetheless we're on the right path lol
5631 2018-05-29 15:49:50 Even the socialist Obama understood the need to  stabilize USA with domestic oil, the PMO must be taking advice from the drunken, criminal greens.
5632 2018-05-29 15:49:46 It’s time to use less oil. Less petroleum products.  Sorry tar sands but you effing suck. Yup i live in calgary
5633 2018-05-29 15:49:40 All I meant was that it’s based on Gers figures (debatable), and doesn’t include oil revenues, or the fact that with Indy we will be able to attract far more skilled migrants from the brilliant international students we educate. Just some of the factors that make me optimistic.
5634 2018-05-29 15:49:38 My dad washed my car yesterday after he changed my oil and two birds have managed to shit on my windshield already 
5635 2018-05-29 15:49:31 Well shit make sure her ac charged and she keep a oil change while you riding round in her shit
5636 2018-05-29 15:49:29 Canadians and @JustinTrudeau  and his out of country anti oil donaters are buying this so they can shut the pipeline down
5637 2018-05-29 15:49:27 History repeating itself. Liberals build Crown Corporations.  
The minute those corporations show a profit, Conservatives win power and destroy them.
Rather have this money go into a Crown oil refining investment and then ship the product. As per Lougheed.

5642 2018-05-29 15:49:01 I talked to God this morning, and He strongly suggested I not send the dude a dime till I get a gallon of his fat-free miracle snake oil elixir and a swatch of holy prayer Egyptian polyester!
5643 2018-05-29 15:49:00 I have put the second coat of oil on to these two tables today, ready to be dispatched to their respective customers. The taller one is to be placed next to a BBQ for serving

5650 2018-05-29 15:48:32 Oil will always be marketable and moreover the politics of oil and solar will find a balance once the price of crude oil doesn't go too high
5651 2018-05-29 15:48:30 I’m surprised Alex hasn’t included actual snake oil in his supplements. I guess ground up chicken bones will have to do.
5652 2018-05-29 15:48:27 Good for you for taking the high road and using reason, logic, and a calm presentation of the facts in the face of such hostility. Cervantes tells us that "truth will rise above falsehood as oil above water."
5653 2018-05-29 15:48:16 Wouldnt make sense. China will likely expand its carbon levy onto fossil fuels & AB is the only heavy oil jurisdiction in the world that’s decreasing the CO2 intensity of the product - we are likely to see a jump in demand & subsequent need for higher output. #ableg #TMX #cdnpoli
5654 2018-05-29 15:48:13 Do you know the breakdown on the price per gallon? How much does the oil company make per gallon, and the service station? How much of the price is tax? Who's the real greedy person in all of this?
5655 2018-05-29 15:48:11 No worries, me too, #chamath also as many more, don't get why people are bashing #ElonMusk big oil as always... Have a great day!
5656 2018-05-29 15:48:11 Why do I get a feeling you're a shrill for the oil industry and a Harperite climate denier? Glaciers are melting in the Rockies, Arctic ice mass is decreasing, sea level rise will slowly flood land & cities etc, etc. And you're sticking your head in the sand...
5657 2018-05-29 15:48:10 With respect, the biggest mistake anyone who opposes this kind of stuff makes - and I see it all the time - is to quote publications that have (and sometimes, are very open about) the majority of income from sources heavily involved in fossil fuels. NR is well known to take oil $
5658 2018-05-29 15:48:02 Even under 2C scenario, the prospects for Canada's bitumen are bad.  Our oil is especially emissions-intensive to produce and also costly, so can be expected to be the first to go when global markets transition away from oil. This is a financial bet against success of Paris Ag.
5659 2018-05-29 15:48:02 Control western Canada. Once they control the flow of oil, they control the cost of transportation. There's big money in transmission pipelines. That's why Kinder Morgan and TCPL worked so hard and invested so much $$. Govt control will screw everything.
5660 2018-05-29 15:47:51 “Once market conditions would allow it to get the best price” When May that might beworld  is moving away from high cost oil and renewables are the name of the game today. Corporate welfare is alive and well in 
5661 2018-05-29 15:47:51 The magic pipeline! 4.5 Billion of public money goes into one end and dirty private oil money comes out the other side! #Abracadabra #KinderMorgan #canpoli #TransMountainPipeline

5664 2018-05-29 15:47:42 How can you assert this? If TMX is built, there will be considerable governmental revenue from improved oil prices thanks to non-US market access.

5670 2018-05-29 15:47:12 This is a not a “win” for the oil business, Cdn business or Cdn society at large.  Capital, project mngmnt expertise, risk mngmnt were not lacking at Kinder Morgan. Law enforcement and political will were lacking.  Has that changed with this decision?
5671 2018-05-29 15:47:10 Came to the Agg just for a oil change, now I'm "Mr Uber Eats" 
5672 2018-05-29 15:47:04 America is one of the world's largest oil producers, and close to 40 percent of U.S. oil needs are met at home. Most of the imports currently come from five countries: Canada, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela and Nigeria. Which of these countries are we at war with? None
5673 2018-05-29 15:47:02 Does that include the use of CBD oil to treat cancer or seizure or what not
5674 2018-05-29 15:47:01 Domestic oil production at its highest ever

5678 2018-05-29 15:46:50 Ghada__Makhoul Great question Ghada! Olive oil should not be heated to a high temp, only a low temp/saute or use straight from the bottle. :) RT
5679 2018-05-29 15:46:50 AmicableSavage Use oils such as avocado oil, coconut oil, macadamia nut oil or olive oil. Be careful of heating olive oil at a high temp, keep it low heat or room temp.  :) RT
5680 2018-05-29 15:46:47 I love food writers who offer up a delicious recipe, saying "you don't really need anything else" then add that some bread, a bowl of butter lettuce, dressed with lemon and oil, maybe a few new potatoes, and a little lemon souffle for pudding "might be nice."

They are my people.

5684 2018-05-29 15:46:42 Raptors are hella nice but the location of the oil filter is a bitch !!!!
5685 2018-05-29 15:46:41 Give your head a shake! Enforcing federal jurisdiction is allot cheaper than buying a pipeline!  But the citizens need to make better choices for the environment through carbon tax while our federal government buys oil pipelines!  Do you know how stupid your tweet makes you look!
5686 2018-05-29 15:46:34 Failure to address B.C. and other opponents concerns over the years regarding to t he Trans mtn pipeline #oilspills has resulted in reaching a dead end and now a
4.5 billion cost to Cdn taxpayers to preserve and protect jobs and  government oil revenues.
5687 2018-05-29 15:46:32 @Michaela I love watching HLN, your show in particular. I understand that this is not your department within the CNN Corporation, but I am sick of seeing these commercials for the Prevagen supplement. This company is a proven fraud, and peddling nothing but snake oil.
5688 2018-05-29 15:46:29 but doesn't the price of oil factor into the cost of the assets? geo-political risks on the horizon (not least being US-China trade war) will affect that.
5689 2018-05-29 15:46:27 The worst investment ever for the Canadian people, 15 years from now 90% of vehicles on the road will run off electricity. Oil for plastics, paint, etc etc  will be plant based. You don't have to be Nostradamus to see this. Sure glad Justin Trudeau's not my financial adviser.

thanks to tax cuts, booming profits & credit 
 In the wake of higher oil prices
5691 2018-05-29 15:46:22 In case thee was any doubt that JT and the liberals are owned by the oil lobby
5692 2018-05-29 15:46:20 Asked Nat Resources Minister Jim Carr about construction costs of pipeline, on top of $4.5b purchase. He wouldn’t give a number but said oil companies paying to use the pipeline will provide significant revenue stream, suggesting — I think — this could offset additional costs.
5693 2018-05-29 15:46:18 Has Nigeria moved on from depending on oil for government revenue?
Has the population especially of students increased?
5694 2018-05-29 15:46:15 Now his government owns the shut off valve for the sale of Alberta's oil

5696 2018-05-29 15:46:07 Soros was 14 at the time and was just trying to survive. You want to go after someone, go after the Kochs who got their money from Nazi oil. They're the ones that own the politicians, not Soros. Get your priorities straight.

5699 2018-05-29 15:46:03 Jane, at last! A thoughtful Scottish Nationalist!
Would you tell me more about the rape clause, please, and also what the advantages for Scotland are as an EU federal state with no or much weakened defence?
Salmond said you'd be like Iceland with its 'Good' Banks. Oil has tanked
5700 2018-05-29 15:46:02 Depends on the brand  and the objective. For THAT olive oil you well know I went to the supermarket aisles and observed interaction with product and then asked a series of questions
5701 2018-05-29 15:45:55 When I do this whole thing, I don't have to apply any more product for the rest of the week at least! I usually put my hair in 4-8 braids at night, and in the morning take down with a little oil on my hands and it usually looks better as the week goes on IMO (I love big hair)
5702 2018-05-29 15:45:44 I cannot help but think all this is a plan to steal more territory from the Palestinians. This strategy has been used ever since evil corporations wished to unjustly control other country’s resources. Watch the Golan Heights, as I hear it’s oil rich! Africa is in danger of doom.
5703 2018-05-29 15:45:41 Another tough day has come to an end... I have not yet bumped into my designated oil tycoon... Aluta continua!
5704 2018-05-29 15:45:29 @cliffnationwide heard John on oil price forecast grateful he is not a investment planner. Having him spewing false chatter endorses his political jaunt on all JA airwaves that new listeners will begin to believe like in the US and you know the result
5705 2018-05-29 15:45:29 Be ready to go to Israel to buy another oil.
5706 2018-05-29 15:45:27 Starving. Lol. Maybe if Alberta had kept some of those royalties instead of giving all their oil profits to multinationals...
5707 2018-05-29 15:45:26 It’s a hard white chocolate wax, so no strips the wax gets hard and she rips the wax itself off. It’s infused with coconut oil
5708 2018-05-29 15:45:25 Also Norway did that decades ago when oil was still relevant long term.
5709 2018-05-29 15:45:25 Check your Engine oil this morning.
5710 2018-05-29 15:45:22 nah it works. you should use the thicker version as a spot treatment.  like castor oil consistency. not the watery shit. that’s better for toning the skin.
5711 2018-05-29 15:45:13 the anti oil supporters of  @JustinTrudeau will see that the pipeline never gets built .
5712 2018-05-29 15:45:13 Don't forget CNOCC bought Nexen at 4X market value in 2011 to get a presence in the AB oil patch.FIPPA with China was ratified a year later, with hearty Liberal backing. JT is a hearty backer of a free trade pact with China. I surmise the KM buy is a quid pro quo with China.
5713 2018-05-29 15:45:11 Look it up. I've always had that stance. Oil is to global.

When Obama's in yes the Dems took credit when low. So does the republicans

The oposing party always says the president doesn't have anything to do without it

Economist agree little effect by policy
5714 2018-05-29 15:45:10 I’m sure I read that oil soaked wood and Lemonade was in the product line at some point 
5715 2018-05-29 15:45:10 @BJP4India Cant you reduce tax on the petrol and diesel to make it cheaper ..Even when crude oil was 28 dollar/barrel govt raise the tax and the benefit didnt pass to the govt..It is clear that modi govt is only focusing towards either poor class or rich class..
5716 2018-05-29 15:45:09 GOOD FATS: Avocado, Fish, Almonds, Walnuts, Peanuts, Cashews, Olive Oil, Coconut Oil, Seeds, Coconut, Olives, Peanut Butter, Low-Fat Dairy

5722 2018-05-29 15:44:17 Good question Dustin, we hate to be the bearers of bad news but we've discontinued our baked line of chips. We do still have our 40% reduced fat Sea Salt chips and Avocado oil line if you're looking for some new main chips!
5723 2018-05-29 15:44:09 @KlasraRauf  After adding overhead charges by operators and gas companies, LNG actually cost more than crude oil. Keep in mind that brent crude is around 10% expensive as compared to crude we purchase from gulf countries.
5724 2018-05-29 15:44:05 For gel cream you could get Neutrogena hydro boost gel cream and the oils from The Ordinary. Rosehip seed oil is also good at lightening scars
5725 2018-05-29 15:43:55 I don't. I don't want *anyone* to be in the oil business. But they keep telling us we have no choice. So, if we have no choice, why not take full control to be better able to ensure a Just Transition™?

5728 2018-05-29 15:43:44 Interested to hear how you would get our oil to tide water.
5729 2018-05-29 15:43:44 Fresh brewed iced tea with about 4 drips of lemon essential oil, and a cucumber, avocado salad with homemade tahini sauce. 
Refreshing
5730 2018-05-29 15:43:41 Wait til they find out they're losing money because tar sands oil and it's route is the least efficient way to get oil to market. So we take the risk environmentally and fiscally. Who really cares what citizens think.
5731 2018-05-29 15:43:40 Find in that is Pure CBD....it shouldn't have any taste except the oil itself
5732 2018-05-29 15:43:38 おっぱい！おっぱい！！！
5733 2018-05-29 15:43:35 Great question Ghada! Olive oil should not be heated to a high temp, only a low temp/saute or use straight from the bottle. :)
5734 2018-05-29 15:43:34 lmao, i pray that y’all are not putting tea tree oil (diluted or not) all over your face. spot treatment only guise

5736 2018-05-29 15:43:13 Yup - they choose to live near & work in the oil business 
5737 2018-05-29 15:43:10 I feel a moral obligation to tell the world to get rid of candida also stop eating fat. Fat raises your blood sugar. No coconut oil, almonds, butter, avacados etc. How I got rid of it
5738 2018-05-29 15:43:08 @BJP4India Hi though I am a supporter of BJP but tell me one thing when Crude oil rose to 110 Dollar/Barrel during UPA then also fuel price was less as compare to today price ..Why govt don't want to pass this benefit to common man like us..
5739 2018-05-29 15:43:05 I think people are seriously misinformed as to how many pipelines we actually have....and in our history of developing the oil sands in the first place.
5740 2018-05-29 15:43:02 Either do liberals! Had they enforced federal jurisdiction their would be no need to use tax dollars to build a oil pipeline! Enforce a carbon tax on citizens and buy a oil pipeline! EH!
5741 2018-05-29 15:42:48 Why does Canada feel the need to export energy resources instead of developing industries and growing economies at, or close to, the energy resources? Historically that's been the story of energy discoveries until Middle East oil discoveries last century.
5742 2018-05-29 15:42:45 Use oils such as avocado oil, coconut oil, macadamia nut oil or olive oil. Be careful of heating olive oil at a high temp, keep it low heat or room temp.  :)

5746 2018-05-29 15:42:33 The point about not giving away oil royalties - as Alberta did, for short-term political gain - and investing those royalties sensibly still stands. #ableg #canpoli
5747 2018-05-29 15:42:29 If it's possible to lose money running an oil pipeline, I expect the Liberal government will do it.

5750 2018-05-29 15:42:23 The whole of Twitter should be held in contempt of court. Hence the reasoning behind the application to lift media black out.
5751 2018-05-29 15:42:22 More jobs, and more sustainable jobs. Average wage in renewables sector is $92k. Investing in oil expansion is madness.
5752 2018-05-29 15:42:21 I note with interest that the Conservatives' fallback position is ideological. They want TMX. They don't want government. They didn't mind oil sands bailouts over the years.
5753 2018-05-29 15:42:18 pretty crazy comment we are dealing with heavy oil here it really doesn't affect gas prices whether we have the pipeline or not BC does not nor will not get any of the produce from heavy oil. That and even if it did it's refineries are working at 94 percent it cant do it
5754 2018-05-29 15:42:18 Hydration works bests in light layers for people with combo skin. So like a gel cream would be best. You could also add an oil like rosehip or squalane which are both good for combo/oily skin cuz they're dryer oils and give that extra level of moisture if the cream isn't enough
5755 2018-05-29 15:42:11 Light dep’d with the last 4 weeks 2 weeks before and after solstice?    

I’ll agree with that

Full season though, fall harvests in Canada simply don’t have the DLI to produce the same kind of high oil cannabis as indoor or Light dep
5756 2018-05-29 15:42:03 wash w/oil-based cleanser, rinse, then wash again w/water-based cleanser. oil vs water-based cleans different types of pore-clogging gunk. i have huge pores that clog easily

5768 2018-05-29 15:41:18 Dr. Lori, what about olive oil if heated or cooked on high temp.? Any alternative pls?
5769 2018-05-29 15:41:15 You can believe what you want but the large project proposals such as Suncors Lewis and Teck’s Frontier (among others) are very inconvenient to your theory about investment in the oil sands.

5772 2018-05-29 15:41:03 When inflammatory oils high in omega 6 fat, such as vegetable, canola, sunflower and corn oil are cooked over high heat, they release toxic chemicals called aldehydes that have been linked to dementia, cancer, and heart disease.  #inflammation #cancer #dementia #heartdisease …

5775 2018-05-29 15:40:47 I think electricity transmission lines and oil pipelines are both important types of infrastructure. 

The ownership structure of each type of infrastructure differs by jurisdiction- there’s nothing inherently ‘public’ or ‘private’ about either of them.

5790 2018-05-29 15:39:39 @KlasraRauf  impression is given  that LNG is 13.37% of brent crude oil.  it is like "per million Btu of LNG will be 13.37% of the last three month average price of brent crude oil. As there are around 5.8 Mil Btu in one barrel of brent so LNG is 5.8*13.37 = 77.54% of crude oil.
5791 2018-05-29 15:39:31 palm oil is so much easy to find, but never find the solid one. btw, the refined coconut oil I used is liquid, but it will be solid when i keep it in refrigerator (maybe bcos indo is tropical), do u think its possible if i make n store the brownies mix in cold temp?

Period !

All that they had to do was to make sure proper government approvals were put in place for the pipeline and private industry would have done the rest.

5825 2018-05-29 15:37:59 Hi Catrin,
I can completely see why you're concerned about this. Palm oil itself is not poisonous to dogs, it does have a laxative effect if eaten in large quantities so can cause sickness & diarrhea if overfed. Much of the risk from palm oil is thought to derive from 1/2
5826 2018-05-29 15:37:58 Skyrocketing interest rates, oil & gas prices, declining job growth & wages and a tax cut for billionaires, pandering to the richest televangelists and attacking a constitutionally protected free press and the right to protest while enriching his family is unprecedented.

Took longer to get to sleep last night than the other 2 days where I took it 3 times per day. Might need a stronger dosage. Feeling good tho. #CBD #CBDOil #CBDOils #CBDLife
5840 2018-05-29 15:36:50 @benshapiro, you are a supporter of a neo-zionist Israeli Government who hide behind the guise of a jewish state to bomb Syria to get their oil, murder innocent Palestinians, and occupy a land(Golan Heights too) that was stolen by the NWO Rothschilds. Right?
5841 2018-05-29 15:36:46 It’s really lovely! Also their Peace Bath Oil! I have a website but feel free to browse their page too. The Ebo ones are also beautiful. I’ve just gone from spring to summer oil (in hope of one)!

5847 2018-05-29 15:36:05 It is so disheartening that people give snake oil salesmen like Hannity any credence.  Fox even admits to being the voice for Trump and "reports" & "opines" to cast everything he does in a rosy glow. I always want to know the truth whether it is good or bad for ANYONE I vote for.

5926 2018-05-29 15:29:41 Just because oil leaks doesn't mean disaster follows. There are contingencies in place which were immediately enforced. The situation was so minor, it never would have made the news. However, it did because of the timing. That's all. Simmer down on the sjw nonesense.
5927 2018-05-29 15:29:38 Oil for Food yielded enough money to feed the children of Iraq. But we could not force Saddam not to use that money for himself and his circle. Also, wasn't aware that U.S. bombed hospitals in invasion of Iraq. Will check.
5928 2018-05-29 15:29:34 So, some dime a dozen tech geek promotes his industry, and no one complains, but when someone tries to promote a legitimate, essential, industry (oil & gas), dozens of angry trolls attack. Consider yourself trolled, limp wrist.

5931 2018-05-29 15:29:14 No. Just incessant tax breaks to foreign oil companies. Same thing. Now you and I own something that could make a profits for Albertabsxamd Canadians.

5943 2018-05-29 15:28:56 The Canada emerging market finally pulled the trigger to nationalize a portion of an oil pipeline. Canadians can now start the clock on future spending and wait for another buyer. It also confirms that the oil sands will be supported by Canadian taxpayers for decades to come.

5946 2018-05-29 15:28:45 Our Canadian government would rather spend 4.5 billion on a pipe line to send oil to India for next to nothing that helpe indigenous people of turtle Island Canada have clean drinking water and suitable housing

5969 2018-05-29 15:26:45 People who swear by the Mario Badescu rose water spray are the same people who rub coconut oil all over their face because “hey it works for me”
5970 2018-05-29 15:26:41 Another one who wants scots to stay cos we would lose a handout!
So you actually think that resource and oil and gas rich scotland needs bailed out by the oil less gas less resource free country next door?
And your case for union is scots would lose a handout !
5971 2018-05-29 15:26:40 CBD oil.
5972 2018-05-29 15:26:36 in 5 years time oil will not be marketable anymore..every car are going solar...
5973 2018-05-29 15:26:34 Did Marley invest the oil and not smoke? If he only smoked then this point is mute.
5974 2018-05-29 15:26:27 I’m a vegan so I can’t have butter lol. I add MCT oil and coconut oil, soooo good!!
5975 2018-05-29 15:26:24 Total is keen on its reputation. Hence I am sure it will take all the necessary actions to avoid any oil spill and to control it if it happened. Concerning BP I think that the best oil company is the one that does not cause any accident (but BP did ...)
5976 2018-05-29 15:26:20 Not smoking .. the oil .. the go on an alkaline diet ...
5977 2018-05-29 15:26:18 The oil industry can’t even clean up the mess they leave behind from abandoned wells. They don’t have the money to clean it all up... you’re welcome
5978 2018-05-29 15:26:14 ですねえ……
5979 2018-05-29 15:26:08 I know one is supposed to start somewhere but I don't see one pipeline making a dent in climate change, esp when the oil will just be sold to the USA at a discount. And they in turn will sell equivalent amount for export and profit.
5980 2018-05-29 15:25:52 Imagine sabotaging three oil pipeline projects and then nationalizing an entire pipeline because the polls turned against you. #cdnpoli
5981 2018-05-29 15:25:51 I smell like leave in conditioner and Jamaican black castor oil 
5982 2018-05-29 15:25:50 Awa to lather masel in carrot oil and cut around costa del tayport when a get home at this rate
5983 2018-05-29 15:25:48 Most people wouldn't think to wash it, so all they are doing is rolling old oil from previous uses all over their face. Hygenic.
5984 2018-05-29 15:25:47 ok, twitter drinking game. shots for:

every girl in the cactus swimsuit 

every girl in the flowy, white striped pants

every time ya see a fuhkboi tweet ab how much he wants to treat a girl right
5985 2018-05-29 15:25:43 You'd think @JustinTrudeau would have learned from his dad on getting the federal government involved in the #oil industry. Didn't go well last time with the national energy program and won't go well now. Welcome back to the 1980's. #bcpoli #canpoli
5986 2018-05-29 15:25:40 case for the union , anything more than 9% of North sea oil which is righfully 100% Scottish is a burden.

Noway , "I object".
5987 2018-05-29 15:25:33 As Canadians, we should be grateful that the Trans Mountain pipeline will never be built ... that's a comfort  But to see $4.5 billion WASTED by corrupt, desperate ideologues on something even for-profit Texas oil corp Kinder Morgan openly says is "untenable"...  #cdnpoli
5988 2018-05-29 15:25:32 This guy believed his snake oil hussle and did so without so much as a google search, good god
5989 2018-05-29 15:25:26 Remember when BC said we need to lessen our dependence on oil. Then Alberta cried and cried because foreign companies had pulled out of there years before Libs or NDP came in. Then, scared Trudeau ties us closer to a dying resource, showing his neo-con stupidity
5990 2018-05-29 15:25:26 I slept so hard last night. That workout was amazing. Then I exfoliated and put my sleep therapy oil on, Chile I was in heaven!
5991 2018-05-29 15:25:25 The higher gas prices are directly related to Donny prematurely pulling out of the Iran Deal. Oil production was reduced so prices would go up. The global market will make his “America first” policies painful for us.
5992 2018-05-29 15:25:24 Gusto ko ng spag, palabok, carbonara, fries, nuggets, chili oil ng chowking, steamed siomai ng chowking, yangchow or Chinese fried rice, butter lemon chicken, buttered shrimp, zinger, coleslaw, veggie salad. Craviiiiings.

5994 2018-05-29 15:25:05 Also, it's not possible to get a prescription for CBD oil because the Feds have deemed it's have no medical benefit and classified it as a #supplement .  Drs cant write prescriptions for it
5995 2018-05-29 15:24:49 With CO2 levels hitting 412ppm & record global warming highs passed year over year & wildfires, drought and extreme weather now our norm, the future for oil drilling must be over in your city. Young people will hold those in power today personally responsible & act accordingly.
5996 2018-05-29 15:24:46 May GOD and thunder fire who ever posted this rubbish you are a criminal in disguise why is benue state the food basket of the nation and yet nobody is putting effort to develop the states because it is not an oil producing state @MBuhari what a cruel governments the real devils

5999 2018-05-29 15:24:25 It would be nice if President Trump would do something other Presidents have only talked about, build a couple new gas refineries.
 We've got all this oil now, put it to use and get the price of gasoline down !!!
6000 2018-05-29 15:24:22 Wikipedia: An essential oil is a concentrated hydrophobic liquid containing volatile aroma compounds from plants. Or you google am already?
6001 2018-05-29 15:24:10 I don’t know if it’s a mental trick but my car always seems like it drives smoother after an oil change
6002 2018-05-29 15:24:07 in indonesia  hard to find refined solid coconut oil, mostly liquid - refined or unrefined. and if there's any, must be for skin/hair treatment, so its quite pricey  but i'll try search it again, thanks!
6003 2018-05-29 15:24:06 The smell of tea tre oil is just eww but it helps with everything
6004 2018-05-29 15:24:05 PLEASE CANADIANS FEAR THIS!! The government of Venezuela used this very method to make oil a completely nationalized, public operated industry. The sector is now in RUINS, and inflation in the thousands, ALL OF THIS IN 15 YEARS. People are eating their own pets to survive.
6005 2018-05-29 15:24:04 oil painting?!? that to?!?!

6008 2018-05-29 15:23:39 Yaaaa olive oil?
6009 2018-05-29 15:23:38 You sold out to big oil like the dinosaur you are meanwhile bankrolling a private company out of a problem. This money would have been so much better on green energy projects. You bow and follow when you should lead. Shame.

6016 2018-05-29 15:23:02 Our President is doing everything possible to make US non dependent on foreign oil. Watch #REAL NEWS !
6017 2018-05-29 15:22:49 Sure, just ignore the THING that has half the country calling the other half liars, cheats, and wrong. This “investigation” is what is killing our country. We need answers, now. Until we get them this country will stay oil and vinegar.
6018 2018-05-29 15:22:49 Trump and the GOP don't care Anna, they don't care about their own why would they care about Nicaragua? Unless they have oil or something that would make Trump look good.
6019 2018-05-29 15:22:42 Nymex wti crude oil buying level $65.50 to $65.15 not active. .... cancelled the call. ...
6020 2018-05-29 15:22:36 KM probably jumped at opportunity to unload and get the hell out of Canada. Most US companies have already exited the oil sands.
6021 2018-05-29 15:22:36 Magic! I honestly can’t explain it I just  know at most we use a table spoon of oil (olive oil or coconut oil) normally. It makes the crispiest fries (normal or veggie)

6026 2018-05-29 15:22:18 Our High School Car Clinic was a huge success! Students learned how to: check their oil, fluids and tire pressure, change a tire, how to attach jumper cables, and they located their VIN number, spare tire and jack!

6029 2018-05-29 15:21:33 @sheldonstash  Surely you can lend a hand to " Little @AllenLone " he has a mess at v.aao and v.moo. He cant make profit with oil at $70 us. and now has some convoluted screw the shareholder deal written up. Please suggest he resigns and real leaders take over. Thanks
6030 2018-05-29 15:21:24 I wouldn't put coconut oil on my face for love or money!
6031 2018-05-29 15:21:24 Recently heard that if you store the jar upside down, it’s much less messy to stir ‘cause the oil ‘rises’ to the bottom. Disclaimer: I haven’t tried it yet!

6034 2018-05-29 15:21:16 Oil price went up because of Russia and Saudi curtailed supply. Now they decided to lift supply ban and as a result we are witnessing crude price slipping.
6035 2018-05-29 15:21:12 Nikki what is your suggestion on how we move our oil? Would you rather fuel up millions of trucks and haul it or run it on rail through our major cities? Which do you support?
6036 2018-05-29 15:21:10 Just real quick though.... Without solar, oil, hydroelectric or nuclear, how exactly do we meet our green initiatives again?
6037 2018-05-29 15:21:04 So I got weed yesterday, brought it to my room and now my whole room smells like it. I should of just gotten oil instead and this wouldn’t be a problem

6039 2018-05-29 15:20:55 We’re the worst carbon emitter on the planet and we’re doing nothing to change that. Either the oil industry gets cut drastically or we admit complicity in massive displacement and death.

6073 2018-05-29 15:17:55 The down slide in the international crude oil market has just started. In India, demand for the fuel is also much higher than in any other country in South Asia. So, simple economics--the higher the demand, the higher the price.

6093 2018-05-29 15:16:21 JS, KAZ is 1/175 or so Russian companies to go private and mainly due to the oil price decline of the last 5 yrs or so.  Oil is coming back, the recent DUMA issue, and the lo U3O8 price may add pressure to hold off the IPO.  Part of the IPO set up was the creation of THK (arm).

6096 2018-05-29 15:16:08 Andrew Bell on BNN says oil industry happy with the TMX decision but not happy with gov't involvement. The industry didn't mind PET bailing out Syncrude in the 70s and Chrétien bailing out the oil sands with tax-breaks worth $300m/year for about 15 years. #cdnpoli #abpoli
6097 2018-05-29 15:16:05 I'm citizen of South Carolina and I disagree. The future is clean energy. Our country could be at the forefront but, friends of oil and coal don't want that to happen so, our state should be bold & take advantage.

6099 2018-05-29 15:16:03 Wrong.
Trade deficit = 150-160
Services surplus = 50-60
Remittances = 60

So tht leaves a BoP gap of arnd 40-50, depending on oil prices. Need tht amt of capital flows to bridge - shdnt be an issue, but INR remains under pressure..

6101 2018-05-29 15:15:46 Defending Buhari is no different from a man blaming his wife's former lover for his (impotence and) inability to get an erection to impregnate his perfectly fertile wife

Oga, e nor dey work! Four more years and lubrication ($100/bbl oil price) will not jack bros up.

6103 2018-05-29 15:15:44 Global refining capacity is set to surge, making any new investment a truly terrible idea, as oil products are fungible.
LTO, from the US, is not akin to WCS, as a grade. Think - why grow turnips when there are so many carrots, because vegetables?
US refiners NEED heavy crude.

But petrol price have rose to upto ₹86.67 in Mumbai.

6113 2018-05-29 15:14:39 Thank you for this, back to you, please, make sure you go through different literatures, to understand how things work behind the curtain, there are a million discreet agenda within any legal activity. In Banks, Oil, Health and everything you see.
6114 2018-05-29 15:14:36 Like father ... like son (even if daddy thought he was the idiot son). Now all he needs to do is build some cost-over-runned refineries for that oil in BC so they can give them away in 10 years. Keep buying that Saudi oil!
6115 2018-05-29 15:14:33 The Fed’s have been supplimenting oil and gas for decades. Stop with the garbage.
6116 2018-05-29 15:14:29 Investment in Canadian Oil is flooding out of the country, but Trudeau thinks he can use taxpayers $ to buy a pipeline & then seek investment to finish the project. This whole thing is going to be a colossal failure, but don't worry, only taxpayers $ is at stake. #KinderMorgan
6117 2018-05-29 15:14:24 @narendramodi @PMOIndia Global crude oil prices has scaled down to mid $60 from $80 in last fortnight.
But petrol price have rose to upto ₹86.67 in Mumbai.
6118 2018-05-29 15:14:21 Yep. With a father who has worked in gas and oil most of his life, I’ve always understood increased gas prices actually means its better for US economy. This concept seems to be hard for many to understand.
6119 2018-05-29 15:14:18 Oil change @EskridgeLexus. Great people...my pal Shannon Brown will hook you up with a great Lexus!
6120 2018-05-29 15:14:15 Yup, just like Chavez nationalized oil companies in Venezuela. Turned out great didn't it?  
6121 2018-05-29 15:14:08 Pipeline & it’s far more hazardous than what’s to be built. Do you realize that all those rail cars carrying oil mean that farmers rush to get their crop on the train only to be turned away because on the entire train there’s only a few grain cars? That means they don’t get paid
6122 2018-05-29 15:14:00 me “don’t eat that it’s baby oil”

6125 2018-05-29 15:13:48 But central bank suppression of gold and silver will not last. The ramp up in inflationary pressures that are still to come. This is why interest rates are surging, along with oil + other commodities, which have ended a brutal bear market and begun a new bull market.
6126 2018-05-29 15:13:32 Russia worked to damage Hillary's campaign in exchange for lifting of sanctions (incl: $800,000,000 in oil leases).  That's not nearly as complicated as the Birther Conspiracy unless you watch Fox News.
6127 2018-05-29 15:13:25 Venezuela is rich in oil. Though there are plenty of reasons why we wouldn't want to do business there at the moment.
6128 2018-05-29 15:13:22 I too am extremely concerned about oil spills. We all need to focus on this to ensure better, safer pipelines now & in future. Remember, this proposed pipeline will run parallel to existing pipeline. My greater concern is increased traffic by sea to transport oil from pipeline.
6129 2018-05-29 15:13:16 my next oil painting will be giorno to nobody’s surprise

6134 2018-05-29 15:13:00 Exactly why is FG being held accountable for what was allocated to the states? The same way some people hold FG responsible for misappropriation of 13th percent derivation fund to oil producing states...

6139 2018-05-29 15:12:43 The skin aqua sounds great but I’m leaning towards Australian Gold - the oil cleanser I use is basically mineral oil + when I wear makeup it’s bare minerals powder. I think my skin *might tolerate this sunscreen. 

Thank you! 
6140 2018-05-29 15:12:14 Maybe freeze it first, or toss some frozen gel packs in with it? If it gets above 75, the oil will liquify and make the mix into a total mess.

6145 2018-05-29 15:11:50 Crude oil inventory postponed to 31st.8.30??????????
6146 2018-05-29 15:11:48 Wow even prepaid oil changes are getting expensive, should mentioned that labor cost when I signed up Fuckers

6148 2018-05-29 15:11:45 Its always a good idea to warm up your oil whenever cooking with it not heat it up
6149 2018-05-29 15:11:42 The feds and Canadians will come out of this with more money. Anytime in our history when Canada invested in the oil and gas sector it has been lucrative. This will be no different. Never should have got to this but here we are.
6150 2018-05-29 15:11:42 Yep. Made out of pure oil. Meaning the value will just increase over time
6151 2018-05-29 15:11:42 CE means the oil suitable for certain heavy duty turbocharger or supercharger engines.
CF means the oil is for use in high speed, four stroke cycle engines.
SAE Viscosity ratings-This rating reflects the oil's ability to flow at various temperature.
6152 2018-05-29 15:11:39 Sim, é muito liquida e oil está em alta, mas tem o governo como sócio. É está casado com a mulher do ex-executivo da Yoki. Vc dorme bem e acorda em pedacos numa mala .

6160 2018-05-29 15:11:01 Our alliance with Israel is about two things. 1. Watching over “our oil” interests in the ME, 2. Protecting access to the Suez Canal. As soon as those aren’t interests, the US would gladly throw Israel under the wheel of the bus

6166 2018-05-29 15:10:45 What happens to the $1 billion B.C. was promised Andrew? You going to tax us even more to make up for that, or will you and Johnny boy shut down hospitals? You murderer.
By the way, KM transports oil. Price is irrelevant.
6167 2018-05-29 15:10:37 How would KM have paid for construction? By charging fees to oil companies to use the pipeline. The government will do the same. As long as the pipeline is making a profit, it won't be hard to find a buyer. If your suggesting it won't be profitable, show us your evidence.
6168 2018-05-29 15:10:34 You do realize that Canada ships the majority of its oil & has to the states just to be resold to us at a higher price right? So why is it a terrible thing to have a SAFE, EFFICIENT way to transport out resources to CANADIAN refineries? Watch as trains go by, THAT is our current

6172 2018-05-29 15:10:27 coconut oil isn't meant to be used on the face anyway. it doesn't penetrate the skin. so it will clog your pores and make you breakout or even dry out your skin in the long run

6178 2018-05-29 15:10:11 If you are currently suffering from a sunburn like me try this little mix: water, peppermint oil, tea tree oil, lavender oil and aloe. It's extremely soothing to the skin while helping repair!
6179 2018-05-29 15:10:07 I did that once and my eyelash got ripped off I legit didn’t have eyelashes for a MONTH until they grew back (applying castor oil day/night). It’s super heavy on your eyes and NOT worth it at all every 2 weeks you have to go and get it filled in

2- OOPS time to cover shorts price of oil dropsHOW ABOUT GAS PRICES?????
6182 2018-05-29 15:09:56 the point of all this being? They did not need or want to sell it but I imagine a big premium on its value will be paid out. Sounds a lot like Selling our oil to the US at less than market value. Who is really pulling the strings here?

6186 2018-05-29 15:09:16 It’s so hot in my house that my jar of coconut oil is now in liquid form
6187 2018-05-29 15:09:16 @NealKirby @AmyAHarder It's an underappreciated gift. However, while no fan of the current CAFE system with its perverse incentives and other distortions, if the net result of the shale oil revolution is bigger, less efficient cars we will have blown a great opportunity.
6188 2018-05-29 15:09:12 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
6189 2018-05-29 15:09:07 Mix it with a carrier like coconut or olive oil so it’s not going directly on the skin

I’m not saying it’s right, I’m saying companies aren’t moving in on renewables & families need to be fed somehow.
6199 2018-05-29 15:08:27 Instead of a national clean/renewable energy policy that would create far more permanent jobs than the temp jobs in building the pipeline — & would mean far more revenue for  Gov't — of course the fake Liberals aquicsend to the wishes of their masters: Big Biz, Big Oil &

6205 2018-05-29 15:07:37 Now, if any oil is eventually transported to market by this pipeline, it will be so expensive due to "tolls" and carbon taxing, it will only be sold at a discount on the international market.  Sounds familiar. #TransMountain

6217 2018-05-29 15:06:57 Once the oil is gone, or more likely not needed, we can use it for moving water to grow crops!! Desalination plants on the west coast to feed the parched prairies, run by site C power
6218 2018-05-29 15:06:55 We buy there palm oil , but they are not buying our non basmati rice.
6219 2018-05-29 15:06:52 All of a sudden politicians who advertise their hate for privatizing strategic infrastructure are now firmly against government-owned infrastructure. In the meantime every day thousands of trains cross our towns and cities filled with oil waiting for a disaster to happen.
6220 2018-05-29 15:06:50 Canada is buying the Trans Mountain pipeline because of obstructionist Canadian attitudes towards oil from Alberta.  Well everyone will pay!  Will the demonstrations stop?  Premier Notley is trying to show the benefits to all Canadian of diversifying our sales.  A little late.
6221 2018-05-29 15:06:45 It was a Conspiracy Against the USA. With a hostile foreign nation. Trump had a deal perhaps (highly likely) with Russia to make billions by removing sanctions for oil drilling in the Arctic. The GOP are scoundrels - look the other way, nothing to see here - Massive Corruption.
6222 2018-05-29 15:06:44 Why not nationalize the oil sands?  Makes perfect sense.  Eliminate the dirty capitalists.

6230 2018-05-29 15:06:08 I guess you could say that. The apostles all said Jesus was the son of god and he rose from the dead. The apostles were also killed in the most awful ways for their faith. Skinned alive, boiled in oil etc. Liars make bad martyrs
6231 2018-05-29 15:06:03 Um...broadly speaking I agree, with the proviso that:
A) NOTHING works homeopathically
And
B) Misreporting like this is particularly irksome as cannabis oil IS an effective treatment for a number of things-just not this. It undermines legitimate use.
6232 2018-05-29 15:06:01 most ships were from Venezuela, Algeria, sometimes other countries... never domestic. And we had three locations, Bayonne, NJ.. Philadelphia, PA and Houston TX. Third, I have friends that live in Alaska. They get money from the pipeline, but not the oil.

6234 2018-05-29 15:05:57 Dipping their small balls in boiling oil and then rubbing honey on it before putting them in a room full of rats - could be a workable idea, or?

Job Description.

A fast-growing startup Oil & Gas company wants to hire a
6237 2018-05-29 15:05:28 Your head get oil
6238 2018-05-29 15:05:17 Knotley can take her disingenuous apology and shove it. She is traitor to environment to all present and future generations, to democracy and to all British Columbians and Canadians. You couldn't buy our forgiveness for a zillion barrels of oil you sold out to big oil hypocrite.X
6239 2018-05-29 15:05:12 Or it could have been some guy with a rental U-Haul truck with fertilizer and fuel oil blowing up a government building in Oklahoma. Bad guys will do bad things no matter what laws we have.
6240 2018-05-29 15:05:08 He is not a nut. He is a snake oil salesman.
6241 2018-05-29 15:05:06 There are many types of seizures that require a multitude of drugs to be taken with only marginal effect. Cannabis CBD oil has been shown many times to stop some forms of seizures almost completely and with no side effects. This is a safer and cheaper option in many cases.
6242 2018-05-29 15:05:04 PM Trudeau now owns a pipeline and is sending oil to the west coast.  How will he square that with his enviro supporters?  And what could go wrong with the government owning and building the pipeline?
6243 2018-05-29 15:04:58 Bet the Chinese state oil company would buy.....that would be an interesting case of acrobatics
6244 2018-05-29 15:04:54 흐흑 진짜 차라리 제가 가는게 더 마음 편한거 가타여 뭔가 누군가 여기에 오시면 데리고 갈 곳이 없어서 몸둘 바를 모르게꾸(? 막 그래요.. 흐흑... 마싯는것을 먹여드리고 시픈데 말이에요....
6245 2018-05-29 15:04:53 If I buy a vape for liquid to help a nigga quit smoking ciggs can I also use that to smoke cannabis oil
6246 2018-05-29 15:04:47 @CNBC $XOM Refiners on a tear, where is $XOM With 37 oil refineries in 21 countries constituting a combined daily refining capacity of 6.3 million barrels (1,000,000 m3), ExxonMobil is the largest refiner in the world
6247 2018-05-29 15:04:45 Why does getting your oil changed have to be so expensive
6248 2018-05-29 15:04:45 Potable water is the new Oil
6249 2018-05-29 15:04:43 SUBSIDIES!!!!! I knew it was coming. Still shocking to read. Campaign promises from 2015 broken.  IMO Canada a deep oil state! Yesterday Trudeau addressed #c72018  he said his government would price carbon and build pipelines.  That is how the day ended #G7Charlevoix
6250 2018-05-29 15:04:41 (2) &NO damage done during construction,&I don't see any issue with building your pipeline. I've seen first hand the damage &destruction done building oil wells and rig sites in Northern Alberta,yet nothing gets done to fix it &35 yrs later it's still a wasteland,go figure!
6251 2018-05-29 15:04:36 Piers it’s is clear there is personal reason for such ink. Most people do have tattoos that represent a meaning in there life. The tattoos is tribute to his father and has not even been finished, I’m sure it well more relevant image once completed. #Media #ScapeGoat
6252 2018-05-29 15:04:34 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
6253 2018-05-29 15:04:28 Owning an export pipeline doesn't nationalize much of anything. We still don't own the oil or a refinery.

We are just hewers of wood once again
.
6254 2018-05-29 15:04:27 Next time I’m going to YouTube how to do my own Oil Change I swear. And find hella coupons for my oil as well lol .
6255 2018-05-29 15:04:25 In our world, people are used to fighting for resources like oil and minerals and land. But when you have access to the vastness of space, you realize, there's only one resource worth fighting over. More time. Time is the single most precious commodity in the universe.
6256 2018-05-29 15:04:20 ★★★★★ Bought the 725mg Full Spectrum CBD Oil, High Grade Hemp Extract (50mg/ml), check out my review!
6257 2018-05-29 15:04:19 Oil is not going away fast enough so we might as well ensure we get top dollar dor ours!! NDP govts fault the Feds had to step in.

6259 2018-05-29 15:04:18 A cleaning potion or return to its original condition potion...to sprinkle over oil spills, the Great Barrier Reef, the floating garbage island ect....
6260 2018-05-29 15:04:07 Everyone's saying this is a $4.5B purchase of a pipeline. Keep in mind there's also an ~$8B construction project too.  The feds just put us on the hook for >$12B of oil infrastructure. #KinderMorgan #TMX
6261 2018-05-29 15:04:03 I need an oil change that isnt $200! Bennys come back!
6262 2018-05-29 15:03:59 The Libs overturning Gateway, moving regulatory goal posts on Energy East, pandering to pipeline protesters, implementing the carbon tax & calling for the elimination of the oil sands ultimately created the business environment for this bizarre precedent.
6263 2018-05-29 15:03:57 You used valve oil on rotors? FAIL! You must come back to Band. Do not pass go, do not collect $200.
6264 2018-05-29 15:03:48 Putting coconut oil in your hair at least once a week over night will change your hair so much (in a good way) my hair has never been this healthy 
6265 2018-05-29 15:03:43 "I've never heard of a dish that uses cold noodles. I'm not known to be picky though, I'll have an order of that please." Octane says with a grin as he takes out his coin bag. It too was stained with oil. "How much is it?".
6266 2018-05-29 15:03:37 I wanna make a big breakfast but I need potatoes olive oil foil turkey bacon seasoning salt pepper and garlic powder... so if anybody want to go get that and bring it to me they can lol
6267 2018-05-29 15:03:30 エヴリンが好きだなぁ
6268 2018-05-29 15:03:20 i don’t measure tbh hahaha but get an empty bottle, i just used my old empty Vit. E oil bottle and i put about an equal amount of rosehip oil, argan, jojoba vit. E. and i only put a very small amount of tea tree just to help my breakouts. shake it up before use
6269 2018-05-29 15:03:11 mamshie susunugin ko na factory ng cèleteque tonight bakit sila ganito mas nagkaroon ako ng pimples at mas nag oil
6270 2018-05-29 15:03:04 @JackieDeAngelis Has the Administration articulated a strategic policy to unlock the domestic oil distribution choke points?
6271 2018-05-29 15:03:03 Ok u can take off your makeup with coconut oil. And also most ppl using coconut oil as anything else on their face have gotten used to it and it doesn’t break them out
6272 2018-05-29 15:03:03 They only love brown/dark skin women when we thick and covered in coconut oil irl they think we roaches or cute for a brown/dark skin

6275 2018-05-29 15:02:51 Oil change  but boy oh boy it’s not cheap at all for this oil change smh
6276 2018-05-29 15:02:50 First of all... I work for a school and our insurance goes through a consortium. We usually get the lowest rates out there. 

Second, I worked in a oil testing lab where our inspectors would go out to meet barges and ships, whether they were loading or discharging. Most ships
6277 2018-05-29 15:02:49 The Canadian government bought an oil pipeline. Sort of depressing because climate change is real, and the people who say they are working to stop it, aren’t.
6278 2018-05-29 15:02:44 someone with a fancy moisturizer: this only has tea and organic ingredients in it! plus it exfoliates, leaving my skin invigorated and nourished, AND it minimizes my elbow wrinkles! AND-
me, stepping out of the shower and covering myself in baby oil: look how shiny i am lol
6279 2018-05-29 15:02:39 Oil prices boiling but our conveyance not changed sir
6280 2018-05-29 15:02:30 They may not protest, First nations Reserves make huge amounts of money from the oil & gas industry & have many of their residents employed in the oil industry. Don't forget that First nations people working for first nations owned companies don't pay any income tax!
6281 2018-05-29 15:02:29 Just when I thought Piers was recovering from his brain damage.
6282 2018-05-29 15:02:18 Dozens of First Nations don't have fresh drinking water, yet we can find $4.5 billion to prop up an oil company? Seriously? #KinderMorgan
6283 2018-05-29 15:02:02 How did your last fill-up go? Thank be sure to thank the Prez for killing the Iran deal and there by causing a jump in gas prices. Yup, just send your “big tax cut” right to the big oil companies. SAD!
6284 2018-05-29 15:02:00 Oh dangit. & I know the maintenance is high as heck. Never have I ever paid for over a $100 oil change.
6285 2018-05-29 15:01:34 Muudze kuti ukuseka her olive oil
6286 2018-05-29 15:01:21 I think I shouldn’t have to pay for the gas that gets made from any oil that goes through my section. 
6287 2018-05-29 15:01:18 bio oil!! meskipun agak lama
6288 2018-05-29 15:01:17 Annual oil subsidies = $3.3 billion
Trans mountain expansion = $4.5 billion
Glad to see the @liberal_party showing it’s true colors. Makes it much easier come election year.
6289 2018-05-29 15:01:14 Go ahead and slide me the recipe of that oil mixture and measurements please lol
6290 2018-05-29 15:00:51 Yes. €16 is background noise against oil price & other fluctuations. But tax & dividend (promoted by @citizensclimate, @TheCLCouncil, @SforCD, etc.) redistributes from heavy polluting minority to lighter polluting majority, making it politically possible.

6293 2018-05-29 15:00:47 The time to nationalize an oil pipeline was 40 years ago when it was prosperous & profitable. Once again Liberals looking where the puck was, not where it's going. #KinderMorgan #cdnpoli #KeepItInTheGround
6294 2018-05-29 15:00:42 はいあがった！はいsnake oil！
6295 2018-05-29 15:00:31 I have a problem with people suing oil companies for climate change when it’s public demand for oil products that fuels o&g production. Also, using AC and driving cars spews emissions as well
6296 2018-05-29 15:00:30 お、よい子はハンターさんに任せて寝る時間だぞ！
6297 2018-05-29 15:00:27 @LauraMercier tinted moisturizer oil free but you would need to use the regular version because you have dryer skin than me
6298 2018-05-29 15:00:24 0時です。今日も一日、オイルと共に頑張りましょう。
6299 2018-05-29 15:00:16 Like a vampire, he drinks oil out of robots.
6300 2018-05-29 15:00:04 Dislike: Oil slick
6301 2018-05-29 15:00:00 “The oil and gas sector [...] has a chance to spend its prodigious capital on AI [...] to improve overall efficiency, environmental sustainability and other key metrics” says @edmonton_ai co-Founder @AarynFlynn. @ABInnovates #Inventures2018 #TheNextBigThings #FutureEconomyCanada
6302 2018-05-29 14:59:52 HERESY. An admixture of oil and butter is permitted for frying eggs - the butter for flavour, the oil to prevent the butter browning - but for scrambled eggs, as whatever you're using will be combined with the eggs and affect the taste, only butter will do.
6303 2018-05-29 14:59:44 またね！いってくる！
6304 2018-05-29 14:59:33 Sunset industry? Hardly!  The IEA estimates the world will consume 850 BILLION bbls of oil between now and 2040. At current prices that's about $60 Trillion in oil sales...some sunset industry...
6305 2018-05-29 14:59:31 oh yeah, we started with oil & it was hilarious, but we found ourselves having to continually reapply... then thought we'd try a slinky. it has served us well, but we may iterate to other ideas. it sure is fun for the whole family
6306 2018-05-29 14:59:29 I feel sad every time baca or dengar orang cakap “saya pendatang” or “saya kafir”. It feels like there’s a wall between the two. Oil and water.

6308 2018-05-29 14:59:15 Guyyyssss a friend recommended that i start taking black seed oil for all my problems and its like $25 so i figured why not and i highly reccommend it for the trippy dreams alone
6309 2018-05-29 14:59:13 "Great customer service! This was my second time coming for an oil change and I will be coming back again :)" @Groupon #HappyCustomer
6310 2018-05-29 14:59:04 Oil US$75.5/bbl vs US$78.4/bbl last week
6311 2018-05-29 14:59:01 @proportionalplt Candace, I just made your "Fresh Ginger Cake" this morning. Outstanding recipe. Wow, thank you for sharing it internationally. I substituted some oil for the egg and it turned out fine. Glorious, ginger flavor. 

#CANADA
6312 2018-05-29 14:58:59 We can't since we signed an international trade agreement that means we can't lower our price of oil unless everyone does type thing.

Even if we refined it here we'd still have to sell it at the same price.
6313 2018-05-29 14:58:47 It's more efficient to transport by pipeline then rail.  The oil is going west already.  This way we have rail capacity to ship grains & pulses. To curb the industry you have to lower demand not supply. What oil products r u wearing today? #itsnotjustfuel
6314 2018-05-29 14:58:43 Mmm me da a poca luces, cortito y armado para juntar chorros, mafiosos, Narcos, impunidad y otras mañanas q no pudo concretar el Sr. Tinelli. En su totalidad. La muestra d Oil, e ideas d Sur y otras q no sabemos en detalles como el cierre d Scioli
6315 2018-05-29 14:58:42 "Alberta Premier applauds PM Trudeau's plan to nationalize oil infrastructure".  Sometimes I wish I could send headlines back in time. #cdnpoli
6316 2018-05-29 14:58:38 Try use cleansing oil or baby oil.
6317 2018-05-29 14:58:25 a hate myself for thinkin a medium protection tanning oil wouldn't burn me lmao
6318 2018-05-29 14:58:24 I’d like to see @JustinTrudeau commit the same amount of money to renewables as he’s now spending to prop up fossil fuels & build an outdated pipeline—but that would be too forward-thinking.

Counter to conservative claims, dirty oil gets far more public money than clean energy.
6319 2018-05-29 14:58:20 love that opening a gif on twitter takes over the speakers on my phone, it's really cool and good that oil companies directly contribute to these natural disasters and then make a killing off the panic.
6320 2018-05-29 14:58:15 I did  was great! 
Some things I learned: 
Truffle Oil =Mobil 1, will never ever order the Salmon special at a restaurant  And a few other tidbits , etc. Keep up the good work 
6321 2018-05-29 14:58:14 question: quite hard to find refined coconut oil, other option? or if i use unrefined coconut oil/melted butter (so the brownies mix without oil), can i pour it with water & egg? or it'll change the result? 
6322 2018-05-29 14:58:07 Oh dear. We need betta weather for you. Not the time for colds & cough. To many late nights perhaps watching Joe on youtube , ahh take care  Anne. Get good meds. Vit c. Olibas oil. Chicken soup. Early nights. Lots of love   
6323 2018-05-29 14:58:05 didn't people need different things.

perhaps that's not the right method.

here's an article i read about CBD oil, which doesn't have the same mind-altering effects.
6324 2018-05-29 14:57:51 So you could go through, how many barrels of oil a day with that combo?
6325 2018-05-29 14:57:51 That is bargain basement money.  Oil brings in BILLIONS in revenue!
6326 2018-05-29 14:57:47 so CÉLETEQUE AKALA KO BA OIL CONTROL YUNG TONER NYO BAKIT OILY PA RIN MUKHA KO
6327 2018-05-29 14:57:39 It was fine way before Trump instability was inserted. During Obama’s years we lead in oil production and gas prices were low and the economy GREW.
6328 2018-05-29 14:57:31 肝心なことを忘れていました。（ひとりごと
6329 2018-05-29 14:57:25 Just like selling petro canada to private industry at the oil price bottom in 2000. Crooks
6330 2018-05-29 14:57:25 Public Service alert;  Jesse Duplantis said " God told me to tell you to buy me a 54 million dollar jet"....please be wary of this snake oil salesman !   He is one of TBN's  finest false teachers......
6331 2018-05-29 14:57:17 In 2013 speech of our Honourable PM said that petrol prices are very high. Lets us come we will reduce Petrol prices. Suddenly crude oil crashed in international mkt & it was 40 dollar /barrel, then Mr Modi increased Excise duty on Petrol which went upto 57%. No benefit to ppls.
6332 2018-05-29 14:57:09 I saw "$4.5B oil buy out" trending on Twitter and immediately assumed that Chiarelli panicked and bought out Lucic, Sekera, and Russel's contracts.
6333 2018-05-29 14:57:04 Accepted :)
My issues are Indigenous Rights and the Constitution Act, a fear of oil spills (KM had 1 this wk in BC) and other environmental factors, a continuation of funding obsolete technologies, and I dont feel it appropriate for the gov to step in when corporations fail
6334 2018-05-29 14:57:04 Carrot oil and raspberry seed oil although the science in support isn’t advanced
6335 2018-05-29 14:56:57 Then provide the oil if u want it to be delicious to ur palate. Others consider it sweet
6336 2018-05-29 14:56:53 The claim the oil embargo was designed to provoke the Japanese is BS no matter who says it. The oil embargo was intended to interfere with Japan's ongoing invasion of China.
6337 2018-05-29 14:56:43 Russia does owe Damascus its own survival, had Syria accepted the Qatari gas initiative back in 2007 Russians would be starving by now, and their country disintegrated, instead, Syrians had to suffer to protect Russia and Iran from oil & gas exports embargo & kill the terrorists.
6338 2018-05-29 14:56:41 Today McDonalds gave me a regular Coke on accident and I feel like I'm drinking sugary motor oil. Sigh. Agree to disagree.
6339 2018-05-29 14:56:19 Taxpayers, you are now in the oil pipeline business. What do you think?  #Cdnpoli #TransMountainPipeline #bcpoli
6340 2018-05-29 14:56:14 Buy oil and pour it back
6341 2018-05-29 14:56:12 New tires for the truck  then a oil change 
6342 2018-05-29 14:56:04 尾根に上がったら水はないもんなぁ…

6343 2018-05-29 14:55:58 Never thought that while I’m looking like a bay bay kid just getting an oil change that someone would insist on having my number  I just want an oil change
6344 2018-05-29 14:55:57 Not peanut butter o..Groundnut oil true true
6345 2018-05-29 14:55:54 No money for healthcare, but billions for an oil company from Texas. I will never vote for the @liberal_party or @JustinTrudeau again.
6346 2018-05-29 14:55:45 I was getting a lot of acne on my chin last year with bad dry skin and I started putting bio oil on the really dry bits which helped me after a few days and the tiniest dot of salicylic acid on the spots to help treat them but not dry out too much
6347 2018-05-29 14:55:44 "climate leader" @JustinTrudeau now literally going to buy a massive oil pipeline in our name. The only words I can think of right now are swear words. #canpoli #climatechange
6348 2018-05-29 14:55:27 Eventhough may “combination” na nangyari, mas mataas dapat c remy kaysa kay makoto kasi nasa bottom two c makoto kahapon. And they were in thesame day, kaya their sequence between them should be as is. Unless, may cooking oil na ginamit kanina sa scores.

6351 2018-05-29 14:55:15 took me days to get the oil out the lil boy's hair 
6352 2018-05-29 14:55:11 It is an artificial low supply of oil, but sometimes this is the only way to push the global economy to adopt Renewable energy platforms/sources for the long term.

6362 2018-05-29 14:54:57 Talking about Oil and Euro, are we? 
6363 2018-05-29 14:54:55 Hi, Luke. We're unable to give you a part number, however, we'd be more than happy to arrange for your vehicle to have an oil change at your local Audi Centre. Please, could you message us privately with your postcode, number and VIN?
6364 2018-05-29 14:54:42 What a joke, pure propaganda
Us soldiers die for oil, gold and other resources
6365 2018-05-29 14:54:37 Oh, and a splash of olive oil, say 30g per kg of flour.
6366 2018-05-29 14:54:31 Imagen all the benefit to the planet. No drilling for oil, no smog, and omg no traffic or car accident. Please could some brilliant mind out there look into making this happen....Rowling....
6367 2018-05-29 14:54:28 I learned to check the oil and fluids in my car yesterday! It’s never to late to learn 
6368 2018-05-29 14:54:25 Lol, who’s been paying all the bills for the last 30 years? Do you have any concept of how much infrastructure oil money has built all over Canada in the last 3 decades?  Your welcome and enjoy the pipeline
6369 2018-05-29 14:54:18 my glasses are covered in oil paint the smudges will never get off fuck
6370 2018-05-29 14:54:16 Apples and oranges.  The tax cuts did not cause oil to increase.  And without the cuts, people would really be in the hole.
6371 2018-05-29 14:54:03 left brain: you should practice drawing bc ur rusty and this drawing class is gonna be hard
right brain: more oil paintings!!!!!!!
6372 2018-05-29 14:53:40 We don't have to go far look at our Francophone neighbours Ivory Coast Senegal and I think Niger. All have refineries but no oil minus Niger but use some manner of discounts to keep prices fixed.
6373 2018-05-29 14:53:40 Eventhough may “combination” na nangyari, mas mataas dapat c remy kasi nasa bottom two c makoto kahapon. And they were in thesame day, kaya their sequence between them should as is. Unless, may cooking oil na ginamit kanina sa scores.
6374 2018-05-29 14:53:37 Covered in oil. Drinking sweet tea. And listening to country. I couldn’t be happier rn
6375 2018-05-29 14:53:34 2013 crude oil 120$ per barrel # petrol price 71.35 
2018 crude oil 75.o9$ per barrel. Petrol price 78.58 per litre in Delhi.

Side effect of achche din
6376 2018-05-29 14:53:27 Pls drink water to it now, if oil no dey
6377 2018-05-29 14:53:27 @BobCorker must be sniffing out a place in the cabinet. He hears there are some Mighty Fine Oil deals right Rex?
6378 2018-05-29 14:53:17 Key facts on India & #Indonesia trade : 
1) Indonesia is India’s second largest trading partner in ASEAN
2) Bilateral trade between India and Indonesia stands at 20 billion USD in 2015
3) India is the largest buyer of crude palm oil from Indonesia
6379 2018-05-29 14:53:16 The flatmate's cooking maid just used apple cider vinegar instead of oil and the whole house smells of armpits and wet socks and a 100 onions all at once.
6380 2018-05-29 14:53:09 I know many Iranians whos only concern has been Israeli and US provocation and creating a poorer economy via embargoes all because of Oil  ... and this man Nader is unable to identify with this or his home town I'm now more suspicious than ever.
6381 2018-05-29 14:52:55 Untuk saat ini dressingnya gak enak..malah enakan sebelumnya lebih berasa lemon dan olive oil + madu.
6382 2018-05-29 14:52:54 Everything is a balance. We could cease all oil production but that would end economic growth, lead to cuts in all government ficnded programs like health and welfare. There is not hard science saying that these ridiculous carbon targets will make any difference.
6383 2018-05-29 14:52:47 Only force limiting impact of cost overruns on consumers is ability of shippers to revert to rail.  Depending on project cost overruns rail may turn out cheaper.  Or will govt lock in oil shippers to use the pipeline at any cost??
6384 2018-05-29 14:52:36 castor oil really do help your eyebrows thicken 
6385 2018-05-29 14:52:14 Baby oil and a coarse sea salt scrub. Let the baby oil sit on it for 10 minutes and then use the sea salt scrub.
6386 2018-05-29 14:52:10 What side are you on in the mineral oil vs tung oil debate
6387 2018-05-29 14:52:08 Hi Dan, we'd encourage consumers to choose products that contain certified #sustainable #palmoil. By increasing demand for CSPO you help us in our mission to protect #forests and #wildlife in areas where palm oil is harvested.
6388 2018-05-29 14:52:03 Clients: our walk schedule is backed up due to the oil spill on route one. Please be patient while we get to them as quickly and safely as possible! Thank you in advance.
6389 2018-05-29 14:52:02 Oliv oil, waktu itu gue salah kirim chat kkt ke elu kan?
6390 2018-05-29 14:52:02 Ah, that's not so helpful then! If you can tolerate the oil drops under your tongue, I would recommend that for a general background painkiller and sleep aid. Play around a bit with dosage to see what works for you. Good luck!
6391 2018-05-29 14:52:01 I listened to the first bit while driving this morning and the truffle oil bit was hilarious. I had to look up the composition after the motor oil comment and it turns out that one of the bigger synthetic aroma compounds (isobutanol) is used in many car paint polishes.
6392 2018-05-29 14:51:54 This pipeline will help farmers who are currently suffering because they cant get their grain on rail because our railways are backed up trying to transport our oil rather than grain. 

Pipelines provide the safest mode of transportation. #Pipelines produce LESS GHG emissions
6393 2018-05-29 14:51:40 んー？はいー？
6394 2018-05-29 14:51:38 Think of all that extra revenue once oil starts flowing in these pipelines.
6395 2018-05-29 14:51:35 @JustinTrudeau Have you READ economic facts about Alberta Oil Sands? ie ”Alberta bitumen will likely be a big loser, (in shipping fuel market) because it contains on average some 11 times more sulphur than conventional crude,” how can u even THINK about backing it w. our $$$??!!!
6396 2018-05-29 14:51:35 Of course, so much better to move oil by train or truck. Like it or not, petrol is still used in the world...
6397 2018-05-29 14:51:26 Aap ko petrol price kam lagta hai Sir. Maharashtra mei ₹ 86. 34 aaj ka price. Yeh toh jab Crude oil price 110 dollar per barrel tha tabhi bhi nahi tha. Aaj ki date mei crude oil prices are 84 dollar /barrel. See the fact Sir.
6398 2018-05-29 14:51:26 buti pa yung oil, 'baby' ;<
6399 2018-05-29 14:51:25 @JustinTrudeau You bought what for 4 billion dollars from a Texas oil bully? You got played, just a #Conservativewearingred. Disgusted.
6400 2018-05-29 14:51:24 What Phoebe said.

Plus it's only a matter of time until there's an oil spill, and Canada/BC will have to pay to clean it up, not the company.
6401 2018-05-29 14:51:22 Mix a can of the kippered snacks with a spoon of mayo or miracle whip and a smidge of mustard. Put on crackers with a dash of hot sauce. Nummy nummy. Oh BTW, after drinking the olive oil Justin, your bathroom festivities might get a bit...um...interesting. Just fair warning.

6403 2018-05-29 14:51:16 Tasek Bera...was a beautiful natural lake in Malaysia and biggest as well. But now the lake is almost "dying" because of logging and of course massive plantation (palm oil) activity by FELDA.

6405 2018-05-29 14:51:15 How about spending $4.5 billion on access to clean water for the thousands upon thousands of people who don't have access, or... spend $4.5 billion on clean energy initiatives.  How will we ever drop oil @JustinTrudeau ?

6409 2018-05-29 14:51:06 Least it’s blatantly clear @JustinTrudeau really represents oil corporations. Biggest phoney Canadian politician out there. Global warming right.You don’t give shit about global warming or you would tried changing ’s energy policy like Norway and rest progressive  doing
6410 2018-05-29 14:51:02 Now that the Canadian government is bailing out the Texas oil company with the uneconomical project can the existing pipeline be required to have actual safety and environmental standards. Motto has been all spills all the time so let's do something about that

#cdnpoli #ableg
6411 2018-05-29 14:50:45 Daaaaaamn $30 to fill up the tank  I guess that’s good for me tho since I’m in the oil business
6412 2018-05-29 14:50:43 Baby oil! It will save your life. The tan literally just comes straight off xxx
6413 2018-05-29 14:50:43 Then provoke the oil if u want it to be delicious to ur palate. Others consider it sweet
6414 2018-05-29 14:50:35 With this thing about KFC being at rum bucket... Please remember that oil on top alcohol nah mix! This is a recipe for disaster with the mist disgusting hangover for no reason...You welcome in advance

6417 2018-05-29 14:50:13 Actually oilsands royalties have been increased. Unless you mean the sliding scale was recently at bottom owing to a generational collapse in oil prices.

6419 2018-05-29 14:50:07 Is there an existing proposal that you would prefer? I take your point that data doesn't create value on its own, but neither does oil (to use the current cliché). Isn't there an extraction angle to this? Seems like the OECD's guidelines on data processing ops are outdated...

6426 2018-05-29 14:49:40 China!...they will be the only buyers down the road.  Then they will replace existing contracts with contracts to move oil to China alone.
6427 2018-05-29 14:49:39 Lest we forget...Aunty Ngozi told us in 2014 that Nigeria wasnt able to sell many cargoes of crude oil even then at $80 because US made strategic decisions on energy independence...South Africa, Egypt and Angola have had their fair share

6433 2018-05-29 14:49:14 All about the economics. Right now the Permian has some of the most profitable acreage in the Lower 48. A carbon tax may drop it a bit compared to gassier plays but still more economical than deepwater, oil sands, etc.

6436 2018-05-29 14:49:02 The oil and gas companies are the only one's who are trying to hold us back, renewables have already proven themselves.
6437 2018-05-29 14:49:00 There is no such thing as 'orange neroli' and it's advisable to let your oil blend sits a few weeks before actually wearing it... But I can't even write few coherent paragraphs so... Just a sore loser here... 
6438 2018-05-29 14:48:58 Canadian pensions are now tied to the future of tar sand oil sales .....I YI YI ......
6439 2018-05-29 14:48:55 I don’t get how people can be mad at Tesla for not being able to master electric vehicles just yet. Where’s your anger at towards BP. Exxon. Texaco. Chevron. OPEC. All these oil tycoons who’ve made enough money for 10 generations should be putting more money into R&D
6440 2018-05-29 14:48:53 @Twitter please stop giving me ads of oil companies. I'm not Abramovich.
6441 2018-05-29 14:48:52 I need to go get an oil change after class

6447 2018-05-29 14:48:27 Just 100 Ltrs of oil in a spill is approximately 1/2 bath tub of oil.
Really not worth talking about.
The Greens are loosing credibility!

6453 2018-05-29 14:47:44 Now we can’t complain that interests of a Texas oil giant are taking precedent over the rights of British Columbians, right? 
Smart move, @JustinTrudeau . 
Very smooth. 
Except we know you’re a liar who betrayed trust of millions who voted for decency. 
Your days are numbered.
6454 2018-05-29 14:47:34 This picture makes it looks like the ingredients were pretzels, oregano, pepper, olive oil and garlic and it made me giggle

6461 2018-05-29 14:47:12 Having driven foreign investment out of Canada and fumbled their constitutional role, the Trudeau Liberal Government is now forced back into the oil business; sinking tens of $Billions into nationalizing a project that had been privately financed and shovel ready #cdnpoli #ableg

6464 2018-05-29 14:47:03 Of course, the optics of #Canada's military mowing down #Indigenous people and allies for an American Oil firm just wouldn't do. Purchasing the #KinderMorganPipeline kinda fixes that little problem for @JustinTrudeau. Lets see how this #wreckonciliation goes down. #Cdnpoli
6465 2018-05-29 14:46:49 How is this a good investment for Canadians @JustinTrudeau when you are on the record stating that you want to phase out Canada’s oil sands?
6466 2018-05-29 14:46:47 I read As I see it: the autobiography of J. Paul Getty and looked at the wealth he amassed in oil biz compared to the $$$ Zuckerberg has amassed and came away feeling Zuck does not deserve the billions for what he has done compared to Getty and oil production.  #worthlessopinion
6467 2018-05-29 14:46:44 I dunno. Soaking the mound of twenties in oil and dumping it near people's homes, in sensitive habitats and in national parks would be my preferred option
6468 2018-05-29 14:46:43 Very bad decision. No-one will want this oil and you gave our money to a foreign corporation. You will pay for it. #trudeaudemission

6483 2018-05-29 14:45:41 I still say that the pipeline isnt going to get built. We can wait and see, but the #Liberals brain trust made it clear they wanted oil left in the ground.
6484 2018-05-29 14:45:23 No it’s only 12 billion required to control the Alberta economy. Liberals can shut down pipeline. Even without shutting it down who will invest in oil sands now with uncertainty over delivery. Ideology over logic. Time to separate.
6485 2018-05-29 14:45:16 Could it be oil?

6487 2018-05-29 14:45:05 Well what I find most irritating is folks saying its regulators that are at fault when over decades, big multinationals grease the wheels so regulators are looking the other way when the next crisis occurs (opiates, finance, offshore oil drilling).
6488 2018-05-29 14:45:05 Woke up this morning to discover I am an oil baron. Mixed emotions, honestly

6492 2018-05-29 14:44:55 There is no THC in CBD oil.  That is ridiculous.
6493 2018-05-29 14:44:54 The price of oil goes up at 9am and the cost of fuel goes up at 10am yet when the price of oil goes down it takes months for the price of fuel to go down everyone from the oil company's to the tax man are all to blame
6494 2018-05-29 14:44:49 This will be a costly fiasco; the government needs to uphold the laws and stay the hell out of the oil business. This fiasco and failure belongs to Trudeau!
6495 2018-05-29 14:44:48 True... but so is also the reality that we must get our oil to tidewater for export. Without that, we are guaranteed to go bankrupt in 2 generations; at least this gives us a chance to avert that...
6496 2018-05-29 14:44:47 Overbought oil longs in a panic to support the narrative

6500 2018-05-29 14:44:24 Economy & race matters.Obama won because the white vote was split & the economy was bad. Pain at the pump will transfer to the polling booth so Prez Trump should address the issue now before it triggers a recession. Muchelle,Oprah could win if high oil prices tanks the economy
6501 2018-05-29 14:44:22 No idea. Just was driving by. Saw and took picture. And drove ahead as I didnot want to clog the road or be injured if the oil tank blasted.
6502 2018-05-29 14:44:20 That doesn’t change the fact that when oil prices go up, Russia benefits greatly. Cause & effect. Quid pro quo. You helped me get elected, I help you with your economy. 45 would have lifted the sanctions had Congress not codified them and forced 45 to sign them into law.
6503 2018-05-29 14:44:15 Coconut oil literally works for everything.
6504 2018-05-29 14:44:08 The government just nationalized the transportation of oil in Canada and #CTVnews is arguing about Starbucks in a foreign country. This country in beyond broken.
6505 2018-05-29 14:44:07 KM civil servants will cause it to loose billions. It will be cheaper to move oil by rail. Remember pacific 66/petro communist and true dope senior. After loosing billions it was given away.
6506 2018-05-29 14:44:02 Trains and trucks transporting oil also have risks. At least pipelines are monitored and localized. And battery creation for solar/wind isn’t a clean technology either.

6508 2018-05-29 14:43:55 @liberal_party @JustinTrudeau I voted for, and supported you, but that’s all gone with this #pipeline fiasco. So much promise squandered away for oil. Will we never learn? So, disappointing. #cdnpoli #allthesame
6509 2018-05-29 14:43:49 Have to ask, what would be the motivation for Russia wanting trump to win? He has levied at least three rounds of agressive sanctions against Russia targeting their oil and gas companies along with financial institutions. Putin has expelled nearly 800 U.S. diplomats as well.
6510 2018-05-29 14:43:47 Yes, the oil and gas companies only care about profit and nothing els.
6511 2018-05-29 14:43:45 I’m attacking your arguments not you. “Placating big oil” “bailing out Alberta” are just overused cliches & not analysis. If you’re against this purchase explain why. Financial reasons?Possible oil spill? Indigenous (some of who support it)? Govt shouldn’t be in private sector...

6515 2018-05-29 14:43:36 Fantastic!! The only good thing to come out of the Liberals. For once I'd have to say CONGRATULATIONS. We no longer have to ship crude oil by rail service which is neither safe or dependable!!
6516 2018-05-29 14:43:35 Nope, that's business as usual.  Royalties have been reduced, and we still have that small issue called a climate crisis.  We need real climate leadership, not oil industry memes about why the still need to exist.

6521 2018-05-29 14:43:12 Not this issue!
Oil is the issue. As long as Saudis have oil, and rest of world wants it, Saudis will do as they please
6522 2018-05-29 14:43:10 I am not a dude. Big oil is sunsetting and why the NATIONAL strategy is 2-pronged. I share your criticisms but see no counter strategy or detailed policy possible that is in our national interest at this point in time. Step out of the weeds "dude". We would all welcome one.
6523 2018-05-29 14:43:07 The government stepping in to buy the #KinderMorgan pipeline isn't a win for us that want our oil getting to tidewater. It's a sign that doing business in Canada is virtually impossible. The cost of doing business here is crushing.

6525 2018-05-29 14:43:04 The left is upset with other center-left about environmental issues and leaving tax payers the bill, which seems right, but then the right is upset with the left, nationalizing private enterprise, to get a project for oil which seems right, but for a left.

One of very few smart decisions of @Bill_Morneau & @JustinTrudeau actually
6528 2018-05-29 14:42:54 If you want your pipelines so badly, @JustinTrudeau, ask Washington to go through their backyard. We don’t want it in BC! Oil is NOT the future. #cdnpoli #TransMountain

6538 2018-05-29 14:42:18 We do right now. Do you not agree with all of the world's scientists that say we need to transition away from oil right now in order to avoid really catastrophic climate change?  We need to transition away, not lock ourselves into huge expansion projects.
6539 2018-05-29 14:42:16 A few years ago, my cat had cancer.  Guy mentions cannabis oil, I was desperate so said "ok, will try", then he comes out with "I can SELL some to you £200".

Cannabis oil is just snake oil sold by scum preying on the desperate.  

I didn't buy it BTW...

6544 2018-05-29 14:41:32 Only an amateur writer would let their character drink acceptable coffee. A true storyteller knows that coffee's gotta be "lukewarm" or "tepid" or "swirling with oil stains on the surface." Come on. Everyone knows this.
6545 2018-05-29 14:41:27 Saudi Arabia is a good example of what happens, if the wealth progression is far more quick (through oil) then cultural progression. Not 100 years ago, these people were riding camels on the desert in a total tribal culture.

6572 2018-05-29 14:40:01 Actually increasing oilsands is part of my solution. Let's push higher GHG out of the market and use the revenue to fund our transition to renewables. Putting oil profits in the hands of dictators won't help the energy transition.
6573 2018-05-29 14:39:50 @livia_ar   Very helpful recycling article in the nyt.  you might want to look into Space Based Solar Power and Waste To Energy.  Big oil squashes these but they could save us a lot of pain.

6580 2018-05-29 14:39:27 because the liberals need to find a way to give big business money directly

If they sell this pipeline for more than $100m I'll be legitimately surprised. free 4.4bn for the oil companies
6581 2018-05-29 14:39:21 The way my luck turns I will loose even on water or oil, not just crypto. If I buy 50K oil barells, the price will surely drop.
6582 2018-05-29 14:39:15 Let’s spend $4.5 billion to build a pipeline that could destroy our BC coastal waters if there’s a spill, so that we can try to sell dirty oil to a country that can get it cheaper, cleaner, & in higher volumes from Texas #TransMountain #therichtexansrlaughingallthewaytothebank

6600 2018-05-29 14:37:54 Alright people, I need to get my oil changed and want to do it near my office during lunch. Best (cheap) place to get it done in Oakland/Shadyside Area and go. And no crappy place that's gonna do it in 5 minutes and say it's done.
6601 2018-05-29 14:37:53 The same goes for about 5 other counties who's main export is oil. Not just Russia.
6602 2018-05-29 14:37:48 I don't love the look of a government buying an oil pipeline. However, given that BC wanted to run obstruction until Kinder Morgan ran out of money and gave up, I'm not clear what the alternatives were if you're supportive of the project. BC doesn't seem to want to negotiate.
6603 2018-05-29 14:37:47 Your government approved the Cold Lake tar sand expansion. When will you inform yourself about what Alberta "oil kings" are doing?

6606 2018-05-29 14:37:21 I'd argue that human psychology is exactly the same now as it was hundreds of years ago. Snake oil salesmen promising instant results weren't exactly uncommon.

The difference is we've gotten to the point where we can do it with minimal discomfort.

6608 2018-05-29 14:37:11 At the end of the day, a government that absolutely hates Alberta and the oil & gas industry with a passion now controls the infrastructure of that industry in that province. If Albertans think things are bad now, just wait, you ain't seen nothing yet.

6625 2018-05-29 14:35:46 So they can’t risk their profits, but they can risk leaking a lot of oil into the wilderness. It’s not like pipelines have a stellar reliability record. Maybe the companies should put some R&D money into stoping leaks. Then people wouldn’t hate them so much.

6627 2018-05-29 14:35:36 Economically we can’t go cold turkey on oil, however there should not be emphasis on oil job growth as clean NRG is the future.
6628 2018-05-29 14:35:35 Can't wait to go home and give myself a scalp massage with my oil mix. Honestly a stress reliever. Just wish I didn't have to do it myself lol.
6629 2018-05-29 14:35:34 FUP announced a strike in the oil sector, but UGT already said they don't want to be part of the crisis, only the solution. Talk about being a doormat!

6635 2018-05-29 14:35:22 This type of heavy crude is in high demand all over the world as it maximizes throughput of plants designed to handle high sulphur feedstock.  Worlds largest USA gulf plants particularly want it to blend with light oil.
6636 2018-05-29 14:35:12 How many pipelines did your party get built that took oil to tidewater while the PC’s were in power?

6644 2018-05-29 14:34:41 The reason for that is we can't get our oil to tidewater. If we can export our oil to countries other than the US, we can get a better price for it. See how that works?
6645 2018-05-29 14:34:40 Washed my scalp this morning with ACV mixed with water, rosemary/peppermint/lavender/eucalyptus oil. My scalp loves me!!
6646 2018-05-29 14:34:38 so what do you suggest we do, not export oil, hang a out of business sign? then what

6653 2018-05-29 14:33:45 @aycawe when are we having a conversation about the Oil industry in S.A.? It's a fascinating space with growth potential that's not being harnessed. There's a lot to talk about here.
6654 2018-05-29 14:33:44 It would get even more expensive for you if India wasn’t buying our Oil. Because investors would stop paying to bring it up from the ground.
6655 2018-05-29 14:33:39 Too much secrecy in oil and gas sector. All four refineries not operating at optimal capacity for more than 30 years...no new ones yet gulping billions....still not fully operational. No questions are asked, why?

6669 2018-05-29 14:32:57 Morneau Sucker, read Tyeee the price for tarsands oil will go down not up. You just saved a bankrupt American company with taxpayers money.
6670 2018-05-29 14:32:52 I dun think in oil you go to a supplier and spend 2 weeks trying to drag the price down by a couple of thousand. The supplier would just get pissed and sell to a less stubborn and cheapskate company. Marina is just being stupid.
6671 2018-05-29 14:32:48 But is it the coconut oil itself doing that ??? like what if you swapped it would ur skin know

6674 2018-05-29 14:32:43 I can see it now. Feds build a pipeline but ensures a single barrel of oil doesn’t flow through it. There, everybody is happy! #totalfail
6675 2018-05-29 14:32:35 Braces are too expensive so getting a second opinion and went for an oil change for my car and found out my tire is really unsafe to be driving on it. This is what I get for not sleeping in until my regular noon alarm

6679 2018-05-29 14:32:22 I’m opposed to all pipelines, and oil in general. It’s a short term gain for a very long term loss.

6681 2018-05-29 14:32:11 I guess the liberals are prepared for retirement. Who throws $4,500,000,000 of taxpayer money at a controversial pipeline at a time when we're more certain than  ever that the world is moving away from oil. Whose votes are they buying? Feels like it's the Liberals who are bought.
6682 2018-05-29 14:32:10 Drinking organic coconut oil was a good decision one of the best decisions I made in a while 
6683 2018-05-29 14:32:03 $4.5 billion could have eliminated child and native poverty in this country. It could have done a lot of things. Instead the literally-filthy-rich oil industry is propped up for a little while longer.
6684 2018-05-29 14:31:46 no doubt it will pinch; it will bite and bite hard. but iran will continue selling its oil, and likely muddle through without collapse

6688 2018-05-29 14:31:28 Good morning! Everyone ready to cough up for that #pipeline we don’t want? 

Thanks, @liberal_party

Why on earth would we want proper drinking water for First Nations, or pharmacare or child care when we can have a WHOLE BUNCH OF OIL INSTEAD???

6690 2018-05-29 14:31:25 This decision will haunt Trudeau government. This of us who knocked on doors for him will not forget that he took billions of dollars from Canadian families to buy out an oil pipeline that violates indigenous rights & our commitments in climate change.  #cdnpoli #bcpoli #stopkm
6691 2018-05-29 14:31:25 You never got an oil change? 
6692 2018-05-29 14:31:20 Best do it before the oil really does run out and the country collapses after crashing out of the EU (assuming there isn’t some last-minute “doing the day job” on the part of MPs)!

6701 2018-05-29 14:30:44 I never want to hear a word out of conservatives again about the federal government not doing anything in return for Alberta’s “generous” equalization payments, after the feds literally bailed out a US oil company for the direct benefit of Alberta #ableg
6702 2018-05-29 14:30:43 There’s a lot of reasons on both sides for this pipeline. I was fairly anti-KMP until I really looked into the financials, and we lose a BUTT-TON of money piping the oil into the US, which then pipes it back up to B.C. anyway.
6703 2018-05-29 14:30:41 Lol ok block me mate. I don't care. I'm a vet- your tweet implied it was a memorial day sale with 15% off. So you bet i tweeted that. And then threatens to block me-- like i care. Go sell your snake oil bro

6705 2018-05-29 14:30:34 & I know it likely won’t happen because capitalism  but one day Alberta will run out of oil and then what? If we start working now it won’t be an issue. Invest in wind and (in summer) solar energy as well as in oil and diversify Canada’s energy investments.

Ended up costing $241.
6718 2018-05-29 14:29:38 As someone who was born and raised in BC I have nothing but love.  However, this pipeline is the only way to be competitive with our oil reserves and it has to be built!  I am so glad this will move finally move forward.

6720 2018-05-29 14:29:31 I could not be more disgusted with the New-Trudeau government. Spending 4.5B to placate a giant oil corporation and force another pipeline (and who knows what the actual cost will be). I had better not ever hear another Albertan talk shit about equalization payments.
6721 2018-05-29 14:29:30 Oil prices are tied to GOP-SANCTIONED PRICE MANIPULATION, plain and simple.
6722 2018-05-29 14:29:17 It is oil.  Lots of money in that.  If they made money from the auto sector bailout they can make even more in this!

6724 2018-05-29 14:29:10 #Trudeau's #pipeline approach is odd. On the one hand, he doesn't want to tick off #environmentalists who hate Canadian #oil. On the other hand, he's decided to be a better builder of #pipelines than Harper. The result? A $4.5 billion state takeover of #TransMountain. #cdnpoli
6725 2018-05-29 14:29:07 For a supposedly forward looking government this is shockingly backwards. We are going to protect our climate by building more oil pipelines? #cdnpoli #stopkm

6735 2018-05-29 14:28:30 It reduces the likelihood of an oil spill in both the Salish Sea and along our rivers by moving the resource in the safest means possible. A resource that will still need to be moved if our society is to continue to function
6736 2018-05-29 14:28:28 I understand the oil is a necessary evil and there isn’t much we can do to stop this from happening, despite our efforts. However I would also love to see more green initiatives to help offset oil usage in Canada. I know wind power won’t fuel cars.
6737 2018-05-29 14:28:15 I hope not an airbrake and more an)(oil &) gas pedal.

6740 2018-05-29 14:28:00 So you're saying to hell with Burnaby, how they feel is unimportant and if they lose their economy so be it. They don't matter at all. Oil is all that's is important to you.
6741 2018-05-29 14:27:59 The oil in my car has been well ravished
6742 2018-05-29 14:27:57 No this is worse. No Alberta must rely on Ottawa to send oil to the BC coast. The Liberals can also change their mind based on ideology and just shut the pipeline down. No one will invest in oil and gas in Canada now. No certainty of delivery. Liberals have screwed the west,

6761 2018-05-29 14:26:04 @benshapiro Now why would Japan bust China for breaking the North Korean oil embargo? I looked up which way the winds would usually blow a nuclear cloud off the Korean Peninsula. The winds are usually in Beijing's favor, so Trump would have to bide his time to spare Tokyo.
6762 2018-05-29 14:25:57 Totally disgusted by @JustinTrudeau to put the profits of a tiny few oil billionaires over the rights of our native people and the futures of all Canadians. These companies deliberately caused global warming and tried to hide the evidence, they should be paying us all for damage
6763 2018-05-29 14:25:54 Well what kind of oil  did you use? Brent, crude, tea tree? Well I used to support indy but if it means people using palm oil willy nilly, I'll stick with the cruel merciless tories at Westminster.
6764 2018-05-29 14:25:48 The government is doing what they need to do. Do you really expect all that oil to just be left in the ground when there is a strong worldwide market for it? Until that market goes away, pump it, ship it, sell it and prosper.
6765 2018-05-29 14:25:44 Stupidly are nuggs fresh outta the oil and not drained properly. My gut hates me right now so damn much!
6766 2018-05-29 14:25:22 Try an aspirin pill or tree tea oil!

6770 2018-05-29 14:25:12 I haven’t oiled my scalp in a while and it’s been itchy just I just did w a mix of castor and tea tree oil and the itch went away almost immediately. I bet it was just dry af but I’d like to think it was the tea tree oil

6777 2018-05-29 14:24:45 you can use vegetable oil - 3/4 as much oil as you would have used butter...
6778 2018-05-29 14:24:44 It is pretty ridiculous how difficult it is to get Canadian oil to tidewater
6779 2018-05-29 14:24:35 question which goes abegging -what results have we to show to reduce "import of oil"
6780 2018-05-29 14:24:24 Why is getting an oil change always a challenge lmao
6781 2018-05-29 14:24:24 I don't think that your work is the first time!
I think that is a very wonderful expression.
If you give a little advice, please try using OIL and Red Burn of Weathering Master D-set.
Then paint the back side of the armor with a dark color.
That way, the work tightens.

6783 2018-05-29 14:24:11 Right now the oil reaches the west coast by train which has a much higher risk of spilling than a pipeline. Oil will still be shipped along BC coast (Alaska) whether you like it or not, so we might as well make it safer and more profitable with a pipeline.
6784 2018-05-29 14:24:06 えっ、いや、べ。別に〜！、
6785 2018-05-29 14:23:53 Every high school should have a mandatory class called “LIFE” which teaches how to: balance a checkbook, sew, change a tire and oil, do taxes, basic first aid, basic cooking etc. things that you’ll need in real life.
6786 2018-05-29 14:23:52 Now there’s a conflict! Justine’s buddy SOROS paying the protesters but Justine now having the pipeline built-guess that’s what makes the political world spin as it does! Taxpayers! You are now oil barons!!! Walk with a swagger today! Still can’t afford gas though!
6787 2018-05-29 14:23:43 I could do this I just bought some CBD oil.
6788 2018-05-29 14:23:42 people can say anything.  But India progressed tremendously under #MMS 's 10 years peacefully.  Today Modi and Amit shah takes all decisions . Even after favourable intl. oil price country is lagging. only in violence &  corruption  we r ahead.
6789 2018-05-29 14:23:41 Up 15-17% unrealized on the new oil short positions in $DWT. Going to see how this week goes to make decisions on profit taking or whether to press it. Nice moves in $WTI here

6791 2018-05-29 14:23:39 Agreed. Its snake oil. Its a racket. 

These programs make the employees annoyed, resulting in more jokes and disrespect to the whole situation. Which they then use to sell more anti-bias training.

There are race profiteers who're making billions by stirring up racism
6792 2018-05-29 14:23:38 Can we just not with this pipeline? Lets be a country that pulled out of oil gracefully and instead of hanging on tooth and nail until the bitter end.
6793 2018-05-29 14:23:37 That is assuming the oil sands cap is equitable.  It is 20% of our current 2030 carbon budget.  Trudeau apparently is counting on the world not taking action to meet climate targets

6802 2018-05-29 14:23:03 Renewables will replace fossil fuels when oil industry executives decide they’ve made enough profit for another yacht & have completely destroyed the environment. Engines replaced horses because they were more efficient. Facts prove renewable energy IS already more efficient.
6803 2018-05-29 14:23:02 After shutting down Northern Gateway, after it was already approved. After adding rules to Energy East mid-stream, making it unaffordable. Cabinet ministers of @JustinTrudeau are bragging about getting oil to market by nationalizing TransMountain. Unreal. #cdnpoli #tmx

Will cost me and every other Canadian $124+ I assume that the total project cost is unknown to Bill Morneau because he avoided every question on that topic. So Canadians will get a fed carbon tax to pay for an oil pipeline?wait what?
6809 2018-05-29 14:22:40 Yes, but what are mere students compared to the far more deserving charity of an Enron-derived Texas Big Oil corporation that didn't pay taxes in Canada and now grabs $4.5 billion of Canadian tax dollars and runs back to Texas? Liberal priorities.
6810 2018-05-29 14:22:22 Imagine the Bow River running full of dirty oil from it's headwaters through Calgary and further down river, and the people who put it there deflecting responsibility for the damage. It's this image and similar, which is the source of BC's "Antics". #bloodmoney

6818 2018-05-29 14:21:37 @TheRickHoweShow inevitably Cdn govt will be saddled with white elephant pipeline that nobody ever buys. Investors know in 8-10 years demand for oil will drop significantly as alternate energy takes over. #badgamble b/c no company will consider buying it until its complete #2late

6825 2018-05-29 14:21:05 “Often votes against party” = often betrays her party. Unless you’re shooting something, advancing business at all costs, regardless of the environment and human life, or you’re giving handouts to oil co’s, don’t expect the republican vote. You’re losing both sides Heidi.

6829 2018-05-29 14:20:45 I went to bed last night and it was 2018. I woke up and we are back in 1975 with the government nationalizing a major oil project again.
Never thought I would see this day again. But with another Trudeau in office we are going down the path of failure once again. #TMX
6830 2018-05-29 14:20:40 Olive oil one, yeah I tried it myself and it didn’t do what it said it would. Took too long to dry
6831 2018-05-29 14:20:39 4.5 billion going toward oil instead of renewable's, or feeding hungry, or healthcare, or daycare program.  Major step forward my ass.  This is a travesty!

6833 2018-05-29 14:20:30 Alberta oil has been a bad deal from the start. $5 a barrel and no commitment to refine it in Canada. Now this.
6834 2018-05-29 14:20:29 Tomorrow may take place in Brazil a oil tankers strikes meanwhile the scenario gets worse along the absent politicians decision.
6835 2018-05-29 14:20:27 What the actual f&$k? Just shove this down our throats why don’t you. BC doesn’t want this. We just had another oil spill. We aren’t being reimbursed for costs of past spills.  We. Don’t. Want. It.  #TransMountain #CrudeOil
6836 2018-05-29 14:20:24 I really appreciate your efforts here.  I think that reduction of land fill waste and energy efficiency are of extreme importance globally.   I wonder if you have looked into conversion of waste to energy.  Plastic is oil and can be used for generation of electricity.
6837 2018-05-29 14:20:22 a lot of the products that are recommended for use in your natural hair are unnecessary and unnecessarily expensive and time consuming. Water and olive oil spray will go a long way.

6845 2018-05-29 14:19:41 You don't speak for me.  You held the rest of Canada hostage over the climate plan.  Why should we reduce our emissions when your province is not and is giving the oil sands 20% of our 2030 carbon budget?
6846 2018-05-29 14:19:35 If oil needs to be refined to become usable as gas, how it being used to much?
6847 2018-05-29 14:19:30 This #KinderMorgan pipeline sale has made me disappointed in my country. This #oil pipeline sale is a step forward in choking out our #planet and ruining the future for ourselves and our children and for every other person, and creature that had no say.
6848 2018-05-29 14:19:29 It is tactics of all comy. Create Nukes and then ask the west to feed their people or they will build missiles, test them, scary the west.

6851 2018-05-29 14:19:14 A company like Kinder Morgan doesn't invest in a pipeline w/o knowing how costly the legal battles will be. That hasn't change. The price of oil has.

Transmountain just turned out to be a bad bet. KM, naturally, wants to shift the blame. But govt shdn't be left holding the bag.

If it werent for the fact Trump exists, I'd call him the worst leader in North America right now.
6891 2018-05-29 14:17:01 Ours is going up again massively next week, due to "rising oil prices" The utter greed is insane.
6892 2018-05-29 14:16:59 In the interest of keeping it factual, which I know you do, POTUS doesn’t really drive price of oil. It’s a global effect largely hinged on OPEC. Demand inching up as surplus as begun to dwindle. Price of a barrel is highest it’s been in several years.
6893 2018-05-29 14:16:51 This your first baby give it some time I had Ethan at 36 weeks and ej at 34weeks... use primrose oil pills it helps soften the cervix and it helps not to tear but u gotta stick it up your cooch
6894 2018-05-29 14:16:50 Want to know something about Lex Luthor? He's bald like Mr.Clean. He uses baby oil to shine his bald head.
6895 2018-05-29 14:16:46 This weekend, try oil pulling while wearing a jade bracelet.
6896 2018-05-29 14:16:44 oil clogs, please go away! HAHAHA lol
6897 2018-05-29 14:16:27 No.  Canada didn't choose oil. Mr Trudeau's phony majority government chose oil, like Mr Harper's phony majority government before it.  #CDNpoli  most Canadians have no voice in our #WinnetTakeAll system
6898 2018-05-29 14:16:27 Open your eyes then. Electric energy from the earths resonance field @ 3 to 7hz. Its been done but big oil own those patents.
6899 2018-05-29 14:16:24 OPEC just lowered oil prices...?

6902 2018-05-29 14:16:08 @MikeSmythNews @charlesadler now we own TM, is there a hidden plan to expand the pipe to Cherry Point? They only run mid 80% capacity, and pipeline oil is way cheaper than tanker oil. maybe this drops tanker traffic further.

6907 2018-05-29 14:15:29 Canadian's future pensions are now tied to the future of tar sand oil.......But Justin and Bill won't have to worry about that
6908 2018-05-29 14:15:25 20% increased crude in 2 years. And they're a net exporter. Also, they have a very high renewable in the mix and sugarcane prices are low. Mix of ethanol and gasoline will be quite cheap for internal consumption. We OTOH, import oil and sugarcane is geared to produce cheap sugar

6914 2018-05-29 14:15:03 /2 In addition a $4.5 billion investment in green energy does nothing to solve the oil transportation problem. It WILL get transported to market. Finally this present government is the most Green government ever in this country. I’m pro green but I have to be realistic.
6915 2018-05-29 14:15:02 Israel keeps getting missile’s launched at it from Iranian backed rebels. If this keeps happening Israel may attack Iran itself. This could spike oil markets or worse if a war breaks out.

6917 2018-05-29 14:14:58 Time for a face mask & oil bath.
6918 2018-05-29 14:14:56 Alberta acknowledges the need to reduce carbon emissions and is spending billions to do it. You follow an anti oilsands dogma that ignores what oil production is like in the rest of the world and illogically villifies the Oilsands.

6929 2018-05-29 14:14:19 HAHA put some oil on your chair
6930 2018-05-29 14:14:16 Sadly, this isn't true.  Oil companies with productive land are not drilling.  There is a glut of crude right now, we can't refine or store it as fast as we are getting it.  The high prices are a result of Wall Street and OPEC squeezing profit out of a turnip.
6931 2018-05-29 14:14:16 Nakakaadik yung amoy ng baby oil legit.
6932 2018-05-29 14:14:12 Ok everyone. Without the pipeline our oil is worthless. Our oil only has value if it can reach market. International oil companies won't expand in Canada without a pipeline and won't build a pipeline cause it's cheaper to expand elsewhere. If you want an oil industry support it.
6933 2018-05-29 14:14:06 You are literally a Captain Planet villain. Way to sell out your people to a foreign-owned big oil you ashen ghoul.
6934 2018-05-29 14:14:05 Cars are just basically another bank account but instead of being forced to support the horrible banking industry to make a living you are forced to support the horrible oil and gas industry
6935 2018-05-29 14:14:05 Can we turn it into a hyperloop once the oil's run dry?
6936 2018-05-29 14:13:53 For the past 50 yrs Canadian politicians have aided in hamstringing the Alberta energy industry. Karma KM suprised by carbon tax. Liberals take over p/l project the day oil drops 2.83 lol. Russia an OPEC are opening the valves. 

Federal government spending $4.5B to buy Trans Mo
6937 2018-05-29 14:13:52 How soon do you expect global oil demand to peak and decline? You seem to be counting on the world not taking action to reduce fossil fuel use enough to meet the Paris Agreement targets.

6944 2018-05-29 14:13:25 You are basing your argument on a fallacy - the options aren't by land or by rail, the 3rd option is not placating big Oil, not bailing out Alberta w fed money when they dont pay prov taxes, and respecting #IndigenoussRights, the #Environment, #climatechange, & #BCPoli

Personally I'm hoping that we are smarter.
6952 2018-05-29 14:12:42 Given that their oil-rich neighbour AbuDhabi will one day run out of oil.

6954 2018-05-29 14:12:38 The #TMX decision is an opportunity to take ownership of the carbon-intensity agenda as an #Apollo project for Canada. Consolidate innovation already occurring in the oil sands, build the narrative, drive for higher gains. #ABleg @JustinTrudeau @RachelNotley @Resource_Works

6958 2018-05-29 14:12:19 I also believe we should be supporting All of the clean BC energy companies trying to help this paradigm shift from oil.  Fuel Cell power is becoming very important all around the world because it has now become cost effective.
6959 2018-05-29 14:12:17 When you deal with morons who are happy with a level of unnecessary rights-infringement just 'cause they hate sane people, insults are appropriate.
6960 2018-05-29 14:12:11 If we don’t ship the oil to booming #Asia someone else will. Neutral to climate. Burning more dirty Chinese coal is better why?
6961 2018-05-29 14:11:58 The Emirates are wary of other ports in the region given that their Jabel Ali port makes them quite a lot of money. For Dubai, which has almost very few oil reserves, but is forward looking, weakning rival ports would strengthen their future economic position.
6962 2018-05-29 14:11:43 The UK can look at Norway & Switzerland with envy but it can't emulate them. Norway took the oil out of the ground & then put it back in the ground in the form of infrastructure plus investment in its sovereign wealth fund - that ship sailed for the UK with Thatcher.

6971 2018-05-29 14:11:21 You’re preaching to the converted! BUT cars, trucks, trains etc need oil. Canada has oil. It WILL get developed. The sole issue is how it is transported to market. By thousands of oil trucks per day (green house gases) or by a pipeline which adds no GHGs to transportation.
6972 2018-05-29 14:11:19 The dollar us rising. Rates will continue to go up. Inflation is increasing and oil follows inflation. I still see oil headed higher.

6975 2018-05-29 14:10:56 How long before Trudeau and Butts shut the pipeline down?
Cause that's what they want
That's what they've been taking about
Just imagine them trying to build a pipeline
Doesn't even come close to making sense
They want to strand and isolate the oil
They want to kill the oilsands.
6976 2018-05-29 14:10:43 Canada will spend/ buy 4.5B  for a pipeline to provide “certainty” for a Texas based company. They’ve completely ignored Indigenous land jurisdiction and Indigenous peoples FPIC  but there’s political will to bail out/ indemnify (through purchasing) a foreign oil company.

6986 2018-05-29 14:10:09 While I don’t support idea of buying it/building it, if it does go through wouldn’t it be in Canadians best interest to keep ownership of it and then Canadians can actually profit from it as much as the oil companies by controlling shipment corridors?

6990 2018-05-29 14:09:41 Mr. President, the whole Democratic Party cooperated with Moscow on the supply of gas and oil to Europe via Ukraine, This is a terrible deal !!! Hillary Clinton will have to deport to Rostov-on-Don.
6991 2018-05-29 14:09:36 kind of natural when Norway's fund is built on oil and gas don't you think?
6992 2018-05-29 14:09:29 What’s the price of oil today?
6993 2018-05-29 14:09:24 Bravo to the decision to remove uncertainty over #KMPipeline and create an asset worth billions for Canadians. 

Opening up oil access to Asia and diversifying from a monopoly US consumer vital for WTI-WCS differential. 

It is hugely beneficial to Alberta and Canada’s tax ..

7006 2018-05-29 14:08:36 You were told Energy East has nothing to do with this. The fact that Asia will go elsewhere for oil is irrelevant to shipping oil from Westridge. That trains don’t travel to Asia to justify this pipeline. You’ve never said why YOU want to ship oil to Asia for $.
7007 2018-05-29 14:08:33 Yet he wants oil rigs off the Atlantic coast- with the exception of his “investment” state. Stunning how people don’t see through him.

7016 2018-05-29 14:07:23 K.M.pipeline is not economically viable due to decreasing price for oil. Pipeline violates laws of common sense when we even speak of increasing shipments of heaviest oil imaginable to combust into planetary atmosphere at  time of tragically severe weather events.

7017 2018-05-29 14:07:21 Come on, we've seen this as Trudeau and Butts plan the entire time. State control of vital resources is opposite of a marketplace. National Energy Program aka NEP2; gets worse from here on in. #Oil
7018 2018-05-29 14:07:07 Gah damn this the longest oil change ive ever experienced in my days of adulting
7019 2018-05-29 14:07:07 CCS doesn't count? Tar sands (pejorative). You call Alberta information propoganda and take China's statements at face value. Dying industry, look at IEA world oil consumption estimates?   You ignore where the oil will come from if not Canada (dictatorships). Rational?

7025 2018-05-29 14:06:17 bcs the less you pay on the car loan leaves more for other consumption, higher oil, higher health care, higher rents/housing, etc. There is some merit for many to a longer loan term for the lower monthly payment although it costs more in the end on the interest rate payment
7026 2018-05-29 14:06:08 I'm not one of those who blame any form of government.
I actually think Venezuela actually allowed too much foreign influence into politics.
What happened to them was more than just oil.
Internal politics and lack of a clear standard for power change like China is a problem.
7027 2018-05-29 14:06:08 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
7028 2018-05-29 14:05:59 Think about what a $4.5bil investment in renewable energies and retraining current oil workers in new technologies could do instead of investing in outdated infrastructure that will be obsolete within 20 years.
7029 2018-05-29 14:05:59 Don't be so naive to think they are forced to do anything. This is a plan to control oil output from #Alberta .

7034 2018-05-29 14:05:31 oh you know just our "left" government literally buying oil pipelines to make sure they get built
7035 2018-05-29 14:05:27 Neh 13:5  And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded to be given to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters...
7036 2018-05-29 14:05:13 Even a snake oil salesman can dupe some people to buy his bogus product. But eventually they see that they’re not getting better and he is chased out of town. 

The time of reckoning is coming. It will not be pleasant for you.
7037 2018-05-29 14:05:12 I personally don't give a damn if it's built or not. But I will say, we are an oil producing nation, and we need to get our resources to market somehow. Like it or not.... it's who we are. We can mitigate environmental impacts and make sales at the same time.

7042 2018-05-29 14:04:33 A majority of Canada maybe, they don’t care what happens to our food supply or coastline, their opinion is meaningless. Anything else to add? Can we come spill oil in your backyard?

7062 2018-05-29 14:03:11 Thanks for article. I use @NaturesUltra CBD Oil. Works for me. #CBDOilUser
7063 2018-05-29 14:03:05 Im in the oil industry and I can tell you this is a horrible idea. Costs can spiral out of control even if you know what you are doing. Only bright side of this is that this might be what it takes to get rid of the Liberals and that is the only good rhing that will come out of it
7064 2018-05-29 14:03:01 I do not look me in a tablespoon of olive oil is a mess and I'm proud.
7065 2018-05-29 14:02:59 Why on earth do we put oil while cooking pasta when oil and water don't even mix.
7066 2018-05-29 14:02:58 I’ve been buying avocado oil mayo since at least 2010, I’m glad it’s trendy! I have options now  you can also get it at Aldi these days.

7068 2018-05-29 14:02:47 The people against the oil sands will hate this.

The people for the oil sands hate this.

No one wants the govt to own a pipeline, it's not 1979!

Worse it's likely a play for Ottawa to permanetely control the oilsands, which is why they are not doing the obvious
#kindermorgan
7069 2018-05-29 14:02:46 Now, let’s increase the pipeline between KM and Cherry Point.  It’s way cheaper to get oil via pipe and Alberta then Alaska via tanker, plus decreases tanker traffic. Plus plus Cherry Point only runs mid 80% because they can’t get enough oil.  Hmmm hidden agenda?
7070 2018-05-29 14:02:43 do you know how many grads and kids with buckets it would take to get oil from Alberta to the coast of BC using that method?

7073 2018-05-29 14:02:27 Canada's federal government said Tuesday it is buying a controversial pipeline from the Alberta oil sands to the Pacific Coast to ensure it gets built.
7074 2018-05-29 14:02:26 If there's one thing to splurge on, it's olive oil.
7075 2018-05-29 14:02:22 That is good. “Regular” palm oil is a killer; once you start looking at ingredients lists of things you realize it’s in nearly EVERYTHING and very hard to avoid
7076 2018-05-29 14:02:16 Little coconut oil..
7077 2018-05-29 14:02:14 You should be ashamed of yourself. The oil industry is a century-long con. $4.5 billion could transform our green energy sector, but instead you prop up this racket yet again.

7082 2018-05-29 14:02:01 Neh 13:11  Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place. 
Neh 13:12  Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries.
7083 2018-05-29 14:01:56 with that so called tax break i guess big oil and china are trying to get a bang for that buck. i hope everyone who said more money in your wallet is waking up now
7084 2018-05-29 14:01:52 Met a gem in North Bay that wouldn’t let me leave town until he fixed the lights and changed the oil on my car.

7087 2018-05-29 14:01:34 Yikes. This article makes me happy/relieved I have chosen @NaturesUltra CBD Oil which uses only the highest quality ingredients.

7088 2018-05-29 14:01:31 So now the government can ship in foreign oil to the west coast now with this so called plan thus destroying Western Canada. Kinder Morgan needs to step up and reject this crap @AndrewScheer @jkenney @MichelleRempel Do you part and axe this bullshit
7089 2018-05-29 14:01:30 Some girls don’t know how lucky they are to have bushy natural eyebrows, trying to grow mine out with the coconut oil method and no success
7090 2018-05-29 14:01:28 It doesn't get said often, but doubling US oil production in the last several years has changed our stature and ability to negotiate in the Middle East, making us safer. A quiet hats' off to drillers, too.
7091 2018-05-29 14:01:16 The other major problem is that oil isn't "equitably" distributed, iirc.
7092 2018-05-29 14:01:15 You can't have a climate change plan that doesn't recognize we're dependant on burning oil for the next few decades at least. That's just wishful thinking, not a plan.
7093 2018-05-29 14:01:15 I dont see motherfuckers crying bout the shit Chinese they brag about their oppression, but wait no oil there oppression is
7094 2018-05-29 14:01:09 Cheap cooking oil + pole = no squirrels or chipmunks while hilarity ensues.
7095 2018-05-29 14:01:00 The article misses the big picture by assuming all dilbit, I'm saying light oil growth will replace the dilbit over time - find a few more articles, there is other information out there.  Also watch the fed govt news conference this morning.
7096 2018-05-29 14:01:00 Is there something called an artificial sea ports also, or oil refinery or even investors what do they have to sell even countries standing for a long time have major challenges talk more of one planing to start from scratch

7102 2018-05-29 14:00:40 Also my mom insists on buying shampoo with tea tree oil and I’m allergic to it so it makes me hair super fucking itchy, dry and causes dandruff
7103 2018-05-29 14:00:40 Moron...Low gas prices were primarily caused by US Shale Oil companies who are able to provide Oil/gas for cheaper and caused an over supply of oil which caused gas prices to drop. Prices are up due to OPEC agreeing to cut supply which in turn increases demand and prices..#read.
7104 2018-05-29 14:00:39 People are being fed a line about hypothetical millions being lost each day, which is a misleading simplification (and particularly when the original plan wouldn't have seen oil flow through until end of 2019 anyway). Unfortunately, many politicians are part of the campaign.
7105 2018-05-29 14:00:27 When im done eating my avo with sugar, i then make a paste with the remainder (coconut and grapeseed oil included) ndova ndazora kumeso maoko nemakumbo and take a nap whilst moisturization takes place. 
7106 2018-05-29 14:00:26 I so much love my countrymen
 Nigeria was in recession in 2008 during oil boom @ $140/barrel but the country is bouyant and her economy mismanaged now when a barrel is now between $35-$80. Issokay now.
7107 2018-05-29 14:00:24 Don’t worry about cost. Just calculate how much it will save. Multiply flow of oil x discount in Canadian oil , it comes in $Billions not millions per year.

7113 2018-05-29 13:59:35 If you did own an oil processing plant, it would actually need to be overseas too, since the pipeline is useless for selling oil domestically.
7114 2018-05-29 13:59:32 Do we have a state run oil transport company right now? Lol, what a time to be alive.

7118 2018-05-29 13:59:12 Obviously that includes Gas & Oil...
7119 2018-05-29 13:59:07 Yeah, light oil from the Middle East, which they are flooding onto market. This pipeline is worthless. Kinder Morgan knew that.
7120 2018-05-29 13:59:06 waterboard them using crude oil.

7129 2018-05-29 13:58:14 This is the final nail in the coffin of the #tmx. It will never be built. Also, a government that absolutely hates Alberta and the oil & gas industry with a passion now controls the infrastructure of that industry in that province.If Albertans think things are bad now, just wait.
7130 2018-05-29 13:58:11 Told my nan that people have predicted that we will run out of oil by 2052 and she said it was the Russians scaremongering us 
7131 2018-05-29 13:58:03 Canada's federal government said Tuesday it is buying a controversial pipeline from the Alberta oil sands to the Pacific Coast to ensure it gets built.
7132 2018-05-29 13:58:02 Bro when you say EVERY form I don’t think people understand.

7133 2018-05-29 13:57:57 So now pipelines give off green house gases (GHG)? What’s the alternative? Run thousands of trucks a day or truck/rail the oil which gives off huge amounts of GHGs? Sadly all countries need oil for economies to run. This oil will get shipped one way or another.

7137 2018-05-29 13:57:46 The sell off in oil is over done IMO. Bought more $CRC July 20 $42 calls at $1.30. Average cost now $2.60, will be looking to exit at a small profit and buy later dated calls to offset risk. Bullish on oil and CRC, but this market is losing it over the OPEC news (or noise**).

7141 2018-05-29 13:57:24 This does not demonstrate Calgary/Alberta is a healthy place to invest.

Oil companies set up shop in Calgary, government offices go to Edmonton. 

If the government builds this pipeline it will be a longterm multi-faceted disaster for Calgary.

7144 2018-05-29 13:57:16 @JustinTrudeau investing in oil at a time when it is being fazed out is like buying acne medicine and cream when you have grown out of your teens !! (0_-) You just throw it away years later because you never use it #BuySolar

7149 2018-05-29 13:56:40 Transmission pipelines are the biggest revenue generator in the oil & gas industry. They make money no matter what the price of oil. By regulating away all the competition, the feds seem to be trying to take over that market. I pray they fail.
7150 2018-05-29 13:56:38 My vote will be to oust Climate Change denier @repmimiwalters of Orange County, for her numerous votes protecting the oil and gas industry, for her $55K that she took from 2017-2018 alone. I'm voting for @katieporteroc #CA45 #bluewave
7151 2018-05-29 13:56:37 This tweet is beneath you. Consider the huge subsidies Harper gave to oil companies. You have a huge intellect. Use it.
7152 2018-05-29 13:56:36 @CBCNews the first promise was not to build a pipeline to get oil to port. The first promise was not build anymore #climateleadersdontbuildpipelines #stopKM #seperateoilandstate
7153 2018-05-29 13:56:28 There's no money for clean water/housing on Canadian reserves, no money to fix railway to Churchill, but @JustinTrudeau can find $4.5B to piss away on a pipeline for Texas oil company whose stock just shot up 8% thanks to his gift to KinderMorgan at taxpayers expense.
7154 2018-05-29 13:56:27 Interesting to see $XLE holding up well with the market down and oil down.  This could be a good signal.

Tories will RIGHTLY be furious b/c there's no way we should be on the financial hook for this, and the climate cult SJW's will be furious b/c Trudeau has forced them all into partial ownership of an oil pipeline. #LittleDickTator effed up HUGE! #cdnpoli

7162 2018-05-29 13:55:50 Ou forgot the money that is made when we can sell the oil at fair market prices. We will get it back.

7164 2018-05-29 13:55:39 Bogus justification that it will assure investors in Canadian megaprojects. They know the risks. 

Now, in order to sell the project, Canadians will be forced to cover ALL liability when an oil spill happens. First billion of damages may need to be discounted in sale to market.
7165 2018-05-29 13:55:29 Nice article. I use @NaturesUltra CBD Oil. Works for me.
7166 2018-05-29 13:55:23 So...it looks like #KinderMorgan can invest in expanding the pipeline to Anacortes now that Canada bought Trans Mountain.  Canada just paid to ship more oil to the United States.
7167 2018-05-29 13:55:21 That’s cute. Do you not remember Harper buying out GM? Or muzzling climate scientists? It’s possible to care for the environment and still acknowledge we need Oil. I understand your outrage but there had to be compromise and that compromise was the carbon tax.
7168 2018-05-29 13:55:13 Every time you say “rigged” it reminds me of an oil well. How’s that price per gallon working out? Might want to use a different word.

7175 2018-05-29 13:54:24 Canada's climate change policy was always a fraud. You can have the oil sands or you can have a credible climate plan. You can't have both and Canada chose oil.
7176 2018-05-29 13:54:21 Don’t worry about cost. Just calculate how much it will save. Multiply flow of oil x discount. It comes in $ billions not millions.  BC is exporting highest coal , it’s not environment but #BC is doing politics.
7177 2018-05-29 13:54:15 How does this government put its citizens last in this transaction? Do tell. The alternative is running a few thousand trucks a day with oil or shipping it by truck and rail which is just silly from an environmental point of view.

7184 2018-05-29 13:54:02 Yeah the government using tax dollars to take over a project from a company that specializes in this business is a great idea. Nationalizing (socializing) the oil sector like Venezuela is a great plan is you want to eat your pets. This country is fed with great thinkers like you.
7185 2018-05-29 13:54:00 Or the money it makes taxpayers when we can get a fair price for the oil
7186 2018-05-29 13:53:58 So I went to get an oil change and when I was going to pay the guy told me that my dad had come in earlier and paid for it  my dad is the best 
7187 2018-05-29 13:53:58 So tragic.

Perhaps most of all because there is just a "doubling down" on the #1 CAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE (i.e., Natural Gas extraction) by the GOP on account of their COLLUSION with the Oil & Gas industry. 

Such a recklessly negligent policy turns the Palsgraf case on its head.

7192 2018-05-29 13:53:47 Conventional oil change? What even is that?
7193 2018-05-29 13:53:41 Yes, you can undermine economies of countries who also sell oil and DEPEND on higher prices. You can then flood the market for whatever reason along with your allies. Normal people are stupid. They just see oil prices as good president/bad president. The REALITY is much bigger.
7194 2018-05-29 13:53:38 A dollar backed by oil. One of the first things Trump did was clean out Saudi Arabia. At that time, he negotiated to put Saudi oil on the stock exchange. Economists said that move made it near impossible to crash the dollar!

Just renegotiated a China deal.
Lowered taxes on companies to bring back jobs to the US. Started drilling for oil and started up coal. Which hurts the oil producing countries and Russia. Kicked Russians out of country.
7198 2018-05-29 13:53:16 You own an oil processing plant?  Awesome.  You can be the first to sign up a contract for it.  China won't commit for more than a couple of years worth of product.

7210 2018-05-29 13:52:24 And this is another fair point, but the question of how long the new pipeline will/should last still applies. As we shift away from oil to electricity (generated by hydro, solar, and wind), this new line will also be redundant.

7272 2018-05-29 13:46:56 @JustinTrudeau @PamDamoff WHY ARE WE INVESTING IN OIL PIPELINES IN THE YEAR 2018? There is no way the project can brake even before the planet reaches dangerous warming levels #StopKM why not invest in green energy huh? #seperateoilandstate
7273 2018-05-29 13:46:55 Who’s gonna get first dibs on the oil and where can we bury the migrants 
7274 2018-05-29 13:46:51 Not sure how this is fair to a bettor. Cle is +550 and GSW is -900. Why the huge discrepancy? Why even bet? #BoDog #NotLineOfTheDay
7275 2018-05-29 13:46:51 I want to move forward w new energy opportunities. But Canada still has an oil based economy. We can transition to green energy. You cant kill our existing economy. I applaud @JustinTrudeau @liberal_party decision to buy KM. Now let's move our product to countries other than USA.
7276 2018-05-29 13:46:46 अरे ये नीच है नीच
7277 2018-05-29 13:46:42 Gettin this oil change got me fucked up! It’s free but still
7278 2018-05-29 13:46:42 POTUS got someone from your state freed from bondage what have you done besides oil down your hair
7279 2018-05-29 13:46:41 Oh...Japanese Maikosan
7280 2018-05-29 13:46:39 US Opening prices: #DOW -0.84% #NASDAQ -0.45% #Ftse100 -1.21% #GBPUSD 1.3271 #EURGBP 0.8723 #EURUSD 1.1577 #Gold -0.61% #Oil -1.22%
7281 2018-05-29 13:46:37 We always forget about your expertise in economics and the oil industry
7282 2018-05-29 13:46:37 It was only a little oil leak in Kamloops 
7283 2018-05-29 13:46:34 Wasn't the oil platform in second game? Controlled by Enclave and that faction did not appear in first game.

But that's not actually a bad idea, perhaps taking place in time before Enclave took over it? And you could still have land sections while majority takes place at sea.
7284 2018-05-29 13:46:21 Yes its can block sbb foundation kan ada contain oil kan for the texture. So make sure cuci muka betul2. Boleh la start buat double cleansing
7285 2018-05-29 13:46:19 Who would you vote for instead? The NDP? Handing the election to the Cons who are even more pro Oil? That’s some awful logic.
7286 2018-05-29 13:46:17 there are still First Nations law suits? -- this is a bail out for a texas oil company - brutal  #stopKM
7287 2018-05-29 13:46:14 I dont listen to anything $GS says anymore BUT it really makes NO sense for the Saudi's to want lower #oil LONG term. Not sure why they agreed with #russia right now. 

Either way, this is still all a "MIGHT increase" not a "will". 

$xop $uso. $xle
7288 2018-05-29 13:46:13 I do use weed, at the beginning of the month, for as long as it lasts. I'm also looking into CBD oil. I'll have to look up Goat Yoga. If I can do it laying down, I'm all for it. Thanks!
7289 2018-05-29 13:46:11 Would you rather prefer your shimmer body oil in...
7290 2018-05-29 13:45:29 Fossil fuel for fossilised brains
Tarsands oil for retarded economies
Pipelines for Pied Pipers
7291 2018-05-29 13:45:23 Just put tanning oil I'll either tan or burn.. fingers crossed for the tan
7292 2018-05-29 13:45:13 So are you saying SNP did not mislead us over oil before the referendum.
Why do you not respect the majority vote was to remain in UK.
Why is it anyone that disagrees with you lot they are all idiots.
7293 2018-05-29 13:45:13 Justin has started the phasing out of our oil. He buys a pipeline that has no builder, no agreement from BC and things are worse then ever before. Canada needed a govt that takes leadership not throw money at the problem. Just like daddy destroying the west economy
7294 2018-05-29 13:45:12 "The good news is that if every U.S. citizen ate just one meal a week composed entirely of locally and organically raised produce and grass-fed meats, eggs or dairy, we could reduce our country’s oil consumption by over 1.1 million barrels of oil—every week."
7295 2018-05-29 13:45:04 I cut up apples to eat while Charlie and I wait to have my oil changed. I literally ate two slices (after she has already been eating them) leaving one more slice. This girl looks at me saying ONE MORE!? YOU ATE ALL OF THEM!?
7296 2018-05-29 13:44:58 To my understanding, not with CBD oil
7297 2018-05-29 13:44:48 But oil prices were low during Obama's second term.
7298 2018-05-29 13:44:46 เอพิ้งค์วันนี้ยังพอมีความเคลื่อนไหวกัน
กำลังจะเงียบหายไปอีกละเหรอ

7300 2018-05-29 13:44:31 vegetable oil as well!!!!!!!
7301 2018-05-29 13:44:12 I don’t need to be here 1.5 hours just to get an oil change 
7302 2018-05-29 13:44:09 Feds spend $4.5 billion to support pollution.  We will never get that money back. Libs/Trudeau will wear this for a long time.  Oil industry laughing all the way to bank. #stopkm #KinderMorganPipeline #cdnpoli
7303 2018-05-29 13:44:07 Oh sure. But there’s going to be a lot of stunned Albertans when this pipeline doesn’t end up the rainbow with a pot of gold at the end of it. Oil is never going back up to $100 a barrel. Alberta needs to accept that.
7304 2018-05-29 13:44:03 I’m no war expert but I believe America has been in the Middle East too long...and for what? Oil? Human capital? To help allies? If we stayed out of the Middle East, how would things fair out? I hate the bombing, the killing of families and greediness for land and oil. Hate it.
7305 2018-05-29 13:43:58 I made this french onion soup yesterday and substituted the vegetable oil for hot belly bacon grease. Probably the best french onion soup I've had in years. Thanks for sharing
7306 2018-05-29 13:43:58 Women love waiting till the last minute to get oil changes lol.
7307 2018-05-29 13:43:57 My poor car was asking for help , it only had 5 percent oil
7308 2018-05-29 13:43:52 Liberals just spent $4.5 billion of public funds to bail out a Texas oil company.
Yet they couldn't find:
-$3B/yr to adequately fund healthcare.
-$3.1B to ensure clean drinking water for First Nations
-$1B/yr for universal child care

What else? 
#KinderMorgan
7309 2018-05-29 13:43:45 Sape2 yg lalu kat tweet saya ni, nak tanyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.
Tea tree oil tu untuk jerawat je ke????
7310 2018-05-29 13:43:39 I disagree. This is a great investment for Canada. You should read more from @politicalham. Oil demand isn’t going to flatline just cause Canada decides not to build a pipeline.
7311 2018-05-29 13:43:29 i'm not sure but they said bio oil & vitamin c serum might help :)
7312 2018-05-29 13:43:25 SO have you pulled the trigger on Oil Short?  Confused from 5/26 tweet
7313 2018-05-29 13:43:23 You think this is one project? You think it’s all about Oil and not other agriculture commodities. Just watch what transpires from this decision, mark my words.
7314 2018-05-29 13:43:04 its an oil beetle
7315 2018-05-29 13:42:55 Why wait till you’re back on the ground???
7316 2018-05-29 13:42:54 Sir ,this time oil win the race. Seriously think about it.
7317 2018-05-29 13:42:46 Get's one mile to the gallon of whale oil
7318 2018-05-29 13:42:40 Today is the first time in the history of man that I took my car to get an oil change and the mechanic didn’t try to roast me
7319 2018-05-29 13:42:38 The world is moving away from oil, this pipeline is going to leak and we’re going to be on the hook to clean it up, and the opposition is only going to get worse now. Why would anyone want to own this pipeline? KM obviously doesn’t think it’s profitable.
7320 2018-05-29 13:42:38 I wanted to go get an oil change but I’m probably not gone have time.
7321 2018-05-29 13:42:33 語彙力がｗｗ((･▿･ 三  ･▿･))！！！
7322 2018-05-29 13:42:30 A long as I can change the oil in my car, take out the garbage and unclog drains the patriarchy is alive and well. Get this- My wife frequently submits to my cooking and stands aside as I do the dishes.  muahaha

7325 2018-05-29 13:42:26 My basement is an old basement, & you choke on the smell of peppermint oil. Lol
7326 2018-05-29 13:42:17 *asking about oil change prices*
Hey is this stiffy lube?
7327 2018-05-29 13:42:17 You misspelled God-Emperor. ;)
7328 2018-05-29 13:42:12 They are not. KM Canada will still own some crude by rail and oil storage facilities and a couple much smaller pipelines. They are selling their core asset for sure but not *all* their assets.
7329 2018-05-29 13:42:09 はい。
7330 2018-05-29 13:42:08 And what happens if trump decides to say he won't take our oil? Then what
7331 2018-05-29 13:42:04 Trudeaus and oil policy. That takes me back.

7335 2018-05-29 13:41:41 When @JustinTrudeau promised in 2015 to end subsidies to the oil and gas industries, it dawn on me that he meant nationalizing them.
7336 2018-05-29 13:41:39 Know a lot about economics and trade do you. If we could increase trade to the EU nothing is stopping us doing it now. As for Oil, it's not Scotland's in UK waters.
7337 2018-05-29 13:41:38 I need to change my oil.. still 
7338 2018-05-29 13:41:30 IOW the article seems to be saying, "sell your home to a global investment group, & move into a rental you won't be able to afford, so we can make Britain into a pirate derelict oil rig?"
7339 2018-05-29 13:41:30 Too many other reasons apart from investment. They never cared about sanctions, their oil production had gone down from 2 mil barrel to a mere 400k a day. You believe what you want to.
7340 2018-05-29 13:41:29 はいｗｗｗ
7341 2018-05-29 13:41:28 Can't believe Stephen Harper is bailing out another oil company by outright buying an oil pipeline #smh #cdnpoli #sunnyways
7342 2018-05-29 13:41:17 The LPS technology has been used for 2 years by a customer for indoor inspections in the Oil & Gas industry! It is into business :-)

7345 2018-05-29 13:41:08 Wrong nation had corrupted our alphabet agencies & senate. Think lots of oil money. You will see in June. The NSA files are very telling. Prove what the military high ups told Trump they needed help cleaning out. Stopping the corruption. Nothing Russian that I’ve heard.<FalseFlag
7346 2018-05-29 13:40:59 Some specifics aside, I tend to be pretty “let the baby have its bottle” on pipelines as oil drifts into modest priced irrelevance but almost everybody’s actions on the build it side of this fucking debate is so irritating and stupid.

7351 2018-05-29 13:40:26 PERSONAL REQUEST
I have finished writing my slides. I have finished writing my speaking notes. I would prefer it if there was no new oil market news for the rest of the week so I do not have to revise them (again). 
Perhaps someone could convey this request to OPEC+

7353 2018-05-29 13:40:23 > Canada needs illegal oil pipelines

Yeah, we’re going to need to see a citation, Rob.
7354 2018-05-29 13:40:22 Ever since the day I tweeted about needing aloe vera for my skin, I have been using it every single day and night  since! My skin is looking great! And I also use grapeseed oil for a moisturizer instead of any lotions. Coconut oil works good too
7355 2018-05-29 13:40:21 This new lemon citrus honey scrub soooooo fire !! Includes tea tree oil and rose water   , helps w/ dark spot correcting  Release date :May 30th , will be premiered later today !
7356 2018-05-29 13:40:21 I only use a leave-in and a styler for my hair, and only apply an oil when I'm taking down twists or if I dab a little on the end of a twist. The key is that the products need good moisturizing properties. Oyin Handmade is a favorite, and Miche Beauty is pretty clutch.
7357 2018-05-29 13:40:21 From Sept 2013 to Jan 2016, crude oil price went down from 110$/barrel to 30$/barrel.
In 2016, it was under 40$/barrel. In 2017, it was under 60$/barrel.
But we, citizens, were not given profit.
Because Modi govt increased Central tax by 105%.

7358 2018-05-29 13:40:21 Endless oil story
7359 2018-05-29 13:40:15 Wouldn't fancy having to oil that decking. 
7360 2018-05-29 13:40:14 12 million
The number of barrels of oil a day that Saudi Arabia can produce. The U.S. may produce more than ever, but SA holds the strings: it can react more quickly to oil prices—which in May reached highest level since 2014— than any private company from Texas to North Dakota.
7361 2018-05-29 13:40:06 “Expensive”? The opportunity cost of solar+storage vs coal,oil, gas or nuclear...?
7362 2018-05-29 13:40:04 Yikes! One has to wonder since analysts are predicting significant drops in oil pricing as global transportation is electrified this next 2 decades.
7363 2018-05-29 13:40:03 Η Motor Oil διαπραγματεύεται στα 17,22 ευρώ με απώλειες 4,33% όγκο 162 χιλ. τεμάχια και αποτίμηση 1,9 δισ. ευρώ
7364 2018-05-29 13:40:03 You know, we should have been nationalizing the oil industry all along while predominantly foreign capital got rich off Canadian resources.  This was the CCF-NDP's view. Nationalizing an unprofitable Trans Mountain line is merely corporate subsidization #cdnpoli

7367 2018-05-29 13:39:58 Make Canada like Venezuela!   Nationalize the oil industry and break it.
7368 2018-05-29 13:39:57 To all those complaining about the cost of today’s big pipeline purchase: Transmountain is profitable business. The line is a valuable asset. Oil companies are paying tolls every day to ship down the existing pipe. This is an INVESTMENT that will generate returns, not a subsidy.
7369 2018-05-29 13:39:51 We'd run out of all the good milks, so I thought I'd try butter and coconut oil coffee for the first time and bloody hell! I now renounce all the milks #milkshun

7374 2018-05-29 13:39:20 @Bill_Morneau You have just sold out Canadians for corporate interests. Destroying the environment for corporate profits. Oil is not the future, it's the past. Liberals just blew their chance at re-election, just handed it to the Conservatives.
7375 2018-05-29 13:39:13 You do realize fields shut down as oil prices drop? As oil prices rise, they re-open..?
7376 2018-05-29 13:39:10 Speculators do and I'm grateful. I don't have time to study world oil markets everyday to determine what a gallon of gasoline should cost.
7377 2018-05-29 13:39:10 Mr. President before November elections & preferable this ‘Driving’ ‘Summer’ season release some oil from Strategic Oil Reserves; just enough to get America’s attention & drive down gas Prices Thur Summer driving / vacation season. Think November 
7378 2018-05-29 13:39:01 Maybe we will. Maybe we won't. 

Canada isn't going to stop producing oil any time soon.
7379 2018-05-29 13:39:00 Little bit of oil and that wheel will start spinning
7380 2018-05-29 13:38:56 そりゃびっくりはんだろ
7381 2018-05-29 13:38:51 That is complete horseshit.

The next generation will demand that we build a coffin for the Oil and Gas industry and we already have - made out of solar panels 

Once this current governing generation retires or dies, so will oil and gas.
7382 2018-05-29 13:38:42 Oil is tricky, many sources, a lot of politics, supply/demand,etc.
7383 2018-05-29 13:38:41 Great!  They deserve you. Can’t wait to not go to her next movie.
7384 2018-05-29 13:38:36 Smh..I am talking about this present transfer market 

It seems you guys will spend more

It does not matter where the money comes from either from player sales or other revenues the club generates or it is from oil money

You spent money that's the main thing
7385 2018-05-29 13:38:34 You have too much oil in your engine. What could this cause?
7386 2018-05-29 13:38:28 Let’s put this simply: someone, somewhere, promised some oil company a pipeline without consulting anyone and then had to bailout when people were pissed. Go figure.
7387 2018-05-29 13:38:24 Today's Kinder Morgan announcement puts @JustinTrudeau directly into the oil business, but it also means this government has the power to stop this project in it's tracks. It's our job to convince them to do that.
7388 2018-05-29 13:38:21 I'm wondering what country to move to when the country's financial house of cards crumbles. It's a very bad time to double down on oil.

7391 2018-05-29 13:38:03 Higher gas prices are good if we are producing most of our oil needs and not because OPEC is dictating the price.  Sign of a strong economy and Texas doing very well
7392 2018-05-29 13:38:02 Know what else makes us let dependent on foreign oil? Renewables.
7393 2018-05-29 13:37:57 Morning Blog 5/29

Everything you need to know and more about italy, spain, oil, fang, and rumors too.
7394 2018-05-29 13:37:57 The $4.5B does not include pipeline construction.  KM had the project at over $7B so this deal really is more than $11.5B but ultimately the Liberals will now control Alberta’s oil export market to tidewater.  #pipelinewoes
7395 2018-05-29 13:37:51 こまくんまじドン引きだわ
7396 2018-05-29 13:37:38 The common touch.
7397 2018-05-29 13:37:38 Koch Oil funds McConnell, Ryan, Rand, Rubio, Cotton, Cruz, and others of their ilk.
7398 2018-05-29 13:37:36 If memory serve me right they sold cheap barely a few years before oil price went way up... Figure this is going to happen they build the pipeline and sell it back cheap just before oil goes back way up. Follow the money that usually where the corruption is.
7399 2018-05-29 13:37:31 Thank David Hogg for that. That pipsqueak got me to join the NRA.

7404 2018-05-29 13:37:18 Any press do the numbers on how much oil is passing through the existing pipeline and what that rent income will be going forward?

7406 2018-05-29 13:36:53 So in a couple of decades, Rachel Notley Junior will apologize for spoiling Pacific waters and the Rockies (feeding fires) with the dirtiest oil?

7408 2018-05-29 13:36:32 Political dynasties based on nationalizing oil projects ...

Discuss.
7409 2018-05-29 13:36:29 Canada should now buy a few oil refineries to add value to our bitumen.

7412 2018-05-29 13:36:19 The they won't build the pipeline narrative is dead, and the we want to nationalize the Oil industry instead argument can't stand so I guess they can fallback on legitimate concerns for once?  Risk mitigation?
7413 2018-05-29 13:36:19 What should set off people is his reckless foreign policy and warmongering. The end of the nuke deal with Iran probably drove up oil prices some too. I hope cooler heads around the world prevail because all we have is hotheads.
7414 2018-05-29 13:36:15 When gas prices rise, domestic oil companies make more money allowing them to expand and drill more.  This in turn makes us less dependent upon foreign oil which improves GDP.

If gas prices rise too high too fast, they kill the goose that laid the golden egg. Moderation is key.
7415 2018-05-29 13:36:13 Nigeria can never be one. Gowon himself acknowledged this when he said that "there is no basis for Unity in Nigeria" until he discovered Oil & Gas in Biafraland.
7416 2018-05-29 13:36:05 Russia’s main export is oil. When oil prices go up, they win.
7417 2018-05-29 13:35:42 Clearly this was the libs plan all along. Why would these oil elites invest their own billions when you can just penetrate the Canadian government, and rig it so the tax payers take the hit. Follow the money!

7421 2018-05-29 13:35:28 Wonder how many places we just dropped on places to invest in the oil and gas industry?
7422 2018-05-29 13:35:18 we could if big lobbies got out of the way. we also still have tons of oil but need to stop using it. its choking us. Good for you for looking for bee info! Can I ask where you heard that were running out of oil??

7425 2018-05-29 13:35:06 Breaking news this morning: The federal gov't has agreed to buy the troubled Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project from Kinder Morgan to ensure AB oil gets thru BC. What do you think? Good? Bad?

~@DarrelDaniels
7426 2018-05-29 13:35:06 Neil, his followers are not his employees. The morality that you seek is not controlled. A group of people can easily "consider" themselves Elon Fanbois and target someone, to make an argument against Elon. These are people that throw oil in fire, are we responsible for that?
7427 2018-05-29 13:35:03 You just skip from issue to issue with every good reason I’ve provided not to go ahead with this. It’s as though you’re reading right out of the same pro oil play book that all the pro oil bots are reading from. Why is this project in YOUR interest?
7428 2018-05-29 13:35:00 Guess I just got into the oil business. Does that make me rich? When can I expect to start seeing the cheques?
7429 2018-05-29 13:34:52 Share with her whatever the blessings you get from using the oil. You are on your own tho.
7430 2018-05-29 13:34:50 This intrigues me. Nothing locks in govt support for AB oil better than their owning an $8B piece of infrastructure that depends on it.

But, the govt controlling the pipeline allows for political games to make oil flow volatile. Hurts investor confidence...

7434 2018-05-29 13:34:29 Made the mistake of putting coconut oil in my hair because I was rushing to work and it was dry af. When I arrived to work my co worker asked if I was hot because I appeared to be sweating but it was the oil was running down my forehead and I hadn’t noticed .
7435 2018-05-29 13:34:28 You need to get your oil checked

7440 2018-05-29 13:33:55 Grape seed oil mixed with a bit of tea tree oil. Also @PixiBeautyPH has some gooooood toner that helped mine.
7441 2018-05-29 13:33:54 Temporary jobs that will disappear once it’s built. PS: Vancouver still hasn’t been reimbursed for oil spill clean up from three years ago, that’s BCs concern. You say they’re on the line to pay for a spill but history says otherwise.
7442 2018-05-29 13:33:54 If this country needs oil to be self-sufficient, why do we need to get it to tide water so it can be shipped away, instead of refining it at or near the well-head for domestic use? More long-term Canadian jobs would be created, as well. cc: @CBCEarlyEdition
7443 2018-05-29 13:33:44 aye true words. The sooner we are done with oil the better, and by we I mean humanity collectively.

7448 2018-05-29 13:33:14 I remember in 2002 oil was $22 ish a bbl and diffs were $4.50. Upgraders were struggling but lots of pipeline space so future looked bright (no Bakken oil in sight) peak oil predictions were 2020 so Oilsands was they big play.
7449 2018-05-29 13:33:10 If the #TransMountain pipeline is a project in the national strategic interest (I’m not convinced it is but I’m not an oil expert) then the government building it probably is the best path forward. This wouldn’t be questioned for a large highway or hydro project so why this?
7450 2018-05-29 13:33:08 snake oil > hemp oil
7451 2018-05-29 13:33:07 A fair point but MLK was fighting for civil rights and Gandhi was for independence. This is a difference on environmental policy. May even said that she just prefer the oil be refined in Canada and then moved, as opposed to moving raw product.

7453 2018-05-29 13:32:57 Work told me to take the truck to the shop for an oil change so that’s what I’m doing. Getting paid to wait for an oil change this is great lol
7454 2018-05-29 13:32:49 Now you’re selling this because life involves risk? Tell this to the marine creatures that would be wiped out in the event of a fire or a spill! 

All this, to sell oil to Asia? Nonsense! Avoid the inevitable risk and let’s NOT do this!

7464 2018-05-29 13:31:44 Good observation. BTW this perfectly applies to US- USSR cold war !
It was cold war (thanks 2 nukes !!) but as 1960s came ,the more open and diversified US+NATO had the decisive edge. Oil shock temporarily boosted USSR but that bonus vanished by mid 80s. Then came Gorbachev !
7465 2018-05-29 13:31:36 I’m having avo & olive oil on toast for bfast today.

7469 2018-05-29 13:31:11 Lost yourself the next election in the process.  Investment in green energy is always a better idea than spending billions on a pipeline full of dirty oil no one wants.
7470 2018-05-29 13:31:07 Even if Tom speaks, he will make it look obligatory on India's part & dump the timely help given by GoI, worst he would curse govt towing vaticans line.

7471 2018-05-29 13:30:50 I’m literally dying. 

This weekend I was cutting jalapeños and the oil MADE MY HANDS BURN. 

This morning I was rushing to get ready and I threw APPLE CIDER VINEGAR IN MY EYE.

7472 2018-05-29 13:30:50 Today I became part owner of a 4.5 billion dollars oil pipeline project... FML! Kinder Morgan is laughing all the way to the bank.
7473 2018-05-29 13:30:49 @Kinder_Morgan can’t build the pipeline across provincial borders .. @liberal_party buys the current pipeline .. finishes the FEDERAL PROJECT .. sells the pipeline back to an oil company (?KM?) #Shenanigans

7482 2018-05-29 13:29:46 If your diet is lacking certain vitamins, then by all means take them. However this obsession with taking crazy snake oil pills is a shame and dangerous.
7483 2018-05-29 13:29:46 Si tan solo pudieran comprender un poco del contexto, verían que el paro de caminoneros en Brasil por la suba del gas oil, nada tiene que ver con Macri.
7484 2018-05-29 13:29:45 Well there we go Canada we're in the oil business. So who decides, who gets to ship oil fairly in your new purchase? Is it by pay to play the regular socialist style, by that I mean who puts the most into Liberal coffers.
7485 2018-05-29 13:29:42 Oil demand is growing. Canada can either benefit from it or others will.
7486 2018-05-29 13:29:42 exactly. 

also my theory is that the driving reputation is mostly because yankees and rednecks mix like oil and water, and cause like 90% of the wrecks, especially during shitty weather
7487 2018-05-29 13:29:41 Liberals purchased Trans Mtn from Kinder Morgan for $4.5B including existing lines and right of way.  The project is now “Federal” jurisdiction.   Transaction completes in 3rd or 4th Q. Still no construction deal, it limits AB’s influence over our our oil exports and KM gone
7488 2018-05-29 13:29:41 Buy the tea tree oil by itself. Wash your face then put it over the spot.
7489 2018-05-29 13:29:37 @JustinTrudeau you have lost all credibility as a progressive environmentalist.  Under your watch, Canada has now become more of a #petrostate than it ever was under Harper. Your legacy is now tied to a dying #oil industry. You have lost the trust of Canadians #cndpoli #stopkm
7490 2018-05-29 13:29:36 Next on @KRDONewsRadio @GoodmanJord "America's Money Answer Man", we will be talking about rising interest rates and oil prices and what impact it could have on investments.

7495 2018-05-29 13:29:04 Some key points on #TransMountain purchase:
$4.5B / pipeline should be in private sector, will move back to private sector after construction and indemnify future investors of political interference / oil companies will pay to use pipeline.

7497 2018-05-29 13:28:45 Don't forget OPEC. Maybe we really need to reduce the amount of oil we buy from them. We certainly have plenty HERE!
7498 2018-05-29 13:28:38 Thought spreads in 2015/16 were like $10 (although oil was 40ish) & Canadian refineries margins were tight ? 2017 they blew out to $28ish when oil was 60ish which made upgrades $$$. Heavy oil producers margins became very tight. If you own upstream &downstream assets all good ?

7503 2018-05-29 13:28:09 ... if you're willing to spend that much, why don't we build a few reimfineries in Alberta and sell that oil to ourselves? Even if not fully nationalized a little would go a long way.

7510 2018-05-29 13:27:33 Federal Liberal purchase of #KinderMorgan perpetuates the petrodollar which artificially raises the price of exports from manufacturing provinces.

Manufacturing rebounded because of decline in the price of oil & industry is beginning to thrive. Jobs losses may outnumber gains!

7516 2018-05-29 13:26:42 Content and concentration are important in chemical discussion. Waste water is 99.9% water and degradable material; crude oil is >99.9 hydrocarbon. See solution dilution: Oil spill area will be excavated, treated off-site, and then dispersed over a large area.
7517 2018-05-29 13:26:37 The Canadian oil sands are not dirty,  unlike the American tar sands that are.
7518 2018-05-29 13:26:34 .. this is a sad day for Canada's transport industry and the communities who prosper from the trickle-down economics associated with oil transport such-as fuel, mechanical services, food, accommodation and their trick-down merchants. Not to mention the loss tax revenues of such.
7519 2018-05-29 13:26:32 They are banking on two things: 1. Assumption that crude oil price will ease out soon 2. There is no big election in near future. The adverse political impact, if any, will die down by the time next big election comes.

7525 2018-05-29 13:25:50 Meanwhile gas prices will keep going up with no end in sight. The only pipeline that should be built is to a refinery, then the gas station. Keep Canadian oil in Canada.
7526 2018-05-29 13:25:50 In the Nation’s economic interest and for thousands of jobs in the tar sands! Those are the ONLY reasons @Bill_Morneau and @jimcarr_wpg are giving for going against BC, against FN’s to transform Vancouver into a major oil shipping port! #bcpoli #cdnpoli #vanpoli

7538 2018-05-29 13:24:26 I totally support the high taxes... I hope it touches 100 rs to a litre. The high taxes help clear the loans to iran for the oil and also building infrastructure

7543 2018-05-29 13:24:16 Aah eish ..so I should save up & try & buy a couple of things bcos I'm really trying to go "natural" where my face regiment is concerned ... @Dischem has "Aromatherapy rosehip oil" is that the same as Rosehip seed oil? Can I buy that so long?

7548 2018-05-29 13:24:00 I’ve been using peppermint essential oil in the mornings to help wake me up. It’s bomb 
7549 2018-05-29 13:23:49 Maybe it is time to re-consider the Energy East pipeline so Atlantic Canadians no longer have to pay a premium for oil products. Much safer than shipping oil by rail.
7550 2018-05-29 13:23:45 #TuesdayThoughts did you know that Trinidad and Tobago has the highest carbon emissions per capita in the region? Carbon Dioxide Enhanced Oil Recovery (CO2EOR) can help reduce these emissions through carbon capture and storage #CERMTT
7551 2018-05-29 13:23:40 Oh...the WORLD needs their oil. And trust me, the Saudis USE that to THEIR advantage. #FreeTheTruth. Saudis fund & spread hate-filled ideology that fuels jihadists black hearts & reign of terror.

7554 2018-05-29 13:23:10 Morneau reminds reporters of pipeline tolls oil firms pay. Since Canada now owns existing Trans Mountain line, oil firms will start paying tolls to Ottawa… right away?

7556 2018-05-29 13:23:06 I know why I crave sushi so much. Fish oil is good for depression. O

7560 2018-05-29 13:22:39 Don't worry, America is looking for oil to liberate your people. Seriously, your human rights abuses are just stacking up. Saudi Arabia looks tame compared to you.

7565 2018-05-29 13:22:23 I think and have always thought that Trump is no better than the snake oil salesman he was on TV. If the Special Counsel finds he committed a crime, yes, I'd want him held accountable. As I would with anyone who commits a crime regardless of their party. Next please.

7569 2018-05-29 13:21:59 Yep. That’s capitalism for you. In the US, healthcare is a business industry just like oil & gas or automobile manufacturing. We humans are commodities and the “parts” we need are also.

Just nit at the same time
7575 2018-05-29 13:21:39 Thats because they want us to use oil so they want to bash the only guy making a change not just for environment but for us.

7580 2018-05-29 13:21:16 You’re just surfing from issue to issue looking to justify this. What possible reason would YOU support this? The press conference that the Lib’s are doing now the only reasons they give are for jobs, male dominated oil patch jobs over jobs for men and women in B.C. Tourism!
7581 2018-05-29 13:21:15 Congrats, Conservatives. You got the Canadian oil sector nationalized. Because that's what you wanted, right? #HaveYourCakeEatItToo

7591 2018-05-29 13:20:31 Crude oil price on 18 May:71.28$/barrel,on 25 May:67.88$/barrel.
Still petrol price . In Delhi it touched an all time high of 78.43/lit,& in Mumbai it rose to 86.24.
Previous record in Delhi was Rs 76.06/lit in Sept 2013. That time crude oil price was 110$/b
Now only 67.88$/b.

7601 2018-05-29 13:19:45 Working got a small tax break, just like Bush, Big oil got my tax break in rising gas prices and over charging economy. Like Budweiser telling Big Oil to take a hike by purchasing hydrogen truck.

7604 2018-05-29 13:19:35 From April, most petrochemicals have seen a price rise of 4-18%; so, have polymers, the raw material for plastic goods. Increase in crude oil prices have led to a sharp rise in its derivative petrochemicals, plastic-making raw material polymers and feedstock like Naphtha.
7605 2018-05-29 13:19:31 ““When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face,”

7606 2018-05-29 13:19:29 Actually, CO2 is essential to life.
But please, for us "morons", can you provide an example of what can replace oil? I'll wait.
7607 2018-05-29 13:19:28 @potus  just about all the money I am getting because of the tax cuts is going to the Oil Companies.  It seems the closer we get to being self sufficient the higher the price for gas

7609 2018-05-29 13:19:18 Trump supporters were crowing last year about expanded oil & gas production, which was going to drive down prices and hurt Russia (thus supposedly proving that Trump is hostile to Putin). How's that working out?

Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj said India will abide by UN sanctions but will not necessarily follow unilateral ones  imposed by the United States against countries such as Iran. Iran is the third-largest exporter of oil to India.
7624 2018-05-29 13:18:06 Nervous traders are bidding up the price of oil. This has nothing to do with supply and demand. It happens every year. It is just uninformed speculation.
7625 2018-05-29 13:18:03 We will have to get more for our oil !
7626 2018-05-29 13:18:02 Royal Bank of Scotland says it will no longer provide financing for oil sands projects or new coal fired power stations, thermal coal mines or arctic oil projects.

7636 2018-05-29 13:17:27 China #PFY prices remained stable to lower this morning. As crude oil and PTA futures both dropped, market participants held heavy wait-and-see stance now. Under such background, local #PFY prices in Jiangsu and Zhejiang were stable to lower, with discounts available.

7664 2018-05-29 13:14:39 That's probably right. I just wonder whether that top row will largely disappear in the future. Owning a car is actually pretty inconvenient! I think many would gladly use a self-driving car to go on both short and long trips and skip oil changes, maintenance, repairs, etc.

7669 2018-05-29 13:14:26 It could very well get to 100-120...but only if US stocks rise as it does IMO.  If we get US equities (& oil) down w/rising USD (like today), the runway is likely far shorter than that.  At 150% of GDP, the US stock mkt now IS the economy for all intents & purposes.
7670 2018-05-29 13:14:24 Cannabis oil, if given after the doctors give up, can still save a lot of lives. We have seen it first hand many times. Losing hope is a certain death sentence. Giving hope where there is none is exactly what we focus on.

7943 2018-05-29 12:46:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, however they go out fast.
7944 2018-05-29 12:46:04 LOL its win win for America now...if they pump more the price of energy goes down ans spurs our economy...if the pump less the price of oil goes up and increases tax revenue for american oil companies making profit ..because now WE are major players in the energy sector
7945 2018-05-29 12:46:00 @MarkConnollyCBC They said we were going to get off the oil rollercoaster. But here we were again.
7946 2018-05-29 12:45:52 Use this rule: “if it comes in a box, don’t eat it.”  I’d have eggs and black coffee for breakfast. Throw some chicken or other meat in with the eggs and spinach.  Not egg whites; you need the healthy fats from egg yolk. I even throw in some avocado oil and hot sauce for flavor

8075 2018-05-29 12:30:56 U need to add mustard oil to this- and then add a bit of flavoured salt - that’s how Kaafal is eaten best
8076 2018-05-29 12:30:55 I thought having the pipeline was supposed to make us independent of foreign oil? Last I heard we were exporting some oil. Let's keep it at home and lower prices? #MAGA @realDonaldTrump
8077 2018-05-29 12:30:52 Security votes,  oil subsidy... Simple but complex
8078 2018-05-29 12:30:46 Mix 2 1/2 pints grits with 1/3 cup jambalaya. Adorn with  Olive Oil. Allow to harden Serve in 3 inch slices
8079 2018-05-29 12:30:35 World oil demand is on track to hit 100M barrels/day late this year or early next. I musta missed that in your article
8080 2018-05-29 12:30:34 I went to brunch and laid around ALL DAY yesterday Im driving to work today and realized I forgot to get an oil change 
8081 2018-05-29 12:30:21 おじや的な何かーーーーーーｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗ
8082 2018-05-29 12:30:20 will sluggish growth become the norm for Houston post Harvey? probably not as long as oil prices keep going up...
8083 2018-05-29 12:30:20 things i need:

strawberries, bananas and avacado for my smoothies.  

avacado oil and concealer.

8085 2018-05-29 12:30:06 I feel very fortunate to have grown up there before oil was discovered. It was a wonder-filled time. It is still exceptionally lovely, & oil $ has increased accessibility to many areas. Bugs are only bad for a short time. Go in August!
8086 2018-05-29 12:29:58 Getting oil changed in my Jetta. Ask my mechanic his thoughts on the Tiguan and Countryman in terms of maintenance etc. He says, “we don’t get a lot of those here. Those are Eastsider cars”. 
I guess I’m officially an Eastsider 
8087 2018-05-29 12:29:58 Its a new day....if OPEC wants to drive the prices up it will only put money in American oil companies pockets.....
8088 2018-05-29 12:29:58 I got oil wax shatter allat shit but nothing beats rollin up in in the mornings
8089 2018-05-29 12:29:52 This is not a Kremlin oil story???? LOL?
8090 2018-05-29 12:29:50 Lol good, it depends on the skin type if it’s oily you already have an overactive sebaceous gland, the oil in peanuts will increase sebum production, oily skin attracts more dirt which then lead to breakouts
8091 2018-05-29 12:29:40 That happens to me sometimes when I travel too!! I know nothing rly makes it go away but I’ve found peppermint oil/ peppermint candies help 
8092 2018-05-29 12:29:38 I actually need to come through lol. But I’m bouta leave the gym & get an oil change so Ima hit you
8093 2018-05-29 12:29:26 Had the experience twice, once here at home and once with friends, parafine/-oil above selfcombustion, burns, stop burning with a cover, remove the cover and again it burns. You can only remove the cover under selfcombustion temp. Cooled the pot in a pan water. Then ok.
8094 2018-05-29 12:29:20 Everyone selling you oil cartridges is probably ripping you off right now, because they sell for the dub fuck what you heard.
8095 2018-05-29 12:29:20 Gov: I just can't work out why people like this get support.
Me: Might be the people you kill for oil n the orphans you leave to be radicalised. Example: Syrian soldier, he has a son, a daughter, now left with ISIS and months later let in the country to kill people. Stupid or?!?!
8096 2018-05-29 12:29:00 Not all Trump's fault - Gotta lay some of the blame on state taxes and the oil companies. Suppliers don't HAVE to raise prices because it's summer, now do they?
8097 2018-05-29 12:28:55 Watch to see if oil goes back down just in time for mid-term election. He has help from others who control these prices.
8098 2018-05-29 12:28:54 Data is the new Oil...the most sought after commodity...
8099 2018-05-29 12:28:39 Oil prices were that high for short period. There's about 2 decades of inflation in there as well.

You think 4 cents a litre carbon tax (has it even gone into effect yet) explains this?

Gas in Canada is almost the cheapest in the G7. It's double in Europe.

You've been conned!
8100 2018-05-29 12:28:18 And yet you keep saying doing more with little. Isn't that contradictory? Must the money come from a barrel of oil before we believe and say there is money? 
Govt should be seen to truthful and sincere. That will boost the confidence of the citizen on the govt.

8106 2018-05-29 12:27:41 Use coconut oil instead 
8107 2018-05-29 12:27:36 i cannot stop thinking that in the end #Trump will flee, either to #Russia or to his rich oil friends in #SaudiArabia, some where there is no extradition so he will never face judgment in a US court for his crimes of #Conspiracy and #ObstructionOfJustice.

8112 2018-05-29 12:26:43 Many years of importing and exporting oil and gas goods globally, the reason why we don’t find this a problem is because we understand the country, rules, laws and client spec we have to follow and plan accordingly!

8142 2018-05-29 12:22:40 everyone's had chicken oil, which most of it isn't even the real thing. But have you ever tried lemon grass oil? Now that shit iz teh bomb.
8143 2018-05-29 12:22:27 Marathon oil and marathon petroleum aren't the same company... Also WCS compares favourably with other heavy barrels for S%.
8144 2018-05-29 12:22:27 I mean if you read the underlying studies (or the npr interview anyway) it sounds like 1) men become more likely to cheat bc they feel emasculated, 2) women start doing even more of the housework to make them feel better and then get pissed cause they’re being burned at both ends
8145 2018-05-29 12:22:15 Someone comes into your place of business, doesn’t buy anything, takes up space that could be occupied by paying customers, uses your bathroom and wifi, messes up your bathroom, and you’re a racist for asking them to leave.

8346 2018-05-29 11:54:27 Most if not all of the eliquid shops sell CBD oil or simmeler so what is the big news here have you contacted them or labled them a cannabis shop ?
8347 2018-05-29 11:54:25 Broken record. Give it up. Meanwhile fuel prices keep getting higher driving cost up of virtually everything we eat, touch, ship. Costs consumers billions. All going in Big Oil’s pockets. Stinky.
8348 2018-05-29 11:54:16 Looking for someone who can come to our house and service and change the oil in or LQ horse trailer!

8357 2018-05-29 11:53:24 Abhey oy #feku - @narendramodi Crude Oil prices are falling internationally, why are they increasing every day now in India?
8358 2018-05-29 11:53:23 So do polluting oil slicks.  You've been conned Annie.
8359 2018-05-29 11:53:20 Just a matter of time before Justin and his Oil buddies starts spewing the CPC line that the increase in gas is because of the delay of KM. Canadian public en mass still believe that line and MSM helps the lie progress. #RealChange?

It’s about survival of American democracy - it’s about not letting the fake christians and fake patriots and Putin to decide about the future of American people.
8365 2018-05-29 11:52:29 @jaketapper  it plays to his uneducated base who believes all his snake oil.
8366 2018-05-29 11:52:28 Wow, that oil was so bad it looks like an actual black swan rather than a mute! Incredible job you did on clean-up, well done!

8400 2018-05-29 11:48:17 But all that was only possibly through the discovery of oil. Without oil money they wouldn't have been able to do all of that without it back firing. Regardless of them having a plan to build the way they did, they could only start doing so by being oil rich.
8401 2018-05-29 11:47:58 Renewed macro worry in Europe might the catalyst for the next leg up in crypto markets. Stocks down, oil down, bonds down, gold unchanged, crypto up across the board.

8411 2018-05-29 11:46:53 Andrew,  price of oil is irrelevant to requirement to safely transport it.

Kinder Morgan engineered a safe pipeline.

You and Horgan engineered a mutiny from moral behaviour in pursuit of crazy ideology .

The world will not end without TM, US instead will provide the oil.

8416 2018-05-29 11:46:19 Oil prices mixed, but pressure builds on expected crude output increase

Oil prices were mixed in Asian trading on Tuesday, but remained under pressure from expectations that Saudi Arabia and Russia would pump more crude to ease a potential shortfall in supply.

Worked beautifully.  :) I remember Mum buying a bag full of broken biscuits for us from a tiny corner store, the big tin of Arnotts' biscuits kept for when we had visitors.

The engineer has been so the oil boiler is serviced for another year.
After he’d finished & been paid, he saw a small water leak on his final check. Had to get out more equipment/bits from his van. All fixed at no extra cost to us.
That’s good customer service.

So why is Norway head and shoulders above all? Is that purely oil?
8472 2018-05-29 11:38:49 Yes. If you go to the website there are several doctors who talk about the great successes they have had by treating their patients with our CBD oil. Check it out!
8473 2018-05-29 11:38:45 Yes they have a richer history than you. State facts and titles without twisting stats by using garbage before and after so called oil money. Their owners are rich but only someone stupid would call that oil money cuz UAE is not an oil rich country PERIOD.

8481 2018-05-29 11:37:47 I'm not sure that's true @JohnnyMercerUK - Scotland (putting aside oil millionaires and similar "winners") is a poor country relative to England. I think she genuinely wants to make Scotland a better place. I'm not a nationalist, but the SNP probably cares most about Scotland.

8488 2018-05-29 11:36:38 Dr Oby Exekwesili is not making sense to me, what does signal do when you don't have kobo in your pocket to run the economy.

She forgot, The oil pipe line vandals (Avengers) from 2M barrels to 800k, oil price from $120 to $38, so where do signal come to play.

8519 2018-05-29 11:33:38 In truth I suspect it is about the relative decline of the western economies in the face of the oil price shock of the 1970s, technological change facilitating a globalised economy, and the rise of the far eastern economies and the social pressures these have created.

4: Violently spray cooking oil across my entire apartment

8564 2018-05-29 11:27:06 The solution for the oil price hike is not to abolish TRAIN bec of  excise tax but to  minimum fare for jeepney drivers who have not benefited in the  of take home pay bec of  withholding tax. We can bring the fare back to normal once the oil price normalizes.

8593 2018-05-29 11:23:56 @insightSBS  The communities of Narrabri and neighbouring towns have to look at growing hemp as an industrial crop, creating jobs for the locals and there are many positive points in doing so - low water usage, all parts of the plant from fibre to oil and improvement to the soil.

8622 2018-05-29 11:20:17 did some research. one percent of Dubai's economy is due to oil (as of twenty ten to now). 

turns out it is from: receiving loans; migrate labour abuse; exclusive deals with [then] UK; no corporate tax (invites business); tourism ; being an international shipping hub etc.
8623 2018-05-29 11:20:06 I’m saying beard oil will boost the growth. Seven seas will make it look good and boost it further
8624 2018-05-29 11:20:04 it wasn't just the French he sold it to it was many others. You realize Iran is the most dangerous nation in the middle East selling Uranium which the biggest producers of and you do realize you buy much of their oil At low prices. It was to assure they stop producing uranium

8629 2018-05-29 11:19:08 That may or may not but it will definitely reduce our dependency on imported oil which will save the precious foreign exchange. There is nothing wrong celebrities promoting environmentally green products and a healthy lifestyle.
8630 2018-05-29 11:19:07 Isn't it amazing.  I do not live in California, Cleveland, ohio and it is high here. Try again and the Republicans refuse a gas tax.  Of course you blame Democrats and not the ones in power.  No party is to blame.  Oil is near $100 a barrel.

8636 2018-05-29 11:18:35 I think Pence could sell snake oil. He seems to swim in it as he grovels to his supreme leader, Trump. He is so fake I think real Christians should consider shunning him. Worst, most corrupt administration ever outside of Russia.

8665 2018-05-29 11:15:07 Don’t understand why #OPEC and Russia start saying they will increase crude oil production, just increase and don’t say anything that way prices will at least keep stable

8795 2018-05-29 10:56:57 Foreign reserves rose on the tide of rising oil prices due to geo political tensions between US and Iran, and OPEC supply policy.

8812 2018-05-29 10:53:21 I'd partly agree - but it took Riddles rebuilding to make them truly successful. Perhaps their design outstripped available technology to a  degree - with the fire risk of the oil soaked lagging etc
8813 2018-05-29 10:53:04 Nigeria slipped into recession in 2008 when oil price crashed.
But it was averted because then our reserves was almost $45bn.
What do you expect to happen when your boss squandered our reserves and couldn't save amid an oil boom?
We had to recess because we had no option.

For lamb my dad did the lebneh or plain greek yogurt marinade w/onions, red wine & assorted spices, 

plus sumac, I like my zhataar & dried cimmi churri, but sometimes good greek, olive oil & lemon will do

9167 2018-05-29 10:01:20 People see what they both want to see. You are both proving this. But the fact that Israel's priority for Golan was foreign-funded oil exploration under foreign-funded military protection tells us a lot.

9170 2018-05-29 10:00:30 In LORIENT today, EDL is still applying a tariff which dates back to 1994 when oil price was $ 15 a barrel. In 2017 Govt subsidies to EDL went up to $ 1.33 bl. oil price having gone to $ 41.
Failing to stop wasting money on EDL would endanger Lebanon

9179 2018-05-29 09:59:32 On rising oil prices... Has BJP become more overconfident of winning 2019 elections by keeping Mum on rising Oil Prices and no steps taken.

9187 2018-05-29 09:58:41 Avocado Oil has always been the staple ingredient of my skin lotions. It really is a wonder food. Now, since learning about the devastation caused by amount of water used in their cultivation, I've decided to try UK grown #Rapeseed Oil instead. Much lower Carbon Footprint.

9197 2018-05-29 09:56:38 Dear Rajdeep, I would really appreciate if you use the same consciousness in questioning how come #UPA govt gave petrol for ₹50-55 when the crude oil was around $130? How is it possible to distribute at such less cost withso many taxes?Don't u think our state was under debt?

9214 2018-05-29 09:54:40 We always  save money but the use to which we put it, is what matters.When money from excess crude oil was saved during GEJ some governors led by Ameachi made sure it was squandered.Income generation through taxation  is a good move but sense of prudence must be employped.

9219 2018-05-29 09:54:24 Yes it does.  Energy is the new Oil, just look at Statoils rebranding.  Go look it up.

Scotland has 25% of the EUs natural energy production market.

Scotland will easily handle the 9bn, particularly when the have a central bank, stock market and attract international investment

9231 2018-05-29 09:52:25 Right. Let's trust a murdering assassin. He sounds like Ted Bundy. The only economy he's interested in is his own. The $200 billion in oil he can't get out of the ground because of sanctions. His puppet is stuck in the Poe room with the walls closing in on him. #NoExit
9232 2018-05-29 09:52:24 Firstly, great work by the @BudgITng  team. It is obvious the economy is in quite dire straits. Temporary fixes and false dawns like CBN's supply-side intervention in FX liquidity and OPEC-induced crude oil price spikes do nothing to mask the obvious as shown in these graphics...
9233 2018-05-29 09:52:19 @nolandalla Nolan, did Bill Smith's (85 WSOP winner) daughter ever contact you? I met her briefly while getting an oil change. She said she would like to get a banner up for her father but didn't know who to contact.  I gave her your name and told her you might be able to help.

Two major oil producers that were then interested in nuclear technology that Israel already developed in 60's.

9259 2018-05-29 09:47:51 That was the initial point of the dig though. Italy were defeated by Ethiopa(!) pre WW2 and were Axis during it, then surrendered and changed sides.

 I'm not debating what you said about recent wars being about oil/money/land because it's right.

9289 2018-05-29 09:43:16 If you ask me the Italy thing is totally overdone. For the moment they get an expert council instead of some idiotic populist government so that should be good news. But as option guy it's always the question to sit it out or to adjust .. and the oil rally was idiotic, too.
9290 2018-05-29 09:43:11 Yup
9291 2018-05-29 09:42:56 What’s going on with fuel prices here?! This is ridiculous. We’re in an oil producing country and we’re paying these crazy prices? We’re getting slaughtered at the pumps! Time for carpooling, or better yet, let’s just stay at home and screw work and everything else. What a joke.

9306 2018-05-29 09:40:39 @SenSchumer you were FOR higher oil/gasoline prices before you were against them
9307 2018-05-29 09:40:26 The Brent Crude oil price fell over 4% last week. Even if Russia and Saudi Arabia do not increase their output as they discussed this week, the oil price could fall further as Americans drive less and speculators unwind their positions now that the US dollar is strengthening.

UPA time Center was taking Rs9 tax per liter,now Center taking Rs21

9332 2018-05-29 09:36:18 @ANZ_NZ Overall, we expect the oil market to remain tight, given strong demand. This sets the scene for further price spikes should disruptions occur. Our 12-month target for Brent crude is USD80/bbl. #oil #oilprice #oilprices #brent #brentoil #CrudeOil #crude #forex #fx

9344 2018-05-29 09:33:42 Unfortunately it's moving too slow, as the developed countries are moving too fast, thereby fast out valuing our economy main survival pillar crude oil. By 2023, it will all over.
9345 2018-05-29 09:33:28 Not sure what your rates are like, but 500 for power is incredibly high. When I've had winter months where I'm running space heaters 24/7 because I would be out of heating oil for extended periods, the worst would be about 300~

9348 2018-05-29 09:33:14 What the hell is going on with petrol prices??
Five years ago or so, when the price hit $1.50 per litre for the first time ever, the price of crude oil was over $150 per barrel. Fair enough.
Now it's nearly $1.60 per litre, and the price per barrel is $66..Thieving bastards..
9349 2018-05-29 09:33:00 Mr. President, Could you please do something about the rising gas prices. I can help thinking it's the oil companies ripping us off. Please Help!!!

9353 2018-05-29 09:32:22 No better in Canada, especially when it comes to oil/gas. We are paying almost $1.50/litre which is almost 1/4 of a US gallon. That means about 5.60/gallon. CRAZY when you consider Canada is the 3rd most "Oil Rich" country in the world. Only behind Venezuela and Saudi Arabia.

9361 2018-05-29 09:30:21 Don't forget the project also of increasing fuel price,at the same time paying more fuel subsidy too,that topped off with increased oil price in the international market n no reduction in the former mentioned. That's an ongoing project lol

9372 2018-05-29 09:28:59 Indeed, look at oil prices. Take a closer look you will see they are presented in $
That is the symbol of the American dollar. The currency in which oil is traded.
If your local currency weakens against the $ you pay more.
9373 2018-05-29 09:28:52 Argument that sweat affects the polystyrene over time, making it more brittle - less efficient  when its meant to crumple and absorb impact. No idea if true. An egg box strapped to your head wont help if you're hit by a quarter ton of steel, rubber and oil at 40mph anyway.

9572 2018-05-29 08:55:15 Isn't that something how paint blisters on walls. I wonder if latex blisters differently in some way than oil paints?
9573 2018-05-29 08:54:22 Thank you, I shall take another look. (I have looked before but it’s good to remind myself) 
I’m a nightmare when grocery shopping, a vegetarian who won’t buy palm oil and tries to avoid all  single use plastics 
9574 2018-05-29 08:54:09 @yogrishiramdev Virgin Coconut Oil neither has any aroma nor any taste. It’s tasteless and bland. No smell. Does not look to be coconut oil at all. So expensive.

9579 2018-05-29 08:53:25 Somehow people are always surprised that when you have tons of money you wind up with tons of tax break money.  A guy making 50K isn't going to use tax breaks because he's not investing in risky offshore oil, or taking accelerated depreciation on $25million equipment purchases.
9580 2018-05-29 08:53:23 You don't get it. What do you think will happen when most countries will spend their last oil reserves, rendering their armies useless? And you will be left with just a handful of countries with oil reserves big enough to conquer?
9581 2018-05-29 08:53:23 Please, add the oil and stop unproductive criticism. Even if he had added oil, you could have said it was too oily.

9613 2018-05-29 08:46:55 Can you explain why US so desperately wants control over oil? Isn't it because no heavy military vehicles can move, or jets to fly, without it? I fear what will happen when there will be no natural oil to exploit, what the countries with biggest oil reserves may do.
9614 2018-05-29 08:46:38 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.

9644 2018-05-29 08:39:11 I tried taking cbd oil under my tongue for a few weeks, it tastes disgusting but washed it down with orange juice! It worked for background pain levels but as soon as I had a flare it didnt help much.

9647 2018-05-29 08:38:53 On. Cassette. I fucking hated cassettes when they were the only crap I could afford. Buy a box of no-name C90s at Kmart. Raid your mates’ record collections. Sounded like shit even when you splashed on BASF.

New cassettes smell of beard oil and recently expressed semen.

9649 2018-05-29 08:38:17 I personally vape cbd oil e-liquid, and I can't live without it. It helps me sleep (I had chronic insomnia before) and reduces my pain levels massively. Also because it's inhaled it works nearly instantly, and lasts for a few hours for me.
9650 2018-05-29 08:37:37 Russia & Saudi declared to increase oil production to reduce price pressure! I  do not buy as both can not pay such luxury given their budget balances.

9655 2018-05-29 08:36:55 Definitely. A proper central heating system (like a ducted heat pump) costs less to run than 3 oil heaters and keeps the temperature at livable levels in every room. Can be also used for cooling in summer.

9666 2018-05-29 08:33:02 The last point is clear. But the "centre" can manage the process until then and, hopefully, reorganise. (There are signs of this already). Of course without EU/DE support it will all be in vain. (And we have our helpful friend Clemens F pouring oil on the fire).

9673 2018-05-29 08:30:49 Because there is a very extreme ultraconservative, puritanical form of Islam called Wahhabism that is intertwined with the Saudi Arabian state. As Saudi Arabia become immensely rich because of oil, they exported this extreme ideology, causing the issues we see today.
9674 2018-05-29 08:30:17 Scottish and EU citizens actually... But English and Welsh get to pay a fee. For Post grad, everyone pays. Scotland has oil and very small population.. you really cannot compare with Nigeria.
9675 2018-05-29 08:30:02 The above sketched process would provide a repurposing of abandoned deep sea oil platforms to mine hydrogen & oxygen gasses & charge shipping container sized fuel cells for transport via cargo ships. These fuel cells could then power remote facilities including water purifiers.

9677 2018-05-29 08:29:44 They own half of that CCS plant in Houston,Petra Nova

9680 2018-05-29 08:28:50 Crude oil came down to 77dollar.... So why is it still increasing?
9681 2018-05-29 08:28:44 Why the price of petrol and diesel is not decreasing much in India, even though the crude oil price have reduced drastically?

9688 2018-05-29 08:26:53 Personally I think the BBC have a lot to answer for. Publishing a photo of a tattoo of a photo of a gun? That’s almost as bad a publishing a photo of a photo of a drawing of an oil painting of a stick that looks like a gun. Disgusting.

9691 2018-05-29 08:26:07 How much would a bottle of fresh coconut oil cost in the states? Because I got a liter of it for free. And  I’m talking fresh...no chemicals, no creams just pure oil. It smells better than raffello candies.
9692 2018-05-29 08:25:43 So what correlation were you able to develop between the oil and the dogma?

Imagine Nigerians celebrating an oil producing govt for providing common water. It's like we deserve what we get sometimes
9702 2018-05-29 08:22:57 Thank you Tony. Our economic statistics was revealing that we were the largest economy in Africa. Those statistics didn't translate to economic growth. Oil proceeds is the only reason we are even discussing Nigeria.
9703 2018-05-29 08:22:26 Every state has different laws for how much THC is allowed in CBD. In MS it’s 3-5% depending on which part of the law u look at. So I can legally order some from places who use MMJ oil as long as it is below 3%. So check ur state laws. But MANY MMJ sellers sell 0%THC CBD now
9704 2018-05-29 08:22:23 The Presidency should come clear on the widely reported stealing of N1.1 trillion (USD 3.5bn) worth of crude oil by APC interests operating with seven ghost companies.

9824 2018-05-29 07:58:32 Sir I admire you a lot sir but sir we really can't accept the price of petrol rs.80 recently the price of crude oil has gone down + the value of rupee compared to dollar has increased still the prices are high...
Please sir reduce the prices ASAP
9825 2018-05-29 07:58:26 yeah but there's an entire province and a bunch of FN's between there and the terminal who object and personally I'm not super fond of the idea that, IF we decide to keep exploiting oil, that we should sell it off to any multinational corporation for pennies on the dollar.
