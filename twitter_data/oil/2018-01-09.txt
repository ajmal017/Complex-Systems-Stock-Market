7 2018-01-09 23:58:55 So hold on, Maduro is actually in cahoots with the guys who used to run the oil industry? So, them protesting nationalization and abandoning their factories leaving the workers to seize control? So does do the castros destroy capital or do they support oligarchies?
8 2018-01-09 23:58:50 i think there's a lot of people who believe that all water can have oil under it and the act of drilling is what causes the oil to appear
9 2018-01-09 23:58:47 Not sure why exporting oil salmon and whisky is described as a problem. Clear that it will continue and whatever deal UK and Ireland have will be copied for Scotland.

11 2018-01-09 23:58:44 I mean what is the interest in drilling atm china has said by 2020ish they only want to sell eletrc cars? seems over time less oil will be needed not more?

39 2018-01-09 23:58:10 I always tip when I get an oil change!
40 2018-01-09 23:58:03 Where is the evidence of unsafe oil drilling? We've had one major oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in recent times and that was because it was pushed so far off the coast they had to drill deep down into dangerous waters. You're a liberal hack who needs to be voted out of office!
41 2018-01-09 23:58:00 Maralago with oil platform! Much prettier.
42 2018-01-09 23:57:50 @Ryan915 Btw cbd oil can test positive for THC in a drug test its a false positive so if you work at a place with drug tests you will need to ask for a further test as the Cbd can read as a false negative as theres small amounts of thc left in it
43 2018-01-09 23:57:41 Styrofoam & oil - light it up
44 2018-01-09 23:57:22 I've been finding it a little bizarre (shallow pandering?) to hear politicians from Oregon, Maine, Washington (where there is no oil) lay down the line in the sand "We will have no drilling!"  

They're right, but they don't have to put up a political fight to get there.

+23% PREMIUM.
KLCI BULL, HIBISCUS BULL
SUPER RALLY
59 2018-01-09 23:55:51 California can't stop the drilling, but it can prevent any pipelines being built to bring the oil to shore. Which is sufficient to make drilling unviable.
60 2018-01-09 23:55:49 Some people swear by coconut oil ... I swear by olive oil... For everything
61 2018-01-09 23:55:34 But not really 4th, right?
62 2018-01-09 23:55:32 Use veggie oil & water
63 2018-01-09 23:55:23 By line pockets does that mean lower gas prices? Yes. Lower our dependence on foreign oil? Yes? It's a good thing
64 2018-01-09 23:55:20 I have herds of cats I need to feed and can't risk an oil spill on the shag carpet.
65 2018-01-09 23:55:20 We ran out of heating oil and can't afford more so I might freeze to death

70 2018-01-09 23:54:48 I never used oil but I've taken CBD jellies. I hadn't interacted much w/ weed before that, so I started out w half doses. CBD by itself didn't have any real "wow-wow" obvious effect with me aside from calm, focus, basically feeling "normal".
71 2018-01-09 23:54:48 Oil operating temperatures in those black pipes about 100 degrees. Up to 200 if they are hydraulic fluid. And under pressure. I've seen a hydraulic one blow and burn someone on a dozer/very ugly. #burninjury

77 2018-01-09 23:54:28 “Trump moves to open nearly ALL offshore waters to drilling.” That’s great Mr. President. Do you remember the BP Oil Spill? How many more of those can we handle? Oh yeah.. we’ve got unlimited amount of Earth, it doesn’t matter!
78 2018-01-09 23:54:27 the back of the packet has a little window revealing... lumpy foil packets! very informative! it's roasted broad bean snacks, quite spicy. ingredients are: broad beans, rapeseed oil, sugar, brewing vinegar, edible salt, chicken flavour seasoning, chili pepper,...

81 2018-01-09 23:54:08 Oil drilling off the coast of blue states only or non swing states.
82 2018-01-09 23:54:05 You’ll probably live longer with the vegetables tbh. Maybe the shortening in the filling is made of vegetable oil? 
83 2018-01-09 23:53:59 Idiots who would rather give millions to countries that hate us instead of having enough oil of our own.
84 2018-01-09 23:53:56 Oil will have to be at $100/bbl to use a deep-sea rig.

86 2018-01-09 23:53:54 Oil, gas, and healthcare are the most inelastic products surpassed only by caffein and drugs (including alcohol).  So it’s almost always a good idea to go into those industries. Just throwing it out.  Okay I will keep listening.
87 2018-01-09 23:53:48 They should all be rescinded. No need to drill for oil. Look at renewable assets

109 2018-01-09 23:52:19 At one point I thought this was all largely about accounting shenanigans rather than actually drilling for oil.
110 2018-01-09 23:52:17 The Trump administration says it will not allow oil drilling off the coast of Florida, bowing to pressure from Republican Gov. Rick Scott.
111 2018-01-09 23:52:03 Right
112 2018-01-09 23:52:02 I imagine the life of a dark-skinned model involves running from people trying to douse her in baby oil 24/7
113 2018-01-09 23:51:58 Argan oil.... detangling spray will make it worse
114 2018-01-09 23:51:54 But @realDonaldTrump will bugger up the Alaskan wildlife refuge for oil no problem, because it was a provision tied to a tax plan meant to enrich himself, his family, and his wealthy friends at the expense of common Americans and their tireless investment into earned benefits.
115 2018-01-09 23:51:49 Just imagine what an oil leak would do to the FL tourist industry & to real estate values of those ocean front condos..... Of course, there's Maralago & Trump's properties in Little Moscow Miami.

118 2018-01-09 23:51:27 Allowing the pipeline to go forward.  Allowing oil drilling off of the New York and California coast? Damaging schools by crippling the education system appointing DeVose?  Tell me which one of these are good act I DARE YOU
119 2018-01-09 23:51:22 I wasn’t even being rude. I was stating facts. Not everyone can get wetter than Michael Phelps and that’s ok. I agree coconut Oil would made a great lube. 
120 2018-01-09 23:51:22 It’s really simple. There’s an oil price below which Scotland is a basket case and above which we are all selfish greedy bastards who should be ashamed of ourselves for threatening to cut off funding for HS2, etc.
121 2018-01-09 23:51:12 To clarify: it's not merely his play, rather, it's with the chemistry of the line as a whole. It doesn't seem like a match with him and McDavid nor draisaitl. Some fresh combinations are needed which may leave Lucic on the 3rd line--that need not be a bad thing is what I'm saying

126 2018-01-09 23:50:35 If you say “nationalize our oil industry” three times in front of the mirror, Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney will appear and run a train on you
127 2018-01-09 23:50:24 To claim that we don't need to process oil (because that is what he was complaining about - refineries) because he has moved to a Tesla is a false statement. The outputs of refineries (the issue at hand) remain necessary to run our economy

131 2018-01-09 23:49:48 In most surveys, you already know where something 'is' e.g an Oil manifold, or the region is being mapped to an agreed resolution to enable decisions e.g on further exploration. In the case of the Submarine, the puzzle (as we know) is, 'where could she be in the first place?'
132 2018-01-09 23:49:43 It was pretty funny and this time he is actually right.
133 2018-01-09 23:49:32 Bend over for big oil, Ryan. I’ll be interested to see your net worth in 5 years.

Says you. Actually we do need the oil!
135 2018-01-09 23:49:19 I bit the bullet & got a new Prius & it's looking like I'll save approximately $2,100 on oil changes & gas compared to my 1980 Camaro.

I'm paying an extra $600 & $425 for insurance and tabs.

Total savings = $1,075 per year

That's about $90/month to put towards my car payment
136 2018-01-09 23:49:18 Kind of worried about that oil rig on fire in the ocean, could be worse than the worst oil spill we have ever had ...killing a lot of animals and plants :(

142 2018-01-09 23:48:42 That’s whats holding me back too! I’m afraid of how bad it’s going to hurt because of the scar tissue. I use tea tree oil and will rub some on the scar tissue even though it smells so strong it’s been working!
143 2018-01-09 23:48:28 @realDonaldTrump Over 12% of US citizens live in California. We do not want your oil drilling here. Please stay away
144 2018-01-09 23:48:25 I'm still pissed that they came out as anti oil but liberals say, pity the poor workers they need $15 an hour and then call to boycott the places that they make $15 at is ridiculous.
145 2018-01-09 23:48:25 i bought almond butter bc it looks good but i tried it and it’s not that great so it’s been sitting on the counter for like a long time and it’s 1/3 oil
146 2018-01-09 23:48:25 Caster oil will do
147 2018-01-09 23:48:18 I thought you were talking about oil cause products have been builds, my bad
148 2018-01-09 23:48:17 No oil, pipes froze and are broke i assume.
149 2018-01-09 23:48:17 How so? His 9 goals would put him fourth on this year's Oilers ...
150 2018-01-09 23:47:55 Oil
151 2018-01-09 23:47:47 What about the other states?

I read that trump tried to get wind turbines removed because he did not like view from a golf course

How does he think oil rigs will look?
152 2018-01-09 23:47:42 The change oil light in my car is demon who sucks my soul while simultaneously fuels my anxiety
153 2018-01-09 23:47:38 more faux outrage from Sid? I'm shocked
154 2018-01-09 23:47:34 Oil revenue isn't squandered by the Scottish Government. It can't be. All of it goes to Westminster.
155 2018-01-09 23:47:24 @GDeLaurentiis can you please start selling calabrian chili oil on your shop? I can't find it anywhere and I really want to make some of your recipes that call for it. thanks!
156 2018-01-09 23:47:23 Need to unite against that oil money
157 2018-01-09 23:47:19 America already has more available oil than Saudi Arabia.

160 2018-01-09 23:46:51 And the Tea Tree Oil was recommended by my girlfriend that shit stink too but it grew my hair a lot along with washing my hair once a week and deep conditioning every 2 weeks
161 2018-01-09 23:46:50 Standard Chartered: We expect oil demand growth to outpace non-OPEC supply growth in both 2018 and 2019. In our view, the back of the Brent and WTI curves are both still underpriced. We do not think that prices below $US65 per barrel are sustainable into the medium term. #OOTT
162 2018-01-09 23:46:44 I did two back to back interviews tonight and the unexpectedly common thread between them is that everyone on Broadway is sick and drinking oregano oil in order to get better.
163 2018-01-09 23:46:41 Bullshit, it's because he doesn't want to see a giant ugly oil rig off the coast of Mar-a-lago.
164 2018-01-09 23:46:33 Finally got a leaf blower to start today on my own AND I learned how to start a chainsaw AND all about the gas/oil that’s used for machines like that. 
165 2018-01-09 23:46:15 why is there a picture of JBO on when talking about CBD oil? :)
166 2018-01-09 23:46:10 I want the California protected shores to stay protected up here north of San Luis Obispo. The oil rigs off the coast of Santa Barbara are an eyesore.
167 2018-01-09 23:46:00 The Trump administration says it will not allow oil drilling off the coast of Florida, bowing to pressure from Republican Gov. Rick Scott.
168 2018-01-09 23:45:55 Why rename it? So you can destroy the land with another oil pipeline?
169 2018-01-09 23:45:51 Venezuela’s a sad panorama. But it’s worth recalling that seemingly defunct #oil sectors tend to recover with astonishing speed once given half a chance.
170 2018-01-09 23:45:50 No oil drilling. How about wind farms??
171 2018-01-09 23:45:44 A Deep Horizon type of oil spill wouldn't be too good for tourism on Miami Beach.
172 2018-01-09 23:45:40 Until they discover oil there and you okay drilling . . .

176 2018-01-09 23:45:27 Oil drilling won't happen off the Oregon Coast either!
177 2018-01-09 23:45:23 Sen. Nelson statement on Trump offshore drilling reversal: "“I have spent my entire life fighting to keep oil rigs away from our coasts. But now, suddenly, Secretary Zinke announces plans to drill off Florida's coast and four days later agrees to "take Florida off the table?"
178 2018-01-09 23:45:19 Just saw this, just straight coconut oil?? I’ve been drinking a lot more water!
179 2018-01-09 23:45:11 Just had to argue with someone who questions the science behind the circadian rhythm; but believes in endless amounts of snake oil remedies. 

It was a wild ride.
180 2018-01-09 23:45:07 I wish my mom was here to oil my hair
181 2018-01-09 23:44:55 Well, thank god for that. Now stop oil drilling in Alaska and the arctic!
182 2018-01-09 23:44:51 I'm buying and burning it, not selling it.  Hope it goes back to $40 and takes gasoline and heating oil with it.
183 2018-01-09 23:44:51 How about it serves the purpose of the US not being dependent on foreign oil! For Christ’s sakes! Where is your pride in our country and being self sufficient for ourselves?!?!
184 2018-01-09 23:44:49 Truly #flakenews.  I guess this is freedom of speech but she is modern "snake oil salesman"  Common sense things like DRINKING coffee for its antioxidants is much more enjoyable than enema  Geez

186 2018-01-09 23:44:44 Today I watched a segment about all of the chemicals that leach into our water from plastic micro beads on TRTWorld while waiting to do my segment on oil and, well, I’m hoping it’s not true because ... ugh, its bad.
187 2018-01-09 23:44:42 Does any one else see the parity in the front page.... "A SEA OF BLACK" - and - trump drilling for oil clip! LMAO..... YOU WIN THREE TIMES! LOL..... (YOUR CAUSE) (SEA OF BLACK /oil) and (yawn) - NO ONE CARING ABOUT TRUMP! you could not have done this any better if you tried! FUN!

190 2018-01-09 23:44:21 dad: “ i’m gonna check your oil” 
dad: “actually it’s been a long day, i’m going to eat a burrito instead”
191 2018-01-09 23:44:17 Or is real reason so oil spills don’t wash up at Mar-a-Lago or his other properties...

203 2018-01-09 23:42:50 I forgot that I drenched my body in coconut oil and slipped off the wooden chair in the kitchen
204 2018-01-09 23:42:50 So in that case, it's awesome that there is a good fallback plan where, despite being overpaid, he can still contribute.

211 2018-01-09 23:42:27 Anyone else hate when my dad walks in on you applying bust oil #daddynotnowimapplyingbustoil
212 2018-01-09 23:42:24 Sure, I agree with you. But I still think his play leaves something to be desired, and personally I'm looking for other options in the top six. Now if that's going to take place, Lucic has to go somewhere and he doesn't exactly have trade value considering his contract
213 2018-01-09 23:42:22 get it!! Here are the steps I did: 
- steam 3 mins
- cleanse (I used my Clarisonic) 
- exfoliate 
- mask (steam the whole time! I did mine for about 5-7 mins)
- toner
- serum & eye cream
- night oil/moisturizer

220 2018-01-09 23:41:28 Who has thought about trying the oil that is helping so many people get healthy but still has questions?
221 2018-01-09 23:41:14 and let the oil drilling begin

224 2018-01-09 23:40:56 He has the idea that an oil spill in the rest of the Gulf stays in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas.  It will drift to the east...meaning Florida.  Oh yeah, there's an example of this.

231 2018-01-09 23:40:34 Maybe if we didn’t passively support an invasion of Iran during WW2 then overthrow their government in the 50s to keep their oil we wouldn’t be dealing with this mess today. You reap what you sow.

244 2018-01-09 23:39:37 @TheRealDaybyDay Important weekly trade update:
Due to cycle extensions, I no longer see the same set ups as previously posted (expectation was for 1/8-1/9 lows). Next week looks bullish, but this week now looks down. I am still short oil, and will short GDXJ if we ge the bounce
245 2018-01-09 23:39:31 Is it not remarkable? Simple oil of cloves, and how amazing the results

254 2018-01-09 23:38:59 Link to this oil pls
255 2018-01-09 23:38:55 IMO the economic problems in Venezuela are because of their dependency on oil as their main commodity, dependence on imports, and currency control has incentivized corruption plus for profit companies have outperformed state run ones.
256 2018-01-09 23:38:50 Who does oil changes for the low?

261 2018-01-09 23:38:26 Promoting community policing is like recognizing climate change as a problem but supporting fracked gas as the solution to get off oil
262 2018-01-09 23:38:26 I know someone here in Lagos he is into palm kernel business that means he makes his own palm oil ..
263 2018-01-09 23:38:11 And why is it that drilling in the ocean gets to solely benefit the oil companies.  They don’t own the ocean.  It should benefit the people
264 2018-01-09 23:38:08 I hope someday that when you have something bad happen, the people around you treat you with the same glee at your misfortune that you do these people.

280 2018-01-09 23:36:53 You say red tape, I say protections. Are you personally going to pay to clean up the resulting oil spill?

289 2018-01-09 23:35:07 Maybe the joke is that America is getting fatter and soon our military will be nothing but over weight people who can't meet requirements but hell we got to invade someone for oil *cough*
290 2018-01-09 23:35:07 Thinking about "Unionism",,is there a cream or ointment for it?
"Batshits wonder elixir",cures mild and severe cases of unionism of any kind
Or maybe "Oil of Union",better not go there though
"Unionoids" "Labourcain"
291 2018-01-09 23:35:02 What a disgraceful bunch of people you are there will be no greyhound racing without the tracks for them to race causing deaths and dogs to be put down I bet you are working for the gra or the oil pension fund
292 2018-01-09 23:34:57 I really like the body shop’s tea tree oil facial cleaner and clinique’s cleaning lotion which is basically a toner
293 2018-01-09 23:34:52 My hair literally absorbs coconut oil 
294 2018-01-09 23:34:48 Soap and oil (or balm if it's longer), works a treat, can't stop stroking my beard for a few hours after getting out of the shower (then combing it), so fluffy and soft
295 2018-01-09 23:34:22 In a world void of livestock would see the use of fossil fuel (oil) based fertilisers increased to maintain yields, google nitrous oxide and see how its 300x more destructive than carbon and 15x more than methane.
296 2018-01-09 23:34:21 This beard oil has my beard smelling scrumptious
297 2018-01-09 23:34:21 Very wrong, you always had a voice. What's ironic is that somehow you believe this guy bc he looks like you, PRETENDS to worship like you. He has NO clue. But he's a snake oil salesman & you've bought his product. Unfortunately bc he's weakening the CFPB, you won't have a defense
298 2018-01-09 23:34:21 After the snake oil salesman Trump was elected there is no more standard. 2020 will be known as Oprah vs. Doprah. The truly self-made billionaire versus the trust fund bankruptcy King
299 2018-01-09 23:34:16 Just wondering.  Does “make America Great Again” mean the return of the snake oil salesman?
300 2018-01-09 23:34:11 ...unless they discover oil, gas or coal underneath it.
301 2018-01-09 23:34:07 I don't plug a cracker often, but a few Keebler Town House Flatbread Crisps Sea Salt & Olive Oil are good to take your pills with.

309 2018-01-09 23:33:04 Relying on crude oil with so many alternatives available that are renewable, makes as much sense as relying on whale oil and coal in this day and age #Evolve

311 2018-01-09 23:32:48 I'm not short oil yet...but add a final short today on Gold...I feel yesterday was the last run and gone a bit lazy

313 2018-01-09 23:32:28 I can say three words that don't have anything to do with the previous comment as well.

Zits. Oil. Secretions.
314 2018-01-09 23:32:25 Not sure Lucic has been a disappointment and if being honest, most would say he's pretty much delivered what's been expected. The problem is his price tag & term. From a cap space perspective, on this team, it is very close to catastrophic.
315 2018-01-09 23:32:15 taking you for the updates ! i stopped watching years ago that annoying 
ex -GS evil clown selling snake oil
316 2018-01-09 23:32:08 well i just rendered my oil machines useless by going gatherer/botanist for foraging

329 2018-01-09 23:29:08 In other news, my dog Hanzo is growing his fur back. Thanks to an aggressive flea killing medication... and some coconut oil. Sucks I had to have the one dog that's allergic to fleas. T_T
330 2018-01-09 23:29:05 This guy is farcical.  I've seen I think 3-4 Popes, and this one... my gut tells me he's bad. Gotten to.. a wolf in sheep's clothing. I don't know how to explain it. But.. Water and Oil. I love God(not religious), but he and I don't mix.
331 2018-01-09 23:28:57 LOL!  Apparently nobody knows but you and @oilfractals, because crude #oil prices rocketed higher on the news.

337 2018-01-09 23:27:20 I understand why the people at the car place last week took forever for my oil change and ignored me--considering I got a notification that my appointment is tomorrow.
338 2018-01-09 23:27:16 Wanna get a bounty bar and fill it with coconut oil and give it to my best mate
339 2018-01-09 23:27:14 I just got really hot chicken grease on my face and it burns. Don’t tear open freshly-cooked-in-oil chicken

342 2018-01-09 23:27:02 So, if you believe we deserve a toxin free healthy environment, compare hemp based products to oil based products. We need to change the incredibly misguided laws regarding hemp, and cannabis. Please learn and spread the word. Dump Sessions!

345 2018-01-09 23:26:49 The medical field is supposedly JUST NOW realizing Canola oil is bad for you?! So typical of United States medical practices. Their ultimate goal is to make most citizens of U.S. fat, placid, motionless and dependant upon opiates, benzodiazepines & as many other meds as possible.
346 2018-01-09 23:26:40 Lol. Where's this oil
347 2018-01-09 23:26:16 @LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity  NPR Los Angeles reports on drilling for oil this week were blatantly racist against "white males"
348 2018-01-09 23:26:14 Hillary Clinton admitted to creating Taliban and Al-Qaeda too, sworn enemies of Iran responsible for killing so many all over the Middle East, Americans know the truth they are simply compulsive liars. Anything to create another war in a country they hope to milk for oil.
349 2018-01-09 23:25:28 Haha just threw some stuff together! Beeswax, shea butter, coconut oil... It's not an exact art at all. And none of the irritans/drying ingredients in store bought
350 2018-01-09 23:25:25 Is "our transportation system" monolithic in this respect? It's no use driving electric commuter cars because passenger aircraft will still be burning kerosene and cargo ships bunker oil? Why not fix the part of the problem we can fix? (Unless you don't think it's a problem.)

359 2018-01-09 23:24:05 No, I’ve never heard of it. However I find it incredible the SNP are obsessed with extracting every last drop of oil from the North Sea whilst claiming fracking is bad for the environment!
360 2018-01-09 23:23:58 I don't know why you all are not ashamed, an OPEC country suffering from Oil. Ole people. #Incompetence
361 2018-01-09 23:23:56 Oil drilling slated to begin there soon.
362 2018-01-09 23:23:52 Though I couldn’t find a recipe that featured this, using shortening (rather than a liquid oil) as the fat would probably produce a lighter, flakier, less-oily pastry.
363 2018-01-09 23:23:49 Update - thank you for the prayers. My Peppermint Oil and electrolytes are dulling some of the pain.
364 2018-01-09 23:23:47 as ever i'm late  but thank you @HebePoetry for publishing my poems 'sunflower study' and 'oil on canvas, 12"x 16"' in the third edition! check em out and all the other amazing poetry+art 
365 2018-01-09 23:23:47 "oi" are single syllable. "Oil" is close to "awl". Others sound like they say "oh-ee-uhl". "School" is "skoo-uhl". Miss Umbach ruined me for  hearing things most folks don't notice. But, by 2nd grade, I could read mom's college textbooks! Now you know why I love Felicity.
366 2018-01-09 23:23:40 I am trying to figure out a good brand name for this snake oil.
367 2018-01-09 23:23:28 With H2, if you convince the key stakeholders (oil co's, gas station chains) you can roll out many stations at once. (350 kW chargers are being rolled out, but could suffer steep demand charges, reducing utilization and hurting the economics.)  /4
368 2018-01-09 23:23:16 i hopped up on the essential oil train so hmu with ur recipes for my diffuser rn i have rosemary mint in it and im in love
369 2018-01-09 23:23:14 Can confirm. Clove oil broke down not just grinder lid, but its line cord as well.
370 2018-01-09 23:23:08 Maybe if I dump my stress relief oil in my diffuser and put it in the bathroom I’ll not freak out in the shower when all my life’s issues hit.
371 2018-01-09 23:22:52 YouTube said I'm supposed to see oil coming out of the mixture after ten minutes. I'm yet to see that happen.
372 2018-01-09 23:22:49 Stove oil to the rescue
373 2018-01-09 23:22:31 What could possibly go wrong? I thought the idea of tactical nuclear weapons was given up long ago. Leave it to @realDonaldTrump to revive another bad idea...trickle down economics, revive coal, drilling for oil wherever. The list goes on and on.
374 2018-01-09 23:22:16 Moral of the story & $750 later: don’t crack your oil pan enthusiastically driving your phat ass to Jimmy Johns
375 2018-01-09 23:22:12 Good thing there are not any oil or coal possibilities on that and.

Well done! 
379 2018-01-09 23:22:00 Too many in media, like Thug-in-Chief's cult followers, are addicted to the snake oil & now need a daily supply.
380 2018-01-09 23:22:00 I hate having to pay to do stuff to my car. Like oil changes and new windshield wipers

389 2018-01-09 23:20:55 Belize will indefinitely end new oil exploration in its waters. Belize only produces 3,000 barrels of oil a day, cf. 1.5 million barrels by the US in the Gulf of Mexico. But their action is a key signal to developing countries trying to balance economic development & conservation
390 2018-01-09 23:20:47 okay yeah ur right honestly oil painting was so tough especially since my teacher was breathing down my back BUT it’s better than acrylic and you’ll get expiernece in oil painting

396 2018-01-09 23:19:37 George, no one cares about Michael Moore. He is a slob. If he wants to drill for oil, while observing safety regulations and being responsible for any problems, more power to him. No one really cares especially Donald Trump. He’s like a gnat on Trumps arm. Insignificant.

400 2018-01-09 23:19:29 Maybe he's a follower of David Wolfe and feels Alberta can create green oil by hanging it upside down and removing gravity toxins?

402 2018-01-09 23:19:27 Watch for news of the imminent visit of the (woman!) Norway Prime Minister to King Trumpus. Norway has similar issues, would like to open more of the #Barents Sea (profitability of oil for them) but have large push-back element from environmentalists. #FlyOnTheWall

407 2018-01-09 23:18:32 Never heard of it, but I don't drink those disgusting cans of snake oil.
408 2018-01-09 23:18:23 What if the current rally in oil is a short covering rally from Shale producers having locked in nearly the entire 2018 production at an average of 52 USD per barrel?  Shale production is unlikely to increase due to low hedges, which drives prices even higher.  #OOTT
409 2018-01-09 23:18:12 Yes, they are awful, worse than that, the oil that they were fried in was then "tainted" with the flavor, so it had to be disposed of.
410 2018-01-09 23:18:07 Bechamel sauce is a white sauce relatively asy to make.

Or just a bit of oil and spice.
411 2018-01-09 23:18:03 So I called our oil company cause we have a service plan and someone MIGHT be out tonight. Tho Matt’s plumber friend is coming to check it out for us cause he’s the best

415 2018-01-09 23:17:54 Very nice oil like quality #BatB
416 2018-01-09 23:17:38 But don’t be thinking you’ll be going to any big draft night parties at the Viv. Said oil company will be holding a convention that night. But maybe we can rent the LDS conference center
417 2018-01-09 23:17:28 Got some goodies at Wholefoods  Grapeseed hair/skin oil, witch hazel toner, castor oil and Tom’s of Maine deodorant.
418 2018-01-09 23:17:25 Is this post trim? Seems good to me!

We have similar density in beards, but yours has generally straighter hairs. With the right brush and oil or balm, you should be able to grow a thick but controlled look.
419 2018-01-09 23:16:56 Why bomb Iraq? Well we did all say that at the time - obv terrorism had nothing to do with it, it was because US and UK wanted Iraqi oil. 

Have you been in a coma since 2000 or something?

424 2018-01-09 23:16:15 I do not think that this painting is sold by Sotheby's. Also, I think authentic Pollock oil paintings sell for tens of millions of dollars, so $1.5M sounds a bit too good to be true  Just saying 
425 2018-01-09 23:15:55 There must not be oil in those there lands or it would never would have gotten the designation
426 2018-01-09 23:15:37 Ah thanks! Everyone here is fun! If you're not I think you get boiled down for oil or something.

433 2018-01-09 23:14:38 Don't think this can't hit YOU.  I eat sensibly and take fish oil but suffered endless colds, exhaustion and agonising arms aches.

Could gas prices rise? Maybe? eg if: big exports; field declines; reduction in co-produced oil value.

505 2018-01-09 23:06:26 I’d say that oil market will crash before
506 2018-01-09 23:06:19 California has some of the highest gas prices and taxes in the country. More oil may help lower costs. Unless you prefer elevated oil prices so higher taxes can be collected.

569 2018-01-09 22:58:05 Yes. You can use original A&D (baby butt ointment), it’s great for winter and flying.
Or make a salve with equal parts coconut oil, beeswax, and a few drops of essential oil, just make sure it’s something you really like smelling, and doesn’t burn.
Or just olive oil.
570 2018-01-09 22:58:02 Thinking about becoming an oil tycoon
571 2018-01-09 22:57:45 Sure you will you snake oil salesman.
572 2018-01-09 22:57:30 最高すぎか・・・・・・・・・・・・　これアイコンにしてもよろしいかしら？
573 2018-01-09 22:57:02 Yes. And one Republican speaking climate truth is worth 10 liberals in the struggle to get the Republican Party to give up its support of oil and coal.
574 2018-01-09 22:56:47 And don’t forget to send $$ because nothing influences God like making these snake oil peddlers rich
575 2018-01-09 22:56:44 Trump has always looked like a throwaway for Koch-boy Pence, and he even appears to be trying to speed the process. Their aim looks like an empire, w/ the US co-equal with Russia, advancing white supremacy, oil, shipping, money laundering, dominionist Christianity, & creepy IT.
576 2018-01-09 22:56:10 Yeah, if Trump gives a puppy a treat, that's great, but if he does it while grabbing someone's pussy on a whale hunt from his new oil derrick next to the Statue of Liberty, I'm gonna say that's a net loss. Everything Trump is a net loss.
577 2018-01-09 22:55:54 For now, try the priming oil + restoring balm for your beard needs! 
578 2018-01-09 22:55:50 ... and then 5 minutes later, he opened it up to oil drilling.
579 2018-01-09 22:55:26 Ten minutes at most, i use a straightening brush and some oil to stop frizz and thats it most of the time, i have some products to set it a little more, but i rarely use them.  I have considered using a curling iron because i think i would look nice with loose curls..
580 2018-01-09 22:55:16 Oil, coal and natural gas industries
581 2018-01-09 22:55:14 After tonight, I have 3 days off and so much adulting to do...oil change, tire rotation, renew drivers license, laundry...how did I get roped in to this adult thing. I didn’t sign up for this...
582 2018-01-09 22:55:13 I see oil rigs offshore
583 2018-01-09 22:55:13 Did TB go on to say "We are fighting the Iraqis....or indeed anyone else who stands in the way of oil and profit!"?
584 2018-01-09 22:55:05 22年ぶりというパワーワード、凄すぎます。当時18歳でも40歳！
585 2018-01-09 22:55:04 You are trying to sound like you know what you are talking about- except you don’t-without England as a burden oil rich Scotland with it’s vast wealth would be around the 4th richest nation per capa - every nation would want to trade with Scotland
586 2018-01-09 22:54:59 we’re at the macaroni grille with janice if you didn’t know……psssstt steal the olive oil
587 2018-01-09 22:54:59 So I don't if I don't add hair products on my hair it's dry then if I add a tiny bit of hair cream oil it looks greasy asf. What should I do ?
588 2018-01-09 22:54:47 after 3 hours trying to remove and replace the oil filter in a 2015 Expedition, I've decided I'd rather be consumed by a plague of locusts than buy a Ford.
589 2018-01-09 22:54:25 #Tuesdayliventa if Nigeria still dill oil from Niger delta why not sea port Mr minister your reason is not convincing whatever Nigeria did to ensure that oil is dill in Niger delta should like wise be done to ensure seaport
590 2018-01-09 22:54:16 Fuel Oil and concrete turning up tomorrow. Hopefully not at the same time or I will be having a few issues.  Of course the original plan was they turned up on different days.
591 2018-01-09 22:54:10 Motorists advised to use HWY 166 to get to the "Island of Montecitio" use EXTREME CAUTION-since Refugio oil spill & closure of the Gaviota Pipeline, Oil is now being transported daily in Tanker Trucks-both ways (cars passing ) on 2 lane HWY 166 to 5 Freeway. #CAstorm #ThomasFire
592 2018-01-09 22:53:59 Probably to stock up on oil and food.
593 2018-01-09 22:53:47 had a ton of scallion i didn't know what to do with so i'm making homemade scallion pancakes because the only other ingredients are flour, water, and sesame oil so i can't mess this up
594 2018-01-09 22:53:41 They need to stop this lie now, or many many people will die. We are moving into a mini ice age, and it will get bad in the 2020s. Solar minimum, just a cycle. I hate the idea of more oil pumps, but we will need them to stay warm.
595 2018-01-09 22:53:27 You ever see something so scarring you want to jump into a pit of hot oil
596 2018-01-09 22:53:19 Ha, your electricity must be really expensive if coal and oil are your top two sources. Sorry about your luck.
597 2018-01-09 22:52:37 #RBD broker target 2.7p , derisked at 9.4p. Currently at .80 this will be massive will oil price rocketing..
598 2018-01-09 22:52:26 Think about the noises. So much deep mouthy phlegmy grunts and moans. And smacking of skinny. Sweaty wet skin

Oh and the smells. So much aroma ham and chorizo and burnt vegetable oil in the air.
599 2018-01-09 22:52:09 Changing a "Site" to a "Park." Does this mean you'll be drilling for oil there sometime soon?
600 2018-01-09 22:52:06 Thanks. I call "products" refined liquids from oil processing. That's why I could not come to grips with the previous statement.

606 2018-01-09 22:51:15 Yep! Try adding a little bit to a liquid. But black seed oil works like a charm
607 2018-01-09 22:50:56 Wow!  Just look at those prices in the photo. I wish it was still that price and we weren't being bent over the oil barrel. Robbing twunts.
608 2018-01-09 22:50:40 was big oil withdrawal, but that gasoline build might offset some
609 2018-01-09 22:50:35 Back in the 1970s exploratory drilling off the coast of NJ found natural gas-rich formations which means the production of oil from these wells would be minimal if not zero. The opposition to these types of gas wells is as irrational as the movie Reefer Madness.
610 2018-01-09 22:50:27 Another one of the snake oil salesman Trump people, maybe he can play with your....... and make you happy
611 2018-01-09 22:50:26 How about we quit messing with them .... don’t forget we the USA helped over throw their democratic elected country to put the Shah of Iran in charge to help oil companies
612 2018-01-09 22:50:24 Fame & trust it don’t mix like oil in the water
613 2018-01-09 22:50:16 All this market stupidly makes me more determined than ever to come out of this with a win

616 2018-01-09 22:49:58 He had a picture of an oil rig on his 2010 campaign website, with text that said, "Rick supports expansion of...off-shore drilling." 

On 5/26/10 he told reporters questioning him about drilling near FL - "If there's oil down there, we have to figure out how we can drill for it."
617 2018-01-09 22:49:54 NNPC rep have lied many times. None of NNPC stations are dispensing fuel and they were to break  jinx of private oil marketers.
618 2018-01-09 22:49:54 You know, it is truly tragic that ANYONE believed this lying ass snake oil salesman, chump. What happened to plain old common sense?

626 2018-01-09 22:47:57 So happy with the banning of micro beads. That shiz is nasty for yo’ face and poisoning the planet . Find a natural solution like coffee, salt with a bit of cocounut oil! Natural things make everyone happy 
627 2018-01-09 22:47:31 I agree. GOP also killed the oil co tax that would pay for cleanup in tge event of a new disaster. So this just gets worse and worse.  Keep fighting please and let us know how we can help.
628 2018-01-09 22:47:25 Florida's beaches need protection against GOP big money. What stupidity person than big money wants to destroy the Atlantic Ocean. Leaks happen on all oil rigs. Look up the facts not the money in your bank account. Move to Iran.
629 2018-01-09 22:47:15 Holy shit is that really all it is? I coulda sworn I had more time  I need to get my oil changed ASAP apparently hahahaha. I’m so excited to see everyone 
630 2018-01-09 22:47:09 You might consider, that if you fight against oil production, you'd better buy a horse and wagon and plenty of hay, and horses need water, a barn, a pasture, Curry Combs, Bridle saddle, or harnesses and wagon. Leave well enough alone!
631 2018-01-09 22:46:52 I have the edges of a jigsaw puzzle done, I have a yoga membership, I bought a state park pass, I have 3 books checked out from the public library, and I’m starting an oil painting. Now if anyone knows where I can find a stable bank account I think I’m ready for retirement life.
632 2018-01-09 22:46:42 How do we know that there isn’t oil underneath that park?
633 2018-01-09 22:46:41 I just came out the hospital with the taste on the tip of my tongue of their vinegar and oil mix and nope CLOSED! @BlimpieSubShop
634 2018-01-09 22:46:33 love to see how a poor family pays for  healthcare ..food ...gas ..oil ..yep Rosanne got her big tax cut because she is part of the 1 percent ...lets see how that works on her sitcom ..going to be interesting
635 2018-01-09 22:46:20 His monthly prescription costs me $750 out of pocket each month. Pharmaceutical companies are crooks. Since starting the CBD oil (only a tiny percent of THC in it and can’t get high from it) he averages maybe 1 seizure every 2 weeks. Sometimes once a week. Better than 10 daily
636 2018-01-09 22:46:08 Put Coconut Oil on ya girl’s booty before sex, thank me later.
637 2018-01-09 22:45:57 I would like to get more info about your situation regarding pills/oil. My 12 yr old son (epilepsy) is on pills and CBD oil and we think the pills may be doing more harm the good.
638 2018-01-09 22:45:54 อยากนอนต่อ
639 2018-01-09 22:45:53 I’ve had he americano and the vanilla latte. Both today lol. It’s lit. Def better than the usual fried car oil.
640 2018-01-09 22:45:35 Go for it Michael!   If Trump wants. T let his oil buddies destroy costal environment that the avg American can now enjoy then make sure he gets some negative results effecting him.  Why do we want to have so much oil.   Stop the environment destroyer and wafter poisoner.
641 2018-01-09 22:45:26 เอ็นดู แม่โตแล้วนะคะ ^^ดูแลตัวเองได้สิ
642 2018-01-09 22:45:23 Went town and forget to get coconut oil kmt
643 2018-01-09 22:45:02 Oil currency is a non-starter because: (a) depleting (up against secular decline in EROEI); (b) not homogeneous (any number of grades/qualities); (c) limited user base (ie refiners & generators) (d) absence of global legal framework for secure issuance, clearing & settlement
644 2018-01-09 22:44:59 @claycooleygroup i hate you. If you don’t know how to do an oil change don’t run a service station. I don’t remember a vehicle service taking 8 hours.
645 2018-01-09 22:44:54 Après moi un truc qui marche bien c'est la mythic oil de L'Oréal
646 2018-01-09 22:44:48 Cancer council and doctors will fool ya and say otherwise but- people are waking up to the 'Cancer charity scammers' and exploring real cures such as cannabis oil and black salve. #MedicalMarijuana #cannabisoil #cannabisoilkillscancercells
647 2018-01-09 22:44:42 They do mostly all suck. Almost all of them are weak and bought off & allow big pharma, oil, and the military industrial complex to fuck over our people.
648 2018-01-09 22:44:35 I’m so happy i get free oil changes for life on my car 
649 2018-01-09 22:44:27 Thank you ! And yes do try olive oil !!! If u want any help I can inbox you recipes etc 
650 2018-01-09 22:44:20 Prison time in any fashion for weed is stupid. My opinion changed once my son was born with epilepsy and averaged 6-10 seizures daily at one point. We have to drive to Colorado every 6 months to purchase CBD oil. Legal in OK now, but federally it isn’t so can’t mail it.
651 2018-01-09 22:44:14 So we can expect oil drilling to commence in the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historical Park when...next week?
652 2018-01-09 22:44:10 You do realise you've got all your success from oil money.....whilst our club has earnt our money
653 2018-01-09 22:44:04 @jimcramer are you going to bash $mu tonight and tomorrow too?  Snake oil salesman these days...
654 2018-01-09 22:44:04 This is great! Thanks so much.

Oil obviously US dollars. Gas is $US/ mmbtu?
655 2018-01-09 22:43:59 Well your a sham artist selling snake oil.
656 2018-01-09 22:43:59 EZ shares +0.2%, US shares +0.1%. US 10 yr yld +7bp to 2.54% as global bond sell off continues (on good data and overreact to BoJ reducing long bond buying). Oil +2.8% to 63.5. Iron ore +1.4% to $77. ASX futures +0.4%. $A 0.7821
657 2018-01-09 22:43:48 I made a hair mask out of things I could find around the house like aloe and olive oil and egg whites and coconut oil and now my hair is super soft and really shiny 
658 2018-01-09 22:43:47 it resembles motor oil, too.
659 2018-01-09 22:43:40 Until the oil runs out
660 2018-01-09 22:43:32 I heard of you hot oil your hair in the Winter it really helps with the damage!!
661 2018-01-09 22:43:05 This why I go to Walmart for oil changes, shxt expensive 
662 2018-01-09 22:42:56 Right, I'm going to try olive oil in my next crumble - it won't look as good as yours though.
663 2018-01-09 22:42:20 Have you tried peppermint oil? 
Put a few drops into jojoba or some other carrier oil. If your skin is cracked, test it to make sure it won't sting/burn.
It works for me when my legs are itchy.
Have you tried Shea butter for the dry skin?
Hope you get relief from the itching.
664 2018-01-09 22:42:05 I love those shitty, stale, soggy with oil tacos from Jack in the Box
665 2018-01-09 22:42:01 How about reduce our dependence on oil/gasoline first? Blanket statements like "We must stop it." pander to mob mentality and wash over the complexity of energy policy.
666 2018-01-09 22:41:54 Ruski or just Big Oil Money?  Not much difference anymore.
667 2018-01-09 22:41:52 This oil diffuser is awesome and one of the best Christmas gifts I've ever gotten lmao
668 2018-01-09 22:41:38 Must not be any oil there...
669 2018-01-09 22:41:36 What exactly are you using? Macadamia nut oil? Coconut oil?
670 2018-01-09 22:41:32 i use frank coffee scrub and rosehip oil and i don't have good skin so can't help sorry
671 2018-01-09 22:41:32 snake oil sellers white house & all.
672 2018-01-09 22:41:31 Or you could be out of touch! We have more energy above ground than below and the ignorant oil companies will screw this up, and out tourism and natural habitats with it.
673 2018-01-09 22:41:27 Was a lovely bike, 1150 RS was the first of the new breed of oil head boxers after the airheads went extinct, tho low bars gave me back ache. Dream ride is a hard shout. Prob go for either BMW K1300, fully kitted out FJR1300 or Pan European as they are all sweeeeet
674 2018-01-09 22:40:50 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
675 2018-01-09 22:40:30 Dude... Aunt Maggie’s is playing Buena Vista Social Club in FULL and it is going off! GET down here. I’m sipping ‘buchas in the flaxseed oil aisle. Come say hi.
676 2018-01-09 22:40:24 Motorists advised to use HWY 166 to get to the "Island of Montecitio" us EXTREME CAUTION- since the Refugio oil spill & Gaviota Pipeline has been shut down - ALL the oil is now being transported in Tanker trucks - both ways- on HWY 166 to 5 Freeway. #CAstorm #ThomasFire
677 2018-01-09 22:40:22 …ぐぅ
678 2018-01-09 22:40:15 Maybe it wasn't Trump that allowed the oil spill. Because of all the illegal immigrants, lack of water, pedophiles and sex offenders, Etc., maybe God's the one that allowed it!

688 2018-01-09 22:38:47 Shea butter x honey x coconut oil. Kaish. Sounds like greaseville. Already my face is oily af. Even the coconut oil alone makes my face oily within minutes 
689 2018-01-09 22:38:25 You're not going to dig for oil there
690 2018-01-09 22:38:06 An Upper Area Court sitting in Masaka, Nasarawa State, on Tuesday sentenced a 21-year-old student, Sunday Anthony, to nine months imprisonment for stealing a bottle of palm oil.
691 2018-01-09 22:38:02 Fighting for your farmers? Than stop fucking up the environment by polluting it through oil drilling, pipelines and dangerous mining.
692 2018-01-09 22:37:49 So you’re okay with oil platform fires burning out of control & millions of gallons of oil spilling & destroying our oceans??? An”accident” like this happening is NOT slim, but a certainty.Take a look at the Chinese tanker ablaze NOW. They’re waiting for this tanker to explode.
693 2018-01-09 22:37:42 BUSH MEANS, TRUMP IS NOT ON SAUDI OIL PAYROLL.
694 2018-01-09 22:37:40 What? No oil there, I guess.
695 2018-01-09 22:37:37 Bit unconvincing, specially Iran was the first country to exploit the discovery of oil in ME rest followed few decades later. Interesting discussion.
696 2018-01-09 22:37:21 Finally remembered to get more coconut oil while I was out... 
697 2018-01-09 22:37:21 Lmao maybe I should just start selling overpriced coconut oil and plastic knockers to upper class white folks so I can cash out too
698 2018-01-09 22:37:19 okay so ! add 2 tbsp soy sauce, cayenne pepper, black pepper & salt into a freezer bag, cut up ur tofu and put it in the bag to let it marinade w/ the sauce. after letting it marinate for 10 mins fry it in a tbsp of hot oil until golden brown and voila ! it is done !!
699 2018-01-09 22:37:10 IT was horrible. I felt horrible for all those families. Many of these towns being totally ruined are supporters of Trump & his pollution policies. Trump & Congress just killed clean up fund for oil spills. see Rachael Maddow show on that, I think maybe yesterday or show before.

702 2018-01-09 22:36:59 *actually has to do a real assignment* *puts on fuzzy socks* *gets comfort blanket* *diffuses some lavender oil* *tweets about it to procrastinate from doing her actual assignment*
703 2018-01-09 22:36:56 has anyone used coconut oil to define their curls instead of gel? how does it work out for you?
704 2018-01-09 22:36:42 Uh... On an oil rig? Great business plan, Callie.
705 2018-01-09 22:36:40 That fancy boy inherited billions from his oil tycoon parents. He makes loud shirts as his job. He did not earn a goddamn thing, but under your logic he's better than a nurse or construction worker because he has more money.
706 2018-01-09 22:36:37 The dislocation between many of these energy service names and the price of oil just continues to widen. Something has to give...
707 2018-01-09 22:36:23 Oh come on! Your actions speak louder than your words or your tweets. Big Oil owns you and by your vote on the #GOPTaxScam you proved what we already suspected.
The GOP is the Party of the Rich, by the Rich and for the Rich. So quit trying to BS us!
708 2018-01-09 22:36:14 Has anyone yet answered the question, to whom was the oil being delivered??
709 2018-01-09 22:36:10 Give me a lead to her for my guy,we all gonna like d outcome like mashaAllah,plus in between me n u can also u know...
InshaAllah
710 2018-01-09 22:36:01 I need a back massage Yung. Like with the oil an shit  #WishfulThinking
711 2018-01-09 22:35:42 @thehill @realDonaldTrump Absolutely NO to drilling for oil in gulf!!!!!. Please retweet if you agree.
712 2018-01-09 22:35:40 Change oil

714 2018-01-09 22:35:20 They want all of the poor and middle class to die in soon so they're precious oil can be used for only their needs I'm serious that's what they want the rich GOP and all the other Millionaires and billionaires that are funding these regulation Cuts that's what they want
715 2018-01-09 22:35:11 Lol. I was going to offer to oil ya scalp, but FOH.
716 2018-01-09 22:34:58 Try oil tankers full of money
717 2018-01-09 22:34:51 I always wanted some dead human oil and we said cannabis oil
718 2018-01-09 22:34:39 i cant fucking breathe my nigga like omg im soaked up in eucalyptus oil and im still struggling
719 2018-01-09 22:34:33 yeah, right,  Congress is "so concerned" about human rights in a country that JUST HAPPENS to "sit on a sea of oil."    When do we start sending them love bombs?
720 2018-01-09 22:34:28 Machine oil
721 2018-01-09 22:34:28 Maybe all this salt will wash all the oil out of the Jones Falls
722 2018-01-09 22:34:18 Where’s the variety, the treats, the oil 
723 2018-01-09 22:34:02 Older cars with conventional oil yes 3/mo or 3000mi. Synthetic is upwards of 15000 between changes
724 2018-01-09 22:33:59 あっちの方っては知ってた
725 2018-01-09 22:33:51 Just did my take on *Greek Orzo with Tomatoes & Feta* ... was craving Greek for some reason in today's rainstorm.  Tweaked it w/ braised marinated artichoke hearts + organic black beans.  Topped it off w/ torn fresh mint leaves + drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. #SoGood 
726 2018-01-09 22:33:40 The UK just needs one big puff of olbas oil
727 2018-01-09 22:33:26 Jamaican black castor oil can reallyyyyy help yall edges grow! You welcome 
728 2018-01-09 22:33:08 M. Lundle you have missed the point.  When an oil company pollutes a farm they should pay the farmer.  That is what the LLC is for.  Too many oil companies polluted the land and then skipped out without paying.  Then the taxpayers and the farmer get stuck with the bill
729 2018-01-09 22:33:06 The lovely wife is home tonight. She took off and is currently cooking some fried pork chops and red beans & rice...i was really excited until I heard..."all cooked in healthy oil"..........
730 2018-01-09 22:32:55 One of my pals was using their diffusers and the lavender oil as well as eucalyptus, and said that her cat got sick because of it and now I’m worried 
731 2018-01-09 22:32:42 Admitting to climate change on a mass scale means reducing the use of natural resources, the big companies will lose out on their billions if this happens...deny the level of climate change, keep using oil and gas, keep the money flowing.
732 2018-01-09 22:32:38 OPEC is a cartel for the benifit of the oil producers. The gold market is a cartel also. It's just not for the benifit of the gold industry or producers.
733 2018-01-09 22:32:36 But it isn't needed. We have more than enough oil - we export it, as well. My coastline is a mess from years of drilling. Do you want the CA coast looking like the MS/LA coast? And killing off fishing businesses? Ppl here have lost everything due to their business dying from that
734 2018-01-09 22:32:26 Coconut oil. Definitely coconut oil.
735 2018-01-09 22:32:21 well if the Russians can't drill in the antarctic...they'll take the florida coast oil...is why they're pushing DeSantis and giving him money??
736 2018-01-09 22:32:18 I assume snake oil is not a good lubricate.
737 2018-01-09 22:32:16 Got my oil and diffuser in mail...
738 2018-01-09 22:31:59 The last I checked your government is still sucking our oil dry... Get a life
739 2018-01-09 22:31:54 I need a man... just so I don’t have to take my car to get washed and to get an oil change

741 2018-01-09 22:31:42 The 1969, when you were 5 yrs old, oil spill sparked laws and regulations. So why oil spills in 1988, 1990. 2007 and 2015? Was this another Obama promise? How many promises can you invent to limit economic growth?
742 2018-01-09 22:31:34 I was just reading about Rockefeller buying up failed oil leases in PA in the late 1800s
743 2018-01-09 22:31:25 There's no political solution to it! How did they end IPOB agitation,Militancy in the NigerDelta,Oil theft and crimes in the SouthWest?
744 2018-01-09 22:31:04 I never believed Nigeria was that hard until, i saw my friend eating Bread with "Anointing oil" #bread #anointing #oil
745 2018-01-09 22:31:03 got rose hip oil in my eye and now I’m scared that I’m going to die in my sleep
746 2018-01-09 22:31:01 OIL DIFF: 6.03 -> 6.03
747 2018-01-09 22:30:57 Hi Chris, maybe this is obvious, but do you think the manipulation of oil prices was politically motivated, ie. a US/Obama/Saudis attack on other oil producers like Russia, Iran, Venezuela? The impact on their economy has been significant from 2014. Any source online? Thanks!
748 2018-01-09 22:30:55 Had to get a good look for the oil painting he's making tonight.
749 2018-01-09 22:30:53 It gets dry and starts to cake off and fall in my eyes. But beauty is pain or?. Oh I was off with warm water and moisturize with coconut oil.
750 2018-01-09 22:30:48 Felt like whoever changed my oil deserved a tip.. but they looked at me crazy when I tried 
751 2018-01-09 22:30:29 #HouseOfSaud the chaos that is the middle east seems to boil down to my Islam is better than yours: Sunni/Shia, Saudi/Iran. Real winners are the Western arms manufacturers. As we are reliant on Saudi oil this could go on for decades. #SolutionsPlease?
752 2018-01-09 22:30:28 Yes but these people will cheer not drilling off of THEIR coast while still demanding oil/petroleum based products made from destroying OUR coastline.

I'm happy drilling isn't being expanded but I see NO vows to stop using so much oil/petroleum products so our coast might revive
753 2018-01-09 22:30:27 Glad Susie could take a minute off from positioning oil wells off the Maine coast.
754 2018-01-09 22:30:23 Dont forget to oil up that beard young kings.
755 2018-01-09 22:30:15 Oh, I see your problem. You need a drop of WD-40 oil applied to the #8 key pivot pin to free up that striker. Hope that helps. FB for more helpful tips!
756 2018-01-09 22:30:14 We've got an essential oil diffuser in our living room and it's so nice I really want one for the bedroom/office too
757 2018-01-09 22:30:12 OIL DIFF: 5.94 -> 6.06
758 2018-01-09 22:30:10 Esa es una de las razones por la cual sus inventos fueron confiscados y aun son secretos.  Su contradictor era Rockefeller Standard Oil y energía gratuita amenazaba la industria del petróleo
759 2018-01-09 22:30:04 i got an oil change and tire rotation fort car today so i feel that i have successfully adulted
760 2018-01-09 22:29:42 $20 oil changes, thank god for my papa
761 2018-01-09 22:29:34 Finally took my car for a carwash, cleaned my car out and made an appointment for my overdue oil change, totally feeling like an accomplished adult 
762 2018-01-09 22:29:32 the risks ARE far too high.. and we don't need the oil.. I agree, but some people, who willl remain un-named are pre-occupied and fixated on oil. and money and greed
763 2018-01-09 22:29:29 The oil price crashed & we would now be bankrupt.
764 2018-01-09 22:29:25 Oil prices closed at fresh three-year highs Tuesday, as geopolitical risk and confidence in global growth continued to buoy markets.
765 2018-01-09 22:29:19 Michael Moore drilling for oil in full view of trumps precious golf course is utter genius.
766 2018-01-09 22:29:12 After a bunch of Shania Twainiacs came around last bracket and helped beat Midnight Oil and Frank Sinatra albums, I’m not convinced in any wins til last three hours.
767 2018-01-09 22:29:09 Thanks Weed N Oil for the follow!
768 2018-01-09 22:28:50 Ok I am way too old for it now but my 18 year old self misses oil city (@kasseym  those were the days)
769 2018-01-09 22:28:47 I remember one midwestern town I saw pictures of that had Tar Sands oil flood their beautiful neighborhood. It looked like a flood but the flood was pure black oil that flooded the entire neighborhood over first floor of most of the houses. Drinking water ruined, land worthless.
770 2018-01-09 22:28:26 Your the idiots letting yourselves be divided and controlled by the west when we've had all your oil it will be over in a instant we won't look back
771 2018-01-09 22:28:21 Has everyone forgotten that diesel engines can run perfectly well on vegetable oil?
the reason it hasn't become popular is the fuel duty imposed by the government that are trying to protect us? yea lets go with that one shall we...#corruptionkillsmorethanfumes

774 2018-01-09 22:28:00 Thanks for your order! Have fun playing with your SPUNK Lube Hybrid. i also have @SpunkLube Natural made of organic avocado oil and organic virgin coconut oil so no need anymore for baby oil/olive oil. Also SPUNK Lube Pure Silicone is clear & non drying..
775 2018-01-09 22:27:53 Please explain why you cleaned the le man winner I did the lighting when it went to the park lane showroom and it still had dirt oil and crack in windscreen  leave it alone  it tells its own story
776 2018-01-09 22:27:53 .@SenFeinstein: Expanding offshore oil drilling is another short-sighted, terrible idea from the Trump administration. The risks are far too high, the environmental damage would be irreversible and we don’t need the oil. Let’s make sure this never happens!
777 2018-01-09 22:27:53 The wheels of the sex addiction industry are greased with snake oil. (Which is not environmentally sound, feminist, or affirmative, in case you were wondering)
778 2018-01-09 22:27:45 Must not be any oil under it.

you should be feeling verrry relaxed right about............now!
785 2018-01-09 22:26:52 Everything relating to immigration programs are abused and falsified in a way that would embarrass those protecting entitlement programs from fraud. Nothing on earth has been abused more - not even the old Iraqi oil for food program.
786 2018-01-09 22:26:51 Only because there’s no oil under this site, huh?
787 2018-01-09 22:26:48 It's better when it's an oil tank with the top and bottom cut off. And it's full of tires. That gets warm.
788 2018-01-09 22:26:43 So when they find oil on this site will you sell it?
789 2018-01-09 22:26:13 Oil is pushing $64...... watch the signs folks!!  Interest rates will continue to climb as the economy rebounds....
790 2018-01-09 22:26:12 Debating on getting some co2 oil cartdriges for anxiety and insomnia while I'm in Cali 
791 2018-01-09 22:25:55 @GoogleTravel there should be a feature, which allows me to find cheapest flight for a given country/period. for example send me an alert when you find cheapest price for: CLT-HYD 2 weeks trip, anytime between Apr-Aug, for 1 person.
792 2018-01-09 22:25:44 Oil is up to nearly 70.00 dollars a barrel. The Yoons said oil would never rise again, or would be in the doldrums for years. They said Scotland was too poor to become independent. They said Scotland Is dependent on WMs goodwill. When we all know WM is dependent on Scotland's oil

795 2018-01-09 22:25:29 Until you find oil or nat gas, then all bets are off
796 2018-01-09 22:25:28 for decades, theres been no way to vote against war, big oil, fracking, &Wall Street by both parties, half the population is poor or poverty in richest country on Earth & you dont think thats on purpose?
797 2018-01-09 22:25:18 Long soak in hot tub + lavender and eucalyptus oil in burner + Norah Jones = Bliss..... 
798 2018-01-09 22:25:14 Wok oil is a godsend
799 2018-01-09 22:25:12 This lemongrass essential oil smells like poopouri, which reminds me of poop, so that’s gonna be a no from me.
800 2018-01-09 22:25:11 First, try making changes to use less oil/petroleum based products & support green energy. They're still drilling off the coast of MY home because of demand. And things here get ruined. If you all don't want it, what makes you think we like it here on the gulf, either?
801 2018-01-09 22:25:10 You and your friend you're asking for nee fresh oil for the year. Clear the rusts of 2017 sis
802 2018-01-09 22:25:08 It's a scheme to raise capital. The government is desperate for cash flow. Oil production is down to 1.7 mbpd.

806 2018-01-09 22:23:43 Eh, it still has eucalyptus oil in it which you aren’t supposed to use on babies under 2 years old. But if anything, especially not on the chest.
807 2018-01-09 22:23:39 Tea tree oil and lemon!

812 2018-01-09 22:22:47 I rinse my mouth with coconut oil when I get those and they’re gone in a few days!
813 2018-01-09 22:22:44 Lmao went to go get my oil changed and the workers talking about how my car damn near gave them the munchies just being in it 
814 2018-01-09 22:22:23 Very very interesting documentary. Saudi Arabia has callously exploited the West's need for oil and trade, to push through a fundamentalist agenda, which for any other country, would have been suicidal. Very soon, the chickens will roost. They are already home #houseofsaud
815 2018-01-09 22:22:22 Oil is up almost the percent of buttermilk now: I hope the market closes before I have to write a buttermilk joke
816 2018-01-09 22:22:11 Eucalyptus oil and a paint scraper my dude
817 2018-01-09 22:21:55 Trump's a con man.For some reason nobody could see that a year ago. Y'all need to look at what they did yesterday concerning oil drilling and emergency and safety regulations. Better wake up folks. We're running out of time.
818 2018-01-09 22:21:49 A promoted political tweet? I am 100% supportive of off shore drilling. America drilling for its own oil instead of paying the Middle East or Venezuela billions is worth the risk of oil spills. I bet you’re probably the special kind of person who will vote for Oprah if she ran.
819 2018-01-09 22:21:35 Now you've gone all extreme again. How right is it to put all those orangutans and rain forest creatures out of their homes in aid of palm oil plantations? We don't "just go along and shoot things in the head". You are being ridiculous.

822 2018-01-09 22:21:20 Think oil red 13 to sell tomorrow if closes up on the weekly. $uso #OOTT
823 2018-01-09 22:21:02 We should stop buying oil from Saudi Arabia. We should invest in renewable energy and dispense with the need for fossil fuels as fast as possible.
824 2018-01-09 22:20:48 And maybe oil drilling!
825 2018-01-09 22:20:40 Yeah me too. Considering the lack of prospects the Oil have in the A, some of the homegrown guys we let walk are questionable. #Oesterle #Pitlick

839 2018-01-09 22:18:59 Kind of depends on the car. Some cars are good for 5-6k+ without much trouble, but turbocharged cars for example, which also use the same oil, should be changed every 3k.

841 2018-01-09 22:18:49 Everyone raging with this company for fracking. But Scottish government actively wants North Sea oil drilling/investment- not very environmentally friendly!
Do what happens in the USA - people get paid for any fracking under their property. Everyone will be happy then I bet.

847 2018-01-09 22:18:15 Let's hope so. Our air, water & land can't afford any more polution, oil spills & pipeline leaks that have ruined whole neighborhoods. Tar Sands Oil can't be cleaned up. We don't have the technology to clean that kind of oil as it sinks, not floats.
848 2018-01-09 22:18:06 Will 'Stinky Zinke'  be drilling oil on it next week?

869 2018-01-09 22:16:05 Not forgetting that at...if I could I'd like to see this country end all sales to Saudi, source oil elsewhere, ban Saudi funded Mosque's and schools in the UK. Your right it is blood money. Pain and simple
870 2018-01-09 22:16:05 We buy oil from them.
871 2018-01-09 22:16:03 But those oil rigs are so pretty lit up at night

879 2018-01-09 22:14:50 Could be. If that's the case, oh boy. It'll be a headache before our drop. Dumb money showed itself today. There are probably a few money managers who must have had a sigh of relief today. That we get EIA news of 10 million US Oil, and they get to sell here.
880 2018-01-09 22:14:48 I wonder who's suppressing it umm . And let's not forget the more mosques in the west the more donations back to Saudi after the oil runs out

906 2018-01-09 22:12:57 He did so for 2 reasons.
1. It benefits his oil industry buddies.
2. The regs were Obama era regs. He's obsessed with ending everything associated with Obama!
907 2018-01-09 22:12:56 Saudi oil companies are invested in Myanmar oil fields. Willfully ignoring  persecution of the Rohingya. Saudi’s Aramco signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to supply China 200,000 barrels of crude a day through the China-Myanmar pipeline.

918 2018-01-09 22:11:50 Dear president Trump.
The excessive cost to repaving our streets and highways with asphalt is directly affected by the high cost of purchasing foreign oil.
It's one thing to help other nations by making economic purchases of oil, yet another to suppress our oil industry via it.
919 2018-01-09 22:11:47 Oh, I'm scared now! 
Another snake oil grifter.
920 2018-01-09 22:11:38 And that's a weirdly xenophobic distinction to make. "Sorry, person from a country we handed to dictators for oil. Yes, a person who wants to bomb you and prevent you from reaching safe haven is running, but you don't get to talk about it!"

Also, when the grid efficiency is improved 1% everyone benefits. When ICE efficiency is improved only new adopters benefit, etc...

949 2018-01-09 22:08:17 Sitting in the car dealership waiting for them to finish my oil change. Trapped like a rat.
950 2018-01-09 22:08:14 Will we be drilling oil on that national site like you want to have happen on others?
951 2018-01-09 22:08:05 Go to work to get my charger and end up leaving 40 mins later covered in oil after making the fattest mess possible
952 2018-01-09 22:08:00 Besides, the oil companies pretty much are in trouble on their own. Even with the unlimited drilling they just got, the level of oil is still going reach peak by the mid-30's at best and start downward.
953 2018-01-09 22:07:57 #HouseOfSaud Not surprising that the Saudi’s didn’t comment  There’s nobody in the world to hold them to account for their failings and wrong doings. If anybody tries, they’ll turn the oil tap off

958 2018-01-09 22:07:36 Of course we can. The stuff sourrounding us demands oil derivates, not just fuels.

965 2018-01-09 22:06:56 Definitely a possibility but boy has it been raining ....if I am so be it.... But miners are already big green for me and oil should follow .... Hope you have an awesome night Bally

978 2018-01-09 22:05:21 I have long argued that the hydrogen economy was a red herring proposed by the oil and gas industry to delay (nearly infinitely) the transition away from fossil fuels due to H2 cost, leakage, embrittlement and storage/transport issues.  It will NEVER happen.
979 2018-01-09 22:05:21 also no on the butter, olive oil and garlic powder sure tho

993 2018-01-09 22:04:04 New tires, an oil change, a full tank of gas and a car wash. The Fiat is looking pretty dapper.

995 2018-01-09 22:03:49 Senator Feinstein, don’t you think it is a good idea to be energy independent and get the heck out of the middle east oil game? We are a independent nation that does not need to mess with the Middle East over oil.
996 2018-01-09 22:03:46 Some lady said she's so sensitive to gluten she couldn't have French fries because we fry falafel in the same oil. But then she ordered the rice even though I explicitly told her the rice is NOT gluten free because it's Greek rice so it has pasta in it. SO WHICH IS IT LADY

1135 2018-01-09 21:58:34 I use a combination of stuff from The Body Shop. Their Vitamin E line is good for dry skin, I use that in the winter in combination with their Seaweed face cream and Tea Tree line. I’d also suggest Rosehip Oil, it’s relatively cheap on Amazon.
1136 2018-01-09 21:58:10 And they also passed regulations that allow for more off shore drilling with less safeguards.  So at least we can better monitor the next oil spill in the ocean.

1150 2018-01-09 21:56:32 We all know very well that we're not seeing an 11+ million crude draw tomorrow. The problem is there is plenty of money in right now that isn't regular oil money. They don't know about API and EIA differences, and they're distorting the price because they're dumb.

1171 2018-01-09 21:53:47 @ChefTomKerridge couple of q's if you don't mind.. read that olive oil is not good for cooking with what's your opinion?  Why do you start boiling potatoes in cold water? I thought sweeteners had nasty side effects is this not the case?

1175 2018-01-09 21:53:14 Have you gone completely crazy?
Yes we need the oil! You crazy old ass bat! 
Gas prices are outfucking -ragous.
Yes, we do need the oil on the market.  We also need to devolope solutions that are viable option for Americans to get off oil. Thats not going to be today.

1177 2018-01-09 21:52:34 Well that's delightful.. are you going to take it back next week when Exxon wants to drill for oil or they find uranium deposits in Georgia?
1178 2018-01-09 21:52:24 The government saying you cant have private ownership of it. It isn't a horrible failure since the value  oil prices is set by a global market based on a free market system but people wouldn't have innovated to the point of oil having value if not for the markets to begin with.

1325 2018-01-09 21:38:20 The little API spike is pretty much telling me that the euphoria is alive, and that any excuse is given to get the price higher. That kind of euphoria usually means bad news for bulls.

1398 2018-01-09 21:31:33 Oil rich countries with progressive stable democracies, competent government and a highly educated workforce tend to get plenty of investment, yes. UK is an absolute basket case in case you haven't noticed

1401 2018-01-09 21:31:16 Been reading about & saying this for years - forget Russia, North Korea, Trump, etc. Saudi Arabia have been the axis of evil and at the heart of a large % of the world's terrorism problems for decades (£££). Yet they have oil & like to buy big guns, so it's all fine. #HouseOfSaud
1402 2018-01-09 21:31:16 My favorite mechanics of all time and place sold their business, probably for huge money, I hope (Union Square Gulf).  Forced to have oil changed at one of those instant places where they have to check their records for my name. Best to you, Greg and Jim. I'll miss you!
1403 2018-01-09 21:31:05 I agree with you. Also the next global recovery cycle will be much more industrially driven than any we've seen since the 1970's. World oil demand will be much higher than anyone is anticipating.
1404 2018-01-09 21:30:59 Not just labour prices. Day rates for equipment along with increased activity. Higher input costs such as sand, fuel, water etc. Oil price will cover that for a bit, but someone has to pay or the work doesn't get done.

1407 2018-01-09 21:30:42 Nope. We keep taking oil and minerals from the ground due to capitalism. The albino mutants will end earth.

1413 2018-01-09 21:30:24 the stream gets them to this side of the ocean and not Africa, obviously. What's the matter with gp scientists nowadays? not enough oil companies funding?

1416 2018-01-09 21:30:14 How long until you try and open it up to oil drilling?  #TwoFaceTrump
1417 2018-01-09 21:30:10 YES. Tillerson was awarded Russia's Order of Friendship Medal by Vladimir Putin in 2013 after ExxonMobil struck a deal with State-owned oil giant Rosneft in 1999. Tillerson was CEO of ExxonMobil before becoming President Trump's Secretary of State.
1418 2018-01-09 21:30:08 Unless shale producers prove themselves to be disciplined operators  (will continue to not outspend cashflow in 2018) I don’t think meaningful capital will flow into the energy space. Hence this huge discrepancy between oil price and oil equities. #OOTT $WPX $OAS $CJ.To $SPE.TO
1419 2018-01-09 21:30:04 The idea that olive oil is as carbon intensive or as detrimental to biodiversity as palm oil is flat-out incorrect.
1420 2018-01-09 21:29:59 Exactly. He signed that today so he can claim drilling rights on it next week. They can look for oil derricks soon.
1421 2018-01-09 21:29:53 Left a retail outlet with just earbuds and a bottle of olive oil purchased late capitalism is so bizarre
1422 2018-01-09 21:29:50 So y’all remember I got my oil changed so why I’m just checking it & it has 8% 
1423 2018-01-09 21:29:30 @subaru_usa your dealer @LibertyAutoCity lied to me telling me @jiffylube cost more for an oil change of my #Subaru 2017 Outback! @jiffylube charge was $84 for 100% synthetic! Want to know why your dealer loses biz? This is why. Lies and noncompetitive rates!
1424 2018-01-09 21:29:28 If I am not mistaken aren’t oil drills being installed in the Great Lakes too?
1425 2018-01-09 21:29:23 #houseofsaud use money to propagate hatred.                                      We need oil                                    They sell oil.                                     We need to stop needing oil.
1426 2018-01-09 21:29:19 Blaze is crazy fun, he really brings the heat! @BlizzHeroes
1427 2018-01-09 21:29:09 It's meaningless if folks then go off and vote to drill for oil in the Arctic and along our coasts. We don't have time for a #climate #figleaf.
1428 2018-01-09 21:29:02 Oga! Stay on the issue! NNPC like CBN has the power to subsidize any activity it deems appropriate! It is a commercial venture, I hope you know? Good thing: NNPC is not owing any oil importer fuel subsidy!
1429 2018-01-09 21:28:58 Trump may try to re-impose sanctions on Iran. Guess what will happen after that? #petroYuan That's right! Russia and Iran will enable Yuan contracts to sell #oil to China. This will see the #USD lose value and guess what, not just $BTC, every #shitcoin will moon then. Just #HODL
1430 2018-01-09 21:28:54 Awesome thank you because I really love the shampoo itself but I want to switch to the shampoo bars. I’ve been switching every other day with I Love Juicy and Jason and The Argon Oil

1436 2018-01-09 21:28:34 Thx for the link. The odd thing about the majority of the Christian church is that they, for some unknown reason, see God's "Good" gift of coal, oil & gas in creation, as 'bad', & that they can control climate. God calls this foolishness. Do you see where where in coming from?
1437 2018-01-09 21:28:21 XLE/Oil ration coming more in-line as of today  was the last piece of the puzzle IMO
1438 2018-01-09 21:28:20 почему такая гордость из-за того, что я понимаю эти названия? Я пересмотрела хауса
1439 2018-01-09 21:28:20 America you made my day Hahahahhaha you imposed sanctions to Russia then you ask them to introduce export ban oil to DPRK @nikkihaley and @realDonaldTrump what levels of your educations
1440 2018-01-09 21:28:13 We wouldn't need to "animate" King St. if the #KingStreetPilot hadn't ruined it in the first place. See the problem here? Throwing oil on a fire? Too late for some businesses that will close their doors well before April! And it's NOT due to the polar vortex.
1441 2018-01-09 21:28:05 Many ways USA can get reimbursed through trade, oil, etc,  so, what are you waiting for??
1442 2018-01-09 21:28:00 Secondly, the definition of wet isn't just relative to water, it's any liquid, a liquid such as oil or paint or any other liquid as a matter of fact can be mixed or covered by another liquid.
1443 2018-01-09 21:27:55 Yes wash the hair w/baby shampoo, then put the olive oil in there, wash it out, then put it back in there & let it stay. Make sure it’s the pure virgin olive oil in the cooking oil section.
1444 2018-01-09 21:27:54 Listening to Triple M and they’re talking about their Aussie song countdown thing on Australia Day and what will be number 1 and all that. And then IMMEDIATELY after they play Beds are Burning by Midnight Oil......
1445 2018-01-09 21:27:53 Oil is often regarded as liquid gold
1446 2018-01-09 21:27:50 Y’all coulda just left it alone or DMed him but since y’all fresh into 2018 and I’m in a dragging mode wetinconcernyou????

1450 2018-01-09 21:27:29 When the guy at the oil change place thinks your cute & constantly asks you on a date. But, on the plus side they were completely booked and he fit me in for an oil change right away 
1451 2018-01-09 21:27:09 I basically have a truck now &not worrying about breaking an oil pan feels so good

1466 2018-01-09 21:24:42 Oh yeah. I make my own chips by par boiling the potato, drain, spray with tiny bit of oil and cover in nooch. Bake in oven and they come out sooooooo crispy 
1467 2018-01-09 21:24:42 Rothchilds bank? Murdoch gets same treatment. Threaten with oil supply if anything said.
1468 2018-01-09 21:24:33 And they got rid the clean up funding with #GOPtaxscam AND Trump eliminated safety regs put in place after BP Deepwater because "they wwztoo hard for poor wittle oil companies to deal with" .@altUSEPA

1470 2018-01-09 21:24:24 You know you’re an adult when you get excited to cash your paycheck cause you’re in desperate need of an oil change
1471 2018-01-09 21:24:22 It's the always messenger. The squeaky wheel gets the oil until it's determined that the vehicle is junk. No glory, just the perp walk out.
1472 2018-01-09 21:24:20 Oil goes up, it could derail OPEC deal. Oil goes down, it could derail OPEC deal.
1473 2018-01-09 21:24:12 Somehow I am still not felling very secure about the Aadhaar card topic. It doesn’t really seem to be full proof when it comes to security of the data. I wonder if India has been the victim of any major cyber hack or even if they are aware of it. Data is the new oil - M Ambani.
1474 2018-01-09 21:23:59 Go ahead and ignore the facts.  Our dependence on oil will DECREASE in the future, sending oil prices tumbling.  This is just a profit grab by the oil industry.
1475 2018-01-09 21:23:58 coconut oil is just making my skin dry at this point.
1476 2018-01-09 21:23:58 AFTERNOON MARKET WATCH: S&P 500, Nasdaq notch all-time highs for 6th day in a row. Dow jumps 103 points to a record. Oil hits 3-year high. ~ M
1477 2018-01-09 21:23:50 #WTI oil settles at $62.96 a barrel U.S - highest since Dec 9, 2014. Unfortunately #Canadian WCS oil can’t reach $38 a barrel.

1481 2018-01-09 21:23:37 @masikakalysha 
Would your hair oil blend make my babies hair grow?
1482 2018-01-09 21:23:31 Are you sure its not oil passing the turbo spindle or maybe a torque converter fault?
1483 2018-01-09 21:23:20 The $400 oil change....
1484 2018-01-09 21:23:16 Maybe try Josie maran argan oil, just get a sample from Sephora and try a small spot on your face to make sure you don't get a reaction. I've been using argan oil lately since my skin has been oddly dry as hell
1485 2018-01-09 21:23:13 There's probably hardly any cheese left when it's melted right? Just oil/grease right? That's the cellulite 
1486 2018-01-09 21:23:01 Besides make derogatory to women and people of color, take away health care from millions, increase oil drilling, and end protection for hundreds of thousands HARD WORKING human beings, and just hypocritical human being in general?
1487 2018-01-09 21:23:01 How long until you reverse that act and sell that space off for oil drilling and fracking?

1494 2018-01-09 21:22:23 #RKH chart looks nice, geared to oil lovely
1495 2018-01-09 21:22:12 We need the oil                      We pay                                 Stop needing the oil
1496 2018-01-09 21:22:10 It actually doesn't. A big reason as to why trump won, besides the russia situation, is because his attraction to the Deep South, and the mid west with his snake oil pitches.
1497 2018-01-09 21:22:04 of the participants — whether it be oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom began, and he was telling me? Isn’t Blazes Boylan presented to 2/4
1498 2018-01-09 21:21:52 You think there was an oil spill in the hotel then?
1499 2018-01-09 21:21:50 Don’t listen to them Ray. I’ll change your oil for $15 no taxes!
1500 2018-01-09 21:21:47 My son has 25-30 tonic clonic #seizures a month. Plz help to get NICE to approve the CBD oil. It would take so much pressure off the #NHS
1501 2018-01-09 21:21:39 Because they’d have to admit they’ve been had by the biggest snake oil salesman ever.
1502 2018-01-09 21:21:33 Gotta oil it up 
1503 2018-01-09 21:21:25 Who up saying the wrong words to the oil bois trying to sound educated on the subject but actually making an absolute Buffoon of myself on the grandest stage of them all, a drive thru oil replacement spot
1504 2018-01-09 21:21:24 How much did your mentor left, did he pay paris club refund? Did he paid contractors? Did he paid oil marketers for subsidies claims? All No
1505 2018-01-09 21:21:18 Yes, I agree, love Oprah but I don't go for an oil change to my dentist office. 

We must remember that we need experience for this position.
1506 2018-01-09 21:21:16 You used coconut oil on ur lashes?! Tell me ur secret oml 
1507 2018-01-09 21:21:15 это выбешивает, но, думаю, ты кайфуешь от этого
1508 2018-01-09 21:21:05 @Chippyelite Once went to a Chippie that cooked in Beef dripping, it was divine but none of the youngsters liked it so they changed back to oil, sometimes the old ways are better
1509 2018-01-09 21:21:05 I better get an oil change this week-end
1510 2018-01-09 21:21:05 He nods as he takes the veggie oil and the measuring cup, pouring the smoking perfectly up to the line. He waited again.
1511 2018-01-09 21:21:02 Yeah it's egg yolks, oil and mustard in it's simplest form. 
1512 2018-01-09 21:20:58 Angola has the world's 17th largest crude oil reserves.
1513 2018-01-09 21:20:57 They should just bring the guy to magazine.  They will saa him grease and dirty oil .
1514 2018-01-09 21:20:57 Pretty excited about the oil diffuser I just purchased.

1516 2018-01-09 21:20:38 Thanks, that was great. We miss you in Utah! Loved Blood and Oil...
1517 2018-01-09 21:20:33 I hope @ashrafghani's spokesman, @Murtazawi3 sees your tweet and stop selling snake oil and fabricating facts.
1518 2018-01-09 21:20:30 Have you lost your mind, Yes you have! The oil is still there laying on the bottom of the ocean polluting, do you even read, no! I can tell that by your sentence structure and your inability to reason.
1519 2018-01-09 21:20:23 World Bank predicts the global economy will grow 3.1% in 2018, alludes to rise in oil prices as reason for stability in FX markets and a decline in core inflation. It however caution on decline in non-oil industrial production in manufacturing and construction.
1520 2018-01-09 21:20:23 I’ve tested with both, but coconut oil is correct. The headnote is a typo. But you can buy coconut oil for like $16 a gallon on Amazon!
1521 2018-01-09 21:20:16 This is a nice photo op but what about Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante? Remember? The national monuments you slashed to allow for oil drilling? Without asking us for permission? Remember that?
1522 2018-01-09 21:20:16 Especially loved learning that tax on oil companies to be used for massive oil spill disasters was cut! The oil companies thank you! #scam
1523 2018-01-09 21:20:16 IRT the "gluten-free" shampoo - I have had celiac flare ups caused by "wheat germ oil" in lip balm and lipstick before. I don't know if wheat germ oil in shampoo would absorb and cause a problem, but I am unwilling to find out.
1524 2018-01-09 21:20:13 You’ve been selling off parkland and just opened every single acre of wildlife preserve in the country to an oil spill disaster. After making war on America’s public parks you do NOT get credit for doing something nice for ONE. If there was oil there you’d have done nothing.
1525 2018-01-09 21:20:08 @AliYoungBeauty Hi Ali, currently using Caudilie hydrating serum under PCMC but need a boost at night.  Do I do oil under serum or serum then oil?

#1) Outpace world GDP by growing 4% annually.

#2) Don't go "back to our complacent ways" in event of another oil boom.
1531 2018-01-09 21:19:11 this whole line is great for help hydrate your hair and it helps with breakage , when I do my deep conditioning I mix it with black castor oil
1532 2018-01-09 21:19:09 I’m hungry, I’m sleepy, and I’m exasperated...why did everyone decide to get an oil change today?! 
1533 2018-01-09 21:19:08 Must not have oil or minerals under it.
1534 2018-01-09 21:18:51 So should you not cook with extra virgin olive oil?
1535 2018-01-09 21:18:47 The end times aren’t popular but they’re real. The more we see it; the more we must talk about being prepared. Oil in your lamps! #Bible
1536 2018-01-09 21:18:44 Oh great, now oil companies can drill there.
1537 2018-01-09 21:18:23 The question is which needs a change more you or the oil xD

1539 2018-01-09 21:18:11 There are some absolute sharks and con men promoting low carb, just as there is for so called cancer cures and other serious health conditions. Does not make all low carb promoters snake oil salesmen.

1541 2018-01-09 21:18:04 People pray for the cake. Then God gives them the batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan, an oven, they get frustrated and leave the kitchen. Let that sink. Sometimes you have everything right in front of you, but how bad do you want it ?

1543 2018-01-09 21:17:57 This is the year my beard finally connects , Jamaican black castor oil is doing the things.
1544 2018-01-09 21:17:55 Wouldn’t it have been easier to support democrats who would never have proposed drilling in offshore Florida, just to provide profits for big oil republican cronies?
1545 2018-01-09 21:17:18 Sit your hot mileage asses down in a warm bath... you want a detox add your favorite oil, some baking soda and bah salt.

1581 2018-01-09 21:13:53 Brent crude at $68/bbl, WTIC pushing $63. Synchronized growth pushing demand. At what price level does this get concering vis-a-vis inflation, interest rates, and overall economic growth? Central banks to have hands forced by oil price?
1582 2018-01-09 21:13:50 Believe me I know that more than anything. Imagine but a cup full of dirt seeps out onto the table. Just so happens there's more dirt in this countries cup than others.

1671 2018-01-09 21:03:17 We can do exactly what u like baby it’s all on me, we can take Vicodin tonight baby it’s all on me, ima have yo body sweating like u dipped in baby oil; In-credible
1672 2018-01-09 21:03:01 So, I guess us taxpayers will be footing the bill for the oil companies??? #bullcrap
1673 2018-01-09 21:02:48 Ha! You get to my age Kellie you need oil for everything. It is the same for humans and old robot sex rats
1674 2018-01-09 21:02:44 How did my girl call him an oil dipped peanut ياويييييلي @Chqqoo
1675 2018-01-09 21:02:35 I use Almond Oil.... I apply it before I go to bed everynight
1676 2018-01-09 21:02:34 Lol ok oil player u some pro or something take from your mother she was a real pro
1677 2018-01-09 21:02:30 Hi Martin. We have recently changed our oil boiler to biomass fuel using wood pellets. It seems that some of the uk suppliers of bagged rather than bulk pellets are price fixing according to one of them who offers lower prices but never delivers. Could there be any truth in this
1678 2018-01-09 21:02:21 that's cause her ex co-writer too busy making coconut oil and starring in love & hip hop 
1679 2018-01-09 21:02:14 Nothing is financially secure. 
Look at Mirror, BHS, Equitable Life, Pension contribution holidays, RPI to CPI, Irish National Pensions reserve fund (raided),Brown’s raid, wound up schemes losing up to 40%,
Pension age increases.
Anyone else selling  oil?
#WASPI
1680 2018-01-09 21:01:56 I went in for a 50$ oil change and imma leave spending at least 300$ 
1681 2018-01-09 21:01:51 Whatever you support, trump is not proceeding in a tolerable manner for it. For example, opening up a wildlife refuge in Alaska for drilling oil that may not even be there? That is incredibly myopic. If trump had vision he would pursue renewable energy development instead.
1682 2018-01-09 21:01:45 An extra soft blanket, sweats, and massage oil.
1683 2018-01-09 21:01:31 i've slipped on almost everything, but never a perfectly placed splash of oil shot from a secret tube affixed to a spy's speeding sports car. pretty big oversight imho
1684 2018-01-09 21:01:22 Lyle, Ray's no oil painting so that's a bit harsh.

1687 2018-01-09 21:01:09 So uhhh pats car had a misfire on 3 cylinders, after further inspection, it became clear that the car burned all of its oil #fml
1688 2018-01-09 21:01:03 I can't put solar on my roof because of location angles, I've tried. Why doesn't the US use a little bit of all energies and call a truce to knocking each other out with one or the other only? We do have over 100 year supply of oil stored. No need for new pipelines or fracking.

1690 2018-01-09 21:00:46 A cold that's lasted for 3 weeks? I prescribed myself Mongolian beef swimming in chili oil. I can't feel my lips, but my throat feels better. :)
1691 2018-01-09 21:00:42 I bought another #A3 but with 1.9 TDI engine, tuned to 170 PS. It was a #demon. But nothing is easy, right? After I decided to change oil and timing belt engine broke. #Camshaft was shredded and damaged all of hydraulic tappets and PD's.
1692 2018-01-09 21:00:39 OIL DIFF: 6.09 -> 6.13
1693 2018-01-09 21:00:39 What a laugh that “They don’t want to buy foreign oil.”  Massive oil companies ARE foreign oil. They ONLY want fewer regulations, full stop.
1694 2018-01-09 21:00:34 Alot of good movement on the commodities today. Nice to see Oil and Nat gas breakout!!!
1695 2018-01-09 21:00:28 The value of a crouton lies in the amount of garlic and olive oil it can absorb.
1696 2018-01-09 21:00:21 朝方まで作業お疲れ様です
この時間のラーメンがなんか良いなと思いました
そういう日もたまには…！雰囲気雰囲気、と！
1697 2018-01-09 21:00:18 And the rapeseed oil in it is one of the worst for your health!
1698 2018-01-09 21:00:14 So how exactly does this name designation change things for this park?  Does this now allow us to drill for oil there?  Asking for my sister...
1699 2018-01-09 21:00:14 Not the first time I have heard that. I was told the same thing in summer of 2014 when I said oil would fall below $50 when it was $107.
1700 2018-01-09 21:00:13 #Wintertip: Dogs struggle with winter skin similar to humans. Try coconut oil! 1/4 tablespoon for every 10 pounds of body weights twice daily will aid in preventing dry skin and coat during the winter months. 
#winter #petcare #personalassistant #twittertakeover
1701 2018-01-09 20:59:54 went in for a $25 oil change and I’m leaving with a $600 bill for tires. Still haven’t fixed it from the accident either so wow
1702 2018-01-09 20:59:49 And how dose that affect the prices of garri and red oil in our markets that were skyrocketed months back?
1703 2018-01-09 20:59:48 You notice that Bernie has no funding mechanism or hard numbers in his scam of a bill either.  He's a con man selling snake oil to a bunch of low info kids.
1704 2018-01-09 20:59:47 I can't talk
I'm using an oil painting! :-\ 
1705 2018-01-09 20:59:37 @RoryStewartUK what’s the thinking behind moving you from foreign ministry? As somebody who has worked and lived through the oil industry in places nobody has ever heard of , I know instinctively an expert on foreign affairs when I see one . Good luck in new role.
1706 2018-01-09 20:59:23 I add my own peppermint oil. When I get it with it already in it the shampoo is terrible.
1707 2018-01-09 20:59:19 Hmm what to do before work, get something to eat and actually feel good all day or get the oil change my car has been yelling at me to get for almost a week?
1708 2018-01-09 20:58:57 Loaded $GBR and $MXC the past week.  Ready for the oil run.
1709 2018-01-09 20:58:56 Yall can put that cheap, not actually oil, white, creamy, chemical heavy,GMO crisco on your bodies.

$30 on 1 12 oz batch of my formula and youll have smoother, even toned skin, moisture for days, an immune system boost, and it will last you all year.

Hmu for details
1710 2018-01-09 20:58:44 I know that feeling Madame. Once I cried as I'd pointed chicken wrong earlier in the day by forgetting the olive oil I brushed on it to cook it. That meant I couldn't have the glass of milk before bed that I carefully planned for. I'd  omitted milk from my coffee all day.
1711 2018-01-09 20:58:44 Ta. It is. I just chop it, add a little oil and the seasoning in a bowl, mix it around, then toss it in the pan for about 2-3 minutes.
1712 2018-01-09 20:58:42 How the hell did I have an appointment for an oil change at 2, & it’s almost 2 hours later & THEY JUST TOOK MY CAR IN
1713 2018-01-09 20:58:41 That's how I feel about stuff with peppermint oil
1714 2018-01-09 20:58:40 these brushes i got for oil painting r so long i never used brushes dis long. they look like drumsticks
1715 2018-01-09 20:58:34 Once I get a few crop checks built up, Im deffintely getting a challenger next lol, but I can't check oil leases in a dodge challenger haha
1716 2018-01-09 20:58:11 When I need clothes, I ask for gift cards. That way I can spend it only on clothes. It doesn't end up as groceries or an oil change.
1717 2018-01-09 20:58:06 *makes the mistake of looking at the comments section on an anti-fracking article* Apparently, if we stop fracking and drilling for oil we will instantly lose modern society and have to “plug your iPhones into your butts and walk to work”
1718 2018-01-09 20:58:04 Popular narrative that inflation pressures building & commodities poised for significant move. Oil is big reason for temporary inflation uptick & oil is topping here as is copper. USD has little upside here & big downside to 86, probably in the 1st half.
1719 2018-01-09 20:57:59 But will you allow oil and gas exploration on site?
1720 2018-01-09 20:57:58 I don't like coal or oil.
1721 2018-01-09 20:57:53 Mmmmm. The tesponse to olive oil and butter is as expected thus the design can’t be too flawed. Be interested to see results of full trial
1722 2018-01-09 20:57:51 No wrong , most of my blog ARGUES to have the likes of tax avoidance removed , and instead using ONSHORE havens like housing and infrastructure investment , along the lines of NSandI today. Using oil for creating post carbon economy for the people as stakeholders.
1723 2018-01-09 20:57:49 #ECO
Since floating last year, Eco’s share price has been boosted by huge discoveries nearby as Guyana begins to establish itself as one of the hottest oil exploration areas in the world.
1724 2018-01-09 20:57:47 Wars are started because of money.. "resources" (oil. Gold etc) equals FUNDS

1726 2018-01-09 20:57:43 bone broth. probiotic yoghurt (must have lactobacillus casei or reuteri) it will help shorten flu/ colds, oil of oregano, ginger, turmeric. any elixir or smoothie from open source organics. repeat, repeat, repeat and you shall live.
1727 2018-01-09 20:57:40 Glad to hear it, you should get a sudafed nasal spray, not faffing about with an olbas oil they’re shite. Remember I use my sudfed all the time since the Rovers incident!!
1728 2018-01-09 20:57:30 Closing VISION on oil..
1. $SCO 1st RED BOP only, no sense of sell volume exhaustion curl
2. $DWT closer, RED BOPS, closer to volume sell exhaustion but not done
1729 2018-01-09 20:57:28 If it get any long I’m gonna have to get you some beard oil I can go ahead and send you so if you’d like
1730 2018-01-09 20:57:24 Since Nick Foles has been under center, Philadelphia's offense has resembled a 1999 Honda Civic in need of an oil change and transmission fluid flush.
1731 2018-01-09 20:57:20 Ever made your own? They're good when they're done right. Dehydrated starch cubes in a plastic bag =/= good day-old bread toasted w/oil and herbs
1732 2018-01-09 20:57:19 I pray my future child loves musicals as much as I do 
1733 2018-01-09 20:56:54 It’s because the pressure of the blue down arrow that it is coming down
1734 2018-01-09 20:56:51 Let's put our country's support behind all the amazing people who are coming up with 21st century ideas for energy.  Oil and coal are killing the planet. Seemingly every other country on the planet recognizes the need for significant government investment in alternative energy.
1735 2018-01-09 20:56:39 @SutherlandInst funded by the #KochBrothers , the #darkmoney ATM of oil industries, is undermining the politics of the Sovereign Nations for their own political and corporate agendas! #StandWithBearsEars

1738 2018-01-09 20:56:35 God, it’s like oil spill footage of people washing sea birds! How is Cat doing?
1739 2018-01-09 20:56:31 Which you and Sec Zinke will no doubt eliminate next year to drill oil or make it a monument to White Supremacists
1740 2018-01-09 20:56:30 Hey min, that’s not fair, some of us are stuck here with that swivel eyed, slack jawed loon plus a bent council who cheated us out of our snp vote by making a deal with the tories to keep their jobs & fingers in all the oil companies. My bit, Abdn City have @KirstySNP, she’s ace.
1741 2018-01-09 20:56:29 has oil peaked as nk and iran reduce the heat perhaps back to 55
1742 2018-01-09 20:56:28 And yet she is another part of the cult of celebrity, and made her money selling snake oil on daytime TV

1744 2018-01-09 20:56:12 Yesterday I stopped to help a woman who had fallen off her motorbike after skidding on oil.  She was lying on the cold, wet pavement and couldn’t move. An ambulance was called. She was still there 2 hours later.
1745 2018-01-09 20:56:04 So when in 2015 oil prices fell from 130usd to 29 Usd, and hovered in 35-40 range, 34 % of your import bill came down to 1/4th. What a bounty on Forex, and what a missed opportunity, as Modi chose not to pass benefit to indstry/people, and instead accumulated funds with Govt.
1746 2018-01-09 20:55:56 Moisturize, use it to cook instead of vegetable oil, leave it in your hair

1749 2018-01-09 20:55:38 Until there’s oil to be drilled there, or real estate to be developed.
1750 2018-01-09 20:55:25 Is it going to be REAL investigating or propaganda catering to oil and gas

1753 2018-01-09 20:54:59 I wonder when we'll start seeing some small/micro cap oil and gas companies announce their own initial coin offering to get that 100% jump in their stock price? #ICO #blockchain #Cryptocurreny #yyc #alberta #oil #kodakcoin

1757 2018-01-09 20:54:37 If you do that make sure to pay off the fish with a paper towel and use a very small amount of oil your not frying it but you don't want it to stick either. Also make sure you have a hot pan when you start.
1758 2018-01-09 20:54:35 And this person sells snake oil! Pure garbage! Have watch her for years! BS
1759 2018-01-09 20:54:33 Fries are technically a vegetable. Potato fried in VEGETABLE OIL. Double the veggie.

1762 2018-01-09 20:54:29 My point is that olive oil consumption in ancient times does not mean it was healthy. It was the first processed food created to allow cheap transportation and preservation of olive calories. The folk with gens incompatible with that died.

1770 2018-01-09 20:53:53 Branding done right: I got @LevenRoseBeauty jojoba oil and it came with a card with a sweet note and code for a free trial size bottle (not including shipping) PLUS the bottle itself has a 30% off code for your next bottle. So smart!
1771 2018-01-09 20:53:53 My technical understanding of cryptocurrencies is close to minimal regarding basics but I believe that backing a virtual highly speculative crypto currency with a sovereign country 's #oil reserves is dangerous and extremely uncertain.. #petro #oil #oott #venezuela
1772 2018-01-09 20:53:39 Ew oil i puked in my mouth.. And then again when i read mayo... Unless our butter/porridge tastes slightly different and their mayo/whatever tastes different too then it'd all make sense
1773 2018-01-09 20:53:36 Allowing a bit of oil drilling in there at the same time? Just askin'?
1774 2018-01-09 20:53:27 very extreme way of arguing. We don't have City/Chelsea/United money!! Measuring up with their spending is unfair, and competing with them on our budget is impressive. 

You'd like Spurs better if we were bought and run with infinite oil money? That's not ambition
1775 2018-01-09 20:53:12 I’m at the point where I really wouldn’t mind a sugar daddy. Like yaaaaas lemme rub some oil on ya hairy tummy and pay my tuition daddy

1783 2018-01-09 20:52:18 Great. So when it will be open for oil drilling?
1784 2018-01-09 20:52:13 I guess the oil companies dont want to drill there?

1788 2018-01-09 20:51:57 Protecting jobs. Telling us we couldn't use the pound. Telling us that our oil resources are a burden. Telling us that we too small, parochial, incompetent and poor to do such an extraordinary thing as run our own country
1789 2018-01-09 20:51:57 Currently listening to a guy getting super pissed while ordering Chinese because he needs the hot oil not the paste, no noodles, no baby carrots, only hot and spicy beef (extra), no rice, etc...then gets pissed cause they are asking questions to make sure it’s correct 
1790 2018-01-09 20:51:55 Laughable. If you don’t think the USA wasn’t in constant contact with him, then you haven’t researched. Mexico used some snake oil tactics. The kid got upset that Arena didn’t call him up, and threw a tantrum that he will regret later.

1792 2018-01-09 20:51:39 You do understand how Greece got in their problem correct? Hint: it isn't why you think.  Also, the state in France is larger than that of Venezuela. It is far from "socialist." They pegged their economy to oil. Their economy follows the price of it naturally.

1798 2018-01-09 20:50:45 Fact is, what is being inflicted on AB is thanks to the oil industry shooting itself in the foot. No gov’t ordered the technological advances that led to the supply glut (again). The push for cost reductions is direct cause of job-losses.
1799 2018-01-09 20:50:42 Wow! What makes you so bullish on oil?
1800 2018-01-09 20:50:30 I grabbed the last two bags of olive oil popcorn at Trader Joe’s hehehehe
1801 2018-01-09 20:50:03 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
1802 2018-01-09 20:49:57 Why? Is there oil under it and you are going to drill there next year?
1803 2018-01-09 20:49:52 And  don't  forget  those  oil rigs  you  voted  for!  YEAP #GOP big business and  rich folk  matter! You bought it
1804 2018-01-09 20:49:35 Our most valuable resource isn’t gold, it isn’t diamonds, it isn’t oil. Our most valuable resource is the black woman.
1805 2018-01-09 20:49:23 Now can we drill there for oil?
1806 2018-01-09 20:49:20 Coconut oil works really well and won’t irritate! :)

1811 2018-01-09 20:48:47 The dollar is not the reserve currency because of oil, it's the reserve currency because of history. FX markets exist to sort out differences in which currencies people hold/accept. In any case, if foreigners stopped wanting to accumulate dollar-assets, then we would stop

1814 2018-01-09 20:48:08 @EPAScottPruitt claims the original #CleanPowerPlan overstepped #EPA authority. 
BUT #Truth Be Told: The move to repeal and replace the plan is really about protecting Big #Polluters’ #contributors at our #environments expense.

1815 2018-01-09 20:48:05 Lucas Oil Stadium gives Indy Eleven the proper clothes needed to look professional for a job interview. I think your casuals who have money will be more likely to come to a game at LOS than The Mike.

1820 2018-01-09 20:47:36 That's what I was doing! But our tires were old, so...yeah. I did actually get the oil changed when we first got here, and even though the mileage doesn't require it yet, the system was hollering for a change. Screw it, says I. Since it's there, I mean.
1821 2018-01-09 20:47:33 @realDonaldTrump No #DACA unless Mexico gives us their oil rights. Your base does not want amnesty period. There are enough people trying to get in legally and this is not fair to them.
1822 2018-01-09 20:47:32 And I still gotta get my oil change. That’s maintenance for ya.
1823 2018-01-09 20:47:31 Phase 1. DACA with promises that will never be kept.

1831 2018-01-09 20:46:26 $oil continues to make new 2 year highs.  And they keep sleeping on small cap oil.  $ped is going to pop.  Been patiently buying the impatient shares all day.

1833 2018-01-09 20:46:03 Been debating if I should invest in a air fryer are they any good and healthier then deep frying in oil ?
1834 2018-01-09 20:46:02 Modi govt got windfall bounty bec of huge oil price fall since Feb 2015. It did not pass any benefit to people/industry, instead chose to increase duties. I guess huge accumulations exist with govt, and Modi will use this to distribute largesse in rural before 2019.
1835 2018-01-09 20:45:54 I was about to put oil in my car but then some guy was staring at me so I decided to wait til I got home.

1837 2018-01-09 20:45:40 What has Butts said in reference to oil production when he was president of WWF Canada? That is the government stance on oil because Butts leads the government. Trudeau says his PM role is ceremonial.

1842 2018-01-09 20:45:14 Have anxiety? Get yourself lavender essential oil and carry it with you. When you feel anxiety coming on smell it and take a deep breathe. It soothes you, and studies have shown that it decreases blood pressure and heart rate.
1843 2018-01-09 20:45:13 So, will you shrink it now to allow oil drilling there?

1850 2018-01-09 20:44:25 Must not be any oil or natural gas in that park.

Frybread.

I asked for a 5lb $8 bluebird flour. Makes softer frybread. 

He came home with a 20 lbs bluebird bag from the other store who had a sale.

At this point crisco oil may not cut it. We'll see. 

Homemade soup.

1879 2018-01-09 20:41:26 He ignored the protest over the Dakota pipeline. It had already leaked. It didn't matter if it leaked into the drinking water of native Americans. It was shameful to take away land or clean resources for oil or gas industries. Shameful to destroy our resources for this reason.

1896 2018-01-09 20:39:34 They don't care. You better hope they don't lift all the restrictions to try to tap oil reserves under the lakes.

1922 2018-01-09 20:36:18 @MaxBlumenthal MSNBC still gets it's marching orders from big oil money. No shock that there is only 1 side spoken of.
1923 2018-01-09 20:36:17 No, just putting a draw on the reservoir. This way when you spin off the filter the only oil that comes out is what's in the filter itself.

1929 2018-01-09 20:36:06 Not the point. Fruit oils (olive, red palm) \= seed oils. Composition is very different. Olive oil doesn't vindicate Crisco.
1930 2018-01-09 20:36:01 Lol OIL COMPANIES
1931 2018-01-09 20:36:01 Well the Oil are there soon so maybe somebody can pull Pete's pant leg but he seems paranoid now after so many bad deals.
1932 2018-01-09 20:35:51 Is this before or after you destroy the land in Alaska that you sold out to big oil?
1933 2018-01-09 20:35:48 ahora imagina, le bajas el gas oil un 20% . La diferencia es muy poca para el productor. Y corres el riesgo que el fletero se te quede con ella. El problema es el precio internacional del trigo.

1936 2018-01-09 20:35:41 It will confirm what most people suspect and corporations will end up trying to block most of the tech since I'm sure the ships or vehicles aren't running off of coal and oil

1938 2018-01-09 20:35:35 Yes! BUT if @JustinTrudeau really wanted to help our struggling oil sector he could stop the 'regulatory carbon footprint creep' of the NEB and might be able to resurrect it??
#CAPP @EnergyEast ??
1939 2018-01-09 20:35:32 Because the prices of oil is still not that high. We need it at about 80 bucks, but even at 62 bucks we are almost back to the way it was before the mini bust  a couple of yrs ago.
1940 2018-01-09 20:35:32 Hmmmm, you're no oil painting ma'man
1941 2018-01-09 20:35:24 Castor oil helps with growth.Coconut oil for moisture  always use heat protection & oils to protect from the harsh cold winds.we all need taking care of don't forget the hair it's so important !

1943 2018-01-09 20:35:07 we do depend too much on them and are tied too tight in my opinion...but this is not the time to start firing up the coal and oil...want to work with oil? fine...build refineries (that we don't need)...and stop selling our oil to the states...then buying it back at a loss
1944 2018-01-09 20:35:03 Will a move to Lucas Oil Stadium in addition to a move to USL help @IndyEleven grow their attendance?
1945 2018-01-09 20:34:58 The game , is the game about oil money 
1946 2018-01-09 20:34:56 I don't wash my hair every day. I wash it every 2-3 days because my hair be so dry. I also do leave in conditioner in my hair and sometimes I do a little pink oil lotion. I have dry hair bad.  @InfluensterVox @garnierUSA #SuperHair #InfluensterTreat
1947 2018-01-09 20:34:53 there are anumbe rof ways these could have been released. Feinstein is running for re-election and is challenged by a genuine Democrat. Notice how many #Trump appointments got an unchallenged pass from her - oil and military never challenged by her. consider @David4SenateCA

1951 2018-01-09 20:34:27 Oh, good
 "The commitment will come"

It's just a broken promise. Nothing drastic
Just like a broken vow
Or a hidden McCrone Report
Or 6000 sq mls of Scottish waters secretly appropriated by Westminster
Or the squandering of NSea oil
Or pulling the plug on carbon capture
Etc etc
1952 2018-01-09 20:34:26 I’m going to relax though & only add lemon, olive oil & pepper as dressing. Bc summer is really right around the corner.

1954 2018-01-09 20:34:23 They probably told him that there was oil under it so that it could be opened up for drilling.
1955 2018-01-09 20:34:16 I would definitely recommend hot oil treatment masks the night before you wash then after you was use the Garnier treatment mask! #SuperHair #InfluensterTreat

1961 2018-01-09 20:33:46 I have the plastic thing all it is hair and coconut oil my maintenance guy hates me
1962 2018-01-09 20:33:46 For me, I actually had to soak the bridle in the oil instead of just using a sponge and rubbing it on. It seems weird, but it worked! My saddle was a little harder, but after 3-4 times it darkened well.
1963 2018-01-09 20:33:45 Cuz you spout for the oil industry but care about the planet. We've established this.
1964 2018-01-09 20:33:36 Not defending fosil; raising another question: shocking when you have to face environmental issues at home (also caused by non-US oil companies, the horror!) instead of ruining other countries' ecosystems to quench your oil thirst, isn't it?
1965 2018-01-09 20:33:28 Yes!!!
1966 2018-01-09 20:33:26 We import very little oil from the ME now & the oil patch is hopping right now. People moving back in droves & unemployment rate for Midland, TX is 2.8(9-17 data) It's cheaper to drill here in W. TX than offshore & I doubt oil companies will go to the extra expenses right now.
1967 2018-01-09 20:33:21 your rod and your staff, they comfort me.  You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.

1973 2018-01-09 20:32:45 Can they drill for oil there?
1974 2018-01-09 20:32:43 Banter gifs are beating oil money and it’s completely fucking impossible to know what to be angry about any more.
1975 2018-01-09 20:32:42 One thing is for sure..might actually attend more of them at Lucas Oil. @Schultz975
1976 2018-01-09 20:32:32 No sense looking for new markets. Without pipelines to the coasts, our oil might as well be coal.  This is the way @JustinTrudeau & @cathmckenna planned it.
1977 2018-01-09 20:32:31 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.

1979 2018-01-09 20:32:27 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."
1980 2018-01-09 20:32:26 Way, he, Trump... Just ending a 9 cent tax on oil producing companies to cover oil spills and clean up after spills... He did it for the SoS old company Exxon and other oil companies. 
1981 2018-01-09 20:32:24 You don't own the oil and gas rights, I'm afraid. As surface owner you could block access though. The reform in s43 of the Infrastructure Act 2015 of underground trespass laws only applied to England and Wales 
1982 2018-01-09 20:32:23 And immediately after bringing the two parties together Agent Orange proceeded to make oil and water finally be able to mix
1983 2018-01-09 20:32:13 I feel this on a spiritual level. When Jeff and I moved we weren’t about to fill our oil for us to use it for 2 weeks. So we took cold showers for 2 weeks straight. I got the flu. It was awful.
1984 2018-01-09 20:31:58 There must not have been any oil or uranium under the site.
1985 2018-01-09 20:31:56 I got a bunch of 2-in-1 products. But basically I use a cleanser/toner then conditioner then oil. If I need a deep clean I got this buff cleanse stuff where I’d just use that instead.
1986 2018-01-09 20:31:48 Why does a private company have to ask the #FAA permission to go to the #moon? The #UnitedStates doesn't own the moon and its not like the moon has oil.
1987 2018-01-09 20:31:37 You are the man to pass this on to our dear President!: Please Mr. President, do remember THE RANCHERS too, and Farmers!,  save them from the corrupt BLM;  AND PARDON BUNDY/FAMILY! And, save our Wild Mustangs too! And please PROMOTE use of CANNABIS for PAPER PRODUCTS (&amp;/oil)!
1988 2018-01-09 20:31:26 I'd recommend making your own beard oil. Some great recipes online and will cost a lot less.
1989 2018-01-09 20:31:24 Now all you have to do is figure out how to destroy it.  No oil, no uranium, can you build a couple of golf clubs that no one can afford?  I have confidence you and the greedy Republicans can come up with something.
1990 2018-01-09 20:31:13 You can easily remove a sticker that won't fully remove or leaves a sticky residue by rubbing in a small amount of WD-40. Then simply wash the oil away with soapy water.
1991 2018-01-09 20:31:04 We paid to arm SDF, we paid to bomb ISIS in front of them and now we are paying for rebuilding what we destroyed... 
But now, the oil in Syria is our, and just SDF blood has spilt.

2013 2018-01-09 20:29:27 @NTFormby will be on hand tmrw at 10.30am Lifeboat Rd car park Formby to provide all equipment and guidance for a beach cleansing of palm oil deposits. Warning : Do not bring dogs as palm oil is highly toxic to them.
2014 2018-01-09 20:29:12 I did this today which helped but isn’t cutting it. I’m thinking of getting an actual darkening oil
2015 2018-01-09 20:29:11 I was studying @ucsantabarbara at the time. Oil was everywhere. And not even a month after the El Refugio spill, Ventura had a leak, adding more oil to the shoreline.

#offshoredrilling cannot, cannot, cannot be expanded. Continuing it alone is a crime against the environment.
2016 2018-01-09 20:29:07 Like the people that’ll collect the rice & oil are on Twitter. Even some on this twitter will collect so what are we saying. 
There’s hunger in the land man & people don’t care about any means used theirs is to have the food.
2017 2018-01-09 20:29:07 Is the vacuum sucking up the oil?
2018 2018-01-09 20:29:01 I'm sure oil companies are thrilled. The rest of us are paying more and more, ever since January of 2017.
2019 2018-01-09 20:28:55 Obviously no oil under that small piece of Atlanta! All to willing to destroy our National Resources for $!
2020 2018-01-09 20:28:54 In order for Oil to go to $10 and Copper to go to $1 you're talking about a systemic round of deflation worse than 2008. If that did happen CBs would go ballistic with QE and interventions.
2021 2018-01-09 20:28:53 cut up squash, peppers, toss with oil and steak seasoning. Chase around a medium hot skillet. Not enough to cook them too soft. just enough heat to scare them. throw + mushrooms just before you take them off
2022 2018-01-09 20:28:49 美味しそう
2023 2018-01-09 20:28:39 Thing is even doctors in the NHS are off the record suggesting people smoke the oil from the chemists to help with (scuse the pun) joint relief. The time is now
2024 2018-01-09 20:28:25 Your article incorrectly implies the government really wants to provide food and medicine, but is struggling with oil prices and a bit of mismanagement.  In reality, this is a brutal narco-tyranny which DOES NOT prioritize such considerations.
2025 2018-01-09 20:28:13 Don’t forget 70% of the energy in oil is discarded as heat and noise by internal combustion engines.

Should start with energy required and work backwards rather than starting with primary energy use. Eg my Leaf EV 2.92 miles per kWh = 4.546 x 10.7 kw x 2.92 = 142 imperial MPG
2026 2018-01-09 20:28:08 What about other economic indices? We shouldn't be relax or jubilating bcoz the price of crude oil has increased, we need to urgently deregulate the oil industry, start refining & diversify. Oil will lose its value in world market in future! Let's make hay while the sun shines!!
2027 2018-01-09 20:27:59 Maybe they'll tax anything fried in oil next.
2028 2018-01-09 20:27:59 Why do I like you already? Bruh

2032 2018-01-09 20:27:42 That would have to be the same stuff. Toxic is the middle name in the oil sector.
2033 2018-01-09 20:27:32 And based on driving conditions in the USA, you’re saying that drivers in New York where temperatures fluctuate just like Ontario, can hit the same mileage between oil changes as those in Florida and California?

2035 2018-01-09 20:27:16 Right Greg, all the evidence points to CO2, & man contributes a GREAT deal of CO2 pollution that’s outside our “system” ie all the oil below the surface (not part of our system) that we drill and burn is the main significant factor.
2036 2018-01-09 20:27:13 banana egg pancakes! you only need one super ripe banana, 2 eggs and use coconut oil, instead of butter, to bake with

2042 2018-01-09 20:26:57 Why wouldn't you just eliminate the water in your fuel system? Takes 1.5% water to cause phase separation, and that amount would be bad for any fuel. #ethanol
2043 2018-01-09 20:26:52 To darken any of my tack, I warm up a 1/2 cup of olive oil, 1/4 cup of coconut oil and 1/4 cup of sesame oil. The tack I got was super dry so I just painted it on with a brush while watching tv until it just didn't absorb anymore oil
2044 2018-01-09 20:26:45 Yeah Franchese is pounded veal or even chicken breast w/ a bit of flour to hold an egg coating (it’s actually egg, not breading). Then it’s fried in butter, not oil. Then served w/lemon twist on it.
2045 2018-01-09 20:26:41 Oil and money seem be a never ending reason for fighting. Also Biafran Christians are fighting against encroaching Islamic law. The pictures coming out of Biafra are brutal.

2053 2018-01-09 20:26:01 Are you going to give it to the oil companies for fracking like you did with our other protected lands #Trump ?
2054 2018-01-09 20:25:37 Need Purpul oil for somself. Been getting folks on forgetting to replenish... 

Nice thing is I got my niece on now
2055 2018-01-09 20:25:27 Really don’t understand why these people try to play me every time I get an oil change.  I really have to bug up EVERY time.
2056 2018-01-09 20:25:22 My family has only had Honda’s for 20plus Years.  You do the oil changes and normal maintenance and they’ll last 200k plus miles.
2057 2018-01-09 20:25:18 Does anyone have data how much oil producers have hedged since #WTI went above 60? Imagine once the market starts to sour again. The decline in price will not have any effect on market supply. We'll have lower price for longer. This will be really bad. #OOTT
2058 2018-01-09 20:25:17 TRANSLATION: Until we find oil nearby then I'm canceling it like I did with all of those other national parks this year....
2059 2018-01-09 20:25:06 Oil will go to $70 and the E&P space will still be trading as if oil was $45
 $APA $PXD $OAS $WLL $XOP #shitsector
2060 2018-01-09 20:25:05 And then don't forget to sign another one to allow it to be drilled for oil.
2061 2018-01-09 20:25:05 Rapeseed oil you sure looks like a urine sample.. #InsideTheFactory

I do hope she apologised for being such a massive cow & if not fingers crossed karma got her, hard! #Evil
2067 2018-01-09 20:24:43 Plenty of oil in the tank #insidethefactory
2068 2018-01-09 20:24:42 Wonder if he thought about swapping that rapeseed oil for a urine sample to see if they noticed! #InsideTheFactory
2069 2018-01-09 20:24:39 So I guess you are a gas advocate. There are just four available, proven fuel sources for large scale, reliable electricity sufficient for an industrial economy like Germany. Oil has irreplaceable uses for transport, leaving gas, coal & uranium. Most pick a mix
2070 2018-01-09 20:24:32 Well put, but to be fair, my quick napkin math suggests a 100% tax on fossil fuel companies wouldn’t subsidize #UBI either. So not sure that this is the right rhetorical tool with which to falsify or confirm the “Data is the new oil” cliche. Also, banks = data, so there’s that...
2071 2018-01-09 20:24:22 “I’d put my money on the sun and solar energy. What a source of power! I hope we don’t have to wait till oil and coal run out before we tackle that. I wish I had more years left!” - Thomas Edison
2072 2018-01-09 20:24:18 i know!! just frustrating cause my skin is so oily hahaha, even baking my makeup makes it stay on for about 5 hours max before ave got a pool of oil on my dome cbaaa
2073 2018-01-09 20:24:15 TRANSLATION: Until we find oil nearby then I'm canceling it like I did with all of those other national parks this year....
2074 2018-01-09 20:24:08 That rapeseed oil looks like a pot of piss #insidethefactory
2075 2018-01-09 20:24:02 In before we're allowed to drill for oil there.
2076 2018-01-09 20:23:57 Got you all.
2077 2018-01-09 20:23:57 Timeless is fire, but they put preservatives in their oil to make the terps taste better, i don’t care lmao I’m rocking with one right now but i found a different brand that claims to be more natural
2078 2018-01-09 20:23:49 ..^^ next month is gonna be super hard. College tuitions, new tires and oil change and insurance for my motorbike (I cant afford a car xD So I got a bike) and the TFN flight. I wanna take more commissions and lower the price a little. 3 commissions would already save my sorry ass
2079 2018-01-09 20:23:49 Can’t use butane but thanks my love!! Kerosene and candle oil mixed for lots of weirdly specific reasons. Use I.T to refill a good torch
2080 2018-01-09 20:23:47 I had missed this news at the time:

China surpassed the US as world's largest importer of crude oil in 2017.
2081 2018-01-09 20:23:41 shove sum tea tree oil on it and it’ll b fine xo
2082 2018-01-09 20:23:26 coconut oil 
2083 2018-01-09 20:23:26 I drizzled some homemade coconut oil on toast , then avo then pink salt,  black pepper, cayenne pepper n drizzle evoo on top of red onions...OMGGGGG

2085 2018-01-09 20:23:16 Sure. But the "anti" side is still funded by big oil, coal, etc. Don't be surprised when you see these co. start investing. the other way.
2086 2018-01-09 20:23:13 So in the summer can I safely do the 12-16,000km on synthetic oil just like our American counterparts? ‘Canadian driving conditions’ isn’t really an answer to this vast difference
2087 2018-01-09 20:23:06 ;v; thanks asa, id try my best!!! probably, like, burn my fucking hand in the fry oil tho or smth
2088 2018-01-09 20:23:02 "Price of oil being up has nothing to do with anything, nothing to see there, here look a rebate cheque to play with, now run and play my little flowers!"  Fucking sheep #eatshitndp
2089 2018-01-09 20:23:00 When do the oil rigs go up? #maga
2090 2018-01-09 20:23:00 She was NUS top brass, worked in media and as an SNP full timer then the US govt and in oil and gas before getting elected, we're not talking Keir Hardie here
2091 2018-01-09 20:22:58 Coconut oil really the shit! I don’t need nothing else in my hair Lol
2092 2018-01-09 20:22:57 I use the black soap that everyone recommends, and then sometimes i use a neutrogena toner, and then either tea tree oil or vitamin E oil for my scars & then a moisturizer
2093 2018-01-09 20:22:52 Lemons! Tip from the master Gordon Ramsey is rubbing fingers with a fresh lemon slice will take off the chilli oil.
2094 2018-01-09 20:22:48 I then decreased the size of the park by 45% and allowed oil and gas drilling on site. #ILoveTheBlacks #MAGA
2095 2018-01-09 20:22:44 done - thank you - I'm just so fed up in so much non recyclable packaging and no one really paying any heed to what the use of palm oil is doing to rainforests.
2096 2018-01-09 20:22:35 @StefanMolyneux It's good to see that the industry is coming along so willingly finally (and so quietly), without opposition from big oil. Guess you don't need an Aztec Headdress to make progress around here these days.
2097 2018-01-09 20:22:34 There must not be any oil, coal, or uranium there.
2098 2018-01-09 20:22:16 smart move if they did.  Volatility almost as low now as when oil was at $100 for petes sake
2099 2018-01-09 20:21:53 Skip the baguette! Pour the oil over something low carb -tomato, avocado, eggs, a steak! Eat more good fats & fewer carbs, you'll be less hungry
2100 2018-01-09 20:21:51 Almond oil is underrated.
2101 2018-01-09 20:21:42 Hau babe, how else must I clean my ears kana? I put in the oil and then after? Mpethe ka prescription yao kwagala mouwe 
2102 2018-01-09 20:21:42 I've been using the "Get Going" essential oil by @HoMedics and I feel amaze. It's replaced my casual 6 cups of coffee a day.
2103 2018-01-09 20:21:36 Well, generally when we think of “recession” we think of an event with negative economy-wide impacts, enough to turn aggregate job growth negative, for example. But, yes, you can have a sector specific downturn, such at oil/gas drilling in 2015/6.
2104 2018-01-09 20:21:36 You’re showing Alberta production.  The article was “USA sets record....”, so the logical comparison is to Canada. Canada is currently not producing record oil.
2105 2018-01-09 20:21:34 If oil will fail to $10 and $1 you're going to flush 50% of the market so in a whille thie price of oild will reach like 200$
2106 2018-01-09 20:21:19 I hate when people use baby oil as a moisturizer.... 
2107 2018-01-09 20:21:13 Test for our city: as price of oil is driven higher by global demand and geopolitical instability, will we choose to play as Top 60 city in the world, or will we go back to our complacent ways? #2018IMPACT
2108 2018-01-09 20:21:08 The line to get a oil change rn is ridiculous

"Wase tho mai pighla hua launda hun par yaha mai sakht ho gaya"
2110 2018-01-09 20:20:26 Martin Luther King would have rejected the designation after you opened all national parks for oil and minerals exploration.

How smart and genius is that?

2111 2018-01-09 20:20:23 @javorszky not a heavy Twitter user, my bad, but here you go: oil in pan followed immediately by food. Just watch it doesn't burn, hope your smoke alarm isn't too sensitive 
2112 2018-01-09 20:20:14 Nice! When do you start drilling for oil on the property?
2113 2018-01-09 20:20:14 People always ask me what products I put in my hair to keep these curls hydrated, soft, & poppin! Honestly, I just use Coconut oil & leave-in conditioners
2114 2018-01-09 20:20:13 Lol y’all gotta stop coming for Kendall Jenner’s acne when your scalp smells like oil and burnt rubber baby. Acne is normal.
2115 2018-01-09 20:20:11 I really am trying to be optimistic about Georgia next year because of the recruiting class, but on paper means nothing. Until we see these guys perform on the field it could be fools gold. It’s really early for the anointing oil
2116 2018-01-09 20:20:05 When are we going to stop our blind dependancy on oil? The overall true cost of oil is staggering.

after the fact he stated it was straight THC oil
2144 2018-01-09 20:17:42 And how from that one can deduce, say, percentage of oil calories and their variability in diet?

2150 2018-01-09 20:17:15 Scotland has progressed well with wind power & there has been lots of investement. Also invested in wave power which hasn’t performed well at all. Until such time technologies are so advanced that we are all using renewables for all our needs, we will continue to need oil/gas 1/1
2151 2018-01-09 20:17:14 Who has thought about trying the oil that is helping so many people get healthy but still has questions?

2157 2018-01-09 20:15:56 I finally got my first oil change! Being almost 22,000 miles overdue isn’t THAT bad, right?
2158 2018-01-09 20:15:55 Ayuh lah burning the midnight oil.

2161 2018-01-09 20:15:22 Blotus also signed an order repealing a small tax on each gallon of oil.  This tax was to be accumulated into a fund for clean up of any future oil spill.  Guess we won't have this fund.  Perhaps Blotus should do the clean up himself.
2162 2018-01-09 20:15:20 Sweet Jesus. I was once on a runaway oil rig during hurricane force winds in the Gulf of Mexico. I was later congratulated for my composure, but what I was thinking about in those 12 desperate hours was, "Will it hurt when we go over and the cold salt water fills my lungs?"

2168 2018-01-09 20:14:45 I'm willing to go back to only natural spills....The oil companies know they need to exploit NOW because fossil fuel is a dinosaur, like coal...

2170 2018-01-09 20:14:39 How about those #CIA #Torture report documents that are now forever buried as a direct result of her duplicity? She's grandstanding in a struggle for re-election against a real candidate who is not owned by warmongers and oil. @David4SenateCA retweet this! @SenFeinstein Retire!
2171 2018-01-09 20:14:37 I've done that at home before. Used to just smoke till tender. Now, I smoke till *almost* done, them brush w/oil or butter and throw on hot grill till slightly crisp. Of course, I'm an oddball, I *like* cauliflower, lol
2172 2018-01-09 20:14:33 But if the US isn't seeing great oil demand, then that is telling.
2173 2018-01-09 20:14:23 I have this set and it is my staple when I break out! The tea tree oil in the kit is amazing!
2174 2018-01-09 20:13:59 Finally sucked it up and took my car to the dealership. Needs a headlight repaired (not a bulb replaced, no), a front license plate mount installed, new tires, and an oil change. Because why do one thing at a time, I guess.
2175 2018-01-09 20:13:53 Getting an oil change takes five-ever.
2176 2018-01-09 20:13:49 Crisco will also work!  Double-check your bird seed too as they sometimes will throw peanuts or oil into it.

2211 2018-01-09 20:09:59 Now that I have my essential oil diffuser idk what I’d do without it like it’s so soothing. Every time I go to bed I can breathe in this lavender mist and drift off to a blissful sleep
2212 2018-01-09 20:09:55 Oil prices hit highs not seen since May 2015 supported by OPC-led production cuts and expectations of lower U.S. crude inventories.
2213 2018-01-09 20:09:41 WTI oil at $62.04/barrel, +$0.30.

2215 2018-01-09 20:09:37 Glad to hear that colleges are finally getting involved with the Oil and Gas Energy Programs. I’ve had numerous interns work under me and I really enjoyed it. I tried to teach them everything I know.
2216 2018-01-09 20:09:31 BREAKING: “The Port of Vancouver voted 3-0 to provide notice to Vancouver Energy that its project must receive the necessary licenses, permits and approvals required to operate by 3/31/18 or the lease will be terminated.”

If terminated, the oil terminal proposal will be no more.
2217 2018-01-09 20:09:18 Rip. I've done this but with a bath oil mix which had almond oil.
2218 2018-01-09 20:09:13 Oil demand isn't limited to just the US.
2219 2018-01-09 20:09:09 Oil completed its objective of squeezing shorts > 2015 high 6258. Room to pullback.  Gold bullish, but also room to pullback for entry levels.
2220 2018-01-09 20:09:04 I let my hair breathe for 3 weeks , used Jamaican black castor oil , wild growth oil and just used heat protectant spray before blow drying/ straightening my hair.

2229 2018-01-09 20:07:53 More narrative. US domestic demand is mediocre. 2018 is here. Be careful ultra bull. I bet youre the type to be bullish (other than a day trade) in the higher 50s-lower 60s, and bearish in the higher 30s-lower 40s. Tisk tisk.....
2230 2018-01-09 20:07:51 And one of the reasons certainly is that enviros need to travel to exotic locations to scold the rest of us for our “excessive” oil use.
2231 2018-01-09 20:07:49 Oil seems way high now these companies were saying even at 38 little profits they are in the money now bet rigs start flying up seems build not in question

2243 2018-01-09 20:06:29 So always moisturize your skin with either an oil or like rose water. Then find a primer that minimizes pores only in your T zone and put a different primer on the perimeters of your face. Then once you apply your foundation set your entire face with translucent powder!!!!

2250 2018-01-09 20:05:41 I have been to UCSB, aka The Beach in the past few years, there is no oil or tar beaches. There are a lot of new liberals being created.  Amazing how professors who never actually held a real job try and brian wash our kids.
2251 2018-01-09 20:05:35 Take out sweets and bread eat more fruit with vitamins B C & E. Exfoliate with olive oil and suger scrub. You can do a Aztec mud mask with apple cider vinegar or honey, tumeric, and greek yogurt. All are home remedies. Do your research and keep a routine thats consistent.
2252 2018-01-09 20:05:34 It is in the future where you don't end up in recession and borrowing money when oil price drops next time. Like you did when the Cretin of Otuoke, @GEJonathan, lacked political will to save and decided to share the external reserves with other thieves and his market woman wife.
2253 2018-01-09 20:05:27 @senwarren: How often industries, like wars, are based on false pretenses requiring lies, bribes and Madison Avenue to stay afloat.
So the Tobacco Industry and Big Oil tell us "not to worry" while one is killing 100,000,000 people and the other, the Planet.

2274 2018-01-09 20:02:35 This "great demand" should not see such product builds. Once OPEC goes after its marketshare lost, you really think those crude inventories are going to be low? With what the EIA said today about US oil production?

2296 2018-01-09 20:00:28 Just learned that essential oils (pure oil or sometimes found in candles / used in diffusers) are TOXIC to animals with the exception of rosemary and frankincense.  So if you use a diffuser or sprinkle some on you/your bed, keep your animals away from them.

2311 2018-01-09 19:59:07 cual visión fundamental de LP? las petroleras son cíclicas y como cíclicas se comportan. Cuando oil a 100 el fundamental tambien era 45 LP. ese es el promedio histórico de LP... décadas.
2312 2018-01-09 19:58:53 Just like coal. The price is too low to chase offshore drilling. Unless we boycott saudi oil. Demand won't go there. Now if we really take off with 5% GDP growth then yes some investors will think about dabling in it. They will look around for a big reserve, that is it.

I have terrible sinus pressure. Currently trying tea tree oil and apple cider vinegar.

Any other recommendations please?

2319 2018-01-09 19:58:31 You never question it, yet it's been telling you thing's these past weeks that gets ignored. I hope you take seriously it's real time data that we'll get soon.
2320 2018-01-09 19:58:23 1. Use hot water 
2. Take Rhizin ir Citrizin after bathing 
3. You can take Cod liver oil also, it helps.
4. Wash your towels often and always allow it dry after using it
2321 2018-01-09 19:58:19 Oil money...
2322 2018-01-09 19:57:54 Americans like oil in their seafood & on their feet when they go to the beach. We don't need seagulls & other birds.
2323 2018-01-09 19:57:46 Not sure where I would be today without the love and support of peppermint oil.
2324 2018-01-09 19:57:38 I always stay away from watercolour and try paint with oil/acrylic but for some reason this makes me want to give it a go. Amazing portrait
2325 2018-01-09 19:57:27 I'm not sure but I know vitamin e oil helps a lot. Castor oil is very moisturizing and healing. I have to keep my cuticles trimmed weekly to keep them healthy

2327 2018-01-09 19:57:19 Man City CURRENTLY has 4 league titles compared to 20. Mancity CURRENTLY has 0 European Cups compared to 3. There is that present enough for you? Plus no need to argue with after oil money City fans who can't name 5 club legends and have Gallagher as a legend to represent

2331 2018-01-09 19:56:20 @CoralReefer420 do you empty that thing out on the bottom under the Evo base? I had no idea that was there until oil leaked out. Instructions woulda been nice lol
2332 2018-01-09 19:56:19 just an empty water bottle, food colouring, glitter /colured sand/ oil  etc. fill with water & glue lid on. Shake it up We comment how swirling colours are like or feelings - we cant see (hold up to look thru) but if we breathe the anger settles & we see clearly again - etc.
2333 2018-01-09 19:56:10 Net job creation has been dropping for decades. Nothing new. Why we need to cut down on and regulate immigration tighter than ever before
2334 2018-01-09 19:56:00 I'm not sure what your point is. He was put forth as "better than anyone we've had since" which I find a strange statement since his presidency really didn't accomplish anything. An oil embargo doesn't prevent domestic legislation
2335 2018-01-09 19:55:38 Oh yeah i def heard of double powdering so the powder absorbs the oil before it can get to the makeup ya
2336 2018-01-09 19:55:18 LOOK AT THE OIL COMING OUT OF THESE LILIES!!!!!!!!
2337 2018-01-09 19:55:07 This works well with peas as well. ##Mushypeas with less of the calories. Mixed broccoli and peas, even better. I use a food mixer to mush them up with a drop of oil.
2338 2018-01-09 19:55:01 An actress and media star gave a nice speech. We saw it it and thought 'good speech writing and delivery' - some of us thought - 'nice bandwagon-jumping you sleazy billionaire snake oil saleswoman'. I've heard good speeches before: meaningless without action.
2339 2018-01-09 19:54:53 I hate sitting for an oil change

2343 2018-01-09 19:54:29 Policies such as NAFTA, endless interventionist war for oil & influence, depletion of the middle class through diversion of resources to Wall Street & big business and continued impoverishment of working poor through outsourcing & dismantling of the social safety net.
2344 2018-01-09 19:54:29 Realized this morning that I need to change the oil in my car, and Alex told me to drive the Jeep tomorrow and he’ll take care of it. God I love this man 
2345 2018-01-09 19:54:29 2016: my hair is so oily I have to wash it
2017: u can’t make me wash my hair
2018: I can’t put enOUGH OIL INMY HAIR
2346 2018-01-09 19:54:28 Mood: smothering my face in bio oil
2347 2018-01-09 19:54:20 у меня наоборот. Серьёзно, мелкая только что пульнула в меня мандарином!
2348 2018-01-09 19:54:15 Officially a Dōterra rep! Message me for all of your aromatherapy and essential oil needs 
2349 2018-01-09 19:54:11 When my hair is extra dry or damaged I let coconut oil sit in it for 10-15 before I wash it. You can also make a body scrub out of coconut oil and sugar.
2350 2018-01-09 19:54:01 Chop into wedges slightly bigger than chips, then put on full power in microwave for 1.30 mins. Then on baking tray with bit of oil (only a little) then cook for about 25-30 mins in oven, Let them crisp up a tiny bit! Beautiful mate!
2351 2018-01-09 19:53:53 Really don't want to have to set up a system to centrifuge oilsand, or worse yet, use the oil drilling derricks.
2352 2018-01-09 19:53:47 Sorry to be the one to tell you but NO,we will NOT accept a parcel of lies and spin,this is the future of our children we are talking about here and Im going to fight to get scots away from Westminster,who have bankrupted a fucking oil rich country!
2353 2018-01-09 19:53:23 There were congressional hearings  in 1980s on climate change. CO2 levels went up markedly in the 70s. 

This has been a known issue for a long time & wasn’t “controversial” science until oil & coal lobbyists got hooks into congress.

It’s only controversial to fake scientists.
2354 2018-01-09 19:53:12 same ppl complaining about sanctuary and amnesty are the ones who dont care trump gives jobs to non Americans but want Americans to have jobs first. 
2355 2018-01-09 19:52:55 Using olive oil is a health decision, not race! Haha
2356 2018-01-09 19:52:36 Spoke to some cousins from China, not one knows what PEIWO is...Everyone speaks of all his accomplishments, but has anyone actually verified any of it? This guys selling snail oil man, sell!
2357 2018-01-09 19:52:25 Glad to see you're diluting your shot of albas oil. Potent stuff!
2358 2018-01-09 19:52:10 Does it have a bit of oil and some salt on it?
2359 2018-01-09 19:52:07 Brilliant to see a fellow Dietitian on the breakfast show, you did great @nicsnutrition, I love using coconut oil on my hair 
2360 2018-01-09 19:51:57 Help!

2361 2018-01-09 19:51:51 Finally got paid for the side hustle. Deva's money oil is unstoppable. We outchea in rare form!!
2362 2018-01-09 19:51:17 It is an important part of your day! What do you use your coconut oil for?!
2363 2018-01-09 19:51:04 Then why have relations with arab such bad people 2017 crowned prince of uae was the cheif guest of india at republic day why invite such heinous people to such events why goi doing this we buy so much oil from iran shouldn't we stop
2364 2018-01-09 19:51:04 Feel like I'm getting sick, but can't afford to get sick. Time to sleep when I can and oil it up
2365 2018-01-09 19:51:02 @JZarif Benjamin -Turks come The Turks do not get their place You do not get tired, Look for a secular revolution but do not steal the oil, it costs you a lot

2367 2018-01-09 19:50:56 With our economy in super doldrums thanks to the great visionary taking away my 1000 note and replacing it with 2000 , and oil prices on boil , from 2 - 18 months a stock market crash seems imminent.

2369 2018-01-09 19:50:43 There is real DROP of #crude happening in Venezuela which is another factor driving prices up. However, I do believe people are overreacting to these events and prices will correct. They will correct than 20% of all #crude bears will go #crude long..
2370 2018-01-09 19:50:40 Finally managed to get gregtech to work again, and now I'm having a hell of a time finding more oil in my world. Can't hit peak yet -- still need more energy to finish the nuclear reactors.
2371 2018-01-09 19:50:39 @mazdacanada just curious as to why the manual for our 2016 #Mazda 6 & CX5 state that an oil change in the USA can go anywhere from 7,500-10,000 miles (12,000-16,000 km), yet for Canada that number is only 8,000km. Both using synthetic oil. Why the large difference??
2372 2018-01-09 19:50:30 теперь я спокойна 
2373 2018-01-09 19:50:24 Use raw coconut oil every night, you won’t need anything during the day. Works wonders x
2374 2018-01-09 19:50:16 Goodnight.

From me and coconut oil.
2375 2018-01-09 19:50:15 Not buying - just sitting tight in the good positions already put in place during 2017. Agree with the euforia. Seems like most of the biotech and lots of oil related stocks are going crazy. Like a perfect storm ..

2383 2018-01-09 19:49:25 It's like mixing water and oil with this Diablo III's Necromancer and Demon Hunter 
2384 2018-01-09 19:49:14 Girl, me too. Cuticle oil is super cheap and really helps.
2385 2018-01-09 19:49:09 how many natural disasters need to happen before people realize global warming is making them worse and more frequent? how many people are going to die in the future because of oil industry profits?

2398 2018-01-09 19:47:57 Segment cauliflower into small florets, scatter on a roasting tray, season, sprinkle with olive oil, roast until browning and then enjoy!

2405 2018-01-09 19:47:27 just cauliflower florets, olive oil, seasoning. Can then add tomatoe puree if you want, then roast til you get delicious black bits
2406 2018-01-09 19:47:01 I love that joke!!! Sooo funny. Especially when the calculator spells oil by using the numbers 71 and 0 then turns upside down!! 
2407 2018-01-09 19:46:58 True Life: I’m addicted to olive oil
2408 2018-01-09 19:46:57 Damn I really had no motor oil in my shit I coulda been blown up
2409 2018-01-09 19:46:52 I live in Alaska and let me tell you about an oil spill that to this day still has consequences.
2410 2018-01-09 19:46:51 Instead of investigating this marine Gas oil issue , you suspending operations.. 
2411 2018-01-09 19:46:49 My oil change guy looks like Jesse Williams and he recognized me from the last time I was here 6 months ago. Shoot your shot 2018?
2412 2018-01-09 19:46:48 To get wages rising organically, cut into U6 numbers and get more Americans working, end illegal migration.
Tied into welfare/ entitlements
2413 2018-01-09 19:46:47 if your adding oil without draining anything then you need to put in the exact same oil. Conventional cannot go with synthetic
2414 2018-01-09 19:46:43 I need to get an oil change like today!!!
2415 2018-01-09 19:46:43 I know people who are prescribed CBD oil...
2416 2018-01-09 19:46:39 Recyclable plastic is not the way to go. Plastic is made from oil and requires a great deal of energy to recycle. A better solution would be to have compostable cups.
2417 2018-01-09 19:46:28 Why do you assume the people hired on an off-shore oil rig will be from Maine?

But the big concern is another large oil spill that could completely destroy Maine’s lobster and fishing industry.  The potential for a few more jobs is simply not worth it.
2418 2018-01-09 19:46:17 The market will take care of it eventually, but technology has been making it possible to tap new oil reserves. While we are using oil, I'd rather it be or own (or Canada's) instead of having to kowtow to the Middle East & others
2419 2018-01-09 19:46:09 CBD oil has replaced 4 prescription medications for me without side effects. I am more alert and energized. Same cost as prescriptions
2420 2018-01-09 19:46:05 Kudos to Jackie DeAngelis, CNBC’s  queen of everything oil. She speaks with such enunciation that she has to be loved by the deaf community.
2421 2018-01-09 19:45:55 South Indians still use coconut oil for everything !!!

2434 2018-01-09 19:44:29 You Liberals used to say No Wars over Middle East Oil, while Not allowing hardly ANY drilling in the homeland! Thank Goodness, we are nearly Energy Independent, NOW!! Now we can work our way toward alternative energy while having energy security, NO THANKS, TO YOU!!

2437 2018-01-09 19:44:04 From the NE Fishery Management Council Habitat Committee:

“The Habitat committee recommends that the Council oppose, in the strongest terms possible, offshore oil and gas development.”
2438 2018-01-09 19:43:55 Turns out my oil plug was stripped by the last people who changed it, and couldn’t go back in. Nearly caused me to have to stay here even longer because no one has that piece. Thankfully they came up with a solution and I’ll be back on the road in minutes.  Crisis averted.

2441 2018-01-09 19:43:07 They started running out of money as soon as Russia intervened and started bombing their oil shipments to Turkey. 

This was a couple of years ago now - do try to keep up.
2442 2018-01-09 19:43:06 @tdichristopher The U.S. oil glut isn't going down; it's just being refined. Products stockpiles are growing at a faster rate than crude stocks are declining.
2443 2018-01-09 19:43:01 Which oil skin are you talking about??? Even the  private sector skin or???
2444 2018-01-09 19:42:42 3 hours at Capitol ford Carson and counting. - for an oil change.

2449 2018-01-09 19:41:50 Liquidity in futures is still to low. If there is no robust market in futures, ETFs will be a disaster of epic proportions. It is not crude oil or gold yet, not even close. And not even biotech.

2463 2018-01-09 19:40:39 Get the skillet hot first, so that a drop of water dances around on it. Add your oil than your pre seasoned steak. Turn the heat down to medium high after a couple of minutes. Presto! Nice char on the outside juicy inside. Hope that helps!!

2473 2018-01-09 19:39:56 Exactly. 7 our of 10 voters may prefer her brand of Snake Oil to Trump’s, but it’s Snake Oil nonetheless.
2474 2018-01-09 19:39:55 I’m of the opinion that if we’re going to continue to be a nation that relies on oil, which we are and will be for the foreseeable future, it’s unjust to shift costs of its extraction to other (poor) nations.   Seeing the platforms off the coast may move people toward renewable.
2475 2018-01-09 19:39:49 In certain areas, wage growth is astronomical like #DataScience as I am sure in #Shale. One more factor in that labor shortage is fairly short boom and bust cycles. This who recall 2014/15 more hesitant now to come back to #shale as they are employed some place else #oott

2481 2018-01-09 19:39:18 @SubaruClearlake y’all still owe me a set of wheels since y’all curbed mine the last time I was in there for a oil change.
2482 2018-01-09 19:39:14 It's even worse now,, new potholes have emerged as oil surface was washed off
2483 2018-01-09 19:39:11 then yeah, general rule is 3,000 miles. Some cars have an oil life indicator, some just have a light that tells you when.
2484 2018-01-09 19:39:04 Sullivan: "I'm burning the midnight oil in getting the best players this club deserves. But I can't resist those loans and frees - this is OUR level and we're on our way up!
2485 2018-01-09 19:38:57 Most talk nonsense Rob, we have had so much good news and some commentators finally saying it could see a boost. With oil and the good news we have seen the share price has underperformed. Cya tomorrow buddy
2486 2018-01-09 19:38:51 It's also ahistorical to claim the oil sands "caused" the recession, or that the oil sands were Harper's. Alberta under an NDP government still recognizes the importance of oil to Alberta's and Canada's economy, for example.

We suffered from lack of diversification, no question.
2487 2018-01-09 19:38:50 $BX should benefit from higher oil with its recent investment in the Permian Basin
2488 2018-01-09 19:38:49 omg same! i use a serum, an oil and a moisturizer during the winter time.
2489 2018-01-09 19:38:44 I had no idea fish oil helps with lowering blood pressure! Gonna go get some ASAP. 
2490 2018-01-09 19:38:44 She's one of the many faces of modern "Religion". Snake oil sales. They don't even have the cost of phony bottle of oil, your soul is free but they capture your mind.
2491 2018-01-09 19:38:42 Coconut oil! But a very thin amount since he doesn’t have a curl to soak it in as much.
2492 2018-01-09 19:38:41 @JChatterleyBBG Re: Oil Prices.  I humbly observed the oil inventory in Cushing as gone down to the lowest levels since 2/15 (per EIA).  The trend appears to be crude drifting upwards.

2494 2018-01-09 19:38:22 put count oil , an a egg or 2 mix it together leave it in ur hair over night it helps it get the shiny texture back !!
2495 2018-01-09 19:38:11 So they can watch the oil deep into the ocean after ANWR spills start happening?
2496 2018-01-09 19:38:07 It's not about saving the environment or not needing the oil. It's all about keeping the USA reliant on Saudi Arabia...Isn't that right Dianne?

2500 2018-01-09 19:37:47 I still haven't went to get my oil changed
2501 2018-01-09 19:37:45 So you hang on to the data you like only? By the way, estimates by various sources are all over the place. The EIA is best in real time data. Let's see if you respect such data in the months ahead.
2502 2018-01-09 19:37:42 Modern helicopters have a lot of protection, though some electronic systems might take a hit. The protections came after one carrying oil rig workers to a North Sea platform got hit and had to ditch in the ocean.
2503 2018-01-09 19:37:38 I'm just hoping the oil tanker on fire in the China Sea doesn't explode, we got rid of the funds to help with oil spill disasters. oops, #FactsMatter
2504 2018-01-09 19:37:29 Gotta Buy Sand Oil!
2505 2018-01-09 19:37:24  Jealousy gets you nowhere my dear. Now go get an early night. The Massey Ferguson has an oil change in the morning 
2506 2018-01-09 19:37:17 No reason to own a major in a up market. Will significantly underperform mid cap oil. Relative performance more a technical indicator, I think
2507 2018-01-09 19:37:10 y'all need to try oil cleansing omg i started it a few days ago and its the best thing i ever did to my skin, its clearing up and getting so much better i'm so happy

2512 2018-01-09 19:36:31 Arthur, I'm surprised at you leaving an empty plug socket switched on. A potential deathtrap, especially with Olbas oil & Ibruleve around. Tsk
2513 2018-01-09 19:36:27 I'll always have the back of my fav essential oil company so I definitely put my vote in for y'all!!!!

2518 2018-01-09 19:36:14 Got an oil change and my cars driving great 
2519 2018-01-09 19:36:08 California pays some of the highest prices in the country for gas. More oil could help reduce those prices. Or do you prefer to keep oil prices inflated  because California has super high taxes on gasoline?
2520 2018-01-09 19:36:01 I'm guessing you live in California. Move to Texas, our oil come right to us. Also natural gas the cleanest form of heat. Of course our little shacks don't cost a million dollars and we're not a Billion $$ in debt or have a Governor that's taking us to hell in a hand basket.

2524 2018-01-09 19:35:38 Alex, I read your article on the coming bull market in oil a month ago did some more research and loved the idea. I am 8% in USO rn. I am just mad I didn't take s bigger position. "It takes guts to be a big." - Druck
2525 2018-01-09 19:35:30 If only. But it is not going to happen ever. Because of Peak Oil, Peak Coal, Peak Gas & Peak Uranium Industrial Civilisation is beginning to collapse
2526 2018-01-09 19:35:20 "B-but, all of those so called ethical energy companies say that natural gas is clean!"

2527 2018-01-09 19:35:11 I've been saying their demand estimates were low. Now they're more in line with my expectation. And I've never said EIA was wrong.

2532 2018-01-09 19:34:22 Just knocked over my maracuja oil and spilled some of it . Good thing I bought the big one and it was only like an 8th of the bottle

2534 2018-01-09 19:34:03 Can TLW push through 240 tomorrow on a good update,many saying it's already priced in. I think with oil price at this level everyone waiting for a lower buy in might have missed the boat. #tlw #tullow

2536 2018-01-09 19:33:51 You need to do more reading on #BasicIncome funding.
In #Estonia they fund it via a flat tax. #Alaska uses oil revenue
2537 2018-01-09 19:33:48 I told myself not to bring pesto pasta to work because the oil and my tum just don’t get along but here I am, consumed pesto and now real sick
2538 2018-01-09 19:33:47 I meant oil 
2539 2018-01-09 19:33:38 Either way the earth isn't dying we're just killing it. And it's not going to stop until we stop using outdated technology to do shit. We don't need oil or coal anymore to power things anymore yet we still do
2540 2018-01-09 19:33:37 For my more mechanically inclined friends, I have to ask:

Do I really need an oil change every 3 months?
2541 2018-01-09 19:33:34 Aaahhhhh yes. The low unemployment with no good wage growth in decades.
2542 2018-01-09 19:33:15 The man dnt have a woman ... is oil inns him back mek him hold her like that innuh

2546 2018-01-09 19:33:02 @POTUS If you want to continue to see economic growth, find a way to cap oil prices before people get scared of $3 gas again. Hurts the pocketbook too much.
2547 2018-01-09 19:32:59 jojoba oil changed my life
2548 2018-01-09 19:32:39 Some could make the argument that by extracting more oil at home we don't need to rely on ME oil as much but after the deep water horizon disaster we can't have that ever occur again. I certainly don't want that to occur at my coast.
2549 2018-01-09 19:32:38 Maybe oil and gas have deeper pockets.
2550 2018-01-09 19:32:37 I’m adulting so hard today. I had my air ducts “cleaned” for the mold in the apartment, scheduled appointment to get them redone because they’re old af, currently getting oil changed, going to pick up sister from school, and get textbooks for college.

2552 2018-01-09 19:32:28 So many people are completely oblivious to the fact that most of job growth is really just the lost oilfield jobs coming back. The only stimulus to the Alberta economy is the price of oil hitting 60$ a barrel. Fucking ndp sheep tho

2570 2018-01-09 19:30:56 I got a bracelet for Christmas that's basically a mini, portable essential oil diffuser. If my nose gets stuffy, I hold it up to my nose and suddenly, I can breathe. It's pretty dope but I feel like I look like I'm snorting coke when I sniff at it. Not a good look while at work.
2571 2018-01-09 19:30:45 Cas acts like he’s choking to death every time he eats his teeny pill, the ear drops make him look mangy, the other two cats are like sharks bc he gets special food, and I’m oiling him up more bc I’m putting vitamin e oil on his paws.

2583 2018-01-09 19:29:23 The Government needs to be supportive of renewables in the transport sector, displacing finite fossil fuels, in line with their ambitions to lower CO2 + pollution. Oil companies won’t choose to do this themselves.
2584 2018-01-09 19:29:08 Exposing olive oil & coconut oil to heat changes the molecular structure rather cook with avocado oil or grape seed oil

2617 2018-01-09 19:26:04 That's not terrible logic, but we've been hearing about this since late 2016. We're now starting 2018, and US oil production is here big and strong.
2618 2018-01-09 19:26:02 Coconut oil >>>
2619 2018-01-09 19:26:01 Coconut oil has done wonders for my skin and hair lol
2620 2018-01-09 19:25:44 Quit selling snake oil , how about the Clinton foundation hhhmmmm a lot of dirt there
2621 2018-01-09 19:25:41 Hmmm we were first taking about probability. Now we are talking about labour shortage.  Next we will probably talk about cheesecake
2622 2018-01-09 19:25:25 voting fraud and oil reserves?
2623 2018-01-09 19:25:11 Trump is determined 2 repeal all restrictions that protect the environment - rules are the enemy of developers, oil, gas coal  etc
2624 2018-01-09 19:25:03 IQ45 is a total phony. His family crest should have a bottle of snake oil.
2625 2018-01-09 19:24:47 apparently the AHA just declared war on coconut oil lmao

kinda unnecessary just a bit 
2626 2018-01-09 19:24:25 Obvs
But Man City’s team is built from oil dollar innit
2627 2018-01-09 19:24:16 Got oil based drilling mud in my mouth today. 0/10 would recommend
2628 2018-01-09 19:24:10 Snake oil salesman. His friend from News Max made a fool of himself...!
2629 2018-01-09 19:24:02 Hungary built a wall. Illegal migration went from thousands a day to around 1, 000 a year. 
Walls work.
2630 2018-01-09 19:24:02 That mean it was working! It’s also a great detox RT @PineappleGC: @DamnKojack @ThatDamnTwerk1 Probably oil pulling. I used to do that until it started making me feel sick.
2631 2018-01-09 19:23:47 Seems like I’m constantly due for a oil change  i blame those trips back and forth to Tally
2632 2018-01-09 19:23:24 The Iranian company whose oil tanker burst into flames after a collision in the East China Sea says there is still hope of finding survivors.
2633 2018-01-09 19:23:23 I mean technically none of the beauty stuff is related to our industry, but we stretch it to get samples (and do beauty blogs/gift guides). I did get coconut oil from them!
2634 2018-01-09 19:23:12 Well yeah, you don't want to leave it in the car. No telling if any would be left after the oil change
2635 2018-01-09 19:22:56 Next, the moat with piranhas and big pots of boiling oil. Heck, why not trebuchets firing invaders back over the wall by the buckets?? If only dragons were real..
2636 2018-01-09 19:22:48 Oil pull. Use like mouth wash but for at least 5 minutes , brush your teeth after... look at your results in like a week RT @DamnKojack: @ThatDamnTwerk1 @PineappleGC How u use it as a teeth whitener?
2637 2018-01-09 19:22:42 Had a white chocolate mocha and the one time I don't bring my peppermint oil with me I really need it because that was sickly sweet and I'm getting a headache =/
2638 2018-01-09 19:22:41 Washing out the vocal chords with honey, lemon and ginger in hot water will help.
Likewise inhaling olbas oil infused with boiling water will loosen the sinuses.
Try it.
2639 2018-01-09 19:22:21 Um right, how many oil wells are going up?
2640 2018-01-09 19:22:16 I have grapefruit, cinnamon leaf, patchouli and ylang ylang in my oil burner, beautiful piano melodies playing, and I’m truly living my best life right now 
2641 2018-01-09 19:22:12 Not much. They just speculated about China and India. Wait. Didn't you bulls keep claiming how wrong EIA estimates on supply and demand usually are? And now to your convince you're hanging to it?
2642 2018-01-09 19:22:03 I bought the large olive oil too... in Sainsbury’s
2643 2018-01-09 19:21:58 Isn't Fegitz and Pirani a brand of olive oil?
2644 2018-01-09 19:21:44 Yes girl biotin and fish oil pills 
2645 2018-01-09 19:21:40 Sugar was behind the cash register (had to ask around) olive & vegetable oil behind lock & key. Woman next to me in line asked if she could put my purchase on her card to take my bill (worth less than a dollar) as hard cash even harder to find #caracas
2646 2018-01-09 19:21:31 THE OIL
2647 2018-01-09 19:21:22 Well if we can only minimise our dependence on oil, why bother at all right?
2648 2018-01-09 19:21:03 4.  DIY hair masks are really effective. I use eggs, olive oil and honey.
2649 2018-01-09 19:21:02 I get the motor to my window fixed and then i get an oil change and then i need my tires filled and then i need more coolant and then i need
2650 2018-01-09 19:21:02 Avacado toast with coconut oil and salt
2651 2018-01-09 19:20:51 so i took my car to get an oil change but then several things were wrong with my car so it went from a $60 bill to a $1,606 bill and then i went to the dentist (ps im the queen of clean teeth and nothing going wrong) and i have to get 3 fillings which cost $300..so uh..sorry dad
2652 2018-01-09 19:20:50 A sense of hopelessness and emptiness invades #Venezuela... empty shelves empty streets empty roads even empty gas stations no cash soon running out of oil.. the country is dying away.. #oott
2653 2018-01-09 19:20:44 Might not be hot enough due to the room temp. Oil viscosity is affected by ambient temps.
2654 2018-01-09 19:20:30 How dare these oil companies provide a product that people want and take the same tax deduction for R&D just as every other company is entitled to. May I suggest you stop using oil byproducts to prove you are not a hypocrite?
2655 2018-01-09 19:20:21 Lemon oil has to be the best
See me smelling like chewing gum
2656 2018-01-09 19:20:18 And "C", protect our air and water and soil from pollutants.  Protect our coasts from careless oil production and transportation.

2658 2018-01-09 19:19:58 So I have an Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser and I’ve been giving each oil a trial run. I used Tea Tree Oil last night. It smells AWFUL. Still has my room smelling like a stuffy warehouse. And to top it off I woke up feeling sick 
2659 2018-01-09 19:19:44 Thanks for narrowing it down. All instances of "Uganda" is earning blah blah blah from Gold, hides, oil etc should be replaced with Museveni

2667 2018-01-09 19:18:17 IT'S  DISGUSTING. LEAVE THE LANDS ALONE, LEAVE NATURE ALONE, WHY KILL EVETYTHING FOR THE SAKE OF SOME BECOMING RICHER. THERE'S OTHER WAYS OF PRODUCING ENERGY,  WITHOUT SACRIFICING WILD LIFE. THUS GREED EILL FINISH WITH HUMAN KIND TWO. THEN WHAT WILL OIL DO WITH NO ONE TO BUY IT.
2668 2018-01-09 19:17:59 He really hasn’t a clue. Thinks coal is a big winner and we still get income from oil. 
2669 2018-01-09 19:17:57 No amount of bio oil in the world can save me from my stretch marks 
2670 2018-01-09 19:17:56 If you think rain in SF is a problem, you should try LA. It's like end times down there when it rains. (And yes, the oil buildup is a real problem - I never spun my wheels until I drove in LA in rain.)
2671 2018-01-09 19:17:52 Just trying to help. I didn't know if they needed a new person to massage oil onto the hunks or something
2672 2018-01-09 19:17:30 Did you see their new demand estimates though?
2673 2018-01-09 19:17:20 . He wan try the "tell and do" magic palm oil wey baba give am when he go village during festive period. He know know say issa scam 
2674 2018-01-09 19:17:20 Liar liar pants on fire! Don't trust this snake oil salesman. They tell a great story then do the opposite of their words & what we need & want for our country. Trump breaks down America, not once has he build it up! A builder that never builds. This is his presidency!#tearitdown
2675 2018-01-09 19:17:11 Be ready to bump off that oil

2677 2018-01-09 19:17:06 Well done Ross maybe you should concentrate on finding were your big chief misslaid the peadophile ring papers of the corrupt mp's in the tories, stop privatising the NHS in England stop creating more austerity and people who rely on food banks and stop giving our oil away as wel
2678 2018-01-09 19:17:03 ACV and coconut oil cure everything tho RT @PineappleGC: I been told to put bleach, egg yolk, coconut oil, lime, acv, hot compress on my armpit lol.

2684 2018-01-09 19:16:39 Yes i dont think this is a short term top. This is deep. This is at major levels regarding shale oil, tensions in russia, iran & dollar shortages will lead countries to over pump. Huge hedging will alllow shale to up production. And positioning suggests this is gna be painful
2685 2018-01-09 19:16:23 Yep. That’s why we stopped trying to forecast those Macro data a few years ago and focused on oil stats, trade/external balance (ability to pay) which are a bit more available and slightly checkable against trading partners. Though there are a lot of good unofficial cpi sources
2686 2018-01-09 19:16:16 Oleg Erovinkin, a former general in the KGB, then FSB, was found dead in the back of his car in Moscow on Boxing Day in mysterious circumstances.

Erovinkin was a key aide to Igor Sechin, now head of Rosneft, the state-owned oil company, who is repeatedly named in the dossier.
2687 2018-01-09 19:16:16 @KatyTurNBC Trump plays media like violin. Plays role of boss surrounded by syncophants & media in awe/dumbstruck he can play boss. Worked 30yrs adult psych. Had oil executive bossing everyone/complaining.  Mental testing showed he needed 24hr supervision. Boss very easy role!
2688 2018-01-09 19:16:09 At this price it is running out and not the right type of oil Sheesh! don’t you guys ever listen?
Fortunately we have London to take care of this pesky stuff no need for us to worry about it.
2689 2018-01-09 19:16:07 Stop flying and driving and letting truck deliver to stores and maybe then we won’t need the oil until then drill
2690 2018-01-09 19:15:49 @realDonaldTrump 
Democrats don't want an agreement. They are Snake Oil salesmen. They always talk out of both sides of their mouths and still they say nothing. DEPORT all 12 million and we never have to talk about this crap again. Not that hard.
2691 2018-01-09 19:15:47 @CapstoneTurbine $CPST another turd, oil hitting highs not seen since 2014, drilling and frac crews cant work fast enough, there turbines are used by oil & gas companies, but they are doing the upgrade sell company shares bs, lol
2692 2018-01-09 19:15:38 I will not buy any product from any oil company that drills off the coast of California.
2693 2018-01-09 19:15:24 Thats what I did. One for us, one for the neighbours but like you doesn't last long. Have you tried dipping in roasted pumpkin oil rather than olive oil ?? Yum yum !!

2696 2018-01-09 19:15:06 And also people like Hollywood scum like Fonda too come to Canada and attack our oil and gas workers while using very products to get here but tell public essential life gas CO2 is bad and we have to live in Stone Age
2697 2018-01-09 19:14:49 Why assume mineral extraction involves destruction of natural environment? This is emotive ignoring that we need minerals (& use them wisely) Properly done fracking or other extraction of oil/gas causes v little damage. But then I'm the only vicar who has supervised a drillrig
2698 2018-01-09 19:14:45 The whole "costs follow price" narrative started by Pierce Andurand keeps getting repeated. Bottom line, US oil production is climbing, and in less than a month, it could be at 10 million. This EIA report today was bearish.
2699 2018-01-09 19:14:44 Это хорошо
2700 2018-01-09 19:14:40 1. Use hot water 
2. Take Rhizin ir Citrizin after bathing 
3. You can take Cod liver oil also, it helps.
4. Wash your towels often and always allow it dry after using it

2702 2018-01-09 19:14:19 So much for being for the forgotten folks- special interests wins again! Who cares forgotten folks will pay for damages and health issues but special interests will take in the dough selling our oil to CHINA. It’s not for us y’all.
2703 2018-01-09 19:14:11 100% owned lincenses with no proven resource. I remember a small aim oil company next to the  big oil plays and they found oil, but there was too much sand in the pipelines to make it commercial.  Until it's proven by a proper research  report, crack on sunshine 

2704 2018-01-09 19:14:06 1/2 Last week, Sec. Zinke announced a draft plan to open up more offshore territory for energy exploration. I don't support offshore oil & gas exploration in states that don't want it & WA's citizens have never indicated any desire to have oil and gas activity off their coast.

2707 2018-01-09 19:13:55 Totally against this.  I live in Florida and saw first hand the terrible results if an oil leak and fire in the gulf.
2708 2018-01-09 19:13:43 We need water pipelines, not oil.
2709 2018-01-09 19:13:39 My jacket smells like tea tree oil
2710 2018-01-09 19:13:32 Oil too? because my elderly friend ran out, I was on hold 2hrs to talk to someone about it, and they weren't going to get her any for another 3 days despite her annual contract.
2711 2018-01-09 19:13:24 why can't you saute in water? can't share your recipe cause you saute in coconut oil
2712 2018-01-09 19:13:22 Indeed. #SQZ looks as good an investment now as it did at 27p pre BKR deal imho. And oil and gas looking extremely strong. Wonder if BP likes our Namibian block for a jv/farm in. They know this area well.

2721 2018-01-09 19:12:35 Never going to @meinekecarcare for anything again.! Simple oil change, they dismantle my car and now ii keep having issues 
2722 2018-01-09 19:12:28 It's the easiest way to order from Amazon.  It the price of oil was $1,000/barrel then oil companies would subsidize the sale of low MPG vehicles.

2725 2018-01-09 19:12:09 1. The inversion method: Heat up an oil of your choice, I use olive oil.  Apply the oil to your scalp and tip your head upside down while massaging it, this stimulates your follicles. This method increases blood flow to your head, which triggers hair growth.

Too many white working class voters were unhappy about their own economic situations and they were willing to buy a crate of snake oil in hopes it would improve their outlook. Never mind that it was the same old repackaged snake oil.
2758 2018-01-09 19:09:25 Will they be able to monitor the environmental destruction that results from more oil drilling?
2759 2018-01-09 19:09:19 It is going to be less profitable due to labor/equipment rise in cost & physical shortage
2760 2018-01-09 19:09:16 Go to get my oil changed and dude tells me there’s 4 other major problems with my car. Bitch I just wanted an oil change.
2761 2018-01-09 19:09:13 I’d to use a popular brand name of oil delivery people, Rochelle doesn’t normally use them. I doubt we’d use them again now tbh !!
2762 2018-01-09 19:09:13 So accelerate the adoption of EVs and the oil requirement will drop. Just like with coal.
Govt has been extremely slow in pushing EVs and the technology is completely ready as demonstrated by Tesla. Car companies are just lazy and resistant to change!
2763 2018-01-09 19:09:08 TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum and Sukari Baby Facial with the Marula Luxury Facial Oil!!
2764 2018-01-09 19:08:53 when you take your car to get an oil change and they tell you you need 2000 dollars worth of work on your car 
2765 2018-01-09 19:08:43 It doesn't look like I'm gonna be able to get online until tonight but I'll see you guys later!!

glitter oil tonight...?
2766 2018-01-09 19:08:43 Misplaced my vaseline  and this coconut oil is not even hydration my lips
2767 2018-01-09 19:08:42 Не надо так. Это делает мне больно
2768 2018-01-09 19:08:34 So someone cut off the lock on our oil tank in our college house and drained all the oil. I'm cold and sad and cold :(
2769 2018-01-09 19:08:29 Realist thing I ever read: “People pray for the cake. Then God gives them the batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan, an oven, they get get frustrated and leave the kitchen.” Let that sink. Sometimes you have everything right in front of you, but how bad do you want it ?
2770 2018-01-09 19:08:09 WEALTH, Water, coconut oil, good dick, and even better vibes is all i need
2771 2018-01-09 19:08:06 Holy crap  The oil guy here puts it in and checks for airlocks FOR NOTHING.!!
2772 2018-01-09 19:07:59 What? No NPS helicopter to commandeer? No oil company jet? Poor baby.
2773 2018-01-09 19:07:59 Да я была маленькой и глупой
Мы с сестрой на пару закинулись. Она не так много, как я, поэтому она относительно быстро поправилась, а я лежала и лежааала в реанимации
2774 2018-01-09 19:07:51 R u putting it around the oil rigs that u allowed in the ocean?
2775 2018-01-09 19:07:40 Yeah but then you'd walk around smelling of castor oil.

This, at least, lets you smell good!
2776 2018-01-09 19:07:35 FFP ??BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
 Maybe the owners brother has used an oil states national reserves to fund a company to sponsor Wolves!  It works for Citeh!
2777 2018-01-09 19:07:31 LOL! I actually took castor oil earlier this year for the first time ever. Won't be a frequent thing though :)
2778 2018-01-09 19:07:31 So you’re saying shale is not profitable?
2779 2018-01-09 19:07:27 Myself a disabled veteran and I absolutely abhor the ridiculous and pathetically called  health care i have been given.  But heyyy nobody gives an honest fk about such.  Except when they need someone to bleed and die for poppy fields or gas n oil pipelines
2780 2018-01-09 19:07:21 I wonder what Romans actually did with the olive oil...
2781 2018-01-09 19:07:16 White people make weed legal !! Now it’s cool to smoke oil even your Dominican mom is okay with it !! But before all this you were a monster if u rolled an L I don’t get it
2782 2018-01-09 19:07:13 @Ocado absolutely horrified you are on the worst rated supermarket list due the use of palm oil. Only way to make companies stop this abhorrent behaviour is to vote with your feet. #goodbye #shameful
2783 2018-01-09 19:07:03 Eh  castor oil works wonders
2784 2018-01-09 19:06:57 I currently have rose, jasmine and lavender essential oil going through my oil diffuser right now and omfg  heavenly

2787 2018-01-09 19:06:32 Oil service companies are a good way to lose your shirts
2788 2018-01-09 19:06:18 Yam and palm oil, food for champions
2789 2018-01-09 19:06:17 How about she is a snake oil salesman profiting from the harmful pseudoscience of Dr. Oz?
2790 2018-01-09 19:06:05 ESPECIALY important for when the oil spills from all that drilling you seem to want to happen in ANWR.
2791 2018-01-09 19:05:52 I used coconut oil mixed with pepper mint oil to get rid of Keira and Peteys! It takes time and you have to put it on every day for a week or so but it works better than the drops:)
2792 2018-01-09 19:05:29 Are EVs a threat to future oil&gas demand or opportunity? A. ICEs will need fuel for a long time.   Markets will evolve esp globally. #SOAE2018
2793 2018-01-09 19:05:09 Look @CarolineHirons blog, for superb advice.
Spend yr £/$ on a serum or oil, not a moisturiser.

2794 2018-01-09 19:05:08 Made some toast with peanut butter but used coconut oil on one piece instead of butter. Am I healthy now?
2795 2018-01-09 19:04:59 Complicated business deals,especially in the oil and gas sector take time , legality and red tape can sometimes distort timescales ,however I still expect the final cake to taste the same no matter how much mud is thrown at it GLA
2796 2018-01-09 19:04:56 : just woke up w/ a blocked nose, dabbed some “sinus clear” essential oil on my philtrum - nose is clear, burnt like a curry arsehole though 
2797 2018-01-09 19:04:50 Blue MGBGT here. Sometimes the car would stall because the electronic fuel pump would cut out. I then would bang it with a rock to get it going again. Plus, we found that replacing the fluid in the shocks with castor oil kept them working so you didn’t have to buy new shocks.
2798 2018-01-09 19:04:45 I’m taking an oil painting class this semester and I’m kinda excited, but also terrified.

2800 2018-01-09 19:04:31 I find 3 pillows help a huge deal when you're stuffed up. Plenty of olbas oil and a cool bedroom (but cozy duvet) helps xx
2801 2018-01-09 19:04:25 You cant say that for sure. Hemp oil is banned in my country. Many people have benefited from it. Its billion $ industry. Anythings possible

2806 2018-01-09 19:04:08 I went to undergrad at UCSB. You could not walk on the beach without scraping a layer of tar off your feet every single time because of the oil spill that occurred decades earlier.  The loss of wildlife was incessant. This is heartbreaking and regressive in the extreme.
2807 2018-01-09 19:03:59 oil stocks not even positive today
2808 2018-01-09 19:03:46 i know how to change the oil, i know how to mix the gas but i can’t crash, skrrt i’m on my ass

2815 2018-01-09 19:03:32 Oil wasn’t delivered yesterday, I rang them @ 14.00 and they said it would be here today. Waited all day, 14.30 rang the delivery guy who asked would I be ok till tomorrow. I explained I’ve been without heat since last Wednesday. He grudgingly delivered it @ 16.00, hallelujah ..

2821 2018-01-09 19:02:57 Someone’s about to lose their oil change money privileges.
2822 2018-01-09 19:02:55 Why are oil people and like cable guys always late?? They’ll be like I’ll be there between 10-11, then it’s 4pm and ur still waiting on them
2823 2018-01-09 19:02:51 Do your thing boys. Stick to your basics, your system & perfect it. Don’t do anything extra ordinary. This is yours from here on. Oil country is frustrated, but has not stopped standing behind you. We’re still HOPEFUL. F I G H T!!!
2824 2018-01-09 19:02:42 I'm back on my JBCO... I mix it with olive oil and rose water to seal... but my loves are Kinky Curly Not today leave-in and custard. For shampoo & deep conditioner I use the Shea moisture manukah honey oil line.

2830 2018-01-09 19:02:08 So if coal and oil are so good why do they need subsidies?
2831 2018-01-09 19:02:06 Yes, that would work, I think. Or mixing a bit of oil in with it.
2832 2018-01-09 19:01:52 Does caster oil actually help eyelashes and eyebrows grow thicker or?

Because of high rate of diesel people are using CNG and rail use electricity

2857 2018-01-09 18:59:31 Dogging a waterfall outside my office door.  Soapy water collecting in trash cans.  So much fun working in an old building.  Grabbed my oil print off the wall in time.
2858 2018-01-09 18:59:21 Security = Ridiculous wall to fulfill campaign promise to racist zealots so he could try to secure a 2020 vote from them.

2862 2018-01-09 18:58:54 @coopukfood @coopuk Why do you always have problems with offers? Just brought some olive oil which should have been £3 but got charged £6! Only realised when I got home when I checked receipt! I always have trouble at my local coop too! Sort It
2863 2018-01-09 18:58:53 Deep condition it regularly. Then use a daily leave in and top with oil. Moisturize will make it softer.
2864 2018-01-09 18:58:47 4% of all oil production is used to make plastics, probably why we make disposable objects out of non biodegradable material.

2866 2018-01-09 18:58:33 He lost that gig late last year. The oil company's share price had plummeted, so perhaps they could no longer afford his questionable 'value-adding' services. I'm more concerned about his other conflicts of interest, but obv the PM isn't  
2867 2018-01-09 18:58:30 Delhi not Safe ? Be aware.
Today my driver was told to check oil is leaking.when he got down 4 bags were stolen within minutes during day at 12.30 pm in front  of green park metro station near Adiva hosp .no show from police ?
2868 2018-01-09 18:58:27 Oil works great too :)

2871 2018-01-09 18:58:01 Hausa vendors have mastered the art of selling fruits. They wash it extra clean, some even rub oil so it would catch your eyes when the sun hits it just right, then stack it properly on their wheelbarrows and finally position themselves strategically at the best junctions.

2875 2018-01-09 18:57:32 How much of that $18B will line his own & cronies' pockets? Dumb? Or just corrupt? (Same with climate denial, btw. Oil in the ground worthless if ppl switch to renewables).

2890 2018-01-09 18:55:32 Also a problem with the API grade produced by shale... Getting lighter and lighter - 50% of new shale oil is above 45 API!!!

2895 2018-01-09 18:55:21 Thanks for your opinion, but it really doesn’t make sense. Your not a big club because you can’t  fill out your stadium properly, your not a big club just because you got bought out by an oil billionaire. Big clubs have history, which you don’t.

2899 2018-01-09 18:55:06 Oil on the fire, unfortunately.
2900 2018-01-09 18:54:50 You really don’t have a clue, do you? Oil? How much revenue does it bring in? You don’t know. Coal? Who’s mining much coal? Gas? Same as oil
2901 2018-01-09 18:54:37 I’m glad he’s back cuz tomorrow I’m going but I feel bad for him as those losses were not all him. The defense for the oil has not been....good. He’s an NHL goalie he’ll be back
2902 2018-01-09 18:54:21 David Watts - the ftse is historically weighted to commodities and the FTSE could go further as oil moves higher
2903 2018-01-09 18:54:15 please tell me why i have been at the dealership since 12:15 for an oil change and i'm still here???? @NissanUSA i have other things to do!!!!
2904 2018-01-09 18:54:04 Something like the Lucas Oil stadium would be fantastic for us
2905 2018-01-09 18:53:57 #ockhicyclone nothing done by this navy and oil spill in ennore used bucket to clean..and yet powerful navy funny...
2906 2018-01-09 18:53:49 Can the wonderful hard working people in the media explain why Wolff has been 24/7 news and ‘next to nothing’ about offshore drilling restrictions having been slashed, a per barrel tax to help in oil disasters has been cut with GOP tax bill, has little or no coverage
Shameful
2907 2018-01-09 18:53:44 Swamp needs to be drained, government downsized. But giving so much power to military and to oil and gas interests is feeding major occupants of the Swamp.
2908 2018-01-09 18:53:44 Rather like the radio silence we now have regarding the rising oil price. Despite wall to wall wailing of ‘rock bottom price’ and ‘scarcity’ prior to indyref.
2909 2018-01-09 18:53:39 She was using sythetic fragrances labeled essential oil. As long as the cat can escape CPTG oils are safe to difuse
2910 2018-01-09 18:53:30 Right, all big players shift focus on #shale, making it expensive to frack and deliver hense making #shale oil expensive... unless there is a breakthrough that goes above 2% efficiency for each rig
2911 2018-01-09 18:53:28 @NancyPelosi Only saw a minute of the GOP Presser  A few words about bipartisan work which might be interesting if true. The problem is habitual GOP lying to Amer ppl! Did you notice that your tax scam included eliminating the 9 cent/barrel emergency fund for oil disasters?
2912 2018-01-09 18:53:26 super thanks so much. i will take a look.
2913 2018-01-09 18:53:13 We already have boatloads of oil. What we need is renewables.
2914 2018-01-09 18:53:09 RT if you ever: heard your mom tell you that "Hot Cheetos" were made with rat oil.... just so you would stop eating them so much 
2915 2018-01-09 18:53:06 Really enjoyed Film today at Crawley Cinema with KC - 'All the money in the World' about the oil barren Paul Getty.
2916 2018-01-09 18:53:02 Trump says we need more Cole mines and oil pipelines !
2917 2018-01-09 18:52:54 oil diffusers are so soothing and relaxing, everyone needs one ASAP
2918 2018-01-09 18:52:31 I want to live in possum park. Think of the sawdust and machine oil smells! Mmmm
2919 2018-01-09 18:52:26 no, we are running out of US oil so bad, and its going to 200$s soon.
2920 2018-01-09 18:52:18 Have fun selling Google's corporate snake oil. Remember, you are not their customer; you are their product.
2921 2018-01-09 18:52:00 OOOF: WTI crude oil hits $63/bbl
2922 2018-01-09 18:51:51 @JenaAsciutto1  Ed Sheeran and Machine gun Kelly are like oil and water.
2923 2018-01-09 18:51:50 Thank you for the post.  Looks like Oil will continue to rise and stabilize around the 70$ range.  GL
2924 2018-01-09 18:51:45 Don’t it’s full of palm oil which will damage you! Have galaxy or Lindt!!

2926 2018-01-09 18:51:22 You need a few brushes. Get some natural shit. I use Black Soap and coconut oil / shea butter

2930 2018-01-09 18:50:57 Let red border states fund it, they get oil from the land now upkeep it.
2931 2018-01-09 18:50:52 クリアおめでとうございます！(^o^)
2932 2018-01-09 18:50:36 U se Oil too? 
2933 2018-01-09 18:50:33 hmm okay if that’s real i’m here for it  & tea tree oil is good for scaring, i use grease lightning from lush & girl it is very much worth it! it’s a tea tree & aloe gel that’s really good for your oils in general
2934 2018-01-09 18:50:23 terima kasih amirul (oil) . muaahhh. lanje aku bistro pls. hahaha
2935 2018-01-09 18:49:57 Again, we may already be at 10 million. There is nothing bullish about this. The whole "OMG demand!" narrative seems to be the excuse for rising prices.
2936 2018-01-09 18:49:52 We find it annoying that it’s not their fault when oil crashed and economy tanks but when oil rebounds it’s their accomplishments that created jobs and helps economy. Taking credit where credit isn’t due
2937 2018-01-09 18:49:52 — for the living.

2938 2018-01-09 18:49:42 API Prez Jack Gerard on reporter's question of what happens to oil and gas industry if NAFTA gets blown up: "I wouldn't want to talk about alternatives." I.E., let's not jinx things.
2939 2018-01-09 18:49:40 We're already rich with oil but our Government is corrupt. Even if Nigeria is richer than China with the type of leaders we have, we will still be poor!
2940 2018-01-09 18:49:39 ENOUGH with this bullshit already. Racism is not going to be wiped out tomorrow just because you bully & shame everyone who criticises bloody OPRAH, who does nothing but sell psychological snake oil. You CAN criticise WOC and still not be a racist; not that hard to imagine.
2941 2018-01-09 18:49:37 You're the type to let some guy in a lab jacket scribble a bunch of equations on a board and convince you that Olive Oil is built like Jessica Rabbit. 
2942 2018-01-09 18:49:30 Gas and oil platforms of the gazan coast there stole no doubt
2943 2018-01-09 18:49:11 Grow up: everyone is better off insulating, replacing inefficient appliances, buying more efficient vehicles.

You pay less per km now than any previous time.

Heating with oil is stupid in 2018. Natural gas AND oil are so cheap compared to just a few years ago the tax is little.
2944 2018-01-09 18:49:08 we all just took shots of olive oil
2945 2018-01-09 18:49:06 Sis coconut oil and no heattttttt

2948 2018-01-09 18:48:56 There are several other factors as I see it. They are all weighted differently every trading day based on incomplete information that all market participants get.
2949 2018-01-09 18:48:50 Why would they invest in offshore when shale is lesser cost and producing just fine
2950 2018-01-09 18:48:48 Canada needs to build more pipelines so canadian oil and gas companies can benefit more from the recent surge in prices
2951 2018-01-09 18:48:48 so fun fact I learned how to check my oil today and not go over 4000 miles for my next oil change
2952 2018-01-09 18:48:30 We need to be taken over by oil sheikhs
2953 2018-01-09 18:48:16 But then you never were a journalist Alastair. Just a speech writing toady for snake oil salesmen. And that was when you were a so called political editor.
2954 2018-01-09 18:48:13 Defiantly recommend the Salmon Oil!

2957 2018-01-09 18:47:58 Rumor has it that she is "seriously considering" running in 2020. Let's make #fuckoprah go viral to let her know she should go back to her snake oil sales.
2958 2018-01-09 18:47:50 Yay! At least we’ll be able to monitor the new oil spills.
2959 2018-01-09 18:47:32 Sugar... preferably @BRITISH_SUGAR with cold pressed British Rapeseed Oil! Keep it British #buybritish #exfoliatebritish
2960 2018-01-09 18:47:28 Das Oil soll ranzig werden und stinken, hat man mir gesagt 
2961 2018-01-09 18:47:26 I'm sure these higher prices are incentivizing the $hit out of shale producers to drill more and more.
2962 2018-01-09 18:47:22 I mean I see no difference unless oil and coal industries stop running and trees stop getting cut down so.. Just sounds like a whole lotta politics unless that's actually changed lmao
2963 2018-01-09 18:47:18 Oh come on, with oil prices @ 60$ it won't be happening any time soon, BUT it could happen in the future when we really need it, unless you don't want energy for your PC's, phones, etc.
2964 2018-01-09 18:47:01 Sliiiiiiide some oil on me! @thelazerhorse

2969 2018-01-09 18:46:24 You are only benefitting the wealthiest Americans....BTW will thete be oil rigs off Palm Beach coast?  I didn't think so.
2970 2018-01-09 18:46:22 when America steps out - who steps in?
Russia, China, India, EU, other Middle East powers?
Russia, China, India, Middle East - that's 3/4-ish of World Oil under 1 tent
with USA pushing them together
still think u'r not getting anything?

2973 2018-01-09 18:46:11 The demand rise wasn't much in the report. It's the speculation over China and India growing.
2974 2018-01-09 18:46:07 With lots of fudge (leaked motor oil).
2975 2018-01-09 18:46:00 I asked my barber this morning what the secret was to a full grown beard outside of bbutter/tree oil/eating pussy. He gon tell me "drink more water". Nigga, Im 70% water, what's the secret!?
2976 2018-01-09 18:45:57 Ever noticed how you can make anyone sound evil by prefacing with 'big', regardless your politics? Big oil, big g'vment, big pharma... So why still the culture of perpetual expansion?!
2977 2018-01-09 18:45:54 De todas formas, entiendo que Vaca Muerta es un play de gas más que de oil.
2978 2018-01-09 18:45:49 USD/CAD eases off highs on oil rally, stays above mid-1.24s   #Forex
2979 2018-01-09 18:45:47 Waiting rooms at car dealerships are always weird. Like I wanna ask them "what are ya in for, an oil change?"

And expect 

"Nah, my car caught fire on the highway"
2980 2018-01-09 18:45:46 #kwanza seems the BNA has only done 10%. The rally in oil prices (however long it may last) has probably made them reluctant to do more at this stage.
2981 2018-01-09 18:45:37 Oil me up bayyybeeeeee
2982 2018-01-09 18:45:27 January 9, 1925 - Los Angeles' Royal Giants collected twenty-one hits in a, 20-0 win over Shell Oil at Los Angeles' White Sox park.
2983 2018-01-09 18:45:20 As OPEC hold their agreed production quota's the US oil output is on course to rise to a record high of 11m barrels by the end of 2019. #OPEC @gulf_intel
2984 2018-01-09 18:45:18 I moisturize with coconut oil and leave in conditioner. My hair loves cream of nature products. What have you tested with? Your hair will respond if it doesn’t like it.
2985 2018-01-09 18:45:17 We'd all prefer if you used oil...I mean...I said nothing.
2986 2018-01-09 18:45:16 Just watched a customer casually walk up to pay for his oil change with a bottle of fireball. Give a fuck level 0.
2987 2018-01-09 18:45:13 It certainly is no friend of the oil and gas industry.
2988 2018-01-09 18:45:05 Lucas Moura: not thrilling to be picking up oil team cast offs but JM seems to know what he’s doing in the old transfers.
2989 2018-01-09 18:44:50 When there is no divine order, people miss their miracles. You have the keep the oil flowing to be ready.

2990 2018-01-09 18:44:40 Ugh. It had to be so greasy, with oil slicks up top and bits of crunchy mess floating throughout. I’ll pass.
2991 2018-01-09 18:44:35 Please Mr. President, do remember the Ranchers too, and Farmers!,  save them from the corrupt BLM;  AND PARDON BUNDY/FAMILY! And, save our Wild Mustangs too! And please PROMOTE use of CANNABIS for PAPER PRODUCTS (& food/oil) please! thank you! MAGA!

2995 2018-01-09 18:44:03 .@BillGates  Is the advertisement for “your” hemp oil legitimate? Looks like a scam - is it?
2996 2018-01-09 18:43:57 The way #NXT is going down, I hope it will discover crude oil !!!
2997 2018-01-09 18:43:51 Hey OILMAN!! Bring down the price of oil!
2998 2018-01-09 18:43:45 Still under suspension from Labour Party since last year but they still don’t give a fuck. Still giving jobs to their cronies who were voted out. You’ve got to remember Aberdeen has oil so the high heidies get to ponce about being posh. I bet our lord Provost is worse than your’s
2999 2018-01-09 18:43:44 Not with relaxing standards on what constitutes toxic chemicals, allowing farmers and miners to foul our streams and other waterways. Selling off national lands to oil and mining interests.
3000 2018-01-09 18:43:43 I have read elsewhere that he has an income of almost  £30,000 per 'month' from his Kurdistan based oil business. That's more than the average uk annual wage. How do we have these people in positions of such power.
3001 2018-01-09 18:43:43 Hopefully, the whale oil subsidy will make it through!

3005 2018-01-09 18:43:13 I really feel like I shouldn’t have to deal w/ shit like getting an oil change..
3006 2018-01-09 18:43:04 We r being slashed and cheated badly on gas prices. Spread the word. Folks better wake up. Plenty, plenty of oil.
3007 2018-01-09 18:43:03 The devaluing dollar was the main reason the cartel #petrojamJa justify petrol increase in light of oil price going down. What I'd the excuse now?
3008 2018-01-09 18:43:00 Are you nuts-we have nothing but oil, gas,coal, renewable energy, fishing, food, R&D, people etc etc we don’t need to borrow - you are mistaking us for bankrupt England - the real benefit junkies
3009 2018-01-09 18:42:54 You make it sound as though you intend on eating popcorn while you read. Aren't you worried about getting oil/grease on your e-reader?

3011 2018-01-09 18:42:43 Just wondering why the bunker 20 ult’s oil spill doesnt get ignited with the bunkers flame thrower? It would be nice. Maybe an untalented oil spill perhaps 
3012 2018-01-09 18:42:40 Commodities are topping out here. Likely won't see higher highs this year. I see oil falling to $10, nat gas to $1 & copper to $1. Deflationary downturn coming & will be steep, swift & extremely painful. Precious metals a different story. They should resume rally shortly.
3013 2018-01-09 18:42:38 And for the cauliflower fried rice I literally just dump a bag of frozen riced cauliflower, cook it in sesame oil, add whatever vegetables + protein, add some eggs if that’s your jam and top with soy sauce
3014 2018-01-09 18:42:14 I think the buildup of oil on the freeways over the 360 days of non-rain *does* make them a sort of black ice.
3015 2018-01-09 18:42:12 Lavender essential oil gives too much relieving scent...

3021 2018-01-09 18:41:42 Yes, let's continue to be dependent on the middle east for oil.
3022 2018-01-09 18:41:41 Why does getting an oil change take so long when they say “instant oil change” like dude I’ve been here for over 30 minutes, you’re wrong
3023 2018-01-09 18:41:29 I want dogs.

3025 2018-01-09 18:41:27 Are you receptive to recipes involving a fry pan and oil? (It took me over a year to get over my fear of these two items, that’s why I ask)
3026 2018-01-09 18:41:24 It points it's private parts at olive oil ! It has to mozzarella with basil and dill enfused with balsamic vinegar and lavender oil
3027 2018-01-09 18:41:16 You may not need the oil but America does.  You commies can do without
3028 2018-01-09 18:41:14 I changed my oil, cleaned out my car, and got it washed today bitch I feel like MONEYYYYY
3029 2018-01-09 18:41:06 So quit using your valuable time helping illegal immigrants that compete with our many poorer citizens for jobs and housing and work to stop any further development of oil. California's urban centers are overrun with homeless citizens because of the number of illegal immigrants.

3053 2018-01-09 18:38:56 You are not even a half wit-Scotland has contributed £1.8Tn NPV in oil alone while England is £2 - 6Tn in debt through borrowing/QE against Scottish oil-that’s why they hold on to us you muppet, they are otherwise bankrupt
3054 2018-01-09 18:38:55 Well you can't fix the lack of chemistry easily which basically spells doom for you movie of people just talking to each other.

3055 2018-01-09 18:38:52 People lost trust in #shale being able to take on #OPEC+ plus all the major players stopped investing into offshore past two years. That's how I see it... I am sure they are over reacting to some of it...

3072 2018-01-09 18:36:53 It's been a movement since 72.  Volker not allowing wage prices to keep up with outside supply shock of oil price increases, broke labor.  Should have just allowed the price increase.
3073 2018-01-09 18:36:50 When Gerard uses term energy infrastructure, do you think he means just oil and gas infrastructure? Does he concede that 100% renewable by 2050 would also double benefits of investments, only in solar, wind, hydro?
3074 2018-01-09 18:36:50 their stupidity is giving me a migraine, the crazy comments are posted again today in her new message I'm beside myself I think these comments come also anti-fans of KS not only "fans" ofEXO, because comments throw oil on the fire

3082 2018-01-09 18:36:16 Could opposition to Trump's bold offshore drilling draft plan up & down the US coasts be a contagion that spreads to the oil & gas industry as a whole? 
Smart question from @chrispknight #SOAE2018
3083 2018-01-09 18:36:10 Yes, the effort is because it is a cheap and plentyful source of energy, without it people would die, the benefits far outweigh the risks of using oil.
3084 2018-01-09 18:36:02 Yes! Also, we could try subbing avocado for some of the olive oil  (I’m still hungry, I should fix that)

3113 2018-01-09 18:32:37 We hate that he gave gigantic tax cuts to the people that need them the least.  We hate that he sneers at climate change and appointed an oil lobbyist to head the EPA.  We hate that he’s hell-bent on destroying Obamacare, that provides health coverage for millions of Americans.

3117 2018-01-09 18:32:13 As of 2013, only 12.9% of Americans work in good producing sector of US economy. 

The good producing sector includes agriculture, manufacturing, construction, home building, oil and gas production.

3131 2018-01-09 18:30:47 Petro Oil, Very disappointed in your services. I have been without oil for over 48 hours, freezing in my home. Today is my scheduled delivery day and no oil is yet to be delivered. #petrooil
3132 2018-01-09 18:30:39 I disagree, I believe running a huge deficit has led to the credit downgrades. And why isn't our oil wanted internationally? It's produced with the highest environmental & ethical standards on the planet. Someone is spending a lot of money funding a smear campaign!
3133 2018-01-09 18:30:34 I could give you the entirty of scientific consensus and what difference would it make to you?  If you start out by saying the EPA is lying (which is different than saying the oil shill moron Pruitt is lying), then you've shown you don't care about what is actually true.
3134 2018-01-09 18:30:28 #HealthTip Healthy fats can help lower cholesterol. Consider eating healthy fats such as avocados, coconut oil, extra virgin olive oil and nuts.

You have a very childish and narrow sighted view of reality
3136 2018-01-09 18:30:14 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
3137 2018-01-09 18:30:04 Oh my God Masturbating feels incredible after showering with coconut oil mixed with hot water and applied to your entire naked meat vehicle. I can see why couples use oil during sex. Feels insanely good.
3138 2018-01-09 18:29:55 Hmm. Maybe try essential oil too?

3162 2018-01-09 18:27:10 I use peppermint oil for air freshener and lavender for migraines and blocked sinuses. I use a burner (it’s cheap) but a diffuser is supposed to be better because it uses less and doesn’t burn off some of the good qualities

3175 2018-01-09 18:25:48 Another oil spill with compliments of the fossil fuel industry... ever seen a solar or wind spill from solar and wind energy solutions? #KeepItInTheGround
3176 2018-01-09 18:25:35 The solar industry came from oil and power companies, that justified the losses by the appearance of free energy from the sun... Arco became Siemens, became Shell, became Solar World all in 20 yrs... Now a stand alone Solar Co. can only exist by subsidy...

3179 2018-01-09 18:25:15  I have no desire to see offshore drilling here on my Florida coast - the effects from the BP oil spill were bad enough. Thankfully, there’s generally bipartisan anti-drilling consensus in FL politics - the administration is not going to find much support here for their plan!
3180 2018-01-09 18:25:15 I wrote the Rev a long letter about how the dog knocked the oil packet on the floor and my husband slipped on it and broke 3 backbones, and we didn't have the rent, and got thrown out and he couldn't even walk, and how was any of this a blessing?

3186 2018-01-09 18:24:57 Washington State Board, Vancouver Port Commission both unanimously vote against the largest oil-by-rail terminal in North America!! The process for terminating their lease is started, such a win for everyone in Vancouver and our state.

3190 2018-01-09 18:24:29 I need some coconut oil !!!
3191 2018-01-09 18:24:28 I don't disagree that a study suggested a red flag. My real thoughts are, there were no conclusions drawn that were statistically significant to say "canola oil significantly contributes to Alzheimers." My issue is media hyperbole. IMO, the headlines are grossly out of context.
3192 2018-01-09 18:24:28 All that Oil money and City still can't get enough "fans" to watch tonight's game without offering tickets for free..

3193 2018-01-09 18:24:25 Political oil spill. Who will clean this up?
3194 2018-01-09 18:24:16 I’ve been using oil free acne wash (oil based) then hydrating face wash (water based) and rose water as my face toner and my face has NEVER been clearer
3195 2018-01-09 18:24:10 And they just got rid of regulations concerning safety protocols to ensure oil spills don't happen again...
3196 2018-01-09 18:24:02 thats what happens when you build a club off oil money , no passion, everything is expected.
3197 2018-01-09 18:23:51 Check out the Sky News program, Arctic Peril, showing hundreds of Narwell trying to survive in a tiny air hole in the ice, before drowning, driven there by oil exploration. Equally upsetting.
3198 2018-01-09 18:23:43 Mexico has natural resources.Oil & Gas, Gold & Silver.Yet we give them 43 Billion a yr. Why? Cash Remittances to Mexico is $26B from their citizens here illegally in the USA.

3202 2018-01-09 18:23:34 Coal is going down not because of Obama there’s been a decline since the 70’s and FYI the also call drilling for oil an natural gas mining as well so that 50,000 job gains in mining was only 1,000 for coal mining
3203 2018-01-09 18:23:33 100-plus days of oil buildup on our roads means they are slick during this rainstorm. Drive slowly, leave plenty of space between you and other vehicles and allot extra time to get to your destination. #zerofatalities
3204 2018-01-09 18:23:30 I hate doing anything car related. Oil changes, changing tires etc. only time I ever want a man.

3210 2018-01-09 18:23:10 It’s great with roast chicken or meats paste it down and mix with oil and use as a rub. Use to make dressings, sauté potato’s, put in stews, soups. It’s endless. Many uses for the creative home cooks & chefs
3211 2018-01-09 18:23:04  I cook them in the sauce, Mexican style... so nice how they turn so flavoursome and no oil involved.
3212 2018-01-09 18:23:00 Excellent suggestion, to that I’ll add eat pesto as a delivery system for garlic, lots of garlic. Or try eating a clove of garlic dipped in olive oil and rolled in grated Parmesan cheese, washed down by a slug of Green Flash West Coast IPA...
3213 2018-01-09 18:23:00 I was so fascinated by the swag, I sent him just enough to keep it coming. There was a little packet of holy oil, you were supposed to dab some on your forehead and dab some on a $20 bill, sleep with it under your pillow, then send the $20 to Rev Ewing in the morning. However...

3217 2018-01-09 18:22:35 Just a news snippet repeat. But me personally? All I see are price increases to be honest (bar the occasional special offers). Actually Oil companies buy when cheap, store it in off shore tankers and sell when the price is high - or so I have been told. But then, what do I know.
3218 2018-01-09 18:22:35 Damn I gotta go buy some more Moroccan oil for my hair and another concealer. I lost all that shit being drunk on Saturday

3225 2018-01-09 18:22:01 Yeah, 15k total. She’ll be getting her state inspections in May — make her big check up a once a year thing. She’s due for an oil and filter anyway. Might as well throw in the tire rotation.
3226 2018-01-09 18:22:01 Our industry is a world leader in producing and refining oil and #natgas. To continue our success in 2018 we need to demand smart, safe and pro-energy policies.
3227 2018-01-09 18:21:58 Why would the market NOT be up when profits are coming back to Oil related names? And earnings for large caps rising? why try and short that?
3228 2018-01-09 18:21:55 Is that before or after he approves oil drilling in the same area

3233 2018-01-09 18:21:31 But you'll happily burn the gas from the oil produced in the Gulf of Mexico. While you're figuring that out, how about send us our money to restore the coastline destroyed by the oil and gas industry?
3234 2018-01-09 18:21:30 I have an unending fear that I will be getting some sort of service (getting my oil changed) and my debit card won't work, and have no cash

The USDCAD has moved higher in trading today. The rally (lower CAD) runs counter to the price of oil which is up 1.77% today. It tends to support…

3255 2018-01-09 18:19:31 Is the 15k miles total miles or how long it's been since your last change? Either way, sounds like oil and filter is a good idea. Rotating tires is also a good idea. The inspections stuff? Ehh. You get your car inspected each year for the state anyways, right?

3265 2018-01-09 18:18:08 Absolutely! We are crammed with amazing shows this 2018! To list a few: @dmgenergy, @IPC_Calgary , Roseland Oil&Gas, Industry Connect!

3268 2018-01-09 18:18:05 The poisoning our water myth.  You do understand that there is a thing called oil seepage?  It's been going on for millions of years.  Our water system does filter this out.
3269 2018-01-09 18:17:40 They can work well if you just put a little oil before you wipe. Loosens stuff up.
3270 2018-01-09 18:17:38 I'm burning through oil fast, and my electric bill doubles in Winter.  We got caught up in that bomb hurricane.
3271 2018-01-09 18:17:33 Coconut oil
3272 2018-01-09 18:17:28 Oil prices edged higher, touching its highest since May 2015, supported by OPEC-led production cuts and expectations that U.S. crude inventories have dropped for an eighth week.
3273 2018-01-09 18:17:16 Thanks! It was a packaged beer cheese mac and cheese haha. I mixed olive oil, panko, a little salt, cheese, and crumbled turkey bacon, put it on top of already cooked mac n cheese, and broiled til golden brown
3274 2018-01-09 18:17:07 Malaysian Plantations Minister forecast the country's 2018 palm oil production will rise to more than 20 mmt, compared to 2017's 19.5 mmt.
3275 2018-01-09 18:16:53 So they give me an option of just an oil/filter change (Option A) or all this other stuff too (Option B). I love Jane Honda and want to make sure I make the right choice for her. ~15k miles. What do you think?
3276 2018-01-09 18:16:52 I meant sell the oil back to you for 4x profit after they receive a tax break for poisoning our water. 

And my point is if there are vacant homes and millions of homeless the system isnt working for everyone.
3277 2018-01-09 18:16:44 I've attempted to take your advice, but no one would wager against my ass per your suggestion.

Perception is reality ... crude oil inventories (both #OCED and #Cushing) and #OPEC's view of the importance of eliminating > 5-yr avg overhang driving the bus . . . for now.

Long-term predictions see oil reaching around $75 per barrel.

3290 2018-01-09 18:15:33 Uhhh, oil companies drill for oil. They don't drill for water nor sell it to us for 4 times whatever the cost is. You want to put homeless people in vacant properties that likely aren't livable? Who will manage the property then? The property owners at their expense?

3293 2018-01-09 18:15:08 But higher WTI means more crude oil production and thus more associated NG production, as well, which should be bearish for NG. No?
3294 2018-01-09 18:15:05 If your tooth hurts while you're waiting for ring to go to the dentist or til you get your refund, get some clove oil and put a few drops on the sore tooth. Numbs it up good.

3302 2018-01-09 18:14:00 Oil and filter go hand in hand when you get your oil changed, and when it's the dealer doing it they'll go and inspect all that stuff because that's what they do.
3303 2018-01-09 18:13:51 With the right controls against spillage and severe fines against companies when spillage occurs, it makes sense to be energy independent instead of buying oil from countries who hate us.  Also, it will help keep prices low.

3337 2018-01-09 18:11:03 EUR/USD is falling further, now at 1.19200. CRUDE OIL is rising again, it is close to 63.00 USD per barrel. GOLD has lost some points and landed at 1,311 USD.
3338 2018-01-09 18:11:01 But I don't mind if some corporations receive "socialist" benefits. But that same kind of consideration should be given to citizens, too. Right now be biggest beneficiaries of such things is corporations. Even ones that don't need it. Like the oil industry that makes so much.
3339 2018-01-09 18:10:55 I think the loons are getting a hard on on the demand estimate of the EIA. That's if I'm reading it correctly.

3348 2018-01-09 18:09:49 My gynecologist suggested placing warm castor oil on my lower stomach for like a hour everyday while i wasn’t on my period & doing forward bending exercises during my period that definitely helped for cramps too

3350 2018-01-09 18:09:45 But where are the fundamentals that support this?
Trading oil on technicals only makes no damn sense, and I think you all know this - but what the hell. Play it like the video-game it has become.

3353 2018-01-09 18:09:14 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.

3358 2018-01-09 18:08:57 You’ve been crying for years, ‘the NDP doesn’t control commodity prices’. Now that oil is up you want a pat on the back?

How about some details on these jobs?
3359 2018-01-09 18:08:33 Lol I'm Romanian olive oil is a constant regardless
3360 2018-01-09 18:08:28 not only expanding drilling but destroying regulations to insure safe drilling at the same time, also did away with tax that went to clean ups of oil spills #trifectaofstupidity

3364 2018-01-09 18:08:16 Just saw "pink bubblegum beard oil", designed by someone who has never observed an interaction between bubble gum and beards
3365 2018-01-09 18:08:15 HPCL, IOC, BPCl problems only starting. Once oil crosses 70 they will find it difficult to increase prices
3366 2018-01-09 18:08:06 To work or not to work in the Minnesota oil fields? 
3367 2018-01-09 18:08:01 It’s also hard to predict stupid and this rally is pure stupidity with no fundamental or technical reasoning. But even stupidity needs to end at some point. Hopefully soon. Will be nice for oil to get back to reality

3374 2018-01-09 18:07:09 Spoiler alert: When you're all finished it will read "Dolly Parton" upside down. Can I get at least a chuckle for "Shell Oil"? ;o)
3375 2018-01-09 18:07:02 I mean that article is pretty accurate. She's  been peddling snake oil from  charlatans her whole career. Not sure I want that as president. How about Dwayne Johnson? 
3376 2018-01-09 18:06:53 Rather than buy oil from countries that hate us, we should be energy independent.  We need to impose mandatory cleanup and huge fines against any spills, but not prevent drilling.
3377 2018-01-09 18:06:46 البته اين اغراق شدس ، oilش انقدر نيس

3380 2018-01-09 18:06:31 So I got an essential oil diffuser for Christmas and I just need to ask...why does everyone suddenly like them so much? What do they do?
3381 2018-01-09 18:06:24 かっ、カッコいいー！！
3382 2018-01-09 18:06:20 Literally have to pay damn near 200 for the oil change in the Beamer
3383 2018-01-09 18:06:19 U.S. oil rose to $62.68 a barrel. Brent crude is at $68.57 per barrel. Can these high crude prices be sustained? If so, this is great news for US shale oil producers. They survived the OPEC/Russia price war. In fact they won! With oil above $ 60 most of them are profitable!
3384 2018-01-09 18:06:17 Crude oil now flirting with levels dangerous for India. Need to watch if this one develops into a worry for the market in terms of higher inflation and interest rates.
3385 2018-01-09 18:06:08 What part is confusing? The part where oil companies poison our water, get a tax break, and sell it back to you for 4x? The part where more homes sit vacant than the # of ppl sleeping on the street?
3386 2018-01-09 18:05:59 My furnace is literally so loud but at least it’s running cause I have like. No oil
3387 2018-01-09 18:05:43 what determines the virginity of an oil?
3388 2018-01-09 18:05:42 Depressed for sure when you can't get "friends" & Family to listen, they take the word of Politicians that are bought off by Oil, Gas, & Coal interest, I try to tell them, these Science deniers are from the think tanks that told us Cigarettes didn't cause cancer. Great Work!

3392 2018-01-09 18:05:30 It's harder to short than it is to go long. It matters not. We wait. By December we will be singing a different tune. US oil production may very well alead be at 10 million.

3397 2018-01-09 18:04:58 All this #ScotchPie talk gives me an idea to make a bespoke #HotWaterPastry using @ORODEALPREMIUM infused with Cardamom & Turmeric.
3398 2018-01-09 18:04:55 Oil seeps naturally into waters off Santa Barbara.  Oil drilling relieves the natural oil pressure which results in less natural seepage.  Need to impose severe fines for spillage caused by oil companies.  Rather than buy oil from countries that hate us, we should drill here.
3399 2018-01-09 18:04:54  Same as in Oil, only the opposite direction.
3400 2018-01-09 18:04:48 If it weren't for those drill rigs, the shores of Southern California would be covered in thick gooey oil from natural seeps.
3401 2018-01-09 18:04:45 Yeah I just started using oil based makeup remover and mascara, they didn’t look that bad and the makeup remover helped most of them fall off.
3402 2018-01-09 18:04:44 This is actually good news for US oil producers and workers. They need a minimum profitable price to keep operating. There is a cost to US oil independence. Small price to pay to get out from under Saudi Arabian dominance.
3403 2018-01-09 18:04:40 $USO #oil strong again.. small energy names like $CEI $ENRJ could offer big upside once volume comes in.
3404 2018-01-09 18:04:37 I still look at PDVSA bonds as much more riskier than government ones on the basis that the oil belongs to the state of vzla not to PDVSA. In an extreme scenario they could revoke the permission to extract oil to pdvsa and leave creditors with nothing.
3405 2018-01-09 18:04:35 So you’re saying this is more of an ...inessential oil scheme?
3406 2018-01-09 18:04:34 Strong Oil = jobs                                                       Strong Oil = government revenue

3422 2018-01-09 18:02:57 When the spill comes...and it will...there will be no money for the cleanup because the GOP shut down the fee their oil buddies pay for cleanup.  It will be on the backs of the middle class tax payers.

3452 2018-01-09 17:59:25 I may be deviating from technicals but somehow I can't imagine a scenario of markets benefiting from pre-election full budget and trajectory of Fed's rate hikes. Don't know till when can INR resist crude oil rise too. My bias: negative but will test markets through probes for now
3453 2018-01-09 17:59:20 Must've spilled cooking oil on her burkha.

3455 2018-01-09 17:59:13 Hoy el OIL alcanza los 63 Usd/Barril en la referencia WTI y 69 Usd/Barril el Brent.  Pero claro, muchos vendieron sus acciones porque el Oil iba para 30, 20 o 10 usd/Barril. 

Es el costo de la ignorancia la que lleva a cometer grandes errores al no tener argumentos PROPIOS !
3456 2018-01-09 17:59:12 Oil and coal is the way right now to power our country. The renewals are very poor at making enough energy. Sure pollution but you want to bankrupt the country
3457 2018-01-09 17:59:02 Fortune is smiling on Nigeria very early in the year: Crude oil prices are heading skywards, foreign reserves is looking northward, stock market is soaring higher.
3458 2018-01-09 17:58:46 Don't think it will be long until an oil rich tycoon comes in and changes the game. Pooh sticks championships in Russia and Qatar...its gonna be like 45 degrees don't you know!
3459 2018-01-09 17:58:42 They just want £££ instead of promoting renewables, anyone would think they're on the pockets of the oil companies
3460 2018-01-09 17:58:36 What about hemp oil that is banned? Probably a handful of people claiming to cure but this will impact us all ! Backward country.
3461 2018-01-09 17:58:25 Lush massage bar or Bath and Body Works massage oil? 
3462 2018-01-09 17:58:22 Olive oil make Kirie hair grow. Not the olive oil adults use..the real cooking olive oil lol
3463 2018-01-09 17:58:18 I am literally using so many Tea Tree Oil products, so WHY am I still breaking out?! Isn’t Tea Tree Oil supposed to be the cure all oil!?
3464 2018-01-09 17:58:13 True. To me though olive oil is arbequina, full stop. ;)
3465 2018-01-09 17:58:07 What if the shale oil with its API grade above 45 (for half of new production) makes it less desirable abroad? I am not sure that all eggs are equal in these baskets!
3466 2018-01-09 17:57:58 Yes- home. Barcelona is so much fun. I just wish the exchange was better. Transit  is so easy there. On Jan 1 when everything was closed (surprise), I just rode buses and metro and trams. $10 a day for a pass. The mercats were fantastic - brought home olives/oil, dried fruit etc
3467 2018-01-09 17:57:43 #Eugenol is for numbing your pain. It is the main essential oil component in Clove oil used in perfumery, industrial fragrance and  dentistry
3468 2018-01-09 17:57:42 Next caller: Rachel Notley controls the world price of oil and is in the Illuminati!
3469 2018-01-09 17:57:42 Forget all that “I’m giving you the same energy you give me” talk. I’m just going to simply stop messing with you if my energy doesn’t match your’s in our friendship. You never see water change it’s polarity to mix with oil so why should I?
3470 2018-01-09 17:57:36 I need a full body massage with some eucalyptus oil while lemongrass diffuses in the background. This cold kicking my ass 
3471 2018-01-09 17:57:24 Let's hope we just touched a ceiling.
3472 2018-01-09 17:57:15 @NBCNews i have a sample of components producing oil with the same scent resonance as petroleum. Since Im a witch and a guru I trust ny nose. I need someone named Matt C. PJMC TOD SG. To come and pick me up at SeaTac self storage in Tukwila with my ziploc container of the sample
3473 2018-01-09 17:57:15 Glad to see that chefs are using them! Here in Greece they are an important part of the cuisine, lightly boiled and drizzled with olive oil and a few drops of lemon.
3474 2018-01-09 17:57:12 haha, funny speculation means we are running out of US oil. what the the hell oil consumers are doing..
3475 2018-01-09 17:57:07 I'll post a photo & recipe when it's cooled down.
3476 2018-01-09 17:57:02 Wait until Trump’s friends start oil drilling right off your beaches .

3482 2018-01-09 17:56:40 How much is the oil?
3483 2018-01-09 17:56:33 In desperation I put some olive oil on my chapped and craterous lips and now I have the lip shine of the century. FANCY.
3484 2018-01-09 17:56:33 どんなアイコン？
3485 2018-01-09 17:56:32 It all started when I didn't have any oil in my truck when we were deer hunting
3486 2018-01-09 17:56:25 Agree one hundred percent. We do not want oil drilling on our beautiful coast! Ever!
3487 2018-01-09 17:56:22 my brother getting my oil changed for me HES THE BEST
3488 2018-01-09 17:56:19 My early impression of her was that she, Sally Jessy, Morton Downey, etc. were basically exploiters. She went positive, but still attracted Dr. Phil, Oz, The Secret people, Deepak and other snake oil salesmen. I want Merit and qualifications!
3489 2018-01-09 17:56:16 わたしも真似して手でハート作ったらゲロ吐くくらいキモかった
3490 2018-01-09 17:56:13 Israel wants to control oil?  Well then out of the entire f*ing middle east, why the f*** did we insist on our national homeland and not ... Say... Iraq?
3491 2018-01-09 17:56:06 It's brown sugar, honey, & lemon juice. Tea tree oil is optional
3492 2018-01-09 17:55:53 Well, that happened a lot quicker than I thought it would. Who knew Olive Oil could move from one bottle to the next that quickly? The spill in the kitchen is cleaned up now.#BlindyProblems
3493 2018-01-09 17:55:53 This commercial is brought to you by oil and gas lobbyists.
3494 2018-01-09 17:55:50 Restarting the oil short position at 62.78, after being stopped at 62.50. I'll get this right eventually. No stops yet. #WTI #OOTT
3495 2018-01-09 17:55:46 Gerard from @API_News: We are building a better future and #natgas and oil are essential to our continued progress.  #SOAE2018
3496 2018-01-09 17:55:36 Booze and porn and, while I'm at it, my hash oil pen and an unopened box of Girl Scout Thin Mints are all waiting for me when I get back, don't you worry.
3497 2018-01-09 17:55:30 Ha...great snowdrifts here!! All good! Time is SWOOSHING by though!!  SOO excited! Getting my FURNACE today!!  It'll only take TWO tanks of oil to heat this barracks up again!!  WOOT WOOT
3498 2018-01-09 17:55:30 Exactly. Without Stammer. If Oil were in the thick of the race without McDavid, then ya, definitely a comparable.
3499 2018-01-09 17:55:29 i’ve always wondered how the virginity of an olive affects its quality as an oil
3500 2018-01-09 17:55:28 Amid political slugfest over construction of a refinery at Barmer in Rajasthan, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Tuesday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi will do “project commencement” work on the Rs 43,129 crore project on January 16.
3501 2018-01-09 17:55:23 My take on today's #EIA #STEO report for #oil bears is, beatings will continue until morale improves.  Still considering your shorter short position?
3502 2018-01-09 17:55:02 In the oven at 80 for 3 million years and it turns into oil.
3503 2018-01-09 17:54:59 I’m sure you’ll get a different description from a wine connoisseur but they may not be as familiar with olive oil as I am 
3504 2018-01-09 17:54:47 The larger degree is for a (C) wave a lot higher. Been bullish #oil, $XLE & $XOP for a LONG time. Was pounding the table on the latter two in July/Aug. ONE small degree short setup inside a possible start to this 2 in $CL invalidated.
3505 2018-01-09 17:54:39 Oil money.
3506 2018-01-09 17:54:34 Oil n filter change got my baby running like a horse..
3507 2018-01-09 17:54:14 The volume seems decent, 550k. How much more buying can go on, everyone and their mama has bought oil now, MMs are in, how much more can they push this higher?
3508 2018-01-09 17:54:13 Where do I find this?! Cause my daughters hair is so curly and tangled oil doesn’t even help!
3509 2018-01-09 17:54:05 1.9 job opportunities are expected in oil & natural by 2035. 40% will be filled by African Americans & Hispanics.  #SOAE2018
3510 2018-01-09 17:54:01 CBD Oil... Completely took away anxiety...  It’s a natural miracle!
3511 2018-01-09 17:53:54 .@API_News' Jack Gerard is now talking about the makeup of the oil and gas workforce #SOAE2018
3512 2018-01-09 17:53:50 Laviolette points out shots were 29-4 EDM when NSH scored its first goal in what turned out to be Preds’ 10th straight win over Oil. 

Sekera in for Davidson; Caggiula replaces Auvitu on 4th line. Talbot vs Rinne in net.
3513 2018-01-09 17:53:48 Now hold up, that tea tree oil can be useful. But yeah the rest is garbage
3514 2018-01-09 17:53:35 Marathon Oil station on 221N the site of monitoring wells.  Must have been a leaky oil tank in their past somewhere.
3515 2018-01-09 17:53:27 I've just finished my bottle and used it in a banana & lemon bread using half oil to butter, gives a great nutty flavour.
3516 2018-01-09 17:53:27 #RussianMade @realDonaldTrump Eliminated Regulatory Controls covering Oil - Rig Blowouts simultaneously attempting to open our western and eastern seaboards, from Washington to The Baja, and from Maine to The Keys, to "OFFSHORE DRILLING"! Coastal States AG's Must Sue!
3517 2018-01-09 17:53:24 Hay rex dont u feel there is a ton of prices fixing  going on in the oil patch.. especially with oil imports coming into the United States
3518 2018-01-09 17:53:24 How much oil do we have under there in your opinion? Do you think ukog could become a Big / decent sized oil company within the next five years?
3519 2018-01-09 17:53:23 “In addition to structural issues, MENA weathered several shocks this past decade: financial crisis, Arab Spring, and fall in oil prices. Now, more than ever, we need to work on fiscal space in the region.” - Jihad Azour at @IMFNews paper launch at @CarnegieEndow

3522 2018-01-09 17:52:58 Vile that the costal elites have made a mockery of eating tide pods which I assume many southern Americans must consume in the Oil Fields
3523 2018-01-09 17:52:58 oil nice uptick, the problem I see for new longs where is the exit? $dwt $uwt
3524 2018-01-09 17:52:56 I’ve tried to understand why we would deport El Salvadoran refugees or drill for oil in the oceans, tried to be emphathetic to those that want these things. I simply disagree, wholly. I picked a side on these issues.
3525 2018-01-09 17:52:47 Well to my point, life is about understanding these things, living life in Balance.  I know that cannibis oil has cured people of cancer and I don't see the same with alcohol so for us it's about balance and moderation and education when it comes to wine and for plants too
3526 2018-01-09 17:52:47 Except the FBI.  Screw those guys and the scores of agents who gave their lives as the last measure of their duty.  Side talking jack hole - smarmy snake oil con man -
3527 2018-01-09 17:52:42 Is it short squeezing? Or are lunatics buying?

3531 2018-01-09 17:51:59 Nyet, nyet: the Saudis have oil and money and hence are GOOD MUSLIMS, nyet terrorists. Everyone know that terrorists come from BAD MUSLIM places like Iran and North Korea and Cuba- NYET SAUDI. Besides.. the ORB...
3532 2018-01-09 17:51:55 I would think the fat needs to be solid, not liquid oil.
3533 2018-01-09 17:51:52 Grapeseed oil?
3534 2018-01-09 17:51:49 $SDRL if the restructuring plan wouldn’t be that dramatic for retail shareholders, I would invest into this one due to the rising oil price
3535 2018-01-09 17:51:48 Gerard: America is leading the world in the development and refining of natural gas and oil. Our industry is not just creating jobs, we're keeping energy prices affordable and enhancing our energy security. #SOAE2018

3537 2018-01-09 17:51:33 When I saw last night $CL_F had finally taken out the high it made LAST WEEK, I knew we were in for round 2 on the indices. Once again, have to watch for oil to cave.
3538 2018-01-09 17:51:29 Or crude oil
3539 2018-01-09 17:51:22 Have you checked out the science?  Offshore oil drilling in Santa Barbara Channel reduces the natual oil seeps that every UCSB student knows about. Do you want 100k barrels of oil a year in the ocean or would you rather get it out and stop the damage?

3544 2018-01-09 17:50:49 For an intense marching/battle scene (if there is one in your novel) I use the 'Oil of Empires' theme from Battlefield 1.
3545 2018-01-09 17:50:49 Having survived surgery, I want to give you a tip to live your life to its fullest: Don’t eat microwave bagged popcorn - get some kernels, get some oil, some salt and butter, heat them sumbitches and be happy.
3546 2018-01-09 17:50:30 EIA: U.S. oil output to rise to 10.85 mln bpd in 2019#Forex
3547 2018-01-09 17:50:26 They are delutional, half of shale oil has an API above 45 while the best acres are being used! In 2019, the total new oil projects (conventional) is not exceeding 1.5 million bar. when we face a depletion rate above 5 million/day!
3548 2018-01-09 17:50:26 Wow! Well done. I am not a morning person at all. I’d much rather burn the midnight oil.
3549 2018-01-09 17:50:13 I'll take your silence as yes, you were wrong. And you didn't understand some basic facts about the situation. I hope you take the time to do some reading to understand the situation better! Good luck!

3551 2018-01-09 17:50:07 Well Deborah says Oprah is a formidable  Warrior for Trump to come up against,  and if not her someone , someone is counting their chickens now and thinking , Can I beat Trump , so Don't rest on your laurels,  Please keep the Midnight Oil Burning , and plenty of oil on hand!!!
3552 2018-01-09 17:50:04 He should start by apologizing to his daughter, I’m sure she’s on cloud nine right about now PS.... I work as a blue collar laborer in the oil field, And I’m proud to say today I bought my 10,000th coin. I believe in ripple and I believe in Mr. Garlinghouse

3563 2018-01-09 17:48:23 Bruh she just reminded me I need to her this damn coconut oil, it’s been like a month man
3564 2018-01-09 17:48:20 Not “pothead” related. No “high,” nothing. Medical grade part of hemp oil. Extraordinary for nerve pain. My pharmacy recommended it.
3565 2018-01-09 17:48:20 Sorry, but rapeseed oil is terrible for you. You should read toxic oils by @gillespi
3566 2018-01-09 17:48:19 Figures that once the administration removed the tax for oil spill cleanup, that the #Sanchi would start burning and spewing fumes and oil into the sea on a scale 3x larger than Exxon Valdez. It will eventually earn the title of worst environmental disaster ever. Great plan guys.
3567 2018-01-09 17:48:18 Hope it doesn't leave little oil patches everywhere while being house trained.
3568 2018-01-09 17:48:07 Must be a slow say at the office for the Russian oil puppet 
3569 2018-01-09 17:47:51 I would argue both nations should be doing the 21st century stuff, and countries in the bottom third of the list of developed countries should be doing more of the mining, logging, and drilling for oil (which already happens a lot).
3570 2018-01-09 17:47:39 If you understand that, what China is doing w CNY gold settlement vis a vis oil & other commodities should become starkly apparent.
3571 2018-01-09 17:47:32 Publishe the minimum wages  of every  country & their  petrol prices, start  with  the countries that has oil please!!

3577 2018-01-09 17:46:52 What percentage of our imports is oil? Would like to know
3578 2018-01-09 17:46:46 Now, if each of you had an oil well as your primary source of income, knowing that this is happening, what % of your savings would you keep in either USD's or UST's (so the SNB can effectively steal your oil wealth over time thru money printing)?
3579 2018-01-09 17:46:42 And what are you doing to prevent unsafe drilling off the coast of Oregon? Your party eliminated the safety rules for drilling, is eliminating the safety fund for the eventual cleanup of sites where there will be spills in the 47 new sites you are selling off to big oil donors.
3580 2018-01-09 17:46:42 Why then at 12:42 pm, you are posting Oil at $62.77 a Barrel ?
3581 2018-01-09 17:46:38 Shameless greed and a history of defaulting on loans, cooking the books, deliberate fraud, should disqualify a candidate absolutely. Trump is a good con man. No moral compass. Voters drank the kool-aid AND the snake oil.
3582 2018-01-09 17:46:34 Lol trying to focus the mugs in Oil now since UD2 has flopped?
3583 2018-01-09 17:46:32 Oil and #natgas help the U.S. power past the world's greatest challenges. #SOAE2018 @API_News
3584 2018-01-09 17:46:25 Even if there's no oil there, we should set up a gofundme to place the ugliest rig imaginable as close as possible.
3585 2018-01-09 17:46:24 Btwn PSG ,City and Chelsea.  Chelsea are the ones moving in the right direction. These clubs were all bought by oil billionaires but Chelsea are the big boys out of the 3,they have already won UEFA under Roman their 1st in history

3590 2018-01-09 17:45:48 You’ve got to keep it hydrated - if u have a baby leave in conditioner or even coconut oil. My little ones are mixed (Latin and African American) and since a super young age that was the best thing - it’s a daily thing and a lot of work!
3591 2018-01-09 17:45:39 The algos are getting a hard on from world growth.
3592 2018-01-09 17:45:38 remember weeks ago when the nuances of line up changes was interesting cause we thought Oil still had a shot & that minor adjustments might unlock key?
3593 2018-01-09 17:45:23 It’s a blackhead. Just hardened oil and pus. Although that was on his chest, it can appear on your face as well. That’s why it’s best to get proper facials extractions (when needed) every two weeks. And to use at-home skin care fit for your skin type.
3594 2018-01-09 17:45:20 #QuickFacts Price of oil ended 2017 at $60.12 a barrel, up 12% (and $6.40 a barrel) from its 2016 close of $53.72.  The $60.12 price was the first daily close above $60 a barrel since 6/24/15. #HensslerFinancial

3598 2018-01-09 17:45:04 I use neutrageno face wash and acid free toner and illuminating moistourizor and when I get back to college some fucking ROSE OIL
3599 2018-01-09 17:44:59 The risks are miniscule. Any environmental damage is totally reversible. And, until you give up all your cars, we DO need the oil. Only parasites slough off the work and risks to other parts of the world, of producing the oil they need. Why fund despots who sell us oil? Buy US !
3600 2018-01-09 17:44:50 What do we stand to enjoy as Nigerians if not our common wealth  oil and it's derivatives. Other countries have social amenities we don't. I think that's the least our government can offer its citizens by making it cheap and available.
3601 2018-01-09 17:44:47 They are lunatics. There seems to be money that usually does not trade oil coming in. US oil production may very well be less than a month away from 10 million. That's bearish.
3602 2018-01-09 17:44:45 Hornet Man brewed coffee from the blood of Oil Man ???? yeah.
3603 2018-01-09 17:44:38 I just stress ate an entire plate of pad thai and scallion pancakes and honestly I can feel the oil pulsing through my veins am I dying

3612 2018-01-09 17:43:42 Oil, oil, oil.   Didn't work in Iraq. Won't work in Iran.
3613 2018-01-09 17:43:38 @TAMUVMTH I've seen a few articles saying that essential oil diffusers can be toxic for cats depending on the type of oil in them (e.g. they state eucalyptus is especially dangerous.) Do you have any input on this or scholarly/credible sources to point me to? Thanks!

3616 2018-01-09 17:43:31 y es que hoy no tiene tendencia al alza? que periodo de tiempo miran?!!! recuerde que esto es una cosa cíclica, estacional; o es que estan esperando que rompa 130 para decir que el oil ya no esta en lateral?
3617 2018-01-09 17:43:28 We're stepped out upon the drive thru now, now, with the fate of human hunger in our hands. Fryer oil's been spilled to afford us this moment! Now! Now! Now!
3618 2018-01-09 17:43:19 Hemp heals the soil it's grown in. The science is proven on hemp, plenty of history too. Argument is political. Promote oil, which can make virtually everything we use not from metals, including pharmaceuticals and plastics; or do same thing farming hemp. But TPTB fight hemp.

3622 2018-01-09 17:43:02 Meanwhile the GOP denies that fact. Rampant offshore and on land oil and gas. Climate deniers everywhere including @SenCoryGardner though he is too cowardly to publicly admit it. Hopefully the tipping point has not been reached. What's it going take? Our children will pay.
3623 2018-01-09 17:43:02 Coconut oil unrefined, and I always like adding some essential oils 
3624 2018-01-09 17:42:45 I randomly think about that one time when I lived by myself and I tried grabbing canola oil from the top shelf. The cap was unscrewed and I knocked the whole bottle all over myself and on my floor. I had to just stand there for a minute to process what to do.
3625 2018-01-09 17:42:39 Clearly something is going on with mother earth but our genius of a president wants to build more oil rigs and burn more coal? #cleanenergy
3626 2018-01-09 17:42:37 Anyone else get depressed when they see a busy clogged freeway??? All the toxins coming out those tailpipes, climate change, support of oil economy thriving, people trapped in boxes...

3630 2018-01-09 17:42:30 US should strive for North American Oil Self Sufficiency and render the Middle East of no strategic significance to the US economy. We don't need Arab oil pull out our troops and aid NOW!
3631 2018-01-09 17:42:27 Oil prices edged higher on Tuesday, with U.S. crude touching its highest since December 2014, supported by OPEC-led production cuts and expectations that U.S. crude inventories have dropped for the eighth week.

3632 2018-01-09 17:42:27 Maybe a pipeline would have been safer? The US built more pipelines last year than at any point in the last 40 years. And this was US oil. 
Enbridge and TransCanada have diversified heavily into the US because   Canada is hopeless & our governments do not care about energy jobs.
3633 2018-01-09 17:42:26 @GOP would argue that creating jobs in the healthcare sector only perpetuates the sick and poor draining govt resources that should be used to support coal, nuclear, oil and other donor owned industries.

3640 2018-01-09 17:41:33 EIA has released its first forecasts for oil production in 2019. Expects US to average 10.8 million bpd for that year and surpass 11 million bpd in November 2019. #oil #OOTT #oilandgas

3643 2018-01-09 17:41:24 @TTLastSpring Just a technicality, but are you actually using glue gesso on canvas? Traditional gesso creates a hard inflexible surface and isn't recommended for canvas, but for use only with a rigid support. Canvas is generally sized with glue then primed with white lead in oil
3644 2018-01-09 17:41:20 She has openly peddled woo on her show, magazine and was a regular on Dr. Oz. It’s one thing to call out Trump on his woo but it doesn’t excuse the snake oil she sells

3646 2018-01-09 17:40:41 My car had NO oil in it. Like my baby was so dry  I had to run to this oil change
3647 2018-01-09 17:40:37 How bad would it be if I ordered delivery to the Honda dealership while I wait for my car to get an oil change?

3650 2018-01-09 17:39:59 Why is Venezuela bankrupt within 15 years and yet this country has the worlds highest oil reserves, in fact they very little gasoline, no food, the list continues, but the favorite thing Socialists will tell you is their socialism is better than another countries socialism, 
3651 2018-01-09 17:39:56 Support US oil industry to increase production and keep prices low, constraining Saudi Arabia.
3652 2018-01-09 17:39:56 Are they going to monitor drilling for oil?  Well if there were no drilling there would be no need for monitoring? 
3653 2018-01-09 17:39:48 Oh my god thank you for sharing. I sometimes burn a eucalyptus oil candle from bath and body works... throwing it out now.
3654 2018-01-09 17:39:44 I got plans for today but im waiting for the oil company
They never gave me a window
3655 2018-01-09 17:39:36 Norway banked 49 billion since the oil price fall, the UK paid 139 million to oil companies well done UK governmental policy!!!
3656 2018-01-09 17:39:35 13 people sign up to speak at today's port meeting. Get ready for tons of talk about clean energy,  green jobs,  Orange's victory means no oil terminal, save the earth,  etc. #vanwa

3659 2018-01-09 17:39:01 That olive oil is by far the best I’ve ever had 
3660 2018-01-09 17:38:51 So was killing funding to the Oil Spill Cleanup Fund!!. And there's a 3 million gallon tanker burning right now.
3661 2018-01-09 17:38:44 i accidentally licked off the tea tree oil on my chin breakout and now my tongue is stinging
3662 2018-01-09 17:38:41 It’s more telling how the African American community has been neglected and ignored by liberals for decades but still blindly votes for them as is something will change with the next snake oil salesmen in line.45 is far from perfect but at least he is trying.44 was a false profit
3663 2018-01-09 17:38:40 Never dip the dipstick in company oil. :)
3664 2018-01-09 17:38:39 I really really had a hard time w/the mother in the book who made the decision to keep her family in squalor while never touching the OIL ASSETS she had banked away.
3665 2018-01-09 17:38:25 @3rdTierFan do you think there is going to be any moves for the oil kings??
3666 2018-01-09 17:38:18 Just fuck Westfield, Hutton, oil field, hazel del, and a few others I'm sure I'm missing
3667 2018-01-09 17:38:08 End of December, 2017 China was accused of secretly selling oil to NK. They all have their own agenda.
3668 2018-01-09 17:38:01 I lathered myself in coconut oil and I must say it’s the best decision I’ve ever made
3669 2018-01-09 17:38:01 Never said it would said the gdp per capita is currently higher!
Although Norway does have a 1.3 trillion sovereign oil fund the UK has a huge deficit, draw your own conclusion!
Scotland would also not be paying to refit trident! Or House it safely somewhere for England to decide
3670 2018-01-09 17:38:00 Rubbing coconut oil on my nails daily has made them grow sooo fast 
3671 2018-01-09 17:37:51 Just heard @SelenaGomez takes 2 shots of olive oil before performing. Wow! We’d love to help. Hit us up for a bottle of premium Olive Tree olive oil.
3672 2018-01-09 17:37:41 Will be on @trtworld Money Talks in a few to discuss #oil & #tankers
3673 2018-01-09 17:37:28 I swear Walmart is the worst place to get an oil change. I hate sitting here for my entire day just to pay up the fucking wazoo.
3674 2018-01-09 17:37:28 Ordered my tires today  - tint getting done Monday - leveling kit going on tomorrow - oil change today - now I just need rims 
3675 2018-01-09 17:37:21 Ororo no be crude oil.
3676 2018-01-09 17:37:18 Cinnamon and honey mix. Can either add it to tea or take a bit on a spoon. Oregano oil pills, can help too.
3677 2018-01-09 17:37:17 Likewise they all come together in terror attacks but can’t even hand one another a slice of bread. If they steal due to starvation they get their limbs cut off that religion is a cancer to humanity is why for hundreds of years they haven’t achieved shit but wealth through oil
3678 2018-01-09 17:37:13 La estación de servicio Oil de La Plata se negó a hacerme una factura por las compras en el mini mercado. AFIP estará controlando a Oil?
3679 2018-01-09 17:37:10 Are you talking to me?

3682 2018-01-09 17:36:21 US oil output will rise more than 10% by November 2019 EIA forecast
The EIA is out with its latest US oil production estimates. They see production this year at 10.27mbpd compared to 10.02m in their previous estimate.
3683 2018-01-09 17:36:14 guys help me, I can't stop thinking about keith in the middle of the desert fixing up his hoverbike in a cream tank top covered in oil and grease and his hair up in a ponytail
3684 2018-01-09 17:36:11 I have been bed ridden for the better part of a week, so I was in no shape to make it to Oakland today. Our coverage will entail articles, analysis, FB Live, and a podcast or two. Burning the midnight oil on this.
3685 2018-01-09 17:35:52 Oil hits highest price since Dec 2014.
3686 2018-01-09 17:35:52 Economy continues to be in the doghouse, rural wage growth is faltering, sme guys suffering, oil rising, interest rates rising, fiscal deficit widening. Still, the animal spirits is on! If liquidity is not the biggest driver of asset prices, what is?
3687 2018-01-09 17:35:52 I agree with you we don't need offshore drilling. But we do need oil. There's plenty of oil on land. I live in Oklahoma and I hate fracking. it's as dangerous as offshore drilling. It's messing up the platelets in the Earth and causing us to have many more earthquakes.
3688 2018-01-09 17:35:48 Every #Alaskan citizen over the age of 6 months receives an oil dividend check of about $1000 per year!
3689 2018-01-09 17:35:43 And, the GOPS gave the big oil company's another huge brake by dropping charge $ that went into slush fund for oil spill disasters.   Just awful!!!!
3690 2018-01-09 17:35:35 Even if Roman sell Chelsea they will continue to be a big club,Roman would have sponsored  by his oil Company like the Sheikhs are doing at City and PSG but he decided that Chelsea find great sponsors by them selves
3691 2018-01-09 17:35:19 Oil
3692 2018-01-09 17:35:17 That Tax Cut for Billionaires bill you voted for won't eliminate over $100 million from the fund to help clean-up maritime oil spills and several other funds across multiple agencies dealing with coastal and wildlife restoration will it?
3693 2018-01-09 17:35:07 Today’s been a productive day! Went to get an oil change, fixed my screen on my phone, cleaning the car! Next is get a new phone then Sephora maybe
3694 2018-01-09 17:35:02 So i'm here watching Rusty Rivets (don't ask) and like??? Where are the adults?? Why are they letting their children get in submarines and fix oil spills before they even hit puberty??? That's some A+ Parenting right there :)
3695 2018-01-09 17:35:00 Thank God you can't drill for oil there.
3696 2018-01-09 17:34:34 vape oil. Please I must see
3697 2018-01-09 17:34:25 Idk about acne/breakouts but just plain ol’ aloe will help with redness and irritation. I use tea tree oil as a spot treatment, but too much too often dries the area out.

3699 2018-01-09 17:34:13 Drive faster when it finally rains after 6 months. The accumulated oil on the road increases traction.
3700 2018-01-09 17:34:06 oil prices in the USA will go up just to blackmail the populace into approving drilling off our coasts.  NO.  NO NO.
3701 2018-01-09 17:34:02 You’re brother @BradWark says it’s hooey but I’ve been diffusing oils constantly at work and my cold is going away after 4 days. Started coughing this morning and put peppermint oil in diffuser...no coughing! 
3702 2018-01-09 17:33:59 It’s raining and I have the door open and essential oil diffuser on. 
3703 2018-01-09 17:33:51 Too bad that pristine shoreline will be covered by oil rigs
3704 2018-01-09 17:33:47 /1 Serious question:  How is the constant lying, bad faith politics, and obvious awfulness better than just coming out and saying what the GOP wants in any situation?  If they just said "we're squeezing every last dollar out of oil until it's gone, screw the future" would it be

PM: Biorè charcoal wash, cerave pm moisturizer, tea tree oil on pimples, and coconut oil
3716 2018-01-09 17:32:13 I don’t think this comes close to the destruction of ocean habitat you and other Retrumplicans are about to cause with your roll back of environmental regulations, oil drilling regulations clean air and water regulations and opening all of our nations waters to oil drilling.
3717 2018-01-09 17:32:12 No it is 9:25 am not 10:15. $BABA was 10:15 am cool
3718 2018-01-09 17:32:10 We finally got oil last night. It was not a fun 2 days.
3719 2018-01-09 17:32:10 My fiance takes garden of life probiotics, as well as a capsule of peppermint oil every day and his GERD is COMPLETELY taken care of!
3720 2018-01-09 17:32:10 Still looking like a big year next year for oil production #OOTT - @EIAgov now sees an increase of 980K bpd in production in 2018.
3721 2018-01-09 17:32:04 You must be wanting synthetic oil... that is pricier. I looked at Sears for my moms car and they had coupons online to cut that price down to 50$
3722 2018-01-09 17:31:56 I got pseudomonas for about 1 year after quad bypass surgery. I have never counted the number of positive test but more than 7. Cured my pseudomonas with “wild” Oregano oil and fresh squeezed large garlic!

.5lb of Argentina Shrimp
Lemon herb seasoning
Mexican blend or mozzarella cheese
Tortillas 
Season shrimp in a bowl of lemon juice and seasoning let it sit for 5 mins
Cook shrimp in a tablespoon of olive oil for  8-10 mins on medium
Then make the quesadillas
3725 2018-01-09 17:31:14 It’s simple, use old coffee grounds and make your own. Mix with coconut oil!!
3726 2018-01-09 17:31:14 Sooo, we drill next to other countries, or buy THEIR oil because they deserve the risk, not us?  That's your logic?  You need help.
3727 2018-01-09 17:31:12 Ahm.. actually, OLIVE OIL! Lol
3728 2018-01-09 17:31:04 Awful vengeful man with multiple "side gigs" namely for oil companies which he wastes parliamentary time on probably.

3759 2018-01-09 17:26:18 I see some people getting excited about the strong US #oil demand growth in the @EIAgov's STEO forecast for 2018 and 2019. I would be careful here as the majority of demand growth stems from upcoming ethane crackers. #OOTT
3760 2018-01-09 17:26:01 Moderate policy according to Bill Kristol = Stripping regulations for banking and limiting consumer protections.  Massive federal subsidies for oil and gas.

3764 2018-01-09 17:25:36 Well refining & petrochemicals are different businesses. Higher polypropylene prices would boost petchem business but higher oil prices would dampen refining business. For Chennai Petro, refining business is bigger contributor to revenue than petchem.

3782 2018-01-09 17:21:43 Cold heater when it's set to be warm? Head gasket is my guess. Just means it's not cracked on the cylinder side. That's why it's not mixing with the oil. It's leaking out of the block.
3783 2018-01-09 17:21:28 Well not really - infact would act as a dampener for oil marketing companies as cost of raw material would go up.

3785 2018-01-09 17:21:28 What has increased is oil whose API gravity is higher than 45. The US refineries will not touch it and this oil has to find an export home.

3795 2018-01-09 17:20:33 Satan has been the best friend the Church has ever had, as he has kept it in business all these years. In this case, the church is the medical orthodoxy. Drugs, sugar, vegetable oil, and plants.
3796 2018-01-09 17:20:31 Please stop sucking up to U.S. farmers, you wouldn’t hesitate, in a heartbeat, to sell their farms to the oil/gas industry, so you could make a personal profit.
3797 2018-01-09 17:20:06 Why You Should Start Mixing Face Oil With Your Foundation ASAP
3798 2018-01-09 17:20:05 If your company was energy delivery, and not extraction, refining, etc. then oil & gas is not the expertise.  Systems & process would be the expertise.
3799 2018-01-09 17:20:01 Absolutely act on all fronts but sustainable biomass WAY better than oil or coal when all impacts considered.

3844 2018-01-09 17:15:05 I know my car bro. They gonna sit here and try to tell me it doesn’t. Shid cmon bro.  It also doesn’t take 1hr 30 min to change oil. Then try to tell me I have to get my transmission flushed and all types of other ish. These dealers man.
3845 2018-01-09 17:15:04 Weird. In the conventional world we see the beginning of the end of the well when the GOR increases as we go through bubble/dew point. The gas rate here is falling faster than oil rate? Strange.  Banked condensate? If that can happen in shale...
3846 2018-01-09 17:14:59 Thank you for speaking the truth! We don't need the oil! It's a step backwards when we must step forward to a cleaner greener future! #climatechange

3903 2018-01-09 17:09:43 Had been talks since 2015 if I recall correctly but seems more realistic now.  It shouldn’t really affect debt sustainability as debt levels are low and with oil prices where they are currently it could be decently priced. So timing will be interesting if they do come to market.

3934 2018-01-09 17:07:23 Yes, you are absolutely correct.  It could be anyone.  As you know, the impact of the price war in 2015 was felt everywhere and did affect offshore worldwide.  In fact, the first victim of the price war was China when it shut down its marginal oil wells.

4008 2018-01-09 17:00:21 I understand where you are coming from @SamFarah10, the thing limiting Somaliland is lack of recognition, delaying major deals like oil & outside investment, without that recognition it is hard to uplift the nation. On the other hand i do think use of funds can be optimized.

4066 2018-01-09 16:54:24 If you look at North Sea Oil, Scotland is allocated around 90% of all NSO revenues in GERS - it's called a "geographical share" it's best case scenario and we still run a £15bn deficit!
4067 2018-01-09 16:54:22 Fair enough but that argument could then be applied to every producer in the world capable of adding an incremental 50-100 kb/d like tight oil for a year or so. No one is talking about OPEC's war on Brazil that added 750 kb/d in the first half of 2017.

4072 2018-01-09 16:53:35 So I avoided palm oil, scrupulously for year or so (so, no diarist here). I ate, to test, Nairn's organic oat biscuits. Palm fruit oil, perhaps in anti-microbial action, tranquilises. Both properties may lend some evidence to craving consumption and  antibiotic resistance?

4112 2018-01-09 16:49:45 That too. But electricity needs to replace oil in transportation. Doing so would substantially increase electricity demand.
4113 2018-01-09 16:49:26 Natural gas is non-renewable and the burning of it releases methane which is a stronger green house gas than carbon dioxide. And yes, it is found in the same locations as oil.

4124 2018-01-09 16:48:48 It’s derived from coconut oil. It’s basically a high fat oil you can add to things (smoothies, coffee, dressings, sauces, etc) that’s kind of an energy boost - used often when doing the Keto diet, as I am.
4125 2018-01-09 16:48:46 Those who want offshore drilling and the stupid wall pay for the clean up of an oil spill and the building of a wall. They want both. They pay for both. Sounds like a great idea to me. How about you?
4126 2018-01-09 16:48:39 If you want to help us, make more energy efficient options available to us. More farms have fallen to oil rigs than anything in the past twenty years, not laws and regulations that keep our earth healthy

4133 2018-01-09 16:48:07 I've been driving electric for 2.5 years and Tesla announced an all electric semi. Not sure why oil would be "needed" in the future for any segment of transport. Except perhaps flights (for a while).
4134 2018-01-09 16:47:55 Hey y’all! I’m saying goodbye to my pixie and going to attempt to grow out my hair. Do you have any suggestions for ways to do it fast? I know about Biotin and Fish Oil, but any tips and tricks would be super helpful! 
(Also emotional support lol)
4135 2018-01-09 16:47:44 Basically it's the same thing.radiator cools the water in the cooling system. If you have water in your oil your engine casing is cracked somewhere. Or if your dripping off your radiator or near car front then it's radiator /pipes to it

4144 2018-01-09 16:47:02 Froze solid you say? Well up here in Canada, all along the north shore of Lake Erie ours were annoying us as usual. Changing to a winter grade synthetic oil as part of a winterizing package has paid off. You do know that All-Season means the opposite. Same as Global Warming.
4145 2018-01-09 16:47:01 Unfortunately for us shorts the bulls are still strong.
4146 2018-01-09 16:46:45 Did you speak out against Trump and Zinke? They intentionally want to destroy the land for oil.
4147 2018-01-09 16:46:32 Can some explain why it’s so hard to find cbd oil? Like only in Utah would it be secretly legal.
4148 2018-01-09 16:46:29 Mundo Deportivo - The signing of Coutinho does not stop Barça's interest for next summer targets: Griezmann and Arthur.

Is Barto now in possession some oil wells in Qatar?
4149 2018-01-09 16:46:29 This is unbelievable.  But Trump wants to drill all over our country for oil. He wants nore coal mines. Stupid dangerous man.

4170 2018-01-09 16:44:23 That’s why he needs to destroy environment and sell all national parks and waters to oil companies! Who will pay these trillions?
4171 2018-01-09 16:44:14 When I make my car payment every month, I pay an extra $25-30 into Toyota Protection so whenever I need an oil change, new tires or even most major repairs, its covered. I dont have to pay. Anything.

Wouldnt it be great if there were a program like that for our own human bodies?
4172 2018-01-09 16:44:11 Getting this day started right. Great Mashup workout @FitmixStudio followed by an oil change and now it’s meeting time. Bring it 2018
4173 2018-01-09 16:44:09 Maybe Trudeau should suggest cutting BC off from oil supplies and make empty threats to get what he wants. Would that be satisfactory?

4178 2018-01-09 16:43:27 Vincent, less than 1% primary energy supply comes from wind and solar.  

There’s too much heavy lifting to get to renewables nirvana in a short period, unless you want to cut off power to Granny

Gas for power will be with us for a long time.  And oil will be needed transport.

4182 2018-01-09 16:43:22 I've had really good luck with flaxseed oil (linseed oil) in three or four layers as thin as you can manage at the highest baking temperature the oven will do (not clean)
4183 2018-01-09 16:43:16 The mining jobs were predominately in the gas and oil industry. The farming industry will lose how many workers due to deportation? What affect did stepping out of TPP have on farm exports?

4193 2018-01-09 16:42:04 Whether an offer sheet was imminent or not (Gregor's Oilersnation article from June 29 suggested there were only a few teams that could), it is at least debatable that it would not have been the worst possible outcome. Based on Leon's new deal the Oil would likely have matched.
4194 2018-01-09 16:42:04 Someone came up to me and asked what I was doing as I was sitting in Audi (waiting for my oil change) listening to #CardoneU I showed him @GrantCardone and gave him my personal copy of #booklettomillions told him to get  #10x rule... today is a good day

4197 2018-01-09 16:41:57 Additionally,  he has taken off the safety regulations set after the last major catastrophe.   Then he eliminated the 9 cent per barrel as a set aside to pay for cleanup of any future oil spills.  What could go wrong
4198 2018-01-09 16:41:55 where do you think this could end?
4199 2018-01-09 16:41:50 Good fuckin thing the #Oilers aren’t run by the fans. The majority of Oil fans on Twitter are absolutely batshit.

4205 2018-01-09 16:41:18 Common misconception about the soap though... if your seasoning is done right it won't effect anything. Polymerized oil is like a plastic that has adhered to the pan it's quit difficult to remove without a heavy degreaser and steel wool.

4209 2018-01-09 16:41:02 the co-founder of Zara is the 4th richest person in the world at 67.1 billion. He ranks richer than those who own oil fields and he's just a copy-cat capitalist stealing designs from great creative minds. 
4210 2018-01-09 16:40:47 you really must research before you tweet; the material to make solar panels & storage batteries are not renewable.   takes a lot of oil to dig out of ground transport , build.  than they are toxic in land fills.  read more
4211 2018-01-09 16:40:40 Oil prices highest they’ve been since 2015. I guess whatever I would have saved with the so-called “tax cut” will be eaten up in paying more to drive and heat my home. #ThanksTrump

4220 2018-01-09 16:40:11 The drilling is going to happen somewhere in the world because the demand for oil is so high.  Instead of lobbying against it being in your back yard, lobby for technologies that make it obsolete.  Common sense.

Always remember, this is soft data. The flip side is hype.

The GOP are owned by special interests (Big Ag, Oil, Gas & Focus on Family. )They're trying to take my civil rights & public lands & clean air & water away.That is war.I dont "unify " with my enemy .
4279 2018-01-09 16:34:48 took my car to get a $20 oil change, Ended up trying to get me to pay $300+ for all this other shit! like no, hell no Not today Satan! 
4280 2018-01-09 16:34:47 Voltaren is a life saviour. Rub eucalyptus oil on your shoulders! Helps with colds as well. I personally like white flower oil because it gives you a tingly sensation. Get a massage as well!
4281 2018-01-09 16:34:42 The damn pipeline has already spewing thousands of gallons of oil, we  warned and you jailed them. That's like smart huh?
4282 2018-01-09 16:34:36 There was a step flash mob during lunch it was pretty fucking dope
4283 2018-01-09 16:34:36 Let’s not be dependent on other countries for stuff we have here. Oil is a planet problem, not a USA problem.

4287 2018-01-09 16:34:22 Basic question, but does heating for that period affect the chemical structure at all - I.e. produce toxic byproducts like the sh*t you get with rapeseed oil upon heating?
4288 2018-01-09 16:34:19 Pay for performance, interested if Pilgrim will be forced to pay for the expensive dirty oil fired replacement power. 800MW x 7 days at ~250MWH=????$$$$!!!!

4297 2018-01-09 16:33:46 1. He answered that! He uses yoghurt, coconut oil and eggs to massage his hair.
2. I WANT HIS SKINCARE ROUTINE!!!! 
3. Let’s measure his eyelash lengths and get ourselves a pair 
4. I HAVE NO FCKNG IDEA! HE NEEDS TO GET OFF HIS *** AND MAKE WAY TO TWITTER!!!
4298 2018-01-09 16:33:45 Oil... Heated at high temperature... Bursting open...
4299 2018-01-09 16:33:41 There are fears of an environmental disaster in the East China Sea as a tanker continues leaking oil two days after colliding with a cargo ship. Chinese officials have told state media the Sanchi is in danger of exploding and sinking.
4300 2018-01-09 16:33:34 ... oil that was there. And also too mamy people were killed in Iraq for it to be classified as 'humanitarian'. Not to mention that it's now under de facto Iranian control - a backfired plan.
4301 2018-01-09 16:33:34 And, he will then open it up to oil drilling...
4302 2018-01-09 16:33:27 We all know the fuel thing was paid for by the oil lobbyists to show the dangers of a lack of fossil fuel in space.  The ships stopping at the BP gas station in the middle of the movie while Holdo swipes her BP reward card and winks at the camera gave it away.  #TheLastJedi

4311 2018-01-09 16:32:30 Arriba de 60. El break even en upstream dicen que es de 45 casi como el shale en usa pero es medio mentiroso. Con estos valores y más en backwardation el oil, long Vaca muerta.
4312 2018-01-09 16:32:29 Another day of looking majestic as fuck and going out. Even if it’s just to get my oil changed and other mild errands, I will look hot regardless.  #findom
4313 2018-01-09 16:32:25 So far  all I have heard  is that you are in the pocket of oil companies,  pharmaceutical  companies and manufacturers.  You care NOTHING about the health and safety of the American people and the land we all live in.

4315 2018-01-09 16:32:18 Here I am using my visa gift card from christmas to pay for an oil change. Growing up.. yeah, not a fan.
4316 2018-01-09 16:32:10 Went to see why check engine light was on yesterday & get oil change. It's the thermostat.
4317 2018-01-09 16:32:03 Here's hyperinflation scenarios. 
1. Climate change collapses food. Govt tries to buy more food than exists.
2. All out War with China. Govt tries to buy more labor than exists.
3. Global oil shortage. Price skyrockets. Govt also tries to buy more oil than exists.
u get it
4318 2018-01-09 16:32:02 I would have say holdup!! As I'm pulling that dress up and over your head....you baby can't go anywhere without a massage in an oil stretch.

4321 2018-01-09 16:31:38 No big oil spill found after tanker-ship collusion: China
4322 2018-01-09 16:31:38 Well your country has always got a lame excuse to put his nose on oil rich countries, by the way in your research did your country found any mass destruction wepeons in Iraq??
4323 2018-01-09 16:31:36 Hi,  I want deal with oil recycling and need advise and any mentorship from u as a big company from Constance (RSA)
4324 2018-01-09 16:31:35 Well come on. Govt's take increases since oil price ramps up.
4325 2018-01-09 16:31:34 black seed oil got me feeling crazy
4326 2018-01-09 16:31:32 We have not seen tanks rolling like they roll in South East and South South because there is no oil to protect in Benue. Show us pictures of tanks deployed to curtail Fulani herdsmen massacres.
4327 2018-01-09 16:31:26 Heating my house with oil like some fuckin Alaskan bush man
4328 2018-01-09 16:31:24 We have to use youth because of the Glazers . 
If we had oil money we wud be doing same as city n Chelsea
4329 2018-01-09 16:31:22 Yeah. The legacy of relying on oil and 44 years of PC mismanagement and neglect that we’re still paying for.

4337 2018-01-09 16:30:31 Hey knew that It would cause this term oil to help promote there product, internet manipulation. They have to get all these clothes and phrases clear and copy written . People just need to use common sense and shut up .
4338 2018-01-09 16:30:30 Big thanks to my bf for cleaning out my car and putting oil in it while I was in class 
4339 2018-01-09 16:30:26 Question- Can oil be drilled in International waters off our coasts? (that is, by other countries 12 miles off) —
4340 2018-01-09 16:30:17 Guy in the work café, late 60s/early 70s, on the phone, YELLING AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS about a bunch of topics - cops, fire, oil change, tire rotation, whether or not he'll get that phone call, and HOW CAN IT WIPE OUT AN ALTERNATOR?!!!!! 
4341 2018-01-09 16:30:13 and tomorrow he will open it up for oil drilling.

4351 2018-01-09 16:28:24 Hempseed capsules and CBD oil has done more for me than 20 yrs. of prescriptions drugs. I'm on disability so I am saving taxpayers thousands
4352 2018-01-09 16:28:14 The language in H.R. 4532 precludes any type of mining, and development of oil or gas within the 1.35 million acres of the original Bears Ears Monument.
4353 2018-01-09 16:28:14 YOU don’t need the oil but the poor do! Policies that limit the #supply of oil cause prices to be artificially higher! If oil comp’s. are willing to put money up for oil exploration then it is a profitable endeavor and is GREAT for consumers. Dems. party of the poor? #YeahRight

4355 2018-01-09 16:27:57 Except in oil.  Remember the CONgressional hearings on the "evil speculators" when it was over $100 (I think closer to $120) a bbl years ago?  Equity market "heros" get put onto magazine covers and work for Citadel for $250k lunches....  #winning

4366 2018-01-09 16:27:11  great article. As a Habs fan I agree 100%, and was actually surprised the Canadiens didn't win the big prize. But it's so true about the Oil, huge expectations and terrible results....so far.

4375 2018-01-09 16:26:35 H1b policy can be equated to China invading small islands in Southeast Asia. Small countries cant do anything. They have been fried on their own oil. It is like American middle class cant do anything on their own country. @realDonaldTrump @RepulicanNguyen @Dawnnewyorker
4376 2018-01-09 16:26:33 ... then the rock star, the pure pol, the Machiavelli, the peanut farmer, the movie star, another pure pol, the oil scion, the community organizer and the reality TV star. (Sticking here to elected POTUSes.)

4378 2018-01-09 16:26:19 The #US government has ignored 9/11 attack that was done by 17 Saudi terrorists because os Saudi oil & money.!

I'm surprised why the international community is complaining of terrorism & at the same time they support the kingdom of terrorism?!

4383 2018-01-09 16:25:51 Peppermint oil offers some good temporary relief from a migraine/headache but you have to smell like a Christmas cookie all day.
4384 2018-01-09 16:25:47 That kept happening to me ...  have you tried Tea tree oil?
4385 2018-01-09 16:25:46 that's ignorant, IMHO.  It's the same people, not oil and water.
Historical records show countless puppeteers, due to strategic geography of Balkans, have been at root of conflicts & of changing demographics; religious, genetic, etc.
People are fine, though exploited always
4386 2018-01-09 16:25:40 These "facts" are wrong. The NPS alone has a $12 billion maintenance backlog. In September Zinke told a room full of rangers he would use offshore oil lease money to pay it down, then weeks later announces the fee increases to pay for it. Liars, crooks, and charlatans. ALL of you
4387 2018-01-09 16:25:30 This bill precludes any type of mining, development of oil or gas within the boundaries of the 1.35 million acres of the original Bears Ears Monument.
4388 2018-01-09 16:25:28 But we DO need the oil independence and export good place to start
4389 2018-01-09 16:25:10 I was looking at repurchasing that one too but remembered how much @TheAnnaEdit loves the oil free Laura Mercier one so went for that! Usually I get the Illuminating one 
4390 2018-01-09 16:25:07 So be sure to fully fund FEMA and recognize that #ClimateChangeIsReal. Also it's probably not a good time to remove the oil tax to fund oil cleanup.
4391 2018-01-09 16:25:00 you gotta stop getting out of bed like you’re an oil spill. 
you’re not a flat tire at 2am.

4399 2018-01-09 16:24:26 Have reduced some oil stocks. Can not find anyone who is not bullish yet inventories are high and oil curve inverted. I.e. lower outer years than spot. Added to Sopheon. Top position by miles now

4401 2018-01-09 16:24:18 perfect timing - I need an oil change & snow tires! 
4402 2018-01-09 16:24:13 RT @SenFeinstein: Expanding offshore oil drilling is another short-sighted, terrible idea from the Trump administration. The risks are far too high, the environmental damage would be irreversible and we don’t need the oil. Let’s make sure this never happens!
4403 2018-01-09 16:24:12 I got a humidifier with essential oil diffuser for the bedroom and it actually might’ve helped me sleep better last night.  I was actually able to breathe!

4414 2018-01-09 16:23:24 Hydro vs Dirty oil, you are really missing the big picture. We are locked in to fouling our air, and taxing ratepayers during winter and summer peaks. Last two weeks generation cost was often over $300mw, (7500mw load coal and oil) and higher @Curt_Nordgaard
4415 2018-01-09 16:23:22 I got the argon oil one that smells like rose jam!!!

4419 2018-01-09 16:23:01 In my experience frequency and adhesion are related to my fat intake (tallow, ghee, coconut oil..).. if you're not having stomach pain probably not backed up, but you can use MCT oil to get things moving

4422 2018-01-09 16:22:38 Change oil with your dad? That’s so wrong ^)
4423 2018-01-09 16:22:36 Argan oil as a facial moisturizer is the truth. Stay informed 
4424 2018-01-09 16:22:36 Coconut oil? My friend uses it for her daughters hair and it works wonders
4425 2018-01-09 16:22:32 I guess his oil buddies didn't get enough with the tax cuts so he sweeten the deal for them. So what do we do that you can't do? Tell us and will do it.
4426 2018-01-09 16:22:27 this has been working pretty good for me! 
1. ponds cold cream cleanser (takes off makeup + cleans face) 
2. lush grease lighting (tea tree oil - rly good for getting rid of acne) 
3. first aid beauty ultra repair cream (I don't do this every night - only if my skin is rly dry)
4427 2018-01-09 16:22:23 @DiscountTirei bought my tires about 16 months ago i was at a oil change service and was told i am in desperate need of tire replacement due to very low tread I have a warranty does a tire need to be damaged to enact warranty? or if they are a road hazard does that work?
4428 2018-01-09 16:22:19 I bought coconut oil for the first time. I'm hoping to have super powers by Sunday. I don't know what to do with it But ke there's Girl talk lentuzana
4429 2018-01-09 16:22:10 Should have known oil last year was a flash sale and loaded up. Back to almost $70/barrel now
4430 2018-01-09 16:22:09 Itu tadi malem kalo pagi rangkaiannya sama aja dari no 1-6. Cuma no 7 ganti. 

7. Moisturizer pake the fresh for men dari face shop cm gak terlalu enak sih. Sekarang lagi coba pake Kiehl’s oil eliminator for men. 

8. Terakhir pke sunscreen dari biore uv aqua rich yg hype itu

4438 2018-01-09 16:21:13 Yeah I just saw that too but cats are way more sensitive to essential oils then dogs, I diffuse around my dog all the time and he’s okay but I haven’t touched my tea tree oil bc I read it is toxic for dogs so I think I’ll just put that one away! Lol
4439 2018-01-09 16:21:05 The bit that gets me is that the apparantly biased yoon media played along celebrating the ‘ban’.  I’ve banned my dug from the couch.  Fortunately he’s a bit more subservient that oil company lawyers*

4449 2018-01-09 16:20:26 Hope it's not made from coconut oil for a change!
4450 2018-01-09 16:20:24 Make sure you don’t use anything with coconut oil on your face, I know it’s a trend now but it’s highly acnegenic. I found my sunscreen had some in it and I was getting AWFUL breakouts

Today Cdn oil (WCS) is selling ($25.35) below Texas oil (WTI) & Cdn Syn ($3.95) less than WTI   We make ourselves poorer & others richer Go Canada Go!

4466 2018-01-09 16:18:55 First of all that idea would’ve went over 20 to 25 years ago, but Oil drilling, especially in the waters are way more safer today, and as for the one in the Gulf of Mexico the year that Obama took over that blew up was purposely done, and I’m not blaming Obama.

4468 2018-01-09 16:18:52 Game day prediction: Chia's interviews are a wake up call and the Oilers look like an NHL team once again. 3-1 Oil with a goal from Lucic and Strome gets a point.
4469 2018-01-09 16:18:51 Happy Birthday @DeepFriedMan... I'm guessing this is the day you originally fell in the vat of oil? Sort of like Obelix, but instead of super strength, you received super comic agility... I could be wrong.
4470 2018-01-09 16:18:48 I work in private equity oil & gas. I can't think of a more traditionally conservative group (religion aside). There are people I respect that voted for Trump. There are people in the same education/income demo that refused to (even tho they voted Bush/Romney).
4471 2018-01-09 16:18:46 Started using coconut oil as moisturizer all over my body and my skin has never felt so hydrated def recommend
4472 2018-01-09 16:18:45 What is that oil cake all about?
4473 2018-01-09 16:18:33 what I was thinking also but getting the two main ones together be like oil & water

4480 2018-01-09 16:18:02 When he feel like just because he paying for the oil change he shouldn’t have to take it to get the oil change  But I won’t complain 
4481 2018-01-09 16:17:58 One cannot mix oil and water
4482 2018-01-09 16:17:57 Why vote Dem in 2018?
In 1989 after Exon Valedz oil spill, industry was taxed ¢9/barrel for oil spill clean up fund which was killed in Dec by Rep.
W.H. also is getting rid of 2 offshore safety measures put in place after a 2010 spill bec they r overly burdensome on oil industry!
4483 2018-01-09 16:17:53 I heard the Trump administration is rolling back a ton of safety regulations for the oil industry for off shore drilling. This is a powder keg about to explode. All over our beaches and marine life.

4490 2018-01-09 16:17:09 The Secy of Interior and Head of the EPA weren't hired to protect the land; they were hired to unprotect the land. Their goal has been to open the land up for exploitation of its natural resources by big oil and other destructive corporations.

4492 2018-01-09 16:16:50 I remember a time when castor oil (not for your hair) had this repugnant smell and colour. Seems like that no more. The tremor of my childhood after festive eating was done, a spoon or two of castor oil 
4493 2018-01-09 16:16:33 should squeak by the Bears at Hard Rock. Colts at Lucas Oil is a toss-up. 5-11

4498 2018-01-09 16:15:18 thankfully oil companies know about the blue wave coming and won't invest in what they know will be repealed as soon as democrats are back in power...
4499 2018-01-09 16:15:16 MCT oil in my coffee is far, far far superior to coconut oil. I'm so glad I made this switch.
4500 2018-01-09 16:15:08 There is proof that the Mediterranean diet including olive oil is healthy

4502 2018-01-09 16:15:02 Oil prices hit highs not seen since May 2015 supported by OPC-led production cuts and expectations of lower U.S. crude inventories.
4503 2018-01-09 16:14:52 Sardine oil and unsliced bread is so underrated
4504 2018-01-09 16:14:50 He's not dealt with Russia and China who ignored him and sent oil to N Korea. Half of Puerto Rico still doesn't have power, and 500 have died; where's help for USVI? Etc, etc...

4506 2018-01-09 16:14:44 Go Greenwald!  He succinctly characterizes the bloody role that the US has perpetrated in the US in the name of protecting oil reserves for our country’s consumption.  Shame on you Bill Maher!
4507 2018-01-09 16:14:43 She is scientifically illiterate and amazingly susceptible to charlatans, whether they are doctors selling snake oil or writers peddling lies. She's terrific at telling us to be nice to each other. That is not what we need.

4509 2018-01-09 16:14:33 4) The cost of petrol / diesel T going UP inspite of Internal Oil prices being down.

4525 2018-01-09 16:13:00 Expanding offshore oil drilling is another short-sighted, terrible idea from the Trump administration. The risks are far too high, the environmental damage would be irreversible and we don’t need the oil. Let’s make sure this never happens!

4556 2018-01-09 16:10:18 It won’t be the first time in earth’s history that the arctic has thawed. The reason there is oil to be found in the arctic is that at one time it was a rain forest. But I guess that was caused from dinosaur farts.

4588 2018-01-09 16:06:16 Coconut oil is good, no it's bad. Olive oil is best... Different oils have varied properties, different smoke points and can be used to enhance food depending on what and how you are cooking. I'm all for changing opinions but jumping on the flow of a popular belief is pointless.

4709 2018-01-09 15:54:51 it’s probably because they use the same oil over and over with them. they jus filter it and reuse it. shit is trifling
4710 2018-01-09 15:54:49 I would also like to give a shoutout to my mechanic. I dropped Jane Honda off for an oil change this morning and I asked, "do you need anything else from me?" and he said JUST A HIGH FIVE and honestly that's my exact vibe

4713 2018-01-09 15:54:21 She joins Graham, Falwell and Robertson is crying. Snake oil sales are abysmal at all the charlatan Sunday meeting places.
4714 2018-01-09 15:54:19 That's certainly part of it in my book. Hopefully it serves as strong resistance.
4715 2018-01-09 15:54:19 พอครบ8ตัวมันจะมีคนเอาไปเรียงกันเป็นเพลงแห่งอนาคตแน้ๆ 
4716 2018-01-09 15:54:16 文学部潰したら、心理学とか社会学とかの発展が止まって、「経験則」に則ったクソみたいな人間観が蔓延るだろうし、外国文学とか言語学とか民俗学とかが消えて文化が乏しくなりそう(素人感)
4717 2018-01-09 15:54:08 You can tell it doesn’t rain often in Vegas; it’s washing an iridescent slick of oil and grime into the artificial grass and when people step on it, their feet make little soapy bubbles.
4718 2018-01-09 15:54:07 Are you unhappy with your body wash because it dries your skin out ? Put a few tablespoons of baby oil in it. Shake before each use!
4719 2018-01-09 15:53:49 Why can’t we look to #renewableenergy for #Pennsylvania @GovernorTomWolf?! The whole oil & gas industry has their hands in our legislators pockets. #fracking is harmful. #pipelines blow. What will it take to put PEOPLE first?! #noME2 #stopETP #INEOSvThePeople
4720 2018-01-09 15:53:49 From @Midget_Rage 
3 tablespoons of coffee grounds
1 tablespoon of brown sugar
1 tablespoon of oil

Mix coffee & brown sugar together first, then add the oil. You can add more brown sugar or coffee if you want a grittier scrub. Wet your face with warm water, exfoliate, and rinse
4721 2018-01-09 15:53:49 What source can you provide regarding misappropriated funds on oil? Puerto Rico is part of the US. So where is the stance on that? And sludge in fresh streams?
4722 2018-01-09 15:53:46 Disclaimer, my daughter isn’t mixed, but she did have straight hair for a bit. I used water and baby or olive oil. When detangling, even now, I hold the hair gently, but firmly and comb until the tangle is gone and go towards the root until the tangles are gone.
4723 2018-01-09 15:53:45 I should really invest in that Tea Tree oil thingo ng The Body Shop kasi I'm breaking out so much recently and my skin is a bitch so
4724 2018-01-09 15:53:41 Where are our anti-trust regulators....too busy enjoying billions made from Bezos. Were JD Rockefeller with us he would reconstitute Standard Oil and do the same and tell government to take a walk
4725 2018-01-09 15:53:40 And one of the world's highest exporter of Crude oil
4726 2018-01-09 15:53:01 アルバハお疲れ様でした　もっと精進します
4727 2018-01-09 15:53:00 do not get your car serviced at the pep boys in Forestville next to the aldis on Marlboro pike the customer service there is terrible specially the lady that works in the service department. Talk about a Unsufficient and a waste of time.I want my money back for free oil change.
4728 2018-01-09 15:52:49 she needs to anoint her eye brows with some castor oil. She rude.
4729 2018-01-09 15:52:47 ลอกน่ากลัวมากกกกก Body oil แน่นอน คิดว่าน่าจะไม่เช็ดตัว ละทาoil กับไม่อาบน้ำ555544
4730 2018-01-09 15:52:46 Squelching any job not related to war and oil. Hopefully rebuilding all public buildings to fallout shelter standards is part of it. I guess.
4731 2018-01-09 15:52:41 Yeah, leads the nation in, like, NON-outdoor retail job growth maybe. You and Gary are on a crusade to plant oil rigs under Delicate Arch and to strip mine Angel’s Landing! (*eye roll. drops SUWA talking points on the floor and goes to look for a Diet Coke.)
4732 2018-01-09 15:52:27 The majority of the oil is in the creek but some has spilt into the TN River. @WRCB
4733 2018-01-09 15:52:00 Peppermint oil capsules seem to do the trick for me.
4734 2018-01-09 15:51:59 perhaps if they changed their oil more often than every election.
4735 2018-01-09 15:51:59 Anyone ever used CBD oil? Or cbd with vape?!
4736 2018-01-09 15:51:40 haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! ikr.....she is a skallywag!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!cbd oil does nothing!
4737 2018-01-09 15:51:13 I just gave myself a hot oil treatment, it feels so good on my scalp
4738 2018-01-09 15:51:00 Went to schedule an oil change and my service center tried to suggest that at 15k miles to get a $260 tune up.  All I need is an oil change, thank you very much. 
4739 2018-01-09 15:50:50 Doesn’t Trump know that DPRK is not a source of immigrants, doesn’t host off-shored US factory jobs, and (cue drum roll) has no oil fields? He must have better constitution flouting business opportunities than a Pyongyang Trump tower.
4740 2018-01-09 15:50:46 @Chaturvedikk13 Sir, in response to an RTI filed last year I have learnt that India's largest state owned oil marketing company still does not have any norms in place for posting competent Quality Control Personnel at sensitive locations even as oil adulteration is rampant
4741 2018-01-09 15:50:39 I could never bear the steroid creams  etc. When mine used to be bad (pre CBD) I used a sunbed (especially in the depths of winter). Also make sure you’re not vit D deficient as this will make it flare (as well as being a patient, I work in healthcare). I also use coconut oil
4742 2018-01-09 15:50:30 Economies are driven by technological advances 
Solar and nanotech are leaving oil and coal in the dust
4743 2018-01-09 15:50:26 I've been letting coconut oil sit in my hair before washing and conditioning after bleaching out color that dark and my hair looks so HEALTHY - give it a try?
4744 2018-01-09 15:50:22 Christ on a manticore that's austere. Could you roast them a little with some garlic and a bit of olive oil and have them on a cheesy oatcake?
4745 2018-01-09 15:50:10 He hasn’t allowed anything yet. All are proposed and research being done.  And since my family lives and dies by the oil industry this means more stable jobs for them.  I’m ok with more drilling in the gulf and elsewhere offshore.
4746 2018-01-09 15:49:39 I think it has to do with the VAH

4753 2018-01-09 15:48:53 coconut oil 2018
4754 2018-01-09 15:48:52 Got some amazing calendula oil for C at @Jolenesoaps at @rivermrkt ... it worked amazing at the cabin where he gets crazy dry face.
4755 2018-01-09 15:48:42 there is an ad for an oil thats like the boozies in hollywood i believe i just saw it while lauren was playing
4756 2018-01-09 15:48:32 Mo in irony i meant you were a struggling club before Oil money came
4757 2018-01-09 15:48:21 My Ma uses oil instead of butter, and buttermilk (or milk with calamansi) and those make all the difference!
4758 2018-01-09 15:48:19 i drive all the way to Baytown to get an oil change at the dealership just to be told i needed an appt otherwise it was a 3 hr wait
4759 2018-01-09 15:48:19 I have lol got a really bad sunburn. Went to the wave pool with my friend i was about 10 . Her dads girlfriend put baby oil on my back  instead of sunscreen
4760 2018-01-09 15:48:19 Hahahahah oh my God
4761 2018-01-09 15:48:11 Coconut oil
4762 2018-01-09 15:47:58 Egg, mayo and olive oil hair mask 
4763 2018-01-09 15:47:56 wow, take away voting rights, screw up healthcare and open national monuments to oil and coal exploration.... But rename a local park as a national park and we'll call it even???
4764 2018-01-09 15:47:54 When your tangles it could need trim or its to dry,he's mixed so you have alot more struggle coming your way if you plan to keep his hair long ,try the smallest amount of coconut oil on his ends when wet you need to seal in moisture #cosmetologist 
4765 2018-01-09 15:47:32 BRING THEM BACK. Trying to run Congress without them makes ideological votes the default.  Machines need oil to run.
4766 2018-01-09 15:46:49 Squeaky wheel gets the oil
Despite being only 8% of the entire population
Apparently these nutballs just cant move on2 the next business
4767 2018-01-09 15:46:36 Your butter topping is made from soybean oil, soybean oil runs the risk of growing white mold. If you never clean the butter canister, the butter at the bottom will run risk of growing mold but ok.
4768 2018-01-09 15:46:32 Wide tooth combs make the biggest difference! Condition before bed or coconut oil help as well
4769 2018-01-09 15:46:24 my recipe was
- 2 slices of bread
- avocado (i didn't use the whole half of an avocado, just enough for 2 slices)
- juice of 1/2 lemon
- salt (as much as u want)
- 1/2tsp of curry
- cashew nuts (u slice them a bit)
- black pepper
- olive oil mixed w garlic

4773 2018-01-09 15:46:16 I asked my mom what she's cooking...lasagna. Said she found a recipie online . For 1, Someone is lying cause she don't eat sauce.  And who needs a recipie for lasagna?  I bet $100 it some weird veggie casserole with some funky olive oil sauce.
4774 2018-01-09 15:46:08 Also, I’m going to go get my oil change right now and my dad really wants to go so here’s looking forward to hearing about how I’ve been fucking up my life 
4775 2018-01-09 15:46:08 Try castor oil, hair oil, however compassionate to all.
4776 2018-01-09 15:46:06 Brad Hulbert says the en banc Wi-Fi One v. Broadcom decision may foreshadow ruling in Oil States v. Greene’s Energy, meaning #PTAB determinations of invalidity would be treated like district court determinations of invalidity.

4783 2018-01-09 15:45:05 Can we all just agree that anything with truffle oil should be banned from office environments? Physically gagging from smell wafting in the air. Also, who eats lunch at 9:40am?
4784 2018-01-09 15:45:05 Organic coconut oil. It will help.
4785 2018-01-09 15:44:51 I’m reading these and seeing a lot of “oil hair before shampoos” my mom never taught me this will someone tell me what that means ya girl is dusty

4787 2018-01-09 15:44:31 Sold AKS to protect gains.
GS almost got stopped out.
Added GEL and WLL before close yesterday, they are not that overbought as other oil stocks, WLL one of the key shale players I think.
4788 2018-01-09 15:44:28 I think he's referring to the long wick to the upside which is bearish assuming the wick stays intact.
4789 2018-01-09 15:44:24 Equity Investors - oil companies, Communist, Mideast oil barrens, etc
4790 2018-01-09 15:44:03 @HallieJackson you clearly don’t want to do another oprah story. Use the time to talk about trumps rollback of oil spill protections please.

4792 2018-01-09 15:43:33 oh damn girl, well glad mom knew best but that’s brutal. damn coconut oil  to be fair though, i heard it’s really not the best for most people’s skin either, great for hair but there’s tons of other oils that are better for the face!

4798 2018-01-09 15:42:39 For myself, I believe Oil and Gas offers lucrative paycheck. With that, I will have more flexibility to support my family.

I am not the person joining the industry with passion. Else, I would have scored first class degree during my tertiary education .
4799 2018-01-09 15:42:36 Drain the tofu.

4805 2018-01-09 15:41:48 The US LTO industry has shot itself in both feet already. OPEC is giving it  just enough rope to now shoot itself in both knee caps. OPEC knows all about LTO saturated sweet spots, poor well economics, and shale oil debt. Its got a plan.
4806 2018-01-09 15:41:47 oil on the floor pranks are funny and all but who cleans the floor????

4829 2018-01-09 15:38:56 A reminder that new junior education minister Nadhim Zahawi earns almost £30,000 a *month* from a Kurdistan-based oil company. That's more than twice as much as Nadine Dorries is paid for her books.

4831 2018-01-09 15:38:50 Little concerned about rates and this sell off in the bond market this AM.  10 YR was just pushed above 2.52%.  Could mean higher rates in the near future as govt. spending, higher oil prices are contributing to increased risks of inflation.  We will see...
4832 2018-01-09 15:38:45 Why df it cost $72.34 for a fucking oil change ? Bruh I don’t want this nice ass car no more!

4836 2018-01-09 15:38:39 Again, the industry is subsidized (welfare queens), safety regs revoked for maximum profits, & tax for clean-up $ revoked. Industry gets all the gain, taxpayers get risk & cost! What a sweetheart deal for oil companies! #Corrupt

Very frequent answer that I received “Because of my passion”.

I do respect their answer, but personally I do not understand why you cant elaborate that into more specific details.

we need a vehicle for salty tasty fat 

kale will do

4853 2018-01-09 15:36:22 Yes. Good point. Something to do with Westminster allowing oil companies to lodge revenues and taxes offshore. That way Westminster denies the profits being attributed to Scotland. That is my basic understanding but happy to hear a better explanation.

4858 2018-01-09 15:35:49 Horrible, the removing of regulations on oil drilling. Also, allowing drilling in ocean on both coasts. All for FURTHER lining pockets of the rich 1%

For solar panels, they use lots of silicon. That's a threat to big oil. Corporations in American capitalism devolve into factionalism, not central planning.

5018 2018-01-09 15:16:13 1) put a few drops of eucalyptus or mint oil on a small plate and take a hot shower before you take meds, steam breaks up some of that.  2) if not well enough to shower, pour some boiling water and euc oil into a ceramic bowl, breathe it in for a few, then meds.

5062 2018-01-09 15:10:27 @TomSteyer Time to start listing rollbacks of regs and recently the expiration of the tax to clean up oil spills as well as remove safety regs. Our environment is being attacked by Zinke.
5063 2018-01-09 15:10:25 IF Saskatchewan businesses are suffering it is because of the out of control spending of Brad Wall. He thought the oil boom would last forever because ..well..because he's a moron. Repeating a lie doesn't make it the less a lie Andy, there are no tax hikes!

5135 2018-01-09 15:03:31 As a lover of coconut oil for years glad that there is no evidence to give up. I use it for cooking and for making hand cream and gardener's hand scrub..
5136 2018-01-09 15:03:30 When I get my oil changed I’m always afraid they’re gonna find SOMETHING else wrong
5137 2018-01-09 15:03:26 あ、まだ始まったばかりか。えらい！
5138 2018-01-09 15:03:20 Hahahaha! We don't need oil and coal!? You have no idea what you are talking about.
5139 2018-01-09 15:03:18 @KendallRaeOnYT did you hear about the lady who was using an essential oil diffuser and it caused her cat to get sick? Apparently the oils are very toxic to pets :( keep your babies safe 
5140 2018-01-09 15:03:18 Yes, the global battle for dominance and oil between the US and Russia created these monsters.
5141 2018-01-09 15:03:12 Agree with you about Phil 
The moment I saw him I thought that he was a snake oil salesmen

5144 2018-01-09 15:02:34 It's not like Scotland isn't already providing pretty much all the UK's Oil (and lots of energy in general)

Try fracking England & Wales, INEOS.
I'm sure they'll be overjoyed at doing their bit for Queen and country, providing the fuel of the nation...

5154 2018-01-09 15:01:31 Oil companies abandoned these tanks and should have paid for cleanup long ago
5155 2018-01-09 15:01:16 $310 on oil changes for my car n truck. Smh now ima eat air for lunch
5156 2018-01-09 15:01:16 Another thing to consider.Recently, the Kochs,Putin and Saudis agreed to cut oil production raising oil future prices. A clever way to hide $ laundering, in the market controlled by the Kochs.

5167 2018-01-09 15:00:35  surely yo aren’t that daft - “give us all the UK oil, a pop share of the rest of your (UK) assets but stuff out share of the debt, you keep that” that’ll work

5175 2018-01-09 15:00:01 I think she was peddling snake oil at the GG to a captive audience and they bought it all. Her friend Weinstein wasn't even mentioned the next day. All the talk was O 4 prez. She changed the whole dialogue.
5176 2018-01-09 14:59:46 It's not like Scotland is slacking in providing its fair share of OIL & Gas (energy in general) in the UK.

Just F' off Ineos.
Go frack England and Wales.
They'll love doing their bit for the UK.
5177 2018-01-09 14:59:39 The only Gov. to veto CBD oil, which helps those with intractable seizures, took away respite care funding for those of us who have children with autism and other developmental disabilities, why drag your feet on repealing the grocery sales tax? With you there's no hope.
5178 2018-01-09 14:59:37 Yeah..."Oprah, snake oil salesman"?  Trump University, Trump steaks, Trump wine, Trump "Made in the USA" all = BOGUS BS.

5182 2018-01-09 14:58:59 Get an oil change they said, it’ll be easy they said.
5183 2018-01-09 14:58:59 1/2..Some of our members have lost huge sums of money on Soya contracting, those who are successful have contracted a few large commercial farmers. The best model is a triangular model with say AgriBank or ZB or any bank for that matter, an oil expressor and a farmer.
5184 2018-01-09 14:58:55 maybe an oil diffuser! i just got one and changed my entire life i use it all the time
5185 2018-01-09 14:58:50 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other
5186 2018-01-09 14:58:49 Yes, effects can be seen when applied on feet as there are no oil glands there.

5200 2018-01-09 14:57:23 My car just reminded me that it needs its $80 oil change 
5201 2018-01-09 14:57:21 I guess that means they are safe from fracking, and oil drilling?
5202 2018-01-09 14:57:10 AB large oil and gas emitters carbon tax money collected on emmisons gets kept in a separate “tech fund” for them to use to spend on “innovation”. So they’re dollars are going where regular peoples carbon tax money is.

5205 2018-01-09 14:57:01 Ok, I’ll give it a try. How about as much as the oil companies can charge.
5206 2018-01-09 14:57:00 It would be a much different world if Africa had the oil everyone so coveted. 

Instead, they always get the short end of the stick.

5231 2018-01-09 14:54:57 I did a few things, it really all stems from the diet changes, however there are a few things I'd recommend. Find a good magnesium supplement, essential oil diffuser with mint oil and lavender oil, very soothing too.

5243 2018-01-09 14:53:55 There is a big opportunity for farmers. Contract farming would be ideal but not sure if it is viable for oil expressers because importing Soya may be cheaper.

5246 2018-01-09 14:53:42 Does making it a park mean that his mates can drill for oil there?
5247 2018-01-09 14:53:37 Ironically climate change denialism is a scam perpetrated by oil companies, like how they payed off a scientist to say lead was safe in the 60s.

Climate change has over 100 years of verified data from scientists all over the planet.

5261 2018-01-09 14:52:34 I agree with you to a point.  Oil companies do need to put money aside for cleanup.  In the past it was cheaper to pay surface rent than to cough up the lump sum for reclamation. The well then remained as an asset (dubiously).This was a ridiculous policy.  
Please see next note.

5264 2018-01-09 14:51:38 it's hard to decipher your tweet without punctuation, but what's "terrible" is the Obama admin's underestimation of the oil flow from the BP well. I'm not opposed to drilling; I think it should be regulated, however, to prevent more BP disasters.

5282 2018-01-09 14:49:21 Idiocy. If he never tweeted, I'd still be concerned about DACA, North Korea, offshore oil drilling, lapse of the financial and environmental rules put in place after previous disasters.

5286 2018-01-09 14:48:53 Bullshit, when oil prices went down, they claimed they had locked in at a high prices. I see gas in NJ go from $4 to below $2 but it kept going up in Jamaica.

5289 2018-01-09 14:48:29 @KamalChomani the real question is who should handle the oil in  #Kurdistan & 2 whom shall the money b spent on

The answer 2 that question is ALLWAYS #KRG & the Kurdistanians

If we have a bad #KRG let's work 2 change that, let's work 4 reforms but don't give it 2 Baghdad

5291 2018-01-09 14:48:19 As PIB is so important to our growth in oil sector and a value to the economy, This is why the 8th Senate passed the PIGB earlier 2017 as to end fuel scarcities in Nigeria.

It's most certain that this year all other sections of the bill will got passed.
5292 2018-01-09 14:48:10 USA has been a democracy since the times of George Washington. Flawed but a democracy nevertheless.  Arabic countries like Iraq never were. I get oil was the main reason but still calling them a democracy is a stretch.

5323 2018-01-09 14:45:17 Yes, they had mathmeticians/accountants on staff keeping track of temp and oil usage. Can you imagine that today ? That's service

5365 2018-01-09 14:40:45 PSA: it is raining for the first time in a while! Do NOT speed going to your destination today. The roads will be slick with oil being washed off the roads and the obvious puddles of water. It’s not worth risking your life and others. #DriveSafe
5366 2018-01-09 14:40:42 Who cares what this bloated old racist did at a football game? He is ruining the country with tax scams, deregulation, giving away land to oil corporations, seating unqualified judges to life time posting and destroying democracy.. stop with the stunt news.
5367 2018-01-09 14:40:35 EPA = environmental protection agency. Pruitt is from my state where they are so entrenched with the energy companies that our lawmakers allow them to cause almost daily earthquakes. They also tax oil companies so little that we can't afford to educate our children.

5406 2018-01-09 14:36:30 Less dependence on oil from countries that hate us is a really good thing.  It denies them the funds they use to conduct operations against US.
5407 2018-01-09 14:36:28 Cant be hopeful. Has to be sure rocketman doesnt hit his button. Blockade the oil instead. Something offshore.
5408 2018-01-09 14:36:26 I really need to go get an oil change but I do not feel like leaving the house.
5409 2018-01-09 14:36:26 The increase in the reserve has nothing to do with ban of items. The rising crude oil price ($68/barrel) in the international market has pushed our reserve to $40.4 billion. Even the Central Bank of Nigeria admitted to that. So what are you saying?

5518 2018-01-09 14:25:41 I think the credit rating is largely going down because of our dependence on an oil resource that isn't that much wanted internationally. Our assets plummeted under Klein who let the HTF die, and sold off assets to balance the current account. During boom times.

5530 2018-01-09 14:24:15 The USD-KES rate's been mostly stable in 2017. Crude prices, however, have been rising. Up 23% last year for Brent, and we're now approaching  $ 70/bbl. If that trend keeps up in 2018, we'll close 2018 with oil > $ 80/bbl. If the USD-KES weakens, that amplifies the hit.

5568 2018-01-09 14:20:19 I wouldn't bother with the oil rigs.
5569 2018-01-09 14:20:14 Never cook with butter. What oil is healthiest? Extra virgin olive oil! It contains monounsaturated fat and helps keep cholesterol down!
5570 2018-01-09 14:20:12 It wasn't a sub at all e was a prayer
5571 2018-01-09 14:20:11 No oils heated to very high temps are great. It appears that olive oil among others produce less of the harmful chemicals when heated. And for the compounds which they produce they appear to be less harmful.

5697 2018-01-09 14:04:22 Is comprehension a problem? I have maintained that oil prices affect non-oil GDP. If oil prices go up, non-oil GDP will rise.

5712 2018-01-09 14:02:24 Ivor - what a crock of utter drivel. Unless of course, you're referring to the 'in danger' oil reserves which turned out to also be a crock of...drivel! Which, you know, we're heavily relied upon for....
5713 2018-01-09 14:02:11 also I put coconut oil on my skin for the first time and I think you can smell it pretty well... I feel like the woman next to me on the train doesn't particularly like it. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
5714 2018-01-09 14:01:59 Had a dream the oil in my pen dripped out... what a nightmare 
5715 2018-01-09 14:01:51 Sounds like the detritus caught up in the oil, damaged his transmission. And yeah. Sounds like it should be done every year or so.

5735 2018-01-09 13:59:06 Actually, that argument has been made by many pro oil people when arguing with anti oil/pipeline people. Can't have it both ways brah!
5736 2018-01-09 13:58:48 One of cuts to save money was, CONGRESS cut money for clean up (environmental) and put in the part were the Oil companies no longer had to do clean ups. They said it was to much of a burden on the Company. Well now are we are paying for it, in more then one way!

5746 2018-01-09 13:57:51 Dropped the oil spill tax, I guess that means the oil companies are not going to spill anymore
5747 2018-01-09 13:57:42 Today is a big day for oil. We actually almost ticked my 62.60 level yesterday and reversed. Have been talking about that level for several weeks. Would be watching XLE here today in relation to oil. Ideally oil pops back to that level while XLE starts to roll over
5748 2018-01-09 13:57:40 Ran out of oil yesterday so my house is like a freezer. I can't be dealing with this.
5749 2018-01-09 13:57:35 Listen to yourself sir. The inverse relationship between oil GDP and non-oil GDP doesn’t matter. Yet you end up quoting how GDP crashed with oil prices.

Have a nice day sir.

5898 2018-01-09 13:39:01 You want to compare oil selling at well above $100 with when oil sold at $37 and the impact it will have on the oil and non oil economy? Is this actually a joke?

5907 2018-01-09 13:37:51 She actively promoted Dr. Phil and Dr. Oz, both of whom are snake oil salesmen. So, no. Oprah will not going to bring back trust or dignity to government in my opinion
5908 2018-01-09 13:37:43 But yet the GOP put it in their tax bill to stop funding in case of accidents on these oil rigs for clean up millions of dollars and open up the United States coastline for major disasters people you really need to read this tax scam
5909 2018-01-09 13:37:36 Same.  I have to put coconut or jojoba oil in my bath water to help stay moisturuzed.
5910 2018-01-09 13:37:30 Further evidence of overheating and the obsession across the board of exceeding the mania of 2007. Overreliance on FDI & cheap credit rather than sensible 50% cut oil & gas licences. Meanwhile, CMBS iceberg hidden in plain sight. #eductionglobal .
5911 2018-01-09 13:37:26 Oil prices trended downwards in Q4? This same chart I am looking at? Please show where oil prices trending downwards and show at what point it was that oil prices went below $103 in Q4.

At Oct, it was $112, Nov, $102 and needed the year at $111
5912 2018-01-09 13:37:24 And we're the claims in dollars or naira? Because that would make a big difference given the movement in value of dollar over that time span. Besides, one can never discount fraud from oil marketers' claims

5924 2018-01-09 13:36:04 I guess there is no oil there
5925 2018-01-09 13:36:03 You voted to take away healthcare from millions of Americans and increase premiums and access to care for others. Drilling for oil in Alaska is a disaster. How is this a brighter future? Alaska surely deserves better.

6036 2018-01-09 13:24:06 Research isn't needed to know that nobody wants oil drilling rigs off their coast. Plus, your mentality is backwards. We need NEW industries to bring us forward, not old, tired, oil. We're well aware our economy is based on fossil fuels, we want to transition off it, nt increase.

6129 2018-01-09 13:11:34 I live in FL,  and I can testify to the catastrophic economic effects that an oil spill can have on a coast line state.  It was horrible,  it took us years,  and years and years to recover,  and that is not to mention our precious environment and wildlife. 1/

6236 2018-01-09 12:58:17 Coconut oil is not good for cooking due to strong flavour, Olive oil is no good for frying, deep or otherwise as it starts to burn at too low temperature, although it is okay for low heat cooking;  that leaves vegetable and/or corn oil as the best general option.

6282 2018-01-09 12:53:17 I search the oil there too? U will sell there too like u did with Kirkouk just for British petroleum ?

6288 2018-01-09 12:52:25 Exactly! There was mention in an early article quoting Reuters saying that she was carrying crude oil from Kharg Island, but she took on cargo in Asaluyeh, which is where South Pars condensates are exported from.
6289 2018-01-09 12:52:19 Omg  so Joseph didn’t know how my oil diffuser worked so while I was at work he dumped almost an entire oil in it and was wondering why it wasn’t very full  I’m done lmao
6290 2018-01-09 12:52:07 Okay, so your point, once again, is that the inverse relationship between non-oil GDP and oil GDP in 2013 does not matter because oil prices were high, right?

I am just trying to understand your argument.

In 2013, the contribution of the non oil sector to the GDP rose to about 14.56% boosted by huge money flowing from oil since there was enough money to be pumped into the non oil sector.

6383 2018-01-09 12:39:48 So it doesn’t matter than oil GDP contracted while non oil GDP was growing because of high oil prices. It was not a sign that the Nigerian economy was attempting to detach itself from oil at that point. 

That’s your point, am I correct?

6422 2018-01-09 12:35:00 @tomfriedman I was shocked at the tanker, Iranian oil, burning in route to S. Korea. What, our allies supporting Iran buying their oil? How friendly are our friends?
6423 2018-01-09 12:35:00 That line reducing concentrate is  I'm a Kiehl's fan through and through and that concentrate and the midnight recovery oil are my HG products. But, yes, totally inappropriate to tweet that. Good you called them out on it.

6427 2018-01-09 12:34:33 What's the oil price now? How much has it risen in the last couple of years? How much revenue has it generated for uk since discovery? Given your claims these are relevant factors. I'm not using it as an argument. Oil exits, deal with it.
6428 2018-01-09 12:34:23 Use honey and coconut oil instead of a eye cream.

6431 2018-01-09 12:34:17 Are you aware that oil GDP contracted in 2013 while non-oil GDP expanded within the same period? Don’t you think that tells a whole lot of story about an economy that was actually detaching itself from the influence of oil?

6537 2018-01-09 12:18:01 But did oil prices dip in 2013? The money coming in from oil was enough to keep the non oil economy going. The average price of crude oil in 2013 was $91.

If oil prices dropped to $37 non-oil GDP will fall

6995 2018-01-09 11:08:42 IMO I don't think renewable energy will be the future. But for sure oil won't either. One day, someone will discover a better source of energy production. Whether by chance or not, there is never one answer (or two)...

7000 2018-01-09 11:07:36 Oil price hike starts, next month electric bill and everything follows. Ayan na ang TRAIN tatamaan na ang mga juan, at least bumaba naman daw income tax #braceourselves more high prices

7002 2018-01-09 11:07:30 I think Williams advocates "flexible price-level targeting" which would add an unemployment gap term that offsets the effect of oil prices in that circumstance. I also suspect he would advocate using core inflation in the rule which would dramatically reduce the problem.

7012 2018-01-09 11:06:26 @nikdpik Hey Nik, what do you think about the off shore drilling? At the same time, DT cut the tax on oil companies for money to clean up spills. It seems very swampy to me. The coastal governors are against it too. The corporations and special interests are having a field day.
7013 2018-01-09 11:06:12 Axe oil and tiger balm

7015 2018-01-09 11:05:45 Get your facts together. What terrorists did @BarackObama sympathize with? Also @realDonaldTrump is friends with the #SaudiArabia regime. Beheadings and no #TravelBan . Saudi oil money funds terrorists like #ISIS .
7016 2018-01-09 11:05:19 Republicans and trump showed their true colors, SELF INTEREST, when they proposed to open the pristine waters of our country for oil drilling! Even the most impoverished countries in the world will not permit drilling in their waters. TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE.

7082 2018-01-09 10:53:28 Needless to say. But let's not pretend that our non-oil GDP as it stands can offset major oil GDP contraction. It can't. And that's my point.
7083 2018-01-09 10:53:06 You demolished the funds for dealing with oil spills and now we’re having the biggest national disaster that we’ve ever had due to an oil rig on fire ready to explode if not already exploded in the middle of the ocean. Are you worried about that?

7433 2018-01-09 09:43:48 The less than 1% growth you are seeing is as a result of increase in crude prices.Non - oil GDP is still negative.If you know a little bit of macro economics you will understand the implication of this.Try harder.

7436 2018-01-09 09:43:22 Yes. The difference between "safe to eat" and "stuff you actually still WANT to eat" is big. No matter what you do, some little chemical reactions in a complex organic product will eventually change the taste. Hell...wait long enough and it will turn into precursor crude oil. ;)

7485 2018-01-09 09:32:37 I'm not sure everyone understands what is meant by abolish a dept.  They don't mean end the programs.  The DOE was created by Carter as a response to the oil crisis. Those fears are not reality anymore.  It's various programs could be folded into other agencies and save money.
7486 2018-01-09 09:32:15 Once again, oil is only 10% of GDP, how's 10% the main driver I wonder.

7545 2018-01-09 09:17:33 Great times for oil traders as U.S. oil prices hit their highest since 2015 early on Tuesday as speculators bet on further price rises amid OPEC-led production cuts and a dip in American drilling activity. The peak might be short-living though, experts say.
7546 2018-01-09 09:17:19 And to expand on that, in order to have closed borders we would have to be an entirely self-sufficient Nation. No imports from other countries.

7559 2018-01-09 09:14:52 Oh, not aware of that. I think Australia is last on Putin’s list, but he’s moving agressively into Middle East & Africa to obtain oil, then he wants to sell that oil to Europe.

7568 2018-01-09 09:12:26 You didn’t care about the Alaskan coastline when you voted for taxscam-which also gave tax break to oil companies by letting tax lapse that went to oil cleanup-and will you fight Trumps undoing safety regs on oil?   Actions speak louder...taxvote #wedontbelieveyou
7569 2018-01-09 09:12:26 Jiayous ( literally meaning is add oil but we mean like “you can do it” )
7570 2018-01-09 09:12:22 I agree with your theory of delusion. What I don’t see is why fission (much more expensive, slower to build, long-term costs & hazards) is better than subsidizing a continued roll-out of wind and solar (i.e. taking existing subsidies from oil & gas exploration)...
7571 2018-01-09 09:12:01 Possibly slightly unfair on Lidington: there are very many committed environmentalists who have a "past" in the oil/coal industries.

Those billions of people still need oil & coal for the time & for years.
7642 2018-01-09 08:56:16 if not for sheer luck of increase in the price of crude oil in the international market and peace of Niger Delta, what conscious intelligent effort did your government make to achieve and sustain this?

7726 2018-01-09 08:35:00 ever try a pea mash on toast? Cook frozen peas, garlic, parsley (fresh or dried, whichever you have on hand) in pan until tender. Add lemon juice, salt, pepper, chili flakes, olive oil (& chives, if you like) then mash together till you get a somewhat spreadable consistency.

7865 2018-01-09 08:02:15 Well he didn't really make a point to refute per se, so I can see why she criticized the apparent absence of research.
Did he mean we need to stop fracking? Make more regulations on it? Develop better tech?
What are implications of the US reducing fracking & oil independence?
7866 2018-01-09 08:02:15 Income tax forms a very small part of what we pay. GST as a indirect tax is being paid even by the poorest and forms the bigger chunk. Also we are paying three times the cost of oil products... exploitative.
Besides we also pay for lower level corruption.

7930 2018-01-09 07:49:54 Yup! Use whatever you have in your cupboard (even just olive oil, salt and pepper will work). I did soy sauce, garlic, ginger with black pepper and dried herbs. Stuck a fork in them a few times too, to absorb better.
7931 2018-01-09 07:49:52 #BBCBreakfast Maybe you should talk about the flash point on olive and Coconut Oil. They are much lower than traditional oils.

8136 2018-01-09 07:12:57 @NTAGMN Data is critical.  How much personnel do we need to turn the oil narrative around?  How much of them do we currently have?  Our universities and polytechnics churn out graduates every year.  What skills set do these people have?
8137 2018-01-09 07:12:41 Is #data the new #oil? Is #Renewable #Energy the next frontier? Are these just #catchphrases? We live in times of rapid changes - #Nokia collapsed in two years, from being the global mobile handset leader to literally selling out at salvage value.

8152 2018-01-09 07:10:35 It’s a real white trash meal, but I absolutely love fried leftover spaghetti with just a hint of olive oil and butter. Don’t want to know the calories, but it was amazing. Homemade meatballs and semi-homemade sauce, too.

It's a good thing to be building a squad that is improving and evolving on a budget, some fans have to accept we do not have an eccentric oil billionaire owner.
8178 2018-01-09 07:05:49 @NTAGMN Why can’t the most serious marketers pool their resources to build refineries whether modular or conventional if they are truly patriotic and want Nigeria out of this perennially sad oil narrative?
8179 2018-01-09 07:05:42 lol either way, your question should've suggested something more outrageous...like asparagus or coconut oil

8214 2018-01-09 06:58:13 I usually mix sliced ginger, white vinegar, a bit of sriracha and worchesterhire sauce for something similar.

8215 2018-01-09 06:58:07 @NTAGMN  I do not care if the crude oil is refined in Aboh Ihiteowerri, what should bother me is if the refined product is of use grade, if the equipment(which should be appropriate technologies that we can fabricate and fix locally)?

8259 2018-01-09 06:50:25 260,000 tonnes of oil has been spilt after an Iranian tanker collided with a Chinese freight. 

31 people are missing.

This oil spill is the largest since 1991 and it has the potential to DEVASTATE the environment. 

@Lionheart0075
8260 2018-01-09 06:50:24 The reference to 'crystal clear" is that possibly the CF Crystal which just crashed into the Iranian ship? All 21 on the Crystal (Chinese) were rescued, none on the Iranian have been, presumed to have been on way to NK to deliver oil? Just a thought.
8261 2018-01-09 06:50:15 @MSNBC Seriously, could this administration be any more obvious? Now they've allowed the fund for oil spills to die? So wtf  happens the next time these careless oil companies screw up and we have another major oil spill? Guess they'll just find a way to screw taxpayers. Again...

8297 2018-01-09 06:44:17 @NTAGMN This debate shouldn’t be complicated. It’s either we are a capitalist economy or not. We are currently importing refined oil in dollars and with the current exchange rate in Nigeria, fixing the price of fuel will lead to shortage of the product and hardship for Nigerians.

8301 2018-01-09 06:43:54 Your also working to open our beautiful coastal areas to off shore drilling.  Trump has lessened safety regulations on drilling companies & dropped the tax on oil companies that would have funded the cleanup of future oil spills.  You will not be re-elected.  You are corrupt!

8322 2018-01-09 06:40:06 There are no sebaceous glands so it can be a safer place to apply oils on children. I think it would absorb more slowly for adults, plus feet can get naturally sweaty (oil vs water) but I only use this on the kids when they are laying down. IDK. I think it helps.

8337 2018-01-09 06:36:06 When I say we are the architect of our own problem.

We are a sick people: earlier we accept the better

8406 2018-01-09 06:25:18 but fr if you’re looking for stuff to try, I suggest using coconut oil as a moisturizer at night (doesn’t clog pores & makes my skin SO soft) & I was skeptical on whether taking biotin actually worked or not, but after I started it I started getting tons of compliments on my skin
8407 2018-01-09 06:25:05 Couldn't have said it better. Oh wait, I did.
    No rain in 4 and a half months, all the oil deposited on the roads is now lifted out of the blacktop by the water and floating on street surfaces. Drive carefully, you are gliding along on oil.
8408 2018-01-09 06:24:58 My fav essential oil so far is sweet orange bc its an antidepressant and is helping me at night when im home alone and thats when i tend to get very sad and cant get out of it. Its helping tonight and im amazed!

That's the #problem #African #youth face that we'd rather take our intellect to other countries outside Africa

8413 2018-01-09 06:24:14 Wouldn’t it be weird if like when you die & go to Heaven instead of riding a dinosaur God IS a dinosaur! Like a T-Rex that could totally speak your language & He or She really hates modern humans now bc we use oil... That would be a total bummer! #Death #God #Dinosaurs 
8414 2018-01-09 06:24:10 winter's been so harsh on my skin lately, i would actually happily bathe myself in shea butter & coconut oil at this point.

These geniuses predicted TOTAL disaster on 200 million gals spilled but idiots didnt know oil can survive in salt water Just look at Santa Barbara's Coal Oil Pt

8417 2018-01-09 06:23:58 The other way to enjoy it is steam potatoes in it too...Separately in a kadhai add some oil and burn red chilli and onions ..Mash all of them together and put salt.

8422 2018-01-09 06:23:34 An Iranian oil tanker ship collided with a Chinese ship in the China sea it's been burning for 3 days & is ready 2 explode. It was carrying 150,000 tons of condensate oil which is lighter than crude oil but more deadly to the environment. We must work harder to move away from oil

8434 2018-01-09 06:22:15 Morning all. @bbc5live breakfast up and running - talking about smacking, fear of flying, VAR, and cannabis oil.
8435 2018-01-09 06:22:05 @bbcbreakfast If you cook rice with coconut oil then let it cool fully and reheat before using, it cuts carb content by 2/3. The coconut oil changes the molecular composition of the rice carb meaning the body can't absorb it.. So cook your rice in advance & put it in the fridge.
8436 2018-01-09 06:21:40 It's been floated as a hypothesis. I think there are probably/possibly hints of drug use in the OT. Heard a podcast a few years back speculating that Moses was using hash oil when he communed with Yahweh.

8547 2018-01-09 06:10:59 For Trump's rich oil friends, Trump is going to allowing drilling of oil off both coasts, he has taken safety precautions off drilling and he eliminated the emergency funds for oil spills

8558 2018-01-09 06:09:54 Much is said about them fighting for our freedom but really they fight for oil & other people's freedoms. We already have freedoms. I wish they fought for our freedoms here like they do overseas but our govt isn't set up that way.
8559 2018-01-09 06:09:49 Trump administration has let the tax on oil drilling that funds emergency clean up of oil spills lapse, he has eliminated regulations on safety of oil drilling put in place after Deepwater Horizon, and he wants to put dirty oil rigs along all coasts--Kochs must be delighted

8566 2018-01-09 06:08:08 A girl mechanic changed the oil in my car at autobacs. I'm pretty sure she used to work at the gasstation I frequent. She's good, fast and doesn't reek of cigarette smoke.

8575 2018-01-09 06:07:21 I use it as well
Oil industry, pipelines, valves for oil, fire systems, you name it. 
Accurate fluid dynamics predictions in pipes and valves help with better designs and 
materials. 
When some of these systems are 1000 meters under an offshore rig on the seabed,
Very important.
8576 2018-01-09 06:07:16 Lol...you and ajax water and oil.
8577 2018-01-09 06:07:11 now that I've washed my face with oil twice, bought new laundry detergent, and taken a vitamin and a supplement
I feel like I can do ~anything~
8578 2018-01-09 06:07:01 PMB have little or no choice than to subsidize, a further price increase will put the economy in more danger, inflation will skyrocket. PMS is a commodity with high multiplier effect. Unfortunately corruption in customs is still massive, they collect bribe from oil smugglers.
8579 2018-01-09 06:06:51 BTW we need to keep very close track of that oil tanker in the South China Sea because that’s what’s going to happen here as sure as shit. Not if, but when.
8580 2018-01-09 06:05:53 OOORRR!! Cut a lime apply olive oil and salt rub that shit on your face squeeze the lime while you’re doing it and let it dry and then sleep in it

$62.15
8583 2018-01-09 06:05:15 Hey... We're damn good at that too!
We'll even let a Canadian Company come in and do that for 3 paid speeches by a corrupt politician...
Then they can ship their oil to Texas for refining, for shipment to Europe...
8584 2018-01-09 06:05:03 It would be beautiful but for the oil pipeline,
8585 2018-01-09 06:04:56 It's bean cake. Made from peeled beans formed into a ball and deep fried in oil. It goes well with bread.
8586 2018-01-09 06:04:51 HOW DANGEROUS DONALD JACKASS TRUMP IS TO THE WORLD HAS JUST BECOME ABUNDENLY CLEAR TODAY. REGARDING ROLLING BACK REGULATIONS ON OIL N GAS. THIS DEMON IS SINGLE HANDEDLY DESTROYING THE ENVIRONMENT. U WILL HEAR ABOUT THIS OIL SPILL FOR YEARS TO COME. STUPID IS AS STUPID DOES!

8588 2018-01-09 06:04:35 They will be drilling for oil
8589 2018-01-09 06:04:09 When you retread a truck tyre you save 20 ltrs. of crude oil. Last year you helped us to save about 3 Millions ltrs. of crude oil for the nation. RETREADING IS RECYCLING..Ultimately Saving a Cost!!
8590 2018-01-09 06:04:06 Eh it seems pretty suspicious that there's an oil tanker fire off of China right after we hear about them selling oil illegally to North Korea @maddow
8591 2018-01-09 06:03:58 Fr fr. Still got that lying cheating bitch coconut oil.
8592 2018-01-09 06:03:57 Where do you live? You can get the oil online at least that’s how I get mine. I’ve got a prescription for medical weed. Painkillers don’t work anymore & everyone’s recommending I try this route. See how it goes fingers crossed

8633 2018-01-09 05:58:53 @maddow I'm really upset that you guys are not releasing videos from the show that I think are the most important. Tonight, it's the oil tanker on fire and the fact that the tax bill just cut off the funding for clean ups of oil spills! Release these too!
8634 2018-01-09 05:58:42 Truth is whoever will genuinely create a radical change in how things are done especially in the Oil and Gas sector will NOT seek a second term in office.

The odds are all stacked against positive reforms in this country.
8635 2018-01-09 05:58:28 Man how many jobs get filled by swamp man?  How many safety regulations that were put in place because of accidents that already happened get removed, cancel the funding for Oil spills the Oil companies had to pay so tax payers can now cover cost. More Great America shit birds.
8636 2018-01-09 05:58:28 Republicans did not renew in their #taxscam a 9 cent a barrel tax on oil. The tax was paid by oil corporations to fund emergency response to oil spills. Dennis Ross represents Florida and knows full well the billions of damages caused in Florida by a spill in the Gulf of
8637 2018-01-09 05:58:01 @realDonaldTrump #MSNBC Pollution controls eliminated, hazardous Cancer causing chemicals no longer restricted, public lands opened for mining, oil drilling allowed off every coast, no funds for  oil spills.

8646 2018-01-09 05:57:16 And in 10 months or less Mother Earth will have it cleaned up with no lasting harm or damage just like the BP spill in the Gulf that was supposed to take 10 years to get cleaned up. Earth has had to deal w/oil spills long b4 our drilling. #DaftBat

8649 2018-01-09 05:56:33 #ExxonKnew.  You oil companies just got Trump to kill the 9 cents per barrel for the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund (the main way to pay for oil spills) to 0 & got all safety regulations removed on ocean drilling.  We will fight you with our last breath. You are evil.

8656 2018-01-09 05:55:56 Disturbing segment on this tonight. Truly despicable how republicans are bought by the oil industry. No good can come of this.
8657 2018-01-09 05:55:47 try a combination of orajel & clove oil or dried leaves. it tastes horrible but it does work.
8658 2018-01-09 05:55:36 Oh, heck. It’s complicated but it is certainly not the engineers’ fault.  I would not say that the engineers that work oil other fields are responsible for the public perception triumphs and failures.

8665 2018-01-09 05:53:41 The Feds discover more then 70lbs of coke at a Philly Port. It’s name is Vito and it was ordering an Italian hoagie with oil and had plans to get Eagles playoff tickets.
8666 2018-01-09 05:53:27 I have to wake up early and get an oil change 
8667 2018-01-09 05:53:21 put it in some rice with some coconut oil
8668 2018-01-09 05:53:17 So your option is to cut off oil...OK...get off twitter oil then...
8669 2018-01-09 05:53:17 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
8670 2018-01-09 05:53:07 Yesss. Which type of oil though? And don’t I fry them in the end anyway?
8671 2018-01-09 05:53:07 Oil companies don't take responsibility for destroying our planet or for unleashing Cthulhu
8672 2018-01-09 05:53:05 I don't believe in all this hocus pocus, Mumbo-Jumbo... they just conned that babe of her N4500 for a useless bottle of oil. The man liked her because he liked her. If the oil really worked he would've given her the money she asked for.
8673 2018-01-09 05:52:57 The oil will either burn or sink, libtarded moron. Impacts on shorelines are temporary for every spill, mimicking the constant natural seepage that happens on the sea floor when we just let all that NATURAL oil go to waste. What's not natural are your giant bird blenders.
8674 2018-01-09 05:52:56 i was talking to someone about face washes and skincare and i told her i’m allergic to tea tree oil and she dead ass tried to argue with me about it
8675 2018-01-09 05:52:55 Forget your fearful conspiracy theories the Word of God says “Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.” Psalm 23:5 FEAR NOT #Yeshua
8676 2018-01-09 05:52:10 Loving Vincent is a technical marvel. Every scene has been made in oil paint. Plus it's got an amazing plot. Reminded me of Scanner Darkly where every scene was cel shaded.

8682 2018-01-09 05:51:14 You know better than to make that statement.  We've already covered this point.  Sun goes down, hopefully hydro, but often gas or coal or oil or diesel goes on.
8683 2018-01-09 05:51:12 “Your truth”? Only those who believe morality is subjective would buy that snake oil.  Oprah’s a loon!!!!

8686 2018-01-09 05:50:59 No rain in 4 and a half months, all the oil deposited on the roads is now lifted out of the blacktop by the water and floating on street surfaces. Please drive carefully, you are gliding along on oil.

8691 2018-01-09 05:50:25 with less oil justngo at a little lower temp. Flavor won’t be as good but you’ll still get decent coloring as they tenderiz
8692 2018-01-09 05:50:13 What's the basis for your assertion of 'catastrophic climate change'?
The last time there was TRULY catastrophic climate change was the last advance of the Wisconsin ice sheet which ended 10k years ago.  Coal plays a part in total emissions along with oil, gas, and agriculture.
8693 2018-01-09 05:50:12 This is #fakenews, CBS.  PresTrump never wanted to have coal be our nation’s top power source! Please correct your error!   We do need some coal production as carbon is needed for steel production.  Oil remains out msin source of power at this time
8694 2018-01-09 05:50:03 Change my oil bitch
8695 2018-01-09 05:49:57 Lmao, don't mind them.. The oil for get am danu danu

8698 2018-01-09 05:49:33 And there isn't a trace now is there. But stinking libtards sent trillions of dollars of American wealth to murderous islamist supremacists as if they were somehow better stewards of the environment. Anyone care to remember all the oil dumped into the oceans by Iran and Iraq?

8702 2018-01-09 05:49:11 NP if I hear of anything tho I’ll let you know I only know foaming cleansers are better for oily skin so you don’t strip the natural oils from your skin which cause you to produce excess oil
8703 2018-01-09 05:49:10 Cbd oil? Have to check out. Weed can't have, oh and doesn't work anyway, the traditional kind. Maybe,oil if we ever get it.
8704 2018-01-09 05:49:06 オイルだからってオイルツイートばかりな訳じゃないぞ。油ツイートもするよ。
8705 2018-01-09 05:48:50 Remember this. OPEC is begging the U.S. to join them. All the more reason to deny whites of what they want.  For you braindead who are embracing Islam you are flirting with Muslim disaster.  Oil is their #1 export.

8707 2018-01-09 05:48:19 Questions we’d love @SoonerPoll to ask: Is it fair for renewable energy to bear heavier tax burden than oil drillers? / Should Oklahoma tax policies be debated and decided in secret by the business insiders club, or in open meetings held by lawmakers and with public input? #okleg

8716 2018-01-09 05:46:39 Off shore oil spills happen every day in California, but are never reported. Now you care since Trump became President? Perhaps you should focus more on cannabis legalization as that's how the Exxon Valdez oil spill occurred. Stop sniffing your glue.
8717 2018-01-09 05:46:37 #TruthfullyTrish #cbd oil does NOT get you high! It’s used for pain management not mania management!
8718 2018-01-09 05:46:29 No dependency on foreign oil excellent move for the country think lady 
8719 2018-01-09 05:46:29 I still have my braid out in and I moisturized my hair last night and the night before with some coconut oil 
8720 2018-01-09 05:46:08 Utah helped elect Trump knowing he would drill off coastal areas, run oil piped through sacred land, pollute rivers, streams, air, water, all for profit and ignorance. Guess it's always different when it's your backyard.  What were they thinking?
8721 2018-01-09 05:45:58 The price of #Bitcoin should be up top along side Gold and Oil. #cryptocurrency #crypto #btc $btc #WSJ
8722 2018-01-09 05:45:38 So the GOP Disgusting Tax reform, They dropped the tax for oil companies had to pay just in case there is an oil spill accident, has been since the Exxon VD spill, over 500 billion a year, gone!  Now there is a china oil tanker burning off the coast of South Carolina...Great!
8723 2018-01-09 05:45:22 Why are you regurgitating libtarded talking points? How long did oil last in Alaska or the Gulf of Mexico after spills and leaks?  The answer is LESS THAN ONE YEAR in exchange for trillions of dollars of energy resources that otherwise just go to waste, oozing into oceans anyway!

8725 2018-01-09 05:45:00 If you honk at me .5 seconds after the light turns green I’m going to put my vehicle in park, adjust my seat, check my tire pressure, change my oil, return some emails, eat a snack, read a book, brush my teeth, nap, and build a Lego set
8726 2018-01-09 05:44:52 That moment when a really pretty girl walks into the elevator, and the smell of coconut oil fills the space.
8727 2018-01-09 05:44:51 Do citizens know that the oil spill clean up fund tax has been lifted? There is a million gallon oil Fire now in the China Sea.
8728 2018-01-09 05:44:50 EUR/USD is lower, now traded at 1.19700. JPY jumped higher this morning after BOJ started to trim bond buying. CRUDE OIL is higher again, now at 62.20 USD.

8731 2018-01-09 05:44:30 Brush some light oil?
8732 2018-01-09 05:44:25 I remember during PBO the media had oil spills on a continuous loop. The media is very bias. Our environment doesn't matter as much to folks under GOP rule. Why?
8733 2018-01-09 05:44:23 If you like green beans put those in a pan with a lil pit of oil and put balsamic on it with some onions and garlic and it’ll change your life I eat that alone or over rice

8745 2018-01-09 05:43:11 You better let them rest before they be gone for good  You tried wild growth oil yet?
8746 2018-01-09 05:43:11 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for a non-GMO diet, and put some moon dust essential oil in my diffuser.

8748 2018-01-09 05:42:40 At best, Bush used 9/11 to push a radical agenda clearly cooked up long before that day to reshape the Middle East, steal oil, increase our imperial hegemony and curtail our freedoms.
8749 2018-01-09 05:42:39 It takes time for your skin to adjust. You'll probably break out worse before you clear up. I mostly only use it (coconut oil) for eye makeup remover now instead of full face, but some like it.
8750 2018-01-09 05:42:38 Don’t smoke Marijuana while drilling for oil. No Jack Daniels for captains of tankers. Just a couple of suggestions
8751 2018-01-09 05:42:33 Not really. The oil pressure gauge never worked, after probing out all of the electical connections I was pretty sure the sensor was just borked. I bought a replacement which is now installed just to be sure.

Turns out it never worked because of operator error on install.

Oops.
8752 2018-01-09 05:42:27 Pls reduce petroleum & diesel prices if u not reduce the oil prices the 2019 election is difficult

8755 2018-01-09 05:41:56 I call BS. We have to call every month and have our bill fixed. Takes an hour each time. We’re going back to Verizon. The snake oil we got isn’t what we were promised.

8768 2018-01-09 05:39:03 I usually do cut half, film of oil on cast iron as you said but will try no steam next time! Grazie
8769 2018-01-09 05:38:53 Rachel's key points--Trump Admin:
1. Might let bIg burning tanker explode=3x bigger than Exon Valdez
2. Let Oil Spill Trust Fund tax expire last week
3. Trying to cut Safety Procedures meant to prevent spills 
4. Trying to open 47 offshore drilling leases--most of our coasts.
8770 2018-01-09 05:38:50 In '69,  100,000 barrels of oil "seeped" from Union's Platform A . Not sure I'd call it natural tho.
8771 2018-01-09 05:38:15 also, there is so much castor oil on my eyelashes right now that i can’t touch my face or it will get in my eyeballs. they WILL GROW AND BECOME BEAUTIFUL LADY GIRAFFE LASHES.

8773 2018-01-09 05:37:59 means oil producers are withholding their urge to sell oil.. haha
8774 2018-01-09 05:37:57 I'm a liberal, Venezuela started going bankrupted due to Maduro's corruption and mishandling of Venezuela's oil reserves.
8775 2018-01-09 05:37:46 บ่ฮู้คือกัน
8776 2018-01-09 05:37:31 Ah cool- read your article and thought it said loads of oil and high temp, so thought the steaming would be a workaround
8777 2018-01-09 05:37:30 B vitamins in general, but a good multi vitamin, fish oil tablet, and probiotics combination to start your day is effective. @GNCLiveWell sells Women's Active Multivitamins that are extended release, and offer a good boost of energy.
8778 2018-01-09 05:37:18 ARE YOU MAD ? THE FAMILY HE MET WAS A PRODUCT OF HIS ACTIONS. WHAT GOOD DOES BRINGING THEM OVER DO IF HE ALLOWS SBUYS OIL FROM & ALLOWS THE SAME PEOPLE INTO THE COUNTRY WHO THEY TRY TO ESCAPE FROM DUE TO HIM NOT MAINTAINING BOARDER VETTING FOR PEOPLE ENTER THE COUNTRY
8779 2018-01-09 05:37:14 You're a Luddite idiot. Oil has naturally been washing up on that shore for years, and a full study of the spill by USC determined that "long-term environmental effects of the spill seemed to be minimal," and so they were. Support offshore drilling, it's good for the economy.
8780 2018-01-09 05:37:10 It's Wild Argan oil.
8781 2018-01-09 05:37:08 I still have to pack, get my hair braided, get my nails done && get my oil changed!!! I should’ve took off tomorrow

8787 2018-01-09 05:35:32 Tea tree oil, coconut oil & epsom salt In ur bath  thank me later
8788 2018-01-09 05:35:29 100+million vs. 6.5 billion dollar--nuclear plant  vs. electrical plant---more energy--non-explosive--no waste product--9000+% less cost--30-employees  vs. 500+ employees 1-barrel of oil makes 150,000 gallons of gas not 28-U.S. gallons

8791 2018-01-09 05:34:59 Don’t forget, they also didn’t renew the oil spill tax in the tax cut bill, so you need to be prepared for little FED help if there is any spill in the future. #Trumpfuckery
8792 2018-01-09 05:34:39 From a hot air popper with Kerrygold butter or avacado oil. Microwave popcorn will actually kill you. Fight me on this, but keep it on twitter only please. I'm fragile.

8798 2018-01-09 05:33:46 Deja-vu from oil industry of 1920s: we'll see more and more mature shale oilfields and thus some companies like @Shell start to explore new shale opportunities from elsewhere. But do we see more aggressive resource nationalism years (and decades) to come?
8799 2018-01-09 05:33:33 don't need our oil. What parts of this ate so hard for you to understand? The market for our product fell through when low prices for other sources made it impractical. BEFORE the NDP.

8823 2018-01-09 05:30:12 Did not work for me! I felt like a greasy little greaseball by about 3 PM the day after I oil cleansed in the evening. And my skin’s not usually oily. (Now I feel as though I can go to bed having been productive on Twitter).
8824 2018-01-09 05:29:57 The Oil I received for testing purposes has earned a permanent spot in my rotation. As soon as I finish my bottle of shampoo and conditioner, I’ll be getting the new Elvive Oil! #ProofIn1Use, #ElviveRevive #LOrealElvive, #Complimentary, #Contest, @LOrealHair, and @InfluensterVox

8826 2018-01-09 05:29:48 I hope so but she is ripe to be savaged just like Moore. I fear she had said some things that will haunt her.
8827 2018-01-09 05:29:35 i love putting way too many drops of oil in my diffuser and sinking in my bed slowly losing conciousness while inhaling lemon and lavendar
8828 2018-01-09 05:29:26 She was the Senator from NY who had just been attacked in the largest terrorist attack in US History.   Big Pharma is behind interventionist policy now?  Who knew.  I always thought it was Big Oil

8831 2018-01-09 05:29:08 I'm not sure what you consider a lot of oil, but you can get away with just at hin coat on the bottom of a cast iron skillet if you want to sear them. Cut in half, cut-side-down.
8832 2018-01-09 05:28:39 大体合ってる
8833 2018-01-09 05:28:36 Well they don't think so. They don't think and function like you and I. Tell me, why Hitler did not invade any Muslim Country? Why Iraq, Iran were not attacked, especially for the OIL?
8834 2018-01-09 05:28:29 Coconut oil. Avocado oil. Castor oil. Cocoa butter. In that order.
8835 2018-01-09 05:28:20 Nah....Time to use our country’s resources to help its citizens. 
Global demand for oil is not going anywhere anytime soon. 
Either we drill or they drill.
8836 2018-01-09 05:28:19 1. Coming home to a made bed does amazing things

Unless we put him in the classification of Cult Leader and with such blind cult followers he has, it would fit.  The sad thing about a cult is that u don’t realize ur a mindless drone

Can’t let down their big oil donors!  Your party is morally bankrupt and you refused to stand up to them. Bye!

8847 2018-01-09 05:25:17 Never suggested oil is unhealthy-  oil = calories. usually Brussels cooked raw need a sig. amount of oil, thought maybe precooking helps
8848 2018-01-09 05:25:05 I think its the money what he and his fam has deposited in oil resources in Saudi. So he no trust evem with his employees.:)

8862 2018-01-09 05:22:23 I don't know what qualifies as low. But oil is not inherently unhealthy. Use olive oil or other low saturated fat high omega-3 oils I guess.
8863 2018-01-09 05:22:16 Price is too High is so bad in india oil price

8874 2018-01-09 05:20:56 Do you use an oil in your skincare routine? I noticed once I switched to an oil over regular moisturizer my oily skin decreased MAJORLY
8875 2018-01-09 05:20:50 So u wanted the devil to use u as enemy of progress . U don’t know the higher the oil price the better.
8876 2018-01-09 05:20:47 Ppl should be disgusted with the fact of someone being able to hoard a billion dollars through a capitalist system that exploits workers, bombs countries for oil and corporate exploitation. Instead we worship them and anoint them our rulers
8877 2018-01-09 05:20:29 But dollars, share, oil, bussinesses, economics, donations and fake humanright can be dull and shut down on the eyes n mouth.

8880 2018-01-09 05:20:12 Use of peat and algae/ powdered seaweed dispersed over sheen will allow oil to biodegrade safely with out affecting much the ecological balance of oceanic life, but let the biologist and scientist agree.
8881 2018-01-09 05:20:02 About only thing helping corn stay viable has been GOV-AG subsidies.
$Billions were spent/wasted on ethanol plants &w/oil prices where they're at~ethanol is unfeasible.
Live in dairy country~& milk prices ARE pathetic; & aren't subsidized to anywhere near the extent that corn is.

- Removed a 9 cent a barrel tax on oil specifically set aside to clean up oil spills.

9088 2018-01-09 04:55:33 "Brain man". Why can't "brain man" teach his kid 3rd grade math? Why did "brain man" build threatened kim jun un? Why did "brain man" spoil his kid. "Why did brain man decide to build more oil rigs, resulting in climate change" Why did "brain man" hired a crappy scientist?
9089 2018-01-09 04:55:30 Ok um so this is what we get for planning to get you cannabis oil ?????? hella rude

9091 2018-01-09 04:55:06 @djmastamynd Hope your $DO pain turns into gain. Oil, Energy, Resources...all look to be on for some return to favour. Due to: 'Cyclical Rotation' or 'what goes round comes round'? Take your pick 
9092 2018-01-09 04:54:49 Yes! I’ve been told to try out the Rosehip Oil and the hibiscus ultra lift eye cream. Heard they are both amazing! I’ve been using your Bamboo Firming Fluid and Neroli Eye Serum for a few months now and I lurrrrrve them! 
9093 2018-01-09 04:54:45 Senator:  In my 67 year life span, there have been very few serious oil spills.  Santa Barbara was one of them.  Better technology today insures even safer off shore drilling.  Worth the risk for our nation to be energy independent.  Jobs, Jobs, Jobs.  MAGA.  JM

9095 2018-01-09 04:54:38 I used tea tree oil on my nose piercing and never got an keloid, but I used it on the MASSIVE keloid I have from my industrial and it did absolutely NOTHING I literally might have to get it surgically removed
9096 2018-01-09 04:54:30 I hate having coconut oil in my hair .
9097 2018-01-09 04:54:24 and your "science" uses carbon dating. it dates 2samples of crude oil from the same well.. 1 is 50 years old. the other is 20,000+. (no carbon14). but same well. provable. repeatable. idiotic.
9098 2018-01-09 04:54:15 vitamin e oil is the best thing i’ve ever done for my skin
9099 2018-01-09 04:54:13 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails
9100 2018-01-09 04:54:11 Tea tree oil is what worked for me!!
9101 2018-01-09 04:54:08 chamomile teabag  compress and tea tree oil saved me from my industrial keloids being permanent
9102 2018-01-09 04:53:38 I wasn’t agreeing with point one because I’m not a climatologist. Which is why I trust the experts like Scientific America, NASA, et all versus politicians sponsored by oil companies.
9103 2018-01-09 04:53:37 am upset over Rep removing oil rig safety and funds for cleanup
9104 2018-01-09 04:53:08 Lost in all the "He's crazy" talk:
1. The Trump administration just today cancelled a 9 cent tax on every barrel of oil sold in the US which funded federal response to oil spill disasters (Exxon Valdez tax)
9105 2018-01-09 04:53:02 Plans for tonight: oil my hair, go through the ~200 photos I took at rehearsal, drink tea, fantasize about owning a strap-on

John D. Rockefeller was an American oil industry manager who was considered to be the wealthiest American of all time. His economic effect on the United States was that he revolutionized the petroleum industry.
9110 2018-01-09 04:51:37 Why are the Dems quiet on the offshore drilling rule changes?

9114 2018-01-09 04:50:34 Petro oil has left my family with no heat for two days.  Immediately after getting an automated oil delivery we lost heat.  The service dept  has been unreachable. Only contact has been sales department who has given up three different times block for service. Still no response!!
9115 2018-01-09 04:50:31 I respect your opinion but I have my reservations considering she brought us way too many snake oil salesmen. Just sayin. I will reserve judgement since 2018 appears next on the calendar.
9116 2018-01-09 04:50:24 I’m going to give coconut oil another try

add oil
u should keep warm too
9124 2018-01-09 04:48:34 The same message that they gave to Trudeau. In many cases China owns the company that is producing the Bitumen or "upgraded" Oil and they are pissed that they can't get it to Tidewater.
9125 2018-01-09 04:48:26 Nick Saben is a well oil machine
9126 2018-01-09 04:48:19 What influence currency? Gold reserved? Oil price? Who is the one who control this kind of thing? Is there's a so called fund manager managing the world currency?

9131 2018-01-09 04:47:34 Oil prices have steadily increased since Trump, Ross, and Tillerson visited KSA over the summer. Possibly a long-term deal was made, re: Vision 2030 and growing US fracking; a long-term transition.  Just an instinctual guess.
9132 2018-01-09 04:47:32 Thing is, we don't have to pay more. This is a scheme to sell oil to Putin...the Russian economy is based on Oil Prices...and the #OrangeDingleberry wants to feed into it.
9133 2018-01-09 04:47:17 Keep in mind that this is not about adding coconut oil on top of what you're already eating, it is about replacing some of your current cooking fats with coconut oil.
9134 2018-01-09 04:47:17 เมื่อไหร่นาอึนจะรู้ว่าพี่อยากเห็นหน้านาอึนมากกว่าอะไรทั้งหมด ฮึก
9135 2018-01-09 04:47:08 Less than a day later, Trump wants to order sanctions on Iran TV networks & don't rule out USAF knocking out satellites. If Iran thinks Turkey will come & help should US-UK attack, just look at Turkey selling oil to illegal Israel and having a embassy there in occupied Palestine.
9136 2018-01-09 04:46:57 However I use less salt and been using avocado oil which tastes milder.
9137 2018-01-09 04:46:56 got my lava lamp, essential oil diffuser, conspiracy theories documentary, and artemis. what more could a girl want?
9138 2018-01-09 04:46:52 Same story.  No heat for two days.  Lost heat immediately after getting an automated oil delivery. The delivery came from “Lewis” a contracted company.   Petro oil service department has been awful!!!

9140 2018-01-09 04:46:40 Mad I didn’t oil my scalp down before this sew in 
9141 2018-01-09 04:46:39 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats.
9142 2018-01-09 04:46:31 It's the Super Bowl all over again.
9143 2018-01-09 04:46:27 That's ridiculous. Why would you not listen to the guy who's actually played in the NFL? Just because you change your cars oil doesn't mean you're a professional  mechanic.  Stink is right you're not!
9144 2018-01-09 04:46:14 Mayonnaise is made of raw eggs and oil. We eat it all the time (unless you’re a Miracle Whip-loving troll).

So WHY is it not okay to eat cookie dough made with raw eggs?!? 
9145 2018-01-09 04:46:07 We are just going to have to take our government back from the hands of a traitorous man whose goal is to destroy it.   I feel sick to my stomach everytime he opens his mouth because I know it will be another lie or another evil act like drilling for oil in protected waters (1)
9146 2018-01-09 04:45:59 Cook With Coconut Oil
9147 2018-01-09 04:45:49 I am way excited for the kiwi strawberry idk why it just looks yummy  also I added some coconut oil since my skin has been so dry and oh my goodness 
9148 2018-01-09 04:45:45 And do you oil companies and these Congress people including Donald J Trump know the damage they are going to cause. Problem is they just don’t care, it’s all about instant gratification and money
9149 2018-01-09 04:45:43 Use rosehip oil and hyaluronic acid. I swear by it.

9152 2018-01-09 04:45:09 @CNNnewsroom Did Lemon just loose his mind? He repeated the question with such indignation, even though he asked it of the wrong guy! It’s like asking the oil company, that since they will get the permit to drill anyway, what’s the point of the protestors continuing? Huh?
9153 2018-01-09 04:45:04 โคตรหมา

9156 2018-01-09 04:44:30 You meant #TaxHorror.  Hope you Republicans will ante up out of your pockets to fund for future oil spills that you refunded with your #TaxHorror.
9157 2018-01-09 04:44:12 It is funny they start with expertise on oil and when they are exposed on their knowledge they resort to 'tradr'..though they do not trade or do not have the money to trade..This forge river is a kid from China who went from trolling to seeking alpha articles..from $5 to $10:)

9166 2018-01-09 04:42:46 AND the Trump administration wants to cut the 9 cent per barrel emergency relief fund that is set aside in case of another disaster like the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill.  Good time to be in the oil industry right?

9169 2018-01-09 04:42:06 Have u thought maybe him rejecting a new contract from Arsenal has nothing to do with the wages offered. Maybe he wants to win bigger trophies. Anyways like we both agree oil money no dey finish.

9197 2018-01-09 04:37:03 Not so much respect but sorrow for the people that have to live there. People were forced to move there in the USSR, and now the entire place is owned by an oil company that won’t let anyone leave easily.
9198 2018-01-09 04:36:45 U dey talk like say u no know how oil money be. Even if no be that exact amount, for him to reject £375k from us means he won't earn less then £400 for there

9213 2018-01-09 04:35:04 Entire towns owned by an oil company that is above the law, what you’re looking at is high grade capitalism at its finest.
9214 2018-01-09 04:35:03 Try a little coconut oil. Adds shine to everything!
9215 2018-01-09 04:34:59 ...and in Huntington Beach in 1990 (American Trader) and in San Francisco in 2007(Cisco Busan) and Santa Barbara in 2015 (Plain All American). No more oil drilling & spilling #defendourcoasts

9218 2018-01-09 04:34:42 I tried primer oil, I tried a damp sponge, I tried fix + and even a primer spray on a brush  Okay, I don't feel so bad exchanging it now. This is the second makeup item I bought recently that made me feel stupid. First was the bon bons palette! Cannot get a good look with it!

9220 2018-01-09 04:34:16 Try again mate the entire town is owned by an oil corporation, literally no business or building in that place isn’t owned by them, that is the epidemy of capitalism.
9221 2018-01-09 04:34:13 Gone to buy oil & polish to shine country 
9222 2018-01-09 04:33:58 But it will push others to demand for same amount or higher when negotiating their next contracts. Well oil money cannot finish so what am I even talking about.

9230 2018-01-09 04:32:50 i would NOT say this is for dry skin. unless you put some primer oil or argan oil in it. i’m oily as hell, but since it’s so thick, i dilute it with my primer and a damp sponge.
9231 2018-01-09 04:32:25 .@Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
9232 2018-01-09 04:32:24 life will always find a way......even if the butterfly effect has no real rhyme of reason other than a castor oil to the fate we make......

9245 2018-01-09 04:31:11 then trade for money i.e if you trade...why in the world are you involving yourself in any oil discussion:)
9246 2018-01-09 04:31:08 I was in Pensacola,Fl shortly after their oil spill . It was such mess ,loss of aquatic life and globs of oil washing up. Also loss of income and tourism.
9247 2018-01-09 04:31:00 Have you tried the cover fx natural finish foundation? It’s super good with nyx angel veil or the smash box primer oil

9259 2018-01-09 04:29:51 Not Globes related, but True Life: I have spent 4 days + a bottle of coconut oil trying to remove my lash extensions from December and I am not only not able to but I have removed the majority of my real lashes.
9260 2018-01-09 04:29:44 I just rolled with an oil blotting paper (for your face) and it burned beautifully 
9261 2018-01-09 04:29:28 Plus "good oil"
9262 2018-01-09 04:29:27 I have an oil diffuser my brother got me for Christmas and I love it 
9263 2018-01-09 04:29:22 There you go again, being against energy independence and remaining dependent upon foreign oil. Are you for, or against, America. You’re positions are very anti-American.
9264 2018-01-09 04:29:15 I use it to sautee veggies instead of oil!  I often add the chickpeas as well!
9265 2018-01-09 04:29:07 My parents commissioned a large oil painting of my dog and honestly same
9266 2018-01-09 04:29:07 Trump and the Retrumplicans don’t believe in human caused climate change and have given Big Oil Tax breaks, reduced or eliminated safety and environmental rules and will allow the tax payers to pick up the bill for the catastrophes that will follow. Vote the all OUT ASAP!
9267 2018-01-09 04:29:02 Keep checking that oil man
9268 2018-01-09 04:29:01 The last time I was rooting for a Georgia team in a big game they lost a lead in the fourth quarter. Hmmmm.
9269 2018-01-09 04:28:51 I would have cried. Try coconut oil or vitamin e serum near the base of your lashes
9270 2018-01-09 04:28:42 tbh I think cbd oil is really your friend here, it’s helped me a my stomach a lot in general! the brand you tried from me was charlottes web. food wise I like chicken broth w white rice.
9271 2018-01-09 04:28:24 ranger hurt his paws and now I have him wrapped up in a blankie w/ coconut oil on his feet while I fed him Mac and cheese with hot dogs that I made specifically for him... I think it’s safe to say he’s spoiled as fuck
9272 2018-01-09 04:28:01 Mindnumbing, oil seeps naturally dwarf manmade spills in this area, and the area is as beautiful as always.  Your post is antithetical to geology of the area, and science in general.
9273 2018-01-09 04:27:52 Georgia needs a Navy 9:00 drive.
9274 2018-01-09 04:27:50 Only in a certain temperature as it’s coconut oil based.
9275 2018-01-09 04:27:37 Really how about the oil spill problem they got rid of funds to fatten their pockets they need to fix it
9276 2018-01-09 04:27:28 @realDonaldTrump @vp @Interior @SenShelby @GDouglasJones @RepAderholtNews  Protect our coastal waters from oil drilling.  Don’t sell out to Big Business.

9283 2018-01-09 04:26:33 John D. Rockefeller controlled most of America's oil refineries by founding a company which applied technologies to eliminate competition. His way of organizing trusts where former competitors were brought under single corporations came to be mirrored in other industries. #histry
9284 2018-01-09 04:26:23 I bought one recently, and it's my first one, called the urban decay de-slick, cause my face is a pollution's dream. it's pretty good reducing oil.
9285 2018-01-09 04:26:13 Will reduction in Liquidity be an issue for global and Indian Equities in 2018? 

Possible rise in crude oil prices and tighting by Central Banks (Fed and RBI) will lead to withdraw of liquidity impacting equity markets
9286 2018-01-09 04:26:12 Drum and Bugle Corps from Casper. Drum and a Bugle Corps from Casper, Wy. Kind of like professional marching band. You move in in May to learn the show. Tour across the US from June-August. Finals have been at Lucas Oil, but mine were also at the Rose Bowl.
9287 2018-01-09 04:25:53 Pence WHY AREN'T YOU OR ANYONE DOING SOMETHING TO FIX THE PROBLEM YOU ALL CREATED, DO YOU KNOW WHY OIL FUND STARTED ?WHY  PENCE YOU SHOULD BE FINED AND MADE TO PAY F OR IT WITH THE REST OF REPUBLICAN'S
9288 2018-01-09 04:25:53 What does this even mean? The pei gov has no plan to put forward to incentivise the market for sellers and buyers like Norway. Norway is not comparable either because the oil industry they set the economy around. Are you suggesting we setup some off shore rigs? #peipoli

9296 2018-01-09 04:25:13 popped a melatonin. got my oil diffuser goin. 
9297 2018-01-09 04:25:12 After the shower my mom would put vitamin E oil and let it soak into her skin idk if you tried that 
9298 2018-01-09 04:25:07 Cheap in terms of future oil prices really.
9299 2018-01-09 04:24:54 the winner of the trivia game gets 2 set the rules and pick the "weapons" for the oil fight, the winner of the oil fight gets to use the trivia winners social media for a day
The loser of it all gets to be on the wall of shame, which is an embarrassing freeze frame from the fight
9300 2018-01-09 04:24:54 Yo, for your next vid, can you eat a whole tub of cool whip? That would be nice.
PS why don't you have an @adultswim show?
Show idea-> it's called "Big Money Savila's Slippery Celebrities" it's a celebrity trivia game where the losers have to fight in a kiddy pool full of oil
9301 2018-01-09 04:24:43 Burger in the air fryer vs. fried burger has a massive difference in calories for the same burger.  I'm telling you, I can eat the same foods without the gook/grease/calories.  Steak Fries are the best with zero oil.  Just cook and season if needed.  50 calories versus 500.
9302 2018-01-09 04:24:42 It reminds him of an oil can
9303 2018-01-09 04:24:41 Have you used coconut oil??
9304 2018-01-09 04:24:41 coconut oil is a miracle worker
9305 2018-01-09 04:24:39 Except they all made it worse under Obama.
9306 2018-01-09 04:24:36 Even if you get oil will your owner and manager spend?
9307 2018-01-09 04:24:27 Guess who doesn't know how to read oil tank gages! Oh, how fun learning homeownership is.
9308 2018-01-09 04:24:20 Watching @maddow segment on burning oil tanker and oil spill clean-up fund axing. I think my government trying to dismember both the USA and the entire world.
9309 2018-01-09 04:24:13 Did they check your oil too? Seriously, I'm glad you're doing ok. Continued positive vibes. Please keep us posted Nana. 
9310 2018-01-09 04:24:07 We will drown in Oil!  In 10 years electric cars will be the norm led by China!  Trump is pushing 19th century oil coal when our kids future is mortgaged for robber barons and the climate is getting hotter and hotter!  #BlueWave2018 #climate
9311 2018-01-09 04:24:05 What a corrupt scumbag. He has let bill expire that created revenue to clean up oil spills after opening all waterways to drilling & cut regulations that prevented oil spills. I guess that one was for Tillerson & his other oil cronies at the expense of our environment
9312 2018-01-09 04:23:54 Better than oil.
9313 2018-01-09 04:23:52 Just drink castor oil. Same great taste.
9314 2018-01-09 04:23:49 I use grapeseed oil.
9315 2018-01-09 04:23:33 We dont need so much oil. Yes we will always need it, but for power we can off shore wind farm, and solar plants and roofs. We can make huge stides with investments. Tesla and other companies coming out with electric cars. This push for oil makes only sense to greedy
9316 2018-01-09 04:23:17 Nice looking crop there James, many tertiary branches? Oil or birdseed? #safflower
9317 2018-01-09 04:23:15 ED I am said: Man Warned China,Tanker Collide Oil this is just the beginning. Trump drilling  12-27-17 Sea give up the dead  2 at 1-4-18
9318 2018-01-09 04:22:55 Any oil spills need to result in an immediate suit against the @GOP  - demanding cleanup & mitigation funding.  #DumbFukGOP
9319 2018-01-09 04:22:52 I do and I am. Breathing is much easier, bloat is disappearing. Hips are still painful but it takes about 30 days for fish oil to get into the joints.
9320 2018-01-09 04:22:49 Senka perfect watery oil lebih best dari biore oil cleanser. Bau nya pun lebih sedap haha #EcaReview
9321 2018-01-09 04:22:42 Looks like Dawgs D is leaking oil....
9322 2018-01-09 04:22:40 Sally has a couple of good ones. Ion being one of my favorite. For scalp I’ll give you a natural one, it’s better. 5tbsp of olive oil, 1tsp of raw vinegar, 2tbsp of raw honey, lavender and tea tree oil if you like, it helps heal the scalp. Whip it all up, apply to scalp/30min.
9323 2018-01-09 04:22:34 GOP quietly let tax on oil co’s expire that provided $500 million/year to help clean up spills. WH also undid 2 regs that specifically protected against disasters like #DeepwaterHorizon. And put 47 oil leases for sale along both coasts. #followthemoney #PeacockforCongress #CA42
9324 2018-01-09 04:22:19 I haven't watched the series in ages. I just remember getting confused when the mythology had black oil, bees and different types of aliens.
9325 2018-01-09 04:22:19 Tea tree oil, spot treatment/drying lotion, and SPF DAILYYYYYYYY 

And water intake
9326 2018-01-09 04:22:15 Oil of cloves is good if you have a cavity. Soak a small bit of cotton in it and place in the hole if there is one. Biting down on an aspirin helps. Why haven't you been to a dentist yet?

9333 2018-01-09 04:21:39 Good idea. The world should probably shut down oil production everywhere because there is always some risk of another spill.

9344 2018-01-09 04:20:46 Lol oh, darn! I thought it would be good.
What was the oil? My bff has sleeping issues too and she started using aroma therapy oils in her bedroom humidifier.
9345 2018-01-09 04:20:37 We need an extraction fee on oil in CA to create a sovereign wealth fund aka rainy day fund. Why do red states have extraction fees and we in CA don’t .@Chevron?
9346 2018-01-09 04:20:22 I was a student at UCSB during that abomination of an oil spill. We cannot allow a re-do.

9348 2018-01-09 04:20:16 Any idea where oil comes from?
9349 2018-01-09 04:20:12 Are you as concerned as I am regarding his plans to sell leases for coastal oil drilling? Or removing safety regs? Or the 9 cent a barrel tax for fast response to spills? What are they doing w/the money already collected?
9350 2018-01-09 04:20:10 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
9351 2018-01-09 04:20:08 Deafen the whales oil spills NICE
9352 2018-01-09 04:20:07 Trump to open up all  off shore oceans to drilling. Trump rolls back regulations put in place after Deepwater Horizon disaster to lessen spills. Republicans do away with tax oil companies pay to clean up the oil if there is a spill. What could possibly go wrong?
9353 2018-01-09 04:19:47 Olive oil loosens it bit and steam from the shower

9356 2018-01-09 04:19:11 Sorry. It has happened to anyone who has ever tried to bleach palm oil, I'm guessing that's what you're doing.
9357 2018-01-09 04:19:11 I love my new job but hate getting oil under my nails every day
9358 2018-01-09 04:18:59 Biden, Clinton and Obama's ideas are wall street cronyism, big oil, permanent war for oil, corporatism, Zionism, all ideas which would cause revulsion in a normal human being. Not democrats, of course, they love permanent war, vote for it all the time.

9367 2018-01-09 04:17:01 An estimated 3M gallons of crude oil created a massive oil slick on our beautiful shore during the Santa Barbara oil spill. We said we’d never allow this to happen again, yet the Trump Administration wants to expand offshore drilling. We must stop it.

9374 2018-01-09 04:16:17 Doing my research on cooking/food oils now and it's interesting A number of oils appear to be suspicious due to how they were made, and it's better to replace them with things like olive oil and avocado oil or plain ol butter.
9375 2018-01-09 04:16:05 Trying castor oil in my hair because coconut oil does nothing.
9376 2018-01-09 04:16:00 Reason no. 262811 why I love my job: a coworker drove with me to a gas station after my shift tonight to put oil in my car and teach me how to do it because my car literally had no oil #blessed
9377 2018-01-09 04:15:58 Don't believe a word he says. He "fixed" taxes so the rich get richer. The Affordable Care Act so less people are covered. Environmental issues so big oil can poison the oceans. If he fixes farming,...well...let's just state I do not like factory farms.  He isn't on your side.
9378 2018-01-09 04:15:48 i always use vaseline on my lips to keep them moisturized. lately, i take a q-tip and use the coconut oil once again along my lash line. this has helped my lashes grow.

9382 2018-01-09 04:15:32 @SenateGOP,@HouseGOP We now know you have removed oil co tax to clean up large oil spills. In South China Sea, a tanker holding over a million barrels of oil is on fire and will explode. You are kidding yourselves if you think it won’t happen here. You are totally responsible.

9391 2018-01-09 04:13:58 @benmurraybruce is from Bayelsa. His Governor owes civil servants 54 months salary and I doubt if the whole population is up to that of Alimosho local government in Lagos yet they get 13% oil derivative allocation every month, and i have never seen a tweet about this. 50-50 Sir!

9394 2018-01-09 04:13:50 for a makeup remove i use coconut oil that can be found at any grocery store. this decomposes the makeup and then i wash my face twice to clear the oil then clean my skin.
9395 2018-01-09 04:13:33 Hmmm to do my coconut oil exfoliating scrub or a sheet mask? Decisions decisions.
9396 2018-01-09 04:13:19 WAY ahead of you - i've been using it for years. Its not as effective as another oil I liked that's been discontinued.

9398 2018-01-09 04:13:10 So many wonderful and good people out there, trying so hard, to save our planet and keep it healthy. It was heartbreaking today, to learn 
that this spill will spew 3Xs
the oil into our oceans than that of the Exxon Valdez spill. Fox News not talking about it. MSNBC will.

9403 2018-01-09 04:12:54 Tried to post article in Washington Post about Oil Tanker on fire in South China Seas. Trump just opened all waterways to drilling & at the same time cut a bill that created revenue for oil clean up AND cut regulations that prevented oil spills.

9432 2018-01-09 04:10:04 As Donald Trump and Republicans allow a tax on oil companies to expire that pays for disastrous oil spills.  Nice knowing you Earth.  Make you feel good Trump?

9436 2018-01-09 04:08:58 Trump tax bill contains hidden items: elimination of fee per barrel chg to oil/gas companies to fund oil spill cleanup plus go ahead to drill in Alaska Natl Wildlife Refuge. Now Trump is removing regulations instituted to prevent Deepwater Horizon disasters. @JoeNBC

9448 2018-01-09 04:08:13 To get lower cost of debt needs higher rating by rating agency. Developed countries hv lower cost of debt partly due to higher rating. Malaysia should focus on how to increase income. We should hoping increase in oil price in expense of malaysian cost of living.
9449 2018-01-09 04:08:13 @realDonaldTrump I would love to see you cut regulations on the trucking business. The Electronic Log books will destroy small trucking businesses. We take the jobs that large companies won’t, which include road oil for construction and livestock. Infrastructure will suffer.
9450 2018-01-09 04:08:06 Oh, so more oil = more bitter. That makes sense. Thanks!

9513 2018-01-09 03:59:58 What do you have to put on it. It's oil of some kind right?
9514 2018-01-09 03:59:56 I’ve been mixing this tea tree oil with this coconut oil, I brag different 
9515 2018-01-09 03:59:43 Yeah I've heard the oil is really good as a spot treatment
9516 2018-01-09 03:59:41 Hair dryer and coconut oil? 
9517 2018-01-09 03:59:39 I can smell gas or gas oil? Is it just me and the pain meds I took or should I look? Hmmmm....
9518 2018-01-09 03:59:26 取りあえず神祇令と二十二社覚えたらな
9519 2018-01-09 03:59:15 Don’t do things for oil and oil rig people on our lives. The gas prices won’t be any different.

Go back to helping your Daddy deport hard working immigrants and drill for oil, hopefully right on whatever beachfront property you own, Vanky.

9524 2018-01-09 03:57:57 How come they did not export sensitive technology and Weapons, they are laying to theirs nations because what is happening is different and they are exporting to Saudi Arabia all kind of  weapons to get more Saudi money and oil, which Saudi uses to kill Yemeni Child's
9525 2018-01-09 03:57:50 Rally on oil and gas, rally on.
9526 2018-01-09 03:57:49 I don't suppose you've overheard them talk about which oils are the healthiest? As far as I know olive oil is pretty much the healthiest, Though also the most expensive.
9527 2018-01-09 03:57:46 Remember when Oprah gave us Snake oil salesman Dr. Oz? How about Dr. Phil who who advocates abuse of sick people? My fav had to be Sylvia Browne the "psychic" proven false 1000 times over that Opera loved. No Opera should not be President

9529 2018-01-09 03:57:43 Coconut oil just a dab
9530 2018-01-09 03:57:43 I love the differences in high between flower and concentrates(shatter,oil,etc), been a minute since I had actual weed this feels good lmfao
9531 2018-01-09 03:57:42 Well, we have a businessman in there now, we’ve had a peanut farmer, an oil tycoon, and an actor.  Guess it is not impossible.
9532 2018-01-09 03:57:40 oil diffusers are a blessing.
9533 2018-01-09 03:57:40 Didn't say Afghanistan was in the Middle East. Neither America nor Western Europe colonized the Middle East - pretty sure most areas were well established before America was formed. Our desire for oil - which started as early as the 1950s, did help in destabilization.
9534 2018-01-09 03:57:32 They were ginormous but was it for good policy or wishful thinking? Wishing that the price of oil will go back up, as soon as they get elected? The current dependency on oil revenues is because of them. What would they change? #ableg
9535 2018-01-09 03:57:08 Aaaaand back home! Now to eat what's left in my fridge...which is the most boring dinner ever. Some leftover quinoa and baby spinach. Gonna warm this up with some olive oil & a pinch of salt. I wish I had some chicken :c
9536 2018-01-09 03:57:03 But where are the wealthiest reaping 90%? I am hearing that it's the middle class, ppl like me and all my family. Some who are farmers.... so I just want to wait and SEE what happens in the next few mos and see if it's for better or worse. I am pro-fracking, oil and not from M.E.
9537 2018-01-09 03:57:03 just going wild on some undiluted tea tree oil
9538 2018-01-09 03:56:48 Weapons and oil. Think pipeline
9539 2018-01-09 03:56:45 I also just switched to a skin regime of Dr. Bronner’s and coconut oil based lotions and my eczema flares have been thanking me so much
9540 2018-01-09 03:56:43 Or Senator Murkowski if you establish the right to drill for oil while clubbing baby seals.
9541 2018-01-09 03:56:40 The world's most valuable resource is milagapodi, not oil or data.
9542 2018-01-09 03:56:39 You know it’s a bad day when you can’t find your jar of coconut oil 
9543 2018-01-09 03:56:37 You skip it if you have a peanut allergy. They fry everything in peanut oil.

9545 2018-01-09 03:56:15 The simple reason this was done...1) oil 2 ) money generated from wars 3) blaming Islam 4) destabilizing the middle east 5) establishing a global exchange of currency leading to 1 world order 6) seeing how much common people can be manipulated with 7) using fear 2 control people
9546 2018-01-09 03:56:07 She has had profitable appeal selling snake oil.
9547 2018-01-09 03:56:05 It actually does pretty well as far as hydrating skin goes but you def need to seal it with an oil (I use vitamin e)
9548 2018-01-09 03:56:04 いろいろ。落ち着いたらそのうちな。
9549 2018-01-09 03:55:52 @speedawaysmog there ya go Mitch! Gotta look good!

9560 2018-01-09 03:54:38 That feeling after u place the fish inside the frying pan and then u suddenly run away from it just for u to not to be in contact with the splash of oil. 
9561 2018-01-09 03:54:36 @realDonaldTrump , there isn't one single AMERICAN PATRIOT in the WH, including you. ALL of you are simply working to ENRICH yourselves. Nothing is more clear to me as THAT. Destroying oceans, removing a 9 cent tax on each barrel of oil set aside for spills.

9563 2018-01-09 03:54:21 Boleh guna lavender. Campur dengan virgin coconut oil. Lavender elok bagi kulit lembut, bantu sembuh luka

9573 2018-01-09 03:53:30 You know what try fixing something over here oil spill we are in dire need republican's, trump cut funding nikki yea what I thought
9574 2018-01-09 03:53:20 It ain't olive oil they reap, word games, till late, think it's time I ate, just been rude to a mate, where go my flow? I don't know, wanna be in a valley, not a back alley, traffic, non stop, ain't got a job, too scared to mop
9575 2018-01-09 03:53:15 You’re a snake oil salesman.
9576 2018-01-09 03:53:14 俺は基本的に善を行うという善より悪を行わないという善の方が好きなんだなぁという話
9577 2018-01-09 03:53:04 You need the hash oil
9578 2018-01-09 03:52:54 It hold true for everything. Oil won't just disappear all at once right? As the supply becomes more scarce, the cost will rise. People will be forced to use less of it and will find another way to produce the need oil serves.
9579 2018-01-09 03:52:52 Went to the gym, washed my hair, did a face mask, exfoliated my skin, applied body oil, and painted my nails.
9580 2018-01-09 03:52:43 Baby oil, no condom for me 
9581 2018-01-09 03:52:42 Don't anyone buy into that "spend more time w/ my family" crap. Most of them will prolly join Republican lobbying firms, the corporate boards of Big Oil & Big Coal, and others will beg Trump to be nominated for some political senior advisor job.
9582 2018-01-09 03:52:37 Yes Justin, it is.  So, you like Red Ken, a man who has been a big fan of Venezuela (chaotic mess despite massive oil reserves) & Cuba (happily bumped off or imprisoned masses of political opponents). Oh, & the IRA too. Nice company you keep, says a lot for your judgement.
9583 2018-01-09 03:52:34 Sure she's the CEO of a $ Multibillion Corp
Yeah she supported wars of aggression against countries that weren't a threat but were strategically located and had oil and mineral deposits
She ISN'T a Corporatist Neoliberal b/c she invited Bakari to a bonfire at her beach house.
9584 2018-01-09 03:52:28 Absolutely! It's not like oil spills or leaks know state lines. I don't want any drilling off any American coast. I'd rather pay $5/gallon for gas than see the destruction of our coast, tourism, fishing industries, livelihoods, environment. It's just not worth it. Ask Louisiana.
9585 2018-01-09 03:52:25 How's NFL attendance nowadays? I turned my tv off about a year ago.  Busy moving oil rigs anyway.
9586 2018-01-09 03:52:25 Human trafficking in the man camps/oil patches is epidemic. The system and LE look the other way. $$$$$

9591 2018-01-09 03:52:03 Other things that have gone down under the NDP are Investor confidence, provincial credit rating, new oil exports & Albertan's bank balances.

9613 2018-01-09 03:48:57 Today @ 21:07 - "Venezuela #crude #oil production declined another 151K bpd in December, according to PDVSA executives." **Keep in mind... Venezuela is one of the world's largest exporters of oil and has the world's largest proven oil reserves... #Oil $CL_F
9614 2018-01-09 03:48:53 Notice how our new policy of unfettered offshore oil drilling in the US dovetails nicely with global warming and thawing out the Arctic Russian oil fields?

9622 2018-01-09 03:48:00 I am (perhaps unreasonably) filled with rage at these hipster-nonsense tortilla chips that are trying to call coconut oil an “ancestral fat” that needs to be brought back into the food chain.
9623 2018-01-09 03:47:41 THANK GOD I CAN DUMP MY MOTOR OIL INTO THE RIVER! FUCK MY NEIGHBORS! THEYRE MY COMPETITORS HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAH
9624 2018-01-09 03:47:40 To quote @Rifftrax, if Elton John and George Michael were to rub each other with peanut oil while listening to Liza Minnelli, it would be less gay than this.
9625 2018-01-09 03:47:31 We need government leaders who listen to scientific facts vs. special interest - aka oil/gas and climate change deniers.  Vote them out in 2018!!
9626 2018-01-09 03:47:31 Salt, pepper, garlic powder, and olive oil. 10 min at 405, then another 15 min flipped over. I cut into the breasts and it was so juicy, I thought at first I’d undercooked. Nope. Perfect all the way through.
9627 2018-01-09 03:47:31 Libs would say this is a drop in the bucket if for any bleeding heart cause. #hypocrites
9628 2018-01-09 03:47:30 Beard oil is very easy to apply and takes just seconds.

9630 2018-01-09 03:47:20 Here is a supposed #oil market expert who calls others names for their opinions not understanding that the shutdown of the Forties Pipeline System required closure of platforms, that their is no storage on platforms and only minimal where the pipeline comes on shore.  LOL!

9634 2018-01-09 03:46:31 You just sprinkle with olive oil, salt and pepper but for how long do you bake it?
9635 2018-01-09 03:46:28 Drain about 1/2 of oil from the station wagon out in the garage. Brush it on, it’ll get that sheen on it AND keep everyone from over eating!
9636 2018-01-09 03:46:28 Great time to be in the oil biz as of today you can Drill (all coastal waters are now up for grabs) spill (no more pesky enviromental regs) and walk away (no more clean up funds saved for that inevitable OILY day!#yourbuttonisassmallasyourteenyweeny

9641 2018-01-09 03:45:31 Thank God for lavender oil!
9642 2018-01-09 03:45:17 Lavender essential oil made me feel sick smelling it in the diffuser, the sweet orange scent was fine though. I didn't expect to feel so nauseated using lavender oil. I threw the whole bottle away 
9643 2018-01-09 03:45:08 That had to be one of those spendy $49.95 oil changes!  :)
9644 2018-01-09 03:44:52 I need to burn sage on my whole life. Or put coconut oil on it or something.

9647 2018-01-09 03:44:43 Iranian oil tanker ship spills load off China from collision of bulk freighter and all is on fire with danger of exploding. This will hurt marine life, add to CO2 in the atmosphere and irreparably hurt the planet.

9651 2018-01-09 03:43:21 Also, what are the chances we get a quick rise after big blue down does it's job? I mean, we had a blue wedge upward like 2 months ago. I forgot to ask you about that. Has it done it's job already? Because I thought the wedges take time to play out, like purple down did before :)
9652 2018-01-09 03:43:08 On quest to grow my hair to what I’ll call “scary black metal length”, I have become obsessed with Tea Tree Oil in all my hair care products. #haircare #iloveyou
9653 2018-01-09 03:43:05 Okey so 250ml bottle is $19.95 and they will have some in stock late July early August. Bumper crop for 2018! All the other oil has sold out.  I’ll keep ya posted.

9655 2018-01-09 03:42:58 Oil give us more oil. It was supposed to be gone by now anyway. Oh yeah hyper imagination of crazy environmentalists.
9656 2018-01-09 03:42:56 Your state uses the most oil!!! You want Texas to produce all of it? OK, we will send you oil, but you have to quit sending us your citizens.
9657 2018-01-09 03:42:46 That was interesting, essential oil class. Sounds like too much work to me.
9658 2018-01-09 03:42:40 So awesome how @realDonaldTrump and his GOP just got rid of the OSLTF and now there's one million barrels of oil burning in the ocean. Not to mention that they want to overhaul saftey procedures to keep this shit from happening on our coasts. Like, Genius..
9659 2018-01-09 03:42:17 Im asking you to steal a fan.. If i wanted you to do my dirty work i would ask you to do my oil change or clean the yard. Now thats my dirty work Danie 
9660 2018-01-09 03:42:15 Millennials are killing Oil & Gas UK
9661 2018-01-09 03:42:10 I think UC Santa Barbara students can attest to this fact as removing tar balls from our bodies and clothing decades later was part of school life. We really don't need oil drilling, when we still have to deal with the effects of oil spills today. Thank you for fighting for us.
9662 2018-01-09 03:41:56 Some sorta burnt on deposit, prolly from oil and coolant

9665 2018-01-09 03:41:33 Put coconut oil in my hair as an oil treatment and it worked wonders

9674 2018-01-09 03:40:41 I moisturize with baby oil after every shower  my skin is so soft
9675 2018-01-09 03:40:38 1/4 MCCONNELL OIL SPILL FUND YOU ALL TOOK OUT TO FATTEN YOUR FUCKING POCKETS THE SAFTY LAWS YOU HACKED NOW WHAT HOW IS IT GONNA GET CLEANED UP ARE YOU THAT DUMB OR GREEDY WHY WAS FUND STARTED MITCH @SenateMajLdr

9677 2018-01-09 03:40:31 oil 62.23.  WOWowowowow.  Right at the 2015 consolidation top that failed.  WOW.  No edge imho.  Nuclear break up or breakdown.  I have NO CLUE.
9678 2018-01-09 03:40:26 It basically tightens up your pores and sucks the excess oil out your skin.

9682 2018-01-09 03:39:50 Using oil first was perfect  makeup came off like nothing
9683 2018-01-09 03:39:49 Oil of Oregano, hydrasense spray, bone broth, tea and juice! I hope you feel better! 
9684 2018-01-09 03:39:47 Turns out oil companies want to drill for oil and gas in places where oil and gas actually exist. Weird.

9693 2018-01-09 03:39:06 2017 taught me about compatibility and the lack thereof. No matter how much you love someone to the moon and back, oil and water cant mix. And it's something i think back on everyday.

9695 2018-01-09 03:38:57 I forgot to put lotion on this morning smh so when i get out the shower imma oil myself up 
9696 2018-01-09 03:38:43 Because there would be nothing to replace it. I am talking about food shortages, gas or oil, water, etc.

9704 2018-01-09 03:37:24 I think this time I'll be waiting for a second big blue arrow down before adding on another short. Please do tell us if it appears. I've gotten to know these loons too well to expect them to quit that quickly. Patience either way :)

9707 2018-01-09 03:37:04 Ellie laughed a bit; of course Pinkie would have bright pink silverware and utensils, but she loved it about her. 

She pulled one of the big pans out from a cupboard and heated it up with some oil, adding in the ground beef and some spices.
9708 2018-01-09 03:36:48 I loved roasted veggies, and not too much oil (if any) is needed too
9709 2018-01-09 03:36:43 One got me a gift card for a massage the other got me an oil diffuser like omg I’m so happy lmao
9710 2018-01-09 03:36:37 “Oil”  hmmm

9713 2018-01-09 03:36:19 They're actually caused by oil slick roads, something thats very common in places of high traffic and very little rain. Its not because people just randomly forget how to drive.
9714 2018-01-09 03:36:17 やっべぇ目薬忘れた
9715 2018-01-09 03:36:09 you're keeping the oil companies in business.
9716 2018-01-09 03:36:01 I'm not about the oil and have shared about it.
9717 2018-01-09 03:35:54 Market manipulation is the way of the oil industry ... I see a battle on the horizon between OPEC and US producers ... but, till then, the biggest losers will always be the consumer ...
9718 2018-01-09 03:35:39 Tea trea oil I needs that playa
9719 2018-01-09 03:35:36  a little vegetable oil on the wax paper?
9720 2018-01-09 03:35:33 Maybe he will cause a big oil spill just to prove a point and hopefully he will go to jail just to prove a point

9723 2018-01-09 03:35:09 Why did the Iran and Iraq war continue for so long? Read your history and learn that it was prolonged with small skirmishes. Each skirmish caused oil prices to increase and price increases led to more sellers. Saudi (low cost producer) lost the most b/c of supply competition
9724 2018-01-09 03:35:07 Coconut oil in winter be like....
"Waise tow mai pighla hua launda hun....

9725 2018-01-09 03:34:37 It’s the oddest thing. After a few bumps and running errands the ambient lights flickered in. It’s not serious but frustrating. When we book our 6mth oil change, we’ll get them to look at it.
9726 2018-01-09 03:34:26 That's one heck of an oil change!
9727 2018-01-09 03:34:24 They show good business sense. Not getting fooled by Green Hysteria. Saudis will be soon running low on their supply and by then they can take over Canadian oil sands.

Spill's extent unknown but could be worst since 1991 when 260,000 tonnes of oil leaked off Angolan coast.

9787 2018-01-09 03:26:42 they are building the biggest mega mosque in Canada in Fort McMurray, Alberta, i'm sure they are hoping the crime minister and his globalist friends will keep the oil in the ground until their Canadian take over

9803 2018-01-09 03:24:51 Playing Devil's Advocate: Perhaps it isn't that super tanker demand doesn't understand the market, but is forecasting growth in oil demand? OPEC isn't quite the master of prediction, at least not in the last 3.5 years.

9805 2018-01-09 03:24:43 Trump Admin has moved to eliminate the reserve fund for off shore oil drilling accidents, moved to eliminate safety regulations for offshore drilling, and is moving to open all waters along all shorelines to offshore drilling, against the will of governors. The swamp lives.
9806 2018-01-09 03:24:23 @maddow so much bad news about OIL.   Always watch your show but the news can be really scary and depressing.  Great reporting on Sen Grassley & possible reading of dossier testimony
9807 2018-01-09 03:23:49 do my eyes deceive me or did they add more oil in post
9808 2018-01-09 03:23:33 Please be careful anyone who thinks of using castor oil for labor. It can have very bad outcomes for the baby. What happens to you also happens to baby. You shit=baby shits. now baby ingests the poop and then can get an infection and possibly die. Please be careful. It can happen
9809 2018-01-09 03:23:31 at nights, i’ve been dousing my feet in coconut oil & wearing socks to sleep

9815 2018-01-09 03:22:10 @realDonaldTrump has be unable to kill Puerto Ricans with the help of a hurricane. Mybe currents will flow 1 million gallons of oil that wat to finish the job. Republicans cut 09 cent tax to clean up such spills. Funds are gone! Two different procedures will killed as well so
9816 2018-01-09 03:21:51 Now we know why Tillerson is happy with his job. I am sure he still has a foot in the door with the oil industry. 

Soon the CFRs  (Code of Federation Regulations) will be reduced to one volume.

9818 2018-01-09 03:21:45 I'm sure we can all pretty much agree that it's better for middle class Americans to pay more taxes then for oil companies to.

9820 2018-01-09 03:21:35 I can see by your profile that you are a pretty smart amd the things you have to say are really popular with a lot of people. 8. But anyway, I took my oil change money and invested in the market. I'm retired now thanks to #Trump !
9821 2018-01-09 03:21:34 Nope, he’ll be buoyed up by all the oil floating on the surface, thanks to his reversal of offshore drilling regulations. It’s the oil company employees who will sink when platforms explode and tankers sink.

9825 2018-01-09 03:21:02 We need Democrat oil and Republican oil. Home grown versus import. As long as Democrats are at the mercy of other countries for energy they shouldn’t have issues with paying 3-4x more for gas and oil made products. You carry your gas card to use by your political party.

9833 2018-01-09 03:19:53 NO REALLY...TRUMP SCREWED UP OIL DEREGULATION AND THE 9 CENT PER BARREL CLEAN UP FUND...HEY  DUMBTARD DONNIE...WHAT COULD GO WRONG?
9834 2018-01-09 03:19:49 @Trump is leading America to disaster he & his Republican cohorts have killed # the oil disaster slush fund tax on the oil companies. When an oil spill destroys the coastline & the economies of coastal states, Republicans want taxpayers to pay for cleanup!
9835 2018-01-09 03:19:39 What @maddow?!?!? Now, an oil spill.  The Republicans can't get any clearer evidence they're wrong than a universe telling them using irony.

9837 2018-01-09 03:19:29 As we wait for that oil tanker to explode off the coast of Shanghai, we can all rest easy that the GOP voted to get rid of the 9c tax on barrels that is put away to clean up inevitable spills. At least the spill isn't in the U.S. of A, right? Whew.
9838 2018-01-09 03:19:11 You can have a dream about riding a horse, or you can have a dream about drowning in oil!
9839 2018-01-09 03:19:01 Ur saying bcuz he doesn't have power, he shouldn't call out what's going on in Congress so the People r made aware what @GOP r doing? That doesn't make sense either. They just got rid of the 9c oil tax to help pay for oil spills then allowed drilling off the coast of #California

9855 2018-01-09 03:17:01 Sen Judiciary cmte, which consists of 9 members, had 7 yes votes and 2 senators who passed on those votes. 1 of those 2 senators, Mike Bell, R-Riceville, expressed concerns that if the CBD oil bill was passed it would ultimately lead to the legalization of recreational marijuana.

9857 2018-01-09 03:16:46 My family has been in oil and gas for three generations in Alberta. And before that we dug coal. Literally. I don’t know what the future’s going to be like. I didn’t think Trump is going to be president. But I believe global warming is real and it’s happening in Alberta
9858 2018-01-09 03:16:32 There must not be any oil or gas there.

9866 2018-01-09 03:15:34 Trying to eat healthier this year. Started tonight with pan seared chicken in a salad consisting of spinach, cilantro, avocado(gross), tomatoes, cucumbers, and an olive oil dressing. It was good.

9868 2018-01-09 03:15:28 If you don’t know what to get me for my birthday I rlly like those air wick essential oil scents
9869 2018-01-09 03:15:26 USATectonic. #Republicans systematic war on the environment adds the elimination of a 9 cent tax held in a fund for oil spill clean ups. This critically important oil spill clean up fund is essential! Oil spills happen all the time land and sea. #GOP has an environment hatred.
9870 2018-01-09 03:15:22 Sorry, take too long. Simply run a chart with Gold against $/JPY and $/CNY recently and it's apparent. The latter likely to do with CNY Gold and Oil futures contracts and de-dollarization.
9871 2018-01-09 03:15:07 So the people lining up for help after floods, fires, and oil industry downturns were what?
9872 2018-01-09 03:15:00 Thank you for doing this! Also concerned about the barrel tax they are taking away that is a fund for oil spills...any comment on this?
9873 2018-01-09 03:14:52 GOP axed oil spill trust fund. It generated $500 million in federal revenue per year. The money, collected through a 9 cents-per-barrel tax on domestic crude oil and imported crude oil and petroleum products,the main source of revenue for Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund.
9874 2018-01-09 03:14:38 Olive has a low smoke point. Always fry in peanut, corn, or veggie oil.
9875 2018-01-09 03:14:34 Yeah I have all of our oil receipts, thank god
9876 2018-01-09 03:14:05 what are you guys going to do about that chinese oil spill, couldn't you let us build some safe pipelines and use humanely extracted Canadian oil instead of supporting regimes that don't give a crap about human rights

9884 2018-01-09 03:13:01 Yeah sort of like the department of energy which was started to free us from foreign oil back in the 70s

That was a real success story for America

I'm not sure the name though can anyone out in Twitter land help with that?

Probably be the Bureau of Internet control

9887 2018-01-09 03:12:44 Simon has conveniently forgotten that the grid allows generation facilities to be widely dispersed yet able to coordinate generation thus allowing gas (or coal, or oil) to fill in for wind and/or solar when they are indisposed.
9888 2018-01-09 03:12:33 @SpeakerRyan  @NancyPelosi  @SenatorSchumer  Maj Ldr, another jewel per evening news is that all- knowing seers of the GOP took out the 9 Cents/barrel tax to use for future oil disaster. Are you not owned by big oil? Tragically, you are designing future EPA crises!

9931 2018-01-09 03:06:53 Oil projects had been mostly overseas. Subject to double tax. Aramco looking for IPO. Trying keep prices hi. So tax “breaks” idea not applicable
9932 2018-01-09 03:06:37 It's not going to be pleasant by any means, but there is recourse. Also get some hard fact oil costs, how many gallons you've been billed for exactly per current market rate

9936 2018-01-09 03:06:11 Exon Valdez in 1989 Trust Fund financed by tax on barrels of oil to be used for oil related disasters. Tax was allowed to expire with Republican Tax Bill. Cut safety rules to oil industry as “overly burdensome”. Oil industry benefits as our environment deals with disaster.
9937 2018-01-09 03:06:11 “Bert ano ba yn? Ang mahal ng pagpapachange oil sainyo. 4k inabot ng 1st change oil ko. Pakicheck nmn kung tama yung computation nila.”

Mag Minola cooking oil ka nalang sir
9938 2018-01-09 03:06:09 If they gross over $200M/yr they're just selling snake oil by spamming airport ads in front of suits.
9939 2018-01-09 03:06:02 Tillerson must be thrilled with the deregulation of protections to prevent oil spills, and no more taxation going into the fund to clean one up, when, not if, it happens. 
Way to go. #KillingourPlanet

9943 2018-01-09 03:05:41 CF-Crystal has around 1 million barrels or 42 million US gallons of oil This is nearly four times the amount of oil spilled by the #ExxonValdez when it ran aground in Alaska in 1989. @RepGusBilirakis

9944 2018-01-09 03:05:39 me, opening the package: coconut and pear lip balm fUCK YES
me, immediately after putting it on: this is just coconut oil on my lips im not a fan
9945 2018-01-09 03:05:33 @maddow the thing to realize about the oil spill fund that will now languish- oil companies are limited in their liabilities when accidents happen or disasters strike.  take a look. If you are harmed you may never be made whole by the perpetrators.

9953 2018-01-09 03:05:07 Once again Rachel Maddow kicks a*s tonight must watch Trump Mueller/ oil rig fire tax cuts tax pd by companies ended for oil spills clean up
9954 2018-01-09 03:05:04 Oprah, pop psychology bookclub, president.  Well, we had a b movie actor, some oil men, various non leaders.  The bar is in the dirt and anyone can run.
9955 2018-01-09 03:05:01 I have no idea. I suspect Klein boosterism. Alberta swings from arrogant bragging when oil prices are high to whining entitlement when they are low. AB contributes about 15% to Canada's GDP.
9956 2018-01-09 03:04:57 .@realDonaldTrump 2-you are getting rid of the money allotted to clean up oil spills! You are creating hell on earth! Letting the oil corporations do whatever the f*ck they want. U R evil, hateful and stupid. U want to ruin earth. All the governors on both coasts don't want this.
9957 2018-01-09 03:04:55 Had a bad day? Smoke oil and eat ice cream while watching #Power and i PROMISE life will be good again.
9958 2018-01-09 03:04:54 It's no longer a question what party you belong to when the US is being systematically destroyed. Why would you want offshore drilling in the US. What happens to our Waters when oil spills. Your party is destroying the country for money.
9959 2018-01-09 03:04:53 Coconut oil is a must
9960 2018-01-09 03:04:41 Listening to @maddow & she is talking about how the tax that was put in place to create a fund to pay for any future oil spill clean up is going away. Administration wants to open coasts to drilling. No money for disasters.
9961 2018-01-09 03:04:32 @maddow, an important fact about the oil tanker is that it's not crude oil, it is a very thin light oil as for use in fine machinery.  That means the oil slick can disperse and be much larger than a crude oil slick.  A much bigger problem than Exxon!
9962 2018-01-09 03:04:32 What about our #fishermen, #fish #farming when you throw away the #tax to #cleanup #oilspills in #taxcut.. who’s gonna pay Donny.

9964 2018-01-09 03:04:26 I have A&D ointment on my tattoo and peppermint oil in my hair and both these scents strong af lmao
9965 2018-01-09 03:03:59 This is what I have heard. The South (e.g. Biafra) produces the oil, but the North spend the money. The Scots say they tap the oil from the North Sea but London gets the money. Arabic speaking part of Iran produces oil, but Terhan gets the money. Similar gripe across countries.
9966 2018-01-09 03:03:57 Ehh, I’m fine with argan oil lah. Bila masa pulak aku allergic
9967 2018-01-09 03:03:39 What are they selling y'all in these commercials?! If you worried about aging drink water and use coconut oil lol
9968 2018-01-09 03:03:37 So will Mexico pay for oil spills going forward?
9969 2018-01-09 03:03:35 And opening shores for drilling along with eliminating $0.09 per barrel tax for oil spill fund. Good week for our oil oligarchs.
9970 2018-01-09 03:03:31 It just sounded negative when you put it that way. Nonetheless, females like that are stupid anyway. You have a better chance of striking oil than getting drafted into a professional sports league.
9971 2018-01-09 03:03:29 Oil theft syndicate... wonder if it has anything to do with a fat guy up north and his button-envy? (no, the one's that non-orange)
9972 2018-01-09 03:03:25 Thx @maddow for your important info about the dismaydefinition thing of oil regulations. Wow! And there is a big oil ship burning right now in S China? OMG!
9973 2018-01-09 03:03:18 Every Canadian benefits and relies on oil/gas didn't think I needed to say that. 
Yes EVs will run on wind/solar/hydro/nuke & natgas $50,000 EVs range about 500+km in summer & ~300km in -20c. Superchargers fill u up in 30-45 min which about right for food etc. Tech is improving
9974 2018-01-09 03:02:51 Thank U & let's talk about Trump's fixation on destroying Earth w oil drilling in ocean! @SenatorCollins vote NO!
9975 2018-01-09 03:02:39 I made body oil spray and it smells so nice I wanna hurry up and make sure it won’t break me out or give me a wash so I can douse myself in it
9976 2018-01-09 03:02:38 Hey, 
Watching Rachel tonight, a yuge oil spill! It has occurred to me, we need to start drinking oil. We need to get our bodies used to consuming oil.There will not be a cup of water that will not be at least 50% oil by the time these assholes are done with our oceans!
9977 2018-01-09 03:02:31 Simple oil of cloves...
9978 2018-01-09 03:02:30 Thank you 45 for getting rid of safety monitoring rules for offshore drilling!!And the Oil Spill Liability trust fund,which responds to oil spills,Rep let expire!And now letting offshore drilling on both coasts! The oil companies thank you,the people and the Earth don’t!
9979 2018-01-09 03:02:29 oil me up

9980 2018-01-09 03:02:26 @maddow @SenSanders @MMFlint @dailykos News that Trump is going against all to support big oil with drilling off every US coast, no regulation & no more disaster funds- this is not only a country I don't want to live in but this criminal (Trump) is ruining the world & all sacred.
9981 2018-01-09 03:02:25 My whole 2018 mood is me being showered + in bed by 10pm with my oil diffuser burning & my face covered in rose hip oil
9982 2018-01-09 03:02:19 So no funds for cleanups, deregulated safety measures to help prevent another Deep Water Horizon and open up drilling up and down both coasts. Wonder how many Russian oil companies will be off the coast of CA or NC
9983 2018-01-09 03:02:19 You tweeting about bullshit instead of trying to find solutions to the damsg er you did regarding taking away oil spill SAFTY laws to stop it WHY HOW COME YOUR NOT SAYING ANYTHING

9986 2018-01-09 03:02:14 Couldn’t States enact an extremely high tax for the transport of any offshore oil?  Make the process economically unviable?  Just sayin’...  #offshoredrilling
9987 2018-01-09 03:02:13 @lisamurkowski @SenDanSullivan @DonYoungAK While you're crowing about the TaxScam, tell us why you killed oil spill prevention provisions!

9989 2018-01-09 03:01:59 A tanker containing approx. 1 million barrels of oil is burning off the south China coast. It is in peril of exploding and releasing 3 times the volume of oil lost in the Exxon Valdez disaster. This is the kind of thing that reminds us why fossil fuel consumption is fool hardy.

9993 2018-01-09 03:01:50 It’s happening now off the coast of Shanghai. 100 million barrels of oil burning, waiting for tanker to blow. U S no longer has safety precautions or additional slush funds. Thx GOP
9994 2018-01-09 03:01:43 Thanks, @maddow, for mentioning that Congress allowed the oil spill trust fund tax to expire, but you referred to the fund as a "slush fund", which has negative connotations. #inners #msnbc
9995 2018-01-09 03:01:40 @MSNBC Are EPA and Trump watching oil spill fire. More to come.  Who cares about the USA first --NOT
 #alternativefacts #care Why remove regulations wthout public discussion.  #Honesty # Safety
9996 2018-01-09 03:01:39 @realDonaldTrump why did your administration just cut safeguards for major oil spills especially as there is one right now on the South China sea? And cut the fee charged to companies that drill off shore as you now want even more drilling. SAD. No protections on our coastlines.

10000 2018-01-09 03:01:29 Sounds more like they were in cahoots with an oil theft syndicate un this case; you're right about corporate governance though
10001 2018-01-09 03:01:20 Perghh master. Jot tambah face oil jer tue pon dh 30-40mnt sbb toner buat 3-5 layer
10002 2018-01-09 03:01:13 @funder and all @maddow last piece re GOP got rid of oil tax for funds for oil spill while tanker on fire in So. China Sea with 3x oil on Exxon Valdez also gor rid of safety regs and allowing drilling on all coasts. Do we just sit here and wait for tanker to explode. Please help
10003 2018-01-09 03:01:10 Oh and my face is staying moisturized from apricot oil from all this cold weather
10004 2018-01-09 03:01:08 Administration just rolled back provisions to protect our waters from offshore drilling. No funding available for catastrophic oil spills.  It is unacceptable. Governor is up and down both coast are against this ruling.
10005 2018-01-09 03:01:05 DisSter waiting to happen! Abolish oil spill fund paid by 9 cent tax to companies on each gallon sold. Repeal of safety rules and allowance of offshore drilling is gust to oil companies. Public be damned- right Rachel??
10006 2018-01-09 03:01:02 We must stop the US Admin from destroying our way of life. A repeal of the Oil Rainy Day Fund 9 cents per barrel? and a repeal of safety regulations on big oil rigs? It’s getting away with murder. The GOP must step up @maddow
10007 2018-01-09 03:01:01 What is the date of the next march on the White House to protest Trump administration okaying oil drilling off east & west coasts, the elimination of emergency oil spill funding and all other oil industry regulations?
There must be plans...?
10008 2018-01-09 03:01:01 OIL DIFF: 6.25 -> 6.25
10009 2018-01-09 03:01:00 @SecretaryZinke you sure as hell don't care about grandchildren's future, do you? You kill protections from off-shore drilling, kill the regulations that protect workers from another Deep Water Horizon disaster, & kill the tax that funds the emergeny clean up from oil disasters.
10010 2018-01-09 03:00:55 @NDResistTrump @SenJohnHoeven and @RepKevinCramer killed the rainy day slush fund designed to help with the next oil spill, like Deep Horizon, while giving big oil open access to off shore drilling on the East and West Coast.
10011 2018-01-09 03:00:47 Making America Great Again means protecting our oceans, holding Oil and Gas Exploration Corporations accountable for their disasters.
10012 2018-01-09 03:00:43 and the FUNDING   for the oil spill clean up  ? killed by the GOP vote.  $500 million dollars to clean up major oil spills   gone
10013 2018-01-09 03:00:42 Crippling regulations like the .9cent tax for oil spills that you just axed ! What a fool you are !! Just look what’s happening in China  A tanker with a million gals of crude burning most likely to explode ! Regulations are necessary!!!
10014 2018-01-09 03:00:42 All the oil spills in the gulf. I stopped eating seafood for a reason....
10015 2018-01-09 03:00:36 I sleep better when I put lavender oil on the bottom of my feet.
10016 2018-01-09 03:00:35 @maddow 2 questions. 1 what happens to the money currently in the oil spill liability fund?  2. When will the gas prices drop by .09?
