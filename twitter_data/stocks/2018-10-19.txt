2 2018-10-21 23:56:21 We changed our packaging a little while ago, retail stores are phasing out older designs, but we settled on one we really love. Many new products, but holding true to our line. Stocks will be back up soon! Thanks for your patience!
3 2018-10-21 23:56:10 Lets see trumpism, more jobs, stocks up, unemployment down,  taxes down, job market wide open.  Trumpism it is. Liberal socialism, open borders, protecting the criminals instead of the citizens,  higher taxes. It would take two of me to make 400 lbs.

Hi Good day! 

Any update regarding the stocks of Time Magazine BTS cover issue? 

We have done some reservation last week. Hoping we will get ours. 

Thank you!
7 2018-10-21 23:49:13 For about RM4.5B...we got the long Penang 2nd bridge over water~only RM188M/km. And that bridge is very wide...can probably accommodate 6 lanes of MRT.

How come we are paying RM270M/km for LRT and RM435m/km?

10 2018-10-21 23:47:05 My 401(k) is in the tank and so are my stocks. I did so much better under Obama. Sure the "tax cut" helps me, but it is bankrupting our nation.
11 2018-10-21 23:46:51 Every single news article on my feed is bearish. Every one.

"Chinese economy worse than crashing"

"10% pullback in US stocks will cause depression"

"China unwilling to talk, no end to trade war in sight"

Can't help but feel like local bottom is near.

40 2018-10-21 23:38:18 You realize that when you see stocks dropping its already too late, right? You have to buy low and sell high, but what you're describing is selling low and buying high. When stock goes down, don't sell it! Sit on it or buy more! When it gets value back, you're better off!
41 2018-10-21 23:37:39 Time to invest in tear gas stocks.

45 2018-10-21 23:35:00 I try to view Arizona commits as if they are ASU commits. Would I be nervous/jealous/impressed if they were committed to ASU? Sumlin’s recruiting portfolio is filled with volatile small cap stocks that haven’t been around for very long. He’s gotta diversify that
46 2018-10-21 23:34:47 worse, there were some "oh, uh oh" dips in the market last week, one just before market close on friday

if I had any money I would order shorts on tech stocks for wgen the market opens tomorrow

early voting starts in some states tomorrow
47 2018-10-21 23:34:25 The government buys the stocks and shares. The sellers of the stocks and shares spend the money on goods and labour. Why else would the sellers want the UK government’s £s?
48 2018-10-21 23:30:32 We are gonna make a killing on pot stocks...lololol
49 2018-10-21 23:30:10 I think. Spending 500k AED on Emaar stocks will be a win situation compared to buying a 1 million appartment. As the share price will probabaly rise to more than 2 times. Thanks to the decline in the stock price now.
50 2018-10-21 23:29:40 Someone tell me good pharmaceutical stocks to buy
51 2018-10-21 23:29:05 As of 2013, the top 10% of Americans own 81% of all stock shares.  Top 20% own 92%.  Put another way: Eighty percent of Americans together owned just 8% of all stocks. The bottom half of families owned just under $54,000 in stock.
52 2018-10-21 23:25:08 She has the right approach, banning bump stocks, high capacity magazines, better backgrounds checks!
53 2018-10-21 23:23:35 It’s happening now. Move it to bonds. Stocks go down, bonds go up.
54 2018-10-21 23:22:42 Could it be that a nice correction in stocks in the short run here actually helps the economy in the long run and prevents a recession by slowing things down like rate hikes and GDP growth?
55 2018-10-21 23:21:59 He said on the Oct 1 anniversary of the Las Vegas Massacre that bump stocks would be banned 'in a couple weeks."
56 2018-10-21 23:16:37 Maybe Eric Holder is selling them some. Bump stocks should not be allowed. Getting a fully auto is really hard to get and illegal so creating one with a bump stock is wrong. Ever bought a camo shirt?  “Assault” rifles are regular rifles in camo.
57 2018-10-21 23:15:54 Kung sa pagka incompetence rin lng walang tatalo kay dutae, 2 yrs plng at ito... weak phil currency, down phil stocks, high inflation, high commodity price, bukbukin rice, imported galunggong, food crisis, bombings, EJK, billions of govt project went to Calida, bong go, etc.
58 2018-10-21 23:15:16 A fundamental comprehension of this simple truth makes evident blatant thievery & the contemporary colonization/enslavement of Israel by Polish posers to whom the government allocates $11mil daily.

That money is derived from trading us as stocks & Our collective spending power.
59 2018-10-21 23:15:06 @WolfOfWeedST my husband and me have 5900 shares of mpx and 400 of kshb. We are looking for stocks with high upside like big percentage gains. Are these two stocks alright? We have done some in depth research. Just wondering your opinion.
60 2018-10-21 23:11:55 I give. What does Stocks have to do with U.S. debt?
61 2018-10-21 23:11:43 the bud lite ad where the hipster is thrown in the stocks is great.
62 2018-10-21 23:11:24 Just as Mexico and Guatemala doing nothing to stop the #CaravanaDelMigrante. They have not dispersed them, nor send back to home country. These new "consumers" won't help stocks much. In some states new bonds ( debt) will be sold to pay for welfare, hospitals, emergency services
63 2018-10-21 23:09:26 Look on the bright side... All these people need health care, so should be a boost to health care stocks.
64 2018-10-21 23:09:19 @business #DaybreakAsia : U know @HaidiLun analysts are just focusing on Fed rate hikes as a negative for stocks. Nobody but I believes that The balance sheet unwind is gaining traction & adversely impacting financial markets. They'll learn the hardaway!!!
65 2018-10-21 23:09:08 Justin Tucker just missed a PAT. I would like to sell all of my stocks and personal possessions and immediately invest in doomsday preparation.
66 2018-10-21 23:08:23 As I said, it could buy overseas assets. Or it could buy stocks and shares. The existence of money created by government is very helpful to the economy, but the existence of money has nothing to do with whether taxes fund spending or not.
67 2018-10-21 23:07:03 .. the Honduran "migrant caravan" is likely to boost his stocks.
68 2018-10-21 23:05:23 this plays right into my fears about the left. Nanny staters who want to tell me how much soda I can have. They dont care about bump stocks at all. They are budding totalitarians who first need the guns. Only the Bill of Rights protects me.
69 2018-10-21 23:04:00 If the government uses £s to buy stocks and shares then private sector agents are accumulating £s. Either they want one day to spend those £s or they don’t. If they do spend them then the pounds re-enter circulation and are subject to repeated taxation until thet are exhausted.
70 2018-10-21 23:03:34 @FloWrestling UWW add two wieght stocks where two of our best guys where were sitting out could both wrestle they were asking for us to win worlds you can’t add DT and Kyle Dake and expect for us to lose
71 2018-10-21 23:00:34 Actually - THE BEST NUMBERS were after WW2.  So you are lying again.  My 401K tripled under President Obama.  Under you, I watch an unstable & erratic market ex. lost of 2,000 points in 2 weeks.  I have moved my 401K savings to bonds (from stocks) because of your erratic policies
72 2018-10-21 22:59:30 Want to learn a lot about stocks, investing, and the various markets for stocks and bonds? I strongly recommend Ryan Scribner's podcast. A very nice, intelligent, and dedicated young man.
73 2018-10-21 22:56:23 Financial assets abroad. Stocks and shares.
74 2018-10-21 22:55:50 Stocks I've found trading below 2/3 NCAV as of 10/19/18:
BZH; NVFY; TYHT; WLH. 

Long NVFY.

I am not and do not make any recommendations. I am simply sharing information.
75 2018-10-21 22:52:01 Interest rates are rising. Home prices will start falling. Americans invest in 2 things; homes and stocks. What happens if both see price weakness? The "strong economy" narrative is a complete bluff backed by cheap gov money.
76 2018-10-21 22:50:09 dira na ko sa inyo para damo pagkaon hahahaha yieee mauubos na stocks niyo
77 2018-10-21 22:49:59 Lol you don't know shit. Most people are investing in diversified accounts such as emerging markets and other bonds to reduce risk. No one is flat out investing in US Stocks, so looking at the S&P500 isn't an accurate indicator of 401Ks.
78 2018-10-21 22:49:28 Chinese & related stocks has been hammered as of late with weak data from coming from Asia. Lets look at oversold weekly RSI indicator: $FXI 36, $JD 25, $YY 27, $BIDU 34 and $TSM 41. Below 30 considered oversold. Need to see evidence of reversal.
79 2018-10-21 22:45:43 Holding at 2750 is actually bullish for the next few weeks. Dropping it, not so much.
But there is always pot stocks!!

84 2018-10-21 22:37:33 The #ASX is set to open slightly lower with our futures trading lower on Friday night. US Stocks were flat in a fairly muted session following a volatile week. Tech stocks weighed on the index, as @Atlassian was down 14%.
85 2018-10-21 22:37:04 Never understood why people sell off all their stocks when there's a big apocalypse scare like Y2K or 2012. Like dude if civilization collapses....your money is worthless no matter where you had it lol.
86 2018-10-21 22:36:49 Looks like a bunch of shit stocks
87 2018-10-21 22:36:24 Exactly! The lower class (there is no middle class) have no stocks and bonds few have 401 K's and that is only if their employer provides most aren't lucky enough for that! We are trying to feed our families, keep the lights on & pay astronomical housing costs! #VoteBlue
88 2018-10-21 22:34:54 Not interested in pot stocks. Please don’t send anymore.
89 2018-10-21 22:33:50 "Regular investors", those who had control of what stocks were bought. Bush tanked the economy by putting tax-cuts, wars & giveaways to the pharm industry on the nation's credit card.  Obama put those things on the books, which is why some inaccurately claim he exploded the debt.
90 2018-10-21 22:33:44 If you’re a Falcon and you play lame, you’re lame. Your character choice and moonwalks between stocks absolve you of nothing.
91 2018-10-21 22:33:23 Just five stocks (Apple, ExxonMobil, Microsoft, GE, IBM) accounted for 10% of all wealth created for shareholders since 1926-2016. The top 50 stocks accounted for 40%. {Hendrik Bessembinder - “Do stocks outperform Treasury Bills”}
92 2018-10-21 22:32:40 Similar situation when finance minister of Turkey was pitching his reforms and Trump tweeted his sanctions on Turkey mid way through his speech. I can see Saudi Stocks and investments pulling out.
93 2018-10-21 22:30:47 Read: I haven't sold all my Saudi Arabia stocks yet.
94 2018-10-21 22:30:03 Thats so annoying! I hope she re stocks to avoid this issue.

97 2018-10-21 22:26:02 Did you know according to "The Motley Fool"  investors who bought stocks in 1931 -- just prior to a 71% market drop -- would still have broken even in less than five years!
98 2018-10-21 22:25:07 And as a Trump supporter you must like bending over and taking it. I hear stocks on knee pads are way up.
99 2018-10-21 22:22:08 guess who decided to really give up on counting stocks? Yas that's me. Bye life.
100 2018-10-21 22:22:01 Hey man maybe you can tell me how to purchase epuityfeed with out the 14 day trial
101 2018-10-21 22:21:59 Oh I'm not, I'm fine. Stocks going to get hammered again this week. But you really should be careful about what information you trade on, and the claims you make on the internet based on that information.
102 2018-10-21 22:21:40 I would also end up in the stocks because I would definitely enjoy a full-bodied autumnal mead more than a Bud Light.
103 2018-10-21 22:20:40 What stocks did you invest in? This is my new lane, and I’m a novice so learning ways to expand my portfolio is my thing. Right now I have Groupon and Annaly Capital Management

109 2018-10-21 22:16:15 Weed, blockchain, AI, commodities, shorting tech stocks & longing energy companies. Y'all copy cats are welcome!!!
110 2018-10-21 22:13:07 Yeah...our sports teams are the laughing stocks of both sports. It starts with ownership and they don’t have a clue how to run a franchise.
111 2018-10-21 22:12:23 The only way to sustain fish stocks is let the fish grow, with areas not fished at all that get moved around every few years, like fields that you set aside. After the war (and before echo sounders) fish were much bigger in our neck of the woods (Dover Straights), fewer per ton,
112 2018-10-21 22:10:39 Somebody needa buy my stocks fr
113 2018-10-21 22:10:36 Emerging Markets are in turmoil with currencies over the last few dropping substantially... Bank autos and real estate stocks have also drop substantially... This is very bad news for the global market China as well has dropped substantially....
114 2018-10-21 22:08:30 Why didn't you save money? I assume that you entered the workforce around 20 years old. You have had THIRTY years to save money and have a secondary source of income. Many mutual funds and stocks yield 4% or more.
115 2018-10-21 22:08:25 Investing my money into stocks, skincare, and home decor.

118 2018-10-21 22:06:45 Hmmm. Could be a ploy by United for publicity which will inevitably make stocks rise and the Saudis will be pleased it takes away the heat from the journalist story.
119 2018-10-21 22:04:43 We gotta start investing in popcorn stocks!! Sales will be through the roof from here on out!
120 2018-10-21 22:04:26 You tell me.....my 401K is down -2% YTD that means if I had $100 on Jan 1st then I hv $98 today .... BTW only 10% Americans hv 401k sir ..... No stocks No mutual funds. That's how 70% America is. We don't have time to be Republicans or Democrats.we want best for USA.. that's all
121 2018-10-21 22:02:33 And put in stocks.
122 2018-10-21 22:00:49 Republicans need stock market rally so "the dump" can brag.  Wall Street (republicans) pushing people hard to buy stocks.  And market is oversold, meaning professional investors already dumped stocks or bought puts (insurance).  Many companies reporting earnings too.  @DNC

127 2018-10-21 21:55:52 I felt like the anniversary of the deadliest mass shooting in the US came and went quickly and quietly.  Since Stephen Paddock killed 58 people and shot another 422 people at a music concert, some states have bans on bump stocks.  Which won't prevent a similar crime in any way.
128 2018-10-21 21:54:34 Not sure, Eric... the only catalyst for Goviex is the spot price...now DYL doubled in a short time.. maybe John Borshoff is a continuos catalyst? Or Goviex's marketing team, can't sell their stock? The disparity between both stocks in surprising...

133 2018-10-21 21:46:07 Where is the original video? And How do people make those labels on the video? I want to make a version of my friends for chemistry class because our grades are dropping in that class faster than Cube entertainment’s stocks.
134 2018-10-21 21:44:26 I am 62 and working (don't make a whole lot). My husband is on social security. I will stay working until past 66 to earn as much as I can. We have a little saved in the bank and a 401k that is in stocks. The stocks have dropped considerably. I am scared. Counting on SS.

137 2018-10-21 21:42:31 I just started throwing $ into the 457 in September. From Day One it's been going down.  It's mostly linked to Russell stocks - they've been sliding almost daily.  The people crowing saw the big increase after the election. But the past year, it's been much more volatile.

144 2018-10-21 21:36:20 Tech stocks were dojng great, prior to Trump. Stocks are down, lower corporate earnings reporting, trade war with China, now Trump saying he might pull out of nuclear agreement with Russia. Have you people lost your collective minds?

151 2018-10-21 21:30:08 What?!! I am middle class and Trump has helped me huge.  My stocks are up, my business is selling like never before, and the border is being secured.  What more do I need?! You sound like a Democrat who is mad because now he has to go get a job.

But hey, how’s that deficit? A TRILLION dollars coming up soon! It’s gonna take a Dem president to fix it...AGAIN.
155 2018-10-21 21:24:39 Go trade stocks for a while. No money to be made here anytime soon. I left 5% of my assets in crypto, if it breaks up I ll be very glad - don' t get me wrong.

160 2018-10-21 21:20:16 FYI from Kiplinger, over a 90-year span, 96% of all stocks collectively performed no better than a risk-free one-month Treasury bill.

172 2018-10-21 21:06:18 Let's look at the truth. Jobs up, wages down, corp profit up, stocks up. More people working for less money. The rich get richer. Yippee
173 2018-10-21 21:04:55 I got out of uec before the dilution. Upside is capped and management has left a bad taste. Better risk reward out there. Plus when other u stocks ran uec lagged
174 2018-10-21 21:04:23 So, I image the stocks fall from $1.72 to $1.36 has to have had some cover.  My guess is 5.5 mil shares based on volume since the big great announcement on the financial raise.  We shall see.  But if the MOPC conerns are still there then it will remain.  Oddly, did anyone see..

176 2018-10-21 21:02:46 Chinese stocks have lost >30% value since q1'18, primary points of contention being fears of a slowing (industrial) economy, rising debts, + impact of trade war

183 2018-10-21 20:54:18 While 15.5% return is very good, it is less than the S&P 500’s return of 21.8% last year. That is because #family #offices on average only have 28% of their #investments in #stocks. Family offices have awell-diversified portfolio.
184 2018-10-21 20:54:01 More uncertainty with the vast majority of stocks either bear flagging or in the process of making the right side of the "W" pattern. With Chinese economy softening and options traders short gamma and hedging with delta. No clear direction with volatility simmering. Cash is KING!

186 2018-10-21 20:53:02 Not a KC offense. Need to stay ahead of stocks. Esp with Smith's comments about balance with rub
187 2018-10-21 20:51:00 I feel that way but just in general from a creative perspective; like, I don't know what people who don't pursue some sort of creative passion think about. I guess if they're SUPER into stocks and shit it's kinda the same thing to them?
188 2018-10-21 20:49:51 I lost a lot there as well. But remember it’s the economy, it will fluctuate, but it won’t disappear. When you see that coming, move your money to Bonds, they are a lot safer, in the current economy, move it to stocks, preferably into stocks that invests in areas of growth.
189 2018-10-21 20:49:44 If you haven't figured out that the economy is starting to fall down . Housing slow down it's huge. stocks are going down all I can see in the future and you don't have to be a fortune teller another recession

209 2018-10-21 20:29:39 Bulls who fervently cling to the positive seasonality that is getting stronger here often ignore the other "seasonal" influence that gets stronger as the yr comes to an end: tax selling. It can become a drag on those stocks you might want to bargain hunt. $SPX $NDX $IWM

234 2018-10-21 20:03:40 If ECB stops their QE that will be bearish for the dollar &good for gold. Plus if inflation increases then stocks and bonds lose their appeal and commodities will rise.

246 2018-10-21 19:41:44 My soon to be no longer my advisor just put out a buy recommendation on $GAP with some sort of 2020 target, I forget how much. I think he recommends too many stocks. $GAP? I shorted it earlier this year for a few quick bucks. I figured whats the likelyhood it goes way up?
247 2018-10-21 19:41:00 Yes! So true! Same happened to a friend of mine. The company she used to work for 20 years laid her and a lot of employees yet their stocks are increasing! How is this MAGA? I don't think so.
248 2018-10-21 19:40:25 Ok there are literally taxes on sodas as part of that effort, Being 100% organic/GMO free etc is not going to protect you from any genetic issues, or age issues or potential car/industry accidents. Any of those things could bankrupt a person for the rest of their lives.
249 2018-10-21 19:38:57 80% of all Americans own only 8% of stocks
250 2018-10-21 19:38:51 Most pot stocks are like "we are going to dilute the shit out of existing shareholders.?"
251 2018-10-21 19:38:12 I root for the US economy, but it’s hard to not look at the bear market being foreshadowed by industrial, auto, housing, and cyclical stocks and think that a recession can’t happen to a more deserving schmuck than this president.
252 2018-10-21 19:37:37 And when they stop buying back stocks and the market settles or drops, what of those 401K’s then? You think of Wall Street like a casino. You gamble with our futures.
253 2018-10-21 19:37:17 Like me saying you’re not a Republican if you don’t support putting children in cages. 

Just plastering faces of murder victims (whether they be victims of citizens, illegal immigrants, drone attacks, AR-15’s, bump-stocks ...) is not an argument.
254 2018-10-21 19:37:02 Little stock market lesson for the day from the Weird Millionaire:
When someone says they are long on a stock, they mean they believe it will go up in value.
Someone who says they're short, believes the stock will go down.

256 2018-10-21 19:33:36 It’s the start of a new era I believe everything will be tokenised stocks housing commodities and I hope that one day xrp will be the bridge for at least half of all of that
257 2018-10-21 19:33:15 No! They would be suspicious if a black man went to a gun show and purchased a couple of AR-15 rifles and ammunition. Along with several other side arms and bump stocks all sold without a background check and waiting period. I bet he is even followed home and watched in shifts!
258 2018-10-21 19:33:01 I used to have the Score on all day and night. Even during Stocks and Jocks. It's not even an option now. I will sit in silence rather than listen to that mess.
259 2018-10-21 19:32:53 Earlier today I read some article about a guy who achieved “financial independence”. Turns out all you need to do is borrow $200K from your parents and go back to 2008 and buy a boat load of cheap blue chip stocks.

274 2018-10-21 19:17:48 It's "nice" that I have little to do to prepare for the market this week...but also creating some restlessness...its too early to buy and too late to short...at least from my perspective...I own zero stocks for the first time in a long while...

381 2018-10-21 17:37:22 I think that many stocks in the index would absolutely call it a reversal if they were to do so.  But yes, I did ask about the index itself.

404 2018-10-21 17:20:26 Need to be a Trade Machine member to see the details, but essentially this backtested buying a call after earnings, if and only if the company rises 3% or more off of the report.

So:

* Day 1: Earnings
* Day 2: Stock rises 3% (or more)
* End of Day, buy a call.

 Results above

407 2018-10-21 17:16:43 The academic debate regarding value vs growth stocks is a superficial at best because it is based on a false duality.

409 2018-10-21 17:13:36 Brexit is about to crash their economy.

It's no accident, it's part of the plan.

The wealthy .1% will use their massive cash reserves to buy up devalued stocks & real estate, while slashing/privatizing every institution providing services/entitlements.

It worked here in 2008.

434 2018-10-21 16:54:07 Customers aren't "cautious." They're broke. That's what happens when real wages stagnate and you boost stocks and cut corporate taxes in the hopes of making markets appear healthy.

435 2018-10-21 16:53:27 If the market loses faith in a company/sector, it's very difficult to regain that faith in a short time. One should avoid stocks which are always in the news, good or bad. So, while companies may survive, chances are they may not hit their previous peak in the next bull market.

492 2018-10-21 16:04:38 Thanks. Understood your point . But since Ignored stocks can be ignored in future too , so how exactly we need to identify those businesses which hve these potentional of giving great returns.

504 2018-10-21 15:58:37 So beaten that in his advice was people should buy bonds giving 2 to 3% and not buy stocks yielding 5% - 6% .. Very tough .. We are talking of sales when index has just fallen by 10% , imagine if till falls by 50% or 70% .. It is tough like Iphone example
505 2018-10-21 15:58:35 Then why do stocks and market go up over time? And when are we supposed to know when to buy?
506 2018-10-21 15:57:56 Maximum Stock Returns happen when there are Positive Surprises on Long Ignored Stocks..Current Good Stocks are Over Analysed, Story has played out & No Surprises Left. They will give good returns, but not Best Returns.

509 2018-10-21 15:55:01 Huh gotta admit at first I thought, pff trading can't be that hard now been doing this for a while and still does not find consistency in trading stocks.

510 2018-10-21 15:54:26 My prediction is that for the next #uranium bull this spot price Will also double next years. End of 2019 the spot price Can hit $60 from $28 now. Uranium mining #stocks can go x4-x10 next year. Some gems can go even harder!  #crypto type of gains Can be Made! Just my guess..
511 2018-10-21 15:53:31 I guess horrific is relative.  My pharmaceutical stocks are doing pretty ok.

529 2018-10-21 15:38:29 As the world becomes more interesting the future recession becomes more likely. The decline in home sales, autos sales as well as the stock market helps the forecast greatly.

531 2018-10-21 15:38:15 San bhai, the thing I've learnt about MA is that every stock respond to different MAs. When trading stocks in general, cant generalize one particular MA and build a strategy around it. Better to identify the max hits on an MA/EMA/WMA for individual stocks.
532 2018-10-21 15:35:05 It's crazy. I used to use Tungsten shot a few years ago for geese but I've not seen any for about 4 years. At prices like these, I'm not surprised no one stocks it.

559 2018-10-21 15:11:44 What is a mutual fund? Think of people with a lot of money opening a folder. They put securities (stocks, etc) that they believe in inside. They put the folder on the stock market. You buy "shares"of it. This spreads out your risk, but it has management fees. #stocks #funds
560 2018-10-21 15:11:20 Apart from the indexers, most people own only a fraction of the universe of available stocks => most of those independent decision makers conclude most of the time that most stocks are over priced at any given moment.  :-)

634 2018-10-21 14:01:28 I've seen many people excited about this but they're not exactly the kind of people expressing about it on social networks, forums and reading them even less.

Marketing will be the main factor here. In France Nintendo already have more stocks for it than for Sun/Moon back then!
635 2018-10-21 13:59:37 Nor is the decline of the housing stocks going to doom the stock market. No one was in them! You need speculation to lead to contagion. Social media and tech is where it is at
636 2018-10-21 13:59:04 Alas, We're an expat family who has always given @QualityStreetUK tins for holiday gifts (including to ourselves), have found one store here in #Minneapolis that regularly stocks but really wish I could find a way to get the pick & mix! It is a dream come true.
637 2018-10-21 13:58:51 After introduction of LTCG TAX stock market has never picked up. Only few good stocks were moving now they also crashed.
638 2018-10-21 13:56:30 Hell, Trump even wants banning of bump stocks. That's an infringement.
639 2018-10-21 13:54:19 My prediction for @bbcdoctorwho ep3 in which we meet US civil rights-era icon Rosa Parks: visiting the TARDIS, Rosa discovers that the biscuit dispenser also stocks various brands of chocolate - dark, milk, white. She sends one to MLK, who is moved to declare "I have a Dream®".
640 2018-10-21 13:53:16 Updated my Mac, and yet again @apple have just added crap that I don't need. Be cool if we could just remove it, I don't need stocks, I don't need home, and I don't need voice memos.

642 2018-10-21 13:47:47 Trump's America:

-43% cuts to education
-Tax revenues down 22%
-Individual taxes increased by 1%
-Removed environmental / consumer protections
-Financial stocks: record highs
-Production: record lows
-Private & public debt: record highs

& if you choose 10 stocks probability of winners very less here.

Mcap from 10000 C to 50000 C:
Requires: Commonsense, Simplicity & discipline.

& Probability of winners more here.
644 2018-10-21 13:45:22 It's not like their opinion matters anyway...

I mean the japanese retailers stated this week that the interest over these games strongly increased recently, the LGPE bundle is out of stocks in Canada..etc..It'll sell without them.

Remember the hatred over Ultra SM, they failed.
645 2018-10-21 13:45:08 I know. But it's annoying. And they are extrapolating a 40% decline in builder stocks with somehow dooming the economy. That it is the canary in the coal mine. But it is not.
646 2018-10-21 13:45:05 (2/2) I invest when I believe the conditions... are probably not permanent... you can't be short-term oriented with this investment philosophy. If you're going to worry about short-term volatility, you're just not going to be able to buy the cheapest stocks. -- Rich Pzena

651 2018-10-21 13:38:37 This is indeed one of the good stocks :) i currently also have an eye on $clsd, $ovid and $htbx. All of those have some good potential to make some profit in tange of 10 to 100+ %

655 2018-10-21 13:34:53 Stocks are just buyout offers split up into bits; if you aren’t operating it, you’re looking to trade it for an eventual buyout.

If the company is operating (let’s hope they are...) & are profitable, why do they sell company bits?

672 2018-10-21 13:21:13 nothing of that sort ! ... just look at indicator ... lower the volumes ... bigger the runs if the stock is under valued ... is the same take as with Volatility .. most shy away from Volatility ... there are hordes of traders making money on BSE stocks .. even without volumes..!

683 2018-10-21 13:10:09 Right at the start they said no deal is better than bad deal.  Then we've all found out there was only ever 3 deals on the table hard soft or no.  Totally ripped off. Cameron needs to be found and put in the stocks
684 2018-10-21 13:08:29 Technical doesn't work on low volume stocks, isn't it?
685 2018-10-21 13:07:29 They didn’t though. 80% of the tax breaks went back into buying stocks. They didn’t create jobs. How many times do we have to learn the hard way that trickle down economics does not work?
686 2018-10-21 13:06:41 It's as simple as that, an unsuccessful businessman of a highly successful father & brother knows his stocks are dipping everyday & with govt by his side can only think of stifling the media! But,that's the reality when most of media are singing his praises(?!) Everyday!!

688 2018-10-21 13:03:25 Do you know how much time it takes to transfer stocks from a bank to   another just to be able to sell them or whatever purpose? (Of course you   know: months or weeks) On Eth, 1-2 mins. YOUR pain and suffering is  understandable: You are falling down from your ivory tower.
689 2018-10-21 13:02:18 One of the biggest myth in the financial market: The stocks only react to bad news/ rumor. No they don't react to a rumour. So, Please don't believe in this BS. When a trend takes shape, they will believe anything that supports the trend.
690 2018-10-21 13:01:59 No doubt abt it. N no second thought. Some stocks are gem for life.
691 2018-10-21 12:54:03 Doesn't the US allow FoM among its states? The EU wants to have something similar. We don't surrender fishery rights anywhere, but have rules that will allow fish stocks to continue to exist.

You forget the US has very aggressive extraterritorial rules on sanctions.

697 2018-10-21 12:45:58 Generally the way he operates is he is long the market across various equities, but will put on a huge asymmetric macro bet like Chinese FX devaluation using customized derivatives contracts. He shoots for 10% returns in stocks less 1% or so for macro bet carry cost. Then waits.
698 2018-10-21 12:45:44 It can be applied to stocks & other index as well or only nifty?

700 2018-10-21 12:45:07 (1/2) When I talk about the companies I invest in, you'll be able to rattle off hundreds of bad things about them - but that's why they're cheap! The most common comment I get is 'Don't you read the paper?' Because if you read the paper, there's no way you'd buy these stocks.

703 2018-10-21 12:39:09 Of course he doesn't work for free. He advertises his properties constantly, tells foreign dignitaries to stay in the Trump International Washington hotel and probably gives nods and winks to others to buy and sell stocks according to his tweets about specific corporations.

715 2018-10-21 12:23:26 Exactly. I am quite happy to be on the losing side. It's the manner in which we got there. Ironic, for you guys Trump has empowered autocrats, subsidised the rich. Now stocks r  whilst budget deficit is growing. In UK we r just flatlining. They weren't right anyway. Whoopee. 
716 2018-10-21 12:22:10 They were unhappy that another online only supermarket, who stocks some of our lines came out publicly in support of trans ppl, they then signed up with us and are kicking off about the poster being removed in case my supermarket also support trans ppl. It's so sad.

843 2018-10-21 09:04:38 Not always. My take is that one need not always resort to profit booking in good stocks. But, you definitely need to keep close track of the companies you own, however good they may be.

846 2018-10-21 08:59:38 Yes. QE is an financial asset swap. The APF buys up gilts in the secondary market, so the private sector sells it less liquid financial assets (gilts) in return for liquid cash. It then invests these money balances in other assets such as stocks and shares etc.

853 2018-10-21 08:51:32 For more developed areas!it will be less maybe 3%, you have to look at more sector specific stocks e.g utilities will pay high div yield, but they don’t move in price as much. So it’s the usual theme really the more riskier the equities, the higher div yield you can expect. 1/2

876 2018-10-21 08:16:07 80:20 rule comes back in markets!

80% time stocks move in a sensible p/e range dancing to their earnings tune. We are in that ‘normal ‘ period.

2017 was deemed ‘new normal’ but it’s never different in markets!!

Hold good quality stocks for many years and with luck you’ll do

880 2018-10-21 08:08:06 All that money goes to wealthy arms dealers & their families that own their stocks. Very little of that money ends up in the hands of hard working Americans. The arms belong to off shore companies. Not America! Follow the money.

897 2018-10-21 07:42:50 Market cap of a coin is thinking too small, works for stocks, crypto is still in its infancy, still hasn't stretched it's legs yet

People thought XRP couldn't hit a dollar, it hit almost 4 dollars
898 2018-10-21 07:42:28 Agree with you but do you think story is going to change for stocks like Gillette, 3M India, ITC, HDFC Bank, NESTLE, P&G, Kotak Bank, Pidilite. They can easily compound for a decade or more @ 15 to 20 percent or more?
899 2018-10-21 07:41:31 Just like most other stocks it will dump after the news about the conference fades away and will pump on new major news imho
900 2018-10-21 07:39:02 Nifty Puts will never pe proper hedge for stock longs as stocks fall like pack of cards anywhere between 10-70% instead if someone is long he should keep a strict stoploss and if triggered he should wait. Sitting on cash also is a position for people who cannot go short

904 2018-10-21 07:31:25 Only thing which you can control is behaviour. In panic just go and double the amount which you normally used to buy. Buy existing good business no new idea. Remember out of 8000 stocks only 100 managed to become large cap. I am not brilliant so I ll buy hdfc, reliance etc.

~Trust your system, finetune it but NEVER hop to another one
~AVOID learning new stream of TA if the present one is adequate

Also beware of people pushing stocks like that, they might also do the same.
1006 2018-10-21 04:54:50 The market is unpredictable. You can either buy the news or sell the news. Look at the tables from the top companies in cannabis. The stocks are going down. If you don’t know how to read the chart, YouTube it.

1010 2018-10-21 04:47:01 Social security has been incredibly successful in keeping 22 million retirees out of poverty. The Stock Market has lost a lot of people a lot of money, including people who don't even invest in stocks, becuase the market cratered the economy. This isn't rocket science.
1011 2018-10-21 04:46:23 why is @msnbc afraid of beto?
could it be their corp owners support the opposition candidate?
could that have anything to do with their precious stocks in fossil fuels? 
could it be that @BetoORourke has not sold out to pac $$
- always about money when corporations OWN THE NEWS.
1012 2018-10-21 04:44:52 They go to penny stocks. Now isn’t the time to invest in cannabis stocks since you can probably get them cheaper over time on the dip. Why spend the money for each share when you can get them dollars cheaper over time, all cannabis stocks aren’t doing too well.
1013 2018-10-21 04:44:22 @agurevich23 Hi Alex, feels like we at point where rate hikes are hitting stocks. From your book my understanding is that at some point in the near future you go long curve flattening or just outright long rates? Are there any perfect trades at this point that you can see?

Countries - if going to have capital gains taxes index for inflation.

Use financial transactions taxes on stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc when bought and sold

Move towards sales taxation based on harm caused and wealth of person making purchase.
1053 2018-10-21 03:27:16 Love me some canopy $CGC , I bet they will be the 1st in the industry to pay a dividend. It’s definitely too soon now, but all other vice stocks pay divies, just forward thinking fwiw

1055 2018-10-21 03:23:31 Nearly 35 of Nifty stocks below 200DMA

Larger universe almost 70-80% below it

US mkts weak after long time 

So the learning is it will take good time for the recovery to happen, which will eventually happen

Don’t rush to buy.

Keep a watchlist ready 

Buy staggered way
1056 2018-10-21 03:21:21 I’m curious as well, but  currently I keep my trade dollar amount consistent, so that my wins/losses stay relatively consistent. I try and trade stocks that have similar relative support/resistance levels so that I cut losses at about the same percentage change. Kinda works

1068 2018-10-21 03:09:07 hey Red, yeah I agree this is not a viable solution to the problem of mass shootings. It's doing something just for the sake of doing something. If bump stocks are not used in crimes, what is banning them going to accomplish?
1069 2018-10-21 03:08:32 Infuriating.

1072 2018-10-21 03:03:01 Your talking about investing in cannabis earlier, only 22 symbols in the market. The dip is still going, no one even knows if they are going to go up. Canada legalized weed, they thought stocks would sky rocket but it didn’t. People are waiting for it to drop lower.
1073 2018-10-21 03:00:07 I am now ready to take your questions regarding stocks, just tweet me the name of the company.  No direct messages, please! @thinkervenu

1081 2018-10-21 02:51:13 I have a backtested momentum strategy which captures some of them (HEG and bharatrasayan for example), these stocks are pretty much the top performers on NSE.
1082 2018-10-21 02:50:37 Agree...but one important thing we have learned this month is that #Bitcoin is large enough to be viewed as a "risk" asset with positive correlation to #Stocks $SPY with equities are tanking. Any $BTC forecast is probably contingent on what happens to other risk assets.
1083 2018-10-21 02:50:06 Few of the index stocks are holding well. Index management at it's best. Ab ki baar modi ji karenge chamatkar!
1084 2018-10-21 02:48:37 But if u have invested in all the wrong stocks then it's foolish to keep Faith alive ...  Many small and mid caps may not recovered one has to be congnizent of that.

1103 2018-10-21 02:25:40 Calling a tax law a "scam" - which means fraud - is an insult (disrespectful and scornful) as well as inaccurate.

1135 2018-10-21 01:36:25 Check the conversations.  The only talk I shared was about "certainties in baseball are never certain."
I'm not engaging in your "my team vs your team" bs
1136 2018-10-21 01:33:17 So your saying high capacity clips are part of bump stocks??  Can’t have it both ways.
1137 2018-10-21 01:32:25 said that in the last year instead of owning 25 stocks he has reduced to 8 or so and just owns the best of the best.  So, he said he owns UEC, Gold Mining Inc and now is the biggest shareholder of URC.  That seems like pretty good faith.  Has he changed due to recent dilution?
1138 2018-10-21 01:30:18 Started drinking and looked at my stocks, that $PLAG halt got me all kinds of fucked up again.

Stock will free fall and fucking SEC don’t blink an eye

Someone starts banking on a runner and “whoa shit we better look into this”

Cmon SEC let her run.

1146 2018-10-21 01:19:13 The Euro is on the verge of collapse, it’s debatable if it will see the year out.Many countries &individuals r about 2 loose out.That’s why Italy is selling stocks to Switzerland,so that’s Cyprus,Greece,Italy,Spain, Ireland,Portugal in massive problems,NO MONEY 2 Bail out in EU
1147 2018-10-21 01:18:18 The FS Investors / Soccer City hasn't financed or build anything over the last 10-15yrs.  At least SDSU has a track record of financing & building projects worth close to $1 Billion over the last 2 decades. FS is a hedge funds co which buy stocks & properties & resell for profit.
1148 2018-10-21 01:17:53 It's TIME retail investors, who have been dudded on $ASX shitty stocks, started to become shareholder activists.
It's NOT by bad Luck that you lost your money 
BUT by DESIGN.
By the @ASX set up, it's lack of diligence and the people who manipulate it.
1149 2018-10-21 01:16:48 2 - The things I talk about or want to see  legislated are not aimed at them. They, in fact, support the basic ideas  that should be laws:
 No AR-15's and DEFINITELY no bump stocks,
 Universal Federal background checks. That is, no selling them off the table at a gun show.

1152 2018-10-21 01:06:05 The next 40% should be in index or target date funds. It’s only the top 10% who really have the resources to pick individual stocks, and if we gamble and lose, who cares?
1153 2018-10-21 01:02:24 We do not have a tax problem, we have a spending problem. Look at the debt under Obama, total disaster.  You do not have to own stocks, 401k's benefit also. When the markets are doing well everyone does. Unemployment is a perfect example of that.

1157 2018-10-21 00:53:05 indexes do over the long term because the small percent of the stocks that produce the bulk of stock market returns are in the indexes at some point. 2/2
1158 2018-10-21 00:52:47 Stock market indexes do not buy & hold they have a process for stocks entering & leaving based on specific metrics. Indexes are not passive at their source, they are managed. They end up getting rid of losers & letting their winners run. Buy and hold does not work, the 1/2

1164 2018-10-21 00:46:18 It doesn’t make sense to blame capitalism for a lot of the issues in America. Money brings order and standardization. If we didn’t have money, we wouldn’t have stocks, international markets, trading, or precise valuation. That’s like blaming the mirror for self-image issues

1167 2018-10-21 00:43:44 Actually, exactly wrong.  Spending creates jobs. Demand creates jobs. Giving money to people who don't need to spend it results in them putting the money into savings vehicles such stocks and bonds.  And no, once the IPO is over, buying and selling securities doesn't create jobs.

1174 2018-10-21 00:31:52 Rich people now a days just buy back stocks of their own company in large volumes. It’s a 2 fold really, one, it makes them worth more money if they own a bigger percentage of their own Corp, and two, it inflated the market to make it look like things are going really well.

1188 2018-10-21 00:09:33 Does that sound reasonable to you, if conservatives are really that evil, wouldn't we, as "gun nuts" just kill liberals wholesale until nobody dared admit to being liberal, your retirement depends on a corporations stocks doing well. Try taking to an actual conservative sometime

1192 2018-10-21 00:04:53 As an older midwestern Scandinavian, normally this would be appalling. Now I’m thinking public shaming is called for with this lot of grifters, liars and sycophants. How about bringing back the stocks? Tossing rotten food?
1193 2018-10-21 00:03:02 A well balanced portfolio should include:

1. Diversified Blue Chip Stocks. 

2. Real Estate. 

3. PRO Forex Traders with proven track records!

1262 2018-10-20 22:46:44 The GOP’s tax cuts for the 1% will cause another recession in this country. What CEO’s did with those tax cut did nothing for the increase of wages at the bottom.  Some tossed “a bone” of a bonus to the “worker bees” & the rest went into buying back their stocks.

1272 2018-10-20 22:33:57 You endorsed trump who said gun owners shouldn’t have due process before gun seizure, supports the Clinton ban, LIED that it was on “assault weapons”, gave a fortune to anti 2A politicians including Hillary, and who want to use regulation to ban bump stocks. You are anti-gun!
1273 2018-10-20 22:31:10 Simple - no need for assault rifles of any type among civilians, and ban bump stocks. If you need a high capacity mag rifle to take someone down, you’re a lousy shot. Plus you sure don’t need a semi-rifle to shoot a deer or razor back.
1274 2018-10-20 22:30:05 Thanks for all the posts. Still not sure some of these guys are not using such forums to front run (never disclosing their key picks)to gain followership.

1275 2018-10-20 22:29:07 Yeah, but you know that the company that makes the weapons is most likely a huge contributor to re-election fund, don't you? Or, if it's a public company, the family owns stocks in it. It's all about money. Their money. Not ours.

1318 2018-10-20 21:24:25 I have a hypothesis (not 100% tested yet): it's easier to make money trading in bearish market. Stocks go down faster than they go up so shorts and especially puts can bring in some big winners with less risk.

1347 2018-10-20 20:46:11 No. Homeowners cost is foregone return on their equity. Easily could have rented and placed equity into the stock market.  If prices rise and nominal stock prices rise, should we not provide a COLA because many retires have stocks? What you spend is imputed rents, which rose.

1389 2018-10-20 19:41:04 This is all very scary stuff! Money over humanity seems to be a growing theme the deeper I dive into politics. 

I hope we can fight this stuff effectively. I don't want to see the day where lives are traded like stocks.
1390 2018-10-20 19:40:50 I am with $GOLD. Do your own DD on gold related stocks. You might find some hidden gems there as it is the cheapest asset class currently.

1392 2018-10-20 19:37:12 This earnings season stocks reporting misses and guide downs sell down because growth expectations get crushed, stocks reporting beats and raises sold because they are liars and naïve.
1393 2018-10-20 19:35:56 Yes, during our live shows we do ya not only on #Crypto but also sector related traditional stocks. $SQ is one our software has been nailing. We gave a strong buy after the market sell off last week.
1394 2018-10-20 19:35:46 I think people will be surprised. Stocks will rally in 2019 another 10-20%...I think 2020 will be a disaster, however. Which would be terrible timing given the US election.
1395 2018-10-20 19:33:11 Corporate Executives are  dumping their companies stocks.  This is a sign stock market may tank.  There are times when stocks did not recover for many year (like stocks did in 2008 when they dropped  50%)
1396 2018-10-20 19:33:08 #IWantToGetPaidTo exist. That's what happened when you collect #dividends via dividend stocks, right @JasonFieber?
1397 2018-10-20 19:33:05 Correct. But none of that is a deal breaker or a significant trade barrier. Look at supermarket food stocks from Asia, Africa and South America. There will be winners and losers from change. Focus on being a winner. Bye.
1398 2018-10-20 19:32:51 that's true or invest in all the stocks that have went off in the last 10 years
1399 2018-10-20 19:32:05 Regarding @jimcramer claim that US winning trade war due to China market decline:"Stocks remain a curiosity in China accounting for 4% household wealth"says Vivian Lin Thurston, China equity analyst for William Blair Investment Management. @SquawkCNBC @andrewrsorkin @BeckyQuick
1400 2018-10-20 19:31:43 It's a faff finding anywhere that actually stocks them where you can actually look at them!
1401 2018-10-20 19:30:07 In other news bounty’s stocks go through the roof! Jfc the mess
1402 2018-10-20 19:28:26 Kill debts first, then get a car, new desktop rig and drawing tablet. Probably go back to college, then possibly invest in stocks. I'm at that point in life where big issues come first, then I can play when they're over and done with.
1403 2018-10-20 19:28:03 Oh fuck it we invested hella stocks then

1409 2018-10-20 19:22:47 So Iowa doesn't like the jobs, increases in 401ks, stocks, etc?
1410 2018-10-20 19:18:44 I don’t follow the market that much any more, although I use to trade heavily at times, and over decades, in individual stocks. I stay away basically because I try and find lows and avoid highs. This is one of those valuation extreme times I choose to avoid.
1411 2018-10-20 19:18:04 Why don't you mind your own business & go back to calling your little penny stocks? This convo is actually relevant to me until guys like you drop by & talk utter nonsense without any real input to the convo (zero relevance) - at least BB brings something to the table. Fuck off
1412 2018-10-20 19:16:02 I ll stick with #natgas and my #MJ stocks ))) $BAT is the only coin I’m faithful to 
1413 2018-10-20 19:10:08 Yes got in and out very quickly! Ty

1415 2018-10-20 19:07:29 Would this be the same Rick Scott who held stocks in firms that did business with the Maduro regime in Venezuela?
1416 2018-10-20 19:07:27 Every week, my aunt stocks up on croissants and avocados for me... so yeah I’m probably never moving out
1417 2018-10-20 19:04:11 It isn't normal but a bit of normal now some ups & downs. I was very nervous when it keep going up & up. It is way over priced. EPS suck unless in more risky stocks. $ General doubled in price but dividends around 1%, It's low risk so can't expect a lot but surely more than that.
1418 2018-10-20 19:03:51 Ever notice on TD  thinkorswim. Some times as soon as I buy the asking price, on a uptrend stock, the market all of a sudden turns on  you. New Policy cross check with other platforms finviz OTO Yahoo. One day hope to buy in on stocks to trade or other
1419 2018-10-20 18:58:26 Our current market is anything but normal atm if you ask me. All financial assets are highly overvalued. For instance, look at the PE10 ratio in stocks- price/(10yr avg earnings) adjusted for the tax rate is probably over ‘07 or 2000 rate.

1421 2018-10-20 18:54:11 Can we not bring back public hangings and stocks? 
I would say throw off a building, chop heads off but they are familiar with it. 

How about solitary for life with one song played on loop from Justin bieber
1422 2018-10-20 18:52:07 Main reason traders lost is  trading is their career & need to cycle $ .They can't hold like stocks like Buffet or Cramer even though they know  the probability of companies like $msft $googl going bankrupt is small. So some end up chasing for a win to make a buck and lost all

1427 2018-10-20 18:49:08 Big guys already done that twice. They'll do it again, they know all the ropes. Luckily Bitcoin (and crypto in general) can be "recycled" that way and have much shorter market cycles than traditional stocks. We won't be waiting too long to retire.:)
1428 2018-10-20 18:49:05 My sister stocks our bathroom with toilet paper even when I’m the bitch who finished it and forgot to bring more WHY IS SHE SUCH A SAINT I DIE
1429 2018-10-20 18:46:25 I think market starting 2 appear a bit more normal. Stocks are way over prices due to buy-backs. Even with fed raising rates a bit,tax cuts giving corp enof $ to continue buy back. For instance,Clorox up $15. Why in the world such an increase,long established market
1430 2018-10-20 18:46:05 Finally got my computer to mine Monero.  Got a hash rate of 500, did the math and realized at that rate, I'd be getting about four cents of profit per day.  I'm better off staying with stocks.
1431 2018-10-20 18:45:12 $CRMD  I am doing my daily updates on all my stocks 191 of them now might get too this today or tomorrow but as alway ur going to love it
1432 2018-10-20 18:42:39 I want STEEL stocks.
1433 2018-10-20 18:41:07 @cvpayne How do I pick STEEL stocks?
1434 2018-10-20 18:39:15 this is one of my biggest problems in crypto. I can’t define a fair price at all $ or btc. Most stocks I bought, I still hodl, most of them for a a couple years, cause I always check the investment case. Probably crypto’ is different, maybe I just have to look at it another way
1435 2018-10-20 18:37:49 The stock example is inapt because you don’t use stocks.
1436 2018-10-20 18:37:39 I also believe there needs to be a national ban on things like bump stocks and a limit set on the number of rounds of ammo someone can purchase at once. (And I wouldn't say you should have a right to an AR-15.)
1437 2018-10-20 18:37:34 @AndrewPollackFL I’m a father,but can only imagine the horror of losing your child.Inaction of Fla. Repub. dominated legislatura & Gov. Scott was a factor.Only AFTER the tragedy,they raised minimum age for all gun purchases to 21,created 3 day waiting period & banned bump stocks.
1438 2018-10-20 18:37:21 What stocks are we looking at for short term plays?
1439 2018-10-20 18:36:08 Saudis openly fund head-chopping terror-mercenaries, flagrantly violate human rights at home, mass murder 10s of thousands of innocents in #Yemen etc. but they rollover their billions of petrodollars into US stocks & weapons.
1440 2018-10-20 18:35:35 Tgey embezzled 40+56 Billion dollars .. of which 30-40 Billion is lying somewhere intact .in stocks businesses and cash .. they shld cough up at least 30-50 billion .. before tgey are let off into the sunset ..
1441 2018-10-20 18:34:43 Mania stocks are no longer reporting earnings... they are reporting buybacks... and buybacks are booming...
1442 2018-10-20 18:33:38 Pretty sure u can invest $5000 a month as well.  Or save enough to do real estate, stocks and other investments.  Just live more than 10 yrs and you're already ahead.  Unless you are 65 then the million is the priority
1443 2018-10-20 18:33:23 honestly I don't know shit about stocks and I would want to invest on something that's tangible so I would do real estate lol
1444 2018-10-20 18:32:52 Any good stocks/etfs to invest in uranium here in the us?
1445 2018-10-20 18:32:22 And Stocks v Bonds normally have an inverse relationship. But I’ve played markets and found that one should never get caught up in daily movements (unless of course the Dow drops a few k points). But we in a situation that has no comparison, and I’m very concerned.
1446 2018-10-20 18:31:09 Thanks for your reply. I‘m used to invest in stocks but was thrilled by the possibilities of crypto’s technology. I invested a part of my stock budget and still try to figure out how to do the best research for good future companies. Will farther have a Look at your posts
1447 2018-10-20 18:30:26 There are 1254 stocks on AIM and 2600 on the LSE and I can honestly say I don’t post on any I don’t hold shares in.  You only comment on shares you have a vested interest in. The boards should look at device reputation by iovation as that would make it more difficult for them

1449 2018-10-20 18:29:09 I was playing a game in green and all of the sudden it hits red and I lose 2 stocks and then turns green like 1 minute later
1450 2018-10-20 18:28:50 And stocks lmao like y’all were saying!
1451 2018-10-20 18:28:26 Broooo where did u get these stocks at? 
1452 2018-10-20 18:23:26 Lmao nah I figured, nigga said stocks
1453 2018-10-20 18:23:03 I am stalking a shorts in individual stocks. I'm not really interested in shorting Indexes as I'm looking for bigger % flops. 

It's a lose lose posting my short ideas, as FinTwit gets pissy when you post bearish charts about them. Tells you all you need to know about sentiment
1454 2018-10-20 18:21:14 Nowhere. Where in the Constitution are nuclear weapons, arms deals with Saudi murderers, APCs for police officers, riot squads for Native American protesters, bump stocks for the mentally ill, tax shelters 4 mobsters, Citizens United, or plea bargains forced on the poor?
1455 2018-10-20 18:20:31 There seems to match what occurs with stocks in the sky all day long.
1456 2018-10-20 18:19:55 10 yr over 3%. Interest must be paid. 10 yr bonds older w lower rate will sell at auction at discount. There is no virtual zero on a Treasury bill. Watch market,seems stabilizing a bit but bonds up,stocks up too often. Not normal. If one is up,other sh b down.
1457 2018-10-20 18:19:54 But sadly no supercharging for india, they want to clear the stocks for old 9v 2amp chargers.
1458 2018-10-20 18:18:54 And see the result all stocks are down 60-70 percent. And the prices won’t come back any soon. All of a sudden u realised buy on dips is the strategy. For the past eight years u were silent on it. God save investors who are watching channels.
1459 2018-10-20 18:17:29 Rather than trading specific individual stocks I invested in ETF’s that will represent the movement of the market. The ETF’s are less volatile than the individual stocks that comprise them, making them less vulnerable to noise-trader risk. #rpiFTI

1461 2018-10-20 18:16:18 Sir especially for u in the nineth year of the bull market u realised it’s a buy on dips market. This pattern was there for the eight other years as well. I did tweet u about it earlier as well. It was a clear sign u were luring people into buying stocks on dips.
1462 2018-10-20 18:16:09 But if this were a rising rates sell off, how come dividend stocks have performed fairly ok?
Call it a hunch, I think it's more related with gpd growth expectations in the US.
1463 2018-10-20 18:13:43 stocks rise by 1%.

1467 2018-10-20 18:10:39 That and a lot of stocks are getting cheaper which means higher starting yield!
1468 2018-10-20 18:05:57 Obviously you did not own stocks, which fell 50% in value...worldwide! Great that you were protected in that kind of bubble. Even our CPP investment fund lost millions of dollars...because it is comprised of.....equities.

1470 2018-10-20 18:05:01 Trashing investments, esp. IRAs, is helping destroy any economic gains you advertise. Don't know who or what is behind it all this year, but suggest you find out and reverse it. Stop gloating because until this is corrected you look foolish/majority of stocks at or near yr. lows
1471 2018-10-20 18:03:27 I would like to ask their opinion on some stocks I'm intrested in.

1473 2018-10-20 18:02:46 Start a campaign to have anyone who plays 4-5-1 put in the stocks and pelted with fruit
1474 2018-10-20 18:02:11 Your other friend is right. And the point behind doing it is that by buying into a mutual fund, instead of just buying small amounts of single stocks on your own, diversifies your risk. Making it way more unlikely that you lose money on the investment.

1484 2018-10-20 17:54:04 DSONIC & MYEG share prices were hit by the news of charges against Zahid Hamidi. This could be an opportunity to accumulate the stocks on weakness as MACC confirmed that MYEG is not a party to the investigation & DSONIC had won the previous contract via open tender.

1501 2018-10-20 17:36:26 If someone had said to me a decade ago that we’d be at sub 4% unemployment, stocks at over 25k and 3.0% GDP growth I’d at least have thought Americans would be feeling good. Might be time to ask what are we even measuring and does it really matter?

1516 2018-10-20 17:17:48 Well Kevin, you may not want to head down to the pumpkin patch to get some pumpkins, because it looks like there’s a rather large grrr front moving in, which could lead to some grrr weather. I’d keep a grrr jacket handy.
And now to @TheWhiteRose014, with stocks.
1517 2018-10-20 17:16:39 Yes and it's not good news...

I arrived to know of this now a short time ago.

We're screwed if this is an indicator of the health of stocks...

1519 2018-10-20 17:15:03 FWIW, I recognize your thesis on rates.
My rebuttal would be (1) an endless supply with the deficits and (2) reduction of Fed BS at same time.
That they weren’t up 2 points to me says something is different and we could see a bonds and stocks  at the same time.

1524 2018-10-20 17:11:59 Last time in the summer of 2015, it was just the stock market... this time it is double barreled, stocks and real estate both dropping... last time gov't intervened in the stock market, but this time they can't touch the R.E. market though, long cycle disaster is underway.

1528 2018-10-20 17:09:09 Also: The Saudis are key in maintaining the US $ as world reserve currency. Nixon/Kissinger made a deal in 73: support Israel & rollover petrodollars into US stocks & US weapons systems. They dutifully oblige. If they don't... regime change
1529 2018-10-20 17:08:55 I know the economy is booming. The economy numbers for stocks etc aren’t  a reflection on the regular people, middle class housing is up, food up, gas up etc. money is flowing. At the top level.

1534 2018-10-20 17:03:08 And waste their savings on penny stocks. Also, none of these authorities show the same vigor against lotto or penny stocks. Really sad.
1535 2018-10-20 17:02:50 On the #NSE, as many as 859 stocks have recorded a low this year which is lower than low of 2017. 515 stocks have blown through the low of 2016, 381 have stamped a low lower than that seen in 2015. One hell of incredible damage this year has been.

1539 2018-10-20 16:59:09 I'll probably ditch the bonds and go full stocks over $1000 once we have 2x the out-of-pocket maximum in there (next year, hopefully). But until then, I want the account to have the best chance of maintaining the balance even in a severe downtown.

1550 2018-10-20 16:40:51 It must be the same with hot cross buns and Easter eggs too that have slowly appearing in the stores its crazy. I know my dad usually stocks up with xmas puds so he can eat them through out the year  I saw the other day Sainsbury's brought out Brussel sprout tea wtf
1551 2018-10-20 16:40:46 But that's part of it, isn't it? -- how do stocks get to be "biggest", and what are the resulting pressures on businesses? The ownership stays diluted either way, it seems to me.
1552 2018-10-20 16:40:42 Unless boring stocks like $WMT $PEP $PG etc start trading extremely bullish the market is in a cautionary phase because the sentiment shift  that is occurring in growth stocks (see $NFLX last week) isn’t just going to shift back  overnight. These turns take time.

I heard first hand at UP 2 weeks ago.
1561 2018-10-20 16:33:41 Maybe I phrased it poorly. I mean, you wouldn't think that those stocks are up that much, right? It doesn't feel like it if you think about how this year have been (subtle). It's not normal to have those returns in 6-8M and when you look at the charts it's obv. they took a leg
1562 2018-10-20 16:33:30 Agreed - any improvement in the economy and there are stocks that will go up plenty

1573 2018-10-20 16:26:24 What spending cuts do you propose? Trump is spending money like a drunken sailor and the deficit is spiraling out of control.

The stock market is NOT unrelated. Stocks are affected by politics to some degree ...
1574 2018-10-20 16:26:10 ISTM that the rise of passive investing has mostly mitigated the moral hazard there. Rather than wanting to make it actively go up I just pick a cap-weighted portfolio of the 100, or 500, or 2000 biggest stocks in a market and wait, or more likely I buy Fidelity’s product to do
1575 2018-10-20 16:25:39 So what was the stocks name?

1586 2018-10-20 16:14:23 That's because you generally do it in Stocks where you are well aware of how the stock has behaved after past Earnings.
1587 2018-10-20 16:13:03 At what risk level?

You're better off taking the lump sum and putting it in stocks than taking the annuity.

1599 2018-10-20 16:05:24 Generally, I have a rather conservative approach regarding e.g. financial products, my way of investing and spending money etc. Thus, conservatism mostly  effected my investing decision, often also resulting  in risk aversion towards stocks/investment decisions. #rpifti
1600 2018-10-20 16:04:48 Stocks because I just love their scent
1601 2018-10-20 16:00:45 Your bias inhibits you. Stocks are just vehicles to make money, and this has been solid for a couple of great rips with another one to come.

1607 2018-10-20 15:57:21 I need to invest in some stocks
1608 2018-10-20 15:57:02 I will be the last one laughing.. look at banking stocks look at automaker stocks look at China stocks look at Emerging Market currencies.. they all have dropped substantially... What you are witnessing is the Calm before the storm
1609 2018-10-20 15:55:17 Finally, I have absolutely no idea where stocks broadly will go next week, or by year's end. I have both longs and shorts now, and likely will continue to do so. 
I'm attempting to manage risk based on my view of overall general conditions, (now) being well hedged and prepared.
1610 2018-10-20 15:55:15 Even if you are still contributing to your 401K...you should open a Roth IRA...this lets you invest in stocks or whatever you want!
1611 2018-10-20 15:55:08 What do you think about the marijuana stocks going on right now? I know you said you were going to buy some. Just your honest opinion. Myself I was looking to buy 10 shares in the next few weeks.

1615 2018-10-20 15:53:08 Check daily ,2-3 months chart
1616 2018-10-20 15:52:54 LOL Hillary rallies. Trump kept his word about change. The tax cut more than doubled the budget deficit in a single year. There's a tsunami of new US debt coming to auction in 2019-20.  Those yields will go up, and interest rates with them. Time to rebalance 401k away from stocks
1617 2018-10-20 15:51:06 Yeah, it's easy to forget how much some of these stocks have run up this year. I mean, $AMZN up 74% at peak, $NFLX 115%... 

It's apparent that they shifted gears this year and the trend steepened. Add some bear divs. on larger time timeframes and you might have a subtle melt-up
1618 2018-10-20 15:49:58 Even at a 4% 10 year yield, somewhere close to normal -- (or at least 1.5% real yield) one can feel a bit safer being more heavily invested in stocks that still are performing well -- because the artificial 'sugar" has been removed. 
At least that's my thinking on it.
1619 2018-10-20 15:49:01 Great point MD - these stocks have come a f- of a long way and PEs still aren't exactly low
- they can get killed a lot more if tape rolls over

1621 2018-10-20 15:48:27 Insider knowledge helps most make millions in stocks on both sides of the aisle
1622 2018-10-20 15:47:06 We need to get back to "fair value" , not stocks, but on bond yields. Historically, "fair value", expressed on a 10 year US government bond, is 2% "real rate". To this, one adds the inflation rate, currently 2.5%.  
So "fair value" is 4.5%. 
THEN, we can see where stocks settle.
1623 2018-10-20 15:46:54 Where do you value sp short term(eom) and long term?
1624 2018-10-20 15:46:25 If I was a MM, I would have taken some of my profits from other markets and been loading up on crypto for the pat few weeks. Then I would pump the price, get it all over the news, stocks break bearish but cryptos break bullish... much fomo, then sell at the top again.
1625 2018-10-20 15:44:32 I am not a permabear, but have been uncomfortable with the valuations on stocks from the QE environment for some time. Analysis of the market is far different than just the  economy and earnings, especially during this period of interest rate distortion, because of valuations.
1626 2018-10-20 15:43:22 My latest bag of $zer has now increased in value by more than 52% in 8 days.. I told you to join this a few days back.. if you did, you gained more than stocks normally does in a full year.. still waiting ??? #jointheride #zerocurrency

(1) Hold more stocks than bonds
Five-Year T-Notes = +5.1%
DFA US Market Index = +10.1%

(2) Hold more large/small value stocks
DFA US Large Value Index = +11.4%
DFA US Small Value Index = +13.5%

1643 2018-10-20 15:34:28 Yes, jobs and stocks are up. But we hv a leader who advocates violence, who lies, who  disrespects women. His rallies praise those who assault others. T-shirts saying “tree, hang, journalist” are being worn. BTW, half of country is more like 1/3.
1644 2018-10-20 15:34:09 Step 1) Pick a list of stocks you’re interested in buying.
Step 2) Throw the list away and invest in bonds instead.

1656 2018-10-20 15:26:57 My thoughts are on current market behavior. No matter how big is the increase on Twitters MAU, it will be smashed after Thursdays report. Market wants cheap stocks so the big investors can replenish their portfolios. And get earnings on this fourth quarter. $TWTR is a great stock
1657 2018-10-20 15:25:37 Unfortunately it's not the best time to be in the NASDAQ unless something changes. NASDAQ stocks are to volatile at the moment due to unfortunate policies of the current governmental administration. I hope Atari can weather it, but there's a chance it won't & that makes me sad.
1658 2018-10-20 15:25:19 Exactly!! I usually don’t short stocks (I’ll go  to cash/short term bonds.) But if the economy/market pulls a 2008, this position 100% pays off, and has a great chance to still pay off even if it doesn’t.

Never search daily for different different stocks
keep 3-4 stocks on screen.. watch them like a "उल्लू" (don't mind plz)..

In the end markets and exchanges are all the same.

1769 2018-10-20 14:00:34 The biggest structural advantage to investing in small illiquid microcaps is "bigger smarter" money can't buy them until their stocks are higher and more liquid.

bcoz it will then become a habit

1816 2018-10-20 13:16:25 Pocahontas, how many investments do you hold in individual stocks and how much did you take for special interests just this year?  Let’s start there, shall we
1817 2018-10-20 13:13:23 It's probably my biggest position now which does make me lean towards trimming soon but I've learnt that Stocks like #ETO can rise a lot more than I'd initially expect. It's still underpinned by Library Value and potential Takeover. 500p will probably get me Slicing.
1818 2018-10-20 13:13:03 Sentiment is neither smart or dumb money. I think you are using a cliche term in an inappropriate manner. I think you are also failing to account for leads & lags and the market discounting mechanism. Look at housing & auto stocks. They're already discounting a lot of negatives.
1819 2018-10-20 13:12:50 Wow there’s a lot of information in this one.

1832 2018-10-20 13:00:36 employment and stocks might be up a little. but people are still drowning in debt, on the verge of bankruptcy have no security and the future is as bleak or worse economically than it was 2 years ago even if current conditions are marginally better.
1833 2018-10-20 13:00:32 So they keep it in investment portfolios (Stocks, bonds, treasury bills etc) just a percentage would be in the Banks and they would run a Coporate account which won’t give banks as much as having those individual (retail) account

1840 2018-10-20 12:57:11 @Thorgood maybe not directly, but lately most stocks are supported by sentiment (growth), not earnings (value), which can change overnight..

1848 2018-10-20 12:52:25 Do they set XRP to $1? Do they set it to 10? $1000? I think that's the only thing that worries me about crypto in general is that the days of it being like Penny stocks are probably done. They days of it settling in on an exact price will come. What that price will be is the ?

1885 2018-10-20 12:16:21 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to improve your EDS
1886 2018-10-20 12:14:28 Invested in 3 different marijuana stocks. Would love to see how well they've done in 10 years.
1887 2018-10-20 12:13:58 Yes exactly. 

White men like Thomas here saying put your money in stocks or take it away or whatever are the reason the economy crashes and kills millions of PoC every year. 

He really should just be laboring for his bare needs in a socialist utopia.
1888 2018-10-20 12:13:26 Shame they did away with public stocks and hanging...
1889 2018-10-20 12:13:05 Don't get too excited about legal weed; government's stocks are gone and they will have to look at the black market to meet the demand.  A lot of adjustments will have to be made before it becomes sustainable, but imho, they are doing it wrong.

2010 2018-10-20 09:33:58 When buying stocks or anything, don't let your brain trick you into thinking in the short term and operating on sentiments.

What is value will always be valuable. It does not matter how much it is - cheap or expensive - If it is value today, it will be value in the future
2011 2018-10-20 09:33:36 Good positions. @coinvest is a much better play than Aura though imo. It will surpass it as no.1 d’app next year once they add shorting, margin, stocks, security tokens and precious metals trading to their decentralised platform. Plus the hardware wallet and debit card. Full eco.
2012 2018-10-20 09:33:21 ... generally agreed @Nouriel . Nevertheless I see other big bubbles these days which carry much more relevance for global markets, e.g. bonds, Italy’s debt or US/China stocks, such as $tsla or FAANG in general
2013 2018-10-20 09:32:45 You will fInd most Green NGOs operate the same gag. Paid chuggers, mist of the funds end up in the stock market, in stocks of companies which make the most dividens, andto whuch they are oposed to.
2014 2018-10-20 09:32:03 Le Brexit a créé des milliers d’emplois en Europe. Le gouvernement U.K. demande officiellement à la population de faire des stocks de nourriture et de médicaments. Si ça ne rappelle pas la guerre, qu’est-ce que c’est ?
2015 2018-10-20 09:31:05 Am no crypto expert, but coming from rates trading, crypto pays you nothing for holding, your only reward is potential appreciation, like a house you don't rent out. Buffet was highly dependent on cashflow "float" streams from insurance sold, and dividends received on stocks held
2016 2018-10-20 09:29:02 Bro, it's always good to see you actively trade.
2017 2018-10-20 09:27:57 New to Market #AMC stocks (eg. HDFC AMC, Reliance Nippon) should be most volatile in the market. Given their business growth is dependent on markets, negative sentiment in market will have exponential effect on their AUMs and earnings. Avoidable at highly volatile markets.

2022 2018-10-20 09:20:38 But for a long time people made money off Ford, Chrysler & General Motors stocks. If you're watching the fundamentals & can see when a sector is going to downturn, you then get out at that time. Why get out (or not get in) when there is money to be made? 5/10 yrs is not a bubble.
2023 2018-10-20 09:19:43 Nouriel, you know it well! Crypto space is highly volatile and the process has fat tails. However, you can not look into this field of investment as you do to Fixed income. There is a well known literature on Lotary Stocks, you should look into it.
2024 2018-10-20 09:17:11 It is not with all 50 stocks in the index na, in any portfolio one will get most returns from 20-30% of stocks only, rest will be laggards,(80-20 Pareto principle) That's why index rebalancing.

2044 2018-10-20 08:55:34 That’s where I’m from and it’s even worse than the media portrays it. I think one of the main problem capitalists have is they see stuff like ‘unemployment down! Stocks high’ and think that = success. London has lots of millionaires but drive to the NE and it’s a different world!
2045 2018-10-20 08:54:48 brother no point selling now if u have baught at 300++.. I have experienced myself in past..several stocks fall more than 50% and just when u sell to book loss, a sharp retracement happens
2046 2018-10-20 08:52:33 Hi Jayda - Many thanks for your message. I very much regret however that this particular wallpaper was discontinued a few seasons ago. I have checked availability with our London stores but unfortunately there are no  remaining stocks. Kind regards, Dawn S
2047 2018-10-20 08:50:23 that sucks, the offer is only available while stocks last, but this depends on the store. can you tell us what the store had said to you? >NT

2060 2018-10-20 08:35:18 Was also in good short opportunities such as the NFLX gap-up short after earnings but didn't hold for a longer move - too quick to take my profits. Given the mkt environment with growth stocks selling off on good earnings results/upgrades I could've left more risk on the table.

2067 2018-10-20 08:25:32 Which markets still look bullish? Weirdly enough crypto markets are getting a bullish bias and some of the cannabis stocks as well, although the bubble has burst.

2068 2018-10-20 08:25:30 Too late for Sherpao. His political stocks have been battered in 2018 election. The cracks had already started in senate election. With no presence in KP assembly, his only chance can be patching up with PPP in one form or another.
2069 2018-10-20 08:24:50 In bourdieusan terms capital refers to stocks of internalized ability and aptitude as well as externalized resources which are scarce and socially valued. Like the more traditional form of capital, they can be transformed and productively reinvested

2121 2018-10-20 07:05:45 RT CNNBusiness: US stocks kick off the day in the green. Dow climbs 100 points, rebounding a bit from Thursday’s 327-point decline. Procter & Gamble leaps 6% on accelerating sales growth. PayPal soars 9% after earnings beat and momentum from its Venmo platform. Watch live …
2122 2018-10-20 07:03:54 Value investing is intellectually easy, but emotionally tough. It is easy to find the unloved, low priced stocks or avoid the over priced ones. The tough part is to look like fool almost 80% of the time by avoiding exactly what is popular !

Trump admin is seeking to ban bump stocks administratively."

2153 2018-10-20 06:34:35 Yes, early 2018; gold & related stocks got crushed since. DD fine if you can put full faith in pubco numbers based on what they claim happened a quarter or more ago. Buying dogs will eventually get you bitten, and all gained before will be gone. Will stick with charts. Good luck!
2154 2018-10-20 06:34:24 I would like to trade in stocks and perhaps open a brockerage account with saxo I however live in Uganda - Africa.

Thank you

2155 2018-10-20 06:32:29 I don't do outlooks or predictions, because I don't know the future buying & selling of other market participants. Because of this I don't know what price will do - it may change direction at any time. So I just focus on what the markets or stocks I am looking at are doing now.

If the company is fundamental strong means the share price won't be down.
If yes why the Rcom fallen from high to single digits
Have seen the stocks came to single digits from 4 digits even though  the company was fundamental strong.

2160 2018-10-20 06:23:07 People are panicking and selling stocks. Putting money into treasury bonds, etc. Expecting everything to collapse but good, solid companies have shown growth. Staying strong.
2161 2018-10-20 06:20:31 Not Nuns-lobbying group that doesn't pay taxes but lobbies for everyone to pay their fair share, take in over a Mil, have near a Mil in stocks, spend no income on actual charity, I won't claim to know paper work but looks like $5K smallest donation, certainly not my idea of Nuns!
2162 2018-10-20 06:19:26 Interest rates are rising, which is bad for stocks. 
But rates are rising because the economy is growing, which is good for stocks. 
High growth could cause inflation, which is bad for stocks. 
But inflation could boost earnings, which is good for stocks. 
Repeat until crazy.

The only permissible way to trade stocks is through spot transactions. (Current value for current price)

You can't buy stocks in forwards and future transactions. Also no shorting.

2224 2018-10-20 05:18:29 ?? What is there to disagree? Fear gauge is a chart. You disagreeing with the chart? After Oct 2008 Lehman moment stocks fell 50% more until March 2009. I am not suggesting this is the point of maximum pessimism. That we will know only in hindsight.

Buy and sell decisions based on the fundamental of the stocks / businesses
2228 2018-10-20 05:12:48 Stocks plunged as Occidental Petroleum Corporation unveiled a wary picture frame today.
2229 2018-10-20 05:12:40 Super race fans Jean Rivich & Johnny B have add an extra $1000.00 to the winner of the QA1 Street Stocks & have added an extra $100.00 for 2nd through 11th in the A Main. Just another reason to #GYATK for the Klash.
2230 2018-10-20 05:11:33 I think pot stocks have officially gone from buy the rumor, to sell the facts. They've had the BTC 20,000 feeling for quite some time now. Beginning of the end imo. 2/2
2231 2018-10-20 05:11:29 Depending on income levels it ranges from suppressing demand by investors (empty, multple homes, Air BnB), to building low income housing. From shelters to PBR. Housing shouldn't be traded like stocks. Its a necessity.
2232 2018-10-20 05:10:55 Imagine what life would be like if reporters actually did their job like @Project_Veritas . It is okay though Jimmy, you'll likely only get the stocks, not the gallows.

2234 2018-10-20 05:09:36 Holding physical, but have been #BTD on miners. Exploration stocks continue to consolidate. Some breaking down, some breaking out. Most are coiling to go higher it seems. 
$GTT is one I'm holding. $RNX was another big mover for me recently. 1/2
2235 2018-10-20 05:08:21 I did the same thing with stocks. I visualised multibaggars. I don’t wanna comment on how it worked for me 
2236 2018-10-20 05:06:22 A little because housing and regional bank stocks are in meltdown mode.  Not bullish for broader markets, no?
2237 2018-10-20 05:05:55 after selling the few stocks at home, i think i'd be selling off white next??

2239 2018-10-20 04:59:12 2/2 ... enjoying big rallies. Suspect a lot of Canadians are flush with  pot stock profits and looking to multiply those gains in "resource"  stocks. Of course if there is a big rally in #gold, for whatever reason, that could fuel the fire considerably.
2240 2018-10-20 04:59:06 The biggest problem with Pharma companies is U.S. FDA Inspections, Observations ,  stocks take months to rise 15 - 20% and give up their whole hard earned  gains on U.S. FDA Inspections and Observations.
2241 2018-10-20 04:56:32 #BTD on gold/silver stocks only, I presume?  Have been seeing a LOT of the exact type of action that typically precedes a major rally in the penny stock "miners", breaking long-term down trends. Several charts posted recently on the blog. Tickers like $SIR.v and $GTT.v ... 1/2

2244 2018-10-20 04:53:50 I knew what you meant. So, if you have no problem with eliminating bump stocks then we at least have some common ground. I honesty don't care if someone is carrying, it's none of my business. What concerns me, as it should you, is semi's getting into the wrong hands.
2245 2018-10-20 04:53:27 I don’t agree with this at all. Most of the mass shootings in this country have been committed by white people. I get how a fee to carry has asymmetrical socioeconomic implications, but hopefully this isn’t an argument against tests, bump stocks, or background checks
2246 2018-10-20 04:50:57 @Twitter yo. why ur stocks so low help pls.
2247 2018-10-20 04:49:59 Next time @cryptomanran talks about BTC like he talks about pot stocks. I am selling all my coins.

2249 2018-10-20 04:49:48 Check out Warren Buffett’s opinion.  I believe there was an recent article that I read, but I can’t remember who published his comments.  Google it.  But I’m thinking he said “stocks”.  Now don’t listen to me Thomas, you should research it.

2251 2018-10-20 04:49:28 There is a set of factors you need to look into before trading stocks in a halal way;
1. Halal business
2. Composition of capital used by the company 
3. Composition of revenue sources
Etc.
And since these factors tend to change overcome, there must be a halal stock index

2254 2018-10-20 04:46:14 When you talk about stocks how about taking stalk of the customer services too ?!!!! Most are bizarre, not accountable, are unhelpful, rude, offer no information or solutions but most importantly are so not secure Vis a Vis their customers

2257 2018-10-20 04:41:32 The shorting of airline stocks the days prior, yet the likes of the CIA and NSA weren't able to catch on that something was going down when wall street traders were? Doesn't make any sense the government wasn't involved. #911truth
2258 2018-10-20 04:40:28 Our government represents itself. A small group of people control the other billions on the earth. The economy, costs, stocks, etc.

2260 2018-10-20 04:38:08 But why not eliminate, at least, one of the sources of mass murders? You refuse to answer my question as to WHY you need bump stocks.

2263 2018-10-20 04:32:12 I'll be tweeting stock news to inform people like me with IRAs & 401Ks.  It may help you make informed decisions.  Wall Street doesn't give the full story.  Example, today a Wall Street guy said stocks are risky & likely to decline but "long-term investors should buy now". CRAZY?
2264 2018-10-20 04:31:08 #IfIWonABillionDollars set up trust funds for my family for generations. Try to work with whomever I can that is willing to bring clean water to the citizens in Flint. Invest in long term stocks as well as a startup. Donate as much as I can to organizations that I trust.
2265 2018-10-20 04:30:21 Luxury stocks drop because only the rich can afford luxuries and the rest all have bills to pay.

2268 2018-10-20 04:26:25 #IfIWonABillionDollars some of it into stuff for fam, friends like houses, cars, gifts, etc. some of it into savings, a lot of it into stocks, and the rest into stuff to help others, whether scholarships, organizations to save the earth, or feeding people
2269 2018-10-20 04:26:12 Guessing that you don't have a 401k or own any stocks.  I don't know about you but I didn't go to college I'm married 2 kids own my own home and make under 60k a year. Thank you trump
2270 2018-10-20 04:26:07 The tariff is on the rich who own the steel industry. Ford own stocks in steel. In order to pay and afford the tax. It's either lay off the employees, raise prices or stop buying supplies, inventory and go out of business.
2271 2018-10-20 04:25:43 This indicates that this whole mkt drop is interest rate related. Unless ppl are done living in homes these stocks will likely lead us out along w/ small caps $IWM.

2275 2018-10-20 04:22:00 Lol.. give up on penny stocks and get into crypto.
2276 2018-10-20 04:21:37 You're living in an alternate universe.  No one is taking your guns! Get over it! The idea is to restrict the ability to kill 100's of people in just two minutes. You don't need bump stocks unless you feel your testosterone is too low. Then go get a BMW convertible instead.
2277 2018-10-20 04:16:47 The worst thing that can happen to you is if you make money in wrong stocks 

bcoz it will then become a habit 

and one day some bad stock will take away all your money.

2278 2018-10-20 04:16:14 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to cure your ADHD

2283 2018-10-20 04:09:32 true story, that’s why regulators in Europe usually suspend short selling on bank stocks that fall like a rock during morning trading. never works, but they do it nonetheless.
2284 2018-10-20 04:08:23 My concern is for the majority of Montanans who live paycheck to paycheck with no healthcare, minimum wage job and the Republicans won’t raise the minimum wage. Tell them how happy you are with your stocks.

2288 2018-10-20 04:06:18 #IfIWonABillionDollars I'd quit my job asap. Book a trip to every Disney Park. Buy a Jaguar SUV. Treat my mom & stepdad to an awesome vacation. Buy a ton of sweaters, shoes, purses and a new iPhone. Buy all the concert tixs. Treat my friends. Put the rest in savings, stocks, etc.
2289 2018-10-20 04:05:20 #IfIWonABillionDollars I'd invest on a business or two, buy stocks, buy my own house, car, save money in the bank and donate the remaining 
2290 2018-10-20 04:04:38 Bruh if I won that billion dollars I would do so many great things. The sex worker and stripper economy would thrive, Joe Budden album sales would spike, and yogurt stocks would rise.
2291 2018-10-20 04:04:16 Investing well is hard and time consuming, with 1000s of cryptos, ICOs, stocks and more. CoTrader solves this problem with fantasy funds contests and onchain smart funds.  #CoTrader #Blockchain

2293 2018-10-20 04:03:14 3 things they said at the rally. Raise the age to own a gun to 21. Eliminate assault rifles. You dont need those to hunt or defend yourself. Ban bump stocks and high magazines. You can still have a rifle or a revolver or a piece. However I agree mental health piece needs work.

2302 2018-10-20 03:57:30 I experienced it in 2008 , by that time all my savings were in equity. First thought was to not invest again ever. I started reading about market randomness, investor behaviour, asset allocation after that and here I am still in stocks in 2018 and calm in current situation.
2303 2018-10-20 03:57:21 My guess is Madon looks for stocks moving with a volume increase and the Breakout pattern is forming on the chart.  Sets up and wiats for the breakout.  @mason_fecht am I warm? ;)

2343 2018-10-20 03:26:18 Well again $XMG is down 65% from its 52 week high as are all #lithium related stocks. The sector was hit harder than most anticipated but smart hands buy when weak hands fold. The #battery revolution and the raw materials they require is just getting started, place your bets!
2344 2018-10-20 03:25:58 Most of the stocks already trades like recession. They all priced in recession. Isn’t it?

2351 2018-10-20 03:18:15 If you have a property (a home), then another one is increasing risk. Most invest in property to make money. Why not diversify in to stocks which reduces your risk over the long term. Most folks don't like stock market volatility because they see it as risk.

2354 2018-10-20 03:11:57 How to identify the leader of next bull phase? 

Two Simple Indicators:

1. Look out for stocks that go sideways or show only token correction in a market-wide mayhem

AND

2. Those that make a new high as soon as correction is done 

Consumption / Proxy_consumption is the trend!

2383 2018-10-20 02:45:40 With market near all time highs, look towards value oriented and dividend paying stocks! Also, be mindful of transaction fees when looking for a broker account!

2389 2018-10-20 02:40:35 Shall we learn only nifty behaviour as i feel stck may go up or down but in long run nifty vill move up.  All nifty stocks are corrected by 20%  now
2390 2018-10-20 02:39:00 Despite the recent shield result WA have been around the mark. Would have won it last year without bowling stocks decimated. Batting now the major issue.
2391 2018-10-20 02:36:47 We want to learn behaviour of stocks and all index and not only 50stocks. Then only v cn say we  learned stock behaviour.  Reliance also broke crucial level of Rs1218.
2392 2018-10-20 02:35:28 It got crazy quick only have srpt and amrn planning to release the rest after earnings and data. Glad I had some shorts before this started cushioned some of the losses. I think we could have been forming a top over the last 10 months. Stocks acting poorly look at nflx roundtrip
2393 2018-10-20 02:35:28 Back now.  Proven quite correct on #bitcon and soon too on stocks.

2394 2018-10-20 02:34:26 Hi again.  Following up.  This time it looks like #gold /metals may indeed rise against the stock punge.  For awhile at least.  Margin calls on stocks may force short covering on gold/metals.  Currently VERY long gold #silver as of a month or two ago.  You?
2395 2018-10-20 02:33:45 We will close the orders for Konbats, for now. All slots are already taken. I asked my supplier if she still have stocks left. We will update once we open orders for it again.

2406 2018-10-20 02:27:05 If your a solo winner you should seek professional advice before you go public.

2411 2018-10-20 02:19:49 Jobs growth is slow but not 0. Inflation over the year has been stable, there are NPAs but aren't there loans that are paid also. Fuel & rupee are affecyed across the board internationally. Stocks behaving like this, panic in market is caused by random polls like yours.
2412 2018-10-20 02:17:13 with Obama the deficit went off the chain and most Americans lived at or below  poverty level. With Trump unemployment is down stocks are up companies are coming back.. GOP all the way

2419 2018-10-20 02:03:24 Stocks have double topped after the longest bull run in American history and if you look at the crypto market cap as a whole we double bottomed. As stocks continue to decline Bitcoin will start decoupling from the stocks as a hedge.

2436 2018-10-20 01:45:05 How management communicates mistakes is very important. No one is mistake-free - as investors 40% of the stocks we buy underperform the market - and I'd be concerned about any company where shareholder communication doesn't include a candid assessment of mistakes. - Bill Nygren
2437 2018-10-20 01:43:18 Finally found a reason to sell one of my stocks. I was tricked by INK market research, so the stock on the chopping block is HRI.
2438 2018-10-20 01:42:42 Stocks are 10% cheaper this year, earnings growing at 20%, but a couple 25 basis point hikes deserve a 20% pullback. Because there's a chance growth stops if banks choose to not make loans down the road, a couple banks missed, some chemical plants missed. People listen to this.
2439 2018-10-20 01:42:06 When #stocks get shocked, some people lose confidence and decide the take their money off the table, the market recovers and some more people take their money off the table. Once the profit taking stops, new trends develop.
2440 2018-10-20 01:39:47 Holding three of those. On the sidelines on $BTE for now. Will eventually get back in. Don't like holding stocks in the O&G sector that don't pay a dividend. It's been three years of nothing but sideways, at least with a divy you get some cash flow. $CJ and $VET paying to wait.

2443 2018-10-20 01:36:53 It's interesting to me that $800 billion is what corporations got from the tax cut that they used to buy back their own stock. They want to take the money we have paid into Social Security to pay for their stocks.
2444 2018-10-20 01:35:32 If only V stocks reflected that rise.
2445 2018-10-20 01:33:27 I want to own stocks but I’m assuming the bank will tell me I should have a not maxed out credit card first
2446 2018-10-20 01:33:04 You should trade stocks full time, then you’d be as good at stocks as I am at crypto

Weapons.

Real Estate.
Silicon Valley.
Oh, and oil. 

Why is the United States making poor foreign policy choices? Follow the money.
2460 2018-10-20 01:21:51 Why do tobacco stocks go up every time a legal action is made against vaping?
2461 2018-10-20 01:21:45 It’s not just Tesla. I have seen a few that were matter of fact. Do yes. But SA...They go down on several stocks. Especially if the stock is moving up. I thought I heard someone say that they accept many different writers work??
2462 2018-10-20 01:19:20 They must like social security,  Medicaid, and  Medicare and not a $2 trillion deficit so huge companies can buy stocks back. Weird.

2464 2018-10-20 01:17:11 Another point IMO (limited) is the ongoing wave of trends.  Lithium,  cobalt,  vanadium,  now bio stocks. If you can read  the next wave you will be crowned the next Oracle of " wherever you're from "

2468 2018-10-20 01:11:05 Another mostly down day on Wall Street, if trade wars are so easy to win why are stocks dropping?
2469 2018-10-20 01:10:41 Jan 2020 puts at the $200 strike. 3% position with 10x payoff potential from where I bought them if (when) TSLA goes to zero. I typically don't short stocks at all.  Going to be a painful round trip for you. This is 3Palm, but with fraud.

2471 2018-10-20 01:08:57 This game is 99% temperament and 1% intellect IMO...The real money is made by buying and holding...How many of the world's richest 5000 are short term traders? They are all long term investors in stocks, businesses, property etc average age in the UK is 91, plenty of time

2474 2018-10-20 01:07:51 Don’t invest all your money into one thing.
Put sells on oil since it going down:
Put buys on companies that have something good coming out so when it does drop the stocks go up and you make money. A good sell could be Facebook because it recently dropped and it’s on a down trend

2477 2018-10-20 01:05:25 The SEC doesnt want the public to know that small cap stocks can move 400% daily
2478 2018-10-20 01:04:58 Are there any other stocks you think have big upside?
2479 2018-10-20 01:04:09 1. That’s a great question. There are a lot of variables to be considered. I think their battery storage for commercial and residential may have more of an affect then Tesla’s EV’s on the stocks overall performance. I think the evolution of 1 system; car, battery, solar roof.
2480 2018-10-20 01:03:32 I think the market still has some weakness to go and I have cash so I'll be watching and waiting. Also it's pretty tough for me to be worried about U stocks when the underlying commodity goes up every week.
2481 2018-10-20 01:02:25 @AskRobinhood this company has blocked my transfer to another brokerage and deactivated my account. I have stocks pending and currently losing money! They have time to tweet and no time to resolve issues. I cannot currently touch my account 20k worth!. I will file a complaint!
2482 2018-10-20 01:02:07 Upset that your mega portfolio of stocks is worth less today?
2483 2018-10-20 01:02:06 Sir, that seems like the biggest impediment for retail investors in India. Vakrangee, Kwality, Manpasand, 8K, IL&FS etc. Stocks, liquid funds - no numbers can be trusted and all reading & analysis seems futile when the scam is discovered.

2487 2018-10-20 00:57:53 This is the entitled telling the rest of us how poor they are, like Mitt Romney "having to sell a few stocks" to get through college, while he's telling us to borrow from our middle class parents for college. Clueless.

2489 2018-10-20 00:55:00 #twitter became a bot farm for the Saudi troll accounts. All this because of their soverign fund stake? Is it possible that for some millions in stocks twitter let millions of accounts create four of five worldwide trends everyday every hour? Disgusting!
2490 2018-10-20 00:53:14 It's now gone beyond family business, it's now a corporation, they're expanding - they have sold shares of stocks

2525 2018-10-20 00:16:38 Tesla is but one of many stocks that will be affected by this newfound headwind (as per my thesis) , and given the dire straights they are in financially , without a material equity raise soon (call it 5-7B) , the company very well could go bankrupt.

2533 2018-10-20 00:13:21 Please normalize/adjust these results by “we have both and I prefer one” vs “for some reason my lab only stocks one, and it’s the default.” I have a feeling the latter dictates the results more than the former.
2534 2018-10-20 00:12:56 Quit out 2 stocks in vs a falcon cause I don't need that negativity in my life
2535 2018-10-20 00:11:21 So a Peter lynch style observation would be , check out (or ask friends) what a mortgage costs now , or vehicle financing , those are typically the 2 largest purchases a household will ever make . You are seeing demand fall off a cliff (see homebuilder stocks)

2631 2018-10-19 23:04:52 Start with an aggressive mutual fund and then delve into individual stocks. Own a condo/house? Also a good investment.
2632 2018-10-19 23:04:27 Though iirc adjustable stocks were also included, but just getting a standard length stock is acceptable for almost everyone, but it does mean that the smaller among us couldn't use them comfortably.

2635 2018-10-19 22:58:08 I wouldn’t invest in any tech stocks rights now TBH. For market and moral reasons.

2638 2018-10-19 22:56:42 in my mind the issue is rates going up. leads to debt being harder to pay off, bonds becoming more interesting, and stocks becoming riskier
2639 2018-10-19 22:56:14 stocks, bonds, REITs, websites, etc. anything that pays you money and/or increases in value over time
2640 2018-10-19 22:55:18 Grow up! Loser Libs crying in their beer. Change the channel, and see how great our Country is thanks to this man, taking NO salary, but raising yours, jobs highest ever, stocks, tax breaks, low regulation, unemployment lowest! Geezus!
2641 2018-10-19 22:53:48 Believe me its a blessing that capitalone is being absorbed by etrade. Fees you pay for trading penny stocks is crazy! I have TDA now ( had capital one before switch) and they are great.

Divest from stocks in Saudi businesses & corporations that do business in Saudi Arabia. 
Conserve energy. The less oil we use, the more SA suffers.

I watched one of your beginner videos and how I should invest in something I am passionate about (video game companies). Which game stock is best atm?
2649 2018-10-19 22:46:35 I also do not like generally investing in US stocks either.  For similar reasons Plus there is too much 401k type money being dumped into the market every month by basically ignorant people. The fund managers push this into usual stocks despite valuations + market seems to pump.
2650 2018-10-19 22:46:17 Stocks showing upward momentum on the weekly charts to keep an eye on:

Worse, fishermen have nothing to complain about, EU has actually protected their rights and most importantly, stocks.

2667 2018-10-19 22:30:38 Red flag laws could help. Let concerned family members contact someone if they’re afraid that a loved one with a gun or guns is dangerous to themselves or others, and enable people in authority to take those weapons away. Ban bump stocks. Close loop hole laws.
2668 2018-10-19 22:29:48 @smellyrat chart was nice, similar stocks were running, and when I saw volume coming in I knew other people were thinking the same thing

2670 2018-10-19 22:28:53 Keeping a watch on NPAs is the way to go in Bank/NBFC stocks? Or that can also be window-dressed? Or the current problem are the vagaries of interest rates?

2717 2018-10-19 21:52:41 Those tax dollars shouldn't be going to subsidies for large corporations that then use tax cuts and said subsidies to buy back stocks and not raise employee pay; they should serve the people! The same people who bailed out said companies after they took risky bets!

What is your favorite “tell” or signal that you find is either always bearish or always bullish.

2728 2018-10-19 21:45:38 You forgot, is George Soros a majority stock holder? He is the one that controls CNN, MSNBC, ABC, NBC, and a few others. He owns over $44M of Time Warner stocks. That is why these stations all repeat the same pointsdaily, against TRUMP. Find out who is GS and it should scare you.

2757 2018-10-19 21:33:38 The market is rolling over as algorithms and traders try to find bottoms. In a few days / weeks, wallstreet crooks will downgrade stocks like $AMD $NVDA at rock bottom prices, at which point american idiots will capitulate and sell. At that point, is a great time to buy.

And oh yeah, tax the top 5%.
2774 2018-10-19 21:18:14 Some folks made a fortune on cannabis stocks this past month. Those that purchased  1,000 $IGC shares at $1.22($1,220) and sold at $14.58 made $14,558 in 2 weeks lol. INSANE. I only bought and sold 15 shares bc I am poor.

2781 2018-10-19 21:12:47 How to identify the leader of next bull phase? 

Two Simple Indicators:

1. Look out for stocks that go sideways or show only token correction in a market-wide mayhem

AND

2. Those that make a new high as soon as correction is done 

Consumption / Proxy_consumption is the trend!

2784 2018-10-19 21:11:11 Stocks fade following strong start to end mixed
2785 2018-10-19 21:09:14 The problem is that most people who are comfortable owning stocks are almost always fully invested.   You guys have, correctly, been telling us to be so for years now.  So, where is the cash supposed to come from?  And those who are sitting on cash will never invest.
2786 2018-10-19 21:09:10 the correlation of two ETF like $SPY and $IWM representing the minority of stocks and the majority of stocks is  "ONE". everything can happen but before it can become better it has to become worst. SELLoffs, a crash or the inferno has to happen

2789 2018-10-19 21:07:19 You mean like the past eight years?   Sounds pretty fantastically fine to me.  Interest rates are rising, and that brings down fair value, but 10% earnings growth is still possible and stocks will rise on these earnings.
2790 2018-10-19 21:07:00 Jorge, the professional's who are licensed by regulation to manage pension funds know less about crypto than you. They're the experts people turn too for investment advise. 2008 just shows this ignorance is pervasive & systematically true. You cant just invest in stocks.

2822 2018-10-19 20:49:37 Quick question, do you buy gold mining stocks such as Barrick, Acacia, AngloGold, or Newmont? Or strictly just buy gold itself?
2823 2018-10-19 20:49:03 US stock market is up mainly due to US sanction on Iran which boosted oil and other stocks(sentiments), and oil over $60 means shale industry becomes active again(and thus more economic activity in other sectors)
Meanwhile trade deficit has grown with china and others.
2824 2018-10-19 20:48:51 Even though I own a sum total of 44 stocks.
2825 2018-10-19 20:48:02 No, it didn't slip as 'interest rate, trade concerns weigh'.

It went 2% high during the week, so big fish dumped their stocks. Price went down, now they will buy again. So it will went high again next week.

Interest rate, trade concerns don't change everyday lol
2826 2018-10-19 20:48:01 Killing endangered species is cowardly, All commercial fishing & recreational hunting for all species should be stopped for a time to allow stocks to replenish.

2828 2018-10-19 20:45:56 Bullshit, Saudi’s killed a lot more on 9/11. All this had CIA deep state approval to try to short military stocks and pull some quick profits.

2831 2018-10-19 20:45:02 OK!!  You don't even have to do that just let me 100,000 and I will be debt free and be able to invest in my stocks
2832 2018-10-19 20:45:01 Stocks are up only because of buy-backs, but how long can that last?  

Eventually, the money being used for buy-backs will dry up and a correction will occur.  

Execs must be expecting that correction if they keep selling their personal stocks and options.
2833 2018-10-19 20:44:59 Instead of EB5 investor VISa, there are many hardworking people on H1B who already earned more than 500k by stocks and salary..HR392 will take US economy to new levels. Currently stock market fell because of weak house sales, HR392 will make housing sales and economy boom
2834 2018-10-19 20:44:49 Dang my company's stock was like the only one to hang on today... sheesh 
Stocks have taken a beating this month 
2835 2018-10-19 20:43:17 My heart is heavy for those suffering incarceration for cannabis related crimes as we rejoice about legalization and speculate on weed stocks. I hope more is done right this historical injustice.
2836 2018-10-19 20:43:02 And every time they screamed it, gun stocks rose bc the nuts went out and bought more guns.
2837 2018-10-19 20:42:52 These are not talking points, their the truth. Talking points are "the economy is doing well thanks to Trump", when that's a boldface lie. Or that stocks are up.
2838 2018-10-19 20:42:11 I'm saying that stocks have already topped (bubble's breaking) and are likely to be down 35% (or more) from here, while gold is has just begun it's next launch with gold shorts (futures) at the same level (too high) and longs (too low) as they were at gold's bottoms.
2839 2018-10-19 20:41:45 @FrescoLeon MY friend who is working in Google told me that he has 8 friends with more than 300k stocks. They want to buy homes here, but the uncertainty of H4EAD, and HR392, they are hesitating to buy, all this money may go to Canada or to India if we do not get HR392 soon.
2840 2018-10-19 20:41:45 Thirty-one years ago today, the stock market fell because the stock prices were artificially inflated, meaning the stocks were not worth their prices. When President Bush became the President, the stock market corrected itself, and prices were more accurate.

2857 2018-10-19 20:28:31 Agreed, can't trust any earnings. Remember stocks can beat & still go down.
2858 2018-10-19 20:28:08 Stocks end mostly lower as early rally fades. Dow +64, +0.3% to 25,444. 

But S&P 500 -0.04%, Nasdaq -0.5%, Russell 2000 -1.2%.

Big-stock winners were largely in defensive sectors -- utilities, consumer staples, drugs.

2867 2018-10-19 20:26:15 So aka pot stocks are way over evaluated. Gotcha!
2868 2018-10-19 20:25:45 World stocks little changed: US -.04%; Europe -.1%. Yesterday's sharp declines ran out of steam as investors evaluated the markets & the numerous financial and geopolitical issues that might affect it. Strong earnings will mitigate some of those issues but not the volatility.

2871 2018-10-19 20:24:08 Bad day for stocks. Today learned about the PDT on Robinhood after I successfully traded the 10 am reversal on $GE so I stayed on that option until next week. I hate entering a position on a Friday.
2872 2018-10-19 20:23:40 Invest it in stocks that pay dividends.

2880 2018-10-19 20:20:25 Go back to school and change my degree to paleontology. Buy a modest home but make the inside a jungle theme like something out of a dinosaur park (animatronics and all ). Give some to my family and hide the rest away in savings, stocks, etc~
2881 2018-10-19 20:20:07 I buy! With stocks I play long term, so I like getting things at a discount. I bought more after the third or forth day of hard declines.

With options, because I’m playing short volitility, I also open new positions, since volatility is very high.
2882 2018-10-19 20:19:44 Jeffrey Star Cosmetics opened in the Philippines already!! Waaah!!!  I hope they have a lot of stocks because I’m def gonna buy when I get home.

2924 2018-10-19 20:03:32 More stocks for me in $FTNW at 9.25. Not much rational in this development but we know the market can be rational for a longer time than expected. @Sqwii a bit negative on the technical part now, given the break of 9.66. However, $75M mcap vs. $350M rev. is too good. GAV 10.5 now
2925 2018-10-19 20:01:52 Hahaha
2926 2018-10-19 20:01:42 A sputtering finish for stocks, with the Dow hanging on but the S&P slipping into the red, with the Nasdaq pressured lower by a selloff in chip stox...ugly day for AMD.

2955 2018-10-19 19:44:57 I just don’t see the fact that regional banks and home builders are melting to new lows into the end of the week as evidence of risk appetite for stocks. We’re betting it’s the opposite
2956 2018-10-19 19:43:49 This is the best time to buy stocks. Trump is messing up the messing up the stock markets. Say what yall want, but I don't look a gift horse in the ass.

2967 2018-10-19 19:37:53 It’s been a tough macro period since very early October. Long bonds, EUR basically same spot for two weeks. Stocks unchanged since 10/10. Basically, the market has been designed to gobble up implied vol.
2968 2018-10-19 19:37:47 Yes so they can use the rate raise to create a crash to inturn buy up all the discounted stocks and then run up to ATH again. Repeat process. Same excuses same bs every time

1) Is the market going to crash?
2) Why are executives are selling stocks in their companies?
3) What effect does the China market crash (down 20%) have on USA?
4) Why are car and new house sales down?
5) Impact of $Tillion/yr USA budget deficit
2971 2018-10-19 19:37:05 If Maria wouldn´t have been at CNBC 20 years ago, I might never have touched US stocks back then,, most of them still sitting in my portfolio, building the core of the nest egg.  Big thanks !

“Be demonstrably less long of equities.”
“This is the start of a bear market.”
“Could take stocks down 15-20% over the course of the next year.”

3002 2018-10-19 19:24:16 Trading some guys is a way of diversifying your portfolio. Not trading any is putting everything into high risk/return stocks. Trading them all is transferring everything into bonds.

3019 2018-10-19 19:13:14 True, stalking stocks for next week.
3020 2018-10-19 19:13:09 It's how about how the numbers are reported. Assume stocks are 33% underfished, 33% fully fished, and 33% overfished. There are two ways of saying this: 1) 66% of the stocks out there are caught sustainably; 2) 66% of the stocks are overfished or fully fished. NGOs always use #2.
3021 2018-10-19 19:12:34 Could be a number of reasons: 1) Many of these stocks have very rich valuations. 2) There is some early evidence that IT cloud spending is slowing down. 3) Possibly general fears about ongoing US-China trade war, slowing global growth.
3022 2018-10-19 19:12:22 $DJI is again the only major index that is up for the day. With $IWM  tanking, big money is unloading stocks while supporting $DJI to cheat small investors that the market is fine.
3023 2018-10-19 19:12:03 for the same inexplicable reason $TEAM is plugging despite very good earnings report after hours on Thursday------ lots of extreme damage to many tech stocks also
3024 2018-10-19 19:11:34 Ultratech cem- hit the prev bottom. Expect a small bounce  & correction f another 20% in short term. Other cement stocks may follow it
3025 2018-10-19 19:11:27 They are projecting EM stocks at 3.2% real.  Last quarter they projected 4.5% real. EM stocks have gotten killed since last quarter.  The math isn’t computing for me

3028 2018-10-19 19:08:13 HUL- Expect another 20% correction in short term. 45-60 days. Selective FMCG stocks may follow it.
3029 2018-10-19 19:07:52 There will be new high momentum stocks be sure. Combustion and oil is dead and there is a replacement for it. Watch it unfold. Hydrogen economy.

3075 2018-10-19 18:50:24 In my opinion stocks are in a bearish pattern. I anticipate from now till the 1st quarter of 2019 to have more of a decline. This is me strictly analyzing history trends and its current pattern. Stocks have had a great run, but it will end before another great run begins again.

3086 2018-10-19 18:44:49 Corporations. "The people" as in the working masses of people do not own stocks.
3087 2018-10-19 18:43:58 I think it’s very difficult/limiting to do portfolio management in a vacuum, taxes & even estate issues are integral. Investors generally need way more guidance/discipline than they assume (they have blindspot bias), especially the more you deviate from market & hold more stocks.
3088 2018-10-19 18:43:36 Yup! Although I bought Some today, I would have liked to add more when it dipped below $32.70 but I have other stocks to manage as well. In due time my friend.

3099 2018-10-19 18:39:29 How about the “experts” claims the markets were “oversold” on the last drop? They said it was time to buy stocks like AMZN, ADBE, NVDA, NFLX, AAPL, GOOG, FB & others! I hope you did NOT take their advice! The longer term charts are weighing the prices down! Only short term bounce
3100 2018-10-19 18:38:27 In each ran some sectors and stocks do out perform and some do not. Now after so much news and rumors for sure Big FII and and HNIs and MFs will not like to have exposure in NBFC for a very long time .Specially in those NBFC who are specific to real estate and housing fiance.

3109 2018-10-19 18:34:14 There seems to be a massive air pocket all week in the Weed stocks this week. Large sell volume swooping these lower quickly

3118 2018-10-19 18:31:19 Strawman. I know the difference between semi and full auto and you are conveniently negating the fact that bump stocks make that difference negligible. Ar15 with a bump has a fire rate in the 600pm range. Remove the bump and it isn't even close. Now who's peddling falsehoods? Bye
3119 2018-10-19 18:31:14 True true. How much do you normally invest in stocks? I do myself play around with them too.

3123 2018-10-19 18:29:39 @PowerLunch Rates & stocks have been rising together for more than 2 years. Now we are asked to believe that yields are now causing stock prices to fall sharply? The
media & most talking heads need to find some outside causality to “explain” why a particular market move occurs.
3124 2018-10-19 18:29:24 AN hour and a half to go before NA market casinos close, so you can light up some weed and forget about their stocks' selloff this week, new week next week.

3126 2018-10-19 18:28:33 The stock has a very low float. It could go either way and very fast. No stress, all stocks go through a cycle. It will run again and run hard. Just gotta wait for the reversal. Patience.
3127 2018-10-19 18:28:29 It's a carnage out there today, my only consolation is that the stocks I'm invested in are not crap companies so they'll be in the green and profitable. Patience is key. Waiting and watching is the hardest part #potstocks

3132 2018-10-19 18:27:31 Huge intraday reversal, particularly for tech stocks. The "BTFD" crowd looks to have gotten suckered-in with Tuesday's big rebound (bull trap) and now they're paying the price. Next couple of hours (as well as next week) could get interesting.

3141 2018-10-19 18:24:23 What a stupid question. Why invest in a money losing company like the media. #JournalismIsDead. You invest in stocks or index mutuals.
3142 2018-10-19 18:24:15 68% of voters said that 2018-19 U.S. soybean ending stocks will NOT break 1 billion bushels. We think 68% need to change marketing advisors!
3143 2018-10-19 18:24:03 The more I study about bitcoin, crypto, stocks, and the Bible the more I realize how much of a hypocrisy we’re living in these days. We are living in the greatest times because the internet is exposing the truth #staywoke #bitcoin #truth
3144 2018-10-19 18:24:01 If they do next spring it would cause a mini bubble in real estate. Actually planning to sell a home if that happens. Home builder stocks would rip higher as result.
3145 2018-10-19 18:23:53 68% of voters said that 2018-19 U.S. soybean ending stocks will NOT break 1

3147 2018-10-19 18:23:37 Property IS a financial interest. Stocks might be a financial interest. If a Saudi Arabian citizen pays to stay at your hotel, that is NOT a “financial interest”. It is not an investment that will gain in value.

3151 2018-10-19 18:19:43 On Jan 4, 2018, we moved US stocks to an OW against International & have maintained that all year. On Feb 6, 2018, we moved stocks to a 10% above normal allocation weight. On Sept 4, 2018, we downgraded stocks to a 5% OW & said be less greedy & move into more defensive positions
3152 2018-10-19 18:17:55 Not a bad idea, definitely would invest in marijuana stocks, would start my own farm, and hire people to just run it for my personal

3155 2018-10-19 18:17:16 Until us value guys step in and say enough is enough.  Some of these companies are now trading sub 10PE, cleaned up balance sheets, with much less leverage than 04-06.  

Wouldn't be surprised to see Warren Buffet step up to buy homebuilding stocks soon.

3190 2018-10-19 18:01:39 I believe we're going to get a stock market crash in that timeframe and when stocks fall ~30%, the #Fed will reverse policy. This will signal the peak and fall of the dollar, including USD/CNY. #Gold soars from that point forward. All just mho.

3199 2018-10-19 17:59:06 Best performing sectors today: Utilities and Staples. Tells you a thing or two about Mr. Market's macro view. How is it nobody talks about the impact a near-40% collapse in the homebuilding stocks from their January highs will have on other credit-sensitive/cyclical sectors?
3200 2018-10-19 17:58:55 Semiconductor sector broke down few months ago and has not recovered. In March of this year, Semis stopped going up. Semis are down -15% since. Worldwide growth continues to slow. Chip stocks are very cyclical, the chart points to a bearish trend and good short candidate

As discussed before - will wait for ABC to complete.
3203 2018-10-19 17:57:17 A cautionary tale of investing in individual stocks. Sears has been around approximately 125 years. Its recorded high in the market was 2007. It is now considered a penny stock (price is under $1). 
Don't assume length of operations or history indicate future successes. DIVERSIFY
3204 2018-10-19 17:55:38 I remember when after MSD shooting he said he would ban bump stocks, raise the age to buy long guns and implement common sense gun control. That listed one day before the NRA got to him.

3211 2018-10-19 17:49:23 China's economy has not been decimated. It is still growing at 6.5% per quarter. It just slowed from 6.7%. Their economy is still the largest in the world (using PPP). Their stock market has dropped but most Chinese invest in real estate, not stocks thus it had limited impact.
3212 2018-10-19 17:48:59 Stocks notice.  Spoos sold off 5 points simultaneously with that ed print.

3216 2018-10-19 17:48:27 I would hardly refer to these as investments but trading instruments & although VERY risky but 10% pm is achievable, may sound like pie in the sky but these type of returns are not unheard in forex or even stocks & again the risk is VERY high!
3217 2018-10-19 17:48:16 I went in on the most risky but potentially very rewarding stock. #btai. The stock is structured for high growth. The product is innovative. The company backing it is established. Bio stocks have been underperforming that may change in the future. Its whether it will take off.
3218 2018-10-19 17:47:44 $SPY I'm not anxious to go long on stocks. Days like this you could easily end up taking a lot of little hits that can add up if not careful

3228 2018-10-19 17:44:00 @RobinhoodApp The last beta version is bugged and the charts are default at 3 months also the mini chart previews of your owned stocks. Very bad bug for the users. No answer about that from support I had to leave the beta test program to install a working version :(
3229 2018-10-19 17:43:50 Hey @jimcramer don’t treat them like stocks! You don’t own them you are their papa ;)

3231 2018-10-19 17:43:35 As the years go by, some companies lose their luster & others rise to the top of the markets ... So is it wise to remain invested in the same stock for perpetuity, or sell & move to other stocks !?!
3232 2018-10-19 17:42:59 I wanna go live so bad already in stocks but I know I still got a lot more to learn

3239 2018-10-19 17:39:55 If I win that $1billion lotto the first things I do:

5). Start a charity.
6). Share with family.
7). Buy a new wardrobe that includes more cute tutus.

3242 2018-10-19 17:37:54 $EVSV may possibly be one of those  stocks that have a magical run. The CEO has taken steps to build the business and shareholder value. The  partnership he has formed will no doubt increase revenues. Alerts will be going out on this one creating a big increase in volume.
3243 2018-10-19 17:37:42 #FridayFeeling#stocks  As you can see the market is nervous with no clear conviction, and the sharpies running hedge funds are ready tp pull the rug out from under you in a nanosecond. Enjoy yourself if you can .While their bus and the bus of central banks, the IMF run over you.
3244 2018-10-19 17:37:18 Never buy Chinese stocks.

3247 2018-10-19 17:36:18 #DXY has soared in the past couple of days and yet #Gold just going sideways. Why? Because DXY doesn’t matter to Gold anymore. Neither do stocks (at least not yet). Plain and simple.
3248 2018-10-19 17:36:10 While the conditions are difficult right now there are several stocks setting up for earnings in the next few weeks :)

3264 2018-10-19 17:26:16 agree completely...worst charts on the web... but the portfolio page for trading stocks is all I need. most of my trades are less then a buck.

3269 2018-10-19 17:23:36 I remember when they used to actually trade stocks at the NY Stock Exchange.

Now it's just a TV set

3270 2018-10-19 17:23:33 When will there be stocks for sell?
3271 2018-10-19 17:23:04 Sounds familiar. What about those bump stocks?
3272 2018-10-19 17:23:03 Seattle (WA) Times-Business: US stocks turn mixed at midday after an early gain fades
3273 2018-10-19 17:22:40 Yeah, so when #Bitcoin got hot #CNBC put in a Crypto Show. Now that #Cannabis stocks are, will they do the same thing?
3274 2018-10-19 17:22:29 stocks will make news lows again today
3275 2018-10-19 17:21:41 401K -- a retirement program, usually employees pay into and employers match funds.  Usually 401Ks are stocks that you can choose from.  So you pay your own pension and manage the investments yourself instead of an employer pension plan, which might cost them more money.
3276 2018-10-19 17:21:12 John Templeton once said, "History

3289 2018-10-19 17:17:51 Finally seeing strong stocks starting to make lower lows this week too.
3290 2018-10-19 17:17:44 Mais !!Tu en connais beaucoup des mecs stocks toi ?
3291 2018-10-19 17:17:42 once your stocks+cash is above 25k that doesnt apply to the account, its a SEC regulation, margin is different though
3292 2018-10-19 17:17:02 Both of these companies are shady to say the least. Good luck to them who are hoping against the hope. Sincerely pray every retail investors to get out of these stocks at any price & don't even think of buying them  however mouth - watering they might appear.
3293 2018-10-19 17:16:54 Timing the market is impossible. Some people luck out and do it. But the bigger key is to maintain a balanced portfolio and rebalance. So, when stocks go down, they make up a smaller percentage, and you sell bonds in order to get your ratio's back in line.
3294 2018-10-19 17:16:44 I did a 10-day social media fast & felt good bc I wasn’t comparing or judging.Then I found out my friend who didn’t go to college makes $70k in stocks alone & here I am at a 9-5 job w/ heaps of student debt. Moral: social media doesn’t affect my happiness bc reality already does
3295 2018-10-19 17:16:29 You are right, no PDT in Canada. You can day trade us stocks in Canada without worrying about the PDT rule.

3299 2018-10-19 17:13:04 if u r holding a diversified portfolio no harm , if otherwise its very risky to be in such kind of stocks
3300 2018-10-19 17:13:03 With this kind of market action I view $VIX at 20 as constructive for the markets in general and for TECH especially. With the way TECH stocks are moving today $VIX should be much higher!
3301 2018-10-19 17:12:56 #FastMoneyEspresso
FINAL CALLS:
Jim Lebenthal —> buy $AGN
Josh Brown  —> buy $VZ
Steve Weiss —> buy $CCI
Kate Moore —> buy $MCHI, if Trump & Xi talk at the G-20 meeting, it could relieve a lot of pressure on Chinese tech stocks

3315 2018-10-19 17:09:43 Maybe I should delete all enstar stocks and create the new one later *sweats
3316 2018-10-19 17:09:21 Yes. My tone remains same at all times. When stocks hit highs, it's called confidence. and when same stock hits a low, it's called over confidence. 

Thin line  best wishes to you.

And that's the point
3322 2018-10-19 17:05:50 What I know about #stocks could fit in a thimble, but I've wondered for awhile if someone is manipulating the markets- would that explain the crazy gains/losses?
3323 2018-10-19 17:05:30 I would actually say the other way, factors then sector. That being said, what matters most is probably how a manager views the portfolio and then selects stocks based on that.

3327 2018-10-19 17:04:42 1/2 There are really only two types of bearish calls on #WallStreet: structural and cyclical. When volatility picks up, it is all too easy to conflate the two. That’s one key problem for US #stocks just now, even though earnings are fine and rates are still reasonably low.

3330 2018-10-19 17:03:27 I wonder how McConnell's & other Republicans' investments & stocks look after they pushed this huge tax break for themselves & their donors. Unfortunately for us, greed is an addiction: It will leave them wanting more and more until they bleed us dry and dead.

3476 2018-10-19 16:19:01 Wall Street is pushing 401K & IRA accounts to buy stocks.  Yet CEO's are selling their company's stocks, "smart money" is selling stocks or buying "puts" (stock insurance), & foreigners are selling too.  They hate trump & republicans.  So why is Wall Street pushing stocks on you?

3495 2018-10-19 16:13:10 In the last 13 years of my market experience most analysts advise to buy stock where one loses capital and they advise to buy at expensive valuations. Good stocks are never advised in media,  though few do advise rarely!!

3516 2018-10-19 16:07:05 Prices in shops are justifiable. Remember more than 80% of stocks in shops are imports, even Mthuli confirmed on Ztv yesterday. USA today was @ 1: 3,70 while R100: $17. How do u think they wl get forex to import another stock? Address raw material producibg sectors, not boycott
3517 2018-10-19 16:06:55 Am mad at people disrespecting our staffs because most of them come from low income family. Trying to earn money. Helping their family. If you don’t understand what they are dealing, why the stocks isn’t ready, just politely ask. Or READ. I already put an announcement on fb & ig
3518 2018-10-19 16:06:38 When I clicked on your tweet the date changed to October 19, 2018. Why?
3519 2018-10-19 16:04:50 I don't like the mood on @HalftimeReport . They're talking individual stocks in "bear markets". 
3520 2018-10-19 16:04:31 @HalftimeReport for the Weiss put, China GDP 6.5%, lot of stocks are so cheap on an EPS basis
3521 2018-10-19 16:04:19 Difficult tape right now because major trends have been broken and tape trying to find new range so you have higher randomness than usual.   Once it settles down into a new zone  then individual stocks can start setting up -- earnings will help too.
3522 2018-10-19 16:02:40 I short overextended stocks when they crack vwap on volume and retest vwap. I risk just past vwap and let it fade when it works. Ssshhh, don’t tell anybody. Did I mention vwap?
3523 2018-10-19 16:01:59 China growth slows, misses estimates. That could make Indian market safer, especially since weaker rupee makes Indian stocks attractive
3524 2018-10-19 16:01:51 Like do you pick random stocks out of the stock market & then ask people to "total collapse/plunge/meltdown" of the entire stock market? That's a very child like view.

3563 2018-10-19 15:44:21 There's a *massive* difference between a stock and bitcoin coin that you're definition of bear market doesn't take into account.

For BTC to stay flat income > outgo
3564 2018-10-19 15:43:44 I get it but your message to mom & pops investors is terrible. They sell all their stocks & never get back in.

3603 2018-10-19 15:27:37 I’m excited during this healthy market correction... I don’t like it when stocks run non stop without measurable pullbacks... it’s unsustainable ... This brings opportunity to scoop undervalued champions as well as snag growth stocks a little cheaper

3632 2018-10-19 15:16:01 Did China just report 6.5% GDP growth after losing $3.5T of stock market value in the last year or 26% of GDP?

Important comparison:

In 2008, by the time US stocks had lost a similar proportion the economy was already in deep recession. How's it really any different in China?
3633 2018-10-19 15:15:56 The trading day is underway in the U.S. and stocks have rebounded after Thursday’s sell-off.  The latest round of earnings helped boost investor confidence, as did a report that the U.S. and China’s leaders will meet at the G-20 summit in November.

3654 2018-10-19 15:07:57 This clause is designed to avoid states setting catch limits unilaterally, which usually leads to overfishing and damage to stocks.  

Michael Gove’s recent announcement that the UK will leave the London Fisheries Convention, signed in 1964, under which mutual fishing rights
3655 2018-10-19 15:07:33 the Law of the Sea, signed in 1982. 

This international agreement says that a coastal state has the right to control fishing within its 200-mile zone, but must also ‘seek to agree upon the measures necessary to coordinate and ensure the development of shared stocks’.

With a GOOD long term portfolio, the biggest struggle is to get stocks cheap. 

Sometimes even decent market corrections, like the current one, don't bring down the prices to real attractive levels!

3729 2018-10-19 14:35:12 Skechers $SKX up nearly 20% today. Great quarter. I'm up about 29% on the position I started 3 months ago when the market overreacted on their last quarter. I made 67% #investing in SKX last year, and put it all back in this time. Humm? Should hold or go for quick profit? #Stocks

3736 2018-10-19 14:33:11 I was working at a Wall Street law firm doing securities compliance. But was on the road to Provincetown for a long weekend when the news broke over the radio.  When I returned on Monday lots of head shaking - many financial stocks below book value.
3737 2018-10-19 14:32:45 Sept. existing home sales plunged the most in 2 years, extending the streak of consecutive monthly declines to 6.  Homebuilding stocks are hitting 52-week lows, registering their worst year since 2008.  If housing is this bad during the boom, imagine what happens after the bust!
3738 2018-10-19 14:32:28 With FOMO/Manias, people prefer to chase when a stock is up 100% . . . we saw it with $YECO, $NCTY, $CLWT, $CADC, and $PLAG . . . which is next? My best guess is $LYL

3827 2018-10-19 14:09:41 100% agree with that. Very little downside risk to Uranium stocks. As Mike Alkin says low downside huge upside potential...this is what investors dream about. The lack of any significant recent movement to the downside support that argument well.
3828 2018-10-19 14:09:34 Yeah their stocks are gone because the companies went under.

3898 2018-10-19 13:47:14 Investors are concerned that the slide in Chinese stocks may pull the global economy with it. Since the Trump trade "war" kicked-off Jan. 26th, the Shanghai has dropped 30%. Our own work suggests the probability of a global recession has increased markedly.

3910 2018-10-19 13:44:01 Great question. Worth noting: a) int'l indices are heavy on financials and other typically low-multiple sectors; b) the beta of those stocks invariably exceeds 1.0 in a U.S. downturn. They'll likely give little downside defense, but much larger upside *after* an SPX downturn.

3913 2018-10-19 13:43:31 That future scenario does nothing to justify the valuation of pot companies. Just like the potential reward of a big lottery doesn't justify the terrible odds offered.

4107 2018-10-19 12:31:19 A test of the 2011/2016 lows feels more likely to me. Those lows were caused by major market events - European debt crisis in 2011 and greek/end of QE/rising bond yields in 2015. Now real it's IR hikes and bond yields spiking again, plus growth stocks on higher PEs than dot com.
4108 2018-10-19 12:31:19 @TradeWithNinja do you ever dabble in the bank stocks? $BAC in particular seems pretty bound to fibs in my limited knowledge and use recently.

4114 2018-10-19 12:27:01 I dont really know much about fisheries though I do know that fishing stocks are getting replenished finally. None of the fishing areas in Scotland-indeed no part of Scotland Voted Leave. Even if you can fish as much as you like you still need a market to sell it in.
4115 2018-10-19 12:26:13 Elon makes me too nervous to go near the Tesla stock. Are you looking to buy more than Tesla stocks? Car in the future? Jaguar i-Pace was just released in Norway, so thats probably why its high on the charts. (We both know someone who just got himself one).

4117 2018-10-19 12:24:11 There is am awful lot of Bollox being talked on @BBCWorldatOne about fisheries policy, 1st the Common Fisheries policy saved fish stocks in EU water from extinction, 2nd it was the interpretation by the Thatcher government of said policy which ran down the UK fishing industry!

4122 2018-10-19 12:21:42 If the company is buying stock back then investors who own those stocks are reaping the rewards of their investments. More money into the economy instead of in DC swamp hands. Now follow the tax cuts with expense cuts. Starting with money we give to Mexico.

4131 2018-10-19 12:16:46 Investing in falling market is not easy. Even if we buy low, stocks keep doing down for a while before they eventually bounce back for good.

Remember your panic just a few days ago. My analysis said the DJIA will end higher by year end. The reason? Who wants to sell rising stocks? They risen for the year so no tax loss. Why sell. Dr_Stocks

4334 2018-10-19 10:11:05 Here at NoCoin are only interested in rushing to the next big thing without creating interesting or thorough ideas. Crypto dead? Let's rush to cannabis stocks and derivative products. Now that apps, social medias, and punk band are dead. #investing #Startup

4343 2018-10-19 10:05:07 #US stocks were down, partly on concerns about #China's growth prospects. Beijing will release G.D.P. figures today. Here’s a snapshot of global markets.

4345 2018-10-19 10:02:16 #aaog Lot of disappointments on AIM recently. Sometimes least likely  stocks can turn into best winners. Seem to be gathering momentum, and I eagerly await first zone update
4346 2018-10-19 10:02:15 Finally am seeing my fav stocks with better valuations and high MOS.

Had Seen similar kind of pessimism during 2012-13 in gold loan companies and CV manufacturers and now in NBFCs and HFCs.

Do your own due diligence!!
4347 2018-10-19 10:01:42 Negativity in #Bitcoin market is Absurdly high. Do some math. Fidelity has $7 Trillion in assets. 1%=70 Billion. US Stocks $28 Trillion, 1% = $280 Billion, more than 2X bitcoin. This is huge money. #bitcoin, gonna go up beyond your imagination.
4348 2018-10-19 10:01:34 The Nigerian stock exchange index went down by 7.5% from Q4 2017 till Q3 2018, with most sectors experiencing negative returns. Although a portfolio which was well diversified across industries with carefully selected stocks could have made a positive return within this period.
4349 2018-10-19 10:01:25 My stocks finally went up! I’m so bad at being patient though 
4350 2018-10-19 10:01:03 Judicial Conference for US Courts Committee for Financial Disclosure wouldn't release 2017 disclosure statement of Judge, who appears to filed false statement on his Hollywood and lenders stocks. S-BRIEF tied to issue, with Kavanaugh's recusal motion. FBI notified.
4351 2018-10-19 10:00:54 Interest rates are rising, which is bad for stocks. 
But rates are rising because the economy is growing, which is good for stocks. 
High growth could cause inflation, which is bad for stocks. 
But inflation could boost earnings, which is good for stocks. 
Repeat until crazy.
4352 2018-10-19 10:00:16 So I've about 7 orders open for biotech stocks that idk nothing about. I just read some shills from a dude on twitter about them so I think my strategy will be profitable

4354 2018-10-19 09:58:49 @jimcramer the Chinese president should call @POTUS if they want any chance for their stock market to climb... today looks good for them but wow.. have their stocks gone downTown
4355 2018-10-19 09:58:05 @jimcramer 
Hey, jim. Been a big fan of you. Never communicate with you before.
 If you want to be a long term investor in Apple, what price  rangr is good price to buy stocks and hold it for 2 to 5 yrs. Like $215 yesterday.
4356 2018-10-19 09:57:31 Judge denied having Pecuniary interest in Hollywood and lenders stocks in second case involving David Whitehead, filed against another defendant, not Netflix.
4357 2018-10-19 09:57:23 That's stock shares (contracts) they're not real shares but an agreement of a contract that represents the shares called ETF so no,jst because you hold a portfolio that has standard bank stocks doesn't mean you the owner of Standard bank,the owners r those who takes decisions
4358 2018-10-19 09:55:50 Big buying - 100K Bitcoin is a joke in terms of market size compared to Stocks. $640 million is nothing. Crypto Newbies have Zero understanding of this.. Rounding errors for institutional investors. They will have a very hard time getting positions at these prices.
4359 2018-10-19 09:55:44 Supplemental brief returned by Supreme Court with no notation. However, I know, or we know now, that Supplemental brief was not included or added with the case for Certiorari review. Issue: Judge had Hollywood and lenders financial stocks, but judge denied those stocks in case 2.
4360 2018-10-19 09:53:18 Sir I'm 18 is it right time to take some stocks to hold on ? Or I'm very young for this ?
4361 2018-10-19 09:53:12 Jup, they have a USD account for US stocks.
4362 2018-10-19 09:51:05 Valid point. I think with Institutions like Fidelity and the rest getting involved we could be seeing the end of stocks. We all know they are overvalued due to the QE money. Time will tell if crypto decouples.
4363 2018-10-19 09:49:35 I do that from time to time when I come across any opportunity. Wrote about Sugar Stocks recently. Prior to that ACE, Radico Khaitan, Petronet LNG, Vinati Organics etc.... I am not into any advisory, so I don't post unless I have skin in the game.

4392 2018-10-19 09:21:54 Indian markets never move on valuation. Look at the stocks, most valued once. They move only when they are impacted. Index moves on anything. 2013,2014,2015 daily FII's/DII's investment were in 30,000 crores Intraday. Today it's only 1500 crores. This shows liquidity has gone.

4394 2018-10-19 09:20:49 No idea macro level, at individual stocks levels also no real idea,  other than there are a lot of people very nervously hanging onto "expensive" stocks, who probably will be apt to panic if there are dips.  Watching from the sidelines with a few short orders on
4395 2018-10-19 09:20:48 Oh, for sure. But again, VHS is a single use case. Value communication happens on so many levels, from discount vouchers, stamps, stocks, derivatives, savings, bartering, etc. Denomination in a certain currency is not equal to one use case.

4397 2018-10-19 09:15:23 Since when is a volatile price proof that something isn't of value? Is this some new economic theory of yours that volatile assets are worthless?

4426 2018-10-19 08:41:02 Are bonds, and equities risk-free?

To say that bonds and stocks are ‘less risky’ than cryptocurrency investments isn't necessarily accurate. Government debts are increasing all over the world. There is also a growing corporate bubble after the 2008 financial crisis.

4578 2018-10-19 06:45:05 EU cannot be much tough with Italy. Many other Euro countries are not also better. Majority of them have Ponzi type of pension schemes and huge housing bubbles thanks to huge QE of ECB. I believe with the next recession ECB is going to start buying not only bonds but also stocks.

4584 2018-10-19 06:38:59 Lithium stocks battered lately (although Galaxy recovered by 6.4% today): it's a coordinated assault.
The still-powerful fossil fuels sector is terrified of electric vehicles & home storage, and will fight hard to undermine Li producers by manipulating stock prices where they can

4608 2018-10-19 06:11:58 Ques. How to trade in such market ?
Ans. 
1. Note down relatively strong non-index stocks.
2. Analyse their trend
3. Put them on your watch list.
4. Trade according to your system (Buy when Buy, Exit when Exit, Sell when Sell).
**Plan your trade and trade your plan (nothing else)
4609 2018-10-19 06:11:13 Yeah. It is going to be a shit show. China had some verbal intervention tonight but stocks are  August 2015 heavy.

4680 2018-10-19 05:18:20 probably good idea when moving ALL of it out of stocks that your advisor tried to dissuade you means they worry if your being spooked will cost you money.

4708 2018-10-19 04:53:01 I don't privately hold the USD/Stocks/Bonds in my 401k, so how would not privately holding BTC in my 401k be any different. It's about allowing more choices in these things. I can't invest my 401k money into BTC, so I would welcome that chance.

4710 2018-10-19 04:51:23 Yes I'm buying stocks coz I can afford stocks but I am not buying a house simply because I can't afford it. 
Stocks are risky if you are having a short term view. Fir long term period it's the best asset

4722 2018-10-19 04:36:24 Though I have not invested in any of the above stock. 

However, people like me who want to make an investment in the stock market should avoid these kinds of stocks. 

Need to see this twitte every time before buying any stocks
4723 2018-10-19 04:35:49 Yeah, yeah. We heard. Same old cliche again. It's what you say when you don't have anything at all to stand for. Only to resist policy which has created record low unemployment, high levels of growth, record high stocks, border security, America first, better trade deals, etc,etc

4728 2018-10-19 04:31:59 People ask the Weird Millionaire how he got capital for investing in stocks and real estate. Simple. Living on only half his income. Think it's not possible? Not overnight but over several years, he started with just a 1% cut in spending.

4731 2018-10-19 04:31:38 The NSE stocks have essentially lost on average 15pc of its value and what will further compound this issue is ;

4735 2018-10-19 04:28:40 Global stocks tumble on souring sentiment; oil falls: Stocks fell sharply on Thursday while the Japanese yen rose in a move toward safety assets, with traders citing the Sino-U.S. trade war, Italy's budget concerns and a widening gap between the United States and Saudi Arabia.
4736 2018-10-19 04:27:31 Asian stocks slipped further on Friday as #China posted its weakest economic growth since the global financial crisis, adding to market concerns about trade disputes, rising U.S. interest rates and #Italy's free-spending budget.
4737 2018-10-19 04:27:18 A sharp decline in Chinese stocks set the tone for the tech-driven drop.
4738 2018-10-19 04:25:30 also as markets keep going down as has been happening with Chinese index, most stocks also keep getting down, raising a further requirement of shares to be pledged for matching margin requirements. This can now reverse only when index starts going up because of good numbers
4739 2018-10-19 04:24:02 I know they have a difference,but, Tell me is this not true that the stocks price is dependent only on speculation of people about the future performance of a company, so if Bitcoin is also driven by speculation, why you have a problem.

A publicly traded business is a privately owned business which is owned by a lot of people through stocks.

4757 2018-10-19 04:10:28 How do most people become wealthy (as in lots of money)? 

They either started a very successful business and/or own businesses through ownership of stocks. 

What's the lesson? If you want to increase your odds of being rich, then you need to invest money and not just save it.
4758 2018-10-19 04:08:04 I rather just own the underlying asset in my opinion. You can compare it to gold mining companies but in a situation like this I would rather limit my Crypto exposure to the actual currencies and have stocks with less correlation.
4759 2018-10-19 04:07:22 Simple as this... you’ve believed a lie pushed on your own mind by Media outlets! The uptick in stocks, the 4.2% GDP, the lowest unemployment in 50 yrs. Jobs way up! Economy is steady! Land of the free but you choose to blindly follow hate & miss out on the great American times!

The exchanges then display the OI data for previous day with the updated volume data
4822 2018-10-19 03:12:14 Exactly.  Corporate tax cuts went to stock buy back stocks to fool the country to thinking stock market  is going good when in fact the bubble is about to burst.
4823 2018-10-19 03:12:13 $AMMA Huge move today. I expect a continuation. . . and also, $AMDA should go. Keep a close watch if you're not in. Another penny I'll be watching is $CYTX

4824 2018-10-19 03:11:57 so was tech stocks, Google and AMZN back in the day. One of his biggest regrets was not investing in them . You dont want Buffet insight when it comes to emerging tech/market
4825 2018-10-19 03:11:15 At the same time the majority of the public are scared to trade stocks still so how much does public perception really matter? The mill keeps moving regardless.

4831 2018-10-19 03:05:23 You can thank Obama for the low unemployment. And when stocks are inflated, and companies are using taxpayer $ for buybacks, that doesn't benefit employees or companies in the long run, it only benefits shareholders short term.
4832 2018-10-19 03:05:03 Majority of power stocks are high debt companies

4835 2018-10-19 03:03:16 You (an amateur): Geez your stocks are down heaps today, how much have you lost?
Me (corporate speak aficionado): I haven't lost anything. What you'll find is i'm investing in future gains. Probably.

4837 2018-10-19 03:01:35 It’ll cost the exact same amount that the trump tax cuts cost. Did you ask that you question then too? Imagine the ppl that actually needs help going out in buying items  and pumping money back into the company instead of buying stocks

4849 2018-10-19 02:53:45 Republicans hate it because it would mean the health stocks they own wouldn't make as much a& GOP would lose a wedge issue they have successfully used for years - the cost of universal HC.

4851 2018-10-19 02:52:32 LOL, propaganda. No mention of the jobs being lost. There will always be some gains and losses from both sides of the equation - there continues being a net loss. 26% actual unemployment, negative 7% real GDP growth, stocks 4-10X overpriced, record wealth divide & homelessness.

4856 2018-10-19 02:47:47 "Punishment in prison"? I thought prison WAS a punishment. In the UK before 1842, prison kept people until they got punished - execution, flogging, the stocks, the pillory, the ducking stool, joining the military or transportation to the colonies. I guess the USA needs to keep up

4879 2018-10-19 02:37:52 It depends what the reasoning is for the crash. If stocks dump just because they are overvalued, BTC should remain uncorrelated. But if theres a recession and stocks dump, BTC will go down with it. People need to pay the bills!

4889 2018-10-19 02:32:39 It sounds like advice to professional investors who are in a position to short the market with borrowed stocks.

Amateur investors don’t have this opportunity.

Usually this is done with a futures put, on a timeline of only a few months.

=> we’re very close to a market ‘peak’.

4893 2018-10-19 02:30:20 China GDP data comes in more or less right in line at 6.5%. No other country has this track record at ‘meeting expectations’. Meanwhile Chinese stocks continue slumping down ~25% ytd. Someone’s not impressed!
4894 2018-10-19 02:28:13 Do you also try to take sales away from other stocks you are short? Meanwhile the Model 3 was the best selling American car in the US in September. This is before they start offering lease or selling outside NA.
4895 2018-10-19 02:27:35 It’s like theoretical, most of it is in stocks in his own company.  Bad things happen when you sell off billions in shares of your own company. These people think this guy has stacks of cash sitting at home...
4896 2018-10-19 02:27:08 No and the government report that came out the week talks about the tax cuts have down nothing, because CEOs haven't reinvested in their companies, only have bought back stocks

4899 2018-10-19 02:26:42 So many stocks in motion. Take your pick, small cap, mid cap, large cap. I like them all as long as they're liquid. The ability to stay focused on your trade plan, and tickers can be tough when there's so much action.
4900 2018-10-19 02:26:19 They were in on Panarin, but they should have been in on Hamilton. Thats the problem, Holmgren threw picks away, Hextall stocks them too much.

4918 2018-10-19 02:10:20 Yes sir you are right our market rally on only hope since 2014 , results from companies are normal, Govt is fail to deliver good performance, Now election is near , so most of stocks are back to before 2014 Rate.
People are paying more tax .
4919 2018-10-19 02:08:03 That is true, too. Maybe an offsetting factor for the marginal retail buyer of stocks who might be a late entry bagholder? I guess it would be helpful (but difficult to calculate except via survey)  to know the total buying power of that segment vs the holder of stocks throughout
4920 2018-10-19 02:07:20 yep the banks, resources, tech stocks, growth stocks, lithium, baby milk powder, retail, TLS and food stocks are all f'd so scratch a line thru 70% of the index

4929 2018-10-19 02:00:35 Check out $ITHUF $MPXEF merger today for an example of some “pot stocks” doing it right. If bio is more your thing look at $GWPH $CRBP. Hard to argue $AAPL is still in a ‘growth’ phase compared to those companies, so yeah I’d rather be invested where the capital flows will be
4930 2018-10-19 02:00:28 Wait! Don’t “dump” all your money into Aurora or any one thing. You’re just kidding, right? Mantra: professional advisor; balanced portfolio; basket of stocks. Trade safe.
4931 2018-10-19 02:00:24 Doing nothing won’t work either. I’m all for comprehensive background checks, including mental health issues, but it will take years to implement. If banning bump stocks and h/c magazines doesn’t work, then we try something else.
4932 2018-10-19 02:00:06 No, not immediately. Those were left over stocks from a long time ago.
4933 2018-10-19 01:59:39 I think this narative is pushed at the moment and not true at all. Imagine if we get the biggest stockmarket crash since the great depression ans BTC functions as a save haven. BTC is somewhere near the beginning of a cycle and stocks are somewhere near the end of a cycle
4934 2018-10-19 01:58:37 So the question is, should my mom totally move out of stocks and into real estate?
4935 2018-10-19 01:57:03 La info de stocks “no” debería ser considerado secreto fiscal - toda vez que hace a la transparencia de los mercados - igual que deberían netear las compras de exportación cuando revenden a mercado interno trigo y maíz - en soja se hace, pasan de Expo a industria @jesilveyra

4937 2018-10-19 01:55:59 I keep watching my 401k going south and my automotive stocks in them down about 30+% now. Just wanted to thank clueless/ criminal Trump for tanking my source of income now that I can’t work due to illness. I know he could care less but I feel better vetting.
4938 2018-10-19 01:54:47 Stocks fell sharply after Treasury Secretary’s statement about skipping  Saudi Arabia conference.Throughout Thursday's session, pulling the Dow  industrial down as much as 471 points at one point Amid Concerns Over  Global Growth.#SUACCF18
4939 2018-10-19 01:53:27 These markets are not crypto-centric. Asset markets are concerned about Chinese stocks, western debt with Euro countries and ultimately U.S. stocks. Not about #crypto right now.
4940 2018-10-19 01:52:06 Are you seriously that in love with your guns that you can’t see the need for some basic safety measures.  Why are militant assault weapons necessary; why bump stocks and large round magazines?  Those are only for killing people.
4941 2018-10-19 01:51:42 Anyway, you have to think long term about stocks to do well IMO. Since I bought Tesla, Google, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Facebook, Priceline ... ALL have destroyed the index. Measure entire holding period. I don’t care much about volatility.
4942 2018-10-19 01:51:16 I have noticed something peculiar. Since mid september, twitter stock experts have stopped recommending individual stocks. Not only for buy, even for sell. 
Most have moved to indices or prefer to keep their mouths shut.

4946 2018-10-19 01:49:26 It costs more to build a house than a year ago because labor is higher. Prices are flatish and stalling out.  Margins got killed and Homebuilder stocks got crushed. I think we’ll find out in the next few quarters that many businesses have not been able to pass on increased costs
4947 2018-10-19 01:49:25 i just listened to the interview,and to set the record straight, when i was asked about gold stocks, my answer was cut off about kl, wdoff, pvg, and paas .
4948 2018-10-19 01:49:20 You have a link? Because the video I saw, that Rush is circulating, has her saying she supports banning bump stocks and high capacity magazines. So...
4949 2018-10-19 01:48:41 All money systems including gold are iou system effectively. People will use what they see as the most stable and convenient. Watch “the ascent of money”. It’s on YouTube. One of he best at describing money, bonds, stocks etc. takes it back to first principles

4954 2018-10-19 01:46:30 That people should stick to buying mutual funds or ETFs and not individual stocks. There's good learning in researching a company and understanding how to buy and sell stocks.

Just kidding...always enjoy your work!
4959 2018-10-19 01:43:25 It’s always difficult to get clients to stick to a small/value tilted portfolio that strongly favors stocks over bonds
But it’s the best thing for their retirement & legacy goals. There’s always something that looks shinier; advisors who promote confidence/discipline = invaluable
4960 2018-10-19 01:43:06 Last time Ron said it was about to bottom out, I cashed out my stocks at Dow 16k and bought a pile of silver. I'm done taking my financial advice from Ron and William Devane.
4961 2018-10-19 01:42:40 Well! My views were totally biased because of me being an investorand would surely add favourite quality stocks for longer term at low levels because as history suggests bears stay for 1 or max 2 years but bulls stay much longer than that

4965 2018-10-19 01:38:35 Stocks operate with a float. Let’s say you’re selling ducks from a pond. You have ten ducks worth $5 a piece. Stock buyback from tax breaks allows the duck farmer to buy 6 ducks at $5 a piece. There are now 4 ducks in the pond, but the price is now $25 a piece. 1/2

4971 2018-10-19 01:35:55 Saying she supports a ban on bump stocks and high capacity magazines is not the same as taking away your guns. So, nope. Try again. Also, try getting your news from someone besides Rush Limbaugh.

If they put away 10% of their wealth they can live comfortably for the rest of their lives.

With the other 90%, they are willing to gamble.

Dollars, stocks, gold...uninteresting....they are willing to try something new.

4984 2018-10-19 01:28:51 So I’m not the only one feeling the tension of the market I haven’t been live trading at all yet because of the market itself so good to know that this is everyone going through this and not just my miscalculation :-) good job on the green!
4985 2018-10-19 01:28:10 I'm old enough to remember when politicians said they were going to ban bump stocks.
4986 2018-10-19 01:28:09 And we exclude the top 250 stocks, the S&P 500 would be *down* this year!! And last year too!!
4987 2018-10-19 01:28:05 Memang kalau takleh kawal emosi, jangan trade stocks.

4988 2018-10-19 01:27:02 seeing CSI 300 open 0.9% lower, Shcomp down 1.1%. Talk of large insurers being ordered to buy stocks may see buyers emerge
4989 2018-10-19 01:27:02 Little has been done to make schools safer & should not be a partisan issue. For @NancyPelosi to say the Dems will take guns is wrong, but we have to do something. By eliminating bump stocks & high capacity magazines. While it won’t stop shootings, it would minimize the carnage.
4990 2018-10-19 01:25:11 @jimcramer is it worth holding or selling weed stocks?? Thanks!
4991 2018-10-19 01:24:54 2/3 in 2000 u could have had anyone in the seat republican or dem and they couldn’t have changed what happened. Overbought tech stocks and bubble bursted, plus u add 9/11 into the mix and that doesn’t help no matter who is sitting president.
4992 2018-10-19 01:22:42 Dengar member almost loss 30k trade stocks ni menguatkan lg reason kenapa aku tak invest dlm stocks. Aku tak rasa aku boleh handle that kind of emotion. Tak kira la rugi/untung.
4993 2018-10-19 01:22:30 It's so amusing to hear about someone worrying about me talking about me, when I have never given them a second thought, stocks go up and down easy stick the boot in when they happen to be down, we will see how it ends, meantime focus on family that's whats important..
4994 2018-10-19 01:22:25 If the stocks take a turn down, than im putting my money on gold going up!
4995 2018-10-19 01:20:51 hahahahaha I fucking love my stocks
4996 2018-10-19 01:20:03 Yeah. Exactly the point I'm tryin to get across. 
None of these stocks are in a hold area.
And all of them are having their charts fucked forever.

5000 2018-10-19 01:16:25 @WolfOfWeedST Mr. Wolf, which are your favourite three pot stocks if you had to choose?
5001 2018-10-19 01:15:15 it will be impossible to control banned firearms and "bump-stocks". A background check cannot find a deprave mind.
5002 2018-10-19 01:15:08 You turned me on to pot stocks around this time last year. Bought CGC around $13 and sold around $50. Much obliged!
5003 2018-10-19 01:15:02 The thing is though, he doesn’t just have that money readily available. It’s tied up in stocks and partner companies. He can’t just pay all that money out of his bank account. That’s not how it works. Not saying he couldn’t invest it towards things like this though
5004 2018-10-19 01:15:02 Real thing overheard from a coworker: ”how come they can tell us all these pointless sports stats but can’t tell us what stocks r gonna do?”

5009 2018-10-19 01:12:03 @ZinXO @jpagp quick question, once BPNYSE hits 30% and show sign of reversal, would you target one of the stocks in this 30% for port?
5010 2018-10-19 01:12:03 @rick_holl @jpagp That means there weren’t stocks trading above their Bullish Support Line, their trend was negative.

5050 2018-10-19 00:43:22 It’s always a challenge. People were quitting their jobs to trade tech stocks in the 1990s. Enron employees and others lost their job and all their money betting on their company. But preventing this in no way justifies an adviser saying he deserves a cut of the “adviser Alpha”.

5055 2018-10-19 00:40:25 Hi @timothysykes !  I am watching your youtube videos, and I have been watching stocks for the las months, I had some trades, but I want to dig more into it!  What DVD do you recomand and where can I buy it from?
Also how can I get the scanner program? Thank you!
5056 2018-10-19 00:38:48 They’ll probably push for “universal” background checks (aka making private sales illegal) and probably an assault weapons ban.

I’m opposed to both, but the Trumpists voted for a guy who banned bump stocks, sooooo in my eyes they’ve lost the right to bitch.
5057 2018-10-19 00:38:24 You seem like the only billionaire that would answer this question. But do you literally have all your money in a bank? Or in assets aka stocks/real estate. Lmao that would be cool checking your bank account and seeing 1 bil.
5058 2018-10-19 00:38:23 It sure is, get them while stocks last. Here in Los Angeles at my local store, there were 3 left in stock and I grabbed one
5059 2018-10-19 00:38:17 The company was fined. By purchasing stocks, the company loses overall value. His money is then pays the fine. It would be like me buying your watch so you have money to pay bail.
5060 2018-10-19 00:37:58 I'm curious, who are the dumbasses selling stocks into this economic recovery?

5066 2018-10-19 00:33:40 The NRA gives McCaskill an F because they don’t want background checks, but wants bump-stocks, high capacity magazines, and AR-15’s. Please tell the truth regarding why the NRA doesn’t like McCaskill.

5069 2018-10-19 00:30:22 Conversations with several investors who say stocks higher if Fed pauses rate hikes in ‘19.  Disagree. Fed pause signals “growing but slowing” becoming simply “slowing”. Multiples decline. Spreads widen. @rcwhalen @DiMartinoBooth @realvision
5070 2018-10-19 00:30:15 I agree, but since he is licensed advisor, the SEC can take action against him. Every financial advisor must disclose all outside business to prevent conflict. Subscribers (myself included) pay him for stocks and crypto (lack of) service $DIG

5075 2018-10-19 00:26:51 Diffrence between crypto and stocks.  Anything goes in crypto.
5076 2018-10-19 00:26:48 I do have a fantasy, though, of retiring early and trading stocks for a living. I *think* I'd be good at it
5077 2018-10-19 00:26:06 We are NOT here for @AGJoshHawley's stigmatization of mental health and mental illnesses and disorders in the #MoSenateDebate. When asked how he would approach the gun violence epidemic, he only spoke of mental illness & said nothing of the NRA, bump stocks, or automatic weapons.
5078 2018-10-19 00:25:05 Show us the stocks you invest in.
5079 2018-10-19 00:24:49 Still way cheaper than some Li/Co stocks but much better FA. Underlying commodity more structural. Surprised it's so bogged down
5080 2018-10-19 00:24:37 .@HawleyMO can claim @clairecmc wants to take away 2nd Amendment rights all he wants but he has never and will never be able to offer one scintilla of evidence of that. Period. She is for #GunSafety measures like banning bump stocks, not disarming citizens. #mosenatedebate
5081 2018-10-19 00:24:07 @jimcramer What do you think of ERIC @ericsson ??? I’m trying to get out ahead 5G tech stocks.  Any other recommendations for 5G?
5082 2018-10-19 00:24:07 I've said from day one that bump stocks actually saved lives in Vegas
5083 2018-10-19 00:23:24 @clairecmc said that she supports gun safety and the second amendment. “I support universal background checks. I support banning bump stocks.” McCaskill said. #mosenatedebate @KOMUnews
5084 2018-10-19 00:23:23 Mortgage rates edge lower this week. Economic growth to ease in 2019. U.S. Stocks see an uptick in volatility this week.
5085 2018-10-19 00:23:14 #MoSen debate:
@clairecmc: @NRA believes @HawleyMO 'will toe their line and be against universal background checks, against a ban on bump stocks...'
@HawleyMO: 'She wants to take away 2nd Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.'
5086 2018-10-19 00:22:50 Good idea
5087 2018-10-19 00:22:22 I like to buy cheap. So I look at current IV of stocks and compare to historical. That way I know if premiums are mispriced and then I choose setups out of a basket of 8 stocks that I follow and know. If the set up is there I take it. If not I wait.
5088 2018-10-19 00:22:12 Striking in @clairecmc's answer on guns, how often she's invoking the NRA, betting they are a bogeyman, even in Missouri. She supports universal background checks & banning bump stocks.

#MOSEN
5089 2018-10-19 00:21:12 Claire, please explain your desire to take away all semi automatic rifles. Trump already banned bump stocks and it is going thru regulatory hoops. #MoSenateDeabte
5090 2018-10-19 00:21:08 “I support universal background checks. I support banning bump stocks.”
-@clairecmc
#MoSenateDebate
5091 2018-10-19 00:20:56 Claire knows you can support the Second Amendment and common sense gun safety. That's why she supports universal background checks, banning bump stocks, and no fly no buy. #mosen #MoSenateDebate
5092 2018-10-19 00:20:54 McCaskill-Hawley Debate
Talking about gun control now.
Hawley: blah, blah, blah GOP usual rhetoric, believes 2nd amendment.
McCaskill: gun safety measures, no bump stocks, accuses GOP of being afraid of NRA
5093 2018-10-19 00:20:52 McCaskill: "I support universal background checks... I support banning bump stocks." Says the NRA stands in the way from that happening. #MoSenateDebate
5094 2018-10-19 00:20:09 I'm alone in my house 
I'm out on the town 
I'm at the bottom of the bottle 
Brett stocks been knockin' them down… (@howling_ghosts )
5095 2018-10-19 00:18:39 A2: right now, nothing. But anytime I invest in individual stocks, I'm constantly freaking out about their underperformance. So now I just avoid them and stick with indexing #TomorrowTalk
5096 2018-10-19 00:18:23 'Nearology' plays in biotech stocks are ridiculous.
5097 2018-10-19 00:18:06 The Downsview Plaza NSLC in Lower Sackville has closed its cannabis section an hour earlier than normal tonight, because the store was experiencing an 'inventory shortage'. The NSLC says it is expecting a delivery overnight to replenish stocks. @CTVAtlantic
5098 2018-10-19 00:17:28 #LUBxUC | Final 1T: @Club_Atenas 48 @clubgoesoficial 36. Llegó a tener 15 de renta el locatario, Álex López aportó ofensivamente y atrás no dio franquicias. El Misionero descontó con la dupla Stocks-Enano, pero un buen reingreso de Henry le devolvió rentas al ateniense.
5099 2018-10-19 00:17:24 While shares are the most commonly traded security, you can also trade a wide range of other securities through online brokers. Also consider whether you want access to international stocks. #OnlineTrading #OnlineInvesting #Brokerage #Stocks
5100 2018-10-19 00:17:02 He’s old and irrelevant so he has to make noise. Let’s put him in the Royal stocks and throw rotten eggs at him. Or slim him on tv.
5101 2018-10-19 00:16:50 Yep...tough time to be in the market with this Fed planned volatility... the swings are insane ...strange how banking stocks stay stable while #NASDAQ gets hammered ... they may have created a safe haven for banker gang right in plain sight
5102 2018-10-19 00:16:48 October aka the month that Chase stocks up on Boo Berry cereal.
5103 2018-10-19 00:16:16 Dude, stocks up, tax down, spending up=success . Ignore the 17% deficit increase this year alone. No wonder DT is freaking at the Fed, this “success” is costing big time!!
5104 2018-10-19 00:15:18 Can you actually tell me more about how VC FA works? I've only ever used it when picking stocks
5105 2018-10-19 00:15:08 W Hi, we do understand where you're coming from. Worry not, we're working to replenish our stocks at the soonest possible time. Just stay tuned for our further announcements.

5107 2018-10-19 00:14:52 Ahh, you got the goods on McCaskill.  She wants to ban bump stocks and high capacity magazine lookalike assault weapons used to slaughter our kids in our schools and used in mass murders of Americans.  What a relief to know how "subversive" she is trying to save American lives.
5108 2018-10-19 00:14:33 IMHO, with all these bio stocks popping left, right and centre..., check your charts, place your bids at the lowest level and if you miss it...move on, there's always the next trade!
5109 2018-10-19 00:14:16 Everyone buying lottery tickets.. why not get some penny stocks instead peasants.. #imbuyingsometootho
5110 2018-10-19 00:14:02 A well balanced portfolio should include:

5112 2018-10-19 00:13:33 Too bad I'm in Canada I'd use my Robert Parker stocks but they won't give Me them
5113 2018-10-19 00:13:29 Thanks dude
5114 2018-10-19 00:13:01 I truly feel that learning the long side of stocks first is more beneficial than the short side
5115 2018-10-19 00:12:38 I will buy them! thank you for your concern but why do you care so much about exo and other kpop group's stocks. Surely you have better things to do like focusing on your faves
5116 2018-10-19 00:12:00 It’s very corporate... 

He wasn’t fired, his position was eliminated.

It wasn’t a massive layoff, it was a right sizing.

Stocks didn’t tank, we had a market correction.
5117 2018-10-19 00:11:25 Ils vont bientôt couler de toute façon, c'est une question de temps. Ils arrivent à peine à écouler leurs stocks vu le nombre d'annulations
Par contre méfiez-vous ils gardent 10% du prix se la statue en arrhes peu importe ce que vous avez déjà payé ces escrocs
5118 2018-10-19 00:11:15 No. These rallies all go like this:

-I’m great. I’m the best.
-Stocks are up for miklionairws
-tremendous winning 
-lock her up
-fake news
-insult a female or black people 
-insult immigrants
-democrats are causing cancer
-bigly lies

5119 2018-10-19 00:10:35 @RonnieMoas is a financial advisor with over 600 stocks recommended in the past 10 years so the SEC can step in when a licensed advisor behave like the he had with $DIG
5120 2018-10-19 00:10:16 Will Duff actually said that instead of addressing gun violence CT needs to “man up” and address violence in general. 

He also voted to keep bump stocks legal in CT @raghibct points out “Even Donald Trump is against bump stocks.”
5121 2018-10-19 00:09:53 True, wonder how many will keep their profits after the inevitable crash decimates those stocks? Ahh, their okay, know a few of them here. Just need a kick in the a** once in a while.
5122 2018-10-19 00:09:45 Since yesterday's "great" labour force release, the AUD is down, stocks are down, interest rates are down. 
So much for either fundamentals as market drivers in the short run, or
... the numbers are as useful a guide to the economy as shopping mall car parks during new year sales
5123 2018-10-19 00:09:18 Masterpiece Sport from all planned to go to recover but entered knew look rather Amazing also stocks Gone contains accompany sound to enter.

5125 2018-10-19 00:09:01 @MikeEdward_TTG Mike, do you usually get into a stock with a limit or market order.  Market can be difficult with fast moving stocks.  Also, what did you use today to get into $CCCL?  Thanks man.  See you in chat tomorrow!
5126 2018-10-19 00:06:57 I cant say anything about their #robotics but i saw strange thing with their CEO and their stocks. #TRXC
5127 2018-10-19 00:06:29 Asia stocks begin negative after the tech-led stock rout resumed on Wall St amid on going rate hike concerns and following the prior day's sell-off in China; ASX 200 (-0.7%), Nikkei 225 (-1.5%), KOSPI (-0.8%)
5128 2018-10-19 00:06:12 If Canadians own cannabis stocks, we can be refused entry into the US. If a former prime minister sits on the board of an American pot company, that's OK? Somebody please explain this to me.
5129 2018-10-19 00:05:02 @jpagp off 500 stocks isn’t representative of the whole NYSE. Use the whole stock market instead.
5130 2018-10-19 00:03:58 US stocks fell as rising bond yields and worries on the US-China trade war overshadowed better than expected corporate earnings results. #USTracker #morninghuddle
5131 2018-10-19 00:03:11 Wow, someone who agrees with my view on bank stocks which i increased holdings of about a month or two ago.  Nice to see i am in good company, maybe !
5132 2018-10-19 00:02:39 You're way off, it's not possible to buy stocks at too high a price.
