13 2018-04-02 23:58:11 I'm the first to admit I'm not fully versed on these crypto currencies. What is a fact so far is there have been major breeches on the systems already, hacking, not much accountability afterwards. And what backs the real value of them. All a little speculative.

80 2018-04-02 23:51:25 Strange thing, I was doing some craniosacral therapy palpation on the health of crypto (weird I know) and ETH showed that it would grow strong and slow, pump, dip, pump again then fade away, all the other coins tested showed 2 big pumps like Dec/Jan, bigger scale, huge momentum.

114 2018-04-02 23:46:25 I feel like an idiot many times a day. And I still do not like crypto even though it is cool. 

I am usually a fashion cycle or three behind.
115 2018-04-02 23:46:18 One good thing about getting started in crypto in 2018. You get to learn the TA and FA to make money rather just get in on a pump n dump or got it on a bull market. 

But It would be nice tho. 
#cryptoconfessions #learntoearn
116 2018-04-02 23:46:16 Yes but there are very few smart people investing in crypto and who actually research the crypto they invest in so most of your words fall on deaf ears. Always blaming you for their decision to act on your advice. Keep up the positivity.
117 2018-04-02 23:46:15 I've heard of it... but I'm thinking bigger.
118 2018-04-02 23:45:54 Ill  buy $ETH at 325 down maybe just maybe 350
119 2018-04-02 23:45:45 Sorry man saying that led me to unfollow for sure don't need negativity and new ppl questioning crypto right now. Hope everything works out for you.

148 2018-04-02 23:39:14 There are certainly some short term gains possible, but it is a long-term play if you are looking at crypto as an investment. I make this qualification because some crypto is positioned as digital cash for daily transactions and payments -- such as @Dashpay.

171 2018-04-02 23:36:06 I think we need to be more understanding of new people in the crypto space & educate them. There is just so much false information out there and some of the well-known people are only shilling shit for egocentric reasons.

195 2018-04-02 23:33:08 Agreed, @hedgeconnect1 is proving their worth, credibility & professionalism & building trust by way of working through all the headwinds (tech issues,hacks,Ddos,FUD,etc). IMO primary ? remaining is the change in business plan,we invested in crypto 'hedge fund', we need clarity!
196 2018-04-02 23:33:05 I sold $ACBFF stocks 5 days ago and I am still waiting on my money to get deposited into my account. Sold $BTC yesterday and the cash is in my account. This is why Blockchain will win in the long run. #Blockchain #cryptocurrency #Bitcoin #BTC #crypto
197 2018-04-02 23:32:59 Another interesting idea...

People say investing in crypto is basically gambling.

What if you could gamble with your crypto? An online crypto gambling platform... hmmm

Think about it... who would like something like that? 

Comment your thoughts.
198 2018-04-02 23:32:56 Said the same when I posted the vid on my social media, following my own rant on this scam. I don't share the crypto skepticism, but that's exactly what happens thanks to ICOs like this and that's why it's in our all interest to block all individuals affiliated from the industry.

201 2018-04-02 23:32:02 awesome high quality content as always. ty bro!  appreciate the after editing w/ charts and articles for the smooth viewing experience. doubt my guess is good for much lol but I’d say 1.32 trillion. I suppose if stocks take a hit, so will disposable flow into crypto.
202 2018-04-02 23:32:01 Good looking out! I'll give the fellow crypto friends a follow.
203 2018-04-02 23:31:49 It is nice to see the SEC taking down the scams. Imagine the money lost as a result of this? Leaving a bad taste in a lot of people's mouths on crypto as a whole.
204 2018-04-02 23:31:23 Read the WhitePaper, the use-case of the token is bassicly for inside money transfering. The users won't really buy/trade/hold GET. The other use-case is to buy drinks as festivals - which is more complicated than it sounds (read WP)

227 2018-04-02 23:27:57 have actually heard this from 3-4 diff somewhat reliable sources now
228 2018-04-02 23:27:52 Literally the first thing I read on their website, "No need to fear, you're only entrusting your hard-earned ETH to an algorithmic robot accountant running on a decentralized blockchain network"

230 2018-04-02 23:26:56 This is really good 
231 2018-04-02 23:26:45 This got me thinking:
'Crypto will definitely but slowly change the psychology of spending. If your money has it's value increase with time, there is less motivation to spend and one would think twice before buying. Less accumulation -> Minimal living'
232 2018-04-02 23:26:43 Even thinking about Bcash is insanity ;)

237 2018-04-02 23:26:00 Heh, i’m not sure we’d agree on this stuff. I think crypto ends up being pretty centralized as well. Take a look at my tweets from the last 24h.

I think a lot of pro-crypto people fail to acknowledge how centralized cryptos are - dev team and miners hold almost all control.

242 2018-04-02 23:25:35 Bad move indeed!! #crypto #investresponsibly
243 2018-04-02 23:24:31 It does not feels right. In Japan consumer knows much more about crypto then any other country. The chart you created (someone created) does not look real. Paccoin has no future. You need to change the strategy of you team, if you have any:(
244 2018-04-02 23:24:30 Request Network team seems to be one of the most reliable/consistent in the space.  Am i mistaken, or are they really the only truly decentralized accounts and payments platform around?   They recently embraced blockchain agnosticism.  They deserve more attention.

293 2018-04-02 23:17:13 It sounds like you were better prepared than me in that case so fairplay to you 

I made gains alright but nowhere near what I could've due to inexperience, so now this is prep time 
294 2018-04-02 23:16:50 I agree. I don’t think it will overtake BTC bc of scarcasity but each have their own use case. I see the potential of retail use for cryptocurrencies like ProCurrency. Putting on my investor hat, I think ultimately it will close to the USD, $1-2 max, about 50x-100x ROI from here.
295 2018-04-02 23:16:46 It’s appeared very legit on the surface. I’m happy to see they’re taking the scams seriously. That’s good for crypto.
296 2018-04-02 23:16:34 You could say they got knocked out!
297 2018-04-02 23:16:24 Dude.. I dare say maybe 90% of anyone in crypto just now is in it for profit, ... trust me, kaz is the 1 and only weatherman... whoever you are tongue punching in the fart box... I can guarantee they were probably educated by Kaz.
298 2018-04-02 23:16:08 No but I also believe the same hedge fund managers who run stocks ie warren buffet etc will clear up in crypto it will bounce up n down it’s algorithm and big banks who own your ass now pretend it’s decentralised 
299 2018-04-02 23:15:52 Guilty -  a while ago now though!
300 2018-04-02 23:15:46 I don't see how that's related to showing off some guy's setup for mining crypto though
301 2018-04-02 23:15:45 @Tom2634 is this the company you rented cars from in the past?
302 2018-04-02 23:15:45 everybody is shorting Bitcoin...both crypto enthusiasts and Bitcoin futures people...I'm gone laugh my ass off when it goes up instead.

305 2018-04-02 23:15:25 副業や不労所得と言うと、何故だか簡単に稼げるかのように思う人が多いですよね。サラリーマンのように時間の切り売りで稼ぐわけではないから、それ相応に努力しないと稼げないというのに。

309 2018-04-02 23:15:13 These are developments of things in the works. There's no timeline because it's too early and still many variables to be considered. But these things are in motion.

318 2018-04-02 23:14:14 PayPal, Bitcoin, and a number of others have proven that digital and crypto-currencies can wedge themselves into the mainstream where banks and governments accept their value.  TBC is the first “Abundance-Based” currency it too will be recognized as a real value by the banks
319 2018-04-02 23:14:14 I respectfully disagree. To me November to January felt like sitting on my bags and watching them go up 10-100x relative to bitcoin. All I had to do was buy good projects at cheap prices. No fancy charting necessary
320 2018-04-02 23:14:07 That’s some powerful powerful FUD

328 2018-04-02 23:12:57 This is the least interesting part of crypto to me.  It's utterly predictable.

341 2018-04-02 23:11:05 Those were crazy euphoric-depressing days and u r right crypto feels similar.
342 2018-04-02 23:11:03 My take on this whole thing is "yawn, I told you so, and so did a bunch of people.  If you raise a lot of money and break the law along the way the SEC and a bunch of other people may come after you.  Big frigging surprise."
343 2018-04-02 23:10:42 I’m liking #Stellar Lumens $XLM #XLM as an asset and competitor to #ETH right now. I’ve been seeing more projects wanting to build on it. It’s up 15% for the past week. It's 1.48x it’s 200 day SMA. 2x the current price is possible, and that would be around half the ATH. #crypto

356 2018-04-02 23:09:02 Same here. But it is sometimes difficult, especially if you have a job and a family with kids. You really need to scrape up your spare time, to fill it with nothing.
Crypto e.g. was/is a big distraction for me.

Anyhow, if you persevere your kids will profit, it's epigenetics.

368 2018-04-02 23:07:48 Not exactly lying is sort of the MO of half the players in different areas of traditional markets. But they usually just get a slap, or nothing...
369 2018-04-02 23:07:46 Actually I wouldn't be the slightest bit surprised, given that we are about to experience the spending power of our dollar decrease like we've never seen in history. Once the inflation really hits and our fiat is almost worthless why not give the paper away to us. #Crypto

372 2018-04-02 23:07:10 The cryptography of most cryptocurrencies can be changed relatively easily so I don’t think being quantum resistant at this point in time gives much, if any, advantage

450 2018-04-02 22:56:45 Exactly. This ain’t the same market as it was a few years ago. Can’t even compare because of the volume.
451 2018-04-02 22:56:44 K, thanks for clarification
452 2018-04-02 22:56:43 Jimmy is so biased its not even funny. Saying how Bitcoin is the only decentralised currency? lol. get the fuck out. Its all controlled by blockstream. Not to mention ETH has the most amount of devs and is also highly decentralised and ASIC resistant. @jimmysong is all wrong.
453 2018-04-02 22:56:38 Yeah but bitcoin isn’t creating huge sell pressure by giving away coins for free that cannot currently be used for anything else. Big if true but I’m pretty dubious tbh

507 2018-04-02 22:47:32 Brad let the whiners be, crypto to a large degree is the IQ test of the internet, those scream “moon” “Lambo” and “scam” clearly fail. They need to go buy some #bcash and some oxy and be done with it. #fomo2017 “investors” unfortunately are a necessary evil.

510 2018-04-02 22:46:20 I love the results from googling this number. All these fake ass 'support' accounts for every exchange, all deleted. I guess you're trying again huh? Maybe you should try something else, like actually buying crypto
511 2018-04-02 22:46:19 I think one of the main issues with crypto right now, specifically #alts is that you have so many coins/tokens that have no working product and are worth $1,$2,$10 just because they have a low total circulating supply. Just the hype of their white paper.
512 2018-04-02 22:46:14 How about a gang war, let the bag holders fight defending their shitcoins.

572 2018-04-02 22:37:47 Ok ok you talked me into it
573 2018-04-02 22:37:35 Not me
574 2018-04-02 22:37:16 If I ever tweet something that offends you, GFY. Put on your big kid pants and get over it. 

P.s.

I love you 
575 2018-04-02 22:37:11 Can someone pour 100bil in to #btc please where are those so called ^ institutional Investors ^  #bitcoin #crypto #cardano #litecoin #eth #vechain #wanchain #credits #verge #ripple #trac #zilliqa #nano #hodl #monero #tron
576 2018-04-02 22:37:06 I’m meant to be interviewing the top guy over there so will ask him some questions before I comment on them.
577 2018-04-02 22:37:03 I've been super conflicted lately.  One part of me wants to trade in nearly ALL of my #Altcoins and just buy #Bitcoin, paper wallet it and HODL.  No worry of keeping my #crypto in an exchange, no hackers, no worries.

My problem?  I just have too much faith in #BNB #ENG and #TRX.
578 2018-04-02 22:37:03 Have you seen his website. He charges $25000 for a 3 day Crypto boot camp 
Online version costs $3995
Shameless overcharging.
579 2018-04-02 22:36:50 This has been an accelerated process compared to 2013. Recovery inside of 2018 
580 2018-04-02 22:36:50 @Haejin_Crypto hey Heajin could you do another analysis for BNB/BTC after the recent run or could you give me feedback to an analysis if I send you one?
581 2018-04-02 22:36:47 No one is REQUIRING anything. Knowing how to generate your own private keys is taking full sovereignty over your money. Financial sovereignty is what this movement is about. The entire promise of crypto is that people don't HAVE TO rely on anyone else to keep their money safe.
582 2018-04-02 22:36:41 Thanks, I’m not your average twitter shill. Joking aside though, Merchant/PROC integration is being added now. Right now you can buy from Walmart and other stores from the list directly from their websites in USD and get a rebate in ProCurrency.
583 2018-04-02 22:36:40 Excited to see these men fist each other
584 2018-04-02 22:36:31 Je suis ému 
J'hésite à rentrer tout de suite ou continuer à espérer ce fameux 0.005. Comme chiffre rond c'est pas mal quand même ^^
585 2018-04-02 22:36:27 He's talking about me boxing Bitlord mate. Nobody wants to fight you! You'll wipe the floor with us!
586 2018-04-02 22:36:14 Crypto Twitter is already a drama pool just about every day now....  so bring it!
587 2018-04-02 22:36:07 nice but I got out of it last month for more crypto lol Congrats!!!
588 2018-04-02 22:36:03 比較的リスクなしで、 始めることができるのは最高ですが、全員が稼げるわけではないこと考えないといけないですね。人によったもっと効率的な副業も存在するので、煽り信じたらいけませんね。

601 2018-04-02 22:34:32 $crypto twitter is a amazing tool to observe sentiment. To gauge how the community is feeling. Euphoria, greed, FOMO, despair etc.
602 2018-04-02 22:34:15 Ok these I like 
603 2018-04-02 22:33:58 These would look great AND hide the fact that I’m missing an ear!!
604 2018-04-02 22:33:52 @RealSexyCyborg make a setup to receive #Bitcoin or other #crypto, we are with you after the frauds at @VICE.
605 2018-04-02 22:33:48 The problem I see is even if based in Wyoming, a crypto biz could not market to residents of the other 49 US states unless also complying with their rules, so overall benefits are pretty minimal when compared to Switzerland or other simpler/safer jurisdictions
606 2018-04-02 22:33:42 Uisright
607 2018-04-02 22:33:42 not another crypto tweet - geezus
608 2018-04-02 22:33:06 @BMO If I was denied purchasing crypto with my credit card, you can bet my ass id pull every cent from that bank and move elsewhere. You cant stop the adoption.
609 2018-04-02 22:32:36 It's starting to look ugly. Might see some of the money filter into the crypto markets. Could be a blessing in disguise for crypto.
610 2018-04-02 22:32:19 そうなると嬉しいですね！ただ、逆もしかりですね(´༎ຶོρ༎ຶོ`)
611 2018-04-02 22:32:16 Nope, too soon
612 2018-04-02 22:32:13 At this time I don’t have one...
613 2018-04-02 22:32:01 I believe $ZIL will end up in the top 5 on coinmarket cap, don't really want to predict prices and whats going to happen, crypto needs new money. It'll be one of the years best for sure.
614 2018-04-02 22:31:49 "I don't want this twitter to be a drama pool... but here's more drama for the drama pool..."

The both of you are giving black eyes to each other & the crypto community. It's not good for the "children" to see. They're going to grow up thinking this is what crypto is all about.
615 2018-04-02 22:31:40 
616 2018-04-02 22:31:38 Go buy something from Walmart with proc tokens and get back to me. Your shill is above average though, can probably get some mongs to pump it.
617 2018-04-02 22:31:36 The moon is artificial.
618 2018-04-02 22:31:27 Yep. Only crypto i would go all is LTC. If my risk appetite was low then maybe BTC. Note I am not all in but LTC does make up the majority of my portfolio.
619 2018-04-02 22:31:27 damn I missed your entry. good luck!
620 2018-04-02 22:31:26 With which #crypto would you want to pay your #travel? We will already implement #BTC, #ETH, #XMR, #LTC, #XRP, #DASH and #BCH. What's next? Vote for your favorite coin, the one with the most votes will be added on the booking website.
621 2018-04-02 22:31:15 Was a joke. But any how where I am at Ppl like you wouldn't matter or probably get ur b!tch ass robbed and your thumb cut off and ur crop taken.
622 2018-04-02 22:31:14 Didn't take long for Bitcoiners to divide their "citizens" into "classes" lol
623 2018-04-02 22:31:12 #google and #Facebook are like those asshole ‘popular’ kids who made fun of the ‘weirdkid’ and banned their friends from doing things the ‘weirdkid’ did. Then the asshole kid would do the same thing  later, and make it sound ‘better’

634 2018-04-02 22:29:34 Not condoning buying crypto by any means just FYI but I think it would be somewhat foolish not to explore possibilities this year. You never want to fight anything new, ok to be subjective but unwise to be ignorant.
635 2018-04-02 22:29:30 Best Christmas EVER followed by the worst quarter EVER!!! 
636 2018-04-02 22:29:29 Hands down every tweet has positive words to #crypto community 
637 2018-04-02 22:29:20 1. Everything handles transactions. 2. Cardano does not have smart contracts and likely won’t until 2019 at the earliest. 3. So ridiculous that I do not even know where to start.
638 2018-04-02 22:29:12 TBC is a fully decentralized crypto-currency just like Bitcoin, yet TBC is the 1st “Abundance-based” currency in the world.

647 2018-04-02 22:27:49 #bitcoin will be at 40k USD minimum, by the end of this year. The real question is, will you have any? #crypto #cryptocurency
648 2018-04-02 22:27:36 This the part where you look them over from head to toe, then from toe to head. Look them in the , smirk , then continue walking down your successful crypto path...and never look back. 
649 2018-04-02 22:27:35 Trade Ideas besides all of the stocks, has a Crypto Stocks channel of backtesting scans that are blockchain related. All of the altcoins on the major crypoto exchanges are being coded into the platform as we speak. So this should be coming very soon.
650 2018-04-02 22:27:07 If you have any interest in the crypto space I’m on a team in NC that needs people, but would also love to advocate for you to a more spatially convenient team. Any public projects?

658 2018-04-02 22:25:41 Cardano because of these 3 parts:
1. Cardano SL which handles transactions like Bitcoin.
2. Cardano CL handles smart contacts like ethereum.    3. Haskell: not widely known so hacking will be difficult.  This just scratches the surface
659 2018-04-02 22:25:38 Those that sold all for fiat in Jan or After the big bounce in Feb, you all are in a minority. PAT YOURSELF on your back PROTECTING YOUR CAPITAL and not being sheeps to these fucking twitter/youtube SHILLERS. Some crypto you-tubers are also done for. lol $btc #crypto

682 2018-04-02 22:22:41 That's the closest category I would fall under.  However, I'm starting to second guess my faith in $TRX achieving a global status. Neither him, nor his protocol, appeal to the western cultures, thus far. I don't see that changing anytime soon. Another crypto will overtake him.
683 2018-04-02 22:22:40 Haha  oh Skins “The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing...”- Jack Kerouac

689 2018-04-02 22:21:55 True. Holochain does not have a currency, therefore it doesn't have a currency white paper.

849 2018-04-02 22:01:27 This plays out way too much...

Some person: "In this blog post or Github repository I demonstrate how to design and implement [some homebrew cryptographic algorithm]..."

Me, after 30 seconds skimming: "Here's N vulnerabilities. This is why you shouldn't roll your own crypto."
850 2018-04-02 22:01:21 So it was written by @Haejin_Crypto so let it be done . Love your work @Haejin_Crypto

873 2018-04-02 21:58:09 Thank you @SnickerBacka ! You're right on! Unfortunately people are either not aware or don't care because they're hoping to make quick money. The morals of crypto are completely violated by Ripple. /HighFive for seeing them for what they are!
874 2018-04-02 21:58:09 thank you !
875 2018-04-02 21:58:07 @Crypto_Bitlord sort the match out I'm taking this puta on

877 2018-04-02 21:57:57 Erik's tweet does represent a multi-coiner view; but if you are also for competition from altcoins/forks + their ability to drive innovation - how's your perspective any more or less different than his? Both seem in support of multiple blockchains/crypto assets. @ErikVoorhees
878 2018-04-02 21:57:46 Ahhaha ongoing $LTC #Litecoin #CryptoDrama ~ ego doesn’t look good + this doesn’t look good on the #crypto community. Not that I’d believe small followings have impact but if it did, would harm what you’re trying to promote. C’mon. Let’s be human.

880 2018-04-02 21:57:37 I agree, I hope to eventually get back to all of them 
Mining is most relevant to me rn though thanks man
881 2018-04-02 21:57:32 It's an honor to have you in BLB family. Thank you ML!
882 2018-04-02 21:57:29 Which Crypto are you just purely liking right now... even if it’s not likely to be a big hit?

I’m kinda loving the sound of CUBE right now.
883 2018-04-02 21:57:06 美人です！
884 2018-04-02 21:57:06 If you are thinking about getting into btc or altcoin trading:

1. Formulate a security system around your crypto assets. 

2. Pick a stable exchange to trade. Start small. For example, $20/50/100.

3. Pick solid projects. I personally pick projects that I understand the tech.
885 2018-04-02 21:56:56 The most relevant piece of information in that article: “...but concedes that if the technology advances enough, there’s still a possibility they could create a new system that dramatically improves people’s lives.”
886 2018-04-02 21:56:49 how about nano?

891 2018-04-02 21:55:36 Such info. Much help.
892 2018-04-02 21:55:30 Yes that is Repetitive to you and me. But you have to understand banks, governments, regulators, potential new costumers, Are not looking up crypto news.

As i know what Vanos is, hydraulic advance timing, Most people would not have a clue.

I would pic a easy way to explain
893 2018-04-02 21:55:27 But you’re throwing away money to be “comfortable” ?
894 2018-04-02 21:55:15 I really believe $IPBC is going places.  Follow @ipbc_dev for updates etc...AND, when I followed, they gave me 1 $IPBC.  It's not much right now, but who doesn't like receiving free LEGIT crypto?

904 2018-04-02 21:54:09 So many people are using crypto as a store of wealth. So taxes are only going to effect withdrawals. We should see a horizontal scaling of crypto ready products, in line with the vertical growth, so the tax man doesn't clamp down hard.

There are too many people who want us to believe they know everything in the crypto space but I would rather follow somebody who has made mistakes, accepted them, and learned from them. I am new to this scene but have high hopes

918 2018-04-02 21:52:21 And this is how it should work. Why are „we” (blockchain enthusiasts) so hostile to each other? I don’t mean this particullar thread, but the whole crypto world?

920 2018-04-02 21:52:14 In fairness litecoin isn’t trash, just way overvalued imo. It has a use case and a small amount of adoption. Dark net market places use it a fair amount, much more so than monero for example...

The "narrative" you might perceive as overwhelming is really the tiniest vocal minority.

962 2018-04-02 21:45:05 Keep an eye on the stock market and the Dow Jones. If there's a recession coming, crypto might even get lower (or higher, who knows), but I think $300 is still way to expensive. Price is just perception.

983 2018-04-02 21:42:04 crypto is a commodity, security, property, and all of it, requires regulation from all government agencies, and you pay max tax on all things u do with crypto (sales tax, trading tax, etc. etc.), lol.

995 2018-04-02 21:40:20 So, in the last 120 days, $LFIN came public as a FinTech play, then became a Crypto play by acquiring a Blockchain company that Meenavalli owned and is now a physical commodities trader that is losing money. Sounds about right.

1145 2018-04-02 21:14:53 A neutral crypto news source is like BigFoot. Some claim to have seen it, some are fascinated by it, but most think it's just a myth. The quantity of bias and fud and even outright lies coming from the biggest crypto "news sources" is astonishing. Coindesk had ads for bitconnect.
1146 2018-04-02 21:14:49 I'll take this over another 50% dump. Which I see still very possible
1147 2018-04-02 21:14:44 So alt season is never? 
1148 2018-04-02 21:14:44 No, that's what he says he did, don't believe everything you read, his resume is exaggerated.  He was a former crypto comms guy & pushed out of the IC then worked at the naval college as a professor until his piss poor OPSEC made him vulnerable to a foreign honey trap & got fired
1149 2018-04-02 21:14:44 I'm may be solidly mediocre at like 15 different things, but I keep wishing I was specifically good/extensively knowledgeable at, eg, crypto, embedded kernel reversing, trustzone minutiae and errata, differential power analysis, advanced DSP, or Clearpath mainframes.
1150 2018-04-02 21:14:43 I kind of just went there for no real reason this is more about asking whether there is more to life than crypto? All those brains and experience with crypto currency, isn’t something else that interests you/that you can do than day trade & commentate?

1155 2018-04-02 21:13:42 Zio= Crypto STATE auxiliary.
1156 2018-04-02 21:13:41 It's a fine strategy, I do something similar in some cases. Some guys are convinced tether will ruin crypto, but I'm more optimistic about it being a good option to keep your USD value safe but in crypto
1157 2018-04-02 21:13:33 Calling it now, @gincoin_crypto is THE masternode to hold in 2018.  This coin is a beauty.  @CMB_Uncle @CryptoScarface y'all need to relook at this

1183 2018-04-02 21:10:33 BTC will not reach an all time high this year in my opinion. See my tweets in Jan where I suggested a drop to 5k against the longer term trend line. I now think 5k is optimistic. ATH could be 2020 for me.

1197 2018-04-02 21:07:17 Jimmy is a full btc max and makes no bones about it. I’ll keep my btc but not put every other coin in the shitter, based of Satoshi and network effect.

1198 2018-04-02 21:06:45 @eastdakota I’m still hazy on the privacy angle of 1.1.1.1. One of the cases in the blog post is ISP snooping, but can’t such an MITM attacker just snoop IPs out of your later requests? When the mapping from URL to IP is public what does DNS crypto buy you?

1212 2018-04-02 21:04:01 Think we’ll really retrace that far from ATH? I’m not sure myself. If BTC reaches a new ATH this year, we may be in an entirely different stage of that cycle than we think...

I am no adviser on investments, but also, I am doing a big documentary on crypto AND blockchain and here is my opinion: when a market is volatile NEVER invest more than you are ready to lose.
1225 2018-04-02 21:02:08 FaceMask just went open beta! Crypto brought to you by @openpgpjs !
1226 2018-04-02 21:01:44 TBC is carving out it’s own path as the first “Abundance-Based” currency, and we are not bound to the path that crypto-currencies take.  Always remember that!  

We will always protect our TBC community!
1227 2018-04-02 21:01:44 Observation:
- April 17 USA Tax Day is 2 weeks away
- Around 12.31.17 crypto prices were highest - hence the amount of cap gains for 2017 are pretty large !
- Resulting in significant crypto selling pressure as IRS (unfortunately) does not yet accept crypto as payment

1230 2018-04-02 21:01:04 Collective, strategic, thoughtful messaging would be a refreshing change from the crypto kingpins.  A united front stands a better chance at making positive change than keeping your heads down in the goldfish bowls.
1231 2018-04-02 21:00:42 Can‘t believe how eerie I feel when I tell you that I am reasonably deep in the #bitcoin twitter community and you sound almost exactly like most of them.Replace FANG w/ HODL and SPY with $BTC. I think crypto is the global liquidity end game and both stocks it have ways to fall.
1232 2018-04-02 21:00:41 Everyone needs to just chill, accumulate more every payday (if you’re still working a regular job) and don’t  at your Delta till EOY.  This isn’t crashing for good, crypto isn’t dead.  Just keep buying and be thankful you’re investing in this market, not Wall St.
1233 2018-04-02 21:00:37 Basketball is a better analogy for crypto than football
1234 2018-04-02 21:00:30 Well the stock market is starting to look like the crypto market. 

On a bright note, now we can ask all our nocoiner friends, "How your stocks holding up? Looking a little like the crypto market these days!"
1235 2018-04-02 21:00:24 tbh I'm glad that the crypto market crashed, the speculation around what the crypto projects had potential to do was way overstated. Hopefully the crash brings sensationalists back down to earth. Hopefully the projects can get back to work instead of looking at prices everyday.

1246 2018-04-02 20:59:57 The level of market manipulation and corruption is extreme in crypto. The speculative market is driving adoption and that's the unsustainable paradigm. A pure speculative market tends toward a pure ponzi scheme paradigm of new feeding the old.
1247 2018-04-02 20:59:48 Opportunity cost scenario: Go to study for two more years to obtain my masters (acquire more debt) or work for two years and put all the earned capital in crypto? I know the mainstream answer, but come on, nothing is mainstream about crypto
1248 2018-04-02 20:59:44 Since I'm sure I'm not alone in looking to diversify (been crypto only except Robinhood), what exchange do you recommend is best for CanadianMJ and all around stock trading with low fees?
1249 2018-04-02 20:59:30 Personally, I like their white paper. I hope it will be the boom

1251 2018-04-02 20:58:48 My old self keeps telling me "alts are bottomed, buy some shit" but the new me keeps holding back and waiting for good uptrends and not these goofball bulltraps (other than short term swings).

Having a crypto personality disorder these days, ugh.
1252 2018-04-02 20:58:42 Be careful of $trac they have a masternode system that will wipe out your mn if you have to reboot for a security protocol. Not trying to spread FUD but that’s pretty fucked up. Can’t imagine losing thousands of dollars like that. More info on my page.

1287 2018-04-02 20:54:12 cnbc just had an article today about this claiming bitcoin will drop to 77 billion market value or a 1/3 of what it is at now. They just love to hate the corn, time to pamp it up and really piss em off!

1299 2018-04-02 20:52:47 $TFD will be shilled to the end of the earth. This is a hype driven, speculative market.

1303 2018-04-02 20:52:25 Agreed. Decentralization is the future, and quality decentralized networks like $GRS, $VTC, $DGB and $LTC all have a great future as part of the new crypto financial system along with the king $BTC.
1304 2018-04-02 20:52:24 Yeah, this year could really be a turning point for Crypto, but the war against change is strong and there is a big effort to limit the success of these instruments. I'm with you though, persistence will pay dividends. I'll have to check out $MUSIC this afternoon.

1311 2018-04-02 20:51:57 Some tips for new $crypto & #blockchain-based projects:

- Raise capital privately before ICO
- Have a working product (prototype)
- Pay a legal team to define project as #utility or #security (reduces liablity 1000fold)
- Sync ICO & listings with positive market sentiment

1364 2018-04-02 20:42:21 One of the biggest issues for any crypto is being able to freely convert it into the denomination of your choice. For most, this is fiat. For me, as a holder of #xrp, it is nigh on impossible for me to convert it to a usable form of currency in my country without huge fees.

1366 2018-04-02 20:42:09 The greatest fallacy of the crypto world:

1376 2018-04-02 20:40:52 No need to invest in anything fancy. If you're an accredited investor, just buy shares in one or more funds runs by @GrayscaleInvest. That way, even if crypto prices drop, say, 20% in a year, you still have a good chance of profiting the year holding period, from the OTC premium.

1381 2018-04-02 20:39:51 ...and then pay taxes in 2018 on what they sold to pay their 2017 taxes.  Not to bad on good times but you get rekt in bad times.  They need to tax crypto as currency for it to become accepted, but not thinking that will happen anytime soon.
1382 2018-04-02 20:39:49 Oh yeah for sure. They did a great job introducing those characters, which is most of what I’ve seen of them so far

1428 2018-04-02 20:31:08 I’d read an article earlier this year about how crypto-mines in China are setting up right at the hydro plants, with dormitories full of young men and women spending their days swapping out GPU cards and tending the farm. Bizarre.
1429 2018-04-02 20:30:54 Exactly.
1430 2018-04-02 20:30:47 No problem, I just wondered if it has a meaning besides crypto is rising, which I agree with 100%

1447 2018-04-02 20:28:50 Oh I'm being way to harsh and don't truly mean it. I've just been following the drama that is litecoin Twitter and it's honestly rediculous. There's a lot of people out there giving crypto a bad name right now; which is the opposite of what we want to see.
1448 2018-04-02 20:28:43 I've never seen such an agnry mob of crypto peeps before.  They make me think of a newborn infant that is suddenly trying to be the identical twin of their 13 year old brother and wondering why no one listens to their high pitched whaling.
1449 2018-04-02 20:28:41 @tenxwallet @julianhosp I love your company & team. But, I believe VISA/MC are holding down crypto debit cards. Will still need their approval even w/banking license.

1487 2018-04-02 20:23:35 Thats 1 country, one small group of people. People who are already invested most likely. You need a new base of investors.

1507 2018-04-02 20:21:05 Bitcoin is the solution for the failed banking system 2008. Most ppl in crypto forgot about. Why doesn’t bitcoin talk anymore about a P2P electronic cash system? Happily BCH does. Crypto markets should be primarily just about that.

1516 2018-04-02 20:20:39 Surprised. Guess matter of opinion.

On stocks:
. Tariffs => slightly lower equilibrium GDP
. Higher rates than expected => lower valuations
. Higher avg realized vol (from monetary tightening) => funds de-risk

On crypto:
. Investors decimated => demand greatly curtailed
1517 2018-04-02 20:20:38 all the candidates have even more impressive history with computation/crypto/etc. People just initially beieved because he was a good candidate. Nothing more than that. 

And he was EXTREMELY arrogant with journalists while asked to present proofs. Very suspicious.

1613 2018-04-02 20:09:44 First, you said “fraud is only possible in a credit based system”, contrasting that with Bitcoin.  So nice job moving those goalposts.  Second, electronic-transaction fraud is *reversible* outside the crypto world, through the legal system, even if I don’t know who you are.

1619 2018-04-02 20:09:00 Was thinking the same thing... pulling divergence on the daily time frame... the real question is can it continue.  I think an overall market bounce would be better for crypto like the last time we were at 6k.  Don't want to think of the consequences of an overall market crash
1620 2018-04-02 20:08:58 Still trying to figure out, first I have seen crypto up while regular stocks are down.

They will launch a decentralised anonymous crypto agnostic atomic swap ready peer to peer marketplace with MAD trustless escrow transactions.

1698 2018-04-02 19:59:40 RT JesseDamiani: Money threads everything we do, and that will be just as true in VR. We have over a decade of evidence from SecondLife that native currencies work—and with the recent explosion of #crypto, there’s no doubt in my mind this will factor into future metaverses.
1699 2018-04-02 19:59:37 "Permanent" storage is an untapped market - cloud services are all extremely young in any real terms, and there is no guarantee of their security in keeping assets safe in the very long term.

the increase in RAM prices is totally unrelated to cryptomining
so is the increase in price for for high end power supplies

1737 2018-04-02 19:55:28 It would be more beneficial to use the most simplistic method of whichever indicator type you are applying (volume, momentum, etc) in combination with other types to narrow out false data. Instead of measuring volume two different ways, measure two different components.

1776 2018-04-02 19:51:07 15: How are you integrating your friends and neighbors into the revolution? Does anyone care about bringing down the plantation? Should we just be focusing on WhenLambo? WhenMoon? What's a Crypto Trader to do in these choppy waters?

Let's solve this together, friends.
1777 2018-04-02 19:51:00 @AltOne_Crypto @tradingroomapp @chrisL23406329 @BigChonis @BigCheds The pattern looks very similar to the Feb. 6 at a smaller scale, doesn't it?
1778 2018-04-02 19:50:14 Definitely from a fundamental standpoint $NANO solves a lot of the waste. It truly is the "green" crypto. Also I agree devs could market a little better but tbh if any crypto is gonna take off its gonna be because of its fundamentals, not some roger ver shill. $NANO is the future

1783 2018-04-02 19:49:59 Really?? You went from 19K to 14K and think it is a gain?  No wonder twitter is so full of nonsence. IT is not strange people are losing their confidence in BTC and all crypto related items.
1784 2018-04-02 19:49:42 Thank the universe for crypto
1785 2018-04-02 19:49:37 CC aren't stocks. They act like them in terms of how they fluctuate in price and the sheer number of altcoins creates a market for them but the idea is to narrow down to only having a few CCs and eventually to using one single CC for everyday use.
1786 2018-04-02 19:49:30 It depends on your goals. I see it as a gain all around.

BTCs consistently gained in FIAT value since inception. Good bet there.
BTC is what all crypto is valued in.  That's a better position to buy alts from. Good there too.
1787 2018-04-02 19:49:26 $LTC dominance increasing up with bitcoin where other coins decreasing with respect to dominance ...good sign @SatoshiLite @satoshi_guru for Litecoin to be 2nd crypto in my opinion after bitcoin

1789 2018-04-02 19:49:08 I also scrapped up a fire ass crypto rap while traveling this week. Gonna try to produce it in my free time and get it out there this month. It’s about time we see some actual talent in the crypto-hip-hop game.
1790 2018-04-02 19:49:03 Always remember it was reported that the founder of BITCOIN sold out in Dec2017 for a reason. He saw the veil of BS was be uncovered so he took his MONEY  not crypto and ran
1791 2018-04-02 19:49:00 Never too late crypto are bleeding now time to get in
1792 2018-04-02 19:48:52 thank you for your crypto-support.

1797 2018-04-02 19:48:00 2/ Crypto is an entirely new asset class - as this value emerges, we think you’ll see the crypto space having more and more of an impact on traditional markets, in a similar way that technology companies contribute significantly to the movements of traditional markets.

1803 2018-04-02 19:46:57 When this dip will get over and when bull run will start ?
1804 2018-04-02 19:46:55 1/ More speculative than empirical. Historically, & most recently in February, we have seen that when the DOW takes a drop, it seems to kickstart the crypto markets. Many investors/traders view crypto as a hedge against traditional markets.
1805 2018-04-02 19:46:51 Is this financial advice?
1806 2018-04-02 19:46:49 Absolutely which is why bringing up fraud as a critique of crypto in the first place is intellectually dishonest at best

1812 2018-04-02 19:45:49 Do not get suckered into Bitcoin or other crypto as now their new spin is crypto over equities since they can’t fight the currency. Invest in BlockChain and it’s ledger system as that what the whole digital cash world is about not BS monopoly coins. Con men just keep spinning BS

1828 2018-04-02 19:44:02 $NANO's December run was also MUCH larger than $BTC or any other crypto for that matter. We are fine. It's only been 3 months since people have really even found out about it.
1829 2018-04-02 19:43:54 Thanks for answering. That's it. Trx do have CEO. No argue. It clearly says that this token does have CEO. This is a business not a crypto and you also need to do research that there is no CEO in terms of Crypto. In that means the majority of tokens are in CEO
1830 2018-04-02 19:43:51 We exchanging everything on fiats and vice-versa when we trading stocks etc., it's called pairs. We are not using stocks as legal tenders, right? And there is a reason for that. Crypto has 0 advantage over stocks or fiats. Same thing but more volatile, which is great for traders
1831 2018-04-02 19:43:18 thanks.
1832 2018-04-02 19:43:13 Is one of the most awaited project in crypto world. #WPCICO #WPC #blockchain.

1836 2018-04-02 19:42:21 Haha wow the negative narrative is aweful and crypto Twitter
1837 2018-04-02 19:42:08 I dont think fundamentals in equity and crypto markets have changed... lots of reasons to believe liquidity and tax related selling are driving selling pressure... and of course, headlines from Washington (bark vs bite)
1838 2018-04-02 19:42:06 As much as Crypto has "sold off" there's still 91 coins with >$100mm mkt cap including such fan favorites as  Byteball Bytes, Golem, and Dragonchain
1839 2018-04-02 19:42:05 Still pissed I wasn’t into crypto a few months before the new year. $DRGN group came into my work and I served their private event. Should have looked further into it and gotten into the ICO.

1842 2018-04-02 19:41:45 I'm not interested in their activity. I want to see results. As for now, the results are missing. I see that crypto space has only whitepapers and testnets. Bitcoin being in the same spot.
1843 2018-04-02 19:41:39 Are they actually hedged or are they just crypto funds?
1844 2018-04-02 19:41:22 Great to hear whitelist has been a huge success, looking forward to get white listed and participating in tonken sale. Fingers crossed waiting for the result to be out.

1845 2018-04-02 19:40:55 The more places start accepting it, the more I'll spend it. Hate using credit cards for purchases online or off. Crypto is just a safer way to transact.
1846 2018-04-02 19:40:50 Looks like a business trying to get the “blockchain bump”. Highly dought they’ll make any real moves. White paper is a huge uphill battle. Shady responses to the listing fiasco. And their social media platforms look like its run by a 15 year old girl. Better risk/reward elsewhere

1855 2018-04-02 19:39:55 Thing is, he is right. $BTC is and will always be the backbone as the most secure chain and SOV. But quality decentralized networks like $LTC, $DGB, $VTC, $GRS can help improve and extend decentralization as the new crypto financial system comes online.
1856 2018-04-02 19:39:34 Hmm. Care to elaborate what exactly you think will happen in may?

1859 2018-04-02 19:39:24 But the point is, who was controlling/suppressing it when it dipped 90%, 80% and rallied. Why can't it just be a conformity of market cycle/historic pattern if this time it dips to 90%. Fractals are similar too. This is just one simple point there are more deeper criticisms.

1883 2018-04-02 19:36:04 It is possible to build up a significant stake in crypto currency by buying the private keys from someone and avoiding changes to the ledger (blockchain). Is this an issue? @DouglasCarswell @DominicFrisby
1884 2018-04-02 19:36:01 And I will be doing the exact same thing if @Chase does this foolishness. Matter fact, I'm definitely leaving if they keep charging me to buy crypto.

1897 2018-04-02 19:34:55 Trading Tip:
If a coin you hold pumps a lot, consider following price with a trailing stop loss to confirm profits should price go down, especially in this bear market. The standard is 10% below price but can be tighter depending on your risk profile & risk tolerance $crypto

1902 2018-04-02 19:34:28 $BTC There is a very compelling argument we are going to double bottom at $5,800 using Elliott Wave Theory. That, coupled with trend-lines and chart patterns, its making a great case. I'm hoping to see some action between now and tomorrow night.

1929 2018-04-02 19:30:48 The business model of Facebook and Google is, that the personal information of the users is property of the platform. Framing it that way gives them the right to monetise this data as they see fit. Until now, people accept this.

1931 2018-04-02 19:30:41 To me I think it’s more that they did marketing around the game as them consulting about cults and the real-life ways they wrap people in, aka not brainwashing but using peer pressure, etc. But then the game is all about brainwashing...

1936 2018-04-02 19:29:28 so you post an insulting/disdainful comment and then think because you retweeted the post it makes it acceptable....

1947 2018-04-02 19:27:20 No doubt. Need multiple fights otherwise it could be 1 minute then all over. Unless of course they were a similar size and actually trained properly which I doubt will happen what with all the crypto trading.

1955 2018-04-02 19:25:55 IMHO:
1- Adam and Eve double bottom? Good! But in that case there's no hurry to buy.
2- Not reached the bottom yet? Good! So in that case there's no hurry to buy.
And with "no hurry" I mean 1-2 weeks to clear the situation and in the meantime starting the accumulation.
1956 2018-04-02 19:25:46 I like it. DCA. We have lots of cash. Like crypto. Just buy a little at a time. When it feels real bad like today.
1957 2018-04-02 19:25:26 I'ma ask you this, what if a big crisis comes into crypto world?  How do you think trx can survive?

'3k soon guys. Crypto is dead.'
1983 2018-04-02 19:20:43 Its a way for new companies to get the word out about their new crypto. You have to share their links sometimes and then they deposit tokens in your wallet. This one is worth $10 I think. Ive made a got amount of $$$...Bitcoin did one years ago and look how that turned out
1984 2018-04-02 19:20:10 Ok bear with me here as I'm thinking way down the road but in an ever advancing digital world globalization is inevitable.

1989 2018-04-02 19:19:02 I think it depends on adoption for a large part. Once people use crypto it'll be pretty obvious that BCH offers the best experience. The only reason why people believe in BTC is because they never try to buy anything with it.

2061 2018-04-02 19:09:29 It's an argument that the underlying ideas can be used for public verification purposes- which they already are, under less fancy names than "block chain". It's also an argument that any fantasy of a currency based on the principles of crypto mined "coin" is fraudulent nonsense.
2062 2018-04-02 19:09:21 EDO already 50m mcap

50x bit far fetched innit?

10x is cool for me
2063 2018-04-02 19:09:16 Its forbidden in France. What do I do sir ? Keep my boring job and accumulate crypto every month till I can shit on my boss desk ?
2064 2018-04-02 19:09:16 Good way to look at things, indeed this is still the infancy of Crypto. Wait until 50% or more of the population is aware of the market in a few years! you think you've seen gains up to this point? Guess again! Buy low and get rich fam. My 5yr plan 
2065 2018-04-02 19:08:55 You must not have saw that I retweeted.... DYOR before you pop off.
2066 2018-04-02 19:08:54 i believe that usage is definiatly an indicator of value in crypto assets. In Steem's case, they are doing majority microtransactions: small payments for content/incentives. The decentralized model of content creation/sharing will one day be the standard.

2077 2018-04-02 19:08:12 I completely agree. And there are more ppl similar to him around here.
2078 2018-04-02 19:08:10 People are saying this is the accumulation period and the stock market dropping is proof

Yes, stocks will continue to sell off as money moves into crypto but...

Stocks have a lot more to drop this month, and until they do, I'm not worried that this is the bottom for $BTC
2079 2018-04-02 19:07:43 Keep doing what ya doing. Scammers are bad for crypto. If a newbie gets scammed they never return to crypto.

2090 2018-04-02 19:06:29 Mostly it is novel crypto combined with fairly hardcore systems engineering.  The technology stack is domain-neutral, so many different application opportunities are presenting themselves to us.  Feel free to reach out.
2091 2018-04-02 19:06:28 So sad to see stuff like that.

People think that if they donate money(if they actually do) makes them good.

Unless you have love and respect for others, money doesn't matter, no matter how much you donate.

2095 2018-04-02 19:06:18 Does it? So I'll assume you've been looking at those addresses and you have proof the trustee is still selling? because you sound very certain. Or is this just a presumption on your part? Sounds like the latter to me  :)
2096 2018-04-02 19:06:18 Don't have to be an expert trader or have a degree in economics to see the signs. Crypto is the future, and the proof is banks are interested in it.
2097 2018-04-02 19:06:03 So, are you saying you like $HVN?

2099 2018-04-02 19:05:49 I believe there's more incentive to manipulate it now since it's becoming more mainstream and there is more volume/money involved.
2100 2018-04-02 19:05:45 Bittrex coins mostly get a crazy pump like that.. haven't seen that lately with binance..

2105 2018-04-02 19:05:04 The crash started the day of cme futures, but I do believe all the bans have been the biggest single downward pressure incident. People think its expensive to manipulate markets, not when all you need are bad headlines. Of course the timing didn't help.

2107 2018-04-02 19:04:57 Well, we need to define what "blood on the street" means. For me it means "dip zone" and we are not there yet. But we are in the accumulation zone and I can smell the blood coming. However I'm bullish for the next days: we need climb before the fall.
2108 2018-04-02 19:04:53 Great advice.
2109 2018-04-02 19:04:52 Bitcoin and Ethereum will likely rally in the third quarter of this year. Whats the likelihood that the crypto markets hit highs and then sink back down to 20k this time next year?

2124 2018-04-02 19:03:27 Good read, my first question would be, bitcoin has seen retracements of upto 90% and risen back, there was no 'cartel' back then then so why is the cause the 'cartel' now?

2189 2018-04-02 18:56:59 Agreed. I think Skycoin is another solid play with their big conference coming up. It has even hone up in the past 2 weeks and held its value
2190 2018-04-02 18:56:57 You seriously make no sense at all. Get out of crypto, you contribute zero to the overall goal.
2191 2018-04-02 18:56:48 Fun ratio!: The amount of Bitcoin/Crypto podcasts and YouTube shows that started in December and January no longer producing shows.

2194 2018-04-02 18:56:37 I've spent the better part of 12 months dragging XVG out of the mud here on Twitter. from FUD, missed deadlines to quirks, bugs and fixes. I've never felt more confident and optimistic about the future of @vergecurrency than I do at this very moment.

Honestly not trying to pump.
2195 2018-04-02 18:56:36 The guy has been on crypto twitter for exactly 1 year. Since when did this make you an OG?
2196 2018-04-02 18:56:32 This is a huge project with the best team . Hope long journey in the crypto world
2197 2018-04-02 18:56:24 closed $XLM position, got in 3/29 @ 2650 sats, unloaded at 3212 sats

2199 2018-04-02 18:56:13 Bitcoin are soon history. Trust me. Iwe seen this before. You see. The new era in the world of cryptocurrency will soon emerge. We will call it the crypto-night era. OneCoin will destroy Bitcoin like Superman
2200 2018-04-02 18:56:12 Adam! I somehow followed you through crypto but do you make YouTube for music production? could have sword I've watched some of your vids before.
2201 2018-04-02 18:56:07 We need new blood
2202 2018-04-02 18:56:02 Also, I’m very early into the story but I think the criticisms about not delivering on its possible heavy handedness on the religious right is a bit of an assumption. To me it just feels like the devs read the David Koresh wiki page and made a game.
2203 2018-04-02 18:56:02 Sshhh... it's 3AM in Perth.  Go to sleep.
2204 2018-04-02 18:55:51 why you always hate on $crypto? 
2205 2018-04-02 18:55:29 Umm hi Josh
2206 2018-04-02 18:55:26 It seems the level with which a person is invested in hating crypto, is a function of when they first hated on crypto.
2207 2018-04-02 18:55:23 Wait! You didn’t mention Soros or Crypto-Jews! Or is that in “Killing Bill O’Reilly”??
2208 2018-04-02 18:55:21 Cannabis may be the catalyst that sparks a crypto boom. Dispensaries having a hard time storing cash.
2209 2018-04-02 18:55:13 lmao you are so passive aggressive its unbelievable 

how do you beg someone for a shout out and then turn around and say something like that. i hope thats not how you build all your relationships. good lord..smdh.

i had faith in u doing big things but now thats down the drain

2220 2018-04-02 18:53:55 I got *REALLY* into FC3. The only open world game I ever 100%-ed. The story was eh but I just loved the fact that I was free to wander and explore at my pace.

2222 2018-04-02 18:53:38 My understanding is that this partnership (#XVG) does not just involve a crypto and a big CORP, but one that involves these two and day to day consumers. #XLM -> IBM and #XRP -> #BBVA partnerships, don't involve consumers, but, XVG one does!

2226 2018-04-02 18:53:23 in 2011, I worked for a rideshare company. Before Uberx, Lyft and Didi.

We were banned, impounded, arrested and shamed by gov & regulators. Now, it's hard to imagine a world without Lyft or Uber. 

Crypto is no different. These are important early days. 

Thank you @SunilPaul

2234 2018-04-02 18:52:18 I hope you never realize the crypto sphere is as anti SJW as you can get and thus this is terrible marketing :)
2235 2018-04-02 18:52:16 Burning Man sounds nice.  Her take on crypto bro conferences was sharp and rang true.
2236 2018-04-02 18:52:14 The most important thing is the weight classes.  You never want anyone boxing anyone else with more then a 30lb difference.
2237 2018-04-02 18:51:56 Plus, in a proper market, Cardano would be seriously investigated for the aggressive fundraising techniques used during their ICO in Japan. Charles reply that he wasn't aware of what all the people affiliated with them were doing doesn't excuse them for the responsibility
2238 2018-04-02 18:51:45 @into_crypto Thank for the follow
2239 2018-04-02 18:51:37 No chance.  Crypto only works when new money enters the market.  It’s roulette
2240 2018-04-02 18:51:32 This project should undoubtedly interest both investors and ordinary consumers. Thoughtful and clear ideas make it really attractive. I recommend to everyone Develop[crypto]  #devcryptio #ICO
2241 2018-04-02 18:51:28 How the hell do u run a crypto show! Sometimes simplest and accurate explanation are not it. Btc has been in bear market since past few months. Nothing has changed. Real impact is not caused banning ads but by btc failing to rise 1k$ per day

2245 2018-04-02 18:51:06 My advice to all #crypto fans and those addicted to it, don’t buy any tokens they will not rise as they promise in their fake news and rumors #xrp #ripple #btc unless you are ready to lose all your money . Be careful for scammers with their lies to cheat investors @Ripple
2246 2018-04-02 18:51:03 I have been investing in Kin for sometime....

The communication from the team is the main reason why I invested in the first place. 
I have never been more confident in the world of crypto, then I have with this team... @ted_livingston is a visionary! 
2247 2018-04-02 18:50:54 Gotta update my Twitter app apparently lol
2248 2018-04-02 18:50:53 The fact you think media is ruined shows how crazily better media is than it used to be.

2250 2018-04-02 18:50:47 i lost money in futures in college- albeit i was running some econometric models etc etc vs blindly trusting crypto kitties as solid investment advice

2252 2018-04-02 18:50:30 Yeah I’m pretty sure it’s gonna get tiring real quick. For the first hour or so I was just enjoying existing in the peacefulness of that first island’s forest. Not so much a thing once you leave that spot.
2253 2018-04-02 18:50:30 Coinbase handing over customer data to the IRS demonstrates the perils of using legally registered crypto businesses subject to gov't seizure.

I was a Coinbase customer that probably had my information seized.

Good thing I was conservative & disclosed my trades on my taxes.

2257 2018-04-02 18:49:35 We are in the beginning of the accumulation zone, but I don't see the blood on the streets yet. Starting the accumulation today could be a smart move; going all in now could be not. This is my opinion, but I know less than Jon Snow.

2286 2018-04-02 18:45:28 My biggest complaint is it’s hard to just sit still in the game because of that. I super enjoy the experience in general it provides but as soon as you stop driving/flying/scooting around the game just throws beardy bois/gals at you nonstop

2296 2018-04-02 18:44:33 At least it’s continuing to grow. I bought when it was a little higher. I believe it will come back with much more though

2298 2018-04-02 18:44:32 Success in predicting crypto. Seems to be so Relative. Like Baseball. Fail 7 out of 10 times. And you are considered successful.

2305 2018-04-02 18:43:41 Dont wanna come off rude but its china dude are you that shocked? You think the dictator of China is gonna implement crypto into his economy sp he has no idea whats going on? They only way it works over in china is if they have 100% control
2306 2018-04-02 18:43:41 it will be interesting if stock market declines and crypto rises...the asymmetrical relationship would create a buying panic.
2307 2018-04-02 18:43:17 The development of $crypto will do to finance and trust what the internet did to information and media.
2308 2018-04-02 18:43:17 Theresa May is trying to create a false reality that it is the UK together with EU(and even within EU ongoing has she stated the recent speech.)

2309 2018-04-02 18:43:15 Anxious for the #crypto market cap to reach a couple of $trillion. The failing traditional stock markets will make it happen. On a side note, i must make a confession: I'm an addict.... to #Litecoin

2323 2018-04-02 18:40:56 Signing a treaty with Visa or Mastercard is doing the exact opposite of why crypto was created. People and companies need to understand. Get transformed to crypto or die a slow death.

2335 2018-04-02 18:39:19 The day Trump took office the stock market went up 300-400 pts at the time it was 17k for the Dow. It is now 23k up ~6k since he took office. Corrections are healthy and a part of investing. The dems would have heightened regulation and taxes depressing the market...

2341 2018-04-02 18:39:01 Bingo! For a currencies to have value it has to have some kind of purchasing power! So it boils down to who is willing to accept a given currency in trade for goods and or a service. Bitcoin and other crypto currency's are starting to be more widely accepted in all of the above.

2345 2018-04-02 18:38:32 THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVICE: pay your taxes. You are sacrificing long term pain for short term gain. To put this in crypto perspective. It is like putting half your portfolio into $TRX for the rest of your life. If your comortable with that good luck!
2346 2018-04-02 18:38:29 #bitcoin at 20k: it is too expensive

2380 2018-04-02 18:36:24 you have 2 weeks to load up on @vergecurrency before $XVG value is no longer measured in satoshis and cents, but rather, Verges and Dollars

A.) Mass adoption means high demand, supply and demand will affect value
B.) Being able to use Verge as Verge alleviates the need for FIAT

2384 2018-04-02 18:36:17 To overtake Ethereum by market cap (as it is now) XRP needs to reach $3 and TRX $1.8 To overtake Bitcoin by market cap XRP needs to reach $9 and TRX $5.4 (approximately). Both have ambition for the top spot. Make calculations of how many of these you need to have accordingly.

2392 2018-04-02 18:35:46 Well that's because it's still un-used as currency. Once devs get partnerships with businesses and build a working product then we will see the tech flourishing. The internet changed how we communicate, crypto will change how we do business. It's the only logical step forward.
2393 2018-04-02 18:35:43 When I gave 10,000 $XVG away for Christmas when it was worth .25 cents a coin it felt amazing. Seeing how active and excited the #Verge community got. Favorite this tweet if you think I should do another #Crypto giveaway. Maybe $TRX or $XRP

Straight,  fair and completely doable.

Will you challenge them ?

2456 2018-04-02 18:28:41 @MikeOkuda Mike, be wary of this guy Jimmy Dore. He's some sort of crypto-Trumpist, I think. He denies the Russia story and so on. Beware of Romulans bearing gifts. ;)
2457 2018-04-02 18:28:33 Cheds.... i think you'll run out of time to actually make money if you focus on scammers. Stick to your charts --> you're good at it, it provides a service most people suck at, and there are already plenty of crypto twitter types exposing frauds.

2463 2018-04-02 18:28:00 Yes it crashed because first Ripple is a crappy coin and people realized that. I mean they are basically against everything that crypto is about and second, these Japanese banks just showed some interest in xrp and not like they changed their entire business model based on xrp.
2464 2018-04-02 18:27:52 The point you've overlooked, is that bitcoin does not solve today's "money" problems. It's a good start, but at worldwide scale, it has many issues to tackle before it becomes the only viable crypto.

2787 2018-04-02 18:01:04 The problem is that the new system isn’t even ready yet, we still have years to go imo. If everyone were to suddenly switch to crypto/smart contracts the system would have no chance of handling the load. But I agree the next crisis will lead many important people into the space.

There seems to be a Rhovit #airdrop going around. They have no whitepaper, team, or a finished website. This will not be shared here as it cannot be verified that it is legitimate.
Please be careful who you are getting #Airdrops from
 #ICO #crypto #bounty #cryptocurrency
2873 2018-04-02 17:53:34 Crypto markets are decidedly in the green today, with BTC over the $7,000 price point and ETH close to $400 #News
2874 2018-04-02 17:53:22 The two will coincide. The new generation of crypto rich will need something to do to stop them getting up to no good.
2875 2018-04-02 17:53:13 Everyone is being quiet so the bears stay away mate.

2877 2018-04-02 17:53:12 We are all patiently waiting for another shower stream bro 
2878 2018-04-02 17:53:02 Started one year ago in the Crypto Kingdom. Grinding away everyday in this dip. Now I have 1 whole LTC (weekly buys and trades). Next goal one ETH, and hopefully one day one full BTC. I’m totally hooked!
2879 2018-04-02 17:53:00 Do a stream, that'll get it going. :)
2880 2018-04-02 17:52:51 I have you in my TOP 5 to win The Masters!

2883 2018-04-02 17:52:41 Sorry mate, didnt see it. I'd do it for charity! I would probably lose though, I've never boxed before.
2884 2018-04-02 17:52:41 No sir

2887 2018-04-02 17:52:25 Good! Hope it stays there until my bank completes its system-wide conversion and I can access my acct again to make transfers into my crypto exchange acct. Been shut out the whole time BTC was falling.

2891 2018-04-02 17:52:01 I thought my twitter feed had frozen but it’s really that quite out there
2892 2018-04-02 17:51:49 I can't log in to my account on the site Walletours. It  was 11,000 WTS and it got only 3,500 WTS.

2893 2018-04-02 17:51:45 As a noob I see 2 types of Twitter crypto celebs.Their type stay shilling having people buying at all time highs talkin bout $1400 by April lol. Then you got real non biased pros like you who save me thousands by tweets like "Shields Up". Stay strong buddy,FDB!
2894 2018-04-02 17:51:43 Except for all the people that bought in well above the current mark. The flows were not heavy at the smaller levels.
2895 2018-04-02 17:51:30 You mean the same shadowy groups that forced you to pay out nearly $50 million in sexual harassment lawsuits?

We call that progress, you blubbering crypto-fascist.
2896 2018-04-02 17:51:26 Didn’t think so 
2897 2018-04-02 17:51:18 Everything? So you take responsibility for MY losses in the market too? Thanks, man. Here I was thinking I was to blame. Would you like to pay me back in crypto or fiat?
2898 2018-04-02 17:51:18 For a person whose got crypto everywhere in his bio..you couldn't tell that that was CMC?
2899 2018-04-02 17:51:03 lmaooooooooo
2900 2018-04-02 17:51:03 Hmm Cartel Crypto? What's next, the Jenny Craig coin with a pix of Marie Osmond? Careful with that one! One could Lose 50% in the first week!
2901 2018-04-02 17:50:57 Like this company, they make me feel confident and great success. 
I recommend everyone to participate in ICO. #Elementh #CrowdSale #ICO #crypto
2902 2018-04-02 17:50:53 Qasier for a trader like me. The special feature like trading cryptocurrency by using fiat currency will surely attract a lot of interesting people in crypto world! #BitEsprit #ICO #BitEspritICO Alcuin against foreign exchange currencies.
2903 2018-04-02 17:50:51 I'm not talking about scam ads - I'm just moreso commenting on crypto exposure in general.
2904 2018-04-02 17:50:22 How is your search for a new service? Check out @goodbitsio, we already have a number of crypto newsletters and will be continue powering them.
2905 2018-04-02 17:50:21 It wouldn't matter today in terms of moving the needle on the crypto markets because there's no eyeballs on the dex ad platforms yet.

The nocoiners use Facebook and Google and Instagram.
2906 2018-04-02 17:50:03 selling should end a few days before that as it takes time to convert crypto back into fiat. but buying may take longer if people are tapped out...
2907 2018-04-02 17:50:01 There are thousands of top wallet #hodl ers who just won't sell.

2914 2018-04-02 17:49:09 I think a hell of a lot of wall street $$$ will pour into crypto this year. As soon as the bull run/alt season starts and proves that crypto is here to stay- it will be impossible for them to resist with (like you say) the stock markets inevitable crash looming.

I understand that some may need morale and support during tough times but I think we should also be careful of "group think" and try to establish some cognitive dissonance for self reflection and growth.

3118 2018-04-02 17:24:54 One of the largest fundamental reasons why cryptocurrencies are selling off so hard is the major ad companies banning crypto ads.

Ad retargetting is like a mind worm, and without #Bitcoin ads following new users around the internet, demand will continue to be suppressed.
3119 2018-04-02 17:24:49 IMO this is not solely led by $AMZN. Semis are extremely weak, my guess from $TSLA confirming auto-pilot issues re: $NVDA suspending self-driving. Many semis were heavily bid on hopes of self-driving & crypto.. Lets not forget the leaked $FB memo also weighing on social media

Would you expect `BITBOX.Crypto.randomBytes(32)` to return <Buffer 5c91dd538880cd04f321eabc961f7c0fb209013e208b047260e5d08d5e3617e4> or '5c91dd538880cd04f321eabc961f7c0fb209013e208b047260e5d08d5e3617e4' ?
3134 2018-04-02 17:22:24 I think that some exchange has been running a crypto composite for some time - allowing a spread invest in the overall market. Hopefully its not bitfinex!

3136 2018-04-02 17:22:17 Crypto is supposed to be fun
3137 2018-04-02 17:21:41 Yay.
3138 2018-04-02 17:21:30 I’m giving crypto as an example of decentralized systems.
3139 2018-04-02 17:21:23 This is the project of the future. Excellent service with convenient interface and extensive functionality, which has great prospects. I advise everyone to become a part of it!

3140 2018-04-02 17:21:23 Countries that resist #crypto, and place harsh restrictions and bans, will watch their economies shrink as the money flows to countries which keep open #markets.

The #FUD will be huge, but not as big as the #FOMO, when $XVG and $BTC keep mooing higher anyway!

Just watch.

No: Crypto has value even if in another way than gold/diamonds.

3248 2018-04-02 17:10:53 It is impossible for anyone to successfully file taxes around crypto today.

- Lack of IRS guidance
- Too many edge cases are new
- Competing opinions from experts
- Lots of good faith & poor decisions

This will eventually be resolved. Until then, expect mass chaos and concern.

3268 2018-04-02 17:09:12 At this point #Telegram ICO has raised $1.7 Billion! Apparently the initial $850 million in crowd sale was not enough to make them happy? A lot of opinions out there on this project. What do you guys think? #ICO #crypto
3269 2018-04-02 17:09:11 I agree, buying MDMA online is actually a great use case, so crypto will stick around.

3271 2018-04-02 17:09:05 eating well != eating healthy. if you enjoy eating food that means you are selfish enough to force yourself into being ignorant of actual reality (in which kids are starving and dying of hunger). technology (cars,phones) can be used to do good(help those in need) or take selfies

3284 2018-04-02 17:08:07 this site looks like crap, anyone whos making 5 year estimates in a market like $crypto is pulling random numbers out of his ass, i can tell you tough $ocn with 20ml cap is underrated, dont make a science out of it, specially when ure not an expert
3285 2018-04-02 17:08:05 Right, I need to read up more on this, does the movement of ERC20 tokens on the network contribute to the ETH blockchain in the same way as ethereum, or does Ethereum itself have to be transacted to move it along? Basically ETH has to succeed at volume to keep the ERC flowing

3292 2018-04-02 17:06:57 No I haven't, with the current crypto climate I'm waiting for a change in the overall market direction from bearish to bullish. Happy to sit on my hands for now
3293 2018-04-02 17:06:54 Aren't there already blockchain dentists?  People need to stop giving any money to these scammy ICOs.  Crypto projects shouldnt need 10x the startup capital of a regular project.
3294 2018-04-02 17:06:49 I feel sorry for the lack of education that entity has.

3298 2018-04-02 17:06:19 I saw some things about it. It involved Litecoin Dad right? I guess crypto high is dying so drama builds to keep things interesting. It’s why I don’t don FB anymore.
3299 2018-04-02 17:06:03 Lets all stop eating well and stop living in nice homes/apts.  Lets stop driving cars.  Throw away your xbox and ps4's.  Throw away your cell phones. smh
3300 2018-04-02 17:06:00 @NicTrades correct me if I am wrong but aren’t all coins bought through an exchange like GDAX lumped together?
3301 2018-04-02 17:05:44 1. lol
2. his actions are reflection of how selfish he is. posting food pics and having ferrari pic as cover is enough to know he is < 100 IQ worm.

Your DNA should reproduce ~ 15 more times  to get over > 100 IQ and then come back with better virtue signaling. k thnx
3302 2018-04-02 17:05:40 Some confusion, yes. Impossible, no. 1. Crypto trading is taxed as capital gain (IRS 2014-21) 2. Mining taxed as ordinary income 3. Like-kind exchanges explicitly permitted pre-2018 (IRS Pub. 544) - get a CPA who is also a cryptotrader (hint: that’s us). We can do this together.

3317 2018-04-02 17:03:57 Governments will have to bend at the knee. They can't ban crypto globally without global governance. They can no longer control the currency or the narrative. They can't centralize power and information anymore.

3340 2018-04-02 17:02:09 Comme je l'ai dit en début de thread ("amha") il s'agit de mon avis personnel. Je pense que le cours du Bitcoin va chuter, et entrainer la chute des autres crypto-monnaies et du business de la Blockchain avec lui ; et je recommande donc silplement à tous mesure et prudence.

3356 2018-04-02 17:00:18 Where ppl get those feelings and have those trading experiences differ in many ways. Twitter and other social media platforms just persuade every Trader to go in the same direction. That’s why you have so many “traders” trying to sell their methods on here.

3396 2018-04-02 16:56:51 Isn't that kind of the point of crypto/decentralization, though? Wouldn't the community just move to another coin?

3398 2018-04-02 16:56:43 Telling someone where a bounce zone is isn’t telling someone to buy? I’m not saying it’s bad and he seems like a good guy but it’s a shame he’s in bed with @PhilakoneCrypto and Eric Choe who are known scammers. Ched blocks people who take issue with that. Very childish

3402 2018-04-02 16:56:05 They need to realize that crypto does not fit into previously established categories. Dollar in dollar out is the only suitable option. They categorized crypto in order grasp control and get maximum $$ asap. Different cryptos ars different things. Crypto trades are not $ gains...

3491 2018-04-02 16:44:14 Startups if you're accredited. Bitcoin is a terrible investment IMO. Crypto with technological applications (that are beyond just a plain currency). Rental properties or crowdfunded ones if you want it more passive.
3492 2018-04-02 16:44:11 What if 2018 is the collapse of the USD?  

TBC is the answer for the average person, regardless of what happens to the USD!  

TBC is based on an agreement to buy and sell a crypto-currency that ONLY GOES UP IN PRICE!

3536 2018-04-02 16:39:33 @cryptoblood_ Hi CB. I get that the drop in BTC price affects the yield for miners. What I'm wondering is will this create a downward spiral for BTC price? Do you think that the cat's that are paying crypto taxes are selling/culling portfolios to raise tax funds?

3552 2018-04-02 16:37:23 it's global in that everyone across the globe who's in crypto is in crypto. It's not global in that it hasn't achieved mass adoption by people who haven't even heard about crypto. Verge will be the one to take crypto to mass adoption, yes.

We'll discuss retardation in 2 weeks.
3553 2018-04-02 16:37:15 I do agree, that would be a smart/high risk investment. However a lot of accumulated debt is not always for this reason, still like TVs, cars, and boats which all lose 50% of value once they are used.

3583 2018-04-02 16:34:23 It is impossible for anyone to successfully file taxes around crypto today.

- Lack of IRS guidance
- Too many edge cases are new
- Competing opinions from experts
- Lots of good faith & poor decisions

This will eventually be resolved. Until then, expect mass chaos and concern.

3668 2018-04-02 16:27:12 3 weeks in a mad bull run on the streets of crypto.
3669 2018-04-02 16:27:06 Generally, when #crypto bull markets start #BTC pumps and alts get dumped in favor of $BTC.   Once the momentum slows in BTC, then traders rotate to alts.  What will happen next time?

3683 2018-04-02 16:26:15 My hypothesis is that this is the reason why the crypto market and stock market is acting up. Anyways, it is a matter of time as these will go up in anticipation of the earnings season in a few weeks.

3747 2018-04-02 16:18:03 so crypto isnt on a global stage yet is what you're saying... and verge will be the one to take it there is what you're saying... ive come to the conclusion that the verge ambassadors on twitter are borderline retarded.
3748 2018-04-02 16:17:27 In short term don't you think that majority will hold on to their safe haven, to the USD?  Then crisis will push them to the crypto?

3753 2018-04-02 16:16:11 Is there proof as clear as day that the precious metal markets are manipulated and suppressed? Arguably, no.  They've covered their tracks just enough, but it is obvious when considering the amount of evidence over the years to support the claim.  Crypto will follow.

3841 2018-04-02 16:07:37 Have you noticed that crypto currency critics tend to abandon their skepticism when it comes to governments, banking, and financial systems despite their widespread abuses and catastrophic failures?
3842 2018-04-02 16:07:32 I get yas, all I was saying is that finite resources wind up being too expensive and pointless to extract. With crypto we can always "tweak" things to make it meaningful again. Whether moving decimals, removing difficulty bombs, forking to PoS.. there's always a way.

3879 2018-04-02 16:03:02 If you bought crypto a few months ago and are sad you haven't made money or are "rich" yet, then you're a certified idiot and should probably take your money out and invest in some swamp land in Florida.
3880 2018-04-02 16:03:00 You shouldn’t block people for telling the truth. He is a scammer. He blocks people who criticise his fake calls. He is shit and your rep won’t bode well if you publicly follow him too. People like Ched make top calls. Yes he also supports Philakone which is disappointing though

3928 2018-04-02 15:56:14 What makes you think I lost money with btc? I've been hodling bitcoin and following crypto since April 7th, 2013. I've flipped a few shitcoins and sold a few btc near the top; 16k. I'd advise anyone to stay away from xrp.

3930 2018-04-02 15:56:06 You guys remember when y’all were “thinking about going full time crypto”? Lmfaoooooo
3931 2018-04-02 15:56:04 Take note @lepinks22
3932 2018-04-02 15:55:55 I feel like I am seeing less and less crypto charting on the twitter recently....
3933 2018-04-02 15:55:35 Ah yes... you need a blue lightning bolt...that's why I didn't spot it.......  or... The Lite coin Letter L with the lightning Bolt in front of it... 

I need someone to design me a new logo too I think instead of this generic one... crypto holder defender! 
3934 2018-04-02 15:55:24 bored with Illuminati talk  
3935 2018-04-02 15:55:17 If we do t control these Crooks who manipulate this business then Crypto will have a slow death. Wake up people we are been taken for a ride. #stopcryptocrooks
3936 2018-04-02 15:55:14 Essentia is very attractive for investors because it has a developed white paper and an excellent team. I hope in the future the project is able to give good profits. As for me I joined this project. #Crypto #Blockchain #Crowdfunding #Essentia #dApps #decentralized #ethereum
3937 2018-04-02 15:55:09 これは私も大いに期待してますね。
あちこちで進む国の法整備も後押しして、実態経済の崩れに則して界隈が一気に息を吹き返す世界を想像してしまいます。

3942 2018-04-02 15:54:33 You guys grasp at almost anything. Losing market share and value makes an object stronger. Think what you want. Ver and #fakesatoshi have done their best to destroy the crypto space. Good luck with your shitcoin

3951 2018-04-02 15:53:48 Wise words. It’s easy to forget the big picture
3952 2018-04-02 15:53:41 Risky investments Risky rewards. Invest in Property, business ownership and stocks! Don’t get discouraged by crypto. I’ve lost plenty in non crypto! Keep up the investing!
3953 2018-04-02 15:53:40 Cool, crypto makes its first gains in several days while stocks have lost all gains since 2018. Markets are weird
3954 2018-04-02 15:53:25 Most of that is happening in the broader community and not at the business level.

An actual business (crypto or otherwise) that adopts the behavior you just referenced will not survive for long.
3955 2018-04-02 15:53:22  В спецификации первого обновления сети Ethereum по переходу на протокол Casper указано введение гибридного POW/POS майнинга, при котором награду классических POW майнеров уменьшат с 3 до 0,6 ETH. #bitcoin #blockchain #Bounty #crypto #invest #running #travel #ico #bounty
3956 2018-04-02 15:53:19 I mentioned the Wiki link. Read it again. And it absolutely makes sense to use multiple indicators to confirm data. Anyone who doesn't is trading an ineffective and dangerous strategy.
3957 2018-04-02 15:53:11 Spending many hours everyday to rise above noobie... With you we learn quickly... 
3958 2018-04-02 15:53:11 The chart has my name on it, but check all their tweets, they do this multiple times a day to people. What are you talking about here? > "Also check the CMF equation and use OBV until it's fixed"

I use the OBV, I even recommend that people use it in tandem.

3978 2018-04-02 15:50:26 Gold is a precious metal. Blockchain allows the tokenization of real-world assets such as Real Estate (Global Real Estate Value: 217 Trillion)

Market Cap:
Gold: $7.07 Trillion
Crypto: $0.26 Trillion

Does one of these options look undervalued?

3991 2018-04-02 15:48:16 The amount of hate crypto gets because folks act like reading graphs and charting resistance lines is some masters degree level challenge is fucking comical to me

3994 2018-04-02 15:47:53 Actually I think a more accurate account of affairs would be to state that Core hijacked the name to make something that was not cash. They are the ones who are trying to use the Bitcoin name unfairly for something different than the white paper originally wanted.

4012 2018-04-02 15:45:07 It would be most beneficial for everyone to just hold.

If all the ones who bought in December sell now, we'll easily lose another 20%.

Keep them here, lesson learned.
Crypto has a bright future.
4013 2018-04-02 15:45:06 Have you considered it’s not the coin you think it is? Maybe if the BCH agenda wasn’t to attack BTC with all their original chain crap etc then you might do better. Also, you are seen as a copy. Whether you like it or not, that’s fact
4014 2018-04-02 15:45:04 Right now you should be buying eth instead of bitcoin, xlm instead of xrp, omg instead of ven, EOS instead of ada, drgn instead of neo and Ethorse and fun instead of everything else.

4058 2018-04-02 15:39:37 I strongly agree with the need of value before projects like $trx are worth multibillions. Working products  should be the focus by both crypto project teams and investors

4060 2018-04-02 15:39:12 Higher minded crypto projects say things like: 

Our token is not a speculative asset and its value is not a concern of the project. 

This strikes me as both disingenuous and incorrect in framing. 

Why not admit $ is a motivator then optimize for the long-term token value?

4072 2018-04-02 15:37:46 Read Orwell people. Things are never binary. Bad movements and those seeking to take away liberty always do it behind the guise of safety and love using fear of races/racism or fear of murder or fear of financial debt to move the sheep into place. Sheep herders use dogs.

4076 2018-04-02 15:37:04 As someone who first learned traditional fundamental analysis, my biggest issue is the lack there of it in the crypto sphere. It makes sense bc most of that analysis is based on the past, but I’m curious what sort of fundamental/traditional models you use within crypto. Cheers

4088 2018-04-02 15:35:50 I recommend you the iShook project. Really a good company in the world of crypto currency. If you want to earn, then join and watch Twitter @ishookinc
4089 2018-04-02 15:35:44 Severely disagree
1) Philippines and Thailand have higher viloent gun deaths
2) rational fear since the majority of the Islamic world is at war and  created groups that cut heads off people.
3) that's how you win wars
4) crypto hasnt changed since San Bernardino shooter
4090 2018-04-02 15:35:31 When I read the tweets , it does make me  wander, if anyone has a crypto market Knowledge! $50 a TRX !? If I say 0.02 soon. TRX  did dip when the market was all green,  is a Game over, the Wales control the price ans you will never ever see TRX even 0.50.
4091 2018-04-02 15:35:27 Seems like nasdaq, s&p and a few other stocks indicators are having a hard time.

In case of a period of a bear market for the traditional stocks, will investors move their money to crypto?

4093 2018-04-02 15:35:10 bought some, but could not find any sale related info. no bonus. do advice.
4094 2018-04-02 15:35:00 Slide 1: a non-issue. When enough people adopt crypto, nobody will convert it to fiat

Slide 2: he has a point. But still more democratic than today where one guy at the FED decides all that

Slide 3: will be solved soon

Slide 4: seems he ran out of arguments
4095 2018-04-02 15:34:50 I understand your point. But bitcoin is to USD as litecoin is to bitcoin.   When you transfer litecoin you are only tranfering litecoin, forget the traditional fiat. It's unnecessary in the transaction.  It will be a while before crypto is fully accepted and understood.
4096 2018-04-02 15:34:43 Just from the number of features it has, including dapps? Sorry was away from twitter all day!

4098 2018-04-02 15:34:38 Nope. Even shameful radical people hide amongst virtuous causes.

4107 2018-04-02 15:33:44 4. You're missing the big picture - crypto will act as a hedge against the dollar losing its dominance as the reserve currency of the earth - foreign central banks will start to become the largest holders.

4144 2018-04-02 15:29:19 I think the best criticisms against your views are:

1. You are too US-focused: for those with hyperinflating currency (venezuela) or bank haircuts (cyprus) crypto is super important.

2. It's too early for most dapps to work (ethereum's value prop has yet to be justified).

4162 2018-04-02 15:27:39 Other than being created by $OSTK, tZERO is in no way related to the retail business $OSTK is engaged in and this is more of a capital markets play to diversify their business and get exposure to crypto world. Is that a fair assumption?

4196 2018-04-02 15:24:29 What I feel that the old players in the game have run their course, what interests me are the new ICO’s like QuickX which seem promising and worth waiting another month till their official launch

Thanks to you, I've become passionate not just about making money from crypto, but about truly educating myself in the space. It would be amazing to meet the man who started me on that journey :)
4201 2018-04-02 15:24:03 Interesting episode. I think for the crypto and blockchain communities we need to move to decentralised social platforms such as @MastodonProject and create our very own instances. One way of solving that issue. ;)

4250 2018-04-02 15:18:35 Bitcoin has a limited supply. Eventually enough people will buy it that they will be trading with decimal amounts that won't move the price as much. Just volume.

4271 2018-04-02 15:16:19 you also realize that if ripple succeeds, it will mean a bridge between crypto and non-crypto on a massive scale right?

4340 2018-04-02 15:09:20 whats is the legal structure of digipharm ?
Digipharm is a limited company (ltd) registered in Zug, Switzerland. The Digipharm team is located globally however several of the core team members are based in Switzerland.

4341 2018-04-02 15:09:19 Ok last year the CEO promoted the ideas: 1) an ICO of between 250-500 2) an easy sale of the retail arm 3) a stock lending platform with 120bn inventory and 1% revenue 4) token exchange. 

None of these happened or appear likely. Additionally crypto bear mkt. Understand now?

4348 2018-04-02 15:08:46 So it’s a quarter of the way into the year and on pace for half of last year, which I assume were mostly created in the last quarter?  Big deal. Also this is “inception” not total. You can’t have infinite growth in new funds. Dumb post.

4355 2018-04-02 15:07:46 I do agree with your theory in the sense the cartels/governments want to control the market and if they can't they'll be buying and owning it. But they hardly need to spend much. A simple policy, then they'll watch the market crash itself.

4377 2018-04-02 15:06:11 the banks dont trust eachother - they specifically mention that, but  they do trust the market and market structures, like commodities, oil,  gold, real estate. They trust in those, so a crypto that is said to have  a value based on retail value (and FI, and companies) is perfect

4471 2018-04-02 14:59:05 the whole point of crypto is its push technology, debit is pull tech nology 
it defeats the whole point

4473 2018-04-02 14:58:56 1/ I question whether there will be a category 'store of value' in crypto. Currencies are held as a reserve because of what they can buy. If they go out of favor as payment instrument, usually their value also goes down equally. Gold is an exception. (see 2 for rest)

お金って結局、発行体の信頼に基づく債券だろ。要は発行体が信頼できるかが価値って事だろ。

PoWで発行体という中央集権の枠組みを越えようとしているのは分かるけど、価値の裏付けがPoW(電気代)である必要あるか？

4555 2018-04-02 14:50:04 From there website I understand these.
1. It's a platform (like ETH) which can be used to build upon.
2. It's highly scalable and has many real world uses.
3. It's is build to support enterprises like pharmaceuticals & automobile etc.

It's use cases are the reason it quite hyped

4624 2018-04-02 14:44:00 So even if you could not do it in 1995, the required pieces were moving in the right direction.

Crypto Currency does not have this inevitability. We don't just need some small technology improvement to make it work. The very design of crypto is self-limiting.
4625 2018-04-02 14:44:00 こんなもん作ってないで仮想通貨まとめろや！って言われそうですが、将軍にネタ提供できたならよかったですｗ

4631 2018-04-02 14:43:28 Every time they sell some guy in another country buys a piece. Let's remember it's a finite supply. They can try but won't succeed. Freshly printed money will just inflate the price to ridiculousness.
4632 2018-04-02 14:43:21 Maybe it’s even better for us, because more techies  can afford buying some crypto now. The devs should make most of the money in this space, not speculators.

4652 2018-04-02 14:42:01 I read your article about Cartel. Good job. 
I wonder if the same thing happened to Nasdaq because the Bitcoin chart is so much like Nasdaq's?
4653 2018-04-02 14:42:01 Can agree. Was looking at gpus. This crypto-inflation is fucking bull, waiting for it to fail in all honesty. Crypto was made for the intent of purchasing and selling illegal goods, only the people who starts at the beginning are gonna get anything from it now tbh.

4748 2018-04-02 14:32:35 Yep. I’m so new to Cryptos that I can’t tell which are shit coins. So I’ve just been following BTC,ETH, ETC, and kind of LTC... I will also start to look at VEN & NEO.

4751 2018-04-02 14:32:25 I’ve believed Crypto is massively manipulated for some time.
4752 2018-04-02 14:32:22 Always nice to hear you talking about life / crypto's. You're a great guy! 
4753 2018-04-02 14:32:21 Topic: Where the crypto markets are heading given that we had numerous weeks of positive news (SEC, France, Korea ...) and yet the weakness persists? What will it take to see the market rebounding from here?
4754 2018-04-02 14:32:19 Plus, 100% sure that will have the exact opposite effect of coffee.

4760 2018-04-02 14:31:43 Anyone who bought crypto in December and is upset because three months later it "hasn't worked out for them" should probably sell and move on to another asset class. Time to once again weed out the get-rich-quickers. #bitcoin by #ErikVoorhees

4889 2018-04-02 14:17:10 In what way would you say it is 'not a crypto'? It is a cryptographically secured digital asset, just like many others such at Bitcoin. Bitcoin has a very high concentration of ownership in a few hands... yet, considered a 'crypto', so clearly the distribution is not a factor

4997 2018-04-02 14:04:07 1. I think biggest problem with #crypto going mainstream is that people are confused with terminology and descriptions, they can't just understand it and i don't blame them. What is bitcoin? Decentralized bla bla... Wait... What is decentralized? What is centralized...

5013 2018-04-02 14:01:47 自分はキャバクラとか好きじゃないし行きたくないけれど、たまに付き合いでいくことがある。
そこでブランドものとか褒めるとすごく私達高級取りで若干僕たちのこと軽く馬鹿にしてくるキャバ嬢がいる。
多分僕のほうが給料もFXで稼いでるお金も君たちより断然高いと思うが、本当に若いって怖いと思う。

5032 2018-04-02 13:59:58 Check book "12 immutable laws of marketing" + google "long tail". There could be similarities in how it will manifest in crypto.

There will be (I would guess) many crypto markets with few big players and a long tail of many players with a smaller market caps.

5034 2018-04-02 13:59:45 "You just got in early and got lucky by holding" said the crypto trader, who has traded away half of his bitcoin in the last 3 months
5035 2018-04-02 13:59:41 good day, #crypto universe!  have you downloaded the #LindaV2 wallet yet?  with the chart looking good this morning, we could be seeing the wedge breakout soon! $linda masternodes lowered to 2 million, faster speeds, great rewards!  #lindacoin is a sure thing in 2018.  $btc $eth
5036 2018-04-02 13:59:41 If you came to crypto in December and your portfolio became 2X value in a month and you kept your position, you shouldn't be so upset or surprised now your portfolio 50% lower in value. If you are one of those people, you should sell and get out of #cryptocurrency.

5044 2018-04-02 13:58:16 I have never seen an “announcement to make an announcement” end well in crypto.  Ever.  Take profit beforehand, there’s no way the news won’t be a let-down.
5045 2018-04-02 13:58:15 Wow. Catching up on twitter and I see @litecoindad getting bashed. To me he has always been transparent. When I first took interest in $LTC he answered my question and we DM’d and he helped me out. I feel he’s my friend in #crypto Head up man #LitecoinFam
5046 2018-04-02 13:58:08 The reason #bitcoin #eth in fact #crypto is on the down is because all the newbies  “get rich quick kids” lost money at Xmas they got involved in something they didn’t understand if they could make it easier for the average joe to get involved in crypto / #blockchain etc then 
5047 2018-04-02 13:58:08 The truth is one of the most valuable skills in todays society is the prioritization.

5053 2018-04-02 13:57:38 Your posts are usually spot on. This time however I think you are wrong. You show a rise to 9600 before the next drop. I the bounce from 6400-7100 is as high as it will get this time and that in 10 hours from now we will go down again to 6200 in 12 hours from now

5063 2018-04-02 13:56:10 Crypto crow a buzz helps. But my lord Jeff seems to have caught the short term bug and lately his spirits are being broken in it for money are some mine far as crypto. Other is jehuGarcia  Excellent chanel to learn my favorite is his by far
5064 2018-04-02 13:56:08 Crypto's decentralization is manifested in a) multiple blockchains and multiple assets/tokens, and b) multiple wallet implementations  (full nodes, light clients, web wallets, etc). A world of only full-node-running Bitcoiner maximalists is less diverse, less decentralized.
5065 2018-04-02 13:56:05 People dont understand how important ethereum is to other cryptos if you are not buying at these lows sit back and watch it launch!

5079 2018-04-02 13:54:25 I coined a new crypto term (pun intended). COC (confidence, optimism, clarity). We need more COC, less FUD. I have no shame in saying that I love COC.

5082 2018-04-02 13:54:15 Anyone who bought crypto in December and is upset because three months later it "hasn't worked out for them" should probably sell and move on to another asset class. Time to once again weed out the get-rich-quickers. #bitcoin by #ErikVoorhees

5088 2018-04-02 13:53:12 You cant be friends with and associate with one of the best known scammers in the crypto community and complain about other scammers. Reality check
5089 2018-04-02 13:53:12 It does seem that you are doing the work they want directly or indirectly. The article is useful but leans on the FUD side. Maybe a follow up article that details more effectively how to combat them OR how an escape trajectory is possible. Adoption via daily spending..?

5091 2018-04-02 13:53:01 I'm a convinced #crypto guy and Im not reloading yet, so why would a nocoiner? The psychology is actually the inverse: the more the price declines, the more the store-of-value use case is impaired. We'll hit bedrock demand at some point, but arguably nobody knows where that is.

5279 2018-04-02 13:25:31 I 100% agree with you. If the opportunity happens though I would like them to be able to use it. Not that they would ever let the video out. For the vegas shooting they have dozens of reports of the FBI erasing phone videos. Crazy word we live in. They want the control not us.

5282 2018-04-02 13:25:09 STEEM blockchain SN . Its what theyre concerned about, a blockchain version of them. They knew they are too big n ppl 2 lazy.  They wanted mixed attention because they caused crypto fear until they launch their own shits. This privacy stuff is not new, y'all just forgot
5283 2018-04-02 13:24:58 Exchanges need to stop suspicious  trading accounts... maybe make that part of the terms of having an account, malicious trading activities will result in frozen accounts. Exchanges have just as much to lose as bitcoin investors.

5294 2018-04-02 13:23:59 That's a really good point. Because most of the utility tokens are going to have real cases, they're also going to get funds and injection of fiat from outside of the crypto market. When fiat pairings come to help facilitate this, how will the cartel suppress the market?
5295 2018-04-02 13:23:55 Брехня. Это отрицание наций и национального государства как такового. Отрицание национальных ценностей. Типичный либерал-космополитизм из уст львовского еврея, который почему-то от своего еврейства не отказывается.

5543 2018-04-02 12:54:33 The power of blockchain but by them trying to patent everything leads the power back to the few and against what crypto represents
5544 2018-04-02 12:54:29 The underlying problem with the #crypto market is still present. Every little spike $btc & $eth see is sold for tokens that do nothing or have done nothing thus killing momentum and making it more attractive to short.

5547 2018-04-02 12:53:50 The thing about crypto is that you can’t really put it in one box so to speak. It acts as a stock, but it isn’t one. Acts as an asset, but it isn’t. Acts as currency, but far too volatile to be a currency.

5582 2018-04-02 12:49:28 If they are locked in a classroom or happen to be recording while an event happened I think the footage would be extremely important. I have also seen a lot of videos of students starting fights with teachers and the video shows the kids starting it.
5583 2018-04-02 12:49:24 Something smells fishy about this FaceBook debacle. Why does it seem like we’re getting brainwashed into excepting social media regulations? This whole thing reminds me of the Patriot Act. This combined with net neutrality is a problem for the non 1%.

5592 2018-04-02 12:48:47 I think TheLegendaryTwatter isn't calling out all crypto from FIAT narrative, but a specifically $BTC, from $BCH narrative

To clarify, I think ALL cryptos are still experimental & work in progress. I like the promise, but I admit the hype was way ahead of reality the least
5593 2018-04-02 12:48:40 It's not just 2013 though. This has happened many times, look before 2013 even, that was not the first cycle. BTC tends to be quite cyclical. 3~4k was always very possible and ppl laughed at that in the beginning, now they don't laugh that much.

So we are just waiting now to see if BTC get's propped up at the 7k level. We see issues on the RSI with keeping it up here so it's going to take a big push to move this up any further. If not..
5626 2018-04-02 12:44:16 If a business moves from non crypto to crypto - imagine the growth for all, and imagine btc and how great their position is. We should be supportive to all crypto that is trying to put down a bridge to the real world and 98% of the world that is not in crypto yet. /3

5664 2018-04-02 12:37:39 Yeah, listen to the guy that thinks a coin with a supply of 10 Billion has a chance of hitting $100. Jesus, I wish people would stop talking.
5665 2018-04-02 12:37:34 Then consider that you're not the only crypto tuber I follow. I REALLY don't want to turn on notoficstions for the 30+ people I follow because I don't want my phone going off 24/7 for shit posting.

5674 2018-04-02 12:36:01 Tbh, Twitter is sort of to blame for low interactions. As someone in Twitter to learn and validate, Yes, i want to see your posts and follow you to learn, but I deff don't want to see every time you post and get a notification for it. Its too binary.
5675 2018-04-02 12:36:00 I think kids should be allowed to have phones. We need to count on they to show us what's happening in the school. If they were able to film an event then we wouldn't have to relay on police for information

5677 2018-04-02 12:35:53 Bitcoins and crypto-currencies are  "fake money"! They are only "speculative" assets and so very dangerous!

5710 2018-04-02 12:32:20 Currently the mighty Dollar/Euro/Whatever Fiat trumps Crypto, i mean we base our crypto earning success in fiat so our brains can comprehend.

5810 2018-04-02 12:16:36 Spot on #Super_Crypto, with you on the collusion to control and manipulate $BTC. I regret that we as a greater community are unable to standup to the tyranny of these people. We do have the #POWER to change the status quo. Just believe in ourselves.

5834 2018-04-02 12:14:11 Crypto-currencies rip the mask off the banks and the deceptions they weave!  Digital money can be moved in a matter of seconds, and verified and confirmed in a matter minutes, and leave a permanent digital record accounting, that is transparent, of each and every transaction.

5848 2018-04-02 12:11:54 I'm extremely bullish about the future of the crypto market because soon everyone will be able to buy alts directly, WITHOUT having to trade through Bitcoin first. This is huge as it will finally break Bitcoins' strangle hold on massive coins like Vechain #Vechain

While we wait for the cryptos to bake could we discuss some of the more serious white papers with the purpose of preparing for what's coming. Also could you investigate the crypto Weiss report I'm hearing about. Cheers. Justanidea

5975 2018-04-02 11:55:04 No problem. Corrections create opportunities. New trends start when corrections end. For many #Crypto , challenge is to build evidence of a bottom. Develop a strategy to re-enter long hodl. Can also short the correction, but takes trading skill & experience.

6066 2018-04-02 11:42:53 I can see that. But considering long term, I'd actually believe bitcoin to lose a lot of its value. I mean, it frankly is the dinosaur in the crypto world and only it's name won't make up for the technical limitations it comes with.

6089 2018-04-02 11:38:45 You two idiots are why crypto in general can't be taken seriously. You have zero clue what happened with $PAC as a currency, they have followed through with everything they said they would and more and the price is as promised 1000:1 at time of redemption. Great job by their team
6090 2018-04-02 11:38:32 Screw you buddy. I'm buying
6091 2018-04-02 11:38:31 Seeing your entire feed focused on bashing crypto, I almost feel bad that you clearly are devastated by the fact that you never invested and try to make up for it by convincing yourself it will fail. What a sad timeline lmao
6092 2018-04-02 11:38:31 Does it matter ? A little to late if it was supposed to matter? $EOS mainnet approaching. No "Crypto Kitties" will be able to slow it down, and transactions will be feeless (this can send Nano/Rai down the toiled too). 

Should talk more on plasma & scaling imho, not maxcap.
6093 2018-04-02 11:38:16 In crypto, you can't do primary market investment without taking secondary market conditions into consideration. Thus I am trading occasionally only for better understanding of the market. Any profit is a plus.

As someone who's into blockchain and crypto currencies with a good understanding of what's going on, why would you still invest in Bitcoin considering that it's clearly technically limited over other chains, like Ethereum?

6217 2018-04-02 11:21:32 Oh Wise Panda, why do you call XRP a scam?  Yes it is not decentralized, and perhaps not even a crypto currency (more of an interbank settlement system), but they never claimed it was either of these things, did they?

6223 2018-04-02 11:21:05 Bitcoin/crypto is a digital asset that the world will turn to once the bubble pops. The banks are out of gimmicks. The bubble will occur in 2020(imo) and all hell will broke loose. Get ready for hyperinflation and a worthless dollar.

6230 2018-04-02 11:20:06 Hopefully. It’s disgusting how the media heralds scammers who started Ripple, Stellar,I(di)ota just bec these have a (centralized) face to worship. People with an actual technical background (not me) have discredited all of these so it’s sad this is the crypto my dad reads about

6309 2018-04-02 11:08:32 Hm still, the same would apply. You can easily tell it's a bot when the orders have the same amounts and/or are placed instantly after someone places a buy/sell order, to usually outbid them

6316 2018-04-02 11:07:44 Until an elastic money supply can be demonstrated to solve price stability and/or inequality in crypto, it’s very reasonable. At minimum, increases overall trust in ecosystem value. Nothing wrong with allowing market demand for M elasticity and price stability to emerge naturally

6327 2018-04-02 11:06:30 What I would invest. I should mention also that despite my short trading positions, I have held on to a certain amount of crypto always and am not looking to part with it. But for new money to move you need a new use case or the prospect of a quick 100%, ie prices low enough.
6328 2018-04-02 11:06:17 Whats a „Blockchain“?
6329 2018-04-02 11:06:08 Since it's apparently "prediction monday" in crypto, here goes (I'm no more of an expert than the youtube-leaders) :
ETH will drop to < 200$ within one month
BTC will be >18k by Dec 1, 2018
One top5 exch.(worldwide) will go down by March 2019
ARK will be in top 10 markcap by 2019

6350 2018-04-02 11:02:54 @bethereumteam also wants to make betting a social activity again. The platform does not rely on centralized bookmakers operating as middlemen. Through the use of blockchain technology, Bethereum will facilitate global social betting.

6361 2018-04-02 11:01:36 100x!! Mmm ... i wonder if we will see 100x’s anymore. Have you hit a 100x since ur start in crypto? Ive hit 10x twice during dec bull run
6362 2018-04-02 11:01:29 Completely agree - I say shake the tree even more until what's left is an unwavering global community in support of the inevitable changes afoot as a result of the desire of people to have choice and the underpinning technology that is crypto.
6363 2018-04-02 11:01:26 Should I continue trying to learn margin trading with these strict new EU laws coming in?

Oh wait @BitMEXdotcom is registered in Seychelles East Africa 
6364 2018-04-02 11:01:23 @bethereumteam They want to change the way that we think about online betting by making it more transparent and secure.

6465 2018-04-02 10:48:06 By making it rise high and fast you are already making it hard for the coin to sustain its price. The rest is like a domino.

6467 2018-04-02 10:47:16 50% to 70% bounce expected...
6468 2018-04-02 10:47:07 @SatoshiLite As someone who has looked up to you, this is devastating. 

I really don't even know what to say, you mischaracterized a great member of the community giving trolls (the ones who ruin the crypto) ammunition. 

I believe in the product, but frankly disappointed in you

And the whole bitconnect

6474 2018-04-02 10:46:33 So, control part of the supply so it's easier to push the moves, make it rise high and fast and then use media fud plus ur stash to cause a chain reaction downwards. Nothing that fancy really.

6586 2018-04-02 10:28:24 "Financial elite has recognized that Bitcoin and Crypto in general is a threat to their existence"

6589 2018-04-02 10:27:52 There is to much emotional speculation attached to the market.  BTC will be a huge part of crypto for a long time and XRP will be valued based on its usage. If it’s market cap succeeds BTC then that’s great. $XRP 4life
6590 2018-04-02 10:27:50 Today's dilemma: Does it make sense to do crypto code on a machine where oh-my-zsh and supervim are installed?
How easy would it be to pown at least ONE of the gazillion auto-updating all-powerful scripts in there?

6600 2018-04-02 10:27:14 The whole Futures market as a inflection point is something we were warned about on December, which made a lot of people sell and now they are waiting to rebuy in some years from now, that's why imo price will not recover anytime soon.

6617 2018-04-02 10:25:08 Hi Tony, how about having Air Asia accept crypto payments alongside Big Coin.. Take us to the Moon, Bro, I beg you ( post hodl syndrome) . By the way we met once about 15 years ago at Nik "Bull" Azmi's house, when he was looking to finance a movie project.
6618 2018-04-02 10:25:07 some banks in the UK have stopped allowing transactions to known crypto sites, stopping people buying them
6619 2018-04-02 10:25:03 So basically we can go up or down from here

6622 2018-04-02 10:24:28 Quite useful and I like the planning guide too. However - no mention of any of the legal elements which the white paper should contain. Risk factors, how that crypto raised will be held (how much will be converted into fiat over what time frame), lock-ins and management Holdings

6625 2018-04-02 10:23:24 That's good to hear Jay, I believe there is a concern that it could disrupt the #ETN network as well as wallet transfers. Also congratulations on your 8th mobile mining payout, well done.
6626 2018-04-02 10:23:21 And even if you're having a blast, don't forget to make a few social media pauses! :D
6627 2018-04-02 10:23:20 At least one could see how someone naively observing the last 3 years of US and global politics, as well as Bitcoin and other crypto communities, might find that believable. But I think we still have quite a lot to try before we need to resign ourselves to that conclusion.

6636 2018-04-02 10:21:59 While I wish I sold the top back in January, my consolation is that I haven't bought much since then. ICO's yes, but even then I've been selective. Especially glad I didn't buy anything to hold, even when everyone was FOMOing into my beloved $icx. We'll go lower; I'll buy then.

6713 2018-04-02 10:08:50 Absolutely spot on. Those who entered around Dec 2017 believed crypto would be an instant winning lotto ticket. Instant, No. Winning lotto ticket, maybe someday.
6714 2018-04-02 10:08:29 Then you are fine. Buy the future dips, pump the hours in and you will soon have enough money to move to Tibet to become a Monk.

6716 2018-04-02 10:08:21 I honestly think the market will recover when these companies start growing and making big announcements. That's what gets people excited, they are more inclined to put there money in because they believe in it the company   #crypto#tron#ncash#xvg#@binance @Coingorilla1
6717 2018-04-02 10:08:02 まさしく線認識ですか、、
OCRの理屈でいけそうというのはなるほどと思いました。大変勉強になりました、、、。
6718 2018-04-02 10:07:41 ううむ、難しいところですよね。世界全体でみると、VIX戦略は無数の中の一つでしょうし、やはり価格上昇には投機の期待があり、その背景には高いボラがあるので。ただ早く全体が上げ相場になって欲しいのは完全同意です。笑

6723 2018-04-02 10:07:05 Thanks for reminding me of the time i was mining and made only cents per day and stopped because i thought it didn't make any sense. #cpumining
6724 2018-04-02 10:07:01 Yeah exactly. Also if the public thinks crypto becomes a going concern (can legitimately go to zero) then it may become a self fulfilling prophecy. Or the risk premium may be so high that prices can never appreciate

6737 2018-04-02 10:04:53 色々な考え方があるので一概に言えませんが、VIX戦略を実践する人々が増えることでボラリティが減少してビットコインの価格が安定すれば通貨としての利用が広まり、仮想通貨全体の価格上昇に繋がれば嬉しいです。

6745 2018-04-02 10:03:37 Buying crypto to pay for Amazon gift cards does not help adoption at all. Just saying. It doesn't move the needle.
6746 2018-04-02 10:03:36 with all regulation taking place and VAT and capital gains tax coming do you think crypto's will still be around by the end of the year if not banned completely? so not sure if this will matter much
6747 2018-04-02 10:03:29 I do not think I agree with this statement at all. Alt markets crash whenever bitcoin crashes. Not looking at the bitcoin chart in crypto is the same as not looking at traffic lights in traffic.
6748 2018-04-02 10:03:17 Thanks @XRPTrump - I thought, given the SEC's increasingly aggressive attitude towards crypto exchanges it would be nice to hear from @ripple about their regulatory and compliance position regarding this.

6970 2018-04-02 09:27:15 It's called "making a business decision" there is no loyalty in trading. You do what you have to do to make money or you loose out. Simple!

6972 2018-04-02 09:26:52 I just got in early last year. I think I have learned more from this dip than ever before. I dont follow the other ogs for calls I just like to see general trends. Thanks for not being a dick lol.

6979 2018-04-02 09:25:52 TBH the solution I'd actually favor is strong crypto with no deliberate weaknesses and a legal framework that allows forced update to compromise the endpoint under either warrant or national security provisions.

7074 2018-04-02 09:11:59 I keep assessing it differently. Specifically I think we will see the bottom earliest when the ETH/BTC decline stops and turns around. It shows all left-over ICO raisings getting liquidated now, including a good portion of BTC. Bottom will be reached when this selloff is over.

I have no allusions that it's anything other than terrible from a pure security perspective, but "3rd party only" which is the initial suggestion is worse since it's effectively no crypto for normal people.

7215 2018-04-02 08:52:29 If they stick around they will be in the profit imo. Like you said still early adopters.
7216 2018-04-02 08:52:23 If we want mass adoption, we need regulation
If we want massive volatility, you don't want it
7217 2018-04-02 08:52:20 Yep. Thanks for asking. And always researching and moving forward like you and mocho, low caps and quality ICO's to prepare for. Luckbox one of em
7218 2018-04-02 08:52:14 Can I ask how many coins you have staking and what return? I have just transfered some to my wallet and am staking them, just need to wait to they mature. I am curious of the returns.
7219 2018-04-02 08:52:09 +1600% sooo yea :)
7220 2018-04-02 08:51:54 Hi Tyler...awesome work you do, thankyou much...Im keen to get your thoughts on how, should the USD go back on the gold standard, affect the crypto space, from a marcro perspective?
7221 2018-04-02 08:51:54 Thanks Haejin you are consistent on forecasting when to ladder in but why so silent when time comes to ladder out or raise cash? I hope someone has not bought you out to keep quiet about that part :)
7222 2018-04-02 08:51:33 Before you start you seem to invalidate your entire argument. The single clearest point of crypto is the removal of a "trusted 3rd party" in transactions (amongst many other applications). How do cryptos fair in your analysis if you do require censorship resistance?
7223 2018-04-02 08:51:22 I am not really convinced of a state-owned VC fund. Governments tend to have a dismal performance at picking winners, and throwing money against the power of network effects is unlikely to succeed. Separating data from monopolists using anti-trust+crypto is more promising.
7224 2018-04-02 08:51:11 Sooner or later crypto adoption will be mainstream and at that moment clients of this kind of institutions will remember their current decisions and will behave appropriately.
7225 2018-04-02 08:50:43 The best way to maximize your profit in this crypto space is to do it yourself. For more knowledge on Technical Analysis contact me. 
N.B we give a 7 days trial period
7226 2018-04-02 08:50:42 Do you think we need some sort of regulation?
That will get so many people into crypto.
There would be less shady activities etc.

7281 2018-04-02 08:39:07 The big pumps like we saw in the first week of january always come after the bitcoin ATH. When news media spreads wild stories about 16 year old kids turning $10 into a million. People FOMO in altcoins because they are so cheap. So BTC needs to make it's move first.
7282 2018-04-02 08:39:05 looks like 5.5k /6k is the bottom....in may we maybe have some recovery in anticipation of blockchain week in new york ????  there is a lot possible this year, crypto is opening up for big investors and china opening up as well.

7369 2018-04-02 08:25:19 Apps encrypting their own data & unlocking with a PIN/passphrase? Not saying app devs won't roll their own crypto (or that they use crypto libs correctly), but that would fit with the present security model of Android/iOS permissions.
7370 2018-04-02 08:25:17 I put in more than incouod afford at one point but bitcoin was 1900 lol. I fixed that problem too.

7376 2018-04-02 08:24:09 Would be fun to know how many of the current bears, screaming for BTC to 3k, bought their first BTC way higher. 
Seems to me, these new pro's just want a better entry. 
Disclaimer: yes, we can go lower. Not calling BTC to 50k here.
7377 2018-04-02 08:23:56 Lol I think there are more then ya think many ppl fomo and sell that are the ppl who put more in it then the could afford

7388 2018-04-02 08:20:53 It only makes sense. Most of us have bought crypto with $BTC or $ETH pairing, but usually tools don't let you see other than $USD price movements. Now, If you can add the same to the charts, it'd be insane!

7525 2018-04-02 07:59:14 But then why make a point of -50% value of gold since the 80s? I think we can all agree that a metric of value is really how many lambos we can buy. Or ramen, in these times.   But prices could easily be manipulated in comparison to fiat. For crypto or commodities.

7652 2018-04-02 07:30:47 Goed dat je kritisch bent, Clemens, maar laat zeker niet na om wat dieper te gaan met je onderzoek: er zijn inderdaad veel crypto-piramidespellen (Bitconnect, cloudmining, sommige ICO's,...). Bitcoin is echter het tegenovergestelde van een piramidesysteem. Don't trust, verify.

7765 2018-04-02 07:13:13 Well, I strongly disagree with the very first sub-sentence: ``Crypto-backdoors for law enforcement is a reasonable position'' - but I'll keep reading.

7770 2018-04-02 07:12:45 One of the most promising coins on crypto, so undervalued. Not in a big exchange yet
7771 2018-04-02 07:12:30 I suppose. But don't we want nocoiners to become bitcoiners? Conversion is the only way to improve the health of the ecosystem

7809 2018-04-02 07:04:10 Paying in crypto can be complicated and that's something bway set out to change when he began #Digits, a crypto payment processor that connects any 16-digit debit or credit card number to a crypto wallet, turning that card into a crypto card.

8273 2018-04-02 05:40:58 Japan is friendly to crypto, it's just that apparently binance is not friendly to KYC, which is a problem of course, for binance, because non KYC=money laundering.

8281 2018-04-02 05:39:07 You were as bullish as it gets with crypto settings. Then we dumped very hard. Clearly default settings are better.

8316 2018-04-02 05:29:16 There are no leaders on Twitter, but there are some great people to connect with, and some great #crypto educational resources. Getting a bunch of followers takes a lot of effort and luck, but it doesn’t show real credibility. Credible content does that. Some people forget that.
8317 2018-04-02 05:28:49 Volume will be low for the foreseeable future. Millions of crypto traders just had a conversation with their accountants about the new tax rules where every trade is now a taxable action. 

This will force exchanges to add more fiat pairs for alts which will be a good thing

8399 2018-04-02 05:05:59 2/ At 0x, we are thinking 5-10 years out. My guess is that this time horizon is too long for crypto investors that recently got into the space. There are too many projects. If you didn't slog through the many years when Bitcoin was the only game in town everything feels slow.

8404 2018-04-02 05:04:41 IF you guys are really serious about this project why don't you do a buy back plan like you originally promised! PAY to get into bigger exchanges?? You all gone quite, pretty sure u could have prevented the price from plummeting if you had just buy your own coins.

I think it will be tough to see under $5500. 

Too many waiting with large amounts of fiat waiting to buy #BTC at that price range.

8409 2018-04-02 05:01:14 Very interesting innovative solution. I like your idea. This project can greatly improve the crypto market ...
8410 2018-04-02 05:01:07 I agree, was more of an example where the industry agreed it’s a fair initial premium (ignoring negotiation, etc). For crypto networks, we may see some arbitrary premium assigned to tokens that do provide governance. Not being able to model it now doesn’t mean there’s no value.

8432 2018-04-02 04:58:16 There needs to be an organization that pushes for trader friendly legislation in crypto at large. Someone's gotta be working on a nonprofit that deals on that. If Wallstreet and big pharma can do it crypto should be no different. #PrecidentMatters
8433 2018-04-02 04:58:11 many people are losing interest on cryptocurrency because of whats happening on the market..seems like THE attack on CRYPTO is actually working ..hopefully someone with great influence help the cryptospace recover and bring back its former glory.#cryptocurrency
8434 2018-04-02 04:58:08 If you are investing in #crypto you need to look at public sentiment and TA.  They go hand in hand... I'm very bullish about crypto long term,  but until the media and public, along with chart investors stop talking about #Bitcoin going under $6k, you should wait to invest.

8465 2018-04-02 04:50:31 Just don't tweet because there is nothing else to tweet about. There is no magic reward that you know or for that matter anyone else. The crypto world is very much in its infancy, no one knows anything but surely got in early and just got lucky.
8466 2018-04-02 04:50:28 Donations are donations. So I would take anything. Especially Crypto.. When it comes to buying things tho, I would say no. Just bc the value goes up and down. You might sell something for $20 worth of btc, and next week it'll be worth $5. But it can also be worth $200. Up to you.

8469 2018-04-02 04:49:55 It would make for an interesting legal case where the argument is not on general crypto-to-crypto but specific crypto.

Making the "attack surface" much wider for broad and vague criticisms that however sound ominous to the general public.

Is it usable for 3rd party txns?
8507 2018-04-02 04:41:46 @coinbase. you'll have to act fast! crypto supporters are getting turned off and staying away from the market as evidence by crashing prices. Unfortunately, most are relying on CB listings of new cryptos. Act NOW  or CB crashes along with cryptos.

8579 2018-04-02 04:26:34 March is usually bearish sentiment (not sure why). The risk is that global economic outlook improves, and fiats are not debased by quantitative easing. So crypto coins stop seeming worthwhile, but blockchain and fiat linked tokens abound.

8743 2018-04-02 03:56:19 It's a reasonable proposition. Wrong, perhaps, but perfectly reasonable. It's unreasonable to say crypto people are irresponsible for not making it happen, and that they are "going dark" when they are "going light".

そう、あのEIPは冗談要素ないですよね。
8753 2018-04-02 03:54:12 Started to win. FOMO won again. When all is said and done, crypto is fun, sorry for the pun, got gotta get down to 32 before we see the Moon. Now you see im a goon and somehow made a shitty rap to no tune, this dude threw down some bars, so I had to rise it to the stars.

8778 2018-04-02 03:49:53 The current fundamentals for crypto (constructive regulation, ETFs, france, fiat gateways) is very very bullish. Only a matter of time before the market acts rationally and responds bullishly in turn. Very different than last dump.. no fud or anything.

9054 2018-04-02 02:58:33 Lol) So, you think it will go there straight? There is a lots of profit that can be taken. So, tards should stop to call 0 and realize that there is a scalping heaven
9055 2018-04-02 02:58:27 What do you think, guys? My take is don’t hold any crypto you aren’t comfortable going to zero. It might go to the moon. Put a marker on the table, but don’t bet the farm.

9124 2018-04-02 02:47:12 Non pas du tout! J'était juste curieux car ca semblait être une opportunité d'investissement qui rapporterais peut etre dans le futur - un peu comme le web des années 90 (qui ajd a fait des millionnaires pour ceux qui ont investie tot). Jai donc investie en crypto mais pas bcp.

9128 2018-04-02 02:46:16 Followed ALL. Please follow back if you can. If I missed you please let me know TOGETHER WE ARE STRONG
9129 2018-04-02 02:46:05 I have had a lot of DM's about price predictions. I want to clear a few things up. (1) No one really knows, I am just following TA rules (2) I am a long term #Holder, I do TA's because I love ya'll (3) We are a team!! lets work together! Tell me your market cap predictions 4 2018
9130 2018-04-02 02:45:53 Distributed governance as currently imagined in crypto appears to be anathema to enterprise value. Corp Governance mainly exists to maintain info/shareholder rights, something that is hard to peg in non-equity environments.
9131 2018-04-02 02:45:39 Bella, this makes sense. Thank you for explaining it!
9132 2018-04-02 02:45:34 IMO like-kind isn’t a good idea. It requires a ton of extra reporting and you don’t avoid the taxes by taking this position, you just defer them. Also the IRS already said that crypto doesn’t qualify in 2018, so I don’t see them being very likely to accept it in 2017 either
9133 2018-04-02 02:45:24 The problem I see with Crypto is that it is easily manipulated by 1. Price pumping by big fish. 2. Price volatility. 3. Government over-regulation. 4. Bankers can take over crypto buying in and leveraging resources IOT drive the little fish out.

9156 2018-04-02 02:41:57 thoughts. If we break up over the 7k regions it could signal a big move to wipe out the shorts that were getting stacked up to all time highs.

Most of feel this is not the end of the overall correction but a spike up here offers to wipe out the shorts then the longs back down

9165 2018-04-02 02:40:37 What does this even mean? Who the hell knows when it’s the top? 5 months ago? 10 years from now? If you believe in crypto you should be accumulating all the time.

9173 2018-04-02 02:39:35 Jonathan you have done a disservice to the crypto community in general when you spoke at parliament you are a division and a back stabber to the community, we need solidarity when presenting crypto to the government , you have lost a lot of respect from many not a good move

9175 2018-04-02 02:39:30 Thank you so much!! Unfortunately this coin is a new find for me so, atm I'm not a holder. I will however be following and doing updates and with the blessings of the crypto gods, I'll be hodling soon!!

Looking forward to your awesome innovations!
9176 2018-04-02 02:39:29 great project
9177 2018-04-02 02:39:25 Never
9178 2018-04-02 02:39:24 That's such bad advice.

If trading a male and female goat doesn't qualify for "Like-Kind" exchanges, then crypto to crypto won't.

9185 2018-04-02 02:38:09 This kind of irrationality in the marketplace makes me skeptical of the position. Crypto is a long way from mortgage investments and clearly they didn’t deserve the irrational valuation they received either.

9198 2018-04-02 02:36:16 LIFO is good for most people in 2017 because it reduces your tax bill, but it almost guarantees that you’ll never get long-term treatment on your gains, which is why I suggest FIFO as a long-term strategy
9199 2018-04-02 02:35:33 Not sure what the chances are unfortunately. But as of right now we don’t know which methods are acceptable so we are forced to choose and just have to hope that the IRS agrees. FIFO is most conservative so I don’t think you’d have issues there.

9205 2018-04-02 02:33:56 Remove the volume chart indicator. That’s a useless indicator to make an opinion. Why ? Because bitcoin doesn’t follow one exchange. And this indicator is based on one single exchange chart that you follow. That indicator is useless

9216 2018-04-02 02:31:43 في شركة تستخدم الcrypto currency وفكرتها ان تحول بدون رسوم.
عندك مبلغ؟ تحوله اونلاين الى كربـتو
بعدها ترسل المبلغ الطرف الآخر وهو بدوره يحوّله الى عملته.
تستغني حتى عن الرسوم البسيطة من شركات التحويل.

9218 2018-04-02 02:31:30 If crypto starts gaining traction again, its definitely possible 
9219 2018-04-02 02:31:16 You are doing yourself a big favor & you must appreciate your mental strength to hold temptations to jump into a fire. As you can see we aren’t buying yet. But may sell

If you can’t understand the value of Bitcoin and why we need it, your head is in the sand bro , pull it out b4 the tide comes in
9262 2018-04-02 02:23:49 @rogerkver a lot of people make fun of you these days but I appreciate what you have done for the crypto community over the years (no joke). What are the biggest problems in crypto and what are the solves? Is Hashgraph anything?

9270 2018-04-02 02:22:36 3-The edifice of crypto is to change that but that's where the problem starts. 4-there is no Satoshi Nakamoto and the principal supposed inventor is claiming patents on his alleged idea in England/australia (yes its about control again) thnk LIBOR/GOLDHOUSE scandal 2008
9271 2018-04-02 02:21:46 Worth watching indeed...sold all crypto and plan to buy again if btc gets unfer $4k

9288 2018-04-02 02:18:22 There are few factors that make everyone right & wrong when it comes 2 crypto 1-USPTO HAS DESIGNATED ~50k patents as state secret never will see lite of day. 2- runs on trade trade require some type of equity/collateral when not centralized & controlled causes problems
9289 2018-04-02 02:17:48 just goes to show that crypto is a weird and wonderful place. With the real partnership they've just secured, ledger nano etc. Ring CT... how on EARTH is that coin at $0.046.... 18% pump since larry and joe. If that happened in December $XVG would be at $1.50 by now

9306 2018-04-02 02:14:18 if Btc goes to $0 fiat, your telling me all of you crypto people are going to sell a coin at 0.0000600 btc how blind are you? If #bitcoin drops you should not be reducing the value of the alt coin or token. Your ratio to btc should be going up to stabilise alts fiat value.
9307 2018-04-02 02:14:00 I mean this from the depths of my belief in #Crypto and my I really want each of you to see your financial dreams realized

That dream must include @vergecurrency. $XVG is about to change the world, not just crypto. You're going to want to be a part of that. Diversify into XVG
9308 2018-04-02 02:13:52 We can all agree or disagree with John's opinions on #crypto but lets all take time to appreciate their beautiful love story.

9314 2018-04-02 02:13:13 Some of them are literally believing and RTing jokes about crypto

There seems to be an Arcadia ICO going around with an airdrop. Be careful of this one- no one in their team has any experience with Smart Contracts/coding or anything related to blockchain. Definitely a big red flag.

9320 2018-04-02 02:11:58 Bitcoin is a lot more scarce and it has an actual number in circulation. It’s way easier to manipulate the other markets because nobody knows what exists.

9333 2018-04-02 02:09:31 This is so great.  Not only is it necessary, but I love seeing vertcoin taking charge and attempting to start a movement within the crypto community for TRUE decentralization.  Awesome.
9334 2018-04-02 02:09:24 yes, a lot of everyday users of technology are apple users. I am a Windows PC and Android guy myself - but if we can co-exist in cryptospace while liking different coins, then we can all be friends between iOS and Android as well.

9350 2018-04-02 02:07:37 The only women deep in crypto space i have interacted with, I can count on one hand, so its hard for me to generalise what women are like or not like, just from that. 

I think the biggest thing i see are technical understanding barriers when people come from different fields

9401 2018-04-02 01:59:51 Vraiment ? Personnellement, je n’utiliserais jamais les bitcoins (la crypto-monnaie) pour payer quoi que ce soit ! Je partage le même avis que le ministre @CarlosJLeitao. La VRAIE monnaie, c’est celle émis par la Banque du Canada (@banqueducanada) !
9402 2018-04-02 01:59:48 Solution Crypto coins. Buy buy buy on exchange. Use half as currency. Hold other half till it’s a way of life as currency and reaches $M by everyone is using it. And Then sell and live the life .. BUT NEVER SELL NOW FOR PROFIT. it delays the process. Drum their heads captain
9403 2018-04-02 01:59:46 Me too man! I didn‘t sleep the last 3 days and all I‘m reading & hearing now is ‚reversal‘ & ‚breakout‘ 
If I‘m dreaming right now it‘s only because of @BigCheds & @ChartGuys  lucid dreaming video
9404 2018-04-02 01:59:41 Do they at least use a pun in their ads, something like: "Our crypto runs like bitcoin, only smoothier."
9405 2018-04-02 01:59:38 Domage que Mr Nadeau est mis autant d'ombre sur le sujet!! Les pauvres n'ont fait que ce défendre! Pcq pour ceux qui ne connaisse pas la crypto monnaie... n'ont rien compris!!

9406 2018-04-02 01:59:35 and 2 days later: RIP delusional dreamers
9407 2018-04-02 01:59:34 Is it an April Fools joke?  A few companies had self-named-crypto-currency pranks today.
9408 2018-04-02 01:58:32 I am really unwilling to design ordinary crypto challs like RSA with unsafe params or some other public-key crypto :P So, haha, there is no public-key crypto in 0ctf this year. (To be honest, I wonder if I could solve there three challs in two days if I were not the designer...)
9409 2018-04-02 01:58:25 Get rid of all the stinking administrators making more $ than the teachers and we’d be good. Isn’t it like crypto?? Decentralize it!  Cut the worthless layers out
9410 2018-04-02 01:57:30 #tlmep ...bitcoin, c'est où Bitfarms prend son argent pour payer pour la mine à Baie Commeau, si personne ne pait lors d'un échange transfert de leur crypto-monnaie.. ? On explique vraiment rien la dessus !
9411 2018-04-02 01:56:58 Indeed. Not every crypto company is a con. Companies like @Google are abusing their position and hurting crypto startups.

9413 2018-04-02 01:56:46 There will be more crypto/blockchain references in the next episodes? @SHO_Billions
9414 2018-04-02 01:56:14 Awesome thanks same for me i like binance maybe ill use in the future
9415 2018-04-02 01:56:13 That’s why everyone regardless of political ideology should embrace decentralized crypto currencies.

They take power from central corporations and put it back into the hands of the people... the token holders.

9418 2018-04-02 01:55:55 Close results but different paths to get there hahah. I'm not sure about it being a 1st wave with a truncated fifth and the c part of the ABC in your Y wave (yellow) seems to extend further than 1.618, suggesting an impulse rather than an ABC. Thoughts?

-Partnership announcement will be on 17th
-Reason for the delay is due to corporate timelines
-Sunerok's dedication and belief is very obvious
9425 2018-04-02 01:54:48 I forgot :)
9426 2018-04-02 01:54:26 Hence the calendar marking April 1 
9427 2018-04-02 01:54:25 It means that Easter is here
9428 2018-04-02 01:53:51 I love crypto twitter.  Bitcoin up 800% since last year and people acting like it's armageddon

9435 2018-04-02 01:52:46 I was worried about you. Glad to read this 
9436 2018-04-02 01:52:08 So @SocialBlade gives us our estimated Revenue in Crypto now? Sweet. I'm liking the new update. (Not Sarcasm)

9438 2018-04-02 01:52:00 Really appreciate & admire the hard work & dedication to crypto community and $LTC in particular done by ppl like @WildchildSings

9445 2018-04-02 01:49:20 Hey Brutha how did you buy? I’m trying to buy without going through coinbase and exchanging etc. I would like a direct route but my banks have banned crypto purchases
9446 2018-04-02 01:49:10 As for the crypto craze. GPU demand won't wain. The bearish analyst throwing out price targets over crypto are completely ignorant of what crypto is & how it is farmed. Ether is just 1 of a 100's of cryptocurrency. I can mine Monero & convert it to Ether.
9447 2018-04-02 01:48:36 Hey doing good. How are you??? Glad to see you back from the dark place...

9457 2018-04-02 01:46:37 Yes Exactly !!!  - This is why I laugh at anti-gun liberals like david hogg and friends who try to use "CHILDREN" as their excuse to attack guns - claiming they just want to save childrens lives - well if thats true then start with SHUTTING DOWN Planned Parenthood across America

9488 2018-04-02 01:42:15 Thank U! This isn’t my first rodeo! Hodl!(I am with all my positions). We won’t see under 4K-6k pet BTC. Crypto is Illegal in China. China is working on regulation. ~1.4 BILLION ppl live in China and many of them love crypto currency. It’s dead now. We will see growth, in time;)
9489 2018-04-02 01:42:10 Intuition as well. Women understand this. You create something that's intuitively easy to use and it can go viral. I actually advised one of my friends to look into crypto and now she's designing stuff for blockchain startups :) more women please!

Therefore, easier for an ave. Joe to make returns in Crypto than traditional markets  but making paper is never easy

9535 2018-04-02 01:34:33 I think right now this wave could be still part of the previous 4th wave, labeled in blue, part of an ABCDE correction.
9536 2018-04-02 01:34:27 I'm still pretty new to investing in crypto, but have been watching it for a while.  I'm not up to speed on the terms, but am trying to get the rest of it down.  Thanks for all your insight.
9537 2018-04-02 01:34:20 Better option would be selling to China, at 30% premium, gain access to entire Asia, already have access to US/Europe and live happily ever after. He may have lot of crypto to play with. Is that possible? Sell to China (Xi will accept even 100% premium)

9546 2018-04-02 01:33:03 lotta concerns with the technical viability of the crypto-market as well
btc isn't very viable as a digital currency, but as a digital financial device, it works well.
9547 2018-04-02 01:32:29 I don’t own any LTC yet. What if he had kept those LTC and tweeted about that failed litepay. Now people will say he shilled. So i think its a good decision for him to not own so he can tweet his excitement at his own will.

9552 2018-04-02 01:31:30 I think it's Google manipulating the search suggestions to fit the mainstream narrative. They did the same thing during the presidential election.

9565 2018-04-02 01:29:56 TA also requires risk management to be successful. Totally different scenario to being an “investor / taking a punt”.

Crypto follows normal economic forces (Demand & Supply), the demand however is considered speculative. TA works well in this scenario with short term data.

9667 2018-04-02 01:11:39 I complain a lot about the crypto maximalists on Twitter that don’t understand laws and regulations. But anti-crypto Twitter isn’t much better. 1/2
9668 2018-04-02 01:11:38 Yeah,thanks. Tweet deleted.
9669 2018-04-02 01:11:35 honestly, i didn't see this count. I really like it, but i think we've already bottomed out. i also see a 1:1 extension of the a wave to the c wave here already hit.

9684 2018-04-02 01:09:34 #2017 recorded 902 ICOs. 
418 failed (scam or run away with the money) which makes up 46.34% .
114 stalled and will likely failed which makes up 12.64%

So far 58.9% of last year #ICOs have hit the dead end.

This is the proof that #bitcoin and all #crypto are #scam!
9685 2018-04-02 01:09:31 why would you assume that the 5 wave goes down so far? most likely is a 1:1 extension of the 1st wave measured from the 4th right?

9696 2018-04-02 01:07:55 #courttime. Associations interested in #blockchain and #cryptos from #Russia, #China, #SouthKorea met in #Moscow to file a class action paper against Yandex, Facebook, Google, Twitter in a #US court. Why? Because these coys banned crypto ads. Hard truth: Class action looks DoA.
9697 2018-04-02 01:07:50 Are you out of the crypto now?
9698 2018-04-02 01:07:47 the $crypto community should be more supportive of twitter. You can complain when times are bad (all the spam we had earlier) but you should also commend them when they're doing a good job like they are now.
9699 2018-04-02 01:07:45 They're trained well.
9700 2018-04-02 01:07:28 I can understand that. Luckily in Australia we are allowed to spend crypto in small amounts for personal use

9705 2018-04-02 01:06:36 Hence why Monero remains a crypto for strong privacy and fungibility use cases.

Trust people? They shouldn't trust anyone. Crypto should remain trustless and free of personalities. Roger is a supporter who has thrown his weight behind bch. Anyone can do this... Free market.

9707 2018-04-02 01:06:17 It usually does work but in crypto it's manipulated too much. Today at around 910am Pacific we had a 400 dollar green 15min candlestick out of nowhere in the middle of a range with no support and bearish indicators. Things like that effect ta's usefulness

9732 2018-04-02 01:02:27 Plus, I think the big difference everyone keeps missing is that, unlike the stock market, crypto is unregulated. So it's not a good comparison to the stock market.

9792 2018-04-02 00:54:30 if one were seriously concerned about IQ or intelligence, there are myriad proven ways to raise IQ: educational intervention, lead paint removal, desegregating the schools. and the topic wouldn't be the nearly exclusive domain of racists and crypto-eugenicists.

9809 2018-04-02 00:50:54 Is there something fundamentally different about the way women build businesses from the way men build businesses? Every businessman I know prefers no middlemen. I'm trying to understand what a woman specifically brings to crypto that a man simply doesn't or can't.
9810 2018-04-02 00:50:47 going to be a good week in crypto...i can feel it
9811 2018-04-02 00:50:45 No one is talking bout this for some  reason.  I think we would hear more if the pros thought it was likely.
9812 2018-04-02 00:50:34 I will thanks!!! Would never put my money into a pajama boy coin!!!! Id rather lose every dime than waste my time with a sh!t coin such as xvg
9813 2018-04-02 00:50:30 @SatoshiLite no blame for what you did. Could have been the head of any Crypto project + sold at that time; 90% chance it would've been ATH for that coin too. I'd say you got lucky for selling at the ATH but really it would have been better to make profit + see it go higher...

9831 2018-04-02 00:47:51 H&S is one of the favorite crypto patterns. As one good trader said:  
An H&S pattern is a process through which strong hands (in from much lower) distribute their ownership to weak hands (latecomers).

9922 2018-04-02 00:34:09 'Blockchain social' will be the next bullish-engulfing search-candle -- err, query -- to overtake 'big data machine learning AI'.  Drawn along a relatively short timeline, Skynet as victor is eventual result of both, mwuahaha.   ;)

9924 2018-04-02 00:34:04 Sec doesn’t have to approve the smart contract. All he is doing is registering the crypto as a security with applicable regs for investors whitelist screening and pre-registration. So he is using crypto to have ico instead of Ipo cause it’s cheaper and faster
9925 2018-04-02 00:34:03 I think so, why?

9927 2018-04-02 00:33:53 absolutely! my trolls love to be sideline commentators n critique from the sidelines but never do anything to contribute value to the crypto community!  absolutely ur right.
9928 2018-04-02 00:33:47 一乗寺じゃ駄目なん？
9929 2018-04-02 00:33:44 Yup it is, but crypto has nothing to do with the bitcoin bubble. Crypto (blockchain) is just the method, not the value.

I will go back my "military shit" now.
9930 2018-04-02 00:33:34 have you got a link to @Rev_Nissan steemit post?
9931 2018-04-02 00:33:18 great to hear the church has been accepting crypto now, really forward thinking of them

9935 2018-04-02 00:32:47 Do it. Best decision I've ever made.
9936 2018-04-02 00:32:41 Ever heard of gemini exchange?
9937 2018-04-02 00:32:31 Everything n everyone gets called a scam in crypto... tell me something original i haven't heard in the last 5 yrs.... u need to tell ur twitter bot programmer to start using a newer set of vocabulary bro cuz u n all my other twitter bot trolls sound exactly the same. troll on!
9938 2018-04-02 00:32:17 Yes, 54% of crypto market cap doesn't need to exist.  However, there is that limited use case in which censorship resistance is actually a desired feature, and that currently accounts for 46% of crypto market cap.
9939 2018-04-02 00:32:15 Just for info, the machine behind is the ancester of a PBX ( private branch exchange) 
Thats how communications worked, you literally needed a human to connect you.
Next generation was IP PBX. 
9940 2018-04-02 00:31:56 I think $VEN is about ready for a solid 30-50% increase real soon...
9941 2018-04-02 00:31:18 Do you run their group or just a member?
9942 2018-04-02 00:31:11 Do you think we hit bottom?
9943 2018-04-02 00:31:08 店長がナヨナヨタイプのとこで副店長してて、楽しく仕切ってたんだけど、異動で女王様タイプの店長が私の店舗配属になって、いきなり肩身狭くなったの。名指しで連絡ノートにボロクソ書かれたから腹立って階段の所でボコボコにした (イキり自慢みたいだったらごめんね) 今考えると恥ずかしい社会人だ

9961 2018-04-02 00:28:39 Yes, masochism. If you cannot find a way to enjoy the lows that are inevitable, stay away. Right, these lows are not low enough for me. Still waiting on BTC to hit 3500. Best go back to flagellation until the wick's are licking the bottom. #bringthepain
9962 2018-04-02 00:28:36 Adoption rate of $crypto or $btc is around 2-5%. What percentage of #nocoiners do you believe are on the sidelines waiting for another bull run to get in?
9963 2018-04-02 00:28:30 Let's see a Dapps working first but I don't see Bitcoin as something else than a crypto reserve currency and crypto store of value and I don't think it will ever find an other use. Of course it will be like this weird old stuff, the question is whether pure gold or pure scrap ?

Nowadays if u haven't cracked 8-9 figures yet, I'm probably not gonna listen to ya.

9984 2018-04-02 00:24:50 U proved urself wrong with 1K price target. How on earth can it go to 1K when the mining cost is like 4-4.5K? People won’t mine or u think they will mine at a loss, which no1 will. You discredit your whole cartel explanation sorry.
9985 2018-04-02 00:24:50 えww
驚きしかないww
9986 2018-04-02 00:24:38 Suppose that crypto currencies live up to their promise and serve as a generally accepted medium of exchange for common goods and services. What does that have to do with the amount of dollars (exchange rate) you can trade cryptos for?

9988 2018-04-02 00:24:07 OH no 1April, You can never Leave Crypto!!!
9989 2018-04-02 00:23:56 And that's why I moved out west. Snow can suck it.
9990 2018-04-02 00:23:54 Price of bitcoin is currently £4831 

I reckon the price of bitcoin is falling is because people are selling bitcoin to diversity their crypto portfolio by using bitcoin profits to buy a variety of other crypto coins at very cheap prices which will give them a balanced portfolio
9991 2018-04-02 00:23:46 
9992 2018-04-02 00:23:45 The person that "wins" or picks the mega ball. How do you know that person is real? Let's say 100 people give me money and I pick one person to win. The person I choose might be myself, a different account with fake name.
9993 2018-04-02 00:23:29 Saw this like a week ago and found it to be funny for him....he hates to use his own money for investment and always tried to find an easy royalty or loan deal. This essentially is the same but just hype attached w crypto/blockchain. Digitizing assets has been a goal for a few
9994 2018-04-02 00:23:25 @SatoshiLite
Crypto Markets will always be Bi-polar, as long as there is a cycle of generations to support, it's the bear necessaries of being in the crypto life.
In other words, whipping off all the shit coins before putting on some new slacks.

9998 2018-04-02 00:22:22 You’re a wise man! Words of wisdom!!!most people are delusional and invest without even realizing or really  thinking about what they buy into! Then it’s doesnt go up 10% in 4 hours and they panic and sell when it does the normal dip! Crypto isnt a casino! Patience is a virtue

10003 2018-04-02 00:20:57 We had more volume when that happened too. How orchestrated does something have to look before you guys start seeing the massive sell off. Did you guys think professional wrestling was real back in the day too?
10004 2018-04-02 00:20:43 All the interesting $crypto conversations happen right as you’re just getting in bed. Every time. Then you can’t put your phone down until you actively force yourself to. Bloody time zones.
10005 2018-04-02 00:20:36 Although when I first started learning crypto it was like being air dropped into a foreign country.  This is a good question and one I learned to figure out from you Michael Suppo.
10006 2018-04-02 00:20:32 I disagree cordially. I was given almost a half $LTC over two months. It encouraged me to start a wallet for someone by donating their first bit of #crypto.I have since given ALL of what I received back and sparked the interest of new people, expanding our community #LitecoinFam
