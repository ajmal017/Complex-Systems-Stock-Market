0 2018-06-23 23:59:50 Nah not really, all I know is that crypto is something concealed. I'm very much open to learning something new if you don't mind
1 2018-06-23 23:59:39 This is the truth: "For every stupid dollar that leaves the total crypto market cap, there’s a smart dollar that enters" 

Make sure to be on the good side...

People came into #Crypto last year to get rich quick. Most have now exited at a 50% loss and will be buying back in when its too late, again.

6 2018-06-23 23:57:27 10% Tax on Crypto Grains is Fake News Taxation has been a hot topic in the cryptocurrency world this year.
7 2018-06-23 23:56:51 Where do you get your confidence? I've been buying XRP since last July (.18-.26). And it's my biggest bag by far. But I'm not as confident as you even though I think it's the best crypto by a mile.
8 2018-06-23 23:56:42 Imagine a future where @NASA can create its own crypto currency so it’s investors can support NASA and earn rewards from new technologies birthed from the space program and help it reach new heights in the future. Win win in my book :)
9 2018-06-23 23:55:50 Well said homie
10 2018-06-23 23:55:48 Stop comparing $BTC to $gold.

11 2018-06-23 23:54:21 So...at today’s rate you invest 50,000 on ONT for a chance to earn 15K a year on something that may or may not exist 5 years from now. Seems way to risky. Dividends are great but they are icing on the cake (whether stocks or crypto).
12 2018-06-23 23:54:04 So, what coins do you actually use? Aside from holding, or trading, are there any coins that you find have actual utility?

I use SiaCoin and already have contracts created for 3 TB of hard drive space in the cloud. What a cool project!!!

13 2018-06-24 23:59:08 They straight up tell you none of the funds are going into platform development. All that money to create ConsenSys on crack for a late to the game crypto.
14 2018-06-24 23:58:53 When you clock back in can you explain to me what you look for in a BP? I voted based upon the simplicity of voting tools and experience in the crypto-space. I've used Bancor for awhile now and LiquidEOS had a user-friendly portal. Am i doing it wong?
15 2018-06-24 23:58:38 People actually believe RIPPLE will replace the dollar.
16 2018-06-24 23:57:42 $met auction ended at 0.002781 ETH. It may list on IDEX soon. As usual, the price will be pumped by a few groups and noobs will fomo. If you are really into this project, wait for 2-3 weeks. Buy cheap from weak hands
17 2018-06-24 23:57:29 The absolute state of retardation.
18 2018-06-24 23:57:09 John has the libertarian and crypto universe behind him.  They should be afraid.
19 2018-06-24 23:56:54 He did great not to state the obvious reasons 
20 2018-06-24 23:56:46 Hook a brother up?
21 2018-06-24 23:55:53 I understand. I just see it dropping if $BTC does so I set some buy orders just in case
22 2018-06-24 23:55:43 For All who says BTC is going to 3k! Short it on @BitMEXdotcom 100x risk and take a screenshot for us.. put your money where your mouth is or shut up!

27 2018-06-24 23:54:49 I'd prefer it if ICX dropped after pumping at least 10% first so I can get out unscathed. Otherwise it'll be another stop loss triggered.
28 2018-06-24 23:54:37 While investing in stocks, I never really believed in Technical Analysis. Used to only do Fundamental Analysis. 

But crypto has made me realize the importance of TA. It works more often than not.
29 2018-06-24 23:54:36 Oui en effet je réfléchissais à mettre un "coefficient de difficulté" à chaque take-profit mais le soucis c'est que tu rentres dans ton sentiment et ta subjectivité pour calculer cela. 
Juste mettre X fois le risque avec X ton nombre de take-profit me semble trop radical

34 2018-06-22 23:59:17 Gold is a buy now, I think.
35 2018-06-22 23:59:14 $hot - When this whole crypto thing is mainstream, Holochain will be massive.

$pcn - Not rekt, just super early. IMO the next privacy bull. Solid in all aspects.

$dgb - One day everyone will marvel at this bad boy.

$eca - Huge community. Will be dropping a lot of news soon.
36 2018-06-22 23:59:12 I have my share of downtime online with my crypto being number 1, conspiracy theories bein second but more importantly I spend most of my time learning how to better relationships between the black man and black woman.
37 2018-06-22 23:58:54 @rados_io Looking forward to tomorrow and trying out the exchange! ill be making a video on it as soon as I can! As someone thats investing in @eth_classic for the long term. This exchange is great news for me! $ETC $ETH $BTC #altcoin #crypto
38 2018-06-22 23:58:41 It's ok I didn't realise you were discontinuing the neo pairings. I couldn't place any orders. Bad move since neo can be withdrawn with no fees
39 2018-06-22 23:58:41 You’re absolutely right I didn’t mean it like that. I meant the overall upward move will start going up but not with one green candle stick. My bad

43 2018-06-22 23:57:53 I gotta say as a crypto newbie, watching you whales/vets panic sell during a bear market is a little embarrassing.
