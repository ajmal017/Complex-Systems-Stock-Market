1 2018-06-19 23:59:42 Olive oil and butter. Interesting combo. I don’t hate it
2 2018-06-19 23:59:15 Too bad trump foundation money was used for legal settlements, trump oil painting, football helmet, etc.  He could have used that money instead of taxpayer dollars since he lied about getting Mexico to pay for it.
3 2018-06-19 23:59:06 Thank you! I’m just trying to tackle scarring atm I use bio oil like 4 times a week, if I use it anymore I break out send me the face scrub please! I’ll try it out!xx

5 2018-06-19 23:58:56 Do u use argan oil at all? I find its really useful for frizz!!
6 2018-06-19 23:58:55 Time to think about not going to the USA. For any reason. Let the Americans stay at home as are a the  a. holes who support trump. Cut off all hydro to the usa and oil. Steel and any thing the USA needs from us. We don't need them in the long term.
7 2018-06-19 23:58:41 Krissy just told me she got her last oil change on my birthday, January 25th cause she forgot about it. I don’t know what’s worse, she can’t adult very well or my best friend doesn’t know my birthday 
8 2018-06-19 23:58:28 Double standard. You use oil and gas in your cars. You use oil based products. Spare me your hypocritical platitudes.
9 2018-06-19 23:58:17 By their own numbers " As of the second quarter of 2016, the ED’s outstanding loans totaled $986.19 billion."

The best case scenario is the GDP "increase" barely covers the immediate cost of this hare-brained scheme.

36 2018-06-19 23:57:01 It’s pretty much trial and error. It took me a minute to find what worked and I still got some tears every morning. (Me, not Nikki LOL) Oil based products work well, olive oil, satin pillowcases, headbands. Hell, try it all. You’re bound to find what works for your baby girl.

42 2018-06-19 23:56:26 argan oil is the best thing that’s ever happened 2 my skin
43 2018-06-19 23:56:22 I put a bit of olive oil and butter on a pan place the bread on it for a min or so on med heat, place butter and oil on top of bread flip it over. Place American and maybe Colby jack cheese on that. Do same for other piece of bread. Place together, cut in half.
44 2018-06-19 23:56:09 We've been kept out of the oil sands and pipeline industry until recently..

Now, foreign interests want to take away the jobs we had to fight for.
45 2018-06-19 23:55:37 Northern MN is pro Trump.  They want mining & drilling near the Boundary Waters for the jobs.  The contract is for a Chinese company, doubt it will use American steel.  And the vote to replace oil line 3 that runs thru the Mississippi Head waters & Ojibwe land is up for vote now.
46 2018-06-19 23:55:35 She is obviously alarmed and heads straight to the nearest @Kia dealership which was @southlake_kia. That's also the one she already always gets her oil changes and maintenance at. So she isn't a stranger there neither is #kiaoptimus. That is what she named her car.  I know
47 2018-06-19 23:55:34 No it didn't. Of all things I filled it up with oil and boosted it, the next day, and it fired right up. Sounded good for about 10 minutes. Then it sounded really bad. I never lost oil pressure so I think I took out a wrist pin. Drove it up to the barn and backed it in.  Lucky
48 2018-06-19 23:55:30 I like it with a bit of crème fraîche and herbs, or just a bit of olive oil  never tried mayo with cucumber, I think I miss something
49 2018-06-19 23:55:28 Oh crap, Trump just realised we have oil (he called it energy)... next he’ll start saying we are a threat to their national security (crap that happened too!) and suggest that Trudeau needs to be overthrown... before you know it the USA will be “liberating” us. “For freedom!”

51 2018-06-19 23:54:46 Trend cta enter/exits are gradual these days.  In unit terms: 4-3-2-1-0 / 1-2-3-4 vs. 4-0 0-4.  Tougher to game moves and they’re less concentrated. Likely 3 in oil and 1 nowhere near.  They matter only when combined with other populations.
52 2018-06-19 23:54:24 I swear to god that it does not take 3 fucking hours to change my oil dude.
53 2018-06-19 23:54:13 Just keep the runoff on your property & out of storm sewers & you will be fine. In HHI, storm sewers feed directly into lagoon system, so gotta be careful. We use an oil sock or a shop vac.
54 2018-06-19 23:53:54 And they say the squeaky wheel gets the oil.

56 2018-06-19 23:53:23 Lmao as If the USA is not a mass murderer,  oil oriented intruder, who slaves immigrant kids, and allows the murder of their own kids because it can get over a ancient law, kills minorities, supports racist officers and misogyny in the form of an orange clown.
57 2018-06-19 23:53:21 youre literally ruining lives of people outside america for shit like oil... americans blamed a whole terrorist attack on us muslims...you are the most anti black and immigrant country, your country slaughtered people to steal their land and celebrate it today "thanksgiving"-
58 2018-06-19 23:52:55 Your president is perpetuating a humanitarian crisis, Susan. I wonder if you would have told German non-citizens that their opinion didn’t matter on the imprisonment and murder of families and children during the Holocaust?

67 2018-06-19 23:52:24 > my eyes fell shut. The hall just outside the door was now completely silent, even if there were others still working, burning the midnight oil. This place never fully slept, and perhaps that’s why no one stood up to, @MurderousWrath and his crew. No one would be able to >
68 2018-06-19 23:51:44 No Bill, Shell was just declared the largest oil corporation on Planet Earth and the 11th largest company by market cap.

73 2018-06-19 23:51:03 Oil prices are DOWN 4%. Today, I was running!
74 2018-06-19 23:50:59 Probably not.  She's the one that ALWAYS said hi and I'm 99 percent sure the coconut oil was from her.
75 2018-06-19 23:50:54 Yes, The ones who don't kowtow to him scare him. 
That's why he had to take on Mark Sanford. That's the headline.

If he takes on Laura Bush, i wouldn't be shocked as much as i'd be disgusted (as always)

77 2018-06-19 23:50:42 Was gonna go back to Charlotte tomorrow but I’ll just wait until Wednesday, i need an oil change 
78 2018-06-19 23:50:42 No way it's going into a bank in the US. Mexico needs this money. I have read it's one of the top (the top) income generator for the economy. Greater than tourism, agriculture, oil exports. What happens to Mex economy if we stop illegal immigration and $ to Mex? They're toast!
79 2018-06-19 23:50:24 Where is the outrage over countries and leaders that are allowing their citizens to leave? Stop sending taxpayer $ to these countries. American $ sent by illegals back so why do they care...Mexico's #2 revenue after oil. If we continue allowing this no one left in South America.

83 2018-06-19 23:50:06 The total subsidies that were given to the oil industry by the canadian government overtime could have been used to ease taxes or improve the lives of canadians instead of enriching the few.

91 2018-06-19 23:49:02 Yeah, if that news gets out. Maybe Fox will cover but surely as I breathe the media complex will ignore it.
92 2018-06-19 23:48:53 Y’all be posting on SC that you got a full tank but have ur check engine, battery, oil & every other warning light on 
93 2018-06-19 23:48:46 What is your problem, he's just a guy looking for a job and he happens to come from Cyprus. Is it any worse than a Scot moving to Angola for the oil industry or similar, or is that Scot denying an Angolan a job?
94 2018-06-19 23:48:44 Buy signal  one last drop?  I remember $INTC $MSFT in and $CVX got booted. Then oil went to $120
95 2018-06-19 23:48:36 How to identify a Democrat...

1) Dems can’t speak w/o insulting those who disagree w/them. 

2)Dems condemn violence while hiring protesters to  attack others

3)Dems accuse others of racism but expect all women, Latinos to vote the same

4)Dems actually listen to Nancy Pelosi
96 2018-06-19 23:48:10 I just need a can of oil once and a while to stop the limbs from squeaking #RoboDad
97 2018-06-19 23:48:06 not low oil prices that has deterred investment.   you know AB can prod more oil than can be taken away.   When o/g pls& tanker cars r full, extra barrels given away,basic s/d & econ 101.  Libs killed huge energy projects worth $100B +. Ndp took bludgeoning & sacrifice, BIGcost.
98 2018-06-19 23:47:56 Tonight's dinner involved a symphony of lipids: olive oil for the burned broccoli, pork fat to sear off the pork chops, and a half stick of butter with oregano and garlic for the rigatoni.

There was also a baguette and a bottle of white involved.

I regret nothing.

103 2018-06-19 23:47:25 Oh, Sweet Jesus. 

You do know Mueller's investigation isn't like an episode of Law & Order, right? The fact that the proof hasn't yet been publicized doesn't mean he doesn't have it.

Lifting sanctions on Russian oil companies & changing the GOP platform at the convention are 2.

110 2018-06-19 23:46:21 It is surprising walls, fences, are considered highly effective everywhere they are used, except on the border. There, they are ineffectual and a waste of money. Amazing
111 2018-06-19 23:46:20 when you increase rates the value goes up.  The 10 year US yeild is going up. That is why the USD is going up. If the BOC  increases rates with the FED it will also go up.  Oil doesn't really matter. Especially since the major drop in oil is far behind us.
112 2018-06-19 23:46:08 Try castor oil, hair oil, or lower wages.
113 2018-06-19 23:45:42 I'm painting digitally! Similar to oil paints in a way except I dont have the mess haha

115 2018-06-19 23:45:05 And you leave out the worst Human rights abuser....British govt. From SLAVERY to GENOCIDE to continued GENOCIDE till date of Hebrew Biafra in Nigeria to steal oil. Voted against 0. When TRUTH is the Standard, Evil will run.

119 2018-06-19 23:44:44 I use olive oil when I pan-fry seafood and butter anytime I use a flame...that sounds yummy though!

122 2018-06-19 23:44:39 Visit some muslim restaurants in India. They have banners asking Muslims to stop buying Yehudi products. They wont serve Coke or Pepsi, but Big Cola. Why do u hate the Jews so much? Didn't their engineers help you build systems to extract oil. Varna Arabs ko ghanta malum hota
123 2018-06-19 23:44:39 Yes girl. By the grace of God. currently getting my feet done w my oil change money lol
124 2018-06-19 23:44:37 huh? I think you have a few things confused.  Its called a commodity currency the CAD and the AUD. But that has nothing to do with value as the BOC can manipulate the value of the CAD buy increasing rates. That is how it works. Has very little to do with oil.
125 2018-06-19 23:44:36 How else do you propose we save our planet sir? No, really?! What are your suggestions for changing our entire economy from oil and gas based to renewable energy? Or are you hoping God will save us from extinction?
126 2018-06-19 23:44:22 went to get my oil changed and the guy asked where my mom was so she could sign for the car
127 2018-06-19 23:44:00 John D. Rockefeller was the wealthiest businessman in the history of America and the world. His net worth was $400bn. He was the founder of Standard Oil. 
Not even Jeff Bezos of Amazon or Bill Gate of Microsoft can close to his net worth.

131 2018-06-19 23:43:16 I can describe what over 500 witnesses saw at one time. I can describe what the apostles all witnessed and died over rather than deny Christ's Resurrection truth. Only John survived on Patmos as an exile after they tried to kill him in a vat of hot oil. What would you die for?
132 2018-06-19 23:43:13 He said it’s “helping hands” because he was on an oil rig and his son was in VA with a broken computer
I said if I had $100 it would be to help myself...he said that isn’t much money
133 2018-06-19 23:43:07 Like oil and water listening to you guys and that bunch of imbeciles giggling away like the class dullards. Keep standing up for Scotland. 
134 2018-06-19 23:43:07 omg see i was using that and like in the past it’s worked so well and i bought the cherry one on sunday and it’s just not working???? i’ve been switching between that and tea tree oil tho, gonna see how it goes, ty boo xo
135 2018-06-19 23:43:04 My son has been using nouns as verbs (oaring: using an oar in a boat & pastelling: using oil pastels to color with). I think he's got a future in advertising!

142 2018-06-19 23:41:58 Not a doubt in my mind. Group B is matched up with them next round and whoever plays them will be down 1-0 before the game begins....a gift to Putin. We've seen this corruption before from FIFA many times. (eg.SKorea 2002)
143 2018-06-19 23:41:52 I’m also 155 pounds, and physically healthy unlike the woman in said picture so I can afford to do some dumb shit like drink oil, and I’m at least acknowledging it wasn’t a good idea, unlike you acknowledging that being that big is unhealthy. I got time today
144 2018-06-19 23:41:44 The Problem with these Politicians is that President Trump made Obama,Bush and Clinton look like the Fools they are. It wasn't they couldn't do anything , it is the fact they didn't want to ..The Big Oil Bush Family used the office to protect his big money in his bank account.
145 2018-06-19 23:41:43 An oil change is like a 30 minute process I should not still be here :-)
146 2018-06-19 23:41:43 you have to eyeball it a bit, but white wine, garlic, S&P, and oil, pretty simple if you're in a hurry
147 2018-06-19 23:41:38 Nice! I know Red Lion has said that “it’s not about putting as much C60 as possible in the oil..” but it kind of is, if you want to limit how much oil you consume. Going to research this some more.
148 2018-06-19 23:41:37 So beard oil is not for helping your beard to connect... huh.. the more you know

150 2018-06-19 23:41:11 Sure, Cameron. I’m sure they have more important things to worry about than blatant racism. Things like having their land used without consent to transport oil or the oppression that comes with being second class citizens or maybe the lack of justice against their raped women.

160 2018-06-19 23:40:10 It’s time to forget party lines! 45 would fry them all in hot oil if they disagree in a second to get what he wants. Gutless GOP!  I’m thinking of buying 400 sets of testicles from a pig slaughter house and delivering them to each of their offices!! #cleanhouse

173 2018-06-19 23:37:53 Tonight i made a vegan soup, made of coconut oil, garlic, onions, brocoili, an apple and some spinach.

Cooked it for awhile, blended it - ugh - turned out so good
174 2018-06-19 23:37:45 Sometimes when I say oil it comes out like ole but at least I don’t pronounce flour like floyer
175 2018-06-19 23:37:44 Saudi Arabia suffered after the oil cut off from the West in support of Egypt, Syria and it suffered from its support for Iraq against Iran and suffered after its liberation from Kuwait and is now suffering because of the liberation of Yemen.
176 2018-06-19 23:37:37 Americans for Prosperity, is financed by the oil billionaires Charles G. and David H. Koch to advance conservative causes.
177 2018-06-19 23:36:56 The BEST part is uncovering an artifact & figuring out what you found. I've had lots of interesting finds, but when I excavated in Pompeii years ago I found an intact oil lamp that is my fav find so far. It's not very important, but it's special to me.
178 2018-06-19 23:36:56 They're probably gonna be in prison for a while.. so yeah

180 2018-06-19 23:36:40 What did I say last week about Russia. That side is god awful and yet they keep scoring a ton of goals. Something smells but not surprised in the least.
181 2018-06-19 23:36:12 BREAKING: Trump just eliminated the bipartisan National Ocean Policy--a blow to restoring the healthy & productivity of America’s oceans & Great Lakes. Coastal states and economies will bear the cost, & guess who gains? Oil and gas. #ProtectOurCoast

184 2018-06-19 23:36:04 I'm a Nelson supporter. Scott is anti environment. Just had gas and oil throw a fundraiser for him in Tx. I'm thinking off shore drilling.
185 2018-06-19 23:36:01 Actually, I like NG vehicles because they allow renewable electricity to displace oil. Gas is merely the intermediary for net displacement. Batteries work too in a more direct way.
186 2018-06-19 23:35:58 Every other subject is nill. Very few prizes for knowledge in the whole Muslim world in the last Century.

196 2018-06-19 23:34:25 Well not surprising bc Biore cleansing oil dah lama di market before double cleansing is a thing. Ada baca di FB, kakak ni pakai since tahun bila ntah tapi dah berbelas tahun la.

201 2018-06-19 23:33:44 Studies do not support your number, there is walls in some areas already.  With what a wall would cost there is hundreds of other solutions out there I believe, including hiring more agents.

202 2018-06-19 23:33:41 @Joesus_Christ I wonder if Carson would think it weird if I asked for his shirt so I could wring it out and collect the sweat then use it as eye drops or anointing oil before every Eagles game I watch... or maybe I could like put it in a vial and wear it around my neck 
203 2018-06-19 23:33:33 Well I doubt she shotguns vegetable oil so maybe you should re-evaluate the way you live your life
204 2018-06-19 23:33:28 I was so excited to have wings, which I thought they smelled weird, I figured it was just the oil they were cooked in... its was ducking dry rub  I’m livid

208 2018-06-19 23:32:31 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
209 2018-06-19 23:32:22 i think he genuinely doesn’t understand he’s being anti semitic. he’s a grifter but he buys his own snake oil.
210 2018-06-19 23:32:14 No wonder our oil prices can't come down even when the world prices are down they hve been wasting away our money like wow
211 2018-06-19 23:32:13 Well of course. Obviously highly processed, fatty, packaged food full of refined sugar, oil, and preservatives isn’t healthy. Ornish was pretty on with his macro ratios though! That is why Whole Foods Plant based (low fat,  high carb) diet is so healthy...

222 2018-06-19 23:31:04 I think some still think the Iraq war was a form of human rights abuse, since it was basically about oil profits.
223 2018-06-19 23:31:00 This is proof @laurawbush is a hypocrite and a fraud- got absolutely nothing for a family that sets forth to kill Americans to make a few bucks off of foreign oil fields concerning Halliburton and thier lackey @DickCheney
224 2018-06-19 23:30:52 I got my hand crushed between a tow motor and oil tote at work this morning. After x-rays the doc said it’s not broke but severely sprained and contused. I’m like 99% sure it didn’t break bc of all the milk I drink.
225 2018-06-19 23:30:46 Blend 1 pound crab with 4 cups cheddar. Mix into  Olive Oil. Squeeze out excess liquid Serve to your worst enemy.
226 2018-06-19 23:30:44 We do it all the time... and with oils too! Herbs and plants have natural healing and animals chose ones they need. I have been using a lot of frankincense oil recently!

228 2018-06-19 23:30:31 50.00 for an oil change .. I didn’t ask for all that fancy shit but I’m not gunna argue cuz I’m tired lol
229 2018-06-19 23:30:29 More simpler when sponsors were from the Oil, Tobacco, Garage and Beer industries.
230 2018-06-19 23:30:20 @fordnation why don't you create a provincially owned gas company and regulate the prices there? Big oil will match the prices.  Same goes for cell service. Start a provincially owned company to provide reasonably priced services.
231 2018-06-19 23:30:02 Wa Wa!!   It’s clear you and your democrat colleagues do not have a problem with people breaking the laws of the United States of America!!  That’s the sad part.

234 2018-06-19 23:29:37 Get a bigger pan or cook in batches. Also... Where is the oil? 
235 2018-06-19 23:29:36 Stay unified. Regardless of what you think of him, it’s ours to lose. Let’s not tur on @AndrewScheer like they turned on @stephenharper and now we have this chaos ruling our nation: 
1) open borders
2) gender based trade negotiations 
3) dangerous deficit 
4) failed oil pipeline
236 2018-06-19 23:29:15 Also how the oil was running out here in Aberdeen,2014 was a memorable year.for Unionists lies.
2018 same they lied to the fisheries and farmers.Suddenly that disappearing Oil is back funny that eh?I wonder where they hide all that black stuff.

239 2018-06-19 23:28:18 That's not sweat. It's more like baby oil. All those dudes probably all have stock in Johnson & Johnson haha
240 2018-06-19 23:28:16 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!
241 2018-06-19 23:27:28 What's the fuckin point of that? Obviously the bent/hot oil money from Saudi Arabia, but, that fight should be in a football stadium in the UK. Boxing never fails to cock things right up.
242 2018-06-19 23:27:26 Not oil baron aesthetic!!
243 2018-06-19 23:27:16 There are many factors that contribute to the increasing oil prices, one main factor is the increasing OIL prices since 2016 gllobally!! and adding to that is the increasing value of US dollar globally.. so dont blame this surge of prices on TRAIN only!
244 2018-06-19 23:27:06 Big oil loves the Saudis. No one talks about them slaughtering the people of Yemen... I’ve been to Iran, and everything you think is true about Iran, is ACTUALLY true about Saudi Arabia. Salman just legalized women driving... such liberals! LOL.
245 2018-06-19 23:26:58 Also if you have a CDL or don't mind working at an oil rig look into moving to Midland Texas.
246 2018-06-19 23:26:39 I'm a loud masturbater. Cute female neighbor on the shared wall would always blush when I saw her, but would say hi.
Was phone fucking a long distance friend and complained the lotion i was using sucked.  2 day later a gift bag with bottle of coconut oil was outside my door.

248 2018-06-19 23:26:25 I do think prison time is harmful for minor offenses. I prefer whipping or caning, as it seems likely to be an effective deterrent but much more humane. Far less likely to ruin the life of the one so punished.
249 2018-06-19 23:26:08 Because the evil Koch brothers make $$$ off oil.  We used to have the red line here when my mom was little.  They took it all out which was the dumbest idea ever.
250 2018-06-19 23:26:05 @khadijabasmaa is one of the sweetest people I ever knew . Although I didn't know her much. But I m sure each person talking about her badly... Deserves to be fried in hot oil, then burned in a large container of acid. Then , idk, watch Hannibal . :D what's wrong with the world.
251 2018-06-19 23:25:59 It's a very good start and example for all countries, except Norway exports oil for others to use.

254 2018-06-19 23:25:44 I really don't get where 45 was trying to go with this.  Is he saying that Canadians shouldn't buy American shoes (& presumably other goods)?  Is he decrying tariffs?

He complains about Canadian oil coming in; is he against the Keystone XL pipeline now?

What a dotard.

259 2018-06-19 23:24:56 I helped an old lady put oil in her car today while I was at work and now I just won a $100 dollar gift card. Rt for karma (can’t guarantee good or bad)

261 2018-06-19 23:24:42 I remember this one time my older cousin put cbd oil in my aunties drinks and they were so high. It was funny 
262 2018-06-19 23:24:17 The sheer volume is a prob. Over 1 million a yr crossing illegally. This is a tremendous number of ppl for a very small number of border agents do deal with. Effective barriers would help slow them down some. It is ridiculously easy to cross

278 2018-06-19 23:22:13 The Term is “oil field.” “Rigs” are drilling, work over and water rigs, that’s only one type of job in the oil field. “Rigs” aren’t refinery work either. That consist of pipe fitters, welders, scaffolders, etc. I’ve worked on big daddy rigs. It ain’t all the same.
279 2018-06-19 23:21:31 Olive oil everything.
280 2018-06-19 23:21:30 You have more than two options  You could ask these people why they take such a dangerous trip to get here and fix that. Ho no oil to steel.

There's obviously race and religion reasons involved, but the US wants oil and uranium more than anything

319 2018-06-19 23:14:56 Maybe what's about to happen is Iran will realize everyone is taking orders from Putin after they invited the Russian camel nose to peek under the OPEC tent. I hope Iran got what it wanted out of that Syria job. As I always say: "Oil's well that ends well."

What it should mean: A cheaper, less addictive MEDICAL oil to replace opiods.
What a lot of people think it should mean: Free HALLUCINOGENIC pot for all.

Here's hoping the correct choice is made..

They were quite happy lettiung ISIS destabalize Syria and it wasn't until Assad asked Russia for help that the ISIS oild racket was bombed.
353 2018-06-19 23:09:15 Trump just called and asked did I want to join Space Force 666. Told him go wash b4 I make him drink the WHOLE prayer oil bottle.

360 2018-06-19 23:08:19 CBD oil has no THC properties. In otherwords, you don't get high. They can give it to 6 year olds. It's fine.
361 2018-06-19 23:08:17 It’s a conspiracy by oil developers to turn democracies into dictatorships. So much easier to grease palms than work well with others. Just ask Putin. He’s got the greasiest palms of all, next to Trump. Sell everyone else out for your profit? Nice.
362 2018-06-19 23:08:09 6, No accountability at UN:
In 2005, Benon Sevan, the former head of the UN’s oil-for-food program in Iraq, took kickbacks to help selected oil companies.
Alexander Yakovlev, an officer in the UN’s procurement dept, took bribes in exchange for confidential bidding information.
363 2018-06-19 23:08:03 Sure Understood.  Just realize who you support comes with own consequences.
I sense u didn't like pipelines cause of environmental impact.  Lack of pipelines mean lack of oil, which makes gasoline more expensive so working man has to choose 2 drive 2 work or eat

387 2018-06-19 23:05:30 There’s that weed on the east coast that causes burns if you are in the sun or get water on it. Maybe coat the climbing wall in that oil.
388 2018-06-19 23:05:26 Art, many thanks. I used to invest in a few midstream companies, my understanding they need some sort of long term take away volumes to justify their investments. If shale oil wells decline rate is high, it will be hard to raise the capital
389 2018-06-19 23:05:10 I could make six figures protesting?!?!
390 2018-06-19 23:04:52 ooooo really keeping criminals off the street confiscating all those edibles and vape oil....sounds like a fucking joke to me. how about get some real criminals off the street and pursue child predators and actually make a difference . people who smoke weed arent bothering anyone
391 2018-06-19 23:04:32 i like cooking with coconut oil too but the moment i can taste the actual flavor im actually gagging
392 2018-06-19 23:04:23 Czechoslovakia didn’t have oil!
393 2018-06-19 23:04:20 I adapted recipes by Justin Wilson and Paul Prudhomme to make my own, Annie. They leave the choice open. I actually start with olive oil. Whether it's traditional is less important to me than it tastes like the gumbo I had in Louisiana, and the people who've tried it like it.
394 2018-06-19 23:04:05 No I just ignore the ones selling snake oil. #ClimateAction Anyone with an ounce of common sense should know it's a global wealth redistribution/ power grab scam. Perped by liberal socialists who crave global governance. #SocialEngineering
395 2018-06-19 23:04:02 You would have to despise the USA to not do all you can to stop Trump. He's not a snake oil salesman - he's a monster
396 2018-06-19 23:04:02 Last time I was down that way, a mass of strange leftists were engaged in unusual protest of an oil pipeline being installed south of Shafter, TX to points in Mexico.
397 2018-06-19 23:03:59 My late nonna used to (allegedly) remove the curse of ‘il malocchio’ (evil eye) with a concoction of water and oil. She could even do it over the phone if people weren’t able to visit her kitchen. I guess these days she’d do it by webinar...
398 2018-06-19 23:03:49 No you wouldn't. You would be sick and tired of them traipsing across your property, stealing from you and trashing the desert. 
We live it. You just read about it.
399 2018-06-19 23:03:44 #CannabisOil
How is it possible for the home secretary to allow cannabis oil to be used when the UK's official position is that it has no medicinal value at all .This must change now .. also , why is the UK the world's largest producer of medical cannabis if it doesn't work?
400 2018-06-19 23:03:33 Why these square chinned old block vintaged tv, baby powder, oil slicked, Casper the [REDACTED] looking ghost, prolapsed bum breath and un blended contour lookin asses think they’re funny
401 2018-06-19 23:03:11 Coffee,coconut oil ,Stevia, cocoa powder and there's something else I'm missing I think.
402 2018-06-19 23:03:10 お客様っ！！！店内で油田を掘るのは禁止です！！！

英文：Sir !!! Digging an oil field in this store is prohibited!!!
403 2018-06-19 23:03:00 Please sign.URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!
404 2018-06-19 23:03:00 Norway is planning to make all domestic flights electric dependent. Our president sees oil as the key element of our economy, he made himself oil minister.
Very soon, we go use oil drink garri
405 2018-06-19 23:02:55 If you do ... Start out small - and have a moisturizer on hand to dilute it. I began dabbing it on the area, let it set until it stung too much (I'm weird. I like to make sure it's 'working'.), then applied my moisturizer as normal so the oil was diluted (thus no sting).
406 2018-06-19 23:02:44 Depends on how much oil said country has.
407 2018-06-19 23:02:44 ギリギリでいーつも生きていたいからーアーアァーー！！！！！
408 2018-06-19 23:02:39 I got a oil change,  a new hoodie, some headphones....but that only makes up a little ledd than 300. Wheres the other 400 lmao lord please tell me i didnt blow that much on food 
409 2018-06-19 23:02:37 Corporate fascists or Nazi fascists- two sides of the same evil:

"Control oil and you control nations; control food and you control the people"
~ Henry Kissinger

"Let me control the media and I will turn any nation into a herd of pigs"
~ Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels

411 2018-06-19 23:02:16 @CoreyGraham did the oil kings hire a GM or is Hansch still making decisions?
412 2018-06-19 23:01:53 Trump’s more focused on getting ball is life mans to stop buying clothes over the border and oil than he is about the internal issues of America
413 2018-06-19 23:01:52 Why is #SAP doing development for IS-OIL as part of #S4HANA #Cloud #S4HC?  I can't think of any Oil&Gas customer I've worked with in the past that would use a cloud solution. At least for core ERP functions, they're mindset is on-premise.  Am I wrong?
414 2018-06-19 23:01:50 Once again I ask for the 1,000th time. What is the solution?
415 2018-06-19 23:01:48 Def like olive oil, salt & pepper on my salads more than dressing I’m weird idk
416 2018-06-19 23:01:25 I mean...

Just look at the fact that the *exact same doctor* was advocating both programs, for exactly the same reason, and claiming they are successful based on the exact same misrepresentation of results.

It's literally just the same old snake oil in a new bottle.
417 2018-06-19 23:01:19 I’ve reached the point in weight gain where I feel like if I eat a French fry my eyes will tear oil
418 2018-06-19 23:01:18 “Be uncomfortable; be sand, not oil, to the machinery of the world.”

What other state have I ever been in?
419 2018-06-19 23:01:14 Yur not “hooking ppl up” rather u r trying to bait them with some snake oil tea!  #youdrinkit
420 2018-06-19 23:01:03 What kind of oil do you use? liquid gold?
421 2018-06-19 23:00:51 OIL OF OREGANO
422 2018-06-19 23:00:41 Collard greens, (hell, any greens) sautéed in olive oil & garlic- with a blop of chicken broth for moisture to help cook. Now I'm hungry.
423 2018-06-19 23:00:25 ohhhh that stuff is good!! they have a sake shampoo i really like, also the coconut oil one is godly
424 2018-06-19 23:00:17 Got oil?
425 2018-06-19 23:00:16 Please maintain a safe distance from the hot oil spray.
426 2018-06-19 23:00:14 I want Kenny to pour me more oil for my bread
427 2018-06-19 23:00:14 nono its all good lol , i putted oil in it , it helps with clogged ears
428 2018-06-19 23:00:12 People have brought forth plenty of examples of successful renewable energy sources. All have been blocked because oil makes too much money. Coal mining is just another reason why our Earth is dying. Your leaders don’t care about you, dude.
429 2018-06-19 22:59:49 @BBCBreaking @CNN @JustinTrudeau Best way to retaliate against US Tarrifs is to buy #Oil in #Euro, # £, & Yuan. End of #US being super power.

431 2018-06-19 22:59:28 Water, witch hazel, coconut oil.
432 2018-06-19 22:59:20 I spilled diesel oil on my cast :-) debating if I wanna keep my wrist at this point :-)
433 2018-06-19 22:59:16 So the Koch Bros. Are trying to suppress building of public transit by having people go door to door to call it a tax grab because it doesn't  support automobiles and big oil and Aldo helps suppress the voters who need public transportation to get to vote.FUCKERS!! Front page NYT
434 2018-06-19 22:58:52 @oil_shaeikh fllw back sir
435 2018-06-19 22:58:48 Peter do you honestly think the SG would be allowed to close down oil even if the last drop was in Sauchiehall St?More of interest is how the fracking sites are chosen?FAUG Falkirk has pretty interesting reading on unconventional gas and Ineos
436 2018-06-19 22:58:42 Hello people, what can i put on (other than basic tanning oil) to get a nice tan bc I’m pale af & that’s gotta go asap
437 2018-06-19 22:58:38 “Are you taking a shot?” “THIS IS OLIVE OIL”
438 2018-06-19 22:58:31 - craftable voice communications radio (either more complex to build than the satellite navigation or you loot a radio from oil rig etc
--> then with this, you could have quests with somebody over radio maybe a rescue team, or perhaps u gotta help a sinking ship or oil rig etc..
439 2018-06-19 22:58:16 I used to use the same one for my hair. Also a special oil to make it look slick 
440 2018-06-19 22:58:15 Such  a beautiful sight! All Pet Releaf products back in stock. The ONLY USDA  CERTIFIED proprietary strain of organic, full spectrum, safe hemp oil.  This has been a life-changing formula for pets (and people) who suffer
441 2018-06-19 22:58:14 Good PSA don’t drink the snake oil that people try to sell
442 2018-06-19 22:58:14 Something I dont understand.  A hurricane hits and we deploy an army to deal with it.
We cannot find a couple dozen judges or mobilize transport to return them?
443 2018-06-19 22:57:21 It's actually a surplus with Canada if exclude oil, which the US needs to buy somewhere anyway as there is simply not enough domestic production to cover the demand
444 2018-06-19 22:57:18 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!
445 2018-06-19 22:57:15 I see what you did there,you can't be INEC chairman
446 2018-06-19 22:57:12 Oil changed , washer fluids topped, tires rotated, tank on full
447 2018-06-19 22:57:08 It was fun. You had, I think, smoke screens, oil slicks, and missiles(?) to take out enemy cars. I think it was on some arcade compilation that came out for the PS2 or the 360 or something. I just can't remember who made it...Namco?
448 2018-06-19 22:57:06 Back on top? Wait till we in Canada ,shut down the oil supply,water,lumber,steel and aluminum.  The truth hurts doesn't it?
449 2018-06-19 22:56:45 you must have a lot of ladies in the house
450 2018-06-19 22:56:39 This happened to my maternal Texas ancestors. But as soon as they were told they were no longer slaves they prospered some of the family moved to Oklahoma and became oil wildcatters!
451 2018-06-19 22:56:39 on this episode of chopped, I made cacio e pepe with lo mein noodles and chili oil. the italian judge and the chinese judge are having a fist fight over the authenticity of the dish

454 2018-06-19 22:56:19 Yes! I do oil cleanser, foam cleanser, toner, essence, serum, then moisturiser, hyaluronic acid w SPF15 (Neutrogena brand), and then lastly the FaceShop sunscreen.
455 2018-06-19 22:56:18 This man called deji pls stay clear of @segalink u are too shady, stained, deji u are a man lacking integrity. U defending @segalink is like u pouring palm oil on Sega's glowing white garment. Or u wan take Sega make name,  pls on place for attachment continue with yr yam eaters
456 2018-06-19 22:56:15 @JohnBrennan STOP. Stop saying Putin has something over 45. This is a partnership. This is GLOBAL OLIGARCHY.  I hate this narrative that he is being blackmailed. Why is it unclear this is about consolidating power and grabbing all the money.. ROSFNET OIL ownership/lift sanctions.
457 2018-06-19 22:56:14 So since we’re violating human rights en masse, oppress minorities, have a broken electoral system, support a terrorist organization in ICE, *and* sit atop a bunch of oil reserves, when is the star-spangled “coalition of the willing” going to invade the US and overthrow our govt?
458 2018-06-19 22:56:08 Allah ka qaramana imani da kusanchi dakai,indeed our iman is so low...
459 2018-06-19 22:56:03 Thank you! I just bought some cold-pressed castor oil and am hoping for the best 
460 2018-06-19 22:55:53 Whenever I read news stories about him to my wife, I usually refrain from calling him the "P" word as well. He's what people used to call a 'snake oil salesman'. He'll literally say and do anything to further himself no matter the cost to others.
461 2018-06-19 22:55:38 Non c’est faux ! La France a éliminé des patois d’origine latine ( mise à part pour le basque et le bretons ) pour les remplacer par un patois également d’origine latine mais de région parisienne, les ressemblances était grande malgré tout entre langue d’Oc et langues d’Oil,

463 2018-06-19 22:55:28 His ass needs whipping.
464 2018-06-19 22:55:14 The main reason that harmless cannabis oil is still illegal in UK is it contains THC .. which gets you stoned .. and the government would rather you didn't enjoy your medicine , preferring you to take  pharmaceuticals with nasty side effects .. !
465 2018-06-19 22:55:13 Clearly, since they deleted the tweet. 
466 2018-06-19 22:54:57 That’s stupid. So many people rely on the ganja for pain relief.  Or just stress relief.  Supposedly the oil is undetectable on drug tests.
467 2018-06-19 22:54:56 Dems dont mind. Pimping and weaponizing children doesn't bother them one bit. 
Harsh but true.
468 2018-06-19 22:54:39 Favorite things to cook with: salt, garlic, butter, olive oil & onions 
469 2018-06-19 22:54:37 I want a full body massage with hot oil 
470 2018-06-19 22:54:24 Demain soutenance de stage coeff 12 esh si je merde tout est foutu 
471 2018-06-19 22:54:21 Oil change time
472 2018-06-19 22:54:17 So because they had wars between them ,that gives you the right to attack and kill them for their oil ? Good logic . 

You should check what ties this countries have with America. But seriously dude you are wondering about Afghanistan ? You are living in a bubble
473 2018-06-19 22:54:06 كمان يعني مشرد وشحات ولك عين تتكلم روح الله لا يردك
474 2018-06-19 22:53:15 i have oily skin but im also hella dry rn n the oil just sits on top of my dry skin n i cant even put on moisturizer bc ill breakout what the fuck
475 2018-06-19 22:53:13 Yes
476 2018-06-19 22:53:08 Coconut oil?
477 2018-06-19 22:53:05 If he really cared, he would put his money where his mouth is and give money to Dems... he doesn’t!
478 2018-06-19 22:53:02 Two guys I started with - one from millionaires who owned a successful biz and another whose parents each had 6-figure jobs - have both become national writers and man do they bend over backwards to give Twitter the impression they grew up wearing second-hand oil rags.
479 2018-06-19 22:52:53 Remind the good people at home Iain, where will the money for an oil fund come from?
480 2018-06-19 22:52:36 Yeah that's true. Texas is too focused on its oil industry that it does not see the adverse health effects it is causing on the ppl who live around these plants.
481 2018-06-19 22:52:24 5 weeks and 3 gallons of oil later..
482 2018-06-19 22:52:15 I love my girl. She needs like $100 a week but she lets me ride around doing hood rat stuff with my friends. Oh and the occasional oil change. Farrah the F-250.
483 2018-06-19 22:52:13 Makes total sense thx for the color.. kind of like when oil was at $100+ in 1H14 before $DXY ripped & took down commodities. This time commodity specs off the chart again with oil. Low margin for error if something goes wrong.  Interesting that $PCAR stock looks awful.
484 2018-06-19 22:52:09 ...found some cbd oil infused maple syrup today. well done, NH #sugarhighandchill
485 2018-06-19 22:52:08 I don’t disagree with that but the fact is that the oil industry was here a long time before we took power and already a huge and important source of income for, unfortunately, the UK. You could say the same thing for coal. Fracking hasn’t been so there’s not the same imperative
486 2018-06-19 22:51:49 omg. i'm so done with my grandpa. 
GP: "you wanna hit leecha?"
me: "whut?"
GP: *holds up his CBD oil he got today for his back pain* 

487 2018-06-19 22:51:44 @JulieMcCrossin calls for more ‘visuals’ of women the reality of multidisciplinary teams within healthcare, no more statues and oil paintings of old men  #sldhinnovation #sldh
488 2018-06-19 22:51:35 Whatabout Whale Oil?
489 2018-06-19 22:51:06 It's still trying to invade other countries and steal their oil.
490 2018-06-19 22:51:05 So you got nothing. Technology still requires you take an individual into custody. You must track them down which takes manpower. The ease with crossing means a whackamole game. All you do is stroll across as easy as crossing from Oklahoma to Kansas
491 2018-06-19 22:51:03 After pouring boiling oil on you -- and your loved ones. He has no soul.
492 2018-06-19 22:50:47 At the car dealership getting an oil change . Let’s see how many thousands they want me to spend on other stuff 
493 2018-06-19 22:50:46 .You had an army of British Columbians who would of helped boost your message but you told them to fuck off and eat oil. For BC Kenney or Notley it is one and the same. Good Luck! #abed #abpoli #ableg #abndp #bcpoli #cdnpoli
494 2018-06-19 22:50:43 Today I got a mani/pedi, oil changed, went to a job interview & got the job, and changed my windshield wipers. Now I am celebrating by eating an entire bag of gummy bears. Good day.
495 2018-06-19 22:50:41 That's not mayonnaise, that's just eggwhites and vegetable oil...
Try that japanese brand ones
496 2018-06-19 22:50:34 I pay my bills then I think I’m good on cash then BOOM I need groceries then BOOM I need gas then BOOM I need an oil change  Mannnnn
497 2018-06-19 22:50:31 We have plenty of food to share with the world, but... capitalism. None of that wouldn’t be a problem if we actually started being environmentally conscious and stop investing in oil, and idk maybe actually giving a fuck about each other? But nah, you’re all okay doing nothing
498 2018-06-19 22:50:28 if i get like one more commission i can pay for an oil change woohoo
499 2018-06-19 22:50:14 Fire and Flies....
500 2018-06-19 22:50:09 Lmao try cleaning up only a 5 gallon jug of oil 
501 2018-06-19 22:50:07 I turned over all of my devices and Gun Oil to the FBI! hoping they can come up with some answers! stay tuned 
502 2018-06-19 22:49:49 So you can help the oil companies destroy deeper into the artic! How much do you have invested in these companies?
503 2018-06-19 22:49:43 こうつきさん捕捉しといた
504 2018-06-19 22:49:39 cetaphil oil control moisturizer and face wash
505 2018-06-19 22:49:35 I’ll bring the camera and the lube, you just gotta oil up that ass 
506 2018-06-19 22:49:33 When Erdogan was first elected I would have loaned him my truck ,today I wouldn't let him in it much less drive it His families ISIS oil dealings along with the money laundering & sectarianism are accepted in Turkey because the people, don't know anything else. ergo Ocalan rises
507 2018-06-19 22:49:27 June Pride Glass Sale! 15% off all glass and accessories and 20% off all colored bongs and oil rigs through June 30th.
508 2018-06-19 22:49:26 35$ for an oil change is way better than 50$ 
509 2018-06-19 22:49:20 It means you should add cooking oil to your engine And make a wish
510 2018-06-19 22:49:15 オイルがあるから、みんな生きているんだYO
511 2018-06-19 22:49:04 Don't get me wrong. I used redhat back in the 90s (installed from floppy) + debian and freeBSD when at an ISP for 6 years. But it's the same as any life work.. you wouldn't  walk up to an artist and tell them their art sucks because it's an oil painting and you do water colours.
512 2018-06-19 22:48:54 Oil & Gas come under the domain  of Uk govt believe this is a reserved subject and they issue licenses so why don't u direct your Q to them. Think you will find the UK govt also did rather well out of it financially
513 2018-06-19 22:48:51 If you are really interested in finding and keeping the right one, distance is not a problem. True, honest, real love ALWAYS finds a way. Take it from a long distance winner!
514 2018-06-19 22:48:36 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
515 2018-06-19 22:48:13 If it doesn’t work why is the uk the biggest manufacturer in the world of cannabis oil .stop farting about and legislate now . Posturing like this is ridiculous. Oh and I’m a Tory voter.
516 2018-06-19 22:47:47 Did we find oil in outer space already? Looks like Alpha Centauri needs some freedom. Send in the space force! #SpaceForce
517 2018-06-19 22:47:44 It’s not coming. It’s never coming. Even if the gas tax is lowered oil companies will just raise the price of gasoline to compensate. You’ll be lucky to save $1 on a 50 litre tank of gas.
518 2018-06-19 22:47:21 You know who else have hard stressful life threatening jobs? Oil field workers. But they aren’t Fucking assaulting and killing people of color. They risk their lives everyday too. Logic is Fucking FLAWED
519 2018-06-19 22:47:19 They are harder to get just needs more effort is all. You need to reproduce we need more conservatives 
520 2018-06-19 22:47:15 Never done that before. I made canna oil before and burnt it. Wasted an ounce of bomb weed.
521 2018-06-19 22:47:03 No one at White House does. Zinke self-dealing w/Halliburton, Pruitt cavorting w/ oil execs, chem companies, spending as much as he feels like, Kushner got loans, Ivanka got trademarks, Don Jr travelling world offering visits w/Pres if they buy condos. It’s insanity on steroids.
522 2018-06-19 22:46:54 Es para no creer. Esperemos que el Ejecutivo haga las correcciones del caso, así como anuló la adjudicación de lotes petroleros a Tullow Oil en nuestro mar del norte.
523 2018-06-19 22:46:44 *French fries. Needs a lot of oil though
524 2018-06-19 22:46:27 Starbucks keep pushing racial justice instead of making coffee.  They deserve to lose money! Claiming that all whites people are racist, well, it’s an offensive idea!
525 2018-06-19 22:46:27 Knight hemplar sells mold with the hash oil
526 2018-06-19 22:46:22 Its not that hard. You really just gotta twist in the direction they go, oil it and maintain the parts. Locs have the easiest maintenance

535 2018-06-19 22:45:15 And the level of consumption on wages that Americans can't live on ? This would indicate that sales taxes, which are not paid on many essentials, food, is very low.
536 2018-06-19 22:45:01 I will not pretend to know the whole solution, I know it’s not ripping kids from families, it’s not a wall.  There has to be technology solutions to try. And 100% sure it’s not using children as hostage.  Also sure part of the solution is a new president and VP.
537 2018-06-19 22:44:50 Great Sex Tip: when you're going down, try using essential oil while they grip the penis very hard
538 2018-06-19 22:44:47 Wait.  They advise them to attack 80's-era David Hasselhoff?
539 2018-06-19 22:44:22 Well, they taste nothing like raw radishes, a tiny bit of flavor from the veg itself, but olive oil salt and pepper. And the Parmesan is the crown on top, and where most of the flavor comes from.
540 2018-06-19 22:44:18 So sad
541 2018-06-19 22:43:58 I love the smell of tea tree oil
542 2018-06-19 22:43:58 Same bridge ,I think you could HV seen that on TV,I saw it while watching News in my school library then ,it was disastrous, till now no compensation. I saw their kids miserable life on eid day...
543 2018-06-19 22:43:50 And don’t forget your pizza and other delivery drivers who most get paid less then minimum wage  like waitstaff but also have more upkeep on there cars like oil changes and such
544 2018-06-19 22:43:32 sad to see a snake oil conservative snarkily commenting on stores closing...

547 2018-06-19 22:43:21 People went shopping walked into suzis with olive oil and vegetable oil . WhTs going on
548 2018-06-19 22:43:20 I may be naive but why aren't we helping immigrants at its source? We went to war for oil, why aren't we doing something for so many of these people in Central America and Mexico? Instead we turn our backs and don't have proper immigration laws. Shame, shame.

553 2018-06-19 22:42:39 Ontario will feel the pain that Alberta has been through. 150,000 jobs lost in the oil and gas sector. There is no hope that either the Liberals or NDP will chart a course for greater prosperity. Their concern is only on higher taxes, higher operating costs and gender fluid BS.
554 2018-06-19 22:42:34 It has to be paid for. Local jurisdictions raising taxes doesn't make housing more affordable. 
The cost of educating non English speaking is much higher not to mention many are far behind peers already. Its reality
555 2018-06-19 22:42:23 Did someone tell Trump there is oil in space or something? #SpaceForce
556 2018-06-19 22:42:02 Yes, me for example I'm in Costa Rica.
557 2018-06-19 22:41:43 Can’t you apply that same criteria to North Sea oil? Oil spills, Piper Alpha etc etc etc. The Scottish government isn’t closing down that highly polluting & dangerous industry - its value to the Scottish economy has been fully embraced by the SNP for many years. Why not fracking?

559 2018-06-19 22:41:17 I have been boiling chicken for stock all day. All I can see when I close my eyes are the oil drops that collect on the surface of soup. Halp

564 2018-06-19 22:40:59 Yeah, before the tariff. More than just cars from Canadian branch plants will be affected. The US is self sufficient in oil and gas now. How competitive will Canada's black tar be with a 25% tariff added to the price?

567 2018-06-19 22:40:44 You can’t get rid of oil and go all renewable energy without disrupting every industry that exists today. At this rate of consumption, oil will somebody be gone. What happens then? Madness?
568 2018-06-19 22:40:43 There’s an upper 1% who represent most of the wealth worldwide. Mostly built on oil and tech or stolen in the case of Russian oligarchs. That’s where the real power rests. The millionaires aren’t even players. Learned much from Dark Money by Jane Meyer.

575 2018-06-19 22:39:54 Compassion is fine. But rational thought must be exercised BEFORE a point of no return is reached where the prob exceed ability to deal with them.  That's social collapse. Striking a balance is key and hyperbole doesn't advance us.
576 2018-06-19 22:39:48 alright i made a hair mask w avocado, honey, coconut oil, aloe, apple cider vinegar, and a couple drops of vitamin e

588 2018-06-19 22:38:45 Do you still have participations in a oil company?? Do you still make business from this?
589 2018-06-19 22:38:08 Completely coating Your little micro in oil or lube, really making a show of it before you have your fun is REALLY good~

601 2018-06-19 22:37:24 This is an administration that: allows “hunting” of hibernating bears and bear cubs; advocates the destruction of the arctic for oil extraction; PROMOTES the release of CO2 into the atmosphere; and kidnaps children from their parents. This news is par for the course.
602 2018-06-19 22:37:22 If properly regulated and managed by competent personnel (no different than conventional oil and gas development), it will help to plug an energy gap. Enviro energy won’t do it. Would you prefer nuclear energy? Jump down off your fence people.
603 2018-06-19 22:37:07 Cousin has cancer, she goes for her op to get the primary site removed in three weeks. She’s been on the oil, tumours have shrunk and she’s in no pain. I started taking it for knee/lower back pain a month ago. I haven’t felt this good in decades.
604 2018-06-19 22:36:55 I’m also pretty sure the only healthcare program immigrants qualify for is emergency Medicare, which roughly translates to “not dying”

Correct me if I’m wrong though

645 2018-06-19 22:30:44 I would agree that the current system doesn’t incentivize skilled immigration, but I’m of the belief that virtually all immigrants are a benefit.

Limiting the number of refugees we accept for economic purposes seems rather callous to me, considering they do catch up over time.
646 2018-06-19 22:30:21 Not true. Health care, schools, state run and local systems all accessible. Many receive fed $. "Benefits" encompass a very wide range of services paid for by taxpayers

650 2018-06-19 22:29:41 The previous owner of my car works at the dealership I got it from so every time I come to get my oil change he comes out and makes sure I’m taking care of it. Today I had little tiny dents in it from the hail storm and he almost cried. Same bro same.

655 2018-06-19 22:28:06 Hi! Sorry! I have terrible reception at work. Is the tree a Camellia Sinensis or the Malaleuca? The Camellia is the one for tea. Actually most teas like Oolong, green, black and the white tea are made from this one. The malaleuca is for the tea tree oil.

672 2018-06-19 22:25:01 As for refugees, I support giving economic assistance to refugees from a moral standpoint. The economic result is probably positive in the long run and less so in the short term compared to immigrants as a whole.

676 2018-06-19 22:24:44 MSG was really demonized. So was palm oil (which is now being touted as some super food, but back then it was an import from o Noez SEA)

686 2018-06-19 22:23:35 Yeah I actually always use a hairmask, when I wash my hair. But those are from Elvive and I leave it on for like 3 minutes too. But this one said 10 minutes or even longer so I did? Maybe it was too long? I wonder why it's not working. I had high hopes on it. I should try oil..

740 2018-06-19 22:17:49 What's the solution?
741 2018-06-19 22:17:43 I've said for years that if WM had treated Scotland well, allowing inward investment and crediting the country with providing the resources that have kept Britain afloat for a long time (even before oil), demand for independence would be much lower.
742 2018-06-19 22:17:42 Yup! The fat, the oil and the pepper. Dangerous combo
743 2018-06-19 22:17:36 I agree with this in principle  If cannabis oil is beneficial for one human then why not granted for all who need it
744 2018-06-19 22:17:35 Lmao, shocked how you can't spell the PMs name! Why you whining, want some cdn cheese? the majority of Alberta oil workers just received 4.5 billion dollar pipeline built by Canadian taxpayers so stop your bitching. Canadians would gladly show you to the border!
745 2018-06-19 22:17:25 Now that’s a new game, MBS is trying to get Putin to backstop oil prices by buying missiles for hard cash. Iran is an old client so Russia can control them.

Better to accept it's a complicated world, and better the jobs ARE here, but shut up with the hypocritical cant
802 2018-06-19 22:11:04 We have a policy against buying palm oil associated w/ deforestation & have a grievance process in place to investigate these claims and take appropriate action. Our grievance progress has already resulted in the removal of one supplier from our supply chain.

813 2018-06-19 22:09:57 Which policies would those be exactly?  Lots of rhetoric, zero facts.  You don't just bounce back 4 years from a peak oil market to a massive drop.  You want to blame someone, blame OPEC, not the NDP.
814 2018-06-19 22:09:38 للتخفيف من التجاعيد اهرسي قطعه من الموز مع ملعقة من ماءالورد وضعيها على وجهك ورقبتك واتركيها قليلا ثم إغسليها،استخدميه مرتين أسبوعيا

816 2018-06-19 22:09:33 Amelle turned to me and said: America is going to turn us into a oil factory? I said, well, if they could, they would.
817 2018-06-19 22:09:18 Because they've been listening to a cadre of snake oil salesmen led by a liar-in-chief who sold them the demonizing image of brown people being animals, rapists, murderers, gang members & drug smugglers who are to blame for all their woes, & the fix is as simple as banishing them

820 2018-06-19 22:08:52 Oil changed...tires rotated. God gave you hands...use them.
821 2018-06-19 22:08:40 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
822 2018-06-19 22:08:34 You really know it's starting to be summer when you forget that all your coconut products melt in the heat and so you spill an entire tub of now liquid coconut oil on your kitchen floor #atleastitswarmoutside #myfeetareverymoisturized
823 2018-06-19 22:08:34 I drop oreos after a discussion with @MayganInSeattle some days ago. 
I hope we all can vote to remove palm oil & stop using dairy in the same place, then they can get more buyers.
It's unnecessary, ppl can be allergique & having traces of dairy can be gross for some of us!
824 2018-06-19 22:08:16 Create a leak in the line feeding oil to the turbine, so that oil will fall on the hot steam pipe and cause a fire.

826 2018-06-19 22:07:53 Today is a beautiful day. I am not so afraid that patients are being ignored. The challenge is for producers to provide at least one strain for $4.20 to patients and a nice discounted oil too $8.40. Lead the world in #compassion and example #420ForPatients #WholesaleForPatients
827 2018-06-19 22:07:52 Would it be such a bad thing, not having Saudi supply petrol/oil though
828 2018-06-19 22:07:51 The fire started under elevator and a lot of people behind me fell from the stairs trying to avoid it. I didn't hear the explosion when that started. Perhaps due to high temperature, the old lubricating oil caught fire and that in turn destroyed batteries? Please investigate.
829 2018-06-19 22:07:45 Put some oil in your car so it can come thru drippin’ (drip drip)
830 2018-06-19 22:07:43 If I had the funds, that would be something I wouldn't mind doing even for a woman.... That or change oil, tires, etc...
831 2018-06-19 22:07:37 after going 7,000 miles over i’m finally getting an oil change, making big steps today
832 2018-06-19 22:07:30 They can all get bent.
833 2018-06-19 22:07:25 New #papco pipeline would transport 8 million tons of oil which is equal to 20% of the road freight of the country. It might also shave RS 2 of the price of petrol. #pso #papco #oil #cpec

836 2018-06-19 22:07:18 It’s actually a gravy boat, hope this helps with the lack of oil in your vehicle
837 2018-06-19 22:07:18 Hide a, you have no credibility. That is not oil on the Magdalene river.
838 2018-06-19 22:07:17 Wow. I guess they didn't hear about the wind powered trains in the Netherlands?
I see having to have a car as a kind of trap set by the oil companies, the tire companies, the auto insurance companies. All so happy to have me pay and pay, for the "freedom" to sit in traffic.

841 2018-06-19 22:06:57 I realize that my constant pool of sweat that pours from my skin, when I walk out in the sun, can be from my use of coconut oil.
842 2018-06-19 22:06:43 Sooo i left my coconut oil in the car for a few hours and I didn't even think about it being melted when i brought it in so when I opened it i poured it all over me and all over the kitchen...long story short... Anyone wanna come over for a slip and slide?

847 2018-06-19 22:05:24 #CannIbisoil Why does medicinal cannabis oil get confused with legalisation of rec drugs. Opium based drugs are prescribed all the time but heroin is illegal. GROW UP PEOPLE.
848 2018-06-19 22:05:23 I know successful traders who only sell futures options, but when grains, oil, and euro all nosedive at the same time like that, there isn't much else to keep the boat afloat. I now believe a broader range of underlyings is better.
849 2018-06-19 22:05:12 Dow lower for 6 straight day, S&P drops most in 3wks on trade war worries US

850 2018-06-19 22:05:10 A common gripe is that welfare would lead to people coming only for welfare

Refugee status is specifically granted by the US to certain groups judged to be in danger. People coming over just to obtain welfare would most likely be rejected.

851 2018-06-19 22:05:06 In 2013 I was told by my consultant at the Royal Marsden that my cancer was incurable and given 22 months with chemotherapy.I stopped chemo and tried 60g of Cannabis oil as chemo had not worked in 2011. I am now cancer free &no one is trying to discover why this miracle happened
852 2018-06-19 22:05:00 It wasn't working though. Also I think the previous owner had been putting engine oil in there. They did motor repairs
853 2018-06-19 22:04:59 It's time to really make @realDonaldTrump and his base hurt. Time for Canada to play hardball. Let's turnoff all the fresh water taps going to the US and stop all oil and lumber shipments effective immediately. Trump says we like to talk eh? Let's put our talk into actions.

856 2018-06-19 22:04:20 Things that help you get thicker brows:

-olive oil

You can apply these things to your eyebrows with a cotton swab (directly into your brows)
857 2018-06-19 22:04:19 If I get my way  Steve will be spending all his time with his oil stocks portfolio.
858 2018-06-19 22:04:13 You mean rape the landscape for oil companies. This has NOTHING to do with the american people. You are a sham.
859 2018-06-19 22:04:12 Oo thank you! My mother actually takes evening primrose oil so I’ll ask her about it 
860 2018-06-19 22:03:27 So like coconut oil could be problematic in treating acne (making it worse), the above product has a chemical ingredient with the “acne inducing level” of coconut oil hidden inside. So it’s essentially just as bad as coconut oil. 

Once again, I stand to be corrected.
861 2018-06-19 22:03:10 It’s been downhill after the snake oil sales. I’m out. Lots better out there.

870 2018-06-19 22:02:25 Yeah I do know who's in the council and I think they all should be gone too. But hey I'm all for ending US global imperialism fueled by war and oil. And if this means that our "economically anxious" citizens pay the price for it then so be it. They voted for this.
871 2018-06-19 22:02:19 And when we default those bankers and bond holders will take our oil, gas and fresh water resources as payment to be auctioned off to offshore, tax exempt billionaires.  The land that once made the middle class the wealthiest in Canada will be serfs on that land.

931 2018-06-19 21:55:01 Just like oil and water can never mix, similarly if your fundamentals are poles apart, you can’t form an alliance. It’s basic. Hoping for better days and some relief in the valley. #BJPDumpsPDP #JammuAndKashmir
932 2018-06-19 21:54:51 why do people blot the oil off their pizza?! BITCH THATS THE BEST PART!!
933 2018-06-19 21:54:49 I wonder what is in the kickback arrangement that Trump made with the oil industry? You know Trump demanded a monetary "reward". He doesn't do or support anything unless there is a profit for him.
934 2018-06-19 21:54:42 Yes! I did it during the summer since I teach and didn’t have to go to work. After a couple of weeks my hair stopped producing so much oil. I now shampoo about 2x per week, condition daily.

It helps exfoliate the skin to remove excess oil. Mix a tablespoon of baking soda with some water and apply the past on the pimple. Remove it after 5 minutes.

941 2018-06-19 21:53:37 How's it possible that a major element of most modern economies adds absolutely no tangible value? From centuries ago, it remains essentially the same unchanged trade as snake oil sales & carnival hucksters. Advertising is a virus. There are few places it hasn't infected.

944 2018-06-19 21:53:31 During June 12, 1993 nobody demanded for a cup of rice or 1 liter of vegetable oil. Even fair in 1999. Sadly, our political sphere changed in 2003. Any politicians that knows his/her onions will not give substitute good governance with a cup of rice for votes.

948 2018-06-19 21:53:15 Trump rightly put the onus on Congress when he used pen/ phone to rescind DACA. 
Instead of bias, sexual conduct training we need some classes in constitutional process for our elected reps.
949 2018-06-19 21:53:12 He’s going after trade allies to make a trade war so that we have less influence over his decision to violate humanitarian law. He wants to play chicken. I say we run him over. Tax the water. The oil. The aluminum and lumber. And tax all Trump and family goods.
950 2018-06-19 21:53:01 Thought you were talking about oil can.

954 2018-06-19 21:52:16 The VP is touring to sell swamp oil. Neither VP or you are really listening, reading,making it you business to know.  Today Big retailer's having to raise Prices Now, and cut staff. Steel employer can't afford the steel any more for his product, having to lay off long time staff.

961 2018-06-19 21:50:58 the heart disease-inflammation hypothesis is still being tested -- the science isn't conclusive

more evidence you lot don't know what you're talking about

Also, there's no one who *recommends* corn oil. The standard recommendation is a med diet rich in olive oil.

964 2018-06-19 21:50:49 No. Será irrelevante en generación eléctrica (y hoy día lo es cada vez más en México, pues se produce poco fuel oil). Pero la generación eléctrica no es el único demandante de oil products: el 70% de la demanda proviene del sector transporte, y así seguirá un buen rato.
965 2018-06-19 21:50:44 What kind of oil do I use?? How long do I heat it?
966 2018-06-19 21:50:22 I'm having a love in with a small bag of petit pois.
Only oil I have is tea tree at the moment.

Turmeric  helps treat acne, remove oil from skin and lighten acne scars.

980 2018-06-19 21:47:29 Catherine:

I truly admire your green passion.

#hydro & #nuclear is green. Where is its expansion program? Where’s the Canada-wide energy corridor to transport oil, gas AND electricity coast to coast? That would be a great legacy for you &  @JustinTrudeau before voted out in ‘19
981 2018-06-19 21:47:28 Gettin new front tires and some fresh oil (finally)
982 2018-06-19 21:47:02 I LITERALLY TODAY GOT A BOTTLE OF BEARD OIL CALLED GRAVEDIGGER!

984 2018-06-19 21:46:47 -Tea tree oil (don't use it if you have sensitive skin) 
Tea tree oil helps fight the bacteria that cause the pimples. Apply it on the pimple with a cotton ball and wash it after 15 minutes.

989 2018-06-19 21:45:54 Hello Albertans, do think Albertans got their fair shares from the booming oil sectors in last twenty years?  I think the answer is “No”.
I might be wrong. What’s your take on this?
990 2018-06-19 21:45:49 This really helped me with spiders getting in. Buy some citronella oil and a travel spray bottle. Put six drops of the oil in the bottle, fill up with water and shake. Spray this around all of your doors, windows and vents. After a little while they just stop coming in.
991 2018-06-19 21:45:48 You ever criticize Trudeau for buying an oil pipeline and adopted the Conservatives' shitty CO2 emissions targets? Or do you only attack the CPC from the center?
992 2018-06-19 21:45:45 I mean I know I'm no oil painting but really not seeing all the fuss with this Zara one #loveisland
993 2018-06-19 21:45:44 Trading is when you see one extreme and a potential for the other extreme to develop.  Warm winter into rising oil and thus Natgas production is super bearish. Given CFTC managed money positioning at very one sided longs now it wouldn’t shock me if we headed back to $2 into 2019.
994 2018-06-19 21:45:30 @elonmusk so you're alluding to sabotage caused by other companies, but you JUST realized you needed a third assembly line to hit production goals?  If oil and gas companies are impediments to simple division, I'm worried about @Tesla
995 2018-06-19 21:45:07 Yes I have been adequately verbally chastised. 
Now, can you write a piece outlining your precise plan to solve this @laurawbush 
Yeah we all know it's a prob. Haven't heard a solid solution yet
996 2018-06-19 21:45:02 How did car mechanics convince ppl u need oil changes every 3k miles
997 2018-06-19 21:44:59 Worst purchase ever. Risky, without consultation, oil should be lesser of a focus if our kids are going to survive. The money better spent on Nuclear and renewables and sell hydro not oil. Don't let the Americans bully you.
998 2018-06-19 21:44:56 I’d never wish unemployment on anyone, but I though this dude was terrible. Not that good in ring, the personality of a wet sock. This dude got paid to raise his fist, tan, and apply baby oil
999 2018-06-19 21:44:56 Guess what this was and who the guilty one is and get entered into a giveaway to win the essential oil the plant extract is! I’ll announce the winner live tomorrow when I explain the benefits of this oil. #damndogs #alwayshaveanoilonhand
1000 2018-06-19 21:44:43 On Sky Press Preview stated not good to use children as pawns.But the recent today drug oil needed by children was using them.War areas use filming of children!. Its use happens everywhere.
1001 2018-06-19 21:44:38 @ChrisDanielShow Yep we would be the poorest state until....we started giving farmers water, started tapping the vas oil and natural gas reserves below us and started up the lumber industry again.

1004 2018-06-19 21:44:23 G-Eazy looks like that Italian cousin Tony who left the deli in Brooklyn to do cocaine in Miami bc he watched Scarface once when he was young & now he's just sweaty looking all the time & has enough mousse in his hair to be mistaken for an oil spill. He still loves his Nonna tho.

1010 2018-06-19 21:43:42 Trump had no problem dismissing regs that had banned pesticides which cause neurological damage in kids, regs that banned dumping coal mining waste in fresh rivers and streams, regs that stopped oil exploration in environmentally sensitive areas. Yet he doubles down on this one.

1012 2018-06-19 21:43:24 I think it's cos of the money/ oil/ power means he can do just that.

1015 2018-06-19 21:42:53 The next step is them annexing Canada for its oil supplies, right?
This feels uncomfortably like how we end up with the Fallout games. This is not good.
1016 2018-06-19 21:42:42 Us after Katrina when gas was $3/gal & oil was at $70/barrel: “Burn down the gas station!!!” Today with gas at $3/gal & oil at $50/barrel: “........”
1017 2018-06-19 21:42:35 This isn’t new. People have been showing evidence of Cannabis Oil as a treatment for epilepsy, cancer etc for decades. One can then only wonder why Labour didn’t address this issue during their 13 years of misrule? And why it is now only being tackled by a Tory Government.
1018 2018-06-19 21:42:32 I need some black seed oil

1024 2018-06-19 21:41:31 I've been taking 1,500 mg of evening primrose oil a day for the past few months now and after the first 6-8 weeks it started clearing up a lot of my cystic acne. I still get spots but soooo much less, would recommend that for sure
1025 2018-06-19 21:41:31 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

1031 2018-06-19 21:40:29 Not really. Oil was going up, but the Can $ wasn't. When oil fell, Can $ fell more. Why the Can $ weakness? BC Trump has lowered corp taxes in the US and Trudeau has raised the cost of living, plus not helped industry at all. Investors don't trust Trudeau. That's why.

We know it won't happen, cos the US is ALL about the OIL.
1035 2018-06-19 21:39:49 Eggs and butter are way different now than when we were kids. Eggs do not fill u up like back in the day. 6 eggs in that plate? It takes like 2 dz to make breakfast for 3-4 adults. Oh and butter used to be creamy and salty and now it tastes like canola oil w/ no flavor. A shame.

1054 2018-06-19 21:37:27 I know it wasn't an argument!  I think it's possible with savvy politics. e.g. Indonesia eliminated fossil fuel subsidies by taking advantage of the drop in oil prices and pledging to use the money for health care instead. More just and more sustainable!

1060 2018-06-19 21:36:19 North Korea has oil that no one knows about that’s what they’re so invested :/. Seriously tho it’s just Bec it’s trump and everyone’s set on proving him wrong. Also Bec he’s a republican imo the political climate has become ( or maybe always was) so polarized that they’ll prove
1061 2018-06-19 21:36:13 Which just makes it easier for oil and gun corporations to worm their way into government.
1062 2018-06-19 21:36:03 Iran’s oil exports dropped  by 16 percent to 2.114 million barrels a day in the first two weeks of  June, compared with the same period in May, according to Bloomberg  calculations.

1064 2018-06-19 21:35:56 I believe you are fighting the good fight and are courageous for doing so I just don’t think there will ever be much help for those at the bottom of society, our leaders only care about themselves and the people who are paying them i.e. NRA, Big Pharma, oil companies etc.
1065 2018-06-19 21:35:41 Saudi Arabia’s crude exports jumped in the first half of June, before  the world’s largest oil exporter meets with other producer states to  thrash out a collective production policy.

1075 2018-06-19 21:34:11 Let it rise for about an 30-60 min. 
Put 4 fingers of oil in a high pan and let it heat up. 
Try dropping a drop of dough in the oil and if it rises right up the temp is ready. 
Now here is the trick. Take a spoon with your left while putting your right in the dough.

1077 2018-06-19 21:33:55 Also do you know that Canada is the largest importer of electricity and oil to the US? Trade wars affect everyone? Your economy will suffer just as much. You Republicans like to make generalizations but can’t back it up. Do yourself a favour inform yourself.

1080 2018-06-19 21:33:49 They make stuff specifically for muscle pain! The oil is the best for soaking in quickly, but I’ve heard the salve is good if you’re able to actually get it massaged in. They also make products for anxiety and headaches!
1081 2018-06-19 21:33:48 Coba pke bio oil deh, katanya itu jg bisa but flek diwajah, selulit, stretch mark, termausk bekas luka.
1082 2018-06-19 21:33:43 Love it! UK media should be embarrassed the way their put everyone here off going 
1083 2018-06-19 21:33:43 yuuuup. i never knew before WHY they cared but I just saw in that article that they're in with oil/gas folks so of course they want us to drive more cars and use more gas.
1084 2018-06-19 21:33:38 I try not to eat tuna from the same place I buy motor oil. #POstables
1085 2018-06-19 21:33:23 Squeeze all the nasty ass juice out of it coat it in batter and fry it with veggies and seasame oil
1086 2018-06-19 21:33:11 Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. 
James 5:14
1087 2018-06-19 21:33:05 Is it that surprising, though, coming from people whose net worth is dependent upon Americans’ oil dependence?
1088 2018-06-19 21:32:45 Oh whoops! Maybe it was another project? Either way, public transit should be a good thing? (I saw that they seem to be linked to some oil people so lol of course they’re against public transportation)
1089 2018-06-19 21:32:33 Wish he would show that same passion regarding non responsive attitude of other fed agencies to congressional requests generally.  
Still not gotten an answer, " What is the solution?" I've asked a 100 ppl at least. Usually get blocked
1090 2018-06-19 21:32:26 Comey better get ready. His Democrats are preparing to throw him under the bus and drive back and forth until they squish him into oil on the asphalt.
They’re lovin Hillary way more than you in the IG Horowitz hearing.
1091 2018-06-19 21:32:06 So a truck just fell off Ojuelegba bridge and landed on 3 danfo buses and one private vehicle. Passengers are believed trapped. Casualties yet to be determined. And yes, the trailer and oil tankers madness from Apapa reach there sef.
Na prayer go save us for dis Lagos o.

1093 2018-06-19 21:31:54 Favorite part of getting my oil change, is going next door for a beer
1094 2018-06-19 21:31:52 Just paid for my oil change for the first time. I'm adulting
1095 2018-06-19 21:31:49 A: Yes. Yes they are. And they’re drinking Snake Oil by the gallon (it cures literally everything!!! )
1096 2018-06-19 21:31:47 Genuine Q: by what evidence was the decision to stop fracking informed? My understanding is the panel of experts commissioned for this decision returned a verdict that fracking can be done safely if existing safety regulations for oil extraction in Scotland are followed.

1099 2018-06-19 21:31:13 Why is it legal for opec to basically fix the price of oil. If they want more money they just slow production on purpose!!!!

1107 2018-06-19 21:30:19 You’ll get there. I’m growing mine out from last June and it’s finally shoulder length. The mullet-y length is almost gone  also using argon oil shampoo helped my hair grow much faster (like 5 inches in 3 months!)

1113 2018-06-19 21:29:48 Went from tanning oil to sun block real quick
1114 2018-06-19 21:29:42 Once they play Uruguay you’ll see that they can’t keep up with a country that actually plays futbol and aren’t all about oil haha
1115 2018-06-19 21:29:11 No argument from me about the museum. I have no idea who, in this day and age, would ever think that an oil painting of a slave trader was still glorifying slavery. No one in their right minds would think that. It's an old painting, representative of its time. A sad time.
1116 2018-06-19 21:29:06 usually*

I don't support the woo woo stuff he pushes.  "Changes in energy", "I feel a shift", etc. Also, the selling of supplements. 

Your retweet is def a very good take on the current issue, but I'd say at least 25% of his twitter is snake oil. I filter it it and still follow
1117 2018-06-19 21:29:02 Yeah it had me raging! The seizure passed on its own. No proof whatsoever that administering oil works that way. Seizures last 2 minutes tops so it's a matter of editing with that video. The oil does have some benefits, I see that from the research, but it is not used like that!!
1118 2018-06-19 21:28:58 It’s chasing cheaper oil and fracking from the Bakkan oil field. Not carbon tax that the industry supports. Losers always have to find somebody to blame.
1119 2018-06-19 21:28:54 Should never have to pay $60 for an oil change lol
1120 2018-06-19 21:28:52 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!
1121 2018-06-19 21:28:48 Two parts gasoline mixed with one part oil, one part soap. You put it in a bottle, stick a Tampax into the neck, and tape it shut with the string sticking out. Before you throw it, light the string and then heave it so it’ll break upon contact. The molotov is the poorman’s napalm
1122 2018-06-19 21:28:36 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
1123 2018-06-19 21:28:30 Indeed, but now you are back to my argument. Tap all American oil sources. But you already rejected that. It is a circular argument and not interesting.
1124 2018-06-19 21:28:30 Note to self : do not deep throat  a dildo that you just rubbed on your baby oil covered boobs. IT'S YUCKY
1125 2018-06-19 21:28:19 @tedcruz Do snake oil much?  On June 11 you defended @realDonaldTrump's #ConcentrationCampsForKids. It seems that you have changed your mind b/c @RepBetoORourke is making you look like the hypocritical stooge for Trump that you are. You don't care about refugee children.
1126 2018-06-19 21:28:18 Yeah I thought it looked like that, I turned to the side. I have to give a side a rest and bio oil it but it’s a mess after 1 and a half years on the pump 
1127 2018-06-19 21:28:09 The US market will thus, naturally continue it's short-term retracement... However, before the end of the year, DXY will reverse down. Equities will rally thus, oil will recover from a retrace (which I am forecasting shortly.. .
1128 2018-06-19 21:27:53 Even the use of the term 'fossil fuel' is #disinformation. Only a small portion of the world's oil stems from 'fossils'!!!
The major portion of the world's oil is #abiotic (renewable). The globalist parasites changed the name 2 provide them w/a means 2 create #ArtificialScarcity
1129 2018-06-19 21:27:52 i think i might have a problem I was watching chopped and this girl poured truffle oil all over her steak and I audibly gasped
1130 2018-06-19 21:27:48 Comfrey oil for the aches, and just keep waving them about, people will think you are very expressive and ask if you have Italian parents
1131 2018-06-19 21:27:27 As a former gas attendant (I prefer petroleum distribution engineer) I would say tips only if they go above and beyond like checking the oil or cleaning windows, which rarely happens these days.
1132 2018-06-19 21:27:27 Cannabis Oil to be legalised for medicinal use only.  Well it's a start

Zarka Refinary working with obsolete technology, high cost and waste during process,  refinary company used as a shield for crude oil purchasing fraud, let us make a trail to purchase the products.

It will be cheaper, clean oil deals.
1134 2018-06-19 21:26:47 Matthew went and got an oil change for my car, brought Peaches to the dog park, did laundry, and then made dinner for us while I was sleeping. #GetaManWhoCanDoBoth

1136 2018-06-19 21:26:21 So that is a weakly powered GWAS - very few ways it could used to predict anything. (Snake oil sales aside.) Educational attainment and height have some predictive power.
1137 2018-06-19 21:26:20 dollar up, oil down. Trump tweets regularly about his discontent with oil prices.. US, Saudi and Russia are teaming up against iran, iraq and Venezuela for production hikes in OPEC meeting on Friday..

1141 2018-06-19 21:25:48 Enbridge attorney Eric Swanson rejecting the idea that MN PUC is being presented with bad choices; says oil WILL move. Either by rail, truck or other pipelines. And BEST option is a new #Line3.
1142 2018-06-19 21:25:38 I don’t feel like putting this hot oil treatment in my hair 
1143 2018-06-19 21:25:27 Predictable. Oil and water.
1144 2018-06-19 21:24:57 Lots of current discussion at MNPUC about moving oil on Train v. moving  oil in Pipelines. Obviously pipelines are more efficient &  safe. What has been missed is damage &  cost to farmers of moving oil on rail at the expense of commodities. Replace #Line3 down Preferred Route!
1145 2018-06-19 21:24:53 17 months ago, we prayed over this ground, poured oil on it  for anointing, sprinkled salt on it for preservation, then broke ground for the Matthews Ministry Center. Today, the team began laying sod  in front of Matthews Chapel! To God be the glory! #wearemu #muishome
1146 2018-06-19 21:24:51 It's only GOP presidents that start wars-beside LBJ who's responsible for Vietnam. Nixon escalated & lied to the public. Bush 1 & 2 Iraq & Afghanistan. They want the oil & minerals. The Dems bring the troops home. Obama got BLAMED for doing that. And next... Trump & Bolton: Iran.
1147 2018-06-19 21:24:41 About to have a sixth military branch called Space Force? Man, we must have discovered another Planet with oil on it or something.
1148 2018-06-19 21:24:39 Taking pics of  the oil light, she gone fuck around and seize her shit
1149 2018-06-19 21:24:35 Most evidence ppints to iy being natural gas off our coast. Very different from oil
1150 2018-06-19 21:24:27 Amazing what a person can learn if they have any motivation. Not a direct hit on you but social media is full of lazy ignorant human parrots that have sum total of human knowledge right in front of them.
1151 2018-06-19 21:24:11 5. queens varies each year.  Divide welfare to corporate welfare queens over many years by number of years to get an idea of how much per year.  Pollution from coal and oil increases health care costs by trillions of dollars over time - asthma, cancer, etc.

1153 2018-06-19 21:23:34 Jacob sets up a pillar and anoints it with oil, God later bans this practice (Deut 16:22) presumably because people were getting a little too idol-worshippy with them
1154 2018-06-19 21:23:29 Why wait 20 years? We could be free of opec oil, increase jobs, and save the environment. But instead we are suckling at the teet of the Saudis or Venezuela or Russian oil.

1160 2018-06-19 21:22:07 You say that but why do political parties, charities and businesses do it? Is it snake oil or do older folks still read pamphlets? I'm just suggesting getting organised :) not having a go

1183 2018-06-19 21:18:29 I'm two summer cookouts in and I've gotta say Ruffles are better than Lays. I like the mouth feel of Lays but they're too salty. Ruffles have a better oil-to-salt ratio. Plus, Ruffles hold up far better to dip.
1184 2018-06-19 21:17:59 But seriously tho. Change your oil as soon as you can.
1185 2018-06-19 21:17:58 For youthful skin, mix 1 cup brown sugar, 1/8 cup olive oil, 1/8 cup oatmeal, 1/4 cup mashed figs, 1 oz vanilla. Leave on 20 mins.
1186 2018-06-19 21:17:50 Interesting graph, but misleading, as its % of energy use. Even IF its correct, and I doubt that almost growth in renewables, by 2050 our energy usage has increased by 30%, so amount of oil/gas usage is not falling by much. We clearly still need gas! That's what this shows...
1187 2018-06-19 21:17:49 Oil change?
1188 2018-06-19 21:17:47 The democratic double standards are just beyond belief...this isn’t the first administration to separate illegal families
1189 2018-06-19 21:17:26 -- find Me, I found the light switch and turned it on, sparks flying from the broken bulb and setting the oil on fire. Soon the warehouse was set ablaze. The men in your room run out leaving you behind, and moments later I arrive and rush over to you*
1190 2018-06-19 21:17:24 Agreed that the legal interests question is only part of a larger debate, but disagree about the element of crime analysis. A little more complicated than twitter can handle, so will burn some midnight oil before vacations to get something online this week.
1191 2018-06-19 21:17:17 I got some sweet potatoes cooking in the oven with olive oil, salt, garlic powder, and crushed chipotle pepper. They've only been in the oven for 15 minutes and already smell delicious 
1192 2018-06-19 21:17:14 My, how time flies! Why, it seems like just yesterday that I had 500 miles to my next oil change.

1198 2018-06-19 21:16:32 i don't want to ever hear this is a "christian" nation ever again....that is a lie from the pit of hell which is now located in the oval office of the white house with the snake oil salesman in charge...!

1207 2018-06-19 21:15:42 Yeah right. More oil found in the last two years than in the 70’s. Course it’s running out. In 70 fuckin years. West of Shetland is brimming with it though this Westminster disaster of a parliament are peddling the serfs doom n gloom whilst rubbing their grubby hands for dollars

1215 2018-06-19 21:15:13 Yes, don't know if it's available anymore, now that I think of it.  There used to be a cooking device that would pop popcorn without oil.  I'll do a Google and get back to you.

Of course, a middle-aged white man would have been laughed out of every investor's office long before even starting it.

1225 2018-06-19 21:13:35 Should there be a range for penalties:
1) Helicopter - only if they are #socialists, I mean dems. Also, costly.

2) Firing squads, - More honorable than hanging. (6) .30-06

and my favorite:

3) Hangings. Hangings are for criminals. Rope, gibbet.

1229 2018-06-19 21:12:49 I haven't been following this issue and I don't know enough to comment but I will agree pipelines are the safest way to move oil and that it's in the national interest to diversify our client base.

1231 2018-06-19 21:12:41 Maybe I could just soak in a tub of oil - nah, too much work to clean it up afterwards, but sure would feel good. Drink a little wine and eat some dark chocolate!
1232 2018-06-19 21:12:30 We're in the next town over to get my oil changed still a 45 min drive yikes lol
1233 2018-06-19 21:12:10 And by a huge margin. Mind you if we had gone independent it’s a good thing we have all our oil money...oh wait....
1234 2018-06-19 21:12:08 Bio oil I've heard is really good for scarring and stretch marks!
1235 2018-06-19 21:11:55 Lots of current discussion at MN PUC about moving oil on Train v. moving oil in Pipelines.  Obviously pipelines are more efficient &  safe. What has been missed is damage &  cost to farmers of moving oil on rail at the expense of commodities. Replace Line 3 down Preferred Route!

1291 2018-06-19 21:04:50 Tipped is too good for ‘em, Tom. It’s boiling point is too low. I would go for boiling oil and let that be a lesson to them!  Good to see we’re on the same page though !
1292 2018-06-19 21:04:24 Yeah, it does.  Why would they even mention those. Heck I had a bad oil change and my car leaked more than that. (and I had it fixed right away).
1293 2018-06-19 21:04:09 Pics or it didn't happen!
1294 2018-06-19 21:03:59 A wonder if Iain ‘Uncle Tom’ Gray will tell us like we’ve been told before that oil is a burden for a country? As long as it helps London.. Labour and the Tory’s are happy. Traitors to Scotland every single one of them.

1298 2018-06-19 21:03:39 To be fair, most Perry investment has abandoned heavy oil in favour of sweet and shale plays around the world. The continued expansion of Albertan resources will never be at the breakneck speed we saw prior to the shale revolution.
1299 2018-06-19 21:03:35 You’re correct about the lack of qualifying conditions. I’m voting YES anyway. 

You’re incorrect about the other thing. I see those CBD places around my city, too. However, CBD oil is manufactured from hemp (not cannabis), and it does not contain THC.

As much honey as you want to your level of sweetness. (Start with 1/2 tbsp. and work up from there.)

This makes enough for a generous 2 person salad.

1344 2018-06-19 20:58:49 You can bet the Owners never go to WALMART to get their oil change
1345 2018-06-19 20:58:49 Have you tried kratom and black seed oil with cannabis and music. The black seed oil helps with inflammation and makes kratom work better. The cannabis makes it easier to leave your body and drift off into the music. I'm also using tianeptine although I hate taking chems it helps
1346 2018-06-19 20:58:48 Regular chips + tons of ground cayenne pepper  + drizzle of oil + shake well = decent substitute for anything flamin' hot #savedmylife
1347 2018-06-19 20:58:45 Cringeful! Makes no difference what oil you use once it reaches frying temperatures.

1356 2018-06-19 20:58:01 Cannabis(CBD) Oil'i kesinlikle araştırmanızi tavsiye edeceğim. Hem acıyı azaltıp sakinleştiriyor, hem de vücutta tümör ve bakterilere karşı çok etkili. Doktor recetesiyle yurtdisindan alabilirsiniz.
1357 2018-06-19 20:57:57 STOP TRYING TO CHARGE ME $80+ FOR AN OIL CHANGE JUST BECAUSE I’M WEARING A DRESS!

1360 2018-06-19 20:57:51 Actually I buy, premium beef, mushrooms (so expensive) sausages different types (more expensive than beef) veggies mostly green and 
 cauliflower (super expensive here) olive oil to make my own mayo (you need to sell a kidney for that one) 85% chocolate, cream cheese. Delicious!
1361 2018-06-19 20:57:45 Once I have the sportster and get the oil cooler and a new carb I’m gonna have to buy a grom just for the fuck of itZ

1364 2018-06-19 20:57:15 Bought some more CBD oil cartridges for myself and Marco. 

Also picked up some cbd gummy bears & cbd chamomile tea for my brother in law’s mom who is undergoing treatment for cancer. I’m really hoping if helps with her nausea and pain.
1365 2018-06-19 20:56:57 Yayy! They had me scared for a sec. I used a groupon plus 2 coupons for that oil change. Phew

1374 2018-06-19 20:55:15 Anyone need some cod liver oil? Only used like two but can't take anymore due to it containing gelatine which I wasn't aware of. Let me know. It's in soft capsule form.
1375 2018-06-19 20:54:56 Wow
1376 2018-06-19 20:54:52 It was! My hair needed the oil treatment badly - this dry, dry weather definitely takes its toll.

1377 2018-06-19 20:54:41 Think we would have heard of him, like, don’t ya think? Like him being the Minister of Natural Resources,like doesn’t that have to do with oil? Just wondering in Alberta.

1378 2018-06-19 20:54:33 Well when your only "talent" is being over 7ft tall (and like 80% legs), it's not hard to see why. Dude abused baby oil something fierce, and somehow thought that just raising his fist in the air over and over again somehow made him a heel.

1389 2018-06-19 20:53:43 Dear Mr. Kenney. Correct numbers, incorrect conclusion. Even today, after significant cost cutting due to low oil prices, oil sands projects still require $50 (in situ) and $60 WTI (mine) for greenfield, which is why producers switched to brownfield expansion. It's not the regs.
1390 2018-06-19 20:53:33 FYI some industries do have labour shortages, just not necessarily oil & gas. Some of those laid off folks may have to accept retraining, and earning <$150,000 per year.

1392 2018-06-19 20:53:11 I THINK there is other stuff in the cannabis oil including hallucinogenics but not in the CBD which I take.
1393 2018-06-19 20:53:10 Actually we are a far ways away from ever drying up in oil. That’s just a myth. We only drill 10,000 feet below the surface and will go deeper and we have so many protocols to protect the earth beneath.

1401 2018-06-19 20:52:34 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.
1402 2018-06-19 20:52:31 A little Bonner hemp oil on a wet paper towel should more than suffice as a disinfectant
1403 2018-06-19 20:52:21 What makes me sick is policy that encourages people to send children through a gauntlet of death and destruction to get here. 
On top of that billions to countries sending them

1405 2018-06-19 20:51:59 Chicken thighs seem to be our go-to. We marinate them in shish tawook spice, sumac, red wine vinegar, S&P, and olive oil. What about you?
1406 2018-06-19 20:51:46 Oh& here was me thinking @IanGrayMSP was reminiscing about that unforgettable moment when he stood up at Holyrood with that legendary gormless look as he demanded to know where were SNP proposing the money would come from for An Oil Fund
No that was worthy of a few 

1407 2018-06-19 20:51:25 Trump complaining about Canada and Mexico. What a piece of shit. Ruining the world as fast as he can. 
Doesn't say a word about the oil they get from Canada for what is it now60 cents a barrel. Then they refine it and sell it back to us for 50x that cost?
1408 2018-06-19 20:51:22 Ladies when they say castor oil works wonders on the hair it is very true!
1409 2018-06-19 20:51:20 He's certainly mastered the Windrush issue (in terms of public perception) and his action over cannabis oil has made May look like a fool.
1410 2018-06-19 20:51:12 Idk why the car salesmen get you in and out when t come to getting a car but the dang mechanics take a decade and a century to change oil 
1411 2018-06-19 20:51:07 It'll all end in tears ,when people start going blind and dying from the bath oil
1412 2018-06-19 20:51:02 Not common sense at all. How can you be a criminal if having it isn't a crime, use your head. Recreational isn't the same. UK has an NHS medical would be free on NHS but not recreational. Tell me one person on benefits who can afford £50 for a gram of cannabis oil every day

1424 2018-06-19 20:49:05 I’ve been driving for almost 6 years and I still don’t know what to do when I go to get an oil change lmao

1431 2018-06-19 20:48:31 I can’t help with the dental, but as far as the chronic pain, I’ve been using CBD oil recently and it works really well! It’s relatively inexpensive, so if you can find it in your state it might be worth a try?
1432 2018-06-19 20:48:23 Routine oil change, tire rotation, and inspection. Just had no idea what oil my car took. Felt like half a man

The politicians are perfectly fine, don't worry

Stratified in their ivory towers with their armed security, high above it all

The rest of us are screwed, true - but no politician is loosing even a wink of sleep because of that

Why would they?

1498 2018-06-19 20:39:58 While OPEC+ meets, it's worth noting that four years ago tomorrow -- June 20, 2014 -- U.S. oil prices peaked around $107 a barrel. American drivers forked over $3.50 for regular gas.

Then prices collapsed. OPEC didn't budge. New era began. 
Seems to be over now.

1569 2018-06-19 20:30:22 The problem with cannabis oil is that its natural. No drug company has an incentive to get it licensed as it can't be patented.  If a drug company spends ££ getting it approved, all others can market it.

Govt should see if approved in other EU country and they can then OK it.

1736 2018-06-19 20:12:25 Sure does. However, any serious plan on climate includes a carbon price with absolute not intensity-based targets. Any serious plan also acknowledges that Canada's carbon budget cannot accommodate growth in the oil sands.

1747 2018-06-19 20:11:33 Trump administration has quietly asked producers — widely believed to include Saudi Arabia, a US ally and fierce rival of Riyadh — to ease output restrictions to make up for any drop in exports from Persian Gulf country, whose oil industry is facing a new round of US sanctions.
1748 2018-06-19 20:11:30 Commissioner Katie Sieben said the PUC's task was "a bad decision either way." Either the new pipeline gets approved and the construction is disruptive to the environment or it is denied and the old Line 3, in need of many repairs, remains in service and risks spilling oil #line3

1750 2018-06-19 20:11:07 What can we do bout it? PoW mining always gravitate to places w/cheap electricity. Oil reserves not distributed uniformly, US gets to print world reserve currency, enjoying exorbitant privilege. That’s the way cookie crumbles, we’ll see how crypto evolution influences geopolitics
1751 2018-06-19 20:10:59 Why not? What the fuck is ur issue with Pak? Ur country had the resources and dinars/$$ including oil but ur ppl and army were not able to defend the country and all the holy places. Now it’s back to stone age cos of wrong decisions and actions. So think before saying something.

Oil companies can't pays oil price to only IRAN

Costumers never bought oil on UDHAR or govt never give any Subsidy on Oil during ( 2009-2014)
Ok
1765 2018-06-19 20:09:47 #ukog not forgetting the increase in oil price more than compensates for the dilution in shares since 11p was hit last time.

1774 2018-06-19 20:09:05 Similar thing happening here in ND with oil. We get a ton of Mexicans on work visas who come up in summer because the weather is way more bearable.

1782 2018-06-19 20:08:38 Agree w part of this....the transit agency in Houston bought petroleum in MASS. People rail against oil industry in Austin TX---and mass transit company recently deleted routes....servicing schools, hospitals/clinics and infrastructure.....

1785 2018-06-19 20:08:23 Skipped my Neogen White Truffle Serum in Oil step because the oil in the FCAS mist felt just right. Bottle is reminiscent of my 1st taste of Cristal. Just call me Goldilocks. It's only day one, but this feels like a winner to me.
1786 2018-06-19 20:08:21 300,000 bbl/d to the Quebec market helped a lot on top of about another million bbl/d to US.   Pretty much eliminated the light oil differential.  

Now we need to work on the western select differential. Liberals are zero to any market but we know they are trying.

(Bloomberg) -- A deal to phase out OPEC production curbs after oil prices rose is unlikely.
Iran will not accept even a modest increase, and unanimity is needed for accord to be reached
Even a compromise boost of 300,000-500,000 b/d not needed

1879 2018-06-19 19:57:26 Notice how the stand dude in the start makes it sound as if the oil that will be in the new pipeline is for the USA ? When in fact the new line will enable Canada to sell our product on the world  market. 
Deliberately misleading people.
1880 2018-06-19 19:57:04 Then, she said because our chicken looks white. I said ma’am it is fresh oil from this morning it gives our chicken a nice soft golden brown  oh my lord
1881 2018-06-19 19:57:04 ...but I was politically uneducated at that time. Obama wasn't just trying bring the Oil Industry to heel, he was intentionally trying to destroy our country
1882 2018-06-19 19:57:04 Tricky one just a thought would olbas  oil deter them?
1883 2018-06-19 19:56:55 @RichieAllenShow swim my mate makes crude canibus oil by cramming as much bud  as possible into a plastic pop bottle hole in the bottom Squirts 2 cans of lighter fuel into the bottle what drips out the hole is canibus oil no idea if this would work
1884 2018-06-19 19:56:50 #RUSEGY
Russian players r tough 
I doubt they  are only aiming at winning the world cup, Putin must have promised them oil wells
1885 2018-06-19 19:56:49 WTI Crude Oil -1.2% to 64.90 bbl $USO
Gold -0.1% to 1278.30 oz $GLD
Copper -1.9% to 3.05 lb $CU
1886 2018-06-19 19:56:47 The windows aren't, but the natural resources - oil, soil, air and water - they lower demand for / protect are all strategic and shared resources.
1887 2018-06-19 19:56:39 The only tea tree oil I have is in an exfolaitor but it might work if I put it on the area but don’t scrub maybe. Thank you xx
1888 2018-06-19 19:56:26 Just do a research on the cost of cement around African countries. Find out who supply these countries, price & difference. Let's leave oda products for now. I records of those behind forex business in Naija etc, oil cabals etc... unfortunately they're the billionaire in Naija.
1889 2018-06-19 19:56:20 This is long awaited. Tilenga FID will be a long stride in oil and gas production. A fair ground for engagement of the local and international players in the industry
1890 2018-06-19 19:56:11 Everyone knows you just fill it to the top like a jar of olive oil. You can't have too much oil.
1891 2018-06-19 19:56:04 Love that. .  Wonder if he uses olive oil. 
1892 2018-06-19 19:55:55 Can’t wait to get home and put coconut oil on my hair 
1893 2018-06-19 19:55:43 tea tree oil or an Aztec clay facmask from Amazon !
1894 2018-06-19 19:55:36 I’m thinking about that video where this lady was promoting a hair growth oil and she was like ‘I got haiiir I got my edges back I got haiiir”
1895 2018-06-19 19:55:34 Absolutely, if the antidote to the chemical inflicted on the two russians poisioned had been cannabis oil there would have been no hesitation in administering it.  To deprive people of medication which eases suffering and prevents death is utter madness.
1896 2018-06-19 19:55:24 If people are really upset about this, they should have opened up their mouths when their favorite party was in power.  I watched the government attack innocents during Dakota Oil Pipeline and dems did nothing. Obama did nothing
1897 2018-06-19 19:55:20 *BRAZIL IS SAID TO SEEK 2018 PAYMENT TO PETROBRAS FOR OIL RIGHTS

Chegando a hora... cessão preguiçosa acordando.
1898 2018-06-19 19:55:20 RIGHT! I know it was the African lady who gave me my hygiene box and seen me use it, but i ain’t have evidence. She the only one on that staff who would have known the benefits of that oil 
1899 2018-06-19 19:55:18 I’m gonna start drinking castor oil next week and whatever else I can get my hands on
1900 2018-06-19 19:55:15 I tried it once AND I'm boring!  Could do with trying it again for my arthritis. I had the best sleep of my life when I tried it! Just trying that CBD oil but at £65 a bottle, I won't be buying any more!
1901 2018-06-19 19:55:11 If you struggle with #insomnia or #sleeping soundly through the night... supplementing with #magnesium oil can help promote #restful #sleep.
1902 2018-06-19 19:54:59 We had this house built in 2005 it has all the extras heat pump.. Wood furance if i get real cold I keep it 90 to 95 in the winter.. Oil furance if its not to bad..
1903 2018-06-19 19:54:59 She’s moisture Jamaican black castor oil shampoo! Switch it up with co-washes in between to help stop with the drying !
1904 2018-06-19 19:54:49 
Morality & Kenyan politician are like oil & water. Meaning that the Lifestyle audit is DOA; unless @UKenyatta Does something bold & crazy. 
Fortunately for him, Citizens are firmly behind him; they will cheer him if he summarily executes every suspected thief.
1905 2018-06-19 19:54:49 The way some girls like guys with cars eh, you'll be forced to think if they were breastfed with engine oil
1906 2018-06-19 19:54:45 no small - かなりの、少なからぬ

He has no small interest in oil paintings.
彼は油絵に少なからぬ関心を持っている。
1907 2018-06-19 19:54:29 I'm pretty good at "burning the midnight oil"
1908 2018-06-19 19:54:20 I’m covered in coconut oil laying in the sun... this is a high point
1909 2018-06-19 19:54:18 I DID THIS ONCE. There was a fish oil capsule in my pocket and it destroyed my clothes. I smelled phantom fish oil on everything for WEEKS
1910 2018-06-19 19:54:15 I fried some bacon to make a sandwich and now I’m self conscious at the library that I smell like oil.
1911 2018-06-19 19:54:10 You never cease to amaze real Luke. That imposter isn't fit to unscrew the cap on your bottle of cod liver oil.
1912 2018-06-19 19:54:06 Citronella Essential oil is a great mosquito repellent.
1913 2018-06-19 19:54:05 Measure nine scoops of olive oil then take off heat.
1914 2018-06-19 19:54:02 Traffic when approaching JAKANDE from WORLD OIL FILLING STATION is moving slow and steady @Gidi_Traffic
@AirtelNigeria #TELTrafficReport
1915 2018-06-19 19:54:01 The first time i saw someone post one of those syringes full of oil i was like "why would you brag about doin heroin?"
1916 2018-06-19 19:53:59 Everyone in Eugene decided to get their oil changed today . This is fun
1917 2018-06-19 19:53:59 I am i the only one wondering what Putin said to his team? Because this Russian team is on fire all of a sudden going through these Arabs like they are revenging for the hike of oil prices.
1918 2018-06-19 19:53:56 If I make an appointment it’s because I have other things to do and am giving you the time frame of which I am available. Why have I been waiting on my oil to get changed for two hours?! It literally takes 10 minutes to change car oil.
1919 2018-06-19 19:53:54 The worst thing about going to get your oil changed is the people changing your oil trying to sell you extra shit you don’t need.
1920 2018-06-19 19:53:50 This world cup coverage need a lil coconut oil
1921 2018-06-19 19:53:49 Egypt will play Egypt the last group game whoever win will go with pyramid or oil
1922 2018-06-19 19:53:45 You want to talk about spending taxes wisely, we can have that talk. Let's start by cutting military spending and especially stop the black-box-spending that The Pentagon does. Every dime should be accounted for. Let's talk about cutting subsidies to oil companies(winners/losers)
1923 2018-06-19 19:53:41 And if our PM has any balls, The United States will no longer take advantage of Canadian oil...
1924 2018-06-19 19:53:39 Was at Meineke early getting my oil changed and noticed a young kid staring at me awkwardly. He then asked if I had a YouTube channel because I look like someone he’s subscribed to. Lil homie legit seemed star struck and that interaction summarizes this generation. #FalseProphets
1925 2018-06-19 19:53:38 Agreed. All these @EddieHearn fanboys are the new Jonestown cult. They'll believe this snake oil salesman til their death
1926 2018-06-19 19:53:22 Omg I’m so excited , littlenoil or no oil at all?
1927 2018-06-19 19:53:22 Lipgloss not uncomfortable to y’all ? I mean it’s cute but it’s not me. It’s too sticky so I use baby oil gel.
1928 2018-06-19 19:53:20 The US could have 46 trillion barrels, Rusia 74 Trillion barrels, Canada 50 trillion barrels, Argentina 73 trillion barrels, Saudi Arabia will deplete it's oil field in 2040 if not before,with SCO2 and nuclear energy break cost of 10U$S

Does really OPEC matter anyway today?
1929 2018-06-19 19:53:09 Tea tree oil, love 
1930 2018-06-19 19:52:57 indeed. if only it was only money... oil and gas has always been core to the Colorado economy, but in recent years RE east of here, in the heart of the oil patch, has skyrocketed, upward pressuring prices here. I have to assume an oil crash will hurt us directly. 
1931 2018-06-19 19:52:48 The best ingredient for engine is the oil
1932 2018-06-19 19:52:24 The EU referendum is certainly far more than excuse. A referendum based on lies on HMRC/ship building jobs, strong shoulders of the Union for the oil industry, the Vow, all of those would be excuses EU residents have the vote in Scotland and certainly would have voted No on a lie
1933 2018-06-19 19:52:04 The hemp gummies and the hemp oil that you add to your E-liquid for my vape. I'm so excited for this thank you for the chance to win this amazing prize. I would love to win this . The hemp oil and gummies would help my pain so much. I had my heal bone removed so I'm disabled. Ty
1934 2018-06-19 19:52:02 More people would watch a show about FIRST PEOPLE(INDIANS) FIGHTING AN OIL PIPELINE GOING THROUGH THEIR WATER SOURCES!!!
1935 2018-06-19 19:51:38 The oil companies are much less powerful than they were.  You're out of your mind.  Exxon used to be the most valuable company on earth, and now even after merging with Mobil they're 1/4 as valuable as Apple.  By your reckoning, Apple should have a huge influence to sell phones.
1936 2018-06-19 19:51:18 i hear theres oil everywhere in Saudi Arabia, all canada has is beavers and uranium

1939 2018-06-19 19:51:10 all this oil keep getting trapped in my pores and it’s causing me to breakout 
1940 2018-06-19 19:51:10 Ladies, save yourself some money this summer. Don't buy those expensive blotting papers. Stock up on those shitty, brown napkins from McD's. They're specifically designed to adsorb a shit ton of oil. And you can take as many as you like.
1941 2018-06-19 19:51:07 I agree about bullying. But the key problem with learning styles is that most of the models are owned by private firms who profit from their use. Literally snake oil salesmen...

1944 2018-06-19 19:50:52 Keep peddling that Snake Oil, maybe you can get these people to pay for 5 more tax free jets for you.
1945 2018-06-19 19:50:50 Probably ISIS and Taliban beat incompetency of #Iran Islamist regime because they didn't control hundreds of billions in oil revenue that the world badly needs and pays for and didn't inherit an educated and mostly developed country like Iran.
1946 2018-06-19 19:50:48 Nobody is going touch that contract without the oil eating at least half of it, they still won't have d and no goalie after next year. McJesus is going to become another talent casualty of that joke of a franchise.
1947 2018-06-19 19:50:48 ياااااااااااااااااااااااااااااااارب
1948 2018-06-19 19:50:24 Possibly. Try reseaching CBD oil which is legal in the UK, it’s the non psychoactive chemical in cannabis.
1949 2018-06-19 19:50:21 Good to know!

(CBD oil works great for anxiety/stress too!)
1950 2018-06-19 19:50:21 Maybe Russia have just paid off some Fifa officials with oil profits to let them win the whole thing
1951 2018-06-19 19:50:08 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
1952 2018-06-19 19:50:03 abigail there’s a bit of oil that’s come on top it’s not exactly mouldy now is it
1953 2018-06-19 19:50:03 I remember Michelle Carter convicted of encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide. 
The actions of some of these groups are very similar in nature
1954 2018-06-19 19:50:02 Could coconut oil eh?
1955 2018-06-19 19:49:59 I was pose to get a oil change 3 weeks ago and now I’m finally here smh that’s sad
1956 2018-06-19 19:49:27 I'm pleased. You shouldn't waste your time with WrestleTalk now, it's clearly a sinking ship now they have that imposter in your place. Take your cod liver oil somewhere you'll be appreciated.
1957 2018-06-19 19:49:23 Them get oil too
1958 2018-06-19 19:49:10 i forgot to put oil in my hair b4 i went to work. kms

1962 2018-06-19 19:48:39 I met a guy on a course who may have survived stage 4 lung cancer because he made his own cannabis oil. Lung cancer has one of the lowest survival rates.
1963 2018-06-19 19:48:39 Pls where can one run a BOSIET course in Lagos? BOSIET is a 3days training related to oil rig safety @Gidi_Traffic @TrafficChiefNG
1964 2018-06-19 19:48:26 I don’t even get why the women declared the cannabis oil in her bag anyway. Or not stash it in her flange........ fucking amateurs.

1985 2018-06-19 19:45:40 Still hard to believe this snake oil salesman is president. It will be a joyous day when he has gone.

1990 2018-06-19 19:45:06 Wind and solar are currently bad investments. It's a big expense for a little gain. Now if oil ran out, sure it would be great, not with oil being king.
1991 2018-06-19 19:45:05 I can't imagine my life without coconut oil especially in winter

2179 2018-06-19 19:24:13 We looked at US #equity #valuations through a unique lens: how many ounces of #gold or #barrels of #oil would it take to “Buy” the S&P 500? It’s not as crazy as it sounds: the long run data (30 years) on these price relationships gives

2187 2018-06-19 19:23:25 Yes I am a believer but realize we still need oil  and coal. Carbon capture is great when it work properly. Just a lot less of it.  New green tech brings new good paying jobs. Never once said people have to stop living.  I do as much as I can to minimize my foot print.

And Canada IS racist. Especially against the indigenous natives that have a large presence.  Canada has allowed a tsunami of immigrants, but unlike USA issue, many are Asians buying up land, oil fields, and changing the natural beauty and culture, and economy.

2209 2018-06-19 19:20:32 Feather oil shreds their bread.
2210 2018-06-19 19:20:26 Let's see: given up my truck until the winter; boycotting palm oil; powering my house from renewables; switched to organic flour etc; allowing some of my land to go wild; leaving some timber to rot for beetles; encouraging bats in the roof space...
2211 2018-06-19 19:20:18 I have only one prayer for Nigeria, I hope God answers my prayer. I want renewable energies to displace fossil fuels in the future. I think when that happens and oil looses its value in the world market then our leaders would begin to make better economic decisions.
2212 2018-06-19 19:20:10 Can't tell if Russia's last two World Cup matches have been games of soccer or covertly brokered oil deals.

2220 2018-06-19 19:19:04 Sorry to say Trump is America without the self-promotion.

2225 2018-06-19 19:18:49 Agreed on the additives. He agreed too. But, this product is made to go in and clean out all the gunk and carbon deposits. You put it in and high rev the engine for 40 minutes or so to clean out the build up. Then check the filter and replace w/ oil and another to keep it going.

One litre of diesel is 15.4 NOK which is roughly 1.9 dollars
one litre is 0.26 gallons

so we pay ca 1.9*4=7.6 dollars per gallon

2291 2018-06-19 19:11:52 Cool n cool wipes. Coconut oil does wonders too!! I personally love coconut oil, one swipe and makeup is gone.

2295 2018-06-19 19:11:40 I saw that place when I was there working on an Oil Rig 20+ yrs ago...we often had a week off here or there, & I went adventuring with my Crew. It's breath-taking, as is much of the Architecture there!!

2298 2018-06-19 19:11:30 Next time I'm half asleep and get the bright idea to put orange oil in the bath, I'll just bathe in jalapeno juice instead.
2299 2018-06-19 19:11:20 Coconut oil is fab, makes your skin smell amazing and feel so soft! Removes make up then just wipe with a flannel 
2300 2018-06-19 19:11:14 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!
2301 2018-06-19 19:11:11 Eww no. Just stupid overpriced oil. Use Vaseline.
2302 2018-06-19 19:11:03 well, at least the empanadas wer estill crispy without being drenched with oil
2303 2018-06-19 19:10:55 Since the private oil companies were pushed out, oil production is way down.  The US has every incentive for production to be up, since our Houston boys profit from refining that extremely crude oil.  You have no idea what you're talking about.
2304 2018-06-19 19:10:49 Keep your license and registration handy...and your birth certificate, and your passport and your voter registration. And your tax returns. And your loyalty oath. And make sure your robe is clean and pressed. And you’ve got oil for your torches. And matches.

2312 2018-06-19 19:10:17 Soybean oil actually bottomed in August 2015 at 29.86, closed up from that in 2016.  Today prices dove to 27.79. Trade war possibilities working well -- if you're shorting. If you're producing soybean oil from soybeans -- you're fucked.
2313 2018-06-19 19:10:11 I don’t believe cannabis oil cures cancer but it certainly slows down the cancer cells from multiplying which then gives the cancer treatment a chance to work.
2314 2018-06-19 19:10:08 “You must be new here..” the line EVERY bitch uses when they’re being a bitch but don’t want to out themselves so publicly. And so ferociously. No, no one’s new; you’re just drowning in your sanctimonious bitch oil called Self Righteous Pompous Ass. It reeks btw. Bitchhhhhhhh....

2328 2018-06-19 19:08:24 That's a neat little supercharger! Looks like a fun little sleeper. Makes me wonder if that supercharger oil has been changed, the smell of that stuff is... Something you'll never forget.
2329 2018-06-19 19:08:12 lol  If you really believe this nonsense, then we live in different universes.  Even oil production is down since the Chavistas took it over.  The idea Maduro's opponents in private enterprise destroy their businesses to hurt him is absurd, and even self-contradictory.

2340 2018-06-19 19:07:17 I use rose hip oil if that's any help. Or Decleor stuff.

2405 2018-06-19 19:01:29 They can't govern. We know this. Look at Mexico and all its oil. there residents don't even get clean water. That's the problem in these places. Corruption rules. Pulled over for speeding, here's $50 forget about it. You need hospital treatment, ok, and if you can't pay it's jail
2406 2018-06-19 19:01:22 Market demands is the simple answer.  Some recycling is not financially prudent so waste collectors don't invest in the proper sorting and processing capabilities.  Recycling, batteries, used oil can all be curbside pickup here because it makes money.
2407 2018-06-19 19:01:14 And then there are all the health-nuts that are not allergic but want to cut gluten and this bread want to capitalize on that!

2443 2018-06-19 18:58:37 You probably didn’t know this, but the reason so many Latin American countries have gone to shit in the last several decades is because of a fun trend called Neoliberalism. It’s an economic philosophy that promotes privatizing national assets (like water and oil).

2448 2018-06-19 18:58:18 So if the tanker containing Metal Gear Ray was heading out to sea down the Hudson River... where did it START?

Is there a secret government development lab in Poughkeepsie? Albany? Schenectady?

Can an oil tanker even go that far up the river?

2463 2018-06-19 18:56:47 There’s an obscene amount of oil in US territories but we’ve legislatively restricted ourselves from exploiting it. Like, estimates of close to or greater than all of what Saudi Arabia has ever had + more. ANWR in Alaska alone is untouched & an enormous reserve.

2475 2018-06-19 18:56:00 The $ is lower due to the fact that it essentially became a 'petro -currency' under Stephen Harper (a 'high' $ hurts manufacturing & vice ,versa) 
Oil being @ half the $ it was during his tenure has greater impact than anything Polloz does ,but a lower $ will help manufacturing.

2488 2018-06-19 18:55:12 When I give my patients this advice I ALWAYS specify what kind of oil, because humans put the weirdest shit in their ears / body

2500 2018-06-19 18:53:44 There is video going around showing a boy being given cannabis oil while having a seizure. NEVER put anything into a person's mouth while they are seizing.  Do - remove dangerous objects, cushion their head, time the convulsions and stay with them while they recover. #Epilepsy
2501 2018-06-19 18:53:38 Maybe a bit more islands, found on the abandoned oil rigs or islands you find around the game, maybe even small animals like birds too. By giving them food, or other resources, they could possibly become a companion and help you do some basic or animal-only tasks.
2502 2018-06-19 18:53:37 it’s refurbished that I picked up from autozone. bearings look good and lubed up a bit with some oil already in it.
2503 2018-06-19 18:53:34 Totally agree - likely 100% having to do w/Midland basis.  That said, my broader point stands - if strong USD once again leads to lower benchmk oil px's to the point rigs begin to get laid down again, US ISM impact will likely be quick (should've been more exact in init tweet)

2509 2018-06-19 18:52:31 Step back a moment from this and see why the richest guy in the UK owns ineos , then think what he intends to do to iScotland now they own the North Sea oil pipeline.

They intend to hold iScotland to ransom , as well as the drillers.

So that leaves one option , Soverign OIL CO.

2512 2018-06-19 18:52:01 I always feel so liberated when i cut ties with Satan.  My anxiety is still there but i refuse to let it have control over my life.  Lavender oil & magnesium is doing wonders right now 
2513 2018-06-19 18:51:46 Not every street has a chemist. And not everyone has the kind of illness that can be controlled by cannabis oil.
2514 2018-06-19 18:51:42 So be it. Entire industries have been crushed before - slavery, Standard Oil, AT&T, asbestos, tobacco... if their practices pose a direct threat to the nation’s security, I’d say government intervention is not just appropriate, but a moral imperative.

2518 2018-06-19 18:51:23 Yes it should be legalised for medical use, my partner has cancer and I have her on RSO oil, and with proper research centres, we would be able to get the correct information, instead of trying to source this on the black market.

2527 2018-06-19 18:50:04 The Enbridge Energy pipeline in Minnesota will likely be shot down, as they want to replace the old one, to build a new one that will carry dirty oil sand sludge! Read it in the paper this morning, as even they have had enough of that crap in their backyard!

2531 2018-06-19 18:49:47 He needs an IV of olive oil or something.
2532 2018-06-19 18:49:46 There were environmental concerns as well. Lots of lakes in Quebec like Ontario and a substantial oil spill almost impossible to contain. Rail isn't trusted either since Lac Magantic. But personally, I think a transcanada highway route for a pipeline, was worth consideration.
2533 2018-06-19 18:49:34 I’ll see your Wing Commander IV and raise you a 3 Days of the Condor in which Robert Redford defeats Big Oil with the power of the New York Times.
2534 2018-06-19 18:49:34 Oil prices first went from 55 to 72.5 and the Canadian dollar did not move at all along with that. Meaning the Canadian dollar has been getting hammered independent of the move and oil price. Why? Because investors are leaving Canada becauseTrump lowered corporate tax rates
2535 2018-06-19 18:49:32 I'm really interested just wondering a few questions.
¿How can I be sure none of that fresh oil isn't gonna be on my carpet? ¿What if it's transmission increases with my leg?, it seems a good vehicle just answer my concerns to think about it. #lol 
2536 2018-06-19 18:49:31 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
2537 2018-06-19 18:49:17 US government are bunch of hypocrites. Their foreign policy in Nigeria revolves only around BIAFRA oil & gas resources; the gains they make from companies like Exxon Mobile or Royal Dutch She'll. They arm Buhari to massacre BIAFRANS & Christians. Their only value is oil wells.

2574 2018-06-19 18:45:09 Electric cars are still very much in the minority & it's perfectly sensible for it to be taxed to encourage uptake. (For health/environment)
It will be taxed eventually, but electricity generation & supply is far more efficient than mining & refining oil, so should stay cheaper.
2575 2018-06-19 18:45:00 I agree,  when oil prices get this high the whole economy hurts. I can always tell when my small business sees a decrease I know gas prices is up. Help us.

2577 2018-06-19 18:44:55 Also on #EnergyEast, lets not forget the ONLY reason that project failed was Trudeau’s imposition of carbon accounting on the pipeline project and oil shipped.

The Nigerian, Venezuelan and Saudi crudes used in Valero, Suncor and Irving refineries are not subject to this tax.

2809 2018-06-19 18:16:20 Same as my friends son, he was on Valproate Sulphate which is pure poison, as soon as CBD oil was sold in health stores she took him off it and switched to CBD he has a lot less seizures now and feels a lot better for it.
2810 2018-06-19 18:16:19 You better stop driving it until you figure out what’s wrong. They could have not tightened the drain plug and you may not have much oil in the engine. That’s why your car is jerking

2830 2018-06-19 18:13:32 Also, there's no such thing as "needed production". The sooner we phase out oil, the better off we'll all be. Less funding of terrorists, lower climate risk, and fewer health deaths from particulates, NOx, and other pollutants.

2837 2018-06-19 18:12:54 Low energy Jebby boy. Your big brother ruined the family name so far as politics are concerned. Stick to oil buddy boy. Besides the Saudis like you more then us Americans. Ps, nobody takes you seriously.
2838 2018-06-19 18:12:49 i have to get an oil change asap
2839 2018-06-19 18:12:45 We do drill for oil here. We can support ourself and not harm the environment at the same time. But someone has an aversion to solar and wind power. China will reduce its dependence on oil through solar in the next 10-20 years and will become the world power that the U.S. was.

2843 2018-06-19 18:12:14 So much money could go into the economy from legal cannabis/cannabis oil sales and we keep just letting it fly by. Fuck’s sake.
2844 2018-06-19 18:12:14 On  #NationalMartiniDay please do it right.  Gin is the proper choice of liquor.  Make it dirty!  Brine from garlic stuffed olives.  Garnish with bleu cheese stuffed olives (not soaked in oil).  After all, if you're going to do it, do it right!

2846 2018-06-19 18:12:03 My mechanic in Nome detailed every vehicle he worked on. When my truck would get ridiculous, I’d think - time for an oil change! 
2847 2018-06-19 18:12:02 The fact legalising cannabis oil is even up for debate is disgusting. 
Just fucking get on with it, who are the state to dictate what treatments people are or are not allowed to use.
2848 2018-06-19 18:11:57 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.

2854 2018-06-19 18:11:09 Is it time for an oil change?
2855 2018-06-19 18:11:07 UK is the worlds largest cannabis oil maker ..........BUT it’s illegal here. How utterly stupid. FFS make it legal. We are really a backward country.
2856 2018-06-19 18:10:56 My statement holds true even if oil demand is declining. Then it's a question of the amount. Even under stringent 2C scenarios, oil investment will be significant.
2857 2018-06-19 18:10:50 What on earth are you talking about. I made no comment about oil

2873 2018-06-19 18:09:30 @richieallenshow They wont legalise cannabis because people would then be able to make there own cannabis oil. The pharmaceutical industry wouldn't then be able to charge huge amounts selling drugs with cannabis oil in them.

2890 2018-06-19 18:07:22 I'd argue no. Pollusion/particulate matter created through diesel usage is harmful to everything - especially at a global usage scale. Also diesel is made from crude oil, crude oil spills are absolutely catastrophic to the environement and animals within.
2891 2018-06-19 18:07:17 Have you tried the CBD oil?
2892 2018-06-19 18:07:08 I am pretty sure but not certain that cannabis oil does not produce the High.I am not in favour of legalizing it for social purposes..seen too many people go wrong on it.

2897 2018-06-19 18:06:24 We are only dependant on oil because we have to fight the Left to allow us to drill oil in America. All the things that they say are bad, are really just because the Left makes us that way.

I support homosexual rights, I'd kinda like to not buy oil from places that murder them.
2898 2018-06-19 18:06:23 “When you have four or five oil companies it’s called a monopoly.”  Uh, no, Doug.  That's not called a monopoly.  
2899 2018-06-19 18:06:21 He might have a point there considering South Africa's Economic  structure in that regard including countries that do not produce oil. I've taken note especially over the many years South Africa and the world knows it converting coal in to fuel for cars.

2902 2018-06-19 18:06:09 We are all implicated in this because it's our money going to the Middle East for their oil.  That money is damaging our democracy and our political culture. All the more reason to take climate change seriously.

2912 2018-06-19 18:05:07 All good, Ms. McKenna, but as long as the #KinderMorgan pipeline expansion is still on the table, all this good work will be cancelled out by the expansion of the Alberta oil sands. The Paris targets are a minimum, but it is unlikely #Canada will even be able to meet those.

What is the cost of an expected oil spill?  Where is the spill cleanup factored into my gas price?  Time to pay up?

2916 2018-06-19 18:04:22 @RichieAllenShow main reason why they are dragging their feet on legalising canibus oil is that the criminal pharmaceutical cartels cannot patent a natural substance like canibus only chemicals made in a laboratory that do not occur naturally in nature.

2920 2018-06-19 18:03:29 Oral morphine is often prescribed for use at home by patients with chronic pain for them to use on an ‘as required’ basis. I don’t see why cannabis oil should be any different- it would be better for patients as it could be subject to proper quality control etc

2923 2018-06-19 18:03:20 I don’t believe cost(money) to be an issue here,this is the OIL RICH Nigerian govt we talking about here.. smaller plants =10,000 rather than 500,000 jobs and smaller output of end steel product which equals way less revenue

2951 2018-06-19 18:00:26 Problem is, the political elite and oligarchs have complete control over the valuable resources in Africa (diamond, gold, oil) and receive all the profits while everyone else suffers. If private business was allowed, you would see an increase in income and a decrease in poverty.
2952 2018-06-19 18:00:25 Seriously the best CBD oil out there !! And the more of the other amazing products I try the more I am impressed with HBN

2979 2018-06-19 17:57:42 I went to get an oil change. I jokingly said to the mechanic “you can switch my keys with that BMW’s” and he replied “nope. you’re a Ford Girl.” This was 4 weeks ago. I can’t stop thinking about it. WHAT DO YOU MEAN IM A FORD GIRL? I may drive to jiffy lube today I’ve had it
2980 2018-06-19 17:57:36 God takes care of me. 

He lights up the way before me, and I walk safely through the darkness...

God's friendship is felt in my home.

The Almighty is with me, and my children are around me.

My steps are awash in cream, and the rocks gush olive oil for me. So it be.
2981 2018-06-19 17:57:23 Where you getting your oil changed at— I’ll be sure to NEVER go there

2988 2018-06-19 17:56:32 With China the principal buyer of oil in a world of oversupply, why do they need dollars? In fact, they are negotiating oil purchases in everything but the dollar given their position. Given that they have a positive trade surplus ex-oil, why would they need dollars again?

2991 2018-06-19 17:56:26 If we in Canada are serious about climate change then ban the production of oil from the Oil Sands. No carbon tax is enough to give a pass to them on how they are destroying the environment.

2994 2018-06-19 17:56:09 Lol trust me my head shape is that bad  n yeah thankfully financial markets didn’t appear in the paper it was all about oil and OPEC and oil prices , I messed up a little bit which really annoys me but I guess what’s done is done , thanks for asking tho 
2995 2018-06-19 17:56:09 Yeah. Life is BAD when you are in the service and used in war by fat rich diplomats in DC who are making money off of oil rich countries.

3044 2018-06-19 17:50:52 So heartbreaking to see Alfie Dingleys mom saying that she goes to sleep every night not knowing if her son will wake up, I know this is how many people who live with loved ones with #epilepsy feel ... I hope the UK will allow the use of cannabis oil to all who it will benefit 
3045 2018-06-19 17:50:47 The thing that I don't understand Mexico is a beautiful country has all the natural resources that we do oil everything so why are people pouring out of there since the 70s it hasn't improved at all? It's going to be that way forever? Corrupt officials? law? Never to be fixed???
3046 2018-06-19 17:50:39 @ShopprsDrugMart Dear sales associate, I understand you must be following strict instructions to push one *featured* brand. I'm sure it's lovely. But it is not okay to exclusively push it despite my repeated assurance that $45 glorified coconut oil does not fix my severe eczema.
3047 2018-06-19 17:50:34 I use CBD cannabis oil, which is legal in the UK as it has none of the active THC compounds in it, it helps to relieve many of my health issues.
3048 2018-06-19 17:50:31 I thought the only difference was that cannabis oil has thc and cbd oil doesn't. Doesn't that mean cbd oil does same job without getting them high? Was reading about CBD Brothers in Suffolk and that's what I understood.

3058 2018-06-19 17:49:01 This tweet is outright trolling and lacks the basic data that shows that demand for oil will increase every year for decades. 

Is this statement a declaration that you will delay the completion by decades?

3078 2018-06-19 17:46:43 Actually, it’s the combination of cbd and thc (among several other beneficial cannabinoids) which most helps epilepsy sufferers. This is why the mothers of the sick kids in the news couldn’t just roll down to Holland & Barrett to get some CBD oil legally for their children.

3098 2018-06-19 17:43:51 Also Alha’s propolis foundation is goooooood. Not heavy at all, blends like a dream & my face’s not too oily. Just can’t use it with a silicone primer I feel. Else it’ll get patchy. Also using Too Faced’s powder so actually it might help w oil control idk tbh
3099 2018-06-19 17:43:46 exit crude oil 64.69
exit china mobile 44.38
3100 2018-06-19 17:43:25 Remember the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico which happened years ago.  Why did we urgently tried to contain it before it got out of hand ?  Our natural resources would have been destroyed & our environment would have been left in dire straits..... our society is at stake today !
3101 2018-06-19 17:43:12 Someone educate me.  Do you think the impending Tariffs proposed by the current administration have led to a false inflation of oil prices for fear that once in place these tariffs on steel will then crash the oil market? #America #YourThoughts #GoodOrBad
3102 2018-06-19 17:43:11 Its so sad to hear it from am african,, any way it suits your primitive intellectual....your oil VS those starving childrens....
3103 2018-06-19 17:42:47 Remember when I dropped that 80$ bottle of CBD oil and it shattered??? Yesterday my manager dropped one and it didn’t break and she said “thank god these don’t break”. So I just have really bad luck
3104 2018-06-19 17:42:44 Oil leak on the engine blah, blah, blah ...

3107 2018-06-19 17:42:22 Fibromyalgia is pretty terrible though but at least you’re optimistic! Lol I just don’t understand how it could be illegal, I think people hear CBD oil & think weed , even though they come from the same plants they’re very different, one gets u high & one doesn’t
3108 2018-06-19 17:42:22 Try to dry it out with tea tree oil or something lol
3109 2018-06-19 17:42:13 Jiffy lube. I use synthetic oil. 
3110 2018-06-19 17:41:56 Since you bring up Venezuela, if Trump wasn't so anti-immigration, we'd have immigration officials in Brazil interviewing former oil employees and asking if they'd like to work in the Permian Basin. What better way to hurt Venezuela economically, take their talent.
3111 2018-06-19 17:41:51 Conservatives and liberals, at their core, want to help when help is needed.  They just go about it differently.
Guy asks for help getting his oil changed.
Liberals will get someone to do his oil change.
Conservatives will teach him how to do the oil change.
3112 2018-06-19 17:41:44 With synthetic oil? Or regular?

3124 2018-06-19 17:40:41 "I support the repeal of Barack Obama's arbitrary restrictions on domestic energy exploration. I do not support drilling for oil off of South Carolina's coast.”  So @karringtonsc, you are ok with restrictions for exploration off SC’s coast then? Yes or No?

3126 2018-06-19 17:40:34 ongc an upstream company. ril is refinery and it has telecom retail etc  . in 2013-14 oil price was more than 100 $ per barrel. it is natural ongc would make huge profit as crude producer. crude is input for ril. its profit impeoved in lower crude price. both are opposite.

3128 2018-06-19 17:40:17 Companies used the tax cuts to improve infrastructure (ie: robotic means of eliminating employees) and stock buy backs. Investing in alternate energy would increase jobs that will work in the future, and reduce dependency on oil.

3132 2018-06-19 17:39:38 Real cool,  no oil ! Fumble fifingers stud strikes again!

3136 2018-06-19 17:39:21 Try and save a kid’s life with cannabis oil?
3137 2018-06-19 17:39:15 Definitely yes. I hate the thought of people suffering. Especially when there is no need for them to suffer if they could have access to cannabis oil.
3138 2018-06-19 17:39:13 CBD oil, even the strongest you can buy, doesn't have the same chemical composition as what is called cannabis oil which is currently illegal apart from some MS users who can get it on prescription.
3139 2018-06-19 17:39:02 Are o Gay this girl mare i think cooking oil will work
3140 2018-06-19 17:38:46 Shouldn't # 9 include renewables (e.g., solar), not just vehicles, to 'reduce oil dependence' ?
China is now # 1 producer/supplier of PV solar panels, both volume and generation efficiency.

3143 2018-06-19 17:38:43 I don't think so. Plenty of folks saw that it was all snake oil from the beginning. What is surprising is how many smart investors got sucked in.
3144 2018-06-19 17:38:42 I went to the car shop for a simple oil change. Apparently, my car had several issues and now I’m broke

3151 2018-06-19 17:37:22 Swings & roundabouts. Both have potential to kill, cause addiction & induce mental health probs so upgrade alcohol or downgrade cannabis. Also cannabis can apparently come in oil form w/o hallucinogenic chemical. Have no idea what the benefits & risks are of that.Needs testing
3152 2018-06-19 17:37:21 This says so much about what you value — Oil > children.   Locked in cages, you say nothing.  This isn’t oil week, this is humanity week.

3154 2018-06-19 17:36:54 @bbcsoutheast Your news today about women with terminal cancer from Gillingham treated at Medway....why not treat her with cannabis oil? Worth doing in my opinion.
3155 2018-06-19 17:36:53 @BlueRasberry For the last couple days I've been watching documentaries and reading up on Edgar Cayce. Just this weekend I came across a description of how to make his recommended castor oil pack and place it over the LIVER to detox. #Confirmation #Intuition
3156 2018-06-19 17:36:49 The only downside of not having a piece of shit car is I don’t want to change the oil so I have to sit in the dealership FOREVER waiting, it’s fine
3157 2018-06-19 17:36:44 Thanks! He's on trazodone but it wasn't working this morning. I've been doing the music and diffuser but I'll look into the cbd oil
3158 2018-06-19 17:36:37 I’m really happy for Alfie Dingley that he now has cannabis oil for his epilepsy. However I’m going to need his mother Hannah to either cry complete WITH TEARS or speak normally. Squeeze one out Thanks. #Epilepsy #CannabisAct #CannabisOil
3159 2018-06-19 17:36:18 Well, Canadian oil multiplies by 2.
3160 2018-06-19 17:36:07 That’s how I feel about my oil pan coming in the mail today  haven’t been able to drive my car
3161 2018-06-19 17:36:04 American oil companies (exporters) are withdrawing from an exporters meeting because an importer (who has offered to import more American oil) has retaliated to tariffs by imposing their own tariffs?

3164 2018-06-19 17:36:00 Or do they mean that they won't actually *need* to ban petrol and diesel cars, on account of the fact that there won't be any oil left by then anyway?

3172 2018-06-19 17:35:14 Hahahaha yeah!!! Bloody oil paint
3173 2018-06-19 17:35:11 India should further reduce Chinese imports & reduce crude oil dependency as #TradeWar escalate between China & America. India's infrastructure is gradually improving & domestic economy will be much stronger than ever by 2025. #USChinaTradeWar

3178 2018-06-19 17:34:44 Amen! Mine was brought on by emotional abuse in top of bad genetics.  CBD oil is magnificent! And I have to give a shout out to any therapy that moves old traumas. Acupuncture, Network Spinal Analysis, reikki..
All help as well. (Btw- CBD/THC bath salts are incredible!!)

3183 2018-06-19 17:34:16 It's all about the oil!
3184 2018-06-19 17:34:14 Nothing you ever say makes any sense. You start a sentence with apples and oranges and finish it with castor oil and milk of magnesia.

3205 2018-06-19 17:31:35 Oil works on all kinds of ailments and diseases. The lies and propaganda that's blackened its name for decades is outrageous. All so big phama can continue telling us what lab created medications are good for us to ensure the money keeps rolling in...for them 
3206 2018-06-19 17:31:16 The UN should slap 45 with crimes against humanity.  Try him, and lock the SOB up in a dark cell. Then, hang,draw and quarter him. If he is still wiggling,  place in a vat of hot oil.
3207 2018-06-19 17:31:12 Didn’t NASA find organic matter(methane) on mars last month? Now this month trump is creating a space force. Call me crazy but I think he thinks there’s oil out there

3210 2018-06-19 17:31:03 In all honesty, there is probably more than one saboteur within his company. The automobile industry and oil companies have a lot to loose with the success of Tesla. He would be the first innovator the industry has tried to eliminate.

3213 2018-06-19 17:30:57 It is too much. Lower the price of oil will increase the interest of the people about the govt.

3216 2018-06-19 17:30:40 .@margheritamvs This isn't new - every decade or so there is "Saudization" hoo-haa, then some oil plant/pump gets almost blown up (or something) & then it's "stay @ home, cheque in mail". I remember this in 90s Riyadh when in school. Massive expat cull & rehire shortly after.

3220 2018-06-19 17:30:13 It's such a shame what is happening to people and animals of your country! You have the biggest oil reserves in the world and yet people cannot benefit from that. 
3221 2018-06-19 17:30:11 Les Iverson FRS, who advised Home Office regards the 'license' granted to GW Pharma, will be able to confirm what I have stated. Truth is medical Cannabis Oil has already been legalised...but only when GW Pharma bottle & sell it.

3237 2018-06-19 17:28:21 Jesus dude. I can’t. Have you ever heard of mass oriented transit? Obviously the US was built as a transit desert. The oil and energy centered companies (also corrupt corporations) who pushed for the national defense highways ensured that.
3238 2018-06-19 17:28:18 it proves Russia and US are fighting for oil
3239 2018-06-19 17:28:16 Just drove from Seattle to South Carolina mid us and back the northern route. The fly over states are full of warm wonderful Americans. States are all beautiful. Southern Wyoming is full of oil wells but northern Wyoming was the most beautiful. Enjoy your trip
3240 2018-06-19 17:28:16 If you keep your engine compartment spotless it’s really easy to notice oil splatter or anything leaking.
3241 2018-06-19 17:28:10 @psgsr160  Vast American Majority aren't being misled. The problem is the GOP Congressional Members are still enabling Herr Comrade Dictator Trump & his parrot puppets believe every lie he tells them. They're a cult & he's the leader they drink too much of his Snake Oil Kool Aid
3242 2018-06-19 17:27:44 If this was really the problem why didn't you inform the people why did you wait for the oil prices to increase??
3243 2018-06-19 17:27:37 aww sue  she saw some kid at mariano’s last week & she said he was buying hemp oil & looked like you and i was like noooo i doubt it

3245 2018-06-19 17:27:26 I’m actually taking this long because I’m waiting for the oil paint to dry on my canvas
3246 2018-06-19 17:27:18 I couldn't agree more! Which is why I USE Lemon oil and snake oil to relax my inner being! It's a grass roots movement in the USA thats fighting the deployables!

3249 2018-06-19 17:26:45 Yeah protect it from the sun get some vitamin e oil
3250 2018-06-19 17:26:44 When one barrel of oil was &130 during 2012-2013 how the then UPA Govt could sell Petrol @₹62/65 per liter?
3251 2018-06-19 17:26:22 How long does it take to do an oil change? Not 2 hours!!!!!!
3252 2018-06-19 17:26:16 Trump is going to be seeking new alliances, including Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Russia as he alienates our allies of 70 years. Obviously Russia helped INSTALL him. How far will the partnership between Putin and Trump go? Biggest untapped oil reserves in Siberia. 
3253 2018-06-19 17:26:08 I’m covered in peanut oil
3254 2018-06-19 17:26:05 Eckington against fracking are all NIMBY’s think you need to get a life and realise that power needs to come from somewhere don’t see you complaining where your oil comes from
3255 2018-06-19 17:25:54 *calls tim at work for a step by step on how to check oil*
3256 2018-06-19 17:25:43 You're the idiot who doesn't know where the money to fund an OIL fund would come from.
3257 2018-06-19 17:25:37 It costs me 105 dollars just to get my oil changed in my car fml

3259 2018-06-19 17:25:09 Every time I’m out while it’s raining I miss the smell of rain in Australia- the combination of rain, dust and heat rising off the streets, and eucalyptus oil was the most comforting smell I’ve ever experienced

3266 2018-06-19 17:24:02 The one time I have done an activity with kids about climate change, it was specifically about oil spills, and I had them clean vegetable oil off of toys/feathers and see how hard that was to do.

3272 2018-06-19 17:22:56 He has plenty of reason to be paranoid. Imagine if you had the oil industry, automotive industry(GM, Daimler, VW), and the military industrial complex (ULA, Boeing, Lockheed) all gunning for you.
3273 2018-06-19 17:22:54 It's Kurt's stat but there are several possible sources: number of oil tanker movements, overall ship movements, number of cruise ships, etc. The point is that a few more oil tankers are negligible in the big picture except regarding the risk of oil spills (which are mitigated).
3274 2018-06-19 17:22:45 I was riding the crush but today got out, but just long beams, not shorting meal. Sold some puts in oil.
3275 2018-06-19 17:22:36 I actually was using some of the oil I made too that was knocking me tf out so it helped
3276 2018-06-19 17:22:34 ooooh I love body oil over lotion!
3277 2018-06-19 17:22:34 They kids people like me and kids Ritalin. Do you know what's in it? It's amphetamine refined. Not good for you, wee bit ganja in an oil based solution would be the ticket
3278 2018-06-19 17:22:26 In terminal conditions, if Cannabis Oil proves to be therapeutic when all other drugs fail, then so be it.
BUT it must be treated as a Class A drug of addiction.
Cannabis is a gateway drug and must never be decriminalised.

3281 2018-06-19 17:22:11 Rosneft is state owned oil company.....No idea why they're in the same bar, but the fact you're more concerned with why they were both there vs him bragging about having dirt from Russia on Hillary just proves the point.  No one knew P, you think they were watching him?
3282 2018-06-19 17:22:05 I just got some CBD oil for my dad for his arthritics and other age related maladies. Not sure if it's working yet but he's v excited about the *illegal drugs* aspect.
3283 2018-06-19 17:22:03 They use peanut oil for the chicken and stuff still but a manager told me they do use a different oil for fries now for a healthier alternative. Some stores are replacing sauces with "healthy" versions too
3284 2018-06-19 17:21:30 Good luck!! Eat at hope & try baking, uses less oil. Steam. Season while cooking not at the table. Be kind to yourself. It will be hard. You can do it!
3285 2018-06-19 17:21:20 We now export oil so...
3286 2018-06-19 17:21:18 Umm it has changed from 68.5 in 2014 to 68.7 in 2018. At best, new debt has been offset. Low crude oil to the rescue? Why do you have to oversell everything? Maybe because nothing *really* has lived up to the scale of the pitch made in 2014?
3287 2018-06-19 17:21:14 ok my mom owe me almost rm90 and im that poor so i asked her to pay it back lol but i'll ask her to buy me hada labo cleansing oil instead ok dah confirm dah

3303 2018-06-19 17:19:17 Great discussion right now at MN PUC about dangers of Line 3 being off line & having to move oil on rail.  MN Farmers remember commodities rotting a few years back as our elevator partners were unable to get rail cars.  Support MN farmers & replace Line 3 down preferred route!
3304 2018-06-19 17:19:07 Was in a meeting earlier and Lady #1 tells lady #2 her role in the project is the lubricant and someone from the back says water based or oil.  I wanted to die right there.
3305 2018-06-19 17:19:06 Oh yes! Tell you what, this CBD oil (the week version of the cannabis oil) at 2% is already doing wonders. 2 weeks in & up to 2x 3 dogs a day I feel I don't really miss the patches. Next I'll get the 5% (Amy is using a 7% & loves it!)
3306 2018-06-19 17:19:06 Give me cannabis oil over Ritalin any day of the week
3307 2018-06-19 17:19:02 Actually I think it was asked without mentioning funding. She asked about working with oil companies rather than sponsorship

3310 2018-06-19 17:18:42 This cannabis oil debacle just looks to me like a publicity scam for the Tory government.
3311 2018-06-19 17:18:35 Catherine if your war on Oil And Gas companies is so important why will you not tell us what it will cost us?

Why did your government exempt a Quebec LNG project but block Emergy East and Morther Gateway.

You are corrupt and using carrots and sticks to influence voters
3312 2018-06-19 17:18:27 Guess you @FraserInstitute didn’t hear about the huge drop in the price of oil.. whatever it is you are peddling with this story, people should not be concerned as with all your ultra conservative Koch Brothers propaganda is getting real stale .. #BCpoli
3313 2018-06-19 17:18:26 Oil and filter change if it’s a Vauxhall
3314 2018-06-19 17:18:03 There is always a period of time between the production of coconut oil and its use. Over time, the oil loses its biological strength. The "Tear of the Buddha" is devoid of this defect. The resulting oil, which has potent biological activity, is immediately used.#SuperFoods
3315 2018-06-19 17:17:59 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.

3317 2018-06-19 17:17:42 Me: going to get an oil change

Dad: ok. Are you ready? They will try to sell you other things. Say NO. They will tell you it’s urgent. It’s not. They will offer you everlasting life. It’s a racket. Stay strong. You’ve been trained to deal with this.

3319 2018-06-19 17:17:22 Thanks for putting up with me and giving me oil!
3320 2018-06-19 17:17:20 Yes US advisor said  cannabis oil should be made available as CBD oil in UK which of course it already is. And the whole high potency 'skunk' myth is akin to the Reefer Madness narrative.

3323 2018-06-19 17:17:02 Why bring the habs into that hot oil spill?  Each of the trades mentioned are still up for debate for the habs. As for oil, it's pretty conclusive.
3324 2018-06-19 17:17:02 @SecretaryZinke You are destroying our protected lands all in the name of big oil.  You deserve to be impeached along with the entire R party; the party of corruption.

3330 2018-06-19 17:16:13 The headlines are nice but the article copy undercuts your point:

"Ultimately, drought and flooding have a more significant impact on farms. Low oil prices could also offset any impact of the worker shortage."

3337 2018-06-19 17:15:36 Real question I ask myself is why dems supported trump boosting his military, spying powers, oil drilling, immigration (Obama set the record)etc. & the fact Russia is being used to silence progressive voices that speak out against corps. Neo liberalism will bring down ur country
3338 2018-06-19 17:15:24 She May have been subdued by the fumes from the cannabis oil...
3339 2018-06-19 17:15:24 I bet oil does need to go higher
3340 2018-06-19 17:15:24 Yeah, if you can kindly keep your DoTerra snake oil away from me. That would be awesome. Thanks! Lol
3341 2018-06-19 17:15:06 Panel to study Cannabis Oil's efficacy? GW Pharma CURRENTLY use FULL EXTRACT Cannabis Oil re legally available Sativex (1:1 CBD & THC) & Epidiolex (100% CBD). A simple lit./trials data review pls otherwise ur delay is HARMING KIDS.
3342 2018-06-19 17:15:01 Still employing the old "say it often & loudly enough, people will believe the bull".  Well nope, it's not going to work at this  point in  history. Most of us have learned. Trump can always count on  MAGAts to  buy the  snake oil he's selling, but don't count on the rest  of us
3343 2018-06-19 17:14:54 What a time to reveal this mathematics, what about first three year's income collected by NDA Govt, when crude oil was on 30$/brl
3344 2018-06-19 17:14:49 Not an entire range, but there’s a few that don’t have a fragrance in.. “Perfume” on a label is often an essential oil, industry demands we call it perfume.

Then again Lush is all about scents, so..  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

3367 2018-06-19 17:12:05 Today a call from a cell phone costs you 0.5 ps per minutes and the price of oil is almost Rs 100 / litre. So,there’s a paradoxical situation wherein, luxury comes cheaper than basic needs. i.e. the common man and the ones on & below the poverty line
3368 2018-06-19 17:11:51 Haha next up, oil, Derek probably tell me to fire fucking brake fluid in there too 
3369 2018-06-19 17:11:44 My son is autistic and has adhd. He takes medicine daily for this which I despise him being on. It affects his appetite and behaviour. I would love to try him on canabis oil and see if this helps his conditions. How do I apply? Also, legalise canabis and you’ll end gang war 2/2

3372 2018-06-19 17:11:32 I pulled video footage of every President since Ronald Reagan talking about future plans for NASA & Human Space Exploration & you can just tell in 1996 that something major changed & the Military & Oil Industrial Complex was gonna cram Mars dirt down everyones throat for 20 yrs.

3375 2018-06-19 17:11:04 Many guys on that team declined fast: Buckner, Rice, Geddy, Oil Can. They were an older team & just caught lightning in a bottle in '86, though Oil Can & Geddy weren't old. Geddy was never the same after his holdout/collusion in 87; Oil Can had injuries, among his other problems.

3378 2018-06-19 17:10:40 There is no single Mediterranean diet. Though pretty much in all countries around the Mediterranean, there was & is consumption of fish & pork. Pastured raised pork can b up to 60% oleic fatty acid. What's olive oil? Around 70% oleic fatty acid. Very little consumption of PUFU's
3379 2018-06-19 17:10:34 Same thing going on in Sweden....must be some kind of bribe? Oil in Syria, pipeline from Kurdiland trough Syria to Europe? Lundin Oil Company in Kurdistan (Isis-bribe)? Ryssia threat, Putin friendship with Assad? No good for Europe. Why electric cars so hot in EU? Blame Russia!

3389 2018-06-19 17:09:53 Still employing the old "say it often and loudly enough and people will believe".  Well, nope, it's not going to work at this point in history.  Most of us have learned. Trump can always count on MAGAts to buy the snake oil he's selling, but don't count on the rest of us.
3390 2018-06-19 17:09:48 The guy at the shop who help do my cars oil change was smoother than the cream cheese on any bagel I’ve ever had. The world needs more nice and smooth people like him. Not my world.. but I’m sure someone’s world.

3411 2018-06-19 17:07:35 I’m not a doctor but if we use derivatives of opiates and cocaine for medicinal purposes, then why not cannabis oil?
3412 2018-06-19 17:07:34 Why does it cost Draisaitl for Oilers but then from Vegas it’s only Cody Glass and a 2019 1st round pick and Theodore (rumoured but still). Imo an offer of Klefbom, 10th and Puljujarvi or something is a better offer. But obviously this becomes moot if he does have Oil on his NTC
3413 2018-06-19 17:07:27 With all you knowledge and power! Show me evidence of someone who has overdosed on cannabis and I MEAN CANNABIS ALONE?
Not crack and other shit in there system. Cannabis alone!!!!!! 
There’s been no one people. That’s the truth.

3418 2018-06-19 17:07:00 Sorry, you got it backwards. He who produces the product has the leverage. They give us product and we give them IOU's used for oil.

I also understand that many suffering from cancer also find it helpful.

3427 2018-06-19 17:06:08 it might.

The process soap goes through to become soap probably has something to do with it too. Since we're changing the chemical make up of the oil.

I just add shea butter to my soap. ^_^ which is moisturizing.

3503 2018-06-19 16:56:57 @JasonGregor @Jason_Strudwick, we are pledging to join the #500squat Challenge.  The Leduc Besties Keith, Dave & Taylor.  We are 20% in and want to quit already.

3504 2018-06-19 16:56:40 Love how he put motor oil in his ear
there's MULTIPLE oils in this world say something like lube or vegetable oil or some thing just...why motor oil
3505 2018-06-19 16:56:38 Haha, right, you're too busy with fictional fascism to deal with the real thing.

I didn't know you could be gullible and a snake oil salesman at the same time. Learn something new every day.
3506 2018-06-19 16:56:07 Oil pastels are fun to do as a base for oil paint too.  
Great stuff btw.
3507 2018-06-19 16:55:59 Commissioner General KRA & MD KEBS should resign or be forced to for allowing Contraband commodities into the market .Sugar,Oil to mention a few !
3508 2018-06-19 16:55:02 Of the 100 million barrels per day consumed worldwide, Canada supplies 2.8M. If we withhold supply, all that happens is that importing countries buy their oil somewhere else. If someone buys all their groceries at their local Safeway, and it shuts down, they won't starve.
3509 2018-06-19 16:54:44 But also we gotta remember to take breaks and do things for ourselves so the bad news doesn’t just depress us.

For example, I oil paint now.
3510 2018-06-19 16:54:44 Do not adjust, clean, or oil moving machinery. #BaffinSafety
3511 2018-06-19 16:54:39 #isitok cannabis oil is banned by people who have no clue what it's like for disabled people who have to live in chronic pain @TheLastLeg - get back to me :)
3512 2018-06-19 16:54:33 I used a lemongrass body oil this morning for my dry skin and to (allegedy) help wake me up. Now I am wandering around the house, still exhausted but smelling like a freshly polished dining room table.
3513 2018-06-19 16:54:28 So the POTUS will need to invoke some sort of Security concern to push his Tariff. I hope Congress does their job. The only trade deficit is on the Canadian side that ships 40% of US oil, that is what Trump is trying get money to Russia for oil trade.
3514 2018-06-19 16:54:27 I smoke it for my dystonia because the oils are just too strong. If I smoke it I can have a little so the superficial twisting undoes then gradually have more as the untwisting gets deeper. If it were legal I’d be able to source an oil that would be ideal for dose control
3515 2018-06-19 16:54:24 In response to the demand for reducing excise duty on oil he asks d people to pay taxes honestly. So he believes that all Indians except him r dishonest.Can anybody point out just one good thing he did to India in last 4 years?
3516 2018-06-19 16:54:07 Coconut oil. Raspberry seed oil. Carrot seed oil. Avocado oil. They all have SPF
3517 2018-06-19 16:53:54 I use my massage oil for EVERYTHING!  need an egg butty - got some oil for that.  Need to lubricate a rusty hinge - got some oil for that. Hands feel a bit cracked - got some oil for that. Occasionally even massage with it 
3518 2018-06-19 16:53:46 Just because something is legal and available, does not by any means indicate that it is scientifically proven.

Homeopathy pills can be bought in most pharmacies, they have zero evidence base.

Same as most snake oil remedies.
3519 2018-06-19 16:53:35 I see the Koch Brothers are in the news again, spending money to block efforts that reduce oil consumption, like transit and bike lanes.

Suckers. Most American cities do that for free. Car culture is an area where radical right meets "progressivism" in a perfect venn diagram.
3520 2018-06-19 16:53:12 $WTI oil shorts need Crazy Don to speak twice a day about trade war while the markets are open with no prepared marks and just a lunatic word salad stream of consciousness blast. Thanks. #Blessed
3521 2018-06-19 16:52:59 We’ve occupied foreign countries for oil & occupied foreign countries for better military stances. Why not occupy foreign countries that aren’t taking care of their families, allow them to be sold into slavery, & where cartels run amuck? #KeepFamilesTogether
3522 2018-06-19 16:52:34 .@EdmontonOilers & @StLouisBlues News: Things are picking up around the #Oilers right now, a few things are being talked about like all teams are doing but the Oil are very active in getting a right shot D

3525 2018-06-19 16:51:57 A simple and safe facial routine:

1. Spread 3-4 drops Avocado Oil (Virgin Carrier Oil) on your clean face, followed by aloe vera gel (moisturizing) before sleep
3526 2018-06-19 16:51:57 He is a straight up old school snake oil salesman...you people just happen to be an easy sell...
3527 2018-06-19 16:51:32 reaching the point of not flinching when the oil/fat in the pan flies up and hits your hand at the cost of burning myself
3528 2018-06-19 16:51:30 Fun fact: the first commercial oil well in America was in PA.
3529 2018-06-19 16:51:30 then after that use coconut oil to moisturize the shit out of it. trust me i’m pale as fuck and am an expert in sun burns LMAO
3530 2018-06-19 16:51:29 Big oil - your Sugar-Daddy Koch - pays U, Tori, to keep TN dependent on them. Your work diminishes #Freedom. Young people in TN who don't have a car are less free and more dependent on others because you helped kill the expansion of buses/trains which was an expansion of #Freedom

3532 2018-06-19 16:51:18 《オリーブ油豆知識》

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
3533 2018-06-19 16:51:14 China doesn’t have the same luxury as Russia. Russia sells oil for Euros/dollars & swaps oil for gold with China. China needs the dollars to conduct trade as long as no one wants to hold Yuan & as their trade balance shrinks.
3534 2018-06-19 16:51:01 I’m getting some service on my car today and they gon ask me if I knew my side mirror was broken like I ain’t the one who been pressing it back on every time it fall off. Just change that oil and rotate them tires fam #MindYaBusiness
3535 2018-06-19 16:50:56 またお願いしやす( ^ω^ )
3536 2018-06-19 16:50:56 I wonder if the coconut oil replaces our own body’s oil and thusly creates the dryness as it itself evaporates/is absorbed
3537 2018-06-19 16:50:33 The only way they can export is because they get cheap Canadian oil to help fill domestic needs. Is it any wonder who has the most to gain by keeping our energy landlocked.
3538 2018-06-19 16:50:32 Oil - WTI US OIL has topped expect we will test the mid $50 level and over time, after counter trend rallies, over time, Oil will retest its lows and break through into the low $20 level. Unleaded Gas will follow

3540 2018-06-19 16:50:22 I'm not afraid of anyone in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre because they don't use proper PPE while operating their saws, always cold start the saws, and never once check their bar oil. That sort of carelessness makes me think they're much more likely to injure themselves than me

3545 2018-06-19 16:49:49 Yea now I can appreciate why my Nana wore an apron while cooking. I have oil burns on my legs. 
3546 2018-06-19 16:49:46 Legalise cannabis oil bunch of twats who call themselves parliament and leaders of this country. If one of your family members ever gets it you’ll be fighting for their right to live, so give people the right to live and the chance to spend more time with their family
3547 2018-06-19 16:49:41 The cat is cleaning the oil from your fingers off its fur. The oil makes the fur heavier, and the cat can feel the difference between the petted and non-petted fur, because of the oils.
3548 2018-06-19 16:49:31 Sure. And we really only worried about human rights in countries with oil or a strategic location we could use to bomb brown people....
3549 2018-06-19 16:49:22 Pretty sure he asked if we were to have an oil fund where would the money come from :)
3550 2018-06-19 16:49:15 What about housing, oil and nafta?
Can you elaborate?

3552 2018-06-19 16:49:12 One good thing I have discovered this week, there is a light at the end of the tunnel when you are trying to achieve something. Been trying to get a new car for awhile now. Looks like that might happen in Sept! My car is 2004 & burning oil. Time for upgrade!
3553 2018-06-19 16:48:58 Exercise Exercise Exercise.... and also a coffee scrub and the bramely tissue oil
3554 2018-06-19 16:48:58 Smoking anything is harmful for your body. Smoking is not the only way nor the most popular way to ingest marijuana, THC, or CBD. There are oil, edibles, pills, topical ointments, etc... all with outstanding positive effects and very few side-effects.
3555 2018-06-19 16:48:49 Been trying to turn the chicken that's frying in the frying pan and the oil keeps jumping and burning my hand 
As Gershom would say, this is not the hill I want to die on.
3556 2018-06-19 16:48:41 Use olive oil to get them off
3557 2018-06-19 16:48:38 1. Trillions of dollars in welfare to corporate welfare queens - coal, oil, prescription drugs, banks, Nestle, Comcast, etc.  Great Depression suicides by bankers, others - some jumped out of buildings.  Insane deregulation after Savings and Loan Crisis and depraved indifference

3560 2018-06-19 16:48:34 d told me you was hot , because ma made your oil change appointment early this morning 
3561 2018-06-19 16:48:17 That’s great, thank you. Oil sounds pawsome to mummy as she has IBS and has read some magnesium supplements can affect tummy. Someone had said about bath salts but mummy doesn’t fit it many baths so oil after a shower and before bed sounds purrfect. Thank you 
3562 2018-06-19 16:48:05 I know you think you sound logical, but you've been repeatedly lied to by this administration (this is beyond dispute) and you'd rather remain uninformed than admit you were duped. I don't waste my time dealing with that.
3563 2018-06-19 16:48:01 It caused inflation, not the inflation of the seventies, which was caused by 'easy money' policies. If not, the inflation would have ended when North Sea oil was found and the OPEC price collapsed. It ended when 'tight money' caused unemployment, high interest rates.
3564 2018-06-19 16:47:38 I read the book from the dude who started Shell, itäs mentioned there, that they just burned away all the gas pockets, because it was seen as a waste product and general hindrance to pumping oil. Must have been the greatest waste of ressource and a huge blow for the environment.
3565 2018-06-19 16:47:35 I feel like a women that only wanted they oil changed 
3566 2018-06-19 16:47:30 Endangered Orangutans are the most effected, and the massive use of Palm Oil could lead to their extinction! Palm Products are used in Oreos, Nutter Butters, different cookies, even the @Pillsbury Cresent Rolls have Palm Oil. (I was so sad!)

3568 2018-06-19 16:47:19 2- Abu Khattab al-Iraqi, the network's leader, managed revenue generation through the illicit sale of oil and gas. The other three men killed, Abu Yusuf al-Hashimi, Abu Hajir Milhim, and Abu Hiba al-Maghrebi, facilitated these operations.

3578 2018-06-19 16:46:07 Mix oil with your foundation & thank me later
3579 2018-06-19 16:46:03 Is it just a cows milk intolerance? So goats/sheep etc would be okay? If so then cheeses and stuff should still be okay (ie instead of Parmesan use pecorino, instead of mozzarella use BUFFALO mozzarella etc) some cheaper pastries use palm oil instead of butter, you can use...
3580 2018-06-19 16:45:52 I would suggest to stay away from #PalmOil . Even though its Plant Based, Companies like @Nabisco cut down acres apon acres of trees for Palm Oil Plantations. Because Palm Oil is used in SO many things, its a huge cause of deforrestation.
3581 2018-06-19 16:45:24 Looking at the schedule, we have a few openings for this week...do you need an alignment? Brakes? Check engine light? Front end work? Tires? Air conditioner work? Oil Change? Tire rotation? We can help! Give us a call! 785-336-2828

3584 2018-06-19 16:45:11 Do you use motorcycles, lawn mowers, chainsaws, pumps or weed trimmers? You’ll need a two-cycle oil to lubricate the engine parts no matter if it’s running or not. It’s a must for all hand-held power tools, but as always, be sure to check your manufacturer’s recommendations!

When a leg formation is non-confirming but secured, a truncation would have occurred. A truncation is a bullish sign during a downtrend and bearish for an uptrend.
3586 2018-06-19 16:45:05 Ah I wondered when we'd see your cartoons (that's your "tell" for when you're frustrated).

Do the arithmetic on your claims-they don't add up.

Let's be clear-oil is GOOD. Oil is POSITIVE. Oil is however not a credible basis for reliance in terms of sustainable revenue source.

3591 2018-06-19 16:43:58 Hi Tam long  long time pal  yeah still in Inverness all family doing well Are you still in the oil business ? Hope you’re good : @CBFG
3592 2018-06-19 16:43:57 They still do that to paved roads in PA. It’s a cheaper fix than repacking. The oil gets all over your car and doesn’t come off. And if that weren’t enough they spread little rocks all over it that make roads unsafe for motorcyclists. Like riding on gravel
3593 2018-06-19 16:43:52 And don’t forget the oil tariff

3621 2018-06-19 16:41:01 CBD is your friend for those issues. I went from restless sleep to peaceful. And one time I was having a full blown anxiety attack, smoked some CBD bud (smoke is the fastest delivery but I prefer oil) and it ended in less than 5 minutes. CBD for mental illness seems to be best

3626 2018-06-19 16:40:50 Had a good head-massage with oil, dinner too; leaving for Punjabi Bagh for a dessert.

Surely the last trip for the day.
3627 2018-06-19 16:40:49 You should try motor oil either way
3628 2018-06-19 16:40:28 ウルフもハイエナも事情があるんだって
3629 2018-06-19 16:40:16 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！
3630 2018-06-19 16:40:05 @Cristiano 
You are getting younger with age
where most of the players retired
at 33 you are still at the peak of 
your game.
Kindly add two of most favorite
Honey & Olive oil in your diet too
to play at least 2026 world cup.
Thanks.
3631 2018-06-19 16:40:05 instructions unclear, ear drowned in motor oil
3632 2018-06-19 16:40:04 Obviously it involves the exchanging of oil, cranking nuts and bolts, the factories have achieved complete automation, plus these are self-driving cars at that
3633 2018-06-19 16:40:03 Used motor oil is carcinogenic, isn't it?
3634 2018-06-19 16:40:02 Last year oil was approx $50.00 a barrel this year its closer to $80.00 a barrel. It’s math not ideology that drives these prices.
3635 2018-06-19 16:40:02 My moms coworker eats that shit no cheese no sauce.  Straight bread olive oil and toppings.  Wtf is the point.
3636 2018-06-19 16:39:59 wow i don’t fucking deserve you at all  i love you baby!!! tysm but what if we go to lunch instead?? fuck my oil change
3637 2018-06-19 16:39:58 หูฟังของพี่เจบีนิค่ะ 
3638 2018-06-19 16:39:57 Hey @kenjilopezalt - What is your best advice on Olive Oil?
3639 2018-06-19 16:39:51 antoni, i defended your lack of knife skills to everyone and you repay me by putting truffle oil in poke
3640 2018-06-19 16:39:40 Haha Lucas synthetic oil stabilizer  good for older engines;)
3641 2018-06-19 16:39:35 Russia, Saudi push for big hike in oil output despite Iran opposition: VIENNA/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia and Saudi Arabia are pushing OPEC and its allies to raise oil output steeply from July to meet growing demand and cover supply outages in Venezuela and Libya despite…
3642 2018-06-19 16:39:29 ...fucking 'establishment'....Hemp was the natural product that the oil barons and car manufacturers and steel magnates got banned......all for greed....BASTARDS...

Don’t use baby oil too as you might get pregnant.
3646 2018-06-19 16:39:24 作業時間が足りぬぬぬぬぬぬ！！！
3647 2018-06-19 16:39:19 @Q13FOX just did a super Bing bong hit using oil
3648 2018-06-19 16:39:17 Yes I have noticed increased prices, but I also noticed price increases after utilities were privatised, price increases occur regardless of whether brexit happens, other factors have a role in that such as oil cost etc, yes I believe brexit will impact the UK negatively too
3649 2018-06-19 16:39:12 Even if this was true correlation is not always causation. For example, Trump Vodka was discontinued due to lack of sales and oil production skyrocketed. Trump vodka going out of business didn’t make us better at getting oil out of the ground.
3650 2018-06-19 16:39:07 Never mind lavender oil for this exam give me CBD oil 
3651 2018-06-19 16:39:06 So we may not achieve the target on all major #oil infrastructure projects by 2020 with the GoU saying may be 2021 these extensions bannage. @radioone90fm #radioonespectrum @Bit20200
3652 2018-06-19 16:39:03 who the hell would think to use motor oil
3653 2018-06-19 16:39:03 bored af waiting for this oil change
3654 2018-06-19 16:39:01 >motor oil
3655 2018-06-19 16:38:55 The lady sitting next to me to get our oil changed just said “there’s the remote, I have been looking for days”

She literally has a Mary Poppins purse and just loses stuff in it all the time I guess!
3656 2018-06-19 16:38:53 mhm. same kitchen where i shattered a glass bottle of olive oil on the tile (the grout was NEVER the same) & ran regular dish soap in the dishwasher. ALSO where i tripped my kid sister when we were running for cookies and she hit her forehead on the fridge & needed stitches.
3657 2018-06-19 16:38:47 Maybe with Salah in, Egypt will look a bit better, but it certainly looks like the whole of African futbal, suprisingly,  has regressed in the past 10 years. Tunisia and Saudi could barely kick the ball.
3658 2018-06-19 16:38:34 Ever since I got my oil changed, my engine light had been on and off. Someone remind me to get it checked tomorrow morning.

3662 2018-06-19 16:37:55 doctor: to loosen up your earwax you should sleep with some oil in your ear canal

doctor: not motor oil though. i forgot to specify once and now one of my clients is deaf

3673 2018-06-19 16:36:57 At least it looks like we can use the oil without getting nicked.
3674 2018-06-19 16:36:51 Prolly low levels and if it's more than 15-20 minutes away I wouldn't Risk it, turn the car off take a napkin or 3 and check your oil

Caller “Ive never used recreational drugs”
Me “caffeine? alcohol?”
C “thats completely different..”
M “so youve never used cannabis?”
C “Ive taken cannabis oil for years for a touch of lumbago, that brufen doesnt touch; but Id never use ‘drugs’, I’m not a junky!”
3676 2018-06-19 16:36:11 We are definitely tea people! We love Earl Greys that use natural bergamot oil!
3677 2018-06-19 16:36:08 Might get out the coconut oil, if you catch my drift.
3678 2018-06-19 16:35:48 Yesss! I only use cruelty free products and have tons of recommendations! Currently I alternate between by Giovanni Brazilian Keratin & Argan Oil Shampoo and Eva NYC Clean It Up Shampoo. Between washes, I use Amika's Perk Up Dry Shampoo or the Eva NYC Freshen Up Dry Shampoo.
3679 2018-06-19 16:35:43 Venezuela is a failed socialist country.  Something you crazy liberals are trying to do here in the U.S.  How can an oil rich country be so poor?  Corruption at every level.  Citizens starving.  Yeah, socialism in action....
3680 2018-06-19 16:35:35 I don't know why they ever stopped. Correct me if I'm wrong, but oil comes from the ground, does it not?
3681 2018-06-19 16:35:15 Unfortunately the doctors told me straight  they can't cure it. What ever they give you is only managing it to ease the discomfort.  I recently discovered applying coconut oil  help a few days ago.
3682 2018-06-19 16:35:13 Hi Shireen, I'm really sorry that you lost out of £5 when you paid for your sunflower oil in our store a few days back. I have called the store and spoke with the Duty Manager and he has asked to talk to you about this himself. 1/2
3683 2018-06-19 16:34:49 เพื่อนก็แย่ละ เกนเอ้ยยย #อวทกว
3684 2018-06-19 16:34:42 US now is an exporter of oil for the first time, soon not needing our oil anymore.  God help us here in Alberta. @RachelNotley is right in the sense that we need to get our oil to other markets, sooner rather than later.
3685 2018-06-19 16:34:31 For dry skin, use a mixture of baby oil and epsom salt. Rub into skin then shower.
3686 2018-06-19 16:34:18 Or what. Higher taxes for oil exchange in Deir Ezzor ?
3687 2018-06-19 16:34:15 Agreed. It needs explaining to the public, in clear terms, that cannabis oil under medical direction is not equivalent to having a spliff!
3688 2018-06-19 16:33:59 Oil. What? I like it’s smell.
3689 2018-06-19 16:33:54 Y aurait il une épidémie de diarrhée rue Compans?............

I’m really concerned that well-meaning people are spreading false hope for a drug which may not actually live up to expectations.
3694 2018-06-19 16:33:20 This oil change is taking too long 
3695 2018-06-19 16:33:18 They prolly didn't close it right and it's leaking or put enough oil in there smh
3696 2018-06-19 16:33:18 But we're talking about a scenario where the Soviets aren't involved in the war, so the point about the oil fields in the Caucasus is irrelevant. Plus, even if the Germans had control over the fields, it's not like they would be able to defeat the US and the UK.
3697 2018-06-19 16:33:16 Canadian ethical oil. We're not perfect but we are certainly a hell of a lot better!
3698 2018-06-19 16:32:55 Loll and that's perfectly fine! I think the oil and the smell are just disgusting lmfao
3699 2018-06-19 16:32:53 $25 dollars gets you an amazing 16oz of olive oil

3704 2018-06-19 16:32:24 When I was a kid in mid 60s, the state & county got rid of used motor oil by spraying it on dirt roads to keep the dust down.
3705 2018-06-19 16:32:17 The lever in my toilet cistern has rusted so won't always flush. Couldn't find my WD40 then remembered... I rub rusty old joints for a living! Massaged in some almond oil et voila! Working just fine  #MagickHands

3711 2018-06-19 16:31:11 He literally did vote against an assault weapons ban, that's a fact. You don't have to make random personal attacks at me. You also didn't address why your husband voted to take away native Americans lands at behest of the oil companies.
3712 2018-06-19 16:31:09 Stopping all single-use plastics not only helps save the oceans it also decreases demand for oil & gas
3713 2018-06-19 16:31:06 Now I am very concerned about anything that is about ‘legalising ‘ drugs but to deny cannabis oil to a poorly child is to me outrageous
3714 2018-06-19 16:31:01 Gotta learn how to take care of a car before you jump into an expensive one. I ran my old Cavalier into the ground in high school not keeping up with the oil and fluids, can't imagine if I'd done that on a $60K car lol

3716 2018-06-19 16:30:33 That and oil and access to oil and dominance of the market. #MIC all line up behind that and weapons sales. The ideology simply facilitates exploitation.

3719 2018-06-19 16:30:24 Castor oil means no need to  no? 
3720 2018-06-19 16:30:06 Wind and solar are for power generation, so they do not replace oil. About 70% of all oil produced is used for transportation fuel. Renewables are good projects, but they don't us off of foreign oil. T. Boone Pickens #invest #Oil

3730 2018-06-19 16:29:02 As well as cannabis oil for medical use, there was also a discussion about legalising marijuana. Of course CBD should be available right now - the stories of unnecessary suffering are awful - but if you don't like the smell, it really is anti-social in some situations.

3740 2018-06-19 16:27:54 i would recommend a micellar water (Yes To makes a good one!), this will get the dirt and grime off your face after a long day. i would also recommend an oil or moisturizer (Shea Moisture makes some great ones!)
3741 2018-06-19 16:27:29 I change the oil in my car in 20 minutes using ramps and hand tools.

3744 2018-06-19 16:27:07 I didn’t say Middle Easterns don’t like Inter.

But America is an untapped market with A LOT more potential. That’s where the BPL money is coming from, the deals with NBC and the number of owners they have that are American

What does ME offer besides oil money like PSG/Man City?

3765 2018-06-19 16:24:10 Saudi Arabia and Russia are pushing OPEC to raise oil output to meet growing demand. They've already lifted oil prices to US$ 75 per barrel from US$ 27 in 2016. Oil demand grows at the steepest pace in the 3rd quarter. In my view, this could lead to market overheating #lka
3766 2018-06-19 16:23:56 Like if ure cooking on higher temps ure better off using olive oil and the like, but if Im cooking  lower heat like omelette/or something that doesn't benefit from the flavour of olive oil I use butter

3769 2018-06-19 16:23:50 Totally get it! We have THC Oil capsules which I have calibrated for effect to match 5mg of synthetic THC (only better) mixing with Sicilian olive oil so that 1.5ml=1 dose. It took a lot of trial and error--not all of which was pleasant--keep us posted, will help in any way

3786 2018-06-19 16:21:55 3. for oily - never use moisturizers with oil in them, but oil based cleansers are A+ for some science reason. 
4. for dry - avoid harsh cleansers that "destroy oil!" and go for moisturizing instead.
5. for normal - you're lucky and I'm jealous lmao

3795 2018-06-19 16:21:02 Nonsense-the volatility of oil price and our larger dependence on that for Revenue in the unlikely event of Indy is a significant risk that many of us saw even pre-2014.

3806 2018-06-19 16:19:11 There's a vast difference between medical cannabis in, say, oil form and recreational cannabis in other forms. It's like banning hemp rope or clothing because it's made from the same plant.
3807 2018-06-19 16:19:04 The entire Western world’s economies collapsed in 1973 with the OPEC oil crisis.  We never really recovered!  All the G7 nations started borrowing from private banks and cutting corporate taxes.  And here we are today!

3880 2018-06-19 16:08:29 I’ve never taken it either and tbh never felt the need however seeing the seizures that little boy has and the belief his mother has that this oil alleviates his suffering then I reckon its medicinal benefits must be investigated properly and a rethink to separate it from the ban

3883 2018-06-19 16:08:22 In the not too distant future, the new oil may well be fresh water. For countries such as you mention, their priorities are well skewed. Governments are supposed to have one clear mandate, to protect citizens. Water shortage is going to be a problem soon.
3884 2018-06-19 16:08:19 Is it okey to put tissue oil first then make up. Does that protect ones skin. Im afraid of make up alone.

4029 2018-06-19 15:53:35 Not the Chinese because presumably they will buy more oil from Saudi Arabia, Russian and Iran plus west Africa. Not immediately clear who will take the US  production if China dials back.

4041 2018-06-19 15:52:17 Bernie proved many on the left prefer fast change and easy solution *snake oil* rather than face the realities of a slow moving very large democracy where progress is always going to be slow, imperfect and hard fought by its design.

4077 2018-06-19 15:48:40 The Marxists didn't have many shock troops, they came over from New York on a ship, with 3,500 highly trained electronic/transportation terrorists. They trained on Standard Oil New Jersey abandoned refinery. They immediately took the telegraph and train switch controls.
4078 2018-06-19 15:48:39 And what about the fact that the old people boom has only just finished being a vast working-and-paying-taxes boom. Not their fault that governments have 'lost' the grillions from that and from being an oil producing nation (we must be the world's only poor one).

4163 2018-06-19 15:40:44 Also might help to try and separate the profit side of it from the regulatory part of it (unlike most things MPs legislate for - eg: MPs who profit from property rental, medical cannabis farms, oil, weapons,hedge funds on Brexit).
4164 2018-06-19 15:40:38 Agree completely.  Oil & Gas only gives Manchin and WV state house a couple grand here and there for waivers that yield millions in earnings.  We're represented by corporate whores.

4175 2018-06-19 15:39:23 Fun fact #mtpol #mtnews: Halliburton made its money on oil but also on massive contracts during the Iraq War. The same war Cheney, a Zinke donor of largesse, put together and which Zinke overstates his record and accomplishment on. One big vicious circle ending in Whitefish.

4236 2018-06-19 15:32:39 chill a bit with the rhetoric. palm oil apparently makes up just over 50% of vegetable oil consumption from what I can see. and it's reductive to imply that reducing palm oil consumption will logically mean everyone will switch to soy, etc.

4286 2018-06-19 15:27:57 We (most of modern day Hindus) need to stop looking at dharmic activities and pursuits and day to day life activities and pursuits as being mutually infringing upon one another. They are not oil and water. They can be milk and honey if we will it that way.
4287 2018-06-19 15:27:38 A lot of attention will be given to ‘Faith Leaders’ as this crisis continues. We should appreciate all help but stop lauding them as moral superiors. They are all snake oil salespeople to a %.

4307 2018-06-19 15:26:05 This is timely too because I was just panicking a bit to Steve about how our current bottle of olive oil is half empty, and we don't have a backup. We usually always have a backup.
4308 2018-06-19 15:25:54 This guy was saying Trump was the shit because he’s helping the oil. BITCH I done almost smacked this dude w a plate.

4314 2018-06-19 15:25:25 I didn’t blow dry it today when I got out of the shower. All I did was slap some argon oil in it and comb it. I’m gonna start using this cream that is suppose to straighten it out. 

My beard just keeps curling up on itself regardless of length.
4315 2018-06-19 15:25:20 Not run by liberals, what of the oil companies, military sector. Same shit. They invest in the same shit. Who are they? Omfg are u that duped?
4316 2018-06-19 15:25:11 @VolkswagenSA in light of the increasing price of crude oil and the unstable Zar, when can we expect the launch of the Golf GTE in South Africa?. We are in dire need of high quality hybrid cars. Especially from Volkswagen.

4318 2018-06-19 15:25:07 Right? A YEAR?! What the hell? I go through so much olive oil. Sauteing, making dressing, making white pizza, roasting veggies, like...I can't fathom having a bottle last a year unless it was a really fucking big honking bottle.
4319 2018-06-19 15:25:01 How true----!!!!!
4320 2018-06-19 15:24:56 China buying oil from Iran would really piss off Trump and his all the world but Russia trade war

4323 2018-06-19 15:24:52 Sooooo good. In fact, today is my local farmer’s market, I think I’ll get some. I don’t even really need olive oil...
4324 2018-06-19 15:24:45 100%% ive already heard that seismic testing is affecting harvests and there have been oil spills. its already hurting our fishery - the industry that is 10000x more imp to creating a long-term sustainable economy for our province

4326 2018-06-19 15:24:27 I think you should stop using everything which involves a Muslim. I will support you. But you know what, you cant do that. Best of luck of you are using a bike or car cuz oil comes from muslim nations and yes they might have different work ethics. You be ashamed of yourself.
4327 2018-06-19 15:24:25 ありがとうございます。
4328 2018-06-19 15:24:24 If only these countries had oil......
4329 2018-06-19 15:24:21 Now look at Norway - state owned oil, trillion dollar trust fund for all society and democratic socialism done honestly and right
4330 2018-06-19 15:24:20 We buy oil, they buy spices and other food products. It's called trade. Btw, trading with non-Muslims is haram as per your terror book. But still it takes place all over the world. Get some knowledge but oh madarsas don't teach that.

4340 2018-06-19 15:23:18 You may have just identified where May will get her £20 Billion for the English NHS, after our oil paid for just about everything else!

The National Petroleum Corporation (NOC) issued a statement confirming that one of the oil tanks in Ras Lanov was seriously damaged and calling for the immediate withdrawal of the Ibrahim Jarran forces from the oil ports.

4342 2018-06-19 15:22:59 Its a double win for big oil. They get to destroy a pristine environment while screwing up the climate. We live in evil times.
4343 2018-06-19 15:22:54 Which Party is prone to sending young Americans in harm's ways to defend the interests of Netanyahu and U. S. oil firms in the Middle East? Which lawmakers leave American soldiers in the lurch when they returned home bodily and mentally broken? GOP POTUS and GOP lawmakers!
4344 2018-06-19 15:22:49 $GEVO yes it's parabolic but if you think about the market cap - about 25M$ that all this represents that's CHUMP CHANGE in the oil patch. It's a rounding error. This has plenty of room to continue.

4348 2018-06-19 15:22:34 Ask me if I put tanning oil on because I didn't think I could burn, and if I am now burned like a BIHHHHH.
4349 2018-06-19 15:22:27 @PardonMyTake comparing period blood to motor oil has me rollllling
4350 2018-06-19 15:22:25 It is. I love the Moroccan Argan Oil line, too.
4351 2018-06-19 15:22:15 ...and everyone, perhaps. But given that, I think "sell as much oil as possible and invest heavily into green tech" is a pretty good strategy if you're Norway. (Leaving all the oil & gas in the ground won't make a dent in CC.)
4352 2018-06-19 15:22:10 Its almost as if they inherited a worldwide downturn,  a global collapse of oil prices and a huge swamp of patronage, incompetence and failure to ever diversify Alberta's economy and were unwilling to make the weakest pay for a Conservative mess by slashing front line services..

4354 2018-06-19 15:21:55 Russia is selling bonds

Saudi Arabia ponders whether this is an opportunity
to cripple the Russian Oil industry.
4355 2018-06-19 15:21:54 I’m pretty sure I remember a Russian oil or oligarch angle to the collapse of Venezuela. Gangs don’t appear out of thin air.

4358 2018-06-19 15:20:59 I work in Oil and Gas, and I think this was the dumbest thing this government could have done.

All they had to do was provide support for it to get built, not literally buy into it.

4360 2018-06-19 15:20:52 The fact that you think the Germans could even realistically defeat the UK and the US without the Soviets shows how naive you are about logistics. The Germans were running low on oil by the time Operation Barbarossa began, that is why Hitler wanted to take the Caucasus.
4361 2018-06-19 15:20:49 You can use Tamanu Oil as your daily facial moisturizer accompanied by SPF, at all times.

Me: "I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you over the oil draining..."

Her: "They're weak and immature..."

Me: *Aristotle in one hand, a dumbbell in the other* 

Her: "Sorry, you're not my type."

Me: "What the..." 
4364 2018-06-19 15:20:24 Getting my oil changed, gotta work then run to the store to grab a couple things, pack and probably around 4am I’m making the drive to Pennsylvania for @TooManyGames and I’m so excited  first solo drive to another state in a few years too! Can’t wait to see everyone!

4366 2018-06-19 15:20:11 Should we do that with oil too?  I'ma bet you're ok with intervention there.
4367 2018-06-19 15:19:58 I feel like the biggest adjustment for a guy moving in w his gf, is the thin layer of coconut oil that now covers everything in the house

4371 2018-06-19 15:19:51 Hi, .@imake_SPARKSfly, your best bet is to use pure 100% tea tree oil and add in a couple drops to a shampoo/conditioner that's compatible with your 4C hair type, each time you wash your hair. Tea tree oil shampoos/conditioners tend to be targeted at oily hair.
4372 2018-06-19 15:19:34 It is easy to have a bad day - 2012 under 70k miles - AC went out, needs CV Joints, brake system is dangerous IMO even though you say its ok, oil consumption etc etc etc

4376 2018-06-19 15:19:14 Yeah! I just take it. It’s not too bad if you like coconut anyway. Just drink some water right after to get the oily taste out. But u can do it with any oil. Avocado oil, olive oil...I just prefer coconut.

4382 2018-06-19 15:18:38 Wouldn't responsibile and sustainable farming be the correct solution instead of an outright ban? Losing 70% of the world's oil production means we need to get it from somewhere else. How much land would be required to compensate? Especially if the yield is much lower?

4388 2018-06-19 15:18:15 Oil Change was legit depressing by the end. I think they wanted to document a triumphant rebuilt and it was three seasons of them just making the worst decisions on camera.

4433 2018-06-19 15:14:22 We do sort of have cowboys here, but they're mainly "rough necks", which are people who do oil field work and work on ranches or mainly outside in some way. These days, "cowboy" is more of an affectionate term. Love y'all!
4434 2018-06-19 15:14:16 getting my oil changed and overheard a conversation between two dudes:

WHY WOULDNT YOU? FRUITY BEERS ARE THE ONLY GOOD BEERS AND THAT’S AN OPINION I STAND BY.
4435 2018-06-19 15:14:15 I mean what are they really saying here? That they refuse to allow this plants oil to the terminally ill who would benefit greatly from it, because it would be unfair to the healthy few who like a ‘different part’ of the plant for recreational purposes? That’s Preposterous!

OIL！
4439 2018-06-19 15:13:39 Did the recycle him into olive oil?
4440 2018-06-19 15:13:35 I say charge them the same price for wheat that they charge us for oil, then watch those prices drop
4441 2018-06-19 15:13:27 Eh yeke? Betul ke tak cara pakai? Step cuci muka semua betul? Sbb aku kalau breakout mmg pakai tea tree oil je pastu flawless balik lah

4444 2018-06-19 15:13:19 Doesn't need legalising, there needs to be a prescription version for people who need the oil for their medical condition, why are they blowing this out of proportion.
4445 2018-06-19 15:13:17 Searching for the perfect beard oil. Probably the most difficult task I've tried in the last five years
4446 2018-06-19 15:13:15 lavender oil works for everything

4449 2018-06-19 15:13:09 I am a man in my fifties, worked the oil rigs and logging camps.
Spent time on the streets and a few stints inside.
I can’t listen to that tape anymore.
The voice, 6 yr. politely asking if she can phone her aunt.... just like a parent told her to if she is ever lost.
I’m in tears

4453 2018-06-19 15:12:50 @ashokhavarshini @Narayanan3 @ThanthiTV  as usual childish Ashoka is acting like paid media. Not allowing Narayanan to tell his point. Feeling like hitting Delete button of Ashoka named and make her out of show . This neeyallam oru anchor ah.. waiting to oil on fire
4454 2018-06-19 15:12:44 Right. Appeasement won't work. This is a war. On one side we have "renewables," coal and natural gas on the other side, bravely fighting alone, is nuclear. 
Oil for the most part is not even participating.

4458 2018-06-19 15:12:10 So much shit comes out of the PM's mouth, that I find it difficult to believe that she or her party have our interests at heart. 3 months to sort that wee boys medical cannabis oil proves how little the Tory scum care about the people and their problems.
4459 2018-06-19 15:12:07 pakai dah tea tree oil tu. memula elok, lama lama macam takda effect :(
4460 2018-06-19 15:12:03 ไม่หรอกค่ะ เราว่ามุกซังเขียนดีมากนะคะ อ่านแล้วก็ยิ้มตามตลอดหลายเรื่อง บางเรื่องก็กุมอกไปบ้างนะคะ ฟฟฟฟฟฟฟ/อยู่ในยูทูปเหรอคะ ไว้จะไปลองฟังดูค่ะ ฟฟฟ
4461 2018-06-19 15:11:47 Just had to convince a woman from Erie that I’m from Oil City because she was convinced that I had an accent 
4462 2018-06-19 15:11:33 It's a Radical day today as these fine pieces are available now! #KatanaDragon for heavy oil and the #BeyondRidiculousPearl for when you need length with a nice pop off friction. #Angular best describes these fine pieces. Get them at a Pro shop near you. #bowlerzkingdomproshop
4463 2018-06-19 15:11:30 Hahahahahahahahshahahahahah ya allah dugaan betul dua last tuuu. Acne kau beli je tea tree oil, letak dkt jerawat setiap hari. Takes time tapi worth it. Oily tu hmmm, kena pakai moisturiser kot lepas cuci muka? Balance kan balik hydration kat muka
4464 2018-06-19 15:11:30 I put way too much coconut oil in my hair, now it looks bad
4465 2018-06-19 15:11:11 And that's the thing aswell best believe we needed a new battery but the Mr got them to add oil and pump up the air in the tyres aswell  for FREE! If I came alone it would have been an expensive problem kmt
4466 2018-06-19 15:11:09 Aye, people keep reminding him of the oil fund.
4467 2018-06-19 15:11:08 On pain? 
When i shave it looks and feels like a wax cause i use coconut oil but it doesn't last long 
4468 2018-06-19 15:11:06 Higher Chinese tariffs+strong $=risk of China devaluation. Suggests low US consumer impact and really painful for Chinese companies owing $debt. Oh and oil becomes even more expensive for them.
4469 2018-06-19 15:11:02 I actually smoke it but I'm picky about the types I smoke. I'd take it in oil form but because it's illegal it's impossible to source an oil that has the right effects without also being so strong one drop floors you and makes it impossible to move for hours
4470 2018-06-19 15:10:57 It’s oil paint.
4471 2018-06-19 15:10:44 Whats the delay, in allowing medical cannabis oil to be used under supervision......the PM can go to war on the drop of a hat and with the flimsiest excuse?
4472 2018-06-19 15:10:39 Everytime I came back home, we have this routine where adam and mia would give me "hair massage" by combing my hair with oil and completely ruins it after for me to take over 
4473 2018-06-19 15:10:22 Slider, since they are a high galleries, skylights, cellars, A rift in a reefer?” “Who is no oil pool.
4474 2018-06-19 15:10:16 Waiting for these mechanics to come in and tell me we need a new air filter, 4 new tires and a new motor when I just came in for a oil change & ain't nothing wrong.  
4475 2018-06-19 15:10:15 Karena didunia ini gada yang sempurna, jadi aku kasih 8.5 deh. coverage dan oil controlnya cukup bagus buat bedak dengan harga murah 
4476 2018-06-19 15:10:12 Hope palm oil plantation will never start there. Don't want another few species to go extinct
4477 2018-06-19 15:10:08 え、君顎あるの？顎ってやっぱりどこかで買うの？僕顎持ってないんだけど。
4478 2018-06-19 15:10:07 Haah. Tapi org recommend awak beli Garden of Eden Rosa T . Memang untuk acne. Plus dia pakai tea tree oil tapi tak rasa pedih pun. Dulu org pakai masa form 3 time tu penuh jerawat kat muka. Doctor yg recommend. Pastu dia hilang da. Pastu terus stop pakai da heheh
4479 2018-06-19 15:10:00 Don't forget the pillaging--  One of the things he put in his presentation to try and get back in with our military was "take the minerals, oil and gems"  from all these countries he wants to go in.
4480 2018-06-19 15:09:54 I’ve been waiting to get a oil change since 8:55am. I’m annoyed
4481 2018-06-19 15:09:51 Lol no be lie i swear
Better Oil dey your head boss
4482 2018-06-19 15:09:50 oh, hey I gave my dog CBD oil and I think it really  helped her. (Got it at a non-marijuana herb store in Maryland.) She couldn't handle pain killers, but CBD on her food seemed to help a lot without knocking her out. And no fighting to get her to take a pill.
4483 2018-06-19 15:09:47 Anywhere else other than Disney if the food was cooked in meat and fish oil it would not be labelled as vegan!
4484 2018-06-19 15:09:42 アディショナルタイム中にちゅーるもらってましたーーーーーーｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗ
4485 2018-06-19 15:09:33 Can someone be long USD & Oil at the same time?

Mid term. Next 6 months.
4486 2018-06-19 15:09:13 I would play with oil paints!
4487 2018-06-19 15:08:58 Must confess - I find @ClarkeMicah interesting as a writer but I disagree with him on how he sees cannabis. I am not a cannabis user myself but I have autism and if it helps a child with autism not to have seizures to take cannabis oil - it should be legal.
4488 2018-06-19 15:08:57 Rubbish. "Members of the Scottish Parliament have backed an indefinite moratorium on fracking and unconventional oil and gas"
4489 2018-06-19 15:08:52 you just submitted a promissory note to yourself that will be paid with an oil tanker sized future regret
4490 2018-06-19 15:08:49 Lime essential oil scented soaps..... smells so good!
4491 2018-06-19 15:08:48 Oil fund..this is what you will ALWAYS be remembered for.
4492 2018-06-19 15:08:45 Yes you can. You’re still gonna eat vegan/vegetarian because you’re still not gonna eat meat even if it’s cooked in the same oil. I can understand how it can disgust certain people, but it’s no less vegan/vegetarian. The oil doesn’t “become” meat.
4493 2018-06-19 15:08:39 US energy to be targetted by Beijing for retaliatory action
 
US oil, gas and coal face 25% levy in threatened second wave of duties
4494 2018-06-19 15:08:18 I think the man who did my oil change wanted to kill me cause he loosened some shit by my tire
4495 2018-06-19 15:07:49 found a local brand that has a yummy shop version - a bit like your homemade but already in a jar, no palm oil! and no requirement to buy a food processor:) gonna trial it on my kids @TigerBrands

4497 2018-06-19 15:07:35 Religion shouldn't be bought into everything and by no means should it divide us. You can't mix tea with oil!
4498 2018-06-19 15:07:31 KUWAIT OIL MINISTER SAYS #OPEC AND NON-OPEC PRODUCERS NOT DISCUSSING OIL PRICE LEVELS, BUT RATHER PRODUCTION LEVELS, REALIZING MARKET STABILITY AND PREVENTING PRICE FLUCTUATIONS: KUNA. #OOTT
4499 2018-06-19 15:07:22 Why doesn’t the oil companies list the price per LT on their sign before tax?   Whenever you see a product advertised or promoted in a store it never includes tax. Why should fuel be any different?

4501 2018-06-19 15:07:12 i had to swallow my pride while trying to put oil in my car at the gas station because i couldn’t get the cap off and my hood doesn’t stay up on its own (like it should) and the guy i asked to help me said “honey you can ask me for help any time because you’re sexier than hell”

4504 2018-06-19 15:06:55 How to make a grilled cheese not boring, rub the outside of the sweet potatoe bread with sweet paprika spice,put grated mozzarella and ghouda on the bread,mix red onions,jalapenos,cherry tomatoes,Jabanero tobasco,and smoked chipotle chili powder in,slow cook it in pure olive oil.
4505 2018-06-19 15:06:46 I wanna go outside and tan in my short shorts and tube top but Idk if my brothers are fixing their trucks and stuff and having their friends with them  that’s a waste get oil everywhere and just to come back in

4508 2018-06-19 15:06:36 Smoke oil instead of bud. Indica strains.
4509 2018-06-19 15:06:36 @Sask_NDP when you appoint a Transcanada lobbyist as chief of staff i think this is a red flag that you've been taken over by big oil. You need a new leader!
4510 2018-06-19 15:06:29 ครั้งหน้าเราจะไม่พลาด555
4511 2018-06-19 15:06:12 I took my car to get the smog test done and the man said to me “so tell your parents it looks like you are leaking oil” sorry dude I’ll tell my parents but I’m sure they won’t give two fucks lol
4512 2018-06-19 15:06:09 Fundamentally, it's an opposition to oil and gas consumption, and also to spending infrastracture funds on roads that serve oil and gas consuming vehicles.
4513 2018-06-19 15:06:07 それが妥当かと...
4514 2018-06-19 15:06:02 You HAD pants that matched. Did that oil stain ever come out?
4515 2018-06-19 15:05:59 one thing that is commonly used in Oz is eucalyptus oil for landing and take-off to reduce ear pain... I think some parents could benefit from using herbal stuff like this to make the journey a bit more comfortable for little kids
4516 2018-06-19 15:05:55 Kuwait oil min says OPEC and other producers will at upcoming meeting take appropriate decision to maintain oil mkt stability
4517 2018-06-19 15:05:53 For others it was getting high on smell of cordite and gun oil......
4518 2018-06-19 15:05:41 The #Coalition successfully eliminated yet another Daesh leader, Abu Khattab Al-Iraqi, who oversaw fundraising for the terrorist organization through oil & gas sales. This further dismantles Daesh long-term access to reliable funding. #CoalitionProgress #DefeatDaesh @CJTFOIR
4519 2018-06-19 15:05:34 I get petroleum/oil, take away and investments - for a skint eco vegan... I let them - waste the budget on me
4520 2018-06-19 15:05:32 Mine always had margin calls. Bought oil falling knife from 40 to under 10. Wayyyyy back
4521 2018-06-19 15:05:32 Wish it were astounding that an article in NYT on oil, oil-burning vehicle interests working to kill mass transit doesn't even mention the 1938-50 Streetcar Conspiracy. It's as if cars & highways came down from Mount Sinai w/Moses, same time the 5th Fleet went to the Persian Gulf

4526 2018-06-19 15:03:43 You see Susang, Sanda is virtuous and you aren’t. That means she doesn’t have to answer logical questions. As long as she signals to others that she cares, no answer is needed.
4527 2018-06-19 15:03:32 I bought an oil diffuser but I've read that the scent may be harmful to my cat. Any pet owners have experience w/ this product?
4528 2018-06-19 15:03:31 mom last night talking about when to leave the house to get my oil changed: “let’s leave the house at 11, 12 is too late” 
mom now, at 11: still in bed, asleep
4529 2018-06-19 15:03:31 Take that oil!
4530 2018-06-19 15:03:30 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
4531 2018-06-19 15:03:25 Literally: to sell oil
4532 2018-06-19 15:03:25 While that may be true in your case, many of our foods are high in salt, starch, oil, etc... so imagine eating that your whole life. But then again that’s what makes it so good, so idk if I can sacrifice that.
4533 2018-06-19 15:03:25 @ryanmeili when you appoint a former Transcanada oil lobbyist to work with you it definitely diminishes any credibility you have and your party. Not leadership! Id expect this from liberals.

4536 2018-06-19 15:03:12 been guzzling fish oil capsules every day this week and im not even smarter??? confused.... big pharma is a scam u heard it here on my twitter first
4537 2018-06-19 15:03:09 at least they understand what fracking is and have a position on it...... are you any closer to working out how we could start an oil fund?

genuine question chuckles?
4538 2018-06-19 15:02:50 Mums just covered all the machines in the gym in oil because she insisted the oil made her legs look “like good gym lady legs”
4539 2018-06-19 15:02:34 Kung talagang kailangan mo na at wala ka nang ibang option (lalo na’t di mo dala yung tea tree oil mo) baka merong spot treatment sa Watsons? Not a good person for acne recs but quite familiar with skincare
4540 2018-06-19 15:02:34 I’m only ok with it roasted with a lil olive oil and garlic salt
4541 2018-06-19 15:02:30 .Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
4542 2018-06-19 15:02:29 Remember MCN in Dallas? Did you go to the Perot museum of science? They had half a floor dedicated to how irrefutably awesome fracking is.

It's hard to maintain editorial independence when your nation's museums are almost-universally funded by oil barons.
4543 2018-06-19 15:02:18 Yep.. Ginamit ko na yung contact lens maeexpire na ngaun e.. Noon kasi kinatatamaran kong ilagay.. Tpos ng try lang ako ng false eye lashes.. Di effective castol oil e.. Parang naglalagas..hmm

4550 2018-06-19 15:01:37 Did you know the poor have to do this a lot. They choose between heating oil and food., bills and food. Mogg has never had to do that in his life. Who is he to give advice?
4551 2018-06-19 15:01:33 Building a wall, throwing people in cages and throwing millions of dollars at this problem is like filling the oil tank when you have a leak. It's not getting to the root cause of the problem. End the incentive(the welfare state) that causes them to want to come here illegally.

Stronger USD, weaker EM FX, lower oil = Weaker US ISM coming soon.

リカお誕生日おめでとう
出会ってからもう9年目？
月日流れるの早すぎて泣きそうT^T
それだけあって今お互い全く違う生活だね。江木の明日の実習ぶっ飛ばしたいし、リカの職場もアホほど増員して謎の休暇命令出ろって感じ☆
色々と難しいけど、リカの21歳だけは幸せでありますように
4575 2018-06-19 14:59:56 Not surprised Oil & Gas are behind @Tesla sabotage. 20+ years ago they, plus carmakers poured THOUSANDS against #Seattle vote for light rail. You all can thank them for our traffic woes today.

4577 2018-06-19 14:59:37 You’re just in NYC. So it’s a group mentality.... you need to research what and why these young children are be taken in and how they are being taken care of . Don’t just believe the crap, look it up that’s all
4578 2018-06-19 14:59:30 The Impressionists tried to capture objectivity as a function of local light, a task beyond the capacity of oil paint. This became an obsession for Monet. Obviously, the Impressionist's opaque vision is far removed from the way things look.
4579 2018-06-19 14:59:15 The thing that changed my skin life was when I started using gel moisturizer and dropped anything oil based. I have pretty all around oily skin though

4582 2018-06-19 14:59:05 Oil prices will go down (due to Saudi & Russia increases) thereby hurting Venezuela and Iran (both can’t increase production that much).
4583 2018-06-19 14:59:01 We are breaking records for U.S. oil exports! The trend has been up significantly over the past year, rising from the 1.5 million barrels per day level, to continually hitting 2 million barrels per day. This is large in part to the surge in U.S. shale production. #OilExports

4587 2018-06-19 14:58:20 I have a friend, age 57, who has had anxiety issues all her life, and she swears by it. Says it calms things down without knocking you out. I think hers is some sort of oil? Not smoked, anyway.
4588 2018-06-19 14:58:13 Can I get that at Watson's? Or South Star? I usually use tea tree oil but I'm not at home.

4591 2018-06-19 14:58:01 I find it very confusing, there is cannabis oil in Holland & Barratt, but I wonder how effective that is.
4592 2018-06-19 14:57:44 The recent cases have had experts from all over the world. With the exception of CG who offered that family snake oil. There has to be a final outcome. But then people would call it a death panel. I dont think you can win no matter what you do.
4593 2018-06-19 14:57:42 Firstly, Higher GDP isn't a determiner of lower religiosity in Muslim countries. Secondly name a successful muslim country thats wealth ism't oil based.

4601 2018-06-19 14:57:06 Dunno. It's only one compound in cannabis (THC) that causes a user to get stoned (which btw is way less enjoyable than a morphine high). I already use CBD oil tbh (cannabis oil minus the THC).

4607 2018-06-19 14:56:25 It's really about oil, IMO, just as it was in the 50's & 60's when the same thing happened to electric streetcar systems at the whim of GM and the oil industry. When will they start in on efficient freight rail in the name of the trucking industry?
4608 2018-06-19 14:56:21 Need to oil my joints again. I swear, sometimes I feel like the tin man from the wizard of oz =A=
4609 2018-06-19 14:56:20 OPEC and these oil Co. Are FOS. Why does it matter. They raise prices 10cents a clip compared to lowering it 3cents every 6 months.  They have every excuse to raise the price. FOS!
4610 2018-06-19 14:56:09 Don’t be too hard on yourself. I hope tomorrow is better for you. Have you tried lavender essential oil? I rub it on my temples and neck when I’m having a rough time.
4611 2018-06-19 14:56:01 Exactly, people complaining about high gas prices don't understand that it's a temporary necessity to drive DOMESTIC oil production, increasing oil independency, and ultimately reducing costs everywhere.
4612 2018-06-19 14:55:56 Ottawa may as well trade Duchene to Oil for Lucic One for one haha the Sens wanna live in 31st !
4613 2018-06-19 14:55:36 Just checked my oil. Ain’t shit in there. Lord I don’t feel like this shit today.
4614 2018-06-19 14:55:23 I object to: the immorality of separating families, tax cuts for the rich, no health care for middle class & poor, a planned strategy to bankrupt SS & Medicare due to tax cuts, coal & oil vs sustainable energy, attack on environment & pubic lands, white supremacy, a lying Prez
4615 2018-06-19 14:55:13 Not old Butter Cookie tin! Yea all dry oil mists aren't for everybody. Even when you use it on damp skin.

4619 2018-06-19 14:54:44 I used to have oily hair a lot. I had to shower every other day. But I learned to use hair masks trrstment before I shampoo. Then I don’t condition afterwards as I sometimes put argan oil in it.
4620 2018-06-19 14:54:28 Definitely oil painting
4621 2018-06-19 14:54:24 Who told you this since we all know you don't read. You don't want America to be smart because any one with a modicum of intelligence wouldn't take your word over an actual snake oil salesman.
4622 2018-06-19 14:54:11 Isn't CBD oil legal?
4623 2018-06-19 14:54:00 Here's an awesome recipe for a homemade vegan body butter

1 cup of raw virgin coconut oil 
1 cup of raw cacao butter 
3-4 drops any essential oil 

Mix all these ingredient on high heat in a pot until it all incorporates into a liquid. Then let it cool and freeze it for an hour

4627 2018-06-19 14:53:37 USA social services infrastructure is drowning. Why aren’t we pursuing partnering en force with Mexico to rebuild based on strongest industries (other than cartels and oil & gas) and new industries that cover a more global need: food, medicine, hospitality, alternative energy?
4628 2018-06-19 14:53:35 Norway produces more than 10 times the amount of oil that UK does. No comparison revenue wise.
4629 2018-06-19 14:53:30 A measure of #oil volatility rose to the highest since February amid drop in prices and questions lingering around whether #OPEC will agree to ease output cuts at this week’s meeting #WTI #crude #OOTT #oilmarket #oiltrading
4630 2018-06-19 14:53:24 They used to have perfumes but they replaced them with dry oil mists which didn’t last at all. They brought back the one perfume that smells like an old butter cookie tin. I was heated. Vera Wang huh?

4634 2018-06-19 14:53:09 That is why I would like to try it.  I don't smoke or do drugs. But a few friends do the cannabis oil. And it has improved there life's. Tired of popping tablets.

4650 2018-06-19 14:51:05 Syafe. Beli cleansing oil or even olive oil. Melt down the makeup/mascara first baru wipe. Kalau tak mmg bulu mata akan jatuh, if not jadi brittle. Z
4651 2018-06-19 14:50:47 It's super easy too.  Don't buy a vacuum sealer either. A Ziploc will do.

For the steak, season with kosher salt/pepper, put in oil/thyme with it, and close the bag and suck the air out.

When done, sear on both sides for a couple minutes and then let it rest.

4661 2018-06-19 14:49:36 Oil painting 
4662 2018-06-19 14:49:36 I smoke it but I'm picky about the types I smoke because I do it to ease up a movement disorder and to make myself hungry after seizures (food revolts me usually). I'd take an oil but because it's illegal, sourcing the right one that isn't super strong is impossible.
4663 2018-06-19 14:49:35 I think your being too literal with the idea of it being legalised as is (bud and leaves) when it would be for medical reasons only. CBD oil is not generally smoked but drops placed on inside of mouth. Equally we are already the biggest growers & distributors of cannabis.

4685 2018-06-19 14:47:53 Hi Andrew, you may be interested in following discussions from the European Roundtable conf 25-26 June where experts will come together to discuss how the action that is taken in Europe can influence the #sustainable #palm oil market. Submit questions using #EURT2018
4686 2018-06-19 14:47:52 No it is not hypocrisy, you tw*t. No-one pours alcohol down another's throat. Laws exist to prevent passive smoking of tobacco. MD Prescribing oil to patient with clinical need isn't the same as free-for-all recreational toking by potheads, anytime, anywhere, any qty.
4687 2018-06-19 14:47:49 Kashmir was born a demented child, thanks to the collusion of Nehru with Mountbatten.His weakness was known. And after independence he and his dynasty gave teeth to terrorism in the name of terrorism.Pak agents like @ArvindKejriwal poured oil on the fire

4707 2018-06-19 14:45:59 Two things you should know:

1) Modi Govt UDAY scheme has helped debt laden discoms reduce annual losses by 70% to around Rs 17,350 crore in last 2 years.

2) Modi Govt. had inherited Rs 1.30 lakh crore unpaid bills of the oil companies during 2009-14. It paid back with interest.

4763 2018-06-19 14:39:41 It does, although by the time oil runs low clean(er) coal is likely. Also it is close to or under the main industrial economies so no more reliance on counties unstable regions. (I used to be a faceworker at Rossington Main Colliery).

4765 2018-06-19 14:39:27 Or we could realize that deficit spending isn't the end of the world, private property isn't sacrosanct, high taxation on the very wealthy and gov't reinvestment of that money is good for the economy. And then massively invest in renewable energy, leaving more oil in the ground.

4775 2018-06-19 14:37:24 The pharmaceutical and health care industries have very powerful lobbies. They donate millions to Republican election campaigns. If politicians passed price controls, goodbye money, and hello better-funded opponent. 
Same with oil and gas & private networks of the ultra-wealthy.
4776 2018-06-19 14:37:24 So essentially Alberta has transferred $200+ Billion to a province that despises its Oil and Gas industry, and which would rather buy Saudi Oil than allow a pipeline through its province.  #Canadaisbroken

4783 2018-06-19 14:36:39 The current public debate about cannabis is utterly absurd, because cannabis oil for medical purposes is being conflated with recreational use. Cannabis oil doesn't contain any psychoactive substances, so 'the war on cannabis' is a ridiculous idea.

4826 2018-06-19 14:32:34 Unconventional production has a completely different business model--that has yet to demonstrate positive cash flow w/o accounting sleight-of-hand.

4877 2018-06-19 14:26:36 You're making the same mistake as many others. The medical product is Cannabis oil and you'd have to drink a hell of a lot of it to get the same amount of cannabinoids as a cannabis smoker. They are 2 different things.

4880 2018-06-19 14:26:03 Seems with rising oil price + strengthening dollar it could put a real hurt on China. Do you think China will have success with new exchange for oil futures priced in RMB?
4881 2018-06-19 14:26:00 I  agree with you and am an advocate for this, however we are dealing with an #LNP government and if they are elected again we are stuck with them, they will only back oil/coal/gas!

4884 2018-06-19 14:25:26 Perhaps this is so for you Marion, but all people are different. Many who benefit because of the rebuilding of their bodies resistance to aggressive cancers for instance argue that chemo was killing them? Of course the oil won’t be perfect for everyone!

4887 2018-06-19 14:25:09 Iran and Venezuela looking like little tiny dogs barking in attempts to push oil higher. Crude range should be $55-$70. Russians and Saudis understand.
4888 2018-06-19 14:25:09 Obama wanted the US to have $9/gallon pump prices which would have been about $200/barrel crude oil. Ironic that so many are so quick to criticize @realDonaldTrump actions that result in success while fellating #Obama for policies that result in bad economic outcomes.

1) Modi Govt UDAY scheme has helped debt laden discoms reduce annual losses by 70% to around Rs 17,350 crore in last 2 years.

2) Modi Govt. had inherited Rs 1.30 lakh crore unpaid bills of the oil companies during 2009-14. It paid back with interest.

4908 2018-06-19 14:22:49 I must just say that a medically controlled ketogenic diet for most of the illnesses that are helped with cannabis oil, should be tried, especially for many forms of epilepsy.  It has been used for many, many years and worth looking into

4966 2018-06-19 14:17:52 It only takes $33,000/month to be in the top 1% of earners in the US.  That's not a lot of money.  Having worked in the oil and gas industry, most people starting stunting when they get to $12,000/month.  Losers.

The inspection was due in April.
4973 2018-06-19 14:17:01 Legalise the oil for medical reasons for those who it has proved yo be successful. Cruel to deny it for these people.
4974 2018-06-19 14:16:52 Today I blended it with 1/2 T MCT oil, 1 T heavy cream and 2 T grass fed butter.  Mixed it with a milk frother.  Really tasty.

4989 2018-06-19 14:15:10 There are a wide range of forecasts on oil demand. No consensus position. Some forecast oil demand peaking by 2030 or before.

4994 2018-06-19 14:15:04 NY State needs gas and oil for its residents and businesses. What you are doing is putting the burden of producing oil and gas that we use on some other state or country. That is short sighted. Better to allow drilling and have regular inspections to ensure  it is safe.

5064 2018-06-19 14:08:02 Sirji, please get the religious boys see reason as well. Oil mainly comes from Muslim countries but do they eat & drink oil? Do not justify abuse of a women with silly reasons. Go to police if offended.

5082 2018-06-19 14:05:18 The US has huge oil reserve fields but 8 years under the O-Admin, BO closed many of its oil rigs making way for OPEC to play with the market’s oil price.

5268 2018-06-19 13:47:44 Let's review the advantages for the US.  1) It's going to make oil prices higher.  2) It's mainly going to support Canadian jobs, and 3) It's going to cause some pretty difficult to clean up spills, especially since the asphalt part of the mix sinks rather than floats in water.

5335 2018-06-19 13:41:49 for eg: yield of palm oil is higher, but it only grows in certain regions (unlike sunflower, etc), which are particularly vulnerable - hence the problem with deforestation and destruction of jungles.

5340 2018-06-19 13:41:28 Jojoba oil is awesome to use on the face because it most closely mirrors human sebum. It’s actually a liquid wax ester from a plant that grows in the southwest deserts.

5342 2018-06-19 13:41:13 The main reason that work with this sludge is only recent is that only recently have we used up so much of the accessible oil reserves that the price has risen high enough to justify cost.

"Scotland props up UK"
"Scotland more than pays its way"
"We'll have an oil fund growing £1bn/yr"
"We'll have Norway spending on low Irish taxes"

All lies. SNP doesn't care about economic/social cost, just power.

5423 2018-06-19 13:32:48 1c) Did I mention you actually have to heat this kind of oil to get it to move anywhere, and you have to dilute it with other oil for the same reason?  And waste a shit-ton of clean burning natural gas to get that sludge moving?
5424 2018-06-19 13:32:31 When washing your face, use warm water ? if the water is too hot, you risk washing away too much oil and drying out your skin.

5507 2018-06-19 13:22:39 I thought the reason this was in the news was because the Government had relaxed the law and had allowed the use of Cannabis Oil. As with any high level dispensation this was under strict regulations. So how is this going to be regulated? or is the plan to deregulate all Cannabis

5536 2018-06-19 13:17:18 Bili u potatoes. Sagot ko na ang oil at crispy fry 
5537 2018-06-19 13:17:16 Yeah bro.. that’s what I heard..and the reviews are mad, just type Jamaican black castor oil in your search
5538 2018-06-19 13:16:57 WTI OIL-We mapped out a range in our 6/12 letter: $63.00 to $67.60.On 6/14 WTI (N) topped out @ $67.16 (our sell zone) & then traded down to $63.59 yesterday (our buy zone). Crude then rallied as high as $65.98 allowing us to take some profit @ $65.00/50 on the upside #NYMEX #OIL

5541 2018-06-19 13:16:25 My beard and mustache oil smells like angostura bitters.
5542 2018-06-19 13:16:18 Just being bored waiting around on an oil change, nbd
5543 2018-06-19 13:16:09 No wonder UPA was able to keep oil prices down.
5544 2018-06-19 13:16:01 On August 28, 2012, the Obama administration announced new fuel efficiency standards. He required cars and light trucks obtain 54.5 MPG by 2025. That would reduce oil consumption by 12B barrels, saving drivers $1.7 trillion. It would also reduce the damage of climate change
5545 2018-06-19 13:15:57 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
5546 2018-06-19 13:15:48 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
5547 2018-06-19 13:15:45 No way! This oil just stink so wiuck.
5548 2018-06-19 13:15:39 Hahaha really! Put it in a bowl and add 3 spoons of water and 3 spoons of oil (not engine oil )
5549 2018-06-19 13:15:27 @JustinTrudeau why not threaten to suspend American patents on Canadian soil and when will we stop sending oil to US @ discounted price
5550 2018-06-19 13:15:13 No hay un litro de gas oil..Que pobreza

5554 2018-06-19 13:14:57 We already know that medical cannabis is hugely beneficial from a huge body of evidence coming from countries that have already gone ahead with it. 

You can make CBD oil at home, there are YouTube how to videos.
5555 2018-06-19 13:14:54 To bad she does not know the context of the passage, or she does know it ignores it, either way she is shameless in selling her snake oil. #Hillary #misquote #shameless

5557 2018-06-19 13:14:45 Maybe our big armies could go help the people running for their lives in their own countries, I know they don't have oil but they need help, they would rather not travel weeks with no money , food or shelter to this shithole country anyway..
5558 2018-06-19 13:14:45 It is - although I don't use tahini, too lazy on that front. I use sesame seed oil. Does practically the same job, cheap and doesn't go off.
5559 2018-06-19 13:14:44 Hmm No, but I think I have lavender oil... I’ll make some lotion with it!
5560 2018-06-19 13:14:41 and yet ... THIS administration is ENFORCING the policy it did not create.  
 *** Do you have the "snake oil" kiosk set up yet in the WH lobby?
5561 2018-06-19 13:14:40 China is the problem and I guess we must wait for the Trump Admin to find that out. NoKo in China to get sanctions lifted I imagine. It's reported many sanctions already have been lifted by China like oil. We have S.China Sea looming, tariffs and Trumps blindside.
5562 2018-06-19 13:14:30 The cheap argan oil strips hair dye, so this could be really helpful
5563 2018-06-19 13:14:28  Really? Even the alcohol free witch hazel? Using it right after I wash my face usually locks in the moisture then I add the vitamin e oil. I’ve been doing that for about a month now & my skin is so soft.

5577 2018-06-19 13:12:40 only successful arab countries are gulf countries who got lucky with oil, before that they too were epic failures.
5578 2018-06-19 13:12:39 Are you running low on snake oil?
5579 2018-06-19 13:12:26 Amazing how these small things become inseparable parts of life. In fact, these small things act as hooks that keep certain memories alive. This oil had a distinct aroma. Lazy afternoons were in the company of grandma, her stories, and Jabakusum Taila.

5607 2018-06-19 13:08:20 The Romans used to clean themselves with olive oil since they did not have any soap. They would pour the oil on their bodies, and then use a strigil, which is type of blade, to scrape off any dirt along with the oil
5608 2018-06-19 13:08:09 @WendySiegelman Keep telling the truth which is Matthew 25. Which is to run the OPEC nations out of oil.

5611 2018-06-19 13:07:22 And if she'd just said the CBD oil was his food supplement then she could have brought it into the UK or even bought it in the UK. But she said it was "medicine", may also have a higher THC level than permitted but it's the CBD that relieves his symptoms
5612 2018-06-19 13:06:51 All a bit of a minefield really isn’t it. I’m just curious as to how others might perceive it really. One day mr men, next day biffing out an oil painting.
5613 2018-06-19 13:06:51 @sajidjavid Canibis Oil is a God send. And considering my many pain related health problems. I too have asked my doctor, if trials had yet begun only last week. But much to my disappointment they had not!

5622 2018-06-19 13:05:29 We have the black card. Gas, oil changes and food. That thing pays for itself and often wet get additionnal money back. Oil changes there. Sooooooo much cheaper

5624 2018-06-19 13:05:22 is it 'I've carefully considered this issue, cannabis oil is oil made from cannabis & I don't need it so no one else can have it, no matter how much they'd benefit'

5642 2018-06-19 13:02:15 For extra fun: often the warning lights are flat-out lies! The arcane glyph it was showing me was the oil-level warning. Frantically pulled over on the highway and checked the oil, and it was perfectly fine and hasn’t misbehaved since.

5669 2018-06-19 12:58:15 @VinnieTortorich Really stupid question but I’m sitting here drinking my coffee with coconut oil in it because I hear you talk about coconut oil in things. Why am I putting it in coffee? Is it just to get the fat content?

5672 2018-06-19 12:58:05 Beijing’s retaliatory measures against US tariffs can include penalties on oil coming to China from America. A cut in Chinese purchases of US oil may benefit Iran’s sales.

5700 2018-06-19 12:54:23 Honestly castor oil and coconut oil worked the best for me out of all the expensive ass@peoducts I tried as a blonde :o
5701 2018-06-19 12:54:12 If I recall correctly, the Iran #oil sanctions game hasn't yet really begun. That's in November. Let's all wait til the game starts before we judge the outcome.
5702 2018-06-19 12:54:04 No I’m saying the oil and gas industries are far more complex than “Rep Tenney took 50k from them so oil prices are higher now”
5703 2018-06-19 12:54:01 Remember the North Sea Oil money?  In Norway they saved that for future generations.  The UK threw theirs away in tax breaks to rich people.  Who was in government then? oh yes, the Tories. I don't see it being spent on education and infrastructure a waste, more of an investment.

Never hear them mentioned on any media. Should we cut back on our oil imports? Prez should be able to leverage this?
5711 2018-06-19 12:53:15 And how does China expect to pay for that oil without SWIFT or a waiver? You think Iran is going to accept Renminbi or barter for ALL that oil? Is China going to open a branch of a bank in India that does no business with any US entity? Maybe. But it’s complicated

5717 2018-06-19 12:52:29 Could conceivably go to Xanadu tonight but I get home from work at 5:30 and I need to get my oil changed. We’ll see

5741 2018-06-19 12:49:18 Let me tell you about housing, as I travel Texas. West Texas. Permian Basin. A motel room costs between $400-$650 per night. Why? Increase in oil and gas production and the oil workers are living there. Oil companies pay their rent, so the motels raise their rates. Illegal!
5742 2018-06-19 12:49:16 Oil date to be corrected. Also I would argue that Saudi Arabia has existed in one form or another for longer than officially recognized by Western institutions.

5747 2018-06-19 12:48:53 I’m sure they’re all laughing at the US falling over itself to produce so much light oil that the market can’t buy & that we can’t even get to the market because our pipeline situation is so under developed

5750 2018-06-19 12:48:44 I know that, it clearly said that in the video but it would be the start of it! It would be gradually easier to get, less things would qualify to get the treatment, you may not be able to get high off the oil but things can be changed, could be used as an additive etc

5763 2018-06-19 12:47:27 Might be worth pointing out that medical cannabis oil is about as fun to take as paracetamol, it's specifically THC-free and doesn't get you high.
5764 2018-06-19 12:47:12 Someone should probably inform Jeremy Vine that, like olive oil is not "liquid olive", cannabis oil is not "liquid cannabis".

5773 2018-06-19 12:46:03 Exactly. There’s nothing wrong with an increase from Saudis perspective because if they have customers for their oil at the price they want then why not sell more? Look at what Saudi set its last basket prices at? Russia & Saudi have heavy crude to sell to China &

5786 2018-06-19 12:45:09 It’s not legal here - CBD oil is which is what H&B sell, what Charlotte has been prescribed for Billy is different. It contains THC which is illegal in this country. It’s a very different product!
5787 2018-06-19 12:45:09 China has emerged as the biggest Asian market for U.S. crude, but Beijing's tariffs could halt the purchases by making American oil too expensive
5788 2018-06-19 12:44:49 It helps those with Parkinson’s, cancer, epilepsy, pain. Thc (canabis oil) and cbd (hemp oil) are different and have different uses.
5789 2018-06-19 12:44:49 so, Heroin is illegal, but Morphine is legal - (and remember Heroin was named by a Bayer research scientist) so maybe someone needs to come up with a new name for cannabis oil (can't see tories legalising Heroin for medical use either - except it is!)

5807 2018-06-19 12:42:17 @WilliamJHague i use CBD oil for severe pain in my shoulder although it helps access to a stronger THC version would change my life incredibly.
it's about time we changed the law, 
permits should be given so people can grow their own for consumption within their homes only.

I say legalise Cannabis Oil&Cannabis for medicinal use only&there is plenty of hard evidence that it works
 Use of cannabis for recreational use is a seperate debate&it doesn't help the medical one

5822 2018-06-19 12:40:45 Idiots! Nobody is asking them to ‘legalise cannabis’ per say for casual use, that is an entirely different argument that many have little interest in! We’re taking about authorising ‘medicinal oil’ (THC) to benefit life threatening disability sufferers! Differentiate please!

5838 2018-06-19 12:39:05 With Venezuelan oil production heading below 1m bpd, and Russia pushing to increase since forever, the market can handle it so if there are buyers for Saudi heavy crude why WOULDN’T they want to increase, esp if it strengthens the relationship with Russia?

5856 2018-06-19 12:36:43 I’m talking about the market that would open. The Middle East isn’t an important market and all that oil money won’t be able to help us with FFP. 

American businessman are richer than middle eastern and their business ties can penetrate the American market like BPL has already
5857 2018-06-19 12:36:29 Wins the late award for missed opportunities in showing real leadership by getting us fully off of oil and the combustion engine?
5858 2018-06-19 12:36:23 I don’t mind getting tough on Chinese trade. We were seen as weak before, and our greed made us this way. Unfortunately, all tariffs do is stifle creativity. In regards to steel, to compete as an industry, innovate. Think shale oil. Tariffs protect non competitive practices.

they're also in my fave salad:

5896 2018-06-19 12:30:28 This article is somewhat absurd. The Fed is not going to give up its hegemony.

5920 2018-06-19 12:28:10 We are now in a cycle where every time oil prices rise too high (because of scarcity), the rest of the economy will take the strain until it breaks, and then a new crisis, new demand destruction, will bring energy prices back in line with what the rest of the economy can bear.

5926 2018-06-19 12:27:30 Someone should probably inform Jeremy Vine that, like olive oil is not "liquid olive", cannabis oil is not "liquid cannabis".
5927 2018-06-19 12:27:29 @sajidjavid @Conservatives @labour @jeremycorbyn OK, so you have issued one cannabis oil license, now set up a website and allow the rest of the UK access to this natural plant based cure... And don't f##k it up like the train time tables #northernfail #CannabisAct -
5928 2018-06-19 12:27:28 JUNE 22, 2018:
It's very unusual for #Nigeria's junior oil minister @FMPRng HM @IbeKachikwu to be silent ahead @OPECnews meeting, not with the raging contentions among member states and contentious @realDonaldTrump tweets, even #Barkindo the Secy. Gen is silent
5929 2018-06-19 12:27:28 Once behind the scenes in a museum I got to look through the layers of oil paint to see sketching on the board underneath. Who says witchcraft isn't real?

5934 2018-06-19 12:26:53 Except the world that you speak of is purchasing oil from us in large quantities and using it to save lives.
5935 2018-06-19 12:26:48 As Scotland cannot currently benefit from the Oil in our waters, the BBC are, for once, correct that this is a problem!

5938 2018-06-19 12:26:15 Don't know if you're aware of this case over here in the UK right now, this young boy has seizures constantly every day started taking marijuana oil and hasn't had one since . Government tried to ban him using it as it's illegal but due to public pressure they have retracted.

5950 2018-06-19 12:24:55 The autocratic regimes around the world are happy AF. China not weeping... couldn’t be happier. Putin loves his high oil prices and probably swiping another country soon. Duterte will probably legalize rape any day now.
5951 2018-06-19 12:24:46 Do they really want to risk being vilified? Last time he did that, they had to order a whole bunch of fighter jets and whatnot. That’s costing them more than the revenue they make in oil sales to the US.

5954 2018-06-19 12:24:30 Nah, not really. I am a weird control freak and that includes imposing restrictions on myself, inc avoid sugary snacks, avoid palm oil, matching pegs on washing, only wear a watch when I'm getting paid. If I relax I will fall to bits!
5955 2018-06-19 12:24:07 Comes down to cost eh? ;-) Better to add cost to the product than cost the earth more. I’m sure you could gain traction by saying palm oil free, and then I could buy your pies again 
5956 2018-06-19 12:24:02 It's not fair to blame Cuba or another country, for something that was oil exploration related, which can cause brain injuries to human beings.  I strongly believe the exploration for oil sonic attackes causes brain injuries.
5957 2018-06-19 12:24:00 Further, I'm sure once I look into the details of Hybrids, a good portion of Profits will likely be channeled abroad to foreign masters in name of "TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER" :-)...PLUS a Double Whammy of continued OIL dependence.

Can see NO other motive, but that of weakening RUPEE
5958 2018-06-19 12:23:42 if we can prescribe methodone for drug addicts. Then cannabis oil for seriously ill children shouldn't ever even be an issue.

5962 2018-06-19 12:23:28 Oil will be a major industry in Canada, particularly Alberta for decades - so this purchase was somewhat expected. However, it's the way in which it happened that is most troubling. Way over projected costs, and the federal gov had to steam roll BC legislature to approve it.
5963 2018-06-19 12:23:18 みたいじゃ無い。書くんだよ！！！君が！！！！！！
5964 2018-06-19 12:23:12 So bought a new car, it's a 2003 SAAB 9-5, I love it so much that it hurt leaving it at the car repair place so they could do an oil change and basically make sure that everything is working properly.
5965 2018-06-19 12:23:09 Definitely hover cycles.
5966 2018-06-19 12:22:58 Just whisk some egg yolks, mustard, vinegar and salt in a bowl till it becomes stable in consistency then add some oil progressively as you continue to whisk to your satisfaction it’s easy.
5967 2018-06-19 12:22:49 will check. problem with so many the health food butters is they often taste too 'raw' because they don't add oil, and then my kids won't eat them. so the 'smooth' part of the oh mega seems appealing.

5971 2018-06-19 12:22:33 FUN FACT FOR THE DAY!!!!! Palm oil only contributes 1% of deforestation in the world. At least 70% of the rest is for animal agriculture AKA to raise cows that you eat so pls don’t eat cows if you care about rainforests thanks!!! 
5972 2018-06-19 12:22:06 Peak oil is well attested. The 2008 financial crisis & attendant energy demand destruction was well on schedule given that world peak oil probably occurred in or around 2006.  I propose no solutions, just point to how we are situated - to which there are better & worse responses.
5973 2018-06-19 12:22:05 @urbanselfdrive 1/4 We were returning yesterday 2 blr. One of the bikes had major fault . No brake fuel, engine oil, brake pad gone. Stuck in the rain on the highway , we again called Urban drive. And we were asked 2 provide the issue details. We did it.
5974 2018-06-19 12:21:56 It gets old when the leaders of our country blame another country, for something they or their interests might be doing.  Often, we get news reports that oil companies want to use SonicWaves for Oil exploration.  The spokes person for the article has oil interests.
5975 2018-06-19 12:21:53 Okay, I've just seen olive oil being suggested, so now I know . Do you leave it on overnight or like an hour before showering? Also, how often should you use it?

5980 2018-06-19 12:20:45 Reason #Haftar chose to concentrate his troops into #Derna despite knowing full well what #Jadhran/BDB were prepping for the OilCrescnt is:

In contrast, protecting the Oil is boring & not spectacular

If you suffer from a pretty bad sunburn, put some apple cider vinegar on a wet washcloth and dab your skin, then apply coconut oil to the burn, let the coconut oil absorb and then apply aloe. Repeat throughout the day.

It works wonders believe me!!!

6039 2018-06-19 12:14:08 Not according to what they’ve just said and @HackneyAbbott is not saying that she’s speaking about the oil on prescription.

6045 2018-06-19 12:12:57 Yep! Although, they do make 96F melting point coconut oil too. I only know this because the 76F one uses a different amount of lye than the 96F degree one in order to make soap. xd

6059 2018-06-19 12:10:41 Have you noticed how these extremist hypocrites become more vocal after several G&Ts and a bottle or two of fine wine? Alcohol, next to cancer is one of the biggest killers known to man, and this from me who enjoys a drink! The ‘oil’ debate simply lacks reason & common sense!
6060 2018-06-19 12:10:40 Good to see William Hague speaking out in favour of CBD oil.  It is non addictive and there's no high.  Can't help wondering if May etc are more concerned about criticism from the Daily Mail reading middle Englanders than understanding the benefits of this medicinal tool.

6066 2018-06-19 12:09:56 @DrPippaM speaking on the impact of technology at #RUSILWC A fabulously inspiring address. Data is the new oil. The ability to capture, process and utilise data is a means of achieving an overwhelming strategic and tactical advantage. Definitely the highlight so far.
6067 2018-06-19 12:09:52 Big Oil Money is aggy garbage btw. Fucking tool
6068 2018-06-19 12:09:51 How could they do well after they left the jerseys we soaked in oil and prayers and wore Saudi Arabia's jersey? @victorchrisO @FadaunsiAdeniyi @afrispheric @segalink

6078 2018-06-19 12:09:12 Sigh. @TigerBrands inform me the stabiliser used in their Black Cat peanut butter is derived from palm oil. 

Back to the drawing board to look for a peanut butter my kids can eat without slashing and burning the environment... 

No snack is worth the destruction.

6079 2018-06-19 12:09:06 We certainly have no problem trying to "save the world" when it allows us to real oil benefits, kill dictators who tried to kill our father or install more US-friendly regimes. But hey, psychological damage to children seems like a much less morally ambigious plan!
6080 2018-06-19 12:09:02 So, Home Office wants to set up a drugs panel to assess medical benefits of cannabs oil.  Why waste time? There is already abundant info on its benefits, so this is just a political blocking move with no merit. Use your usual SI trick & change it now, you fossil!

6082 2018-06-19 12:08:46 The article says it all. @SquawkCNBC @FoxBusiness @MadMoneyOnCNBC and all those other greedy Wall Street BIG OIL frauds take shots at @Tesla every chance they get. I am amazed how low these con men will go to take a USA company down in favor of Foreign TERRORIST OIL CARTELS
6083 2018-06-19 12:08:43 Though the Kochs *are* fanatics, it doesn't take fanaticism for them to be against

6088 2018-06-19 12:07:38 I got a 3% increase on SS benefits, how much has gasoline increased?  Big tax break to oil companies just made them greadier.  Trickle down didn't work for Reagan, didn't work for  Bush and isn't going work for you guys.  GOP just keeps whipping that mule that won't plow.

6092 2018-06-19 12:07:17 Theres these neat gel eye pack things on amazon that you throw in the freezer for about an hour. They help with migraines, headaches, and puffy eyes. Also lavender oil is great. And stress relief lotion on the temples.
6093 2018-06-19 12:07:12 I’m going to create a beach trip simulation machine. Spray you with oil, blast you with UV rays, industrial abrasives then hose you down with a pressure washer. Focus on sensitive areas and in under 2 min you will have achieved the week at the beach look.

6097 2018-06-19 12:06:31 It might be resource intensive, but I’d like to be able to explore submerged buildings like offices and apartment buildings considering the lore you find on the oil rigs. Maybe you can put a loading screen when you dive deep enough, so it’s not as resource intensive.
6098 2018-06-19 12:06:31 Trump and Pruitt are promoting oil and coal and are not interested in alternative energy from biofuels or solar.  Trump is only interested in putting money in the pockets of oil and gas Barron’s. Wake up!

6101 2018-06-19 12:06:13 Wrong. Oil is a finite resource, data isn't. It triggers new forms of extraction and processing and new forms of benefits. Comparison with gold or oil is misleading and narrows the scope of what can be done with data.
6102 2018-06-19 12:06:13 Coconut oil on it’s own mmg natural sunscreen, cuma tak tinggi SPF je. But this is all natural 
6103 2018-06-19 12:06:12 EU just bashes down our products. We have amazing oil, vegetables, corn, wheat, dairy products which are put aside in favor of Turkey and Tunisia unregulated products. Our economy is constantly mined by a EU that doesn't give two shits about us, but leeches our money.

6106 2018-06-19 12:05:59 Especially considering the number of ISR missions (Fr/US) in the area several days before the attack. Haftar was informed. The first units began leaving Derna and reassigned to the Oil Crescent around 7/8 June. 
Haftar could not withdraw his troops from the front of Derna before.

6110 2018-06-19 12:05:41 I'm kinda hoping the word gets out that it's hell to come here now.

Did someone pass a new law? Or did we just start enforcing existing laws?
6111 2018-06-19 12:05:40 Yep, we need to be producing high quality cbd oil for medical purposes so that it's available everywhere and cannabis itself has far less harmful side effects than any other legal drug like alcohol.
6112 2018-06-19 12:05:31 Perfume oil too is expensive there o.
6113 2018-06-19 12:05:27 Everything is soft, like a fresh oil painting.
6114 2018-06-19 12:05:18 #RUSILWC Pippa Malmgren - ‘data is the new oil’. No-brainer, but like oil it needs processing to create the value. That’s the challenge.

6122 2018-06-19 12:04:37 Obama is a confidence man. A slick snake oil salesman peddling policies that have a track record of failure. Read Marx "Communist Manifesto " 1847. Speed of travel was wind and sail or the pace of a walking horse, 3 M.P.H!

6126 2018-06-19 12:04:14 pois amiga, investe um pouquinho mais, tem as coisas da la roche posay que são otimas pra isso, tem o cetaphill.. coisas que tem acido.. aqueles tonicos adstringentes oil free.  e nao lava o rosto mais de 2x ao dia pq pode dar esse efeito reverso do teu corpo produzir mais oleo
6127 2018-06-19 12:04:02 Remove 90% Oil & 80 % Spices from your diet & you will never have any health problem again !!
6128 2018-06-19 12:03:55 Technological advances helped, plus zero cost financing and a high oil price were factors too.
6129 2018-06-19 12:03:40 98 degrees and pregnancy is like Oil and water.
6130 2018-06-19 12:03:25 If there are medically useful substances in cannabis oil they should be isolate, trialled and licensed.

6132 2018-06-19 12:02:46 Hi @dawny741 I don’t want you to think it’s a miracle cure but it did make a difference for my wife,she can’t walk and was really struggling to transfer from wheelchair to bed or to shower chair but since she’s used the oil she is transferring a lot easier with less shaking
6133 2018-06-19 12:02:34 I think Agri minister don't know which import oil is down India mkt so on soya degum govt increase only 5% duty that soya degum import down the ground oil, muster oil mkt and also Indian soybean seed mkt ,If you really think about farmer then qty restriction and 45% duty apply.
6134 2018-06-19 12:02:27 Good to see William Hague backing medicinal CBD oil.  It is non addictive and the psychoactive elements of cannabis are removed.  Can't help wondering whether May and Co are more worried by perceived reactions of Daily Mail readers than the well being of people.  Surely not.
6135 2018-06-19 12:02:18 If China buys Soybeans from Brazil, then Brazil's customers buy from the US mostly.  Same goes for oil, since there isn't alot of surplus capacity in oil right now, demand just shifts.   High tech obviously is difficult because if they violate patents they can't sell around world
6136 2018-06-19 12:02:10 Jesus paid it all, but there’s still a price for the oil.
6137 2018-06-19 12:01:59 I suppose now you know how women feel about seeing boobs in almost everything on cable.
6138 2018-06-19 12:01:34 Man I love Subaru’s but I feel like I gotta fill my oil as much as I fill my gas lol
6139 2018-06-19 12:01:30 The oil is quite affordable in Dubai

6142 2018-06-19 12:01:06 My dog takes Cannabis oil for his epilepsy  you can buy it on the internet and in shops Argentina.  Cannabis oil STOPS epileptic fits. Watching your child or pet suffer fits when the cure is available must be heartbreaking.
6143 2018-06-19 12:01:03 LORD LET THE OIL OF YOUR FAVOUR DROP INTO MY HANDS THIS WEEK.
6144 2018-06-19 12:00:35 ND and IN are the most vulnerable seats. Heitkamp has the roughest time because the State has changed since 2012 the oil boom brought a lot of new conservative leaning men to the state and her relationship with Indian country was damaged after the Dakota Access pipeline.
6145 2018-06-19 12:00:26 @tesco Melton Mowbray porkpies contain palm oil?  I live in the area and I’m pretty sure the palm tree is not naturally occurring in the area. Don’t care if it’s from a sustainable source. Stop using it please.

6152 2018-06-19 11:59:26 Do you know @irrfank that Cannabis oil with high CBD content comes with great promise of curing many types of cancer? Just wanted to let you know what mother nature offers besides doctors hungry of money.

6154 2018-06-19 11:59:24 No, the Dems and Bush never enforced the laws. Maybe America should do the same for Pedofilia and child abuse. Just pick and choose the laws the liberals want to enforce. 

The Bush’s never had a prob separating our military from their children for the oil companies.
6155 2018-06-19 11:59:12 Theresa May promised action months ago to Alfie Dingley's mother concerning use of cannabis oil for treatment of seizures of Epilepsy for Alfie and has done nothing. So many in urgent need of this wonderful medicine. Debate going on today, immediate action required to change law.

6159 2018-06-19 11:58:50 I tried melatonin the other night with mixed results. CBD oil might not be an option in the state much longer. Late last week, the state put something out saying that they consider it's possession illegal in most situations.

6164 2018-06-19 11:57:44 He meant “independent” from PUC, not independent of Sunoco or the oil and gas Pennsylvania’s lobbying organization. Worth remembering: this is PUC’s first ever enforcement action against a hazardous liquid pipeline.
6165 2018-06-19 11:57:37 The odd thing is Jason is that research has ‘conclusively proven’ that the oil (THC) has remarkable properties that help the body to rebuild its immunity, and is very beneficial to cancer, MS and many other deadly illness plagued victims & sufferers! One taboo too many! 
6166 2018-06-19 11:57:35 I didn’t want a part in early 2000s war for oil and westernized bank installation. But fucking humanitarian atrocities???? .......by US.......
6167 2018-06-19 11:57:33 It’s too hard to make analogies between sports tbh soccer is too unique. Amount of available teams, 2/3 simultaneous competitions with different rule sets, and the weird shit going on with all this oil money and financial fair play. I think both sports have it right
6168 2018-06-19 11:57:28 The most likely outcome from the Trump policies will be Russia invading Canada. Then Canadians will have nowhere to go. NAFTA might be just a smoke screen for USA/USSR oil cartel.
6169 2018-06-19 11:57:09 Progressives love mass transit. The idea that The Great Unwashed have complete freedom of movement makes them queasy.
6170 2018-06-19 11:57:08 Great addition. SSA result is particularly interesting and important. I would imagine if you subdivided further that it would show an important divergence between oil producers and importers.
6171 2018-06-19 11:57:05 CBD Oil is such a game changer with sleeping... holy hell
6172 2018-06-19 11:57:04 I've frozen some of these fantastic strawberries and we ate the asparagus cooked in olive oil and salt done on the BBQ. Delicious, will be back soon. 
6173 2018-06-19 11:57:01 Proximity the key. The Mexicans come cash less/job less. Contribute nothing. Arabs come with cash, terrorism/oil deals & towers.
6174 2018-06-19 11:56:51 Elijah did not add to the widow's oil, he multiplied(1 Kings 17:7-16).Jesus did not add to the fish and bread,He multiplied(Matthew 14:13-21).
God does not bless you by addition,He blesses you by multiplication.The the anointing for multiplication shall rest on you in Jesus name.
6175 2018-06-19 11:56:50 It's hard to fathom what possessed him to write it. Doesn't even say good luck or send any good wishes to the team.  The FA should use it as a rag to check the oil with on the team bus.
6176 2018-06-19 11:56:48 In standard conservative reactionary form, in response to the cannabis oil seizure kid, Hague (former tory leader) calls for full recreational weed reform and calls 'the war on cannabis' irrevocably lost.

They're all talk, it's a reactionary jabber.

6180 2018-06-19 11:56:24 Money speaks, corruption at it's best! The British got the #NewAge oil deal to finance the war? France is eating fat from our resources while @AmnestyWARO and @un  sides with the oppressor @PaulBiya .
6181 2018-06-19 11:56:18 Medicinal canabis oil is completely different ,becuase it has a minute amount of illigal canabis in it,i think it should be used,as its mainly oil and has been clinically teated,thats different to the canabis  you were talking about.
6182 2018-06-19 11:56:13 Try @MissPatisserie products they are all natural and smell amazing. The body sugar scrub and body soufflé are my faves. You'll be softer than ever before and as they have almond and rice bran oil very good for the skin and should help the itch! P x

6189 2018-06-19 11:55:37 He is ranked 13 to even as high as mid 20s on most rankings.  Will most definitely be available at 10, so instead of grabbing him at 10 trade down to 12 or 13,get some assets in return then take Smith.

6198 2018-06-19 11:53:21 To shed some light on the matter: Dallas was a tv  show from 1978 - 1991 with 14 seasons. It was about a family in the oil business down in Dallas TX (hence the title) called the Ewings. /2
6199 2018-06-19 11:53:17 Funny. Opec should  produce as much as it can and drive down prices so every producer goes bankrupt then stop producing oil. Damn these politicians are just plain stupid.
6200 2018-06-19 11:53:16 So before 2015 when NC/PDP/Congress were in power Kashmir was a peaceful place......what a joke.....a place like Kashmir will be like heaven & the middle east will have an abundance of crude oil stored beneath the earth of commercial value but Islam cant be practiced in peace

6205 2018-06-19 11:53:05 true! again, EV tech would need to be sufficiently improved over oil based to warrant people accepting to pay an additional Elec tax. Side note, i'd also like to see some larger EV cars from mainstream manufacturers, currently drive a pickup (camping purposes) would want similar
6206 2018-06-19 11:53:00 +- but not 100%. And oil analysis looking very clear and easy  now, comparing to Trumponomics :)

6221 2018-06-19 11:50:40 But US achieved this production through petrodollar funding arising from a completely manipulated oil price (since 2001). My take is China is gearing up a buy-side benchmark challenge with a war chest of 700m bbl of SPR stashed in 3 yrs & support from India for buyer cooperation

This means U ousted 250,000 passenger or at-least 100,000 vehicles off the road.
Which means that by this single act, you saved:
-huge oli consumption, which is the main purpose of public transport.
-Froigne exchange; as oil is over biggest import.
-improve balance of payment

6238 2018-06-19 11:48:40 I think the Audit Report released a few weeks ago added quite a bit to the existing atmosphere of antagonism in #Libya. It also produced this impression that oil income was going to waste or being embezzled anyhow.

Me, personally, I disliked that report bcos it was not balanced.
6239 2018-06-19 11:48:36 Agreed, I'm pushing myself harder to reduce palm oil for one thing. Palm oil and may contains are something of opinion, not as cut and dry as bacon. This is oreos position

6260 2018-06-19 11:45:44 The amazing thing is that the very people who elected Trump are the ones that he is screwing with the tariffs, healthcare, taxes and other policies. And yet he keeps stroking them for support and they blindly soak up his bull sh*t. It’s all snake oil.

6263 2018-06-19 11:45:03 It's very sad how many job opportunities have been lost since Trump got elected in solar and wind and other renewable energies he still trying to figure out clean coal and encourage drilling for oil along our coastlines setting up potential disasters in waiting.

6269 2018-06-19 11:44:13 We were doing work with a company developing magnetic anomaly detector for oil rigs to accurately plot a drill progress it's normally towed behind a ship but they wanted to fly it which we couldn't understand then it dawned on us it was for fracking so we stopped helping them
6270 2018-06-19 11:43:53 Capital flight is a big issue so we need to quickly sell licences to new oil fields and impose a decommission tax on the existing ones to raise capital.

6284 2018-06-19 11:41:49 Wrong. We sell oil to USA cheap. Under market. Only way is Pipeline to make it profitable
6285 2018-06-19 11:41:39 Lovely take,  base metals /EV metals bulls, oil bulls will find the going tough over next few months , too much froth and needs to be worked off IMHO
6286 2018-06-19 11:41:33 But, but, but...ethical oil!

I love when someone uses the ethical oil argument and then refers to Ezra's terrible screed. As if Ezra has even a passing association with anything ethical.
6287 2018-06-19 11:41:27 good point, and let's not forget that the US is a huge oil supplier itself and so no longer reliant upon the ME for it's energy, and maintaining a military presence out there is hugely expensive.

6294 2018-06-19 11:40:50 Nothing has changed from that call, 3% level held, oil didn't break toward $85 and still looking for a yield inversion which mean the 10 year yield should head lower. Still, need oil to break under $59

6297 2018-06-19 11:40:39 Seen as its in the news at the moment now would be a really good time for us to push for legalisation of cannabis/cannabis oil for the treatment of chronic conditions - it has potential to be life changing for so many
6298 2018-06-19 11:40:33 Oil US$74.8/bbl vs US$73.8/bbl yesterday
6299 2018-06-19 11:40:32 Market reminding one that it can go up & down. Feels like it in a mood to humble all. If oil goes ala gold the pain will extend from EM forex to luxury, semi’s etc. Anyone else remember Summer 2007?!? Running risk was hard then. Same again I fancy

I have zero problem with immigration. They must assimilate. 

immigration without assimilation = invasion.
6307 2018-06-19 11:39:46 And to think the New Scientist was pretty much required reading when I worked in research for a major oil company.

6327 2018-06-19 11:37:09 @sajidjavid Hi Javid, we should be following Canada's lead and make THC Cannabis oil legal in the UK. Cannabis EBD is already legal but doesn't have the health benefits of THC. Still make cannabis and skunk itself illegal as that is thin edge of the wedge to much harder drugs.
6328 2018-06-19 11:37:08 An smoking it is like smoking 10 cigarettes so lung disease is higher then best benefits from it is oil it treats everything
6329 2018-06-19 11:37:04 We all know that the reason, our young people are dying in these futile and continuous infightings, has nothing to do with “borders” but it is a way of hiding the real issue.
These two administrations, each one, wants to control oil rich area of Holhol without local pples’ will.
6330 2018-06-19 11:37:03 Legalising cannabis is a got idea on medical grounds, then the oil can be used, I do however disagree with smoking it. Living in a flat next to people who smoked it was annoying.

6357 2018-06-19 11:33:59 It might for some but not for me. However THC India oil works every time with no side effects.

6367 2018-06-19 11:33:02 my cinnamon essential oil spilled and it’s really gross in this heavy of a concentration. (I’m going to Puerto Rico in December I just wanted to hide it in a dumb tweet so I can be excited but not bragging.) I wonder if the smell will last forever. Heck.

6443 2018-06-19 11:23:57 There is a big difference between smoking cannabis and taking the oil for medicinal purposes.  It's been shown that smoking can permanently impair brain function and also lead to the taking of harder drugs.  Medicinal cannabis should be made available.

6456 2018-06-19 11:22:41 This is an argument that legalisation makes research that may lead to novel treatments easier and one that I endorse. It's not an argument to give kids uncontrolled cannabis oil based on tiny self reporting studies.

6458 2018-06-19 11:22:30 Cannabis oil for medicinal use is causing a stir because... it's dangerous? Might be accidentally pleasurable? Currently, as a form of pain relief where cannabis oil would fit the bill, I am using Morphine. Morphine is deadly. All due to to Tory ignorance and baseless prejudice.

$1 for each barrel of oil? What does that mean? Where does the dollar come from, and who is keeping it?
6514 2018-06-19 11:12:46 @theJeremyVine 
So sad that the nhs won’t prescribe cannabis oil to help a genuinely ill child. Especially when it is diverting time and funds to treating so called video game addicts
6515 2018-06-19 11:12:46 Bottom line it will call psychosis for some users. To legalise it, is to signal that use is completely safe. Decriminalisation is a better approach - treat the users and jail the drug lords. If oil derivatives safe for medicinal purposes, this should be legal on prescription
6516 2018-06-19 11:12:42 ...There’s an app and/or essential oil for that

I also have that same oil, contaminated with Something

2. of someone I can pay to do that & help interpret results, and
3. how much that sort of thing costs
6523 2018-06-19 11:11:49 The oil with THC should be legalised for medicinal purposes for sure.
6524 2018-06-19 11:11:49 So true. I had the same thing in my mind. 2013 bhakts be like petrol is too expensive. Throw the govt out. 2018 bhakts be like let petrol be costly, the money govt earns through crude oil goes towards development  wtf

6527 2018-06-19 11:11:40 Interesting wrap, but I'd disagree that "the oil industry is not prepared for this transition" If you speak to Exxon etc they've been preparing for over a decade for this. With huge investments globally in secondary refining units there is spare capacity in middle distillates
6528 2018-06-19 11:11:36 They should do the same with all loans and the oil revenue sharing agreement.   Very corrupt people.

6544 2018-06-19 11:09:32 I'm all for legalising the use of cannibis oil if it truly helps illnesses. For recreational use, not at all. It will only create more issues and more gateway users. I see no positives there.
6545 2018-06-19 11:09:32 Obama drilled more oil, deported more illegals, and killed more terriost than any other President. He just doesn't separate families, not controlled by Russia, or cheats on his wife.

6597 2018-06-19 11:00:02 First it was diesel from a rock and grown men, ministers, so-called educated men went to Chinhoyi to a witch doctor to get a crude oil by-product from a rock.....they stole the electuins after that and we still thought of them as sane individuals

6604 2018-06-19 10:59:45 #BackInTimeAU Hang on, they were allowed to buy olive oil from the chemist in the 1950s, because they were Italian. Are they supposed to have forgotten their heritage and stopped using it by the 80s?

6616 2018-06-19 10:56:57 @MacroVoices for a deepdive into the world of finance and macro economics! What is quantative easing? How is the oil price affected by a trump tweet? Are we returning to a gold backed currency system? All these topics are coverd and tied into a current events backdrop!
6617 2018-06-19 10:56:55 My fitness app tells me to order the @Whataburger B.O.B without the second B. Insanity! You can’t eat a Breakfast on a Bun without the unbleached enriched flour (wheat flour, malted barley flour, niacin, reduced iron, thiamin mononitrate, riboflavin, folic acid), oil and yeast!!

6621 2018-06-19 10:56:09 Resort tycoons with billion dollar corporations don't need predatory business practices like destroying natural habitats and fencing off inhabited islands to do business. But they're too greedy just like wealthy oil tycoons who'll literally destroy the planet to get richer.

6624 2018-06-19 10:55:21 Oh. Don't get me wrong. There maybe applications. CBD oil is already legal.

6634 2018-06-19 10:53:32 All I hear is whining and demagoguery.  Not 1 time, on ANY news program have I ever heard a solution.  I've been told relentlessly it's not who we are. OK.
Now what do we do about it?
6635 2018-06-19 10:53:19 My Lords say short sellers, an oil and gas co, and a foreign government agency were involved with the sabotage that Elon described. The main actor being the oil and gas co. Anyway, I can get more specific if my Lords desire to weigh further in. Names would be helpful right?

6647 2018-06-19 10:51:01 I wonder..if Rainby and Obsidian decide to have a kid (maybe), would the baby be like an oil baby?

Like his flames are pitch-black, but also rainbow. Kind of like how motor oil looks but with fire, if that makes any sense.
6648 2018-06-19 10:50:42 Woah! So there’s oil in Carrots? Had no idea.
6649 2018-06-19 10:50:40 You never know... If it was made available on prescription you might be able to stop the Fluoxitine and just take the oil. Lets see what these Tory fascists say in their statement today. I won't hold my breath.

6658 2018-06-19 10:49:13 Of course it's demand. Gas always goes up in the summer, but I guarantee when Ford gives us the 10 cent break.... we'll see oil companies profits go up, not the price going down. Corporate greed.
6659 2018-06-19 10:49:07 The Govt actually have no argument against. We have licensed growers (one being the husband of a Tory MP) for companies (one that Mr May has shares in) that produce medicinal oil. If it was that terrible why are they granting licences?
6660 2018-06-19 10:49:07 Too many politicians have interests in pharmaceutical companies. Cannabis oil is going to help make a lot of people well. That’s not good for the business of the pharmaceutical industry.
6661 2018-06-19 10:48:45 Medical Cannabis Oil shouldn't need a Licence when The #HomeOffice Gave GW pharmaceutical a Licence, to make money from Cannabis, After they Called it Raw Cannabis... Why can't we Add the word Raw To Medical Cannabis Oil, to make it Legal, if pharmaceutical company's can...

6670 2018-06-19 10:46:58 Haigh had to do it. The discussion was of cannabis oil for medical purposes which might of carried the day. Now by introducing the subject of legalising the drug he has put back help for the sick for ages!
6671 2018-06-19 10:46:49 The exact same thing? Clearly you’re not across this.
6672 2018-06-19 10:46:44 @arunjaitley Jettisoning  AI divestment on pretext of higher oil prices is a disaster.

Not 1 time have I heard ANYONE doing the whining present a solution.  What is it?
6680 2018-06-19 10:44:55 Will may i enquire why you want to try CBD oil, rather than try to sell you something, message me to see how best for you to try

6683 2018-06-19 10:44:29 Indian market is not going to correct more than 10%. Why? Because humare paas Modi aur strong sip flow hain. Notebandi, GST, currency, interest rate, oil price, CAD, Agricomm prices, - - yeh sub toh fizool ki baatein hain! Right?
6684 2018-06-19 10:44:26 I  don't think those shifts are big oil.  We should check it out but I think the oscillation in price is due to the demand at the time.
6685 2018-06-19 10:44:17 เย้ๆๆๆ ค้างคืนมั้ยฮะ

6689 2018-06-19 10:43:42 William Hague has called for recreational cannabis to be decriminalised. Telegraph comment predictable. Not sure what I think. Medicinal cannabis (cbd oil) should definitely be available on NHS
6690 2018-06-19 10:43:18 I think you might be confusing weed with cannabis oil. They are two entirely different things. No similarity at all. I think, if you research, you will find that cannabis oil is not addictive and does not lead to mental illness etc.

6692 2018-06-19 10:42:35 What is the solution?
Not once have I heard any pundit or politician present one.

6720 2018-06-19 10:36:17 We have more oil, natural gas and coal than they do, and the Israelis just recently discovered a vast amount of oil, right?
6721 2018-06-19 10:36:17 Thank you for this kaka. It seems to me that beyond political isolation, communities may be driven to consider food security as a primary objective, e.g. with Kenya's looming debt crisis, and with oil crisis and climate change implying that global supplies are unreliable

6725 2018-06-19 10:35:22 Why “just the oil”? What about other edibles? What about vaping? Smoking is legal btw so that’s an absurd argument.

6737 2018-06-19 10:32:37 Have you ever wanted to do 100 in your truck, open the door, roll out, and then walk away like an action hero as your truck slams into a brick wall or an oil truck?

Me neither...
6738 2018-06-19 10:32:35 They supposedly have at least 11 m/bpd of capacity. Back in the heady days of $100+ per barrel oil, KSA claimed to be getting to 12.5 m/bpd by 2009. Don't know if they ever got there.
6739 2018-06-19 10:32:34 My mom gave me “sleepy oil”
Me “mom it tastes just like edibles”
Mom *dripping the oil in her mouth* “na uh”
I can’t tell if she’s playing dumb or she really don’t know but FACTS she gave me weed oils and I ain’t complaining 
6740 2018-06-19 10:32:24 And doesn’t do oil painting
6741 2018-06-19 10:32:11 Is that like every hour or so? Might as well drink flaxseed oil instead of eating real food.
6742 2018-06-19 10:31:39 Ruffhouse is the best then put rosin chips in the Herbal Infuser to make insane butter,oil & tincture. Also check out @RosinUnity 
6743 2018-06-19 10:31:07 Everyone is a critic. Not one so far has offered a solution. All I hear is whining and more nazi talk.  I repeat, not one pundit or any leftist politician has offered ANY solution.
6744 2018-06-19 10:30:57 This, above. I’d fry in a really hot pan with some nice olive oil and salt
6745 2018-06-19 10:30:44 .@LBC .@mrjamesob Just received in the post some ***LEGAL*** CBD 20% oil purchased for my Mr to see if we can aleviate his PD and dementia symptoms. Fingers crossed. 
6746 2018-06-19 10:30:43 Sorry @DStrandberg we send the @VWRacingCup the oil and haven't heard that they didn't arrive. We'll check it now - thank's for letting us know.

6766 2018-06-19 10:27:09 I agree , but its not about out the gate - its about pensioners.

A pegged new one , for a term , means no fear to install - unlike last indy ref.

Then its about pegging/floating between our export and import markets - and selling oil in Scots pound soon after.
6767 2018-06-19 10:26:59 It was inevitable after the successful taxing of it in the US. Tories are all about profit and taxes.. but still, this is a step in the right direction, cannabis oil especially is a miracle waiting to happen for the British public.. plus, we've been the biggest exporter for years
6768 2018-06-19 10:26:54 @bendepear Ben you need a reporter with epilepsy to cover the now headline cannabis CBD oil story, you need some balance and some investigation. Pls do get in touch
6769 2018-06-19 10:26:43 Xsure la betul ke tak pasal natural oil whatsoever tu, tapi my mom mmg nampak muda. Xnampak like 60 pun. Same goes to my aunts and me myself

6774 2018-06-19 10:25:54 The medicinal cannabis oil confiscated contained very little thc, I believe, which means the latter point isn’t a reason for it to be banned. Please correct me if wrong ;)
6775 2018-06-19 10:25:52 Can we just be clear CBD oil is not the same as the cannabis that people smoke. @bbchealth keep saying 'cannabis' . It would be more helpful to call CBD oil a Hemp oil. It has no THC

You take their resources,  You take their oil, gold, you make a lot of money and build your homes beautiful, you live them in devastation.

You have ‘again’ gone back on your word and broken a mums heart over legalising ‘medicinal cannabis oil’ for a whole range of disabilities? This because you feel it would lead to other substance abuse? Absurd & archaic!
You’d prefer they depended on street dealers?
6805 2018-06-19 10:21:36 Prescription drugs are much more harmful than cannabis oil in it s purest form, legalization would stop the growing of super skunk which is the most harnful of this natural plant because of what man is doing to it. regulate,control and tax

6881 2018-06-19 10:09:33 Hi! You can remove the tattoos easily with baby oil and tissue. It will take about 1 minute or so. Just make sure you keep away from your eyes and mouth, so as to avoid harmful ingestion of anything.
6882 2018-06-19 10:09:32 incorrect, the medica have given the boy a mix of cbd nd thc, ie cannais oil. i have a strong feeling its becuase they hold a lack of knowledge and dont know that there are quality products that have a legal amount of cbd and thc in them,

6884 2018-06-19 10:08:37 Yes to use of medicinal cannabis oil and 100% no to recreational use , I’ve worked with over 6000 teens in the last 12 years and 99% if there issues are made worse by or caused by weed and it really is a gateway drug
6885 2018-06-19 10:08:21 Why are stories about the use of cannabis oil being used to talk about decriminalising/legalising the drug. They are two different things and should be treated as such.

6888 2018-06-19 10:07:27 if it helped to regulate strength and not fuel a black market in high strength skunk then maybe there's a case for it - but it's tricky.   Would legalising help moderate MH effects, or fuel an epidemic?   It's not clear cut.   For medical use, however, cannabis oil is no-brainer

Well I've played naughty twister but not with oilwould that even be possible
6895 2018-06-19 10:06:35 I use cannabis oil n will continue to do so regardless that in the "eyes" of the law its illegal - it helps with my pain & is more beneficial to my health than the concoction of prescription meds.
6896 2018-06-19 10:06:26 Typical Arab Mindset! The tragedy is such crazy regimes have the Oil dollars to  exploit and realize such dreams.

6901 2018-06-19 10:05:23 On the legalization of cannabis i support it but i'm also pragmatic & for now it should be cannabis&cannabis oil for medicinal purposes only that's legalized as a starting point
6902 2018-06-19 10:04:59 Woke up put Sky Sports News on, it was adverts so switched to Sky News, 1st story was of the Child Migrant issue in America. After that I put on BBC news an they were debating the issue of Cannabis Oil for sick Children. What a big mess we're in.

6906 2018-06-19 10:04:32 I think this cannabis oil should be legalised. There are children who needs this to treat their epilepsy! What don’t some MPs get. If the medical profession have said it’s okay what’s the problem! #CannabisOil #VictoriaDerbyshire

6910 2018-06-19 10:03:56 You can fault that to the deep in oil prices. What was done when the oil was at its peak?  The administration is not doing enough. Yes! But let it breath.
6911 2018-06-19 10:03:45 Yep that’s dicamba...AMS can blister especially with an oil tank mixed but that’s dicamba...
6912 2018-06-19 10:03:43 Appreciate eating ruminants is not an option from a religious perspective in many areas-Perhaps the fact that cows are indeed such "magical" creatures that they can eat grass and make it 100% fat is in fact why they are venerated ?  and eating sat fat even if coconut oil is good?
6913 2018-06-19 10:03:33 Been reading this nonsensical argument..don't use oil as it is from Islamic nations..this is bullshit. We are buying it for money, it is not free. We have choice and the sellers have a choice.
6914 2018-06-19 10:03:33 Emerging suffered because oil and debts mismanagement ..  trade war between them helps the emerging in fact .. not buying from US soybeans means they buy from countries like Argentina. So they can fight whatever they want. I'm preparing popcorn.
6915 2018-06-19 10:03:23 Agreed. I personally rasa leceh pakai cleansing oil sebab kena pakai second cleanser afterwards, so selalu pakai water-based makeup remover or micellar water.
6916 2018-06-19 10:02:57 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.

6930 2018-06-19 10:00:50 i don't believe double cleanse is a must. be flexible about it. cleansing  oil isn't compulsory. some ppl use gel type, micellar water type. some just use single cleanser to wash their face. some ppl need triple quadruple or n-tuple cleansing to remove their makeup

6951 2018-06-19 09:55:34 That is the same terrorist that asked for 20 million people to be wiped out of the Niger Delta so that Nigeria can drill oil and gas unhindered. His day will surely come.

6955 2018-06-19 09:55:08 I cant eat peanut butter , because of the rapeseed oil. If it’s fresh peanut butter w/o having rapeseed , then I can eat it. Too much of a good thing can be a bad thing, not spiritual, just common sense.
6956 2018-06-19 09:54:57 Also, I recently chopped off the outer corner of my eyelashes with a nail clipper and I did a DIY of my own lash growth treatment made with vitamin E oil and coconut oil and to say the least I also want to write a bad review on myself. Ughhh.

Apart from some info on life expectancy, personally I do not think there is anything “educational” in the price of oil recent change, that Jaguar makes Discovery in Slovakia, or ECB and QE etc.

This is just noise that clients should stay away from it. My opinion
6965 2018-06-19 09:53:46 The moment has arrived to legalise medical marijuana, especially for children/adults suffering seizures, and are benefiting by treatment of CBD oil. After exhausting all other medical treatments it is the sane thing to do. Legalisation of recreational cannabis will follow.

6967 2018-06-19 09:53:37 What I see, traveling in West Texas, is the rise in costs to rent a motel room, because the oil people are filling up all the motels, as oil and gas is booming here. Rooms used to be about $89.00 a night. Now they are $400.00 to $600.00 a night.

6973 2018-06-19 09:52:23 I can't get the sight of all those children who's lives have been destroyed by the ' Good 'ol' USA' in the quest for oil and Capitalism's greed.
6974 2018-06-19 09:51:55 Gibraltar has some reliance on Scotland, probably more than many realise, they call it bunkering (supplying fuel to shipping)
I suspect Gibraltar may be one of those "unknown regions" where Scottish fuel and Oil goes.
Sacrificing Scotland may mean sacrificing Gibraltar...

6978 2018-06-19 09:50:42 Because Israel have forcefully removed them from their homes, pushed them to the very east coast of their land and taken oil reserves that could have seen their country prosper.
6979 2018-06-19 09:50:30 Do you feel that the sale of stolen oil from Syria is a crime?  Do you feel that those who purchased same are criminals and criminal enablers?  What do you feel our government should have done about this historically?
6980 2018-06-19 09:50:22 I spent an enlightening hour at a cafe last week where an older lady held forth at length to her friend about how "we can't fund anything because we've run out of coal and oil" so a Labour government is not feasible and Brexit must happen. What's economics, preciousssss?
6981 2018-06-19 09:50:16 Coffee and Coconut Oil as a body scrub combo is too beautiful, skin feels amazing 
6982 2018-06-19 09:50:10 I’ve got a better one for you. 

A small can of WD40 is even better. It stings but also coats the eyes in oil so they can’t see. Perfectly legal to carry, cos my pen sometimes is squeaky.
6983 2018-06-19 09:49:56 @CarolineLucas @CrispinBlunt Thank you for voicing mine and I’m guessing 99% of others thoughts on medicinal cannabis oil so plainly on Victoria live earlier. I’m not a fan of the Tories, but in this case, Crispin Blunt deserves praise too. Shame on Teresa May!

This abstract complex feeling, i just dont know how to handle them. Should i throw oil on one of these wounds? But which one?

6996 2018-06-19 09:45:41 Yeah and there's been less indoor plumbing, too. Never said you should hate all of Libya for the results of a coup almost 50 years ago, just saying you should hate the thuggish army brat that swanned about in robes for decades getting rich off oil sales and blowing up planes
6997 2018-06-19 09:45:37 And pretty sure btw that the oil platforms they're trying to drag into the Arctic (at beginning of that video and Norway being chief amongst these) will be taken out by the various 30 metre high ice floes breaking off the land & being flung around arctic by winds.
6998 2018-06-19 09:45:37 Gibraltar and Scotland are tied up in trade far more than one might think, (Oil & Fuel for shipping: bunkering) though I suspect Gibraltar may well be one of those "unknown region" candidates.

7038 2018-06-19 09:39:00 I’m only backing legalising medical cannabis oil, the media seem to have conflated the two very separate issues.. Of course Theresa May & Victoria Atkins are looking out for thier husbands interests, not sick children..

7047 2018-06-19 09:37:08 Considering that we have spent millions on oil exploration & continue to spend more in Chad Basin, this should've been done even before we started looking for crude in that region. But of course 'the more patriotic' politicians know better #RestructureNigeria
7048 2018-06-19 09:37:03 Good for environment! Will save foreign exchange on oil imports!
7049 2018-06-19 09:36:33 It is so sad to believe that children are suffering in this world due to an out of date drugs policy. One drop of an oil that is produced naturally can cure and even prevent deaths. #LegalizeIt

7053 2018-06-19 09:35:52 This is heartbreaking!!! For goodness sake give these children the cannabis oil NOW!!! Common sense should prevail... what if it was your child???
7054 2018-06-19 09:35:41 That’s some intense late night action 
7055 2018-06-19 09:35:36 Cannabis should be made legal especially for people who need cannabis oil for epilepsy I bet if teresa may needed it for any children she had she would legalise it straight away this woman is a disgrace she needs to step down and move a side now
7056 2018-06-19 09:35:35 So... you get to choose whether your personality and anyone's else personality will collide or go along smoothly despite the defferinces. Oil and water won't mix... but in terms of physics positive and negative charges will attract. It's all about your perspective.
7057 2018-06-19 09:35:33 Let's be clear, legalisation of CBD oil for medicinal use and the legalisation of cannabis for recreational use are two very different things. Those piggy backing on the plight of Billy Caldwell and other epileptic kids to get recreational use legalised are putting them at risk.
7058 2018-06-19 09:35:28 And while Norway may have smaller oil reserves they are in geologically and geographically more favorable locations; with a less aging infrastructure; and therefore considerably cheaper to extract.

Nowt else of any value
7061 2018-06-19 09:35:20 Agreed. Some original films can get too wrapped up in themselves and forget to establish what they are. A franchise already knows what it is. It's like creating a machine. An original idea is creating something new and hope it works. A franchise is adding new gears and oil.
7062 2018-06-19 09:35:20 You can Legalise Cannabis Oil for Medical use dispensed on prescription by doctor to people who have medical conditions it can help. MP's playing politics with sick adults &, children's lives is disgusting
7063 2018-06-19 09:35:01 to anyone using the skunk buzzwords. Cannabis oil is nothing but an concentrated extract of the psychoactive parts of cannabis.
Think 10 ones stronger and no plant matter!

7067 2018-06-19 09:33:21 Fiscal transfer is part of pooling and sharing; but you have to admit that the current and future trends indicate that the fiscal transfer will be towards Scotland, not from it. The oil revenue funded UK infrastructure, brought lower taxation to individuals and corporations.

If so, it could show global leadership from both palm oil & PKE side of things.

7194 2018-06-19 09:10:15 @VictoriaLIVE can't see the govt legalising cannabis while their Big Pharma cronies are still making huge money from the NHS for drug treatments that would no longer be necessary if cannabis oil became a licensed drug.
7195 2018-06-19 09:09:35 Really annoyed that the legalize cannibis campaign is piggy backing on the plight of the recent medical, cannibis oil case. Treat them seperate, get the medical use legalized, especially as we produce it for countries where legal. THEN address the recreational use.

7211 2018-06-19 09:06:26 I don't have to follow the news or social media to know what happening in my region (Oil Crescent) or my tribe (El-Maghariba).

7212 2018-06-19 09:06:16 #VictoriaLIVE there is a big difference in using approved cannabis oil 4 medicinal purpose 2 growing your own plants. Many ppl, not all, with Epilepsy have mental health issues I.e. depression etc. Cannabis oil with its pyschotropic values isn't ideal for these issues.

7243 2018-06-19 08:59:28 Also, it is not at all accurate to claim that the attack is covered by the Magharba tribe. Majority of the PFG under the LNA are made up of the Magharba ... the Magharba fighting the Magharba in the oil crescent? Also, statement by Saleh Latwaish ... etc.

7274 2018-06-19 08:53:40 The two substances are incredibly different & shouldn't be confused. Medicinal cannabis oil has no psychoactive effects or side effects. That's why it so vital that patients can have access to the right product. Medicinal cannabis is legal & can be bought but should be on NHS rx

7317 2018-06-19 08:43:41 Clear positive evidence for medical use of cannabis oil. Yes. But I worry legalising general use would encourage more smoking of it mixed with tobacco, smoking is a killer and young people see it as cool to smoke it. So cannabis oil for medical purposes only.

Therefore while the devaluation option is the least confrontational, maybe China's response has to be the dumping of bonds.

7405 2018-06-19 08:23:17 Too bad. No matter how filled I am, once I see dt food, I am buying some. D oil is part of the garment dt beans need to flourish alongside d stew. Maybe d one u ate wasn't properly prepared.
7406 2018-06-19 08:22:56 Thank you, I appreciate the info. I'm in remission as of now, and hoping to stay here. I would never do chemo ever again, but I've heard a lot about the cannabis oil. Would try that, hope I stay healthy.

ThePalestinians will get their sack of flour and rice and oil from @UNRWA. THEY don't need to grow food to sustain themselves. so they have time to burn fields in #Israel. They know we can't burn barren sand dunes.

7421 2018-06-19 08:20:11 Two of these items miss the point. 
Union bashing instead of blaming badly run rail services. Cannabis oil is an important medication and helps millions. Other more progressive countries don't ban it.

7423 2018-06-19 08:20:01 Cannabis oil will never be allowed 2 be freely prescribed in UK sadly.Its propensity 4 relief &cure are now well  known.The big pharmaceutical companies are terrified.They've sat on this knowledge,hidden results, threatened.This is real reason.Their profits would suffer.

7436 2018-06-19 08:15:53 There are so many case histories of people being helped/cured by this oil but it makes no money for the big Pharmaceutical companies. Will they try to block it?

7441 2018-06-19 08:15:22 We add a small amount of sustainable palm oil to some of our nut butters as it helps to stabilise the product and stops it from separating. We produce 100% Nuts peanut butters, too, which simply contain peanuts.
7442 2018-06-19 08:15:12 thats a strong second place for me. balsamic vinegar is an underrated dip as well. put it on a plate with olive oil and dip some baguette slices in there, with some grapes on the side? height of luxury
7443 2018-06-19 08:14:59 Just milk and flour, keep the dough in the fridge once the culture stabilises so it tastes better, and bake a whole lot of little breadsticks once a week. When treated this way, it doesn't even need kneading. The bread keeps well frozen, or add oil to keep soft at room temp.
7444 2018-06-19 08:14:43 Very valid point. Many of the most successful bankers didn't study banking and finance. The CEOs of upstream oil companies need not be geologist or petroleum engineers. At the very top level, technical skill is not d most important factor.
7445 2018-06-19 08:14:40 Clear positive evidence for medical use of cannabis oil. Yes. But I worry legalising general use would encourage more smoking of it mixed with tobacco, smoking is a killer and young people see it as cool to smoke it. So cannabis oil for medical purposes only.
7446 2018-06-19 08:14:12 I use pure 150mg tincture of THC oil. It lifts me to another dimension!

7540 2018-06-19 07:58:35 Tea Tree Oil has been known to irritate eyes, and if there is any broken skin it normally burns and doesn’t do any good. It shouldn’t do anything unless you get it directly in your eyes though?
7541 2018-06-19 07:58:32 So, the wholesale price of oil rose 5 % recently and our petroleum price instantly rose  circa 10% - now the oil price has dropped 10% in front of the opec meet and not a drop in our patrol price - surprised ? Hardly ! But so fed up og being ripped off here in the UK !!
7542 2018-06-19 07:58:26 Sorry I keep RTing so much. I’m just stressed out and can’t sleep. Going to give it another try. That  CBD oil can’t show up fast enough at this point.

7545 2018-06-19 07:58:00 Only cannabis oil should be legalised for medical use
7546 2018-06-19 07:57:58 Peter, do you think its fine that we prescribe opioids by the million every day, but no room for much less detrimental cannabis oil?

7548 2018-06-19 07:57:38 Oil Prices were higher, recouping some of their recent losses, as traders assessed escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China.

7550 2018-06-19 07:57:22 Mother and child is befitting. Perhaps you'd prefer a euphemism for kowtow. Parliament, regardless of political stripe, factors the U.S. into policy, not so true of Congress. Canada supplies U.S. oil, the U.S. vies for energy independence, Canada keeps its currency low etc.
7551 2018-06-19 07:57:20 Palm oil is often descibed as vegetable oil how many vegan buy products containing it?
7552 2018-06-19 07:57:06 It's okay for #May's husband to benefit from the sale of  medicinal Canabis, but they got around that by   creating a new descriptor, the plant they now refer to as RAW Canabis, so they are now able to sell Canabis Oil for medicinal purposes at £125 per 10mls.

7565 2018-06-19 07:55:04 After recapturing the oil terminals, the LNA won't stop there. Next stops: Sirte and Bani Walid. Senior figures already confirmed that both cities were used as bases by the forces that attacked the oil terminals. Remember: Sirte has the strategic Ghardabyia airbase. #Libya
7566 2018-06-19 07:54:57 But they're selling CBD oil in Holland and Barrett. It sold out on its first day in my town. So I don't see the issue.
7567 2018-06-19 07:54:22 These MMT economists are basically using the same tricks that pyramid scheme sellers use, they fail to mention that whilst the money will be there, the cost of living will rise exponentially, causing huge inflation. They are selling snake oil and idiots buy into it.

7572 2018-06-19 07:52:52 i still consider Gaddafi the best Africa ever had. education and medication were free for the people. it was not US alone. Britain and France were scared of an african imperialist and shared tge oil and gold. as libya still fights the three are benefitting
7573 2018-06-19 07:52:30 It is indeed. I read a book a long time ago that suggested oil could be simply a planetary by-product instead of a "fossil" fuel because of how common hydrocarbons are throughout the solar system. Also that geology~astronomy. We just live on the subject of investigation.
7574 2018-06-19 07:52:29 Hi there. I work for Channel 4 News' digital team - we're looking to speak to people who use cannabis oil. Would you be able to DM? Thank you.

7576 2018-06-19 07:51:50 doctors should be able to prescribe cannabis oil or other medical cannabis treatments but I'm against a total legalisation of it. Some people I know take it and you can tell their off their face and wired and that's only cannabis they are taking #Cannabis

7679 2018-06-19 07:30:55 They kill people and put pressure on our lives. They sit on a treasure trove of oil and gold and a lot of mines, but they still get heavy taxes from people and do not have any facilities. If we protest, they will respond to jail and torture. They took us hostage.

It isn’t drinking water. (I worked in oil field long ago)

8027 2018-06-19 06:21:59 @maddow Here’s an interesting reason for Trump canceling the Iran deal.
Russia exports 5.2 million barrels of oil a day. Trump loves Putin remember.
The approximate rise of per barrel at $20-25 would give Putin a wonderful gift of around $130 million a day in increased revenue!
8028 2018-06-19 06:20:52 Unpopular opinion time: 
I am a massive supporter of the legalisation of cannabis for recreational use. 
However I think to make big steps forward the U.K. needs to go slowly, we first need slightly more relaxed regulation on the use of cannabis oil for medication first

8228 2018-06-19 05:44:21 Look up the word ‘hyperinflation’, a word that tends to go with Socialism.

Socialism is so disastrous a policy that it can cause even the world’s biggest oil producer to run out of money.

8240 2018-06-19 05:41:27 Is the "upper limiting values of a grease" determined by the drop point (thickener) or maximum serviceable temperature of the base oil? Often only drop points are only considered when specifying greases when base oil vapour pressure and oxidation stability are equally important.

UPA Govt didn't take loan wth Oil bonds, WE contributed our money to the banking system to ease pressure of oil imports.

NDA govt doesn't repay our bonds with interest. WE are getting our money back from the banking system with a little interest.

8288 2018-06-19 05:33:12 I know. The problem is, nobody challenges the narrative, nobody is protesting for pipelines, and for a chance of making their lives better. By all means, be concerned about the environment, but we also need the money. Shutting down Alberta oil only serves foreign dictators.

8345 2018-06-19 05:21:14 No need to sense it, I own that argument. If Alberta reduces emissions, de-carbonizes its heavy crude oil, it earns the right to sell its product on global markets (and get it to market). Alberta/Canada are the good guys, we should support them, not shut them down.

8352 2018-06-19 05:20:50 Guy did a better one awhile back. I seem to have lost my link. But the point remains the same. It was once ideal to burn whale blubber/oil for light. It doesn’t mean it’s a good idea today ya know? Lots of old ideas that need to be rethought.

In that dark period, Gowon signed off the entire oil/gas reserves of Eastern Nigeria
8358 2018-06-19 05:20:11 Nothing special. Just toss them with olive oil, a little salt, some black pepper and a pinch of hot pepper flakes.  Then grill very hot for a short time, to get them charred up a bit while staying crunchy.  Done and done.

8454 2018-06-19 05:04:25 Price of crude also increased between 2004 and 2012. Now, tell me what happened to crude oil prices since 2012? There was a drastic drop to 30$ per barrel. How did the modi govt respond? By increasing the taxes to keep petrol prices at a constant rate which is just loot.

8483 2018-06-19 04:58:13 i love seeing people talk about the amazing benefits of a CBD oil. y’all know weed does the same thing right???
8484 2018-06-19 04:57:57 This oil smell like old people
8485 2018-06-19 04:57:46 WA is also pretty bad ass: "The state is the biggest producer of apples, hops, pears, red raspberries, spearmint oil, and sweet cherries, and ranks high in the production of apricots, asparagus, dry edible peas, grapes, lentils, peppermint oil, and potatoes"

Let's go.
8486 2018-06-19 04:57:27 Try rubbing peppermint or lavender oil on your temples! it's a god natural pain relief
8487 2018-06-19 04:56:53 I may try mixing in some peppermint and/or rosemary oil, but I suspect that may only tone it down a notch. My fear is that it will somehow feed the stench. I'm considering spraying it on a few plants, or around doorways.

8491 2018-06-19 04:55:46 Government shut down anyone?  Where should we start? The oil industry? Boycott gas stations for a weekend ?  There are really a lot of possibilities
8492 2018-06-19 04:55:36 i’ll never forget the time my dad hit some kids oil pen at a bar, got dumb high and drove home scared n af, somehow kicked off his shoes onto the driveway but fell asleep in his car and then later asked me if i knew about “dab oils”
8493 2018-06-19 04:55:35 Now, this is how we're been killed with cancer. Last night, you took 60% available poisoned alcohol, or food cooked with poisoned oil.  Now, you have just taken (sugar) tea - with mercury that causes cancer! Corruption kills! Rip Migori senator!
8494 2018-06-19 04:55:22 shea moisture the curling gel soufflé! It literally put soooo much moisture in my brittle blond hair (in addition to coconut oil).

8496 2018-06-19 04:54:32 Shoutout to the DIY gig for paying for my oil change tomorrow
8497 2018-06-19 04:54:23 Coconut oil is a scam. It literally does nothing. Only useful for removing makeup. The best oils for my hair have been jojoba, vitamin E, Carrot, peppermint, and the MOST AMAZING .... Black castor.
8498 2018-06-19 04:54:12 “Pfft! Ok, you big strong man you!” 

He opens the door for them, nose scrunching up a bit at the hot oil smell, but following him regardless. 

“Heh... you know I’m kidding about you paying for me. I can totally get my own stuff.”
8499 2018-06-19 04:54:07 Okay, I checked the pantry..I have a big bottle of Frank's either from the last time I made buffalo chicken mac n cheese or buffalo chicken potstickers, a little bottle of Tabasco, gochijang for many many things,  siracha for other people, & chili oil for noodles.
8500 2018-06-19 04:53:57 Gonna dose my brain in olive oil and fry it up for breakfast
8501 2018-06-19 04:53:49 Right? Lol.....my pleasure. 
Btw......coconut oil is an amazing & very cheap alternative. I’ve been using it lately (not on face tho) & tho it takes awhile to soak in...wow. #MyTip
8502 2018-06-19 04:53:44 Okay fine! I'll get my speedo and some baby oil.
8503 2018-06-19 04:53:42 Ya know if u put some bbq sauce over it & slow cook it in a crock pot or stock pot u can make a beautiful "pulled pork" style sandwich. I'd add a little oil, onion, s&p saute for a bit, then a tiny bit of water to get it soft & stringy. Then add bbq sauce.
8504 2018-06-19 04:53:33 unless they're gonna prescribe hash oil to treat it, don't even bother
8505 2018-06-19 04:53:21 Will it make it easy for the LCCs to poach traffic ?
Rising Oil & Sliding Rupee not a good combo
8506 2018-06-19 04:53:18 What are your thoughts on people who re-use the oil in their cooking pans? @HealthDomme
8507 2018-06-19 04:53:01 Neutrogena oil free with SPF is a good go to drugstore replacement.
8508 2018-06-19 04:52:22 OK so I had the bright purple stretch marks a while back, they are new stretch marks and while they are purple you can get rid of them if if use bio oil religiously - in the end they do go like normal stretch marks

8511 2018-06-19 04:52:11 i got vitamin e oil in my eye again nothing has broken me like this
8512 2018-06-19 04:52:05 You must be lacking essential vitamins to produce kerotine. Take some supplements, drink more juices, or Lather castor oil into your roots every night.
8513 2018-06-19 04:52:03 I hated the whole “coconut oil will save you thing” like it was good but like you gunna put this thick ass oil on your face??
8514 2018-06-19 04:51:42 I need a CBD oil connect 
8515 2018-06-19 04:51:39 Canada too, why they want to ship their fracked oil through US, instead of across Canada and spoil their natural resources.
And our Oligarchs jump at the chance to make money

8518 2018-06-19 04:51:26 @narendramodi Sir Pranam. 2019 election will be a tough one. Try to do some good things to Salaried middle class. Reducing the oil price will do some help. Control & Stop the antagonists BJP MPs & MLAs. Thanks.
8519 2018-06-19 04:51:23 My cousin dealt with doctors flat out ignoring actual issues on her bc she used to be much heavier, so I totally get that feeling. I hope the CBD oil works out for you like it has for me. Even if you just take it when you’re feeling down to help calm your nerves. 
8520 2018-06-19 04:51:07 It's the joke from Baseketball, "The Lakers moved to Los Angeles where there are no lakes. The Oilers moved to Memphis where there is no oil. And the Jazz moved to Utah where music is not allowed."

8528 2018-06-19 04:49:51 She's the defiant one and I'm the troll. Too funny.

This was a sumptuary law. One ancient Hebew COULD, in fact, wear blended fabrics; the High Priest. This was to keep the cloth holy. For similar reasons, holy oil used for anointing could not be used for cooking.
8529 2018-06-19 04:49:50 #ThisDay 1961 - Kuwait declared its independence from the United Kingdom after which the state's oil industry saw unprecedented economic growth. In 1990, Kuwait was invaded and annexed by neighbouring Iraq.

8552 2018-06-19 04:47:27 Yeah, I don't ever want to go to a doctor, they fat shame every time and I'm not brave enough to just tell them to stop telling me to lose weight. I'm scared they will get angry at me and I'll yell at them. The next time my mom goes out to shop, I'll ask for CBD Oil.
8553 2018-06-19 04:47:10 I love steamed, warmed slightly in a pan with olive oil, dried with baker's yeast and salt, and olive oil. It wiggles in between my teeth. Never fails. I bought Kale burgers. I have to try 'em out.
8554 2018-06-19 04:47:06 Nice! What flavor of snake oil did you use to rub on her eyes? 
Do you truly believe this deity picks and chooses who dies in car crashes?
8555 2018-06-19 04:46:59 @NicolasMaduro Mr President I can do for you USD for Oil and Gas. And currency exchange. I can do big deals.
8556 2018-06-19 04:46:50 Absolutely right now Oil Giants are destroying fresh water for fracking. Russia knows that is why the build up of NATO on their door. Since Russia has a lot of fresh water.
8557 2018-06-19 04:46:42 Go for it!  I mean 75% opposed the sale of govt assets under national, over 60% didnt want a flag referendum and the oil and gas ban is closer to 50/50 than both of those.  Im all for direct democracy though! So i'll vote for your referendum.
8558 2018-06-19 04:46:34 This is all bunglings how come so much overdues for Earlier period when oil is sold and money collected on spot.
8559 2018-06-19 04:46:31 SHARE:

"If you thought oil was discovered in Nigeria in 1959, you could pass your high school economics with that information. It was actually discovered 50 years earlier.

Did you know that Oil from the Territory was sold for almost 50 years before the approach of Independence

8561 2018-06-19 04:45:26 Check your Engine oil this afternoon.
8562 2018-06-19 04:44:49 A slight rise in crude oil price can be an excuse to raise the prices of petrol, diesel and LPG but a dip in the oil price is never a reason to lower the price of the same things.
8563 2018-06-19 04:44:28 A huge problem is refining capacity, not available oil.  The BO EPA passed laws that closed several older refineries & allowed few new ones to be built. Also, states like CA with different fuel laws increase the costs. In aviation, older planes need leaded fuels. Costs increase.

8565 2018-06-19 04:44:11 I think Mexico should immediately cut ALL shipments of oil to the US. Canada the same.

8567 2018-06-19 04:43:44 I guess Neem oil also repels insects. However it stinks so horribly I become more focused on trying to avoid myself, and no longer notice what bugs are doing. Spray your enemies with Neem oil.

8573 2018-06-19 04:42:28 Landscape fabric is evil. Don't do it. Unless you plan to flee the scene before you have to pull it up again. Garden tip: drench yourself in peppermint oil and the bugs will avoid you. Until you sweat off the peppermint oil. Get lots of peppermint oil. Plant peppermint. In pots.

Btw, higher USD is -ve for oil prices 

Noise on trade wars cloud growth outlook hence -ve for oil demand

Are oil prices headed lower?

8588 2018-06-19 04:39:31 If you have a problem, use coconut oil
8589 2018-06-19 04:38:46 yesss def let me know ! oh yeah I also put some coconut oil on my hair when I took out the bands bc ya know extra moisture 
8590 2018-06-19 04:38:34 In the trade war, at the moment the loser currency is the #Dollar which is reinforcing against all other currencies. So Us exports will cost more, but oil prices will higher because they are paid in Us dollars. The winner is $EURUSD which will be devaluating more in next weeks.
8591 2018-06-19 04:38:33 I've also been warned about the peanut oil. My boys haven't had an issue. Even so, I mostly order grilled chicken for my boys.
8592 2018-06-19 04:38:32 Tbh I bought Bio Oil because so many people who also have bad scarring highly recommend it, and I put it on before I go to sleep but I always toss and turn or I forget to put it on but I have noticed it helps and it’s kinda cheap (you don’t need to use much since it’s oil)
8593 2018-06-19 04:38:13 Soaked myself in coconut oil this evening and I feel so refreshed
8594 2018-06-19 04:38:12 I love a fine scrub to exfoliate and a nice charcoal/mud mask. And I use rose oil which feels luxurious and smells great.

8598 2018-06-19 04:37:29 I don't buy lotion .. like Jergens and all that stuff. For a while now I've been using shea butter. Almost a year + ago I started mixing my shea butter with essential oils (vitamin E oil, black castor oil, peppermint oil, lavender oil etc.) my skin is just flourishing.
8599 2018-06-19 04:37:28 is you haven’t tried blending some avacado, oil, and balsamic vinager for a salad dressing you missin out
8600 2018-06-19 04:37:23 No overseas war since WWII has made us safer, it could be argued that recent wars have made us less safe. Sure, you go after those who attack you, but you don't decide for other countries what is best for them. We don't need Middle East oil, we have hundreds of years of reserves
8601 2018-06-19 04:37:15 What about the Vancouver gas price??
When a barrel of oil was $20 we were paying $1.30 now oil is $60 and we r paying up to $1.60 a liter????
8602 2018-06-19 04:37:12 Pride builds a wall between people.Humility builds bridges.Humility is the oil that smoothes and smoothes relationship.Humble people are focused on serving others,they don't think of themselves only.

8607 2018-06-19 04:36:27 Cream has a higher oil or moisturizing content. A good thing imo 
8608 2018-06-19 04:35:55 Nearly sold oil and bought milk!

8613 2018-06-19 04:35:18 @arunjaitley Respected Sir, you've said that people should pay taxes honestly so that govt have not to depend on extra oil taxes and we've also seen strong steps taken by govt. But wht abt Political Corruption? have u taken any strong steps? Don't u think its a matter of concern.
8614 2018-06-19 04:35:11 If you're not a #corporation, or the #military, or #oil, you matter very little to a majority of the government in this country #USA
8615 2018-06-19 04:34:53 Tesla, Space-X sabotaged? Hardly surprising given the money the oil and auto companies have, and the aerospace industry.  The propaganda campaign has been extensive, and the money tied up shorting Musk must be a record amount.  #Ihatethe21stcentury
8616 2018-06-19 04:34:48 Nope. Because ice cream isn’t made of hot fudge. Putting butter on something made of roughly three gallons of oil is crazy.

8625 2018-06-19 04:32:51 I agree with cutting back on overseas wars to an extent. But we don't know everything. There is classified info that many of us arent privy to. Sometimes overseas wars make us safer. Should we not have gone after Osama? Do we allow a regime like Iran to control middle east (oil)?

8629 2018-06-19 04:32:19 Your president praised a dictator who performes forced abortions on the women of his country by having soldiers step on their abdomen and by injecting motor oil in their uterus. He fed newborns to dogs, yet Trump said “we understand each other”. Where was your outrage then?

8665 2018-06-19 04:24:55 Nice. They've managed to relabel liberals as the ruling class, even though the ruling class is primarily wealthy Republicans. And while I'm at it, Deep State? If there is one, it's along the lines of Cheney, Rumsfeld, oil, weapons, CIA, Bush, Sr., and the power behind the GOP.

and China does care about the CNY price of oil -- and maybe a few other commodities. 

but not in my experience about the price of imported manufactures (which are a very small share of Chinese consumption)

8699 2018-06-19 04:17:10 Hyaluronic acid and a cream that contains peptides and ceramides did the trick for my old-age induced dry skin (technically, my skin is dehydrated because there's no lack of oil but it's still flaky, so it needs water. Or so the theory goes).
8700 2018-06-19 04:16:44 And they landed in the only chunk of land in the Middle East that doesn’t have oil. Yeah. It’s a huge conspiracy to steal a worthless tract of land.

8712 2018-06-19 04:15:14 The US can move all military bases from Texas.  The US can stop all funding of research in Texas.  The US can stop all shipment of crude oil into Texas. The US can stop all trade from other states with Texas.  So you see, you need us more than we need you. We will blockade!

8748 2018-06-19 04:07:51 Trumps uncle has ties to Tesla. There is technology that has been kept repressed to depend us on oil, Edison etc. He plans to release the technology and is preparing US to take the lead in development. It's a good thing.

8755 2018-06-19 04:06:07 They do not hide this - it’s well known. Our allergist says commercially processed peanut oil does not contain the allergen - and my son has been fine for years at CFA. Might not be the same for everyone, of course, though.

8759 2018-06-19 04:05:44 Yeah. I was amazed. I did a 250mg capsule of CBD oil and had a massage...other than the guy really grinding in during the massage and me feeling bruised for a day, I felt back to normal. I've never had a massage be that effective for my pain. Andddddd....
8760 2018-06-19 04:05:23 Advice: don’t put a tea tree oil face mask on a sunburnt face. It hurts.
8761 2018-06-19 04:05:02 Can 100% see Chi moving back to 15 for a first next year. & I could 100% see moving up to grab a Bokk or Kupari from our 2nd rounder.

The Oil giving up their 10th for Psysk and Petro is a little far fetched. But their GM is insane and they’re desperate. So I won’t rule it out.
8762 2018-06-19 04:05:01 & maybe not even just oil but an entire change.

8775 2018-06-19 04:02:40 SAME, tho only oily in Tzone and only dry on cheeks. Facial oil plus some intense moisturizer & adding hyaluronic acid fixed it. It felt so WEIRD to voluntarily put oil on my face, but whaddya know

8798 2018-06-19 03:59:20 Wholly misleading and some lies here. The tax now includes several small daily use items that were not taxed earlier. This has hurt poor the most. Another deliberate and wiful omission has been oil and liquor that would have reduced prices substantially.

8825 2018-06-19 03:54:18 Yo diría que cambiar urgente los contratos de energía, pesificar los costos, a la empresa que no le sirva que devuelva la concesión. Pesificar al menos naftas y gas oil y acelerar el proceso de recambio de autos eléctricos. Subsidiar tipo de cambio a importaciones productivas

8895 2018-06-19 03:43:32 I have been trying CBD oil capsules for pain management (pinched nerve/back pain) and side effect is I no longer wake up having anxiety attacks so I don't get lost in my head with everything that I need to get done.

8897 2018-06-19 03:43:07 LOL every time you put a "nutritionist" in charge of your diet you will wind up "malnourished." Those kids were on white toast, mayonnaise, corn oil, and bacon. My daughter was there, I know.

8901 2018-06-19 03:42:35 These industries don’t last.  This is not a surprise.  Look at all the ghost towns across North America.  It’s better if they leave prematurely, less of a mess. People left will go back to school or do some other pointless job. People do oil work because it’s there.

8915 2018-06-19 03:40:28 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
8916 2018-06-19 03:40:28 And coconut oil for baby it’s a organic brand and what a difference also are you going to have ur baby sleep with the stuff animals you should remove them until he is a little older just to be safe
8917 2018-06-19 03:40:28 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

And who will reclaim or revive it?  Texaco, Apache, Shell?  These are just mining camps to them and people are just a cheap resource
8922 2018-06-19 03:39:42 .. "zero-sum gain" is Canadian Econo-Speak for "doesn't improve my US dollar Academic pension chances".. based on the assumption that we'd 𝘯𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳 refine the oil or saw the wood to sell to China and Europe.. so time has come to find new customers #KidsArentLeverage #ScrewNAFTA

8924 2018-06-19 03:38:47 Oil fields in TX. Just got offered a position for a company. They average 2,500 to 3,000 a week. I got a lot of thinking and praying to do. It would be hard work, but that money could also change my life.
8925 2018-06-19 03:38:46 Me and my little baby saw ur video I love it, my baby is 2 months 2 things I would recommend use the dove soap for baby and lotion I used baby Johnson including the baby oil and oh girl my daughter had a terrible allergic reaction so now I use dove lotion

8949 2018-06-19 03:34:36 Fair enough, but what is normal? what about the large increase is shale production?  It takes about 11-12 weeks to get oil from SA to the US, long enough to drill and produce some oil from shale.

8959 2018-06-19 03:31:52 I don't, but I do have grapeseed oil. Is it just the tiniest of drops that you mix in?
8960 2018-06-19 03:31:52 So they asked Him, saying, “Teacher, but when will these things be? And what sign will there be when these things are about to take place?”

Luke 21:7-8
Deception.  Jesus warns us.
It is increasing rapidly.  Check your lamp oil.

8964 2018-06-19 03:31:01 i keep hearing good things about coconut oil on tattoos so i’m trying it
wish me luck ?
8965 2018-06-19 03:30:58 They’re really good. And just simple organic unrefined coconut oil and leave it on for 45 min to an hour. It works miracles!! No problem!(: inwent through the hair journey it takes time but its worth it.
8966 2018-06-19 03:30:54 @Cinthia_Vazquez qué tal de adolorida un día después de tu primer medio maratón ?
8967 2018-06-19 03:30:50 Some of the creamier ones don't work well with a beauty blender (oil+water). 
Also-- not a silly question! It's very valid :)
8968 2018-06-19 03:30:42 Or your hands might be too clean. Try touching your face (say the side of your nose), then try again. Not being shady but they need a certain amount of body oil to work.

8971 2018-06-19 03:29:53 India and China which together account for almost 17% of oil consumption are working on forming a coalition of sorts to get better bargains from oil exporting nations. In my opinion China is a more crucial partner to India in the future than the US in many ways.
8972 2018-06-19 03:29:53 No uncertainty in Alberta though.  Notley is a lame duck despite genuflecting to big oil.  

Later she'll wish she saved some integrity.
8973 2018-06-19 03:29:35 I noticed the lack of freckles and wondered how you felt about it. I also noticed the peach fuzz butt that's just like I would have seen someone's nose, that remotely remarkable to me. Do you have a facial oil? I use basic grapeseed for this.

8975 2018-06-19 03:29:09 I don't get it. Is she saying Rihanna copied her #BodyLava from HER?  I think this was already outted on a gossip site and she got lit up for it. Rihanna's formula and her oil based formula are VERY different. And other, far more established and exclusive brands, make it too.

8980 2018-06-19 03:28:24 How my closing shift went tonight:

So yeah, today was great

8983 2018-06-19 03:28:02 Banking sanctions. They did not have access to the international banking system due to Sanction put in place by the US and its allies. To this day there are Sanction imposed on them. They have been reduced not removed. The Nuke Deal, that we violated, allowed them to sell oil.

8985 2018-06-19 03:28:01 Maybe there's an essential oil or cream or something you could use once it heals to keep it from scarring? Usually keeping things moisturized helps keep them from scarring.

8994 2018-06-19 03:25:38 Coconut oil is comodogenic so it can clog your pores. I prefer cleansing balms persobally because they are just easier to use.

9012 2018-06-19 03:23:48 That’s half true, but we were also taken off the gold standard and put on a fiat currency backed by oil.

9034 2018-06-19 03:20:28 Yes, support the US oil and gas industry.  We are now exporting freedom around the world, disrupting OPEC and neutering the power of those countries and the terrorists that don’t share our values. No industry does as much to create high paying jobs and enhance national security.
9035 2018-06-19 03:20:27 the other night i sprayed travel sized hairspray into my mouth instead of my CBD oil 
9036 2018-06-19 03:20:04 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
9037 2018-06-19 03:20:04 literal que salió oil of every pearl's un-insides de @SOPHIEMSMSMSM y dejé de escuchar 20 mil veces repetidamente so sad so sexy
9038 2018-06-19 03:20:02 "Oh.. you are the best.." She purrs, breathing in a deep inhale of the scented oil blending perfectly with Will's musk. Her eyes close, fingers spreading into the soft bedding beneath her. She's more than happy to be taken care of by the man she loves.

9041 2018-06-19 03:19:27 If you wear makeup the best thing you can do is actually introduce a double cleanse into your routine. Use a cleansing oil or balm to remove your makeup and then follow with a mild cleanser
9042 2018-06-19 03:19:27 I agree with you. UCP should issue a policy. I also think the NDP should come up with a plan to manage AB economy. Burying their head into the sand and hoping  oil recovers isn't a plan.

9048 2018-06-19 03:18:33 Trump’s not cleaning the swamp he’s filling it, he’s essentially a snake oil salesman
9049 2018-06-19 03:18:32 "The oil and gas industry, which has normally cheered the administration’s efforts to expand drilling, has joined forces with the wind and solar industries to oppose Trump’s grid proposal, calling it 'unprecedented and misguided'"

9051 2018-06-19 03:18:23 Crude oil falls w Rm dropping we pay more.
9052 2018-06-19 03:18:21 Again not true.... Oil & Gas and petrochemicals contribute more than 85% of both turnover and profit for Ril so it is not a diversified player but at best an O&G company with other interests.... The same is true for ONGC as well so the comparison is quite fair
9053 2018-06-19 03:18:12 What did I say? I said India buys oil from any country which it chooses! What is wrong in that?

9056 2018-06-19 03:17:45 “Good,” he murmurs, tender as his touch. Hands only leave her flesh long enough to pull up her shirt to the shoulders and then fetch a bedside bottle of fragrant oil. A few drops are warmed in between palms before he begins to massage again.  “Now relax. Let me take care of you.”
9057 2018-06-19 03:17:43 Just slap some oil in this bitch with a good quick detangle and you’re good to go

9059 2018-06-19 03:17:02 A) How much of this is reporting bias? Easier to document these groups now?
B) I’d put easy access to weapons high on list of hypotheses—not just AKs, but oil, fertilizer, stuff from collapsing armies, etc

9066 2018-06-19 03:15:52 Hi @chigrl for someone just starting out learning the oil markets, is there any books you would recommend or is there online resources that you would start at?
9067 2018-06-19 03:15:50 Made myself a upcycled coffee grounds and sugar scrub this weekend. Just used it and not sure if my skin feels softer due to the exfoliating, the coconut oil or placebo, but my shower and now I smell of coffee. So there’s that.

9116 2018-06-19 03:06:21 Trump stopped missiles from flying from Korea.  He opened up off shore oil drilling.  He opened up clean coal for Kentucky and West Virginia.  The Wall Street Journal stated this tremendous economy is all because of TRUMP.

9119 2018-06-19 03:05:53 Pro tip: CBD oil on a sunburn
9120 2018-06-19 03:05:39 Yeah, hard water is a B. I’d invest in a couple products like a good moisturizing after conditioner or oil. When I do have to brush it, I use a spray so I can get the 4 day old knots out 
9121 2018-06-19 03:05:19 Get some blood and dilute with water. We bought a product that they supposedly use in the north on the border of fields it is bovine blood and mineral oil. Kept the deer away from our apple trees
9122 2018-06-19 03:04:58 I’m Italian, that could be useful. Olive oil is expensive af
9123 2018-06-19 03:04:58 I'm not familiar with Yamaha at all. I have a 2015 Merc and have had one minor issue with the oil reservoir. I stripped the cap on it. Hondas  I agree are quiet and perform well from what little I know of them. I am very interested in the new v8 from Mercury depending on price
9124 2018-06-19 03:04:27 You know, in Canada marijuana is considered a commodity. I once listened to an entire news segment about pot trading on BNN before filming a segment on oil. Could be just what the commodities markets here need...

9139 2018-06-19 03:02:48 It goes to show what world he lives in. He has yet to answer to his constituents or even defend the party he represents. Nothing short of a carpetbagger or a snake oil salesmen. Which is an insult to both at the moment.

9141 2018-06-19 03:02:37 I use witch hazel as a toner, and I use rosehip oil at night before bed. I don’t like to use it during the day because my skin absorbs it better at night, so basically I’m looking for something not too heavy if that makes sense

9158 2018-06-19 03:00:23 It’s true. I have always defended Chris for having her on to get all sides, but there is literally no point when she’s incapable of truth. She is a snake oil saleswoman who is disingenuous and truly believes in alternative facts. Can’t stand her, she’s appalling.

9166 2018-06-19 02:58:55 Tea tree oil is really good too if you can't get any clove oil. But for real, clove is where it's at.

2. Large fii outflows of 6800 crs in last 6 days

4. Trade war fears again will keep mkts on edge

He never (and never intended to) backed up ideals with action. He actually undermined them every way he could
9226 2018-06-19 02:48:29 #Crude, last night price did went down to around $63. But price went up. What's next? There'll be a spike w/ price between  $67-68. I'll let you know when this spike is over.

9309 2018-06-19 02:39:14 Yes.  You're clearly f***ing insane.  If you want high-sulfur tar sands bitumen going out to there rest of the world, letting our oil prices rise, fine.  As usual, you claim great benefit for this country when mainly the corporation and other countries benefit from it.

9352 2018-06-19 02:31:15 Really? The biggest driver of “green technology” is the oil patch. A carbon tax on consumers, in Canada, is a joke; given the size of our country. The PM would do well to gain citizenship in France or Cuba.

Secondly, how would you legalise cannabis to smoke now it's basically impossible to buy and smoke fags?

9390 2018-06-19 02:27:01 Money can be worth different amounts. For instance if we subsidized the property tax of grocery stores instead of churches, in exchange for them lowering the price on goods they sell, our money would be worth more at grocery stores. Like we already subsidize oil for cheap gas.
9391 2018-06-19 02:26:59 Maybe we can ship our oil to international markets instead!!!

LOL!

9598 2018-06-19 01:55:59 Hi @gaia, that's right, we're still involved in the oil business for the time being, but we're not invested in exploring oil reserves. We're instead looking to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and finding alternative ways to help move people from one place to another. ^MZ

9603 2018-06-19 01:54:56 I guess, but give me Midnight Oil over Toto any day.
9604 2018-06-19 01:54:45 Um....a little Panko, a lot of parm, garlic power, red pepper flake, salt, pepper (I put the last two into the egg for dredging).  Shallow fried in olive oil.  I was going to bake them, but ended up not.  I think I’ll let the breading settle first next time!
9605 2018-06-19 01:54:35 y'all i got the best pieces of cardboard from work they're such cool shapes and they're huge and i wanna use them for oil pastels but inevitably i'll never get around to doing that BUT they have cat images on one side of them so i can just put them on my wall or something yfhfj
9606 2018-06-19 01:54:35 @rosycheeked_ I tried that shave oil stuff we got and YOURE RIGHT it’s good
9607 2018-06-19 01:54:04 We only buy it when it's on sale or clearance. And we've only tried the chops. We marinate them in olive oil, rosemary, and thyme and grill them in medium heat for 3 minutes on each side. I like them medium rare. These were delicious!
9608 2018-06-19 01:53:51 did @jimcramer say immigration? I only remember him saying high oil prices.
9609 2018-06-19 01:53:42 @tedcruz  has a fix. Detain them as families, speedy hearings within two weeks and swift deportations for the 80%  + that dont qualify.
Seems fair.
9610 2018-06-19 01:53:37 That oil field life
9611 2018-06-19 01:53:36 If memory serves, a lot of alternative energy patents were bought up by oil companies during the 1970s to keep them off the market until the oil ran out. But though it would make good business sense, it’s probably a conspiracy theory.
9612 2018-06-19 01:53:34 He says maybe it’s the oil industry. Really? Exxon is worried that Tesla’s going to spell the end of big oil? I’d need a lot of evidence to believe that.

9618 2018-06-19 01:52:55 they cannot possibly be equivalent.

We can pan sear a steak and swap out oil for the butter and get close to a bistecca a la toscana. But nothing melts like cheese or crusts like lard (I'm told).

9627 2018-06-19 01:51:47 I can’t stress enough how much CBD oil has helped me with my negative thoughts towards getting things done, and my own art. It’s definitey not a medication replacement, but it has been a very good mood stabilizer and even my family has noticed the changes.
9628 2018-06-19 01:51:37 Diversification is not simply getting out of the oil and gas sector as many would suggest. It is some new and different areas to develop but also how so we enhance and get ROI from the energy sector. To propel ourselves and world forward. #55North2018
9629 2018-06-19 01:51:34 definitely try the willow facial mist and the balancing facial oil for acne! they both have tea tree oil which helps stops it. for hyperpigmentation, the oil can also help with renewing the skin.
9630 2018-06-19 01:51:34 same shit everywhere! here in scotland the have the black sea oilfields but tehyre all sold to other companies and we get out nat. gas from russia! and have to buy oil from opec and the like-gas prices at the pump-here appx $11-12 a gallon!
9631 2018-06-19 01:51:15 I took my car to get a oil change today after work and brought my dumb ass right in the house to shower and watch tv . No streets for me today 
9632 2018-06-19 01:51:12 I just moisturized my whole body head to toe in coconut oil. Are my mental illnesses gone yet, Tumblr?
9633 2018-06-19 01:51:07 Yeah...too much coconut oil will impair a lot of things
9634 2018-06-19 01:51:03 They are complicit (ask Ivanka) and are terrified to be caught in the pocket of Russian money, big oil money, big pharma money.  They do NOT care about their constituents, only about keeping their positions.  Get rid of all GOP. #Resistance #BlueWave2018
9635 2018-06-19 01:50:58 Mine has totally rusted a little before (because I am bad) and a little steel wool to scrub it out, a quick wash, heated to dry, oil to season, good as new.
9636 2018-06-19 01:50:51 That’s why I don’t let my wife get oil changes cause they always wanna take advantage of someone
9637 2018-06-19 01:50:51 there’s an ad that keeps showing up about dollops of avocado oil mayonnaise on their sushi roll and i’m. disgusted
9638 2018-06-19 01:50:51 The 200 Alberta business leaders in the room generally agree we’re in a whole new world.  It ain’t about just the price of oil.  #55North2018 @55northca
9639 2018-06-19 01:50:45 I'd like to have a tiny piece of the change they gonna save.  I read that if one of our Aircraft Carriers used oil instead of nuking along, it'd get about 6 inches to the galleon. And smoke like a VW on the emission test stand. Then figure the rest of  the ships, planes etc.
9640 2018-06-19 01:50:41 I wonderrrrr if CBD oil wil heal my stomach LOL. Imma google this omg
9641 2018-06-19 01:50:33 somehow, every single pair of pants I own ends up with a single, tiny oil stain, and my mental issues make it impossible to wear them

9658 2018-06-19 01:47:23 ONGC is an oil producing company, where crude prices during each FY determines PAT. RIL is gets money from refining. Crude prices are more volatile than refining margins. The comparison is irrational and sinister. Secondly ONGC is plagued by inefficiencies like any other PSU.
9659 2018-06-19 01:47:07 Payments of oil bonds were outstanding was known. Oil marketing companies were in doldrums, economy was in mess with sky high inflation but the consumer was happy & reckless with subsidized fuel. This govts failure is in not keeping public in loop.

9685 2018-06-19 01:43:46 Between the first few uses.  After that the oil is polymerized to such a degree than seasoning like that is really unnecessary.  My better seasoned pans I just heat up after washing to bake the water out then put away

9739 2018-06-19 01:35:28 Because I’m young I’m uninformed? Seems to me like democrats have been working on climate change for a long time with no results. Very likely because oil industry money is involved.
9740 2018-06-19 01:35:06 How about naming the wealthy tycoons with interests in the Baiken Oil Sands, who are funding the protests of the natives and environmentalists against the pipelines in BC.

9753 2018-06-19 01:31:31 I understand the desire to do so. But to invest in new tech to truly make coal clean is redundant. Oil and gas will run out in 50 years or so, and coal would in another 50. Why diminish these resources when their tech to stay clean will cost the same/more than solar in some cases

9870 2018-06-19 01:13:54 I heard that garbage all through out the 1980s & 1990s. Places like Venezuela have screwed themselves into the ground in spite of oil wealth, yet they still blame the US for their problems. They are not alone in countries in Central & SA being their own worst enemies.
9871 2018-06-19 01:13:51 If you can get your hands on either albutetol from a pal with asthma and ibuprofen,  that's the next best with lemon juice and coconut oil. Flovent .... that is a wonder inhaler for that... that stuff fixed me up in 3 or 4 days.

9873 2018-06-19 01:13:29 So I take vitamins (like a good adult) and I usually take the gummy vitamins first and then the pills. My dumb ass brain confused the two and immediately started chewing the fish oil capsules and I’ve never felt like more of an idiot in my life
9874 2018-06-19 01:13:26 your recalls my skin tag to be its olive oil later than a Google Poi through her chunky heartbeat
9875 2018-06-19 01:13:24 I feel like I need a sip of Frankie's CBD oil before I go in there. It always feels so awkward maneuvering around. Why is the layout so crooked and confusing?
9876 2018-06-19 01:13:24 I was telling my mom she should use CBD oil and my gma gonna pull out her wax pen and say hit this lmaoo
9877 2018-06-19 01:12:41 Just a reminder:
No tax returns shown.
Puerto Rico struggling.
Flint has filthy water.
The President is under investigation.
The environment is being raped.
Native Americans are exploited for oil.
Children are ripped from their parents.
Nazis are encouraged.
All TRUMP.

9881 2018-06-19 01:12:09 Now I see. You are calculating correctly, but not calculating what the text is reporting. ;-) The text talks about the increase in olive oil and nuts, not compared to the control group.
9882 2018-06-19 01:11:56 Is that what you use when you inject your body with “oil”

9886 2018-06-19 01:11:28 Being a healthy gamer is something to look forward too! Most of those look like vitamins, I’m sure I spot some fish oil down there if I’m not mistaken

9924 2018-06-19 01:07:00 Canada, in turn, sold wood and beaver to the French for steel. Rope, salt and cannon fodder to the English for guns and powder. Now we pimp oil, wood and electricity for tractors and tang to the Americans.. It's time to move out our parent's basement and build our own things now.
9925 2018-06-19 01:06:46 The oil and gas industry, which has normally cheered the administration’s efforts to expand drilling, has joined forces with the wind and solar industries to oppose Mr. Trump’s grid proposal, calling it “unprecedented and misguided.”

9964 2018-06-19 01:00:56 And it's fleeting wealth. There's a reason the prince is shaking up the country that drastically. He intended to end their dependence on oil in 4 years. And he's been making good progress on that end.
