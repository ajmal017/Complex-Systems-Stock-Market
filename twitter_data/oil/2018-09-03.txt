1 2018-09-03 23:59:43 Saddam was a damn fool who tried to manage a terror cartel in Iraq and was taken out. In Libya, Europe tried to take back the oil fields because the EU needs oil and miscalculated. In Syria, a tinpot despot tried to cow the majority with death squads and secret police and failed.
2 2018-09-03 23:59:30 When boiling water and it starts foaming over, pour in some olive oil. Just a bit. It'll make the overflowing go away.
3 2018-09-03 23:59:20 Yes we know about the pipeline that involves Syria....it’s always about oil for war
4 2018-09-03 23:59:19 If you care so much about Canadian jobs, explain your opposition to Energy East.  Canadian Oil in Canadian refineries vs Saudi oil creating Saudi jobs!  Energy East would also make refineries in Quebec viable and help them re-open. educate yourself!
5 2018-09-03 23:59:17 My mom found a “book" about dinosaurs by my sis in second grade.  An excerpt: "We are thankful for dinosaurs in many ways. First they gave us oil."  Ha!
6 2018-09-03 23:58:36 CBD oil is extremely helpful if you haven’t tried it you need to give it a shot 
7 2018-09-03 23:58:18 @HarvestTrader any news on crush was it released today hearing oil builds but that’s from a $699 bear financing long puts with short calls
8 2018-09-03 23:58:17 Ummm....

Trump has effectively depressed the pri Ed of oil by enabling proud tion and exploration.

You basically got it 100% wrong.
9 2018-09-03 23:58:09 We have a free provincially paid for men's health support group program. See if there is one in your area. As well, CBD oil has worked amazing for me, non addictive and covered by our province. It manages panic attacks and fear of things like public transit ect.

12 2018-09-03 23:57:31  get some growth oil
13 2018-09-03 23:56:51 I don’t do anything fancy  I use neutropenia pink grapefruit stuff just to cleanse my skin of oil & then I follow up with the cerave moisturizer so it’s not so stripped and that’s it! I must disclose however I took accutane a few years ago so I’m not as prone to breakouts as
14 2018-09-03 23:56:49 I remember when I was about 10 & I had a cat and one time I gave her a bath and put baby oil all over her. That lil pussy was sliding all around the house

17 2018-09-03 23:56:30 The fact is Alberta had enough resources that all Albertans should of been oil sheikh rich if receiving our "fair share"  44 years of Con rule left us with nothing to show for it all. They couldnt be bothered to even build a proper hwy to fort mac or to get oil to world markets

40 2018-09-03 23:55:47 DT hypocrisy. Syria is a soverign nation. Leave them alone to take care of cleaning up their nation from terrorists the USA/CIA/McCain is funding to protect the oil fields the pentagon is stealing from. You said that America is not so innocent.  #FalseCWFlag from ALQ immiment.
41 2018-09-03 23:55:35 Israel is simply an outpost for the US to station nuclear weapons for when the middle east stands up for itself. Amazing how Israel itself has no oil, gas or other resource. Why do you think they want to expand and take areas such as the Golan? Or Gaza? Or Iran?

50 2018-09-03 23:54:22 If you don't have to add oil, it's likely not burning it. If the carb is adjustable it may be running a little lean, dark smoke indicates rich. I'd watch the oil level closely to help diagnose.

67 2018-09-03 23:51:20 Find anyone who isn’t a Democrat & therefore a sworn enemy of George Bush who says it’s about oil. If you can find the FBI, DOJ or any neutral government organization that would work too. But you can’t. Because we didn’t steal anything. That’s why gas prices went UP not down.
68 2018-09-03 23:51:18 Good for you.  The world works on the strength of batteries.  NOT. #oil #natgas.  #treehuggersloose
69 2018-09-03 23:50:58 Oh, not because our oil makes "the cleanest, most ethical, environmentally-friendly energy in the world"?
70 2018-09-03 23:50:33 So... My car should be fine. We think the problem is that the oil cap or the gasket is cracked or loose. It's an easy fix. But tomorrow my new tablet comes in and I'm drawing SO MUCH Y'ALL
71 2018-09-03 23:50:17 Venezuela is a petrostate in a global economy with weak demand for oil. Nationalizing one industry doesn't make a country socialist, unless you believe every country with firefighters and soldiers is socialist 
72 2018-09-03 23:50:15 Its an infection caused by a build up of dirt and bacteria in our pores, the excess sebum and oil causes swelling and pus is caused by dead white blood cells swarming to the area to try and break down the invading dirt/bacteria

75 2018-09-03 23:49:58 I think this he is doing this to affect supply & demand and expose our strategic metal and oil producing limits to maybe Russia and China. Knowing your enemies limits is necessary to successfully wage war and have an upper hand.
76 2018-09-03 23:49:56 Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Natural Aloe Vera is good for your scalp. Stay away from products with parabens. Is it NISIM or NHB? A shampoo to controls hair loss. or analogous. How on earth do I unearth the legitimate web address. So versatile. Worth the time.

82 2018-09-03 23:49:16 Alternative energies CAN be our major energy source - the rest is just rescuing big coal, oil.  We need to mobilise again before our country is dug up and polluted like the Houston USA that is Morrison’s example of cheap energy.

86 2018-09-03 23:48:56 I’ve used 100% CBD oil and it helped with my Trigeminal neuralgia (eye pain and headaches) and it helped my anxiety. I would definitely recommend it!

88 2018-09-03 23:48:09 So we cut off oil, lumber, beef, hydro, water, and tech from going to US and you can buy all that from where? China? Russia? 
89 2018-09-03 23:47:46 Things are finally settling down... *sigh* time for rest... I lost more semen than BP lost oil in our beautiful oceans.
90 2018-09-03 23:47:46 Oil on my hands up to my elbows.

96 2018-09-03 23:46:41 Aesthetics wise I love Titan as a concept, but the whole oil rig deal leads to more 'accidents' then I'd care to admit
97 2018-09-03 23:46:28 I work with someone that uses cannabis and CBD oil. He said it helps.

100 2018-09-03 23:46:14 A variety of ways.  Most convenient: Either capsules or as an oil placed under tongue with dropper.
101 2018-09-03 23:46:04 At least they do relatively productive things with their oil money
102 2018-09-03 23:45:23 I mean, I still remember a part in one of those Remember Me books where the main character was about to bang some dude after a ~sensual massage~ and there was “hot, sweaty oil” involved 
103 2018-09-03 23:45:22 I filled Lao's Skell with oil
104 2018-09-03 23:45:16 Who the hell ARE these people??? - "crank, charlatan and snake oil merchant" - I don't know or follow anybody matching these descriptors. 
I suspect you paint with a pretty broad and biased brush.
105 2018-09-03 23:45:04 The US w/ its own oil reserves alone will soon be the largest oil producer in the world. Trump is only doing what he promised his voters to do; force the elimination of trade barriers & stop unfair trade against the US. Canada will comply witth this demand or suffer consequences.
106 2018-09-03 23:44:43 #OIL
107 2018-09-03 23:44:38 That I know. Chavez settled all his loans with WB and IMF because both institutions were pushing the imperialist agenda in the affairs of Venezuelan oil. That's where sabotage started because capital wants those they capture to remain in their captive forever
108 2018-09-03 23:44:29 Lab analysis reveals sharjeel memon bottles contained olive oil and honey. Now this kangaroo judge must smoke some hashish and resign from the public office.
109 2018-09-03 23:44:25 structure both State & Central Govt revenue goes up with increase in crude oil prices & rupee depreciation.This concept is to be debated with Experts with data which ur research team can provide. @dpradhanbjp @PetroleumMin @_anujsinghal @AnilSinghviZEE @latha_venkatesh
110 2018-09-03 23:44:08 The proven oil reserves in Venezuela are recognized as the largest in the world, totaling 297 billion barrels as of 1 January 2014. 
So, as usual U.S.A. must control that oil or else !!!!
111 2018-09-03 23:43:58 @Dominos_AU tip for customers, revive #pizza seconds by cooking it in a frying pan with a bit of oil. Works best with #pan pizza 
112 2018-09-03 23:43:56 I thought the main US buyer of Venezuelan oil was CITGO.
113 2018-09-03 23:43:55 The next time some fool thinks a job is "shameful", I suggest they take their trash to the dump, wash their own dishes when out, cut their own grass, pick up their own dog poop, bag their own groceries, drain their own car oil, flip their own fries, etc, etc, etc.
114 2018-09-03 23:43:20 Just saw your post on Sky news, don’t give up angel, we read so many times of people making miracle recoveries, 3 I’ve read this year from using cannabis oil when told only days/weeks to live...praying for a miracle for you x God Bless xx
115 2018-09-03 23:43:19 It's also based on a complete misunderstanding of oil processing... other heavy, sour (sulphur-rich) oils like Mexico's Maya play sell for very similar prices, even on international markets. The "discount" is a *processing cost* discount relative to light and intermediate crudes.
116 2018-09-03 23:43:16 i gotta start back using that wild growth oil, that stuff had my hair growing like hell.

118 2018-09-03 23:43:14 @EnergzdEconomy Do you believe the petro-yuan might play a relevant role on the oil markes in the forseable future? if so, what would be the implications?
119 2018-09-03 23:43:12 Remember we are UN allies and if you turned on us the 78 other countries by LAW would have to join us in going against you.  Russia I think would join us too as between us we have 68% of worlds oil supply.  Saudi Arabia is running out in 23 years!

122 2018-09-03 23:42:37 Try CBD oil.  I promise, you'll notice a difference.
123 2018-09-03 23:42:32 What’s happening in Venezuela ? With all that oil there shouldn’t be any food shortages and all the other problems. 
Well, it’s all about the oil !!!

125 2018-09-03 23:42:19 That would be admitting that the bitumen sands have no future. The smarter people in cabinet may already think so, but no government wants to be in charge when the fatal contradictions of oil sands development start melting down corporate valuations

127 2018-09-03 23:42:08 Iran Sanctions have launched oil above $70/barrel. USA produced a record 11 million barrels /day. Russia produced 11.7 million barrels/day.

129 2018-09-03 23:41:47 Right, I think it supports my position better. Saturated fat is good for us.  Some plant oils, including corn and sunflower oil, have little omega 3 content. If these are the primary oils consumed and intake of omega 3 fatty acids from fish and other sources is low, this could...
130 2018-09-03 23:41:36 Jeanne Louis Calment was the world's longest living person. She died at 122 years 164 days old and the majority of her diet was wine, olive oil, and dark chocolate. Wow.
131 2018-09-03 23:41:16 Nonone has enough supply to cover our supply, your stratergic supply by law is only for military use and is good for 20 days.  Look it up, we have all the Uranuim, the most oil, the most fertilizer, and more lumber than you.
132 2018-09-03 23:40:58 If only !   I tried cbd oil but it did nothing for me
133 2018-09-03 23:40:44 Sweeeet! I want to see this awesome loot! I got lucky with the oil slick dice, it was the last set they had. Whew!

I might’ve picked up some bday gifts for a bday game too

Sarajevo, the site of the 1984 Winter Olympics (and where WWI began), was reduced to rubble. But the former Yugoslavia didn't have oil.
139 2018-09-03 23:40:11 Michael Who EVER you are . IF you are NOT from TEXAS , Keep your Riot Inciting ASS Out of My State . WE DO NOT Suffer FOOLS who come to TEXAS who don’t know their ass from an oil well Derrick. We might have to DRILL Down on you.

142 2018-09-03 23:39:56 I was referring to the cannabis oil actually in that tweet. Sorry for not being more clear.
143 2018-09-03 23:39:54 Got into an argument with my mother yesterday about whether I could throw out a 12 year old bottle of sesame seed oil because it is "expensive".
144 2018-09-03 23:39:40 You basically cook your rice pike nornal, but you cut the hot dogs up, throw em in a pan that's really hot with oil. The moment the dogs start to cook, toss in as much stir fry sauce as you wabt and garlic salt. Push the dogs around and once it's all ready, just put it all on top
145 2018-09-03 23:39:29 I'm so into the simplicity of the dish names in this book. Fish soup. Breaded swordfish. Fried tuna semen. Meat roll. Kid with almonds. Pasta with potatoes. Pasta  with sea urchins. Tuna with onion. Orange salad. (just oranges w oil & salt + pepper)
146 2018-09-03 23:39:22 Combining natural health remedies together such as hempseed oil and cinnamon or garlic and onions creates a vitality-boosting chemical synergy whereas combining multiple pharmaceuticals more often than not can be extremely damaging to living cells and in turn, living tissue.
147 2018-09-03 23:39:20 If Canada turned off oil (we have 10 times what Saudi's have) American cars would run out in 4 days, if Canada turned off Unranium (we have 80% of the planets supply) America would lose power in 77% of their cities within 6 months.  Oh and we have 90% of fertilizer, starv fucker.
148 2018-09-03 23:39:17 unfortunately the solution to a green environment is Through the use of Fossil fuels , with the fuel how will your diner make it to the Table, no only does oil run the world, the fact is this without oil , water , Bee's and Solar mankind will die off in 15 to 20 years
149 2018-09-03 23:39:02 This type of rhetoric couldn't be further from the truth. Bitumen oil goes through several stages of refinement process, requiring gallons of water to dilute until it leaves us with a crude variant and a massive carbon footprint. #StopLine3
150 2018-09-03 23:38:51 I just added chili sesame oil to my dish. Now, my lips are burning.

157 2018-09-03 23:37:33 I managed to not buy any dice but I did walk away with a ton of art and a new @GamerConcepts shirt.

Ps: I have those same oil slick metal dice. I love them.
158 2018-09-03 23:37:30 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!
159 2018-09-03 23:37:22 What is gradtitude? Mat 25:3 If they had no oil what could they possibly give the bridegroom. What else is in oil to you? :) Precious oil placed on the forehead. The place of remembrance.
160 2018-09-03 23:37:21 Truth, car seduced me, when I own an oil company I will buy one! 
161 2018-09-03 23:37:18 No, but spilled wheat attracts bears and other animals to feed along train tracks, where they are hit and killed by passing trains. Presumably LNG and refined oil products also pose a risk to coastal waters.
162 2018-09-03 23:37:16 He chuckled warmly back. 

“I did, and it’s working. Too well, I might say.” 

She was so precious.

He retrieved the bottle of oil.

“Would you massage a little on my arms and fingers?”

There was still a dull ache from the hours of holding the queen’s crown firmly in place.

166 2018-09-03 23:36:24 Uranium mining is an investment just like oil, gas, coal or copper. The Russians like the prospects. American investors don't.

Russia doesn't need the metal; they already have plenty of plutonium in reserve and non-deployed weapons.

170 2018-09-03 23:35:49 I was scrubbing, girl! I mean, I think it’s great for all-day affairs. It’s also possible it was maybe the color? But I used a wipe-away oil, then a waterproof eye makeup remover, & my regular cleanser. And was still trying to wipe away remnants. Lol
171 2018-09-03 23:35:38 Iran has high oil reserves and needs nuclear fission technology? That  tech advance countries like Japan could not control? There are other  alternatives for Iran especially for it to go green energy. And at-least  trump is trying instead of arming countries with uranium XD
172 2018-09-03 23:35:37 I think i have to get my oil changed?? Not sure though
173 2018-09-03 23:35:34 Like the Clinton's? Like the Kennedys? How about Cheney? You are laughable that we finally have "heinous proof of treason" of campaign funds fraud.. lmao.

176 2018-09-03 23:35:27 Since Trump was there everything gettin worse for Pakistanis in SA, sometimes we should all think out of the box and read also between the lines. America is the biggest supplier for weapons and tech-eqiptmnt for them. America is the largest customer for oil and natural gas...
177 2018-09-03 23:35:22 I use to have this same issue in a real bad way. A combo of accepting my self for who and what I really am, exercise, CBD oil, and art have reduced that voice to a hollow whisper. Not saying you should do what I do bc everyone is different. Maybe it will give you ideas.
178 2018-09-03 23:35:05 Yam & Kale Salad:
- Preheat oven to 400F
- Toss in bowl the yams w/ 2 tablespoons of olive oil
- Bake until the yams, 20 to 25 minutes
- Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet
- Cook and stir the onion and garlic
- Put in kale until tender
- Combine all

180 2018-09-03 23:35:00 The 3 ventures that generate serious revenue (I’m talking real, large scale $) are war, organized religion, and oil & gas.  This fact pretty much explains nearly all of our public policy. #followthemoney
181 2018-09-03 23:34:49 Two words for this Charlatan: snake and oil.
182 2018-09-03 23:34:46 Citronella nd tea tree oil should deter spiders and other creepy crawlies. 
Mix both  with water put in a Small spray bottle and spray around doors and windows.  Bit smelly but worth it.
183 2018-09-03 23:34:34 nooo usually it's oil based, but they use eggs as well. it's a better version of mayo
184 2018-09-03 23:34:32 lol that’s good to know I’m saving that info for the future since I always have coconut oil in hand! 

But as you know how this scene plays out they had some oil in hand and I thought it would be interesting to use it. I’m so excited about those scene you have no idea
185 2018-09-03 23:34:18 Tires scare the crap out of me. Always afraid it blows as soon as I check it. If my steering is off n at oil changes I have it checked n of course when tires r changed for seasons
186 2018-09-03 23:34:03 And do you choose a pension fund that has no fossil fuel companies in it all, or buy anything plastic that was originally dug up as oil. I am all for being green, but we all patronise these oil companies all the time in ways we don’t even know
187 2018-09-03 23:33:58 Leave Syria alone. Anyone who doesn't rely on CNN knows the constant US assault on that country isn't about Assad, it's about oil, pipelines, and helping Israel maintain dominance.

If you're concerned about "human tragedy", then for God's sake, STOP FUNDING THE YEMEN GENOCIDE!
188 2018-09-03 23:33:55 You are assuming that your supporter want any oil investment supported. They don't. No pipelines, no refineries, no upgrades or extraction. Not now, not tomorrow, not ever.

213 2018-09-03 23:28:34 Dan, the carbon-tax revenues have directly helped the oil sands reduce their emissions and achieve energy efficiencies they didn't have, thus adding to their competitiveness, and that boosts the AB economy.

215 2018-09-03 23:28:10 How do I end up as the one who isn’t innovative? The future isn’t oil, that’s the side I’m on. But don’t agree, just don’t try to frame our oil sands as anything different than any other oil in the world. And why not argue for at least refining here instead of arguing with me?

218 2018-09-03 23:27:46 Nobody has ever called it a sin, but I dumo a whole bunch of nutritional yeast in my oatmeal along with salt and olive oil. I eat the stuff every day, so any sugar based additives would get unhealthy quickly.
219 2018-09-03 23:27:42 Solar is used for electricity generation. Very little oil is used in power generation. 
Oil and gas have multiple uses including transportation.  Almost everything we wear and use on daily basis has oil and gas in it.

228 2018-09-03 23:27:16 Albertans allowed the PCs to trade their future for tax-breaks in the present, which tax-breaks did nothing for the long-term health of the AB economy. And we're probably going to get left with a huge public liability in the form of the oil sands mess.
229 2018-09-03 23:27:13 What insane is not diversifying our markets and importing oil from countries who still behead people for any type of dissent.

239 2018-09-03 23:25:18 one of the pillars of the long oil thesis is that in the next couple of decades billions want to explore the world through travel. order-books for planes and number of airports under construction are truly staggering

241 2018-09-03 23:24:42 Jesus had a simple funeral?  People gathered to watch the man get nailed to a cross after carrying it, which by the way nailing was not the tradition, and then gets stabbed.  Then they put him in a tomb and was going to anoint his body with oil when he resed.

249 2018-09-03 23:23:25 A rally in Spanish, Italian and UK bonds suggests investors responded to the potential for lower rates for longer. The US Labour day holiday restrained trading. Currency markets steadied, but oil and lead gains reflected some appetite for growth @MicMcCarthy_CMC
250 2018-09-03 23:23:17 & Wesley Clark was a Democratic Presidential Candidate. Which means it’s his duty to make Republicans like Bush look good.

251 2018-09-03 23:23:15 No I was saying I should get her a real marijuana tincture and tell her it's CBD oil. I'm just teasing but it would be weird to see my mom stoned at 74 years old. What if she likes it lmao
252 2018-09-03 23:23:12 Recklessly? There are 60.000 foreign mercenaries of Al Nusra and Al Qaeda! You funded them to get the Oil and Gas! Keep your word and stay out of foreign affairs! Get your troups out if you can even control your administration.
253 2018-09-03 23:23:00 Boise pizza... potato, gruyere, cream, carmelized onions, olive oil and rosemary... it’s magical!
254 2018-09-03 23:22:42 I have tried CBD oil (Hemp based) a few times. Never had much result-wise until I started talking to a lady fairly recently who explained that there are several different methods of extraction, and depending on the method, the effectiveness changes. Will update on progress.
255 2018-09-03 23:22:38 It's a good time. Still hoping for a oil trucker Megs from the SS.
256 2018-09-03 23:22:19 Holy cow that is over cooked! Season with salt, pepper, olive oil and some rosemary. Make a honey mustard and barbecue glaze to be added after the salmon is done. And when I say done, I mean medium rare
257 2018-09-03 23:22:09 the reason why i’ll never drink coronas is because fucking david dobrik pranked all his friends with canola oil onstead of bear and now i always think the corona will taste like oil don’t ask me why

273 2018-09-03 23:20:38 The more healthy fats you eat, i.e. avocados, coconut oil, fatty fish like wild salmon, the slimmer you'll be. The more toxic fats you eat i.e. trans fats, sunflower, soybean, and canola oil, the fatter you will be. Schedule a consult by emailing me curtisholistichealth@gmail.com

275 2018-09-03 23:20:10 I agree there is more than the economy at stake. The solution is to continue with oil production AND build up solar, wind etc. until it gets is possible to wean off of oil. One does not shutdown investment in  to save the world.
276 2018-09-03 23:20:02 Illegitimi non carborundum man. Keep doing what you’re doing.
277 2018-09-03 23:19:38 It’s very aggressively peaceful.
If you’ve got some of the oil, it works pretty well as a spray.

279 2018-09-03 23:19:14 I'm thinking a minimum of 4-lanes in each direction with fast rail running up the middle. If we could get our oil to market, we could afford it.
280 2018-09-03 23:19:14 Anyone who does speak out is “in bed with oil”.  It would make no difference. There is always a label to be thrown at someone.
281 2018-09-03 23:19:05 My first job was at a self serve Arco too. Summer of the oil embargo...
282 2018-09-03 23:18:53 I put castor oil on my lashes to help the grow but i put too much and now everything is shiny help
283 2018-09-03 23:18:47 I personally think we should be able to choose how our tax dollars are spent when we file our taxes.... Oil companies do not need subsidies, in fact, a lot of our money is wasted by  the government on unnecessary spending  including Cabinet members, and Trump.

288 2018-09-03 23:17:55 Peak oil is an interesting one - averted thus far only because the price point is so high that it makes sense to do some crazy oil extraction. We have to run out eventually. On the other hand if we burn all we have, we'll hit the worst possible warming predictions :-(

292 2018-09-03 23:17:24 The oil crises were very real & devastated the world economy a couple of times, remember? One way we helped address it was by creating very effect fuel economy standards, which reduced oil use and also reduced air pollution dramatically.

If you don’t have any evidence except the statement of the enemies of the people you’re claiming “steal oil” you should probably refrain from believing it & claiming it as fact.

300 2018-09-03 23:15:56 I think he plays with the market and tariffs to reveal to the world our actual domestic output and daily availability of strategic metals and oil to the world so they know what level they need together to cause us to consume what’s available & unprepared for war here or anywhere.
301 2018-09-03 23:15:55 But the oil companies don't pay people to speak out against Engo's like Tides. There inlies the difference. A Big difference.
302 2018-09-03 23:15:55 Why are you trying to protect terrorists? Oh yeah.... You fund them. Assad said no oil theft  and no pipelines so the oil companies & Saudis want him gone.

Nobody wants to be branded a racist, which you can't disprove. First person to call the other a racist Is the winner, stakes claim to the moral high ground and is now safe
312 2018-09-03 23:14:03 The sooner we can move on from old energy: coal, to new energy:  renewables, the better we will be. The era of oil and coal must come to an end as we embrace the bountiful energy from the sun, the wind and the water.

316 2018-09-03 23:13:47 下北沢店でDVDを購入して、OIL AGE OSAKAの作品好きになりました。
因みに、昨年の「ペーパーカンパニーゴーストカンパニー」のDVDは入荷してるんでしょうか
もし在庫があるようなら、今週末に下北沢に行くので、観劇三昧さんにも伺いたいと思ってるのですが...

317 2018-09-03 23:13:40 You also have to remember Obama did what he could to stifle production as greenies like tucc believe that oil belongs in the ground.
Trump is promoting and encouraging oil production.
318 2018-09-03 23:13:33 BOOM! Trump's economy topples Russia as the leader in exporting refined oil. The U.S. exports $78 billlion a year, 1/3 more than 2nd place Russia.

320 2018-09-03 23:13:20 I reckon they think the price worth paying for the utterly astonishing failure to gain tax revenue from oil is to present the picture that Scotland relies on UK.Albeit, Scotland's the only part of the UK that produces enough food, power and fuel for its population & still export.

322 2018-09-03 23:12:41 @realDonaldTrump Mr President dont trust these senators goating you into firing AG Sessions. @LindseyGrahamSC is a snake oil salesman
323 2018-09-03 23:12:35 You're right, Mike, there will be a transition, and we need to be so strategic on how we access and use necessary hydrocarbons.  What's the carbon cost to import oil vs. use (not export) non-heavy domestic sources vs. using some tar sands here.  I'd like to know.
324 2018-09-03 23:12:27 He is too. Ironically Julius Hammer of CPUSA begat Armand Hammer, oil exec/US-Soviet diplomat. Interesting family.
325 2018-09-03 23:12:17 is there enough castor oil in the universe to clean him out tho??
326 2018-09-03 23:12:11 That is correct and then you have nut jobs like the CEO of Nestle who believes that water should be traded like a commodity, like oil. None free to anyone, all bottled and sold. I’ve boycotted Nestle for years.
327 2018-09-03 23:11:59 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
328 2018-09-03 23:11:54 We can easily mention our defence need with russia or Israel..also I'm case of oil Iran will be more trustworthy as we are contributing to chabhar port...

330 2018-09-03 23:11:26 Maybe the diamonds I got by the boatload? 
Replace diamonds with drums of oil
I think I may need some tats to complete the look
But no,in this professional world I gotta go by the clean look in the book
Or get the boot,toil,go on the unemployment boil & sweat...by the boatload.

337 2018-09-03 23:11:05 It would be an understatement to say that President Cárdenas in 1938 understood little about the legal and regulatory frameworks in which oil and gas companies would risk capital and in which, simultaneously, there would be solid public oversight.
338 2018-09-03 23:11:02 I worked the fry machine. So many oil burns
339 2018-09-03 23:10:39 basmati I add olive oil salt lima bean and garlic

341 2018-09-03 23:10:25 How the hell does a Museum gets burned? Did a person break into the Museum & just pour oil all over the walls & floors & throw a match?

It's literally a whole MUSEUM burning, there is no way someone didn't set the museum up with flammable oil.

346 2018-09-03 23:10:06 YES! I have tea tree oil as well but only use it every so often bc it’s pretty strong. But Vit E is great for skin (acne, scars, etc)..I just get the capsules and cut them open. #GetIt
347 2018-09-03 23:10:06 I made a nice healthy salad for dinner. I am using #SachiInchi seed oil as dressing.. I love it and it is so hard to find.
348 2018-09-03 23:10:02 Yesterday, I went to a @jiffylube for the first time while in Columbia, SC for an oil change. Just got back in Suwanee (4 hr drive) & got a call from my dad saying he found a large oil stain in his driveway after I left. Just checked my oil level & there is NOTHING in it. Not ok.
349 2018-09-03 23:09:58 Agree... 
In Oil/Gas Industry its becoming a bit of a race to find how blockchain can give an edge..a lot of proposals & many seminars(one very good one in London earlier this year on machine learning) but nothing yet that provides real direction... but the search is truly on :)
350 2018-09-03 23:09:46 And even though I washed it twice and put a hair mask, then two rounds of Moroccan oil, my hair still vaguely smells like ketchup. But I think it's less greenish now?
351 2018-09-03 23:09:44 Cart before horse. Russia had a Med naval base and a longstanding relationship with Syria. That (and wasn't there going to be a Qatari oil pipeline?) and by some strange coincidence US foreign policy led to some "moderate rebels" destabilizing the country. Funny that.

356 2018-09-03 23:08:59 Welp it's gonna cost me $100 to get my windshield replaced. That's my deductible cost and insurance will cover the rest. On top of that I have a $250 oil leak repair.

361 2018-09-03 23:08:30 Why are you dictating what the leader of another country can do to terrorist trying to destroy his country? Let me guess, wouldn't want all of that CIA funding and arming of terrorist to go to waste. Have to finish the oil theft for Rothschild Genie Oil. Shame on you.

373 2018-09-03 23:06:53 Joe, it also seems relevant that you mention that you are part of the world’s wealthiest 1%. A comfortable environmentalist. While Alberta employees are on EI, other oil producers are still ok and so are you.

381 2018-09-03 23:05:49 They did one better.  They put 15% of reserves into gold, marked to mkt qtrly.  Means as gold rises, the % of EUR gold rsvs rises.  Eventually it hits 100% at high enough gold price.  Makes EUR unsinkable (in extremis), & makes it very attractive to oil/energy exporters.

383 2018-09-03 23:05:19 I try to do them every month. If i don’t have avocado I’ll just do aloe Vera and coconut oil. Same concept. Leave in for 15-30 minutes and wash your hair after wards. If you want it to do it’s best job sit under the dryer while it’s in your hair. You’ll see a huge difference.

395 2018-09-03 23:04:08 I literally peel a whole avocado (it should be super ripe), take the seed out and throw it in the blender with a ripe banana, a whole egg, a table spoon of coconut oil and a table spoon of avocado oil. Blend it until it turns into a paste-y consistency. Massage into scalp.
396 2018-09-03 23:04:04 And he backed Bush in his campaign to kill hundreds of thousands if Iraqis to secure oil. God will punish the summer Graham
397 2018-09-03 23:04:01 veterans/military fight the wars but let’s be real we are fighting for oil, power & money not for the ppl... so all the Caucasian Americans who are now going to mention the military don’t, sacrifice isn’t always dying. Terrorist think they are dying for their cause
398 2018-09-03 23:03:46 Well, Turkey was minerally rich, but the real prize was Middle East oil. Iraq rebelled against British rule in summer '41, so was ripe for Axis co-option, as was Vichy Syria.

Not invading Russia means Germany evades the blockade.  Closing the Med at both ends hurts Britain a lot

401 2018-09-03 23:03:21 But bombing kids in Yemen is ok with you cause it is the oil rich Saudi ? How about the slaughter of innocents by the Israeli government? How many kids are still separated from their parents in your  camps? How many more people are going to fall out of windows in Russia?
Atrocity
402 2018-09-03 23:03:20 Non-profit claims no bias for big oil, who writes them "large" cheques. Yes, I have a bridge for sale too.

No tax deductible registration means they don't have to show the public whose really paying their paycheques by 'donation'.
403 2018-09-03 23:03:19 Olive oil is very smoky
404 2018-09-03 23:03:19 Nope. Dune is a crappy, (I think), science fiction movie, set on a desert like planet where they harvest something called "the spice". That "oil is our way of life..." blah, blah, just made me think of the mantra about "the spice" in the movie. #iguessyouhadtobethere

406 2018-09-03 23:03:06 He is ONE person!

By that logic I could say: Oh well Dick Cheney was Vice President which outranks General Clark and HE said it wasn’t about oil at all. Don’t use bad logic that can be thrown back at you.
407 2018-09-03 23:02:52 It's killing me today actually & my neck  now. I ordered a new dog lift sling.  My dog weighs 106 & he is having problems getting up & walking.  I starting the CBD Oil on him & I'm starting to see some improvement. But lifting him the past couple wks has taken a toll on my back.
408 2018-09-03 23:02:44 Your dear sweet daddy has said ALOT of things! I thought Mexico was going to 'pay' for the border wall? Your father is nothing more than a 'snake oil salesman'!!
409 2018-09-03 23:02:35 Very chickeny. All they have on them is olive oil, salt, and pepper.

412 2018-09-03 23:02:28 Does roasting the green beans in the oven with olive oil and salt make them healthier than canned green beans?
413 2018-09-03 23:02:18 We’ll have to get you a custom high dose bottle of olive oil

416 2018-09-03 23:01:42 Believable they support the oil industry however I can't have been the only lifelong ABn concerned about the pollution and toxic decimation of the province. That would be hard to believe. 
417 2018-09-03 23:01:29 If we went into renewable energy in a big way - like geothermal in B.C. plus wind and solar, we could be completely independent have 8 X the jobs without the environmental degradation, health issues or spills that go with oil. No one ever fought a war over solar.

419 2018-09-03 23:01:18 Harvard was complicit in the lie because they had a minority quota to meet, and they'd be damned if they were going to hire some filthy Asian.
420 2018-09-03 23:01:15 No, it was used in place of oil during the massage. Slightly different texture than oil, but doesn’t harden up like paraffin. It melts in to the skin and leaves it super soft. I meant to buy one and forgot. It’s actually pretty great.

423 2018-09-03 23:00:48 So are you mad enough to give back the dirty oil money you made off AB taxpayers when @RachelNotley hired you? Didn't think so.

443 2018-09-03 22:58:45 No, I'm not "blaming" oil. I'm saying the high oil price ($110 at the peak of his regime) masked the damage he was doing to the country's economy.

455 2018-09-03 22:57:04 I’m very much into essential oils! I’ve lived on oregano and clove to kill inflammation. I’ve tried copaiba which is supposed to be similar to CBD but didn’t feel any effect on the inflammation. Would be interested in trying the actual CBD oil.
456 2018-09-03 22:56:57 A long time ago, vaguely recall that rich fuel mixture was one color, and oil blow by another. But mixture screws and timing lights are ancient history now. Might double check that the choke is not stuck closed
457 2018-09-03 22:56:45 This.
458 2018-09-03 22:56:43 The US doesn't want that. The CIA & military have invested too much time & $$ creating the terrorists to overthrow Assad. He already told them no oil theft and no pipelines. The US is protecting their terrorist operatives. The US is not the good guys.
459 2018-09-03 22:56:42 i put some good old oil in my ear and usually it all drips out pretty quick when i get up but this time nope im just deaf
accidentally prodded a sensitive bit (probably impacted again bc im not a lucky person) and OHHH THE SUDDEN PAIN
460 2018-09-03 22:56:15 The real question is at what point did they try to pour olive oil down the hole to lubricate your hand.
461 2018-09-03 22:56:01 Yep. I tried everything!! I also just cut about 2 feet of my hair off a few weeks ago so it totally works. Just plain coconut oil from the grocery store!! Nothing fancy or expensive!
462 2018-09-03 22:56:00 You dont think Donny is trying to wage a financial war against... Gee... The planet?  His threats of financial ruin are no different. He is after our oil- water and timber.
463 2018-09-03 22:56:00 During #oilpulling, the oil gets emulsified and surface area of the oil gets increased….This oil will coat the teeth and gingiva and inhibits bacterial co-aggregration and plaque formation
464 2018-09-03 22:55:56 Need some good beard oil. Any recommendations?
465 2018-09-03 22:55:46 any product containing palm oil should be sanctioned
466 2018-09-03 22:55:43 All I am saying is that Texas, a previous republic and an oil state, has done quite well as an American state - no reason why Alberta couldn’t as well.
467 2018-09-03 22:55:38 I know some ppl are bad & some rise to power, but I have a hard time believing this isn't a PSYOP or even a false flag designed to keep the oil flowing. #McCain gone but were still running his playbook. Prove me wrong by preventing the attack altogether. Otherwise I call 
468 2018-09-03 22:55:37 I believe he does despite the act put on when he was ousted. He made a sweet deal for himself with Putin & Exxon in the N. Arctic oil deal. From what I read, I suspected the link from N. Arctic Oil to Saudi Arabia, tying in Trump $ laundering, but hadn't considered Venezuela.

472 2018-09-03 22:54:56 Whenever people bring up the "War for oil" bollocks I just point out it'd be much easier for the US to invade Canada than somewhere on the other side of the world in a region infested with religious fanatics.
473 2018-09-03 22:54:44 Noticed that, and just prior to that they called on oil gen as if they were anticipating drop of the gas gen. Hydro and "other" also ramped up. But would that, in itself, account for today's extremely high pricing. Seemed at 3:25 p.m. that ISO-NE had misforecasted peak load.
474 2018-09-03 22:54:24 I swear the debt feels like it's been a loss for more than 5 years! The corruption is real. My head still can't get around making a loss off oil in any way lol. Even if these guys thief money, at least generate revenue to keep the cash cow going! So stupid.

477 2018-09-03 22:53:59 Oil was a factor in making this beautiful land A LAND OF MILK & HONEY for many many, unfortunately govt. Anti business policy has turned Milk sour and Honey gone bad.
478 2018-09-03 22:53:55 Can't see palm oil product go any further. It's hard to attract big investors when "0% Palm Oil" is already a marketing tagline in Europe.
479 2018-09-03 22:53:51 Before Barack phoned me that day I had turned on the news and seen that an oil company called BP had spilt oil into the gulf of Mexico killing 11 people and millions of fish, as jaw dropped at the headlinethe phone rang and I’ll never forget what came next (ends on next tweet)

481 2018-09-03 22:53:43 British Columbia economy is based on there being no more oil spills, not on greater risk of more oil spills. 82 spills along the existing KinderMorgan TransMountain pipe since 1960 is not a good record to invest in.

484 2018-09-03 22:53:31 Adding grapeseed oil to the sweet almond and tea tree oil mix was a very good idea.
485 2018-09-03 22:52:59 Moderation is important. I need a moderate amount of money to live in a moderate home and feed my kids a moderate amount of food. All of that comes from oil and the jobs that prepare it for us. Unless we plan to stop importing it, why sacrifice ourselves on the export side??

491 2018-09-03 22:52:01 I believe McDonald’s deep fry their fries in car oil
492 2018-09-03 22:51:54 I think we're like drunks or drug addicts. We know what we're doing is wrong and a day of reckoning will come, but that addiction to oil is a sweet rush. Just one more year, one more hit. . . .
493 2018-09-03 22:51:53 Yeah but this is due to US sanction, CIA funding terrorists, KSA/US oil embargo.

500 2018-09-03 22:50:45 Agree. Individual wells can be operationally profitable. But an oil & gas co. needs to account for all costs. Because they incur all the costs. Land acquisition, capex, capital, human, service, admin, working capital. Oh wait, that’s free cash flow! Don’t and you’re just lying.
501 2018-09-03 22:50:38 would the troops coincidentally happen to capture their oil fields

509 2018-09-03 22:49:44 HAHAHA THAT'S SMART..!! I don't eat it with a lot of the broth and just use the sesame oil to eat with the noodles
510 2018-09-03 22:49:43 Think of the pools of engine oil and coolant that will accumulate on the floor...along with the buildup of carbon dioxide in the building.
511 2018-09-03 22:49:31 They fight for the corporation money. Wake up! You earn no penny in those oil deals but earn foreclosures instead!!
512 2018-09-03 22:49:10 I'm not the anecdotal for you.  Are you NOT reading anything I've linked? I said Cannabis oil AND a vegan diet. Vegan alkaline diet is what you should be saying if you have cancer and want to give yourself the best chance. It's THC that kills cancer cells. Read.

515 2018-09-03 22:49:00 Answer: Because the ONLY THING Trump is good at. Is selling Snake Oil.
516 2018-09-03 22:48:51 I LOVE THE SESAME OIL VERSION. Like I even add extra sesame to it tbh. I remember my parents calling it doll hair noodles and used it as an excuse for me to not buy dolls like that...it worked very well.
517 2018-09-03 22:48:47 I've stopped eating wheat but still have some inflammation, not like fire tho, and taking Omega-3's will enhance the CBD oil...I have found coupons to save at CBD+ and some have online specials you can mention at the store.

524 2018-09-03 22:48:15 Why do you think Trump keeps telling all citizens lies after lies , he is the best snake oil salesman , and a charletton.

Repeatedly hearing a lie actually makes us believe on it. This is called "Illusion of Truth" and it effects 100% of all humans.
525 2018-09-03 22:48:01 Too bad they detest the oil sands. Those oil sands flow a lot of tax dollars into the federal coffers. People that like government support want this to continue, right? Or is this more liberal cognitive dissonance?
526 2018-09-03 22:47:54 This woman come & offset me with this citronella oil & now I'm ready to takeoff 
527 2018-09-03 22:47:53 He did nothing. The market  affects commodities like gas very much, aka Supply  and Demand. We have yet to see the difference in prices from the opening of new oil routes into the U.S. mainland from Alaska & Canada

531 2018-09-03 22:47:41 What I like best is the pools of engine oil and coolant being left on the floor of this building.  The buildup of carbon dioxide is a nice feature, too.

535 2018-09-03 22:47:01 Let’s make it easy and have YOU name a time when the US has ever done that.  Or are you one of those people who think  Iraq was for oil despite the fact American oil imports come from Canada & the cost of gas went UP. Just another unfounded accusation like the “racism” claims.

547 2018-09-03 22:45:40 C) as has been demonstrated so well in last decade, with the global banking crisis and oil slump. We benefit hugely from being part of the UK. It makes no sense to me to favour the EU over the UK. It’s late, I’m off to bed- been nice talking - sorry you are so scared
548 2018-09-03 22:45:40 Lmao I'm still one step ahead bro. Go get  confirmed. Let the Bishop anoint you with the oil of Crism. 
549 2018-09-03 22:45:18 Fresh gas, oil level good, new filters this February, not many hours on it... so I’ll have to look at the spark plug
550 2018-09-03 22:45:17 Brent Oil was $10/barrel when Chavez became president in February 1999.  $78 today.  Not fair to blame oil for the failure of Chavez's "21st Century Socialism"
551 2018-09-03 22:44:54 Coconut Oil is a Goal....
552 2018-09-03 22:44:42 The point is there ins nothing “worse” about the oilsands. And Canada has better environmental laws, human rights, and labour laws than many other oil producers. So ha ha.
553 2018-09-03 22:44:40 My rose oil is my favorite thing ever.

556 2018-09-03 22:44:23 It was homemade and mostly oil free so... yes. Also compared to other options... yes.
557 2018-09-03 22:44:18 Have a look at spark plug condition... bad piston rings could allow some blow by, that you'd see evidence on the plug. Otherwise, ckeck the usual - clean gas, filters, oil level
558 2018-09-03 22:44:06 Going to get an oil change is such a chore. But, it’s done

562 2018-09-03 22:43:42 turned on the wrong burner so ive been rolling my cabbage around in cold oil for a few minutes 
563 2018-09-03 22:43:17 while putting some pierogis down in the pan the other night my gf accidentally splashed some of the oil onto my hand so now i have a little heart shaped (kinda) burn on my hand lol
564 2018-09-03 22:43:01 You should really declare your interest in your prolific EV bashing tweets Dick: “oil industry veteran and stake holder in fuel cell technology.”
You stand to make personal profit if successful in discouraging the uptake of EVs.
565 2018-09-03 22:42:48 Don't want to splurge on oil blotting sheets? Take a thin toilet-paper square and use it to blot excess oil on your T-zone.
566 2018-09-03 22:42:46 America is a net exporter of oil... may I know which resources es they want to exploit?
567 2018-09-03 22:42:05 Still a member of the European Parliament, fleecing off the EU he wants deleted, and now on a war path against a religion, striking fear into gullible ppl, like the snake oil salesman he is. A disgrace he gets airtime! #VisaFail
568 2018-09-03 22:41:47 By the sounds of it yes. That way Genie energy (Rothschilds, Dick Cheney, Bibi, Rupert Murdock & co) can get on with taking the oil

Also Israel can maintain its plan of destabilising all its neighbours at the expense of: however many goyim lives are necessary

572 2018-09-03 22:41:08 That’s like going to get an oil change and they say something else wrong. Look I didn’t come in here for that.
573 2018-09-03 22:41:07 Let’s get real, they’re dying so that the most powerful in our country can make money off oil and weapons 
574 2018-09-03 22:40:59 Probably an essential oil “business” selling to her FB friends. 
575 2018-09-03 22:40:48 You gotta get regulated gas prices down there. The price of gas only changes twice a month here, based on the price of oil. You know when and by how much it's going to change.

582 2018-09-03 22:39:57 Not amused and hungry. Last time I ate was at 4pm PDT yesterday. I can't go to a restaurant here bc we're waiting for info. Help @jimmyjohns I'll take a club lulu no tomatoes with oil/ vinegar  wrapped in lettuce please.
583 2018-09-03 22:39:53 I do *not* know anything about cars. "Oil-stick? oil doesn't stick?"
584 2018-09-03 22:39:38 Done my Google’s nigga and this is the best one. Is my name Hubert to be paying £50 for beard oil?
585 2018-09-03 22:39:29 Natural hair can be a task, mehn, I remember when I put coconut oil in my hair...my scalp was on FIRE.
586 2018-09-03 22:39:16 I’ve got a Craftsman YT3000 mower with a 21 horse Briggs and Stratton engine that has started blowing solid gray exhaust when running. Am i burning oil, or?? 

*Thoughts appreciated*

588 2018-09-03 22:39:11 Avocado oil, olive oil moisturiser and some homemade cream with Shea butter and rapseed oil!
589 2018-09-03 22:38:50 Yes, because US foreign policy makers really care for middle eastern people...???

Are you joking me? 

Iraq 1 million dead

Syria = war for Israel & meant to destabilise Iran for future wars of empire/oil/greed/Rothschild family 

Afghanistan = poppies for opiates
590 2018-09-03 22:38:37 Do you seal your moisturiser in with an oil? If so try switching to jojoba oil. It’s the closest oil to our natural sebum and works like a charm. Also do a porosity rest. Helps find the exact products that would work well for your hair texture and type.
591 2018-09-03 22:38:31 Let me help you.  I’m blocking you first for being a dishonest snake oil salesman.  Bye.

604 2018-09-03 22:36:31 motor oil isnt for drinking

636 2018-09-03 22:31:31 We are more reliant on them so much we sell our products cheaper to them then our own citzens. Ask your self this if 60% of our gas comes from USA refining of our own Oil then why does it cost less for them then it does for us to buy gasoline from our own Oil.
637 2018-09-03 22:31:29 Olive oil
638 2018-09-03 22:31:26 I have a jar of olive oil that i filled with garlic and rosemary that i use to brush on, it makes a nice crust.
639 2018-09-03 22:31:20 The first week of college when you have your own place is all making breakfast and dinner together, grocery shopping thinking you REALLY got a hold of adulthood. And by the second week you asking your neighbors for some oil and eggs. 
640 2018-09-03 22:31:13 Absolutely not, but a broken economy dependent on oil, an expensive nuclear programme, state sponsored terrorism activities abroad, failed reforms & missmanagement at home is the same as during the soviet union.

654 2018-09-03 22:28:55 All this “clamoring” for restructuring is targeted at the north and its all about crude oil revenue not Nigeria’s development.

656 2018-09-03 22:28:49 True. Of course it won’t continue as we live it *with* oil either. Good luck to today’s kids and their kids. They’re gonna need it.
657 2018-09-03 22:28:41 There's nothing in that tweet about raising any taxes on labor and the middle class. Big oil sells a product we all need. Not sure why any ordinary Americans fight for big oil to keep their slumlord tax rates.

659 2018-09-03 22:28:23 Because it is true. When it comes to government revenues; only 2 out of 26 categories are based on collecting Scottish data and one of those is oil revenue which is based on an 'estimate'.

667 2018-09-03 22:26:54 Do you actually think lithium mining pits are any better than oil sands? If you are, you are misguided. No energy is free, oil is just the most available and cheapest way to fuel the world at the moment. Electric cars will have their time in 20-40 years.

688 2018-09-03 22:23:02 10/18 - Oilers | 10/19 - Oil Kings | 10/20 - Oilers | 10/21 - Oil Kings | 10/22 - FF | 10/23 - Oilers ...going to need a nap after that
689 2018-09-03 22:23:00 The same Ryan Zinke who erased climate change from US policy docs, opened national parks for oil drilling, lifted Obama-era moratorium on coal mining, and suggests climate change has nothing to do with wildfires?
690 2018-09-03 22:22:46 Argan oil
691 2018-09-03 22:22:14 Not for money. Not for oil!
692 2018-09-03 22:21:43 But what about the bigly oil?
693 2018-09-03 22:21:18 Or raising children in two parent homes
694 2018-09-03 22:21:03 Bill/Millionaires are happy, workers are barely staying even with the cost of oil and inflation.  
You can’t fool all the people all the time.

702 2018-09-03 22:19:58 His understanding did not translate into any action. The federal Liberals have done more for the oil sands than the Conservatives ever did.
703 2018-09-03 22:19:54 Huge mistake Nike !!  Done with your products.
704 2018-09-03 22:19:41 The only limit that can be placed on frying is the size of the vat and quantity of available oil
705 2018-09-03 22:19:41 Speaking of naming stats after people. I remember back in the old HF turning into this new Oil blogger crowd days like 2005-2008ish. Their poster boy for advanced stats god was Shawn Horcoff. Then he was having a season that was awful according their their stats. So they...
706 2018-09-03 22:19:40 My poor friends working for big oil. All these decades of high salaries and benefits and now I have to tell them that the companies did not care for them. Those $10000.00 retention bonuses were given to them every once and a while out of spite!
707 2018-09-03 22:19:24 my breath smell like motor oil
708 2018-09-03 22:19:15 somebody get my oil changed
709 2018-09-03 22:19:08 That mullah economics 101! Oil fished out from under the ground and the money for it just vanishes in the thin air above the sky! The supply & demand-from earth to sky and heavens where god lives! Humans just exist in the middle not as rational beings but as slaves!

712 2018-09-03 22:18:50 I didn't say anything about sweatshops.  I do avoid all Apple products as we know they are all made by children in China and Apple enjoys a 40% plus profit margin.  Oil companies are around 7%.  Nike will suffer from this decision.  We will see how much.  Good day.
713 2018-09-03 22:18:46 Bob Ross making an oil painting of a house, “this roof is old and had a rough life like me, lotta rain come through.”
714 2018-09-03 22:18:28 need more oil!
715 2018-09-03 22:18:11 The country deceived by a snake oil salesman. They thought he is a miracle cure and all he is, is piss.
716 2018-09-03 22:17:51 Please negotiate with the oil companies to lower prices at the pump.  And BTW if you touch Social Security or Medicare us boomers will vote you and all the republican cronies out of office.  You made the rich "a lot richer"<-your words at Mar a Lago.
717 2018-09-03 22:17:50 “Yeah, all we’ve got here is the oil refineries. If you want something fun to do, go up to Berkeley. That’s where 924 Gilman is. Live music man, it’s great.”
718 2018-09-03 22:17:30 Bikes don't leak oil they mark their territory.
719 2018-09-03 22:17:21 Of course, you are right. ROI is, however, a complex, uncertain calc for so many companies (sh gas and tight oil). FCF provides a quick, high-level way of taking the temperature of the sector. The balance you seek is hard to find w/ infinite capital flows to sh gas/tight oil.
720 2018-09-03 22:17:16 Just not Canadian Oil
721 2018-09-03 22:17:08 Very addicting! This is one of the best Chili Oil I’ve ever tasted! It’s a must have! 
722 2018-09-03 22:17:08 Hello @beardshevlin! Nice to meet you. May your tweets be volumnious and your oil be plentiful.
723 2018-09-03 22:17:06 So I went on a Rib to see the Beatrice Windfarm under construction and the old Beatrice oil field now being deconstructed.
724 2018-09-03 22:16:59 Another exit route for Canadian oil
725 2018-09-03 22:16:55 Burning that midnight oil 
726 2018-09-03 22:16:48 so, you add an ocean and have a criminal boat dock and a coast guard  boat dock and add boats that you can drive... and you have to drive to the middle of the ocean to rob something like an oil rig and you have to bring it back to the boat station to get money
727 2018-09-03 22:16:45 "Lookin' fine, bro! Check it out, we both got scarves! Now that's stylin'!" (Oil Man, MM Powered Up)
728 2018-09-03 22:16:33 Seriously, I'm a virgin! Where do you think they get virgin olive oil?
729 2018-09-03 22:16:32 I was thinking more along the lines of mobile large battery banks, like oil tankers but for carrying electricity.
730 2018-09-03 22:16:24 Hmmmmm, no, Monopoly Guy definitely got rich from fracking for oil or whaling or something like that. He has no time for frivolous pursuits like brain surgery
731 2018-09-03 22:16:20 I've heard a lot of people saying they have been helped by that oil. keep on coping mate, that's all we can do.
732 2018-09-03 22:16:18 @stucam7771  Yes, 401k investments doing very well, lots of job opportunities, businesses spending money on projects, oil and gas and coal all providing jobs and tax revenue.  It’s very nice.
733 2018-09-03 22:16:10 All the First Nation bands that have sided against Trans Mtn should have all funding cut off explaining that without oil revenues there is no money to pay for all their needs
734 2018-09-03 22:16:09 But, unlike this Administration, no one will be immune, however don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
735 2018-09-03 22:16:03 All natural/organic cleansers, face masks, aloe Vera, tea tree oil. Everything needs to be from the earth
736 2018-09-03 22:16:01 Hope everyone had a great labor day weekend. I was fortunate enough to take friday and tuesday off. I'm in Raleigh visiting my daughter and grandson.  Made filet mignon for dinner yesterday and lobster tails. Sauteed fresh spinach with olive oil & garlic, caesar salad,rebaked
737 2018-09-03 22:15:53 Do you have coconut oil?
738 2018-09-03 22:15:23 Burping up fish oil/CLA pills is the worst 
739 2018-09-03 22:15:22 It is my true face. I had a build up of an almond oil based conditioner that I couldn't get rid of and was informed dish soap works. I didn't just dip my head in with the dishes. This time.

748 2018-09-03 22:14:13 @LaBeautyologist Do you recommend sea buckthorn oil to oil cleanse?
749 2018-09-03 22:14:12 Oil is so 20th century. Our Earth, and the last remaining places that remind us what it used to be like, are key to our survival now.
750 2018-09-03 22:14:05 Obviously Twitter does not ban perverts.
751 2018-09-03 22:13:55 Has he told you he's an oil rig engineer yet? 
752 2018-09-03 22:13:47 I overdid it with the tea tree oil. That smell is skrrongggg on me
753 2018-09-03 22:13:34 Extra  Virgin  Olive oil 
754 2018-09-03 22:13:29 wash it more often... if you're washing once a week, try twice, moisturise with a cream and oil straight after, then put into canerows. ask @LekpahShandii it really works.
755 2018-09-03 22:13:27 I’ve heard using castor oil helps! Idk try it 
756 2018-09-03 22:13:12 That's because socialism is being sabotaged globally. Look at Venezuela, it is being put under sanctions only because certain powerful people in the world want its oil to be privatised so that they can individually benefit from it.
757 2018-09-03 22:13:12 lmaoooooo man is chatting "Hausa" to you uno
758 2018-09-03 22:13:08 Not much oil found in London 
759 2018-09-03 22:12:48 Over to you @GasBuddyDan. Apparently you believe that big oil went south because they don’t care about Canadian jobs.
760 2018-09-03 22:12:42 You still won't answer why we aren't at war with Canada if this is about oil  BTW, the largest gold mines in the world aren't anywhere near the ME, so how is this war about oil and gold.  Your meme is just pure ignorance and lies
761 2018-09-03 22:12:35 IF the mkt requires the oil from LTO, it will have to pay for it, or not require it (economic alternative). Business will demand max profit, consumer will demand lowest cost. Is there a price curve that both maintains demand, while reaching profit? I say yes. 2/
762 2018-09-03 22:12:19 & you haven't aged a day. What's your secret? Bathe in the blood of virgins? Deal with the Devil? Oil of Olay?
763 2018-09-03 22:12:14 False advertising.  It should be stand for oil companies.
764 2018-09-03 22:12:09 Having to constantly smell like tea tree oil since I have to smother my skin with it to keep the mosquitos off. Why does my boyfs house have to be on the canal??

Cook it up in some olive oil, add a minced clove of garlic near the end, awesome
770 2018-09-03 22:11:31 Their crunch-coating was coconut oil...stuck to the roof of ur mouth. Got funky tasting in hot weather...
771 2018-09-03 22:11:14 Better knit yourself one cause you might need it when you transfer citizenship to Russia. I hear it gets cold there especially when you have no heating oil or coal
772 2018-09-03 22:11:12 Government: try to express emotion through singing "well" and having them get to take someone's oil!!

774 2018-09-03 22:10:50 I wouldn't vote for you if my life depended on it. You're just another snake oil salesman masquerading as a politician. Texas stands behinds Florida to keep Floroda Red! So no to #Communism #KeepAmericaGreat
775 2018-09-03 22:10:47 ROCK N ROLL!!  YAY! :)  You and him are like water and oil.

777 2018-09-03 22:10:42 Openly selling on the market, the value of Saudi oil drops and we lose money. Anyway, it’s the groups already doing business with the west who spread the violent ideology behind Isis, Al Quaeda, and their proxies around the world
778 2018-09-03 22:10:28 Was it an oil burn? Because if so you should always immediately make sure to get the oil off with soap or something similar because it'll sit on the skin and worsen the burn if you don't.

782 2018-09-03 22:10:04 Funny how much distant we are now, how much we grew apart now?, we forgot each other completely now,, almost permanently.
One time we were inseparable, now we’re like oil and water even when brought together we r never miscible.
783 2018-09-03 22:09:53 Who can change my oil 1st and 2nd period in auto tech 
784 2018-09-03 22:09:20 And you’ve done the analysis on the environmental and ethical impacts of oil from Venezuela or the Middle East, versus the Oil Sands, have you?  You’re confident in saying we should constrain Canadian production with addnl taxes and people should buy their (untaxed) oil instead?
785 2018-09-03 22:09:05 Some hair oil. Camille Rose me please
786 2018-09-03 22:09:04 Dude don’t even know what transmission oil is 
787 2018-09-03 22:09:02 Excellent set of comments Jason. Two things I'd add: there's no transmission from a possible shale oil bust to a systemic financial crisis. And higher interest rates favour short-cycle production versus long megaprojects
788 2018-09-03 22:08:32 There was a time in human existence, where we lived without oil and gas, and I'm quite certain we can find away to do without it.  Canada is getting nowhere fast, because It keeps beating a dead horse, instead of moving on, and looking to the Future.
789 2018-09-03 22:08:31 It would be nice to see @Crystal69Rivers feet tickle for 1 hour,with brush  and nails,with oil under your feet but without break,witout letting breathe and without safeword. In this way(no breaks / no safeword)you will be literally tortured
You're so cutie under tickle torture
790 2018-09-03 22:08:18 It's rare to see outside of NHRA; @CruzPedregon is a class act that cares about the fans & interacts with them because he wants to, not to promote the latest version of some spark plug or oil.
791 2018-09-03 22:08:15 Well all the Iraq Gold of Hussain and Oil hasn't gone into this economy. Trillions missing from Pentagon? This isn't war. We need out of this power drain. Peace

800 2018-09-03 22:07:16 Fast food options are the lamest in the U.S + food is fried and refried with old oil to the point it helps you stick to healthy eating tbh.

808 2018-09-03 22:05:41 US & Canada closed for holidays. Win canola down A$2.96/t on currency move. EU rape down A$1.47. EU rape futures down against stronger euro despite gains in Malaysian palm oil. Crop reductions for EU rape already in market.
809 2018-09-03 22:05:40 Actually we are paying back debt incurred by our elite on expensive toys like F 16s often in the form of taxes on items of essential consumption like that tooth paste, soap, shampoo, bus, plane, train, & cinema tickets, kerosene oil, literally everything.
810 2018-09-03 22:05:40 Once had one water damage,would cover cost of walls & ceilings,but not woodwork because that was oil based it was also water damaged !

812 2018-09-03 22:05:06 Lol!!! Or do you remember the time I tried to make stew and I ended up cooking it for hours! Had to call Ima to come and all I had to do was add oil. Or the terrible spaghetti I made that you and Temi said was sweet 
813 2018-09-03 22:05:05 i thought you only traded off the DOM and didnt use charts?
814 2018-09-03 22:05:04 Yh In sha Allah
815 2018-09-03 22:04:53 Please explain with evidence how it would reduce oil imports via tankers when 100% of the dilbit it would carry is for export?
816 2018-09-03 22:04:49 Repaying Oil Bonds was one of the few best things #ModiSarkar did. Since, BJP has such shitty spokies, they even can't articulate positive stuff!
817 2018-09-03 22:04:46 Bullshit. There are alternatives for everything oil related.
818 2018-09-03 22:04:42 Officially a crazy oil lady. Made my first rollers and diffusing some immunity boosters. Drinking our Elderberry every day. All in on the natural germ fighters. At this point, it can’t hurt.

821 2018-09-03 22:04:33 Well, 'respectable people' get 'respectable seating'.  @IvankaTrump & @jaredkushner feel they DIDN'T get 'respectable seating'? They can always TRY being respectable.  BUT, something tells me 'respectability' and Trump and/or Kushner go together like oil and water.
822 2018-09-03 22:04:05 Spent $150 on an oil change and new filters for my air conditioner in my car & they didn’t properly screw my car skirt back on. Like hate half assed work. <<<< 
823 2018-09-03 22:04:02 I hear you.  I’m careful about the oil.
824 2018-09-03 22:03:57 No question.  But realistically, the pipelines are for export and aren’t going to reduce domestic dependence on foreign oil (or prices at the pump for that matter). And Energy East isn’t even viable at current oil prices without government subsidies.
825 2018-09-03 22:03:52 So you spent the day with union people? There are no unions in the Alberta Oil Patch! Looks like you are campaigning instead of doing your job. Fix the TMX! Do your job or resign!
@CBCNews @GlobalEdmonton @ctvedmonton @Edmontonsun @PnPCBC @charlesadler
826 2018-09-03 22:03:51 Expert no, just convinced by what I saw, and your junk that I had to clean up. I was hauling bags a dead animals from a oil spill and all you cared about was a the price of gas. But what do I care what you think, as far as I’m concerned you’re just flat earther in denial anyway.
827 2018-09-03 22:03:47 #FuelHike in 2018, Kenya started mining crude oil and the price of petroleum products went up by 20 ksh,  amazing!!!
828 2018-09-03 22:03:44 Went to get an oil change at Car Pros Kia in Carson, CA. The guy recommended a transmission fluid change so I said ok $260 later just so my check engine light turns on two days later. I left a message and this better not cost me a dime to fix @Kia @Kia_Motors

831 2018-09-03 22:03:08 Put some coconut oil on your ass cheeks, it’ll take the burn out... shitting is good for the soul  btw Vegan is awesome

833 2018-09-03 22:02:55 Pellegrini doing so woefully at West Ham after having won the league with City really goes to show how easy it is to win the league as long as you have endless £ of oil money funds.
834 2018-09-03 22:02:49 Saudi has been trying to run a pipeline through Syria for a long time but the Assad family won’t let them do it. Iran has been trying to break into the oil market, but Saudi and the deeply invested US want to keep supremacy and control of that supply chain. If Iran starts...
835 2018-09-03 22:02:40 Awesome cars! I was into Saabs and Volvos until we had 4 kids, then it was minivans and SUVs. My only Saab tip is make sure to be religious about oil changes — turbos are sensitive to oil quality and expensive to replace.

842 2018-09-03 22:02:12 Got a crystal ball? Oil companies would not be forced to charge less at the pump AT ALL. They could continue to charge whatever the market bears. Likely they would keep prices the same and just siphon more profit. #NoOn6

849 2018-09-03 22:01:13 There's one series that I loved as a kid and would love to bring back one day: Vigilante 8. It was such a cool premise: Vehicular combat in the western US following an alternate 1970s where the oil crisis is never resolved. The antagonists are HITMEN HIRED BY THE OIL INDUSTRY.
850 2018-09-03 22:01:12 Russia is created by deep state to help the Russian collusion fake case against TRUMP, China is the real threat, Venezuela supplies 15% of our oil.

854 2018-09-03 22:01:02 CBD oil works wonders on anxiety. My anxiety was so bad, I was itching all over and had tingling. Always on the edge of a panic attack. I had other issues too, but I used CBD and really mellowed out. It's not something I ever thought I use, but I was desperate for something.
855 2018-09-03 22:01:00 Today tomato leaf hacking back in polytunnel. Green ones in a paper bag flung in a dark corner. Mr M turning compost. Thinking about oven drying Polen and Moneymaker and bottling in oil as freezer is broken.  A friend has All our beans, crumbles, soups and fruits in her freezer.
856 2018-09-03 22:00:57 ... however the hazard of dropping & fracturing the batteries has increased as battery capacities rise and phone structures get flimsier.

So they're still a spark risk.

Having done oil industry electrical work for years, petrol stations are incredibly slapdash.
857 2018-09-03 22:00:46 The CSOs have a great deal to play in ensuring credibility in the oil & gas sector. But most times our hands are tied.
858 2018-09-03 22:00:44 All the while our media, both conservative and liberal, has spun the narrative to make the Shiites into the enemy to keep control of the oil markets currently dominated by the Saudis. It’s being used to justify the sanctions on Iran and the war with Syria...

900 2018-09-03 21:55:26 I love a daily ‘done list’, and you are busy but also enacting the time you made for not working and those two things are familiar and comforting to other academics. And also unfamiliar and wonderful (viz bog myrtle oil!)

902 2018-09-03 21:55:15 I started using a moisturizer with Cannabis oil in it about two weeks ago. My skin looks like is has foundation on it. 
903 2018-09-03 21:55:12 Noooo! Are you using oil based or always based products? I’ve found that oil base products don’t like my hair. I have to use water based ones
904 2018-09-03 21:54:15 wow... as much as u share this discloses wht ur govt has done to this system... olive oil in a bottle of vodka... sab ch. bethay hain...
905 2018-09-03 21:54:00 We do, but have you thought about all the trade agreements that would first be broken then somehow need to be negotiated again, and how Texas “the country” would compete against other consortiums and countries that produce more oil and have established trade practices?
906 2018-09-03 21:53:58 Yes I thought so too...

907 2018-09-03 21:53:50 I agree that gas is different than oil. In the end, Aubrey McClendon's belief in natural gas as the way forward might have been right.
908 2018-09-03 21:53:45 Burnt my two fingers with oil :((
909 2018-09-03 21:53:42 tell me again the diff between the steel. oil and railroad robber barons on the Gilded Age vs soy boy beta males of SillyCon Valley. they both used "slave" labor, pocketed gov''t corp welfare, stifled competition, used the power of a monopoly....oh, right, the soy boys are libs
910 2018-09-03 21:53:14 Well yes highly comparable if we were subject of continued US backed coups and sanctions, oh and if 95% of our exports were oil.

915 2018-09-03 21:52:09 We have oil and a lot of it.

928 2018-09-03 21:50:40 Nazi Germany's need for oil drove Hitler to attack the  Soviet Union. Patton's tanks used German oil to invade Germany. German people during WWII used wood gas to propel their cars and tractors.
And the German military used wood gas powered practice tanks.

933 2018-09-03 21:49:50 The astounding thing to me, is that regardless of ideology, if you have the worlds largest oil reserves and that is the goose laying the golden eggs, then by hook or by crook you would find funding to maximise production. How can this be failing ???
934 2018-09-03 21:49:45 You mean killing wage increases, or undermining mining regulation, or how about hurting public unions, maybe it was all the executive orders rescinding protection for the environment or oil field workers.

2. She then got her essential oil kit and made me smell the one titled “Joy.”

942 2018-09-03 21:48:51 . That article is so ridiculously inaccurate. The ethanol industry hasn't received a federal tax incentive since 2011 and ethanol helps to clean the air and reduce ghg emissions by 43% vs dirty oil. #FactsMatter
943 2018-09-03 21:48:46 I don't really think presidents (R or D) deserve much credit for these things. The other influences - global trade, oil prices, commodity prices - are just so huge and out of any one person's hands. We have yet to see the impact of tariffs, if they come to pass, so there's that.

952 2018-09-03 21:47:04 The flour mixture should taste good before it goes on the chicken. Let the breaded chicken rest. Watch the oil temp. Small batches. Don't crowd the pan. You can tell they're ready by the sound they make and the size of the bubbles. :)

961 2018-09-03 21:45:20 That’s true, but we shouldn’t forget the real crisis the Iranian currency is facing. This was not the case during the previous sanctions. Plus the new American strategy against Iranian oil export, plus the pressure from inside Iran by Iranian people. Together make huge difference

971 2018-09-03 21:44:03 I'm one of those men who sacrificed most of my life to Vietnam and I think you need to stop making assumptions for folks who know more about the way war works (oil) and HOW the freedom of speech I fought for is being disassembled by racists in the @NFL and Trump's admin #FedUp

977 2018-09-03 21:43:26 Oil to Quebec should be charged at $71 per barrel. Oil by rail only damn the rail spills. Alberta should withdraw from equalization, or better include hydro income in the equalization formula, then PQ becomes a have province

985 2018-09-03 21:42:42 First off, we were all lied to so that we would think its fossile fuels. Mother Earth always makes new oil. It is her lubricant for the tectonic plates. We are never going to run out, but we will have free energy soon, and no more need for oil, coal or nuclear power (IMHO).

1001 2018-09-03 21:39:58 Fortunately,it's unlikely they will let you run from a jail cell. If Kerry ran against you, he would win for sure. Iran deal, hmm no oil. Hey speaking of the oil we don't have, what happened to the "deal" you were tootin about with King whoever for 2 million barrels of oil? Lies?

1004 2018-09-03 21:39:35 I love being splashed in the face with hot oil from the fryer...I love it
1005 2018-09-03 21:39:33 That's poopy. Use aquaphor and coconut oil!  Stick ur feet in the fridge.
1006 2018-09-03 21:39:32 Time for BOTH Saskatchewan and Alberta to begin processing their oil products here at home BEFORE sending them to the USA. ..KEEP ANERICAN HANDS OFF OUR JOBS..

1011 2018-09-03 21:38:12 As a fellow MOT in the oil patch, I admittedly did a double take at this but I think he is saying that shale producers are similarly persecuted.
1012 2018-09-03 21:38:08 If Exxon is accurate in getting production to 750K barrels a day, this will be the richest oil producing country per person in the world. Less than 800K population - that’s a barrel of oil per day per person & will only grow beyond 2025.
1013 2018-09-03 21:38:06 Who said that no one said that was something wrong with that other than you why don't you tell the oil companies who are receiving taxpayer dollars that very same thing
1014 2018-09-03 21:38:00 Stick to keeping an eye on oil helping to poison the world with its many biproducts for your precious children - you clearly know nothing about cycling safety
1015 2018-09-03 21:37:48 Raw eggs. 
Olive oil. 
Aloe Vera.
1016 2018-09-03 21:37:46 SPR sales has been mandated and planned a long time ago.  This is small amount any way.  The question is, will we see a major release when the deadline for Iran sanctions hit? It would prevent an increase in oil prices.
1017 2018-09-03 21:37:41 Can you accommodate a dairy gluten allergy. Eggs and oil are fine
1018 2018-09-03 21:37:37 No—sorry Dems. Forget about it—no ones buying the snake oil you’re selling.

1020 2018-09-03 21:37:17 We would walk out to a gas station near the edge of town that sold fried "potato logs" for about 50 cents a bag. Eat a bunch and save the rest for breakfast with eggs. There was enough oil on them to fry the eggs too.
1021 2018-09-03 21:36:39 They need to build refineries
That would be a beginning to turn Nigeria's oil situation around. I hear they were working on it but progress is too slow.

1023 2018-09-03 21:36:03 It’s been almost 30 years - and it is that simple. The corrupt which hold Somalia today want the current system to proceed, but their not educated in running a country. So they outsource, tell me, what does Turkey( and others) get in return for their help? Oil,influence..ect
1024 2018-09-03 21:35:59 Hey @RachelNotley, your oil has made it to tidewater and heading offshore even without a pipeline expansion!  Maybe ask why you’re not already charging more for oil?!  #nopipelineexpansion
1025 2018-09-03 21:35:43 Odd, could it be an oil drip or something from the lens? Probably not if it's only one frame. Zooming in it looks it even changed the grain pattern inside the dot.
1026 2018-09-03 21:35:41 It helped for my son and me, hopefully it will work for you too, use lavender body wash too when you take your warm bath and lotion if available, but tried and tested ko na ang lavender oil sa base ng ear, just lightly massage it

1029 2018-09-03 21:35:01 Lol anytime my darling  And if you really want a good acv remedy, try doing an acv hair rinse once a week. Basically 1 tablespoon of acv in 1 cup of water +a few drops of any essential oil (I love lavender )& apply to your scalp after shampooing then just condition strands.
1030 2018-09-03 21:34:47 This seems like a deeply ahistoric read of what happened to the economy in the 70's. Globalization? Chicago School Economics? The Oil Crisis? Not to mention periods of deregulation followed by economic bubbles then collapse? The constant race to lower taxes on the 1%?

1032 2018-09-03 21:34:34 China’s involvement in Africa is taking a tremendous toll on natural ecosystems and wildlife. The Congo’s Great primeval tropical rainforests have all been pretty much logged by the Chinese and now being replaced with Palm Oil. Similar efforts elsewhere...

1044 2018-09-03 21:32:47 And that’s why the Rockefellers have funded groups like Tides and LeadNow in the millions to organize protests. These anti-pipeline/anti-Canadian protesters are literally working for big oil, whether they know it or not.

1050 2018-09-03 21:31:34 I keep wondering why would someone buy a bottle of olive oil and then get a bottle of liquor and then pour olive oil into a liquor bottle. Olive oli bottles come in all designs and shapes, are sleek, strong & quite presentable.
1051 2018-09-03 21:31:28 Yes and that same oil you use you can dab a little sa base ng ears mo and massage it a little, you can try almond or soy milk or lactose free milk
1052 2018-09-03 21:31:25 Coconut oil

1065 2018-09-03 21:29:13 for example, I just took a nice long bath in green tea and lemon slices, exfoliated with coffee grounds and coconut oil, drank a big ol glass of wine, and I’m about to make gnocchi with pesto for the first time. life is so fucking good if you let it be good
1066 2018-09-03 21:29:11 its ok, they can go somewhere else; their fast-food burgers are great; they remove the sup the oil from the fries by using clean towels or clean white paper towels befor serving it...
1067 2018-09-03 21:29:10 Really enjoy the shows late at night. Burning the midnight oil. Extra time is my bedtime guilty pleasure 
1068 2018-09-03 21:29:06 My face started to break out painfully bc I haven't shaved in a bit. Like, its itchy and kinda burning and it hurts so much? I tried throwing some tea tree oil on it to soothe it but n o.
1069 2018-09-03 21:28:53 Actually, the bullpen has been pretty damn impressive last 2 days. It’s Bud who has been leaking oil: 1+ IP, 3 HRs & 5 ERs. He survived August on smoke & mirrors but the bill has come due in September.
1070 2018-09-03 21:28:53 All good info ( except the part “They have been there for 600,000 years or more but we have never noticed it before” hahaha ) I love learning about the endocannabinoid system and love my oil !
1071 2018-09-03 21:28:53 I'm having a hard time focusing on the reading I need to get done before tomorrows class. Also, I keep smelling oil, as in something being deep fried, but there isn't anything being cooked. #College #Reading #Homework #Random

1073 2018-09-03 21:28:36 ... telling my nation lies and hiding the figures, convincing us that getting a fraction of our own money back (not counting oil) from WM is us being subsidised bcos we are too wee and poor to survive on our own but we are liable to pay some of the massive debt wm has built up?

1081 2018-09-03 21:28:14 oil R&D is more subsidized than solar R&D. Oil returns are guaranteed for shareholders by our government. I wish we were treated like the oil industry by all levels of government.
1082 2018-09-03 21:28:04 No one that is serious about analyzing finite non-renewable resource constraints uses the term doomer. For analyzing oil depletion and the hard facts of peak oil, the preferred term is realist.

2. My friend has been in Bun E’s drum barn
1089 2018-09-03 21:27:00 Worse than rain on a motorcycle at 80? After rain road mist. Sure it feels refreshing, until you remember that it's more gas, diesel and oil than water, with just a pinch of fecal matter....
1090 2018-09-03 21:26:49 then that’s bad sis !! try anything moisturising like rosehip oil or bio oil or something
1091 2018-09-03 21:26:08 I basically just spend over an hour in my bath brushing my teeth, putting on a face, body and hair mask, using body + feet scrub, doing my nails, shaving, soaking in the tub, putting on skin oil, and lotion.
Hoping that somehow I can scrub away my anxiety and wash of my sadness.
1092 2018-09-03 21:26:06 So true, and also:
-No oil changes & smog checks
-Brakes last forever (re-gen)
-No transmission, air filter, timing belt

The list goes on. TCO is a big reason why the #teslastretch works. Biggest reason is the Tesla Grin! Don't drive one if you're not ready to buy a Tesla.

1103 2018-09-03 21:25:23 @DreKnott , or anyone else. Possible silly question here, but, can MLB players use CBD oil leagally to help with pain and healing injuries?  Or is it banned?
1104 2018-09-03 21:24:55 Olive oil I heard is good :D
1105 2018-09-03 21:24:47 IR used the ol' "free shipping" and "Employees discount and financing" scheme. For IR, ust having the oil still being bought, at any price, is a win, by pissing off 45.
1106 2018-09-03 21:24:39 Thankfully, my fire-retardant beard oil worked. 
1107 2018-09-03 21:24:38 I understand plenty. U must have missed the facts that the U.S. + booming econ + No Paris + No CO2 Taxes + now #1 oil producer + lower EPA restrictions, means Canada isn’t doing it your way. Carb Taxes not wrking, SJW BS not wrking, Social license BS not wrking.
1108 2018-09-03 21:24:33 I need your "Editorial burning the midnight oil skills" my friend

1110 2018-09-03 21:23:31 my tea tree oil and acv toner from @LOLAandDOE 
1111 2018-09-03 21:23:26 WTF ?!
1112 2018-09-03 21:23:10 It’s crazy how many people suffer with anxiety and depression in silence,  the response I’ve had from everyone for putting them on cbd oil is crazy,  so glad to be helping people 
1113 2018-09-03 21:22:43 I bought @ZaneHellas oregano oil via Amazon UK. It comes directly from Greece takes a week to arrive in UK think it's about £15 a bottle. Be very careful with it. It is extremely strong and can burn you. Never take it undiluted or use it on your skin, without a carrier oil 
1114 2018-09-03 21:22:40 yeah, i’m the guy doctors hate because of my one weird trick AMA
1115 2018-09-03 21:22:30 Agar ayyan Ali musalsal visit karay to honey and olive oil naguzeer ho jata hay javeria
1116 2018-09-03 21:22:27 Not a bot? That's embarrassing! So what excuse do you have for supporting the orange snake oil salesman?
1117 2018-09-03 21:22:22 If Albertan oilfield families can’t manage their money and are going broke they would do better to blame the past Harper government who was told 10 years ago oil wasn’t a sustainable industry but he kept banking on oil anyways
1118 2018-09-03 21:22:20 You would need at least ten people to move his body. Twenty if he put on baby oil.
1119 2018-09-03 21:22:14 @WhoseTrade I have a cool idea for the game so my cool idea is make pumps that pump up oil under ground and you have a barrle for this like a back pack then you can have a oil bearin that will buy the oil and other stuff like lava if you wanted.   Games cool btw
1120 2018-09-03 21:22:11 Cool! I quite fancy trying the 'meat'balls. Farm Foods do nice ones, but unfortunately they use palm oil.
1121 2018-09-03 21:22:11 My kit consists a roll of kitchen towel, Bore snakes of various calibres, a traditional set of cleaning rods and attachments, good quality oil sprays, oily rags, polishing cloths, a stiff tooth brush, a small stiff paint brush and a “bronze” suede brush.

1126 2018-09-03 21:21:11 Because it's in the Bible as a main ingredient of the Anointing oil and the incense. Cannabis in the Bible, look it up. It is established fact!###
That's why. A scientific study established this fact just before they criminalized weed. LOOK IT UP!
1127 2018-09-03 21:20:27 Fact I’m single says no lol an no, I’m too dirty (in the sense that I’m always covered in grease an oil all the time) nowhere near clean cut, havent shaved in about 4 years 
1128 2018-09-03 21:20:20 My wife has fibromyalgia and has been taking cbd oil for around 4 months. The only thing that helps. Ditched her prescribed medication as it wasn't helping.
1129 2018-09-03 21:20:02 Baby oil
1130 2018-09-03 21:19:59 Yes! Yves makes an outstanding pepperoni. It's good as is, but I miss the greasiness of real pepperoni, so I soak the slices in olive oil before using them.

1131 2018-09-03 21:19:27 @NikkiXX13XX It would be nice to see her feet tickle tortured for 1 hour, with brush and nails, with oil under her feet but without break, witout letting breathe and without safeword.
In this way (no breaks and no safeword) you will be literally tortured
1132 2018-09-03 21:19:15 Two drops of "oil of oregano" under your tongue. Yeah, you'll probably throw up but.. It will help!
1133 2018-09-03 21:19:10 It’s Hilarious-
Saudi Sheiks kick out ourEmbassy & Staff, pull all Investment in Canada, cancel thousands of their University students, Yet Ont & Que Ass Kiss Saudi’s please sell us oil.  Canada puts sections on Venezuela’s Killer Dictator yet Ont & Que still buy his oil. WTF

1138 2018-09-03 21:18:42 Kratom and CBD oil are the answer, both have saved my life and no more synthetics from big pharma.  I'm not stuck in a bed anymore and able to volunteer 3 days a week now.  We aren't cattle, or lab rats for profit.  God made these things for us and you guys banned them.
1139 2018-09-03 21:18:42 Now does he think that will move @realDonaldTrump @POTUS since Merkle is already getting their oil from Russia. So when Russia says my way or we will cut u off at the peak of winter. Never let your enemy have u over a barrel not the best for Germany citizens.

1143 2018-09-03 21:18:18 Ooh! Do you have a recipe you could point me to? I've made topical rubs for myself in the past, but never an edible oil.
1144 2018-09-03 21:18:16 This is just a fraction of the wood that I need to split yet. Total winter heating bill is just over $500. When we used oil it was $4,000 for the winter
1145 2018-09-03 21:18:14 Are they in the self checkout lines?  No?  What about the almost fully automated McDonald's?  No?  Sears?  No....  Renewable energy?  No, that would make you look bad for big oil.  What about coal?

1149 2018-09-03 21:17:52 Moldy bread, rancid oil, spoiled meat, lack of medicines, the slaughter of a house pet to feed the family; this is the true face of socialism. Every country that has fallen into socialism shows this same face. Socialists promise a utopia, but they deliver desperation & misery.
1150 2018-09-03 21:17:48 Interesting... The effects of the weakening rand and appreciating oil prices is quite evident as well.

1153 2018-09-03 21:17:08 Yea i just added some powdered sugar, vanilla and oil. And tbh when i make it again i would add even less because just the nut and chocolate taste is so good

1179 2018-09-03 21:12:37 I know, that you know- American investors have their hand$ in the refining, shipping & distribution, etc of oil. By forcing the US reliance on imported oil 45 is ensuring the Russian grip around our throats. Putin is banking on the permafrost melting.

1181 2018-09-03 21:12:14 Recent marine animal deaths along Fla coast were from toxic red tide from nutrient run off from farms. How are oil and gas industry attacking the marine animals?

1182 2018-09-03 21:11:53 And you get a lot of your *country's* wealth from oil. "Social democracy" is a thing that exists. And it's what most Nordic countries are. Sorry to burst your bubble, but you're not fully capitalist. Your gov't is the major stockholder in many vital private enterprises.

1186 2018-09-03 21:11:31 Nigeria's unenviable position should worry every patriot. Those who are responsible for this quagmire should never escape harsh judgement. A nation that has earned Trillions of Dollars in oil revenue should be prosperous and not poverty ridden.
1187 2018-09-03 21:11:28 Depends on how u see it... during GEJ era, crude oil prices went up, some of d govnors borrowed so much to fund projects n wen d economy crashed, dey couldn't sustain their debt servicing plan, so d FG deducted it from their allocations n gave them d rest.. leaving most wit notin

1189 2018-09-03 21:11:20 It is very sad to know that our neighbor's oil products passes through our country.
1190 2018-09-03 21:11:06 "Bad guy" is a bridge too far for me, unless it encompasses all capitalists. It's the capitalist way. Auto and oil companies make profits and the people absorb the costs of pollution and climate change, for example. Big pharma is the same.

I've heard that Iceland won't be using palm oil, which is great. I hope their soya is GM free.
1203 2018-09-03 21:09:28 It does not make any sense. When Rupee is weak the oil price will go up.
1204 2018-09-03 21:09:26 Hey Clay, those soldiers didn't die for our freedoms. They died because of a lie perpetrated by corrupt politicians and the CIA because they have oil and heroin interests in the Middle East. But you know, keep feeding into their bullshit.
1205 2018-09-03 21:09:24 Govt is not totally powerless against oil price hikes. In 2009, then President Arroyo asked the oil cartels to stop hiking prices or face penalties. The Big 3 blinked first. All presidents after her became eunuchs. Arroyo had brass balls.
1206 2018-09-03 21:09:07 Tom, [interesting chart as always] Gold's price action appears to have predicted a fall in the oil price which has not really arrived. Whilst the relationship is a rhyme do you think that is likely to be the next step for oil, or a missed step ?

1209 2018-09-03 21:08:41 repercussions of a fracking accident are hugely serious, from poisoned aquifers to cancer clusters. 

Air travel and space industries have incredible safety cultures. Fracking holds similar risks but the culture is cowboy, oil ‘n’ gas industry, frack it and fuck off.
1210 2018-09-03 21:08:36 Are olive oil and honey still Halal? If not, we can always revert back to Council of Islamic Ideology.
1211 2018-09-03 21:08:33 How many plastic items do you have in your house? We all rely on oil (and its byproducts) for WAY more than just for heating houses and driving cars. Weaning off it en masse isn't as simple as it seems.

A lot of renewable energy is also reliant on strip mining rare minerals...
1212 2018-09-03 21:08:29 Norwegian here: We have billions in oil money to spend on 6 million people. On top of being taxed like 50-65% (income tax 36%+, sales tax 25%, gas goes for $8/gallon, car tax $400/year, and so forth)

If they fucked up while taking that amount of money, we'd burn down parliament.

1215 2018-09-03 21:08:17 The industry is not irrational, it just requires higher oil prices than currently exist. Frack drilling activity should be much more reduced as only a few wells breakeven at these prices.

1249 2018-09-03 21:02:49 2/2 our “tar sands” are actually some of the most environmentally responsible oil on the planet and for better or worse, it is a major factor in our economy. For me the bigger question is why are we still not 100% supplying all of our own energy needs and providing more

1278 2018-09-03 21:00:07 I know, but when you see a small country with oil, like Norway,  messing up so badly it really makes you worry.
1279 2018-09-03 21:00:03 long ago I read a book on forms of governments vs the kind of economics they have. For instance a knowledge economy thrives best in Democracy, while a resource economy (oil, diamonds etc) thrives with a dictator. Education is part of that equation.

1306 2018-09-03 20:56:40 the salad dressing I’m putting on everything:

2 tbsp olive oil
2 tsp red wine vinegar
generous squeeze of djon mustard (about 1/2 tbsp)
Poppy seeds
1307 2018-09-03 20:56:18 For the sauce: instead of butter only, a mix of olive oil 2/3 and butter 1/3 . You can add crushed garlic

1312 2018-09-03 20:55:50 There are. I was out fishing off Port Renfrew yesterday and there was a huge oil tanker headed west.

1315 2018-09-03 20:55:45 We have enough money to pay for services with taxes rather than oil.  But whiny assholes, such as yourself, are always pushing for taxcuts. 

We also don't need to pay interest. We can borrow at 0 from the Bank of Canada.

1332 2018-09-03 20:53:14 Fittings vary so check!

I standardise on 8-32 thread. You need a rod, solid is best. Then brass wire brush, cotton mops and maybe a chamber brush in the same fitting. Get a dozen mops. Buy a quality nitro bore solvent and get a light gun oil for lubrication and protection.

1366 2018-09-03 20:48:34 You can also use lotion and give her fish oil to help with dry skin
1367 2018-09-03 20:48:30 I wouldn't mind trying it. I'm pretty happy with how coconut oil is treating it, though.
1368 2018-09-03 20:48:26 I smell like Hoppe’s No. 9 and gun oil...where all the saber dads at?!
1369 2018-09-03 20:48:22 Coconut oil FTW
1370 2018-09-03 20:48:22 We got everything to fry some fish except the oil 
1371 2018-09-03 20:48:19 We were working with oil lol
1372 2018-09-03 20:48:13 If you’re with me and I see you use a paper towel to dab the oil off your pizza just know the authorities are on the way
1373 2018-09-03 20:47:53 大事ですわ〜(´∀｀)って実感しました！

がぅさんのmてぃっちゃんて、OIL交換時期になるとOILが点滅しますか？(・ω・｀)
1374 2018-09-03 20:47:25 As the 16%VAT on oil is set in the markets, the ferry charges on vehicles crossing the likoni ferries will increase, 

the Lamu archipelago is highly affected as most commodities are crossed over by both solas and non-solas vessels thus a significant hike in common commodities.
1375 2018-09-03 20:46:41 This male prostitute @Kaepernick7 will do anything for money!
1376 2018-09-03 20:46:37 Jenn. I don’t think there were fish in there. The amount of times Liberty Belle would leak oil probably killed them all already
1377 2018-09-03 20:46:35 Business in Adamawa? You mean the chicken fast food joint and the University? That can barely sustain his lifestyle. He has a major interest in Intels-which is huge in the Oil & Gas industry. Am sure there are more. They are all crooks-no exception.
1378 2018-09-03 20:46:29 Sweetie, the UN has been prostituting themselves for ages for Arab Oil Dollars. The US knows this, even the president of the UN said it was biased. 
It is only natural that democracies would support each other against bigots.
1379 2018-09-03 20:46:10 My point is that our whole economy is tied to oil.  I work in engineering & risk management.
1380 2018-09-03 20:46:08 Today on Labor Day let us remember all who lost jobs in the oil sector because of our useless government.
1381 2018-09-03 20:46:08 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.
1382 2018-09-03 20:45:50 No. Its the most clogging oil out of all of the oils you typically put on your face.
1383 2018-09-03 20:45:49 Dear Sir, will this change IF a Conservative vote happens in 2019? Will Canada be able to tell the Saudis to keep their dirty oil because we're quite capable of producing our own clean oil, we have the technology???!
1384 2018-09-03 20:45:42 Try our new Cat Daddy Strawberry-bopped Sardine Spring Rolls. This beauty's crop-dusted by Tomato Anchovy Oil and served by Xzibit! Who doesn't love that!?
1385 2018-09-03 20:45:36 It ain’t about oil, and Fox News has always been fair and balanced.
1386 2018-09-03 20:45:34 Mayo, eggs, and olive oil. Added honey to my leave in conditioner. What do you use ?
1387 2018-09-03 20:45:34 Undrar vad man skulle göra om @carlbildt knackade på? 

"Hej, hur går det med Lundin oil?"
1388 2018-09-03 20:45:29 Sisley black rose mask, la mer exfoliating oil, Sisley deeply purifying mask, simple face wash, dr Brandt microdermabrasion (blue tube), la mer regenerating serum
1389 2018-09-03 20:45:06 Lol I don’t think I can miss ABU 
1390 2018-09-03 20:45:04 Is it just me or are the Braves and September like oil and water?
1391 2018-09-03 20:44:52 Take a typical white cake mix, take a 20oz can of pineapple juice in natural juice.  Sub apple sauce for the oil.  Add  eggs as box calls for. Don’t add water, the juice in the can is enough. Bake as directed but will take 10-15 minutes longer.
1392 2018-09-03 20:44:49 abi oil don fall hand? Abeg give us the gbedu maaaama
1393 2018-09-03 20:44:37 @AliVelshi Wtf, man? You guest talks about Canadian kids going to war for you and your response, which you couldn’t wait to get in is “speaking of every last drop of blood, let’s talk about oil and gas”. 
Low-class, man
1394 2018-09-03 20:44:36 I think it has a lot to do with not re-using oil. The chips are also evenly cut. But it isn't cheap, that's why it's of better quality.
1395 2018-09-03 20:44:34 I think it would make excellent braai kindling or oil absorbent.
1396 2018-09-03 20:44:24 Oil.. paçanın arkası uzun :))
1397 2018-09-03 20:44:06 I love hearing that sales for Oil, meat and Dairy are going down in the grand scheme of things.
1398 2018-09-03 20:43:59 If I break your heart.. Na oil spillage ooo.
1399 2018-09-03 20:43:50 فى أمان الله
1400 2018-09-03 20:43:49 If I died at this exact moment and an autopsy was performed, they’d find out that I’m made up of like 50% caffeine and 50% CBD oil cuz I don’t know how to balance my life lol
1401 2018-09-03 20:43:30 But as Anti-Terror Tools, the Oil & Gas Schemes may be unmatched in their effectiveness.
1402 2018-09-03 20:43:24 That’s very well executed in oil,JMW quality sky.
1403 2018-09-03 20:43:22 For healthy shiny hair use a hot oil treatment once a week.
1404 2018-09-03 20:43:22 get the Alberta Indians onside. They stand to benefit greatly from oil projects. Ottawa will listen to the Indians; they need to step up.
1405 2018-09-03 20:43:18 Good quality English lavender oil can be a great help through this traumatic few days.....
1406 2018-09-03 20:43:09 The rest of the world should've just lied to the Americans and said there was oil in the BETA hives. The war would've been over in a week.
1407 2018-09-03 20:42:47 Sell off Scottish Water to their chums in the city at a knockdown price 

Allow fracking anywhere the oil cos want without planning permission being required 

Abolish free uni tuition 
Abolish free prescriptions 
Bring back bridge tolls
Abolish free travel for over 60s

Day2....
1408 2018-09-03 20:42:44 The Oil & Gas Schemes...Exposed? Explained? Or Misunderstood? The Oil & Gas Schemes made America the World's Largest Energy Producer. As bad as the Currency Schemes, Oil & Gas Schemes are atrocious Financial Practices. They're Investments destined to blow up in everyone's faces.
1409 2018-09-03 20:42:25 It just occurred to me that, since it's an emulsifier (ex: the trick to getting oil and vinegar dressings to stay together), a little mustard powder is probably a good thing to add to stews and other dishes where you are shooting for a thick, rich sauce.
1410 2018-09-03 20:42:21 Sir, India is not populated by only fools much as you or your boss @PMOIndia would want. It’s Shameful you take credit for global events of fall in global oil prices and find SOMEONE TO BLAME for all that you do wrong. If you are so confident have a white paper on demonetization
1411 2018-09-03 20:42:19 Any time I eat Chic Fil A, I pray because I know that might be my last meal  knowing damn well I’m allergic to that damn peanut oil and my lips/tongue bouta swell smh
1412 2018-09-03 20:42:14 My belief is that this isn't a anti oil campaign it's an anti Alberta campaign with Trudeau leading the charge.
1413 2018-09-03 20:42:10 kwani huwa unajipaka sabuni ama mafuta? Alafu unapika mboga na cream (butter) ya maziwa bila cooking oil
1414 2018-09-03 20:41:48 Booooo 
1415 2018-09-03 20:41:47 I chose this year to use avocado and light olive oil.  My preferred herbs were - Rosemary, Thyme, Oregano,  Peppercorns, Garlic and Chives.
1416 2018-09-03 20:41:33 i'm going to oil my scalp either tonight or in the morning
1417 2018-09-03 20:41:31 Wrapped up potatoes with onions, fresh garlic, and olive oil in foil packets for the grill.
1418 2018-09-03 20:41:07 abaa!pipo wit clear plan to be oil workers now found themselves as yellow fever.
1419 2018-09-03 20:41:05 Ijs about the beard  now use grape seed oil too . Thank me later 
1420 2018-09-03 20:40:43 Correct. At one point, that cash was a major contributor to their economy, not too far behind oil.
1421 2018-09-03 20:40:27 あ！何かガスマスクつけた白い鳥がいるぞ！待てー！
1422 2018-09-03 20:40:19 Accidentally got pepper oil in my nostril and now I know what burning to death feels like.
1423 2018-09-03 20:40:07 バターとかマーガリンとか知らないけど多分吸ったぜ。
1424 2018-09-03 20:40:03 Can I oil your engine ☻
1425 2018-09-03 20:40:00 You’re right, that’s why i said it will be “tricky.” We need to innovate and diversify rapidly. Oil is not the only thing.
1426 2018-09-03 20:39:57 Any Mega Corrupt Want Bail ? Come to Karachi & Get In 20 Lakhs Under taking . Any Prisner Want Hospitalise Get Medical Certificate by Naveed Qamar Brother in NICVD he is Director . Any one like Glenphenic Whisky Become Honey or Olive Oil . Its Pee Pee Pee (PPP) Govt: here

1430 2018-09-03 20:39:19 Cassava and oil is a salad
1431 2018-09-03 20:39:16 I was inspired to bake Bristol Biscuits on last week's #gbbo regional bakes. Needed cassia oil, hello Amazon. Only bl**dy ordered massage oil, not edible oil! #fail #bakingfail

The replacement won't be here til Wednesday - I'm behind on the weekly #bakealong already! 
1432 2018-09-03 20:38:57 Oh my. I wonder if since it ran out of oil, it ended up getting blocked with junk?
1433 2018-09-03 20:38:57 This is great news for companies like mine who specialise in helping oil & gas companies transition their assets, once an SPA has been signed!
1434 2018-09-03 20:38:55 Baba Rehmty "Trap" mei aagaya, yaar loogon ne jaan boojh ker Sharaab ke bottles mei Honey & Olive Oil rakh k Sharaab ke "Mukhbari" ke aur Baba Rehmty Josh e Dushmani e PPP mei Dhawa bol deya
1435 2018-09-03 20:38:55 Yep, disgustingly light sentence.

Our justice system is not just.

@72Hallam is facing 18yrs in prison for giving genuinely sick people free #Cannabis oil -

This sick multiple kiddie fiddler gets a slap.

Who the hell are our laws and politicians protecting (and why)?

1436 2018-09-03 20:38:52 Ali bhai i thought Diya jalaye rakhna tha?? 

Yeh toa load shedding k baad oil walay diye b bhuja rahay hain.
1437 2018-09-03 20:38:46 Left-wing control of information and tech companies is a HUGE threat to freedom and our nation. Break them up like Ma Bell or Standard Oil.
1438 2018-09-03 20:38:45 Was thinking of doing oil painting but theres so much that needed to be done when doing so that even wrong disposal of solvents can send you to jail smh
1439 2018-09-03 20:38:45 Roasted beanssss. Chickpeas or navy beans, rinsed and patted dry. Little spray oil and spices, in the oven at 425 for like 20 min shaking halfway through. Crispy and tasty!!!
1440 2018-09-03 20:38:44 Finally convinced my dad to let ME do my oil change instead of just watching and holding the light, and now I'm super proud of myself
1441 2018-09-03 20:38:42 So my question is, how can you counter their agenda before you even know what the roots of it are? He actually represents a VERY scary majority of special interests that overlap the Israeli/Zionist lobby, oil/energy sector & military industrial complex. Virtually unstoppable
1442 2018-09-03 20:38:36 You’re a liar and a snake oil salesman. Does anyone believe anything you have to say?
1443 2018-09-03 20:38:27 So funny to read replies, as if some of you didn’t use oil products 
1444 2018-09-03 20:38:21 the US brought “democracy” to Libya because Libya announced they would no longer use dollars for oil....
1445 2018-09-03 20:37:51 A good diet is a balanced diet. Take me for example, I eat a leaf of kale to justify drinking fryer oil.
1446 2018-09-03 20:37:39 Good. India will adjust oil supplier per INDIA's wish, not Trump or anyone else!

Next, finalize S-400 purchase!
1447 2018-09-03 20:37:25 Que linda forma de desmostrar tu amor pidiendome cada dos por tres que te descargue videos
1448 2018-09-03 20:37:13 This is what happens when you run your race. @TerryMcMillen and that team did just that giving themselves a chance to win. Amazing day for the Amalie Oil Top Fuel dragster. That's two career wins and is now a  #USNats champion #History #NHRA
1449 2018-09-03 20:36:55 The VAT is based on the cost of fuel! The oil prices in the world have been low, the questions we ought to ask is what the logic used by ERC to set the current prices! ERC is the problem here, ERC is the main cartle thats hurting kenyans!
1450 2018-09-03 20:36:55 Was genuinely curious what she was doing. 
Didnt learn a thing.
1451 2018-09-03 20:36:54 I was thinking of a garlic-chili oil with extra paprika, then you get it in the bag and shake until everything's got some

kinda basing it off chinese hot oil but with some additions, if you've ever had or made that - tastes fucking phenomenal; also actual murder weapon
1452 2018-09-03 20:36:36 When ya buy a fancy new evening face oil & suddenly the whole khandan wants a facial  that cost me uno 
1453 2018-09-03 20:36:32 Yeah see dead was bad enough. I'd have set the bed on fire while "Beds Are Burning" by Midnight Oil played in the background.
1454 2018-09-03 20:36:18 Hmm so my car says it’s 5k over for an oil change.... hopefully I don’t blow up.
1455 2018-09-03 20:36:11 Why the fuck are we there? Leave and stop killing our sons and daughters for a war that will rage on forever! They don’t want to see it end why do we?? Oh shit I forgot money and oil well my kids are better than that and America wake up yours are too!!!!!!
1456 2018-09-03 20:35:59 Rock and oil*
1457 2018-09-03 20:35:57 Eating out in Boston is like trying to learn how to eat things that don’t ever belong on a dinner plate. Fuck your truffle oil glazed tree root coleslaw stuffed potstickers and put some god damn pork in there before I have an aneurism.
1458 2018-09-03 20:35:54 green tea, sugar & honey, or coconut oil, sugar & lemon* (if your skin isn’t sensitive), or just add sugar to whatever you’re already using! Invest in a rotating facial brush if you can - makes a Huge difference
1459 2018-09-03 20:35:47 Well, electric cars are still in their infancy. There's alot of innovation that needs to be done but to shift our dependency out of oil would be a huge task to stop the greed going on in the middle East with oil. The less we depend on oil, the better.
1460 2018-09-03 20:35:42 I bet you "Really Care". Like with the climate change hoax that drives away billions in investments from the oil and gas industry of Canada into US. Your favourite Enemy #1 Trump is very happy ...
1461 2018-09-03 20:35:32 I rubbed myself with Cypriot olive oil today.
1462 2018-09-03 20:35:28 Mamma says no sports bike...Modi Ji agrees ! #PetrolPriceHike Btw..did anyone care to check what the crude oil price was 4 years prior to today ? Why this hike ? #PetrolPrice #PetrolPrice #sportsbike
1463 2018-09-03 20:35:25 wild growth is the best oil
1464 2018-09-03 20:35:09 Sa någon Lundin Oil? 
1465 2018-09-03 20:34:48 Double entendres
1466 2018-09-03 20:34:30 If we were to build some combination of Trans Mountain, Northern Gateway and Energy East, we would have no further need to sell our oil to anyone at bargain basement prices. Canada has almost as much oil as Saudi Arabia and only 36 million people to share the wealth..
1467 2018-09-03 20:34:29 Today is the day I learned you have to put synthetic oil in a hybrid.
1468 2018-09-03 20:34:29 We need to increase funding for Planned Weaponhood

1473 2018-09-03 20:34:10 Yes, exactly, but we contemporary people sometimes forget that eating hinges even more on food than on oil. Without stable growing conditions and sufficient, uncontaminated water, no food to transport.
1474 2018-09-03 20:33:48 Torso like a barrel of crude oil painted green.
1475 2018-09-03 20:33:43 Not if we do something about it...like starting to built our Military force to be independent from U.S....also, exporting our Oil on the international sector (EXCLUDING CHINA) and stopping outside foreign buyers for our housing market AND all illegal immigrant NOW!
1476 2018-09-03 20:33:41 I see you can't face constructive criticism, neither can you condone it,nor can you distinguish between ramblings and savage.
1477 2018-09-03 20:33:36 اكيد
1478 2018-09-03 20:33:03 First thing first. 80 percent of oil and natural gas to the states is from Canada. Secondly USA can’t not meet the supply for lumber needed so yet again Canada comes to the rescue. Thirdly water? Canada has the most of it in the world.
1479 2018-09-03 20:32:57 No fueron dos veces??
1480 2018-09-03 20:32:51 Boyfriend has just walked all the way down to Asda old Kent road to get me some oil of clove for my terrible toothache comes all the way back and the bottle is empty but sealed! @asda @AsdaServiceTeam  fuming and still in pain!!
1481 2018-09-03 20:32:45 @realDonaldTrump Oil and banking sanctions are more important to us than anything, I hope your government will feel responsible and we do not have to repeat this. Exemptions should be removed from the sanctions system and Iran's oil exports should reach zero by November 4.
1482 2018-09-03 20:32:43 Inn bechaaron ko aur koi bottle muyassar nhi thi jo Alcohol ki bottle me shaihad aur olive oil bhar lya, haraam bottle me paak aur halal shaihad aur olive oil
1483 2018-09-03 20:32:41 Is “oil on the stairs” code for you were drinking wine? I’m not sure.
1484 2018-09-03 20:32:29 He really did good
1485 2018-09-03 20:32:15 This debate is premised on resources being finite or scarce. Neither of which are true, except to the extent man applies himself in discovering new ways to sustain his existence. If oil is the end all, then the end of oil creates the illusion of scarcity. All that ever was, exist
1486 2018-09-03 20:32:05 Well, there go their sales!
1487 2018-09-03 20:32:01 I needed an oil change 3,000 miles ago. Someone fight me 
1488 2018-09-03 20:31:55 Its thanks to snake oil salesmen like this fella that we’re all in the Brexit sh1t. Don’t forget it.
1489 2018-09-03 20:31:51 Re-established Dodd Frank consumer protections, curbed predatory lending practices, forced oil companies to drill or loose the lease made us less dependent on foreign oil, drove down gas prices, if you have investments that dropped in '05-'07 you know... Out of characters
1490 2018-09-03 20:31:50 VALEN AGARRATELO Y SEAS PENDEJA COMO YO QUE NO HICE NADA
1491 2018-09-03 20:31:42 I love peppermint oil for allergies, nausea and headaches.
1492 2018-09-03 20:31:38 To be fair the AI academics here know another AI winter is coming. The skunks in industry are harder to pin down. Is anyone really buying their snake oil or are they just experimenting with it in house?  I think the buy out folks are getting rich but who else is profiting?
1493 2018-09-03 20:31:22 But your orange friend wants to drill oil.

1497 2018-09-03 20:31:11 @spanishcvndy what hair oil do you use?
1498 2018-09-03 20:31:04 A healthy solid oil industry is absolutely 100% essential in -40 Saskatchewan in January. End of discussion.
1499 2018-09-03 20:31:00 All I’m saying is today I’ve seen: low rates = easy money; Fed caused fracking; neofisherian theories based on oil; Austrian theories based on oil; and more topics which we have beat to a bloody pulp on here.

1505 2018-09-03 20:30:15 @aniedi_ibok a memory just popped into my head where you were asking Ima how to boil spaghetti so it doesn’t stick. Lol so maybe you need to be reminded now. Wait for the water to boil, put in some oil and then put in the spaghetti .
1506 2018-09-03 20:30:06 Do you drink coffee, do you buy your veggies, did you use oil for your car?do you use a mobile phone,  computer or car? If you answered yes why are you asking a food provider about his land use. All the above damage the environment so be honest in your answer?
1507 2018-09-03 20:30:05 Cool, I got a dropper thing with oil from the chemist. I currently have an ear full of oil....
1508 2018-09-03 20:30:05 Rneelmani, petrol is going up all over the world and in fact 25/30% more than india and the prices change every day, unfortunately up. It is dependent on the US Dollar as well as the problems in the oil producing countries. US being a major oil producer wants prices to shoot up
1509 2018-09-03 20:30:04 Según los chavistas en Venezuela hay 6millones de colombianos y de millón en millón de peruanos ecuatorianos chileno portugueses italianos españoles chinos y demás suman 40 millones y nadie es finalmente venezolano
1510 2018-09-03 20:29:56 pay down debt is key to an untapped oil reserve around the Caribbean regions; T&T, Venezuela, Barbados, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Jamaica to name a few. cleanup your books to keep control otherwise foreign entities will export every $ back to their overseas Banks @justtrini1
1511 2018-09-03 20:29:49 You are going against Snake oil Taggart.  You have a garuntee.
1512 2018-09-03 20:29:46 Broken? Broken by whom? The US? Or, the first country attacked Libya, who operates %35 of oil reserves of the country now after Qaddafi was taken out, France. You  provoke wars in those countries, then 
Europe struggles with unprecedented migrant flux and against terrorism.

1514 2018-09-03 20:29:17 Every successful economy is a mixture of capitalism & socialism. It's good to check what we as a society are subsidizing on a regular basis. Do we still need to pay for (examples) oil and corn? Are these consistent with our values? Why wouldn't we want energy independence? #solar
1515 2018-09-03 20:29:14 That'll be the time when the countries working class got a fairer share of the pie when the country had real industries. Then we had the opec oil crisis & shit management that fought hard to take away hard won workers rights. Thatcher saw to it that the rich won that war
1516 2018-09-03 20:28:57 Finally got Tyler some castor oil. Idk where my original bottle went, smh. I’m annoyed.

1520 2018-09-03 20:28:32 If conservatives do this, where is the logic in propping up the oil gas and coal industries?
1521 2018-09-03 20:28:30 When canola oil companies funding researchers for impartial “scientific” studies, the coconut oil becomes poisonous. “Avocados are bad for health while corn flakes are the top nutrition” preaches the carboholic evangelist!
1522 2018-09-03 20:28:28 Good question! Back in 2013 was skeptical if/when oil/LNG projects would happen + impact on shipping. NSR has entered new phase. Yamal, Novy Port, etc. bring steady+rapid traffic increase. COSCO quite active. Definitely surpasses my expectations from 3-4y ago. 20m tons by 2020.

1531 2018-09-03 20:28:00 Not gonna say just how long it's taken me to figure out that I can just put the CBD oil on my cat's back instead of fighting to get it into her mouth. She's quite happily cleaning it off her fur now.

1538 2018-09-03 20:27:19 The USA will always have a large trade deficit because it is a huge consumer .. an example is oil .. the USA producers a little more than 10% of world oil but uses 20% of oil .. things are changing for oil but it’s just an example ...
1539 2018-09-03 20:27:18 @BizNasty2point0 is there a link you have for this CBD oil you’re pitching?

1560 2018-09-03 20:24:16 So do you think the uniformity of wine and oil amphorae led to one amphora being an accepted unit of volume for measuring things other than wine or oil? So the amphora came first simply as a means of quantifying and selling liquid but then went into common use as a measure?
1561 2018-09-03 20:24:11 Agree. Annoying flippers but share price holding up well. Just need news to drop for R1/R2 oil and volume will move this up to 16p #aaog

1634 2018-09-03 20:14:45 Wrong. The oil price only quickened the collapse. The truth is that oil was being used to import food after local production dried up due to nationalisation. When the money ran out, boom!
1635 2018-09-03 20:14:38 Worked as a mechanic during HS in my cousin’s shop. However, I had no knowledge about cars and he wouldn’t teach me. Took me a while before long, I began doing oil changes like normal.

1637 2018-09-03 20:14:38 I've been doing a lot of research (worldwilde), during my Masters in International Business Administration / Gas and Oil Management. In this way, I thoroughly knew the two sides of the coin, and I had access to information enough to make my choices. Fortunately, all green.
1638 2018-09-03 20:14:31 Trump also is not selling US out to Canada which has used us especially in oil and gas and exporting engineers here to take jobs
1639 2018-09-03 20:14:17 Yeah that’s disgusting, why would someone pour honey & olive oil outta their original bottles to liquor bottles? Like why?
1640 2018-09-03 20:14:11 In addition, may I recommend you sleep in a tent (btw made with oil biproducts) during the winter. See how that works for you. Or perhaps stay in your home which is made, littered and surrounded with stuff made with oil products. Just make sure you don' turn your heat on!!!
1641 2018-09-03 20:13:59 Divans, the are softer than a couch.

1645 2018-09-03 20:13:33 The stench of BP began with the 2007 oil spill on AK's North Slope near Prudhoe Bay —the details of which BP demanded a gag order & failed to squelch reports to Fed agencies. BP paid $19M in criminals & restitution fines.
1646 2018-09-03 20:13:06 Up oil spills.
1647 2018-09-03 20:13:04 Or general? Or forte oil? Or oando? Or total? Or petrocam? Or BIS?
1648 2018-09-03 20:12:52 Peppermint oil extract mixed with water sprayed around all door and window frames. They hate it.
1649 2018-09-03 20:12:52 I believe I am right in saying generator sellers, the fuel/diesel/oil marketers etc all have a hand in the epilipetic power supply. How else will they afford regular first class tickets abroad, private jets, bribing their puppets- government etc....simple, make the masses suffer
1650 2018-09-03 20:12:50 Looks like oil in water
1651 2018-09-03 20:12:48 @seanhannity CIRI in Alaska shareholders need a voice. CEO & Board wont let us sell shares. Devalued our oil & gas rich lands, sold it, wont tell us to who, our votes are only advisory now. CEO & Board pay themselves millions, corrupt as can be.  Please call me 206-851-6420
1652 2018-09-03 20:12:45 @FullOfShitTrey Can you come give me an oil change this weekend and check my tires 
1653 2018-09-03 20:12:39 I remember when they boiled people alive in oil who behaved like this.
1654 2018-09-03 20:12:30 Gamora could simply have jumped in the pool and came straight back out, but while she was there she swam several lengths of the pool, treating it as an additional workout. 

Slender digits coiled around the metal handrails while she used the steps to exit the pool. 

The oil >
1655 2018-09-03 20:12:23 Kid at Jiffy Lube dropped mine into a can of oil and I must admit, I enjoyed that they had to replace it with a new one, because I know what those goddamn things cost.
1656 2018-09-03 20:12:23 As a white person, I disagree. The same people who portrayed President Obama as a monkey and Mrs. Obama as “an ape in heels” elected trump, together with those too dumb to recognize a snake oil salesman.

1659 2018-09-03 20:12:01 And where does one buy Elmswood honey olive oil etc?
1660 2018-09-03 20:11:57 Venison carpaccio. Freeze raw venison, slice it VERY thinly. Marinate in olive oil and woody herbs (thyme, rosemary) for 24 hours.
1661 2018-09-03 20:11:52 So i smoked for the 3rd time now and still didn’t get high poor me, same with the oil and tea
1662 2018-09-03 20:11:51 3. MIND Diet
Healthy eating, particularly more dark colored  fruit, vegetables and oily fish has been shown to improve memory and  stave off cognitive decline. It consists of  Lots of vegetables, leafy greens, nuts, berries, beans, fish, poultry, olive oil, whole grains and wine.
1663 2018-09-03 20:11:51 Scary really.   Presumably he understands the truth about this.  It's a rallying call to the ignorant by a snake oil salesman.
1664 2018-09-03 20:11:50 Luck has nothing to do with it... you're just an excellent Snake Oil Salesman, Mr President. But when the people finally realize what you really are you'll be run out of town on a rail. Just like Flim-Flam-Men were punished in the past. #DishonestDonald

My dream is to see @Chessie_kay (@ChessieKay  )a 1 hour tickle torture video with brush and nails,with oil under her feet but without break, without letting breathe and without safeword. In this way (no breaks and no safeworld)Chessie will be literally tickle tortured
1666 2018-09-03 20:11:42 from the outset of his admin Buhari, in his capacity as petroleum minister, has never uttered a word about the PIB, or its unbundled elements. This could be blamed on a no of factors: The first is the absence of mental wherewithal to understand the need for oil & gas reforms.
1667 2018-09-03 20:11:39 Those @Shell #recharge points are very good value at 0.25 p kWh and reliable. I could think of a few other companies that could use them as an example. Cough cough @ElecHighway. I’d never thought I’d be heaping praise on an oil company. #EV @BMWi @The_PlugSeeker @evopinion
1668 2018-09-03 20:11:34 Thanks Amanda!  I'm getting the hang of using the oil brush.
1669 2018-09-03 20:11:27 Before I started meds my therapist recommended CBD oil. I’d look into that!! I don’t know much about it but I know it’s totally legal in WI and can be found at natural food stores sometimes
1670 2018-09-03 20:11:24 Capitalism has no soul. It is innately immoral. It's only purpose is to minimize costs and maximize profits. Example: Oil companies. Exon Valdez destruction of Prince William Sound. BP destruction of Gulf of Mexico. Oil companies fighting daily to loosen & lighten regulations

sorry guys i can't trust on that report it was "honey"
1673 2018-09-03 20:10:55 oil pan, youre done. oh im about to take a sloppy sloppy oil shower
1674 2018-09-03 20:10:55 Eeks poison ivy - yes that oil gets on everything based on some past experiences: Gardening gloves, long sleeves,  jeans, in the smoke when burning leaves.  Hopefully the leashes also were washed - hope it’s not too bad for your hoomum
1675 2018-09-03 20:10:50 You know I bet oil rigs could be retrofitted for uranium seawater extraction too.
1676 2018-09-03 20:10:47 People are really out here CURING their diagnosed TERMINAL CANCER with specially blended THC & CBD oil and people are still being drained to death on meds and chemo!! I hate this fucking world
1677 2018-09-03 20:10:44 I think you need to looked up world trade. Remember Saudi arabia for oil. Israel in the middle of a dessert were able to get water through desalination and lumber, have you ever visited Oregon ? Thanks to President Trump we are now the largest producer of oil.

1683 2018-09-03 20:10:02 Did U know that although it is called “oil,” #coconut oil is a solid fat, like butter. If you eat it, use virgin not refined.
1684 2018-09-03 20:09:59 Smelling peppermint oil might work 
1685 2018-09-03 20:09:59 I wonder what her real agenda is? What’s the actual career move because is just smoke and mirrors and snake oil stuff

1688 2018-09-03 20:09:41 It amazes me how talking on the phone is a skill that has been lost. I just called to make an appointment to get my oil changed and the woman mumbled, didn’t sound friendly, and didn’t say bye. If it’s your job to answer a phone, know what you’re doing.
1689 2018-09-03 20:09:40 i roasted them yesterday, and the salt didnt stick. I assume i need to bake with some kind of oil... am i in the right direction?
1690 2018-09-03 20:09:32 Like “denier” it is pejorative term intentionally used denigrate our oil fields and oil field workers.  Like racism, the insult is implicit when used by the privelaged class who hate blue collar America and the ability to make a living pulling energy out of the ground
1691 2018-09-03 20:09:11 Also deep conditioned my hair in coconut oil, gymmed and managed to get some studying done. Is this what growth feels like?
1692 2018-09-03 20:09:10 @realDonaldTrump . @POTUS Will you consider helping CIRI in Alaska shareholders. We can't get help from the normal routes.  CEO & Board won't let us sell our shares.  They are have devalued our lands NOL's sold and wont tell us anything.  Oil is open on our lands. We need you!
1693 2018-09-03 20:08:57 Lol. That's savage
1694 2018-09-03 20:08:43 Oh precious darling, but he seems to be healing up really nicely.  Does he have pain killers.  It's a helluva an operation, all the liver area and stuff.  He will be alright x
1695 2018-09-03 20:08:38 May God bless your dog. My dog loves to watch dogs on tv. The agility comp that was on 2 wks ago had her so excited.when the dogs leaped into the water she flew off my couch going after the frisbee.
Have they done research w dogs using cdb oil like kids?
1696 2018-09-03 20:08:30 It’s so bad that I’m finally getting an oil diffuser, which I should of done months ago
1697 2018-09-03 20:08:27 If CJ of supreme Court will ask the investigation he was giving Honey & Olive Oil for his health by force  in inquiry this is tregdy of Pakistan even this Poor old will say itself in front of CJ
1698 2018-09-03 20:08:23 This OIL cost me plenty! 
It's priceless. 
Thank YOU God. <3 Singing: "Never would have made it."

1699 2018-09-03 20:08:11 LOL! Got it 100% backward: Life as we live it cannot survive burning oil
1700 2018-09-03 20:08:10 And was the UK protected or otherwise by having sterling being used as a peg by various Commonwealth countries? If you go five years either side of 1971, the thing that killed UK GDP growth was 1973's oil crisis leading into a continuing budget crisis in the UK in 1974.
1701 2018-09-03 20:08:06 Also, two of the greatest food stuffs on Earth - garlic & ginger. Mince about equal parts enough to make a heaping tablespoon and fry them for a minute or two in oil before you add meat or vegetables to the pan.
1702 2018-09-03 20:07:58 Both parts of it, the tire, oil, and car companies colluding to get rid of it plus the city government's inaction on improving the system to focus on freeways, led to its demise.
1703 2018-09-03 20:07:47 Pls Edward just forget it... never reply back.. no matter what he’s gonna say!! Let go of it! If could remember he had to call me stupid.., calling the learned ppl like us stupid and useless. Most of us have d certificate that even his presdo is lacking

1706 2018-09-03 20:06:56 I think that the olive oil that comes from olives that weren’t smashed is virgin olive oil
1707 2018-09-03 20:06:54 The reality seems to be the only thing Libya is good at is exporting  #oil... with nothing to show for it.

1708 2018-09-03 20:06:52 Data is new oil.
1709 2018-09-03 20:06:29 Do we gotta provide the oil?
1710 2018-09-03 20:06:20 Know a few Mensa members, had a hard time changing the oil in their car and one didn't know how to get his spare tire off and then put it on his jeep. So... yeah. Wooo
1711 2018-09-03 20:06:15 dilemna: my skin is so much nicer right after washing rosehip oil away BUT is bad again if i dont keep using rosehip oil. 

but i never get to enjoy the good skin when i have to put rosehip oil on to get it nice
1712 2018-09-03 20:06:11 Oil. Moi aussi
1713 2018-09-03 20:06:08 Anyone remember Carter's WH address when he announced that the world was about our of oil?

1716 2018-09-03 20:05:40 cryptocurrencies are the silent wealth shift that will impact our generation hope you have your gold picks and oil rigs ready. just a heads up . Bitcoin rised up around 14 milion percent since 2009. that means 100 bucks invested then would have garnered 14,600,000 at its high.
1717 2018-09-03 20:05:20 Simple cleansing oil
1718 2018-09-03 20:05:20 It is not about human rights at this point. No time for that. All oil nations must wind down production ASAP.
1719 2018-09-03 20:04:58 got a job at an oil company where a bowtie is part of the uniform, you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain
1720 2018-09-03 20:04:54 Wish I had written that tweet BEFORE replacing the battery. I see there’s also an oil change coupon in there, so maybe I’ll see you for that 
1721 2018-09-03 20:04:40 Oil balancing best sgt! My skin type oily/acne prone. Cepat absorb nd muka pn jadi kurang berminyak 
1722 2018-09-03 20:04:13 They assume Rand strengthening and oil at a static price.
Only way it works.
It’s like putting all chips on red.

1724 2018-09-03 20:04:05 L.O.C. method. 
Once a week I wash my hair with shampoo or conditioner. 
Then apply oil while it's still wet.
Then two strand twist it with whatever hair creme I'm experimenting with at the time .
I ONLY comb/brush my hair when it's wet with a paddle brush.
1725 2018-09-03 20:04:04 Ring your oil supplier.They will help.This is not work for an amateur, too easy to spill oil.  You have my sympathy.
1726 2018-09-03 20:03:59 Vivian Krause has written about this in the Financial Post. A conspiracy to keep our oil out of the world market by any means possible sounds like Capitalism at its worst which means Capitalism as usual.
FN motives do not fit that scenario in U.S or here.
1727 2018-09-03 20:03:55 Just watching MOTD2, fine performance from Cathcart for Watford. And that fine managerial judge of talent Mr Paul Ince reckoned that Gary McKenzie, with the turning circle of an oil tanker, was a better player !
1728 2018-09-03 20:03:51 ¡Está buenísimo!
1729 2018-09-03 20:03:37 Still don't agree. I put a system in for under 2000 for a client. It works in tandem with what they had(oil) heats ALL water in summer, supplies rads and UFH in winter with boiler and wood burner. That is a massive saving on fuel. Some firms would have replaced boiler for 5000.
1730 2018-09-03 20:03:36 Doesn't this illustrate how broken the system is?
The shocking amount of money used to oil the mechanism and/or line representatives pockets could definitely be put to much better use
1731 2018-09-03 20:03:26 Burning my nose off with Olbas oil was not a good idea
1732 2018-09-03 20:03:22 They’re being carried away by religious and tribal differences !! Which is too bad! Most of them only love buhari cos he’s from their tribe and religion.., don’t be such a conservative kind of people. Expose yourself beyond religious and tribal lines
1733 2018-09-03 20:03:15 First, Moses picks the only spot for hundreds of miles around that doesn’t have “oil” and now this ?
1734 2018-09-03 20:03:06 Filling in 2-6p on @CKNW this afternoon. Back-to-school with @Kambolis — oil on trains with @TristinHopper — real estate with @SteveSaretsky ... we take you to #RiodeJaneiro for the latest on the Nat’l Museum #fire. #packed

1736 2018-09-03 20:02:55 Hi Danielle, I know, I’ve used the shellac primer before, it is excellent stuff. Looking forward to using the oil based prime all this week. Thanks 
1737 2018-09-03 20:02:54 Interesting correlation between North Sea Oil being discovered in 1969 & Aberdeen’s finest moments happening around a decade + later too.

Reminds me of another club.
1738 2018-09-03 20:02:41 I got an awesome coloring book page of Lara Croft from my pledge to @InnaVjuzhanina Patreon. I’m doing it up in grayscale oil paint on my iPad. I like it so far. 
Hope it cools down there
1739 2018-09-03 20:02:30 My president kindly save ordinary students from humble background travelling to school, please keep oil prices at breast,thank you sir
1740 2018-09-03 20:02:06 I visited Mobil at Ibeno years back and I wept. Gas that Arab nations are converting to billions of dollars, we are wasting it into the atmosphere then the oil companies pay a fine to the government for causing damage to the ecosystem. Are we not mad in this country?
1741 2018-09-03 20:01:59 When your mechanic is all mushy because his wife is named Laura and he "loves her so much" and you're like bro I just want an oil change like good for you but I'm not trying to be here for long
1742 2018-09-03 20:01:58 "The interview took place at a conference organized by the Israel Television News Company, where Lewinsky delivered a speech."
About what? An activist and speaker , for what? 
Fairly lazy reporting and generally a worthless article.

1746 2018-09-03 20:01:29 Expected to spend $50 on an oil change... ending up spending $160 
1747 2018-09-03 20:01:28 و لاكن الإيمان يزيد و ينقص من حال إلى حال
1748 2018-09-03 20:01:19 You're right, "Remain" would be far better for us as a trading nation as opposed to an oil rich one, but EEA\EFTA is still the least damaging Brexit option.
1749 2018-09-03 20:01:09 I need to stop slacking tho, I use go but raw coconut oil in my hair all the time. That's the reason it was so nice.
1750 2018-09-03 20:01:09 I just pray the world doesn’t run out of Cacay oil I will crumble
1751 2018-09-03 20:01:08 On the way to check became Honey & Olive Oil as per report they r Rulling since last 30 years their hidden agents r every where
1752 2018-09-03 20:01:00 Amazing how lefties are so happy at loss of jobs, oil jobs, auto jobs, & only certain media jobs.
1753 2018-09-03 20:00:58 I’m going home in 3 days and I am not ready. Like seriously, I haven’t packed anything, haven’t changed the oil in my car and I am not emotionally prepared for the excitement of seeing all my family.
1754 2018-09-03 20:00:50 So on target I want to see the end of oil based economy let’s build roads that can convert the weight of cars and trucks to electricity and have charging lanes
1755 2018-09-03 20:00:47 Why can India not create and flourish in non-US non-USD economy? Buy oil from Iran, pay in Euro,  ban AMERICAN companies?
1756 2018-09-03 20:00:43 Today I:

1760 2018-09-03 20:00:23 You're more worried about originality? Most are more worried about the state of affairs of our country. Our economy is being eviscerated. Maybe do away with all the crayons & everything else made with oil products. Your poor students will have nothing to learn with.

1764 2018-09-03 19:59:27 Louisiana ?  ; )  ; )  Even "East" TX was littered with 'oil derricks' when I grew up there. Midland is nothing but about oil.
1765 2018-09-03 19:59:18 And I’m high off Cannabis oil
1766 2018-09-03 19:59:17 CBD oil has been helpful for a lot of dogs with seizure like episodes
1767 2018-09-03 19:59:01 I hear you but wouldn’t you prefer a pipeline rather than oil being transported by rail? I would and many others would agree.
1768 2018-09-03 19:59:00 We love shaking tables. we don’t care whatever you got to say.., if you like what we write. That’s your choice. If you don’t like it. That’s your choice too ! We on twitter streets don’t damn care! I just pray that next time you would learn to mind your bsnss @oil_shaeikh
1769 2018-09-03 19:58:53 Yall gotta try pictsweetfarms vegetables.. only takes 20mins. Add oil, salt and pepper. Delicious healthy meal. #Gotitfree #pictsweetfarms #Letsroast #Roastemup
1770 2018-09-03 19:58:40 First Nations people still use oil, and now they'll pay higher prices with the rest of us. 

We'll also be shipping it more by train now, which is much worse for the environment 
1771 2018-09-03 19:58:37 While eliminating some safety procedures for miners, oil rig workers and meat processing workers.
1772 2018-09-03 19:58:36 2. The effect of rising crude oil prices in the global market has also contributed to the weakening of the Indian Rupee which sank to Rs 71 per US dollar days ago.
1773 2018-09-03 19:58:20 Blitzing up any leftover beans not used (after soaking) into dips with some oil, tahini and spices. White beans work especially well. #carrots #celery #zerowasteweek #ethicalhour
1774 2018-09-03 19:58:14 It's only shows how sick your brain thinks. Of all things it's fraud that came to it?  Smh. So you mean all handles that was suspended were all fraud related? Can't blame you thinking like a cow  the person and people you're pained for regards cows lives more than human lives.
1775 2018-09-03 19:58:13 Is not that crazy when you are already used to oil paintings 
1776 2018-09-03 19:58:12 Foundation collects on dry patches, and slides right off oily skin. T-T I know that struggle. I kinda just embrace the oil and call it "dewy."
1777 2018-09-03 19:58:11 I honestly miss eating pounded yam and better okro soup soaked in palm oil and better beef. 
Moreso! I miss egusi like mad. 

Hate hate hate hate this oilless vegetable always.
1778 2018-09-03 19:58:04 I have a lot of respect for Brad Walls, people  in Saskatchewan , but to me the oil industry matter  is a big mess.  "Une chatte n'y retrouverait pas ses chats" ;)  Miaou!!
1779 2018-09-03 19:57:58 i washed my hair yesterday but bc i worked out i now look like i dumped my hair in oil, i am : annoyed
1780 2018-09-03 19:57:57 WHAT IS YOUR VIEW ON MARAJUANA?  AND CBD OIL?
1781 2018-09-03 19:57:49 They are gagging on snake oil!
1782 2018-09-03 19:57:35 They're "caprese stacks", so a slice of tomato, a slice of mozzarella, and a bit of basil. I assume also sprinkled with salt and pepper and a bit of olive oil.
1783 2018-09-03 19:57:28  Go Omar!! Send Maxine back to her snake oil selling..
1784 2018-09-03 19:57:19 I remember windfall profit tax. Killed the wildcatter oil companies in Texas and support companies like local geologists, geophysics companies. Lost my job. Town dried up. Had to sell my home at a loss. Went from doing gravity surveys to driving a forklift.
1785 2018-09-03 19:57:14 1. The Economic Survey 2018 estimates that every $10 per barrel increase in the price of oil reduces growth by 0.2-0.3% points. The survey said that country's economic growth is expected to grow between 7-7.5% in 2019 FY, while flagging concerns over rising crude oil price.
1786 2018-09-03 19:57:08 Me, just casually reading @chefandthef’s recipe for pork chops...

“Brown the chops, two at a time, on both sides, making sure that the hot oil also KISSES THE FATTY LIPS OF EACH CHOP.” 

Emphasis my own, but goodness!!!
1787 2018-09-03 19:56:59 Sorry, he's gargling with coconut oil and doing bench presses until he passes out, usual post game loss ritual.
1788 2018-09-03 19:56:52 Salads! A mix of different salad types, like romaine & iceberg. Grape tomatoes, kalamata olives, red onions, cucumber (although be sparing with them). Dressings must be oil based & not creamy ones.
1789 2018-09-03 19:56:51 I promise I’ll have some art for you guys this week!! It’s been too hot to oil paint so I’m just living in bodies of water.

What are you all working on this week?
1790 2018-09-03 19:56:43 Aren't you really a girl???  
1791 2018-09-03 19:56:43 Eggs (omelettes are excellent), a little lower sugar fruits, like apples or blueberries. Lots of water. Almond milk is OK, as it's mostly water, not dairy. Stick to the "unsweetened" which is 30 calories per 8oz serving. Exxtra virgin olive oil or canola oil for cooking
1792 2018-09-03 19:56:42 Yo said, "the oil tank was as dry as his dick" 
1793 2018-09-03 19:56:38 "Even if it means sacrificing everything"  Yep, he sacrificed obscurity.   Brave.
1794 2018-09-03 19:56:31 Hello, just so you know this isn't our shellac based primer. This is an all purpose primer, oil based so will cover stains. Our shellac Prime- All is great for knots, stains & odour. Thanks Danielle D

1796 2018-09-03 19:56:03 Those chips look rank Mel, need fresh oil and a hotter temperature 
1797 2018-09-03 19:56:02 Bottles found in Sharjeel's room contain oil and honey, blood sample devoid of alcohol traces: reports
1798 2018-09-03 19:56:00 @ACSolarInc with renewable energy industry there are more companies as Barrier to entry lower than oil, gas, and coal to power electricity. Which = to more diverse investment and employment.
1799 2018-09-03 19:55:44 Some of the many excellent Oil & Gas Engineers I know who are EU Citizens are getting ready to leave the UK. This is going to be very very bad to the Oil sector due to #Brexit
1800 2018-09-03 19:55:38 Look, it's simple. He's seen how much is available without the kind of work that a successful tech company would require so he's making the plays that will get him embedded in the game.

1801 2018-09-03 19:55:18 So there were two sperm and  they are traveling, one says are we almost there yet and the other replies, no man we just passed the tonsils.

1803 2018-09-03 19:55:00 Same like olive oil and honey =alcohol #hypocrisy
1804 2018-09-03 19:54:58 I second the klonopin/cbd vape (oil somehow doesn’t work that well for me now), and tequila. Lol 
1805 2018-09-03 19:54:55 SELECT OIL IS HERE UNTIL 8PM!
BUY ANY DISPOSABLE GET ONE FOR 10 CENTS OR BUY ANY CARTRIDGE GET A BATTERY FOR 10 CENTS!
1806 2018-09-03 19:54:51 They lost me when they signed Michael Vick again.   I'm not buying what they're selling.
1807 2018-09-03 19:54:47 Seriously, who cares? This is the Venezuelans' problem, not ours. Insult ourselves would transparently be for oil interests and nothing else, taking a huge amount of domestic rage and giving it a big fat target to the north...and would accomplish us nothing in the end.
1808 2018-09-03 19:54:42 how does olive oil lose its virginity?
1809 2018-09-03 19:54:25 I work on a oil rigs mate so I won't b back on my ps4 for another 8days
1810 2018-09-03 19:54:24 Same with daily echinacea and vitamin D. Also a good multivitamin, extra vitamin C, and oil of oregano (capsule or liquid).
1811 2018-09-03 19:54:21 My new favorite for making avocado toast is to put Trader Joe’s “everything bagel” seasoning on avocado mixed with a little basil olive oil. That seasoning with avocado is awesome!
1812 2018-09-03 19:54:16 This man was a puppet, the dumbest leader of the free world. Went into Iraq under false pretences of WMD found none so Halliburton could get the Oil contracts and sent hundreds of Americans to there death in doing so......I’d pick a different leader myself
1813 2018-09-03 19:54:11 Jonathan. I said direct/indirect. It’s not relevant who owned you. 

You’re officially denying North Sea Oil & it’s own murky politics had any beneficial effects on Aberdeen Football Club?
1814 2018-09-03 19:54:10 I appreciate popcorn I make from the seeds . Not any other type. The oil and seed ratio and perfect heat is my spillion

1818 2018-09-03 19:53:43 Powder! I’m combination and can’t do the extra oil
1819 2018-09-03 19:53:38 I like the onion fried in oil
I like the onion because it is good
I like the onion fried in oil
I like the onion, I like the onion
1820 2018-09-03 19:53:19 Just ate a piece of chicken, and yep. Big difference is you’re not using all the oil and shit, so it’s healthier for you.
1821 2018-09-03 19:53:01 Yet they send negotiators to us for trade deals, they follow our lead with strengthening NATO and dealing with  Syria, more are moving their embassies to Jerusalem, Arab countries are binding together to fight terrorism, The EU is coming to us to compete with Russia for oil
1822 2018-09-03 19:52:55 You gotta get the clogs out, before fresh oil can come through
1823 2018-09-03 19:52:51 can u pls play rotten teeth and american oil lamb ... i beg of u

1828 2018-09-03 19:52:20 I also sell pain relief cream, moisturizing cream, CBD oil for dogs and treats!
1829 2018-09-03 19:52:11 Surely you can’t be comparing a price of water to oil.
1830 2018-09-03 19:52:06 If you have really dry hands, I would suggest mixing original non flavored Greek yogurt, extra virgin coconut oil and honey. Scoop a generous amount and rub that shit on your hands, let it sit for like 5 min and then rinse. Don’t wash. My hands feel amazing rn.
1831 2018-09-03 19:51:58 Just so that we are clear, the oil from rapeseed is a sustainable replacement to petroleum oils. I guess we can just go back to the good old days of drilling for oil and prospecting and forget all this new-fangled sustainability stuff?! Great idea 
1832 2018-09-03 19:51:50 @MikeHudema Are the tankers bringing Oil from corrupt countries and regimes safer on Atlantic waterways?  Answer the question, #hypocrite @Greenpeace employee
1833 2018-09-03 19:51:48 I’m going back in my head to what made m skin break out... the oil make up remover or the smash box primer.. I’ve used the primer before but not the oil 
1834 2018-09-03 19:51:33 yes - you just pop them in a bag and they're set to go. mine came with a little cotton pouch that you zip them into, and I add a few drops of essential oil for scent  #EthicalHour #zerowasteweek

1838 2018-09-03 19:51:10 looking forward to either absolute equal Canada and USA pricing at the consumer level or keeping our natural resources here in Canada. Stop the raw logs and stop the bitumen oil. Process and use them here in Canada.
1839 2018-09-03 19:51:03 Coconut oil and black magic

1844 2018-09-03 19:50:23 Tell that to the millions of people in SE Asia who use it on a daily basis - does he have shares in palm oil ? Silly article
1845 2018-09-03 19:50:20 わりと眠くて脳死んでたし、対抗きてたら混乱してやらかしそうだったので助かりました
1846 2018-09-03 19:50:03 Look at venezuela now.
More like "Hugo Chavez declared the oil belonged to him and the scum in the government. He used the oil $ to get rich and to eliminate 75% of the population, provide no health and medicines, no education, and crime 4 all" 
All these communists are the same
1847 2018-09-03 19:49:45 Oga Reno, oil plenty oil dey for your head
1848 2018-09-03 19:49:38 You have to work on yourself first. If you're broken then you attract brokenness.

1854 2018-09-03 19:49:10 Gamora smiled, picking herself up off the floor. He was right, she looked pretty clumsy at that point. 

On top of that, she was now covered in dust thanks to all the oil. 

"I think it's about time I did something." 

The assassin slipped her wedding ring off her finger. >
1855 2018-09-03 19:49:09 It’s an edible oil product that simulates whipped cream. Basically for lactose intolerant ppl, BUT it’s great for getting medication into reluctant animals!
1856 2018-09-03 19:49:08 Then it makes sense. I don’t believe you can predict how long oil will dominate the economy, or how long china will want it. But smarter people than you can, and they were willing to invest billions. And I’m not talking about the feds.
1857 2018-09-03 19:48:59 Elon, looks like solid H2O is confirmed at the lunar poles.  Any chance SpaceX will get in on some space oil action? #spacemining #blueoil #SpaceX #Nasa
1858 2018-09-03 19:48:48 Oil your belly
1859 2018-09-03 19:48:43 I sholl was about to akk a fool if my car wasn’t next for this oil change.
1860 2018-09-03 19:48:43 Gil & Elizabeth, it wasn't lack of rigour nor a failure to refine oil here that created this mess. It was clearly two decades of anti-oilsands anti-Alberta anti-pipeline activism from yourselves & others that don't like fossil fuels. I read the entire TMX decision, weak reasons.
1861 2018-09-03 19:48:40 I give my dogs Hemp oil, along with calming them down, no fleas ! Ones out 24/7. I’ve never tried capsules but I use it twice a day for, back pain, anxiety and depression, no more meds !

1863 2018-09-03 19:48:32 Currently he's eyeing Venezuela. Putin is angry with them over their oil contract and it's too expensive to send Russia's army so he told Trump to send Americans to Venezuela to die for Russia oil.
1864 2018-09-03 19:48:26 Edit: instead of gold, try 
Want more dividends from their oil stocks.
1865 2018-09-03 19:47:56 La compré en Primor pero no la había visto antes. La que dices la quería probar pero no recuerdo si tenía paraffinum o mineral oil, uno de los dos fijo, y no me gustan en las hidratantes.  La que he comprado no los lleva, así que perdí el culo XD
1866 2018-09-03 19:47:52 Tea tree oil works wonders!
1867 2018-09-03 19:47:41 I get to teach my kids more auto repair soon!

Need to replace struts, brakes and AC evaporator core on our van. Plus oil change, air filter and plugs. This is just the beginning too.

FML, this isn't going to be cheap....
1868 2018-09-03 19:47:39 Does he have an oil can in his hand? Something shining there. The guard definitely posing and looking very dapper -a man of some importance!
1869 2018-09-03 19:47:32 i kinda miss oil painting but man it takes up so much space that i currently don't have...
1870 2018-09-03 19:47:28 Asked my mom :Onions neutralise the oxidative effect of the chemicals in the oil and help prevent cancer.
1871 2018-09-03 19:47:28 ジェシカさんのタイミング被りもあったけど対抗でなかったしなんか信じやすかった感じかな
1872 2018-09-03 19:47:06 But yet the powers that be can't stop the societal war on women with its acid attacks, hot oil burnings, gang rape on buses and mob action for conceived wrong doing.
1873 2018-09-03 19:47:02 We’ve had cheap $ for years, but the recent downward trend in M&A, and use of stock for M&A transactions legitimize the argument that cheap $ has kept the Ponzi scheme going. Not just cheap debt but cheap $ for investors to put into these shale oil companies.
1874 2018-09-03 19:47:02 Its high time Kenyans sat down our leaders na wataonyeshe this deals they have signed from SGR,titanium,turkana oil etc.We are the ones paying tukikatwa mshahara every month,its our right to know na si tafadhali. #FuelPriceHike #FuelHike

1876 2018-09-03 19:46:54 So far my experience is just even more deafness. Hoping after two weeks and a bottle of Tesco’s finest olive oil I might be able to hear again.
1877 2018-09-03 19:46:53 I’ve finally integrated all those new skin care products into my routine w/o any adverse reactions and the oil cleanser and snail mucin are my favorites my skin is so fucking soft and hydrated dAMN
1878 2018-09-03 19:46:41 Well Paul,  they obviously want to rattle the populous. it's said the leaders literally feed off fear. 
 With zero point electricity generators and anti gravity craft...... who needs the illuminati oil, coal and other 20th century fantasy.
1879 2018-09-03 19:46:35 #aaog
Persistent and irritating seller on #aaog but share price is soaking this well.

1881 2018-09-03 19:46:11 Every inch of my body is soaked in coconut oil. I feel like a clean island-y slug bae
1882 2018-09-03 19:46:09 No water, no ladders, no fire trucks, no sprinkler systems.  Country run by corrupt leftist socialists. Any correlation?
1883 2018-09-03 19:46:02 Ah yes thank youu!! Some recognition finally!!! Jojoba oil was my holy grail tbh
1884 2018-09-03 19:46:00 ぼあ早く寝ろ
1885 2018-09-03 19:45:50 I hope not. My Dad did that every week for about 20 years before he died.*

*Not from olive oil poisoning.

1893 2018-09-03 19:44:42 Crap.  If Cows eat grass it releases methane. It grass is not eaten and just rots it produces methane.  Cows do not use fossil fuels to harvest grass like CO2 tractors do to harvest  corn or wheat.  They produce top quality very digestible protein without fuel Big oil hates them
1894 2018-09-03 19:44:38 Happy Labour Day!  All 3 locations of Olive Us Oil & Vinegar Tasting Room will be closed today to spend a little time with family and friends!

1901 2018-09-03 19:44:16 Yes but it took $68/barrel avg WTI Q2 2018 to make 62% of tight oil companies CF positive. 38% are CF negative incl. Permian luminaries Parsley, EPE, Diamondback & Laredo. In Q1, only 48% were CF positive at $61.75 WTI. Yet they all claimed they were making $ at $40 WTF.
1902 2018-09-03 19:44:15 #NHRA  Dad wants to know how much oil the oil pans hold? Yall didn't mention that. Thanks
1903 2018-09-03 19:44:09 Not true I live in Florida and I tested positive for marijuana from CBD oil purchased over-the-counter from health food store!

1905 2018-09-03 19:43:27 At least some cocoa butter or coconut oil.
1906 2018-09-03 19:43:18 After 3 months of ear infections the GP has me putting olive oil in my ear three times a day. After giving it a go I can safely say I think I’m being had here. On the bright side, the insides of my ears will live to at least 100. The rest of me, not so much.

1909 2018-09-03 19:43:08 Disappointed in my neighbors.  Not only do they apparently buy Tom Brady-branded snake oil, but they don't flatten the comically large boxes before putting them in the recycling bins that the whole building shares.
1910 2018-09-03 19:43:02 noted. I'm refering to most recent history. Oil was $33.16 in Jan 2016.
1911 2018-09-03 19:42:54 Where do you get your fake news, from FOX. Take a good look. Oil comp. making $50 billion more last quarter than they did last year. Employees getting nothing but gas prices 48 cents/gal. higher. Inflation now up 2.5% and over $1 trillion of debt. GOOD JOB.
1912 2018-09-03 19:42:48 Not all church queens are bottoms, they’ll trade their Chelsea boots and handkerchiefs for fitteds and gun oil in a heartbeat
1913 2018-09-03 19:42:40 Girl, I’ve tried literally everything! Pineapple, dates, raspberry leaf tea, baths, sex, exercise ball, jumping on a trampoline lol and I even stooped down to castor oil

1919 2018-09-03 19:42:03 Claro, el gas oil (insumo) está a $35, entonces el boleto de colectivo (soja) debería estar a 35 + una rentabilidad razonable, eh??
Bueno Salvador, su tw sin cantidades dice algo así
1920 2018-09-03 19:41:58 This guy has an oil block all to himself. What do you think ?
1921 2018-09-03 19:41:55 Yes, hydrates ,prevents excess oil to skin, cleans out your pores and tones your skin

1927 2018-09-03 19:41:34 Oil gets delivered thousands of kilometers via pipelines across the world. What would be so difficult in delivering water?
1928 2018-09-03 19:41:24 Oh Wendi. I would so love you to try our dōTERRA fractionated coconut oil  pllleeeasse let me be the one to hook you up!! My 9 year old son would be giddy as a kipper hehe 
1929 2018-09-03 19:41:23 would sage oil work as well as bundles for clearing? I can’t burn anything in my new flat
1930 2018-09-03 19:41:12 I usually blow dry it out and add tons of hair oil on my tips before straightening it. The pain of not wanting to ruin your hair but styling intensive hairstyle ajdjsjdnsn
1931 2018-09-03 19:41:08 Gary buddy, Where are the ethics in the Saudi oil being imported?
1932 2018-09-03 19:41:02 "A cartel of corrupt politicians and militaries who deal with drugs and weapons, and also bleed the largest proven oil reserves in the world. A failed state." In other words "socialism". The fantasy never quite lives up to the reality. Weird how predictable that is.
1933 2018-09-03 19:41:00 in persian cooking it’s a base spice. typically a generous dash is added when browning onions or meat - it infuses nicely into oil, and gives it rich color
1934 2018-09-03 19:40:57 Enjoy getting passed around as a series of trades while we objectify you, an actual person, like ExxonMobil would an oil deal.
1935 2018-09-03 19:40:44 市民で勝てたの始めてでうれしかった！！
1936 2018-09-03 19:40:44 Yooooo. I looked at the oil created on top after cooking it for awhile and yeah. I felt like I can be a master chef
1937 2018-09-03 19:40:40 I pity the fool that messes with my coconut oil  #treeoflife
1938 2018-09-03 19:40:30 マテウス、あのおねーさんよくね？
1939 2018-09-03 19:40:21 Where does Oil King get his shorts?
1940 2018-09-03 19:40:16 So we're just going to forget and forgive him bombing innocent people to steal their oil, along with us going into a financial crisis where many many many people lost their homes due to foreclosure? I get it Bush looks great compared to Trump but that's not really saying much.
1941 2018-09-03 19:40:12 They have a small amount of soybean oil, but they are selling it on the low sugar content on TV.

1944 2018-09-03 19:40:04 Wait, there’s more  

The set comes with 1 beard oil, not 2 and the prices I gave you may have been limited to the #SalonAfrica Expo so they could vary.

Lastly, you’re welcome. 
1945 2018-09-03 19:40:01 One of my best friends did the same thing when I told her coconut oil is probably not the best lube
1946 2018-09-03 19:39:56 As well, in Ross' world, big oil can be bad one week, good the next, and bad the week after. Makes life easy, to have such flexible values. $TSLA
1947 2018-09-03 19:39:50 If some Trump voters said this was reason for support, they would have to explain why they ignored his bellicose rhetoric against Iran and plan to deploy 30K troops in Iraq and seize their oil.
1948 2018-09-03 19:39:48 Olive oil 
1949 2018-09-03 19:39:43 Even if this claim were true, who cares? Society benefits from Uber’s existence. Society benefits from fracking & the resulting ramp in domestic oil/gas production. Give me all the irrational exuberance you’ve got.
1950 2018-09-03 19:39:40 It rly sucks when you're man works in the oil field because you'll get clean clothes out of the dryer and they still look dirty af

1952 2018-09-03 19:39:37 Hey Peter! Great choice. That color change is is called pull-up and is one of the reasons why Copper Rough & Tough is our most popular leather. If you want it darker, just rub them with your thumb or condition them with a little Mink Oil or Leather Conditioner.
1953 2018-09-03 19:39:36 Man I really lost some expensive ass facial oil and that’s the only thing I use on my face and I’m pissed
1954 2018-09-03 19:39:33 Nahhhh a put oil based paint in ma hair and now it’s stained ma hair pink and it’s no washing oot
1955 2018-09-03 19:39:28 Is big oil a special interest group? Obviously they are, same as all special interests groups are simply that. All are out for their own interests, not always in line for the good of the country.
1956 2018-09-03 19:39:19 I’m pretty sure that Bush will get the McCain hagiography treatment when he dies, even from people who were chanting “no blood for oil” back in the day.
1957 2018-09-03 19:39:13 We use bottles for oil and honey storage too...
1958 2018-09-03 19:39:07 DD and CR17 is like water and oil

1962 2018-09-03 19:38:43 Remember that Democrat Kamalatoe Harris is an unindicted co-conspirator in a failed attempt to blame a single oil company for FUTURE costs of sea level rise due to a melting planet.  It was laughed out of court even by the ultra-liberal 9th Circuit Court.

1963 2018-09-03 19:38:37 I usually just put a lil of my farsali rose gold oil in which helps! But then it dries out again  
1964 2018-09-03 19:38:31 When is the @FBI bringing to justice the crook occupying the White House? He must not be above the law, no one is. Why is he getting away with so much shit? Obstruction collusion money laundering, campaign fraud and list goes on and on and on. Snake oil salesmen @realDonaldTrump
1965 2018-09-03 19:38:25 Dad made sure we could do anything. I was helping him dig ditches in clay as a kid to install signs, putting oil in the car & swapping out brakes. If we couldn’t do it, we learned how by watching others.
1966 2018-09-03 19:38:24 I really do not know how anyone can survive if they do not apply baby oil after shower like wow this is cruel
1967 2018-09-03 19:38:20 Much of that is due to the fact that the industry has been glutted with surplus for many years.  The oil barons weren't moving product and they deflected any calls to lower prices.  It was a dim forecast and affecting production.  Problem solved w/Iran sanctions though.  
1968 2018-09-03 19:38:19 When Sindh police has to carry the tests then definitely bottles got honey and oil
1969 2018-09-03 19:38:00 People like you would rather support Saudi oil? More oil moving by rail?  Lack of knowledge but making comments!

1972 2018-09-03 19:37:41 A war for Oil. A war for Money. A war to control the Middle East. Not a War to stop World War Three or to take control of WMDs. Because there weren’t any WMDs. To think, Colin Powell... like Blair. A Liar.
1973 2018-09-03 19:37:28 The costs, declines, drill and comp methods, and financial engineering are all the same, industry wide. Some bal sheet differences, but overall same game ind wide. Comparing shale oil to shale gas is a big mistake.
1974 2018-09-03 19:37:25 developed a boil under my armpit that hurts like phuck. my degree deodorant is the cause due to the aluminum. been applying castor oil to it for 20min at a time for some relief.

1977 2018-09-03 19:37:11 I have reason to believe that the USA, Donald Trump and UN are not getting involved with our Dictator b'se of the oil deal they made.
Your president sold your oil
1978 2018-09-03 19:37:06 Why is it only happening to us, do they do the same in the Arab world for example, as for the Arab world, as early as 1952, Saudi Arabia was a hopeless desert like Yemen until that British explorer found oil, look how they quickly made the petro dollar work, look at Africa

1984 2018-09-03 19:36:23 Please stop this Asians-as-“people of color” crap. An Asian is of a different ethnicity, period. Like oh, Italians or Lebanese or whatever. But it’s so COOL to be POC (victimhood and all that cool stuff). Btw, exactly what “color” is an Asian??? Specify.

1987 2018-09-03 19:36:16 Your man can't even change your oil but he can change your mind.
1988 2018-09-03 19:36:09 Lemme change your oil 
1989 2018-09-03 19:36:09 You haven't been working out. Apply some heat oil or balm and walk through the pain. You'll be fine
1990 2018-09-03 19:36:08 Tell that to the polluters of the world. Our carbon footprint is negligible at best. But sure, keep importing oil from human rights champions like Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Nigeria. More money to dictators, less for our social programs. People are part of the environment too.
1991 2018-09-03 19:36:05 I give her 1 to 2 hour massages with Luxury oriental oil while she lays there asleep wearing her nicest garter belt - her big bum is all mine to stare at. She loves these nights
1992 2018-09-03 19:36:02 ur ass with oil may is the best breakfast.
1993 2018-09-03 19:36:02 No. No, no! Mayonaise is very heathy. Just eggs, vegetable oil and lemon. Ketchup and all its horrible sugar is the real evil! 
1994 2018-09-03 19:36:00 Is it still canola oil?
1995 2018-09-03 19:35:55 Norway sits on an ocean of oil and has a very homogeneous population. Source: I lived there for a year.
1996 2018-09-03 19:35:37 “Pay attention “.lady, we have a government who’s end game is a full marxist/ socialist regime.The signs of this are everywhere!,they don’t give a crap about the R/$ rate, the oil price and the investment.ruling the people is where it’s at!Besties with the chinese says something.
1997 2018-09-03 19:35:31 "Fracking is using more water and generating more toxic wastewater than it is producing oil or gas."

So why does it continue?

Water is nearly free once you own the rights. And toxic waste is otherwise expensive to dispose of.
1998 2018-09-03 19:35:20 Shower. Coconut oil  I feel soft
1999 2018-09-03 19:35:10 I ain’t even oil sheen em..
2000 2018-09-03 19:34:42 castor oil provides relief when you have a boil. helps reduce inflammation.
2001 2018-09-03 19:34:40 Politicians are working In  challenging times -How to move land locked oil,a new relationship with USA & competing inter provincial needs..
2002 2018-09-03 19:34:37 Yep. He may know where the oil goes in an engine but I bet that’s the extent of his mechanical knowledge. My late husband could have given him a few lessons.
2003 2018-09-03 19:34:25 Fortunately we also have a fireplace and I have a little space heater,  so it should be enough, but ugh... didn't want to deal with oil. Sadly, National Grid is still refusing to be a responsible company and screwing everyone 6 ways to Sunday.
2004 2018-09-03 19:34:21 vape oil. Please I must see
2005 2018-09-03 19:34:20 Whenever I miss my car. I like to burn a little bit of oil to remember the smell. <3
2006 2018-09-03 19:34:15 I understand the logic you were using, but aloe is just a plant. People also use stuff like coconut and olive oil in beauty care products too
2007 2018-09-03 19:34:07 Anywhere having a deal on oil changes ? Today
2008 2018-09-03 19:34:03 @SecPompeo The current power of the United States is to control the decision in Iraq and Qatar, and it must support the US military and intelligence presence to secure Iraqi oil and secure Qatari gas, and Iran must be prevented from controlling the wealth of Iraq and Qatar.

2014 2018-09-03 19:33:43 As per " ARY " Sharjil Memon denied ownership of Honey & Olive oil why ?
2015 2018-09-03 19:33:09 Apparently we live in a country where our CJ raids hospital wards, then publicly denounces a political worker for keeping alcohol only to find out it was, infact, honey and olive oil. We'll never run out of comedians....
2016 2018-09-03 19:33:01 Oil Marketing Companies (OMC) had to take up due to administered pricing – has reduced from a high of Rs.46,458 crores in 2013-14 to Rs. 36,580 crores in 2014-15 and further to just Rs. 18 crores in 2015-16. IT WAS NIL in 2016-17 !!
2017 2018-09-03 19:32:46 Liberals ALWAYS vote their liberalism before their "blackness," "Jewishness," "gayness," etc. and to expect them to vote any differently is a waste of time and energy.

2023 2018-09-03 19:32:02 In 1938, Oil and lumber companies blacked balled the industrial male hemp plant. You can not even get high from the male hemp plant.
2024 2018-09-03 19:31:58 without any reason to fear a major spurt from here on unless a global event results in crude oil price to shoot up.
2025 2018-09-03 19:31:57 Yes, that’s the only interest of Russian and Chinese governments. Mayor oil Venezuelan company already sold 49% of Citgo (refinery in USA) to the Russians oil companies.
2026 2018-09-03 19:31:56 Oil you say interestinggggg?
2027 2018-09-03 19:31:40 Just look for something that works for you.
Discovered coconut oil 2 years ago and the beard became softer and blacker since
2028 2018-09-03 19:31:28 So why are we not refining our own oil and becoming more@self sufficient? Why do we pump it away to other countries and then have to buy it back?
2029 2018-09-03 19:31:15 Sirji sorry but with due respect to your view, I don't think this Pappu has got guts or influence to affect production of oil by #OPEC unless off course he has offered some sinister anti India idea to them. What that cud be ?
2030 2018-09-03 19:31:06 Correction, oil prices were at an all time high when they reached close or above $140, now they're around $70
2031 2018-09-03 19:30:48 Brexit was inspired by a superficially plausible guy with a pint in one hand, a fag in the other! and NO policies in either back pocket! This was snake oil stuff aimed at feeding prejudice! England & Wales were conned. Scotland & NI not! And so the balkanisation began! But wait..
2032 2018-09-03 19:30:46 Hmm....kinda sounds familiar only 38 years later doesn’t it?

Carter was an absolute disaster.  Oil embargo/gas prices/availability , Savings & Loan crash, complete lack of full time jobs. Sounds like the worst President in history, only he just left office 2 years ago.
2033 2018-09-03 19:30:44 These are the folks that voted for EA being "one of the most corrupt companies in the world" or whatever that poll was a few years back lol. Higher than like oil and tobacco companies
2034 2018-09-03 19:30:37 lemme oil and brush ya beard.
2035 2018-09-03 19:30:27 Just watched The episode “con man” Dirty Money series on Netflix. Wow! True definition of a grifter/con man. And there are still people who will buy the snake oil believing it will cure them. Sad

Surely it wouldn’t be Alaska Tanker Oil your using. Your lack of what you call intelligence shows. 90’/ of Vanc Gas/Oil is Alberta Pipeline
2038 2018-09-03 19:30:11 @AmbJohnBolton In the event of sanctions on the Iranian oil sector, the EU will work to support the purchase of Iranian oil in the euro, and China will buy Iranian oil in yawan, and this threatens the petro-dollar and must move to prevent China and Europe to support Iran
2039 2018-09-03 19:30:01 @SecPompeo In the event of sanctions on the Iranian oil sector, the EU will work to support the purchase of Iranian oil in the euro, and China will buy Iranian oil in yawan, and this threatens the petro-dollar and must move to prevent China and Europe to support Iran
2040 2018-09-03 19:30:00 This is why we need regulation of press, and actual consequences (including criminal prosecution) of dishonourable conduct in government. The information, the message, sent to the public at large must be decent and honest, otherwise anyone can sell any sort of snake oil.
2041 2018-09-03 19:29:52 I need to buy some bio oil ASAP. I’ll be damned if i get a stretch mark.
2042 2018-09-03 19:29:36 Fry chili, lemon, garlic and greens of your choice (spinach or spring greens e t.c). Bit of oil and then mix it in with pasta. Salt and pepper and then voila. The BEST dish Xx
2043 2018-09-03 19:29:29 It’s a fair parallel to draw is it not, Jonathan? 
Oil, questionable workers safety/rights, investment & football?
2044 2018-09-03 19:29:25 Make sure to fish a bunch. You'll need all that aromatic fish oil for desserts
2045 2018-09-03 19:29:14 I don’t want a boyfriend, but having a cute boy to go thrifting with and to the olive oil store would be nice 
2046 2018-09-03 19:28:49 Nigeria's oil reserve is 37bn barrels (total discovered), if all the oil was drilled and sold today at present market price of about $76 per barrel, and shared for 198m people, every Nigerian alive will recieve N5m. Oil will not deliver the Nigerian dream - if there ever was any.
2047 2018-09-03 19:28:48 i thought the body shop's seaweed oil control line was helping my skin out but after a while, it stopped working. it was the same for innisfree's bija/cica line. i hope your skin clears up soon! i'm also hoping medicube works for good even though it's expensive.
2048 2018-09-03 19:28:46 Stranded on the side of 75.. Due to the fact there’s no oil in my car. Mind you, I just got an oil change 2 days ago

2052 2018-09-03 19:28:24 Another right winger hate preacher to be a snake oil salesman. Of course.
2053 2018-09-03 19:28:15 The reality this affects the NHS doctors nurses dentists social workers teachers IT freelancers oil workers small business etc government departments including HMRC who all reaped the cost savings. In many cases forcing people into schemes to save money.

2055 2018-09-03 19:28:04 Are you just stupid or being paid by INC to say this? You have no idea what you are saying. Due to the Turkish crisis and fall of the Lira, USD has benefited immensely. Crude oil is the reason India has net exports in negative, not due to the currency rate. Educate yourself!
2056 2018-09-03 19:28:02 my mom is a fucking muerta de hambre she literally always tries to make me pay her for using her coconut oil or one of her make up mirrors ever since i started working like wtf??
2057 2018-09-03 19:28:01 I agree, maybe Banks and governments will be bale to delay a decade or 2,maybe new wars and news bailed out will fixed for a while. It is not just BTC that has to be adopted, Oil and Fiat have to go first, and for that to happen, tragedy has to come!
2058 2018-09-03 19:27:55 if only they had natural resources, like oil, they could drag themselves out of their calamity

2080 2018-09-03 19:23:59 Johnson’s the equivalent of the snake oil salesman who persuades the business to embark on a risky new project. But when engineering find they can’t build it, marketing conclude there’s no market for it, and sales can’t sell it, he walks away and blames them rather than himself.
2081 2018-09-03 19:23:51 If Trump thought he could benefit he'd push for harvesting Whale Oil again.

2085 2018-09-03 19:23:18 it would be nice 1 hour @IvorySoles tickle torture video with brush and nails,with oil under her feet but without break, without letting breathe and without safeword.

2090 2018-09-03 19:22:50 This effect of U.S. sanction policy going to plan. Upcoming dateline this NOV: more restrictive oil sales, SWIFT cutoff. 

U.S. objective: regime change.

2095 2018-09-03 19:22:29 After listening to your show, only conclusion is govt living in fantasyworld. In Oct a further 65 cents hike forecast (85 c diesel), someone has to pay and won't be oil companies. Something's going on, hope it's not ominous. But hikes of this size invite mass action! Worrying

2099 2018-09-03 19:22:06 USD/CAD pair extended its gaily gains and touched its highest level since August 24 at 1.3102. ..the pair was trading at 1.3095, up 0.4% on the day. A combination of a relatively stronger greenback and an uninspiring crude oil price action seems to be the primary fuel..(FXStreet)
2100 2018-09-03 19:22:03 just replace every essential oil word with "water" or "lotion" any claims beyond, "well that felt nice" is crap and should be ignored.

2105 2018-09-03 19:21:14 Assuming the oil ‘sands’ ‘need’ to be exploited during transition a refinery should be built as close as possible to the source. It would create more jobs & mean more $ for the people of AB, less $ for shareholders/foreign entities and eliminate the risk of moving bitumen/slurry.
2106 2018-09-03 19:21:13 so i’m sitting here, hair up in bun with coconut oil slathered in it, turmeric on my acne scars, drinking a psl, and googling how to cure my cat’s acne.

happy holiday
2107 2018-09-03 19:21:10 FYI the railway runs down both sides of the Fraser. It already moves a multitude of products but oil should not be 1 of them. Stopping KM to save whales a joke while tanker cars run the length of the Fraser endangering already allegedly endangered wild salmon runs
2108 2018-09-03 19:21:09 Dont forget that the present administration has made only $92billion in oil revenue over the $326 billion earned by the immediate past administration and they have been able to achieve more in terms of power(8,320MW) power generation, increase in foreign reserve etc.
2109 2018-09-03 19:21:09 Vermont. Hmmmmm, aren't these Bernie Sanders' White People? Maybe their actions here are the reason Old Snake Oil Salesman never had a POC working in any of his Offices, State or DC, until he ran as an Unwanted Democrat for President.

2111 2018-09-03 19:20:56 @AmbJohnBolton America must move to secure Qatari oil and gas. Qatar must stop supporting Iran and Turkey. The solution is to change the government in Qatar to ensure the interests of the United States and prevent Iran and Turkey from stealing Qatari oil and gas.

2118 2018-09-03 19:20:22 What about the pipeline workers who have lost their jobs=$0/hr, while making the most environmentally responsible oil in the world  & thus securing jobs in the USA, Russia, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Angola, Algeria & Nigeria?
2119 2018-09-03 19:20:18 静香P！
2120 2018-09-03 19:20:07 Lmao this has always been the case but distillates have no butane in them. They're extracted using steam distillation. Most of the shit that causes the cough is the fake terpenes and extra glycerin oil they add in to cut it, make it more liquid, and give it flavor.

2123 2018-09-03 19:19:35 Everything depends on how much oil importing nations fear Trump. Overall sanction impact will be higher prices
2124 2018-09-03 19:19:34 And do you think that top oil companies will obey what RaGa says to them. And for what reason? Are you serious enough. And how come the great Modi Shah duo don't know this. They should make you their chief advisor indeed..who can advise on twitter, no need of office..blah

2131 2018-09-03 19:18:40 Second that. Carbohydrates exist in nature as sugars, starch, and fibre. Complex carbs are good and essential for one's body, as are simple sugars from fruit or veggies for instant energy. Anyone who claims jams have low carbs, or that all carbs are bad is selling you snake oil.
2132 2018-09-03 19:18:40 we had extra virgin olive oil on our counter so i pointed at it and told my priest brother “look it’s you” and he got mad LMAOOOOOO
2133 2018-09-03 19:18:29 I’ve been applying jojoba oil to my eyelashes for a little bit now and damn I notice a difference already
2134 2018-09-03 19:18:25 That's definitely one reason why supermarkets won't label their products. By positively talking about sustainable palm oil and supporting supermarkets who use it, we can encourage them to clearly label it.
2135 2018-09-03 19:18:13 I was randomly thinking about  namjoon's clumsiness while cooking  and I accidentally burned my hands with the hot oil....
2136 2018-09-03 19:18:08 @SecPompeo America must work to secure Iraqi oil from Iranian control and must secure Qatari gas from the Qatari government that works with Iran and Turkey.

2143 2018-09-03 19:16:47 @peta @PetaIndia didn't someone say coconut oil (which is the main ingredient in your recipe) is pure poison? Is PETA wanting to kill humans with this special recipe?

P. S. - Looking forward to vegan Eid and Thanksgiving tweets. 

#PetaHypocrisy
2144 2018-09-03 19:16:45 Why would they reduce shipments now when then can more easily get them out? Are they waiting for prices to rise due to the sanctions so they can sell oil on the black market at higher prices?
2145 2018-09-03 19:16:26 Ab bas shareef logon ki honey n oil bottles ko shak ki nazron se na dekha jaye

Literally no help or information on products. If you are going to call them experts train them.
2153 2018-09-03 19:15:40 Please refer to point one while I oil my hinges.
2154 2018-09-03 19:15:37 I wanted to market a T-shirt for Harley riders... "I went to Milwaukee for the 115th and all I got was.... wet."  The only consolation is there's now been enough rain to wash the oil and sand off the roads.  Water on oil or wet sand make for slippery cornering.
2155 2018-09-03 19:15:24 Oh poorly boy, has he got antibiotics?  And you have so much on.  I mean Exeter is hardly on your door step.  Ben will cope, for heaven sake Monday is so next week!

2157 2018-09-03 19:15:14 Everyone and their mom is gonna fucking defend coconut oil. Lmao. I was told to feed it to my dog, put it in my hair, also use it as lube. Like dude. No. People are fuckimg stupid.
2158 2018-09-03 19:15:11 @garymasonglobe 
And this all squares up with continuing to buy oil from Saudi Arabia. 
Has the Globe and Mail lost all sense of reality?

2167 2018-09-03 19:14:03 I am not saying PDP does not. The previous oil Minister was a crook. The fact is no one has done an audit of this government yet so I am not going to praise it yet.

E.g. seed oil benefit vs animal fats, supplementation vs nourishing diet, shampoo usage vs normal rinsing, etc...

Usually the answer is no.

2201 2018-09-03 19:10:50 I do find it amusing though, that a discussion on "barrels" of oil requires a picture that shows some 55-gallon drums. If the discussion was in "gallons" would there be pictures of 1-gallon milk jugs?

2215 2018-09-03 19:09:24 But most of India’s import bill consist of crude oil, which is traded in US Dollar. Petrol and Diesel prices are increasing due to Petro dollar and so are taxes to the government. This so called popular Govt had never bothered to reduce taxes on fuel!

2227 2018-09-03 19:07:32 Last night in my dream I was thirsty so I go to a vending machine and I intended on buying water but for some reason this vending machine had top shelf olive oil in it for $1! So of course I spent the only dollar i had on the olive oil.
2228 2018-09-03 19:07:31 They used a different type of amphora for diet and regular Coke. (Rule not applicable to all amphorae and the contents of amphorae were specific: wine, olive oil etc...)
2229 2018-09-03 19:07:19 Sprinkle a little salt in your pan if you're frying. This will prevent the oil from splattering.
2230 2018-09-03 19:07:13 And all thanks to the geopolitics of the region. #Yemen has always been a strategic location between rich resources in #Africa and oil in the Persian/Arabian Gulf.

2243 2018-09-03 19:05:21 There is no such thing as renewable energy in the way that they define it today (solar and wind), as neither are viable without a global energy infrastructure based on oil or electrification with nuclear.  Our goal is to make a megawatt as cheap as a kilowatt is today.
2244 2018-09-03 19:05:14 Hey, Millennial Hippie @MarcosPrisca - your Keto Fuel from Super Body Fuel now says to mix it with avocado oil, in preference to olive oil.  Do we get that from toast?

2253 2018-09-03 19:04:13 Wow I had no idea but if the exemption of SUVS from fleet mileage standards were ended and fleet gas mileage in the US (meaning were to improve ) by a tiny 3 miles per gallon, we would no longer need to import oil from the middle east. . .
2254 2018-09-03 19:04:06 Same with me today. Made it until 2 and crashed. Medical Cannabis has helped me significantly. High CBD and love THC strains. CBD oil helps with the anxiety as well. You’re not alone brother.

2257 2018-09-03 19:03:44 Yes you do. Oil rigs pollute the beach, and global warming from burning oil makes them submerge.

2269 2018-09-03 19:02:16 I have a question is there a possibility that Buck Miller worked for Gulf Oil in Bakersfield California in the 70’s
2270 2018-09-03 19:02:07 It was Olive oil which comes from olives which grow on trees.....honey bees mostly make hives on trees ...there you go it's linked to trees and you can link it to the tree plantation
2271 2018-09-03 19:01:59 Anyone have any info or leads on any oil field catering in the Permian basin?

2274 2018-09-03 19:01:35 He told me the other day if you just need an oil change, go to a spot that just does oil changes. Why haven't I thought of that before? I could have saved so many minutes of my life a long time ago
2275 2018-09-03 19:01:21 I only use coconut for my body bc it actually breaks my face out. For the face I LOVE jojoba, but I've never tried almond oil so I may have to.
2276 2018-09-03 19:01:20 I support renewable resources but it’s not going to happen overnight. We will need oil for the foreseeable future. Wouldn’t you prefer to get your oil from an ethical, environmentally sound source that supports our social programs, or do you support imports from Saudi Arabia?
2277 2018-09-03 19:01:15 All Banks must be stoped with immediate effect of financeing autos financeing where oil import cut is needed and constructive way of financeing must be implemented because that is public money of Pakistan and not the money of their owners.Get enhance export
2278 2018-09-03 19:01:15 The day I’ll change my oil 
2279 2018-09-03 19:01:13 Coconut oil. Melt it and saturate your hair with it specially at the ends. Take a cotton t shirt, wet it with warm water. Wrap your head. Leave it on for 1 hour or overnight (repeat once a week).My hair was burnt and dried from bleaching, this helped out a lot.
2280 2018-09-03 19:01:10 Forgot my honey and olive oil in car
2281 2018-09-03 19:01:02 The government of Guyana has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Stacy Keibler in a chintz wig.
2282 2018-09-03 19:01:01 yep. 2 came out in like 2002 and goes something like "the CIA misjudge a situation and almost cause a nuke to go off in LA" and "a shady group of multi-national businesses want to start an unjust war to seize oil shares and are willing to kill to do it"
2283 2018-09-03 19:00:59 Whoever is taking over from PMB in 2023 is going to be very lucky, why?
Dangote Refinery & ferterlizer, Lekki Ports are all running at full speed, with tremendeous impact on revenue, add the rail, roads & power projects, all these impact non oil rev. These are obvious.
2284 2018-09-03 19:00:55 I am convinced that the Court Decision to halt the KM pipeline is just part of the Liberal Plan. The volume of Cash coming into Canada to stop any Tide Water Oil Exports from Canada is Mind Boggling. Governments usually protect their people and land from this sort of thing.
2285 2018-09-03 19:00:49 well fine, it was olive oil and honey but who uses honey and olive oil of a decanter and alcohol bottle? mockery of judicial system.

2287 2018-09-03 19:00:42 People use it too much. They use their health insurance for everything, like colds. That's not the way insurance works. We're don't claim insurance for an oil change in our cars for a reason. I think that has a big impact on health insurance.

2293 2018-09-03 18:59:54 Venezuela is about to fall as well. Thanks for the Western sanctions who starve population while eyeing to nationalize then steal their enormous oil reserves.
2294 2018-09-03 18:59:53 Are you saying the standard of living in California can be equated to one in Kenya? US has its own oil reserves though Kenya doesn’t.

I have no ideology, only a good understanding of climate science. People denying it usually have an ideology (or money from Big Oil). Cherry picking is one of their most favourite tricks.

Bt if AFIC came with this result thn the propagnda boys will come up new narrative tht Zardari deal with the establishment thts why army acquit sharjeel from this.

2305 2018-09-03 18:58:16 Norway's welfare state is funded by capitalism. Our universal health care system didn't really become good before oil came around.
2306 2018-09-03 18:58:14 What about the part regarding grains being inflammatory? Also snake oil?
2307 2018-09-03 18:58:10 Our move to natural gas has made us a net oil exporter. We don't buy from the middle east anymore. Artificial moves to renewable energy doesn't create new jobs. See Solyndra.
2308 2018-09-03 18:58:05 Yes, we’ll celebrate your rolling back worker safety protections affecting underground mine safety inspections, offshore oil rigs and line speeds in meat processing plants, among others.
2309 2018-09-03 18:57:33 that oil on the side of the nose go crazy
2310 2018-09-03 18:57:23 Objectively I know my feelings are slightly irrational, but there are still children separated from families, farmers that are struggling, rising oil prices, and stagnation in wages. The market can’t hold this forever -> why put your money down in support of said administration.
2311 2018-09-03 18:57:22 Ones that refuse to read the Bible, soon it will be a closed book to you, the ones letting all oil seep out of you, the Holy Ghost. We're told to walk in the spirit, talk in it. Stop thinking grace will cover you in your sins.

2314 2018-09-03 18:57:03 Refineries in Alberta?!  Would be nice but Alberta is landlocked.  Do you have any idea how many pipelines would be needed to move all the different products made from oil?!  Not realistic.  Now, if Alberta had access to water...say Churchill, Manitoba.....
2315 2018-09-03 18:56:51 These are the same people that tried to tell us that coconut oil is bad, and that low carb diets shorten your lifespan. I don’t trust anything they say and neither should anyone else. They’re too connected to the fast food industry to have any credibility. Money, money, money.

2322 2018-09-03 18:55:50 Beto has a terrible record. Voted no for hurricane Harvey Relief, proposed a 10$ tax on each barrel of oil. He wants to raise taxes on the middle class. He’s flees a drunk driving scene in a crash he caused. He refuses to debate Ted Cruz. He wants to abolish homeland security.
2323 2018-09-03 18:55:49 No, you don't, skip the milk and use a little vegetable or olive oil and it turns out just fine.
2324 2018-09-03 18:55:49 Yuck. What a snake oil salesman you are.

2327 2018-09-03 18:55:23 Studio Fix from @MACCosmetics controls oil and it is full coverage with a matte finish. If you have dry/dehydrated skin then you need to prime your skin first. Use the Fix+ spray to hydrate your skin before and after. I swear by it!
2328 2018-09-03 18:55:21 Malaysia must diversify its industry from oil revenues into high tech fields such as AI and machine learning if it is to compete in the 21st century.

2333 2018-09-03 18:54:51 Every last one of those greedy, selfish oil workers should be spending the next few eternities in Hell or FortMac, whichever is hotter.
2334 2018-09-03 18:54:37 This poison of an asp, is like you being bit by a snake, and keeping all the poison in you. Slowly it will kill you spiritually. The anointing oil we're told about that leaves 5 foolish virgins, this oil will leave you, bc you can't mix light and dark.
2335 2018-09-03 18:54:25 As oil from other countries goes up in desireability by being sought out by Japan and Iranian oil goes down for the reverse reason, won't the previous customers of countries now supplying Japan simply switch to Iran?

2344 2018-09-03 18:53:17 there are many much worse ways to be losing oil!
2345 2018-09-03 18:53:04 I'm hungry and I want a sub with extra onions and oil n vinegar all over it.
2346 2018-09-03 18:53:03 Billo carries his own oil.
2347 2018-09-03 18:52:54 I have to ask. If you live in Alberta, what sector do you work in? I'm guessing not something directly tied to oil.
2348 2018-09-03 18:52:40 The "Norway option" works for Norway because of their oil wealth. I'm not so sure it would be so great for the Ununited Kingdom.
2349 2018-09-03 18:52:37 Essential oil diffusers are just hipster vapes
2350 2018-09-03 18:52:31 My husband is working. In the diminishing oil patch. I hope you get this fixed!
2351 2018-09-03 18:52:21 @realDonaldTrump We only want to enforce oil and bank sanctions without any exemptions, that is, no country will be exempted, this is the minimum that you can do for us. I hope you wake up and do not forget your real friends, those who worked hard for your presidency.
2352 2018-09-03 18:52:20 I know it’s cliche but avocado toast is great- i do avocado, balsamic, olive oil, salt and pepper, and tomato on top! It’s ridiculously good
2353 2018-09-03 18:52:14 Gasoil price is less in Barma to where India is export the oil. #ReduceOilPrice
2354 2018-09-03 18:52:07 Isn't that just going to provide an opportunity for other countries to get that Iranian oil slightly cheaper until the arbitrage vanishes?  Seems like basic economics to me.
2355 2018-09-03 18:52:00 Iko.. Leta engine oil.. Ukifika nikueka na SANY inaanza kazi.
2356 2018-09-03 18:51:58 Yes... at one point the Energy East line was supposed to be a threat to a beluga birthing area in the StLawrence. But apparently endless lines of Saudi, Nigerian, Venezuelan, Iranian etc tankers, fully laden with millions of litres of oil, represent no such threat to the belugas.
2357 2018-09-03 18:51:51 Weird. That sounds like a totally new topic that has nothing to do with anything that’s been discussed. That isn’t collusion, nor would it make any collusion more acceptable. If he wants countries to buy oil from us, maybe he should stopped negotiating like a toddler.
2358 2018-09-03 18:51:34 Out of the 10 lakh crores what was the state share since it is Central Excise duty and then add up the VAT collected by the states. Then who pocketed the max revenue from oil sector, the centre or the states.
2359 2018-09-03 18:51:34 my veggie burgers are almost done, but the rosemary olive oil fries i decided to make along with it will take at least another 40 mins sigh being a chef is hard

2363 2018-09-03 18:51:11 You don't say where you reside. Oil by rail through BC is dangerous because tanker cars run down the banks of the iconic salmon river the mighty Fraser. If there was a tanker car derailment into the Fraser endangered salmon stocks could be decimated forever.
2364 2018-09-03 18:51:10 Haha nice deduction 

How many jars of honey and cAnola oil are shifted to black label bottles by u?
Do u pour honey direct from liquor bottle to Ur bread or use folk?
How many houses u have come across in Ur life which keep these eatables in whisky and vodka bottles?
2365 2018-09-03 18:51:00 Diabetes Healthy Cooking Tip: If you do use oil, use olive, corn, peanut, sunflower, safflower, vegetable, or flaxseed oil.
2366 2018-09-03 18:50:59 INGREDIENTS:                                      •2 Eggs

2369 2018-09-03 18:50:17 I think it may be because ill-informed people maybe see "palm oil" on a label for sustainable palm oil and miss out the "sustainable" bit, thinking all palm oil is bad.

2371 2018-09-03 18:49:58 Could it be that the energy department never really intervened by wanted to come across as heroes? Was there a need for a petrol raise?  The rand is doing badly and the oil price is still low, is there a demand problem?
2372 2018-09-03 18:49:55 @realDonaldTrump We have no expectations, just say that you can enforce oil sanctions without any exemption, is it really hard for the United States to do this, good. It's very convenient for the United States.

2401 2018-09-03 18:47:24 Well, let's look at the height of capitalism in the US. At, say, Rockefeller. He had a monopoly on the oil business. Did he increase the prices? Nope. Did he mistreat his workers? Nope. Did he destroy society? Nope, in fact, society greatly benefited from his business.
2402 2018-09-03 18:47:22 Hopefully a FFResque rise tomorrow

2404 2018-09-03 18:47:18 As a chemical engineer, pumping molten salts is pretty damn difficult. But if the problem was easy to solve we would have someone with a business degree solving it. As for the details, I'm not sure; I did oil and gas and then combustion simulations.

Should I be offended? I'm OK on the 1st two but found your 1st paragraph reverie about Jews bizarre (& no, it's not all about me either).
2411 2018-09-03 18:46:34 Mulcair promised to balance the budget on top of all the $ promises he made. No one believed him. The Libs  conveyed where Canada had been left by Harper & why the oil revenue downturn was going to hurt as well as what they would do to negate that impact.  Honesty=best policy

2416 2018-09-03 18:45:39 The real shame we are our so dysfunctional that small, vocal foreign funded minorities control our country & economy & pit provinces against each other. Canada loses $4M/ day in tax revenue for our oil without tide water access. Just how the Yanks want it. We’re fools.

2418 2018-09-03 18:45:34 It’s easy to “still have money” when you acquired oil blocs through dubious means.
2419 2018-09-03 18:45:33 Actually he did. House ethics was investigating and told to back off months ago, bringing it to this point. It does reflect a failure of Congress to hold members accountable, but considering all the time spent investigating this and that not surprising.

2421 2018-09-03 18:45:21 Sharjeel Episode only shows that Sindh is that part of Pakistan where writ of Federal Govt. is weak. Just like Oil and Honey in Whiskey bottles, Money Laundering Cases against Zardari and Faryal will soon collapse in courts. Naya Pakistan is no match for Purana Zardari.

2424 2018-09-03 18:45:07 Here is a question: Can you tell us without compromising your anonymity, or somebody else's safety where do you get it?  In my areas, I find it difficult to come by.

2425 2018-09-03 18:45:06 well done dude, my dads taught me how to change the oil & air filters!! feels amazing to be self sufficient. 
2426 2018-09-03 18:45:02 The mosquitos must've been out in full force with the heat, or leaving almost half of the original oil in the spray bottle attracted them. It didn't work this time. Need to go back to the original mix & experiment.

2428 2018-09-03 18:44:52 you should obviously be researching all of your tweets to make sure they are factually correct. some IMPRESSIONABLE CHILD UWU will get the wrong idea and not even google if its ok to use oil as a lube

2431 2018-09-03 18:44:35 I’ve been taking notes from my grandma’s cooking and everything is basically olive oil + onion + carrot + garlic + bay leaves + salt, pepper and other spices + tomato concentrate + whatever you’re cooking and et voilá, it’s delicious
2432 2018-09-03 18:44:32 They put out a decent beer and took a loss on it to try and curry favour with the Ford government. Cool wants to be in the cannabis oil biz and what better way to show fealty than with buckabeer. Most folks don't see it and think Ford can force prices lower.

2435 2018-09-03 18:43:57 Ok this is really funny, why would olive oil be kept in a grey goose bottle and honey in a whiskey decanter?

Stop behaving like blind bhakt
2438 2018-09-03 18:43:48 I disagree sir. Given that private investment and direct tax collection has improved, it is important to reduce excise and VAT on oil. Particularly all BJP ruled states and then pressure others. 2019 is way more important than this.
2439 2018-09-03 18:43:42 Now am craving sunflower  did they even change that oil?

Finding tons of gold could affect Market Price send gold lower in price.
Oil priced in Gold would rise if gold fell.

2456 2018-09-03 18:42:07 If capitalist investment is the solution, why is Nigeria so poor? They export more oil than any other African country, yet they are dirt poor. Mass illiteracy. Low life expectancy. Western corporations have been "investing" there for over a century.
2457 2018-09-03 18:42:05 Learned how to successfully do an oil change on my SUV! Complicated yet fun with my dad coaching me through it while I'm under the SUV searching for the bolt or what I would call the "nipple bolt" to let out the dirty oil. I always enjoy times like this with my dad.

2459 2018-09-03 18:41:50 No! Don't punish the ocean & it's sealife! He's punishing it enough by opening it up to pollution from dumping, more oil companies to drill & fisheries to harvest with abandon. The oceans need protection, not putrid Trump!

2462 2018-09-03 18:41:42 Your party that wasn't corrupt where did put the money you earn from oil in 16 years. Under PDP reserve was raising to the bottom despite earning huge. Useless party
2463 2018-09-03 18:41:42 Trump is a con man, snake oil salesman . Poor working folks without the ability or time to research Trump’s history fell victim to the oldest scam. It’s unfortunate, Madoff and Trump, the worst cons of the decade.
2464 2018-09-03 18:41:38 Rounded up by the NKVD, shot by Cossaks, whatever. Authoritarians are authoritarians, it doesn't matter what bullshit philosophy they pretend to offer the desperate people. It's always snake oil.
2465 2018-09-03 18:41:34 Tauba tauba... Tests show it was honey and oil. All these false accusations against the angelic Sharjeel who has never done anything wrong.

2473 2018-09-03 18:41:05 Optics, that's all.

Looks like Gov is filling it's coffers at the cost of common people. May be getting ready for 2019 election
2476 2018-09-03 18:40:54 Thanks! You’re right  Happy naturals! You find it in Sainsbury’s it’s genuinely really good stuff, the shampoo and conditioner is great. Like top stuff before lush or high price items. It was called: Happy Naturals Soothing In-Shower Moisturiser Monoi Oil & Shea Butter xx

2478 2018-09-03 18:40:37 At the same time if you guys are happy and haven’t had any health issues using coconut oil go right ahead and keep using it! It’s just good to know the “dangers”

2486 2018-09-03 18:40:00 But we all know that there was neither Olive Oil nor honey in bottles 
2487 2018-09-03 18:39:35 Perfectly shows how wokeness is so corrosive. What started as an understandable, adolescent insecurity morphed into a learned, lifelong grievance she now projects onto others. If she wants to wallow in her own self-pitying pigshit, fine, but don’t drag others into it.

2502 2018-09-03 18:37:16 This is why oil will still be king during the next 30yrs. Combustion engines are still being replaced with combustion engines. 
We are still a long way off from electric vehicles being the norm.

2504 2018-09-03 18:37:06 The main difference between MCT oil and coconut oil is their MCT content. Coconut oil is 55% MCTs, while MCT oil is made 100% of MCTs. Furthermore, coconut oil contains all 4 medium-chain fatty acids, including large quantities of lauric acid, the least efficient MCT.

2512 2018-09-03 18:36:31 Basically all we have to do to kill oil is make it so oil companies and oil consumers have to pay the true and accurate price of that oil. That is not a good business to invest in

2534 2018-09-03 18:34:30 ....but the problem was that the oil companies made it corrupt by offering large amounts of their oil wealth in exchange for impunity.

The problem here isn't the government it's the corrupting influence of capital.

Yep.

2547 2018-09-03 18:33:23 Very sad indeed. Almost whole Pakistan understands that there is no logic to put olive oil in whiskey bottles. That too for an already doubtful politician. 
Have a heart please
2548 2018-09-03 18:33:20 And natural gas isn't going anywhere any time soon. Oil wells produce a lot of gas (the worst wells produce only gas) and operators are required to sell it instead of flare it (the state can't tax a flare). And we have a lot of domestic gas reserves.
2549 2018-09-03 18:33:15 The Trump administration has rolled back worker safety protections affecting underground mine safety inspections, offshore oil rigs and line speeds in meat processing plants, among others

2552 2018-09-03 18:33:10 Haven't yet, but will look into it.  I don't smoke so will check out cannabis oil.  Heard it may work.  Thanks :)
2553 2018-09-03 18:33:05 Hey Twitter, is Almond Oil better than Coconut Oil for your skin?
2554 2018-09-03 18:33:03 Obviously thats what was put in them before sending to the lab.

Question remains, can't they use ' Roh Afza' type of bottles to store their 'Olive Oil' and 'Honey' !!!
2555 2018-09-03 18:33:02 Sounds like none of this would be an issue if you were just born blind and couldn't see a difference. Leftists focus on the most superficial things
2556 2018-09-03 18:32:54 The Trump administration has rolled back worker safety protections affecting underground mine safety inspections, offshore oil rigs and line speeds in meat processing plants, among others
2557 2018-09-03 18:32:42 No look back at what I actually said. They can’t be blamed for the oil price dropping but what they then decided to do IS their fault. You don’t get out of falling tax receipts by printing more money. You cut back on public spending otherwise you end up where Venezuela is now.
2558 2018-09-03 18:32:40 The Trump administration has rolled back worker safety protections affecting underground mine safety inspections, offshore oil rigs and line speeds in meat processing plants, among others
2559 2018-09-03 18:32:34 This is because UK gov runs the oil industry to make a few individuals rich.
Norway runs it to make the whole nation rich for generations to come.

2560 2018-09-03 18:32:27 Why? Is it inaccurate? Johnson has shown himself to be a political snake oil salesman. Willing to strap himself to whichever mast he believes will further his own career.Johnson has not yet found a single cause that he values more than his career.

2562 2018-09-03 18:32:20 Somebody take me car to get an oil change.  I hate going !
2563 2018-09-03 18:32:15 I remember a friend sharing a picture of a palm-sized blister they had from an oil burn. Same attitude from the manager pretty much :|
2564 2018-09-03 18:32:10 When you watch someone fall off of a ladder & beat himself up, & that gets followed up by him bumping off of someone's dick, it takes it all away. The match & the dick spot were oil and water; It's not even following a shooting w/ a stabbing, it's following it with a pillow fight
2565 2018-09-03 18:32:02 Thanks  she was wondering down a country lane covered in oil, flees and her own pee.. I'm sure she came from the local traveler camp but I obviously stayed clear of that place.. I think they used her for puppies and simply abandoned her
2566 2018-09-03 18:31:55 why doesnt every car place let you stay in the car while they change your oil 
2567 2018-09-03 18:31:47 Hide your honey, and your favourite bottle of oil, it’s the beginning of prohibition in the land of Judge Dedh Hoshiyaar. The latest superhero dispensing justice whether anyone wants him to or not.
2568 2018-09-03 18:31:38 just because others are expanding oil production, does not mean we have to as well  when something is detrimental to our planet "they do it" so we should is no reason, we have plenty of oilsands production as is , no need to expand it
2569 2018-09-03 18:31:32 Russia is a gas station posing as a country. Trump opened oil pipelines and new energy exploration to undercut its influence. He also armed Ukraine to prevent Russia’s further expansion. Tell me exactly why Russia would want a Trump presidency?
2570 2018-09-03 18:31:21 After decades of pilfering from working class, it will take congress to get on board to fix it. It hasn't been 2years yet and you want to blame it on all 1guy? You got poisoned fromm all that snake oil politician forced on you.
2571 2018-09-03 18:31:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, however evaded justice.
2572 2018-09-03 18:30:58 To be fair the EPA has been corrupt for a long time, the Dakota access pipeline and keystone XL being perfect examples of them allowing oil companies to bypass environmental protections. But you are right in that it certainly isn't getting any better.
2573 2018-09-03 18:30:55 Due to their thick size they are less crunchy. Thin chips fried with olive oil are the best type of chip and no one can tell me otherwise.

2578 2018-09-03 18:30:22 I burnt my hand with really hot oil I was still hunger so I kept cooking
2579 2018-09-03 18:30:08 Not even close, Trump and his cronies are making loads if money off the working man and jacked up oil and gas prices! That's about it. The rest of us are left in the dust!
2580 2018-09-03 18:30:00 #LaborDay honors the “working people” and there’s no better example than the hard-working men and women in New Mexico’s oil and gas industry. Thank you for driving our economy and creating a better future for all of us.

2592 2018-09-03 18:29:08 What gave you the absurd notion that a Canadian oil company would want anything to do with re-foresting Haiti? Did you offer them something in return? How long were you PM?
2593 2018-09-03 18:29:06 Its never different when it comes to a bubble but we are yet to see bubble valuations in front line stocks.

2595 2018-09-03 18:28:57 Well, IMHO, Alberta must be a wasteland for truly progressive and environmental friendly citizens. They are so enamoured with their oil and fossil fuel production, forsaking renewables , that a Party like the NDP will never stand a chance at re-election. Sacrificing principles
2596 2018-09-03 18:28:48 Why were honey & olive oil put in Vodka bottles? Any explanation? If you can alter the blood & police reports now, you could put some honey bottles there.

2613 2018-09-03 18:26:59 The difference between "producing", "development" and "unexploited assets" in "leverage" and "technical expertise" and "proven track record" are terms you should understand before investing in any junior oil co. Even Pentanova / Cruzsur.

2629 2018-09-03 18:24:54 Yes, we need oil to come from more civilized countries where they throw gays of the roofs and send raped women to jail or worse.

50% support covertly.
20% - who are employed by/thru DNC, only these people really oppose Trump and his 'whatever' agenda.
***News***
Mr.Trump will win 2020.
2638 2018-09-03 18:23:49 I think so. But it's a complicated sell. You'd need a jobs program so it couldn't be torpedoed as putting miners & oil & gas workers out of a job. That solution would be oil, gas & coal cleanup training. There's other components needed too.
2639 2018-09-03 18:23:48 Says the woman who put an anti oil activist on the oilsands advisory board, your time is running out, gotta look like you support our oil industry after stabbing us in the back for 3 years

2643 2018-09-03 18:23:07 From what I understand oil isn’t super great for penetration of mucous membranes bc it’s such an eager breeding ground/carrier of bacteria. Not to say you WILL have bad effects with it but it’s something to be aware of. It’s probably about the same risk as using dirty fingers

2651 2018-09-03 18:22:16 So how does an oil company genociding a native tribe involve the government?

How does a company polluting a neighborhood involve mutually beneficial exchange?

It's not the existence of hierarchy, it's the existence of a hierarchy of freedom.

2656 2018-09-03 18:21:51 All good but some qualifiers. Anchovies in olive oil, NEVER brine or vinegar. The others massively depend on if they've added sauce to them. Stay away from John West's interpretation of "teriyaki" .
2657 2018-09-03 18:21:49 Check w/ your midwife to see if she's ok w/ you using a little lemon verbena essential oil in your bath. Lemon verbena can thin the membrane/plug.

2669 2018-09-03 18:20:51 Do u keep oil in wine bottles at home? :O
2670 2018-09-03 18:20:44 I disagree. We also have light oil/natural gas, & we haven’t been able to get infrastructure built. LNG is the best example. We had a comparative & competitive advantage, & we still don’t have an LNG project built. By the end of 2019, the U.S. will have 9 bcf/d of LNG exports.
2671 2018-09-03 18:20:44 Passion can be useful but also misguided. If she was sincere about her fear of an oil spill she would be protesting the obvious procession of oil filled supertankers along the BC coast and thru the Salish Sea. And not a peep. So, it’s hard to buy the “I care” mantra.

2676 2018-09-03 18:20:18 Since Black seed oil cures everything but death I’m about to start putting it in niggas food because I’m tired of their sick in the head asses
2677 2018-09-03 18:19:44 .US economy will collapse within days if oil is traded in non dollar currency!!
2678 2018-09-03 18:19:33 I’m going to get my brocolli and sesame oil. I’ll be back...
2679 2018-09-03 18:19:23 Fuck that. Have you tried oil cartridges?
2680 2018-09-03 18:19:21 Most people who predict oil will fall never see the recovery & most who see the recovery don't see the downturn. But remember every day that goes by more oil is used (100 mbd) the decline curves get steeper & for now demand continues to grow. So fundamentally better now than 2007
2681 2018-09-03 18:19:11 When the oil comes from a country where women are sent to jail for being raped and rapist  is completely free and innocent, that's unethical oil.
2682 2018-09-03 18:19:07 Dessutom hade han väl rätt tvivelaktiga relationer till Lundin Oil som utvann olja i Sudan, mitt under inbördeskriget. Känns inte helt OK att en sådan profilerad person är involverad med företag i länder med mycket hög risk för människorättsbrott.
2683 2018-09-03 18:19:06 احنا اللي ربنا يرحمنا والله
2684 2018-09-03 18:19:02 Apologies - nothing to do with your tweet directly, but I was wondering how do you think the Nordic countries manage to have a successful market economy and high levels of equality? Can the model be replicated, sans oil?
2685 2018-09-03 18:18:58 みんなで油祭りしようよ。英訳するとオイルフェスティバル。
2686 2018-09-03 18:18:53 But did you make a deal with Union Oil and make Tilford look like a fool?
2687 2018-09-03 18:18:44 The anti oil/gas have pounded the "K" in for a very negative connotation
2688 2018-09-03 18:18:43 Thanks for the heads up! Awesome series!
2689 2018-09-03 18:18:38 Lev14:12  And the priest shall take one he lamb, and offer him for a trespass offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave offering before the LORD:  #BibleVerse
2690 2018-09-03 18:18:36 magical bean that screams all the time and takes your oil
2691 2018-09-03 18:18:28 Mint oil in my hair to relax my scalp and lavender oil on my wrists to sniff as I sleep. 
2692 2018-09-03 18:18:14 You lifted the ban on hunting all animals. Sleeping bears Cubs and all. Why? You are also letting people drill for oil in national parks. Why? For your pocket $$$
2693 2018-09-03 18:18:03 Coconut Oil? 
2694 2018-09-03 18:18:01 Jack Ryan was awesome. I hope they will continue the series.
2695 2018-09-03 18:17:47 Target trying to sell me tea tree oil for $12
Walked over to tj maxx and got it for $5
2696 2018-09-03 18:17:46 Came by my nana for an oil check and got:
•fed
•oil checked/filled
•tank filled

The woman’s a saint 
2697 2018-09-03 18:17:44 Just better paid illegal aliens it sounds like.
2698 2018-09-03 18:17:18 Making foil packs for dinner. Chicken breasts, potatoes, carrots, onions, all coated in garlic seasoned oil. Letting them cook low and slow for later. Something simple, healthy, and damn tasty.
2699 2018-09-03 18:17:09 Justin Trudeau Isn't Going To Rely On Oil Anymore. ! ?
2700 2018-09-03 18:16:52 Oil Twitter circling like vouchers around @bethanymac12 before reading the book is rediculous. Her track record with Enron should provide enough reason to read the book before commenting.
2701 2018-09-03 18:16:45 My blood is going to entirely be replaced by peppermint oil and tea by the end of this bug
2702 2018-09-03 18:16:43 Tabbouleh! This isn't a helpful recipe, I just buy/soak it, add chopped cherry tomatoes and cucumber, lots of fresh parsley and mint, lemon and olive oil, salt and pepper.
2703 2018-09-03 18:16:31 Do not believe Trump or this administration, WV is poor & getting destroyed daily by oil & gas industry.
2704 2018-09-03 18:16:29 Kids all limbs and frenetic, reminds me a bit of Oil Can...
2705 2018-09-03 18:16:27 #BRAZIL EXPORTS 4.35 MLN T CRUDE OIL IN AUGUST VS 8.10 MLN T IN JULY AND 4.58 MLN T YR AGO: TRADE MINISTRY. #OOTT
2706 2018-09-03 18:16:21 So Alcohol not found in blood of #SharjeelMemon and bottles had oil and honey.  Thanks to raid who diverted attention of media for sometime from #PresidentialElection hahaha
2707 2018-09-03 18:16:17 Forgot it was a holiday, ain’t no oil change today 
2708 2018-09-03 18:16:16 Ur army massacred our people in 1984 (Wagalla Massacre)  and are doing now in Somalia, ur army invaded Somalia without a UN mandate, Kenya is stealing our Sea and started illegal oil Exploration in Somali Water, u are building a border fence in Somali owned Land by the border
2709 2018-09-03 18:16:13 To Prof Lee Cronin here is a puzzle for an astute academic like yourself......  Scotland extracts more oil than Norway yet the latter now has >£1Trillion Oil fund bringing in $130bn for 2017.  Scotland's total Budget for 2017 £31bn.  Please explain the logic of that statement?
2710 2018-09-03 18:16:13 Check your Engine oil today.
2711 2018-09-03 18:16:02 The big seller from the big cellar must make a return. "Must get some oil for the door!"
2712 2018-09-03 18:15:44 Browned off the squirrel in butter/oil direct heat
Wrapped In Foil to keep warm,fried some onions,peppers,then added Blackberries added cider, then thickened with slaked cornflour,returned squirrel back to pan
2713 2018-09-03 18:15:36 they lie together, oil on water
2714 2018-09-03 18:15:33 When are high school going to implement a life skills class? A class that will teach you how to change a flat tire, do your taxes, write a check, start a campfire, change a diaper, add oil to your car, etc.
2715 2018-09-03 18:15:27 If you cannot use road transport because of VAT on oil use chopers!
2716 2018-09-03 18:15:13 Your father’s administration has rolled back worker safety protections affecting underground mine safety inspections, offshore oil rigs, and line speeds in meat processing plants. 

He cares nothing for the American worker.
2717 2018-09-03 18:15:10 Funny, the Dems only have standards when it comes to @realDonaldTrump. They willingly rally around this two bit snake oil, bankrupt, porn star representing, for lack of a better word sham. #walkaway
2718 2018-09-03 18:15:03 でも、シェルブールの雨傘はマジで泣きそうになった、、誰にでもある恋の話…
ララランドは気になる動きが多くて気が散った
2719 2018-09-03 18:14:47 chutiya log ho tum.
not a SINGLE rascal has gone to jail since 2014. wait you will be f** nicely in 2019.
@BJP4India do not have SPINE to clean the scum.
@RSSorg @amitmalviya @AmitShah @narendramodi
2720 2018-09-03 18:14:30 I have family who voted for Trump.  Politics isn't off limits completely, but arguing gets us nowhere.  They think Dems are the party of freeloading Socialists.   I love them, they love me.  They're in the oil business.  Oil votes Republican.
2721 2018-09-03 18:14:21 Yep. Stuck in your oil burning vehicle waiting for an oil train. In doesn’t get much worse for the climate than that. That $14 billion would be much better invested in healthy clean affordable electric transportation choices including buses, rail and ferries.
2722 2018-09-03 18:14:21 Not enough, if the fish oil brigade are to be believed
2723 2018-09-03 18:14:16 Who needs ice rinks when you can spill oil all over your kitchen floor
2724 2018-09-03 18:14:16 oil prices in turkish lira hasnt been changed much for the last 4-5 months, how do you assume this will cut oil import volumes down ?

it will only increase budget deficit,
2725 2018-09-03 18:14:02 Its too bad we can't ship her down to Venezuela for a month and let her see what happens.  Venezuela has more oil than we do and look at what condition the country is in!!
2726 2018-09-03 18:13:57 今ふと思ったけど ララランドってシェルブールの雨傘のオマージュ、、？
2727 2018-09-03 18:13:31 I get the feeling that instead, folks would rather we raise her wearing a sari and sounding like Ramesh from Big Bang Theory.
2728 2018-09-03 18:13:31 That face has more makeup than Irak has oil
2729 2018-09-03 18:13:30 I think oil Twitter is missing the point. Over 1/2 of US oil (5% of WW supply) is short cycle, high decline, low quality, and obtained via debt. It’s overall a poor business model, and cheap $ is only way it has worked.
2730 2018-09-03 18:13:29 How about taking everything that oil and gas provides you out of your life... you would be living outdoors hunting with sticks and rocks! Even the phone you are reading this on utilizes oil byproducts for manufacturing!
2731 2018-09-03 18:13:28 I go between 3 - depending on what coverage/effect I want. But @MACCosmetics Studio Fix for when I want a matte full coverage, Face&Body for when I want a fresh dewy glow, Prolongwear when I am going to be out and about all day - it helps control oil and lasts ages!
2732 2018-09-03 18:13:27 Libya also has a lot of oil but riddled with problems nnot something I want to argue that they want to destabilize then steal oil, it's and old gimmick
2733 2018-09-03 18:13:20 baby oil ain’t for babies, the irony
2734 2018-09-03 18:13:13 Get yourself a man who randomly tells you he appreciates you, buys massage oil, and watches how-to vids on youtube so he can rub you better after your neck and shoulders have been fuckered up for days. THAT is romance, my friends. OH, and he totally buys me donuts, too.

2737 2018-09-03 18:12:53 You can still trade with Scotland after brexit and Scottish Independence.
Assuming you still want supplies of fresh water, electricity and oil ... and to eat of course.
Trade with Scotland keeps millions of jobs going in rUK; and, keeps your prices down and key resources secure.
2738 2018-09-03 18:12:46 Pani? Ki trah sharab ,honey ,olive oil , b bebu bezaiqa aur berang hote hein? pakistani doctors and police ???
2739 2018-09-03 18:12:41 Javed sb, if it was really honey and Olive oil, why he denied ownership of these bottles?
2740 2018-09-03 18:12:36 Lmao. Put tea tree oil on it. It’ll sooth it and help it go away ASAP.
2741 2018-09-03 18:12:33 I’ve had to take all kinds of classes about “preserving her culture.” Her culture is gonna be South Mississippi. She’s gonna wear flip flops and try to sneak beer out of my fridge as a teenager, and I’m going to have to run off aspiring young rednecks in Z71 pickup trucks.
2742 2018-09-03 18:12:30 No, that's not the key question. The key question is why did Gadhafi use his (mostly) mercenary army on the protesters right away. The larger key question is why didn't Gadhafi build out an institutional foundation so more Libyans could benefit from the NOC's oil production.
2743 2018-09-03 18:12:25 My peppermint oil is amazing, it’ll have ya entire head tingling after a wash n go 
2744 2018-09-03 18:12:24 เป็นกระหรี่มากกว่าที่คุณคิด ชอบว่ะ
2745 2018-09-03 18:12:20 Go and tell that to the engineers building bridges or designing aircraft, cranes, ships etc.
You do know that measuring gravity is a separate branch of science in it's own right? Micro variations are used to locate oil and mineral reserves and predict local tides.
2746 2018-09-03 18:12:12 Exactly!! u cud criticize ppp on A Lot of things, but they faced Highest oil prices, economic recession of 2008-9 in addition to the plague of terrorism, and managed to keep the CAD below what its today. Dar shud b placed in econ books as the worst handler EVER.
2747 2018-09-03 18:12:12 Whale oil lamps lighting up above Fox executives’ heads.
2748 2018-09-03 18:12:08 Just lathered my entire body in coconut oil. Whew ereng glow mo child?! 
2749 2018-09-03 18:12:01 im drinking the snake oil, i got multivitamins im buying into it no one can stop me!!!!!!!!!! i will not get scurvy!!!!!!!!!
2750 2018-09-03 18:12:01 Nobody wants your dirty oil. #LeaveItInTheGround
2751 2018-09-03 18:11:57 Yet again Zardari s money talked& bullshit walked. Shaljeel memon when tested had no alcohol in his system & of course in the alcohol decanter it was only honey ! Which asshole would spend hours to wash , dry & pour alcohol in a whisky decanter? Pour olive oil in a vodka bottle !
2752 2018-09-03 18:11:56 Oil changed, interior cleaned, now car wash time 
2753 2018-09-03 18:11:55 @SalooDurrani If the bottles contain honey and Olive oil, why he denied their ownership?
2754 2018-09-03 18:11:45 sunog na olive oil with matching bubbles
2755 2018-09-03 18:11:42 At the end of the day, NASS would have to override the president, if they are serious about reforming the oil and gas sector.
2756 2018-09-03 18:11:33 These are special bottels of Honey and Oil only used in Sindh and not anywhere in the globe 
2757 2018-09-03 18:11:21 School struck oil or the toga party
2758 2018-09-03 18:11:20 Crude oil
2759 2018-09-03 18:11:16 Black gold, you know it's true - and then came along a Man named Jed - Clampett was the name, oil was his game
2760 2018-09-03 18:10:57 @narendramodi is ending up like a FOOL. taking no bribe is good, but is not of much use, if you do not know what is th right thing to do.
not a single rascal has been punished in 4 years. @BJP4India is a GANDU party. they will loose 2019.
pinned hope on kejdibaal/modi both failed
2761 2018-09-03 18:10:48 We live & work in a global economy not a closed box where we refine & use only our own oil. It doesn’t work that way. We need strong  Leadership that takes us into the future with a well planned out diversified energy mix. Yes, oil will be a big part of it.
2762 2018-09-03 18:10:45 Mati ullah bhai. Hope u don't say that honey and olive oil were planted by khalai makhlook in Sharjeel Memon's 5 star sub jail
2763 2018-09-03 18:10:35 As somebody going through the process of adopting a little girl that will look a lot different from me, this just pisses me off to no end.
2764 2018-09-03 18:10:22 @narendramodi Sir, the nation is rattled by the oil price increase...can you feel it Sir???
2765 2018-09-03 18:10:20 ＢＢの変装は本当にすごいぜ！やっぱベテランだけあるよなー！
2766 2018-09-03 18:10:20 It is still a shame that the sewage waters untreated is pumped into lakes and rivers. Water will be the next oil. Countries like India will suffer the deepest, for there is no sense of respect for water !
2767 2018-09-03 18:10:14 RT @LivingSafely: Eating Propyl Alcohol this September? Used as a synthetic flavoring, it's made from natural gas and fusel oil.

2770 2018-09-03 18:10:07 That’s the beard oil I use. I got it on Amazon
2771 2018-09-03 18:10:06 Doing well but rubbed an ulcer in his eye in recovery. Allowed up for five minutes every so often but considering is doing very well. Stitches out next Thursday. Next day we have to get Katie to Exeter University and, Ben starts his new job in TV Film on the Monday. Busy time !
2772 2018-09-03 18:10:05 今日午後からゲリラサラダ油来るらしいよ。
2773 2018-09-03 18:10:04 When the prices of oil and other products goes up, it hits us hard all as Kenyans. 
Doesn't favor or choose who you voted for.

2774 2018-09-03 18:09:59 Privilege to baptize and confirm John and Liam at St Barnabas Worcester yesterday. Lots of water, anointing oil, faith and joy. Met someone I had not seen since 1971 when we were students @StJohnsDurham
2775 2018-09-03 18:09:56 It's disrespectful to fry plantain with reused oil.
2776 2018-09-03 18:09:48 How is fuel prices an issue in Kenya when we are oil producers??? This fact is mind boggling!!:-/:-/:-/:S..
2777 2018-09-03 18:09:41 And who will Add Inflation (Rupee Value) & Who will justify 2 Lac Crore Oil Bond Bill Pendency ?
2778 2018-09-03 18:09:41 Don't forget the homeless, MS-13, Big Pharmaceutical raping Americans, Big Oil raising gas prices, food more expensive than ever before, Rest home scandals, millions losing their or cannot afford the rising cost of health care, to name a few other concerns.
2779 2018-09-03 18:09:30 Oil change and a lil groceries!!!!! 
2780 2018-09-03 18:09:18 World Heavy Oil Congress and Exhibition (WHOCE) began today in Muscat, with the participation of international experts to discuss the future of energy sector.
2781 2018-09-03 18:09:12 Trinidad and Tobago got oil but their greedy and lazy politicans messing up their growth .
2782 2018-09-03 18:09:06 I know this sounds adult af but I think I found my new fav oil change spot
2783 2018-09-03 18:09:06 @deeyaego look like straight olive oil
2784 2018-09-03 18:09:05 @UmaruSanda the economy is on time bomb and we can't sit aloof thinking everything is well, a lot of Oil Marketing Companies are in serious debts but the public is not aware. @NAkufoAddo govt is failing Ghanaians. #NeverAgain @faridaShaibu @Citi973 #CitiNewsroom
2785 2018-09-03 18:09:02 It is most certainly sancho season lol. I've seen like 4 girls with different dudes out here  
Reason #1 why I would never take a oil rig job lol
2786 2018-09-03 18:09:02 Oil leak cured on the BMW, brakes fecked on the land rover.........that's how I roll on a Monday!!! #stopcomplainingman #getonwithit
2787 2018-09-03 18:08:55 Panda jee sharab ki bottlo mai kon pagal yeh honey or oil dalta. Logical bat kro koi
2788 2018-09-03 18:08:42 Canada does need to diversify from its dependence on oil and on automobiles.  Unfortunately, much of our promising technology often gets scooped up by the USA. One has only to look at Bombardier as a failure to retain Canadian technology and the associated investment.
2789 2018-09-03 18:08:38 Soros is a native Esperanto speaker who made a shit ton of money on currency speculation and gives money to liberal causes. The Koch brothers made money on oil and paper and such and give money to Republicans
2790 2018-09-03 18:08:38 Connecticut: credit industry Alaska:oil industry Maryland: federal workers
2791 2018-09-03 18:08:27 Another day of oil price rise, another day of pain for the government. This may make the elections next year a closer contest than it should be!
2792 2018-09-03 18:08:24 So I’m guess dudes don’t believe in putting on some lotion or baby oil on they dick?  ashy ass muthafucka

2794 2018-09-03 18:08:17 Scrub your lips with a concoction of   brown sugar(or just sugar/coffee ) and sheer butter or olive oil...
2795 2018-09-03 18:08:09 These are special bottels of Honey and Oil only used in Sindh and not anywhere in the globe 
2796 2018-09-03 18:07:57 The best engine in the world is the vagina.

It takes any size piston, is self lubricating, starts with one finger & every 4 weeks does its own oil change.

It's just a pity the management system is so fucking temperamental.
2797 2018-09-03 18:07:39 well unlike the PPP gov they were quite lucky on the external front. Oil prices also gave them a lot of FX leeway but they couldnt make use of it.
2798 2018-09-03 18:06:52 Maybe before the Oil Deep State bought off conservatives everywhere!
2799 2018-09-03 18:06:48 The voters of my country r clowns , politicians r jokers and rule of law is fraud, what a joke , honey and oil in wine bottles
2800 2018-09-03 18:06:46 Only managed two runs on Saturday due to problems with oil leak and then ignition packing up. Still, working to solve it in time for Doune in a few days! Gotta love old cars...
2801 2018-09-03 18:06:42 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines
2802 2018-09-03 18:06:33 @CBCTheGoods no no no canola oil is not healthy!!!! Please revisit!!
2803 2018-09-03 18:06:30 I know Trace Ellis Ross smells like coconut oil and lavender.
2804 2018-09-03 18:06:11 كله بقي بيلف ع كله الدوغري ده نلاقية فين
2805 2018-09-03 18:06:05 hell yeah the friendliest boys right here, i’ll make sure to say what’s up after the next gig!
2806 2018-09-03 18:05:49 My first car was a (2nd hand) Mini 1275GT - the gearbox fell out on the M40. Next was a new Metro - it leaked like a sieve and consumed oil like a drunk on a massive bender. Around the same time my father had a Rover SD1; it also leaked. Then a brake failure ended that for a BMW.
2807 2018-09-03 18:05:41 Recently read that coconut oil is “pure poison”, but that looks goood!
2808 2018-09-03 18:05:39 I’ve had PTSD since I was five. I use pot oil. It’s works. Write your Congress to have federally legalized.
2809 2018-09-03 18:05:31 Let me put it into words that a six year old will understand. The area that holds the oil sands is basically a reservoir that didn’t close up, hence ‘spilling’ over the land over millions of years. Bitumen seeps out of the ground naturally. Capiche?
2810 2018-09-03 18:05:21 Nearly got spray in the face with hydraulic oil, top Notch!
2811 2018-09-03 18:05:20 I was at the car dealer getting my oil changed this morning and I'm pretty sure they played @johnmayer's new song New Light! I got up trying to find a better speaker because the tv was loud. People were probably wondering what I was doing.  
2812 2018-09-03 18:05:11 RT @LivingSafely: Eating Propyl Alcohol this September? Used as a synthetic flavoring, it's made from natural gas and fusel oil.
2813 2018-09-03 18:05:05 I predict a ‘hero’ shall arrive from China and ‘save’ wananchi from oppressive oil prices. These scripts write themselves.
2814 2018-09-03 18:05:00 Tanker traffic is peaking in the lower mainland right now because of increasing local demand for IMPORTED oil. But better OPEC and Russia get rich than even one more cent to dirty, evil, capitalist Alberta. Am I right?
2815 2018-09-03 18:04:56 Bring rope when you visit. Also I might just order lots of Shibari rope. And wax candles + baby oil. And hmmmm what else... something to do with tickling probably.
2816 2018-09-03 18:04:36 The consumers never get the benefit of the crude oil prices. We just keep bearing the burden no matter what.
2817 2018-09-03 18:04:32 Its not that it is affected by crude oil only.. Many other factor also affect the $ to ₹.
2818 2018-09-03 18:04:31 Oil resource? Attack missile se huna hai k generade chalega?
2819 2018-09-03 18:04:25 If I feel like I’m going to lose my cool I just put in time on my Speed bag and pretend it’s their face.
2820 2018-09-03 18:03:59 How is the poorly Barny doing?  Up and about and having lots of attention?
2821 2018-09-03 18:03:54 Rivers indigens are eating oil money
2822 2018-09-03 18:03:50 Suave presentation by @palkisu of @WIONews exploring Matrix of Religion in Gravitas. Must watch by everyone . But does her summation that more religious  states are - more poorer they are

Saudi is 100% Islamic but also rich - just bcoz of oil
2823 2018-09-03 18:03:50 Since when oil changes take a while damn hour I’m tired 
2824 2018-09-03 18:03:48 Sirji, I live in a oil producing region of Canada. I pay C$1.28/liter = Inr 70 /kg. We are not subsidized. How do Indians feel that they, a net oil importing country need to pay LESS or EQUAL than an Oil producing country? What logic is that?
2825 2018-09-03 18:03:31 Darcy is so over dramatic, stop trying to make oil and water mix #90DayFiance
2826 2018-09-03 18:03:30 Oil is an excellent carrier for bacteria. It’s not recommended as lube. Coconut oil also clogs pores. If you like it go ahead and do what you want with your own body but know that there’s risks.

2828 2018-09-03 18:03:14 Evangelicals are CINO's (Christians in Name Only). People that truly believe in God cannot be Pro-Life and Pro-War. Trump is promoting their agenda to foster their belief on those that don't believe the way they do. A snake oil salesman that wants votes.
2829 2018-09-03 18:03:11 The govt should not back off especially on our defense and oil needs.
2830 2018-09-03 18:03:05 I am co-chair of the citizens committee that lobbied the government to remove this oil. Thank you so very much! We are so pleased with how well this has gone and the professionalism of Ardent's team. After five years of pushing for this, mid-September can't come soon enough!
2831 2018-09-03 18:03:04 You’re right everybody hair is different . I’ll give it a few more weeks with this oil I just got . If it doesn’t work , I’ll be your first customer.
2832 2018-09-03 18:03:01 I hate pumping gas & getting oil changes. I just need a bike.
2833 2018-09-03 18:02:56 Congratulations. But forgive me for sounding disappointed. With all the oil money, History of Art is what you can bring from a UK university? How will that help Nigeria and your fellow Nigerians? Just a thought that crossed my mind.
2834 2018-09-03 18:02:54 Oil minister is novice... And certainly doesn't deserve to be at this place....
2835 2018-09-03 18:02:32 Hey Melvin obummer was a snake oil salesman that the mainstream media and gave a carte blanc too
2836 2018-09-03 18:02:21 We have this sack of protoplasm saying Australia is ripe for populist "revolution" and Bad Boy Brexit himself Farrage on a speaking tour here. Not content with shitting in the own nests they're shitting in mine. We were already good for snakes and for sellers of oil from snakes
2837 2018-09-03 18:02:20 Wrap it up in your own clothes/bubble wrap and it might be alright? My mom flew to the us with olive oil, honey and various jars of jam and it was alright
2838 2018-09-03 18:02:19 Anyone catch this little tidbit? "The town of 55,000 (PA) includes the Saudi-controlled Motiva oil refinery, the nation's largest"   Oh HELL no!!!
2839 2018-09-03 18:02:10 Like honey and olive oil bottle 
2840 2018-09-03 18:02:10 High fuel prices despite low crude oil price is very distrubing & will perhaps be a single reason for the downfall of the govt. Taking people for granted a little too much? @narendramodi @dpradhanbjp @arunjaitley #FuelPriceHike
2841 2018-09-03 18:02:07 Don't forget colluding with the Saudis in 2014 to crash oil prices to exasparate Dutch disease in Venezuela

So where do I start! Have a transit Motor home 18mths old only done 3000 miles had no problem, then in july had recall for injectors so had them fitted got home then had a massive oil leak caused by Ford poor workmanship. Then new injectors failed livid !!!!
2844 2018-09-03 18:02:00 I’ve got to have some brocolli and sesame oil. Like right now!

"Jeez - yer no oil paintin' yerself!"
2848 2018-09-03 18:01:52 The deficit fell about 200 million USD in 2009 due to OIL.

2851 2018-09-03 18:01:40 over the weekend I made homemade cannolis (hold for applause) and after frying about 30 of them in a pot of canola oil, the entire house felt like it was an aquarium of oil and I was Octopus trying to escape
2852 2018-09-03 18:01:26 The oil companies never lose! They're too powerful and they refine 70% of our fuel. The wording of the announcement suggests govt is taking the hit.
2853 2018-09-03 18:01:25 As one who uses a lot of olive oil, I can get in line with this!
2854 2018-09-03 18:01:12 Your $9.99 Oil change species are great, & like always the service & service writers were great also.  Thanks for everything y’all do.
2855 2018-09-03 18:01:09 What if the crude oil touches 80$ in international market.  How much will Indian government charge us in that case???

2857 2018-09-03 18:01:00 Oil change in a few before hitting the clock 
2858 2018-09-03 18:00:56 Yes i totally with you.

The rise in oil puts life in trouble.

Facing all time low in fall of rupee.

Govt must step in to control the inflation
2859 2018-09-03 18:00:48 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @SecretaryPerry Can't our oil refineries just make one blend of gasoline that would work for all areas of the country all year round? Wouldn't that make gasoline cheaper?

2868 2018-09-03 17:59:56 Woohoo that worked!!! Thank you!  

Oh and we’re going to be tackling the issue of palm oil (our topic is rainforests)
2869 2018-09-03 17:59:52 My advice for you is contact your local MP and tell him (her?) you have a moral objection to oil and therefore would no longer wish to receive transfer payments that have been generated from oil companies.
2870 2018-09-03 17:59:45 My boyfriend asked which essential oil I was wearing & I told him thinking he was being thoughtful & he scrunched his face up & said “yucky”
2871 2018-09-03 17:59:44 Many want back in, yes, but Trump is NOT the solution. He is a snake oil salesman, an ungodly anti-intellectual bully that has taken this country on a disastrous path. I hope we can survive his madness.
2872 2018-09-03 17:59:28 #FuelOnFire I appreciate Mr @nitin_gadkari who advocated for an aggressive shift to #ElectricVehicles - had GoI supported with full force, things wouldn't have gone this bad. Most disappointing response was from oil companies!!
Cc @narendramodi @teraptor
2873 2018-09-03 17:59:16 the only essential oil is olive
2874 2018-09-03 17:59:06 So Mr Demon, that's my exact point
When US$ rate against Re. is almost same during
2013-2018. During 2013 one barrel of crude oil was at 140$ the price of petrol are almost same as in 2013 & in 2018.(BTW today 1 barrel of crude oil costs Max. 75$.)
2875 2018-09-03 17:59:03 Went to the drugstore yesterday. Next to the teatree oil I spotted some multivitamin/ B vitamin liquids they advertised as booster to combat tiredness. I checked the labeling for B12. It said one dose contains 20000% of the recommended daily dose. Jeezem.

2876 2018-09-03 17:58:50 Olive oil is serious business in this house 
2877 2018-09-03 17:58:43 @SSFineArts , Good day . I have several pieces of work that I am trying to evaluate and market , I shall forward shortly.
1- Copper work by O. Parker Black.
2- water color by Davis Gray , Fulton on the Hudson.
3- Oil on Canvas (Very old) by Costello,
Boat on beach next to house
2878 2018-09-03 17:58:28 I motor oil in a fucking tin can old.
2879 2018-09-03 17:58:27 My most recent use was coconut oil in Pito Boi's water (my cat) and got rid of worms. It's been a full week and no fucking worms. Gross I know but these out door cats hunni groom each other it's a thing 
2880 2018-09-03 17:58:13 Castor oil is rich in ricinoleic acid thus helps elastin & collagen production. However it's a laxative & can also induce nausea thus orally it should be given only on strict recommendation.
2881 2018-09-03 17:58:05 @BFT_Podcast  cogent analysis of politics today the way only a game show host and a snake oil salesman can bring it to ya.
2882 2018-09-03 17:57:45 Suitcase full of origano & olive oil yet???  @annakyklosis
2883 2018-09-03 17:57:34 Oddly enough my grandson was born with Eczema. Poor little thing looked like he had been burnt up. I have 6 children all grown had never seen a child BORN with it. MY Daughter who makes healing soaps & oils, researched it and made oil, soap & body butter for him. He's 5 now & NPs
2884 2018-09-03 17:57:33 And... and here is the kicker... we are not lowering anything. We are mass importing Saudi oil, refining it out east, amd moving it across the country by rail and truck.

We should be mining our own, refining our own and have a country spanning pipeline.

2891 2018-09-03 17:57:07 I agree with the Ken's letter to the editor, except I don't get his comparison of the Gulf oil spill and Katrina.
2892 2018-09-03 17:57:07 Says the heavy faced oil drenced arm pitt, slack jawed  paid for liar. I prefer my liars to at least look good while lying. Even at that trump fails. Can't get any nice looking people to work for him. All he can get is rode hard Kellyanne and demented rudi with horse teeth. Sad.
2893 2018-09-03 17:57:06 Thanks, it was their home, they lived in a branch that fell last storm. They aren't aggressive apparently, hubby is going to cover them for this storm. I don't have lemongrass oil. I have lemon and lime oils. We have fruit tea or lemonade or would raw honey work?
2894 2018-09-03 17:57:06 Tony grinned, glad that she took the obvious hint. He began to peel off to join her.

“Yes, you can. In fact, I insist you do it so we don’t ruin the bikini fabric with this oil.”

Ever practical. Very smooth, Tony.
2895 2018-09-03 17:56:58 Sod’s law. I had a problem with my automatic gearbox, which I was hoping didn’t mean I needed a new one. Oil change seems to have corrected the fault (so far) 
2896 2018-09-03 17:56:55 Although other capital intensive industries in Canada -- such as construction and manufacturing -- gear investment to oil.  But either way makes the point that we have a real shortage of investment in Canada (which makes the impact of oil decline bigger).
2897 2018-09-03 17:56:53 choti: mre face pr bht oil ata h ab

2898 2018-09-03 17:56:52 Extremism is pumping oil and destroying the planet.
2899 2018-09-03 17:56:47 Guaranteed every time I post something about Rape Seed oil I get a DM from someone outside the UK thinking it’s either outrageous or hilarious..
2900 2018-09-03 17:56:38 When the majority of our oil supplies transited thru the Persian Gulf there was good reason to keep sea lanes open. Not as much now that we are much more energy self sufficient. Nevertheless we will always need protection from missile attack.
2901 2018-09-03 17:56:27 if u don't giggle when u see "extra virgin" olive oil at the store then ur a narc
2902 2018-09-03 17:56:26 Why the govt is so greedy to bring crude oil under GST, when it did hook or crook to bring GST ?
2903 2018-09-03 17:56:25 I made one which smells amazing - apricot kernel oil base with rose geranium, rose, sweet orange, lemon, rosemary. Smells like Turkish delight. I use it for leg pain flares, usually on my thighs with a spiky massage ball.
2904 2018-09-03 17:56:23 I thought I was hallucinating...but no, there is actually a giant bottle of engine oil on the roof.
2905 2018-09-03 17:56:11 Coconut oil is good for the skin, hair, and beard..
2906 2018-09-03 17:56:05 Anything that makes oil biz difficult and expensive is great.
2907 2018-09-03 17:55:47 Coconut oil, jojoba, hemp oil, or neem oil. I’ll send you this company only that’s good for her hair
2908 2018-09-03 17:55:45 Currency will be the same one they buy or goods with ie whisky, gin, sea food, Scottish game, Scottish haggis O and oil and gas and electricity that England will have to buy from us as for deficit how can there be one? Scotland has never borrowed any money so explain that one
2909 2018-09-03 17:55:42 Every once in awhile I get a project handed to me from Grace. This one was nice. Bringing life back to an old school desk. Was really rusted and the wood really needed quite a bit of sanding. But overall a little paint, oil and a lot of elbow grease... Results seen...
2910 2018-09-03 17:55:35 Two things I can't live 
without in life are: 

Coconut oil
@DrBronner castile soap
2911 2018-09-03 17:55:19 well thats one way to put fish oil in ur cats food 
2912 2018-09-03 17:55:04 Anything that make oil industry difficult and expensive is great.
2913 2018-09-03 17:54:57 All the more reason for municipalities to start using Sierra Energy's technology for 1. clearing landfills, 2. generating electricity,  3. recovering trillions of gallons of oil, 4.making aggregates, 5. recovering metals.  The process is non polluting and economic
2914 2018-09-03 17:54:54 What a surprise! If Trump blows up NAFTA, the US might have to buy oil from Putin's Russia. If you accept that Trump is being controlled by Putin then a lot of the craziness starts to make sense.

2916 2018-09-03 17:54:51 You're getting a $100 million/day discount on our oil and then selling yours at world prices.  Take it out if that slush fund.  Tides is donating to activist douchebags to kill our energy program.
2917 2018-09-03 17:54:47 The ultimate con man snake oil salesman.  Trump's supporters can't admit they were wrong. Sad.
2918 2018-09-03 17:54:35 Baba the thing pain me ,na only cry I no cry 
2919 2018-09-03 17:54:16 The tax revenue increased not bcz Pmln were good, but bcz they got lucky. Oil prices went down frm $110 to arnd $40/bbl, for much of their tenure. They didnt pass on ths relief to th public, but instead increased the taxation on oil, hence the doubled revenue, plus Inflation help
2920 2018-09-03 17:54:00 Didn’t. I made a sludge. 

Olive oil and enough seasoning (garlic, paprika garlic, salt, pepper, etc.) to make it a thick sludge, painted it on and then threw it on the grill.

2923 2018-09-03 17:53:47 You cannot continually invade other countries and destabilize them to further American oil interests and be respected. You are not defending “freedom”.
2924 2018-09-03 17:53:45 If Oil spikes, Argentina has a Low Currency, lots of Debt in Pesos. Finding Heavy Oil by the increments of $100 Million that has 10X potential is why they went to LATAM in first place. Operationally, they can do it. Finances not until something changes. That is the play now. CZR
2925 2018-09-03 17:53:42 Would you rather have Oil consumption or Systems and methods are disclosed to for detecting movement of an object?
2926 2018-09-03 17:53:37 And if that doesn’t work they also said that putting a few drops of extra virgin olive oil in your ears before bed can help if you do it for a few days

2929 2018-09-03 17:53:24 The domestic airfares in India are low because of the low cost carriers like Indigo, SpiceJet and Go Air. Full service carriers like Air India, Jet Airways and Vistara have to match their low fares, which are not sustainable due to rising oil prices and falling Rupee.
2930 2018-09-03 17:53:20 i have and put tea tree oil on it so i hope it’ll de-scab and heal again soon :((
2931 2018-09-03 17:53:16 A mí me quieren cocer a impuestos con el tema de la contaminación y el gas oil pero él se permite los 5.000 euros por hora que cuesta la fiesta en vez de pillarse un coche eléctrico pero así luego no luce tanto para la foto.
2932 2018-09-03 17:53:10 Certainly was not trying to elevate this clown to your level. It's like oil and water :-)
2933 2018-09-03 17:53:03 @UKenyatta he’s playing a a dirty game, creating a mess,clean it and then congratulate himself how well he’s done after sorting out his own mess #Ushenzi. Crude oil should determine the price of fuel NOT individual in government,only in a Rogue State this happens.
2934 2018-09-03 17:53:02 Yes, it's definitely a tradeoff, but better a shock than a generation. 

/Especially because we won't purge the oil company.  Again.
2935 2018-09-03 17:52:48 Dude.. US Middle Eastern Policy started in the 1950's through agreement like Hussein-McMahon, Balfour Agreement, etc.  It essentially made the US economy entirely dependent on oil.  That is atrocious and we need to get out through sound environmental energy policy
2936 2018-09-03 17:52:45 If you pay attention to details you will find out that her point is sustainability based of Debt 2 Revenue. Pls, focus on that, using data @firsNigeria our non oil revenue surpases targets, tax base increasing, yes we can do better and must. The outlook to me is positive.
2937 2018-09-03 17:52:36 Allah Sarki A.B.U ... I miss my Alma Mata
2938 2018-09-03 17:52:26 It's oil like so I don't know.
2939 2018-09-03 17:52:09 I really went back home because I forgot to put on lavender oil
2940 2018-09-03 17:52:08 But 2 million EVs would reduce demand by an equal amount OPEC cut which means OPEC will need to cut more. Read the headlines... record EVs month after month. Will only be another year or 2 before another major oil price collapse. And it won’t recover this time
2941 2018-09-03 17:52:04 Not to be super nostalgic...Ice Cube’s Amerikkka’s Most Wanted and me chanting, “no blood for oil” came out in 1990. Timeless releases.
2942 2018-09-03 17:52:03 TRUST: : belief that someone or something is reliable, good, honest, and effective. 

Let us consider this in 2019 election not just rice and groundnut oil....

2944 2018-09-03 17:52:02 The doctor told me to pour boiling water into a bowl and put a drop of tea tree oil in it, then sit with my head under a towel over the bowl, apparently the steam helps

#SharjeelMemon
2952 2018-09-03 17:51:10 Yeah getting your heart broken sucks and all, but have you ever had the oil pop and have it land on your arm. Shit hurts like a MoFo
2953 2018-09-03 17:51:04 and we took two classes taught by him
2954 2018-09-03 17:50:56 Oil paint takes 3 full days to dry on canvas. I'm selling this next piece for $50,000. I'm worth it, if you can't afford it don't @ me.
2955 2018-09-03 17:50:56 The 2022 Warrants would be in-the-money at $1.05 the reduction in share count and warrant count happens tomorrow for PentaNova/CruzSur. Can they resolve the disputes get the oil flowing and create a new heavy oil co. in Argentina? It's a risky play until all issues are resolved.
2956 2018-09-03 17:50:32 Unlikely due to more challenging ice conditions + shorter season, shallower waters, less distance savings, no multibillion $ oil/gas dev along route, no major intl. investments.
2957 2018-09-03 17:50:28 Don't forget the super secret Jabba dabba ..the exotic mixture poured into the wellhead that makes oil impossible to pull from the ground. And of course operation pocket change..weaponizing currency so when they pull it from their wallets it disappears in a cloud of laughing gas
2958 2018-09-03 17:50:24 I havent joined the military because I dont wanna help kill brown people in the desert for oil and profit.
2959 2018-09-03 17:50:22 Not illegally as you well know. But let me guess..... the uber capitalist banksters under the guidance of their Zionist masters and oil corporations. Come and see the violence inherent in the system help help I’m being repressed
2960 2018-09-03 17:50:22 Nobody warned me that keto dieting would do something insane to my GI tract and cause me to poop so much even without going near MCT oil 
2961 2018-09-03 17:50:15 Ok if China demand falls how does oil get to $80...because producers aren’t pumping enough even to meet slowing demand
2962 2018-09-03 17:50:13 Really.. so Buffett’s trains number one product is oil transportation. Much of Berkshire portfolio is at risk from renewable energy and transport. The rest is crappy food and criminal banks. $wfc #dairyqueen
2963 2018-09-03 17:50:10 Why the govt is so greedy to bring crude oil under GST, when it did hook or crook to bring GST ?
2964 2018-09-03 17:50:07 Market price moving? Huh? It dropped cause there was an oversupply of oil. The only reason Alberta and most western oil companies survived was because OPEC agreed to cut production

2969 2018-09-03 17:49:12 Speaking of dinner; I've some really nice pork chops to put in the oven.
Simple prep. A little olive oil, then seasoned with salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder, and some paprika.

Cooking keeps me grounded.
2970 2018-09-03 17:49:05 Hi Jonathan,

Correct me if I’m wrong, but I believe your footballing affiliations are with Aberdeen. 
Have you ever voiced any concerns over the direct & indirect influence of the North Sea Oil Industry on your club, City & Country?
2971 2018-09-03 17:48:59 Take your dirty oil money and get out! #MAGA
2972 2018-09-03 17:48:59 yep. but we can make it one side -- send Big Oil to hell. then work on the rest :-)
2973 2018-09-03 17:48:47 The way man United is going down they will soon discover oil
2974 2018-09-03 17:48:34 You know what else would’ve caused low oil prices? A prolonged depression.
2975 2018-09-03 17:48:29 Good spot Tony !! Great news.

2979 2018-09-03 17:48:18 Tell Modi to take care of oil price and falling rupee. Economy ki band baja diya.
2980 2018-09-03 17:48:09 Why did your  state govt increase fuel surcharges when the price is already high?  To share this series of ill-informed tweets? Pls see the currency fluctuations and oil production.  Try to educate your self.
2981 2018-09-03 17:47:57 Ugh that ugly last pic the OIL
2982 2018-09-03 17:47:49 Putting oil and honey in liquor bottles = zardari/NS aren't corrupt
2983 2018-09-03 17:47:48 If CruzSur focuses exclusively on Low Sulphur Heavy Oil, the Argentina assets are raw ground with proven production and rapid scale up, could go from zero to 50,000 BBLs in less than 5 years. With Billions BBls in Reserves potentially. Not for everyone, but the play is Heavy Oil.
2984 2018-09-03 17:47:48 Watch it dude  inini I watched it ..and honestly the way those guys were doing it , you would think they gay and I think they put like oil or Vaseline .its actually deep 
2985 2018-09-03 17:47:45 But extramarital relations, violence and exploitation are in line with Pakistani culture 
2986 2018-09-03 17:47:33 I think if I had a line of motor oil, I'd call it "craft motor oil" and tell people it had an oak barrel finish.
2987 2018-09-03 17:47:08 Perhaps the reason Bernie bashed the Dem party is because they deserve it. And before y’all go crazy, I’ve been a voting Dem for 36 years. If the Dem Establishment is so great, why didn’t they raise min wage to inflation when they had Congress & WH? Fracking, oil, pharma etc etc

I am working mechanical supervisor (PTW)

I experience 1.4 year in oil and gas field in Oman . and you can get all details in my resume
2991 2018-09-03 17:46:29 I guess my first time for an oil change at @NTB will be my last time.  It shouldn't take an hour especially when you schedule your time online. I could have been in and out at @ExpressOil even without an appointment in less than 15 minutes. #NotWorthTheSavings
2992 2018-09-03 17:46:27 I have fish oil and garlic pills will that work?
2993 2018-09-03 17:46:18 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
2994 2018-09-03 17:46:11 @HollyEllyatt your piece on oil...speculatively incorrect. If you look at the near term transportation in China & India will require more fuel which will not be replaced by electrical vehicles powered through utilities using NG. Very short term a recession there might slow demand
2995 2018-09-03 17:46:11 @narendramodi Rising crude oil prices are making impossible for the transportation Industry to survive.  Company rates are stagnant but other costs are increasing like anything. The transportation Industry is working without profits.  Thats the bitter truth. @PetroleumMin
2996 2018-09-03 17:45:56 @KlasraRauf @AmirMateen2 @NaeemBokharii @Waqas_amjad cant understand Rauf and Mateen ( Hackel and Jackel). Last 5 programs r on Manika and against IK.

3015 2018-09-03 17:43:57 Greenpeace does care about Canadian jobs? How many have they created vs. Destroyed? You’ve obviously never left your crystal palace and seen how oil companies names are on hospitals, schools, rinks, senior centres, across western Canada small towns and First Nation communities.

3017 2018-09-03 17:43:31 Now i am wondering if some elf will find this thread and be confused what kangmin have to do anything with olive oil and honey in wine bottles lol
3018 2018-09-03 17:43:18 1. Dollars has been subsidized for more 15 years now. Meaning FG pays the half of every dollar you've earned since those years. 2. Oil price has been subsidized since, which means half of the money has been paid by FG. Now this government removed all that to save the waste.

3027 2018-09-03 17:42:31 What kind of a goofy statement is that Elizabeth, at the moment in time it would appear that Big Oil are the only ones that care about jobs. I would agree with you that the Greens should care, however I'm not convinced they do. Please convince me otherwise??
3028 2018-09-03 17:42:23 Only gold matters now! Any kind of currency is almost mute. We gave and they are still losing. (Sorry forgot Oil Futures) to the west. Really now either's only asset! Let them implode and we can buy them for a song before long!
3029 2018-09-03 17:42:09 And since, from an external perspective, Venezuela is a country that produces oil and some very, very light tourism, if they physically can't sell the oil, then they have nothing worth exporting and no ability to produce their needs internally. 

2018 is the best case scenario.
3030 2018-09-03 17:42:09 You need Canada for water, lumber and oil. So basically the necessities of living.
3031 2018-09-03 17:41:59 Good to see you opposing government's decision on oil price and Arnab Goswami also makes debate on that but liberals are saying @republic  is godi media and you as a sanghi. We as a citizen need this type of deabte not rafale deal debate which is unnecessary.
3032 2018-09-03 17:41:58 I need my oil change to hurry up.. I’m ready for a nap !
3033 2018-09-03 17:41:56 If oil goes below 70, a weaker rupee would only going to help economy further don't you think?

3035 2018-09-03 17:41:39 Last friday, #PentaNova MarketCap was $8.5 Million.
Last year they claimed $100MM of potential oil Assets.
Thats 10X what MCAP trades at today. 
To get to that $ value, would require CAPEX of
10's of Millions in Argentina by 2022. 
New #CruzSur shares open as CZR $0.35 tomorrow?

3047 2018-09-03 17:40:31 I used to manage a White Castle restaurant many, many years ago. I used to give our old oil to this nice man who had a Mercedes that ran on it. Try them or other fast food joints. It saves them money to just give it away.
3048 2018-09-03 17:40:23 No one told me rosehip oil smells THIS bad. Sobrang repulsive nia. Pero ugh para sa ikagaganda ng balat. Literal na #TIISGANDA

3050 2018-09-03 17:39:55 lemme tell y’all how I just got a free oil change and saved my lil $100.. they broke some piece and got a new one put on so they said don’t even worry about it. 
3051 2018-09-03 17:39:52 American fracking oil is clean and pure
Venezuelan oil isn't even a liquid.  

If they can't make peace with the American government before the refineries finish retooling to use fracking oil, no one will process their oil, and they won't have a customer base.
3052 2018-09-03 17:39:38 Hang on. You JUST FINISHED SAYING that Alberta should build a refinery and ship the finished product through Canada. Because there were more jobs in it. Which would be “Big Oil” creating Canadian jobs. You are arguing against your own point.
3053 2018-09-03 17:39:37 Do you not realize that at least as many good #jobs would be created if AB bitumen were refined there & replaced imported #oil while Canadians trained for work in renewable #energy and #pollution cleanup? #cdnpoli #economy
3054 2018-09-03 17:39:34 @realDonaldTrump The US government can and must make India cut off its oil completely from Iran. Iran's oil exports should reach zero by November 4, and there are no exemptions
3055 2018-09-03 17:39:33 The Thing is, deep down with all his wrong decisions lead by oil lobbyists, and all his whackyness Bush like his father did what he thought was best for the US. Compare that to the evil selfishness, the lack of moral that is Trump. Bush was bad, Trump is just Evil!
3056 2018-09-03 17:39:25 It's important to watch the trends.  If the trend holds in another 2 years growth demand will plateau.  They are putting trillions into renewable energy and electric buses.  How long before we hit global peak oil demand?  Just in time for 3 new oil pipelines we'll all lose $$ on.
3057 2018-09-03 17:39:18 Trying to bring back #Asbestus. Needed regulations turned back. Wanting to drill for oil on American beach’s. Breaking up families out of malice. Children in cages. Handing #Putin carte blanche. I could go on but what’s the point. This is what you call #MAGA #Republicans #Voter
3058 2018-09-03 17:39:17 We have more oil than you. Have fun defending against Russia.
3059 2018-09-03 17:39:13 Crude oil price is comparatively low
3060 2018-09-03 17:39:11 I deal with nerve pain also, try cbd oil! works for me.
3061 2018-09-03 17:39:09 @realDonaldTrump India does not have two more routes, or it will completely cut off its oil, or the Indian government will collapse. The US government is very kind to India, and this has tarnished India.
3062 2018-09-03 17:39:07 @sharjeelinam  he is not a poor person he can buy new bottles for honey and olive oil . I don't know why he only find Alcohol bottles for this could he not find any other suitable bottles. Clearly shows that sindh government try to save him . Fake reports
3063 2018-09-03 17:39:04 My lovely Asian friend who lives in the UK had to have 3 stents inserted before her 40th birthday. I used to watch her cook and couldn't believe how much oil they used and also how much rice they consumed even for breakfast. Both her mum and dad died of MI.
3064 2018-09-03 17:39:00 Truffle oil or "flavoring". 
3065 2018-09-03 17:38:40 Why is it so hard to get oil???
3066 2018-09-03 17:38:32 Top 4 emerging economies look soft:

Brazil: 4% inflation—Oil primary export rather than ideas
Russia: Strong exports very hard/scary to invest in via an ADR
India: 4.1% inflation, best one so far though
China: Trade war, strong dollar making oil expensive, growth slowing
3067 2018-09-03 17:38:14 I suffer from it,  too. I'm afraid to go to sleep,  fearful of the horrible nightmares. The side effects from meds were keeping me from participation in life. 

While I still trigger easily,  I found the most relief from using CBD oil.  

I pray this episode is over quickly for u

3072 2018-09-03 17:37:46 I've used olive oil.
3073 2018-09-03 17:37:40 กูเบื่อ....
กูทำไมงี่เง่าแบบนี้ว่ะ
3074 2018-09-03 17:37:23 there is an essential oil called smart & sassy, do I really need to encourage this behaviour even more w myself? yes, yes I do.
3075 2018-09-03 17:37:21 He visited sharjeel maiman in his hospital a day before,wine bottles were found from his room,he claimed it was honey & olive oil in wine bottles,today the report came that it really was oil and honey(im still suspicious lol)
3076 2018-09-03 17:37:20 Palm oil is ahead by leaps and bounds. But the key concern here is with global prices. No industry can afford to be sustainable when it's path is decided by commodity markets
3077 2018-09-03 17:37:20 Venezuela is doing badly due to the fall of the oil sector, Maduro's corruption, existing debt, the departure of companies from the region, Maduro's appointing of military officials in economic areas, and Maduro's idiotic decision to just "print more money"
3078 2018-09-03 17:37:14 An earthquake occurred directly on top of the Hibernia Oil Platform near St. John's Nova Scotia last night.  Unusual Oil slicks and lack of reports follow
3079 2018-09-03 17:37:08 @CJPSaqibNisar Even a lay man can distinguishe among Honey, Olive oil & Alcohol, But plz note how fearlessly truth is manipulated by police, doctors & lab personnel in a case directly dealt by u. This is how facts r manipulated in Pakistan. How will u give justice to common man ?
3080 2018-09-03 17:37:04 A displacement for now. Japan will source from others while China increases their purchases of Iran’s crude.  To bypass upcoming sanctions China has changed its purchasing strategy to buying Iran’s oil shipped and delivered on Iranian ships to Chinese ports.
3081 2018-09-03 17:36:59 @narendramodi Petrol price is boiling oil. Please do sum thing . Other wise it will onion effect last election lost. Now if no cut in price have to pay Hugh
3082 2018-09-03 17:36:56 @realDonaldTrump The US can make Iran's oil exports to zero, if it does not, it's unbearable and this is a kind of support for terrorism.All sectors in India should be banned, and tariffs against India should be heavier.filthy government of India needs to taste the real sanctions
3083 2018-09-03 17:36:55 If @RockstarGames decided to make a naval DLC, what vehicles and stuff do you think they will add to this DLC? A boat MOC? Aircraft Carrier? Oil Rig businesses? Battleships?

3085 2018-09-03 17:36:50 Now you can perhaps explain this spread sheet, I just do not know how to read it nor how it works.

I wonder how it works if the model 3 starts being pumped out as expected?  Is the charging network included as a asset?

How does value the Semi and that disruption?

Oil saved?

Temporarily no source of trading Cash Flow
The YPF legally fenced Llancelano
3088 2018-09-03 17:36:36 Hehehehe..well put. The question however remains that why the honey and olive oil were  kept in these bottles and not in their respective / original bottles 
3089 2018-09-03 17:36:28 Gore can't stand the Clintons -especially Hillary. 
Has the Clintons been present at the events mingling with the other past presidents? I haven't been keeping up with all of it.

Joke of the year
3091 2018-09-03 17:35:53 And, much of that proven high demand is discounted at well below world prices, processed in the US and exported at a higher price with profits going to US refiners. One interesting proposal would ship oil by rail to Alaska, then to foreign markets. Opportunity lost for Canada.
3092 2018-09-03 17:35:50 So, why do you need to change your car's oil anyway? Well, for starters, the oil picks up a lot of debris over time and essentially becomes dirty. Also, the oil actually breaks down eventually and becomes far less effective at lubricating the engine and carrying away heat.

3098 2018-09-03 17:35:05 Lol it’s ok. You don’t need to know anything to get your oil changed. Just get a second opinion from a trusted friend/family member who knows cars about any extra work
3099 2018-09-03 17:34:59 Who needs grabba, when you got nuff oil and shatter
3100 2018-09-03 17:34:43 Modi govt gave the privilege of price determining of petrol to oil companies which hugely favoured Ambani. and Adhani travels along Modi always. So this isn't just small favours. Bcoz they donated to relief fund, they are not above criticization. Thats what I meant.
3101 2018-09-03 17:34:36 Hennah, yogurt, coffee, whatever oil works well with your hair add it. I usually add coconut oil. Mix it together and put it on your hair for 2 hours and wash away! Btw it kinda changes the color of your hair lol

3110 2018-09-03 17:33:38 ... That mean each American burned through $300 million worth of natural capital with little to show for it."

So, $3/gallon gassoline is a fanticy also.  Our whole industrial revolution mentality of cheap oil can not continue.

IMHO, PV+Batteries can take the place of this lie.

3114 2018-09-03 17:33:11 How are they not socialist? They nationalized any privately held business that was successful and handed them to Chavez' supporters. Their oil fields failed multiple times because the morons who were in charge knew nothing about oil production (but a lot about siphoning money)
3115 2018-09-03 17:33:08 I heard there’s oil there

3122 2018-09-03 17:32:15 $TSLA $TSLAQ Bear’s talk about how small EV sales are compared to auto sales... Yet they assume this percentage is fixed as they see every new EV model as going to displace a Tesla not another ICE (big oil thinking)!  Bull’s welcome every new EV as they replace another ICE!
3123 2018-09-03 17:32:05 Honestly, I'm more worried about the Hispanic Americans that might happen to here than some people from the 1950's in a country we needlessly invaded for oil.

Sorry.
3124 2018-09-03 17:32:05 Twitter why in God’s name do you think I want ads about oil and gas companies do you know how many essays I’ve written about fracking
3125 2018-09-03 17:31:54 But we are talking about a sentient blow up doll with a bad hair piece glued to the top of his head after being spray-tanned and melted a bit. I refuse to call him a man. At best he's a snake oil salesman with a penchant for hatred and lies. (4)

3139 2018-09-03 17:29:50 Reminds me, I could've taken a job as a machinist at one of the oil refineries up in Benicia. Might still be open, Idunno.
3140 2018-09-03 17:29:46 Does it not make scientific sense to move oil by the safest way possible in light of increasing demand, not based on a speculative article published in January, 2017? Allowing prairie farmers to move grain by rail in the upcoming months seems like a plus for Canadian economy.

3149 2018-09-03 17:29:04 the west should separate but it won't be easy. Quebec will claim 10% of western oil (but west has no share of Quebec hydro revenue). Lawsuits galore. How you going to deal with Indian Reserves, treaties and national defense? It must happen but it will take strong leadership
3150 2018-09-03 17:29:04 Every one is making hue and cry for increase in oil price.Yes,I agree it is pinching but not like T.V anchor are shouting..Truth is although oil price is all time high but no less vehicles on the road , yesterday we are paying ®83 today ®85 in Mumbai  ®2extra.

3185 2018-09-03 17:26:02 Whatever! ! Chamche, patrol prices are always rise and gets low due to International prices as we are not producing any oil refinery.  
Don't spread fakr news like Modi is a failure when it comes to petrol prices. Tell the truth to the people of the country.  Why this is happeni?
3186 2018-09-03 17:26:00 Am sure there are ample brains to analyse this so-called complex pricing structure of crude oil - petrol puzzle and come up with a more rational structure that protects Govt revenues and is transparent enough for people to understand the pricing.

3190 2018-09-03 17:25:33 Butter, Ghee, VCO -- Best source of FAT.
Worse Source of FAT -- VEGAN PEE (they call it ghee) so only they can consume, Margarine, Saffola, CONola, Soy Oil, CRISCO -- all favorites of @HarvardChanSPH @HarvardHealth professors and of course the #HYPOCRITES @Peta and @PetaIndia
3191 2018-09-03 17:25:30 I’m so scared to do it bc I literally did this all in one sitting 2 weeks ago and the only thing that kept my hair from not falling out was bc of how naturally oily it is but the oil hasn’t built itself back up so I’m like :-)
3192 2018-09-03 17:25:29 Fine if you do it properly. Sausages and bacon at room temp. Stretch the bacon first. Use unsmoked rindless streaky. Pre heat oven - make it HOT. don’t add any oil . Turn halfway through cooking .
3193 2018-09-03 17:25:23 Someone just posted that they have their dog on a cbd oil regimen...I need a lobotomy to be alive in this world
3194 2018-09-03 17:25:21 Haha, alright. Once you've made the saalan, while it's still in the pan tear off a square of aluminium foil and make an indentation in the middle like a boat and set it atop the saalan. Heat a piece of coal till red hot, set it in the middle and pour a few drops of oil over it.
3195 2018-09-03 17:25:21 can someone take my car to get an oil change? i’ll pay you. lmao I hate doing shit for my car lol they always trick me into doing other stuff
3196 2018-09-03 17:25:17 why don't you go and check just how much Oil/Coal get in subsidies from various governments.
 ($5.3 trillion in 2015)
3197 2018-09-03 17:25:07 Good Morning, Paster. I went to church this morning. Heard church members testimonies. Such agreat morning. Bishop touch everyones hand with oil. Told all of us JESUS name to ask and want bigger and better this for ourselves. BELIEVE!!!!
3198 2018-09-03 17:25:01 And precisely how do you get oil from a Turm?
3199 2018-09-03 17:24:51 This tweet needs the caveat: Notely’s bedfellows: Imperial Oil owned by Exon, former CE0 Rex Tillerson., Trump’s buddy.
3200 2018-09-03 17:24:44 Spain’s olive oil co-op @GrupoDcoop, the world’s largest, has reportedly acquired a 20% stake in Bell-Carter, the biggest producer of table olives in the U.S. In fact, Bell-Carter sells more than half of the olives from California.
3201 2018-09-03 17:24:37 The important part is that they’re pretty dry. So like make sure to dry/rinse well and only put like maybe a tablespoon or so of oil on them. Just enough for a light coat. I used safflower oil, but at that low temp I bet olive oil would be fine too.
3202 2018-09-03 17:24:33 @KlasraRauf @Muqabil92 manika sb was wrong they drunk olive oil and honey instead
3203 2018-09-03 17:24:13 Since I was in the Army, it skews my perspective of him a bit. I saw GWB as a man who was getting payback for insults against his father. I understand why he did it. But, men & women I served with died for ego & oil. We need a better system of checks & balances for presidents.
3204 2018-09-03 17:24:12 And still we r paying the highest price for oil in India
3205 2018-09-03 17:24:06 This country needs more olive oil
3206 2018-09-03 17:24:03 I also pray to the almighty LORD as you may be enough capable to handle unbridled inflation due to oil price hike. Not a single word is passing from your tounge.... We are seeing.. Wait for 2019..we are becoming just impatient.
3207 2018-09-03 17:24:00 Trudeau has called out Saudi Arabia for human rights violations, but is continuing to sell them military hardware and taking their oil.
Hypocrisy at it's finest, where's MSM on this?
3208 2018-09-03 17:23:53 No wonder a 5 year old allegation is now being dealt with against Alex Salmond-the unionists are running scared. No wonder.. all that lovely oil trickling away! Must think we’re Fucking daft..
3209 2018-09-03 17:23:51 So much oil :)

3211 2018-09-03 17:23:35 Why does CBD oil taste so rank
3212 2018-09-03 17:23:33 Eco nuts do not care about Canadian jobs. I know quite a few people who have jobs with oil companies. They get paid very well and are tested very well. Once again you are caught lying. You need a “Get out of jail” card.
3213 2018-09-03 17:23:30 Nalbantoğlu oil.
3214 2018-09-03 17:23:26 Hope that $2,000 in credit card debt is at least a cash advance so they can buy cheap crude oil futures options so at least it can go up 1000%
3215 2018-09-03 17:23:25 I never did jouvert bc I didn’t want to get covered in oil and they were throwing battery acid for a few years lol but the parade was always just whine and drink 
3216 2018-09-03 17:22:53 Lol. I just noticed. Well, check your dm for the beard oil i use
3217 2018-09-03 17:22:48 To explain is a bit more: it is about an oil company like OGDCL or Shell etc which has shares on stock market...with oil discovery the share price normally goes up: so employee leaking this information and make investment (himself or thru friend) forehand is a corruption or not?

3225 2018-09-03 17:22:03 Big oil employs hundreds of thousands of Canadians in well paying jobs.  Because they build things. The #gpc mandate is to tear things down. Not many jobs in that.

3236 2018-09-03 17:21:02 Yeah blame Big Oil for your sabotage and obstructionism...#Hypocrite
3237 2018-09-03 17:21:02 Not only the price is increased for the essential commodities, but also gasoline prices, crude oil prices, diesel prices are also rising high day by day i.e. Rising energy prices. Oil and food prices are causing inflation.

3242 2018-09-03 17:20:28 Please spare us your darnomics. Previous govt had a golden opportunity if COEC investment and low oil prices. Yet they wasted it.

5. if prices drop what happens 2 demand?
3245 2018-09-03 17:20:16 I get annoyed at oil changes for no good reason. My company literally picks up my car and leaves me a loaner, then brings it back to me. Somehow I find this terribly inconvenient.  #spoiled

3253 2018-09-03 17:19:17 We already have some socialism in the US (roads, snow plows, the military, etc.)

Soviet Union was communist
Venezuela ran on oil (not to mention external issues)

I suppose you've never heard of social-democracies, like Norway or Sweden?
3254 2018-09-03 17:19:14 If you consider 200,000 bbl/day going to the west coast by rail 'hardly any', well never let the facts stand in the way of a good delusion. The existing Trans Mountain pipeline has been operating since 1955. Modern technology expansion would be much safer. Oil demand increasing.

3266 2018-09-03 17:18:10 Thanks. the main point is this: during downturn, only operating costs matter, which is relatively small.  People do not realize this: how many OIL companies went bankrupt between 2015 and 2017? This will answer the whole book.

3273 2018-09-03 17:17:31 My friends in Petr. Eng. school at U.of Wyoming in the 1970's thought it would be stupid if we used Tar Sands, thought we would come up with a better source of fuel in 40 years.  They didn't know of GREED of Oil Barons and Banksters!
3274 2018-09-03 17:17:27 Thanks Ben.
3275 2018-09-03 17:17:22 And his dependance is what the oil companies have been actively working to maintain. Electric cars were here 20 years ago and would now be mainstream if they weren't blocked. Look up the ev1. The ev1's demise is what sparked @elonmusk to build electric cars. See #Tesla's history.

3284 2018-09-03 17:17:04 Gotta smoke better oil then.
3285 2018-09-03 17:17:02 But we mainly went there to plant military bases and so maintain a hold on cheap energy in the form of oil for the next 50 years. Energy prices will rise and so their grip remains tight. Trump won't let go either. Neither will the next president.
3286 2018-09-03 17:17:01 @tednaiman to confirm I understand you consider a higher ratio of protein to fat and low carb. If correct how much fat do you consider too much and what how much coconut oil is the correct amount. Thanks
3287 2018-09-03 17:17:00 Yessssss! Sounds good lol I just made chicken and pasta last night. Didn't have any sauce so I ad libbed with some garlic and oil
3288 2018-09-03 17:16:53 Rupee at record low means higher multiplier value.. so if oil is 78 $ per bbl and 1 USD touches 71 INR instead of 69 ( Rupee weakens), the oil price relatively in terms of INR/ bbl will see almost 3% jump.
3289 2018-09-03 17:16:50 I am way excited about my new venture! Cindy Rademacher is an amazing teacher whose going to teach me aboit Young Living essential oil and products. I have already seen these products at work! Amazing. Can't wait to learn more and help others out too.
3290 2018-09-03 17:16:41 I live in anthracite country, and nearly everyone knew people won't go back to shoveling coal, cleaning coal dust, lung damage, & taking the ashes out every day.  It's like imagining whale oil lamps are coming back to replace electric lights.

3295 2018-09-03 17:16:13 Sounds more like a bio fuel product-Oil comes from organic material, mostly algae,which was quickly buried in mud at the bottom of oceans and lakes – So, it never had a chance to fossilize. Pressure, heat and time converted the organic material into kerogen, oil and natural gas
3296 2018-09-03 17:16:07 To console those who mourn in Zion, To give them beauty for ashes, The oil of joy for mourning, The garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; That they may be called trees of righteousness, The planting of the Lord, that He may be glorified.
Isaiah 61:3
3297 2018-09-03 17:16:03 Tire pressure and checking oil. I can also open my own hood but izzy’s car hood is dumb
3298 2018-09-03 17:15:53 So it's not that the price of oil will go down to zero, that it will really be worthless...  the price will always bounce around the (marginal) cost of extraction.  Like we saw with coal, a small dip in demand may depress prices a little.  When costs are largely fixed or cannot

3303 2018-09-03 17:15:30 That’s because cone carrier and base oils are not properly proportioned. Oil of ulay never suited me, gave me itching and where as suits my mum since for ever. Just get to know the carrier oils for your skin type and should work. Use good old almond oil or castor oil otherwise.

3305 2018-09-03 17:15:15 In 1921, The Mexican government and US oil businessmen sign and agreement to raise by ten percent the cost of oil sold to the latter. The amount is destined to pay the external debt of Mexico.

3319 2018-09-03 17:13:25 Why would you use alcohol bottles for honey and olive oil?
3320 2018-09-03 17:13:12 She had honey and olive oil.
3321 2018-09-03 17:13:10 I would if we were being invaded but we just go around invading other countries to gain access to their oil and resources...?

3323 2018-09-03 17:12:41 I think coz rupee is weakening against dollar and we import oil.
3324 2018-09-03 17:12:39 I bulk steam broccoli and keep it in the freezer. At snack time I roast it with some sesame oil or whatever and spices/tamari for like 20 mins at 400F then take it out, crumble some tempeh over it and add agave and tamari on top and roast for like 15 more minutes. Eat over rice

3327 2018-09-03 17:12:28 There should be an FAA regulation requiring that all airlines provide passengers on flights of 4 hours or more the option to watch Bob Ross’s The Joy Of Oil Painting on their in-flight entertainment systems.

3329 2018-09-03 17:12:24 Yes and no, they are not exactly crazy about stress tests, Dodd frank compliance costs, and being more hated than oil companies.  But yes, the barier to big banking is even higher. 

Big banks may see real losses from EMs. Someone has to pay.
3330 2018-09-03 17:12:24 So the Pastors sentenced to 45 yrs for preaching in Saudi Arabia weren’t afforded cultural sensitivities?  We have oil. No excuse the Saudis are not our friends they are enemies. Remember 911???  Treat the country as such

3332 2018-09-03 17:12:19 We used a lot of cremes with my daughter. We tried clinic aquese creme it was worse. We tried Epimex it was worse, we tried coconut oil it helped then skin went back to normal we then tried E45 which we used for months and it helped. Then went to vaseline
3333 2018-09-03 17:12:14 Perhaps we should re-examine our way of life. Life will exist on this planet after we are gone. Life isn't dependent on oil. Capitalism but not life. If people believe your proclamation then there will be no progress toward the sort of change we need to see to secure our future.

3336 2018-09-03 17:11:52 What budget? The one released by the regime? Read Filkin’s piece ‘Shadow Commander’ where he reveals Soleimani’s 250k barrel share of Iraqi oil under US’s nose. Also see 1 billion in cash delivered to IRI. For region’s sake, regime should be deprived of USD it needs for expansion

3340 2018-09-03 17:11:41 The past and present can be very misleading in predicting future trends.

Thankfully for the climate and for consumers, people will choose EVs (of whatever is best in the future) instead of ICE. Oil will follow a similar path as coal did in recent years.

3342 2018-09-03 17:11:31 I figured at least it was still useable, and i could thin it with some oil or agave nectar to make it spreadable. But when I started to stir in the nectar, I noticed it was seizing up more, like when you stir water into tahini.

3345 2018-09-03 17:11:21 Just because they are tanker cars doesn’t mean they are carrying crude oil. Tankers used for other products as well - liquid chemicals, canola oil, etc.
3346 2018-09-03 17:11:14 His opinions and my shit is worth the same..Though I should say that we Indians are being exploited by oil prices by this incompetent govt.
3347 2018-09-03 17:11:14 okay ... you tell what one would call someone who willingly and without thought swallows truck loads of lies, snake oil and deceit .. then rushes back for more without so much as a proper perusal of the label????
3348 2018-09-03 17:11:13 Unfortunately the power brokers behind the scenes call all the shots. wall st. big oil, banks, corporate America, basically anybody with enough $$$ and clout. Politicians are mere puppets to do their bidding and to further their  agenda.
3349 2018-09-03 17:11:09 Lmaooooooo. Buy beards oil my guy. It's that simple
3350 2018-09-03 17:11:09 U.S.A is worlds biggest terrorist country who is looting oil and money of Islamic countries by its false drams and puppets like Usama then ISIS .it firstly creates so called terrorists then send them to the country where from U.S.A wants oil and money then blames Islam.

 oh how I loved this weekend with @howetolove and @takeasmartpill. Thank you for hosting me and @schneidz, we love you guys! 
3353 2018-09-03 17:11:00 If that’s what you think then the Middle East does the same thing with oil. They increased giving money to politicians because of the increase of attacks on the second amendment.

3364 2018-09-03 17:09:57 Put oil on them! That might help!
3365 2018-09-03 17:09:57 this is what happens when governments force people to live together  when they are not compatible to do so, like oil and water they never mix no matter hoe many time you stir them.
3366 2018-09-03 17:09:37 Don't trust them if they tell you you need anything else. Pay for your oil change and nothing else.
3367 2018-09-03 17:09:36 I remember..very responsible me.
3368 2018-09-03 17:09:29 can we subsidise petroleum products & bleed the  economy & oil companies. Thanks to thee .You are not the PM,who blames everyone & ask for  pardon in front of a court,when defamation case is filed.Give concrete alternate ideas which will reduce these prices.
3369 2018-09-03 17:09:22 Then we need, to go after, wall street, big oil and, war profiteers. Freeze his accounts.

3371 2018-09-03 17:09:18 For now add a drop of olive oil in aloe and use. Should be a win win
3372 2018-09-03 17:09:04 @Clicks_SA today I went on ur website to check if that was true and only 2 discover that the oil ones were also on special

3375 2018-09-03 17:08:20 I do oil of oregano drops on flights and while traveling - a few drops under the tongue and held there for a few secs, then rinsed down with a lot of water/juice/whatever. It’s super spicy and strong-tasting (I feel like I ate old-school pizza sauce) but seems to fend off colds.
3376 2018-09-03 17:08:16 Relaxation day... over did it... ASMR oil blending video!
3377 2018-09-03 17:08:13 Now you are on the side of the working class? You protest to take away 1000s of jobs  our oil industry and the run offs from it. Your only existence in parliament is against the working class. You can't drink from both sides of the cup.
3378 2018-09-03 17:08:12 Firstly, fracking isn’t an industry, it’s an unconventional oil recovery technique. Secondly, the economic viability of shale oil and gas development varies widely from area to area. Development decisions are made based on much more technical data than the author understands. 1/2
3379 2018-09-03 17:07:43 Nobody takes one listen and asks, "So, Picardy, Bourbonnais, Oreleans? Langues d'oil, I imagine" ?
3380 2018-09-03 17:07:34 Bush was probably the dumbest pres ever. But he was mever really president. 

George H. W. Bush and his oil buddies needed to finish what they started in the Middle East in 91. 

They stole Florida cause they knew thet boy wasn't gonna win. W was just along for the ride.

3384 2018-09-03 17:07:25 rose water, vitamin e oil, olive oil & peppermint oil in a spray bottle
3385 2018-09-03 17:07:24 @Clicks_SA at the till I was charged the normal price & enquired about it & was told only the normal ones were on special (not the oil)
3386 2018-09-03 17:07:07 Takes CBD oil to prevent anxiety and help with headaches "naturally".

Has the worst anxiety attack I've ever had that lasts for an entire week and makes me miss work.

Calls shop and they refuse to refund me telling me what happened is "impossible". 

Stay away from this stuff.
3387 2018-09-03 17:07:07 No. I'm thinking more along the lines of avocado oil.
3388 2018-09-03 17:07:03 Agree it doesn't help the public much but Malhotra has done a lot to confuse the public and most dietitians advise against using coconut oil.  Raquel Britzke quoted as a dietitian in the Mail article is actually not on the UK HCPC list ?

3390 2018-09-03 17:06:56 Big oil is destroying the wetlands and bayous and marshland of Louisiana. It is horrible and sad. Too bad restoration projects have to be done in the first place. We need clean energy and off of the fossil fuels.
3391 2018-09-03 17:06:44 Ten years ago Oil was ~$140/Barrel and Petrol ~R14/L and R/Dollar ~9? 
I'm under correction. Fact remains Taxes and promises for votes is a dead end. @CyrilRamaphosa
3392 2018-09-03 17:06:40 Aloe is used to make the skin dry and supple and olive oil is used to hydrate. Mix vitamin e capsule with aloe for a midway situation.

3397 2018-09-03 17:05:49 I don't have 73 minutes to watch it. So let me just ask you why a west Texas oil man (which is what George H.W. Bush was in 1963) would want to kill the President.
3398 2018-09-03 17:05:43 Not even a close comparison. Do you know how many millions of products rely on oil?  Your precious “green energy solutions” wouldn’t exist without it! Enjoy your wonderful life brought to you by fossil fuels however if you want “clean energy”, go all in on Nuclear, big time!
3399 2018-09-03 17:05:42 Still a president and a businessman who is backed by Wall Street banks, big oil and war profiteers?
3400 2018-09-03 17:05:24 First reported 3 bottles found in #SharjeelMemon room. Now 2 bottles report in circulation. Where is 3rd one?

3406 2018-09-03 17:05:01 If the weather is hot, dry or humid and the skin type is combination or oily then aloe. It it’s cold, or the skin type is on dry side then olive oil:m. Any kind of oil that’s left onto the skin on oily/combination skin or in hot/humid weather leaves breakouts and leads to acne.

3414 2018-09-03 17:03:53 I had a professional do the first round and then basically had to use a ton of coconut oil and special shampoo/conditioner to keep it looking good (and non-crispy)

3419 2018-09-03 17:02:57 Further high oil prices will not be good for economy as inflation will increase, then rbi will be forced to increase repo rate , then banks will increase interest rates..So growth will stumble..A vicious cycle will start..

3421 2018-09-03 17:02:40 Avoid multiple hair treatments. Eat well. Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Is it NISIM or NHB? A shampoo to controls hair loss. or very close to. How can I uncover the appropriate URL. Can't find it. Organic ingredients.
3422 2018-09-03 17:02:29 Se a noi va la parte con oil&gas perché no. 
3423 2018-09-03 17:02:28 Perhaps you should have stated your true employment when making your statement. You now have more credibility as far as I'm concerned but looking at AIS and the multitude of tankers off Asia it seems there is virtually no slow down in oil movement to Asia and from it
3424 2018-09-03 17:02:25 Cuomo has allowed fracked gas to flow through newly constructed pipelines under the Hudson River through poorer towns. Venting of gases is destroying air quality. One pipeline runs 100 ft from Indian Pt. nuclear power plant. Oil and gas owns Cuomo.

3440 2018-09-03 17:00:51 Why don't the to government use the oil we mine to pay our debts? Then free us from this suffering
3441 2018-09-03 17:00:50 Sir also should change the notion of depreciating currency is good and reer adjustment. We are current ac deficit country where biggest import is oil, depreciating currency hurts us and inflation the most. Thgh nri & western world loves it. Bad for country
3442 2018-09-03 17:00:48 Incidentally, this is one reason why I couldn't accept the LEAP manifesto. The Greens had the bright future while the Joes in the oil patch were ditched into the abyss. We're ALL in this together.

3445 2018-09-03 17:00:23 Venezuela didnt collapse because the government redistributed wealth poorly, it collapsed because the price of oil collapsed Venezuela was dependent on oil revenue for wealth before Chavez and his socialist policies so a drop in oil prices would have hurt the country just as much

3449 2018-09-03 17:00:01 I still don't understand the idea that pipelines are bad. You do realize that oil and gas when not moved by pipeline, is moved by truck and train, meaning the likelihood of spillage goes way up, right?
3450 2018-09-03 16:59:54 Republicans are filling that beautiful swamp with Russian oil money.
3451 2018-09-03 16:59:49 And to think how much oil would be saved if drivers were close to a healthy weight. Literally millions of barrels a year. #overweight and #mileage don’t mix. Think about it.
3452 2018-09-03 16:59:39 I got this hair oil and it’s doing wonders 
3453 2018-09-03 16:59:29 Didn't the FIA perform some unusual pre race checks on oil and fuel on the Ferrari? Sure I heard something in the build up on @SkySportsF1. Related?  #SkyF1 #ItalianGP
3454 2018-09-03 16:59:27 With the pipeline assessment paying for over half the municipal taxes and this being oil country it would be quite a race to see who would be first to kicked any anti pipeline protesters down the road first!

3459 2018-09-03 16:59:04 wow oil prices are going to come down to Rs, 6- a litre after the GST meet
3460 2018-09-03 16:58:50 So far so good! I had an initial break out, which was expected. But I went from oily skin and scalp, to not not a drop of oil on either. The drying out does suck, but with the right lotions it hasn’t been unbearable!
3461 2018-09-03 16:58:31 When can I use the oil again

3467 2018-09-03 16:57:32 That's right. So I guess the oil future is clear now!
3468 2018-09-03 16:57:32 I've tried everything and honestly the only thing that's worked is;

 - go to a clearing in a deep forest
 - rub both hands in olive oil
 - bow to the rising sun
 - say a prayer to the Platinum Dragon
 - wonder what you are doing with your life 
 - wait until they're like 6yo

3474 2018-09-03 16:56:50 There are many oil trolls out there who just want to polarize & stop/prevent intelligent debate, but let's not throw this word around without definitive proof of bad faith. So-called "experts" were happy to give up on some pipes & sell TM when conditions evolved.
3475 2018-09-03 16:56:48 Can you answer this simple question 
If you  know that there will be an oil discovery in very near future by your company and knowing this you ( or you  ask any of your   relative to) invest to get the profit .. and if this happens .. is  this a form of corruption or not ?

Otherwise do roast some butternut squash with drizzle of oil, lashings of butter, bit of pepper and some rosemary. DELICIOUS.

3491 2018-09-03 16:55:25 No @ProfJNMoyo, the correct stance to take would be to concede the point. The ConCourt ruling is not yet out in full, but so far your position seems to be wrong.

3505 2018-09-03 16:53:28 The problem is that "they" do care and tried to save those jobs. In doing so, they lost sacrificed hundreds of thousands of future jobs in clean energy. Oil is dying, like it or not and that will mean many times the number of lost jobs that could have been replaced by renewables.

Who knew all it took was checking my oil.

3580 2018-09-03 16:45:19 Except when your rollback of safety regulations risks the lives of mine workers, meat processing line workers and those working on oil rigs.

3584 2018-09-03 16:44:56 Coconut oil resists oxidation even on boiling at 76 degrees centigrade. So there are no transfats in #CoconutOil. While fried foods are not good for health, if fried in coconut oil, fried foods are not that bad too @arvindvarchaswi
3585 2018-09-03 16:44:55 Coconut oil contains so many anti-oxidants that it resists oxidation even if preserved for longer periods, whereas all other fats would have been oxidised to transfatty acids by the time they come on the food store shelves #CoconutOil @arvindvarchaswi
3586 2018-09-03 16:44:53 Coconut oil has been classified as a functional food which means food that provides health benefits over the basic nutrients. No other fat except the Indian ghee from A2 milk enjoys this status as #CoconutOil @arvindvarchaswi
3587 2018-09-03 16:44:51 Coconut oil has excellent therepeutic values ranging from controlling body weight to sugar levels. It aids in easy digestion, checks cholesterol and sugar levels. In short #CoconutOil is a treasure house to all health benefits @arvindvarchaswi
3588 2018-09-03 16:44:50 Coconut oil has the unique quality of being digested by salivary lipase, which absorbs food immediately and gives energy like carbohydrates. All other fats require pancreatic lipase for digestion which is absent in infants # CoconutOil @arvindvarchaswi
3589 2018-09-03 16:44:49 Coconut oil supports the thyroid function which is linked to brain function and our well being. Medium chain fatty acids present in #CoconutOil boosts metabolism and provide immediate energy @arvindvarchaswi
3590 2018-09-03 16:44:47 Coconut oil has high content of Medium Chain Fatty Acids which are easily oxidized and stored in adipose tissue, thus #CoconutOil diminishes the basal metabolic rate which aids in treatment of Obesity @arvindvarchaswi

3594 2018-09-03 16:44:38 @bdnews24 @TheStarKenya @NTVnewsroom Why cant Turkana oil subsidize the Kenyan oil prices and save motorists of the 16% VAT increase on fuel? This is what makes me believe Uhuru's degree from LSE is equally fake, like any other fake news! @MarkMasai
3595 2018-09-03 16:44:36 A stray thought:
Art can express vulgarity. In fact, it might be a defining fact that music lets us both paint pixel art and oil paintings, AND lets us give up halfway through, simply to add a pixel drawing of a slimy dick on the tank we failed to paint...

3599 2018-09-03 16:43:52 The only thing missing from Canada now is a believable “climate action plan” in light of Notley and Trudeau’s support for filthy tar sands oil and their pledge to bring more of it to the world.

3602 2018-09-03 16:43:23 They have to buy oil on the open market in US Dollars. Now that’s power that should yield productive talks.
3603 2018-09-03 16:43:21 Many people from the Maritimes benefited from Alberta oil as well. No government or unions to help these workers.
3604 2018-09-03 16:43:10 Time to do some homework. "markets have been valuing fracking companies not based on a multiple of profits," No kidding. Oil companies are valued based on reserves.
3605 2018-09-03 16:43:10 Wired, looking for deep water outlets for our oil when we can’t even sell our own product to our selves .
3606 2018-09-03 16:43:03 Well, I’m not idle doing nothing thinking that my country is oil rich. You can’t even quote what PMB said without twisting it. Comprehension is one of your problems, try working on that.
3607 2018-09-03 16:42:47 adding cooking oil to pap makes it taste nice though 
3608 2018-09-03 16:42:41 Oil pump > refinery. That's the pipe.  I think folks just want chemical plants and whatnot.

3612 2018-09-03 16:42:02 Crud oil is imported from foreign countries and India has to pay in hard currency like US $ .The problem with we Indians is we always want to use our own vehicles and desist from using public transport because it hurts our false ego  and the false pride.
3613 2018-09-03 16:42:00 Manmohan singh only subsidised the fuel to keep the prices low & kept issuing oil bonds which almost brought the oil companies to closure.This cn nvr b termed as gud mgmt  bt economic mismgmt
3614 2018-09-03 16:41:50 What's ur suggestion? Oil is imported,Cost of import is being recovered+tax on it to build this nation ,why should government stop building the nation or stop the import of Oil ?
3615 2018-09-03 16:41:43 The slob Bannon will just use interview by editor as platform for Bannon right wing blathering ideas.  Just another con man/grifter selling his snake oil

3619 2018-09-03 16:41:19 actually looks really interesting..a change from  my oil shares.
3620 2018-09-03 16:41:18 I’m not a science denier. But I’m not naive either. Petroleum is here to stay for a while & can work in harmony with going green. Research & educate yourself on all the facts. Ironically, a well executed gas & oil industry will provide the revenue needed to get to green faster!
3621 2018-09-03 16:41:14 Sir 10+VAT 25% Atleast 12.5 rupees. When crude oil fell Government went on fleecing Now they can reduce. Probably Govt. feels crude prices around $70 only and people buying at higher rates of Crude @$100/110.Another expectation govt may reduced tax on the eve of Dec elections.
3622 2018-09-03 16:40:58 Bhai, khandani hai tu risk ziada hai..
You can just slow down by Proper oiling your hair once or twice a week.
You can use Sarson ka taal + castor oil+ coconut oil and mix all and apply on your scalp.

3624 2018-09-03 16:40:37 Did you know? #DYK 
Many CBD oil companies make false claims about their products. Lab results are extremely important. Some products could contain little or no CBD, or worse, be toxic and have harsh chemicals.

3634 2018-09-03 16:38:55 Gotta admire the way LCN's business model encompasses multiple industries. They have completely dominated world Olive oil production and distribution along with the falsifying of quality and origin
3635 2018-09-03 16:38:52 I don't know what kind of logic is this....by that logic... businessmen should use Bullock cart for transportation....bro accept it that ths  govt failed on every aspect...& Therefore Should cut duties on the oil...diesel is 70+...m just worried abt the poor farmers.
3636 2018-09-03 16:38:52 I know you’ve probably tried it already but just in case, they apparently hate peppermint oil?
3637 2018-09-03 16:38:49 “Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.” Psalms 23:4-5

3639 2018-09-03 16:38:41 @RodPhillips01 @SteveClarkPC Is the same change/cost reduction being made to apply to home heating oil? Many rural residents don't have natural gas and still rely on fuel oil for their home heating.

3642 2018-09-03 16:38:32 We'd hope global oil production would decline. But don't think it will disappear. Aviation currently has no viable substitute so we'll at least need some.

Impacts on plastics therefore more related to price & knock-on impacts on economic (dis)advantage relative to substitutes.
3643 2018-09-03 16:38:29 I might have a little punt here.
3644 2018-09-03 16:38:15 are you aware that the SNP led the charge in demanding tax breaks for the North Sea after the oil price crash?

if you think indy would create currently unrealised oil tax wealth, I’m afraid you’re dreaming
3645 2018-09-03 16:38:09 Imagine the state, “lot of oil coming out of this cheesecake John.”
3646 2018-09-03 16:38:08 Alex: "You're my little hippie, and I love that everything you own smells like peppermint oil, and patchouli." 

I was so unaware of how strongly I smelled of my oils. 
3647 2018-09-03 16:38:03 Your cost of living isn't going to go back down if they take away the tax cuts.
You will be stuck with the higher prices and a smaller check. 
Oil prices are overinflated because that is where OPEC wants them, thus higher gas prices. Which in turn raises the price of everything.

This is killing our country's economy man.

Thats the kind of tax they are charging us..

3702 2018-09-03 16:32:44 OPEC & IGU are cartels that seek to enrich themselves at cost of developing nations. Persian oil dominates our oil needs but is affected by US sanctions.
If there's instability in Persian gulf & Strait of Hormuz is blocked, base fuel prices will rise by 20%. #Fact
3703 2018-09-03 16:32:29 It is the governments duty to ensure the markets remain free and when one single entity controls an entire industry and buys out any and all competitors, it’s time to step in when they’ve betrayed the public’s trust. Standard oil was broken up believe me Google can be too

3705 2018-09-03 16:32:18 Whale blubber is no longer boiled down to make oil, but just wait until our Shit-for-Brains President hears that it could be a potential fuel source for oil lamps on Fox & Friends and rollbacks their protection to ‘Make Harpooning the Whale Great Again’.
3706 2018-09-03 16:32:17 However, yes overall the country will benefit with lower oil prices, but e-vehicles are more polluting w-to-w as against petrol or diesel. 

Diesel is also more used in Industrial sector such as gensets where electrification is not there or sporadic / unreliable

3713 2018-09-03 16:31:35 And being anointed with Chrism Oil and a promise of obedience to the Ordinary comes with a responsibility to build up the Body of Christ. When haven't you chosen not to be in a fight?   Sleazy, Occult  and now Fight: again you put little thought into your choice of words.
3714 2018-09-03 16:31:32 My baby is washed and detailed, oil changed, and tank full. Wow having kids is soooo expensive lol 
3715 2018-09-03 16:31:24 I’m just a girl, waiting for a day, when her coconut oil will be solid again.
3716 2018-09-03 16:31:24 Ruby development. Bumbleby. Winter maiden being a Schnee...or just someone who isn't a bitch.
3717 2018-09-03 16:31:22 what's "moral" about killing children for oil?

3719 2018-09-03 16:31:11 On the other hand, we can get windfall profit from natural resources as we export oil, gas and coal
3720 2018-09-03 16:31:01 Oil is used in everything you use. Everything
3721 2018-09-03 16:31:01 nothing breaks the moment of reading large, dusty tomes with your black cat laid out on your lap by oil lamp quite like someone bursting in the room to tell you to make toast
3722 2018-09-03 16:30:58 13 under 40 working evenly instead of Oil & Energy.
3723 2018-09-03 16:30:46 Ummmm, those oil and gas jobs are still very much needed, Suncor market cap is $70 Billion, that is 1 company dwarfing the Cannabis sector. I am in Cannabis, but not bailing on my peeps in O&G sector, we can all function together.
3724 2018-09-03 16:30:43 2-2 By 1979, most oil countries have already nationalized and fully owned their own oil resources with full control of production and export decisions.  That was not the during the Shah time.  
The idea of drying up the sources of funding makes sense, but needs military blockade!
3725 2018-09-03 16:30:42 Cong.& BJP to answer the Role of Pvt.Cos In oil pricing under administered(UPA)/mkt.oriented(NDA).Under any pricing Pvts make profit,Have Been So.But for PSUs, petrol would have reached₹100/lit.Long Back.
3726 2018-09-03 16:30:33 Unions played a part in helping oil field workers get occasional raise and benefits. It served a purpose. I am Conservative but saw my dad strike in Tx, yet the non union workers accepted the benefits he got for them.
3727 2018-09-03 16:30:30 I want to do more painting, but not allowed by the landlord. He was so pissed when he saw my oil painting setup!

3730 2018-09-03 16:30:24 A drop in a bucket? That money can be used in so many different ways! Not just for oil employees! 600 days is better than no days! It’s time to look forward, not backwards. Maybe if #LPC did things correctly, I would support them on this, but they haven’t & they won’t! #cdnpoli

3736 2018-09-03 16:29:55 That’s completely asinine. Why do Canadians have to fall on the sword while the rest of the exporting countries flourish? 

Let’s not forget that many oil exporting countries have non-existent human rights and most have pitiful environmental standards.

3748 2018-09-03 16:28:14 1-2 Time now is different from the time of the Shah of 1978: they have money to spend. The Shah did not.  Now, the Iranians are getting the full price of their exported oil. 
During the Shah, unlike other countries, Iran was getting ONLY a small portion of the price.

3754 2018-09-03 16:27:38 Sir, I read that a lot of it was also necessary for paying up the past oil bonds which subsidized us with lower prices earlier. I may be wrong
3755 2018-09-03 16:27:38 #86TooMuch
@narendramodi 
Sir:

Cut flab in PSU's make them efficient &profitable.
Oil Marketing Companies, ONGC & GAIL & Oil India 2 become > efficient & > profitable so fuel prices are lowered. Modiji some action,
Sack  Chairman's if performance in 03 months is not improved
3756 2018-09-03 16:27:37 How much petrol common man requires. Say 20 liters per month. Then from 71 to 81  = 10 Rs increase  means Rs 200 he is paying more. The price of Urad Dal was 180 and Toor Dal 120 now it is100 and 64 So what more he is spending ?We import oil that has to be remembered.  #86TooMuch
3757 2018-09-03 16:27:33 So interesting how fast we have depleted our conventional crude oil supply and are almost at wits end trying to find creative ways (ala fracking shale oil, tar sands, etc) to scrape the bottom of the barrel.
3758 2018-09-03 16:27:29 Both industries need to do better in terms of their environmental footprint but surely palm oil is ahead??
3759 2018-09-03 16:27:22 The biggest problem 35 years ago with the NEP was the oil market collapsed and Alberta suffered... just like today the blame for the collapse of the world oil price is put on Notley and was put on Trudeau Sr then...
3760 2018-09-03 16:27:22 FYI.....Cindy McCain supports 100% Medical Marijuana and CBD oil, Sheila. Do the right thing and get on board. #BeLikeCindy
3761 2018-09-03 16:27:20 My mom thought my CBD Oil was my Vitamin D3 I been taking the whole time 
3762 2018-09-03 16:27:14 Things middle-class elderly see:

Home heating oil then: $1.969 - $2.59 now

3764 2018-09-03 16:26:52 كلام الوزارة صحيح الان ، بس الاشكالية وزارة التجارة ممثلة بالمواصفات والمقاييس تقول انها ما جهه رقابية و حماية المستهلك مالها دخل بالمشكلة ، اذا من المسوول ؟؟ بس احب اذكر وزارة النفط ان كثير من تصريحاتها السابقه تناقض هذا الكلام
3765 2018-09-03 16:26:47 Joined an autism support group. Admin clarified today that you are not allowed to discuss CBD oil. It falls under medical advice. Your only allowed to discuss big pharma medications. #Confused
3766 2018-09-03 16:26:39 Idk why I didn’t start vaping cannabis oil earlier , it’s so amazing 
3767 2018-09-03 16:26:36 Are we so dumb or Naive? @sharjeelinam tests were asked to be done by Sindh Govt Hospitals, similarly, Sindh Govt checked if the bottles contained alcohol or oil, turns out it’s oil and sharjeel while being sick has only been drinking Abe ZamZam  #CJP sahab wake up #Pakistan
3768 2018-09-03 16:26:29 Ur head get better oil aswearugud
3769 2018-09-03 16:26:29 Palm oil is made from palms
And coconut oil is from coconuts

And olive oil is from olives
And baby oil is from babies?

3776 2018-09-03 16:25:57 Hmm, How could you use olive oil and honey in hospital
3777 2018-09-03 16:25:51 And African leaders are already salivating to oil properly their corrupt systems to enrich themselves at the expense of the poor masses.
3778 2018-09-03 16:25:44 Me and my dogs take our oil every mornin..we have had such wonderful results..I have become such a believer,i became a distributor..and I'm a sceptic from hell..#hempworx...
3779 2018-09-03 16:25:38    Satisfying: in low-calorie diets, the presence of olive oil is interesting because it relieves the feeling of hunger. In addition, its consumption has been associated with the production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that regulates moods. #AOVE #aceitedeoliva #EVOO #o

3781 2018-09-03 16:25:27 sir if reports in karachi can say, sharjeel memon is innocent, and chemical experts can say bottles were filled up with oil and honey while cheif justice was witness, i am sure pakistani doctors can also prove dar has lost memory since 1990 lol..
3782 2018-09-03 16:25:22 @PChidambaram_IN says Cong wants petrol, diesel to be brought under GST immediately. Will Modi Govt and @dpradhanbjp bite the bullet now? Or is everyone posturing even as govts rake in oil tax revenues? Don't forget 2014 slogan : bahut hui mehngai se maar, Abki Baar Modi sarkar!
3783 2018-09-03 16:25:09 There's something poetic about the story revolving around fuel shortage and then oil prices also hiked around the same time
3784 2018-09-03 16:25:02 You don't give a shit about working men and women of this country! Your administration is rolling back worker safety protections affecting underground mine safety inspections, offshore oil rigs and line speeds in meat processing plants, and others! Go to hell!

3786 2018-09-03 16:24:44 Oh I’m a lightweight. All I need is vape oil and I’m good.
3787 2018-09-03 16:24:40 why the fuck do olive oil tastings exist
3788 2018-09-03 16:24:30 Get the oil on pal grin and bare it  haha
3789 2018-09-03 16:24:21 After a contest and after they messed with your eyebrows

Me: *slaps castor oil on my brows* "grow thicker groooow!"
3790 2018-09-03 16:24:09 Shout out to the training I got when I worked at Bartrams if the oil refinery went. You have 60 seconds to get to the highest point and start sealing all the cracks with duct tape. G/L
3791 2018-09-03 16:23:58 At inflation of 4.9% and exchange rate of 71.1 fuel prices play high! Loans were massive on oil imports, clearing them was a priority!
3792 2018-09-03 16:23:57 عندما يبتليك الله بزوجه نكديه وعجزت في نصحها وتقويمها إعطها ورقتها ولعله خير لكما .
3793 2018-09-03 16:23:54 It didn't contain liquor, rather olive oil and honey
3794 2018-09-03 16:23:43 Actually, the "spermicite" oil found in large quantities in this species head resembled the characteristics of human sperm. In the 18 Century, whale oil was the fuel for lightning and cooking.
3795 2018-09-03 16:23:33 Trudeau has accomplished nothing. If Re elected Canada will be destroyed, economically, morally and all vestiges of security will be gone. We can't afford his illegals, oil strategy, and give away. If Justin is re-elected we will be the next Venezuela
3796 2018-09-03 16:23:32 You tried getting the b12 injection? I had it twice and its made a massiveeeeee difference to my anxiety. And my anxiety was SO bad! I hardly feel like that now....CBD oil is good to just don't taste grate at all 
3797 2018-09-03 16:23:27 Correction: corporate executives are doing better than ever before. Celebrate Wealth Inequality day!

How are people dumb enough to buy snake oil from the spoiled, lazy fraud known as Deluded Donnie Drumpf?
3798 2018-09-03 16:23:20 Jab koi deshdrohi fans jaata hai..midnight oil burn karte hain tab.
3799 2018-09-03 16:23:19 SHARJEEL MEMON ,S REPOTS ARE FAKE.I NEVER HEARD OLIVE OIL AND HONEY MIXTURE.HOSPITALS DO NOT HAVE THE FACILITIES OF              ANALYTICAL TESTING.THE MIXTURE SHOULD BE SENT TO PUNJAB DRUG TESTING LAB.
3800 2018-09-03 16:23:14 Agree. My sister lives in Williston, ND the oil part of the state, that Walmart is definitely a 3rd world country, empty shelves, women fear for their safety etc, horrible place.
3801 2018-09-03 16:23:14 extend invitations to all Filipino nurses. Next, business, again offer the EU a realistic version, if they refuse, all waters and oil will be levied at a high tax.
3802 2018-09-03 16:22:41 Add oil
3803 2018-09-03 16:22:40 so like geranium oil does wonders for anxiety
3804 2018-09-03 16:22:31 3/3 The oil prices may come down. Or it may cease to be an issue with the electorate come May 19. And who knows, the Govt may bring down excise duty by 50%, the equivalent of horse learning to fly.
3805 2018-09-03 16:22:23 جو بھی کیا؟ میں نے دیکھی ہے یہ رپورٹ 
How about some new brands in market like:
Famour grouse honey
Black label oil
Red label oil
Johny walker honey 
3806 2018-09-03 16:22:22 Yes, and where does the balance sheet show the increase in land subsidence and seismic activity?  I also doubt that alternative uses for the fresh water used (and costs for the communities affected) are shown by oil and gas accounting.
3807 2018-09-03 16:22:19 They use lane oil
3808 2018-09-03 16:22:07 riding a bike, putting on make up, throwing a football, using a saw, changing your oil, replacing a light switch, unclogging the kitchen drain, building a shed, planting a garden, growing plants from seeds, how to make bread dough, how to cook a big Thanksgiving dinner...
3809 2018-09-03 16:22:06 I'll try: pineapple, tomato, ketchup and mustard, steak,  fish, matchbox, wine glass, pepper, beer, french fries, watermelon, ice cream, cheese, fork and knives, hamburger, oil, mushroom, chopping board. I don't know the name for the device where you cook barbecue 
3810 2018-09-03 16:22:04 So far snake oil...
3811 2018-09-03 16:21:56 As long as when he makes mistakes (and he will make a lot of them) the oil fans don’t try to drive him out of town. Just like a large contingent of leafs fans are trying to drive out Gardiner.
3812 2018-09-03 16:21:54 The #Elders is not the thing that heals you. The oil is not the thing that heals you. Focus on Jesus & have Faith in God

If the Elders and oil are not available, you can pray the #prayer of faith just like the best of them, & lay hands on your self in Jesus name~

James 5:14-16~
3813 2018-09-03 16:21:54 Or like Manmohan, Modi should have bought crude on credit from Iran and issued oil bond to OMC to subsidise petrol and left the amount unpaid.
To be paid by Agali sarkar aur tax payer.

3815 2018-09-03 16:21:48 Castor oil on roots of hair
3816 2018-09-03 16:21:48 When I was in Aruba in 2015 I met an oil worker headed home to the US. He said Venezuela was a shithole, his words. I asked him if he could live anywhere in the world where would he choose, his answer? Israel.
3817 2018-09-03 16:21:29 Smooth as silk drenched in oil IMO
3818 2018-09-03 16:21:16 4.5 billion.  A drop in the bucket.  Given the current discounted oil, that's 7,000,000/day on just oil by rail.  That gives Alberta just over 600 days of a handout

3823 2018-09-03 16:20:24 he has no real power or authority, we need to stop spending oil revenue in the proxy war in Syria, stop sending found to Iraq, Houthis, and Hezbollah. is the leader makes the decisions and his generals.

3827 2018-09-03 16:20:01 @Zendaya happy birthday, lovely! Also, can u tell me what brand of vitamin e oil u use?
3828 2018-09-03 16:19:48 Man Mohan Singh appears to have managed the petrol price better by raising loan through oil bonds worth 1.5 lakh crores which is to be repaid. Moreover, the price of petrol was hovering around Rs 70/- during his time also. Now due to the reduced value of rupee the price is up.
3829 2018-09-03 16:19:43 Modi govt had to pay over 2 lakh crore in oil bonds left behind by UPA! Fuel prices are high! Bear the brunt for a few days! Atleast we r not in loan for oil borrowed!
3830 2018-09-03 16:19:40 douse me in olive oil and let me loose on a slip n slide if you wanna know what pure Unbridled chaos looks like
3831 2018-09-03 16:19:38 2/3
When asked how he can promise such an outlandish thing, he replied. Don't worry, the king may not live long enough, or the horse may not live long enough. Who knows, the horse may even learn to fly. So it is with oil.
3832 2018-09-03 16:19:37 When oil was king LA workers were happy to support Right To Work laws. Now that labor is struggling to catch up with economic growth at the top, it might be time to repeal those laws and support unions again. Unions empower labor with balanced power in industry.

3838 2018-09-03 16:19:13 I vape when I go overseas, looks no different than tobacco oil, I just fill up cartridges with the syringe type oils and zoom. It's not the same as smoking to me tho, just doesn't take that edge off, can't sleep with Vapes.
3839 2018-09-03 16:19:12 local bee/pest removal companies will also sometimes remove for free. If you are able, provide them with some shelter... Even a closed cardboard box or plastic tote with a hole and a board to keep the rain off will do. Get off the ground. Put some lemongrass oil inside too.
3840 2018-09-03 16:19:05 If we put solar on every home, wind farms where it makes sence ( like all around Mar-a-Lago) put bigger subsidizes on electric cars, we could get off foreign oil.

3849 2018-09-03 16:18:40 Killings, rapes and child abusing in Madrasas should be controlled on prior bases instead of controlling use of liquors.
Anyhow #SharjeelMemon didn't use any type of such liquor but honey and olive oil :-)
@sharjeelinam
3850 2018-09-03 16:18:37 After Sharjeel Memon’s blood report comes clear. 
Informant to CJP: Boss, I thought olive oil was a kind of wine.
CJP: Idiot! Naak katwa di.
Informant: Sir, maybe he has wine in his olive oil bottle.
CJP: Hmm. Good point. That calls for another raid.

3857 2018-09-03 16:18:07 It isn't that simple. There are many, many existing jobs in the oil and gas industry and replacing them will take years. But the journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step, a step Albertans must be willing to take.

3860 2018-09-03 16:17:53 Snake oil salesman, carnival barker, swindler, criminal, and general slippery slimeball is what he's been his entire life. He's from NYC, and everyone here has always known his name to be synonymous with cheap, tacky trash products and shady mob-connected businesses.
3861 2018-09-03 16:17:47 Not to mention synthetic oil needed to lubricate windmill gearboxes. However, life on this planet will survive without oil ... just won't be as much human life.

3865 2018-09-03 16:17:41 The idea of an "us" that includes people with whom we have differences of opinion seems alien to Herbie.

3870 2018-09-03 16:17:12 Here it's in densely populated areas where people have access to oil, gas or heat pumps. But they install dirty, stinking w.-f. central heatings because they get a lot of money from our govt when doing so ("eco-friendly"). This year was a new record of requests for funding .
3871 2018-09-03 16:17:09 ??? Via Rail has nothing to do with the transportation of oil. If you travel with them and ever expect them to be on time you are delusional. Via Rail runs on their own schedule and don't give a about anyone's schedule. CP and CN own the rights to the rails, not Via

3883 2018-09-03 16:15:56 Without current money, there is no investment in the future.  Keep land locking Alberta oil, and tax dollars stop flowing east to fund almost free Quebec daycare.

3975 2018-09-03 16:07:14 Greg - just stop. You’re wrong. Oil changes are closer to $100 than $400, and the intervals are 1 year on newer models. Find a new narrative.

2. The professional flesh presser. Slick starts with oil...greasy

3984 2018-09-03 16:06:03 Try putting a little bit of coconut oil on your ends and kinda massage your scalp. After the shower or before you put heat, or even after you style, try using low heat also. Braid your hair a little more, that helps a lot too! I have a shampoo that keeps your blonde touched up

3989 2018-09-03 16:05:46 OK, but they are replacing gas or oil. CNG buses also may not be better on carbon emissions. The leak rate must be very low for CNG vehicles to emit less carbon than diesel vehicles.

4014 2018-09-03 16:03:49 Interesting. 5 Million barrels is around $1 Billion. This appears to be  poor code word spy craft. Say she’s asking an intermediary for $10 Million, best to say how much for 10 Tokarov clips packed in gun oil.  Tokarov = specific money laundering, clips = millions, gun oil = NRA.

-booming economy 
-NATO scolded for working w/ Russia

Russia just isn't very good at this!

4034 2018-09-03 16:02:13 I don’t agree with Faye. Now, how come the very same logic was reversed and not applicable in 2012/13 ? Modi and BJP went to town about rising fuel prices & falling ₹. In 2014/15 oil was below $ 45 & fuel prices were? What’s goose for the gander...

4103 2018-09-03 15:56:33 if you think voting for indendence will  transform the profitability of North Sea oil or give us access to a time machine, I’m all ears

Now that is being used in electrification of villages, highways being built and to pay off the oil debt to Iran that was left by Maun Mohan Singh..
4105 2018-09-03 15:56:12 There are already more jobs in wind energy than in coal and that number will only grow more lopsided. We can't afford to let oil and coal go the way of steel and manufacturing and there's no need for them to.

there are a few oil wells in that area,just nosy.
4110 2018-09-03 15:55:58 Nail on exactly at right place - lower oil cost coupled with more than doubled revenue from tax penalising people - are the sole and only factor for good fiscal /inflation etc. There no iota of anything to do with govt
4111 2018-09-03 15:55:48 "Russia helped North Korea export supplies related to chemical weapons to Syria. Nor is this violation an isolated case. Moscow continues to illegally export oil to North Korea and to hire North Korean guest workers for construction projects in Siberia."
4112 2018-09-03 15:55:44 Yeah and replace the minimum 6% GDP drop with what, genius?  So import all of our oil from Saudi Arabia? Jesus, you're clueless
4113 2018-09-03 15:55:31 1. See what was done with the excise money. Jaitley said it would be used to fund roads.  Close to 25K KM of roads have been laid.
2. We have repaid oil bonds worth 2 lakh crore including 70K crore just in interest.

High cost is diff matter but rising excise was not a blunder
4114 2018-09-03 15:55:26 just on teslas produced/sold this year, big oil is NOT going to sell petrol/diesel for fuel and oil (for oil changes) worth $10B over the next 10 years. That's one billion every year. Not surprising they're hiring bad journos to write hit pieces on @tesla

4141 2018-09-03 15:53:28 Surely there are better solutions than to continue to dig up dirty, energy-intensive, high carbon tar.  Transition oil patch workers to wind, solar, biomass where possible.  Oil needs must be met with the lowest possible carbon cost, even if it means import.  #KeepItInTheGround

4143 2018-09-03 15:53:00 Why does coconut oil seem odd when I usually use olive oil in cakes?
4144 2018-09-03 15:52:49 The smoothest transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy (again it's a gradual transition not an instant replacement) would have to incorporate a way to train oil and coal workers to be able to work in the wind, solar, and hydroelectric fields.
4145 2018-09-03 15:52:44 So does that mean this go around with NAFTA, you will have the 8 billion dollar deficit instead of Canada? How be we keep all our resources and you can buy your oil from Russia, your natural gas from China, Your electricity from Mexico and who ever will sell you lumber and water.

4165 2018-09-03 15:50:57 Exactly. Improve it and bring back the public option he had to eliminate. Add incentives for the insurance industry to get involved. Maybe tap into the billions in subsidies going to the oil industry?
4166 2018-09-03 15:50:49 I believe what she’s saying is we have to get off of oil. Continuing to grow & expand it is “insane”. Do I need send you the google definition of “insanity”? Clearly from even an economic stand point, we must diversify our energy basket.

4186 2018-09-03 15:49:02 Can't help it. India only produces 20% of its oil requirement. Country is thus forced to buy 80% of oil at international price. We can't allow PSU to reel under the burdon of underrecoveries. We need to comsume oil judiciously @republic #86TooMuch @dpradhanbjp @narendramodi

Hwr,, both state and center hv some scope to reduce taxes in order reduce the burden on public. Reason also huge NPA created by earlier dispensation.

4244 2018-09-03 15:43:44 #86TooMuch | The price of crude oil is constantly dropping in international markets, but it keeps increasing in our country: Faizan Kidwai

4245 2018-09-03 15:43:43 Oil industry took a big hit under last potus. Great industry for me.
4246 2018-09-03 15:43:41 Y’all know what I love using on my skin... grape seed oil
4247 2018-09-03 15:43:35 In its announcement of fuel price adjustment, dept energy refers to "urgent temporary fuel price intervention measure" to absorb estimated 25 cents shortfall. Rather confusing or do they expect oil price to drop or rand to strengthen. Has Malema put pressure on govt?

4250 2018-09-03 15:43:15 Goodness of GDP is watered down through fuel price So! This was not even the prices when crude oil was $140! Cutdown all the taxes. When BJP rules 20 states, why not bring this item under GST. If not acted urgently Pappu waiting for 2019 trophy!  #86TooMuch
4251 2018-09-03 15:43:14 So go ahead and blame PRRD for the increase in international oil prices. You’ve run out of reasons anyway.
4252 2018-09-03 15:43:14 I gotta check with Bannon but I wonder if I can sell the strategic oil reserve to anyone who can rustle up $50 and a smile. I'll get a good price!

4255 2018-09-03 15:43:05 There are hydrophobic qualities but I’m wondering how this works with oil unless they’re marketing it to be sweat proof.
4256 2018-09-03 15:42:58 C'mon BC. Fox news and classy don't exactly go together. That's like water and oil. Fox news is an embarrassment.
4257 2018-09-03 15:42:55 This proves a point: EVs are replacing fuel efficient cars!   Therefore, the impact on oil demand is lower than estimated.
4258 2018-09-03 15:42:54 that idiot megalomaniac petroleum minister is busy in fulfilling his aspiration to be d CM of Odisha ,always on campaign mode ,no concerns about d oil hike

As a supporter of BJP, please take it from me. Get clues from #KarnatakaMunicipalElections 
You still have time to bring the oil prices within the reach of common man before 2019. 
Else @bjp4india will be a history.

4265 2018-09-03 15:42:30 @dpradhanbjp Sir, if the hike in international crude oil price going up n dollar exchange rate going up is the reason for hike in petrol prices, why BJP was doing nation wide agitation in 2012. Why double standard. #PetrolGST
4266 2018-09-03 15:42:28 @AMISHDEVGAN @INCIndia these people doesn't understand macro economics and starts crying foul. ₹ was overdue to depreciate and its good export will pick up. Oil prices can be still control. Promote BIO FUEL, increase blend ratio @PetroleumMin @BJP4India

4273 2018-09-03 15:41:22 The reason it would seem to me for Putin opposing Scotland remaining or rejoining the EU must be that Scotland would be a stable source of oil & gas into the EU (UK) both from Scotland's oil fields and via Norway thus ensuring the EU is not as dependant on Russia for its supply.

are often similiar.
are often identical.
are often word for word.

Remember when Bush stole the oil?
4308 2018-09-03 15:39:26 The problem was they rely on oil as their main export and the price of oil dropped in 2014. A dynamic robust economy should be more diverse and that can’t all be blamed on the socialist government of the time but their response to the plummeting price of oil can be.

4320 2018-09-03 15:38:30 That hateful is you thinking others don't have the right to take care of their own health. Billionaires don't NEED extra money so why do we give the oil industry 50 billon+ of OUR TAXES? That money alone would pay for healthcare & education
Blame Billionaires
4321 2018-09-03 15:38:27 No one.its not in their control.oil imported, refined by oil companies.prices fixed by them.govt add taxes.ur question itself wrong.ask oil companies why not they reduce overheads cost?

4329 2018-09-03 15:37:39 #86TooMuch | OPEC had said to increase the production of oil by one mn barrel per day but it has been two months, but they have not done this so far. The situation in Iran has also made situation tensed and they are also a factor for the hike in fuel prices: Dharmendra Pradhan
4330 2018-09-03 15:37:30 #86TooMuch | Today, there is a surge in the price of crude oil in the international market. Other currencies of the world have weakened in comparison to the Dollar, which also has an impact on the Indian currency. Hence, all this is temporary: Dharmendra Pradhan
4331 2018-09-03 15:37:26 Pure Honey & Pure Olive Oil come in their own bottles then why one would have them in empty bottles of wine? You can't even trust private institutions in Sindh.They are all under influence of Sindh Govt n political parties. There is no law in Sindh.

4354 2018-09-03 15:35:16 So, 4 yrs before prices of fuel,education, food & health care were world standard ?

4356 2018-09-03 15:35:07 There isn't an oversupply in the oil market. Japan switches to another supplier, meaning the people who use to go to that supplier will have to find another source. Leading then to buy from Iran. 

Unless a vast majority of nations boycott Iranian oil the effect will be minimal.
4357 2018-09-03 15:34:56 Navika stop doing dalali for modi ji. In the last 3 years world has witnessed the lowest oil prices on international market & prices went down by half when compared to the oil prices at UPA's time still petrol has crossed 85 mark under modi . Shame

4362 2018-09-03 15:34:30 Coconut oil got a repulsive ass taste and smell and I would recommend it to no one but the crackheads of the world.
4363 2018-09-03 15:34:28 @realDonaldTrump If we understand that India has been exempted, we will react very strongly and this is not good for you near the election. We repeatedly said that we would not tolerate the exemption from oil sanctions
4364 2018-09-03 15:34:25 while im not nessessarly against the pipeline/oil sands, calling it "the cleanest, most ethical, environmentally-friendly energy in the world" is really reaching. it might be worst way to harvest crude in mass production as far as the environment is concerned
4365 2018-09-03 15:34:23 You have to be IN the oil business to understand decline and what 150% ROI's over ten years do to reserve replacement and sustainability. This fella does not get that. Never did. Reserve growth does not "prove" anything. The LTO industry would not exist but for credit/debt.
4366 2018-09-03 15:34:16 Their wines changes into olive oil and honey .believe me my water honey does not change into even into wine

4371 2018-09-03 15:33:52 It never looked like alcohol to begin with. Vodka never looks like olive oil nor whiskey the colour of pure honey. CJ was looking for any excuse to send Sharjeel back to prison. He has no work but to do raids. Wish he would raid the pending 5000 cases in Supreme Court.
4372 2018-09-03 15:33:38 The Saudi gamble a few years ago hit the oil sector along with its high yield debt quite hard but did not cause an overall bear market. What’s different this time?
4373 2018-09-03 15:33:38 Can I recommend to drench you in oil first and lit you up in fire for a more dramatic fall into the wolf pit?

Also, this sound a lot more like a threat than a funeral brainstorm so I'm going to stop.

4388 2018-09-03 15:32:15 BJP is salting away the oil taxes so that come the elections, they can reduce the prices and be hailed as heroes.

4395 2018-09-03 15:31:16 Congress gave subsidy to oil PSU's, whereas BJP has made them self dependent and profitable. In the long run, BJP'S oil price management is better.
4396 2018-09-03 15:31:16 A 747 is over 250’ long and can be operated by 2 or 3 people. An oil tanker can be up to 1,500 feet long and operated by fewer than 20 people. 

The length of vessel has absolutely nothing to do with required crew.
4397 2018-09-03 15:31:11 Steam Locomotives may come back. When fossil oil  and coal  exhausts solar panels on the train will  heat the water to make steam and run the steam engine
4398 2018-09-03 15:31:07 A healthy alternative to vegetable oil for cooking is high-quality virgin coconut oil.
4399 2018-09-03 15:31:07 Name the lie ? She genuinely thinks rail is safer than a pipeline. I doubt she has a clue about the Fraser River and how many derailments it has seen. One tanker car derailment regardless of the composition of the oil product in it would be a calamity .
4400 2018-09-03 15:31:04 Can India negotiate better terms from USA? Smuggled crude oil will continue to be there
4401 2018-09-03 15:31:03 Even more though, we can use all those complex plant polymers to make other carbon based chemistry - reducing the oil and gas used in petrochemical industry. This all ultimately ends in atmosphere, oceans or ‘plastosphere’

Those ships and aircraft are worth a few bucks.  

I'm not discounting oil and minerals as motives.

4420 2018-09-03 15:29:53 #RRE - if you model commodity spot for 10 years which is clearly not realistic then the move in gas/oil in last month is a 30% upgrade to cumulative gross cash flows from p1&p2 from 2018 to 2028....From $1bn to $1.3bn. Cheap share
4421 2018-09-03 15:29:46 Do people really use palm oil and groundnut oil???????????
4422 2018-09-03 15:29:22 No what he is saying is that papers are not holy grails. Even the best researched papers can go wrong. In the face of overwhelming real life evidence this paper doesn't offer much. "pure poison" is obvious BS. More than a billion people using coconut oil are performing suicide?!

4425 2018-09-03 15:29:12 All of these tests performed are irrelevant. To determine honey, HMF & sugar profile etc is determined. For olive oil, it’s FFA & fatty acid profile etc need to be performed.

4438 2018-09-03 15:28:11 I appreciate your framing of this as her trying to broaden or expand her culture. Her efforts to make otjize after she leaves earth - I was surprised it, too, "worked." (I was glad she noted that the replacement oil had the same chemical structure.) #BintiBookClub

4515 2018-09-03 15:20:59 Still you insist for the names then If I again visit to Indian Oil and HP petrol pumps, I will definitely write the name and forward you. Till the time I will use Bharat Petroleum. Other Avenger bikers may not have complained about that but they may have moved to BPCL. Think.
4516 2018-09-03 15:20:58 don't forget to put almond oil on your cuticles !!!!
4517 2018-09-03 15:20:55 You're proud of these accomplishments.  More oil drilling, less consumer protections, and a huge deficit.

4519 2018-09-03 15:20:39 But they have brought the issue of IMF which is on paper on collateral levied on tax as agreed. They have been  a postponement on its implementation.
So sad  oil tax VAT will pronouse insult to an already existing injury. #OpposeVAT

4521 2018-09-03 15:20:30 American Pickers is a show wherein two snake oil salesmen travel the country robbing from hoarders and then selling their ill gotten wares to gullible fools.

4526 2018-09-03 15:20:07 They took or stole is a better word, mineral and below grade rights from land owners, packaged access to below grade, and Oil and Gas purchased those rights--Pennsylvania Artesian well poisoning by fracking and line boring.  They bought access rights by Extraction Profit share
4527 2018-09-03 15:20:07 No to oil but yes to coal. 
4528 2018-09-03 15:20:05 That we went through <$40 oil in 2015 means there's been a bit of a stress test / test run on this, no? 

And it's viewed as high yield debt, not "safe" as mortgages in 07', so far less holding the debt with borrowed debt if it does blow up. Also $300bn of 6T total corp debt

4535 2018-09-03 15:19:24 Can’t check upsurge in global price of crude oil & its resultant adverse impact on India.Instead start campaign to save fuel-both petrol & diesel and to give push 2 use of  transport transport & cycle/ foot path developments.Encourage meetings vide V.C or in States @narendramodi
4536 2018-09-03 15:19:16 Even hypothetically if we find millions of barrells of oil it would take years to excavate it refine it transport it sell it    mean while what do we do short term how do we  retire our debt did any govt think about it .

4546 2018-09-03 15:18:19 Truth is there will be little increase in oil exports until the refining markets are satisfied along the entire pacific coast. California WA and BC have the highest fuel costs in NA and some of the highest demand.

4558 2018-09-03 15:16:52 There are other parallels between Trumpism and Putinism: the glorification of oil, gas and mining over science and technology; the elevation of white, Christian, nationalist values; and the neutering of the legislative branch /3

4560 2018-09-03 15:16:45 Agreed because oil in US is a different commodity than oil in canada, different risks. The pipeline issue is not the whole story and Trudeau has tried to solve it more aggressively than others.

4587 2018-09-03 15:14:45 Great points @AmyJaffeenergy! That sort of deep recession is not impossible but seems unlikely, especially such a sharp oil price drop. Seems imp not to confuse financing issues of 2014-5 in oil patch with today. I wonder if pace of refinancings May step up ahead of 2020 times.

4601 2018-09-03 15:14:23 Given the list of cars you've owned, I can't see you keeping this longer than 3 years, absolute max, because you seem to like cars and changing things up. That said, there's no reason most of these things need to be changed (clutch, fuel filter, diff oil?) inside of 100k mi.

4604 2018-09-03 15:14:12 Nice man. I always finish it in a cast iron skillet afterwards. Add some olive oil until it starts smoking then flip it every 15 seconds for a minute n a half. I add butter and garlic during this time too. It turns out real good.

4614 2018-09-03 15:12:48 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.
4615 2018-09-03 15:12:46 You’re going to have to explain the oil thing and how it connects to this. Believing $tsla needs to raise more money does not mean believing oil is clean or greenhouse gases aren’t evil. I’m pro-reality and pro math and pro electric car. But that’s not equal to Tesla cultist.

4617 2018-09-03 15:12:35 It's about the dirt under your feet and the oil below that. It's about the $12 pizza and the $5 tip the driver will never receive. It's about the cash register with $40.13 in it that belongs to the billionaire that owns the store and pays you $7.25/hr that you'll never meet.

4619 2018-09-03 15:12:21 Ok. For the sake of elections if we need to bring down oil prices n maybe by GST so be it but I am all for higher price for petrol generally if that gives revenue to the govt particularly a govt that's working for us

4640 2018-09-03 15:11:02 And for the LOW INCOME families. You show me solar panels a low income family can afford. Coal is an acceptable energy source and inexpensive. Remember when one of the Kennedys made a deal with Hugo Chavez for heating oil? Developed societies demand dependable energy.
4641 2018-09-03 15:10:53 This sounds like the 70s, when linoleum, oil and base board heat and fake wood paneling was the the way of the future. Oh and flammable carpet
4642 2018-09-03 15:10:52 Listing out costs that most consumers do not pay is not a good compare.  How many lease cars for three years and their only maintain is about four oil changes and fuel...  I have spent under $1000 for Volt maint., inclu tires over 90k miles over 6 yrs.
4643 2018-09-03 15:10:35 Nonsense!

We import oil in the East.

We export oil in the West

The #TMX is in the West and has nothing to do with either Saudi oil or exporting oil from Canada.

Is there common ground, or am I imagining this?

4656 2018-09-03 15:09:46 If memory serves, Judas used reasoning like this when a woman washed and anointed Jesus' feet with scented oil - he objected on grounds that it was a luxury which might have been better spent on other things. But Jesus set him straight.  Look it up. Here endeth the lesson.

4686 2018-09-03 15:07:17 The oil will continue to move, by rail...which frequently follows waterways. And it will still then head south via tankers. It’s crazy thinking the environmental argument can be used FOR the pipeline in its journey overland while then completely ignoring the marine impact.
4687 2018-09-03 15:07:16 Sure - why does Norway run a surplus - even in times of depressed oil prices ?

4765 2018-09-03 15:00:49 Absolutely, Japan has been way too soft, that only encourages the chinese to up the ante. They are entering the territorial waters of the Senkakus with impunity which is unacceptable and they keep bringing more oil rigs to the disputed area in the EEZ median line.
4766 2018-09-03 15:00:48 Down to their use of remote neural monitoring software, stealing from banks, the budget, controlling the brains and limiting the population’s movements.

4783 2018-09-03 14:59:18 Spot on. What with windfall gains from low oil prices. Wasted the first year trying to fix the land acquisition bill that they had screwed up while they were in the opposition.
4784 2018-09-03 14:59:17 They need to encourage more electric cars, both to reduce importing oil and for cleaning the air. They should reduce the import tariff on all-electrics to zero, and increase the tariff on non-electrics to pay for the lost revenue.

4787 2018-09-03 14:59:07 Some of the world's richest people are rich because of crude oil so they're lost if they think it's a bad thing

4799 2018-09-03 14:57:39 Trump is borrowing more money from the Treasury since 2009.
National debt at record levels
Inflation on the rise
Gas/oil prices up
middle-class wages down

Trump is one big bust
4800 2018-09-03 14:57:31 What causes blockage of a catalyst?
There are several causes which includes: Fuel additives, bad fuel or leaded fuel, engine oil over-guage, rust etc. @ALIBABAGCFR
4801 2018-09-03 14:57:27 I actually took today off because it’s Labor Day; of course I am at the mechanic for an oil leak. I got here at 7:35am. 
4802 2018-09-03 14:57:23 Who the hell keeps honey in a cork whiskey bottle and olive oil in a grey goose bottle

4804 2018-09-03 14:56:50 It’s from working in the oil field for 5 years. Was awake before 5am everyyyy day. But I’ve woke up before 7am my entire lyfe lmaoooooo
4805 2018-09-03 14:56:45 Pretty clearly Chavez made things much worse (driven in significant by his crazy oil policy), but Venezuela was already in distress prior to his election in 1998.  In fact, the history of the country in the 20th century is full of coups, oil busts, etc.
4806 2018-09-03 14:56:43 ทำไมช่วงนี้ฝันถึงแต่คนในอดีต ที่ไม่ได้อยู่ในชีวิตปัจจุบันแล้ว เออ พอฝันถึงมันเลยคิดถึง แต่พอคิดถึงแล้วมันทำอะไรไม่ได้ ความทรมานจึงเกิด นี่นอยด์มาทั้งวัน อยากทัก อยากคุย แต่รู้ว่าไม่ควร เลยต้องปล่อยให้มันทรมานอยู่แบบนี้!!
4807 2018-09-03 14:56:37 No, no -- not at all.  For many of us, it's oil (olive if we're lucky, cod liver if we're not).
4808 2018-09-03 14:56:31 Are you talking about the oil or my virginity?
4809 2018-09-03 14:56:31 เลิกกะแฟนยาง
4810 2018-09-03 14:56:30 Our government wants their oil. To the US government that makes it ok to do ehatever it takes to get that oil(and prevent Venezuela from becoming a successful leftist economy, that cannot be allowed. It goes against capitalist propaganda)
4811 2018-09-03 14:56:24 Yes, actually. Crude oil is the most sought after natural resource in the world.
4812 2018-09-03 14:56:24 Consider that Cosby Show is not being aired anywhere, so royalties have ceased. My gifted (oil on canvas)artist husband once worked in a factory. Artists often need side gigs. It’s not uncommon at all. #GeoffreyOwens is a fine, fine man.

4816 2018-09-03 14:56:11 You are correct for crude oil.  Incorrect for refined products.  Jet fuel is a refined product.  Just trying to help you
4817 2018-09-03 14:55:55 So what! It’s not their (governments) money. Why just oil companies why not lottery winners. Prices go up supply will increase. Clamp down on the profit you’ll get less investment into future production Besides your mandarins will just squander the proceeds
4818 2018-09-03 14:55:51 Chillis with garlic and oil and smashed up and probably laced with a bit of fish sauce and sugar and coriander and whatnot
4819 2018-09-03 14:55:39 Yes, Royingya minority needs to be protected & helped. What are the U.N. & the oil rich Muslim countries doing to help? It should not only fall on Bangladesh to offer sanctuary!
4820 2018-09-03 14:55:33 Maybe adding oil is the way to go.. Or i should change to dewy

4824 2018-09-03 14:55:04 #RRE reality is that ebitda guidance & therefore cash flow;  given oil at $78 and UK gas at 69.63 then, must be top end of range. Am amazed stock ignored oil/gas price. Shares ultimately about production stability, value of p1&p2 but here and now should be higher on commodities
4825 2018-09-03 14:55:03 And Sharjeel Memon has won 2018 football  World Cup, Sharjeel Memon qualified for Golden Shoe/boot.

Sharjeel said in an interview to Omar Qureshi : its all because of Honey & Oil.
4826 2018-09-03 14:54:47 I’m sure you’re right. But it’s a standard way to measure oil quantities. Like how we follow OPEC prices in dollars per barrel.
4827 2018-09-03 14:54:46 Jo Grey Goose ki bottle mein cooking oil deta hai, usko b shaheed karo!!!
4828 2018-09-03 14:54:46 The Sugar import wars ended quietly.
Now we're on Oil import wars.
4829 2018-09-03 14:54:41 Please tell me how drilling in our national parks is going to help hard working families. What to help big oil rape our lands for 2 years of work
4830 2018-09-03 14:54:38 in case of Altaf Hussain, a police like scotland yard was politicised. 
Agha khan lab can make any report you want. especially living a doing biznis in Sindh. it is also reported that the botles contained HONEY and OIL. bottles and blood gone. no one can find samples anymore.

4832 2018-09-03 14:54:37 Used a blend of baking soda and coconut oil for years.
4833 2018-09-03 14:54:32 btw, the key question to me, which I didn't articulate well in the oped (hopefully better in the book), is how much oil America would produce if companies also had to deliver a return to shareholders.
4834 2018-09-03 14:54:19 PPP ne na sirf yeh saabit kiya ke Sharjeel Memon ke blood mein alcohol nahi balke yeh bhi saabit kiya ke 'sharab' ki bottles mein cooking oil aur shehad tha. Yeh unn logon ke munh pe tamancha hai jo kehte hain Sindh government kisi kaam ki nahi. Class!
4835 2018-09-03 14:54:19 Cut off the oil supply and see how fast your tune changes
4836 2018-09-03 14:54:18 Let' Sharjeel  have a visit to CJ s chamber Tit for Tat and discover olive oil and honey

4840 2018-09-03 14:53:22 Oil companies should also offer fodder at petrol pumps now. If we are all going to switch to bail-gaadi then we will need fodder available all over town.
Diesel at 71 and rising may force the middle class to move to cheaper options anyway.
4841 2018-09-03 14:53:17 Need to oil Mother soon. Get all the hard-to-reach places.
4842 2018-09-03 14:53:08 Investment in technologies that reduced consumption of oil. Part of that would be public investment, the other part is private investment which requires lower interest rates and healthy demand so that businesses actually do invest

Killing inflation by raising unemployment is bad

4851 2018-09-03 14:52:11 @chelseaperetti 

Don't put yoghurt in pancakes.

Here, have a real recipe: 
250 gram flower
some salt
500 ml milk
2 big eggs.
some cinnamon.
1 apple microrasped
some olive oil (regular, not extra virgin)

Serves 2-3 persons.

Thank me later.
4852 2018-09-03 14:52:00 If I stop using extra virgin coconut oil, will I stop being a virgin?
4853 2018-09-03 14:51:57 Imagine I get up at 6, make breakfast, oil up my legs (in case I meet the loml ofc), pack snacks AND alternate shoes, get to school hours before my first class and then realise I don't even have a pen.
4854 2018-09-03 14:51:42 It’s apparent even in the time ive lived here. Fuel price had gone from under 90c litre to around 1.35€ a litre. This is not just caused world oil price fluctuations.

4858 2018-09-03 14:51:29 Correct in that we wouldn't have to burn oil or gas but we will still need it for petrochemicals... plastics etc,
4859 2018-09-03 14:51:28 All I think is to do something first. Yes, I  became the first Nigerian to do hydrate remediation in Nigeria's oil field, what next? Still thinking. #unsung heroes  @atiku

4864 2018-09-03 14:50:42 6/There are scores of economists & analysts who have never worked a day in O&G business heralding tight oil an advance equal to agricultural or industrial revolutions. Tight oil is an advance for sure, possibly in same class as microwave ovens. Get a grip guys & read history.
4865 2018-09-03 14:50:29 Sharjeel like all leaders of PPP is innocent. He has never seen a bottle of wine what to talk of consuming one. CJ made a big mistake by finding something other than oil & honey in bottles. He must opologise for blaming an angle like person sharjeel

4871 2018-09-03 14:49:55 Peta mostly gives ridiculous statements basically all these NGO have hidden agenda of promoting Christianity they never counter Islam due to fear but never leave opportunity to humiliate Hindu by suggesting that serving oil fat from cow milk is not eco friendly & must be stopped.

4899 2018-09-03 14:47:16 In 2014 April, crude oil price - 105 US dollars/barrel. Petrol price in India - 74 rupees. In 2018 August, crude oil price - 77 US dollars/barrel, petrol price - 81 rupees.
4900 2018-09-03 14:47:07 I support social democracy. A mixed market economy, not full on socialism.

We need a small dose of socialism in order to save capitalism.

It doesnt help that Venezuela was sanctioned to hell and solely depended on oil.

4909 2018-09-03 14:45:47 Agree, @RTDukes. Another single comparison that puts all shale projects together. HUGE difference in gas vs oil commodity markets. CHK debt was raised as Henry Hub lost circa 75% of its value from peak on a constant slide. WTI would need go to $25 to have a similar price impact.

4919 2018-09-03 14:45:09 I think it's just *another* Big Oil coup à la 1950s.
4920 2018-09-03 14:45:07 Shame on the local Oxford car dealership that tries to scare a 17-year-old girl getting an oil change. Shame. Good to know the whole business lives up to the family reputation. Lost our business today.
4921 2018-09-03 14:44:57 Bila baca balik hada labo oil cleanser ingredients mcm ok..pelik pulak sy kenapa
4922 2018-09-03 14:44:56 #86toomuch Debates on Indian channels is ridiculous-regular panelists who just scream,try to outshout as if in a rally. Price of oil is going through the roof and the inability to control it shall only be considered an excuse.Oil Cos are making huge profits n so r state govts.
4923 2018-09-03 14:44:56 @FinMinIndia can you wake up please the oil price is sky high and govt is sleeping on it. Petrol diesel not be covered under GST and taxes reduced below 18%?
4924 2018-09-03 14:44:54 What a load of nonsense! Holder in many oil companies, have no objection to demonstrations. The court order doesn’t stop this, it stops all the nonsense that comes with it. Maybe we should block these idiots in to stop them getting home and see how they like it when obstructed.
4925 2018-09-03 14:44:52 So if we had this wouldn't need gas or oil
4926 2018-09-03 14:44:47 Just in time for the former processors of Iranian oil
4927 2018-09-03 14:44:32 Almost 1am. The dude who steals stuff including cooking oil is back visiting the shops I live near.

4930 2018-09-03 14:44:00 In 2017 around Dec some Kenyans wanted a break from politics. Most of them said election is a day. You are back to politics! Oil is fueling it.
4931 2018-09-03 14:43:48 Oil and wheat are what we import mostly from Canada
4932 2018-09-03 14:43:47 I would like the 2 essential oil books & whered u go Bernadette.
4933 2018-09-03 14:43:46 Iran can afford to be defiant  its got oil   a large country with a manageble  population highly nationalistic a huge diaspora a huge religious  boundary in countries like lebanon Iraq expanding via converts do we have any such advantage unfortunately no .
4934 2018-09-03 14:43:46 I grew up using baby oil & iodine as did my sisters who are more olive toned than I.  They never got that dark and we lived on the beach in the summers.
4935 2018-09-03 14:43:43 humiliated oil heater makes you plastered
4936 2018-09-03 14:43:34 With rupee and oil on a boil, inflation inching up, god bless the people or award them with Nobel prize, who still have a vision for new India

4938 2018-09-03 14:43:22 interesting and she's a great reporter..BUT 2015 means people know about energy debt delta to oil price; fracking debt is a small % of total debt; and the debt is perceived as HY unlike 2007 mortgages so it's not heavily in levered funds
4939 2018-09-03 14:43:19 Mare kheyal say sharjeel memen ko gand marwane ki adat hia zeton ka oil lagaa k us ne gand marwani hoti hia or ye chef sahib ne kia kar dia hia rahi hony ki baat wo jis say gand marwata hia sharjeel wo hony kha k marta hia gand sharjeel agy ap khud samjdaar hia
4940 2018-09-03 14:43:16 Some of the wampies are on unemployment (and other)  benefits paid by the tax payers that has included oil companies extracting resources in North sea. How many of these have declined getting benefit monies because part of it came from oil money. Bloody HYPOCRITES!!!!
4941 2018-09-03 14:43:08 about 20 years ago, i met an old slovakian dude, man did he have some stories, escaped the soviet union by swimming across a river in the dead of night, flew helicopters as a kgb agent etc

anyways, he turned me onto "oil of oregano"
i have not had a cold or flu since..!
4942 2018-09-03 14:43:05 my manager say, engineer around 89/90 can get around 2.5k at that time. if oil and gas engineer easily reach around 4,5k.
4943 2018-09-03 14:42:51 Crystal clear oil too and let's not forget the honey with 0 viscosity
4944 2018-09-03 14:42:42 So how did that work out for Alberta?.... 35 years of giving it away and Alberta has zip to show for it... even at $100 oil and Harper in power for 10 years Alberta was in deficit.... and now Alberta wants a National oil program with Energy East..
4945 2018-09-03 14:42:38 GTM: There are already four million EV cars worldwide. 

We'll Never Run Out of Oil — But Will Stop Using it Anyway.
4946 2018-09-03 14:42:38 Not sure, why u would need a bread maker? Some yeast, warm water, bread flour, semolina (suji in hindi, didn't know that lol), salt and olive oil are enough to make a focaccia bread. U can also add rosemary to it. Also, I am thinking to substitute White bread flour with Spelt.
4947 2018-09-03 14:42:37 Trickle down doesn’t work-it didn’t work last time-it didn’t work this time-it won’t work the next time some snake oil salesman tries the same ‘ole “if corporations had more money-wages will go up”
They use it on buy backs and improving manufacturing that require LESS employees
4948 2018-09-03 14:42:35 having a car is cool until you have to get an oil change..or an inspection...or a registration stickers...or new tires...or pay for gas.

4956 2018-09-03 14:41:56 Olive oil in your hair is a terrible experience you have been warned
4957 2018-09-03 14:41:53 Yes, 500,000 barrels of oil each day is moved safely through the Straight of Juan de Fuca from Alaska to the Seattle area.
4958 2018-09-03 14:41:47 There is large 2020 debt exposure if major recession were to hit then but it would have to take oil down to under $30 and be sustained for more than a year. PE firms might be squeezed. publicly traded firms who would see recession coming and likely hedge, staving losses

4971 2018-09-03 14:40:06 Please help me out, i’m in my inlaw’s house and my mother in law asked me to cook fried rice for her, i have boiled the rice, added pepper, maggi, palm oil, salt and small sugar, what else should i add? I really want to impress her.
4972 2018-09-03 14:40:02 Where above did you see anything about doing it myself? Oil changes are $100 dude.
4973 2018-09-03 14:40:02 Reduce tax on fuel and do what? Start taxing your shows? What a ridiculous statement.

Our highest import bill is spent on oil, instead of reducing taxes why not pressure government to run public transport on alternate energy to not have any impact on common people

4977 2018-09-03 14:39:10 Test karne wale bhi aapki tarah doctors honge. Also now the chemical examiner has said the decanter and bottle contained honey and olive oil. My point was if someone is a crook, produce evidence sentence them. Wasting time with who has had/not had alcohol or coke waste of time.
4978 2018-09-03 14:39:04 When they blow up pipelines, your parasitic president will go and beg them. It is their entitlement. Your state and people rely on the revenue from their oil.
4979 2018-09-03 14:39:03 5/Rig count vs. production growth is another "mystical thing trotted out for years" by shale gas & tight oil advocates. 
Rigs don't produce oil, wells do. Look at well count--it increased at higher rate than output. 
Greater efficiency? Sure but never see it in balance sheets!

4992 2018-09-03 14:37:29 “Trump doesn't talk about the "forgotten man" much anymore.
@RichardTrumka explained why:
-tax cuts went to his boss
-his health care, gas prices up
-no infrastructure plan
-worker health and safety rule rollbacks affecting mine safety, offshore oil rigs & meat processing plants”
4993 2018-09-03 14:37:26 Ruling politicians for last 40 years are of the views that it takes no difference whether it is vine in the bottles or there is pure honey & Olive Oil. The only issue in the country is IMRAN KHAN who is depriving them for such practices & wants welfare for common man. Dahandli .

Is that not capable for fulfill India demands for few months?????
4998 2018-09-03 14:36:53 That's not the priority. Tell Modi  to check oil price and falling rupee. Economy ki band baja di.

5000 2018-09-03 14:36:44 But output and revenues must be up many times that since 2005 anyway. Some context first please. Sector has seen huge FcF, especially when oil was higher than this
5001 2018-09-03 14:36:14 It smells very strongly of sesame oil upstairs

5004 2018-09-03 14:35:59 So ive managed to farm around 10% of the coal needed to purchase the Musashi. and all of that without any clan to change oil into coal.
And thats quite impressive if i might say so.
5005 2018-09-03 14:35:34 The other thing that struck me was when walking across a new parking lot, noticing all the oil stains all over already. We just assume it’s normal until we realize that it really isn’t and that it doesn’t have to be like that.
5006 2018-09-03 14:35:31 Glaxo Smith Kline charges hundreds a month, says a NYT blog, for Lavazo, a fish oil. Besides the toxic karma of being involved in fish suffocation, ocean fish oil
has invisible radiation which is not removed.  GSK's gelatin capsules are probably derived from animal bones.

5008 2018-09-03 14:35:19 Pretty sure everyone understands that and they just feel that we should still be allowed to have good education for our kids, good healthcare, and safe and efficient infrastructure even if the price of oil is low. #ableg #medhat #abpoli #abbudget

5011 2018-09-03 14:35:06 So Alberta didn’t want Canadian ownership of our oil... we preferred foreign ownership .... cause it seems in hindsight Alberta doesn’t own any of it.... in fact have given so much of it away that it no longer contributes to the Hertitage Fund...

5014 2018-09-03 14:34:56 And how about those off shore bank accounts where Scott is hiding all those payoffs he’s received from Big Pollutors like Big Sugar & the oil companies. Scott has sold off Florida’s most precious assets, our beaches, our waters & our land. #ScottIsCorrupt
5015 2018-09-03 14:34:53 There was oil and honey in wine's bottles. Couldn't decent bottles be used OR the report has been written being drunk?
5016 2018-09-03 14:34:51 Its fine. The 2 foods to avoid if you care about the planet and animals are soya and palm oil.  Both responsible for the destruction of rainforest and loss of whole species of animals and displacement of native ppl
5017 2018-09-03 14:34:46 Iran must be regretting their move to challenge the U.S... 

Japan has followed through with the U.S.’ demand and will no longer import Iranian oil
5018 2018-09-03 14:34:38 He's the arsonist for sure. He's no firefighter. He's more like the snake oil salesman. He's not going to fix anything. He well try to convince others that he did or that it was someone else's fault.

5022 2018-09-03 14:34:11 Yes. Similarly cottonseed oil, which has the same problems. And they are mostly touted for that rather than as health food.
5023 2018-09-03 14:34:11 Are you suggesting that Tides is running a marketing campaign? That would suggest they are also running a demarketing campaign as well right? On the list of Tides initiatives in the USA how many are Canadian oil related?

5025 2018-09-03 14:33:57 that has nothing to do with his tweet, Adam.  they did not.  now they have to.  talk to oil rig workers and ask them if it's serving Bay Street.

5029 2018-09-03 14:33:45 If the Court found that oil was the most clean and environmentally friendly source of energy, @AndrewScheer, wouldn’t it have ruled otherwise? It appears that you neither understand science, nor understand Canadian law and due process. #cdnpoli @CPC_HQ #BlameGame
5030 2018-09-03 14:33:31 If the oil rich Arab countries had an ounce of integrity, they would have stepped in to tell the US leadership what it can do with its crumbs.
5031 2018-09-03 14:33:30 4/High decline rates are not necessarily a bad thing & may help NPV. But @laffngeconomist calls decline rate arguments something "peak oil advocates trotted out for years." Production growth as "proof" of success is equally wrong. Is a peak oil advocate code for something, Mike?

5043 2018-09-03 14:32:32 At 20 cents per barrel?  Not sure, but I think a barrel of oil is 42 gallons, so that's half of a penny per gallon.

Nothing fishy about that.

5047 2018-09-03 14:32:22 I thought the advantage of grapeseed oil was technical - stable at high temperatures, good for frying - more than nutritional.
5048 2018-09-03 14:32:15 Until we have our own oil
5049 2018-09-03 14:32:13 Nobody cares. It’s not like every person is going to get a bill in the mail.

5057 2018-09-03 14:31:33 The point of LOC is so deposit moisture with the liquid and cream then seal it with a sealing oil.  You can style your hair after that or you can try to do something low maintenance.  With the right products, your hair should feel moisturized for a few days.
5058 2018-09-03 14:31:28 At 20 cents per barrel?  Not sure, but I think a barrel of oil is 42 gallons, so that's half of a penny per gallon.

Nothing fishy about that.

If running a trade deficit keeps gas cheap no one seems to care, but if it was $8/gal to not run a deficit people would freak out.

5101 2018-09-03 14:27:08 3/Linking oil production rates with success is a HUGE error. The fact that the price collapse wasn't accompanied by lower output only supports the questionable business model of growth w/o concern for sound business practice or shareholders.

5193 2018-09-03 14:17:35 Men are not the same anymore.  2 men were taking up both benches in the oil change area and 3 females came in and they didn't even offer them a seat. They were older men too.

5202 2018-09-03 14:16:58 It's almost like a superpower could drill their way into prosperity AND world peace simply by increasing oil production/exports instead of bombing runs. Hmm, I wonder how a "RalphWiggam" figured it out :)

5213 2018-09-03 14:15:59 The moment I took off my apron to leave work, everyone started approaching and ask; “Do you have essentials oil?” “Do sell hand towel?” Fuck ya’ll I want to go home and no, I don’t sell any of those.

5215 2018-09-03 14:15:43 Having National resources which can pay for it , we need State owned Health service and #Education system under the State.Without that society will be controlled by Salafist Business Cartels. #OIL & #GAS must be exploited with State control and tight legal system for revenues.
5216 2018-09-03 14:15:37 Ven had oil, look at the wealth of other oil states?? yes we have gold but our mines are unprofitable due to high labour. If a state had such revenues perhaps it could be argued, but you cannot blame commodity prices when a plan fails, Fluctuations are an economic reality!
5217 2018-09-03 14:15:33 Part 2 of GERS annually the U.K. collected £469billion of Oil revenue.

Even IF Oil only lasted another 40yrs that Oil would give Scotland 240yrs worth of what you Unionists think we need annually to run our Country...if we somehow didn’t make the £45 billion in revenue.

The relief granted to public recently by way of reduction in oil prices has been taken back by way of increase in electricity prices.
5224 2018-09-03 14:14:45 All I want is truth. The scam of Climate Change doesnt qualify. The faked data has been proven but the fake news has offered up big oil as a boogeyman to try to give the believers hope that the scam is not really a scam.
5225 2018-09-03 14:14:12 Untill God give us our own oil like Opec members,petroleun. Will always goes up
5226 2018-09-03 14:14:03 I agree. This is not a discussion of ending fossil fuels, but rather a discussion about a better energy plan for the future of . Producing more oil at an increasing rate & wasting it out our tailpipes is insanity when clearly we have better options today & tomorrow

5235 2018-09-03 14:13:23 What we have done is started with the Rick Simpson recipe. Nothing is the same after that. We aspies learned how to condense it without burning it which means that our oil is much more potent since it can be condensed much more. Thus the Extreme oil. (Not for diabetics BTW)

5244 2018-09-03 14:12:29 Coal, oil and gas do more than produce power. They are used to make over 6000 products. Wind and solar have a hard time producing only power. We can not keep fossil fuels in the ground without humanity suffering.
5245 2018-09-03 14:12:16 Florida - "the sunshine state" -should be one of the solar power capitals of the world. Instead our hidebound political & business leaders have us wedded still to dirty energy (oil, gas, coal). Time for progressive change, people. #flapol #FLGov
