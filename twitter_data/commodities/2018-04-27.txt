3 2018-04-29 23:37:04 Isn't this what the Howard Govt did at the height of the commodities boom, and since then the majority of economists have argued that this action weakened the revenue raising base, a major factor which has caused our recent fiscal difficulties? What now?

6 2018-04-29 22:59:20 With enough MONEY you don’t have to bother unlocking closed doors, you can just create new doors and pathways to the commodities.  ABUNDANCE for the masses will not create “Inflation.”
7 2018-04-29 22:49:24 We do understand that prison slavery is not just the labor, but also the fact that every "body" in prison is being profited off of. Prisoners are the commodities.

11 2018-04-29 22:30:37 Yup but that might be decades away. What about 10 years from today? Surely some cryptocurrencies will become multi-trillion dollar money-like commodities
12 2018-04-29 22:24:06 Eu nunca disse nada disso e o preço de um produto depende de muita coisa, principalmente para exportar, obviamente já que somente exportamos commodities precisamos fazer com que o preço seja o menor para que possamos ganhar o mercado +
13 2018-04-29 22:22:44 Commodities tend to outperform late in the business cycle. That's the Canadian story. Australia, just same. Both countries didn't even have a glimpse of the recession back in 2008. All thanks to China.

15 2018-04-29 22:05:51 EU farmers as you well realise- firstly we import 45% so let's get that cheaper from elsewhere and secondly the tariffs that affect U.K. most are on input commodities like Maize Molasses and Soy!- Dairy and high quality meat is mainly affected by feed costs - we import that!
16 2018-04-29 22:04:19 I saw the Brand New: Art and Commodities in the 1980s. …great to see so many of the artists important in my college days. The curation of the show is interesting but considering the “new” take I’m surprised by some omissions. (They were upstairs in the show Absence. Clever?)

36 2018-04-29 21:38:48 El otro equilibrio es un nuevo sistema de precios relativos. Aquí por ejemplo entre 1970 y 1998 el salario mínimo osciló entre $40 y$60, entre 1998 y 2013 se triplicó a unos $200 sin drama alguno. Creo que hasta el próximo boom de commodities, ése será el valor de equilibrio.

38 2018-04-29 21:20:03 When you say commodity-backed, do you mean the issuing institution actually holds commodities? Or does it merely try to track the price of commodities? (The ducat actually does the latter.)

41 2018-04-29 21:00:16 En la convertibilidad era lo mismo, la base monetaria no podía superar la cantidad de reservas del Central, y los políticos siempre van a encontrarle la vuelta, bonos, letras o lo q se te ocurra y además nunca vas a ser competitivo y lo único q vas a exportar es commodities.
42 2018-04-29 20:19:51 So their being is contained within the commodities they "consume" as the negative being of a void is in the matter which circumscribes it. Since liberal-democracy is nihilism, consumers resolve the nothingness of being through self-commodification which ultimately alienates them.
43 2018-04-29 20:17:23 Sunday nite calls, corn, soybean, wheat mixed . Trade talks with China this week.Midwest  planting progress is brisk. May 10th crop report next key event. Brazil ‘s Second corn crop suffering.  China absent from buying U.S. soybeans.#trade#china#planting#weather
44 2018-04-29 20:16:50 They have themselves become commodities (concretized ideology) by the decommodification of commodities into relics, or cultural hecceities, through consumption. From the ideology of the relics they construct their self as an assemblage of relics.
45 2018-04-29 20:15:23 L'Argentina non ha un decimo del sistema produttivo italiano. Esporta commodities, che sono prezzate in dollari. La crisi argentina è stata causata dal peg del peso con il dollaro, non dalle svalutazioni del peso.

48 2018-04-29 20:03:37 Se restringisse o crédito numa crise internacional entraríamos em recessão.Mas confesso que o Lula teve muita sorte , pois em 2008 o valor das commodities estava bombando no mercado internacional.Dilma tentou a mesma coisa em 2014 fazendo uma renúncia fiscal absurda e se lascou
49 2018-04-29 19:58:04 To get it you need $=87 or lower to reach this kind of a growth (quadruple $ bottom(?)... I'm still on the bear side exit on the red triangle, giving 25% chances we're going to see this pattern, or break $ below 87 means commodities will just raise quickly together with yields.
50 2018-04-29 19:57:24 I'm so baffled too. If commodities didn't just pop up out of the ground by itself (sic), then why doesn't Chamber of Mines just pack up and go?
51 2018-04-29 19:39:45 Take heart!  They go for the highest bidder. You can try Ogo_ _ they have cheaper commodities in the market.

54 2018-04-29 19:07:14 When marriages and relationships in Nigeria is meant to look like someone is acquiring a property why wont they keep treat u ladies like properties? Men will alwayz feel entitled to ladies for as long as they keep being commodities and dependent
55 2018-04-29 18:58:29 - Per MS, month end rebalancing should see:

56 2018-04-29 18:54:41 I nuovi mercati dove investire?Commodities? Land.....grabbing? Speculazioni old style! Sono gli unici investimenti ad oggi che permettono profitti maggiori rispetto ai prodotti finanziari in commercio!
57 2018-04-29 18:50:33 We will always remember Rusty, and light a candle for him. So sorry we couldn’t save you darling, one day all of this will stop, and all greyhounds will be treating as pets, not commodities. 
58 2018-04-29 18:37:55 The Farmers get empowered... to toil for the cartels and barons in the commodities markets. No one really cares that passionately about farmers.
59 2018-04-29 18:32:14 all the "accomplishments" of  capitalism are really just the product of "unlimited" dirt cheap energy from coal/oil

capitalist society pissed away that energy on war, shitty commodities, and the upkeep of our evil hierarchical system

oh and on destroying the environment too ofc
60 2018-04-29 18:26:38 How you know I deal in "commodities"?
61 2018-04-29 18:18:06 by the way, on behalf of my Kashmiri sisters and mothers, Kashmiri women aren't commodities. #Kashmiri people are not slaves to peoples whims or desires. Kashmir knows her peoples, everyone of them. Kashmir belongs to her peoples from every inch of Jammu & Kashmir. #ajk #gilgit
62 2018-04-29 18:12:14 Most people on Earth live in a “Poor” country and its even worst for them.  But if you allow people to acquire HUGE wealth quickly, they will find a way to expand the amount of commodities in the world.
63 2018-04-29 18:08:23 Closing border is a priority for national security and economic development, 1) yes, we cant produce all commodities but we should produce the ones we can
2) improving border surveillance and security is an important component for peace in Nigeria
64 2018-04-29 18:04:15 treating people like sexual commodities and not, you know, people, is also not socialist. this vaguely lefty stuff doesn't cut it
65 2018-04-29 18:02:47 Gee—Ya Think?!  It’s a No-Brainer—As Interest Rates Continue to Rise—So Too- will The Dollar & Bond Yields, as Bond Prices, Commodities & Eventually Stocks-Move Lower!!
66 2018-04-29 18:01:47 Trump&theDoc. From observing him these many months, I truly know that most ppl are but disposable commodities (tissues) to Trump. He sucked the doc into giving him a fab health report.. and now he wants to flush him bec Doc was making demands or Trump Is pre-emptively  draining
67 2018-04-29 17:57:10 Stamina and availability one of the hottest commodities nowadays.
68 2018-04-29 17:40:13 That should be highlighted in our CVs as an achievement:
"Survived 2008-09 in Zimbabwe, thanks to my exceptional kiya kiyaring and adaptation skills. A whole clan depended on me for basic commodities, showing  my ability to work under extreme pressure with no supervision."
69 2018-04-29 17:33:31 sexy commodities
70 2018-04-29 17:22:56 This debate is nuts. Women’s bodies are not commodities that men have a right of access to. There may be some women in sex work well paid and have full control of their services. However this is not the case for most women. Vulnerable & desperate women are used & abused by men
71 2018-04-29 17:22:05 Wow. My reaction is "of course this happened (and happens)." When people are putting guns to their daughters' heads to have sex for money in this country, of course women are commodities.
72 2018-04-29 17:20:19 These govt hospital employees have the ahankara of having a permanent job. They don't give a damn about patients. Treat patients like commodities.
73 2018-04-29 17:14:35 Los resultados positivos que se obtuvieron en materia económica fueron en su mayor parte consecuencia de los precios de los commodities. El argumento de que crecimos más que Argentina y Brasil es nefasto, sus gobiernos populistas fueron lamentables.
74 2018-04-29 17:06:37 Eli is burnt toast, RBs are replaceable commodities.  Several good RBs were available in the second and third round.  QB class is weaker in 2019.  F Grade clearer after five or six Eli weeks in 2018.
75 2018-04-29 17:04:08 Tiveram 13 anos para fazer uma profunda reforma fiscal, tributária e política e guiar o Brasil para o futuro. Preferiram gastar todo capital político e o $ do boom das commodities em programas populistas que além de não se sustentarem destruíram a economia. Tudo pelo PODER
76 2018-04-29 16:52:42 Redistributing who gets sex?? That's disgusting. Women's bodies aren't commodities, products, or prizes to be won. Horrible!
77 2018-04-29 16:48:53 AI is intelligence that can analyse datas from behaviour patterns of viz. makets, commodities, human propensities etc. They can act under various sets of circumstances just as a very trained human would in a particular position of responsibility.
78 2018-04-29 16:30:10 It appears that way and (most) everyone convinced of it. One possibility is that the flow of money next time begins to move into a cheap asset class that protects against USD deval (commodities?) that reinforces the inflation impulse. Where might that leave the Fed?
79 2018-04-29 16:29:35 @makemytrip Had a worst experience with MMT.Highly disappointed by the service in the hotel online suites in bangalore.The room was drastically bad with dissatisfying services and commodities.i had booked a deluxe room with an AC leakage and on complaining a bucket was placed
80 2018-04-29 16:27:33 Yes it's a good standard and it's improving. Unlike in England however it isn't pumped with money. Fans aren't treated like commodities unlike u fools down south. 

Joey Barton said the same lasted Couple of months then got punted.

Warburton
Mowbray

All failed.
81 2018-04-29 16:21:49 And that's the problem. A businessman can't govern in the same way. He sees people as commodities, not people.

And Ben Carson should just go away. What a wreck
82 2018-04-29 16:04:23 Agreed. But when we say "sex isn't a need" instead of pointing out sex and women aren't commodities, we set ourselves up for later problems when we advocate for sexual freedom and identity.
83 2018-04-29 15:55:10 Ok, well I've had a look and they seem to boil down to "quietly remind incels that terrorism is an option" or "pay incels compensation for lack of sex". In both cases I don't see how you're distinguishing sex from other commodities any more than the incels are.
84 2018-04-29 15:54:02 Buy commodities, sell brands has long been a formula for business success. That’s why it is better to invest in Apple
85 2018-04-29 15:51:30 My taxes have gone up under trump.  Price of gas has gone up under trump.  Price of commodities has gone up under trump.  Everything costs more and I’m making less.  Sounds like trump is screwing us
86 2018-04-29 15:51:29 When you will reduce price of petrol diesel and essential commodities.  As promised before.  NOW again new assurance.
87 2018-04-29 15:49:57 We will be proud when price of petrol diesel and essential commodities will be decreased. Don't make the fool to poor Indians with these emotional games.
88 2018-04-29 15:47:50 What about price touching to sky of petrol diesel and essential commodities. Electrified ho ne se pait Ki aag nahin bujhti hai madam.
89 2018-04-29 15:46:17 Listener is foolish, emotional and innocent .He should ask with you regarding price touching to sky of petrol diesel and essential commodities.
90 2018-04-29 15:42:30 Cuando revisas la caída estrepitosa del precio del petróleo en 2014, al mismo tiempo el desbalance de nuestra economía, sin embargo, los Commodities son todavía indispensables para la Sanidad de nuestras finanzas públicas. Pero nos toca empezar a hacer la transición.
91 2018-04-29 15:29:05 Let’s just realize the fact that we are commodities and whoever loses us should be devastated
92 2018-04-29 15:29:02 Nothing bearish about commodities, sure they are volatile but stay long and buy the dips until CBs decide to fight the inflation
93 2018-04-29 15:21:02 Capitalism thrives on your addiction, it thrives on your weakness in the face of its tantalizing, poisonous, commodities.
94 2018-04-29 15:02:39 When liquidity tightens, which it is. Only question is who is going get hurt badly. Question is a)stocks b)bonds c)EM d)commodities. I suspect it is all, but who gets hurt the most. That is what we will find out.
95 2018-04-29 15:02:15 Rare commodities are worth more than good
96 2018-04-29 15:00:18 Situations change so rapidly in the NFL. Last year Mack & Drake both landed in fairly deep backfields, but today both are hot commodities. I don't stress over landing spots especially w/RBs.
97 2018-04-29 14:57:38 Yes. Female bodies as commodities. These shifts in language are deliberate and should be challenged and resisted at every turn.
98 2018-04-29 14:52:16 So what are we doing to correct it? Why is it so much to ask that we don't treat cultures and people like commodities when they're still being oppressed? Why is being thoughtful such a hard thing for you?
99 2018-04-29 14:49:38 You’re right with Trump it’s all about what you can do for him. He discards people like they’re commodities and then pretends like he barely knew them!  Let’s see how long it takes for him to turn on Macron. (Who in my opinion, was just being gracious!)
100 2018-04-29 14:37:08 @AnnaAnnasvahn har nämn Lyxor Commodities EX-Energy. Finns även exempelvis ETFS Softs (Kaffe, socker, bomull) och ETFS All Commodities, som jag kikar på via Nordnet. Tankar om dom?
101 2018-04-29 14:31:41 Do you not own a laptop?
Or have you figured out how to exchange electronics for other commodities in Balmer’s gift economy?
102 2018-04-29 14:25:18 Nations have realised that to mitigate US sanctions, they must de-dollarise. Then you have the pivot towards pricing commodities in non-USD. So this time, there are reasons to expect a more gradual tilt. But I’m sure a massive catastrophe might catalyse it though, no doubt
103 2018-04-29 14:22:52 Inflation is ticking up: wages are growing, commodities are rallying, tariffs, velocity of m2 starting to rise. Careful looking to the past decade and assuming the next decade will be a repeat. Things change. My $0.02
104 2018-04-29 14:16:32 El estado empezó a crecer en tiempos de Alan García 2 de manera considerable. Su gobierno también se vio favorecido x los precios de los commodities. Se debió ser más riguroso con esos ingresos y no gastarlos en ministerios nuevos x ejemplo...

108 2018-04-29 13:47:33 why major currencies and commodities should collapse against usd?!!
wait for our charts for tonight !
109 2018-04-29 13:40:46 I'm sure we know its not for recreational use but you can't avoid side marketing of these high value commodities
110 2018-04-29 13:38:10 Sadly civility, decorum and manners are rare commodities anymore.
111 2018-04-29 13:34:17 You are obviously ignorant about how economics works. Airline seats are perishable commodities - you get them cheap by booking in advance. You can always buy a full fare ticket which is cancellable in a full service airline. Regulation will lead to higher costs for all
112 2018-04-29 13:33:22 They are both commodities subject to availability and price, but you don’t need a background check to get mental health care, and no one is trying to restrict your right to seek it either.
113 2018-04-29 13:31:29 They are both commodities in a (relatively) free market. You have to pay for both, you have access to both in that you have to pay for them, and no one is trying to restrict your right to seek medical care.
114 2018-04-29 13:28:03 @kanyewest PLEASE start up Yeezycoin specifically as a marketplace to swap commodities and other coins for Yeezies ($YEEZ) which can be used SPECIFICALLY to purchase custom Yeezys!!! #TokenizeTheWorld #BTC #ETH #crypto #BCH
115 2018-04-29 13:18:29 He writes in these pretty turns of phrase... about his belief women are commodities to be shunted around and put to use. It's grotesque.
116 2018-04-29 13:13:49 Their spending all over the world has the upliftment of the people as driver.

They are securing strategic commodities and laying the groundwork for more hegemony.

As far as they’re concerned, an investment for their people.
117 2018-04-29 13:12:05 A conversation with a nervous investor:
Investor:
There’s always precious metals, commodities, cryptocurrencies, or real estate, right?
Me:
Definitely, except you need to be knowledgeable in these areas. They can be extremely speculative. How much risk can you take?
118 2018-04-29 13:11:48 Trust is the foundation of every relationship. Trust &  are the 2 most valuable commodities u can give 2 another human.   u can nvr get back. Trust, if betrayed, is hard 2 give again & yet fosters FORGIVENESS . I recall someone being nailed on a cross to show the world this.
119 2018-04-29 13:09:58 Los humanos usados como commodities, ¿no?  Cuando las AFP pierden...
120 2018-04-29 13:06:37 An astute comment about  history all over the world being attributable to the selfless acts of horses who had no choice but to serve under the soldiers who rode them! 

Time to educate and remind this generation so that they stop seeing horses as commodities.
121 2018-04-29 13:04:44 Sadly, they view you and others as replaceable commodities. Keep proving them WRONG. We see. Now you do too.
122 2018-04-29 13:00:11 Hey Matthew I would like to ask if you are still working on Dec Exchange for commodities and other on the top of Ambrosus? I saw your post back in Nov, can you give some updates?
123 2018-04-29 12:58:50 keep trying to change the culture, work towards a world where women are not considered commodities.
124 2018-04-29 12:57:10 A3 At HS level cell phones and videogames are the hot commodities. Combining learning with technology is what I do. Use @GetKahoot and @quizlet to practice concepts. Also use board games like Scrabble. #HackLearning
125 2018-04-29 12:49:24 This whole thing is a complete mess.

Understanding some things should never be commodities is beyond that asshole.

Informed consent is fundamental to a civilized society.

"Othering" powerless internet virgins for being ignorant is also bad.

They are victims of Patriarchy too.
126 2018-04-29 12:45:46 Woman are not commodities!!
127 2018-04-29 12:35:20 what the actual - women are not commodities to be distributed. we’re not surplus fucking cheese.

129 2018-04-29 11:35:13 Disturbing report on Sky News about increasing fashion for animals used at wedding ceremonies in UK.  Frivolous, ungodly attitude to ceremony & animals used as entertainment commodities in stressful environment.

Let me ask u then... How direct or indirect did the ban by Mike Bimha result in the price increase we have today in zim? How did the artificial shortage of basic commodities trigger e price rise after e govt ban?
131 2018-04-29 11:20:59 Great interview @blairenns And I agree, "Self-esteem" is a common issue. I think clients view financial professionals as commodities because that's what how the professionals feel about themselves. #NoOneCanDoYou #OwnIt #SellYou #KillTheBillableHour #GetPaid #LI
132 2018-04-29 11:13:34 Normalmente crash de bolsa contamina tudo. Menos o título do tesouro americano que sobe de preço (cai o yield) numa corrida para proteção. O dólar nesse momento, reserva financeira global, tende a se valorizar frente às outras moedas. Commodities desabam tbem.
133 2018-04-29 11:04:55 In the end they're just commodities to be bought and sold I suppose. Any restriction would probably negatively affect the restoration business.

135 2018-04-29 10:48:30 #ARV slow and steady with their great projects in WA. As the commodities cycle to feed Asian growth really kicks into gear, I can see this stock being a multi-mine, multi-commodity powerhouse for Australia. Led by their high grade gold, in a much higher gold price environment.
136 2018-04-29 10:39:54 Yes but did you know where this cash was coming from. Hawala unaccounted money flowed into purchase of agri commodities from the farmer and there was no tax paid by these traders. Why? It's was all black money.

138 2018-04-29 09:48:45 I eat meat and im perfectly healthy. Do you honestly think veganism will actually ever stop anything? That’s a serious question. And to many people they are commodities, I for one don’t care in the slightest if an animal is killed.
139 2018-04-29 09:47:44 I will say e govt is to blame. They banned imports of basic commodities. Prices soured. Naturally if salaries can buy enuf pple strike. I guess e govt its pushin e political tag bt truely there is need to adress than fire... It can work now bt not longer
140 2018-04-29 09:37:13 why are you comparing these 2 black ladies as commodities who can be bought or sold
141 2018-04-29 09:14:41 Digital Gold is close but not accurate BTC is an intangible asset - non contractual so not a financial asset - a decentralised tool for bartering in exchange for goods, commodities, services or fiat currencies - its value is due to consensus - My opinion
142 2018-04-29 09:02:13 Supply and demand works for commodities like pork bellies and orange juice not people.

149 2018-04-29 08:30:02 Capitalism is the private ownership over the means to production, wage labour and the production and selling of commodities through a market. Private ownership was eradicate and do was most of the markets. The state however became state capitalist because it became isolated.
150 2018-04-29 08:28:13 Excellent news for women and girls in Victoria. Prostitution hurts all women and girls because it is based on the notion that female bodies are commodities.
151 2018-04-29 08:26:16 arbitrarge is the simultaneous buying and selling of securities, currency, or commodities in different markets or in derivative forms in order to take advantage of differing prices for the same asset.
152 2018-04-29 08:19:23 The price of essential commodities is not at all high. As for petrol ,who is against it coming under GST? Don't have to eat data save & eat whatever you want to.

166 2018-04-29 04:54:49 I’m glad you make this point. The main obstacle before us is dismantling the dependence upon things we cannot replace, much of this is done on a small scale by communities creating independent economies around necessary commodities. More about survival than Flintstones Gummies
167 2018-04-29 04:53:57 Fuck people who have petty demands of a friendship without any intention of reciprocating or committing in any way. Friends are not commodities to tickle your own ego solely for your benefit.
168 2018-04-29 04:49:50 We kanadigaaa are clever then u telling jumlaas of bharatiya jumlaa party first u tell PM to reduce fuel price and create jobs for youths. If PM didn't reduce commodities price and then what is the use of building toilets without food
169 2018-04-29 04:32:52 You are right. But it's not the farmer who's saying this but the middlemen who dealt in huge cash to hoard farm produce such as tur Dal, Onion. Have you seen the price of these commodities going exorbitant ever since demo ? Farmer still gets the same old price !
170 2018-04-29 04:28:41 I don’t think he’s actually calling for such redistribution. He’s using the lack of a call for such redistribution to invalidate calls for wealth redistribution while simultaneously viewing sex (and women’s bodies) as nothing but commodities.

174 2018-04-29 03:34:13 The G'vt should just hand it out with our commodities when the do away with SNAP benefits.
175 2018-04-29 03:32:44 But how will we know your reports are valuable if they aren't included as commodities for the private profits of journal company shareholders? Why would the masses of sleep-deprived grad students waste time citing anything without "Nature" in the name?  #BrandIdentity
176 2018-04-29 03:28:09 Honestly I don't care if someone sees me as a sex object because i am confident in my ability to castrate them with one hand tied behind my back but any implication that my fiancee or any of my friends are just commodities and I WILL END YOU
177 2018-04-29 03:04:35 Pulse of public: LPG price, Petrol price and prices of essential commodities.

Don’t understand why opposition parties can’t take up these issues as BJP when they were in opposition.
178 2018-04-29 03:02:36 Why don’t all these men complaining about not having sex just have sex with one another and stop talking about women as commodities and objects? 
179 2018-04-29 02:35:34 Uhh, yeah. Not like these are unknown commodities. There’s like 1 million people in this movie - how much character development do we need NYT?
180 2018-04-29 02:26:14 You mean...a commodity like water? Like food? Those are just commodities. Shelter is a commodity. Your argument is bullshit.
181 2018-04-29 02:20:00 There's nothing revolutionary about doing drugs, they make you addicted to capitalist commodities.
182 2018-04-29 02:04:25 Very nice paper. I hadn't seen your 2015 AJAE with Garcia and Smith, but it has a completely sensible conclusion. Any likelihood we'll see a grain storage contact like was introduced for MARS oil? (Once had a student propose such a contact in my commodities class.)

184 2018-04-29 01:58:22 Tampoco, Tampoco, Del 2006 al 2011 no se hizo nada, ninguna reforma del Estado que explique la bonanza económica, fue más de lo mismo, usufructuaron de la subida de los precios de los commodities que fue suerte no mérito.
185 2018-04-29 01:55:04 High unlikely that this happen, since this would mean a barter economy in modern times.

How would one be able to pay for a hot dog using a Amazon share?

Cash is just a commodity used to evaluate all other commodities. It is one of the main reasons why it was invented
186 2018-04-29 01:48:44 Without even getting into the specifics of the plan or its feasibility, the premise is that women's bodies are commodities.  

Full Stop.
187 2018-04-29 01:37:53 EVEN if this were true (but again: zero data), this only shows correlation, not causation. It’s likely true that healthy, non-exploitative sex is part of human flourishing, BUT that occurs in relationships with people you treat like people and not commodities.
188 2018-04-29 01:34:55 I have 2 years experience working in a university library, 2 years working in a public library, and 1 year in a corporate commodities law library in downtown Chicago(athough they had no card catalog there). Yes, I know what it is!
189 2018-04-29 01:33:41 As look back at history of “cash crops” (defined as those legally grown commodities that make enough $ to grow all else), will this be 21st Century’s tobacco? 
If so, will it’s fate be similar?
190 2018-04-29 01:22:18 Rail should be used to haul commodities and people that's why railways were constructed. Oil should be shipped by pipelines. That's why they are constructed. And self serving politicians that argue against a pipeline....well they are just self serving politicians.
191 2018-04-29 01:10:38 Agreed.  People forget they are human beings, and start treating them like commodities or products.  Makes my blood boil.  #TheGoldenRuleIsAlwaysCool

194 2018-04-29 00:54:43 Lobbying .. to get dudes laid? SRSLY? Ppl, specifically women, aren't commodities to consider distributing, let alone 'redistributing' .. TF out of here w/this Handmaid's Tale B.S.
195 2018-04-29 00:33:45 This is so revolting I can’t even handle it. Women are commodities to be used up by men according to these fuckers. Value derived solely through how we serve men and are judged by them. Gtfoh
196 2018-04-29 00:22:42 The simple phrase “redistribution of Sex” is a fallacy bc it eliminates all consent and agency on the part of women, assumes them to be draftable commodities into your comfort woman force and acts like sex is a commodity that the woman having the sex doesn’t control.
197 2018-04-29 00:19:18 You really don't get it do you ? You can not redistribute women,we are not products,we are not commodities,we are not yours .
198 2018-04-29 00:18:49 If draft rules changed to only allow receivers to be chosen, Lazard still wouldn’t have been a first round draft pick. ISU's 45 yr record of futility would remain intact. It's impossible to say what round he would've went with so many unknown commodities from other continents.

238 2018-04-28 21:12:51 Youre right It's weird how all these socialists believe in sharing commodities but not women. It's almost like they don't see that women are a commodity
239 2018-04-28 21:12:44 Notice Emmer putting boundaries on SEC enforcement? You’re welcome. I’m the altcoin lobby. We don’t make a securities. We make commodities.
240 2018-04-28 21:05:57 I can't even find an entry point into this debate because one of the givens is that women's bodies are commodities.
241 2018-04-28 21:04:22 Otro gráfico interesante @ProBu2010 . Siempre coherente a tus recomendaciones. Se vienen épocas interesantes para commodities.
242 2018-04-28 20:58:34 i was so poor i qualified for government commodities. i had a great social worker. she got me signed up for that & the budget plan w/the gas company. i paid all year long even when i wasn't using the heat.
243 2018-04-28 20:53:58 That's nothing compared to priviledges that tax payer/s will be given back through cheap resources and lot of other commodities.
244 2018-04-28 20:48:18 How’s this for a hot take. Women are NOT commodities or property whose sexual access should be discussed or argued over by anyone other then the woman in question alone. And if it’s an arguement the answer is NO, fuck off.
245 2018-04-28 20:48:09 My understanding is the so called silos, ie, Ag clearinghouses - call the shots. Farmers deliver Ag commodities to silos, & Silo Operators & Commodity Traders set the price based on Futures. Imagine beef, poultry & dairy is handled in similar fashion. A scam like everthing else.
246 2018-04-28 20:43:19 A way to reduce sex inequality is to build equality between the sexes in general. A world where men look at women as friends as opposed to commodities would be a good start. But thats not the kind of equality you’re referencing.
247 2018-04-28 20:21:17 Never bet against the ingenuity of a commodities broker?
248 2018-04-28 20:06:55 Time and courage. Two very rare commodities in our short lives. Embrace both.
249 2018-04-28 20:05:02 3209: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
250 2018-04-28 20:04:27 There was an unnatural demarcation b/w #socialist #NorthKorea n #Capitalist #SouthKorea, nations can progress when freedom to movement prevail for humans bt in capitalism only commodities n capitalist can easily move,restrictions are for #workingclass,failed system, shame
251 2018-04-28 20:02:59 Please talk on price rise of petrol , diesel and all essential commodities. And how a middle and lower middle class surviving ??
252 2018-04-28 20:02:06 Jajajaaja decíselo a los precios de los commodities: soja, trigo; carnes; combustibles, etc. Cuando se vuelquen a precio y disparen la inflación, me contás. Sorete.
253 2018-04-28 19:51:03 @SEC_Enforcement @FINRA The same way we Regulate commodities & the Spot Market.
254 2018-04-28 19:38:32 Why aren't import tariffs impossed Ag commodities & products -- so US farmers, dairymen, growers, & ranchers are able to increase their sales to domestic consumers?
255 2018-04-28 19:28:03 We are not commodities to be bargained with or exploited or used to promote an agenda or boost quotas!
256 2018-04-28 19:26:36 Liberal extremists  wasting energy on anti-Trump propaganda, & Trump doesn't  give a damn of what's written about him &, in an era in where false news & cheap gossip are valuable  commodities, only the dimwits among the masses still believe in everything peddled by the media
257 2018-04-28 19:23:50 We are not commodities to be bargained with or exploited or used to promote an agenda or boost quotas!!
258 2018-04-28 19:22:46 Sorry but it is not in the best interest of the child for them to be handed over to people for alleged treatment whom the NHS has proved cannot help. 

This story is also being hijacked by some very sick & greedy people from the US who want to force patients to be commodities.
259 2018-04-28 19:20:26 We are not commodities to be bargained with or exploited or used to promote an agenda or boost quotas.
260 2018-04-28 19:19:13 I've actually been thinking that they might be loading up on 2019 picks to use as currency for in season trades, filling their holes with proven commodities.
261 2018-04-28 19:14:34 That has nothing to do with how I sleep. You act like you treat women like garbage, like commodities
262 2018-04-28 19:13:19 $HG_F The Instrument have reached the 50% of declined from peak at 2011, which is the peak among all commodities.#elliottwave
263 2018-04-28 19:12:54 What always kind of blows my mind is that they are essentially demanding for sexual slavery, yet haven't considered that women don't want to have sex with them because they are assholes. I mean, given that "Chad" doesn't endorse treating women as commodities, he sounds nicer.
264 2018-04-28 19:07:44 Cowboys flipped their fifth-round pick for Jamize Olawale and the pick that they just flipped for Tavon Austin.

Turning a fifth-round pick into two legitimate veteran commodities in the backfield is good work, even if you’re not thrilled about either individual player.
265 2018-04-28 19:04:51 What right do we have as humans to think that we can use other species on this world as commodities to do with as we wish? They have as much right as us to be here and their rights are to be respected.
266 2018-04-28 19:04:21 That said, I KNOW NOT bowing ISN’T possible for MOST! And something mentioned in the book as the #1 reason administrators EXPLOIT healthcare workers as pawns & DISCARD us as COMMODITIES!(5)
267 2018-04-28 18:57:05 Folks seem to want community the way we want commodities: on-call and on our own time.
268 2018-04-28 18:47:06 16 Candles. Girls are commodities that boys trade, the hero trades his drunken girlfriend for the female lead's underwear which she had given to another boy so he could have bragging rights to her. Also makes fun of Asians, girl in a back brace.
269 2018-04-28 18:45:30 yup. commuting congestion & gymn time = expensive in many ways. poor use of scarce commodities
270 2018-04-28 18:41:47 Jimmy Carter: “Normalizing the act of buying sex also debases men by assuming that they are entitled to access women’s bodies for sexual gratification. If paying for sex is normalized, then every young boy will learn that women and girls are commodities to be bought and sold."
271 2018-04-28 18:39:24 Nice read..”CAC is the new rent”. Seems pretty obvious focusing on value vs. experience is a recipe for burn and crash. Same with non networked commodities.
272 2018-04-28 18:35:41 Things that get distributed are called commodities. The fact that you think that this is somehow how women should be viewed makes me sick. When you don’t view women as people they want nothing to do with you.
273 2018-04-28 18:20:48 The problem does not lie with our healthcare system. The NHS has saved the lives of the working class, and therefore the industry and economy of our country. The problem is this hidden clause in our birth certificate that makes us commodities and property of the crown.
274 2018-04-28 18:16:43 commodities
275 2018-04-28 18:14:32 Commodities take years upon years to move. Over Supply doesn’t become deficit over several years.  Look at the 60s and 70s. Took nearly 20 years.
276 2018-04-28 18:10:32 Women are not commodities. And relationships with them aren't transactional.
277 2018-04-28 18:00:55 Your tweet isn't helping your cause. Women aren't commodities and the fact you think they are reduced you to the 'never getting laid' category.

Nothing to do with your looks, this is all personality, which you can change, if you wanted to.

Enjoy being alone forever.
278 2018-04-28 17:59:23 That seems too long. HW wallets should be commodities already. The tech is about as complicated as a pocket calculator. Price should be $10 not $100.
279 2018-04-28 17:55:44 "The organization must create an environment that is open to the right kind of surprises and welcome them. They provide one of the most valuable commodities possible: new information." ~ @jimhazy #leadership #complexity
280 2018-04-28 17:51:43 China will not lose are you high... Everything we own is made in China... The American people will lose because our good and commodities will go up... Everyone who shops at Wal-Mart and basically everywhere else prepare to pay more... China is in the driver's seat..
281 2018-04-28 17:48:47 The all-time lowest unemployment rate in Montana occurred under Jimmy Carter, whereas its all-time highest unemployment rate occurred in Reagan's 2nd term. That's because gold price & commodities price crashes under Reagan from double digit 1980 inflation.
282 2018-04-28 17:46:52 I mean at a macro level like The Chicago commodities exchange.
283 2018-04-28 17:43:03 in 2012,his opponent ran as a "Reagan Republican", but Montana's all-time high unemployment rate was in Reagan's SECOND term, from crash of gold & commodities as inflation kept falling. Next guy needs to be shrewd & smart...& know his politics to beat getting fatter cat Tester.
284 2018-04-28 17:39:56 @AndrewYangVFA universal income is the worst possible idea ever... it woyld literally turn 12k into nothing... if everybody has the same amount of money, tgat amount becomes worthless and basic commodities prices sky rocket
285 2018-04-28 17:37:40 I think you're missing the point. Even your nudge ideas imply that women are commodities.
286 2018-04-28 17:37:26 Of course the West is powerful. It’s innovation, progress and development provides nitwits with commodities and life the rest of the world couldn’t imagine let alone achieve. You’re here on this thread because of that achievement #idiot
287 2018-04-28 17:34:36 Inequality of what? Redistribution of what? The only way one can answer this is to assume (at least on some level) that women are commodities.
288 2018-04-28 17:32:37 CEOs must answer to shareholders...capitalists in our capitalist system. They only deal in prices, not freedom or peace, the priceless commodities.
289 2018-04-28 17:26:21 Thanks for clarifying! I think that your articulation about women and sex not being commodities aptly relates to prostitution, so even though that wasn't your original intent, I thought it was very well stated.
290 2018-04-28 17:18:45 The one thing that I have noticed in 2018 is that inter-market relationships have completely broken down. Rate differentials stopped driving FX. FX stopped driving gold/commodities. Real rates stopped driving gold. Risk parity has a problem etc.
291 2018-04-28 17:10:01 This makes me want to throw up. Women as commodities, not as actual people.
292 2018-04-28 17:00:55 The commodities are in the differences.
293 2018-04-28 16:58:10 The Broncos are killing the draft this year. Getting players with production and known commodities. I am not the biggest Courtland Sutton fan, but Jewell and Hamilton in the fourth round are great pickups.
294 2018-04-28 16:48:13  Where to even start? Food & water are tradeable commodities; sex is only one in edge cases. Food & water are necessary for survival; sex is not. In evolutionary terms, getting enough food & water is selected for; sex is the means of selection. And that's the easy ones.
295 2018-04-28 16:46:15 More than one position, more than one month, and more than one commodity. I suppose a similar question could be asked of you. Do you hedge your own commodities, or just pop in and out of positions at will? Judging people is easy when you know nothing about them.
296 2018-04-28 16:44:57 Sir Book to understand commodities 
297 2018-04-28 16:43:52 yyy pero era un contexto extraordinario (fuera de lo común): commodities y expos volando, estábamos en default, jubilaciones congeladas, devaluación q si comparamos con la actualidad sería de más de $35 por dólar... la bomba había explotado y tenían todo para mejorar
298 2018-04-28 16:40:45 No fan has the right to stand up, lean forward and shout at a player. Your money doesn’t buy that right.  Players are not commodities.  If you  confront another person, you need to be ready for the consequence.
299 2018-04-28 16:35:58 2/2 If a business doesn't have pricing power, or can't cut cost elsewhere to retain margin, it will reduce the use of that input, whether it's labor, services or commodities products.
300 2018-04-28 16:34:13 Out with the old, in with nothing cause I have don't have the money, nor time, for such commodities. 
301 2018-04-28 16:28:15 Throw in commodities and realty too...nowhere to hide and nowhere to go....
302 2018-04-28 16:21:57 @john_keim Pick up the red phone and tell Bruce to pick up Josh Sweat.  Pass rushers are the rarest of commodities in this particular game.  If he slips...
303 2018-04-28 16:14:00 big ass bag of cash, fully out of stocks and commodities now, buying proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies
304 2018-04-28 16:07:48 So the vegan philosophy should view high-welfare dog meat production as less unethical than simply keeping a dog in your house, taking them for walks, etc? That seems implausible. Veganism has beef with turning cows into commodities and production units who can be selectively
305 2018-04-28 16:05:02 3235: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
306 2018-04-28 15:33:34 no es solo para los pequeños. El mes pasado el argentino Gonzalo Ramírez, CEO mundial de Dreyfus, hizo la primera gran operación de commodities por Blockchain. Enorme ahorro en un negocio que mueve millones y deja centavos...
307 2018-04-28 15:33:29 Logic and common sense seem to have become rare commodities
308 2018-04-28 15:32:16 Well, now we can see where his unreasonable opinion came from.  He’s trying to redefine sex as an economic commodity, ignoring the personal aspects.  Commodities can be bought, sold, traded and “redistributed”, as he mentions. It’s a soulless view sex and relationships
309 2018-04-28 15:20:28 Need farm bill that SUPPORTS #ORGANIC SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE, NOT BIOFUELS/JUNK AGRICULTURE! Stop allocating 5% of multi billion dollar budget FOR COMMODITIES! DUMPING GROUND/SUPPORTS LOW QUALITY/FACTORY FARMED MEAT/PESTICIDE LADEN CRAP FOOD TO FEED KIDS in school. Use 4 organic
310 2018-04-28 15:13:57 Sex is a commodity that can be bought and sold, but people are not (should not be) commodities. The incel crowd has not figured out that because no one loves them, they can buy sex instead of killing people. They're dangerous men.
311 2018-04-28 15:08:24 This is just one point on a wide spectrum of attitudes and behavior (Cosby, Weinstein, et al are another point) that shows how men need to still learn the basic lesson that women are human beings and NOT mere commodities that men are simply entitled to.
312 2018-04-28 15:07:48 The wider narrative of talking about migrants as commodities is so harmful. What a heartbreaking film.
313 2018-04-28 15:06:04 ..bullish $ denominated commodities long wrong as im long run bearish the dollar and think we'll get a lot of $ collapse driven inflation pushing up $ priced commodity assets like oil
314 2018-04-28 15:03:31 If the GOP doesn't care about human beings why would they care about the environment ... both are just commodities to be monetized.
315 2018-04-28 15:02:14 Rare commodities are worth more than good
316 2018-04-28 15:00:00 They don’t even consider that there’s a person involved that’s not them.

Can you draft a tennis partner?

A pickup basketball game?

Women are commodities to some people, not partners or teammates. We are the  or the court, not a player.
317 2018-04-28 14:55:27 As usual, it also praises the 'market' while completely failing to understand how markets work. Commodities can be 'price bibled', but one would hope that human relationships aren't as worthless as a barrel of oil.
318 2018-04-28 14:53:48 The people of #Ghana should be proud to be a part of this historic agreement. The #AfCFTA will finally change the way the world sees #Africa, and change the perceived value of its #commodities, that developed countries have for so long depended on for their own success.
319 2018-04-28 14:44:53 Yes.Not sure what they do in the very near-term but commodities will be hit hard in the coming bust. Oil to $10 & copper to $1 are my targets. Near-term we'll have to see how they react to the the final move down in USD to 85-86. Junk spreads will likely rise to 2000 BP or higher
320 2018-04-28 14:43:07 It would be good to find a way to reduce currency volatility, especially overvaluation when commodities are in demand, that doesn’t rely on interest rates. Just saying. Not that a sovereign wealth fund makes sense.
321 2018-04-28 14:37:15 Russ is 100% right about fans (not just in utah) being disrespectful to players... 

It's like people buy a ticket and start treating these players like commodities.....

324 2018-04-28 14:27:33 Michigan is heart of Americas industrial revolution.Shipping lanes from the Great lakes provide massive income to the Northern U.S. and upper Mississippi and Missouri river states.That in turn provides massive buying commodities to the entire Northern U.S. and Parts of Canada.
325 2018-04-28 14:27:23 “Sexual Marketplace?”  Dudes, there’s no such thing as a hot virgin department store.  You wanna get laid?  Your first step to achieving that goal is to recognize that women are human beings, not commodities.
326 2018-04-28 14:07:07 Sir, tourist place is always beautiful and worth seeing. But I only request sir that at our home pl looted in to the common man issues. Pl control price of essential commodities and petroleum product. Pl provide employment to unemployed youths. Pl provide better education
327 2018-04-28 13:58:08 Yahoo (cyber fraud) is our way of getting reparations from 400 years of slavery, 75 years of colonization and the never ending racism. Sometimes I pity the scammed white people but then I remember this people treated us like commodities.
328 2018-04-28 13:56:19 Capitalism ruins everything! It turns art into commodities, and artists into brands. I love what you're doing though! Keep grinding! You got a lot of people cheering for you.
329 2018-04-28 13:52:27 Speak for yourself. "Jobs" aren't commodities that are interchangeable between old and young at the whim of a calendar; cripes. Pensioners have earned the right to retire, if they so choose to. Many do not want to, for reasons that are none of anybody else's business.
330 2018-04-28 13:47:11 Of course.  This is what I said in multiple recent podcasts: They are arbitraging the fact that USD supplies must grow by $100T+ in coming yrs while commodities supplies...won’t.  “You take the USD’s, we’ll take the real assets”, as noted above.
331 2018-04-28 13:42:34 Yes it is but most companies treat their workers like commodities too.  It's the same business principles and whilst I know pregnancy is not an injury it can have similar effects on a business.  Notice and being paid back help but doesn't negate the true cost of hiring cover.
332 2018-04-28 13:42:24 I call that Tuesday! Unfortunately, the airline industry is (with a few exceptions) a commodities business (fuel, labor, operations overhead, etc) more than one rooted in customer service; an economic trade-off for grandma’s, 6-month advance purchase, $239 Thanksgiving flight.
333 2018-04-28 13:39:26 Not surprising...it’s hard to bill yourself as the east coast’s premiere festival when you already have bigger known commodities in Firefly and Giv Ball in the area.
334 2018-04-28 13:34:33 So I should be charging for my man honey? Is it on the commodities market?
335 2018-04-28 13:30:32 Trying to wrap my head around what he’s saying in that thread, but I’m just struggling so hard. Like... that’s not how this works in any decent kind of way. Women are not supposed to be commodities (despite the very real world we live in). 

Policy to give men access to sex???
336 2018-04-28 13:29:52 Football is a whole different world - where people are treated as commodities. Pregnancy isn’t an injury and usually comes with at least 9 months notice  Women and men are entitled by law to parental leave so it shouldn’t be an issue on either side.
337 2018-04-28 13:19:21 We don't have money to eat food and commodities prices are high but making toilets what is the use

340 2018-04-28 12:59:44 There are no commodities, but good and bad executed products. From my point of view, Drive vs Dropbox is definitely an example.
341 2018-04-28 12:59:26 It's a shame how someone can treat people like disposable commodities........
342 2018-04-28 12:40:34 Or 2013, bonds down & stocks up.  Late cycle commodities boom!
343 2018-04-28 12:39:21 I guess yes, but what has destroyed normal human behavior and socialization skills ha sheen the rise of technology specially smartphones. So yes a combination the mentality ppl are commodities not beings that need love, even tho everyone complains, they all do it.

351 2018-04-28 12:00:04 #Gold and #silver, like other #commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity.
352 2018-04-28 11:46:23 Forget about that. The likes of Sharad Pawar will surely stir up the prices of essential commodities. Remember how onions and other veggies went up during Vajpayee.
353 2018-04-28 11:45:36 Geologists or mining engineers can apply geostatistics at all stages of the mine life cycle: from exploration to development, production and even for site remediation. Geostatistics offers a wide range of methodologies adapted to all commodities and styles of deposits.
354 2018-04-28 11:45:21 For a blockchain to work, the asset it secures/transfers/etc. *has to* be native to that blockchain (i.e. like bitcoin). If you're just linking real-world commodities to a token, that's not necessarily bad, but a blockchain would not be a useful/sensible part of such a scheme.
355 2018-04-28 11:36:35 Want to stop the war in Yemen? Pressure Washington, not Riyadh. Wars lower the prices of commodities. Lower prices for commodities creates slave labor profiteering for the world's financial capitals (New York City&London). #endWarinYemen #genocidedenial #War4StockMarket #NYSE
356 2018-04-28 11:02:59 Military build up, maximum sanctions, convincing China to reduce important commodities to them, a starving country... I think that would warrant a change in mind. Even if they think they've achieved a nuclear milestone, it won't matter if you're blown to smithereens...
357 2018-04-28 10:44:20 And the process in the UK is very different to the US. The US system strikes me as almost commercialised, where adopted children are commodities, which makes me very uncomfortable.

366 2018-04-28 08:18:41 Oh man you’ve just told me the most hilarious joke in this century. Pop quiz! Count how many commodities in your home that is made in China. Too hard? Try this one: count how many commodities in your home that is NOT made in China. Should be easier, huh?
367 2018-04-28 08:04:53 Oh si! Ci sono rimasti segmenti di nicchia. Le commodities (che soni quelle che fanno i numeri) non le abbiamo più. Quando vuoi ti ospito e ti porto a fare un giro nei summenzionati Paesi e ti mostro cosa significa PAESE INDUSTRIALIZZATO.

Information = knowledge as product

But attention? Not sure.

369 2018-04-28 07:38:52 Y es de mala fe sostener q Duhalde y Lavagna nos sacaron del incendió. Ellos lo causaron, rompieron todos los contratos y se apalancaron en la infraestructura de los 90, los dólares ahorrados y luego el aumento de las commodities.

371 2018-04-28 07:24:25 Is there any fund in @KotakMF that invests in precious metals besides kotak gold (already bought) and that gives us exposure to other commodities (especially silver)? Time horizon 2 years.
372 2018-04-28 07:14:32 @SiddharthaTopse 
Sir, for a beginner, is trading in forex safer than commodities? Which one of the two has a higher correlation with equity markets?
373 2018-04-28 07:07:38 Brilliant move to help the truly needy. This would really help the small vendor who often trades in essential commodities on a daily basis
374 2018-04-28 06:58:42 Dogs now have dedicated swimming pools in Melbourne for when owners are too busy to walk them. Other 4 legged animals die in their thousands of thirst and other depravities from Live Export. All animals can be eaten. The convenient & horrific divide between pets and commodities.
375 2018-04-28 06:52:20 Aaawwwwww.. being such a crybaby.
Just do me a favor n clarify what d problem is, not being able to keep busy all day, grabbing? Order fact that d commodities to be grabbed ain't available? 

I'd wait..

378 2018-04-28 06:19:24 Exactly!  Like this entire thread is bc of a comment on shampoo. The shampoo is actually apart of a much bigger issue of the fact that most American commodities are almost exclusively for whites which is ingrained privilege and those who benefit from it don’t see it
379 2018-04-28 06:10:45 The real world functions on real commodities such as health care, pensions, even sallaries are paid to those who don't live on unicorn farts.

Ideology without real (marerialistic) solutions is delusional and creates real problems.
380 2018-04-28 05:56:43 as long as markets rule health and social care ppl will be commodities
381 2018-04-28 05:50:22 The rising prices of all commodities, including foodgrains, during the last few years, have certainly made a further dent in an already not-so happy a situation.
382 2018-04-28 05:44:46 The couple should be thanked for their gesture. If possible, the jewellery, their capital for old age be got returned to them.
Govt in any case places such essential life saving commodities for troops.

385 2018-04-28 05:31:20 If i’m paying for a service, i’m paying for the commodities, the house keeping etc. It is not beneficial on a consumers standpoint when I can’t use what’s included. If the room doesn’t come with towels, should I simply bring my own?
386 2018-04-28 05:25:52 Almost 60 % of India’s trade is in Service Sector & not commodities. We have the same manpower but unfortunately Govt has not paid any attention to develop

400 2018-04-28 03:22:10 What is the definition of a “concentrated commodities market” under law? Those words have no meaning to which one might actually respond with anything of substance.
401 2018-04-28 03:21:43 Hike is in petrol prices everyday a serious issue, central and state government should take necessary actions to reduce it. Hike in petrol and disel prices, Increases the rate of essential commodities. #PetrolPrice
402 2018-04-28 03:14:26 The thing that is semi-unique about cryptocurrencies is that they are human manufactured commodities. They are like vinyl records or baseball cards, not diamond or pig bellies.
403 2018-04-28 02:58:55 Women are not resources. Women are not commodities. Women are not the scenery amid which an unthinking universe randomizes the outcome of sexual endeavors.

WOMEN ARE PEOPLE.

OMGess what is wrong with the men willing to publicly demonstrate how thoroughly they don't get this?
404 2018-04-28 02:14:39 (1) Broadly speaking, I'm terrified by the resemblance of the contemporary art market to the form of securities fraud known as "pump and dump," wherein otherwise worthless commodities have their value inflated via hype--immediately prior to sale.
405 2018-04-28 02:12:04 I learned a lot from brad Wall in Saskatchewan who took credit for a commodities and export boom but when it collapsed conveniently reminded us that gov doesn't control exports prices. Our competitive position has not changed. Nor has the government of Saskatchewan.

407 2018-04-28 02:00:09 Really been funny to watch all these sad sacks reverse engineer a system where the disadvantaged are artificially elevated, but they couldn't figure out how to work around the part where people would have to be commodities
408 2018-04-28 01:57:10 Am I really the first negative voice on Guice?  Not b/c of legal stuff.  RBs are commodities.  We already have 3 good ones.  And we need to replace Fuller.  Another pick wasted by BA.
409 2018-04-28 01:48:21 Today facts are commodities and we have to make people care. Deliver why! #amasummit @amasummit @AMALosAngeles
410 2018-04-28 01:47:38 Where in my tweet did I say PM controls price of oil? The fact that he is in the way of getting our commodities to market is why we are selling it at a loss. He killed energy east and Trans mountain. Those actions have consequences.
411 2018-04-28 01:45:16 And after that many of the same children became traded commodities in various abuse industries.
412 2018-04-28 01:42:50 Unemployment is at historically low levels and of course commodities are cyclical. So if we blame the PM for the low price of oil do we credit him for a commodity boom that could be around the corner? Prolly not. PM does not really control the price of oil frankly.
413 2018-04-28 01:37:08 @MSNBC Fine and a new commodity was know available on the Chicago's Commodities Market and the people selling it were the only ones that owned any carbon you could buy all Obama's money men I wonder how much they had to invest to corner the market so instead of paying a huge fine
414 2018-04-28 01:17:51 Redistribution of sex? Not nearly in the same category as material wealth. Humans are not commodities.
415 2018-04-28 01:02:26 ME: it's not about men's access to sex  
THE INTERNET: it's funny though because i bet he doesn't have a lot of it  
ME (throws chair): it's about treating women's bodies as commodities
416 2018-04-28 00:45:06 40% ownership may be easy, but mining is expensive, the commodities doesn’t pop out the ground by itself. So our taxes will be used as cash flow- i.e Eskom. 
You (govt) ran most SOE’s and municipalities to the ground, good luck running mines and banks.

421 2018-04-28 00:19:39 Stating that you can “redistribute” sex is precisely the same as saying that sex, and therefore within the “incel” community specifically women’s, bodies are something that are distributed in the first place. That they are objects, goods, commodities. They aren’t.

These hotels have to know about an issue to solve it first.

In my opinion: Usually the commodities will best suit the 'preference' of the people making the decisions.
460 2018-04-27 21:49:31 Twitter's a platform to grow you own personal brand, but as a result people become less unique individuals and more caricatures of their brand -- intellectual commodities, so to speak.
461 2018-04-27 21:48:24 Durante los 90 el PBI creció muchísimo, veníamos de Alfonsín.
El crecimiento durante los K fue a causa del valor más alto en la historia mundial de los commodities, hiperdevaluar y a expensas del no pagar la deuda durante 14 años.
Amén del saqueo interior, sobre todo al campo.
462 2018-04-27 21:48:11 Truth and Trust are rare commodities, you, Theresa May, Tory Gov't and Tory Party as a whole have neither. 
Resign, all of you. 
The Country deserves better.
463 2018-04-27 21:41:26 This is the situation faced by those who operate in the multi asset space. Equity indexes have pairwise correlations close to 1, but correlations between stocks and bonds, or gold, or commodities, etc. sometimes stray into negative territory. And vols are wildly different.
464 2018-04-27 21:36:18 Little rant coming up. The problem with having health care and employment so tied up is that it creates a sort of slavery system, in which the workers are commodities and can never be free. Healthcare is a basic human right and should be treated as such.

466 2018-04-27 21:13:49 Buhari a stark illiterate,came to power 84,collapsed the country, have to force poor people in market places to reduce the price of commodities

469 2018-04-27 20:57:21 correct and will be classified as a security,real decentralized coins that can be used as currency like DGB,BTC,LTC will be commodities, and the end of ICO ERC-20 token scam companies,its pretty simple, you can't have a decentralized cryptocurrency that is controlled by a company
470 2018-04-27 20:55:18 Anything can relate to business, the NFL is a business.  The players are commodities. You’re too narrow minded.
471 2018-04-27 20:54:21 You literally think access to people's bodies and their time and affection are commodities that can be redistributed.
472 2018-04-27 20:45:33 You know, if his comments didn’t fit into the larger, historical context of seeing (and using) women/women’s bodies as commodities and/or resources, it may be easier to mistake what he says as simply uneducated illogic. But it’s dangerous and has real-world effects on women.
473 2018-04-27 20:39:45 Thorium reactors instead of uranium... cheaper, more sustainable, less waste, just as good. And let's get hydrogen out there to compete with electric and oil as fuel commodities! Keep energy and gas prices down with competition and put the oil barons in their place.
474 2018-04-27 20:37:55 A starting QB on a rookie salary can create something like a $15 million cap surplus (per year!) to redistribute throughout the rest of the roster on proven commodities. Hard to fathom some GM’s of what equate to billion dollar companies can’t grasp this.
475 2018-04-27 20:24:40 I'm about to reopen my Facebook account just to tell you how wrong this take is. Gimme your snap, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, WASTE and ig and I'll tell you how bad this take is on every platform.

Bodies are not commodities. You don't redistribute lives because your dick stay sahara.

477 2018-04-27 20:15:14 Inflation expectations troughed in June 2016. Since that time bonds returned ~ -1%, the S&P 500 ~ +33%, and commodities ~ +29%.  Just as classic economic and investment theories would predict.  Inflation expectations rising. Call #lrgwealthadvisors to get advice.

479 2018-04-27 20:12:39 You're literally using all these big words to say that "people with less access to sex" (I.e. men) should organize and lobby for greater access. Which makes no sense because women's bodies are not commodities to be accessed or acquired.

484 2018-04-27 20:01:14 Interesting how much time the market has spent in backwardation on that chart given the carrying costs for physical commodities
485 2018-04-27 19:59:23 We will see sir. Commodities ALWAYS increase in value when there's a recession, whether it be major or minor. People will be strapped for cash on top of getting hit with increased pricing in a down economy. Double whammy.
486 2018-04-27 19:49:59 Sure. But I read Ella's criticism of your comparing poverty versus "incel" complaints as requiring seeing women as commodities, not people. Inequality isn't the issue, it's your notion that it's redressable using similar means.
487 2018-04-27 19:43:28 If you are concerned about a total power grid failure, energy would be better spent on self preservation training and not the cost of currencies/commodities.

Complete grid meltdown means massive geo-political upheaval and possibly WW3.
488 2018-04-27 19:34:30 Also, hint for @robinhanson: A post likes this makes it DAMN clear that you see women as interchangeable commodities, not as individual people with their own unique gifts to offer a partner. You want a fleshlight that can breathe and talk, not a woman.

500 2018-04-27 18:41:39 So I do have a theory, WM know that Scottish farming & fishing & our many brands are valuable tradable commodities, but also that they are small fry in British GDP terms (Scots farming & fishing both less than 1%). If they have control they can therefore trade these off easily
501 2018-04-27 18:38:11 It’s fine, we’ll just import lower standard commodities that have been treated with neonics and lots of other things that the elite of our great continent don’t want in their backyard

507 2018-04-27 17:58:10 Don't get hung up on non tariff barriers- the EU is the masters at those- outside the EU food prices should fall around 8% as huge tariffs on basic food commodities are removed- it will reduce our own animal feed  costs too as molasses , maize and soy are especially hard hit !
508 2018-04-27 17:51:36 Commodities look appealing with costs rising.
509 2018-04-27 17:51:09 Driven by greed and money. These people have no conscience, animals are seen as commodities, not sentient beings

511 2018-04-27 17:47:25 The black market is widespread in South Korea, mostly commodities, but also counterfeit luxury goods. This is the result of heavy government taxation on small business and corruption, though it’s also cultural. The haggle system is alive and well. 2/3

516 2018-04-27 17:17:02 Totally agree, the technology may have some interesting uses. The currencies are all just pyramid scheme commodities. Decentralized ledgers are neat technology, crypto currencies are stupid and antithetical to a functioning society.
517 2018-04-27 17:15:42 It’s Mad how the words of someone with some “influence” or “power” can shake the financial market. Can cause the rise or fall in prices of major commodities or foreign currencies. Then traders moving like chickens all over to fix prices. Just words ...

534 2018-04-27 15:38:52 You make a good point. But I'm sure that putting a child's education in the same basket with commodities as private roads, security guards, and water is a tad like the age-old "apples and oranges" argument.

547 2018-04-27 14:32:27 FHC tinha muitos defeitos, mas um mérito de ter estabilizado a economia com o plano real. Lula recebeu um presente, estava tudo resolvido, e ainda surfou a onda da valorização das commodities internacionais que trouxe muito dinheiro para o Brasil. Lula não tem mérito nenhum.

@KenyaPower at many times lay disconnection of power lines without customers consent. They don't even care what you use electricity for. Some of us use power to store very perishable commodities. We end up getting huge losses
610 2018-04-27 09:23:41 While on the side, they pushing these weed dispenseries like mf. As long they can tax commodities and get a cut it's the law in their eyesight.
611 2018-04-27 09:19:54 To which I would add a final thought; there are huge numbers of clues you encounter every day that tell you if the gov is performing well or poorly. The price of basic commodities, for example, & in past eras, women's hemlines believe it or not!

613 2018-04-27 09:01:49 there is no way commodities are going to fly and add in the lovely banking fiasco. Rates will be on hold forever or drop.

615 2018-04-27 08:57:16 Workers are alienated from these commodities. They can't afford them.
616 2018-04-27 08:56:40 Why don’t you throw some commodities in that excel sheet?

624 2018-04-27 07:49:53 The corporate definition of love is obsessed with commodities, property, and hoarding of things and experiences.
625 2018-04-27 07:41:48 Commodities Exchange has taken off at last, we've began with open outcry, one product: sesame (ufuta). We have had insurance companies, then banks, then a stock exchange. Now we have the TMX, fullblown capitalism. Nchi yetu inaingia phase mpya, tuombeeni.

629 2018-04-27 07:35:29 Nearly there, everything is out of control, inflation, prices of commodities, diplomatic relations, corruption, foreign usurpation of our territories, political persecution not to mention suppression of press freedom and arbitrary pocket declaration of Martial Law. Bingo na!
630 2018-04-27 07:34:37 Question:  Wouldn't the increase in price of basic commodities cancel out the increase in take-home funds?

634 2018-04-27 07:07:27 Year 9 GCSE Food & Nutrition students are working on different commodities this half term: fruit and veg, seasonality, where food comes from & air miles. When buying food in your weekly shop, think about #foodmiles & where food comes from. Visit a local farm shop #BuyBritish
635 2018-04-27 06:55:44 He said "most" & u r even saying "most of the UK", so what is the problem?! Those values Owen referred to are our assets & very important 2 most of the UK & should make u proud as well! Those values are not commodities to be exchanged for any amount of money!
636 2018-04-27 06:55:24 How about you visit interior Sindh where girls are still locked up as slaves and people treated like commodities bought & sold by your PPP supporting feudals!! What did PPP govt do for 5 years!! Utter respect for Bibi but none for AZ!!! @SakiaMMSS

639 2018-04-27 06:42:36 Kenya needs an agricultural value chain for all it’s commodities, until then all these efforts amount to naught.
640 2018-04-27 06:20:17 It's a good thing. It shows that Africa is not saturated in terms of the market.Nigeria needs to expand very fast to take advantage of this. We get emotional and want to join the world in a hurry. We must build first. agro commodities,  human capital and infrastructure.
641 2018-04-27 06:19:58 Good decision .It will help in building people confidance .IK should keep in mind the example of Ex-Governor West Pakistan AMEER MOHAMMAD KHAN.During 1965 War prices of all commodities were under control , No crime , no lawlessness .

644 2018-04-27 05:50:25 What is insane is this valuation as if they are mere commodities. They are children. A little boy & a little girl who love their parents & are loved by them. Rich or poor children are shaped by such love. This article dehumanises them and also you.
645 2018-04-27 05:46:07 I feel similarly. Modern token economy is very speculative, but back it by enough strong commodities, it takes on a different meaning.
646 2018-04-27 05:41:04 Perhaps something like Bancor could be used?  My initial thought is to only provide basket options for high-liquidity items. e.g., commodities would be the first things available for the basket (corn, silver, natural gas, etc.). Over time, more things could be made available.
647 2018-04-27 05:38:28 A feature of commodities is that they can be consumed or speculated in, so the risk that commodities would later be deemed securities because people treat them as speculative investments is remote
648 2018-04-27 05:22:22 @eikebatista De acordo com a visão do Banco, o cenário desejável para o futuro é desenvolver no país uma indústria fortemente exportadora, em contraposição a um negócio meramente fornecedor de commodities.  Entre as propostas apresentadas estão: celeridade no licenciamento
649 2018-04-27 05:13:40 I understand electricity is one of the most expensive commodities the world over. Can Zanu tell us where it is going get cheap electricity. For 39 yrs we have lived under load shedding due to shortage of electricity and today they say they will provide cheap power. Fake

652 2018-04-27 04:46:22 i think the fundamental difference is that such wildly different artists as ariel pink, dean blunt, and vektroid each take banalized aesthetics and repackage them as novel commodities for contemporary consumption. imitators saturate the supply and therefore crush the demand.

666 2018-04-27 03:13:50 This so called tax break was a bureaucratic hand job and has been washed away by higher fuel prices, food prices, commodities, and services.
