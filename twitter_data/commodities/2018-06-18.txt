4 2018-06-18 23:31:49 The illegal #migration industry is a form of commodities trading. If you #BuildTheWall in the US or here in Europe, costs to traffickers increase. Without mass volume enabled by lax borders, the industry slows. And less trafficking means less human suffering, esp children. LOGIC.

6 2018-06-18 23:06:46 I vote Liberal & want a clean environment but carbon taxes & Cap & Trade don’t stop pollution; they permit pollution for tax $.  Tax extravagant commodities & less obvious items for income. Stop what pollutes if you care about the environment. Too many taxes=punitive=no Liberals.

9 2018-06-18 22:50:30 Exactly! Govt. reports show that more than 80% of the 400k+ children in foster care were removed unjustly without justification.  It's a $$$$$ making racket for the states & the children are the commodities.
10 2018-06-18 22:32:40 I agree: I don't think commodities will begin a long term bull market right now. The 2000s commodities bull was driven by China.

China is done most of its massive infrastructure building programs.

38 2018-06-18 20:39:51 I loved visiting @SunterraMarket while I lived in Alberta. Such a treat to get a quick yummy lunch in downtown Edmonton. But not a fan of the messaging. Because we sell commodities, does that make me not a real farmer?
39 2018-06-18 20:35:44 On a high note, Canada lawmakers vote to legalize marijuana. The authorities will now tap into the smoking revenue that countries like Kenya are losing on while targeting basic commodities. Congrats to the Migunas on this milestone.
40 2018-06-18 20:34:31 $Dow and $S&P close lower, yet $SPI futures are up 40 points... What am I missing people? Oil was stronger and the Aussie market has been doing this a bit lately, taking cues from commodities rather than US equities... today should be fun #ASX

53 2018-06-18 19:22:05 oh for sure, thats how they’ve set it up, push blame and they change it, saving face. All a ruse with human lives being used as pawns and commodities.
54 2018-06-18 19:16:47 This corruption starts direct from the house of finance swimming to the house of assembly in the name of approval where they improve abnormal rates that vary way high than the actual price of commodities
55 2018-06-18 19:13:23 The fact they are known commodities "NOW" is exactly the point. What they were in year 1 and 2 means nothing to the conversation now. Those young guys are very talented and "COULD" have great futures. But I KNOW now that those 3 together give me a great shot at titles for years.
56 2018-06-18 19:09:09 I hate that flawed logic lol it’s ridiculous. The only one of those 3 (Kawhi, Bron, PG13) that was ever expected to be great was Lebron. The others are known commodities NOW but what were they in year 1 and 2? Again, use your brain NOT your desperation.
57 2018-06-18 19:07:36 i can‘t see inflation running hot. slowing growth, weak investment spending, wages in stagnation, uncertain consequences of political risk and maybe also ongoing qt... only real upside potential MAY come from commodities.
58 2018-06-18 19:04:38 ...for 2 of the top 3-5 best players in the NBA plus another AS in PG and 2 of those players are 27 & 28 years old meaning you have 5-7 years of elite years from them you do it. Bron, PG, Kawhi are known commodities, the young players you are hoping they become great.

62 2018-06-18 18:51:23 That link doesn't answer my questions. It shows GDP per capita since the 13th century which is a poor measure of living standards. Money that is backed by commodities such as gold and silver is not fiat money, so once again, which years are you referring to?

65 2018-06-18 18:32:58 Maybe you shouldn’t have seen them as commodities you were entitled to dismiss before they proved their value.
66 2018-06-18 18:22:09 Yes, we're preparing to slap tariffs on U.S. commodities, as are most other nations in the developed world.

68 2018-06-18 18:19:35 @realDonaldTrump in order to have true free trade you must open the borders to people and commodities in kind... this is basic Econ 101... are you prepared to issue green cards to every Canadian?
69 2018-06-18 18:17:45 I was just thinking the other day while driving down an old country road... the same road civil war soldiers used. Thinking back to a time when neighbors traded their commodities & helped others whether they could repay in kind or not. The commodity of character.
70 2018-06-18 18:05:33 Anthony is one of the best and brightest in this corner of the media world. He's brimming with ideas, enthusiasm, and good humor, all of which are rare commodities individually (and even more elusive as a whole package). Anyone would be lucky to add him to their staff.

80 2018-06-18 17:15:22 That's because people are not seen as people in the eyes of Democrats, who have thoughts and feelings, but rather as commodities, no different from "inanimate objects", to be USED for political gain and also cast aside when their usefulness is done.
81 2018-06-18 17:11:18 Yes--but they must also be FAIR markets...not like how EU has undercut Ag commodities in the past while subsidizing their farmers

88 2018-06-18 16:48:42 Income inequality is worse today than in revolutionary France or Russia because these people have gamed everything as commodities for personal profit. They're killing millions every year. Literally. Jail is fine so long as they are STOPPED.
89 2018-06-18 16:46:29 Well, the rhetoric appears to be hitting commodities prices and that is keeping inflation low. Perhaps the goal is to keep the Fed from raising rates.
90 2018-06-18 16:45:56 Basically, some large corporation is making $ off fat government contracts to give bare bones care to frightened children separated from parents. These children are simply commodities. Does that sound about right? #EndFamilySeparation #ConcentrationCamps
91 2018-06-18 16:45:42 O ciclo positivo de commodities é também derivado de uma contração na oferta (menos projetos entrando em operação), e não somente de aumento da demanda, confere?
92 2018-06-18 16:40:46 Agree. Commodities seem to be a pure technical asset class unless you’re a producer or physical trader in the flow. No income, no growth, just factors of production. And yes, I get riding backward curves.
93 2018-06-18 16:38:46 when is Bloomberg going to do an event in Nigeria on "Comparative Advantage in Export Commodities"? You need to sit these guys down and educate them. Cassava is like $150/ton, Rice is like $500/ton. Cassava export can cover some cost of rice importation. Simple!
94 2018-06-18 16:31:31 It is a sad state of affairs. For how long has it been happening. Are the other commodities safe or they have their share of surprises in wait?
95 2018-06-18 16:29:38 And matiang'i is busy burning gaming machines rather than facing the cartels who are selling poisonous commodities to Kenyans...poor priorities...banana republic...
96 2018-06-18 16:29:30 Honourable prime minister shri narendra modi ji why r prices of commodities, petrol,  diesel,  milk always increasing sir?
97 2018-06-18 16:26:37 @narendramodi Dear Sir, Don't you think If we reduce the taxes on Petrol & Diesel the prices of the essential commodities will automatically come down and to compensate the taxes increase the Excise on liquor products and tobacco taxes. This will also ensure healthy habits.
98 2018-06-18 16:16:19 #JosefSchachter says in his 40 year career he's only seen 2 major bull markets in energy and he believes that he will see the 3rd starting in late 2018. It's going to be a major bull market in all commodities lasting 5-6 years.

This jives with my prediction for the $TSX.
@tsxman
99 2018-06-18 16:13:11 Sorry Simon but in following @ONS and the Bank of England you are mistaken as it we need a new index allowing for the fact that commodities are priced in US $
100 2018-06-18 16:12:15 Trump uses children as leverage to get what he wants. He threatened DACA recipients to try & force taxpayers to fund his stupid wall. Now he’s doing the same thing with innocent children at the border. People are merely commodities to be used for Trump.
101 2018-06-18 16:11:21 "Granting of foreign aid is often conditional upon economic reform of various sorts; a foreign aid package may be in kind, takes the form of specific commodities like wheat or computers or foreign exchange that can be used only for the purchase of particular commodities" (2)
102 2018-06-18 16:09:09 Sir are we suppose to allow the investment in ajaokuta go down the drain because of cheap commodities coming from Asia. It has to function before private investors come on stream. That is the Nigeria story. We don’t start new business but invest in what is functional.
103 2018-06-18 16:06:45 Yet trade in most Commodities remains 'essential' category and cannot be wished away. If aversion rises, only risk premium would go up.
104 2018-06-18 16:02:35 The annoying part about Twitter vendors is that many of them don't have shops, so they don't pay rent.

All the expenses that come with owning a real shop do not apply to them, yet their commodities are ridiculously expensive.

We will keep entering your DM to price & leave.
105 2018-06-18 16:02:16 Why do you only hate the women in this exchange? They are disadvantaged because society values them as sexual commodities. He was the powerful one and he took advantage. He may have had consensual sexual relationships, but that doesn’t change the fact that he has raped women!
106 2018-06-18 16:02:00 Marvin Jones led the league in deep ball receptions last year.  Tate did his usual damage.  Hill is fast, caught a few home run balls, but what else?  Watkins has been a bust who “hopes” to get on track.  I’ll take the two proven commodities, with a side of Kenny Golladay.
107 2018-06-18 16:00:18 Love is more admired than success or wealth. Never sacrifice love for lower commodities. 
108 2018-06-18 15:49:03 Uncomfortable?! Cry me a river.  They are cages.  These children are being treated as commodities and inhumanely.  Don't let DHS ICE DOJ get away with this misspeak!

114 2018-06-18 15:19:00 Oh pleeeeease!  They were fucking eating each other before we colonised them.  We gave them freedom of speech, trial by jury, governments and democracy! and more  Whatever commodities they had - they were wiping their arses with!
115 2018-06-18 15:17:14 Potência regional como o Brasil não pode depender de exportação de commodities. Precisamos de um projeto nacional voltado para melhoria de infraestrutura, ampliação de investimentos em pesquisa e desenvolvimento, inovação etc e produzir/exportar bens com maior valor agregado.
116 2018-06-18 15:16:00 Hace oposición sin histeria_burrada. En 2014 los commodities se desplomaron. Es el mayor sector en el PIB. Las inversiones que aumentaron fueron a la construcción, industria, servicios pero tienen menor peso. Compará con otros exportadores de commodities.
117 2018-06-18 15:12:43 Creo q la 2 da mitad del ano va a favorecer a la region x suba en $Commodities y p ello tiene q subir $ORO y bajar $USDollar y esoooo favoreceria a acc d $Metales&Mineria incluida $VALE, pero creo q el liderazgo inicial deberia ser a partir d $Bancos, es decir arranque x $ITUB,
118 2018-06-18 15:12:03 This is China's real unforgivable sin: Wash DC has finally woken up to the reality that China is using our USD-centric system against itself to methodically acquire control of valuable commodities (real wealth) globally.

123 2018-06-18 15:00:26 She asks, "Where does this end?" and he proceeds to incorrectly mansplain a trade war while not answering the question. 

All of his (wrong) assumptions about the targeted commodities being fungible and tariffs just moving trade around assume escalation beyond this point. Why?

133 2018-06-18 14:30:57 Because international commodities such as oil are priced in U.S. dollars, America can bring sanctions against countries like Iran and Russia. Our nation's most dangerous adversaries want to change that, and China is leading the charge by buying oil from Russia with the yuan.

But now the US *has* lots of cheap gas... and no way to use it, so it ships out low-value commodities, and ships back others. Tariffs will accelerate change.

181 2018-06-18 10:14:11 There was a time when money had a value based on certain commodities e.g. gold or silver. Nowadays, it has no intrinsic value. It's value is based on the goodwill of the government that issues it.

198 2018-06-18 09:06:56 I see your point, especially about the size of the European internal market. But I think a more obvious analogy is the commodities trade.

208 2018-06-18 07:44:07 I love the idea of increasing the taxes on imported goods as a way to encourage the consumption of goods made within Uganda. And this can also help increase exports, for if you can buy your own commodities, other countries will also be willing to do so.  #KnowYourBudget18

238 2018-06-18 04:58:07 but you're not carrying around sexual commodities that need constant mindfulness agnst the lowest impulses of thirsty strangers.

it's both of those combined that make our world.

239 2018-06-18 04:44:46 I hope people remember this when considering buying from a breeder, most of whom consider these animals commodities and not precious beings deserving of love. If you want a specific breed of dog or cat there are rescues nationwide that specialize in all breeds of cats and dogs.

242 2018-06-18 04:35:50 Competent "brains", if effectively marketed, represent a much more desirable form of capital than that which is required to conduct a business dealing in commodities, because "brains" are a form of capital which cannot be permanently depreciated through depressions. #NapoleonHill

245 2018-06-18 04:30:04 Honey, we were poor when I was a kid. Beans and taters and cornbread poor. Used commodities for I think 4 months until mom got a job. Wasn't the best, but we made do. I know kids who could use extra help. It's despicable for able bodied to game the system.

251 2018-06-18 03:22:14 Sure. I don't think basic necessities like health care, shelter and so on should be treated like other commodities--and in practice, society and governments offer basic provisions of these because we recognize what a free market in these things must mean.

258 2018-06-18 02:34:41 I look to have been wrong on my PM call to move higher with a stronger USD. While I was very happy with commodities trades in 2017, my record in 2018 is not good and most gains are given back.  Stepping aside for now. Only focus is SPX. Commodities are tough and unforgiving.

262 2018-06-18 01:32:00 This has ALWAYS been about $ and it is about exploiting these people (along with everyone else). The children are commodities.

263 2018-06-18 01:24:11 this doesn't exhaust the forms of "creative destruction" that exist (for example, we see the destruction of old commodities for the new, and old techniques for production, happening at a rapid pace underneath the spiral of crisis. But relations of crisis define large paradigms).
