MS patients should grovel at his feet for the money he dumped into the stocks to make more. He is proud he is lying.

7 2018-08-08 23:53:50 No but am not thinking short term but rather picking up stock in international micro-cap E&P's that are being priced at stupid levels. International micro-cap & small-cap oil stocks are the option that never expires. Deep value & diversification provide the margin of safety.

15 2018-08-08 23:47:00 This is only a huge deal in 2 stock formats. Meter growth rate and mechanics are super important in deciding it's viability. Stocks disappearing easily for the whole cast isn't the same type of balance issue as 1/50 characters having broken kill confirms.

42 2018-08-08 23:41:22 Dems are and were heavily invested in pharma, biotech, healthcare, & healthcare insurance. Including before passing ACA. Which helped insurance companies stocks so has anyone investigated Dems stock purchases & holdings prior to that vote?
43 2018-08-08 23:41:07 Would he be doing all this though if his stocks weren't plummeting through the floor.
44 2018-08-08 23:40:43 A Melee Ironman is each person playing with 20 stocks split across 5 characters

A Smash 4 Ironman is a challenge where you try to win a match as every character on the roster.
45 2018-08-08 23:40:21 The fishing industry in the UK represents 0.1% of GDP. Why are you interested in living in the 1970s? Can't be anything to do with fishing stocks since the North Sea's have been depleted by over fishing. We can't just magic fish stocks from nowhere.

That film featured over 3000 cuts (most feature only 600-700) and employed a wide range of camera angles, filters, film stocks, lenses, and special effects. That is my template for 'WOT'. I'm even more inspired by the
47 2018-08-08 23:39:03 Not sure what eccentric CEOs of blue chips (broadly speaking) seek to gain out of making their shareholders panic. Many of those shareholders are not experienced investors, they simply buying into trends. So when the stocks crash, these people suffer the most.

49 2018-08-08 23:38:45 Stocks market is very much a marathon. “Buy and hold” is the name of the game from what i see
50 2018-08-08 23:38:35 @zerowondering how many stocks do you think the new game will use 2? 3? Or even 5?
51 2018-08-08 23:37:45 @NECA_TOYS. How does one become the person that stocks the Neca items at retail?  Is it a 3rd party company?   I'm looking for a 2nd job. ;)
52 2018-08-08 23:36:38 Most of good(?) stocks, usually more calls than puts on total OI, does it mean then stocks will go down? Don’t think so.
53 2018-08-08 23:36:00 I shot almost all of my trip to Alaska and shot about 108 exposures between 3 different film stocks. Very excited to get the results back
54 2018-08-08 23:35:15 Stamina Mode not only is part of Standard Smash now, but ALSO has Stocks which is what I've been waiting for since fucking Melee.

THEY FINALLY FIXED THE MODE TO WHAT IVE ALWAYS WANTED. OH MY GOD.
55 2018-08-08 23:35:07 Tesla should just give a public briefing asking for Saudi Arabia to free up all political prisoners and ban the death penalty, etc... They would sell the stocks immediately like they did to Canada...
56 2018-08-08 23:35:01 Con respecto a materias primas empresas pueden tener stocks
57 2018-08-08 23:33:54 Maybe Tesla should give a similar communication to have the Saudi funds out of its stocks?
58 2018-08-08 23:32:45 It’s certainly a reg FD concern and shorts are correct in pushing that narrative, as should longs, no positioners, and the SEC. can’t have cryptic tweets sending stocks flying around. We’re trying to keep Stratton Oakmont’s out of the markets these days.
59 2018-08-08 23:31:50 stocks in the company. Or just guaranteed pre-release access to new systems/titles.
60 2018-08-08 23:30:46 Mannn I need to learn how to invest in stocks. That where the money is fr fr.
61 2018-08-08 23:30:44 I think if were going to allow smash meter we could make it 4 stocks. That should be fine. 
It would be interesting if we did stage transition where winner of RPS decides to pick starting or ending stage & the other picks a stage with the slot left over.
62 2018-08-08 23:29:48 No not really if we didnt have kill confirms we wouldnt have players getting to certain percents abd then fishing all game for the grab or that certain hit. It would actually take skill to take stocks.

67 2018-08-08 23:25:51 I personally don't get people who get paid ONLY in crypto. Obviously some people like to be paid a portion of their salary in crypto just like some people like to have it paid in stocks
68 2018-08-08 23:25:39 History repeats first it was the stocks and this time will be #cryptocurrency
69 2018-08-08 23:23:35 I think meter final smash should just be a side event with 4 stocks
70 2018-08-08 23:23:19 If you set up your friends and family with stocks you get inside info on, for gosh sake, set up a safeword for if it tanks.  "At the President's party today.  Looking forward to going out for SHORTCAKE!  #shortcake"

73 2018-08-08 23:21:53 No, it’s a trading platform for the foreign exchange market, where you trade currency for currency, much like stocks. You can start up a demo account to test it out and once you get confident you can put real money into it.
74 2018-08-08 23:20:26 Ryan Stocks, is that better.
75 2018-08-08 23:20:24 I don’t think that would save them at this point. Stocks would take years to rebound
76 2018-08-08 23:20:11 To everyone sitting on the fence about voting Dem of GOP. No one said anything about taking away your guns. AR 15 & bump stocks should be illegal period. All other guns should be registered & purchased only after someone is 21 & older.A five day waiting period is not unreasonable
77 2018-08-08 23:20:06 Unless there was a recording of talks between father & son, how does anyone tie that to illegality re: stocks. When someone takes a huge financial hit for not dropping stock after learning of failed test results for a company, seems... son coulda got the news via someone else.
78 2018-08-08 23:19:59 Just thought about that time me and my college roomies woke up to hella corn stocks in our common room back at roe cloud  what was we really on tho 
79 2018-08-08 23:19:55 It was fun (and maybe even funNY) for a while, right?
80 2018-08-08 23:18:48 Senator, sell your health care stocks. Owning millions in health care stocks undercuts everything you say regarding this issues. Leave the conflicts of interest in business to Trump.
81 2018-08-08 23:18:39 Minecraft couldn't return at out of control stocks !
82 2018-08-08 23:18:11 Yes, I invest - mostly in my 401k with an employer that matches my contributions,
But here are more ways your money can make more money:
- Peer to Peer Lending
- Angel Investing
- Invest in stocks & shares
83 2018-08-08 23:16:41 With over 100 stages would it be fair to have maybe a dozen legal ones to choose from? Imo the meter brings a different element to the game which could make things interesting. And what do YOU think would be fair; 2 or 3 stocks?

93 2018-08-08 23:11:03 Dear Josh,
You already made millions from selling your Uber stocks in the SoftBank deal. You have a multimillion dollar apartment in UWS. Meanwhile wages has gone down for drivers in NYC and you fail to mention it in the interview. 
Set an example for your kids.
94 2018-08-08 23:10:21 @SawBeGoz what do you and your team use to trade? Have you ever messed with meta trader (mobile)? Also you trade Forex...stocks...crypto or what?
95 2018-08-08 23:09:27 How can their be so many millionaires in Congress and the House when on a government salary of $190,000 thats impossible to save unless you never spend a dime. All of them need to be looked at to see how they made their money and what committee they were on and stocks they held.
96 2018-08-08 23:07:58 @realDonaldTrump thoughts on Rep. Chris Collins? Drain the Swamp? Wow! Who else did he tell about the stocks? Can’t wait to find out.
97 2018-08-08 23:07:43 Trump is huge inside trader! His tweets raise and drop stocks. I want to see all of his friends stock accounts and run a check on who traded specific stocks before he tweets. The SEC should have already done this!
98 2018-08-08 23:06:08 F-iT I’m going to lay down more support tonight slightly under the $HMNY Bid  NO MORE GAMES! 

 I’m going to start laying down more support: AKA MORE SMALL MULTIPLE LIMIT-BUYS EVERY DAY FOR FREE USING RH & OTHER ACCOUNTS, to stop the bears from creating fake dumps so quickly.
99 2018-08-08 23:04:45 No different than futures, which is obviously index trading too. You couldn't pay me enough to go back to that in my lifetime. The mental capital that is used on index trading was unbelievably taxing for me.

Individual stocks with TI scanning... Why look at indexes? 
100 2018-08-08 23:04:35 Aren't those retirement accounts feeding the shorts with stocks?
101 2018-08-08 23:04:05 Who says they have a normal crop?  Also demand is demand. You can’t deny world demand for soybean protein is growing YOY.  Don’t take this the wrong way but your tone exemplifies the complacency this market has.  We don’t have comfortable stocks of the unthinkable happens.

105 2018-08-08 23:02:02 Check in with the @ABrindisiNY campaign folks and your local @IndivisibleTeam for details. Any chance she trades Australian pharma stocks like @RepChrisCollins?

107 2018-08-08 23:00:07 Generational wealth is something more black people need to learn about and grasp. Save for your children from when they're born. Invest in property and stocks. It's time for the average black family to catch up to the average white family in wealth
108 2018-08-08 22:58:48 What's that imply ?

114 2018-08-08 22:53:21 I keep myself away from those stocks because of those reasons yes.They are VERY difficult to manage, expeciallty for New traders. I find every service teaching those stocks, no good. Thats why I ask theese questions
115 2018-08-08 22:51:50 The game wasn’t meant for competitive use to begin with. Once Sakurai saw it develop he started adding in some suitable options such as the custom ruleset with stocks, time etc. However this isn’t gonna stop him adding in casual stuff as the game was intended to be played in.

119 2018-08-08 22:49:43 sort of it is all in stocks and Bonds, which i artfully trade
120 2018-08-08 22:49:42 I am serious. There are many people who just make money by trading tesla stocks. For some people extreme volatility is an opportunity.

122 2018-08-08 22:47:59 @cvpayne Chas, enjoyed this months extensive newsletter update. Anxious for many of my stocks to get out of the red zone, CBRL, ESIO, RRC, ODFL. Hopefully September reporting will bump some into the positive range. Cheers!

124 2018-08-08 22:47:36 Bro I'm trying to write a book on it. I would love to know the reasons too. I've been researching drops as stocks for over a year now.  Theres so many factors- hype? stock? 1st release? If its 2nd how many years has it been in between. I think it's wholesalers with FSRs.1/2

127 2018-08-08 22:46:25 Does @RepBuddyCarter have stocks in medical technology or research drugs, like Rep. Collins, indicted and arrested today by the FBI?
128 2018-08-08 22:46:14 Don't do it kids.
We're turning social media into their pillory and mockery is the rotten fruit we're throwing. You'll end up in the stocks of public opinion if you act like a fucktard.

132 2018-08-08 22:45:04 Well cell phone records, emails and publically trading (dumping) stocks online leave a pretty good trail.

136 2018-08-08 22:43:28 I heard his were Australian held stocks. The other 2 people involved had US held stocks.
137 2018-08-08 22:42:45 @CliffordAsness Does QMJ explain the low beta anomaly? I would hypothesize lower beta stocks are higher quality because their lower cyclicality makes long term planning easier.
138 2018-08-08 22:42:30 Well that sucks lol let the feeders party too!
139 2018-08-08 22:42:29 Since all these companies are publicly traded, I think anyone who has stock invested regardless of the positive return, whom disagrees with the censorship of free speech, whether that speech includes political views or not, should pull out their stocks and leave them hanging.
140 2018-08-08 22:41:29 It's no problem though. It would just be interesting to see you playing more stocks that I do. But I agree, stick to the niche that works for you, I will too. Was a quriouse question about your service, thats all 
141 2018-08-08 22:41:20 Well maybe one good thing about this week is that when bay does go, fes will realize jc is one of the ones who has “flipped” every week.
142 2018-08-08 22:41:04 @TinaSmithMN Medical Stocks. Conflict of Interest ? You are next. Orange is the New Black.
143 2018-08-08 22:39:50 He saturated the media with his manipulative tweet  only for his selfish agenda to artificially Inflate TSLA stock undeserved with roughly +37 points. Also caused the other Stocks positions to reverse or lose momentum
144 2018-08-08 22:39:42 That'd be dope haha, funny enough I've been given tips in the past. Seems whenever Nvidia, Intel or AMD releases details about a new graphics card or processor, their stocks rise up. Like when the GTX Tesla P100 came out.
145 2018-08-08 22:38:55 Everyday I have a logical adrenaline rush because of stocks.
146 2018-08-08 22:38:37 If you think that is an excellent idea, I have some penny stocks for sale, mostly in stuff like Mongolian Yak Fur futures.
147 2018-08-08 22:38:23 You can not buy a gun online or from a dealer at a show without a BG check: where did you hear that?

How do you see restricting large capacity mags as helping? Parkland shooter had a knapsack of loaded mags and reloaded at least four times.

Bump stocks are trivia.

148 2018-08-08 22:37:43 I am a past union president; We all know that big industry or states are against unions. All unions need to unite, this gives more power.  Any investment should be in housing or overseas stock markets. When you invest in US stocks you invest in those whom want to  destroy unions.
149 2018-08-08 22:37:31 Who cares who he backed, he committed fraud, insider trading. The thread seems like people don’t even know that Collins & his family sold stocks based on insider info on a failed drug trial.  This is not Trump issue. It’s a criminal issue of a corrupt politician. #ResignCollins
150 2018-08-08 22:36:59 Stop to the gambeling stocks
151 2018-08-08 22:36:24 These Congressmen all doing pretty well working in the public sector & able to buy thousands of dollars worth of stocks. Did Collins warn them the bottom was about to fall out too ?
152 2018-08-08 22:36:18 Another coffee boy, I mean Congressman, has done what?  No time for oversight of mistreatment of little ones, women's maternal health issues, or how to cut drug costs, but plenty of time to call friends and fellow coffee boys to trade stocks& be the 1st to endorse Head Tweeter.
153 2018-08-08 22:36:16 I understand he broke the rule, it's not about that. We all do that. I am asking about you playing larger float stocks, I dont see you post plays of larger float stocks, only low floats...
It's just a valid question from a trader who plays larger floats...
154 2018-08-08 22:35:54 Your acting like every meter is a 1 shot like marths lol. You know there are 70+ characters in the game right? Also, we can even use 4 stocks if ppl are dying too quick. And who's to say that you dont lose your meter when you get hit enough?
155 2018-08-08 22:35:43 He didn't sell his own stocks, but his son, his son's fiancee, her parents all were able to sell theirs.
156 2018-08-08 22:34:52 Do you see an impact on Brazil's poultry industry from tight soya, as China cleans out stocks?
157 2018-08-08 22:32:27 Background checks for online sales and for all sales at gun shows for starters. As far as mass shootings go, restrict large capacity mags. Restrict bump stocks. Give courts more authority to confiscate weapons from ppl who are considered a threat to themselves or others
158 2018-08-08 22:31:36 $Stocks  I am finding out thru this EPS season that the names i’ve been the most patient with & started with less but methodically built positions have fared better
159 2018-08-08 22:31:35 How is anything this guy did different than what @SecPriceMD did? They both dumped stocks with information gleaned from their positions as servant to the people. And they’re both Trump lackeys. Crooked AF.
160 2018-08-08 22:31:08 If you keep meter between stocks I'm fine with it, otherwise it's just too oppressive
161 2018-08-08 22:30:46 Cant come up with solid PTs without more info from CEO other than vague. I know Art sounds confident so I think it will be very nice return. $BGFT is working on merger so targets can be determined by comparable stocks. .0019/.005/.0075 for $BGFT is our targets but could hit .015
162 2018-08-08 22:30:38 Finally! Something close to doing his job! Now he needs to call all those GOPers in and read them the riot act about any involvement for profit or power in businesses, stocks, committees where there’s conflict of interest! This is a Betrayal of Public Trust 101 and GOP’s guilty!

166 2018-08-08 22:28:37 Meanwhile they allow ads from folks claiming to teach them how to trade penny stocks and get rich overnight for a small fee of $ XXX. & yes I've seen an ad like this before.
167 2018-08-08 22:27:15 Yeah 4 stocks is definitely the way to go with meter, would be hyyyype though. Gonna run this set up for my local scene when the game comes out.
168 2018-08-08 22:26:51 Hm should I make a custom shape stocks tutorial?
169 2018-08-08 22:26:26 While there are 15 5w+ bases on the 83-name watchlist, this is an unimpressive mkt, thanks to the avgs' quick pullback & recovery, which left many issues w/ 2-3w patterns. Naz acts well, by showing reduced range Tues/Wed at its prior hi. It could easily break higher #stocks
170 2018-08-08 22:25:37 Besides, the meta for number of stocks has changed every game. I wouldn't be concerned about it making games too short or anything.

172 2018-08-08 22:25:02 A lot of shares are owned by large funds, that only hold positions in exchangetraded stocks. How can they "remain"?
173 2018-08-08 22:23:53 Please introduce legislature where they all divest stocks and invest in index funds to eliminate conflicts of interest.  Then they will be invested in the entire economy.

177 2018-08-08 22:22:31 Disclaimer: I have no positions in either of the stocks. Just throwing out my 2 cents.
178 2018-08-08 22:21:24 Really? Is not this a valid question? I am not shaming or trowing shit, I am asking this because I dont play low float stocks....
179 2018-08-08 22:21:21 My stocks finally hit $90 per share, I think it's time to sell haha
180 2018-08-08 22:21:13 Ahhhh the thought of Pro Stocks back at OCFS @OcfsRacing makes me get goosebumps!

183 2018-08-08 22:19:32 To me it's just a non-starter it's economically going to drain us. People like myself will buy the medical stocks and get incredibly wealthy while people making under 25-50k a year would see a massive increase in taxes.

186 2018-08-08 22:19:04 My opinion about FSM being legal in competitive play:

Fire Emblem characters kinda' ruined it, tbh. Unblockable supers that can kill you 20-30 does not sound fair, even if you bump up the stocks.

192 2018-08-08 22:17:31 I didn't say there was any correlation to Alex Jones. I think he's a fringe fearmongerer. FB stocks obviously dropped before this situation. Stockholders care about social media censoring conservatives, bc it won't stop with them. Even if it did, conservatives could exit...

196 2018-08-08 22:12:06 Th hardest part will be choosing the stage list. People seem to agree the 3 stocks will be good,and while people will consider the chargable final smash i'm thinking most won't want it in.
197 2018-08-08 22:11:34 no reason to snitch. there’s nothing to snitch. they’re hoping he will compose (lie) he won’t. Do you even know what the charges are? Great economy lowest unemployment, stocks doing great. Ya real sociopath. I guess you missed one Mueller announced that Trump himself was cleared.

200 2018-08-08 22:10:06 Reminded of seeing Oprah doing Weight Watcher commercials (after their stocks declined/she's a major shareholder) Thinking YTF is she doing ads?- "Oprah effect". Turkcell trades on NYSE. 2.2 billion Turkcell shares are down atm :P "Save, save the shareholders of Turkcell"
201 2018-08-08 22:09:51 may it please the court - the wooden stocks for the inside trader, facing the sun, with old tomatoes and throwable melons for the visitors, no commutation, and sentencing appropriate to the egregiousness, insult and stupidity of the offenses..
202 2018-08-08 22:08:40 I currently own some stocks. I’m from Spain. How is possible for me if I want to continue being stockholder? I believe in Tesla as a long term investment. But I’m not sure how will it happen
203 2018-08-08 22:08:18 Making 10% is not near that simple.. respectable modern retirement forecasting would never use that number.  Even if you put 100% of your money in s&p type stocks (dumb), you'd have made about 6% annually in the 21st century.  Save more, spend less.

50k SGD stocks (Green status) 

100+K SGD Cryptos (Red status)
206 2018-08-08 22:05:55 I kind of like the idea of stocks with stamina. Makes it very similar to other fighting games in a way but I highly doubt that'll be the new standard. Still a fun new way to play competitive smash though.

Please try to see the bigger picture.

Oh yes, and consider the sustainability of fish stocks...
214 2018-08-08 21:59:57 I think the maximum timer on a smash game should be 6.5 minutes, even with 3 stocks. If your game can't do a stock every minute and a half/2 minutes, drop the stock number

3/8 in brawl was bad, should've been 2/6 probably

Melee should be 4/7 or 4/6 cuz melee goes by so fast

216 2018-08-08 21:58:54 Targeted ads are getting smart about baiting me. I don't get "sexy single asians in your area" anymore, now it's "big-name pot stocks with ascending profit projections"
217 2018-08-08 21:58:30 and if you consider your total amount of stocks as a health bar, losing a stock to final smash is pretty comparable to getting hit with super in literally any other fighting game
218 2018-08-08 21:57:13 Or just 3 stocks but instead of stocks it's three characters
219 2018-08-08 21:57:12 Like I’ve watched the movie thousands of times before stocks but like understanding truly what the movie is and the definition of everything speaks out to me so much more now, when I understood the market and everything. It’s crazy.
220 2018-08-08 21:56:21 I would love 3V3 characters over just 1 character with 3 stocks.

It would be far more interesting.  It's what I prefer about King of Fighters, Marvel vs Capcom and Dragonball over say ... Street Fighter, Injustice, Tekken (not tag), Mortal Kombat etc.
221 2018-08-08 21:55:29 Ok, but I have followed you both for a while, and I rarely see you post plays of larger float stocks.
222 2018-08-08 21:55:20 happy to help, working class actor, writer and director (also agent) had lots of ups and downs due to working class background really happy to discuss and help if possible
223 2018-08-08 21:55:20 Yeah the 3v3 format is definitely interesting. I wonder whether it'd be fast enough to do bo3s so you can switch teams (like in DBFZ) or if it'd take too long. Also need to consider stocks
224 2018-08-08 21:54:45 Hard at work creating traffics and damaging cars....all you are good for.

227 2018-08-08 21:53:07 I'm sorry dude but, it appears that this garbage is done. TED and his associates destroyed investors, including myself. I hope you're correct but, I don't see this company ever turning around.

230 2018-08-08 21:50:24 @webberllc is a POS company whose workers damage private property and then refuses to communicate with the public to resolve those issues. A company that sucks on the taxpayer teat and gives the middle finger in return. This is a garbage company.

232 2018-08-08 21:48:49 Study showed that the senate has a 12% Better return on stocks than the public. So they passed a rule so senators have to disclose their trades within 45 days. It cut senator trades by 75%. They literally are all crooks.
233 2018-08-08 21:47:54 We need a new generation of leadership that will impose serious rules for all politicians. Like term limits. And rules about not owning stocks.
234 2018-08-08 21:47:37 What if you could set it to change only when stocks are taken

242 2018-08-08 21:45:00 Oui et non. C'est assez difficile à gérer en terme de stocks et d'invendus. Il faut du flux et un personnel bien formé pour se le permettre. Donc plutôt des restaurants d'un certain standing.
243 2018-08-08 21:45:00 Absurdist meme humour is on a downward trend, sell all stocks now. Invest in anime memes that make fun of anime and that are self aware. Anime has never been more mainstream than it is now

246 2018-08-08 21:44:10 I think a more responsible decision by the stock exchanges would be to make short selling illegal in in some stocks where there is clearly illegal behavior on behalf of shortselling investors.
247 2018-08-08 21:43:23 Minimum age; universal background check; no mentally ill or domestic abusers, ban bump stocks, for a few. Loopholes-gun show purchases that have different sales requirements-close that loophole. But you know all this. You’re just being obtuse

249 2018-08-08 21:42:22 Don't you ask dumbass questions like "does white supremacy stop a black man from buying stock?" What does buying a stock have to do with not getting killed by race soldiers and getting no justice (which is white supremacy) what does stocks have to do with philando castile?

267 2018-08-08 21:32:35 bro, if that GUY can pull off AWX and call it a hostile takeover, proof of INTENTION is easy. How many LOI Letter of intent bs PRs have we all seen over the years pumping stocks? and LEGAL.  Bro this is the game. Dont hate the player... hate the game lol
268 2018-08-08 21:32:24 The potential to have a nearly-definite way to end stocks is really good for viewership, but I'm not sure how much weight that needs to play in a competitive environment.
269 2018-08-08 21:32:17 Fascinating. Of all the products, I'm surprised they focused on these. I thought it was the margin on stocks that was the most disruptive
270 2018-08-08 21:31:15 I would love to see meter final smash at 4-5 stocks.  I look forward to studying this game inside and out!

275 2018-08-08 21:29:55 I understand why some may be sceptical, once bitten.... but i think regardless of RFP which now looks v positive, a PPA or two could land and the gas is there. Start a smaller scale op and scale up. As always with AIM no guarantees as we’ve seen in two stocks this week
276 2018-08-08 21:29:24 So first of all. This is actually bullshit! Its a header with a few stocks and shapes. You can't copy someone if literally EVERYONE does the same design in this com. Just for example, do you say to a freelance designer "your work is copied by Eric Fallis, Mixo" or anybody else?
277 2018-08-08 21:28:17 the anger i receive when i tell people who suggest that i invest in stocks “nah i wanna die penniless” brings me great joy
278 2018-08-08 21:27:45 WHO CAN SHOW ME HOW TO DO STOCKS?!??
279 2018-08-08 21:27:20 I wonder if other actions will be taken against the gop that held the same stocks? Perhaps the insider trading investigation will expand.
280 2018-08-08 21:27:08 It's fun to learn and grow and right now I'm learning to create portfolio income by investing in stocks. Humility is a must if you want to come anywhere in life!
281 2018-08-08 21:27:07 Yes. Their stocks would literally crash in record time lol  Hmmmm  maybe we should plan something? 
282 2018-08-08 21:27:00 There's two ways to 'think' the economy is good: (1) you actually believe the economy is good, in which case, you have the WRONG people working for you, or (2) you know the economy is fake, but it's fakeness is good for the illusion of being good for the herd bidding up stocks.
283 2018-08-08 21:26:24 @Sphinx3peat @kiku124 $IQ lower $ROKU higher. Cycles change in stocks/markets and continually need to adapt to what's hot and what's not.
284 2018-08-08 21:25:53 Epic stock trashing on wall street today, if not the last year entirely. Correlation with financials nonexistent, stocks beating earnings and forecasts get trashed if not on wall street insider's preferred list, hundreds of great companies affected, undermining all investing/SCAM
285 2018-08-08 21:25:34 Just learned that Rep Chris Collins R-NY was arrested for insider trading today for calling his son from the white house picnic when he learned that a drug trial had failed so he could sell his stocks in that company.  Democrats need to run against the Corruption in the GOP.

315 2018-08-08 21:10:51 Cashing out their stocks while the market is high and due for a correction. Pretty easy answer on that one.

326 2018-08-08 21:06:59 You can lose an infinite amount of money shorting but lose only what you invested if you’re long. Tesla is very volatile and sometimes unpredictable.

358 2018-08-08 20:57:09 We’ve Seen This Before

Losses from new technologies is nothing new. Today, we have ICOs and cryptocurrencies. Twenty years ago, it was initial public offerings (IPOs) and internet stocks.

Remember Webvan? You could order groceries online and have them delivered to your home.
359 2018-08-08 20:56:02 Notice how it's all of the has been ACTOR'S yelling the loudest? They should return every penny of the tax cuts, stocks and retirement money they have made since Jan 2016!
360 2018-08-08 20:55:33 Yes, because everyone has an awesome 401k and tons of stocks. If you pay closer attention, you'll notice that the sm has all the hallmarks of a bubble.
361 2018-08-08 20:55:29 You got proof ? I ain’t seeing it I do see corporations using their free money to buy back stocks and reward CEOs and shareholders
362 2018-08-08 20:55:28 I am in agreement because I always wanted final smashes as meter tbh.

My fingers are crossed that Sakurai executes this in the best way possible.

I wanna see some crisp meter gaining engine.

I also want this to be a stronger reason to advocate for more stocks.

Time to study!!
363 2018-08-08 20:54:35 thats why a real nigga use my rewards money from my credit card to flip stocks. free money to make more money. thats how you finesse the system

369 2018-08-08 20:50:35 Chargeable specials are the most interesting thing for me in the direct. Might be enough of a change the standard match to three stocks. Fingers crossed they're not too strong. I forget, is it possible to whiff a final smash in Ultimate?

I'm with you on pursuing the case but shut up ffs.
371 2018-08-08 20:48:55 Thanks for answering. It is not illegal here so that's why I was wondering...I assume Cooke doesn't use same stocks internationally? Either way, improvements needs to be made with water based aquaculture.
372 2018-08-08 20:48:40 The Stock Market is NOT the Economy.  You've done NOTHING for the Economy. The stock market's up only because CEOs are buying back their own companies' stocks, artificially inflating their prices in what's known as speculative fraud.  It's just another Wall St speculative bubble.

386 2018-08-08 20:43:08 Yup . Obama embraced Sharpton and Black lives matter. Chanted awful things about police. Trumps friends just rich and getting more rich like Martha Stewart. Sweet old men and women who trade stocks and cheat sometimes but don’t disrespect or want to kill any one
387 2018-08-08 20:42:09 Seeing a lot of stocks starting to reverse. Summer's coming to an end in a few weeks. Should start seeing fireworks happening very soon. I have my plays, do you?
388 2018-08-08 20:41:51 $ROKU beats. To the naysayers: it's not about the device, it's the channel and licensing agreements. #Roku has 22.0M active users vs. #Comcast's 22.3M. Roku WILL become the second largest cable TV provider very soon.

389 2018-08-08 20:41:11 Is it me or is the stock market and investors overreacting thereby overvaluing stocks on anything positive. It’s seems “balloonist” to me
390 2018-08-08 20:41:06 1. Don't you protect your wealth?
2. I have no privilege. I know socialists hate: but I earned what I have.
3. If it happens we will have much bigger problems in this country than a few stocks.
391 2018-08-08 20:40:58 You make a good point, yes the ending stocks number falls every year in the end. But in previous years it was falling to 300, 200. Little higher this year. I think it's too early to draw firm conclusions from the China conflict, let's see to what degree they return this fall.
392 2018-08-08 20:40:41 This jail br oke ama zon fi restick got all the hits on it. I had to break the words up so j eff be zos dont know im scamming the stocks i got off him 
393 2018-08-08 20:40:23 World stocks flat to lower: Europe -.2%; US flat. Earnings & China trade tension fought to a draw today in US. Strong 2Q earnings and likely strong 3Q & 4Q ones would normally spike market. However, trade issues will lower impact & trade war could cause market to back off highs.
394 2018-08-08 20:40:09 This guy is the biggest fraud there is. Pumping stocks and then dumps on the losers following him.
395 2018-08-08 20:40:01 My unweighted avg of about 1000 of the most liquid US stocks made at least a 10 year high yesterday, based on 10 years of data. I tend to agree.

437 2018-08-08 20:26:37 I'm agreeing with you...for the third time. This is why I'm using the word, "all", in ALL caps. All fishing, commercial, rec, tribal, (fill in the blank) should be curtained until the stocks improve. Its pretty simple. All I am asking for is fairness and uniformity.

454 2018-08-08 20:20:56 I feel like the biggest debates will be on legality of smash meter and decidin stage legality. So far 3 stocks and stage morph off seem incredibly likely. Thoughts on how stage legality should be done if there are 30, 40, 50 good stages after hazards are off?
455 2018-08-08 20:20:31 A lot of final smashes tho are essentially unlockable instant kills. 

Adding more stocks isn't such an easy solution. We just need to test it out and see how it feels, like we did with customs.

510 2018-08-08 19:54:39 this isn't melee or smash 64 we don't need more stocks lol. i'm waiting and seeing personally but entirely because of the "final smashes are weaker when powered with meter" thing. folks are jumping to conclusions but at this point i don't blame them
511 2018-08-08 19:53:36 I can't own any individual tech stocks.
512 2018-08-08 19:53:10 "FS Meter shouldn't be legal, it kills too early"

Just add more stocks
513 2018-08-08 19:53:10 LEGAL FINAL SMASHES WITH 4 STOCKS OR RIOT
514 2018-08-08 19:52:17 With all due respect, that is simply not true.  While you are correct, the indexes are indeed noise for the individual stock trader. But, there is not a single "roaring" bull in U.S. history that "many" stocks were in a bear market at the same time.
515 2018-08-08 19:52:07 SEC just made a formal inquiry...quite interesting considering it’s one of the most shorted stocks today..

518 2018-08-08 19:51:44 problem is though it is often mixed with heavy crude even in Asia, otherwise is a ballache. does look like though there will big overhang by Dec of light stuff, esp with mogas stocks globally high & Iran+Ven crude supplies down. Feels like total market tighter but light looser Q4

533 2018-08-08 19:45:25 Depends on the job.  Wages have, in part, stagnated so companies can still afford to help employees pay for health insurance premiums which skyrocketed due to Obamacare.  In part the same reasons stocks did well. Companies sat on cash, which shoots stock prices up.
534 2018-08-08 19:45:22 People think final smashes will be broken in a game where you can control the amount of stocks LOL

Like, it can't be broken
535 2018-08-08 19:45:19 I like everything but the 2 stock idea. 3 stocks is where it's at for me.
536 2018-08-08 19:44:30 I’m adding a few more small limit-buys at different prices, under the BID, for support  at $HMNY

547 2018-08-08 19:40:01 There's a reason stocks tend to slump in the early fall - rich folks sell stock to pay their kids' private school tuition ;-)

573 2018-08-08 19:25:32 Seeing some great stocks on sale these days. Snap isn't one of them, they have transformed to a wait and see stock. Holding shares tight through this rollercoaster.
574 2018-08-08 19:25:26 Congressman and woman shouldn’t be allowed to invest in stocks that they are privy too. It creates an unfair atmosphere and avoids elected officials getting rich when they are in office.

648 2018-08-08 18:58:22 11 sells?  There are, like 20 sell ratings total, on all followed stocks across all of Wall Street. I am purposely exaggerating but don’t get know how much.
649 2018-08-08 18:58:15 honestly all things aside i think elon calling for going private was a super move, lots of people shorting stocks hoping the value goes down n they can cash in  but this essentially FORCES them to re-buy lol, price is going *up* to 420, never down again, get owned stockies

670 2018-08-08 18:50:12 1 of my professors in graduate school said that 8-9 investments is plenty to offer sufficient diversification in an investment portfolio. But he was talking about stocks. Then I see BTC maximalists and people with 100 alts. You think this (8-9 investments) holds true for crypto?

672 2018-08-08 18:49:40 I think her argument is flawed.  Or course $TESLA could do X.  But what is the risk/reward?  There are much better risk/reward stocks out there.  The job of an investment manager is to find them. The job isn't to say "this company will win against the odds" i.e. fantasy thinking.
673 2018-08-08 18:49:39 And just a note, insider should ONLY apply to government officials, since they can use FORCE to benefit one company/industry over another.
I'm also fine with restricting politicians from owning ANY stocks while they are in office. Maybe that would entice them to leave. Bonus.
674 2018-08-08 18:49:19 .@USRepLong you have gambled with the Lives and safety of our citizens. You have become rich off of cheating with pharmaceutical stocks while Missourians can’t afford their medicine. You are what’s wrong with the system. Time for you to go.

681 2018-08-08 18:45:07 It’s one thing if you just happened to decide to sell your stocks not knowing things are going to change. But it doesn’t seem like coincidence with a lot of these people in power. I guess crime does pay.

694 2018-08-08 18:40:11 ETF stands for “exchange-traded fund” and describes a kind of investment fund where the price of assets like gold, stocks and oil can be tracked. These assets can then be traded on exchanges, just like conventional stocks. What this means is that investors have the option of…
695 2018-08-08 18:40:01 The problem with rage is that it _isn't_ strictly a catchup mechanic, it's often an accidental snowball mechanic. Particularly in Smash 4 which was played with 2 stocks, it gives a severe advantage to the person who takes the first stock.
696 2018-08-08 18:39:38 @RWPUSA I think you distinctly called this about congress having stocks in medical. Hope you win your seat!
697 2018-08-08 18:39:25 Seriously, you are conflating two uses of the word public.  In the sources you linked, private v public has to do with stocks being privately owned v traded publicly.  Facebook is publicly traded but is still an entity in the private sector.  Facebook is not “public” re: 1A.
698 2018-08-08 18:39:05 @LouisThomasYT Many cryptocurrency investors thought that selling altcoins and buying bitcoin was a value investment move. Instead they should have sold crypto and bough gold/stocks. That would have been converting nothing to something. Now they just converted nothing to nothing.

700 2018-08-08 18:37:35 This was one of the stocks that Tom Price was busy with.  I wrote my Senators about Price’s trading practices.  They voted yes anyway.
701 2018-08-08 18:37:22 So, i think markets are rational on these stocks. Its very hard to value them considering lots of uncertainty in the future cash flow.

735 2018-08-08 18:24:03 Not to double post, but "going public", "public company", and similar statements like the one's in @Millie__Weaver original post refer to becoming or being a "publicly traded company", where stocks are available for purchase to the general public

743 2018-08-08 18:21:47 Jacob I am not actually sure you are qualified to speak out about responsibility.  Particularly in the area that of stocks.
744 2018-08-08 18:21:47 What I really don’t get is Chris Collins has a 66 million $ net worth. The loss was less than a million. Why would you not just say I’ll make you and others whole. Let it go. People loose money on stocks it’s the chance you take.

773 2018-08-08 18:12:16 It would be awesome if it was legal. But final smashes almost always mean a stock is lost so they might have to increase the number of stocks if its implemented.

780 2018-08-08 18:09:21 Lol I bought Crypto earlier, since it was very low. But most of my investments will still be in stocks. Apple Is a great long term stock. But I also like to invest in companies that have potential to grow bigger like Apple.
781 2018-08-08 18:09:11 So buy some stocks and invest your money
782 2018-08-08 18:08:19 Saan to? stocks?
783 2018-08-08 18:08:15 Anyway, Chris Collins opponent should release a comprehensive ethics/campaign reform package that bans members of Congress from trading individual stocks and calls for broad money-in-politics reforms tied to Collins' comments about the tax bill and donors.

785 2018-08-08 18:07:56 Here’s some free advice for all the fantasy football people out there. Don’t draft Brett Favre this year a little birdy told me he doesn’t play anymore which is great for Wrangler jeans and Copper Fit. Invest in those companies stocks with a man like that endorsing them.
786 2018-08-08 18:06:54 We have a fab range of party accessories available.  Everything from 20 % off and hire costumes up to 50% off.  While stocks last.

788 2018-08-08 18:06:19 @traciemac_Bmore just posted about (R-TX) Mike Conaway!!!!

Time to buy stocks in EVERWhite, whiteboard manufacturer.  

Charting is essential.
789 2018-08-08 18:06:02 Thanks for sharing your advice on these stocks. It's really helpful for those of us who are still learning. I think @dbag_pickz is upset because he probably has a stake in 1 or more of those. Also, I think his screen name tells us all we need to know about him. LMAO
790 2018-08-08 18:05:34 i will have to check this out mike.  they delisted draught brown about 8 weeks ago. i was lucky enough to buy 55 kegs in its last couple of weeks. We only have it as long as our stocks last.  i reckon a couple of weeks and we will be dry.
791 2018-08-08 18:05:27 @BearUNLV I was watching Nairo’s stream and they were talking about a rule set were players played a 3v3 with different characters per stock instead of one character 3 stocks each. What’s the possibility of this happening?
792 2018-08-08 18:04:20 If they include final smashes competitively then they would have to increase the number of stocks because a final smash is a instant stock loss.
793 2018-08-08 18:04:08 Surterra isn’t public. Which ones in Usa do you like. I have stocks in Canadian ones due to the recent legalization.

797 2018-08-08 18:02:59 It's an app. I'll DM you a link. If you sign up using that, it'll give you a free stock in some random thing lol. Then you just add funds and buy stocks. You can only buy whole stocks.
798 2018-08-08 18:02:45 Only the men involved with @RepChrisCollins have been arrested. Why was the fiance and her mother not arrested? They dumped stocks too and were discussed at the presser.

802 2018-08-08 18:01:11 I think it looks good. I’m also a sucker for laminate stocks.
803 2018-08-08 18:01:10 yes kevin, we beleive that we are the last in the country to stock this glorious brew. unfortunately Its only while stocks last as it was delisted a few weeks ago. pop your head in.  i might even treat you to one.
804 2018-08-08 18:00:34 Much rather invest in living organisations with people taking risks and building things than land. Stocks and bonds. And when you want to sell you can do it in 2 clicks.

806 2018-08-08 17:59:57 When a company goes public, they have a new found responsibility to share holders. Right now, they are tanking their stocks in spite of the share holders rather than doing what's necessary to raise the stock.
807 2018-08-08 17:58:45 Big reason for not reading financial journalists, no skin in the game. Buy 15 stocks and disclose your position
808 2018-08-08 17:58:35 $kss $m I  was thinking  about quantifying the impact of the stock price of the unwinding of $M $Kss shorts. Short stocks have decreased by one third with the stock price running up 100%. If $M $kss blows out earnings  another decrease of a third of shorts and another  stock rise
809 2018-08-08 17:57:33 Privately own companies, whether in whole or by stocks are still private companies. Public utilities and services means that the government has a say in how they are run and in as such, the "public" has a say, because we vote on representatives who run the government.

814 2018-08-08 17:55:57 We’ve been burned a few times by holding individual stocks — WaMu (I originally owned Great Western Bank following Peter Lynch’s “buy what you know” advice), Enron (I followed the bubble crowd) and United Airlines (wife’s stock options). All went splat!! We index now .
815 2018-08-08 17:55:36 MORE CHEAPER $HMNY #STOCK ?

 Yes, please!!

 Bears love  to use cheap stock prices to try and scare #investors away. 
816 2018-08-08 17:54:49 I think if chargeable final smash is to be legal, then we should have 4 stocks instead of three. Then again, won’t know until we play around with it.
817 2018-08-08 17:54:29 Don’t forget @RepMullin, he bought these stocks as well.

820 2018-08-08 17:52:50 I don't want to take away your guns. But I don't want them used to shoot children either. Gun control is not disarmament.  I support the right to bear arms. That doesn't mean bump stocks are ok
821 2018-08-08 17:52:45 Anyone into stocks? I know there’s stock apps out there... tell me more. Hook me up.
822 2018-08-08 17:52:43 Bla bla bla, I have been hearing this crap from you since 2012 or something. Stocks are being manipulated aswell. What isn’t? Americans live in an illusion.
823 2018-08-08 17:50:57 Buy US refinery stocks and short Canadian oil sand stocks would be an ideal paired trade.
824 2018-08-08 17:50:27 The fact that Wrigley is moving away from investing into gum and now going to medical marijuana should be the nail in the coffin. If you have yet to invest in marinuana stocks you're missing the opportunity to be rich 10-15 years from now.
825 2018-08-08 17:49:35 Last heard that SEBI blindfolds one of their officers and asks him to throw darts at the board. That is how stocks come in and out of ASM!
826 2018-08-08 17:49:17 .@elonmusk is one of my heroes. The way the thugs that run Wall Street freaked out yesterday because of his one tweet brought me so much joy. The morons who think they're geniuses because central bankers buy stocks need to learn more.
827 2018-08-08 17:48:51 Crowdfunding can create money infinitly, but not metal, lithium and ressources from a magic black hole. China has the lead on ressources Elon needs for his business and there is not as much stocks for his plans as he want. You should ask the good questions to yourself ;)

3. Stable Govt. With a Charasmatic leader

Why we don't deserve a premium

837 2018-08-08 17:44:35 Happy to help
838 2018-08-08 17:44:25 The easiest thing for people to do if they have stocks is sell them. A company that allows someone to attack the parents of mass shooting tell them their children never existed. Why financially support a company that allows that. Its their responsibility to fix it not journalists

861 2018-08-08 17:35:47 Una cosa veo clara y es que si utilizamos la barra entonces 2 stocks quedarían completamente fuera de discusión, e incluso diría que los 3 stocks también. Lo dicho, a ver como encaja eso. Cualquier mecánica nueva es bienvenida
862 2018-08-08 17:35:33 (2). Even if policy response not inflationary it does well “relatively” see Great Depression 1929-1935. Gold stocks zoomed. Gold outlawed. All other prices down. In deflation debts implode, prices collapse, everyone bankrupt. Gold cannot go BK. It stores value.
863 2018-08-08 17:35:31 As with Trump's tariffs, the Exec and Leg Branches can in fact control the directions of many stocks, giving them insight to what to buy and when to buy, what to sell and what to sell.  Yet they want oversight and control of our bodies when they don't look at these 2 bodies.
864 2018-08-08 17:34:21 4 stock Smash Ultimate. The first couple stocks seem almost slow

867 2018-08-08 17:33:52 my take on the final smash charges + competitive 

> they're completely dodgeable/missable 
> it's weaker probably for this purpose (probably kills at a far higher %) 
> 5mash seems like it's supposed to be played with 3+ stocks 

I hope tournaments try it

872 2018-08-08 17:32:25 Maybe members of Congress should be forced to sell ALL their stocks prior to taking office & they, along with members of their immediate family, couldn't purchase stocks the entire time they're in office. Might reduce income of some in Congress who "suddenly" become millionaires

My analysis following the June 30 QS report, using 5-yr and 10-yr average (% of total) demand for Q4 resulted in a 17-18 corn ending stocks projection of 2.450 bb. USDA is at 2.027 bb. My bean proj. = 700 mb, vs. USDA's 465 mb.
892 2018-08-08 17:25:54 I'm not a liberal.  Facebook is a privately owned business. Having their stocks available to the public doesn't change that. Now the stockholders could force a vote as to whether or not to ban Jones, but the government has no place in making the decision.
893 2018-08-08 17:25:41 Im fully aware since I work in finance. But he never once mentioned equities he talked about compound interest which is savings/checking/fixed income not compound returns which equates to stocks/mutual funds. One of the players also said leaving $100k in the bank so who knows

895 2018-08-08 17:24:56 Trading curbs (circuit breakers) are for the full market and occur at 7%, 13% and 20%. For specific stocks you’ll see trading halts for a variety of reasons (e.g. Tesla yesterday) due to order imbalances or questions about a companies financials. None of those apply to UVXY.

900 2018-08-08 17:24:14 Big up move in $CGC today which is the largest cap marijuana company. Market value back above $6B after a month of July where the stock looked broken. This space is interesting especially with Canada’s beginning of legalized weed beginning in October. These stocks very pricey
901 2018-08-08 17:23:03 I'm confused though because I thought it is less risky to trade a dark company than to trade a delinquent company. And lots of stocks are dark.

903 2018-08-08 17:22:57 too early to tell but I can see it happening. All smashes are now fast and similarly strong, and if it goes back to 4 stocks then dying to a final smash isnt that big of a deal

910 2018-08-08 17:19:38 It all depends on how companies use the tax savings. If they decide to save the $, buyback stocks, or disperse higher dividends, there won't be much growth. Higher taxes could be used to finance an expanded EITC which would drive growth.

933 2018-08-08 17:08:54 I know you're better than this at arguments. Jussayin. 

Stocks/shares are ownership of a company, going public is just opening those up for trade with whomever wants them. The ownership of the company is still in the shareholders then.

959 2018-08-08 16:57:17 How about an app that tells us when to dump our stocks before information affecting price changes goes public. You know, like Rep. Chris Collins was just arrested for doing. Like you did with your Juno Therapeutics and Celgene stocks back in 2016.

961 2018-08-08 16:56:42 Understandable point, but then it all comes down to how each final smash plays and how it does with damage. Besides, I don't think we know if meter stays through stocks.

969 2018-08-08 16:54:06 You cannot be serious. This man called his son immediately upon hearing of a failed drug, the son called his future father-in-law and they both sold their stocks before it tumbled down 92%. NINETY TWO PERCENT! Then all 3 of them lied to the FBI.
Give it a rest-this is criminal.

972 2018-08-08 16:52:00 Awesome video evidence to correspond w/prosecutors' timeline of Collins calling his son to dump stocks.
973 2018-08-08 16:51:02 “BBG - Gross’ bond fund assets fall to lowest since November 2014”....-7% returns....that’s ridiculous -7% for a bond fund but when you put stocks into your ‘bond fund’ that’s what happens

990 2018-08-08 16:48:22 By that standard you'd need to indict half the people who trade the pink sheets. True or not, penny stocks are literally sold on tips: "Can't go into details, but I have an extreeemely good contact who ..."

Now they can, along with real estate, stocks, cruises, and more they couldn't afford back then. Financial maturity, impossible without the Federal Reserve, was a major contributing factor.
996 2018-08-08 16:47:12 pat exp was 850. Revenues missed. No dividend declared. Sales volumes declining. Stock up 10% in 4 days. Get ready for fall

What about the potential for more stocks.
Potential for comebacks. 

I say try changing the rules for it before denying it. #SmashUltimate

1036 2018-08-08 16:34:42 Collins is from my area! I’ve always been suspect of him and his businesses. This goes back before he endorsed President Trump. He was always a tad bit sketchy when it came to his own personal business . This is “ insider trading “ he dumped his own stocks !

1048 2018-08-08 16:32:10 yea...and perhaps, limiting the fishing by the Tribes. If only until the stocks can rebound. Does this ever happen? #Truth
1049 2018-08-08 16:32:09 @CzarVT the bse healthcare index gives us a better picture of pharma stocks than nifty pharma , many stocks in that index already at life time new highs

1059 2018-08-08 16:28:37 The best Smash Bros Ultimate players will be able to do good in any ruleset. It doesn’t matter how many stocks/timer/stage list/final smash meter???/etc.

My point is making a universal ruleset is nearly impossible.
1060 2018-08-08 16:28:33 Could Collins also be liable to shareholders because his actions as a board member diluted the value of their stocks?
1061 2018-08-08 16:28:18 Thanks. I'd say that small stocks have fewer people looking at them, but since they have smaller market caps, they also need fewer informed investors to keep price in line with fundamentals. 

And many HFs skew toward smaller stocks, which IMO has made the space more efficient.
1062 2018-08-08 16:27:58 BASHERS ARE OUT HOT & HEAVY TRYING TO SCARE INVESTORS!

These scared bashing bears make me even more bullish 
1063 2018-08-08 16:27:49 WHY FLASH SALE HONOR..WE HATE IT...PLS MAKE 6 GB STOCKS AVAILABLE IN PLENTY
1064 2018-08-08 16:26:59 My stocks are tanking because of Trump while his buddies are committing insider trading.  #VoteTheBumsOut!
1065 2018-08-08 16:26:56 - 9 stages

- Both players choose a stage and then turn on stage morph and choose both player's stages. But only for the first round

- Try out Final Smashes when the game first comes out to just get it out the way and see if it works

- 3 stocks
1066 2018-08-08 16:26:52 Would be nice to see Trump’s tax returns.  How much does he have in steel and aluminum stocks?
1067 2018-08-08 16:26:49 Me either I have like nothing in my bank account. All my money is in stocks. Debt free is freedom tho and that imo is the richest thing you can have.
1068 2018-08-08 16:26:02 My local Wal-Mart of all places stocks your product for the best price around bar far. Sadly they only have 5-6 flavors available and always the same ones. I has got to find a local grocer who has more variety! Like this one!
1069 2018-08-08 16:25:34 Waiting to hear how many other Republicans in Congress will also be indicted for selling their stocks upon hearing from Rep. COLLINS including members of Trump's family and administration   
The letters  GOP stand for
Greed

1070 2018-08-08 16:25:19 I have like 2k in my bank accnt don’t let my stocks fool you. I’m broke. 
1071 2018-08-08 16:25:04 @KennedyNation @jimmyfailla here is a possible stupid question. How do other countries Europe, China, lol Russia, and Arab nations deal with insider trading? Martha Stewart made Christmas in jail.  Idk.  These people are selling bad stocks.  Ripping people off. Idk if you know
1072 2018-08-08 16:25:01 Many cannabis stocks are traded on markets outside of the USA (like Canada)
1073 2018-08-08 16:24:30 Me too... im not saying i have mad bread bc in far from that, but im debt free ,so i think that makes me rich. Lolll i dont have any stocks pmo
1074 2018-08-08 16:23:59 haha I remember that "secret" broker mess my mind long time ago... I want to "discover" what broker was that... the GOOD one, the one for the rich people... lol
1075 2018-08-08 16:23:52 I've managed money for several public officials, and insiders..  you just don't buy individual stocks for these guys...  all ETF's   Keeps everyone out of jail....
1076 2018-08-08 16:23:14 I believe one time last winter when stocks were low. 
Now dream some sweet dreams about anything about pigeon pie. 'She closed her eyes and drifted off to slep
1077 2018-08-08 16:23:12 I suppose Potus will tweet Collins is a good man and was illegally tapped and doesn't deserve to be treated that way, whichever way he specifies.I know Potus affected stocks when he released a good response before the employment numbers were to be released. June? Bad.
1078 2018-08-08 16:23:06 I’m super excited for smash ultimate but I dread watching the community try to agree on a consistent rule set. 103 stages, hazard switch, number of stocks, timer, the miis, metered final smashes, and potentially a rage switch. It’s too much man
1079 2018-08-08 16:23:04 @SDNYnews @RepChrisCollins @FoxNews If theyre so Corrupt why didnt Rep Collins Sell Short? Couldnt he Have Made Millions? I Hope These People Go After All incl. Democrats who Do this All the Time. Politicians get Many Tips on Stocks. I Hope Same Treatment  For All- NY AG a Dem?
1080 2018-08-08 16:22:29 He won’t even let the members who actually DO the work buy stocks in the company.
1081 2018-08-08 16:21:51 His Fiancée father. I wonder why not her? They said she also sold stocks.
1082 2018-08-08 16:21:32 So let me get this right. When a (R) Congressman gets inside information on stocks, the world comes to an end. But I remember a few years ago Nancy Pelosi making millions upon millions on an insider trader tip and the SWAMP said it was perfectly legal. Then it was crickets! Hmmm
1083 2018-08-08 16:21:31 Its a "secret"broker. shhh....
1084 2018-08-08 16:21:26 Watching this Chris Collins pressor by the U.S. Atty, all I can think is, "They made Jimmy Carter sell his peanut farm."

Congresspeople should be required to divest from all stocks before being sworn into office. Public service should include some level of sacrifice.
1085 2018-08-08 16:21:13 So let me get this right. When a (R) Congressman gets inside information on stocks, the world comes to an end.

1086 2018-08-08 16:21:03 Cannon’s Tip of the day: Don’t ever honk you don’t have enough money to invest in stocks. Do it, ASAP. I wish I would’ve started once I started making my own income.
1087 2018-08-08 16:20:42 super-models are overrated!  Find a girl who's a regular rain man when it comes to picking stocks.  If we'd both jumped on NFLX we'd be good

1092 2018-08-08 16:18:38 There should be a law, if you hold public office you cannot trade stocks or sit on boards. @RepChrisCollins must resign.

1094 2018-08-08 16:18:17 4/ *caveat: analysts aren't allowed to hold stocks they cover (or options thereof) in their virtual accounts, so it does remain superficially ok by SEC standards; however, IR @ covered stocks know how these incentives work, and sometimes feed info on other names to analysts...
1095 2018-08-08 16:17:52 I think $GMGI should be taken more seriously due to...
1. Their #growthrate
2. Consistent increase in #Revenue streams 
3. Closely approaching #profitability 

All since becoming active in April 2018.

1099 2018-08-08 16:17:06 in what world would you not tell you son about a failed trial you were both invested in? you buy stocks by tips and if you lose money.. feds dont make you take money to replace loss .. this is a stupid law .. how did any selling off stock hurt others?
1100 2018-08-08 16:16:23 Well if you look at the last decade then SA stocks (and EM broadly) have performed very badly in US$ mainly due to currency depreciation. Will share a chart that shows how poor the returns have been. Going forward, it will worsen due to lower investments in intangibles
1101 2018-08-08 16:16:18 I consider investing in #shiplicables one of the biggest blunders I did as a novice investor in 2014. No due diligence and only based on low P/E it was a disastrous approach. The funny part is it was of my best return generator at around 3X (sold in 2016) #Markets #stocks
1102 2018-08-08 16:16:12 All the fraud folks and Criminals under Trump flock together to scam us American folks  Banks  Trade stocks Military  and Government  to make money pay for play Trumps seat as President was made by the  cGnsters crime people to scam America and Americans
1103 2018-08-08 16:16:07 The top five stocks higher at noon today are $KORS. $ALB, $CVS, $BSX, and $AES.
1104 2018-08-08 16:16:04 Oh now you do that.  Should also pass a rule that makes all politicians divests of individual stocks and only purchase index funds.  They would truly be invested in the health of the economy this way.  That would alleviate this whole issue.
1105 2018-08-08 16:16:01 Didn’t Pelosi say “ I did not know that we could not buy stocks based on info obtained  from house legislation “ or something like that when finally the house prohibited insider trading a few years ago ...??

1111 2018-08-08 16:14:29 I think like stocks...?
1112 2018-08-08 16:14:14 @BMTheEquityDesk Dear Basant sir, 
Mr @porinju tweeted today "Forget the 'caps', size doesn't matter. Look for the hidden gems among  the 1001 investible quality stocks -than chasing highest quality  companies  at 60/70 PEx" .This is contrast to ur investing style...ur thoughts?
1113 2018-08-08 16:13:59 Since he supports "democracy", if a simple majority of people vote for him to be put in stocks and pelted with rotting vegetables for a month for being a authoritarian ass-clown he should have no objections right?
1114 2018-08-08 16:13:23 Just watching stocks fall....sell while you can
1115 2018-08-08 16:13:20 Over here buyin useless shit like stocks n cryptos I shoulda copped some Jordan’s

1117 2018-08-08 16:12:59 Why are any members of Congress allowed to sit on any board or trade any stocks while in office?
1118 2018-08-08 16:12:56 Either the US govt prints money to prevent default, or the US govt prints money to prevent default.

Politicians won’t allow a depression.

Own stocks bc u can’t time when it all falls apart. 

Own bitcoin for when it all falls apart.
1119 2018-08-08 16:12:53 Ok, this is a new one for me. Argus is now using PEGY to argue for Value stocks
1120 2018-08-08 16:12:41 Collins selling shares to avoid a loss of a few hundred thousand is bad but let's not forget only a few months ago when Carl Icahn sold off $31.3 million in stocks he owned in a steel-dependent company, just days before Trump announced tariffs and it was a blip on the radar
1121 2018-08-08 16:11:42 Collins was already under investigation so he had his son and fiancee sell their stocks before the stock plummeted. The audacity.
1122 2018-08-08 16:10:20 Might go under 5 today

1127 2018-08-08 16:09:02 I think the smash bar is a great idea, and i figured smash 4 would of had it after brawl, i think it could be great for tournament play has long has the bar dont charge too fast, like maybe only once every 2 stocks or something.

1130 2018-08-08 16:07:28 @TurtleBeach fucking amatuers...this is why you dont scare investors with shelf offerings...you broke the stocks momentum and now with all the shorts all over stock it will be hard to get momentum back even with great numbers/growth...rookies
1131 2018-08-08 16:07:15 hmmm, well whether TSLA will succeed in the long run is one thing, whether or not I could live with myself profiting off loss and despair is another. Personally, I choose not to short stocks.  I manage to make bits of profits without ganging up on a stock to take it down
1132 2018-08-08 16:06:53 Stop letting members of Congress trade individual stocks.
1133 2018-08-08 16:06:18 In trump regime, safe to say 9 out of 10 GOP are involved in blatantly committing crimes (bribes/stocks/sex/treason) bc they believe there will be NO consequences OR trump will pardon them! Just a little digging will find a lot of dirt-money/fraud/affairs/pedophiles/Russians.
1134 2018-08-08 16:06:15 I've only ever traded forex and crypto

Thank you for the wisdom my prehistoric friend
1135 2018-08-08 16:06:11 Twice is more successful than got7 or any JYPE group for that matter and thats what JYP give them frequent comebacks because they know that they make more money from twice comebacks and that's why JYP stocks increase when twice comeback it's a fact

1144 2018-08-08 16:03:41 Uh oh! Former HHS Secretary Tom Price invested in the stocks that Chris Collins had inside information about. Looks like these crooked dominos are about to fall.
1145 2018-08-08 16:03:36 Looks like all the People around Trump are all Criminals who are socreedy to defraud the Banksthe Government  and Stocks Trading the are all there to make  Money any way the can to cheat us all  the are not for the American People looking out for but themselves no drain the swamp
1146 2018-08-08 16:03:33 STOCKS TO WATCH: Shorts were seen being built in stocks like IDFC Bank, NMDC, Lupin, SAIL, L&TFH, REC, Arvind, Vedanta, Aurobindo Pharma, ITC, HPCL, Tata Power, Infosys and TVS Motors.
1147 2018-08-08 16:03:26 Just 7 of 33 stocks I broadly follow on my screen are green today. The ping-pong action (for growth anyway) continues.
1148 2018-08-08 16:02:14 3 stocks is the way thats why 
1149 2018-08-08 16:01:57 Lol! yeah those large market cap stocks don't move an inch.
1150 2018-08-08 16:01:44 Pls add results estimates of nifty stocks to your "All you need to know before going in to the trade" article..it will be of great use for those who can read results ASAP...thanks.
1151 2018-08-08 16:01:42 Or go private, do some sketchy innovation and go public again when the stocks multiple times its worth, avoiding speculation during the innovation process so as to not discourage shareholders
1152 2018-08-08 16:01:15 LOL so you're saying you had the sheer nerve and guts to short it today? Good Lord, why not just buy stocks in the hope they do well? And forget the catastrophic short plays?  This can't end well!!
1153 2018-08-08 16:00:25 Every member of the U.S. Congress was exempt from insider trading laws until a couple of years ago. They amassed great fortunes trading stocks they themselves regulated. Now the FBI suddenly becomes concerned about a Republican congressman up for election? Payback! Corrupt FBI!

1166 2018-08-08 15:55:10 Difficult part comes in assuming that because US is doing so well and SA so poor that you should stick to that assumption. Maybe SA stocks are wildly undervalued and due a massive brazil like run.?. Either way this is why long-term portfolios should be measured in decades.

1174 2018-08-08 15:53:18 I’m on the fence about chargeable final smashes being legal. Some I think are fine; but shit like Super Sonic and the Zero Laser are really strong. I guess depending on how often they happen and how many stocks we have might make them okay.
1175 2018-08-08 15:52:58 @jposhaughnessy :The price-to-sales ratio is the most consistent value ratio to use for buying market-beating stocks.

1178 2018-08-08 15:51:12 Thats exactly what i like about it. Maybe raging demon grabs one person and takes two stocks?
1179 2018-08-08 15:50:18 Millie, “publicly traded” means that their stocks are traded on the stock market. Anyone can buy a share of stock.
“Privately owned” means they’re not a government entity.
Publicly traded businesses are privately owned. The government isn’t traded on the stock market.
1180 2018-08-08 15:49:37 Really gotta stay off the Vans website when I have no money. The new stocks in and I added £200 worth of stuff to my basket and now I’m really sad bc I can’t buy any of it
1181 2018-08-08 15:49:34 I don't own TSLA but also not stupid enough to short it. I sit on the sidelines when a capable visionary is on a mission because those stocks trade at a multiple of concept..and he has an active imagination.
1182 2018-08-08 15:49:29 We have stocks tho.
1183 2018-08-08 15:49:18 Best advice. Understand what you bought. Bitcoin is a hedge against  govt monetary systems and a bid to be future gold. Nothing has changed. Day to day price is noise. 

I own stocks and bitcoin.  I win either way.

1193 2018-08-08 15:47:48 Try to diversify more Steven, 2-3 stocks making up 50% of your portfolio is too high of a risk imo. Specially when they trade similarly. Try to make your investments in a single stock around 10-15% and never more than 25% of your portofolio in a single industry

1201 2018-08-08 15:45:47 If we use the chargeable final smash meter does that mean we can go back to 4 stocks?!?
1202 2018-08-08 15:45:45 The "good" thing about #cryptos is that they provide a modern instantiation of the stock trading world we can only read about in "#ReminiscencesofaStockOperator" where manipulation - pump & dump schemes, etc. - of worthless stocks was a legitimate way to play the game back then.
1203 2018-08-08 15:45:26 Here's a mind game to play.

HRC has 4.1 GDP growth.
Stocks at all time highs since HRC election.
HRC negotiations result in Peace in N Korea

1205 2018-08-08 15:45:19 This would save us from what happened at EVO. People gonna keep complaining about Bayo. Even when she's nerfed, just giving her something over everyone else is bad. Also, Marcina still kills at 0. Give Marth to someone like MK Leo and he'll be taking stocks free.

1210 2018-08-08 15:44:44 The characters I was looking for weren’t announced, but it was great regardless. Chrome looks like an awesome mix of Roy and Ike, being able to use other characters as stocks is great. And Marshadow is a pokeball

1301 2018-08-08 15:13:46 Congrats for Equity Intelligence posting profit of 3.7% in July with low PE stocks, unfortunately it’s still poor among PMS. Basant Maheshwari has posted breathtaking 16% profit with his 60 PE stocks.
1302 2018-08-08 15:13:42 WAYFARER COOPERATIVE stocks climb despite troubling geopolitical headlines
1303 2018-08-08 15:13:02 Why is Musk taking so much heat for telling the world he wants to take $TSLA private? Fund managers move stocks all the time when they mention thier positions. I remember years ago when the $TOL CEO roasted the shorts with his comments. I was hit hard, but thats the business.

1312 2018-08-08 15:11:17 What happens to GDP growth if midterm elections do not go well? More importantly to stocks? I suspect mother market may soon start to fret over this.
1313 2018-08-08 15:10:56 Exactly. I’d rather invest my money in stocks that’s a way better chance tbh. Once they told me I had to pay $200 something for a class on it and then if I don’t refer two people I’d pay that every month I was like hell nah.

1317 2018-08-08 15:09:36 Trump was also informed to dump said stocks.  You know they know.
1318 2018-08-08 15:08:48 Well, it wouldn't be arbitrary. You'd know what it would mean to have "recouped enough". Could be 10x initial cost, could be 100x, could be when become publically traded and issue stocks

People would decide if it's worth it. Why does recompense have to be eternal and hereditary?

1323 2018-08-08 15:07:28 Some of the stocks in my radar : $ZUO $NTNX $YEXT $PVTL and if $BILI ( that it already was my worse pick this year so far -28%) presenta bad ER I would be a buyer at around 7-8$. I think it’s a story of growth for longer term with noise of the ban in short term .
1324 2018-08-08 15:07:20 If the Final Smash meter or game changes accelerate it enough, maybe 3 stocks.  Have to experiment. 

I'd also like to see something with the 3 characters mode instead of 3 stocks.  If a metaknight or bayo exists in the game, at least it would only be one of your stocks.

1330 2018-08-08 15:05:33 Watching @RepChrisCollins lie his butt off on CNN with Wolf Blitzer about NEVER having done ANYTHING illegal about notifying his son so that he could DUMP his stocks and not suffer a loss. He’s another Trump- like LIAR. Vote him out!!
1331 2018-08-08 15:05:07 Try this one:

No stages banned, hazards set to off. Final Smash meter turned on.
1st stage is random.
2 stocks
3 out of 5 games.
Loser can choose the next stage OR change character, not both. If the stage is not changed, you continue using the same stage.

1333 2018-08-08 15:04:43 Stock market has averaged 9-10% over the last 100 years, before inflation. Stock market was up 20% last year. Stocks, that's where. Yeah there are terrible years, but it's always bounced back.

1336 2018-08-08 15:03:11 We desperately need more of this “cleansing” in state legislatures, House, Senate, and Trump administration. Profiting from trading stocks in companies they can influence via legislation is an ethical no-no, and yet many legislators blithely treat it as the road to riches.

1345 2018-08-08 14:59:43 Last I checked FB, Apple & YouTube/Google are not private!  Stocks traded on open trade forums. Why censoring Alex Jones & not those promoting child marriage & killings, radical muslim hate crimes, & all other criminal speech that is truly filled with hate & harm our people.

1347 2018-08-08 14:58:47 Exactly! Once elected to office they should sell all stocks and properties. It's fantasy to think one would make policy that goes against their best interest. All potential conflicts of interest should be eliminated.

1349 2018-08-08 14:58:24 fyi, regarding $IQ, very very speculative BUT current 5MA on monthly is 29.50s and 10MA is 30.70s. if we see a support here and stock rises for 3rd day we may be looking at BIG Golden Cross in future.... watching

How is this not a standard problem of the dynamic consistency challenges of taxing existing capital stocks—when you’ve decided that you can live with the dynamic disincentives?

1352 2018-08-08 14:57:15 I'm hopeful that the option to turn off Stage Hazards will open people's minds up to trying more things out. But if people start this game with 2 stocks then they're just a bunch of stupid idiots lol
1353 2018-08-08 14:57:06 My kronos stocks  easy money ,
1354 2018-08-08 14:56:45 and for whatever reason i cant pull the trigger fast enough on $CVSI i missed buyng 2k shares at 2dollar break then i missed buying 1k shares at 3.33 dip.. i really cant wait for pot stocks to heat up again thats my bread and butter well multi-day breakouts on super hot sector!!
1355 2018-08-08 14:56:42 Facts.. I didn't learn any of this in school. They need to teach kids stocks, real estate and taxes in high school.
1356 2018-08-08 14:56:36 Yah he shared insider knowledge and conspired with his son who handled the stocks.
1357 2018-08-08 14:56:26 I've wanted a mode where each of your stocks is a different character so this direct made me very happy.
1358 2018-08-08 14:56:12 No Cambazola? Right, I'm ditching Tesco for Waitrose.

Seriously, though, I buy Scottish where there's a choice. Sainsbury's stocks Graham's products for example, if it's butter you need.
1359 2018-08-08 14:56:09 @elonmusk brilliant just brilliant, everyone wants what they can't have!! Way to drive stocks!
1360 2018-08-08 14:56:08 depends on how long it takes to charge up the final smash meter tbh. Fighting games have a single bar and ultimate is gonna be played with 3 stocks soo...
1361 2018-08-08 14:56:08 When they finally bottom buying around a 52w high is still usually lower than an averaged price (whether down or in) without the psychological damage and the missed opportunity of better stocks. I've traded and made money twice in this one
1362 2018-08-08 14:55:51 Just in time for the return of the Premier league, we have the half price NowTv box for only €22.50. This box includes one month Sky Sports, Sky Movies and Sky Entertainment pass. Available now, while stocks last.
1363 2018-08-08 14:55:07 PENNY STOCKS MOMO ALERT: $FLNT - FLUENT
1364 2018-08-08 14:55:04 Smash is played with 3 stocks, so in a way, a 1HKO is really only one third of your "lifebar" in a traditional fighting game, which is roughly what you'd get from a super anyways. Also, a few characters already have 1HKOs without supers. They're worth a try, imo.
1365 2018-08-08 14:54:57 Always easier to ignore my stocks when they're green! $WEED making it easy to be on vacation today. Hope it holds. Gotta think @savestacks is having a pretty good day!

Stage List

oof.
1367 2018-08-08 14:54:45 @CNN #repChrisCollins.... It should be noted this Innate stock Mr Collins is involved in is a penny stock... currently 23 cents a share or so..  very risky investment...
Vast majority of penny stocks end up worthless.. Insider trading??
It be a miracle if anyone made any money..
1368 2018-08-08 14:54:38 Also, with all these options, the competitive rule set for Ultimate is in shambles right now.

-Potentially many legal stages in the double digits
-Final Smash meter
-Stage Morphing

Hell, there’s stamina stocks now. So many potential side events, and room for experimentation.
1369 2018-08-08 14:54:32 #ast RNS @colhutch 
Its bad form when shareholders have to ask for market sensitive information that they know is out there

Tell us what happened at this meeting and what few details you will now be doing to get progress and SP rise?

This is your job not ours 
1370 2018-08-08 14:54:29 except final smashes despite being nerfed would likely still be taking stocks around 50% which is way stronger then a single super in practically any fighting game
1371 2018-08-08 14:54:28 The money of americans are in stocks, how can they liquidate it? Free health, school but no police, no military, no more money for infra... what will happen to america?
1372 2018-08-08 14:54:01 Thefunny part comes at the end; prayer for relief includes a lifetime bar against defendants trading penny stocks. Not equities or all securities...penny stocks in specific. There’s always some comedy in these SEC kangaroo civil claims, but that end distinction is just precious.

1375 2018-08-08 14:53:41 I getcha, the smash team goes through all this effort to make as many stages and modes good for tournaments, and then they're going to be like "hmmm, how about the five stages and stocks only?"
1376 2018-08-08 14:53:26 Instead what would happen is central products would increase in value and the fluff would be removed from the market, meaning cheaper essentials and more money in everyone’s pockets for side goals like business, stocks, and non essentials
1377 2018-08-08 14:53:24 Watching $FTK over next few days for hammer pop trade, nothing yet, what a slaughterhouse, has offered good trade action in past but down trend seems to be fueled by hedge fund hate which is a powerful force with smaller float POS stocks, they do have to cover though
1378 2018-08-08 14:53:05 It’s easy to get tunnel vision on a single security.  Scale out to wider time frames and the market as a whole.  This will re-affirm or rebuttal your outlook. #trading #stocks
1379 2018-08-08 14:52:59 @iofreddy85 unfortunately yes .. lesson learned .In fact I may not hold overnight at all  stocks in flight rather exit and come back

1384 2018-08-08 14:51:49 the most exciting thing to me is presence of a meter

if the game is really similar in weight and feel to smash 4 it could really help with closing out stocks not taking actual years

1390 2018-08-08 14:49:14 This feels like it'd be terrible for any volatile matchup. Losing most of your stocks before the first stage transition?

1397 2018-08-08 14:47:46 Congressmen should be forbiddent to own *any* stocks.  They should be limited to broad-based index funds/etfs (eg SPY, BND).  Anything else is simply corruption by another name.

1400 2018-08-08 14:46:17 Insider trading doesn't require the purchase or sale of stocks, right? Merely the communication of privileged information that would severely impact a stock purchase? Not sure the on exact wording, but that's kind of the gist of it, right?

1415 2018-08-08 14:42:06 if your worried about bump stocks, you have been fooled. they are a red-herring. anyone with 5 min of training can bump fire a gun with their finger. the bump stock is a gimmick that has been used in exactly "1" crime. AR-15's are not going anywhere, will never happen.

1426 2018-08-08 14:39:13 @rayray2565 it’s trend not a guess stocks that make new lows go lower.
1427 2018-08-08 14:38:55 Unacceptably early lol.

Unless it’s some exceptionally laggy/slow move, bad Di or an edge guard we don’t need stocks lost at 50 in this game
1428 2018-08-08 14:38:05 Tom Price should be arrested too!

Tom Price + cronies have betrayed public trust by steering or delaying legislation on health + drug policy while investing in health care stocks.

At my former Wall Street law firm, we couldn’t even buy stocks without a blind trust in place.
1429 2018-08-08 14:37:49 I wake early asf too coupon & check the stocks. I will be rich & plentiful very soon!
1430 2018-08-08 14:37:36 AND with the potential for $tesla to go private, we may have even less securities to choose from and thus more concentration.

1434 2018-08-08 14:36:30 Does small business optimism mean insider trading on pharmaceutical stocks ? How does a plumber from Muskogeee know to drop six figures on a tiny little company? You should answer these questions.
1435 2018-08-08 14:36:28 $TSLA My shares are locked in a cash only account awaiting $500 or @elonmusk to take me private, whichever comes first.

Til then, playing with other stocks
1436 2018-08-08 14:36:24 It’s Called orchestrating. Exactly the same thing happened after the 2000 nasdaq crash. Almost all individual investors sold their Apple, intel, Cisco, Dell, Microsoft etc stocks to smart wallstreet investors.... only to buy them back at 10x the original value..or more
1437 2018-08-08 14:36:04 So lets think about this. ABC News reported that Rep Senator Christopher Collins of NY gets indicted because he used insider knowledge of a biotechnology company to buy illicit stocks. Now they'll indite a Rep Senator for insider trading, yet @BarackObama @HillaryClinton

1444 2018-08-08 14:34:29 You're right that technically it's not a duster since they don't seem to have even reached the target. However it does mean the months of time and money spent on the drill was a complete waste and they have to start again 160m off to the side hence the market reaction.

There are ways to express things correct, you can prepare your words and add reminders.

Bluntly stating bad news without adding all the to date positives is just uneducate! Thats why people are using words like 'this is a duster' when ts just not the case.

1603 2018-08-08 13:44:22 This starts to confirm my suspicion that big oil investors have been working feverishly this past 2 years to manipulate markets to prop up their holdings in oil to sell high, & lower or de-value stocks like Tesla to buy into them as low as possible. This move is brilliant

1605 2018-08-08 13:42:54 Decline in stocks is not a surprising event. It recurs... If you live in cold climate, you expect freezing temperatures and when it drops below zero you don't think of this as the beginning of the next ice age. You know summer will be warm again. Stocks do the same.

1611 2018-08-08 13:41:23 To be fair, it happens on both sides.  Look at Pelosi's healthcare stocks.  All politicians should be forced to sell their stocks and buy index funds.  That way they would want the entire economy to get better and eliminate this issues.
1612 2018-08-08 13:41:03 So then by that “theory” a company making it known they “may” buy another company and then both those companies stocks jump shouldn’t be allowed either? This happens all the time, same thing.

1676 2018-08-08 13:07:40 Yeah very true n that’s the reason for that 1% I suggested only to watch n not to trade 

 n mentioned it’s too risky ! 

Last moment things can get change on Results day n even on good results stocks fall now a days !
1677 2018-08-08 13:07:33 Value investors typically look for a margin of safety and therefore pick stocks trading at a bigger discount than the intrinsic value provides.

1680 2018-08-08 13:06:37 Medicare is supposed to go broke by 2023 and you want to make it available free to all. It will be broke long before you even come close to insuring all. Are these politicians going to fund this from their bank accounts, stocks etc. This will raise taxes!

1682 2018-08-08 13:06:22 In simple terms, value investing is a strategy of investing in stocks that trade at less than their intrinsic value or those which trade at a discounted valuation.

1687 2018-08-08 13:03:26 Sir, I also decided a year ago realising that at these levels the Indian stocks are operators' play!
We can't out smart 'em in taming their beasts.
Yet now I realize that certain beaten down franchises in the sunrise economy are attracting big FPI .
So am going hand in hands.

1693 2018-08-08 13:01:16 The increasing size/reach of sovereign wealth funds definitely raises some interesting questions about what they could do if push comes to shove.

1702 2018-08-08 12:57:40 I have never seen both volatility and equity index put options volatility so cheap relative to all the macro and political risks in the marketplace. 

That does not mean stocks drop today or this week. It means over the next month we could see a 3 standard deviation drop.

1706 2018-08-08 12:55:36 How u going to make money when it’s private? A stock price moves from the exchange of money between investors, which won’t happen when it’s private. Stocks don’t rise on their own like that in a private scenario. U won’t be able to take  from other investors anymore.
1707 2018-08-08 12:55:12 Being able to create and sell derivative products and no real value to communities or nations, just personal profit. Selling stocks regularly at multiples of the underlying companies' valuation is a bubble crying out for bursting.

1710 2018-08-08 12:54:41 Chine announces 25% tariffs in $16 billion .  Trade war in full swing, that must be very bullish. I expect stocks to double shortly.  Combine that with the stock shortage @JimCramerPicks was talking about! We are all set to become super rich.

1765 2018-08-08 12:28:25 I mean sure, one can potentially outperform the market by buying individual stocks but there is zero realistic probability of doing so and thus leading with it taints the claim with snake oil/boiler room style odors. Outperformance as first claim will not help industry over time.
1766 2018-08-08 12:28:22 It high time to put things in order in-country. Believe it or not, entrepreneurs like myself are being affected. Investors are not willing to invest because they’re afraid of our democracy. Today the @nsenigeria stocks are low and the indices are not look good!
1767 2018-08-08 12:27:53 Bitcoin and all Altcoins have no intrinsic value or growth in intrinsic value thus nothing to drive long term market value.
Real Security Tokens have intrinsic value to support their market value, much like most stocks, bonds and alternative assets like art, what does @pomp say?
1768 2018-08-08 12:27:48 As a trader, I can tweet specific buys and sells of  stocks that are not clients.

1771 2018-08-08 12:24:40 Stocks and economy’s react to political decisions? Yes.

1808 2018-08-08 12:02:08 I’d love to see a 2000 point green candle so people can maybe for a half second realize they have no idea  what $btc is going to do. Whether it’s up down sideways nobody really knows. We need to all respect our own stupidity... $btc or stocks or anything we have no control over
1809 2018-08-08 12:02:07 I hope you don’t count a 5-6 pct upmove in your stocks as multibagger move since you call that much fall as an expected  crash. Moreover the result is good as india business is growing while export is being re-transitioned. Cos have phases in such moves

2049 2018-08-08 08:42:49 Seriously, you guys are writing too much clickbait stuff. Up 2 sen at 3 pm is Top 10 gainer?? Today there are at least 100 stocks above 4 sen up at the time. Yet you wonder why your readership is falling
2050 2018-08-08 08:38:58 ... Today I did order Bitcoin mining for freelancer´s job at c-cex results going onto. Walletinvestor com provides info about development of stocks and Currencies. I work rather all time, but relaxed.
2051 2018-08-08 08:38:24 Ouais. En plus, on sait déjà que les 3/4 des stocks sont mis de côté par les vendeurs. Horrible ce délire.
2052 2018-08-08 08:38:19 In truth, only people that will get hurt are the bag-holders. These tweets were easy to trade and now you know pretty much what is the upside limit for the stock. Also, it hardly is beneficial for small investors to go private and most institutions can't hold illiquid stocks.

2058 2018-08-08 08:29:54 OK, I see your point. Listing owning oil stocks along with Kremlin connections didn’t really convey that the real problem was the hypocrisy, not the owning of the index funds themselves. But I guess that was implicit since everyone knows her holier-than-though schtick.
2059 2018-08-08 08:29:05 @AJEvansII what stocks you been peeping lately?
2060 2018-08-08 08:28:32 Patrick Spencer, Baird : prefer value over growth/ momentum stocks here; earnings season has been strong but companies’ outlooks (which are positive) have been constructive surprise. View is we are mid-cycle not late cycle
2061 2018-08-08 08:28:29 3 of 4 happened in 1600's and caused worldwide famine and deaths. If you take into account the long winters and heatwaves/floods just this year alone means that countries will have to use their food stocks to keep up normal supply. Shopping for that extra tin and bottled water...
2062 2018-08-08 08:27:21 It’ll save the company from constantly “losing value” every time you tweet. Without stocks in the way, the company will earn what it earns, purely by virtue of sales, rather than by people’s opinions.
2063 2018-08-08 08:26:35 + break off completely from it. And even if karmys accept it the kmedia will be rough, they won't get brand deals and collaborations, their stocks and sales would most probably drop etc. (obviously I mean in Korea) But they are powerful and will get back to their feet in time
2064 2018-08-08 08:25:25 Been really trying to dive myself into stocks
2065 2018-08-08 08:25:22 I think financial advisors are so desperate for markets to fall. They will soon start buying stocks with all the cash they have saved over 2 years. Another rally coming soon!
2066 2018-08-08 08:24:43 Liability? Its shared with his wife.....He's not using his money as that would mean taking 10%  of his net worth. This might mean divesting stocks/companies/assets which come with fines and can be a loss.....Its an awful problem these billionaires face

2087 2018-08-08 07:55:25 Measuring all stocks by P/b and then calling the top third value and the bottom third growth is a pretty dumb way to define both of those categories, and I don't know why anyone would care what the ratio comes out to be when you compare them.

2119 2018-08-08 07:23:24 As I understand it, you can sell ever 6 months. There are a lot of large private companies, Uber is one. The interesting issue as you mentioned is that they will be low on cash, unless a company can go private without buying stocks back, not sure how that works

2172 2018-08-08 06:29:48 The type originates from the Soviet Union so many possible sources. Libya is possible but proliferation tends to be exaggerated that far south. Just speculation but it’s more likely from CAR or pilfered from Nigerian or Cameroonian state stocks.

2177 2018-08-08 06:25:26 Publicly traded business stocks are trading options against their profit, not ownership in their company.. Owners shares are called voting shares and those are special offerings to board members only. You can't buy a business in the stock market. They can set their own rules.
2178 2018-08-08 06:24:40 Let the stocks go down, maybe they will learn a lesson! The problem with twitter are not just bots, are all these trolls who live to spread hate and conspiracy theories, with complete disregard for whoever went through this tragedies.

2180 2018-08-08 06:23:10 We are slowly seeing a shift from growth to value in US stocks
2181 2018-08-08 06:22:16 Mostly, however there are other problems such as Fund Managers been forced to hold a certain percentage in stocks when they should have less exposure. Asset Allocation policies need to be more flexible. 

Public should also be more educated about investing.

2219 2018-08-08 05:37:43 Why yes, when you cut taxes for big companies and corporations they are buying all their stocks back. So is this really more jobs or CEOs buying stock. So many states have empty plants overrun by weeds. Trump handing at worker visas is the increase.

2291 2018-08-08 04:39:04 About 50% of people own stocks in the US, and most of those are in retirement plans. Another statistic: the top 20% of Americans own 92% of all stocks. Stock buybacks are great when you have a significant stake in a company. But few people do.
2292 2018-08-08 04:37:52 Trickle down is corrupt fallacy.  Poor people spend all their money because they must. Rich people save or invest in stock. Hence stocks doing well but salaries stagnant despite handouts to the rich.  If the rich spent money so much they wouldn’t be.

2310 2018-08-08 04:20:13 I agree, but those are separate issues. If you hoard cash in a mattress, it will eventually become worthless. How do people solve that issue? They invest in stocks, bonds, real estate, private business etc. (Financial assets). Without inflation, the incentive to invest lessens.

2427 2018-08-08 02:35:09 @elonmusk is a genius. He writes a simple tweet about going private and then his Tesla stock rises shortly after. Wish I had some stocks in his amazing company, it’s hard being a post-grad

2452 2018-08-08 02:19:44 The Elliot wave theory is used by some investors to try and predict certain movements of stocks. While predicting future stock prices is inconsistent, identifying these trends early on could help investors when to enter and exit the market.

2465 2018-08-08 02:17:15 Don’t get me wrong

CVN adding $500m-$600m to is market cap from a 20% interest in this project so implied project value of $2.5-$3Billion is a huge boost to Oil space and should see a lot of money flowing into the sector which is bullish for stocks like FAR
2466 2018-08-08 02:16:36 People would really choose hanging with rich people over large sums of money because of “knowledge”. That knowledge don’t mean shit if they telling you to put half a mill in bonds and a quarter mill in stocks when you got $67.92 in ya account

2468 2018-08-08 02:12:40 One of the most shorted stocks on the market (@Tesla) may go private  Shorts just got toasted, roasted, and burnt by Elon 
2469 2018-08-08 02:12:39 That began with the Christmas gift from Washington creating the Irs and the Federal Reserve Bank. And specifically deregulation on Wall Street. People buying stocks on credit. Sort of like derivative swapping. Sounds Familiar. Both parties are to blame for the wording required.
2470 2018-08-08 02:11:05 2/ and how that would relate to their other portfolio of stocks that they own (most are the type of stocks that are talked about a lot in the FinTwit universe) We believe we're pretty uncorrelated to the S&P.
2471 2018-08-08 02:10:29 I’m not “rich”, but that is a relative term. I consider myself comfortable. I grew up poor. I studied finance in my early 20s and been investing since. Now I own real estate, stocks, and crypto. I’m not “rich”, but I’m also not poor.

2477 2018-08-08 02:06:20 $TWTR should be a good swing.  $FB I already bought at 167 but sold 170’s. Yeah you like $TWTR what your price target ?

2491 2018-08-08 01:58:12 I don’t think it would be a bad idea for @elonmusk to take @Tesla private. As long as he can keep up cash flow. $TSLA #finance #stocks 

I do not have any financial interest in Tesla at the time of this post.

2493 2018-08-08 01:56:59 Don't buy there stocks, it's phony and corrupt to use God's name to make yourself money, I am sure he himself will have something to say about that to you one day. You have found no oil and have excuses about why you can't verify anything. God bless those who deserve it

2499 2018-08-08 01:52:25 Couldn't agree more. The way market makers can manipulate stocks is insane. The groups that pump stocks and encourage to sell and get away with it insane. Keep that stuff far away from sports betting...
2500 2018-08-08 01:50:36 Well said. @timmerenginerd I'll add - always be respectful.  A jab here and there is ok, personal attacks not.  Sometimes stocks and investing is far too emotional.  Aside from not asking ?'s, being emotional is your #1 enemy.
2501 2018-08-08 01:49:33 I mean.. most public IPO businesses trade stocks.. so if you invest in stocks you are investing in a business.. but it really depends how you wanna build your portfolio. Low risk low return, high risk high return, low risk high return long term, etc..
2502 2018-08-08 01:49:13 I see so you focus on the top 25 stocks than 500 of them
2503 2018-08-08 01:48:33 I view bitcoin as a time machine that will store value throughout time in a way where I won't have to worry. I don't view the US dollar or stocks in that way. I kind of view gold in that way, but think bitcoin is eating the use case for gold before our very eyes.

2527 2018-08-08 01:33:47 Sorry I don’t know much abt stocks. What happens if they go into private?
2528 2018-08-08 01:31:34 Yep time to sell your FB, twitter Instagram stocks!
2529 2018-08-08 01:27:49 Waiting for the technicals and HFTers to get into gear on the downside. Seems that's exactly what happened in January when most stocks strangely hit their consensus targets for the coming year. Bots run the show.
2530 2018-08-08 01:27:31 @Millie__Weaver when a company is listed as “public” that means that it’s open to the public to purchase stocks - it’s still privately owned. Public in the sense you’re referring to means government funded...

2533 2018-08-08 01:25:02 lmfao I think Wrighty was part of a massive pump and dump scheme. Higher ups target people with large follower counts to hype up stocks like that. I remember what he said about LTC too 
2534 2018-08-08 01:23:27 Enjoy your bitcoin, maybe one day when nobody is the governing body of your country, the stocks for cryptos will go back up?
2535 2018-08-08 01:22:59 Millie...Millie...Millie. Where to begin? 1st remove head from ass. You're suffering oxygen deprivation. Next understand that as a private company whose stocks are publicly traded, they have the right to refuse service for a reason. Their reason? They don't agree with hate-speech
2536 2018-08-08 01:22:48 There are few people that make or break a company or hold my interest. Elon Musk is one of the great ones!! While I don’t have that many shares at least I bought a few. Very few of my stocks are ones that are not for long term growth and stable. This is my wild card!Plan on ride
2537 2018-08-08 01:20:54 yeah right. About 9 months ago maybe. Penny stocks are like a joke to me. Extremely volatile but also extremely simple.

2556 2018-08-08 01:06:24 I think the some "fans" were concern coz cube stocks went down w/c means investors are pulling out their investment/not investing on the company coz of the dating issue and it will def affect the artists income including BTOB.

2558 2018-08-08 01:05:22 If you want to short stocks long term, a) stay away from big caps (95% of time), there are plenty of POS small and micro caps to pick on and b) NEVER hold out of the money, the VRX, GPRO, MNK scenarios all demonstrated you short when momentum breaks, NOT near the top.
2559 2018-08-08 01:04:48 Recently I have seen a bunch of articles with liberals telling people to stop using FB, also FB stocks fell a few weeks ago. 
all of a sudden FB does what CNN wants. Could this be something?
2560 2018-08-08 01:04:21 I stopped looking at US stocks now due to  lack of data :(
2561 2018-08-08 01:02:47 Because @CNN is behind the banning of @RealAlexJones 
CNN is losing its power over the people and it power to manipulate elections. Facebook and Youtube are just bowing down to CNN so they don't become the next targets. Notice how right after FBs stocks fell this happened.

2563 2018-08-08 00:59:45 They are traded publicly, but the people who own stocks in the company are private citizens, and therefore have the right to censor whatever the fuck they want to since they aren’t a government. I know you’re a trump supporter so logic isn’t your forté, but even a dog can think.

2569 2018-08-08 00:55:05 I’ll look it up! One of the underlying questions is what counts as the ruling body: if the thing that has an army and a flag controls less of our life than the thing that has shareholders and stocks, then perhaps Romans 13 should apply to Google and Apple and Facebook?
2570 2018-08-08 00:52:40 It’s a fun theoretical topic to beat up on, but in practice the Dow does pretty well. Grab 30 fairly representative stocks, jam them into a portfolio, and idiosyncratic risk pretty much goes away. I’m still amazed at that finding every single time I teach it. So cool!
2571 2018-08-08 00:52:28 Hehehe.. ok dear.. thanks for the pic ya.. 
2572 2018-08-08 00:52:01 they would just rent something & use the cash to buy stocks. I have tons of clients who have shifted their lives around dramatically to keep from paying 30% tax on home sales by giving house to family (and keeping low prop 13 taxes) & 100% tax creates crazy/ perverse incentives.
2573 2018-08-08 00:51:17 Just do what works for you. Wish I was in that position but unfortunately I am young and not as risk averse so I'll take my chances with stocks personally.
2574 2018-08-08 00:50:48 Guessing no chance of wild stocks getting tangled up in those nets. Just like there is no chance farm fish end up in the rivers.
2575 2018-08-08 00:50:35 The stock market grew at 250% yet the annual GDP couldn't top 3% and we were told it's impossible to obtain   so just HOW did stocks grow so large under a stagnant economy?!

2580 2018-08-08 00:44:52 It can be very profitable shorting stocks. Doesn’t mean you are against the company or have a vendetta against management. You might simply want to take advantage of an overbot equity or missed 1/4. Stocks don’t just go up forever. If it were that easy we’d all be billionaires.

2588 2018-08-08 00:39:25 I'm not sure I follow. Are you asking if we can store our DMSO compound stocks in vials or plates with each vial or plate containing tiny molecular sieves? How would that work?
2589 2018-08-08 00:39:21 Wow, you really don’t understand the difference between Public and Government much.  You also don’t appear to know how stocks work.
2590 2018-08-08 00:37:37 Maria shouldn’t you be in jail for pumping tech stocks and a fraudulent dot com bubble in the early 2000s?You and the rest of the right wing hacks on CNBC and Fox Fake Biz News are a disgrace to the real financial analysts out there who are actually committed to their clients.
2591 2018-08-08 00:34:58 However, that doesn't halt degradation of dry or DMSO compound stocks, where water content is a major driver for degradation reactions.
2592 2018-08-08 00:33:37 What do u mean? I thought stocks go up every day
2593 2018-08-08 00:33:32 Eola, were you a fan of Enron? Countrywide Financial? Indymac?  If not, then you wer in the side of people shooting their stocks when they knew (before you did) they were fraudulent abusers of public trust. But keep singing your song.
2594 2018-08-08 00:33:06 I agree completely. But what's always fascinating to me is the very high historical correlation between the Dow and the S&P, despite the Dow being price-weighted (OMG) and having only 30 stocks. Efficient frontier in action (30 stocks is sort of the magic number!)

2597 2018-08-08 00:28:34 Good point. And you seem to be a great example how if our make smart educated moves with stocks/ real estate you can crush it in the beginning to build a large net worth then worry about loans later

It was very important. We discussed bacon stocks.

2600 2018-08-08 00:26:46 I do not but maybe others do. I follow a lot of large cap stocks especially tech and if I don’t listen to their earnings calls directly, I usually read a fairly good summary.

Might be a great idea for a website

My student loans = 5% rate. Earned better return in stocks and real estate. 

10 year loan being paid off in 5. A lot of double payments

2620 2018-08-08 00:16:50 Oh you mean people that got out of crypto then tried a “reboot” with stocks. My replies were regarding people still in who have friends that pushed them into stocks and hate crypto or just think it is too young yet.

2623 2018-08-08 00:16:22 I'm with you Jim! I can't in good conscience put money into cigarette stocks, and a few other conscience-related areas, too. Money is not everything, and there are lots of other choices for good investments.
2624 2018-08-08 00:16:14 or cash out their shares at $420 a pop and buy the next stock to come into their respective markets. You don’t see $DIA tank everytime the DJIA switches out one or two of the thirty stocks in the index.

2627 2018-08-08 00:13:47 There is a difference between a public institution (something owned/operated by the government) and something publicly traded (a company that sells controlling stocks to individuals). Facebook isn't a public institution, meaning it's not owned by the government.
2628 2018-08-08 00:11:43 So the dot in the far right quadrant is somewhere in the 1930s (forget which year) and shows that stocks had a 25% real return and bonds had a 20% real return in the same year.
2629 2018-08-08 00:11:39 Thanks I’ve been getting a big out of it seems some stocks like the full numbers some like the .618s etc needs a lot more tweaking but it’s not exact that’s for sure seems a bit after the fact
2630 2018-08-08 00:11:21 I've always invested in mutual funds online myself (would strongly recommend staying away from individual stocks though) but there are literally thousands of mutual funds out there so...if you get overwhelmed I would seek.out a financial advisor in your area.
2631 2018-08-08 00:11:19 Wtf.. Get into stocks instead. Why are you making a business on fortnite skins? LMAOOOO
2632 2018-08-08 00:10:40 Thinking about all the stocks we collectively bought today 
2633 2018-08-08 00:10:20 Disagree.  They wouldn't have been in charge of ANYTHING, so if anyone was going into the stocks, it would have been THEM, as it should have been!

2635 2018-08-08 00:09:09 The economy has been doing relatively well for many years.. Thanks Obama!! Yes Corporations have their big tax cut & are primarily buying back stocks or rewarding the CEO, average workers have made minimal gains!
2636 2018-08-08 00:09:07 And by the way fellas absolutely no offense intended but tons of crypto investors know friends who have worked on them for a long time saying “screw crypto, get stocks” and have decent picks. Their advice on a stock *could* be better than say a crypto asset you say is promising.
2637 2018-08-08 00:08:52 What does it mean for the retail investor? Which has many options (of course LONG) and a few stocks?
2638 2018-08-08 00:08:10 How would that be rolled?
Out of curiosity

Is it like, go back to private then M&A?

Or is it direct cash for Top Stocks from 2 public companies?

Is there only one way this could happen or multiple?
