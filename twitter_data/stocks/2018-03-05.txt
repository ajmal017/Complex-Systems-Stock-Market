1 2018-03-05 23:58:54 @ShannonBream Bump stocks do not make weapon an "automatic". Still one bullet per trigger pull.
2 2018-03-05 23:58:47 Most of the time when these reverse splits happen with stocks on the TSX, the share price drops. #Paccoin's drop is certainly much more than I would have guessed. My average cost at #redemption was about $0.07 CDN. I just bought more so my avg is now ~ $0.04
3 2018-03-05 23:58:01 The line of sight in the next six months or so is all clear except EMA.  Not many stories to make up to support shorting the stocks.
4 2018-03-05 23:57:35 That would be illegal... crypto makes things fuzzy but at the very least it's super dishonest not to disclose that you are getting paid for something that you are promoting. Would be securities fraud if he did that with stocks.
5 2018-03-05 23:57:09 I would tend to agree that they probably own a decent amount of stocks. So are you saying they worked hard to earn their dividends or that you agree w my original point that it’s passive income that they didn’t do much to earn?

8 2018-03-05 23:55:51 All signs are pointing towards US decline. For example the reduction in the number of startup companies, the reduction in the number and variety of stocks, Corporate mergers etc.

So I ask what solutions you can offer to reinvigorate this aging Republic.

36 2018-03-05 23:48:00 RT @SenFeinstein: The ATF has already said it lacks the ability to ban bump stocks. If the president is serious about getting these deadly devices off our streets, he will support our bill and call on Republicans to stop blocking it.
37 2018-03-05 23:47:48 Your bill includes more than just bump stocks !

Write one just on bump stocks alone and it will pass !

Then someone will invent another way !
38 2018-03-05 23:47:18 All those shootings are people using semi-automatics and just pulling the trigger fast. Vegas was slightly different because of bump stocks, but those are not terrible effective because they cause jams. The other thing is that you can jury rig a bump stock with clothing items.
39 2018-03-05 23:46:44 Not just crypto, anything investment related, eg stocks, forex etc. Great time to get in, IFT is currently ridiculously undervalued
40 2018-03-05 23:45:59 In the meantime, Trump did not ban bump stocks, he got rid of the ban on importing sport hunted elephant trophies, isn't have to deal with the Stormy Daniels payment questions, etc. Trump wins each day like this unfortunately while we all lose.
41 2018-03-05 23:45:27 @realDonaldTrump Need urgently gun control with uniform background checks, no automatic weapons, bump stocks & prohibit sales of guns to less than 21 years of age We need to protect school age children now

44 2018-03-05 23:42:26 Because if we give an inch you take a mile. Bump stocks register a rifle LESS effective, thank god that monster was dumb enough to use one. PS: you wanna ban something that is NOT required to achieve that effect with any semi auto. Belt loop/rubber band can do the same. Dummy.
45 2018-03-05 23:42:23 I initially wants to explore stocks and they provide not just one training but a lot.

47 2018-03-05 23:40:48 I wonder how much of Trump’s “off-shore money” is tied up in shorting stocks.
48 2018-03-05 23:39:16 No one said anything prior to the shooting in Vegas about bump stocks. I didn't recall hearing CNN mention bump stocks either.

NRA is not controlled by gun makers. It is a membership club anyone can join.

60 2018-03-05 23:27:41 Sure. And canopy growth is the stock to buy. The world largest marijuana company. I love Canadian pot stocks. They are good for me.  That’s my tip of the year.
61 2018-03-05 23:27:21 Thanks, Gunjan.  Reinforces that it was electronic orders hitting the market en masse. It's also why stocks soared today. Not Trump tariffs, or waning worry on tariffs. It's short-term bets, automated trades, rapidly repricing collateral for ETFs, bets. Watch out.

70 2018-03-05 23:23:23 A ban on bump stocks would also be a good thing as would raising the age threshold for owning a firearm
71 2018-03-05 23:22:48 Shows how truly mad NRA is. a little cynical here as i thought GOP/NRA would sacrifice bump stocks to toss gun policy folks a bone. fact is, there's like 6 people in country who would be affected. none of us ever heard of bump stock b4  Vegas. it's not key to problem or solution.

74 2018-03-05 23:22:19 Bump stocks convert already dangerous guns to machine guns. They should already be illegal under current law. Do you think they should be legal? Be honest. Should a citizen be able to own a fully automatic weapon of war?
75 2018-03-05 23:21:59 spent like 10 minutes looking at different stocks of the same book at the book store to see which one was in better state, and then i noticed the one i bought has the last page not perfectly cut and i'm on the verge of having a panic attack everytime i think about it
76 2018-03-05 23:21:15 Tell me again how this fixes the mass shooting problem? There are hundreds of thousands of bump stocks in circulation. How many have been used to commit mass shootings. 1 that I can think of. Help me out here!
77 2018-03-05 23:20:55 @michaelianblack Nowhere does the 2nd Amendment express the right for any citizen to bear assault weapons, bump stocks, or for that matter nuclear weapons. You want a musket? Knock yourself out.

81 2018-03-05 23:18:04 Um nope. We just want sensible gun control.  I don't think ppl should have mini nukes or dirty bombs,  grenades full of killer gas... You know sensible control of weapons of war.  But keep fear mongering to sell more guns. Sale on bump stocks

84 2018-03-05 23:15:41 The fix should be not ONLY on Bump stocks, but anything that makes a rifle more powerful.
85 2018-03-05 23:15:06 15 breakouts: $GTXI (gap), $UPLD, $VCEL (gap). Nine(!) sub-$1 stocks which reflects high speculative trading and is considered bearish
86 2018-03-05 23:14:51 It was obvious that they'd bid stocks up from a low open today. If it gaps up tomorrow, I think it puts a short term top in.  Maybe until near end of year.  Tomorrow is a big bull-bear fight.  I left the day all cash
87 2018-03-05 23:14:15 the four soldiers dead should have had the bump stocks  waiting for a French Aircraft backup ...
88 2018-03-05 23:13:43 Of course it wasnt supportive, that clip was a montage of comedy and pathetic events. Imagine if that was Germany and Englands male teams doing that in a match, they would be laughing stocks in every paper in the world, dont be such a victim, it was hilariously bad football
89 2018-03-05 23:13:37 See which stocks are posting big moves after the bell.
90 2018-03-05 23:13:22 It's funny - people who call themselves "economic experts" only measure the economy by the stock market, neglecting the fact that the vast majority of people own less than a years wages in stocks, if they own any at all.
91 2018-03-05 23:12:19 In a previous tweet, I thought you mentioned you only hold 4 stocks long term, tsla, baba, nvda, and amzn. So did you sell amzn and bought nflx at some point? Or was this a typo? Or now you have 5 for long term?
92 2018-03-05 23:11:11 Americans who defend bump stocks and binary triggers are fucking idiots. they value they're impractical fun over the lives or real people. there is no use for devices that gives a semi auto rifle the ability to fire at 900 rounds per mintue
93 2018-03-05 23:11:08 Your bump stocks won't save you.
94 2018-03-05 23:10:57 An executive order banning bump stocks would be tied up in courts for YEARS and do nothing to prevent their sale in the meantime! A legislative fix is the only way to ensure the safety of our communities.
95 2018-03-05 23:10:25 It was under obama when ATF allowed bump stocks, or did you forget.

102 2018-03-05 23:08:30 I’d banish CNN to the stocks...in a heartbeat.
103 2018-03-05 23:08:30 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.
104 2018-03-05 23:07:00 17 people slaughtered in 6 minutes.  Work all sides of the issue including banning/limiting access to the AR-15 (gun of choice by mass shooters) &  accessories such as bump stocks & hi-capacity mags.
105 2018-03-05 23:05:27 Tax Reform Update:

112 2018-03-05 23:01:56 The ATF is reluctant to do anything about bump stocks because they know it does not fit the machine gun narrative.  They are pieces of plastic, inanimate objects that do nothing unless some adle brained drug induced miscreant decides to employ one.  They are not the problem.

123 2018-03-05 22:57:47 Other than the banning the sales of bump stocks, you arent going to get rid of them.  as soon as you start talking about it again Millions more will be sold--unless you're going door-to-door to get them back I don't see people turning them in. Sales are up!
124 2018-03-05 22:57:40 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS wants to ban bump stocks & then what? Hammers, knives, pressure cookers...cars? Those that want to harm others will ALWAYS find a way. Why not get to the bottom of the real problem? Failures of government agencies that are tasked to protect the public.

130 2018-03-05 22:55:59 Tories deliberately built up coal stocks to enable them to attempt to break the NUM. If there was no market, why did they then buy coal from Eastern Europe, & what fuel were the power stations then using ?
131 2018-03-05 22:55:49 Shareholders are Americans too.  You probably have corporation stocks in you Government provided pension plan. Are you planning on giving up all the benefits of the plan when you retire. I doubt it

133 2018-03-05 22:53:54 You mean like favoring universal background checks,and banning bump stocks,and funding Planned Parenthood and continuing to militarize the police and taking guns away first then worrying about due process? REALLY? Call a spade a spade!
134 2018-03-05 22:52:43 I almost left the house today to replenish our empty whiskey and butter stocks, but I thought, no! I can have a no-spend day. I mean, if you're still using your encarta mousepad...

136 2018-03-05 22:52:01 I can NOT understand why you don't gather all this support up + fly me out there so "WE" can make "GUNS"be the reason for the debate... not bump stocks, rules, laws, age limits, metal detectors, AR15, police in schools, I HAVE THE IDEA'S THAT WILL WORK! You NOW have the support!
137 2018-03-05 22:51:39 armed security guards go through background checks and do not carry AR-15s with bump stocks.
138 2018-03-05 22:51:26 It’s amazing that your buddy Carl Icahn sold off $31.3 million in stocks he owned in a steel-dependent company, just days before the you announced hefty tariffs on foreign-made steel. Can you say insider trading?
139 2018-03-05 22:50:23 Please show me one state, one community, one town that outlaws bump stocks in order to keep all of us safer.

141 2018-03-05 22:49:50 love reading those "Find out how this guy retired at 30!" type articles and then like 3 paragraphs in he says "my grandma bought me stocks when I was seven"
142 2018-03-05 22:49:50 Sick as a pike. Been living off paracetamol and Fisherman’s Friends for days. Legs weak and wobbly. Could take a tumble at any minute, like Davro in the stocks.
143 2018-03-05 22:49:42 See if you can read anywhere if it'll do a split. Usually if the company is doing well it could split and if you want to make money, you want a split. I would. I mean it's penny stocks  also, diversify and buy different commodities and compare to see which ones are "hot"
144 2018-03-05 22:49:18 Carl Icahn unloads millions in steel-related stocks days before Trump's Tariff. Seems a pittance compared to Martha Stewart's utter lawlessness in shedding thousands, getting 5 years for the deal. Hmmm smgdh
145 2018-03-05 22:49:07 LOL Nobody is ever more wrong than @BillKristol whether it's stocks which he knows nothing about or the Presidency which he knows nothing about!
146 2018-03-05 22:49:00 1947 was a lovely vintage for #PolRoger but 1928 was Sir Winston Churchill’s true favourite vintage. A case was delivered from #Epernay to him every year for his birthday and he drank it until stocks became perilously low....

151 2018-03-05 22:45:30 What famous trader said that computer + man cannot be beat. The best of both worlds is what is driving long term profits in not only equity stocks, but now cryptocurrencies (altcoins).
152 2018-03-05 22:44:56 Wayne LaPierre says no control over bump stocks. And everyone that he supports will listen to him. Now can you answer a question for me? When the 2nd Amendment came about weren't they still using muskets? The hunters I know do not use assault weapons to hunt.
153 2018-03-05 22:44:53 Twitter stocks are going up man.... I’m here waiting for them to be back down to 29 at least .. it’s at 34!! Fuck lmao so I just said fuck it and got two shares . Let’s hope I don’t regret this later haha
154 2018-03-05 22:42:56 Them selling there stocks is not the huge story because its spoken about in the public eye. But this topic is definitely something he should cover.
155 2018-03-05 22:42:45 Humana plans to return 50% of tax reform benefit to shareholders. Most of which will go to the richest 10% of American households since they own 84% of stocks (as of 2016).
156 2018-03-05 22:41:41 In which case you have just proven the point for banning assault weapons, extended mags, bump stocks etc. Take the weapons away so they can't be used.
Such a simple solution that has been proven to work.

159 2018-03-05 22:38:41 Wrong. Asking for sensible gun laws, ban on AR 15, large magazines and bump stocks in no way harm the second amendment. ZDLoesch doesn't give a rat's ass about dead children. Guns are far more important to her

163 2018-03-05 22:36:21 All these NFL front offices putting out false draft stocks on these players so they hope other teams will be stupid enough to believe the hype. Smart concept but everyone sees Lamar Jackson isn’t the #2 QB in the draft right?

165 2018-03-05 22:36:04 A stock split makes stocks more liquid. More shares for more people to buy. In your case it was a reverse split so it has the same value, just less shares. If you had 50 shares, it would've turned into 2... same value tho. All it did was increase the price of the one share.

180 2018-03-05 22:29:15 The NY Senate is failing NYers by failing to address the crisis of mass school shootings today with empty slogans on vanity license plates instead of creating extreme risk protection orders, banning bump stocks, improving background checks. The #NRA must be proud!
181 2018-03-05 22:26:17 I knew stocks were up when I turned to msnbc because the bottom right screen didnt show the Dow.
182 2018-03-05 22:26:08 The ATF has already said it lacks the ability to ban bump stocks. If the president is serious about getting these deadly devices off our streets, he will support our bill and call on Republicans to stop blocking it.

186 2018-03-05 22:23:40 The NRA said they supported "additional regulations" related to bump stocks. They had to say something after one gunman wounded hundreds of people. They managed to not choke on their words because the major gunmakers don't make bumpstocks.

251 2018-03-05 21:49:21 Quick lesson on stocks/cryptos:

Marketcap, marketcap, marketcap. The price of a stock is important because it tells you how many you can afford and obviously having more shares is likely to gain you more profit. However, marketcap is what's really important
252 2018-03-05 21:47:57 I am down $67k from my high of $187k. Hopefully the market will rebound but who can complain i started off with 5k
253 2018-03-05 21:46:40 Any advice to people who are looking to get into stocks that have no experience?
254 2018-03-05 21:46:28  Make background checks universal 
 Ban assault weapons 
 Ban bump stocks
 Raise the minimum age to purchase rifles

260 2018-03-05 21:42:34 I’m still yet to exit a position in 2018, though I am left wondering if I have finally learned patience, or I am missing opportunities elsewhere. 

There are loads of interesting stocks on my watchlist, just not enough to sell for!

272 2018-03-05 21:35:10 My question is how much of those stocks he dumped for a profit did he buy back AFTER the price plummeted? Then we will know if fRUMP is going to actually go through with this tariff or not!
273 2018-03-05 21:34:28 Thanks Helen, I am very pleased to be in $BLPH as heavily and cheaply as I am.  I will be patient as I expected a fantastic home run with these shares, as well as $APTO.  As you said many thanks to Dr KSS for leading me, us, we, to these and many other great stocks.

295 2018-03-05 21:22:22 The comparisons are not worthless. American lives are not worthless. 

We can do better. 

Bump stocks should be illegal. High capacity magazines are not necessary to protect. AR-15s can be banned, like machine guns. Mental health needs to be addressed. We do nothing. #Deadly

300 2018-03-05 21:18:08 You mean the millions that Howard and Costello made by selling off our gold stocks and losing billions that we could have had. Yeah Real economic geniuses.
301 2018-03-05 21:17:11 @smitttles got me into investing so naturally if my stocks are down its because he's a dumbass and its his fault, but if my stocks are up its because I AM the wolf of Wall St.
302 2018-03-05 21:16:12 BTW I've stories if I ever would write book about but probably not. Trading through major broker I'dd give hard time to trainees assigned to my account to push stocks down when I bought, I'd average down relentlessly and could feel their agony and breakdown when they lost :)

308 2018-03-05 21:15:28 Time has consistently proved that teams can easily become laughing stocks. Next fixture, #mufc against @LFC. On the back of this performance? Not convinced. In the meantime, the best @Alexis_Sanchez performance in a @ManUtd shirt remains the piano play. #ggmu

310 2018-03-05 21:14:42 Another very impressive day for growth stocks, including a few that are flying. $NTNX $MU $SQ That said, with the market still iffy, not sure chasing things/big positions is the best idea. Further market pullbacks would provide nice test for some strong names.
311 2018-03-05 21:14:04 Gee, where are we with restoring the Obama-era background checks that include mental illness restrictions, closing the gun show loophole, getting rid of bump stocks, raising the the age limit to purchase semiautomatic weapons ? Oh, that’s right. The NRA told Trump no. #Neveragain
312 2018-03-05 21:12:52 Stocks recoup a bit from last week's rout.

320 2018-03-05 21:08:00 Good day. Restarted short positions on American indices, looking to build it further. Liked the Cdn O&G space! Getting frustrated with my uranium stocks but keeping a longer term mindset on those.

322 2018-03-05 21:07:47 1 year ago today Netflix stocks were $97.66 today they’re now $315. Y’all ever think about what if you ain’t buy them kicks or clothes and got stocks where would you be?
323 2018-03-05 21:07:38 Semi automatic and automatic rifles need to be banned in private ownership. It's that simple and this includes bump stocks.
324 2018-03-05 21:07:11 @NiklasReinecke said governments and aid organisations from all over the world are using @DLR_en data to evaluate areas of risk for their countries - for example, using the data to track changes in crop stocks to ensure a high enough yield for the population #WhatOnEarth2018

327 2018-03-05 21:06:09 Congress should investigate Trump confidante Carl Icahn dumping millions of dollars worth of steel stocks right before Trump announced his support for tariffs.
328 2018-03-05 21:05:45 $TGT will have a good report,  management continues to do a great job in driving sales growth at a consistent pace.

329 2018-03-05 21:04:31 Stocks on the upswing. The Dow closed at 24,874.76, up 336.70 (+1.37%). Nasdaq +1.00%. S&P +1.10%.
330 2018-03-05 21:03:33 Very solid day for some weed stocks.  $weed turned into beast.  Others ugly. Overall not a bad day.  See everyone tommo
331 2018-03-05 21:01:40 #US stocks rose and #Treasuries fell as investors speculated that President #Donald #Trump's tough tariff talk won't translate into the most severe protectionist policies!
332 2018-03-05 21:01:38 It's pretty straight forward honestly.
AoT members get emailed 2-3 stocks each evening to watch the NEXT day! 
Once/if the stocks trigger, i will quiclly email, SMS and tweet out the entries and stop losses and i'll walk members thru the trades! 
Lots of EDUCATION along the way!
333 2018-03-05 21:01:38 When I first started trading I thought that during market corrections the stocks holding up well would '"catch down" with the market. Only took a couple trades with my puts going to zero to really learn the concept of relative strength.
334 2018-03-05 21:01:16 Gun control need on machine guns and bump stocks! Do what you promised those kids in Florida. Liar. Your in the pockets of the NRA.
335 2018-03-05 20:59:55 Good news. Time to dump gun & ammo stocks stat.
336 2018-03-05 20:59:54 Not a bad idea strictly based off past performance and more importantly, possible market cap growth. Other factors like competition and evolution of technology (twitter could be a thing of the  past in 5 years) matter too though but if you have extra funds for stocks, do it
337 2018-03-05 20:59:04 Ca marche le temps d’écouler les stocks, aprè tout ce qui est impirté coûtera plus cher, donc inflation, perte de pouvoir d’achat, baisse de compétitivité, etc.
338 2018-03-05 20:58:30 So what’s the point here? Stocks as overvalued as 2000? Just can’t agree with that
339 2018-03-05 20:58:28 Nigga asking the purchase percentage on stocks and all this extra shit that is in the handbook. I’m annoyed.
340 2018-03-05 20:57:59 When the SCOTUS ruled that individuals have the "right to bear arms" they also said that it didn't apply to AR15s. So when people say they have a 'right' to own AR15s or bump stocks, they are wrong.

346 2018-03-05 20:53:18 Yet Trump purposes using an EO to regulate bump stocks...hmmm.  He's ok with EO as long as it's in his interest but bad mouths them when Obama used them.
347 2018-03-05 20:53:13 How about you refund your NRA donations to someone who really needs that money..say VETERANS or VICTIMS FAMILIES!! I see there's no other proposals..such as banning assault weapons, raising the age limit, banning bum stocks...I guess those weren't allowed in your BLOOD MONEY!!

350 2018-03-05 20:51:34 Is that why you can never buy them anywhere in the shops which is a frustration to us.  You need to ensure proper stocks are in the shops and supermarkets. We try just about everywhere to buy our favourites

361 2018-03-05 20:46:43 It's March 5 and on March 1 @realDonaldTrump said that he would take care of bump stocks. "It's done."  We sit here without an EO.  #TrumpLiesMatter

376 2018-03-05 20:41:26 The alt-right and Trump are fixated on Hillary and Pres. Obama. Though out of politics, we ask why? They know if their voter base takes a good look at what they done ie: The possible trade war, stocks crashing and kissing Bibi’s and Putin’s butt, there will be supporter backlash.

505 2018-03-05 19:37:34 I believe your making bump stocks illegal was a good move. I also believe that enforcing the gun laws already in place and creating better mental health care and availability will decrease gun violence. Adding more useless laws that aren’t enforced will not help.

507 2018-03-05 19:36:40 I currently cannot support the NRA because of their position on bump stocks. Frankly I think people should have access to everything the military has to have a well regulated militia. That means nukes if you can afford them. :^)

524 2018-03-05 19:27:58 If Trump fires Sessions or Sessions resigns, marijuana stocks listed in Canada are going to sky rocket back to all time highs and beyond. Aurora (up 5%), Canopy ($WEED) and a few more. #stockstowatch
525 2018-03-05 19:27:08 I'm in both from Friday, but I've done enough chart study to know when the crowd loves a trade it inevitably fails and  I can't think of any stocks that have more obvious breakouts.
526 2018-03-05 19:26:59 Is #Trump genius today, & master #economic negotiator for USA, because #Dow was up 270 & more (who knows, as I write this, which way #MomentumTrading has turned)? No, as he was not stupid (#media #AntiTrump take, as they ignore up moves) because #stocks went down last week.

529 2018-03-05 19:26:01 I haven’t seen many companies using this for raising wages and creating jobs. They have been buying back a whole lot of their own stocks. If the corps were not so greedy then maybe I could buy into this but they only care about shareholder value. That doesn’t grow the economy.
530 2018-03-05 19:25:35 $USDJPY pierces 106.00 and tracks US stocks turning positive. $AUDUSD recovering to around 0.7760 with stocks ahead of the #RBA
531 2018-03-05 19:23:47 What's with the top management of super markets that they cannot get essential every day foods into their super markets Bread for instance your  model stocks  just work out you need double the amount of bread  Its Bizarre

543 2018-03-05 19:18:58 I’d say it’s attached to stocks and ETFs! lol
544 2018-03-05 19:17:35 Yields on corporate bonds are still much lower than the earnings yield on US stocks. That means people are very pessimistic about growth. Everyone is still miserable.
545 2018-03-05 19:17:25 Local banks stocks. Well managed, low p/e, good dividends, always the chance of a takeover/merger.
546 2018-03-05 19:16:42 My main concern is that several of my stocks are now doing their Crowd breakouts $SQ and $MU playing that 50.   I'm positioned well in both stocks, but I bet both will get stuffed on this first run. But that's cool, I'll add to my position when they pull back.
547 2018-03-05 19:16:25 Carl to Donald.  "Tomorrow I will sell my steel and alum stocks.  3 Days later you announce tarriffs.  How much of a cut will you need, 20% ?
548 2018-03-05 19:15:47 Bearish pundit citing 24x trailing 12 month PE for $SPY  so many things wrong here. First, stocks discount FUTURE earnings / cash flows. Look forward not back. Second, last year's earnings = no tax cuts. Future earnings = tax cuts. How could he overlook this with a straight face?
549 2018-03-05 19:14:37 There is no fish left anywhere in any case. Although stocks are reported to be recovering, thanks to catch limits and bans imposed .... by the EU.

555 2018-03-05 19:09:52 My question last night to my husband, should Ichan be investigated for his dump of stocks?
556 2018-03-05 19:09:09 all the gold money can buy stocks, right! liquidate the gold on a global scale then use proceeds to invest in high cash flow businesss
557 2018-03-05 19:09:00 14 of the 91 stocks that we’ve added to @rubicoin‘s Showroom have over doubled in value - that’s >15% hit rate. 30 of 91, or one-third, are up over 50%. 

But we’re only getting started. These are the very early days of a small business out to create a global brand of our own.
558 2018-03-05 19:08:22 And? Wtf did they do about it? Will anything be done about it? What about trump's buddy Carl Icahn dumping millions in steel stocks last week, will ANYTHING be done about that? Martha Stewart went to prison for far less an amount!

562 2018-03-05 19:06:56 bump fire is the act of using the recoil of a semi-automatic firearm to fire shots in rapid succession, which simulates the ability of a fully automatic firearm. Bump fire stocks, gunstocks that are specially designed to make bump firing easier. This is the PROBLEM

571 2018-03-05 19:01:20 Avoid the topic of defining assault weapon and discussing terminology. The difference between an AR15 and mini14 is mainly marketing. Some people just prefer wood stocks to plastic. The whole argument is just a distraction and a trap to discredit a person based on lack of jargon
572 2018-03-05 19:01:12 It's possible to make strong gains in bad times - often that's the best time to make them. Low interest rates? Great, you can borrow to invest. High interest rates? Great, get saving. Stocks are high - great, sell and profit. Stocks are low - great, buy some bargains! #Investing
573 2018-03-05 19:00:50 Today would be a good day for @TIAA to divest itself from all gun stocks. #TeachersAndGunsDontMix #teachers
574 2018-03-05 19:00:35 Personal I'd rather Gvt instead facilitate a more efficient market (and also look to remove incentives pushing up prices).

Were currently spending tax on propping up the housing market ... 

Boost supply and try manage the view it's a one way ticket to 'easy money'.

605 2018-03-05 18:58:50 Would much rather be shot with an AR than a double barrel shot gun. I agree with bump stocks and large clips but it takes about 2 seconds to dump a clip and put in another on. Small clips are easier to carry and conceal. So it's not going to make things better.
606 2018-03-05 18:58:26 Did Jared short the market and make a billion dollars on his tariff announcement !!!
I’m sure Carl Icahn isn’t the only one that made millions dumping steel stocks !!!

609 2018-03-05 18:56:51 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS 
What happened to
1. Background checks
2. Minimum age of 21
3. Bumper stocks
4. Banning assault weapons
610 2018-03-05 18:56:26 buying intraday hopium of a breakdown (or bounce in $VXX) is like equity bulls trying to buy bounces in stocks we/th. $SPY vs $VX_F
611 2018-03-05 18:56:12 Of course understanding all too well, if you are in the business of selling stocks you will always find the proper reasoning to be bullish stocks
612 2018-03-05 18:55:59 BUY STOCKS!
613 2018-03-05 18:55:55 Stocks?
614 2018-03-05 18:55:47 Its just common sense! Anyone who disagrees has a political bias, and is willing to see more children/people die because of their beliefs! Background checks on 100% of gun sales, no bump stocks, no assault weapons is a good start!
615 2018-03-05 18:55:45 Stocks and grain
616 2018-03-05 18:55:29 Well the resources are shared anyway as fish stocks are mobile, so this is a much smaller question. I'm also struggling to see how tariff-free market access is more/less unsavoury than, say, paying money for access. Most people of all stripes seem happy with that latter option.
617 2018-03-05 18:53:51 2018 version of the old public stocks !!! Get your rotten fruit ready.....
618 2018-03-05 18:53:31 They now have the parts to make ARs feed from fixed magazines with thumbhole stocks. AKs would be easier to do so. It's most likely to upset people (including many of their bases) for banning guns that they perceive as having nothing to do with it and ample use for.
619 2018-03-05 18:53:10 Stig, Is there any kind of book you know of that explores well the psychology of retirees as it relates to holding stocks and taking on more or less risk? where can i learn more about this?
620 2018-03-05 18:52:57 Mandla should have mentioned Stocks and LTA #isibaya
621 2018-03-05 18:52:53 Saw another false headline: "Stocks rise as investor (lie) fears of #TradeWar ease." IN ONE DAY!? Nope. Irrelevant short term #psychological "noise" is exaggerated by short term #ComputerTrading into "volatile" move with no connection to #economic reality.
622 2018-03-05 18:51:57 Some may say I work too hard for a 19 year old to be working 50+ hours a week but really I’m working smart. I put 80% of my money in stocks and cripto. The future is coming faster than yal think, don’t be the person who said “I wish I invested” type of person. 
623 2018-03-05 18:50:59 It makes me wonder if they may be trading on foreign stock exchanges as well. Kinda like splitting their foreign profits & respective stocks from domestic profits & sticks. Just thinking?

625 2018-03-05 18:50:37 #Stocks | For U.S. stocks, a material escalation toward protectionism would involve additional risks, increase volatility further, and likely dampen broader risk appetite. That scenario would also mean "downside" for Treasury yields this year. cc. @MorganStanley $DJIA $SPX $NDX
626 2018-03-05 18:50:12 Hey I just saw Snap stocks fall by 15% a minute ago, did you happen to delete Snapchat?
627 2018-03-05 18:50:04 Proper attribution to Michelle Obama is in order here.  I also hope that this is a change in heart about weapons of mass killing and that the high road results in reversal of policy as to CDC reporting, bump stocks and closing gun show loophole.

667 2018-03-05 18:39:29 Went to my local @coopukfood #Dawlish after work, no milk, no bread, no fruit & veg, no toilet rolls(?!) VERY limited stocks of pretty much else except Easter Eggs & Chocolate! Quite frightening what a couple of days snow can do to a country! #SNOWMAGGEDDON #milk #bread

670 2018-03-05 18:39:02 UK Market Close: Turnaround on Wall Street boosts stocks, trade frictions in focus
671 2018-03-05 18:38:22 Do you mean, changing the minimum age to 21, limiting magazine size and capacity,  closing the gun show and internet loopholes, banning bump stocks? Because if that is NOT what you are talking about....well I DON'T AGREE! #NeverAgainMSD
672 2018-03-05 18:37:33 Where are we when a teen has to express this?A country where @NRA is bought & sold by the gun manufacturers & the Gov’t is bought by the NRA?No one wants to end 2nd Amendment but we do want bans on weapons of war,bump stocks,large mags .Need better background checks ! #NeverAgain
673 2018-03-05 18:37:21 Which given debt levels and valuations *should* , imo, be mega bearish for stocks.   We shall see
674 2018-03-05 18:36:37 Lol yup one day later that was fast
675 2018-03-05 18:36:09 Exactly, without the quotas there would be NO fishing industry, through destruction of stocks.
676 2018-03-05 18:36:05 Agreed I have top in stocks tomorrow and dxy going bid . You know what happens to pms . Just my opinion silkymany thanks.will position tom
677 2018-03-05 18:35:35 Banning bump stocks seems pretty obvi

679 2018-03-05 18:33:56 Ban assault weapons, high capacity magazines & bump stocks. What is so Fucking hard about that. I'm a hunter. We don't need that shit. You can only have three shells in your shotgun to hunt dove. Dove are protected more than children.
#BanAssaultWeapons
#EnoughIsEnough
680 2018-03-05 18:33:49 Trump forgot to tell Ryan to dump his steel stocks
681 2018-03-05 18:33:47 IMO, employers would be smart to give employees somekind of participation in their corp profits, or facilitate 401s, etc., (but totally optional). And those that are publicly traded in exchanges should facilitate & incentivize employees to buy corp stocks thru payroll deductions
682 2018-03-05 18:33:30 Not sure I'd go quite that far. It's all legitimate actuarial language. Accept some risk there is no deficit; if you want a bit less risk, then there is (Because you're projecting things like stocks out 40 years) 

But I'll leave to you to judge how this has been communicated...
683 2018-03-05 18:33:05 AND please let’s look at which Senators and Representatives have money invested in gun manufacturers stocks. Follow the money. The big money is in the stock market - also the BIG conflict of interest.
684 2018-03-05 18:32:40 Plus they are so many other stocks that performed much more. I don t understand this choice of Boeing
685 2018-03-05 18:32:32 @RoverRadio I'm sick of JLR bc I don't make a lot of money. Gets more help than me and I got a crippling diesese. He's the biggest POS around. I don't have stocks bonds property etc. Sick of him
686 2018-03-05 18:31:54 The game #WallStreet plays. You can almost bet a division of MS will be buying #lithium #stocks. They will call it the #contrarian #sector. That's how they feed their own EPS & each div. shows a profit. Reverse what they say after the initial reaction  3 days.If Things intact buy
687 2018-03-05 18:31:54 Bump stocks don’t increase ammo capacity and what the hell is a “market clip”?  Not to mention there are plenty handguns that hold 15+ rounds...
688 2018-03-05 18:31:23 Rocket Propelled Grenades?! And unless they have the capability to go FULLY automatic they are not what the military use. I do agree we need to ban after market bump stocks and the like, but thanks to DIY YouTubers it’s a moot point.
689 2018-03-05 18:31:18 @Stocks_Numbers told you it’ll get there soon 
690 2018-03-05 18:30:07 Stocks are taking another down turn and looks like tariff missteps as Trump continues to blunder through his job. Not smart enough to know his limitations and when to call in experts. Hope his term ends before America crashes.
691 2018-03-05 18:29:29 Don't have any of those. I know some people with some tan Ugg boots like those stocks, though.
692 2018-03-05 18:29:17 LOL got to love how the news always tries to play the stocks. It goes up because it does. It goes down because it does. Yes its just that simple. Some days people buy, some they sell.
693 2018-03-05 18:28:46 TWO STOCKS THAT HAVE BIG MOVE POTENTIAL
$OHGI:Currently being squeezed by 200 ma and 13 ema at 1.14. break of 1.25 and this can go to 1.58 where the 50 ma is. Known for big moves
$LMFA:Currently being squeezed by 13 ema and 50 ma. Watch for a break of 1.60 for volume to roll in.

700 2018-03-05 18:26:36 @AndrewBellBNN where do u see lithium stocks' future and ur recommendations for some investments pls
701 2018-03-05 18:26:01 Anyone stupid enough to avoid banning bump stocks needs to go back and listen to the audio of the Las Vegas massacre.  Those bullets were being fired as fast as in any true life war zone.  It is absolute insanity to allow bump stocks to be sold legally.
702 2018-03-05 18:25:56 $TCON Low float stocks are amazing due to it can sky rocket. Don’t sell any share and make what you’re holding more valuable. $5-$10’s comin
703 2018-03-05 18:25:52 i think the advice is usually to pay off 15-20% credit cards before investing in 8-12% stocks & mutual funds.

770 2018-03-05 18:22:59 I assume that Trump hasn't proscribed bump stocks via executive order so far today because he's poring over draft court papers to initiate long-awaited lawsuits against his many sexual misconduct accusers.

791 2018-03-05 18:13:05 No.  They have to replace in kind, as stocks enable them to do so, in order to balance the books, so to speak.
792 2018-03-05 18:12:59 People are going to throw things at it, so maybe a statue of Thatcher in the stocks?
793 2018-03-05 18:11:58 More dangerous than bump stocks.  According to the FBI, 67,642 murders were committed in the U.S. from 2005 through 2008, and 115,717 from 2003 through 2009. The General Accounting Office documents that criminal immigrants committed 25,064 of these murders.

797 2018-03-05 18:10:44 You're anti-NRA and anti-Trump, even though Trump endorsed banning bump stocks and the like? Why even bother pretending you give a crap about gun control and just say you're a Dem PAC?
798 2018-03-05 18:10:36 All debt stocks will now face intense scrutiny. Second, these companies became NPAs because of investment in power plants. On this day, no private investor wants to set up a power plant. How much can the public sector absorb?

802 2018-03-05 18:07:39 Not necessarily. If rates rise too far, too fast & it adversely impacts $SPY EPS expectations, then it is bad for stocks. If rates rise & EPS expectations keep improving, stocks rise in-line w/ earnings. Most don’t understand this.

810 2018-03-05 18:02:26 The type of gun used repeatedly in mass shootings is not a reasonable, appropriate and viable weapon of self defense. What about increasing age limits, background checks, waiting periods, restrictions on persons with certain types of offenses, eliminating bump stocks?
811 2018-03-05 18:02:10 "The Florida Senate is expected to vote on a school safety bill. What it does:
Ban the sale of bump stocks
Make a mass shooting a 2nd degree felony

What it doesn't do:
Put a 2-year moratorium on the sale of AR-15's
Ban assault weapons"
812 2018-03-05 18:02:06 i just love how all these #2ndAmendment gun nuts think their precious AR-15s and bump stocks will actually "defend them from tyranny" when that tyranny has aircraft carriers housing F-22s and drones and nukes and...you get my point.
813 2018-03-05 18:01:57 I invested into MJ stocks might as well make money for smoking it lol
814 2018-03-05 18:01:19 I’m betting you can. If they pay taxes, use healthcare, collect Social Security, use natural gas, looking to sell their homes, have a 401K, or own any stocks I bet they’ll vote Republican. Oh, pro-life, 1st & 2nd amendments... You can do it! 
815 2018-03-05 18:01:10 Bump stocks is barely a start. We must #BanAssaultWeapons sales to civilians in the US.

829 2018-03-05 17:56:12 The Florida Senate is expected to vote on a school safety bill. What it does:
Ban the sale of bump stocks
Make a mass shooting a 2nd degree felony

What it doesn't do:
Put a 2-year moratorium on the sale of AR-15's
Ban assault weapons

837 2018-03-05 17:52:25 What are your views on the unconstitutional request of the NRA to have the ATF, in a simple sense,  write laws in regards to "bump fire stocks." And @realDonaldTrump attempt to circumvent due process. @benshapiro

839 2018-03-05 17:51:09 58 people dead. 851 injured. 

Major reason: Bump stocks.

Bump stocks: Accessory that makes it impossible to aim gun, only good for reckless gunners and mass shooters.

@marcorubio and @GOP: Why no ban? U REALLY think 2nd Amend means right to keep & bear accessories? Stop lying.

841 2018-03-05 17:50:58 Give me a break. He had no trades for the last few years. His last trade was in 2015 and then out of no where he dumps over 3million in stocks a week before the announcement. PuuuLEASE!!!!!!! Walks like a duck quake like a duck 
842 2018-03-05 17:50:44 If pressed, I'd say start with having some common sense laws. Ban high-capacity magazines, bump stocks, and other mods that make it easier to create a weapon close to military grade. Just saying "more guns" creates a loop of violence.
843 2018-03-05 17:49:54 I could be wrong here, but it looks like our campus convenience store stocks more turkey, cranberry, and horseradish on raisin and walnut bread than just plain PB&J, and I find that extremely perplexing.

847 2018-03-05 17:46:26 Bump stocks serve no purpose other than increasing carnage, reduces aim and raises possibility of hitting unintended targets, no valid purpose
848 2018-03-05 17:46:19 U.S.Stocks erased earlier losses as investors mulled over potential U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs.
849 2018-03-05 17:46:09 The NRA doesn't care about bump stocks. They're legal because they can't be regulated as automatic weapon accessories by the ATF. The no-fly list issue was about due process, not about allowing people to buy AR-15s. Just total dishonesty on your part.

853 2018-03-05 17:43:17 This is one of the more dishonest tweets I've seen in a long time. From bump stocks to the no-fly issue, you've shown that you really don't care about telling the truth in order to make a point. How awful.

957 2018-03-05 17:25:11 I don't see that as stronger wording. And I doubt any court has either. There are many restrictions on the 2A. This isn't a question of whether, say, banning bump stocks is constitutional. It's a question of just doing it.

974 2018-03-05 17:20:04 I've been eating kota since mid January. My kota person stocks at enterprise plk. So it's either the listeriosis outbreak in enterprise is new (last week things) or all of this is a lie or the people in plk are immune.
975 2018-03-05 17:20:00 We agree this is the message of the paper. Stocks are huge, likely bigger than we state. keeping this carbon locked away is a must.
976 2018-03-05 17:19:59 Though #Trump actions may be unpredictable, one thing is certain is that is "bark" is more than his "bite". He will usually talks a big game, but when it comes to implementation, he usually fumbles because there is always more to a process then sheer rhetoric. #bonds #stocks #GDP
977 2018-03-05 17:19:39 Banning Bump-Stocks, AR-15's & AK-47's, Improved Background Checks & Hardening School Security top the gun-control legislation debate - what passes?
978 2018-03-05 17:18:55 Why are you making this so damn difficult, .@sentoomey?! Ban bump stocks (because the DOJ apparently can't figure our if they're illegal by now) and ban access to semi-automatic firearms. 

There. DONE.
979 2018-03-05 17:18:15 You buy more when the stocks are plummeting...diversifying my portfolio broham. I’m working lol
980 2018-03-05 17:17:23 @sunny Please address Meghan McCain's comment this weekend on "This Week' about her support 4 the #NRA! She also would not answer a question about Banning Bump Stocks.  Is she 4 protecting R children, or not? Why does "The View" have her on when she does not care about R children

984 2018-03-05 17:15:48 You never short stocks in strong uptrends, you will have to wait until the market breaks and that may be a ways off.

987 2018-03-05 17:15:37 I think there are two possibilities.
1. The one that get listed and published might not a better stock, that just happened to attract more noob people like me to invest in that stock.
2. The stocks listed are a best stock with good dividend.

988 2018-03-05 17:14:49 Great story. Big banks make less money structuring, underwriting and trading stocks/bonds/other products when they have to hold cash to protect against taxpayer bailouts.
989 2018-03-05 17:14:28 Hoy se ha disparado bastante el mercado, ver la oportunidad de posicionarse la semana pasada os está dando un resultado genial. Yo me posicione muy poco, esperemos ahora que el mercado siga fuerte los próximos días para que se puedan cubrir cómodamente las posiciones.

We hear about the “TRADE DEFICIT” and its concerns.
But can someone give me a “CAPITAL NUMBER” and it’s plus or minus number.
Example, maybe like the Gains and Dividends of US owned European and Asian Stocks.
And why Washington does not include this number.
992 2018-03-05 17:12:56 Yeah, it sucks and R/S are typically bearish. But, they now have a low float and can pop. You have to weigh out opportunity costs here. This is also the risk of playing penny stocks that are $.08.
993 2018-03-05 17:12:50 All three indices in the green today...good day for strong stocks
994 2018-03-05 17:12:39 Markets are at enough negativity... despite election results (Good) markets slided today....it's means lot more fear is there in the markets...I will hold my stocks , will not sell single share....lot more buying opportunities may come in coming days.
995 2018-03-05 17:12:37 Might pay to wait for a market correction before buying more stocks.

998 2018-03-05 17:11:11 I'm progressive, and I'm not anti-gun, as long as that firearm has a purpose other than killing PEOPLE. Assault weapons, bump stocks and high-capacity magazines have NO OTHER PURPOSE than to kill the most people in the least amount of time. We're supposed to be civilized..
999 2018-03-05 17:10:57 Impressive rebound for stocks. And Walmart looks to get into the meal delivery biz to compete against Amazon. That's bad news for Blue Apron. I'll discuss with @maggielake on @cnni at 12:40 ET. $WMT $AMZN $APRN

1010 2018-03-05 17:06:25 Maybe buy some stocks and start listening to ER’s. Maybe take a business class or two. You’ll start to learn that small percentage of loss across multiple revenue streams (movies, toys, cloths...) adds up quick. Projected earnings will take a hit. But, focus on your $18 argument.

1029 2018-03-05 16:59:00 But more than the weak correlation, what makes me feel that your argument might not be underpinning the rise in stocks today  - is that it's not simple enough for everyone to understand  & I refuse to believe that the market can be so rational, so early on in a trade war

1100 2018-03-05 16:28:06 We have movies as the best and economic entertainment but it should not be allowed to lead our lives to laughing stocks. Lot of stars are now MPs who have a misconception of interfering valuable lives of others who have world class conrtibutions.
1101 2018-03-05 16:28:04 Not an automatic weapon. BATF definition, not yours. I agree that bump stocks are stupid, but that was ATF’s fault.
1102 2018-03-05 16:27:51 That’s why 100 rd mags and bump stocks are really impractical. Way better off with having several 30 round mags and controlling shots. Reloading is pretty quick especially if you practice a lot and have some sort of belt/harness.

1104 2018-03-05 16:26:24 US stocks start to rise calming nerves..
1105 2018-03-05 16:26:15 Agree wholeheartedly with 1 and 3.

In case of 2, it depends on the stock, one needs to be very specific as you said. I hold 15 stocks, almost 10 of them above 40 PE. One needs to know the reason why market is giving them such valuation !!
1106 2018-03-05 16:26:10 US stocks start to rise calming nerves..

1123 2018-03-05 16:19:23 Assault rifles have been effectively banned since 1934. Bump stocks are not necessary to bump fire. And changing the age limits serves no useful purpose.

1128 2018-03-05 16:18:32 It's about the fact that quality is the defacto choice and prices for these will be substantially high. If looking for cheaper stocks which have been deemed to grow with upsurge in sector, the wait is not worthwhile. Looking for consistency in earnings is preferred, my thought

1130 2018-03-05 16:16:12 In bull markets, aggressive risk-taking is usually mistaken for intelligence. The challenge for these investors will be to hold onto those paper gains when the tide runs out. Resist chasing stocks at absurd valuations.Analyst reports are justifying buys based on FY20+

1137 2018-03-05 16:13:20 Google, Facebook, Twitter and others are publically traded stocks, most of us hold some of their stock in our 401K's.  They have zero right to put the weight of these corporations into censoring half the countries point of view.  When they went public they lost private privilege
1138 2018-03-05 16:13:08 1. Not universal background checks but whatever 2. No bump stocks and return of the assault weapons ban from the 90s as a starter
1139 2018-03-05 16:13:03 No guns until age 21. No bump stocks. Ban AR-15's & equivalent guns. Ban high-capacity magazines. Ban body-shredding ammo. Universal background checks. Universal registration. No guns for those on No-Fly list. BOYCOTT THE NRA & VOTE OUT ITS PUPPETS!!

1144 2018-03-05 16:11:35 I might have agreed at one time but not under current circumstances and admin sorry no. This does not address assault weapons, bump stocks, min age, closing loop holes. If they leave all that off the table now GOP will refuse to revisit bc of NRA pressure.
1145 2018-03-05 16:11:24 @DICKS Thanks, Edward Stack, CEO, for his public promise to stop selling assault-style rifles & hi-capacity mags, to raise min age for purchase to 21, & for reaffirming store policy to not sell bump stocks.

1168 2018-03-05 16:02:32 Tariffs on foreign steel will increase price of steel immediately.   How does this help lower costs for American businesses.  Why did Carl, Trump’s buddy, sell his steel related stocks prior to tariff announcement if its a money making move?

1189 2018-03-05 15:56:37 We also need stronger laws on obtaining guns, bump stocks need to be illegal, if we can't have automatic weapons why can we turn an semi automatic gun into an automatic weapon?

1220 2018-03-05 15:47:21 To be fair, bump stocks are needed for hunting  extremely dangerous beasts like 'squatch and yeti. These are often found roaming the trailer park prairie. You risk your life but they're damn good eatin'!

1228 2018-03-05 15:43:49 Beaufort insolvency has no doubt added an element of caution to the market in small stocks. Furthermore up to 20,000 retail investors having to sit and watch their stocks go up or down and being able to do nothing. Very frustrating to add to zero information at this early stage.
1229 2018-03-05 15:43:37 If I may agree with you in this way Ryan...?
Bump stocks are retarded. It’s a good way to waste 15$ in three seconds. They only have a tactical advantage if a hoard of zombies visit the house or your on the Chosin river and the Chinese come over the mound spray and prey
1230 2018-03-05 15:42:52 Sorry to derail - only broader observation is choppy stocks keep acting choppy - movers more consistent. Not sure if that's chicken or egg.

And why Washington does not include this number.
1233 2018-03-05 15:42:32 U.S. Stocks decline on President Trump's tariff headlines. Consumer Sentiment at frothy levels. Fed Chairman Powell says he doesn't see economy overheating.
1234 2018-03-05 15:42:10 That should make for a great day to follow Trumps twitter.  May want to sell all stocks before as he might escalate tarriffs to full trade war and shut down all ports, except for ship originating from Russia.

1239 2018-03-05 15:40:26 Stocks start lower as markets digest Trumps dumb tariff. It was most likely  him lobbing out the idea. Getting trampled and now adjusting to much less. It’s mostly just noise again. Rates came down and that’s good/bad.

1283 2018-03-05 15:23:33 Thorough background check on EVERY gun sale. Longer wait times, possibly 30 days in which to accomplish. Raising age to 21. Restricting sales as in Oregon’s Boyfriend Bill.

1441 2018-03-05 14:42:18 Did you know that 100% of crime happens in areas police say are crime-free zones? I’m happy gun violence is down 50%, how about school shootings/mass murders by gun? Are they down 50%? How about crimes using AR15’s, HC mags and bump stocks? Are they down 50%? 1/2
1442 2018-03-05 14:42:06 For parity, Carl Icahn should serve 58 years jail time, 58 years house arrest and 278 years probation since he sold 139 times more in stocks than Martha Stewart did.

1444 2018-03-05 14:41:52 The Trump confidant (Carl Icahn) has dumped millions of dollars into stocks just to destroy rival hedge fund owners who didn’t submit to his will. Icahn is notorious on Wall Street for scandalous market moves, the news shouldn’t come as a surprise

1456 2018-03-05 14:39:16 These fly-by-night or near-failure outfits used the hype of “blockchain” and the whole media razzmatazz about cryptocurrencies to manipulate up their stocks, sometimes by several thousand percent in a matter of days.

1482 2018-03-05 14:31:19 Surely it's just supply and demand. 

More homes should = falling prices (all other things being equal).
1483 2018-03-05 14:31:17 It's OBVIOUS to the most casual observer that you will NOT be putting up any new buildings any more since you ALWAYS used foreign (Chinese) steel in their construction.
Odd coincidence that your buddy dumped millions in steel stocks just days before you announced those tariffs

1490 2018-03-05 14:26:15 ok, no issues. Have you done this on Nifty500 or all the stocks?.
1491 2018-03-05 14:25:53 Securities and Exchange Commission SEC should be busy this morning. Obvious fraud will be easy to find. Look at who sold their stocks of Steel and Aluminum just before Trump announced tariffs on Steel and Aluminum.
1492 2018-03-05 14:24:58 i know what physical money is backed by. i know what my cashapp payments that i send are backed by. i know what my stocks are backed by. i don't understand what bitcoin is backed by lol
1493 2018-03-05 14:24:29 It's good Fidelity did this. Financial firms are way to conservative with their asset allocation funds. Losses don't matter. The market always recovers. You make more in stocks in the long run. Asset allocation funds should be overweight stocks.
1494 2018-03-05 14:24:10 With your announcements you are manipulating markets and giving notice to your advisors ahead of time to buy and sell certain stocks. This is insider trading you should be investigated for it.
1495 2018-03-05 14:23:47 Brilliant! Toyota stocks should go ZOOMMmmmm ENJOY M-
1496 2018-03-05 14:23:18 But you are calling for a ban on stuff that’s was already taken away from the public. Ban bump stocks I don’t care you can still shoot an ar15 the same speed.
1497 2018-03-05 14:22:28 That's the most painful part. You need to have thorough history of stocks that were delisted, name changed, merged, de-merged etc. And add/adjust all of this in the data to get the survivor-bias free data.
1498 2018-03-05 14:22:05 I am thinking to trade stocks from $5.00 -$100 because I see:

-Volume 
-Great News
-Bounce from big drops.

1525 2018-03-05 14:12:15 The economic calendar will feature the U.S. Labor Department's non-farm payroll report.  This jobs report will be closely watched after last month's wage increase played a part in February's inflationary sell off in stocks and jump in bond yields.

You literally don’t need ‘much contact’ when all you’re saying is ‘dump your stocks that depend on foreign steel.’  Only 45 Twitter characters. Only a few seconds to say.

1577 2018-03-05 13:49:02 Regardless if they bought stocks of not is irrelevant.  I work in the steel idustry and I can assure you we need a bettet deal.  If an official benefits at the same time I don't rightly care as long as Americans also benefit.
1578 2018-03-05 13:48:40 Stocks need to break down - particularly the Nasdaq imo - to get the metals and miners moving.  Metals are a big retail play and they still believe in the FANGS.
1579 2018-03-05 13:48:13 He's totally corrupt! He gave the heads up to his former advisor re tariffs who then dumped millions in steel related stocks. For this alone he should be jailed.

1585 2018-03-05 13:46:22 The US official who bought a bunch of steel stocks days before this was announced? Sure I dont know if that counts. But it sounds like the kind of thing where people should run around the place screaming about corruption or something.
1586 2018-03-05 13:46:08 Except it’s they who’ve had access to our territorial fishing waters for many, many years, decimating our fishing industry and then scooped up most of the fish reserves, selling us back our own fish stocks. Seems fair
1587 2018-03-05 13:46:06 @Carl_C_Icahn unloading millions in steel stocks before Trump’s tariffs? Inside trading much? The antics of the American government is horrifying and run by selfish Oligarchs. Land of the free?

1593 2018-03-05 13:43:46 I agree that before we turn our schools into fortresses, which will also be detrimental for children, we also work toward gun law reform. Universal background checks, ban bump stocks, hi-capacity magazines at least; ideally reinstate assault weapons ban; reduce hateful rhetoric.

1619 2018-03-05 13:31:07 The NRA is a civil rights organization that has generally been beneficial in its 150 year history.  Lately they are being too inflexible, however.  They should advocate some changes, like raising minimum age, ending bump stocks, and requiring background checks on private sales.

1624 2018-03-05 13:30:14 76% of the underperformance of R1000 value  over growth can be explained by just the FAAMG stocks !! So that is also very different this time around.
1625 2018-03-05 13:29:50 yes it would.
and maybe MSNBC and other public companies think this is a joke cause most of their stocks are locked in hedge funds, retirement funds, other "products" that allow handful of people to control all the corps.

That can change!

1629 2018-03-05 13:28:22 2/2 Soft target so arm all. Well arm all with bump stocks and AR-15’s. So the logic is arm instead of figuring out a way to keep people who can do the most harm away from these type of weapons. Yup, common sense.
1630 2018-03-05 13:28:12 Working on them? Lol sure they are. Kevlar piercing bullets are illegal to sell, not to own.  Wonder why they can’t even do that.  Anything can be 3D printed. Poor excuse on the bump stocks. Typical NRA. Nothing done. Nothing.
1631 2018-03-05 13:27:52 Yep. Kids all off to school  Roads clear so we can get out and about. Most importantly Bread stocks are at normal levels. 
1632 2018-03-05 13:27:16 I think that the banning of AR15, bump stocks and anything semi-auto IS THE COMPROMISE.  That's what the pro-gun side doesn't seem to understand.  The large majority of us would like to take all the guns, all of them.

1661 2018-03-05 13:12:40 Exactly.  They try to scare gun owners that their guns will be taken away.  Not true.  It’s banning AR 15s, bum stocks, raising the age to buy, addressing mental health in order to buy @NRA stop spreading fake news; stop starting people! #NeverAgainMSD

1665 2018-03-05 13:11:42 What America needs are Common Sense type gun laws.  The best plan is to outlaw all assault weapons and mechanisms such as bump stocks and high capacity magazines.

1673 2018-03-05 13:08:20 I think the news is being mighty generous when they say you did this because you were throwing a fit. I want to know how many of you dumped your stocks before you announced this. You are acting like you are saving a 100k jobs when in reality, you are going to cost 5 million jobs.
1674 2018-03-05 13:07:26 it's so laughable though, as if Icahn doesn't have enough billions to survive should steel and aluminum stocks drop for a little while.  Unless he shorted them, then he'd have made a shitload

1698 2018-03-05 12:56:54 Mr President, would you rather have Mexico’s economy over ours? The answer is obvious and so are trade deficits; we as a consumer economy should embrace trade deficits; your steel tax added $2.2 Billion to steel stocks mkt cap, yet the rest of sectors lost $395 B, who benefited?

1704 2018-03-05 12:51:26 We still would like to know where a #Trump confidante like Carl Icahn has such uncanny insight to dump steel-related stocks mere days before his friend, the #POTUS, announces tariffs. So coincidental.

1730 2018-03-05 12:26:44 Well, better stick with stocks. 

If I tried to go wine my only return would be disappointment at my lack of self-control, a good night, and a helluva hangover.
1731 2018-03-05 12:26:04 Not the time to do tariffs. Your going destroy the economy, stocks will crash.
1732 2018-03-05 12:24:29 Use the money to buy stocks! Still a gamble but the odds are much better and you can get dividends
1733 2018-03-05 12:24:11 Well done. Your normal levels of incompetence have been exceeded.  The removal of the need to provide stocks of permitted reserves for industrial minerals beggars belief. With Brexit on the horizon, how else are we going to safeguard the raw materials to supply British industry.
1734 2018-03-05 12:23:11 This IS the HUGE story that IS the cause of school shootings. News KEEPS getting baited to argue bump stocks and NRA cards to DISTRACT/bore the public into changing channel.

1741 2018-03-05 12:19:19 @Emma4Change Thanks!  Fight fire with fire & put a wee bit of fire under their asses: fund me - in six months to put AR15's bump stocks and ammo in kids 18 to 21 from gun shows in certain select congressional districts. unless congress acts. god willing use funds help gun victims
1742 2018-03-05 12:18:40 The truth is, even the military stopped using the AR15 or semi auto rifles. You’re using this argument to trigger enthusiasts. We simply want automatic rifles and semi auto rifles banned. Bump stocks too. The 2A was never intended to be unlimited.  But you’re too focused on $

1751 2018-03-05 12:08:22 Mutual fund boards of directors tend to be shared across funds in a family, and therefore, voting tends to be consistent across active and passive funds that hold the same stocks. And as Josh says, long-term holders care a lot about governance. 1/2
1752 2018-03-05 12:06:12 The stocks are continues to dwindle. Smh

1766 2018-03-05 11:52:50 I'm not an expert on stocks in the least, but I can't picture one scenario in which eBay's long-term investors profit from selling off the only part of that piece of shit business that makes any money or sense.

1769 2018-03-05 11:51:30 I like to keep my portfolio small, usually 8 - 12 stocks. Maximum 15. You're unlikely to achieve super-performance with a large portfolio. You end up working harder for less reward.
1770 2018-03-05 11:51:11 I read that one of your good friends dumped his steel stocks 2 days before you imposed tariffs. Trump is a crook.

1776 2018-03-05 11:46:01 People think Stocks are complicated, don't put all your eggs in one basket....You spend the $ several X over on daily gas station junk food and don't sell your shares just because the price drops a little...you don't actually lose the money till you sell the stock!

1806 2018-03-05 11:19:16 The government should allow councils to borrow against existing housing stocks and build new social housing home's. More than 50% of people can't afford to buy! Social housing is needed all over this country. The Government never mentions social housing!
1807 2018-03-05 11:17:41 Something important to note: many composite firearms won't register on metal detectors and x-ray machines. I don't know if that's true of the ones this company makes, but it's important. There have been steps taken to ban such stocks but I don't know if they are in effect.
1808 2018-03-05 11:16:49 When is her 15 minutes up?  I’m not sure,but it sounds as if this propagandist and fear monger is threatening to shoot me, for supporting the second amendment AND wanting to discuss sensible gun reform like background checks and bump stocks.  Not very American if you ask me.

1812 2018-03-05 11:12:49 Private survey data which showed deterioration in India's services sector activity last month hit investor sentiment. Also fears that Donald Trump's announced tariffs on steel and aluminum could spark a trade war led to sharp falls in Metal and Mining stocks. #MarketWrap

1820 2018-03-05 11:04:24 You actually are very funny. We loved your TV show. AND.......you are right about guns! I am not anti 2nd Amendment. I just want reasonable limits.....no assault rifles (a la AR-15), no bump stocks, license, registration, insurance etc.
1821 2018-03-05 11:02:50 it all started when the NRA gave the go ahead on bump stocks.

1823 2018-03-05 10:59:56 Yes, our fishermen have been reduced to catching the stuff that is less popular, but if we end the EU fisheries policy, restore our 200 mile limits, British fisherman can then start catching the more popular stuff, and I suspect maintain better standards of conserving stocks.

2131 2018-03-05 06:19:29 Another possible reason is that Nintendo is testing 9 year highs. Stocks don't move in a straight line and the same thing happened when NTDOY hit resistance at 40, 45, repeatedly bounced off of 50, and now again at 58.

2143 2018-03-05 06:03:21 Nintendo stock just closed trading here in Tokyo at -5.10%.

Possible reasons:
- current yen-to-$ rate
- ongoing lack of blockbusters in year 2 pipeline (for now)
- PS4 sales higher than Switch in Japan in Feb.
- general trend (almost all gaming stocks in Japan went south today)
2144 2018-03-05 06:02:26 Those are issues too, obviously. However the massive amount of guns is the main factor for why there is so many gun deaths. Ban bum stocks, limit magazine capacity too.

2167 2018-03-05 05:40:04 Gun stocks falter since Florida shooting is the White House to end AIDS fear losing ground under Trump.
2168 2018-03-05 05:38:02 Charles Cotton of the NRA is an idiot who spoke these words, & he's unlike most NRA members who want bump stocks banned, more inclusive background checks and a national database of them accessible to all gun sellers, a well-defined national minimum waiting period, etc. @DLoesch
2169 2018-03-05 05:37:20 That's a GREAT start but what i do is try to weed out the ones which i think will be tough to trade. For example, Retailers, Gold, silver or Oil companies are crappy to trade. I stick with MOmentum stocks so stocks like CSCO, ZBRA, NKTR will be good ones to focus on
2170 2018-03-05 05:36:49 I notice you're not addressing the issues of bump stocks or magazine capacity, which will turn one of those into a (more) lethal killing machine, even in the hands of an amateur.
2171 2018-03-05 05:36:41 Raising age limits is age discrimination, an excuse to let older adults get them, to get on a list you have to have a State mental hospital to report suspects, to diagnose 4 mental problems, fee's discriminate against the poor, only getting rid of bump stocks, will be a start.

2174 2018-03-05 05:34:57 I have accepted that 2018 will be a nightmare year for stocks just like 2015. I'm prepared for a long haul. Expecting fresh highs on Nifty & BN only after LS elections in May 2019.
2175 2018-03-05 05:34:51 Sir do you think this episode will impact Karnataka bank - one of your favorite stocks?
2176 2018-03-05 05:34:07 It's okay to hold but there are much better stocks than sail
2177 2018-03-05 05:32:22 I say take a page out of anti abortion groups playbook. Start with bump stocks, large cap mags, suppressors, and collapsible stocks.
2178 2018-03-05 05:31:00 The NRA is working on universal checks and a bump stock ban. Universal checks have state’s rights issues. The bump stocks can be 3D printed. Kevlar piercing bullets are already illegal. The gun show loophole has other legal issues. Dems are blocking gun violence data collection.

2190 2018-03-05 05:20:00 @DrewStegman923 where do you see junior mining stocks on ASX going in 2018?
2191 2018-03-05 05:19:05 Repeal Dickey Amendment, 3rd party review of fed/state/local response of incidents & tips, ban bump stocks, background check overhaul, mental health gun sale provision, SRO funding. Why is that not reasonable now? Even from the far right?
2192 2018-03-05 05:18:19 The BSE Sensex fell 252 points to drop below the 34,000 mark and NSE Nifty shed over 90 points in opening trade today on heavy losses in metal, auto, oil and Gas, banking and PSU stocks after US President @realDonaldTrump fuelled concerns of a global trade war.
2193 2018-03-05 05:17:56 Just wait to see if Icahn buys back steel stocks. That will happen just as they stabilize at a new low and just before Trump changes his mind...Hahaha! Then they will do it again next week!!
2194 2018-03-05 05:17:19 Stick to real news. 
Back to resource stocks.
2195 2018-03-05 05:17:07 Also as you know I am a conservative but I do see things we should do, like better background checks, raise age limits, no bump stocks, and even put a few restrictions on AR type weapons like higher permit fees. But attacking the guns their selves is not the solution
2196 2018-03-05 05:16:54 To me my Market continues to be specific only  to stocks under radar. I personally think at the risk of not being a regd advisor, things will be far better beyond a few days for many of these stocks. The journey will continue

2201 2018-03-05 05:07:26 It sounds like stocks will crash which will likely affect interest rates but I'm not sure how private assets will be affected. The value of a dollar will plummet since it's currently falsely high bc of govt inflation. If you own gold, SAVE IT! Cash out acts & buy nuggets!
2202 2018-03-05 05:06:32 And how much did you friends make by dumping their stocks in steel and aluminum.
2203 2018-03-05 05:05:52 I've been attempting to get some Mashiro and Minazou stocks in AiKabu for 2 days now but to no avail.
2204 2018-03-05 05:05:16 The offer lasts until the stocks lasts with the seller, request you to check out as soon as the product is added to cart. Request your understanding.
2205 2018-03-05 05:05:01 Yes, and items like bump stocks help those semi-automatic fire nearly as quickly as automatic weapons.

2221 2018-03-05 04:48:02 My read is they struck down the bill amendment to ban "assault weapons " but they left in the provisions to raise age limit and ban the sale or possession of bump stocks.

2228 2018-03-05 04:43:56 I dont have a problem with NRA in general.  I think its good we have something like that.  But i do think they have too much influence.  Easily if you a politicial just trying to say ban bump stocks, NRA will primary u.  Thats too much power

2236 2018-03-05 04:37:37 They’re against universal background checks,they won’t close gun show loophole,they won’t even allow the study of gun violence or collecting data.They won’t even ban bump stocks or Kevlar piercing bullets.They defend mental health to take blame off guns.They work for gun mfrs.
2237 2018-03-05 04:37:31 Rosa Parks didn’t sit in a bus so you could limit the second amendment by banning bump stocks . Or did you just prove your point incomplete

2286 2018-03-05 03:42:32 I am rolling a duffel bag aimlessly around the 42nd Street NWQR stop, wearing socks and stocks, a marching band shirt, light wash jeans, and a red Sox hat. The train is experiencing delays. This is how I want to die.

2288 2018-03-05 03:40:31 What summer team do u play for !
2289 2018-03-05 03:39:34 @KenCalvert said he wanted to ban bump stocks. That was months ago. Why hasn't he moved forward on this to protect his constituents?
2290 2018-03-05 03:39:15 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. 131
2291 2018-03-05 03:39:05 This might be a crazy ride. Cheap stocks, high value crypto, sounds like it's gonna be a dance between the two.
2292 2018-03-05 03:38:46 Why is the NRA not willing to hear anything from anyone with a different opinion? Can’t they even admit there is no need for bump stocks? Trump said he was for some gun control. Is that true, or did the NRA pay him off?
2293 2018-03-05 03:38:21 #NRA's time is running out.

The American people see them for what they are, terrorists.

The #NRA wants bump stocks legal, high capacity magazines, and no limits on who can buy guns. They fought hard to allow people on the terrorist no fly list to be able to buy AR-15 rifles.
2294 2018-03-05 03:38:04 keep it up Shree the torstar stocks are not low enough yet as they have not gone bankrupt yet but your articles will case more readers to flee the star thus loosing more advertising dollars for the star.

2298 2018-03-05 03:34:31 Are you out of your ever loving mind? There is absolutely no comparing a "ranch rifle" to the semis. Have you never heard of bump stocks? If you want to get into a pissing contest based upon your internet knowledge of firearms, I'm happy to oblige. I've loaded and fired a bunch.
2299 2018-03-05 03:34:06 U rite, you do take stocks mad early to be honest lol
2300 2018-03-05 03:34:03 Stocks have prices; Businesses have Values.
In the long run a stock has not life of it's own; it is only an exchangeable piece of an underlying business. If that business becomes good over the long term, it will become more valuable, and the price of it's stock will go up in turn
2301 2018-03-05 03:32:11 Why are you going to make us all pay more to buy things so that Wilbur Ross can get a good growth in his steel stocks?  We lose and Wilbur wins.

The #NRA wants bump stocks legal, high capacity magazines, and no limits on who can buy guns. They fought hard to allow people on the terrorist no fly list to be able to buy AR-15 rifles.

2308 2018-03-05 03:27:32 If you look at the polls, the majority of Americans want:
Age limit lifted
No bump stocks
Ban assault weapons. (Thin majority margin)
Stronger background checks
Waiting period
Better reporting
Hardened school shells

But the minority party (Dems) can't call a vote.
2309 2018-03-05 03:26:51 I DON'T believe Trump was in agreement with that; his idea to ban the sale of bump stocks, halting the sale of Assault Rifles while the LAWS are rewritten to increase the age limit for sales and enforcing strict background checks seems reasonable, maybe SERVICE Member exemptions.
2310 2018-03-05 03:26:17 It wasn't about Stewart trading her stocks. It was her lying about it and obstructing justice. Carl is being investigated. We'll see how that all turns out for him. Give it time.

2329 2018-03-05 03:12:35 Banning assault rifles, bumps stocks, over large magazines etc is NOT banning all guns. Hunters do not use those guns to hunt food, and you don’t need that much capacity to defend your home. Their only purpose is to kill humans.

2335 2018-03-05 03:07:13 Hmm. So only wealthy people own stocks? So you don’t have a 401k? Most middle class Americans don’t own a 401k? Buybacks increase the stock price thus increasing everyday American’s retirement accounts. But maybe you don’t know what a buyback is?
2336 2018-03-05 03:06:05 Companies paying higher dividends makes sense, but many buy backs in stocks are irrational at these valuations.

2340 2018-03-05 03:03:47 Also need to outlaw short sale of stocks. Betting on a company to fail is immoral and promotes price manipulation.
2341 2018-03-05 03:02:18 @realDonaldTrump Ban/outlaw bumpfire stocks. These were used in ONE [horrible] crime in 8+ years, now many people are afraid of them. Thus you will damage/close co's, & jobs, create criminals. Due to FEAR. Shouldn't we apply this std to all products?

2364 2018-03-05 02:48:02 Insider trading . . . Jail time! 
The offense is "insider trading,” wherein an individual buys or sells stocks by using non-public information given to them by the people of a company/government. Insider trading is not legal and is considered a serious offense.
2365 2018-03-05 02:47:46 Unless Icahn is just extraordinarily lucky, this is insider trading. It isn't a victimless crime. Although stocks are abstract some people bought those Icahn stocks. They lost a lot of money. Could be retirees and pensions.

2384 2018-03-05 02:34:03 Where's that Executive Order banning bump stocks? I would have that "soon" would have come, well sooner.
2385 2018-03-05 02:33:31 I think finding stocks with good chart setups is just the beginning of trading. Knowing when to get in and get out of a stock is another level. I was able to find "good" plays but I didn't profit out of them because I either didn't play the ones that ran or didn't buy many shares
2386 2018-03-05 02:33:12 I speculate the market (bonds, stocks, interest rates, &etc) will gyrate wildly. My thesis focused on chaos theory & fairly convinced our “setup” satisfies the criteria: exceedingly complex, very sensitive to small changes, and so forth. #ButterflyWings

2421 2018-03-05 02:19:29 Carl Icahn won last week. He sold his stocks before you announced the new tariffs on aluminum etc #INSIDERTRADING
2422 2018-03-05 02:19:23 Nice of you to tip off Carl Icahn about this.  He would’ve lost a fortune if he didn’t dump all his steel stocks 2 days before your announcement to the rest of us.  I’d expect a kickback if I were you.  Best wait until you’re out of office first though; you know, appearances...
2423 2018-03-05 02:19:04 Laughing stocks have no credibility

2426 2018-03-05 02:17:16 No one is disputing the market data right now. But to say “company x has great revenue so the future is bright” is entirely a misnomer. See: housing stocks a la 2006. Everything IS fine right now. And it will be most likely the next five years. But 10? 15? Maybe not.

2464 2018-03-05 01:55:17 The Washington state legislature has approved a ban on bump stocks.
Governor Jay Inslee has said he will sign it.
2465 2018-03-05 01:54:49 NRA still a terrorist organization. They do not speak for responsible gun owners. Wake up, America! The NRA is not your protector.  Ask them why they do not support universal background checks? Banning assault weapons?Bump stocks? High count magazines? Why not!?

2473 2018-03-05 01:50:36 Foolish response, particularly after Vegas and Parkland massacres. No more bump stocks or assault weapons (AR-15s, etc.). Common sense. #NeverAgain have killed kids in school.

2479 2018-03-05 01:47:04 US stocks ended mostly higher on Friday, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq erasing early falls as the market took a view that reaction to the tariff plans was  overdone.

2486 2018-03-05 01:39:24 Zero, none whatsoever. Explain to me why cities with strict gun laws have more gun violence than cities with CCW? Banning bump stocks won't solve a thing since handguns are used more often and people can make their own. Solve the underlying problems first.

2493 2018-03-05 01:33:16 I voted NO. @Ripple holds 60%+ of the #XRP, if anyone wants to support them, they can buy the token. If Ripple needs funding, they can liquidate some of the holdings. No stocks, no NASDAQ fees and most importantly it will create XRP liquidity: win-win.
2494 2018-03-05 01:33:02 Agree with you, wolf.   However, I am holding $sx atm.....I cautiously long highly speculative penny stocks (which, however may give you great profit when the sentiment is right...) $grat will do well tomorrow probably (I have no position though)
2495 2018-03-05 01:31:18 My God!! I feel like every time @D_Medinaa tweets the twitter stocks go up !!
2496 2018-03-05 01:30:37 You see no correlation between the number of guns and gun violence? There are not enough guns is the problem?
Lack of father influence, lack of school discipline, medication are definitely things that should be looked at.
I'll suggest 1 item: how about the ban of bump stocks?
2497 2018-03-05 01:30:32 Attleboro MFOL’s mission is to advocate for the abolition of high capacity, automatic weapons and accessories such as bump stocks that allow semi automatic weapons to fire shots in rapid succession (stimulating the abilities of automatic weapons).

2524 2018-03-05 01:11:57 “I think we should take guns away first and go through the due process stuff later” was a better joke.  What a cretin.  I’m now ok with Obama being President for life but hindsight is 20/20.  And Trump’s scandals have done well for my media stocks.   No joke.

2544 2018-03-05 00:56:19 sent u the history it was made for the military I know it's an semi automatic bump stocks make it faster I watched the video if ex military shooting it kills a lot of people in short time with extended magazines it killed 49 people in bar that's all I need to know they got to go
2545 2018-03-05 00:56:13 The former trump aide sold off all his millions of dollars worth steel stocks just one month prior to the announcement-- how convenient!
2546 2018-03-05 00:55:34 “you might not have signal when you get there”

2547 2018-03-05 00:53:07 xD que la mayoría de veces cuando un Díseño se satura es por la cantidad de renders en este caso es que esta saturado de stocks
2548 2018-03-05 00:52:43 Trading stocks too I see :)
2549 2018-03-05 00:52:23 gusto ko talaga nung trackpants na fog inspired kaso wala pang stocks 
2550 2018-03-05 00:51:27 Por supuesto que sí existe. Se relaciona con exceso de oferta que provoca caída generalizada de precios, aumento de stocks. Lo contrario a la inflación.
2551 2018-03-05 00:51:08 There is no reason for bump stocks to be legal
2552 2018-03-05 00:50:20 Is $thds part of the vip list? Thanks!
2553 2018-03-05 00:50:05 Fact check..True
Bump stocks were made for disabled people (but screw them right)
AR15 are great in the farm/ranch/home these are great for everyone including women 
Handguns are great for home&personal defense each caliber is different some like .22 some 9mm&.45 etc

2554 2018-03-05 00:49:40 In other news, Trump pal Carl Icahn broke the law to sell $50 million stocks ahead of tariff announcement... y’all think that’s just fine though, right?

2557 2018-03-05 00:47:39 Doubtful, since the new tarriffs is grt news for steel stocks, at least the US ones...

2559 2018-03-05 00:45:25 Too many garden parties - stocks need replenishing!
2560 2018-03-05 00:43:40 How many of your buddies dumped stocks in steel and aluminum just before you haphazardly decided to make this a priority? You really should concentrate on fewer things at a time
2561 2018-03-05 00:42:18 Still a good entry point?
2562 2018-03-05 00:41:29 Bump stocks.

2563 2018-03-05 00:41:07 Rappers are investing in stocks instead of diamond-studded chains 
2564 2018-03-05 00:40:54 To all the new followers:

Chartstravaganza runs on Sundays. The rest of the week is about stocks, markets, and stuff.
2565 2018-03-05 00:40:51 Stocks of steel companies have gone up in recent years. Your ideas of tariffs are idiotic at best.
2566 2018-03-05 00:40:45 Buttermilk keeps for ages. With stocks of flour and bread soda you could bake, and give yourself a real shot at the top job.
2567 2018-03-05 00:38:18 Ahem RT @NPR: A former adviser to President Trump sold off $31.3 million in stocks he owned in a steel-dependent company, just days befor...
2568 2018-03-05 00:37:13 Yes, but it is less convenient to obtain certain books than it is others. If you want to buy some unpopular literature, you can. Amazon might not stock it. But that doesn't mean it's banned. You just have to buy it from a seller that stocks unpopular stuff.
2569 2018-03-05 00:36:32 you congress person so that the defrauding stocks and bonds system has checks and balances in place and are enforced, tell how you are going to insure that the government has failsafe mechanisms so people like Madoff do not play with people's pensions, fortunes and all around
2570 2018-03-05 00:36:28 Your friend was so wrong sanjay. He must be a small time broker in a small city trading in agri stocks for a quick 2000 bucks. 
Don't take advise frm ur frnds. After all, they too are idiots as they are YOUR friends...!!!
See his prediction was so wrong 
2571 2018-03-05 00:36:08 See what your change did to the market Friday?  Also, when did you tell Carl Ichan about your plans so that he could dump all his steel stocks?  The levels of corruption are disgraceful in the trump White House
2572 2018-03-05 00:35:51 Sorry one of those stocks was $ WING
2573 2018-03-05 00:34:48 @Brianbricker4 do you trade stocks?
2574 2018-03-05 00:34:25 Why should bump stocks be banned?
2575 2018-03-05 00:33:54 Opinl lo mismo pero algo saturado de renders no sino de stocks mas bien dichomas iluminacion porque todo se ve con la misma propoeciones de iluminacion osea se supone que arriba sea mas claro que abajo porque la liz esta arriba
2576 2018-03-05 00:33:32 Was expecting a small bounce back in stocks this week after four days of steep sell offs, but Nikkei still tumbling (down just about 8% for year to date now).
2577 2018-03-05 00:31:39 Since I’m a self proclaimed stock guru now lol, I think now would be a great time to probably get rid of any stocks that may be affected by the Tariffs that will be imposed from other countries
2578 2018-03-05 00:31:28 Stocks Goin Up 
2579 2018-03-05 00:31:20 I think in foreign stocks you get more diversification benefit with developed small cap and emerging markets.
2580 2018-03-05 00:30:28 or looks at bitcoin and thinks he can trade stocks
2581 2018-03-05 00:30:26 @realDonaldTrump You are making a horrendous mistake tariff increases for steel & aluminum This is delicate process otherwise you cause mass unemployment in mfg of all things steel South Carolina makes cars increasing tariffs forces higher prices, inflation & decreases in stocks
2582 2018-03-05 00:30:13 Who's gonna investigate you for giving your buddies a heads up to sell their stocks? Your a crook #prisonbuttsexforPOTUS
2583 2018-03-05 00:30:07 just remember.....if stocks go south hard.....inflation grows/growth slows/Fed has to raise rates faster/debt service scares investors/ asset prices collapse/ recession ensues and deepens...2019-20.....you can say "hello MarA-Lago" I'm back
2584 2018-03-05 00:29:25 Wall Street will send stocks lower because if this. They're afraid people will actually have to be paid a decent wage again, and companies might have to accept a little less profit. It's called supply and demand...for workers. Pay what the labor market in the USA dictates.
2585 2018-03-05 00:29:20 I would agree to that and I'm right leaning. I find it laughable that they can't even ban bump stocks, unbelievable. But I would agree to that deal, I actually think a lot of Americans would.
2586 2018-03-05 00:28:57 Why are you "sorry"? You know this isn't going to happen, just like you won't sign an EO banning bump stocks. All talk.
2587 2018-03-05 00:27:57 I see nothing but WINNING and I am not tired of it economy jobs stocks 401  but when you’re looking for hand outs I guess you’re losing loser
2588 2018-03-05 00:27:54 Senator:  Are you aware that 50% of Americans own stocks as part of their retirement savings.  Stock buy backs raise stock prices which benefits average Americans too; not just the rich.  JM
2589 2018-03-05 00:27:49 Seoul stocks start lower on trade worries //app.yonhapnews.co.kr/YNA/BASIC/SNS/r.aspx?c=AEN20180305002800320
2590 2018-03-05 00:27:40 Investing in stocks IS a gamble especially if you invest of some "flavor of the week" type stocks...there are really solid companies like P&G etc that will always profit...every stock isnt a millionaire in a few weeks type deal feel me
2591 2018-03-05 00:27:30 Jacob, if you knew anything about stocks, you would know this screwed us and screwed US produced oil which favors Russian produced.
2592 2018-03-05 00:26:57 Trade develops gradually, not overnight, China wants more trade talks, we shouldn't fight with our allies either, we need to negotiate, stocks in disarray!
2593 2018-03-05 00:26:09 Things are sure looking good for your little buddy Carl Icahn though eh Trump. Dumping $31 million in stocks just a day before the new tariff changes. What's the laws regarding Insider Trading again?
2594 2018-03-05 00:25:09 You f'd up.  I'm retired and my stocks dropped after your uninformed announcement.  I'm also from an oil producing state. You are screwing my state.  Stick to real estate which you probably seem to be screwing up.
2595 2018-03-05 00:24:52 Why bring this up ?  Are stocks going to crash
2596 2018-03-05 00:24:51 Oh ok, gave me a big fright. I thought I have been trading Co stocks for a year under completely wrong impression and wrong readings into Co grades! 
2597 2018-03-05 00:23:29 My friends and I were on the winning side because we sold all our steel & aluminum related stocks last week. Just ask Carl Icahn!
2598 2018-03-05 00:23:22 Is this the reason that your friend sold his stocks?  Martha Stewart?  Lock HIM up!
2599 2018-03-05 00:22:13 I too own guns, yet I believe in responsible gun ownership, I'm against military style rifles, bump stocks, large capacity magazines, & people with domestic violence and mental health backgrounds getting a gun.  I am NOT a member of the NRA like 300 million other Americans.
2600 2018-03-05 00:21:53 The housing bubble that popped in 2008 was built like a house of cards. This propping up of stocks in the global market promises to be another house of cards hurting not only the US but global economies.
2601 2018-03-05 00:21:28 Better opportunity in small European stocks, probably
2602 2018-03-05 00:21:20 I reason not to ban bump stocks they’re honestly useless. If you talk with anyone whose spent time in the military they will tell you rapid fire is inaccurate and they wouldn’t want it
2603 2018-03-05 00:19:45 Isolationism will destroy our economy and reputation. But you are too a moron and won’t listen to good advice. BTW, you told your friends to sell Steel and Aluminum stocks before you mentioned the tariffs. INVESTIGATE!!!
2604 2018-03-05 00:19:24 Almost all guns are semi auto.  Also "assault weapons" is a disengenuous term which bans cosmetic features like pistol grips and adjustable stocks.  There's no functional difference
2605 2018-03-05 00:18:36 Everyday would wrote without sicc stocks ?!?
2606 2018-03-05 00:18:24 Stocks
2607 2018-03-05 00:18:08 How did Carl Icahn, your bestie know to sell his steel stocks the day before your trade war announcement? Doesn't this raise any flags with the SEC?
2608 2018-03-05 00:17:57 Yup. But, trolling for sympathy by playing victim is one of CNM’s stocks in trade. Especially aggravating is when someone says or does something deliberately provocative for the sole purpose of revving up the crazies, then cries victim when the crazies come after them.
2609 2018-03-05 00:17:07 hopefully 45s former advisor, Carl Icahn, goes to prison for dumping his steel stocks a week before Trump’s announcement
2610 2018-03-05 00:16:51 Great season kid.
2611 2018-03-05 00:16:20 Did You Know:
If you haven’t already sexually assaulted someone by the time you receive an Oscar, you have 90 days to do so or the award is melted down and turned into bump stocks
2612 2018-03-05 00:16:05 This article already closed 20% of the gap by simply raising the tax rate paid by the rich.  I don't know about you, but seems like low hanging fruit to eliminate 1/5 of the problem.  Then it is on to inheritance taxes. Market cap of stocks > 60 trillion. How much held by 1%?
2613 2018-03-05 00:14:55 Shame I don't work again until Thursday but I shall use this.  "Any other sources of income?  Sell any stocks, win at Foxwoods, goody bag at the Oscars,...?"
2614 2018-03-05 00:14:47 This should help you're rich buddies right?  Let's see how many people dumped stocks 2 days before this tweet.

2616 2018-03-05 00:13:06 1/1 Hi and thanks! Yes, I’ve read some of the things they are saying. Honestly, there are probably some good traders there, but there is a lot of people on there just attempting to manipulate stocks. My personal concern is that even if this stock ever makes it to the exchange
2617 2018-03-05 00:13:00 i don't like this move.
stocks will stumble in the weeks ahead.
2618 2018-03-05 00:12:08 I just wanna know how they do it 
bc they worried about designer if
someone teach me I’m buying REAL
shit like cribs , stocks, etc swear to god
2619 2018-03-05 00:11:45 I’m in a unique position as only otc penny stocks with dilution produce charts like uvxy and tvix... I’ve solely traded pennies for 5-6 years. Saw uvxy about to explode in January, just like a diluted penny stock, then saw spy crash. In charts like this, almost always a 2nd rally
2620 2018-03-05 00:10:28 @jimcramer Jim  True that Trumps buddy Karl Ichan Dumped steel stocks right before the Tariff announcement?  Remember Martha?  What a joke.  This Admin is a criminal enterprise. @joenbc
2621 2018-03-05 00:10:20 Once again, Donald J. Trump has proven he is not a friend of the American worker, but he is a friend of wealthy investor who bought a ton of stocks in companies foreign owned that stand to gain millions from the protective tariff scheme. Can you say kickback? Dump Don the Con!
2622 2018-03-05 00:09:51 It really meant nothing. Virtually no bump stocks were in private citizen hands in NJ.
2623 2018-03-05 00:08:25 don’t get how you’re meant to choose a mattress when the store stocks 500+ different varieties
2624 2018-03-05 00:07:37 So powerful to hear @Google EMEA VP speak at @AIPAC Policy Conference and explaining how #Israel is a global #innovation center for more than 350 global companies 

@BlueStarIndexes tracks these global companies and maintains a database of stocks with “Israel Inside”
2625 2018-03-05 00:07:26 'In 2014, packaging accounted for 6 percent of global oil use, 1 percent of the global carbon budget, and the weight of plastics in the oceans was about one-fifth of the weight of fish stocks.'

Yikes. Especially that last one.
2626 2018-03-05 00:05:36 Did you notice how tRump leaked information regarding upcoming tariffs on aluminum n steel. tRump’s friends were able to dump thei stocks prior to the tariff. How is that legal but they convicted Martha Stewart!
2627 2018-03-05 00:03:35 Hooo  ternyata level 'gila'nya sama kyk lawannya wkwk kirain yg gilanya begini2 akgae yh doangg, abis pas comeback YSF ama BU kyk biasa2 aja, ya paling masalah stocks diungkit pas mau BU .__.
2628 2018-03-05 00:03:07 Yup for selling about 250,000 worth of stocks.
2629 2018-03-05 00:02:35 I believe in tech analysis, but not to predict a market crash. I use it only to be on the right side of the trend. If stocks start to trend down on my timeframe, I’ll make adjustments, but not before that happens.

2631 2018-03-05 00:00:52 The @NRA has nor moral ground to stand on when it comes to gun control. The @NRA fought against banning bump stocks, fought for silencers and now fights for ARs . .  all putting #ProfitsOverPeople
2632 2018-03-05 00:00:25 Florida teachers’ pensions are in gun stocks. This should come as no surprise.
