So if the WSJ guy thinks that interest rate hikes are the proper and right thing to do. Then why wouldn't the stock market have that same thinking and stocks continue to go up. Obviously investors must think just the opposite.

If I don’t hit it because of the dip, it’s fine. I know it will go back up eventually. I’m putting ~$2050/mo in my 401k with match so it’ll all work out. And I’ll get some stocks on sale next week when it goes in! Ha
11 2018-10-11 23:53:36 it's cool sharesies, I'm not selling down US stocks because I'm panicking about a dip, I'm selling down because that's the closest I can get to shorting
12 2018-10-11 23:53:14 Wait, they were telling Trump supporters to buy stocks? With what?
13 2018-10-11 23:52:36 Then their money clearly isn’t being managed. I highly doubt that most people would still own the same stocks they owned 10 years ago.

40 2018-10-11 23:48:04 Honestly, I don't know much about Kanye's music. He's popular, so I guess he has some talent.
He should use his notoriety for better causes instead of a photo op with one of the biggest jackasses in history.
They've both become laughing stocks.
41 2018-10-11 23:48:01 Honestly very little.  Building a list of value and dividend stocks >200D SMA within 10% ATH’s that I’ll trim down until the correction settles, and work from there.
42 2018-10-11 23:47:53 Looks worst than February, looks more calculated and plan. A lot of money will be lost in options. Bulls will be shaken out, stocks will correct, then the bears will be trapped for a run after mid terms.
43 2018-10-11 23:47:34 Surely we don't go into 18/19 with 5.4 beginning stocks? All looks a bit dodgy
44 2018-10-11 23:47:09 No fear right now. All saying buy stocks. Expect an up open and a strong fade. It’s not as easy as oversold go buy.

47 2018-10-11 23:46:18 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to improve your depression
48 2018-10-11 23:46:06 by the way, i wish those stocks were promoted, just not yet thou. They will be! 
49 2018-10-11 23:45:45 Almost every person I’ve talked with that’s not an active day trader still owns the same stocks they owned in 08. I’d say more people rode it out than didn’t. Hell if anything they added to positions.

58 2018-10-11 23:41:14 it's the # of $NYSE stocks trading on an uptick minus the # of $NYSE stocks trading on a downtick. +1000 & -1000 are good bounds, altho it can get extreme or as in summer where we didn't have alot of +1000 or -1000 ticks.  there's also $TICKQ (for Nasdaq...i use +/-750 for that).

62 2018-10-11 23:39:22 I feel the 30+ seconds between games makes me want to just up the stock count, even if we raise the stocks high and every time 3 is taken we "restart" by SDing
63 2018-10-11 23:39:20 It sounds like your company is not investing in the right stocks. Maybe you need to check into that. Mine is doing great!
64 2018-10-11 23:38:46 “Now, of course not every single one of David’s stocks has been as successful as these incredible winners…but there’s no need for me to cherry pick returns…” - right after you posted a list of cherry picked returns 
65 2018-10-11 23:37:36 Do you understand how the stock market works? Stocks go up when people buy products from companies. Stocks go down when they don't. Tax cuts were supposed to kick start the sluggish economy. Looks like THAT didn't work. Next up? I'm betting a war.
66 2018-10-11 23:37:30 US long rates stabilizing, oil squeeze attenuating, Chinese junk bonds picking up, yuan stabilizing, US stocks near end of blackout period, and Xi-Trump just agreed to a G-20 meeting. Wouldn't want to be one of those record shorts in AUD ...
67 2018-10-11 23:37:22 Instead of this nonsense, why not  talk about losing Haley, the crazy West rant today, the falling stocks, the decimated Panhandle, etc...
68 2018-10-11 23:36:18 USPS jacket stocks just went through the fucking roof
69 2018-10-11 23:36:15 So #MSM narrative is 2 do some buying. Now there´s a difference between positioning 4 a market rebound & searching 4 a haven stock. I have said 4 along time the closest thing to a haven among blue chips is $AAPL which is actually not currently a FANG which are the rebound stocks.
70 2018-10-11 23:35:59 STOCKS MARKET INFORMATION:  Stocks declined 50% during 2008 stock market  crash before recovering many years later.  I was around & wish I  had not listened to my advisors advice about riding out storm  Could  have bought a lot more stock had I gone to cash with at least some $.
71 2018-10-11 23:35:21 Alex Wood looks like he's making deals, buying stocks, etc.
72 2018-10-11 23:35:03 I just hope there is a "rematch" function for practice purposes
Also my goal is always to win by as much as I can so I never their stocks away
73 2018-10-11 23:34:33 MSM is like sharks w/ chum in the water; you go after any bait thrown by Trump. Trump once said a President should resign if stocks drop 1000 pts in a day. They did. What happened to the remarkable NYT investigation about Trump, taxes & daddy's $$? Fuck Kayne West...Do Journalism
74 2018-10-11 23:34:13 Faculty people talking about investments, stocks, insurance, and stuff and homaygoodness i feel pressured 
75 2018-10-11 23:33:23 My guess would be higher rates help some and hurt others. Higher rates push pepl out of grwth  stocks and cyclicals and into consumer staples, and higher div stocks. Those more likely to be owned by retirees, however older indnds also own funds, lower markets = lower fund prices.

81 2018-10-11 23:32:15 Danielle why does every CNBC host basically beg some fed lackey to come out and comment to boost stocks?  We have been doing this crap for years, the market has been led by junk stocks, it ends at some point or gold has to go higher based on massive currency devaluation

85 2018-10-11 23:30:25 1/2 Thank you Thank you! I do a little bit of technicals, but I shy away from it because sometimes I dont get the same support/resistance levels as the pros... This is my key area to improve this year. My technicals skills are best employed in stocks.
86 2018-10-11 23:29:32 I was just trying to get the message out that the gains he brags about are all but gone for 2018. If we lose again tomorrow it will be gone. But I see some of the after hours stocks are trading up (not enough to recoup the losses though).
87 2018-10-11 23:29:28 If anyone wants to know why US stocks markets are tumbling, its nothing to do with financial reports. 
All to do possible NATO/political collapse of US/Saudi arms trade re Turkish consulate affair.

93 2018-10-11 23:27:35 The stock market took a big hit over the past few days. The Dow dropped 800+ points which is its worst day since February 2018. President Donald Trump blames the Fed for the high interest rates. Look to buy stocks now while their prices are low! #SUACCF18
94 2018-10-11 23:27:15 They steer an entire generation into cryptos, so stocks and their derivatives have less traffic, so of course a bond selloff can be staged and used as a reason to selloff equities. But whatever they said.
95 2018-10-11 23:27:00 Same. Happened on 2 stocks when I was trying to sell./buy. $EVN and $IVZ. Also, I get mysterious stock volumes appearing in my portfolio. Or suddenly I'm up $1.6M until I reload the platform because the price is 77c instead of 7c. for one stock.
96 2018-10-11 23:26:56 I’m beyond loss w/ this. What companies are trying to use telepathy? That sounds like raw, uncut, pure idiocy. If this is an honest effort w/ large budgets then it’s an absolute waste of resources and please put me down to short any and all of these companies stocks.
97 2018-10-11 23:26:27 Can they get naturethroid? Or ask if the pharmacy stocks a different natural manufacturer. Ugh, I hate when companies do this -- especially med ones!
98 2018-10-11 23:26:05 Just daily. Support probably means less amid carnage, heaps of stocks fell through support like knife through butter
99 2018-10-11 23:25:43 Bump stock ban up now, Lounsbury said he did not read bill, talks about 2nd amendment & bump stocks are not a weapon, Osten discusses her support for bill #CTPolitics
100 2018-10-11 23:25:42 @cvpayne Wonder how much taxpayers paid Lerner to attack Tea Party, and Comey, Strzok et al, to attack Trump?  Significant part of world stocks selling off are their factoring in reduced income from Trump slamming the door on their welfare, trade imbalance incomes?
101 2018-10-11 23:25:02 My stock portfolio is in all high-risk stocks. They more than doubled under Obama’s tenure and I was beyond happy about that.
102 2018-10-11 23:24:50 Ok thank you
103 2018-10-11 23:24:44 Thank you ! I am amongst those who ran out of stocks. 20,000 lippies is not enough for us Filipinas in PH for @mainedcm . How about 40,000-100,000 on the re-stock?
104 2018-10-11 23:24:17 Can u imagine if 15 yo me got to go to muse soundchecks and shit....I’d fuckin... pass out like every 5 seconds. Now I’m just like “yea yea cool. How are my stocks doing.”
105 2018-10-11 23:23:25 Not sure what attachment to use on ARs and SMGs.
Quite confused with the Grip 2 and Stocks 2 etc
106 2018-10-11 23:23:16 Selling now just locks in your losses. If you are invested in stocks with solid underlying fundamentals,  ride it. History shows that those who sell at bottoms take far longer to recover than those who hold.
107 2018-10-11 23:22:56 Bump stocks anyone?
108 2018-10-11 23:22:52 I'm urging all Pres Trump supporters to do all their Christmas shopping now, before the election. That punishes liberal stock dumpers trying to tank the economy to affect the election. Profits go up, stocks increase in value
109 2018-10-11 23:22:35 WEW. 
Somebody give this kid an economy lesson. 
Teach Suzeeeee here what the fed is, what it did for 8 years under Obama to keep the economy from destroying itself, and how now it is fixing things under a strong economy. 

Don't worry, kiddo
The stocks are going to be fine.
110 2018-10-11 23:22:35 @jimcramer: Thanks for street rationality tonight.

114 2018-10-11 23:20:57 We are right there with you. Stocks don't really affect the economy. He is a liar. He is tearing our country to shreds, just like he did to his own businesses.
115 2018-10-11 23:20:47 Stocks aren't coming back, it's a 2,000 point drop. My bell got rung.
116 2018-10-11 23:20:43 Hope you go off on Vince losing a billion on stocks. So much for the "they're making more money than ever." Excuse.
117 2018-10-11 23:20:43 There have been warnings in the past couple of months that stocks would undergo an adjustment by how much and for how long is the big question.
118 2018-10-11 23:20:25 So based on what you just sent me, the top hit six trading days ago, we’ll experience an eventual bounce, then you intend on selling all the stocks you mentioned before, before the eventaul Wave C, right?
119 2018-10-11 23:20:00 @LamboJohnny can you tell me about the chart on $ati $ati.v just wondering if its going to break.....soon. You are the "king of stocks" please tell your paid followers, I'm sure they are dying to know. Looking forward to your response, or $sns. Same same! #joefraud
120 2018-10-11 23:19:43 
Perhaps it's because bans are what gun-control & gun-safety folk keep talking about and pursuing.

Bump stocks, magazines over 10 rounds....banned.

Gun-safety groups need to hold classess & range trips to make safe-handling a habit & encourage the use of safes.
121 2018-10-11 23:19:28 But Jim is wrong and who am I to call him that. But facts are valuations have peaked to an unsustainable levels even for value stocks. When value stocks are valued as growth stocks we should all get worried that fund managers are bananas.
122 2018-10-11 23:19:01 U must be in the top 1%. Have you not looked at anything other than fox in the past two days. Stocks are falling big right now!
123 2018-10-11 23:18:54 I think it’s funny how these tech stocks are up after hours bc CNBC says to buy
124 2018-10-11 23:18:54 Dam stocks are at a all time low since 8 months ago !
125 2018-10-11 23:17:47 Of course not everyone.  But all along I had been thinking, I have no stocks...then I realized, doh - I do  Meger for sure, but lots of blue collar workers have retirement pllans, it makes the situation somewhat bearable.
126 2018-10-11 23:17:39 A few stocks looking dirt cheap now... REA / CSL to name a few.  Looks like APX & A2M are two that investors have identified as hit too hard!
127 2018-10-11 23:17:04 Coinbase should have developed a mobile trading platform with zero fees. i think they lost a lot of customers to robinhood where you can trade crypto & stocks side by side without fees for crypto.

129 2018-10-11 23:16:40 ahh so they are talking about the jackpot lotto hahaha. Pag ako nanalo? Ipapadala ko mga Oshi ko sa Japan. Ipapajoin ko sa world senbatsu. Babayaran ko na rin marketing campaign ng MNL48 dito sa Pilipinas. or bibili ako stocks ng HHE para maging stockholder ako. hahaha dami
130 2018-10-11 23:16:33 at some point we're going to track the FMAGA stocks (facebook, msoft, amazon, google, apple) and donald trump will update his cap to reflect this new moniker .. no prizes for guessing what the F will then stand for!
131 2018-10-11 23:16:21 Religion is literally one of the reasons we struggle so much, can u imagine if the 10% we give every Sunday was put in savings or stocks or hell just to bills.
132 2018-10-11 23:16:18 I had a funny feeling @ChrisStigall might want to talk about stocks.  Can't wait!
133 2018-10-11 23:16:16 You love stocks
134 2018-10-11 23:15:12 Time for a tax break for the rich friends of trumpty who lost money on stocks
135 2018-10-11 23:15:08 Shorts much harder than buys in stocks, especially in lower volume names— if simply for the fact that shares are hard to borrow.
136 2018-10-11 23:14:46 ....although I wouldn’t mind seeing Bergevin put in the stocks and placed in the entrance of the Bell Center one game night....along with Geoff Molson!
137 2018-10-11 23:13:47 To be honest, even people who do have stocks right now are feeling the pinch. Seen the stock markets over the past two days? It's times like this I am glad I DON'T have stocks.
138 2018-10-11 23:13:38 I own 5 of them as defined by California law. Two AR-15s, one MAK-90, one G3, and one Mini-14 with a folding stock (those without folding stocks not considered CA assault weapons). They were grandfathered in January 1st, 2000.
139 2018-10-11 23:13:24 Happy to have @Delta stocks today! #StockMarket
140 2018-10-11 23:12:55 @jimcramer which stocks in the red on pensions will benefit from rising interest rates
141 2018-10-11 23:12:21 If people ever asked why the market moved up, say what I say: “people wanted to own stocks.” It it’s down, “people didn’t want to own stocks as much.”
142 2018-10-11 23:11:57 #kanye Stocks start dropping....
143 2018-10-11 23:11:52 Threw all my stocks into savings last week.  Waiting for after the mid terms. Lrg cap-Small cap-Global and Emerging markets are down across the board. #SafeHaven
144 2018-10-11 23:11:48 Stocks aren't supposed to go up every day even if we like 
them too. The DOW was at 6666 in 2008 vs 25000 now. A little pull back is normal as is interest rate normalization. Rates have been too low for too long. Ask a retiree.
145 2018-10-11 23:11:13 Children cannot be poor. In reception, they cannot hold interests in bonds, stocks, shares, gilts, land, etc hence cannot be judged for their individual financial affairs/lack of such.
146 2018-10-11 23:10:58 MSCI Asean fell 2.1%

Psei still not cheap, but it's tradeable! 

America's Rocky October  especially in election years

Stocks tend to do very well after midterm elections.

Pullbacks are normal

Fed bashing that's Trump

Nasdaq enters Momoland
147 2018-10-11 23:10:57 STOCKS:  Declines in stocks historically have preceded economic downturns by about six months.
148 2018-10-11 23:10:40 Long GOLD and POT. China stocks about to RIP in my opinion. Lots of opportunity out there. BABA exploding at the end trading up in after-hours.
149 2018-10-11 23:08:51 In the OranguTrump era, the safe bet is IPOs and precious metals. Currency, blue chip and stocks....
150 2018-10-11 23:08:36 Right but that’s your shopping list if those stocks hit that prce, correct?
151 2018-10-11 23:08:12 The dumping of stocks can be linked to the powerful billionaires with vendetta against Trump! My personal opinion!
152 2018-10-11 23:08:07 INFORMATION FOR THOSE WITH 401Ks:  there is NOT a penalty to move your 401K investments from stocks within your 401K plan to the money market WITHIN your 401K account.   Most 401K advisors want you to sit through dstock market declines, but if you are nervous you can go to cash.
153 2018-10-11 23:08:05 Time to buy stocks?
154 2018-10-11 23:07:55 On the live stream tonight please ask questions in the chat box.  Anything from trading hourlies, dailies, weeklies, or monthlies to vwap questions to looking at certain stocks.  Happy to share what I've learned!
155 2018-10-11 23:07:21 With volatility so high, stocks don’t trade cleanly. Need to focus on the market itself, it will be the leading indicator in other names. I plan to focus on the market leaders cause when money flows back in these names benefit first.

157 2018-10-11 23:06:55 I know someone has said this before but I am going to repeat. People who run for public office should have no stocks or investment. People who serve in public office should not be millionaires!
158 2018-10-11 23:05:24 Prediction: People are selling stocks AND bonds to set money on the sidelines. Anticipating short-lived market-driven dumping on 10-Yr T-Bill to < 4.3%. Money will go in to bonds bringing them back down to around 3.3%. Expect T-bill dumping near-term. DOW will drop < 1500.
159 2018-10-11 23:04:42 @realDonaldTrump Your killing the stocks n the housing market - thank goodness you got Kanye west on your side - what a Joke - I guess he’s the American Dennis Rodman - Right ??  I’m  embarrassed to be Republican
160 2018-10-11 23:04:28 EU has led the way in so many environmental initiatives from preserving fish stocks to climate change initiatives.
161 2018-10-11 23:04:13 I agree Hills I have lost around $11Bn in US technology stocks from the same hackers targeting Russian computer systems that are under financed and heavily dated stirring up terrorism!!... Careful I am watching you all and I am about to hand over the counter hack evidence!!...
162 2018-10-11 23:03:50 Hope sell off has end !! Bargain prices right now most stocks undervalued !
163 2018-10-11 23:03:49 I was thinking the same thing. Only thing up is gold and silver last time  I checked . Stocks plummeting crypto plummeting and everything else.
164 2018-10-11 23:03:35 The SNP got a right going over education. They should have had Swinney in stocks and supplied rotten fruit and veg.
165 2018-10-11 23:02:19 Looks like it'll only be a modest fall in Australia today judging by the first few stocks trading - BHP up 0.9% and ANZ down 0.9%. My early guess, ASX 200 will open down less than 1%.
166 2018-10-11 23:01:45 Fml I lost $200 in stocks in one week
167 2018-10-11 23:01:30 Domain Name Wire: Domain name stocks haven’t been immune to the market rout. It’s been a rough week in the stock market, especially yesterday and today. The NASDAQ shed 4.7% in the past two days. There aren’t that many publicly traded domain companies anymore on the big exchang…
168 2018-10-11 23:01:30 @CNBC @jimcramer Why is that you guys never talk about bears and stocks to sell? Stop discrimination!
169 2018-10-11 23:01:19 The economy is not about to crash. Yes, Trump is terrible, but stocks are down due to an increase in interest rates.
170 2018-10-11 23:00:35 D’ailleurs va falloir que j’aille refaire mes stocks chez @palaisdesthes, j’vais encore claquer un gros billet sans m’en rendre compte
171 2018-10-11 23:00:32 Money will change to cashless over time.  I was hoping crypto could rise as stocks drop, nah it does not seem to.  In any case as I've been saying, my plan is to short the markets once the drops happen and not play with crypto unless we get a total bull market in crypto
172 2018-10-11 23:00:23 I’m middle class and I’m in the stock market. The bloodbath affects my holdings, but no enough for panic. Once the selloff is over it would be a good time to add stocks for cheaper than they are worth. I’m holding and just going to keep working. I been teaching myself to invest.
173 2018-10-11 23:00:02 Most things will prove to be cyclical. #forex #stocks #cryptocurrency #markets

Also, please explain why income based on selling stocks is taxed less than regular income?
176 2018-10-11 22:57:56 *Stocks tanking
*64% saw no salary increase
*Gutting medicare & SS

If you think Trump is better than Obama, you're a racist.

180 2018-10-11 22:56:55 And has Kayne West in Oval Office using Vulgar Lanaguage and talking like someone who is mentally ill and crazy.  While people in FL lost everything.  The priorities of the GOP has come to a new low.  Nice Act - but not vital right now with STOCKS PLUMETTING.

184 2018-10-11 22:55:48 Could it be the rich Democrats are selling off all their junk stocks to create a crash so they can blame it on the Republicans and Donald Trump in the midterms! Desperation tactics!
185 2018-10-11 22:55:40 Has anyone besides myself seen how the Dow has dropped nearly 1400 points in the last few days. It could be because of rising interest rates and overvalued stocks. The smart money will wait for stocks to tumble then buy low, play the waiting game and sell high. Could be a sign.
186 2018-10-11 22:55:05 Bonds not providing much offset during this equity pullback but, since 9/20 peak, high-quality bonds (BB Agg) still outperforming stocks (SPX) by 6.5%.
187 2018-10-11 22:54:52 You may not need to own stocks to understand it but you need to be informed. You can’t disregard information entirely and then decide your opinion is still valid.

190 2018-10-11 22:53:53 @Vanguard_Group something is wrong with VGPMX (metal miners). All its top stocks are up around 6% today, but it is down 0.13%! The equivalent Fidelity (SGGDX) is up 5.57%!
191 2018-10-11 22:53:43 I spoke too soon, took a hit today! I could be wrong but looks like a great time to take a position in watchlist stocks which are heavily discounted now.
192 2018-10-11 22:53:41 @Janet4OH @seanhannity @CNN  We have Mexico Bch, FL wiped out and you are worried about this Conspiracy Hearing - which NO ONE cares about and YOUR President entertaining Kayne West using vulgar lang. in the Oval Office.  STOCKS FELL AGAIN!  You are a real Mess!  Resign and Leave

194 2018-10-11 22:52:57 Oh really?Jobs 4whom? Stocks? I don’t recall any outstanding stock results in Obama’s terms. Now I do recall how they SKY ROCKETED immediately after Trump won the Prez on the following day of Nov 9 Economy? Obummer would  some recognition 4 this. Read up on that one Not Obama’s
195 2018-10-11 22:52:57 Does anyone else think the stock exchange is dumb / not understand stocks
196 2018-10-11 22:52:55 There are $6tn of bonds owned by foreign interests. If there is a loss of confidence in the $, owners will cash in and buy stocks, not gold as no one will want to sell gold in $. Stock market will bounce back with vengeance before it collapses.
197 2018-10-11 22:52:54 What stocks should I buy rn?
198 2018-10-11 22:51:49 Can’t worry about the crybaby liberals, they have to act this way since the economy is doing great, regulation are less, trade deals, ppl making money on stocks 401k, lowest unemployment for blacks and whites! They have no agenda to run on except fake outrage and ignorance
199 2018-10-11 22:51:44 Elite HEDGE FUND companies Control HUGE BLOCK$ of money & move it in & out of STOCK Market 'AT WILL' & make HUGE PROFIT$ by 'shorting' the Market &then DRIVE STOCKS DOWN as last 2 days. HUGE SCAM. America's 401K's=big loser w/MSM-Fox saying "Market Correction". *SAME in SEPT 2008
200 2018-10-11 22:51:03 As I posted on my Twitter account this week when GOLD was $1,190 an oz, I posted FANGS stocks can bubble but GOLD cannot GOLD now $1,220 an oz that's how you invest $100,000
201 2018-10-11 22:51:02 Bizarre to say the least, ICE dominated by Algo/HFT and can disconnect for periods. Their is a chance the Turkish/US spat is settled Tomorrow, that plus losses in US, Hail replanting in OZ, a much lower crop in India (over 1 MB below USDA) and still lower stocks could form bottom
202 2018-10-11 22:50:57 People say “common sense gun control” but then offer no definition of what that means. Ban bump stocks? Ok. They aren’t that useful anyways. Assault weapons ban? Do you mean automatics? Because those are already highly highly controlled.
203 2018-10-11 22:50:54 Thats the way to suck up 401k
Giant corp invested in their own stock to raise stock price than sold it when price was  right
Guess who bought all those stocks
Our 401k managers
Who lose money now
Us. common hard working people
They will suck last remaining drop of blood out of us
204 2018-10-11 22:50:53 Is the Bull dead? I mean stocks are way overvalued.

206 2018-10-11 22:50:30 So mad about SQ. Had a few stocks last year at $30, sold them at $50.
207 2018-10-11 22:50:02 @Invest420 Do you know what happens with IIPRs relation and contract with PharmaCann in this? Uneffected business as usual? I own stocks in IIPR, but Im not aware of the jurisdictions in these kind of acquisitions.

212 2018-10-11 22:48:25 The first honest piece of info from an economist that I’ve seen in years! Reminds me of Shiller’s conclusion about black Monday: stocks went down because lots of people were selling
213 2018-10-11 22:48:25 Callin all investors in China stocks sell it for the cause
214 2018-10-11 22:48:18 Don't forget groceries are going up too. I'm not making anymore and I can't afford stocks
215 2018-10-11 22:48:12 Someone wrote an article sometime around March about stocks plummeting in the fourth quarter alongside the cryptos but, the cryptos wouldn't be down for long. They'll be the go to guys to make money for Christmas.
216 2018-10-11 22:48:10 Stocks and economic data is the most empirical data out there, all I see here is anecdotal data.
217 2018-10-11 22:48:04 Investing 

1. Stocks
2. Startups / Ideas
3. Properties
4. Cryptocurrency
5. Anything @elonmusk @Apple @SoftBank and @stripe backs, buys or invests in
218 2018-10-11 22:47:16 You understand that private party sales don't require a background check? That we still produce high-capacity magazines? Drum magazines, flash suppressors, bump stocks, optics...all legal, all created as offensive weapons.
219 2018-10-11 22:47:00 Well while Scott was out & about pimping Prosperity, Australian stocks lost $110B, that is $110B since he b/c PM as his economic chickens come home to roost. As ABC respects white male fragility they probably didn't want to upset him any more.
220 2018-10-11 22:46:48 Is it possible to invest in specific stocks or at least in a specific area? I know about he wealthsimple thing but I'm like 72000th in line 
221 2018-10-11 22:46:33 This could be a major bottom. Looking at $EEM, it has declined for ~10 months and global stocks are now negative for the year at -4+%. 

Therefore, we could see a synchronized surge in global equities. As mentioned before, we expect a prop sell signal in q1/q2 of 2019 in $spx
222 2018-10-11 22:45:46 So..... stocks b cheaper today.  Why the long face? No $$$ on the sidelines to out to work?  Rookies.
223 2018-10-11 22:45:12 I’m having a hard time deciding on what stocks to buy. Do I buy more shares of stocks that I own (Canadian stocks). Or do I buy new US stocks that I’m interested in? Tough decision! What do you guys think?
224 2018-10-11 22:45:00 Yea i want to see this week plays out and whats the markets sustained reaction to the bond rate increases... some stocks that dipped this week recovered today like AMRN...
225 2018-10-11 22:44:52 Off topic but if the stocks continue to plumbit it gives Democrats a huge boost for November

227 2018-10-11 22:44:01 Stocks help the wealthy, so.
228 2018-10-11 22:43:54 why googling for "supermicro stock" doesn't bring the stock graph over the last day like it used to do a week ago (and still doing for other stocks)? Same goes with specifying the ticker.
229 2018-10-11 22:43:47 Sun screen stocks are about to explode.
230 2018-10-11 22:43:30 "SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED UPON". The AR-15 is no more deadly than any handgun, and certainly doesn't account for near as many deaths as any handgun. Bump stocks just waste ammo too. No reasom to ban the AR-15. Plus assault rifles are already banned.
231 2018-10-11 22:43:03 I pondered saying the perfect trade was a train stock but couldn’t think of how to include it. My Mom’s favorite stocks are trains.
232 2018-10-11 22:42:56 Stock market plunged 1,300 points in the last two days erasing $1.3 trillion in value. Could you imagine what Donald Trump, Republicans and Fox News would have been screaming if this was under Obama? Instead, nothing. Total Silence. Sold my stocks last month #PrepareForRecession
233 2018-10-11 22:42:52 "SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED UPON". The AR-15 is no more deadly than any handgun, and certainly doesn't account for near as many deaths as any handgun. Bump stocks just waste ammo too. No reasom to ban the AR-15.
234 2018-10-11 22:42:29 You miss the point: Of course it's rubbish. But Mr Morrison claims credit for budget repair which is a reflection of unexpected strength in iron ore & coal prices: Policies have actually added to the deficit. Yet no responsibility for stocks? It was meant to point out that folly
235 2018-10-11 22:42:27 I want every child to be a wanted child and every mother a willing mother. No one should ever be forced to bear their rapists child.

248 2018-10-11 22:39:49 I wouldn’t doubt if the stocks dropping and the fed scaring people with raising rates is a nevertrumper insider attack to hurt The Midterms ! They dont care about anything but gaining the power back !

250 2018-10-11 22:39:05 I knew this was coming but didn’t do anything about it. We are personally too heavily invested in stocks.
251 2018-10-11 22:38:28 No Problem!! I only hear good things and from different ppl. So may be something great!! Sorry I don’t know more. Stocks not my kinda thing!!
252 2018-10-11 22:38:12 I bought stocks at the end of Bush, about triple in value now .... buy I sold them after a year. I’m hypothetically rich
253 2018-10-11 22:38:09 not worried.  My stocks have never been so high since we got President @realDonaldTrump !  America needs to thank him for many good things he has done.
254 2018-10-11 22:37:59 My Canadian marijuana stocks are doing great
255 2018-10-11 22:37:50 Well that's a selection affect clearly caused by the fact the right wing elites are keeping quiet while holding onto their oil fund investments and the stocks heavily dependent on them. They do of course preach the gospel of  fossil fuels and climate change denial.

Ouch.
257 2018-10-11 22:36:28 STOCK DECLINE:  Some economists say "you haven't seen anything yet"...China is down 23% in last six months, Europe is down 11%.  US stocks are up about 3%...so we have a lot of catching up to do.
258 2018-10-11 22:36:26 buy some stocks, they're on sale right now.
259 2018-10-11 22:36:13 Hey @MSNBC why no reporting on Trump attorneys answering Muellers questions via paper. @cnn. Enough of this Kanye. It’s Trump distraction from this topic, stocks & #JamalKhashoggi murder. When will you learn?
260 2018-10-11 22:36:01 Time to pick up some stocks out of the bargain bin.
261 2018-10-11 22:35:47 This guy I work with saw my watch and clothes and asked if I was a drug dealer ( as a joke ) lol I told him yeah of course. Gave him about 5 seconds to get all the bad thoughts in his head before I told I buy a sell cannabis stocks 
262 2018-10-11 22:35:20 FT stocks to begin it's rise again from Tomorrow. #buy
263 2018-10-11 22:35:09 @CBSNews Why is Kanye news. What value does it add. How about a conversation adout global warming.  Stocks. Gas prices. Anything
264 2018-10-11 22:35:00 Pretty sad that stocks going up means little to any but the rich but when they drop, it hits the rest of us hardest.

266 2018-10-11 22:34:21 He made stocks plunge today
267 2018-10-11 22:32:56 Yes that is exactly what that chart means and it was used by Wall Street as a positive b/c 84% of stocks are owned by the top 1%
268 2018-10-11 22:32:34 Heard someone reasonable on @CNBC today saying to their panel of interviewers stocks could fall 40-50 percent to get to “fair value”, panelists heads nearly exploded.  “What you are saying, it’s just, it’s impossible!” Oh the power of narratives.....
269 2018-10-11 22:32:20 To me, the recent break out in ylds doesn’t make a compelling long case for bonds and especially not stocks, but the one asset that does get a huge boost in long term appeal given the big picture context is gold.
270 2018-10-11 22:31:45 If hip hop promoted education and a healthier lifestyle how dope our generation would be, in stead of buying those labels they’d be buying stocks and cutting down global issues.
271 2018-10-11 22:31:20 I WISH there would have been an albino elf stock! Stocks are getting better though. Sloooowly.
272 2018-10-11 22:31:14 Stocks on Sale! Get em while their hot!
273 2018-10-11 22:30:58 You probably understand stocks better than those who deal in them.

Its trade relies on people being stupid enough to buy too expensive and sell too cheap.
Don the Con tries to make ppl do one thing and China the other.
274 2018-10-11 22:30:33 I am looking to add hard to my silver and gold positions tomorrow morning as well as other commodity plays. The harder stocks fall, the more certain of a Fed easing which means USD crashes and metals explode.
275 2018-10-11 22:30:24 @TedWilliams2017 it will take most people that had investments in stocks 3 to 5 yrs to recoup what they lost.
276 2018-10-11 22:30:14 Thoughts on cannabis industry stocks?
277 2018-10-11 22:30:08 Interesting that so many folks blames rates rising for the sell off yesterday yet today $tlt shot up and rates came down...yet stocks still got sold. Lot of market noise this week. What say you Michael ?!
278 2018-10-11 22:29:58 Companies fail all the time, the bigger they are they harder they fall too. I suppose it depends on whether we talk tech stocks in general, or the stocks of the individual companies in that group
279 2018-10-11 22:29:41 What he means is that CEOs cant wait for earnings season to hype up their stocks so that they can unload these overpriced stocks in the subsequent buybacks to your pension funds
280 2018-10-11 22:29:35 US stocks were rallying in Aug & at ATH’s & yet we still had int expense > tax receipts. US equities unequivocally aren’t solving the US deficit problem, & a 10 yr equity bull mkt proves this. A better argument can be made that misallocation of capital worsens the fiscal picture.
281 2018-10-11 22:28:38 A great time to buy stocks
282 2018-10-11 22:28:37 Some company's like Bethesda retain majority ownership of their stocks, so they have the privilege to release games at their own pace, preferred budget, able to sell risky games at their leisure, while publicly traded companies have to  answer to investors, and lack these perks.
283 2018-10-11 22:28:30 American companies are the largest source of demand for American stocks, and sharp tumbles have come when their buying slows.
284 2018-10-11 22:28:07 @AskRobinhood hey, I have been trying to sell my stocks since Tuesday. I really need some help because something seriously wrong with my account!
285 2018-10-11 22:27:30 Well the Republican Congress DEFINITELY is at fault for this artificially pumped up market. Trump is also at fault for that horrendous tax monstrosity that's been nothing but a vehicle for corporations to buy their own stocks.
286 2018-10-11 22:26:51 This is my family also,no stocks paycheck to paycheck. And we won't live on credit,so it's walking a tightrope every month. There are more people like us than not sadly.
287 2018-10-11 22:26:31 American companies are the largest source of demand for American stocks, and sharp tumbles have come when their buying slows.
288 2018-10-11 22:26:20 American companies are the largest source of demand for American stocks, and sharp tumbles have come when their buying slows.
289 2018-10-11 22:25:14 I think all of those stocks are buyable right now but could get cheaper. I'd like to see $CACI in the $150s.
290 2018-10-11 22:24:55 Certain people will lie to you by equating a strong stock market with ordinary Americans doing better. 40% of stocks are owned by foreigners and 90% of Americans do not own one share of stock.
291 2018-10-11 22:24:07 It seems 100% unanimous in my stream that stocks go up from here and that was a short term bottom.
292 2018-10-11 22:23:40 Who hit that UNDFT drop?  

Nexus knew they didn’t drop all the stocks. 
293 2018-10-11 22:22:32 When Do #MarginCalls Kick In Driving Markets Down Further?...This Was Supposedly a Highly Leveraged Market...Especially in the FANG Stocks... #msnbc #foxnews #nytimes #cnn #wsj #cnbc #politico #huffpost #drudge #bbc #gop #npr #dailykos #thehill #wapo #nbc #cbs #aarp #eu #ecb #nyt
294 2018-10-11 22:22:30 Excellent point. The stock market is only a economic indicator for those who can afford to buy stocks.
295 2018-10-11 22:22:27 Right?! My stocks dropped to 2 something!
296 2018-10-11 22:21:47 A majority of American households do own stocks though, 54% in Gallup's latest poll on the subject.
297 2018-10-11 22:21:29 Interesting that my health-care stocks are holding up the strongest during this market sell-off.  $MOH, $CNC, $ANTM, $WCG, $PGR  (Ya, I know $PGR isn't in health care, but it's holding strong with the rest of the insurance names so I included it here.)
298 2018-10-11 22:20:51 My love life is trash af but at least my stocks are doing good though

I just buy motorcycles instead.  Probably not a great financial solution ;)
302 2018-10-11 22:19:28 Your statement is totally incorrect . Beto believes in gun control or gun reform. Democrats r not anti 2nd amendment. They believe that assault weapons such as machine guns and accessories such as bump-stocks should not be in our streets.
303 2018-10-11 22:19:23 6 straight days stocks have dropped my money lookin funnnnnnnnnnnnny in the light lemme fucking tell ya

305 2018-10-11 22:18:37 Jesus, stocks are a fucking bloodbath right now. How’s that trade war, Donny?
306 2018-10-11 22:18:17 Stocks are on sale today!

309 2018-10-11 22:15:26 Y’all own any stocks or is dat jus me?
310 2018-10-11 22:15:23 USD for sure. Don't get me wrong Amazon and Apple and the likes are great companies but they can't keep going up forever. -20% + in the cards for a lot of stocks. IMO the equity blood has just begun
311 2018-10-11 22:15:22 I got less conservative. I have stocks now and am wary as hell.
312 2018-10-11 22:15:00 Hahah my stocks are okay, just trying to help out by hunting on foot.
313 2018-10-11 22:14:30 @realDonaldTrump Raising interest rates 8 times in one year, is election meddling. Who is doing the meddling, that's the question.

Are companies getting inside information on stocks that will report tomorrow?
314 2018-10-11 22:14:28 Historically overvalued stocks + rising interest rates + tariffs + increasing energy prices = stock bubble burst

320 2018-10-11 22:13:00 Yes! A man that went bankrupt on casinos when casino stocks rose 250% should be directing central government monetary policy!
321 2018-10-11 22:12:47 Entrepreneurial Stocks Continue to Tumble, but Market Bullish on Lingerie
322 2018-10-11 22:12:39 The stock market has been falsely inflated for the past year by corporations buying back their own stocks because of the huge tax cuts they received. Now that it dropped 800 pts yesterday, Trump has been trying to save face, getting Fox to encourage people to buy stocks.
323 2018-10-11 22:12:23 How phony is the US market? Everything is great! But we can't EVER normalize rates again, because then everything won't be GREAT. Leave the FED alone Cramer, they know what they are doing--even if it means stocks GO DOWN (OH the HUMANITY!)
324 2018-10-11 22:12:18 STOCKS and ECONOMY:  If you went to store to buy something, and owner called insulted you, you would find a different place to shop.  That's what trump did with China and others.  That's why stock market is falling.  Economists realize US companies are going to lose business soon
325 2018-10-11 22:12:09 Stocks hold two-plus year uptrend. Deep oversold level suggests #stocks have seen a near term bottom.
326 2018-10-11 22:12:08 I’ve heard weed stocks. I think 2 Canadian Companies u can invest in. Ppl keep telling me they are making a lot of money, I have to invest. It the best thing they have done.  
I’m like u tho. No idea. Maybe worth a look into too :)
327 2018-10-11 22:11:36 Shit's heading lower, y'all. So many stocks have more downside to come.

329 2018-10-11 22:10:53 Is that what is happening with stocks today.
330 2018-10-11 22:10:48 Think the stocks are not related to the items on impacted by tariffs
331 2018-10-11 22:10:27 GREAT TIME TO BUY CERTON STOCKS PAY ATTENTION,YOU CAN DO WELL !
332 2018-10-11 22:10:01 GS is correct.  The speed of rates rising and the 5y poking 3% putting the whole belly flat, all while buybacks paused = stocks die, but he matrix for yields and inflation isn't the most straight forward thing in the world.
333 2018-10-11 22:09:54 Almost totally liquidated. Feel mixed emotions. So much work goes into picking the stocks yet perhaps it is an opportunity to reallocate into what is working and will work moving forward. Or buy back in at lower price points. Mike, looking for your watch list chief??
334 2018-10-11 22:09:41 Soon we'll all know how correlated $BTC and stocks really are.
335 2018-10-11 22:09:22 Hellz yeah, let's blaze it up and chill.   Who cares about talking stocks for a day. And drink some corona since they bought so much of them.  I think I have a perfect movie to watch when we get high ...  lol...Girlfriend hurt me so I need to chill.
336 2018-10-11 22:09:17 Are we going to be burned at the stake? Or put in the stocks? What are they thinking? 
337 2018-10-11 22:08:37 Again: You're saying Trump gets no credit for rising stocks but gets all blame for falling stocks. Right?
338 2018-10-11 22:08:31 All the US money should be coming here. Dirt cheap stocks
339 2018-10-11 22:08:31 Its coz they slide in to yours as I remember  or your stocks 
340 2018-10-11 22:08:27 looks like the fucking tsla stocks

342 2018-10-11 22:07:49 Stocks are falling for the 2nd day, employees @Ford are facing massive layoffs due to tariffs/trade war, the #FloridaPanhandle just got leveled with the largest #hurricane ever to hit that area and @realDonaldTrump is spending the day with #KanyeWest #ThursdayThoughts #NotNormal
343 2018-10-11 22:07:00 In 1998 during the asia crisis i watched 8 analysts down grade all their stocks 2 days before the bottom. We have had no yoy negative earnings revisions
344 2018-10-11 22:06:54 Amazing. He got the interest rate hike done to prevent a bubble from forming, and then dropped the news of this G-20 meeting with Xi.  Stocks are already recovering. 

THE MAN IS A GENIUS.
345 2018-10-11 22:06:15 This implies all stocks are overvalued. Absurd.
346 2018-10-11 22:06:14 $maestermate whatever you send it going straight to stocks, ill send your money back and more
347 2018-10-11 22:05:47 I wouldn't say he was bashing anything. It doesn't take a genius to see that tech stocks are overvalued. One day they will crash and they wont bounce back
348 2018-10-11 22:05:30 So why do you block legislation that would enforce the laws (Assault weapons) or the spirit of the laws (bump stocks). And don't get me started on 3D printed guns. @NRA only cares that more guns are sold, not safety or legality... #NRAHatesAmericans #NRAHatesKids #NeverForget
349 2018-10-11 22:05:21 Today is a good  day to invest in stocks. Opening higher tomorrow most likely.
350 2018-10-11 22:05:14 I expect profit taking tomorrow so we may see a #Stockmarket rally.  Do NOT buy into any 1st rally from lows as this is #SHORTSELLERStakingPROFITS.

354 2018-10-11 22:03:58 @Cfloyd20 can I safely apply this logic across various FAANG stocks today?
355 2018-10-11 22:03:56 We only want a ban on the assault rifle and the bump stocks. Not a ban on guns in general. People seriously need to read what the whole cause is for before they pretend to know what they’re talking about. Don’t question Jamie if you can’t give the right interview
356 2018-10-11 22:03:46 Guy Adami, Bj and the chair woman don’t know much about the stock market get more traders like Mr Steve Grasso and it would be nice if you fools spend more time talking about stocks instead of politics
357 2018-10-11 22:02:19 Activity in pot stocks has fallen off a cliff as cube gamers shift attention to volatility ETFs.
358 2018-10-11 22:01:29 I’ll help you out. Replay what you did with AMD - company with history, young minded CEO, low price, stock shot down due to factors other than incompetence, and mainly, the ability to mimic other stocks that are much higher priced (nvidia, intel, micron). Next time sell faster.
359 2018-10-11 22:01:10 Not much you really need to understand, buy Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, or Google. Amazon great too but each share is close 2k. Don't worry about ups and downs these stocks are great long term investments.

368 2018-10-11 21:56:31 The market always goes up and down Vivian, you know that and mostly it's Tech stocks that are capping off the losses with temporary fear. When the Holidays start roaring with sales, you'll see what happens.
369 2018-10-11 21:56:10 I hate stocks that go down 40% on no news
370 2018-10-11 21:56:01 What a shock people sold stocks.
371 2018-10-11 21:56:00 Hey Republicans it is your patriotic duty to prop up these falling stocks, find the lowest performing stock you can and buy the price back up! #MAGA
372 2018-10-11 21:55:42 It dropped even more in February and rebounded. You know why I am glad the dpw dropped? Because it is cheaper to buy stocks.
373 2018-10-11 21:55:17 Market Close: MBS +19bps; DOW -545.91; NASDAQ -92.99; S&P 500 -57.31; 10yr Treasury 3.15%; Stocks continued their freefall, as Mortgage Rates gets a little boost.

376 2018-10-11 21:54:34 Other than maybe twitter or snap most tech stocks have a reasonable valuation.
377 2018-10-11 21:54:18 Agreed! I enjoy how Tim teaches because he’s very direct and he’s very real! He knows his stuff! I’m excited about it!
378 2018-10-11 21:54:15 They will only be laughing until the next US Federal deficit print or perhaps the one after that if stocks don’t rebound.  Owning sovereign debt is historically a bad idea when that sovereign’s interest expense is > tax receipts.  US was there in Aug (int exp + pay go entitlemts)
379 2018-10-11 21:54:06 No no no. You don't "fully" support something if you have exceptions against it. "Oh I fully support it, just no "assault weapons" or bump stocks." Tell me, what is an assualt weapon? I can assault someone with my composite bow! Is it...an "assault weapon?"
380 2018-10-11 21:53:22 Meh. It’s October. Historically not a great month for stocks. And if you’re patient and consider this a buying opportunity, there’s money to be made down the road.
381 2018-10-11 21:53:12 Here in US they always give some sorry excuse to raise gas price to make profit on oil stocks and bank accounts and I don't where your oil supply comes from?  And owers comes from Alaska and split off to other lines and priced that way.->
382 2018-10-11 21:53:09 ALL OF IT. BITCOIN IS THE NEW SAFE HAVEN  ... not but dude was saying something along the lines of, gold is catching a bid, bitcoin is dropping along with stocks.... “so much for ..” .. I’m bias and do think eventually bitcoin will be the safe haven. Think it’s a bit premature
383 2018-10-11 21:52:29 Makes sense, I added in premarket today, I was up for the day. Stronger stocks held.
384 2018-10-11 21:52:29 U.S. stocks rose an average of 12% a year during Obama’s two terms, according to S&P Global.

Obama's 3rd among the 12 Presidents since World War II, based on the performance of the S&P 500. Only Bill Clinton's 14.9% a year and Gerald Ford 18.6% presided over better markets.
385 2018-10-11 21:52:28 Stocks hurt today 
386 2018-10-11 21:52:23 She basically says that being for better background checks and waiting periods and bans on assault weapons and bump stocks is not the same as being anti-guns.
387 2018-10-11 21:52:20 Should we just assume that Trump thinks that Soros is selling off stocks to make the economy look bad before the election?
388 2018-10-11 21:52:07 Allogene’s IPO says one thing to me: no one has learned a damn thing about due diligence.  I’ve not heard anyone talk about the risks — it’s all rainbows and glitter.  If this keeps up, the biotech stocks are likely to tank big time again.
389 2018-10-11 21:52:00 Maybe if you'd educate yourself on stocks and investing you'd have more $$. Your Grocery Bill statement is beyond misleading and unbelievable esp since inflation isn't that high and grocery stores which are low margin are unable to pass on increases that fast or that high.
390 2018-10-11 21:51:33 I'm going to go with Stormy Daniels, her  bestseller has caused people to sell their stocks to get a copy.
391 2018-10-11 21:51:32 As much as I want to say it’s because WWE produces crap it’s mainly because the stock market as a whole is down and more Tech stocks which are in the Nasdaq (-2%)which I believe WWE is in for some reason.
392 2018-10-11 21:51:25 AM Mkt: #Corn +6; #Soybeans +6; Winter #Wheat -2. USDA surprises with reduction in YC yield to 180.7bpa. Slight increase in YSB yield to 53.1 bpa, however trade was overcooked to the downside with higher yield ideas. Ethanol report showed higher production & increase in stocks.
393 2018-10-11 21:50:53 How phony is the Chinese market? They don't want that 2,500 level breached so they will put some money to work and halt some of the worst stocks...
394 2018-10-11 21:49:41 @TinaAlverson best info & tools out there, love the No BS approach. Stay disciplined as I am working so hard to do.
395 2018-10-11 21:49:27 That's right. In the long-run, a diversified basket of global stocks & bonds tends to reward those who stick to their plan despite periodic market volatility.
396 2018-10-11 21:49:11 It's all ogre now... buying gold stocks selling everything else
397 2018-10-11 21:49:06 Crazy market today! I need to adjust all my scanners if this keeps up!

398 2018-10-11 21:48:49 Do you have a 401K (403b etc.) or a 529, or life insurance policy?  You own stocks if you do.
399 2018-10-11 21:48:40 LMFAO yall are fools!!!! this is just the beginning of the storm. EXPECT the worse financial crises in our lifetime... Stocks will plummet 50% of its current value.
400 2018-10-11 21:48:30 Assets. Profit. Market share. Should I go on? Tech stocks have companies behind them with balance sheets and P&Ls. Pretty easy to value, actually. $BTC’s value is entirely speculative. Get over it.
401 2018-10-11 21:48:01 Amen Tim, study is key. My STT was down first thing so was patient and studied, not rushing anything.
402 2018-10-11 21:47:46 Forget this money-grabbing institution. As a millionaire (technically), I can teach you all you need to know about business in one tweet. Here it is: money. How do you get that money? By saving money. There are only two things worth investing money in: fine clothes and stocks.
403 2018-10-11 21:47:41 Noo I have some shares of stocks so that’s bad for me lol
404 2018-10-11 21:47:10 TTWO and ATVI with big, imminent catalysts but so expensive compared to the Japanese gaming stocks. For TTWO are you worried about RDR2 cannibalizing high margin microtransactions for GTA? Game sales low margin compared to those transactions (til RDR gets it going too)
405 2018-10-11 21:47:08 “So much for Bitcoin replacing Gold as the safe haven for when stocks go crashing” is the dumbest fking statement I’ve seen on Twitter today.
406 2018-10-11 21:47:06 @realDonaldTrump @presssec @senategop @housegop @WhiteHouse so journalist killed, people dead in FL (oh they can’t watch), stocks fall 1300.  And YOUR FOCUS ON MENTALLY ILL KANYE AND EXPERT IN NOTHING. @LindseyGrahamSC GOT TO BE KIDDING.
407 2018-10-11 21:46:43 If stocks were where they should be, hooking 3 to 4 fish a day is not a difficult task......this year and last it has been more difficult but during peak week early July still pretty easy to do if one spent 8 hrs on river
408 2018-10-11 21:46:43 @APompliano, what would you better hold - tech stocks, or USDs?
409 2018-10-11 21:46:18 Uranium stocks are holding very very strong relative to the overall market. Just goes to show we are at a point where no one is looking to unload and we are in the beginning of a bull run. Love days like these, more time for me to accumulate my favorites $WUC $DML $LAM $FCU
410 2018-10-11 21:46:07 Still looking for good penny stocks... hmu
411 2018-10-11 21:45:12 News flash: if you don’t have a 401k and don’t own stocks then don’t sweat it. You have nothing to lose.
412 2018-10-11 21:45:03 Now I think viewers just like jerking Guy around. Many stocks are oversold.
413 2018-10-11 21:44:46 Maybe the correction reflects what stocks are really worth.
414 2018-10-11 21:44:20 LOL - nah. I studied Italian for awhile. The latest issue is out in couple hours. Some of the stocks I recommend were up anywhere from 10-25% today

417 2018-10-11 21:43:44 dnt jump down my throat bc this is a serious ?...but does investing in stocks make u money??
418 2018-10-11 21:43:28 When stocks drop the 'media' blames Trump, either directly or by association.  When stocks go up, the same media credits Obamna.  But... WHO IS DOING THE SELLING, BEFORE 11/6/2018. . .   WHO WILL BE BUYING, AFTER 11/6/2018. . .
419 2018-10-11 21:43:19 We may not own stocks but our retirement accounts are all wrapped up in the stock markets.
420 2018-10-11 21:43:18 I think the market was overbought and will continue to sell off more, but I'm seeing some decent values. I've been a buyer the last couple of days. A lot of the government contractor stocks have sold off, not just $VSEC.
421 2018-10-11 21:42:59 Just buy puts to hedge your stocks....
422 2018-10-11 21:42:45 Let’s just say 20 years of bull market and everything is about 70% overpriced. All this printed paper has no real backing. The S&P is constantly gaming the market by changing its stocks.
423 2018-10-11 21:41:43 Traditional investors were screaming about how overvalued crypto was for the last 18 months.

Wait till they realize how overvalued tech stocks are 
424 2018-10-11 21:41:43 I understand. I have some stocks my brother left to me when he died in January. I don't understand it either, but I lost a couple of hundred last month and will take a hit this month, I am sure. But I notice it at the gas station and grocery store too.
425 2018-10-11 21:41:10 If Christine Blasey Ford or Taylor Swift we’re stocks, they’d both be called Pump & Dumps. 

Ford by the Dems and Taylor by half of the music industry.

427 2018-10-11 21:40:34 If you do any business with large corporations, a bank, have a public pension, or are employed, you indirectly own stocks. They'll tell you that when their investments improve, you will benefit, but over the last 40 years, they have enlarged their fortunes while you haven't.

433 2018-10-11 21:39:13 Well, I am quite elderly. I retired at a time when people were told to invest in stocks. Which is not much help. So relying mainly on soc Sec. Is a joke , knowing that DT is trying to dissolve it. 860 a mo. Means every penny counts on a fixed income.

444 2018-10-11 21:35:28 Yep, she’s just like me. Stocks are a portion of my retirement. I was being a bit sarcastic. I was hoping somebody would quit spouting off about the Fed and putting the fear into everybody.
445 2018-10-11 21:35:25 If you are talking about @SRuhle ---Histrionic female buffoon is spot on! She should stick to picking loser stocks for Jim Cramer's foundation.
446 2018-10-11 21:35:21 You get no respect as an economist when you cherry pick data to fling feces. BTC is clearly different in kind from the rest and has a long-term chart that looks a lot like the shapes of the most successful stocks/companies historically.

456 2018-10-11 21:33:28 I don't think 2007 is a useful example.

2008-09 was severe recession but rapid equity recovery. 

2000 was mild recession but stocks didn't recover until 2013 and returns CRUSHED by simple treasuries.

I'd wager the next recession is more like 2000 due to starting valuations.
457 2018-10-11 21:33:13 Stocks extrêmement faibles (comme prévu selon les rumeurs) : Pour te donner une idée LDLC va recevoir (sur toute la France !) seulement 200 CPU. Du moins le premier batch du 20 Octobre.
458 2018-10-11 21:33:07 I thought this said "socks" not "stocks" and it was a hard to reconcile the rest of the tweet! Here in Australia petrol has been $167 for weeks now.. so insane.. (these days 'normal' price we are used to living with is around $130/litre).

461 2018-10-11 21:32:46 Jeppe C fra ATP har gennem flere måneder argumenteret ganske fornuftigt for, at US stocks og speciel techs var urimeligt højt prissat. Så jeg er ikke overrasket. Ligger 75 pct. kontant 
462 2018-10-11 21:32:43 Two things to know about stocks: buy low, sell high.

466 2018-10-11 21:32:04 Not thanks to him tho which is where its misleading. It takes time for these things to take effect. Stocks just took a horrible dip yesterday and it probably had nothing to do with trump or obama. Trump hasn’t done much for the markets. Do better research

470 2018-10-11 21:30:24 my stocks all dropped that’s amazing what day is this the best day ever probably
471 2018-10-11 21:30:11 This is what I was saying earlier today. I don’t own stocks, no 401k. I get the feeling because of this we don’t matter, unless you are upper middle class or above your opinions are nothing.

476 2018-10-11 21:29:16 Yeah, my first many years as a trader I lost money, stupidly, while trading.  Started off great, bought bank of America, wells Fargo, Ford, many others at rock bottom prices.  Then lost it all getting tempted STUPIDLY into gold and silver markets and penny stocks.

489 2018-10-11 21:25:03 Guy on TV: “Sure, you want passive on the way up, but you want active management on the way down.”

If you get to pick, I’d go with cash or bonds when stocks are down, but that’s the thing - you don’t know when things will turn.
490 2018-10-11 21:24:56 Back in 2008 i was just using Facebook and Myspace.
It was more different and we didn't really talk about finance or stocks over there.
It was a niche i guess.
491 2018-10-11 21:24:26 There's 2 reasons for this:
1) The republicans in toss up elections can campaign easier. They know they will lose the house, but they still have a chance to save the senate.
2) The stocks are falling. Things are starting to slip. if something happens, they can say it wasn't them.
492 2018-10-11 21:23:56 Yesterday it was Tech stocks, it is the democrats that are calling for mob rule & confrontation, kicking that caused a pause, now oil as people are seeing how Muslims have over run the EU and most countries want out!! Civil war not good for markets.
493 2018-10-11 21:23:53 How many FOX viewers even have the means to buy any significant stocks or really know anything about doing so.  These are your average to below average Americans.  They can't even discern truth from lies.  IOW, they are Trump's uneducated and likely to remain so.
494 2018-10-11 21:23:43 Like I've said, @realDonaldTrump , stocks have no place in my world!
495 2018-10-11 21:23:26 Zoom out...see that long term rising wedge on the $BTC chart from 2013-14  to next few years?

Short the end of wedge, exit all crypto and move to stocks for an year or two. 

Kthx.
496 2018-10-11 21:22:27 Market guru  Peter Schiff is right.  When ANALyt are telling you tech stocks are "safe havens" you know the end of the market boom is near
497 2018-10-11 21:22:13 I find it amazing how quickly people forget that twice in this century the Nasdaq had two 80% drops from their peaks. And the SPX dropped I think 55%. 40% to me seems rather ordinary. Stocks fall 40% in a recession. So it could be worse. I believe it will be.
498 2018-10-11 21:21:42 Sounds like someone checked his 401k (or other investment mechanism) recently. As with everyone, it's worth checking which stocks are feeding one's retirement income. ROI from the makers of bombs being dropped in Yemen perhaps?
499 2018-10-11 21:21:28 The lord doesn't buy gold or stocks he is currently on his ark... running like a ....
500 2018-10-11 21:21:22 That terrible situation where the US economy is so strong investors are moving their money from stocks to much more profitable US bonds.
501 2018-10-11 21:21:20 In individual stocks, are your charts adjusted for dividends?  If so, in what manner?
502 2018-10-11 21:21:19 PASSIVE 401K Investors; I feel bad for passive 401K investors. Thanks to republicans, stock advisors no longer have to do what is in the best interests of their clients.  401K investors are being told to "hold on" to their stocks while smart money is getting out of the market
503 2018-10-11 21:21:14 Im not surprised u and u equities held their own. In time I think the they will benefit as new money will pour into #uranium. Stocks that have had a good run will be disposed first. Dogs like our beloved U3o8s wont as theyve already received their beating.

528 2018-10-11 21:13:12 You’re right to worry about stocks declining,  but Ron has been saying saying it over a decade. Case of clock being right twice a day.  I switched 20% of mutuals to bonds when 45 began imposing tariffs,  so it won’t disappear like 2008|9,  it’ll just lose value cuz inflation.

535 2018-10-11 21:12:06 And through all of this, we had to endure hearing "store of value" for "havens" that have worse vol than penny stocks, and "new payment method" for systems that struggle to process 0.0001% of Visa's daily transactions at a multiple of the cost.

So they're out of 93% of the rec market. The reason pot stocks have huge market caps is b/c of potential rec sales. $N can't participate

597 2018-10-11 20:56:49 So the stock market takes a dip. What to do? Don't shift your stocks to money markets. Keep your stocks in the market. With a dip in the market, your 401(k) money taken from your paycheck, will buy more of the shares of your funds, because those funds are cheaper due to sell off.

Oh, and BTW:  This has been on the edge of happening for years now.  It's long overdue.
612 2018-10-11 20:52:38 Agreed. I don’t think the stock market is a good measure of the economy. Maybe is a broad sense — “enough stocks are being bought.” But it doesn’t indicate whether 5% or 75% of the population are buying those stocks. Right now the wealthy are doing better, the middle class worse.
613 2018-10-11 20:52:35 It’s a fantastic achievement, especially considering our current batting stocks. You even watch cricket?

620 2018-10-11 20:50:41 Tomorrow is Friday, don't be surprised to see ZB start getting bought at 7am CST and then grind higher all day long.  It's: 1. the day before a weekend (usually a slight bid b/c of that) 2. with stocks really weak lately 3. We're coming in from low levels in treasury prices.
621 2018-10-11 20:50:41 GDX +6.6% GDXJ +6.3%  Sure better than tech stocks today Both ETFs and Gold underowned while NASDAQ still over owned  
622 2018-10-11 20:50:30 Same is true about the stock market. 10% of Americans own 90% of the stocks. Top 1% own almost 40% while bottom half of families have less than 50k in the market. So whether the Market goes up or down it has little impact on most people.
623 2018-10-11 20:50:29 how about the double standards with the French boats blocking british fishermen, or the spanish boats killing the white fish stocks within british waters. Europe’s quest to kill off the british fishing fleet.

627 2018-10-11 20:48:33 It's not strictly inflation if you don't buy newly produced goods. It will cause asset prices to increase if the G injects demand for more stocks, say. This will also enrich existing stock holders
628 2018-10-11 20:48:11 Sep 10-Place a buy order to buy December Coffee at 98.50 a pound. Stay long the Yen. Stock market very nervous and dangerous to enter from the long side. Looks like the summer of 2007 only much worse politics! #Commodities #Agriculture #Stocks
629 2018-10-11 20:47:54 Isn't the market's reaction also a function of the price levels? When stocks are priced for perfection (as many in the tech sector were), the reaction to a growth scare makes sense. 

Reaction to a recession would be even uglier - you are right in that.

639 2018-10-11 20:45:55 Hey @realDonaldTrump Your stock market is crashing, just as we knew it would. Ask GW Bush if trickle-down + deregulation helps the economy. We’ve had to learn this lesson over and over with Rs, but you will repeat the mistake once again. Thanks a lot loser. #stocks #markets #Dow

643 2018-10-11 20:45:23 I guess the CABAL is trying to destroy @POTUS economy by trying to tank the stocks even more. What did Maher say he wanted, a RECESSION! That's how people would get mad & vote him out. THESE PEOPLE ARE EVIL.
644 2018-10-11 20:45:18 Good lord. Natural disaster happening, stocks crashing, and Trump is busy hosting a total lunatic in the oval office as a press op. Conservatives, you are an absolute disgrace for allowing this to happen to your country. Eternal shame awaits you in the history books.
645 2018-10-11 20:45:11 auctions over... stocks are weak
646 2018-10-11 20:45:03 RT @jimcramer: @MelissaLeeCNBC Yep, huge rotation OUT of cyclicals into the slowdown stocks. Not a call to sell the market. Just a recognition that the economy is not as strong as the fed thinks.
647 2018-10-11 20:44:59 New report on has 6 predictions, 9 stocks and words like revolution, apocalypse and killer robots.
648 2018-10-11 20:44:34 Yes, Nike announced the deal on Sept 5, right at the bottom the prior dip. Of course, since then most stocks have been whacked by the Trump correction.
649 2018-10-11 20:44:29 $CNBC every guest on, says they sold three weeks ago and saw this coming. BS! we give @jimcramer credit for his call (because he did call it). But these guests, HA! you would think the sky is falling. Stick with #stocks,with good balance sheets & good cash flows for the long term

662 2018-10-11 20:42:08 There’s no hard rule or mathematical equation that makes taking back losses easier in stocks easier than new gains.

670 2018-10-11 20:39:59 I will focus on ETFs and stocks with Gaps to fill below only
671 2018-10-11 20:39:32 It’s all linked isn’t it? China, commodities, German exports, Dollar hegemony, Euro collapse, FAANG stocks, debt bubbles, pension problems the list list is endless. Man when this blows it will be all that and more once. What a sight. And it has begun.
672 2018-10-11 20:39:25 owners of stocks (as stock market, companies, and all involved) should return to the basic principle, that stocks are  held for the long term, as an asset, that companies will grow "automatically" in time, following a long term policy/vision designed by the board (and all).

682 2018-10-11 20:37:15 Everybody thinks oil will tank as it has in the past when markets sell off. I don't buy it personally & think we are just seeing imbalances coming into balance. Stocks overvalued while commodity stocks (including oil) undervalued. We lose equivalent of Iraq each year in declines.
683 2018-10-11 20:36:35 @cvpayne A lot of stocks in the green after the bell. How does that translate into tomorrow's session?
684 2018-10-11 20:36:32 Tech stocks overpriced, higher interest rates cutting into profits and borrowing mostly.
685 2018-10-11 20:36:26 hey, 401ks and stocks plummeting  might be thing to get some repugnicans to turn donald off
686 2018-10-11 20:36:26 Of course I have various investments. Anything I put into individual company stocks is purely okay money that I’m completely okay with losing. I’m not going to bet my retirement funds on just a few companies. 
687 2018-10-11 20:36:19 Hey AC(@stocks_insider), thank you for following me
688 2018-10-11 20:36:14 ..and that's why I'm invested 55/45% stocks/bonds.  Still a bit heavy in stocks for my age but I'm cool with the sell off.
689 2018-10-11 20:35:55 The top five stocks that closed lower today were $FLR, $CVS, $JEF, $HII, and $LNC.
690 2018-10-11 20:35:28 Told ya. You stayed calm, right? Deep breaths. As you can guess I don’t recommend buying the dip. Dollar cost averaging ftw every time. As always if you think you may need that money in the next 5-10 years it shouldn’t be in stocks.
691 2018-10-11 20:34:56 I had some stocks in the past (yep, 2008, and some personal misfortune).
Losing my life's savings made me realize the modern day stockmarkets, with hedge funds and day traders, isn't what it's original purpose was.
In fact, with the eagerness aimed at fast profits, company boards
692 2018-10-11 20:34:45 The top five stocks that closed higher today were $NEM, $LB, $FCX, $DAL, and $MCHP.

696 2018-10-11 20:34:07 As president, The Commander cannot suggest stocks or stock strategies.  I don't believe he ever has.  When a stock is overvalued x 2 you go short not long.  Because it is GOING to correct at some point.  Or you protect yourself by buying an option in the opposite direction.
697 2018-10-11 20:33:58 The top five most active stocks today were $AMD, $GE, $BAC, $F, and $T.

707 2018-10-11 20:31:16 Time to buy SuperMicro stocks.

709 2018-10-11 20:30:38 Has anyone thought what an 'election-eve' surprise the democrat donors and 'rich-cats' could present by 'selling their stocks', so THEIR 'media' darlings could insinuate 'more' NEGATIVITY about President Trump... Might 'buy'/'sell' orders be investigated AFTER the elections!

714 2018-10-11 20:30:08 yeah i can dig that. I don't think the president has much to do with the stocks, but I think the exception is the giant corporate tax cut from i think 33-35pct to 21pct ya dig

720 2018-10-11 20:29:04 Most equity buying and selling is done for speculation -- everybody trying to figure out what everybody else is willing to pay for stocks -- by superfast computer programs, guaranteeing volatility despite some backstops.
721 2018-10-11 20:28:48 captain obvious also touting value stocks.
722 2018-10-11 20:28:47 Interesting that its tech stocks. Bet they rebound after the election.
723 2018-10-11 20:28:36 Not that I’ve seen, but haven’t looked recently. Best chance is probably indices, not individual stocks.
724 2018-10-11 20:27:46 Not the stocks.
725 2018-10-11 20:27:38 So? The total amount of my stocks has increased, which means I'm winning. It's like you don't even understand capitalism
726 2018-10-11 20:27:20 Soundness of the policy of USD is already in jeopardy. This is why money managers argue one needs to own stocks because there is not store of value. News flash stocks are supposed to get a return in excess of the store of value, but if it has been destroyed the bar is set too low
727 2018-10-11 20:27:08 Cdn oil prices sub $20/bbl, housing sales collapsing, stocks correcting & this is what our central bank and gov't have done:

- Hiked minimum wages
- Hiked income taxes
- Disregarded US tax cuts
- Aggressive attacked small business (who employ 8.2mm Cdns)

730 2018-10-11 20:26:34 I am still long $AEL.   The timeline is vague due to this lawsuit between Caldera and Leon Black.   I think the selloff over the past few days is more relevant to ALL arbs/deal stocks selling off, not an AEL problem behind the scenes.
731 2018-10-11 20:26:30 The economy is strong ... inflation appears to be tame despite some fears of trade war ... I’d be a nibbler here of Chinese tech leader $BABA and American stocks like $AMZN $SHOP and $AVAV ... this pullback is extremely healthy unless the Fed goes crazy with too many hikes #MAGA
732 2018-10-11 20:26:28 I'm so glad I bought all your stocks when you panic-sold. I now have so many stocks
733 2018-10-11 20:26:18 If you are young keep buying the market and stocks. And think longer term. Keep adding into weakness. You want the market to go lower. Get more aggressively long the lower the market goes. You will get paid $qqq
734 2018-10-11 20:25:40 I get 2 paychecks a month. One goes to rent, one goes to bills, and I'm still behind on many. I don't go out with friends/take trips/buy luxuries/etc.. The tax bill has not helped me in the slightest. Stocks don't matter, the price of food and living increasing does.

739 2018-10-11 20:24:48 Diversification versus Diworsification always a huge debate.  But if you had 10 stocks #Cake would have wiped out 10% of your portfolio.  There were no signs, in my view, that it would blowup.  Funds help you diversify.  Probably 20 stocks is a minimum though for investors.
740 2018-10-11 20:24:47 As stocks fall for the 2nd day w/ huge losses, stock market investors must remember that midterm elections are upon us, it's the machines / algorithms which are truly making the market plummet. In turn controlled by many wanting to influence congressional elections.
741 2018-10-11 20:24:11 And, Fed raised rates. Tech stocks were down yday. EU announced something about their markets. Also, market is adjusting.
Bothered me when Fed raised rates. Thought it would bite into progress made.

743 2018-10-11 20:23:52 I am pro #2A. However, the use of bump stocks *effectively* turn a semi-automatic AR-15 into a fully automatic one. If a person can pull the trigger as fast as a bump stock or fully automatic rifle, no need for either. The effect of rapid fire rifles is focal point of the issue.
744 2018-10-11 20:23:21 I have no idea. The 2015 energy break to now reminds me somewhat of the 1998 EM break to 2000, in terms of sentiment/positioning. But predictions are always hard, esp the ones about the future. Luckily we came into this only 16% net long, just since cheap stocks are hard to find.

752 2018-10-11 20:22:25 Im happy. Most my stocks held up well. Ironically my biggest loser is the AAPL I bought just for a “safe play”. Haha. Everyone said dont buy the potstocks.

754 2018-10-11 20:21:49 Well, we own ranches and farms in 2 states, ships products from Montana to Texas with a fleet of semis, own a gravel pit and heavy construction outfit, and trade stocks and commodities full time.

I'm also a trained A&P mechanic.

I know how to work.

Now fuck off.
755 2018-10-11 20:21:32 I think it’s a bunch of things. Higher interest rates, a slow down in China and other economies, and a correction all mixed in. It’s been recommended to me to do 70% stocks 30% bonds and to rebalance every 6 months.

757 2018-10-11 20:21:14 STOCKS CRASHING: After dropping a historic 832 points yesterday, the Dow has been falling further today. At a rally last night, Pres. Trump boasted that the economy is stronger than ever.
758 2018-10-11 20:21:06 The Dow is down 5.23% since Friday.

You won't hear Trump or his acolytes bragging about the stock market, I guess.

But whatever. Now is not the time to exit stocks, ordinary investors.
759 2018-10-11 20:20:44 It may well not happen as business will gradually wind down amid the uncertainty. 6 months lead time on some Chinese imports means it’s begun. Stocks will be run down, production lines moth-balled and workers laid off while we await clarity.
760 2018-10-11 20:20:38 I agree Andrew, these falls normally throw up a small number of opportunities to acquire high quality stocks. At the moment it looks to me to be very similar to the pattern of the referendum in 2016. I've been watching #HL for a long time but never pulled the trigger.
761 2018-10-11 20:20:36 Translation, DJT doesn't know which stocks to short or option using his foreign accounts. As I've suggested for months, DJT has a figure in mind and when he hits that amt through trades or fundraising, etc, he'll lose interest in WH. History is on my side.
762 2018-10-11 20:19:56 Hey @realDonaldTrump  my stocks are tanking! Why are you not bragging about the stock market? My $25 tax cut isn't cutting it! Help!
763 2018-10-11 20:19:53 Stocks are slumping for a second straight day as the market endures its most volatile stretch since February. The Dow Jones industrials fell 545 points, or 2.1 percent, to 25,052.83  @WCBD
764 2018-10-11 20:19:22 Well, the market is obviously concerned about something happening about 6 months out. Another 545 points down again today. At 25k we use to think it was overvalued. I wonder if we now see it as inexpensive? Looks like more pain ahead with the way certain stocks closed...chin up!
765 2018-10-11 20:19:05 Tech stocks down? Buy more tech stocks.
766 2018-10-11 20:18:54 STOCKS CRASHING: After dropping a historic 832 points yesterday, the Dow has been falling further today. At a rally last night, Pres. Trump boasted that the economy is stronger than ever.
767 2018-10-11 20:18:42 Such pessimists, THIS IS HOW STOCKS WORK LMAO
768 2018-10-11 20:18:42 yes, at least you still learned!
769 2018-10-11 20:18:39 Dalio has his all-weather portfolio. I'm beta-testing a radical new 40/40/10 bad-weather portfolio. 40% gold, 40% cash, 10% stocks. So far so good...
770 2018-10-11 20:18:31 I reckon the Hawks are selling whilst his stocks are still relatively high. He looked lost when they tried him up forward at stages earlier in the year. A lot must think his standard is the game he played against the Crows last year. I’m a harsh critic of his type.
771 2018-10-11 20:18:05 Dow crippled, down 1000 pts in 2 days. Tax breaks caused stocks to rise for no reason. Tech trade war with China. Both Trump causes. All Trump gains from fake inflation are gone.
772 2018-10-11 20:18:03 Calls for a federal reserve replacement being quietly sought as stocks continue to plunge and manipulations of interest rate hikes is said to be the cause....
773 2018-10-11 20:18:01 #stocks#decline#again "Investors are contending with multiple concerns, including rising borrowing costs that could dampen economic growth and growing tensions between Beijing and Washington." @nytimes
774 2018-10-11 20:17:55 If the market went up everyday,poor people would own stocks & bonds..another -600 down 2mrw will cleanse the slate,then it resets

776 2018-10-11 20:17:20 like financial stocks?
777 2018-10-11 20:17:18 September 2003 was a pretty good time to buy stocks though :)
778 2018-10-11 20:17:08 stocks down again, what about our tremendous economy?

782 2018-10-11 20:15:56 I warned u about a move to 150/200-day mov avg on $SPX. But made BIG $ yesterday and up slightly today. If you were up yday & today, then u know what you're doing. DO NOT FOLLOW THE CNBCFastMoney TV traders - THEY ARE CLUELESS, pushing stocks up to Tues, NOW ALL SCARE, NO IDEAS!

784 2018-10-11 20:15:50 So you made the economy great?  Then why are stocks dropping.  All the credit for Herr Trumpy, but no responsibility?  Just asking for a friend.
785 2018-10-11 20:15:48 Speaking of affecting the markets, anyone know if Trump has been in touch with fellow insider trader Carl Icahn and if anyone in their circle might be benefiting off shorting stocks?

791 2018-10-11 20:14:45 My guess is that Jerome Powell will not respond to the markets.  At least I hope he really is a different kind of Fed Chair.  So, what will happen is that the tantrum won’t be rewarded, the markets will settle on their own, and then stocks will resume climbing on profit growth.
792 2018-10-11 20:14:40 Not entirely sure as the Fed has so many sophisticated tools in it’s bag to manipulate things... but I suspect increased jobless rates, foreclosure rate increase (but not as bad as 2008), dollar strengthening (hurting EMs), stocks market getting crushed, etc.
793 2018-10-11 20:14:35 people wanna act super surprised when the market crashes but ask them what a bank does or how stocks work and watch them clam up faster than something that clams up really fast
794 2018-10-11 20:14:20 Screw a 401k buy some tech stocks today.
795 2018-10-11 20:14:18 In 3 days US Market  #Vix has gone up 100+% ,This is all Due to Extraordinary bearish Position getting formed ,many people rushing for Exits .

797 2018-10-11 20:14:14 DOW ‘crashes’ again today but I had 3 stocks go positive so 
798 2018-10-11 20:14:03 World stocks sharply lower: US -2.1%; Europe -.2%. Fear overwhelmed greed as investors sought "safety" in bonds lowering their yields. Not a short-term trader but if market down again sharply I'll, have my checkbook out on Monday. Many high quality growth stocks will be on sale.
799 2018-10-11 20:13:49 Wall Street Instant Update: At the close #Stocks selloff continues with the Dow down another 545 points at 25,052, the Nasdaq off 1.2% at 7329, S&P -2.1% at 7097

801 2018-10-11 20:12:42 Stocks up relatively big after hours! Hmm
802 2018-10-11 20:12:38 Stocks pummelled again as selling intensifies 
The market will tank for a while and 12-18 months from now the Dow will be at 30,000 so don't be so happy libturds
803 2018-10-11 20:12:35 They go up and down. Anything less than a 10% move is not worthy of commentary.

I bet the last time you brought up stocks was at the February bottom. 

Check ur TL.
804 2018-10-11 20:12:13 Stocks TUMBLING DOWNWARDS again
805 2018-10-11 20:12:11 All 30 Dow stocks lower today. $MSFT fell the least. Interestingly, more defensive names got hit hardest. $PFE $XOM $CVX $MCD $PG $MRK $JNJ
806 2018-10-11 20:11:59 I'm glad I finally got the in order to sell off my stocks literally this morning. 

Was a month long process, done just in time
807 2018-10-11 20:11:42 “ A few rich folks that have stocks”? 

News flash for ya, everyone’s 401K plans are invested in stocks..
808 2018-10-11 20:11:37 Well, the stocks were artificially infatuated by buy-back after trump's gift to the 1% , so...
809 2018-10-11 20:11:28 @realDonaldTrump @federalreserve we get tax cuts, unemployment decreases, economy starts 2 get strong , consumer confidence rises , stocks rise & more people invest! Then you guys,4 some reason raise interest rates? Why!? What is the purpose?? I can understand.25% annually
810 2018-10-11 20:11:26 In February the Eurodollars moved like 25 ticks on these big down days in stocks.... On Italy we moved 15 or 20 ticks.  This thing has been like 6-8 ticks maybe, not enough vol, I'm going to have to move over to the vix
811 2018-10-11 20:11:13 I have a soft spot for weaklings who beg for taxpayer money when stocks drop
812 2018-10-11 20:10:47 #market #stocks finished lower again DOW & S&P declined more than 2% at closing bell today, after declining 3% at yesterday’s close, which comprises 6% lower for the week so far. Gold had it’s best gain in 2 yrs up 2.77% for the day!! 
813 2018-10-11 20:10:38 I don't own or understand stocks.

We are a lower middle class family on a strict, paycheck-to-paycheck budget.

I budget $35 for gas each payday. 
Today, I paid $45.

Last week's grocery bill was $30 higher than we're used to paying. 

How about you ask me how the economy is?
814 2018-10-11 20:10:27 Long term investments. Most stocks and crypto aren't short term - you don't want to look at that shit for another 2-3 years minimum.

816 2018-10-11 20:10:06 Yoyr mocking of the White House at the end if your shit show referencing the stocks.  Stock numbers  are still higher than your boy Barack Hussein was in.
817 2018-10-11 20:10:01 I'm seeing something for the Chinese tech stocks that's going down hard. Asian markets are hit hard as HANG SENG INDEX has a -926.70 loss. Europe's kinda the same but only lost -100ish
818 2018-10-11 20:09:58 What do you say. How long will be the "correction" in #NASDAQ?
I think it was obvious. Think also about 20% (from last peek). 1000 points, but the #stocks are good, Bac definitely broke it's upside before 2008.
819 2018-10-11 20:09:54 So I would say I am down 8% WTD, though some of my stocks have been pretty resilient #PKG for one.
#clutchingatstraws
820 2018-10-11 20:09:44 Just a thought... maybe the tech stocks are going down because the ppl that can buy these stocks are getting upset because they are shadow banning & generally anti conservative.
821 2018-10-11 20:09:39 still a lot of cheerleaders coming on the boob tube making a case for how great the discount is now for stocks. their reasoning makes no sense to me.
822 2018-10-11 20:09:22 Ok. 530 stocks.
823 2018-10-11 20:09:22 Stocks down, wish the feds would leave the rates low a bit longer! Rep or Dem, low rates help the stock market  and real estate .

825 2018-10-11 20:09:07 Bad week if you refi'd your mortgage into a floating rate to invest in stocks
826 2018-10-11 20:09:03 Stocks pummelled again 
Yes, what goes up must come down, but the economy is largely an "idea". The liberal media has done everything it can to destroy consumer confidence & make a daily stream of doomsday predictions. It'll come back so long as we don't drink the Kool-Aid.
827 2018-10-11 20:08:40 Something to think about: 
It's an old aphorism, variously attributed to J.P. Morgan and other legendary investors of yore, that states: “In bear markets, stocks return to their rightful owners.”
828 2018-10-11 20:08:03 "invest in stocks" they said.

And I listened.

But I was two years and one president too late 

Byebye 35 percent of my money.
829 2018-10-11 20:08:00 Interesting day for the markets, but remember, in the long run, these things always go up! Unless your stocks are going out of business, HOLD and even BUY if you feel this is the bottom. #DOW
830 2018-10-11 20:07:52 Stocks are up, life is good
831 2018-10-11 20:07:37 So I don't know anything about investing in stocks. Is now a good time to invest in anything?
832 2018-10-11 20:07:33 Yep, between the tariffs and the massive tax cut, the wealthy can buy back stocks at unheard of bargains. Meanwhile, workers lose.
833 2018-10-11 20:07:30 Most of what I did today was cover shorts. I covered all my $SPY hedges today. Call me crazy but when you trade 256 mm shares vs. 65 mm avg and VIX up violently and stocks collapsing, seems ready for bounce. Added to $MDR, $VZ & $EMR shorts though.
834 2018-10-11 20:07:09 Today's cash flow out of stocks was just as bad as yesterday's.

Not sure if that's bearish or bullish, but there it is.
835 2018-10-11 20:06:58 I think Seattle could be in for a wild ride. Higher rates + high current prices + potentially shrinking prices of tech stocks.
836 2018-10-11 20:06:49 Dow down massively again for 2nd day in a row. good stocks will rise again not worried..
837 2018-10-11 20:06:47 While $KGKG was going nuts and drawing all the attention, $CANB which is another of my favorite #CBD stocks, quietly put in a very solid 23% day coming off that new base it established. #MJOTCs #MJ #Hemp

(I own some $HIPH too, but it’s already gone 7x & had a failed run today.)
838 2018-10-11 20:06:06 My stocks are tumbling but luckily I haven’t invested much yet.

840 2018-10-11 20:05:56 Remember actual trading halts, too? Been a long, long time since one of those was triggered (for a market/index vs. individual stocks of course)
841 2018-10-11 20:05:12 @realDonaldTrump screaming “Look at what the democrats did to the stock market! Democrats want America to be bankrupt!” #realDonaldTrump #401k #AngryDemocratMob #MAGA #LiarInChief #stocks #DowJones
842 2018-10-11 20:05:01 30 stocks. That's all.
843 2018-10-11 20:04:59 For those not familiar with the stock market there has never, ever, been a correction and when stocks go down it is not a good time to buy "bargains" because over the long term they will never go up again. Also read and believe all media panic headlines as they are right
844 2018-10-11 20:04:58 Maybe it's time for gold? Obviously the dollar should move lower. Obviously yields HAVE to move lower. Obviously stocks hope to move higher. Gold is going to run and get out of the way if they want it that way
845 2018-10-11 20:04:41 So @MaylanStudart in today’s money news the Stocks went down more then 500 points and 2 day lose of over 1300 points. Maylan what is your thoughts on the future of the stocks?
846 2018-10-11 20:04:34 Yeah we're now talking -1200 and going down. Stocks are closed once again.
847 2018-10-11 20:04:31 Stocks continue to plunge. The Dow closed at 25,052.83, down 545.91 (-2.13%). Nasdaq -1.25%. S&P -2.06%.

850 2018-10-11 20:04:17 @JebBush @RealRonHoward  The investments into stocks have to stay in for a long time. Imagine if you had gotten $1 million in your account from someone then three days later they take it out, then put in $200,000, then two weeks later take it out, then put in $3 million then 4 da
851 2018-10-11 20:04:15 IMO if stocks keep dropping slowly, GOLD and $BTC will break upwards soon. Swift drop of 30+% will probably hit BTC and GOLD too-in 2000 after tech bubble popped out, after initial rally, GOLD made swing low first and big multiyear rally didn't start until NASDAQ found its floor
852 2018-10-11 20:04:13 $CAT got good earning last quarter. I don't think they can't make this time. But $BAC failed revenue last quarter. My thought they'll be Beat revenue this time if not stocks back to be $20 per share

861 2018-10-11 20:02:40 Worth noting stocks have traded down every day since the Baltimore Orioles baseball season concluded. 

I'm not saying there is any correlation. I am saying you'll hear equally ridiculous stabs at correlation right now if you turn on CNBC.
862 2018-10-11 20:02:28 I am not impressed with a lousy 2 point rally in the bonds for  this big a selloff in stocks, FWIW.
863 2018-10-11 20:02:16 One stock market secret that historically holds true: Tech stocks are usually over valued and over traded. Not sure #Tron is the reason. #ChangeMyMind  Or maybe there’s an #InvisibleHand at play #AdamSmith ? #ThirstyThursday

875 2018-10-11 19:59:07 Just asking for a friend. Trump took all the credit for the rise in stocks, does he take the blame for The loses?
876 2018-10-11 19:59:01 Bond yields went up too fast, so panic sell your stocks and rotate into bonds, so yields go down and stocks can go back up.
877 2018-10-11 19:58:09 If you're contributing to your 401K (like most ppl) at some point you want lower prices. This seems like a good opportunity. I get that some of these tech stocks got torched yesterday, but they're still up big on a yr.
878 2018-10-11 19:58:04 108? Easily. If stocks keep falling it can go even lower
879 2018-10-11 19:57:31 the DJIA is literally a list of like 50 stocks that nobody gives a shit about except for newspapers who like big numbers. Everyone worth a shit follows the S&P 500. That's down like nothing in comparison.
880 2018-10-11 19:57:29 Very similar here, my stocks are all low leverage value stocks and some select junior miners

882 2018-10-11 19:57:26 @DailyZeitgeist @jack_obrien
why the stock market dropped: Essentially, the stock market has been accelerating in growth, and the federal bank got worried about inflation and raised interest rates. That makes gov bonds more attractive, so people sold their stocks to buy bonds.

885 2018-10-11 19:56:23 This certainly does not feel like a bottom in #stocks but as I said, adding a bit to longs when the S&P was 2720 made sense. My gut says we will have lower levels than that before this is over so if you missed this quick selloff, I believe you will get another chance
886 2018-10-11 19:56:20 rewatching leffen vs plup @ bighouse... leffen basically threw away 5 stocks in their matches. i think he was actually playing better for sure, personally. feels real bad man

890 2018-10-11 19:55:13 Oh man you had to have about 2 years patience to tweet that. Bonds are up. Stocks go down. Give it a rest dude
891 2018-10-11 19:54:57 Umm, the market is down because the economy is so good, resulting in fears of inflation, prompting the Fed to raise rates, which hurts stocks.
892 2018-10-11 19:54:45 $study one thing that is bothering me about this sell off was it was too obvious.  Everyone on #Fintwits (at least on my feed) was already in cash and out of the growth stocks at least a week ago.  OR we all just that good?
893 2018-10-11 19:54:29 The @GiveBloodNHS app is complaining that stocks are low and to book an appointment as early as possible! Lol! If they had appointments...
894 2018-10-11 19:54:10 $SGYP I guess they decided to short stocks that are actually overbought today —like Ironwood
895 2018-10-11 19:53:57 I have and I am taking this drop to buy some specific stocks. Not exactly rolling in dough ATM but being judicious about it

897 2018-10-11 19:53:53 Oh and you can go ahead and stuff your "this is only computers trading with each other" takes in the garbage.  I've spent two days hand trading stocks for huge institutions.
898 2018-10-11 19:53:51 But instead bonds closed and stocks puked.
899 2018-10-11 19:53:37 Yesterday’s market declines: Dow down 3.15%, S&P 500 down 3.29% & tech stocks, represented by the Nasdaq, off 4.08% were entirely within normal range of mini adjustment. We’ve seen numerous times since 3/9/2009.  But they represent an interesting test of character market pundits.
900 2018-10-11 19:53:34 Chinis interest stocks jump on 
Dow plunges 500 points
Dow down 699 point low
Dow fall 1000+ point last 2days
901 2018-10-11 19:53:24 I still have a Dm where someone asked why I'd put funds in currencies/commodities when there's tech stocks ...I still read it for a deep chuckle now and then
902 2018-10-11 19:53:23 Poor people don’t make money on stocks.
903 2018-10-11 19:53:16 Go check your stocks they are not doing very well
904 2018-10-11 19:53:00 Which are your fav top 10 stocks for long term?
905 2018-10-11 19:52:49 Do  you  also  track  midcap stocks?

907 2018-10-11 19:52:23 While Orangeman was getting his oxygen of “love” from the crowd:
1) Thousands of Americans lost their homes
2) Mexico Beach was like a war zone with Americans there
3) Stocks plunged 800+ points
4) Washington Post journalist killed by Jared’s BFF
What’s wrong with this picture?
908 2018-10-11 19:52:08 At the moment being shrewd in Zim means going against the system and you don't want that, that's the reason why you see some companies shutting now and giving renovations as excuses, business are halting operations to protect their stocks since they can't raise prices to keep up
909 2018-10-11 19:51:59 Trump is an idiot. No president had involved in illegal trading until Trump. It's why he is so focus on popping stocks up.
910 2018-10-11 19:51:38 Guys, consider that all markets are down. My stocks are down and so is my $XRP investment. I believe its a market cycle, but one from which we could rise stronger than ever before. Hold your assets, let‘s battle the bear.
911 2018-10-11 19:51:27 The Stock Trader Advisory DIFFERENCE:  this large market decline means NET GAINS for our investors, since a majority of our stocks already signaled SELL SHORT over the past 6 weeks.  #RESPONSIVETRADING = PROFITS, no matter what the market does.

913 2018-10-11 19:51:07 Another day without any trade. I see many different opinions about if the Overall Market influences in Penny Stocks. Only thing that I’m sure is you can find less opportunities in the long side, so for me the Market is important. @timothysykes
914 2018-10-11 19:51:01 The Trump crash cause: give tax cuts to individuals and companies that don’t need them. Massively increase deficit. Force govt to increase borrowing exponentially. Interest rates MUST go up. Invoke tariffs. Stocks sell off.
915 2018-10-11 19:50:53 Pay attention November will be worse. STOCKS CRASHING: After dropping a historic 832 points yesterday, the Dow has been falling further today.
916 2018-10-11 19:50:52 Yay stocks crashing. Hopefully the US dollar plummets, we can stop talking about fuel taxes #nzpol, and I can affordably visit my ʻōhana in Anahola.
917 2018-10-11 19:50:41 $3230 today! Yesterday’s wrog plays were a lesson to trade accordingly with the new market trend! Only two stocks traded $UVXY $TLRY 6 trades. How did I do it? Patiently waiting for my setup to form. Could’ve made more but I was actually studying $UVXY action.
918 2018-10-11 19:50:27 Murder, mayhem, Michael, stocks plummeting, and he’s just bs-ing in the Oval Office. That desk is so clear airplanes could come in for a landing.
919 2018-10-11 19:50:03 Darn! I’ve been putting off selling stock till January so I can put off dealing with tax forms. Come on, trumpers, buy stocks! Just till January 5th even. Please! Please! You’ve been ignoring GOP trade policies this long, can’t you delude yourselves for a few more months!
920 2018-10-11 19:48:43 forgot I put all my money in weed stocks
921 2018-10-11 19:48:32 Stocks?
922 2018-10-11 19:48:23 Tu penses que les stocks vont être augmentés plus tard ?
923 2018-10-11 19:48:19 lots of stocks are discounted right now which makes for excellent buying opportunity. cant wait to snatch me up some square cash stocks on payday
924 2018-10-11 19:48:02 Notice that so called "growth" stocks are getting hammered this month but "value" stocks are holding their own.  Maybe you should have both of them in your portfolio for the long term.  #markets #growthvsvalue #StockMarketCrash
925 2018-10-11 19:48:00 I just started investing in stocks too lol
926 2018-10-11 19:47:46 Last min loads on stock  $DATI before the take off begins #stocks #pennystocks #trading #ThursdayThoughts
927 2018-10-11 19:47:43 Yea that’s what I’m thinking. A lot of the stocks in portfolio are back to same price I bought them for initially. They are good too.
928 2018-10-11 19:47:38 ... @CNBC reporting #Chinese #Internet stocks now moving higher! Bottom is in!
929 2018-10-11 19:47:37 USDA: US corn ending stocks forecast increased 39 million bushels to 1,1813 million. Yield forecast was trimmed with production at 14,778 million bushels, which was small that trade expectations
930 2018-10-11 19:47:03 Even if you're buying individual stocks instead of index funds, the difference between an investor and a speculator still holds.
931 2018-10-11 19:46:53 Lets Not forget teacher that the dollar was PUSHED down to 0.14 (UUP) today as well & stocks are STILL  selling off !!!!  : ]
932 2018-10-11 19:46:28 President Trump slammed Federal Reserve’s rising interest rates after stocks plunged Wednesday, saying, “the Fed has gone crazy.”

Fed. Chairman Powell "knows" raising rates right now is incredibly dangerous&not in the best interest of our country

This is NOT a coincidence
933 2018-10-11 19:45:55 You misunderstand.  He’s taking credit for commodity prices, strong world GDP - so why not stocks?  Of course it’s absurd but you are missing the irony
934 2018-10-11 19:45:55 I wish I was educated on stocks, because now would be the time to buy.
935 2018-10-11 19:45:36 Many are programmed to sell based on stock price action, hence my line that "stocks are down because stocks are down."
936 2018-10-11 19:45:32 They caved on bump stocks but people think they peddle machine guns?
937 2018-10-11 19:45:29 The stock market had a slight dip. If you are freaking out,you should probably not be investing. It's for the long haul. Over time,the market continues to grow. During a down time,stocks are on sale. Don't try to time the market.Just invest consistently & focus on time in market.
938 2018-10-11 19:45:14 So trump decided to be his own ppt and leak the meeting just as stocks were tanking. Smart
939 2018-10-11 19:45:06 Our hookah bar stocks premium shisha tobacco and all your favorite flavors. Stop by today.
940 2018-10-11 19:44:58 With US stocks down, bonds finding a footing, Xi headline, Turkey détente etc..., it seems that many of the narratives which have been fueling the strong dollar story are suddenly starting to unravel.
941 2018-10-11 19:44:48 I think it'd be smart to pull out if they could because WWE has already lost $1 billion in stocks
942 2018-10-11 19:44:31 Pull out of women, not stocks.
943 2018-10-11 19:43:19 Percent of Stocks Above 200-Day Moving Average: 35.10
944 2018-10-11 19:42:49 And look at EM stocks!
945 2018-10-11 19:42:47 Stocks crashing again...the problem isn’t that the 1% lose here but that small business owners, the middle class lose.  They lose a much higher and a more devastating percent of their investments... That does trickle down..
946 2018-10-11 19:42:29 Corporations are using their TRUMP given tax cut money, not to reward the workers, but to buy back shares of their stocks to pad executive bonuses and reward wealthy investors. So far it’s up to $350 Billion in buybacks this year.
947 2018-10-11 19:42:18 STOCKS CRASHING: After dropping a historic 832 points yesterday, the Dow has been falling further today. At a rally last night,  Trump boasted that the economy is stronger than ever.
948 2018-10-11 19:42:07 I just looked. Should I move my 30% in stocks to safety?
949 2018-10-11 19:42:01 Yea, PPT....so Greg, can you tell what specific stocks they buy to prop ??
950 2018-10-11 19:42:01 everyone still a bull, noone seems to be considering a possible bear market starting here.  Yet so many stocks are already down over 20%.
Still everyone seems to be buying the dip for the next leg higher.  Who knows.
951 2018-10-11 19:41:55 dropped less than many top stocks. still not bad for the ‘highly speculative and risky’, no?

958 2018-10-11 19:40:44 Later I’m gonna screenshot a bunch of solid ideas I had about stocks and shitcoins over the past 7-10 days.

961 2018-10-11 19:40:20 It also shows he doesnt know what the economy is. Stocks were up because of millionaire tax breaks but the economy, which is a completely different thing has been in decline for a while.
The rich doing well doesnt mean the economy is.
962 2018-10-11 19:40:18 I have to wonder who in the administration sold stocks Monday and Tuesday.

978 2018-10-11 19:37:16 It's so funny, when stock are high, Trump says, "see what I'm doing for the stock market," when stocks are low, he blames the Feds! I think Trump is a "nut job," no matter how you slice it!  
979 2018-10-11 19:36:58 Each time US stocks recovered though. Will that happen again here?
980 2018-10-11 19:36:55 Currently my portfolio is bleeding but I am not going sell anything...I am waiting for results to add more stocks in my portfolio.
981 2018-10-11 19:36:53 Rather than figuring out what stocks those are supposed to be, I'm just going to pretend it was a compliment.
982 2018-10-11 19:36:46 This latest intra-day spike is just short-covering, IMHO. I can see it from watching which individual stocks on my screen spike, etc. Not a good sign for the bulls. What the bulls would like to see (for a bottom) is a big flush where we close right at the lows.
983 2018-10-11 19:36:40 Resistance falling of stocks is the best way to exhaust the buy power. The way the index fall is a typical resistance fall. So we will have a long way to fall.
984 2018-10-11 19:36:40 @Ripple stocks definitely the cutest. #DOGE might be some stiff competition though
985 2018-10-11 19:36:21 Of course! Also sauceytrades on IG points out some good stocks. They’re not all money makers at 1st but they’re  good definitely good to look at if you’re really trynna study the market!

989 2018-10-11 19:35:54 What’s up is...no matter what direction the stock market goes, the 1% will benefit in some way—just like they did in ‘08. If it crashes again they’ll buy stocks and real estate for pennies on the dollar with their tax cut windfall and then laugh all the way to the bank .
990 2018-10-11 19:35:31 I told you it’s all bullshit they bring all the bank stocks down don’t matter if it’s good or bad news tomorrow they are going to pump them all back up between now and the end of the year I would be using the shit out of bank stocks MFST, APPL,GOOG, and AMZN this happens every

992 2018-10-11 19:35:17 Chinese stocks like $BIDU and $BABA lost a lot... Maybe a chance for a st recovery!? buying small positions.
993 2018-10-11 19:35:03 Yes, je l'ai merci ! Mais j'ai du mal à comprendre pourquoi les stocks s'écoulent aussi peu vite...  On dirait @LimitedRunGames en mieux (avec moins de stock, mais en moins cher et on peut commander sans se presser )
994 2018-10-11 19:34:42 Buy stocks!? 
Most of us can't even buy socks!

ain't that right right fox news?

995 2018-10-11 19:34:40 @PatriotsSoapbox stocks down in tech & energy! Is Soros cashing in to try to cause a crash?
996 2018-10-11 19:34:34 might not be the easiest thing to do, but the same stocks that made you get the feeling of regret on the way up should be taken advantage of on the way down!

997 2018-10-11 19:34:29 @RobinhoodApp quick question, does day trading crypto follow the same rules as day trading stocks?
998 2018-10-11 19:34:26 Don’t forget many of these funds you refer to have lent out their stocks to shorts and earning interest. Maybe they think the shorties are the ones who are losing their money. Just sayin.
999 2018-10-11 19:34:15 I’m tryna learn stocks more
1000 2018-10-11 19:33:50 Unless stocks crater in 27 min, I would think the odds strongly favor a rally for a few days. Look at the tails on the daily indices
1001 2018-10-11 19:33:48 10.11: More rebalancing today. Keeping stocks I strongly believe in and maintaning defensive stocks, adding positions to those that did well in February, reducing positions with significant gains... #StockMarket
1002 2018-10-11 19:33:47 Chinese stocks look good here. Growth is ok and today's CNY strength and G20 headline tells me the national team should follow shortly. $JD in particular feels overdone and worth a punt on its own
1003 2018-10-11 19:33:11 Is this the right time to buy more stocks when the market is down like that $nbev #stocks #market #Stockexchange #StockMarket
1004 2018-10-11 19:33:09 The way stocks are dramatically bouncing all over the place is a pretty good clue that algos are playing a major role here. Let's stop with all the high interest rate fears and China trade issues. Those items are not driving this market.

1008 2018-10-11 19:32:13 Morgan Street Capital says stocks could fall 40-50% to reach fair value - just food for thought for anyone trying to catch falling knives.
1009 2018-10-11 19:32:02 You're saying that Cramer shorts stocks?   Is there proof of that?
1010 2018-10-11 19:31:29 Trump is waging an all-out trade war and creating a staggering budget deficit (say 5% of GPD), but when stocks go down 5% it is the Fed's fault?
1011 2018-10-11 19:31:11 Absolutely. I thought this yesterday myself when I saw stocks plummeting.

1021 2018-10-11 19:28:42 a very good reason not to buy stocks.
1022 2018-10-11 19:28:39 China stocks (the most beaten up) will see the greatest gains on this news. $JD $BABA $FXI all big buys here. This will form a support bottom on these stocks until the meeting. Shorts may cover as well on spec deal will get done.
1023 2018-10-11 19:28:36 Its global politics.  The money will return when the election is over. Probably sooner. Because the stocks were priced according to their company values It wasn't fake
1024 2018-10-11 19:28:34 Stocks are tumbling down. 
1025 2018-10-11 19:28:30 Initiating long position in beaten down stocks like $AMAT with waterfall daily charts. Way oversold.  Buy into this bs -1400 DOW drop

1029 2018-10-11 19:27:34 Somehow I have like over $2000 in Starbucks stocks that I could cash out and I still don’t get how I works lmao
1030 2018-10-11 19:27:34 Tech stocks. FB. Etc. They keep tanking I will use some Trump cash a buy back in..Lol.
1031 2018-10-11 19:27:01 You're very right there. And the global correlation with the US market in bad times also hampers mitigation strategies for non-US stocks. It is however possible to invest in companies with margin of safety. Only variable we control is if and where we invest.
1032 2018-10-11 19:26:47 I bailed out of stocks at the beginning of last month... so far I'm not down 15%... now if I'd only followed that same gut feeling in September 2008 my retirement accounts would be sitting pretty right now.
1033 2018-10-11 19:26:36 Gonna buy some stocks just to sell them immediately
1034 2018-10-11 19:26:31 Most of my stocks are actually up.  TWTR, MU, JD, BABA, DAL, STWD, BX...Not too bad...My bank stocks sucked today tho
1035 2018-10-11 19:26:29 Any more re stocks? It sold out so fast :(
1036 2018-10-11 19:25:59 Some tech stocks are turning positive.
1037 2018-10-11 19:25:59 What's down with stocks, you mean?
1038 2018-10-11 19:25:45 Um, they don’t have money to buy stocks. tRump has taken care of that. Companies closing down, tariffs, gas hikes, etc.
1039 2018-10-11 19:25:43 I had to take a second look but #GOPRO #GPRO is up 6.48%!!

1042 2018-10-11 19:25:14 Stocks are tumbling, interest rates are rising, we possibly were aware of #Kashoggi being lured to his death and Trump is in the Oval listening to #Kanye fiddle as the US burns.  #VoteThemOut2018
1043 2018-10-11 19:25:14 Its Trump vs the Federal Reserve... WTF , I don’t care just stop the bleeding. A government should be a cohesive unit not separate entities. #losingmoney #stocks 
1044 2018-10-11 19:25:11 Good thing I sold cause these stocks are taking a hit this week 
1045 2018-10-11 19:24:57 Most of my stocks are up right now, JD, DAL, BX, STWD, BABA...Not really that bad of a day...Banks sucking again but good opportunity to add GS, MS, C and BAC
1046 2018-10-11 19:24:37 Anyone find it suspicious that algos crashed stocks only to then ramp them massively minutes later? Algos are just stealing retail $
1047 2018-10-11 19:24:31 Would you say that stocks that hold up well will be bigger movers than previous movers/leaders that are forming the left side of a base? AMD vs ENDP for example.. One corrected after a big move and the other holding in a tight-ish range? Which kinds of stocks should be targeted?
1048 2018-10-11 19:24:25 Let's see if Kanye's visit with Trump boosts Adidas' sales/stocks like Kap's commercial did Nike's.

1055 2018-10-11 19:23:08 So, George SOROS may be trying to help the Clintonites by shorting tech and bank stocks, creating havoc and turmoil, but good for Gold, "Depression" before the midterm election may be their goal ! If mass panic and havic does occur, President Trump may have to invoke MARTIAL LAW

1057 2018-10-11 19:22:05 Kek, stocks. Green by close ? :-) At least we now know Trump will probably do a deal if market pressures him enough.
1058 2018-10-11 19:21:58 1) Republicans stimulate a good economy via a tax cut for the 1% to please the Koch brothers.
2) That creates inflationary pressures that the Fed has to counteract with interest rate hikes
3) Stocks become relatively less attractive compared to bonds to the stock market dives.

1065 2018-10-11 19:20:58 A sound yet simple approach for long term traders looking to buy a dip in stocks is buying once a daily candle closes back above the 200 day moving average. Such trader could consider using either a stop loss or closing (at a loss) whenever price closes back below the 200 DMA.
1066 2018-10-11 19:20:50 Yes u can trade stock in London. But u can trade stocks in New York City as well.

1069 2018-10-11 19:20:43 What the hell is going on with the stocks???
1070 2018-10-11 19:20:40 We are seeing some signs of capitulation based on the high volatility as well as the % of stocks at new lows, advancers vs. decliners, and the RSI 14 indicator. But like the Feb/March selloff, these bouts of volatility can take some time to resolve.
1071 2018-10-11 19:20:37 We had this conversation on Tuesday Dave. 

Same as the rivers Severn and Teme having lots of otters but fish stocks are falling.
1072 2018-10-11 19:20:31 I just said that to my DH! They are tanking the market on purpose. No surprise it’s a lot of tech stocks.
1073 2018-10-11 19:19:59 Make me surprised$RACE stocks plunged 13% in 8 sessions without any particular financial news (except Q3 at 5/11)! Unpredictable, maybe
1074 2018-10-11 19:19:57 Burn it down... I wanna buy some stocks on the cheap.
1075 2018-10-11 19:19:17 Agreed, the Fed is in bed with the Deep state Trump resistance and is trying to sink stocks to hurt GOP in the election which would hurt @realDonaldTrump in his ability to get things passed through Congress. Don't buy into this people! Once election is over Stocks will rally!
1076 2018-10-11 19:19:06 But you can trade stocks on the London stock exchange. The money is not in commercial banking it is Investment Banking.

1086 2018-10-11 19:17:33 Don’t buy stocks, it is not a good time.
1087 2018-10-11 19:17:28 Bump stocks were approved by the Obama admin!  I might suggest reading the National Firearms Act of 1934, would be a good starting point, But like Libs accuse Kanye, they can't read.....

1094 2018-10-11 19:16:31 He’s busy keeping campaign promises. Maybe after he gets funding for the wall he can work on bump stocks.
1095 2018-10-11 19:16:31 can you ugh please slow down the boys' schedule a lil bit? @bts_bighit @BigHitEnt it wont harm your stocks but let them rest couple of days/weeks between every countries' tour please. and tell the concert promoters to book stadium instead of doing several nights shows
1096 2018-10-11 19:16:11 The question is: if my personal holdings are already trading at fair value, or undervalued, will they end up at the top of the pile post-avalanche? Judging the market as a whole is meaningless when a handful of overvalued stocks are responsible for most of the index gains
1097 2018-10-11 19:16:02 I think you mean what's down with stocks

1103 2018-10-11 19:14:42 Ok, lets be clear. I used to be a trader in my country. I quite how to manipulate the price. Crypto was no different than stocks in my poor country (Im from VN if you're curious). So PnD here in Binance is quite normal to me. Is this PnD good? No it's not.
1104 2018-10-11 19:14:37 Cannabis stocks will be the leader of next rally.
1105 2018-10-11 19:14:36 The economy is too strong and PEs are too low for that to happen right now. And the money from the bond market will go into stocks.

6. Automatic weapons are for war... And not necessary for citizens
1111 2018-10-11 19:14:06 .@mpurves3: We continue to maintain, however, that what has been working will continue to work. Put another way, if large cap tech/growth fails, the ability of value stocks to lead the market higher is tenuous -- the growth rally “is the rally”.
1112 2018-10-11 19:14:05 this is what kills the 200 stocks a year being given out on mad money.
1113 2018-10-11 19:13:55 Now your paying attention cuz stocks plunge for 2 consecutive days.

1122 2018-10-11 19:13:11 what the hell stocks quadrupled in value in 9 months

1125 2018-10-11 19:12:31 stocks are falling in USA.. collapsing stocks in China (down 20%) Europe (down 10%) caused a decline in demand for products of USA companies  and sales of some US companies sales declined .  Farm products (soybeans) already hit as was as cars (Ford)...so a decline here is coming
1126 2018-10-11 19:12:22 Nikkei is the Japanese stock market index which peaked in 1991 and has yet to recover.

In US stocks returned 0 from 2000 to 2013. Long term return is nearly entirely driven based on starting valuation and US markets are second only to 2000 in valuation.

Be careful out there.

1130 2018-10-11 19:12:00 and back to buying same stocks the next week. sec and deep state is short sellers dream. money for nothing.
1131 2018-10-11 19:11:56 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
1132 2018-10-11 19:11:43 Tomorrow.... 35 /45....   short vix... buy stocks...
1133 2018-10-11 19:11:39 So, the theory:

 Stockmarkets crash through tech bubble and fundamental. 
 Commodities breakout (Gold). 
 $BTC and crypto following the commodities?
 Yield and inflation moving upwards?
 Bad earnings season?

So far so good. Stocks ain’t over dropping by far.
1134 2018-10-11 19:11:17 I see that job swap to the stocks team you were looking for has come through?
1135 2018-10-11 19:11:08 I don’t think the bankers like trump. And since he been elected the been raising rates. Our economy is getting stronger but still weak. Most of these tech companies have large dept little profits. If stock drop they will have a hard time staying at float.

1137 2018-10-11 19:10:53 Until Markets stabilize,

1138 2018-10-11 19:10:40 Due to trade war good economy and sugar high, stocks plunge. 45 is blaming the Federal Reserve saying it is out of control. 
1139 2018-10-11 19:10:38 Tired: stocks are down on poor tech performance, trade war fears, and rising interest rates

Wired: stocks are down because of the trade war alone; it's all Trump's fault

Inspired: this is all because of Brett Kavanaugh
1140 2018-10-11 19:10:32 #thursdaythoughts: OKAY!!! Now that the Stocks have dropped ~1800 pts in 2 days, Democrats and Socialist #Obama, should declare right now, WHO'S ECONOMY is it?

IMHO: It's STILL Trump's economy and the Stocks will climb again.

1141 2018-10-11 19:10:29 I love the cannabis industry. Love it. It’s where I’m focusing the majority of my time and energy these last 3 years. But “pot stocks” publicly trading in Toronto? No no no. NO.
1142 2018-10-11 19:10:11 Many stocks approaching support levels. Crucial. $SQ $MU $AMD $NFLX be on look out for bounce. If fall through, bad.
1143 2018-10-11 19:10:05 Wtf?? You should take an economics class bud.. this has to do with the FED and the fact the market was propped up on no volume and stock buybacks. take shares out of the float demand is higher, now these guys are dumping these institutionally held stocks. Win/win for top c.e.o's
1144 2018-10-11 19:09:59 I wonder why its stocks are going up?
1145 2018-10-11 19:09:54 Stocks, Stocks, Stocks.
1146 2018-10-11 19:09:37 As interest rates go up more people will invest more in bonds and less in stocks. Now that we have value stocks holding stronger than growth stocks indicating we are near the highest the market can go.
1147 2018-10-11 19:09:35 My stocks may never go up again
1148 2018-10-11 19:09:30 One of my favorite tape-watching dynamics is watching how stocks trade relative to vicious moves in the market (either way).  Thus far, fwiw and subject to change, there are buyers below in #cannabis.  Sorta need the tape to hang in, tho.
1149 2018-10-11 19:09:29 big runs up in gold stocks = bearish for stocks  ABX NEM AU KL SA HMY GG etc
1150 2018-10-11 19:09:28 First they fell because yields got too high too fast, but now people are selling stocks and buying bonds, so yields are down, but that's still bad.
It's tough to pinpoint one reason, but it seems like the jump in yields brought out some other fears about trade, prices, etc.
1151 2018-10-11 19:09:25 What the fuck is wrong with #stocks today!? Why the fuck #amazon keeps dropping down?
1152 2018-10-11 19:09:15 Looking into some Pot stocks to invest in, feel like once it’s federally legal & DEA approves of it, stocks will soar 
1153 2018-10-11 19:09:12 Rally in U.S. Treasurys picks up steam as stocks slump
1154 2018-10-11 19:09:11 1) Don't believe Jumlas.
2) Not the right time to sell your stocks.
1155 2018-10-11 19:09:10 Stocks are on discount ayeeee

1168 2018-10-11 19:06:41 $stocks the only way for a stock to go up is investor interest. 
It can go down by
1. Warrants redeemed
2. Shorts selling to shorts
3. Bad report
4. Dilution
5. Shorts selling to investors

If I'm wrong explain please.
The game is rigged, play the game or fail.

Stocks are a component of the leading indicators series. 

They've predicted 11 of the last 3 recessions. 

This doesn't mean they're wrong, but it does mean they are volatile. 
Drops like this do not mean the world is ending.
1240 2018-10-11 18:55:30 Overall the report was very bearish as crude stocks rose and the pressure of the general stock market losses hits intermarket commodities. WTI is now down US$2.09/b to US$71.08/b. I expect a breach of US$70/b in the coming days.

1260 2018-10-11 18:52:27 The rise in 10-year bond yields is cited for the decline in equities.  Could this mean it doesn't make sense to blame the unevenness in stocks on the Fed, which has hiked short term rates, rather than fiscal policy and/or the effects of an improving economy on long term rates.

1279 2018-10-11 18:49:59 I did not think this would happen so quickly. You can nibble at #stocks now IMO. May have some more to go down but here is not a bad spot to start adding some buys
1280 2018-10-11 18:49:50 Well, if you look at the Dow and S&P Stocks, they are both down about 2% today. All week they have been in decline, which is not a good sign for the rest of the market. Most of this is due because of rising bonds yields, so investors are selling shares and buying more bonds.
1281 2018-10-11 18:49:21 That pudding is the best we ever tasted. We're lucky a local shop stocks it, but I'd crawl to Inch House if I had to for some 
1282 2018-10-11 18:49:17 You had to know a correction in the stock market was coming.  Rising interest rates, rising prices in oil, concerns about trade tariffs and uncertainly in the mid-term elections all are contributing factors. But the fact is stocks are over valued and a correction was overdue.
1283 2018-10-11 18:48:31 if you're looking for few points, money can be made any side, these look like strong stocks and might slip less in weak market :)

1294 2018-10-11 18:47:35 But I have been worried about stocks since the Jan/Feb $VIX-splosion, and have been actively recommending A) Raising cash levels substantially B) Rotating to defensives vs. offensives and C) Hedging risk with appropriate tools, if you're so inclined.

1417 2018-10-11 18:26:32 You have to ask Why he sides with ALL these scum bags.
My guess is it’s financially motivated.

1425 2018-10-11 18:24:53 U.S. stocks are sinking again a day after their biggest drop since February. Some early relief over a tame report on inflation gave way to renewed selling.

1427 2018-10-11 18:24:43 Bought my Amazon stocks back. Here we go
1428 2018-10-11 18:24:37 $spy International stocks keep getting cheaper. P/E now sitting ~13 while US still stands almost double
1429 2018-10-11 18:24:31 sir please publish a list of stocks which will double 

Rest we will assume will halve as per your view :)
1430 2018-10-11 18:24:20 Well how am I supposed to know that? I just got into stocks after starting in crypto. I don't know any of these people. I don't like being told that Idk what I'm doing when I'm up over 1500% in 3 months. I researched & put in the work. I don't respect ppl who blindly disrespect.
1431 2018-10-11 18:24:13 That’s always my strategy. It has to be better than buying high. Also why I’m bad at stocks
1432 2018-10-11 18:23:19 Everyone is too much into how all the major company stocks are down but don’t see that Gold is up at $35 a share  and Marijuana stocks are staying flat and stable.
1433 2018-10-11 18:23:17 Stocks aren't allowed to drop until his friends can short before he tweets something...
1434 2018-10-11 18:23:12 Tom Lee has been wrong about just about everything.  Esp crypto.  Dump stocks now and Do the opposite of what he says.
1435 2018-10-11 18:22:56 They want their wealthy benefactors to benefit from stupid folks buying stocks. The end.
1436 2018-10-11 18:22:55 Are they going to keep falling?  Should i move stocks to cash? Asking for a friend
1437 2018-10-11 18:22:48 Gotcha, so they GIVE away 1700.00 stocks, MONTHLY bonuses, how do they make money with their 566K employee's. Sounds feasible.
1438 2018-10-11 18:22:26 @realDonaldTrump is just like the company he keeps - Unhinged Kanye to the unwashed masses at his rallies. What a pathetic presidency. Well done USA! Laughing stocks #DonTheCon
1439 2018-10-11 18:21:52 I'm gonna sound horribly bearish right now, but I have to say the buys I'm liking most right now are in Canadian materials and Canadian energy. I don't think it's a lock that high-multiple tech stocks are going to bounce back quickly from this.
1440 2018-10-11 18:21:46 Why buy now? Of course Trumpsters dont buy stocks anyway
1441 2018-10-11 18:21:32 How about punishing the people actually responsible? Kenny Johnson is presently coaching. Give Pitino a show cause ban. Same with Jordan Fair. Also putting them in stocks by the YUM center would be just too. Good article by the way.
1442 2018-10-11 18:20:05 Yeah the Tech Stocks are being brutalized  I wonder why. Dow is down 300 right now.  Watch the economy they will use it as a distraction before the elections. Get our minds off the goal.
1443 2018-10-11 18:19:54 Don't miss my live appearance today on Fox Business Countdown to the Closing Bell with @LizClaman at 3:00 PM Eastern.  With Gold up 30 bucks and stocks crashing it should be a great segment!
1444 2018-10-11 18:19:36 Strong stocks/companies like $SQ is what you try to start scale into in blood baths like this ... 100 shares at a time for small baby accounts like mine ... longterm of course.
1445 2018-10-11 18:19:34 Stocks are through the floor so he trots out a rapper who clearly needs some help to blather in the Oval Office and the media is buying in on it.
1446 2018-10-11 18:17:05 Is this the right time to buy some stocks from this company?
1447 2018-10-11 18:17:02 How many of u find it logical to have high price range in options, particularly when there is no circuit limit in F&O stocks? #IndianStockMarkets
1448 2018-10-11 18:16:55 I rarely disagree with your posts, and really appreciate them, thanks. But here I think the China situation is more than just tariff wars and seem to be getting out of hand. The decoupling of US stocks from rest of the world is quite telling.
1449 2018-10-11 18:16:52 With that one caveat that really high-vol stocks tend to be horrible investments (Regardless of the  "underlying reason").
1450 2018-10-11 18:16:38 Yes, that's why I've ignored $TTFS' pre-September 27, 2016 performance--to compare two similar strategies that focus on stocks with healthy free cash flows that return cash to shareholders by way of buying back their own shares.
1451 2018-10-11 18:16:37 Stocks are rolling Donnie - the best!
1452 2018-10-11 18:16:34 @KimKardashian #fyi...not for nothing, but glamour doesn’t respect a man who supports the oppressor. Get his head right and keep him away from distracting this country with the rest of this #GarbageCircus from trump. Stocks will drop just by association. And his passcode is 00000
1453 2018-10-11 18:16:33 Stocks taking a 1/2 leg lower here, starting to winder if buyers will actually come in or do we pick up steam to the downside during last hour? $spy
1454 2018-10-11 18:16:23 People said exactly the same thing in 2002 about internet stocks
1455 2018-10-11 18:16:13  yes- it’s a fact that some crazy % of the tax cuts did go to corporations that just bought back stocks and didn’t raise wages or hire people. If you’re making more money I’m glad- it’s good to hear something positive that’s not a blatant lie parroted by Trump supporters
1456 2018-10-11 18:16:09 Expand the *real* economy to match the size of the existing currency float. This might happen more quickly with a gentler hand on the interest rate price tag gun. Imperfect as things are, though, I'm buying stocks like MAD right now!
1457 2018-10-11 18:16:01 Earnings are fine, but none of these companies are going to be taken private at these prices. 

Why is an exit strategy going public legal? What is a public shareholder’s exit strategy? The only reason stocks go up is bc compounding etfs & other leverage, supposedly bc cashQE.
1458 2018-10-11 18:15:47 $spex is a super low floater people... dont get caught chasing! #stocks #stockstowatch
1459 2018-10-11 18:15:16 wow I lost $230 a share on my Amazon stocks...
1460 2018-10-11 18:15:08 Press release indicates impressive revenues and some net income.  Much better than most penny stocks and could show real promise.
1461 2018-10-11 18:14:45 Tip - Look for stocks that get hard hit for no reason but still have great earnings going forward. These stocks in a correction phase are my “in and out” stocks. In the fall of 2000 I bought Kellogg at $23, and in 2007 sold for $53 for $30k Why? Earnings were still strong.
1462 2018-10-11 18:14:04 Way too soon for real estate or most stocks imo
1463 2018-10-11 18:13:58 बहुत बहुत बधाई आपको 
भगवान करे रोज इसी तरह कमाने का मौका मिले आपको
1464 2018-10-11 18:13:55 So sad....Trump gave them tax breaks so they have extra money.  Which if they were smart, they held on to till the market falls, then buy a bunch more stocks cheap, and they make even more money.
1465 2018-10-11 18:13:54 @MelissaLeeCNBC the bomb $FB dropped on their earnings call was not their rising expenses (were expected although Pete Najarian often makes reference to it), it was their decelerating growth projection which is a killer for high growth stocks and was unexpected.

1474 2018-10-11 18:11:21 There are many fundamental analysts on TV who make fool of retail investors by recommending certain stocks such as Tata Motors for long term investment while stock is hitting 52 week lows every other month and has corrected more than 100% in last year. Be wise in your investments
1475 2018-10-11 18:11:14 Totally agree stocks are awful and there aren’t any answers coming out of the club regarding when stocks will be replenished
1476 2018-10-11 18:10:41 @DaveRamsey @RachelCruze @ChristyBWright @KenColeman @ChrisHogan360 @AnthonyONeal can u give me some links or literature describing dividends stocks?  How do they differ from other stocks?
1477 2018-10-11 18:10:25 I was actually a heavy buyer of MJ stocks yesterday - when I saw all the reversals across the board despite the market selling off-.  Look at them all TLRY CGC CRON - all reversed hard off yesterday's morning dips.

1479 2018-10-11 18:10:20 Trump is like other politicians only more so. He's not interested in the truth other than how he can manipulate it to his advantage. He's not trying to circle the square of a "great" econ & static rates; he's trying to drive a narrative that places blame for stocks ⇩ elsewhere.

1493 2018-10-11 18:04:54 Alternatively, there is a reason why the historical average real return for US stocks was 6.5% vs. 5.5% world average...were were cheap through most of our history.
1494 2018-10-11 18:04:51 That's a step backward. Want more daylight into activities of small firms. Small cap stocks, especially penny stocks,  thrive in atmosphere low in low real information and high in speculation and innuendo. How can you raise capital of don't show clear financial results.
1495 2018-10-11 18:04:38 @AOTtrades Can someone  differentiate  between value stocks and growth stocks. All over cnbc and its rotation  between  those.

1496 2018-10-11 18:04:28 No.  I am talking specifically about common sense gun laws.  I don't think there is a blanket statement that we should follow.  Maybe new rules to cover different bullet types, and bump stocks and things that make weapons far more deadly than intended. 1)

1504 2018-10-11 18:00:32 If you followed me, you would be short Amazon from 1870.

Short overvalued tech stocks while you can.
1505 2018-10-11 18:00:16 One of the hardest things about #stocks is the reluctance to shed your losers and put that money into more viable companies. I finally exited my positions on $SIRI, $MWA, $AOBC, $WETF, $INFN, $JHG, and $FIT today for a net (realized) loss. Cheers to greener days again soon.
1506 2018-10-11 18:00:07 Well it is music and Kanye will be all giggly about it!  It keeps tRumps mind off of infrastructure, health care, gun control and bump stocks so the country has nothing to worry about!  He and Kanye are bipolar so they get all huggy and do stuff like this when they're on a high!
1507 2018-10-11 17:58:52 There aren’t any many in stocks etc?! This crypto space is fairly benign compared to the ones in other markets.  Just much smoother the way they do it there!

1511 2018-10-11 17:57:25 he said basically everything is artificial in stocks and labor, but yields will go higher.  but if things stink and yields go lower, then he can claim "told you things were not great."  His funds have sucked performance wise too, you would swear by how he talks he has hit 95/100
1512 2018-10-11 17:56:28 I think you just contradicted yourself.

"This game revolves around how easily you can just kill someone at 10" which implies consistency in early stocks, but you said "sometimes you just die" vs Marth.

1520 2018-10-11 17:55:04 Here is something nobody thinks about. On major down days like this, most major companies productivity goes down HUGE. Why? Because much of their employees are regularly taking time out to check on stock market, their company stock, and other specific stocks. Bottom line impact.
1521 2018-10-11 17:54:44 Did CNBC really just chastise @MarkYusko for saying stocks could fall 40%?

I mean, you don't have to agree with him...but to act like it's not remotely possible "given how strong the economy is"...is kinda stupid...no?

I mean, the economy was strong before the last 50% drawdown

1524 2018-10-11 17:54:14 @MikeFrancesa did you just watch Mark Yusko on CNBC? Interesting stuff about potential recession Q1-Q2 2019. He says it's a good time now to buy bitcoin, hedged stuff, and value stocks. Any thoughts?
1525 2018-10-11 17:54:11 Yep.. only natural. I posted before about this but the fundamental environment in crypto is a lot like penny stocks where there’s a quick run on news before people really digest it.

1527 2018-10-11 17:54:03 Stocks are down today.... great day to be liquid and buy the deals.
I just read they are attributing the decline to a number of reasons including the World Cup. 

THE WORLD CUP? 

Really? How is that even possible??

1530 2018-10-11 17:52:18 I think the potential rise of interest rates could be the reason for the decline. I see where most of the falls were in tech stocks but the banks held up. I always say dont spend more than you can afford to lose.

1541 2018-10-11 17:48:39 A lot of tech stocks are on sale 
1542 2018-10-11 17:48:20 A lot of retail investors just got “burned” by stocks. No way they’re going jump into a more speculative market. Insto money may be a different story. We’ll see. As always, nobody knows shit IMO.
1543 2018-10-11 17:48:08 Yes but the point of low risk index funds is they they're supposed to make more than nothing over the course of several years and be far less volatile than stocks.

1549 2018-10-11 17:46:29 Global stocks were down close to 3% on Wednesday and 5% over the past week. Is your portfolio prepared for volatility? Has your advisor talked to you about your asset allocation and have they done any planning work? 
Please message me if you want a second opinion.
1550 2018-10-11 17:46:24 Is there a pattern similar to this in other stocks from the dotcom bubble? If there's It'd be great if you can post more of them. Thanks!
1551 2018-10-11 17:46:10 I was neither vouching for the statement nor contradicting it. The pt is this is what you expect to hear when stocks have a substantial sell off.
1552 2018-10-11 17:46:05 $APHQF startin gto set up really nicely here. I've never traded OTC stocks before though so I doubt I'll actually take it
1553 2018-10-11 17:45:58 I continue to pare stocks off my watch lists that are breaking down.

1555 2018-10-11 17:45:11  you don’t look up the companies? I know penny stocks you have to check on them because a lot be bs.
1556 2018-10-11 17:44:58 Yes.  Yes they do.  Not everyone thinks like you, or like me.  But many perfectly normal and rational people care about this, and many normal and rational people who don’t own stocks are struggling in this economy.
1557 2018-10-11 17:44:48 /nhhs glds nugs mtls jic Super strong rally one of the strongest ever with /gold up $6 in rare display of strength - Most Gold stocks are up way more than stks fell yesterday an exceedingly encouraging sign lows are in as we've been saying since the lows of the last few months
1558 2018-10-11 17:43:48 #STUDY Watch-out for all those stocks I hold for 4-6 weeks, then finally exit when they come to break-even. Within the next 24 - 48 hours they will all fly 10 - 20%. If you want recent examples, $JNUG $SDS and $SQQQ.  
1559 2018-10-11 17:43:46 As I have seen your policy to sell products without proper stocks, and after consumer pays the amount you guys cancel it by saying we don't have stock.

1562 2018-10-11 17:43:05 It is 100% a human driven system. It only has value when investors feel like it. If people get nervous and dump stocks (like now) then it plummets. Could literally be based on nothing.
1563 2018-10-11 17:42:49 Yes fa too suggests same, rising yield with highest fiscal deficit of this year fr usa doesn't instill confi in stocks.Tariff r going to stoke inflation,high debt in later stage. Bond rising is enough sign fr investor (who seen 08 nd other bear market) to understand it.
1564 2018-10-11 17:42:09 Why are stocks tanking? Massive layoffs in the near future due to president Bonespurs policies. He has been riding on the crest of Obama ' s solid economic foundation and now is reaping the rewards of tearing that foundation down.

Will you please replace "China" with "the US." China is wrong. The project he was referring to is in the US, not China.

1577 2018-10-11 17:38:42 There’s no advantage other than me being able to find news and stocks faster than other traders so I can get in before the move happens. Like $TRVN last week shorting right before it dropped 50%
1578 2018-10-11 17:38:16 Dec. T-bonds dropped from 140'16 to test 136'16; 4 handles.  That makes a 50% retracement 138'16 which we saw today.  If stocks get back on track, bonds could drop like a stone, again.  A breakout above 139'00 takes out the 50% retracement and could take it to a 140'00 test.
1579 2018-10-11 17:37:55 So people are dumping stocks to buy Yuan? No comprendo.
1580 2018-10-11 17:37:14 So imagine the riot police who arrested ZCTU leaders for planning protests, when they go home they will be queuing with everyone else for cooking oil and other basic commodities.

1584 2018-10-11 17:36:40 Now is actually not a terrible time to buy stocks, especially penny stocks.

Also maybe crypto. But you know, risks. Market is way down right now. Most people seem to think it will stop plummeting soon.
1585 2018-10-11 17:36:22 Wall Street dropped on Thursday but the losses were less severe than the brutal sell-off in the previous session as a bounce in technology stocks helped limit losses.
1586 2018-10-11 17:36:09 You may want to start scanning the $GDX/GDXJ and the underlying stocks.

1589 2018-10-11 17:35:53 Didn't trump take credit for the stocks going up, yet now he blames others for it going down?
1590 2018-10-11 17:35:52 today's market action(correlation with stocks) makes me doubt it....... I would like to believe you, but... reasonable doubt
1591 2018-10-11 17:35:47 Sir, just for my info, what is the basis of selecting list of stocks as you sharing....to perform tomorrow in specific strategies like, 5min, 15min....
1592 2018-10-11 17:34:25 I think we need to research 1 hr before the market opens on which stocks will be in news fr d day ... putting a strict sl and set target fr d trade

1601 2018-10-11 17:32:03 Now the market is deeply oversold and bounces can develop though leading stocks will need new bases for proper buy points.
1602 2018-10-11 17:32:01 CLOSED FTSE100 Short at 7026. Looks so oversold on RSI and Friday tomorrow which could do anything and I suspect many Shorters could Close out for the Week which would drive Stocks up. It was a tiny Position so not Hedging much. Made 0.05% Profit LOL
1603 2018-10-11 17:31:55 the market quickly recovered that dip...I'm learning so much about playing stocks short and long. calls and stops ...but still fucking confused...long as the return section shows a + ...we good.

1607 2018-10-11 17:30:42 Finished the day a bit better than the minus 4% this morning at 3.1%.  Never thought I’d be relieved to say that.   Believe it or nor I’d five blue stocks MCL the best of those, then again I’d so many stocks down around 5%.

1608 2018-10-11 17:30:33 Not too hard to imagine with Dow plummeting 800pts and Nasdaq getting crushed money shifting from crypto to buy stocks at a low.

1610 2018-10-11 17:29:39 And/or reported growth in crude stocks was too high???  The adjustment number was also the largest this year.  Hard to make sense of the report when the numbers are this fuzzy.  Running total adjustment for the year 6.747 MMBOPD.
1611 2018-10-11 17:29:32 Tech stocks- Expect another 10-15% correction in short term. Even @ 74 rs per $ ,major IT cos struggling to convert it . Luks like IT has no future. We can only see "The END".
1612 2018-10-11 17:28:38 We would be talking about the few “undecided” voters. Do they own stocks? Follow the market? Do they think Dems would steady the market or economy more than GOP? Don’t know. But not sure state of the market would have much to do with it.
1613 2018-10-11 17:28:36 It showed that even after all the DD, shit still hit the fan. Made me appreciate grandpa stocks as ramp calls them.

1615 2018-10-11 17:28:02 Funds can be a good solution.  If you have 30 stocks it is a lot of monitoring.  If you have a few good funds you can have just a few good stocks on the side.  People seem to be either into funds or stocks.  But you can have both together.  #Cake can happen to any of us IMO.
1616 2018-10-11 17:27:12 You think you did something there? Ppwerful is different from trying to promo your artists. They are a big company, powerful one your faves company is somewhat under sm too since sm acquired stocks from othet labels. Your logic doesnt meet lol
1617 2018-10-11 17:26:45 Cryptos were also trading like biotechnology stocks in 2017 and early 2018. So if a positive news story came out specific to one or more of them they spiked a lot. So if there's a bullish enough news story then maybe but, in general, overall sentiment is very bearish
1618 2018-10-11 17:26:43 Many OTC stocks operate like this, in terms of a “check list” no dilution or small dilution relative to volume should be #1, a low float also important, PRs from management, and a key technical set up ie 5/10ema conversion , 200dSMA test /conversion, LT weekly support test etc.
1619 2018-10-11 17:26:43 Market return
In this context risk - high Beta stocks move up or down by more than the index or market of which they're a constituent

1622 2018-10-11 17:26:38 Quit deflecting to drivel and start dealing with important matters. Check the performance of stocks and bonds. Visit disaster areas while the water is high. Cut back on tariffs for a start!
1623 2018-10-11 17:26:14 It's really weird that employment income is taxed the highest in Canada. In Ontario, if you earn 50K from your job you will only take home $38K. The same amount from selling stocks and earning capital gains and you'll take home $47k. From dividends? $49k. Work less, invest more.
1624 2018-10-11 17:25:39 It is the Fed raising rates. People are shifting money from stocks to bonds. Then we the uncertainty of the mid-terms. Feel free to watch Bloomberg and CNBC.
1625 2018-10-11 17:24:57 The scary part is, if this plays out as I believe it will, you’ll have no choice BUT to be in stocks as the currency imploded.
1626 2018-10-11 17:24:29 Summary of today's USDA report:

Friendly soybeans. Acres cut more than expected. Production unchanged. Stocks 11 MB lower than expected.

1628 2018-10-11 17:22:58 #stocks that have had big runs all end with the same things as they top... Earnings and a story. When everyone knows about it, the juice has run dry.
1629 2018-10-11 17:22:57 If you have to ask, you'll never know.

You buy low when you are scared shirtless and and you know what the long term chart looks like and in the old days, book value, because most "good" stocks won't trade below book for long.
1630 2018-10-11 17:22:54 I play with competitive rule set on legal stages on netplay or GC on CRT usually, but my friends and I always switch it up with items, 7 stocks, and any stage (the way we played on 2001).
1631 2018-10-11 17:22:48 Slight problem in there as some stocks do entitle the holder to a portion of earnings? But I mean overall very good.
1632 2018-10-11 17:22:35 Good grief, We are the laughing stocks of the civilized world right now.

1654 2018-10-11 17:17:54 When you start to see more and more 2% and greater moves, either up or down, the market is likely to gap.  The downside is more risky because more stocks will participate. 

The current market is quite narrow and the leadership stocks and industries are breaking down.
1655 2018-10-11 17:17:29 Agreed. Go trade stocks and see how much leverage you need to move a position 28% in a day.

1671 2018-10-11 17:13:23 Not surprising, now that GOP has undermined ACA, given us short-term "tRumpdontcare" plans. 

GOP votes against people with pre-existing conditions. It's all going downhill fast.  Most GOP senators hold stocks in Healthcare-related industry/drug companies.  

PROFITS run USA now.

1673 2018-10-11 17:13:18 It's like the bump stock ban "Bump stocks — we're almost finished with the legal papers, bump stocks are going to be gone.". That was March. Bump stocks are *still* legal.

Think of what this does to those w/ floating % on #CreditCard debt!!
1687 2018-10-11 17:09:39 @dollarsanddata hey Nick! Really liked your post on market timing.  It would be really interesting to run the numbers for a scenario where instead of going all in or all out of stocks, using it to switch from a 60-40 portfolio to a 40-60.  That could be a great use for it.
1688 2018-10-11 17:09:32 Gold may go up if stocks decline but it is not the safe haven of the past. With inverse ETF's, inc levereged, spread bets, shorts etc, which were not around 50 yrs ago, who needs gold?  Shouldn't look at 200 yrs of gold and assume the same today?
1689 2018-10-11 17:09:32 Trump probably has stocks in those arms companies that sell to Saudi
1690 2018-10-11 17:09:19 Riiiight. The Dow lost over 800 points yesterday.  Something like the 8th largest drop in history .  You didn’t really bolster your credibility with your stocks going up comment.

1696 2018-10-11 17:08:22 Yes, #market tension and tumbles are always handwringers, but a correction after a long, steady run isn’t surprising. The volatility isn’t expected to change the Fed’s plan to continue tightening monetary policy. #Fed #stocks #SP500 #Dow

1698 2018-10-11 17:08:13 Obviously this is not relevant now to #CAKE holders.  But on Twitter etc there is always much debate about the merits of diversification.  Buffett lost all his investment on Dexter Shoes I think.  #CAKE brings home the importance of diversification.  Probably at least 15 stocks.

1700 2018-10-11 17:07:48 U.S. stocks struggled to snap the longest losing streak of Donald Trump’s presidency today in early trading as weakness in energy couldn’t offset tech strength, sending the market lower for a sixth straight day. The dollar fell and Treasuries rose.
1701 2018-10-11 17:07:48 I'd like to see an article on how big boys' algorithms determine they should sell high yield dividend earning stocks (often providing double TBill yields) vs "safe" bonds? Even stocks paying 6% plus are getting nailed. How does that make any sense?

1709 2018-10-11 17:04:39 It depends I guess how bad this US market exchange correction is, I think it will definitely  have an effect on bitcoin.  Money will go somewhere, it might even leave bitcoin and flow into stocks if they are significantly reduced in price.

Japan fell 3.9%. Chinese stocks fell 5.2% to their lowest since 2014.

1746 2018-10-11 16:52:32 Actually the rising rates that are causing investors to move away from stocks have nothing to do with the Fed.

1797 2018-10-11 16:36:43 @TeamCavuto I don't think it is a good idea to get obvious anti-Trump Democrats on air to air their stock opinions, your guest says all stocks are over valued, but the Trump-induced 40% market rise was justified by deregulation policy and corporate tax cuts

1801 2018-10-11 16:35:59 Shorting/selling has been going on for 3Q now if you haven't noticed, not just recently. Majority of stocks have gone nowhere or down since January, IRAs pathetic and Fed. contributing. Wall street agenda-based trashing, internal and external, might find out what is motive/source
1802 2018-10-11 16:35:38 A question, how your 'empirically supported' expected behavior will change if, in the next downturn, the Fed, like BoJ, decides to purchase stocks (to avoid a market meltdown - either through ETFs or directly) instead of debt securities (or simply doing nothing)?
1803 2018-10-11 16:35:22 Which pot stocks should I look into? Haven’t really been keeping up with these
1804 2018-10-11 16:35:17 No way rate hikes are to reign in stocks. There is no framework for this, & furthermore, should they "succeed", they can't control the sell-off. So I think central banks talk about financial risks from frothy financial assets but wouldn't dream of being the correction trigger

1808 2018-10-11 16:34:15 How can Pres. blame Fed for market downturn? #Fed reacts to market conditions & economic data.

1819 2018-10-11 16:32:18 let's see, higher interest rates mean borrowing money costs more so now it costs more for companies to buy their own stock back so less is bought back and stocks lose value; thus the pump has to take a break
1820 2018-10-11 16:32:10 cannot agree more. we cannot even get the material stocks to get out of a bear mkt and the idiots are talking inflation

1834 2018-10-11 16:27:24 Many retail investors who express happiness about dirt cheap price of stocks after this strong price correction are lying. Only if they sell at peak can benefit most otherwise it is start of game to earn back money. They are selling story to us about their insight.

1844 2018-10-11 16:25:01 Suddenly people are buying stocks... and it's positive again.
how timely.
1845 2018-10-11 16:24:47 On falling unemployment - US Phillips curve is dead ( Powell along these lines recently)

On rising asset prices - I take it you mean stocks. The positive impact on households is quite overstated. Look at where inflation is after several years of asset price gains.
1846 2018-10-11 16:24:42 Agree with that. However for now, with stocks and bonds getting torched, maybe there still is a place for that yellow pet rock. At least for now.
1847 2018-10-11 16:24:18 @LIZJNYshow I'm fairly new to options, but been doing stocks a couple years.  I watch you 2 ladies trade without doing any tech or fund analysis and I'm amazed. you just trade off the numbers?
1848 2018-10-11 16:23:09 Though the recent market decline is not comparable to the crash of 1987, many leading names like $SQ made similar declines as some leading stocks of 1987 did..  (% declines) $MSFT for example. So the force of selling wasn’t a joke at all yesterday
1849 2018-10-11 16:23:00 Still way up, making an adjustment. What stocks do you own?
1850 2018-10-11 16:22:49 A more complex version of "Give a man a fish..." in a way, only this is fishing out most of the local stocks, handing it all over to the local markets, then wondering why the local fishermen can't make a living any longer

1852 2018-10-11 16:22:02 FYI, if it wasn't for the CFP limiting these families to quotas they would have utterly devastated Scottish fishing stocks decades ago to increase their short term profit margins, killing local communities across Scotland.

if he puts out his views we have right to agree/disagree and trade accordingly.

1860 2018-10-11 16:20:03 Agreed, less well correlated since around May....although thrusts and drops still seems to bear some (visual) correlation to tech stocks (e.g. NAS100)
1861 2018-10-11 16:19:54 The clueless man,again. Trump is freaking out only cuz it's getting close to the midterms. The feds have only suggested doing it. It was a text stocks that took the hit yesterday.
1862 2018-10-11 16:19:38 Awesome tweet: 

Gun sales have been at record lows. Nobody stocks guns when they're not afraid some asshat will take away our rights. So Trump is the best gun control president on record. The next spike will be when these clowns run in 2019.
1863 2018-10-11 16:19:38 Trump verses the Fed.

His deficit led tax cut is exhausting itself and the tariffs are beginning to bite.

Stocks down
Dollar down
If Treasuries also get hit instead of acting as a safe haven 
1864 2018-10-11 16:19:21 except that the vast majority of stocks have been trashed all year despite good earnings/ forecasts 4 last 3Q, PEs/PEGs getting compressed lower. Factors suspected: Fed.%s up too quickly, *agenda* short/sell intrnl wall st. +/or extrnl*big$$(Soros&co), f-media*, internat. affairs
1865 2018-10-11 16:18:52 I think we are heading into deflationary bust. Stocks lower, bonds rally hard, oil tanks harder before we see inflation. Zn is going to squeeze the shit out of those shorts apart!!! Bonds in general should see a rally from here!!
1866 2018-10-11 16:18:48 BREAKING: Trump says correction in stocks has been caused by the Fed, which is out of control, too stringent and making a mistake. Trump also says he won't fire Powell, but is disappointed.
1867 2018-10-11 16:18:40 #US stocks fell for a 6th day, extending the longest losing streak of Donald #Trump’s presidency, as energy shares plunged and a rally in tech failed to lift the broader market! The $USD fell with #oil, #Treasuries rose and #gold posted its biggest gain since May 2017!
1868 2018-10-11 16:18:34 1/ I think what we are seeing is that $BTC and cryptocurrencies are not immune to broader global market movements. Most economists polled believe 2020 is the year we enter a recession. Stocks typically reflect negative movement approx 6 months prior to a recession. Taking this
1869 2018-10-11 16:18:14 The top five stocks lower at noon today are $FLR, $HII, $JEF, $DLTR, and $TDG.

1877 2018-10-11 16:16:13 Stocks mostly lower today as banks and health care companies slip, but tech recovers a little bit of its recent losses. Indexes are all over the place today, with the S&P 500 rising as much as 0.3% and falling as much as 1.4%. Right now it's in the middle, down 0.5%.
1878 2018-10-11 16:16:11 The top five most active stocks at noon today are $AMD, $GE, $BAC, $F, and $MSFT.
1879 2018-10-11 16:16:01 Why would something you can grow in your backyard be illegal? The price of legal cannabis in legal states is as much as cannabis on the street. It’s still all about the cash in sales and taxes! Cannabis stocks are pushed now but once legal and you can grow your own??

There are plenty of useful idiots and laughing stocks like Diane Abbott, but not many are just genuinely malignant enough to compare to Phillips.
1881 2018-10-11 16:15:33 Hi Tweeps! Another down day in stocks! Not a surprise to me and don't say that I haven't been hinting that this would happen for some time! Just a correction? I don't think so and I'm positioned accordingly! We'll see!

1883 2018-10-11 16:15:29 How can the Orange Buffoon know anything about stocks and shares and turning a profit? He thinks tariffs are a good thing and been bankrupt numerous times
1884 2018-10-11 16:15:14 A single day correction due to overvalued tech stocks. Nothing to do with interest rates which should start to rise in an improved economy. Ladies & gents... the President of the United States... the dumbest business grad in history. There's a record to be proud of Donnie.

1916 2018-10-11 16:08:05 Very little chance stocks can crash and BTC can rally. It’s neither a safe haven asset or SoV. Risk off is risk off. People ain’t taking their money out of stocks and sticking it in BTC.

Common mistake is to jump on the short wagon right before small bounces.

2015 2018-10-11 15:51:00 Trump says The Fed is causing the correction in stocks. In a sense, he is correct. The Fed blew this big bubble with near zero interest for many years and now they’re popping it.
2016 2018-10-11 15:50:48 Certain conservative funds always get cold feet when bond prices rise; but the fact is, there's more money to be made in stocks. There's no reason to think the market will decline for at least two years; except the extremely remote chance Dems win a few extra seats. Not likely.

2019 2018-10-11 15:49:57 TRUMP SAYS MARKET CORRECTION IS CAUSED BY FEDERAL RESERVE

Correct but for the wrong reason. By pumping the system full of monetary steroids, the Fed created a bubble in stocks of historic proportions. The inevitable correction lies at their feet.
2020 2018-10-11 15:49:51 So let me get this straight trump is admitting that the feds rate increasing are going to crash the markets which we all know. And Powell has told us that they wont stop raising rates no matter what... so why is anyone in stocks still??? Like what more do you want? @APompliano
2021 2018-10-11 15:49:46 Not to mention he doesn’t realize that the debt and the bonds needed to support it are actually paying better dividends on a percentage than stocks are.   So it’s the GOP budget process
2022 2018-10-11 15:49:40 @realDonaldTrump THE POODLE SAYS: NO ONE BELIEVES THE MARKET DOWNTURN CAUSED BY YOUR APPOINTMENT POWELL. THEY BLAME YOU FOR THE MESS WITH CINA, IT IS CLEAR TO ALL AND ALL THE NEWS CHANNELS SAY IT EVERY NIGHT. "TRUMPS TRADE WAR WITH CHINA CAUSES STOCKS TO CRASH" GOP WILL CRY!
2023 2018-10-11 15:49:32 I don't think the relation tends to be one to one. If stocks are doing poorly (outlook on large corporations for future earnings is poor), corporate bonds will likely lose value (become riskier when it comes to meeting their obligations).

Treasuries, yes, tend to gain value.

2027 2018-10-11 15:48:46 The market correction is caused by stocks going down. Duh !! He knows nothing…he knows nothing….  ;-)
2028 2018-10-11 15:48:19 I would still bet on lower rates in the future. This speed bump will slow growth and hurt stocks. the supply/demand story is not great but when stocks get whacked in earnest, i think bonds will be the place to go.

2033 2018-10-11 15:47:33 Ain’t over Yet Gene... Long Term Yields On Bonds are all the rage over Stocks, Feds will raise interest rates more to combat inflation. Look for another recession down the road soon only nothing like the one 10 years ago
2034 2018-10-11 15:47:21 Did stocks crash yesterday?
2035 2018-10-11 15:47:04 Pretty incredible statement by trump thinking stocks "crashed" yesterday. Time for SOMEONE to invoke the 25th Amendment on trump...
2036 2018-10-11 15:47:02 Stop me if you’ve heard this before: 

Stocks go up everyday for 6 weeks.
Give back all their gains over 3 days.

This market is a joke.

2037 2018-10-11 15:46:47 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to cure your bipolar disorder
2038 2018-10-11 15:45:37 So if people decide eh I should sell all my stocks so I don’t have to go through what I did in the last recession (presses sell button on iPhone) it will just get more oversold?
2039 2018-10-11 15:45:35 Kavanaugh isn't any rapist. He only rapes young pretty rich girls. Do u think those wealthy women who were raped and survived in the rich ppl's rape culture will let this go? Selling stocks from decades high is good for them anyways. Before Kav is gone, market will keep falling.

2043 2018-10-11 15:44:57 Tech stocks aren't doing too hot right now... Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google lost a combined $172 Million just yesterday. @Plaid_Cook @Plaid_Bezos I'm confident we'll all make it through though.
2044 2018-10-11 15:44:13 I had a feeling this was coming after how the market acted on Monday. So glad I pulled out and sold everything. We're in a bubble. Stocks are artificially high thanks to stock buy backs. It's just a matter of time till it pops.

2052 2018-10-11 15:43:28 Have you seen how stocks are doing? 
2053 2018-10-11 15:43:11 I've bought some small miner stocks and a clothing stock in OTCBB, but only throw a little on those after doing a lot of homework on them, they usually don't win in the long run but sometimes get bought out or larger companies will do takeovers. Risky business.
2054 2018-10-11 15:43:07 3/n.. Coming to my trade of long nifty @ 10167, i am basically a long term trend follower & prefer to go long on stronger stocks when they make new highs. But sometimes i do contra trades when there is too much exuberance/pessimism 4/n..

2065 2018-10-11 15:41:04 Obama, no doubt.

The real culprit is, of course, trump.

trump decided to stimulate an already robustly growing economy with yuge tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires.  The Fed HAD to raise rates to dampen the resulting inflation.  Stocks are now less attractive vs. bonds.

When we talk about mkt bottom something interesting came from US n Europe 
Brent in some favour near 81 but US bluechip stocks bleeding
2083 2018-10-11 15:37:43 People ask, are stocks overpriced. It's been obvious to me for a while. GOOGL & AMZN are obvious examples, but it hasn't mattered for a long time now, & buying still happened without consideration for important fundamentals.  Simply stated, their prices are about 50% too high.
2084 2018-10-11 15:37:33 So trump cuts taxes for the wealthy, they in turn buy more stocks, which increases the deficit, which makes trump look good. Smh
2085 2018-10-11 15:37:17 A lot of these a-holes counting on another bailout or more rules changes. @RaoulGMI & @ttmygh spoke about the leveraged short volatility trade spreading beyond just stocks to other asset classes in their last free Adventures in Finance podcast. @ArtemisVol also covers this
2086 2018-10-11 15:37:14 When interest rates rise, stocks drop in price.  Trump has absolutely nothing to do with this.
2087 2018-10-11 15:37:10 Well, the ATF wants to ban bump stocks. This has bipartisan support. It hasn't made any progress becuase McConnell is grabbing that Russian NRA money.  Agencies have become sloppy with reporting criminal records to the background database. We need laws to hold them accountable.
2088 2018-10-11 15:37:09 Stocks
2089 2018-10-11 15:37:03 Actually pretty chilled. As mentioned elsewhere, went long some SPY calls here, nice little chunk. Also added some long term stocks (ZUO, for instance). Feeling pretty good. This isn't "it".
2090 2018-10-11 15:36:59 And it dropped 825 pts yesterday...uh huh...buy stocks...many of the cult will.  Buy low, sell hi I guess...
2091 2018-10-11 15:36:41 I'm glad I'm to poor to lose money in the stock market. But think about many who have been forced out of pensions I to 401k stocks that are not going to enhance their retirements. And now they go after SS. Poor can work til they die.
2092 2018-10-11 15:36:23 The data was not manipulated to hide anything. It was done, as shown in the papers, to normalize data across diff measurements. (Science stuff)
Al Gore made his money in Internet stocks while advising tech companies. All proceeds from his GCC message went to charitable foundation
2093 2018-10-11 15:36:17 They have influence with their Central Bank on other central banks and 75% is invested in FF.  Paris said abandoned assets, but that means our worth (Pensions, stocks) should plummet.  Nobody is talking about this.

2098 2018-10-11 15:35:45 Stocks are continuing their Sell off this morning on worries of higher Yields.  MBS are up, currently up 11bps, on the Sell of on the Equities and the drop in Yields to 3.16% (it dropped under another floor of support).

2100 2018-10-11 15:34:52 I have an #IFTTT trigger to tell me when #Google (aka Alphabet) drops more than 5%.  Alarms went off yesterday.  Tech stocks are taking a beating (see #NASDAQ) with the overall #StockMarket following.  Has the bull finished its run?
2101 2018-10-11 15:34:52 Looking at the monthly with 10/20ema - it's clear. Time to short stocks and buy gold / silver / miners
2102 2018-10-11 15:34:44 I'm gonna become a big technical analysis guy for stocks and start saying things like "This is finding support and moving out of its 50 day window if it can just escape the fish hook".

2110 2018-10-11 15:32:58 Unfortunately, market doesn't take such things into account. 

I am not an expert, but usually bonds go up when stocks go down - it's a shift that is currently not happening, suggesting that something unusual is going on. Bonds are a form of a trust account, so this is worrisome.
2111 2018-10-11 15:32:20 It's lower than many when someone bought up 11%

It's crazy for anyone to want to hold a Chinese stock in this market. China is headed towards a recession, and China stocks have a bad name
2112 2018-10-11 15:32:02 Stocks are going DOWN fml
2113 2018-10-11 15:32:00 Stew, do you look for relative strength on crashes like this? If so, GOOGL is pretty strong today out of FAANG stocks.
2114 2018-10-11 15:31:53 On second thought.   Here you go.   84% of stocks are owned by the top 10%.  Not as much as you were expecting.   And "need" has nothing to do with the tax cuts.  Both Dems and the GOP have reduced taxes, and it always leads to an improved economy.

2165 2018-10-11 15:22:46 Does it go deeper, though?

Will sanctions on Saudi Arabia affect oil companies / stocks / profits?

Does Lindsey Graham stand to profit from any of those companies or stocks?

2167 2018-10-11 15:22:35  when people get scared, when people are on margin and get the calls, they need to sell liquid assets IE FAANG stocks. When a bear comes, look for safe assets and gold and silver at these prices are a steal imo. Cash or gold or silver. I agree @rejjie26 .  #Resources 2019
2168 2018-10-11 15:22:25 eh. thats nothing compared to this collapse in stocks.  and that entire move came at the end of day yesterday.

2172 2018-10-11 15:22:10 yes indeed!! with this market dip #ORR is one of the very few who didn’t dip much at all… quite possibly due to gold rallying. 

Time to dig into gold stocks peeps!
2173 2018-10-11 15:22:08 Yeah I know I'm overdoing gold. But my entries are OK, & I vetted all the 30+ big cap stocks I trade as viable long term holds even though I do cycle from best relative performers to worst. All stocks pros (latent buying pool) will look at at some point. Like I said, Dogs'R'Us :)

2185 2018-10-11 15:19:27 This is a great pitch for dollar cost averaging and the value created through compounding. Buy the same dollar amount of stock every month (adjusted for inflation). When stocks are down, your dollar buys more stock, and vice versa. Simple and effective.

2192 2018-10-11 15:17:35 Hi Jennifer! Historically the market has always rebounded, so if you don't need the funds immediately, my advice would be to hold. Also, to take advantage of this time by purchasing dependable stocks at a discounted rate. What are your thoughts?

2196 2018-10-11 15:16:42 There’s a big difference between a trader and a person who buys stocks in a bull mkt with a coool avatar. Trading is not easy . Trading is not fun . But you know what , if you find that edge you can exploit it . God bless . Taking few minutes off to rebalance

2206 2018-10-11 15:14:54 As I said earlier, given market structure, there's no such thing as "rational" acting Corrections anymore.  Even small ones feel like full blown crashes while they are in motion and stocks declining.
2207 2018-10-11 15:14:53 half the finance takes say there’s absolutely no reason why investors should be selling stocks, the other half are just a list of all the scary stuff currently spooking markets.
2208 2018-10-11 15:14:47 No "machine guns" have been used in more modern mass shootings. On the other hand, bump stocks have. And a "regular basis" implies a routine activity. Please, I encourage you to do thorough research on this topic. Even the definition of "mass shooting" varies from sources.

2224 2018-10-11 15:11:51 Don't have to own stocks to get horse fucked. If you have 401k or company pension you are vulnerable. If you are employed you are vulnerable because companies that you work for do own stocks. If you don't work, yeah you're golden. Food stamps will keep coming

2286 2018-10-11 15:01:09 Think big fund managers are moving in to hedge their bet because they lost half their YTD gains yesterday. It can take some time to move their money in, but i think they’ll move a lot of cash out of the stocks and into protection until at least January. 

Just my thoughts.

2288 2018-10-11 15:00:59 Yep given "market structure" now IE., specialists replaced by MM Machines, every correction even very mild ones do immense ST damage to loads of stocks.  That's "anti-capital" formation which was the main reason the original uptick rule was put in place in 1938.
2289 2018-10-11 15:00:58 Sure, the markets are down big.  The goal as an investor is to change your mindset from seeing a "loss" to seeing an "opportunity".  Stocks are going on sale - that means  you can buy some great companies at even better prices.   #mindset #investing #dividend

2294 2018-10-11 15:00:40 Totally fair. 

One could also argue "many individual stocks are down much more than the averages."

That said, I just thought it was interesting and it speaks to our acclimatization of the view that markets only go up.
2295 2018-10-11 15:00:34 You need to catch up! Tax breaks, unemployment lowest since 1969, NK talks, new NAFTA deal, 2 constitutionalist SCOTUS, manufacturing up bigly, stocks up, regulations gutted, illegal criminals deported, wall going up, America 1st, respect for USA back! Democrats r the disaster!
2296 2018-10-11 15:00:31 This just offers half baked theories with no proof. What's far worse are boiler room operations that pump and dump penny stocks. You should save your outrage for people like Jordan Belfort, who stole millions from unsuspecting "clients" using these antics
2297 2018-10-11 15:00:09 Hot air! Stocks are currently overvalued partly due to ease of access to cheap money. Speculators are jumping in and out of markets to collect their profits. Yesterdays sell off is an example of why interest rates need to go up, and fast. As To protect us from another crisis.

2302 2018-10-11 14:59:06 Not to brag but I've been investing with this mentality as well. I don't care about yearly returns as long as I'm buying good stocks at reasonable prices and adding every yr. IMO, stocks only stocks can beat inflation & tax adjusted returns on other saving instruments.
2303 2018-10-11 14:58:40 Just wait, Trump is going to say stocks are falling in anticipation of the Democrats taking the House.
Or has he already said that?

2310 2018-10-11 14:57:33 What I gather from your poll is that 29% of those who ran into your feed fail to understand that stocks are not bouncing balls of optimism but instead represent the last rung of the capital structure totem pole and sometimes are @DonutShorts that go to $0.

With monetary now at M-3, and Valuation at V-3, we personally would not buy even now.  Next.

2318 2018-10-11 14:55:01 Pretty normal really. The market is driven by emotion. Plus really high so smart players sell off pocket a nice profit. Buy stocks back at a much lower price and ride the trend again.
2319 2018-10-11 14:54:51 To earn good returns from equity, one must hold on to the asset atleast for 8 to 10 years.Daily in & out from the stocks based on prediction is just gambling.

NSE looks like "Mosul" Most of the stocks are out of shape & size along with retailers/ investors who held them, most of them are gone. FIIs came as FDIs and gone with loot, like East India Company did.
It will hit BJP very badly.

2327 2018-10-11 14:53:51 Who is allowing journalists to put out negative stories about Tesla to manipulate stocks to fall and help shorts???
2328 2018-10-11 14:53:45 You can't time the market. You can only plan accordingly for your life. Any savings for long term (5 plus years) should be in a diversified portfolio including stocks(assuming you can stomach the fluctuations). Anything with less time before needed should not be in stocks.
2329 2018-10-11 14:53:38 Romney's comment 47% of poor Americans taking advantage then in light of Trump now having given unfunded tax cuts (cost to deficit not savings) to corps w/pre-existing cond of record profits used to buy back stocks no help to 1/2 country w/pre-existing cond no savings impeachable

2337 2018-10-11 14:52:25 as for individual stocks, probably not really finding a top or bottom, it is about buying or selling when valuations get too toppy or undervalued.

2341 2018-10-11 14:51:45 ok, fair point.  But I don't think Stocks does any personalization at all, FWIW.  And, Motley Fool writes about AAPL stock a lot, so it's not such a mystery why they think you'd care..

2349 2018-10-11 14:50:01 Hi Jess. I am more into forex. Forex is the largest financial market in the world and it outperforms the stock market tremendously. Stocks is still a good idea for longer term returns though. Anyway, next Sunday my mentor is doing a free webinar and it might be gud for u to view
2350 2018-10-11 14:49:55 @BrianMasseMP  It has been reported that if you're an investor in pot stocks and disclose that to the border guards, you could be barred from entering the US. If so, what about US citizens who are invested in pot stocks? Not against the law for them?
2351 2018-10-11 14:49:32 Easy to think what you are holding is good value when really it's just better value than it was. When everything else falls then if you are holding a stock it's value is much higher relative to other stocks than it was. A falling tide lowers all ships.
2352 2018-10-11 14:49:31 The U.S. Government is not interested in gun control, regardless of the cost to human life.  Therefore, it is up to states, local governments, store owners, gun clubs, and individual sellers to make certain that no one is getting access to guns & stocks that shouldn't have them.

2358 2018-10-11 14:47:33 Everyone was congratulating bitcoin as it did not go down as US stocks slid quickly.  Unfortunately the Asian markets reminded us Bitcoin is global and likely more intertwined in the Asian markets.
2359 2018-10-11 14:47:28 Agreed- problem was many stocks that were on reasonably expensive side but growing 40% with nice fcf margins got cut in half while still beating/raising right thru it- was maddening to keep buying but did ultimately pay off for sure- ultimate timeframe arb situation

We didn't buy it at the time as we don't chase (brutal at the time), but will wait for Oct 17th to see if it falls further

2410 2018-10-11 14:34:01 Well, now that the short sellers have covered some of their positions, look for the selling to continue in names such as $BABA / Chinese stocks, weed stocks, energy stocks, to name a few areas.  Look for weed stocks to trade lower but get a slight bounce once $ACB gets us listing
2411 2018-10-11 14:33:55 @jschultzf3 floor trades never see the advantage of good dividend stocks. Or the compounding benefits of dividend reivenvesting .  But they are wrong for not using them.

2419 2018-10-11 14:32:35 The Foolish mindset for dealing with market volatility:

2423 2018-10-11 14:32:04 I really hope you two are joking... These stocks have increased a ton in Market Cap size over the last couple years. Making "The biggest dollar decline ever" irrelevant.
2424 2018-10-11 14:31:58 2/3 of stocks market wealth is owned by the top 1%

2537 2018-10-11 14:09:45 Is that why the GDP is at record highs and has set so many new records this year? Is that why unemployment is at it's lowest since 1969 and the USA has so many thousands of new jobs? The truth is Trump is a great businessman and the stocks will go back up very quickly. JUST WATCH
2538 2018-10-11 14:09:43 @AppleSupport Hi. I’m noticing the Stocks app is showing old outdated articles for news related to stocks. I compared with a friend and same issue on his phone. How/when/where does the Stocks app pull/curate news from?
2539 2018-10-11 14:09:41 Step 1. $1000 in the bank savings. Don’t touch. Step 2. 3-6 months living expenses saved. Step 3. Make investments in money market and/or stocks. Step 4. Buy $60 game
2540 2018-10-11 14:09:27 On a day like this it's nice to see #NCCL blue. Quality stocks with quality potential will always prevail. 

On that note about quality stocks check the large #SML buy. Someone got a bargain.

2552 2018-10-11 14:08:21 I have come to believe that the worst advice ever given was "buy low, sell high". Almost a guarantee of loss. Eventually, as you sell winners and keep losers (and even add to losing positions), you will have a shrinking portfolio entirely composed of stocks with declining values.

That's the thing about crypto community they love to hate on certain coins because they don't fit the anarchist description

They should stop using emotions and start worrying about their money maybe then theyd make more
2569 2018-10-11 14:05:49 After a weak start stocks had turned a bit higher at 10 a.m. Tech companies including Apple and Microsoft are recovering a piece of their recent losses. Bond yields are down, likely a relief to investors, after the Labor Dept. said consumer prices rose just slightly in September.
2570 2018-10-11 14:05:46 stocks arent clear yet either though, a failure here and this thing drops huge,  you need a pop or some good chop into a rally otherwise its going much lower

2576 2018-10-11 14:04:31 I tend to find Quality Stocks spring back fast so once things settle down we should get back the lost ground. It's frustrating but all part of the 'fun' ;-)

2651 2018-10-11 13:48:16 The USD bull case has been a pretty big failure so far. Since last Thursday, stocks have been selling off along with rising rates. And the USD wasn't green for one of those days. No safety bid. No rising rate bid.

2653 2018-10-11 13:48:07 Yeah looks that way. So many Stocks have been on nuts Valuations with fwd p/e over 25 so common. Between 2003 and 2008 almost nothing got over 20.

2663 2018-10-11 13:46:41 @realDonaldTrump It was your idea to say the President is responsible for market changes when stocks were rising. You rejected the idea that the economy and stock prices are volatile and cycle. Don’t blame the Fed or Dems now. “You live by the sword, you die by the sword.”
2664 2018-10-11 13:46:32 My stocks have been taking an L this whole week. Shit is depressing

2666 2018-10-11 13:46:01 The raise affects each associate differently, but for the most part, we're going to be making more money. Even tenure associates are getting a raise to compensate for the loss of the VCP and RSU & we're going to keep the stocks that we had already earned.

Wednesday's "rout has shaken investor confidence," Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote to clients. "That will take time to rebuild."
The Dow plunged 832 points, or 3.2%, on Wednesday. Tech stocks took a beating, sending the Nasdaq tumbling 4%

2677 2018-10-11 13:43:38 US stocks opened lower today after market sell off hits the global markets due to consumer prices rising less than expected in September.
2678 2018-10-11 13:43:31 Global stocks tumbled on Wednesday in the worst day for Wall Street in 8 months. Investors appear to be worried about rising interest rates, which make bonds more attractive, trade wars and the possibility of disappointing corporate earnings. The S&P 500 fell 3.3%, the TSX 2.24%.

2686 2018-10-11 13:42:22 It amazes me that the SEC's position essentially boils down to interpreting "protecting investors" meaning "make stocks never go down" rather than "Attempt to make a fair and fraud-free market by removing bad actors".
2687 2018-10-11 13:42:11 Didn't @Ripple_Me_This predict an October Crash a while back 

Looks like we got 2 crashes for the price of one (crypto & stocks) 

Let's hope the other predictions Sam has made based on the Info he has comes true  & If they don't It's no problem I'm just enjoy the ride 
2688 2018-10-11 13:42:07 A lot of people think that if stocks go down those people will come to #crypto, I wouldn’t bet on it

2726 2018-10-11 13:34:51 *stock market drops*

World: Panics and sells. 

Me: Time to use that stash of money I had saved to buy those overpriced stocks.
2727 2018-10-11 13:34:50 Throughout the post-2008 era, anytime stocks collapsed, money rushed into bonds.Not  anymore. Indeed, the bond market is now collapsing ALONG with stocks.  The yield on the most important bond in the world, the 10-Year US  Treasury, has broken its multi-decade trendline.
2728 2018-10-11 13:34:42 Yesterday I was staying cool with the market sell off and bought some stocks discounted. But damn was that crazy.
2729 2018-10-11 13:34:30 this year #BTC will not  bullrun in December like 2017 because  #stocks profit is poor and cause exchanges are manipulated. This is my call.
2730 2018-10-11 13:34:29 If everyone is watching the same lines those lines are the most efficient point to influence prices for maximum effect.

If you don't believe such manipulation is a real thing a) welcome to stocks b) try to play small until you get a feel for it.
2731 2018-10-11 13:34:16 Historically, when stocks collapse as they did yesterday,  the bond market rallies. Not yesterday.  Both stocks AND bonds finished  the day DOWN.
2732 2018-10-11 13:33:20 It's easy, take the gtd 1 million and invest. I can turn that 1 million into an absolute fortune with stocks.
2733 2018-10-11 13:33:16 I can't remember off the top of my head and the data won't let me go back that far again, but I believe it saw -8K several times. At the time 499 of 500 stocks in the ES were down
2734 2018-10-11 13:32:51 Stocks open a smidge lower. Not too bad. But what will happen the rest of the day?

2745 2018-10-11 13:28:08 Under Soetoro, the FED kept interest rates near zero in order to flood cheap money into the stock market.  So, while Soetoro was shipping our jobs overseas, and unemployment was rising, they made the economy look good with stocks going higher.

2751 2018-10-11 13:26:14 Money will be shifting now from DOW to Tech stocks.....just watch.  This is all a game!!!!
2752 2018-10-11 13:26:06 No. I don’t think the Fed is crazy. At some in the next 10 years, you would hope that there was a return to a “normal” interest rate environment where the returns are more competitive with stocks.
2753 2018-10-11 13:25:51 Oof, yesterday was pretty crazy day for stocks. Keep up the great work on the benim channel, love the videos.
2754 2018-10-11 13:25:13 If you are in your 20's and investing in stocks, what are the chances you would know about risk management, position sizing, judicious use of margin and keeping emotions in check?
2755 2018-10-11 13:25:08 Not a single Democrat wanted to or wants to disarm US citizens either.  Again, a propaganda lie.  Stronger gun control, elimination of bump stocks? Yes.  There are enough guns in this country for every man, woman and child.  Your guns are fine.
2756 2018-10-11 13:24:49 Pick 2 stocks and avg in slowly during this mess. For me $FNKO and $PAGS are most intriguing. $SQ I have since $20. Would add sub $55.
2757 2018-10-11 13:24:43 I recall back in 1999 when earnings growth was slowing an equity analyst said to me, "Don't worry, tech stocks will keep doing well, as most don't have any earnings." Now people are telling me #bitcoin is a safe haven because, unlike most assets, it isn't backed by anything. Huh?
2758 2018-10-11 13:24:41 No housing crisis in AZ! Values going up steadily.  Home ownership is up nationwide.  DOW needed a day of mild correction for IT stocks.  If a strong economy is prospering, what is?

2769 2018-10-11 13:22:03 Trump was crying about the bear markets, except weed and gold stocks were smoking.
2770 2018-10-11 13:21:38 “While stocks last” so they have 20 copies to give away and this is just a or stunt to get people talking. And it worked.
2771 2018-10-11 13:20:28 What a turn of events. #stocks #investing 
2772 2018-10-11 13:20:28 I guess for stocks, yes. But if you consider forex, then shorting one is going long on the other side. Eg shorting GBP/USD is going long USD/GBP. I guess just depends your reference point.

2776 2018-10-11 13:20:06 Mi amigo Myland would be OK buying tech stocks now while they took a dive and will gain in the short term in a brief recovery. Down the road he will sell them for a gain and consider buying something for the coming economic disaster
2777 2018-10-11 13:19:52 My theory, nothing to do w interest rates (bonds still not that attractive). Run up in stocks 16/17 was promise of overseas money coming home tax free being used to reward shareholder. Done.

2781 2018-10-11 13:18:54 There is cash out there and locking in 2.25% for a year is dismal and inflation is over that number. So the money has to go somewhere. And it goes back into stocks but much more slowly than it ran out.  This battle between stocks and bonds still hugely favors stocks.

2788 2018-10-11 13:17:06 The Dow falling is not that important. The important [art of that is not that stocks fell, it's that Bonds were also hit. That indicates a much deeper worry than the stock market.
2789 2018-10-11 13:16:50 [JusSay'n] Losers on stocks stay losers, they don't bounce back. Only averages "bounce back" which obscure investment losses within the current average activity. Investors may have some kind of hedge but that does not erase the loss. ...

2805 2018-10-11 13:14:56 Why stocks go down faster than they go up? Well it’s the movement of masses and computers at the same time. The algos are set to sell at certain levels. Humans lead the selling then the computers follow. This creates a cascade of poor decisions.

2813 2018-10-11 13:13:58 US stocks suffered their worst loss in more than eight months as shares of once high-flying technology companies led a broad sell-off amid concerns over rising US interest rates.

BE A BUYER OF EQUITIES TODAY.  STOCKS ARE ON SALE NOW WITH STEEP DISCOUNTS.
2824 2018-10-11 13:12:10 trump wants you to hold stocks even though world economies are collapsing ....republicans need a strong stock market to help in the elections...he wants the federal reserve to keep interest rates low....even though inflation is heating up...will federal reserve cave-in?

2907 2018-10-11 12:48:28 #Stocks #StockMarket When a POTUS pushes ban policies (stifling int'l tourism), creates a $1+tril deficit, publicly admonish & threatens Fed independence, starts a trade war (w no plan or exit strategy) & lies profusely, wha cha get? An uncertain, jittery & falling market. @cnbc
2908 2018-10-11 12:48:05 Friendly reminder: Stocks go up. Stocks go down. They do neither in a straight line. Control risk. Wait for stocks to come to you. Have your watch list prepared. Buy great co's run by great people for the long haul. $SPY #STOCKS #investing

2916 2018-10-11 12:45:36 How do you think bankers became mega rich during the Great Depression ? They forced stocks to go down so they can buy them at penny’s off the dollar once people sold them.
2917 2018-10-11 12:45:11 Looking to buy after the market opens and settles down... lot of bargains in tech stocks

2920 2018-10-11 12:44:51 So y’all got any stocks yet?
What’s some good ones for now?
2921 2018-10-11 12:44:51 No, this is a result of artificially inflated stocks, based on mass hysteria, instead of sound investment principles.  Tax cuts will pay for themselves as they always have. And help the middle class.
2922 2018-10-11 12:44:49 Yeah! Let‘s be prepared to benefit of more attractive price levels. which stocks do you have an eye on?

2927 2018-10-11 12:43:22 'Stocks fall on profit taking' is business journalese for 'The temperature is falling because it's getting colder'
2928 2018-10-11 12:43:18 I don't pray at all because prayer accomplishes nothing other than deluding myself into thinking I'm doing something.

Instead I act.  I divest from fossil fuel stocks, I drive an EV, I compost, I have solar panels on my roof, I vote #Democrat, and more... I act.

2933 2018-10-11 12:42:12 "And 140 of those stocks are already down more than 20 percent from their 52-week highs, and that means that they are officially in bear market territory."

2936 2018-10-11 12:41:56 Mkt reacts to Fed’s actions/comments. Responsible management is not making comments like “stocks are overvalued” and “multiple hikes are needed.” Those sound like Fed wants to control the mkt and it’s not Powell’s swim lane. Just balance moves so it doesn’t kill us all at once.
2937 2018-10-11 12:41:43 "At this point, 330 out of the 505 stocks that make up the S&P 500 are already more than 10 percent below their 52-week highs.

That means that about two-thirds of all S&P 500 stocks are officially in correction territory."
2938 2018-10-11 12:41:37 They should have done that earlier to safeguard stocks
2939 2018-10-11 12:41:24 Down 800 yesterday.  Most of the stocks are getting hammered today.  Dow is flat for the year!

2942 2018-10-11 12:40:25 why on earth anyone would think crypto/btc is a "safe haven" during a down-phase in stocks is beyond me. Risk-on people. Just pull up any comparative chart between BTC and SPX, etc and its clear as day.

2949 2018-10-11 12:38:48 Crypto is correlated with tech stocks not precious materials such as gold, despite what people believe Bitcoin != digital gold.

They’re basically saying to ‘normies’ don’t get involved with the market unless you value stocks at what corporations want you to believe is their worth.
2951 2018-10-11 12:37:32 @realDonaldTrump Postage stamps going up just like everything else. Gas is up and stocks are down. You’re leading the country into another recession. Deficit is up. Worst than Bush. @maddow @CNNPolitics @coleyworld @EdKrassen @MichaelAvenatti

2956 2018-10-11 12:36:34 stocks are not overly over valued right now  earnings wise a lot of these companies are trading at realistic multiples  now maybe the tariffs etc might affect future earnings & we will start to hear about that next week when earnings reports for the 3rd q come in
2957 2018-10-11 12:36:02 No,  investors and rich people don't want the Fed to end their party. They want middle class to subsidize stocks with inflation and government debt.
2958 2018-10-11 12:35:45 US #CPI +0.1% in September both on headline and core fronts, missing estimates of +0.2%; on a year-over-year basis, headline CPI was 2.3% vs 2.4%, down from 2.7% last, while core CPI was unchanged at 2.2% but below 2.3% expected

2960 2018-10-11 12:35:21 Its like all indian stocks looks at sensex/nifty while they themselves look at dow/nasdaq/shangai etc. I think regulators should remove indices, so that everyone looks at the company/sector they own.
2961 2018-10-11 12:34:10 I got some money in stocks right now, I want to be active or at least get positions that will pay me a dividend. Where can I get more knowledge? If y’all say google or YouTube I’m blocking you
2962 2018-10-11 12:33:45 Because the feds raised interest rates and also most of the losses were in tech stocks that are not meeting projected earnings. You are a business man you should understand this oh wait you and your brother run a ponzi scheme swindling people out of their money.
2963 2018-10-11 12:33:33 Stocks such as JNJ was not nearly as affected.  Not a significant drop from 53 to 30s in 2008 compared to other stocks during the crash
2964 2018-10-11 12:33:32 I think they got them in earlier than usual, just to be sure. Imagine if we had 10% fall in #stocks with such a fake... I mean strong economy. They might just catch on that its all not real.

2967 2018-10-11 12:32:38 I made a similar point about dollar cost averaging on your last instagram point. I’d rather just invest a fixed amount into an S&P 500 ETF every week than trade stocks daily.
2968 2018-10-11 12:32:32 How does a steepening of the yield curve while simultaneously seeing stocks decline make sense while we are still in an economic boom? I don’t really see the sense in that
2969 2018-10-11 12:32:29 Time to stay in market. Buy more. Billion stomach needs food and consumables. Stocks remain best asset class. Just ensure you are in good quality stocks.

2972 2018-10-11 12:31:25 CPI is out. And the headline and core increases were a bit lower than expected. Inflation fears may recede a bit. Could stocks actually wind up bouncing back today?

2976 2018-10-11 12:30:43 Stocks are a bubble.  Rates can't stay low and subsidize stocks forever. Trump wanted credit for record highs he's going to get credit for major losses.
2977 2018-10-11 12:30:42 Analysts suggest markets are concerned about ongoing trade war with China, with tech stocks especially hit hard. For the president, after blaming the Fed, a shrug of the shoulders:

“Actually, it’s a correction that we’ve been waiting for for a long time.”
2978 2018-10-11 12:30:27 @CNBC Idiots. When tech stocks triple, quadruple, and so on, under Trump, what do you expect?  Retail "investors" will wish for dull organic growth under Obama unless they've taken profits.

3004 2018-10-11 12:22:42 The interesting thing is that we've just barely seen the first break off the peak...a lot of stocks have been pummeled in a very short period of time, thus if the short-side is real this time around, we're just getting started...

3027 2018-10-11 12:15:18 Why only trade US stocks, anyways?
3028 2018-10-11 12:15:06 And now it’s crashing fast. Can we credit you for that too? You can’t take credit for the momentary highs and stay silent went the lows hit. My stocks lost $500 in value today.
3029 2018-10-11 12:15:03 @SenSanders The only way everyone can benefit from the wage hike if stocks/bonuses are removed: Amazon must return the 6 month raises we had previously earned. Top out pay used to be $2.50 above base pay. If base pay is now $15, top out needs to be equally increased to $17.50
3030 2018-10-11 12:14:52 There was beforehand knowledge of WTC attacks. Someone made huge profits by insider trading and buying put options on stocks which actually fell after markets opened after 1 week. And, why did WTC 7 fall down hours after actual attack without any reason at all.
3031 2018-10-11 12:14:26 Don't think investors are blind to this, a breakdown of correlations between stocks and bonds isn't exactly a new phenomenon. But if an actual recession hits, those Treasurys will come in real handy. Unless there's stagflation a la 70s-80s, which seems unlikely
3032 2018-10-11 12:14:23 What do you know about checks? You can’t relate to the working class. You are destroying the retirement dreams of thousands of baby-boomers. You are destroying our economy!!! Have you seen the stocks? You need to resign!!!!!
3033 2018-10-11 12:13:57 Still 100% cash. Never know when periods like this may occur so getting defensive last week was the right choice - many stocks that I ran on the way up are down 20% or more. However, I didn’t short and that represents some missed opportunity too - something to study/work on next.
3034 2018-10-11 12:13:49 Blah blah about unemployment stocks etc unless declaration is framed that #45's and current congress' policies have NOT interfered with a trajectory that began years before #45 came into office. So credit for doing nothing to get in the way. That's how one should say it.
3035 2018-10-11 12:12:33 Promoting brands like Paco Rabanne

& Many more, rush while stocks last!
3036 2018-10-11 12:12:19 But, no one is buying Chinese stocks so apparently they are all waiting for them to get cheaper. No reason to rush in at these valuations. Plenty of other emerging  markets stocks to buy.
3037 2018-10-11 12:12:01 This is also a stocks and shares ISA so if you want to open a Freetrade ISA, you can’t have opened or contributed to your Vanguard one this tax year. 

Next tax year it all resets though and you can open a new one with us!
3038 2018-10-11 12:11:27 $spx..AAII bullish sentiment fell like a rock. I will probably look to buy some stocks for a quick bounce.

3058 2018-10-11 12:02:30 Think about it. Cheap stocks need a push to get thier numbers going again. They get that when there is a boom. When economic growth slows, you go into secular growth named who can grow regardless of economy.
3059 2018-10-11 12:02:18 Better to buy stocks that WILL go up. And short ones that WILL go down.

3069 2018-10-11 12:00:11 Actually the bull market running started in 2008. The bull market is largely shared caused stocks to rise. Btw that's the Bush administration's.  And no it is not fair based on one days worth of trading
3070 2018-10-11 11:59:54 Stock buybacks return. We are currently in the “black-out”period for US corporate stock buybacks ahead of earnings seasons. Remember, one of the biggest buyers of US stocks since 2009 have been themselves. With earnings season starting this Friday we will see a return of buybacks

3087 2018-10-11 11:55:14 The blame game never works you should always have a financial cushion for these hiccups like buying GOLD with some of your profits and put it away for a rainy day or for a few decades. There will always be corrections in the markets, especially with FANG stocks.

3096 2018-10-11 11:52:49 I think the problem is not the market is down 3% fromATH, it’s that the stocks people have poured into are down >30%. And they got in late.
3097 2018-10-11 11:52:28 IThe price action can be explained by tax loss selling in big caps. Bitmain has loads of $EOS, $LTC, and $BCH on their balance sheet that is marked at COST. Iit makes good business sense to sell, take the tax loss, buy back in 30 days, and carry the loss forward. Same in stocks.
3098 2018-10-11 11:52:12 10 years ago this time Lehmann just failed and things seemed hopeless. But if you invested in stocks back then you've had the best run ever.

3102 2018-10-11 11:51:22 @realDonaldTrump so when stocks are up, it is your doing, but when they are down it is the Federal Reserve's fault? You are certifiably insane.
3103 2018-10-11 11:51:19 When the stock market is up by even 1 point Trump, little Donnie and Fox give Trump all the credit. 

When it drops, it's not his fault. He will find some way to blame Obama or the Democrats for the stocks performing bad.

3146 2018-10-11 11:42:19 @dragon_stocks this is one of those times when, for the most part, both bears and bulls with lose money. Neither short nor long positions offer any significant probability right now. I’m 100% cash. Let the market form the bottom. I’ll be ready then
3147 2018-10-11 11:42:14 Risk stronger through Lon to #USD and #JPY but will we see a hold through the #US session
#Stocks lower, #US30 -130 #GER30 higher after a 98 pt move lower.

3148 2018-10-11 11:42:02 Is China now exporting its industrial slowdown and bear market in stocks?  Remember trade represents 60% of global GDP, China is second largest economy and we started a trade war with them, whatever its longer term merit.

Meltdown was caused by mortgage yes. Plus short trading of stocks. No country has changed its mortgage system even after crash.

3160 2018-10-11 11:38:49 Why do stocks fall by a lot sometimes?

Because sometimes they rose too much

And why do stocks rise by a lot sometimes?

Because sometimes they fell too much

Repeat as necessary
3161 2018-10-11 11:38:49 That is a good question Wan...depends on how the flows are moving.  Is the money from stocks moving out of US and overseas?  Is overseas money moving into US bonds due to crash?  It is difficult to paint each 800 point scenario with the same brush.
3162 2018-10-11 11:38:11 Prior to this week’s sell off, tech stocks were up 18% (YTD). A pullback should not surprise anyone. #StockMarket #WealthManagement #stocks
3163 2018-10-11 11:37:56 As always, people desperately trying to fix a story to a move. Plus ca change. What I find even stranger is the amount of apparently credible people talking about stocks tanking. A 600+ Wall St move may sound a lot but a few percentage points retracement is hardly a crash.
3164 2018-10-11 11:37:56 Buying stocks won't cause much more inflation by the current CPI measure. The US government could 'just' buy stocks right from the NYSE or NASDAQ and increase public wealth and government net worth.

3168 2018-10-11 11:37:14 It seems like a lot of stocks dropped yesterday on some outlier shit
3169 2018-10-11 11:37:04 Perhaps now we learn that “I buy stocks that go up” is not a robust investing strategy
3170 2018-10-11 11:36:43 Maybe the BOJ wants to buy some stocks internationally as well,  while they’re at it. We “need” it.

3187 2018-10-11 11:33:33 Good job Captain Finance! Except, 401k’s are also made up of mutual funds and annuities. Irony of this is that the younger folks 401k accounts are the ones mostly based in stocks. So you’re not seeing anyone you don’t like losing money. For most of us 401k’s are a pay raise.

3192 2018-10-11 11:32:11 A few in my timeline had already dumped all their stocks preferring to keep cash as a buffer to the certainty of another market 'correction'
3193 2018-10-11 11:31:10 We need stadium stocks as well to make it complete.
3194 2018-10-11 11:31:06 I usually support your crusades and I’m certainly no day trader but I think a ton of stocks took massive hits the past day or so which would mean it’s bigger than the CK outrage. BTW @Nike shoes suck, and did way before this CK thing.
3195 2018-10-11 11:30:58 First of all I'm not trying to get anyone out of office so your generalizing is ridiculous & I was for Bernie so bringing up Hillary also ridiculous. Don't CARE she lost. I CARE about my country my kids grandkids environment. My stocks plummeted yesterday. I CARE about USA.  FU

3197 2018-10-11 11:30:10 For those that don't think the tariffs are negatively affecting the economy: enjoy your tumbling stocks and rising interest rates.
3198 2018-10-11 11:29:40 Of course they can avoid them. Chinese stocks still sliding. If they fall another 50%, it could get interesting. But, for now, not cheap enough. I am looking elsewhere for deals.
3199 2018-10-11 11:29:31 I understand well what is happening and it was overdue but there are babies and bathwater at moment. To contextualise oneself and other stocks then for example Smartspace software trades at 80p in the £ of cash and has a recurring existing business of £1m ebit.

3222 2018-10-11 11:21:56 Thanks!
3223 2018-10-11 11:21:44 It's less about panic in stocks leading to a pump in crypto to me and more about Bitcoin becoming a regular (small) portion of most major hedgefund portfolios. If 5% of managed funds move into Bitcoin to reduce overall volatility for their clients, that will send $BTC skyward.
3224 2018-10-11 11:21:22 While I don't personally invest in stocks I believe my Life Insurance policies, pensions, banking, mortgage, and other financial assets are in some way impacted by the rise and fall of stocks.
3225 2018-10-11 11:21:14 Sentiment is very poor. The stock market should be near a st bottom. It´s clear - we have no proof of a bottom yet. Any upmove could be a correction wave with new lows following. FANG ist still to avoid!! Special situations is to prefer. Avoid  "mania" stocks showed huge wins..

3234 2018-10-11 11:18:18 Well about £15m has traded in #UKOG since #SOLO's last Holdings RNS. They had about £4.3m stock left to sell.

3236 2018-10-11 11:18:02 since the wealthy control the majority of stocks I believe you are right. the manipulations are everywhere and apparent to even dumb laymen.  sell at a top, create false panic and then buy back when the fear takes hold. it's worked for decades....

3260 2018-10-11 11:09:57 I’m struggling to understand why so many O&G stocks are down today.
FTSE down, but does that warrant such moves?
3261 2018-10-11 11:09:47 Um yes just last month I heard some brainiac say the booming economy and rising stocks was because of Obama.  So this has to be as well by their logic.
3262 2018-10-11 11:09:46 Now when to get back in those three stocks?
3263 2018-10-11 11:09:13 As the Fed raises rates, investors have been getting out of bonds, driving down their price & driving up their yields. Suddenly, the return on bonds has become competitive with some stocks — particularly risky tech stocks.

3266 2018-10-11 11:07:38 I share ur opinion sir. Just kidding. Im extremely bullish on crypto and extreme bearish on stocks. Just think there will ve a transition time(read dump on crypto as well) before money will go from stocks to crypto.

3271 2018-10-11 11:06:20 Unemployment, and interest rates low, stocks running. The Fed will NOT let u get too comfortable, hence the threats of rate hikes & stocks plummeting. Take yourself out of their game, join the #cryptomovement This is not about getting rich quick. It’s about regaining our control.
3272 2018-10-11 11:06:14 Trump has broke his arm patting himself on the back about the stock market gains, so expect some action soon.  This break in stocks is the best thing farmers could have happen in my opinion.

3302 2018-10-11 10:48:50 Not familiar with geoecononics.  But I do know that even tho this has been in the making for 25 years that the dems will blame Trump.  He told us there will be a recession. I recommend people get w/financial advisors before dumping stocks.
3303 2018-10-11 10:48:45 interesting action in Gold - flight to "quality" - i think likely a set-up before final swan dive- because at the end of the day, gold stocks are still stocks and all boats rise and fall with the tide.  And that is how the Big Boys shake them out of the hands of the little guys

3308 2018-10-11 10:46:01 If the US equity rout resumes today, it will be interesting to see if Trump escalates his "Blame the Fed" narrative, and how (if?) the Fed reacts. I suspect even a small hint of braking the rate hikes will save stocks (for now, at least) and also launch gold towards $1300 again.

3421 2018-10-11 10:01:37 Spot gold hit a low of $1160 a few weeks ago. Which is probably very close to the mining costs. The cartel already slayed gold and silver to prop the dollar. Yesterday stocks were dumped to support treasuries imo. The cartel dumped btc because btc cannot look stable to investors.

3449 2018-10-11 09:47:56 Since the Dow has dropped more than 800 points, it seems that the stock market predictors are no more than a crap shoot.

3456 2018-10-11 09:43:38 Worth reiterating the importance of stop losses.  Had a real lesson today with several stocks stopped out, saving me a lot.  I’d set these up a while back after a re-read of the Risk section in Mark’s book.

3460 2018-10-11 09:42:52 It is not the high interest rates nor is it the overvalued stocks today. Today’s terrible futures in the market is completely due to an irresponsible president shooting his mouth over the fed chairman
3461 2018-10-11 09:42:42 Tip toeing back into mkt. However only used up miniscule amount of cash and as the cash % goes up as stocks fall I am still 53% cash. Expect another leg down when USA opens. As I slowly built cash from 20 to 54% over the year feels appropriate to very slowly move back in.
3462 2018-10-11 09:42:04 Overvalued #AIM stocks being punished more than most today. Undervalued stocks like #Star #Starcom holding firm.
3463 2018-10-11 09:41:50 With stocks having topped and #bitcoin bottomed and approaching longterm logarithmic upward trend in addition to Bakkt launch nearing this is starting to become a very bullish scenario.
3464 2018-10-11 09:41:39 Remember in an inflationary environment there is no investment that can beat inflation. Neither stocks nor bonds can beat it.  The only thing you can do is try to keep up. And stocks tend not to keep up nearly as well as bonds.

Most investors have had a flat year with returns below inflation! (Core CPI 2.2%)
3469 2018-10-11 09:38:21 The question remains: Now that Wall Street has come to believe that this systematic change is under way (see P/E ratio of tech stocks), are upcoming shifts already priced in?

3477 2018-10-11 09:32:58 Snap's stocks have lost about 69% of value.

Can they turn it around? 

Perhaps.
3478 2018-10-11 09:32:56 That’s a fair point @dlefcoe I’ve a long term perspective & mainly in value stocks. As mentioned though, I’m adding back tentatively rather then gung-ho. I felt each offered considerable value before the market sell-off & most are -20% cheaper now.

3496 2018-10-11 09:22:44 Amen, DP. I can't believe the amount of coin I get paid to run models and build valuation tables and pick stocks based on the results. I'm a fucking idiot with a State college degree and an MBA from a world renowned business school but that was out of sheer necessity to get hired
3497 2018-10-11 09:22:22 In other news, my stocks are fucking going nuts 
3498 2018-10-11 09:22:15 I repeat. The condition where we get both higher long-term interest rates and lower stock prices (absent an inflation surge) is self-limiting. If tighter Fed has damaged the economy, rates will soon come down. If it hasn't, earnings will be OK and stocks will stop falling.
3499 2018-10-11 09:22:13 Tho a tremendous amount of those stocks have been bought back in buy back programs. But usually August is the month for that. Either it took Wall Street a while to see that, or there’s something else going on. Time will tell.

3502 2018-10-11 09:21:43 Learning:

IF stocks do well on days like today, their management is either very good or very bad. Easy to figure out.

3509 2018-10-11 09:16:31 If you have some cash then its irrational markets like these when you should be putting it to use in cheap undervalued stocks. You make money by doing the opposite of the herd. So buying when everyone is fearing a bear market is a smart strategy.

3583 2018-10-11 08:42:05 Jim - this sell off was sparked by a Fed Chair’s poor and rookie use of his platform/pulpit.  Is this not overdone? The parity/equity between interest rates and stocks is no longer there. In fact bonds sold off as stocks did. What is driving that paradigm?
3584 2018-10-11 08:41:55 Our stock market may be tumbling now , but soon it’ll rise. It’s all just temporary effects from the major selling of US stocks and the Trade War between US & China. Soon it’ll be a good time to start buying back

3631 2018-10-11 08:17:34 Doesn't the EU's policy explain that? CFP encourages large factory ships to hoover up the bounty so that small businesses cannot compete, and catching and discarding fish dead still depletes stocks. But with a better policy fishing communities could rebuild themselves, no?
3632 2018-10-11 08:17:12 This. Same with growth predictions for GDP.

3641 2018-10-11 08:14:24 Agreed - remains a risk-on asset. Encouragingly though, widespread expectation of "recession/crashes" in stocks is exactly what's needed to fuel another leg higher in stocks

How would it look if BTC (and with that, all the other crypto) was in green after the worst day in stocks for months.....

A bright shining star to lead the way is not wanted by some.

Wait for inflation and increased interest rates.

When retail investors enter they exit after taking their targeted profits.
3650 2018-10-11 08:10:27 in this case, do you think stocks market drop or news related to china´s bitcoin control over 70% have contributed more? I know we always try to understand or give a reason why....sometimes is more simple = More sellers than buyers.
3651 2018-10-11 08:10:15 The fear of rising interest rates, of the Italian crisis and the unresolved trade conflicts. Before the beginning of the reporting season, profit-taking should have played a role as well. Do you think Cryptomarket will ignore this?...

3765 2018-10-11 07:21:22 #Stocks,#Indexes The last SPX bottom-signaled rally (see chart) ended with a top signal, that of 10.09.  The current bottom signal is of comparable fidelity to the prior, leading to the expectation the imminent rally will also end with a top signal.

3884 2018-10-11 06:33:32 Stocks plunge, plunge, plunge #DesperateDon Huge declines all due to your childish irresponsible approach to trade and tariffs. American economy is going to suffer. You’re cornered with nowhere to go without losing face. Clearly negotiations are not your strong suit. Wonder why?
3885 2018-10-11 06:33:25 I fear for anything that’s not currently fully funded in this market.  Most stocks going below placing price recently.

3899 2018-10-11 06:26:47 You really think they'll pay ANY of those taxes when they have already admitted to using the cuts on buying back stocks? When they store profits in tax havens to avoid paying taxes on them? You are a subhuman fool that will never care about anyone but yourself.
3900 2018-10-11 06:26:37 Very unlikely in my opinion. The financial markets fluctuate and are manipulated far less than cryptoassets at the moment. 
There has actually been some correlation between NYSE and cryptoassets market cap in 2018. When tech stocks suddenly drop, cryptoassets tend to follow.
3901 2018-10-11 06:26:23 This one just makes little sense to me. I like China’s growth potential more over the next 5 years (BABA specifically) and the fundamentals are even better than their US counterparts. They were trading evenly which made sense and now China died. Gimme China stocks please
3902 2018-10-11 06:25:43 $BTC dropped with the stock markets? I expected $BTC to gain momentum when the stocks decreased but oh well.
3903 2018-10-11 06:24:53 For one, higher interest rates means bonds pay out bigger streams of interest to investors, which makes fixed-income investments a legitimate alternative to stocks. In short, "there's more competition for stocks”.

Expect a down break of 5800 in Bitcoins, creating a “death spiral” in crypto and tech stocks alike. Semiconductors worst!!
3909 2018-10-11 06:22:20 Tech companies, including the so-called FAANG stocks -- Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet -- have been market darlings. So when a sell-off gains steam, the stocks with the biggest gains are among the ones that investors sell first to lock in profits.

3914 2018-10-11 06:20:40 Morning everyone. Today we're reporting on low blood stocks in Nottingham @NHSBT Find out more with us on @bbcemt donors are needed.
3915 2018-10-11 06:20:16 So I had money stashed away for almost 4 months before pulling it out of savings (or in this case, stocks) because I need cash. That is a new record for me. It was only $60, but still. For 4 months, I was a responsible adult beginning to prepare for retirement.
3916 2018-10-11 06:19:55 Funny how the jobs, stocks, economy at large is growing and you people still believe CNN.
3917 2018-10-11 06:19:11 Isn't it funny how the whole stock market is having a bad October...  So is WWE?  There is more to the stock market than many know.  Sure, the TV deals and International money is boosting the WWE price and IT SHOULD...  But all stocks are very high right now.  Low interest rates.

3924 2018-10-11 06:14:32 Well by all means Jaitley has been a total disaster as a FM. Imposing LTCG on MFs and stocks just triggered exodus of FIIs. Result- Rupee fell like a stone and now we are in a crisis with oil imports.

3938 2018-10-11 06:09:25 Could well be.     However, I can imagine the narrative could come from the stocks selling hence the bid in the UST.  Little bit of regime change.   Anyways, we‘d better off having an open mind.
3939 2018-10-11 06:09:18 The question of how the crypto market behaves, should we get a stock market crash, has officially answered by itself!

3944 2018-10-11 06:05:14 In 2008 the bubble was more or less limited to the property market. In 2018 the bubble is in Stocks; Bonds; and Real Estate. This is the Everything Bubble. Global debt is double what it was in 2008 - Esp margin debt. Interest rates are lower too. THIS WILL BE MUCH WORSE

3950 2018-10-11 06:02:20 I forsee a Worldwide Financial crisis between now and the end of 2020. Every 2-3 months we see currencies getting devalued. It’s for sure going to happen and this time it will be Stocks, Real estate/ Mortgage and the new addition will be currencies. The USD will crash fatally- DO
3951 2018-10-11 06:01:19 Yes. Tariffs means inflation, means rate hikes, means treasury yield rises, means stocks sell as priced relative to risk free assets

4008 2018-10-11 05:37:30 Watching the market very closely tomorrow. Bank stocks are on the verge of breaking down. Especially like $GS, Goldman Sachs. It has a H&S forming since this time of last year. Right shoulder did not break out with much volume so I hope to see some tmrw. Need close under 209.
4009 2018-10-11 05:37:24 I would take this opportunity to buy good quality stocks and sit tight
4010 2018-10-11 05:36:17 The raising is half of it. They are also selling 50 billion a month of bonds. (Draining liquidity) @SantiagoAuFund is 110% right but I'm leaning more towards stocks have peaked as too many names/sectors have broken for now
4011 2018-10-11 05:35:22 Dams being built by collecting donations and stocks falling like anything... not sure how will a housing scheme fix things like dollar price? Stocks? Price of gas and petroleum? And going to IMF for biggest loan ever... is there even a plan that exists???
4012 2018-10-11 05:35:09 just a little delayed perhaps.

Look at strong dividend stocks and utilities, they are behaving like gold should now.
4013 2018-10-11 05:34:54 Yes i also made over 2X. I know people who made 5-10X also. But they are just the exception and not the norm. So many corrupt companies with dubious accounting practices have seen stocks plundered 80-90%. They too had thousands of retail shareholders who lost everything.

4040 2018-10-11 05:25:45 Great call ~ this has move has been coming for a while. Market participants forgotten multiples can go down as well as up! Way too many just longs stocks on upgrades and breakout rather than assessing on valuation. Derating time is when you lose your capital fast!
4041 2018-10-11 05:25:07 Set it and forget it! Investing doesn’t always have to be about selling off stocks IMO. It’s about holding for the long-term and having a plan.

4120 2018-10-11 04:56:00 how bout  focus on stocks
4121 2018-10-11 04:55:38 The people who borrow money to buy stocks are selling off because interest rates are going up and the cost of borrowing money is going up.  But since it's actually gambling, they'll start buying again in a few days because stocks are so low.
4122 2018-10-11 04:55:35 bonds and stocks will head back up together

4137 2018-10-11 04:51:09 Folks, it's a rigged system.  I worked in the financial industry for over a decade.  Once I discovered that the Fed had *never* been audited, and that they purchased equities (ie.  owned stocks bought and sold on the NYSE and others), I knew it was all *rigged*....
4138 2018-10-11 04:50:56 Roll with it 2: Crucially #USD is going DOWN, NOT UP Overnight and the #euro trades right at our forecasts. Right in line with peak US growth and our #FX forecasts. This is all about yields/ FX not the long awaited stock movements. #bonds #equities #stocks #portfolio #investing
4139 2018-10-11 04:50:50 Big House story time:

Was playing friendlies on day 2 and this garbage doc main hops on the setup and I proceed to 4 stock him. 

2nd game I'm about to do it again and he rage quits.

3rd game I'm about to be up by 3 stocks so I switch to zelda to make it more interesting (1/2)
4140 2018-10-11 04:50:30 I wouldn’t say exit stocks for cryptos. Would add cryptos as a niche asset class to a diversified portfolio. Vols are too high for any institutional investor to switch.
4141 2018-10-11 04:49:08 Good morning to all Leveraged long stocks holders.
4142 2018-10-11 04:48:51 Large domestic demand for domestic product too. Minimize trade war threats. Localized markets. Cannabis stocks seem better to me more than ever in this economic climate.
4143 2018-10-11 04:48:29 Atleast my stocks were good today
4144 2018-10-11 04:48:16 built cannot be sold for x number of years. In a country where people have gotten insanely rich by speculating and hoarding on lands, cars, food stocks, no subsidy can help the problem of housing. Regularizing katchi abadies can be a solution which will only attract more qabza
4145 2018-10-11 04:48:04 I'm gonna call after lunch break earlier, will let you know! I'll ask when new stocks are expected to come in. I wish they'll take reservations grgrgghh
4146 2018-10-11 04:47:41 You think maybe he sold all the stocks the day before?

4148 2018-10-11 04:47:14 Last few corrections have lasted at max few months .. None has been as long as 1996 - 2003 for old economy stocks and even 2000 -2003 for all stocks .. It will tough for people to see their SIP turning in negative returns for say 3/ 5 years ..

4150 2018-10-11 04:46:35 Stocks are down today because Nikki Haley is stepping down as Ambassador to U.N. and foreign investors  are heartbroken.
4151 2018-10-11 04:46:23 Timely reminder to stay focused on what matters most for our stocks over the long term.
4152 2018-10-11 04:46:16 You may ask why the stocks have fallen--I say, first the stocks, later, the tumbrels.
4153 2018-10-11 04:46:00 It’s a correction apparently 

No, stock markets are going down, they are not correcting. There is no correct price for stocks, there is just the price people are willing to pay and it changes every second of every day
4154 2018-10-11 04:45:41 i just remembered the economist had a fake food truck at daley plaza the other day with like a menu of stocks or some shit. what the fuck was that
4155 2018-10-11 04:45:10 Initially it is fun as you feel you are getting bargains   .. but when stocks / NAV start further falling down for longer time  and all unrealised gains disappear , you see the wealth lost is several time annual income then real panic starts .We have just started
4156 2018-10-11 04:45:01 The $SPY is currently at $275, another $3 drop since the close. #Trading #Stocks #StocksToTrade #StocksToWatch
4157 2018-10-11 04:44:55 54% of American households own stocks, comparing with 7% of Chinese households who are invested in stock market...Now who is winning?
4158 2018-10-11 04:44:34 I don’t get why everyone is shocked at this week’s market selloff. It’s very obvious most stocks are overpriced currently. P/E ratios are insane. Not much is worth investing in.
4159 2018-10-11 04:43:36 I'm getting into FX/Stocks myself so considering starting to counter trade them on that too haha
4160 2018-10-11 04:43:33 Risk for India is that our exchange rate is determined more by capital flows.And rising yields in US bonds will affect both Indian stocks & rupee value as foreign capital moves out.
4161 2018-10-11 04:43:23 when interest rates go up, some people sell stocks and buy long-term bonds because the yields go up, and the sheeple think the dip in the market means the market's "bad" and they panic and dump everything
4162 2018-10-11 04:43:01 54% of American households own stocks, comparing with 7% of Chinese households who are invested in stock market...Now who is winning?
4163 2018-10-11 04:42:51 $SQ went from being one of most overbought stocks to being severely oversold in less than a week. Gonna be an epic recovery in the next couple days!
4164 2018-10-11 04:42:40 10/10 Fund Managers hold HDFC and Reliance for the Valuation. When these stocks go low, Fund managers tend to buy them more. These two stocks have more Institutional buyers than Retail ones.
4165 2018-10-11 04:42:31 Stocks in the news: TCS, Zee Entertainment, PTC India, Dilip Buildcon, ITI, OIL, GE Power, are stocks which are in the news today.

4166 2018-10-11 04:42:10 ALL TECH STOCKS!  THIS IS A PLANNED EVENT BY THE DEMOCRAT TECH GIANTS!!
4167 2018-10-11 04:42:01 Just imagine those who sold good midcap stocks and shifted to HDFCs at 1900 and 2000s, Bajajs at 2800 and 6000s, ITC at 310s, Infy and TCS at 730s and 2209s....
4168 2018-10-11 04:41:18 The selling was triggered by a fall of more than 800 points in the Dow Jones industrial average on Wall Street on Wednesday. It was the worst drop in eight months and was led by sharp declines in technology stocks. In earlier trade in Europe the FTSE100 index lost 1.3% and
4169 2018-10-11 04:40:36 Which could mean we have more sales in rakhi!
Time to invest on matrimony stocks.
4170 2018-10-11 04:40:32 Roll with it! We r in rolling corrections, 1st EM Assets, 2nd Nondollar FX, Now US stocks /tech. Time for tactical trading ie, sectors, value outperforms in rising rates, or Long term asset allocation. Focus on EM bonds, FX in coming months as the dollar peaks. #fx #bonds #stocks
4171 2018-10-11 04:40:25 Yeah ... they weren't  " loco " when the stocks were rising. And since dealing with Mexico, it's his new Mexican word ... that, and bad hombres.
his choice of new "foreign" words to use is very telling.
4172 2018-10-11 04:39:41 #letitrip. Trump hates to be wrong but he is often wrong.  If you recall when the stocks were up, he always takes credit.  The stocks dropped considerably, It was his doing.  He needs to own up and except his part in the stocks dropping.  The Idiot.

4176 2018-10-11 04:38:19 Actually it was only the 3rd biggest loss, the storm, tensions with the saudi's oh and the big tech guy's memos leaking about their bias against Our President leaking made their stocks take a beating. 
 Its a market correction, a drop yes but the overall level is still up
4177 2018-10-11 04:38:18 Online Thursday morning trading the open. Hoping for a very ugly open that washes out all the sellers.  Big down gaps after the carnage of today should give us a good long opportunity. But if stocks open higher, be careful. Don't trust the buyers.
4178 2018-10-11 04:37:57 You cannot justify failure of the current government through closing eyes to stocks in which a lot of people put their money and then u say that they are out of economy. This govt has worsened the situation by creating a " Bad Perception " and " Uncertainty "
4179 2018-10-11 04:37:50 10/9 quarterly reports are issued on stock investments. 10/10 stocks plummet 800 points.  Republicans are scum #VoteThemOut2018 #RESISTANCE #VoteDemocrat2018 For America in crisis and oh yeah #FuckTrump
4180 2018-10-11 04:37:17 Wish we had a president that cared about how the economy, stocks, Businesses & its citizens were doing other than "It's about me, I'm a genius." 5 days of loses on the market are not normal, stock futures down 1% is not normal.
4181 2018-10-11 04:36:36 May be investors need to wait for next 2 years to get out of stocks at cost. Confidence shaken after looking at mayhem. Nifty still needs a rock solud bottom in place. 1 year of bulls hard work vanishes in a month.
4182 2018-10-11 04:36:17 I’m planning on using the green   I’ve made on the green weed stocks to go green on my roof top with a new solar system!
4183 2018-10-11 04:36:09 But what we fail to understand is the sell off in US is for #FAANG stocks which are at crazy valuation. I feel the market will settle down and will not be surprised for a positive close today.

4186 2018-10-11 04:35:29 @porinjuveliyath Sir, dont you smell a conspiracy by some powerful people in constantly hammering stock market? Has ruined lives of mid class people who hv invested their hard earned money in stocks
4187 2018-10-11 04:34:52 Not much a difference. Normally an individual stock sees downside of 3% in a single day. Whereas currently our national index sees downside 3%. @RBI @SEBI_India @NSEIndia @BSEIndia @FinMinIndia #Nifty #India #equity #market #NSE #BSE #SEBI #stocks
4188 2018-10-11 04:34:34 So, we're puzzled.. when the market you keep bragging about and your yokels who own zero stocks pretend to care drops 800 points do you accept the blame, or only the credit for when it goes up?

4221 2018-10-11 04:23:29 @debarlinea Corporate Governance. An individual is unlikely to invest in Kenyan stocks because of reported mismanagement of firms trading in NSE. If you have money, one would rather invest in real estate/tangible assets.

4236 2018-10-11 04:18:05 Wall Street can’t make money when market hit highs. They need a pull back so they can steal our money and start over again. They are selling bonds that cause rates to go up and sell stocks to raise more money and buy those same bonds that pay budget rates. Get it.

4268 2018-10-11 04:06:57 To be honest I'm not too worried about that $BTC drop but if stocks are seriously going to crash I think it's wise to consider the affects on the crypto market.
4269 2018-10-11 04:06:52 He is arguing semantics... FOPA '86 banned "machine guns," or fully automatic firearms.

Today, AR-15s (not considered "Assault" rifles) are still popular, and the DoJ has not yet banned bump stocks designed to make them perform like fully automatic weapons.

4272 2018-10-11 04:05:59 Tech stocks dipoped by about 5% too. This is all a part of a global financial system.
4273 2018-10-11 04:05:49 Twitter feed is just full of market crashing FUD. Little ole me was just staring at pot stocks, didn’t know the world was ending. The fear seems to spread much easier than the optimism.
4274 2018-10-11 04:05:41 The Dow stocks dropped 800 points AND bonds fell. That combination of the two falling together is a once in a lifetime event. If bonds do not rally spectacularly by week's end, dig deep and store grain.

Remittances from overseas Pakistani workers rose 13.14 % in the first quarter of current fiscal year, mainly on the back of strong economic & job market growth in the major contributing countries & devaluation of rupee
4279 2018-10-11 04:03:52 But in all this negativity the silver lining is that good quality stocks will rebound sooner than later as it happened yesterday.....Patience is the key...its time of screening Men from Boys (applicable to both investors and scrips)

4296 2018-10-11 03:59:37 They are paid to promote stocks. That is why they are recommended? Never believe them. Plus, @shuvankr never take short term calls especially the 5, 15 or 1 hour. It's basically NOISE that you are buying and selling into.
4297 2018-10-11 03:59:30 Thought the #stockmarket would hold out until the 2018 tax revenues came in, but seems like another autumn crash is here. Safety stocks are the only green, #Bitcoin and #Ethereum are suffering with the Asian markets, prices always correlate. #stockcrash #crypto #shorttime

4313 2018-10-11 03:55:37 While Nike's revenue isn't growing as rapidly as Netflix, Amazon, its stock has surged recently; the stock's excellent performance in 2018, therefore, has put Nike in the spotlight along with other growth stocks.

4317 2018-10-11 03:54:53 Why metals are down today and why it looks weak ?

4319 2018-10-11 03:54:32 What we need to hear tomorrow to calm the stock market is people who have never been bullish saying this has further to go and stocks are risky.

4323 2018-10-11 03:52:20 $SPY The real clue today was very shortly after the open when good stocks triggered a sell signal, well before the major selloff that was more obvious later. These are things that pros doesn't predict but rather makes decisions based on the evidence as it occurs.

4333 2018-10-11 03:47:45 #bitcoin this is not the time to buy. As the stocks sell off, people move funds around which will drop the price further of the sell off continues.
4334 2018-10-11 03:46:58 Hey plutocrats: The Dow peeled of 800 points yesterday and is set to lose another 350 today. You need to use your #GOPTaxScam windfall to buy more stocks. prop up the market. We can't help you: all of our money is going to food, clothing, shelter, education and health care. Sorry
4335 2018-10-11 03:46:43 The Dow Jones dropped 800 points, every major company and trading sector felt it. It's going to continue tomorrow as well due to the ongoing trade war, Fed rate increase and overall market correction. The McMahons sold massive stocks earlier this year during the bull run.
4336 2018-10-11 03:46:30 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to cure your bipolar disorder
4337 2018-10-11 03:46:10 I think you will get your wish. Then a bounce sometime after 10 and before 2. We are so close to support on so many index's and stocks. The bad part is so many are willing to step in on Thursday. The crowd is seldom correct however the shorts really can't start new positions here

4342 2018-10-11 03:45:00 Once valuations correct by 50% - 60% in US :)

Two theories: a big correction coming worse than 2008 (where markets went down 50%), or the next ten years of nil returns from stocks. Hopefully the latter for those who retire soon and should have been safe.
4343 2018-10-11 03:44:27 Mutual  Funds r mutilate Funds.. I have not seen booking profits even at 11800 even on those level they were buyers..money was not given to buy highly overpriced stocks..

4376 2018-10-11 03:37:18 In the long run ofcourse digital assets should gain more momentum but no one can predict the next 3 months . If there is a severe equity drawdown it is unchartered territory because for the entire life of cryptos stocks have been in a bull market (most assets actually)

4380 2018-10-11 03:35:57 Lessons from recent market well-off -
1. The art of selling is more imp than the art of buying
2. Never fall in love with your stocks
3. Never rely on tips
4. If you have access to quality research or you can do it yourself, it's fine. Otherwise invest in mutual funds
4381 2018-10-11 03:35:54 Yes sell everything , get provisions , the end is near. Head to hills 

Almost all the hit was with tech stocks which were overheated and getting batted around lately.
4382 2018-10-11 03:35:18 Hopefully closes down -888 and sign of good luck will have Chinese buying stocks again.

4384 2018-10-11 03:34:44 I use Schwab to purchase ASX stocks not sure why Fidelity won't do it. Ganfeng down almost 20%, ouch!  Maybe use your $ to buy #LTHM but IMO not a good time for an IPO BWDIK.  Good symbol however.
4385 2018-10-11 03:34:19 If not stocks, can we enlist some specific sectors...
4386 2018-10-11 03:34:01 Trump obviously can’t figure out TRADE as judged by the drop in stocks today. @realDonaldTrump is a LOSER.
4387 2018-10-11 03:33:31 Blame moderate stock market drops on whatever you want, the Fed, trade wars, whatever. But that's not why. When it is high and it goes down some, that's people making money. The people that are selling are cashing out and turning stocks into cash. Pretty simple.

4390 2018-10-11 03:32:59 This is the best part of dollar cost averaging I tell myself as all my other stocks go down
4391 2018-10-11 03:31:42 98% of OTC stocks are pump and dumps. That’s not an exaggeration. I really believe 98/100 are BS
4392 2018-10-11 03:31:19 Next round of selling will be lead by IT majors most probably so if you are holding tech stocks  like infy, tcs, wipro, techm etc. our view is that you should take gains in these, shorting also can be a good idea.

4394 2018-10-11 03:30:28 "The S&P 500 posted its fifth straight decline, plummeting nearly 3.3%. And tech stocks got hit particularly hard. The Nasdaq dropped more than 4% in the worst percentage decline since June 2016"
4395 2018-10-11 03:30:14 During same time frame of Obama first term and Trumps, stocks did WAY better under Obama. Today’s clobbering sets Trump back further.

S&P 500 averaged 16% a year under Obama’s 8 years which is historically phenomenal.
4396 2018-10-11 03:30:09 It's surprising that nobody wants to buy when NSE and BSE has started their own version of Big Billion Days / Great Indian Sale. I guess they forget that offers are valid only until stocks (pun intended) last 
4397 2018-10-11 03:30:00 "The Dow plunged nearly 832 points on Wednesday, the third-worst point decline in history.
All 30 Dow stocks were in the red, sending the index below 26,000 points for the first time in a month. The index fell by more than 3%"
4398 2018-10-11 03:29:55 Only regret today was not buying stocks on my watchlist
4399 2018-10-11 03:29:09 Ok, Matt’s here. Change the subject....                                                      KPIs, stocks , dividends, why it’s all dividends these days...
4400 2018-10-11 03:28:54 Stock of $AMZN , $GOOGL , $AAPL and many more quality stocks were dropping like a fly in last 5 minutes of trading session! looks like, there was no bid! Not sure it was a stop loss order or machine trading!

4403 2018-10-11 03:25:19 Tech stocks took a big hit overnight leading a sell-off in US equities. SPX -3.29%, Nasdaq -4.08%, Dow -3.15%. US became an easy trade for everyone around the world. But... A fall in US markets will turn out to be very good for Indian markets in medium to short term.
4404 2018-10-11 03:24:42 As long as you are making money. Diversification is the key. A nice mix of stocks, bonds, gold, silver, real estate, etc. Also doing LOTS of research, and monitoring the financial and economic news 24/7.
God bless you, and best wishes with your finances.
4405 2018-10-11 03:24:38 FANG stocks could be the cause of the next big meltdown in the USA and consequently the global markets.

4408 2018-10-11 03:22:39 As commented in telegram group,Yday, we had dead cat bounce. To mark reversal, we needed to cross 10550 on Nifty & also spend time,failure on that will keep 9600,9950 open.

4409 2018-10-11 03:22:26 Could just the top 1% cause such a scenario, by moving their money around at the same time based on some shared info? It seems they’re not pulling their money out of riskier stocks and plugging it into safer ones, as lower earners would do. Just wondering...?
4410 2018-10-11 03:22:15 Podcast | Stock picks of the day: ITC among 3 stocks which could return 9-12%

4412 2018-10-11 03:21:47 Ron are you a Tax lawyer incognito? What actual figures have you validated? George Soros is not an  American, not an elected official, and he has more influence over the media, Dem politician, and stocks than our President. Follow money.
4413 2018-10-11 03:21:27 It really doesn’t matter what happens tomorrow. What matters is the earning report. Stocks will be back up if earnings are great. I am shopping for good bargains tomorrow. $AMZN may be on my list.
4414 2018-10-11 03:21:06 Bump stocks are still legal so I have no hope we will get anything like gun reform unless the GOP is annihilated.
4415 2018-10-11 03:19:57 If my post to Building & Home Builders has any weight for others, it may cause a rise on stocks like Home Depot (HD) after hours & tomorrow. Because money managers & traders will speculate that a rush by builders to complete means a momentary spike on buying at HD and the like.
4416 2018-10-11 03:19:36 Yes, This is time to do large SIP but remember you will get more and more opportunities at lower levels (5-10%) so this will not be your last chance to buy, so keep on buying in quality stocks. 

People normally stop buying in corrections which is absolutely wrong idea.
4417 2018-10-11 03:19:31 I love watching certain stocks bounce of there lows and bots trying to tempt traders in but we all know everything is going lower...(they must think we are a bunch of chumps!!)
4418 2018-10-11 03:19:20 US equity plunge Wed being followed by slumping Asian stocks & US futures Thurs.  Watch the #Fed.  #Powell suggested another hike Dec19 which would worsen global rout.   Optimistic economic growth forecasts were always a mirage, expect analysts to rush to lower them 
4419 2018-10-11 03:19:19 To watch tomorrow: are both Stocks and Bonds under downward pressure? It happened today, and bears watching. It would be a strong recession indicator if this continues.
4420 2018-10-11 03:18:39 Market can not escape with downward trend seeing global clues . Stocks on major world markets slid to a three-month low, with the benchmark S&P 500 stock index falling more than 3.0 percent, its biggest one-day fall since February. Major Economic reforms require urgently.
4421 2018-10-11 03:18:31 Stocks tank, crypto tank, new Fed chair and Hurricane Michael coming. We might look back at this day as the beginning of the end or it could be nothing at all. Either way Ozark is great so far lol
4422 2018-10-11 03:18:26 rates will plummet and US pot stocks will sky rocket..that was my dream last night....just saying
4423 2018-10-11 03:17:41 The market is completely spooked right now. It's not just the planets and #Gann. Stocks, bonds, crypto, and now Asia markets are down. The only place to hide is cash. I am happily waiting, but I can't shake this feeling that we just got started.
4424 2018-10-11 03:17:20 I agree all markets are not fully intertwined. My question is more with respect to the idea that "crypto will be a safe haven once stocks tumble". That theory is being tested today to say the least. 

Long game either way re: crypto. Todays events and questions are just banter.
4425 2018-10-11 03:17:09 I have bought a land one year before
 since then never thought of its prices

Currently don't know its actual price

4434 2018-10-11 03:14:08 People will lose less if they buy stocks like MCD. The sellers who are forced to sell will dump even good companies, especially now with ETFs. Better to buy bonds in an environment like this.

4444 2018-10-11 03:10:57 @CdnCouchPotato Hey Dan! Your last guest recommended a 100% stock allocation. Is there an advantage to keeping some bonds other than reducing volatility? When, as an example, rebalancing after stocks take a huge plunge? Thanks so much for what you do btw!
4445 2018-10-11 03:10:27 I’m pretty savvy when it comes to the market so 1 thing I def know is the market will turn around. I just have to wait it out. There are a lot of changes in categorization when it comes to tech stocks. Many of them are being re-categorized as communications. I’ll wait it out
4446 2018-10-11 03:10:11 We're in for a farcical time when politicians, who have been keen to take credit for stocks bring pricey, get busy blaming others when prices slide.
4447 2018-10-11 03:10:08 The SPDR S&P 500 ETF fell 0.57 percent in after hours trading Wednesday, after falling 3.2 percent during a day which saw stocks sell off throughout the afternoon.
4448 2018-10-11 03:09:45 Technically 2/3 of the technology stocks in S&P **are already in correction territory** so it's just a matter of how much harder they're going down. And remember, the volatility & selling only started last Thursday. A week ago Nasdaq was over $8000 and now look at it.
4449 2018-10-11 03:08:52 "Yeah. At this point anyone can join. So here how's you win. There are stages that you fight against the fighters and how to win is you have knock the fighters off the stage. If they have no more stocks you win."

4455 2018-10-11 03:07:26 The US Money channels I was watching were going nuts over the stock market and rejected repeated calls (from viewers) to update the H. Michael situation.

Who gives a toss about one's stocks when the kids are at home in 3' of water and there's no roof?—THEY DO.
4456 2018-10-11 03:06:15 They think it’s better under Democrats then. Forbes reports: U.S. stocks fare far better under Democrats. From March 4, 1929, through July 5, 2016, U.S. stocks returned an average of 1.71% under Republican administrations and 10.83% under Democratic administrations.
4457 2018-10-11 03:05:50 He exclaimed earlier that people were waiting outside all night! So, then he shows up for a 40 min visit? Wonder how many of those folks lost a fortune today. And, it's only started.  There was a total lack of enthusiasm. Secure your stocks now!!!

4511 2018-10-11 02:48:07 The stocks already fell 800+ points today, it's going to crash soon
4512 2018-10-11 02:48:00 Lets sell our future source of a cleaner fossil fuel option to foreigners for pennies on the dollar.  Most of the profit is going to the foreign investors, just like the fact that foreigners own about 1/3 of all U.S. stocks.

Uranium One is just a diversion tactic.

4514 2018-10-11 02:47:15 Getting excited for the dip. If you think long term and do a bit of research this is should be one hell of a time to buy good stocks low.

4517 2018-10-11 02:45:47 Yes we have been hearing about this. Also, the stocks on those SocMed companies have been deep diving today..
4518 2018-10-11 02:45:43 No surprise Holder et al calling for incivility at this time. It’s October+all their rhetoric has been building to this. Now we have a stock market drop, too. Those on left who were quietly buying stocks are now dumping, just in time to look like an economic downturn pre-election
4519 2018-10-11 02:45:34 Can anyone please bat an eye to the relationship between stocks and crypto... Set both at 6hrs and give it a look.
4520 2018-10-11 02:45:32 Just by looking at the stocks today I can tell everyone is having a bad day. I love you all and it will get better.

4522 2018-10-11 02:44:58 Not because of the particular company I believe , but becse of the sliding of the stock market.Once the market regains momentum, the individual stocks will regain..Good time to invest, I will say wait for the final correction..Will slide down more.

4527 2018-10-11 02:42:05 The biggest surprise about the US drop in stocks was that gold didn’t move. I’m still convinced gold will have its time over the next year or so.

4534 2018-10-11 02:39:37 I never said the debt isn' t worse now. You are seriously uninformed if you think Obama was a good negotiator or a great fighter for dem causes. I traded stocks the whole admin and read news feeds all day long. Obama was always sucking up to GOP.

4542 2018-10-11 02:37:15 Stocks fell quite a bit today...didn't hear much on the news. It was stated it was a reaction to the rise in interest rates. I wonder when the impact of tariffs will hit...

4545 2018-10-11 02:37:04 It sure looks like Wall Street made damn sure the crypto currency’s took a hit today so their client base wouldn’t bail from stocks into bitcoin it’s a bit of a conspiracy theory but I think it works
4546 2018-10-11 02:36:52 Markets in Asia took their cue from US stocks, which suffered their sharpest one-day falls in months yesterday. The US Federal Reserve raised rates in Sept 2018 as the economy grows solidly. Higher interest rates makes borrowing more expensive & hurting investor appetite for risk

4583 2018-10-11 02:24:39 Thanks for commenting. I try not to subscribe to conspiracy theories as there is no end to that rabbit hole. Im just confused and fascinated that neither market (stocks nor crypto) appears to be serving as the "safe haven" at the moment.

4595 2018-10-11 02:21:20 The two penny stocks I traded today finished up over 50%. Obviously not a statistically significant sample size, but nonetheless, I agree.
4596 2018-10-11 02:20:43 If investors can get a higher return on investment with less risk from regular investment they'll chose that over the riskiness of stocks, is why. Not sure this level of interest, however, merits such thinking.

4600 2018-10-11 02:19:49 Not sure - I don't follow that strategy as described. Just holding div stocks and some short far OTM puts here and there - it's holding up surprisingly well, so far.

4602 2018-10-11 02:18:45 Now that the US stocks seem to be headed for another bout of  volatility, is it time to trim exposure to Indian equity mutual fund  plans (with significant exposure to the US stocks) such as Parag Parikh  Long Term Equity fund?

    U.S. stocks tumbled the most since February as fresh concern about the impact of the trade war with China roiled technology and industrial shares.

    The yield on 10-year Treasuries held at 3.16 percent after falling five basis points.
4612 2018-10-11 02:16:07 Japan’s Topix index plunged more than 3 percent, set for the biggest  drop since March, with Hong Kong stocks also seen lower. Shares in  Australia and South Korea slid.
4613 2018-10-11 02:15:58 Stocks in Asia tumbled after a rout in U.S. equities that deepened late  in the day amid concerns the trade war is heating up as financial  conditions tighten, dampening the outlook for profits.
4614 2018-10-11 02:15:20 If one compares the massive outperformance of the US stocks versus other geographies since March 2009, if global investors are smart they should increase their allocations to some handpicked EM stocks in my opinion.
4615 2018-10-11 02:15:16 I didn't buy any today though there are some great opportunities out there.  Stocks on sale!
4616 2018-10-11 02:15:15 I’m lucky I have enough savings to replace what I lost. When the stocks are down and you have a managed account, that’s the time to pour money in while things are depressed.
4617 2018-10-11 02:15:04 Why is #bitcoin going down when traditional markets are going down? Here are my theories:
A: Institutional investors want to push the narrative that btc = stocks so they can manipulate prices easier/play into market sentiment
or
B: People are fucking stupid
4618 2018-10-11 02:14:39 Pennsylvania, stocks are plunging, losing all gains made since the summer, presaging a recession in Trump's first term.

4625 2018-10-11 02:13:06 Investors look for delta. Delta for Indian IT stocks is minimal even if  the rupee were to lose another one rupee or so from the current level of  around 74 versus US dollar. As such, yesterday's fall in IT index is as  per expectations.
4626 2018-10-11 02:12:32 At first I was really upset that @joerogan peer pressured Elon into smoking weed (especially when the stocks took a tumble)... but then I realized that this empowered Elon and his transparency to the public.
4627 2018-10-11 02:12:19 The three Asian markets are down with hours to trade yet, so tomorrow will be interesting.

4633 2018-10-11 02:08:30 Mispelled stock for stick, but both stocks finished higher, athe analysts agree nothing to worry, as this is an adjustment to the Tech Sector.And....in my state we have less than 2% unemployment and our gas is $4, but we don’t complain.
4634 2018-10-11 02:06:56 U.S. stocks plunged Wednesday as investors ramped up their selling of high-flying technology and internet stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 831 points, its worst loss in eight months
4635 2018-10-11 02:06:53 @realDonaldTrump hey you take the credit for everything...  The Dow plunged today, fell 800 points and dipped below 26,000. All 30 Dow stocks were in the red.  Worst drop in eight months. GOOD JOB!
4636 2018-10-11 02:06:38 mam all this news you write on stocks every morning  is of no use  ................. stocks are going down daily and stocks like PTC , dilip buildcon , cochin shipyard are down 60%

4638 2018-10-11 02:06:03 Oh God... There's so many good clean energy stocks to buy, there's no point putting those on the list!

Try:
Sunrun, Vivint Solar, Solar Edge, HASI, First Solar, Canadian Solar, Vestas VWDRY
(In that order)

Disclosure: I run a clean energy fund for family.
4639 2018-10-11 02:05:17 Stocks are great because you get paid interest on it
4640 2018-10-11 02:04:49 Not at all, exit in this rally. Best option for u is shift these stocks to Pharma. Stocks like divi, sunpharma
4641 2018-10-11 02:04:28 What about stocks?
4642 2018-10-11 02:04:16 Retweet: From 3PM EST until now Bloomberg has had ZERO fund managers and market analysts on. They have been showing random interviews and clips, NONE of which are market related  is this Good? Or Bad? #Retweet #DowJones #Stocks #StockMarket
4643 2018-10-11 02:03:52 Stock where? That's for mere mortals.
Buhari is in a class of his own. Same way you can fry plantain with PMS, Buhari can't be bothered by things as "insignificant" as stocks and bonds
4644 2018-10-11 02:03:45 Fundamental problem with sector is margins, overhead costs. Buying and selling crude is similar to buying airline stocks
4645 2018-10-11 02:03:01 I started trading when I was 17. 

My specialty was options and pharma stocks.

I retired last year and live on the beach with my wife. 

This is pretty well documented stuff. 
4646 2018-10-11 02:02:34 Y’all boys better go buy some stocks
4647 2018-10-11 02:02:26 get you a man who stocks up on chocolate for your period
4648 2018-10-11 02:01:55 Yeah. It fell all the way back to August! OMG. Ya know, if you had any brains you'd buy stocks tomorrow and ride it out. Unemployment numbers, great. GDP great. Stocks are on sale and this is an opportunity. This was predicted to happen along with a fed rate change...
4649 2018-10-11 02:01:33 Markets doing pre diwali cleanup of the house. All redundant stocks being sold to kabadiwala (retail) at scrap value.. and retail will buy them as they see value only in kabadi. In the end, scrap will be sold as scrap only after some years. 

Think before investing.

4651 2018-10-11 02:01:08 Pretty tough day for stocks and implications for our retirement. Your rally comments were uplifting and lifted the spirits of my wife and I. You are doing so much to improve our economy and thanks for all you do.
4652 2018-10-11 02:01:02 more winning,  less losing $ on stocks
4653 2018-10-11 01:59:54 Not a bad day at all for $SIC.v and $PIVT on a very red day. Both companies did very well today with crews working hard in the fields. A lot of institutional buying on both #stocks
4654 2018-10-11 01:59:48 But then again BigHit is smart because they will debut their new boy group when BTS will start enlisting in the military so their stocks won’t go down
4655 2018-10-11 01:59:30 Rough Day For Crypto And Stocks
4656 2018-10-11 01:59:11 What’s wrong with stocks that are crashing, gas prices going up, food prices going up?
4657 2018-10-11 01:58:53 Yeah I agree need to work on our KPP stocks but don't think you pass up a quality player if we can get him for fair value
4658 2018-10-11 01:56:21 .... until the one time stocks *don’t* bounce.
4659 2018-10-11 01:56:10 Again today 

NTD  = no trade day

Wt to short wen if ms nifty open down 200 point

NO clues

Better will wait for stocks to give clues if get any
4660 2018-10-11 01:55:14 Hey @realDonaldTrump stocks dropped and our American family lost a lot. Get your shit together
4661 2018-10-11 01:54:52 The Dow Jones stocks fell 832 points today.. I took a big hit.. there goes my IRA fund... — feeling pained
4662 2018-10-11 01:54:32 but your grandpa's stocks
4663 2018-10-11 01:53:32 Not a big deal.  It's a mild bull market correction for IT stocks.  It needed to happen.
4664 2018-10-11 01:52:49 Did not invest in stocks → stocks rise 50% .. 
Invested in stocks → stocks tank over 20% ..
4665 2018-10-11 01:51:47 so we just gunna say my stocks went down cause the hurricane and not the bad energy.
4666 2018-10-11 01:51:34 Negative price changes are called volatility, while positive price changes are called profits . #stocks #investing #trading
4667 2018-10-11 01:51:17 And I wouldn’t be surprised if the tech stocks are doing something against us too.  Google, Facebook, etc.... all Left leaning
4668 2018-10-11 01:50:41 You think stocks are going to recover now?
4669 2018-10-11 01:50:36 Don’t even start to look at stocks until you are seeing “markets in turmoil” specials on CNBC.
4670 2018-10-11 01:50:16 Bakit lagi kaming 2nd??? Badtrip na stocks yan bakit kasi bumaba ng bumaba e. Ay competitive lang? Hahahaha
4671 2018-10-11 01:50:11 top ten dividend paying stocks on the #S&P 500
4672 2018-10-11 01:50:08 Yes, though don't forget we had bifurcated market then--excess mostly in tech and a handful of large-cap growth stocks. This time, excesses / overvaluation pervasive--whole market could crash like Nas in Mar 2000. Mild Main Street recession with more severe mkt downturn possible.

4674 2018-10-11 01:49:16 October 11, 2018: As of 9:35 a.m., 6,849.88 down 151.26 points or 2.16 percent. PSEi opened at 6,934.76 #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
4675 2018-10-11 01:49:13 We had been trimming our exposure over the last month or two. There are more stocks on my currently researching list than yesterday. Some solid falls.
4676 2018-10-11 01:49:01 People aren't going to invest heavy in speculative markets when stocks and even gold/silver are going down. If $BTC was farther along it would be different though
4677 2018-10-11 01:48:48 Last thing u want is gap up in morning. Rather c selloff (hopefully not to big) & then recovery #stocks
4678 2018-10-11 01:47:52 Who cares! Dow closes down about 830 points as stocks plummet in biggest one-day sell-off since February. Rising interest rates and ongoing trade conflicts spook investors and "fear is rising." This is because of you. Everyone warned you, and now it’s coming true.
4679 2018-10-11 01:46:54 Bond rates are better than stocks now. People juss moving $
4680 2018-10-11 01:46:24 Investing in stocks has made me immune to buyers remorse. I lose hundreds of dollars in my sleep for no apparent reason.
4681 2018-10-11 01:46:05 newmont mining was one stock that went up today while FANG got destroyed. Nice to know old rules of hedges made from gold mining stocks haven't been up-turned.
4682 2018-10-11 01:45:46 If yall havent put any money towards cannabis stocks yet.. yall better do it now.

4683 2018-10-11 01:45:39 Koi nahi sunega things are looking very similar to global tele hfcl silver line type of fall in may stocks
4684 2018-10-11 01:45:38 So Jim, what about dividend stocks?  Dump them now?
4685 2018-10-11 01:44:45 This interest rate conspiracy takes the cake. How did the Fed manipulate it in order to send stocks on a downward spiral.....just in time for midterms?

4686 2018-10-11 01:44:38 Yes Deepak. I hope our markets will not show so much correction today ,may be will be loosing yesterday rise. I hope stocks will not be so badly hit today apart from nifty and sensex
4687 2018-10-11 01:44:03 RIP my friend who bought tech stocks two months ago because “crypto is too volatile.”

Goodnight sweet prince
4688 2018-10-11 01:44:03 Safe stocks will regain consciousness 
4689 2018-10-11 01:43:50 Last time, it was a nine-month phenomenon. Ended mid-2015. Pattern was that growth stocks (tech, etc.) soars while cyclicals and EM wither.  Saw it in 1999-2000 as well. Ends with everything tanking, especially the over-heated growth stocks.
4690 2018-10-11 01:43:44 I understand your frustration, Moe, but the people who have all these stocks probably don't follow you on social media.
4691 2018-10-11 01:43:06 Oh boy, my Yahoo stocks :(
4692 2018-10-11 01:42:54 Wrote a letter for Trump Jr - then denied - which was a complete lie about the russia meeting in Trump tower.  Yeah, I love America, my family has served. But I can't sell my soul to see my stocks rise
4693 2018-10-11 01:42:15 Taxes are only lower for the rich. And did you noticed the huge drop in stocks today. Not winning at all. My question for you is how would you know what life is like under trump’s corruption if you live in Belgium?

4697 2018-10-11 01:40:07 My theory, they din really produce a lot of inoo’s photos back then so when the demand increase, the stocks are not that many so resale shops have power to raise up the price crazily 
4698 2018-10-11 01:39:43 Rough day today in stocks and crypto. And here many of us we're thinking that they are not intertwined anymore.
4699 2018-10-11 01:39:19 He’s chill... only in weed stocks....look at his eyes
4700 2018-10-11 01:39:19 Buy stocks now in the playdough & coloring book factory,   It will be great for the economy!!!!!
4701 2018-10-11 01:39:04 If he had better brains he would have hammered the tech stocks as overpriced and threaten them with legal action over this and that.
4702 2018-10-11 01:38:05 I have to admit you really don't understand stocks. I don't like trump. But all those drops are not related to policy
4703 2018-10-11 01:37:53 Winding down after a tiring work day, glad $AEP held up well on very down day for stocks, always stay diversified.
4704 2018-10-11 01:37:44 Will be interesting to see how  cryptocurrencies respond to a period of extended decline in #stocks. And when I say various cryptocurrencies, I’m talking about #Tether. $USDT #stablecoins #unstablecoins?
4705 2018-10-11 01:37:41 Stocks down, bitcoin down.

No safe heaven for anyone apparently :/
4706 2018-10-11 01:37:37 I do think we have seen the top though in many stocks for awhile - your FANG stocks . look at a chart these stocks are up 100-200% in last 2 years.

4712 2018-10-11 01:36:24 Safe to say #stocks and #crypto are correlated?
4713 2018-10-11 01:36:17 its is not a melt down yet ? .. over valued stocks have been booked just as we did in Sept ... ! is there a unveiling of some undoing as of now ?
4714 2018-10-11 01:35:51 Since we got Justice K on SCOTUS, the Deep State elite have decided on burn-it-down operation all the way to Midterms.  They know they can’t win fairly.  In the last few days, there was major attack on stocks and a major hurricane.  Both orchestrated with much more coming.
4715 2018-10-11 01:35:41 @realDonaldTrump Thanks president Trump (uncapitalized for effect and because you didn’t earn it) for ruining President Obama’s economic recovery.

4722 2018-10-11 01:32:40 going through my 15 stocks and seeing damage. setting some stop losses (which I should have done last week, but was too busy and irresponsible with my stocks). Kind of surprised how many trades I have entered in the past two months that are still green in this phocked up market
4723 2018-10-11 01:31:50 Stocks & Crypto markets are getting rekt .. wtf?!
4724 2018-10-11 01:31:41 those who took money out of crypto to put in stocks will regret very soon. dont worry
4725 2018-10-11 01:31:09 Market is now being pushed lower by "whales". Some other whales defended 6K on multiple occasions. It's all whales. Stocks are no different. Lock at the stock market today. It didn't tank like that because of retail traders. "Orchestrated" though, that's another story.

4727 2018-10-11 01:30:46 Not sure I understand your point. Investors are leaving the space. If you are referring to my ETF comment, it was intended to be a sarcastic remark to reference large-cap stocks. Sorry for the confusion  @DeseretAlts
4728 2018-10-11 01:30:18 Shark News-@FoxNews-No,One will accept the fact that the “SICK DEMCRATS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE RESPONSIBLE, IN PART, for the 800 point drop. The economy was driving, but investor’s stopped, and “dumped” the stocks that were driving the “market up! But I say “stupid Dems, the cause!
4729 2018-10-11 01:30:17 The majority of stocks are in bear market territory but that’s not the same as a bear market. If investors buy a broad index fund, then they’re not in a bear market. They’re down 5.5%.  If someone is trying to pick stocks and missed the big winners, then its possible.
4730 2018-10-11 01:30:16 All the stocks around the world are dumping down. 

All investments are being gutted. 

I warned everyone that a global market crash will start on

And that’s exactly what’s happening. 

This is going to get worse. There will be riots and blood in the streets.
4731 2018-10-11 01:30:01 we will see but that wasn't the point.  maximalists love bitcoin so much, they tell you to buy stocks and use credit cards.

4732 2018-10-11 01:29:41 Sham for spreading fake news. Why stocks are suddenly plunging????

4748 2018-10-11 01:23:23 The tax cuts created temporary confidence in the market, until stockholders and the top 1/2 percent began repurchasing all of their stocks. Trumps trade wars with the world is bringing the market back to stagnation. Farmers & Ford suffering. The trickle down theory NEVER works.
4749 2018-10-11 01:23:21 Mini Stocks and Superstocks qualified two weeks ago. And there was 35 Mini Stocks for 24 qualifying spots, there will be a last chance race for the last 6 spots.
Superstocks will also have a last chance race to fill the rest of the field.
4750 2018-10-11 01:22:57 I don't buy the argument that stocks can't rally with the 10-yr over 3%, that's just not historically correct. So either this is an overreaction to a narrative (largely possible) or there is something else going on that we don't fully understand yet.
4751 2018-10-11 01:22:27 “Marijuana stocks and some other stuff” I was told. I’ll know for sure shortly.
4752 2018-10-11 01:22:20 When Wall Street feels gloomy, I say to myself, “stocks are on sale!” and buy some bargains.

4755 2018-10-11 01:20:42 Trump put trade tariffs on China. Stocks start going down. Then Trump says today “Fed has gone crazy.” The Fed must be independent. Trump sets up the Fed’s to take blame if market goes lower with interest hike. And Trump will take credit for rise in market if he softens tariffs.
4756 2018-10-11 01:20:23 Sound argument and one that I follow, but it’s worth noting that if you bought stocks in 300 AD it took 1400 years to make your money back

4761 2018-10-11 01:19:18 The stocks tanking today are not connected really to the tariffs afaik. The tariffs are causing other issues and lowering the spending power of the Middle Class and Poor. That will be felt later. Today was tech stocks tanking I believe.

4766 2018-10-11 01:17:32 I think it was a warning sign for stocks like $WWE , $SQ and this micro cap called the $QQQ
4767 2018-10-11 01:17:14 The bubble has begun to leak finally, which I have been expecting since last year. I sold all of my stocks in early 2017. Paid my mortgage off with it. I think it was a good move, especially with the volatility of the market.
4768 2018-10-11 01:17:06 Seriously! WTF? Why isn’t this story huge? What about the big drop in stocks today? Why is this idiot immune???
4769 2018-10-11 01:16:48 A lot of profit taking here... and with rising interest rates there are other less risky strategies than stocks with good returns. 

This is a correction that was badly needed.
4770 2018-10-11 01:16:43 Stocks selling at ridiculous PE prices. Watch your bond market money already  begins to shift. Fed Reserve wants to cool down economy another .50 increase and more. There Globalization policy needs to go away. Market will sneeze. But recovers and 40,000 new goal after election.
4771 2018-10-11 01:16:37 The ‘S’ in “stocks” wasn’t capitalized!! I was talking about the stock market off of Wall Street
4772 2018-10-11 01:16:35 Read my lost premium post: why stocks can’t go up every day
4773 2018-10-11 01:16:09 @jimcramer  Hey Cramer .. what’s the best stock to invest in to see a nice gain .. in 35 years old and just starting to get into stocks and trading #madmoney
4774 2018-10-11 01:16:07 Shoot I need look into stocks... and stop playin’...
4775 2018-10-11 01:15:05 KRAMER: (Uh, no, no, I did, but she appears to ignore) You know, in two months time, everyone! We're back!
(Kramer enters with a big spoonfuls of food stocks.)
SIMON: (starts to Elaine) Just visiting.
JERRY: Oh, here she is again. ...
4776 2018-10-11 01:14:56 A2: We came up with a budget which was considerably less than we spent in the USA. I freelance and my husband trades stocks and we have a small medical device business so those help to cover our expenses. #30seconds
4777 2018-10-11 01:14:52 It's easy to chase yield, but what good is a 4.4% dividend when the stock is down 20% YTD and down almost 8% over the past 5 years? You're young.. if you want yield go for a dividend ETF like $VYM instead and add in some growth stocks.
4778 2018-10-11 01:14:43 Things that makes me procrastinate - travel video & articles, national park news, natural disaster news, technology news...

but I never procrastinate bcause of business/stocks news. Well i even skipped that part when I read the newspaper...is it too late to change my major 
4779 2018-10-11 01:14:10 A few things: Blowing up a Robinhood account, stressing about following stocks everyday, work stress, and finally realizing they are paying me to do everything they were fighting me to do on their own.
4780 2018-10-11 01:13:15 Awesome! Great buying opportunity for stocks and precious metals! Love it!
4781 2018-10-11 01:13:15 I'm asking about semi autos. Not bump stocks. Please learn to read.
4782 2018-10-11 01:13:05 Don’t buy stocks kids
4783 2018-10-11 01:13:01 I’m not anxious, rates low, no inflation, profit taking maybe, but tech stocks anxious..lot of politics.  Carter 70’s rates high, inflation.  Reagan elected - rates went to 21.5% 12-19-80.  New policies under control but ..thinking back was it a reaction by resisters?  Who knows!
4784 2018-10-11 01:13:00 internal ambition: apply to Anthrocon! FUCKING DO IT!
me, a sensible human being with not much money, no car and will have to replenish stocks after this weekend: ....... maybe... maybe 2020
4785 2018-10-11 01:12:58 People better check their 
Superannuation as we all lost a ton of money over night. Some people lost $thousands due to a Wall Street stock market crash over night and its the Australian ASX also with sharp losses across all stocks.

Check you Super !
4786 2018-10-11 01:12:18 Lumber and lumber related stocks taking beatings for days now, so oversold, its just a matter of time until they pop
4787 2018-10-11 01:12:01 I think you have to learn that there's a company behind every stock, and that there's only one real reason why stocks go up. Companies go from doing poorly to doing well or small companies grow to large companies.  -- Peter Lynch
4788 2018-10-11 01:11:51 I question the support area for a lot of stocks... 50% portfolio in VXX and rest in cash until the dust settles (tariffs and Powell)
4789 2018-10-11 01:11:23 Stocks rise and fall. This isn't uncommon.
4790 2018-10-11 01:11:19 And my last comment for tonight... journalists who have been saying stocks down on rising rates will have to come up with something else when stocks keep going down and bonds rally
4791 2018-10-11 01:11:02 $SHAK looks good here closed on trendline and horizontal support. id enter on the close above  57.50. #stocks #StockMarket
4792 2018-10-11 01:10:16 I just want to say to every single one of you that are "waiting for the market to crash" to buy stocks.

That TODAY is the day you were waiting for, these bargains won't last much.

This is just a dip so far!

4793 2018-10-11 01:10:02 Just wondering if the #Liberal CEOs of these Tech companies are deliberately tanking their stocks The @FBI should investigate this PRONTO

4796 2018-10-11 01:08:56 I don't know but some how I have always seen the richbecoming Reicher in crash....
Is the crash deliberately speculative ? 
I have seen returns in stocks like upl which cracked 30 % and returned nearly 4 folds in Nov 2015-jan 17
4797 2018-10-11 01:07:55 Tax cuts are for the one per cent, gas prices continue to rise and the stocks dropped lower than they have in years. You’re the one with no logic. Keep listening to his lies!!You might like paying for golf outings, but I don’t!!
4798 2018-10-11 01:07:55 Dude, I ain't young, but I'm under 40. Stocks going down just means I get cheaper stocks in my passive funds.

I don't know much about the market, but I know cheap stocks are good.
4799 2018-10-11 01:07:49 Today tech stocks suffered their largest one day drop in 7 years and the overall stock market had its worst day since February.  It appears that stocks will drop again on Thursday.  What's going on - and how should YOU prepare for the coming collapse?
4800 2018-10-11 01:07:43 I had started betting against stocks a few weeks ago. So it’s all good for me.
4801 2018-10-11 01:07:25 Red alert for U.S. stocks ! Tech stocks took a big hit overnight leading a sell-off in U.S. equities. SPX -3.29%, Nasdaq -4.08%, Dow -3.15%. Will echo all across. I had highlighted potential for this on Mon. Indian bull interrupted ! #DowJones #markets
4802 2018-10-11 01:07:03 "stocks aren't real," i assure myself as i close my eyes and destroy the economy with my shitty policies
4803 2018-10-11 01:06:53 The stocks plunge, all asset down. If #litecoin can’t withstand this pressure then it’s going down with others. No matter what you wish.
4804 2018-10-11 01:06:21 STOCKS BIGGEST DROP EVER TODAY THANKS TRUMP YOU JACKA....25,598.74 −831.83 (3.15%)

4805 2018-10-11 01:06:16 All my stocks down. All my gas prices up.
4806 2018-10-11 01:05:56 Dow Drops 800 Points! Tech Stocks Big Losses! It’s GAME OVER If Fed Increases Rates!
4807 2018-10-11 01:05:28 Way bad idea, giving tech co's to the government.  Way better idea: giving tech companies to us.  Everybody who contributes to the effort get's a share of tech assets or stocks comparable to how much they spent helping take it.  To the victor goes the spoils.  34th amendment.
4808 2018-10-11 01:05:28 An wonderful team Swiss Alps Energy is a blend of extremely gifted specialists in the market. I'm sure that they will succed in the market. #SAMTokens #Swissalpsmining #bitcoin #blockchain #stocks
4809 2018-10-11 01:05:23 Things may change that , world stocks are plummeting. Aussie down 2 % already though it generally rallies just before close
4810 2018-10-11 01:05:20 Taiwan stocks smoked at the open, down 4.8 percent, worst performing benchmark in Asia after NASDAQ-led Wall Street rout
4811 2018-10-11 01:04:33 Stocks for the long haul is good and I support it, but the price you pay MATTERS.
4812 2018-10-11 01:04:22 But stocks are ‘legitimate’ and crypto is a scam
4813 2018-10-11 01:04:21 Stocks post the third worst point drop in history, the strongest hurricane ever to hit the Florida panhandle is currently happening, and @realDonaldTrump is at a campaign rally. 

When are people going to realize he simply doesn’t give a shit about them?
4814 2018-10-11 01:04:12 Shush, we day traders count on that not being the case, in that greed causes cyclical oscillations.  

Also, I should learn more about how to make money when stocks go down (options and puts and whatnot)
4815 2018-10-11 01:03:11 Thank you for attending “CUNA Mutual’s Beneficiary Designation System” at #ACORDConnect today. Sue Heupel, FLMI, ACE, PSM I and I had a great audience. Special thank you to Karen Motley, Yolanda Austin, and Gary Parent. Also could not have done this without Christine Stocks.
4816 2018-10-11 01:02:06 Stocks plunged by 3.3. Gulp  stocks @realDonaldTrump not necklines.
4817 2018-10-11 01:01:37 No IL& FS is a different story. LIC, mutual funds, PPF are mostly buy the stocks at the peak after 2016

Oct 10, 5:07 PM EDT · WELL YOU WON'T HAVE MONEY TO BET IF YOU HAVE MONEY IN STOCKS TRUMP KEEPS SAYING HE'S BRINGING THE STOCKS UP WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TODAY WAS THE BIGGEST POINT CRASH EVER IN HISTORY 831 POINT DROP OMG
4819 2018-10-11 01:00:50 It already happened. This last run up was a bull trap for the retail investors to buy up the stocks being dumped by the hedge funds. Any coincidence that the top of a 10 year bull market is happening at the same time as a crypto bear market is finding a bottom?
4820 2018-10-11 01:00:46 Be ready!!!! Kpadsssss ba hanap mo! Mag payment ka muna...hehe Para mas marami tayo makuhang stocks. 
Yes po, Mauunang mabigyan ang mga bayad na!

4821 2018-10-11 01:00:44 Invested in 4 stocks today. Feels great to think ahead of what I can visually see
4822 2018-10-11 01:00:38 These stocks from my WL have undercut their recent base bottoms - resetting the base count, if and when they form new bases:  $CSX $WEX $CARG $MEDP $CARB $NUS $EPAM. If market correction continues some more will reset base count. - Good for eventual market uptrend.
4823 2018-10-11 01:00:31 Love hearing people talk about their stocks and investing like they are just gambling in the most boring way possible
4824 2018-10-11 00:59:47 Stocks plummeting.
4825 2018-10-11 00:58:46 Doing laundry , cooking dinner & looking over stocks. A good night.
4826 2018-10-11 00:58:39 That is due to an overzealous fed and tech stocks. Good try. God bless and long live President Trump. Let's continue to #MAGA even for ungrateful naysayers who hate #POTUS for no logical reason 
4827 2018-10-11 00:58:31 "Wednesday’s stock selloff was exacerbated after the high-flying stocks that have propped indices up all year long reversed course.”
-- 3% drop in US stocks on this stormy day
4828 2018-10-11 00:58:25 Stocks are on sale.  Now is the time to buy.
4829 2018-10-11 00:57:53 Stocks have all taken a massive nosedive today too. I wonder if this is a harbinger.
4830 2018-10-11 00:57:46 stocks are highly manipulated. sometimes they don budge on news right away. until the market makers are ready. would have loved to pick up put options on #NKE 2 weeks ago

4833 2018-10-11 00:56:48 What worries me is all SHUT stocks are looking good while Growth names are being sold hard.
4834 2018-10-11 00:56:32 Wrong, it dropped 400 points and still has not recovered that much. When you get up that high in stocks and bonds, and ended slightly down. That is what you call a bowl market. That’s what happened in the 1930s and that’s what happened during the housing bubble. HISTORY!
4835 2018-10-11 00:56:28 People on my feed who last week were talking the market up and complaining about naysayers, today are putting tweets up that state What It Would Take To Get Bullish U.S. Stocks Again.  I obviously missed the big shift in their thinking.
4836 2018-10-11 00:55:46 Dow slipped 830 points in worst rout for US stocks since Feb

4837 2018-10-11 00:55:04 Brand new stocks rarely move with the sector. I think it’s still finding it’s own range.
4838 2018-10-11 00:53:39 Trump blames Fed as Stocks Tumble
Trump controls others by blaming them & making them feel that they are bad. 
He always refuses to admit that he's responsible He can't admit failures or his mistakes so he blames others for them in order to escape his responsibility.

HE'S DESTROYING THIS COUNTRY.
4840 2018-10-11 00:51:21 So if people moved money from stocks to bonds, there’s no real loss except if you’re a company looking at a loss of capitalization. The money is still there. 

The president is still a stupid person.
4841 2018-10-11 00:51:06 It Is Time For All Republicans To Sell What Ever Stocks They Are Holding In Google,Facebook,Twitter Sre Any Other High Tech Companies That Take Political Sides instead Of Being Neutral Of Their Political Opinions This Is The Only Way We Can Fight This Fight
4842 2018-10-11 00:51:01 @realDonaldTrump you should not blame fed! you should blame yourself for the stupid trade war (induced inflation)! even though index is still high but most stocks are in correction.
4843 2018-10-11 00:50:19 Tech stocks will go down?
4844 2018-10-11 00:50:15 Better put your $ into safe stocks everyone. It's coming.
4845 2018-10-11 00:49:36 @AmazonHelp Please provide concrete information about the availability of Oneplus 6 (64GB variant) stocks. Will it be back or not?
4846 2018-10-11 00:49:12 Did you see today’s tech stocks?  Facebook, Twitter???
I see more and more$$$$ influence.
4847 2018-10-11 00:48:58 Trump aside, I'm actually fine with tech stocks going down. They've been horrible on privacy and deserve it.
4848 2018-10-11 00:48:37 Biggest investor's of this country in denial mode so also mutual funds investing other people's money,so also fii s  have large pockets giving buy calls in stocks when on charts prediction of 50 to 75  percent correction can be seen.
4849 2018-10-11 00:48:06 Big drops today #stocks we'll see if they push through the 20 moving average or bounce back.
4850 2018-10-11 00:47:54 So far, mostly already overvalued abstract "glamour" stocks, Apple, Amazon, Facebook etc?
4851 2018-10-11 00:47:51 Stocks peak on great news and bottom on bad world is ending news!  I guess after 10 years, all the geniuses forgot
4852 2018-10-11 00:47:34 My professor told us he lost his annual salary in the stocks today...then laughed...

I’m so tired of being poor.
4853 2018-10-11 00:46:48 A lot of reasons - some self-interested, most not. So many call MJ stocks "under-valued" on the basis of bullshit reasons. Others call a sector "bubble" on similarly bullshitty reasons. Honestly just tired of bullshit. This is what most of it boils down to, IMO.
4854 2018-10-11 00:46:41 I wonder how many guests were on CNBC over the last month saying don’t chase stocks, be defensive, stay in cash, etc.
4855 2018-10-11 00:46:15 DOW closes at the lows, down over 800 points. Tech sector saw heavy selling in the FANG stocks. More declines coming tomorrow??
4856 2018-10-11 00:46:10 People have to learn the hard way that stocks and bonds can be correlated to the downside ... even though you more or less warned them!  Enjoy the air-time, and thanks for enlightening the masses
4857 2018-10-11 00:46:02 Jeff, he's a cynic, don't you get it. A brooding, tortured soul who sells stocks by day & hates himself for it by night, but blames everyone else for his unhappiness. Vote, don't vote.Your gen will suffer. I've spent a lifetime trying to talk sense into jackasses like you. #Done
4858 2018-10-11 00:45:20 Should I sell my stocks?

4860 2018-10-11 00:45:11 Felix, I've been hearing prophecies of all kinds since 2016, yet all I perceive is rise & more rise in good indicators & bad statistics going down. The market & the economy are very cyclical & bad things happen anyways. For now, everything is good. Good luck with your stocks.
4861 2018-10-11 00:44:56 so its true! the military has been talking about the red october plot! its just so happens sa stocks pala may coup

4863 2018-10-11 00:43:49 I’ve always been more leveraged with calls than actual stocks, so this stop has been extremely brutal for me. I’m holding my long term (Jan 20) calls and would add to those but my short term are ruined. 

I have no idea what to expect. It’s in free fall. I could see this go to 90
4864 2018-10-11 00:42:52 Slot machines. So get long casino stocks?? 
4865 2018-10-11 00:42:45 The DOW is just a collection of 30 stocks. The DJI is this weighted thing where they sum the price of these 30 stocks and then divide it by a number (the Dow Divisor) that changes over time to help stability. This artificial sum over a floating divisor went down by $831 today.
4866 2018-10-11 00:41:33 Remember that time that I bought stocks to be an adult and then today happened? Adulting sucks
4867 2018-10-11 00:41:29 We have been talking about how thin the #stockmarket has been on @bullbearradio recently. Through today, 190 #stocks in the S&P 500 are now in #correction territory and 142 stocks are down 20 percent from their 52 week highs putting them in a #bearmarket. $spx
4868 2018-10-11 00:41:23 Would love to know which stocks you own that went up on a day the market dropped 3%. That would be an excellent pick.
4869 2018-10-11 00:41:19 The #StockMarket selloff reminded of the sharp correction we witnessed in February earlier this year, when market sentiment suddenly shifted bearish and stocks tumbled as if there was no tomorrow. #ASX
4870 2018-10-11 00:41:19 It is time to sell tech stocks and find value. With this economy there are plenty of companies that are below value. Do research - be smart and go find value

4874 2018-10-11 00:40:46 We broke a 30yr downtrend last Wednesday in the 30 yr Treasury.  30 years.  Nobody really knows what that means yet, but the market so far is telling us it’s significant and it’s not good for stocks.

4884 2018-10-11 00:35:35 Valuations on equities right now are very fair right now though. Earnings have more than justified the increase in price of most stocks. Yes there are some way overvalued and we have that in Canada too. The FED is trying to sabotage in my opinion.

4889 2018-10-11 00:33:59 The rapidity w/ which the entire growth sector sold off is something not witnessed in years. Normally, there is a period in which the institutional must-owns hold up. Whether that augurs for "just" an 8%-12% correction or something more serious remains to be seen #stocks
4890 2018-10-11 00:33:57 I own stocks in this and it is incredibly frustrating.
4891 2018-10-11 00:33:20 Just with Cannabis stocks moving and the revs of this company and very small float, I would think it would be higher than here
4892 2018-10-11 00:32:54 Trump wasn't supposed to discuss the Fed raising rates. Presidents aren't supposed to, could cause instability, dropping stocks, inflated prices on consumer goods. Trump's a dummy though.
4893 2018-10-11 00:32:48 Idk these cannabis stocks takin a hit this week. I still like ACBFF but idk bout anything else
4894 2018-10-11 00:32:09 The day where Bitcoin is more stable than tech stocks
4895 2018-10-11 00:31:25 Chinese stocks been getting massacred. And is looking like it will continue for a little while longer. Currently shorting $BABA and $BIDU
4896 2018-10-11 00:30:57 Debate: Bredsen says he agrees with President Trump that bump stocks should be banned
4897 2018-10-11 00:30:45 @MarshaBlackburn you STILL did NOT ANSWER the question about Bump Stocks!  All you did was attack Democrats, you didn't answer the question!  Are you afraid to answer the question?
COWARD!!!
#TNSenateDebate
4898 2018-10-11 00:30:42 @FoxBusiness People should not place their lives at stake on stocks alone. People should find other means of continuing a good life. Companies will protect their interests. If you can still work, then keep working. Only the wealthy thinks of retirement.
4899 2018-10-11 00:30:37 On guns, Bredesen says he supports banning bump stocks, but the “cat is out of the bag” on assault weapons and banning them seems impractical.
4900 2018-10-11 00:30:35  Found these #stocks that marked all-time highs: $EACQ
4901 2018-10-11 00:30:10 Neither candidates have voiced opinions of banning assault-style weapons but support the banning of bump stocks. What are your thoughts on assault-weapons?bump stocks? Let us know #TNSenateDebate

4903 2018-10-11 00:29:30 #TNSenateDebate: @PhilBredesen says he thinks bump stocks should be banned. He says he supports citizens' rights to own weapons.
4904 2018-10-11 00:29:20 Stocks just dropped 840 pts today - is that booming? #ThanksTrump #ThanksRafael #BetoForSenate
4905 2018-10-11 00:29:11 .@VoteMarsha: Phil would be right there with the Washington Democrats. He was with Michael Bloomberg last night (in NYC). @PhilBredesen: the bump stocks absolutely must be banned. #TNSenateDebate
4906 2018-10-11 00:29:10 Bredesen: "I absolutely believe bump stocks ought to be banned"

4908 2018-10-11 00:28:46 Well past time for a market correction and historically capital flows are preceded by changes in interest rates, so why such a panic? Near 0% CD rates pushed investors into stocks, and now with improved economy rates increase.
4909 2018-10-11 00:28:04 couldn't agree more - there is no TA in crypto market right now, so please everyone stop trying to act like it works. You may be right one day, but then you will not post for weeks after your predictions...TA does not work in crypto market like stocks...#HODL #believe
4910 2018-10-11 00:27:46 The thumb print’s a match! The other four fingers show subtle differences but the thumb! I knew it. Our stocks’ll skyrocket. What’s that? Oh, surely that’s not the case. No. Our program is unhackable; our software perfection! It could be imitated or a fake, but not on us. #Vss365
4911 2018-10-11 00:27:39 Stocks drop ~6% today; No tweet from Trump to claim credit.
4912 2018-10-11 00:27:13 One might consider taking something in the healthcare sector, far and away the leading broad sector. But when they raid the brothel, they usually get everyone, including the piano player. #stocks

4921 2018-10-11 00:22:01 True.... And why did #Netflix taking the biggest hit out of all #FANG #Stocks  ?  Too many weak hands buying Netflix ... overvalued ? 

#Netflix is global & at the peak of its user reach .... strange that people lose faith in Netflix potential... 

or is it part of political hit

4923 2018-10-11 00:21:13 Stocks.
4924 2018-10-11 00:21:03 J Powell the new scape goat. Rate hikes=DXY climb, less lending(housing/auto hurt) & earnings pain. Powell blamed buys Trump time with China. Trump will play the hero when he strikes a ‘deal’. IMO Tech stock short. Value stocks Buy the dip(s). Long USD. #USD #DXY #XLK

4927 2018-10-11 00:20:18 While the S&P 500 declined 37.6% in 2008, Dollar Tree ($DLTR) (+64%) was among a few stocks that thrived in the recession environment as more consumers looked into buying cheaper products. Today despite DOW’s free fall, Dollar Tree was among few stocks that had a positive change.

4931 2018-10-11 00:18:10 Okay, easy.  So now i’ve spent that 20trill on the above and also ive bought up a bunch of stocks in food producers and farm land equipment etc.  and also bought a bunch of apartment/condo multi resident buildings

4934 2018-10-11 00:16:18 Come on , he is the 25th largest landowner in America and has 5 large estates for him and his family and this did not decimate his worth or stocks. He seems to find the money to gobble up anything he finds worthwhile to spend it on
4935 2018-10-11 00:16:15 CKJ - the big money sees stocks at all time highs (no room to grow), bond rates rising (bond prices dumping) and crypto at super discount priced lows... which one you going to buy :-) Which one has the most upside potential now? Theys movin' to crypto - probably orchestrated it!

4939 2018-10-11 00:15:28 Hoping for 2000 points more on the downside.. Doubt I'll get it. Sod 2/3 of my stocks this morning. Needs to go much lower.
4940 2018-10-11 00:15:13 Awful day! Stay away from growth stocks and go for boring blue chips like Starbucks and McDonalds or Johnson and Johnson
4941 2018-10-11 00:15:07 The average person is better off with low fee index funds tracking domestic and international stocks and bonds. Don't buy specific companies.

4945 2018-10-11 00:14:40 1. Its no wonder that stocks are down, when the @federalreserve are planning on several interest rate hikes over the forseable future. They are trying to tighten up the money supply after years of money pumping QE. Bubbles will burst. REAL ASSETS are over INFLATED paired to USD
4946 2018-10-11 00:14:28 Do you have any favorite marijuana stocks at the moment?
4947 2018-10-11 00:14:23 for the second time stocks down btc up
4948 2018-10-11 00:14:19 It's the typical cycle of the market.  No fretting unless you planned on retiring tomorrow with only a few stocks.
Take advantage NOW and buy those cheap stocks.  I just sent @M1_Finance another order tonight to take advantage of the low prices.

4950 2018-10-11 00:13:44 or when you are a bagholder. Glad I sold 60% of my stocks today. Hoping to revisit the big drop early this year to buy.. not before!
4951 2018-10-11 00:13:22 I've liked $UNP for a long time. It's one of the better run railroads and is usually a somewhat safe buy. $CSX is one I've had my eye on but right now it's moved up a little too much too soon and it might have a correction soon. Other RR stocks don't look exciting right now.

Like that?
4954 2018-10-11 00:12:00 Of course it is time to tweet that as of last week I was 100% cash! Lol Not. Don't believe everything you read! Haha I only hold a few stocks and they are quality and have a few things in the works so not too worried at all. Specs with good broker data are holding up well!
4955 2018-10-11 00:11:49 Middle class people should simplify their approach to investing. Focus on your career, not your investments. Your earning power is your best investment. Spend your weekend time with your family, not trying to pick hot stocks, etc. Buy some good mutual funds or ETFs.
4956 2018-10-11 00:11:41 Expect you to have a virtually complete handle on the markets and letting the Fed. dictate this mess is careless, markets have been weak and vast majority of stocks pathetic since mid.-Jan. IRAs have been equally so, wake up because this is what a strong economy should benefit!
4957 2018-10-11 00:11:33 Drop in tech stocks

4961 2018-10-11 00:09:48 Since products run out of stock quickly, we'd recommend that you place the order as soon as you add it to your cart. That said, you can complete purchases and avail offers until an offer lasts or the stocks remain with the seller. -Aaditya
4962 2018-10-11 00:09:18 Seriously, I don't invest in THC (ethical reasons) penny stocks, but I do in CBD stocks. Your money your risk, but if a person catches the right penny stock before the laws change there is some money to be made. My 1k went to 4k and the laws haven't changed yet. Consider it.
4963 2018-10-11 00:08:55 I get that, I just think it's dumb that people care about it so much; I'll gladly take getting wobbled and still having 3 stocks to figure out how to win the game than losing an interaction that snowballs the whole game into a loss which is what happens in a lot of games
4964 2018-10-11 00:07:45 Stocks have dropped for a variety of reasons, not just due to giving employees a wage they can afford food/housing on. Unfortunately a good number of employees are making less with the “pay raise”. Taxpayers subsidize unlivable wages with food stamps, etc
4965 2018-10-11 00:07:35 There a heaps and heaps of tradable stocks today just gotta be quick
4966 2018-10-11 00:07:34 I’m a long hold, I get nothing from dumping stocks that I feel are a solid investment. I just continue to squirrel away for my rainy day fund.
4967 2018-10-11 00:07:13 follow the money, oil, oligarchs, stocks, voting machine companies, banks and law firms!
4968 2018-10-11 00:06:19 I know more about stocks than the average person. In my 20s and 30s I had most of my money in 2-5 year corporate bonds.
4969 2018-10-11 00:06:16 Nailed it, couldn't possibly be over inflated stocks...
4970 2018-10-11 00:06:14 3) So now the pension plans have no fear of failure. They can invest in, oh, cattle futures. Who cares if they lose money. Why because “we” the taxpayer are on the hook. Really true. Now we all know that pensions need a 60/40 asset allocation bond stocks.
4971 2018-10-11 00:06:04 Jealous of the US stocks right now..
4972 2018-10-11 00:05:50 So I started investing in stocks, I own two lmao it's kinda fun to see how much $10 fluctuates during the day.
4973 2018-10-11 00:05:46 Of you're good at it anyway
Don't burn your entire life savings on stocks
4974 2018-10-11 00:05:29 The Dow industrials extended their steepest October retreat since the financial crisis Wednesday, posting an 832-point decline that raises fresh concern about the health of the nine-year-old bull market for stocks.
4975 2018-10-11 00:05:26 Does anybody use that stash stocks app!??
4976 2018-10-11 00:05:24 OKAY BIG HURRICANE DESTROYING THREE DIFFERENT STATES MAYBE FOUR AND TRUMP IS AT A RALLY IN PA AND KNOCKING ON THE ME-TOO MOVEMENT ALL ON A DAY WITH STOCKS WORSE THAN EVER IN HISTORY. THE DAMN MAN IS A DISRESPECTFUL HEARTLESS CLOWN. WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH HIM.
4977 2018-10-11 00:05:11 Asian stocks falling after today’s sell-off.
4978 2018-10-11 00:04:50 Well I could bring up the economy,jobs,stocks,North Korea, Jerusalem,Isis,Tax cuts and a few dozen more but I don't think logic will change your mind.
4979 2018-10-11 00:04:39 overbought tech stocks + jump in interest rates = moderate correction. no biggie. Actually at 3% not even a correction. Nice try deep state and msm
4980 2018-10-11 00:04:38 I just purchased some stocks this evening to catch the lows!  My teenage son is mad that he doesn't have enough money to invest more in his stocks.  I'm just seeing rainbows and unicorns right now!
4981 2018-10-11 00:04:30 Go  looking I hope its blue rhino help my stocks
4982 2018-10-11 00:04:22 Really depends on what the US does with those assets. If we are talking merely stocks and ownership of going concerns then inf is in stocks.
4983 2018-10-11 00:04:03 A field guide to pumping stocks:
1. Buy shares
2. Start a "blog" that ignores all disasterous -ve facts of the company, write/make up only +ve stuff
3. Blame short sellers, media, SEC etc for the failures
4. Share referral codes 
Well that didnt take too long $TSLA $TSLAQ
4984 2018-10-11 00:04:03 Wow, the sell-off on the tech/growth stocks is pretty brutal right about now. A2M -5.6%, ALU -7.4%, APX -7.7%.

4986 2018-10-11 00:03:33 Many professionals own lots and lots of stocks. Do you own any real estate? Do you own any bonds? Do you own gold? At least once in your life, stocks are going to get killed. You'd better own something else as well.
4987 2018-10-11 00:02:53 Let's see, Stock Market went up 9,000 points in 2 years- we get a pull back of 800 points--meaning still up 8,200 points and a Liberal dummy says that means my 401k is doing bad. Wrong again Liberal. Stocks don't go up everyday forever. Healthy corrections r buying opportunities

4995 2018-10-11 00:00:06 The majority of Americans do not support Trump but the majority of Americans will suffer from a recession, yes! 
This bubble has been growing for a long time. It's good for the wealthy when stocks fall, for buy backs. This is the time to buy, when they crash. You sell when high.
