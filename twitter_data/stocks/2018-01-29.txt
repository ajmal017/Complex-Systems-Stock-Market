64 2018-01-29 23:28:44 European stocks were mixed on Monday, with losses for banks and commodity companies outweighing gains for chip makers.
65 2018-01-29 23:27:44 Jim Cramer of CNBC says this week we will see the bull market run out of gas even though the earnings are super the winners will still lose. If a stocks earning exceed expectations and the stock does not run up - this whole market is just a Ponzi scheme...

67 2018-01-29 23:25:52 What's the difference with ForEx, commodities and stocks?
68 2018-01-29 23:24:52 I believe it depends on the timeframe we are looking at. As the economic cycle hasn’t peaked (apparently) bonds may be suffering yield rises due to short term fiscal exposure. Over a stretch (medium) when stocks correct they will work as safe haven assets.

71 2018-01-29 23:17:34 Why don't we ever have doubles crew battles?

Example:
Team A wins vs. Team D with one stock each. Team E goes in to take out the two stocks, but lose one. Team B goes in vs. 7 stocks.

If a team wins with one character and stock, they can have their teammate back with one stock.

115 2018-01-29 22:37:35 Every investment strategy for folks with money, whether it's in real estate, stocks/bonds/mutual funds, whatever, is designed to keep wealth with the wealthy, who are disproportionately white.

137 2018-01-29 22:28:08 One of my rules is don't buy stocks in a downtrend. Damnit I just broke it again lol
138 2018-01-29 22:27:33 alright, them being Canada pot stocks has nothing to do with just mentioning Canada exchange ticker, you have more followers than just Canadians! we cant buy those tickers!  your not doing the Companies justice if on mult exchanges, jmo, and yes they are still #CanadaPotStocks
139 2018-01-29 22:26:55 Fuck stocks still good though
140 2018-01-29 22:26:33 Yeah - buying stocks on borrowed money is something to brag about
141 2018-01-29 22:25:20 Now that you actually have something to read, you may do your research. Stocks still climbing  Have a good night.

147 2018-01-29 22:23:32 No wonder a .5% pull back in stocks on any given day over the past couple years has produced an "end of the world" reaction from the the ESF. They ought to change its name from "Exchange Stabilization Fund" to "Insolvency Avoidance Fund".

151 2018-01-29 22:21:52 Then why did stocks fall today with things going so good. I’m confused why they fell today? Still in territory, but curious still.
152 2018-01-29 22:21:42 THE SLAP WHEN U WENT BACK HAHAAHHAHA

154 2018-01-29 22:20:20 You're seeing now is termed economic speculation. Employers are hiring and expanding because they see economic opportunity coming up. The economy has improved yet but will . Stocks rose significantly when Trump was elected and again when he implemented tax cuts. Not a coincidence
155 2018-01-29 22:20:16 One major financier stated that there's fear that the economy could  possibly crash. If stocks climb too high & global economy doesn't match up, & Americans take out too many loans (which some of them are starting to do again) there could be a repeat of 2008 crash. Perhaps worse.
156 2018-01-29 22:20:02 I feel more comfortable with Sdrl in the teens but Sdrl can definitely hear up fast as we know
157 2018-01-29 22:18:43 Arsenal football club  goes out of its way to make its supporters laughing stocks, we’re going to sell a player to another rival, this is now the second time they’re  doing this in a week
158 2018-01-29 22:17:15 Then we must impeach @realDonaldTrump #ASAP, or let the stocks indexes talk for us instead.
159 2018-01-29 22:16:37 What does an economic planning session sound like? "Well, if we sell those stocks, it will take some money out that area 4a while; which will crash that company; & we blame a rumor of market correction we made as reason for the buy & sell frenzy robbery paper chase manipulation"

165 2018-01-29 22:12:08 Hmm, I have considered stocks a few times but as for a Roth IRA I already have something for saving for my retirement through my work.

Good ideas though, thanks.
166 2018-01-29 22:11:25 When did Trump have the right to determine who lived and died instead of enacting more strict gun control laws to keep Bump Stocks out of the hands of David Koresh type people?
167 2018-01-29 22:10:52 stocks not that great today

169 2018-01-29 22:09:00 No, in many stocks IV has been in the gutter.
170 2018-01-29 22:08:12 Puseram-me logo a fazer Gestão de Stocks que é o que gosto e percebo menos, a arrumar medicamentos nas gavetas sem eu saber quais as certas e amanhã continuo e ainda estive ao balcão a ver como fazem, não chego viva até sábado.
171 2018-01-29 22:07:23 Ugh, so stupid. Currency only needs to be stable over the time horizon which the holder of said currency expects to need to hold on to it, to purchase more things. Stores of wealth do NOT need to be currency! That's why Soros holds stocks, land, etc.
172 2018-01-29 22:06:16 And then of course there are the massive ethical concerns accompanied by organisms like Roundup Ready props, where corporate conglomerates control seed stocks.
173 2018-01-29 22:05:55 Too bad the MLB shop never stocks those hats!
174 2018-01-29 22:05:45 because Millennials still have the entire weight of the economic rigging against them, and still will at 50, 60 and 70. Until and unless the entire system changes pretty radically. Housing and stocks won't keep on a parabolic curve forever, and we're already locked out.

193 2018-01-29 22:05:05 I've got a few high yield stocks on my watchlist, but just watching. #SSE is on something like 1.2 for 2018. Banks and insurers have lower yields, but better cover.

195 2018-01-29 22:04:42 U.S stocks slide as investors looking ahead to the Fed’s two-day monetary policy meeting
196 2018-01-29 22:03:56 when stocks fall at the same time that bonds fall, what are they rotating into?
197 2018-01-29 22:03:38 Economy is up, Unemployment down, Record stocks, Better foreign affairs, Better trade deals, Etc. And it’s only getting better. What bad is he doing?
198 2018-01-29 22:03:37 People care so much about money, why are they not trying to get more or save more? Do your research. Find out your needs/wants. Prioritize your bills. Prioritize your lifestyle. Invest in stocks or people's businesses. Make your money work for you, not the other way around.
199 2018-01-29 22:02:50 Definitely. That's why I mention the dividend cover. Historically they're lower on FTSE stocks than in the financial crisis.

Only how stocks are up HE and HIS FRIENDS are Getting Richer

205 2018-01-29 22:01:22 Then get busy and pass legislation to

“Unacceptable” is weak rhetoric when the country needs action 
Thanks for drafting legislation to prohibit bump stocks, tho’.
206 2018-01-29 22:00:57 Vou acabar com os stocks de lenços dos supermercados todos
207 2018-01-29 22:00:50 Doesn't a stock market up 40% since he took office equate to large 401k gains among working Americans who had their retirement money in stocks? I don't argue the rich aren't making out like bandit lords, though.
208 2018-01-29 22:00:38 #Stocks,#Indexes And of course, this suggests a BOTTOM signal potentially in the offing, repetition a predominant market modus operandi.

212 2018-01-29 21:58:55 Zero. Not many.. some in stocks benefit, the rest of Americans are just trying to pay the bills honestly, something the trump govt has none of- ethics and honesty. Politics are nasty, but this govt is corrupt.
213 2018-01-29 21:58:25 I was thinking this today cause my neighbor can’t stand him. But keeps referring to her stocks.
214 2018-01-29 21:58:12 @DougPolkPoker can you make a video explaining/justifying valuation for some cryptos? For stocks we can look to P/E...I'm just at a loss for some of these valuations.
215 2018-01-29 21:57:46 QE inflated then drained commodity prices. Certain real estate markets are bubbled, but a growing population also needs housing. Stocks? Problem is concentrated wealth, not # of $ in circulation.

Markets tend towards efficiency, leading to commodity and product price deflation.
216 2018-01-29 21:57:40 I'm guessing RFranks doesn't own any stocks, and is bitter. And, since you're so upset with the tax cuts, you should definitely take your tax cut $ and donate it back to the federal government. Wouldn't want to be a hypocrite or anything, you know, since this is #Armageddon!

224 2018-01-29 21:52:05 Based on 146 years of stock market history since 1871, investors should expect sharply lower returns in the upcoming years. U.S. stocks have posted recent gains that are well above historical averages, the odds also favor below-average gains over the next decade.
225 2018-01-29 21:51:58 10k worth of stocks every year, on my third year(this year) I get 16k yeeeeeeeeet
226 2018-01-29 21:51:53 According to world bank data there are 43,192 public companies in existence. P/E ratios today have been justified in the face of regulatory policies and technological boom. However, only 1384 cryptocurrencies exist as at January 2018. #cryptocurrency #worldbank #stocks

237 2018-01-29 21:44:13 Bums like @thewarden12345 don't realize that the money generated by nearly 400 years of slave labor in America was used by banks to invest in corporations & inherited via trust funds & stocks rich white people use to sustain their labor free existence. Blacks inherited poverty.
238 2018-01-29 21:43:33 If you look closely, you can see one of those bump stocks has a chainsaw attachment.
239 2018-01-29 21:42:15 Why are crypto investors bringing back all of the flawed technical analysis that failed on stocks?
240 2018-01-29 21:42:04 within the span of 30 days I bought my first stocks, made a profit (5% up), and then became convinced that the NYSE is being manipulated by a cartel of evil.

247 2018-01-29 21:40:23 Stock held at 21 day. Most cannabis stocks got clocked today. This one down one penny. Yes it pulled back from $3.30 but it is making a higher high and a higher low all bullish. Haters going to hate.
248 2018-01-29 21:39:58 The economy is strong? A rising DOW average does nothing for 90% of the population a, nor for the economy. It only serves people who bought stocks at a lower price and can now sell at a higher price., i.e. speculators.

321 2018-01-29 21:30:18 You should look into the background of the cannabis companies you invest into. Some can be shady which is a high risk with no payout. Also those doing too well have a higher chance of being raided by feds so stocks go dropping way down.
322 2018-01-29 21:29:52 so #nuu growing in a bigger Neufield thanks to Vic #FFWD share holders get very exciting with where this and other ffwd stocks are heading! multi poundland!!!!!!!
323 2018-01-29 21:29:45 My stocks are doing extremely well too.  (They did well in 2015 and 2016 also.)   But if Trump's Nazi loving supporters decide I'm a shade too brown, maybe I don't survive to enjoy my wealth so much.   Also, I care about other people too.
324 2018-01-29 21:29:04 Watching the data to know when a recession is more likely so you can do a risk and get defensive is what works. That’s my job.The wonderful thing about consumer Stocks is staples tend to perform much better than other sectors but discretionary looks very “market”

327 2018-01-29 21:28:16 @MartinSLewis if I get the cash LISA through Skipton, this won’t affect the stocks and shares one I have? I won’t go over the £20k allowance as only save £50per month in stocks and shares!?

331 2018-01-29 21:24:38 Yes, there are positives, especially in the short run. These positives could have been obtained more responsibly and in a way that would have benefited more middle class people long term. Corps are getting Billions and buying back their stocks. Regular people are getting conned.
332 2018-01-29 21:24:25 I think it would be great for Mr Fort to revisit Stocks & enjoy more of Head Chef Ben's cooking

334 2018-01-29 21:22:20 World stocks fall as 10-year Note yield hits 2.7%: US -.7%; Europe -.2%. A whiff of inflation frightened investors and caused fall in stock and bond prices. Utilities and REITs hit hard. Stock behavior not surprising as investors skittish after sharp rise. Likely short-term.

343 2018-01-29 21:15:11 There are many companies laying off people and aggressively buying back stocks since the #TaxScam was passed. My worry is the extra national debt and underfunding the ACA.

437 2018-01-29 20:36:11 there are always trade-offs except in a bubble where almost every economic indicator is positive. stocks go up/people take money out of banks to buy stocks. govt tax cuts/govt have to borrow keeping business from borrowing. unless everybody using vapor money then all up

439 2018-01-29 20:35:36 5-yr US-DE rate diff widened when euro depreciated in 2014-15, but it widened further this year and euro appreciated. Neither rate diff nor flows explain very much. But it is changes in rate diffs that matter. Flows are changes in stocks, so they matter even at constant rate.
440 2018-01-29 20:35:18 Stocks are done_ if #FOMC is a bit as expected with a good pinch of hawkishness then bonds will stay low and selling pressure will evolve

455 2018-01-29 20:27:57 Yes I agree. And stocks would likely go down once regulations get reinstated which will give the right plenty of propaganda talking points to win back seats etc etc. Really dont want my kids to deal with the mess we’ve made :/

569 2018-01-29 19:41:27 CNBC all the time wrong on many securities, like amazon, MSFT,NVDA, fb , and Apple, all these stocks are good long term rewarding, don’t get panic and give away your holdings to analysts who want to buy on the dip

575 2018-01-29 19:35:38 Stocks grew in value by 36 % in Obama's his first year. As a recent Forbes Headlines states: S&P up 277% since March 2009 low--Trumps owns 11 of them. He's riding on the black man's coat tails. Do a little more research....lake girl

586 2018-01-29 19:29:25 Great. Now stocks and bonds are going down WITH the dollar.  What a covfefe.
587 2018-01-29 19:29:12 I know !  It’s horrible how the economy is roaring , stocks up, manufacturing coming back from oversees , veterans health care better , tax breaks , regulations down , lowest unemployment rate for African Americans since 70’s.  Just terrible how unfit he is.  blind HATE

589 2018-01-29 19:27:30 Rather make 30-40% in packaging/containerboard stocks (WRK/KS/IP) this year than wait 7 years for GE to get their act together. Not to mention GE accounting is a bit suspect. #GEValueTrap Check out KS acquisition today...re-ratings in the packaging sector for early 2018.
590 2018-01-29 19:27:30 Betters sources indicate it’s not likely to happen. If investors are dumping stocks on flimsy reports, they deserve to lose money.
591 2018-01-29 19:27:23 I'm invested in emerging markets and in large cap domestic (among other sectors) Maybe I'm picking the wrong stocks  / funds but this "cyclical emerging market rally" has under-preformed my Dow and S&P 500 investments.
592 2018-01-29 19:26:38 Not to LT or MT bonds in my opinion.  Bonds are overvalued.  Stocks still undervalued.  MLP’s, senior loans.  Fixed to Floater preferreds.  If you need fixed income.
593 2018-01-29 19:26:35 Selling $sbux today after holding for close to 2 years... It sucks big time.. when the profits is pennies... But it is better to sell and mke little bit of profit then stick with the company whose growth is slowing in US.

607 2018-01-29 19:17:50 @AdamtheBullFAN I would suspect the reason the stadium is still selling the gear in the stadium-shops is related to stocks of merch which needs to be sold and/or merch contracts which need to be completed.

617 2018-01-29 19:11:37 @BillBrewerCCP - thought StateServ Medical working on deal with National HME, that must have fallen thru. Wonder when they started negotiations with Stellus & Blue Wolf. It seems after deal w/StateServ, Stellus raised millions of dollars - were they selling stocks or what?

623 2018-01-29 19:10:06 "Lots" relative to what? Starbucks stocks its stores with ~1 day's cash at the beginning of each day. Stocking payment channels with 1 days' bitcoin receipts should be cheaper and easier.

626 2018-01-29 19:09:13 Omg. One of my stocks just had a 91-1 split. I literally just gained almost 500 shares overnight that will be worth almost 3 quarters of a mil (if it steady goes up). 
627 2018-01-29 19:08:57 its a scam to pump up penny stocks and off load it at high prices while undoubting investors loose money

657 2018-01-29 18:54:14 the ten year took at the 2.63% level with ease, on our way to 3%?  the CAPE earnings yield is 2.89%, I think if the ten year gets over that, stocks will feel some real pressure
658 2018-01-29 18:54:00 Stocks go up every day but does not mean there is an edge/repeatable setup everyday. Money is made in casinos every day too. What are the setups here or just stocks that went up today just wondering
659 2018-01-29 18:53:40 If the economy is doing well in November, don't count on that blue wave I've been hearing about.

660 2018-01-29 18:52:47 Effort and attention often bring the opposite of their intended purpose. Think about your need for sleep and you stay awake all night. Actively trade stocks and you lower your returns. Repeatedly reach out to someone you are interested in and you get swerved.

705 2018-01-29 18:25:59 I think they only way most 'average' Americans are involved in the stock market is if they have a retirement account that is invested in stocks but generally I'd say no

710 2018-01-29 18:23:53 Pro Tip Use Different Stocks And Effects
711 2018-01-29 18:22:37 If I understand correctly, the billionaires would have to liquidate their stocks, bonds & real estate holdings to eliminate poverty and that requires buyers. With such a huge sell off the $ returned from sales will go way down...
712 2018-01-29 18:21:55 Hi Josh, you can open both a cash ISA and a Stocks & Shares ISA in the same tax year. However, the total amount you put in cannot exceed £20,000 limit. Hope this helps. ^TM

742 2018-01-29 18:08:25 I remember trump saying the unemployment numbers are fake, made up numbers that mean nothing while Obama was Pres. 
By the way,stocks were going up way before dickhead was Pres.

Why is that?

792 2018-01-29 17:48:42 TIP: Keep your portfolio small, carry a good cash position. Buy cryptos with developing deals and making real progress with their technology. these rise on pure sentiment which is equivalent in this case to stocks booking orders away. No one wants to buy, but fewer want to sell!

Well thought out explanation
"
 A rise in 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +3.03% above 2.71% also has drawn attention, because rising rates can undercut appetite for stocks if government paper offer richer yields than risk assets like stocks."
803 2018-01-29 17:45:15 I don't know, either. Saying "stocks are acting like" is different from saying "stock are down because".

841 2018-01-29 17:27:06 when u buy big vol the operator loses control over his stocks..& pulls it down further to make u nervous & to get his stocks back

845 2018-01-29 17:25:00 There are few better feelings than checking your stock account and seeing a 100+% increase in value for a single stock. 

Second place = all stocks in the portfolio gaining value.

850 2018-01-29 17:23:57 Right. Keep watching CNN every night and bitching about Trump as you watch your 401k and stocks grow. It doesn’t matter what he does you left wing cry babies will find something to complain about. You have 7 more years of whining. Lmfao
851 2018-01-29 17:22:57 I think it is something like 25% of stocks owned by foreign investors. So yes, profits leave the US.
852 2018-01-29 17:21:54 I miss the good old days when bonds and stocks were inversely correlated?
853 2018-01-29 17:21:19 European stocks end session mostly lower UK FTSE only gainer (but just barely).
The major European stock indices have ended the day mostly lower, with the UK the only major market with a gain - but it was a small one.
854 2018-01-29 17:21:10 You invest with stocks ?
855 2018-01-29 17:21:10 That is true sure but the argument is that trump actually did something to effect that. Which he didn’t most of the effect was due to Obama. Policies have at least a 6 month delay in employment rate or stocks.
856 2018-01-29 17:21:00 2017 proved to be a huge year to be in tech and stocks in general (and cyrptocurrencies of course). The most unexpected thing would be if 2018 after this blowoff climax,  turned out to be the  ultimate year to be in cash$$.  If that happens my guess is the reason is war in Korea.
857 2018-01-29 17:20:03 50k cash right now?? I'm shorting a few stocks and doing some long term things
858 2018-01-29 17:19:57 Most of them don't have options, spread is ridiculous to trade options in Canada, then you have to pay for time and volatility, not sure options is the way to go for pot stocks, imo...

860 2018-01-29 17:18:49 Remember when so many equity analysts said that you had to own stocks because the yield of the S&P 500 was higher than the 10-year Treasury yield?  Now I'm hearing them say that higher interest rates are good for stock valuations.  Wow.

868 2018-01-29 17:15:50 I think good stocks make their own path to top, they don't need market's help. Like the famous dialogue,"Janny, market humse bante hain, hum market segment nahin."

912 2018-01-29 17:00:13 Overall the economy is its strongest position since the turn of the millennium. Tax cuts will continue to strengthen job growth and spending. Investors should expect eventual corrections of currently overvalued stocks.

916 2018-01-29 16:57:33 Despite strong economy, investors need now more than ever to be cautious. Many stocks are over valued. Stock picks should be selected individually.

960 2018-01-29 16:41:27 I do not own all the stocks tweeted on. The purpose is to share knowledge! Doesn’t mean I can’t own them or can’t sell what I own at some time in the future for the need of liquidity. Everyone needs to do their own homework, think independently and factor risks.

965 2018-01-29 16:37:08 Very true. Plus stock market not best indicator of economic performance. GDP & others better. Stocks only a part of the picture.
966 2018-01-29 16:37:07 I can think of a few words to describe that level of depraved behavior & they certainly wouldn't be those. $cumbag should be put in stocks for a week and locked up for the rest of his sorry life.
967 2018-01-29 16:37:04 But then again, a "long taper" would probably be bullish stocks too!
968 2018-01-29 16:36:38 $BB But there's not enough of the float that will sell here so I don't get how they can cover without taking it to a nice high. Patience. #stocks #trading #investing

972 2018-01-29 16:34:57 Oil prices fall and market goes down. Oil goes up and market goes down. Solution sell any oil stocks and get out of this commodity as done in Canda. No way for Canada to ship overseas as no pipelines. Rail too expensive
973 2018-01-29 16:34:37 Hope trade -  In this business battle  there will be multiple disruption not just telecom - but also Media  ( read all forms of entertainment ) , Banks , Retail ... So the chase for stocks was Hope for  this disruption  and possible owner of profits
974 2018-01-29 16:34:22 Yes and the stock market is now heavily inflated due to binge buying us stocks at bottom dollar rates and everybsane financial analyst know we are heading for the biggest crash in history if you don't do something intelligent.
975 2018-01-29 16:34:14 So, I'm guessing a "short taper" (whatever that is) is bullish for stocks!?
976 2018-01-29 16:34:05 Other stocks outside BTCs related ones trying best to pick up the pieces.  Looks like I will be down YTD to end Jan.
977 2018-01-29 16:33:58 I am not a Russian Bot either. When Trump sucks, he sucks. When Trump does something good, give him credit. I was a Cruz fan in the primaries and despised Trump. But have to deal with the current reality and quite frankly, my 401k, stocks and paycheck are enjoying the ride.
978 2018-01-29 16:33:47 @Varneyco If people hate Trump so much, they should sell their stocks and donate the money to charity!  They need to put their money where their mouth is!
979 2018-01-29 16:32:19 Off to a bad start with my stocks this morning  last week was great for my portfolio.

981 2018-01-29 16:32:05 Using the CAPE ration to measure valuation is like using Ben Graham's deep value formula to pick stocks. It only works once every 10 years.

983 2018-01-29 16:31:50 Less than 53% Americans own any stocks including in retirement plans. 5% wealthiest own 82% of individual stocks. What did Trump replace the ACA with? Nothing. Healthcare costs up & no plans for improvement. Illegal immigration was on downward trend but Trump made it a big deal.
984 2018-01-29 16:31:49 @BNN When is BNN going to talk about the swan dive on TSX in last 2 weeks. Everything to do with Cdn stocks tanking. Why??? Portfolios managers still want u to buy oil stocks or gas stocks. Why??

986 2018-01-29 16:31:15 @RobinhoodApp @AskRobinhood can you add expand and collapse categories for sorting or listing the stocks. So that my list doesn’t get to big in screen and I don’t have to scroll all way up to bottom.#stocks #StockMarket #cryptocurrency #Crypto
987 2018-01-29 16:30:56 Penny stocks are tough to predict, but we've went from under .10 to .95 in a month so a lot of people will bail.  I had a .50 price target and it went thru that easily so I'm hoping it can close above .58 today.  If not it might be in consolidation for awhile before next move up.

996 2018-01-29 16:27:47 Have to be in stocks for long haul, early numbers from $LMT have eased, up less than .5% at last check. Interesting downside shift going into mid day. Hopeful for afternoon swing higher.
997 2018-01-29 16:27:46 If you want to learn how the markets move and see things at a faster pace is say try penny stocks or crypto. They both have higher volatility and so they move faster but still have similar concepts to the stock market. Invest early!
998 2018-01-29 16:27:39 Every time $FB, or any other $FANG stock dips, it has been a fantastic buying opportunity. I think they will have a good earnings report and climb. If they don’t, they’ll still recover quickly. #stocks #investing

1005 2018-01-29 16:25:16 When I word most of my words by the help of paper sheets & pen then the remaining part of mind usually feel no urge anymore to pen down the inventory of unsaid stocks of my inner self on twitter or elsewhere. So better to be a silent listener, in acute and in an accurate silence.
1006 2018-01-29 16:25:14 Two stocks i am really surprised getting so much love in street $MSFT $INTC #Microsoft does scare a bit because it has been just up and up and up and up. 1 negative in the earning they we hit that lever for free flow. But #Microsoft is just flying in cloud going to be the leader

1009 2018-01-29 16:24:14 Up 20-30% from here makes all the sense in the world. 

Financial system wasn't at risk in 2000-2002, stocks down 50%. We had the "garden-variety" stealth bear in 2015-2016 when earnings dipped like 2%.
1010 2018-01-29 16:23:57 $SPY As profit taking takes place in overall markets I continue to focus on what I believe to be select stocks/ETF's Example $LABU $BLOK etc
1011 2018-01-29 16:23:50 @MassGovernor … Mr. Governor!  I heard your interview about bump stocks.  I guess your view is “It’s the law and we must enforce the laws”.  Now, let’s discuss all those “Illegal Aliens” we have in the state … why aren’t THOSE LAWS being enforced?  Never again Charlie …
1012 2018-01-29 16:23:43 It now appears obvious that most #MREIT stocks will reduce divs in the first quarter...question is....at what price is that "new information" discounted?  I suspect lower from here.
1013 2018-01-29 16:23:12 $AAPL might miss the numbers of unit sales but the the forecast with the cash repatriation might boost the stocks after earning, looking for a bottom to add some calls, $FB might consolidate after earnings as their operating cost gonna sky up so after earnings calls make sense
1014 2018-01-29 16:22:11 And a nice day to make bump stocks illegal.

1017 2018-01-29 16:20:53 It's a feel good measure, I lived in WA and want to again but the bump stocks are a minor thing compared to suicide and handgun crime. Fed level needs to be digitalized for background checks.

1029 2018-01-29 16:13:49 Price action is different today. Be careful with stocks that have had steep runs. Might see some consolidation next. Risk mgmt is always important.

1031 2018-01-29 16:12:15 wall street taking the day to clobber  stocks today since few earnings reported, common theme amongst scammers like them. buy shorts, mass sell their client's stocks, buy back at lower basis, mostly for themselves. e.g. look at lrcx since reporting great earnings, what a scam

The bump stocks may be here to stay, but those who are serious gun owners and users tend to ignore them. I won't become involved in a gun debate. It does nothing but both sides stating their opinions.

1089 2018-01-29 15:54:57 Almost seems like stocks are a commodity these days. 
More about supply and demand than valuation. 
Also seems like the supply of money is huge these days.
1090 2018-01-29 15:54:23 It is only after a stock goes up 20X, people start noticing the moat characteristics with full momentum.

Spotting them when it is a microcap- that’s the thrill of value investing.

1097 2018-01-29 15:51:41 Since the stock market going up has nothing to do with Trump, so says Leftist Democrats, stocks going down clearly shows it’s because of Trump.  Just wait......you will hear that.

1204 2018-01-29 15:27:06 I absolutely agree with you - if I have a pension plan that invests in stocks and shares, it very clearly states the risk factors ie they go up and down.  It’s shameful that people are making money when a company is going down the pan and others are losing their jobs.

1211 2018-01-29 15:23:55 And why do you say it can hurt them in the long run? Are you saying this bc you don’t believe in crypto? If that’s the case, couldn’t you argue they already do that that by giving uneducated investors a platform to invest in stocks?
1212 2018-01-29 15:23:53 Well my retirement returned me about 23% last year sooo. 

Again, I don’t have the confidence to purchase random stocks. I’m more worried about paying my debt off than trying to stick money that I don’t have into things that might lose. I don’t have time for the stock market.

So falling 30 year yields will cause people to sell stocks and then buy the falling 30 year yield????
1215 2018-01-29 15:21:49 Back to the point though.

Budgeting is amazing, and if you boys can find some money to dabble in commission free stocks you’ll get a free one using that link : the free one ranges from Apple, Facebook, Netflix($150-250 respectively) to something lame like Sirius XM($5)

1359 2018-01-29 14:12:54 Ok. Your right the Dow isn't the stock market as it's only represented by the few publicly traded stocks in its particular universe. But neither the Dow nor the stock market as a whole are the economy.

Except, you can actually sell stocks.

1378 2018-01-29 14:01:48 Dear Trump apologists: the wealthiest 10% own 82% of stocks in America (an average of $969,000 each). Stock speculators like Trump’s Gilded Age, but what about the rest of the nation? Only 52% of Americans own any stock at all.

But once again notable was there continued heavy buying in stocks futures which was very bullish...

1411 2018-01-29 13:43:28 The Dow is not the economy. Most Americans don't have stocks.
1412 2018-01-29 13:43:19 Buckle up loves. Even tho most of us don’t have much, if any, skin in the stocks & bonds game- it appears as if the wall may have been hit.

If the market tanks behind the bond slump, we all lose bigly. This bubble is SO much larger than the last.

If you have a 401k, eyes open.

1419 2018-01-29 13:39:19 Not on the indexes ... spreads are not large enough considering the risk.  I do some on individual stocks when an expansion phase begins/is early.  Cheers

1422 2018-01-29 13:38:00 Stocks down slightly this morning, apparently worried about rising interest rates.  But rates are rising on good economic news, so stocks have little to fear.  We use a 3.5% 10-year yield in our stock market valuation model...it still says stocks undervalued.

You have to sell.
Not necessarily all, or at once.
But you have to sell to convert paper gain to cash.
HODLing is a looser strategy.

And if so, do you have any advice to help deciding which one of the many breakouts one should favour?Every day there are a bunch of them, so I'm unsure which one to take at this point if all look ok

1486 2018-01-29 13:12:24 Hi Alex, I am sorry but this is something that the marketing department are in control of and it would be under until stocks last. I am sorry but I would suggest going into store as it would be under management discretion. Thanks, Parm

1495 2018-01-29 13:04:31 The problem here is not palm oil (on which we can agree the industry is a huge problem) but judging and criticizing people with low revenues buying Nutella to please their kids. I don't know if it went intl, but a french food chain made a huge deal on Nutella stocks for people.
1496 2018-01-29 13:04:27 These celebs don’t care about us. They have millions of dollars. A tax cut means “crumbs” to them. It IS meaningful to people like me. Check your retirement accts. Take advantage of stocks now. Don’t miss out. Times have never been so economically good and I’m enjoying it.

1633 2018-01-29 10:57:59 Why am I seeing long lines for the Aztec Healing Clay, some even have to get numbers to claim the product the following day? Are they on a mad sale? Are they running out of stocks? I visited stand alone Healthy Options stores that have a rack full of AHC. Why?
1634 2018-01-29 10:56:41 I bet in private they are praising President Trump since their stocks have increased enormously since he took office.

The price is high because the FV is premised on a high growth rate, and so therefore the discounted PV is high, even though present earning are low. The Q becomes: is the growth rate reasonable?

1867 2018-01-29 07:47:52 I understand it tax deferrable, automatically comes out of my pay check, and is in an index of equity stocks. I’m guessing the benchmark is the s&p but I don’t really care enough to check. I’m only doing it for later in life as a safety net. Not to build wealth now.
1868 2018-01-29 07:47:35 u may consider AKCapital, Reliance infra, reliance cap, jindal drilling, allcargo logistics, karnataka bank , REC etc. As u know them most of them are value propositions than hot stocks.

1874 2018-01-29 07:42:01 There are sooooo many advantages to Fx over stocks. SO MANY. Yes it’s not as fast... but you’d be surprised what your account would look like in a couple of months. Sometimes slower can become faster.
1875 2018-01-29 07:41:56 a. most stocks in the world do not have an s-1 and are publicly trade. You are American-centric

b. almost all "coins" are publicly traded without an S-1.

There are lots of ways you could be wrong.

1980 2018-01-29 06:14:30 I disagree... stocks are going a lot higher. This has been the most bearish, stock bull market on record. Capital is moving from the real bubble (bonds) and into tangible assets (Stocks, Gold etc). Public to Private.
1981 2018-01-29 06:14:20 NIFTY/Banknifty and most of the midcap stocks moving just opposite........traders having tough time.....

2125 2018-01-29 03:52:11 Big Hit doesn't have a stock price because it is a private company (it doesn't sell stocks), so don't expect news about stock price of Big Hit.

2139 2018-01-29 03:39:27 SM is a public company while Big Hit is a private company. There won't be news about SM's stock price if it was not publicly traded in the market. Private companies, including Big Hit, do not sell stocks so they do not have stock prices. Is it all clear now?

2149 2018-01-29 03:31:28 Yeah @BarackObama inherited wars, recession & high unemployment
@realDonaldTrump inherited stock market highs & low unemployment. 
By your analogy 45 should be blaming @POTUS44 for high stocks & low unemployment.

2186 2018-01-29 03:11:28 Trading stocks is trading on probabilities that a stock price will move in the favor of your trade. There is risk and the outcome is unknown with each trade.

Why? It's all about capital flows.
2190 2018-01-29 03:08:38 The point is that bump stocks are unnecessary. How many more shootings in our state do we need before we have better regulations on firearms? School shooting in Graham, and police officer killed in Fredrickson are just 2 examples in recent weeks.

2214 2018-01-29 02:53:32 It's definitely not a whole lot different than stocks. A prospect not panning out costs hundreds of thousands. A free agent not panning out costs millions. Uggla, Upton, Kwakami... Free agency should compliment developed prospects, IMO... not replace them 3, 4 or 5:1.

2242 2018-01-29 02:35:12 Bump stocks are not guns. IMHO any device that can be used to convert a weapon to full auto should be illegal. That does not mean you can take my gun.
2243 2018-01-29 02:34:05 And bump stocks are still legal.
2244 2018-01-29 02:32:50 Beautiful and sad. And Bump Stocks are still legal.
2245 2018-01-29 02:32:38 Dude I’m military I know what it means. And funny how you mean to insult with snowflakes but my experience with Twitter is the snowflakes are mostly on the right. Bump up stocks are legal. Nice try.

2249 2018-01-29 02:30:02 I’m pretty confident twitter and Facebook could disappear today and few would even miss them. I’m thinking that means the stocks are a bit over their skis

2377 2018-01-29 01:22:09 The USA  has had 11 Mass Shooting since the beginning of the year. In our home we believe you and your majority are Accessories to Each Senseless Murder since you put these weapons in the streets.
You wouldnt move on Bump Stocks.
Again we only hear false witness
2378 2018-01-29 01:21:59 Oh yeah, though over time Bush started freezing him out & disempowering him. Of course by then we were in 2 wars & Haliburton stocks were soaring....
2379 2018-01-29 01:21:55 600-300-100 #stockmarket strategy...  for every 1,000 you save put 600 into your normal couple stocks, keep 300 in cash so you can buy the dips and buy 100$ into a speculative stock that could go up a lot!

2382 2018-01-29 01:17:09 stocks to make the board member filthy rich we would have enough tax revenue to keep inflation in check.

Yes we need to get off fossil fuels as quickly as possible before we kill this planet. 
Green energy created more jobs in US than fossil anyway. Of course Trump is killing
2383 2018-01-29 01:15:49 @timothysykes thanks for responding, I’m impressed and think it’s the sign of a good CEO. I read that you’re from CT, I’m in New Canaan, originally from NYC. I look forward to a year of swing trading penny stocks.
2384 2018-01-29 01:15:06 It doesn’t make sense to wait for our targets until the summer, if they have good World cups they’re stocks will rise, just pay what’s necessary and show some ambition with that coutinho money! Ffs.
2385 2018-01-29 01:14:13 Stocks fair better when dollar is low.
2386 2018-01-29 01:13:06 Not for long! They can't ignore their bank accts, 401k, stocks...jobs

2388 2018-01-29 01:08:33 I would caution people from crypto currencies.
They seem very unstable.
You could lose alot.
It feels like penny stocks.
2389 2018-01-29 01:08:02 False meme. My stocks lost or stalled during the Obama presidency. Have steadily climbed since Trump started repairing the Obama damage.
2390 2018-01-29 01:06:33 My stocks.  Made sure i was not fined for not havong insurance.. and thats just for starters
2391 2018-01-29 01:05:36 @wsj "Stocks and Treasurys are in the midst of what Goldman Sachs calls the most “extreme” start to a year ever."
2392 2018-01-29 01:04:14 I don't think most people have the money to invest in grad school, tbh. On top of that, I'm not sure if you're speaking of investing in the sense of analyzing stocks yourself, but if you are it's a seductive but bad to idea to consider dabbling in that. (Replied to wrong tweet)

2394 2018-01-29 01:02:14 This seems to go against everything cryptos were developed for.  Ive got a retirement plan with my job but I bet the 600 I just started with 2 weeks ago in cryptos will be worth more than 6 yrs of employer contributions to bullshit stocks by next December.

2399 2018-01-29 00:58:11 What favys that tax scam isnt creatibg jobs just opposite? Or that companies are reinvesting in stocks driving market on course to burst worse than 2009?
2400 2018-01-29 00:56:59 If he’s smart, he’ll cop some income-producing real estate and stocks, before he spends all his $$ on the Man’s consumable products. Just sayin’...
2401 2018-01-29 00:56:53 I do not sit here and pump stocks based on potentially speculative drilling results.... I may own a few spec miners but it is a lottery sometimes... lot easier to analyse businesses with solid and growing revenue.  Do yourself a favour and look at $ZNO and $SP3 and $SW1
2402 2018-01-29 00:55:52 If he’s smart, his next move will be to purchase income-producing real estate and stocks, before he spends all his $$ on the Man’s consumable products. Just sayin’...

2404 2018-01-29 00:55:38 You are wrong on all accounts except stocks which benefit no one but the 1%
2405 2018-01-29 00:53:59 15%? I'd hold tight and feel glad that I moved from 100%/0% stocks/bonds to 90/10 during 2017. :)  

30%? I'd be viewing that as a buying opportunity.
2406 2018-01-29 00:53:58 Parce que les gens qui n ont pas suffisamment  d argent pour en acheter habituellement pour leurs enfants. Se sont rués dessus pour faire des stocks. Et ils ont bien fait. Passez donc à autre  chose.on s attend à mieux de votre part
2407 2018-01-29 00:53:50 The stock market is doing well- who knows when it will self correct. Other areas continue trends set during Obama’s tenure. Glad you kep generally upward trend! U know only about 50% of US own stocks including in 401ks

2410 2018-01-29 00:52:50 Tax cuts. Low rates. Low unemployment. Low volatility. Relative peace. And most importantly, Assurance from central bankers to quickly come to the rescue should markets fall. Surprised stocks are still soOoo cheap. @benbernanke @federalreserve
2411 2018-01-29 00:51:25 I can understand him not understanding how stocks work but you're right, as the comm director Toby should absolutely have seen that the correlation between his stock buy, the testimony and why the situation looks so bad.

2416 2018-01-29 00:43:38 The only people making money is the wealthy. I'm sure there aren't  many POOR people holding  stocks. I guess we can ask Jay-Z.
2417 2018-01-29 00:42:07 This why I call the Bureau of Labor Statistics B u L S h i t. The new "Gig Economy" is obviously bullshit. The problem is America doesn't make anything anymore. This needs to change. It kind of touches on (4) Co. need to start investing in their bus. and not buying back stocks.

2433 2018-01-29 00:30:17 Trump removed Obama's American economy destroying executive orders and the economy is booming. I deal in stocks and that is partially how my net worth increased by 10. You deal in EBT money and live day to day on handouts by my tax dollars. In other words, a Democrat leech.

2440 2018-01-29 00:22:48 The stock market has nothing to do with jobs. 80 % of the market is owed by 20% of ppl. It's normal fluctuations. It will even in the end. Most Americans live paycheck to paycheck. They don't own stocks. They have no retirement. He could give a crap.

2451 2018-01-29 00:15:42 Read great article where stocks to bond yields are out of kilter & will drop 50% by mid 2019 looking at CAPE.
Been there for 20 years so will see though.

2455 2018-01-29 00:11:12 Pero ¿que ocurrirá con aquellos medicamentos que sólo se consiguen en cadenas de farmacias? Las farmacias de barrio no manejan esos stocks. (Ahora, no soy experto en el tema ni mucho menos, pero me parece una preocupación válida)
2456 2018-01-29 00:10:33 Yep. Best time to load up on stocks such as $TSM $AMD $NVDA
2457 2018-01-29 00:07:53 No, there is an EXTREME difference from $XRP and $GBTC. SEC can’t control or have any jurisdiction on $XRP yet. $GBTC needed SEC approval. Crypto doesn’t need approval. Not sure but you might need to brush up on your knowledge on Stocks and Crypto, last post on this CCNA study.
2458 2018-01-29 00:07:03 Stocks 2 Watch: $WQNI $VAPR $EVRN $RSII and $HMPQ should bounce...fingers crossed
2459 2018-01-29 00:04:23 I always wondered what happened to IMEEM. They never prompted shareholders they were about to crash? That's messed up. I 30+ Penny Stocks with multiple companies and I try to keep up with all of the news on everyone of them.
2460 2018-01-29 00:04:11 And it’s all because of you, Mr. President. You wanting to bring America back to where it should be. I know I will get many complaints about my tweet. I don’t care.   I think he’s doing a great job, the Stocks, my investments has never been better in 20 years. Thank you.

2465 2018-01-29 00:02:25 Sorry but the Cratchit theory of poverty is a falacy. I worked with (and employed) many lower payed people. What do they spend money on instead of stocks? Tattoos, smokes, drugs, booze, cell phones, check cashing, etc. Learn how the world actually works and go enjoy your life.
2466 2018-01-29 00:01:37 Been cleaning up & moving funds to known moving on trend stocks.

Keeping losers never helps and affects overall trading. Once sold; brings great feeling & better concentration to start new trade :)
2467 2018-01-29 00:01:00 Not that PB&Js are culinary endeavors, but I learned to cook for the most part after I learned to work in a lab, and before that was taught to cook by a mother who worked in a lab. You'd never use the same implement on separate stocks.
