Can only make big money in penny stocks if you play with big money. 

Which you generally don't if you enjoy keeping your money.

65 2018-01-22 23:24:45 While stocks crashed in 2008, I was listening to Lightspeed Champion 'Midnight Suprise'
66 2018-01-22 23:24:35 We’re just over 30 minutes away from the official kickoff to championship night with the Thunder Stocks taking to the track first!

The track has been slightly worked in to start the night.
67 2018-01-22 23:24:32 No credit cards, please.  Sell high risk stocks instead, if you need money.
68 2018-01-22 23:20:35 How are the stocks
69 2018-01-22 23:20:31 Do stocks go up for any reason before they come down for any reason?
70 2018-01-22 23:19:45 Definitely heard some actual children discussing crypto currency and stocks on the bus earlier. These are the youths that vacation in aspen.
71 2018-01-22 23:18:58 Hold on a moment, let me get this straight.

So 80% of stocks are owned by the top 10%, right?

And last year, 82% of all newly created wealth went to the top 1%

And the stock market is at all time highs? 

Is this really a system that is "working"? Sure doesn't look like it.
72 2018-01-22 23:18:53 Pot stocks are the place to be again.
73 2018-01-22 23:18:05 you keep thinking they need to 'work' for stocks. think outside the box and i'd be they work.
74 2018-01-22 23:17:59 @billgunderson Hi Bill I am a subscriber to the app.  I would like to be able to load a number of stocks into stockcharts so I scan quickly scan the charts.  is their a way with the PC version to export a number of stocks to look for breakouts?  E.G. export the top 200 conserv.
75 2018-01-22 23:16:57 $SPY The assumption is everyone is making money. Reality is some are missing out on great trades out of fear of thinking stocks will go down
76 2018-01-22 23:16:02 IRS works on a voluntary compliance basis. It is up to the investor or trader to prove with their own records what sales and exchanges were profitable and which were losses. Short term and long term are taxed at different rates. In stocks we use lots to match up buys/sells. 1/2
77 2018-01-22 23:14:12 Didn’t Harper have something like 70 ethics complaints against him! And he utterly ignored every one! And every one much more serious. Did you agree that Lauren should take over his stocks and sell while he was PM?

81 2018-01-22 23:11:30 Not only banks but btc will screw Wall Street too I see a future when stocks will be converted into crypto entirely and these so called Strategist will go homeless

89 2018-01-22 23:06:49 It is frustrating when the market does not see what you can see, sitting on 10 baggers and just a little patience will bring these stocks to fruition. Like a certain stock sitting at 0.06 and in 12 months will be closer to a dollar.

94 2018-01-22 23:04:33 well, the markets have opened for another day. good luck to all of those trading stocks, shares and futures today.
95 2018-01-22 23:04:18 Interest rates going lower is good for stocks because cheap capital.  Interest rates increasing is good for stocks because it signals high confidence in the health of the economy.
96 2018-01-22 23:03:37 It will be good to have a correction to have better entry point considering valuations. Difference between crash and correction is good stocks will recover soon and craps will sediment on correction. Crash normally happens based on economic conditions.

How many mass murders happened last week with bump stocks?

How many mass murders happened last month with bump stocks?

How many mass murders happened last year with bump stocks?

It seems that you are just want justification for your piecemeal gun ban...
106 2018-01-22 22:59:19 Why can’t they at least buy stocks in somewhat decent companies too?  Do they all have to be the evilest companies?
107 2018-01-22 22:59:07 Will take a look. Wondering how different the holdings are relative to the Global X ETF LIT. I believe that holds all the lithium mining stocks and Tesla. I imagine the KranesShares version also gives exposure to Nvidia.
108 2018-01-22 22:58:20 The demand for our investments is largely a function of the trade deficit. The $ have to go somewhere, and since we don't have enough goods and services trade surplus countries want, they buy U.S. T-Bonds, stocks, real estate.
109 2018-01-22 22:57:01 Schiller has some great write ups comparing housing long term to stocks.  Usually stocks come out ahead in the long term.  If you paid cash for a place thats a bit different but if you adjust for interest on mortgages, maintenance, taxes over those 15+ years... it adds up
110 2018-01-22 22:56:27 we are at that time of year where penny stocks make runs that will blow your mind most are junk stocks but every so often you get a legit bad ass like $SRMX that comes along that REALLY shakes up the penny market! Notice the insane volume that's all I'm gonna say!
111 2018-01-22 22:55:26 you sure yap alot, but continue to harass despite "politely asking to stop"... much like everything else about you (including your fake stocks you want to talk about so badly) are a FRAUD. Bye bye.
112 2018-01-22 22:55:20 I love how you said "a few minutes"!  lol  Stocks can consolidate for months..were talking minutes!  :)

115 2018-01-22 22:54:36 But, you know, going for a Norway or a Switzerland deal could really screw up on-line shopping. Either larger stocks have to be held in UK - which will put the prices up - or some items might get delayed in customs plus there'd be customs duty - or you're restricted to UK stuff.
116 2018-01-22 22:54:26 Can I just go ghost till I’m 21 y’all.

120 2018-01-22 22:50:18 @Bearpigman LRT: This is why I invest in stocks like someone who isn't an idiot. I put in probably less than 5% of what that guy spent on those cards and have made more money.

133 2018-01-22 22:44:43 Not purely with stocks or real estate because those can crash. I invest millions $ and I need government bonds to make it near zero risk. Tell me how you do it without them and I'm all ears.
134 2018-01-22 22:44:41 I agree with Dan, but Broadcomm too $$$ for me right now. Loved Tim’s take on the cannabis stocks, though.

135 2018-01-22 22:44:39 But you've argued that putting it in an index fund IS contributing, because all stocks are investment.

In this view, all the contributions he provided to the economy would have been even greater if he put it in an index fund and then spent thirty years in a coma.
136 2018-01-22 22:44:05 2020 THE MARKET WILL BE A HOT MESS. Invest in stocks while you can and get the fuck out!
137 2018-01-22 22:43:59 @CNBC Dan Nathan was put in his place last week,  beautiful but being in cryptos and weed stock is irresponsible to naive investors that will follow him into obscenely dangerous stocks.   Why is this fool still on your show at all?
138 2018-01-22 22:43:46 So a soaring economy is bad and the reasons stocks plateaued under Obama is because buyers and sellers didn't want to seem mean by making more money

That makes sense
139 2018-01-22 22:43:11 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to improve your EDS

Enhanced consumer interest in blockchain and cannabis-related securities drove a further surge in engagement in the final weeks of the quarter, particularly among first-time investors," Hockey said in a statement.
143 2018-01-22 22:41:27 Capital gains from stocks and tax avoidance are activities that are by no means risk free. They can only become so with government bonds as hedge (as you said), but precisely on account of their risk free income. It's how I myself reduce risk big time in my portfolio.
144 2018-01-22 22:40:21 Reminder: 92.2% of big investment firms underperform index funds.

Think of how many investment bankers there are; how many billions of dollars they make.

Almost all of them are worse at investing than a crumpled notecard with "S&P 500 stocks" written in crayon

151 2018-01-22 22:36:54 Even if crypto crashes and burns I think it’s great that it’s teaching so many young people (including myself) about markets, stocks, etc. I’ve learned a lot and I’m still learning. I’m still no expert though. I made this account to continue learning #crypto
152 2018-01-22 22:36:09 It’s simple. If Dems are blamed for deaths by a small percentage of violent illegal immigrants than republicans are responsible for every death via gun violence since bump stocks are still openly sold. Quite simple and logical.

154 2018-01-22 22:35:31 Been wrestling with same thing for 5 years. Entire game has been flipped. Assets are finite and cash is infinite essentially making old fashioned liquidity crunch impossible. Personally think stocks reflecting scarcity rather than traditional value

156 2018-01-22 22:34:48 I think most ppl issue, including myself, with stocks is they are tangible & depending on what you choose to invest in you may never get a return, hypothetically. Where are something like real estate it always goes up eventually. Also, most ppl think stocks take alot of time
157 2018-01-22 22:34:07

165 2018-01-22 22:30:01 certainly arguable.   It is also arguable that the legal protections you cite would have done little.  How many investors read prospectuses cover to cover?  How many pink sheet stocks get pumped up without prosecution?   Remember, ICO FRAUD can be prosecuted with current rules.

261 2018-01-22 21:45:26 sometimes i think the reason why these uglies go after junmyeon is because they cant accept someone is too nice and sees him as an easy target. just because his fans are bunnies doesnt mean we cant fight lol i have stocks of poisoned carrot cake & carrot juice.
262 2018-01-22 21:44:59 Many stocks are closed for weeks for new members. No new members, less fresh investments. Less cash flow. Just my thinking.
263 2018-01-22 21:44:27 When stocks, indices, futures are all going up relentlessly... everybody is a successful investor.... hang on to your pants if there is a change in character

283 2018-01-22 21:32:37 The concept of bull or bear market, easily accessible to anyone’s glance, reduces thousands of a stocks to a new conceptual unit on which market observations are built. #epistemology
284 2018-01-22 21:32:31 Another small red day today. Was at quota and kept playing. Gotta be smarter and have to learn when to enter on these parabolic stocks for shorts. Keep entering too soon. But exited at pre set risk. Haven’t let them run away in a while - proud of that.

287 2018-01-22 21:31:25 So the fact bump-stocks were used in the single deadliest on-person shooting spree in US history isn’t a ‘correlation’? And if we have to ban them to find a correlation, and you oppose banning them without a correlation, how exactly does that work? #neleg

300 2018-01-22 21:27:24 In general, with most of these dogshit penny stocks people are pumping on twitter, its pretty clear what they are trying to do... If they are saying buy, guess what they are doing? Selling/Shorting. They are trying to lure in retail gamblers, from what I understand it works.

313 2018-01-22 21:20:59 World stocks rally: US +.8%; Europe +.3%. Relief at end of shutdown catalyzed US rally. General positive momentum from expected 3.9% worldwide growth gives investors reason to continue to tale on risk. Bond-proxy stocks likely to underperform.
314 2018-01-22 21:20:41 They are happy with stocks....
315 2018-01-22 21:20:38 Stocks are up about 5% in January on S&P 500 Index. The breadth is exhausted, but it’s going to be a good year for large caps. Potential upside of 20-25% with P/E expansion in 2018. I’d like to see a consolidation until March, but pullbacks will be bought. $SPX

317 2018-01-22 21:19:38 I can advise you to buy some Costco stocks while they’re under $200 a share. Sams club just closed 60+ stores which means wholesale competition for Costco is basically non existent.

327 2018-01-22 21:16:29 In a "normal" year a 10% gain in stocks would be considered a good return. YTD the S&P 500 is +6.0%. Nasdaq is +7.3%. So nobody would say you're crazy if you decided to cash in a few chips. It's not investing that requires courage today -- it's profit-taking.
328 2018-01-22 21:16:26 Are you sure? Stocks are a lot more volatile than cryptos. I mean you can swing them, but no daytrade.

330 2018-01-22 21:15:40 Why stocks go up: Assume stock trades at 20 P/E with $1 gross profit. At 35% tax rate, net profit is $0.65, stock price=$13. Now cut tax to 21%, with no improvement in economy, gross profit stays at $1, net profit becomes $0.79, stock should trade at $15.8, a 21.5% increase @CNBC
331 2018-01-22 21:15:39 Oh snap would love to have one of those lol

fuck yeah.
402 2018-01-22 20:48:03 Jim- loved your book WWOWS 4ed. What (single or composite) ratio would you recommend as to complement a portfolio consisting of VC2- & mom-comp- (and combinations thereof) stocks? I'm thinking I could benefit from other (uncorrelated?) factors such as quality or fin strength. BR!
403 2018-01-22 20:46:38 That’s how q stocks work
404 2018-01-22 20:46:05 $VTGN 1.30 the next key break or is 1.42 and next it could approach 1.57s area ma 200 zone area imo
405 2018-01-22 20:45:40 Three stocks from my Sunday watch list breaking out today.  Many more setting up as we move further into earnings season.
406 2018-01-22 20:44:51 Crypto getting all the buzz but some of these moves in large-cap, individual stocks have been nuts. Never seen anything like it.
407 2018-01-22 20:44:04 As u know, I also give tips for current stocks to keep an eye on. I'm here FOR YOU, my man.
408 2018-01-22 20:43:18 Just like the “Booming” economy, and stocks. Gona be interesting to see these charts in a few years
409 2018-01-22 20:42:55 @IGClientHelp do your SIPPs offer trading services for illiquid nano-cap stocks listed on UK, Australian and Canadian exchanges? Are all AIM stocks available to trade?
410 2018-01-22 20:41:51 which Canadian pot stocks  twmjf?acfbb

412 2018-01-22 20:41:33 #Soybeans & Wheat closed higher.  Corn unch.  Cattle higher, Hogs lower. US #stocks rallied after Senate passed bill to finance the government for 2 weeks.  Crude was higher.  Gold unch.  #Platinum & Dollar were lower.
413 2018-01-22 20:41:28 Dude even stocks going down is bullish at this point.
414 2018-01-22 20:41:25 When the stock market crashes, bitcoin will:

$BTC $stocks $Crypto $xrp $sc $btg $bch $market $usd
415 2018-01-22 20:41:07 I mean it's one of the core resources for the game. It'd be like starting a match with stocks set to none. Now, if you mean banning oceans, or rain, things start to get really interesting.
416 2018-01-22 20:41:04 Just another reason to buy more stocks! 
417 2018-01-22 20:40:21 @BarclaysUKHelp do you offer trading services on AIM-listed stocks in your SIPPs? I'm also interested in SIPPs that will allow me to trade nano-cap/micro-cap illiquid Australian and Canadian stocks. Are these available?

423 2018-01-22 20:38:22 @realDonaldTrump Stocks rose more in Obama’s first year than in Trumps? Yahoo Finances Rick Newman. Figures Lie and Liars Figure
424 2018-01-22 20:37:58 but from the bank side, they use your money to buy stocks daily, so when you are not at least having that amount in your account then they are not making money, so they have to make money somehow lol that is their whole set up.
425 2018-01-22 20:36:20 Theory: VIX drop due to surge in passive investing (not my idea). Surge in passive investing is a return to pre-1971 investing and long-term planning.  I.e., you don't pick stocks. Your goal is to save money. If you want capital preservation, you can put it in a bank and ...
426 2018-01-22 20:36:09 I remember the Dems saying stocks would plummet when Trump took office, so if it’s success is due to BO, why didn’t all your liberal analysts see that coming. Keep changing narrative to suit your needs.
427 2018-01-22 20:33:38 2 more weeks left of the lunar year sorry, still stoned
428 2018-01-22 20:33:08 Everyone buy now in this dip, in about 2 morw weeks, the asain culture is celebrating lunar year, so its expected to see this drop in the market, when they are done celebrating, they will reinvest everything back within the next couple weeks to a month, so buy now and hold!
429 2018-01-22 20:32:40 Most beginners don't have a "plan" of an entry/exit in #crypto or stocks.

They are afraid to jump in as it's going low, but when everything goes on a bull run they WISH it DIPS again... Well, here's the truth: YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO CATCH THE VERY BOTTOM/TOP.
Add on dips! #BTFD

431 2018-01-22 20:31:46 Why, WHY DO I OWN BOTH OF THESE STOCKS???
432 2018-01-22 20:30:52 Thanks Spencer. YEah, I thought I saw a pattern of a notable sell off ahead of each of these. Prolly the summer one too and prolly having to do with commodities, especially oil - more so than stocks. We'll see if 2006 or more like 2011/2014!
433 2018-01-22 20:30:43 Justin Sibears of Newfound Research: “we’re in the equivalent of tech bubble for 60/40 portfolio. I’ve never seen stocks and bonds so overvalued at the same time.” #InsideETFs
434 2018-01-22 20:30:07 Saw that. Have been accumulating for next big run weird hasn't follow other cannabis stocks today I think when this goes it's going faster and harder than people think. Get a 10x or 100x valuation like most others we'd would be well above $1.00
435 2018-01-22 20:29:18 No worries for stocks, central banks stand ready and willing to lift all offers
436 2018-01-22 20:28:54 also: even if 'Bitcoin Prime' suffers Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly, multiple teams can adopt archived ledger, spinfork as claim of-heir-to-legacy, giving BTC balances residual 'airdrop' value – impossible with stocks

I really hope McConnell tells you and your socialist base to eat crow! So how are your stocks doing Since TRUMP+3%GDP compared to Obama's dismal 1.72%
442 2018-01-22 20:26:56 Well it’s been pretty dire for me since 1st Jan ! other than a few examples - a fair few of my stocks are turnarounds or M&A hopefuls (WYG, AUK, CNCT) that will yo-yo. TST fundraise also a temp set back. Inland $INL.L on the  and in top 6 now. ASH.L / $HYNS results this week

444 2018-01-22 20:25:35 Almost 100 Americans are killed each day in gun related incidents.  Where is the bipartisan legislation that bans assault rifles and bump stocks,  better regulates gun shows, enhanced background checks of gun owners, and removes illegal weapons from the streets?
445 2018-01-22 20:22:51 So you want to keep bump stocks as a useless ‘novelty’, even though they were recently used in a recent horrific mass-murder, because of some hypothetical slippery slope? I’m generally not impressed by slippery slope arguments, and this one seems particularly weak. #NELEG
446 2018-01-22 20:22:49 Kinda curious about ETFs... I've been trading options in common stocks...
447 2018-01-22 20:22:35 I don't know. But I doubt he is aggressively buying stocks after this kind of advance.
448 2018-01-22 20:22:33 The same things happen in stocks and forex. Some MMs have very deep pockets.
449 2018-01-22 20:22:14 A few of my stocks jumped...kindermorgan for one
450 2018-01-22 20:21:58 Stocks and trump said a few years ago are not an good economy indicator. Has anyone told trump that under his watch the dollar keeps dropping?
451 2018-01-22 20:21:47 Look on ebay, prices for iota,

453 2018-01-22 20:20:24 He normally grates on me but he even got me excited! If I knew anything about stocks I think I'd buy em all. Haha.
454 2018-01-22 20:20:23 People use bump stocks all the time. Still considered a novelty to many. But no reason to be outlawed. Give an inch, they'll take a mile.
455 2018-01-22 20:20:06 There is only one side of the market and it is not the bull side or the bear side, but the right side. #forex #stocks

464 2018-01-22 20:16:47 Bump stocks are not a modification. They do not change the functionality of the rifle.
The same effect can be achieved with your thumb and a belt loop.
Bump stocks are an accessory.
465 2018-01-22 20:16:13 Lol oh naw. Just niggas who buy/are interested in stocks. There aren’t any real answers in that game anyway. It’s all a gamble

469 2018-01-22 20:15:18 those regulations where put there to protect the people from predatory practices by your cronies rich friends, your own base has not realized yet that they dont own stocks,no raise for them,no ACA for them, cant wait for the 2018 elections
470 2018-01-22 20:15:14 Stocks don’t have to go up for this to go down. All it takes for uvxy to go down is the ring of a bell. Same bell gets it to stop going down only it’s later in the day
471 2018-01-22 20:14:59 Niggaz who preaching about stocks cuz they purchased some? But when u start asking them questions they can’t answer none of them? Lol we don’t need those

474 2018-01-22 20:12:47 Uh. Nope. Stocks go bust if a company goes bust. Bitcoin survives as long as the network survives. Since the network is robust, growing and has perceived value, it will continue to exist. It’s value is intrinsic in the same sense as gold. Stocks are entirely different.
475 2018-01-22 20:12:15 Naw.. never mad at niggaz tryna get money.. but niggaz be acting like they been knowin about stocks before cryptocurrency
476 2018-01-22 20:10:39 You actually asked a question I will answer: ,always support military including John McCain a great American. No one likes taxes. High capacity magazine s and bump stocks no. Armour piercing rounds only for law enforcement and military. Can't do abortion . Tax bill screwed me
477 2018-01-22 20:10:38 I'm not saving anything on my taxes. The mandate came from Romney Care in Massachusetts (Heritage Foundation) and enforces personal responsibility. The stock market is in a bubble of a few, select stocks and the U.S. funds ISIS. I couldn't care less if Jerusalem is the capital.
478 2018-01-22 20:09:56 Stocks are thriving with fewer regulations that protect Americans health and money. They are allowed to run amuck at our expense

487 2018-01-22 20:05:14 I am just observing that the tech stocks are driving s&p and they are growing free cash flows faster than before off a higher yield than the treasury market.

491 2018-01-22 20:03:54 I have been getting some DM's asking me the same question. Where do I feel bitcoin or some other specific crypto altcoin will be going?

My standard response is , "Up & Down and trade them with proper risk mgmt (like you do with stocks) along the way to making money"
492 2018-01-22 20:03:46 Je pense que c'est une solution facile pour écouler des stocks.......
493 2018-01-22 20:03:14 I know the difference. Bump stocks made a semi-automatic rifle fire like a full automatic. It may fire at a slightly slower rate, but very close. I also know M-1A's, had to carry one in boot camp. 9lbs. if I remember right.
494 2018-01-22 20:03:09 Are you of the opinion that stocks have reached a permanently high plateau?
495 2018-01-22 20:03:04 I have one store near my PT that stocks it at retail- 1 bottle limit
496 2018-01-22 20:02:56 If your friends aren’t telling you about bitcoin, stocks, and shit. They don’t want you to have money 

If your friends aren’t telling you about awesome food places to eat at. They don’t want you to eat

497 2018-01-22 20:02:36 That's when I expect the US weed market to turn over, b/c obviously I don't think we are done here barring a raid of a state-legal biz.

498 2018-01-22 20:02:14 ISoE is the classic; I liked Chaos cuz of its timing (came out fall 1987). 
You prolly have an answer to this:
If you had invested $1,000 in 1982 pegged to the stocks profiled in Excellence, what would be the value now? More than a 4% bond ($4,100) or simple inflation ($2,600)?
499 2018-01-22 20:01:28 So it’s a blizzard right? And everyone usually stocks up on snacks and food before it hits. Well get this... Dustin and I don’t because we do that stuff DURING the blizzard. We’re really smart and always prepared

506 2018-01-22 19:58:34 Bump stocks made them essentially automatic. You can still legally get "bump stocks". They may not be legally called automatic weapons, but their rate of fire is close. Don't think the victims of Vegas give a shit which type of gun killed them.
507 2018-01-22 19:58:30 I agree with sentiment but unfortunately this hurts small businesses like mine. I live week to week on my sales...well below median  income. A month of no sales might land me on the street. I have no stocks or investments to shelter me. Many people like me.

519 2018-01-22 19:52:24 Really its a pattern the stock follows. All stocks trade on a pattern. If you can find that pattern and recognize it. This is what you get. I should say alot of stocks and not all. People asking about vwap. Stock market is unpredictable so vwap is good to know but dont need
520 2018-01-22 19:52:11 25pct s&p is Tech stocks. Google is just one example.

527 2018-01-22 19:49:06 Remember if you want to play $NFLX the cheap way then buy the other FANG stocks. If this runs tomorrow they will run with it and they are def priced less expensive via options. Just a thought.
528 2018-01-22 19:47:45 Kat the popular vote doesn’t make you president, I want a wall to keep illegals out of our country. If you want to come here do with the right way that’s why we have laws. Look at the economy is booming 401(k) stocks, all doing good.
529 2018-01-22 19:47:22 If you called crypto currencies penny stocks and showed the same graphs everyone would have called them dog shit, call it an internet currency and everyone fought to give you more money than the next guy
530 2018-01-22 19:45:32 Nope. I would only invest in stocks to watch my money flip gotta make sure my kids are set and straight in the future

532 2018-01-22 19:45:04 Wow, pardon my grammar. Let me rephrase that and add a little more: I prefer to call it promoting Andrew. I promote a few stocks but it’s based on solid DD. Pumpers tend to voice unrealistic share price expectations and Sx was a prime example of that.
533 2018-01-22 19:44:47 No bond market jitters yet. Stocks up again. But it's worth noting that the yield on the 10-Year U.S. Treasury is now 2.66% -- the highest level since July 2014. If that keeps climbing and tops 3%, there could be trouble.
534 2018-01-22 19:44:36 They were down until noon when Schumer waved the white flag! Then stocks went up

537 2018-01-22 19:41:12 I think a lot of people are scared right now. But they are scared of prices, the company has released no negative news. There will be more wild swings up and down in the future I believe. Based on trading data, Blockchain stocks get a ton of excitement from investors.

558 2018-01-22 19:27:08 Interresting take you have. I wish I could believe it, but considering how over-valued stocks are at the moment based upon asset value to outstanding shares, I can't imagine how much more inflated it could go before it snaps back. Fundamentals have a long way to go to catch up.

658 2018-01-22 18:33:26 stocks, boxing, and more water 2018
659 2018-01-22 18:33:20 Stocks increased but NEVER as fast as this last tear! O sent businesses overseas, lots of success in getting a record number on welfare and M’Cade! The liberal measure of success!!!
660 2018-01-22 18:32:29 Up and down trends (channels) in stocks and stock indexes are at a certain angle.  If the angle in the trend increases to exceed 45% it is usually unsustainable with a reverse in price back into the channel very possible
661 2018-01-22 18:31:54 Ordinary currencies and stocks don't have coordinated govt. actions against them. Even with all that, Bitcoin is holding a price above $10k.
662 2018-01-22 18:31:32 Till the time you use alts in everyday life, they should be treated as stocks, meaning count your profit in fiat.
663 2018-01-22 18:31:06 @paytmbankcare The Date mentioned in the app for my Debit Card delivery is 30th January, would my card be actually be delivered by that date or is it just an assumption depending on the stocks and availability?
664 2018-01-22 18:28:40 A pre sale ico opportunity that others are not privy to is very close to being paid imo... if it were stocks it would be close to insider type trades....
That said- you help others way more than hurt anyone for sure.

669 2018-01-22 18:25:36 Anecdotally, the tech works. I started doing bank & real estate conference calls in summer of '08. I told my boss that he should start telling clients to short the fuck out of bank stocks. My boss didn't listen.

675 2018-01-22 18:22:56 Yes! This is out of control, when will the people’s voice be heard and broadcast? Money out of politics now! Did Dems cave because they’re afraid their Wall Street donors will be upset if stocks go down! Idiots all! #EndCitizensUnited

679 2018-01-22 18:18:18 We have kiwisaver here in New Zealand we put in 4% of our wages or up 8% and the employer puts 4% and the money is invested in stocks and shares properly managed funds. Not a good idea to put all your money in one company.
680 2018-01-22 18:17:37 Funny, me too! Plowed the proceeds into some defensive dividend stocks and used the rest for cash secured put selling. I think it was the right move!
681 2018-01-22 18:16:23 And many many many many more other trash stocks! He’s not that good.
682 2018-01-22 18:16:15 Senate reaches deal to end government shutdown.  MBS edge lower as the government looks to reopen with enough Senate votes to pass a funding bill.  Stocks boosted by the Senate news.

691 2018-01-22 18:11:50 Another gentleman named Chip (didn't catch his last name) dismisses notion that herring are "gone." Speaks to stocks that have bounced back. #AKBoF
692 2018-01-22 18:11:47 Your ideal scenario is bogus and based on casino style corporate markets-little regulation -trillions of monies daily traded around the world in automated 24/7 programs that suck the small change out of the up & down movement of stocks-- producing nothing of value
693 2018-01-22 18:10:57 The $JUNO acquisition by $CELG and the $BIVV acquisition by $SNY are the two catalysts sending biotech stocks surging today. $LABU

697 2018-01-22 18:10:14 Riefenstuhl reiterates proposals would be devastating to industry, raises new points of herring stocks bouncing back from reduction fisheries in 1930s. Evidence of the good science of ADF&G. #AKBoF

702 2018-01-22 18:06:47 They are just guidelines. In weaker stocks, the pattern could be different. Firstly go for outperformers in that sector such as Gruh fin, IBHsg, Dhfl, etc. You stand a good chance of making more as Strong money Chases them. More volume, more participation, more the pattern works.

706 2018-01-22 18:02:59 "Discovery cost" for @BarrickGold ca. $25/ounce. Nice number to keep in mind when looking at exploration stocks! #VRIC18 #AMERoundup2018
707 2018-01-22 18:02:59 Sure.  The fed bought up treasury bonds, depriving excess cash a place to park in a savings account at the fed.  So that excess cash went into stocks and real estate.
708 2018-01-22 18:02:59 Ya I got into researching/investing/trading crypto + regular stocks @ the same time ~ fun and very interesting journey so far.
709 2018-01-22 18:02:35 New record highs for the stocks Why not?
The US stocks are trading at record levels with the S&P up about 15 points to 2825, the Nasdaq up 54.5 points at 7392 and the Dow at 26140 up 92 points.
710 2018-01-22 18:02:05 My stocks are booming. The stock from the company that I studied and vetted has performed the best.
711 2018-01-22 18:02:04 Stocks are boring, hodling for years to get 30% roi. Come to crypto and lose 60% in a few hours, but +1000% in a couple of months lol
712 2018-01-22 18:01:30 There is a bunch of money flowing out here get yourself a piece. #stocks #Investing #business
713 2018-01-22 18:01:19 Real estate goes up in value at 3% rate a year, stocks go up in value at an average of 9% a year. That’s 90% returns over 10 years vs 30% returns

716 2018-01-22 18:01:00 Appreciate sharing perspective.  I typically only invest in 1-3 stocks at a time in large quantities and play more from valauation standpoint.   I’m comfortable with the DD and increasing stake as this particular equity drops.   However most OTC Is agree from a trading per...

726 2018-01-22 17:57:17 Renzi is a liar. He knows that every vote for the right wing coalition is a vote pro-Eu. Cause his Masonic older twin, Berlusconi, will set all conditions in that side.

790 2018-01-22 17:27:59 This proves that money doesn't buy class or refinement. Trump is a cheap copy of a successful business person. He inherited his wealth, and has underperformed the economy consistently. According to Forbes, if Trump had simply invested in safe stocks, he would be worth 8 billion.

804 2018-01-22 17:23:13 MSM? Those are from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, daft cow. Unemployment steadily dropped under Obama, stocks increased, and our economy recovered. Trump is riding the coat tails of Obama's success, and even then it's slowing down. He's had the weakest job creation in 6 years.

806 2018-01-22 17:21:23 We also risk losing our credit rating, which will cause our interest rates to go up.

812 2018-01-22 17:18:44 People are seriously hoarding all the NBS stocks of gluey tape and I'm just........ gdi. It forces everyone else to buy them from the hoarders/scalpers who price them higher.
813 2018-01-22 17:18:37 I just bought 500000 more at .014 there is no telling how high it’s going. Like i said penny stocks don’t usually have deals with Fortune 500 companies. I would buy as much as you can and let it ride. May get crazy
814 2018-01-22 17:17:38 There was supposed to be a 4 to 1 consolidation on Jan. 18 which would explain the price per stock jump but then number of stocks would be less but I'm not seeing this.

816 2018-01-22 17:14:50 The S&P 500 is up over 5% to start the year. Will the govt shutdown slow down stocks? It has been more than a year since S&P 500 had a 5% correction and stocks are at a high valuation. However, shutdowns historically have not provided much of an impact because they are temporary.
817 2018-01-22 17:13:38 Remember when Cristal told Jay-Z that he and his ilk had cheapened the brand by pouring it on women in yachts? So he yanked them out of all of his nightclubs...and told his friends not to buy from them...and their stocks plummeted?
818 2018-01-22 17:13:31 I look at stocks similar to poker in ways. Sometimes you make good call & have some bad luck. I always say don’t be emotional, poker is a game that can suck you in the same way a stock can. It’s important to step back sometimes before you lose all your chips from emotional plays.

916 2018-01-22 16:29:32 Higher inflation may also impact stock performance.  We just saw the yield on the 10-year reach a level it hadn't seen since 2014.  How will stocks react if that yield exceeds 3%?

923 2018-01-22 16:26:05 Stocks higher. Tech in rally mode as earnings kick off today. Netflix up a half dozen on hope of a big sub add. Markets don’t care about a government shut down as the gov does more harm than good. Tax reform is done. So who needs hem anymore. $nflx
924 2018-01-22 16:26:02 The federal government has been #shutdown since Friday night. Stocks however have been resilient with little selling taking place.

927 2018-01-22 16:24:48 I shorted the shares of $GALT and bought puts as well. Often puts gave me much better return, but the timing is the issue.  stock has durable stamina.  To avoid paying too much premium, I mainly short stocks, and buy near term (1-2 month) puts that will rolled down if expire
928 2018-01-22 16:24:43 Especially when young, I'd leave stocks and shares to grow by themselves and focus on developing several marketable skills and have a side gig as a consultant. Also, if possible, being an airbnb host also works well with someone who just started out on the FI path

936 2018-01-22 16:21:45 Buy value and you can't go wrong. The best stocks are those that no one wants to know about. They sit like dormant volcanoes, it's only a matter of time till they erupt. Few players have the patience to accumulate and hold.
937 2018-01-22 16:21:04 worst thing you can do when you go to the track is to look at the odds board before you look at the program and handicap the race yourself; same is true for stocks; don't let stock price or recent moves sway you into thinking you are missing something; long or short

944 2018-01-22 16:17:59 As Wayne Gretzky would say, skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it is.

A major component for the movements in stocks is the availability, or lack there of, of a higher yielding asset.  With 0% rates, stocks it is.  When bonds start paying, money flow will change
945 2018-01-22 16:17:38 Thanks. Indeed, there are many rules of thumbs in portfolio construction that most don't critically assess. Playing it safe in stocks (dividend-paying, low-vol, etc.) and being risky in bonds just makes no sense. If you look at the numbers, you need to do the opposite.

1040 2018-01-22 15:19:45 Oh wow, Nice to see FP have their stocks up for a change.
1041 2018-01-22 15:17:50 With characters like Bayo killing super early it's probably time to finally consider 3 stocks or early bo5 in bracket
1042 2018-01-22 15:17:42 Weed stocks getting a little weaker as morning drags.
1043 2018-01-22 15:16:32 Hi, I have been day trading stocks with the Mojo Chat Room for 5 Years now and it's very profitable. I have learned how to make money everyday and it's not hard. I feel comfortable telling others now as I know this works for me and it can for you. DM for link...
1044 2018-01-22 15:16:23 @realDonaldTrump Dear sir, please even look at the Stock Market.  Every time it is mentioned on the news that the Republicans may give some on immigration, stocks drop?  Make no mistake, this is the #SchumerShutdown
1045 2018-01-22 15:15:41 I only trade stocks. Wife would divorce me if I played options. Doesn't think I'm lucky enough.
1046 2018-01-22 15:15:17 Another great day on the stock market. The stocks been good to a brother these last 3 months
1047 2018-01-22 15:14:58 As much as I love the Cannabis sector there are few others stocks that have been long term holds and have turned into ten plus baggers. $PHO blew through $2 this am, I see them as a takeover target in the $3-4 range Love it. #weed #acb
1048 2018-01-22 15:14:13 If the stocks you own didn't go up 5% (or God forbid actually went red) after today's $20B deals  , is it time kiss the BO dream goodbye? Asking for a friend...
1049 2018-01-22 15:14:04 A low GDP is bullish a shut down is buliish  just look at stocks since open ??? @no_pullbacks
1050 2018-01-22 15:14:03 Goldman Sachs’ private wealth management advisors are telling its wealthiest clients that stocks are not in a bubble and that the bull market likely continues.
1051 2018-01-22 15:13:54 Jesus, Mary and Joseph. Racist? What’s that all about. You know, I gotta hand it to you old self-loathing white people. You really are quite the conundrum. Oh-well L, Trump is president, Hillary’s investigations on track... and my stocks look good... all is right in th world.
1052 2018-01-22 15:13:09  apparently bottom feeding off food stamps & welfare hasn’t been good for you. Those of us that have 401 k’s, stocks, small businesses, etc. you know the American dream, are doing way better than we were with the dead economy of the Obama administration.

1059 2018-01-22 15:09:51 "#Stocks set to open lower..." ya...not $NFLX , chugging higher into earnings today. #Netflix posts widely-followed media trend numbers which will flow-through to opinions of others like $DIS. Kind of like the $AMZN of broadcasting.
1060 2018-01-22 15:09:32 True...but my nvidia stocks are no joke
1061 2018-01-22 15:09:25 When stocks are bought, companies usually back it up with what they call options.. they trade the options but the options are backed up with the OWNERSHIP of their stock. Buying and selling on a exchange platform just like you do crypto is no diff. Ripple can IPO if they want to.
1062 2018-01-22 15:08:38 Mentions recent @amazon purchase of @whole

1069 2018-01-22 15:06:13 Larry Summers was talking on Bloomberg today about 10 yr dropping to 1.5 in next recession. It was at 1.4 in the summer w/o a recession on high stocks/low VIX. Gold hasn't died like all the obituaries being written. VIX is up 40% from recent low and 10 yr is up 80% from 16 low
1070 2018-01-22 15:05:50 If you want to know where equities are headed you should watch equities. This fascination with the 10-year and what it means for stocks is getting bizarre.

1075 2018-01-22 15:04:00 I no longer trade in traditional stocks as I do believe in JOHN MCAFEE: crypto will be the future once regulated; for now it is still a great way to make quick money if you are on the calm and can pragmatically anticipate the swings

@SRuhle
1096 2018-01-22 14:57:31 US stocks rise BECAUSE of the #shutdown.
Because now we can HOPE that the #shutdown soon will end 
1097 2018-01-22 14:57:08 US stocks are taking the shutdown in stride. Little changed in early trade. The major indices are mixed
The US stocks are open and the first 15 minutes are showing that they are taking the government shut down in stride.  The major indices are mixed:

1101 2018-01-22 14:53:24 Terrible presentation. I would be upset too even if it seems super trivial. They probably don't have enough silver in their stocks which means the place isn't doing very well. The cracks are showing.

1138 2018-01-22 14:39:52 Agreed. Boom in stocks is driven by relative devaluation of the dollar over the past 12 months...$ is 13% down against € and DXY is under 90 for the first time in 5 years.

1156 2018-01-22 14:33:40 The “experts” ask y the economy is so good & Trump’s approval so bad. I’m no expert, but my opinion: Most of the populace has no stocks or investments, and don’t like Trump. Their ecomomy is  static or bad. The big stock gains r for the small % of the population that likes Trump.

1184 2018-01-22 14:19:35 You’re right. I made a bad assumption and thought he was talking to you. And that was not to say that you don’t own stocks but more that someone near or at retirement age can be completely short sighted by thinking that others are in their financial position.

1186 2018-01-22 14:19:17 The “experts” ask y the economy is so good & Trump’s approval so bad. I’m no expert, but my opinion: Most of the populace has no stocks or investments, and don’t like Trump. Their ecomomy is  static or bad. The big stock gains r for the small % of the population that likes Trump.

1193 2018-01-22 14:17:08 Hey William. Not at all. When RSI (the pink chart in my screen shot) is over 70 it’s considered overbought. The stock can still increase while overbought (the strongest stocks do for weeks). It’s just good at indicating when one should be more cautious of taking a position.

1212 2018-01-22 14:09:06 So I'm thinking TA works on stocks what 65% of the time ? I'm thinking crypto it's like 50% of the time maybe less. There seems to be way more variables at play in the crypto world.
1213 2018-01-22 14:08:36 we're in a nothing makes any sense anymore mode. Larry Summers was talking today about the next recession taking the 10 yr down to 1.5. Heck it was at 1.4 in the summer on no recession, just high stocks & a low VIX at that time w/ a yield below LS forecast for the next recession.
1214 2018-01-22 14:08:27 Stocks were undercut by the prospects for a U.S. government shutdown and by the unexpected -1.5 point decline in the University of Michigan U.S. Jan consumer sentiment index to a 6-month low of 94.4 (weaker than expectations of +1.1 to 97.0).

1275 2018-01-22 13:39:06 They make their money from mass volume (multiple reselling of the same ticket). So I’d imagine that marque events like this are a huge cash cow due to ticket brokers buying and selling them like stocks.

1299 2018-01-22 13:25:30 I can say with near certainty that stocks (global ETF) will not drop 50% in the next couple of years. I would put a significant likelihood on Cryptos going below 10% though.
1300 2018-01-22 13:23:39 While Ponzi isn't appropriate here, stocks represent legal ownership and rights to cash flow. There's ways to monetize shares without reselling on the open market (dividends/LBO). If AAPL shares stopped public trading, its equity value wouldn't become worthless.

If you're an investor (if there's such a thing for gold) can use 41.50. SGL: Could probably stretch stop to a close below R14.75...../2

1416 2018-01-22 11:48:44 Structural edge in all investing. Imagine having the capital to put $10,000 in 50 tech stocks twenty years ago. 40 fail, 9 net neutral, just 1 is Apple at $0.70/share.

$2.5M. Not including all the splits along the way. Easily covers losses and then some.

1418 2018-01-22 11:44:54 Expect 2 see volatility in resource stocks, especially in exploration & Jr miners... SQM should b making new highs on the news, it gets played as well.  But last 2 years no doubt a great run.

We expect the JSE to open lower today (-0.3%) on account of the stronger rand over the weekend. The appointment of a new Eskom board has supported positive investor sentiment towards the ZAR.

1751 2018-01-22 06:22:20 stocks should never be relied on as a form of income. Investing should always be a side hustle.
1752 2018-01-22 06:22:00 If demand for U.S. fixed income doesn’t double over the coming years then U.S. long rates will move higher, credit spreads will widen, the dollar will fall, and stocks will likely go down as foreigners move out of depreciating U.S. assets. 
1753 2018-01-22 06:21:40 It's actually VERY illogical considering someone can come in and dump in 2 seconds or buy in 2 seconds and trigger bots to cause massive buys or sell walls. If this was stocks i would agree with his charts, BUT IT'S NOT. Look at #TRX right now as a prime example prior his tweet

Hay Jim, Love Your Show & humor..

I see Stock-Pricing is decided by 2 main Factors.. [Actual Value vs ppl interest] But 1 is EATING UP the other unfairly.. 
Q: is their Numbers or Tools that can be [RE]used to determine a stocks price?

1851 2018-01-22 05:04:13 We see the same thing, but In a bullish environment stock that want to go don’t pay much attention to indexes action. So as long as pulls are orderly, I focus on the behavior of the stocks. Hope that makes sense.

1901 2018-01-22 04:28:54 Investors overweight in high dividend Australian stocks should consider reducing such exposure, and instead upping freed up investment capital towards global investments, particularly select niche assets, and domestically small cap strategies with proven track records.
1902 2018-01-22 04:28:30 Delving into the rationale.  A lower corporate tax rate will reduce the amount of dividends received.  A cut/removal in imputation credits will impact after tax returns.  Many of these stocks, ie AUS Banks, are low growth due to poor utilisation of capital vs the ASX 200.
1903 2018-01-22 04:28:28 See for me I think everything in the game is fine as is, yeah I get it seems that way but like there is definitely counter play, I know some people are like "Bleh she can take stocks at 30" but like. .

1921 2018-01-22 04:13:31 There is always a reason why stocks go up or down, we usually only learn the reason when it is too late.

1971 2018-01-22 03:40:32 Trump fixed the economy, 2 million+ jobs, record high stocks, millions saved from illegals, funds invested in helping the ignored/neglected Veterans. Considering everything he's done so far, fulfilled alot of promises, you'd think people would be grateful & stop whining.

President Trump just hates America that is why the economy is booming, people are getting raises, we all get TAX Breaks, Black unemployment is lowest ever, women's unemployment is lowest in 17 years, stocks over 26,000. Yea, hates. MAGA.

2048 2018-01-22 02:56:38 I'm sure your stocks have made a killing this last year thanks to @realDonaldTrump  You #DelusionalDemocrats have lost your minds. 70% country with him 
2049 2018-01-22 02:56:19 Why do you never see him in front of a display of any kind? Not even to watch his stocks. Odd.
2050 2018-01-22 02:56:05 Yes thank you I am having a wonderful life here on earth and it got much better a year ago when President Trump took office! My stocks and investments are having a blast too! God bless!
2051 2018-01-22 02:55:59 You nailed it Max. I actually think these stocks are cheap because there is too much risk priced in.
2052 2018-01-22 02:55:50 $aaz otherwise you’re gonna end up with the wrong company  also $por , $ngz (two lithium stocks) and $uav if you don’t already know about them!

2055 2018-01-22 02:54:19 The last #USshutdown in Oct 2013 had no major impact on the market. In fact stocks kept rallying much beyond. Now there are earnings & liquidity to support. History to repeat itself? Seems more a question of when they can seal the deal rather than when

2065 2018-01-22 02:49:16 Lots of stocks struggling today.

That's a good sign for the rest of the year . We don't want too much bullishness if a correction takes hold . We want a clean out so we can then clean up

2078 2018-01-22 02:36:25 GOA might have been a better example. NRA is up to shady stuff nowdays. Complicity on banning bump stocks could be interpreted as banning semiautos all together.
2079 2018-01-22 02:34:27 Underexplored only because junk bonds are still under-ETF’d - in many cases, the ETFs still have more liquidity and price transparency than the bonds, but many bonds themselves are still less accessible than most micro-cap stocks

2082 2018-01-22 02:30:19 The two safest weed stocks imo are mmj and Mym I believe both will get contracts with the Quebec gov’t
2083 2018-01-22 02:30:15 they will also go after stocks that are being over promoted, either by ceos, social media or the like....sx was the perfect storm because they had it all over promotion, way over BV...hindsight now it was probably looking way too easy and essentially it was

2100 2018-01-22 02:17:42 well it was from a friend whose dad owns their own wealth firm.. i didnt get into detail but he was trying to tell me to buy into potstocks that are directly involved with gov't legislation, as there are a lot of big funds that are eyeing opportunities to short vulnerable stocks
2101 2018-01-22 02:17:11 PS - The CEO of MGM sold 80% of his shares right before the massacre. These are solid, profitable stocks. Soros purchased $42M in puts 30 days before the assault. These are very strange transactions right before a massacre - just don't make sense unless they knew #SaudiAndClinton

2105 2018-01-22 02:11:41 Do you understand how percentages work? Do you understand how much the Dow increased w/ Obama from his start? Do you understand how stocks != wages, which are still stagnant?

Do you remember how the last thing that happened before the last recession was a runaway stock market?

Actually I will do both. Buying today, tomorrow and leave some in the kitty for later in the week.

2121 2018-01-22 02:01:46 Makes sense.  Cheap stocks can remain cheap and frustrate you.  Understanding markets helps greatly in better entry and exit decisions.
2122 2018-01-22 02:01:33 For car, we at least take car insurance. What is the equivalent in stocks? Having big factor of safely while buying?
2123 2018-01-22 02:01:30 I watched months of football just to see my Giants become one of the laughing stocks of the NFL, and followed that up with the worst possible Super Bowl matchup that could have come out of today. 

I don't even want to watch the Super Bowl at this point. I'm 200% done.
2124 2018-01-22 02:01:07 Just did it. Bump stocks are not the problem. Insanity and criminal behavior are the problems. Try to solve problems like those...not write more law. No one pays attention to laws unless they want to and are relatively normal.

 Please advise on DIry stocks for long-term. I want to bet on Dairy and liquor (doodh, daru) as their consumption will always grow.

I am holding 20 shares of Shee la Foams @1500.  Want to buy more. Please advise.
2128 2018-01-22 01:58:22 This show how far out of touch you are! The increase in stocks benefits the few wealthy at the top..the average American, this does nothing for. And how dare you use your racist platform by trying to tie this to migrants!
2129 2018-01-22 01:58:19 My Crypto group wants Salt to win.....many in our group hold Salt tokens. My job was to learn more about its leadership...same work I did evaluating which stocks I would buy. Due diligence. Let us know about Mr King please. Thank you.

2136 2018-01-22 01:53:56 When day trading, I like to target 2 or 3 stocks. Take the day of the week into account, time of day, holidays, be calm, and don't ever buy when prices are rallying up. Don't make emotional plays. If you miss an opportunity, don't beat yourself up. Realize it, and learn from it.

2141 2018-01-22 01:49:58 Makes sense. In traditional stocks and assets I mostly use it for weekly timeframes.
2142 2018-01-22 01:49:08 I was telling you about my book when the bullet hits the bone its my life story another story in my book is about the counterfit stock scam where counterfit stocks from the Vatican in rome Italy were brought to the united states
2143 2018-01-22 01:49:02 No. Hundreds wounded. I believe 58 killed. There are no gun control laws that would have prevented that madman from killing. Obama admin approved bumb stocks, which NRA asked to ban. Don't conflate issues. Illegals kill. Tell that to grieving families.
2144 2018-01-22 01:48:31 As a conservative, I don’t have a problem getting rid of bump stocks.

2147 2018-01-22 01:47:35 not to sound like a whole foods mom but sometimes i think about how processed and capitalist food is here in america like.........food = stocks = money and that's all ppl care about instead of making decent food that isn't just an imitation of food
2148 2018-01-22 01:45:20 But please... try and pretend you’re Gordon Gekko and show us some stocks, as if anyone cares or is impressed (still laughing you actually did that. Hahahaha). You’re a shallow, empty headed clown, who’s purpose is strictly to be ridiculed and mocked. YOU are a punchline.
2149 2018-01-22 01:45:01 Yes, but only those stocks you think are way ahead of themselves. If you are a long term investor, you shouldn’t try to time the market.

2158 2018-01-22 01:33:22 Nigerian Army? Cattle rearing? What is happening in this country? Why are we bent on making ourselves laughing stocks before the world? The govt is now fronting the army to create the cattle colony because they feel the army can not be challanged. Shame!
2159 2018-01-22 01:33:16 Watching Smash 4 has just become an exercise in frustration at this point. I doubt anyone cares for my opinion, but Bayo's design is beyond stupid for the reward she gains in advantage. We shouldn't be fearing for the opponent more when a Bayo is down by 150% on final stocks.
2160 2018-01-22 01:32:19 If US shale production was really about to surge again, then the oil drilling & service stocks would be performing better (along w/their fin results) which hasn't been the case.

2181 2018-01-22 01:14:24 kalo nonton series BILLIONS, lo akan sadar hidup kita ditentukan sama stocks trading (entah kalo di indo). Karena mereka decide based on regulator or decision maker di pemerintahan. Dan di antara mereka punya akses buat saling tukar informasi sebelum official public announcement

2187 2018-01-22 01:06:27 Dd is what counts and I am always on stock house Twitter getting ideas about other stocks and doing the best dd I can. That all any person can do. Knowbody is perfect. You win some u lose some it's the markets . In the end there is always someone that will lose.
2188 2018-01-22 01:05:52 Stocks and bonds are already taxed. It’s called capital gains tax, and increasing it would be a bad move for several reasons. Keep in mind, all people’s retirement accounts are made up of stocks and bonds. It would effectively further raise the tax on everybody.
2189 2018-01-22 01:05:20 3. The stocks are up,can’t dispute that. The unemployment is at all time low for people of color,fact. The unemployment for women@all time low,fact,just look at Trumps cabinet. Taxes cut,fact.Veterans waiting to be seen was several hundred thousand, now at 80 or 90thousand...

2196 2018-01-22 00:56:29 How is this guy still allowed face-time to promote his negativity.......on Foxbiz in 2015-16 he was talking down stocks as too risky due to "artificially low rates by the Fed"......DOW was 16,000 then..... 26,000 today......sadly he's been SO wrong for So long....unbelievable
2197 2018-01-22 00:55:43 Gold & mining stocks are a trading vehicle unless anyone's time frame is 100 years.   :)
2198 2018-01-22 00:54:19 How many in GOP and their donors have shorted stocks for Monday opening?

2202 2018-01-22 00:50:27 Yeah. Just adjustable stocks. This is such a shitshow and so infuriating. Only you and a few others really care to get the truth out.

2207 2018-01-22 00:43:29 That is not the economy; its just the markets. The economy relies on a lot more than just stocks.

2209 2018-01-22 00:39:59 80% of americans will get more money.  Record bonuses and stocks given to employees.  Yep what a horrible thing
2210 2018-01-22 00:39:50 Why would anyone be joint possession or have common property in money or stocks? You do that with lands, etc. not with money. You get your money and buy the stocks or have them transferred, not 'jointly share' some divisible thing unless you happen to be partners in crime.
2211 2018-01-22 00:38:18 Asian stocks looked set to open higher as investors kept an eye on the U.S. after a government shutdown began.

2215 2018-01-22 00:32:48 Scare tactics to the Trump supporters. I wonder what twitter would do if 677,775 users disabled their accounts all at the same time? Twitter stocks would take a #MEGA dip.
2216 2018-01-22 00:31:38 We're in agreement, then:  Public stocks punishment for material bad actors of either political party.
2217 2018-01-22 00:30:49 This whole thing will blow up. Invest in blue chip stocks and not this scam.
2218 2018-01-22 00:30:34 @cryptopicasso Hello! Why in your analyses you make so much intense about close of the candles? Iit matters in stocks and forex, where market is closed daily, but in crypto it is just point in time?
2219 2018-01-22 00:30:26 How wonderful would that be Yes-seems so wrong they get paid for their Evil gift to America, I can’t help but wonder why do they hate us Americans, Babies, Stock Market Boom, New Jobs, Tax Cuts, they have plenty money getting bigger in Stocks, a life time Job?
2220 2018-01-22 00:30:18 trump Then: "Stocks rose yesterday during the first day of government shutdown. Markets like being left alone for a day." (Via Twitter, Oct. 2, 2013)

2229 2018-01-22 00:21:13 Strong implications for asset allocation if growth is higher - sell #bonds and hold stocks; keep credit exposure and buy #commodities.
2230 2018-01-22 00:21:13 It's all too clear. Trumptards do not see reality, or are you Russian?
But let's keep Bump Stocks around, because the NRA and Russia have Americas interest in their hearts. #TrumpShutdown
2231 2018-01-22 00:20:43 Rumor has it VU stocks the bus with alcohol so we can celebrate our test being done (or drink away our sorrows) #poppinbottleseitherway
2232 2018-01-22 00:20:26 US stocks rose on Friday, with both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq ending at records as optimism over corporate earnings outweighed the threat of a government shutdown.

2237 2018-01-22 00:15:54 Everything is not regulated, so watch out for your stocks, they can fall as fast as they went up,actually they went higher for obama in his first year!
2238 2018-01-22 00:13:43 Buy stocks!!
2239 2018-01-22 00:13:06 I love your predictions, what will you say tommorow if stocks open and they're up? Nothing, I'm sure! Polls said Clinton was going to be our president. Not.
2240 2018-01-22 00:12:52 I’m convinced the Krafts must own stocks in anxiety meds.
2241 2018-01-22 00:12:24 Doesn't really make sense to me Japanese #Stocks for example would be suffering "more" than U.S. #Stocks tonight... The uncertainty right now is regarding #US Government #TrumpShutdown. *The #Nikkei 225 $NKD_F is -90 points -.38%, while the #Dow $YM_F only down -48 points -.18%!?
2242 2018-01-22 00:11:50 If you own stocks, maybe you are doing better.  If you have to go to the grocery store and buy food; if you have to buy anything, your paycheck is shrinking.
2243 2018-01-22 00:11:35 Some personal indicators I use when looking at stocks:

- PE Ratio
- Revenue Growth
- Total Cash
- Total Debt
- Growth prospects

2245 2018-01-22 00:04:15 I though it was everyone who foolishly pulled out of stocks in 2016. Only reason I can see to be upset.
