41 2018-08-14 23:37:00 That's like saying stocks will never go down if average daily volume is 4% of an equity. The marginal buyer/seller dictate the price. And if that 4% demand goes down then price goes down and that 96% will feel less wealthy
42 2018-08-14 23:36:40 invest in stocks my ass
43 2018-08-14 23:36:04 Thank you! Yes it’s been a crazy streak so far, but mentally prepared for the inevitable red day lol. I find my own stocks to trade now for the most part, but def applying the same principles. Just keep studying and growing and it’ll start coming together!

47 2018-08-14 23:33:08 $GTEC.v hit today along with the rest of MJ stocks after the Ontario cannabis retail delay until April 2019. Definitely not great news, but for $GTEC, whose ops are in Western Canada, this broad sell-off is a #BTFD opportunity. That is exactly what the US was doing today...
48 2018-08-14 23:32:04 It’s a long hold ...
It will take a while but worth it later on just be patience .. result will be fruitful.  1400 shares on hold. Hopefully in a month or two month will start seeing the gains #stocks #PENNYSTOCKS #moviepass

50 2018-08-14 23:29:43 Pay off school and car loans, and then probably invest $200mil of it into stocks and bonds that pay back an average of 4%/year in dividends so that I could have about an $8mil/year income for the rest of my life. Reinvest some of that and then chill with the remaining $100mil.

52 2018-08-14 23:28:48 So I was planning a vacation and had a nice pile of cash ready for it. Today, I decided, I will buy stocks on the cheap with that cash instead. Then people wonder why I am broke even though I claim to be an investor. Live later, invest now. Why do I do this to myself 
53 2018-08-14 23:28:17 Stocks for Strzok, not money.

You still wanna know? Lol
60 2018-08-14 23:24:34 Even if that were true (which it's not), Congrats to all of Trumps friends who own and manipulate stocks! Most Americans don't own stocks. Most Americans are stressing about gas prices, rising health care costs, inflation and stagnant wages.

65 2018-08-14 23:19:21 Commodity stocks have thr highest inflation bets over 2+ year periods. If you think inflation will he short lived < 2 years, then buy TIPS.  Will post chart later when I am back in at computer.
66 2018-08-14 23:18:04 in order for exchanges to see their power decreased, people need to start using cryptocurrencies as actual currencies. now, crypto more closely resembles stocks than actual money. next time you go to you favorite store, ask them if they accept $BTC or you favorite coin, like $VTC
67 2018-08-14 23:16:48 Also learning and investing in stocks

74 2018-08-14 23:13:31 Now the tax cut benefit timeline changes to "in the years ahead." How many years ahead until this "tax magic" works? Corporate titans didn't give raises, they bought back stocks, benefiting themselves and wealthy shareholders. Trickle down never benefited workers, never will.
75 2018-08-14 23:13:17 Cleaned about 8 listed stocks off my watch list. Most I followed for nostalgia. Want to go from 56 to 35ish and then add back to get to 50. Means I need to find 15 more companies to follow with great growth and clean balance sheets, regardless of valuation.
76 2018-08-14 23:13:16 Just like buying stocks on a short term and getting profits from it.
77 2018-08-14 23:12:34 I surmised that since he used it for people getting fired, it might be based on the term used for stocks viewed as "chronic underperformers". Dog stocks...

81 2018-08-14 23:09:30 Well yeah why wouldn't he? The increase in artificially gay frogs decreases the value of genuinely gay frogs due to "Hyper-Gay Inflation". All of the stocks and assets stored in frog gayness is now practically worthless. It's basic economics man.
82 2018-08-14 23:08:56 sur M6 ce midi ils ont dis qu'ils ont en fabriquer 8 millions mais comme il préfére faire du business ils attendent d'avoir écoulé les stocks des maillots 1 étoile, et ils font exprès d'en mettre une si "petite" quantité pour créer l’engouement

85 2018-08-14 23:08:11 In regards to the stocks I think due to the earnings, consistency, and with a healthy hold after the trade war is over these stocks will produce the numbers that are reflective of their earnings $huya $iq $bzun
86 2018-08-14 23:07:44 From Cup to hobby stocks, if we slowed everything down about 10% the racing would be tremendously better and noticeably cheaper.
87 2018-08-14 23:05:25 This year, the lira has lost more than 70% of its value, while bank stocks in the Stoxx Europe 600 index SXXP, +0.00% have tumbled 11%
88 2018-08-14 23:05:11 You own a lot of stocks but not $VFF it might be a diversifier to look at, up nicely today on an awful tape for the sector

90 2018-08-14 23:04:37 Didn’t update today sold out $bzun only made a little bit. With the trade war it should be noted all Chinese stocks will be shorted.
91 2018-08-14 23:04:25 Bitcoin is a gamble - you can’t guarantee a good outcome for bitcoin, buying any shares, stocks is a gamble, any company has the potential to go bust...

96 2018-08-14 23:00:14 Or, they buy stocks on news that billionaires bought the same stock 2 months ago for 10% less...
97 2018-08-14 22:59:56 Baba$ . I'm getting killed in this one. China stocks r In absolute free fall. Been so oversold for a while but showing no bottom In sight. But now a lot of #china names breaking down thru key support ! $iq $huya it's almost as if China recession is on the horizon. alot of fear rn
98 2018-08-14 22:59:13 The republicans are NOT for the working people wages aren’t keeping up, hows your healthcare working for you. The only ones doing good are the corporations and most of them are buying their own stocks not trickling down to the workers. How’s your property tax this year
99 2018-08-14 22:59:03 Idk if you’re saying you are on sub donations or you wanna buy something spend all the money like item stuff merch or stocks or something
100 2018-08-14 22:58:52 The problem with the earnings is the are only allowed to sell to a small amount of people. Once it is Legalized fully on Oct 17th the game changes for the Pot stocks. Without the gain on their Biological Assets they have a loss of $124 million, which is where i would place it.
101 2018-08-14 22:58:02 I still like the most aggressive growth stocks and ETF’s around! 
Win it all and lose it all!’n
102 2018-08-14 22:56:54 Maybe we should have theme parks for gun enthusiasts to do all the "shock & awe" shooting they want.
Allowing bump stocks/AR-15s to be available to one & all if they serve no useful societal purpose simultaneously putting citizens at risk seems foolish at best, murderous at worst
103 2018-08-14 22:55:23 These are the 5 stocks in finance sector that yesterday marked all-time highs:

104 2018-08-14 22:55:13 $MJ (largest marijuana ETF) down again (-4%) to a multi month low.
Avoid pot stocks, imho.
105 2018-08-14 22:55:10 @jimcramer Great show Jim.  But I heard two things tonight. Housing /autos bad, treasuries going up which reduces the 10 yr and should be good for stocks.  Is that right?
106 2018-08-14 22:52:36 But only for certain stocks that have to meet certain criteria for me to like it enough to do so...  1st of all, the moving averages I pack support at have to be uptrending...  And I have to like the company - then I will play the fundamentals a bit more heavily...
107 2018-08-14 22:50:08 remember when 500 people were shot dead in Las Vegas and Trump said he would ban bump stocks....
108 2018-08-14 22:50:04 If you take seriously one advice of JP Morgan, you deserve to get rekt buying their ETFs. I'm starting to reduce my positions on some stocks because i can feel how inflated it is rn.

112 2018-08-14 22:47:27 In US it doesnt matter. Every buy or sell is a taxable event. Just like stocks. Even if he sold to btc, it is taxed at the usd equivalent. He probably only has to pay long term capital gains of around 20% (depends on his State) since he probably held $ltc over a year.
113 2018-08-14 22:46:25 If we broke up most of the big meat packers, financial institutions, tech, media etc — it would be a welfare play for a whole bunch of aging middle managers, plus create (eventually) shareholder value (like if you keep all the bell stocks).  Gotta make things less efficient
114 2018-08-14 22:45:54 Will Crypto add pressure to the other markets and vice versa. No exact answer since markets are controlled by decisions of their investors. If the stocks prices do lower as expected will capital be transferred to crypto, maybe if we see further development + positive news
115 2018-08-14 22:45:50 $hmny I hope you “investors” learn from this!   It’s a fools game buying stocks like this especially when they R/s 250.   Then add in MM manipulation.
116 2018-08-14 22:43:33 just advisor fee.  could invest in anything on top of that mutual, hedge, private REITs, stocks etc

120 2018-08-14 22:38:31 @marketcall We want to charts for stocks being discussed.
121 2018-08-14 22:37:20 It’s always easy for them to predict after the fact. I’d like to hear them come out the day before, or even morning of, & state that Gold, Silver, Platinum, will fall today, Oil will rise, & stocks will set record highs..Amazing though, after the fact, they all have explanations
122 2018-08-14 22:37:05 It should have a public hanging. It is know to be an effective message. Also, the Stocks should make a comeback.
123 2018-08-14 22:35:51 once i get my stocks im getting out of debt and going back to school we gettin our shit together ladies!
124 2018-08-14 22:35:45 I wonder what the shareholders like @garyvee feel about this affecting their users and stocks.
125 2018-08-14 22:35:44 There’s a distinction between taxing an inheritance (when it’s over 500K) & taking a persons entire inheritance. I don’t mind ppl inheriting things from their parents; money, land, stocks, a strong disposition
A problem arises when someone inherits so much they don’t have to work

129 2018-08-14 22:33:21 Nothing new! Managing stock price! Like managing earnings! Like managing public information! So much hanky panky in Wall Street! Honesty & integrity for birds! Just shun individual stocks!
130 2018-08-14 22:31:27 Wow what a day on the markets (pot stocks) ... stick to your plan and make it happen. It’s been a crazy ride over 4 yrs. I’ll say it again, Oct can’t come soon enough!
131 2018-08-14 22:30:34 2 things:  1) keyword = FORMER CEO    2) he has a VESTED interest (his PYPL stock AND his cronies stocks at other places) to anchor to the establishment. There IS most certainly value to $BTC and its COMPETITION to PYPL.    BK has COME THRU here....NICE BK.

140 2018-08-14 22:23:19 Geesh - what happened to Turkey vanishing and taking the free world with it which was the reason stocks were down a day ago.  They must have righted the ship overnight for stocks to be up big today

144 2018-08-14 22:16:02 OTCs are not choppy at all compared to listed stocks. They trend really predictably when they are moving. I mainly look for breakouts.

146 2018-08-14 22:10:41 He can’t possibly believe any of this crap is he is writing. I was buying stocks when he was in diapers. He needs to make sure someone is watching his money for him. He is not good for his money. His money doesn’t like him.

148 2018-08-14 22:09:31 @HouseGOP HOUSE DEMS, incl Pelosi, are misleading voters by claiming only wealthy, Wall St, and big corps benefit from GOP TAX CUTS.  Public pensions are in financial distress and MUST invest in stocks (mutual funds & PE funds).  So Dems are against pension plans & mutual funds.

153 2018-08-14 22:08:23 I did, you ride out the economy. I personally know more than 1 person who benefitted from the crash. You ride out the drop and buy more stocks while they’re cheap then ride them back up. How do we ride out a full bankruptcy of the fed?

171 2018-08-14 21:59:23 It's a good time to invest in exposure right now.  Stocks are low, so you best get some while you can before they really hit big.
172 2018-08-14 21:58:35 I would say the same about crypto holders, you don't need to hold through the bear market, we need capitulation so releasing actually benefits all. See how that works? Holding gold/mining stocks in this market is just plain stupid.
173 2018-08-14 21:58:16 Makes a lot of sense. Spending is regressive and hits the poor, investing is regressive and benefits the rich. Housing is stability sought by the middle class with worse returns than risky (but on average better) stocks, risks that only the wealthy are willing to take.
174 2018-08-14 21:55:57 PM Mkts: #Corn +6; #Soybeans +11; Winter #Wheat +5. Market murmurs that the Aug yield estimate maybe the highest of the year for YC/YSB. Egypt's large wheat purchase pushs complex higher.  Ethanol production & Stocks, NOPA crush data tomorrow.

180 2018-08-14 21:50:00 I just looked at 12 rate cut cycles back to 1957. During 10, gold stocks gained a minimum of 52%, average of 185%. Start of move, avg 2.4 months after Fed Funds peak, median 1 month. Buy gold stocks after Fed's last hike!! $GDX $GDXJ $GLD
181 2018-08-14 21:49:26 I agree buy there are cost of opportunity in other stocks . Until the trade war doesn’t end we won’t see Chinese stocks going up .

190 2018-08-14 21:43:16 Don't believe me @realDonaldTrump let's look at our stocks Wall Street all the things that involve our money that you took from our families because now our families are suffering because all you do is support the 1 percent of Americans who are wealthy......
191 2018-08-14 21:42:29 Gold stocks will pay a lot more than Gold coins!
192 2018-08-14 21:42:09 What's your ytd gain%? Depending on number, I might have to dump my stocks in my portfolio and just copy yours. LoL
193 2018-08-14 21:42:08 Inflation, rising interest rates and increasing the debt will wipe out profits for workers while your one per centers buy back their own stocks. Go away spineless!
194 2018-08-14 21:41:44 I think it went down more because of technicals and traders hate Chinese stocks right now.
195 2018-08-14 21:40:15 America the country so great that haters won’t leave.
196 2018-08-14 21:40:01 Yeah agreed. I invest in stocks too, but that’s more for my pension fund so I won’t take cash out for another 40 years ish!

198 2018-08-14 21:39:19 I like the sound of that "yet"  a nice sturdy set of stocks would go great in there, with some lights to emphasise the (lucky) victim locked in them 
199 2018-08-14 21:39:06 Yeah best to invest it in stocks and shares too for better returns. (If you’ll be saving for 3+ years).
200 2018-08-14 21:37:21 Today I was thinking what I should buy myself for my bday. & honestly, stocks came to mind.
201 2018-08-14 21:37:00 US #stocks rallied on Tuesday as investor sentiment was lifted after the Turkish lira rebounded on Tuesday from a record low in the previous session.
202 2018-08-14 21:36:28 That’s ridiculous.

Everyone knows you trade stocks after the Opera ends.

203 2018-08-14 21:36:06 By the way, I didn’t say the cycle was beginning. While we are near the cycle peak, that doesn’t mean those stocks are done yet.

211 2018-08-14 21:32:39 Stocks. A share but now at 6naira like dangote sugar lasted year now this year is about 15naira over a year so imagine if left over 10years. So stocks if you invest in the right ones.
212 2018-08-14 21:31:55 I’m so glad my grandparents left me retirement money and stocks because they’re gonna take away social security money because of people like Saud.
213 2018-08-14 21:30:17 Stocks were up from lows. But they didn’t just go back to pre economy collapse #s of 12000-14000 pts. They went to record highs of 19000. Also funny how I never hear about labor participation rate anymore.
214 2018-08-14 21:29:12 I was passed out at 1 A.M. and I heard someone banging on my door I go and answer and it’s jace “he goes hey. can watch E.T.” 
215 2018-08-14 21:28:28 There has been a remarkably tepid response to FDA’s approval of 60P’s NDA for tafenoquine for prophylaxis of malaria. Even @WRAIR, @USAMMDA, and @WRAIRCTC can barely muster an argument for its use. Will @DoD_DHA permit large stocks of this drug to be wastefully purchased by DoD?
216 2018-08-14 21:28:17 Retail had a good session, with the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (NYSEMKT: XRT) jumping 2.3%. Bank stocks also rose as long-term interest rates moved up; the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (NYSEMKT: KBE) added 1.3%.

219 2018-08-14 21:27:45 You must be a 1%er. None of us regulare guys saw a cut. Unemployment is Obama's, not Trumps. Same with the stocks. Notice the stocks havent moved much since the idiot started trade wars. If anything his policies will lead us into a recession.
220 2018-08-14 21:26:52 I feel a lot of promoters don't even understand the basic things of what they are tweeting about.  I can assure you many of these pot stocks will end badly and those who fueled it wont take ownership over what they did. Im doubtful most of them even understand their role.

222 2018-08-14 21:25:36 You're Welcome! Be sure to check out my "How to Learn to invest in Stocks" @lindasstocks.com
223 2018-08-14 21:25:26 Thanks for the tip. Will have to add it to my watch-list. I only watch and trade from a few dozen stocks I know well.
224 2018-08-14 21:25:18 Many issues in the market, and some stocks are showing it
225 2018-08-14 21:22:17 Of course not. I got burned by penny stocks in late 2000
226 2018-08-14 21:22:16 I can wait a year or two. You cant afford to be impatient when you buying “penny” stocks.
227 2018-08-14 21:20:23 I’m one of the three who initiated the following today. Any idea why the entire #cannabis stocks have tanked in the last few days? #aph #aphria in particular
228 2018-08-14 21:19:15 It’s like stocks. Investing resources in companies (players) in hopes that they perform well each day so you can earn money. You can do all the technical analytics in the world on each player, but at the end of the day they can completely tank and fuck you over.
229 2018-08-14 21:19:06 ¡Vuelve la fiebre del OTC y las penny stocks a España ahora que podemos volver a operar con ellas!
230 2018-08-14 21:18:47 No stocks yet I’m afraid!
231 2018-08-14 21:18:39 I've gone for the stocks option. At least if the pound tanks they should keep their value.
232 2018-08-14 21:17:48 after wednesday do you look at stocks also as expirations are equal??
233 2018-08-14 21:17:16 The NV footage I saw/heard didn't sound like bump stocks though. The fire isn't rapid enough. Bump stocks seemingly skip a beat.
234 2018-08-14 21:16:35 odd... that reminds me of quantitative easing where the companies could borrow at 0% ... who then turned around and bought back their stocks... i guess they have more of their money now to do it without jacking up inflation
235 2018-08-14 21:15:49 Well at least we know your alive !
236 2018-08-14 21:15:19 Evening Market Wrap-up: stocks close higher as Turkish Lira rebounds.
237 2018-08-14 21:15:07 I'll take a stab -- for me, this is no man's land so it's a hard pass. There's better stocks out there
238 2018-08-14 21:14:57 All recently approved stocks are fodder for the day traders and shorts right now. It won't stop until the market as a whole stabilizes. It may not stop until they announce the launch.
239 2018-08-14 21:14:19 That is why stocks should be actually, not speculations.
240 2018-08-14 21:14:10 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
241 2018-08-14 21:14:05 Man. Why didn’t I buy Apple stocks when I was 5... what was I thinking 
242 2018-08-14 21:13:18 Was gonna buy some trainers from there as it’s the only place I can find that stocks the ones I want, what happened? Sorry if you’ve explained it before I can’t find any tweets!
243 2018-08-14 21:11:55 Stocks moved higher Tuesday as concerns over Turkey eased and investors focused on earnings. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) added over 100 points and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) had a substantial gain as well.

251 2018-08-14 21:09:35 When people ask you about how to invest in stocks, they usually don't want to truly know, they just want to talk about how wonderful investors they are.
252 2018-08-14 21:09:34 $CRON $CGC Weeks ago, a killer article was published called something like "People are buying pot stocks at the wrong time", and after that day, they all started to deteriorate, especially CRON.  No real reason otherwise. PR died as well. Comments?
253 2018-08-14 21:08:55 A lot of winners get posted on Twitter but I get some losing trades as well. $DCAR $AWX and $etc to name a few. It's not about how many you win, but about how you bounce back from the losses. Losing is part of trading #Stocks #Crypto #Options
254 2018-08-14 21:08:54 You are confusing price and news. The price did not go up because 9 mile is next March. It is a really big event with 25,000 attendees with big name artists and big name sponsors. However, this is the otc, no one holds stocks for more than 1-2month ...haha maybe even 1-2 weeks.

301 2018-08-14 20:47:26 I wanted to buy at 23-25$ but I had no cash in that moment . Today that I sold all my Chinese stocks I didn’t want to buy at 30$ .
302 2018-08-14 20:47:19 I know... I warned you about Chinese stocks a few days ago
303 2018-08-14 20:46:27 Well , much safer than Chinese stocks . Believe me .

330 2018-08-14 20:29:19 He will subsidize the agribusiness stocks while he fights the trade war with China.he already got the EU to come around..the worst thing he is doing financially is to not cut spending..but that hardly makes him worse than the Carter administration.or even H.W. Bush administration
331 2018-08-14 20:28:07 Also what is wrong with private Social Security too? That is a lot stronger if it is invested into stocks and bonds and will give you more money if you retire. It's a much safer investment than social security anyway
332 2018-08-14 20:28:01 Don’t be scared of expensive stocks. I made $700 today on $csu.to riding it from 949-966. Momentum. Charts #stocks #stockmarket #WorkFromHome @timothysykes #study #money #rich #millonairr
333 2018-08-14 20:28:00 So I don’t understand stocks. I have a stock valued at $1200 but the cash value rn is only $50 but if I sell its valued the same amount.
334 2018-08-14 20:27:57 Your tax cuts give 1%, and corporations have bought back 115 billion in stocks.  2.9 inflation and trillion dollar deficit next year.  Good job of bankrupting our country for you and your rich friends. Hardworking Americans are too smart to believe your lives.
335 2018-08-14 20:27:52 pretty much all those chinese stocks are saying the same story chartwise.
336 2018-08-14 20:27:29 I do think the market is wrong with their HO and RB positioning despite draws in RB and builds in HO. We can't export HO because stocks at rock bottom, but RB stocks are high enough to export. 

Unless of course I'm missing something big.

344 2018-08-14 20:22:54 How is privatized social security a bad thing? pay as you go or having the option to invest in stocks and bonds will not only make you more money, but is a safer investment anyway
345 2018-08-14 20:22:32 I heard some wise words that changed my investing but can't remember who the sage advise originated from. Invest like your rich not like you want to get rich. Swinging for the fences works out sometimes but your strikeouts go way up. Small ball works in stocks just like baseball.
346 2018-08-14 20:21:50 Wouldn't be surprised if Turkey disappears from the news, no tariffs news but stocks go all down in a couple of days.

350 2018-08-14 20:20:27 I should probably elaborate. What do you define as common sense gun control? Background Checks are pretty expansive as it is. Can't buy bump stocks anymore. It's illegal to modify your gun to be automatic. Most shootings are either suicides or done by pistols. 1/2
351 2018-08-14 20:20:03 Women are like investments; you have shorts and you have longs. There’s your blue chip stocks and then there’s your small caps.
352 2018-08-14 20:19:13 To many crooked politicians who own stocks in health insurance and pharmaceuticals. They should all have to divest from these companies.
353 2018-08-14 20:19:13 No more than many others, $DVAX for example. If you want to invest in products that will be commercial failures and Cos that will have permanent loss-making status, they're the stocks you want.
354 2018-08-14 20:19:09 Wall St decides that's enough worrying about Turkey: Stocks rally broadly, lifting Dow 112, +0.45% to 25,299.

Nasdaq and S&P both +0.6%. Russell 2000 +1.0% as smaller stocks are back in favor.

Winners top losers 21/8 on NYSE, 19/11 on Nasdaq.
355 2018-08-14 20:18:01 World stocks mixed: US +.6%; Europe flat. 2Q earnings-growth 25% helping stocks ward off trade tensions but a day-to-day thing. Emerging markets especially dangerous in the short-term. Europe priced right but growth slowing, will require patience. US best bet but not short-term.

397 2018-08-14 20:02:44 No. Owned by the Waltons, Costco, Walmart & Lowe’s are singlehandedly responsible for the extreme poverty swing America has experienced in the last 20 years. Not to mention Costco stocks the entire inventory of the DoD, that means they’re nothing more than a forward ops base.

401 2018-08-14 19:59:15 With micro-cap stocks great fear in a industry or country brings great opportunity. Many times a fragile thread of insight that you have that others don't can enable you to have the courage to build a serious position.
402 2018-08-14 19:58:38 Oh companies are using tax cuts to buy back stocks and not raising wages you say? 

How surprising

411 2018-08-14 19:54:24 Ready to vote, that's a no brainer. Protest either. Don't have stocks. I would love to see a general strike in America before I die (Ok, granted it is not anytime soon I hope) but I don't see it happening.
412 2018-08-14 19:53:45 Yeah! It's far off, but I've been trying to decide where the cutoff is, because I don't want a huge part of our net worth in single stocks. And, what to do with the money once I get near that cutoff. This seems a good solution.
413 2018-08-14 19:52:24 Uhhhh duh. These hefty tax cuts let these corporations—oops, sorry, citizens (under citizens united)— take their “hard earned” free tax money to reinvest in their own stocks, causing inflated value

415 2018-08-14 19:51:15 Jeff Sessions profits from the prison system.  He has major stocks in one of those prisons for profits that locks up blacks at a rate of 10-1 black to white.  And it's usually the whites committing felonies, not the blacks.
416 2018-08-14 19:50:44 Haha, I am short a basket of stocks including FB.  And long TWTR on the other side of it.  My way of playing a belief that TWTR is undervalued/underowned and FB is overvalued/overowned.

521 2018-08-14 18:52:24 The deficit went up 20% in 10 months, meaning taxpayers are subsidizing the tax cut. The tax cut is primarily being used by corps to buy back stocks, benefiting mainly wealthy shareholders. Middle class is seeing very little benefit.

524 2018-08-14 18:50:25 Yeah that’s what I’m gonna do. Sell some of my smaller stocks take the returns and buy more expensive stocks

531 2018-08-14 18:48:36 Lol this is like this is the only stock you talk about. Have a few other others but this is the majority. I find it funny how all of a sudden most people that are positive on these kind of stocks only talk about the one they are pumping and have nearly nothing else on the page.

535 2018-08-14 18:47:30 Watch List stocks most likely in my opinion to get run up at some point before end-2018 by big traders when all back: $DIGX $IJJP $EVSV $BTGI $AHIX $VMGI $BLLB $DGWR $TMPS (if they get USN contract mid-Sep) $OTTV. Many Q2s due filing by tomorrow & many of above will have updates

569 2018-08-14 18:32:57 I would contend that cryptocurrencies trade more like penny stocks/forex markets; less alpha here than with stock diversification. Most coins, with the exception of bitcoin, have either undefined/inflationary monetary policies, no working product, or no users. $BTC = hard money.

574 2018-08-14 18:30:42 Sure bruh. I could SD all of my stocks and you'd still find a way to lose.
575 2018-08-14 18:30:25 Rob, when do stocks follow suit?  What can be done to end the URA fiasco?  When stocks in their portfolio rise, it will trigger more URA sells.
576 2018-08-14 18:30:01 I am sure he wud have made money and exited with profits.

 In one of my studies i got buy vakrangee in dbl digits, sell came at 200 plus...but cct opened near 120....still not a losing trade.!!

And 2-3 stocks out of 20 30 even if u lose, no big deal!!
577 2018-08-14 18:29:43 He brought it up again, so I made a point to play a game where I took all 4 stocks at ~30% with back throw and dair.

651 2018-08-14 17:50:07 This mayor said HE would never drink Sam Adams beer again. It's a personal boycott not a city or state wide. No big loss to the company. This is a Democrat mayor so he probably only stocks up on what young boys would drink anyway.

660 2018-08-14 17:47:40 All it takes is smart investing. I know guys whose pensions jumped into the millions simply because they rode out the drop and bought cheap stocks that rose back up. Invest in high yield/risk stocks and bonds while you’re young then steadily move to more stable ones as you age.
661 2018-08-14 17:45:34 Nonsense. Buying into stocks with track records, fundamentals, a purpose, a plan is controlled, educated risk, as is starting a business. Crypto explosion built on pure exploitation, classic pump + dump, the whales will get out ahead, the desperate will be left holding the baby.
662 2018-08-14 17:44:55 I grew up - I had a job (sometimes more than one) - I invested - bought a home  - paid it off - not retired and loving life - my stocks are paying very good with POTUS at the wheel.  Very happy - thank you.
663 2018-08-14 17:43:35 Read Warren Buffett's annual letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway if you ever want to learn the importance of a long term time horizon when it comes to investing in businesses, either directly or through stocks. #yvr #stocks #investing #longterm
664 2018-08-14 17:43:28 Agree. What I care about is not how many are public vs. private but that I am able to capture most of the aggregate profit growth. Dilution of existing listed stocks by equity issuance is more of a concern than the number of companies listed.

671 2018-08-14 17:40:46 Great post. In Canada most people think of real estate first when it comes to investing. I’m curious to how much of Canadians investable assets is in real estate vs equities.

672 2018-08-14 17:39:25 How do you feel about making it illegal again for corporations to buy back their own stocks?   I believe that this should be illegal again.   These stock buybacks were made legal under the Reagan administration.

686 2018-08-14 17:34:58 Can't compare tokens to corp stocks, by assuming bull runs are irrational. I expect XRP to rise steadily once the decoupling occurs. First, more XRP base pairs on exchanges.

815 2018-08-14 16:35:19 #Stocks,#Indexes Minor top signal: what to do?  We normally ignore these, never chart them.  They're worrisome only when they may coincide with some adverse tech news, an Apple miss, e.g.

824 2018-08-14 16:28:21 IMHO, companies that have stocks should give every employee at least one share in their stocks. That way, if the company does well, the employees get a benefit other than that 5¢ raise.

Everything was similarly speculative at that time.

Coming to #Crypto, the potential intrinsic value is much more in #Crypto than mere stocks. This varies depending upon the token/network in question and will be 0 in a lot of cases.

In actuality any trade behaves the same. Someone sells, someone buys. So in that perspective #Crypto trade is equivalent to any other trade (#gold, #stocks etc). What you're hinting at is that the current bubble is speculative at best which is correct in a way.

849 2018-08-14 16:12:37 I think rage isn't a comeback mechanic because lower % doesn't indicate a lead when the goal is to take stocks as opposed to whittling down a health bar.

957 2018-08-14 15:27:34 Momentum investing doesnt happen in stocks that have never had value or growth...It is a mixed universe. The same stock goes from value / growth to momentum and back. So people who bot page for value or growth right now are riding momentum. 

(my 2 cents. other can disagree)

983 2018-08-14 15:15:29 I think so. Stocks are more volatile compared to the other options. The higher the volatility the higher the potential profits. Inflation eventually neutralises the gains from Treasury Bills. My humble opinion.

986 2018-08-14 15:15:16 To a large extent money market and treasury bills have tenored with fixed yield unlike stock which deals with the profitability of the organization. So stocks higher chances of a higher yield than both the money and treasury bills

1028 2018-08-14 15:03:04 Do not invest only based on P/E.
Some stocks always expensive but delivered consistent returns.
Examples: Page Industries, Pidilite,3M. etc.,
Some stocks cheap in terms of P/E but not good in wealth Creation.
Even in Cyclicals & Turnaround you can't decide on P/E.

Do China co in USA use #YinYangContracts to dodge US gov taxes? Tariffs? For below-market prices?

Does China gov tariff China-owned companies’ imports from USA? #MadTweets

1196 2018-08-14 13:51:39 Not investing in stocks and/or cryptocurrency like bitcoin when they first went public. The rate of inflation on some of these is insane.

1274 2018-08-14 13:21:40 Domestic benchmark equities ended higher today after two sessions of loss on buying in financial, healthcare and IT stocks. Buying was observed in most sectors, as positive inflation numbers influenced market sentiment.
1275 2018-08-14 13:20:11 Nice theory. In reality shorting is often abused for profit using sophisticated trading techniques that don't use fundamentals but instead usually trend lines on predictable stocks, and hedging, for a quick buck. Large groups can tank a stock with shorting based on flawed ideas.

1316 2018-08-14 12:57:32 I find it puzzling you seem to be taking my views on AKAO so personally. PRTK is an opportunity buy ahead of FDA, and I never said it would be taken out by anyone, so not sure where you're getting that. I don't fall in love with my stocks - they are commodities, and nothing more.

1318 2018-08-14 12:56:36 No worries- I was recommending vanadium stocks early last year (TNG, AVL, and I was nearly going to recommend old-mate's Tony Barton's play KRC...but was told it was too risky at the time LOFL). VRB's make up 1% of the market, still early days. Good luck with your V plays!

2) Increase in Account Deficit-increase inflation 
3) Factory products using imports will witness increase in pricing

But when a bull run comes, they don’t realize the people who chase shitty penny stocks and alt coins, will still chase them, so they will still go up. Behaviour >>> fundamentals
1352 2018-08-14 12:35:35 Good thing about trading is u can jump on the bandwagon when momentum starts.

1426 2018-08-14 11:28:24 Investors can't shrug off the crisis. Day traders play the price action and not the news. So if stocks spike (or fall), day traders are in and out on the price moves same day.
1427 2018-08-14 11:28:20 Doug, are you an investor or trader with regard to stocks. Do make calls based on fundamental analysis or price actions? Or a mixture of both?
1428 2018-08-14 11:25:27 Bitcoin doesn’t need an ETF or futures contracts, nor did stocks, bonds or other commodities. I agree. That said ETFs/financialization brought more liquidity, increased price stability/curbed volatility and created an increasingly safer environment for low cost managed ownership.
1429 2018-08-14 11:25:17 Me too. From street stocks to NASCAR. It’s all great.

1557 2018-08-14 09:15:39 there is a new age of psychedelia prevalent in Silicon Valley but instead of radical explorations of the human mind and sexual liberation, it's guys wearing Uniqlo tweeting nonsense about stocks and having seven day meetings presenting decks to each other about driverless Ubers
1558 2018-08-14 09:12:47 I would invest in a dividend paying stocks over real estate any day. Here’s my rationale: 

RM1mm invested in a stock w 4% div yield RM3.3k a month. That should be enough income to cover basic cost of living in Klang Valley. Capital grows at a faster rate than REs.

1565 2018-08-14 09:04:39 In Venezuela, owning chickens seems to have been good. They retain value and you can use them to barter when there aren't enough notes to go around. Plus, you get eggs. If it's just high inflation though, TIPs, stocks and real estate.

2) You are not exiting at the top even when "top" indications are there.
This is mostly the consequence of selecting bearish stocks and going long in them ! Look at long term charts/trends and then trade in short term. Bye.

1682 2018-08-14 06:44:26 Good to see gradual re-rating of the IT sector. Some stocks have already crossed 20 PE Fy20E. Can we see the average sector PE at 25+, with several tailwinds around? Let's watch the space.

Even in a hyperinflation good companies maintain purchasing power even though, as Buffett has noted, the earnings become lumpy in a highflation.

1787 2018-08-14 05:07:44 I’m shocked that @RobinhoodApp would block traders from buying penny stocks < 10¢. RH doesn’t offer OTC stocks so my guess is they don’t want any of their traders owning a delisted stock. Maybe RH should just offer OTC stocks.

1795 2018-08-14 05:01:47 sir, good value picks eventually become momentum stocks and once momentum breaks they go back to being a value pick.

This exchange keeps happening. You really cant differentiate a set of stocks as momentum stocks

Are page, nestle, britannia, reliance not worth it ?

1839 2018-08-14 04:26:46 I seriously doubt whether even 50% of the investing public active on Twitter have experienced 2013 in the Indian markets. It was a complete horror show, with no place to hide, unlike this year where people have been able to hide in a few select large cap stocks.
1840 2018-08-14 04:22:51 Their is no sense of urgency to own gold. Sentiment is healthy. Fear is in a healthy, skeptical wall of worry camp. With many stocks still cheap or fairly valued, I don’t see a reason to make the shift toward a safe haven. Inflation is still relatively tame, wages flat

1846 2018-08-14 04:11:51 There are ALWAYS a few stocks doing a Page or an MRF. 

Problem is not JUST buying before they move up but the conviction to *ADD* more as it keeps going up.

1 or 2 units won't make u wealthy but holding onto 100 or 200 will!

1856 2018-08-14 04:01:30 Stocks correcting coz of outside conditions/force will come back (like 2008, brexit etc). But if it falls coz of earnings miss.  Story is over. That’s my view, everyone have there own perspective that’s why it’s called market. Like u r contrarian, u will be right 1 day. 
1857 2018-08-14 04:00:07 Why good stocks get hammered in panic market situations much below their fair values?

Because in panic situations when redemptions increase and liquidity dries up, institutional investors don't sell what they should, but what they can.
1858 2018-08-14 03:59:41 Wall Street dragged down by fall out from Turkey's plunging lira: U.S. stocks dropped on Monday as global jitters from Turkey's plummeting currency spread to Wall Street, with the S&P 500 and the Dow falling for the fourth session in a row.

2046 2018-08-14 01:34:10 You have a choice: take the money they were bought for (so say I have 3 shares and each one sold for $5 I'd get $15 from it all) or if you have enough in equivalent value you can trade it for one of their stocks.
2047 2018-08-14 01:33:14 I mean if you were really rich and really liked Vectors I guess it's not awful. Plus you can get double the money back in stocks... For a company that probably won't exist

2051 2018-08-14 01:31:20 Certainly not the practice of shorting stocks and then announcing to the stock investing community that you've done just that and reaping in instant profits.....

Not that I'm saying anyone ever has done that.
2052 2018-08-14 01:29:50 Don't remain too hopeful for those kinds of price drops here, it just won't happen.
LP's have hundreds of millions of stocks sold to pay dividends on.

The PC govt is stuck on enforcement to elim black market, as it has been so effective in the past lol
Be messy for a few years.
2053 2018-08-14 01:29:06 Newbie tip: The PSEi chart shows the condition of the top 30 companies i think. So for an instance, the price closed like a quite tall red bar so it means that a lot of stocks’ prices went down.
2054 2018-08-14 01:26:55 Also market doesn’t typically refer to the independent selling of a personal account on a game. More trade, stocks, etc. like selling grain.
2055 2018-08-14 01:25:20 I hope you had thousands of dollars in their stocks
2056 2018-08-14 01:23:39 I should buy stocks at Tesla with Elon’s decision to take it private 
2057 2018-08-14 01:23:34 The bottom, bottom line here: The Republican Party simply doesn’t know how to and/or is unable to govern when in the majority, except for tax cuts of course. Immigration, nothing; infrastructure, nothing; bump stocks, nothing; and the most importtant of all, health care, nothing!

2065 2018-08-14 01:16:09 The great depression crash was due to the stock market being as unregulated as the bitcoin market is today.  As in the dot-com era, stocks were issued for companies that had no way to make a revenue.  Like bitcoin.

2083 2018-08-14 01:05:49 1) tough talk where both he and Mnunchin say they want a weaker dollar?  2) Hawkish posturing that started in 2015 not 2018.  3)  Fed put?  Where?  Stocks fell 10% and they still raised 4).  I'll give you that  5).  Has been going on before Q1 2018.

Those opportunities don't appear every day.
Greed took the best of me and i paid the price...lesson learned.
2098 2018-08-14 00:55:03 Also if u see covered longs/stocks shorts got increased recently so they too r expecting some downmove wherein they r trying to hedge their positions....do share your views as well :)
2099 2018-08-14 00:51:50 1) Trump's "tough talk" directed to both friends and foes; 2) Powell's hawkish posturing whenever he opens his mouth; 3) aggressive ESF placement of a tight "Fed Put" under stocks; 4) aggressive pursuit of trade war policies; 5) withdrawal from Iran nuclear pact; sabre-rattling.
2100 2018-08-14 00:51:05 Kudos Mark; someone who understands the fundamental difference between an imaginary asset value and real money .

2107 2018-08-14 00:48:45 I mean I know a lot of extremely smart value investors that seem naturally attracted to difficult situations.
I think I am a value investor in that I focus on buying low price to intrinsic value stocks, not just low PE/PB. Value is my process.

2119 2018-08-14 00:35:38 You know what I’ve realized with these stocks that have underperformed? They usually keep underperforming no matter how much call buying or put selling. It’s too hard trying to find the bottom.
2120 2018-08-14 00:35:14 The more relevant benchmark for users is the one that’s the proxy for crypto market cap. Basically any model has to be able to beat a naive investor who buys everything equally. In stocks the equal weight benchmark is extremely tough to beat

2142 2018-08-14 00:15:56 Correct...but now US Trilemma governs, & clearly Fed spooked with rise in rates & fall in USD as stocks fell in Feb.  Had to defend USD.

2147 2018-08-14 00:02:14 Growth stocks get hammered but if they are true growth stocks they will rebound. The Nifty 50 got crushed because they were grossly overvalued and their high growth years were behind them.  The same tech and biotech stocks leading now may not be the market leaders in the future.
2148 2018-08-14 00:02:12 About time we re-introduce the stocks and place them in Fed Square. Let the public express their views directly with the perpetrator. The courts have proven a dismal failure, so we need a change.
