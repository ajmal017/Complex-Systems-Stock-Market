I want them put in stocks in the public square where I can walk by and spit on them anytime I feel like it !
You don't have to limit yourself to spitting though.

54 2018-08-15 23:27:08 I'm not even allowed to buy stocks.
55 2018-08-15 23:26:07 Hope you are back between the sticks at blues very soon Stocks. No1 keeper. Hopefully Monk will see sense.
56 2018-08-15 23:23:30 US stocks take biggest tumble in weeks, global equities and commodities sink as lira soars 7 percent against the dollar on Turkey's trade countermoves and Qatar's pledge of $15 billion in investments
57 2018-08-15 23:23:30 It's amazing. "Dog," is a reference to be a bad player, a bad stocks, a bad employee. Of course morons in the MSM take it to the extreme
58 2018-08-15 23:23:13 @UAW I see the US stock market is falling!  I see some of the Unions are doing as I 
indicated, to buy overseas stock, because if you buy stocks in US companies, you are helping those whom are against Unions.   We need to inform our works to invest in foreign stocks or real estat
59 2018-08-15 23:21:42 May I add that not all blues fans are slagging him off. I have already told Stocks that I rate him highly and I for one do not want him to go. Monk has made a decision for whatever reason and we all have to and do trust Monks decision, however I would rather have stocks in goal.
60 2018-08-15 23:21:18 That is the question, it would be illogical, however if you think money market, evil thoughts, if the price of shares drops because of tragedies, it is cheaper to buy the stocks, so maybe there needs to be a look into stock manipulation intent by someone in the market.
61 2018-08-15 23:19:56 Ugly god fr bruh u a funny dude but that’s it, like talent wise for rapping it just AINT IT chief, I’d say invest yo money in stocks or real estate cause soon you gonna be ugly and broke god
62 2018-08-15 23:17:48 I'm sure he also own a lot of real estate, which increases by about 10% in value per year. Stocks and similar investments that can make much, much more than 10% a year. I wonder what his actual net-worth is. #LebronJames

66 2018-08-15 23:16:11 When they convict @POTUS, can part of the sentance that he's put in stocks for 2 weeks, like the times he want's to get back to?  I'd love a chance to walk up to his smug face and tell him he's a piece of shit before I smear honey on his face and release bees.
67 2018-08-15 23:15:05 today’s plunge in gold, silver, platinum, and gold stocks on huge volume after a long decline looks like a classic selling climax.

70 2018-08-15 23:13:53 Stocks still doing "tremendously" well, while wages are relatively stagnant and inflation is rising. Trade wars are creating inflation/over-taxation on goods.

81 2018-08-15 22:58:44 @jimcramer You had an opportunity to push back at Eliz Warren that ONLY 10% of Americans have money in stocks. All her Union friends have their pensions in the stock market. Really 10% . Who is covering all those pension shortfalls. Jim you are better than that !!
82 2018-08-15 22:57:11 @SEIU_GRHudson  I see the US stock market is falling!  I see some of the Unions are doing as I indicated, to buy overseas stock, because if you buy stocks in US companies, you are helping those whom are against Unions. We need to inform our works to invest in foreign stocks

84 2018-08-15 22:54:09 What is really upsetting is Mnuchin indexing capital gains. So all those corps that bought back stocks, their CEOs can cash in their stock options for a buyback & not be taxed 35%.

95 2018-08-15 22:46:41 False Alarm in US Mkts once again. 
Whilst EU+EM+JAP+CHI have several problems (not just today), US Stocks  close peacefully in calm.

96 2018-08-15 22:45:37 Ha! I actually hope you're right! Of course they pay with cash, that's why the prices have been inflating so fast. But they're 0-income investments (these houses are all vacant, which is why they're known to be foreign), and if dividends on stocks go down, you need to sell...
97 2018-08-15 22:45:35 I mentioned DRC stocks because they are the ones you mentioned! but yes they are! and might not forever! just saying maybe a new route for teh co wouldnt go astray to "create value" DRC has been done and they are dying. maybe a new path could be better! just saying!
98 2018-08-15 22:45:11 All of that relies on the ever-changing needs/wants of the consumer. Stocks fluctuate, even if they’re small or profitable now. They rely on a market. Then everything you listed that’s not stocks or market management, requires hard work & dedication for little chances of success

103 2018-08-15 22:42:25 Such a silly definition. -20% equals "bear" market. History shows -20% more often is an excellent buy opportunity, not the opposite. But Hey, who does research and analysis when we can all parrot each other and feel smart? #ausbiz #XJO #investing #equities #stocks

my plan is just buy silver and mining shares on a constant basis until global stocks correct again

$40 silver will be nice, even if it's 5 years from now
112 2018-08-15 22:34:51 It's not a game for the wealthy. In fact I feel it's the opposite. I started in crypto only invest $100 and that turned into something. It's hard to find a way to invest such a little amount in stocks unless there are tons of hidden fees associated with it.
113 2018-08-15 22:34:29 all i'm seeing is some shit talking about cereal stocks
114 2018-08-15 22:33:36 Well that's out the window. In the last 7 years you would have outperformed gold, if you just held USD, and forgot about the inflation on it... Not mentioning buying stocks or crypto in this timeframe.
115 2018-08-15 22:33:13 I don’t short stocks.

119 2018-08-15 22:30:34 Pretty well known fact that central bankers are humanitarians at  and are simply taking bullion off public s, so as to free them up from such a silly, no-yield asset, thus allowing them to buy tech stocks as God intended. 
120 2018-08-15 22:29:57 @SenWarren great talk about corporate buybacks and short term profits squeezing. What the CEOs and board members are doing is criminal! The big challenge I do foresee is how to solve this without negatively lowering the amount of taxes we are collecting from higher stocks.

124 2018-08-15 22:28:47 I’ve never liked 2 stocks... makes the game even less consistent. Did you just get janked by rage, SD, or something wack happened? Sucks for you good luck coming back from that. 3 stocks is so much better
125 2018-08-15 22:26:40 Gina, that's a lie, stop.

People who do not pay taxes are mainly low income folks and people on social security. Some are the very rich, who store their money in off-shore accounts and stocks.

It's a fact that the majority of low income people live in red states.

Why lie?
126 2018-08-15 22:26:22 Also this is not a new development. The dollar has been on a 7-year run.  We had the taper tantrum and the '16 EM bear market..where EM stocks got absolutely crushed
127 2018-08-15 22:25:53 That’s great, but I mean from a writing point of view.

129 2018-08-15 22:24:57 As risk management i only invest in ETFs. have never purchased individual stocks in any company because i fear the possibility that it could go kaput or they might do something so demonic like sayin the N word nd then i lose my bread. What possessed me to buy ALL of the shitcoins
130 2018-08-15 22:24:32 And Trump supporters claim they aren't racist. Nobody believes you

When last you take stocks of all Schools in Osun?
132 2018-08-15 22:22:27 Could not have said it better.
133 2018-08-15 22:22:11 You just don’t know how to properly degen yet with stocks. I have had a helluva run lately.
134 2018-08-15 22:21:00 Why do we let people buy stocks that they do nothing for?
A better economy: 
1) only commercial banks
2) only private investors & investment clubs
3) loans couldn’t be used to buy securities would be a better economy
4) no 401k
135 2018-08-15 22:20:32 This dude voted for a Communist. They just dumped a Lt. from West Point for being a Communist and this guy ran a clandestine agency...twisted..
136 2018-08-15 22:20:26  Have a look these #stocks that marked record highs: $ADP, $SQ
137 2018-08-15 22:19:58 The problem was Brawl was horrible with 3 stocks due to time outs and defensive play and such and people didn't want that to repeat with Smash 4. The problem is that early kills and defensive campy play can both happen in S4, making 2 and 3 stocks have downsides
138 2018-08-15 22:18:35 Did you read about the current housing "bust"....look at some facts of what is currently going on instead of accepting the BS from FOX FALSE NEWS.  And what happened to retail stocks after analysts read beyond headlines...future very uncertain.

Put all their savings into ginger stocks. Can't retire.
142 2018-08-15 22:17:37 Obviously didn't see retail stocks tank after analysts read a little further beyond headlines.
143 2018-08-15 22:17:35 Exactly.  If he is no longer serving he no longer needs access to government secrets.  They didn't renew my clearance when I exited the Marines, Ron should really keep his coattail riding comments to himself, I used to really like him.

148 2018-08-15 22:15:50 Why not both? Cash is still my largest allocation atm, but I'll be averaging down into value stocks and metals the worse they look during this global dollar short squeeze. True bagholder style.

151 2018-08-15 22:15:29 I'm not a broker or investment expert, but I always heard that when you hear buzz about how good is a stock, and every body seems to be like: hey let's buy this! 
That's the exact moment when you have to start selling your stocks....

156 2018-08-15 22:12:35 No didn't lose, just could have made more. I just sell stock and it just goes way up. I think I should sell info on what stocks I sell so others can make money  haha

168 2018-08-15 22:05:01 They are supposed to work for us. Not the other way around. We are not their employees, we are the product that stocks their shelves.

170 2018-08-15 22:04:23 If you’re reading the media’s headlines, you’d think that the economy is doing great. Stocks in the major indexes are at peak levels and investors aren’t seeing much point in hedging their portfolios. After all, why bother when the economy is doing well?

…
171 2018-08-15 22:03:48 i can move in for a couple of days and ur stocks will be empty soon enough
172 2018-08-15 22:03:45 In France they give them "hairdryers" to drive that is similar to an spell on the village Stocks
173 2018-08-15 22:02:33 And I'll be averaging in at every stop to $850 because I'm an absolute madman and hate money. Plus I'm too dull to grasp the new paradigm and how gold is no longer neccessary because FANG stocks are a generational store of value.
174 2018-08-15 22:01:36 Stocks barely budged compared to the hammering in Gold/Silver, not to mention PM's haven't even risen over the past decade. It's just a dog and pony show to make people believe there are still "markets".
175 2018-08-15 22:01:35 Hey Michelle, apologies, seems they have been rather popular! The stores have stocks on order, sorry for the disappointment 
176 2018-08-15 22:01:24 Well given that Brexit seems on the verge of setting us back years, let’s go back a bit further still, and have stocks in public squares - then the punishment would truly be in the community, by the community + for the community
177 2018-08-15 22:01:02 Unless of course he was speaking to Congress and lying through his teeth about spying on us....
178 2018-08-15 22:00:11 You lied before Congress about spying on the American people. You tried to undermine our government and overthrow it. Frankly, be thankful it's just a clearance that got revoked. If it was me running this, you would have been arrested.
179 2018-08-15 21:59:11 no hurry to get back in until test of 200dma. Aug and sept are horrible months for stocks. $M
180 2018-08-15 21:58:52 I should clarify: All my peanuts=liquid assets. I still maintain the typical portfolio of stocks and bonds in my 401k which is fairly illiquid.
181 2018-08-15 21:58:50 Great day for MJ stocks!!
182 2018-08-15 21:58:29 Such bs. Stocks are down bc its august and institutions and whales are coming back in sept, so they are pushing to lower the price b4 coming back in.
183 2018-08-15 21:58:19 Unusual suspect stocks.  The bleeding looks like a set up:  $WYNN $LVS $CZR $MLCO $MGM
184 2018-08-15 21:57:40 Yeah that's a no. It was professional courtesy to have former agency heads retain their clearances. I lost mine when I left. Many others did too. Just because he is a lobbyist doesn't make him special. Revoke all the clearances.
185 2018-08-15 21:57:03 Compounding...what stocks tend to do, before you buy them.
186 2018-08-15 21:56:50 Yikes!! An ominous headline on a day when oil stocks dropped 3%
187 2018-08-15 21:55:19 Not nice seeing stocks drop and profits disappearing. #ars #evrh #sml all fell a long way but the story’s themselves are improving
188 2018-08-15 21:53:52 My mom stopped giving me her [unwarranted] suggestions for marriage partners when she realized I care about making money more  She went from “so I told ___ son about you, can I give him your number?” To “so I’m looking into stocks for ____ are you interested in buying?”
189 2018-08-15 21:53:18 Agree in principle, however, the past few U3O8 rallies we have seen stocks perform as expected, ie: move up linearly at a higher % rate. Maybe this time is the real deal?
190 2018-08-15 21:51:51 Absolutely hilarious how being positive and vocal about an investment, you can then be blamed for the sp dropping . There’s been a slump lots of stocks have been hit . No point blaming others. When the story is improving it’s only a matter of time until real value shines through
191 2018-08-15 21:49:41 Anyways who wants to teach me about stocks ?
192 2018-08-15 21:49:40 They won't just yet. First you get the commodity buyers (YellowCake and others) then you get the speculators, then the hedge funds the mainstream investors. That is why is is the perfect time to get in while stocks are still this low. Stocks leveraged to U price.
193 2018-08-15 21:49:00 Sir. With respect. You might want to read a lot more news. I hate to tell you this but you sound silly. For the last i believe 3 years apple has been buying its stock in record number back in you guessed it buy backs. To artificially raise their value. To due splitting stocks
194 2018-08-15 21:48:17 Stocks
195 2018-08-15 21:48:12 The market is wrong. Remember some funds can't hold 'illegal' pot stocks. Just like some don't hold cigarette stocks. LT this is huge and profitable for $STZ
196 2018-08-15 21:47:52 Quick! Everyone panic and start stockpiling again! Please? OUR STOCKS ARE DOWN! MORE OUTRAGE!
197 2018-08-15 21:47:37 yeah, seems so. Main question what to buy for bounce - copper miners , EM stocks ( Russia, Brazil). something else? )
198 2018-08-15 21:46:52 U stocks not yet following suit.
199 2018-08-15 21:46:43 I should Buy Sam Adams stocks  the democrats from Mass.just made this beer beat  analyst expectations.
200 2018-08-15 21:46:18 The Federal Reserve keeping rates at near zero for banks & big corporations to goose their stocks for free is not what I'd call capitalism.

202 2018-08-15 21:45:25 The only thing that the tax cut did was give the corporations the chance to do massive stock buybacks. Look into why Apple topped 1$1 trillion. Hint: If you buy back your corporate stocks, the remaining shares increase in value.

205 2018-08-15 21:43:45 Bayo combos would also not make people as mad. It would be kinda like Puff in Melee where she has the potential to kill in like 3-4 hits where instead of “this is so broken” it would be “eh two more stocks I can do this”
206 2018-08-15 21:43:38 A Socialist is nothing more than a coward who doesn't have the spine to kick in their neighbors doors and steal from them. They use government instead to steal for them.
207 2018-08-15 21:43:34 Totally agree, that's where the bugs go wrong. And then the haters react w/ a TD dance if doesn't go up if stocks sell off and round we go. That's why I make the zero corr point.
208 2018-08-15 21:42:05 And Obama did such a bang up job with Flint....Lol....you should have a doc adjust those meds you're taking. Clearly it's not enough.
209 2018-08-15 21:41:06 @GOP @SpeakerRyan
Please do not let us think that you guys are ok w/all this shit being
caused by Donald. Any person or persons who would stand by and
allow Donald to make laughing stocks out of them, when all along
they've had the power to stop him, are ignorant sociopaths!

212 2018-08-15 21:40:37 What has President Trump done to deserve the visceral hate from the left? - He beat the anointed one...
213 2018-08-15 21:39:54 Interesting: Only if you invest with someone else’s money are you not allowed to give price targets on specific stocks. Giving your price targets, even for a fee in an investment club, is ok as long as you aren’t an investment or commercial bank.
214 2018-08-15 21:39:28 Don’t forget destroyed the value of hydro one who Ontarians own 47% of the stocks. The stock dropped by $250 million on day one of Fords firings. Also no one has been named CEO.
215 2018-08-15 21:39:16 You mean by cutting Medicaid, Medicare & Social Security because he gave the wealthy & corporations huge tax cuts which added 1.5 Trillion to the deficit. The CEO’s aren’t putting that money back into their companies or increasing wages, they’re buying back stocks instead.

220 2018-08-15 21:36:22 maybe go choke
221 2018-08-15 21:36:02 I would add it also depends what your trading. Every book I read said you need 50k-100k. And I agree...if you're trading stocks, but if you're trading futures like me....I wish I would've started with 5k instead of 50k. Plenty of leverage with 5k for a futures day trader.
222 2018-08-15 21:35:28 dismissed a Democratic proposals to ban bump stocks & prevent dangerous individuals from receiving a concealed carry permit, saying, “I don’t think anyone in the history of our state has ever been killed by a bump stock” & “neither one of them is very serious.
223 2018-08-15 21:35:19 I feel like I should read more on information economics.  I'm curious to know what current thought by economists on how this influences (or explains|interacts with) behaviors we observe of buyers and sellers, from stocks to consumer goods.

230 2018-08-15 21:32:25 For a young bloke, does this promote stocks/funds that pay dividend. Without it, stocks don’t ‘compound’ do they ?
231 2018-08-15 21:31:18 Ah that makes sense then. So him buying HoF has meant your stocks have dropped? That sucks!
232 2018-08-15 21:31:17 babes ik as a troll ur main focus is to deflect ur misery onto others but i’m sorry to tell ya that i’m healthy & happy & don’t need to overcompensate through trolling. move along

235 2018-08-15 21:30:14 No this is my hobby. One cannot make money tweeting UNLESS.... I just found out today there's a shady dude giving out advice in a private Twitter stream. Oh dear. 

And of course Twitter is a method of manipulating thinly traded stocks, so there is that.

243 2018-08-15 21:26:59 I think maybe we should wait 6-12 months to see which are the true leaders lol! Too many stocks to keep in one acronym. 6 months ago we would’ve included EMH as well
244 2018-08-15 21:26:54 wow, you are desperate.  this was released in December.  Nothing new.  Trump had a good first yr with stocks, not as good as Obama's first year, but still good. I can see why you are not quoting 2018 numbers.
245 2018-08-15 21:26:25 Going back to the start of the 90s you'll find that legal interventions on weapons supplies began to be ignored during the gulf War.
Later of course post 2001 stocks & shares of the military industrial complex are mostly highs.
War & death is a racket now with mps quids in!
246 2018-08-15 21:26:10 Already been proven that large corporations used tax cuts to buyback their own stocks. Trickle down didn't work during Reagan and it's not working now. Cutting regulations on large corporations has only opened the floodgates for them to financially prey on the consumer.
247 2018-08-15 21:25:50 It would be awesome if @cnbc could just call it Cannabis. You don't call pharma narco stocks or hillbilly heroin.
248 2018-08-15 21:24:26 The excessive crypto coverage on @CNBCFastMoney is becoming exhausting. I was hoping for some in-depth coverage of the STAB stocks today but that doesn't seem to be on the schedule. Hopefully there was some analysis done before going all out crypto.

380 2018-08-15 20:15:10 Workers put away 15% of their paychecks for retirement (payroll taxes). They're earning a 0% return on that after inflation. At best, they can earn 3%. Wtf!! Why are we preventing workers from owning stocks and growing their wealth by 7%? That is the cause of wealth inequality.
381 2018-08-15 20:14:42 US stocks end broadly lower but up from lows amid global rout. Nasdaq hit hard after weak earnings from China tech giant Tencent. Commodity slump fans global econ growth worries.

Nasdaq -1.2%, S&P -0.8%, Russell 2000 -1.3%.

384 2018-08-15 20:13:39 World stocks tumble: Europe -1.4%; US -.8%. Trade tensions, emerging market debacle & fear of contagion convinced investors to sell stocks & buy Treasuries. Positive economic news not enough to balance fear. Trump policies mean no surety for short-term except for high volatility.

434 2018-08-15 19:55:55 The gun reform proposals do not suggest banning semi automatic weapons,  only 'assault style' weapons,  which SCOTUS did not include as protected.  There are proposals to ban bump stocks, which were intended to do an end run around an existing ban on automatic weapons.

514 2018-08-15 19:18:52 The UK is one of the world's largest exporters of arms.  The country as a whole isn't going to stop manufacturing or selling them just because we aren't using them ourselves.  If anything, we'd sell even more because we would have our own stocks to dispose of as well.

516 2018-08-15 19:16:40 The cannabis stocks valuations are based on today black market price & assuming so much increase in demand. IMO many would face the same fate as Valeant ( $VRX ) in 2015-2016. So the question is when market would realize that these companies can't earn as much as investors wish.

552 2018-08-15 18:57:16 One of the tactics that is very useful is to quickly scan your lists and note what stocks are hanging in. Refusing to fall. #stocks
553 2018-08-15 18:57:08 i actually think the opposite. i think we’re going to get a lot more uptrend. the dollar is growing stronger, unemployment is low, stocks are fine. the economy has performed the opposite of what many expected.
554 2018-08-15 18:56:57 We should put them in stocks and let the public deal with them.

556 2018-08-15 18:56:12 I wondered why stocks are plummeting again today, but now I see that you’ve tweeted about the economy again.  Every damn time you say something about the economy, stocks fall.  It’s almost as if everyone thinks you don’t know what the hell you’re talking about.
557 2018-08-15 18:55:53 The good thing about these days is the pullback to pivot in some good performers. Keep an eye on them but always with tight stops because one day there is no pullback. #StockMarket #stocks #stockstowatch
558 2018-08-15 18:54:17 I guess it's really both BEFORE and AFTER.
You need to wait and be extremely picky about which stocks you choose.
And then after finding a big winner, you sit and wait, letting it run up for you.
Bill O'Neil always taught to wait for a big winner and then wait for it to run up.

589 2018-08-15 18:42:55 The issue for me isn't what periods in history stocks did "the best", but what % to allocate among stocks, bonds, cash, etc. at any given time in the real world. In this regard, the Fed model is simple and logical.

That said, even if it wasn't on back of energy (it appears to be), it's not like a rising USD, rising rates, & falling stocks are going to be good for auto or home sales.

Next recession, stocks will completely decouple from the real economy imo. Escape from gov paper into literally anything.
640 2018-08-15 18:21:40 Y’all goina laugh when I become a bajilionair off these @Benadryl stocks.
641 2018-08-15 18:21:36 Thank you so much. I am holding Manappuram 70, Rain industries 46, Nocil 80 and piramal enterprise 2280 would love to learn more on these stocks. Once again thank you so much!!! :)
642 2018-08-15 18:21:10 If you're not buying stocks right now you're foolish. This is a complete fake selloff. Turkey putting tariffs of Alcohol and Automobiles is a $61 million dollar joke. The fact that it's the number one headline is a bigger joke. Extreme value in $SPY $QQQ $DIA $IWM #StockAlert

645 2018-08-15 18:20:44 Most Chinese stocks are off the lows. But US stocks are at the lows
646 2018-08-15 18:20:35 MBS have moved higher and stocks lower this morning due to increased concerns about economic troubles in Turkey and other emerging markets. A large batch of U.S. economic data was mixed after factoring in revisions and had little net impact.
647 2018-08-15 18:20:21 Worth noting from this article:
Mr. Dell informed board and major shareholders 6 months before a press release to the public. I mean for 6 months privileged shareholders knew about it and could (most likely did) take advantage of it, even by not selling stocks.

648 2018-08-15 18:20:20 Diversify Gali, why put everything in one basket. Just get some boring stocks, gives you some dividend. Some ETF in the mix.  Just to get some sleep. Shares can drop very fast, people tend to forget this in a bull market.

651 2018-08-15 18:18:56 If $HMNY hits .06 it would be 100% from .03 this morning
652 2018-08-15 18:18:23 I agree with the yield, just that I would have waited intil the September FED hike and see how things play out
653 2018-08-15 18:18:02 The fiscal spending news from Turkey helping risk sentiment and stocks are bouncing..
654 2018-08-15 18:17:44 No bounce at all in US stocks so far..
655 2018-08-15 18:16:57 Stocks in the US getting hit now and USDJPY heading to test support at 110.50
656 2018-08-15 18:16:55 i know... but for long term $cvx is a safe bet... also very good divident yield..
657 2018-08-15 18:15:06 $HMNY sell all you want, buy all you want, hold all you want, it doesnt matter!  This is a unicorn in my opinion and I see this being one of those stocks that people will say, "I bought this under a dollar, LOOK AT IT NOW!"
658 2018-08-15 18:14:56 One of Smash 4's meta problems were it's stock count. In 3 stocks Falcon UpAir to Knee is hype, you just got bodied. In 2 stocks its 'wow, that was really lame.' I think that perception is important
659 2018-08-15 18:14:35 CT guns laws enacted since Sandy Hook. Fully constitutional, held up in court. Bans bump stocks,220 assault weapons,high capacity magazines. Gun crimes are down about 35%,deaths nearly 50%. No weapons owned before ban confiscated but have to register them. You didn't do your H/W.
660 2018-08-15 18:14:33 Funny how we don't use pingala retracement in stocks, rather it's fibonacci.  Kinda how Edison has been given credit as father of electricity, while Nikola Tesla was brushed under the rug.  LoL  if it wasn't for Tesla we'd still be burning candles. 
661 2018-08-15 18:14:22 All stocks are down except $CMG  chipotle is up $28

664 2018-08-15 18:13:50 Common Sam, @AlderLaneeggs was interrupted by @QTRResearch mid sentence when he said that. Anyone listening knows it was a figure of speech. Instead of bashing people, why not talk about the stocks? You are sounding psychotic frankly, Cohodes works his ass off. $OSTK $MDXG
665 2018-08-15 18:13:00 I mean the odd stocks with cacti on makes me happy and queer
666 2018-08-15 18:12:22 Is any analysts are truly sick and tired of Chinese stocks slamming U.S. Stocks for crap returns on their currencies? You have to wonder which Bitcoin Currencies the Chinese, Koreans, Turkeys, Venezuelans are holding. @PowerLunch @SquawkCNBC
667 2018-08-15 18:11:49 Look at Connecticut's gun laws enacted post Sandy Hook and since revised. Gun crimes have dropped significantly,deaths are almost cut in half, bump stocks and 220 assault style weapons are banned. No weapons owned prior to the ban were confiscated but they had to register them.
668 2018-08-15 18:11:32 Nope. It's about stocks. If you are referring mutual funds here, the calculation is not straightforward.

672 2018-08-15 18:09:27 On if we play stamina with stocks because it would be much more fun for a final smash to just feel like a super. Chances are it won't be a tournament bracket so i guess if we're talking about normal smash then it would have to be off.
673 2018-08-15 18:08:33 You forgot assets, stocks and businesses

683 2018-08-15 18:04:31 It's the #TradeWars triggering this #stockmarket rotational trading, not Turkey's woes. Looking at the NASDAQ 100, the all-star index for the past few years, $MELI $JD $EA and $NFLX, perennial hot money magnets, all dipping. But #commodities-linked stocks are the real concern.

690 2018-08-15 18:02:24 Gvts actually used to have buffer stocks for key commodities to stabilize their price. JG is similar in that sense.

696 2018-08-15 17:58:59 Point taken. How do you get the aggregate index performance according to all the local currencies btw? But always feel that those uber-long time frames are a bit pointless (ie argument US stocks were in a bear market 2000-13).

701 2018-08-15 17:57:08 Good. Smart people can disagree about stocks, I just perceived more risk from the beginning than you. And I didn’t want to see you lose a shitload of money because I saw risks you didn’t. That’s all.
702 2018-08-15 17:56:43 @FBE I just watched your “Generations react to gun control in America” let me just say that I think personally it was extremely biased. I didn’t see a single video of anyone defending the second amendment. I saw videos of false statistics and information. Bump stocks? Really?

709 2018-08-15 17:54:59 It's such a tedious grind at the moment. Just gotta stay calm and ride it out but don't do anything daft  (like buying loads of Stocks  !!). I can't see much changing until Brexit moved on a lot. Cash is very attractive at moment  !!
710 2018-08-15 17:54:22 And while I've certainly had a few "dogs", I'm quite content to recommend investors avoid stocks I find overloved, overowned, and overhyped. There are so many other names out there with fewer champions, better yields, greater stability & higher potential for "safer" gains
711 2018-08-15 17:54:18 If the stocks are not moving when U hits 50 dollars I am really surprised. In case we need to wait for that long, the move will probably be quite violent. That is the break even point for mining profitability for the majority of mines.
712 2018-08-15 17:54:15 Scene: bemused Azelia Banks watches as Grimes comforts Elon Musk on a bad trip after he made illegal tweets about short selling stocks while on acid. Feelings? (Swear I’m not a Musk themed account, the absurd shit just keeps happening)
713 2018-08-15 17:54:12 Not 1 chart analyst called bottom in Gold or Silver in 2015. Because,all of them said it had to go under 1000$. Gold & silver are even more fundamentally undervalued now,relative to price of real estate and stocks. And,closer to mining cost.
Bigger, steeper,rally than 2015 coming

717 2018-08-15 17:53:12 Here's a comment I haven't seen Wed re. sell-off in crude oil: 
Crude oil lower as weekly stocks number continues to confirm the downtrend in CLV8/CLX8 that began following the peak of 6/28 at an inverse of 81cts. Spread sitting at an inverse of 27cts, w/daily stocks nearing 20%.
718 2018-08-15 17:53:04 Global Markets: Stocks tumble; emerging markets hit as dollar rises, yuan falls: Equities around the world took a dive on Wednesday, with emerging market stocks set to confirm a bear market and the dollar hitting a 13-month high, while weakness in China's yuan rattled…
719 2018-08-15 17:52:28 Its very bullish to have spot #uranium price increase while most of the commodity complex is melting down the last month.  If the price keeps edging up stocks will follow.

722 2018-08-15 17:50:21 Unfortunately it's probably going to cost you $7 just to make the trade (@robinhood etc. mostly won't let you buy penny stocks bc they lose money on the trades & custody). But I'll happily sell you my share for $5 :P

734 2018-08-15 17:43:33 Do you think it odd that we measure bear markets in EM stocks in dollars, but bear markets in UK, European or Japanese stocks in local currency?
735 2018-08-15 17:43:19 I agree with your sentiment. In the "she who use to be obeyed" ISA I manage it stricter than my own limiting it to 9 or 10 good quality stocks:  currently: DTG, IGR, TEF, D4t4, HVN, PMP, XPP, SOM, BVXP: a recent silly boy who got the chop was RFX.

755 2018-08-15 17:28:55 The market is not taking today’s ER well @ToddAultIII. If the revenues we so dependent on Bitcoin, then you should stop diluting the stocks and give your shares holders a break. This is ridiculous price, investor with a common sense won’t touch your stock if this continues!
756 2018-08-15 17:28:09 Weed stocks finally went up again 
757 2018-08-15 17:27:25 This is why a coins supply =/= dilution:

The amount will always be finite. Unlike stocks, there will never be new "shares" deployed, therefore diluting the price.

THAT'S dilution. Supply of coins is just for scaling of the price. Nothing to do with rate of returns.

914 2018-08-15 16:20:33 @realDonaldTrump Trump saying tariffs leading to great trade deals, just a lie. We have NO AGREEMENTS AT THIS TIME. If there is no promise to talk or a trade agreement with China in three weeks , stocks markets will plunge.
915 2018-08-15 16:20:29 The greatest misconception that causes people to avoid the stock market (to their detriment) is that it is equally possible for a stock to go to 0 (-100%) as it is to double (+100%). In reality, stocks are biased to grow, and risks over the longest term are small.

924 2018-08-15 16:18:45 I don't understand why the penalize the sell by giving you 50% on return. The point of stocks is buy low/sell high right? 
I wish we could buy b4 too. We should have some perks for watching the feeds.
925 2018-08-15 16:18:24 Bonds are moving better today Retail sales came in a little hotter than expected today. Turkey’s economy, however, is causing stocks to move worse. This is offsetting the good retail Sales report and holding up the bond market from moving worse.

1011 2018-08-15 15:49:17 I think Robinhood treats your money like a bank would, investing and earning interest on it for profit.

1043 2018-08-15 15:38:24 Sister Nancy, that's what the donors want! Social Security is such a massive drain on the defense budget, and the wealthy who rule America would rather have their defense stocks strong. That, and spending money on the non-wealthy is kind of a waste. #TheWordOfWOD #WealthRules

1047 2018-08-15 15:37:36 When bear markets actually start, often times individual stocks have already broken down hard and mass deterioration is well underway. For example when the 2008 bear started to become "obvious", many stocks started to roll over and saw severe deterioration in late 2007

1060 2018-08-15 15:33:15 we're doing a similar strategy with ETH as we do with stocks, just hold for a few years and see if it goes up steadily. I think crypto prices are correcting and everything was super overvalued. Unlike Bitcoin which is super shady to me, ETH has at least signs of stability

1064 2018-08-15 15:31:50 Its all tied to imports being up by 1 MM B/d, pretty simple stuff. Just a shuffling of inventories around the world, nothing more, nothing less. So, to put it in your terms, "world commercial stocks, outside of the US, dropped a whopping 6.8 Mb".

I will wait to see if there's any volume selling when London/Europe leaves.  Bears need  actual volume, not just machines moving it up and down.
1068 2018-08-15 15:30:56 well look at GDX today... sigh.  The bad advice on being long precious metals has done more damage to being long any of these "overvalued" tech stocks the past few years.

My mentor asked me, "What is the best investment?"

My response:

Real Estate 
Stocks 
Business

He said, "No"

"The best investment is yourself"

1091 2018-08-15 15:19:21 with our portfolio we diversify in stocks that are safe and steady to offset any loss like that. so, stocks like Sherwin Williams and Caterpillar for example. All stocks are down, the market went down 300 points today
1092 2018-08-15 15:19:11 Eh, stocks have done incredibly well over the last 10 (and 30) years. If you invest in a risky asset, you take the risk that its value will go down sometimes.
1093 2018-08-15 15:18:45 Oh indeed 75% plus. Crypto is a lot more hype than actual affect though. Overall, very few are impacted. Unlike stocks and real estate bubbles which have broad implications. 
I'm sitting in crypto probably won't be the safety equivalent anytime soon.
1094 2018-08-15 15:18:23 Yes the induce are I agree. But ask any bio investor w individual bio stocks and no chance they are up nearly that high.

1164 2018-08-15 14:58:44 $HMNY is worse than a waves token. at least pickle ricks has a discrete supply, you guys realize they are issuing stocks to dump into those bids? you aint getting 6% of movie pass for $500 lmao
1165 2018-08-15 14:58:17 "turkey sanctions hit stocks"

Not every minor price fluctuation needs to be assigned a cause. Espeicaly when it's not necessarily related.
1166 2018-08-15 14:58:03 Always doubt peoples intentions pushing stocks that are already up several 100% $GFGU $FLTT
1167 2018-08-15 14:57:59 The US economy IS the stock market though.  US consumer spending is 2/3 of GDP, & Net Capital Gains+Taxable IRA distributions = 200% of annual growth in US PCE (Consumer spending).  Only decision we have left is "Do we want to print before or after stocks fall?"

1170 2018-08-15 14:57:03 Taxing stocks would be a boon for the economy. 
The top 10% own 80% of the stocks. They can afford it. 
If you buy and hold it won’t affect you. It would affect computer high speed traders, which is nonproductive economic activity.
1171 2018-08-15 14:56:55 What makes you think the cash is going to household balance sheets? Only 54% of households in the US invest in stocks (Chicago Trib) and the richest 10% of Americans own 84% of stocks.(Time magazine). If that cash transfer is taking place as you say, the rich are benefitting.

1177 2018-08-15 14:54:27 Rates are improving this AM despite a strong Retail Sales figure. Stocks are down over 300 points as worries over Turkey sent Asian equity markets tumbling. It may be a short lived rally but an opportunity to lock into a lower rate.
1178 2018-08-15 14:54:17 So you would have lost more money just dabbling in gold stocks the last 2 months, 7 years into a bear market than you would have buying some unicorn junk that fell out of favor. Like Blue Apron.
1179 2018-08-15 14:54:06 I presume all EM stocks are getting absolutely shafted but it's kinda hard for me to view them. Don't buy yet

1187 2018-08-15 14:50:06 A quick look at the standings this am:
-Emerging/Frontier markets ($FM, $SPEM) at 52 week lows, enter bear market down 20%+ from January highs.
-U.S. stocks, off ~2% from 52 week highs
-REITs ($USRT) holding strong, down 2% from 52 week highs, green today.

1206 2018-08-15 14:43:42 One of the best performing stocks today is Canopy Growth Corporation (CGC) which is a marijuana stock up around 23%. It is further evidence that the whole country is going to pot!
1207 2018-08-15 14:43:05 This seems like a good idea to me. Frankly, the current system can't last forever as it is effectively a scam. With stocks being over inflated, eventually they'll run out of tricks and it'll come crashing down.
1208 2018-08-15 14:43:04 I’m so used to bogus correlations (stocks gaining on trend they’re not actually influenced by) that I’m shocked $MGEN has gotten no bump from siRNA breakthroughs.

1220 2018-08-15 14:39:31 There was a number of recent years when "bad trading" habits was quickly rewarded. Traders who made bad entries, didn't sell cause all you had to do was HOLD: "it'll come back up!". 

But lately, I'm noticing many stocks are breaking down and not coming back, continue even lower
1221 2018-08-15 14:39:24 first i made arround 200k from trading, then started ‘buidiong position” and one moment was like i was controling arround 10% of all supply, and was issued more new stocks/loaned then my 1M shares was 1000:1 and after, price 5$ and insta down -99% to total value 250$ :))
1222 2018-08-15 14:38:43 Nothing makes me really happy these past few days i guess my happy pill is out of stocks.
1223 2018-08-15 14:38:42 My fund bought protection in $TVIX at $31.21 per share which is now trading at $42.25.

1238 2018-08-15 14:36:12 I want to point this out on a down day for the markets. On days like today, look for stocks that have relative strength to see what’s people AREN’T selling even when the market is bad. Example: Right now, Apple is down much less, percentage wise, than the market today.

1281 2018-08-15 14:26:11 Or big boys knew it’s coming and hammered the stocks down purposely and selling now

1288 2018-08-15 14:24:23 This simply underscores the necessary prudence of the USA/EU/UK COINING STIMULUS to engage in wide-scale REMEDIATION and PLASTIC REMOVAL of the world's oceans in order to preserve the USA/EU/UK maritime fish stocks, much less conserve maritime species.
1289 2018-08-15 14:24:18 Checking up on them stocks huh
1290 2018-08-15 14:24:05 Is it even worth mentioning that Pot stocks are high today?

1299 2018-08-15 14:22:00 It would have been better if you, @NicholasCoriano, had used “stocks, [there] are also” instead. ‘Their’ is possessive; ‘there’ is a pronoun or an adverb.

just seems unfair

1329 2018-08-15 14:12:00 If I wanted to be a profiteer I would have bought pot stocks. My criminal record doesn’t prevent me from doing that. It doesn’t even get in the way of numerous ways I can make money. But I’m not in it for money. 2004-2016 I knew only struggle, activism, court, prison & hard work.

1342 2018-08-15 14:08:12 Only hindsight says that though. Bitcoin was up a ton in mid 2017. Stocks, especially the FAANGS have been killing it for years. Investing is full of dead shorters who wrongly estimated the top. So buying in Jan wasn’t as much of an awful move as what people make it seem to be
1343 2018-08-15 14:07:38 This is why I sell on up days,  weak stocks,  to cut risk or short.  
You cant on a day like today.  It's too fast.

1345 2018-08-15 14:06:43 @jimcramer Utility stocks have seen a nice stealth rally since early June. Do you think this may be an indicator of something in our near future?
1346 2018-08-15 14:06:33 What I also like is that it makes fundamental sense to buy stocks that have great earnings, but the trigger, the target and the stop loss are all technical. This combo is a killer.
1347 2018-08-15 14:06:30 i am a penny stock guy. but learning these market leader stocks when penny stocks are slow is very nice

1424 2018-08-15 13:38:41 My favorite info source @NatGeo reports that the sun's core is a hydrogen bomb (i.e. hydrogen fusing to form helium) & so far, it has exploded over half of its hydrogen stocks in about 4.5B years. The remainder can only last another 5B then our Earth will be sucked in. Crazy??

1431 2018-08-15 13:37:36 There is a tax incentive to hold low-dividend stocks, harvest losses, & give to public charity later rather than now, but it's an incentive that arises from § 170's allowance of a deduction at FMV w/out payment of cap gains taxes. DAFs are not the source of that distortion 2/2

1461 2018-08-15 13:28:32 #mrs been a long wait but it feels like it’s finally turning a corner. Bachmann tr1 under 3% and it’s blue skies. Can see this making a quick dash for the 20s within weeks which would still good value. Sometimes good stocks take time but they always have their day. One to hold.
1462 2018-08-15 13:27:51 Me to forgo 10million naira? God go slap my face. One hour is even too much to upgrage my shop when i begin to order for stocks.

1468 2018-08-15 13:25:56 Everyone chasing marijuana stocks are going to find out that it can be produced for probably 1/50th the cost it currently goes for.
1469 2018-08-15 13:24:52 My point was not that stocks should have been rising in 1998 & 99. It was only to say that they did & to squash fears comparing Turkish lira today & Thai Baht in 1997. FYI, our model did NOT work in 1999! We were bears as #earnings quality was horrible & est trends weakened.
1470 2018-08-15 13:24:50 Stocks set to take a tumble this morning. I'll be discussing that with @alisonkosik on @cnni just after the opening bell at 9:30 ET.

1475 2018-08-15 13:24:06 China stocks will make a comeback, just don’t see it coming this week. Falling wedge formed in most of these China stocks. 

$iq $baba $huya
1476 2018-08-15 13:24:00 buying up shares double fisted on these destroyed stocks.  $HUYA and $IQ.  Have to love these premkt games on low volume.
1477 2018-08-15 13:23:53 Noticed overnight a mention of HK tech names getting hit. Wanted to see how Europe opened while US stocks were recovering early losses. And then China while a lot of references were made to Turkey again.

1486 2018-08-15 13:20:46 Hey bud. I’m not really fussed if I’m wrong (on the end result) I’m still significantly in the money. I still win. I have no emotional attachment to stocks. It’s a price. What is interesting here is how much attachment everyone else has. It’s a good lesson in behavioral finance.
1487 2018-08-15 13:20:43 $iq down 6.5% premarket. I doubt other China stocks like $huya $baba is going to come back this week.

1491 2018-08-15 13:19:01 I meant stocks 
1492 2018-08-15 13:18:44 $IQ and $MOMO gapping down with pretty much all of the Chinese plays. Both have room to the downside (in the case of  $IQ - $23.76 and $MOMO $33.50). However, these stocks have come down hard on their daily charts; I expect them to bounce off support today.

1498 2018-08-15 13:17:49 The #dollar resumed its rise on Wednesday, surging to new 13-month highs and upping pressure on commodities, emerging markets and global stocks, though the Turkish lira managed out to eke out a second day of gains.
1499 2018-08-15 13:17:33 Looks like you were right man, good timing. The @cbrands move today should float your boat. The pot news is better every day man, and people were playing the stocks like it was going away...in front of the legalization date too!
1500 2018-08-15 13:16:53 Nope. Ask a physicist about "entropy".

It's about knowledge. For example, knowing how stock prices have changed in the last 20 years gives you no knowledge of what stocks to buy now.

Every market is governed by major players making the moves. If you think that doesn't happen in stocks you're very mistaken.

Using your analogy every market bubble is then a ponzi, which doesn't make sense.

For the Telegram pump and dump groups, again what you're talking about is speculative markets. It happens in stocks too, but is not visible since stocks market cap is 1000x higher than crypto marketcap. Doesn't change the legitimacy or fundamentals of both the spaces.
1607 2018-08-15 12:21:31 Wrong. China is now #3. China’s economy is slowing. $2 trillion has left the Chinese stock markets and at the same time US stocks are up and the economy is booming. 

The EU is agreed to better trade. Mexico to follow very soon & then Canada. China will or crumble.

Buy backs are a fleeting thing. So stocks inherently have very less value but since they are regulated and government says that's the right way to invest in a company and hence institutional investors (who will be the major drivers) can only invest via that mechanism,

So I don't see a point of difference on these lines when we're comparing a nascent emerging & hence speculative market with a matured market.

70% - Don't agree. Stocks pretty much have value because public sees value. Dividends & gov rights, most normal ppl don't care about.

#Crypto isn't regulated, but that also brings it's own benefits. Regulations bring their own baggage and hindrance towards innovation. Also, regulations will come in time. Stocks have been there since a century now. Their regulations have kept on changing too.

Buy back was just a stability factor I was mentioning for stocks. When stocks crash, companies don't buy back either. Hence, I sorta see this as a vanity stability factor so doesn't matter whether it happens in #Crypto or not, although it's certainly possible.

1696 2018-08-15 11:36:54 @LucidInvestment when stocks tank, people go for Store of Value right? If we consider that people see altcoins as "stocks" and bitcoin as a SoV. Do you think we might only see a capitulation in altcoins and not necessary in bitcoin? See last days action.

1710 2018-08-15 11:25:45 Just had a scan down the LSE board and noticed more posts from other users that spoke negatively about #PREM have also been removed.

One user even proclaimed 'sentiment has returned...'  More like 'balance views removed..'

LSE has an biased agenda for paid companies IMHO
1711 2018-08-15 11:24:05 @CapitalOne question. With my investment account moving to E*TRADE. Is there anything I need to do before the switch? Do I cash out my stocks? Also, I have 21¢ in my account. Will that transfer?
1712 2018-08-15 11:20:39 Exactly! Right now everyone is forced to put their funds into us stocks are us dollars. Imagine the liquidity drain from us stocks once the dollar weakens and FED continues the unwind according to schedule.

1717 2018-08-15 11:16:16 No trades come without the risk of being wrong but for now the bears are in control. That will likely continue until the the dollar begins to weaken, the trade war is halted or escalated to the point where bond yields and stocks turn sharply lower.

1719 2018-08-15 11:13:39 Generally i like to stay positive about shares im invested in, and now im out of #PREM with a company with George Roach who quite clearly is a crook who basically gets free cash from investors, i feel it is important to call him out!
1720 2018-08-15 11:13:22 Something is up! Watch the big stocks today for bearish clues. I am talking about $AMZN $AAPL $GOOGL and $MSFT of course.

1725 2018-08-15 11:12:18 84% of stocks are owned by the wealthiest 10% of households, and half the households in the U.S. own zero. Unsurprising, really: the vast majority of mansions are owned by rich people, too.

1748 2018-08-15 10:55:08 @ChazandAJ WE'RE DOOMED! despite all of your hard work.  Ask stephanowski about changing taxes to include income from dividends, stocks, etc.  Weichert protected his buddies when he gave us state income tax! They don't claim that $ as income!
1749 2018-08-15 10:54:56 good thing is that all the important discussions take place in the whatsapp group.   the lse board is now just a complete ramp fest.  soon they will be posting old RHA guidance. no one takes it seriously anymore. #prem

1754 2018-08-15 10:50:54 While Developed market stocks are quiet and G10 currencies calm, we are seeing further pressure on commodities and the EM space. There is a danger that this starts to spread as the impact of a strong dollar bites.

1765 2018-08-15 10:41:16 The action in US stocks is rather bullish and one can conclude that we are in a secular bull market which can go on for years. BUT the fact that the financial world outside of the US and EU stock markets is falling apart is a huge red flag. If this low volume rally...

1767 2018-08-15 10:39:37 Interesting that you can post 1p by Christmas on the lse board and get a bunch of recommends but when you say 'placing coming' it gets removed.  I think the LSE board makes money from the companies advertising there so it doesn't allow negative comments #prem

1771 2018-08-15 10:35:14 Good call. How do you find these stocks?
1772 2018-08-15 10:34:45 agreed, I think that ETFs which have a lot of Chinese/tech stocks are also dragging down individual stocks regardless of fundamentals.
1773 2018-08-15 10:33:03 Futures are red again due to global issues regarding trade and debt. Will this weak open again be exploited to enter the rally? Gold, cryptos, bond, emerging market currencies, asian stocks are falling and you have to wonder where all that money goes too. Answer: US stocks

If so then that. If not, I would learn as much as possible about trading stocks and go that route. And eventually that money would go to school loans etc.

1933 2018-08-15 07:34:58 Foreign investors exiting Kenya equity markets (NSE) in 2018 is no surprise (offloading $180 million of stocks); it’s from combination of overvalued KES, start of squeeze in interest rate differential, rate cap woes & lack of credit flow and absence of efforts to control deficit!

2065 2018-08-15 05:03:05 @t_Muckerman Hey man! I heard you mention on Monday’s @MarketFoolery that you sold some puts on Chinese tech stocks. I recently started using options a bit. Are you involved with/trade based on @TMFOptions service? I’m considering trying that service out.

2093 2018-08-15 04:25:53 All you really need is SPX, rest of the stocks are just a curiosity to me now 
2094 2018-08-15 04:22:52 @NotOneNotTwo Your bio statement is quite true & it's amazing how many overlook it. Stocks are dumped when their underlying company or group doesn't GROW QUICKLY ENOUGH. I learned about pyramid schemes when I was an 8 or 9 year old, from my parents. That brick wall is very close.
2095 2018-08-15 04:22:38 Stocks are so confusing to me man .... like uhhggggggfffffgggghh
2096 2018-08-15 04:21:57 Up on what? I’ll be truthful, I worked on Wall St for many years. Stocks go up and down for reasons, actions, fluctuations...I don’t see how arbitrary markets conditions are real market changers...but I don’t know this at all. Thanks.
2097 2018-08-15 04:21:52 Yeah an argument could be made economy isn’t exploding because of trump. But so many other things from foreign policy, to jobs, to stocks, to security and safety, to gun legislation, to drain the swamp, to ethics, to tariffs, to immigration fairness. The list keeps going.

2099 2018-08-15 04:20:17 To some a healthy extent, He has certainly shaped my thinking. Livermore, Darvas,  W.O.N  Drunkenmiller Mark Minervini have as well.  Start by buying stocks in demand and giving yourself an opportunity to catch the big wave.

2101 2018-08-15 04:19:23 Ok...fair enough...but then buybacks across the board in general should also help your 401k assuming it is invested in blue chips or financial service stocks.
2102 2018-08-15 04:18:53 Sometimes I spitball things to see what stocks. I don’t know if that’s what I’m doing or maybe I’m just trying to manipulate people. I just don’t know. Regardless, I’m honest.

2114 2018-08-15 04:08:55 One of the many reasons stock Traders FUD blockchain

In Short Selling, there's a phenomenon called "ghosting" where the number of stocks in play actually exceed the float or maximum shares available. Brokerages do this by artificially duplicating. Blockchain would eliminate this

2123 2018-08-15 04:00:49 Could all this noise have anything to do with all the shorts that have built up, decades ago stocks used to reflect value, now it is all about manipulation (strategically and dynamically parking money between stocks then building the reqd noise), so much axn awaits, sorry no pvt!

Pakistan has been guaranteed financial backing from Beijing, senior officials said, as the incoming govt. of Imran Khan seeks to avoid going to the IMF as it resolves its foreign exchange crisis, reported the Financial Times.
2125 2018-08-15 03:59:53 It started as that. The whole rotational group concept worried KELFs, because it was rumoured that they would add members and remove members. 

However, the stocks were bought to ensure no new members get added. It also triggered the whole 'ONLY13' drama.
2126 2018-08-15 03:59:29 It's always good to see someone establishe a secure income stream with dividend stocks. Now personally at 100% cg on $MO or any stock I would have peeled some off. But that's just me.

2142 2018-08-15 03:48:07 People buy stocks because they expect the prices to rise, and the prices rise when more people buy stocks. Where does the value come from? Why do prices fall when there's bad news? If no one sold their stocks, wouldn't the prices stay the same? So many questions.

2155 2018-08-15 03:34:03 I get it, it could be a good move if stocks continued dropping. But with a long time frame... I would rather hold through a dip then try to sell and buy back lower.

2156 2018-08-15 03:33:57 I've seen some explanations for the recent drop in cannabis stocks (except for $TRST) as OCS being shelved in favor of private. But my intuition is more stores in private vs OCS so LP's would have more retail locations to supply, non? @420Inv @BettingBruiser @savestacks

2273 2018-08-15 02:15:36 Crypto was a liquidity play on central bank balance sheet. That’s why it had such a strong surge from 2013 (QE kicked into full gear) until QT this year. Crypto was the most sensitive to liquidity, next is Emerging Markets (currently happening), commodities, then HY, stocks
2274 2018-08-15 02:15:34 Disassociate the price from the value of the stock.

Look at stocks as if you are buying a part of a business, which is how it actually is. 

I guarantee this mindset shift results in more rational decisions, which inturn leads to better purchases.

2320 2018-08-15 01:45:56 USD/JPY early morning ramp (6am EST) has supported the FANG stocks for 4 months now. Every morning like clockwork when the New York trading desk open the USD gets an early morning surge and SPX ends where it needs to end.
2321 2018-08-15 01:45:03 How management communicates mistakes is very important. No one is mistake-free - as investors 40% of the stocks we buy underperform the market - and I'd be concerned about any company where shareholder communication doesn't include a candid assessment of mistakes. -- Bill Nygren

2328 2018-08-15 01:40:25 I don't do 500% gainers, I don't need to play the OTC shit stocks to hopefully catch a pump and dump.  500% gainers are PUMP AND DUMPS, period.  Been trading 20+ years, I trade REAL stocks now.  Today did $TLRY bounce, $ZUO and $AWX scalp for 10% in 10 minutes.

2351 2018-08-15 01:21:33 I'll give it to trump that the economy is in an upward turn despite his cancelling regulatory(banks/stocks/taxes  measures in place by OBAMA to prevent another economic crash... if YOU take credit for the bump, it's on YOU for the dip.

2354 2018-08-15 01:19:47 Oh goody...stocks are going great!  Glad all the mega-corps are happy with their tax cuts.  Who cares if insurance premiums are still going up (as they have every year since well before Obamacare).  Who cares if full time employees can't afford rent in most states.
2355 2018-08-15 01:19:18 Amen...S&P corrected 19.9% in Oct 2011 and about 17% in Feb 2016......so by silly outdated 20% decline definitions  there was no "official" Bear market..and yet many many stocks fell 20-30-40-50% (Apple fell 45% in 2013) ....those were wipe-out corrections by any fair definition

2357 2018-08-15 01:19:03 That in itself can be considered an ‘edge’ as well as having patience is grossly underestimated and I would even go as far as calling it an edge. Usually my solid day’s are when i trade one - two stocks 
2358 2018-08-15 01:14:54 Ok I understand, I am not very good a that. I do maybe 8 trades a month, sometimes less. So I look to see where I can get 10 to 20% in a trade in stocks that have impeccable fundamentals

2360 2018-08-15 01:14:37 Crude pricing mechanism is a bit screwed up. If US exports less crude. WTI falls even tho this crude can’t get to cushing. Crude on water falls while it has less supplies. Same with HO low stocks. Reverse with RB with high stocks

The wheat harvesting is almost over. It implies that Russia's wheat exports will be more dependant on deliveries from other regions.

2434 2018-08-15 00:01:15 Stocks is another example of how this plays out. Investors that only want to hear the good things about a company and then viciously attack any bears.
