14 2018-05-25 23:57:26 I suspect this is written by a journo who thought oil was going up for the memorial holiday as a hit piece but then price dropped.
Therefore it had to be changed to this incoherent nonsense before heading out to the Hamptons for the weekend.

36 2018-05-25 23:56:54 This disproportionately hurts the "forgotten man and woman in America." The US left the Iran deal and stopped buying Iranian oil. It's nothing Iran did or didn't do. Trump simply wanted to be able to say, "I did this."

Does it still seem like "a bad deal for America?"

#MAGA?
37 2018-05-25 23:56:39 Wow I thought my car was on its deathbed, but it turns out all I needed was an oil change, seeing that it’s been a year since I’ve had one...
38 2018-05-25 23:56:37 *curtsies* you're deserving of it my friend.
39 2018-05-25 23:56:36 The banking system in Iran is a true house of cards. It relies almost completely on the EU countries and its oil. boycott the oil and Iran is in deep trouble. They can pay the terrorists they support, oh help Iranian citizens. Watch and she which they choose.

Wait until the babyboomers all retire and those jobs that Trump tells us are good,like coal & oil & gas,you think these kids want those jobs or tech jobs ? In 5 yrs America will be in unbelievable trouble as far as labour is concerned.Backwards thinking.
47 2018-05-25 23:55:14 @CountryCrock  made with plants?!? I've squeezed the heck out of my veggies.  Not one drop of oil.  How about plants and industrial processes.
48 2018-05-25 23:54:49 Iran is a major producer of oil as well. Was there something recent in the news involving them? Nah...
49 2018-05-25 23:54:45 some of Syria's best oil/gas reserves are in Golan Heights, which Israel and western companies are very anxious to steal.
50 2018-05-25 23:54:42 neither @uber and @lyft pays no penny for our car´s gas, tires, oil changes, shock absorbers... for a ride earnings split like 60 - 70% for them and  30% for the drivers
51 2018-05-25 23:54:37 We don't need love or strength. We need oil.
52 2018-05-25 23:54:29 #Russia, if you're listening, the province of British Columbia #Canada is going to need oil and gas very soon... ! 
53 2018-05-25 23:54:04 Really? I hate wen I wash my hair it feels so dry my hair takes 4evr to get oily, just depends on the person, ever since I cut my hair I barely wash it 1-2 a week and i nvr seen it grow this fast, u should at least try going 2 days!! Natural oil is good!
54 2018-05-25 23:53:59 Milk ATMs,cooking oil ATMs next thing pap! Nyanya ATMs ... sukuma ATMs.
55 2018-05-25 23:53:52 When someone says bankrupting the oil companies is impractical, I hear human survival is impractical. Do not go gently into that good night. We should fight tooth and nail against the oil companies that are driving us to oblivion in our rolling steel cages.
56 2018-05-25 23:53:35 Just now the oil climbed to 80D things will change eventually. I am sure u can see the reserve has improve drastically. Governors refused to save yes why didn't the FG save their own share? NOI said that lack of political will to save was the reason why Nigeria got into recession
57 2018-05-25 23:53:23 I think there will be more of a Northern Irish solution. A mix of GBP and EUR currencies used in Scotland. Once oil is being traded in Euros and GBP volatility will mean unless Scotland launches their own currency, Scotland will end up using EURO as the accepted currency.
58 2018-05-25 23:53:18 Great info on electric ships but why the need to diss oil and the billions of dollars it provides to the Canadian economy and will continue to provide for the foreseeable future.
59 2018-05-25 23:53:09 Unless you have a #BrexitUnityPlan you're selling snake oil. Will you be engaging with Leavers and addressing their concerns? I hope so.
60 2018-05-25 23:53:04 If you actually read the emails, it was the Dems that burned Bernie. Of course, he would endorse HRC. He's not a POS like DJT.

79 2018-05-25 23:50:24 Reality is that a snake oil salesman is in the WH because he made a deal with our enemies.

82 2018-05-25 23:49:37 It not gonna “cut it in California?” Uhhhh well since I’m already payin over $4 a gallon now the only thing I see “not cutting it,” is why you politicians have never protected the consumers from all this oil company gas price gouging! FOUR DOLLARS A GALLON!?!?

93 2018-05-25 23:47:55 All I know, is we haven't seen a pay raise, that you promised.Gas prices are skyrocketing,even though the oil companies just got a massive tax cut, and it's because of you pulling out of the Iran deal.I guess we are just supposed to take one for the team, as the rich get richer!

102 2018-05-25 23:46:38 If only our economic managers in Nigerian are proactive, news about crude oil prices fluctuation shouldn't bother anyone if only our economy is positioned to be immuned to vagaries of market by not being susceptible to them.
103 2018-05-25 23:46:37 Now that is a fine compliment!  Much obliged!
104 2018-05-25 23:45:52 Gas prices are not in the purvue of POTUS. They are all market driven primarily by oil producing countries we still really on to supply oil to the US. Also states tax on gas being raised is a big part of it.
105 2018-05-25 23:45:48 The industrial revolution started with wood and water power.  Coal was turned to only after the wood was running out.  The increasing use of increasingly dense forms of energy (Coal, oil, nuclear) has been the fuel for our global prosperity though.

141 2018-05-25 23:40:44 Clove oil was one of my suggestions, but another is gargling with a (very dilute) solution of TCP. It tastes disgusting and makes your mouth shrivel, but it can dull the pain. Works for tonsil and throat pain too.

148 2018-05-25 23:39:51 @KKeefer120 if your doing 3 20 plus min. Motos should you use synthetic semi syn or what let’s here the break down. Thanks man oil has gotten so advanced possibly a test on this with oil breakdown tests from lab ??

150 2018-05-25 23:38:59 I was a varsity tennis player. My friends were all soccer players. We loved our Yu-Gi-Oh! Just about everyone at the Maryland frat played Magic the Gathering. I tagged along with them to a tournament one weekend. You can't be that popular and only attract one crowd.
151 2018-05-25 23:38:55 @Oil_vampire seems to be the type: I got mine, screw you.
152 2018-05-25 23:38:51 Ha!  That’s not early....I will be watching while I wait for Premier Subaru to let me in as the first “express” oil change customer of the day.  
153 2018-05-25 23:38:44 "My bf eats motor oil" does that work

155 2018-05-25 23:38:04 Now Playing: Barbara Mandrell - The Midnight Oil
156 2018-05-25 23:37:56 To make it really bad, it wasn't even imported oil, it was that disgusting Alberta variety.
157 2018-05-25 23:37:37 I lost my satellite lock some time ago :( Don't know where I am now and I need some oil, 5w30 will do.
158 2018-05-25 23:37:32 Yes, you and Tillerson are laughing about how easy it was to raise the price of oil.
159 2018-05-25 23:37:24 There's a special kind of loneliness that creeps in when you are at a group event alone. My freshman year of high school, I would go to a Yu-Gi-Oh! tournament with my friends almost every weekend. The stereotype with trading card games that its just basement dwellers that play.
160 2018-05-25 23:37:24 Oil companies....
161 2018-05-25 23:37:11 Oil operations عفوا *
162 2018-05-25 23:37:05 This week we finally decided to go down to 1 car! It was completely paid off but the total yearly cost was still over $3,000 a year ($250+ a month):

$120 insurance
$60 parking
$40 gas
$5 registration 
+ oil changes, tires & maintenance.

At $3k*25, that’s $75k less to save!
163 2018-05-25 23:36:48 ぽはよぉございます♪
164 2018-05-25 23:36:35 Southern area oil department , طبعا هذي تبع دائرة الdrilling  اغلب شغلهم سايتاات او رقوق بر او بحر  والله يوفقك 
165 2018-05-25 23:36:35 Why did they go to a chiropractor for a gastro issue? Sounds like pure snake oil to me.
166 2018-05-25 23:36:34 SO I guess you're stupid about oil too.. Useless #Democrats regulations DRIVE PRICES UP!! @realDonaldTrump
167 2018-05-25 23:36:32 WRONG, Iran is the 4th largest producer of oil in the world.  Pulling out of the nuclear deal and making trade with iran near impossible is DIRECTLY related to increased gas prices. try reading.
168 2018-05-25 23:36:31 You can tell people who were not fed spoonfuls of castor oil as kids

175 2018-05-25 23:35:50 おはぽーーーん
176 2018-05-25 23:35:50 Pruitt needs security b/c people hate what he's doing (or not doing) to the environment. He's  best buds w/oil & gas & is willing to let them pollute to keep profits higher.
177 2018-05-25 23:35:40 Aaa penat nya sental muka guna bio oil ni
178 2018-05-25 23:35:37 Another power outage. Thank you #hydroQuébec for the reliability in my sector (fontainebleau, Blainville)!!!  I think I m already due for oil change on my Generator (every 50hrs of use)

- Rana ayub and Rabish get death threat
- Media houses are Hindutva apologists #MediaOnSale
- Oil price attack
@narendramodi ji will you survive these attacks by opposition?

195 2018-05-25 23:34:01 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
196 2018-05-25 23:33:50 Try blistering shishito sweet Japanese peppers, a delicious summer treat. We like the way the Spanish and Italians blister, olive oil, no soy sauce. 

Oh, and do not forget the chilled Cava Brut Reserve or Franciacorta 
197 2018-05-25 23:33:34 It's fine win just oil too. And fake hot dogs don't usually have casing. It's shaped... whatever they use, soy or mushroom or whatever they use. 
198 2018-05-25 23:33:24 R u ok w/this bec there’s no wall & ‘these’ people don’t deserve to be here? There is NEVER an excuse for cruelty. And THIS is cruelty to INNOCENT CHILDREN. 1475 of them have been “lost” & possibly trafficked. WH has said that ICE doesn’t have to save reports of sexual abuse.
199 2018-05-25 23:33:22 Car wash is done. Car is vacuumed and cleaned up. Wiped down surfaces. Now for an oil change. Heck yes adulting!
200 2018-05-25 23:33:15 @chigrl so your predicting oil prices to go up?
201 2018-05-25 23:33:11 Gas is over $3.00 a gallon in parts of the country.......what deals are you working on regarding gas prices?
Or, is your plan for the American people to use their extra tax money  to cover the rise....in that case the oil industry(great deal for them) just gets more tax dollars.
202 2018-05-25 23:32:57 Every time you get an oil change some other shit need changing. Give me my keys sir and don’t suggest $400 in filter changes and some brake fluid
203 2018-05-25 23:32:38 Thank you, I really appreciate your thoughts!  Any suggestions would be welcome; atm my routine is Corsodyl, sometimes clove oil, sometimes Bonjela but I will try anything at this point!
204 2018-05-25 23:32:35 Given my argument is to move away from oil as an industry and therefore the need to transport oil, I highly doubt they would disagree with me
205 2018-05-25 23:32:33 Nails done.
Now I just need good food, some wine, and a nice bath with the new aromatherapy bath oil I’m releasing next month for RITUAL.ATL. 
206 2018-05-25 23:32:23 If they had oil Tump would be warming up the Tanks.

211 2018-05-25 23:32:00 They should draft I don’t trust chia in any trade the oil makes
212 2018-05-25 23:31:45 Looking for a good investment? Invest 40 minutes of your time in veggies at 400f with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Perfect crunch, every time.
213 2018-05-25 23:31:19 Yeah #1 oil producer in the world now should be $2.95. Just back from Italia $5.50 there so America is Great Again!  We win
214 2018-05-25 23:31:19 @NIAbbot @LBC Gabapentin is NOT an opioid. It’s an anticonvulsant used in nerve pain & epilepsy.  Smoking Cannabis is known to induce psychosis over long term use .however oil is the safer option . Great show
215 2018-05-25 23:31:18 Bring back the spoils system.
216 2018-05-25 23:31:15 For someone to pop every bone in my essential oil diffuser.
217 2018-05-25 23:31:06 Today at work I burned myself. The oil from the grill splashed on the arm where my smiley tattoo is and it burns @ItsBobbyMares 
218 2018-05-25 23:31:02 Those places are terrible and will scam you any chance they get. If they ever suggest anything beyond an oil change just tell them thanks and you’ll take it to your regular mechanic
219 2018-05-25 23:30:57 Anyone good oil tycoon investors!
Please give me money!
220 2018-05-25 23:30:35 Sometimes I wish I had stayed home, gone to BC, gotten pregnant, dropped out, got a min wage job or became a housewife, engaged to the baby daddy who works either at a warehouse or the oil fields,,,,

Bc all I want in life rn is a dog and a child.
221 2018-05-25 23:30:17 guess i need coconut oil but i ain’t leaving the house tonight i’ve had enough
222 2018-05-25 23:30:08 Your handing out waivers and on top of that gas prices are 3.25 trump. Get your rich friends to start producing oil. We will pay you now and we will get it back later. We know the game.

226 2018-05-25 23:29:43 They are deployed under false pretenses.  It's not terrorists.. it's Money and greed used by Trump for Israel bankers and Rothschild wanting Syria oil..
I sorry for these men and women used by power to gain what they want.
227 2018-05-25 23:29:37 I hope you maintain your good health and fortune. Karma will remember if you don't.
228 2018-05-25 23:29:12 lol sure.  Or a snake oil salesman.  I pick the latter.
229 2018-05-25 23:29:10 If any of the saints out there are missing oil from your lamps... I’m sure I have it all... cuz the way Ling Le has oiled me down.... Y’all pray I don’t slip out of my shoes!!!!

233 2018-05-25 23:28:35 Trying CBD oil for the first time today. So far  #CBD #cbdoil
234 2018-05-25 23:28:29 Ok but why? And is Kanye just in it because he’s oil with pusha?
235 2018-05-25 23:28:16 Never plan to have an Alexa. No need for it and it’s headaches. Think fracking is contributing to earthquakes and other issues. Plus oil drilling and other processes where they are injecting high pressure gasses into the earth.
236 2018-05-25 23:27:51 For the first, I felt so good talking about the share markets, oil prices, SST with my director
237 2018-05-25 23:27:47 i don’t even know she said she made it like that cus she didn’t wanna use oil??? lol

楽しみです
244 2018-05-25 23:27:02 I forgot, tbh. But that was probably because the soup tasted great regardless. Also, I try to hoard my palm oil because it's expensive in this part of the world.
245 2018-05-25 23:26:26 Mom loading chili pepper oil onto her plate: "Gonna burn my ass"
246 2018-05-25 23:26:24 Probably means you haven't changed the oil in that Honda for 10,000 miles.
247 2018-05-25 23:26:23 It’s not the dems. It’s the people... u have to defend ur country. Boycott; NRA supporting organizations, NFL, oil and gas. Speak; outside the Twitter verse. Vote.
248 2018-05-25 23:26:13 ?????? Cannabinoid oil DOES NOT have THC’s people!!!!!!!!
249 2018-05-25 23:26:04 This weekend you will learn to accelerate the realization of qi gong benefits by applying special essential oil blends to acupuncture points
250 2018-05-25 23:26:02 Non-binary potatoes taking a jacuzzi in hot oil have no sexual identity? Huh. Who knew?
251 2018-05-25 23:25:52 Start investing in oil
252 2018-05-25 23:25:52 I know what it is to walk in the valley of the "shadow" of death...and I now truly know what it is to be led beside the still waters. The rejuvenation process is almost complete.

YOU will never know the cost of my oil.... but now I do...my GOD.

Thank you Jesus....
253 2018-05-25 23:25:42 Lical? Is that a combo of local & liberal.  Hogg did no such thing. Get over yourselves with your little bully mob. You are the problem 100%.
254 2018-05-25 23:25:37 Hey @NCAA , it's time to fire this Mark Emmert clown and all of those high up. Slapping school's hands for major violations and ignoring multiple sexual assault/violent crimes... Oh, but a kid using cbd oil for health or signing his/her own name for $, fuck that shit, right!?
255 2018-05-25 23:25:36 ยินดีคร้า

258 2018-05-25 23:25:12 Need to find some oil to make my hair grow
259 2018-05-25 23:25:06 Sauté in a bit of olive oil with some good salt! Can add a squeeze of lemon. They’re so good.
260 2018-05-25 23:25:05 Boatloads of money is what that means, like oil tanker boats

265 2018-05-25 23:24:07 2. Fossil fuel companies have actually fought a constant, stealth campaign against @elonmusk for years. Even the other automakers that hate him are beholden to gas/oil (Ford recently announced it would almost exclusively sell gas guzzlers). I'd get fed up with it too #ElonMusk
266 2018-05-25 23:23:56 @LBC My aunt was given 7 months to live 4 years ago. Her stomach tumor has  started to shrink  and  condition has stabilised using cannabis oil and bitter apricot kernels.  She refused chemo due to side affects. Her doctors just told her to keep doing what you're doing.
267 2018-05-25 23:23:47 Gee, that seems like the same reason a lot of them send snake oil salesmen like Franklin Graham and Joel Osteen their hard earned money.
268 2018-05-25 23:23:33 NZEs, if it gained traction as a target, would help clarify the debate in Canada about pipelines and oil production. As it is now the govt is claiming that pipelines (and by extension, more oil production) are needed to meet its Paris commitments.
269 2018-05-25 23:23:02 @Joe_Rohde Was trying to find the answer online but couldn't. What company was the Tree of Life oil platform base purchased from?
270 2018-05-25 23:22:57 @EasyMoneyDot We can't work for free. But our oil changes aren't expensive. Stop by for the maintenance work.
271 2018-05-25 23:22:50 You might want to tell that to your President, who wanted Obama firing because of gas/oil prices in 2012.
272 2018-05-25 23:22:39 I really just put olive oil on my lips since my vaseline was stolen
273 2018-05-25 23:22:38 Which trade deals? Is it bout bump stocks, Russian oil, porn stars, greenhouse gases, birth certificates, Nobel peace prizes, jails for political opponents, massive lie factory... Which deals?
274 2018-05-25 23:22:30 Kendrick raps like he’s frying plantain while he’s on the phone and he scared of the oil splashing on him fuck outta here
275 2018-05-25 23:21:56 Just what my dry frizzy hair needs, I adore coconut oil

282 2018-05-25 23:21:10 Gasoline is the only thing in us which is cheaper than it is in India. We can have cheaper gas and costlier bread and butter. Sort your priorities. And even in texas the bed of oil production it has risen more than 30percent, walk more use buses that's the only solution
283 2018-05-25 23:21:10 How about cutting the 100 mil $ aid to Honduras and use it to repatriate their citizens? 
I got bills to pay without supporting S.A. poor
284 2018-05-25 23:20:37 Yes, as in many parts of the U.K. sea defences have been provided by EU regional development funding, we can appreciate in this latest nonsense from Gove snake oil at its finest...
285 2018-05-25 23:20:29 I told the amazon rep that it’s still leaking oil from something cracked on it and told me that UPS doesn’t care if the item is leaking oil out of the box. I contacted ups directly and they will not pickup nor ship a package that is leaking hazardous liquids.
286 2018-05-25 23:20:27 Hahahaha. Chal bari de de. Olive oil lga k lu ga uski. Yaad kray gi.
287 2018-05-25 23:20:06 I already sent them a email and had a chat. What bothers me is I received a improperly packaged pressure washer that left a nice large oil stain the size of the box bottom on my front stone steps to my house. They told me that I’ll need to go out on my own buy a new box.
288 2018-05-25 23:20:00 LMFAO...

1st... you only cancelled the Iranian Nuclear Agreement for Russia so they can move there oil freely because of the sanctions...

2nd... You are the laughing stock of the world. Because of you the US is untrustworthy, unprofessional, unpredictable, unstable and racist!
289 2018-05-25 23:19:54 Of course. Peterson just debated a post-modern professor and a preacher. Describes Dyson perfectly. He even sounded like a snake oil salesman. I'm sure you're not going to pay attention to Petersons actual message or lectures but none of it resembles what these hit pieces portray

291 2018-05-25 23:19:48 Coconut Oil
292 2018-05-25 23:19:47 Yes, but why wouldn't you extract it from oil if you had a clean technique?
293 2018-05-25 23:19:37 Use cooking oil to peel it off and set it free far away. Far away as in like, in a mouse cage at my house.
294 2018-05-25 23:19:35 Also remember you don’t want drilling off your coast so we are dependent on foreign oil

298 2018-05-25 23:19:03 Oil prices crashing today.  It's @realDonaldTrump 's fault. 
299 2018-05-25 23:18:18 Hmm, I wonder what country is dependent on oil exports to support its oligarchs and benefits most from high oil prices?
300 2018-05-25 23:18:13 aye am pro H as the next crop and oil for transport , though there is other ways to create it - google hydrogen house. For a country to do it think large scale , using off peak power , cars as fuel cells for the home to remove peak demand spikes too.

Hydrogen from water.
301 2018-05-25 23:17:45 Tofu would be better . You can get it crunchy in oil in fry pan. Yummy
302 2018-05-25 23:17:29 I’ve struggled with acne off and on for years. I’ve now simplified my routine, oil cleanser, retin A, a plant based toner and super moisturizing moisturizer. My skin is better than ever
303 2018-05-25 23:17:28 All I know is, journalists are to Trump as oil is to water.
304 2018-05-25 23:17:24 Dear Chavistas: #Venezuela collapse is not a result of oil, US, fascism, venal opposition, 2002 coup, OAS, or man on the moon. It's you.

306 2018-05-25 23:17:18 Donald had to pay Putin somehow. He can’t ditch the Magnitsky Act or lift sanctions. The best he could do is destabilize markets and cause the price of oil to rise. That helps Putin’s economy bigly.

312 2018-05-25 23:16:47 Self imposed hiatus from social media. Too much pain: school shootings, trophy hunting, wolf and bear hunts, deforestation & dying apes, loss of ice & starving animals, ICE, oil spills, and the trashy sh*t shows in the WH and the Senate causing the atrocities. It’s too much.

324 2018-05-25 23:14:51 No we sell our excess domestic oil to European countries to under cut Russia's dominant economic tool.  OIL.  Russia is the #1 supplier of oil to the EU... and we take their power and money away when we supply Poland, and other EU Nations!

333 2018-05-25 23:13:13 not much. Vaguely savory. I combine mine with MCT oil to hit that fat intake % and when its blended together it becomes a froth (thats how you know it has sufficient collagen) thats kinda like drinking a fatty, savory, cloud with more smell than taste.

340 2018-05-25 23:12:17 Any time you are tapping up psychopathic oil sheiks for millions of dollars for your charitable foundation, they must have some expectation of a transactional nature.

348 2018-05-25 23:11:22 I heard radio story about the increase. Reporter said part of the reason is increased oil prices because "oil goes into gasoline."

350 2018-05-25 23:10:52 @seanhannity #Gas
Why did gas prices spike?
Are they foriegn owned suppliers paying tariffs?
Are oil companies not sharing their tax savings?
Is it hidden taxes on wholesalers?

368 2018-05-25 23:08:38 This is a list of top world exporters.  This list DOESN'T even count our DOMESTIC oil production... only the excess oil that we exported to Europe last year.

374 2018-05-25 23:07:31 If you read my other tweets, I’m against prolific waste of oil and part of our long term plan must be a strict conservation strategy as well as control who we sell this Dilbit to & what it will be used for. We must act as a global environmental steward

403 2018-05-25 23:03:40 Everything about this tweet makes me feel small. How will my background of cheap wine, an Ikea stool, and a Larry Walker figurine ever live up to that backsplash, matching salt and pepper grinders, and whatever artisanal olive oil that is back there. It probably has herbs in it!
404 2018-05-25 23:03:33 Because I moved out from oil and gas just because this is the future. I have two engineering degrees and have enough working experience to see through that. If this was not feasible, I would be putting my effort somewhere else. This is unstoppable

411 2018-05-25 23:02:42 Europe is a nice directional pointer. Denser cities, more walking & transit. Here, a lot less oil & coal by the 20th C. As it is, my Mom's family (poor) owed survival to coal in the heat/cooking stove in the 40's.

429 2018-05-25 23:01:02 About six years ago, I got to hear him speak and he told us a story about how...and I wish I had video of this, he wanted to export oil to poor South American countries by....sending the oil up into a satellite that beams it down into individual generators in south America.

438 2018-05-25 23:00:02 I dont think you appreciate what US oil production will do. 11 million bpd is close, with 12 not THAT far behind if the specs keep peddling narratives and pushing it once they see what they think is a "buy the dip" opportunity. Think 50 for a sec. And US producers are hedged.

440 2018-05-25 22:59:59 Opium, oil, minerals,bases, our empire chugs merrily on..our military is fighting wars for the enrichment of a few not for our free-dumbs...
441 2018-05-25 22:59:56 I once had one with garlic oil, onions, Parmesan and mozzarella in marina di Massa in Italy and I loved it. But when I get pizza in Germany it’s too damn dry without tomato sauce
442 2018-05-25 22:59:54 I just wanna know why the mechanic who drove my car into the slot for my oil change just dead ass sat in my car for like 3 minutes.
443 2018-05-25 22:59:52 I hate split days off. I feel like I have no off days when that happens because I have to do literally everything in one day. Like today, I had to grocery shop, laundry, oil change, and clean. I don’t even get time to do anything I want to do. 
444 2018-05-25 22:59:49 Big oil always get their way. It's rather sad.
445 2018-05-25 22:59:34 So @jacindaardern who had been working on getting rid of Oil and Gas behind the scene since Dec - suddenly delays a meeting to accept a “pr set up” Greenpeace petition on getting rid of Oil and Gas and then just before Chogm without consulting with prof or industry announces it?
446 2018-05-25 22:59:32 pretty sure America would invade my momma's curry if they found out its oil content
447 2018-05-25 22:59:18 OF COURSE SO HE CAN MAKE THE OIL CORPORATIONS RICHER!!!
448 2018-05-25 22:59:08 The best diet for all men imo is high in vegetables, moderate fruit, lean cuts of hormone-free meats, eggs, nuts and seeds esp flax, Chia and hemp seeds, olive oil, walnuts avocado, low in Dairy. Cut down on alcohol sugar and caffeine and up the water

450 2018-05-25 22:58:57 Walked into Bath & Body Works looking for coconut body spray, and walked oht with 3 sprays, 2 lotions and some body oil... gets me every damn time
451 2018-05-25 22:58:41 Also oil change and tire rotation.
452 2018-05-25 22:58:37 Sometimes you need to just pause and pay attention to what you're doing.

Like when you grab a container thinking it's coconut oil and you finger huge glob and apply generously to your inner thighs to thwart chub rub and it actually ends up being Vicks Vapor Rub.

453 2018-05-25 22:58:23 Not bad, Melissa, but I would nix the baguette, biscuits, and butter, and add wholemeal bread, olive oil, and salad. (I'm over 60, and require the roughage.)
454 2018-05-25 22:58:22 Build the damn wall.
455 2018-05-25 22:58:21 A massive chunk of turkey should be given to Syria for their Edogan's support of the oil thievery of ISIS, as a large chuck of Israel also should be taken for their support of terrorism too, its the only fair thing to do. In fact all western states that supported #ISIS owe #Syria

464 2018-05-25 22:56:49 sell this snake oil to your voters cause no one else will buy your shit. deception and distraction, that is all you can offer.
465 2018-05-25 22:56:06 I wonder how much OPEC oil producers paid @joshfoxfilm to tweet this.
466 2018-05-25 22:55:38 Shit,that booty thicker than crude oil! 
467 2018-05-25 22:55:30 Don’t even get me started on how @VinnieFavale screwed you and Dana out of the Newlywed game. Oil and Vinegar is not vinaigrette.
468 2018-05-25 22:55:26 Cannibus oil doesn't get a person "high". It is a miracle drug for people having seizures, epilepsy, chronic pain. Using this greatly improves their lives. And those that love them.

471 2018-05-25 22:55:06 It doesn’t prove anything.
Much of this is due to oil. Which is a diminishing revenue source. And Scotland spends more than the rUK running basic services. 
Read the rest of the article you linked to. Read the report out today. Indy would be tough going (at least initially)
472 2018-05-25 22:55:04 Watching a grown man oil himself before he goes to workout is by far the lamest shit I’ve ever seen in my entire life
473 2018-05-25 22:54:47 Don't patronize me there are enough stupid people that don't understand everything has oil in it

The deceptive greed only spoils,
Mentally our blood, forever boils.
475 2018-05-25 22:54:41 Traditional news media is losing its grip on its long tradition of distorting the truth for the masses. As with the pending death of big OIL and big ICE, no dinosaur goes down without a fight.

484 2018-05-25 22:53:32 The Christian Right/ oil sands combo in Alberta is terrifying. We are all waiting to see how Ontario votes in two weeks. The polls are swinging left. It will be tight though.
485 2018-05-25 22:53:09 Isabel, call it Spanish if u want, natural/historic evolution made Castilian be called Spanish, and u can use them as synonyms. The same way that toscano became Italian, and Langue d’Oil became French (and Bretons still call it French, tiens, tiens )
486 2018-05-25 22:53:08 I either use shea moisture Jamaican black castor oil leave in conditioner or i use their curl enhancing smoothie. Both work good.

How was your day? 
496 2018-05-25 22:52:04 It seems to be an oil to allow the transducer to maintain contact with the housing which in turn makes contact with the gel that is placed on the object getting the ultrasound.  I read the article but didn't read the details of the project as closely as I would have liked.
497 2018-05-25 22:51:55 just chopped up some tomatoes and fresh basil from the garden to mix w olive oil + garlic and put on toasted whole grain bread for some bruschetta  tastes like summer

But some just keep asking for more and more.
499 2018-05-25 22:51:51 It's so easy to communicate with the parents via @Schoology and @Seesaw. We put out a message and our Ps responded with lots of oil!
500 2018-05-25 22:51:47 Only if we state own the oil and raise income tax to offset the spend of it
501 2018-05-25 22:51:39 I hate going to get my oil changed, damn people always trying to sell me all this other crap like I’m rich or something 
502 2018-05-25 22:51:32 Yang aku tau sih kalau yg jerawatan itu kan salah satu faktornya itu mibyak berlebih ya. Nah kemungkinan besar yg buat acne itu ya dia gimana biar si oil itu ke kontrol

504 2018-05-25 22:51:09 Never pass up an opportunity to help anyone, I just helped a young man at the gas station tonight take his oil fill cap off, OMG It was on there good.
505 2018-05-25 22:51:09 Trump broke the Iranian deal and imposed sanctions on one of the largest oil producers.  I call it stupidity but you can call it violent intervention if you want.
506 2018-05-25 22:51:01 ... Instead they have the gall to deny this kid with extreme talent the right to play at his dream school because his medicine is a plant based oil that stop his seizures from reoccurring.

509 2018-05-25 22:50:46 He also told the guy to start a business selling (randomly- guy doesn't paint) oil paintings online, & then told a story about his childhood dog, so I guess the guy is fixed now. Can't decide which of the two is a worse narcissist. Alex Jones is definitely more mentally unstable
510 2018-05-25 22:50:40 Republican controlled. They own the oil and make billions.
511 2018-05-25 22:50:24 u can't reason with these types, oil and gas will continue to be King for power for decades, I say anybody or doesn't like the resource, turn it off in Nov thru May

513 2018-05-25 22:49:57 i mean its very honorable to fight for oil, imagine if the prices were to skyrocket, would you feel better if you had some personel alive and a lot civilians less unhappy about their misery?
514 2018-05-25 22:49:57 Germany is with China now, France is with Russia now. Oil prices are up 50% since you took office and I'm paying an extra US$ for gas and will pay more taxes this year.

517 2018-05-25 22:49:55 This is only a couple hundred metres or so away from the end of the pipeline, and probably 5 metres west of the edge of the property at the tank farm, where oil is stored on Burnaby Mountain.

521 2018-05-25 22:49:22 All these damn facts getting in the way of a perfectly good fascism party. How much money the feds giving in oil subsidies? How much money/jobs are the US losing in not having any stake in the green energy industry? Who’s picking up the bill for the uninsured patients?
522 2018-05-25 22:49:11 I give my 13 yr old dog CBD Oil & it helps!
523 2018-05-25 22:49:04 Thanks. A number of points have been made that Saudi and Russia were worried about trump releasing crude from the spr to counter higher oil prices.
524 2018-05-25 22:48:59 オイルだからってオイルツイートばかりな訳じゃないぞ。油ツイートもするよ。
525 2018-05-25 22:48:59 That's why nigeria has remained  a mono-economy & oil our only source of Income! 
But wen it comes to elections, every region struggles to produce the highest votes!
526 2018-05-25 22:48:52 There absolutely is. It just most people write it wrong. Its peak (Price X) oil. we have not reached Peak $100 WTI oil but we clearly have reached Peak $40 WTI oil. Peak meaning demand at that price over any meaningful real world time will permanently exceed supply over time.
527 2018-05-25 22:48:34 Land is just as much of a finite resource as oil or coal and not every place that needs electricity has an open, flat area nearby.

531 2018-05-25 22:48:08 Also since it's summer there's a greater demand for oil causing prices to rise. It's always usually higher in the summer since more people are out and about. Additionally, inventories are lower this year than last so probably why we see higher prices

537 2018-05-25 22:47:24 @JasonGregor Don't know how coaches will impact Oil, but won't matter if roster isn't upgraded. Am I an idiot to think Rick Nash might be perfect here? 33 but still skates, & far better than Lucic, Rattie, Puls, other options. Big vet, might bring leadership. 2 yrs, 3.5 mill
538 2018-05-25 22:47:10 Suspect they don't want to have children anymore. One of those jobs better left to migrants that Irish won't do.

542 2018-05-25 22:46:30 Your oil stuff really does look great!
543 2018-05-25 22:46:23 Yet, you want our oil to go to countries with questionable human rights records.

Why is it frown apon?  

Extremely better than  other things that are on the streets.
548 2018-05-25 22:45:36 (2/2) strenght in that. THEN I realized what was happening, that the industries Musk was disrupting (oil, gas, auto) were using their surrogates in the media to attack Musk and Tesla. And that is how the press in this country works, especially business press.

554 2018-05-25 22:44:51 Yes and it didn’t work bc THC is fat soluble, which means this beverage will need some kind of emulsifier to keep the drug/oil mixture suspended in it.
555 2018-05-25 22:44:24 @realDonaldTrump Dictator Maduro stages sham election, expels U.S. diplomats, arrests of military officers, completely takes over Oil industry.  If America cares for democracy in Venezuela WHY is Citgo still in the U.S.?!  Citgo must be sanctioned and removed from U.S.!
556 2018-05-25 22:44:15 Harvard has prospered from foundations begun by globalist and network of legacy wealth. It is home of the papers of Maurice Strong, a Canadian oil man who procured some of his most useful help from Harvard classrooms in 1960’s. He recruited them, but not for their ethics.

558 2018-05-25 22:44:04 Mmm I was somehow able to recreate the feta omellete I had at wi/mpys cuz omg I had spinach n feta omellete and it was so delicious. I think it's olive oil and specific feta cheese cuz I tasted new feta we had and it was similar to the one I tasted
559 2018-05-25 22:43:54 It’s also worth mentioning that O&G are NOT the main reason boreal forests are cut, that award goes to wood and paper products. So again sue, your claim that boreal deforestation is a result of oil is again, utterly false. Keep graspering though...

565 2018-05-25 22:43:22 It has a miniscule amount. Some CBD Oil comes from certain strains of hemp so there is next to no THC. The strains of marijuana used for the oil is breed to maximize cannabidol and minimize THC.
566 2018-05-25 22:42:46 Nope, not the issue at hand.  I can't buy Canadian oil because it all gets exported.  Stop using serious issues for your oil industry apologetics.

569 2018-05-25 22:42:15 It's delusional to think US Regime has any interest in the well being of Iranian people. US overthrew #Mosaddegh in 1953 b/c he nationalized Iran's oil. Now Iran fights US sponsored wahhabi terrorism in Syria for #RegimeChg + must be sanctioned! Only idiots think you're good guys

571 2018-05-25 22:42:10 American govt funded the Taliban despite repressive political views because they promised to fight Soviet threat. America thought they could make sure they kept access to oil pipe, not Russians. Pretty sure that's how it was - happy to be schooled, however!
572 2018-05-25 22:42:05 I saw a similar comment earlier about how the evil SNP hadn't been honest last time about oil being a bonus, not the entire case for indy. Which, again, was exactly the kind of thing they were saying - it's the icing on the cake, not the basis etc. Total revisionism.

577 2018-05-25 22:41:35 If you put an essential oil under your highlight ( that doesn’t take off your foundation ) it’ll make that shit beam!! The one I used was made for me so I couldn’t tell you what oil is in it but that’s my trick!!

609 2018-05-25 22:37:09 Gas prices are up $1.50 since #LiarInChief was elected. Oil companies get tax breaks and still charge us more.
610 2018-05-25 22:36:54 We liberals have every right to blame Trump for the high gas prices. After all, he deregulated & promoted fossil fuel & natural gas & there should be plenty of oil and gas available. If the oil industry is inflating prices then the president should sign an executive order, right?
611 2018-05-25 22:36:51 ‘Scottish oil’ has been the deposit for the UKs mortgage since before Thatcher. As well everyone knows. Oh and by the way, we do have a central bank now, why not then too? We are owed. As I’m sure you know.
612 2018-05-25 22:36:44 The problems in Venezuela are a product of the US deep state cabal that wants their oil, and will not tolerate them not buying into the petrodollar Ponzi scheme. This is another Libya in the making. The people are honest and the despise what the US is doing to their economy.
613 2018-05-25 22:36:40 Not to be shallow about this, but for most issues, for instance, you could replace Toronto with Vancouver on housing affordability, and the rest of Ontario with most of the rest of B.C on the struggling economy.  Replace Ontario resource extraction with B.C resources or Alb oil.

679 2018-05-25 22:28:05 Fracking produces Gas, the vast majority of production is Oil, it’s correct that the cost of extraction is greater in the North Sea but as the price rises the tax figure can be varied as has historically been the case.

692 2018-05-25 22:25:08 The two things have nothing to do with each other.

You figured out how this number can appear as small. You could also say how much % did atmospheric CO2 increase since 1990. (Or even better a hundred years ago when we were just getting into burning all the coal and oil)
693 2018-05-25 22:24:59 @NewshubNationNZ @NewstalkZB @InsightRNZ @TVONENZ @Megan_Woods @jacindaardern STOP Exporting Naki Oil Use @ Marsden Point 4 Our Fuel ASAP !
694 2018-05-25 22:24:47 Working on Proximity switches, divider blocks and oil lube pumps today!!
695 2018-05-25 22:24:45 The way I lather my face in oil after a shower, has me looking like handsome squidward 
696 2018-05-25 22:24:45 @AhwalCare الى الان لم يتواصل معنا احد ؟
697 2018-05-25 22:24:42 And take every non Muslim out of Muslim countries. We'll see how long you'll last before you come begging for oil and resources.
698 2018-05-25 22:24:38 Yep. Oil is one of those commodities that can easily be controlled by supply.. like other bulk commodities such as iron ore.. watch the oilers take a hit Monday.
699 2018-05-25 22:24:14 Won’t bust UNC for giving away free grades, won’t allow a walk-on play, who needs prescribed cannabis oil for his seizures. Yep, no one is surprised by the @NCAA’s Usual decision making.
700 2018-05-25 22:24:00 Elizabeth May is holding onto an umbrella made from bitumen oil ! Just saying many Greens may be all wet.
701 2018-05-25 22:23:35 Maybe Big Orange can cut a deal with his comrades in Moscow for cheaper oil?   I just spent $75 to fill up my tank!  Crikey!
702 2018-05-25 22:23:04 It’s also strange because French oil giant is going to spend 100 million to get folks in methane burning machines. Spend the French folks money, not our money from #VW’s truancy.
703 2018-05-25 22:22:55 "For she said, 'I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.' Therefore, behold, I will hedge up her way with thorns, And I will build a wall against her so that she cannot find her paths." Hosea 2:5b-6

705 2018-05-25 22:22:42 お客様っ！！！店内で油田を掘るのは禁止です！！！

英文：Sir !!! this store forbitted a parson to dig an oil field !!!
706 2018-05-25 22:22:40 Why is this govt doing stuff they never campaigned on or talked about during the election, such as banning oil and gas? They have no mandate fo this, barely a mandate for govt at all. Arrogant wreckers...instead of the calm pair of hands that English and National provided. Sad.
707 2018-05-25 22:22:27 TWICE
708 2018-05-25 22:22:22 Dora dora..Yaaa... and the bad talkers open their brains to the whole world...Boss why don't you do your thing with the oil and the lots of things u have...they would guide u..
709 2018-05-25 22:22:21 TTS ranked is the most unforgiving gaming experience i have ever come in contact with. People immediately pick shields, lion, glaz, ying; all on the first round just to complain about the other team doing it too. Im convinced TTS elo is equally, if not more, valuable to oil/gold
710 2018-05-25 22:22:15 @sanchezcastejon backed down from calling Spain's govt. to account over police violence of #1Oct. He backed art. 155 suspending home rule in #Catalonia. He's been pouring water on troubled oil, gravely insulting president @QuimTorraiPla. No confidence in his no-confidence motion.
711 2018-05-25 22:22:11 light cooking oil is great for removing finger prints from stainless steel 
712 2018-05-25 22:22:04 And you're forgetting the oil and gas fields off the west coast
713 2018-05-25 22:21:38 there’s no value in the least efficient form of oil extraction. tarsands are also the dirtiest. there’s no value in destroying Canada’s environment for something that can be extracted more cheaply cleanly and easily elsewhere
714 2018-05-25 22:21:34 Love it CNN's Frankenstein . . It's a shame his momma and daddy never taught him about respect. Needs turned over a knee and spanked.
715 2018-05-25 22:21:30 Great article Agro 
Considering Oil price has enjoy a lengthy rally over 11 months now. it may have topped out for now Manipulated by OPEC !?.. ..
716 2018-05-25 22:21:25 This happened to me twice last week because I tried some sorta oil that was supposed to help my hair and it DIDNT ALSO DRY SHAMPOO DOESNT WORK FOR ME
717 2018-05-25 22:21:12 It's the tax take Graeme not the price. Huge tax breaks were given away to keep the industry intact, even the gowth commision discounts oil revenues going forward. There are cheaper places to extract oil and the US is now pretty much self sufficient with fracking.
718 2018-05-25 22:21:08 coconut oil season
719 2018-05-25 22:20:55 @TheMindOfColi what’s this about #pickles?
i like bread&butter style, and also the Taiwanese variety (salt, sugar, chili-peppers, sesame oil, n perhaps a squeeze of lemon juice + a hint of soy sauce)  
720 2018-05-25 22:20:48 Most blatant lies. America is the most brutal, vulgar, worst imperialist in the history of mankind. Who bombed many sovereign nations for oil and money. Who support unconditionally the dirtiest evil in the world Israel. Who produces sick men that kill school children every month
721 2018-05-25 22:20:38 There is responding and then there is doing.. just like the oil and gas situation
722 2018-05-25 22:20:26 Yes. Steam is great. We use it to get oil out of the sand in Fort McMurray. I hope viable options come online however to say it again there is no economically viable “green” wide scale option to keep our world turning. Hard to make the plastic products we use every day with steam
723 2018-05-25 22:20:19 I am really tired about rants about a man who replaced a shill for oil goof boy.
724 2018-05-25 22:20:15 I was using too many skin care products. What helped a lot was @HaloBeauty vitamin. It probably balanced the oil and now i have no breakouts and my skin is even. I go to the esthetician for hydrofacials and peels once a month and now I rarely use foundation.
725 2018-05-25 22:20:11 So we use up the gold mine (tarsands oil) in spite of the fact that it will accelerate climate change? Just the #TMX will be equivalent to adding emissions of 2 700 000 cars annually. Morally - you think that is ok?  We spend our 'gold' regardless of human suffering?
726 2018-05-25 22:20:00 The while coconut oil ep is bops
727 2018-05-25 22:19:58 If any of you know about a celebrity or a well-known person that likes to buy traditional oil on canvas beautiful paintings or innovative sculptures for their homes, please tell me about them. Im trying to prove a point that art still matters, please help boost this.
728 2018-05-25 22:19:45 Well, they would've ruled him ineligible for being a walk-on if not for the cannabis oil.
729 2018-05-25 22:19:42 Bukola Saraki remains one of the few leader who move along as the country liberate, he has taken his time to understand that many things will be done wrong in good faith and at the same good faith Nigerians will be up to correct him.

Reason why he always welcome new ideology.
730 2018-05-25 22:19:40 I imagine the NCAA's problem is that legitimate use of the oil could mask a positive urine test for marijuana. far-fetched and unfair.
731 2018-05-25 22:19:29 Bouta get my oil changed
732 2018-05-25 22:19:29 I don't usually get involved here, but if the kids using a non-psychoactive oil to control a serious medical issue, what's the problem?? Pretty upsetting he would lose his eligibility over this.
733 2018-05-25 22:19:26 plis pakai nivea oil control. berminyak sangat dah tu, smpai nampak pantulan Ds
734 2018-05-25 22:19:26 i have it. the shade is too dark for me so i use it on dark skinned clients with troubled skin. its super full coverage but i noticed it gets oily after a couple hours, im a grease monkey tho oil is inevitable so i be having to blot. i give it 8/10.
735 2018-05-25 22:19:20 Put tea tree oil or witch hazel on it (diluted with water). Coming from someone who had painful cystic acne on their body, it works. (I just don't know if it will clear it completely overnight).
736 2018-05-25 22:19:19 Instability in the Middle East (which Trump continues to stoke) ALWAYS leads to higher oil prices and subsequently higher gas prices.

738 2018-05-25 22:19:04 Go back in history Lou and give us a history lesson,,What did they do to the Indian tribe that had all the oil under their land at the end of the 1930s in the 40s they have been corrupt since the beginning with very few good leaders
739 2018-05-25 22:19:01 Why? CBD oil doesn’t have the “high”.. so he is taking medicine, not drugs.
740 2018-05-25 22:18:50 The Oil & Gas Industry is doing more than polluting Rivers and Lakes, the air we breath, destroying the ozone layer that protects us from the Sun. In Oklahoma we have more Earthquakes than Ca! Thanks to waste water from Fracking being injected deepbinto our lands!#StopFrackingNow
741 2018-05-25 22:18:45 Why’d so many go down at once? Oil on track?
742 2018-05-25 22:18:33 Couldn't care less about the CBD oil, but a brain prone to seizures and football's damage to people's brains are not a good mix.
743 2018-05-25 22:18:33 Oil. Killing me!
744 2018-05-25 22:18:33 Because other oil producing countries save for a rainy day. Perhaps,  stealing was not other of the day as they described stealing as corruption.
745 2018-05-25 22:18:22 Yep. I hope Oilers do a 2 for 1 trade, with the Oil getting best player in deal.
746 2018-05-25 22:17:51 Just had my sister and brother help me triple team my Jeep cause the engine oil cap was welded shut now we celebrate our victory with the ac on full blast and food
747 2018-05-25 22:17:39 Use organic African black soap on your beard then moisturize it with Shea butter or Jamaican black castor oil... thank me later
748 2018-05-25 22:17:36 Poor guy. Cognitive dissonance is strong with this one. There is no established ‘petro economy’ in the world that can’t establish a lender of last resort. After all, the UK has done it on the back of OUR oil for 40+ yrs now...
749 2018-05-25 22:17:34 U.S. has experienced both reduced petroleum consumption and a significant boost in liquids production – not to mention market-created jobs. The net result has been a decline in net petroleum imports of 4 million barrels per day. Oil shouldn’t be above $30 a barrel!!
750 2018-05-25 22:17:34 As you are filling your tanks with $3 - $5 per gallon gas, you can thank the Traitor and Chief, who pulled out of the Iran nuclear agreement. This was done in a quid pro quo to Putin & his oligarchs. The crumbling Russian economy needed a boost that higher oil prices provided.
751 2018-05-25 22:17:26 @MissyJo79 @WayneDupreeShow  just young kid, media jump start no need to oil it
752 2018-05-25 22:17:06 baby girl wait until i put 20 face masks on you, give you a deep tissue back massage with hot oil, and then fops does your makeup with stupidly expensive shit from sephora
753 2018-05-25 22:17:03 We are burning the oil of our lamp for ego satisfaction, to win in the society in many from (jealously factor in girl's). Can you think what will be the sensation or feeling after your fulfilment your goals? Because feeling and sensation never stop even after getting ego satisfan
754 2018-05-25 22:16:54 "Lookin' fine, bro! Check it out, we both got scarves! Now that's stylin'!" (Oil Man, MM Powered Up)
755 2018-05-25 22:16:51 Taking this oil pan off gonna be the death of me.
756 2018-05-25 22:16:47 When oil and gas production increases, employment rates increase 
757 2018-05-25 22:16:44 Can you tell your good buddy Putin to increase oil production maybe Saudi Arabia too, you know how to make deals right....Gas prices up 31% from last Memorial Day!!
758 2018-05-25 22:16:41 Frankly, I wish our govt would fix oil at 80 so fracking is profitable and go energy independent, keep our $ and jobs stateside.  To hell with all those ME countries, let them herd goats and eat sand.

They’ve been at war for 2000 years but all of a sudden it’s US fault. Fk that.
759 2018-05-25 22:16:37 They actually increased interest rates you are behind on events. Plus the currency was falling you need to raise interest rates to mitigate the depreciation now transfer that scenario to Nigeria and think for a moment about the effects (hint: oil Price)
760 2018-05-25 22:16:36 Oil patch hits slippery slope! 
761 2018-05-25 22:16:33 I think its total BS they block him and he wouldn't even be playing if he didnt have the oil! The NCAA need to gain some sense.
762 2018-05-25 22:16:32 i would die if coconut oil didnt exist like a bitch uses it on her body, eyebrows, and in her food
763 2018-05-25 22:16:28 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
764 2018-05-25 22:16:28 Watching the #Transformers episode of the Netflix show The Toys That Made Us.. and I had NO IDEA that Takara's version of #GIJoe was shrunk down to size when the oil crisis hit - resulting in Microman. Which in turn, gave us the #Micronauts. WOW.
765 2018-05-25 22:16:26 There was oil

767 2018-05-25 22:16:15 This is a game in which you find the cheapest 3.5+ star hotel and try to figure out what's wrong with it before you get there. More often then not, there isn't anything actually wrong with it. In this case, the Hilton was hosting a Regional Yu-Gi-Oh! tournament in the lobby.
768 2018-05-25 22:16:11 Grad announcements sent 
Car inspected & oil changed 
Prom dress altered & picked up  
I still have so much to get done in the next few weeks 
769 2018-05-25 22:16:03 Trying out a paste of honey and coconut oil to condition my hair. My hair will either be awesome or sticky when I'm done.

K Dogbevi. More to cover WRT Ghana, thru FTOS-Gh Campaign team. Would like to discuss, if you have some time.
773 2018-05-25 22:15:44 Oil and gas is also one of the largest sectors of the Scottish economy. Genuinely shocked it got a mention... 
774 2018-05-25 22:15:25 Canadians using their right to protest, to stop a dirty oil pipeline, lined with taxpayers dollars! Use those dollars on #hospitals #schools #infrastructure #cleanjobs
775 2018-05-25 22:15:15 If you talk against SP constructively, I believe Saraki himself will appreciate the fact that someone who might have seen something wrong in his affairs is talking, absolutely he shall welcome your divergent opinion as against his own if it worth it.
776 2018-05-25 22:15:13 is this still about your beautyworks oil lid being off hahahahaha
777 2018-05-25 22:15:13 Check your Transmission oil this weekend.
778 2018-05-25 22:15:13 How do I reset the “change oil” message in my @Jeep after I get my oil change @jiffylube? I got it changed but the message is still there
779 2018-05-25 22:15:12 @FacesOfAO I pray many get the help that is needed. Iwentto Vietnam twice in medical units at Long Binh. Not a combat place, but I came across Agent Orange in my face twice. Desert Storm oil fires. VA will not honor either. Guess who cares.
780 2018-05-25 22:15:09 Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, the 32-year-old media-savvy leader of the oil kingdom, has been unnaturally quiet recently, so much so that some in the Middle East media couldn’t help but wonder if he is dead.

783 2018-05-25 22:14:49 You're not wrong, but Aberdeen University was given funding to survey for oil there a couple of years ago. Can't work out why if Irish territory.
784 2018-05-25 22:14:36 You don’t think I don’t know how to do it myself? I’m not gonna change my oil if it’s still maple syrup brown

786 2018-05-25 22:14:23 When a charlatan, snake oil salesman like @elonmusk bites the hand that feeds him is truly so “2018!” I love waking up in the morning to see the next DemoRat darling that is crashing and burning !! They eat their own...

788 2018-05-25 22:14:10 I really hope you're right as I fear what the province would look like if they began the undoing all the work Notley has done to diversify the economy in AB by only investing in oil.
789 2018-05-25 22:13:28 My car is supposed to get an oil change every 6,000 miles. I haven’t changed it in a year, which was about 15,000+ miles ago in hopes it would die. 

It didn’t and this car has a stronger will to live than I do.
790 2018-05-25 22:13:26 My snake oil salesman has also updated his.
791 2018-05-25 22:13:22 Getting my oil changed and I remember 2 years ago I was at oil changers off Monterey & an hour after I was home I got a phone call from an employee that helped me n he asked if we wanted to hang out. I said isn’t this unprofessional and he said no I’m callin from the office phone
792 2018-05-25 22:13:18 Nope, I heard u just put the oil in the gas tank and call it good lol
793 2018-05-25 22:13:17 Come in Iona , your time is up. David , take your oil #Repeal8th
794 2018-05-25 22:13:14 Oil is of course a big part of it,but the petro $ as trade currency keeps US in cheap debt. How we finance war. If no oil,still will be petro (trade) $ for other purchases unless China can replace with gold-backed renminbi
795 2018-05-25 22:13:08 I'm calling it....OPEC is a spent force. It no longer controls crude oil prices which move irrespective of its decisions.

In Sweden women have been honor killed. Thrown off balconies, shot or stabbed to death. One man was forced to drink boiling oil. Little girls are heavily controlled. We have to deal
798 2018-05-25 22:12:43 Gas and oil ..forget em
799 2018-05-25 22:12:17 Oil prices at $70 are way better for the domestic oil industry than $30. This helps us get closer to energy independence. Gasoline prices are linked to oil prices and are very low when indexed to inflation and buying power.
800 2018-05-25 22:12:13 After you sold out Alaska to Trump and the oil companies. This makes a lot of sense, not!
801 2018-05-25 22:12:11 #rangers are so fucked that even rubbing cannabis oil on them wouldn't fix them.
802 2018-05-25 22:12:07 Reality check from an Alaskan. Palin's executive experience included being mayor of town of about 6000 which hired a city manager to run it. And a state with about 600,000 people. State was flushed with cash due to high oil prices then so no angst about budget cuts.
803 2018-05-25 22:12:05 Maduro should be brought down quickly. Economic chaos even being a oil producer show what happens under socialism. U.S. should engineer a coup & get rid of this criminal.

833 2018-05-25 22:09:43 Nope, I'm on both sides, solar on my house, he furnace/AC but I view oil as the only viable fuel for hvy truck/eq, lg ships and aircraft so why not get the biggest value while we can rather than sell to US at a 20-40% discount, loosing 15-30 Million/day in tax & royalties

844 2018-05-25 22:08:50 Please Retweet if you're also appalled that the Government banned new offshore oil exploration *without even asking* its public officials if the ban would even reduce carbon emissions!

849 2018-05-25 22:08:32 I would like to THANK all corrupt NJ politicians who have an interest in oil/gas for raising gas prices after a significant gas tax increase. Consequently, many NJ families are spending the Holiday weekend working a 2nd job so they can afford gas to get to their primary job.

852 2018-05-25 22:08:03 The true test of a doughnut shop is their plain cake doughnut. It should not be oily or greasy, and you can taste whether they chang the frying oil often enough. Icing is a copout if the basic doughnut isn’t excellent.
853 2018-05-25 22:07:59 Whoopi doo. Gas is up 31% since last Memorial Day so all that boom you want to take credit for goes poof at the pump. No surprise there as just about everybody in the swamp takes money from the oil companies.
854 2018-05-25 22:07:56 It is pathetic how Alberta, @RachelNotley and pipeline supporters are blaming @jjhorgan for all of Alberta's ills, maybe they should blame 44 years of PC economic mismanagement of oil wealth. They should have taken a page from Norway's book. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #stopKM

869 2018-05-25 22:04:53 I'm unsure if you all realize how blatantly some entrenched interests (oil, gas, and auto) have used their surrogates in the media to disparage Musk, often slanderously, and cast undeserved negative light on Tesla. He has every right to lambast the media.

871 2018-05-25 22:04:40 Yeah I def recommend that as a last resort type of thing bcus birth control has its other bogus side effects. Tea tree oil also works good for acne maybe try mixing a bit with your body wash :) just make sure to only use it on your chest/back cus it can dry your skin out!

892 2018-05-25 22:01:45 Greenpeace only ever cites credible triple-checked scientists. Oil and Gas on the other hand has lied (and been caught lying) repeatedly. In addition, they have been exposed as spending millions to fund fake science and spread disinformation and doubt.

913 2018-05-25 21:59:07 The previous govt signed the Paris Accord now this govt is actually taking steps. Ending oil & gas exploration has been an inevitability for a very long time. Business should have been preparing to transition #nationnz
914 2018-05-25 21:59:02 That would be in an ideal world. However, from what occurred in our first oil boom where quite a few Caribbean nations borrowed and never paid us back was just a taste of what a federated Caribbean would have been like.
915 2018-05-25 21:59:01 Richard Hills. It does affect jobs - I know people who have literally lists jobs this week. They are from consultancies that support the oil and gas explorers. With no new offshore permits on offer, there won’t be the work. So they’re gone.

Cannabis oil capsules aren't available here either.
922 2018-05-25 21:57:44 You are indeed correct, it is governed by the price of a barrel of Oil as always. However! When some Idiot does something to upset the market THEY cause the price to go up and guess who did that. #CadetBoneSpurs this time

925 2018-05-25 21:57:19 Maybe because of the extreme pragmatism of engineering vis a vis science?
Now, onto a more spicy question, where are all the non-coding engineers on twitter (mechanical/oil/chemical/civil). They seem quite underrepresented.

929 2018-05-25 21:56:42 Please do your due diligence and look at the media bias against Musk. Legacy media is just a blow horn for entrenched interests in this country. Musk is a disrupter (of oil and gas)  and they have continually slandered him for years to discredit his efforts and achievements.

932 2018-05-25 21:56:23 Try tramadol as a alternative to oxycodone, its easily available from any chemist store. Both are opiods. my advice: go with natural painkillers such as cannabis oil, valerian root, boswellia or frankincense essential oil.

941 2018-05-25 21:55:50 Reason: Arctic cold spell + not enough nat gas pipeline capacity in New Engl. Gas goes first to home heating. Power imports from Canada decrease during cold weather because they heat with electricity. The NE power generation stations that are dual-fuel switch to oil.
942 2018-05-25 21:55:40 In 1979 the establishment realised that Scotland was on the brink of leaving the union but Oil was now discovered, they simply closed all industries, cars,steel, coal, ships but never touched the oil.   This was to keep us dependent on them.

946 2018-05-25 21:54:50 have you considered cbd oil?? i know it shrinks tumors in dogs and cats (so it must help for humans in some way too) and can help with symptoms of chemotherapy. it also doesn't interfere with chemo so you can do both at the same time. i love you very much nd am thinking of u

966 2018-05-25 21:50:52 All from renewable sources e.g. solar, hydro, geothermal, hydrogen energy, biomass, etc - not coal, oil & gas
967 2018-05-25 21:50:49 Stopped to get an oil change after work and homegirl changing my oil has BUBBLE.....
968 2018-05-25 21:50:32 #gasprices 
Does anybody care that gas prices have skyrocketed thanks to trumps foreign policy?? In part because since he nullified the Iran Nuclear Deal on the word of Netanyahu future traders see the decrease in Iranian oil into the marketplace
Thanks for nothing trump
969 2018-05-25 21:50:32 That shot could use of oil derricks or maybe a private “propeller plane”
970 2018-05-25 21:50:24 sorry to hear that! Have you ever tried CBD oil?
971 2018-05-25 21:50:22 Did you go to any oil wrestling events with Kitchener NDP candidate Fitz "the whip) Vanderpool?
972 2018-05-25 21:50:15 InfoChip's #RFID products are ideal for industries like oil & gas, rigging, lifting, #mining, #aerospace, construction, & rental companies.
973 2018-05-25 21:50:02 One thing I miss about *not* working bikini coffee is having a full on bush. It was so soft and weekly conditioned with coconut oil.
974 2018-05-25 21:49:50 But are credits really just a mask to cover what we are doing? Do you believe we can continue to drill our oceans for oil for the next 100 years?
975 2018-05-25 21:49:43 That moment when your car breaks down after you get an oil check
976 2018-05-25 21:49:32 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
977 2018-05-25 21:49:29 Just like Alberta’s going to cut off the oil. Why do you keep reposting this bullshit

979 2018-05-25 21:49:11 Getting a oil change , hate this car

982 2018-05-25 21:48:26 Yup. Thats what i do. But at night i do 2 washes, a toner, a moisturizer then a facial oil
983 2018-05-25 21:48:24 @BabestationTV hope tonight’s the night that @AshleyEmmax returns to her filthyiest #Oil #ButtNaked #OilFans #OilOverload #XRated #OldSkool #PhoneSex

985 2018-05-25 21:48:14 These mfs taking 4eva wit this oil change
986 2018-05-25 21:48:08 LOL!! Says a guy with "I love Oil & Gas" in his cover and supports the guy who hasn't even released his platform. Election time sure makes for great comedy.
987 2018-05-25 21:47:56 My #EndOfTheWorldTheory..?

The only thing 'virgin' waiting for anyone is just amazing olive oil.
988 2018-05-25 21:47:54 Man dem go feel the energy from two planets away
989 2018-05-25 21:47:42 Wonder how many of million cows will be lost to the Taranaki. Govt was willing to sacrifice you without a thought with oil and gas decision. No consultation, no analysis, just idiocy. Don't think they won't cull cow numbers too.Not about developing regions. All about sacrificing.
990 2018-05-25 21:47:39 Good question @lisaowennz - why is oil and gas the first on the Govt's "hit list", not the likes of dairy and coal. #nationnz
991 2018-05-25 21:47:33 It’s a heavy oil? Like is the consistency closer to coconut or like castor. Tryna see if I can use it on my curls boo
992 2018-05-25 21:47:29 Omg I am worried for you but nothings going to change the fact that by 2035 were going to be really low on oil reserves  fun fact
993 2018-05-25 21:47:22 It sounds like he has been taking lessons from Jesse Jackson.
994 2018-05-25 21:47:21 As oil prices are increasing... yes it was at a low about 5 years ago, currently it’s climbing. If oil is at $35-40/ per barrel is economical.
995 2018-05-25 21:47:16 Keep them guessing with oil of no age....
996 2018-05-25 21:47:04 This is the government that justified Iraq’s war according to fake news produced by the Pentagon in the era of G Bush jr. Tony Blair, J.M. Aznar and G. Bush Jr thew us to a war against Iraq, in favour of Oil US companies. We must remember the past to better understand the present

1000 2018-05-25 21:46:24 "I don't have the money for that" shuts them up pretty quick. When they realize they can't milk any more $$$ out of you, all of a sudden all you need is an oil change.
1001 2018-05-25 21:46:06 oil balancing moisturizer je eh ? kalau moisturizer yg biasa takleh ke but still brand simple (yg trial pack tu? ? hahahaa sorry banyak tanya 
1002 2018-05-25 21:45:57 I’ve been using coconut oil for sooo many other reasons for what I initially bought it for
1003 2018-05-25 21:45:54 Well, the water's cold...
1004 2018-05-25 21:45:48 If u sending jerk vids at least put oil on the dick.. thank you

1006 2018-05-25 21:45:32 He is a tedious snake oil salesman
1007 2018-05-25 21:45:23 oil change, car on f, got the car wash 
1008 2018-05-25 21:45:06 several friends swear that CBD oil is a game-changer, ymmv
1009 2018-05-25 21:45:06 These bsers said gold backed/exchangeable  in sept  2017- its always been ONLY a yuan denominated oil futures contract with NOTHING to do with gold
1010 2018-05-25 21:44:52 shoutout to Mobil 1 oil for making their caps the worst fucking thing to open.
1011 2018-05-25 21:44:41 Once WM repays the stolen oil revenue, we'll be quids in #indyref2
1012 2018-05-25 21:44:24 Govt is getting advice on whether a law change is needed around the ban of new offshore oil and gas exploration. If it is, the public might for the first time have an opportunity to formally share their two cents on the decision. #nationnz
1013 2018-05-25 21:44:22 I will bring groundnut oil n Maggie
1014 2018-05-25 21:44:05 Energy Minister says the oil & gas exploration ban decision was about showing leadership when asked about lack of consultation. #nationnz #nzpol
1015 2018-05-25 21:44:04 olive oil oy that sounds hardcore
1016 2018-05-25 21:43:53 I try to get as much water intake and sleep as possible..plus I find rubbing some peppermint oil on my temples can really help, the cooling effect is quite soothing

1018 2018-05-25 21:42:52 And NCAA rules are for THC drug screening failure. I guarantee he got a legal prescription for just CBD oil in Alabama, and they just dont want a player associated with something derived from cannabis/hemp.
1019 2018-05-25 21:42:47 Super easy. I can give you the ingredients but not measurements. I do per taste. Jalapeños, Anaheim peppers, cilantro, olive oil, cumin, salt, black pepper, fresh garlic. Throw in the food processor. I use a lot of jalapeños relative to Anaheim (2-1) and a lot of cilantro.
1020 2018-05-25 21:42:32 so agree. don't get it.
must be all about $ & oil.
1021 2018-05-25 21:42:21 Engga bikin minyakan kok face oil itu. Apalagi grapeseed fungsinya nahan minyak
1022 2018-05-25 21:42:12 Coconut oil is high in lauric acid and a naturally antiviral, antibacterial & antifungal food. Add 1-2 Tbsp. to your daily Green Smoothie!
1023 2018-05-25 21:42:07 Apparently, it's "jojoba oil," pronounce "ho-hoba" and it's not HOBO oil.

Things make much more sense now.

1025 2018-05-25 21:41:23 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.
1026 2018-05-25 21:41:23 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1027 2018-05-25 21:41:16 @JakeScottZone @GordonMonson @austinhorton I can get CBD oil at my local health food store. It has helped me with some pain relief.  in my opinion if I can get it at the local grocery store it should not be banned

1035 2018-05-25 21:39:46 The Govt couldn't use the formal "cost benefit analysis tool" before deciding to ban new offshore oil and gas exploration because there were too many "unknowns". #nationnz

1041 2018-05-25 21:39:17 In the oil rich countries of the Gulf families are petrified of their daughters marrying out into different tribes, because families don't want to share their secrets. or their businesses, with another tribe.
1042 2018-05-25 21:39:13 Of course im not saying to cut it down im saying to add it up. I grill it with olive oil and basic herbs
1043 2018-05-25 21:39:09 Two Taranaki businesses may be shutting bc of oil & gas exploration ban - but Energy Minister makes the point that business & jobs in the sector have been reducing since 2014. #nationnz #nzpol

1045 2018-05-25 21:39:04 Its troubling that the "line if attack" on Megan Woods is what "cinsultation" she had with the oil industry. Was the Health ministry required to consult the tobacco industry?
1046 2018-05-25 21:39:02 Overcooked the hell out of my rice... Woops.

On the bright side my stir fry came out pretty good. Just need to use less oil next time.

1053 2018-05-25 21:38:22 I bow to your supremacy. Is compromise worth it? Namely, warm crostini + olive oil + ripe tomatoes and a hearty smattering of COLD burrata. Arugula sounds like it needs a prescription cream.
1054 2018-05-25 21:37:37 Trump made over $100,000 last year by selling Trump deodorant, bathrobes and coin banks. Never thought I’d see a snake oil salesman in the White House profiting off the presidency. The GOP lost its mind because Obama wrote a book.

1064 2018-05-25 21:36:57 You’re drinking the Kool Aid. Aren’t you?
Trump cares not about me, you or the common person. When push comes to shove he will choose those named “trump” and no one that is not in his elitist thinking group. He sold snake oil in a previous life, and still does.
1065 2018-05-25 21:36:44 I’ve been at bob brown Chevy for 20 mins and these 3 white people also waiting for their oil change talking about: gun control, the Iraq war, and the divorce rate. I’m sitting being quite. Minding my own damn business.
1066 2018-05-25 21:36:35 The biggest mistake made with Iraq was not taking Saddam out, anyone informed of Oil for Food scandal with a moral conscience might find it hard to argue against.

1069 2018-05-25 21:36:21 Bought oil today. Guy asked if I wanted an oil filter too. I said they didn’t sell the type of oil filter I need. He said it’s cheaper if I get the filter too. I told him okay and that I’d just sell it on the black market. He didn’t laugh. Pretty sure he thought I was serious.

1075 2018-05-25 21:35:12 Glad John has that out there , ive been saying it for a while - peak oil (use) is near. Scotland could capitalise on it , or be cast off anyway when its no longer a benefit for Westminster.

1077 2018-05-25 21:35:00 see, its not hard to imagine. this economy is fake the stock market is pumped up to cash out. the fiat petrodollar is gonna be systematically pounded into hyperinflation. China is doing what Saddam did before we invaded, trade oil using gold or euros, anything but dollars is WAR
1078 2018-05-25 21:34:59 Is that something like cooking oil? Oil for cooking, alcohol for. . .
1079 2018-05-25 21:34:58 How are u looking crude oil for next week after closing down today 4 percent Tks
1080 2018-05-25 21:34:53 Oil change? check. Tires rotated? check. Brakes replaced? check. Air Conditioner in car repaired? check. Guess which was most important? And now, my car and I are both ready for the summer travel adventures. #widow #adventure #adventureawaits
1081 2018-05-25 21:34:42 A knock on effect is they have to sell this oil and will do everything they can to sabotage alternatives.
1082 2018-05-25 21:34:37 Tried the HL Oil in Lotion punya tester last night. Omg, I was so tempted to buy..........
1083 2018-05-25 21:34:33 Fry's "snake oil salesman" comment at the end was worth the price of admission to see their expressions... I wish I could have seen that live. Jordan did well, Fry stole the show though.
1084 2018-05-25 21:34:29 And we’re basically ran by the oil companies
1085 2018-05-25 21:34:16 ...difficult for parents to assess the viability of, they are well aware that those alternatives might well be "snake oil" but they are in a desperate, unsupported situation, and will try just about anything. Chris has shown them some evidence in support of one option...
1086 2018-05-25 21:33:42 forests in the world are for all humans no exceptions ...
just tell me why the hell oil company own them ?
we should be able and have the right to stop them from destroying our/their nature. its illogical to let them doing it.

1091 2018-05-25 21:33:13 Ok. First up on here, the ban on oil drilling in Taranaki.

I guess what I still really don't get is why the government wanted to run a ban on new exploration rather than looking at ETS. #nationnz
1092 2018-05-25 21:33:09 I’m getting older because oil changes, breaks being fixed, house being cleaned excites me more than being outside .

1094 2018-05-25 21:32:54 Looks like a wind turbine without the blades. A Scottish based launch site should be made on offshore platforms, maybe old oil platform. Using renewable energy to extract Hydrogen fuel from the sea water. Self contained energy production for the rockets.

1100 2018-05-25 21:31:55 Finding that strength to stand tall is so hard to do. Like climbing up a slide with someone pouring oil on it. You get so far you slip try again you slip. Get a bit further working harder and slip again.
1101 2018-05-25 21:31:48 Almost shit bricks when I saw the notorious chocolate milkshake drops (coolant mixing with your oil internally) under my car but we good. It's just water from the a/c dripping on the oil stain from my minor leak.

1105 2018-05-25 21:31:19 A great chance for 45 to earn money on all the gas consumed by vacationers. He has a stake in Rosneft, the Russian oil company, as well as US pipelines.
1106 2018-05-25 21:31:11 Is that enough? :/
How about grilled chicken? The way I make it, I use no oil and only a bit of low fat butter. Loads of herbs.
1107 2018-05-25 21:30:58 You know the pipeline not being put through doesn’t only hurt Alberta oil field workers right, that pipeline is supposed to go through the entire country, it will hurt all of us especially those in the east who want their families home, not out west Missing time with their kids
1108 2018-05-25 21:30:51 Or the massive oil boom that dominated the period we analysed? The government ran deficits through boom times, and bust.
1109 2018-05-25 21:30:48 Buy back oil stocks?
1110 2018-05-25 21:30:45 There is also nothing wrong with LeBron wringing every last win out of this franchise that he can then dropping a match on the oil tags as he leaves.
1111 2018-05-25 21:30:36 I just bought this baby oil & I spilled it 
1112 2018-05-25 21:30:36 Long drag on "supply & demand". Oil price in U.S. Dollars is set in Cushing, Ok. every morning. The oil (tanked reserve) you R using right now is "old" supply. Still, my gas is cheaper than yours because of refinery size, location & transport; little change in my well royalties.
1113 2018-05-25 21:30:19 Because #fossilfuels are still the dominating #energy source, I am becoming an oil market analyst. Not what I want to be but here I am... #renewableenergy #climatechange
1114 2018-05-25 21:30:16 おはよう。二度寝したら追いオリーブだぞ。
1115 2018-05-25 21:29:57 THAT's why fish oil is so popular!
1116 2018-05-25 21:29:42 oh okay I have another friend with looser curls. She mostly uses my conditioners and the golden treatment but very little of the oil goes a long way
1117 2018-05-25 21:29:32 Tweet of the day. Thanks.
1118 2018-05-25 21:29:15 @elonmusk Is it too much to want oil prices to do just fine as consumption drops, and to support growth in  Solar & e.Vehicles?
1119 2018-05-25 21:29:15 We must accelerate the transition from oil to more sustainable energy, so oil extraction becomes less relevant and saves people like the Waorani.
1120 2018-05-25 21:29:12 really?  even the news story in the link basically plays it down because more oil will be released into the market...  I was paying over $4/gal in 2008! But how about those NEW FRIES?
1121 2018-05-25 21:29:12 Had a really good day testing at Mid Ohio yesterday.  Today I headed over to Indy and I got to watch the Indy lights race.  Tonight I’m going to Lucas Oil to watch the mrti races.
1122 2018-05-25 21:29:06 Hahahaha carrot oil!! What the hell is that
1123 2018-05-25 21:29:02 Interesting.  I got into the oil boom in Midland, Texas in 2010.  I started out as a temp as a lab assistant at BJ Chemicals.  It was later bought out by Baker Hughes.  I went from making $18 an hour to making over 56k a month.  It was the ride of a lifetime...
1124 2018-05-25 21:28:24 In this country we have had flim-flam men, snake oil salesmen, ponzi schemes, ... we are amused for a bit and then run them out on a rail.
1125 2018-05-25 21:28:16 and this is coming from someone who treats her nerve disorder with nothing but CBD oil. it works for some and doesn't for others. everyone is different. but i'd like to see one single holistic treatment that could replace my insulin. there are some things that require medicine

1127 2018-05-25 21:27:56 Oil&Gas and Banking are Scotland's aces. Big employers & wages. Wait for the Ineos developments as Wilson's firm advises them. Fracking will come under reindustrialising Scotland banner.
1128 2018-05-25 21:27:47 Troll, understand that there is a difference between the office and who occupies it. If the man in office is a criminal, the law and justice demand his arrest and punishment.
Dolt 45 is an intruder whose election was fixed. A fraudster. He should go now, before we end up at war.

1130 2018-05-25 21:27:42 Doesnt Matter. Atleast the rock has baby oil on his arms!!
1131 2018-05-25 21:27:39 First day of break: went for a run, got an oil change, and rearranged my entire bedroom by myself. Starting off strong! 
1132 2018-05-25 21:27:38 I...was gifted cannibus cooking oil and my square ass haven't the slightest clue what to do with it.
1133 2018-05-25 21:27:37 One could argue that the national oil company is  mismanaged due to the sham elections and corrupt government which the people are unable to change with their impotent votes.
1134 2018-05-25 21:27:35 Call me paranoid but the narrowing backwardation right before the sell off in oil suggests to me that market participants had insider information regarding the OPEC decision. This is why the retail investor should avoid short term speculation.
1135 2018-05-25 21:27:29 Stv news says #GrowthCommission no changes from previous debate.Apart from. Oil, EU, £/€/? GERS, Defecit. Just main basis of w/paper then.
1136 2018-05-25 21:27:14 I was trying to figure out why my hair was NOT cooperating yesterday when I realized that it was gross and humid all day and I put coconut oil in my hair

1139 2018-05-25 21:26:56 For making soap, oil is required. But to clean oil, soap is required. This is the irony of life.
1140 2018-05-25 21:26:46 I gotta get my oil changed tomorrow. Can’t keep pushing it off.
1141 2018-05-25 21:26:46 Oil cleansing hada labo sale. Ok esok i beli. Hahhaha!
1142 2018-05-25 21:26:36 My whole house smells like Murphy oil 
1143 2018-05-25 21:26:28 I’ve had a sewage-plant’s worth of Neck Oil and even I didn’t find I pulled a face. ME.
1144 2018-05-25 21:26:26 that swimsuit picture got me a date today, I'm guessing he wanted to oil me up haha...
1145 2018-05-25 21:26:26 It’s time for all #MAGA supporters to vote with their wallets as well as in the voting booth. Right now the squeaky wheel is getting the oil. Patriots have been shouted down. Some liberals are growing tired or actually seeing the truth but we need to keep the pressure on.
1146 2018-05-25 21:26:11 let me advise you as a lifelong pasta afficionado, that sugar, sir, has NO PLACE in any form of pastamaking. all you need is good tomatoes, shrooms, garlic and onion, olive oil, cheeses and salt and pepper.
1147 2018-05-25 21:26:08 Hey bby. How about you grab that motor oil gurl. @RaineSN7
1148 2018-05-25 21:26:00 Oh he stays on us about it. We just don’t listen. This also applies to oil changes

1153 2018-05-25 21:24:30 Pre-shampoo, shampoo, conditioner, gel, almond oil, and curl product was at least $100 and then I ordered this other stuff that’s supposed to help your hair grow and I just got it today. Life is expensive. Products used to be so much more cheaper when I didn’t have to pay for it
1154 2018-05-25 21:24:30 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
1155 2018-05-25 21:24:29 Jojoba oil and mimosa hair honey with a leave in conditioner
1156 2018-05-25 21:24:24 How many pipeline oil spills have there been in the last 10yrs? 20yrs? 30yrs?
1157 2018-05-25 21:24:22 Honestly, I have no idea why you would believe oil to be on its way out. As developing countries grow their demand for oil grows. There is no viable alternative at this point and even less infrastructure to convert those developing countries.
1158 2018-05-25 21:24:18 This is an extension of Obama's BLM idiots who believe they're entitled to block traffic or protest INSIDE stores. They are NOT and they all should have been arrested after today's stunt. Besides blocking shoppers from navigating the store, they were creating a fire hazard.
1159 2018-05-25 21:24:16 this is the first time i’ve ever let my mileage run over when it’s supposed to have an oil change and it literally makes me sick to my stomach 
1160 2018-05-25 21:23:50 Yup

@MelissaLeeCNBC sorta caught it by asking if Carter's analysis applied to other Energy ETFs
1. $XLE comprised of 'upto' 25% $XOM 20% $CVX now ~40%
2. Charting off a stock trading in narrow 20% range during which time oil was down 80% and up 250%!!
3. $XOP worse

1169 2018-05-25 21:21:43 He is stupid . If he was smart he would.invest and sell CBD oil from his company but instead he tell lies.
1170 2018-05-25 21:21:41 The eco left has been claiming that the world is finished with oil since the 1970s. 

We will be consuming 100 million barrels per day within a year & new supplies are still being found. 

Lets plan based on reality rather than delusional ideological anti oil hysteria #cdnpoli

1175 2018-05-25 21:21:09 Jobless claims are NOT rising. Interest rate increases are actually the sign of a healthy economy. Oil prices are not controlled by a president and $70 oil is healthy for the domestic industry. That and the results of the Trump economy are way better.

1181 2018-05-25 21:20:34 Highest wages and wealth: 
-oil was +$100/barrel which led to lot of that wage growth; unsustainable in a slow/low growth env.
-we had that prior to NDP and still have that now (useless point to make)
- We now have the highest pvt sector job creation in the country
be smarter
1182 2018-05-25 21:20:29 I rubbed oil all over it yesterday. This truly is a great love affair.

1185 2018-05-25 21:19:58 Hey come on rising crude oil prices are good for the US fracking industry! Don't you have shares of oil companies? 

Sorry for everyone, who gets hit by higher gas prices or suffers from environmental polution by fracking, but non of them is of concern for Trump and his friends.

1191 2018-05-25 21:18:47 Wait. So Buhari actually came on air to calculate Nigeria's Crude oil revenue for PDP's 16yrs based on $100 per barrel at 2.2m barrels per day? And none of his Aides could walk up close to him and whisper, "Oga, your head is not correct"

1209 2018-05-25 21:16:41 I drain a can of chickpeas, mix them with some spices (chili powder, garam masala, etc.), olive oil, and agave syrup and roast them in a toaster oven for a few minutes. I added green onions, boiled eggs, parsley, roasted cashew nuts, queso fresco, cucumbers, and roasted peppers.
1210 2018-05-25 21:16:30 Shrink acne by placing a wrapped ice cube on it and leave it on the pimple for 3 minutes. Then cover it with a dab of lavender oil.
1211 2018-05-25 21:16:27 Such a coincidence that Trump is aligned with oil producers Putin & Salman, has dropped CAFE standards, killed Detroit's EVs, wants to tariff foreign imports, and skyrocketing gas prices already inexplicably up $1.50/gallon since he started, despite global oil glut.
1212 2018-05-25 21:16:27 What are the requirements to be elected an essential oil?
1213 2018-05-25 21:16:18 Shale drilling is not profitable when oil prices are low. OPEC kept oil flowing putting these guys out of business.
1214 2018-05-25 21:16:16 For your info oil licenses have already be renewed for another 10 years so stop spreading false info
1215 2018-05-25 21:16:08 You don't keep up do you? Obama spent 52 million dollars on breaking speculation on wall street that drove oil prices up. He also spoke with the Saudi King ( now deceased) and he pledged that oil prices would never reach 100 dollars again. Jared went and changed that last year.

1218 2018-05-25 21:15:34 Buhari has elevated lying to an art.Following the strategy of authoritarians,he is degrading truth—as a political strategy.APC leaders r enabling him by doing nothing.The truth must matter.Average oil price/output was not $100/2.1mbpd.
1219 2018-05-25 21:15:25 Some people do their best to care, but we continue to extract oil & turn it into plastic products that do lasting, increasingly irreversible damage the ecosystem. Ultimately, our descendants will chart the degradation by looking at the logos. Unless we can kick our addiction
1220 2018-05-25 21:15:19 Somehow I didn't take enough snake oil. It isn't working on me.

1242 2018-05-25 21:12:26 No surprise you don't understand about an oil fund. You did once ask where the money in an oil fund would come from. #GrowthCommission states that oil revenue would not be used as general income but would go into a separate oil fund. Like Norway.
1243 2018-05-25 21:12:14 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
1244 2018-05-25 21:12:04 Idk who gave them the green light to butcher a classic. So disappointed. He does look like he he might smell like Olive Oil hairspray theaux lol.
1245 2018-05-25 21:12:02 I can't remember an honest President since Carter. What was it during GW Bush & the Axis of evil? #Iraq & #Afghanistan the sectarian murders & #Fallujah. What when the  CPA Govt was imposed & civic infrastructure privatised incl oil fields?

1248 2018-05-25 21:11:42 TMX was proposed 11 years ago when the world and oil industry were in a VERY VERY different place. Financially, even Kinder Morgan knows, it is no longer viable, that is why they have manipulated the Govt into taking responsibility for the risk.

1254 2018-05-25 21:11:22 No stream tonight. Getting my oil changed. Then got some other stuff to get done before tomorrow. Next stream will be the debut of Sir Remington!
1255 2018-05-25 21:11:21 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
1256 2018-05-25 21:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza this Spring Sampler will be: spicy crust with sweet motor oil and pineapple.
1257 2018-05-25 21:11:06 Could possibly be running it on cooking oil instead of pure diesel. If it is petrol then yes there are regulations in place regarding the amount that can be stored above ground. Also quantities above 5lts should be in a metal container
1258 2018-05-25 21:10:46 It costs more to drill for oil in US/CAN than the Mid E. When the prices dropped, many oil workers suffered at all levels...rig workers, engineers, offices  & suppliers. Entire projects were cancelled. It hurt a lot of ppl but no one seemed to talk about it.
1259 2018-05-25 21:10:30 Oil weighed me down today.
1260 2018-05-25 21:10:22 Buhari has elevated lying to an art.Following the strategy of authoritarians,he is degrading truth—as a political strategy.APC leaders r enabling him by doing nothing.The truth must matter.Avrg oil price/output was not $100/2.1mbpd.

1272 2018-05-25 21:09:30 Climate Denial is one of a dozen RW hoaxes that get pushed as a package.

This fits to Kahneman & Tversky work on decisions and the Sunk Cost Fallacy. The target goes for one hoax, that opens doors for the whole lot.

GOP = Russian bots = NRA = American coal and oil magnates.
1273 2018-05-25 21:09:20 I compared Ken's and wishbone and they both have citric acid. Maybe it is just the amount of vinegar/citric acid they use. 

Or maybe it is that wishbone starts with Maltodextrin while Ken's starts with soybean oil and water 
1274 2018-05-25 21:09:10 Impossible to know. One can make up any theory & defend it.  For example, maybe world wars would never have happened since they required oil & coal.

Or maybe we'd be poor & in bad health due to the slower advance of science, medicine, agriculture, industry, etc.

1277 2018-05-25 21:08:47 Things could have been very different.
In 1850s, #oil production begins. Mainly for lighting.
In 1877, Willoughby Smith's paper describes the effect of light on Selenium. A primitive idea for #solar cells.
In 1878, Edison takes over previous work on the incandescent light bulb.
1278 2018-05-25 21:08:33 A disingenuous liberal is one that opposes drilling, pipelines, and railroad oil transit, but wants to blame GOP for rising gas prices.

1282 2018-05-25 21:08:16 If your problem is the  oil into the river, then you should be behind energy extraction (removing it from the soil) . It's been leaking into the Athabasca River for millions of years. Mining the islands is actually cleaning the problem up.
1283 2018-05-25 21:08:11 Argan oil or olive oil better for your natural hair?

1292 2018-05-25 21:07:51 Now in control of the stream, we have Peak Oil in the studio with special guest @TreJinkins until 4pm PST.
1293 2018-05-25 21:07:49 Ah! You sent him there to deregulate banks, give corporations huge permanent tax cuts, allow toxic chemicals to be dumped into rivers again, sell off public lands to oil companies, explode insurance costs and hand our elections over to the Russians. Really smart Debbie.
1294 2018-05-25 21:07:42 NOPE! Try again. Preservationists decry Private Industry like big oil, whose pipelines ALWAYS spill. Also, not the “ wise use” of natural resources but the “wise collection” of those resources which is nonexistant at this point. Get it right. #BeBest
1295 2018-05-25 21:07:39 I need to get my oil changed so bad 
1296 2018-05-25 21:07:32 So obvious they are gonna blame the russians... Put some more oil on fire wherever you can.. Awful
1297 2018-05-25 21:07:30 You people rely on oil products in  your daily life and can’t see that fossil fuels are the near future? Say you don’t care about the energy sector all you like but there are no large scale viable alternatives. O&G drives our economy, block tmx and we fall further back.

1301 2018-05-25 21:07:11 One time when I was a kid I knew how to make cinnamon candy, and when you pour the cinnamon oil into the corn syrup, it makes this really beautiful silvery steam.
I may or may not have told my friend when I gave him the recipe "make sure you get a whiff of that steam"
1302 2018-05-25 21:06:53 I haven’t use sunblock in ages  i have started using rosehip oil, heard its really good.
1303 2018-05-25 21:06:33 $100 for an oil change . I hate adulting. Take me back to when my only worries consisted of :
-borrowing the car
-Staying up late
-Watching what I want to watch on tv 
-hanging with friends 
I can go on .....
1304 2018-05-25 21:06:29 #Dollar Dominance as a World Reserve Currency is ending. Thanks to USA for imposing Sanctions on Oil Producing Countries like #Iran and #Venezuela. They are willing to accept Indian #Rupee for Trade. In return they wi use the same to buy From Indian Manufacturers.
1305 2018-05-25 21:06:24 To all intents and purposes oil's value to the Scottish taxpayer ended with the oil price crash, it's not about the reserves it's about the profitably recoverable reserves. I know it's an unpopular view but I'd start focusing our engineering talent on fracking.
1306 2018-05-25 21:06:10 Love when a pan of hot oil spits all in my face! Eyes are burning so bad 
1307 2018-05-25 21:05:56 Why it took 3 hours for a fuckin oil change I will never kno

1309 2018-05-25 21:05:49 It did a fantastic job last yr. Just had a little trouble breathing today because I went a little overboard with the oil (not a fan of black widows or brown recluse). It honestly works!

1313 2018-05-25 21:05:19 Russia benefits from higher oil prices. Did Trump screw Americans  by breaking the Iran agreement which resulted in oil prices going up to repay Putin?  ( Just another Trump action for the FBI to look into.)

1319 2018-05-25 21:05:03 I finally unlocked the secret to soft skin: 

1) use Mexican wash cloths/Salux clothes daily
2) sugar scrub 3x a week 
3) apply body butter on wet skin
4) let yourself air dry, avoid using a towel as much as possible 
5) optional: seal moisture with body oil

1327 2018-05-25 21:03:56 Sure. Oil still needed for a long time. But not 90+M bbl/day... once transportation goes electic, #bigoil is done.
1328 2018-05-25 21:03:44 If anyone wants to take over doing adult things for me that’d be cool. Been sitting in lithia for 45 minutes waiting for my oil change and then I have to go to one of my two jobs. Taking applications now for someone to do this for me.
1329 2018-05-25 21:03:38 With oil down big lately, any strategy to make money on rebound
1330 2018-05-25 21:03:36 Olive oil stimulates the hair follicles as well as aloe vera. Coconut oil is good. Jojoba is great for growth too but most importantly it’s also what goes IN your body. Good greens and reds.. fruits and veggies. It’s not all topical 
1331 2018-05-25 21:03:34 Oil
1332 2018-05-25 21:03:26 Double edged sword with this is, if we eventually scale fracking to larger levels we can become more independent for oil and decrease prices. But with increased drilling in the US there are greater risks for oil spills and EARTHQUAKES in the Midwest
1333 2018-05-25 21:03:26 Jamaican black castor oil and coconut oil. 
Use a silk scarf as a doek and don't wrap it too tightly. 
Avoid wearing wigs too often as that contributes to hairline issues. Moisturise your hairline DAILY!
1334 2018-05-25 21:03:26 So you live a day extra by not eating bacon. They did a story on a guy who barely ate anything. His diet was cottonseed oil, sugar, & water.
He didn't do anything except live to next time he took a tablespoon of oil. No job, no real life.
I see no difference in that & junk scienc
1335 2018-05-25 21:03:25 Run away to your London masters, i'm sure they have a cafe for the spineless who want to be ruled by another country. I think you should leave your oil comments alone. You've already proven how intellectually bereft you are on that topic.
1336 2018-05-25 21:03:07 When we look at the Prophet (peace be upon him) in the physical level of fasting, we have to fast like he fasted! When he went into the pre-dawn meal, he was just eating some olives, olive oil, something light!
1337 2018-05-25 21:03:07 Funny, I'm a fairskinned redhead. I've used coconut oil as sunscreen for 5 yrs, including in Arizona hiking, nary a sunburn.
1338 2018-05-25 21:03:02 Obama didn’t apply it in 2010 so trump probably will
1339 2018-05-25 21:02:56 I suppose we're not aloud to talk about your oil money either are we??? We're not Liverpool. We are the biggest club in the world and we did it the old fashion way.....WE EARNED IT!!!!
1340 2018-05-25 21:02:46 Is it any worse than mass unemployment, homelessness, kids going hungry, NHS on its arse, illegal foreign wars, no oil fund, rape clause, bedroom tax, Windrush, offshore tax evasion, knife crime, privatisation, etc, etc.
1341 2018-05-25 21:02:38 Hillary was and is out of touch with reality.
Midland is booming because of oil.
NY is booming with refugees
CA is booming with Invaders
1342 2018-05-25 21:02:25 (I have no idea where u live...)

My point is - we were talking abt pipelines, yes? - that oil is soon to be dead. Gas to follow. Dependent economies need to transition now. Building a pipeline that will become a stranded asset is foolish and wasteful. Agree?
1343 2018-05-25 21:02:14 I'll kick this off with a visit to white shine jewellers Colchester on my way home tonight #whosbeenwhere??

1350 2018-05-25 21:01:22 The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones eased on Friday after a steep drop in oil prices pressured energy stocks, but losses were limited by gains in chipmakers and retail stocks.  Dollar up as commodity-linked currencies slip on oil price slump.

1375 2018-05-25 20:57:09 You have the correct qualifications to be a Trump supporter.

Stupidity.

1376 2018-05-25 20:56:57 @DBChirpy well Trump sold off USA reserves to aid Putin’s need to sell oil.
1377 2018-05-25 20:56:56 I'll remind you to be in support of this I'll talk against the SP too one day,till then,may God extend our lives
1378 2018-05-25 20:56:53 I wonder if there is a relationship be the price of oil the scrapping of The Iran deal and Russia’s reaping a fortune since the price of oil has doubled from last year. Convoluted but obvious.
1379 2018-05-25 20:56:41 Might as well save up for an electric car. I don't trust oil companies
1380 2018-05-25 20:56:40 So this oil shit... I need to lay down
1381 2018-05-25 20:56:27 Our lotion works because of the essential oil extracts, and moisturising oils especially Aloe Vera for soothing bites already gotten before application. And it is natural so no allergies to worry about, which does affect many. Family safe is important too.
1382 2018-05-25 20:56:22 @Harryslaststand fought the Nazis to save things like free speech, your so-called @POTUS won’t let people kneel in protest. Just think that through & the decide who is in the wrong (NOT HARRY)
1383 2018-05-25 20:56:15 The Goverment of Iran is the result of seed you’ve planted 40 years ago just for the share of Oil and other sources. US, UK, and Russia are the partners of dictatorial govenment of Iran and for sure are responsible for all tortures and misseries forced against the people of Iran.
1384 2018-05-25 20:56:08 Werent they peak oil people?
1385 2018-05-25 20:56:05 Olive started yelping when jumping onto and off of furniture about a year ago. It's awful. CBD oil has helped her pain tremendously but made her more ornery, which I didn't know was possible.
1386 2018-05-25 20:56:02 how often do you wash your hair? you should only be washing it every three days or longer. that will reduce the oily since washing it every day strips the oil that it needs so it has to produce more
1387 2018-05-25 20:55:54 Sometimes I wish the oil wells would dry up
1388 2018-05-25 20:55:50 so much oil....
1389 2018-05-25 20:55:47 Bill McBride at Calculated Risk blog occasionally posts interesting updates comparing oil rigs counts to the WTI spot price.
1390 2018-05-25 20:55:44 Jerry Moonbeam Brown loves cheap oil prices. It lets him add more gasoline tax.
Then when things normalize, the tax doesn't go away.
1391 2018-05-25 20:55:43 There's no oil in Afghan.... and why would someone steal opium?
1392 2018-05-25 20:55:43 I need a haircut, 5 coffees, and an oil change.
1393 2018-05-25 20:55:39 The ideas (when put in practice) caused people to starve yes.  

Just like anyone who writes a book about motor oil causing tomatoes to double in size. I would say they hold an ancillary responsibility for the ensuing tomato shortages if those ideas were put in practice.
1394 2018-05-25 20:55:33 My hair is soooooo dry and I’ve found oils don’t work as well for me they just kind of sit there so I use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. I use the joico moisture renewal (incredible) which is kind of pricey so a cheaper one is by ogx and it’s like argan oil and Morocco.
1395 2018-05-25 20:55:00 Wonderful!!!! @Justagricblog  had used neem oil with indigenous black soap on cabbage and tomato. The results was awesome! 

@IITA_CGIAR should kindly take up this project.
1396 2018-05-25 20:54:57 It’s so hot in my house that all my coconut oil melted
1397 2018-05-25 20:54:42 I'm obsessed with lavender oil, attar, cocoa butter, anything that smells good
1398 2018-05-25 20:54:34 "#Oil and #NaturalGas markets are fickle and impossible to predict. Current uncertainties and variables are enormous" You can rely on us to point you in the right direction.
1399 2018-05-25 20:54:29 Can't sleep? Use lavender essential oil in your bath. You will sleep like a baby.
1400 2018-05-25 20:54:22 I was just thinking of making my own insect repellent since I have my nifty geranium oil now!
1401 2018-05-25 20:54:19 I wonder if your immediate steps for rising oil prices has done nothing, what would your immediate steps would be, had it been a rising rapes

1410 2018-05-25 20:53:15 I always feel like my oil heater is gonna  explode 
1411 2018-05-25 20:53:06 @DBChirpy easy. Putin needs to sell oil (Russia’s only real resource) Trump paid in Russian oil in exchange for pro Russian-stances  Trump sold off USA oil reserves making USA beholden to buying more oil. Only way Trump makes $$ and keeps Putin happy. Putin owns Trump

On the last episode of JS, you were giving a recipe - goat cheese, avacado, oil, onions, what else? Can you give any simple meal suggestions? I'm tired of eggs and cheese, salad & steak! Thanks!
1419 2018-05-25 20:52:13 Oil prices are up 41% over the average price during Obama’s last year in office. I hope all you Deplorable’s have a great time at the gas pumps this holiday weekend!

1420 2018-05-25 20:52:08 Our governor and attorney general needed to be TAUGHT by the public the difference between hemp and marijuana and that hemp CBD oil was not psychotropic! They love their guns, beer, discrimination and living in the past here.
1421 2018-05-25 20:51:50 I think I’m also going to do some broccoli, roasted potatoes, and probably cook the salmon in the stove with a little olive oil, rosemary, pepper, and lots of lemon! 

You’re my inspo!
1422 2018-05-25 20:51:33 Brings car in to get oil changed, leaves owing $1200 
1423 2018-05-25 20:51:18 Driving short distances is the worst for your engine. Your engine oil is in sump at turn on & less viscose until it gets properly distributed. Plus components designed to work optimally at full temperature so they don’t fit properly until then.
1424 2018-05-25 20:51:16 When you go to get an oil change and the dumbasses in front of you stand there washing their windows even after they’re done with everything  like move the fuck on somewhere
1425 2018-05-25 20:51:10 Unless that is somehow a satirical tweet and I totally miss the point, that is a rather idiotic thing to write, @Oil_Ranger.

1428 2018-05-25 20:50:35 The price at the pumps should not be determined by the NYSE price of oil per barrel.  Indirectly, it is due to the economy doing so good.

If these guys can't break even then the entire country loses.
Around $80 is a break even point.

1435 2018-05-25 20:49:51 VERY WELL SAID!! This example of more #hypocritical decision making needs to be screamed from the mountaintops. Sue ya for sending us oil, vs not sending us oil.

1443 2018-05-25 20:49:05 Idk about a bob cream. But why don't you do that baking soda mask I sent you. I did another one the other day. And it removes all the oil. It's soooo good

Oh & you guys should support our plan to take advantage of America's natural resources. I know y'all don't know Supply & Demand, but if you increase the oil supply, oil prices fall
1450 2018-05-25 20:48:54 Means; we are not getting outa here until every single drop of oil is sucked out and usurped

1505 2018-05-25 20:43:07 Still lower than the 4-5 dollars a gallon we paid during the Obama years b4 the gas prices went down due 2 a glut of oil on the market.

1521 2018-05-25 20:41:52 Actually, gas prices dipped below what they had been under Bush. And the energy industries — wind, solar, natural gas AND oil —boomed in the Obama years. You’ve been lied to, now you’re relaying the lies.

1619 2018-05-25 20:27:37 Since we now export oil, there should be some sort of regulation to keep our oil here at a lower cost per barrel. It's no longer getting shipped in. We all know oil companies like to gouge us at key travel times.

1657 2018-05-25 20:23:35 it's very very light/sheer but it's good if you just need something to even out your skin tone rather than to cover stuff up! it's kinda dewey (i have the oil free one which is significantly less dewey but the regular one will prob be what you're looking for!)

But the truth is that the president hasn't been showing responsible leadership on many important issues in this country. The facts are there to analyse.

OAPEC issues an embargo, and the 70s oil crisis cripples the US & allies economies.  Things are not so different now.

1745 2018-05-25 20:13:33 Thing you are missing about Saudi Arabia is oil screws their domestic economy so the opportunity cost is probably a lot lower than say USA. Also if women worked it might take jobs from men (given unique economy). I’m not advocating. Just saying SA is economically unique.
1746 2018-05-25 20:13:10 Agreed. They are “blaming” Middle East,  non production in Venezuela , summer months. Plain and simple, squeeze ppl of $$ for vacations travel. We have enough oil. Greed greed greed

1767 2018-05-25 20:11:28 Also bulletproof coffee (and obviously MCT oil, or fats in general) does not spike your insulin levels (and blood sugar), so that's a lot better for you than carbs, assuming you're burning fat (you'd better be keto/fat adapted) for energy rather than carbs.
1768 2018-05-25 20:11:25 Someone pls buy me an oil diffuser I need 30
1769 2018-05-25 20:11:25 This is the airport of a European capital city but the airline names make it sound like an oil rig in The North Sea. #lfc
1770 2018-05-25 20:11:06 When does OPEC not manipulate oil prices?
Don't forget Hillary's emails.
And now with lower taxes on corporate profits is it just a coincidence?

1773 2018-05-25 20:10:44 Well, wasn't a good day today for my stocks, holding $BPT, $XPL and $MLNT. $-53 for the week. Still holding a $30 buy call for July on $BPT and holding a $7.50 buy call on $MLNT for June. These charts still look good overall. OPEC screwing with oil futures lol
1774 2018-05-25 20:10:32 Have you ever had homemade olive oil mayo? Omg.. unbelievable.
1775 2018-05-25 20:10:29 I can’t imagine what non-rust people will think when they see that: “is it some symbolism that oil is precious?”
1776 2018-05-25 20:10:26 Your sure can taste the difference, particularly when your choice of oil is developed in a way to faithfully maintain the essence of the cannabis flower

1779 2018-05-25 20:10:12 The oil and gas data is being treated as a windfall. Ask Iain Gray what happened to the UKs oil fund - why did his party not do a Norway. Why did his party give England our oil fields?
1780 2018-05-25 20:10:11 my hair smells like coconut oil and love right now i love being black like i’m really out here being black i just...i’m overwhelmed by my beauty
1781 2018-05-25 20:10:09 Not much talk there about countries that have legalised cannabis oil for medical use and the good results that have been seen, particularly for severe epilepsy. Not the most balanced or thorough article I've ever seen

1790 2018-05-25 20:09:04 I'm further into the 4 categories, but if it's anything like me, you may need to thicken your hair up a bit. Black castor oil did the trick.
1791 2018-05-25 20:09:01 To be completely honest with u if Gaga comes back to NY with the whole promo I need to create a painting as like last thing to get her notice me so I can stop . But I’m doing so I want to still practice on my oil painting skill still
1792 2018-05-25 20:08:33 Try hot oil treatments before washing. The oil helps make it easier to detangle. Also.... there's a Dominican recipe for heir growth: boil ginger, cinnamon and rosemary and mix the infusion with your favorite oil.
1793 2018-05-25 20:08:32 Bulletproof coffee is coffee with MCT oil and (grass fed if possible) butter or coconut oil.
1794 2018-05-25 20:08:23 Shouldn't @joshfoxfilm be out spending the royalties for all the times RT shows his propaganda?

Speaking of collusion.
1795 2018-05-25 20:08:21 @Count_Scapula Hi Stephanie! Trying to find the name of the essential oil that people use to mask the smell of decomp. Any ideas?

my car: oil....... change.... please.... 
me: money :) for :) food :)
1800 2018-05-25 20:07:12 Apparently US oil companies think we forgot about that whole fracking thing. Yeah we export crude now so they can stop the OPEC cut production bullshit. Greedy bastards just wont quit gouging when they can.
1801 2018-05-25 20:06:59 Make it cupcakes and let's see how fat you get! 

You eat a cupcake for how many goals the other team scored in the loss. Oil lose 7-1; you're eating 7 big size cupcakes. Sure you'll get diabetes and go into debt but cupcakes are fun!
1802 2018-05-25 20:06:58 Stocks end mostly, but modestly, lower as bond yields and oil slump. 
Dow -58, -0.2% to 24,753.
Nasdaq +0.1%, S&P -0.2%.

Mkt is up for the week: Dow +0.2%, Nasdaq +1.1%, S&P +0.3%
1803 2018-05-25 20:06:46 Different kind of meat for the BBQ. Ribs, beef, pork and chicken seasoned in different spices. Corn, salads, vegetables in garlic oil. A nice Italian bread .

1807 2018-05-25 20:06:38 "Norway is already leading the way for electric ground transport. It’s now starting to take the lead in electric maritime transport on top of seriously looking into electric air transport." What an innovative nation can achieve with public wealth gained from oil & gas. #bcpoli
1808 2018-05-25 20:06:35 This isn't reporting on a coup, it's attempting to foment one. Due to sanctions, us citizens can't invest in venezuelan oil, and now oil sanctions are being threatened - which this article doesn't mention - what are you talking about?
1809 2018-05-25 20:06:34 I am obsesssd with the clary sage smell coming from my oil diffuser  I can’t get enough of it
1810 2018-05-25 20:06:34 I prefer something that gives me real energy like a good meal. Coffee helps sometimes, but I don't like the shakes from having too strong or too much coffee. No idea about MCT oil (or bulletproof coffee).
1811 2018-05-25 20:06:29 Yeah. Sherman act. You know, last applied in what, 70s? Also totally not applicable to sovereigns??
1812 2018-05-25 20:06:23 His power longevity rests on Chavez' legacy during oil's booming years. Especially, and almost only, among the poorest segments of Venezuelan society.

1817 2018-05-25 20:05:55 The recent high in oil.
1818 2018-05-25 20:05:50 Isn’t it being caused by OPEC underproducing? Of course, we could refine US oil in the US rather than selling abroad to be refined and taxed on its way back in...
1819 2018-05-25 20:05:46 Probably more than 320K jobs dependent on a healthy coast. Problem is blocking KM increases coastal risks. There will be >15,000 ships/year in the Salish Sea (nevermind north coast) including at least 1500 US oil tankers. You are myopically focused on 300 extra KM export ships /2
1820 2018-05-25 20:05:33 @tvnatasha happy birthday. May your dreams come true and the Leafs meet the Oil in next year's final.
1821 2018-05-25 20:05:08 Why don't u sweet precious adorable little innocent Conservative Christians make urselves useful & tell Wallstreet TheSwamp & Globalist to take oil off the stock market so the price of gas doesn't go up because there's a rain storm n the Gulf of Mexico!
1822 2018-05-25 20:04:43 Nonsense. The rich d poor and everyone else need to change their oil sometimes. we only need to know where our priorities lie

1834 2018-05-25 20:03:35 You can not blame just Saudi Arabia for the deaths in Yemen it both them and Iran. Both should be left to fight in the sand alone if not for the oil underneath that could destroy the worlds economies.... so I guess we have to choose a side!
1835 2018-05-25 20:03:27 You can say and spew all you want. But #fact is officially we where in recession under a conservative government and under a lefty government they brought us out. And got us out without $100 oil .

1854 2018-05-25 20:02:03 You want to know what a lasting boost of energy really is? Lower your insulin levels (if you don't, you'll gain fat weight) and then drink MCT oil or bulletproof coffee.

You could also eat slow carbs for a lasting effect but you wouldn't have an instant energy boost.
1855 2018-05-25 20:01:46 Good to hear. Between Crown Oil and a few other enterprises, I’m thinking he should have done OK.

Most oil pundits are from trading firms. The reasons why they have made wrong predictions again and again are: 
1. Incompetent 
2. undisclosed agenda  
3. Lack of visions  
4. Cannot read charts
5. Greedy 
6. Pretty thick skins 
7. And more...
1869 2018-05-25 20:00:07 That’s crazy hippy talk. If we burn all the oil Jesus will come back riding on a pterodactyl.

1872 2018-05-25 19:59:47 Well the big corps got massive tax breaks and they gouge the crap out of us at the pump. WTF is up with that. Quit exporting and keep/use our own damn oil.

1877 2018-05-25 19:59:15 Again! The President of the Senate did his part through the legislative intervention which he so much understood the strength,

1882 2018-05-25 19:58:50 The substances spilled include: small amounts of gas and diesel from the vehicles involved in the accident as well as home heating fuel oil from the truck's tanker. All of these substances are flammable and volatile.

1888 2018-05-25 19:58:20 Again your wrong..... The recession was caused poor USA banking rules. We didn't not have the same rules.Despite Harper trying to change then we survived and oil prices kept us from feeling to much pain other countries felt. Do your homework.

1895 2018-05-25 19:57:12 If Nigeria is a sane society, OBJ, FFK should be in Jail by now, they don't want their Oil block licence to be counseled next year. Reasons
1896 2018-05-25 19:56:56 Studies are ongoing but heavy oil is looking like its easier to clean up from water too; it clumps together in water. Making it easier to pluck or extract in the event of spills. Lighter weight oil mixes with water readily whereas heavy oil can’t.
1897 2018-05-25 19:56:55 This guy should be making robo calls selling snake oil.
1898 2018-05-25 19:56:52 Ratio is around 12 now
1899 2018-05-25 19:56:44 If you're all about Oil get ahead on clean energy.
1900 2018-05-25 19:56:37 It's  raining today. That's Trump fault. It snowed today. That's Trump fault. Oil production is down. That's Trump fault. Obama ceased the trans pipe line that's Trump fault. Oil prices  too low people played off. Trumps fault.  Who writes for Schumer. Grade school kids
1901 2018-05-25 19:56:30 Hold onto your butts: because this is the moment when the peak oil hype cycle fails, as the peak oil hype cycle exists only in our minds as an estimation of what peak oil will do; the actual peak of oil is JUST ahead
1902 2018-05-25 19:56:03 Holding the long oil for the weekend. Its bottoming here good for a move to test the L pivot at least. Regarding Gold will look to buy an entry next week and buy a move in ES looking to go long. Will post charts on the weekend. Have a good weekend all. Cheers
1903 2018-05-25 19:56:03 Remind us how things were under Liebor? We Scots have benefited  from numerous advances and progressive policies. Talking your country down in distasteful. Also 'oil money'-you need to go back to school mate.
1904 2018-05-25 19:55:53 babe got my oil changed & filled my tank. the blesssss. 
1905 2018-05-25 19:55:50 UPDATE: you Harvest it's fat. your lamp is running low on oil.
1906 2018-05-25 19:55:48 Funny that the oil sector stocks don’t rise much when the oil price goes from  $60 to $80 but crap out when it goes from $80 to $76.......
1907 2018-05-25 19:55:48 It only costs about $40 for the oil and filter if you have someone to do it at home.  Takes 10 min
1908 2018-05-25 19:55:47 "The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist."
1909 2018-05-25 19:55:35 You are looting poor people on petrol with huge excise duty. With crude oil price drop the excise duty hike is fetching 1.6 Lakh crores additionally. Similarly GST is an irrational loot. Robbing innocent people and you want call as increase in Taxes ?
1910 2018-05-25 19:54:55 I'm waiting
1911 2018-05-25 19:54:53 Owen just stop!! You have handicapped reasoning powers! Tommy Robinson is a brave and clear thinking man. Britain is corrupt and made a deal with Islam for cheaper Oil. Weinstein is deranged.
1912 2018-05-25 19:54:31 The oil mix should kill objections in the body and soul
1913 2018-05-25 19:54:15 Better oil that bugger up.
1914 2018-05-25 19:54:12 I don't get on with evening primrose oil...

1917 2018-05-25 19:53:59 Hey boo. I’ve been doing it. It’s pretty easy to do vegan as it relies on fat and not heavily on protein . I just swap out cheese and butter for olive oil and eat load of veggies !
1918 2018-05-25 19:53:48 Oil sands extraction is the definition of the word “cleaning up.”  An area naturally laden with heavy oil in the soil and reclaiming it to grasses and trees similar of those that surround it; Wood Buffalo Nat. Park. Unlike strip mining, there is land left to actually reclaim.

1926 2018-05-25 19:52:27 @MbroCouncil how do you go about reporting engine oil been disposed of down drains
1927 2018-05-25 19:52:20 I think that oil was a reason for going there not the bible.  And where were we in the ME prior to 9/11?  Reacting to islamic agression gave bush a good excuse, didnt it?
1928 2018-05-25 19:52:10 99% of my plotting, scheaming, dreaming and big ideas happens in the shower. What better way to celebrate than with some jojoba oil and coconut lather.
1929 2018-05-25 19:52:09 Is oil Earth's blood?
1930 2018-05-25 19:52:07 Not to mention, the High School wouldn’t allow the cannabis oil on their grounds and his dad drove to his school everyday, took him off campus, just to give him medicine that’ll keep him from seizures. The system is fucked everywhere....
1931 2018-05-25 19:51:58 D question was supposed 2 be 4 him,if the legislative are doing their part in ending the strike,does that warrants his tantrums towards the Executive? Does he knows that govt is about dispensation of duties at all arms? Or will the input of the legislative arm only end d strike?
1932 2018-05-25 19:51:46 Covered myself in baby oil so I can take my old tan off but I've got such an urge to just slide along the kitchen floor
1933 2018-05-25 19:51:30 Now imagine if we had free markets in money and energy. What would be the price of oil?
1934 2018-05-25 19:51:30 But if oil bounces back it will all be okay won't it? Ha.
1935 2018-05-25 19:51:29 Petrol prices are similar to UPA 2 era, this Govt added additional taxes which is helping in reducing fiscal deficit.
Recently crude oil prices are high so petrol prices are high, when it goes to uncontrollable level it can be controlled by reducing added taxes and duties
1936 2018-05-25 19:51:28 Like to call it “ swing oil”
1937 2018-05-25 19:51:21 Did you Know...

1946 2018-05-25 19:50:23 It might help you to know that OBama is the wealthiest President we’ve ever had. He grew up in one of the world’s richest households thanks to his adoptive father, oil baron Lolo Sotoro. Barry Sotoro (that’s Obama) is a ⅓ beneficiary of his estate. He ain’t one of us; a fraud.

1950 2018-05-25 19:50:06 You may think they are cute, but here in México you can buy them cooked in their own oil. People call it a medicine :(
1951 2018-05-25 19:50:06 Yes, my old boy Stripe had stiff joints. He got cod liver oil. (VERY smelly, but he loved it). You can get various supplements that are easier to give, but I was buying cod liver oil for the horse anyway.

1955 2018-05-25 19:49:49 Ineos is the world’s largest manufacturer/producer of oil and chemicals. They have extensive operations planned for fracking across the world, and are already actively fracking in other countries.
1956 2018-05-25 19:49:45 Once one pops up there are always more that follow  so I’m just gonna oil up all the time lmao
1957 2018-05-25 19:49:34 No but they're the only vehicle to get you what you want......Scotland would be fucked right if we had Independence, as the oil industry tanked....and ignoring the propaganda we need the oil industry to fit the sums.

1964 2018-05-25 19:48:20 Say no more, olive oil
1965 2018-05-25 19:48:20 CDC is not allowed to put any numbers forward to ask for any budget that could be interpreted as being “for Gun Control” which means any real numbers so the only studies done are skewed and paid for by gun advocates in bad studies of limited data.. so please. Stfu.
1966 2018-05-25 19:48:11 Think of how much dirt & oil builds up on makeup brushes after each use. Wash them with a brush cleaner often.

2043 2018-05-25 19:40:08 So you’ve been living on government subsidies for a long time & the tax payer gravy train ran out? When oil goes back to 140, maybe the market will support these frills & luxuries again. Not at 60 or 80.

2085 2018-05-25 19:34:43 Oil falling through the floor. As mentioned, this whole matter spun on OPEC supply cuts and USA Shale. Russia and OPEC (well, Saudi Arabia) looking to increase production as cuts were not sustainable. Down 4% today. GOJ would have lost $27 million + with a hedge of $75 #allfact
2086 2018-05-25 19:34:39 have to admit am very surprised at the $JBLU whackathon going on with environment, still have faith it goes to 20 with oil & expect oil to drop further, should have grabbed $LUV, its in good spot. 
2087 2018-05-25 19:34:27 Of course they are. We could be using another source of energy but they want to play out the oil for the rich. I think we should all start walking more and refuse to buy gas. Car pool, ride a bike. Anything to fight their control.

2096 2018-05-25 19:32:31 No.  But let's face it, despite the fact prices have been unusually depressed and ALWAYS go up in the summer, the prices are based on oil companies getting hungry for mega profits.

2106 2018-05-25 19:31:33 Not a valid argument. So sick of oil pushers spewing this garbage. Just because oil has been used to make everything we use now doesn’t mean we need to be dependent on it in the future. We must put pressure on our gov’t to stop subsidising oil and bring in tougher regulations.

2169 2018-05-25 19:24:26 Damn oil change is to expensive fuck 60 damn dollars

2175 2018-05-25 19:23:50 Ur pusy has so much mileage on it you’ll probably need an oil change soon. Dirty skunk girl
2176 2018-05-25 19:23:41 Do you understand how the price of crude oil is determined?
2177 2018-05-25 19:23:40 “Nutrition is equal parts what you eat AND who cooked it. Restaurants tend to use more salt, sugar, and oil in their foods to keep you hooked on their product.”
2178 2018-05-25 19:23:28 So the plastic cover under my front tire was breaking and rubbing against the tire. So took my car to the dealership to have it cut away or taken off. Gonna get the oil change since they’re already there. 

Get a text there’s a recall for my dashboard.

Welp.
2179 2018-05-25 19:23:25 Because the government keeps you away from the cure to autism? Maybe we should trade that to you for some oil.
2180 2018-05-25 19:23:24 A bill allowing Oil Companies American AND Foreign to drill off shore 90% around this country.....I can continue as Fox News, Hanity to Limbaugh forgot to inform you. He did abd still doing great harm to this country. While trying to limit free speech for some over others.
2181 2018-05-25 19:23:22 My skin has been on this up and down torture cycle for a few months now. So I finally sit down go through the ingredients of all the different products I'm using. Guess who found the coconut oil in her oil cleanser -____-
2182 2018-05-25 19:23:16 "And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty." ~Luke 16:6 #Jesus #God #Bible
2183 2018-05-25 19:23:15 it’s amazing what an oil change & a full tank of gas will do for you car.
2184 2018-05-25 19:23:10 events of today: 
-slept through my alarm
-finished high school
-found out i had an oil leak when my caf started screaming that i have no oil on the highway 
-got oil but my car locked itself with my keys inside
-currently walking to practice
2185 2018-05-25 19:23:05 No its wrong!he’s against the nation!!!putting the oil’s price up its impossible for the works to work!!!people cant stand this anymore!!!! #EuApoioAGrevedosCaminhoeiros
2186 2018-05-25 19:23:01 What part of POTUS doesn't set oil prices do you not understand?
2187 2018-05-25 19:22:56 Just add 1 ounce Orange oil to a gallon strong vinegar-put in pump up sprayer and it really works.
2188 2018-05-25 19:22:55 Just had to bath Tinkerbell as she had car oil over her and surprisingly she loved it, she’s brand new again
2189 2018-05-25 19:22:53 It would be helpful if you at least mention the the global meltdown of 2008 and the melt down of the price of oil in your study. Give context to the reason behind the numbers if that is not asking too much.
2190 2018-05-25 19:22:53 No I am speaking about mitigation of risk. We should have no fear of progress, it is the only thing that may save the planet, but expanding oil and gas is not progress, it's growth of an industry that is not beneficial. I am not saying stop, just steady, take stock and shift.
2191 2018-05-25 19:22:49 Scratch that gotta get a oil change and my tires rotated 
2192 2018-05-25 19:22:49 Up to a point, Minister. But some enduring principles apply: eg SLOCS/Sea Control vis a vis China’s dependance on oil imports. India certainly ‘gets’ this.
2193 2018-05-25 19:22:46 Yup def wrong. Tho I still think algos playing games trying to get oil down so people spend for the long weekend
2194 2018-05-25 19:22:39 Damn skippy, he is causing the economy and demand for energy to grow faster than the supply of oil can keep up. ECON 101.
2195 2018-05-25 19:22:37 End oil wars and increase education?  What??!
2196 2018-05-25 19:22:33 I didn't get to see like any of my friends today because they kept us in our lunch class because some dicks put baby oil everywhere
2197 2018-05-25 19:22:30 Yours -Jordan -kids health -Jack- homeopathic - essential oil - health new emerging products - gardening - cooking ( btw actually reading a recipe   and making it takes dbl effort)
2198 2018-05-25 19:22:25 You never know with a live show. Just make sure everyone has oil.
2199 2018-05-25 19:22:15 If the price is "plunging" why is the price at the pump going up? Last yr in Virginia the price was $1.80 per gal, now $2.50. Maryland $2.20 now $3. 09. Guess what our biggest export is...OIL? The Alaskan pipeline (paid for by taxpayers) yet we don't see a drop of that oil.
2200 2018-05-25 19:22:14 When you dye your hair yeah, not when you bleach it though, the oil won’t allow it to fully take 
2201 2018-05-25 19:22:09 It seems the drop in oil prices today barely made the news compared to when oil was rising... giving time to the MMs to bail ship  or I am I over exaggerating

2203 2018-05-25 19:22:03 $CVX, $BP, $PSX Oil prices collapsed on Friday morning as news of Saudi Arabia and Russia considering an increase in production hit markets, driving fears that the OPEC production cut deal may soon come to an end.

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
2205 2018-05-25 19:21:56 原油4%以上めちゃ下げ～。ease supply curbs 来月OPECで減産緩和？
S&P, Dow lower on oil plunge; chipmakers lift Nasdaq/Reuters
2206 2018-05-25 19:21:50 yeah oil is ded until June unfortunately.
2207 2018-05-25 19:21:49 Did you know...

About 30% of global oil production comes from offshore sources?

2210 2018-05-25 19:21:20 Key phrase in Andrew Wilson’s report is about exploiting Scotland’s national resources - such as oil and gas. As well as chairing #GrowthCommission, Wilson’s corporate lobbying firm represents #fracking giant Ineos.
2211 2018-05-25 19:21:18 my hair drinks up so much water & oil, that's why it grows so fast 
2212 2018-05-25 19:21:08 All the more reason to ramp up efforts to find an affordable replacement for oil instead of sanctimoniously protesting  pipelines.
2213 2018-05-25 19:21:07 Lets have a Royal Rumble, Crom, I'll bring the baby oil and speedos.

2218 2018-05-25 19:20:21 Hmmmm oil oil oil.  China, "AGP was created to build and connect a gas pipeline between Central Asia and China, and the Technical Advisor purported to provide independent engineering consulting advice and other services to AGP."
2219 2018-05-25 19:20:15 Do you?
If you do then please tell us. 
I'm sure premature death and oil will figure in your story.
2220 2018-05-25 19:20:13 Considering he prob gets 10 × the death threats of previous directors. Blame the loony left.
2221 2018-05-25 19:20:12 I do hope that he sincerely changed his views on gay marriage as that was over 10 years ago in 2006. As for the female oil wrestling, what is the scandal there? Do people think it's demeaning to women? That part doesn't bother me.

2223 2018-05-25 19:19:56 Is this project to be built with private funds or government monies? Does SHALL need to sell more oil to finance this scheme for you?
2224 2018-05-25 19:19:51 It doesn't make any difference who the POTUS is Mike ! They do this crap every year at this time & Thanksgiving gouging the American public during family holiday time. They claim we're the world's largest oil producer & blame this garbage on other nations. BS ! Liars !
2225 2018-05-25 19:19:46 I feel like you're straight up trolling me. Are you saying that our readers should be left blind in the dark and have no knowledge of global events? We're a business publication and global politics will stir the market. Oil in particular is heavily dependent upon the country.
2226 2018-05-25 19:19:38 @Arsenal49notout Jimmy, we’re signing a player from juventus and I thought  they meant Uruguay but it’s a team in ITALY, it got me all confused. Crude oil has tanked and has got me nervous. Hope you and the family are well mate.
2227 2018-05-25 19:19:26 Absolutely agree with service up selling. Had to go to main dealer for a software upgrade on radio & it came out with an oil leak, coolant leak & two bulbs that needed replacing for £20. I topped up the coolant & wiped the rocker cover & ignored the ‘dim’ bulbs that still work.
2228 2018-05-25 19:19:25 Do all those natural deep conditioning recipes work or am I gonna look like a goddamn fool putting eggs and olive oil and whatever into my hair

2230 2018-05-25 19:19:14 Oil prices are going up for spring/summer like they do every year due to "high demand." The price hike is a scam.

2233 2018-05-25 19:18:53 No......the oil companies are flexing their economical and industrial might.....just in time for the memorial day weekend.  You can count on it every damn year at this time....just like death, taxes, and mosquitoes!!
2234 2018-05-25 19:18:43 Every time I say something, someone says there is an essential oil I can use for that. Omg essential oil is not the answer to everything people back the fuck off lol
2235 2018-05-25 19:18:42 "While data may not be the new oil, it certainly wields power in virtually every facet of society, from business and technology to government and infrastructure. In the age of cyberattacks and data breaches, personal information is under the microscope more than ever."
2236 2018-05-25 19:18:40 no to insecticide! Essential oils work! Try a blend of lemongrass and eucalyptus oil....anything that isn't 100% all natural should never be used... thanks for sharing, Jordan. And yes, this asinine treated clothes is bullshit. Cancer coated clothing...no thanks!
2237 2018-05-25 19:18:35 Maybe one day, a smart person will say, we produce enough renewable energy, who cares oil prices?!
2238 2018-05-25 19:18:30 Looks like mooch poured a bottle of olive oil over his head

2246 2018-05-25 19:17:29 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
2247 2018-05-25 19:17:20 Reasons why I don’t ride buses: the person’s head in front of me tends to have oil sheen as if he or she forgot a spot a day before.
2248 2018-05-25 19:17:15 Have you gotten your three servings of coconut oil today? Bonus points if it's sustainable.
2249 2018-05-25 19:17:05 Do we say as well “add oil to fire” ?
2250 2018-05-25 19:17:03 Not because he is Muslim, but because he is an Oil partner with Bush.
2251 2018-05-25 19:16:58 That may have something to do with the fact that city were penniless and mediocore for most of that period until the oil barrens made you what you are. No disrespect to city as a club but any club with that cash injection could probably do the same.
2252 2018-05-25 19:16:58 I've used a deodorant spray; it helps with the  chaffing. Or just lots of baby oil haha
2253 2018-05-25 19:16:51 Fixed my AC in my truck today too, so I suppose that combined with changing my oil the other week means it's safe to say my chest hair count will soon exponentially increase
2254 2018-05-25 19:16:41 Again oil prices= OPEC. US POTUS has no control over an internationally traded commodity...economic 101

Just a parasite, really. 
2286 2018-05-25 19:12:35 Oil prices fell about $3 per barrel on Friday as Saudi Arabia and Russia  discussed easing supply curbs that have helped push crude prices to  their highest since 2014.
2287 2018-05-25 19:12:33 सर, अब लग रहा है कि आप BJP के MP हो. ना कोई logic ना ही Fact. बस फेंकते चलो. Please compare cruid oil price and tax rate also.

2298 2018-05-25 19:11:37 The oil tanker driver in #ThelmaAndLouise reminds me of Duterte, not just in looks, but because after all Dutz have said about and done to women, I could definitely imagine him ogling women in a highway just because they're women, and he's a man. 
2299 2018-05-25 19:11:36 Not necessarily hypocritical: journalism is a specialized job with specialized training. If everyone knew how to change oil in their car, we wouldn't need mechanics, but that's not how our society is built. There's a Tesla joke in here somewhere....
2300 2018-05-25 19:11:13 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2301 2018-05-25 19:11:05 It's not even that, I thought everything else was cool and that we could've done more but I really just think the baby oil was slightly over the line, like it's just dangerous

2309 2018-05-25 19:10:13 You people who advocate primers and powder before primer don’t understand that the drying effect makes you produce more oil 
2310 2018-05-25 19:10:12 If you have wavy hair, a light weight conditioner like coconut oil is my recommendation. It will not weight your hair down and help strengthen your hair. #hair #haircare #hairdresser #hairlife #beauty #sabeautysupply #delawarestylist #delawarehair #delawarebraider #hairsalon
2311 2018-05-25 19:10:07 え、君顎あるの？顎ってやっぱりどこかで買うの？僕顎持ってないんだけど。
2312 2018-05-25 19:09:59 There could be a boycott on Trades people from BC who work in the oil patch maybe Horgan should think about that when it come to memployment
2313 2018-05-25 19:09:55 I used superdec for years then move on the Allcoat for faster drying times.  I find over time the wb finishes go powerdery rather than blister or flake like an oil. With all these products, we're spoilt for choice 
2314 2018-05-25 19:09:34 No lol sweet almond oil is unscented….if it has one it’s not pure….BUT that’s what i use to moisturize every day….it’s not greasy & your skin absorbs it really well
2315 2018-05-25 19:09:27 Gas prices have been up for a while even though oil was cheap. Nothing but greed
2316 2018-05-25 19:09:18 Those lies about Iraq and they never found WMD it was all a lie to steal their oil, then it was Libya now they want to steal the Gas In Syria and the US attacks the Syrian Army as soon as they get to strong for ISIS so maybe watch some real news and get the truth.
2317 2018-05-25 19:09:15 I am comparing the current climate change skepticism bankrolled by the oil industry to previous skepticism about smoking’s link to cancer bankrolled by tobacco industry.  See Merchants of Doubt by Orestes/Conway.
2318 2018-05-25 19:09:13 I will defend the path of the ancestors, achieve the goals, lionize the honorable and  prevent the sectarian to line-up, divide oil wealth between the people fairly, take Iraq away from poverty drought, external interventions and all the parties.

2319 2018-05-25 19:08:57 hahahahaha remember when you used magic oil? 
2320 2018-05-25 19:08:56 We just the old motor oil out of our bus....

2327 2018-05-25 19:08:29 For those that missed the first rally in oil stocks.  Get your shopping list ready.  The quick downturn seems more like profit taking then a change in trend.  $XLE $OIH
2328 2018-05-25 19:08:29 Horrible down candles oil silver etc. Remember that  $ bulls. As extended as oil was and I was waiting for pause/pullback although not as deep as this, that is how extended the $ is. Not shorting it yet but i think the reversal is 1 at the most 2 weeks away...
2329 2018-05-25 19:08:19 Oil Prices Reverse Their Rise, and Drivers May See Relief
2330 2018-05-25 19:08:15 Like I’m just over here trying to have nice skin and messed around and let all these natural oil heauxs on YouTube get to me so now i got the  sunflower oil i put on my face all in my eyes and I might need to go to the hospital cause my iris’ on fire 
2331 2018-05-25 19:08:00 I am a beautiful ball of water right now, prospering. throw all the oil you want

2333 2018-05-25 19:07:49 What could be your worry, don't you also understand the commitment and responsive attitude put forward towards ending the JOHESU strike by @Bukolasaraki is commendable. Let reason beyond sentiment.
2334 2018-05-25 19:07:38 Btw short NG probably way less pain from here than short oil the last few weeks
2335 2018-05-25 19:07:35 I hope that is the truth, so the Oil can trade Lucic for Kessel.
2336 2018-05-25 19:07:35 That’s pretty standard for dealerships.  A lot of shops do it for cheaper, but alot of people don’t trust the work they do because they “can” put shitty motor oil in your car and not change your filter.
2337 2018-05-25 19:07:33 Was really thinking about getting a gti in July but thinking about the 60 dollar oil changes(for supplies) I give to my car plus having to maintain the stupid turbo. Think I’m going to have to pass :(
2338 2018-05-25 19:07:32 Why does @jacindaardern think a career studying oil and gas sets anyone up to produce alternative energy or work in tourism? Or does she not think that but knows NZ media too lazy to look into it
2339 2018-05-25 19:07:29 @reaIDonaldTrunp hello Donald I have lost a thousand pounds on the stock market today, due to your increase of oil in USA, I am so not happy with this old mate
2340 2018-05-25 19:07:14 - ถ้าวันไหนที่ออยไม่ไหว ออยขอยุห่างๆเดินจากไปเงียบๆก็แร้วกันนะ เหนื่อยมามากพอละ เข้าใจและแคร์ความรู้สึกเราบ้าง 
2341 2018-05-25 19:07:05 Hi Irwin. I’ve said on the show I don’t think Chavismo has created any of Venezuelans problems (reliance on oil, lack of production etc.) but after almost two decades in power has solved none and made most worse.
2342 2018-05-25 19:06:57 No, I mean to say government to maintain its fiscal discipline did not pass on the benefit of lower crude oil price. Because if you compare FD from 2014 (~5.1% of gdp) to now 3.2% of the gdp. During 2913-2014 sharp decline in current account deficits as due to curb on gold import
2343 2018-05-25 19:06:55 This makes me sooo mad. Cbd oil doesn't have any kind alterung effect??? Who cares
2344 2018-05-25 19:06:47 There is a dispensary about a mile from my house that sells $15 grams of fire oil! #ILoveOregon
2345 2018-05-25 19:06:41 if olive oil is made of olive, vegetable oil is made of vegetables then what's baby oil made of?
2346 2018-05-25 19:06:38 I hate the smell of coconut oil but I will never use anything other than that to shave with ever again. So worth it 
2347 2018-05-25 19:06:38 It’s called price gouging.....by the oil and gas companies
2348 2018-05-25 19:06:36 I hate getting oil changes at the dealership because they always take their sweet friggin time.
2349 2018-05-25 19:06:30 Really easy to make ... oil is too ;)
2350 2018-05-25 19:06:23 I need to find a good oil for my scalp  nothing works
2351 2018-05-25 19:06:09 What else besides coconut oil is good for keeping hair moisturized cause my hair dries out too quick especially with this color.

2354 2018-05-25 19:06:01 Pigs are stupid smart. We had a semi feral herd of pigs on the farm I worked at. 

Initially they rolled in mud to prevent sunburn then they discovered the oil disposal pit. We could not keep them out of it. 

They rolled in it ~10:30 every day to prevent sunburn
2355 2018-05-25 19:05:53 Beard oil is the biggest invention of all time
2356 2018-05-25 19:05:50 Isn't coconut oil like thick? I need something that's more liquid so I can just pour the highlighter in the bottle.
2357 2018-05-25 19:05:49 What would be more important: paying the bills and the debt or increasing oil price - Putin is a cash 22 situation if he keeps promoting @NicolasMaduro
2358 2018-05-25 19:05:35 Gas $1.31/l  could go up as much as 9 cents today.  The kicker... we refine oil in my city. (4L to a gal)
2359 2018-05-25 19:05:34 I'll supply the coal oil.
2360 2018-05-25 19:05:31 @etfopresident wants us to support NDP candidates who call for a 15% cut to teachers salaries, involved in female oil wrestling, use Hitler quotes on social media, express anti-semitic views, refuse to wear a poppy, call for a war on Christmas. This speaks much about Sam Hammond!
2361 2018-05-25 19:05:28 Lavender oil baths are actually another level 
2362 2018-05-25 19:05:13 Try rubbing alcohol to take it off. If that doesn’t work put some oil on them before you go in so it wipes off.

2365 2018-05-25 19:04:59 I bought a new bottle of tea tree oil its been a gracious day.
2366 2018-05-25 19:04:52 He’s thrilled.  Oil prices up, money is flowing again.  Putin’s dream come true
2367 2018-05-25 19:04:11 Tom Steyer has donated a tiny fraction of what oil and gas companies have already thrown into this election so this article is extra stupid.
2368 2018-05-25 19:04:06 I would rather be at home in my onesie enjoying the rain than at work. On the other hand, I've learned it's better to be stuck at work than stuck looking for work. With that said. I'll turn my radio up a lil louder and plug in my oil warmer lol
2369 2018-05-25 19:04:04 When was the last time this team had  consistent ,solid goal tending? The D needs imprvmnt for sure but there were many nights where bad goal tending killed us . If you look at D.S'. record since he's been with the oil &  you look at his cred .. there's no way he should be there

2371 2018-05-25 19:03:38 Why haven't the straights made mascara wand lids for beard oil yet?
2372 2018-05-25 19:03:32 All the savings from #Trump tax cut going to the oil companies. Action needed now.

Flynn in backdoor deals with Ukraine. Manafort backdoor with turkey. Junior tried to get dirt on Hillary from Russians. On and on
2375 2018-05-25 19:03:03 Nigga doing my oil change made me hot as Fck with these damn timbs on
2376 2018-05-25 19:02:57 Got it, thx.  Bounce will coincide with oil rebound imho so sounds bout' right
2377 2018-05-25 19:02:53 coconut oil
2378 2018-05-25 19:02:51 Unless other factors exist that make domestic refining of Kenyan oil not viable, rush to export crude oil via trucks & this soon lack logic.

By refining oil domestically, Kenya would save more dollars than it would gain in export of crude oil & would grow allied industries.
2379 2018-05-25 19:02:33 My social anxiety is ON ONE rn. Can I please get an oil change at my house with no one around like it is 2018. If I don’t wanna interact with humans I shouldn’t have to @god
2380 2018-05-25 19:02:33 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
2381 2018-05-25 19:02:32 I didn't forget Alberta and stand by my description. Were they progressive, they'd be cooperating with neighbours to implement more effective ways of gaining revenues from oil & gas production. Instead, they've been leaders in the race to the bottom. #bcpoli #abpoli #skpoli
2382 2018-05-25 19:02:12 so, are these the people who will attend and put the fire out when the #Tarsands catches on fire?
Would like to hear the plan for that. Oh and the plan to only capture %15 of an oil spill on the west coast.
2383 2018-05-25 19:02:06 If you want to learn something, maybe go talk with the 20 million people in east Africa currently in the grips of a climate-fueled famine while middle class white Americans gorge themselves on beef and oil. Then consider whether racial justice and climate change are related.
2384 2018-05-25 19:02:05 The determination for sovereignty over water for oil and gas exploration has always been an issue.
2385 2018-05-25 19:01:44 I have the perfect highlighter to turn into a body shimmer, but I'm not sure of what kind of oil to mix it with. 

Any suggestions?

2394 2018-05-25 19:00:39 These guys need to get a communications director. Letting the market know that they need to get to 2.7b in oil inventories to keep the market balanced is all that needs to be said. Prices will stabilize in the long run as soon as they get to these levels.
2395 2018-05-25 19:00:38 Oil drops to $76 from $80. So that means based on the rise up to $80,  at the pumps, this reverse means we should see a 2p fall. Will we? I predict those pigs will still be flying  @FairFuelUK @steve_hawkes @Kirstene4Angus @halfon4harlowMP @peter_aldous

Using the same logic as used by @rahulgandhi. The states should be ready loose their tax part first. Because right now only cusion available to control impact of sudden increase in crude oil price is excise duty.

2413 2018-05-25 18:58:21 i love that you attempted to make it look like there is oil on the ground.  

The guy pictured in the photo has clean pants, t-shirt, and arms.  Next time at least rub some dirt on him.  

Did you just spray water on the ground and hope people would have "faith" that is oil?

2441 2018-05-25 18:56:06 By age 35 you should have used olive oil to get your dick into a fat chicks ass.
2442 2018-05-25 18:55:49 Our crime rate in a 4,000pop ranching/oil town? .04% of the national average.We all packed six shooters or better. Town Nickname? Outlaws (Marlow Ok )
2443 2018-05-25 18:55:43 Remember drill rigs are frac fleets are two different beasts, when it comes to actually pulling oil. Not saying frac fleets have declined since egress issues, but that is the pointy end of the stick, not drill rigs.
2444 2018-05-25 18:55:37 You need to adjust figure for the drastic fall in crude oil price in international market. once you do that, petrol price loot will show up.
2445 2018-05-25 18:55:22 the cute tech who did my oil change, bought me lunch and gave me a kiss in the rain . must be love 
2446 2018-05-25 18:55:21 getting oil change, you? RT @imkermitheaux: What y’all doing?

2450 2018-05-25 18:55:04 @Dev_Fadnavis Bhutan can offord to give petrol in just 52 rs per litre to their citizens.... 
Then why you can not reduce tax on petrol..... 
Or India provides petrol to Bhutan from Indian oil company......
2451 2018-05-25 18:54:44 They don’t sell Castor Oil where he’s from
2452 2018-05-25 18:54:37 Well, and what happens when Russia starts to run out of food and looks to the oil fields opening up in the arctic due to sea ice melting. I'm glad I'm not in scandinavia rn.
2453 2018-05-25 18:54:22 Never have I heard a dentist reccomend me coconut oil pulling yet it's one of the most effective natural ways to whiten teeth and clean your mouth.
2454 2018-05-25 18:54:15 Bush 1 it was about oil. Bush 2 it was about opiods. Clinton it was about gold and human trafficking
2455 2018-05-25 18:54:10 Burlington Coat Factory actually has a nice seasoning and oil selection lol
2456 2018-05-25 18:54:04 จมูกลอกทำไงดี ใส่ทั้งเซรั่ม,moisturizer, argan oil ยังไม่หาย
2457 2018-05-25 18:53:53 US stocks down as we approach the final hour of trading, but havens like gold and the yen are suffering as the dollar shows a spike in strength. Crude oil responding in kind, helped by Russia & Saudi Arabia output concerns, down more than 4%.
2458 2018-05-25 18:53:53 i meannnnn mine was the bco & flaxseed oil  might not cancel it
2459 2018-05-25 18:53:53 Being a plumber is where you go around with a pipe opening boreholes & hope your pipe is long enough to reach water. It's like dowsing crossed with drilling for oil
2460 2018-05-25 18:53:29 India stopped importing oil from others, the oil in use is what we mine out of oil deposits all around us, not enough hence price hike.
2461 2018-05-25 18:53:25 @talkcric Our Government & Masonic filled security services sold us out to the house of Saud for it’s oil pipeline war in Syria. Same caveman head choppers say they want a democracy in Iran & Syria. They already have it but not American style democracy.
2462 2018-05-25 18:53:25 ugh... i hate working from home when everyones home ...... this is all my bros fault for having his fkn oil change today ...... ggggjgj
2463 2018-05-25 18:53:13 I mix it with like a cap full of black seed oil and warm water
2464 2018-05-25 18:53:13 Need to oil Mother soon. Get all the hard-to-reach places.
2465 2018-05-25 18:53:07 One thing we won’t have to ‘suffer’ are ill informed fools like you. England is panicking that Scotland is going to leave. The £ will drop 15% when it’s no longer backed by oil, they have a lack of natural resources, and will be buying Scottish water, electricity, gas, etc.
2466 2018-05-25 18:53:05 put some weed oil in my little brothers fish tank & the lil nigga died 
2467 2018-05-25 18:52:53 Let’s see if gas prices drop with the oil at the same rate they went up with oil.

2470 2018-05-25 18:52:28 For sure. As bad as the oil companies and auto industry can be, car safety is light-years ahead of gun safety, likely because we don't culturally deify cars to the extent that we do guns.
2471 2018-05-25 18:52:25 terrible.  25% loss so far.  gald its just 1 contract.  whats the deal with the market?  is it oil tanking thats causing this all day fade in SPY?
2472 2018-05-25 18:52:21 I was gonna guess hemp incense and coconut oil but that's probably accurate too
2473 2018-05-25 18:52:14 Thanks! I acknowledge your valid argumentation. Nevertheless I'm still interested in doing the experiment of adding 1 drop of any essential oil to yoghurt, kvas or kefir while fermenting. Adaptation to the oil may give the bacteria unusual qualities and capacities, I hope.

2480 2018-05-25 18:51:34 @narendramodi Jab Bhutan petrol 52/53 rs per litre petrol de sakta hai to why indian can not..... 
Or Indian provides petrol to Bhutan by Indian oil company........
2481 2018-05-25 18:51:31 Let me think.... Oh yeah I know why. Because a majority of Scottish people don’t want that. If it had happened the fall in oil would have meant economic ruin. That’s why.
2482 2018-05-25 18:51:30 With battery now advancing beyond expectation, as research and development, have become in a nation's interest! The farce of the antiquated internal combustion engine, and the oil that has powered it, is coming to an end!
2483 2018-05-25 18:51:27 I dont think this will win you votes when the debate starts

Trouble is as soon as i say words like deficeit or currency, fishing waters, oil price your mask slips
2484 2018-05-25 18:51:26 Great to hear! A welcome upgrade, thanks.   Now, about those oil tanker you are going to force into their territory - anything you can do about fixing that hazard?!    Asking for a lot of First Nation friends!
2485 2018-05-25 18:51:23 Politeness Is The Oil Which Reduces The Friction Against Each Other.
2486 2018-05-25 18:51:22 Not sure I agree.  Yes there are more pipelines being installed in the NE but those have been in development for years.  I also haven’t seen any up tick in NG drilling and fracking in PA.  That employed many people before oil crashed in 2014.
2487 2018-05-25 18:51:22 I'm tweeting to finish what I'm saying I have come up with a way to have self sustained energy using magnets  no oil use bearing grease and a regulatory system that no one can cheat I will only speak in a controlled environment with the U. S. Government number 714 2909429
2488 2018-05-25 18:51:15 Yes i agree with you. There are other also important things to be looked into.Why during Congress people didn't speak about Oil Price hike why ?

2491 2018-05-25 18:50:45 They met the economy at its worst state ever, the forex market was crashing, crude oil prices at less than the value, from 2 million barrels a day we were producing 700,000. They’ve stabilized the economy, everything is on the up. So please what are you on about?
2492 2018-05-25 18:50:26 Having a car is exactly the problem I expected. I have to get new tires and windshield wipers and OIL CHANGED EVERYTHING SUCKS ABOUT HAVING A CAR IT COSTS ME MORE MONEY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
2493 2018-05-25 18:50:23 My dad does the same shit lmao. In Spanish like "can you believe this pendejo doesnt know how to change his own oil"
2494 2018-05-25 18:50:00 coconut oil water and sunshine
2495 2018-05-25 18:49:59 The crude oil is waxy. It will be very costly to install a pipeline that would transport such crude.
2496 2018-05-25 18:49:56 Yeah so it just low on oil, just gotta add some. You dont run the risk on overheating but rather your motor seizing up
2497 2018-05-25 18:49:56 Rising prices for "crude"? And why is that? Because Big Oil says so. And why? So they can excuse a 15% increase  (in profit) during the heaviest driving season. Happens on all holidays and periods of higher driving. All about the greed of Big Oil & everyone knows it
2498 2018-05-25 18:49:55 I wash my face with clean & clear morning cleanser in the morning and the night one at night, and then I put coconut oil on my face as moisturizer
2499 2018-05-25 18:49:49 Got a wild bill, got a ticket, and my oil light just came on. I hate being an adult.
2500 2018-05-25 18:49:32 I’m sick that it may be true but I’ve read a lot about an oil pipeline Clinton Obama wanted through Syria that they needed to destabilize Syria to do, also the CIA outpost in #Benghazi was buying weapons that’ve  been proven to have shown up in ISIS hands. Blood on a lot of hands
2501 2018-05-25 18:49:17 Fresh brake pads and rotors, oil change, full tank of gas, top off, road trip..... THANK YOU

2506 2018-05-25 18:48:58 See a spike in tweets on issues such as oil prices, NOTA, aadhaar. All issues which pin govt & on which many r dissatisfied with the govt. Only problem is those tweets don't appear genuine & appear to be from opposition moles egging ppl against Modi. There is no a very thin line.
2507 2018-05-25 18:48:38 The blunt truth is summarized in less than 4 minutes, growing from a garment factory to the biggest edible oil manufacturer in east and central Africa. Not sure what more could an aspiring entrepreneur ask for!”
2508 2018-05-25 18:48:38 @realDonaldTrump  just quick note . that the dem have distracted you from the price of oil which in turn makes gas could you look at that so I can afford to drive for my food and meds . thanks Al @alantruax51

2511 2018-05-25 18:48:29 Well England can keep its oil reserves. You haven't answered the question: why do they want to hang onto us so badly. Oil prices go up and down, currently they're up. Successive UK gvts have mismanaged the massive amounts of money from oil.
2512 2018-05-25 18:48:29 I’m got my oil changed today too. And yes that feeling is the best 
2513 2018-05-25 18:48:22 What oil is this ?? Asking for a a brotha
2514 2018-05-25 18:48:12 Caompare crude oil prices too
2515 2018-05-25 18:48:12 Wow....especially coming from a rural school.  That’s so disappointing when so many earn a livelihood in rural Alberta from the oil industry.   Maybe the @AER_news could do a road show to schools and educate these young minds on the benefits.
2516 2018-05-25 18:48:07 The tree oil works but I’ve noticed that for me it’ll keep coming back unless I have real gold or  medical grade surgical steel in bc I have sensitive skin

It defeats economies of scales no matter what level

2548 2018-05-25 18:45:35 See I think that is a cynical argument over oil.  Scotland was part of the UK long before oil was discovered.  Also, England found huge oil reserves in West Sussex in 2015.  But that aside remember Salmond's oil price prediction was wrong in 2014.
2549 2018-05-25 18:45:29 Can I change my own oil? 
Absolutely 

Would I rather pay someone else to do it while I sit back and watch them like they’re my servant? 
Absolutely

2556 2018-05-25 18:44:10 And his claims are true, the east coast oil isn't subject to the same tariffs as Alberta for equalization, and neither is the Hydro in Quebec..they get exemptions for some reason.
2557 2018-05-25 18:44:02 I don't even allow them do these media stuffs

2559 2018-05-25 18:43:33 So looks like the dollar is going to blow up, oil will bomb (this is the last hurahh) and I be out of work in an emerging market  (europe).. 
Can they print enough money to feed all of us ??
2560 2018-05-25 18:43:28 Wtf Honda?! You told me 2 hours for an oil change which was fine, but I’ve been here for 4 hours! Livid! 
2561 2018-05-25 18:43:25 Ok, it’s my front room. I just saw you in front of that US committee about oil for cash thing and got a bit emotional, the other guy has been quite cool lately too.
Sorry
2562 2018-05-25 18:43:16 Thank you
2563 2018-05-25 18:43:10 You don't fill it, if you can determine line in ground where tunnel is (yes, technology exists), drill holes and drop a lit stick of dynamite down the hole. No fuss, no mess, spontaneous combustion. Might even find oil.
2564 2018-05-25 18:43:02 Keep it ungovernable so they can get cheap oil.
2565 2018-05-25 18:42:58 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
2566 2018-05-25 18:42:58 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2567 2018-05-25 18:42:56 So high demand worldwide and no spare capacity, in contrast to an increase/lower output in OPEC production is a reason to stay bullish in oil markets in the medium term? Thanks!
2568 2018-05-25 18:42:52 @FoxNews higher gas prices is not all negative, if it's explained that the cost of production to becoming energy self-sufficient requires this level of prices for drillers to be able to afford to drill. I was hauling crude when oil went to $30 a barrel in the Bakken so I quit too
2569 2018-05-25 18:42:52 You sold your constituents out. How long until beautiful @AcadiaNPS is drilled for oil?
2570 2018-05-25 18:42:49 But hey none of it is their fault. They sold the largest amount of snake oil in history, full of undeliverable lies & half truths. The ploy was that the UK was such a big fish that could have all the benefits of being in the EU but with none of the obligations. #BrexitShambles
2571 2018-05-25 18:42:31 Good to see that the tax breaks oil companies got are trickling down to offset the higher costs (caused by Middle East uncertainty) and help shield consumers. That's how it's supposed to work right? #VoteBlue

Thats why I can eat kibbee-nayee w/olive oil, Lebanese flat bread, salad for lunch.
2577 2018-05-25 18:41:54 What a contradictory statement by person who owns fleet of high end oil guzzling SUVs worth crores of Ruppes?  I don't think you have any impact if petrol price goes up to 200 Rupees per litre. You will drive your SUVs irrespective of petrol price.
2578 2018-05-25 18:41:51 Price of crude oil was more than 140$ per barrel during MMS and @PChidambaram_IN regime which is now on 75$

2581 2018-05-25 18:41:37 getting my car fixed, cleaned out, oil changed, vacuumed, and washed as a form of self care
2582 2018-05-25 18:41:32 Ya, I don't believe that. Nations that rely on oil export for $$ always wants a higher price.

2585 2018-05-25 18:41:03 what oil u use?? asking for a friend
2586 2018-05-25 18:40:58 So proud. Indianyouth is lit
Just like Asifa got justice (hope many others), we believe, sharing posts and writing  hates will obviouslysolve any issue like the popular Oil price hike. Simple haan?
.
Not against any party or Govt but certainly against our mindset
2587 2018-05-25 18:40:55 normally drilling results includes important facts like:

"How much oil did you find?"
"At what oil price can it be recovered economically?"

@zionoil IR currently wants you to believe the deadline means "Did you drill a hole" - to which @zionoil answers "Yes a really big one!"
2588 2018-05-25 18:40:54 OIL CLOTH SALE Table cloths, bags, pillows & aprons (coming soon)
2589 2018-05-25 18:40:48 Can athletes that are competition tested for PED's take this CBD oil and still pass all the tests?
2590 2018-05-25 18:40:43 Whatever respect the Alberta NDP may have had, is destroyed by Notley's vile rhetoric, she is out Kenneying Kenney.  She lost her NDP cred with her decision to go all in and back big oil.  She has viciously attack Horgan almost daily and now the leader of the federal NDP Singh.
2591 2018-05-25 18:40:41 A white man up until the 60s could come out of middle and high school and earn a wage high enough to support his entire household with little or no skill working in factories or primary industries such as mining or forestry. Frankly the oil industry is the same today.

2594 2018-05-25 18:40:22 .@realDonaldTrump said in a speech the other night that America is now net exporter of energy. If so, why is the price of gasoline going through the roof? Because oil is fungible? What happened to "America First"? Someone's benefiting, but it sure ain't me. @FoxNews
2595 2018-05-25 18:40:21 In case anyone is wondering, about 50% of ALL ocean-going cargo is hydrocarbons, most of it being oil.  That is the dimension of the problem.  Of course those interests will buy media mouthpieces wherever they find them...
2596 2018-05-25 18:40:14 $66 for my engine oil
$62 to get gas 
$45 for full service at the Pennzoil station....

This truck is killing me today

2600 2018-05-25 18:40:03 I’m trying so hard to fight these tears and stop myself from having a breakdown at this oil change place
2601 2018-05-25 18:40:00 If it is oil based primer, at least it smells kind of good
2602 2018-05-25 18:39:55 Amazon (1994), Apple's revival under Steve Jobs (1997), Netflix (1997), Google (1998), and Facebook (2004) all got their start within the span of a single decade. Other than the breakup of Standard Oil, I can't think of so many huge companies sprouting up at the same time.
2603 2018-05-25 18:39:52 Every time I come get a oil change I have to get something else done too
2604 2018-05-25 18:39:45 I'm looking at 66.90 as an important level for oil. I'm guessing these OPEC+ guys will reconsider their comments during the weekend.
2605 2018-05-25 18:39:44 Diesel Fuel is 4.06 a Galonia. Diesel is an oil which is not part of the refining costs as Gasoline is. These costs r B S .  Being in Ca certainly does not help. The #POTUS stated we are now exporting oil. Put the oil into our system & get the costs down.
2606 2018-05-25 18:39:28 exit oil 67.83
2607 2018-05-25 18:39:26 If you don't mind the grey being done in a water-based rather than oil stain (both this & the last have been oil-based) then I can do either a slate grey or a silver.   ....black straps on grey body, I assume?
Give me a day or two and I'll dye a sample on scrap & photograph it
2608 2018-05-25 18:39:18 Been here.  Nice place... close to shale oil deposits.  Went to the top to scout out choice land to lease off for small $ to our gvmt ? Then of course the oil co will make millions in profit then claim to have no money to reclaim/restore so tax payers get hosed again.. sigh
2609 2018-05-25 18:39:16 Only a oil change again, hopefully they be quick it's Friday and daddy wants to start drinking.
2610 2018-05-25 18:39:09 Breaking:  Assemblymember Muratsuchi's #AB1775 and Senator Jackson’s #SB834, bills to fight Trump's offshore oil drilling plan, passed out of their respective Appropriations Committees today. They will be eligible for floor votes next week. #BigOil #oilmoneyout #BrownsLastChance
2611 2018-05-25 18:38:52 Yeah I totally agree, the main stream media is bought by big auto and big oil.
2612 2018-05-25 18:38:50 Oh the scents of traveling southern highways! 
Is that oil? Nope... It’s a massive dairy farm. Both sides of the road!
Production of milk for the nation?
2613 2018-05-25 18:38:48 Where can get a oil change at rn
2614 2018-05-25 18:38:44 Can only go on what the experts say. Questions I would ask are why does England want to hang on to us so badly and what makes us different from other small independent nations? Apart from - oil reserves; renewables; tourism; food; whisky; etc. We have more riches than most.
2615 2018-05-25 18:38:34 The man who changes my oil could **** **** *****
2616 2018-05-25 18:38:32 please check the indian oil petroleum website and you where the price from 1 march 2014 when modi ji were not in rulling and till now and also check price from 2004 to 2014 there is hike of 35 ruppes approx in petroleum price in congress govt.
2617 2018-05-25 18:38:27 MAGA the nazi racist party they should call yourselves the Racist Party. 
Like trump they call all brown ppl even children MS13 to justify their hate.
trumps & Kushners sure do love brown rich oil thugs they take their $ & bow to them tho using the US Gov to personally pocket $
2618 2018-05-25 18:38:21 do not put words in my mouth - i didnt say why bother fixing. even if all countries switched to clean energy, which wont happen (good luck convincing the leaders earning profits from coal, oil etc), it’d take 1,000 yrs to reverse effects,sea levels will still rise, ozone depletes

2625 2018-05-25 18:37:27 so is oil wrestling is also hard right?
2626 2018-05-25 18:37:22 You can throw some mozzarella on a sheet and bake it, drizzle with olive oil...kinda trashy but chewy and delicious.
2627 2018-05-25 18:37:15 Evenly spread underdevelopment should prompt quest like

1. Why are the ND States still a mess after collecting 13% derivation for, say the past 18 yrs?

2. Why is the FG still a mess after collecting 52% of the crude oil money for the past 18yrs?

3. Why is the rest of Nig..8/
2628 2018-05-25 18:37:08 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS mr. President I am also a self-employed business owner. I drive for a living and this is not good for us middle class sir. Let's release some oil sir
2629 2018-05-25 18:36:52 i turned abbachios wine into olive oil. thats for the piss you dick
2630 2018-05-25 18:36:44 Actually 2 days was the real drop.... same shit each time. Its oil that is what it does. Try Natural Gas its times 10....

2632 2018-05-25 18:36:35 yeah because i just bought this huge tub of argan oil eco that i cant get rid of just yet lol
2633 2018-05-25 18:36:34 The cost of life has being increased because of oil price. Glad to see oil is under profit taken $SCO $DWT
2634 2018-05-25 18:36:30 need to oil my scalp  probably do it after I shower
2635 2018-05-25 18:36:24 I hate the fact that we depend on oil but we cant escape the reality that we cant live without it either. We should reduce the consumption tho and not fully rely on it 
2636 2018-05-25 18:36:12 Crude oil falls under $70 and Brent Crude below $78.!!
2637 2018-05-25 18:36:11 Come back no oil change, her car smell like hella weed, anddddddd the gas light on
2638 2018-05-25 18:35:58 #channel4news Hopelessly biassed report on possible Scottish referendum.  Ended on not 1, but 2 once-'yes' but now 'no-leaning' interviews.  Ended with dark, sombre warning from reporter.  Face it, you don't want to lose the Kingdom & Scots oil!
2639 2018-05-25 18:35:58 Really! So we have no water, electricity, renewables, IT industry, fishing, salmon, linguistine, whisky, gin. oh and some oil and gas? All of which England would collapse without. What resources does England have?
2640 2018-05-25 18:35:53 I wonder why sex bloggers (this includes me) and phone calls mix like oil and water? Is this mandatory to join our secret society?
2641 2018-05-25 18:35:49 Getting my oil changed. Hope they don’t judge the amount of empty Chick-fil-A cups in my car :~)
2642 2018-05-25 18:35:46 No fizzy drinks, McDonalds, KFC, Subway, dairy or chocolate. 2L of water a day, tea tree scrub two or three times a week and I use @TheGlowPot cedarwood and neroli moisturizer instead of coconut oil. I steam every Sunday and change my bed sheets weekly. I think that's it.
2643 2018-05-25 18:35:35 How about seeing this jackass out of his appointed position in the SWAMP? Better enjoy these monument and NP's now, before all the oil rigs and heavy machinery shows up.

2645 2018-05-25 18:35:14 Like the part in Spaceballs....water, water, oil, oil, room service, room service. Sorry been watching it a lot lately lmao
2646 2018-05-25 18:35:06 I am completely convinced that natural coconut oil moisturizers are the best lol And they smell good, too. :)
2647 2018-05-25 18:35:06 Unfortunately for Putin(really Sechin), oil markets and bonds/debts denominated in dollars. Trickery with gold doesn’t do anything to the dollar.
2648 2018-05-25 18:35:06 Let people do what they like, the way people eye me badly because I want to eat bread and Gbegiri is strange, is gbegiri not beans and palm oil?
2649 2018-05-25 18:35:04 I take one full dropper of oil under my tongue twice a day - first thing in the morning, and late in the evening.

2658 2018-05-25 18:34:18 334
2659 2018-05-25 18:34:10 Yup oil for you. Have to admit though this one was the toughest of them all getting into a dip. I might still step aside and wait for confirmation if this last bid fails Im stepping aside...
2660 2018-05-25 18:34:10 Big big question. America is now exporting oil and other energy products. Why is our gasoline prices increasing? I understand California putting more taxes to pay for illegals new healthcare, but why other states hikes. Less exports, cheaper gasoline for us, gets my vote
2661 2018-05-25 18:33:56 Bug Guard Alert!!!  I have a few cans on hand for discounted price along with some sunscreen. Also have Skin so Soft bath oil
2662 2018-05-25 18:33:53 Here's an idea for your next project! Oil pastels + trees + plans + pattern! Go!
2663 2018-05-25 18:33:47 Ummmm if Canada doesn’t supply the world with oil, some other country will. It’s that simple. Stopping one pipeline will only benefit OPEC and the US (inter Alia)
2664 2018-05-25 18:33:46 The Deep State mostly consists of NON ELECTED leaders of Alphabet Agencies and Large Companies (Big Oil, Big Pharma and FED). Congress is filled with paid puppets.
2665 2018-05-25 18:33:45 Perfect... duh to totalitarian style dis-information of the Stalinist mindset persuasion!  (Now the domain of big oil and their lackeys, with not a care for the damage they do...)
2666 2018-05-25 18:33:41 I just noticed my chapstick has cannabis sativa hemp oil in it  blazing and hydratin
2667 2018-05-25 18:33:38 Oil for funds.

2669 2018-05-25 18:33:36 So glad I stocked up on healthy freezer food last week before the wedding! Have a bad dose of cold/flu so fighting it with homemade chicken curry from freezer, fresh basmati and poppadoms. Plus usual hot lemon, raw honey and ginger! Echinacea, Vit C, oregano oil, zinc 
2670 2018-05-25 18:33:36 I am taller than KAI... I guess that peaches helps you grow better than curry and chili oil...
2671 2018-05-25 18:33:27 We have a deficit within the union. A deficit created by the WM handling of our revenue. In 2015/2016, when oil price was low, Scotland raised £43 billion in revenues. £31 billion was passed back under Barnet. Do the sums.
2672 2018-05-25 18:33:26 I just got an hour long massage & she used coconut oil & I stepped outside into the sun & my skin legitimately looks like a glazed donut 
2673 2018-05-25 18:33:23 If Saudis and Russians start exporting more oil, that should be good for tanker rates, and therefore tankers like $TNK , correct?

2679 2018-05-25 18:33:00 is it baby oil or is it sweat
2680 2018-05-25 18:32:59 $MMEX up 25% still below half a penny get your golden tickets for the ride of the first oil refinery built in over 40 years in America! When they are producing 150,000 barrels of oil per day you'll be glad you got your shares at less than half a penny!
2681 2018-05-25 18:32:56 @realDonaldTrump

They know what thier doing and it's antiamerican 

@POTUS
2682 2018-05-25 18:32:52 Do you guys read your 10-k?

Because we have.  

You need to report the drilling results, aka if you found any economically recoverable oil by May 31!

2690 2018-05-25 18:32:13 I can see the misunderstanding here as Ole Miss fans don't have to spend an hour rubbing olive oil into their CLANGA arm so that their arm flaps don't chafe by the 5th innning.

2693 2018-05-25 18:32:06 @StevenageBC just to let you know someone has left oil at the recycling centre behind emporers head and it’s leaking everywhere. Very slippery and dangerous
2694 2018-05-25 18:32:04 LOL they have saying that since 55 oil blah blah OPEC this that this that Im sick of it just follow the charts they tell the story. Simple as that they always do...
2695 2018-05-25 18:32:00 Fadalud I need oil on my head.
2696 2018-05-25 18:31:51 The only problem with that is Taylor and Burton were fiery characters. With Shula & Alistair you’d need all the oil in the UAE to get a smolder going. #thearchers
2697 2018-05-25 18:31:49 Wytch farm pioneered horizontal drilling! They've wells going out 10Km! It is both irresponsible & deceptive to suggest a fracked site will be somehow "different" to Wytch farm. The countryside impact (fear-mongering aside) from UK regulated oil/gas exploration is negligible.

2699 2018-05-25 18:31:25 @EricTheCarGuy  Hello @EricTheCarGuy , It's Clint Hightower again.  I have a new product that I think is much more up your alley than the book, it is called The TurboFlo Oil Changer.  It is an electric fluid transfer pump that has an integrated priming system. Will you review it?

2702 2018-05-25 18:31:12 Nah, they tell you to char-broil it, wrap in foil to let it get smoky, then peel the skin and drizzle with sesame oil so it's got flavor, which actually sounds way better than what most veg*ns of my acquaintance have come up with.
2703 2018-05-25 18:31:07 Olive oil and rosemary?
2704 2018-05-25 18:30:53 Car and oil companies obviously have a lot of power and influence over car and industry media.. and it's the story of power: the first thing once something gains power is it figures out how to keep power..

2713 2018-05-25 18:30:00 Toby decided to cook a steak for tea tonight and to check if the oil was hot enough in the pan he poured water on it. He actually has the common sense of a shoe and now the whole kitchen has smoked up
2714 2018-05-25 18:29:58 If you followed fundamentals in OIL and Natural Gas you were broke a long time ago...

2717 2018-05-25 18:29:41 @NBCMontana Whatever happened in that Evaro oil spill KECI mentioned last night?
2718 2018-05-25 18:29:25 that'd be pretty cool; if it wasn't a snake oil pit of deception I'd say that would be a perfect application of these cryptocurrency contracts/tokens/etc
2719 2018-05-25 18:29:25 WTF dude,
We don't want to export oil off our vulnerable coast,
That's all! It's so fucking simple,
Alberta wants to put Canada first, let's refine these products and use them here?
2720 2018-05-25 18:29:24 It's snake oil pretending to be "truisms" using oversimplification and misrepresentation of science to justify itself as something profound.  It's... bullshit defending expansion of the status quo
2721 2018-05-25 18:29:21 I will defend the path of the ancestors, achieve the goals, lionize the honorable and  prevent the sectarian to line-up, divide oil wealth between the people fairly, take Iraq away from poverty, drought, external interventions and all the parties.

2722 2018-05-25 18:29:16 But I got that free oil change shit so I’m gonna just do this free one and go cancel the plan right after fuck that I’d rather pay than drive 20 min then wait another 2 n half
2723 2018-05-25 18:29:16 YASSSS!!
2724 2018-05-25 18:29:12 HE GOT OUT OF THE IRAN DEAL... RUSSIA WANTS IT.. DONS GOING TO GET MONEY FROM QATAR STOCK OF A RUSSIAN OIL COMPANY BOUGHT.. HE KILLED DOOD FRANK BILL ..TO COVER THE MONEY TRAIL UP WHEN HE STARTED @FBI
2725 2018-05-25 18:29:09 That’s where I am now! He done asked me did I want this done that done I’m like no, no, no.  now I’m sitting here an hour after an oil change to get something else done.
2726 2018-05-25 18:29:05 I already watched it
2727 2018-05-25 18:29:05 I will defend the path of the ancestors, achieve the goals, lionize the honorable and  prevent the sectarian to line-up, divide oil wealth between the people fairly, take Iraq away from poverty drought, external interventions and all the parties.

2728 2018-05-25 18:29:03 Got my car cleaned out, smelling good & tank on full  next I gotta get my oil changed.
2729 2018-05-25 18:28:56 I’m getting my oil changed and they tried to sale me a new car. Girl bye 
2730 2018-05-25 18:28:55 MR Trump superman please int oil pricing can to high pricing each drum set to us 100.00?
2731 2018-05-25 18:28:53 When we talk about @realDonaldTrump against the press, I obviously side with the press!
But @elonmusk vs the press is a different story: Musk is actually important to humanity lol, and every car and oil company specifically plot against Tesla
2732 2018-05-25 18:28:52 Great for oil and balsamic when you're having a cheeseboard night!

2734 2018-05-25 18:28:49 Under UPA, oil subsidy bill was 2.5 lakh crore!Higher subsidy=Higher fiscal deficit=Higher inflation=Lower purchasing power
Under @narendramodi
oil subsidy is less than 50000 cr
Now u know why CPI was 12% under your inept gov in 2013 & is only 4.58% now
2735 2018-05-25 18:28:42 Airport made me throw my coconut oil away.. they don’t wanna see a king shine
2736 2018-05-25 18:28:36 Came to the shop to get one of my brake lights replaced & got a free oil change as well, my day has been made. 
2737 2018-05-25 18:28:35 WTI oil holding off > -4.0% as Saudi Arabia & Russia review production caps to fill restricted/ reduced output from Iran & Venezuela.

2740 2018-05-25 18:28:21 @Channel4News Pathetically biassed report on poss Scottish referendum.  Report ended with not one, but two(!) interviews with folk who voted 'Yes' last time - but now lean towards 'No'.  Report closed with sombre voice of reporter.  Face it, you want your 'Kingdom' & Scots' Oil!
2741 2018-05-25 18:28:18 Not saying your charts are bad, in fact they are good for normal conditions. But this is a fundamental shift in oil. You should def. incorporate some fundamental knowledge, especially if your trading oil.
2742 2018-05-25 18:28:06 How I read his comments were the #Conservative's did not have a balanced #Oil/#Environment plan, the main reason #Kxl was not approved.

Also that the #CPC did not build any pipelines to international markets.

2743 2018-05-25 18:27:57 Maduro in  Venezuela is trying to introduce a sovereign crypto that will be linked to their huge oil reserves. So it will not be a mere token. Controversy surrounds this move & lets wait to see if they succeed
2744 2018-05-25 18:27:55 How about @KarenStalba in at no. 1 after Q1? Solid effort. @Lucas_Oil @maplegrove
2745 2018-05-25 18:27:54 Seriously it doesn’t take 2 hours for an oil change
2746 2018-05-25 18:27:37 Labour.... lying to Scotland about its oil since it was discovered
2747 2018-05-25 18:27:18 $80 for an oil change?! I’ll sale this damn car lmao
2748 2018-05-25 18:27:11 Waiting to get my oil changed and an older lady started a conversation and said you got any kids you look pretty young?  How old are you 35 ?
2749 2018-05-25 18:27:09 Whilst in all honesty I wouldn’t let Ruth #rapeclause run the bath. Tell me UK / England’s credit rating when no oil, gas, etc

2751 2018-05-25 18:26:54 As a follower of oil that trash presentation was high theater at best. It's like trump was trying to outdo Netanyahu and showed me how easily everyone drinks the drama koolaid. I'll be changing mental gears from analytical to idiocracy next time they put the makeup on.
2752 2018-05-25 18:26:43 miso + sherry vinegar + olive oil is the perfect salad dressing
2753 2018-05-25 18:26:35 Hold your horses Chuckles. Wait to see what oil does a week or two after Aramco is listed here. I'll bet it plummets back down. Think a little.
2754 2018-05-25 18:26:35 Remember that "Big Environment" is a business, too!
Oil and gas resources have helped industrialization, and benefited Native communities with jobs and royalties, instead of welfare.
2755 2018-05-25 18:26:33 FUN FACT: I hate doing maintenance on my car... I’d rather get a new car. 

Oil change : New car
New tire.    : New car
Windshield wipers : NEW CAR.
2756 2018-05-25 18:26:32 Ummm if we don’t get Canadian oil to market then other countries will simply meet the increasing demand. What you’re suggesting is nonsense given we live in a global economy
2757 2018-05-25 18:26:29 He's bipolar or just selectively stupid. I wouldn't put much into what he says on any given day.

2759 2018-05-25 18:25:57 All similar sized countries have the largest gas and oil deposits in Europe?
2760 2018-05-25 18:25:57 I hate running because I get so sweaty it feels like someone dumped 2 bottles of baby oil on me
2761 2018-05-25 18:25:56 Spot on. I worked for an Irish oil contractor years back & guffawed daily. The number 33 just kept cropping up in meetings.
2762 2018-05-25 18:25:56 I had a Nissan Almera 1.5 sport. It wasn't sporty but it was indestructible. It didn't matter if you ragged or or drove steady it got 32mpg used no oil ever and just kept going. Boring car but the lads in Sunderland build a good motor.
2763 2018-05-25 18:25:45 They're trying to show that scotland would be fine with or without oil money it seems.  Strong move
2764 2018-05-25 18:25:38 does anyone in rexy have some true blue essential oil I can use??? I tweaked my back and now I can't move :')
2765 2018-05-25 18:25:35 I couldn’t begin to explain why the Obama WH didn’t do more. All I can see is what this treasonous, corrupt GOP is doing to America for Russian oil money.
2766 2018-05-25 18:25:33 i should not be allowed to take my car for an oil change. needs coolant? go for it. want full service? why not. then i look up & the mechanics are all just shaking their heads... help
2767 2018-05-25 18:25:31 Super disappointed with @pepboysauto today. Scheduled an appointment in advanced and was told today when I got there that they didn’t have time for me unless I could leave my car there for hours. All I needed was an Oil change and inspection 
2768 2018-05-25 18:25:09 Oil prices are tanking right now.... don’t you follow business news?
2769 2018-05-25 18:25:06 Oil is cracking, more relevant right now for yields/stocks. Stocks are rangebound, bonds are rangebound. Nothing seems very out-of-whack.
2770 2018-05-25 18:24:53 I have no doubt. That and greedy oil companies.
2771 2018-05-25 18:24:46 ,I think the sovereign wealth fund&the excess crude oil account has taken care of this need. Prudence is critical
2772 2018-05-25 18:24:45 A little drastic, maybe try V05 hot oil treatment
2773 2018-05-25 18:24:42 You do know oil and gas are running out so what is your plan to change to an alternate energy as well? ExxonMobil’s climate action plan keeps us on a path to an unlivable planet. @exxonmobil what are you doing to curb global warming and keep us safe? #ExxonAGM
2774 2018-05-25 18:24:40 i think this is political move with a big headline, OIL down 4% so the masses will gas up their cars and Trump the hero.  next week it wouldnt surprise me if it bounced alot, maybe not to the highs but this is politics in front of long weekend
2775 2018-05-25 18:24:32 
E cost sha. 
But you don try clean palm oil comot from time before?
2776 2018-05-25 18:24:31 Bout oil down. 
2777 2018-05-25 18:24:27 Blame the oil morals for price gouging and raising gas prices $1.00 dollar in two weeks. Get you gas at Costco, .40 cents a gallon cheaper, that's $8.00 dollars more for a large tank of gas, then go have lunch
2778 2018-05-25 18:24:24 The cost of car manufacturers, oil producers and refineries not interested in their responsibility to put their profits into infrastructure, research and development.
2779 2018-05-25 18:24:02 Norway only got oil the oil fund in 1990. They’ve had the benefits for decades longer.
2780 2018-05-25 18:23:50 @LoveWilko Do you have this Wilko Danish Oil 1ltr 0252295 in 1lt or 250ml in your Cambridge store?
2781 2018-05-25 18:23:38 Do you know what saves time on oil changes?  Not having to do them at all.  It’s been 9 years for me.  Drive #EV
2782 2018-05-25 18:23:38 Oh gimme a break! Stop deceiving yoselves we know you don't care.. You never really cared! All y'Guys care 'bout is oil.. If not you would'a intervened & stop the ethnic cleansing tha has been going on in #nigeria.. Asked 'bout #NnamdiKanu & #Zakzaky and prevail on @mbuhari Govt!
2783 2018-05-25 18:23:12 Not BS. I was in Detroit in 70's, had gun pulled on me twice. Neither time did I report it. Just wanted to b about my business without delay
2784 2018-05-25 18:23:07 I mix it with warm water and black seed oil
2785 2018-05-25 18:22:58 tea tree oil can burn in the right concentrations, so you were on the right track
2786 2018-05-25 18:22:55 Pretty sure you're just trying to stir up some shit while you wait to get your oil changed. ;)
2787 2018-05-25 18:22:54 Chevron you do realize oil and gas is running out? Chevron’s climate action plan keeps us on a path to an unlivable planet. @Chevron what are you doing to curb global warming and keep us safe and what's your solution to no more oil and gas? #ChevronAGM
2788 2018-05-25 18:22:47 Yes! Far less bites than normal. The dry oil body spray which handily for me also calms sunburn!
2789 2018-05-25 18:22:37 The oil bearing communities truly deserve more
2790 2018-05-25 18:22:36 Our VP just said 'many states will collapse without Oil income (which by the way - 80% of these states do not have nor produce)' - how does one analyze this kain thing?
2791 2018-05-25 18:22:34 Coconut oil!
2792 2018-05-25 18:22:25 Why does my car require such expensive oil changes? 
2793 2018-05-25 18:22:06 I rub mine with oil and let it sit for an hour, takes away the bitterness and makes it softer
2794 2018-05-25 18:21:58 Skyrocketing revenues as well buddy! Thanks to the NDP we now have a thriving province again. Oil prices up, employment, 5% GDP growth, biggest in the world! If you don’t like it move
2795 2018-05-25 18:21:55 Big data is the new oil
2796 2018-05-25 18:21:52 Right. Data is not an extractive industry. Oil is. 
But bear in mind that not all data is personal. Industrial data and environmental sensors are also a part of the picture
2797 2018-05-25 18:21:49 If you go back through history almost every holiday season fuel prices go up. Almost with every president since Jimmy Carter has that happened. Do the Senators remember the hearings with the big oil companies a few years ago. Price gouging, taking advantage of the people
2798 2018-05-25 18:21:46 How many times have you seen this move in OIL. Its oil this is what it does. Get use to it.... This is not a trend reversal yet it is NOT CONFIRMED. Still above the 50 and the 200 NOTHING CONFIRMED YET.
2799 2018-05-25 18:21:46 I always saw Nier blood as being an oil or fluid in the body casing for cooling and mobility that happened to be red. Even thematically it was used sparingly. The Detroit androids are near-future consumer grade for around $3k and Cage is doing dick all with semiotics
2800 2018-05-25 18:21:36 No oil in hair.
2801 2018-05-25 18:21:35 #MAGA is @GOP snake oil. But they can't stop drinking it.
2802 2018-05-25 18:21:33 Without Iran deal, where does Supreme ldr get $s. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei set conditions Wed 4 Iran stay in deal: unless Europe guarantees Iran oil sales will not suffer,Tehran would resume enrichment activities currently prohibited. deal lets Iran enrich under tight restrictions.

2830 2018-05-25 18:18:54 #oil futures are down by 4%, hope it also reflects at the pump when every one hits the road during this long weekend to start off the summer season.
2831 2018-05-25 18:18:47 NP. I doubt the EIA saw the oil crash coming, so they did get lucky in 2015 when cheap oil slowed up hybrids.
2832 2018-05-25 18:18:35 Can you teach me how to trade oil ?
2833 2018-05-25 18:18:29 That was my first reaction. You have to marinate them a long time in the oil and vinegar and I use liquid smoke as well as various spices (didn't read the article's recipe) which take out any carrot taste. Basically they become like a sponge for those flavors.

2845 2018-05-25 18:17:22 Oil made from organs would be my guess. Used to tune and maintain pianos or piano like instruments?Probably more of the latter, but I'm keeping it interesting for now.
2846 2018-05-25 18:17:14 แต่ลาออกล่ะคงไม่ได้ไป
2847 2018-05-25 18:17:10 Yes, but they have no buying power. I hardly believe they will buy your cheese with their oil.  Be real.
2848 2018-05-25 18:17:06 Check yourself Bloomberg...... oil at $67 SMH 
2849 2018-05-25 18:17:06 Oil Changed.  Gas Tank filled.  Let the weekend begin!

2853 2018-05-25 18:16:32 Stop starting them then for oil
2854 2018-05-25 18:16:23 hey @NCAA -- time to "get with the times" and look at your policies. c.j. harris needs that cannabis oil for legit medical reasons. to deny him the opportunity to play football for such a short-sighted reason is just wrong.
2855 2018-05-25 18:16:12 "En 1937 murió John D. Rockefeller,  
 dueño del mundo, 
 rey del petróleo, 
 fundador de la Standard Oil Company.

 Había vivido casi un siglo.

 En la autopsia, no se encontró ningún  
 escrúpulo".

2856 2018-05-25 18:16:08 Yeah man they were basically giving it away. Literally mint condition. Brand new brakes, tires only like 6 months old. Oil just changed. Just needs a new gas cap. But they only 30 bucks.

2858 2018-05-25 18:16:00 Really? Spoiled, Mr. Trump In 2016, Canada was the largest foreign supplier of crude oil to the U.S., accounting for 41% of total U.S. crude oil imports and for 20% of U.S. refinery crude oil intake.
2859 2018-05-25 18:15:58 And I didn't put that much oil in my hair
2860 2018-05-25 18:15:56 that feeling after shaving and lathering yourself in coconut oil >
2861 2018-05-25 18:15:53 Oh yeah? Well i am from #Africa and i 've gat news for you.. There's nothing good 'bout Africa. Africa is a sh*thole(especially #nigeria) and 'll remain a sh*thole! Y'Guys don't really care 'bout what happens down there in nigeria do you? Ofcus all you care 'bout is oil! Nonsense
2862 2018-05-25 18:15:53 And we can put punitive tariffs on US products too. One thing is for sure that the EU will work closer together with Russia (oil&gas) and China in the future. America will be isolated-so sorry about it. But the USA needs a market overseas too for all the products.
2863 2018-05-25 18:15:49 Invade us, we still have a bit of north sea oil, make us you 51st state. Please, I'm not joking

2866 2018-05-25 18:15:18 Just me covered in olive oil 
2867 2018-05-25 18:15:14 Yes, I do have #AppsurdCats who are rescues. Sphynx cats love human companionship. Their breed is described as monkey, dog & child. Think about that. They need a bath every week because no fur to absorb oil. They need human, blanket, heating pad windowsill Cat TV is a bonus.
2868 2018-05-25 18:15:08 It's so hard to lose eight as a brown person because the food we eat has more oil than SAUDIA ARABIA.
2869 2018-05-25 18:15:03 USA is equally responsible for damaging Venezuela's economy as Maduro is, US want to destabilize Venezuela oil market to  occupy market for  its own Shale oil and gas. Also creating chaos in any country benefits US economy in many ways.

2878 2018-05-25 18:14:18 You would prefer to be beaten to death or stabbed? Hands/feet, hammers, knives kill roughly 2000 a yr. More socially acceptable?
2879 2018-05-25 18:14:18 ahaha thank you!!! but i just rotate between biore (baking soda kind) for the morning and cetaphil at night. then i use a toner and bio oil for moisturizer. i also use black soap like twice a week in the shower !
2880 2018-05-25 18:14:09 examples of NON KINGS:

2885 2018-05-25 18:13:42 Sardines' natural defense is to secrete a thick oil and encase themselves in a tin. Nature is weird
2886 2018-05-25 18:13:29 Me: oooo Mac and cheese is on this menu and it has truffle oil. I bet it's amazing!

2887 2018-05-25 18:13:26 So let me get this straight. Ottawa's solution to killer whales going extinct is more oil tankers but less salmon fishing?
2888 2018-05-25 18:13:20 At the oil change place and CSI is on in the waiting area. If these people don't quiet down so I can watch my show.... I swear ta gawd
2889 2018-05-25 18:13:16 The NRA spent millions making sure no one can study gun usage. #fact
2890 2018-05-25 18:13:15 Where's the troll who said he wanted to buy #WTI crude #Oil @ $71? lol
2891 2018-05-25 18:13:11 Maybe because they can afford lower oil extraction costs. While USA need an higher margin to cover their costs.
2892 2018-05-25 18:13:08 I've now discovered that a shitty book about an abusive relationship masquerading as a kink tale has outsold a wordy "self-help" book of snake oil, oversimplification and scientific misrepresentation by a factor of 50.
2893 2018-05-25 18:13:07 They may have referred to some of it's accurate statements but I will tell you as a matter of scripture, one cannot mix oil and water and call it pure.  I suspect they taught what Jesus said and some of what HE said could have been intermingled. Lucifer intermingles truth w lies.

2896 2018-05-25 18:12:54 It’s obvious that you have not read the report. No oil money! When in fact it goes into a separate fund, why the need to lie?
2897 2018-05-25 18:12:50 Is the executive claiming innocence? Wasn't 41 oil contracts just awarded a year to election. Let no one claim holier than thou. Everyone chops

2900 2018-05-25 18:12:36 A bunch of hogwash. There are reasons we are not allowed to study it... because the NRA lobby wants everyone to believe the fiction. Only one side fights studying the data. The side that is lying about it.
2901 2018-05-25 18:12:31 Oil goes in the black part and it you click the button to heat it up. The glass is the mouth piece
2902 2018-05-25 18:12:28 Ya, we didn’t get the reaction we want because he was so mad about the baby oil but I asked him and he said he loved it.
2903 2018-05-25 18:12:24 Snake oil sale men. Keep talking about it and the foolish will follow. Like you always say have to do your homework, know what you are buying!
2904 2018-05-25 18:12:21 I already drained the oil silly. But I got the filter off and new one on and all is good now  thanks pumpkin
2905 2018-05-25 18:12:18 Yeah it’s great stuff.  Use it religiously in a 2013 Silverado.  Runs like a champ-never an oil leak or burned a drop.  Maybe I got lucky & got a tight engine from new but the Mobil 1 is keeping it healthy.
2906 2018-05-25 18:12:17 Who called the top on #oil last week hehe!
2907 2018-05-25 18:12:15 I got an oil change today so i'm feeling very responsible

2909 2018-05-25 18:12:04 "Colombia is doing better than most voters think. Its economy is recovering from a slowdown that began with a drop in the price of oil, its biggest export, in 2014. Nearly 5m people have escaped poverty since 2009": .@TheEconomist

2912 2018-05-25 18:11:37 elliottwave set up does not lie...human behavior is repetitive, thus patterns form from these behaviors are recognizable.. EW was extremely prescient on oil, did EW knew russia n saudi was gonna lift oil output?? think so... it was forming an ending diagonal 5th wave..

2917 2018-05-25 18:10:42 Thats how I knew yall was lying. Ive used ecostyler's black castor oil & flaxseed oil gel for 6-7 months and my hair is even thicker...
2918 2018-05-25 18:10:34 Nah came in for 10k miles oil change - they try this every time - like $330 to rotate and balance, but this one made me make a scene
2919 2018-05-25 18:10:34 Happens 500, 000 times a yr on low end firearms used defensively. You just don't know it.
2920 2018-05-25 18:10:29 Research Genie Oil and look at who sits on the board. Research Trump’s connection to the Rothchilds. Trump is in this for himself.
2921 2018-05-25 18:10:27 Imagine getting your daughters oil changed for her and you get arrested cause she got weed in the car
2922 2018-05-25 18:10:27 I can't get this fucking coconut oil out of my hair. Washed my hair like 9 times now and it's still oily/greasy 
2923 2018-05-25 18:10:26 yes, the owner is a nice guy and maria (i think) is always hella nice when I go. I always go back and get my oil changes there too for the low.
2924 2018-05-25 18:10:21 a goddamn tree should be able to sue an oil company for climate change
2925 2018-05-25 18:10:19 Crude oil is falling today as the bullish enthusiasm about Iran sanctions and Venezuela’s production difficulties are being offset by rising US production, rising US inventories and Russian comments about starting to boost production again. (1 of 3)

2931 2018-05-25 18:09:58 Working from dealership today as I, along with the entire population of Seattle, attempts to get their oil changed ahead of a holiday weekend. It might be faster to just buy a new car at this point.
2932 2018-05-25 18:09:51 I cannot wrap my mind around the idea that people actually believe this snake oil salesman. That’s what has me incredibly depressed.
2933 2018-05-25 18:09:47 So, the IARC puts a ton of time and money researching this chemical, only to determine that glyphosate COULD be carcinogenic. That's the same determination they made about coconut oil. Yet, the same people who demonize Monsanto, purposefully cook their food with it. Funny!!!
2934 2018-05-25 18:09:45 It's a great and funny video and they're a great band!
2935 2018-05-25 18:09:39 The forward curve will be lower today due to the big drop since Wednesdays EIA oil report. (2 of 2)

2937 2018-05-25 18:09:25 Currently learning in school why Albertas oil industry is bad. Interesting.....
2938 2018-05-25 18:09:02 Been hearing that news months ago. One thing I don't like though is Trump calling oil to high. If anything he can be a deciding factor will see but nothing tells me just yet not to buy the dips. Until then I am...
2939 2018-05-25 18:09:00 Yes, but not just his pockets.  
tRump pulled out of the Iran deal. (wish Fred Trump had pulled out...) 
Oil prices went UP 
Money flying across the Atlantic to Russia
Putin can now fund Russian agenda. Trump, paying his tab. 
2940 2018-05-25 18:08:56 I encourage you to convince us that having a fossil fuel industry lobbyist armed with a "wish list" of demands from the other oil & petroleum CEO's heading up the @EPA is going to work out well for us and our future. Go ahead, try.

"Run government like a business" is flawed.

2943 2018-05-25 18:08:34 Every dollar per barrel change in crude oil prices impacts the import bill by Rs 823 crore (USD 0.13 billion). The same is also the impact when currency exchange rate fluctuates by Re 1 per US dollar.
2944 2018-05-25 18:08:31 Just because you think its a myth doesn't mean people don't still hang themselves. In a world were sociopaths have power and innocent people are bombed for oil but every1 still needs their car your not normal if your not a little depressed. #jogle4mind
2945 2018-05-25 18:08:29 Hi Ms. Irene, ipabukal ug maayo ang oil, igawas ang kalha with gabukal2x na oil, ilunod ang bulad, takluban (para contained ang kainit and smell), let it cook then hukaron. Iwas baho sa sulod sa balay. All worth it. 
2946 2018-05-25 18:08:27 After a shower I love to oil up and get back in bed for a few min.
2947 2018-05-25 18:08:22 Always hated onions growing up. Now however, love em to death! The smell of onions frying in oil is just pure bliss.
2948 2018-05-25 18:08:19 Dawgggggggg I still told this girl and she said that's why I left baby oil at yo house

頭痛い…
2951 2018-05-25 18:08:10 At the same time, I suspect it's because you can chose between proven existing technology and infrastructure to make money on oil, or invest in something that might not make money. So make money for sure, or maybe don't are the choices.
2952 2018-05-25 18:08:00 Hmhmhm.

Of course he followed.
She wasn't surprised. He was like a little duckling.

She grabbed a bunch of ingredients. Onions. Eggs. Flour. Oil. Hamburger meat. Cheese. Noodles--

Lettuce, tomatoes, pickles.

Different seasonings...
And then set them all on the counter +
2953 2018-05-25 18:07:59 Who came up with oil changes?? Why are they so expensive?? Why do we pay $20,000+ for a car and it can’t change its own oil??
2954 2018-05-25 18:07:58 For high end products: carols daughter monoi collection and for more affordable: tresemme botanique line and ogx coconut miracle oil line

2958 2018-05-25 18:07:38 Oh no! It takes a long time for oil to become rancid.
2959 2018-05-25 18:07:30 Happens daily. Most times weapon is NVR discharged. Many go unreported just bcse ppl want to move on with their day. 500, 000 times a yr
2960 2018-05-25 18:07:29 But with that being said. It’s summer time and people travel more. Prices always go up. They will raise and lower and then in the fall they will go back down. Presidents don’t make the price. That would be the oil company’s.
2961 2018-05-25 18:07:26 India had imported 213.93 million tonnes (MT) of crude oil 2016-17 for USD 70.196 billion or ₹ 4.7 lakh crore.
For 2017-18, the imports are pegged at 219.15 MT for USD 87.725 billion or ₹ 5.65 lakh crore

2963 2018-05-25 18:07:20 Oil is very hard to trade lots of shaking but when it moves it moves same to the downside. Its all about managing the trade and using your stops. Lots of shaking in oil not for everyone to trade including Natural Gas.

2967 2018-05-25 18:06:33 Liberal Democratic Party moving forward with policy change that would classify military "strike capability" as somehow in legal conformity with "self-defense." No doubt it's a concept similar to how Pearl Harbor was "self-defense" against the US oil embargo. (MP) #SelfDefense

We put most of our eggs in the #canadian short basket. We had a small $oil bit when the floor dropped out.

Lol feeling a little cheated in the $usdcad trade

Still waiting
2970 2018-05-25 18:06:02 Well buying the dips like some have including myself since the 40s its not yet telling me rhe run is over yet to the upside. We have been banking on oil since the 40s I have at least. The news do the opposite usually pans out...
2971 2018-05-25 18:05:59 @IATA - you guys are handing this to airlines that do not deliver any valuable customer service. Shame on you. What criteria have you used? This airline failed an oil & gas industry assessment, and you can still give them an award?
2972 2018-05-25 18:05:54 I see it as we are getting older and older. I had a piece of toast with mozzarella, olive oil, and tomatoes slices. And then I read your tweet and felt so damn old.
2973 2018-05-25 18:05:45 Yeah I can’t make that. Oil change on the other side of town before the family stuff even starts. Sorry man.
2974 2018-05-25 18:05:43 ive had the explorer since august, just got the oil changed for the first time  #oops
2975 2018-05-25 18:05:21 BC reputation is already in tatters . Suing to not get oil through the pipeline ... also suing to get oil through the pipeline .... uh wtf over .
2976 2018-05-25 18:05:18 It makes me wonder why any members of OPEC would want Iran to actually negotiate with US.  Russia and Saudis probably hope Iran would be placed on sanctions again.  If it does, would oil price actually go higher, despite this record spec long.

2996 2018-05-25 18:03:10 India’s net oil and gas import bill, i.e. adjusting for exports of petroleum products, amounts to around 2.5% of GDP, higher than India’s overall current account deficit and hence plays a big role in determining the dynamics related to the balance of payments.

2999 2018-05-25 18:03:02 I dabble in oil but have never had big success. What about this news that Saudi and Russia may increase production ? Oil seems so at the mercy of headlines. Just short term noise ? Anyone ?
3000 2018-05-25 18:02:57 Took out money to fix my breaks finally and get a oil change and bum just come steal ya shit 
3001 2018-05-25 18:02:53 You should try with green tomatoes (the big ones) in stead of Cherry and put on them salt, olive oil, some vinegar and pepper  and origano.

3032 2018-05-25 17:59:53 so if a us company wanted to build a refinery you'd be against it or for it?   Canada still makes money from producing the oil and the support it gives the economy through jobs.  As well all those pension funds that invest in these corporations....
3033 2018-05-25 17:59:50 Yay! I love when we agree! but I believe in regulation which is usually fed to people as big govt. it’s big banks & big oil & the unlimited power they are given (from de-regulation) that takes power away from people and gives it to billionaires & faceless corps &  who buy policy

3041 2018-05-25 17:59:14 Just imagine if today Crude Oil was $140 - then figure out What we would be paying (if present Taxes remain)

3079 2018-05-25 17:55:03 "Now"?  I think that they always have. They are atheist.

And they are communist at heart. So yeah

3113 2018-05-25 17:50:54 @jiffylube what do you recommend to help clean oil stains off of concrete?  JL lube tech didn’t tighten up the filter on my last visit and now I have a nice puddle on my freshly pressure washed driveway.

3115 2018-05-25 17:50:14 Novak:
There’s no final decision on easing the supply cuts
Group not interested in overheating market, only cares for “fair” oil prices
Proportional easing for OPEC+ countries seems fair

3118 2018-05-25 17:49:45 A 20 litre jery-can of palm oil fell from my kitchen top to the tiled floor...
I jumped up from bed sweating..it was a nightmare 
If you know you know!
3119 2018-05-25 17:49:37 He got up to find out what the problem is lol. Meanwhile I've been here for like 2 hours. Walked in, no appointment, for an oil change and throttle body cleaning and can realize they are busy.
3120 2018-05-25 17:49:32 You mean the oil will be switched off?! Who knew? How do they do that? Or do you mean someone else gets the oil? Can you clarify please. I’m confused with that bit
3121 2018-05-25 17:49:26 Me: can I get a fucking oil change 
Nissan: sure sweetheart :)

3122 2018-05-25 17:49:11 Yes true that... let the specs unwind some, good opportunity to long Crude Oil for longer horizon trade on lower investment by oil companies, higher oil demand, increase in oil production by Russia and Saudi may take longer to agree on a target cut amt,  etc...
3123 2018-05-25 17:49:08 The state-owned oil company Petrobras adopted a pro-market policy of tracking international oil prices after President Michel Temer took office following the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff in 2016. That has seen prices almost double.

3128 2018-05-25 17:48:50 Really? You want people to quit bitching about raising gas prices? 
Silly man! 
True  they have been higher during other presidential administrations, however, trump brags and lies about oil prices among other things, it opens the doors to bitching. 

His words don’t = reality
3129 2018-05-25 17:48:20 Oh super cool and small world! Thought it was interesting that 'art' in this context was Banksy and not like an oil painting. I feel like that is usually the route things go when people bring 'the art of...' verbiage into marketing

3141 2018-05-25 17:46:42 Actually @elonmusk is fucking right. The media is owned by big oil, oh shit I'm sorry EVERYTHING is owned by big oil. So yes it makes sense that media outlets would overstate the issues of Tesla.

3147 2018-05-25 17:46:20 Oh yes it does it is called oil! High gas prices make Putin happy and Saudi Arabia happy! Isn’t Jared and don on their payroll now? Come on
3148 2018-05-25 17:46:19 Has ABU become so bad? @amen_oriakhi asked you a very simple question to make you realise the foolishness embedded in your tweet. Yet you couldn't see it. $58 was the international price of crude oil. Did all oil producing nations experience economic recession?
3149 2018-05-25 17:46:16 There is no oil producing country nearby.

I also wonder if they can rely on anyone.
3150 2018-05-25 17:46:13 This is not going to work. Haha looking for my vape oil haha

3165 2018-05-25 17:44:25 That's some spin. Oil price is hovering around 77 down from 110 in 2014......completely ignoring it was much lower now back up.......it is volatile every apart from the bonus sucking oil bosses knew that.
3166 2018-05-25 17:44:23 Your not concerned about oil prices I guess ?
3167 2018-05-25 17:44:06 heu tetep mahal wkwkwkw btw kl tea tree oil +fee +ongkir jd brp
3168 2018-05-25 17:44:05 $XLE 50ema test daily today - some context, during the bull run in oil 2012-2014 buys at 50ema were usually relative low. During sell-off from 2014-2016 50ema tests were usually relative highs. Important average for the trend here - currently rising, bullish bias as of now.
3169 2018-05-25 17:44:05 No salt?! I see potatoes and vegetable oil, but without the salt I can't combine them into fries!
3170 2018-05-25 17:43:52 Loot has happened with all govts - However last 4 years its been unprecedented - as its 4 times worse

Simple 
Just look at Stats of International Crude Oil Prices from 2009-2018 
And What we were being charged 

From a peak of $140 to $42 - Prices in Mumbai 

1/2
3171 2018-05-25 17:43:30 reminds me of Clinton's "nothing" statement on the Dakota Access Pipeline. "we need to respect the oil companies AND the tribes!"
3172 2018-05-25 17:43:27 Now seeing everybody predicting oil to hit 40$ - 25$ - 20$ 
Haha.. Predictions 
3173 2018-05-25 17:43:14 Good then you have no problem with him removing gun lobbyists, coal, oil, and other lobbyists that support processes proven by science to be harmful to the environment and human health, any lobbyist that tries to make their religious views into law, and all big business and banks
3174 2018-05-25 17:42:59 Do you growl at the fossil fuel industry everytime the price of oil climbs back up towards $100 a barrel or the price of gas spikes on a long weekend?

Why are job losses in Education just necessary transformational change, but not in energy?#skpoli
3175 2018-05-25 17:42:57 I can, but I don’t anymore. I gave up smoking a long time ago. When I started using #cannabis again for medical reasons, I tried smoking it, but I just couldn’t. Vaporizers and oil for me. 
3176 2018-05-25 17:42:48 question: would heat from a vagina deep fry a dick lubed with olive oil?
3177 2018-05-25 17:42:45 Western Select is at a price disadvantage both due to being a lower quality oil as well as the cost of transportation via railcar, to the tune of $20-$40/barrel. Once oil goes back to $150, and eventually to $400, none of that matters.
3178 2018-05-25 17:42:25 8% fiscal deficit and say oil revenues not to be used to close fiscal gap - insuffficient as they would be and anyway I thought 8% INCLUDED oil revenues - HOW will they fund extra spending over income ? How will they borrow it ? Do they estimate interest % on loans? 1
3179 2018-05-25 17:42:15 Could @senchuckschumer please explain how $70 #oilprice is Trump's fault yet never fault #Obama for $100+ oil prices for 4 years of his disastrous administration #Oil #energy #LiberalLogic #LiberalHypocrisy @foxnews @CNBC @CNN

3183 2018-05-25 17:41:44 He just needs to have a "long time" friend of the family give him the cannabis oil and everything will be fine.
3184 2018-05-25 17:41:34 Stagnant oil prices would greatly harm Iran and Russia, so it would be in Saudi Arabia's interest to to pull back from trying to raise oil prices. Do they want to finance more missiles being fired into Riyadh?

3218 2018-05-25 17:38:22 Ok. I get it. Strangling Iran’s oil market share clearly not enough. Crashing oil price with extra production will reduce the already low price of Iranian crude and speed up economic collapse. Interesting move let’s see what other OPEC members think of this.

3245 2018-05-25 17:36:09 For sure. I first thought it was Manny-ish and just an oil/water personality conflict with Cora, but I guess not. He’s gonna have no problem finding a new team. Not the Yankees though!

3248 2018-05-25 17:35:39 I was going to find food. I ended up cleaning up the fridge, the freezer, tidying up the kitchen cupboards. Throwing out all the things we don't need anymore. Discovered that I had 6 cans or sardine that had expired. One old bottle of olive oil. I still have not cooked.
3249 2018-05-25 17:35:35 we gon be honest about how coconut oil don’t do shit forreal? or we still lying ? 
3250 2018-05-25 17:35:33 I use medicated shampoo or African black soap and then I oil my scalp with castor oil. My scalp isn't even really dry by then but it flakes up.
3251 2018-05-25 17:35:26 just a few days ago the Saudi's said they wanted to see $80 oil.
now rumors are Saudi & Russia may increase production.
isn't this how they game the futures market to make a few billion?
some things never change.
3252 2018-05-25 17:35:22 of studies proving it works better and is healthier than prescription drugs. it’s used for people who don’t respond to prescription. people think the oil and regular weed are the same and that’s why people get fucked over

But, no worries, nothing ever goes wrong in oil production, stable as a rock...

3260 2018-05-25 17:34:29 cannabis oil has 98% of the thc removed and you get no high from it. it’s put like a drop on your gums or tongue to immediately hit your blood stream. so it still shows up in a pee test because of the 2% remaining. people are still skeptical about it. even tho there’s 1000s
3261 2018-05-25 17:34:21 Es que he has been slacking on that bread oil! 
3262 2018-05-25 17:34:15 Carrots Lightly braised in olive oil with lemon, garlic, & harissa are NOT yuck.
3263 2018-05-25 17:34:11 Been trying to find someone or somewhere to get hold of the oil
3264 2018-05-25 17:33:56 And renewables can grow with the demand for energy more cheaply and not damage the planet or cause climate change. At the same time, they provide far more jobs than oil and gas do. 
So why aren't we transitioning now again? 
(We can still use oil for a few select uses if nec.)
3265 2018-05-25 17:33:51 wowwwww siz wowwwwww.

3266 2018-05-25 17:33:40 Ok ok. How many of you #OOTTmoron s bought oil when SA/Russia had their stupid meeting over a month ago?

3279 2018-05-25 17:32:04 Oil rigs increase is purely a reaction to higher crude oil prices. That's all.

Even if the crude oil prices were to continue falling in the coming weeks, rigs count will continue to climb.

3280 2018-05-25 17:31:59 But if you really beileve that anyone thinks there will be 'no oil money' you're delusional. That is NOT what the report says and the oil and gas will not suddenly disappear.

3284 2018-05-25 17:31:36 Syria and Libya were not failed states before western interference. Secular countries with good economies just didn’t fit when wouldn’t allow oil price in dollar or a Qatari pipeline through it.
3285 2018-05-25 17:31:33 They're still struggling to accept the powers of cod liver oil.

If vegetables have 0 fat, how do they get vegetable oil from them? And if they have a miniscule amount, then just how many veggies does it take to make a bottle of oil?
3288 2018-05-25 17:31:03 US crude oil production has increased every single week thus far in 2018, except one. And that week, back in mid-February, output stayed flat. wow.

3290 2018-05-25 17:31:00 The government of Ghana has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Nicolas Cage in a rep wig.
3291 2018-05-25 17:30:59 BREAKING: Crude oil falls under $70 and Brent Crude below $78 as Russia and Saudi Arabia plan to increase oil output.
3292 2018-05-25 17:30:54 Oil prices are dropping today, in response to supply possibly rising, which is what drives oil prices. Presidents don't have much to do with it.
3293 2018-05-25 17:30:47 You’re gonna need to start bringing some baby oil to work 
3294 2018-05-25 17:30:42 Rashid khan after batting bowling taking catches fielding will drive the team to the hotel prepare food,tuck the players into bed, solve pollution issues, discover oil in India, reduce inflation, solve Syrian crisis,meet Kim Jon....
3295 2018-05-25 17:30:40 Your analysis of the  power n influence of oil has changed my perspective of international politics .
3296 2018-05-25 17:30:26 Ironic when she says "a direction that everyone accepts will make the country poorer" - No North sea oil revenue. no jobs created by Trident, no pound & no income from the central UK government - Surely we can all accept that so-called 'independence' will make Scotland poorer
3297 2018-05-25 17:30:23 data is new oil. So modi ensured dara cheaper and  oil costlier.
who wants other ways?
3298 2018-05-25 17:30:23 In the past 2 weeks I’ve gotten a shoe rack, a cube shelf organizer, and an essential oil diffuser for my room & I’ve never been so happy. Wow what an adult

3300 2018-05-25 17:30:20 I’m going on two with no heat. Conditioning every other day, a deep conditioner as leave in, and organic oil has saved my hair. They’re springy instead of flat now
3301 2018-05-25 17:29:58 Thanks.   Yes, net short commercial oil position has been reduced, but, and here is where the gross positions come in, not because shorts are covering, but because net longs are being established.  In my work, it is important to distinguish short covering from outright buying.
3302 2018-05-25 17:29:51 First I read some crazy stuff about prostitutes with some of the squeakiest-clean GOP's (tho not Mitch), and THEN I read about Russian oil & hedge-funds & money-laundering, & I can't trust a one-of'-em.  #ex-GOP
3303 2018-05-25 17:29:44 I was always amazed how Boone was making money in the market and finding oil in the publicly traded companies when the DJIA was at 1,000! Happy Birthday to a true legend.  #boone90
3304 2018-05-25 17:29:39 Ayy nice  haha yea the urges to smoke I’m sure will come and go and getting rid of that habit will come in waves, but edible oil is a cleaner high and it’s better without a sugar-filled sweet weighing me down lol
3305 2018-05-25 17:29:35 They probably do, but I didn’t have one in England either. I use oil so rarely that it’s not worth storing a fryer or filling it with oil. I’ll definitely try it in a pan one day. Mmm. Bhajis.
3306 2018-05-25 17:29:34 For everyone whose trying to find alternatives for eco styler gel try

You will not be disappointed
3307 2018-05-25 17:29:28 Oil prices way down today! Hopefully gas priced will follow, but don't count on it.
3308 2018-05-25 17:29:18 I don’t even know how to drive but I just got an application from someone at Oil Changer’s bc that looks like such a cool trade to learn. Probably would help me get over my driving anxiety lol

3312 2018-05-25 17:28:31 $30 netback is conservative. Brent above US$75, 1750bbl/day, and flat operating costs - means $40 netback in q2. Goes even higher when #txp has 2,000bbl/ day! #stocks #Oil #oilandgas

3319 2018-05-25 17:27:45 Because
1) Chavez did good for the poor but he only papered over cracks
2) he left country too dependent on oil 
3) Venezuela pegs it’s currency to US $
4) US constantly screws with the country
3320 2018-05-25 17:27:44 Pre save available for new @sakimamusic  my gay ass is on that shit ready set lock someone grab the gun oil
3321 2018-05-25 17:27:43 3) they want us to buy oil from terrorist nations and sail it over our pristine and fragile seas instead of producing it ourselves and sending it through pipelines, which if there was a spill would be easier and safer to clean up.
3322 2018-05-25 17:27:38 Could be.  If so it's dumb.  I can't imagine the makers of fish oil pills derive competitive advantage from me being able to open their bottle easier than the vitamin people.
3323 2018-05-25 17:27:29 it's absurd! If those corporations wanted to even maintain their control of the energy industry they could be the ones to revolutionize it and move away from oil but somehow the short term wealth they experience outweighs being acknowledged for preventing the planet from melting
3324 2018-05-25 17:27:29 First week of full time oil and gas finished n now I am getting a cold 
3325 2018-05-25 17:27:25 @Route13autoinc claim they stand behind what they sell. Just bought a Ford F250. Needed two major repairs within the first 45 days: 4 fuel injectors ($2k) and oil pump ($3k).  They won’t reimburse me for the repairs or let me swap it out for another truck.  Buyer Beware.

3335 2018-05-25 17:26:50 India only has reserve for 10 days of full consumption and could last a month by rationing. We would have to turn our economy into a war economy and invade an oil producing country, if embargo lasts longer. Some marginal oil wells would also be developed for military consumption.
3336 2018-05-25 17:26:47 Yeah, they're serious about it so long as combating it does not regulate business, industry, consumers, or have a negative effect on the profits of the oil and gas industry.
3337 2018-05-25 17:26:47 #A12 temporary closure J27 > J28 was due to a broken down vehicle carrying two children and a disabled passenger. If this happens to you then;

1. Get out of the vehicle to a safe place. 
2. Dial 999 and request help. 

Always check your oil & water before long journeys.
3338 2018-05-25 17:26:46 If controlling oil prices at retail level was a massive growth strategy, Venezuela would have been the fastest growing economy in the world, and not bankrupt at the moment.

3374 2018-05-26 23:58:03 Meanwhile libs have done nothing for eight years about the billions in profits going on for years because oil companies control the amounts of oil refined in the US to keep prices up and when there is any world disaster or global economy change they cut production and increase—
3375 2018-05-26 23:57:58 Seriously, how do you look at a situation like this and, rather than being comforted that a child has been relieved of suffering, think “Cannabis oil? THAT’S THE DEVIL WEED!”

3380 2018-05-26 23:56:09 @RonWyden you stupid fool...actually Crude Oil Futures have fallen almost 10% since his announcement on Iran..but will you allow for any drilling in Oregon? No. Will you allow for a new refinery to be built? No...Now explain why gas is a $1.00 cheaper in Texas?
3381 2018-05-26 23:56:06 if your skin is perfect and you tell me to use OIL the door is right there

3386 2018-05-26 23:55:22 Oil and gas/mineral exploration in a democratic, free market society like Canada is funded by investors who seek a reasonable return on investment. This is at a very nominal cost to consumers b/c the company takes the risk and relies on expert advice. O+G margins small vs risk.

3390 2018-05-26 23:55:05 Until the fracking wildcatters screw up Big Oil's plotting again.  And that's why US energy independence is so important.  Let the rest of the world trade in oil. If we have ours, we can export some at THEIR price, and sell domestic with our own market price. Not fungible.

3408 2018-05-26 23:51:54 You’re thinking too small if you’re talking abt power plants. Calculate in ALL the resources it takes just to secure the oil supply to even build the power plants themselves. It’s not breaking even with that massive investment.

3472 2018-05-26 23:42:11 So we don't import Iranian oil, we produce more than we use.
Our imports come from other countries...  Iranians are trying to produce more. Explain how that works?  It more than likely has to do with refining and Holiday weekend demand.

3477 2018-05-26 23:40:59 The price of gas goes up every summer. Refineries shut down to change over in order to treat the gas & oil according to law. The price goes down in the winter.
3478 2018-05-26 23:40:59 Get a clue Ron, Trump is not responsible for everything bad that happens in world, look 2 OPEC as true culprits here, they R doing exactly what they did in 70's by withholding oil in hope of causing shortage & driving up price, USA needs 2 respond by pumping more oil into system
3479 2018-05-26 23:40:55 I truly believe that was his intention.  
1. Israel was chopping at the bit to go to war with Iran
2.  Trump wanted oil/gas prices to go up.  
Question is, how does he benefit from the price of gas rising?  Not just him, but was this payback for UAE/Russian help with election

3497 2018-05-26 23:38:54 HOW IS OIL A FUCK SUBSTANCE
3498 2018-05-26 23:38:41 Wrong. It's the global demand along with OPEC cutting production. And if you knew anything they announced they were going to increase production. Oil prices dropped the last 2 days. Love that Iran deal don't you @RonWyden DISINGENUOUS MUCH?

3502 2018-05-26 23:37:57 No, Phase 7 of the project is the twinning of the line to the Westridge Marine Terminal for the sole purpose of loading 7X’s more oil tankers for the purpose of selling oil to Asia in addition to the few boats currently sailing to California refineries with cokers.
3503 2018-05-26 23:37:37 No big deal. It will just open up more possibilities for American oil production and jobs. I do not think liberals understand these things

3505 2018-05-26 23:37:26 When you store it do you store it for the winter with face down or on its side cuz what happens during the winter all your oil and refrigerant just sit and you got to turn it on and let it cycle for a little bit blowing cold air if not get a charging kit at Walmart

3508 2018-05-26 23:37:05 My face is an oil mine. Tmi, but I needed you to know that.
3509 2018-05-26 23:36:53 Someone said it was great defending. 
3510 2018-05-26 23:36:50 I hear ya... I served in the late 80s. I signed up to protect the country. I feel anyone that does to some extent the same. Now obviously we don't and didn't have control of the mission.  Gulf war 1 & 2 were about oil so to that I also agree.
3511 2018-05-26 23:36:46 @Ahmadlalar HBD lala oil money age wif grace.. sory late post.. Afuwa.
3512 2018-05-26 23:36:44 im at an italian restaurant and the hand soap in the bathroom is made of olive oil. i love my people
3513 2018-05-26 23:36:41 aite. I got almond milk, coconut oil, GF flour, coconut sugar,dark chocolate and aquafaba... let me get my vegan chocolate cake going so I can have a slice(or all) with my cup of tea later
3514 2018-05-26 23:36:37 Hotels are where people fuck and Oil is a fuck substance
3515 2018-05-26 23:36:30 The price for oil just dropped 2.83 and you have no earthly idea on what drives or controls oil prices that end up at the gas pump.
3516 2018-05-26 23:36:17 Same place as rest of the hundreds of thousands of other asylum seekers that just NVR showed up for court and we don't know where they are
3517 2018-05-26 23:36:11 It's that coconut oil baby it's that coconut oil
3518 2018-05-26 23:36:06 Had an absolute blast with the ladies from Prevailing Love at the I Still Have Oil conference!! Ya'll kept me in stitches laughing and your love and support was PRICELESS!! Love you!!

3520 2018-05-26 23:35:56 I'd go further. It's not just wrong. It's directly murderous. By destroying the exchange rate, goods become unobtainable by regular citizens, it's a death by  thousand pins. My aunts, who teach, report kids suffering malnutrition. That hasn't happened in #Libya since hitting oil
3521 2018-05-26 23:35:53 Spent 80 on a oil change,

3523 2018-05-26 23:35:43 I'm proud of myself for finishing my skinpeeler, hair oil & body foam all at once! Hope I can work through everything before I get new ones x'D
3524 2018-05-26 23:35:27 I feel ya! Luckily, I have a mechanic in the family, but it is not always convenient and the oil was overdue. But that made the old saying, how ever sad, to never trust a mechanic true in my eyes. I know there are good ones out there, but there are franchises built on dishonesty.
3525 2018-05-26 23:35:22 at current world oil prices American frackers will drill more, driving the price of gasoline back down.  We control the world energy market-not Iran, not the Saudis.
3526 2018-05-26 23:35:03 War Oil- "Why don't damned oil companies fly their own flags on their property- maybe a flag with a gas pump on it" - Marine General Smedley Butler 1937
3527 2018-05-26 23:35:01 Are you referring to the Marathassa spill? I am pretty sure that was not diluted bitumen. Pretty sure it was fuel oil.
3528 2018-05-26 23:35:01 ill still make fun of Boob cuz its Boob at least oil and hotel arent called Tit or Breast
3529 2018-05-26 23:34:36 “Oh calm down. The dude masturbates with coconut oil.”

“That means he probably has a smooth dick!”

3530 2018-05-26 23:34:17 There's no such thing as ethical oil.
3531 2018-05-26 23:34:15 Oil prices should be higher to fund infrastructure and make the US energy dependent. That, however, is strategic thinking Trump is incapable of.

3533 2018-05-26 23:33:37 I am taller than KAI... I guess that peaches helps you grow better than curry and chili oil...
3534 2018-05-26 23:33:09 U saying he is talking about price of petrol and not crude oil in itself is disappointing to know. (The prices depend on the price of crude oil) petrol is made from that
3535 2018-05-26 23:33:05 You know I really cant make fun of Jasper naming his oc Oil or kittydog naming their oc Boob because for the longest time one of my oc's names was Hotel
3536 2018-05-26 23:32:29 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

3538 2018-05-26 23:32:23 The bad balloon's unnatural surface gave me delusion that let me speculate it as oil painting! In the meaning, the balloon is well-made...
And you are aesthetically talented. I speculated that the living space was some sort of artwork!
3539 2018-05-26 23:32:22 Give everyone free college and a stipend for living expenses. Create more public parks. Make all animal shelters no kill. Ban unsustainable palm oil. Create more green energy. Ban nitrates. Make housing a right. Open the borders, end ICE. Disarm the police.
3540 2018-05-26 23:32:20 No, there are no roads to Asia and there on no train tracks to Asia. There’s only one way with 650 000 barrels of a toxic and flammable substance!

Listen to what Trudeau himself had been saying this week, it’s about getting oil to the coast and to international markets.
3541 2018-05-26 23:32:10 Smh I like to treat myself and cook my veg with olive oil, salt, and pepper (the holy trinity) I’m not about to sit and eat this kindergarten project that you call coleslaw

3544 2018-05-26 23:31:56 It’s bitumen which is a solid. We’re not refining it in BC. into oil. To go through the pipeline bitumen is mixed with condensate which makes a toxic, highly flammable sludge (diluted bitumen). When dilbit spills in water it cannot be cleaned up. #StopKM
3545 2018-05-26 23:31:51 Israel. A situation calculated a century past, at the expense of even the Jews, to give the occidental powers a foothold and a perpetual canker in the Arab lands.  Without this there may have been an Arabian Union and industrial/intellectual developed from the oil money power.
3546 2018-05-26 23:31:40 That’s absurd .. we have access to plenty of oil
3547 2018-05-26 23:31:38 Every time i try to find the argon oil one it is always gone from the shelves

3549 2018-05-26 23:31:05 Yes, it most certainly is ... call me a superstitious  . but in the details I see Vlad maneuvering from the world's largest oil and gas reserves.
3550 2018-05-26 23:31:01 Oil prices boosted by news China, U. Germany taps its past as her own, which is shut in both directions.
3551 2018-05-26 23:30:50 I'm not a tree huggeror an environmentalist but I don't get how it benefits us to let oil flow through our country to refine and sell overseas. We buy oil from the mid east. Only oil companies and special interest prosper. Don't ruin our land for their (including) our government.
3552 2018-05-26 23:30:40 Looks good but could do with some weathering, Crack out those oil paints boi!
3553 2018-05-26 23:30:37 Rosehip oil is amazing and the red one that’s like aHa bh or something
3554 2018-05-26 23:30:25 Properly inflated tires, fresh
 oil, and a clean air filter also helps. You wanna do this bro?

3557 2018-05-26 23:30:02 Have u seen how much is in the Legacy Fund? Have u noticed how much your taxes went down when oil was up?

3564 2018-05-26 23:29:03 If you were leading us you would you authorize all 3 pipelines projects to start building and flowing no matter provincial oppasission executive order putting 800000 Canadians to work oil sands and fracking at full capacity. ??????
3565 2018-05-26 23:28:51 everyone go make this salad!

MIX + ENJOY !

MAYBE EAT IT ALL !
3566 2018-05-26 23:28:02 America needs to pump more oil from our country and keep prices down we have more oil in this country than the arab nations
3567 2018-05-26 23:27:49 Because we export the oil we drill in America so rather than being able to set the price the refineries in Saudi Arabia and other countries we import from set the prices.
3568 2018-05-26 23:27:25 U didn't get my point. 
The price of crude oil (raw material) for petroleum is what affects the price of petrol mainly. And this govt. Hasn't decreased the price of petrol when the prices collapsed and now they are charging more when the prices are going up.(check the picture)
3569 2018-05-26 23:27:24 Damn you I'm checking my oil changed 
3570 2018-05-26 23:27:24 Just research the oil found then the wells capped to control the inventory... demand high supply low....$$$$$$

3573 2018-05-26 23:27:13 I haven’t experienced it yet , i know i stopped using the olive oil one on my edges cause it would flake pretty bad.
3574 2018-05-26 23:27:12 Gasoline and oil prices have been going up since the first of the year. No tax break refund, that's for sure. They are not even making excuses like changing to summer blend......oh sure.....so that's what makes it more expensive?? Different ingredients for different blends???
3575 2018-05-26 23:27:10 aha hot oil just went into my eye
3576 2018-05-26 23:26:33 dont drink oil

Then adding more Wrong to that....He is a oil slick of a dumpster fire in the Drinking water of America.

3580 2018-05-26 23:25:57 Your analysis of crude oil has been spot on. Where did you receive training? Any recommended reading?

3588 2018-05-26 23:23:29 Vandervere goes up in smoke coming off his 2nd qualifying lap. Oil all down the back stretch.
3589 2018-05-26 23:23:16 Don't talk to me about "the free market" when oil and gas companies are dependent on the government to artificially prop them up while suppressing solar and wind power. This is NOT a free market when gov't penalizes sustainable energy. @PSCWisconsin @AmerTransCo @MGEMadison
3590 2018-05-26 23:22:52 I’m cute af but lemme apologize for the rude comments. Coming for people’s appearances is out of character for me & it’s honestly embarrassing. Castor oil helps with hair growth and at least your lips aren’t paper thin 
3591 2018-05-26 23:22:47 The best part is , his profile picture is him sitting In a car probably running . And the oil that was use to make the camera to take the picture. Far left are so hypocritical

3608 2018-05-26 23:18:34 19.5% stake in Russian Oil Company Roseneft, is that the kind of BRIBERY Republicans will allow?  This President bought and paid for by Putin.  How much money is Trump making off the Gas Price increases?

3609 2018-05-26 23:18:30 I agree completely. Decades ago, I had a fam member working for oil companies, & he showed them myriad ways to shift to renewables that would also benefit them financially in the long term. But all they cared ab was the $ in the short-term. Same way they think ab the environment.

3616 2018-05-26 23:16:50 Why are all govts sympathetic to Muslims ? Is it because of vote bank? Or is it because of Oil from middle east? Or is it because of the money they receive from middle east? Why is it alright for Muslims to abuse other religions& carry out attacks while vice versa is no allowed?

3638 2018-05-26 23:13:30 If you're trying to do a slick look do it when you hair is wet. Put moisture in it, then oil, then the Eco Styler Gel or Got To Be Glue Hair Gel. Then slick it back section by section. Then you can let it air dry or tie it down with a silk/satin scarf or the paper hair strips.

3644 2018-05-26 23:13:07 The #TMX is about selling oil to Asia for us all to get more $ and adding capacity for oil hungry Metro Vancouver. The #TMX pipeline twinning is about adding to something that's already there, with trying to keep more tankers off the rails for other commodities. Huge Difference!!
3645 2018-05-26 23:13:03 1) Go to a craft shop and buy a few pints of liquid glass/sodium silicate. Use cash.
2) Dilute to mixture w/60 percent tap water.
3) Wait until 3 a.m.
4) Drain his oil.
5) Replace with solution.

3691 2018-05-26 23:05:52 When the vine breaks there is an oil that comes out. Found out I’m allergic to that oil when I removed a vine. Fun times
3692 2018-05-26 23:05:50 We have oil...
3693 2018-05-26 23:05:38 Well said - plus, if it wasn't for all the oil we're buying from the middle east, filling saudi pockets with our cash.... instead of being such a positive influence on humanity these last 20 years, the islamic world would be funding terrorism and war around the globe.
3694 2018-05-26 23:05:36 Trophy winning, oil money wankers to you 
3695 2018-05-26 23:05:34 Yep - the point I was trying to make is - ignoring offshore oil income say UK went into a 4% surplus, Sco would be at a 3% deficit. So according to this report, great move forward as an independent country etc as 3% is sustainable. However Sco is still waving goodbye to £10bn pa
3696 2018-05-26 23:05:26 A good one requires good ingredients, a nice sharp cheddar, interesting bread, and some zingy seasoning and a nice mix of just a little olive oil and butter to grill it in,,,and then you're set!
3697 2018-05-26 23:05:18 3 options: Ackee and saltfish and use coconut oil so it pops, mini rock cake with Tastee cheese squares, banana or saltfish fritters. If you go for the sweet option dust some powdered sugar on

This morning I bought @schm7dt's ECCC course while enjoying some black coffee w/ CBD oil. I’ve spent the last few hours reading it and absorbing its diamonds.  It got me thinking...
3701 2018-05-26 23:05:06 Hour 9 on a tractor
I have become one with the seat my blood has been replaced with hydrolic oil and I have heard every classic rock song known to man
3702 2018-05-26 23:04:49 It is all cause #EU  supports #Iran  deal, while #USA #Israel and #SaudiArabia want war with Iran...Its simple....Those will now put pressure to EU countries to change their mind. I suppose i will from today just use my bicycle and boycot oil from bloody saudis
3703 2018-05-26 23:04:45 Venezuela’s elections were apparently faultless. Beyond suspicion and checkable. Only the overwhelming support for Maduro gives cause for concern to those with ambitions to privatise Venezuelan oil and overthrow the elected government.
3704 2018-05-26 23:04:45 I am sure something involving oil
3705 2018-05-26 23:04:36 Stop buying oil from Venezuela!!! @POTUS

3710 2018-05-26 23:03:43 you probably just need to add some oil then but I would check your oil level first
3711 2018-05-26 23:03:37 Think iamma try bio oil,  everybody been raving about it

3718 2018-05-26 23:02:22 You ppl are charging the people of Khi the unit price which has been calculated incorporating the furnace oil prices but just to increase your margins you are not using furnace in your actual production. Abb kisi ku pagal banany se pehllay yaad rakhna ramzan chal raha hai.

3736 2018-05-26 23:00:18 Remittances from USA is Mexico's Top income source, over and above their crude oil production.  

Let that sink in.
3737 2018-05-26 23:00:17 3 subs per year?! I object, too, for other reasons: sonar is disrupting cetaceans. Plus, I've no confidence that oil sludge + trash + bilge are not dumped--after all, who's to witness?
3738 2018-05-26 22:59:43 In all honesty it smells like burnt hair, argan oil & baby lotion in here. It’s fine.
3739 2018-05-26 22:59:33 when sophie releases OIL OF EVERY PEARL’S UN-INSIDES it will be over for y’all
3740 2018-05-26 22:59:30 Whoever is the twitter handler of this bullshit company let me enlighten you. You ppl are under utilizing your plants because furnace oil prices have gone up and you are not using it because it increases the cost of production. Resulting in low production and hence loadshedding
3741 2018-05-26 22:59:30 Have we learned our lesson yet??? Forget the oil industry, cut off all subsidies.
Invest that money in something with a future and stability.
3742 2018-05-26 22:59:22 Nobody got a weed oil plug 
3743 2018-05-26 22:59:15 it might just be that you need to add oil, when was the last time you got an oil change?

3745 2018-05-26 22:59:14 Recipes? I don't need no stinkin recipes. Improvise, baby.
Salt 
Pepper
Corriander
Garlic
Onion
Parsley
Oregano
and just a pinch or three of Tandoori seasoning.
And don't forget; if your frying chicken, use coconut oil.
3746 2018-05-26 22:59:13 You just have to oil your hands up and take your time taking them out you should be good
3747 2018-05-26 22:58:55 Coconut oil is suuuuper great, I put it in my beard when it gets long enough
3748 2018-05-26 22:58:49 So I’ve been using bio oil for my scars and face , Along with essentia water and it’s literally the best combo ever. My skin has improved so much 
3749 2018-05-26 22:58:44 Actually, a progressive canada is not in the oil business.
3750 2018-05-26 22:58:13 Vaguely like asparagus. I blanch them and then roast them in the frying pan with olive oil like asparagus. Washing and blanching removes any trace of a gold papery covering the very newly sprouted ones have. They have a mild flavor.
3751 2018-05-26 22:57:55 @nsgov someone needs to use the interrupter clause and drop the gas price at the pumps. Oil prices took a big drop. Come on step up NS.

3755 2018-05-26 22:57:31 Think about it, that fact that you created this tweet using a device that is comprised of using byproducts of oil and natural gas. And fossil fuels were used to mine for the many compounds that make up the batteries and circuitry.. great tweet though..
3756 2018-05-26 22:56:38 Every school should teach this!  Respect, consideration and common civility is the oil that lubes the machinery of our culture.   Bravo to this teacher!

3759 2018-05-26 22:56:03  always being available doesn’t means it’s the best option, hence my previous message about oil being energy dense. Look up specific energy.

3774 2018-05-26 22:52:13 For almost a year now, the Canadian dollar has been unstable, although the economic situation is excellent and there is no correlation between the strength of the dollar and the depreciation of oil. I do not know about the role of the Central Bank in this matter

3779 2018-05-26 22:51:19 I agree the challenges will be something breathable and still a barrier protection for oil and fluids. For short use like procedures standards like SMS and other nonwoven material works. However oculus go probably doesnt run as hot as GEAR VR.

3783 2018-05-26 22:50:37 I woke up feeling alright

Felt attacked when I woke up
Then decided to fight back

I listened to some music
Took meds & drank tea
Did yoga
Bought the first copy of Wolverine
Took cbd oil
Ate some fresh mint
Am gonna get stoned
As shit
3784 2018-05-26 22:50:30 I actually didn't insult you at all.  You were sharing the same articles repeatedly. I simply indicated that (yes, I'm aware she is diversified) still an over reliance on one specific resource.  Am I incorrect? Are we at the point where if oil disappeared we'd be ok?
3785 2018-05-26 22:50:18 Umm...
Sushi has fish.
Fish is oily.
Oil will coat and soothe your throat.

You’re welcome.

3790 2018-05-26 22:49:53 He pulled out of the Iran deal, which caused a lot of upset and fear of sanctions on imports on something like oil. And for the record, the price per barrel reach $70 earlier this month, which is the highest it’s been in almost 4 years. (2/2)

3793 2018-05-26 22:49:22 "Electric vehicles were supposed to be the car of the future because we were running out of oil — until we weren’t." You are clearly so short sighted. Don't ever cover technology and environmental issues ever again. You just don't get ti.

3799 2018-05-26 22:48:11 thanks Nez, not the end of the world, a risk i take, but shitty still. trying to keep it at bay with tea tree/lavendar oil topically and that stops the buzzing burning sensation for awhile, hoping nothing will break out. appreciate the response. ty <3

3802 2018-05-26 22:47:16 I am afraid it is those who believe GSM/Ice Age scam who have fallen for liars and bought their snake oil. AGW is real! CO2 and H2O ARE blocking a lot of thermal IR, sending it back down warming the surface and lower atmosphere. Arctic Amplification of AGW is causing wild weather
3803 2018-05-26 22:47:05 You can't arrest one criminal, just be another one. The idiotic ramblings of leftists. If we believed them, why do anything can't stop it

Weird thing to say, but it was honestly better than any of the other places I’ve been to.
3810 2018-05-26 22:45:50 Is it oil free?
3811 2018-05-26 22:45:31 Aren’t we so luckybeen in the UK for 2 weeks searching for Olive oil
3812 2018-05-26 22:45:30 Not sure if you're finna make it at home, but if you do gotta make it the Michigan way. Flour, salt and pepper pan fried in oil. Damn delicious.

3814 2018-05-26 22:45:13 Yes inflationary. Time frame is important. Gotta shake out oil longs. I’m just going to Long oil at 65 and do tech options. Gotta play where it matters. Crazy it feels like no one knows, but world needs oil, and US is toooo far ahead monetarily . So much potential for asset appr

3817 2018-05-26 22:45:06 UPDATE: you Harvest it's fat. your lamp is running low on oil.
3818 2018-05-26 22:45:06 You are right. Soros is a lead shareholder of Netflix now  (and Google) they put Susan Rice on the board, and now the "low road" obamas are pushing their snake oil.
3819 2018-05-26 22:44:49 I’ll be the third! It’s kind of a weird feeling at first because it turns into an oil but it will take off every drop of makeup
3820 2018-05-26 22:44:49 Higher oil prices are not good for ND.
3821 2018-05-26 22:44:41 Karl you are from the middle east and you play drug-craft. Honestly you should've been founder when i got it nerd. Nice guy! And recommend for iraqs leader in oil
3822 2018-05-26 22:44:31 Renewable is he future and we are well placed as anywhere outside of the places with huge solar farm potential.  But it won’t make us money like oil would have. It currently provides little energy on grand scheme, nuclear is vital to fill void as fossil fuel use rightly declines.

No thank you by @WhiteHouse for @SenBobCorker 
No thank you by @WhiteHouse for cooperation of newly elected Pres Maduro, Venezuela.
Only PR positioning. 
Venezuela can be self sufficient w oil exports. Stop picking on small countries like Cuba & NK

3833 2018-05-26 22:42:53 If Obama was POTUS we wouldn’t have three dollars plus a gallon gas prices. Russia benefits, Geez Venezuela released a prisoner. Brazil, Russia, Venezuela and many other countries not friendly to democracy will benefit from Trump’s policies. Follow the oil! Trump, “Take the oil.”
3834 2018-05-26 22:42:50 A proposed pipeline in B.C. will carry fuel from the US and Asia to the Vancouver airport brought to Vancouver on ships. Huh? I guess that’s safer and more environmentally friendly than Canadian oil going the opposite direction??? #TransMountain

3837 2018-05-26 22:42:18 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.
Psalms 23:5-6 KJV
3838 2018-05-26 22:42:12 No it didn’t. We spent it on other things. But saying ‘being in the UK means we make little from oil’ is a non sequitur. Indy doesn’t change it. We can’t make serious money from oil no matter what we do now. Thats my point. The union benefits Scotland now.
3839 2018-05-26 22:42:05 Bio oil? Gak tau juga sih
3840 2018-05-26 22:42:04 the things ive gotten in my eye today: spicy ramen broth, coconut oil, foundation, and onions
3841 2018-05-26 22:41:50 I am not disagreeing that that person's point is shitty. Mostly upset about the fact the US is the world's largest oil consumer and man, we aren't doing shit for the prices.
3842 2018-05-26 22:41:43 I season the chicken, add chopped rosemary and just toss with a little oil and balsamic then grill it

3853 2018-05-26 22:39:42 Let’s see every important stock is set up in a cup and handle, real rates are going down, Fed is back talking rate increases, and earnings are coming in hot as ever... take advantage of this run up as oil goes down and infl goes down - last chance for goldilox.

3856 2018-05-26 22:39:31 So @POTUS @realDonaldTrump not only has gotten the 2 Korea's together, but has been arranging more political hostages to be brought back to their families. The man impresses me more & more every day, now if the man can work on bringing gas prices back down by drilling for our oil
3857 2018-05-26 22:39:30 Let's consider steep fall in crude prices from $145 to $80, is a fate of poor citizens because money charged additionally on oil is going in poor ppl schemes & infra. So win win for all. Why worry so much?

3874 2018-05-26 22:36:58 And, I imagine, not totally guaranteed free of hemp oil.
3875 2018-05-26 22:36:51 Re Nuts, they tried to kill all birds with one stone i. solve the post-War shortage of veg. oil ii. encourage Tzians to live on plantations etc. iii. replace income from the textile market lost to the Japanese with a monopoly of veg. oil. If only there had been more Tz input.
3876 2018-05-26 22:36:29 Yes yes, happened industrial revolution,p roduction line manufacturing, computers in workplace, etc etc. Humans have a gene that thinks a disaster is coming. I can think of a few more, climate change , millennium bug, peak oil, ozone hole, Labor Govt

3881 2018-05-26 22:35:44 Car clean 
Oil checked 
Levels checked 
Petrol 
Tires pumped 

Guess I'm ready to drive to Slam Dunk 
3882 2018-05-26 22:35:34 saturated in olive oil
3883 2018-05-26 22:35:23 oo i remember that, that was hella scary LOL. i went in for an oil change and pepboys kept me for 2 hours, lied about nails in my tires that were irreparable because there was “0 pressure and internal damages” to the tire, and wanted me to drop a total of $370
3884 2018-05-26 22:35:17 I know, they warned the market. It is healthy, shake out the last minute speculators who jumped on the band wagon. I think oil consolidates here and goes back up eventually. The market will price in the million BPD add and then maybe just hang out for a bit.
3885 2018-05-26 22:35:02 Is this referring to the oil change you got today
3886 2018-05-26 22:34:51 No, adding more staff does not cut down on the number of entry points. I feel like there's some sorry of major misconception or misunderstanding happening here. Drugs come here via cars and trucks. More staff has literally zero affect on that.
3887 2018-05-26 22:34:40 Klopp should buy himself a jar of anointing oil to break this curse of losing cup finals.
3888 2018-05-26 22:34:31 Coconut oil does wonders for my waves!!!!
3889 2018-05-26 22:34:22 All that college knowledge and they didnt teach you that our renewable resource is and always was  available. 
Oil takes 82% of work to yield 18% benefit. So roughly spend $400b to  pay military for inefficient energy. Thats the best oil can do for the next hundred years? Sad
3890 2018-05-26 22:34:21 It is messed up for a team to come in and win it in their 1st yr when so many franchises have never got a sniff.
3891 2018-05-26 22:34:16 aaaand I’m officially switching from tanning oil to sunscreen
3892 2018-05-26 22:34:09 @POTUS please allow canabis oil to be used medically and not get in the way of kids playing sports in college! Seems upside down to ban these athletes from college sports but we still allow semiautomatic weapons everywhere.
3893 2018-05-26 22:33:55 Scotland has only 8.3% of the UK’s population.
But we do have:

32% of the total land area
61% of the total sea area
90% of all fresh water
65% of all natural gas production
96.5% of all crude oil production
81% of all untapped coal reserves
62% of all timber product

1/4
3894 2018-05-26 22:33:43 And the support the oil sands received from the federal government when the price of oil was too low for the state of extraction technology at the time.
3895 2018-05-26 22:33:27 I’m saying, we don’t sign the “best” player in any position.  We sign players we think we can turn into the best.  We don’t have oil money.  That’s what I mean.

3898 2018-05-26 22:32:39 You’re right. I shouldn’t comment about the price of gas. I know nothing about it and never buy it. Just enjoying my EV as you all try to justify this insanity of oil prices. Classic Stockholm syndrome, seems you like to pay for gas. ;-)
3899 2018-05-26 22:32:37 Bye bye
3900 2018-05-26 22:32:32 They're roasted sweet peppers curated in oil and a pinch of sugar, they're exquisite IMO, pretty common in Spain
3901 2018-05-26 22:32:22 I feel so adult-ish making oil change appointments and making doctors/ grooming appointments for my son. Wow.
3902 2018-05-26 22:32:11 About to make this canna oil for my brownies and steak for tomorrow. Pretty stoked about it.

3904 2018-05-26 22:31:47 Hell no!! Get a steak, olive oil, few pieces of smashed garlic, and tear up some rosemary. Put it in all in a plastic bag and let it sit for a few hours. Take the steaks out of the plastic bag, and put salt & pepper on both sides. Put it on the grill until rare/medium rare.
3905 2018-05-26 22:31:40 And you have no idea whats going on in the Oil Industry, why the prices are going, will continue to go up. Nothing to do with DJT/Obama. Educate yourself before you spew you’re BS on .
3906 2018-05-26 22:31:38 Oya... Maza this is 18+ talk be going home
3907 2018-05-26 22:31:32 Kale salad, sliced almonds, avocado, olive oil, ceasar dressing, cherry tomatoes and baked chicken..... No joke, its so good!!!!
3908 2018-05-26 22:31:26 Such a BS! Just travelled through US, went to Barbados and... there's plastic garbage bags collected by house keeping every single day! No recycling, no composting in many US states!!! And... we in Canada are producing "dirty" oil. Go to hell and get a life :(

3913 2018-05-26 22:30:45 @TuckerCarlson 
Hey Tucker
Gas prices ALWAYS go up in Spring & Summer.   It's a scam the gas providers use every year saying they have to make a 'summer blend" which supposedly costs them more.   OIL PRICES have actually gone down recently.   No direct tie to pump prices.

3921 2018-05-26 22:29:26 How about a follow up article on the long term costs of @Alberta_UCP oil or nothing policies.
3922 2018-05-26 22:29:19 So walked into our family’s go to mechanic shop yesterday for a standard oil change... walked out with an oil change, new brakes and rotors, new air filters and something else I can’t remember... dropped $400 on the spot. This is #adulting.  
3923 2018-05-26 22:28:59 then she like holds you down and smothers an oil all over you

3925 2018-05-26 22:28:33 Don’t look at me. But that was the argument of the oil companies. However they seemed such convenient targets.
3926 2018-05-26 22:28:28 I was cooking food and oil jumped into my eye  adulting is cancelled

3929 2018-05-26 22:28:14 People can police themselves. I gave up meat/dairy/oil/alcohol 1.5 years ago. Realistically speaking, the animal agriculture industry will keep the food police away, lol. I did the research and would like to not die of heart disease or cancer. Of course, nothing is certain.

3931 2018-05-26 22:27:46 What happened to the oil discovered via fracking that was suppose to dwarf the oil fields in Texas back in the beginning of the 1900's? Did they abandon the efforts to extract?
3932 2018-05-26 22:27:43 Abi? Oil dey your head sisi 
3933 2018-05-26 22:27:35 Saudis squeezed the supply to drive up oil prices. Friends of yours, no?
3934 2018-05-26 22:27:16 Um. Ah. We did that on purpose with the EVAT. Easier to tax oil companies. Administrative ease as I argued...I mean as Ralph Recto argued. Blame him. Yes. Him.
3935 2018-05-26 22:27:15 Apparently there’s a gorilla masquerading as a mechanic here in Bennington because I just rounded the fuck out of the oil drain bolt he tightened.

But the oil filter turns nicely by hand so maybe he has a sensitive side.

3939 2018-05-26 22:26:45 The wealth extracted from Ireland by the landed gentry was the equivalent to North Sea oil in the 90s.   Gold taken from the Indigenous  Americans built Europe and paid off Elizabeth I national debt and helped build the Empire.

3945 2018-05-26 22:26:05 Was Maduro’s release of Holt just a post-election goodwill gesture, or was “something” offered, despite Trump admin saying there wasn’t?

Clearly, nothing tangible like elimination of sanctions was on the table but perhaps other assurances, at least from Corker, on oil sanctions.
3946 2018-05-26 22:26:03 Coconut oil is my saviour
3947 2018-05-26 22:25:57 Ke what are u doing here
3948 2018-05-26 22:25:41 Higher oil prices maybe good for North Dakota, but for the consumer , especially the farm community it flat out sucks $3.00 a gallon gas is ridiculous
3949 2018-05-26 22:25:39 if any of the oil tycoons or secret monarchs or elderly near-death billionaires want to buy me some shoes I would appreciate it... otherwise ya called being selfish

3954 2018-05-26 22:24:46 In that situation .... "cannabis" isn't needed . CBD oil would be more beneficial.  You might suggest they research that . CBS oil hasn't been passed a schedule 1 yet (as far as I know) so in alot of States it's easily found and in comparison much more affordable . Just an fyi
3955 2018-05-26 22:24:45 your girl has started taking in olive oil and applying rose water, nothing can hinder my way to good skin days now bas
3956 2018-05-26 22:24:34 Thanks to the low IQ  of TRUMP  we are now looking at inflation rates that could wipe out 7% or more of your incoe thanks to TRUMP trying to do away with Obama s Iran accord.  Oil prices will likely never come back down but continue to rise as Iran has 25% of the worlds oil.
3957 2018-05-26 22:24:12 The UK didn't invest in North Sea Oil for decades. That's the point. Being part of the UK Means we make very little money from oil.

We don't have a time machine, true. But we do have another chance. Scotland has huge renewable energy resources: the UK is investing in nuclear.

3961 2018-05-26 22:23:02 So now that I've had every medical professional and my therapist recommend CBD oil to me for pain relief, I bought some and I'm skin testing now to see if it gives me a rash. Here's hoping I'm not allergic; I'd love to have more pain relief options!
3962 2018-05-26 22:22:29 Problem is that Biden gave us the 2005 bankruptcy bill for@his pals in DE. He gave us Clarence Thomas by not calling other witnesses to backup Anita Hill. His son is on the Ukrainian National oil/gas board.  I’ll take a big pass on Ole Joe

3965 2018-05-26 22:21:21 Governments make plenty off oil and gas already. They just like to spend it where Norway saved it. They have a large oil reserve, a smaller country and only 5 million people. Plus Petro Canada was a crown corp until the liberals sold it.

3980 2018-05-26 22:19:23 Hey @realDonaldTrump. I know you're (your? who cares?!) into lies and racism, so would you like to debate those issues with someone who's (that's TWO apostrophes there Donny) half as thick as you? Like pigshit? Or eggnog? Snake oil?
3981 2018-05-26 22:19:21 How about...La Niña. Lane is super saturated(hence the name) with oil that you have to bowl really slow to make anything hook. We talking wall to wall, gutter to gutter.

I would like to recommend also a generic-ish vinaigrette (oil, white wine vinegar, mustard, season to taste) and a blank-slate red sauce (tomatoes, onion, garlic, parsley)
3986 2018-05-26 22:18:35 Wouldn't surprise me if I'm completely off base but can't see the Caps dealing w/ the Knights pace. On the iffy side of the equation, MAF looked to be favouring his hip area the last game. If that becomes a thing, we are talking a different series.

4020 2018-05-26 22:15:14 There "is reasons," alright. The reasons is that oil capital would rather have the necessary upgrade work done by an effective slave in China and pocket the difference between what he's getting paid and what they'd have to pay you.

4028 2018-05-26 22:14:12 What climate leadership? All I see is a petulant child instead of a premier. We need to stop with the tarsands, stop with the pipelines, responsibly deal with the toxic trailing ponds. We need to stop with corporate welfare for oil companies.

4030 2018-05-26 22:14:03 It’s just depressing. I can’t read anymore about the oil. We might never get to benefit from it the way that Norway has from theirs. It’s just gonna get drained out of Scotland to the benefit of others. Makes you sick.

4070 2018-05-26 22:06:38 Remember that's 6.2 billion on 240 billion in sales. that's a 2.5% profit margin, not much better than most retailers. Oil has a very low profit margin, this isn't Apple or Microsoft.

4072 2018-05-26 22:06:17 Actually as the price of gas goes up we pay less tax per%,  exept for GST rest of the tax are per litters, so % of tax goes down when the oil comp decide to gouge you. GST been a % just follow the price and stay at 5% wich is just following inflation or deflation for that matter
4073 2018-05-26 22:05:55 However, in a field where doctors and technicians share the same space, doctors will naturally rise to the top, as oil floats to the top of your stew... it's just the way it is. Because their training and qualifications speak for them.

4080 2018-05-26 22:03:28 How about some actual numbers? How big is the Iranian economy? How big is its tradable goods sector. Who buys the oil? 

Last I heard the Europe was responsible for 600 billion trade surplus. Who's demand is that appropriating? Does any of it go to Iran?
4081 2018-05-26 22:03:05 @BritniB714 still need to know how to get Cracker Jack oil out of the bottom of my @adidas

4083 2018-05-26 22:02:23 Heh. Two countries in the crosshairs for decades, one for its sugar industry and the other for the "largest verifiable oil" resources on the planet, and two countries the CIA have been trying to overthrow for over half a century.

4086 2018-05-26 22:02:14 When JB was a chef in the TA, he was once ignored by his colleagues after experiencing some nasty oil splatter. Still rankles.
4087 2018-05-26 22:01:26 The worst part of this sad story is that this dictatorship survives thanks to $$ coming from democratic countries who keep buying Venezuelan oil. Isn’t this like having blood in their hands, just like Maduro and his gang ?!
4088 2018-05-26 22:01:07 Govt of India enjoyed the $50/barrel crude oil and kept increasing excise duty to keep the price constant. But the same government now doesn't want to decrease the excise to keep the prices checked.

4090 2018-05-26 22:00:49 To the contrary, energy would finally be priced in a free currency mkt for the 1st time in 100+ yrs.  Putin isnt wrong - the USD’s monopoly in oil trading is a big problem for the global economy.  I hear there are those at global CB’s that agree w Putin but can’t do so publicly

4094 2018-05-26 22:00:15 Oil bai hahaha inglish pala yon hahah
4095 2018-05-26 22:00:12 We need something done about oil prices.
4096 2018-05-26 22:00:04 because Coke is for cleaning oil off the cement.
4097 2018-05-26 22:00:04 LADIES PICTURE THIS: it’s 15 yrs from now. The US is completely cut off from the rest of the world. Everyone walks because we can’t get oil from the Middle East. Human trafficking is flourishing because ICE gave them our children. Your 4yo sons teacher keeps a gun at his desk.

4103 2018-05-26 21:59:32 They call me olive oil.
Because I’m extra virgin.
4104 2018-05-26 21:59:09 Won't be allowed to happen to the degree we've been promised. Do you have any idea what will happen to our economy if demand for oil falls below a certain point? It will crash it and we will lose our status as the world economic leader. One word: petrodollar.
4105 2018-05-26 21:58:37 It’s painful, but you don’t know that having never been near to a final even with your oil money.
4106 2018-05-26 21:58:34 Got some CBD oil today and Charcoal tablets. Supplement experiments. Interest to see if the CBD oil will do some changes. X
4107 2018-05-26 21:58:24 Clueless. With Suncor refinery turnaround & partial Shell/Imperial Oil refinery turnarounds - all in Edmonton... no refined fuels (gas/diesel) flowing through TMP into Lower Mainland/Van Isle markets for past ~7 weeks. All now imported from WA State refineries in $US = $premium$.
4108 2018-05-26 21:58:23 How about no longer using oil for other than its intended purpose? What is next, gravel or water hazards? #smfh

4110 2018-05-26 21:57:42 Isn’t the price of oil global? So yes you can thank Trump. Best way to avoid paying a high price for gas is to buy an electric car. Best move I ever made.
4111 2018-05-26 21:57:28 Ya boi going for his physical and drug screening this tuesday and I'll be working on an oil rig making bank, thank you God for steering me towards the right positions at the right times, couldn't do this on my own.

4114 2018-05-26 21:56:17 It may not and I can’t predict the future. However the world is awash in oil and demand is not increasing rapidly. Absent a war in Iran for example it’s likely to stay in the $65-$75 range for years. I’m an executive in oil and gas and look at data daily.
4115 2018-05-26 21:56:03 I will continue to improve you - both as a writer and a person - and I can only hope that you will thank me one day…

4120 2018-05-26 21:55:41 Y'all getting cars cuz you going to war, have fun securing our oil!
4121 2018-05-26 21:55:40 Yea and you’re giving straight to the oil companies with that 3.29 gas. Greedy ole party capitalism at work

4129 2018-05-26 21:54:43 I'm terribly bad at solving riddles, but you had me at your palm, for you have very nice ones. Now I can think of one or two things that do belong in them, fitting or not... hmmm, add a bit of oil... might be wrong answer, but a very nice one.
4130 2018-05-26 21:54:42 No..don’t need chemicals..I just use dryer balls with essential oil!
4131 2018-05-26 21:54:31 A president typically has no control over or anything to do with the fluctuation of oil prices which cause gas prices to rise. Except in this case. Trump actually caused the price of gas to rise dramatically & quickly. Thanks you douchebag @realDonaldTrump #MemorialDay
4132 2018-05-26 21:54:24 My mother would have pulled me off the floor by the hair of my sideburn. Slapped the shit out of me, told me I looked ridiculous, and forced me to walk home because I was too filthy from lying on that disgusting floor. Then I would get in trouble when my dad found out.
4133 2018-05-26 21:54:04 adrian took my car to get an oil change while I was working HE IS A FUCKING QUEEEN
4134 2018-05-26 21:53:54 So Jody, the part that was left out was the great migration and shift of party agenda and membership after 1964 into the 1980’s. The old guard of “Southern Democrats” no longer exist. If you thought I would not have a rebuttal to that, you were mistaken.
4135 2018-05-26 21:53:34 I use @NaturesUltra CBD Oil Roll Ons for my neck. Works great for me.
4136 2018-05-26 21:53:31 What's in it for Devin Nunes? (Connections to big oil/Russia?) Will he ever face legal consequences for the tremendous damage he's done to our democracy - abetting obstruction, conspiracy or any other violations of the rule of law?
4137 2018-05-26 21:53:30 Organic coconut oil is one of the best natural moisturizers for the skin. If you can't eat it, you shouldn't be putting it on your skin! :)
4138 2018-05-26 21:53:24 Conoco has a $2 billion court judgement against Venezuela so they siezed some product. So the oil supply chain is fouled up.
4139 2018-05-26 21:53:23 You mean pipeline that carries refined jet fuel made from oil sands crude coming from Alberta down to Washington State via pipeline approved? Damn! We have to learn how those Americans can take our "dangerous" and "dirty" Alberta Oil and make it all safe and clean.

4163 2018-05-26 21:49:35 Coconut oil only for the body! It’s highly comedogenic which means it will clog pores. I used it a bit before on my face before I found out and was wondering why it left my acne worse. Haven’t tried witch hazel.

2. panini bread (or ciabatta), feta cheese, tomatoes, a bit of olive oil and oregano.

4178 2018-05-26 21:46:39 $70 oil is a sweet spot where the domestic oil industry does well and the consumers are not paying very high prices. It gets us closer to energy independence because it incentivizes more exploration and drilling.
4179 2018-05-26 21:46:37 Guess who managed to spill about a half a bottle of olive oil?  I just grabbed some towels, stood on them, absorbed what I could then degreased the floor. I of course, threw the bottle away first.
4180 2018-05-26 21:46:27 he's guilty of High Treason: a Russian asset, doing business with Communist China ... he needs to be in Club Fed from now on.

he scribbles on oil paintings just to leave his mark, but wouldn't touch a Pollock 'cause no one would notice.

4209 2018-05-26 21:40:32 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
4210 2018-05-26 21:40:32 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
4211 2018-05-26 21:40:26 Family of Secrets by Russ Baker is a must read.  It drew chaffing  i.e. articles AROUND it designed to conflate what Baker writes with disinfo.  Great stuff here on the structural aspects of us oil trade and its overlap with US foreign policy in key period. 1920s badly misunderst

(I started using lavender essential oil to deodorize our bathroom)
4214 2018-05-26 21:39:50 U should be thanking Obama.. I hope to see an increase in oil production in the US also have u noticed that EPA regulations require a reformulation of fuels for spring an another for summer? So inventories are low for now. Plus increased economic activity. Way in on this.
4215 2018-05-26 21:39:40 I believed from the start that Rex Tillerson was going to be a very fortunate oil man from the Trump Putin alliance. Your take?
4216 2018-05-26 21:39:27 We created one of the greatest players to ever play the game, get over it use oil merchants
4217 2018-05-26 21:39:27 The oil that my face manufactures in every hour is enough to fry 1 kg of chicken.
4218 2018-05-26 21:39:15 I get that policy makers and citizens alike are generally ok with choosing big oil over the environment.. but choosing it over human lives I can’t understand
4219 2018-05-26 21:39:14 studies confirm that that once DT issues an executive order, Paul Ryan silently prays for help #resist
4220 2018-05-26 21:39:03 What pop song would act as the theme tune for an 80s Allo Allo style sitcom, set in a British oil workers' illicit whisky refinery + strip club in  Riyadh, called 'Allah Forbids It' or 'Saud this for a game of Soldiers'?

4221 2018-05-26 21:38:33 Dat Liverpool coach nor get oil for head o @LFC
4222 2018-05-26 21:38:29 @davidhogg111 and his band of brownshirt thugs strike again. Extortion is now legal?
4223 2018-05-26 21:37:59 Excellent... a little sad at the same time. 
Your neighbour obviously hadn't read about the new catastrophe we are facing from the rising fuel costs caused by this volatile oil. It's a nightmare- difficult to get off yer claithes etc. Did I say it was volatile? #volatile
4224 2018-05-26 21:37:44 “Grace Ferment”? Is that another word for cofveve? (Even when Don the Con cultists are incomprehensible, you know they’re still lying through their teeth! It’s an art form perfected by their false prophet & snake oil salesman in chief, the money laundering magaT himself!)
4225 2018-05-26 21:37:41 for you are with me;
your rod & your staff,
they comfort me.
You prepare a table
before me in the presence
of my enemies;
you anoint my head with oil;
my cup overflows.
Surely goodness&mercy
shall follow me all the days
of my life,& I shall dwell in
the house of the LORD forever.
4226 2018-05-26 21:37:29 That’s what happens when gentrification hits cuisine. Clean oil, polite demarcation and good manners have ruined your peirogies. And no sour cream? A horror.
4227 2018-05-26 21:37:20 the entire situation would be fixed if Suncor built an oil refinery in Alberta instead of trying to ship bitumen to Houston for refining. My close friends and associates are split 50/50 on this one
4228 2018-05-26 21:37:15 I hate when recipes tell you to combine melted coconut oil with eggs. Because Americans keep their eggs in the fridge; they're always cold. 
Always cold enough to immediately harden that coconut oil, so it will never, ever blend in like an oil.
4229 2018-05-26 21:37:09 dude coconut oil lotion for the face is clutch 10/10 recommend
4230 2018-05-26 21:37:05 Dude, you’re the one buying snake oil because you needed to be called a bottom feeder and for someone to tell you to clean your room. 
4231 2018-05-26 21:36:59 Lmfao!! Yall should have opened all the blinds, turned in the lights and put flashlights on his ass! Or put a lighter to some oil sheen and torched baby count dracula
4232 2018-05-26 21:36:57 A family member of mine used CBD oil for her depression and so far she’s been doing fantastic if you’re looking for an alternative.  I hope you’re doing alright as you’re a wonderful artist and an even cooler human being
4233 2018-05-26 21:36:47 You can bet if Trump and clan have ANY influence in this matter the taxpayer WILL be stuck with the bill and his loyal and poorly informed lower-middle class followers will readily support him and the GOP in making that happen while the elite watch their oil stock values rise.
4234 2018-05-26 21:36:37 If I could fix my life with a bottle of coconut oil I would.
4235 2018-05-26 21:36:37 If you have a beard and don’t use beard oil, you’re doing yourself a major disservice
4236 2018-05-26 21:36:32 Hope you own nothing that is made of oil product or runs on oil product. You should be wearing nothing but a fig leaf. Throw your phone away you hypocrite.
4237 2018-05-26 21:36:20 I see u olive oil 
4238 2018-05-26 21:36:13 And you maybe lucky that you don't have oil, because in most parts of the world created lazy freeloaders and corrupt scumbags that suppressed the nations' economic potentials. Iran and Venezuela are good examples, would've been free/democratic, richer & more advanced without oil
4239 2018-05-26 21:36:08 Pro tip: getchya oil changed today cause there’s no other cars in the bay today lol

4247 2018-05-26 21:34:43 nope. when oil prices are higher, the local economy flourished, although I'm sure there is a point of diminishing returns.
4248 2018-05-26 21:34:25 What Oil Company do you work for?
4249 2018-05-26 21:34:24 Ustaz yayi zagi da azumi
4250 2018-05-26 21:34:17 And that's great!  But the money isn't coming from the oilsands or even the bulk of it from the oil companies.  It is coming from the taxes the employees (and the rest of Albertans) pay.  Includes employees of other companies, and those companies too, of course.
4251 2018-05-26 21:34:05 Don't tell big oil. They will try to sabotage the program.

If you are not sure if your #US #OIl trades are going to be winners, buying #WTI options is a good idea to hedge your positions. This is a kind of trading insurance, so to speak.
4260 2018-05-26 21:32:34 The first question is why petrol is going down, and how can you help to reduce it? Is Cyril responsible for US to cancel the Iran deal? Is Cyril responsible for the change in oil prices?
4261 2018-05-26 21:32:17 I think the people at jiffy lube that changed my oil really stole my sunglasses

#US #Oil's 4% fall Friday is a big deal on #WTI D1 or H4 but not so much on monthly. It's only a dent on the powerful uptrend so far. The chances of monthly Doji becoming a transitional candle are not low at this point.
4283 2018-05-26 21:29:07 I’m house sitting for my friends this weekend and they gave me full access to their hash oil. Needless to say, I’m gonna be taking a lot of naps this Memorial Day.
4284 2018-05-26 21:29:06 Your dumbass #POTUS raised the price of crude oil across the globe by withdrawing from the #IranDeal and you have the nerve to piss on #California for paying for our infrastructure repairs with a tax?  You raised the deficit by over a trillion #California has a budget surplus
4285 2018-05-26 21:29:02 #SaudiArabia: I appreciated the open words of prince whatever to stop business with Germany.I did business over there. It is the most hostile&totalitary country I have every visited. Lets check how to completely avoid buying oil from Saudi Arabia

4289 2018-05-26 21:28:29 In fact he must investigate why there were many transformers that were failing in the past that might have led to loss of trillions. Seems some cartels were importing fake transformers and blaming oil siphoning when they failed.
4290 2018-05-26 21:28:27 Aw idk of this can help but I got an oil stain on my pants once and I used dawn dish soap bc that’s supposed to help with grease so I scrubbed my pants with it and it came off but I did it as soon as it happened so idk if that will help if the stain has been there for a while.
4291 2018-05-26 21:28:20 I feel bad for Egypt

4296 2018-05-26 21:27:21 Is there a football club in the world (that isn't funded by a Billionaire oil tycoon/criminal) that can genuinely afford Bale? I'm not so sure, especially when the selling club can point to THAT performance and say "he's worth it"
4297 2018-05-26 21:27:13 Have always thought oil, like all commodities, was basically a demand trade. Saudis, for ex, excellent at tracking supply, they know where to find every barrel in the world, but they stink at demand.
4298 2018-05-26 21:26:48 Phoebe sat in pine sap. I didn’t want to use oil to remove it so I tried liquid Castile soap and water, and a rag. It worked!

4305 2018-05-26 21:26:06 All Vince McMahon care about is the zeros on each and very deal that he signed. A ten year deal with the oil kingdom locked. Domestic Tv deals locked. He need all the money to cover back the money he used for his XFL 2.0
4306 2018-05-26 21:26:03 The market drops like a stone on the basis of oil...talk.  Yup.
4307 2018-05-26 21:25:54 That's the cost of getting a tax cut and him breaking a treaty that holds the oil. There is always a price to pay.
4308 2018-05-26 21:25:50 Tough. But I think Washington finally does the thing. 6 games clinch on home ice.
4309 2018-05-26 21:25:39 I’m probably every mechanics dream customer...I went in for a $20 oil change and ended up getting all of my filters changed, new windshield wipers, and donated to a kid in need. I did get 25% off the oil change and an extra water though so I guess that’s something 
4310 2018-05-26 21:25:26 Miss you more imma go see you next week .. after I get my oil change
4311 2018-05-26 21:25:11 R4 is supposed to be educated and educational. But Today broadcasts total drivel from various snake oil politicians and no one with any expertise is called in to challenge this. So depressing.
4312 2018-05-26 21:24:48 its not about the oil, its about eventually seeing sense, the being in with the wrong crowd, eventually makes you as stupid as them, lets make sure that the human sacrifice that people gave for Scotland's freedom throughout its history, is not wasted this time around
4313 2018-05-26 21:24:46 Called Cramer once about 9 years ago for lightning round and he was rude, stopped watching his show about 7 yrs ago thought he was a snake oil salesman, never realized what a sleaze he really is. Action Alert can't even beat S&P. Love the podcasts, rage against the machine
4314 2018-05-26 21:24:13 not just that he stole this art, but the lying skill GODDAMN!! now he better oil that hole for what's coming his way
4315 2018-05-26 21:23:36 Unless you doing some really fun stuff... Dates are to appease women... Like getting your oil changed

4322 2018-05-26 21:22:13 Easy enough. Just raise prices. Sure you will be ok with that.
4323 2018-05-26 21:22:12 We’re definitely not developed, but for a country that is in a hostile region, 100 million ppl, no oil/gas and has 30 years of communism behind us..we are doing OK. That doesn’t mean that we will stop until we reach the top. There’s no reason for us to not be greater than Germany
4324 2018-05-26 21:22:06 Get on the oil life man.
4325 2018-05-26 21:22:02 Me: Babe I need bath supplies

Him: I only Whore Olive Oil
4326 2018-05-26 21:21:43 Called in to ask for a oil change last week. £474 for it. They can fook off. Taking it somewhere else now.
4327 2018-05-26 21:21:16 Just a note, the oil and minerals in this big country really belongs to all of us. The oil barrens and miners didn’t create any of it and we do all of the work to extract it. Everyone should benefit from our riches, not only the greedy owners. #Unionize
4328 2018-05-26 21:21:11 it has oil stains on it and now it seems that some chemical got on it and it has spots of discoloration
4329 2018-05-26 21:21:01 CBD oil is not marijuana, anyway. It has less than 3% thc. Your doctor must prefer pills and be in his 60s.
4330 2018-05-26 21:20:53 Olive oil and salt work on everything
4331 2018-05-26 21:20:40 An artwork - saw it myself. It's oil I think.
4332 2018-05-26 21:20:11 Have you ever tried coconut oil or witch hazel?

4335 2018-05-26 21:19:44 You can watch it all on Lucas Oil Racing TV
4336 2018-05-26 21:19:36 @realDonaldTrump regarding Venezuela, has huge oil reserves that could benefit America. You should deal with President Nicolas Maduro promising economic  help as in food and supplies helping our farmers and ranchers, in exchange for cheap oil. Have Mike Pompeo wave the carrot.
4337 2018-05-26 21:19:35 More oil spills they don't tell us about will happen!
4338 2018-05-26 21:19:35 And they may. By tacking on an extra 15- 20 cents at the pump or more.  We will all be winning then, right? 
4339 2018-05-26 21:19:31 How much free cash did we get for being runners up? Must be a bob or two....no oil money involved there.
4340 2018-05-26 21:19:24 If they can arrange to do one of these at the Target across the street, I can arrange to roll my wheelchair over there and perhaps over them.
4341 2018-05-26 21:19:17 オイルだからってオイルツイートばかりな訳じゃないぞ。油ツイートもするよ。
4342 2018-05-26 21:19:11 I put baby oil on them for in my car (with leather seats) now my seats all oily! 
4343 2018-05-26 21:19:09 Well,we don't have oil,so we actually have to do something in order to survive. The last famine in Europe because of natural causes happened in Finland. After WWII Finland was the poorest country in Western Europe,12% of the total population were refugees who had lost everything.

4345 2018-05-26 21:18:31 Today’s cool bath is spiked with tangerine essential oil soon I will be a refreshing citrus slice of a human being
4346 2018-05-26 21:18:23 I'd def recommend trying out the spray with one of the creams/lotions with the oil spray and a grease. Grease is what rly extends the softness for me. I usually reach for the Softee Indian Hemp grease, but any should work.
4347 2018-05-26 21:17:49 Trump Snake Oil being consumed by his followers every day in swallowing his daily lies and accepting his crimes.
4348 2018-05-26 21:17:43 But consider also that Iran gets more net $ sale proceeds by selling 3m bpd at $70/bbl than from 4m bpd at $50/bbl & get to keep the sanctioned oil in the ground #OOTT
4349 2018-05-26 21:17:38 Frying everything in oil is one the 5 major food groups of the Scottish. 
4350 2018-05-26 21:17:37 I disagree David. What's to stop a First Nation ownership group from extorting higher and higher fees from oil companies from using their pipeline. Horrible idea, and a terrifying thought that only First Nations can build a pipeline that is in ALL of Canada's national interest
4351 2018-05-26 21:17:28 Ok, but we are still running out of oil, at least if we not use more ethanol. Then we run out of food... 
4352 2018-05-26 21:17:28 And we will never follow
4353 2018-05-26 21:17:17 I cook on vacation b/c I like to visit local farmers markets & if I’m near the sea buy everything local even herbs and spices. But I usually do travel with my own olive oil unless I’m going someplace where I can meet other olive oil producers #knowyourfarmer
4354 2018-05-26 21:17:11 I wouldn’t even laugh if somebody tell me they’re mortally afraid of hot oil
4355 2018-05-26 21:16:59 Fico pensando... vamos voltar a viver aquele tempo em que o Oil subia e o prejuízo da PETR aumentava!?
4356 2018-05-26 21:16:48 When I were a young'un all we had for breakfast was a dose of castor oil, and had only a waterfall in the desert to look forward to for supper!
4357 2018-05-26 21:16:41 Like the corporate tax debate, consumers/taxpayers foot the bill either way. Same way as  Gov money is myth/shell game used to sell  agendas
4358 2018-05-26 21:16:29 Experience is the best...groundnut oil is not crude oil
4359 2018-05-26 21:16:14 The US has by far the greatest Oil Reserve’s yet, it’s a good idea to use everyone else’s Oil first..... Oil will not run out any time soon!
4360 2018-05-26 21:16:04 I got a call from oil & gas recruiters today. Price is now viable to employ more people I guess. I bet they don't revert to 2 week rotations offshore from 3 weeks. It went up to that to cut costs. Told them to ram it.
4361 2018-05-26 21:15:46 You cooking "sprit" now, Stephen? Tell me... do you use butter or olive oil?

4365 2018-05-26 21:15:06 The growth commission plan is to get the Scottish defecit to 3% of GDP by 2032. That's 18 years after the oil price crash. Interesting when you consider the SNP's repeated attempts to ridicule the UK Govt's attempts to reduce the deficit.
4366 2018-05-26 21:15:03 You might call spending oil money on schools and hospitals in such a way. I wouldn't.
4367 2018-05-26 21:14:30 Depends if you drive ... or if you are Putin or an oil company
4368 2018-05-26 21:14:29 Dudu osun black soap and vitamin e oil saved my skin
4369 2018-05-26 21:14:27 Oh sweets! You are certainly in for one deep slumber! We would love to hear how you enjoy the dreamy lavender and chamomile oil combination! 
4370 2018-05-26 21:14:06 So we all know Oil is cooking’s greatest common denominator. 

Infuse oil with flavor (which is cannabis) and your head just might explode with joy.

Want to know why?
4371 2018-05-26 21:14:02 Too much olive oil on his fucking top knot the German prick

4373 2018-05-26 21:13:57 Even though it’s nothing bad, I just thing it’s funny when they blurt out “y’all got any of that weed oil” lmao
4374 2018-05-26 21:13:50 I agree US is number 1 in world regarding oil! Used foreign oil when US had World reserves good business!
However killing consumers with high prices!
Love Chinese symbol for  Chrises  as Opertunity! High price is crisis alternate fuel is opertunity!
4375 2018-05-26 21:13:42 Got fucking oil on my legs, I’m about to fucking fry 
4376 2018-05-26 21:13:36 You are of course assuming that GBP doesn't lose value on Scottish exit.
Given that North sea oil would be lost to GBP and so the balance of payments deteriorates, the GBP could well fall.

4378 2018-05-26 21:13:20 Whole world are into gst, even countries that are reach with resources. So must we malaysia, we cannot rely on oil forever
4379 2018-05-26 21:13:16 I get so many people asking about CBD oil at my store... like Bruh, ask your plug, don’t come into my store tryna make me sound like a dealer lol

4381 2018-05-26 21:13:11 I'm amazed people use mechanics to get their tires, oil, or brakes changed.

For the brake pads and roters it cost me about $250 - as opposed to a mechanic $650.

People talk about "self sufficiency" but can't muster up the confidence to work on their vehicles?

4383 2018-05-26 21:12:59 In the early days, it seemed rosneft was going to be the central feature of trumps criminal pay for play. 1. Do you think trump is conspiring w Russia and saudis to drive up oil prices, and 2. Will it all eventually come back to OIL$$?

4392 2018-05-26 21:11:44 Could you oil yourself up next time maybe?
4393 2018-05-26 21:11:36 I did not say only for Russia!  It must be kept in mind that American-imposed sanctions are intended to damage Russia's economy, so higher oil prices will help to offset such effects.

4423 2018-05-26 21:07:18 I'm in a place called the Gas City. Once was a major oilfield hub. That's why it bothers me. She needs to work harder. I lost my business because of the price of oil.

4428 2018-05-26 21:06:27 I’m not concerned about cheaping out. It’s just questioning the life of an oil filter is all.

4434 2018-05-26 21:05:09 Time to oil it. But maybe not for it to dry fully I'd say. End up with those annoying water splash patches
4435 2018-05-26 21:05:00 I’m torn on this topic hate oil being priced so high I’m a conservative living in CA odd I know... but seeing oil spikes in bush & DT piss me off although moon beam browns gas tax hasn’t helped us ughhhhhhh
4436 2018-05-26 21:04:57 Forget the propaganda. Check the IFS stats. More is spent on Scotland than is raised in revenue and that includes oil. The fact you think being British is an inconvenience shows your views on sharing.

4442 2018-05-26 21:04:06 I guess I'll be that guy that says, "Um, actually..."

When Obama took office, oil prices were at dizzying heights the world had never seen. This made it profitable for oil companies to use more expensive methods for oil extraction, resulting in a boom, and lower prices.
4443 2018-05-26 21:03:53 I wish I had the means to experiment with different mediums. It's probably just an excuse. I would love to have a go at oil paints on a huge canvas... But how? Can you rent space in an art studio like you can a music studio?

4455 2018-05-26 21:01:27 People need to see oil as a 20th century product.

Why should we not lead the world in innovation?
4456 2018-05-26 21:01:19 Depends on how good the filter and the oil is. It’s also usually the cheapest part to buy for a change but serves a pretty critical purpose. Why cheap out on something that important basically.

4466 2018-05-26 21:00:14 To me he looks transparently like a shill for big oil by claiming outright that gasoline powered cars are the future and EV's a flash in the pan, visible only through superior salesmanship.  Obv sales is all he can wrap head around.

4470 2018-05-26 20:59:53 Haven’t driven a car in almost two months now so I’m excited today but also hesitant because I knew I needed an oil change before I stopped driving

4483 2018-05-26 20:57:52 HP is funded by the CATO Institute which has deep connections to oil companies and is deeply hostile to environmental movements of all kinds. I'd double check this with mainstream science publications.
4484 2018-05-26 20:57:39 You meant wormhole
4485 2018-05-26 20:57:39 寝る！！
4486 2018-05-26 20:57:07 It's just the thought that will ruin it for me always. It's like the whipped cream commercial where the waitress ask's the lady do You want Cream or Oil on your pumpkin pie/.
4487 2018-05-26 20:56:54 TBQH could not tell you the diff between oil and gasoline
4488 2018-05-26 20:56:47 It was not a mistake, it was a pre planned deliberate attack to grab the oil fields and in the process of the war make Billions for Haliburton and friends.
4489 2018-05-26 20:56:35 Well that is what got the USA into Iraq and now going after Iran. Yet the Saudi Arabia controls oil price. Purchase that big thirsty suv. You giving some of your money to Saudi Arabia. The ones that financed 911.
4490 2018-05-26 20:56:32 in need of CBD oil for these cramps. 
4491 2018-05-26 20:56:19 99% CBD oil legitimately stops anxiety and panic attacks and completely relaxes you, I would strongly suggest everybody take one droplet of 99% CBD and try to tell me different
4492 2018-05-26 20:56:18 I am not careless. I hate fanatics deeply the Islamic ones more. Yet Sep 11 was used to break 3 anti-Jihadi countries of Iraq, Libya( hub of human trafficking now), secular Syria(solely for oil, Iran /strategic depth for golan heights, anti-Assad rebels became IS).
4493 2018-05-26 20:55:58 The only way to truly know is to test your oil.  Not hard or expensive but I don't do it much.  I just change the filter with each oil change.
4494 2018-05-26 20:55:58 How can I get your oil in INDIA? Can you suggest some good oil seller?
4495 2018-05-26 20:55:42 HEY TRUMP HAVE U CHECKED OUTRAGEOUS GAS PRICES UR VOTERS ARE PAYING TO TRAVEL???WHAT DO U OWE BIG OIL??? 70 MILLION INQUIRING MINDS WANNNA KNOW!!!

4500 2018-05-26 20:54:36 The greatest football team in the history of the game. Hate them all you want but at least they aren’t ran by oil money.
4501 2018-05-26 20:54:31 My dad and I are oil and water FR
4502 2018-05-26 20:53:50 Oh, he is/was indeed! What moldern American Presidential candidate can get by without the money from Big Oil, (other than Bernie Sanders, that is?) Just nowhere  near to the extent the Clintons collected both Personally and politically from the Saudis/Big oil!!
4503 2018-05-26 20:53:43 At any given time I always have coconut oil and olive oil in the cupboard. Currently, avocado oil as well 
4504 2018-05-26 20:53:40 Am I gonna have time to oil the decking in the morning? #RainhamEssex

4507 2018-05-26 20:53:20 I think the next 100 million goes to buying us a new goalkeeper . Karius seems to have soaked his gloves in oil this evening
4508 2018-05-26 20:53:11 โทนี่ โครส นี่ตั้งแต่ย้ายไปมาดริด ไม่ได้แชมป์รายการนี้ปีเดียวเองมั้ง อีเหี้ย โหดไป
4509 2018-05-26 20:53:10 We are well on our way back to $4.00/gallon gasoline again.  Especially if Iran oil sales are restricted again.
4510 2018-05-26 20:53:08 And olive oil ...
4511 2018-05-26 20:53:03 This is all about uk establishment wanting Saudis to float 5% of there oil company on the British stock market,worth billions,Saudis calling the shots,medieval rich men in dresses dictating to our government,mosques buildings and treatment to anything anti Muslim ,scum money.
4512 2018-05-26 20:52:55 No they say there fucking bribing the ref with money supplied by oil rich club owners
4513 2018-05-26 20:52:54 percaya lah, gua pake tomat di bekuin sama kleveru sunflower+grapeseed oil, pori pori gue skrg mulai mengecil heuheu
4514 2018-05-26 20:52:51 Some rich Indian guy who owns oil just wire transferred a mil to Karius fam in east Berlin
4515 2018-05-26 20:52:43 A little bit of good intel and one  bomb  could rid us of ASSAD....but then, where would we be?  GB and France are responsible for setting-up this mess (for oil !) after WW1 AND WE CANNOT SOLVE IT!
4516 2018-05-26 20:52:39 I am sure you have the oil stains in your underwear
4517 2018-05-26 20:52:36 Zidane,  the man with oil on his head,  history maker.

4524 2018-05-26 20:50:10 This is like PSE Exec is boat captain on the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill disaster. Only this socioeconomic horror 4decades of fraud. The ACPE has no observable ethics oversight and has positioned it's self in State Executive management by liberty of #AkLeg Statutes. Avarice elitists!
4525 2018-05-26 20:50:08 Who we found oil
4526 2018-05-26 20:49:33 @claimsfive There was no baby oil in sight  and no photoshopping. As you can see from the picture it was a dull day too! That is just how good Albaasil looks in the flesh. Excellent photography from @sharidoranphoto too
4527 2018-05-26 20:49:25 #Nifty - 3 tensions eased to some extent this week :
1) #Crude oil Prices (Saudi & Russia hints to raise output) 
2) #Rupee depreciation (crude oil impact)
3) #FED rate hike (pace will be normal as indicated by FED)

#Nifty Resistance : 10659
4528 2018-05-26 20:49:15 You're a snake oil salesman. You lie like a  rug.
4529 2018-05-26 20:49:14 Italian loaf split with butter, garlic, black pepper, minced red onion, olive oil, five-cheese Italian blend (or whatever), thinly sliced scallion, minced parsley & grated Parmesan cheese... Just until crisp on the edges. It doesn't suck at all.
4530 2018-05-26 20:49:08 I’d love to see a reality show where Mike Rowe @mikeroweworks joins the 2018 workforce and has to work his way out of poverty. Like trying to get promotions and raises working as a Walmart Cashier. Or trying to make it in the Alberta Oil Fields where a jug of milk is $18....

4534 2018-05-26 20:48:20 @sm_sears FWIW your former Barron's followers/readers in the comments section are still asking for your take on options, especially regarding oil with all of the noise these days.
4535 2018-05-26 20:48:05 So you don't believe in climate change probably? But you believe there is this conspiracy of people doing their best to keep the price of Canadian oil low by fooling grandmothers and librarians into being concerned about the planet.
4536 2018-05-26 20:47:58 KALI MA and YEMAYA Candles scented with Custom Made Goddess Oil!!!
4537 2018-05-26 20:47:40 Iran could've ended every program they had including manned flight and offers is their entire stick of oil fields and GOP Congress wouldn't have approved it.
4538 2018-05-26 20:47:23 Eso si que es verdad, los animales lo pasan mal, Mickey rascando la ventana y oil ladrando debajo de la cama
4539 2018-05-26 20:47:18 @ShellStationsUK 1Litre of 5w30 oil £22 in your Barking garage, a tad excessive? I understand a fair markup given the convenience factor but that is a lot!
4540 2018-05-26 20:47:03 you know it’s summer when you can’t tell if it’s sweat or tanning oil
4541 2018-05-26 20:47:00 Dear @LFC
Please make Loris Karius a free agent.
Best regards.
4542 2018-05-26 20:46:50 enough is enough we dont want you mr secretary do any thing just be honest and clarify your position either you are with people or with regime ?this is message to all countries around the world we have been victims of oil war but now my generation will not forget who is with us
4543 2018-05-26 20:46:45 Can my car stop asking for an oil change everytime I'm looking forward to making other purchases.
4544 2018-05-26 20:46:42 Dekho. Collect the oil from your T-zone. And then pour it on yourself again.
4545 2018-05-26 20:46:35 
4546 2018-05-26 20:46:34 I have great respect for oil painters, it's really tough
4547 2018-05-26 20:46:31 I know their oil cleanser is good at removing makeup also.
4548 2018-05-26 20:46:09 デビルマンBOXどうしよう……絵コンテだけの本とか別ででないかなぁ…でないよねぇ…
4549 2018-05-26 20:45:57 Oh, you mean when the oil corps rob the American people of BILLIONS of dollars on Memorial/Labor Day Weekend just b/c they can? I always fill up a week or two early and drive very little on purpose.
4550 2018-05-26 20:45:48 The other thing might be some of the spray cooking oil after cleaning so the “wee biscuits” don’t stick
4551 2018-05-26 20:45:46 Liverpool Players are more slippery than oil.

Karius

4552 2018-05-26 20:45:43 That fan denied Ronaldo a chance to take off his shirt and showcase his new underwear and baby oil 
4553 2018-05-26 20:45:30 Buy some Suncor shares and profit from private enterprise. Oil prices are going up in USA and EU also.
4554 2018-05-26 20:45:26 I may have put too much sesame oil
4555 2018-05-26 20:45:11 ใช่ มันควรจะเกิดขึ้นมั้ย

4557 2018-05-26 20:45:04 I've been asking this for a while now: when does the FEC finally call these what they *really* are - in-kind contributions to PDT's 2020 re-election campaign.
4558 2018-05-26 20:45:02 Olive oil hands from Karius
4559 2018-05-26 20:45:01 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.

4562 2018-05-26 20:44:40 Walmart wanna charge me 80$ too for an oil change for my car  ask me if I wanna get another foreign car in the future & damn right i'll tell you that I'm gonna continue buying them  I love my car.
4563 2018-05-26 20:44:34 Scented with Custom made Goddess Oil!!!
4564 2018-05-26 20:44:28 Yeahhhhhhh I carry coconut oil in my gym bag ...
4565 2018-05-26 20:44:20 My husband likes measurements like "a grip of parsley" (however much fits in your hand) and "a glug of olive oil."

4569 2018-05-26 20:43:56 I could have performed better than @LorisKarius he applied oil to his fingers while fingering himself with gloves on, and forgot to clean
4570 2018-05-26 20:43:53 I finally shaved my arms today and am currently getting my car’s oil changed. Things are looking the fuck UP
4571 2018-05-26 20:43:52 Anecdotally, I think you may be on to something. I know many boomers who retired from oil&gas jobs in last 4 years who bought their NOLA dream house; some who had once lived in NOLA moved back in from Houston
4572 2018-05-26 20:43:52 I literally just want my oil changed. Stop telling me my car has $1000 worth of work that needs done. You’re scaring me

4578 2018-05-26 20:43:04 When i cut my hair its always at its curliest & its healthy. The longer it gets the more weight it’s pulling the curls & making them wavy! Do some simple hair treatments with coconut oil after her shower & rinse with cold water. Use a wide toothed comb. Like once a week maybe.
4579 2018-05-26 20:43:03 Honestly I just need my cannabis oil then I’ll be cool, you should get some too

4581 2018-05-26 20:42:55 Not when you let oil companies exported to other countries so they can get the price up and leave us exposed Obama had the right idea no exporting oil
4582 2018-05-26 20:42:35 เพื่อนๆต้องมาปลอบคาริอุส ถึงในใจคงจะแบบ มึงนะมึง
4583 2018-05-26 20:42:30 Well if you are blind to him and his billionaire buddies just getting richer by deregulating everything from the EPA and calling global warming a hoax, allowing oil drilling and mining in our national monuments and the Alaska wildlife reserve, deregulation the banks, go for it.
4584 2018-05-26 20:42:15 It isn't necessary mandates to force people to use computers, cell phones, washing machines; unlike solar panels/windmills, decorative facade for coal/oil/gas, useless placebos, that needed to be imposed.
"good ideas are copied, bad ideas are imposed"

4587 2018-05-26 20:41:43 What I didn't want is a Ronaldo last goal. He would have celebrated than the person who discovered oil in Nigeria
4588 2018-05-26 20:41:40 Nice, it's ashame that we do not see too many female mechanics. If there was, I would bring my vehicle more often for an oil lube & filter.
4589 2018-05-26 20:41:36 Well Bret you finally convinced me you are an idiot. Elon, Tesla et al will succeed as Apple arose from its ashes in the 90s. Oil prices have just doubled in 18 months.  US companies still focussed on petrol SUVs.  Production fixes for Tesla will come when market most needs.
4590 2018-05-26 20:41:31 Ororo no be crude oil

4591 2018-05-26 20:41:28 Oil pastels for me, but I enjoy acrylic paints too.

4593 2018-05-26 20:41:16 Might be a little late streaming tonight. Routine oil change is now routine repair....
4594 2018-05-26 20:41:11 Oil is vital to our national infrastructure. Being able to produce and and refine our own petroleum products is vital to our national defense. Think about that this #MemorialDayWeekend2018
4595 2018-05-26 20:41:10 I dunno m8 they were on the road to secularization until the Cold War powers decided to dip their dicks into the oil wells.

4597 2018-05-26 20:41:04 Ok you are speaking my language girl! Is it the cleansing cream or is it an actual oil? I looked at this. Can you send me a pic?
4598 2018-05-26 20:41:04 Jab crud oil ke price kam the tab kaun sa modi ji ne petrol price kam kr diye the...
4599 2018-05-26 20:41:00 Our oil is an American product with international market constraints.
4600 2018-05-26 20:40:55 I think it had a big part in Dallas' "new" image, although the show debuted in '78 and took a couple of years to get going. The Cowboys had been winners for a decade by then and won two Super Bowls. The oil business boomed and the TV show reflected a lot of what was going on.
4601 2018-05-26 20:40:24 Omg, you guys...just had to google "how to get olive oil off a cat."
4602 2018-05-26 20:40:23 レアルおめでとう！！
4603 2018-05-26 20:40:21 Kansas and sadly, Cinderella... yes. Midnight Oil is not classic rock and also a bore.
4604 2018-05-26 20:40:13 I think I was made for Venice. All the coffee drinks have CBD oil & lavender in them. & as long as I wear a little makeup, wearing natural hair is normal.
4605 2018-05-26 20:40:11 We don’t need to rely on any other country for oil; Period...

4634 2018-05-26 20:35:24 You're really going to blame Democrats for the higher gas prices at the pumps? Oil was down $2.83 per barrel yesterday. Pump price not down even 1 penny. When it's the other way and a Barrel is up $2.83 prices at the pump up 5 cents. Do something about that!

4639 2018-05-26 20:34:12 I know if you go west things gets pretty scarily right wing in Canada too, and Trudeau is cool and all, but way too oil-exploitation oriented.  Good for economy, I'm sure, but still.  That's some real dirty oil.
4640 2018-05-26 20:34:02 Indonesia, Egypt, and Mexico subsidize their oil industries to control inflation. The rise of the oil price increases the prices of goods. But the Philippines wants to be idiotically unique. It plans to heavily tax petroleum products. So brace yourself for more inflation.
4641 2018-05-26 20:33:50 Guys. GUYS. I started a conversation w this lady while we were waiting to get our oil changed, long story short, we’re going to church together tomorrow & she paid for my oil change. Nice people are everywhere seriously.

4651 2018-05-26 20:32:34 I'm curious as too how many of you have had no luck with CBD oil. I'm finding that nothing I've tried that's "pure" CBD has had any effect on pain or anxiety, and anything with a little THC in it gets me high in a way that I don't like. Would love to hear how others have fared.

4659 2018-05-26 20:31:03 Salafi Islamic fanaticism is a real problem- no doubt. But you oversimplify. Wrong priorities like financing Jihadi groups against secular Syria to protect oil/ golan heigts led to IS - Syria became a magnet for all sick people. The real Salafi fanatics are stronger now.

4690 2018-05-26 20:27:04 The odd case of Antartica. Nobody ever completely crossed Antartica by foot, car or airplane.

4695 2018-05-26 20:25:30 All fish are not the same. To think that a piranha is the same as a guppy is crazy. To think that CBD from industrial hemp is the same as cannabis/pot which gets you high is just as crazy. I have been so thrilled to see the positive effects that CBD oil has had on my body.

4758 2018-05-26 20:15:25 The world may be changing but demand for oil and gas continues to grow and grow. Why do you say the policy includes support for wind and solar? Also, wind and solar generate electricity - so are by no means a full replacement for the many uses of oil and gas.
4759 2018-05-26 20:15:21 Liza, this is a service needed due to mileage and will be taken care of by the branch upon return. It is most likely an oil change. If you are worried about driving the vehicle you can contact your branch and they would let you know about swapping or how to take in for repair. CM
4760 2018-05-26 20:15:13 Americans are brainwashed to think that they defeated ISIS in 2017. No you didn’t: the Syrian army and her allies (Hezbollah, Iran and Russia) did. The US just gave ISIS eastern territories to the Kurds to keep the oil...

4793 2018-05-26 20:08:51 Yep. I use to see ALL flavours going through BP Oil UK depot next to the refinery at Grangemouth.
Now its Ineos I suppose its a bit more OK.
4794 2018-05-26 20:08:37 trying to find the moment where im drunk but not drunk enough to injure mysekf while cooking using knife and oil
4795 2018-05-26 20:08:34 Is it coincidental that the US relationship with the Saudis has become much closer during the Trump presidency and the price of oil is steadily climbing?
4796 2018-05-26 20:08:31 oof true and with french fries, you fry them in VEGETABLE oil so i mean i’m one healthy bitch

4813 2018-05-26 20:05:55 Hmmm, are #Alaska’s Legislators @lisamurkowski @SenDanSullivan and @repdonyoung trading people for oil drilling legislation and whatever other things they want like right wing judges?

4845 2018-05-26 20:01:43 Already deleted him. Life is much better already. If only we didn't have to give up all tax breaks, and end up giving it all to the Saudi's. OPEC mysteriously goes high, for entitled Republican's who work angles always making oil companies filthy rich. No excuses needed, takers!!
4846 2018-05-26 20:01:31 If you want progressivism/socialism/communism check out Venezuela. An oil rich country where the people (government) controls everything, and the people are starving. If that is what you want, then go there.

4857 2018-05-26 20:00:12 Yeah...and eucalyptus oil can cause seziures.

4871 2018-05-26 19:58:01 Just as the Saudis announced they would be breaking with OPECs oil producing limit that artificially raises the price at the pump. Can you say price manipulation.
4872 2018-05-26 19:57:31 That's what you think. Haha brother look this guys careless about you take it or enjoy it. Remember there is a $25b  NNPC contract allegation and guess who's the oil minister, plus the N1.8tr oil subsidy payment even when there are claims that subsidy has been removed.

4918 2018-05-26 19:50:12 Yeah just have to make sure you keep oil in your car.. but it’s def way too hot for that
4919 2018-05-26 19:50:06 Why is gas so high?
Mister great. What happen to America oil?
4920 2018-05-26 19:49:59 Oh shit, there’s 5?!
4921 2018-05-26 19:49:43 With a $27,000,000,000 clean up bill for the toxic waste of the oil sands Alberta will be getting equalization payments from the rest of Canada first least 5 generations. Quit ur bitumen abt equalization and clean up your own mess.
4922 2018-05-26 19:49:37 olive oil and lemon
4923 2018-05-26 19:49:33 I'm sorry bro. You're wrong. If you're making the comparison of taxation by force on citizens to that of the world paying for oil using US Dollars enforced by the military, then that comparison I can understand, but it's not real value since force is necessary.
4924 2018-05-26 19:49:33 #bcpoli @cknw @bc1 @theroygreenshow  Roy could you explain how we lost 11 billion in oil sales -- when we had no way to get the oil to market in the first place - how can you lose something you never had in the first place - your arguments don't make logical sense
4925 2018-05-26 19:49:25

4929 2018-05-26 19:48:32 *Puts on tinfoil hat*

Yeah, and some media outlets are probably being paid off by giant oil and gas companies (and advertisers) to slow Elon down so they can keep making that dirty fossil fuel cash.

*Takes off tinfoil hat to get serious*

Yeah, it’s fucking annoying.
4930 2018-05-26 19:48:25 My hands currently look about as ladylike as a mechanic's, but I promise that's just melted chocolate under my fingernails and NOT motor oil.
4931 2018-05-26 19:48:17 Bummer, she knows about beard oil right?
4932 2018-05-26 19:48:12 This article is garbage, and you know it.  Tesla was supposed to be the car of the future because we’re running out of oil? What are you talking about?  And subsidies are there to account for an external cost not to make millionaires richer...

4939 2018-05-26 19:47:35 On Petrol and Diesel prices, the center/oil corps should start by providing a detailed bill to consumer with state and central taxes & cesses as separate line items. 
To be followed up with systemic solution to address high prices, like bringing them under GST.

4941 2018-05-26 19:47:16 Please, just shut up and try to do your job. How long will you try to blame your behavior and your mistakes on Hillary, President Obama, and Democrats? You own the oil prices and market fluctuations.
4942 2018-05-26 19:47:02 They played a part in the final already.. Which history won't they be part of...? They are just shedding tears because they could potentially miss the world cup!

4944 2018-05-26 19:46:57 I cannot reach my medically-recommended macronutrient balance even if I shoveled tofu & coconut oil down my throat and nothing else. I've looked (just for the sake of argument) for vegan diets that can get me under 100 carbs, and over 60% protein. So... meat's mandatory.

4947 2018-05-26 19:46:18 The Islamic Republic is also a terrorist cult but state sponsored with a navy and an army and oil revnues. Islamic republic is equally menacing. Iranians despise both of them. Iranian deserve better. #IRGCTerrorists
4948 2018-05-26 19:46:03 You just drown them in oil make an alter and boom you got breakfast
4949 2018-05-26 19:46:01 @theJagmeetSingh your wrong on KM because stopping this pipeline only increases our dependence on US for oil markets at a time when the US could care less about the Canadian interests. This will be your down fall when it comes to votes.

4957 2018-05-26 19:44:36 Prove what that the NZ governments policies won’t make a difference to the environment with regards to Natural gas. Or that there policies around dairy farming and the oil industry will destroy large parts of the economy in provincial New Zealand?

5051 2018-05-26 19:28:59 Delicious, except I think it's even better drizzled w olive oil, sprinkled w kosher salt and fresh ground pepper, tossed onto a hot baking sheet and roasted on 400 until ever so slightly charred.

5060 2018-05-26 19:27:34 Alberta has more than enough refining capacity and already supplies BC, AB, SK and MB - we don't need more refineries, we need pipelines to get the oil and refined fuel to market...i.e. Vancouver.
5061 2018-05-26 19:27:27 Operation get everyone faded off 1 cup of oil ... accomplished
5062 2018-05-26 19:27:18 Oils like this are normally CBD not THC. So there is no high & no impairment. I take CBD oil daily for my back pain (7 herniated thoracic discs from an old injury). Since taking it inflammation way down almost 0 pain. Haven’t needed hydrocodone in months. It works.
5063 2018-05-26 19:26:52 Alberta Advantage = oil in the ground. Price goes up, advantage. Price goes down, sky is falling. I'm tired of that shit.
5064 2018-05-26 19:26:24 Palestine had no weapons during the time the Jews ceased into their lands. Conflicts happened, but either way the Arabs sold out Palestine. Ever since Israel Arab countries being overthrown & destabilizing that don’t give there oil. Welcome to the terror of capitalism.
5065 2018-05-26 19:26:18 The prefect nap does exist. It’s the nap after a long hot beach day when your skin is fried, fresh out of the shower and washed off the sand and tanning oil. You pass out and wake up just in time for dinner and sunset.. yeah that’s the perfect nap
5066 2018-05-26 19:26:14 Hahahaha..... Well! Somethings are unforeseen as the team said. Gearbox inspections were fine. Once they fired up they detected an oil. It doesn't age well but you get my point. The guy has speed. So kindly sod off! Thank you!
5067 2018-05-26 19:25:50 I voted for Oil on the basis that the real reason was "credulously doing whatever the people around him told him to do." and the prominent one was oil. But I think that also covers democratization.

5079 2018-05-26 19:23:31 Hey, @veracruztacos! Am I even close? 

1TBSP  olive oil
1 cup chopped carrots

5080 2018-05-26 19:23:30 lol the oil change itself was a deal then I had whatever other service done.l that I never heard of 
5081 2018-05-26 19:23:09 Yes we do, the corporations make the rules. The tax laws drafted by accountants, the environment by the oil lobby. Have actually read what moog wants from brexit? That’s the only way it makes financial sense, but he wins while millions loose.
5082 2018-05-26 19:22:48 Wish my oil change was $45

5091 2018-05-26 19:21:24 《オリーブ油豆知識》

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
5092 2018-05-26 19:20:56 You can tell summer is about to start, people are bitching about the cost of gas. Hey simpletons, it rises every year at this time, it’s called peak travel season. And no it’s not Trump, just like it wasn’t Obama or any other President. It’s OPEC and the oil companies.
5093 2018-05-26 19:20:48 It's written in Greek. It's written in English. I'm sure the Oil and Gas Commission have contemplated a complete revamp of the work of 1/4
5094 2018-05-26 19:20:38 I’ll bring my Tony Llamas. What freaks.
5095 2018-05-26 19:20:35 PDP should be seeing and not be heard,one of the most corrupted government in history,so u can execute some projects when a barrel of oil was $100 and above,d three basic infrastructures of life were still lacking,Electricity,Refineries,good roads&high unemployment.
5096 2018-05-26 19:20:30 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.
5097 2018-05-26 19:20:25 - try a lip plumper
- use lip oil
- use red lipstick
- over line your pout
- highlight your Cupid’s bow
- use a lip scrub 1-2x a week
5098 2018-05-26 19:20:18 Numbers showed the public held Gov in general in contempt long before Trump. That's why he was elected. 
You still don't get it.
5099 2018-05-26 19:20:03 If you’re having a dryness issue seriously consider using olive oil. omg. my skin is like silk before I even put lotion on.
5100 2018-05-26 19:20:03 Thx,my question isn’t where oil is heading to, nobody really knows,I’m wondering how fast ppl change their mind, I know it’s necessary to change the direction when trading, and that as fast as possible, don’t get married to a trade,same ppl calling for 80 are now in camp 60.
5101 2018-05-26 19:20:00 Maybe they'll blow up some of the oil fields. That would certainly hurt.

5104 2018-05-26 19:19:45 is bio oil the best for reducing scars
5105 2018-05-26 19:19:43 Healthy ingredient & appetite suppressant? Coconut oil.

Hair strengthener & skin moisturizer? Coconut oil.

Crippling debt & manic depression? Coconut oil.

5106 2018-05-26 19:19:43 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
5107 2018-05-26 19:19:36 Pretty much impossible. I was raised in Alberta and understand both sides very well. There's just no denying the impact an oil spill can have. Bc ships out tons of Alberta coal. It's not a climate issue.
5108 2018-05-26 19:19:21 I know you don’t like it, but I think it looks good! It’ll grow out in no time  try oiling your scalp w/ almond oil once or twice a week and massaging it, works wonders

5111 2018-05-26 19:19:14 Thank you love 

My nails generally grow quite long but I was just telling someone it’s helpful to try soaking + scrubbing your nails in olive oil and brown sugar. It will do fantastic things for your nail bed.

Trombone from down the hall: “DID SOMEONE ASK FOR SLIDEEEEE GREASEEEE??????”
5113 2018-05-26 19:18:43 You obviously won’t acknowledge it but you know the debt is a direct result of the massive drop in oil royalty income and former PC’s mismanagement of prior royalty income streams. Years of government waste, & lack of foresight.
5114 2018-05-26 19:18:23 Oregano oil...a natural antibiotic. It works. And a good colloidal silver as well.

5119 2018-05-26 19:17:31 Vitamin E oil has made a drastic difference in my skin after just a few days of using it. I’d recommend everyone to use it in their skin care routine!!
5120 2018-05-26 19:17:16 Garry,
Would you agree that Putin and Saudi raising oil production now is a scam to help Trumpf?
5121 2018-05-26 19:17:03 I’m so sorry for this diagnosis! Hugs to you and your pup. I’m sure a million people have asked, but have you tried golden paste and bone broth? I do both with my guys for quality of life. Maybe look into CBD oil too?

5125 2018-05-26 19:16:52 Chef Skinner cut up some worms, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was some  human flesh, along with Play-Doh.
5126 2018-05-26 19:16:52 Crude oil has fallen by 4 % on Friday why is Govt increasing petrol and diesel prices - you are taking middle class for granted
5127 2018-05-26 19:16:50 I hadn’t seen that. I did know about the gas surplus that opec pushed out in an attempt to drive American oil companies out of business. That led to a dramatic price drop that has finally seemed to come back to normal.

5131 2018-05-26 19:16:36 Kevin uses GERS to pretend Scotland can't afford independence. I'm pointing out that GERS shows Scotland can afford independence. I'm pointing out that Kevin lies and obfuscates. 

As to the future, Norway makes lots from oil: why doesn't Scotland? Don't you think that's odd?
5132 2018-05-26 19:16:31 In 1997, Aleksandr Dugin published “The Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geopolitical Future of Russia.”
The book outlines a program of subversion, destabilization & disinformation by utilizing Russia's gas, oil & natural resources to influence other countries. 
 It's working...

5135 2018-05-26 19:16:07 We sell them more oil than Saudi Arabia. They deployed a half a million men to the desert twice to protect the Saudis. What do you think would happen if Justin turned off the tap?

5143 2018-05-26 19:15:24 Tahini, yoghourt (greek better), garlic, olive oil, bit of lemon juice. Quantities not overly important (50% or more tahini vs yoghourt but 1-1 could be too much, couple tbsp oil, more to taste, 1-2 cloves, more to taste), make it saucy on a blender. Goes with anything

5167 2018-05-26 19:11:32 Also, there are so many ship wrecks filled with oil that are ticking time bombs. Why isn’t there a system to go down, even 1k feet, and drain the oil. If it’s usable, use it. And if it keeps from pumping more oil, great. It’ll keep prices down & put more oil on the market!

5198 2018-05-26 19:06:49 My skin is MF glowing in this sun right now. Praising the highest for grapeseed oil and H2O.
5199 2018-05-26 19:06:47 Also - The US is not the freest economy in the world. In fact Denmark is ranked like 6 places higher in economic freedom than the US, which is part of the reason the Scandinavian countries are so rich (plus they produce oil and weapons)
5200 2018-05-26 19:06:42 Bahot bada kam kiya ye logon ne.. Kal se ye sab log car main dirct cruide oil use karenge.. They are not shouting just biasing and showing concern about fuel hike.
5201 2018-05-26 19:06:37 Our President, should be ashamed of what he's doing for many reasons..  The price of crude oil is down, we haven't had any storms or natural disasters yet the price of petro keeps climbing!  Stop worrying about the NFL's business and work on fuel prices and the economy.  waytogo.

5205 2018-05-26 19:05:59 What you're seeing is actually a mixture of oil and crumbs that can sometimes form during packaging and it is not peanut based. Please DM us the UPC, expiration date with the letters & numbers that follow.
5206 2018-05-26 19:05:51 The Clintons stole a small oil painting, a bust of Lincoln, a historic doorknob...and completely thtashed the WH. Left obscene messages on the recordings, broje furniture, unplugged the fridge so the meat spoiled...
5207 2018-05-26 19:05:37 Ya I re-read your tweet wrong. The 72 to 74 is a T target. Which is still live. Depending how many are long OIL will shake the tree. It does whatever it wants to do. However the move is still within sync. I just made a video on it. Watch the video being posted shortly. Cheers Arm

5210 2018-05-26 19:04:58 Did Donald Trump ever start a company to launch rockets into space? Did Donald come up with a plan to ditch the oil age?  Is Donald trying to make humanity great for the 1st time ever? #Type1Civilization

5213 2018-05-26 19:04:48 That incentive depends on YOU appreciating what they have done...oil fields and money are tangible, can be invested, can yield REAL returns, can be shared as company bonus, can pay rent, energy bill, etc....you get the gist ma?

5216 2018-05-26 19:04:21 i don’t have fear of washing my hair with tea tree oil shampoo anymore like i know it strips dye pretty bad but my hair is so absolutely full of red dye it would take a miracle to get this shit out i’ve been dyeing it for like 3 years

Harley's face paled as she spoke, realising this really was NOT a glamorous introduction. Rather than focusing too ~
5218 2018-05-26 19:04:17 the department of education, cutting protections on the environment so his oil buddies prosper, pals around with Russians , congratulates dictators and nazis and white supremists. Hates Americans while saying #maga. I have more......
5219 2018-05-26 19:04:09 Best part is him questioning how many drops of oil used to lubricate machinery. Resulted in major savings by half number of drops

5221 2018-05-26 19:04:02 Does Scotland have any oil?
5222 2018-05-26 19:03:58 Salad cream is a creamy, pale yellow condiment based on an emulsion of about 25–50 percent oil in water, emulsified by egg yolk and acidulated by spirit vinegar. It may include other ingredients such as sugar, mustard, salt, thickener, spices, flavouring and colouring.
5223 2018-05-26 19:03:53 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.

5226 2018-05-26 19:03:39 Congrats #Ireland on repealing #abortionban. Meanwhile in America, we will be turning back the hands of time where rape victims are forced to have babies they don't want. On a different note, we will start taking a hard look at whale oil again for fuel. 
5227 2018-05-26 19:03:27 olip oil tdr woy
5228 2018-05-26 19:03:20 And this is surprising?
Somebody has to go fight, and possibly die, for that gallon of gas, motor oil, Don Jr.'s hair grease.
Pretty smart really, you might forfeit your life but the benefits can be great.
War, it's  a machine of wealth, the hell with the dead bodies.
5229 2018-05-26 19:02:49 This is an article written with the perspective and bias of a oil ceo. History will prove Elon right.

5234 2018-05-26 19:02:03 Anywhere actually. Got mine at iponri. But my oud oil was a gift.
5235 2018-05-26 19:01:30 I find that insensitive and demanding. Also you didn't actually say a thing. Just more mumbo jumbo, I'm King so do what I dam well say or else what? What Mr. POMPEO will you do, perhaps declare a war. Trump & Kochs want a war with Iran, they said so. Oil $ I suppose. Need more $.
5236 2018-05-26 19:01:29 Israel is the only Democracy it the Middle East, where women have equal rights, and freedom is protected. They also aren't lazy, because the don't have oil money, so they must innovate.

5253 2018-05-26 18:59:43 This guy at the oil change shop is talking to me about his black friends... he said they love to gamble, drink Hennessy, & Patron. This is so awkward....
5254 2018-05-26 18:59:37 Oh, that’s intriguing! Mine is all yolks and oil, but similar ratios overall.

5256 2018-05-26 18:59:35 That night the winter fell hard, fires cracked and the men met hunger. Just a few more nights and we will be in Armadram. Wild boar though sparse fed us and provided oil for the cold steel that will soon taste revenge. Until then we hold the clan tight to our breast.

5262 2018-05-26 18:58:42 Well I’m not in his shoes but if you read the article it wasn’t about the cannabis oil it was the fact that he was epileptic and I do agree with the medical staff for the decision.

5269 2018-05-26 18:57:29 .@Noble_Jim reports that Ryan Reed has returned to the race after the team replaced a broken oil cooler that led to him getting into the wall earlier.
5270 2018-05-26 18:57:27 I heard fish oil was healthy for ya.  I didn't expect THAT kind of response, but tbh I probably should have with you.
5271 2018-05-26 18:57:01 Oil. I think my weight conversions might be out.

Seems that d intolerance is among d political class more than people. But still opposition shouldn't be underestimated
5277 2018-05-26 18:56:37 Whip game proper! Getting the Subby laced! New brakes, new axels,new tie rods, new tires, oil change new air filter and fixed radiator! That's the business. Good looking out Edward Donne.
5278 2018-05-26 18:56:26 Oil pattern No. X
5279 2018-05-26 18:56:17 This is the point we're at in this loose confederation called a country. Something as routine as a pipeline has become a political football because foreign money wants it to be difficult--if not impossible to ship AB oil.

5281 2018-05-26 18:56:04 Mostly due to the higher gas prices on the commodities exchange. Got higher the moment Trump pulled out of the Iran deal. The market grew scared of sparseness of oil supplies in the world.

My biological dad bullshit..my stepdad handle everything
5294 2018-05-26 18:52:42 I like to eat them with fish sauce and rice, or with sesame oil on noodles. Goes well with tender protein like chicken or tofu!

5308 2018-05-26 18:49:45 I always put it down to the analogy of "What would you prefer hanging on your wall. A photo of a landscape, or an oil painting of it?"
5309 2018-05-26 18:49:28 And the brilliance award of the day goes to the guy who tries to say it won’t hurt putting wrong oil in a 2 cycle engine.
5310 2018-05-26 18:49:24 Yup i always knew it was bad. I like to use virgin coconut oil tho.. then i rinse it off with water. or sometimes i just put it on after i wash my veejayjay.. Heee.
5311 2018-05-26 18:49:17 It was an irony, (oil to the fire), teasing, to indicate how extreme it sounds that just because #UK decided to leave #EU and the latter wants to take care of its own well being, then #US is walking away from European security, which is also US security (Transatlantic an all)

5321 2018-05-26 18:47:48 Could care less about big oil or big tobacco. I care about intrinsic value, building wealth for my family. All else is irrelevant as it relates to this discussion.

5323 2018-05-26 18:47:42 Do you have any idea about how much oil each wind turbine uses as lubricant?  Keep em coming. We still aren’t getting away from fossil fuels anytime soon. Again no viable green option means we need to utilize our resource. Pipelines are the best way to move that product. Build KM

5348 2018-05-26 18:44:13 How valuable to be armed  knowledge that oil was carving out a time/price square-out at this weeks highs? how profitable having that one tool in your quiver could have been in both selling oil longs and reversing short: inquiries re my Sq of 9 Wheel jeffreycooper@earthlink.net

5358 2018-05-26 18:43:13 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

5364 2018-05-26 18:42:32 Ah. A friend works in oil exploration. Thousands of staff displaced and moved to safety I believe. Been planning for this for a few days.
5365 2018-05-26 18:42:29 about to try this honey castor oil hair mask.
5366 2018-05-26 18:42:19 I put mine in the oven with some oil. It does an okay job.
5367 2018-05-26 18:42:05 Golan Heights is Syrian soil rightfully and legally via the rules of international law. Because Golan Heights is rich in oil and banks want full control. Notice he doesn't give a good reason as to why... be a free thinker

5370 2018-05-26 18:41:46 Clove oil is your friend, particularly in the bathroom (disinfect, slaughters mold, and deodorizes!).  Also, vinegar and baking soda are the best team since the Superfriends.  Add in a bit of orange oil for woods if'n you got any (also repels bugs!).  (Dilute both oils!)
5371 2018-05-26 18:41:39 Yo that oil change just ruined my whole day
5372 2018-05-26 18:41:35 You've waited over an hour past your appt time?! Wow sis, you need to stand up for yourself by walking out.

Call back on Tues & talk to the manager & post your displeasure on their SM accts. If that doesn't get you a discount or free oil change call the owner/district manager
5373 2018-05-26 18:41:34 See what sports and entertainment is bringing to Europe and other parts of the developed world. We are here focusing on oil revenue alone and the myth that the  more population the more revenue the regions get. @ChampionsLeague

5375 2018-05-26 18:41:27 Oil is falling in price but big oil is screwing the customers. Will the CPC bring in price control? NO. What will the CPC do to make gasoline under a dollar/L? #cdnpoli #onpoli #bcpoli #abpoli #ableg #VanPoli #topoli
5376 2018-05-26 18:41:26 oh now all of a sudden #US is abandoning Europe too? Where is it going? #Junker was wise mentioning to Putin a #pan-European security (oil to the fire here).
5377 2018-05-26 18:41:25 Kinder Morgan is an energy infrastructure company, not an oil company. #buildkm
5378 2018-05-26 18:41:22 No signs at all! It didn’t dump a whole ton of oil, but it wasn’t a small amount. I got the car back after two or three days. All good now!
5379 2018-05-26 18:41:20 should be distance themselves from Nazis and oil wrestling
5380 2018-05-26 18:41:19 The trick to perfect roasted vegetables is to use less olive oil before roasting. (and high heat).  Otherwise they just mainly steam
5381 2018-05-26 18:41:15 If I say I want an oil change don’t come back over here asking if I want anything else...like idk what you’re even talking about lol

Even one was asking if inada hankali fr replying a quoted tweet she was in.
5388 2018-05-26 18:40:29 People have obligations that require driving and the oil companies know it and keep getting richer.
5389 2018-05-26 18:40:27 @MSFATTY I didn’t forget about your oil. I haven’t been driving that’s why I gave g brought it to you yet.

5396 2018-05-26 18:39:05 Oil was discovered in Nigeria in 1956 at Oloibiri in the Niger Delta after half a century
5397 2018-05-26 18:39:04 I don’t expect to convince you to cover your short position either (assuming you have one).  Big Oil is following the same playbook that Bit Tobacco used when the scientific consensus was hurting their business.
5398 2018-05-26 18:38:56 Me an hour ago: I'll grab my book and notebook so I can read or write while waiting for my oil change.

Guess what I don't have with me.

5402 2018-05-26 18:38:26 Hemp oil in Canada made by crushing the seeds is nutritious packed with EFAs and protein there is NO CBD in It. In Canada CBD for sale from ACMPR only don’t believe the lady at the farmers market selling hemp oil as it contains Cannibidiol
5403 2018-05-26 18:38:25 My jar of coconut oil is now in liquid form. Summer is here.
5404 2018-05-26 18:38:23 The gas price increase is by design.

Russia’s number one export is oil. With the Iran nuke agreement, the US lessened long-standing sanctions on Iranian oil. When the US left that agreement, oil sources got restricted and prices went up. That was to help Russia
5405 2018-05-26 18:38:22 ต้องบ่นนน
5406 2018-05-26 18:38:12 Told to you by oil billionaires wanting to keep their bought politicians.
5407 2018-05-26 18:37:42 C-Bag is slimier than a BP oil spill. If he’s a friend of yours, you should be very careful.
5408 2018-05-26 18:37:29 Finally doing an oil change when I should have done it in September
5409 2018-05-26 18:37:27 And this risk... is all about selling oil to Asia... half way across the planet, when they have their only customer, their best customer right across the border from Alberta! Land locked oil my ass!
5410 2018-05-26 18:37:23 If you get near Gertsburg let me know. We can go ghosting. I don't do haunted ghost walks. Too much like snake oil salesmen.

5416 2018-05-26 18:36:53 My personal recommendation would be a Yamaha or Mercury 5hp (Basically the same). They're very reliable as long as the engine and drive oil is checked and changed regularly. Should a problem arise, parts are plentiful and readily available.

5420 2018-05-26 18:36:22 Cannabis oil usually has no THC in it. It's not really for getting high; it's like a magical substance that can be ingested or used topically to treat pain, anxiety, epilepsy, and then the famous case of Rick Simpson who cured his skin cancer with homemade oil.
5421 2018-05-26 18:36:08 @realDonaldTrump Why are we buying foreign oil? Your tax break isn't enough if gas prices are going up. Stop supporting foreign oil. We have plenty here in America.

5425 2018-05-26 18:36:04 Bake chicken breasts in Italian bread crumbs. Nearly impossible to turn dry & delish. Also, cutting up your veg, throwing it on a pan to roast with oil and herbs and spices, cooking your meat on it at the same time is life changing. Not a parent just really fucking lazy.
5426 2018-05-26 18:35:48 And what to use instead of sugar and salt and oil? Please recommend.
5427 2018-05-26 18:35:44 Its getting crazy ... furnace oil is almost a dollar a litre now ... This needs to be stopped.

5434 2018-05-26 18:35:07 NPV comparisons have their limitations. It works well when comparing, say, Deep Water to Deep Water. Oil Sands have 30 to 40 years flat production and so all PV comparisons are relatively meaningless.

5451 2018-05-26 18:33:24 Media stunt and you bought all of it. Reformer?  That place hasn’t reformed in thousand of years, they’re just richer because the oil funds are under the care of western financial managers.
5452 2018-05-26 18:33:23 Changing my oil in this brz is 1,000,000 times easier than every other car I've owned
5453 2018-05-26 18:33:20 Why the hell are we still dependent on foreign oil. We have more than enough to supply our country. Bring those freakin' gas prices down. NOW!

5467 2018-05-26 18:31:42 How anyone could vote for you when you represent  the collapse of the Western economy and Canada's ability to sell and use our own oil, is shameful. You are #anti-Canadian #ontpoli

5480 2018-05-26 18:29:55 Those tweets were succinct about a 10year investigation (half way charges were brought on Russians living in Trump Tower) that focused around Manafort’s world, Trump Tower and pro-Putin oil oligarch’s money-laundering. In 3 tweets.

5487 2018-05-26 18:29:01 Congratulations!!!! 
5488 2018-05-26 18:29:00 Dude looks constipated everytime he meets an African leader but comes to life when he meets a Qatari, Saudi, Kenyan and Norwegian oil explores.
5489 2018-05-26 18:28:52 Getting an oil change and a tire rotation and I forgot to get my goddamn apartment keys off the chain before I turned them over.
Someone hang with me since I’m a fucking stupid
5490 2018-05-26 18:28:48 It is. Slowly. The mainstream is starting to go impact which is the right way round! Some better than others obviously but the oil tanker is beginning to shift. Seminal times me thinks......hopes!
5491 2018-05-26 18:28:47 I've gone through the list, and some of the items are tenuous at best. But I fundamental disagree with most of them, e.g. take climate change is undisputed by everyone including oil companies. It's happening, we are damaging the future for profit.
5492 2018-05-26 18:28:40 Ha ha ha ha  you are wrong, we are going somewhere, just think deeply, we are going somewhere, we are nose diving and we will soon discover oil kkkkk lol
5493 2018-05-26 18:28:36 Yeah, but we cant discredit the beautiful oil slick  they're both beautiful 

My 2 moods.

I'm innocent & blushy, or I wanna drown someone in oil and walk around with a memento 
5494 2018-05-26 18:28:30 Oil at $75 a barrel on 5000bopd is $8.25m revenue a month for our share
5495 2018-05-26 18:28:25 DLM if Scotland wishes to go then I suspect most would say OK.  Don't rely on oil figures,they are at best useless in the future. Banking is shot to bits,always big in Scotland. Government contracts will go south. So you need investment  to grow,where will that come from?
5496 2018-05-26 18:28:24 All I had to hand was an antiseptic wash and some battles maggot oil
5497 2018-05-26 18:28:17 Coconut oil is a game changer best moisturiser out there 
5498 2018-05-26 18:28:08 went skating for a bit this morning. i missed it so much  need to get some street oil wheels tho.
5499 2018-05-26 18:27:59 Ang effective nung Master Facial Scrub Oil Control haha
5500 2018-05-26 18:27:49 Ye sometimes the mask is overkill for non-chemically treated hair, but adding a bit of oil (coconut oil is just the cheapest option, other hair oils can be less extreme but are more expensive, like argon oil) can help dealing with frizz on dry hair acutely.
5501 2018-05-26 18:27:47 חכי שישמעו שיש להקה שנקראת midnight oil
5502 2018-05-26 18:27:38 My skin decided to be hella dry today but got that baby oil 
5503 2018-05-26 18:27:35 You can't un-discover what's been discovered. You just have to deal with what you have. Make guns illegal the price goes up, criminals work harder for them for they are tools of their trade. And honest people become easier targets. Would you attack someone who might be armed?
5504 2018-05-26 18:27:18 “Is it crystal clear or look like Lake Eerie...Michigan..?!” Man next to me getting his oil changed.
5505 2018-05-26 18:27:13 Someone come through with an oil change for my car please
5506 2018-05-26 18:27:12 Norway has huge oil reserves and drilling economy. But they have done good PR on green economy
5507 2018-05-26 18:26:58 These niggas as nissan take like 3 hours for a fucking oil change
5508 2018-05-26 18:26:32 Add coconut oil and it’s brand new
5509 2018-05-26 18:26:31 WHY ARE FISH OIL PILLS SO FUCKING HUGE JESUS H. CHRIST
5510 2018-05-26 18:26:12 How dumb public can be? They can argue on justifying the price hike of crude oil without even thinking once about the millions of spending on different political rallies and campaign. "Mamu ye bhi apna hi paisa hai iran debt to bas bahana hai" Think wisely.
5511 2018-05-26 18:26:01 I tried to be cheap w my oil change the man called me like yea so your car takes synthetic oil I said so what does that mean? Is that good or bad he said depends on how you look at it  good cause it’s better oil bad cause it’s $20 more I was like oh my fucking God 
5512 2018-05-26 18:25:42 * pours coconut oil over entire life*
5513 2018-05-26 18:25:33 I don’t use lotion when it’s hot so i use baby oil to oil my feet and legs
5514 2018-05-26 18:25:28 Thanks for the tip! I might try a tiny tiny amount of coconut oil. Because a while ago I messed up the oil production of my hair from doing coconut oil hair masks.

5517 2018-05-26 18:24:59 I changed the oil in my lawnmower, cleared all the excess grass from underneath, changed the blade and the air filter, and filled her up with gas! We’re good to go now! #ThingsMyDadTaughtMe #YesIPulledTheSparkPlug
5518 2018-05-26 18:24:59 Voicemail from "The Master Prophet." He's sorry to have missed me, but would like to send some of his "special anointing oil." #hardpass #blocked
5519 2018-05-26 18:24:52 We don’t believe it’s a coincidence that Trump’s actions against Iran & Venezuela have driven up oil prices, helping Putin/Russia tremendously.
5520 2018-05-26 18:24:49 Engine oil 
5521 2018-05-26 18:24:46 Or, we could act like rational consumers and find alternatives to our oil dependency.

But that wouldn't play well with your donors, would it? Best to pretend it's not even an option, right?
5522 2018-05-26 18:24:46 @FoxBusiness how come everytime the American people start to have a little extra $$ in their pockets...gas prices rise and big oil takes our money?
5523 2018-05-26 18:24:44 Well in Canada, where oil is plentiful it is around $5.20 qt.  Thanks Saudi & Trump!!
5524 2018-05-26 18:24:35 Speedy recovery bang buat mika
5525 2018-05-26 18:24:17 Do we really need to do this just because they nationalized the oil industry. George GSUS Bush and company toppled their government because of that. I mean wow the free heating oil to the NE USA deserved that response?
5526 2018-05-26 18:24:14 I've used the mantle, Anointing oil and Blood of sprinkling @TLizzyly 
5527 2018-05-26 18:23:56 The perfect thing for soaking up oil spills.
5528 2018-05-26 18:23:48 อีบ้าาาาาละมีการดูจริงๆ ด้วยว่าสีอะไร
5529 2018-05-26 18:23:43 Oh and acrylic is the best way to go. Stay away from oil Lmaoo
5530 2018-05-26 18:23:36 Want to see political repression go to Saudi Arabia and say the shiah areas that have oil reserves should no longer be oppressed. See how far you get before the might of both a fascistic and US client state smashes down on you.
5531 2018-05-26 18:23:32 Bro i did my last oil change and i didn’t have the right tool to pop the filter off not to mention that shit was difficult to get to 
5532 2018-05-26 18:23:31 2/..and voters won't give a shit; and, 2. Trumpf has Saudi and Russia increasing oil production until election day so gas prices will fall again.
Bottom line: total political ineptitude by Dems will turn country over, for good, to fascism this November.
5533 2018-05-26 18:23:07 You be oil?
5534 2018-05-26 18:23:02 Please, first of all somebody finds oil at an explorative well.
5535 2018-05-26 18:22:49 This is an oil cleanser and is the most amazing cleanser I've ever used. It dissolves makeup in seconds and leaves my skin super hydrated. You won't regret buying it 
5536 2018-05-26 18:22:11 Yes John coconut oil is oil based
5537 2018-05-26 18:22:08 And seems like Syria and Iran might be Trump's mess ... Where is all this heading though?! This maniacal pursuit of oil and 'messianic' hegemony is going to continue to create some serious problems ... Who do those people think they are?!
5538 2018-05-26 18:22:05 มาดึก กลับเช้า มันเป็นยังไง 555 รีบมากเลยหรออ 555
5539 2018-05-26 18:22:04 Hot and spicy cookin oil lol that’s scary
5540 2018-05-26 18:21:46 As an engineer I used to respect individuals such as Elon Musk, however, his recent parallel to “Trump philosophy “ to denigrate any opposition or try to deny proven facts just to prevent embarrassment now makes him less of an engineer and more of a snake oil salesman
5541 2018-05-26 18:21:45 Got oil changed, ended up eating chicken and okra w/ @JaydenMcDaniel and then talked kara into gettin ears pierced. Boyyy  an odd day.
5542 2018-05-26 18:21:36 Last Wed' I was trying 2 buy engine oil went 2 HB asked 4 help
The man said he's new, took me 4 a walk 2 a shelf, wasn't there
Asked another 1a woman, she said yes infront of u & pointed far a way, no aisle numbers.
Wasn't there.
Asked a 3rd man who said I think we don't do that.
5543 2018-05-26 18:21:35 you have the same shaky relationship with honesty that the snake oil salesman currently in the WH has. as you obviously lack critical thinking skill, i'm calling you a liar too. most Americans see through your lack of morals and love of $$
5544 2018-05-26 18:21:15 Water! And I moisturize w/ Vit E oil.
5545 2018-05-26 18:21:14 Your skin smells like jasmine joy, honey bush tea and mint seed oil 
5546 2018-05-26 18:20:57 It would really help if the pipeline companies would stop leaking oil making it necessary to shutdown the lines.
5547 2018-05-26 18:20:56 Putting some coconut oil in your hair as either a mask before washing or a tiny bit as a treatment into dry hair after washing can really help with frizz
5548 2018-05-26 18:20:50 HAHAHA OMG. I watched it and died, watched again and realized “is it oil?” WAS ME.
5549 2018-05-26 18:20:36 Defiantly. I like to look feminine while changing the oil on my car.
5550 2018-05-26 18:20:36 #MemorialDayWeekend2018 and gas prices are through the roof. Maybe there isn't enough oil in American soil to satisfy the fulfillment of American's spoil. People are gonna drive and they know it.
5551 2018-05-26 18:20:32 If life doesn’t work out. I wanna be a coconut farmer and make coconut oil. 
5552 2018-05-26 18:20:31 You think so??? This is fifth day hair! Thanks! I make sure that my hair is deep conditioned before I do wash and goes. I use water mixed with lavender oil, spray that all over my hair, I use castor, the Cantu leave in Conditioner, and homemade flaxseed gel

5556 2018-05-26 18:20:11 Coconut oil and apple cider vinegar will become your new best friends!
5557 2018-05-26 18:20:07 Finally getting my oil changed 
5558 2018-05-26 18:20:00 Dear @AndrewScheer,
Maybe you should study up on the effect of fluctuating world oil prices. That's what has the greatest effect on #gasprices, not the (minimal) federal #carbontax which, in any case, doesn't affect any province with its own measures: eg, BC, ON, QC.
#cdnpoli
5559 2018-05-26 18:19:52 any update on your blog??
5560 2018-05-26 18:19:48 Ha, one step nearer for GOGAS to start drilling for oil.
5561 2018-05-26 18:19:19 I wish I was ancient royalty sometimes just to have servants give me a bath in a tub filled with perfumes and lemons and then rub oil all over me whilst being fanned with giant palm leaves. 

But nah I gotta go stand in my shower now and scrub myself.
5562 2018-05-26 18:19:15 Oh it’s just real Oreos dipped usually in like pancake batter and flash fried. (So like for 20 seconds in like 600 degree oil)
5563 2018-05-26 18:19:08 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
5564 2018-05-26 18:19:08 Lot better than if it were oil, still sucks tho... but the particulates will sink
5565 2018-05-26 18:18:59 They make it up to the people of Iraq whose lives you and Ure stupid country destroyed...stop this shit u do for oil ...
5566 2018-05-26 18:18:49 @wyliedufresne Had a couple of attempts at the fried mayonnaise. Both times it split despite adding the oil slowly. Any tips?
5567 2018-05-26 18:18:43 The singer got caught beating multiple woman n his voice sounds like an angry redneck that drinks car engine oil w his bowl of off brand captain crunch and PBR in the AM
5568 2018-05-26 18:18:31 Thank you for the shout out, Mike. I'm honored to be mentioned among these amazing people.
5569 2018-05-26 18:18:29 *in the middle of oil change*

General, another tire needs inflation. I'll mark it on your map.
5570 2018-05-26 18:18:25 Or sending an 18 year old to die in an oil war. How did you spell Hipocrate?
5571 2018-05-26 18:17:47 Gold mines are not oil wells. They can't just be shut off. Gold mining stocks are at 25-30 year lows. They were making more money at $300 gold than $1300 gold today. Normally a market finds a new equilibrium before an industry falls off a cliff. & the gold industry did until now.
5572 2018-05-26 18:17:46 if she dont got oil splatter scars she not a wife 
5573 2018-05-26 18:17:42 Please don’t take your vehicle to @Walmart to get your Oil changed. They don’t even check Brakes but managed to mess mine up. Went in for an Oil change & came out with NO Brakes. I will take legal Action.
5574 2018-05-26 18:17:41 North American oil capex competes across essentially three buckets, 1) shale/light tight oil, 2) deep water, 3) oil sands. Cost of supply curves are too simplistic to account for competing investment decisions between them.

5581 2018-05-26 18:17:16 Justo lo estaba escuchando y me preguntaba por qué en ese programa permitían que alguien con posiciones tan “pro oil” se presentara como un experto en energía renovable. Esas disonancias son las que arruinan el trabajo de educación que muchos hacen
5582 2018-05-26 18:17:16 He concludes that basically electric cars are snake oil and gas is more efficient, therefore Tesla is a scam. He even namedrops Solyndra. 
5583 2018-05-26 18:17:12 Bruh remember the dude who burned all his packers gear in a fucking oil drum as if anybody would actually give a fuck? If we got at least half the team kneeling for every PRESEASON game the penalties wouldn’t really matter all that much. Small sacrifice to pay to start a wave
5584 2018-05-26 18:17:10 Alex Jones should have given more for all that he has made selling snake oil and off the rail comments - just shows AJ is cheap

People will have less discretionary income.
5592 2018-05-26 18:16:22 I’m like oh okay  but the dude gave me a free voucher for a oil change after 3,000 miles so I didn’t go back in
5593 2018-05-26 18:16:21 So instead they spend all their money on beard oil, tattoos and vagazzles.
5594 2018-05-26 18:16:19 इसमें corruption कहां हो गया है ? और क्या ग़लत हुआ है यह भी बता दें  crude oil का दाम गिरे तो सरकार ने कम नहीं किया तो बढ़ाया भी नहीं , दिक्कत क्या है  2012  मई में  एक ही दिन में कांग्रेस ने 8 रूपए बढ़ाए थे उस समय आप कहां थी ,?
5595 2018-05-26 18:16:19 The reason we seem "fanatical" about those things is because they are relentless smears.

She doesn't support Putin, she simply believes in diplomacy.

Her investments are in mutual funds, like the vanguard 500. Not oil companies.
5596 2018-05-26 18:16:11 Ningun contrato de exploracion se hace de noche a la mañana.

5601 2018-05-26 18:15:30 Yemen oil company.
5602 2018-05-26 18:15:30 That could be part of the reason Schumer publicly blamed Trump for higher gas prices because of Iran deal. We rarely, if ever, by oil from Iran. Schumer full of crap.

5605 2018-05-26 18:15:09 This seems rather odd. We knew that Saudi has hated Yemeni children, but we thought Saudi loved oil.
5606 2018-05-26 18:14:56 After that we did the same for Big Oil (Standard Oil), then the same for telecommunications (AT&T).
5607 2018-05-26 18:14:47 oil changed,car washed and vacuumed...now to the nail shop!
5608 2018-05-26 18:14:42 Have a couple hundred more years of oil remaining, and oil is energy dense, it’s the best thing we have now. Maybe one day solar, nuclear or etc will be better
5609 2018-05-26 18:14:28 Growing up... 
I remember at one point in time using cooking oil as my body lotion but God turned the tables around!!
, what compromises u ha to make cause there was financial difficulties?

5612 2018-05-26 18:13:51 They have 6 other days of the week to protest. They just now can't do it while on company time. Seems logical but we all know Bob and logic are like oil and water.
5613 2018-05-26 18:13:42 i was sad sitting at my oil change appt alone and then this angel of a human offered me coffee and told me there’s donuts and now i couldn’t be happier to be alive

5617 2018-05-26 18:13:13 Huh. No pls. Too much oil is bad.

5628 2018-05-26 18:11:59 Hah please do, she’s been “borrowing my car” the last 3 days because she need to get an oil changed. We had Friday off together and just did yard work...I took the hint
5629 2018-05-26 18:11:44 The one that has oil too is good na. I prefer that one sef
5630 2018-05-26 18:11:43 As far as his foriegn tour, its very necessary for Him. He has solved many issues which was mishandled by cong gov
Ex- cong govt kept on.purchasing oil frm iran without bothering for pay, and left 5 billion usd loan of iran oil. Modiji cleared this, there r many more such issues.
5631 2018-05-26 18:11:22 Shit just got real, I'm going to the oil field in 2 weeks. Lol
5632 2018-05-26 18:11:19 I have the same problem and I’ve tried everything, even got prescribed an anti inflammatory but now I just take fish oil, glucosamine, and use CBD since it is a nuero anti inflammatory. It seems to be the key 
5633 2018-05-26 18:11:18 God forbid. I'd rather buy you anointing oil.
5634 2018-05-26 18:11:01 Go to Walmart and get you some peppermint oil and put it in a spray bottle and spray it or some lavender oil.. Spray it on your bed make yo room cool take a nap it helps! That’s a natural remedy!
5635 2018-05-26 18:10:53 cooking scrambled eggs with butter is so much better than with cooking oil tbh
5636 2018-05-26 18:10:49 That’s propaganda from the oil industry and has been soundly repudiated by the scientific community.
5637 2018-05-26 18:10:33 They go up every summer no surprise. And Trump dont control the oil companies. And Obummer did get his foot in the door on a couple of things with the economy but lost it on the back end with poor trade bad border control and welfare.  Trump took his bread crumb and fed a army
5638 2018-05-26 18:10:30 Butter think of an alternative then. Margarine has owada oil

5642 2018-05-26 18:09:59 They have flourishing casinos, reservations all over the country, and benefit from everything Americans invented. Things like electricity, railroads, oil, steel. A lot of worse places people can be...
5643 2018-05-26 18:09:32 Alright coo rich doin a oil change on his bike real quick then we gonna pull up
5644 2018-05-26 18:09:23 Yet YOU stand in the way of Drilling, Pipelines, Rail transport, refineries, and oil terminals. GET OUT OF THE WAY OF THE AMERICAN OIL INDUSTRY.
5645 2018-05-26 18:09:20 You were asking about oil oh and nopes, Yoruba too this Okro soup., not just the plain one.
5646 2018-05-26 18:09:16 pulled out the cbd oil x vape pen just in time for these stupid ass cramps.

5648 2018-05-26 18:08:21 Fuuuuck I really need a oil change but I’m gonna say fuck it and cop this I need something new to hold my cam 
5649 2018-05-26 18:07:34 Stay in place the oil is flowing 

I just heard God say that to me while I was in prayer
5650 2018-05-26 18:07:18 BIG CONCERN.. Plane travel!

5652 2018-05-26 18:07:07 CBD oil is available here over the counter and is in even the grocery store now. Can you get some of that or some cannabis to help with the negative side effects of the pain meds?

I would bring some to you if I could <3
5653 2018-05-26 18:07:06 It's time for common ground and being reasonable. I can't believe this childishness. We have to work together. BC and Alberta need each other. Oil is a fact of life and we all want what is best for the environment too. There has to be a trade off.
5654 2018-05-26 18:07:02 @jinjibb  you bringing the oil over or what 
5655 2018-05-26 18:06:54 OPEC has been fighting this because they know Iran will dilute profits. Saudi Arabia is protecting their interests. It’s economics, it’s oil, and it’s greed.
5656 2018-05-26 18:06:53 Trump proves that Americans in the red states are ignorant fools. Rich know he is a moron, but want tax cuts. No excuse exists for the ignorant clowns, too stupid to realize the gas price hikes are all Trumps fault. Iran sanctions & allowing exports of gas/oil hurt supplies.

5663 2018-05-26 18:05:41 If the PM has any concern for the Indian poor, make the oil companies reduce fuel prices forthwith. Indian economy can withstand the effect of slashing the prices by Rs.30/-per litre of petrol and diesel.  All oil companies are making profits and top managers enjoying like kings.
5664 2018-05-26 18:05:37 California has been way ahead of the feds since 1960  and we will fight to stay that way Big oil is NOT going to pollute our air water or soil Go away mob crime kingpin who wants to let Russia sell more oil at higher prices

5681 2018-05-26 18:03:23 Mr. Bhat can u clarify the International Oil Price for same period?
5682 2018-05-26 18:03:23 Don't agree with Prof Williams that hurting Russia is a good thing with the exports given that it creates higher prices in the USA for natural  gas and oil. US businesses are hit with higher costs, public is hit with higher costs. All that economic waste here to hurt Russians.
5683 2018-05-26 18:03:12 Shri @rajnathsingh dodged all tough questions and no concrete answers were given related to current farmer's situation in country or high oil prices ! #FuelPriceHike @RajatSharmaLive @indiatvnews
5684 2018-05-26 18:03:12 Plenty of water for hydration, cold compresses in the morning (metal spoons in the fridge overnight), and an under eye moisturizer (jojoba oil is cheap and doesn't have weird additives). Sleep is best obvi but let's be realistic

5687 2018-05-26 18:03:05 Even longer than that, peak oil still hasnt been realized.
5688 2018-05-26 18:03:01 Where is the factor of "oil bonds" in this analysis?
5689 2018-05-26 18:02:55 Read the Integrated Impact Assessment on the PH Proposals. Someone at @LondonAssembly said that we are being listened to, it just takes a long time...like an oil tanker doing a 3 point turn in the High Street.

5725 2018-05-26 17:58:05 They keep their own oil anyway.
5726 2018-05-26 17:57:59 Without fail, every time I have to wait for my oil change, I get stuck listening to old white people bitch about the ways of the world. 
As I type this they just moved on to talking about Trump...Fuck!
5727 2018-05-26 17:57:53 I hate scheduling an appointment for an oil change just to still have to wait almost2 1/2 hours .... everytime
5728 2018-05-26 17:57:48 It is NOT that the debt had accumulated due to UPA-2.
Iran was under sanctions from USA and therefore they were shipping oil at half the rates to us.
We were in fact helping Iran out by this method.
After the sanctions were lifted Iran started insisting on full payment.
Gobermind
5729 2018-05-26 17:57:41 Removing the U.S. from the Iran deal caused the price of crude oil to rise. One country that benefits tremediously is Russia. You know, the one that is ruled by the guy who tells Don the Con what to do. Russia really needed to price of oil to go up. And how to do it was obvious.

5735 2018-05-26 17:56:16 What's up with the petrodollar? How long do you keep think you can keep the monetary system of float? Especially with Iran not accepting any more US dollars for their oil
5736 2018-05-26 17:56:14 The bottom line is that #Islam is by far, the world's fastest growing religion-- a feat not even Christians with their hoards of cash can do to the masses in Africa, the Canadian is chosing Islam w/ their own will.

5757 2018-05-26 17:53:45 No it’s not profitable. The US, which is nearly oil independent hasn’t built a refinery since 1976! Canada’s last refinery was 1984. If the economics made sense they would build them. Fact is they are not nearly as profitable due to domestic needs being met.

5762 2018-05-26 17:52:55 India has gdp more than combined Middle East , in 10 years with oil demand decreasing you will be begging  world even for food grains , dumb illetrate .
5763 2018-05-26 17:52:52 We try our very best to buy from the Best global suppliers but recognize that there will be some issues regardless of how hard we try and then screen at every possible place and oil when needed. It’s tricky
5764 2018-05-26 17:52:51 I was gonna do some productive shit today maybe, but after this oil change I might need a nap lol
5765 2018-05-26 17:52:49 Mr. President, please check that we have more natural resources than Japan. They imported oil from other countries same with the Philippines.
5766 2018-05-26 17:52:33 USA sends its' sons and daughters off to foreign lands to become killers. Is that how you raised your kids? To be killers, protecting oil companies? Killers, your kids?

5768 2018-05-26 17:52:15 It irritates me how vegans claim that it is accessible for everyone, when prices of vegan products make it blatently not accessible to everyone. Also, don't claim to be 100% ethical when you eat products with Palm Oil in

5770 2018-05-26 17:52:09 And it was around $30-60 during 2014-2017 and back then price was still around 65-75rs 
price of crude oil collapsed to 1/3rd and still the end consumer paid around the same cost

5773 2018-05-26 17:51:54 The majority of these new jobs are in oil and gas mining. Coal mining jobs are pretty much the same number now as then.
5774 2018-05-26 17:51:46 Jawab toh dena hi padega! Because, the centre will have to bear the brunt in 2019 elections. The states, while enjoying he fruits of high oil prices, are blaming the centre and taking political advantage!
5775 2018-05-26 17:51:32 Natural gas and ATF may come under GST soon. A huge positive for aviation and oil exploration and production companies.

With aim to include to include Petrol and Diesel too under GST in the near future, this will boost the economy in a big way.
5776 2018-05-26 17:50:57 That's right

5828 2018-05-26 17:45:16 We went through 10 years of hell with the last leader, Steven Harper. He removed alot of our environmental protection laws. Even allowed for oil drilling on our national parks. Justin Trudeau put them back though. We have a great leader now

5838 2018-05-26 17:43:20 From an environmental perspective and from the perspective of an oil producing country we should be cheering high prices
5839 2018-05-26 17:43:19 Like two months ago I dropped like a cup of super duper hot oil on my foot and now it just looks ugly dark
5840 2018-05-26 17:43:11 Remember oil prices are not just linked to petrol and Diesel prices that ppl pay to put it in cars. But it has impact on almost all major industries including food supply. Expect the prices of food grains to inc if Diesel prices go up. Then you will still blame DrSingh and Nehru.

5850 2018-05-26 17:41:54 Crude prices were much higher. Modi govt has enjoyed the fruits of keeping the cons oil prices high despite global reduction in oil prices. Now when the global oil prices rise, govt should step in and do the needful when the prices increases.

5861 2018-05-26 17:40:48 It's too unfortunate that we do not give credit to the previous governments where it is due. I understand why the oil prices are high.

5888 2018-05-26 17:37:37 Blaming conservatives is hilarious. Instead of killing the oil industry in the 80's, papa Trudeau could have used all that NEP money to build refineries. Liberals wasted that opportunity. So go ahead and blame Conservatives, but blame every single government since the 70"s too.

5908 2018-05-26 17:34:44 My job as an engineer in the offshore oil/gas industry is to make certain the ocean is protected. 
I design safety systems and protocols for offshore facilities.
No Deepwater Horizon ever again. 
I love the oceans. I will do all I can to keep them safe.
5909 2018-05-26 17:34:32 Paychecks used to buy me clothes and fun, now they buy gas, oil changes, and everything else that sucks
5910 2018-05-26 17:34:28 A good plate of pasta with the right amount of olive oil and secret spices is priceless.
5911 2018-05-26 17:34:27 Stretches then snaps. The back feels a frayed and burnt. I use coconut oil, argan oil, leave in conditioner and i still pull out clumps when i brush it. I can hear ever hair break when i run my fingers through it if its slightly wet ;-;
Which is why im shaving it xD
5912 2018-05-26 17:34:27 Oh and cinnamon oil smells like Christmas so there's that extra plus.
5913 2018-05-26 17:34:10 Gas prices expected to cost Americans One Billion dollars more this holiday weekend. We all want to thank @realdonaldtrump for causing this to happen by his ridiculous moves in the middle east. There goes your big tax cut folks, given back to big oil and his Saudi Arabia buddies
5914 2018-05-26 17:34:09 I can see the primrose oil comments. So disappointing.
5915 2018-05-26 17:33:56 Oh & I sprayed the perimeter of my house and backyard with a mixture of cinnamon oil, clove oil & h2O.

5916 2018-05-26 17:33:48 Betcha it'll be burning oil just under 25,000 miles.
5917 2018-05-26 17:33:48 I just got my 2 bottles of Spring Honey Lilac... I'm in love!!! I smell like Lilac from head to toe with the CC, Styling cream, Mousse, Oil, EDP and UNIBT. Now I just need it in a hairspray Chaz!!! 
5918 2018-05-26 17:33:32 It would be much better if our country exported farmers an equipment to underdeveloping countries instead of missiles, and oil sucking private cia props.
5919 2018-05-26 17:33:31 That's pretty hilarious. The government makes money off every single barrel of oil taken out of the ground. And they spend that money on whatever, no matter what party it is. Upgrades are billions of dollars. Ask the NDP or liberals if they would like to build a couple.
5920 2018-05-26 17:33:29 I agree that lettuce is not exciting.  My favourite salad is mango, avacado, red onion, cucumber, with rice wine vinegar, oil, cilantro or parsley.  (Salt and pepper) Serve it beside a juicy steak or with fish.
5921 2018-05-26 17:33:27 inject coconut oil into your heart. fucking. jam it in there. fuck. fucking. bathe in it. stick your face in it. fucking. coconut oil RAW
5922 2018-05-26 17:33:22 Don’t feel bad, I went over a year without getting my oil changed and finally when the light was FLASHING on my dash I went and got it changed. The guys go “thank god hondas don’t need oil to run cause this shit is dry” 

I was like.... oops

5925 2018-05-26 17:32:59 Lemme know if you need an Uber LOL. I need to buy oil for a service.
5926 2018-05-26 17:32:58 I use rosemary essential oil(not infused or flavored), rubbed on carotid and temple, lie down for 1hour and wake up hungry without pain. I know it sounds like crystal gripping, tree hugging nonsense, but it works for me. I hope it does for you, if you choose to try it.
5927 2018-05-26 17:32:14 Trump what’s with your oil prices I paid under 2 bucks with Obama as President . GOP  always screws the people on gas prices !
5928 2018-05-26 17:31:54 The term oil sands replaced tar sands decades ago.
Oil development & environmental research can & does coexist.
Everyone is entitled to hold opinions without denigrating other views.
KM is a volatile topic but not so volatile as to reject careful consideration of all sides.
5929 2018-05-26 17:31:36 I believe small out of pocket costs to have an oil change or go to the GP goes a long way - extending the life of ones car & ones self. We should consider it the responsibility of life. HC insurance would be much cheaper if used truly only as "insurance", not for colds & such.
5930 2018-05-26 17:31:36 From you guys? Let me guess: goat urine and motor oil.
5931 2018-05-26 17:31:30 The reason Russians are the enemy is complex. But really, all you have to do is take an aerial tour with a map program.  All those black dots are sink holes, caused by drilling oil.  All those fields of wheat use irrigation. Water that never goes south into China.

5935 2018-05-26 17:30:57 It is that season once again when people of influence in traditional and New Media will face the temptation of selling their conscience, words and voice to the highest bidders.

5944 2018-05-26 17:29:33 Cant compete with oil money. They buy players to stop rest buying them. Only hope we ever have is if usmanov comes in
5945 2018-05-26 17:29:28 How can they be so unaware of the millions who have died in US airstrikes over the decades for oil & petro$. We've been under a brutal regime for quite awhile. How can they not know - MSM is why
5946 2018-05-26 17:29:25 After we've killed all the baby bears, after we've killed enough animals for trophy's, after no one tells anyone about poor quality drinking water, after we've given all the beautiful refuges to oil companies to drill. Lastly, after Putin sets up his office in the White House?
5947 2018-05-26 17:29:17 Vulnerable to a real estate correction for sure. But will a revival in the oil patch help to offset? So far #cdnecon doing okay
5948 2018-05-26 17:29:13 The US is number 1 in the world with the following but not limited to these:
Food production, coal, military power, oil production,  and natural gas production. The US also is the largest contributor to global GDP (24.5%); China is number 2 at 14.7%. Japan is 3 Germany is 4.

5950 2018-05-26 17:28:58 They can't exactly move the oil and gas deposits to somewhere else.

5953 2018-05-26 17:27:46 How about the fact that over 80+ years even the Middle East countries haven’t come close to draining all their oil deposits. The largest in the world and easily accessible. Canada can only rap a fraction of the overall deposit.
5954 2018-05-26 17:27:41 Iight I needa get a oil change and smoke a Blunt
5955 2018-05-26 17:27:29 i love oil paints

5958 2018-05-26 17:27:14 Having a car is all fun until you have to fill up gas, or pay registration, or get an oil change or any other service 
5959 2018-05-26 17:27:01 You would think with all the fresh aloe, lavender oil, teatree oil, vitamin E oil, rosehip oil, multiple face washes that i use 2x a day and fresh rose water, and the gallons of water i drink , i would have some sort of control over my skin
5960 2018-05-26 17:26:40 Andy, last time gas was this high oil companies were getting >$100/barrel for their oil.Why not ask BIG OIL about price fixes?

5965 2018-05-26 17:26:17 Don't get him or his hair cut. Lookalike he's stuck his head in olive oil
5966 2018-05-26 17:26:11 To drop facial oil on your lashes just before applying them isn’t the best start to your night
5967 2018-05-26 17:26:00 most cantu products smell and feel like they threw in a vat of cooking oil. That's really y'alls fave natural hair brand?
5968 2018-05-26 17:25:59 Spectacular like an exploding oil refinery, a crashing 747 with full fuel tanks, Mount St. Helens, a ringside seat at a nuclear bomb detonation.
5969 2018-05-26 17:25:58 Hi Alison. I've re-read The Times piece twice now.  I can't see any mention of primrose oil. Maybe I need to go to Specsavers...
5970 2018-05-26 17:25:48 For wash day; mayo mask ( 7 chucks of mayo out the jar, 1 egg & black people sense of oil.) whip all of it together then you put it on your hair. Wet your hand & add water to make it stretch a little. Sit 30 minutes & then wash out.
5971 2018-05-26 17:25:44 FB-146

When Petrol prices will rise again then it will be due to crude oil price hike. Otherwise its good governance.

5972 2018-05-26 17:25:41 Any suggestions for good places here in Seguin to get my oil changed?
5973 2018-05-26 17:25:38 Hie. It's really amazing.  I have recently started working work acrylics.. but no much experience with oils. May I know how much time it takes for oil painting layer to dry ? @eevanikunen
5974 2018-05-26 17:25:28 Supplement Tip: Take High Quality Fish Oil Daily.  

Fish Oil helps provide EPA and DHA, two essential fatty acids, that dramatically improve brain functionand and reduce inflammation. However the quality matters, it's better to not take fish oil than to take bad fish oil.
5975 2018-05-26 17:25:22 I truly believe that a lot of countries could get along and live in peace if the US MIC would butt out of their personal and soverign state business.  We need to ban wars unless we are attacked.  Saudi's attacked on 911 but we need their oil, so Iraq got "blamed".   Ratings.
5976 2018-05-26 17:25:11 Merciful Jesus, save us. That is why Trump gets away with fleecing America. You guys justify everything.  If he could bottle and sell the snake oil that makes otherwise ordinary people fall under his thrall, he would be a real billionaire.

5979 2018-05-26 17:24:33 Thanks, Michelle! It’s oil. I want to try acrylic for the faster drying time, but have so many oil paints it’s difficult to make the switch.

5989 2018-05-26 17:22:19 I will not criticise @PMOIndia @narendramodi for rising petrol price, because i know that tax lavied on Oil will go for social schemes and defence enhancement. we can't compromise with our social schemes and defence technology. @BJP4India will make India Superpower. #tech
5990 2018-05-26 17:22:04 Waiting for an oil change. I’ve had 2 coffees and 4 packs of those orange peanut butter crackers. A little girl, who has spent most her time chewing LEGOs, just pointed at me and said ‘bad’ #MemorialDayWeekend2018
5991 2018-05-26 17:21:57 I don't know of any videos, but I highly recco Oil 101 by Morgan Downey, great fundamental book, it can get a bit technical (chemistry wise), but you may like that
5992 2018-05-26 17:21:47 Can’t win for losing get home from the store and notice my car is pouring oil. At Midas now they trying to locate the leak #thissucks

5999 2018-05-26 17:20:52 He did.... Haven't u seen his tweet where he introduced the video?
6000 2018-05-26 17:20:28 So many ends, but somehow he scates. Power of the NRA, big oil & an immoral congress. I think so 
6001 2018-05-26 17:20:21 Know a little about oil trusts but they seem a little risky in that they are for long term & only until wells are no longer good & you cld end up after investing for that period only recouping what you originally invested or at least that is the way I understand it.
6002 2018-05-26 17:19:51 No.  Most oil sands production goes to delayed cokers and hydrocrackers and is upgraded to gasoline and diesel.  The world will need it even when the MARPOL rules kick in.  The world is madly building to upgrade heavy fuel oil.
6003 2018-05-26 17:19:31 companies positioned oil as a passport to modernity; oil cities run by Western capital but dependent on local labor were advertised as vessels for industrialization. Such rhetoric was borrowed by modernizing regimes in the Middle East and Latin America, which were oil dependent
6004 2018-05-26 17:19:20 I always pre poo my man’s hair & today was no different. I let him do mine & this fool forgot I had a hair cut  oil running all down my face lmao

6008 2018-05-26 17:18:48 Olive oil and pure organic honey helps keep me looking young
6009 2018-05-26 17:18:46 Why isn’t the media asking Donald what he is doing to protect us?
Heck when there was an oil leak it was Obama’s fault, didn’t they offer up Joe the plumber to fix it
6010 2018-05-26 17:18:37 Again. Read the article you posted. All the info you require is there. This was in the past when oil revenues were good. They aren’t there now and likely won’t ever be again. We also (scotland/UK) still borrow to maintain services and it costs more in Scotland to do this.
6011 2018-05-26 17:18:33 Just another area where U.S. abdicated leadership & advantages 2 special interests. That API promo attempting 2 claim, w/the thin business blonde, how we're no.1 in gas & soon 2B in oil,. true or not,. too late! Times up 4 global bullies!
6012 2018-05-26 17:18:31 the guy changing my oil asked me how my day was going and i said long and he said “well you look mad so i was asking”

THIS IS JUST MY NORMAL FACE HOMIE
6013 2018-05-26 17:18:24 Sue, I’m not ALL IN for oil. Transition will happen, is happening. No one is denying that. That transition however will take many decades and even then oil will be needed. That is where we disagree.
6014 2018-05-26 17:18:14 يحطون كريمات بعد عشان الاثار بس مدري وشي بالضبط لكن الاكيد انه ال bio oil من ضمنهم ومع الالتزام رجع كلش زي الفل

6020 2018-05-26 17:17:42 Ah the petro-dollar bringing democracy to an oil rich state near you. Some of the things he's doing are impressive no doubt, what are the motives ego and money. That sounds like an excellent idea btw  Avatar but from the slant of Orwell.
6021 2018-05-26 17:17:42 There were early signs of oil’s social cost, through urban pollution, motor vehicle accidents, ecological devastation (Mexico’s Golden Lane a good example, or the Mississippi Delta’s petrochemical complex). These signs were ignored or obfuscated by company propaganda
6022 2018-05-26 17:17:41 Tax collection has doubled, crude oil prices have gone down by 75% and yet petrol prices are rising and government can't lower tax on petrol without affecting social programs. What kind of black magic is this?
6023 2018-05-26 17:17:37 5 mins delay. 6:25 for newcomers controlled lap due to oil on the road from cronk-ny-mona to sign post. #IOMTT
6024 2018-05-26 17:17:34 #Rice bran oil
This oil is a fairly new entrant and is gaining quite a lot of popularity. This oil is made from the bran or outer layer of the grain of rice. The oil has oryzanol, a chemical which is good for maintaining cholesterol levels in the body.
6025 2018-05-26 17:17:29 For some idiotic reason though UEFA decided to call it 'Finacial Fair Play' when in reality it doesn't tackle the issues that most are "concerned" about you could say (oil teams and that)
6026 2018-05-26 17:17:15 :-( I prescribe a combination of gin (taken internally) and lavender oil (taken externally)
6027 2018-05-26 17:17:08 Oil industry? #RFID is being used to automatically identify assets out in the field, in lay down yards, on rigs, & wherever there's oil.
6028 2018-05-26 17:17:04 If we wait to transition from oil for much longer, we are looking at warming the earth by 4-6 degrees. If we build that pipeline and new coal and LNG and keep burning them. That means many of those millions of people won’t make it. Neither will most other species.
6029 2018-05-26 17:17:04 Dollar's value is fluctuating

6038 2018-05-26 17:16:29 wat about crude oil prices past and now, Hope it make sense
6039 2018-05-26 17:16:08 Might want to consider Exxon was underperforming when oil was moving up.

6041 2018-05-26 17:15:45 Has there ever been a commodity or good which baked social cost into price? Certainly not oil, which was for decades managed by an oligopoly that controlled production and set prices for maximum profitability, propped up by generous provisions from the US tax code
6042 2018-05-26 17:15:38 Standard Oil. They're just told him following his money; then on.
6043 2018-05-26 17:15:37 That oil company would be C IT GRAND it's not petroleum but rather glorified monkey piss.. Absolute worst gasoline on the market. Haven't bought it since 2005.  Boycott CITGO and your car will run longer and better.
6044 2018-05-26 17:15:18 You don't know about #Aramco without you've read a book by the name of Saudi, Inc. by @EnergzdEconomy . It's a trove of fact, a reference to return to, and belongs on any #oil enthusiast's bookshelf. The best part is it respects the history and takes pains to get it right.

6055 2018-05-26 17:14:08 He actually did not destroy the economy in Kansas. Over 17,000 new businesses were created on his watch. The problem was the crash in oil prices, something he had no control over.

6058 2018-05-26 17:14:03 Dear Pappu,

With all due respect I wished @INCIndia had a smarter president who gave some better challenge like a debate or so. 

The crude oil price has corrected 10% from recent high and his team will surely reduce the price but plz don't take credit of it.

Will there be a problem if one switches frm Q500 to Q700?
6071 2018-05-26 17:12:30 Earlier govt,instead of recovering loans provided relief and extentions for repay also gave defaulted companies additional funds
Best example-Kingfisher &
Ruchi soya, a edible oil co got loan of 37000cr during UPA1 AND UPA2
All these were non recovarable loans which are now NPA's
6072 2018-05-26 17:12:24 Seems like it, somemore got bike waiting on the roadside, so its a sign of something going on there

Then again, the oil slick usually susah nak tgk most of the time

6073 2018-05-26 17:12:22 CBD oil is great because it makes 4 hours of sleep feel like 9. What they dont tell you is that you'll dream that your teeth have been replaced with chalk sticks and you have to enter a jawbreaker chewing contest against your grade school bully.

6076 2018-05-26 17:12:09 I know people say “drink water” for everything but drink water 

Also when my nails were really weak I got into the habit of soaking and scrubbing my nails with olive oil and brown sugar (olive oil and sugar is also a really good lip repair esp. for winter)
6077 2018-05-26 17:12:05 We are plotting and ingratiating and feuding over oil licences. Several decades hence, we will be plotting and ingratiating and feuding over oil licences

6090 2018-05-26 17:10:39 Once it starts spitting oil at me, time to get a new one (this one was old, so it was time). Home Depot has a nice Ryobi one for under $100 that includes a $100 battery for free.
6091 2018-05-26 17:10:38 Amit Shah to journalists: Even in UPA rule, fuel prices were similar to what it is today. So why are you complaining, it’s been only a few days

Nobody questions his arrogance neither his ignorance - because then crude oil  was $145 & today it’s $80

6094 2018-05-26 17:10:01 Govt shd find alternate method to reduce oil price. Add petroleum products in GST nd impose fuel tax to new vehicles for a certain period to compensate state govt for their loss due to VAT cut.

6108 2018-05-26 17:08:29 Yep. But redesigning roads is expensive. Finding another way to get stock to your shops is expensive. Whilst marginal cost of motoring (private or commercial) is so cheap (high oil production, low interest rates) the culture of motoring will abide.

Russia & Syrian Army should focus on the ISUS pocket in the oposite of Euphrates River to recover Oil & Gas Fields before liberating Idlib or Dara...
6117 2018-05-26 17:07:10 They all existed before the oil and gas industry. But really I don't care about this back and forth. It's crazy, we are like different animals you folks love oil/gas  and believe it's great we believe it's toxic and damages the environment, and therefore would should reduce use.

But surely the whole 'Smiling after WALTER chops my chest red' is a thing of 'Look at how tough I am that I survived this'.
6132 2018-05-26 17:05:24 The advantage of low crude price didn't come to public. Diffence or infrastructure or health scheme was not introduced by present govt. It was there from wen India got independence. But govt took the burden of increasing oil price to keep the prices hike of day to day items.

6154 2018-05-26 17:02:39 Your actions has caused oil prices to climb and gas is becoming more expensive.  You don't know what the hell you are doing.  You are not being respected by the world, you are making it more dangerous.
6155 2018-05-26 17:02:34 Economics aren’t your strong point either, neither is the commodity market. 1 tanker of oil = 10x the refined “products” at the end point. That would mean at least 10x the transportation cost to ship refined products overseas. You do realize just how many things are made from oil
6156 2018-05-26 17:02:29 I feel bad for you so here are some tips

6157 2018-05-26 17:02:28 Govt have many sources of income. Oil is a commodity which increases the family budget. It effects common man.. and only common man. That must be under a balance. Wen crude price was low also present govt. increased exice duty and kept it as it.

6172 2018-05-26 17:00:51 Govt shd find alternate method to reduce oil price. Add petroleum products in GST nd impose fuel tax to new vehicles for a certain period to compensate state govt for their loss due to VAT cut. @narendramodi @AmitShah @dpradhanbjp @PiyushGoyal @nitin_gadkari
6173 2018-05-26 17:00:49 Ok good now show me the amount to conventional car companies and oil industry. Thanks

6176 2018-05-26 17:00:32 @GEJonathan just found his voice! He's not offering solutions based on his 6 yrs experience as President, he's comparing his lethargic socio-economic policies with @MBuhari inaction; is he also looking at the oil revenue during his time and now? Can he pls shot up?#NaijaVirals

6178 2018-05-26 17:00:13 ARE CHEAP OIL CHANGES GOOD FOR THE CAR?

When planning to get an oil change, people always look for a cheaper option thinking it doesn’t make much difference. 
TYPES OF OILS
There are basically two major types of oils regular oil and synthetic oil. Regular oil is distilled an
6179 2018-05-26 17:00:09 The 42's sold our country's wealth to our enemies  In 97 42 sold our naval petroleum reserves to OXY owned by Dr. A. Hammer, patron of Al Gore Sr. & Jr., & winner of Soviet Lenin award.  They sold rare molybdenum to China, and our Uranian to RU. 44 shut down Gulf oil 4 GS profit.
6180 2018-05-26 17:00:00 It looks OK from here I can't see any oil leaks
6181 2018-05-26 16:59:57 That wild hair growth oil really works
6182 2018-05-26 16:59:56 Not sure how you equate 0.15 percent (which is oil sands GHG output) to a whopping 16%, or 30% (yesterday’s claim). That’s literally a 150-200x increase through a pipeline that will 3x the current capacity. 

Math isn’t your strong point is it.
6183 2018-05-26 16:59:48 lmao i am this  close in stanning monsta x and here i am adding more oil to the fire skfkskfms
6184 2018-05-26 16:59:39 Anyone interested in CBD oil, CBD vape or our full spectrum Cannibas oil line?
6185 2018-05-26 16:59:38 Social license is a fiction.  It’s a delay tactic to avoid decisive action.  We need to stop talking about social license and start talking about how to fund social causes.  The answer: resources.  Oil.  Pipelines.
6186 2018-05-26 16:59:35 Remember the situation he met in 1984. Hyperinflation, maitatsine, accrued debts and no savings. Remember the situation in 2015. Crash in oil prices, boko haram, sabotage in the Niger delta, accrued debts and no savings. Take all of these into account and judge accordingly.
6187 2018-05-26 16:59:30 Yea, but that would require politicians not getting paid off by big oil-gas-coal industries. Renewable energy already is surpassing them. Its the future: efficient, clean, indefinite power.

Like when cars were made you didn’t see people trying to cling to their horse and buggy.
6188 2018-05-26 16:59:22 Oh honey no wonder you're still hungover at 6pm. Malibu rum is like drinking suntan oil. Uggh.

6190 2018-05-26 16:59:14 This is a good way to increase our energy independence from foreign oil, and create jobs in the alternative power industry.
6191 2018-05-26 16:59:09 Good question ommen candy but no point ask to pm  modi....better ask to king saudi or donald trump...your own country no crude oil manufacturing....how you think less price
6192 2018-05-26 16:58:47 when you get that "u up?" text but it's just your dad reminding you not to forget to get your oil changed tomorrow
6193 2018-05-26 16:58:29 Bernie would finish destroying their economy by turning off the oil spigot to prevent climate change!
6194 2018-05-26 16:58:22 Yes, I agree! But I don’t know if wearing oil and sitting in the sun for 8 hours straight is good for me 
6195 2018-05-26 16:58:21 Im about to get some cbd oil for em
6196 2018-05-26 16:58:07 How did you acquire the wealth used to establish an operational commercial airline in Cape Verde?  Remember, you were part of the governors that insisted that the excess oil crude money must be shared, shame on you Adams.
6197 2018-05-26 16:57:59 If the price of pms has increased with the rate of crude oil, we would have criticised buhari to heavens and of course he deserves it. There's no local capacity to support consumption and importation is complex. He has to introduce the subsidy to cushion the effect.
6198 2018-05-26 16:57:54 And NOW we know exactly what happened so that point is no longer a point
6199 2018-05-26 16:57:42 I want @manjrekarmahesh to ask bully gang one question. In the frame task what strategy according to them was appropriate to bring shelya down? Because as per them:
Rose-unfair
Shampoo/oil/etc-unfair 
Mocking cigarette-unfair 
But breaking the whole frame-fair! #BiggBossMarathi
6200 2018-05-26 16:57:41 You should also mention how much Jonathan generated from oil within the same period. It's not only converting old buildings to universities but also upgrading the dilapidated universities into modern ones.
6201 2018-05-26 16:57:39 And no citations from oil companies or other questionable sources.
6202 2018-05-26 16:57:38 No way am I selling Exxon are anything oil related at this time. Markets are reacting to political BS instead actual profits. The areas Trump opened for drilling are a long way from production but when on line should boost profits and availability. Love the dividend

6210 2018-05-26 16:56:55 I did! I don't accept the argument that the promise of (tomorrow's) #AI excuses the problems with (today's) data-driven approaches, anymore than clean energy excuses oil. But I certainly agree that AI will be a big part of #healthcare solutions.
6211 2018-05-26 16:56:49 David, How many  do you prefer get killed in dictator regimes when you promote #bloodoil ?  Canada’s Gay friendly oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss  off buildings.

6215 2018-05-26 16:56:26 Y’all know the oil companies basically control the gas prices right? Lmao trump doesn’t wake up every morning and go “well I think I’ll set it here today”. It’s summer. Shit always goes up. Get a job to pay for your gas 
6216 2018-05-26 16:56:25 Just showered with some essential oils, now ima chill in bed drink some green tea and listen to Asa whilst reading Maya Angelou’s “Letter to my daughter”, I also have lavender oil on a burner. It’s been a beautiful day. Peace be with you all 
6217 2018-05-26 16:56:22 It is possible I might not do the right justice to this debate. The price of oil should be determined by the forces of demand and supply i.e crude oil. The subsidy was reduced when the oil price was low and was justifiable. Now that oil price has increased?
6218 2018-05-26 16:56:17 #JBsWordsofwisdom @JBItela told me vegetable oil is not veggies at all so I bought canola oil instead #thriving

6221 2018-05-26 16:55:53 whomever in stack 11 started an OIL FIRE at 9:30am on a saturday. fuck u sir.
6222 2018-05-26 16:55:43 It is crazy really but I suppose we like it as an outpost or if oil or gold is discovered. I think the Falklanders like being British too
6223 2018-05-26 16:55:34 Don't remember seeing pickle of those vegetables. Made in mustard oil? That's very flavorful. Yeah, that mango thing is more a delish, no?

6228 2018-05-26 16:55:06 Sounds good to me!  However, you know how that goes.  Some people can't/won't do a simple oil change without making a big production out of it and spending a fortune on it. It takes all kinds to make the world go round, huh?
6229 2018-05-26 16:54:56 This is Nigeria! If Govt. finds oil in ur backyard It's
govt. property, but if they find weed, It's yours and you're going to jail

6231 2018-05-26 16:54:49 My brokerage told me the trade needs to settle before they can transfer it from USD to CDN trading account.
In two business days, even without material news, the stock price can either go up or down, so that is the risk. I wouldn't recommend oil stocks after the rally.
6232 2018-05-26 16:54:48 But then why 200% +  tax on fuel ? 

Best part as and when the crude oil price gets increased common man will bleed 200% of it

6236 2018-05-26 16:54:27 Most oil comes from canada. We need to let drilling happen again in the US. Gas was cheaper when we had US competition.

6239 2018-05-26 16:54:11 That's my point too. Is the government doing business of selling Petrol and Diesel to its people and earning profit!
Will the salaried person be able to bear the price and the rise of other prices due to diesel price rise. The subsidy which you mentioned went to oil companies
6240 2018-05-26 16:54:02 Castor oil has been used as a healing agent for centuries. Heat combined with castor oil helps increase blood circulation to your liver and pulls toxins out of it through the skin. An easy, painless #detox therapy you can do at home.

6244 2018-05-26 16:53:51 Why should they? Our point is that the government spends 3.3 Billion a year subsidizing the oil industry. Just ONE year of that money would easily pay for that grid and a whole lot more.

6260 2018-05-26 16:52:27 It is a quality issue as WTI Midland does have little octane. It is possible to mix shale with API 60 with heavy oil at 25 , so that you have API 32, yet this will be low octane feedstock. That is the whole dilemma of shale. Distillate is possible with heavy oil but not gasoline.
6261 2018-05-26 16:52:06 Like organization, like employee..
6262 2018-05-26 16:52:01 Right. O dropped my car off for oil change tire rotation etc... less than 2 mike walk home. I thought I would die. And I hike for miles in the mountains.

6291 2018-05-26 16:48:09 Thinking about the fact that Jordan is in Del Mar, California right now and I’m sitting here getting an oil change 
6292 2018-05-26 16:47:58 I told them  to change the oil regularly.

6303 2018-05-26 16:46:14 There's a plant outside of Houston called Petra Nova where they burn the coal and use the gas to travel about 80 miles away to an old oil field,they then use it to loosen up the *stubborn* oil,increase production.
Also Japan owns 50% of this *clean coal* job.
6304 2018-05-26 16:46:11 See it's not a matter of hating..we just have a habit of not respecting intellectual property in Nigeria.. at least falz should know better..#ThisIsNigeria

6306 2018-05-26 16:46:08 watching @koifresco video on CBD made me want to dig up my CBD oil & vape pen so I have it on deck for these stupid ass headaches, instead of spending all day in bed until they go away (i dont consume tylenol etc anymore). thanks for the reminder.
6307 2018-05-26 16:46:06 I agree bro bt if u r student then study the current demand supply trend on crude oil and the arabian politics on the crude oil. 
The arabs should b deprived of food and water and the price will go down.
6308 2018-05-26 16:45:52 Gave all of my dogs CBD oil and Benadryl because they could not stop barking at the gardener. Most of them fell asleep. My mama dog is the most nervous. She is still awake but not barking and anxious. I am grateful to have something simple to help them calm down.
6309 2018-05-26 16:45:47 I wonder if the left realizes that the further they drift toward insane authoritarian socialist nonsense, the more they alienate the hard-working men and women who grow the food, pump the oil, and keep the lights on.

Are those really the people you want to piss off?
6310 2018-05-26 16:45:44 No kidding. It's slightly more complicated. I hope people remember how many oil spills and disasters we've already had that ruined huge parts of the coast or the land itself. None of that has affected team Trump so far. Anybody heard of BP? Anybody seen Shale oil in the streets?
6311 2018-05-26 16:45:44 Better late than never FAM!
6312 2018-05-26 16:45:43 Lemme correct your information.
Oman is one the biggest oil producing country. I've been living here from last couple of years.
Petrol prices/litres - 212 Baizas which is equal to 35 India Rupee Approximately.
From where a person can get if for 31 Rupees? Please specify!!
6313 2018-05-26 16:45:41 寝れない子がいたら心配してホットミルクもってきてくれるけど良い子だからその横で早寝しちゃううぉるた～くん…(寝言
6314 2018-05-26 16:45:27 I left my oil paint brushes at school and Imma cry
6315 2018-05-26 16:45:21 MBS promise to make oil price above $80 but suddenly... Is there any news of MBS whereabout???
6316 2018-05-26 16:45:21 I just want to add that you don’t need oil revenue at certain price to send bills to NASS—pure leadership failure!
6317 2018-05-26 16:45:17 Check your Engine oil this afternoon.
6318 2018-05-26 16:45:17 When I hear ppl discusing about Petrol price hike in India during BJP tenure and its failure.
In Canada
2015 :1L petrol= 1 dollar i.e 50 Rs/l
2017 :1L petrol= 1.40 dollar i.e 72 Rs/l
Is it bcz of #P.M Modi or #worldcrudeoilprice
Canada has 3rd largest oil reserve.
India is 24th.
6319 2018-05-26 16:45:10 im eating too much of my chocolate banana cake. BUT IT IS SO DELICIOUS. STEPHANIE WASNT LYING, THE CAKE STAYS SOFT AND MOIST EVEN AFTER BEING REFRIGERATED, bcoz oil was used (instead of butter). and i used buckwheat flour coz it's the only one i have.
6320 2018-05-26 16:45:09 #democrat @chuckschumer is a joke. What States have the most Fuel Tax's and cost per gallon. Democrat run states. Who didn't want the US to drill for more oil? Democrats again. Lier
6321 2018-05-26 16:45:02 Every time I see a piece of clothing I like in a magazine or whatever, I look it up and it's like £350. Genuine question: who buys these things? I spent £280 on a jumper ONE TIME and my baby spilled a bottle of vegetable oil on it the same night.
6322 2018-05-26 16:45:01 Brethren, let us be mindful that Jesus Christ is coming again, so as faithful servants let us watch and pray for we do not know the hour or day of his coming. Let our lamps have the oil as wise servants for the days are evil.
6323 2018-05-26 16:44:53 Ongoing oil spill removal at EDSA Ayala Tunnel NB as of 11:40 PM. MPCG on site. Please take alternate route. #mmda
6324 2018-05-26 16:44:48 @PMOIndia dear sir,. Can you understand that when UPA curse Oil was about 106 dollar par barrel then petrol price 71₹ but when crude oil 80 dollar, then petrol price 85 ₹ ,......why
6325 2018-05-26 16:44:40 Plz give credit to the students,it is they who have studied well and hard, proverbially burnt midnight oil,what has Mr Sisodia done in this??this is stupidity and pure chamchagiri
6326 2018-05-26 16:44:24 Yeah man. When oil a ride yu, it nuffi ignore. Find a buddy and ride it into the sunset.
6327 2018-05-26 16:44:08 The only thing that could ruin your effort, would be to find out that after ruining the marriage and setting Pen and I up on a date, it turned out she wears patchouli oil.
6328 2018-05-26 16:44:06 Aw. Stay hydrated and also you can drink water with lemon as it helps purify you. If it's a nauseous feeling, cinnamon oil helps (a tea spoon) helps and gets rid of that feeling.
6329 2018-05-26 16:44:02 Oil his feet
6330 2018-05-26 16:43:55 He is doing a great job. We need to start drilling here in America. No more dependency on the Middle East for oil ! Screw them 
6331 2018-05-26 16:43:34 when you just filled your tank 2 days ago and you don’t have any gas in your car or enough money to pay bills + live for two weeks + oil change + gas ...

6333 2018-05-26 16:43:28 I use The Body Shop camomile cleansing butter. I think there is a liquid oil in that line too.

6335 2018-05-26 16:42:39 It's often derived from coconut oil but the proportions are heavily skewed to true medium chain fats.  Less liver processing required so it's quick energy for the brain and less insulin response.

6337 2018-05-26 16:42:09 Yea that’s nothing, & I’ll put the coconut oil on ya shit
6338 2018-05-26 16:42:02 To some, your posts and your speeches are like Castor Oil. Tough going down but in the end, everybody is better off for it. Keep it up, you have legions of supporters
6339 2018-05-26 16:41:56 It's been 1,000 days since the BP oil spill and the Gulf of Mexico still has not been restored.
6340 2018-05-26 16:41:54 Real proud of the way they were given the right to govern themselves..but then American Lawmakers and police routinely invade their land and destroy their hemp crops ILLEGALLY, destroy their land ILLEGALLY to push oil pipelines through ILLEGALLY.

6343 2018-05-26 16:41:43 Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil line. Everything is , makes detangling so easy, and makes my curls pop. What are you looking for exactly?
6344 2018-05-26 16:41:36 BJP government give Indirectly benefit to oil companies by increasing Price.......
6345 2018-05-26 16:41:28 How do you figure this only means money for Kinder Morgan? Alberta revenue is tied directly to oil price by way of the government's royalty being taken in kind and sold at market prices. Also by income tax, but property tax and by corporate tax.
6346 2018-05-26 16:41:02 Jamaican black castor oil is my holy grail of hair I swear my hair has grown so much since I started using it 
6347 2018-05-26 16:40:35 Health Tips: find out the oxidation index of the oil you cook with, and choose the lowest number combined with the highest smoke point.
6348 2018-05-26 16:40:29 I guess that's one way to drive up oil prices.

6355 2018-05-26 16:39:56 My hands are slippery from the tanning oil I just put on so I dropped my phone on my face 
6356 2018-05-26 16:39:55 i have to scrub my eyelashes with the oil but the result was amazing tho 
6357 2018-05-26 16:39:54 Omg I tried a new freaking oil for my face and it made my foundation oxidize even more. I have patchy orange foundation. I want to cry lol.
6358 2018-05-26 16:39:53 Dear Keralites, Let us celebrate  the oil price rise....my recent visit to UAE I could feel the enthusiasm of people on the growing oil price. This is going to give us more jobs and money.Kerala GOVT must also stop complaining  about raising petrol prices
6359 2018-05-26 16:39:51 But at his time, oil was more affordable than today.  On the other hand: many iPhones today, but less Monets...
6360 2018-05-26 16:39:51 Me vs Brain:
Me- woohoo, day off!
Brain- ya but we need to work on the yard, paint the hallway, change the oil in the car....
Me- who asked you? Shut up! *push slap bang* get back in your closet, IT IS A DAY OFF!
6361 2018-05-26 16:39:45 Fresh oil and a full tank of fuel. Puts me at peace driving that GMC
6362 2018-05-26 16:39:35 I was sick asf and wasnt peepin everything but that oil of oregano got me back in my bag now 

What's good.
6363 2018-05-26 16:39:34 A meteor hit the earth igniting the oil deposits in the ground entering the atmosphere, making it so dark that little light could pass through the smoke and soot therefore, plants cannot preform photosynthesis ultimately dying causing the dinosaurs to go extinct.
6364 2018-05-26 16:39:19 My understanding is hemp derived CBD Oil has 0.3% THC or less. But, it has it and can pop a positive test result if drug tested. Everything I’ve read says CBD Oil is only legal in TN if used for epilepsy.
6365 2018-05-26 16:39:03 They feed them some BS and the mob takes it as gospel. Then the hierarchy stop talking about it as they know it's rubbish

6368 2018-05-26 16:38:50 So if If it’s costing me an extra $20 a week to fill up my gas tank,  that’s $80 a month x 12months that’s $960.  Average middle class house hold tax break was $900... what I’m I missing here?  The oil companies got a tax break and ours too.
6369 2018-05-26 16:38:34 Oil change

6377 2018-05-26 16:37:49 Shannon Watts' superpower is being totally unfettered by logic or facts.

If it wasn't for Bloomberg's money. she'd be somewhere running an HOA giving some poor guy shit for changing his oil in his own driveway.
6378 2018-05-26 16:37:46 Came to do an oil change and I ended up paying for more then what I expected.
6379 2018-05-26 16:37:46 Dear @CNN , & @PoloSandovalCNN watching now report on gas price: question how might have the reported meetings of White House affiliations with oil rich middle eastern countries and the involvement of big money interests be effecting the 31 percent gas increase.  No mention.
6380 2018-05-26 16:37:30 oil change or check the level of the oil, also it could be you have a winter oil and now that is hot you need to change the oil thickness

6382 2018-05-26 16:37:21 This is unconsciousanable (sp?).  OMG, if we allowfrackingit must be ONLY FOR OIL OF OUR OWN USE!  No oil exports of domestic fracking!
6383 2018-05-26 16:37:07 Oil paints are a giant pain in the ass but they are so much prettier than acrylic :(
6384 2018-05-26 16:37:03 Over the short term, oil should remain  in the $60 to $80 bbl range.
(As price rise above $80 more drilling will happen reducing price)

ExxonMobil has made big bets on $100 plus bbl oil in Central Asia, Canada and Offshore, so it may be a while before ExxonMobil is back to $95.

6386 2018-05-26 16:36:51 @andersoncooper I admired UR hard work 4 transparency from BP's Oil pipe N the Gulf.

6392 2018-05-26 16:36:17 I am supporting, oil is here, we should get from somewhere that tries to extract/process/transport safely and with as little eco damage as possible,  we are in the middle of a transition btwn energy and next which isn't completely defined, look up other transitions usually 50 yrs
6393 2018-05-26 16:36:12 I’m getting my oil changed at my boyfriends work and as soon as I pull in everyone and the boss yell “the girlfriend is here” and he goes “fiancé”

6402 2018-05-26 16:35:21 Last I checked 4 of the 5 companies at the top of the Fortune 500 are oil companies. (Wal-mart's 5th.) Fossil energy's 1/6 of economy.

6404 2018-05-26 16:35:04 lol girl protective styles , no heat , wild growth oil and clipping my ends every two weeks
6405 2018-05-26 16:35:02 
6406 2018-05-26 16:35:01 I adulted today and got an oil change. Expect the next adult decision to happen in 3 to 5 thousand miles.
6407 2018-05-26 16:34:54 Mmm i seriously doubt Trump can accomplish anything since he wants a war.Hope I'm wrong. Maybe one war with Iran will be enough for him & Koch Bros.They want to steal oil. They've got oil prices up so Kochs & others happy? Fascists don't care if you pay 5.00+/gal. Seriously.
6408 2018-05-26 16:34:45 MCT oil could be a real lifesaver for you here, Rachel.
6409 2018-05-26 16:34:41 Stop lights, surgery, medicine, oil changes, insurance - ALL of these are designed to avoid disaster & death !! I say every single thing we do for School Security is part of that case scenario - preventing disaster & death !!! Are you going to say you DONT CARE ??
6410 2018-05-26 16:34:40 Indeed, strategically chosen name for their 'mission' for sure SMH
6411 2018-05-26 16:34:37 Are you afraid we will turn off the pipes tomorrow?  We know that won’t happen. BUT seriously, it would be a good idea to start transferring your skill set to renewables. They are automating the Oil industry fast, bleeding jobs. And boom ‘n bust cycles don’t happen in renewables.
6412 2018-05-26 16:34:29 Cheers! Just finished 4th at billowen. Held 3rd until engine spitting oil. I won't wave as I pass you tonight!
6413 2018-05-26 16:34:27 It's hot enough in our apartment that our thermometer on the thermostat cannot register the temperature but I know it's at least 76F because solid coconut oil cannot exist in this zone anymore.
6414 2018-05-26 16:34:20 No, it's protecting fossil fuels. Other countries cars going electric. Priority 1 was keystone pipeline, Putin's income from oil...
6415 2018-05-26 16:34:18 He can't--the blame for high gas prices is due to an easing glut(oil needs $70-80/barrel for production to break even) and Trump's stupidity re: Iran.
6416 2018-05-26 16:34:17 I need a vegan/cf version of mac cleans off oil 
6417 2018-05-26 16:34:15 Dad and I changed the oil in my car today. I weed-eated around the house and in the pasture. Dad mowed my lawn. Tired, but I still need to get a lot of steps today!
6418 2018-05-26 16:34:00 Growing up there mission my home town. Just hoping, praying for a CPC candidate that is more like Preston, Chong, Gordo (ecoFiscal Free marketer) less like Harper and VanderZalm (big oil and disingenuous populism)
6419 2018-05-26 16:33:51 You people don't half talk some Shyte. Oil is American??? Get a grip.. ffs
6420 2018-05-26 16:33:34 Lol bro let them pass the bill first ... it better to not letting it see the light of the day ... things will change with time ... a lot of people from that region will benefit from the bill. There is no good and enough pipe borne water due to oil spillage in that region.
6421 2018-05-26 16:33:33 Condemnable. Important to point out Syria/Assad regime is a secular tolerant country. It was torn to pieces because to protect oil, golan heights, America trained Jihadi Salafi Sunni rebles against Assad. This led to IS and mostly Sunnis leaving the state. Assad is a Shia.
6422 2018-05-26 16:33:08 Consider: You were subsidizing contributions to Donald Trump's 2020 re-election campaign from the "big oil" interests. So sorry, to be the one to tell you this.  (p.s. the screens are 2 way & mainly for security purposes - see a shooter/catch a shooter?)
6423 2018-05-26 16:33:00 A two litre bottle of olive oil at Costco and it's all good.
6424 2018-05-26 16:33:00 Gas prices were going up because oil prices were going up. If the oil prices fall, the gas prices will go back down. Also, they always go up during the summer time. Gas prices are another reason why we need to rely more on producing our own oil and rely less on foreign oil

6426 2018-05-26 16:32:55 I met that old bastard last night. He told me that the next flash point could come between Greece and Turkey over of shore oil drilling off Cypress. He knows his shit. When he told me about JFK and WMD in Iraq, that set me off.
6427 2018-05-26 16:32:53 Everyone can now find our house because joshs car has blown up and dripped oil for miles
6428 2018-05-26 16:32:52 Oh. Right. I need to replace my heater-hose oil drain line with real oil safe hose.

In my defense, I couldn’t find oil-safe 5/8th hose local to save my life when I was finishing up the turbo build.

6435 2018-05-26 16:32:16 Hyperinflationary economy precedes printing notes. Normally war ( Weimar : war reparations in other currencies/ gold ) Zimbabwe ( giving agri land to non farmers) Venezuela ( dollar debt as only export is oil plus drought and poor policy ) etc
6436 2018-05-26 16:32:11 Designmodo for oil
6437 2018-05-26 16:32:10 We use about 180 billions of gallons of gasoline each year.  If big oil is hammered and gas cost $1.00 per gallon than it might have, that is $180 B that can be spent on small businesses.
6438 2018-05-26 16:32:09 Continuing down the road that the bumbling PMO paved, the Chinese will end up in the driver’s seat not only with ownership of our oil fields but all of its production, leaving Canadians relying on Irving’s and Montreal’s Gang to determine supply, good bye competitive advantage.
6439 2018-05-26 16:31:31 Mole made. Chicken marinating. Tembleque in the fridge. Horchata soaking in bottles. Guacamole tomorrow. Now sipping the test paloma (tequila, grapefruit juice, lime and soda)

6450 2018-05-26 16:30:23 That, of course, is simply not true. It is based on impossible assumption that they will mine the entire oil sands. Something never in the plans and physically impossible to boot.
6451 2018-05-26 16:30:01 @jimcarr_wpg “The best way...” so lets burn all the oil in Tar Sands and create a dead planet. This is the same mindset of government/corporations years ago that approved tar sands development and the mess we are in today. I don’t want your future and we will fight to prevent it.
6452 2018-05-26 16:30:00 This sounds weird but try baby oil and try to just like run your hands over it and it should slowly pull the knot out without pulling too much hair out. Also I’ve always conditioned my hair and brushed it while it’s sitting then rinse and do it over about 2 times.
6453 2018-05-26 16:29:51 OIL
6454 2018-05-26 16:29:42 Does #fibromialgia affect you or a loved one? How do you cope? Other chronic pains and disorders as well. I’m curious as I’d been hearing incredible things and #CBD and #ketodiet and am loving them both. I’d love to hear other perspectives! #health #CBD_oil #cannicure #cbdforgood
6455 2018-05-26 16:29:31 More massage bars and a shampoo bar. I got a few of Wiccy Magic Muscles, Hottie and Pearl for massage bars and Jason and the Argon Oil for the shampoo bar. I’m SO addicted to Lush, so being in a 3 floor store with a spa was heavenly

6461 2018-05-26 16:29:02 My dear friend an SNP politician sadly now passed on had a pal who was a geologist who told him in 2016 that Scotland will have plenty of oil to see out the 21st century & beyond... there are still far more announcements to come both on & off shore.

6465 2018-05-26 16:28:34 Reminds me of those weird german people that ONLY put oil in their potato salad and no mayo or anythin ugh or even worse: THEY HEAT IT UP
6466 2018-05-26 16:28:32 Hopefully the walk packets aren’t big enough to require an oil change during it, though some of the volunteers did seem very dedicated

6473 2018-05-26 16:27:59 Oil companies are gouging consumers with rising gas prices beyond market demand, and your concern is a carbon tax?

6477 2018-05-26 16:27:25 A $100 for an oil change? Like.. my mind is blown?
6478 2018-05-26 16:27:24 Alright! The people have spoken. #TheExpanseLivesOn It’s like a machine that has been given its oil.  
6479 2018-05-26 16:27:18 Ah yes, let the oil sit for a little bit and then wipe it.
6480 2018-05-26 16:27:13 Like a nigga set the mood low lights candles some music playing and I’m rubbing her ass with oil and she moaning lightly....yes I’m eating it from the back and cleaning my plate
6481 2018-05-26 16:26:49 Ireland so far anyway doesnt have oil

6490 2018-05-26 16:25:48 Car too low and too much potholes is what caused my double oil filter breakage.
6491 2018-05-26 16:25:36 I trust olive oil! Once a week I massage my face before sleeping with olive oil and it works wonders!

6497 2018-05-26 16:25:07 Just think of all the poor Mericun oil companies that are disadvantaged by your not permitting to extract resources that are theirs to take, its a shame you aren’t more attentive to their needs!
6498 2018-05-26 16:25:06 I have heard of pregnant women that died just because they must deliver like " the Hebrew women" . And for the "so not lucky ones" the babies won't make it. 
I blame ignorance, anointing  oil and the so called "omi agbara".
6499 2018-05-26 16:25:02 Why not have the feds "derisk" investments in #renewable energy, instead of #fossilfuel? A certain win-win on both jobs and #climate, never mind oil spills.
6500 2018-05-26 16:24:58 Compare with crude oil price...
6501 2018-05-26 16:24:57 It's bussing. I came to this 10 min oil change by my house tryna get a quick one lol
6502 2018-05-26 16:24:44 If building an oil pipeline is in Canada’s national interest, why isnt getting control of rapidly rising gas prices also in Canada’s national interest? #cdnpoli #ableg

6514 2018-05-26 16:22:59 Simple TRUTHFUL reason... GENOCIDE and Continued GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra for oil(SLAVERY). The cup they poured out, they are given to drink till they repent publicly. RETURN THE STAR OF DAVID STOLEN FROM BIAFRA.
6515 2018-05-26 16:22:45 yazi ngathi they were deep fried with dirty oil
6516 2018-05-26 16:22:32 I agree with you. Having lived and worked around Roberts Bank, most people would be happy to see it wind down. Raw sewage the same. However sewage diluted in the ocean and coal spilt off the docks does little real environmental damage. Not so with oil.
6517 2018-05-26 16:22:04 Preheat the onions, dust a little oil.
6518 2018-05-26 16:22:03 I am not smug or sanctimonious.  Closer to desperate is more accurate. Why? Because people like you are dragging their heels and finding excuses to stick to oil when climate change is accelerating far beyond expectations and we are out of time! The consequences = very very grave.
6519 2018-05-26 16:21:46 Took @ruehjos car to get the oil changed and I saw a glimpse of my future where everyone pronounces my last name wrong

6522 2018-05-26 16:21:36 A unified currency but Nigeria will still export crude oil and impor petrol, export timber and import toothpicks from china.
You haven't fixed the underlying issue which is that we have no industries, no interest in science & technology, corrupt politicians and nepotism.

6524 2018-05-26 16:21:32 Next week's thought: china stocks explode $baba $bidu $vips $jd $momo probably due to $momo earning beat.

6525 2018-05-26 16:21:25 Astringent tu a solution yg bg temporary clean & fresh feeling to the skin sbb dia akn remove oil on skin's surface. Biasanya toner yg alcohol tinggi tu lah kita kategorikan sbg astringent. Kalau nk natural alternative, witch hazel lah jawapannya, but it doesn't mean it's better.
6526 2018-05-26 16:21:21 My agenda today is simple - take advantage of the day and make art. I’ll be working on a small oil painting and probably a glass of wine later. What are you into today? #artist #dosomething

6542 2018-05-26 16:20:20 Oh well, Let me wash my hair, then oil it, you know moisturize.  Then I'll do either 2 or 4 French braids then slap my wig on.

6548 2018-05-26 16:19:37 Just read @Phumlani_Kango's piece in @AttitudeMag. Kinda sad that after 23 years, despite best efforts, things down south are turning around as slowly as an oil tanker... but glad that people like Phumlani are around and positive influences.

6561 2018-05-26 16:18:04 Is the issue that the objective is create captive markets e.g. with patented terminator seeds? In the 1950s two extractive agri-interventions failed; The Groundnut Scheme (TZ) and the Gambian Poultry Scheme. The Gnut scheme was to satisfy a global post-War veg. oil shortage.

Truck drivers (brainwashed by media) helped to overthrow Dilma #Rousseff at a time when oil was roughly half the price it is today.

6574 2018-05-26 16:16:00 Nice. I got out of $XOP already. It was frustrating me. Haha. 
But who would’ve thought this move. Seemed as if crude oil was unstoppable
6575 2018-05-26 16:15:56 Trump should: 
Force US companies to increase production, while forcing citizens & companies to decrease demand. 
Then convince OPEC to increase output by either selling them arms, helping them to take over some other oil prdcing counties, or threaten OPEC w military action!

6597 2018-05-26 16:13:46 Look at Rockefeller, Carnegie, Vanderbilt, all of those family are still in control & the wealthiest, then they married into Royalty from other countries. Bush started in the Texas oil business n he’s a multimillion, with help from higher up. They are all in cahoots.

Petrobras which once delivered subsized oil for #Brazilians would now follow international prices. 
After all, after shale gas, gas prices were very low. Nothing could go wrong, right? wrong.

6615 2018-05-26 16:11:55 Rs 6 lakh cr is the bonanza the #Modi govt reaped from lower global oil prices during its tenure. It could’ve educated 50 cr more children, quadrupled no. of public hospitals or bought three times more equipment for #jawans #4yearsofModi #Army

The incumbent "president" (Temer - the puppet) and his sponsors in practice is dwarfing Petrobras (the #Brazilian oil company), piece by piece and changed the rules. 
They put executives (insiders) representatives of concurrent international oil giants to help run the company.
6633 2018-05-26 16:09:46 Because the film business is as nonpartisan as the oil business that also enjoys a hefty tax credit that they sell to other Louisiana businesses to reduce their tax bills.

6636 2018-05-26 16:09:30 Why the GOV is unwilling to cut the petrol&diesel prices #FuelPriceHike
1) America's exit from Iran nuclear deal & imposing sanctions as over 80%of crude oil is imported which makes India a contingent of imports.
2) Venezuela's supply shortage due to ageing infrastructure...

6679 2018-05-26 16:05:37 Relate with this thing:
 1) OPEC countries have an aim to take oil price to 80 dollar/barrel. so the buying price will increase more 2) Rupee will fall wrt dollar  so buying will increase more etc. So GOI is recovering the upcoming loss by charging >100% tax.

6687 2018-05-27 23:59:28 The only real trick is that he braises herbs in soysauce overnight. You do that (or just sub a tiny sprinkle of fresh 5spice when you cook), and make FRESH chili oil of your own, and the rest is just like any recipe you’ve seen, with weird portions.

6706 2018-05-27 23:59:37 If you dump 8,700 gallons of used oil in to a fucking storm drain thats 300 yards from protected marsh lands you are a complete fucking waste of skin. Thanks to him, it made got to the marsh and is now an ecological fucking holocaust 100 yds nead our water reservoir.
6707 2018-05-27 23:59:28 The only real trick is that he braises herbs in soysauce overnight. You do that (or just sub a tiny sprinkle of fresh 5spice when you cook), and make FRESH chili oil of your own, and the rest is just like any recipe you’ve seen, with weird portions.
6708 2018-05-27 23:59:04 He's a cunt! Went 2 his restaurant once, only because I won a meal there - it was shit! The food was swimming in grease and oil, the steak was 80% fat, the side dishes came with bowls of oil to dip in, the puddings were nice high in calories & sugar full sugar drinks were aplenty

tossing MM's americans modest oil royalties

You need to be quiet... forever.
6726 2018-05-27 23:56:49 Try egg noodles with shrimp or gyros.  Pretty easy to make too.  Boil noodles in water.  In a pan add olive oil and let it heat a little then add tomatoes, red onion, and other veggies you want.  In a separate pan add gyros and make them simmer a little. Combine all. Enjoy
6727 2018-05-27 23:56:28 They were carpaccio. Lightly seasoned with rose oil and if I recall, honey. Truly a taste like no other.
6728 2018-05-27 23:56:26 Only .1% directly employed in the oil business. I am not talking about oil workers' girlfriends or wives or escorts who get a trickle down pay

6730 2018-05-27 23:56:02 Wanna bet he likes to be drizzled in extra virgin olive oil?
6731 2018-05-27 23:56:01 EXACTLY this. I always have olive oil, garlic, basil and Italian parsley. Always.
6732 2018-05-27 23:55:07 As best we could. I think he got into oil on a farm somewhere. Bathing a sedated gbear in the woods is not a simple task...and would require a lot of dawn. 6 months later (now) he’s hiking over entire mtn ranges looking for females so he’s doing OK.

6742 2018-05-27 23:53:24 That is a HUGE ask.  The country is run by lobbyists..big money..that is interested in war, oil and Wall Street and now OWN our elected people. They are not going to give up their power easily.  Trump has done what they want.  Americans don't pay attention until they are dying.
6743 2018-05-27 23:53:17 I heard lavender oil helps with dark spots 
6744 2018-05-27 23:53:16 This is what passes for a U.S Sen. from OR. Ron we don’t buy oil from Iran. Eight years of Obama left our refineries behind oil capacity to convert due to Obam’s “War on Carbon.” So new permits were rejected. Plus I thought libs loved high gas prices? Something about pedal power?

6746 2018-05-27 23:53:00 Of course the damages have to be mitigated. But change can’t be controlled by humans no matter how much you reduce gas and oil use.

6751 2018-05-27 23:52:13 So I guess you already cut your gas line to your house and stop using any government welfare as it’s fund by selling canadian oil.

6754 2018-05-27 23:51:25 Price in NW IN has gone up over a dollar in less than 6 months. It’s $3.15 a gallon now and have the 3rd largest oil refinery in the country here.
6755 2018-05-27 23:51:23 "Cor! You do weekly maintenance?" He asked, "Mind if I cheat on the dings? I don't have proper tools here. You'll have to paint 'er yourself as I'm completely colourblind." Tartarus chuckled, "I had an elderly woman come in, been driving three years, no oil change. Poor beast."-
6756 2018-05-27 23:51:15 Also, oil troll.
6757 2018-05-27 23:51:10 Have you been following this whole thing?? It’s pretty clear he is continuing to refer to the oil and gas industry. Consistent with his prior comments.
6758 2018-05-27 23:51:06 All I’m saying is it’s a good thing I got rid of that ceramic owl oil lamp cos I sang to it way too much
6759 2018-05-27 23:50:57 This ‘Great’ democracy has serious structural issues if it can be taken down by a not too bright snake oil salesman and liar.

6764 2018-05-27 23:49:57 Horse sh%t.  They rise every Memorial Day as a function of bipartisan gouging for summer vacation season.  Otherwise you're the one fighting oil and gas extraction every way you can, driving prices up and disadvantaging us in the global market.

6770 2018-05-27 23:49:27 We don't know how fast tech is developing here or in other nations. I think a lot gets suppressed. US gets cheap debt 2 finance wars from sale of oil in US $. That is now under threat.

They're in tatters thanks to higher interest rates, gas prices & inflation. Thanks Trump. People vote their pocket books; you're in trouble.
6776 2018-05-27 23:48:49 I'm not saying to expect an oil refinery terror attack. I'm say the planning for one that would serve a #Putin strategic contingency has been drawn up. If the appropriate military conditions present themselves, that might be a timing oriented covert op he'd attempt.
6777 2018-05-27 23:48:40 Today only for memorial day buy 1  1000mg cbd oil get one free good till midnight only
6778 2018-05-27 23:48:32 You're an idiot. Opec has cut production to drive up prices and it's memorial day weekend and gas prices always are inflated during the travel months.And I'm sure you didn't notice that crude oil prices fell to just over 67 a barrel last week. I didn't think so.
6779 2018-05-27 23:48:23 Any  idea since WE built a refinery? 1977!

You want cheap gas? You want Islamites to play ball? You want to make the AMERICANS IN CHICAGO reevaluate the price of fuel?

6788 2018-05-27 23:47:00 So... someone knocked over a barrel and spilled half. The facility is made for spills to happen they have geotextiles under the ground to prevent oil seepage into the ground. This is ridiculous fear mongering at its finest.

6795 2018-05-27 23:45:06 agreed! every single used one i’ve looked at leaks oil

6798 2018-05-27 23:44:36 Again: the "Conservative" Harris govt grew Ontario's debt from $90.7B - $132.6 and the Harper govt increased Canada's national debt by $176+B DURING PEAK OIL PRICES. Don't tell me Conservatives know how to handle any economy!
6799 2018-05-27 23:44:21 Snake  oil is all I heard when he talked.
6800 2018-05-27 23:44:14 There is such a delicate timing to it. I also have the impression that the amount of oil that I use is never ideal (either too little or too much!). Often times, my rice ends up being too sticky, too! That crispy crust in the picture is so mouthwatering. I'll try this recipe!
6801 2018-05-27 23:43:38 And smelt of patchouli oil.
6802 2018-05-27 23:43:38 Dad: You got an oil change & a full tank.. you’re welcome

Mom: I gave you three kids.. you’re welcome
6803 2018-05-27 23:43:37 Talking points. How original of you. Did Dems ever do anything to reduce oil prices other than give billions to terrorists?
6804 2018-05-27 23:43:35 Basically ina day! Cause my phone bill, oil change, and spend money in Walmart that I wasn’t suppose to spend
6805 2018-05-27 23:43:28 So say my mutual funds invested in oil.
6806 2018-05-27 23:43:19 Go and find the international crude oil price. Crude oil price was higher in 2012 than now. And ask your BJP govt to file cases.. lol

6808 2018-05-27 23:42:41 When I'll go to college I'm sure I'll get texts from my aunt saying "don't forget to put some oil on top of the potatoes/falafels before you bake them or they won't crisp up!!!!" 
6809 2018-05-27 23:42:35 oil companies , drug companies , the nra , weapons  makers ,
6810 2018-05-27 23:42:09 I’m curious if that’s more or less than the oil in ship bilge dumped into Vancouver harbour, daily.
6811 2018-05-27 23:42:06 He lied about the Iran deal being “terrible”. He pulled out of the Iran deal & is implementing sanctions to stop their oil supply from coming to the market.  This raises the profits for Russia & Saudi.  Luckily for The US Europe of once again holding the line.
6812 2018-05-27 23:41:59 Yeah....because all our oil comes from Iran....what a moron. Trump derangement syndrome strikes again.
6813 2018-05-27 23:41:27 My mom has holy oil from Israel and it was in the kitchen and I thought it was regular oil and I used it to make my eggs and now she's looking for it idk what to do.....telling her is not an option lol

6819 2018-05-27 23:40:15 The reason I mention an oil refinery terror attack, is one would expect such an event to be among the timing related covert contingencies #Putin has drawn up already in the file cabinet; awaiting an appropriate set of operant factors 2 push it to the logistical planning forefront

6831 2018-05-27 23:39:06 Wind it at least once a month.  Other wise the mineral oil used to lubricate it hardens. Service every five years. If you need a watchmaker I know one.
6832 2018-05-27 23:38:42 Slight pushback:  It's not always easy to recognize an unnecessary war.  Iraq 2 certainly was one.  But what if Hussein had control of Kuwait's & SA oil supply?
  Also, would the U.S. j the world be in a better position if Putin & China filled whatever vacuum we left?
6833 2018-05-27 23:38:23 Thank you! I followed up the mask with pure coconut oil to moisturize. I’ve turned into a total skincare nerd lately 
6834 2018-05-27 23:38:13 The ONLY reason ballooning national debt doesn’t cripple and devalue the dollar, is that the greenback is the worlds reserve currency. When oil trade no longer requires the ‘petro-dollar’ we face a crisis that will define our generation. This above all dictates US foreign policy
6835 2018-05-27 23:38:10 More profit to oil companies?? I wish...then the share prices would increase, as would my retirement fund. Sadly that's not the case. Unfortunately no pipelines means one market for these guys to sell to, at a heavily discounted price. Remember, we all (in)directly own shares...

6838 2018-05-27 23:37:12 The Russians are drilling the oil, the Chinese are drilling the oil, the US is drilling the oil, countries in the middle east are drilling the oil. And yet we are the ones who have to abstain #ONdebate
6839 2018-05-27 23:37:10 it might be a hair product you’re using so try to see if anything new is bothering u. also excessive amounts of stress cause hairfall too so beware. and try using coconut oil in ur hair once a week and see if that helps with strength and regrowth. the water might be too hot too
6840 2018-05-27 23:37:08 i also have combination skin, w oily t-zone. i used neutrogena oil free pink grapefruit moisturizer. it’s like 7-10 dollars & it doesn’t leave your face feeling sticky. i’ve been using it for the past few months and i love it
6841 2018-05-27 23:36:55 Lol yes I’m knowing now , he was spraying some oil on it  i was shook because dude was skin bald and came out 360 like huh ?
6842 2018-05-27 23:36:54 Since moving to NYC in late 1980 and seeing him on a news show.  My first thought was, who is this snake oil salesman?  Vowed never to buy or visit anything with his name on it.  The sleaze bag has repelled me for 37 years.

6850 2018-05-27 23:35:53 Why have gas prices soared since we are fracking? Oil milestone: Fracking fuels half of U.S. output
6851 2018-05-27 23:35:31 I bought geranium essential oil today bc I deserved it and also I was sad

6854 2018-05-27 23:35:17 Wow. I was told a few days ago to dab lavender oil to my temples and to the base of my neck for fevers and to calm me down. I was told when I thought I had put on enough, do it all again. Oh my.
6855 2018-05-27 23:35:16 I’ll be proudfis you mention the term Climate Change! As in “how can insane once in a 1000 year floods happen so often? Is it Gods will or climate change caused by humans consuming oil? “
6856 2018-05-27 23:35:07 Only slight exception is Norwegian Americans who do not have their oil wealth to rely on, but still have a 3% higher standard of living than their native Norwegian cousins.
6857 2018-05-27 23:34:58 Do you mean those who fought for the greedy oil industries? Since the Ottomans, war has always been about oil and nothing more. Our love ones are the ones busting their asses because these greedy CEOs can't do it on their damn own. If they want oil so bad, they should go to war
6858 2018-05-27 23:34:54 And increase oil production in competition with Russia dropping energy prices; shoot down Russian planes in Syria; supply Ukrainians with firepower against Russia; back out of Iran deal that benefited Russia;  boot out more Russian diplomats than any other Pres, EVER!  Etc

6860 2018-05-27 23:34:27 Ahhhh quit your whining. You've never done nothing about big oil before. #Shill
6861 2018-05-27 23:34:06 What an idiot! A Trump pump? How did  this buffoon ever get elected? Oil prices are rising because OPEC agreed to extend production cuts through 2018. On November 30, 2016, the organization first agreed to cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day (mbpd) starting January 2017
6862 2018-05-27 23:34:02 Not so sure about the “unknowningly” part.
6863 2018-05-27 23:34:00 Im sorry guys it looks like i ruined my laptop with oil , just my luck ofc , i owe you a shower show another day
6864 2018-05-27 23:33:55 Cannabis oil wouldn’t pop positive on a drug test as it has super low (if any) amounts of THC anyway though, right??
6865 2018-05-27 23:33:44 have you tried flaxseed or fish oil or supplementing in general..

 an oil man, ladies and gentlemen. I have numerous concerns spread across this state. I have many wells flowing at many thousand barrels per day. I like to think of myself as an oil man.
6869 2018-05-27 23:33:07 Coconut oil mixed with tea tree oil is a great way to treat razor burn, just so ya know 
6870 2018-05-27 23:33:05 What picture hangs on the wall of every Texas oil and gas engineer?
6871 2018-05-27 23:32:55 and even global entities:  the United States (a global defender), the United Nations (a global ally) and Iran (an enemy that controlled a resource, oil, which has a global impact)...
6872 2018-05-27 23:32:50 I expect OPEC will continue to talk down oil prices until June 22nd.  Short term pain, long term gain.
6873 2018-05-27 23:32:49 Go hide in your bunker, turn up Fox, order a double shot of Kool aide, oil your guns, thump your bible, speak in tongues, you are willfully ignorant.

6877 2018-05-27 23:32:12 Agree. But you might want to separate yourself from that particular op-ed. The dismissal of EV technology and lauding of oil made it sound like @Shell paid @nytimes for the column.
6878 2018-05-27 23:31:58 Dip it in seasoned olive oil, Yashar!
6879 2018-05-27 23:31:32 The nine year boy in me still snickers at it when I hear it. I also loved God Shammgod, Oil Can Boyd, World B. Free, Picabo Street, and of course Dick Butkus. Ha ha ha.
6880 2018-05-27 23:30:55 Doug Ford called fixing Climate Change a scam. While he drives his big SUV, he has no clue about solutions proven by scientists. He's protecting Oil Giants and big Corps again.  #ONdebate

I would think the OIL CARTEL has more to do with it

Also, this idea of supply and demand

6885 2018-05-27 23:30:30 It's only a one time thing,  just like with bicycle manufacturing.  It only takes oil to make them but no oil is used by them after that for their entire service run.  

That's the difference between using only a few barrels of oil and using ten's of thousands of barrels.
6886 2018-05-27 23:30:29 Hey @fordnation, know what I think impacts higher gasoline prices more than carbon tax? Unconstrained, free market capitalism.  You know, your friends in Big Oil.  Buy what do I know.

6888 2018-05-27 23:30:14 no they are not - some of the wealthiest countries in the world....OIL and what is the constitutional requirement to be President?
6889 2018-05-27 23:30:01 Was this run through the relay system? Does it do a charge cycle? hooked through the oil pressure sensor?
6890 2018-05-27 23:30:00 No force involved therefore just more profit to oil companies. Lowering tax does not lower price. Naive.
6891 2018-05-27 23:29:54 Thanks! I converted to beard oil/balm this time around :D (Trying to get the moustache to grow enough to put a little wax on it and style it. Not necessarily a handlebar though.)
6892 2018-05-27 23:29:53 Do oil changes on the older ones also cost $5k? That could get me motivated to turn the wrenches again myself!
6893 2018-05-27 23:29:51 Because N.Ireland dont have oil...
As long as they can keep squandering the oil wealth, they will do all they can to keep Scotland within reach of their sticky fingers.
They dnt give a F**k about the good friday agreement, but they do care if Scotland leaves & takes its oil  bk

6903 2018-05-27 23:28:54 I wouldn’t eat anything on the street that I didn’t see come hot off the grill or out of boiling oil. I ate pastels at the National Stadium, didn’t see spring rolls. Nems were at some restaurants but not everywhere
6904 2018-05-27 23:28:48 That's what make's a club special. We earned our's, you didn't. 3007. Lottery winners. 8 1 before the oil come in. Never forget.

6906 2018-05-27 23:28:37 One doesn't work in English, only in German :( the other is: the wick of an oil lamp is too short to reach into the oil. You don't have any oil, what do you do?
6907 2018-05-27 23:28:31 Would Guardiola be managing City without the oil money?
6908 2018-05-27 23:28:24 Just as well Trump doesn’t believe in global warming. Let’s stoke up the coal industry. The Arms industry. Let’s allow pipelines of crude oil flow. In ten years water will be the greatest commodity.

6910 2018-05-27 23:28:21 Scotland can't borrow, so no debt. Only country in the world to find oil..that was bad, Westmonster won't pay bedroom tax yet you idiots think we swallow the lie they'll subsidise a country
6911 2018-05-27 23:28:06 We work in oil & gas industries.  Most employers sew the American flag into your lab coats/nomex.

Appealing to Patriots has always been a lucrative part of the NFL's costumer base, which also helps pay player's large figures. Will be interesting to see how this all pans out.
6912 2018-05-27 23:28:04 i don’t give a shit how much better organic peanut butter is for you if I wanted to see that much oil before I made a pb&j id just rub my greasy ass face on the bread
6913 2018-05-27 23:27:48 I love it when kids who are softer than Q-tips dipped in baby oil act tough
6914 2018-05-27 23:27:43 No you can’t blame Trump for the gas prices. Several States have raised the Gas Tax & OPEC has decreased production. It happens all the time. The Ebb and Flow of Oil.
6915 2018-05-27 23:27:38 No shortage of oil.  The companies share holders just want more of the people's $.
6916 2018-05-27 23:27:31 I remember when the price of gas was 1.40L and a barrel of oil was $140. Why then are we paying 1.37L when a barrel of oil is under $60?!
6917 2018-05-27 23:27:28 Hell that's damn good milage. Beats cars on just one tank of gas. Car manufacturers can make very fuel efficent cars but won't because oil industry is in a conspriacy to not devlelop those engines.
6918 2018-05-27 23:27:14 Or even worse with all ur oil millions still made no impression on the champions league 
6919 2018-05-27 23:27:06 I got an oil change, cooked lunch and paid some bills today. Adulting at its finest.
6920 2018-05-27 23:27:06 @IBeHoopin_44 tap in where da oil at
6921 2018-05-27 23:27:01 So basically it's good for oil bosses even if it doesn't generate as many jobs as renewable energy does? Come off it.
6922 2018-05-27 23:26:57 It is  you do have to keep an eye on it pending on the oil you use Veg or canola will fry it fast before thicker parts are done I always recommend evoo.  But yeah I'm full of secrets from the production kitchen also like you I'm an opportunistic cook and make with what I have.
6923 2018-05-27 23:26:56 And what would it have been if it had happened before trump? Obama(not)care? Bush-oil-war-incarceration? A Clinton internship? :P
6924 2018-05-27 23:26:50 Easy to see why crude oil matters so much to America. Country so big, public transport not so good. On many levels, if you don't have your own car, e don be for you.
6925 2018-05-27 23:26:40 Nothing wrong with TdF finish, as the racing is full on when they get on the champs. I guess there is always a risk if it rains on city centre races, as roads are dangerous with oil, fuel residue. Don't want TT or TTT though, as dull spectacle.
6926 2018-05-27 23:26:30 Just woke up from the fattest nap and remembered I got myself shoes and an oil diffuser life is good 
6927 2018-05-27 23:26:29 It's not those prices in TX We have a beautiful state & great Senators

Maybe Sen. Wyden as a Democrat u have failed ur state"On my watch, we're not going 2 have a bunch of new policies that allow us 2 in effect, be forced 2 see oil derricks when we're looking out Haystack Rock"

6931 2018-05-27 23:25:53 Hard to make a case for increased migrations, raised standards of living and consumption of resources in light of this.
6932 2018-05-27 23:25:43 There is currently 11MM b/d of heavy crude refined globally. Will that number grow as global oil production expands to 2040? Don't know. Given the problems in Mexico and Venezuela it's hard to say if AB will displace existing, take new markets, or combination.
6933 2018-05-27 23:25:40 Only difference I ever noticed was the smell of oil vs. the smell of planes
6934 2018-05-27 23:25:38 my mom bought me an oil burner with s lavender scent for my room and i have been feeling sooooooo relaxed all day  #queen
6935 2018-05-27 23:25:20 永遠の花最高やんけ
6936 2018-05-27 23:25:15 The price of oil is driven by speculators looking to make a quick buck. They would drive up the price based on a news release announcing that an Arab farted in the desert.
6937 2018-05-27 23:24:52 @fordnation has no idea what earning minimum wage is about yet those are the folks they are selling their snake oil to.
6938 2018-05-27 23:24:45 Why are they not regulated by Department of Energy.  They change price at the pump when price of oil changes before it's even produced. Making huge profits. They raise it fast but lower super slow. Then there's the scammer foreign run gas stations with charging more for credit.
6939 2018-05-27 23:24:31 where is so i use really i am fucking oil
6940 2018-05-27 23:24:25 Why are they rallying in Montreal? Is the pipeline supposed to bring Saudi oil from the St Lawrence through Canada to BC?
6941 2018-05-27 23:23:52 neutrogena grapefruit oil free acne wash !! i use it and it works soo good

6944 2018-05-27 23:23:32 Oil companies are very quick to raise prices for any reason but slow as a slug to lower them it seems like
6945 2018-05-27 23:23:32 Black mom vs. content me sitting on the sofa : oil vs. water
6946 2018-05-27 23:23:30 Don’t gas prices always rise this time of year as we head into summer travel, when your laws @RonWyden force oil refiners to chemically alter the blend for environmental reasons? You must think we are stupid and blame the President for your regs!
6947 2018-05-27 23:23:30 @BigAlpha favorite oil plays?....
6948 2018-05-27 23:22:50 Oil on the fact anzac day isn't our national 'these fucking idiots shouldn't be allowed on a mission, whereas I was always at.
6949 2018-05-27 23:22:40 Oil isn’t necessary it’s an old form of fuel and we should be making moves towards relying on it less and less
6950 2018-05-27 23:22:31 My dad bought a 57 dollar bottle of  olive oil and my mom hasn’t spoken to him since . .

6954 2018-05-27 23:21:56 Mike. I was thinking instead of going after suppliers of resources like oil&gas or coal. Why don’t you protest against consumers. Like you should put protesters at every gas station in Canada.
6955 2018-05-27 23:21:55 Been thinking about him lately.He is so destructive and unhinged,plus I live in RI and was here when he was a snake oil salesman and robbed us blind.Yet also remember his crusade against skin cancer with his wife and their book about parenting an autistic child.

6959 2018-05-27 23:21:03 People saying that 100 L isn’t a lot and “I put more then that into my car/truck haha” you do understand that this isn’t gasoline right? This is crude oil, or for some of you that don’t understand unrefined petroleum. This is where Alberta shows us how it would deal with a spill.
6960 2018-05-27 23:20:53 It's an entire oil painting, not a shirt
6961 2018-05-27 23:20:36 Absolutely not a fan of Pauline Hanson but she is correct on one thing.  They need to fix the oil and gas resource tax as its not working like it should.  Another example of this government just allowing the big end of town to pocket money at the expense of government services.
6962 2018-05-27 23:20:34 That somewhat contradicts the contention that AB oil would 'displace' worse oil, since that oil is declining anyway. If we don't add our oil, the world will have to learn to use less, which is what is absolutely essential.
6963 2018-05-27 23:20:27 Energy consumption if 110W per mile is close to Electric Motorcycle!

Remember,  it takes about 4 KW of Energy to Refine Oil and Produce just 1 Gallon of Gas. 

4000W / 110W = 36 Miles of Pure Electric Range with this Model 3 Without Burning a Gallon of Fuel

Small 100 litre oil spill by @KM_Canada. Shouldn't take too long to clean up. If @RachelNotley @WBrettWilson @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna & @Bill_Morneau all leave their houses now, they should be able to clean this up by tomorrow.

6973 2018-05-27 23:19:08 This is misinformation. 

Line 9 is to tide water. 

In total we got 1.2mm+  bbls/day of take away capacity completed under the Harper gov't which virtually eliminated the differential on light oil

So far under the Liberals it's more cancelled than approved but they're trying
6974 2018-05-27 23:18:58 Tech money > Oil Money 

These Tech giants are going to explode
6975 2018-05-27 23:18:45 Well don't declare pointless wars in the Middle East for some oil. Problem solved
6976 2018-05-27 23:18:39 it cooks food like a fryer but with less oil hahaha.
6977 2018-05-27 23:18:36 Maybe stop comparing countries that have populations under 10 million with the U.S  Norway has massive oil reserves that allow them to distribute wealth on a small scale. Population 5.5 million. You’re comparing apples and onions.

6979 2018-05-27 23:18:27 Take olive oil or spam and spray the shit out of it. Then put the bbq on full blast for 5 mins which will help with the cleaning...
6980 2018-05-27 23:18:10 More coconut oil
6981 2018-05-27 23:18:08 If only people had told them...
6982 2018-05-27 23:18:02 Id rather have that than an layer of oil and grease back when I worked in the deli
6983 2018-05-27 23:17:52 avene therma water, bioderma micellar water, nuxe oil, la roche posay products too, but mostly avene cold cream lipbalm its heaven for soft lips
6984 2018-05-27 23:17:44 Imagine if we cared when it was “free money” to oil companies or banks that also pay very little in taxes....when its for the people ...no fuckin way do we give them “free anything”

6989 2018-05-27 23:16:32 Global oil prices are not controlled by Canadian governments. No amount of wishful thinking is going to change that.
6990 2018-05-27 23:16:32 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.
6991 2018-05-27 23:16:31 The tanning oil said it had some sunscreen in it
6992 2018-05-27 23:16:24 Neutrogena body oil is the shit , it’s the perfect summer oil. Thank me later
6993 2018-05-27 23:16:24 We natural beauty!One of our favorite natural beauty tips is to use coconut oil as a natural replacement for shaving cream! Coconut oil is ultra-hydrating and allows for a close shave without razor burn or irritation! 
Do you have a favorite natural beauty tip?
6994 2018-05-27 23:16:14 I cannot believe the @OntarioPCParty had such a slam dunk of an election and instead they elected this former hash dealer, huckster, used car and snake oil salesman. He’s just a big smiling dummy up there parroting figures his staff gave him because he has NO FUCKING CLUE.
6995 2018-05-27 23:16:10 @daniloconversi Theresa May priminister have you got the balls to stand up to the greedy bastard oil companies that are put the oil prices up every day we need a Tory government  that will stand up for what you believe in
6996 2018-05-27 23:16:04 What a jackass.  I hope they all have the guts to register Republican.
6997 2018-05-27 23:15:54 Mia casa,  pasta with home grown tomato sauce, meatballs, salad with oil cured olives & marinated artichokes some Italian artisan bread ...and a bottle of homemade vino Tutti a tavola a mangiare! 
6998 2018-05-27 23:15:42 Oh god I can't listen to Sawbones because I ONLY listened to it on my morning shifts at work and now it reminds me of the very specific feeling of opening the place, changing oil and cutting tomatoes.
6999 2018-05-27 23:15:15 Of course, given past performance on reporting oil spills, there is no guarantee that the actual amount spilled isn't more than that.
7000 2018-05-27 23:15:10 It’s a joke is what it is, bite the hand that feeds, handcuff a resource that supports national economy......but import foreign oil
7001 2018-05-27 23:14:48 But much like nuclear waste, a lot of it is recycled. This report is primarily on a single company who have been skirting the regulations. There is no denying that all forms of emission free aren’t problematic. But they’re better than the alternatives like coal, oil or gas.
7002 2018-05-27 23:14:31 I figured you guys have to do something to protect yourselves. My family is Greek and we all have holy oil, water, and sanctified crosses, icons that protect our homes. And we don't even do ghost investigations.
7003 2018-05-27 23:14:30 Lewis and his squeeze are intransigent fools. They would wipe out all oil wealth overnight. They are the enemy.
7004 2018-05-27 23:14:27 The squeaky wheel gets the oil, but the noisy bird gets the stone.

7011 2018-05-27 23:13:34 bottles of oil balk at the thought of it; mops balk at the thought of it; therefore mops are bottles of oil
7012 2018-05-27 23:13:33 Mexican heavy is in long-term decline, has been for 20 years. Venezuela is imploding and its oil production fell off a cliff. So, market space for Canadian heavy. Plus rapidly growing Asian demand opening up new markets. Global oil demand: 2018 = 100MM b/d 2040 = 117MM b/d - IEA

7015 2018-05-27 23:12:54 You're white right? So you descend from all white people who came to this continent to loot & still continue to mine it dry. Incite wars on Africa's children to sow divisions for gains of gold, uranium, diamonds, oil... so yeah your forefathers!
7016 2018-05-27 23:12:50 Doug Ford is talking about how Conservative Govts reduce debt and he cites the Mike Harris govt who increased Ontario's debt from $90.7B - $132.6B during his "Common Sense Revolution." Then there's Stephen Harper who drove up the Nat debt by $150B during peak oil prices.

7021 2018-05-27 23:12:09 I'm thinking @3coltshandicap sounds slightly like the Monticello caller Howard Oil, a bit in calling style and in sound.  Not sure if Howard still callin em there.
7022 2018-05-27 23:12:02 I love tea tree oil so much because my scars began to fade ohhhh clear skin before eid
7023 2018-05-27 23:11:54 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
7024 2018-05-27 23:11:54 Hey Ian, Pls.  find out why Ont. didn't seek out Musk Rat Falls Hydro & demand it flow thru Quebec....like Alberta oil thru BC.  to rescue rate payers? vs. shipping it east to an imaginary market & @ exorbitant costs to those receiving it?

7026 2018-05-27 23:11:35 We interrupt Mike Hudema's regularly scheduled hysteria for non-sensational  facts.

1. Release was less than 100 litres of oil - about 2 engine oil changes on a Freightliner semi

2. Release entirely contained on KM's facility

3. Facility is 1km away from North Thompson River
7027 2018-05-27 23:11:32 I thought it was snake oil when I first read about it 3+ years ago.  The first few times I tried it I got some poor quality stuff that did nothing.
7028 2018-05-27 23:11:28 Tea sis. I'll take Mariah or Britney over Dula Peep and Canola Oil any day.
7029 2018-05-27 23:11:28 This is eerily similar to the gulf oil spill.. and that was a total shit show. I’m praying for sure
7030 2018-05-27 23:11:23 M80 + oil drum = 60 foot tall fireball
7031 2018-05-27 23:11:21 Well. If BC ppl can start walking to commute then oil is not neccessary. Then why would you building a jet oil ppl in richmond? BC is part of Canada and there is no doubt a ppl should built.
7032 2018-05-27 23:11:00 Kinder Morgan were right. Oil spills do create jobs.

7035 2018-05-27 23:10:40 Why Venezuela is falling it is the oil economy.
So what Trump is doing would make us like Venezuela's economy.
7036 2018-05-27 23:10:35 Saudi Arabia realizes that if the Democrats take Congress, support for Saudi actions would diminish substantially. Also, very high oil prices help Iran more than anyone else. It would also allow Iran to intensify its assistance to its proxies in Yemen.

7038 2018-05-27 23:10:29 Your reckless reporting is false.  We have so much oil that we export it.
7039 2018-05-27 23:10:29 Overpriced oil does not help.
Previously there was almost no direct foreign investment (8% of all capital inflows in RF, 90% loans) to the Russian economy, and now also hot speculative capital evacuated against the backdrop of tightening sanctions and attenuation of the economy.
7040 2018-05-27 23:10:27 @fordnation sounds like a snake oil seller
7041 2018-05-27 23:10:26 I did, because I felt the truffle oil was an unnecessary addition. That’s Gwendolyn for you. She thinks she’s more elite than the rest of us.

7050 2018-05-27 23:09:28 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.

7059 2018-05-27 23:08:40 @fordnation we need a new oil refinery in this province

7062 2018-05-27 23:07:58 controversial take, perhaps, but my desert island foods would be: salt, onions, olive oil. On their own, or with an ingredient found on the island, that’s a dope meal right there

7082 2018-05-27 23:05:36 #Crude, the next movement will be tricky.  It can either go instant rebound or delay rebound. If Monday price continue go down, then it's delay rebound.  Then I can tell you the bottom. #oil #aramco

7090 2018-05-27 23:04:38 What u mean it’s not a lot bahah that’s a lot of oil.  These are the reasons why there isn’t going to be a pipeline.

7093 2018-05-27 23:04:17 China imports more semiconductors per year by value than it does crude oil. Guess at least it gets to re-export the semiconductors.

7106 2018-05-27 23:02:24 Finally, global oil prices crashed. But there were no measures put in place by the economy managers to initiate or adopt insulators as a guard against the inherent hardship that will follow.

7114 2018-05-27 23:01:31 Now with oil prices low&seen as old industry: SNP & Better Together self defeating argument was waste of words #IFF
7115 2018-05-27 23:01:20 Quick, look over your shoulder at tankers full of Nigerian, Venezuelan and Saudi oil plying the St Lawrence!  While you are busy opposing KM you are actively supporting the suppression of women’s rights and social equity. Look in the mirror and what do you see? Such a hypocrite.
7116 2018-05-27 23:00:48 The snake oil salesman is in full effect tonight. The smile hasn’t left his face. Please tell me that right wing thinkers can honestly see thru this pathetic act. #OntarioElection2018
7117 2018-05-27 23:00:46 Blend 3 pints Rice with 11 lbs elderberry. Add Olive Oil. Slice into 1 inch pieces. Serve for brunch
7118 2018-05-27 23:00:41 1/2 Why did it take Hussein 6 years to do absolutely NOTHING about ISIS!? and I guess you never took econ 101... As the economy improves more goods r sold n traded. What moves those goods? OIL! there4 in a GOOD economy there is greater demand for oil n prices go up! It's simple..

7123 2018-05-27 23:00:15 that oil spill is the gov of Alberta going to pay for the clean up
7124 2018-05-27 23:00:01 Well that's honey but I believe it applies for olive oil too! I occasionally cover my hands with olive oil before I go to sleep and they become very soft & my nails become shiny. I got that from nana lol
7125 2018-05-27 22:59:54 #BREAKING After years of dumping toxic oil waste Chevron could finally be pushed to clean up the Ecuadorian #Amazon! Shareholder @vanguard_uk could make it happen with a vote this week -- Sign & RT??? #Environment
7126 2018-05-27 22:59:40 I would describe my current mental state as lightly crispy, like a fish stick that’s been deep fried in hot oil
7127 2018-05-27 22:59:40 Just a snake oil salesman!&Ahole!
7128 2018-05-27 22:59:39 The facts are just that, the facts. This is the old snake oil salesmanship, yet again.
7129 2018-05-27 22:59:29 By entering the market with new oil, wouldn't we be depressing prices, thus increasing total consumption? There aren't any white hats in the fossil fuel business.
7130 2018-05-27 22:59:18 Put the phone down. Peppermint oil in a dark dark room. Cold compress.

Crude oil for them is not a sin
7132 2018-05-27 22:59:04 U ever just wanna go full minimalist? Use argan oil for everything and make your own toothpaste? Carve spoons out of bamboo for a living? I can smell the patchouli already
7133 2018-05-27 22:58:56 Me too! I use it for everything so I buy one big gallon and break it up into smaller containers for hair, cooking oil, butter, moisturizer, etc. Sweet pot fries are the best! I love to make my homemade biscuits with it. It gives it  a hint of sweetness.
7134 2018-05-27 22:58:48 Montrealers pay 40.00% more at the pump than everyone else. Quebec on a whole is at 39.00%.
In 2008, the price of a barrel of crude oil was roughly 140 ish... gas prices were 131~. Today gas prices are between 130-150 and the crude oil barrel is no where near 100$.

7137 2018-05-27 22:58:39 lol, you fool, oil in total is sweet piss all, 5% of the economy. We made as much money off of green tourism.
7138 2018-05-27 22:58:37 Oh yeah.... YOUR candidates  have some REAL different backgrounds, all right!   (Oil wrestling promoter, Hitler propagandist, Poppy hater....)

7142 2018-05-27 22:57:17 #Colombia - as the polls predicted Duque (capitalist, anti FARC deal) vs Petro (socialist, pro FARC deal) in June 17th round 2 for Presidential vote. Both will hope oil price stays high.
7143 2018-05-27 22:57:10 The thing is oil is toxic substance but yet everything you see in your life is made from it,. Until. Technology advances we will still be slowly killing our planet because there is no happy ending with petroleum
7144 2018-05-27 22:57:06 The secret to happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.
7145 2018-05-27 22:57:04 To put it in perspective, many mini Van's and 1/2 ton trucks have had tanks of 85 litres or more.  

An oil tank for your household furnace holds 900 litres. 
 
A tanker truck or railcar would be 10's of thousands of times more. 

So not much of a spill.
7146 2018-05-27 22:57:02 We are exporting more oil then Iran is producing. Moron, market is being manipulated
7147 2018-05-27 22:56:45 It's the Mexican in me, but I prefer my men uncured and soft, then rendered for their flavorful oil to be used to fry garlic and onions.  #perfectanalogy

7166 2018-05-27 22:54:32 Boost body lotion with baby oil If you're craving shiny legs that aren't greasy, blend a drop of baby oil into your normal body lotion.
7167 2018-05-27 22:54:32 I worked 8 hours, didn’t have a break, didn’t eat, had to clean up oil that other people spilled 3 times, and hit my head twice. So ya I guess u could say it was a good day
7168 2018-05-27 22:54:31 ชวนแล้วไม่ไปเอง
7169 2018-05-27 22:54:31 So we can’t recycle oil or plastic bags in Saskatoon?
7170 2018-05-27 22:54:17 I actually don’t believe he thinks his lies are real. If he appears that way, I believe it’s a facade. He’s a snake oil salesman. He’s a con. Giving that impression helps make it successful.
7171 2018-05-27 22:54:14 i was reading news about Colombia elections so i miss a short signal on my system for CLN8.

7174 2018-05-27 22:54:01 Is Nigeria still flaring its huge gas resource, for oil?
7175 2018-05-27 22:53:57 56% of Horwath's candidates are women: great.

Unfortunately, a good percentage are 9/11 Truthers, anti-Semites, oil wrestling aficionados and poppy-haters.
7176 2018-05-27 22:53:25 when you put on oil on your face jus before bed and it highlights the blemishes you thought you didnt have and that gives you jus enough anxiety so you can cry yourself to sleep

7181 2018-05-27 22:52:48 Not for Russian oil. Trump just made billions for them.
7182 2018-05-27 22:52:28 The cops raided his house and found 25 grams of hash oil. That's felony possession so they took his guns away.
7183 2018-05-27 22:52:24 can we just ship all spilt oil to some park in calgary where it will be appreciated?
7184 2018-05-27 22:52:21 They and their Labour/Lib Dem Unionist mates want their grubby hands on your oil, whisky, etc. It’s called greed. It’s an UK Ltd way of life and has been for centuries.

7189 2018-05-27 22:51:40 It might be interesting if you were as smart as you think you are.  The price of oil just went down.  Higher gas prices have nothing to do with the ridiculous Iran deal.  Maybe you could study the market to get smarter.
7190 2018-05-27 22:51:37 So true... I told my husband this relationship looked fake. I new it!!!It’s a city women and a country man, like oil and water. The more you stir, it just won’t mix.
7191 2018-05-27 22:51:06 Please do not body sweat/oil shame me
7192 2018-05-27 22:51:03 Been finding a mixture of herbal tinctures/extracts, vitamins, spices, mushroom extracts, and an omega oil has helped a bit with jumpstarting my focus but its not a long lasting effect... only 30min- 45min sadly. 

Cant wait to get looked over in July & hopefully get medicated.
7193 2018-05-27 22:51:03 Hey Doug... Gas prices surge and ebb on the whims of the oil industry. Hell, I get 5 cents off a litre for brand loyalty. You cut the 10 cents out that goes to the province the companies will jack it up again and we won't have road infrastructure. #ONdebate #onpoli
7194 2018-05-27 22:51:03 Went online today to schedule service for my car and I was asked where and when they can pick up my car. Valet service for an oil change might just be a game changer. Thanks @BMW_Motorwerks !!

7206 2018-05-27 22:49:55 Can i also Google the rationales behind cutting the oil production? For you id say Google a basic principle of demand and supply in economics when it comes to product pricing and you shall get a hint on where im coming from.
7207 2018-05-27 22:49:38 Yo, this week they tried to make fun of an NDP candidate for being a boxer and having promoted an oil wrestling league. You know, the paper with the half naked woman at the back in every damn issue

7210 2018-05-27 22:49:12 That's like the time I was coming up the Dan Ryan Expressway in Chicago at about midnight.  A truck in front of me dropped it's oil cooler which I hit and blew out both tires on the passenger side.

It was a long night.

7218 2018-05-27 22:48:26 Someone got bought! Invoking the plastic products we use to win us over is weak at best. Only ~16% of Petro production is used in products. And solar is cheaper than oil in many places now. Alberta too, with all our sun. #merchantoflies #propaganda
7219 2018-05-27 22:48:20 This will fall hard

7225 2018-05-27 22:47:54 Given the rhetoric it would be entirely reasonable, if they were permitted, for #alberta to cut off the transfer payments (billion$) they have made to #quebec for decades. I wonder how many of the people protesting know that their $10 daycare was paid for by #cdn oil?

7244 2018-05-27 22:45:28 The industrial revolution? Oil has existed before Canada’s oil sands... contrary to popular belief in Canada, the world does not need Alberta’s oil. Plenty coming from lower cost and more environmentally sound places in the world.

7249 2018-05-27 22:44:18 You can get PEM fuel cells on Amazon for about 50 us dollars. I have one, good stuff. If you combine that with solar, wind, hydro, and thorium based nuclear power, we won't need fossil fuels at all. Don't tell that to the oil cartels though.
7250 2018-05-27 22:44:14 From MS: "demand for oil products centres on middle distillates (jet fuel/kerosene, gasoil/diesel, and heating oil)... these products power heavy machinery and typically fuel industrial growth in emerging markets (EM)"

So an EM crash will slam oil 2x as much

7255 2018-05-27 22:43:53 Infiltration to Oil King, “Download Complete.” Can’t wait to see Oil King bring it back next tourney.
7256 2018-05-27 22:43:34 No it isnt!!! YOURE scared coz China is stepping in and Venezuela are sitting on the largest proven oil reserves on the planet and they are dropping the US dollar!!!
7257 2018-05-27 22:43:23 Everybody who buys Gas/Oil from #Russia are funding Putin!
7258 2018-05-27 22:43:20 Ummmm, WHAT?
7259 2018-05-27 22:43:19 Why do you think our oil rigs having been coming back from overseas for the past 6+ months? #waitforit
7260 2018-05-27 22:43:01 I blame bad tanning oil.
7261 2018-05-27 22:42:48 Despite the scoreline, really enjoyed that set between oil king and infiltration. And these two only just played last week in a top 8
7262 2018-05-27 22:42:40 Adjusting to the keto lifestyle has been interesting- butter and coconut oil in my coffee sounded crazy but, it’s kind of delicious.  Fat does NOT actually make you fat..... mind blown. 19 pounds and 8 percent body fat gone in a few months.
7263 2018-05-27 22:42:36 I was being sarcastic
7264 2018-05-27 22:42:33 Oil king out?
7265 2018-05-27 22:42:15 3-0 @INFILTRATION85 using Juri to knock out Oil King's Rashid. damn
7266 2018-05-27 22:42:05 Jill’s pool is officially re opened! And so is Jerry’s Garage for oil changes! 
7267 2018-05-27 22:41:31 You dip it in good vinegar and olive oil
7268 2018-05-27 22:41:27 Who do you trust with your money? - said the snake oil salesman #ONdebate
7269 2018-05-27 22:41:25 What I want to know is how just a few months back people were declaring the US would be the leader in the oil industry. Now our gas prices are high like this. Something isn’t adding up somewhere.
7270 2018-05-27 22:41:19 You understand the the crude oil marked about as we as you understand Chinese math!
7271 2018-05-27 22:41:18 indomaret aku juga yang oil beda
7272 2018-05-27 22:41:18 My mum heard on the news that England was to face water shortages in the future and she said to me “They better not think they are taking ours. Taking the oil was enough! They’re not having our water too!” 
7273 2018-05-27 22:41:12 He forgot the $5/gallon during obama's 1st term. If not for fracking opec will dominate the oil manipulations.
7274 2018-05-27 22:41:04 ...this is another reason to be suspicious of Breitbart. Putin appeared to be going against the globaliist agenda. He helped us a lot by bombing more than 500 lSIS oil trucks while 0bama was allowing them to run a lucrative oil refining business.
7275 2018-05-27 22:40:55 Onshore conventional oil discoveries has been none the last ten years,no discovery,no investment(No E No P)So the crude will get lighter in the future if shale oil is the only growth prospect,unless offshore and oil sands are returning. What is your view on Saudi spare capacity?

7278 2018-05-27 22:40:24 I tried that. I think b/c I smoke  regularly my body doesn’t even react to CBD oil. My body be like, “Quit playing and give me the real stuff.” 
7279 2018-05-27 22:40:12 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
7280 2018-05-27 22:39:53 I want someone that speaks it but I would prefer if it wasn’t the exact same. Like if I want my s.o. to get my oil changed because I have no time to do it, what if that’s the act of service they want as well??lol
7281 2018-05-27 22:39:32 Olive oil helped a bit.
7282 2018-05-27 22:39:29 Why am I now just finding out about cooking with coconut oil. I just ate the tastiest chicken I’ve ever had in my life. 
7283 2018-05-27 22:39:03 It's not a picture on the shirt + tee, apparently it's an oil painting
7284 2018-05-27 22:39:01 Oil King stop playing like me...
7285 2018-05-27 22:38:42 dip it in olive oil laced with garlic.
7286 2018-05-27 22:38:33 Crude oil

Rehypothetication
7287 2018-05-27 22:38:32 fingers all the way!! course there was this one time in Chicago and it was deep deep dish otherwise....fingers! licking off the salty oil is half the fun!! mmm
7288 2018-05-27 22:38:23 Actually better for your skin that way. Cold water closes the pores which were opened by the hot water,  therefore preventing loss of oil and keeping the skin firm

7290 2018-05-27 22:38:00 There was that one time, but we forgive you/don't talk about that.
7291 2018-05-27 22:37:51 Just noticed Oil King beat Sako before top 8....he’s cursed after combobreaker till EVO
7292 2018-05-27 22:37:45 i am waiting for my rose hip oil to absorb into my skin listening to bon iver n thinking of two beautiful blonde women god i’m living large aren’t i
7293 2018-05-27 22:37:42 Ma’am serve me pussy meat, i would like some coconut oil on top 
7294 2018-05-27 22:37:37 Trump family and cabinet bet big on oil going to $80 a barrel, making millions per sources. That why Trump is silent on oil and gas.. @nytimes @NYDailyNews @HuffPostPol @politico @thedailybeast @washingtonpost @latimes @maddow @joenbc @NicolleDWallace @chucktodd @kasie #Oil
7295 2018-05-27 22:36:37 Want to cripple Russia, lower oil prices by 50%... easy to do... drill, ship, refine in US & Canada.
7296 2018-05-27 22:36:34 sorry to hear that- sensitive skin on my end, and always try aloe vera on everything, first, because i don't react to it.  possibly tea tree oil could help, also.  would try in a small spot, first.
7297 2018-05-27 22:36:17 That's an odd statement considering we don't buy any oil from Iran. We produce more than the ME. You're argument holds no water.
7298 2018-05-27 22:36:10 They make the best fajitas and Burritto fillings. I like to make sure they are deboned and skinned, and then I grill them marinated in cilantro and lemon and olive oil.
7299 2018-05-27 22:36:08 You are right...it's fish oil
7300 2018-05-27 22:36:05 El primer ajuste fuiste vos, que te llevabas la de los impuestos al combustible que no garpaba oil
7301 2018-05-27 22:35:51 Can't wait till the UCP led rapid response team is in place and decisively refuting/correcting misinformation re the Cdn oil industry . Visions of the carnival game "Whack-A-Mole" - although not condoning violence of any kind
7302 2018-05-27 22:35:47 Back when we had someone we actually needed to fight.
Unlike all this Iraq afganistan bullshit set up by cowards just wanting control of the oil.
7303 2018-05-27 22:35:43 So far this weekend: my ABS brakes went out, my oil pan is leaking, and my transmission is going out. I also managed to crack my screen protector in 3 places without actually dropping my phone.
7304 2018-05-27 22:35:37 Going to get an oil change is like going to the doctors...you walk in needing medicine for a cold then you walk out dying 
7305 2018-05-27 22:35:25 Yg oil infused g diskon:(
7306 2018-05-27 22:35:16 The way the city and province handle the export of oil is all wrong freighters that come in to pick up oil must post a $5 million bond in cash and be put in the bank that will ensure the cleanup costs if there should be any,  are paid for by the company
7307 2018-05-27 22:35:16 And it all comes down to energy. Which means oil, as long as it lasts. Control energy = control everyone. While doing it, get filthy rich (or filthy in debt, which is the same thing), and play some #Golf. On your own premises, of course.
7308 2018-05-27 22:35:08 yg jelas face oil itu buat aku, sangaad melembabkan. malemnya pake, hbs yu bangun tidur, cuci muka, duh enak bgt
7309 2018-05-27 22:35:03 So sad that all the money generated from our oil and gas put together with other sectors for all these years was spent on  "Blame Projects".
Blame can be done without running for 2019.
APC please, leave Nigeria alone!
7310 2018-05-27 22:34:51 I'd start with a flat income tax of 15% for everyone earning over £20k. Simplify corporation tax so global companies can't cheat. Stop brexit. Cuts to parliamentarian salaries, expenses & office running costs; reduce number of voting constituencies. Stop oil&gas subsidies.
7311 2018-05-27 22:34:41 The unreported oil is rehypotheticated in London
7312 2018-05-27 22:34:33 @YourAlberta how are you going to spin todays oil spill? Let me guess, the spilled oil is a gift to the people of BC from our friends in the Oil Sands.
7313 2018-05-27 22:34:16 You get oil
7314 2018-05-27 22:34:12 Juri does very well against Rashid but Oil King still doesn't know this Matchup very well.
7315 2018-05-27 22:34:03 Leveraged oil for rehypothetication in London
7316 2018-05-27 22:33:56 Sweet butter child with your soft round cheeks and thick hair rich with the perfume of salt and oil. The smell of clean white soap clings to your fingertips and your precious monkey feet but underneath is always the odour of wild things.

Loves war against those who never attacked us, to exploit their resources? Yep ("we should have taken Iraq's oil... maybe you'll get another chance").

Loves bigoted government policy? Yep ("ban on all Muslims" again).
7319 2018-05-27 22:33:49 GOPer running for governor in florida. Big citrus and cattle man, which in florida, is like being an oil man in texas. He's got entirely too much clout.
7320 2018-05-27 22:33:42 You look like you smell like coconut oil
7321 2018-05-27 22:33:32 Kochs were literally raised by a Nazi who daddy Fred brought from Germany because he was so fond of their mindset hec witnessed while building Hitler an oil refinery.
See @JaneMayerNYer's 'Dark Money' for details.

Critics: "That's cool, but what's with the spaceships & flame throwers? Why can only rich ppl afford Teslas & solar pa-"
Musk: "BUT BIG OIL & BIG AUTO GET TAX DOLLARS TOO"
7325 2018-05-27 22:33:16 Price of crude oil is down.?
7326 2018-05-27 22:33:15 Don’t preach to the west about separation, loyalty to country or patriotism!when you do so you are as big a  hypocrite as Justin Trudeau, Québécois who denied Western oil pipe lines, BC people who deny Tidesater for Western oil! It is you who destroy this country not the west!
7327 2018-05-27 22:33:10 Best meal plan -if anyone doesn't know where to start: Big bowl of Green Salads with 1 piece of grass fed meat and some coconut oil or ghee.
7328 2018-05-27 22:32:50 The same people who screamed no blood for oil are now yelling Iranian nukes for oil?  Give me a freakin break!

7331 2018-05-27 22:32:02 honestly for me nothing worked but accutane it was a last resort. i also recommend bio oil for scarring and eating lots of fruit
7332 2018-05-27 22:31:50 I think someone had blown up and left oil on the track. And Chase got jacked up and ran into the back of the 2.
7333 2018-05-27 22:31:45 BloomyTV ticker showed $CL/#WTI crude futures off 75c, 1.12%, just now. The biggest percentage drop among the oil futures complex so far in early Monday Asia trade. Not a panic retreat on #OPEC/#Russia intent to produce. But off nonetheless. #oil #crude #futures #NYMEX #OOTT
7334 2018-05-27 22:31:44 Thanks! Just a little chapstick and coconut oil. 
7335 2018-05-27 22:31:33 Amusing. Might even be true in a very minor way. However, higher prices help the oil industry and producers. Who are friends with which #OrangeShitGibbon ?
7336 2018-05-27 22:31:09 I love breathing oil fumes and eating contaminated food. Yummy
7337 2018-05-27 22:30:46 Stir together 2 tablespoons celery with 3 pints Cantaloupe. Adorn with  Olive Oil. Roast. Serve on salad
7338 2018-05-27 22:30:43 Forbes says the Saudi crown prince is among the 10 most powerful people in the world in 2018.

His power is due to his country's continuous ability to leverage its oil wealth over the last four decades to greater influence.

Nigeria was once a contemporary of Saudia Arabia.

7343 2018-05-27 22:30:00 I used to wonder who the people were who bought the oil from the Snake-oil Salesmen and then I watched Fox "News" and figured it out....so many gullible people out there in the world. Sad
7344 2018-05-27 22:29:53 I remember when ABBA got paid in oil. Commerce is weird

7348 2018-05-27 22:28:54 Those who supported the 150 yrs of Western betrayal and alienation either directly or by denial and dismissiveness! Who ignored pleas for equal representation for fairness in interprovincial trade, who did nothing about Irving Oil or Mulroney greed for foreign oil!

7350 2018-05-27 22:28:49 Nigerian gov't should realise the need to promote indigenous entrepreneurs since there is a diversification in economy. We can’t rely on crude oil. Entrepreneurship skills development centres should be created and the older ones should be  revived.
#NotAnotherNigerian
@diansy32
7351 2018-05-27 22:28:46 Not enough refining capacity - quality of oil in storage is an issue - not easy to just 'unload'.
7352 2018-05-27 22:28:38 Funny, I interviewed Dr. Faith Fitzpatrick, chief science officer for the USGS on that spill, and she told me that a lighter crude oil would have caused a bigger disaster because currents would have spread it for 40-50 miles downstream. Also, unusual circumstances apply here.
7353 2018-05-27 22:28:37 Coffee is the second most traded commodity on Earth after oil. @Blak_Cappuccino position well oh!
7354 2018-05-27 22:28:20 oil is used to reduce friction raman during massage that's why lotion can be used as an alternative so wa siyay effect2 hahaha
7355 2018-05-27 22:28:09 One wonders what the outflow pattern is for USD-for-oil&gas, country-by-country
7356 2018-05-27 22:28:09 13 oil spills totalling 5,628 barrels of crude since 2005.  That was reported  back in 2016.
7357 2018-05-27 22:28:09 Just kick ass today, and make the haters say your name more #AD3ISREAL

7360 2018-05-27 22:27:35 I think the most simple & perfect food in the world is white beans, cooked until soft, tossed in a little olive oil, lemon juice and salt
7361 2018-05-27 22:27:25 Wheat, Silver and Oil
7362 2018-05-27 22:27:20 The Sauds are getting out of the oil game. It's just a matter of time and it'll happen sooner than later.
7363 2018-05-27 22:27:17 Thread:
Decided to try out a single serving canna oil recipe & used about 1.25 grams & after straining had about 1/4 - 1/2 cup of oil. Debated on splitting it into 2 servings but since this is a test run & I didn’t decarb my bud beforehand I said fuck it & made it 1 serving.
7364 2018-05-27 22:27:13 Yes, but there was a LOT of tequila involved
7365 2018-05-27 22:27:13 He was arranging to buy oil for your car. If the US drove cars like any normal person, then no Saudi Oil would be needed.

7368 2018-05-27 22:26:07 Thank you Sam! This has been pissing me off all week. No wonder 'new agencies' sponsored by big oil and gas take swings at @Tesla . Now we know they are concerned about Teslas success.
7369 2018-05-27 22:26:04 Itu MULAI dari 19.9k berarti ga semua barang harganya 19.9k

7371 2018-05-27 22:25:55 What did he say that was wrong? With the Iran deal done sanctions on them went back into place. That means no Iranian oil on the world market. Less supply means higher prices. Russia stepped in to fill that void. Our prices are higher. Russia is making billions. Not hard to see
7372 2018-05-27 22:25:51 Snake Oil
7373 2018-05-27 22:25:34 Play it safe bro. Fossil is a dying energy supply... cheap oil does mean cheaper plastics for manufacturing consumer good like ketchup bottle and water bottles etc ... maybe look at hedging into a co that will benefit from lower oil or short the oil co...
7374 2018-05-27 22:25:07 Such as bathing appears to you - oil, sweat, dirt, filthy water, all disgusting - so is every part of life and everything.  Marcus Aurelius

7380 2018-05-27 22:23:56 My Dr. told me to take fish oil, 2 per day.
7381 2018-05-27 22:23:54 Agreed, Mickey. In oil parlance, the rock is already fractured, just increase the pressure.
7382 2018-05-27 22:23:50 My take is energy equities weren’t priced for $70s to begin with and it’s slight positive take oil shock off table.  That combo plus looks like China ZTE $qcom in better shape & NK “less bad”
7383 2018-05-27 22:23:45 Might as well take snake oil!
7384 2018-05-27 22:23:42 True you, most of BC do not support Whoregunt! Most of Alberta! Does not support Nutbag! Problem being that sentiment does not buy food it does not make truck/house payments! Abandonment  of oil,Western Canadians, absolute betrayal by the east burning foreign oil! Heartbreaking!
7385 2018-05-27 22:23:31 Yes I recall the EU saying we aren’t welcome into the EU especially because of the economic drain an independent Scotland would put on the EU especially when Nicola wants to get rid of our only revenue- oil
7386 2018-05-27 22:23:20 Oil fell 3% overnight - hopefully keeping a lid on our petrol prices at the bowser! Iron ore was -3.7% o/nite, while metals on the LME were mixed. US markets will be closed tonight and the US jobs report will be released on Friday night.
7387 2018-05-27 22:23:01 Brings a whole new meaning to the term oil painting!
7388 2018-05-27 22:22:58 Also I went to church today and there are certain stories in the Bible I find difficult to believe for example the widow with the never ending jar of olive oil etc. God gave me a brain and I don't want to commit intellectual suicide by jumping in and believing everything.
7389 2018-05-27 22:22:28 Why did I think my albino skin could handle sitting out all day covered in tanning oil??
7390 2018-05-27 22:22:03 Today’s Horoscope for Scorpio:
Get five friends together and barbecue. It’s a great evening for foil-wrapped asparagus. Add butternut squash and cover with olive oil, garlic, sea salt, balsamic vinegar, and thyme. Grill for 10-15 minutes. Serve with lemonade or moscato.

7393 2018-05-27 22:21:31 that the sun always set on the British empire? Apparently it still does in the form of cowboys, Christianity, business and not just oil companies but tech companies and the internet is an American invention and so on. While I believe in some westerners, there's many today (2/4)

7395 2018-05-27 22:21:24 Polluting toxic fugitive Salton Sea dust from 100 years of agricultural waste water is a big problem unless you import gravity fed ocean water to cover the dust up. Polluting and expensive Oil, coal, natural gas and nuclear power plants add to soil, water and air degradation also

7399 2018-05-27 22:21:00 Or not. There's 11MM b/d of heavy crude oil refined around the world. If de-carbonized Alberta oil sands crude displaces high carbon-intensity crude from Venezuela or Nigeria, the seas win. Or you can keep supporting the bad guys and punish the good guys (Canada). Your choice.
7400 2018-05-27 22:20:58 I'm right where you are rn, been scrubbing, streaming and putting aloe to dry the acne. It's getting better ... Put a bit of oil in your lotion , to help keep the lotion on the skin

7402 2018-05-27 22:20:05 Yeah, I personally don’t use it unless I don’t have the other oils with me. Cause I use coconut oil for everything but my hair 
7403 2018-05-27 22:19:49 The problem with fish oil supplements is that most of them have oil that is rancid enough to do harm...... And it's almost impossible to pick out the samples that aren't rancid.
7404 2018-05-27 22:19:38 Okay, I got as far as the selective views of Scotland and the twiddly-dee music before I gave up. It basically backs up what I said, the UKs oil was used to the benefit of the UK’s people at the time. The nonsense propaganda suggesting Scotland didn’t benefit is >

7412 2018-05-27 22:18:12 I didn’t realize how much my hair has grown...this castor oil is no joke
7413 2018-05-27 22:18:04 Roughly 5% of the world’s daily oil consumption is attributed to shipping. One vessel can pollute more than an entire small nation of vehicles.
7414 2018-05-27 22:17:31 Okay, first, nothing in that "illiterate" info is wrong. Only one part is speculative about oil "most likely" going into the water. But Hudema didn't share that info and you don't know that's even what he based his tweet on. He could have seen the CFJC tweet for all you know.
7415 2018-05-27 22:17:26 What is called "meal -offering " or "grain offering" in KJ is actually the minchat ( Gift), contains 3 main ingredients, flour, olive oil & incense called Levonah.
7416 2018-05-27 22:17:11 I called him out multiple times so he did what any lying, snake oil salesman, jebus christ wannabe charlatan would do ... he blocked me 
7417 2018-05-27 22:17:08 Hay dud America has more oil then any country in the world wrong again!
7418 2018-05-27 22:16:57 The suppression and secrecy surrounding the McCrone report should incense every reasonable thinking person. Dragging us into the Iraq war, millions dead, millions left with nothing but despair. All over oil. Now give me justification for staying in this union.

7454 2018-05-27 22:10:17 They ran the industry differently. They had a much smaller population. It brought them out of years of austerity and they retained a state oil company. None of this is to suggest the UK was wrong, it just made different choices, from which we benefitted at the time.

7465 2018-05-27 22:09:41 Because you think "they could have been," you're willing to make accusations? Sad way to see the world. I wouldn't call you a liar or make conspiratorial statements because you support the oil industry. Just debate the facts.

7493 2018-05-27 22:07:08 It’s not. Oil and gas companies have interests in RE and don’t fight it because it’s not a threat to them.

They fight nuclear power because it *is* a threat to them.
7494 2018-05-27 22:06:41 Oil & Natural Gas = 48% of Russian exports = $173 Billion/ Yr. Their biggest competitor? The United States.

7501 2018-05-27 22:05:29 @elonmusk @Tesla imagine if the same money being pumped into the oil lobby was moved towards development of electric cars and subsidizing the cost of it for mass production. The oil rich country’s influence which make us slaves to ever changing foreign policy would be diminished.

7509 2018-05-27 22:04:33 I understand what you mean by it but here's why I don't agree it's appropriate here. Values can't be falsified. If I value the production of oil over human life you can disagree with those kinds of values but the values are still real.

7514 2018-05-27 22:04:11 Oh noo lol you can use a soft tissue with some oil...it works well esp like coconut oil and it takes it off so easily lol
7515 2018-05-27 22:04:10 Why not, they pay for everything else. We American Indians contribute a fair amount too. What for, I can't imagine. My dad refused to accept oil money from the Cherokee Reservation because he said, "I didn't earn it so I don't want it."
7516 2018-05-27 22:04:09 America is driving on its rims without oil in the engine.  I think it's probably more respectful to the car to recognize it needs repair.  The US is broken with racism.  Wake up or be racist and continue to drive this nation and its middle class into the ground.
7517 2018-05-27 22:04:00 You’d probably max out if you did

7538 2018-05-27 22:00:06 Everyone I've ever met who screams about how it's so sacrilege to put pineapple on pizza has never tried it.

You don't throw pineapple on a deep dish tomato sauce pepperoni pizza. You make a pizza with ham, or bacon, and an olive oil or cheese sauce. And then goes the pineapple.

7540 2018-05-27 21:59:56 I use CBD oil. It works as an nsaid which is more long term, like ibuprofen, and keeps the inflammation down. I've not tried thc but I am warming up to the idea of taking it for accute pain instead of oxy.

7559 2018-05-27 21:58:06 Wouldn't gas logically cost more due to it being a rural area in a historically Democratic state? Also, what Iran does won't really effect our oil imports, since Saudi Arabia is the one who supplies us with a lot of our oil imports (plus we're allies with them).
7560 2018-05-27 21:58:04 I feel the same way but I bought some goddamn Goe oil from them & now I can’t unsubscribe from their emails because I pretend someday I might be rich & fancy enough to actually buy something else
7561 2018-05-27 21:58:00 I feel bad for the olive oil and fefe shippers because they can't admit that their ship was wrong to do what they did at the wedding. Well the possibl karma is that their ship is getting a future daughter or kids soon

7570 2018-05-27 21:57:25 I stand by my statement. Never seen anyone fucked up onboard.  Maybe that’s from moving oil and that it’s too good of a job to risk losing. I’ll say again, if that’s what you’re dealing with you should find a new job.

7641 2018-05-27 21:50:59 I think you’ll find that Republican lawmakers support renewables. But you’ll also find that they support coal mining and oil drilling — it’s evident in the polling provided by Pew.

7676 2018-05-27 21:46:19 Just think if Scotland dedicated the oil revenues on infrastructure projects like this that would last much longer and employ thousands...
7677 2018-05-27 21:46:14 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
7678 2018-05-27 21:46:13 I'd prefer someone gave him an enema with used motor oil.
7679 2018-05-27 21:46:12 JUST IN: B.C. environment ministry has confirmed a 100L oil spill at @Kinder_Morgan's Trans Mountain Darfield station north of Kamloops. Leak occurred from a flow metre. Story to come. @BlackPressMedia
7680 2018-05-27 21:46:11 I thought my landlord was going to be out all weekend but instead he got home just in time to see me setting off all the fire alarms in the house by cooking sweet potato with low-quality cooking oil!
7681 2018-05-27 21:45:58 Australian shares are expected to open lower this morning, continuing last week's losses. This is primarily due to the price of oil retreating, US-listed BHP fell 3.7 per cent for instance. #oil #market #tech #morning #finance #australia #money
7682 2018-05-27 21:45:57 2017 Non oil revenue: The Federal Inland Revenue Service, FIRS, said it generated N4 trillion from tax revenue collected in 2017.
7683 2018-05-27 21:45:55 Na me fuck up loool. 
But essential oil differs from fragrance oil sha. Fragrance oil is cheaper.
7684 2018-05-27 21:45:48 I fall in love every time I smell onions frying in oil
7685 2018-05-27 21:45:47 Yeah that's right bt it's not a diesel or patrols prices it's a crude oil price , yeah that's right that govt gets lots of taxes and that time when crude oil prices reached lvl $80 per barrel they have to cut their taxes ,
7686 2018-05-27 21:45:33 ...says the guy with a GoFundMe account embedded in his profile.
7687 2018-05-27 21:45:30 Oil Can
7688 2018-05-27 21:45:27 I played the old map right before & got 5th. I got lucky, I was on top of this oil rig thing & the circle closed right around me. Had 2 kills before I went up there, dropped down on the last guy to win.
7689 2018-05-27 21:45:26 If you wish to remain ignorant, that is your choice.
7690 2018-05-27 21:45:20 I don’t believe taxes have risen on gasoline for a while. Certainly the GST hasn’t. 

But if you’re talking about the price going up from 1.00 to 1.50 it’s the barrel price up from 26 to 72. 

And also refining issues. Check Suncor stock chart - refiner . Now CPG - Oil producer.

7694 2018-05-27 21:44:56 2016 non oil revenue: The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) realized N3.30 trillion tax revenue for the nation’s coffers.
7695 2018-05-27 21:44:54 Ordered my oil pressure sensor so lets hope it arrives this week
7696 2018-05-27 21:44:43 Labelling economics as neoliberal doesn't invalidate it. Econ theory & empirics largely said neoliberalism itself (and certainly austerity) was snake oil. Financial capitalism sucks, but don't throw the baby out with the bathwater: wishful thinking is no substitute for analysis
7697 2018-05-27 21:44:39 Oil and has industry (especially the oil sands) is far more regulated than the forestry industry, based on my observations. Maybe we should create a sign that says “Stop Pumping Sewage Into the St Lawrence!”
7698 2018-05-27 21:44:17 Millionaire pretend socialists, getting into power on that lie, then sending the working classes to war in the oil revenue interests of right wing capitalist American profiteers whilst killing millions including 1000s of civilians & launching murderous jihad, get on my tits tbh
7699 2018-05-27 21:44:14 No, but they’ll use oil from countries with poor enviro policies and few human rights, continue to poor crap into the St. Lawrence and accept the greater % of equalization payments, thank-you very much. Hypocrites on parade.
7700 2018-05-27 21:44:03 ふごキャラ描きたい欲あるけど構図も何も浮かばない
7701 2018-05-27 21:44:01 @OrvillePopcorn your popcorn contains Palm Oil which contributes to Rain Forrest destruction, I did find another brand that did not contain it, anyway to remove it?
7702 2018-05-27 21:44:00 Nice job...you'll be exhibiting in a museum soon!!
I love wildlife art...could be drawing or various types of paintings.

Seen some oil paintings I like...then I saw the prices 
7703 2018-05-27 21:43:57 You never know where even the simplest idea can take you. Michele Ferrero, for instance, added vegetable oil to a traditional chocolate hazelnut paste and invented Nutella, according to Wikipedia. = BILLIONAIRE
7704 2018-05-27 21:43:51 Yes!It had nothing to do with the FACT that Qadafi was interested in trading oil for gold & not accepting American fiat anymore!It had to do with the fact that he ruled his people with so iron of a fist, that there wasn't even human slavery! So deserving of a bayonet up his ass!
7705 2018-05-27 21:43:06 China's Footprint is growing in Mexico w the Cuban oil exploration!
7706 2018-05-27 21:42:57 Ladies oil wrestling, I mean.
7707 2018-05-27 21:42:48 Oil is like a fine wine
7708 2018-05-27 21:42:47 Compared to the conventional oil that in fact sinks. Dilbit has been known to float over a week. Tested in a university lab wave tank. And should there be a spill, is easier to clean up. But tell me oh, enlighten one. In the Athabaska river where the naturally bitumen seeps into
7709 2018-05-27 21:42:42 @davidhogg111 *their  No wonder you couldn’t get into a good college.
7710 2018-05-27 21:42:42 Correct

All electronic devices produce toxic chemicals during manufacturing 

So does Oil

How do we measure what's worse?

Certainly free electricity is a plus with solar
7711 2018-05-27 21:42:31 In 2014 when there was a run on the rouble, caused by sanctions and a plummeting oil price, the Russian Central Bank secured it using foreign currency reserves. It’s an exchange rate thing, in part
7712 2018-05-27 21:42:20 That is why you never pay for hostages.
7713 2018-05-27 21:42:18 He's an amateur-league Mob protection racket.
7714 2018-05-27 21:42:15 Un(?)popular opinion: you aren't vegan if you eat things made with palm oil
7715 2018-05-27 21:42:12 With palm oil by your side to drink after sex.
7716 2018-05-27 21:42:03 That’s BS, gas prices are always rising at the beginning of spring into summer. What we need is another refinery, actually a couple of them. You get a couple more refineries and gas prices will plummet. US should stop exporting our oil. Oil cost in US should be stable, it’s greed
7717 2018-05-27 21:42:03 Hi John, what do you think of $zap @ZapOracles ? Probably the next docademic as it has real purpose and their SDK is going to be released in a few days. They solved the oracle problem for smart contracts & dapps. Oil Giant Aramco is also looking for the adoption of their tech...
7718 2018-05-27 21:41:41 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
7719 2018-05-27 21:41:41 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
7720 2018-05-27 21:41:30 Correct on the price of oil Brian, but not on the price of gas. Taxes have a lot to do with it.
7721 2018-05-27 21:41:25 What is it you do that you fail? The key is to use oil and water together at the base (I often add a tiny pinch of saffron to the base as well) and to dump all the meat sauce on top or on in the top layers alone. Otherwise sauce will ooze to the base and will get burnt.
7722 2018-05-27 21:41:22 There has been a TransMountain oil spill near Darfield BC, details to come.
7723 2018-05-27 21:40:48 Oil don't care.
7724 2018-05-27 21:40:45 Mates car pissing oil. Waiting to be towed back. Been waiting for almost 2 hours now
7725 2018-05-27 21:40:35 Do stupid statements like this enhance Sena's credibility ? Anyone who follows crude oil prices and understands govt's determination not to subsidize,fully understands why fuel prices have risen !
7726 2018-05-27 21:40:29 あ！何かガスマスクつけた白い鳥がいるぞ！待てー！
7727 2018-05-27 21:40:14 ああ、これ？スポーツブラ。油の貯蔵庫が垂れちゃうからね。
7728 2018-05-27 21:40:10 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
7729 2018-05-27 21:40:07 I have such a sudden craving for pasta with some olive oil and a bit of parmesan...

7731 2018-05-27 21:39:47 Hey! Wyden!, I grew up in the “Oil Patch” let me tell you where the money goes, (1) Federal, State, & Local Taxes, (2) Transportation Regulations, (3) Middle Men, (4) Refinery Processes, etc., of which your party put on the industry all the way to the pump. Your Un-informed.
7732 2018-05-27 21:39:45 I go hunting in Carbon County, near Hazelton. Where do you hunt in PA?
7733 2018-05-27 21:39:45 Ok but what would happen if I put rosé in my oil diffuser
7734 2018-05-27 21:39:33 on each occasion The Donald abolishes a crucial regulation, more than one earthling dies a slow emotional death
7735 2018-05-27 21:39:25 1. Mix 2 tbsp of original dawn soap and 1 tbsp of vegetable oil in a 1 L spray bottle with warm water.
2. Spray liberally directly on caterpillars, this mixture prevents oxygen intake through the skin.
7736 2018-05-27 21:39:13 Dad was a firefighter and then Fire Chief, drilled that into my siblings and I as kids. I did the same with mine.  Always look for the exits, and the path to them. Fire is more likely than a shooting anyway......

7741 2018-05-27 21:38:31 Nothing is guaranteed these days, just have to deal with stuff if and when they come up, ndp still want and need our oil so....
7742 2018-05-27 21:38:26 Nooooo it's nothing!!! I am so bad at verbalizing but.... the painting feel i get from this?? like i am seeing an oil painting with the way you do light? ok I am so bad at this just know I love it so much 
7743 2018-05-27 21:38:19 We set prices for booze, milk,  surely we can get oil from NL and Alberta to be good for Canada.
7744 2018-05-27 21:38:14 Nas primeiras vezes que eu ouvi Beds are Burning, do Midnight Oil, foi num bar daqui de Jundiaí com jukebox. Eu achava que era uma música sobre fim de relacionamento, "how do we sleep while the beds are burning?".
7745 2018-05-27 21:37:47 No oil
7746 2018-05-27 21:37:44 If you believe that dribble in the Financial Times, then your in for a good night sleep. The premise is that the increase in  oil prices was all hype. If so, why would OPEC + even consider relaxing compliance with cuts? Just tell everyone to “relax” ...
7747 2018-05-27 21:37:24 correlation =/= causation. And boiling in oil is not frying, just boiling. Or so the Scottish side of my ancestry insisted.
7748 2018-05-27 21:37:21 Somehow I just don’t think he is the authority on this subject.
7749 2018-05-27 21:37:14 Hey SCHMUCK. Oil prices have just dropped dramatically. Was close to 72 now 67. Iran has virtually nothing to do with the recent run up in prices. MORON.
7750 2018-05-27 21:37:05 We can't fix central America but we can fix the middle east where the oil is right?
7751 2018-05-27 21:36:43 Is it just me or is this country looking more and more like an episode of VEEP?
7752 2018-05-27 21:36:28 I hope, there's no train lacking oil pressure right now !
7753 2018-05-27 21:36:21 Face oil. Stalk aja akunnya
7754 2018-05-27 21:36:15 Oya let’s try perfume oil.
7755 2018-05-27 21:36:14 Dawn dishwashing liquid - rubbed on straight like lotion. You’ll bubble a lot, but it cuts the noxious oil that causes the poison ivy rash. Then wash your clothes in Dawn.
7756 2018-05-27 21:36:12 Very dishonest and ignorant analysis by @RonWyden . Oil markets have been trending higher among many variables, the more relevant being global gdp growth. #Iran is a factor, but it only represents 5% of global supply. So this is a cheap attack on @realDonaldTrump by @RonWyden

7760 2018-05-27 21:35:44 So did Obama profit of the high oil prices as well there and did he manipulate it as well.
7761 2018-05-27 21:35:41 Steamies: people who like water
Diesels: people who like soda
Oil burners: people who like both
7762 2018-05-27 21:35:13 Face oil. Gunanya beda2 sesuai variannya. Bisa jadi pengganti serum gt
7763 2018-05-27 21:35:12 Maybe you want to go have a chat with those people you shove onto reservations...at least until you realise they have oil or you know run a shitty oil pipe line through the water supply.

I dont think i'm the one who needs the research.

7770 2018-05-27 21:34:03 @realDonaldTrump - Gas prices SHOOTING UP because of your Iran policy and your Saudi pals who like high oil prices - maybe they'll roll out the red carpet again for you! #MAGA @FoxNews
7771 2018-05-27 21:33:57 Oh that thank you for being condescending. I am very aware if oil futures.
7772 2018-05-27 21:33:49 @AndrewScheer as leader of the Conservatives, what are you doing to *conserve* our nations enviroment, and future proof our economy by investing in a competitive education on all levels for all and research and development initiatives in the tech sector? Not all investment is oil
7773 2018-05-27 21:33:45 Balsamic, olive oil, & fresh basil on top of sliced bell peppers & onions, then grilled. Very few better things
7774 2018-05-27 21:33:10 Covered in that sweet smell of tanning oil, it must be summer

7783 2018-05-27 21:31:48 Based on what?  Agriculture? Oil? Textiles?  Bitcoin?  Peace, yes. But stop pretending you’re unleashing some type of trade compromise.
7784 2018-05-27 21:31:45 Nooooo. You don’t want to do that! It’s terrible!
7785 2018-05-27 21:31:31 It was so fun to learn about how they make olive oil and I found it super interesting how the oil isn’t so bad for you after all!! #2018ldv
7786 2018-05-27 21:31:29 I did this once except it was their tea tree oil in my hair instead of sea salt spray

7788 2018-05-27 21:31:24 That's not accurate. Jubail and Yanbu belongs to Royal Commission and has nothing to do with Oil commodity at all. Jubail and Yanbu built to serve Petrochemical industry that was not existing at that time.Similarly NEOM is a new industry area which should succeed if planned well.
7789 2018-05-27 21:31:19 So who is going2put the pressure on the French Gov+never purchase palm oil? I can only do 1 of the two. Sadly.

7799 2018-05-27 21:30:08 have had me ma get this massive spoon, filled to the brim with cod liver oil... dunno which was worse, that or taking milk of magnesia..
7800 2018-05-27 21:30:04 Today, there is massive flooding in Ellicott City, near Baltimore. The GOP and Big Oil own this because they have promoted #ClimateChange denial as the planet gets hotter. I live in the Midwest, and it's 97 in May after being 100 yesterday.
7801 2018-05-27 21:29:58 The cocunit oil is half solid half liquid. It's also away from the window. The thought of putting it on reminds me shrimp in garlic butter. Nope. Also I am hungry.

7807 2018-05-27 21:29:27 Question, Is it better to cook cod fillets in butter or olive oil?
7808 2018-05-27 21:29:22 For the oil thing?!?
7809 2018-05-27 21:29:19 • Kick-started America’s energy sector by curtailing regulations, facilitating the Keystone XL Pipeline and opening up vast federal areas to oil and gas exploration.

7811 2018-05-27 21:28:58 Yer maws an oil & gas engineer
7812 2018-05-27 21:28:50 Nope. It's taxpayers bailing out a Texas oil company. Also bailing you out since you have you have a financial interest in this matter.  You can pretend government bailing you out - an oil sands investment banker - is in the national interest, but that doesn't make it so.
7813 2018-05-27 21:28:49 I would suggest ...
1- buy a bag of baked potato chips (Lays eg) in metalized plastic, and not fried in oil.
2- put phone in.
3- verify its blocked by calling phone.
This seems to work as far as I can tell.
7814 2018-05-27 21:28:42 I hope everyone has a safe holiday weekend!! Stay hydrated. Use sunscreen! If you get too much sun grab some Burt’s Bees aloe & coconut oil after sun soother! I got a bit “too much” sun yesterday and this has helped a lot! 

And don’t drink & drive!

7819 2018-05-27 21:26:56 Oil is the answer
7820 2018-05-27 21:26:50 The pic is showing where the oil will end up!
7821 2018-05-27 21:26:44 I fy l, m oil ruy
7822 2018-05-27 21:26:30 I like to roast them with plenty of oil (I much prefer rapeseed to olive for cooking), salt and thyme. Toast some hazelnuts and mix the whole lot through a lot of leaves (spinach, chard and rocket is a good combo imo) with a drizzle of balsamic.
7823 2018-05-27 21:26:24 What I mean by the previous tweet is to say that according to the Alberta government's first quater fiscal report, oil revenue is $648M under budget. That's a serious flaw in our economic system.  Also, we need a clearer breakdown of our GDP by the #NDP #ABgov. #KinderMorgan
7824 2018-05-27 21:26:18 Following the teaching of @DaddyFRZ is like following Judas Iscariot who said the oil should have been sold to take care of poor people. Thank God that Jesus gave it to him. I hope you know how he ended.
7825 2018-05-27 21:25:37 Snake oil. I know one firm of financial advisers who had their own fund 100% invested in this. Stick to low cost trackers
7826 2018-05-27 21:25:20 fishy chicken, you could be on to something "How to give cod liver oil to children and make 'em drink it?" like what we used to back when we were wee lil 'uns. tasted like *gack, gack* cod liver oil disguised in chicken..
7827 2018-05-27 21:25:17 Needed some urgent good decision by this govt regarding oil price hike otherwise all hope of general will be destroyed because middle class is getting nailed everywhere and congress workers taking benefits #we don’t have exact answer
7828 2018-05-27 21:24:56 I don't understand why people need to go to school to be a massage therapist. All you're doing is rubbing coconut oil on a strangers back. How hard can it be?
7829 2018-05-27 21:24:52 Baby oil everywhere
7830 2018-05-27 21:24:46 @chedetofficial Diminta agar Tun mempertimbangkan GLC seperti Sime Darby mengaktifkan semula industri tenaganya di dalam sektor Oil & Gas. Ini adalah bertujuan untuk merancakkan dan mewujudkan persaingan sihat antara syarikat Malaysia dan menghadkan campur tangan syarikat asing.
7831 2018-05-27 21:24:28 Niggas ride around in old benzes and beamers just to say they have one. Instead of getting something practical and driveable that they can actually afford the oil change on.
7832 2018-05-27 21:24:28 Who’s in Modesto and wants to change my oil for me?? I’ll pay ya ((:
7833 2018-05-27 21:24:23 So it turns out that you are supposed to change the oil in your car every 3-4 months, NOT 3-4 months after the oil light turns on
7834 2018-05-27 21:24:11 That flax oil burp just ruined everything.
7835 2018-05-27 21:23:55 Canada doesn’t set oil prices. You’re welcome to read up on it. Lots of articles on how the price of a barrel fluctuates and why.
7836 2018-05-27 21:23:46 Olbas oil. :))
7837 2018-05-27 21:23:44 Lmao i fry mine without oil
7838 2018-05-27 21:23:36 Ooh, I miss painting. I have no space with light, so I got oil pastels.
7839 2018-05-27 21:23:36 Bottom line is Hillary was in the pocket of Big oil and Wall St. So while she would have taken the country down the toilet at 100 MPH like Trump she would have taken it down the toilet at 55 MPH and many more people wouldn't have noticed. Both are horrible results.
7840 2018-05-27 21:23:26 Have you tried CBD oil ? My dogs are old and have many health ailments CBD has helped them to live much more comfortable

7843 2018-05-27 21:22:51 Put some tanning oil on and soaked in that sun  I refuse to go out looking like Casper the friendly ghost  this summer.
7844 2018-05-27 21:22:31 @JuliaRobertsTV I love elemis.  The oil is GREAT for my oily skin. My skin does not feel so oily. It has really helped. Thanks elemis. xx
7845 2018-05-27 21:22:24 Manybtimes eye operation and partial removalnof oil each eye takes time 2 do it like 6mos apart.  Vision not perfect anymore but getting better.  Sometimes not good if you are tired and lack of sleep.  You should not carry heavy things.  Medication eye drops.
7846 2018-05-27 21:22:09 Honestly thought of a 'strictly-boiled food' household after the oil entered my eye 
7847 2018-05-27 21:22:04 In a little sea salt and place into a splash of extra virgin olive oil until cooked through.
7848 2018-05-27 21:21:54 I stopped by a Trump gas pump in Eastern Oregon where gas prices are skyrocketing. @realDonaldTrump’s reckless decision to break our deal with Iran has only added to the spike in pump prices and created massive uncertainty in oil markets. #RonReport

7854 2018-05-27 21:21:10 If the kids do not have parents then how are they coming up with the thousands of dollars it takes to pay the coyotes? Given the high cost, it’s likely that every last one of them has parents. Otherwise, they couldn’t afford the migration.
7855 2018-05-27 21:21:05 Enjoy a good extra virgen olive oil and make them machines
7856 2018-05-27 21:20:59 Fake news story.  Stop defending Trump at every turn.  He is a swindler and you fell for the snake oil pitch.
7857 2018-05-27 21:20:59 Used a new beard oil and my face is so fucking soft right now.
7858 2018-05-27 21:20:44 Me too, I do it more often than you really need to (I clean and oil after every shoot) but it’s kind of a ritual for me, I want it perfect every time haha
7859 2018-05-27 21:20:30 I always say how I never get burnt but I’m 100% sure I did this time & I actually put sun screen instead of tanning oil 
7860 2018-05-27 21:20:29 Like Oil (Reprise) -We Will Worship
7861 2018-05-27 21:19:56 could it be due to the property he bought and put in his wife's name where the oil pipeline goes right through and receives a royalty ?as was reported a year ago
7862 2018-05-27 21:19:55 That's right and that's part of the reason I boycotted them years ago.  Also, iirc, babies got sick because the water to make up the formula was unclean? Another reason is because they use Palm Oil in their chocolate and I boycott all products with Palm Oil.
7863 2018-05-27 21:19:53 Waiting for the new oil royalty promised by gov.

7869 2018-05-27 21:19:02 4/6

... science advances like other countries did with an exception of having oil to sell and more money to buy new technologies faster.

7870 2018-05-27 21:18:45 Chesapeake energy- earnings this month. This stock took hits since 2014 from 30 to 2.95 today. Weak oil prices and large amounts of debt.  It’s first Wednesday of the month so gasoline production, crude oil inventories, gasoline inventory. All OPEC reports. 2.90 to 4.55
7871 2018-05-27 21:18:43 No he’s a fcn moron. First Oregon is about as far Left as you can get. What’s their Party message ‘Raise taxes’. Their doing it with gas. Next we don’t by oil from Iran  the Far East does. You want to cleanse this country from idiocy like Wyden, flip every Dem to Rep in CA/NY
7872 2018-05-27 21:18:39 Yes. Butter rocks. Bloody rapeseed oil is in everything though. Ah well. Night both xx
7873 2018-05-27 21:18:36 Sure, but they accept that there are oil tankers in the Gulf of St. Lawrence? Bringing in foreign oil.
7874 2018-05-27 21:18:35 Yeah I like oil cleansers for removing makeup but sometimes they make my skin feel tight afterwards so doing the other steps after usually gets rid of that feeling for me

7877 2018-05-27 21:18:00 I also quite like making burgers with potato patties. Instructions: 1. Grate potato. 2. Heat oil in frying pan. 3. Put dollop of grated potato in pan and form into patty. 4. Fry until crisp. 5. Put in burger.
7878 2018-05-27 21:17:55 So, you live in a country where the oil and automobile industries have shaped every aspect of transportation. You feel good when you can buy a car that lets you commute through the mess they created. You're right where they want you to be.

7882 2018-05-27 21:16:49 Vet offered a recommendation to a clinic but it is hundreds of miles away and he doesn't do well at all with travel. I'm trying cannabis oil but I think the cancer is already too advanced
7883 2018-05-27 21:16:47 I think petrol is healthier than water and oil
7884 2018-05-27 21:16:16 Oh okay, I've been using the Clinique Take The Day Off Oil
7885 2018-05-27 21:16:11 cant stop thinking about hemp cookie and they’re pet, hemp oil
7886 2018-05-27 21:16:01 Because the oil revenues that made it possible are no longer there, AS WAS SAID IN THE VERY ARTICLE YOU POSTED. And even with that we still had to run a huge deficit to run the country. Oh wait. Thats right. Scotland doesn’t have a deficit or any debt....just Westminster..
7887 2018-05-27 21:16:00 Um no. Because I was never caught in secret meetings that I lied about over and over. Plus refusal enforce sanctions... plus kissing Putin’s ass!
And the fact that you brought our conversation to be personal which I never did, you can’t go F off!
7888 2018-05-27 21:15:47 I use Wrights cake mixes ,they are very good, only need water & a little veg oil .but all supermarkets have lots of different ones
7889 2018-05-27 21:15:46 Whip together 9 tsps bluefish with 2 quarts Graham crackers. Add Olive Oil. Freeze for 9 hours. Serve over kale.
7890 2018-05-27 21:15:39 60% of US oil consumption is imported. So once again StateTV is lying to you.
7891 2018-05-27 21:15:37 @JuliaRobertsTV how much of the oil should I use?
7892 2018-05-27 21:15:31 ohhhh sounds nice tbh?? so kinda like donuts except dry milk instead of flour and syrup instead of sugar/ oil? like texture wise
7893 2018-05-27 21:15:26 He put more sanctions on Russia because of the election meddling. Where as 45 overlooks russia sanctions and rewards then with oil sales. All the while threatening to nuke anybody that doesn't kiss his ass.
7894 2018-05-27 21:15:23 I use Neutrogena ultra light cleansing oil if I have a lot of make up on, or I use Simple's micellar cleansing water either way i always do the 7 steps afterwards!

7903 2018-05-27 21:13:58 According to the EIA, the Iran deal adds at most 5 cents a gallon. The booming economy, with more oil being consumed,  plus the beginning of the summer driving season is the real reason, they expect the price to drop within the next 60 days, as production ramps up.
7904 2018-05-27 21:13:41 I don’t have a bike capable of carrying 400 litres of oil. But the landfill takes used oil and filters and antifreeze 7 days a week.
7905 2018-05-27 21:13:33 Pros & cons of oil vaping over dry leaf vaping ? Love the oils ..
7906 2018-05-27 21:13:22 Personally think the Canadian real estate is in bubble territory, shorts have been making some killing...leveraging is quite high, all recipe for problem (good thing oil price is recovering)
7907 2018-05-27 21:13:21 The poor dang coal miners were so sold on his line of horseshit and snake oil that MANY refused retraining into tech jobs. I read that and cried for the poor dumb SOB’s Treachery, that is treachery.
7908 2018-05-27 21:13:20 To a reasonable extent. The price of fertilizer is now around 5k from 12k through revival of 12 moribund fertilizer plants. By the time petrolex, Dangote, Shell, and full conssession of the 4 Nigerian refineries is completed. The oil sector will boom.

7917 2018-05-27 21:11:47 Just use wild growth oil it helped me out a lot like honestly. I’ll text you the pics.
7918 2018-05-27 21:11:30 For the first time since like 2014 i had a fun unselfconscious time spending the day making some giant ass oil paintings and i hope this means i am one step closer to exorcising Inner Voices of Internalized Doubts that stop me from being in the present moment
7919 2018-05-27 21:11:18 Now that I’ve went plant based, it’s time to cut out the soda (which I made sure the brand I was drinking is vegan) and oil. I’ve been feeling so good lately and by consuming these things, I feel gross. I can feel the oil in my body. 
7920 2018-05-27 21:10:43 FACTS

Crude oil Prices
Congress - 2010-14 - 1.18 $/litre
BJP -          2015-2018 - 1.17 $/Litre

2010-14 - 1$= Rs 51
2015-18 -  1$ = Rs 65.5

7928 2018-05-27 21:10:11 Wait. So Buhari actually came on air to calculate Nigeria's Crude oil revenue for PDP's 16yrs based on $100 per barrel at 2.2m barrels per day? And none of his Aides could walk up close to him and whisper, "Oga, your head is not correct" ~ ?

7932 2018-05-27 21:09:52 Natalia, back in the 70s Venezuela was the one and only country that provided the US with fuel and oil when the OPEC made a boycott on the oil supply to your country. Until the arrival of Chavez into power, we were your allies in the continent
7933 2018-05-27 21:09:50 Paradox-Nigeria had better economic policies through 2000s ( compared to 60s, 70s when u think our parents better off). But transmission mechanism- capable state- to transform growth from better policies & higher oil prices into structural economic capacities broken.
7934 2018-05-27 21:09:14 Let me know when you figure out what oil futures are.
7935 2018-05-27 21:09:11 Oh dear, I meant fragrance oil, the type used in soap making.
7936 2018-05-27 21:09:09 So I'm working on human flesh tones in oil paint and it's been so long since I've had to fight with a painting. It's very hard not to fall into the bad habit of quitting and working on something easier to me. #studiotime #practicemakesperfect

7939 2018-05-27 21:08:59 Seen some odd things in Starbucks but this is top five. Hipster painting a canvas with oil paints of trees copied from computer. Dude we are in@Canada go outside, lots of trees there!!!
7940 2018-05-27 21:08:40 Gausah pake eye krim, essence sama serum dulu. Makenya bertahap, 17 tahun mah pake basic aja double cleansing, toner, moist sama sunscreen. Skip cleansing oil jadi micellar oil nya garnier. Yg penting exfoliate sama maskernya. Buat ngebersihin mukamu aja dulu
7941 2018-05-27 21:08:37 If it goes down, oil prices will depreciate again.
7942 2018-05-27 21:08:24 Right, who’s a better human being... A sex worker or a Harvard educated attorney that defends oil companys that destroy the environment for hundreds of years.

7946 2018-05-27 21:07:57 Absolutely false. Petrol CONgress time ke comparison mein 2-3 ₹ jyaada costly hai. FYI oil outstanding has been paid. Pulses, food etc are cheap. Inflation is in control. Thoda fact check kar lo bhai. Waise 2019 mein to Modi hi aayega.
7947 2018-05-27 21:07:57 The US burns 20,000,000 barrels of oil/day. That converts to 34 TWh/day. That's just oil, not natgas or nukes.  

In 2014, world energy output was 155,481 TWh. #Bitcoin is just under 70 TWh. Bitcoin uses ~0.0005% of that. I bet militaries combined use more than that.

7953 2018-05-27 21:06:15 It really helps keep your skin smooth and it has a lot of benefits I like to use the oil on my face at night and it makes my skin feel so much better. There are other oils and lotions for dryness though if you’re looking for some.
7954 2018-05-27 21:06:15 Journalists, most probably paid by oil companies, are trying really hard... how can we wind Elon musk up? We need to slow down /stop this electric revolution mess. I’m Seriously fed up with all the negative press around EVs. Journalists, people don’t believe you anymore.
7955 2018-05-27 21:06:05 What percent of oil comes from Iran? About 3% but Iran uses those profits to fund terrorism.  Blocking revenue for a terrorist regime makes since to most unbiased Americans.

7958 2018-05-27 21:05:42 “Pentagon chiefs have long accused Beijing of rapidly building-up its military power in the South China Sea as part of ambitions to control the oil and gas rich seas, through which huge amounts of shipping sails through on its way to North and South American seaports.”

7962 2018-05-27 21:05:03 I've also melted down just regular coconut oil and used that and its helped
7963 2018-05-27 21:04:53 A lot of people seem to be buying Jordan Peterson's snake oil on this—he redefines "truth" so he can peddle myths and sell repackaged traditional Christian values. A TV evangelist for the YouTube age.

And have you heard what he has to say about lobster hiearchy?
7964 2018-05-27 21:04:48 You hypocrite. Taking oil money from a basically slave state you really are a card. Stay away from Britain. You’re really not welcome.
7965 2018-05-27 21:04:38 I love a bit of vinyl. I just don't like bellends going on about it. Or beard oil.
7966 2018-05-27 21:04:23 Put ½ cup of rice and 2 Tbsp. Cooking oil into a large, deep pot. Cover tightly and cook over medium-high heat until the rice begins to pop, 3 to 4 minutes. Give pot a firm up-and-down shake every 30 seconds or so.
7967 2018-05-27 21:04:22 Let's thank the Lord for coconut oil cause I massaged my friends' heads with it for like 2 hours... Just Indian things...
7968 2018-05-27 21:04:15 Looks like I should have invested in oil... gas prices are getting high as sh!t.
7969 2018-05-27 21:03:57 Unfortunately I agree, a country notorious for doping, extreme racism and homophobia and questionable foreign policy should never have been allowed to host. Obviously russian oil money means more

7976 2018-05-27 21:02:10 For stability in gas prices the government gives subsidies to oil companies to reduce the financial risks associated with exploration and this gives us stability so companies and people know what they'll spend..@SenStabenow knows this but tries to rile people up to score points.

7979 2018-05-27 21:00:54 It was quite speculative about this but then k searched about it.
Actually before 2014 congress used to provide subsidy on oil which got burden because it reached nearly 10 billion dollars in 2014 which later abolished because fuel prices were slashing at high rate.

7985 2018-05-27 21:00:08 Gas prices only fluctuate from how much oil there is. Nothing can really be done except to attain more of it to lower prices, which needs to be done over a long time so as to not cause unintended harm to gas stations and companies.
7986 2018-05-27 21:00:07 Content: food

So as I'm dieting properly again, I cooked myself turkey and butternut squash jalfrezi. Oh, by all the food related gods it was soooooo good. Also, was what I actually call medium hot. Instead of ghee, I used olive oil. Perfectly good substitution.

7989 2018-05-27 20:59:58 @shanedawson this isn’t a conspiracy theory but talk about the oil embargo in 1970’s. Perhaps it’s happening with prescription drugs rn. There’s shortages everywhere... CONSPIRACY.
7990 2018-05-27 20:59:45 yeah but they gave up and walked off and I got covered in oil so I guess I lost really
7991 2018-05-27 20:59:38 You're an Econ-challenged hack!Oil prices have been climbing due to increased demand from strengthened world/US economy!Trump policies enabling more oil/gas drilling have moderated that-something Dems wouldn't do.If Hillary were POTUS you would looking at gas lines,not gas signs!

8011 2018-05-27 20:56:32 It’s a weird thing! I’ve been grappling with this as I started painting in the last couple years, and making images in oil on canvas that are just specific specimens of a whole thought process: am I more interested in the snapshot, or the engine that creates the framework for it?
8012 2018-05-27 20:56:31 Olive oil, avocado oil, butter (lots), milk... and cheese. Oh and meat and fish have fat too. Is that the good stuff?

8015 2018-05-27 20:55:18 We've had a pretty traumatic event occur in our family this week but I've had a little time to turn my brain off by working on this oil painting.  Painting had proven to be such a stress and worry reliever for me.  It's still a work in progress but I'm enjoying the process.

But their allegation misses the mark. Instead, a macro-level adjustment of global oil supply and demand boosted prices from their lowest point in decades-and it's tough to blame Trump.'

8075 2018-05-27 20:45:24 I can’t remember when, but the price of oil became a world-wide commodity. That changed everything. We were fracking like made and driving the price of oil/gas down. OPEC then flooded the market with oil, thus oil was too cheap and fracking wasn’t worth the cost. 1/2
8076 2018-05-27 20:45:21 @CanMarFoods Wow, I love the taste of your roasted flax seeds. I thought other flax seeds were tolerable at best, and certainly less musty tasting than flax oil. But I just got your Fee Fi Fo Flax and the taste is so nutty and good. Now my hemp hearts have competition.

8083 2018-05-27 20:43:47 You idiots should both Google How Trump has caused oil prices to skyrocket. Educate your damn selves. Trump supporters are just like Hitler supporters in 1939. Regardless of the wrong he does you only focus on the 1 thing he has done right which is taxes. Amazing

8094 2018-05-27 20:41:48 If the oil were found in Tel Aviv, "Pals" would still claim it was part of their territory.
8095 2018-05-27 20:41:40 One nation (have to remember) almost 100% alternative energy. Oil co propaganda that it can't work. They want to pump last drop of oil,sell natural gas. It's about money.
8096 2018-05-27 20:41:30 And you survived that falafel, great! Indeed street falafel in Egypt could be harmful because of badly maintained oil. In some extreme cases it does not look like or taste like cooking oil any more.

8099 2018-05-27 20:41:15 UAE was developed with the revenue from oil. Nigeria is struggling to fix 'Lagos-Benin' express road for the past 10 years and we've been generating revenue from oil.

8102 2018-05-27 20:41:13 Throw them out of #NATO. We no longer need listening stations on the south of the #USSR. They kill our friends the #Kurds and buy oil from #ISIS. Time to cut off the #Islamist @RT_Erdogan and show him he is an irrelevant dictator. Support the coup.

8107 2018-05-27 20:40:47 The meme that one can crash a Tesla by activating a super-cruise system and taking a nap is banal and yes potentially manipulated by Koch's and allied interests who own oil or protect oil out of (ephemeral American) class solidarity.

8109 2018-05-27 20:40:19 I have major health anxiety, so I can imagine how worried you might be feeling but I think you will be fine. In addition to your medication, I believe they recommend consuming honey, green tea, olive oil, etc to help with treating and curing the infection.
8110 2018-05-27 20:40:14 Oil?
8111 2018-05-27 20:40:10 You know you’re Texan if you pronounce “oil” “ull”

8114 2018-05-27 20:39:43 The best way to hit back would be to get the pipeline built and stop sending trump our oil at a discount.
8115 2018-05-27 20:39:23 This oil export is so uneconomical . 2000 barrels a day is nothing to write home about. All those trucks on the road ; pollution galore. Let the oil stay underground! Don’t export oil for the sake of exporting. There’s nothing unique about exporting oil. It has to make sense!
8116 2018-05-27 20:38:54 Aid is better with billions of dollars in oil sales ?

8131 2018-05-27 20:36:26 John McCain’s wars? Does he own an oil company or a Marc Company? I seem to recall he at least argued against torture. Training young people in the military with fire arms isn’t the same as giving them unlimited access without training. Guns are kept in an armory on post 
8132 2018-05-27 20:36:22 All set for first oil corruption test. They’ll pass - with flying colours!! And you the media, will cheer them on. Tragic!!
8133 2018-05-27 20:36:13 This Complex is a, pretty big issue, that can't get referred about, very blatantly, because It's the whole thing making everything terrible. And terrorism. The military uses a lot of oil
8134 2018-05-27 20:36:10 Suggest you comment on how Jordan and Syria and Egypt treat the 'palestinians'. All I hear is criticism of Israel and false claims that the 'Palestinians 'have any legal right to israel or judea/Samaria.Also how much does the oil rich Arab countries donate to the Palestinians.

8146 2018-05-27 20:34:16 uhh a face cleanser with tea tree oil in it or just tea tree oil helped with that for me!!
8147 2018-05-27 20:34:11 Oh please, we don't get oil from Iran and Oregon is happy to raise taxes on gas.  Grandstanding about the Iran deal just looks pretty and a clear political ploy.
8148 2018-05-27 20:33:52 Let's show him his brand of snake oil doesn't sell in California!
8149 2018-05-27 20:33:48 Prop taxes are predominantly bc prop values r up. I agree with u that higher prices not good for avg consumer...but to say it is not good for “state” of ND is not accurate. Plus normally as oil goes up, dollar goes down...thus typically ag commodity prices up
8150 2018-05-27 20:33:36 Finally put a few drops of my new lime essential oil in my diffuser and it's only been five minutes but I'm already like 
8151 2018-05-27 20:33:22 Again, not wrong but cherry picking your data - oil higher throughout most of past admin, the recent increase doesn’t even get back to highs of ‘11, ‘12, etc.  It is removing hostility to coal that is allowing production to increase.
8152 2018-05-27 20:32:57 Just spitballing here but maybe purchase that yourself, van probably just needs an oil change, and then drive it around NY/NJ this summer as your leisure vehicle when you are working at the Big M.    Sell it back to the Pomp in the fall for double your money. Easy $$$$

8155 2018-05-27 20:32:49 14 just referred to olive oil as "Italian juice", I guess she's not wrong.
8156 2018-05-27 20:32:34 Really? Because the US is Exporting oil - so we have plenty!?! Price gouging I say.

8175 2018-05-27 20:29:07 ?! Sustainable wood use is carbon neutral. In the West most of the wood rots (and produces CO2), the energy is unused - great if we replace oil by it. P.S. I have a phd in environmental sciences + studied engineering, no reason to be sleezy.

8183 2018-05-27 20:28:27 I was out of olive oil. This stuff takes a lot of practise and i'm assuming you know.
8184 2018-05-27 20:28:21 Water systems in Iraq have not been repaired, Iraqis are drinking depleted uranium, contaminated water. Newborns have lots of birth defects. The country is still under sanctions.  Iraqi oil is being siphoned off to Israel, with a gang of US 'enforcers' overseeing the theft.
8185 2018-05-27 20:28:04 Nothing in particular, just anything that supports skin health like antioxidants found in many culinary herbs like turmeric, oregano, etc. Hemp oil is apparently better than fish oil for that so you’re mostly there anyway :3

8196 2018-05-27 20:25:39 No use oil
8197 2018-05-27 20:25:23 The Scottish people made the correct decision Dave. The crashing of the oil price would have plunged an independent Scotland into chaos. We are already running a 9.8 Billion deficit (with Barnett) and are the highest taxed in the U.K, with the worse performing economy in Europe.
8198 2018-05-27 20:25:13 The best friend of the U.S. who buys all the weapons ... and has plenty of oil. And doesn't like Iran. 
8199 2018-05-27 20:25:12 Ron, Ron, Ron, the USA exports oil.  We receive oil from Canada.  Iran is not part of the issue.  You are probably the same person who blamed George Bush for everything.

8214 2018-05-27 20:23:10 It's a product, but its also a heavily TAXED. Federal, State and local tax's on every gallon of gasoline, Diesel, Fuel oil, Propane and so forth.

8222 2018-05-27 20:22:08 Yes. Our gas price is a fair trade for a nuclear Iran. We are the leading oil producer in the world now. The price will come back down.

8224 2018-05-27 20:22:01 "The Cobra" 44' oil pattern with lower than normal volume in the middle but more on the sides. It forces players to adapt quickly to transition or else "get bit" Lower strength balls are your friend in this case
8225 2018-05-27 20:22:00 True terrorism comes from Saudis Arabia, big business especially oil interests and Repulicans in this gov who carry their water. They are selling out for the $$$
8226 2018-05-27 20:21:51 I have now moved the cod liver oil to a different room.
8227 2018-05-27 20:21:50 Yes I too think holding people accountable for their promises is extortion. Personal responsibility and credibility, what're those??
8228 2018-05-27 20:21:41 Absolute bunk...Korea has heavy oil refinery ready to process. Issue is anti-energy govt not price. Simply look at how LNG stalled in Can versus US where exporting and where price same on both sides of border...
8229 2018-05-27 20:21:40 Good luck tonight, you already know how to get it done, go get it again, we all will be cheerin ya on  #ADnation #backtoback
8230 2018-05-27 20:21:20 Or maybe more money for planned parenthood could have fixed this sooner?
8231 2018-05-27 20:21:11 Heads Up, Oil is a product of the Earth you live on, you just happen to make money off of it by making the people need it, because you don't want to offer them other tech that will get them off of it. I really don't think you'll be trucking oil to the Moon and Mars.
8232 2018-05-27 20:21:10 If you're not already frying your eggs in sesame oil, you're missing out
8233 2018-05-27 20:21:10 Trump is sending Ivanka to campaign in California since most Californians can't stomach Donald Trump. We need a PROCLAMATION to Keep THE TRUMPS out of California. We don't like the Trumps. They want to DRILL FOR OIL OFF CALIFORNIA'S BEAUTIFUL COAST #VoteBlue for California.
8234 2018-05-27 20:21:09 Cleasing oil dah nak habis. Someone pls belikan untuk saya 
8235 2018-05-27 20:21:07 As we allow islamic grooming gangs to rape our children and ban reporters from talking about it
8236 2018-05-27 20:20:39 Gotta love the Pacific paradise. In Honolulu you smell coconut oil from the tourists, almost everywhere.
8237 2018-05-27 20:20:30 This is funny. Oil is currently at $67 and Trump supposedly got the Saudis to agree to $80. That is some MAGA deal-making!
8238 2018-05-27 20:20:23 ik a lot of ppl hate on coconut oil but it y has my skin clear and glowing
8239 2018-05-27 20:20:03 Oil wars.

#kenya ni ile ile rich atabaki rich na maskini atazidi kuwa maskini.
8241 2018-05-27 20:19:46 I figure your Iraq is a typo. When the world uses 99%+ of the oil produced each month - every source Country can have an impact on the price of a barrel of oil on the World market. The uncertainty of the Iranian supply is the primary driver of the recent 35% increase in crude oil
8242 2018-05-27 20:19:38 I think all Spitfires up to and including the MkV make that noise, It's due to the small oil cooler radiator under the left wing. After the MkV the oil cooler was made larger and the whistle stopped.
8243 2018-05-27 20:19:35 Hada Labo also has a cleansing oil. It is olive oil based and fragrance feee. I don’t wear make up pero it’s good in removing sunscreen than the CeraVe foaming wash I’m using.
8244 2018-05-27 20:19:33 Yes need to look up board member Julie Wiekel’s opinion on that.
8245 2018-05-27 20:19:25 Did I just understand that Kenya is slated to Export Oil then IMPORT Processed Oil Products? 
Confused big time...
8246 2018-05-27 20:19:23 Sovereign wealth funds so u outlaws as matter of fact!Not ur oil u pump from well in state of Illinois!Currency markets calculated in frauds! Venezuela :euro : counterfeit products by birth certificates. Treason cover all!©®on social security systems Not private!

8251 2018-05-27 20:18:50 Giving Hogg nearly unlimited air time and letting him spew about anything that pops into that pinhead of his is a gift to the opposition.

8253 2018-05-27 20:18:14 #FakeHanSoloFacts to much coconut oil makes you dizzy.
8254 2018-05-27 20:18:04 @PetroleumMin which crude oil we purchase, Brent crude or wti crude.
My question is 
When crude oil prices are reducing from 2 - 3 days why your oil companies are exceeding the rates of petrol and diesel.
You are saying oil prices are on daily basis but from this I don't think so
8255 2018-05-27 20:17:59 Very very thinly sliced par boiled potatoes, then olive oil and rosemary and rock salt... a bit of grated Parmesan cheese near the end.. 
8256 2018-05-27 20:17:55 *HAD lol. And then I had to get an oil change  #adultingsucks lol
8257 2018-05-27 20:17:36 I like to dunk the bread in some flaky salt and cracked pepper after I have dunked it in the oil because I am truly terrible 
8258 2018-05-27 20:17:34 Tomorrow's sectional championship game vs Bishop Noll will be at Oil City Stadium at noon. Enjoy the holiday and come support the Oilers! #MakeItHappen
8259 2018-05-27 20:17:24 Not necessarily for or against the OP. I see both sides.  

But I do know a most jobs do require a u tox:
I had to get pee tested (nurse)
Husband had to (deputy sheriff)
& Son has to (he's 17 yr old getting a p/t job at either a tire or oil change place-both require it)
8260 2018-05-27 20:17:22  Twitter: who uses CBD oil for their dog, & where are you buying it online? Please and thank you. 
8261 2018-05-27 20:17:01 Its BULL SHIT when it involves COLLUSION TRUMP our modern day SNAKE OIL SALESMAN.GREAT MY DAD was great served his country.TRUMPSdad paid for deferrments for junior who was afraid to go.Degenerate trump talks a good game, BUT LOVES THOSE PHOTO OPS.GREATEST BULL SHITTER INTHEWORLD
8262 2018-05-27 20:16:58 You aint tell her to get no coconut oil did you 
8263 2018-05-27 20:16:49 I’ve yet to try that gun oil but I’ve heard things about it though
8264 2018-05-27 20:16:45 No...oil all the way
8265 2018-05-27 20:16:00 Flagler starts this, standard oil company, after ww2 the hotel , the breakers was used as a hospital after ww2. Hitler in the picture makes sense, also the "hunt for hitler" show places him in Venezuela after the war. Rock, vanderbuilts, no morgan , federal reserve starters,
8266 2018-05-27 20:15:53 I heard so many good things about coconut oil that I decided to buy it

i already like it 

even tho I hate coconuts

8270 2018-05-27 20:15:48 Omfg you horrible calculated snake oil salesperson.
8271 2018-05-27 20:15:47 Poles like Iranians because of World War II and buy oil from them so nothing will change unless the US imposes sanctions on Polish companies
8272 2018-05-27 20:15:42 Yea, I'd go with that. Something that's already been disproved.
8273 2018-05-27 20:15:31 Hey, what are the odds that one will shoot an intruder? One in what odds?
8274 2018-05-27 20:15:26 Apparently @RonWyden doesn’t follow the oil markets. Oil fell 4.57% on Friday back to the levels when Trump complained about it a few weeks ago. Fell due to Saudis and Russians deciding to increase output in second half of year. This was due to Trump-Saudi positive relationship
8275 2018-05-27 20:15:24 @GreenPeopleUK I see Palm Oil is one of the ingredients on your baby sun cream, is it a sustainable palm oil?
8276 2018-05-27 20:15:12 There are many patriotic conservatives who recognize Trump & Co for the snake oil operation they are, and, also, the serious national security threat they pose. As someone Left of Center, I stand proudly w/ all patriots, regardless of political alignment.
8277 2018-05-27 20:14:47 i use coconut oil religiously
8278 2018-05-27 20:14:46 Yeah I have an oil that comes with a syringe to feed it to them. And it helps out my old chihuahua who has seizures
8279 2018-05-27 20:14:39 .@CFJC_Today @CBCKamloops @RadioNLNews @KamThisWeek @DonovanCavers Kinder Morgan pipeline pumping station along North Thompson River is experiencing a SPILL.

8280 2018-05-27 20:14:38 Definitely oil subsidies.
The Coast Guard men and women provide protection.
8281 2018-05-27 20:14:33 Don't forget that oil change and grease job, while you are there, Tomcat.
8282 2018-05-27 20:14:19 Great let’s start with everyone at every car, bank & insurance company that received Federal Bailout money.
Then we can move on to any companies that receive govt subsidies of any kind like say Oil and Gas companies etc.
Drug test every single employee.
Sound good Charlie?
8283 2018-05-27 20:14:09 I’ve laid out multiple days since the weather has gotten nice ALL WITH TANNING OIL ON & I haven’t burned once 2018 is a weird year
8284 2018-05-27 20:14:02 I need more peppermint essential oil.
I run out so fast.
8285 2018-05-27 20:14:02 Mind you, that'll be massive self-flagilation for England! Scotland has the oil, gin, vodka, whisky, electricity, computer games, satellites and more! They will trade but yes, Scotland should also engage with the wider world. #scoEU
8286 2018-05-27 20:13:44 Never put more than one drop of lavender oil in your bath. That stuff is potent as all hell.
8287 2018-05-27 20:13:41 If he don't rub in ya tanning oil, he not for u sis
8288 2018-05-27 20:13:39 The increase in gas prices has more to do with the increase in demand caused by a booming economy and not enough refinery capacity to produce gasoline. We have enough oil but we need more refineries.
8289 2018-05-27 20:13:34 Ericsson now has the power of being in too places at once, with Perez complaining he was corner cutting, and the oil was coming out of his car
8290 2018-05-27 20:13:20 Last time I checked ur only relevant for your oil
8291 2018-05-27 20:13:20 The Lac Megantic disaster was caused by highly volatile Bakken field oil from the US. Bitumen could be shipped as solid material, making explosions impossible and spills much easier and safer to handle, plus saving money by not requiring diluent.
8292 2018-05-27 20:13:15 My dad is grilling marinated T-bone steaks for dinner with baked potatoes and asparagus baked in the oven drizzled with oil, salt & pepper 
8293 2018-05-27 20:13:10 You’d have a lot more credibility if you opposed Obama’s endless wars, illegal immigration failures, BP Deepwater Horizon oil explosion in the Gulf, massive oil and chemical spills in Elk River, WV and Kalamazoo, MI, oil train derailments and fires.
8294 2018-05-27 20:13:08 Ayya, I suggest you to try this experiment.
• 60 ml dark corn syrup
• 60 ml dishwashing liquid 
• 60 ml water 
• 60 ml vegetable oil 
• 60 ml rubbing acohol

Do they mix?

8303 2018-05-27 20:11:35 Must have judged the other beaches during the oil spill.  No way Galveston makes top beach otherwise.
8304 2018-05-27 20:11:21 So they exaggerated, which is less an issue than your oil masters covering up climate effects for decades.
8305 2018-05-27 20:11:15 But what about balsamic? Balsamic is a sauce and dressing? It can be mixed with an oil to make a dressing but by itself is used as a sauce for things like caprese? Like who made these rules? I just want to break the box we have all been put in you feel?
8306 2018-05-27 20:11:14 Well then, this is Turkish style olive oil fava beans. Zeytinyağlı bakla. :-)
Take a saucepan, put some olive oil (a layer of 3-4 mm thick. Or depends how you like)
Chop an onion(per half a kilogram or one kilogram of beans), let them fry till their color turn yellowish
Meanwhile

8310 2018-05-27 20:10:54 @sean1967 dude, that's from 2017. Oil is going to drop like a rock with all the projected production
8311 2018-05-27 20:10:49 No
Only cooking oil
8312 2018-05-27 20:10:25 8 out of 10. I didn’t know jojoba oil was a wax or the main ingredient in Korean skin care
8313 2018-05-27 20:10:23 I think they would like 80$ oil but: 1. T has pressured publicly because high gas price comes at political cost 2. KSA as well as other OPEC members understand that too fast, too high tends to mean revert the market killing ec activity

8316 2018-05-27 20:10:12 Where is his gold? Sarkozy got campaign financing from Ghadafi then turned on him. Chins has huge gold deposits, Russia has vast oil deposits. Together they have gold-backed trading currency & going after US petro $. It's taking off too. Trump may well push EU 2 look east

8327 2018-05-27 20:09:07 This slowdown is caused by massive tax reforms and like GST.
As Dust of demontisation is settling and GST is taking shape in economic system, the recorded growth will be phenomenal.
We will touch 8% again before 2019 if oil market get stablized.u can see that graph is increasing

8332 2018-05-27 20:08:18 I think, because of this radical, janky surgery, & these “harvesters”, they aren’t trying to completely eliminate them. But if they do, it will be so they can hunt them. They are hoping to put horse meat on plates. Chemical horse meat maybe for others, but tough sale here.

8337 2018-05-27 20:08:03 The majority ( poor) voted for chavez...    when oil is $100/bbl its easy to hide a corrupt inept Gov with free hand outs.

Maduro would be just as popular if global oil was still at $100/bbl USD. 

 Oil buys votes...

Except when price drops
8338 2018-05-27 20:08:03 How you can expect help from US where their own election is rigged and @realDonaldTrump administration is under Russia gate Probe of Witch Hunt?

8359 2018-05-27 20:05:12 Russia is one of the largest oil producing countries in the world. When crude oil prices rise they put more money in ghier pockets. Turmoil in the Middle East pushes oil costs higher. We just went through this 10 years ago.

8368 2018-05-27 20:04:22 60% of US grid power is generated by nat gas / coal.
EVs only convert 5% of the energy in natgas into vehicle motion vs 25% for gasoline autos.

This means many time the energy fr. nat gas & coal needed to replace energy from oil using EVs.

8369 2018-05-27 20:04:21 That is a fact. Agree with you fully that oil-for-debt regime is generally unsustainable w/o substantial domestic tradeoffs. Understand BW also, as well as argument for classic Au standard. Concerned about Au-system w/i context of geopol differences then versus now. 1/2

8375 2018-05-27 20:03:26 We’ve given 50 years of Oil/Gas revenue to Westminster to be squandered
We never get the Government we vote for, ie. we never vote Tory
We are now being dragged out of the EU, 62% voted Remain
1999 Westminster moved seabed boundary further north to steal Oil/Gas

8400 2018-05-27 20:00:01 You chop some herbs like rosemary and thyme, some garlic and mix them with olive oil.
Then you clean the fish, remove the insides, the scales and the fins (look up how to do it maybe) and stuff them with the herbs. The fish I used are called gilt-head breams.
8401 2018-05-27 20:00:01 I make big salads (which never contain lettuce) with things like quinoa, corn, peppers, tomatoes or a greek-style with peppers, feta, onions, cucumbers; also coleslaw with ginger and sesame oil and garlic and rice vinegar. And I cook up plain proteins like chicken, steak, eggs.
8402 2018-05-27 19:59:59 People need to understand oil is on the verge of becoming an obsolete energy source and invest in the renewable energy and technology of TOMORROW instead of yesterday.

8455 2018-05-27 19:53:09 Prices tend to be lower in the south than west coast. Partial reason is because more oil shipping routes are bound for the east coast. Add that to the states gas tax and you have your answer. The gas tax is coupled with tolls to go towards roads and projects.

8476 2018-05-27 19:50:32 A slightly risk-averse mood again, this time fuelled by politics in Spain and Italy. The S&P500 closed down 0.2%, the US dollar rose, and US bond yields fell. Oil fell 3%-4% after supply comments from Saudi Arabia and Russia.
8477 2018-05-27 19:50:25 My “interpretation” is that people were asked a simple question and then told that they’d answered a complicated one. Every snake oil salesman that comes on TV says that whatever their”interpretation” is, is what the “British People” voted for - it was and is a con.

8494 2018-05-27 19:47:22 Kinder Morgan pipeline pumping station along the North Thompson River is experiencing a SPILL. The air is filled with the stench of oil and chemicals. Oil most likely will enter the river! Darfield, BC about 80kms northeast of Kamloops. #cdnpoli #StopKM #bcpoli

8497 2018-05-27 19:47:05 Resources. England doesn't need Irish peat. But oil, water, electricity, food...that's a different story.
8498 2018-05-27 19:46:50 And will they follow their example country ...ie.New Zealand  ...who are now banning off shore gas and oil drilling ?...
8499 2018-05-27 19:46:48 keep seeing these adverts on instagram about this brand that sells stuff to make you tan quicker. u do realise that its basically just oil and all ur doing is frying urself

8503 2018-05-27 19:46:06 Iain, fiscal austerity is not what @NicolaSturgeon envisages. This report is tactical, in the way that any has to be pre Indy. It will be up to the first SG post-Indy to decide on policy. This report shows Indy feasible even with Gers figures and no oil. Unionists are furious!
8504 2018-05-27 19:46:06 Note to friends - the easiest way to remove sticky residue from labels/tags is spray coconut oil from Trader Joes.  I tried warm soapy water, olive/canola oil, no luck - spray coconut oil - sticky gone in an instant!
8505 2018-05-27 19:45:54 Boots and coats do wear out. No pun intended. In an ideal world, I would agree. I would dare to say that even the corporate world agree to cut down emissions. Either we pay more taxes to go green or we sell more oil to go green, I’d prefer to sell more oil.
8506 2018-05-27 19:45:25 ben voyons, en attendant que ces gens cessent leurs taxes et impôts en particulier le gaz oil et le tabac qui frappe en premier les plus démunis
8507 2018-05-27 19:45:19 Slathered my face in bio oil to try to get that even skin tone I am desperate for
8508 2018-05-27 19:45:19 I don’t have a skin routine. And i don’t take care of my skin as good as i should. This is just nature doing it’s thizzle keeping my face above water. 

But i do only use unscented sensitive dove BAR soap on my face to wash it. And organic coco oil afterwards.
8509 2018-05-27 19:45:19 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
8510 2018-05-27 19:44:58 I would choose America but I can't drill oil.
8511 2018-05-27 19:44:55 Chug as much water as possible for the next few days and try not to put any chemicals on it. Use coconut oil as a moisturizer. It should reduce redness and swelling and make the skin repair faster

8513 2018-05-27 19:44:44 Rustic ciabatta with brie, sundried tomato, olive oil, basil and ground pepper. This machine is awesome.
8514 2018-05-27 19:44:43 Keep whining about gas prices while real problems are being solved. Let’s hope we are not as oil dependent in the future.
8515 2018-05-27 19:44:42 An abomination.  Call your legislators and tell them what you think. The squeaky wheel gets the oil. Doing nothing is not an option.
8516 2018-05-27 19:44:39 which is why Olive oil is so expensive
8517 2018-05-27 19:44:39 Rub on some oil and call it a day! 
8518 2018-05-27 19:44:33 I thought that was Barack Obama and the internet video that caused Benghazi.
8519 2018-05-27 19:44:10 does anyone else ever report a bunch of n*zis but give up because there are just too many of them? it feels like i’m trying to clean up an oil spill with a little square of toilet paper
8520 2018-05-27 19:43:51 It definitely does not need either one or the other.  Just real Greek yoghurt,  grated cucumber, squeezed very well in muslin,fresh garlic, salt, lemon juice and a dash of good olive oil
8521 2018-05-27 19:43:50 Extra virgin oil!
8522 2018-05-27 19:43:45 The old Illuminati jew and creator of 9/11 and Iraqi oil war is intending to depart before his own father?

8524 2018-05-27 19:43:40  you’re going to love the mask and oil! Thank you!
8525 2018-05-27 19:43:33 Careful what you wish for mate. If they aren't talking about their vinyl they might start boring the cocks off us about their saffron quinoa recipes, artisan pale ales and beard oil. Fucking pricks.

8537 2018-05-27 19:40:52 We also left a trail of oil all the way back to the pits. We were popular that day.
8538 2018-05-27 19:40:51 F-sake! Had a cousin in NI put away for having an oil rag...to them it was a "terrorists act". He didn't speak for years after his release! Someone has to help this man!!!
8539 2018-05-27 19:40:45 Like is for brutal exposure. If viewers find this *difficult* to watch, imagine being "the patient."
8540 2018-05-27 19:40:40 I agree but number 4 can you make an exception as being vegetarian in the UK taco bell is not veggie friendly :( they use the same oil

8544 2018-05-27 19:39:39 Everybody recall that Jim Bakker's prison release included a ban from preaching for life. He got this amended. I won't quarrel with the 2nd court on constitutionality. Regardless, I dare anyone to question the 1st on morality. Bakker is a snake oil salesman: just right for Trump.
8545 2018-05-27 19:39:21 IM DUPPY FREESTYLE DRAKE DID IS STRAIGHT GASOLINE/DIESEL/CRUDE OIL YOU FUCKING NAME IT

8547 2018-05-27 19:38:58 Exactly. If they want to be a citizen do it legally.
8548 2018-05-27 19:38:57 I'd bet that oil originated in Canada.
8549 2018-05-27 19:38:48 No oil. Fry that rice

8551 2018-05-27 19:38:20 "A Martian watching the oil market from outer space during the past few months will have noticed one thing above all else..There is no...imbalance of supply and demand." >300 MILLION missing barrels says otherwise. Maybe it was the Martians who done took 'em!
Please, investigate.
8552 2018-05-27 19:38:12 No, water will just make it hard and hard to chew, use cooking oil instead
8553 2018-05-27 19:38:10 In fact. The murder of a federal judge, after the murder of a step daughter and lover of an estranged wife. Davis Oil. Oh and then there was the murder for hire case against the texas Judge.   Yeah. Empower Texans is impressively irrelevent.
8554 2018-05-27 19:38:03 Get the glycolic lactic acid mask by Ren OR Babyfacial by Sukari and then the UFO oil by Sunday Riley and thank me later

8558 2018-05-27 19:37:14 OPEC yrs ago set the price really low on a barrel of oil and our gas price went to $2 gal OPEC was going to let it go back to $100 per barrel & so our Price rose to $3 gal Trump said it was unreasonable now they are stopping at $80 & Oregon like CA tax gas higher for lib agendas.
8559 2018-05-27 19:36:53 I think a better one is having a car where the exhaust is blowing a little and the horn has stopped working and desperately trading it in for any other car because 'it's a different car' but not looking at the pool of oil that's gathered underneath their new wheels
8560 2018-05-27 19:36:42 Breitbart.....I’m outtie!  Later, buddy! 
8561 2018-05-27 19:36:39 Empower texans is 9 rich extremists donating 90% of the funding and kess than 200 others donating 10%.  Radically right, narrowly defined christianity. Extreme gun positions.  But mostly a cover for fracking and oil and gas opportunists. 1 major donor source got away with murder
8562 2018-05-27 19:36:38 You know that there's a lot of 'people's' money there, that's what has attracted them, they won't stop until they've wrecked it, they'll finish. Add that to all their IGRs, crude oil prices etc but no visible development & you wonder what they need pensioners' for. Sad
8563 2018-05-27 19:36:37 The sad and funny thing is that "their" money is from oil and not football
8564 2018-05-27 19:36:24 Yes! With salt and a drizzle of good olive oil
8565 2018-05-27 19:36:24 That is brilliant, and that is your boat that you have spoken about.
The scenery looks really nice. Did you see my picture of Barney ?

8567 2018-05-27 19:35:57 You don't know the cost of the oil in my Alabaster Box!

Happy Sunday!!!!
8568 2018-05-27 19:35:50 I think this focus of Venezuela serves British interests. Highlighting the real/ alleged abuses opens door for sanctions so Venezuela under Chavez and Maduro will not succeed and become an example to others. It prepares for regime change that would bring back control of Vz's oil.
8569 2018-05-27 19:35:50 59 Scottish Parliamentary seats? Revenue generated from Oil & Gas, Renewables, Scotch Whisky, Food & Drink sector OR our charm, can't make up my mind which 
8570 2018-05-27 19:35:49 Once I realized the hotels will room service you free olive oil, I stopped packing lotion. Instantly that much space left for something else important in my luggage.
8571 2018-05-27 19:34:44 heat some water up in the kettle to a boil, pour it in the bottle and go do something for a few minutes. Come back and wipe off the glue. If you need to, use some citrus oil based cleaner to get what's left.
8572 2018-05-27 19:34:31 Snake oil.
8573 2018-05-27 19:34:24 idk if u get this company in america but the body shop’s banana shampoo/conditioner has been a god send for me bc its so gentle and deep cleansing w/ my hair (its super thick and hard to manage) and their coconut oil tames my frizz so well

8577 2018-05-27 19:34:01 We are in Nigeria, that's our excuse. We defy every logic in the book. We have crude oil yet don't refine, we produce graduates for other countries, we have lots of intelligent people, yet elect the dull ones.
8578 2018-05-27 19:33:38 Yip  I do one with no oil 
8579 2018-05-27 19:33:11 What whack-job! Can any sane person really believe Trump is The President Of The United States? Mixing Memorial Day and Trump is like trying to mix oil and water.......it doesn’ work.
8580 2018-05-27 19:33:07 Hair oil: I can never seem to find the sweet, shiny-yet-lightweight spot between hay stack and greaser. 
8581 2018-05-27 19:33:06 I hate getting the oil changed in my car. 
8582 2018-05-27 19:32:23 Sir jung lagi hai jung dimag mein, yaha rahegi to ragad ke nukalenge tarpin oil se isilye videsh gai hai 
8583 2018-05-27 19:32:01 0.0 to do with oil prices. If Iran needed more $ due to no more free cash from America they would export more oil.....nice try though swing and miss.
8584 2018-05-27 19:31:47 Why are we sending aid to Mexico and calling them friends and an ally? The whole damn country outside of Fed District and resorts, lawless.

8588 2018-05-27 19:30:07 SO GUILTY. I just learned about the term #silverlakeshaman. Into palo santo (oil version), making skin creams (shea butter style), homebrewed kombucha, living in a dome in the Mojave Desert, cacti... it hits closer than I want to admit.
8589 2018-05-27 19:29:52 If not Biafran oil, this Nigeria, Nigeria, Nigeria, i love Nigeria, i love Nigeria, Nigeria is for all of us, Nigeria! Nigeria! Nigeria, all this will just end overnight, just One Nigeria in Biafran oil, nothing more.
8590 2018-05-27 19:29:42 Ugh I hate that stuff. Olive oil tends to work better for me, largely because it doesn't make me want to claw my ears off 
8591 2018-05-27 19:28:58 For the garlic bread, add olive oil, a little butter and crushed garlic cloves to a bowl and microwave for 30sec-1min. Stir after heating very well and brush on both sides of 1in-2in toast. Place on aluminum foil and place in cooking pan and broil for 5 mins. 
Enjoy!
8592 2018-05-27 19:28:51 Then act to protect PHL oil/gas exploration and fishing rights, first and foremost by clarifying that US consider Mutual Defense Treaty to apply to attacks on any PHL vessels in its EEZ. And no, PHL isn't the only defeatist claimant, but it has been the most for last 2 yrs.

Oil coated his fingers and forehead from where he previously wiped his brow, and his shirt was sporting a few stains,»

8600 2018-05-27 19:27:48 I think it looks like Hines but again I’m trying to get a better copy.
8601 2018-05-27 19:27:47 Trump is a low class  snake oil & traitorous con-man who has been usurping the American tax payers money to provide a life style he can afford. Justice will have have thug 45 kicking & screaming on his perp fall & drag out of shame. A grand vision of orange color splattering!
8602 2018-05-27 19:27:41 Before 2014 you were like, Govt is betraying us by increasing fuel prices. Now I want to ask what is happening now.We know about the value of crude oil of then and now so please don't make that an excuse.
8603 2018-05-27 19:27:27 Yes lad we need a oil barons or a country lol not someone has a few pound who look for bargain buys, they don't all pay off,
8604 2018-05-27 19:27:22 Tum kon ho gasti ki bachi jo rozon main b baz nai a rahi lagta hy tumhari gand main bohat khujli hoti hy kisi din mari pary gi oil lga kar
8605 2018-05-27 19:27:15 Olive oil mnatse 
8606 2018-05-27 19:27:11 Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran deal helps the oil barons while hurting his countrymen. The timing of the move coninsides with both OPEC and Russia cutting production, driving prices up; emptying the pockets of Americans and filling theirs.
8607 2018-05-27 19:27:05 Norway has a state oil company.  Therein lies the difference.  Scottish firms are leaving Scotland due to constitutional uncertainty, which the YES movement stirs up repeatedly.
8608 2018-05-27 19:26:41 Who’s freedom are they fighting for? Aren’t they really there for oil? Just tell the #Truth !
8609 2018-05-27 19:26:31 Bhaiya crude oil ka dam kaha hai. International market me crude ka dam malum hai na woh dekhiye. Tab aap ko samajh me ajayega asli baat. Tab up samajh jayenge ki subsidy ke paisa kaba gaya
8610 2018-05-27 19:25:56 It would probably have a similar cost, but since gas has to be transported everywhere anyways, whereas crude oil doesn’t, it’s adding an extra cost to ship the crude oil, just to turn around and ship the gas again
8611 2018-05-27 19:25:45 Yes, very clear that this is because multi-national companies, headquartered outside Scotland operate in the NS. This is not the equivalent of money being funneled to the elite. It's how the oil industry operates. The only way to stop this would be to nationalise it.
8612 2018-05-27 19:25:43 The Iranian leadership was chanting "Death to Israel" when they were smuggling oil through Israel too. Corrupt cronies everywhere working against their own peoples and generally lying.

8615 2018-05-27 19:25:09 OMFG of course he does. Oil, for starters. You think the Obama restrictions didn't chap Putin's dick? Wtf dude.
8616 2018-05-27 19:25:04 I’ve discovered that Dijon mustard mixed with dark soy sauce and a little olive oil creates a dressing that taste a bit like oyster sauce. 
8617 2018-05-27 19:24:54 Watching Giuliana's doubletalk and backing up was hilarious this morning, except that it was so disturbing. Not sure how @DanaBashCNN kept a straight face interviewing him. She stumped him on every question. Logic and lies are like oil and water.
8618 2018-05-27 19:24:49 I couldn’t take a pic but Rolls sport with “SA OIL” as number plate in Ascot.

8620 2018-05-27 19:24:33 I think hers is perfume oil. Need the type they use in soap making.
8621 2018-05-27 19:24:23 I'll add a 3rd. not just oil and gas and financial services but petrochemicals, professional services and whisky – are owned outside of Scotland. So although the products or services may be made here in Scotland, the income doesn’t necessarily stay in Scotland.
8622 2018-05-27 19:24:16 You do know the US can supply 100% of our own oil now if need be?  We don’t need Middle East oil.
8623 2018-05-27 19:23:56 The poisonous substance in Poison Ivy is an oil.

Wash the effected area with blue Dawn liquid. A lot of it. All of it.

8629 2018-05-27 19:22:02 We were buying gas from Iran? Not that I know of. The reason Iran gave for needing nuc. power was to offset their lack of oil! Our Allies are all the middle east countries that have "big" oil reserves. The same Allies that BHO gave the middle finger too! More made up s..t!
8630 2018-05-27 19:21:54 There is olive oil with it. Lol

Good for the heart
8631 2018-05-27 19:21:51 No, I'm really not. You prove you don't read anything. 
'For example, whilst the North Sea has undoubtedly had a major positive impact on Scotland’s economy, the high level of ownership amongst oil and gas operators means that many of the profits flow out of Scotland' 1/2
8632 2018-05-27 19:21:47 Really?! How? I’ve used them in oil and teas over the years after I got past just looking at their beautiful flowers.
8633 2018-05-27 19:21:40 So the entire American  oil industry and all American auto manufacturers fall under that umbrella...

8637 2018-05-27 19:21:23 Speak 4 yourself regarding women. Not one woman I know voted for Hillary Clinton due to her RECORD on issues such as the TPP, War, Wall St Corruption, the dreadful Welfare 'Reform' Bill, Oil Pipelines, Marriage Equality, too late, Fracking, Centrism is not Democratic
8638 2018-05-27 19:21:19 Or oil any large CO2 emitter. Like say, a cement factory of NG plant. It's clear you have no tangible solutions, and only want to vilify the Oilsands. You have the same empty tired talking points, and use pejorative terms like Tarsands (tar is predominantly made from Coal).

8641 2018-05-27 19:21:05 W/E Wrap:
A calm end to the week for equities and currencies, but a panicked end for oil markets - Brent Crude tumbling by 3%. News out of Italy this morning  - new Government has not been confirmed.
8642 2018-05-27 19:21:02 I once threw washing up liquid instead of cooking oil in absentmindedly!!! Same dish I put a tablespoon of chilli flakes instead of a teaspoon. Biggest disaster I had!
8643 2018-05-27 19:20:52 This chick was at the shop oil super dirt and she been putting regular oil in her car and it takes full synthetic

8646 2018-05-27 19:20:45 Thanks. She worked for them a couple years ago. She got tired of it thankfully, though now she’s a molecule marker chemist for local oil refinery...trade awful for really bad I guess.
8647 2018-05-27 19:20:34 Use a diffuser to diffuse a natural oil made for sleep. I have one called “calm” and “sleep.” You could use lavender as well. I also have use lavender baby wash in the shower before bed and I have lavender lotion I put on as well.
8648 2018-05-27 19:20:23 1 brush will last a lifetime in my craft, no deforestation for paper or wars over oil to drive cars. Tell me who is more environmentally friendly on animal rights? #opendata #smartcities #bigdata #ai
8649 2018-05-27 19:20:09 Why do y’all women wait untill 30 k miles to get a oil change
8650 2018-05-27 19:19:52 I know plenty of people in the commodity world.
We are awash in oil. Oil should be under $20/ barrel right now.
Speculation drives prices.
Nothing more.
8651 2018-05-27 19:19:36 1 more thing... when our intel community starts to see a FOREIGN adversary meddling around in our business, they should be watching / following them. If Americans are POSSIBLY doing something wrong, you can’t look at it like what Nixon did. He did it to win an election!

8653 2018-05-27 19:18:51 because of the tech others and myself developed, oil booms will be a thing of the past (barring wars that disrupt 2+MMBPD over night), so instead of AB having a trillion dollar heritage fund, we have a 100B in debt. BC and Ontario are wrecked. The federal government is a disaster

8656 2018-05-27 19:18:08 Wen u say invest in schools it's a good idea Bt many kids now due to our ways don't believe in education being necessary for a productive future.

8657 2018-05-27 19:18:08 no bread or olive oil? Disappointing...
8658 2018-05-27 19:18:03 I really need to learn how to do my own oil changes
8659 2018-05-27 19:18:02 Ron Wyden you are ridiculous. What a nonsensical tweet. Has no relation whatsoever to President Trump. I didn’t hear you complaining about $140 oil when Obama was president. Hypocrite is too nice a word for you. Blame the democratic socialists srunning Oregon into the ground.
8660 2018-05-27 19:17:56 Just remembered I put oil on and now my dumbass sitting outside

8665 2018-05-27 19:17:30 When I were a wee fellow all we had for breakfast was a seller of snake oil, and we were lucky if we got a toothpick in the eyeball for dinner!

8667 2018-05-27 19:17:27 Also, cannabis is legal in So Cal, as well as CBD which has no psychoactive effect. I make a medicated coconut oil which I'll mix into dinner, or spread on a cracker or piece of toast. I have terrible bedtime anxiety/insomnia, but cannabis helps so much!
8668 2018-05-27 19:17:09 Looks like the only way Alberta is going to get oil to tide water is by becoming the 51st state of the US.
8669 2018-05-27 19:17:09 sir all is good, but i dont understand why oil pricing is going up always ?
8670 2018-05-27 19:16:56 I tried frying scrambled eggs in the pan it canton's oil packet + margarine and idk if it was a good or bad idea because it's really good and crusty but the pan is hell to clean
8671 2018-05-27 19:16:55 @USAmbIndia Sir I would like to request you why crude oil price increases very repeadly. Kindly request to the president of america to curb the priceses. I hope you will help us to resolve the matter as a big brother. GOD BLESS YOU & Great America!
8672 2018-05-27 19:16:41 "Are you kidding? It's fun to get your hands dirty every once in a while." He said as he took a second sip of his latte. "After I put the organ back together I had to oil the generator using the special oil that they use. It's an electromechanical organ. Sounds beautiful though."
8673 2018-05-27 19:16:21 I think cutting off oil product supplies to Vancouver (or is it Bc) would have a bigger effect on Alberta than BC.

Can't see oil companies onboard with this.
8674 2018-05-27 19:16:12 Yes ideally, but what use is for the oil to be moved to the east? It’ll just be refined and then shipped back around costing extra unnecessary tax payer money. Like I said, cars don’t run on crude oil 
8675 2018-05-27 19:15:26 I don't believe a word Giuliani said. In the Nixon investigation was going on they didn't go right to it? It took a couple of years and they took everyone down around Nixon first, including the Vice President. Giuliani is a snake oil salesmen and he must be involved.

so much to do.

8681 2018-05-27 19:14:55 Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are the two effective "natural" sunscreens, and they work just fine, but some of the kids' hippie versions are super greasy for some reason. If you put it on the kid right before they go outside they're covered in oil and basically cook
8682 2018-05-27 19:14:44 Isn't that kid's 15 minutes up?
8683 2018-05-27 19:14:32 Almost added cooking oil instead of rooh afza in the blender. That’s how great my life is going these days 
8684 2018-05-27 19:14:26 Since cars don’t run on crude oil, We don’t need to move it all around the country. Refine it where it’s made, and then move the petrol around which is muchhhh cheaper
8685 2018-05-27 19:14:17 Oil sector decline impacted my work. Not the NDP taxation.
8686 2018-05-27 19:14:07 Gas is $2.70 per gal here in FL without factoring the big drop in oil on Friday. Wyden might want to check the states gas tax policy
8687 2018-05-27 19:14:00 One way to prevent cardiovascular disease is to include Olive Oil in your diet. #OliveOil #HealthyHeart
8688 2018-05-27 19:13:57 I just got an oil change and the service advisor tried to downsell(?) me to a normal oil change instead of severe. He didn’t believe that I do 3,000 miles/month and I had to literally pull out my phone to calculate this for his dumb ass.

8693 2018-05-27 19:13:43 @BBCBreaking arent u guys going to cover the brazilia truck 7days strike at Brazil? Most of Capitals without fuel/oil for four days! National media sucks covering it!!!
8694 2018-05-27 19:13:34 if you paid attention and did some research, you'd understand.
8695 2018-05-27 19:13:30 I don’t like driving enough to do 40k miles in a year . And I’d hate to spend that much on oil changes and shit in a single year!
8696 2018-05-27 19:13:21 Lots of olive oil helps with ear wax blockage but an infection needs antibiotics really 
8697 2018-05-27 19:13:19 & the whole point of this conversation was rising gas prices  exporting our oil will help the oil industry, but not necessarily our gas prices go down. Which is why transportation within Canada, and refining within Canada, in Alberta rather than the east, will lower gas prices
8698 2018-05-27 19:13:17 And bottom line ... even Nunes walked away from that meeting last week and didn’t say a word. You need to come to terms with the reality Trump and his people might be guilty. Might! The Russian narrative is backed up with a lot facts at this point. Just no smoking gun...yet!

8704 2018-05-27 19:12:21 1.  We’re  a lot more about domestic oil these days, instead of opec.  2.  It’s summer and rural ergo supply and demand.  3.  You’re way above the national average, so it might be additional fees and taxes by green Oregon raising the price.

8711 2018-05-27 19:11:57 Coconut oil is really doing wonders for my face. The breakouts I get from it being sensitive are almost all cleared up and I've noticed the dryness and smoothness is getting better.

8713 2018-05-27 19:11:40 More time should be spent on what happens to them on the way. Especially the "pretty ones."

8714 2018-05-27 19:11:01 Greatest essential oil blend in the universe: time oil, space oil, reality oil, power oil, soul oil, and mind oil. Place in the infinity diffuser and snap your fingers.
8715 2018-05-27 19:10:58 Thank you!
8716 2018-05-27 19:10:55 Yeah but one of the main reasons why Energy East was being created was so that we could refine our own oil to use here. Europe takes a lot of its oil from the Middle East, whereas Canada exports mainly to the US and recently a lot to China, making a west coast pipeline better
8717 2018-05-27 19:10:54 Rfk jr had more brains than the other Kennedy’s. Quit politics and started delivering cut rate home heating oil. He did a lot of the deliveries to people’s homes himself here in Massachusetts. A good guy. Hated what the Dems have become.
8718 2018-05-27 19:10:46 I’m about to use it. Have some ciabatta, emmental, tomatoes and olive oil. Bit of pepper. Marvellous.

8725 2018-05-27 19:09:20 This very peculiar relationship, based on the oil revenue control from Tripoli, always distorted the political relations in the country, between society, expressed frm benghazi, and government, expressed frm Tripoli. Benghazi is a melting pot frm all of Libya, socially connected
8726 2018-05-27 19:09:08 Hey stupid oil was down sharply on Friday.
8727 2018-05-27 19:09:07 White bro in Whole Foods who exhibited no interest in the fiddlehead ferns until I reached for them: “How do you cook these?”

Me: “You want the big, firm ones. Sauté in a little olive oil.” 

Me: Waits for White Bro to leave before plucking the young, tender ones for myself.
8728 2018-05-27 19:08:58 Nothing like a democrat "fuel pandering" for election when they never bring up the Federal, State, Local taxes attached to each gallon of fuel 
And the oil companies are always the "bad guys"
8729 2018-05-27 19:08:49 More tips for clear skin 

•tea tree oil: dab small amount on affected area w/cotton ball or q-tip and leave on during the night
•egg whites: separate egg white from yolk ;leave on for 20 minutes and rinse off 
•baking soda: mix w/water to create paste.10-15minutes

8732 2018-05-27 19:08:22 Etsy is jammed with vag eggs now. I just reported a slew of them (found them using searches "jade eggs" and "yoni eggs.") It's against Etsy's TOU for making false medical claims yet the snake oil fills up with no oversight by Etsy.

8734 2018-05-27 19:08:12 Nearly all oil producing nations sell licenses to foreign companies.  Where they choose to HQ their business is up to them.  You are manufacturing a grievance.
8735 2018-05-27 19:08:09 Even before Fracking it was said that with sensible usage the US could supply its oil demand within its borders? You guys drinking it like water? Irony being you now get it through your water table through fracking

1) Foreign policy that causes oil prices to spike
2) Let Kim Jong treat him like a trained monkey
3) Increase the national debt by trillions
4) Puppet of Putin
5) Allow China to take the world leadership role away from the USA
8741 2018-05-27 19:07:07 The internet is overflooded with negativity lately. Be it activists of this side or the opposite, hatred births more hatred and fighting evil with devil is just pouring oil into flames. Good luck in your stupid wars and leave me out of it.
8742 2018-05-27 19:07:01 I've no idea why, it's delicious (steamed and with a bit of yoghurt/olive oil/mustard/sugar/lemon juice/salt dressing is even better)
8743 2018-05-27 19:06:57 Dealerships have the best oil.
8744 2018-05-27 19:06:50 Things I heard today...."coconut oil is really bad for your anus." Turns out I misheard but I will never look at a coconut the same.

8747 2018-05-27 19:06:36 I agree it doesn’t fix anything. Jody brought up the point that the Dem party was the party of slavery blah blah blah and that assertion just drives me crazy! It’s flat out propaganda & someone who doesn’t know anything & sees her memes etc might believe it. It’s not right!
8748 2018-05-27 19:06:35 wish they’d stop  bulldozing the orangutans’ forests there replacing them with palm oil plantations
8749 2018-05-27 19:06:34 Whole story is fake and misleading. National Review has breakdown of numbers. Propaganda to gin up outrage over immigration in general.
8750 2018-05-27 19:06:25 That's simply nonsense. Personally I wouldn't have privatised BP, but Scottish firms can and do bid for North Sea works. Fact remains many, many oil companies are multinationals.
8751 2018-05-27 19:06:23 he doesn't insist that they write what he wants. but to be honest. and not lie. and the money on the oil industry side is massive, compared to that, tesla's a tiny fart. and it shows in f.e. the mostly very dishonest articles from @business amongst others.

8759 2018-05-27 19:05:12 Widen I am an economist and spent years working for a major oil company ur ignorance of oil pricing shows me ur political if any thing screams how super ignorance oil pricing are reflective of Econ 101 supply and demand I think by ur political statements or trump and pricesstupid
8760 2018-05-27 19:04:55 Democrats always wanted to hike oil prices to save the world. Now Wyden wants to stay Iran deal to keep oil prices low. How nice!
8761 2018-05-27 19:04:55 Yet you have demanded to stop oil exploration, drilling, pipelines, oil terminals, rail transport, and refineries, all the while squawking about "climate change" the great fraud of the past three decades.
8762 2018-05-27 19:04:51 That last scene , Ronny put some oil on his daughter hair  why so cute ? Just imagine if Tiger shroff have a daughter soon? Hailaa. Such a cute father he will be. And strong. Haha. Never expect #Baaghi2 will be such an emotional movie. Waiting for #Baaghi3. 
8763 2018-05-27 19:04:27 @tweetman5000000 bought some ancient mink oil once and it turns out I’ve used it every winter since. Thanks Mitchy!

8765 2018-05-27 19:04:13 Hahahaha u drilled all the oil from her and gave her acid
8766 2018-05-27 19:04:08 I wouldn't say Canada puts out fake news, but all media whether it be print, radio or TV definitely puts a spin on a story to make it interesting to the audience. Some reporters in the past, misquoted officials on accidents, reporting in barrels not litres when oil spills happen.
8767 2018-05-27 19:04:01 It has nothing to do with Trump, but keep trying, you do realize gas goes up this time of year all the time, for summer travel, and even when oil was in the 65$ per barrel, it was still hovering around 279 a gallon.  States show lower taxes.

8773 2018-05-27 19:03:09 @TheBushCenter Please my beloved brother and friend intervene on behalf of the the elders and the oil company's because the elders and I are about to release all hell on their families/CEOs and their businesses as we're not taking this s*** no more....
8774 2018-05-27 19:03:00 Curses! That was a bottle of olive oil!
8775 2018-05-27 19:02:52 I drove by my old chevron today with glee knowing I never have to give a dollar to the oil people again. Too bad #SaudiArabia #Venezuela #russia and fracking.
8776 2018-05-27 19:02:48 Ive been taking tumeric tablets and cod liver oil. Im only on hydroxychloriquine and im ok most of the time (sore foot after a shift..but can take that) xx
8777 2018-05-27 19:02:46 I changed the oil, spark plugs and emptied the petrol tank in my 1929 Austin Seven today. I bet someone in London was doing that on a Sunday in 1964. But it wouldn't have taken them 2 hours ....

8780 2018-05-27 19:02:39 Oil companies are corrupt just like power companies. Pay it or do without. Oil companies and the politicians they prop up are the worst. The higher the gas price is, the more tax revenue the government brings in. No way should Americans be paying such high gas prices.
8781 2018-05-27 19:02:31 Nah. Depends on circumstances. Thinking UK govt would've  given  up 30% land, 60% sea territory, fisheries, oil, nukes & UNSC seat on 1 vote majority w/o a possible recount. Really?? Now that is daft.
8782 2018-05-27 19:02:29 He has a point when the BBC keeps running negative EV articles, the fact that the world-wide version of BBC website is heavily reliant on oil advertising is entirely coincidental I'm sure...
8783 2018-05-27 19:02:23 I'm in the hospital waiting room because I burnt my eye with frying oil, it hurts like hell, I can't see clearly, the wi-fi sucks major balls and I'm still checking for news every 5 minutes. I can't wait to see a trending hashtag.
8784 2018-05-27 19:02:17 WRONG!  Trump made deal with Saudi Arabia to pick up slack of Iran oil in exchange for cutting off IRAN. OIL Futures will level off b/c there will be No impact on oil prices. Check out how much of that $/gal goes to the liberal state to pay for their entitlement policies?

8790 2018-05-27 19:01:24 Too much oil/butter. Try less, and leave it more in the oven until it becomes more crisp and less moist. Also, use better lighting and angle for shooting.

8808 2018-05-27 18:59:31 the campaign against "drinking oil" (aka bulletproof coffee) is fucking annoying. the idea every morsel that goes in your mouth needs to be nutrient dense protein is goofy. a 300 cal bulletproof can hold me for hours, I have excess fat to burn still. they would rather me starve
8809 2018-05-27 18:59:30 Not enough oil

8811 2018-05-27 18:59:20 You Democrats were purposely going after the gas and oil industry WANTING to make us pay how they do in Europe to 'save' us all.  As usual, Democrats are totally dishonest. Its disgusting really. #WornOutTactics #PTDS #NiceTry #DemocratsHateAmerica #TurnItRed

8814 2018-05-27 18:58:44 I didn't blame Obama for the high gas prices, so it's hard to blame Trump.  A barrel of oil went down last Thursday and Friday but of course we won't see it till middle of the week because of a holiday weekend when so many are driving cars.
8815 2018-05-27 18:58:33 It's already deligitimatzed if the intent is investigate all things Russian in election and no investigation of ppl we know bought intel

8821 2018-05-27 18:56:43 I could never understand why Scotland wasn't crazy about us; our politicians have always had their good will, and oil and minerals, at heart.

8825 2018-05-27 18:56:20 What about funding more "conservative" oïl & gas / infrastructure projects for African countries with blatant needs! e.g Nigeria electrical coverage is only 45% + they need modern refineries
8826 2018-05-27 18:56:16 Them oil productions need to get it together cause we can’t afford to put up with the high ass gas prices
8827 2018-05-27 18:56:11 Whoa whoa whoa... He's also fucking with every oil producing nation in the middle east, doing favors for Russia's oil based economy, AND he fucked up the Iran deal. It takes a whole lot more than just China to spike oil so fast. Give the man some credit!
8828 2018-05-27 18:55:58 they shouldn't leave the country. They should have ankle bracelets on.

8836 2018-05-27 18:54:50 No. Oont ke muh mein jeera ho jayega. Restaurant bill tax will not make a dent to oil tax deduction. Oil tax collection is north of 2.5 lakh crore.

8846 2018-05-27 18:53:33 Californian's don't need saving, particularly by fake Christians & Evangelicals who praise Donald Trump, a morally bankrupt pathological liar & serial adulterer.

8847 2018-05-27 18:53:32 only the royal family is rich and you are happy with it. You have oil, but you do not have independence. that's it. You're not my enemy.

8854 2018-05-27 18:52:50 he is nothing but a snake oil salesmen using the weak minded to make him a very wealthy man and now influencing the lunatic in the WH and the GOP he pays no taxes while they waste ours
8855 2018-05-27 18:52:47 Ron Baby;  In the summer Government Regulations mandate additives which cause the increase. Local Government also makes more $ then the OIL companies.  Frack away!
8856 2018-05-27 18:52:41 Besides, "tracking" ppl is not particularly American. I'm sure if gov tried there would be court challenges forgetting logistical challenges

8862 2018-05-27 18:51:38 Or you could leave the oil in Alberta, where it should be, because why spend billions to transport it thousands of miles unnecessarily? Better to create jobs in other sectors that will be more beneficial to them. Only 33% of people in Quebec supported it.

8876 2018-05-27 18:49:12 So if i wanted to put this oil in my vape I wouldn't need to decarboxylate right?

Stars come and go, just like every empire.
I stay fly, focused on staying higher.
8900 2018-05-27 18:45:43 You see and tell what suits you.  Prasing modi.  You don't talk about oil prices nor does you pm.  Just take today so many  tweets but nothing on oil prices
8901 2018-05-27 18:45:40 If they did track them, find problems, then removed them, media would further spin this to be ripping them from families. No win situation
8902 2018-05-27 18:45:39 I didn't say that. But we cant ne the bad guys and then go around condemning other people for fighting back against us. The majority of so called terrorists of today are funded by us, UK, Saudi Arabia or other allies. Or were made because we invaded on false pretenses for oil.
8903 2018-05-27 18:45:37 Maybe you should check the price of oil. While it is up 2.4% over the year it hasn't been rising dramatically.  Maybe the fed and state gives who make the most money on a gallon of gas should cut their taxes to allow it's citizens to hae a break!
8904 2018-05-27 18:45:36 Fresh eucalyptus in the shower! I get a sinus blend oil from the co-op that I use on the inside of my nostrils, it’s nice for bedtime.
8905 2018-05-27 18:45:28 Total BS. The only wars which have been fought recently (past 60 years) have been about Vested Interests, Oil and US Dollars ... nothing more, nothing less.
8906 2018-05-27 18:45:18 You can Pastor and still change YOUR OWN oil!!!! We got to stop abusing servanthood for laziness!!!
8907 2018-05-27 18:45:18 Oil > lotion
8908 2018-05-27 18:45:15 @tferriss what CBD oil from charlottes webb do you use?
8909 2018-05-27 18:45:04 Regardless of his state of mind, saying something that is not true IS A LIE whether he believes it or not

A snake oil salesman would still get run out of town on a rail even if he took his own product
8910 2018-05-27 18:44:59 2.0 was happy I changed the oil in her car. Not happy that I made her watch.

8915 2018-05-27 18:44:13 well I was gonna suggest G/G videos but not sure my heart could take it and I'm too young to die lol! anytime you use oil, maybe ice on the boobies & hiney, light spanking, sensual touching & tickling, singing and of course tushy talk you know I'll buy it and absolutely love it!

8917 2018-05-27 18:44:08 We as Americans have massive oil that you democrats don’t allow to be used to drop our cost and stifle the Middle East in their strangle hold. Your a fraud
8918 2018-05-27 18:43:57 Hey oil changes in your room and get lined up in my room
8919 2018-05-27 18:43:54 Trump doesn't own the pump. Did Obama own the pump when gas was $5 p/ gallon?  We don't buy oil from Iran.
8920 2018-05-27 18:43:44 Maybe, but it wasn’t extra-virgin-olive-oil so consume at your own risk :)
8921 2018-05-27 18:43:38 #ZedTwitter where can I find tea tree oil in Lusaka? 
TIA
8922 2018-05-27 18:43:38 Oil, retail, food, automobiles, etc. Every damn thing. The more important thing is when to boycott. Every business quarter has days they project to get a jump in profits. Some of those are obvious and some are not.
8923 2018-05-27 18:43:35 It was by accident that we discovered oil. We were looking for water.
8924 2018-05-27 18:43:33 I like her shoes.
8925 2018-05-27 18:43:28 Ever? How did the oil ( Fossil fuels decomposing) get in the arctic?
Besides warming Will cause more greening. Or "GLOBAL GREENING". It will sustain more life.
8926 2018-05-27 18:43:28 Its a society problem that began when idiots like you thought is would be a good idea to scrap religion, respect, morals, gender, responsibility and started a generation of entitled punks. Hey, at least you got the 'change' u wanted, cause things were so bad 20+ yrs ago.
8927 2018-05-27 18:43:07 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
8928 2018-05-27 18:43:06 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
8929 2018-05-27 18:43:06 We need to preserve the natural habitat of  lgbtq, women, immigrants,  decent people who dislike cynical snake oil salesmen, catholics...
8930 2018-05-27 18:43:06 To me, the people playing long games are (1) oligarchs, (2) arms and oil merchants, and (3) the Russian mafia. In some cases, they overlap.
8931 2018-05-27 18:42:57 Ondo for your information is an oil producing state.Also,is there accountability in the ND states?The answer is no.@PremiumTimesng  just ran a story on the woeful state of schools in Akwa Ibom.Don't forget Ibori used Delta state funds for Yaradua in 2007.
8932 2018-05-27 18:42:56 I'm not saying it's deliberate, Salah first clutched his hand obviously, but saying Salah had time to remove his hand while falling is just ridiculous.
8933 2018-05-27 18:42:50 @Franklin_Graham is just another snake oil salesman.
8934 2018-05-27 18:42:40 yes it's about time you started seeing the importance of the jobs and infrastructure that is already in place but is at risk because of the oil industry. Forget the new #Pipeline all the old ones need to be removed too.
8935 2018-05-27 18:42:31 it is 78 degrees in our apartment because Kate has the windows open while she brews some strange tea tree oil and honey concoction for her face and it SMELLS and I'm HOT and WHY DID I MARRY A BOG WITCH
8936 2018-05-27 18:42:28 Crow all you want about oil buddies. All politicians owe someone. I’d rather through my lot in with biz than an overreaching govt which is what the dem platform is
8937 2018-05-27 18:42:24 I just paid $85 for a fucking oil change ....
8938 2018-05-27 18:42:10 The other reason given is it replaces coal. Dubious, at best.

Same with the revised warming data that came out, was it, a year ago? "Yay, now we can keep burning oil for longer!" No, we have been given a better chance of reaching climate goals, if we keep fighting emissions.
8939 2018-05-27 18:42:08 This doesn't even count the family units which number several hundred thousand a yr. Over time your talking millions of ppl.

8943 2018-05-27 18:41:24 Lie, there is no proxy war on Iran in Yemen , is a Yemeni Saudi  war, but the destruction and killing of Yemenis under the pretext of Iran? I am sure that there is no Iran in Yemen, neither near nor far, and the truth is that there are oil wells on the border with Saudi & Yemen

8946 2018-05-27 18:41:01 Their not fighting for freedom. Their fighting for oil, and money to put in the bosses pockets. And we all know that’s the truth.

8954 2018-05-27 18:39:36 Actually tryout wrong and the oil is massive.
8955 2018-05-27 18:39:13 Yeah you’re right! Or, instead of doing that, we could just build some refineries in Alberta which would eliminate the need for such huge expensive pipe lines. Why do we need to refine our oil in Houston? Or even in New Brunswick?
8956 2018-05-27 18:39:03 We do Kettle's competition here in Texas ... Boulder Kettle Chips (vernacular here, of course!). Boulder OLIVE OIL our go to as we can get those for $5 a GIGANTIC bag!

8959 2018-05-27 18:38:37 The CEOs of oil companies probably don’t actually believe the Fox News shit. How do they make money on the war? Who do they want to win? Prob not the Nazi-confederates. They donate to red state GOPs because that’s where the oil is.
8960 2018-05-27 18:38:32 @abbyvandyke_ sent me money to get an oil change, I don’t deserve her

8962 2018-05-27 18:38:25 Many people believe that the reason President Trump pulled out of the Iran deal was to leave the lead to Russia and to further erode U.S. influence in the area.  Ready for another OPEC oil embargo?

8976 2018-05-27 18:36:12 Scottish firms could have made money from the North Sea oil but WM has sucked it up & carved it out for itself & its business partners & then had them relocate their HQ's so they hoover revenues & profits out of Scotland.
8977 2018-05-27 18:36:12 Made with avocado  oil? Fkn nasty. Never mind on sushi but in general.
8978 2018-05-27 18:36:11 Manufacturing.  Heavy influence into oil and gas but we just got our foot heavy into microprocessors.
8979 2018-05-27 18:35:49 Are you insinuating that there are not many women working in the oil and gas industry? 
Wow! The more you tweet the more you expose the fact that you really don't know what your talking about.
Shameful!

8984 2018-05-27 18:35:26 Where’s that billions your crying about coming from? Selling oil half way across the planet to Asia through BC’s coast? Where’s the math on this billion dollars claim you’re making?

8986 2018-05-27 18:35:17 Yea, because having Iran's country surrounded by military bases as we burn the middle east down for oil and opium should have them accepting us with open arms right?

8991 2018-05-27 18:34:32 Also! Wooden handles hang onto more bacteria and will get rough and splinter unless you oil them so non wooden handles are actually far better for many reasons.

8995 2018-05-27 18:34:21 That scenario suggested that it may be impossible to move beyond Bronze Age tech without easy access to dense, liquid, stable energy like oil. In other words, we have our one and only shot to get this right—and we are blowing it.

8999 2018-05-27 18:34:05 In 2003, I became part of SEAL Team 3, where we supported Operation Iraqi Freedom.

9034 2018-05-27 18:29:23 It's like an exotic sports car except it marks it's territory with .50 cal brass and not engine oil.Too ostentatious, over priced, very expensive to run, hard to find ammo for it & a BLAST to shoot. 

In other words, it's perfect and you should own one.
9035 2018-05-27 18:29:20 This is something people don't get when I take a slug of MCT oil.  They think, "I just saw him drink liquid fat as a snack."  Well, yeah, but I am also now done snacking while they finish that bag of chips over the next hour.
9036 2018-05-27 18:29:13 Cont: Since Mikes 6/12/17 video the scenario has gotten 5X better w KAZ, CCJ, DOE and others cuts, 232, IPO getting closer, oil taking off, geo-politically craziness, and now simply "time." It is a yr later and the Utilities have to come to the realization they are a herd in need

Last I check oil prices were down before Iran deal was even looked at
9041 2018-05-27 18:28:38 I remembered I had peppermint oil and rubbed some on my temples, took ibuprofen, and had a hot pack on my shoulders. All of that worked some freaking wonders.
9042 2018-05-27 18:28:37 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
9043 2018-05-27 18:28:31 @sunnygirl20 my room smells like wild orange. I used what’s left of my #Doterra oil in my diffuser. Now I need a new one.  #LoveIt

9046 2018-05-27 18:28:03 That’s what I do when I go to my parents house FOH toilet paper, paper towels, olive oil, apple cider vinegar 
9047 2018-05-27 18:27:59 Trump* is a con man & a grifter. The fact that so many bought his schtick, & that so many are still guzzling his snake oil, says more about my fellow citizens & the state of our democracy than it does about him.
9048 2018-05-27 18:27:31 Yes but that's not the government is the oil industry private sector
9049 2018-05-27 18:27:30 Anyone who believes this is a complete moron. Iran’s oil production is small compared to global supply.  Your socialist buddies in Venezuela destroying they country and their oil Industry has a MUCH bigger impact. Why would we ever take economic advice from a socialist like you?

9052 2018-05-27 18:27:06 Which one were you using the olive oil one ?? Cause there's a pink eco styler gel that's a little more natural but it still has the TEA. Ik I should stop using it, but it works so well on 4c hair. I'm kind of torn on what to time!
9053 2018-05-27 18:26:55 when did you say that? 1977 carter was in office, Reagan kept us with old oil processes, and tree hugger suggests a distain... sorry to have read your post with all the missing intent, Dale
9054 2018-05-27 18:26:43 We need a better term for what vets do with good intent and/or out of economic necessity when they occupy people's lands for oil and whatnot than "defend our freedom" which is 100% bogus and inaccurate.
9055 2018-05-27 18:26:31 Yep. When I spent my month there, it was like I was in a war zone. Because I was.
9056 2018-05-27 18:26:24 It's really easy just buy fresh chicken breast pieces then gently fry, I use rapeseed oil to fry, then I added organic honey and sesame seeds and cooked all together it's very tasty. I like honey chicken from the Chinese but they put batter on the chicken so it's unhealthy

9065 2018-05-27 18:24:55 I don't care much for untappd but our Mild is rated higher than Neck Oil! In my experience, most untappd users are "craft beer" fans. The problem with mild is keeping it. Most pubs (including us) can't sell a whole firkin in 3 days. We use pins but they're not commonly available.

9090 2018-05-27 18:21:51 My problem with your statement is the word “mostly”. What about the others?  As I’ve already said, the other option to being pissed about this and trying to find them is to throw our hands up and pretend they never existed.

9099 2018-05-27 18:21:07 Um. The rise in oil was due to Saudi Arabia standing by its decision to cut production. It needed to prop up oil prices before it issued the IPO on its state run oil company. How do I know? I bet on Permian basin stocks and doubled my money in 3 months.

9117 2018-05-27 18:19:47 Because of the irrational decision...and increasing debt uptake...

Debt service is projected to hit the magical N3tn by 2020...

Meaning all revenue including Oil and Non-Oil won't be able to cover that obligation

No sensible person will borrow such government money
9118 2018-05-27 18:19:37 And they are using that oil multiple times lol
9119 2018-05-27 18:19:32 oh, hello
9120 2018-05-27 18:19:20 Regardless, the Iran deal going south is a large contributor to rising global oil prices I think. Instability in Iran and Venezuela.
9121 2018-05-27 18:19:09 Hmm so DJ Trump forced oil producing countries who are deep in debt to raise their prices and cut their production by a third?  Who knew an American Près could do that.  Oh wait He didn’t and He couldn’t. Mr Wyden I don’t know which you know less about. Economics or power!

The sooner we all embrace a move away from oil, the easier the transition will be for Alberta, specifically.
9135 2018-05-27 18:16:38 You have no idea what you’re talking about, do you? That is frightening since you are US senator.  Why don’t you stop playing politics and learn a little bit about the oil market.

9172 2018-05-27 18:12:40 This is awful. 27% what the hell? Why are we responsible for oil spill caused by others?
Fast forward & imagine if we did not #StopKM
9173 2018-05-27 18:12:24 Trump reducing regs & opening up more drilling will let market forces kick in - price of oil dropped >5% on Thursday & Friday!!
9174 2018-05-27 18:12:17 Northeast winters forced consumers to pay billions over national average in energy costs, businesses threatening to leave due to high energy bills, pipelines protested BUT energy is used to power ships to bring in LNG/oil to use fuel to truck/rail in fuel-Obama 8 yrs, Trump <1.5
9175 2018-05-27 18:12:12 Iran is practically swimming in oil and natural gas and yet we are supposed to believe in the "exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program".  Give me an effing break. People like Zarif must giggle when they write this crap.
9176 2018-05-27 18:12:07 Tempted and bought 2 essence oil with a same aroma, 1 for office & 1 for myself. Lately my mind having a hard time to tell where I’m at now.

9178 2018-05-27 18:11:50 Further loss of confidence in the naira. And if Govt doesn’t change its ways, when there’s an oil price speculation will increase a lot
9179 2018-05-27 18:11:48 Oh give me a break. He's a liar and he's delusional. There's a reason used car salesmen, traveling revivals, and snake oil salesmen are viewed with annoyance and disdain. They're all LIARS. If he believes his lies, he's crazy too. You don't sugar coat it.
9180 2018-05-27 18:11:47 During the time of Jimmy Carter America began ot follow the star of human rights. Somewhere between Carter and the first Gulf War America left that path pursued oil interests instead.  We need to return to the Carter paradigm.
9181 2018-05-27 18:11:34 Oh yes, definitely prefer homemade but if it’s a choice between coconut oil or McDs, it’s fast food all the way 
9182 2018-05-27 18:11:28 But oil companies having to make what 50 different blends of fuels aren't a factor in prices going up? Here's an idea let's get rid of Summer Blends and watch prices drop

9185 2018-05-27 18:10:56 Would someone, ANYONE, please share the “How to fail gracefully for idiots” handbook with @HillaryClinton?

9188 2018-05-27 18:10:44 Weren't they a petrostate that could afford to fund their social programs, then oil tanked, and they went broke?
9189 2018-05-27 18:10:43 Black limba looks great as a table top with a Danish oil finish. For pen turning, it’s hard to beat the figuring of cocobolo.
9190 2018-05-27 18:10:35 Yes, but the fall in oil prices recently is the result of booming N. American production, Saudi Arabia’s hesitance to cut output, & a drop in Asian demand. That wasn't the case in 2011-14. This spike in prices is due to speculation in Trump's policies which since have borne fruit
9191 2018-05-27 18:10:22 .@ParkBoard chair @betterparks says if there is a spill it will be diluted bitumen, not bunker oil (as in Marathassa spill), will be much harder to clean.
9192 2018-05-27 18:10:20 美少年は今日も可愛いなー！
9193 2018-05-27 18:10:12 How much of that fuel price is tax? Price of a barrel of oil is half what it was about 10 years ago.

9195 2018-05-27 18:10:09 Increases lack of confidence in the local currency. And if the govt doesn’t change it’s behaviour it will lead to a lot of speculation when oil prices crash and people are expecting a devaluation

9199 2018-05-27 18:09:45 Lmaooo
9200 2018-05-27 18:09:37 Stupid is what comes out of @RonWyden mouth. Every year at this time, gas prices spike for one reason and that's because oil companies can get away with it. There is absolutely no shortage of oil, but Wyden like all Liberals choose to spew hate towards our President.

9207 2018-05-27 18:08:53 people of America don't listen to all the noise Trump making it's just to throw people off everything like his EPA man steeling everything. Donald Trump Putin lying puppet. he lied killed the Iran deal, now Russia can come in and sell their oil n our oil go up. a win for Russia.

9212 2018-05-27 18:07:44 I think it's fine. The main similarities are due to how he keeps his hair and beard, which are choices he makes.  If it was 100% due to his face it might be a little mean.  Either way a joke's a joke- I look like Olive Oil from Popeye and she's not particularly attractive.
9213 2018-05-27 18:07:31 I look forward to the day when Rebecca and all her friends act like they never supported trump because they'll learn that they were the ones fooled by the snake oil salesman.
9214 2018-05-27 18:07:29 Totally agree, it was just echoing Big Oil & Detroit's positions and was deliberately insulting and provocative. It was supposed to hurt. I've submitted my letter to the editor though, so I guess that was the point.
9215 2018-05-27 18:07:26 They wanted $80 oil but it happened too fast. They had to talk it down twice when the front-month went over $80 intraday
9216 2018-05-27 18:07:19 The way official asked, what does an engineer do Middle East pissed him off. He said, I drill oil so you can drive home. Stamped.
9217 2018-05-27 18:07:15 The deal with Iran has almost nothing to do the gas prices.  The cost of oil has gone up because of the strong economy and strong demand.  It’s not brain surgery.  This guy is just looking for something to bash Trump about. Keep looking.
9218 2018-05-27 18:07:15 .@MayorGregor says city supposed to be paid out through oil spill pollution fund, says federal regulators supposed to pursue polluters after that. Says internationally flagged vessels difficult to track & recover costs from.
9219 2018-05-27 18:07:07 The restaurant in front of our store fucking stinks like old oil . I don’t even want to breathe through my fucking nose because it’s really making my stomach hurt..
9220 2018-05-27 18:06:59 It's time to become an oil sheik
9221 2018-05-27 18:06:46 We we will need oil for a while longer, but we don't need filthy tar sands dilbit.
9222 2018-05-27 18:06:44 In 2012 per barrel oil was 118$ ,and today its 87$..still petrol on its apex position till date.... Well criticising govt isnt good bt what the oppositions are doing @RahulGandhi @INCIndia ...it seems Mr Gandhi politics is nt ur cup of tea
9223 2018-05-27 18:06:38 Fruit oil somehow sounds better - though also fairly useless.
9224 2018-05-27 18:06:37 I now know how to change the oil and oil filter on my car, AND how to change a tire 
9225 2018-05-27 18:06:34 Chocolate cake? Nope! A superbly nourishing soap for the skin containing lots of yummy oils including rosehip oil and Australian clay and the second image is a creative soap project suggested by a lovely friend Hai Pa! Hmmm a creative Sunday? Yep and now it s Painting time 
9226 2018-05-27 18:06:29 I got that Jason and the argon oil shampoo bar, the “big” solid conditioner which have my hair feeling better than ever. And I calm my skin with the fomo jelly mask. #needmorelush
9227 2018-05-27 18:06:26 Enjoy it while you can...POTUS we'll take care of this problem. Big drop in oil prices on Friday and that will continue. Amazing how people like you are so happy when bad things happen to America.

9230 2018-05-27 18:06:18 So far, your trade “deals” haven’t produced anything positive.  Levying tariffs raises prices in U.S.  How does that help Americans?  Oil prices way up, unaffordable healthcare deteriorating, inflation on the horizon.
9231 2018-05-27 18:06:15 .@MayorGregor says city has been offered 27% of costs from oil spill fund.
9232 2018-05-27 18:06:10 Oil change and tires 
9233 2018-05-27 18:05:58 Hearing people say certain rappers don’t write their own rhymes is silly. I don’t change my own oil but I own the car. 
9234 2018-05-27 18:05:41 Hooray, Disco has new oil now. I think it's happier.
9235 2018-05-27 18:05:31 Instead of encouraging sustainable energy and environmentally friendly transportation we’re gonna stick with old stuff like oil and coal.

9236 2018-05-27 18:05:27 short oil
9237 2018-05-27 18:05:25 The @RachelNotley NDP had almost no oil/gas industry experience in 2015. So, they relied upon extensive consultations w/a wide range of stakeholders, expert testimony, science, verifiable evidence, scholarship, etc. Over 3 yrs that produced a robust set of energy policies.
9238 2018-05-27 18:05:13 And why did he want to wreck the Iran deal? To lower the supply of crude and raise oil prices. How much is big oil and gas paying him for that?
9239 2018-05-27 18:05:05 Iran supplied no oil to us.
We outproduce them.  Prices are due to simple supply and demand....which is normal in a market economy.

9247 2018-05-27 18:04:03 It’s NOT oil. The #TMX will carry bitumen, which has to be diluted with VERY toxic, flammable chemicals to make it flow. In rail cars, no diluting, it’s heated to flow into railcar, then hardens to a non-flammable goop that goes nowhere if the car derails. MUCH safer by rail.
9248 2018-05-27 18:04:01 Pumpkin seed oil. Everyone has it 
9249 2018-05-27 18:03:46 Exactly. It’s like water & oil. We need to come together & stop fighting. We need to understand each individual more & get the meanings of things more in line. Fighting & dividing will only make things worst. That’s why it’s getting worst & not better
9250 2018-05-27 18:03:30 The oil is floating on top of the water because it's less dense then water, nothing is made wet in that situation...
9251 2018-05-27 18:03:22 It’s an oil from the actual rose plant & works very well for hydrating your skin! It has a lot of benefits but for myself it does really well at correcting spots or scars
9252 2018-05-27 18:03:13 Oh, well, wow. The promoted post under this one is trying to convince me to put mayo on maki. No, it having avocado pit oil in it will not make it count as avocado. 

Why, white people? Why?

9273 2018-05-27 18:01:31 Obama used the IRS to audit conservatives 

Obama used the FTC to shut down gun manufactures via “operation chokepoint” 

Obama used the EPA to shut down thousands of oil and gas producers

9294 2018-05-27 17:59:37 Your mouth is way too dirty for a dumb bird! I'm going to fry you in oil! When your real owner comes to get you I'm going to kill them!
9295 2018-05-27 17:59:31 @ColossalChig The fact is though oil is not going anywhere,  he has just signed a new contract so his transfer would  be at least 50 million  plus his wages at 29 ,no one  is going to pay that unless it's PSG

9299 2018-05-27 17:58:47 I don't understand how one can sincerely think we can keep burning oil that way...

Well, having the said oil is probably a motivation :)

Carbon capture will be necessary. Its risk is that it u lets us think that thank to them, we can keep business as usual. We can't.

9312 2018-05-27 17:57:05 You have already done the needful. Dont trouble yourself further. Stay patient and try to peel it off gently using an oil or petroleum jelly. It will loosen with time and become easier to peel off.

9315 2018-05-27 17:56:28 He should have stood in front of a gas line in California. It’s a dollar higher here. Because of excessive democratic taxes. Do these people not understand that oil prices are run by supply and not politics? No financial paper reports high gas prices because of trumps policies.
9316 2018-05-27 17:56:25 Love it when you get off the bus to see oil spilling out and smoke coming from the back 
9317 2018-05-27 17:56:21 Excuse me.  I just spilled a gallon on Olive Oil.
9318 2018-05-27 17:56:14 Yes, must be negative to reach preindustrial ppm numbers. Our oil minister keeps saying "all serious scenarios allow oil and gas for several more decades". What he doesn't say is those scenarios require substantial capture (CCS) and that tech doesn't exist yet, if it ever will.

9351 2018-05-27 17:51:53 I would recommend that you deep condition your hair every week and that you add moisture to your hair everyday and then after adding the moisture you seal your hair with a thick oil.

9358 2018-05-27 17:50:53 Think about what your saying as you drive your car around with the AC on and turn on your funace and lights. Tell the poor people in Lac Megantic that oil has to be rolling though there. And be sure to thank the US for screwing us and taking our natural resources.
9359 2018-05-27 17:50:52 Because everybody always talks about Orwell and 1984. Seriously Dune was really ahead of its time as far as imperialism, religious fundamentalism, oil in a desert world, and so many other themes.

9404 2018-05-27 17:44:39 I am well aware of how pervasive oil is in our everyday life.  We should be making choices to cut back our consumption. Do I really need a new coat and boots this year? Can I wait another year?  If enough people take small measures, the accumulated actions make a difference

How soon Canada forgets an economic powerhouse like Oil rich Alberta ALL OF CANADA does well.
No more.
Now you can see how Canada is ripping at the seams with no economy.  No oil/gas. No jobs. Just more hoax taxes & alinsky playbook destruction.

9436 2018-05-27 17:40:01 I was just going to say oil of clove eases tooth pain until you can get to a dentist. Hubby broke a molar over night so he’s counting down until dentist opens tmrw.
9437 2018-05-27 17:40:00 I only been using that wild growth oil for like 3 weeks & mad people been tellin me my hair is growin
9438 2018-05-27 17:39:46 after reading this paper, i will forever be in guilt of consuming palm oil

9440 2018-05-27 17:38:30 And no oil painting either.
9441 2018-05-27 17:38:24 Real issue has been that low rates didn’t flow into real economy outside of autos, oil markets via (high yield) and private equity (via leveraged loans and ultimately CLO’s). Capex didn’t budge. Most has gone to existing home sales and equities.
9442 2018-05-27 17:38:04 Plus, that’s not even the most important part. It didn’t replace “gas” it replaced Kerosine....JD was forced to find another use for oil...gasoline a once forgotten runoff from kerosine Production and boom, industrial revolution.

9448 2018-05-27 17:36:49 Looks like we will also have to write a law limiting gasoline prices or else big super wealthy oil companies will be charging $10 a gallon by 2025.  America is a big country that is being troubled by high republican led gas prices.
9449 2018-05-27 17:36:44 Home style coconut oil treatment is a must since bleaching my hair. Cannot recommend enough.

9452 2018-05-27 17:36:17 “Freedom” means being chained to an oil company and shitting where you live. “Overregulation” means being dependent on a public utility and doing a good turn for someone/something other than yourself.
9453 2018-05-27 17:36:05 The government set oil prices low which had an effect after the recession in 2008, top that with lack of policies on the private sector and an overeliance on oil. The main problem here was the overreliance on oil, this is the same problem most mideast countries face
9454 2018-05-27 17:35:48 Good. Now BC will get even less oil.
9455 2018-05-27 17:35:36 keep digging you may find oil too.

9459 2018-05-27 17:35:14 Haha true! I'll post it maybe tomorrow but I have a chart showing non-oil revenues as part of GDP Iran v KSA. Iran has done a lot more to diversify its economy away from oil. Still will hurt tho, for sure
9460 2018-05-27 17:34:45 Haha that's nature's way of saving you. Oil itself isn't bad but the way we use it is horrendous!

9462 2018-05-27 17:34:33 Poland is in favor of a nuclear agreement and continues to buy oil from Iran, I do not know where this information comes from?
9463 2018-05-27 17:34:31 It takes about 90 days for any decision to show at the pump. Oil used to make fuel today was bought months ago. Has nothing to do with Iranian deal. Has more to do with tax cuts and economists knowing more would be traveling by car this summer.
9464 2018-05-27 17:34:22 Not a book, but: I find that my anxiety usually responds to long-chain omega-3 supplementation (i.e., fish oil). Pregnancy and lactation deplete maternal stores, because gestating/nursing babies need them to build healthy brains.

9469 2018-05-27 17:33:48 The last Israeli Salad I ate had oil, vinegar, salt, pepper, and some finely chopped red onions added. It has an added appeal to religious Jews since none of the veggies need bug-checking. Hard to imagine really nailing down who invented it.
9470 2018-05-27 17:33:44 lmao yea I don’t bread my chicken, but you can put a little oil in there to combat the dryness. I know that kinda defeats the purpose but I guess it’s still less oil than what you’d usually use
9471 2018-05-27 17:32:52 Coconut oil solves everything

In 2016, petrol 70 rupees and diesel 60 rupees, crude oil was 30$ a barrel. Speak up sir. Or are you also a bhakt?

9498 2018-05-27 17:28:26 Because Marine Le Pen wasn’t talking to putin in Russia? She did relatively well in France.
Putin has lots of oil and gas. There’s business and there’s limits. Macron is not stupid.
9499 2018-05-27 17:28:25 Let's add some oil to that mess.

9501 2018-05-27 17:28:05 The use of palm oil is selfish, unnecessary. Educate yourself, stop buying ALL products that contain it. #banpalmoil #bannutella #banpepsi #banunillever #stopdeforestation #saveorangutans Why #nutella

Big banks win, oil companies get to drill and devastate more public lands, Native Americans get the #Boot and What are we getting?
9503 2018-05-27 17:27:19 Yeah, medicinal cannabis oil totally gives him an unfair advantage. Completely okay for college players to go out drinking after a game though
9504 2018-05-27 17:27:10 , and barrels of oil are cheaper. Gas prices are one of the biggest jigs.
9505 2018-05-27 17:27:08 What about sesame oil?
9506 2018-05-27 17:27:08 No oil
9507 2018-05-27 17:27:07 Why is the petrol price so high, despite the global crude oil price fall? (From being on 100$/barrel-125$/barrel (Averaging Rs.50/Ltr) to as low as 30$/barrel-80$/barrel (Averaging Rs.25/Ltr) 2/n
9508 2018-05-27 17:27:00 Then again Iraq isn’t the only place where we get our oil and not even the biggest, The top oil producer list changes quite a bit but it seems that Saudi Arabia and Russia are the biggest consistent producers

9530 2018-05-27 17:24:29 Are you lying willfully, or are you just completely ignorant that we don't buy oil from Iran?  It's one or the other. Sit down.

9559 2018-05-27 17:20:26 I dont specialize in economics but: During Chavez's time, Venezuela was doing pretty well, until Chavez nationalized the major companies in 2006 which in turn increased corruption, deterred investors, and inflation. Mix that up with lowering oil prices and you get Venezuela today

9570 2018-05-27 17:18:03 Also no, “us libs” never argued that Iraq was about gas prices. It was about controlling oil i.e. about the rich getting richer & only tangentially about prices at the pump. “Us libs” think we should be moving away from fossil fuels entirely. As any right-thinking person should.

9577 2018-05-27 17:17:30 Ah that fateful oil slick?
9578 2018-05-27 17:17:24 @JimmyDoreShow has a great story with Carla Ortiz on Syria, and the conflicts involved there. Also look into Genie Oil’s “permit” for rights to drill in golan heights
9579 2018-05-27 17:17:19 i've had half a kilo asparagus for dinner that i just covered in some olive oil and salt and pepper, wrapped it in tin foil and threw it in the oven for a while... that was SO LITTLE EFFORT!!
9580 2018-05-27 17:17:16 I'd rather use lard, coconut oil is pure saturated fat (tastes great but my arteries will hate me)

9585 2018-05-27 17:16:44 Korea is still like this. As we push the rotational Brigades into Eastern Europe I predict Poland will be like Germany was in the 80s.

9587 2018-05-27 17:16:40 Stan Lee’s twitter account always reminds me of that episode of Frasier where Bebe Glazer tries to marry that oil tycoon and he dies on the way down the aisle, and Frasier recounts how Bebe was literally puppeteering his corpse down to the altar.
9588 2018-05-27 17:16:34 Ohhh. Never seen that. Kinda strange. What if you have an oil leak... yuck.

9598 2018-05-27 17:15:34 Why? Because it isn't in their hearts to protect and promote the life of the oil and gas industry.

9603 2018-05-27 17:15:28 Koi karja nahi hai, oil companies ne oil liya, paisa nahi de paye because of Americans. Oil ko customers ko sell kiya. Paisa oil companies ke Paas tha. America Iran relationship normal hone ke Baad oil companies never vo paisa Iran ko de diya.

9614 2018-05-27 17:14:38 @akshaykumar You criticized the UPA (Congress) government in 2012 for rise in fuel prices. In 2012 - petrol cost 70 rupees and diesel cost 40 rupees, crude oil per barrel was 120$. In 2016 - petrol 70 rupees and diesel 60 rupees, crude oil cost 30$ a barrel. Why no criticism now?
9615 2018-05-27 17:14:31 ARE YOU KIDDING ME???  My 11- and 10-year-olds have been making them for themselves for at least 3 years. They’re quite easy and SOOOOOOO good. Bread, butter (or flavored olive oil) and cheese.

It was a colossal waste!

9630 2018-05-27 17:12:27 But it’s ok to have the oil supplied by the Saudis, Venezuela, etc. Thanks for clearing that up for us.

9634 2018-05-27 17:12:06 You can’t let your current condition dictate the oil that is on your life.
9635 2018-05-27 17:12:04 So I walk into my gym locker room, and a group of dudes putting baby oil on their arms... first off, wtf you needa arm pump for, shit ain’t going down tonight.. second off each of y’all are about 110lbs soaking wet.. third off my arms are the size of ya’lls legs, gtf outta here
9636 2018-05-27 17:11:52 Trolls have no substance to back them up their lies. You are a perfect example of that.
9637 2018-05-27 17:11:50 My mom used to fry canned biscuits in vegetable oil and tell us they were donuts.  My mom is a liar.
9638 2018-05-27 17:11:43 Authentic black soap for cleanser. Thayer’s alcohol-free toner. An oil serum (I recommend @BahiCosmetics) and a good moisturizer depending on your skin type. A mask once or twice a week. Exfoliate twice a week also.
9639 2018-05-27 17:11:39 oil see about that
9640 2018-05-27 17:11:31 No doctor uses oil in the hospital!!! @praiseologist #ltps2018 #closeout #sundaymorningservice
9641 2018-05-27 17:11:21 Another astonishing economic fact from WW2 I just learned from Adam Tooze's "Wages of destruction": in January 1941, German oil inventories were so low that the British didn't believe their (almost perfectly accurate) intelligence reports & multiplied the estimates by 2.
9642 2018-05-27 17:11:08 That seemed like the best. Or coconut oil ?
9643 2018-05-27 17:11:03 Fuck, I wish I could write more on twitter but let me rephrase: I have talked to many Venezuelans, most of whom refugees. They said Chavez was the one who started the issues the day he relied on oil for the economy.
9644 2018-05-27 17:10:46 And the awkward ride back with the olive oil lady 
9645 2018-05-27 17:10:42 I grew up GenX nouveau-riche oil industry Houston. I think that's the key difference. I was the only one I knew at school who had to obey their parents & do chores without an allowance, & skilled manipulation of one's parents considered mandatory. Glad yours was different!

9648 2018-05-27 17:10:22 What about crude oil?

9652 2018-05-27 17:10:05 the problem seems to be having a currency that meets scotland's economic needs that isn't susceptible to outside manipulation or volatile - either too high (say as oil price jumps up) or too low (as ill wishers try to force up scottish interest rates).  Saor Alba.
9653 2018-05-27 17:10:03 It is all about oil mate.

9655 2018-05-27 17:09:46 Yes.  Get a principled conservative in the mix and not some nut job snake oil salesmen.  I would vote for Flake in a second
9656 2018-05-27 17:09:46 US producing near-15m barrels/day. Oil prices fall taking into consideration post summer demand. WTI July 2018 futures below 68 USD/b. What supply/demand imbalance?
9657 2018-05-27 17:09:35 also a lil expensive but like, lush does some nice talc powder stuff w cocoa butter in em and that helps massively (my skin does not agree w coconut oil)
9658 2018-05-27 17:09:32 Did the Brazilian gov’t explain the REASON for the “lockout” and the ABUSIVE taxes on oil?
9659 2018-05-27 17:09:02 Isn’t that like saying if Alberta cares about selling oil and oil jobs then why are they refusing to sell it to BC? #carrotandstick
9660 2018-05-27 17:08:55 I'm not saying that all supporters of anything are all of one political persuasion, just that in particular the political perspectives often on show at NASCAR may not best be mixed with that of Micheal A, (someone staunchly anti-trumpytarded) oil and water...
9661 2018-05-27 17:08:50 Is it difficult not to laugh uncontrollably when an MSP comes out with something hilarious, like Iain Gray's "where's the oil fund money coming from" moment? @TriciaMarwick I know Christine Grahame, so I know that she can be deadpan when required. (And you do NOT mess wi her.)
9662 2018-05-27 17:08:40 And for a sprain oil of worms and saltpetre - presumably if being sick didn't take your mind of the pain the worry that there might be a small explosion in the vicinity of your foot might..
9663 2018-05-27 17:08:40 Impressive given the number of years.  I know some who forget over one wild week of spring break. Did you say oil rig in your head?

9669 2018-05-27 17:08:00 I can actually remember operating a telex machine. They were hard going, trust me. You had to start out pressing a thing to get an answerback, then type out the message on a terrible keyboard and wait for an answerback.  They were much favoured for early Oil Rig communication. 
9670 2018-05-27 17:07:58 I thought that Wickens was the one that crashed out not Davison! For me their liveries look so similar
9671 2018-05-27 17:07:51 Depends on who is in govt. How does a Texas oil company influence Canadian laws?
We must do away with foreign/domestic industrie's abilities to influence law making mechanisms in Canada.
9672 2018-05-27 17:07:47 This is why Trump supporters try to justify their votes. You epitomize the loony left. Whatever you thought of Vietnam and Iraq, Afghanistan wasn’t about oil, nor are our actions in Syria. None of this is an excuse to demean military service or morally criticize service members.
9673 2018-05-27 17:07:46 Hello friend! Apart from -all the- Argan oil on towel dry hair, try olive oil  (keep it overnight) and/or washing your hair with chamomile tea.
9674 2018-05-27 17:07:07 I could cook rocks in coconut oil and it would tase good.

9676 2018-05-27 17:07:01 When you wash it less often it’ll adjust & not produce as much oil but it’ll take some not so good hair days to get there. Bc every time you wash it you strip it of natural oils so your hair follicles overproduce more oil to make up for it.. also dry shampoo 
9677 2018-05-27 17:06:51 Please skip the castor oil, it's dangerous. Baby will come when baby is ready :) I went 40+1 and 40+4. The 40+1 was 6lbs15oz (measurements in utero can be sooooo off), 40+4 was 9lbs. The bigger one was so much easier though! No labor is the same. You'll be fine, you're strong!

9693 2018-05-27 17:04:54 To make it : We boil the pasta for 8 minutes , then pour the oil on the bottom of a pot, then we add sliced potatoes at the bottom then pasta then Bolognese then pasta, and let it be on the hearth for 30 minutes. The method is borrowed from iranian style rice cooking.

with some chalk it does work (I thought it was all)

in that situation, it may have had to be oil rather than water for it to mix

9830 2018-05-27 16:48:36 most important factor is the capacity of the different product systems in a refinery not the overall refinery capacity.

9845 2018-05-27 16:47:07 FOR ALL MY BIG THIGHED PALS THIS SUMMER: I fucking see you in these thigh chafing streets, your pain is my pain, coconut oil will stop blistering and getting soar, wear whatever feels comfortable and serve some LEGS GAWD 
9846 2018-05-27 16:47:03 For those who aren’t aware: coconut oil is a sun tanning MIRACLE rub it all over your skin, lay in the sun while smelling like a QUEEN, get out, shower, and then FEEL HOW SOFT AND SEE HOW GOLDEN YOUR SKIN IS WHEN UR DONE ur welcome 
9847 2018-05-27 16:46:56 Since the beginning of #MAGA

China cuts American ag imports

Japan/China sign a trade deal  making them a larger client than the US, so does Saudi Arabia

N and S Korea negotiated a peace in China w/o the US (we still guard their border)

EU cut US oil imports for Chinese oil

9852 2018-05-27 16:46:17 @SenJohnMcCain; Kuwait was the # 1 oil producer, Iraq was the # 4 oil producer. Pitting one against the other solved the oil glut problem. The US had complete control of the Kuwaiti air space prior to the threats to burn their oil wells, yet it still happened. How? Pre mined...
9853 2018-05-27 16:46:14 Did a chicken on my bbq roaster with white wine and thyme and rubbed with rape oil, but it went too quick for me to get a pic!
9854 2018-05-27 16:45:55 Would you settle for an orange jumpsuit and baby oil? Because it's gonna happen.
9855 2018-05-27 16:45:52 @WhiteHouse and @GOP pass a huge corporate tax cut with a tiny impact on take home pay — all that benefit is now going to oil corporations because gas is so expensive — burn in hell @POTUS

9857 2018-05-27 16:45:46 If Scotlands economy is in bad shape, thats Westminster fault, they have had all economic levers for 300yrs, since 70s Scotland has been deindustrialised with little to replace it, creating a dependancy on fiscal transfer while spending the oil money creating London financial

9865 2018-05-27 16:43:29 I have 2 degrees and I am currently unemployed. Was laid off from the oil and gas industry in 2015 when it crashed. When I think back to where I am in my career today (HR Manager) I realize I could’ve saved nearly 85K+ and just worked hard.
9866 2018-05-27 16:43:21 Thought you did great at the Munk debate, glad you called out Dyson at the end for being a huckster & snake oil salesman. they need to pick their participants betters next time

9869 2018-05-27 16:42:50 They turn on each other like rabid dogs.  The closer we get to 2020, they will only get worse.  Maggie Haggerman got eviscerated by the resistance yesterday.

9873 2018-05-27 16:41:40 LOL Cohen is a mobster. 17 of his phones were taken plus all his files. Trump is fucked. Shit is more heated than Stormy in a tub full of oil.
9874 2018-05-27 16:41:39 Europe has absolute power to implode Russia without firing a missile by ending all sales of Russian oil / gas to Europe which is ~10% of Russian national GDP.
9875 2018-05-27 16:41:32 Coconut oil, how is that made?
When you squeeze coconut, you get milky fluid, not oil.
9876 2018-05-27 16:41:31 Just spit balling, going to say that it’s because they’re covered in hair and that’s why you have to constantly brush dogs because if the oil builds up then they smell. Plus they sweat through their noses and paws (areas not covered in hair).

9878 2018-05-27 16:40:59 @POTUS Please do something about the soaring gas prices!!! release the oil that is in reserve until they bring these prices down, but do something
9879 2018-05-27 16:40:58 How are you too picky for balsamic vinegar. Listen. A big piece of mozzarella cheese needs balsamic. Bread and oil? Balsamic. Salad? Balsamic. It’s the most important flavor in my life. It’s like a) balsamic b) spicy c) sweet r my three loves
9880 2018-05-27 16:40:58 I've just spent 15 horrifying minutes cutting chicken breasts into small pieces for a stir fry. Threw it into the pan with what I assumed was Don Fucking Carlos. It's COD LIVER OIL
9881 2018-05-27 16:40:58 I was supposed to been get my oil changed 
9882 2018-05-27 16:40:56 I’ve been tracking this. Same pattern as ‘07-‘08. Home price bubble, stock market inflated not supported on fundamentals & oil/gas prices spike for no good reason except for speculation. Then bubble bursts into economic recession or worse. Trump’s in WH. Could be his grand plan?
9883 2018-05-27 16:40:53 I too suspected a Koch or big oil agent. A fake tesla owner, perhaps connected with the  Russians.  You can always tell because they bring up problems supposedly experienced and don’t break easily under the brutal interrogation/ humiliation tactics. Obviously trained.
9884 2018-05-27 16:40:46 ECO style with olive oil! better & smells better than the normal one and it doesn’t make your hair hard
9885 2018-05-27 16:40:32 I support bjp ,but fuel prices are hiked everyday even when crude oil price dropped. thier is obviously something wrong. this is totally ridiculous.
9886 2018-05-27 16:40:14 No it won't. Just more #DramaNews! Why is it 10yrs ago when oil was around 70$ a barrel gas was around 2.20/ Gal now it's around 2.75/Gal? @realDonaldTrump #PURGE #MAGA #BuildTheWall #SundayMorning
9887 2018-05-27 16:40:11 Yeah but come on, it's not like that person's BFF is the president of an autocratic sham-democracy that relies on oil revenue as it's main source of income.

9891 2018-05-27 16:40:03 What is the olive oil even meant to do?! Because that’s what they told me to use but felt like it was doing nothing so I bought otex which has definitely been better but still suffering. Get spontaneous bursts of hearing for 10-15 secs then goes back to blocked

9898 2018-05-27 16:39:28 It might end up super dense - what I would do is add the purée first, then see what consistency your batter is and add the recommended box ingredients. If water/oil are present, add them last, and a little at a time until you get the pourable but not full on liquid batter.
9899 2018-05-27 16:39:19 What year did the first oil company ever begin drilling? Time to move on. Change is good for the world. Keep it in the ground.  Grow weed for fuel Iran.
9900 2018-05-27 16:39:19 I need tea tree oil
9901 2018-05-27 16:39:18 @SenJohnMcCain: Iraq invaded Kuwait after being influenced by the persuasive H W Bush/ Cheney/ Saudi effort to address the global oil glut, which was crushing oil profits. The Iraq war was partly intended to remove witnesses & evidence of that prior event. Were you privy or not?
9902 2018-05-27 16:39:11 Yeeeeah, its a truckers strike because of the oil diesel price increase.
9903 2018-05-27 16:39:10 Technology has caught up to oil and gas business as long as we have internet connection we can work anywhere. Live like a king down there on American wages.

9917 2018-05-27 16:37:22 Except we aren’t building a new Parklands refinery or any new refinery... you’re planning on shipping this oil out by oil tanker to sea, through Metro Vancouver with your highly flammable and toxic sludge!
9918 2018-05-27 16:37:18 i was just trying to make fries & then the smoke detector went off, then I turned the oil off & took it off the burner, then the smoke detector went off again, and i’m only a little bit bitter >:(
9919 2018-05-27 16:36:43 It’s humorous Alberta Oil is the main method of retaliation should Trump impost tariffs on Ontario Cars. Parts & Ontario Quebec Dairy & Poultry as well as BC Lumber. 
The irony is that Oil Exports to USA may save the main industries of the 3 Provinces that oppose oil pipelines
9920 2018-05-27 16:36:33 @marklevinshow Russian Idiocy. Why would would Putin back the political party for fracking (given its downward effect on oil/gas prices) and a strong military vs. the party that would restrict fracking and continue to weaken the the US military as it pursues appeasement.

9924 2018-05-27 16:35:50 Bertolli Spread (Classic) is a margarine. It's made from olive oil. There is also Bertolli with Butter which is a combination butter and olive oil which reduces the overall saturated fat content while still giving a buttery taste.

9930 2018-05-27 16:34:45 The Dakota pipeline isn’t done. Oh and it already spilled a bunch of oil, contaminating the ground water. Good job, 45. Idiot.
9931 2018-05-27 16:34:40 That’s what I thought. I’d have to cut back the oil to make it not be a congealed mess, or serve it at room temp
9932 2018-05-27 16:34:32 So anything regulated will crash lesser than something unregulated?
In India crude oil is regulated with obvious entry barriers. There are underlying factors which lead to a crash which can be discovered by FA not TA.

9946 2018-05-27 16:33:17 There’s the hope for more oil deliveries diverted from Saudi’s power burn.
9947 2018-05-27 16:32:44 That mf said yee yee within 1 min of shaking his hand, was real proud of being from east Texas, said he was oil field trash and made over $100,000 a year about 46 times, and wanted to take me back to his hotel. I wasn’t saying yee yee back. I was honestly laughing he whole time.
9948 2018-05-27 16:32:41 Brilliant. There needs to be more rogue PR and 100's of truth based blog energy news sites. Unfortunately this probably won't go viral, but funny, cynical and ludacris content that points out the truths in this Calgary based Video in very creative ways might devillianize big oil.
9949 2018-05-27 16:32:32 #Conservatives on minimums: 
1) minimize beer price;
2) minimize gasoline prices when oil prices rise; 
3) increase minimum sentencing for prisoners; 
4) no minimum wage;
5) minimize sex-ed - only abstinence 
6) minimize taxes & lessen social services

9957 2018-05-27 16:32:00 I suspect he just didn't pay enough attention while he was in school. Probably looking at too much social media.
9958 2018-05-27 16:31:23 Investigate the cost of oil being produced!  We’re paying the same price for oil that was 140.00 a barrel last year, as we only pay 70.00 this year?

9981 2018-05-27 16:28:30 Every conflict since World War II has been about the US sticking its nose where it doesn't belong. Our soldiers are used to line the pockets of the rich, not defend this nation. Soldiers are dying defending oil pipelines. We call it spreading democracy. We manufacture conflict.

9988 2018-05-27 16:27:26 too right....Uncle Stephen will become the people's hero.
9989 2018-05-27 16:27:24 Tucker would probably feel & look healthier without animal products.  Livestock production of all types involves administration of chemicals, hormones & other additives you wouldn't put directly in your mouth.  Oil & religious beliefs drive most wars.
9990 2018-05-27 16:27:13 Works especially well for replies to Chelsea Handler. 
9991 2018-05-27 16:26:53 Wouldn't you drain the old oil from your car before putting in new oil? Wouldn't you clean out all the rust before repainting? 

I understand the need to coalesce and move forward, but I prefer not to corrupt and degrade the new with remnants of the old.
9992 2018-05-27 16:26:34 just have some fish oil and cholestorol lowering supplements on the side and you'll be good :) ....I guess
9993 2018-05-27 16:26:30 I think the oil is second reason for the battling ther. It`s like fancy paper ......
First reason could be ,,Great Israel,, from ,, Nil to Euphrat ,, together the  ,Zionist - Wahabits - Rothschild - Empire - USRAEL .... Why not the whole Region ?

9998 2018-05-27 16:25:26 @PMOIndia 4 oil companies wasting resources, helping no one and driving the cost up, all owned by government.. Really needs our PM attention
9999 2018-05-27 16:25:23 @realDonaldTrump #media You ever wonder why The U.S keeps calling Israel there #1 ally even though The U.S is supporting these fuckers with 40 billion a year? Because Netanyahu and his terrorist are destabilizing the middle east for oil and resources Its a Land grab for The 1%

10003 2018-05-27 16:24:35 Orrrr, to minimize the amount of oil you have to cook with and lessen the browning of the diced potatoes.
10004 2018-05-27 16:24:35 สู้ๆ เป็นกำลังใจให้เด้อ
10005 2018-05-27 16:24:34 Just got an oil change and @jiffylube didn’t try to upsell me on anything. #miraclesdohappen
10006 2018-05-27 16:24:26 So once a day @davidhogg111 will be reminding us what a vacuous twit he is.
10007 2018-05-27 16:24:24 Fake news. Chief Lulu Briggs of Moni Pulo is very much alive. The fiction writer is too lazy to do a proper check. He declares a living colossus of the oil sector as late. Shame!!!
10008 2018-05-27 16:24:22 Alt Fact Snake Oil by Trump. The most bigly new scent even Rosanne is wearing. Avail on WH gift shop. I don't make a scent!
10009 2018-05-27 16:23:52 And the Saudis, who I believe we still buy oil from, hate the Iranian regime.
10010 2018-05-27 16:23:39 Lol, awesome.
10011 2018-05-27 16:23:36 chillin on the side of the freeway bc I blew my oil pan on the way to Karmecca in sac. but just a few minutes ago I saw 2 cars hit a boat that detached from someone’s truck. interesting
10012 2018-05-27 16:23:31 And no mention of the best performing commodity of the last 2 years. And if oil's performance recently can be described as 'stable' I am not sure I want to see what instability looks like. I would take these predictions with a large portion of salt.

This is Nigeria! if government finds oil in your backyard it's government property, but if they find weed it's yours and you are going to jail.
10014 2018-05-27 16:23:20 Need to oil Mother soon. Get all the hard-to-reach places.
10015 2018-05-27 16:23:00 No discussion how American Oil companies BRIBED Venezuelan officials that led to a buck a barrel royalties being paid to NOT THE PEOPLE WHO OWNED THE OIL. THIS LED TO CHAVEZ COMING TO POWER IN 1999. THIS IS A FACT.

10019 2018-05-27 16:22:53 Goo Gone should work. As an added bonus, it’s citrus oil based - no harsh chemicals - so it shouldn’t damage the fabric. Saturate, massage it in, let it sit for a few minutes, then hold under warm running water. May take more than one application.
