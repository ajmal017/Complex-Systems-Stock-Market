3 2018-05-11 23:59:33 Yeah, but the filters caught most of it. It was fine after I put some machine oil in the bearings.
4 2018-05-11 23:59:25 I can’t stunt I’ve fucked a girl who got dry pussy on accident, I had to use baby oil to lubricate that mf so I could get off
5 2018-05-11 23:59:17 Now this is really cool .I will order for my daughter on June 1.The lavender oil looks like I could use some benefits from it !!! Happy Mother's Day !!!
6 2018-05-11 23:58:42 Probably should have got an oil change first but I’ll get one Monday if i don’t have jury duty

8 2018-05-11 23:58:18 cooking with hot oil should be fun!
9 2018-05-11 23:58:10 Basically instead of holding together galaxies dark matter pushes them together from the outside. Like a drop of water in oil.
10 2018-05-11 23:58:02 You can make a mask with goat milk yogurt or Greek yogurt, a little bit of turmeric, almond oil or a little bit of finely ground almonds and vitamin e oil...I’ll find you an eye cream to use brb

14 2018-05-11 23:56:18 Russia and KSA are keen for the oil price to be in excess of $80. Of course price can rise and fall. If you are a trader you have to take a view. If you are a country you have to look at macro risks to your country and prepare it for external shocks - systemic or not

16 2018-05-11 23:55:53 I do t think it’s the drain because it has lots of pressure behind it when running. We thought the tractor was on fire because of the fine fog of oil spraying out. Thanks for the help though.

39 2018-05-11 23:54:49 Se dictaminó la quiebra de Oil Combustibles, una de las empresas de Cristóbal López y, si el verdulero de Novaresio sigue vendiendo la lechuga a $180 va a correr con la misma suerte.

42 2018-05-11 23:54:33 Used to have an oil price watch bookmarked. Sludge keep going up so deleted the thing. Bad news every day here so why compound it
43 2018-05-11 23:54:17 The smell of tea tree oil is so clapped but it makes your skin bang 
44 2018-05-11 23:54:04 Just had hot oil explode in my face. 0/10 did not like. AMA.
45 2018-05-11 23:54:03 make sure you change your beard oil every 3000 miles or your beard may overheat and breakdown then you will need to replace it

50 2018-05-11 23:53:20 Can we all just take a moment to "like" and show some "love" to good customer service  I have and the worst of luck when it comes to getting my oil changed

55 2018-05-11 23:52:37 I'll tell you it's about time that women realize they look good naturally brother in trying to lose all the weight I think with women with the little meat on her bones look a lot better than Olive Oil with Popeye that's then anorexic does not look attractive I would never go out

(Cockburn street up on the right/Grafton street left down the hill towards Dingle oil jetty on the River Mersey)
58 2018-05-11 23:52:12 I’ve heard in many cases it never does. Until it’s economically sensible people will not be inclined to do it. 

I know, I know, the big bad oil companies block funding for research, etc. etc. etc.

I changed my car's oil today. I deserve a cookie.
61 2018-05-11 23:51:30 I smell like sesame oil and fish sauce because I almost made pad thai. I didn't because I felt tired and sad. Mostly my whole day has felt like thrashing and I haven't even done that much.
62 2018-05-11 23:51:17 The Burrata is sooooooo good, I hate sharing it. But because I love my husband, I share.

Y'know, you should do a pizza based on that! Those peppers and the olives and that awesome yummy olive oil drizzle on it... om nom nom.

65 2018-05-11 23:50:04 Rex was on board for the oil bribe, not the treason.

Kelly’s in for the racism, not the trash drama.

They’re just trying to do some honest crime here.
66 2018-05-11 23:50:02 Kind of a bad topic but if we kept our oil home we would not have this problem.But then again is it American to tell someone they cant export goods?
67 2018-05-11 23:49:58 Never tell my patients to take this crap. Eat right. Mediterranean diet. Maybe some fish oil if ldl/hdl ratio up
68 2018-05-11 23:49:57 ライブ前に10時間も待つなんてほんとどうかしてるとしか思えないと思うんですよ
69 2018-05-11 23:49:57 I remember there was a time not too long ago when people thought oil would never get back to 100.
70 2018-05-11 23:49:45 A lot of speculation surrounding Iran's oil and Putin getting his oil sold as well.

81 2018-05-11 23:47:49 Styer still hasn’t gotten over loosing millions of dollars from hauling oil in rail cars now that the pipelines have been approved.
82 2018-05-11 23:47:46 1)Oil era la empresa que inyectaba fondos a más de 100 empresas del grupo.
2)Oil no pagó impuestos por 17000 millones, guita de todos los argentinos.
3) o sea que los argentinos manteníamos el grupo de Cristobal López

Let's agree 2 disagree; I think if U work to increase profits of oil/gas/coal/chem at expense of clean air/water U R not good.
86 2018-05-11 23:47:32 #TenBuckTurnbull Pity the libs created parity pricing on oil but haven’t rolled out the policy to include electricity and gas. We have the worlds highest energy bills. If energy prices were cut significantly it would be a tax cut for all

90 2018-05-11 23:47:01 Ryan is nothing but a snake oil salesman. He needs to slither away. He can get campaign $$, but can't do his job to protect  American democracy. He needs to resign NOW.

93 2018-05-11 23:46:40 So they've just been sucking all over the place lately.

99 2018-05-11 23:46:07 @POTUS tell your people they better not be creating a new terrorist group in Iran to attack us so you have a reason to invade for oil and make more strict laws here.
100 2018-05-11 23:45:47 Back to my theory. Under the corruption, you'll find big oil.
101 2018-05-11 23:45:38 to be fair I did this when I was a kid. Now I season it with olive oil, salt, and pepper like a normal adult. But if a little ketchup accidentally gets on there I'm not going to complain
102 2018-05-11 23:45:28 My man changed my oil  we both know how to do it though 
103 2018-05-11 23:45:25 you can buy argan oil at any makeup/hair store (i got this at sally’s) and you have to put it in (or mix with conditoner) and leave it in for a few hours and then rinse it out!!! i used to use this once every couple of weeks when i was dying my hair a lot
104 2018-05-11 23:45:13 Never been into midnight oil. Too political and hypocritical.  Garrett, the singer , joined a nuclear disarmament political party. , argued on tv with the then labor government. A few years later, he joined the labor party and became minister for environment and arts

106 2018-05-11 23:44:53 Erin, we are terribly sorry to hear about the experience at your dealer. Have you been able to speak with the Service Mgr. regarding your recent visit after the oil change? Please feel free to DM us if there is anything we could look into for you. Thank you. ^FC
107 2018-05-11 23:44:41 I'm working too. But I know a number of the oil companies offer the alternate friday off thing.
108 2018-05-11 23:44:26 Buy big oil!!! It's at 70 bucks a barrel and headed to 90 by the END of summer and they are calling over $100 by next year.
109 2018-05-11 23:44:25 Estamos vendo o oposto. Sobe junto com oil.
110 2018-05-11 23:44:20 Considering our neighbors to the south schizophrenic (no offence) way of doing business it’s quite impressive that Canada has been virtually unaffected by it.With oil on the rise,low interest rates,a solid job market & Trump 1/2 way to being gone,things are looking bright !
111 2018-05-11 23:44:14 Spray dry ice @DocYilk see in lab at university under hoods! All chemistry @ILAttyGeneral experiments drag buckets of salt water from sea use filter liner @USGS fish fry if oil base vs salt water. Questions of facts. Test always safest @usedgov 15min!Migrants guilty©Edu tax

We're playing Snake Oil and everyone's letting me pick random cards for them to pitch. It's uh. Leading to some interesting products XD
115 2018-05-11 23:43:52 @KTRTRS Sir, I have an idea. Can we open a state government shops at all local bus stops, Railway station & Govt public places to sale Govt undertaken production products. Exp: Vijay milk, oil, dairy products. Bring one good Govt scheme please..............
116 2018-05-11 23:43:50 I get what your saying. So just read it as cucumber salad. I used toasted sesame seed oil and rice wine vinegar which are typical ingredients in Chinese and Japanese dishes.
117 2018-05-11 23:43:49 Finally installed a new gasket on my other car and now I need two new tires and maybe an oil change.

But for now, I'm gonna go watch Infinity War  because Spidey.

121 2018-05-11 23:43:11 I’ve been at subaru forever it’s just a fucking oil change ughhHhHh
122 2018-05-11 23:42:53 Try coconut oil. Tastes great less filling.
123 2018-05-11 23:42:45 Having said that,Lake Megantic was bakken oil from North Dakota and area. The question that needs asking, is who is funding the protesters against pipelines? Follow the money I’m thinking. Who stands to profit from no pipelines?
124 2018-05-11 23:42:28 Really? Who do you think profits from the shredded deal? RUSSIA because oil prices are going up which RUSSIA profits from. There's your reason.
125 2018-05-11 23:41:59 You really like that awesome bread with the seasoned extra virgin olive oil?
126 2018-05-11 23:41:56 Hey didn't Al Gore sell his media empire to Al Jazeera based in Qatar, a natural gas and oil rich country?
127 2018-05-11 23:41:55 It morphed into the Strategic Oil Reserve after the war.. the relationship with the Sicilian Mafia grew eventually manifesting into first
128 2018-05-11 23:41:51 You have no clue do you. The world demand for oil isn’t going anywhere soon. Let that sink in.
129 2018-05-11 23:41:45 Trouble maker !!! All your trying to do is destabilize the region so barrels of oil can rise so you and your buddy’s get richer #BASTA
130 2018-05-11 23:41:09 So could water be wet by other liquids?Such as oil by any chance?
131 2018-05-11 23:41:07 It happened with my other nose ring. Dirt gets trapped in the hole so you just put tea tree oil on it to clean it out until it dries up. But I was picking at it so it really just got worse lol
132 2018-05-11 23:41:07 Trump wants all your money and oil. Keep dreaming.
133 2018-05-11 23:41:00 حسبنا الله ونعم الوكيل
134 2018-05-11 23:40:43 I didn't think that oil would be in such a water based product but oh well
135 2018-05-11 23:40:34 So , hey. 7:30 at night and I'm suddenly famished. Let's fry some chicken.
(simple seasoning; salt, pepper, coriander, a little garlic and onion powder. Coconut oil is a must).
136 2018-05-11 23:40:33 @jannarden Well I am used to being a rebel in this anti social red neck Country, so Superwoman is going to side with Jann, our animals & the nature that be which surrounds us is more important then the oil industry! Switch to Solar Power/ electric engines! No Tar Sands! XOXOXOX
137 2018-05-11 23:40:33 The list is a lot larger than profitable oil companies. Recently there was Toyota and Apple.
138 2018-05-11 23:40:32 And in case you refuse to look into things on your own, one major reason gas prices started to rise? Hurricane Harvey at the end of last year hit nearly a third of our refineries. Then we also have issues elsewhere, where we are getting oil from (other countries). Educate, honey.
139 2018-05-11 23:40:31 My face produces too much fucking oil

142 2018-05-11 23:40:04 I work in the patch in Alberta. First off, a large portion of heavy bitumen is a mining operation. Some is conventional production by drill-bit. He is talking about having to dilute heavy oil to make it pumpable in a pipeline. That’s where conventional light sweet oil comes in.
143 2018-05-11 23:40:00 i love the oil it makes
144 2018-05-11 23:39:59 Priorities: oil blotting in Macy’s
145 2018-05-11 23:39:45 My car is rattling cause there's an oil leak and I need to put oil in and it's really obnoxious and I should get on it but I never do when I should
146 2018-05-11 23:39:44 I just realised that the reason my skin has been overly dry and breaking out is because there was castor oil in my sheet mask
147 2018-05-11 23:39:38 safe to say that bullshit story about using baby oil to get fake tan off is fuckin BULLSHIT
148 2018-05-11 23:39:33 Bro i did to at first lmao, these things you pick up over the years, took it to my guy, he said no was wondering why my chain was so dry, it removes alot of the important grease and oil in it.
149 2018-05-11 23:39:16 @Trevornoah watchd ur utube on exiting Iran deal,  UK, DE and FR all pleaded with DT to stay in.  I dont think Russia did prolly because they potentially gain billions from high oil prices.  Is this DT way of payback to Putin and company?
150 2018-05-11 23:39:08 I am mostly whole food with olive oil, avocado oil, Non-GMO black soy beans, hemp, avocado, chia, sacha Inchi seeds, natto, @bramisnacks, baru nuts, nuts and seeds, non-starchy veggies by the heaps, coconut.
151 2018-05-11 23:38:59 What if oil prices drop suddenly below 40$? what is the mechanism to support the revenue?
152 2018-05-11 23:38:53 It is hard to use the word environmentalist and Al Gore in the same sentence. However Americans are against the pipe line because it will keep US oil prices from Canada discounted.

154 2018-05-11 23:38:25 I was cooking and oil fell on my hand it hurts but not realyy
155 2018-05-11 23:38:12 carbon tax affects everything that is delivered via fossil fuels - comp need to recoup their increases - we import lots of food due to winter and not a long growing season. we heat homes/business because of cold temps. its on hydro, gas, propane, oil...everything
156 2018-05-11 23:38:04 Build an oil refinery in B.C. - brilliant idea but I suspect it’s probably just another ‘pipe dream.’ Pun intended!
157 2018-05-11 23:37:32 Research oil cleansing. You only need to do it once or twice a week, depending on how bad your blackheads are. It also helps with flakiness and acne :)
158 2018-05-11 23:37:31 I found this essential oil that nourish your skin and helps you sleep 
159 2018-05-11 23:37:18 just finished making my own granola over here in china. lovely stuff! oats, honey, coconut oil, cinnamon, dried sweet potatoes chopped, blueberries, ran out of raisins & all stirred "fried" in the wok. made enough for a week or two. internet recipe adapted. bon apetite.
160 2018-05-11 23:37:16 as much as i like Tweed, i hate that they remove terpenes from the only oil i can afford to buy. All the other ones have terpenes except Quinn.
161 2018-05-11 23:37:10 No she’s not. If woods are burnt to the ground, it will come back beautiful and green. There’s a tree in Ca. Called sequoia ( I believe that’s the tree)that only reproduces with fire. Nature only balks at man made garage. Plastic floating in ocean not finding oil replacement etc.

164 2018-05-11 23:36:30 Saul, you remember:
1/ Carter's solution to rising oil prices & stagnant economy? Told auto industry to make cars more fuel efficient while lowering their cost prices. Told coal industry dig more coal/longer hours lower wages!
165 2018-05-11 23:36:13 Sorry, Glueck blocked us, or we would respond to her directly.  You only have 11 followers after more than a year! What expertise do you have? What do you know about oil and gas or alternative energy? What do you know about environmental health? What do you know about toxicity?
166 2018-05-11 23:36:07 You are fronting about the baby oil lol I think that you want to see how many people that you can mesmerize with your angelic flawlessness 
167 2018-05-11 23:35:55 If people only knew what the payments are on Brad wall P3 projects payments they would know why there is no money for education or anything else.
Get use to it unless we get $100 oil it will be tough for many years.
168 2018-05-11 23:35:46 Tupperware is just plastic. Plastic is just oil.  Oil is just bones. One day we will be the tupperware.
169 2018-05-11 23:35:32 Saudi are your friends. Didn't you know that? Probably your life moves by Saudi oil. 
170 2018-05-11 23:35:30 Every time! Now Israel is granting Rosthchild& Murdoch oil drilling/fracking rights in Golan Heights?? Illegal but who's noticing? All watching Trump/ Kim Jong Un comedy show? I despair but its all part of the agenda?
171 2018-05-11 23:35:28 Chega a ser RIDÍCULO falarmos em dólar a 4,00 com este índice CMDT que temos,e projeções de OIL, Minério nas máximas da década no próximo biênio.

Não esqueçamos que somos um fazenda, APENAS isto, e nossos produtos estão valorizando no mundo, portanto, mais moeda entra e DOL cai.

174 2018-05-11 23:35:19 why must i stain every piece of clothing i love with olive oil
175 2018-05-11 23:35:05 It’s also highly annoying asking a restaurant if they can grill your chicken without butter or oil and they tell you no... shouldn’t that make your life easier? Just throw the meat on the grill.
176 2018-05-11 23:34:54 こわい。
177 2018-05-11 23:34:51 Are the regulations partisan or who gets to have which oil? Who picks who get good vs. evil oil?
178 2018-05-11 23:34:35 Do...do they think we import oil from Iran?
179 2018-05-11 23:34:30 I'm not the only one who had a rough day. He was rushed to Tay Tay's by nanny Denise Hamby for some herbal wound wash (calendula, green tea, comfrey oil), honey spread, arnica and LOT'S of hugs through the tears.  

I think he's going to be fine

185 2018-05-11 23:33:24 You know what the U.N. should be doing?

And Use Green Oil once it is figured out

Maybe make a Movie out of this
186 2018-05-11 23:33:17 I guess gas and oil and grants...and also an administration  that was willing to spend money on things worth while
187 2018-05-11 23:33:08 Where does baby oil come from?
188 2018-05-11 23:33:06 Why is North so much interested in the oil in the South that they keep quiet of the uranium in the North
189 2018-05-11 23:32:49 these mechanics are really debating whether you’re born gay in front of my big ass at the body shop. Like I’m just tryin to get my oil changed sis

198 2018-05-11 23:32:04 Trump , gas prices going up , stock market going down . Your oil friends are banking it . Tax changes helping the wealthy . I’m not seeing anything great for the average American .  Please resign before there is nothing good left for us .
199 2018-05-11 23:32:02 reason I asked is bc last time I was trying to clean some lashes the black was like almost coming off and I do use an oil based one
200 2018-05-11 23:31:52 Nice depending how much you ride id oil chain ever 2 or 3 hundred miles, dont use those cleaners to clean the chain in the long run they ruin it.  Most importantly keep crank and rear clog free of junk.

202 2018-05-11 23:31:46 @AnushkaSharma ji, Would you like to place order for cold press virgin Almond oil made by Kaivalyam Body & Soul. Project of my wife, yoga Therapist. Ingredients - Almonds. No chemicals. No preservatives. Your one order can make us boost confidence. Pls allow us chance.
203 2018-05-11 23:31:42 Keep it up.  Don’t put any heat or color on it.  Leave it alone.  Argan oil once every two weeks... and the rest I think is genetics. But we’ll talk about nutrition in the podcast.

207 2018-05-11 23:30:40 @DonaldJTrumpJr you have no influence, you are disposable, ask @RudyGiuliani the mayor of the world, who stored fuel oil in the WTC even when he was told not to after the first attack
208 2018-05-11 23:30:37 but we import dirty oil from wherever via fossil fuel tanker & that comp is not responsible for anything but if they spill oil etc in water..... fair huh? Our gov't is hypocritical that way as its better to leave in ground & import oil from Saudi that is not ethical or as clean!
209 2018-05-11 23:30:36 I get a weird satisfaction from doing my own oil changes even though the oil is a whole bag  Foreign whip problems
210 2018-05-11 23:30:18 Very deceptive nonsense
Trying to pretend that the exodus of drilling rigs is somehow attached to the rejection of pipelines rather than it's true cause of the price of oil crashing, is remarkably disingenuous
211 2018-05-11 23:30:06 There you go, 20% royalty to all oil producer states. GST removed! Oil price down... many more to come. No matter what, hope this PH goverment to sustain their performance! #newmalaysia #newera #savemalaysia #togetherwemakeithappen

215 2018-05-11 23:29:30 I don’t think the one I’m using now is oil free but I’m not 100% sure

217 2018-05-11 23:29:14  always wondered if Nothing Visible was a nod to Oil Slick
218 2018-05-11 23:29:11 The idea of gasoline pills has been used by conmen for nearly a century. Don't you think that if Big Oil had a method to transmute H2O into complex organic molecules they'd use it to their advantage, instead of using the hard and expensive method of pumping it from the ground?
219 2018-05-11 23:28:47 They could be recycled but we are good at solving one issue whilst creating another for the next generation to fix. ( coal, oil, etc)
220 2018-05-11 23:28:45 Experienced my first oil wrestling event in that there establishment..
221 2018-05-11 23:28:40  haha yes them edges need that rest and oil... mine too tho #noshade
222 2018-05-11 23:28:30 Those poor oil companies help create the world we have today. Everything around you is there because of oil. You think we could just stop using oil completely? How out of touch!
223 2018-05-11 23:28:23 It’ll be the only topic of conversation at the oil cooler
224 2018-05-11 23:28:04 [With the way she went on of treason, hanging and boiling oil, what was to stop her from taking revenge on him if he ever upset her enough? She knows he’s afraid of and doesn’t understand magic.]
225 2018-05-11 23:28:04 Film the bottom with water. Cook them with the lid on for 10 minutes. Discard the water and fry them in a little bit of oil to get the level of crispiness that you want. 

I used to be mystified by sausages too. Now, I can cook them blindfolded.
226 2018-05-11 23:27:45 Back in the 1970's lathering your body up with oil and sun bathing to make your skin glow was a huge beauty trend. For 2018, we would like to remind everyone that sunscreen is a much better alternative. #FlashbackFriday #TheMoreYouKnow #skincarethread #ciremcosmetics

232 2018-05-11 23:27:16 We had a patient last week we couldn't help because the owner, despite coming in, didn't let anyone touch her dog, didn't believe in medicine, was practically yelling at the dog that she wouldn't let us hurt him, and wanted an essential oil therapy recommendation 
233 2018-05-11 23:27:13 My mom used to run for me when I was a medical patient, and on bad pain days sometimes she was able to surprise me will oil or weed. It made everything so much easier.
234 2018-05-11 23:27:13 hey! i never learned how to paint with oil in trad, i was referring to the techniques being used such as starting from the background and overlaying your colors over and over again... the few vids sseuregi rec'd are very self-explanatory
235 2018-05-11 23:27:01 Topped it off with grated Parmesan and paired with with baguettes and seasoned olive oil.
236 2018-05-11 23:26:51 thx... simple terms - we sell crude oil that is refined into gas for a car ... corp in Canada is resp for all carbon emissions from pumping it out of ground to the exhaust coming out of your car exhaust pipe (up and down stream emissions)
237 2018-05-11 23:26:50 すごい。私人が多いとこ苦手だから折れそう..
238 2018-05-11 23:26:49 If oil production is ramping up so much in the United States, why are gas prices climbing so high? Since it's made right here shouldn't it be cheaper than it was before. Has gas price gouging become the norm again? Very irritating!

242 2018-05-11 23:26:31 Brought a new body oil for baby. He loves bed coming home to me showered fresh with a new scent  the surprise look on his face melts my heart yo. The little things

244 2018-05-11 23:26:25 The dump was the plan, it bumped up oil prices and caused a spike in the ruble. Putin's investment in tRUmp is paying off in spades
245 2018-05-11 23:26:11 Cheaper power certainly won't harm their influence. Reduced dependence on oil gives poor oil importing nations more freedom & power.
246 2018-05-11 23:26:11 High oil and gas prices robbing Americans of their hard earned money. But all our government want us to focus on is foreign policy decisions and made up drama.  If freaking bull crap!!!!!
247 2018-05-11 23:26:10 right. plus he better give his edges a rest from those braids. Rub some castor oil on it.

249 2018-05-11 23:26:04 It's not dangerous FFS; I'm guessing you're ok with oil extraction from the North Sea, which do you think is more dangerous?
250 2018-05-11 23:26:02 Need to build more pipelines because we need the funds from the sale of oil to fund renewable energy infrastructures. The funds help us transition into green energy. Otherwise it would not be possible.

Start the morning with blending 1-2tbls (don't stir in-doesnt work the same) in2 freshly brewed black coffee u can + cinnamon or vanilla if U desire. It's a frothy coffee without the milk. 

I also drink it through the day. Ive lost 12lbs in a month research it.x

279 2018-05-11 23:20:57 If we stopped wanting non~first world country's oil, they would soon want us to start again. What else have you got to offer? They act like oil is a personal achievement. It was worthless before we gave it value. They didn't even know it was there before we told them.
280 2018-05-11 23:20:50 oh ok i used to add like a tiny drop of baby oil but it lessened like the duration of it :o i'll try just swirling it around haha

282 2018-05-11 23:20:29 Don't do it! Keep growing it; a bit of beard oil and balm to keep it neat and you'll be looking glorious.
283 2018-05-11 23:20:21 Sir I want to work with Forte oil
284 2018-05-11 23:20:08 Ironic that trees chopped to allow more cars on a soldiers memorial. Oil supply, climate change caused by oil use, are now major causes of increased conflict.
285 2018-05-11 23:20:06 Que locuras, sí. La tesis de Luis Videgaray se titula "The fiscal response to oil shocks". 

Prácticamente ese cabrón se preparó en una de las mejores escuelas del mundo para implementar políticas que aplicaría después de la privatización que hicieron.

289 2018-05-11 23:19:42 No and that's why your foreign reserved has been jacked up from $23b to $47b just in 3 year with the price of crude less than $67 pb. Remember some rogues depleted the same foreign reserved from $43b to $23b despite the oil boom price above $120pb

291 2018-05-11 23:18:49 If you believe that, you probably take snake oil as a medicine.
292 2018-05-11 23:18:47 Get @thewavysheababy’s beard butter, wash your face with hot/cold water every night to keep your pores clear, and if it gets itchy massage in a little tea tree oil on your face then rinse with cold water
293 2018-05-11 23:18:35 Brewed two big supplies of my hair growth oil today. I love that stuff

302 2018-05-11 23:16:51 My job consists of Basically bathing in oil. And wondering if they’ll let me go home early if I stab myself in the hand with a bread knife
303 2018-05-11 23:15:55 I'm not fond of any form of corporate welfare. But if it was the Conservatives it would be a tax cut for doing nothing new in oil, with an absurd claim about jobs.
304 2018-05-11 23:15:39 Idea of relying on foreign companies for the oil anyway and we will run out of fossil fuels so many dinosaurs that dyed you another concept Hollow vision ATV that projects holographic and details like watching a Regular Show with sky land sea air clouds projected in the hologram
305 2018-05-11 23:15:36 @MeghanMcCain I see you on The View & respect you. I don't accept that your dad is "dying" and I wish he would use the "solution" which I tweeted to him a month ago: FECO or RSO cannabis oil. Join FB group, Cannabis Kills Cancer SA bc it DOES kill cancer. I'd love to discuss it.
306 2018-05-11 23:15:28 raw also is awesome if you can get good stuff. Cut into little coins, olive oil, good salt & a nice sharp cheese.
307 2018-05-11 23:15:14 Because he's had Olives oil?
308 2018-05-11 23:15:13 Innocent people dying in Syria due to this nation's bloodthirsty agenda of empirical domination and conquest of the entire Earth for oil and we're talking about mixing drinks. Lol.

312 2018-05-11 23:13:50 Alberta oil is more ethical and environmentally responsible than most oil the world over. Why not take a stand against Saudi oil or any global sources filling tankers which at great risk traverse the oceans?  Is there a particular reason you target Canada?

316 2018-05-11 23:13:13 Coconut oil saves lives tho, anything else coconut can fuck right off
317 2018-05-11 23:13:05 My first weekend here at Sunset Kia of Auburn come help me make it a good one! HUGE incentives on new vehicle as well as a LifeTime Warranty and Oil changes for life. Anyone needs a new rig I’m your guy!!
318 2018-05-11 23:12:53 My new New Year’s Resolution is to change the car oil without having to use Dishwasher Detergent on the cement when I’m done
319 2018-05-11 23:12:50 Corporate culture deprives us of our generosity and fundamental humanity.  If you are OK with subsidizing already profitable oil companies but not OK with helping a person who is sick...
320 2018-05-11 23:12:42 Damn right! Look at how many reps they employ. Look at all the swag they give doctors. Doctors profit big time! Look at what they spend in adverts. Why advertise a necessity? Because their snake oil isn't a necessity. Their cures will lead you back to the dr. Gross!
321 2018-05-11 23:12:41 Seems no one in DC ever heard of the aphorism “All that glitters is not gold.” Cohen’s already proven he was...and is...the sleaziest kind of amateur snake oil salesman. Before dropping the cash, beware of anyone who doesn’t offer a full 90 day refund.
322 2018-05-11 23:12:37 Shame on them for being mean. 1st cars are the best, make sure to check and change oil every 3000 miles. Cheaper than new engine. 
323 2018-05-11 23:12:31 @RocketLeague you guys should add a oil slick like paint finish or paint variant for items. Like a chrome but rainbow-ish
324 2018-05-11 23:12:21 People fight tooth and nail for oil companies, but ignore the most productive and modern industries such tech, tourism and advanced manufacturing.
325 2018-05-11 23:12:20 Sitting in a car dealership alone on a Friday night while waiting for your car to get an oil change, with Harry Styles playing on the tinny speakers overhead, is a unique kind of Mood.
326 2018-05-11 23:12:20 Do you have greasy hair from spilling warm oil all over yourself as you accidentally make a mess when you’re trying to change your car oil? Never fear, @DawnDish is a savior

334 2018-05-11 23:10:57 Hi Eric! Liquid Butter Alternatives are designed to replace butter applications. Just like butter, it is not made nor should it be used as a frying oil replacement. The product is intended to be used to help create sauces, clarifying and for sautéing.

348 2018-05-11 23:09:12 My bet is the NK sideshow is simply a distraction from the unilateral exit from Iran Nuke Agreement to fill the pockets of oil interests. (i.e, Putin & Co, T. Boone, Koch Bros, etc). 
#TrumpNuts
349 2018-05-11 23:09:05 The economy is in full recovery, Jason. Oil prices are expected to continue to rise. The diversification is on track. Unemployment is down, salaries are up. If that is a disaster, I'll take it over the slash and burn of your plan which will drive us back into recession.
350 2018-05-11 23:08:43 All fun & games till the cooking oil jumps and burns a titty 
351 2018-05-11 23:08:40 I have only used like the big samples of DE stuff but none of it really impressed me very much maybe I'm biased the whole brand seems so stupid to me once I saw they have like 75 dollar marula oil
352 2018-05-11 23:08:35 AK Senate debates the bill to sell bonds to pay for oil and gas tax credits, House Bill 331. @wielechowski offers Amendment 1, which would delete a section requiring that legal challenges be filed within 45 days. It's defeated, 5-14. #akleg
353 2018-05-11 23:08:28 Ole Jim Taggert has been an oil man for years and knows when negotiating needs a subtle touch.
354 2018-05-11 23:08:25 when they legalize weed in massachusetts, i’m gonna go to a dispensary and find out about how the different products work. cbd oil, so far as i’ve heard, does -something- but whether it actually alleviates pain/anxiety I don’t know. I can see how maybe it does.

379 2018-05-11 23:05:03 And now the Senate is taking up HB 331, the "let's pay off our oil tax credit bill with bonds" bill. Sen. Wielechowski has several amendments. The first one up would remove this provision that would limit legal challenge to 45 days. #akleg
380 2018-05-11 23:04:58 How are Trump's unilateral Iran sanctions going to work? US stops buying Iran oil. Oil poor countries buy more oil from Iran. Market efficiency will protect Iran. US sanctions won't work without EU allies. EU can keep Iran deal alive until next administration.

384 2018-05-11 23:04:05 Oil temperature sensor. Not particularly common failure, but the same part is on all the big KTMs. Watch out for the oil temperature being suspiciously low.
385 2018-05-11 23:04:03 Yeah. I am.  I'd pay a bit more to stop this stupid rationing of healthcare.  And govt shld take some of the billions we spend subsidizing already-profitable oil companies and use that.  Why aren't you complaining about foreign oil subsidies?

394 2018-05-11 23:03:11 R-Steve, it’s a horrible product. But, the pipelines are built, controlled, maintained, inspected and taxed by British Columbians and Albertans, for the betterment of Canada.
If we don’t have faith in ourselves to handle this without catastrophe, why lead the world in oil safety?

Climate Change Deniers are paid by Oil and Gas companies. Check that.  Deregulating industry standards will be dangerous to workers as well as the environment... I can go on and on...
411 2018-05-11 23:00:47 And then when you get in you will allow all oil companies to do what they want and piss on the people of Ontario.  Ford on the other hand will help everyone accept the rich by giving everyone tax breaks and fix the hydro mess your party created.

420 2018-05-11 22:58:47 @OkamiSwan Hey can I ask real quick, do you know if your stickers are vinyl or waterproof? I'm thinking about where I'd like to put the one you gave me and if heat or hand oil would make it fade.
421 2018-05-11 22:58:26 WON'T hold my breath til Any Corporation Pays for Its Crimes beyond a paltry $ fine.

Does he think the 47% he insulted will vote for him if they think he's suddenly got blue collar tastes? I think his image problem is a little deeper than some pig parts are going to solve. He's like a hot dog, full of sh*t.

425 2018-05-11 22:57:30 with the pipeline there will be a higher flow of oil which means it will run out faster. the pipeline is only aiding our addiction to oil. any oil spill is still an oil spill

427 2018-05-11 22:56:48 Good job backing out of Iran Deal Comrade.  Oil prices up, Russia benefits.

-vigorous exercise
429 2018-05-11 22:56:09 Blofeld's oil rig (interior) set looks incredibly cheap and unglamorous for such an iconic big bad. Not Ken Adams best work...
430 2018-05-11 22:55:34 Iran does not export oil to America
431 2018-05-11 22:55:12 Yeah Thanks for dying and being mutilated and getting PSD. While fighting for Israel, US Imperialism, alt-right Evangelist/Christians and as always oil or any natural resources we need to rob.
432 2018-05-11 22:53:58 That is y the soldiers of Islam have been sent to Europe to invade Expand & Conquer.
Saudi as nothing  if they don't have Oil. But have everything if they own/have Europe in their control.
No one believes for 1 minute that Muslims love us. R u mad lol
433 2018-05-11 22:53:42 Okay but for real, coconut oil for the hair is the truth.
434 2018-05-11 22:53:24 i need to get a oil change.. & wheel alignment, plus new tires. like its not a car, if the wheels aint right!
435 2018-05-11 22:53:19 Should I spend a grip of money trying some fancy cbd oil for my many physical and emotional failings? Pretty skeptical of the coconut oil-esque marketing/ferver.
436 2018-05-11 22:53:10 I reviewed the Chilcot Report 12 day live read. It was actually fun but I ended up going home like four days early and just staying in bed having unsettling dreams about Morningside being under attack for its oil.
437 2018-05-11 22:52:57 Wanted to use a coupon for a 20 dollar oil change. It says mustake online appointment. The store says their online system is down. They tell me they have another coupon I could use for a $20.00 oil change. I say sweet let's do it. He them says they can't do it until next week
438 2018-05-11 22:52:33 It's an expansion of an existing pipeline. OIL sands oil is cleaner than the California oilpatch and more ethical than Saudi oil. Better yet, mind your own friggin' business.  #BuildTMX
439 2018-05-11 22:52:28 Oil block problem.
440 2018-05-11 22:52:23 OMG!!! The other day I covered myself in tanning oil and alllll my fake tan washed off in the shower- all makes sense now
441 2018-05-11 22:52:22 PSA: anyone who wants nice smooth, soft legs tomorrow just apply coconut oil on your legs, throw on sweats, and go to sleep. Tomorrow your legs will be smooth and soft as a baby’s butt. 
442 2018-05-11 22:51:37 We deserve a president that benefits our country, not one that is raping its people financially (useless weekly Florida trips), giving away it's resources: natl parks (big oil/cattle grazing), promoting racism and hatred. We deserve a REAL president.

448 2018-05-11 22:50:25 4 yrs ago, 2014, oil went to $25, along w Russian, Alaskan economies.

461 2018-05-11 22:47:50 I'm allergic to peanut oil, so I can't have most peanut based spreads unless they use a different oil, but growing up I wasn't allergic. I ate both chunky and smooth, whatever we had,but jif is the best brand, even if I can't have it anymore, you just can't deny it.

475 2018-05-11 22:46:05 Seems like Kaiser Permanente is being run by a liberal leadership now.  The protocol has changed.  Doctors are now prescribing marijuana (huge cost), hemp oil, and vitamins, instead of medication.  If I am going to treat myself naturally, why go to them in the first place then? ~
476 2018-05-11 22:45:57 BC never had multiple oil booms that inflated living costs though.  The high costs are messed up. But it's a uniquely Alberta problem that cutting essential services won't solve. The only solution is to find a way for wealthy companies to stop inflating costs for the rest of us.

478 2018-05-11 22:45:34 If jet fuel is tight, airline will start increasing their hedge, I suppose that will kill the backwardation as well. I know you folks are concerned the oil price will drop if backwardation disappears. Though, airline only increases hedge upon seeing big future price increase.

493 2018-05-11 22:44:13 Also agree, all this is down to the supply of Oil to the West. Saudi Arabia has got most of the UK and Europe by the Balls as the World depends on it and they are our main supplier. Imagine when stocks start diminishing I can see all Hell breaking loose.
494 2018-05-11 22:44:09 I gave myself a foot massage with vitamin E oil and rose oil and just admired how our feet are really our immediate connection to Mother Earth

503 2018-05-11 22:42:52 Moving subsidies away from oil and into renewables would accelerate the change. Yes, impacts vary. But in this case its not given that the poor lose.

517 2018-05-11 22:41:12 It mean they can sell the oil but can't get the money out. They might have to exchange oil for food.
518 2018-05-11 22:41:09 Yet 2.3 billion in subsidies to oil and gas the biggest industry in Canada is not a handout? Remind me again Rick how much profit did the oil & gas industry make last year??

528 2018-05-11 22:39:56 @WSJ If oil revenue from the Central Bank of Iran is funneled through the U.A.E then through Iranian firms ending up in the hands of Quds Forces who can then launch rocket attacks from Syria against Israel and allies--why do you protect fossil fuel dependence?

531 2018-05-11 22:39:38 Well, briefly:
1) AB oil is cleaner than some other options out there.
2) Many AB voters are not climate activists, but care mostly about the economy. If KM expansion fails, Notley loses votes, JKenney gains votes. If he wins, #ClimateAction reverses in AB, ripples across Canada

536 2018-05-11 22:39:13 Back in the day, I took Alli to lose some weight.  I don't know if I lost weight thanks to it, but it did make me shit an oil streak for like weeks.
537 2018-05-11 22:39:07 it’s about:

—hatred of Obama
—driving up oil prices (benefits US producers and Saudis)
—siding with Netanyahu (red meat for US end-times evangelicals)
— creating economic conflict with NATO Europe (pleases Putin)
—hope to goad Iran into restarting program, thus a pretext for war
538 2018-05-11 22:39:02 #Leave had 40 years for planning. They didn't. All smoke, ruffled feathers, testosterone and snake oil.
Welcome to the real  world.
You own it, deal with it and #EnjoyYourBrexit
539 2018-05-11 22:38:56 Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world, larger than the Saudis. As much as #3 & #4 combined. US is #10. Venezuela not even in top 10 of output. 75% of nation has lost avg of 19 lbs. They are literally starving on mountains of blk gold. But everyone is equal in misery
540 2018-05-11 22:38:48 and oil prices are up... just wait til they hit the gas pump....

543 2018-05-11 22:38:32 but i’m tryna tell him if i put coconut oil on my butthole; boom! you got an almond joy.
544 2018-05-11 22:38:29 @PressSec You're not even trying anymore.  You're nothing but a shill for the biggest snake oil salesman the world has ever seen.  You have no morals or ethics and your professional value has been destroyed.  Your children and history will judge you harshly.
545 2018-05-11 22:38:20 Canadians take it and do nothing about it so we'll continue to get ripped off. Doubt this would happen if we priced by the gallon and we kept some of our own oil. #Canada #Ontario
546 2018-05-11 22:38:01 @SenJohnMcCain i want to offer you insite on cbd or rso oil on your cancer please find some rso oil this will stop thw growth or your cancer and maybe even cure you.  Prayers for you
547 2018-05-11 22:37:59 I use essential oils with a carrier oil like castor, coconut or olive. I made sure to use acv. I massaged it with oil too to stimulate growth.
548 2018-05-11 22:37:36 Tea tree oil?
549 2018-05-11 22:37:20 En medio de tanta incertidumbre la justicia quebró Oil y Cristobal Lopez, sin empresas.
No todo está perdido.

550 2018-05-11 22:37:07 This is true, unfortunately most salad dressings in restaurants are made with this crap. Not that vegetable/canola oil is any better for you, but beware the Soy, friends. You will find it in sweeter breads as well
551 2018-05-11 22:36:50 It has to be processed tho lol. Only a higher level thinker would reduce that. Alternatively, a sun sag and Aries moon (like myself) mayyyy be the middle ground between both of our theories. Maybe EYE discovered Argan oil... another thankless work 
552 2018-05-11 22:36:48 The rest of the world is experimenting with innovative environmental projects. The US govt is attempting to jam gas, oil & pipeline projects at us. Even in the Arctic.
553 2018-05-11 22:36:47 You can get California Olive Ranch Olive Oil, their first choice at many stores, Kroger, whole foods, winco, even Wal-mart. Google "Where to buy ___Olive oil brand here__. and it should tell you what you need to know.
554 2018-05-11 22:36:47 I’m so used to my mom asking have I checked the oil and other fluids in my car. I be checking it everyday before I pull off lol. Man it’s a habit now
555 2018-05-11 22:36:44 Got u. But two major economies have fallen on hard times since oil dropped a few years ago. Russia and Saudi Arabia/UAE.
556 2018-05-11 22:36:35 Judging from the size of Popeye's forearms, I'm guessing that Olive Oil didn't put out much.
557 2018-05-11 22:36:28 More B.S. from the commander-in-chief?
#GWBush #SadamHusseinsWeaponsofMassDestruction Hundreds of thousands of Iraki civilians murdered, complete chaos in the Middle East. #ISIS How many dead American soldiers? For what? Oil? #Cheney 's orgasms?
Have we forgotten? Forgiven?
558 2018-05-11 22:36:22 Hillary was in New Zealand securing "hush"-money from that government, and she is going to Philippines now? 

Can't possibly be connected, but maybe my insane idea gives people better ideas. @GeorgWebb has explained how nukes can be used for oil/gas extraction, and who has them
559 2018-05-11 22:36:22 Fresh oil change, but gas prices still high so I’m staying my ass home 
560 2018-05-11 22:36:13 If I fail this AP US History exam, I'm retaking it next year just to redeem myself.
561 2018-05-11 22:35:36 He doesn’t wash his hair he just uses the oil to slicknit back.
562 2018-05-11 22:35:29 Tell him the original reason for the name! 
In the olden days a man needed a pouch for his scythe sharpening stone. Made of animal skin turned inside out. Hairy slit moist with oil to keep stone moist!
563 2018-05-11 22:35:23 Did you know Canada has an estimated 178.6 billion barrels of oil? #funfactfriday
564 2018-05-11 22:35:23 What a great idea, then all the borders would collapse, there would be another Isis, oil priced would go threw the roof and all the Jews in Iran would be dead and lots of Americans would end up in body bags.
565 2018-05-11 22:35:21 
566 2018-05-11 22:35:18 Lol you know Nigeria had began to welcome recession at that point in time when the price of oil fell drastically.
567 2018-05-11 22:35:12 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
568 2018-05-11 22:35:10 corrupt dirty deals all across the world in the name of islam and oil..more corruption in the world than good honest people .. we have an uphill battle .. but we will will in the end..we will win by voting out LIB/LAB/TORY parties. we need new blood #forbritain
569 2018-05-11 22:35:09 Yep. That's great way to spread an unevidenced belief and villify those who don't buy it at face value. Works for snake oil salesmen and Ponzi schemes too.
570 2018-05-11 22:34:58 This new oil i got for my scalp smells soooo good.
571 2018-05-11 22:34:56 What about nail oil AND drugs
572 2018-05-11 22:34:48 I took my car in for an oil change and I got a discount because I had my dog with me #goodboy
573 2018-05-11 22:34:38 Not only is Trump dragging us into another war, he is helping Putan  gain  more influence in the Middle East  and raising the price of oil which benefits Putan and harms Europe
574 2018-05-11 22:34:32 Follow the money. They plan to steal the oil.

577 2018-05-11 22:34:04 Drenched my body in cocoa butter oil (nightly ritual) and now my phone is so slippery 
578 2018-05-11 22:33:58 History...When they criticize the US it is partly due to the fact the CIA supported the Shah’s regime of repression to keep the oil flowing west, because the US supported Iraq’s Saddam in the war with their country and because they now see the US as an untrustworthy partner
579 2018-05-11 22:33:45 black seed oil is the truth I had a pimple on my forehead before work I put that s*** on I'm pulling up at my second gig now that pimple is gone

581 2018-05-11 22:33:15 I think I got oil on my dress 
582 2018-05-11 22:33:10 #RT @RealTimeWWII: British & French troops have occupied the islands of Aruba and Curaçao, in the Dutch Caribbean, to ensure oil installations there are not controlled by German invaders of Netherlands.
583 2018-05-11 22:33:07 About time grooming gangs were destroyed once and for all ,all this treading on egg shells around them is a nonsense ,time to put paid to them once and for all ,  if our elite mps or Lords have agreed to this happening ,  or as explained to me governments wanted cheaper oil

586 2018-05-11 22:31:53 Tar sands oil is conflict oil.  Ask the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation about the extra cancers they get.  Also, do you use oil?  Funny how you support the tar sands and use oil at the same time.
587 2018-05-11 22:31:50 Fuck sake I had baby oil too
588 2018-05-11 22:31:48 Give me coconut oil and your titties I'll show you the science
589 2018-05-11 22:31:43 @brysontiller the way you fell off you might discover oil.  You need to broke again so we can get that Trapsoul vibe.
590 2018-05-11 22:31:42 Cruel people will never be leaders, they will remain rulers till they die as cruelty and leadership are like water and oil, they don't mix
591 2018-05-11 22:31:37 I prefer castor oil over this 
592 2018-05-11 22:31:15 Before i wash my hair i detangle my hair with coconut oil and water ( sometimes i add a lil bit of moisturizer or conditioner depending on how tangled my hair is )and Section my hair into maybe 4-6 chunks . I’ll either let that soak in my hair under a shower cap while i chill or
593 2018-05-11 22:31:04 ...Chairman Bishop,seems to be inclined on old @GOP Gas or Oil deals for Puerto Rico,whereas Gov.

594 2018-05-11 22:31:04 Marinating in baby oil ... soaked in a bath... exfoliated vigorously... works for everyone else. WHY NOT ME.
595 2018-05-11 22:30:47 Definitely! I don't cook like fast food is made w/ lots of oil and grease, so my body isn't used to it. The only thing I won't regret what it does to my digestive system is a Garbage Plate. WELL worth the tummy problems later/next day

602 2018-05-11 22:29:30 "Ultimately, without Oil Search and their partners, its unclear where these land owners would get funding" Blumberg

sounds like 'be grateful you're getting anythingat all' dangerous attitude for a company relying on land owner good will
603 2018-05-11 22:29:20 I love the way peppermint oil feels on my scalp
604 2018-05-11 22:29:12 ahh right! well i’ve got quite short hair, so i’d just usually lather it in coconut oil before bleach and that seems to help a LOT
605 2018-05-11 22:29:09 I swear once coconut oil became a craze the quality went down, I hardly trust most brands of it now
606 2018-05-11 22:29:08 Les vergetures sa part hein ! Beurre de karite ou bi oil au pire
607 2018-05-11 22:29:08 Heard oil may go to 100 a barrel this summer..such b.s.

609 2018-05-11 22:28:56 Gasoline has gone up 45 cents a gallon in the last month.  I have oil heat as well with a 500 gallon oil  tank.   Groceries have gone up too.  Health care, the list goes on...we are paying attention!
610 2018-05-11 22:28:49 Me at 12pm: hmm my car shouldn’t be making that sound, lemme go get my oil changed and stuff 
Me at 630pm: broken down on the highway 

611 2018-05-11 22:28:48 Oh, I just brought up oil pastels since it's how I had the same experience. But yeah, sometimes learning can really blow dick for skittles...
612 2018-05-11 22:28:46 how are we supposed to use black seed oil ?

626 2018-05-11 22:27:04 That would be a great fact if it said how much oil was spilled. At least with a pipeline you can shut the flow off and contain the mess, if a train de-rails not only is most (if not all) of the oil going to spill, theres a much higher chance of it exploding and damaging wildlife
627 2018-05-11 22:26:57 *PLOT TWIST* It's not water, it's holy oil.

629 2018-05-11 22:26:48 Trump is bathing in oil to keep slippery. Considering he sells snake oil, this seems logical.
630 2018-05-11 22:26:26 (at some point, it would be good to have optical absorption spectra for essential oil constituents to know what colors they are -faintly-)

634 2018-05-11 22:25:17 Those tax cuts were awesome...for billionaires and Russians, oil is up $1 a gallon since trump took over...he gave the working class just enough of a tax cut to pay for the gas increase. Which means our tax cuts are going right back in the pockets of the billionaires,thanks trump
635 2018-05-11 22:25:13 Wall Street experts:

Oil will be “Lower for longer” for 
the foreseeable future. 


636 2018-05-11 22:24:58 You realize your oil industry will be annihilated by the conversion to EV right? Do you even know how little the market for oil there is outside energy?

641 2018-05-11 22:23:45 The exact same thing happened to me when I first used oil pastels. I learned the hard way it's a far different ball game than charcoal. I feel ya on that.
642 2018-05-11 22:23:28 Just thought of "burning that midnight CBD oil" and made myself laugh alone in my car

645 2018-05-11 22:23:15 It’s no ‘dirtier’ than reg oil.  It is higher molecular weight. With fewer light ends.  Otherwise oil is oil.

652 2018-05-11 22:21:48 No the US is not taking a big risk, the US already lost when they invaded Irak; their second Vietnam. It’s all based on corporate greed, weapon sales and oil.
653 2018-05-11 22:21:45 It is particularly disingenuous to blame WM for the lack of tax take in the last couple of years when it was the SNP at SG who begged WM for tax cuts to assist the oil and gas industry.

656 2018-05-11 22:21:26 A large percentage of people in S. Louisiana make their living in oilfield jobs. The lower prices caused lay-offs, cut hours, & decrease in wages. We are happy oil prices are starting to edge up. It’s been a tough for the last 3 - 4 years.
657 2018-05-11 22:21:10 Hi I have a question. I noticed your profile says you're for nutritional cannibus. Can you tell me if you think CBD oil is as benificial as edibles containing THC for pain? I'm new to this and it's still not legal here. If you have as thought on this that would be great! Tanks
658 2018-05-11 22:20:55 They provide those advantages to everyone, including those who can't afford those products. The buyers are a small group yes, but growing rapidly. 40% of new cars sold in my country are electric now. The future is coming. Now if we could only stop the oil subsidies...!
659 2018-05-11 22:20:50 Your comparisons with Norway aren't comparing like-for-like. Norways's oil fields are in easier waters, with lower extraction costs; and they have a newer infrastructure, and so lower maintenance costs. They also didn't beg for tax cuts—as SNP did to WM.
660 2018-05-11 22:20:37 I took two not great, but not awful New York steaks, put Salt, pepper and olive oil on them and scared them with a broiler for 3-4 mins a side at 4" from the heat, then proceeded to eat them with my daughter :)

674 2018-05-11 22:18:44 Scotland, with its well-endowed resources and manufacturing, is exporting to the value of £78.6bn (excluding oil& gas) to countries all over the world. Once you add the latest oil and gas figures – Scotland’s exports of oil and gas were worth £19.4bn s increased.
YOU YES YET?
675 2018-05-11 22:18:35 Syrian people have lots of friends here in US. Unfortunately, like so many nations around the world, US government does not represent the majority of the people. It represents arms manufacturers, Jewish lobby, Israel, desire to geopolitically dominate the globe, lust for oil . .
676 2018-05-11 22:18:24 Should have built a pipe line to NB

 you know a way to create jobs and lowerthe ridiculous gas prices build oil refineries in canada rather then losing money selling it to the us to be refined and buying it back at inflated costs
677 2018-05-11 22:18:13 If gas turbines are out of order than where is furnace oil electricity?? They are just providing electricity from gas turbine then why they charge electricity unit in oil price, are we fool?? Nab, nepra should investigate, ppp should take back KE
678 2018-05-11 22:18:08 Lol. Will use this next time I go for my oil change.
679 2018-05-11 22:18:08 @GameStop @gamestopcorp it doesnt take a rocket science to turn a profit on an oil field. #tech #news
I'd recommend 

Enter the E-sports market
Cut back on some retail locations
Set up some strategic partnerships with industry leaders
Possibly explore a subscription revenue model
680 2018-05-11 22:18:07 Add oil and gas business. 
Impoter/exporter

688 2018-05-11 22:17:13 You are pathetic, #TraitorTrump. I think you just did this to hike oil prices. Resign. #GOPcorruption #IranProtests
689 2018-05-11 22:17:10 Yes John McCain served and yes he's a POW, who was tortured.. but he does not deserve our respect. McCain is a MASSIVE WARHAWK who has had NO problem with sending kid after kid to DIE in a pointless illegal war for oil, risking them being captured and tortured! McCain! #tytlive
690 2018-05-11 22:17:08 Interesting this came out today.....lol

BREAKING: The U.S. will come remarkably close to #oil independence (on a *net* imports basis) next year, according to new @EIAgov forecast. EIA pegs U.S. net imports in 2019 at the lowest in ~60 years -- #OOTT #OPEC #shale #Permian

692 2018-05-11 22:16:46 Nice! Do you know the Methylglyoxal content? Manuka Honey is from NZ, from the Manuka Tree (same tree as Tea Tree oil) Having a UMF rating of at least 15 is important. I use 20+ which has an MG content over 95+mg (not all Manuka honey is created equal!) 
693 2018-05-11 22:16:36 went to get my oil changed by myself for the first time today and I didn’t even know how to pop my hood and the guy had to do it for me I’m a disgrace
694 2018-05-11 22:16:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, and a terrorism crisis.
695 2018-05-11 22:15:30 Honest to god all I want right now is a good Aztec clay mask to suck all the heresy, toxins, and oil out of my soul I mean skin today
696 2018-05-11 22:15:29 @realDonaldTrump  something needs to be done with this oil price. It's getting out of control again...
697 2018-05-11 22:15:17 Focaccia is delicious! I especially like my focaccia politicians with some sea salt and olive oil.

709 2018-05-11 22:12:39 Poignant. Condolences to the Wilson brood.  Will do a commemorative oil change this weekend, celebrating the impressively reliable and worthy life of their now-fallen machine.
710 2018-05-11 22:12:36 But you are Silent on the continued GENOCIDE of Biafra Jews and Christians in Nigeria your origin, so British govt and their jihadists can steal oil. Did you know MLK was killed 4 days before his visit to Biafra his origin?. We are watching .
711 2018-05-11 22:12:33 I would love to rub oil or sunscreen on you
712 2018-05-11 22:12:25 @CTVToronto Your stories on Gas prices and Dan McTeague are frustrating and misrepresentative. Saying the price of oil per barrel causes extreme prices?! So then why does the US gas price only go up 2cents PER GALLON?? We are being hosed - end of story
713 2018-05-11 22:12:18 Literally just the general “what oil does it run now” had me confused so.
714 2018-05-11 22:11:46 I think a lot of quinoa is now grown out of the Andes, so it’s not impacting the original indigenous growers. I also tend to avoid palm oil.
715 2018-05-11 22:11:24 everyone telling us to cover meself in baby  oil and shower it off to get rid of my fake tan... are they trying to sabotage and getting me to break me neck in the bath? its a fucking slip and slide

717 2018-05-11 22:11:06 7000 workers in New Plymouth rely on the oil and gas industry. Local National MP says govt changes will devastate the community. But @mangonui08 says he's never met anyone in Taranaki who's afraid of a ghost town future.  #nationnz

726 2018-05-11 22:10:25 It is due to the fact that they have shed themselves of any moral compass and have opted to sell themselves to the snake oil salesman and their russian handlers...for a few pieces of silver...may God have mercy on them because here on earth We should NOT!
727 2018-05-11 22:10:14 I do that with jojoba oil but still. Showering. Lotioning. All too much work. Where is my jestons shower of the future?

731 2018-05-11 22:09:54 They meant well as they poured oil & concrete over our earth until it looked like hell.
732 2018-05-11 22:09:50 You put coconut oil in the bath? Hadn’t heard of that. Good luck for 2ww.
733 2018-05-11 22:09:47 Oh we are SO far behind here it's not even funny.

Texas actually has a decent wind grid, but a terrible solar one, and Big Oil has lobbied hard for laws that sabotage anyone who wants rooftop panels.
734 2018-05-11 22:09:27 Slathered my body in coconut oil and shaved the whole thing smooth.

Then, I took a bath and oiled my body in coconut oil afterwards.

Now, I am just laying in bed with all this self love pouring out of me and onto my bed sheet.

737 2018-05-11 22:09:12 Got anyone neat facts about oil?
738 2018-05-11 22:09:01 Even in Putin’s tightly controlled crime syndicate which he refers to as mother  Russia the dissatisfaction is evident. When the economy is no longer propped up by oil then the people will start to rebel. And I don’t think Putin has the military behind him like some dictators.
739 2018-05-11 22:08:41 Desr Steve.....
It is due to the fact that they have shed themselves of any moral compass and have opted to sell themselves to the snake oil salesman and their russian handlers...for a few pieces of silver...may God have mercy on them because here on earth We should NOT!
740 2018-05-11 22:08:38 It’s very apparent in Cape Breton. I don’t see it in broad daylight in Alberta, sure some sketchy places in Edson or other oil towns but when a visitor sees it in Cape Breton with his own eyes, works with many of them (they all talk about) known many who have died, it’s a problem
741 2018-05-11 22:08:33 Yes, this definitely needs more fat (nuts & seeds, avocado, dairy with some fat, fatty fish, eggs, olive oil & butter, etc). I haven't looked at the Israeli guidelines yet, but if I had to compare this to the US DGA—this is more like what the recommendations were in 1980-1985.
742 2018-05-11 22:08:21 I really wanna show the new glow oil bottle. Im mad proud
743 2018-05-11 22:08:20 I’m on a train with the squeakiest breaks. Oil up this poor baby!
744 2018-05-11 22:08:18 Hey Sister. I’m in the same boat. Just had surgery for skin cancer a few weeks ago. They didn’t remove all the staples today, so I was bummed. We never used sun screen. Just “tanning oil” and I was a swimmer and lifeguard always in the sun. Paying the price now.
745 2018-05-11 22:08:10 @BILOSuperSaver what type of oil is used to cook your fried chicken?
746 2018-05-11 22:07:57 Why have a Watchdog , when the LIBERALS know it is happening on the Federal Liberals and the Ontario Liberal. Both parties cooking in the kitchen with the oil companies and they are not cooking french fries.Another 500 dollars a month to drive to make a living when gas goes up.
747 2018-05-11 22:07:49 I swear my pen be smoking itself. My oil just be on low outta no where 
748 2018-05-11 22:07:46 @Valvoline I went to an valvoline express care today for a standard oil change and my engine blew up less than a mile down the road BECAUSE MY OIL FILTER FELL OUT! Now my car is ruined and going cost thousands to repair the engine. I am contacting a lawyer.

752 2018-05-11 22:06:35 Cuba doesn’t have oil money
753 2018-05-11 22:06:32 So why is it that no Republicans have signed onto "The Marijuana Justice Act"? What's in it for them? You would think they had some under the table reason for that. Maybe good friends in the oil business. Cotton business buddies maybe. Pharma buddies!!! That's it!
754 2018-05-11 22:06:29 They tell you that you can fly, but only if you believe it with all your heart. When you find that you can't, they say it is all your fault ... because you just didn't believe hard enough. Brexit is nothing but snake oil.
755 2018-05-11 22:06:03 Does the Oil lobby cause oil spills off our coasts?  No.  Do they work hard to keep rigs being built and increasing the odds of a spill occurring? Yes.
The NRA has become the gun manufacturing lobby, and work hard to keep military weapons in the hands of civilians.
756 2018-05-11 22:06:00 There is 100s of fried chicken shops which are packed with students - not sure what oil, chicken they use - with a McD at least you are guaranteed- would be delighted if he closed half the Dixys, Chester’s, HFC- they are the real junk food

Bryngwran have now won an Anglesey cup double this season, after victory in the Lucas Oil Cup over the same opponents last month.

783 2018-05-11 22:02:18 i remember there was this one article or some tweet or something and it was like "man finds CURE to HIV". and i looked up the dude and he is literally just a modern snake oil salesman but instead of curing TB with like idk rat blood its curing autism with coconut oil lmao
784 2018-05-11 22:02:15 1st, it's none of your business what our @POTUS does.

2nd, he did the right thing for America & Americans. #AmericaFirst

3rd, Fance, Germany, & UK are the countries that brought Khomaini in power & created Islamic Republic of #Iran to steal Iran's oil, natural gas, & the rest.
785 2018-05-11 22:02:12 just found out where argan oil comes from 
786 2018-05-11 22:02:11 Partially, it’s also two pipelines to carry gas to Turkey though Syria, to cut off Gasprom’s deal with Europe. It has zero to do with nuclear anything. Iran is oil rich and right now they sell it to China and Russia, and this just won’t do for John Bolton

788 2018-05-11 22:02:03 What business is Jimboman running? He is showing real people how to make money without asking for any money in return. He has fun bantering and exposing frauds. And he is speaking the true gospel.....US oil production (something you're trying to create doubt about)!!!!!!
789 2018-05-11 22:02:00 Last night I made shrimp & grits with a fajita seasonings. Tonight I am making a sheet pan shrimp b(r)oil with homemade Old Bay. Just an East Coast gal living in the Midwest fucking up Southern tradition.

791 2018-05-11 22:01:38 Damn i put so much coconut oil and body shimmer but i just look like a gold wrapped milk chocolate bar
792 2018-05-11 22:01:23 POTUS 43 messed up big time with regime change in Iraq! He’s in no position to talk about generosity or morality, as he’s failed in international arena. He can certainly donate out of the Bush chest (attained from the war and oil machine), but not from the gov’t or you/me.
793 2018-05-11 22:01:22 These guys make the old man’s NEP look like grant to the oil sands. Investment, Shell Imperial Oil fleeing with haste. China is probably buying at Trudeau Sale prices.
794 2018-05-11 22:01:19 Srsly dude you need a new act. Pretty sure snake oil salesmen are out of style. Oh and BTW. There’s a fucking reason there is separation of church and state.
795 2018-05-11 22:01:18 
Tom Barrack hired Gates & Winston Wilcoff for the inauguration. He met Manafort 40 years ago in Beirut. Barrack became wealthy from Saudi Arabian oil. Vekselberg & Intrater (pd Cohen 4 consulting) started in oil & gas. The plot thickens.
796 2018-05-11 22:01:15 Lives so that debt down from stratospheric levels. Oil production is down the top.

808 2018-05-11 21:59:45 El poder judicial ya decretó la quiebra de Oil. La AFIP más lejos de cobrar. Ni C5N quiere el Gobierno que quede como voz opositora. No hay libertad de prensa.

The Elliott Wave forecast for crude oil prices show a mature up trend and that a significant portion of the previous two year up trend may be retrace...
810 2018-05-11 21:59:31 Before or after the 4 hour "eating" window, will caffeine, coffee, or MCT oil have a negative impact on the benefits of the time restricted eating?
811 2018-05-11 21:59:29 Yeah. But I have one for sale there now and MC needs more than the oil and gas industry! Kids don’t stay to raise families there anymore.
812 2018-05-11 21:59:17 Farmers voted for this 
813 2018-05-11 21:59:15 Every time I need an oil change I wanna cry. Walking into a garage is like walking into a barbershop.
814 2018-05-11 21:59:10 Warm soapy water or margarine or olive oil should break it down enough to rub off 
815 2018-05-11 21:58:52 I have gone thru this with a lot of elderly rescue cats.  It is sad.  Little soldiers, they let you know when they are ready to go.  Rescue remedy, lavendar are relaxing, maybe even some CBD oil. She has been out sunbathing a lot, I'm sure she delights in that.
816 2018-05-11 21:58:38 Shale oil & gas...
817 2018-05-11 21:58:37 I’m only fixing a few things that’s going wrong with ya car baby girl. Oil change, spark plugs, putting a new battery in, change that tire 
818 2018-05-11 21:58:36 Yup! The purple one has lavender essential oil. One of my favorite scents, even if people think lavender smells like old lady. haha 
819 2018-05-11 21:58:28 We have a classic and avocado oil version of our Fabanaise as well!
820 2018-05-11 21:58:28 There are also many high degree level nutritional experts. I respect BDA & AfN, but here are also high degree level Bant & ION Nutritionists. No they can’t diagnose in a Hospital setting, that doesn’t make them ALL snake oil sellers. There are good & bad in all professions.
821 2018-05-11 21:58:15 Before or after the 6 hour "eating" window, will caffeine, coffee, or MCT oil have a negative impact on the benefits of the diet regimen??
822 2018-05-11 21:58:10 With iran thing going on now, oil prices will go up again.
823 2018-05-11 21:58:09 Not hatred of oil. It is the need to address anthropic climate change.
824 2018-05-11 21:57:53 Great idea ! First start small doses and build up over two weeks. Make sure it's organic clean oil. 
825 2018-05-11 21:57:45 Pada akhirnya memang jadi tumis labu siam + sesame oil. Gurih. 
826 2018-05-11 21:57:38 @realDonaldTrump @gmc @GM @mtbarra  how often do you have to put oil in your vehicle! Oh I forgot rich people don't do that! I have to check mine often for fear of blowing up engine, because gmc will not repair even though still under warranty!

828 2018-05-11 21:57:01 Oh gotcha.. I was gonna say I would never Uber somewhere when it's such a short time it takes. I did Uber one time when I left the car at the shop but that was for major repairs taking several hours not just an oil change
829 2018-05-11 21:56:55 Olive oil?
830 2018-05-11 21:56:53 Yup, akhirnya jadi tumis (Nggak jadi noodle) labu siam pakai sesame oil. Enak ternyata pakai sesame oil, gurih. Semoga nanti nggak salah paham lagi  biar masaknya sesuai niat.

833 2018-05-11 21:56:17 I came into Firestone today and told them niggas up front, “I already know I got some other issues with my tire but I ain’t paying for nothin but this oil change bruh.”
834 2018-05-11 21:56:13 No tendría por qué. Al declarar la quiebra de la Oil no tiene que pagar la deuda, porque los activos pasan al Estado, y no la superan. Está preso, sin condena y con $ para pagar su "salida"
835 2018-05-11 21:56:10 I was supposed to do it at all but I got my oil changed and my emissions checked I’m proud of myself cuz I usually wait until the day before it expires
836 2018-05-11 21:56:03 The highway took part of our farm, the railway took part of our farm, now an oil company wants to build a road thru our homeplace.  A better road exists already.  
Please, how can we fight this???
837 2018-05-11 21:55:56 Uncle u are picking stuff from the air..how many oil and related companies made profit in 2017? There was and still is a slump in that industry worlwide...tell me about Dangote, Guinness And NBL..even in recession...they didn't make losses..pls don't say ALL

840 2018-05-11 21:55:27 What are you talking about,oil companies have been price fixing for years under the LIBERALS and you have let them because of your need for greed at the pumps. Any one elected should stop this blatant criminal price fixing across Canada , Ontarian .We don't need a Watchdog

856 2018-05-11 21:53:47 Iran,1 time Persia, doesn’t need nuclear power plan.Iran is2nd 2Saudi Arabia in production of oil.Barrel cost Iran $5.00 so can build diesel power plan. Also sun shine on the country 11.5 month x year, solar energy would be good.Iran wouldn’t even dream to start a war with USA

859 2018-05-11 21:53:35 We always have been. We're at their mercy in every way. Trump decides to stop playing nice and we are done. Especially since we can't get oil out to the overseas markets & continue to sell to the US at a discount. The expat Freeland is an utter idiot and will f-up the NAFTA deal.
860 2018-05-11 21:53:35 Have a friend coming over for dinner in a few minutes. I made my hasselback potatoes that are basted with a garlic, rosemary, and lemon olive oil, my mom made chicken, and our friend is bringing a garden salad. Oh, and we have steamed broccoli too! Yummy!

It's your season & they will testify.
864 2018-05-11 21:53:06 Compren oil combustibles, paguen los impuestos y den trabajo! Los d C5N critican a Macri porque al oferente le daban 12 cuotas para pagar los impuestos y no 96! Y la justicia la mando a la quiebra! Olvídate de pagar los impuestos otra vez!!
865 2018-05-11 21:52:43 Seeing weed prices in Oregon collapsing, some as low as $50/lb for flowers used primarily for oil. Over-production they say. I hear Seattle is in the same type of bind.
866 2018-05-11 21:52:42 Good luck man! Hammer down!
867 2018-05-11 21:52:16 So easy! Chop fennel bulb into wedges. Use canned artichoke hearts, drained and dried. Olive oil, salt, pepper, 425 oven, for about 15 min each side, depending on how carmelized you like. Finish with drizzled olive oil and lemon juice. Eat.
868 2018-05-11 21:52:07 @other98 Remember when @POTUS44 got the blame when gas prices increased? Now 45 directly caused higher oil prices and they’re all quiet bc stocks are up n their pockets are getting fatter. It’s all about the 
869 2018-05-11 21:52:05 U sound like u own stock in the oil sands or KM. I'm in b.c. we remember Exxon. We know more than u understand. We also stand to loose many jobs and property values if KM was to ever leak. It is more the toxins in the oil. We have so many people that rely on habitat for a job.
870 2018-05-11 21:52:02 You live in Edinburgh! Surely this isn't your first mouse! Almost all old tenements have a mouse at some point, esp if there is remodeling going on. I second the peppermint oil! Put a couple of drops in a spray bottle around your skirting boards and no more mice!

872 2018-05-11 21:51:57 The rothchild has that land, it’s filled with natural gas/oil resources. You need to kill them to get it back otherwise the greed for that rich land won’t be returned.
873 2018-05-11 21:51:34 Can’t wait til we get these oil barons, fund managers and CEOs out the paint too. That would be some revolutionary shit.
874 2018-05-11 21:51:32 I’m just waiting on my boss to call and say, “well there’s a tiny oil spill downtown. Can you go out and do it?” I’m sure the whole company is waiting on this call right now.
875 2018-05-11 21:51:30 @BryanatLogic You should put something up about when that oil guy closed his fund which marked a massive turning point UP in oil
876 2018-05-11 21:51:28 Planes? They were drones of the day. They could detect movement of aircraft on fields over 400 miles away. Israel was incensed, and they were one of our main allies. It was thought to be a main reason for destabilization of the Middle East. All it was was money for oil resources.
877 2018-05-11 21:51:15 i just woke up to do stuff but im not feeling like that so im gonna go to sleep. I just put some oil in my hair
878 2018-05-11 21:50:57 Yeah. I think you better check the user of the word slaves. Kanye was talking about literal slaves during the time of slavery.

Also thanks for revealing yourself to be a stereotyping bigot. Plenty of white people on gov't assistance too, not to mention oil companies etc
879 2018-05-11 21:50:56 Unfortunately I’m stuck in hospital right now so will most likely have to raincheck, BUT I’m thinking we’ll hit up The Good Oil when I’m a bit better 
880 2018-05-11 21:50:54 In the WH, ppl think that the oil Saudi Arabia exports to the USA should cost less for US Americans than what Saudi citizens pay at home.
881 2018-05-11 21:50:52 And the spike in oil prices after the Iran announcement helped too. So the object isn’t to lower drug prices, it’s to pump the stock market. Interesting priority. The drug price thing was among the few campaign proposals from him that I liked. Has reneged on all.
882 2018-05-11 21:50:47 おはよーです！
883 2018-05-11 21:50:21 I think we should pour some oil over them !!
884 2018-05-11 21:50:19 Because there’s totally a practical way to live life and not use a single drop of oil. You can still use oil and be mad at the oil companies for constantly lying and hurting the environment more than necessary. Saying otherwise is the tu quoque fallacy.

893 2018-05-11 21:48:49 I taught myself to solder, fixed a microwave oven, repaired a faulty oil heater, built a desk for my office and am currently learning to code and do data analysis in R.  The internet is a wonderful source of info.

933 2018-05-11 21:43:32 Noticed how the price of oil is going up and the value of the ruble is suddenly increasing?  All since Trump violated the Iran agreement. Putin wanted their oil and cut a deal with the Saudis right after Trump went there and got that golden parade welcome. 1/2

935 2018-05-11 21:43:17 Makes absolutely no sense. We don’t use Iranian oil. We have our OWN oil. The traders are screwing the consumer once again based on nothing. Supply and demand has nothing to do with it.

940 2018-05-11 21:42:51 I use Bio Oil I really like it 
941 2018-05-11 21:42:51 They buy brand new jets...and they phase out older ones in the fleet...zim just bought 12 year old ones...Emirates is backed by oil money ...it can buy any jet it wants...their customer service is top notch.
942 2018-05-11 21:42:47 We need some help trying, my goodness, back in the 70's they were saying become energy independent, get off foreign oil, we've not tried to do it, would should be the leaders of renewables, not standing idle allowing China to take the lead like we did, while in Iraq while they ..
943 2018-05-11 21:42:19 Taxes are through the roof.

We just got more gas taxes. Property taxes went up again. 

Oil industry in central CA is all but extinct.

Roads and infrastructure are crap

50k homeless in the state.

But hey. Tout the success of Google and the like
944 2018-05-11 21:42:14 Per a few CM’s ... apparently the fire earlier the Magic Kingdom was caused by an oil leak. Still haven’t heard if the operator and performers were all ok yet.
945 2018-05-11 21:42:13 There are a few. I would say Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris have both risen to their positions in fairly short periods of time. Warren has been in office less than 5 years. Harris less than 2. Pomeo went to congress 8 years ago after being a Koch-backed oil tycoon.

947 2018-05-11 21:41:47 je lave mon visage avec du savon noir d’afrique (vraiment je conseille à 1000% mais il faut qu’il soit brut), et je mets de l’huile d’églantier (??? rosehip oil) après ma crème le soir, le lendemain ton visage glow et ça enlevez les cicatrices

953 2018-05-11 21:41:15 So I straightened my hair after like 150 years, then sprayed too much hair oil in my hair. Now it’s ruined and I’m upset
954 2018-05-11 21:40:59 Is all you have to do was give trump 200 thousand dollars you could be in his back pocket and then you can do whatever you want skyrocket medication run the oil wells in the Everglades Pollute all that fresh water take all the state parks Drill for oil Car companies giving trump

956 2018-05-11 21:40:48 2 and a half hours later I was on my way back to Jersey. I got lost in a thunderstorm and it was well past one in the morning when I got in. I didn't have keys so my aunt and uncle left the back door unlocked. I had a text from someone I'd met at the fake frat. A girl.
957 2018-05-11 21:40:48 Drill, baby, drill. Gas prices under control as well as many other commodities bc production costs go down. Also, lower oil prices reduced terrorism funding and Russian military expansionism
958 2018-05-11 21:40:47 I swear by Syrian olive oil soap. Some sort of ancient recipe. Just signed up on her website.
959 2018-05-11 21:40:34 You do. So I will announce (every day from now on) that @Big_Orrin has a suspicious Russian IP, and that he is a troll, probably paid for by a certain interests that want to discredit the increase in US oil production #WTI #OOTT #Oil #CrudeOil #Brent #OPEC #CL_F
960 2018-05-11 21:40:32 Hot water irritates hives. Shower in cool or cold water and peppermint oil helps me with the itching. I bought a little bottle from publix in the baking aisle
961 2018-05-11 21:40:30 And now that we are driving up oil prices with the Iran deal withdrawal, Russian will have even more cash to do their dirty work.  Thanks, Trump.

964 2018-05-11 21:40:20 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

966 2018-05-11 21:40:12 They are not generating Electricity from furnace oil, then why does they ask oil rate on electricity bill?? Nepra should take immediate action, chief minister sb ask nepra to investigate and take action, mem Mariam kindly do something
967 2018-05-11 21:40:10 Let’s play!
My head lacks no oil! 
My future shines brighter than my head tho

975 2018-05-11 21:39:07 Went to Walgreens for some cooking oil. They didn’t have any. I feel like that item just barely got cut from the team. Cooking oil is what separates the Walgreens from the Walmarts.
976 2018-05-11 21:38:48 What are Dems going to even run on in 2020??

Mr Mueller finds Trump received payments from Russia to stop Iran from exporting oil, causing skyrocketing gas prices, laundered Russian money for decades, and colluded with Russians to defraud our election.  His base won’t care!
977 2018-05-11 21:38:47 Good evening John @jwripple The oil painting for Bolton Bridge was a piece from Walter Steggles's later life but he worked from the pencil sketch which was "in period" from the 30's. He & Harold travelled with the family up to Edinburgh in c.1936 & I guess they stopped "en route"
978 2018-05-11 21:38:33 You tell your Armenian mother you’re eating healthy, she’ll make pasta the next day and say “I used olive oil NO butter” 
979 2018-05-11 21:38:31 @CleverTitleTK What we did in the past does matter.  Who built the roads, who fought the wars, who invented the cotton gin, who discovered oil, who constructed the RRs, the Panama Canal?  Problem today is the current gen has no discipline or will to work or fight what's wrong.
980 2018-05-11 21:38:16 ikr hahah tbh kita tak which one works the most sebab kita guna bnyk sngat products yg boleh reduce scars at the same time  buttt i think its the acids and kiehls midnight recovery tu and now kita tengah guna bio oil tapi dia lambat sikit la
981 2018-05-11 21:38:14 He was as much of a character as anyone I'd met. During each interview, I would ask the current player if they knew anything about the other people I'd spoken to. Just about everyone had a Creighton story. He was just that kind of guy.
982 2018-05-11 21:37:52 @PalmersUK  oil body lotion is amazing! The best body lotion I have ever used in my whole life. I have found ‘the one’

984 2018-05-11 21:37:17 He is just Harper Lite.     All of the same ilk, bought and paid for by big oil.

990 2018-05-11 21:36:48 So much sh** to clean up on twitter, but at least now we can identify the trolls!
991 2018-05-11 21:36:40 I have done a air tour over the oil sands in the Mac. It is toxic.
992 2018-05-11 21:36:35 CDB oil and topical on the joints - winding down with hunting shows. Night y’all :)
993 2018-05-11 21:36:33 Creighton agreed to meet with me about a week after I got in touch with him. He wanted to watch some March Madness games or something. It gave me extra time to prepare. The day of I got to his office early and drank a cider at the bar next door while reviewing my notes.
994 2018-05-11 21:36:30 Get some tea tree oil for it.
995 2018-05-11 21:36:10 For fucksake I tried that trick that’s going round about putting baby oil on to get fake tan off.. it hasn’t come off in the shower and now I’m going to have to go to work feeling like a bloody condom
996 2018-05-11 21:36:07 Why are you looking for more crude oil when you can't refine what you've got?!!! Crazy country
997 2018-05-11 21:36:05 Boil them for 5 minutes. Cut red onions into crescents. Oil in pan. Onions. Pierogies. Add butter. Let them sit for 5 minutes. Flip them over. Let them sit for 5 minutes. Serve w sour cream and applesauce.
998 2018-05-11 21:35:43 Invest in established non-selective state schools who have years of data to help make informed decisions about what best fits their communities. Anything else is snake oil.
999 2018-05-11 21:35:23 I want oil money
1000 2018-05-11 21:35:07 "Get randos out of your mentions with just a stethoscope, six barrels of crude oil and a waterlogged wire coathanger? You're crazy."
1001 2018-05-11 21:35:05 Naa, olive oil 
1002 2018-05-11 21:34:54 ねーむい
1003 2018-05-11 21:34:41 This whiskey they've brought looks like overused Oil but anyway
1004 2018-05-11 21:34:37 U sweet lol all they say go in one ear and out, I didn’t come hea for none but a oil change
1005 2018-05-11 21:34:34 No they don't the government violates treaties to allow strip mining, drilling for oil.  If you lived on red. and oil was found they appointed white men to control the Indians money.  Many were murdered for oil money.
1006 2018-05-11 21:34:33 If he wants that wall so badly, and gets it built, he’ll be building another one due North along the parallel line- We Canadians hate such acts, and will block you out.

Of course, you don’t care... until we stop sending you our oil and raw materials, so you can make money.
1007 2018-05-11 21:34:32 Well, empty thoughts of the day. I voted against Obama, mr brilliant. And he didn't take us to war. But his foreign policy is why. And Trump hasn't shown any signs of peace. Likely Russia that give NK 3 loads of oil against sanctions is probably being paid to be nice to Trump.
1008 2018-05-11 21:34:26 Rising Fuel Prices by the Big Oil Industry are gouging the American consumers daily, using every reason imaginable for their actions to raise costs w/No oversight.
Lib Politicians have bowed down to Big Oil long enough for campaign financing/perks while Americans paying the price
1009 2018-05-11 21:34:14 Ending offshore oil and gas exploration is the proper process.
1010 2018-05-11 21:34:02 Who won??
1011 2018-05-11 21:33:57 1 De Rica oil dey your head broda 
1012 2018-05-11 21:33:53 He's also working for the Saudis. Why else would he and admin have met with them. He needed their support on Iran and Syria so it was a bargaining point since the Saudis have been hurting with the low oil prices. 
Gas, Saudis, Iran, Syria, trump, oil-- it's all tied together!
1013 2018-05-11 21:33:50 Getting my oil changed and the guy goes “are you aware of the nail in your tire” I responded “OH MY GOD” really loud and he laughed at me and said “I take that as a no” 

Why am I like this
1014 2018-05-11 21:33:33 Then I gotta buy the oil and the filter, replace it myself take the old oil and drop it off somewhere cause that shit gotta get disposed properly. Lmao shit sound like so much work
1015 2018-05-11 21:33:26 For the record...I’ve never been into Fish oil bother. I’m 99 percent vegan except for the honeys ;-)
1016 2018-05-11 21:33:21 I feel like I should be on a beach w one man feeding me grapes while another one fans me and the hot one fetching me a drank and rubbing tanning oil on me
1017 2018-05-11 21:33:15 I like fresh air. I also like good gas mileage. I don’t like oil companies whining that oil prices are too low. I remember diesel at the pump @ $4.39. I don’t like that either. The auto and oil companies need to stop whining about emissions standards. I would like that. You?
1018 2018-05-11 21:33:08 Holding that aceTrump is using Putin’s tricks on USA. This’s a Criminal Conspiracy Largest ever seen in the USA. Watch the dollar and oil. Octopus tentacles all over the world. Russia the impetus. World domination. USA on its knees. It’s working. Trump the carnival barker.
1019 2018-05-11 21:32:39 I been at Walmart since 12 getting my oil changed

1023 2018-05-11 21:32:09 So the TRUTH comes out.   The IRAN deal is all about EU businesses wanting the OIL and Banking business in IRAN.  They don't care about a NUC,  America will have to deal with that
1024 2018-05-11 21:32:05 Why are people concerned about peanut butter oil?

1027 2018-05-11 21:31:38 Look at whatever you buy and if it contains Palm oil take a pass unless you like killing babies and mamas.
1028 2018-05-11 21:31:27 popularized use of palm oil ingredient increases destruction of rare tropical forests.
the wood is very valuable (affordable furniture isn't wood anymore, it's mostly saw dust glued together and that saves forests)
and the forests/jungles are replaced with palm trees for industry
1029 2018-05-11 21:31:14 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
1030 2018-05-11 21:31:07 LOL. That was why the Iran deal was quashed, to increase the price of oil which increases the price of gasoline at the pump. RT was crowing about it and thanking DJT for getting it done. Russian economy needed a boost!
1031 2018-05-11 21:31:04 @RepCharlieDent 
Why are regulations on air, oil, banking onerous but regulating every fertile uterus is okay?What ruined our
economy was deregulation!Have you learned nothing?
GOP never invested in middleAmerica! Trickledown
doesn’t work, look at Kansas! GOP tax bill was a Joke!
1032 2018-05-11 21:31:03 Like a "effing" amount of wind and solar in Germany, Netherlands, Belgium etc. ?
And when we don't have got wind (a couple of weeks per year) we could use your electricity.
And the oil you are currently producing can be replaced by electrical cars (which is happening in Norway).
1033 2018-05-11 21:31:03 Ugh sadly I reckon it is way more than you think, tis a shame, as I love the Chemical Plant and Oil Ocean mixes
1034 2018-05-11 21:30:48 I had two imaginary friends: Oil and Nail Polish. 
1035 2018-05-11 21:30:45 I see you’ve moved on from “tut tut, Mr. Trump sir” to “actually bribery, graft and light fascism are good!” As per the official @NRO Playbook (c)1955
1036 2018-05-11 21:30:40 Volume of cenovus , cenovous hedging  programme and current oil price. This year cenovous is dead horse.
1037 2018-05-11 21:30:35 Disclaimer... I grew up in Alaska. Soldontna is a small town in AK. I left before Palin was Governor but I all but voted for her in 08. McCain, IMO, hamstrung her then let the MSM do what they may with her. Remember she won against Bush/Chenneys Big Oil friends/corruption in AK.
1038 2018-05-11 21:30:30 And this is relevant because tacos aren’t made of motor oil, right?
1039 2018-05-11 21:30:30 a black horse; and he who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand. And I heard something like a voice in the center of the four living creatures saying, “A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; but do not damage the oil and the wine.

1043 2018-05-11 21:30:06 Probably Uber and Lyft instead of oil prices.
1044 2018-05-11 21:30:01 Every time I get my oil changed they tell me I need a million other things done 
1045 2018-05-11 21:29:53 During a conversation w/another reporter today: "Hmmmm - what other woke oil companies can you think of?"
1046 2018-05-11 21:29:51 Dear leavers, if you want to do something for your children/grandchildren. Reduce your plastic use, stop using palm oil, aim for zero waste, go vegetarian or even better, vegan, cycle to work, use public transport, get an electric car, basically reduce your impact on the planet.
1047 2018-05-11 21:29:49 Y seria uno de los oferentes de Oil Combustibles? Que robo descarado, comenzo la "privatizacion"????

1051 2018-05-11 21:29:26 If it has Honey in it, or eggs, dairy, olives& olive oil don't consume.
1052 2018-05-11 21:29:11 What to use in Lieu of Pesticides? Neem Oil, Garlic & Clove Oil, Azatrol, StrawFlower Extract... the list goes on!
1053 2018-05-11 21:29:11 Oh for goodness sake!!! Gore's with the minority again! Will he ever learn??? It's your attitude and business dealings which are truly dirty. Think about that! Oh, oil from the Williston Basin in the USA is not dirty, right? VP of Hypocrisy!
1054 2018-05-11 21:28:19 guess ima try drinking castor oil to see if it helps get Lexine out by this weekend
1055 2018-05-11 21:28:13 Vegan cheese seems to all be coconut oil based and coconut oil triggers my eczema.
1056 2018-05-11 21:28:12 this picture looks like a "great masters" oil painting!
1057 2018-05-11 21:28:06 That day, clouds slunk into the tree-line like panned oil, earlobes of wisp forming, then unforming, caught by the dark horizon, a blueness palely raked--a wellspring of shadows.
1058 2018-05-11 21:27:56 I use coconut oil as lotion so you cant fucking talk to me that way

1062 2018-05-11 21:27:14 Oil is big business my dude
1063 2018-05-11 21:27:12 No one has oil anymore

1064 2018-05-11 21:27:00 Norway produces power to more than 100 million people. Most of it through oil and gas and enough Hydro power for maybe 6-7 million people. So even going full Hydro will leave some 80 millions without. Unless it's replaced with something else.
1065 2018-05-11 21:26:40 Try Lancaster skin oil, you can find it in Amazon, it might cost about $300-400, but its very effective..
1066 2018-05-11 21:26:37 Then it can suffer the consequences. Reversing course would be a huge mistake. Not just opinion, btw, gossip is that the big oil sands companies are worried a Trump-style rollback will happen.
1067 2018-05-11 21:26:34 HATE coming for an oil change :/ someone pick me up & i’ll buy u food pls

1069 2018-05-11 21:26:26 Return if you can! Using 2 quarts of oil I between oil changes acceptable to gmc!
1070 2018-05-11 21:26:23 yeah if it hurts that usually means you stretch too fast but if it's the first step then yeah it will hurt a bit ;3; don't be afraid to let 2 months between each stretch and once it will not hurt anymore, use jojoba oil on your ears and massage them to help :D
1071 2018-05-11 21:26:22 @guarnaschelli How do I get a "screamin' hot pan" and not burn the oil before the meat hits it??

1073 2018-05-11 21:26:10 I'm in the lobby of a Jiffy Lube getting my car's oil changed, and they're playing some sort of robot fighting show on the TV and it seems really metal. I have this sneaking suspicion that everyone here secretly wants to look up and watch it but everyone must be too embarrassed.
1074 2018-05-11 21:26:00 Historically, oil prices usually go higher at this time of year and level off in early June (I trade oil futures). Mideast tensions may prevent that stabilization currently, however.
1075 2018-05-11 21:26:00 #Gore, #Suzuki, #Mann, #Hayhoe, et al are only interested in lining their own pockets with my money. #Horgan is a huckster too. He puts himself first, not #Canada. #Alberta's #oil sand (not tar sands) is a convenient, easy target in a friendly western country.
1076 2018-05-11 21:25:37 a family member has tried peanut butter on flypaper/sticky paper before, taken it to a field and then dumped cooking oil on it so it can free itself, but that depends on whether you want to be anywhere near it!
1077 2018-05-11 21:25:32 Curious about links of Valerie Jarrett (and her dad, for whom BO's mom apparently worked for in Indonesia), and BOs apparent shift of sympathies to Iran.  Was this only about controlling oil supplies of  Iran, Russia, Venezuela, Ukraine while making U.S., west more dependent?
1078 2018-05-11 21:25:19 animal fats & fruit oils (extra-virgin oil olive & avocado oil) are good.

1080 2018-05-11 21:25:06 Only a complete idiot would confuse tar which is a coal byproduct, with oil from our oil sands. The mucky mess created by the oil sands is being cleaned up and replaced with clean soil and plants. If this is seen as a bad thing, then it says more about you than you may realize.
1081 2018-05-11 21:24:58 Remember that time I asked u to boil me an egg and I came downstairs to u pouring cooking oil over a raw egg in a frying pan over the hob
1082 2018-05-11 21:24:57 Oil Ocean is gone as well ;___;
1083 2018-05-11 21:24:56 On the bright side, he is making a barrel of oil worth maybe $100 in the near future. There goes all our tax breaks.

1087 2018-05-11 21:24:46 Aveeno moisturizing oil. The only thing I’ve found. The pink label one
1088 2018-05-11 21:24:45 watching the dweebus who lives in my building come home from his office job and pop the hood of his car and attempt to check the oil level of his car in a clean white shirt and he def has no idea what he's doing more at 8
1089 2018-05-11 21:24:27 El tema Oil y la quiebra con continuidad?.....por donde...lo informa
1090 2018-05-11 21:23:59 hey. other similar organic substances extracted in a non-chemical way can be called that too. like coconut oil, which can be extra virgin too.
1091 2018-05-11 21:23:33 Olohun  I was thinking he was just going to say the normal things we used to hear but I was amazed when he stated talking about oil price during gej admin and now and how it affected Buhari so greatly at first. Guy na real mvp walahi.
1092 2018-05-11 21:23:25 The UK and EU are fully committed to Iran deal,the US ca  scram for all we care.The US don'trun our world what the hell do they mean by sanctions?businesses should not trade in dollars,oil should not be traded in dollars, any fines to company should go to the home country not US
1093 2018-05-11 21:23:22 I need to do an oil change on my car, I’ve been slacking

1102 2018-05-11 21:22:45 I’m just going to sit at home... and whoever shows up is a real one because I’m not about to keep running through oil changes for y’all 
1103 2018-05-11 21:22:35 Uh oh - us SI Museum folks think we gave you the wrong paint. If it is smelly it is oil paint- and needs terpenoids to use. Not a good choice for man or cat in a hotel room.
You need acrylics. Sorry.
1104 2018-05-11 21:22:06 Im gunna take cod liver oil daily for a while and see how I'm feeling in a month or so, taste nasty, instant heave but I heard you can rub it into your skin? I did both anyway but not pleasant to taste at all. Is it really that beneficial to put myself through that taste?
1105 2018-05-11 21:22:04 Brush the oven to a low heat with a dollop of hot oil.
1106 2018-05-11 21:22:02 Who else sits next to a fan for a good 15-20 mins after doing their night time skin care?  because you don't want oil on your pillow.

1111 2018-05-11 21:20:58 I hate coconut oil sometimes but it makes me so pretty 
1112 2018-05-11 21:20:53 Well, was it any different during the madness of Oil City in the 19th century...?  Some businesses have non-linear payouts and they often leave a trail of carnage before a monopoly/monopsony is born.
1113 2018-05-11 21:20:50 Those trucks are way too expensive. I live in oil country Texas and know people who work or have worked in gas/oil. A lot of them have degrees believe it or not. The educated are in general better off than uneducated by many measures. Do some research.
1114 2018-05-11 21:20:49 Looking for an oil change? Steer clear of the #HavolineXpressLube in Lawrenceville, GA. Guy tried to charge me an extra $7 for a 6th quart of oil even though my vehicle only holds 4.5 and an extra $10 for a "special" oil filter. He can try that on the next man. #crooks

1121 2018-05-11 21:19:53 But (especially when Norway runs out of oil) you can use this a a "battery" for Northern Europe.
Mode 1: When windy import electricity and leave the uphill reservoir full.
Mode 2: When not windy use this for both Norway and export this.
And when the sun shines go to mode 1.
1122 2018-05-11 21:19:51 Try UV AVO, it’s oil free, medicated and around Rs. 250.
1123 2018-05-11 21:19:38 Leo que hay conocedores de la verdad que sostienen que a Oil la hicieron quebrar para que tambien se caiga Indalo, y con eso, @C5N salga del aire.

1126 2018-05-11 21:19:33 If you ask what American people got from the war, nothing but destructions. Nearly 5000 American men and women soldiers died in #Iraq for the benefit of US and UK oil corporations.
1127 2018-05-11 21:19:25 If it’s not oil trading’s biggest Loser. The sad part is your insults are like a child ‘s trying to attract attention. I find it really funny how much you want the attention and admiration of the people on OOTT. Nobody takes you seriously.

1129 2018-05-11 21:19:20 Actually, We don't, but you are welcome to go protest in Beijing, who produce 30% of global CO2, or Riyadh, who export most of the world's oil. At 1.6% of global CO2, with 9% of the global forests, Canada is actually carbon negative. Good luck with that. We are not the problem.
1130 2018-05-11 21:19:11 bored & hungry while i wait for my car to finish getting an oil change
1131 2018-05-11 21:19:06 Can we impeach @realDonaldTrump already? Just paid 2x as much for a tank of gas bc he wants to pull out of Iran deal to justify oil companies raising prices for more profit
1132 2018-05-11 21:19:05 Those other bottoms were at recessions. Consumer credit is 50% higher now than in 08 & inv are  bidding up retail stocks like it's Christmas.  WS seems to believe there is no end to a broken consumers willingness to spend even as ramuch es/oil soar. What am I missing.

1152 2018-05-11 21:16:40 Oh, I see. Novartis gets to keep the indecent profits it bribed you for, and you authorize other companies to rip consumers off with generics that are no better than snake oil.

Then before she had a chance to answer, he should have fired her.

1157 2018-05-11 21:16:03 I commission oil paintings and people usually give me a picture of the person they want the painting to be made of, usually on a specific pose or something and I paint it, in the term of prices usually 90 for a 8"x10" and 120 for a 12"x16"
1158 2018-05-11 21:15:51 I wonder why you guys pretend to dodge the truth, as at 2014,Oil Price stood at $100 and in 2017 Presently stands at $70, should they add their wages to increase GDP per Capita?

1163 2018-05-11 21:15:06 @TireDiscounters 2 hours for an oil change/tire rotation with a scheduled appointment and quote of a hour tops is pretty ridiculous
1164 2018-05-11 21:14:56 5..Banks will restart US Dollar Card issuance....

In summary, Nigeria will look at this windfall as permanent and spend as if oil will remain at $75....in fact watch we amend the budget or issue a supplemental budget.

Nigeria never learns...

1182 2018-05-11 21:13:00 We had a pizza from Blue Apron that had roasted cauliflower, golden raisins, and oregano with fresh mozzarella and it was super tasty! It used a red sauce but I imagine it’d be good with a white or garlic/olive oil sauce too!
1183 2018-05-11 21:12:45 The #oil price is still above the $70 mark. The #WTI closed at $70.70 today.
1184 2018-05-11 21:12:42 Oil dipped below the three-and-a-half year high of $78, reached on Thursday, as analysts suggested countries such as Kuwait and Iraq could step in to plug a potential fall in exports from Iran. Brent crude is currently down 0.2% at $77.34 a barrel.
1185 2018-05-11 21:12:40 $2.63 per gallon, nationwide: 2cents, $2.84... El Paso is the most expensive at $2.95... San Antonio and Sherman- Dennison area is the cheapest at $2.53... crude oil prices rose as US reunited sanctions on Iran this week...
1186 2018-05-11 21:12:38 No one. No one. Would watch this snake oil salesman’s show. I can think of far better ways to spend 60 minutes. Like pull out all my eyelashes and fingernails. #avenatti #nonads

1195 2018-05-11 21:11:27 That's so much bs it's laughable. There are 1000s and 1000s less jobs in oil than their was before the price crash. They won't be replaced. Oil is only 7% of Cda's entire GDP. What scam is being perpetrated on Cdns! #InTheNationalInterest

1197 2018-05-11 21:11:07 A wok + sesame oil + flash fry + a little soy sauce when I add the softer vegetables in. I also like to mix the rice in when it's almost done bc it adds more moisture to the vegetables which cooks them to completion and adds seasoning to the rice :)

1199 2018-05-11 21:10:54 the smell of olive oil is more comforting the arms of any man

1201 2018-05-11 21:10:26 Strong ain't the word for oil industry, more like super hero strength. Oil Prod Tax up 51.5% compared to 9.8% in CRE. Natural gas up 45.5% compared to CRE est = -9.5%. Are these guys on steroids or just fracking around? #txlege

1206 2018-05-11 21:10:04 There is an oil company in Nigeria named ‘Con’
1207 2018-05-11 21:10:01 This is not only issue with terrains! Also use a lot of oil and will not fix even though still under warranty!
1208 2018-05-11 21:09:58 I've driven an HST. To be honest it wasn't that special and the cab wreaked of fuel and oil.

1212 2018-05-11 21:09:17 b12 is more common amongst meateaters now according to a swedish study, it's also a sign of the times, not of the diet itself
oil using vegans should watch their omega3, vitaminD is something you should get from the sun, animal products have insignificant amounts of it to rely on
1213 2018-05-11 21:09:13 "I have rights you know! Do you have a warrant?"

No, lady. You got this all wrong. We're oil & gas executives.
1214 2018-05-11 21:09:10 Definitely! One can understand hunting them two centuries ago, when things were scarcer and a huge piece of meat & oil were so tempting, but there’s no excuse at all today.
1215 2018-05-11 21:09:10 Re BREXIT: Guess Independence for Scotland will soon be raised again But given that in 2014 @ the Referendum it couldn't afford the costs of winning with oil at $99 per barrel how could it now or at anytime in the near future with oil at $66 per barrel @IainDale @Iromg
1216 2018-05-11 21:09:07  yes motor oil some old people stuff but I use coconut oil on my natural and it’s GOOD
1217 2018-05-11 21:09:05 If your fluency in the English language is any indication of your cognitive abilities, I am tempted to conclude you perhaps have inhaled more oil fumes than most.

I just found out you have Palm oil in your lovely hazelnut spread. I love it but can’t buy it anymore due to deforestation and orangutans losing habitat rapidly. Sorry but this must stop. Please find another ingredient to use.
Thankyou
1220 2018-05-11 21:08:28 Just oil am well.. So e go look like today's puff puff

1223 2018-05-11 21:08:16 I know I’m just fucking around. I didn’t even know if it was gone or not. I heard Whoopi ranting about it while I was getting an oil change so I figured I’d toss a tweet in the ring
1224 2018-05-11 21:08:06 Mitchie, you're a lying sack of  and so is POTUS. You're both bought and paid for by big pharma, big oil, etc., etc.  You & @GOP are #Complicit with corrupt and treasonous Trump. New bumper sticker: NEVER VOTE REPUBLICAN.
1225 2018-05-11 21:07:44 No. But our fair share of oil lease royalties, and a stiff pay cut for our legislators would be a lovely start.

1238 2018-05-11 21:06:28 The benchmark US equity index rose 2.4 per cent over the five-day period. Much of that gain came from the energy sector as the prospect of renewed sanctions on Iran heightened concern over tightening supply and helped drive oil prices to their highest since late 2014. FT
1239 2018-05-11 21:06:18 Can you imagine a vegan reality show? You put in one of those anti-capitalists, meat eater apologist vegans in with a vegan that doesn’t eat soy or palm oil, in with a vegan who doesn’t shower, in with a black vegan who makes their food “too spicy” and you’ve got yourself a hit.

1264 2018-05-11 21:03:11 I'm conflicted, to be honest. I am not a potato. But I wouldn't object if you boiled me in oil.
1265 2018-05-11 21:02:55 Go to hell gore. You just want Canadian oil at a discount
1266 2018-05-11 21:02:51 It is important that the communities from which oil is gotten  be taken care of
1267 2018-05-11 21:02:41 I think they do, not as much though. It just comes through a polished corporate filter usually. Like ads from big oil about being “sustainable”. Not sure if it’s because we’re a decentralized mess of individuals or what. But why do things like #thankafarmer need to be a thing?

1271 2018-05-11 21:02:27 To help customers make informed choices, we require own brand products containing palm oil to clearly state ‘palm oil’ in the list of ingredients instead of a more generic ‘vegetable oil’ description." -I hope this helps with your query Tony! -Kat
1272 2018-05-11 21:02:26 you get plenty of omega 3 as a vegan if you don't use oil
kind of like how elephants don't need fish/meat for omega3 either despite having bigger brains than humans
our evolution was not from what we ate, but how we lived
1273 2018-05-11 21:02:23 Dirty tar sands oil eh? Maybe we should have left it naturally seeping into the lakes, rivers and water table in that area. Would a nice black oil slick make you feel better because it's a natural occurrence?

1276 2018-05-11 21:02:13 When is @theresa_may and @michaelgove going to ban palm oil from the UK?
1277 2018-05-11 21:02:08 Our prices closely track the crude oil price, we pass on reductions as quickly as we can, and shield our customers from dramatic price increases. (3/3)
1278 2018-05-11 21:01:57 We impose sanctions on #Oil producer #Iran, eliminate environmental petro controls, discourage alternative energy, and overheat the economy with unfunded tax cuts for the rich.

1290 2018-05-11 21:00:23 Impossibly compelling? It was one of the worst PL seasons in the last few years.

1298 2018-05-11 21:00:00 Like I said 35% of all oil cdb delieverd is Amazon .  There is hundred of competitors either . Not even close . So what are u talking about ?

1300 2018-05-11 20:59:59 Palm oil is an important ingredient in a range of everyday products. Rising global demand for palm oil has fuelled deforestation in parts of south east Asia, which is why we have set targets to ensure that the palm oil we use comes from sustainable sources. (2)
1301 2018-05-11 20:59:58 Waiting to get my oil changed. There are a father and son in the lobby with me. And they have had the whitest conversation of all time. Here's some topics they hit.
-Hockey Playoffs
-The weather this weekend
-Wine
-"anti-vacci's"
-Imagining where Tiger would be in his career
1302 2018-05-11 20:59:51 Working a banquet and all the guest are representives for big oil and I’m p sure every single one has attended at least two Trump rallies. Enclosed realities and blind to what damage is caused by our privilege.
1303 2018-05-11 20:59:24 And no comment on US oil
1304 2018-05-11 20:59:14 Get rosehip oil xx
1305 2018-05-11 20:59:00 What are they grinding us into? Machine oil? That would probably be my first step as robot overlord if I’m being perfectly honest.
1306 2018-05-11 20:58:51 Pkg has Amazon as a backing . 35%  of all oil cdb related comes from Amazon .  This will come to play somepoint . That isn't even scratching the surface what pkg will be doing in the future .  I can see this company making tens if millions yearly .  It's just a start up
1307 2018-05-11 20:58:31 So when are you going to call for an investigation on the gas and oil companies this is ridiculous to have these prices... People can't afford this and they keep price gouging us Americans... we need a voice...
1308 2018-05-11 20:58:20 Oil prices rallied to lift shares of energy companies and technology extending their recovery 
1309 2018-05-11 20:58:06 Just a nyt, ofcos with my anointing oil
1310 2018-05-11 20:57:48 A perfect idea to ameliorating the plight of the oil communities
1311 2018-05-11 20:57:41 $SPY still 2600-2750 -- bullish trading range w/ hurdles:
>2580 -- earns expectations, global growth (oil+), good valuation
<2750 -- political uncertainty
<2800 -- higher # of rate hikes (2018/19) than expected
<3000 -- fear interest payments increasing (debt)
1312 2018-05-11 20:57:28 I doubt it.. I’d say a small bit! The oil must remove it and then scrubbing it
1313 2018-05-11 20:57:25 So you folks try to throw insults of us Alaskans   Tell me how much your life depends on crude oil
1314 2018-05-11 20:57:24 That's interesting considering most of the social programs that have driven the debt in the crashed oil economy are geared towards lower and middle class.
1315 2018-05-11 20:57:23 Proud of where we are today. Rags to riches.. Shambles to best ever.. Love oil money.
1316 2018-05-11 20:57:22 Fails to make up for voting in favor of legislation that harms Alaska and US ..tongass logging, opening arctic for raping on behalf of oil companies, HJR69 allows wholesale slaughter of wildlife..denial of healthcare for many ..lot of blood on your GOP paws... imo #TheResistance
1317 2018-05-11 20:57:14 Also: kale, pineapple, coconut oil, coconut, and banana or 1/2 avocado - plus lime juice. 
1318 2018-05-11 20:57:13 At least trump didn’t support the murder of a million middle eastern people over oil
1319 2018-05-11 20:57:04 It’s the one I’m most excited about, and the rosehip oil and niacinamide is meant to b rly good for acne scarring so so excited to pamper
1320 2018-05-11 20:56:52 No  but my cousin put it in her baby head she 2 tho she put blue magic / old motor oil and it WORKS like baby girl didn’t have no hair and now it’s thick and long .
1321 2018-05-11 20:56:49 u will regret ZERO of the glossier purchases also the rose hip oil is nice
1322 2018-05-11 20:56:42 Saudis atecokeased too and our oil prices are already rising. Did you notice the price hike? I think it’s just the beginning and that it will be s very expensive summer
1323 2018-05-11 20:56:40 Oil price predicted to hit $100/barrel.

Would these evil men in government reduce the price of fuel?
1324 2018-05-11 20:56:37 This week my wife made 4 purchases (oil change & cosmetics)on Groupon/Living Social.  Totaled approximately $350.
1325 2018-05-11 20:56:22 bae better know how to check oil tho 
1326 2018-05-11 20:56:22 Right, if you can connect higher oil prices to Trump policies please enlighten me.. but thats what happens to oil prices when PDVSA workers are passing out on the job (bc of malnutrition) and OPEC cuts production
1327 2018-05-11 20:56:09 เราใช้ bio oil อยู่ ก็ช่วยลดรอยดำได้ดีอยู่นะคะ

Glossier: Boy Brow, Concealer, Highlighter
1329 2018-05-11 20:55:58 Gas prices are going up with a vengeance. Homeowners keep refinancing to pay their credit card debts; savings are at an all time low while debt is at a all time high ... Need I say more? Even Putin who wants to sell his oil against Iran's is worried.
1330 2018-05-11 20:55:58 I just bottled my first batch of Dandelion Body Oil for the 2018 growing season.  100% organic Dandelion-Ylang Ylang-Lavender Body Oil.  Good for cracked and/or rough skin, wounds, and such.

1331 2018-05-11 20:55:53 Hahaha its real and I know im gonna be roped into this type of convo because my friends fiancé works for a big oil company and all of his friends do to. Sure we have all sorts of sub sets here but your average bro type personality is usually in this industry.
1332 2018-05-11 20:55:53 @simphiwe_nel nah papa I flew in after the oil money  robhino
1333 2018-05-11 20:55:50 I wondered. Same shareholders for Aramco on the BOD for Trans-Canada oil and gas boom here in the U.S. Idk.... 'energy independence' too good to be true.

Except for, SolarCity, at least a privately held company headquartered in the U.S. 
OK. So.... maybe.
1334 2018-05-11 20:55:25 Diesel as in the actual oil?
1335 2018-05-11 20:55:23 @Shazy580 oil+silly string
1336 2018-05-11 20:55:13 The poor state of the oil communities is heart wrenching, thank you GGO for having them in mind.
1337 2018-05-11 20:55:13 SpaceX is the only venture Musk is doing right. I think the Teslas and the Hyperloop are snake oil.
1338 2018-05-11 20:55:08 @BuckSexton @seanhannity SO MUCH for “ OIL INDEPENDENCE “! We’re WORLDS NO1 exporter of oil! With SKY HIG GAS $$$!???
1339 2018-05-11 20:55:06 Oil man meu brother acabou de passR aqui por mim, estava c sdds
1340 2018-05-11 20:55:04 I just took a bath in lavendar oil so I could calm down. I might be done being petty for the day.
1341 2018-05-11 20:54:11 663. Oil provides easy petrodollars which distracts our leadership from creative thinking and actions to provide effective economic and political plans to mobilize the abundant resources human and materials to develop the nation.Privatize the industry and so neutralize its lmpact
1342 2018-05-11 20:53:58 Where are his tweets about the increase in US oil production??
1343 2018-05-11 20:53:52 Anyone in the #Highclere or #Newbury area who does  EMERGENCY boiler repair? Our oil one isn't heating and the house is getting cold quickly! Please connect & DM or if anyone in the #WestBerkshire or #hampshire in the #basingstokeanddeane area please - thanks !!
1344 2018-05-11 20:53:35 Yeah that’s probably more of a flu type thing. Take some paracetamol & ibuprofen & ride the baby out. Hope you feel better soon! If you’re congested do some ‘steaming’ with olbas oil
1345 2018-05-11 20:53:32 Yes. Its about money, not life.  Funny how the pro life party has zero to say about death camps.  Sell them airplanes, oil and misc parts or whatever will make stocks rise and voila. Best buds. Another marketplace to milk.
1346 2018-05-11 20:53:18 Utter lie. Capitalists start wars and profit from weapons and oil. Old spiteful crone lives the good life funded by taxpayers while others struggle in poverty
1347 2018-05-11 20:53:17 Evening, stranger.

I associate with smells; instant coffee + hot cocoa I've had for years, a certain oil even longer. The effect is not as strong as songs and sounds, but it's there.
1348 2018-05-11 20:53:15 Love coconut oil as an occasional deep conditioning treatment
1349 2018-05-11 20:53:13 Great skills to learn. More real life things should be done at schools. More auto mechanics, learn carpentry, accounting, hands on labor, balancing checkbooks, tire changes, oil changes, basic life stuff
1350 2018-05-11 20:53:13 Most people don't know how to eat healthy. Shits filled with oil, sodium and fat. Thats a step above mcdonalds lol.
1351 2018-05-11 20:53:11 @realDonaldTrump @Scavino45 @mercedesschlapp HEY @seanhannity WHAT GOOD IS IT TO BE OIL INDEPENDENT, W/HIGH GAS $$$!??
1352 2018-05-11 20:52:55 @GM @devinwenig since you are on board of directors maybe look into my issue of oil consumption? Will never buy gm product again!
1353 2018-05-11 20:52:54 Must have fed too much Midnight Oil into the fire
1354 2018-05-11 20:52:46 never said their was but we have also never been so close to peace on the Korean Peninsula Regime change i feel can be done the right way if it's not done for profit. Like Iraq and Libya etc. Oil... Running gun's pipelines etc.  If anyone can it's THIS POTUS trust him..
1355 2018-05-11 20:52:35 Sorry for Saffi. Wonder if CBD oil would help I know it can be given to pets. Holland & Barretts sell it. Wonderful for people with Arthritis. Praying Saffi gets free from pain. Hugs to her from me.
1356 2018-05-11 20:52:22 My oil change will take 4 hours? Ok I'll go to breweries in the meantime
1357 2018-05-11 20:52:15 Sometimes your 3 of PENTACLES day is taking your car in for an oil change. 
1358 2018-05-11 20:52:15 Nothing was more brutal than watching those wanda/vision scenes in infinity war... they have no chemistry. they mix together like water and oil
1359 2018-05-11 20:52:12 ok kyle just brung me some jimmy choo oil I smelled it & it’s stuck in my nostrils 
1360 2018-05-11 20:51:55 One thing that eorupean seek out of supporting fanatic regime of Iran is their aim to have an exclusive provider of their oil.
1361 2018-05-11 20:51:55 Lmfaooooo it says argan oil but more like cannabis
1362 2018-05-11 20:51:30 As the hood is popped on my car during an oil change, the guys are working on it & I’m sitting from afar watching like a concerned mom thinking 
“okay back up, give her some space! She’s nervous!”
1363 2018-05-11 20:51:22 Thanks Jimboman! You guys have a good weekend!
1364 2018-05-11 20:51:10 They're losing steam. Have a good weekend God of Indian Trolls!!! God of oil!!!!
1365 2018-05-11 20:51:01 Do you believe the oil sands will be around forever? Do you believe clean energy is a passing fad? The world is transitioning away from carbon based energy like it or not. That doesn't mean we are turning off the taps tomorrow. It means positioning Canada for long term success.
1366 2018-05-11 20:50:43 I shall oil my weapons to victory.
1367 2018-05-11 20:50:13 If only someone would volunteer to fix my oil consumption problem! Or maybe just honor your warranty!
1368 2018-05-11 20:50:09 Yes OK I will say that I absolutely adore a light dressing of olive oil on bread! One of the best parts of Italian restaurants really!! But I'm telling you guys, it was extreme. Like olive oil soup
1369 2018-05-11 20:50:06 My mom just accidentally dripped frankincense oil into my eye and that was the most exciting thing that’s happened today
1370 2018-05-11 20:49:53 First few days trading #forex and $GOLD and $OIL futures again was a moderate success. I forgot that it stops on Friday for a 48hr break. Great to be back.  bottoms up. #cryptobreak #sellBTC
1371 2018-05-11 20:49:41 Olive oil ok?
1372 2018-05-11 20:49:35 There are probably saudi oil princes who do bc it appeals to the same kind of person who'd buy a diamond encrusted skull or a gold plated desert eagle
1373 2018-05-11 20:49:35 I don’t want to be *that* cis white girl but I treated myself to some CBD oil with some of my Fringe earnings and I had forgotten how it feels to not have some random part of your body hurting #chronicpain #pkd #vapetrain #iteventasteslikeberries
1374 2018-05-11 20:49:34 Fantastic! Remind me again which countries we can't sell oil and gas to at the moment?
1375 2018-05-11 20:49:34 Inspired by small ancient oil lamps on our trip to Greece, Roger made these little gems to be included in his display of creations sold at the Montpelier Museum Shop. They are made from a variety of wood harvested on the estate of President James Madison.
1376 2018-05-11 20:49:30 Trump's promise to keep us out of stupid wars was an obvious reference to Bush.  But he followed up with assenine comments like we should have kept the oil.  Forrest Gump sums it up...Stupid is as stupid does.
1377 2018-05-11 20:49:29 they are no more an authority to be considered as something in middle east but only robbers stealing oil from middle east @cnni @washingtonpost @WSJ @nytimes @UN @EU_Commission @AFP
1378 2018-05-11 20:49:24 The point was that data is like oil. Without raw data, you can't get information.
1379 2018-05-11 20:49:18 @TeamCavuto What happened to America becoming independant  on oil & gas. BS again or oil companies screwing us.
1380 2018-05-11 20:49:09 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
1381 2018-05-11 20:49:08 Please move on to something other then oil, maybe sunlight or hydrogen for the next 500 years  #KeepItInTheGround
1382 2018-05-11 20:48:54 Only an invulnerable kryptonian would take the risk of frying eggs topless. Oil burns are not fun.
1383 2018-05-11 20:48:30 These levels are not sustainable, the overall long contracts are coming down which may be a sign the unwinding will be sooner than later, the bullish sentiment in the market is still high
1384 2018-05-11 20:48:26 I mean, you will have excess oil! But it can be re-used for a little while after if you clean through it well enough and store it somewhere dark and cool after. Unless you’re deep frying, you don’t end up wasting a ton of oil though. Just a half-inch deep is all that’s needed!
1385 2018-05-11 20:48:25 Hey Simon, would you like a bag each of my Ras el Hanout & Rogan Josh spices for uber green olive oil & crusty bread dippage?
@GoEveryEatEverything I also have awesome dry cimmi churri & Greek seasoning. Rogan Josh, Ras el Hanout & Zhataar are my best. 
I use them All at home
1386 2018-05-11 20:48:18 Withdrew from PCA, helped coal Industry, helped our energy sector by cutting regulations-keystone pipeline opened- which will open up oil& gas exploration, made it possible for companies to come back to US-jobs!, rebuilding military &funding our military, 1st amendment protection
1387 2018-05-11 20:48:16 They exploded an H-Bomb and collapsed the mountain. That is not going to be an easy reconstruction. They basically put themselves out of business, and the vise of sanctions has been tightened. US patrols of RU ships blocks oil supplies. They're hurting. Good.
1388 2018-05-11 20:48:14 Yeah, cause you don’t little to no oil. We don’t use oil at all with it
1389 2018-05-11 20:48:14 Low fat meals, hot air circulation instead of using oil/grease to fry, easy cleaning, etc
1390 2018-05-11 20:48:14 I got my oil changed at my usual place and one of the guys asked me how much for this stuffed duck sitting in my back seat, I told him I figured I’d give it to a kid that saw it and wanted it anyway so he could have it and he was so excited telling me abt his daughter &
1391 2018-05-11 20:47:51 展示形態は手持ちです。棺は人の手で運ぶので設置をせずに手で持つ事が大切だと思いました。
全身真っ黒を着ようと思い、これまた久しぶりにゴスロリを着用…
1392 2018-05-11 20:47:30 why don't we just turn the sand to glass and take the oil
1393 2018-05-11 20:47:25 That's the point. Pipelines can move oil with electric pumps. Electric transport vehicles are still in development. The damage done from moving oil via road and rail outweighs pipeline spills, which are few.
1394 2018-05-11 20:47:23 Came straight out of work and came to get an oil change, like wow I’m such an adult 
1395 2018-05-11 20:47:19 I wouldn't say all Texans but Oil and Gas is to Houston as Finance is to NYC. Also Texan bros gravitate to this industry so more often than not you get caught in a convo about it hahaha.
1396 2018-05-11 20:47:04 Mr Gore people of Canada who understand air water and ground pollution are wellcoming you. People who don't understand are servients of oil companies.
1397 2018-05-11 20:46:55 If you use 1/4 Sesame oil to 3/4 Avacado oil, you barely, if at all, need seasoning on your fried wings.

1398 2018-05-11 20:46:46 Couple them. Hemp oil hands amazing.
1399 2018-05-11 20:46:40 This is still an excuse for increasing supply of heavy crude when world has substantial amounts of conventional light crude oil that can be used while transitioning to #renewable energy. Why expand #bitumen extraction when there is sufficient light crude? #cdnpoli
1400 2018-05-11 20:46:33 With gas prices steadily climbing since last year, it was SO nice taxpayers to give ‘big Oil’ all that corporate welfare last tax season 
1401 2018-05-11 20:46:20 New fragrances have arrived from Lorenzo Villoresi in Florence! We are very excited to offer not only Eua de Toillette, but a selection of oil based fragrances from this line as well.
1402 2018-05-11 20:46:17 Enlighten me cherry lips
1403 2018-05-11 20:46:12 You just had to talk about Forte oil . Business men sha.
1404 2018-05-11 20:46:01 Windmills can make for some fun long range plinking.
1405 2018-05-11 20:45:58 $COP moved to take control over several terminals from PDVSA in the Caribbean. Crucial for about 16 percent of Venezuela’s oil exports. “A total disaster” for Venezuela, says Francisco Monaldi, a fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute. Extremely hard for them to replace.
1406 2018-05-11 20:45:37 Hmm..maybe he should check his oil level by laying some rubber?

1407 2018-05-11 20:45:23 SPEAKING OF WHICH: I think the CBD oil might actually be helping? It could completely be coincidence, but my nerve issues haven’t been as bad at night and I’ve noticed a couple of other changes.

I keep notes in my diary, so we’ll see if this pattern continues!

1412 2018-05-11 20:45:00 Use extra virgin coconut oil to remove makeup.
1413 2018-05-11 20:44:56 I swear by every single one of those ordinary products (except the aha/bha) but I don’t know if I like the disciple oil anymore bc it’s smells too strong 
1414 2018-05-11 20:44:50 Girl why didn’t you put coconut oil between your thighs
1415 2018-05-11 20:44:45 Quebró Oil... ¿Quépasará con su planta de San Lorenzo? Peligro ambiental...
1416 2018-05-11 20:44:45 Fake drugs for sale to fool the poor .. we are back to the days of snake oil sales bull in a bottle!
1417 2018-05-11 20:44:37 No but I know from experience how much oil a gmc uses!
1418 2018-05-11 20:44:35 Always wanted to fry but am always worried I'm going to have excess oil that I just have to toss after
1419 2018-05-11 20:44:35 When you are just trying to get an oil change at the place your dad told you to go to and it ends up being sketch as fuck
1420 2018-05-11 20:44:25 My car runs lol it just leaks oil in the process that’s the only problem
1421 2018-05-11 20:44:11 Hahahahaha ah no really! Mustn’t be in our shops then! Good luck getting it off with baby oil chickxxx

1431 2018-05-11 20:42:52 Start with fixing gmc they use to much oil! And no warranty repair for it!
1432 2018-05-11 20:42:47 Never buy olive oil in a clear bottle.
1433 2018-05-11 20:42:38 Go Google it and you'll see all the businesses winding down contacts with Iran gas going up which will help russia sell oil they couldn't under Obama sanctions and 45 was slow to out new sanctions on them and is not protecting our elections from them meddling in them
1434 2018-05-11 20:42:26 Update: same great grandmother put a 16 dollar tub of organic coconut oil in my buggy. She chastised me in the checkout line when she realized I had put that crap back on the shelf
1435 2018-05-11 20:42:23 Glad to see a documentary about palm oil, orangutans and SE Asia’s rainforests that pulls out all the stops and is as hard-hitting and difficult to watch as it should be.

every tanker is a potential spill. 
oil interests are stifling innovative, superior technologies.
1439 2018-05-11 20:42:04 Hello alll! Come see us at the Herb Faire in Terre Haute tomorrow OR in Bridgeton at the Art & Wine affair, we will be in both places....and will have our CBD oil available! Will also have CBD tinctures in Terre Haute!
1440 2018-05-11 20:42:03 rub with olive oil,nice rud down with garlic salt and pepper. sear each side on grill about on high heat 5 to 6 min a side then put on low heat about 15 to 20 minutes. i cook loin to 145°
1441 2018-05-11 20:41:53 There is absolutely no empirical evidence to support your statement. Taxes don't reduce emissions. Never have and never will. And if the Conservatives did nothing (lie), how did Canada become THE world leader in cleaner oil and gas technologies? Particularly Alberta. Cons 40 yrs.
1442 2018-05-11 20:41:47 Start with better engineering of gmc! They use 2 plus quarts of oil in between oil changes and will not fix under warranty!
1443 2018-05-11 20:41:43 I'm not sure where it cam from but there's a party hat full of candy and tequila in my oil diffuser.
1444 2018-05-11 20:41:38 Somebody should nuke Jerusalem so nobody can have it. @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama since it's only water in Flint, not oil gold or anything like that
1445 2018-05-11 20:41:29 Makes you wonder why Faslane 30 miles from Glasgow When quite easily have been put in England & reason given against Public Safety... How Much oil is off the West Coast & who knows???
1446 2018-05-11 20:41:23 When we put the CEOs of oil cos in prison for their crimes against the environment and humanity, their waterboy servant politicians have to go too. New rule.
1447 2018-05-11 20:41:14 Would think so. But we have a lot of weird people who protest everything. Most of them have never seen an oil well but I think that some of them have actually been on a mountain.
1448 2018-05-11 20:41:13 Getting an oil change is all fine and dandy til you get in the waiting room
1449 2018-05-11 20:41:12 Many egos in to many paths.  We Christians are at war with the wide road.  Rested,  but most exhausted.  Much share in Pentecost.  Much in Cayce.  I return where i shall see the sea cover the Sun.  I require a retired oil rig.

1451 2018-05-11 20:40:59 Oil prices up. Gasoline prices up. Economy still booming.
1452 2018-05-11 20:40:51 Others have to wait until after dozens of people are killed in a crude oil train derailment.
1453 2018-05-11 20:40:45 His stank wafted all the way to Anchorage AK after a braggart acquaintance said that her oil and gas Poobah brother in Dallas golfed with trump in the mid 80s, talking like he was the Prince Regent. I had no idea who he was but I paid attention after that. Didn't like what I saw.
1454 2018-05-11 20:40:45 No, Saudi Arabia is a different issue. More complicated, on the surface they act like friends, mainly because we buy their oil, however underneath who knows what the heck is going on for the last 40 years over there.
1455 2018-05-11 20:40:44 Who cares haha. I hope it stays private... Then the manipulative scum who pump low market cap crap will not be able to get their claws into it to play games or get their snouts in the trough. You know who I refer to.
1456 2018-05-11 20:40:40 Iran has oil reserves and they dumped Petroleum Dollars. The religious people say Iranians are condemned in Bible.
1457 2018-05-11 20:40:30 If only they would engineer their GMC not to use so much oil, or if they would honor warranty!

Can't do cum shows tonight but! I thought maybe we could do glittery oil shenanigans, drinks, smokes, and other stuff :D
1464 2018-05-11 20:39:56 Today I wrote about CBD oil and pups, life is good guys!
1465 2018-05-11 20:39:54 @TeamCavuto I thought we now had more oil than God. Why would gas prices go up and why would tensions with Iran make it go up if we have so much oil?

1469 2018-05-11 20:39:11 Had a coffee with breakfast. Another while waiting for my oil change. Now sipping a grande latte and could easily crawl into a ball under my desk and sleep for days. This fatigue is no joke. And it's only 1:40pm. TGIF to the max.

1474 2018-05-11 20:38:29 For #TXGovDebate:
Clean water is a growing concern. What will you do specifically to protect drinking water sources and aquifers from risks associated with fracking and oil production?
1475 2018-05-11 20:38:29 Get into the habit of cooking yourself a beautiful Breakfast. Fry tomatoes and mushrooms in garlic and oil, cook scrambled eggs, cut into fresh avocado and sprinkle lemon juice. Sit down, eat and do nothing else

1486 2018-05-11 20:37:17 Try not to drive it over the weekend, the amount of damage having no oil can do is not cheap 
1487 2018-05-11 20:37:14 No. Oil is expensive.  I tried the prescription route for 10 years to high levels.  They sedated or masked for a couple of years.  Bad side effects.  I am much healthier now.
1488 2018-05-11 20:36:59 Yes it is Aramco owns Motiva ...where do you think they send oil ?
1489 2018-05-11 20:36:58 The world is using a large amount of Oil and that isn’t stopping anytime soon, the world would be better off using Canadian oil due the environmental standards we have over other producing countries in the world and that includes the US.

1501 2018-05-11 20:35:29 Any clown saying “oil sands not tar sands” is trying to revise history. “Tar Island” was on the map north of Fort McMurray for years. It wasn’t renamed “Oil Island” in some purge, but it could have been.
1502 2018-05-11 20:35:26 Please retire. A large majority of americans DO NOT agree with your policies. You seem dead set on choking out the middle class and uplifting the corporations, oil barons and the ultra rich. I will watch with hope that you will prove me wrong. Not holding my breathe though.

1522 2018-05-11 20:33:23 It’s asinine to take subsidies from gas and oil companies. It would decimate the lower and middle classes. Subsidies are necessary until we can viably transition to renewable energy.

1598 2018-05-11 20:21:23 A lot of white people never put oil directly on their hair without washing it out right after! White folks general think oily = dirty in my experience. I’ve repeatedly gotten this comment
1599 2018-05-11 20:21:18 Oil change worker - hey man it’s going to be a few dollars extra because of the larger filter 
Me - ...ok
Worker - want to move your stuff so I can vacuum
Me - moves stuff 
Worker - want to just vacuum yourself 
Me - HAHAHAHAHAHAHAA not at all

1601 2018-05-11 20:21:06 What do you mean by not heading to recession when an economy of 6% fall to 2.84. There is no magic that can stop the economy from going into recession. Because you can't diversify from oil in less than 2 years with oil going down to $27bpd then. Diversification is not by mouth.

1603 2018-05-11 20:20:52 Texans must be too stubborn for their own good.  why was Cruz ever re-elected in the first place?! Besides being completely owned by big oil and money - he's done nothing to help The People who he was elected to represent.  can we strip him of his citizenship?!
1604 2018-05-11 20:20:34 Its not our responsibility but after all nothing new with this country. Fighting for oil and kissing ass to the jews.
1605 2018-05-11 20:20:21 What about also not using palm oil ??
1606 2018-05-11 20:20:18 Money really doesn’t buy happiness. But, It buys gas, tires, food, oil changes, rent, water, lights & Netflix. Isn’t that close enough?
1607 2018-05-11 20:19:46 Dear Art, one observation regarding weekly EIA report for your consideration: the report last 12mths consistently indicates gasoline build but distillate draw (under 5 yrs av) >considering refinery process >we conclude: too much light oil but not enough heavy oil refinery.
1608 2018-05-11 20:19:45 Wait. Don't people generally do that anyway? Put oil or such to moisturise it.
1609 2018-05-11 20:19:40 Remembeing why I stopped going to @jiffylube. I just want an oil change, top off washer fluid and vacuum. 

Tire rotation?
No.

Cabin air filter?
No. 

Engine air filter? 
No. 

Transmission fluid change?
No. 

Radiator fluid change?
NO!!! 

JUST CHANGE THE OIL!!

1613 2018-05-11 20:19:23 Since Russia and Iran are trading partners and share similar views the US might be subjected to higher oil prices since Iran and Russia hold the largest oil reserves on the planet. We are pumping a lot of oil but it's all going into the global market.
1614 2018-05-11 20:19:21 I guess its for folks that dont wanna drench their food in oil even tho its so fucking good lol

1620 2018-05-11 20:18:48 I went to Audi for an oil change and this is how it went: 

Employee: You drive an Audi???
Me: ...no I drive a Toyota I just thought you guys would like to do my oil change
Employee: Oh you drive an A4?
Me: ...uh it’s an A5
Employee: Oh...
1621 2018-05-11 20:18:31 Wasn't kinder supposed to go to China and Asia? I just read it is expected around 1 million more EVs on the road this year? Mostly in China. See @DanWoy
China is investing big in Iran oil fields, guess who just made that cheaper for them.
1622 2018-05-11 20:18:09 oil spill
1623 2018-05-11 20:17:55 But... but... but plastic is made with oil, is not recycleable and does not break down in landfills. It's quite a dilemma for diehard environmentalists since EVERYTHING uses natural resources.
1624 2018-05-11 20:17:53 Bullshit! 
They trim your circuit board and oil your gears!
1625 2018-05-11 20:17:50 Well that would be the fault if the person doing unnecessary interventions for oil ;)
1626 2018-05-11 20:16:59 GEJ achievement in 3 or 6 years at a time he sold oil for as much as $150?

Oya visit Google and come back
1627 2018-05-11 20:16:51 Frustrating coincidence - this tweet comes right after the riots in Kerem Shalom, where Pals burn the pipes serving their oil &gas needs & days before they plan to have bigger riots to cause the annihilation of Israel. I wonder what Nathan & Ilan are going to suggest?
1628 2018-05-11 20:16:50 Cop's and Blacks are like Oil & Water!

1637 2018-05-11 20:15:43 /1
this is hideous mismanagement by multi levels of gov't
I'd love to hear from the federal Liberals and our Provincial NDP how THIS WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.Even in the face of rising global oil prices, Imperial Oil has announced it will put a hold on growth of its projects,
1638 2018-05-11 20:15:37 Have you heard of full-spectrum cannabis oil?
1639 2018-05-11 20:15:28 Another idea is upping healthy fats… avocado, coconut oil, etc
1640 2018-05-11 20:15:26 Saudis a corrupt and stupid (not all but many) turkey have a bigger Economy and gdp without oil i Need not millions of dollars i want only that My country Gets bigger and bigger this is for me and million turks The only Dream!
1641 2018-05-11 20:15:19 Agreed. Bush did 911, blaming the "terrorists", giving him a reason to invade the midle east which is full of oil and guess what. Bush likes oil. In the meanwhile dealing weapons to the so called terrorists fueling the war over there.
1642 2018-05-11 20:15:09 Not just talking about BC ,  how about transfer payment from Alberta large majority of that cash  is from energy . Sk &Alberta getting oil to market would benefit Cda NOT buying from other countries or selling our oil to US @ huge discount so they can reap the profits.
1643 2018-05-11 20:14:52 How nice. And on the other hand your decision to pull out of the Iran deal is sending the price of oil back up over $100 a barrel. So, we can use the money saved on drugs to pay for gas. Dumb, as usual.
1644 2018-05-11 20:14:37 Saudi Arabia and many oil producing countries who didn't do any election during that time and they have their ministers intact were also affected by the low oil price.
1645 2018-05-11 20:14:34 There no problem. Poppi made of special alloy. No need for rust or oil.

1649 2018-05-11 20:14:12 In general, soy ink is not 100% biodegradable, because the pigments and other additives that are mixed with the oil are the same as those used in petroleum-based inks. However, it is far more eco-friendly.

Iran deal. All about oil

Rich get richer
1654 2018-05-11 20:13:37 How can no one (media and economic experts and strategists) is talking about the consequences of The Death of the Iran - US Nuclear deal, and the economic fall outs such as the price of Oil hitting $70 a barrel?
1655 2018-05-11 20:13:37 put a can of chickpeas & chopped kale & lil tomatoes in a bowl
pour olive oil&salt&garlic/onion powder& turmeric& whatever else in there massage it all up
roast it on a big pan at 400 for 15
dump it in a bowl
mix harissa & sour cream together & plop that on top
cram it in ur face
1656 2018-05-11 20:13:33 Etaé works wonders on my hair. My hair is super curly when I wash it. It’s the only thing I use. That and wild growth oil.
1657 2018-05-11 20:13:30 The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords. Cast your burden upon the LORD, he will sustain you: he will never suffer the righteous to be moved. #MAGA #MEGA
1658 2018-05-11 20:13:26 Indeed, volatility has calmed down.  Still have premium opportunities in options... bonds, precious metals.  Even crude oil looks interesting for short-term options; weeklies.  Stocks may be poised for better early revenues.
1659 2018-05-11 20:13:23 Record spec longs versus producers such as Mexico who are beginning to sell 2019 futures. I wonder who wins
1660 2018-05-11 20:12:48 Okay but why does Men hair shampoo/conditioner seem to have a 25 in 1 shampoo and conditioner combo along with face wash, toothpaste, deodorant, engine oil, use it to wash your car, wax your car, use as protein shake and smell like old spice all in one?
1661 2018-05-11 20:12:41 "Golden Goose" Perhaps 3 water dams flowing out of Canada. We'll see who is in control of North America. No Wood, Oil, and Water!

1664 2018-05-11 20:12:31 Have you seen the one about the "710 cap has fallen off the engine, what should I do?" 710 being 'OIL'?
1665 2018-05-11 20:12:29 He’s also all about coal and oil and was a psychotic racist about Obama, sounds better for any liberal than Manchin to me
1666 2018-05-11 20:12:20 I grow this in my little garden. Made garlic butter for freezer and garlic oil for fridge this weekend.
1667 2018-05-11 20:12:12 It’s been high for months now....the unwind will be fun but when?  I thought it would pop already.
1668 2018-05-11 20:12:06 My momma asked me: What is coconut oil good for?   Me: Everything.  Sick? Coconut oil. Well? Coconut oil. Hungry? Coconut oil. Full? Coconut oil.

1670 2018-05-11 20:11:56 @KFC_Ghana heard you've opened a branch at Takoradi, if so then thanks for gvn us a fair share; 3yrs of tweets asking for a branch, prayers finally answered on behalf of the 'OIL CITY'
1671 2018-05-11 20:11:33 You're not a fucking businessman,  they have ethics.

You're a street crook, a grifter,  a snake oil salesman.

You are less than scum.
1672 2018-05-11 20:11:29 First off you dorks! The markets don’t move that fast! The price of oil is determined by worldwide demand and commodity markets! Stop lying to the American people, you’re communists and lying is all you’ve got, we understand
1673 2018-05-11 20:11:23 Was this sign paid for by an oil company?
1674 2018-05-11 20:11:21 I understand that many Albertans choose $ over environment. But fact is outside your tar sand puddles, sane people understand the oil era must end.
1675 2018-05-11 20:11:14 How are ever to buy anything anything doesn’t contain palm oil? Just ban it altogether
1676 2018-05-11 20:10:51 The guy at this oil change place knew my name and idk how... I haven’t been here in over 5 months!!!
1677 2018-05-11 20:10:33 Maybe if there wasn't a war in the Middle East for the last century, Isis wouldn't exist.

Shame on you all!

1681 2018-05-11 20:10:07 Just a little bit of oil, and... Come on! Come on, you little son of a bitch!
1682 2018-05-11 20:10:05 @Morrisons please can you tell me what the policy is on stocking foods containing palm oil. Will you be following Iceland’s lead and stop this! It’s critical to the survival of our wildlife that we act now !
1683 2018-05-11 20:09:40 We should have taken Iran's oil. We could lower the gas prices and help save money for our crunchy roll subscriptions.
1684 2018-05-11 20:09:39 BTW - love love love Scott Pruitt !!!!!! Love Big Oil and love my Sooners...
1685 2018-05-11 20:09:38 Within the restrictions of the cmtee working, I'll do my best

1687 2018-05-11 20:09:15 bcuz the new oil burning rules has affected mercedes more than ferrari and now ferraribhas the best engine and the best car so they changed the tyres as vettel said in pre season testing that mercedes burn their tyres in purpose to push pirelli to change them under safety
1688 2018-05-11 20:09:15 Iraq management post invasion was bad. Read George Tenet’s book: At The Center of The Storm. He discuss the planning failures that lead up to the insurgency. We now have the benefit of Iraq to help avoid the same mistakes & a President willing to take the oil to pay for it all
1689 2018-05-11 20:09:03 I’m convinced ANY problem your having in life can be solved with coconut oil & water 
1690 2018-05-11 20:09:00 not high enough yet to answer that correctly, my oil hasn't kicked in yet
1691 2018-05-11 20:08:57 Czech Rep has significant lithium, North Sea oil would be disrupted, Germany would side with Kremlin diplomacy and severely limit US influence. Likely Balkans goes up in flames and Italy gas hub for non Russian oil dead.
1692 2018-05-11 20:08:37 Oil spill from 3rd & palou up to Thurgood.
1693 2018-05-11 20:08:23 coconut oil is the loml
1694 2018-05-11 20:08:14 Is the orange man with the little hands , goin to drive up the price of oil for all his pals ?
1695 2018-05-11 20:07:45 We originally took car in because every possible light on the dashboard came on - airbag, coolant, handbrake, Abs, 4x4, light bulb warning, oil etc. What has that got to do with gear box?

What's next for USOP?
Will it ever be relisted anywhete?
1698 2018-05-11 20:06:45 Trump said (just before the chemical attack) he planned to pull out of Iran. The WMD's needed a response- the response was a strike.  His goal hasn't changed.  We are nationalists - don't want their country or their oil.  We've got our own.
1699 2018-05-11 20:06:33 That doesn't make any sense. And apparently Oil Ocean isn't there either.
1700 2018-05-11 20:06:30 Nobody wants to see Infinity War with me? Well oil beef hooked.
1701 2018-05-11 20:06:00 One time I was checking my oil at a gas station and a man asked me who taught me how to do that in a flirtatious/impressed way and I was like uh my mom showed me like when I was 16, men are ugly lol
1702 2018-05-11 20:05:55 Dude use bio oil! It’s for scars and it’s wonderful!! My scars are like almost gone & my face used to be bad remember?
1703 2018-05-11 20:05:48 I be loving my car until I gotta pay car insurance , filll it up, brakes , oil change etc;  I be like take the wholeeeee car back ! Fck it !
1704 2018-05-11 20:05:48 I wasn't either until I smelled the essential oil, tagetes, while listening to Kiwi. I thought - oh, I get it now. It was an intrinsic thing, no logical explanation.
1705 2018-05-11 20:05:34 Plain with salt and oil....
1706 2018-05-11 20:05:34 People will ask for a Cake. But if you give them Eggs, oil, butter, batter, a pan and oven, they get frustrated an leave the kitchen.
1707 2018-05-11 20:05:25 Oh my!  Oh Hell 
It is here.  And they are late and have no oil. What are they going to do to help themselves
1708 2018-05-11 20:05:07 Assuming you’re right, if they did, so what?  What is the strategic significance of those states?  How much oil do they produce?  How much lithium or cobalt?  Is it just that they are NATO members?  You really gonna let your kids bleed for Riga?
1709 2018-05-11 20:05:06 I’m going to slide in this olive oil, oh my God
1710 2018-05-11 20:05:01 Car cleaned and washed , tank on Florida , and all i need now is an oil change but ion feel like it right now 
1711 2018-05-11 20:04:43 Alaskans own 450,621 shares of CHEVRON CORP, worth $48,383,177. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in UNITED STATES.
1712 2018-05-11 20:04:32 The company is doing well now... It doesn't make any sense to me... Specially now that the company is profitable and oil prices are going up...
1713 2018-05-11 20:04:32 Moms okay with smoking CBD but not weed so guess whos entire family just went and bought CBD oil lol
1714 2018-05-11 20:04:14 Bro 35$ oil change turns into a 95$ purchase of straight filters, oil change, headlights, and just nonsense I feel like I’m dead just getting shitted on and when I leave they all just laugh lmao.
1715 2018-05-11 20:04:02 Uh yea...Venezuela. Let’s see how it plays out, but the mixture is perfect, because, wait for it...they have OIL!!!!
1716 2018-05-11 20:03:48 Russia supplies oil to Europe. Putin going to cut US out? Trump given a 20% stake in Rosneft, right? Was that ever verified? Is is dependent on him lifting sanctions?
1717 2018-05-11 20:03:45 Looking to buy a rotary dryer very large one all so need some 30-50 ft  augurs, three and 4 inch oil well pipe about 200 feet. stainless steel  tanks and steel tanks or bins. Packaging equipment and one 4-6 ton  forklift and 2 bobcat type bucket loaders.
1718 2018-05-11 20:03:44 Trump’s oil baron cronies are cheering.  And now we know why Trump turned his back on this deal.
1719 2018-05-11 20:03:35 Ya guys have a lot of oil, potential for tourism and much more, but that dosen't make you the strongest economy in the world. There is still to much work to be done, and having taxes is good, look at us in Norway. We have a sea of oil, but we don't need it. (2)
1720 2018-05-11 20:03:34 USA does what it does best, destabilising coitriries  with rich oil and gas.
They cannot afford these countries to band together possibly abandon petro dollar.
If they did, US economy would tank
1721 2018-05-11 20:03:29 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
1722 2018-05-11 20:03:28 Wife has Coconut oil, Almond and cherry shower wash, Mango shower gel ,orange facial scrub....sometimes i wonder if its for cleaning or to make a dessert
1723 2018-05-11 20:03:24 Does he still believe oil is an abiotic resource?

1725 2018-05-11 20:02:49 Alhamdoulilah, may Allah make you guys stronger and better. But remember that in 2014, you guys were on the brink of a economic collapse. 92% of the total amount of export was Oil, according to Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. The unemployment rate isn't that good. (1)
1726 2018-05-11 20:02:48 Wow really? The sponsor will be the Brazilian state run oil cartel? That’ll be weird.
1727 2018-05-11 20:02:33 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*
1728 2018-05-11 20:02:24 You got any thoughts on oil? I found a decent site to view the curves and spreads, but still working on getting it all in realtime unfortunately.. Still have a long on but todays price action was a little surprising for me

1732 2018-05-11 20:02:00 Everytime I get an oil change, these spots catch the come up on me. Straight could be speaking nonsense idk.

Me “How much?”

1744 2018-05-11 20:00:00 I know there are thousands of people who would really appreciate it. Navigating your way around palm oil products is a nightmare!
1745 2018-05-11 19:59:41 The inconvenient truth is they want our oil at a discount, TM would threaten that.

1748 2018-05-11 19:59:15 To control the oil reserves the Rothschilds through the US GOVERNMENT will ensure Venezuela is trapped n the only saving grace is the US $. If Venezuela rejects the US  $ then it's more turmoil. If Venezuela accepts it loses control of its oil.

1753 2018-05-11 19:58:40 turns out - middle aged men that work at oil change shops on rainy days when there's no business read kanye west tweets in british accents and roast the shit out of them
1754 2018-05-11 19:58:39 Touché. Khamenei is not the issue here, bro. USA loves chaos in other parts of the world so as to make weapons sales, etc. Unlucky for you guys, oil and gas is also a major pull factor. Brace for some tough times.

1760 2018-05-11 19:58:03 You promised the world with your tax cuts. Oil companies got HUGE tax breaks and gas is up $0.50 at the pump.

Do Americans a favor, don't promise anything WE can't afford.
1761 2018-05-11 19:57:50 Because @GOP doesn't want @GovLarryHogan to run for Senate as they do with Rick Scott, so they don't care about appeasing his state in any way when there's profit to be made for oil companies.
1762 2018-05-11 19:57:41 If you've ever had a deli sub and thought to yourself "you know what would be awesome? If this sub had like 40 oz. of oil & vinegar dumped on it."  - Then Jersey Mike's is for you

1786 2018-05-11 19:54:26 You all ignore the fact that the JCPOA allowed Iran to export more oil through the iranian oil bourse. Now, oil exports out of iran are restricted and Saudi + Russia can control the oil supply and skyrocket prices.

1790 2018-05-11 19:53:48 He's a useful figure, not a snake oil salesman like some might have you believe, but not a prophet or a speaker of ultimate truth. I find his views and works towards individual identity/responsibility inspiring. He's done more good than bad regarding mental health in my eyes.

The reasons why I have downplayed the predictions of $100 a barrel #oil are below:
1. No solid proofs
2. No formulas 
3. Untold agenda
4. $100 is too low based on their fears and 'insights.' I'd say at least $200 or $500 or even above $1,000 in an event of #Armageddon...
1804 2018-05-11 19:52:14 When it was banging it was the piggy bank to smooth away all worries
When it fell it became just 'the bonus', and something hardly mentioned
Now it has risen(tho way short of the $113) it's the big topic again.

It's not*all about oil*for nats..just about 90% for 90% of 'em...
1805 2018-05-11 19:52:12 There is an eror in ur coments sir.

1809 2018-05-11 19:51:35 Thanks. So what has been the consequences of Buhari’s rule 4 preserving or expanding British interests in Nigeria (oil & gas, security, trade, education etc ) & how would Britain act if it’s indeed the case they use their private  doctors 4 foreign policy or trade goals?
1810 2018-05-11 19:51:33 I don’t know how to change oil though :/ and I kinda needed it done now since I’ve been pushing it to the side
1811 2018-05-11 19:51:33 I don’t eat anything with palm oil in it. It is high in saturated fat, unhealthy.

1813 2018-05-11 19:51:19 on the other side, Utd have a deal to use saudi arabia's oil money till 2030 for its development and pay off glazers money + loans + interests.
Interesting thing, the ownership still remains with glazers.
But "own money"is Glazing Greed if u know what I mean. 
1814 2018-05-11 19:51:19 Will we ever answer this question?
1815 2018-05-11 19:51:17 This is why Canada is losing 15 Billion per year, we can’t get our oil to foreign markets without going through the US and then they make the additional profit off our oil. If the oil is being sold wouldn’t you want Canada to make the extra 15 Billion per year over the USA?
1816 2018-05-11 19:51:15 No oil help in the west but we have to send millions in equalization???BULLSHIT!

1820 2018-05-11 19:50:35 I sold my first bottle of oil for the day. The intention behind this one is to aid in the process of attracting PROSPERity. To prosper.  I’m naming each oil something different. Today, it’s “SADE” pronounced SHA-DAY.

1838 2018-05-11 19:48:28 #bbcaq Liam, stop referring to the "oil companies in Aberdeen" and inferring how you are somehow helping with your unicorns and fantasy trade policy.  We don't like you, and would be better off without your suicidal Brexit. Let us remain, or give us a #PeoplesVote!
1839 2018-05-11 19:48:15 We need to zoom in on the issue of fracking in the UK especially Scotland at the moment. I think this islands too small to drain gas and oil natural resources we are the size of a state in the USA which can accomodate fracking and has large natural supplies of oil and gas
1840 2018-05-11 19:48:13 Can’t compete? Companies would be very profitable if we were getting fair market value but do to the lack of infrastructure and 99% of our oil being sold to one customer (USA) they can dictate the price which is lower then the WTI price.
1841 2018-05-11 19:48:02 Looks fine. Do you use beard oil?
1842 2018-05-11 19:47:59 its a creme fraiche based sauce, mixed it with a bit of olive oil, seasoned it and heated it. Easiest sauce ever, quite good  tho
1843 2018-05-11 19:47:57 If you have tires with different wear it can mess up your ABS and be dangerous. I change my oil every 3k Miles. Battery is incredibly impressive unless you have a stick shift.

1845 2018-05-11 19:47:38 Been since 2017? Unless you're talking about Japan was it earliar? I watched this fictional movie called Sector 19 about a Korean/Japan oil rig being hit by a alien substance. It ended on a odd note saying I think 2015(?) Japanese oil rigs need to be in Japanese territory or else

1848 2018-05-11 19:47:15 The Beverly hillbillies probably felt the same way when they found  all that oil as I do when a tweet gets a bunch of likes.
1849 2018-05-11 19:47:08 So the #StopKM  movement is really just a bunch of U.S. billionaires protecting their oil derived wealth and using a bunch of uneducated schmucks to do it.
1850 2018-05-11 19:47:08 Not today, I boiled them in their skins and then tossed them in olive oil and mint. I did roast the broccoli and aubergine in the oven with turmeric, chilli and olive oil
1851 2018-05-11 19:46:32 WTI Crude Oil -0.9% to 70.70 bbl $USO

1858 2018-05-11 19:45:54 You are paying someone with skill and talent to rub oil on you.  Very different from those of us that want to it for the sake of doing it!

1861 2018-05-11 19:45:49 You are correct! I think she was saying that the image is confusing considering it's trying to advertise the Kronjuwelen boxer shorts while on a model. However, a "close up" would send the wrong message, and be more disconcerting and "graphic" than it needs to be.

1864 2018-05-11 19:45:32 I would be calling in the Oil companies and ask why gas is so high with the glut of oil we have? There are ships loaded with no place to put it.  33 cent jump here in St. Louis over night.

1870 2018-05-11 19:45:21 Les Straud covered this a long time ago as a good way to start a fire when you’re stranded and have some leftover snacks handy. It’s actually because they’re cooked in oil and the grease on them is flammable.

1880 2018-05-11 19:44:06 Unfortunately the tension with #Iran and his withdrawal from #Irandeal has made the oil prices going high about 80$/b. #Russia & Iran are happy and US citizen will pay more for his living expenses

1897 2018-05-11 19:43:01 It’s our responsibility to restore forests, to stop poaching, end palm oil based goods and shrink our carbon footprint in more ways than i could ever list on Twitter. But thank you for that seemingly obvious point. Stop talking, start doing.
1898 2018-05-11 19:42:54 They want the money and the oil. It seems a little greedy, but very EU, to assert moral superiority as well.
1899 2018-05-11 19:42:38 And if we import oil from desert countries we pay money for it. And the desert people import fruits, spices, grains, sea food a lot from us. The technology to them is provided by us indians. Once their oil is over no country will even look at them.
1900 2018-05-11 19:42:30 Decretaron la quiebra de Oil combustibles. A remate y a devolver lo robado. Ah, sigue C5N.
1901 2018-05-11 19:42:28 Worst kind of hypocrite.  Doesn't do anything to reduce his personal carbon footprint but judges using manipulated facts.  Oil & gas is needed for a very broad range of industries & manufacturing.  Mr Gore stay home & stay out of Canada's affairs!
1902 2018-05-11 19:42:22 Luxembourg is one of the wealthiest and tiniest countries on earth: 600,000 people on 1000 square miles of territory. Of course, they have plenty of money for teachers! So do the Arab oil emirates.

1913 2018-05-11 19:41:33 Oil, full stop.
1914 2018-05-11 19:40:53 You’ve got to be kidding. Ethics and the Senate, they go together like oil and waters.  John McCain said we could go to hell if we didn’t like him trying to overthrow a duly elected President.
1915 2018-05-11 19:40:51 Am I wrong for wanting to go to the bar across the street while I wait for my oil change lol

1918 2018-05-11 19:40:40 Probably wouldn't have happened if oil was in a pipeline and not on a rail car. Safer and cleaner in a pipe.

1924 2018-05-11 19:39:56 That is because the Russians ordered him to break the agreement so oil prices would rise. Trump doesn’t report to Americans.
1925 2018-05-11 19:39:30 The Dumpster is invested in Oil ,gas just like Russia ,lining them pockets
1926 2018-05-11 19:39:03 Yes shale gas & oil is serious stuff! And I've heard that shale gas is the main reason for US being the only nation that actually have managed to cut CO2 emmision. EU more or less flat and China & India increasing big time.

1939 2018-05-11 19:37:18 My argument for the claim is mainly an energy/peak oil argument
1940 2018-05-11 19:37:17 You can also put some sugar in a spoonful of olive oil, it helps a lot
1941 2018-05-11 19:36:56 With $200 million in the bank, he does not care too much about the oil tankers that drive by his $9 million California beach house every day either.

1948 2018-05-11 19:35:53 Well let's see. First the earth cooled. And then the dinosaurs came, but they got too big and fat, so they all died and they turned into oil. And then the Arabs came and they bought Mercedes Benzes. And Prince Charles started wearing all of Lady Di's clothes. I couldn'tbelieveit.
1949 2018-05-11 19:35:44 Yes please 
1950 2018-05-11 19:35:28 and there is nothing they can do about it; just love the oil money.
Absolute bargain for Sheikh Mansoor. 
He bought Man city for 200k and made it a super power. (future business)
United was sold for more than 700k+loans. I must say very expensive archive library. (history museum)
1951 2018-05-11 19:35:23 Will the recognition of the Golan Heights as part of sovereign Israeli territory be Trump's next move? Would leave Cheney and Murdoch's oil and fracking company a free reign to tear it up looking for oil and gas.
1952 2018-05-11 19:35:21 Which is why Trump is opposed to higher oil prices... less discretionary income = (after subsequent domino effects) slower GDP growth

1957 2018-05-11 19:34:32 Put more oil
1958 2018-05-11 19:34:21 And because Russia needed a boost in price for their oil.
1959 2018-05-11 19:34:20 So are Fuel Prices by the Big Oil Industry, like the Pharmaceutical Industry they are gouging the American consumers, using every reason imaginable for their actions to raise costs w/No oversight.

1967 2018-05-11 19:33:06 This is flat out false. The "oil economy" of Texas has been gone since the 80s. It only accounts for a modest portion, and only really in Houston and Dallas.

What happened in West TX isn't at all representative. Our environment is well managed, and we actually reject much fed $

1972 2018-05-11 19:32:43 so just like the price of oil and insurance?
1973 2018-05-11 19:32:28 My tip is to only wash twice a week and use a weekly hot oil treatment to keep things glossy. I also never blow dry 
1974 2018-05-11 19:32:27 Great news! Can you promote adding Hemp oil to our insurance prescription list?
1975 2018-05-11 19:32:20 .@Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
1976 2018-05-11 19:32:20 Either way, I'm grateful because God is awesome, and until you know that cost of the oil, your opinions and feelings about me are null and void. You may have your issues, but those are YOUR issues. Jesus thinks I'm worth it  and that's enough for me 
1977 2018-05-11 19:32:19 Here in Brasil we had Eike Batista a famous oil billinaire that did almost the same thing. But he is already broken.
1978 2018-05-11 19:32:14 It takes more oil to put ethanol gasoline than it does to just use gasoline.
1979 2018-05-11 19:32:09 Truth, especially since McD’s switched from beef tallow to vegetable oil for cooking the fries
1980 2018-05-11 19:31:49 They wooded Bush and Obama. Nothing changed in our sickening relation with SA even after their involvement in 9/11. We sell arms, purchase oil, support atrocities in Yemen, ignore violation of human rights against their own citizens, our political & biz elite in love wi MBS.
1981 2018-05-11 19:31:46 Please, Mr. President, We need help on the price of oil.  It's killing us.
1982 2018-05-11 19:31:01 Yes, am aware of that. What's his view of OPEC and the new head of Saudi Arabia? Should they be taking SaudiAramco public? Might affect oil prices here.
1983 2018-05-11 19:30:49 Dreams and floating ideas. Talk is cheap. The Iranians are no push over. America too will bleed this time  real bad  and Israel and the Saudi's. And the Oil companies will smile to the banks

1988 2018-05-11 19:30:18 Estuve ausente durante todo el día pero me juego la cabeza a que algún pelotudo salió a decir que la quiebra de Oil Combustibles se decretó para tapar lo del dólar.

1992 2018-05-11 19:29:47 So far everything he’s done has driven up prices, the latest being the price of oil. We will be paying more for ch more for gasoline as well as food & other goods due to rising cost of transporting them. & don’t forget the tariffs also causing rising costs.
1993 2018-05-11 19:29:45 Posting about how u can’t put coconut oil u get at the grocery store on ur face is something I’m gonna have to do often
1994 2018-05-11 19:29:38 The answer is hydrogen, most plentiful resources on earth. When the hydrogen is used the waste product is oxygen therefore absolutely no pollution. It is my understanding that this technology has been known to us since the late 1800's. Big oil bought up the technology and buried
1995 2018-05-11 19:29:27 For Trump &his 2most valued allies, Israel & Saudi Arabia, Iran nuclear accord problem wasn't mainly nuclear. It legitimized &normalized Iran’s clerical  gov., reopening it to world economy w oil $ financing its adventures in Syria & Iraq, missiles, & terrorist support. (NYTimes)

2000 2018-05-11 19:29:04 I kept telling people the price was going up. You got to look with everything he does WHO makes money from it. That will tell you every thing Russia going to make money off their oil.
2001 2018-05-11 19:29:03 That's the whole point of it.  Destabilize the Middle East so Russia can exert more influence there.  Plus, more turmoil always seems to equal higher oil prices, which again helps Russia.  Saudis, too.  Money to be made from chaos.
2002 2018-05-11 19:28:55 Data is as valuable as oil.
2003 2018-05-11 19:28:37 Good newsletter. 
Can you check into the Geni Oil company and their interest in the Golan Heights?
Thank you!
2004 2018-05-11 19:28:25 I feel you , you are a strong #LupusWarrior please look at my website and try cbd oil.  It does really help. Im not just pushing a product... trying to help others with chronic illness.
2005 2018-05-11 19:28:20 I’m reminded of the time I was on a Scotland-London train when some passengers from north of the border shouted ‘skellies’ every time we passed fields of oil seed rape.
2006 2018-05-11 19:28:16 Shoutouts to baking soda and peppermint essential oil.
2007 2018-05-11 19:27:51 海外お疲れ様です！！
2008 2018-05-11 19:27:51 No. It wasn't. Really. You need to listen to some new music, buy a jumper and start vaping some oil. Today. Its fucking beautifully out here on the edge of a new world. Nostalgia is a sad thing for people who r done. Dont b done.
2009 2018-05-11 19:27:42 I will never buy a gmc again! Does sales brocure say they will lose 2 quarts of oil in between changes?

2016 2018-05-11 19:26:55 If we can afford the fuel oil post-Brexit !!!!
2017 2018-05-11 19:26:50 It doesn't take even a student of economics to realise you are talking rubbish. If Scotland doesn't get revenue from oil & is still part of U.K. with no powers to make changes to how oil is managed, how on earth is this even slightly relevant? 
2018 2018-05-11 19:26:33 I actually just use ORS jojoba oil on my nails :) intended for hair but they’re made of the same stuff x
2019 2018-05-11 19:26:30 All other countries should block imports from America. Oil, defence equipment, electronic goods, ...
2020 2018-05-11 19:26:27 Nah if it were a terrain it they would be out putting oil in it, because of how much they use!

2027 2018-05-11 19:25:45 Since denying Germany the OIL in WWII, we have been the insurgents and terrorists invading the Middle East to control who is allowed to buy it and who is bankrupted by the price.
2028 2018-05-11 19:25:41 If you want to stop pipelines, reduce your oil usage, vote with your dollars. Use electric cars and put solar on your roof. If you can’t totally ditch fossil cars, buy a used Leaf for $8k and keep your fossil car for longer trips.

2031 2018-05-11 19:25:32 oh, one other think ..... when plated, drizzle a bit of olive oil, also can top with grated/shaved parmasian, red peperoncino flakes, black cracked pepper .... mangia
2032 2018-05-11 19:25:25 First day using castor oil on my eyelashes and brows, let’s see if this actually does anything
2033 2018-05-11 19:25:21 Never again will I buy gmc! Does their sales brocure say that you could use 2 plus quarts in between oil changes? Mine did not, and mine does!
2034 2018-05-11 19:25:17 tea tree oil will help it go away fast asf put it on before you go to sleep and when you wake up

2038 2018-05-11 19:24:54 It could be the oil coming into the motor.  Do you have flow to the inlet and outlet of the motor?
2039 2018-05-11 19:24:53 millions of Iranians ? are you delusional ? #Iran is one of the major providers of oil and every Iranian receives monthly income from government . the fact is that most people are victims of abuse of their rights. this money could've been spent on making better schools

2043 2018-05-11 19:24:26 It is what a society is used to saying.  Russians like oligarch.  We use a softer term.  We don't use the term oil baron anymore. We use soda or pop depending on where you live but it is still the same thing, not a biased opinion.  They are no less oligarchs here than in Russia.
2044 2018-05-11 19:24:12 Olive oil and oregano...am I really cooking that much italian food?
2045 2018-05-11 19:24:11 Apply a product containing salicylic acid directly to pimples to absorb oil and reduce size.
2046 2018-05-11 19:24:09 Because people walked great distance and lined up at snake oil dispensers didnt validate snake oil. What an empty pro vax statement you make.
2047 2018-05-11 19:24:01 tbf, "right back" did take three years.

Gas prices have a LOT of moving parts.  When "shambles" stopped being dominating (2011), the other compoenents re-gained (pre-2008) influence, each influencing again.

If it was JUST Brent = US GDP, oil futures would have *way* less risk.
2048 2018-05-11 19:23:58 Boss struggling to get the key into my money box
me: you really need to put oil on that thing
boss: nah, the only thing I'm oiling is my ripped body
2049 2018-05-11 19:23:53 True, but its the British. Half this country has no idea how to behave. The Spanish can drink at their airports too, but they know how to. Italians are allowed to drink on oil rigs (or used to anyway).
2050 2018-05-11 19:23:51 Is it using oil? A gmc with this many miles?
2051 2018-05-11 19:23:47 @NorwichCityFC you give jerome the service he score goals but oh no we sell him and keep nelson I dont want be here olive oil

2059 2018-05-11 19:22:33 Bought the natural peanut butter. The stuff with oil on top you gotta stir up. Thought..."f#*k this" and put it in the Ninja...ya...how ya think THAT went?!
2060 2018-05-11 19:22:31 So then—is the gap b/c oil patch jobs are high paying and generally male positions? Is there a way to correct that?
2061 2018-05-11 19:22:17 Due to a mix of falling interest rates, the lack of environmentalism (They emit ~20% more CO2) and the fact they have massive oil reserves.
You're comparing a country that should massively outperform us that doesn't, and comes behind its liberal neighbours i.e Norway.
2062 2018-05-11 19:22:08 i need an oil change
2063 2018-05-11 19:21:51 Shrink acne by placing a wrapped ice cube on it and leave it on the pimple for 3 minutes. Then cover it with a dab of lavender oil.
2064 2018-05-11 19:21:38 Thanks guys.  I may hold my oil until Mon and then dump it upon signs of exhaustion as EK seems to always be right.  Yes Michaels - on TVIX - you said EK mentioned SPY possible high on the Tues. so that would match.
2065 2018-05-11 19:21:36 Sam: hey Bucky! Come run in here and get y’all plums!!

Bucky: *runs in and slips on the oil and breaks the stove*

Sam: Oh SHIT
2066 2018-05-11 19:21:32 Better stop and check oil before you start! Uses way to much! Mine is a 4 cylinder and they say it can use up to 2 quarts between oil changes! I would hate to know what this monster uses!

2070 2018-05-11 19:21:17 Do you mean the illegally occupied Golan Heights where the criminals in @Israel are illegally leasing out Syria' oil? How about when @Israel stole Syria' water in the 50's & massacred 60 Palestinians? That is when Eisenhower censured them. Thugs in the sandbox.
2071 2018-05-11 19:21:11 Workout done, hair washed... doing a hot oil treatment now.
2072 2018-05-11 19:21:01 I like olive oil,  does that count?

2075 2018-05-11 19:20:45 Meanwhile WA has a massive deficit after a ten-year oil/gas/mining boom. At what point do we jail these incompetents?
2076 2018-05-11 19:20:39 Hi  I have low porosity hair and I have to put oils in my hair everyday for my hair to be moisturized. Do you have an suggestions on moisturizers/oils to use ? Or just things that will help so I won’t have to constantly oil my scalp everyday
2077 2018-05-11 19:20:10 oil prices*
2078 2018-05-11 19:20:07 Omg why is it so hard to drop sugar and oil ughh 
2079 2018-05-11 19:20:03 I would LOVE it if we could do that. But there are still far too many people who believe the oil tycoons (and those on their payroll) when they say climate change isn't real, and pitch a fit about absorbing the initial cost of going solar/renewable.
2080 2018-05-11 19:19:43 People of Twitter, who is taking CBD oil and what is it helping you with? #CBDoil #cannabinoids
2081 2018-05-11 19:19:21 @AldiUK hey, what’s your policy on the use of palm oil in products sold in your stores?
2082 2018-05-11 19:19:15 Does it turn without oil in the lines?
2083 2018-05-11 19:19:14 You're right. We all should walk away from our hot pot meals with stained shirts and chili oil in our hair. I'm starting a trend.
2084 2018-05-11 19:19:09 You left out how much oil prices actually increased. Then you would see how rediculous this article is. A “3 year high” is almost meaningless.
2085 2018-05-11 19:19:03 อยากเป็น1ในนั้น

2089 2018-05-11 19:18:38 U.S. active oil rig count up 10 to 844. This is heading to 1,000+ if prices stay here. Be careful bulls. $USO #OOTT
2090 2018-05-11 19:18:34 The Nigerian economy
Oil prices over $77pb
CBN sales in the FX market down by 69% in April from $1.3b to $420m
Reserves rise to $47.8bn providing over 13 months of import cover
2091 2018-05-11 19:18:29 Let's not forget that, whilst Trump messes with the Iran agreement, the oil price rises and Trumps friends are very very happy and far far richer. If, in the end, he settles down, he has made is friends much richer, at the expense of us all.
2092 2018-05-11 19:18:20 Just played through Amnesia: the Dark Descent, again, and decided not to use the lantern or any tinderboxes at all. Interesting trivia: finding all the oil barrels in the game is enough to completely fill the lantern =)
#frictionalgames #amnesiathedarkdescent
2093 2018-05-11 19:18:04 Probably uses less oil than their new ones!
2094 2018-05-11 19:17:59 Why you mean they are angry with a high oil price? Lol
2095 2018-05-11 19:17:55 If you take a lil chunk of your highlight and mix it with body oil or lotion BOOM you have body lava by Fenty.. or if you mix your highlight with that makeup prep water spray thing..
2096 2018-05-11 19:17:46 Oh and btw didn‘t see the FIA care about loopholes in their rules last year, when Mercedes introduced their engine before the oil rule and taking advantage of the loophole.

But hey it wasn‘t Ferrari so it was okay
2097 2018-05-11 19:17:45 Remember next weekend will be crucial for #venezuela, and even if the outcome might be known by the majority, black swans i believe could happen during the electoral process in May 20th.. this is the other issue to be monitored by global #oil traders, investors, etc. #oott
2098 2018-05-11 19:17:38 Red cabbage, juice of a lemon, mint, olive oil, nuts of choice, saltanas - chop up all ingredients, squeeze the lemon, poor some oil, salt bingo.
2099 2018-05-11 19:17:36 was having lunch in a midtown diner today and witnessed a man drench his toast in olive oil... like as if he was using maple syrup... wyd????
2100 2018-05-11 19:17:27 Nothing like a fresh juice with rice flour, coconut oil, and fresh goji to start the day. xoxo your favorite young face with an old soul
2101 2018-05-11 19:17:26 I was told when I went to get an oil change a few months ago, but my car was also pulling to the left
2102 2018-05-11 19:17:21 i'll never forget the time canola oil had that seizure on ty dolla sign.
2103 2018-05-11 19:17:20 I 1st read it as Donkey milk soup. Now that would be a bit grim even with the added olive oil.
2104 2018-05-11 19:17:17 so its not about a nuclear deal, its an oil deal
2105 2018-05-11 19:17:11 This was the yuckiest tasting n smelling oil ever
2106 2018-05-11 19:17:08 One for you and one for all the extra oil it will take because it is a gmc. Their sales brochure fails to mention the 2 quart loss in 6,000 miles is acceptable!
2107 2018-05-11 19:16:56 Whoa participants selling #oil on a Friday afternoon #oott An ominous sign of things to come? Caveat Emptor!!
2108 2018-05-11 19:16:52 My aunts are sharing coconut canabis oil and pot brownie recipes over the phone rn and it’s cute
2109 2018-05-11 19:16:39 Yeah, wonder how long til Trump tries to take it for oil drilling
2110 2018-05-11 19:16:32 2/2 There are only two countries in the world (Iran &North Korea) which central banks are not controlled by the Rothchild Family. Moreover,  Iran stopped trading their crude oil  with dollar in favour of Euro.
2111 2018-05-11 19:16:03 Watched #RedApe on iplayer. Really horrific and heartbreaking scenes about the plight of Orangutans in Borneo, highlighting the need for us to curb our appetite for palm oil. Also shows the crucial rescue work by @IAR_updates.
2112 2018-05-11 19:16:02 Nymex Settles 5/11/18 - CL Jun18: 70.7 (-0.66) (+1.4% vs Last Week) #nymex #wti #oil
2113 2018-05-11 19:15:51 Kogi State is the most well-endowed in Nigeria as far as mineral wealth goes - 29 minerals. Even as NONE of that is being visibly exploited for the devt of Kogi & Nigeria,they are killing over marginal OILfields in Anambra. This country has its priorities warped - all for oil
2114 2018-05-11 19:15:48 First attempt at homemade kettle corn? Semi successful. A little bit burned, not enough salt. And kind of tastes like burned oil. But I’m still eating it! 

Tomorrow (or tonight) I will try again
2115 2018-05-11 19:15:41 #BycoBeTheChange
Wonderful & really amazing that such a refinery whose production unit will refine 250,000 Barrell per day. That will certainly deficit the oil requirements for Pakistan
2116 2018-05-11 19:15:38 Better avoid that Acadia! If it uses as much oil as mine gmc it will be a pain. And gmc will not fix under warranty!
2117 2018-05-11 19:15:36 Just came in my thought, who is ultimately responsible for palm oil industry? Is it government or companies? In both cases I should blame government because the system is there to rule and find out crime, then non of them under legal system if crime occur? So does no question???
2118 2018-05-11 19:15:29 Time to short oil
2119 2018-05-11 19:15:28 I watched all your little videos. As a former R who didn’t vote for Obama, in each instance he was correct, BOTH parties on oil spill, he inherited worst economy on record etc..HOWEVER, he didn’t insult, smear, call petty names, or single out anyone by name. 0 equivalence 2 DJT
2120 2018-05-11 19:15:25 Also if you like natural remedies instead soak cotton balls in almond oil and do the treatment a few times a week :)
2121 2018-05-11 19:15:24 I feel sorry for the Iranian people. If it wasn't for Briton and US seeking to undermine their sovereignty and control over their oil. We might have seen a different Iran today. An Iran that is a part of the worlds economy and trade.
2122 2018-05-11 19:15:21 Oil gives us back to the book is made on its levels of the dynamics This connects hyperstition or inventiveness and Rimbaud
2123 2018-05-11 19:15:20 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
2124 2018-05-11 19:15:15 I mean. Anything spicy so like sriracha or habanero or a homemade salsa picante WITH habanero (onions, vinegar, tomato, salt, oil, habanero)
2125 2018-05-11 19:15:14 Surely only oil is refined?
2126 2018-05-11 19:15:13 boil you pasta ... at the same time put pan on heat, let get hot, then drizzle olive oil in center, then take pan and coat bottom with olive oil, when oil gets hot add sliced/diced garlic, just when it gets browned/tanned add sauce, lower heat/flames to medium ...
2127 2018-05-11 19:15:06 Don’t be fooled, the US only cares about petroleum oil. We don’t care about world peace. We want our gas and we’re willing to kill billions of people in the Middle East for it.

2129 2018-05-11 19:14:55 I really didn’t know it take an hour + for an oil change
2130 2018-05-11 19:14:51 Ok A HACK: put a teaspoon of coconut oil in your bath water with nothing else and soak. I promise you’ll have the SOFTEST SKIN! Then use it to moisturise after or use a body butter. I didn’t know putting a small amount in my bath would make me feel like a babies bum :)
2131 2018-05-11 19:14:49 i don't even smell like sesame oil
2132 2018-05-11 19:14:40 te tienen algunos como un "comunicador social" gil!!!!..bajate a comprar o mirar x lo menos jajaja ¡¡ oil !!
2133 2018-05-11 19:14:28 #toughTimesUSD with Iran, Qatar, and even Venezuela having already agreed to buy and sell their oil in currencies other than  dollar, a new currency swap agreement signed on May btw Nigeria and China could mean that a fourth OPEC nation could also soon be leaving the Petro$

2134 2018-05-11 19:14:27 Great point. The Greens are like the SNP ...they change their story on a whim. Oil is great and we support its production if it means we can fund independence....forget that now cause we are opposed to fracking. Greens are pathetic
2135 2018-05-11 19:14:13 Tax parity for geothermal is better than a penalty, but energy from coal, oil and gas imposes huge environmental costs. They should be taxed more heavily, not equally.

2137 2018-05-11 19:14:07 Even a place to store all the extra oil you will have to carry because it is a gmc an will use so much!

2139 2018-05-11 19:13:32 I don’t think Russia will gain much. Oil prices reaction is muted and likely to be such. Geopolitically, yes, some gains. Nothing on Russia side of the equation that is different from China’s side, but China’s scale is simply larger.
2140 2018-05-11 19:13:18 And trump just made the oil they buy from Iran cheaper. Where was kinder morgan oil supposed to go?
Between EVs and trump, the tar sands future of growth looks bleak.

2143 2018-05-11 19:13:09 I can still recall that a warmhearted and fantastic blue-eyed INFJ oil heiress, throwing aside a powder blue blouse, is slowly trotting along without a care in the world on a confidently dirty blue-eyed cremello Belgian Warmblood horse.
2144 2018-05-11 19:13:02 @Roo_1030 get your oil changed
2145 2018-05-11 19:13:02 I loved spending lots of time just standing around in the fountain. It was peaceful. But I also love the storage room right next to it. Had lots of terrifying encounters! (Plus this was usually around the point that everyone ran out of lantern oil.)
2146 2018-05-11 19:12:55 Health Insurance. Your Auto Insurance doesn’t pay to change the oil in your car. We’ve been tricked into believing Health Insurance pays your routine healthcare, not unforeseen emergencies. Huge dead weight loss in processing.
2147 2018-05-11 19:12:45 Prepping them can be a pain and they take a serious toll on the oil, as all breaded items do.
2148 2018-05-11 19:12:30 3 tablespoons of coconut oil and ground coffee saves from the morning works wonders too and you’re so soft after
2149 2018-05-11 19:12:21 #bbcaq It's only "our oil" as the QM puts it because of a coup backed by the UK in 1953. Itanians have not forgotten, even if the UK has.

2174 2018-05-11 19:09:52 Ethiopia, a landlocked rugged non oil producing country has averaged a GDP growth of 8% in the last 2 decades.
Then there's Uganda, an oil producing country to be, where leaders think that the prospect of a 7% GDP growth is an extraordinary achievement worth national celebration.

There are many other factors that come into play that costs higher.& you can have your dirty oil investors - the world is moving on. Squeeze that last penny to ruin our enviro

2189 2018-05-11 19:08:41 A shoutout to @ChinaUncensored . If there were any way for the US to convince China to stop giving Iran money for oil, it would put a major strain on the three Iranian branches of government. I'm all for it.
2190 2018-05-11 19:08:36 KFC is unhealthy food. We need to introduce consumers to low carb high fat. Not burnt oil it's too dangerous for the body

2192 2018-05-11 19:08:32 Heather, it's time to introduce a new round of sanctions against Putin's gang. Because of the conflict in the Middle East, the price of oil has risen and the Russian economy is doing very well. In fact, the effect of past sanctions - leveled.

2195 2018-05-11 19:08:03 It has also made Putin and Russia much wealthier with the rise in oil prices. Coincidence? I don't think so.....

2199 2018-05-11 19:07:56 Lesson learned: never go to Jiffy Lube for an oil change.
2200 2018-05-11 19:07:51 Again, Mr. Goldstein, where exactly did Dr. Andrew Weaver say that “all  global oil production  is, in fact, an insignificant contributor to  global warming”? This is important.  Your argument hinges on this  premise. #cdnpoli

2214 2018-05-11 19:06:48 gas has nothing to do with your state in terms of price. Oil is sold on the spot market. It is the unease with supply that will cause a spike, usually the market can spread the oil around. However a war would interrupt supply all to the benefit of Russia.
2215 2018-05-11 19:06:46 If you could point to where I said “the oil company” that’d be great. I do work at a pipeline company. That’s just a fact sorry I didn’t use Oklahoma nomenclature as “working pipeline” lmfao
2216 2018-05-11 19:05:47 No about it. But the question is how long this issue will be roaming around our environment? Is there no end to this issue? I see thousands of people are fighting for environment where palm oil plantations have killed many of the species in those areas particularly Orangutan.
2217 2018-05-11 19:05:42 Pumping tight oil
2218 2018-05-11 19:05:40 According to @UE 'Ministry of Defence officials warned that supporting an EU ban on palm oil in biofuels could jeopardise a major Malaysian deal for British-made fighter jets, according to government emails.' Perhaps its in the hands of consumers and supermarkets ...

2250 2018-05-11 19:01:55 The gas tax has been washed through the price a long time ago. Supply and demand. Oil companies were against the gas tax because they knew the rules of ecconomics would win out and they would loose profit. That is why a bipartisan deal was worked out.

2279 2018-05-11 18:59:08 Those Democraps never bet on Alaska going back to @KremlinRussia_E cutting off Kennedy (oil) black mail money. Haha! Ambassador Joe Kennedy Sr was a Republican!!! #FDR #NewDeal goes bust not Boston lol
2280 2018-05-11 18:59:03 But in the background there is a gem , a gift that keeps on giving and is not operating , possibilities is a negotiation that does not compromise the investment because oil does not loose value and we could operate without being affected by a down spiral economy

2286 2018-05-11 18:58:15 Your child swallowed cooking oil LAST NIGHT. Has vomited twice today and you wait until 2:00 p.m. to call your Pediatrician.

And didn't call Poison Control at all.

Some days I just want to turn the phones off. Figure it out your damn selves.
2287 2018-05-11 18:58:09 I put off 5 years of vacations. I want to do it right. I owned a deep sea fishing charter business here in Florida until BP oil spill put me out of business. They finally bought me out, now I can retire & have the time to do this trip the way I've wanted to. Slow & steady.

2292 2018-05-11 18:57:46 Oil prices petrocurrency gains=Vlad gets happy. Kind of a way to somewhat lift sanctions without saying so to the public. Trump also makes $$
2293 2018-05-11 18:57:44 Isn't wind efficiency also a serious issue? Off when not proper conditions, expensive to maintain, needs vast physical land for a comparable nuclear grid.

I agree with phasing out oil and coal but nuclear is practically clean energy and leaves a small footprint.

2297 2018-05-11 18:56:53 It’s a pipeline company not a refiner hence why I say pipeline company not oil company
2298 2018-05-11 18:56:50 Nero liked to tie people to stakes, cover them in oil and set them alight to illuminate his garden at night. Nero had issues.

2317 2018-05-11 18:54:45 i cant believe boba was such a good boy and then all his bounty hunter uncles ruined him by teaching him that chewing tobacco is cool and eating vegetables is lame and you should use engine oil as deodorant
2318 2018-05-11 18:54:41 It goes to the extreme parents give up custody before they see the children turn into six year old hookers to eat , a natural rich oil country

2323 2018-05-11 18:54:10 Look, you answered an insult, gammon, with an insult, Owen is no oil painting. It's playground stuff. Who cares? The gammon thing is silly. So what?
2324 2018-05-11 18:53:48 I think she meant the loophole when Eric Holder ran guns into Mexico.
2325 2018-05-11 18:53:40 AZ skyrocketing too, but what gets me is we are usually below the national average--not this time. Special thanks to Saudis for oil reduction campaign at the same time as them wanting US to sanction Iran oil.

2329 2018-05-11 18:52:56 Our economy in Ontario didn't rebound when oil tanked because the manufacturing had already left. It doesn't bounce back like oil prices do.
2330 2018-05-11 18:52:51 I can’t smoke any ore till November so I think I’m gonna crack and get a vape and some CBD oil.
2331 2018-05-11 18:52:30 Of course oil isn't going away tomorrow or next year. But we can use renewables to slow or stop the rate of increase of our dependence on oil. Also, pipelines have proved (by leaking) that they are NOT well designed infrastructure. Or at least, not well maintained.
2332 2018-05-11 18:52:24 I came to get an oil change and they tried to sell me some bullshit thing to prevent sludge for $40. My car is only 2 years old. Then they tried to tell me my brakes need to be replaced when I just got them done. Damn crooks man 
2333 2018-05-11 18:52:24 But so true :)
Oil painting scares me (Maybe because I have never tried and my requirements are too high) . Here, the render is almost photographic. I'm naturally subjugated
2334 2018-05-11 18:52:18 If I'm doing intermittent fasting I usually just skip breakfast, but I have done 24 hour fasts before where I just have a spoonful of coconut oil whenever I feel hungry.
Also I drink plenty of water and take electolyte pills.
2335 2018-05-11 18:52:11 We've sold ourselves to the devil. A snake oil salesman came to town and now the party of family values supports a crouch grabbing, porn star dating mad man. 2020 can't get here soon enough. #takeourpartyback
2336 2018-05-11 18:52:06 But oil prices are going up because of his stupid Iran move! He will make money off that oil and nobody will know it!

When everyone on #WallStreet is calling $100 a barrel #oil, #WTI responds to their predictions with a surprised bear run which has no ending in sight at this point.
2342 2018-05-11 18:51:42 Adulting has whooped my ass today ! Tires , insurance , oil change , and some more stuff  I’m so glad i make decent money so I’m not completely broke afterwards lol 
2343 2018-05-11 18:51:33 He lies about everything. I found this to be ironic. "The Trudeau family hasn’t had to work in any serious way since his grandfather made the family fortune in the oil and gas business, running a chain of gas stations in Montreal."
2344 2018-05-11 18:51:32 -Dolar a 24? ahhh no! ya la quiebra de Oil Combustibles y el lunes que detengan otra vez a alguien.

2348 2018-05-11 18:51:13 Agreed. We get car insurance not for the oil changes, but for when we hit the Audi.
2349 2018-05-11 18:51:07 There is quite the racket going on in Africa w/ mining&oil/gas capture! Many $ going out in 4 subsidies&few jobs locally. Lrg corps sending lots of electr there to have comp stripped like gold etc due to toxic chems req. same w/ south asia. Our gov calls it trade-its not really!
2350 2018-05-11 18:51:02 I would rather vote Atiku that did nothing as vp than doing every thing in voting some one that'll tell the world I sit and do nothing than expecting free oil money.
2351 2018-05-11 18:50:57 What is to like about Oil and Coal?  I really don’t get it. Should not be a partisan issue but human issue. I don’t get those that slam renewable energy.
2352 2018-05-11 18:50:56 My daughter had low tires she asked me the non driver had to check the tire pressure and where to put more oil in.. Nice to know I’m still needed.
2353 2018-05-11 18:50:43 Yeah but #MAGA . Take a look at yourselves. We can all be proud of our country's achievements as long as the means are ethical, far reaching and altruistic, not just lending troops for a good return or turning oil into useless objects, or selling deadly arms to unstable countries
2354 2018-05-11 18:50:41 covering myself in coconut oil after every shower >>> the best feeling
2355 2018-05-11 18:50:37 So, Trumps cancels the Iran deal costing Boeing a $20B deal. Russia gets to build and sell the planes instead. Meanwhile, China gets the oil. An other win for the US economy and American jobs, I'd say.

2365 2018-05-11 18:49:38 America’s currency is backed on debt....not oil, gold, natural resources....debt.
2366 2018-05-11 18:49:29 Trini women selling avocados in Venezuela in the 80s during the oil boom? Highly doubt that.
2367 2018-05-11 18:49:18 Boleh je one fine day. But not now. No need to add oil to the fire for the meantime

2371 2018-05-11 18:48:42 Haha No longer rich son of Nigerian deceased oil king? What next?...
2372 2018-05-11 18:48:36 Oh boy, I hear you. The problem isn't a car killer soooooo my car can just continue to leak oil. I'll just keep topping it off; that's almost like a slow rolling oil change anyway, right? Right?? *sigh*
2373 2018-05-11 18:48:28 To the man who cut me off and stopped in the middle of an intersection to prove a point just to follow me to rapid oil:
I’m sorry that you think me getting into the turning lane was a wrong move, I was just trying to get my oil changed. I hope you have a fantastic day 
2374 2018-05-11 18:48:03 There is over 7 billion  people on the planet.  Social programs in this great country depend on Oil money bigtime. Your kidding yourself if u think different. Yes we have to find other alternatives but just google the weight of electric cars for starters.

2377 2018-05-11 18:47:50 You cannot be on the same page. Truth is truth, you cannot equate it with anything else. It's like water and oil. They are insoluble.
2378 2018-05-11 18:47:47 My nail oil turned out all chunky and not smooth like this what did I do wrong lol
2379 2018-05-11 18:47:32 It's all because of two factors: 

1) This region is as TRIBAL as it was 2000+ years ago! 

2) World Superpowers & especially GLOBALISTS who carved it all up in the first place (FOR PROFITS, mostly Oil), created even more chaos, and are still hard at work "Engineering the world"!

2381 2018-05-11 18:47:16 guys i have a question: i just used almond oil & it says that its expiration date is 12-9-2018 is it bad ?
2382 2018-05-11 18:47:14 no wonder Shah was ousted and no wonder the West is fighting so hard to prevent regime being toppled. China colluding to prevent regime change because it depends on cheap oil. Sunni ethnic cleansing an Israeli a side benefit?
2383 2018-05-11 18:47:02 If you want to see what Tar really is , go to the tar pits in California and do us a favor and jump in and go for a swim. $35 million you have invested in Apple Stocks, last time I checked computer components are made with Oil Byproducts. Which makes you a Hypocrite.
2384 2018-05-11 18:47:00 Oil change , gas now the only thing maxi need is an carwash

2387 2018-05-11 18:46:15 However, Trump, Cheney and others stand to benefit hugely from a war via Genie oil. Absolute carve up if it happens.
2388 2018-05-11 18:46:10 help me I entered through the exit door at shaws and my is arm stuck the workers are laughing at me I’ve used up all my butter and baby oil and it won’t budge send hel
2389 2018-05-11 18:46:09 More lies. But you fif pay. You paid eith your credibility. You will receive empty promises. And guess what, you will need same verication process as Iran deal you disparaged and tore up to raise oil prices for your pal pution and further fracture our alliances.

2394 2018-05-11 18:45:20 Just started this past week on the all meat diet.
Adapting well.
I came across something that gave me concern, which is (TMAO) trimethylamine N-oxide, which I guess causes clotting .
Also they stated some foods can counteract it, balsamic vinegar, RED WINES, & X virgin olive oil.
2395 2018-05-11 18:45:17 So condescending. You think somehow that opponents of drilling in residential areas are ignorant? Or that there aren’t oil & gas people opposed to profit over people near and under existing homes, schools, parks and churches?

2401 2018-05-11 18:44:35 Bank of America expects that #oil prices could rise to $100 per barrel in 2019
2402 2018-05-11 18:44:28 What does risk appetite have to do with this. These people were quick to be opinion leaders when it favoured them. When push comes to shove they weren’t there. Wak sells beard oil fgs. Only risk to them is if they were leeching on contracts with Najib. Which makes it even worse.
2403 2018-05-11 18:44:26 And this friendship will end badly for them. Lie down with dogs, etc, etc. Trumps policies are all about shoring up Russia failing oil output- hence Iran. All Putin's bidding. When he loses interest  Isreal will be left in the middle of war.
2404 2018-05-11 18:44:19 Helmanns white. Just the regular, not the olive oil. That one isn't white enough.
2405 2018-05-11 18:44:18 Thanks ladies  Our Avocado Face Oil is pretty great. It protects dry skin while treating the skin with essential fatty acids to soften and improve flaking/ roughness 
2406 2018-05-11 18:44:08 Trump in Putin's pocket so he encourages Trump to go to war with Iran, causes decrease in oil supply which raises oil price which is exactly what Putin wants to help his ailing economy. America is getting played by Russia and the only question is why Trump does nothing to stop it
2407 2018-05-11 18:44:05 Michael Cohen partnered with the Law Offices of Squire, Patton & Boggs, the third largest lobbying firm in Washington.

2408 2018-05-11 18:44:00 @narendramodi @BJP4India
Over 5 yrs, price of crude oil/barrel has come down (120$ -> 55$) but the #PetrolPrice is not coming down. Y is the govt leving such huge tax? Y is petrol not brought into GST? When @PMOIndia was ruling Gujarat he pointed out the same at @INCIndia govt.

2414 2018-05-11 18:43:19 I can’t help but notice how efficient the oil companies are with the speed that they can increase the fuel price at the pumps. Shame they’re not so efficient at bring the price down whe the cost of a barrel of oil comes down. #Oil #Shell/BP

2417 2018-05-11 18:42:53 Does Trump just want to help himself to the oil? He has alluded to that in the past." Meantime our gas prices are up
2418 2018-05-11 18:42:52 @ChrisLoesch By keeping Iranian oil from affecting U.S. oil prices, the price of gas at American pumps increase. Republican oil barons love it. Wall Street oil investors love it. Trump is helping them, not the American people. Iran is not about the nukes.
2419 2018-05-11 18:42:51 Got to get an oil change. As the guy pulls up with my car I see that the window is down.... I forgot to tell him that the window doesn’t go back up... I am a dumdum

2427 2018-05-11 18:42:04 I already read it but it doesn't say why Putin has invited Satanyahu for these celebrations nor why Putin is siding with Israel. I find that abhorrent. Let's face it, Putin is in Syria because he wants that oil pipe line which the Israelis also want.
2428 2018-05-11 18:42:00 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
2429 2018-05-11 18:42:00 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

2437 2018-05-11 18:41:12 There are some hipsters talking about having to get the first pressing and I can't work out if they're talking about records or olive oil
2438 2018-05-11 18:41:09 World oil prices =  WTI $71.36; Brent $77.47. 

Wow. Okay, so we're back in the $70 per barrel-range, again. How did that happen?  Thoughts? Ideas?

2441 2018-05-11 18:41:00 @ChrisLoesch Iranian oil is still going to be accessed by the European market, Russians, and Chinese while U.S. gas prices increase. North Korea doesn't have anything Wall Street wants to keep off the market to increase costs and profits. Trump is catering to billionaires.
2442 2018-05-11 18:40:43 A little Vietnamese Pho coming up - somebody gave me some instant soups etc because I wasn't feeling much like cooking

So I put on the oil, etc, and added some curry and lemon peel and a little fresh lemon juice.  Hope its good.

2452 2018-05-11 18:40:09 You can say whatever you want, show me all the AD line in the world but this is a ONE SECTOR (technology) and ONE COMMODITY (oil) market.

2460 2018-05-11 18:38:54 At first i cut out all fried/ unhealthy food, stayed hydrated bc I didn’t drink a lot of water, washing my face and ALWAYS moisturizing. I used tea tree oil which helped too. It got a lot more clear after that but I was then put on accutane in February which solved everything

2464 2018-05-11 18:37:53 Got a bottle of Olbas oil for my sinuses. I tilted my head back and snorted two nostrils worth due to its nose friendly spout.

2471 2018-05-11 18:36:23 So are Fuel Prices by the Big Oil Industry, like the Pharmaceutical Industry they are gouging the American consumers, using every reason imaginable for their actions to raise costs w/No oversight. Our Politicians have bowed down to them long enough for campaign financing/perks
2472 2018-05-11 18:36:14 I did. During Abbassid and Umayyad empires there was no oil, yet they were advanced
2473 2018-05-11 18:36:03 It would be so awesome if I could tell my car to go drive to a shop, have the oil changed, and drive back.  Someday...
2474 2018-05-11 18:36:02 Jasus Martin, you have the grand poetic way of getting over you point about Lilico. I agree with every word, but, in the end thought it was too restrained for the great gobshite, gombeen, snake oil, faith healer, tug nut.

2483 2018-05-11 18:34:31 It’s that time of the year again.. when coconut oil isn’t rock solid at room temperature. Spring is finally here. 
2484 2018-05-11 18:34:12 Finally scheduled an appointment to get my tires swapped, my oil changed, and my squeaky belt looked at

2489 2018-05-11 18:33:25 Ordered Cbd oil, time for it to make me not such an angry prick.
2490 2018-05-11 18:33:18 Dropped my car off to get an oil change and a headlight fixed 2.5 hours ago. I feel like I should have my car back by now 
2491 2018-05-11 18:33:18 Anyway, even tho I'm not a great avocado lover, it's not bad. And at least the whole thing worked. I first pasteurized the egg. Took the yolk, added approx the same amount of Dijon mustard, salt, pepper. Beat the sh*t out of it w/hand mixer, then slowly added oil
2492 2018-05-11 18:33:13 The Cruise Liners have guided higher for fiscal year, yet the stocks have come off from 52wk highs. Investors weighing political risk, Oil $, and show-me attitude $CCL $RCL

2494 2018-05-11 18:33:04 I’m flattered you think I move markets but I don’t. Second, I was long oil and then short after $65. I was long energy sensitive assets as a hedge (MLPs, Russian/Colombian equities, Sugar [ethanol proxy], and long the dollar [short Euros], I’ve said as much before.

2497 2018-05-11 18:32:44 That won't work because then the other 42states would crush us first most black money comes from the coasts and northeast other than the oil states the south have little financial upside. Plus we can't take our jobs with us so no dough.
2498 2018-05-11 18:32:38 Hi, sorry for late reply. For distie 1:1 works and even 1:0.5 works in oil carts like ccell.  We go 1:2 or 1:3 for other cons since the have cellulose wax

2533 2018-05-11 18:29:29 And if you use oil pastels and turpenoid, you can get the same effect as the acrylic combo, BUT you can mix and pull out layers even after they are dry. The best of both worlds. Two of my favorite painting are mostly that way with acrylic on top in areas.

2554 2018-05-11 18:26:31 Sure. Now, it still not a good idea and also completely immoral to manufacture and sell weapons to dictatorships, or to countries who might well be discreetly supporting terrorists... or to have proxy wars in the Middle East because of oil and markets. And then feel threatened...
2555 2018-05-11 18:26:29 I did, but the woman just said “use olive oil and call back in 2 weeks”. Wasn’t helpful at all. I’ll call back Monday and demand to be seen
2556 2018-05-11 18:26:22 Yeah that’s Oil Man. He’s also the shittiest robot master to play as since his only method of attack is shooting globs of oil and skating on it

Like they could’ve redesigned him to Not Have those massive lips but they didn’t...

2559 2018-05-11 18:26:09 Trump visits Saudi Arabia, who supported US withdrawal from Iran deal, hoping for higher oil prices. Trump also wants higher oil, for taxes.

2561 2018-05-11 18:25:46 also, avoid taking antibiotics  

things you can take instead: 
olive leaf extract 
oregano oil 
elderberry 
echinacea 
goldenseal 
grapefruit seed extract 
raw garlic
bee propolis  

these are just a few of my favs.

2564 2018-05-11 18:25:35 China knows this and when oil hits 125 India will learn the hard way
2565 2018-05-11 18:25:32 ですねぇｗ
2566 2018-05-11 18:25:29 Folks this is about intensification not total abandonment. Yes, oil is precious and we and future generations will need it, but not by wasting it away in areas that it can be replaced or conserved.
2567 2018-05-11 18:25:28 Great job Seth. Sounds like you're having a really good year. See you at Dirt Cup and the Fred Brownfield Classic.
2568 2018-05-11 18:25:25 あ、やっべ、ミスった

2570 2018-05-11 18:25:17 he is when he calls for $150 oil..it is a paid ad... a plug ,,they call it news:)
2571 2018-05-11 18:25:10 I felt the same way about oils. I’ve painted ONE oil painting in my entire life. That was 30 years ago. No desire to do another. Took way too long between layers. It was as dull as watching paint dry (literally).
2572 2018-05-11 18:25:06 Semoga olive oil mengembalikan kulit2 ku yg gosong krn shooting outdoor. Semoga aku lekas berbadan kurusan standart tinggi badan amen
2573 2018-05-11 18:25:06 I would if I could get them  #sillyworkinghours
2574 2018-05-11 18:25:03 Surging oil prices don't hurt either. 
2575 2018-05-11 18:25:03 oh yeah wasn't there a blackface robot that slung oil everywhere in that series?
2576 2018-05-11 18:24:53 I went to get my oil change and omg lmfaoooo
2577 2018-05-11 18:24:53 And stop searching for oil
2578 2018-05-11 18:24:28 Funny ass shit happened on Wednesday now that I think about I was telling my mom that once I got paid Friday which is today lol I was going to go Saturday in the morning & change my oil in the car cause the light is about to turn on any day, the light turned on Wednesday night 
2579 2018-05-11 18:24:23 WHO THE FUCK WOULD WRITE "WEARING OIL " WHAT THE FU-
2580 2018-05-11 18:24:21 China just opened a new rail line to Iran.... Washington Post today....Do you think that will effect the need for tar sand oil across the Pacific?
2581 2018-05-11 18:24:20 You're welcome. Also, OPEC's production cut in Nov 2016- a result of the low oil prices (and gas prices from early 2016)- are to blame and still are the primary reason for today's higher #gasprices
2582 2018-05-11 18:24:17 Pake cleansing oil atau cleansing balm setelahnya.
2583 2018-05-11 18:24:09 YO, it’s wayyyyy tooooooo hot for it to take 45 min changing my oil.
2584 2018-05-11 18:23:42 50% do preço da gasolina é imposto.
Petroleo é commodity. Dolar está subindo, oil também.
2585 2018-05-11 18:23:42 Why did no one tell me about the existence of beard oil?
I've had a beard for literally more than half my life and I only just discovered it this week.
2586 2018-05-11 18:23:36 Mary and I both had a similar situation getting our oil changed the other day.
2587 2018-05-11 18:23:25 Snake oil for sale!  Cures all ills!  Get your snake oil!  Just 600,000 dollars a bottle!
2588 2018-05-11 18:23:12 Know what fatboy if you cut the ethically produced oil sands that have strict environment controls you would reduce global ghg by a grand total of .02 %. But go ahead and give more biz to the russians. #idiot
2589 2018-05-11 18:22:58 Why's it in like a gasoline/oil container?
2590 2018-05-11 18:22:52 Why is Israel in Golan,syria (oil)...no border there?
2591 2018-05-11 18:22:51 You know we're in capitalism hell when I'm getting "Happy Mother's Day" emails from an oil change place.

I'm not even a mom.
2592 2018-05-11 18:22:44 Wrapped in plastic AND full of palm oil, oh and they taste like shit. Well done Nestle.
2593 2018-05-11 18:22:37 possible because of higher oil price? or by raising more debt? reducing opex?

2610 2018-05-11 18:19:54 Thank you! Your book is really inspiring . Unfortunately we live in Italy where it is surprisingly difficult to find Spanish ingredients...  Also using non Italian olive oil here is tantamount to heresy

2613 2018-05-11 18:19:11 I just saw a guy’s profile and in his bio he has the word ‘oil’ as just a standalone thing. First of all, gross. Second of all, buddy that’s fucken gross.
2614 2018-05-11 18:19:10 EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume i here?

2618 2018-05-11 18:19:02 What's the difference between CBD oil and hemp oil?
2619 2018-05-11 18:19:00 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
2620 2018-05-11 18:18:54 Is this the infamous "can't take out the overnight low buy all you can" trade?   $ES_F   or are we doing that friggin' "oil matters" crap???
2621 2018-05-11 18:18:53 I work in the oil business and  worked in manufacturing most of my life. The managers that wash out are the ones that practice the style you’re talking about. Almost every business is “high stakes” since the most important thing is the health and safety of workers and customers
2622 2018-05-11 18:18:47 i have, and i always use an oil based bleach. my hair is seriously so far gone i wouldn’t be able to bleach it for at least 6 months to a year :(

2627 2018-05-11 18:18:21 Quick tip: If you're prone to bad acne outbreaks, be sure you're washing your pillowcases frequently! It doesnt matter how well you clean your face if you go to sleep and rub weeks of oil and sweat buildup all over it.
2628 2018-05-11 18:18:19 Can't wait to see what Filthy Fred has to say about #Trump's new policies on #pharmaceuticals (companies) and insurance!
Cracking down on their price gouging. Pharmaceutical industry spend more on #lobbying than #tobacco #Oil and #Defense combined!
 #MAGA baby!!!
2629 2018-05-11 18:18:11 Like water and oil. Especially if you approach any given subject from all possible angles as opposed to basing your conclusions on someone else's opinion.
2630 2018-05-11 18:18:02 Viscously? Like oil? 
2631 2018-05-11 18:18:01 So true. Like an Italian gentleman once told me,'You fix the roof of your house in the dry season..' If oil prices continue to soar, then it's another golden opportunity to do the right thing with the windfall before we enter another low price cycle...
2632 2018-05-11 18:18:01 "I believe there is enough oil out there for it to be 20 a barrel, but the world wants 100 a barrel"..............He very well could be paid. But dont underestimate the existence of really dumb journalists who say dumb shit without evidence. Ever read Thomas Friedman?
2633 2018-05-11 18:17:51 DIY natural skincare like oatmeal+honey/yoghurt/olive oil etc?
2634 2018-05-11 18:17:45 Shocks, struts, brake lines, plow hoists, tires, oil changes, and more! Stop in and let us take care of all your automotive needs!!

2636 2018-05-11 18:17:27 What is Oil?

Oil from Dead Algae Cells

What is Green Oil?

Oil from Living Algae Cells
2637 2018-05-11 18:17:13 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President please, please do something about the rising costs of gasoline in America just as you are doing with drug pricing. The tax savings you gave us are all but gone with the gouging of oil prices. Let’s go 100% American oil NOW! Thank you !!
2638 2018-05-11 18:17:10 just bought the galore's garden serum from @BahiCosmetics and some vitamin e oil... these scars have GOT TO GO

2640 2018-05-11 18:17:04 I masturbate with coconut oil
2641 2018-05-11 18:16:59 I had a random message of someone called googlsnarf demanding his oil back. Wtf who the f*ck is that weirdo
2642 2018-05-11 18:16:59 He’s ok with California supplying MUCH dirtier oil. And the polar ice caps are still there, fool.
2643 2018-05-11 18:16:58 @Akshata022000 ain't carrot oil good?
2644 2018-05-11 18:16:56 Actually Three Words;
BUSH’s, OBAMA, CHENEY.
The three Stooges that tried to control the world OIL supply.
2645 2018-05-11 18:16:52 The Illuminati run the world WAKE UP, IT’S BREAKFAST TIME! Benghazi has nothing to do with a man named Ben Gahzi! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!

2648 2018-05-11 18:16:46 my friend convinced me to buy rose scented aromatherapy oil... and i keep buying flowers and scented candles too, my sensitive nose pff  no wonder i have a runny nose
2649 2018-05-11 18:16:40 Oil it with $$
2650 2018-05-11 18:16:34 what the FUCK i need to ask if u have a greasy ass slice of pizza do u just chow down or do u dab some of the oil off this is for science so respond HONESTLY
2651 2018-05-11 18:16:30 Bring our troops back home.  Let the elites themselves put on the war garb and do their own combat with their declares enemies for the oil and poppy fields they want to control.  We should not loose even one more American soul in these war games.
2652 2018-05-11 18:16:26 Why not build a pipeline from the OIL SANDS in ALBERTA , to the ONTARIO market, we could build OIL REFINERY":S that would be innovative and make us self sufficient.
2653 2018-05-11 18:16:17 Mar 2018 saw 566 drilled wells in Permian.  444 completed wells.  Per EIA, 122 wells*600kbd=+70kbd additional capacity withheld.  Whether planned or not. vs Bakken: 100 drilled, 101 completed & Eagleford: 182 drilled, 160 completed. #OOTT #oil #EIA #permian
2654 2018-05-11 18:16:07 But seriously, who has ever been proven right when taking the approach of “not us, change is driven by someone else” and “let’s keep going back to the same well and expect it to gush oil”. Jeebus.
2655 2018-05-11 18:15:51 All signs point to possible war at the moment though, with the likelihood of it being for regime change and access to oil.
A pipeline from Iran, through Syria into Israel - easiest way to move it West from there.
2656 2018-05-11 18:15:49 Just in my local @IcelandFoods and seen that they are the first big brand supermarket to ban palm oil from their own products. This is major steps. Well done 
2657 2018-05-11 18:15:46 Do you know how many jobs in New Mexico are supported by the oil and gas industry? #NewMexicoTrue
2658 2018-05-11 18:15:45 I hate getting oil changes. They making the oil? 
2659 2018-05-11 18:15:43 I got some oil in my refrigerator  bouta have a productive day 
2660 2018-05-11 18:15:40 POTUS- Drug companies spent $280 million on #lobbying- more than #tobacco, oil companies and defense contractors...
2661 2018-05-11 18:15:35 I recommend oil only cos you can keep layering over any mistakes once it dries lol
2662 2018-05-11 18:15:31 Energy market is up because the bets are on oil prices rising dramatically due to Trump's lack of policy in the middle east.  Can you guess who wins?  Can you guess who loses?
2663 2018-05-11 18:15:17 10 more oil rigs. Price steady since Iran deal pullout. Curve flattening. US production surging. Speculation very high. What direction now?  The market looks tired at these levels.
2664 2018-05-11 18:15:08 Something else interesting. China supports the decision but I hear for other reasons like cheap oil.
2665 2018-05-11 18:15:07 Yes, I do have #AppsurdCats who are rescues. Sphynx cats love human companionship. Their breed is described as monkey, dog & child. Think about that. They need a bath every week because no fur to absorb oil. They need human, blanket, heating pad windowsill Cat TV is a bonus.
2666 2018-05-11 18:15:03 But higher oil prices, so all his cronies are happy.
2667 2018-05-11 18:14:44 I'd totally throw a pot plant in the garden if it was legal. In MN they have it legal medically but even with that they only let you get oil that is expensive from state approved providers. Dumb, just legalize like Canada is.
2668 2018-05-11 18:14:34 maybe the real Chili oil was the friends we made along the way
2669 2018-05-11 18:14:31 #Pharma Lobby being specifically called out for spending $280M on lobbying, exceeding #oil, #defense, etc. and keep #Drugprices artificially high. #Pharma, #healthinsurance, #PBM, #government being called out for role in high drug costs in #TrumpDrugPrice speech #HEOR
2670 2018-05-11 18:14:31 Maybe that’s why Russia is cutting exports, they are just cutting out their useless oil
2671 2018-05-11 18:14:23 clay mask face wash, under eye cream for dark circles (losing battle because i've had them since i was a kid), tea tree oil for spots and scars, nightly moisturizing face mask called 'drops of youth' because apparently i'm old now (all from the body shop)
2672 2018-05-11 18:14:22 Oil isn't going away tomorrow. What we need is well designed infrastructure. Pipelines solve that issue as best we can. Surprisingly burning diesel also polutes.
2673 2018-05-11 18:14:11 Oil
2674 2018-05-11 18:14:11 Use olive oil
2675 2018-05-11 18:14:10 We're cutting out the middlemen, they won't be rich any more : #POTUS on drug policy. Drug lobby is making an absolute fortune, no industry spends more money than #pharmaceuticals... nearly 280 million dollars last year, more than oil, tobacco, defence combined.
2676 2018-05-11 18:13:54 Last time I drove past the Tehachapi, Ca wind farm, half were inoperable. They also leak oil and kill birds. Not to mention they are an eye sore.
Cali just passed a law that all new homes MUST have solar panels. One of the few things I agree with Sacramento about.
2677 2018-05-11 18:13:21 Me imagino tu desgracia! no podés ni comprar lechuga ahora que se re fundió y está preso  tu socio Cristolito ex dueño de OIL! vas a tener que hacer como Navarro y pedirles plata a tus seguidores! todo queda en Flia che!
2678 2018-05-11 18:13:21 Fried chicken tender deliciousness.  and they don't fry ANYTHING in canola oil so I'm a huge fan. They also have zucchini fries.
2679 2018-05-11 18:13:19 This guy came in tryna get an oil change during his lunch break. Um what?
2680 2018-05-11 18:13:12 I pulled up and literally ALL the dudes working at the shop started to change my oil and work on my tires  I was in and out
2681 2018-05-11 18:12:59 Spending like she struck oil!
2682 2018-05-11 18:12:32 What makes it worse is that they didn’t even try to make things better in Scotland with the oil revenues.
2683 2018-05-11 18:12:30 Tak semua muka sesuai dengan cleansing oil.Macam kulit muka sis sangat anti dengan HL cleansing oil  beli mahal pakai hrini esok naik jerawat! Jns merah besar mcm kne ggt nyamuk xde mata. For now pakai cleansing balm dri banila jer.. nsb baik serasi. #tanyaTK @twt_kecantikann
2684 2018-05-11 18:12:30 Remember, oil price spike from Israel threatening Iran burst the financial bubble in 2008.
2685 2018-05-11 18:12:25 Translation: Trump is still in the pocket of the oil and gas donors.
2686 2018-05-11 18:12:22 I don’t think this is OPINION, this is to tell is America already prepared for invasion, they want oil at $140/barrel again, and kill more innocents.
2687 2018-05-11 18:12:15 Simply cos of Buhari's refusal to renew their oil linence. Na wa ohhh. These people are never tired of free money. What did they do to deserve oil linence that I don't have or cannot do?
2688 2018-05-11 18:11:42 SKITZO needs some oil polish wax for his shoes - get it done
2689 2018-05-11 18:11:41 They're playing the oddest game I've ever seen.  The probable scenarios are down to traitors, or pod people have invaded from outer space.  

I suspect a cabal of wealthy men and women, centered around oil, are orchestrating things to rise into greater control.
2690 2018-05-11 18:11:25 อันนี้ได้ ณ อยุธยา ของแท้ 
2691 2018-05-11 18:11:13 me, last night, standing over the blender making miso dressing:

"EX-tra virgin olive oil."

"EX-tra incel olive oil."

her:

"SHH we do not use that word in this house."
2692 2018-05-11 18:11:11 He did it to make me feel bad for never changing my oil
2693 2018-05-11 18:11:05 Governments mean them harm also as they don't pass legislation to make cycling infrastructure safe from vehicles. Who would want their kids to ride bicycles in the dangerous streets? Cars and the oil industry are NOT gods.
2694 2018-05-11 18:11:04 Pipeline spills are usually the result of poor maintenance. Rail transportation is subject to human error and equipment failure. Neither are great solutions to moving oil. Maybe we should transition to renewable energy and simply not increase the demand for oil.
2695 2018-05-11 18:10:34 #RightToTry will undermine science, open the door to snake oil sales, and  kill people.
2696 2018-05-11 18:10:31 The efforts to transform the Tema Oil Refinery into a robust structure to rake huge revenues for this country has been crippled by political infiltration over the years. Instead of converting it to a tank farm, it should be expanded.

2697 2018-05-11 18:10:19 I'm making a real effort to not support those who happily use palm oil in products @asda @AsdaServiceTeam I walked away from many products today. When are you planning to stop the funding of the destruction of urangutang and many other endangered species ' deaths???
2698 2018-05-11 18:10:12 avg weekly oil rig count change for 2017 was +3.9 rigs/wk.  Thus far 2018, +5.1 rigs/wk.  But rig count usually tends to slow 2nd half of the yr. #OOTT #oil #WTI

2703 2018-05-11 18:09:36 Yes! He's using the presidency for profiteering and to settle scores with those that don't play ball. 

Even this Iraq thing, oil price is going to shoot up & someone (read Putin) will benefit from it. Then there's that fight with Bezos.. stinks
2704 2018-05-11 18:09:08 Nah I’m pretty sure Oreos are vegan soy is vegan??? But I don’t eat them anymore so bc swim suit season I’m not trippin ovr this also fuck anything with palm oil in it anyways I’m with you on food at expense of human rights should not be consumed

2710 2018-05-11 18:08:29 I noticed my republican associates tried to distance themselves from G.W. Bush after he destroyed the economy and got over 4K Americans service men killed and tens of thousands maimed. In a BS oil war. So I’m sure that will continue to be in the RWNJ playbook.
2711 2018-05-11 18:08:29 The price of Crude Oil is now +49% in a year.
By comparison, the Energy ETF $XLE is +17%,
the Consumer Discretionary ETF $XLY is +18%.

If you have an outlook on energy prices, which will be the best performing thru year end?

2721 2018-05-11 18:07:36 It's surprising how little Alberta seems to care about its own environment. Tar sands development, Athabasca river pollution, tailings ponds, abandoned oil wells, etc. Not to say other provinces don't have similar issues, but AB seems extreme while pushing its agenda on BC.

2724 2018-05-11 18:07:09 Vaseline was first discovered building up on the machinery of oil rigs. It has the word 'Petroleum' on the jar, why would you do this??
2725 2018-05-11 18:07:06 But you're always reminded the oil one works right
2726 2018-05-11 18:07:02 Ok i think if you just work on this stuff during the summer you should be fine and maybe do at least one traditional painting  in acrylic or oil
2727 2018-05-11 18:06:58 You sound like a FOX news commercial.  They don’t tell you there are More uninsured, higher deficits, higher oil costs. More racial violence, more corruption. But he hasn’t managed to ruin the economy he was given yet. But he is finally giving North Korea’s Kim respect.

2738 2018-05-11 18:05:15 Agree in part. No. 1 entirely. No. 2 - -you get too much gasoline and NGLs from shale oil; No. 3 - - Aramco has just started - - I suspect they'll rival Marathon & Valero with North American refining in 2 years. M&A.
2739 2018-05-11 18:05:04 Oil up and clean your games with me.
2740 2018-05-11 18:05:04 Despite revisionist history,  the Shah nationalized Iran's oil wealth. The "so called" prime minister was being paid by Anglo-Iranian oil co. & BP Oil to sabotage deal with US oil cos.
2741 2018-05-11 18:04:58 Do UK environmental laws prevent residential development on racetrack land? 

Where I am, a municipal airport closed for development, but the land is essentially toxic from oil & fuel dumping during WWII--I would imagine racetracks would be similar.

Might be 1 way to save them?
2742 2018-05-11 18:04:46 Yeah, our government seems to be drawn to the oil. I liked it better when government was 3% of GDP, not 40%. But we should probably vote harder.

We won a treble without the financial backing of a wealthy Arabian oil baron. How’s the treble thing going for you lads? Perhaps you could buy it next season.
2749 2018-05-11 18:03:58 Yes. Please. We are not working on our Northern oil because we don't have the technology. That was why we needed Shell.

2761 2018-05-11 18:02:49 Time will tell either way. The US could inflame and conflict in the region and walk away if they wished, leaving Europe and the Far East short of oil and economically troubled. Don’t think they’ll do that but remember it’s America first - he was elected on that ticket.

2777 2018-05-11 18:01:12 @HughFW this could be the answer to multiple issues. By getting the food giants to stop using palm oil and bring awareness to its use we could stop the need for it which saves the orangutan population and creates a healthier human race.

2793 2018-05-11 17:59:09 @HughFW we watched the heart wrenching programme on bbc2 called red ape. Without knowing we have looked into today the use of palm oil and we are shocked at its use. This is destroying the Earth we live in but the uses of palm oilnare found in all food groups with saturated fats
2794 2018-05-11 17:59:03 @realFemiOtedola Welcome on board Sir... I will like to introduce you to something called “bambiala twitter”, how many retweets for a job at Forte oil please ? 
2795 2018-05-11 17:58:58 What have they done with all the oil windfall of the past? We save up these monies for some croonies to misuse just like the one GEJ and his group of corrupt officials squandered in the name of infrastructural building indirectly pocketing such monies
2796 2018-05-11 17:58:55 How many gold ones will the Saudis buy with our money from overpriced barrels of oil?
2797 2018-05-11 17:58:54 I run my full synth oil about 6000 miles between changes, which is the advice I got from both my dad and other independent mechs. BMW, MB, VW specify an ~18k KM ~(10k MI) interval. They’re also in the business of selling you a new car once yours is out of warranty & motor wears.
2798 2018-05-11 17:58:50 It won’t.  it’s not about oil like pulling out of Iran deal  was

2801 2018-05-11 17:58:49 This is nothing but politics, railways go through countless towns and cities in this country, it was because of this one tragic incident that the railway is being moved, what about all of the other centers? Or what if there was a safer way to transport oil other by rail?
2802 2018-05-11 17:58:44 Couldn’t agree more. We can help by not buying products with palm oil. Unfortunately it’s in a ridiculous amount of stuff. Grrr.

2804 2018-05-11 17:58:40 Naa, u sound more like one. You said they're herdsmen and I asked honest questions. Just tell me you're too low on oil to answer them. Until u rise up to that stage to answer that question, ure declared their supplier of arms likr that ur brother that was caught in Benue
2805 2018-05-11 17:58:39 A WW III nuclear war would end the Globalist Supremacist order, stop all globalization, religions, time, civilization, and we can have a reset of the calendar to be based not on the birth of some person in the Middle East.

2809 2018-05-11 17:58:21 Russia is a petro nation.

2824 2018-05-11 17:56:50 Elements of that are correct. Synth keeps lubricity essentially forever. Semis use enough oil that it’s financially viable to send a sample off to have it tested rather than proactively changing; test cost is too high a percentage of replacement for cars. Fouling is an issue.

2837 2018-05-11 17:55:25 Benefit of drop in crude oil prices was not passed to consumers because @narendramodi, in a classic #ModiHitWicket, likeky got India into a fixed priced contract before crude dropped so we suffered while the world enjoyed.

Give Modi another 5 years? Ha ha.

Coconut oil is really doing wonders to my skin......
2840 2018-05-11 17:55:10 Hated this.... Seven Seas Oil was at another level 
2841 2018-05-11 17:55:05 They definitely are—funded by the Koch brothers, the American Petroleum Institute (funded by oil companies to spread disinformation about climate change), and Karl Rove’s Crossroads GPS. Check sourcewatch.
2842 2018-05-11 17:54:54 @realDonaldTrump America should have cheaper gas prices! You should force the speculators to drive down oil prices!
2843 2018-05-11 17:54:51 Katanya untuk maskara pake yang ada oil nya kaya baby oil gitu bisa. Tapi saya gak tau juga sih soalnya jarang pake maskara  barusan liat molita review garnier mw yang baru itu yang ada oilnya dan maskaranya langsung hilang.
2844 2018-05-11 17:54:43 I agree, cannabis oil is the best option although it depends where you live. I’m so sorry you’re going through this  A mastectomy yes but please forget the reconstruction xx
2845 2018-05-11 17:54:33 On tim ferris's tripling testosterone protocol, vit D & fermented cod liver + concetrated butter oil.
2846 2018-05-11 17:54:20 Agree. But tons of people think Goop is prime health media, as well as lots of other snake oil sites. Supplement, diet n alternative is multi billion dollar industry.
2847 2018-05-11 17:54:07 Oh, so you are the one to blame when it all comes crashing down.  What oil prices now and what happens to the economy.  #WorstPresidentEver
2848 2018-05-11 17:54:05 And access huge strategic reserves of hair oil.
2849 2018-05-11 17:53:52 sustainable palm oil is a fake
2850 2018-05-11 17:53:36 Oil Combustibles tuvo mas oportunidades que la mayoría de las empresas para no quebrar. Debiendo mas 18.000 Mill solo a la AFIP y siendo su negocio no pagar impuestos, claramente no puede sobrevivir. Y las maniobras del directorio fueron simplemente delictivas.
2851 2018-05-11 17:53:20 I feel such a difference in my skin since I've been using real coconut oil . My shit extra soft !!!
2852 2018-05-11 17:52:58 With epilepsy when in uk when can u have CBD oil
2853 2018-05-11 17:52:55 I got two friends, one is a Hash friend one is an oil friend. Cannabis is safer then Alcohol.
2854 2018-05-11 17:52:32 I got right in for this oil change
2855 2018-05-11 17:52:29 When Forte oil is there..
2856 2018-05-11 17:52:24 Hunnigan, could you check and see if the BSAA has any units near the oil field?
2857 2018-05-11 17:52:21 It’s a creamy texture, but I normally add almond oil for that extra shine. 
2858 2018-05-11 17:51:40 Minuto a minuto !!! Cotización en tiempo real!!! Ahh ! Quebró #Oil!!
2859 2018-05-11 17:51:39 Rosemary infused oil...make it yourself with bit of mint as well Kells....olive oil preferably. Just gently warm for a half hour, not simmering or anything....then drain and sieve as it were...works for eczema as well....
2860 2018-05-11 17:51:32 Homeopathy is a dangerous scam and all the supplements and programs its practitioners push are snake oil AT BEST.
2861 2018-05-11 17:51:21 What do you mean is suspicious if I buy 5 gallons of coconut oil, a purse made of alpaca fur and a collection of chef knives!? On eBay??
2862 2018-05-11 17:51:19 #Russia's state TV:
Emboldened by the rising oil prices, the Russians are very brazen. They repeatedly refer to "Donald Johnovich Trump," coyly say that "Russian hackers elected him, in their free time" & suggest that Russia should deal with #Ukraine the way Trump deals w/ #Iran.
2863 2018-05-11 17:51:14 Thx. Another stupid question. My chain is still new, I've ridden it in for a bit. New chains are oven baked with oil in each link, so keep fresh for longer.. Just wondering if there will be oil around on Sat in case I want to wet lube it?
2864 2018-05-11 17:51:08 I’m really about to cry. This jar of coconut oil will not open and I need to moisturize my body.
2865 2018-05-11 17:51:02 They are investing massively in renewable energy. I don’t know why Aliko is not going that way though. Maybe Man want to collect us with oil and gas refining first
2866 2018-05-11 17:51:00 Amazing how those oil prices shot up after @realDonaldTrump violated the Iran deal. Surely there’s no connection there or anything.
2867 2018-05-11 17:50:57 I am not condoning the actions of the Iranian government by any means.  I am speaking strictly with respect to their compliance with the agreement. Russia and China are still part of the agreement and will gladly pick up the slack on Iranian oil exports, unfortunately.
2868 2018-05-11 17:50:50 Guna oil dlu pastu bilas pakai air bru guna shampoo. Ye double cleanse, beauty blender pun demand nak double cleanse 
2869 2018-05-11 17:50:49 Haha yaar I’m new to it too. Lekin what works for me is:

Step 1) cleanser/facewash

Step 2) toner/rosewater

Step 2a) mask

Step 3) eye cream 

Step 4) serum/face oil/sheet mask (serums are expensive, so I live off free samples lol)

Step 5) moisturizer (don’t forget the neck)
2870 2018-05-11 17:50:34 it was for sure a warcrime,  reasons why he was overthrown is because he dropped the dollar, wanted to create the first african central investment bank, create first african mobile/internet infrastructure and sell oil in gold dinar currency. Those ideas, projects got him killed
2871 2018-05-11 17:50:22 I've never seen it. I've seen pump action but not aerosol. 
I love this little hair spray can of oil!
2872 2018-05-11 17:50:18 i second this. i’m allergic to peanuts and they fry it in peanut oil. sorry.

2875 2018-05-11 17:50:05 And olive oil ideally
2876 2018-05-11 17:50:04 I didn’t watch it but my daughter checks the shopping to make sure I haven’t bought anything with palm oil
2877 2018-05-11 17:50:04 I am using CBD oil which I find if taken before bedtime does help me sleep..It is legal and a bit pricey but ..
2878 2018-05-11 17:50:02 I hate bringing my car in for an oil change. I stay here for 1-2 hours every time 
2879 2018-05-11 17:49:58 I’m starting a new lavender batch this weekend to hopefully be able to make my own lavender oil someday soon.
2880 2018-05-11 17:49:52 UBI is giving a cut of the take to the bottom 80% of the nation.
some Sunni Gulf states give oil revenue out as UBI... are they turning out like fat Americans? or are they patriarchs looking after their tribe better than gay laissez faire westerners do?
2881 2018-05-11 17:49:40 You forgot to mention oil
2882 2018-05-11 17:49:21 Jeremy Corbyn today, talking ship yards in Scotland, offered Scottish Socialists the same as English/Welsh Socialists via his party - that WE all must drown in solidarity as long as Labour captains the ship.

The price of Socialism , well its Scottish oil.

2885 2018-05-11 17:49:16 Montana is serving like a blue print for the Putin led GOP. The influence started over ten years ago and now owns a Rep. Gianforte , 200m in Russian oil stock, and now are attacking Senator Tester with all of Putin's tricks. A green Party candidate , backed by GOP, and  Fakebook
2886 2018-05-11 17:49:14 nap, pack, go get some gas, get an oil change & hop on the road 
2887 2018-05-11 17:49:10 @realDonaldTrump Mr @POTUS can you tell me why we are slaves to the Oil rich cartels and a bunch of rich Stock Brokers as the price of oil is subject to the stock market?  What happened to the free market of supply and demand and competition of individual Companies?
2888 2018-05-11 17:49:09 @MayorSlyJames Good to see you at Hogan Prep today! Apologize for the odor outside you probably noticed. We were spraying our holistic spray made of liquid fish, neem oil, and probiotics on the fruit trees to keep them healthy and strong!

2894 2018-05-11 17:48:33 Because he had to give Israel the chance to destroy misfile capabilities and stockpiles as well as letting them kill some ‘dangerous’ fighters.
There’s a little matter of putin capitalising on Iran’s oil as well.
2895 2018-05-11 17:48:29 Greenpeace is anti-nuclear thereby pro-fossil-fuels.
Intermittent renewables = "greenwashing" for coal/oil/gas.

2896 2018-05-11 17:48:24 Tale of two countries: U.S. oil rig count climbs by 10 to 844 as Canada drops by 5 oil rigs to just 32...
2897 2018-05-11 17:48:12 We have to think about future energy.  That means starting now.  Oil and gas supplies are going to run out in 35 years.  Coal will be gone in 89.  Wind is the only step if this nation survives possible economy crash, possible war, and possible big natural disasters(GOD SAVES)
2898 2018-05-11 17:48:12 What kind of wrestling? Jello? Baby oil? 

I DEMAND ANSWERS.
2899 2018-05-11 17:48:03 Sometimes they oil the door joints when they perform other services. Could this be the smell - it is overpowering at first. If so, it will dissipate soon.
2900 2018-05-11 17:48:00 Because Manafort was working to connect Russian oil to the US and Pence is a Koch man.
2901 2018-05-11 17:47:58 That looks great! I want to start with oil paint again this summer – I'll definitely try this... <3
2902 2018-05-11 17:47:45 Why despise? He wants to get away from the oil and war economy, in fact super charge economy by properly valuing productivity, and regarding health care as a right like other civilized, successful nations do. Not exactly despicable.
2903 2018-05-11 17:47:43 @ainsIeytvchef 2/2 If you didn't see the BBC documentary last night about palm oil deforestaion and the plight of the orangutans it is well worth a watch.  I will not knowingly buy any product now that contains palm oil which is not sustainable.
2904 2018-05-11 17:47:18 Lol short term increase in oil prices is not going to bring economic stability or growth to the Russian economy. On the other hang, the real reason European countries are pushing for the deal is because sanctions hurt their largest businesses, like Airbus in France.
2905 2018-05-11 17:47:11 I be watching @HeidiGrey_ snaps like u ain’t doing it right  if I snap with me I need baby oil ..shower sex .. to the bed ..back to the shower ..more baby oil we getting messy and finna be tired as hell 
2906 2018-05-11 17:46:57 yes US can't put the entire world to ransom by declaring sanction country after country and Jack up the oil price to sky high. @realDonaldTrump
2907 2018-05-11 17:46:46 Putin is playing both sides to drive the oil prices up. Trump is a #Dotard Putin plays like a fiddle.
2908 2018-05-11 17:46:40 All of you should make sure you buy her oil...fans no be by mouth o...

2910 2018-05-11 17:46:35 My mother was constantly giving me a hard time for putting sunscreen on my kids when they were little. Same woman who handed a teenaged fair skinned me a bottle of baby oil and iodine with instructions to go lay on the roof....

2912 2018-05-11 17:46:23 Hey @FOLLOW_WITCH! I honestly feel like Frankincense is perfect at any time, it’s such a great oil. I used lavender at night and I use citrus or citrus w/mint in the early afternoon to help ward off post lunch fatigue. 
2913 2018-05-11 17:46:21 A former chemical enginner told me that you can keep full synth for seven oil changes. Just top it off with a new bottle, that "refreshes the detergent chemicals." And a new filter to clean out the oil. Synth oil itself apperently lasts forever or so.
2914 2018-05-11 17:46:09 @Datmotherf_cker say that oil working on his beard. get at me for your bottle... #HerAllure
2915 2018-05-11 17:45:58 Just heard at dress rehearsal: Now we're coming with oil.  Several people: Gas! 

After last night, let's not do anything with gas.  #StinkyActors
2916 2018-05-11 17:45:49 Changed the oil on both my babies last night
2917 2018-05-11 17:45:44 that is mean.

2947 2018-05-11 17:43:38 Although Vekselberg had qualifications that conceivably explain the choice of him to head Skolkovo center project & foundation, his status as mineral/fossil fuel "energy baron" doesn't exactly jibe w/ Medvedev's plan for Skolkovo project to "decrease dependency on oil revenue."
2948 2018-05-11 17:43:27 Either way they are paying subsidy. If NNPC is the one paying subsidy then their remittances to FAAC will be reduced, so they are cheating the governors because they did not consult the governors that they will be using their money to pay oil subsidy. This is stealing by tricks.
2949 2018-05-11 17:43:26 @ainsIeytvchef  1/2 Hi Ainsley, I love your food products but was very disappointed to see that palm oil is listed in the ingredients of your cous cous packets.  Would you please consider switching to sustainable palm oil?

Baker Hughes U.S. #oil rig count 5/11: +10 rigs w/w. 844 rigs total.

Higher oil price attracting more rigs.?

2964 2018-05-11 17:42:09 Wrong. We're not dumb enough to go fight some made up oil war. Education is essential.

2973 2018-05-11 17:41:07 Frankincense oil has a strange affect on me. I have to only diffuse it at night because it puts me to sleep! I diffuse citrus in the mornings to get that energized/focus effect
2974 2018-05-11 17:40:57 How do they make the bikes without oil?
2975 2018-05-11 17:40:46 @FiatChrysler_CA 3h and 40 minutes  and waiting for an oil change, a tire swap and an alignment. #unacceptable #CustomerService
2976 2018-05-11 17:40:45 When will it hit Trumpies that companies would still rather pay slave wages offshore. Profit in any way shape or form, legal or not, is the goal. The tax reform shock will be delayed, they still dont understand they got screwed. An orange snake oil salesman got them to buy fraud

-Preachers that sell anointing oil that is said to have ''special powers'' are
deceivers; their purpose is cash and self-promotion
-charging cash for anointing with oil is sin, those are false shepherds.

2983 2018-05-11 17:40:12 Rising prices in oil means less disposable income, contraction would hurt economy as it did in 2005-7, leading to crash.
2984 2018-05-11 17:40:11 Let me stop procrastinating and get up and get a oil change and gas
2985 2018-05-11 17:40:04 His oil is nearly scentless.
2986 2018-05-11 17:40:01 I’ve been buying and using lavender oil for various things for around 2 1/2 years now. It works wonders!
2987 2018-05-11 17:39:57 And u said it.. Where is my candle and anointing oil?
2988 2018-05-11 17:39:55 The market drives the car makers and the oil companies, and the market didn't demand ethanol as E10.  The government forced Americans to accept E10, which also caused some damage, and now the ethanol as E85 and E100 is not a cheap, widely-available alternative fuel to gasoline.
2989 2018-05-11 17:39:49 I prefer to mark my territory by leaving used oil sheets in select waste receptacles around the world.
2990 2018-05-11 17:39:40 Trump has confidence in anyone who can destroy our democracy, destroy any work that has taken years to improve lives, liberties & American Dreams, destroy the rule of law...if you can spill oil over every inch of land & water, you too can work for this administration!! Sickening.
2991 2018-05-11 17:39:38 Utiliza baby oil y cotton wipes, no hace ningún tipo de daño a la piel y te quita cualquier tipo de maquillaje luego te lavas la cara con cualquier bien jabón de cara y quedas set.
2992 2018-05-11 17:39:26 I was duped into buying a can of oysters in oil. Fine print noted it was cottonfuckingseed oil. hello trashcan
2993 2018-05-11 17:39:24 Anyone that enjoys this flavor is a fucking cop that regularly chugs coconut oil
2994 2018-05-11 17:39:16 Interesting. I've heard CBD oil can help, is that what you're on? I don't have anxiety myself, just curious.
2995 2018-05-11 17:39:15 TOR paaa. You can’t even refine our own crude oil.
2996 2018-05-11 17:39:09 Yes, in my fic universe it smells both fermented and decayed. And that's without the burnt engine oil. Then again IRL I have a really tasty Southwestern corn chowder I make every once in a while that is actually neither fermented nor decayed nor is burnt engine oil an ingredient.

2999 2018-05-11 17:38:52 Breaking now -- Trump administration will soon propose sweeping changes to the nation's #biofuel laws that include expanding program to ethanol exports and reducing number of exemptions for the nation's small #refineries - source #energy #oil #OOTT
3000 2018-05-11 17:38:42 I've been blowing my nose ALL morning. This means a cold sore is ensuing. My birthday is two weeks. I can't have this shit go down. 
Clean & Clear, rubbing alcohol, and tea tree oil finna dead that shit.
3001 2018-05-11 17:38:40 It will take years to recover from snake oil ideas like demonetisation.
3002 2018-05-11 17:38:36 Actually,no it's not what you look like that matters,I support most of the journalism you do,but I draw the line with your support of Rothschilds Zionists.Why not report on how Genie energy is STEALING oil resources from Syria's Golan Heights?

3005 2018-05-11 17:37:59 It turns out they hired a snake oil salesman - just like Americans did when they elected Trump. There’s a sucker born every minute.

3008 2018-05-11 17:37:42 The before & after photos r frightening!  They don’t even look the same. Barbara Eden never had any work done, still stunning.  She swears by Vitamin E oil. I use it & it’s great
3009 2018-05-11 17:37:17 A phenomenally bad idea.  The West  sponsoring regime change is what got us where we are today. Western governments and oil companies overthrew the Iranian government and put the Shah in power. How'd that go?

3018 2018-05-11 17:36:13 Sooo $$$$ spent on Iraq's  but those are $$$$ not spent on US Citizens in need...  Iraq has Oil, make Iraq repay all of this with their oil money or why isn't it funded with Iraq oil funds?
3019 2018-05-11 17:36:08 @TheAn1meMan I’m going to let you in on a secret. My life is stressful. I’m 1 of 2 oil & gas application engineers for my company that design & quote wells worldwide. Shows like SAO let me turn off my brain caveman style & just enjoy what’s on the screen. I see your point though.
3020 2018-05-11 17:35:57 The smell of both senna tablets and peppermint oil capsules make me sick

3031 2018-05-11 17:35:09 Fear mongering, is more in line with illegal immigration hysteria as of late coming from Alberta. Yet, the province outside of oil and gas too boorish to diversify economic portfolio themselves. It is not an illegal immigrant issue in Alberta

3034 2018-05-11 17:34:56 *Orders Italian hoagie with mayo, oil, and vinegar... opens hoagie, no mayo, oil, or vinegar, because sandwich making is hard.
3035 2018-05-11 17:34:51 So you're ok with Ineos importing fracked US shale gas versus creating jobs for Scots engineers fracking our own gas, jobs much needed after the losses in the oil sector? Sturgeon is a liar but she's right to allow fracking.
3036 2018-05-11 17:34:50 @MingGao26 @LouiseMensch @20committee Hi chaps. Quick question - what do you think the odds are that Russian collusion aims were to overturn Iran deal and reintroduce a buoyant oil market? Is it mission accomplished for @PutinRF_Eng ?
3037 2018-05-11 17:34:49 That's what CBD oil does! LOLOLOLOL
3038 2018-05-11 17:34:44 I got coconut oil argon oil tea tree oil lnfao but my dick don’t be ashy especially not in no dick picks
3039 2018-05-11 17:34:41 eu fico tão impressionado com essas coisa:

"Some of the commodities traded in the Lake Geneva region

35% of the world’s cereals and oilseeds
50% of the world’s coffee
50% of the world’s sugar
35% of the world’s rice
35% of the world’s oil"
3040 2018-05-11 17:34:39 That’s the way to stop them, keep antagonizing their organization. What if we just stepped outta the Middle East and stopped trying to control their oil for our own gain. Maybe if we didn’t create a war scene in their home country then they wouldn’t have these “terror” groups.
3041 2018-05-11 17:34:35 This makes me SO happy!! Are you still using that Sunday Riley oil??
3042 2018-05-11 17:34:33 Maybe they all hang out with great guy, Joe Arpaio. 

Republicans circa 2018 under thrse ppl, Joe Arpaio is great and John McCain sucks. Everything you need to know about their character right their. Snake oil selling liars.

Joe Arpaio.
3043 2018-05-11 17:34:19 The businessman that owns my oil change/inspection/tune up shop is helping me learn Arabic. I love hearing him speak the language and asked for his help. He willingly complied!!! I am thrilled that I have this learning opportunity!!!
3044 2018-05-11 17:34:16 Yea it was like real life gta. Haha. But that sounds dope. One of my friends put white rims on his gsxr, it looks tough. I’m thinking of doin some mods too like carbon fiber mud guards, red chrome oil reserves n new taillight. Smh it’s not cheap tho haha

Those were his promises n he even gave them dates as of wen it will be effective.
3059 2018-05-11 17:31:58 In these days iran was under Oil sanctions & couldnt sell their iol which its economy was related in it. ISIS was the most richest terrorist group in all the world answer me who was buying this oils? & why isis want under oil sanctions?!

3071 2018-05-11 17:30:40 Hands down always buy @Bertolli . The best quality money can buy and they have the highest standards when it comes to their products! My nonna refuses to believe that any other olive oil is as good and you know she’s always right lol

Please and thank you !
3073 2018-05-11 17:30:07 Russia needs oil price to go up to help ailing economy,  make Iran think they will support them in a war against US but tell Trump they won't... war with Iran affects oil supply.. price goes up Russia happy #Resist

3080 2018-05-11 17:29:43 Trump pulling out of the IRAN deal was all designed to help Putin's economy and get a that Artic oil .... nothing more.
3081 2018-05-11 17:29:26 Hated this so much. The taste of raw oil 
3082 2018-05-11 17:29:25 Seasonal depression is very real, first warm day off in Boston since I’ve been back from vacation and I’ve already got an oil change, picked up the laundry, paid bills, installed my ac and folded all my clothes

3086 2018-05-11 17:28:50 Turmeric is anti-inflammatory, more effective than steroids, with no side effects, and it also helps massively with pain. It is fat soluble and thus needs to be consumed with fat/ oil. I dealt with a fibula fracture & dislocated ankle without painkillers & only consumed turmeric.
3087 2018-05-11 17:28:40 U.S. Rig Count is up 13  rigs from last week to 1,045, with #oil rigs up 10 to 844, #natgas rigs up 3  to 199, and miscellaneous rigs unchanged at 2
3088 2018-05-11 17:28:32 There is deforestation-free palm oil? Great! I have been completely avoiding all palm oil.
3089 2018-05-11 17:28:30 @MSGRIDIRON I’ll be purchasing that lemon grass oil spray ASAP.... I get attacked while walking my dog! I heard vanilla extract works too.
3090 2018-05-11 17:27:52 Same. I add a little paprika to the oil--deepens the color and tastes great.
3091 2018-05-11 17:27:18 I gotta wash my car and get an oil change.
3092 2018-05-11 17:27:14 มีน้องมาเล่าเรื่องคนที่เคยคุ้นเคยของเรา ว่าเขาไม่ดีอย่างนั้นอย่างนี้ เขาบลาๆๆ... ยาวมาก นี่ฟังนะแต่ไม่ได้เกลียดตาม เพราะสิ่งที่เราเจอกับสิ่งที่มันพูดไม่เหมือนกัน เขาไม่ดีในสายตามึง แต่ตอนอยู่กับกูเขาดี ทุกวันนี้ก็แบบเดิม
3093 2018-05-11 17:27:14 With oil    
3094 2018-05-11 17:27:10 Pulling out of the Iranian Deal may put a small dent in world oil supplies. However, Trump cannot stop the Chinese from buying all the Iranian oil they want. But, by restricting Iranian oil import to the US, the US producers benefit from less competition.
3095 2018-05-11 17:27:01 A little us centric. Us has surprised to upside but rest of world not looking so good and OPEC spare capacity ain’t that much. To actually get capex generally humming you need higher oil or a lot less backwardation

¿Crees que si @cambiemos logra una re elección presidencial
en el 2019 le estaría dando la estocada final al Peronismo?
3098 2018-05-11 17:26:25 Oil him down? Shiiit..I'd use him as my own personal stripper pole!.
3099 2018-05-11 17:26:20 Ah yes, I do that too.  I rub it in olive oil and a garlic paste and roast.
3100 2018-05-11 17:26:12 This a refurbished refinery which blewup during testing 2 years back.Iranian Oil products like diesel are being imported from Dubai by several oil supply companies and shown as produced by BYCO.Its pure profiteering in name of BYCO.Iranians have no option but sell oil in Dubai.
3101 2018-05-11 17:25:52 Getting an oil change!
3102 2018-05-11 17:25:35 choo choo ?
#USOP RNS : 'Eblana-3 will be completed and tested using a more suitable rig and after obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals'
well at the speed McBlarney took for last permit that'll be another 6 months away at least 
BTW oil stains ain't no certainty of a FLOW
3103 2018-05-11 17:25:34 I have a KISS Duvet cover and oil change tool kit
3104 2018-05-11 17:25:22 Oh I got the oil 
3105 2018-05-11 17:25:10 The lips of a loose woman are like a dripping honeycomb and her voice is smoother than oil. #Proverbs 5:3 #Bible #wisdom #quote
3106 2018-05-11 17:25:01 Just took a dump that smelled like 80W/90 gear oil.  What the hell is Linda feeding me?
3107 2018-05-11 17:25:00 ...and he was paid $10M more than all those OTHER extras too! Even the men! Ye gods and little fishies! Arm the battlements! Heat the oil! Fechez la vache! We shall taunt you a second time!
3108 2018-05-11 17:24:59 That's a myth re:  the tax cuts; I've seen no real difference. I know gas prices are based on extraneous factors (i.e. OPEC, crude oil, wars/conflicts), and I was being slightly facetious. But you seriously believe pulling out of the Iran Deal didn't lead to gas price increases?
3109 2018-05-11 17:24:55 Yo keme kon gas oil la de figo de Portugal a los 5 minutos de su presentación jajajajaja
3110 2018-05-11 17:24:54 I got youuu, you supply the oil I got the hands!
3111 2018-05-11 17:24:51 Where do you stand on it? I voted for rapeseed oil
3112 2018-05-11 17:24:45 Ugh my hair thicc af. Jojoba oil is the only thing that can tame it thank god
3113 2018-05-11 17:24:38 Is oil 1 or 2? It’s the oi sound that messes it up; it kinda flows into the next letter.
3114 2018-05-11 17:24:23 they serve to strenghten other tastes. not to be eaten on their own.
have you ever had hot carrot slices with bits of onion and olive oil? that's fucking unbelievable
3115 2018-05-11 17:24:18 they vacuumed my car when i got my oil change lol thank god. i didn’t have the energy to do it.

3123 2018-05-11 17:23:22 Coconut oil and pony tails....or braids.
3124 2018-05-11 17:23:17 My stomach has been so itchy lately...since bubs is growing a half pound each week and getting bigger every day...I put on some CBD oil and the relief is magical.  
Highly recommend it for prego bellies
3125 2018-05-11 17:23:15 They really put baby oil on the stairs
3126 2018-05-11 17:23:03 Seattle (WA) Times-Business: US stock indexes veer mostly lower; oil down
3127 2018-05-11 17:22:57 In Norway there are very few products with palm oil, as they simply will not buy them on principle. We could do with that same awareness here.
3128 2018-05-11 17:22:52 อยากบอกแล้วนะ 
3129 2018-05-11 17:22:48 Me and co-worker go out for lunch.

Co-worker: Why is there a name tag for someone named Anthony on your car floor?

Me: I think that was my service technicians name when I got my oil change. I think he used it to clip my paperwork together.
3130 2018-05-11 17:22:46 Ok what did you use your State Dept kickback money for? $500K from Russian Oil company for our uranium would feed a lot of kids. You have a compassionate and generous persona in public but quite the greedy capitalist in private
3131 2018-05-11 17:22:42 I gotta replace my tire, get an oil change, buy stuff for my cat for the trip, rent the uhaul, PAY FOR U-HAUL TO PUT A HITCH ON MY CAR, and pay for gas + hotels there. Rip
3132 2018-05-11 17:22:36 For #TXGovDebate:
With skyrocketing oil prices, why isn’t the Texas Permanent Fund properly funding education?
3133 2018-05-11 17:22:22 Last night I just used canola oil. You want to make sure you use an oil with a high smoke point or else you get a very bad flavor and very stinky house (and greater fire risk)
3134 2018-05-11 17:22:19 Good night it was late-night. Bed. Goodnight everyone. Long weekend and baby oil. You like people who had to paint the greatest tragedy
3135 2018-05-11 17:22:19 The oil market is about to get scary - CNNMoney
3136 2018-05-11 17:22:13 I didn’t know that! I put coconut oil in my hair sometimes but i don’t see a difference lol
3137 2018-05-11 17:22:02 SOS different day....always knee jerk speculators making mountains from mole hills...plenty of oil!!!!
3138 2018-05-11 17:22:00 Last night a bottle of sesame oil broke in my car and wow you might think it would be nice to have a sesame scented car but GOLLY ITS NOT
3139 2018-05-11 17:21:51 Mengusap hidung dgn baby oil sebelum tidur dapat membuat komedo berkurang...
3140 2018-05-11 17:21:22 Wash your face with whatever your face can handle, then 91% alcohol (which WILL dry your face out) and an oil free moisturizer.
3141 2018-05-11 17:21:21 A guy fell down while oiling himself from a ten story building..he didn't die..why? 
Cuz he was using parachute oil.(don't kil me)
3142 2018-05-11 17:21:14 Dice AliciaK que con respecto a la primicia de la quiebra de "Oil Combustibles" de su amigo Cristobal Lopez, ELLA quebro 1ro #SantaCruz despues de 27 años de Gbno K! #BuenViernes
3143 2018-05-11 17:20:54 but the high price of oil and gasoline gonna put a halt on the economy soon
3144 2018-05-11 17:20:52 I honestly don't see nothing wrong what the hell they talking about women comes in all shapes and sizes matter fact when I grow up women had a lot of shape to him know they want to look like olive oil and a model I don't think that's attractive I think they should have shaped
3145 2018-05-11 17:20:43 Yeah, but it’s really about Islam. People fuq everything up. It makes sense that the elite are the majority & who own the oil. The Catholic Church had power wars too. When I was in Lebanon I learned Christians slaughtered thousands of Muslims in the 80’s. It’s crazy on all sides
3146 2018-05-11 17:20:39 @Dough_and_Oil bagels on Deliveroo  #BringBackPirlo and create a #Buffon

3148 2018-05-11 17:20:29 Tartuffe ! Mr Trudeau doesn't know what is going on in Canada ! The infamous Pipeline project, over-exploitation of the forests, oil sand development, absolutly harmful to the environment. , and so on ....
3149 2018-05-11 17:20:29 Um woah. What kind of oil do you use for thatV
3150 2018-05-11 17:20:29 Allah Kara mana imani... May He reward u for d legacy u left in #Kwaracamp
3151 2018-05-11 17:20:23 That’s what I had

3153 2018-05-11 17:19:35 in chozo ko ye nahi pata ki chuna majboti deta hai agar sahi matra main diya jaye to or oil slipry hota hai #weekendiscoming
3154 2018-05-11 17:19:35 I'm going to use tea tree oil on my nose piercing, if it doesn't help, I'm going to take this bitch off bc IM TIREDDDD
3155 2018-05-11 17:19:33 I swear coconut oil will solve 99.9% of your beauty problems
3156 2018-05-11 17:19:22 Quote:  "Without a regime change, the U.S. will continue face threats from Iranian forces stationed throughout the region, including in Iraq,  Yemen, Syria, and Lebanon."  

Huh?  Iranian forces threaten U.S.?   Are we being invaded?   Oh wait...Oil, Dollar hegemony.  Got it.
3157 2018-05-11 17:19:08 Akala, the only HUMAN on the @BBCAnyQuestions Panel, last night! How to expose the heartless Robots, the Snake oil Salesman, the Spanish Tory in words! More More More! Akala ...He is coming to Liverpool @Wowfest 
3158 2018-05-11 17:19:03 Anything that causes energy prices to explode in the long term (e.g. oil crisis or wars) kills Proof of Work. If mining farms can't pay their electricity bills due to lack of liquidity and declare bankruptcy, the chaos breaks out. Different proof = different risks.
3159 2018-05-11 17:19:03 I’ve heard ovens are fine if you use the convection setting and remember to baste them halfway through with a light and grassy olive oil. The roasting really brings out the sweetness
3160 2018-05-11 17:19:02 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
3161 2018-05-11 17:18:57 @unknowniightmar Yeesh! Did you get the oil changed yet?
3162 2018-05-11 17:18:47 Feliz Alconada? Pensaron en los empleados? O se trata de tomar como botín de guerra de la oposición los bienes de los dueños de oil . Por que no haces la misma campaña sobre el correo y de paso doña Injusticia deja de perseguir gente y juzga a derecho?
3163 2018-05-11 17:18:40 damn it, no oil filter for the lawn mower, could just swear i bought one, so that thing is dead for a while. 
3164 2018-05-11 17:18:34 Meanwhile this so-called "policy" : Syrian army gets weaker in combating terrorists on its soil&tensions are artificially maintained in order to get oil/gas prices soar (which will benefit, among others, Aramco's introduction on the market).This global oligarchs monopoly is sick!
3165 2018-05-11 17:18:20 
3166 2018-05-11 17:18:18 You love righteousness, and hate wickedness: thefore GOD, my GOD, has anointed me with the oil of gadness above my fellows. All my garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made me glad. #MAGA #MEGA
3167 2018-05-11 17:18:15 Jamaican black castor oil
3168 2018-05-11 17:18:08 With sanctions coming back, good luck keeping up on $oil production. Maybe we'll see 90.00 $oil after all. $EPE $DNR
3169 2018-05-11 17:18:06 Going to most likely be taking a L on $uso 14.50 call. Just didn't get the move despite oil being strong. Might've been a week early on this one
3170 2018-05-11 17:18:02 ADNOC set to supply first oil cargo for Indian emergency reserve: NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) will supply the first oil cargo for India's strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) over the weekend, an Indian government statement said, becoming the first…
3171 2018-05-11 17:18:02 As in, like Forte Oil?
3172 2018-05-11 17:17:58 Thanks Keira, I agree :-) We exchanged some tweets early last year. David Schofield @schofield72 has now completed all 24 of his illustrations for our book, the novel The Girl at the Edge of the World. They are oil paintings and we have turned them into beautiful signed (more)
3173 2018-05-11 17:17:55 It actually might be bad for me personally because I work in tech, and if rising oil prices raise the Canadian dollar it might be harder for me to win clients
3174 2018-05-11 17:17:53 It's more to do with abundant oil and cheap labour from the south Asians
3175 2018-05-11 17:17:47 @null oil
3176 2018-05-11 17:17:37 はい！全力で応援してますインテ行けるかまだ分かりませんが、新刊本当に楽しみにしています
3177 2018-05-11 17:17:31 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
3178 2018-05-11 17:17:25 Your Chili Bowl Donuts!
3179 2018-05-11 17:17:16 There’s one that I really like, that’s made with coconut oil. Idk the brand, but it was a white bag with green leaves and stuff like that. It was nice and my skin is very sensitive
3180 2018-05-11 17:17:12 Sliced garlic/onion in hot oil. Once browned add cumin and mustard seeds. Wait till they pop and pour whole thing over bubbling pot of dhal so everything sizzles. Fresh coriander.
3181 2018-05-11 17:16:57 @Saudi_FDA  هل المكمل الغذائي mct oil  مسموح استيراده للاستخدام الشخصي
3182 2018-05-11 17:16:46 Tea tree oil is $3! At target and the small asd bottle lasts monthssss. And I recommend just getting an aloe vera plant that way you can just regrow it and dont have to keep buyig product plus natural is better. 
3183 2018-05-11 17:16:36 Gas and oil party
3184 2018-05-11 17:16:31 Oil Combustibles, la empresa de uno de los testaferros de Cristina Kirchner (Cristobal López) quebró y esperan que otra empresa la compre
3185 2018-05-11 17:16:26 Quebró Oil y Cristobal Lopez y de esta manera el Juez ordenó unos dias de plazo para quien quiera adquirir alguna empresa haga una oferta.
3186 2018-05-11 17:16:26 Gain money (and data, as the new oil).

When will the gluttonous priests of the golden bull be satisfied?

Never! 

Is there a higher power that could intervene and start with the first step?

„We admitted we were powerless over our addictions - our lives had become unmanageable“
3187 2018-05-11 17:16:21 Girl get u some baby oil and glitter lmaoooo
3188 2018-05-11 17:16:16 Let me guess they want to keep the oil too
3189 2018-05-11 17:16:10 Mr Trudeau don't kow what reality is in Canada : oil sand development , environmentally catastrophic, , over-exploitation of the forests, unsafe pipeline project, and so on...
3190 2018-05-11 17:16:10 Yep. Maybe one day, though. I'd like to try the oil.
3191 2018-05-11 17:16:07 i just paid $54 for a dam oil change.. NEVER AGAIN 
3192 2018-05-11 17:16:01 美味しそう(*´﹃`*)分けて欲しい、1口ちょーだいなw

3195 2018-05-11 17:15:49 ARGENTINA = La petrolera Oil Combustibles se declarada en quiebra. Desde hace días se comentaba la posibilidad debido a la situación crítica de la compañía. 
Este viernes se concretó por una decisión del juez Javier Cosentino.
3196 2018-05-11 17:15:48 I wanna give a booty rub with cannabis oil 
3197 2018-05-11 17:15:46 Whip together 3 pints eggrolls with 2 quarts chicken. Add generous amounts of Olive Oil. Set aside for 3 days Serve
3198 2018-05-11 17:15:34 @TheGooglsnarf Why PM me demanding for your oil back NOW? You aren't a follower, what's the deal dildo?
3199 2018-05-11 17:15:32 Body rubbed down in coconut oil... body all types of extra soft
3200 2018-05-11 17:15:30 Despite being loyal to the Oil.....I’m pretty fired up on the final four teams.  Three absolute newbies and one that hasn’t put a Stanley away in 14 years.  Caps/ Peg final.
3201 2018-05-11 17:15:26 Monetary policy is going to have to get a lot tighter... might be tempered by inflows from tax amnesty (rabbit in the hat timing wise) but USD 20/30% higher and oil at circa $95 for sustained while will be a proper shock
3202 2018-05-11 17:15:18 Trump may have to send in the military to depose this evil regime. Afterward, instead of pulling out, he should annex Iran and make it part of the United States. We could use the proceeds from the oil to repay American citizens for the costs we have incurred in the Middle East.
3203 2018-05-11 17:15:17 My ochem professor is so condescending. Someone came to him after class to ask about the health benefits of coconut oil (we’re in the lipids chapter). And he turned half of the next lecture into a rant about why coconut oil is bad for you and then called her out on it
3204 2018-05-11 17:15:09 Fabulous wines and Olive oil, have both at home. Wonderful vineyard to visit and lovely people too
Glad you are having an epic trip. Very jealous
3205 2018-05-11 17:14:58 Like most of their fantasies, out of date and totally lacking in reality. The Scotland’s Oil fantasy has never worked for me, as part of the UK, it was always British oil.
3206 2018-05-11 17:14:54 Better invest in a lil coconut oil 
3207 2018-05-11 17:14:39 Fred Martin taking forever!! I should have waited to get my oil changed 
3208 2018-05-11 17:14:34 I used TMC beard Oil..loved it.

3212 2018-05-11 17:14:06 This explains why we saw oil in the Nutella jar.

3216 2018-05-11 17:13:54 My dad literally arguing with me to drive my truck down to MIAMI to get a fucking oil change. WTF????
3217 2018-05-11 17:13:42 Was talking to someone about changing my oil and this random person chimes in from the back about how cooking with animal fats is killing me.
3218 2018-05-11 17:13:34 It was nice meeting you Oil!

3221 2018-05-11 17:12:48 Gotta talk to the mechanic about replacing the clutch oil with sesame so it smells better when _I_ drive —
3222 2018-05-11 17:12:41 you obviously  don't  live in Hawaii and  understand how oil effects  kWh
3223 2018-05-11 17:12:40 coconut oil
3224 2018-05-11 17:12:36 But you might want to go with something oil based or an actual remover. I don’t know much about either. I just go after it with a washcloth and call it exfoliation.
3225 2018-05-11 17:12:32 Don't let ur service centre ruin your brand. My relative was badly cheated at Kolkata China Town workshop for his @royalenfield Electra bike WB06B 9845. 2 litre Engine oil was charged but not a single drop was poured ! His number 9051319033. This is unacceptable fraud committed.
3226 2018-05-11 17:12:31 Chile RT @kissrein: Don’t let these bitches tell you you’re wack and weak for working a 9-5 when she just sucking dick and selling hair oil and always in rent court!
3227 2018-05-11 17:12:30 I have this for almost three weeks , try clove oil. It helps. Put it on the gum and it will literally take all the pain at once. It tastes horrible but this is the quick remedy that works and stops the pain for some time.
3228 2018-05-11 17:12:15 Oh really mr. Kelly. Well sr I am immigrant. Working for automotive industry for over 10 years. Can you tell me if oil separate from 2010 CC will fit on a 2017 GTI? Please take your time , maybe google it to get you the right respond . #DickHead
3229 2018-05-11 17:12:07 Taking my car in thinking I’m only gonna spend 69 on oil change, gonna come out dropping over 200

3235 2018-05-11 17:11:33 Pro tip: use @KrazyEssentials body polish before shaving your legs, follow up with their body cleanser as shaving cream, seal it all in with a body butter or body oil. Thank me later
3236 2018-05-11 17:11:10 Calling out to my fellow painters.. what’s best way to treat flaky paint over the shower... sand... oil based undercoat then an emulsion? @property_ready @leesdecor
3237 2018-05-11 17:11:06 terrible. The low oil price was the best thing that happened to the world.
3238 2018-05-11 17:11:01 @cuervotinelli te preocupa la lechuga? Y si te preocupas de lo q nos robo tu socio, ese al que le hacias las promos de oil! 8000 millones mas intereses a la fecha son mas o menos 20000 millones! Un vuelto no?
3239 2018-05-11 17:10:47 Much like WHEN YOU ARBITRARILY DECIDED NOT TO HONOR YOUR PLEDGE for a #StreamByStream analysys.  Or was it the ?

The hypocrisy on how you want to stop oil drilling off our coast but not the pipeline destruction on our land is painfully obvious.
3240 2018-05-11 17:10:44 Refining more oil in Canada is an interesting idea - let's see a show of hands who would like to invest in this spectacularly expensive venture.

3243 2018-05-11 17:10:35 well, Selangor doesn't have oil, so lets see how it pans out. personally, if Sarawak kept everything for themselves, we would be richer than now. Sarawak has one of the highest reserves in Msia, hence why project pun sampai bilion suddenly

3249 2018-05-11 17:10:17 Is it not still called weed? I never smoked it after a bad first experience, but I do use CBD oil. No THC, though.
3250 2018-05-11 17:10:15 @linusgsebastian @colton_potter @LinusTech Newer radiators are mostly portable oil-fillled ones. BUT they're actually clean - once you get the oil out. Why not drain one, put two holes in it, attach TWO pumps so there's enough push-pull to go through the radiator more easily,

3257 2018-05-11 17:09:39 religion is just an oil cache thing. crysis 1 owns.
3258 2018-05-11 17:09:18 It must drive her and the NDP loyalists nuts to keep pretending that they are in favour of oil and pipelines. I bet a lot of them secretly can’t wait to get back into opposition again so they can  go back to their wackadoodle bleating.
3259 2018-05-11 17:09:14 Not sure about that-I am guessing EU countries currently reviewing supply chain & even financing to exclude US parts & clearing respectively-accelerates oil being denominated in currency other than USD-short term gain for US-long term loss
3260 2018-05-11 17:09:14 โอเคผมนอนก่อน เดี๋ยวพรุ่งนี้มาตอบนะครับ
3261 2018-05-11 17:09:05 Essential to heat oil and add chopped garlic, cumin and mustard seeds for a couple minutes, then tip that in the dal at the end. And curry leaves are important too
3262 2018-05-11 17:08:45 We need to stop buying crappy oil on the east coast from countries with horrible environmental and human rights policies, and be able to deliver our own product to both ends of the country. Canada first!  #KeepCanadaWorking
3263 2018-05-11 17:08:44 because inflation would otherwise kill the RF economy, RF still has IMF economy, they are involved in western schemes, all the money coming from oil means its inflationairy,ironically RF can't spent it,must buy US debt..like Saudis.. lol..

3275 2018-05-11 17:07:10 I received the Belfer Center email about your Bloomberg piece. I agree with your assessment though it does overlook the windfall for US oil producers who can increase their prices without increasing the cost of production at the US consumers' expense.@OSullivanMeghan
3276 2018-05-11 17:07:09 "dressing parameters" - blue cheese vs standard oil and cider vinegar?

3280 2018-05-11 17:06:56 Take for example in 2005 the cost of gas went from just over $1/gal to $5/gal becausr the oil companies feared a shortage that never happened...the price didn't rise because of a shortage just a prediction of one...oil companies boasted record profits the next 2 years
3281 2018-05-11 17:06:54 I took castor oil last night because I was curious about how strong it was- update: it’s STRONG my curiousity is satisfied
3282 2018-05-11 17:06:38 What are the sources of these assertions? What did they have to lose when climate change was proven correct? When oil company scientists scream bullshit, they are just trying to save their job.
3283 2018-05-11 17:06:33 What about Kurdish participation in election. Can they stand on their demand for Kirkuk region with an oil refinery for ecomical support. Above all do not call them rebel groups , don't deprive on humanitarian ground.
3284 2018-05-11 17:06:29 Maybe it worked despite the fact that fish skins have oil, you don’t put oil on a burn, thought we learned that a long time ago, & u took one life to save another - speciesism so much for understanding all lives matter

3372 2018-05-13 23:58:47 When you get too much anointing oil poured on you 
3373 2018-05-13 23:58:41 Love Heather Nauert!
3374 2018-05-13 23:58:39 Which completely explains Trump's pullout of the Iran deal and other policies which raise oil prices.
3375 2018-05-13 23:58:37 Prediction oil will rise back to $100 per barrel 

When Donald was sworn in it was $31 and some change, today it is $71 and the Iranian impact has not yet hit.
3376 2018-05-13 23:58:13 For the final 10/15 minutes I always find it's helpful to sneak a little extra olive oil and salt on the pork to help with the crackling. And you have to watch it like a hawk too.

3378 2018-05-13 23:57:55 Hold on. I know you are a pizza enthusiast. But having musky Cheese Oil Smell under your nose at all times is going a bit far—compromising your microbiome and neural pathways toward some sort of pizza-human hybrid.
3379 2018-05-13 23:57:53 I take fish oil tablets as a placebo to make me feel like im getting smarter 
3380 2018-05-13 23:57:52 Lavender oil diluted has been the best thing I’ve ever found to help that. Forget the aloe
3381 2018-05-13 23:57:36 So what kind of fish oil was tested?
3382 2018-05-13 23:57:36 Pre-heat oven to 150c. Score the fat every 2cm both horizontally and vertically. Generously rub in olive oil and salt.  Place in a roasting pan with about 1cm of apple cider (or even milk!). Roast for 30 minutes for every 500g. Crank to 220c for the final 10/15 mins.
3383 2018-05-13 23:57:35 Sometimes i use a few drops of the peppermint oil with my other hair oil when oiling my scalp such a nice stimulating sensation and i can smell it throughout the day
3384 2018-05-13 23:57:15 (´・ε・`)
3385 2018-05-13 23:57:05 未だに5ちゃんにこんな事をやれる力があったっていうのが嬉しい
3386 2018-05-13 23:56:50 Лак за нокти или peppermint oil.
3387 2018-05-13 23:56:49 I wonder if, because of oil spills, Dawn dish soap says they’re proudly tested on animals
3388 2018-05-13 23:56:39 Love it so far. Haven’t used the peppermint oil but I’m sure that’ll be my favorite bc i love peppermint oil so much
3389 2018-05-13 23:56:33 面白い
3390 2018-05-13 23:56:28 Geez, Hurley you got yourself the fancy compost. What’s next? That Neptune fish oil for plants?
3391 2018-05-13 23:56:22 trump collusion with BIG OIL;   spring him from prison as PLAN B foolproof
3392 2018-05-13 23:56:18 @ran_black_ 어제 넘 일찍자서 이제 봤네용^^ 트친소 흔적 감사합니다. *^-^*
3393 2018-05-13 23:56:12 ちゅっちゅ！
3394 2018-05-13 23:56:08 Thanks to coconut oil, girls can be dolphin mammoths...hairy and smooth at the same time.  woolphins
3395 2018-05-13 23:56:01 So according to Virgil I need to heat the oil up a bit then apply it because the heat will open up my pores a bit
3396 2018-05-13 23:55:45 There's no oil in North Korea.
3397 2018-05-13 23:55:16 Every weekend after practice, full break down, clean and oil.
3398 2018-05-13 23:55:05 Exactly! I eat an avocado and two eggs cooked in lots of olive oil every morning! 
3399 2018-05-13 23:54:59 No, that's the liberals doing that, they wanted Roe V. Wade under the guise of "healthcare", they wanted endless war under the guise of peace & intervention, & they wanted an endless supply of opiates & oil from the regions where they did willfully sacrifice our Troops lives.
3400 2018-05-13 23:54:49 ちょっと騙されかけたけどネタバラシのほうもRTされてきたから気づけた←
3401 2018-05-13 23:54:47 Agreed that Venezuela’s opp is entirely in Maduro’s pocket. Problem with the $COP stuff in they are effectively confiscating oil that should service the debt  has with China . Let’s see how china responds
3402 2018-05-13 23:54:21 I SPILLED OLIVE OIL. ON MY FLOOR.
3403 2018-05-13 23:53:56 The extra $38 billion that higher gas prices will cost Americans in 2018 is not taking into account the Iran situation. That's going to drive oil prices up much more. So add 10-20% to that, at least. Probably half of the tax cuts.
3404 2018-05-13 23:53:41 Lots of leafy veggies. Spinach, kale, broccoli, cauliflower, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc. 

And I eat A LOT of them. Basically every meal I have has 2 cups of spinach + various veggies w/olive oil.
3405 2018-05-13 23:53:34 Haha! I’m so glad you like it! Sesame oil is awesome. But you’re not supposed to use too much of it. My mom would yell at me if I did

3407 2018-05-13 23:53:29 I can't even taste puff puff, the oil it releases when you eat it disgust me, BUNS for life 
3408 2018-05-13 23:53:19 Like school choice? Restricting women’s rights? EPA scrubbing science from their agenda? Oil is good?
3409 2018-05-13 23:53:10 I am curious why a country in the top 5 of oil producing countries would need a nuclear energy program?
3410 2018-05-13 23:52:55 つらみ
3411 2018-05-13 23:52:38 Very good.  Yes, Brazil is a surprise.  And Venezuela could drop off much faster.  It is just under 1.4 now but Conoco winning the right to seize assets in the Caribbean (storage, refinery in Curacao) is further disrupting the ability to export oil.
3412 2018-05-13 23:52:35 Switch to rice bran oil.
3413 2018-05-13 23:52:35 You can do it if you want to just do a really good deep conditioning and oil treatment in your hair and look up tips for blonde hair
3414 2018-05-13 23:52:25 I hope so too! Just the matter of time before we see $TSLA at $500 especially with oil going to $100
3415 2018-05-13 23:52:25  you support oil money  man city and your owners come from DUBAI!!!   Your whole club is plastic matey. If it weren't for them you'd be languishing in league one by now.

There is too much comment & not enough news I don't want to be told how to think, just the facts & not #FakeNews opinions
3418 2018-05-13 23:52:02 Lol. Follow the oil
3419 2018-05-13 23:52:00 Europe only worried about the bags of cash they make doing business with Iran and buying their oil

3424 2018-05-13 23:51:34 Oh good gawd!  Everybody knows this is about oil prices, except for your idiot followers and they will believe anything.
3425 2018-05-13 23:51:24 I shoulda known this lil ass bottle of hot oil wouldn’t be enough for my big ass head

butter or olive oil
3427 2018-05-13 23:50:38 If he's able to manipulate it, he will. The stock market has been dipping on account of new implemented government regulations and taxation burdens brought on by the trump administration, unless you're into the coal, oil, banking and (primitive) manufacturing market(s)

3428 2018-05-13 23:50:30 How about follow the money on this, the reason behind the North Korean meeting & why the US pulled out the Iran deal! Saudi Arabia is now increasing oil production.
3429 2018-05-13 23:50:30 Its oil but thanks 
3430 2018-05-13 23:50:24 350 Bay Area Action endorsed @kdeleon for U.S. Senate! The people of California deserve a representative who doesn't take money from Big Oil. #kdeleon
3431 2018-05-13 23:50:23 Where can I get legit extra virgin olive oil from biko? It's very very important.
3432 2018-05-13 23:50:20 The first step is to tell the kids they have to get to school without gas being involved, leave cell phones at home and any footwear made with oil products are are no go. See how many go to school.
3433 2018-05-13 23:50:15 Garlic Olive Oil high fat and lots of fucking I don't care where you live and oh your Karma Agreement that's 1 on da list

3435 2018-05-13 23:50:02 The right one looks like an oil painting, and since you can see a lot more detail(?) I think the right makes for a better study on how to achieve the left. That’s just me though. Great work as always!
3436 2018-05-13 23:49:56 Al Gore net worth - $300 million (not shabby) But peanuts compared people in the oil business where average is 3 billion. For real wealth distribution you should see the Koch brothers - worth $34 billion EACH (from Forbes)
3437 2018-05-13 23:49:53 That's what we did under Obama. Oil production was up 77% under his presidency. The greatest gain since we started drilling in this country.

3439 2018-05-13 23:49:28 Who hired these highly paid (senior) execs at $TSLA in the first place?
Or do you have a conspiracy theory where Big Oil placed moles into key $TSLA departments to slow down the company? 
3440 2018-05-13 23:49:26 Oh my gosh !!! The smell of the sesame oil was the first thing I encountered. Then I got a taste !!! I admit to buying the medium heat paste, but it was so flavorfull !!! My neighbor was drooling , but I didn't share ! Hahaha!!!! Thank you again !!!

3447 2018-05-13 23:48:55 there’s a wasabi/sesame/chili/peanut oil mini box i wanna get to try them out

3449 2018-05-13 23:48:38 Your mention was the only bright spot here!  Unbelievable how stupid these people are!  They believe the “Climate-deniers” who are supported by oil companies.  Scary.
3450 2018-05-13 23:48:24 Can nick stop trying to get olive oil and her shitty ass friends attention please?? @ god

3461 2018-05-13 23:46:22 Please detail how the CPC will pay for their proposed cuts. Will you be cutting the 3 billion subsidy for gas and oil you proposed? What kinds of donations are those companies making to you? Why won't the #CPC release it's donor list?

3467 2018-05-13 23:45:05 Stupid ameriKKKans, any time a country refuses to be plundered by you, you decide they need "regime change." You did that to Iran back in the 50s in order to continue stealing their oil and you're still after it.
3468 2018-05-13 23:44:59 Yes...Iran trades in oil. Was that a Gateway Pundit exclusive?
3469 2018-05-13 23:44:23 Both Norway and Alaska pit the financial costs of destroying our planet via oil production against provisioning their societies. It really doesn't need to be that way, but that's a logical conclusion of a SWF.
3470 2018-05-13 23:44:10 To all Trump supporters...withdrawing from Iran deal means price of oil goes up...which means you pay more at the pump...chew on that

3475 2018-05-13 23:43:40 70's inflation didn't happen overnight. You can go back and check the charts to see that the trend started before the oil shock. The oil shock supplemented the pain though. Volcker's raising of interest rates was a reset button, which actually succeeded in driving down inflation

3485 2018-05-13 23:41:35 The only real way to make a dent in our oil consumption is to get private vehicles off the road. Given majority of the population is in cities, PT over SOV must be made a #1 priority.

3487 2018-05-13 23:41:14 Has prices could hit $4.00 this summer.  Low oil supplies are the given reason.  Interesting that we are now a net oil exporter.  There are proven reserves of over 100bb barrels in the ground.  70% of current wells are in production.  Others idled to keep US supplies low.

3522 2018-05-13 23:34:37 Rosneft has enormous amounts of oil up north, which requires drilling equipment prohibited by sanctions. We're talking potentially a trillion USD. #FollowTheMoney.

3530 2018-05-13 23:33:17 I’m so sorry! I have added CBD oil to my pain treatment and it helps. I use the kind made from hemp. If you live someplace where the kind made from cannabis is legal, I hear it works even better.
3531 2018-05-13 23:33:00 "Service department review - amazing customer #service! Just passing through and stopped in for an oil change. Got us in and out in less then an hour. Even the salesmen were kind and #helpful without trying to sell us a new car! Thank you Hemborg Ford!" -Christina B.
3532 2018-05-13 23:32:35 By the sounds of it Iran doesn't need to state names. Those speaking loudest must have profited off of it. Bush family equals oil and that's a huge factor!
3533 2018-05-13 23:32:33 We’re obviously expected to line the pockets of the oil company CEOs again. My payroll tax cut amounted to approximately $50 extra a month. Feels like I just handed my extra money to the oil companies.
3534 2018-05-13 23:32:23 Me: strawberry martini, ceaser salad, muscles, calamari, bread with oil, fettuccine Alfredo. 

Boyfriend: spaghetti and meatballs please
3535 2018-05-13 23:32:21 Or you could buy oil exploration/production stocks and or oil service stocks and negate the impact.

3538 2018-05-13 23:30:48 Tillerson was fired.  Pompeo up on deck now.  Big oil, however, does support Trump.
3539 2018-05-13 23:30:43 Amy, the US media is not about news. There's no more Walter Cronkite. It's about 2 fires, a traffic stop, what Trump did today, and some company trying to open new oil fields. And the commercials... It's all about money flow. Darn little TV media based 'news' worth watching.
3540 2018-05-13 23:30:43 You sound like Hollie lol and it was stuck in some oil and I got him out and tried to get it off
3541 2018-05-13 23:30:42 You know it's hot when coconut oil is already a liquid

3544 2018-05-13 23:29:39 Yep, agree. Oil/gas is approx 70% of Russia's exports and makes up 52% of federal budget revenues (according to WikiP), and is considered a world "energy superpower" - and if the middle east is in discourse (nudged along by Trump breaking the Iran deal), Russia benefits. Maga?
3545 2018-05-13 23:29:38 Lmao I drove my brothers truck to town and he ran out of oil. Thanks Tyler 
3546 2018-05-13 23:29:08 More like oil companies need to prepare for declining profit, Americans won’t over spend on necessities, just ask @Walmart
3547 2018-05-13 23:29:02 I never knew there would be such a profound philosophy in snacks drenched in oil and preservatives. How funny.
3548 2018-05-13 23:28:52 Do we really need to check the @Newsok Editorial pages for it's opinions on fracking, education funding, oil giveaways, healthcare etc ... when later on they're gonna wonder wtf Oklahoma is  at the bottom? 

It's nonsense. 

Oklahoma is at the bottom, because of conservatives.

3550 2018-05-13 23:28:26 The NRA boycott was intended to cost the restaurant business. Instead, those against the NRA kept the restaurant so busy that they gave a significant donation to Moms Demand Action, an NRA opponent.
Pick your own winner and loser. I'll do the same.
3551 2018-05-13 23:28:14 Lowpaying unskilled  jobs, . ,outsmarted by Iran, released 5  terrorists for Traito,r put thousands of job+investment  killing regulations resulting in MINIMAL Growth. Wasted $$$ on green  enterprises. enriching his like minded friends. Snake oil salesman extraordinaire.
3552 2018-05-13 23:28:09 Apply a generous amount   on hair and   scalp,   massage the oil   generously for ten minutes the   wrap your hair in  a    steaming hot   towel for 15 minutes. This will   help lock in the    moisture.  When   done, shampoo and rinse well for   styling.

3554 2018-05-13 23:27:58 Houston found THC in CBD oil and they're tripping out.
3555 2018-05-13 23:27:55 Something about pierogi being formed, then baptized in water, but to be ideal for winning converts, must be anointed/fried by oil?
3556 2018-05-13 23:27:49 it can honestly probably be good up to 400k miles, just keep getting the oil changed when you're supposed to
3557 2018-05-13 23:27:40 Haven’t eaten oil in so long and I made empanadas and now I’m fucking sick 
3558 2018-05-13 23:27:38 Oil collapsed 4q14-4q15; September 2014 oil was still near $100
3559 2018-05-13 23:27:37 Here's some news for you #MAGA.  The average price of gas is predicted to be $3/gallon by Memory day.  You can thank Trump for killing the Iranian deal and putting an oil and gas CEO in charge of foreign policy.
3560 2018-05-13 23:27:33 The  olive oil has several  grades depending on  how and   where it was   derived. by taking this into  concideration, we  usually   take extra   precaution when selecting which  grade to use when   preparing  our hair   products.
3561 2018-05-13 23:27:18 It is  usually  very  important to use  contents that are acceptable to  your body  and   olive  oil being one of  them, the scalp gets to  improve   effectively.
3562 2018-05-13 23:27:18 Cuba example in 1991 showed that deep  economical crisis with no oil and much less food temporaly reversed diabetes trends but it only lasted 5 years
3563 2018-05-13 23:26:57 Hey I started keto like 1 month and a half ago. I've lost 8kg so far. And I got the keto rash 2 weeks ago. I think it's because I'm not eating red meat, mostly chicken. So I'm eating more eggs and red meat to make my PH more acid. For the itch you can put some olive oil on.

3565 2018-05-13 23:26:51 my mom really bought CBD oil for my dogs yo
3566 2018-05-13 23:26:45 I think he went ahead with it and the oil ended up spilling to a river or something?? Obama tried it too but he backed down after protests, but then trump started it up again
3567 2018-05-13 23:26:41 The treatment derived from Olive oil,  is very  effective when it comes  to healing  the issues that affect the  scalp and  hair. This is the main  reason  why it moisturizes the hair due  to its  lightnesss.

3572 2018-05-13 23:25:58 oh but it does....  it aims at disrupting the oil flows from Iran.  This increases oil demand & price.   Who do you think benefits?   Russia...  China...  Saudi...  Etc..
3573 2018-05-13 23:25:50 We need Electric cars so we don't need there oil
3574 2018-05-13 23:25:44 INJIBS HOT OIL TREATMENT is the  essential maintenance product for all hair types.
3575 2018-05-13 23:25:42 To be real I bought my 2011 honda civic 3 years ago with 11,000 miles on it for 11,500 cash and I havent had any issues, I love it, I just get the oil changed when I need to and it runs fine, good on gas, I love it. I wouldn't look into buying american or german anytime soon
3576 2018-05-13 23:25:39 Np. Tough to get deep into details on twitter but QIA is Qatar’s Investment fund. After Trumps election they made a large investment in Rosneft (a Russian oil Co. under US sanctions). Ahmed al rumaihi (head of QIA) allegedly bragged about bribing members of the Trump admin.
3577 2018-05-13 23:25:13 Says the oil shill Albertan.  We are on the ground here and we are the directly affected.
3578 2018-05-13 23:25:09 1. "Students of international politics"? FFS...

Plenty of reasons for problems, I'm sure me, a mere layman can figure it out...

1. Western interference & colonialism.
2. Israel/Palestine
3. Tribal societies
4. Shia/Sunni sectarianism
5. Oil
6. The Cold War...

etc etc..
3579 2018-05-13 23:24:45 Hahahahahah I wish I could.  I can’t drink, I’m allergic to gluten and night shades.   Mine left me long ago.  I actually got kicked out of ketosis by some new CBD oil I’m taking and said to hell with it.  I’m eating some enchiladas!
3580 2018-05-13 23:24:19 These will be grown & used for soybean oil & animal feed
3581 2018-05-13 23:24:18 A lot of us don't care for Iran or Israel.  A lot of us don't want any more American lives spilled in the Middle East.  Besides, if these people lived in an area where Brocolli was the main export instead of oil, nobody would care.
3582 2018-05-13 23:23:49 @THELYZARDWOMAN TWEETED ITS ALL ABOUT A BIG OIL DEAL IN NOV. 10, 2016.
3583 2018-05-13 23:23:34 Why aren’t we drilling for more oil in the United States damn prices are going up we have it drill baby drill
3584 2018-05-13 23:23:32 Just got some more argan oil. My hair loves it. We’ll see.

3587 2018-05-13 23:22:39 It should say, "please give your oil."
3588 2018-05-13 23:22:24 When I was in the 3rd grade, I was a budding artist. One of my oil paintings of flowers won a prize at an art competition. I wrote a report on Mary Cassett's life as someone who greatly influenced me. I find her work and accomplishments amazing to this day.
3589 2018-05-13 23:22:20 It is a fair point and that Tatum kid has star written all over him. The bigger the moment, the better he plays.
3590 2018-05-13 23:22:19 One less country to get oil from. So I'm sure Russia will benefit from that.
3591 2018-05-13 23:22:18 Right from the start, I thought this was going to be about oil $$ - especially when Tillerson joined the party.
3592 2018-05-13 23:22:18 America is in the way now not wanting to see an islamist controlled mid-east because they know they will have to choose oil supply or jews and they heck as won't fight around oil fields you can't count on that as it will impact the world if there is only a few gas stations open
3593 2018-05-13 23:22:16 Don’t let the cartels get ya
3594 2018-05-13 23:22:12 America really think about what's going on here Putin is pulling all the strings with China on this deal in any case America will lose drastically Trump already gave away the oil and Iran to Putin when he pulled out of the deal this was planned
3595 2018-05-13 23:22:09 @DianeSawyer, who will use oil and natural gas in "central Asia," who launders the opium poppy money really, what is being done with the crisis in fertility, on Somalia, on Africa at all, what it means to crush the middle class, and the further developments these cause.
3596 2018-05-13 23:22:04 Place the freezer for a couple of oil in the pan over the centre of water on top, snip over the butter, then sprinkle liberally
3597 2018-05-13 23:22:03 Nobody wants VZ oil...and there is no additional demand...just don't spout silly canned lines..show the data..
3598 2018-05-13 23:22:00 I saw a post on tumblr about the diversity of native tribes back when trump was trying to build the oil pipes over sacred land but I haven’t seen more than a handful of tweets since then
3599 2018-05-13 23:21:58 All 87,000? You now make a contradictory statement claiming boycott did work when before, it backfired and didn't. Which is it?
3600 2018-05-13 23:21:51 GOD knows what is in Netanyahu’s dark soul. Like HiLIARy he thinks he is smarter than others. He fools everybody with his “israel has the right to defend itself but more like israel has the right to kill anybody for oil & land “Even the most arrogant man on earth be fooled by him

3602 2018-05-13 23:21:14 What just changed for the better?  The Europeans buy their oil and invest in their economy and we are sidelined. If they were lying they are still lying. If not let’s hope they do not start rebuilding their enrichment facilities. We lose either way.
3603 2018-05-13 23:21:03 Y’all need to get hip to Argan oil
3604 2018-05-13 23:21:00 This has to stop. And palm oil is bad for u
3605 2018-05-13 23:20:50 Totally for this. Reduces pollution, reliance on fossil fuels, and dependence on foreign oil. It more reliably distributes the electricity distribution load, making it cheaper for homeowners in the long run - 50-60% of energy forever will be paid by their mortgage.
3606 2018-05-13 23:20:50 Being Southern raised there's a part of me that assume's financial success,& speaking to Power are a bit oil,& water in nature? But we all have to be our truest self?
3607 2018-05-13 23:20:44 Owula why, you didn't bring oil..
I bought nkuto +Robb
3608 2018-05-13 23:20:31 Me, experiencing the first summer in my life that didn't turn my skin into an oil slick: I love getting older.

Me, experiencing the first autumn in my life that's turned my skin into a dry patchy mess: I hate getting older.
3609 2018-05-13 23:20:30 Seriously look into kratom. Also CBD oil.
3610 2018-05-13 23:20:22 Too much oil/fat for me. Would be puking after.
3611 2018-05-13 23:20:22 Sis, I have almost all of the Ordinary products. Wash your face before you use the peel. Its gonna sting a bit when you first put it on but it should subside. I have sensitive/acne prone/oil skin and the peel hasn’t irritated my face.
3612 2018-05-13 23:20:18 make your own sugar body scrub - 1/2 cup sugar to 1/4 cup oil (grapeseed, sweet almond, coconut, olive, etc) - toss in a few drops of whatever essential oils you like if you want it to smell like something.

3614 2018-05-13 23:20:17 My #VW has every dash light on and dumps a quart of oil every hour and I've only owned it for 24 hours. Y'all other VW owners better step your game up
3615 2018-05-13 23:19:43 Had BBQ ribs, and brockli cooked in garlic and olive oil for dinner
3616 2018-05-13 23:19:37 Jews are very smart but Iran is fighting it off, trying to take over those gulf oilfields with stooges or allied anti jew movement like muslim brotherhood and threaten america to stay out of a war with israel and dont back it or else no oil. America will choose interest
3617 2018-05-13 23:19:31 -Putin: "Mr Trump, what will you do if elected ?" 
Trump: "I will make America great again, our military the strongest, drill more oil and gas, confront Iran and Syria, no more Soviet empire..."
Putin: "Enough. We will help you get elected. This all I can dream about and more..."

3621 2018-05-13 23:18:47 The Westminster Government and it’s supporting spy agents are wrong to deny Scotland’s independence. Quite simply Scottish Government is so much better than the incompetent Westminster Racist bollocks.
And what did they do with our oil money? Norway has a $Trillion Oil Fund. UK 0
3622 2018-05-13 23:18:40 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
3623 2018-05-13 23:18:28 By bending over...That much oil around, shame to waste it.....
3624 2018-05-13 23:18:25 I’m gonna be online at 7:30-8ish pm pdt. Hoping to do an oil show this evening. 
3625 2018-05-13 23:18:11 No question, fans do cheer for the name on the front of the jersey but if there's no one in said jersey, who exactly is anyone cheering for? Without the players there is nothing worth owning.
3626 2018-05-13 23:17:57 Smokin oil in every restaurant I’m in
3627 2018-05-13 23:17:55 If cheaper oil were still positive for US economy, GDP now and 2014 would’ve been weak and GDP in 2015-16 would’ve been strong, yet the opposite was true.
3628 2018-05-13 23:17:48 I got mine from Young Living Essential Oils off Amazon.
A friend of mine gave me some lavender oil from that company so I looked it up to see if they had eucalyptus oil, so I bought some.

3631 2018-05-13 23:16:52 Doomed.  Leftist economics and Conservative culture mix like oil and water.  It is a house divided before the foundation is even built.  All conservatives want capital to pass on to their children. Socialism can't maintain hegemony of tradition.
3632 2018-05-13 23:16:33 Not if wages are rising w rising oil (& related mfg) as they were doing 2011-14 (and are again.)
3633 2018-05-13 23:16:18 What makes Norway not socialist is that it is a market-based economy  with lots of private property ownership. The reason a lot of assets are owned by the state is bc it has managed its oil wealth well. Good management of oil wealth is not socialism. The definition is garbage.

3636 2018-05-13 23:15:56 @WingsScotland My engine finally seized today. Was it due to lack of oil, gasket failure, chronic knocking, burnt plugs, coolant leaks & general piss poor maintenance? Nope. All Campbell's fault. And he did it all the way from Bath! #blamestuey

3643 2018-05-13 23:14:52 once again US soldiers die to get oil prices up to make world better for 1% of the world.

3645 2018-05-13 23:14:34 Oil prices need to go way up to make money on these investments.
3646 2018-05-13 23:14:26 Nope. The NRA boycotted the restaurant.
3647 2018-05-13 23:14:07 At $150 oil, US produces a lot more oil.  US GDP was demonstrably stronger in 2014 w $110 oil than it is today w $70 oil and definitely stronger than it was w $45 oil.
3648 2018-05-13 23:13:55 I honestly feel like y’all stole that shaving with baby oil gel thing from me
3649 2018-05-13 23:13:47 I went to open studio to paint. Forgot my locker key and only can use the limited oil paints with me. Used the opportunity to do #colortheory #limitedpalette for #oilpainting. #artists #painting #oil #colors
3650 2018-05-13 23:13:36 Forgot to take my 10 drops of CBD oil today so I took them all at once and the whole of my face is drooping
3651 2018-05-13 23:13:14 this looks so painful. i hope you feel better honey. but put pumpkin seed oil on your scalp. it’ll make it grow back fast and super thick. make sure the oil you get is green tho!
3652 2018-05-13 23:13:03 Hope Arteta smuggles some of that oil money out of the emptihad. Stick some in your pockets and fill up a couple of suitcases we're gonna need every penny of that with you as manager lad
3653 2018-05-13 23:12:36 Oil Search Co has bad records world wide. Just get rid of the leaches
3654 2018-05-13 23:12:33 My luck with cars is trash. The amount of things that happen. I should know more than just changing my tires and oil. 
3655 2018-05-13 23:12:29 Sooooo, I got really sunburned at the gig today. Apparently, “The most effective #EssentialOils for sunburn include lavender, sandalwood, frankincense, peppermint, and eucalyptus essential oil.” Good thing I have all of those minus sandalwood!<—that’s a mad sunburned face
3656 2018-05-13 23:12:25 And your cut off for natural is; not using tools to hunt?

What about not digging up their habitats for roads? And then driving cars all over them destroying the ozone layer? Or the oil drilling to put fuel in the cars?

Like the car you’re sitting in?

You want to travel? Walk.
3657 2018-05-13 23:12:14 And who is going to benefit from oil prices going up as a result to the reinstated Iran sanctions?
3658 2018-05-13 23:11:55 He pulled out of the Iran deal so his oil comrades in Russia and Iran can control oil supplies, driving up the price and hitting us in the wallet.
3659 2018-05-13 23:11:53 I feel like it should run on vegetable oil. Ha! Btw as a criminal justice student in DE I just want to thank you for what you do. As I get older, I understand the importance of education and we must implement that to lower recidivism rates for our communities.
3660 2018-05-13 23:11:50 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
3661 2018-05-13 23:11:46 ら〜油おはよぉ！
3662 2018-05-13 23:11:39 第一文型:石油価格は変動する。
Oil prices change.
3663 2018-05-13 23:11:37 Western Canadian Select is way cheaper than Saudi oil.

That's why Irving Oil wanted the Energy East Pipeline and Gulf Coast Refineries love our cheap feedstock.
3664 2018-05-13 23:11:36 INJIBS HAIR FOOD is hand made by mainly Olive Oil, which is derived from  olives and clinically approved for the effectiveness of Hair  Moisturizing.
3665 2018-05-13 23:11:23 lol wht a joke to carry drama further ...since world war2 everyone knows who killed millions around the globe..4the sake of economy and oil
3666 2018-05-13 23:11:05 It's Michael Cohen, Mike Flynn & a Qatari that bribed Flynn. He bought 19.5% share of Russian oil company Rosneft, which confirms another part of the Steeke dossier. Trump's screwed. It's just a matter of time. It will come out Trump/Cohen facilitated the sale & got a commission.
3667 2018-05-13 23:11:04 Isn't it great that Tillerson got his oil money before being kicked out of Bad Boys Club? So relieved!

3672 2018-05-13 23:10:04 Yeah things seems pretty complicated right now, 
a communist oil minister in Iraq, a US coup in the near future 
3673 2018-05-13 23:09:58 I will try 2 help. It shows Michael Cohen with top officials from Qatar’s Sovereign wealth fund (QIA) including ahmed al rumaihi. Al Rumaihi allegedly bragged about bribing members of the Trump Admin. QIA bought a large stake is Rosneft (Russian oil company) after Trump won
3674 2018-05-13 23:09:56 you've got to have olive oil! so good for the skin and your hair too... magic
3675 2018-05-13 23:09:19 It’s oil and you must miss me 
3676 2018-05-13 23:09:08 Stu I hope the weather stays kind so you have plenty of opportunity to get out and ride. You may find squirting the silky oil to your fingertips then applying where needed is less wasteful. I'm looking forward to your review, don’t hesitate in asking if you have any questions.
3677 2018-05-13 23:09:05 Like, perhaps, inventing a more efficient electric system or power source. Instead of crying on twitter about oil on a device powered and created by oil. Make sense?
3678 2018-05-13 23:09:04 Sounds normal. If it’s sugar you’re craving? Apparently stwishing coconut oil around in your mouth for a few minutes then spitting it out takes the cravings away. You don’t need to diet though.

3681 2018-05-13 23:08:41 "Relevant economic unit"? Uh, loophole? Very non-socialist Brandeis liked cooperatives. I'm a fan of muni broadband, electric coops, the post office. You just took a bunch of disagreements and swept them into cheerleading for a market oriented petro-state. Yay Norwegian oil!

3685 2018-05-13 23:07:56 and this was a twist out, I just used water some oil that I have left and you can use gel or  a twisting butter
3686 2018-05-13 23:07:55 Because they bought billions in Russian oil four days later expecting sanctions to be lifted. 
3687 2018-05-13 23:07:46 Where do you get eucalyptus oil from? I want some now.
3688 2018-05-13 23:07:38 Why are UN stepping forward is it they have no oil or minerals to offer,take back her Noble award she is like Hitler.

Today on BBC Simon Reeves presented a documentary about the these people ,so sad to see things like this happening under our nose in 2018 shame on the world n UN
3689 2018-05-13 23:07:28 My own Hair care products on the market and here comes another "Hair grease twisty oil", something like pomade, I've been thinking of my ingredients, something thick but not so much of as oily though
3690 2018-05-13 23:07:02 Keep selling oil as is for now until the RWC has a big pile of cash.Then buy a nuclear powered icebreaker from Russia and set up a port in the Yukon or NWT or Thunder Bay and we've solved our landlocked dilemma.
3691 2018-05-13 23:06:35 おはようございますOILさん
花粉は大丈夫ですか？
3692 2018-05-13 23:06:24 An inconvenient truth made $50 million. The oil industry in the US made $146 billion in 2010 and trillions worldwide. Look who has more vested interest in people continuing to deny climate change.
3693 2018-05-13 23:06:23 Serving ham and eggs to child killers and Nazis,  pocketing profits is ok as long as some goes to a good cause? Ok
3694 2018-05-13 23:06:21 This is serious, so that is why most of them are very naïve to the norms of our society, I simply love pharmacy, we chill, we rock..we love
3695 2018-05-13 23:06:17 Good got whom? The wealthy? Putin is making a mint off oil since trump pulled out of the Iran deal. You people have no idea what’s going on. None.
3696 2018-05-13 23:05:51 Which oil cleansers do you like the most??
3697 2018-05-13 23:05:43 Every time I hear a @GNCLiveWeII advertise, I feel the need to point out that congress chastised  them for selling snake oil to get folks swole.
3698 2018-05-13 23:05:09 Well, it's like Anusol...  They pronounce it... "An-u-saul"...  But you can tell what it is used for ...  "Anus Oil"...
3699 2018-05-13 23:05:03 We're playing Snake Oil in the tabletop room!
3700 2018-05-13 23:04:51 Well, that's it for me! If Nedrick nosebubbles says can't, that's enough for me. I got out my cleaning rod and gun oil.
3701 2018-05-13 23:04:22 Putin: "Mr Trump, what will you do if elected ?" 
Trump: "I will make America great again, our military the strongest, drill more oil and gas, confront Iran and Syria, no more Soviet empire..."
Putin: "Enough. We will help you get elected. This all I can dream about and more..."
3702 2018-05-13 23:04:04 @yellowbird5161 @lilicat06435779 Remember the sale of 19.5% of Russian oil co. Rosneft (Dossier Alleges in exchange for lifting Russian sanctions) Ahmed Al-Rumaihi works for the QAI investment fund that got part of Rosneft.  Ahmed Al-Rumaihi met w/ Cohen and Flynn at Trump Tower.
3703 2018-05-13 23:04:03 Wonder if trump owns any oil stocks?
3704 2018-05-13 23:03:58 You see, you start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it
3705 2018-05-13 23:03:48 Looks like an oil refinery on fire

3709 2018-05-13 23:03:36 Can you post the link?
3710 2018-05-13 23:03:33 The coal BC mines and ships, plus USA coal falls in the same standards. I agree it has to be phased out but why not let big oil pay for it. Shutting all resources down holds growth back. This allows the government to take more control. We all grow from others resources.
3711 2018-05-13 23:03:31 la tea tree oil ça pique les yeux l'odeur quand même
3712 2018-05-13 23:03:15 And I suppose women can do simple things like change the oil in their car, or change a flat, or replace the chain on a chain saw, or split wood, or ... Do you see where I'm going here? You'd think women were children.
3713 2018-05-13 23:03:04 Mueller needs to hurry up. You've already enriched the Russian economy and made Putin billions richer by ending the Iran deal and increasing oil prices.

3715 2018-05-13 23:02:30 And gas is going up thanks to the uncertainty from Trump walking away from Iran deal. Russia is thrilled though, their economy depends on high oil prices. Donald delivers again!(just not to Americans)

3721 2018-05-13 23:01:49 Oils a bad argument for this just cause US doesn’t get a lot of oil from the Middle East and it’s more China,India,Japan who would have issues with Iraq nationalizing oil.

3726 2018-05-13 23:01:11 I wouldn’t be surprised if getting out of the Iran deal was to get rich off of the inevitable spike in oil barrel prices, thus increasing stock prices. All about the !
3727 2018-05-13 23:00:56 About the whole climate change is fake and just the work of big science, do these people believe big oil doesn't exist or is it just much less powerful a lobby. Ffs if you think someone is out to get you why don't you apply that skepticism globally?
3728 2018-05-13 23:00:46 Err, we're not high on the list of farming nations. There's a reason for that. You mention we are a net importer of food. if the rest of the world disappeared, we'd have a very hungry population pretty quick. Not just talking about olive oil or bananas

3769 2018-05-13 22:51:13 So is Trump trying to get markets ready for their HUGE Rosneft oil intro using Pruitt to undo environmental regulations & stop support of alternative energy projects including fuel emission standards.

3785 2018-05-13 22:48:46 Actually Venezuela is still dealing with the fallout of a massive oil price crash in the 80s (oil accounts for around 80% of their total production) and the fallout of the Bolivarian revolution which is why their currency is still in such a rapid state of devaluation
3786 2018-05-13 22:48:26 Get ready to Short oil in other words.

3789 2018-05-13 22:48:06 Oil was never my cup of tea, but good luck. A lot of geopolitical tensions will surely drive the price up.

3791 2018-05-13 22:47:53 No I think he and Israel want to disrupt peace and steal oil. France and Germany tried to get Trump to not fall for it but they  can now know how Corrupt Trump is and Israel's PM is under investigation by his government has been for a while.
3792 2018-05-13 22:47:52 @realDonaldTrump Hey tough guy why aren't you doing something about oil prices? Release some of the strategic reserve or are you in bed with the Saudis and Russians? You want to help average Americans? Fix this now. Let's see if you have the balls to do anything!
3793 2018-05-13 22:47:30 I love Plugra, used to get it all the time, but lately I've been just getting the @AldiUS butter, it's fine, and $2.99 (occasionally a bit less). Aldi has very little overhead, thus great prices. If you have Aldi in NYC… I also get great EV Olive Oil at Aldi, 1/3 the $ of others

3800 2018-05-13 22:46:41 Valuable lessons from my momma:
 
1. Always put baby powder on oil stains.
2. 7Up is a cure for all stomach aches. 
3. Take tissues with you wherever you go. 
4. Clorox is the elixir for cleaning everything.

3806 2018-05-13 22:45:31 and both have a problem - oil
3807 2018-05-13 22:45:10 Wrong! Under your mentality Canadian politicians are also to blame for the WORLDWIDE spike in gas prices?
Blame who's to blame - greedy oil companies !!!
3808 2018-05-13 22:45:06 weird how in walle robots take care of compressing garbage instead of us leaving like..... plastic eating microbes and oil sucking mushrooms. guess you can’t make a movie about that tho.
3809 2018-05-13 22:44:41 Trade needs to be 2 way. Right now china exports 650-700b/ year to America, while America sends 150b to China. Of that 150b, more than 2/3 of it is either garbage, low-end resources such as copper/oil/etc, or food from businesses owned by Chinese gov.
3810 2018-05-13 22:44:35 Perfume RT @GhettoBasquiat: 2.) Do you prefer cologne/perfume, oil, or do you rely on lotions?
3811 2018-05-13 22:44:22 Shockingly I got like 100 likes on tweet about oil and Trump. Nice to know others felt the same way. 
3812 2018-05-13 22:44:16 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles.
3813 2018-05-13 22:44:11 Limiting the supply of oil from Iran is the best way for those investing in Oil to make some real money.   Congratulations.   Maybe this time Europe won't stand by us, and underwrite the insurance on the Iranisn oil tankers .

3818 2018-05-13 22:43:45 So the country is importing money ....instead of re-tooling selected industries,subsidising key products such as beef,sugar,cocking oil,rice,fruits..am disappointed because economic fundamentals are hardly being addressed!!! Have we learnt anything from the past?

3820 2018-05-13 22:43:20 Turnout was light & problems at the polls were many, but Iraqi's VOTED for the 1st time since the country declared victory over ISIS - Voter apathy reflected continued economic struggles, stemming in part from a drop in global oil prices - There's also much political corruption

3824 2018-05-13 22:42:39 We are in default of the Iran deal. We signed it and the prove you used to go into default was bogus. It benefits your good friends in Saudi Arabia and Russian not to mention gives Israel free reign to promote war. This is all about oil,greed and control.

‘You just had to get away from the press today. Uh huh i know you popular! Have a great day beautiful!’ 

3834 2018-05-13 22:41:37 Overheard at the grocery store: “No - I don’t want that Dairyland crap. I want Cool Whip - the good stuff”. You know you’re in Alberta when you prefer edible oil product over the real thing.
3835 2018-05-13 22:41:22 I know that studies say that if we did everything to reduce emissions like the accords wanted it won’t do much, I know clean energy isn’t advanced enough or really that clean. I’m also pretty sure YOU use a car n your house runs on electricity powered by oil lol
3836 2018-05-13 22:41:19 Backing out of the Iran deal was part of this deal to drive up oil prices.
3837 2018-05-13 22:41:16 Yup,  RU wins bigly on oil and gas sales.
3838 2018-05-13 22:41:13 From what I know, palm oil is the latest product on the market, whether it is responsibly sourced or not. Do we need it, given the variety of oils available! Maybe just leave the forests alone.

3840 2018-05-13 22:40:55 The addition of tiny amounts of avocado and/or olive oil or other "healthy" ingredients enables manufacturers to fraudulently "health wash" industrial refined crap in a bottle with misleading labels and marketing. 
3841 2018-05-13 22:40:44 does tanning oil count?

3843 2018-05-13 22:40:43 There is a gross brainwashing in process that attempts to give currency to the myth that Jews have no rights to the land of Judea (now called Israel) after which Jews are named. Good on POTUS & USA for not bowing down to pressure over Arab oil. #realreason

3847 2018-05-13 22:40:13 It depends on the skin, the oil and how much being used. Personally, I use jojoba and it does me fine, but if I pile tht shit on I break out.

3859 2018-05-13 22:37:23 Golan Heights was annexed by Israel after decades of skirmishes & wars with Syria. Israel's right to this territory is rejected by International Law & should be returned to Syria - but Rothschilds won't let this happen b/c of vast amounts of #Oil!

Now about the war TRUMP wants with Iran..something to do with a deal TRUMP has with Rosneft! Oil prices go up and a lot of money made by Trump
3867 2018-05-13 22:35:58 And by violating the Iran deal they cause more instability in the Middle East, the price of oil and oil company shares go up - muchofor all.
3868 2018-05-13 22:35:55 Ask Greece and Venezuela why they are in the situation they are now.

Ask why we went into recession when oil price crashed.

Ask why some countries Reserve is in $Tr

3871 2018-05-13 22:35:34 The Rosneft transaction also purportedly sent a $500 million dollar brokerage fee to Carter Page, or perhaps the Trump Campaign. Also surrogate Rudy Giuliani listed the Russian oil giant as one of his law clients at Bracewell & Giuliani, LLP in 2014 according to Bloomberg.
3872 2018-05-13 22:35:27 Man, if us american citizens have to go along with toppling these oil rich countries so the trillionairs can control their resources and install the central debt slave banks, we should as citizens get to live like a millionaire for 1 day per person.  What do you say sir?

3894 2018-05-13 22:31:27 that. and also he stands to make $ when oil—>  via his Caymans-insulated Rosneft investment vehicle, and political influence via co-investors QIA who are also pursuing alt-right news outlet Newsmax. but yeah.
3895 2018-05-13 22:31:16 The US "behaved badly" when it blatantly overthew the Iranian government under Mossadegh in 1953 to steal their oil, installed Shah Pahlavi, basically another dictator, until he turn overthrown by the religious fanatics under Ayatollah Khomeini that led to the US Embassy siege.

3897 2018-05-13 22:31:02 Simple. If Trump wants his NK deal China wants something to let it happen. This is one thing. So far Trump has turned his back and the USA on everyone except Israel, Russia and China. He will work out a deal on Iran war with Russia. They both want the oil so prices go up.

1) Qatar doesn’t need oil
2) No sane country would invest in a Russian Oil Co after they ripped off @BP
3) They bought the stake BEFORE the meet... like they knew they needed it for the meet.

We could've been at the forefront, created a competitive advantage for our people. But Trump turned us backward.

3917 2018-05-13 22:28:39 I haven’t changed hair products recently, so I don’t think so. I’m worried it’s my makeup removing oil.

3919 2018-05-13 22:28:22 Oh Wind River, that movie that contains a very traumatizing rape scene set in a place where crime is both unreported and unnoticed because oil companies don’t care that their own workers are scumbag criminals? And you still wonder why the #NoDAPL protest was so relevant to Ntvs.
3920 2018-05-13 22:28:14 Yes! Invade country for one man soon! This will in no way drive oil up and benefit Russia and we'll be in and out with victory in 24, 72 hours tops.  You could order pizza in time it takes to win! #MAGA #MIGA
3921 2018-05-13 22:27:56 So a possible peace treaty with North Korea, who was never a threat to the United States, and a likely war with Iran who was also never a threat but has oil. Not much of an accomplishment. It's not the media that's the problem. It's Trump and his enablers like Fox.
3922 2018-05-13 22:27:52 If Trump makes millions or billions on Russian oil he could care less about American people.
3923 2018-05-13 22:27:48 My husband grew up in government housing, trailers with the floor gone rats climbing up inside in the winter. I came along and pushed him to do what he wanted. Now he thinks he’s poor because he’s back to low 6 figures after the oil field tanked.
3924 2018-05-13 22:27:42 A yorkshire pudding commonly uses the beef fat from the sunday roast to oil the pans it’s in and is most commonly served with said roast!! They can stay mad
3925 2018-05-13 22:27:31 Orthodox make zero sense. Jesus asked us to have faith, love Him & try to honour his word. Not to harm us, but to give us the most pain-free, fulfilling life on earth. Gold decor, dunking babies, oil, incense & ritual rules are man made nonsense. Just have faith & believe. Simple

3932 2018-05-13 22:26:37 Democrats are a propaganda arm of the Iranian govt.

Iran Deal: Obvious

Iraq War: America was stealing oil, causing terror and torturing people,

Oil policy: Close down US Oil production & buy Mid East Oil.

Arab Spring: Remove secular Arab leaders.

3933 2018-05-13 22:26:36 From, what i understand the demand cost is the cost of drilling, and shipment to harbor,and. The supply cost is the supply cost is from country to country travel of a barrel of oil on ships. Which is all placed on the american pumps.
3934 2018-05-13 22:26:35 It's about Gas and Oil..
who's going to have the supply needed ?
3935 2018-05-13 22:26:35 Trump is doing this for money and oil. Trump and his friends will make lots of money when oil prices start to rise. Prob has deals in place with Saudi Arabia.
3936 2018-05-13 22:26:28 sometimes, you tolerate a squealing microwave turntable for months. but then other times, you use the food grade mineral oil that came with your cutting board to grease down the turntable casters and actually fix it.
3937 2018-05-13 22:26:24 Nothing like a good grease up and oil change!!
3938 2018-05-13 22:26:14 YAHOO BOYS ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES TAINTING OUR IMAGE ABROAD. 

HALLIBURTON BRIBED OUR POLITICIANS FOR OIL CONTRACTS AND DESPITE AMERICAN COURTS JAILING SOME OF THEIR OFFICIALS, NOT ONE OF OUR POLITICIANS HAS BEEN CHARGED TALK MORE OF SEEING THE INSIDE OF A JAIL CELL.
3939 2018-05-13 22:26:05 Two big labor cases to keep an eye out for when #SCOTUS issues opinions tomorrow: Murphy Oil (do class action waivers violate workers’ rights?) and Janus (can public sector unions force workers to pay “fair share” fees?).
3940 2018-05-13 22:25:41 @DrGundry love your program. Take a shot of extra virgin olive oil each morning. Can I also have Apple cider vinegar and will be okay to take?
3941 2018-05-13 22:25:35 My temporary tax cut is going to big oil and pharmaceutical companies by way of skyrocketing prices. Thanks Trump!
3942 2018-05-13 22:25:16 @elonmusk can tell you all about the #1 corporate parasite that has been feasting of government subsidies at taxpayers expense - the Oil Industry. All this brought to you by neoliberalism and taxpayer money.

Your welcome!!!
3943 2018-05-13 22:24:30 おはよぉ
3944 2018-05-13 22:24:22 You are right .  My husbands partner was black and as they were riding the boat to the oil rig, he said he was glad his great whatever granddad got caught.
Elementary kids digging ditches after school. The pictures and what he went through changed my “well they don’t know beter
3945 2018-05-13 22:23:58 None of them, that’s the point. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting oil futures one summer and Eduardo won’t come close to getting in. The ability to make money doesn’t impress anybody around here.

3949 2018-05-13 22:23:18 And like...completion of horizontal well number 2 in north Texas is a potential near term catalyst alongside higher oil prices. Could theoretically double (or more than double) Q1 output?!?!?!?
3950 2018-05-13 22:22:56 Did Zahawi trade in oil from Isis controlled oil fields in Iraq?
ok islamic state mightve been supported by CIA and Israel but arent they the bad guys?

3952 2018-05-13 22:22:34 Now maybe the oil reserve will be used. Big deal.  We make oil. We don’t make deals with terrorists.
3953 2018-05-13 22:22:27 Oil is going through the roof #commodities
3954 2018-05-13 22:22:16 want to make infused oil
3955 2018-05-13 22:21:56 Left Georgetown this morning and PetroCanada price was $1.38.9. Got gas in London Ontario for $1.21.9, 17 cents per litre  cheaper. What the heck! Same oil, same company, same taxes - So why the incredible price difference. Something is wrong here in the GTA folks.
3956 2018-05-13 22:21:47 America lost prestige when Obama did not enforce the "red line". Trump on the other hand bombed Syria for using CMs and he annihilated a Russian battalion trying to take oil fields in Syria. Obama's "strategic patience" in Korea was a weak policy unlike Trump's. Europe needs us.
3957 2018-05-13 22:21:39 America has been F***ed over far too long by the Oil Companies and idiots of the NRA..
3958 2018-05-13 22:21:23 The oil in Generac pressure washer should be changed after every 20 hours of usage. RT to spread this #MaintenanceTip

3961 2018-05-13 22:20:49 i wonder what @MIB_JADE would do w. wasabi oil...
 
happy mother’s day!
3962 2018-05-13 22:20:25 A concrete plan? We had a plan, and our allies are going to stick with it. Now all that Trump did was cut us out of the deals with the oil! Now are gas prices are going to go through the roof!
3963 2018-05-13 22:19:29 I use liquid santan. normally they tell you to use coconut oil mixed with something else, I think avocado might be good for you
3964 2018-05-13 22:18:59 オイルがあるから、みんな生きているんだYO
3965 2018-05-13 22:17:57 Haha. Almost quoted you, so transparency that you ...
  Should’ve said “Econ independence” not oil
3966 2018-05-13 22:17:37 Obsessed with palma violets, I've always got some of the sweets in my house & I've now got the fragrance oil aswell
3967 2018-05-13 22:17:29 Maybe some multi-national oil investment because oil sands is expensive to mine and ship and not really needed - a trend that started long before the current government was elected. Too bad CPC and Alberta Cons focused on a commodity subject to world pricing and demand. Dork.
3968 2018-05-13 22:17:27 Take care
3969 2018-05-13 22:17:25 Too much oil for me.
3970 2018-05-13 22:17:21 This coconut oil just gave the glow of an Egyptian god
3971 2018-05-13 22:17:13 @RadoxUK so, according to the ingredients list, the liquid soap has palm oil in it. I haven’t dared look at my shower gel and bubble bath. Please please tell me you’re going address this.
3972 2018-05-13 22:17:12 Saturated fats are also found in a few vegetable oils, such as palm oil, coconut oil, hydrogenated oils, and chocolate. #HeartHealth

3978 2018-05-13 22:16:10 Wish I wasn’t in this “nothing sounds fun/something will go wrong” mood about going out because it’s a nice Sunday and all I’ve done if get my oil changed and eat by myself.
3979 2018-05-13 22:16:04 I use olive oil.

me, today: one pot of coconut oil for 3 weeks
3982 2018-05-13 22:15:40 Such a static is matter of governance. Rand calls it Gross Regional Product. KRG claimed oil independence for a few years. This should be matrer of access to data and math!
3983 2018-05-13 22:15:38 The Media no longer makes enough money from advertisers to pay the "talent", support workers and costs of operation. Big Oil and the Banks won the auctions for bandwidth and frequencies and then consolidated the networks. Now, it's all about making centralization desirable
3984 2018-05-13 22:15:35 They will greet us as liberators. Their oil production will pay the full costs of our military intervention... 

Wait. Wrong war. Sorry.
3985 2018-05-13 22:15:34 Putin is getting everything he has dreamed of.  POTUS is doing everything possible to breakup our Western allies.  Remember when he said that we should have taken Iraqi oil?  Can't tell if he is just trying to bully or if he wants to create a worldwide Empire under the USA.

3996 2018-05-13 22:13:47 Every person in this country that does any business with a bank, credit union or other financial institution, has their money tied to the KMP investment. Every single mutual fund based investment is going to has oil stock! Time to build the pipeline and build profits!
3997 2018-05-13 22:13:46 Is that the actual bitcoin booth or a stop to confuse noobs with the Roger Ver snake oil pitch for bcash?
3998 2018-05-13 22:13:35 This was done by Rand Coporation. It is good but incomplete since it doesn’t include oil. Non-oil GRP
3999 2018-05-13 22:13:27 The threat of President Donald Trump exiting the Iran nuclear agreement might be a nightmare for international diplomacy, but investors in oil stocks have thoroughly enjoyed the volatile ride.

4003 2018-05-13 22:13:08 You think chefs wear shirts to cook for your health? Wrong. They wear them for their own safety because oil burns on the stomach hurt. It's a sensitive area... My stomach hurts now

Tell this to Rohit Vemula’s parents. Tell this to Manjunath’s family who lost their IIM educated son to the oil mafia. 
Tell them hard work & self-improvement could have saved their lives.
4010 2018-05-13 22:12:28 Surely a million dollar payment to Cohen, carefully funnelled through a Russian oligarch wasn't the payoff for a deal with a dodgy Qatari over Russian oil fields!? #basta #SwampCreatures
4011 2018-05-13 22:12:25 Our money is used to ‘oil the machine’.
4012 2018-05-13 22:11:53 The smart jews are on the left in the world, not just responding to threats but resolving it right at the root level so other countries can't use it as an excuse to attack you. Where-as the right just want you to rely on america who will switch if oil fields fall into MB
4013 2018-05-13 22:11:52 I just bought a cool new CD/cassette tape player!  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
4014 2018-05-13 22:11:25 “In 21st century the Nobel Committee has embraced efforts to limit the harm done by man-made climate change and threats to the environment as relevant to the Peace Prize”.  Consider our parks, other pristine environments when making corporate greed decisions with oil, mining, etc
4015 2018-05-13 22:11:19 So $EGL has a market cap of $20.7 million. Q1 revenue was $12.5 million. So, discounting ANY growth of production OR additional revenue from higher oil prices, it's currently trading at just over 1.6x Q1 revenue. Am I missing something? That seems insane. @JMaserati @CDNtrader93
4016 2018-05-13 22:11:04 Evidence strongly indicates that Trump and his campaign associates brokered a massive oil privatization deal, where his Organization facilitated a global financial transaction to sell Russian Oil stock to its Syrian War adversary, the Emirate of Qatar.

4024 2018-05-13 22:09:36 Enough oil money to save up for hard times . Besides, the government took the control of farms and factories because the rich people are eviiiiil and killed all the production in the country. Yay!
4025 2018-05-13 22:09:35 You can put in simlpe terms Canadian economy GDP is 1.7T;  comparable with Texas which has 50% less people. If you take away oil & gas sector Canadian GDP would be 900B, if you on top of that take contibitions of all remaining resouce sector Canadian GDP would shrink to 500B.

4028 2018-05-13 22:08:56 No. KM has had no losses due to accidental leakage. You only want the Saudis and Iraqui’s to. Make millions $$$ on oil production? KM has set aside a $50 m emergency response fund. The Frds are staffing multiple coast guard stations. You are an alarmist sheep.

4031 2018-05-13 22:08:38 If you are like my Obama hating cousin who refused to buy insurance thru the marketplace, what can I tell you? You missed out on a subsidy. You know, like the oil companies get. Love you too. Happy mothers day to you too, if you identify as one yourself.

4043 2018-05-13 22:06:08 None of the protests against the pipeline have anything to do with spills,it’s about shutting down the oil sands.
4044 2018-05-13 22:06:01 My favourite smell is a weird one. It's the smell of my dads factory. It smells like a mix of paint and oil and grease and reminds me of weekends as a kid going to work with him x

Of course he does and he may well be telling the truth, however, as prime minister he cannot bring about the society he wants without the oil revenue here in the top of the UK.

Labour tory, same old story
4047 2018-05-13 22:05:32 Since 1960, only 0.2% has been certified as reclaimed, and approximately 10% has been replanted. This statistic is from Suncors own website as describing all of Alberta’s oil sands development. Sounds like a few hundred million more trees are going to be required... Get to work!
4048 2018-05-13 22:05:30 Maybe the end game is just to create enough panic on oil traders to have oil barrel price skyrocket. Then they all get rich, Iran's hardliners take control, Putin becomes hero convinces 45 to do 180, maybe a few thousand soldiers dead. Callousness anyone? #FBR #TheResistance
4049 2018-05-13 22:05:11 That means, and your tweet today confirms, some BIG MONEY just stepped in the batter's box.  Not fake/Trump money, tho he is cashing in on selling access to the POTUS, but oil money. USA doesn't survive another 50 years.  Too dumb, too fat and too uninterested. #Whatashame

4053 2018-05-13 22:04:55 あら、美人さんやね…
4054 2018-05-13 22:04:53 Ask WHY gas prices are getting crazy high!!

The asshats in DC have eliminated all the EPA regs that were supposed to be strangling oil companies. 

When is enough, enough?
4055 2018-05-13 22:04:47 damn what did I do  Honestly these oil spatters are punishment enough lmao
4056 2018-05-13 22:04:37 It’s seems like the oil industry is deliberately trying to pollute the water. They are probably major investors in water sales  and will corner that market once oil runs out.
4057 2018-05-13 22:04:29 im getting really annoyed with this stupid tincture bottles like how do they literally not stay closed at all. im tired of oil spilling everywhere and i dont feel like spending 10$ on a new bottle that may just as bad.
4058 2018-05-13 22:04:23 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ! null
4059 2018-05-13 22:04:17 Hotelling's Rule is why Oil has rallied so hard btw. And stretched dollar liquidity. But that's part of Fed unwinding & interest rates.
4060 2018-05-13 22:04:07 Drink the nearest anointing oil bro
4061 2018-05-13 22:03:59 Wow.  Thanks Ale.
My conclusion:  Putin's strategy (in part) is monopolize energy.  Thus, Perry is a key ally of Putin's in orchestrating the goal with Ambassador Burt (consultant to Gazprom, works for Kissinger).  Putin needs the price of oil to go up.
4062 2018-05-13 22:03:49 How does Trump walking away from the Iran nuclear deal negatively influence Russia's position in Syria now? Putin needs the $ for oil to go up to improve RUS economy. This will do just that.
4063 2018-05-13 22:03:41 I totally agree through charities and arab oil rich funding they have infiltrated anti hate groups, law,academia,politics,police and media this shackles action until they are powerful enough in numbers and political power to rule.
4064 2018-05-13 22:03:36 Gulf leaders last thing they want is the brotherhood and iran controlling mid-east as it will remove them from power as they have a key commodity they want to use to negiotate with America to stop them backing israel or suffer global oil shortage. Interest vs Backin Israel
4065 2018-05-13 22:03:23 if you do go full keto, supplement with mct oil in the initial stages to help negate the effects of keto flu as you transition from a carbohydrate based to fat based diet. Be keenly aware of your macros. You are going to have a tendency to  lean more to protein than fat and you
4066 2018-05-13 22:02:59 The only thing I missed about being home was having a legitimate meal that’s not either deep fried or saturated in oil.
4067 2018-05-13 22:02:48 @CodyRhodes @MattJackson13 @NickJacksonYB Congrats on The 10k #OneHourSellout  How about u come to Indianapolis & SELL OUT Lucas Oil Stadium #OnToTheNextOne ....??? PLEASE Consider it
4068 2018-05-13 22:02:42 Congrats Ken
4069 2018-05-13 22:02:35 As long as Russia gets a navel port in Syria that’s his long term goal. Iran is just another criminal state that he sells his weapons too. And a competitor in the sales of oil and gas and would like nothing better then their products shut down.

4074 2018-05-13 22:02:03 What friends? There’s only diplomacy and deal making. Wasn’t it in 1979/80 Jacque chirac of France traded nuclear reactor parts and engineers to Sadam Hussein of Iraq for oil and cash? Look at the Muslim ridden country France has become.With friends like these who needs enemies.
4075 2018-05-13 22:01:35 Beds Are Burning - Midnight Oil
4076 2018-05-13 22:01:34 And you wonder why Trump ended the IRAN deal - Russian Female host says: "Looks like we found it. Trump is withdrawing US from the Iran nuclear deal. Oil prices should go up, which is good for us."  TRUMP IS A TRAITOR !!!
4077 2018-05-13 22:01:30 Damn you guys why did I think that frying nuggets with water instead of oil would be a good idea at this time of the night
4078 2018-05-13 22:01:07 I said since the beginning the presidency was an oil deal btwn exxon, tillerson, Putin and Trump. Exactly so. #TrumpIsSoDirty
4079 2018-05-13 22:00:38 Would not oil haha

4085 2018-05-13 22:00:08 Anticipate oil at 100-150a barrel according to CNBC. But what do they know huh joe
4086 2018-05-13 22:00:02 Burning the MIDNIGHT OIL should never be for nothing but something totally worth!!! Don't do it if you won't do it...!!

4092 2018-05-13 21:58:17 Haha! I feel you! The big chop is a no no. If you keep braiding your hair and leaving it out for a few days in between, time will go by fast! 

My key has been to condition, moisturize and oil frequently, then protein treatments every now and then.

4096 2018-05-13 21:57:03 What's different vs oil frying?
4097 2018-05-13 21:56:55 Any oil will do. You just put it in the hole and leave it for a bit. Softens any hard bits for washing out - works on grubby kids for sure!
4098 2018-05-13 21:56:50 Love it!! I spray lavender and frankincense essential oil every night before bed on my pillows!

4103 2018-05-13 21:55:58 Thank you ! The apples were my snack :)  the balm is made with organic beeswax, coconut oil and cocoa butter plus a special mix of essential oils for prosperity
4104 2018-05-13 21:55:56 It isn't only the withdrawal from the deal with Iran that is an issue.  The more Russia's influence expands in the middle eat, it suits them to have instability increase in the region.  Oil supply to the west is threatened, prices go up, Russia's economy booms
4105 2018-05-13 21:55:51 It seems he has a lot of international oil and gas experience too.  I think you’re right about this guy after checking the photos.
4106 2018-05-13 21:55:47 And btw, the resolutions were on the UN website.  Saddam violated ALL of them.  And further research helped me find out that Koffi Annan's son was doing business with Saddam for oil.  That information is still available on the net.
4107 2018-05-13 21:55:47 Ha that would definitely be more than enough baby oil

4120 2018-05-13 21:54:51 And then can we please do military bases?  The sound  of eyes rolling with MSNBC on is deafening. 
4121 2018-05-13 21:54:30 Wanted them sanctions lifted so them Russian oligarchs could make their trillion dollar oil deal. Destabilize Iran. Cause destabilization in Iran’s oil market and the oligarchs can make trillions more.  Follow the fkn money.
4122 2018-05-13 21:54:23 It all ties in to this ending the Iran deal as well. Murdoch is part of a company called Genie Oil who are drilling in Syria as we speak. This all goes very deep and is very dark.
4123 2018-05-13 21:54:22 This is new information. Is Tequila an acceptable substitute, if I'm out of olive oil?

• North Korea threatens to nuke Israel.
• North Korea is proven to have enormous untapped oil reserves.
• North Korea becomes a Muslim nation.

4139 2018-05-13 21:52:16 That the price of crude oil going back above $100/barrel will have more impact (if sustained) than any current policy to reduce use of gas and diesel vehicles.

4147 2018-05-13 21:50:53 I was listening once to Don Coxe conference call with clients.

He said: Look out for the term "crude oil equivalents" in order not to be misled. They use the term to mix up crude oil with natgas.

It stayed with me. I never forgot it.
4148 2018-05-13 21:50:49 I aslo like how he keeps insisting that it's his personal position, not Rosneft's. It's like, dude, if you want to keep calling allied countries names, maybe you just quit the state oil company which pays to comment on its behalf.
4149 2018-05-13 21:50:29 Iran’s military budget could only have gone up with the infusion of the Obozo cash.  Oil prices were down, so they took the cash Obozo let them have and built their military.
4150 2018-05-13 21:50:17 You mean “America First,” like “Drain the Swamp”?  He’s a snake oil salesman. He NEVER meant any of it. The Russians gave him lines they had tried out, that worked, on gullible Americans & he used them to get elected. It’s a simple bait & switch game. Don, The Con, did it again.

4161 2018-05-13 21:49:00 Yeah, they are just going to hand over the Golan Heights to Genie Oil; Trump is going to take from Russia its only warm water port, and put the US embassy in Jerusalem without any objection; and instead of Iran getting nukes 10 years from now it aquires nukes in 1yr. Great plan!
4162 2018-05-13 21:48:51 "and help them to change the regime in Iran."

Well, the US has done it before, but then it was to get their own man in place at the top, obtaining a better grip on Iranian oil.
(Operation Ajax 1953)

I don't think the US (or UK) has ever apologised for that.

4168 2018-05-13 21:48:01 Unless you are too stupid to notice, it's exactly what they are doing now and will continue to do.  Your dumbass thinks starting this war will get you their oil? 
Ask W and Cheney, they found out our enemies and allies, will not allow it.
Just shut up.
4169 2018-05-13 21:47:54 Been over $3 in California since just after the elections, when the Russians and the Saudis started restricting the oil supply.

4171 2018-05-13 21:47:51 This is all about Israel expanded into Lebanon for water and Golan for oil ,  Syria and hezbollah are blocking those plans so we must destroy them

4174 2018-05-13 21:47:33 Iran's currency weakened due to State Sponsors of Terrorism sanction. Further regime devastated by inflation and unemployment. JCPOA by Obama and P5+1 lightened sanction to help Iran sell oil for goods. Why Europe being out of place pushed its way sell irrelevant expensive cars?

4188 2018-05-13 21:45:52 Well, that’s just a f(x) of price...take oil to that $300 number and I assure you we’d be oil independent on net  ;)
4189 2018-05-13 21:45:46 Next war... Iran!! Don't they have a lot of oil? Is Trump in the oil business?
4190 2018-05-13 21:45:45 Luke 19:11-27 when I look at how Nigeria was formed by the Britain, then I remember this quotation as it was written in the bible. They killed my people to give the meaningless & useless name to us. Let Nigeria break like USSR because it is overdue for total breakup. OILGAS
4191 2018-05-13 21:45:33 I think oil, gold, and yeilds could retrace now. Everybody thought inflation so it's probably deflation. $UUP looking like the real strength.
4192 2018-05-13 21:45:22 Most importantly, don‘t use water to fight oil that caught fire cuz that literally only makes this worse
4193 2018-05-13 21:44:58 •shaving tip!
if you’re going to shave before prom, I strongly recommend doing so with coconut oil instead of shaving cream. after doing it, your legs will feel oily but if you do it before going to bed, you’ll wake up with baby-soft legs! (ig: selfandskin)
4194 2018-05-13 21:44:46 To today's talking head who said #Saudis will offset #oil price spike due to new US #Iran policy: "Saudi officials reportedly targeting an oil price as high as $100/barrel to support valuation of #Aramco before its initial public offering" (5/14 Barron's,p21; Oil price now $78).
4195 2018-05-13 21:44:32 Unless its all orchestrated. Russia gets a tear in US Europe relations, oil price increase amongst other blows to their European enemies. Cmon Mooch stop lying u know what the deal is.

4197 2018-05-13 21:43:28 I actually love your name! I LIVED for the “Oil Spill” video you did, that was such an awesome way to connect your name + amp up the . I agree with others, the new name is clever but OWL just is so unique & memorable! Maybe find a way to shorten it instead of changing? GL! 
4198 2018-05-13 21:43:28 う～ん微妙に寒い
4199 2018-05-13 21:43:24 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.
4200 2018-05-13 21:43:22 There better be photos!!!! 
4201 2018-05-13 21:43:15 Keep spending that oil money
4202 2018-05-13 21:43:13 Been listening to a whole bunch of oil bulls all weekend. Gets me stoked to be in oil/gas. April run up was great. Consolidation over the last couple weeks has been good too, and important. Not that I won't take another big run up this week. :)

4203 2018-05-13 21:43:06 FWIW: a clairaudient Danish ISFJ oil heiress, throwing aside an aquamarine bandolier, is quickly trotting along without a care in the world on a sleepy Shetland pony.
4204 2018-05-13 21:43:03 Also I'd question how much does the West really need to increase its oil  exposure this late in the fossil fuel era? The shadows are lengthening  on fossil fuels with every electric car & bus, every solar panel. Same  is true for China even more so, as leading solar nation.

4210 2018-05-13 21:41:19 @AllenMillyard hi allen. Would you know any suppliers in the uk to get an oil pressure relief switch for a Kawasaki z400? Any info gratefully received.  Thanks
4211 2018-05-13 21:41:02 Noooo. Numerous reasons here's two .. applying for visas for EU holidays, paying for medical care as no EU card after. .. no more EU  funding for our cities.. science, research exchange, Norway has oil we don't, we need EU plus it's culture diversity not blinkered walls
4212 2018-05-13 21:40:56 It’s the season for constant messy hair and smelling like tanning oil. I love lake life.
4213 2018-05-13 21:40:52 In 2008 a barrel of oil cost $150.00 USD and gas was $1.35 per litre. 
Now, in 2018, a barrel of oil costs $70.00 USD and a litre of gas is $1.35 cad. Wrap your head around the fist fucking Canadians are getting. #canada #oil #highgas #gasprice #bs
4214 2018-05-13 21:40:46 Either Magnesium or CBD oil!
4215 2018-05-13 21:40:35 Don't forget about the oil drilling at ANWR.
4216 2018-05-13 21:40:31 Really, how much is a barrel of oil today. Russia is a gas station with a nuclear arsenal. When oil was below $50 a barrel they were in real trouble. Now the cash is flowing. Of course, you can always ask your local station to drop prices because you support Trump.

4220 2018-05-13 21:40:00 seen a tweet about using baby oil to remove fake tan and giving it ago, but at the minute i just feel like a big slippery baby, updates too come 
4221 2018-05-13 21:40:00 Olive oil is good to clean a dirty innie.
4222 2018-05-13 21:39:59 what I do: roast aubergine, red peppers, tomatoes, garlic (whatever you have really). Make couscous with bit of stock, cumin, ground coriander, paprika, lemon juice, olive oil. Griddle halloumi. Add it all together with parsley. Amaaaazing. Also works as a good side with dinner.
4223 2018-05-13 21:39:48 And they say lightning doesn't strike twice. I guess we never learn. While the sudden drop in the price of crude oil was a major cause of our recession, other factors include a flawed FX policy, delay in constituting an economic team and, etc. Buhari largely caused the recession.

4234 2018-05-13 21:37:04 Olive Oil
4235 2018-05-13 21:37:00 I use an air fryer. It's easy to use and only requires a small bit of oil. Don't have to worry too much about cleaning either.
4236 2018-05-13 21:37:00 Prospect for oil at the United States Dept of Agriculture.
4237 2018-05-13 21:36:48 And is Puerto Rico, Flint Michigan WATER, protection of our oceans blocking oil drilling on that list too?

4240 2018-05-13 21:36:21 Oil price is up because he wants sanctions back on Iran. It'll probably go up a lot more if they kick in.

4242 2018-05-13 21:36:05 I am sure once Iran attacks you and they won't now till the gulf is aligned to some islamist idealogy be it MB or themselves, it's not hard to ensure no parts reach you by seeing where you get your parts from? cutting oil supply, looking at anything u need foreign based

4250 2018-05-13 21:34:29 Not snake oil if the vote in parliament goes against the supposed concluded negotiations. The meaningful vote if the six tests are to be believed will mean that to retain the Single Market is the only option. MPs in LP should not do a ‘May’ and put party before country.
4251 2018-05-13 21:34:28 @JeffreeStar i used your beauty killer palette 2 days ago on my eyelids. I have since washed my face 4 times, used oil, and showered. It’s still on my eyes and my kids are stained. What do I do?
4252 2018-05-13 21:34:20 Yeah real important idiot. Oil companies would pay this and more.
4253 2018-05-13 21:34:18 Um, yes, thank you, I do know that. I'm complaining about big money lobbyists who ply Politicians with big money and sway legislation in their favor. Big Pharma, Oil & Gas, NRA.
4254 2018-05-13 21:33:52 That is true. America has the most killings on incident lifes in the world and starting problems between countries and enters into countries that have a civil war and making it 100x worse by so that they can benefit in stealing oil.its all facts iraq Afghanistan somalia ect
4255 2018-05-13 21:33:44 What will happen to the prices when the oil gets back to $100 per barrel?  
4256 2018-05-13 21:33:28 Trump & Iran Deal? If Iran Has Cash Reserves They Should Just STOP Exporting ALL Oil & Gas Letting The Global Markets/Economies Go CRAZY. @JZarif @HassanRouhani @CNNnewsroom @AymanM @AnaCabrera @KasieDC @kasie @SquawkCNBC @SquawkStreet @CSPANwj @MeetThePress @CNNSotu

4258 2018-05-13 21:33:06 no better feelin than using a bath melt and feeling a thin layer of oil settle on my desert dry skin

4260 2018-05-13 21:32:48 Zarif is a total legend, walked in with no leverage or less and walked out with gold. You think you are invisible that's your problem netanyahu and your not, they will eliminate you or else america will need to decide if ur worth global oil shortage and u know those guys lol
4261 2018-05-13 21:32:29 Seriously get your eyes checked. Oil and water mix better than these two.
4262 2018-05-13 21:32:10 I covered the Hook Road etc at the time don’t remember the price of oil being a factor- just public opposition and the need to get re-elected. Long time ago though.
4263 2018-05-13 21:32:02 Do you still think shorting oil on friday was a good idea?
4264 2018-05-13 21:32:01 Whether you like the owner or not - the world needs journalists (IE professionally trained & experienced) now more than ever. Otherwise, we're left with bloggers & snake oil sellers...
4265 2018-05-13 21:31:51 if you’re covered in oil are you wet
4266 2018-05-13 21:31:36 How can the move since March be bearish? Lol. What price turns oil bullish?

4268 2018-05-13 21:31:27 Yes actually. Apparently the olive oil in the sauce burns rather nicely and its a great way to make it looks like an accident.
4269 2018-05-13 21:30:55 So your big conspiracy is that trump pulled out of the Iran deal to help Russian oil prices lol. My goodness, you’re just searching for stuff now. There’s no basis for that.
4270 2018-05-13 21:30:48 Everytime I apply tea tree oil on my face I'm thankful it exists 
4271 2018-05-13 21:30:42 Are you kidding? A diminished US presence on the world stage leaves a vacuum -- one Russia is more than willing to fill. Putin's main goal of a strong Russian Empire is much easier to obtain when the US is navel gazing.

Russia WANTS the cost of oil  via a US Iran deal exit.
4272 2018-05-13 21:30:39 Since when do you care about jobs? Do you know how many American jobs your cancellation of the Iran deal is going to cost? Ask your big friends the oil companies, ask Boeing and if Airbus is smart, they close some US locations so EU jobs will be spared. #MoronInChief
4273 2018-05-13 21:30:37 Yes. He was there today to deliver a sack of cash to Trump. Pulling out of the Iran deal has pushed oil prices higher . Mission accomplished.
4274 2018-05-13 21:30:35 @chigrl and cnbc killed the oil rally
4275 2018-05-13 21:30:34 The Chinese company took over the French TOTAL oil field in Iran. Does the United States allow the Chinese Communist Party to openly engage in business with Iran? Facts have proved that the CCP is the enemy of the American people.

Italian sttle pizza has very little oil in the dough compared to the American style one so it's ok to add a sprinkle on top, it adds a bit of taste!

4285 2018-05-13 21:29:26 Due to high petrol and diesel prices people are using kerosene in their vehicles contributing to more air pollution and Air quality index. Govt.

Well, for one, she stinks of tit sweat and oil!"
4287 2018-05-13 21:28:54 If the gulf is owned by MB with islamist views, your finished as that can be used as bargaining chip to keep america out of the war against israel and every man will take care of it's interest. Plus america won't want to war around oil fields due to global oil shortages

4289 2018-05-13 21:28:10 only oil lobby could hold such sway over mass media as to censor Assad Iran US waged atrocities in Syria and Iraq?
4290 2018-05-13 21:28:00 Get a grip. If we make our foreign policy decisions based upon the cost of gas the U.S. will spend our time being pushed around by every tyrant with a oil well.
4291 2018-05-13 21:27:55 Get some toner and a small bottle of vol 10 developer- it'll help it from being orange and brassy so even if it's too dark after the first time it won't look funny! I also suggest soaking ur hair in coconut oil afterwards since it'll be damaged.
4292 2018-05-13 21:27:42 I’m guessing olive oil. Play off compressed watermelon but Tuna.
4293 2018-05-13 21:27:37 @GMB Hi . Please give some publicity  to the fact that the penguin population is suffering, due to the demand for krill oil,  krill being their main source of food. If they can't get it, they die. Please tell everyone to stop buying it. Thankyoux
4294 2018-05-13 21:27:36 When I waited for cancer results last year, I most appreciated was: face time IRL or virtual, podcast recommendations, calming things (eg lavender oil, soft sleepmask), things to make me laugh. And distractions from effort of being glass half-full.

4297 2018-05-13 21:27:03 My guess as we go forward, similar to what we see with abandoned oil wells, taxpayers will find themselves on the hook for the cleanup costs.

4299 2018-05-13 21:26:25 I thought we were now energy efficient and no longer dependent on Middle Eastern or Russian oil? Why would we allow oil to go to $100 a barrel if were pumping or own oil? Hundred dollar oil will destroy our economy and  thrust the economy in a slowdown in the recession.
4300 2018-05-13 21:26:12 Must have put some oil on the Squeak.

4303 2018-05-13 21:26:07 I blocked the guy, too. I have blocked more of them this weekend than I have in total....they're horrible, and you can't reason with them. They've been brainwashed into submission and that's what they want to do to us. Oil and water.
4304 2018-05-13 21:26:01 Sadly there is as much bullshit coming out of @MayorGregor as there is out of 
@OilGasCanada , you can't trust neither source for real information about the oil/gas industry #cdnpoli #KinderMorgan #climatechange
4305 2018-05-13 21:25:55 What happened to “drill baby drill” to bring the price down, anyone remember that? Did Palin and the GOP lie? So the oil companies sell their oil at market price regardless of where it comes from, yes the GOP lied to us, surprise, surprise!
4306 2018-05-13 21:25:54 Oil money does that..but cant buy fans, passion, and European Royalty.
4307 2018-05-13 21:25:47 @RaveLegend I put nail oil on before watching a video so I would let it dry, and RIGHT when I finish mom tells me dad needs help changing the car oil. #notlikethis

4310 2018-05-13 21:25:18 I am the main oil source come on now.
4311 2018-05-13 21:24:56 Last time I checked, The President does not control oil prices
4312 2018-05-13 21:24:40 It has been estimated the the oil sands in Canada alone contain a 100 year world supply of crude oil.
4313 2018-05-13 21:24:22 What really happened.  
First the earth cooled. And then the dinosaurs came, but they got too big and fat, so they all died and they turned into oil. And then the Arabs came and they bought Mercedes Benzes....
4314 2018-05-13 21:24:03 Cheers, mate!
4315 2018-05-13 21:24:01 They said my only options were fries so  I noticed they had lots of veggies like mushrooms, beets, spinach & mixed greens, broccoli, cauliflower on the salad bar...I mixed up some balsamic vinegar and oil for dressing and made it work #vegan and #healthy
4316 2018-05-13 21:24:00 Yes we should. I have oil ready for use and when you need me i’ll be hanging around.
4317 2018-05-13 21:23:51 I worked and got an oil change today, out here making big moves as a grad

4321 2018-05-13 21:23:13 Nice try Donnie, we all know you are just lining your pockets with oil stocks.
4322 2018-05-13 21:23:10 Let them do just that.  There are others who won’t. Of course oil will be involved
4323 2018-05-13 21:23:06 Okay so I went to the car place for the oil change and inspection.... and guy #1 who i told what i needed didn’t tell guy #2 that i needed an oil change, so he didn’t do it and started working on somebody else’s car, and then he said it’s gonna take 40 more minutes

4325 2018-05-13 21:22:56 So now you lie to do your master bidding! Tell the American people about the Russian attempts to access the Iranian west coast for the oil reserves or how Nethanyu needs something to keep the heat off him like your dumb ass! 
4326 2018-05-13 21:22:54 Tying all their asses to the bed. And hot oil on their bodies while I whoop their ass with a tjambok. And trust me. The wedding will continue and they will continue being bridesmaids. They will attend the wedding. Whether their bodies sore or not.
4327 2018-05-13 21:22:44 I've been more depressed since the BP oil spill and my cousins are here watching "Deepwater Horizon".
4328 2018-05-13 21:22:30 What are you going to do about it? Whatever Putin tell you. That’s right. And that means something that will raise oil prices because that’s how Putin-baby likes it.
4329 2018-05-13 21:22:26 Also also we checked oil and everything and now I have a full safety kit, 2 blankets, rags, and a giant ass trash bag in my car is this what being an adult is like

4334 2018-05-13 21:21:02 People don’t speak the truth on Islamic terrorism because we arm them, we fund them and with our constant bombing of their homelands we provide their motivation. We sacrifice our own to maintain instability in the Middle East,falsely inflating oil prices on behalf of billionaires
4335 2018-05-13 21:20:41 Indeed i did! Would you like some oil to produce your gas.
4336 2018-05-13 21:20:18 It might be time to prepare for $100 — or even $150  —  barrels of oil.
4337 2018-05-13 21:20:16 Non oil GDP. Even as oil GDP bounced back it languished for a while, I haven't checked the last release by NBS but nonoil has struggled.

4342 2018-05-13 21:19:47 A) A mess of 30 yrs and we couldn't clean it for 16yrs. Very plausible. Now how would one expect a new party to clean 30 plus 16 years of mess?
B) of course, military were living large on oil. But boys in agbada came, & what did we do? Shared oil blocks to same military top guys
4343 2018-05-13 21:19:45 Agree with carbon capture. Its soaking $ out of us here . No way any government can make enough jobs to lead the country in job creation.  The oil patch is hiring as oil prices rise.

4346 2018-05-13 21:19:19 Yes but by withdrawing from the Iran deal he drives the price of fuel up. Take a look at what connections tRump and Putin have with the oil industry.
4347 2018-05-13 21:19:13 It does nothing to help the oil and just makes my hair crunchy

4361 2018-05-13 21:17:04 And one thing I forgot, oil prices are the highest they've been in a while and climbing. Who is helped by high oil prices? Why our old friend Vladimir Putin. The recent increase alone will put billions more into the Russian Treasury.
4362 2018-05-13 21:16:59 Apparently there's a huge black market for fake olive oil

4433 2018-05-13 21:06:01 Actually, Oil prices collapsed in 2015 partially due to the Iranian deal and flooding the market with oversupply.

4448 2018-05-13 21:03:41 Yes, oil prices began falling in 2014 and there were immediate job losses.

However, the election of socialist governments and their subsequent anti-energy policies deepened the recession and have led to a nearly jobless recovery in the O&G sector.

4461 2018-05-13 21:01:33 He is leaking oil. Tiger has a legit chance.
4462 2018-05-13 21:01:00 What’s a good tea tree oil to use???
4463 2018-05-13 21:00:56 So give it a rest already. Everyone can see through your bullshit. Except your friends who think you're soooooo cool for being "progressive" and hating the oil companies.
4464 2018-05-13 21:00:47 Try BC powder and rub peppermint oil on your temples . Also if you have a banana put the peel on your neck and forehead (super weird but do it)

4468 2018-05-13 21:00:04 Blessed I’m not allergic to peanuts  cause peanut oil is the way to go for french fries. 
4469 2018-05-13 20:59:58 This won't last Oil is on the decline in terms of growth. And Who is driving the current growths matters.
4470 2018-05-13 20:59:52 Went to a coffee shop in Austin. 

"Do you want a shot of Hemp Oil in your coffee?" 

"Uhhh.............yeah...........yeah I do."
4471 2018-05-13 20:59:46 I remember Standart Oil made dozen of clear public statements, that lead in fuel is an OK thing, and people shouldn't worry. But you have a point. I'm going to wait and see, what will happen. Just saying, that this 180 turnover is suspichious.
4472 2018-05-13 20:59:45 Meanwhile there are tons of other industries (i.e. oil & gas) that are making money hand over fist thru both industry & the market. These ppl are just collateral damage to them.
4473 2018-05-13 20:59:27 Backing out of the Iran deal hurts this nation, our allies, n further destabilizes the Middle East. Gas prices will jump n terrorist attacks climb. The likelihood Iran attacks Israel is high n then we’re drug into a potential world war. Who profits? Oil Barron’s? You? Saudis?
4474 2018-05-13 20:59:06 Chumps. 
"In 2016, the five largest oil sands projects in the Ft McMurray region (Syncrude, two Suncor mines, Imperial Oil, and Cenovus) paid an average royalty of 1.4% of gross revenues. An energy economist: “You can’t get lower than these rates without giving it away for free.”
4475 2018-05-13 20:59:04 Jb peterson is to economic wisdom as oil is to?

Water.
4476 2018-05-13 20:58:52 To my mind they are best roasted whole at about 400F tossed in olive oil and a little sea salt. The bulbs end up sweet, the leaves crispy. Perfect.

4483 2018-05-13 20:57:55 Rubbed lavender oil on my temples so I can study through my headache but now I just smell like a potent incense shop
4484 2018-05-13 20:57:36 Let’s do this.  They do have good ketchup but if we don’t stand for something we will fall!!!  Try sliced tomato w/ pepper and drizzled olive oil as replacement on burgers/sandwiches requiring.  And try a bbq or substitute sauce for fries and tots.  It WILL hurt a lil.
4485 2018-05-13 20:57:14 It's not only People's Republic of China that Trump is making great again. Russia benefited from the rising oil prices after Trump pulled out of the Iran deal as well. True patriot, Trump is!

4491 2018-05-13 20:56:44 The only reason why the whole world watched them get slaughtered was because they were muslims and didn't have rich oil reserves.
4492 2018-05-13 20:56:40 Did You Know?

If you sleep with a bottle of rosemary essential oil under your pillow, in the morning your septum will have pierced itself
4493 2018-05-13 20:56:36 I just ate a potato that was baked n then fried in coconut oil with lots of spices so I'm feeling better
4494 2018-05-13 20:56:09 I had a makeup artist do my make up today. 9 hours later and my face is still oil and shine free. I also have an amazing glow. Currently beating myself up for not getting the name of which foundation she used on me :( 

It’s literally magic -my face has never looked so good!
4495 2018-05-13 20:55:51 There’s not a brain cell or any moral fibre in any of those charlatans. Don’t even mention that snake oil salesman Rees-Mogg. He’d sell his mother for a shilling.

4502 2018-05-13 20:54:38 There's a lot of snake oil around blockchain tech. If a project isn't taking advantage of the specific set of benefits provided by using a blockchain then it's probably not viable
4503 2018-05-13 20:54:37 Coconut oil is great and everything but sometimes I dont want to walk around looking like a glazed butterball turkey 
4504 2018-05-13 20:54:35 Its fairly easy for me to avoid palm oil as I don't buy much processed food but there are some things I was buying like scots porrage oats and quaker oats and Magnums which I can't buy anymore cause they are pepsico and unilever. I really wanted to try a praline Magnum today
4505 2018-05-13 20:54:31 @ pours hot oil on me? How is that not kinky, Sir...
4506 2018-05-13 20:54:00 Maybe you should protest the oil we import from countries with worse enviromental rules and worse human rights.
4507 2018-05-13 20:53:49 There are very few Mayos that don't contain soybean oil no matter what's on the front of the label.

4509 2018-05-13 20:53:44 In Latin, the foul-smelling and bitter residue left behind in making olive oil was known as amurca.

It is like they knew.

4513 2018-05-13 20:53:18 Great deal Don! Foreign companies have been given 90 days to get out, oil prices rising, nuclear inspectors not allowed in. Has all the signs of another Iraq, time again for regime change?

I would like to start oil and Gas consultancy company. Kindly provide your kind attention.
4518 2018-05-13 20:52:01 Is it moimoi elewe or nylon.If its elewe nd its still in d pot and on fire add d groudnut oil at d edges of d moimoi in d pot and let it cook for smtime D oil will seep into d moimoi cos d leaf is never tightly closed My grandma has done it b4.. If its nylon. Den no idea. Thank u
4519 2018-05-13 20:51:56 That “I rub huh down in oil” move was  one of my best to date 
4520 2018-05-13 20:51:51 Is this what faux news told you?  Or Bolton? Or netanyahoo?

The only one trying to take over the Middle East are the American war hawks who want their blood money and oil.
4521 2018-05-13 20:51:48 ５時台から電車に乗ってる社畜のみなさーーーん
4522 2018-05-13 20:51:26 For the umpteenth fucking time, it was their own money and now that there is no deal for the US, Iran can pretty much do what ever they want. Russia is happy with the rising oil prices and Trump's only option will be war. How dumb is that?
4523 2018-05-13 20:50:57 How come with all the lootings under Past government Nigeria never went into any recession?  Apc took over & nigeria was first hit with increase in oil price, many things. Policies changed, recession surfaced.why cant some people reason like sensible humans
4524 2018-05-13 20:50:50 Indeed. It just gets more and more difficult to shop ethically, healthily, affordably. Even products that don't have palm oil in need to be avoided if they are from companies that are on the esp naughty list.
4525 2018-05-13 20:50:47 I just ordered some cbd oil tablets to help me sleep too. Glad to hear it works 
4526 2018-05-13 20:50:40 And rightly so, did they congratulate City for their achievement?
And the ones slagging off AW are the ones who want us to buy success.

Oil well

See ya
4527 2018-05-13 20:50:36 Buhari just appointed Mele Kyari, Abba Kyari's younger brother who's  GGM crude oil marketing division at NNPC as Nigeria's OPEC National Rep. 
Meanwhile Abba Kyari's is an Executive director NNPC  Board. 
Surely, there's no Nigerian qualified for NNPC but the Kyari's.
4528 2018-05-13 20:50:28 I love the solar idea. Agreed oil is part of the swamp. Greed. Root of all evil.
4529 2018-05-13 20:50:21 Can't help thinking that patronising a distinguished ex Army officer, and addressing him by his first name without permission, is not the best way to oil the wheels. I always call him "Sir".

4532 2018-05-13 20:49:49 Eat the caribou! Drill for oil.
4533 2018-05-13 20:49:33 Median household income up 5.3%. Crude oil production up 77%. Crime down 16%. Don't know where you learned about economics, but these are signs of a growing, not failed economy.

4535 2018-05-13 20:49:12 Marchese went out for that canola oil. You enjoy your assholes.

By the way Dustin, pretty sure you can say good-bye to that sponsorship for coconut water.

4540 2018-05-13 20:48:56 And I'm sure you've read somewhere, being a journalist and all, that oil is now trading at over $70 a barrel.
4541 2018-05-13 20:48:50 OIL OIL OIL . と紙に書くとサザエさんに聞こえる。
4542 2018-05-13 20:48:43 @realDonaldTrump wants to bring whale oil back.
4543 2018-05-13 20:48:41 Ohh and an example "As for ur argument about western tribes residing in east willing to kill all Barqa for their cousins.." Hafter & his supporters of military council are doing this now by accepting the status quo and opposing federalism/seperation & handing over oil.
4544 2018-05-13 20:48:34 1st half was a perfect example. No one hit shots & LeBron's fadeaways didn't fall. If they don't get secondary scoring, they won't win. It worked against the Pacers but it wouldn't have worked against the Raptors & certainly not against a team that plays D like the Celtics.
4545 2018-05-13 20:48:24 BC had bad wildfires last summer & flooding this spring. And another kind of battle is raging re pipeline expansion from Alberta oilsands to the Vancouver area for export. BC faces significant backlash over protests re this b/c of oil industry influence. #TransMountain #TMX

4548 2018-05-13 20:48:11 Good chance Crude oil hits close to $100 a barrel this year. 2019 elections will be bloody. These guys will fight hard to retain power.
4549 2018-05-13 20:47:59 Oil loving albertans think corporations will take care of it. Even if they do take care of it. They will use those man-hour tax as a business expense to revenue Canada and who will fund the cleaning cost? The Whole Canada.
4550 2018-05-13 20:47:53 This is cute but how will the poor squirrel get the oil off
4551 2018-05-13 20:47:50 @POTUS do you know what I have found strange is.Oil prices go up and up plusthe price of College,the middle class family these thingshurt us the most getting a few dollars back in taxes in pay check is not much help while the ritch oil boy get richer,so let’s help middle class F
4552 2018-05-13 20:47:44 Oil is only really a major sector for Norway, but the other nations are heavy in other commodities but a lot of that is state owned so benefits go back into welfare state and education.
4553 2018-05-13 20:47:41 Ford is the one who will mess up Ontario with a load of freebie promises that will cost over 12 billion. How will he pay for them? also contradicts himself, ie says the min wage hike was a job killer. Ok if that's true then why isn't he lowering it back to 11.60?  He's snake oil
4554 2018-05-13 20:47:28 Rationale - oil & water 
4555 2018-05-13 20:47:17 This lawn mower would carve my hand up like a Christmas day ham if I dare shove it in the rotating blades, but roll over a patch of 6 inch grass and it sputters out like your grandma's 1986 Chrysler Lebaron after she switched out the motor oil with a blend of Crisco and Vasoline.
4556 2018-05-13 20:47:05 And you dont get affordable HC through an oil/gas company? Again that's odd. Are they a small company?
4557 2018-05-13 20:46:58 It's not the problem what saddam does concerns irakis. USA killed millions destroyed a whole country and provoked a terrible turmoil in ME (Many in US can not even place IRAK on a map )for fake reasons (a shameless huge lie)for the good of oil and Israel.
4558 2018-05-13 20:46:58 Imagine being a full on Corbyn supporting socialist and then supporting a football club owned by an oil barren 
4559 2018-05-13 20:46:57 Awesome!! The key is affordability for all Americans and job training.  What are your views on natural gas??? Total independence from foreign oil would be great for the USA.
4560 2018-05-13 20:46:53 Another vote for the Air Fryer. It makes nice chicken. Would like a proper deep fat fryer, but still has the attendant hassle of loads of oil and what to do with it. Both options preferable to a pan of oil, though: that’s dangerous!
4561 2018-05-13 20:46:51 The problem with Thatcherism, is you eventually run out of North Sea oil
4562 2018-05-13 20:46:49 "Ok Hisham whatever I honestly lost U and I dont even know what ur seperatist argument is any more, oil trumps tribalism or tribalism trumps oil. " I'm at lost at your loss.

4567 2018-05-13 20:46:30 I just can't stand stuff made on a base of palmitate (cf. "palm oil"). I blame a bad experience w/Reese's Military Rations a few years ago for that.
4568 2018-05-13 20:46:13 Price of oil is going up of course that's good who
4569 2018-05-13 20:46:09 For those with dehydrated oily skin, if it gets dry throughout the day, what’s saved me is having a small spritz bottle made up on distilled water, aloe vera juice, vegetable glycerin, and sunflower oil.

It’s a life changer.

4577 2018-05-13 20:45:04 Iran exports over 2.5 mil barrels of oil a day, at $70 per barrel, that's'$175 mil per day.
Iran has 80 mil population, where's that money going?
Into their military and terrorists around the world.
4578 2018-05-13 20:45:02 Rosneft. Dotard is paying off Putin with high oil prices. Only way the Russian economy can survive is by lighting the Middle East on fire and denying clean energy in the West. Nostradumbass’s “energy policy” is a Russian kickback.
4579 2018-05-13 20:44:27 "And if ur saying that Haftar reopening oil fields for NOC unconditionally is Tribalism rather than Nationalism dunno what else to say" Yes, Hafter opening OIl fields for Serraj & Kabier CBL is tribalisim.

4588 2018-05-13 20:43:11 It's possible, but there would be a lot of planning involved. And lots of cooking oil.
4589 2018-05-13 20:42:47 Hot oil treatment and studying. About to order some pizza 
4590 2018-05-13 20:42:46 My mom got me a cat mug, face wipes, and body oil for mother’s day since I’m at cat mom 
4591 2018-05-13 20:42:39 
4592 2018-05-13 20:42:38 Today win pirelli and fia who favorited Mercedes and oil burning Ferrari don’t smoke anymore. Oil burning and Mercedes pirelli fia rules today win. This is not f1 anymore but formula Mercedes.
4593 2018-05-13 20:42:31 Buhari and his cabals are gradually turning NNPC to their Private Property. 
Buhari =Minister for petroleum. 
Abba Kyari =Chief of staff to Buhari. 
Abba  Kyari =Executive director NNPC Board
Mele Kyari(Abba Kyari's Younger brother) = GGM Crude oil Marking Div. NNPC and OPEC Rep.
4594 2018-05-13 20:42:25 OIL, WHAT IN GOOD GOD'S NAME DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH RAILROADS
4595 2018-05-13 20:42:23 That's because there was no mahem. 
We that support the oil and gas industry are not about causing trouble when we stand up and fight for our voices to be heard.
4596 2018-05-13 20:41:56 Nope my pay check comes for the oil and natural gas industry. It did come from the DOD for 6 years but that's behind me
4597 2018-05-13 20:41:44 Dude, without the recent oil bump we'd be in the hole compared to November 2016.
4598 2018-05-13 20:41:32 I'd personally look at @osmo_uk oil as it doesn't penetrate enough to damage the veneer. But there are other great products out there - mike
4599 2018-05-13 20:41:17 Nobel Peace Prizes in a "Perpetual War & Only Oil" economy don't mean shit. 
The Military Industrial Complex has been here since JFK
& it has called the shots for Clinton, Bush, Obama & Trump.
...but adults sure love fantasy land.
4600 2018-05-13 20:41:03 Members of "Team Rocket" is predicting "Oil Tot" going to play the entire album in a future live stream 
4601 2018-05-13 20:40:57 How is the price of a barrel of oil since you took office ? It has doubled Donald! and lets not say it is fake news dumb ass it is fact!
4602 2018-05-13 20:40:52 Just spent the past two hours anxious about using shampoo with almond oil. So far still breathing #allergies #sigh
4603 2018-05-13 20:40:51 i use cartel cold brew to oil up my creaky joints
4604 2018-05-13 20:40:40 Cant teach it oil and the one i let three run past me and got the flag cap
4605 2018-05-13 20:40:38 Lots of salmon, steak, bacon, eggs, butter, avocados, nuts and MCT oil. 
4606 2018-05-13 20:40:23 On May 13, 1935 the first major gusher blew in at the Seven Sisters oilfield. Thus began the town of Seven Sisters in northern Duval County. Prospectors struck oil again 2 years later, and the community had a post office by 1940. Seven Sisters, Eagle Hill & Freer became legends.
4607 2018-05-13 20:40:15 No. I don’t Remember that. I do remember you saying you would have taken the oil!
4608 2018-05-13 20:40:09 えるしっているか、遠藤氏は油しか飲まない。
4609 2018-05-13 20:39:57 Well..as long as it benefits you and Ivanka, and Putin ( partner of Chinese oil co. To drill in Alaska). Who does @realDonaldTrump think he’s fooling.
4610 2018-05-13 20:39:52 He needs to stop putting baby oil in his hair
4611 2018-05-13 20:39:36 
4612 2018-05-13 20:39:33 Oil palm has a fraction (<50%) of the insects of the forest. It gets attacked by ganoderma rot (& needs minerals & salicylic acid to deal with it).The natural forest has disease resistant wood. Defend sustainable #oilpalm but not because monocultures are great, they're really not
4613 2018-05-13 20:39:20 Webb staring to leak a bit of oil at the moment… 
4614 2018-05-13 20:39:16 Only 6 back, and Simpson is leaking oil....
4615 2018-05-13 20:39:12 why 3
4616 2018-05-13 20:39:04 I could live off of bread n olive oil
4617 2018-05-13 20:39:01 Hey! Your facts are incorrect. Have never lobbied for oil. As a foster mom, I’m proud to support Mary. She is a fellow foster mom, and she has a proven track record of success at the legislature. Nothing against her opponent, but Mary is my pick.
4618 2018-05-13 20:38:58 One of them slicked his fingers in oil and shoved them up Alvo’s ass.
4619 2018-05-13 20:38:17 You should study a possible oil deal without making them loose , we don’t kick them when they are down they need the resources to survive
4620 2018-05-13 20:38:12 I understand. Honestly I was not begin rude.....But the ME countries insist that the oil is a national resource but the profits don't filter down to the average man like the profit sharing they have in Alaska or the fund created in Norway.
4621 2018-05-13 20:38:02 Philips Air Fryer. No oil, has a basket like a deep fryer. Makes great fried chicken, and all sorts of stuff.
4622 2018-05-13 20:37:58 I love these. My gran makes them quite often when I go home. They're pretty labour-intensive, but worth the effort. The steamed version with a bit of oil is also great.
4623 2018-05-13 20:37:52 I’ve heard flaxseed oil is the best for reducing the amount of “stick”.
4624 2018-05-13 20:37:43 Who got oil on pullup
4625 2018-05-13 20:37:39 The itchiness can be annoying but it’s normal. Your body is healing + the laser takes all of the moisture out. Coconut oil can help. Good luck!
4626 2018-05-13 20:37:27 you wonder why
you ask me questions
never bothering to listen
explanations, excuses
you toss the words aside
like they mean nothing
i guess they just don't for you
you push aside the obvious
never wanting to admit defeat
my oil, your water
just going around
skirting the problem
4627 2018-05-13 20:37:25 @TaylorTwellman rest assured, @TimbersFC supporters know @DiegoChara21 is the oil of our engine #RCTID
4628 2018-05-13 20:37:24 And I bet your happy about that. Oil up over 50% and companies pulling out of Canada oil patch? I wonder why? @JustinTrudeau has failed all Canadians on this one. Oil employs  countless cdns. Not to mention all the royalties/taxes that help us pay for healthcare/education
4629 2018-05-13 20:37:20 Buhari controls the oil price...he even reduced the oil price to $27 per barrel...and cut our production to 500,000 barrels per day...Dr., you are a disaster yourself with this assertion.
4630 2018-05-13 20:36:31 OIL CENTURIONS
4631 2018-05-13 20:36:23 Got a box myself in my loft with The Beat and Raw Power/Noisy Mothers (burned a lot of midnight oil in those days with late night music shows.
4632 2018-05-13 20:36:00 Here is why I'm single. I enjoy my own presence and continue to improve myself. Being independent means you gain skills like cooking, building IKEA furniture, checking engine oil etc. You just learn to love yourself more. It's like being a Beta version before you hit the market
4633 2018-05-13 20:35:57 bro, the only thing healthy i ate today was the lettuce on that burger, the "vegetable" oil used for the fries, the strawberry in that cheesecake, & the cherry in that coke  filthy 
4634 2018-05-13 20:35:40 Depot s are the place where the loot of oil begins for dealer .they don't bother to pick phones.for there complaints.
4635 2018-05-13 20:35:38 They are missing open looks because the shots they want arent available.
4636 2018-05-13 20:35:32 We're u gunna be on the 26th when Hendo is lifting the cl enjoy ur oil money can buy u the prem but gets u no where in Europe

4638 2018-05-13 20:35:11 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?
4639 2018-05-13 20:35:06 Praying for your recovery. I am a 4 year survivor of (GBM). When first diagnosed, 18 mths was the life expectancy. I read my Bible and CLAIMED PROMISES written in James 5:14-15. I asked to be anointed with oil & for prayers by elders. God put me in remission. U can claim healing2
4640 2018-05-13 20:35:04 Och aye, ave aye been interestit in the North East; it's such a bonny place an the history's fascinatin, a grew up jist sooth o the Marr coontae border in Glenshee. Ma auld niebours were fae up Deeside way, Doric speakers that must o moved doon afore the oil boom an that.
4641 2018-05-13 20:35:00 Shup was still baby oil, maybe that’s why I felt slimier
4642 2018-05-13 20:34:44 The Coconut oil as they bake, smells Lush

4646 2018-05-13 20:34:22 While we're all about transparency, maybe the oil companies could share al, the data they have on climate change; including how long they've been studying it and what they think it will cost us.  They've been lying to us for decades.
4647 2018-05-13 20:34:21 but i take care of my hoes buy bundles, bags and oil
4648 2018-05-13 20:33:43 Vaseline/castor oil before bed
4649 2018-05-13 20:33:41 Grilled with olive oil and garlic
4650 2018-05-13 20:33:02 I either add peppermint or orange oil to taste
4651 2018-05-13 20:33:00 How? You and Israel are trying to take over the Middle East. You’ve tried to destroy Syria, destroyed Iraq and Yemen and the most civilised country in Africa - Libya for oil and gold. Iran has done nothing, you imposed the previous government and now they are the enemy. Oil&Israe
4652 2018-05-13 20:32:45 Shaving and then covering my entire body in coconut oil and getting into freshly washed bed sheets brings me ultimate happiness
4653 2018-05-13 20:32:45 Out of all the oil treatments I’ve used on my hair nothing compares to coconut oil 
4654 2018-05-13 20:32:33 What? You mean the only country left in the Arabian gulf the US doesn’t have control over? The same area of the world which would control most of the worlds oil and pipelines? Is it any wonder they are tired of your shit? This is about oil not Nukes.
4655 2018-05-13 20:32:24 Oil
4656 2018-05-13 20:32:18 Down with this sort of thing? What will become of the poor oil multinationals if this kind of thing catches on? Just say no!
4657 2018-05-13 20:32:18 I would suggest a smoothie with cacao and mct oil. Both good for mood and brain. Heaped tbsp cacao, tbsp mct. Also maca root powder is good. Everyday it helps me
4658 2018-05-13 20:32:01 Is there a glut of condos? This doesn't seem like an accurate statement to me. More like there was a brief 2-year pause due to total collapse of oil.

Btw, since this is Twitter, I'll explain I'm not being antagonistic, just wondering your source of info & discussing.
4659 2018-05-13 20:31:37 I was already excited that I get to go to the Show Me 100 this year but now I got to take Chris to his first Lucas Oil late model race and I’m soooo hype 
4660 2018-05-13 20:31:36 @KRLS Enjoy that olive oil from Az-Azeytun it is really good.
4661 2018-05-13 20:31:28 Rest of paragraph
It had fog almost every night and along the shore the moaning of the oil well machinery and the slap of dark water in the canals and the hiss of sand against the windows of your house when the wind came up and sang among the open places and along the empty walks
4662 2018-05-13 20:31:26 My neosporin melted in the car and I’ve been using it as cuticle oil 
4663 2018-05-13 20:31:25 once you speak 

bullshit reek 

like oil leak
4664 2018-05-13 20:31:24 Oil oil oil!
4665 2018-05-13 20:31:20 As in I'm tired of celebrating,I celebrate my mum daily
4666 2018-05-13 20:31:06 I would love to add an anchovy., lemon juice, clove of garlic, oil, white beans. For garbanzo beans I also add tahinni and for black bean, I add lime juice. Love hummus.
4667 2018-05-13 20:31:02 Ok Hisham whatever I honestly lost U and I dont even know what ur seperatist argument is any more, oil trumps tribalism or tribalism trumps oil. And if ur saying that Haftar reopening oil fields for NOC unconditionally is Tribalism rather than Nationalism dunno what else to say
4668 2018-05-13 20:30:56 Omc will never do this .they save huge amount by giving just with dip.although when TT is filling on bay when feed 4kl they take out the oil if it is above the dip point.and if it is short told the TT driver to stand for half hour it just reaches the dip mark .so all temp game
4669 2018-05-13 20:30:48 OJALÁ ASI COMO PIDIERON LA QUIEBRA DE OIL POR DEUDA EN EVASIÓN FISCAL
TAMBIÉN PIDAN QUIEBRA DE SHELL POR LA EVASIÓN FISCAL DE ARANGUREN Y VAYA A CÁRCEL! 
LEY PAREJA, NO RIGUROSA.

Please give me money!
4673 2018-05-13 20:30:34 How do you explain the .77 cent raise in gas since you took office? That drains the average small tax break you gave back to Americans and sucks more than that out into the pockets of your oil industry people.  You deregulate the EPA and gas is going UP? You are a fraud.
4674 2018-05-13 20:30:34 Thanks for the higher gas & oil prices.  Great for America.

4676 2018-05-13 20:30:27 let's not forget that immediately after announcing oil prices spiked and directly benefiting Russia; they were close to the brink of another financial collapse mostly due to their intervention in Syria.  Trump is Making Russia Great Again and they even thanked him
4677 2018-05-13 20:30:25 Maybe they can move to Russia and work in their oil industry. Trump just saved a ton of jobs there thanks to breaking our treaty with Iran. #cuckholdPresidentsellout
4678 2018-05-13 20:30:19 Yes! Oil, basil and a little Marjoram. Plus a bit of salt and pepper :p
4679 2018-05-13 20:30:11 On what specifically? Almond pollination issue is a US farming one. I'm sure some vegans avoid US almonds, much like others avoid palm oil, as we 'seek to exclude forms of exploitation & cruelty'. I drink oat milk though. No calves & mums separated there. Environmentally better.
4680 2018-05-13 20:30:06 @MichaelAvenatti Squire Patton Boggs makes plenty of sense when you consider who else they work for, among them Sinopec, the Chinese oil company that's about to start drillin the crap out of Alaska. Sinopec is also Rosneft's partner
4681 2018-05-13 20:30:05 To select a healthy cooking oil, look for expeller- pressed or cold-pressed oils to ensure you are buying high-quality, undamaged oil. Oi...
4682 2018-05-13 20:29:58 BINGO. Hussein was our boy until he started talking about creating his own oil bourse, and inking deals with France ' s Total, etc.
4683 2018-05-13 20:29:38 Canadians need remember this next time the oil corps are crying about business!
4684 2018-05-13 20:29:33 That oil?
4685 2018-05-13 20:29:33 It’s just a bunch of oil. 
Sausage would be a better choice in terms of flavor. And I don’t mind mind veggies on pizza (depends what it is)
4686 2018-05-13 20:29:07 That’s our bio chain oil sorted for another year.
4687 2018-05-13 20:29:06 HAHAHA!
4688 2018-05-13 20:29:03 The husband just left to fill up my car with gas and to get the oil changed. Best Mother’s Day. #YASSSSS
4689 2018-05-13 20:28:49 Wasn't that the USA  "trying to take over the Middle East by whatever means necessary."?
After WW2 Iran basically wanted to be left alone, but they had oil.  So UK and USA engineered a take over to put a more compliant leader in place.
So  why is Iran so anti- US government?
4690 2018-05-13 20:28:46 Borehole, vegetable oil, rice, Akara, wheelbarrow, indomie and eggs, etc
4691 2018-05-13 20:28:42 They did behave and respected the agreement. You terminated it without a solid alternative...what's next? War for Oil?
4692 2018-05-13 20:28:41 LOL.... ok guess thats why were always bailing other countries out.  So what part world you from?  Ones we kicked Ass on in WW 2 or one whom asses we Saved?   Dieing... lol   Hmmm guess thats why were still Number 1 in GDP economy wise in world.  Trade oil with USA Dollars..lol
4693 2018-05-13 20:28:34 Because of YOUR Middle East destabilization efforts, the cost of oil/gas will go up. This directly benefits Russia and harms the average US worker.
4694 2018-05-13 20:28:19 $10 dollar car wash and $80 oil change. I made that money overnight. I spent it just like that. Being an Uber driver sometimes is not worth it.
4695 2018-05-13 20:28:16 The #President of #Ghana, @NAkufoAddo  during a speech at  @uniOfOxford announced his #government will spend some GHS 453 million (USD103 million) of the country’s #oil #revenue on #funding #FreeSHS program. #OilAndGas #oil #gas #exploration  #HighSchool #education #economy..
4696 2018-05-13 20:28:09 Hi Tom, it’s a dust filter used to reduce clogging of the radiator and oil cooler. Was fitted for operations during spring-autumn from rough strips.
4697 2018-05-13 20:27:37 And try to boycott anything containing palm oil x
4698 2018-05-13 20:27:36 When I catch Koole, God please let him wear white that day so I can wipe my palm oil hands on his shirt.
4699 2018-05-13 20:27:31 Just because Israel tell you Americans jump and you shame always telling a lie just because of war to get money from oil and othersI don't know how you Americans thinks 9/11 all lies but still you don't see anything wrong with your leaders God will judge you
4700 2018-05-13 20:26:55 People who use fryers: any preferred brands? I want to make fried chicken, but I don't like the mess a regular pan and oil makes.
4701 2018-05-13 20:26:45 Well done Sheikh oil city
4702 2018-05-13 20:26:40 You would think with the U.S. shipping all the oil overseas that we could haave enough here to keep our prices down!
4703 2018-05-13 20:26:35 No. Your tweet is a lie and propaganda. According to our own Intel, they were in compliance. Putin, your boss, wanted you to violate the deal, so the price of oil would go up.
4704 2018-05-13 20:26:32 พวกเราคือ ครอบครัวค่ะ 
4705 2018-05-13 20:26:27 Going soon if Kate saves up fast xx
4706 2018-05-13 20:26:25 In TT Elevator... Al-Rumaihi is a former Qatari ambassador in 2016 took over QAI investment fund. QAI purchased an 18+% stake in the Russian oil Rosneft. Rosneft says that Trump entitled to 19.5% commission of sale!!  Price of oil rises as U pullout of Iran Deal = Bigger Payday!!
4707 2018-05-13 20:26:15 While Africom's priorities are CT, the EU's priorities are a militarised form of policing in much of the region. The moves on the oil smuggling business link operations from Amsterdam to Naples to Malta to Misrata to Sebha
4708 2018-05-13 20:26:15 Keen to really embrace #MondayMotivation tomorrow? Get an early night. Tear yourself away from the telly & start the new week with a spring in your step. All the quinoa & coconut oil in the world won't help if you're going short on shut-eye.

4711 2018-05-13 20:25:10 Oil Refinery Factory: வேளாண் மண்டலம் இனி சமாதி மண்டபம்
4712 2018-05-13 20:25:04 This fellow is delusional.  Another example of thinking the noble thing to do is to buy foreign oil, leave our resources in the ground so that we do not contribute 0.001 percent to world CO2.  Meanwhile, Canadians suffer with less good paying jobs and  national revenue!
4713 2018-05-13 20:25:02 I am going off story just got gas $3.49 a gal.! DC folks have no idea what we pay 4 gas or heating oil...diesel is $3.49 /gal. in Williams Valley of PA. Saw a couple filling their 5gal cans with heating oil think of the cost to us...250gal oil tank $872.00 to fill a tank!

4716 2018-05-13 20:24:44 #BestAdviceYourMomGave
Use oil to cook not butter
4717 2018-05-13 20:24:20 Been waiting for this too long, I don’t take medicines at all, but this is great for those who do.  Look @ the kaiser system & incetivate competition on that concept. Better use of resources+proactive vs reactive health approach. It’s cheaper do oil change than engine repair.
4718 2018-05-13 20:24:10 Just an old mama comfort food, ground beef, pasta and veggie goolash thing.  But alwys starts w garlic and onions in olive oil
4719 2018-05-13 20:23:57 Ha!  We killed a bunch of Ruskies in Syria.  We're going after their ally Iran.  We're producing a ton of oil, which hurts Russia.

4721 2018-05-13 20:23:51 The racist trump pulled out of the iran deal to keep his promises for oil companies money. Met with ceo's during the election and guaranteed that he would get the price of oil above 350 gal. Kaos in the Mideast best way to do it. Pay for play is the racist trump way.
4722 2018-05-13 20:23:41 As an Iranian I would say thank you #ThankYouTrump. Please cut off their oil.
4723 2018-05-13 20:23:35 Yeah doubt that. What oil pipe do you gain of this?
4724 2018-05-13 20:23:34 Well, that will eat up any little dribble that might trickle down to the working class, even though we still have a glut in the oil market. Frustrating.
4725 2018-05-13 20:23:25 Nonsense, they are doing business, and US companies can't compete. Your behaviour is only in benefits of US oil companies, and the people in US and worldwide will have to pay higher prices.
4726 2018-05-13 20:23:11 Nothing to do with redacted owning the oil port depots into Ireland or is my info old due to his selling of topaz? Pls update me if wrong

4729 2018-05-13 20:22:31 Hey girlie! Yes ma’am, I have to oil his scalp every night bcuz of his eczema. I use a mix of coconut, jojoba, vitamin e, lavender, peppermint & tea tree oils. I also have tried shea moisture’s kids mango & carrot conditioner, but I consistently use Trader Joe’s tea tree
4730 2018-05-13 20:22:23 THAT'S BECAUSE HE PUT OUR COUNTRY'S NATIONAL SECURITY AT RISK. Violating the Iran deal puts the USA & world in new danger AND, it allows Russia to exert more power over Middle East region and oil.

4734 2018-05-13 20:21:54 You are the one who wants to take over the Middle East by any means necessary.  Your motives are clear: you want their oil. Like you said about Iraq 'we shoud have kept their oil'  You're the one who breached a multinational agreement.
4735 2018-05-13 20:21:46 That's not for dry skin, it's for removing dark marks....
For dry skin use oils such as olive oil, coconut oil or tissue oil.

4743 2018-05-13 20:20:22 It wasn't bad. :) But I was a kid everything is nice when you are a kid. My memories of Yugoslavia are all good. Some shortage of oil and suger here and there but overall beats this c*ap for sure.
4744 2018-05-13 20:20:13 Liar, all because you and Saudi Arabia willing to Sell Aramco stocks in market and you need 100 $ oil price!

4756 2018-05-13 20:17:35 This was Native land , owned by NAs , encroached upon by big oil because they wouldn't expose white residents to the very real possibility of a spillage. NAs lives obviously matter less .
4757 2018-05-13 20:17:23 Did you back out of the deal so oil prices will skyrocket and you own oil co stock? Or because your besties own oil stocks?

4760 2018-05-13 20:17:06 Imagine you're Iran leader and sitting 100 km away from the oil fields of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, UAE then USA sanctions you from selling oil and these bastards want to sell more oil! This will not end well.
4761 2018-05-13 20:16:53 By breaking the Iran deal and imposing sanctions the price of oil will go up.  This will raise our has prices.

But oil going up helps Putin a great deal.  Russia's economy is 50% oil-based. 

Hmmmmm....

So why vote for Peeps who don’t look after their own Peeps?
Is this virus or something?! How stupid can UK Peeps get

4770 2018-05-13 20:15:34 Tried to get my babes car an oil change today. Went to 7 different fucking places and None of them were available. And the last one tried to tell me they'd do it for $67. 
4771 2018-05-13 20:15:27 I'm more irritated that I actually bothered to change the oil in those two piece of shit pressure washers before making sure either one of them would run. Of course they don't run, I tried to maintain them.
4772 2018-05-13 20:15:20 Trump’s decoy plan has worked anyway.  His supporters are so busy attacking a porn star they aren’t noticing he is giving Russia the oil market control Putin wanted.  And committed America to buying Chinese spy phones.          Stop bothering Stormy and Mike.

4795 2018-05-13 20:11:45 Maybe some oil/greace from the spindle, or maybe a kind of air tight seal on the edges. Though if it's leaking outside I'd worry it's sitting on the platter and would crash the head.
4796 2018-05-13 20:11:43 Ok.. MoiMoi is almost done. 

We just remembered we didn't put groundnut/palm oil
4797 2018-05-13 20:11:32 Because other religions aren't controlling the territories where a majority of our oil supply comes from, and thus there isn't the same temptation to demonize them as a precursor for potential resource grabs in the form of war.

4812 2018-05-13 20:09:01 Yes it will unlikely be relisted. There there were too many derampers here who had a vendetta against the company, and they scored an own goal by making themselves excluded from this party. The ceo is looking out for genuine investors by protecting us from the toxic market

4818 2018-05-13 20:08:11 Dear Art,The volatility of oil price was mainly caused by oil import nations refusing to publishing inventory data in a timely manner. EIA WEEKLY DATA is all we have,how we could price oil correctly, as a global commodity only based on USA data? This is the root of volatility.

4823 2018-05-13 20:06:56 Omg that sounds good with the oil 
4824 2018-05-13 20:06:27 Good example, Hafter handed over Oil to his “enemies” depriving Barqa of a critical asset and negotiating tool for nothing in return. I.e. Tribe trumps Finance.
4825 2018-05-13 20:06:21 Venezuela is pretty awful but is also a pretty classic failed petro-state. Oil as a source of national wealth has a really bad track record of misuse, authoritarianism, corruption, and continued poverty for most people in the nation. The exception is, what, Norway? Scotland?
4826 2018-05-13 20:05:55 Ratio just about right for this post at the twilight of the oil economy.

4835 2018-05-13 20:04:04 I find it highly highly encouraging. No doubt at all we've got better than eb1. No deramper can be satisfied, if there was jars of oil they call it a scam, if there's no jars it's a scam. FYI, there is purposefully no mention of oil or flow. Lips sealed #usop

4841 2018-05-13 20:03:35 My two cents on this: first of all, we have insolvent states who cannot generate revenue on their own this depending on oil money. Then we have an economy more dependent on imports than on export. Then we have pmb. That mixture sums up your theory on our recession

4861 2018-05-13 19:59:59 #usop Parrot. Oil staining is an excellent sign. If you check, many oilies dont actually report flow rates directly from the drill rig. They wait for testing and completion with a seperate rig, which is what will happen here, you don't complete a well with a main drill rig.

4882 2018-05-13 19:56:51 Watch YouTube videos and stockpile recipes. I recommend starting with things that you can prep for the week so when you feel like shit, you don't have to also cook. General guideline is stay under 50g carbs a day and eat healthy fats like eggs, coconut oil, butter, cheese, etc.
4883 2018-05-13 19:56:49 What is Que oil
4884 2018-05-13 19:56:47 These accounts need to be organized and on public record.

The BPS plans are currently to expand their snake oil, which will hurt thousands more.

As long as they can maintain "no harm recorded" they will not stop. They are not recording it on purpose. We have to do it ourselves.
4885 2018-05-13 19:56:46 Today. Sucks. I wanna drown myself in the fryer oil.
4886 2018-05-13 19:56:42 The internet tells me that 91.7% of ailments can be cured with apple cider vinegar or coconut oil.

4892 2018-05-13 19:55:45 The palmers coconut oil shampoo and conditioner. I got some in priceline when I was over and it's amazing. I can just about get it over here but it's tiny bottles and wayyyyy more expensive. It makes my poorly skin less sad. Thanks Arthur. You're so lovely 
4893 2018-05-13 19:55:41 I ate KFC today and I feel so sick. My body really can’t take a lot of oil. 
4894 2018-05-13 19:55:36 you can also use regular olive oil or castor oil, i just like the stuff that comes in a bottle with a little brush because it’s easier to apply
4895 2018-05-13 19:55:11 The markets will decide eventually if this strategy will be sustainable in the long run......let oil price take a slide.... you will know the truth

4897 2018-05-13 19:55:06 Have to disagree on the actual culprits here .Big oil and their cronies on the Hill were chiefly responsible  .Obama did not do enough and the brutal treatment of the People , using dogs , water guns and brutal "law enforcement " was on his watch .

4899 2018-05-13 19:54:59 In all honesty, there is two differences between what we see today from the Cavs v Celtics as opposed to the Raptors. Toronto rarely attacked the rim w/ confidence & Boston is. Second, the Cavs are missing open looks today. The latter is on Cleveland, not their opponent.
4900 2018-05-13 19:54:50 The smell of Castor Oil makes me sick . Like literally .
4901 2018-05-13 19:54:38 Well... they *did* do a limited edition white Minitaur. So maybe don't stop the fish oil pills just yet.
4902 2018-05-13 19:54:31 Saudi Arabia wants $100 oil, we want it too, we are a producer now... You can’t do that with the current supply... how can you raise prices? Cut the supply

4910 2018-05-13 19:52:57 I think govt. can control the retail price  of fuel by setting some limit (say 75 usd) after which no extra taxes will be paid to state and central govt . Their revenue will be protected up to 75 usd and only oil cost will be paid by people.less inflation, less impact on growth.
4911 2018-05-13 19:52:54 It might be castor oil plant

Also, solar totally useless in NZ and waste of time. We are already 85% renewable without it.  And how would you export solar???

4993 2018-05-13 19:38:34 it's smart on their behalf...suppress CDN oil while reaping benefits of U.S. industry...we're getting screwed and most Canadians don't get it.
4994 2018-05-13 19:38:27 Changed oil in the car. Should have done it in april.
4995 2018-05-13 19:38:18 Thanks for you tweet Tanya, we’d like to reassure you that we do use sustainable source palm oil in the few bars we have that contain it. We’ve worked with our suppliers for many years and ensure they are certified. We are looking at including this on our packaging soon.
4996 2018-05-13 19:37:57 Check these out!! Not 1 but 2 cool lime green 3-light fixtures! Lightweight thick plastic shades! Change up the bar with a spray paint! Imagine white, black or antique oil rubbed brinze! Oh the possibilities! 
$75 each — feeling excited
4997 2018-05-13 19:37:48 If they were oil rich we would hear about them daily , Something about oil that makes big news $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ I don't know what it could be ? $$$$$$$$$$$
4998 2018-05-13 19:36:59 Una pena que los de Oil hayan sido tan truchos. Espero que aprendan.
4999 2018-05-13 19:36:59 So why should people take Fish oil capsules instead of eating fresh fish
5000 2018-05-13 19:36:43 When the oil flows from your lips your voice will change!!! #justsomethingivealwaysnoticed #Godsanointedvessels
5001 2018-05-13 19:36:32 Megarich will stick with oil until last drop is pumped. US $ needed by most nations to buy oil,thank Nixon. Treasuries sales falling,interest rising - petro $ under attack. Iraq,Libya tried 2 skirt petro $. Iran,Syria off the US $. Follow the $ when looking at nations we attack.
5002 2018-05-13 19:36:27 this tweet inspired me to write poetry: 

ride his dick like a motorsport
reverse this pussy and then i squirt

drip drip oil slick dripping on his dick
made that fucker cum quick 

real talk when i left
my ass couldn’t walk
pussy so good made that boy stalk
5003 2018-05-13 19:35:50 And their reason was "because, oil."
5004 2018-05-13 19:35:48 We supported Europe Exxon suffered hundred billion dollars in revenue a year and then you cut deal with Russia for oil and its Iranians oil . Save it , Reagan made a mistake ,he shouldn't have bothered because you are under the communist regime.
5005 2018-05-13 19:35:39 (((they))) start wars to sell weapons and steal oil. Then send asylum seekers to white lands to genocide whites. Wake up
5006 2018-05-13 19:35:24 Damn, Sorry about that. I might've suggested a magnesium oil to help with the cramping but I'm not sure if it'd actually do anything in your case :/
5007 2018-05-13 19:35:18 Roberto acá en la provincia de San Juan ya hay estaciones de Oil que fueron compradas por Shell
5008 2018-05-13 19:35:11 Legit proud of myself for adding oil to my car with no male assistance.
5009 2018-05-13 19:34:42 Palestinian extremists have the support of dictators, autocrats, and despots of totalitarian and authoritarian oil rich regimes throughout the Middle East. If one side is at an automatic advantage, it is the side that is boosted by the demographics of the region.
5010 2018-05-13 19:34:36 This is when Dems start defending the oil industry
5011 2018-05-13 19:34:26 What about us here in the north.i agree with you on the fact that our Canadian gov. Give's company's like Irving oil millions for what .it's a slap in the face for us hard working peps that are having a rough go
5012 2018-05-13 19:34:18 “I put coconut oil in my hair and cocoa butter on my skin”
5013 2018-05-13 19:34:15 Just wait, it will happen, CO2 are about 1/2 of coals, decade ? Two ?
Renewables are not effective enough yet, oil as gasoline is here too, it must go first ?
5014 2018-05-13 19:34:05 Wooow I have to restock on more oil...

5017 2018-05-13 19:33:17 I don't understand how this is about me. We were talking about oil pipelines in North Dakota.

5021 2018-05-13 19:32:57 Former drama teacher and #WorstPMever Trudeau is ACTING as the defender of pipelines, but it looks more like he’s pursuing his UN Agenda 2030 goal of phasing out oil sands. 

He’ll throw a bone at KM, then lets see what happens. Hope I’m wrong and its not like the EE project.
5022 2018-05-13 19:32:41 I heard a mixture of palm oil and sugar helps with cough. My cousin once tried it and it worked.
5023 2018-05-13 19:32:16 You know Chinese outpacing us in solar energy jobs what are you gonna do about it? Never mind I already know what you're going to do as every Republican president has done kiss the ass of the oil company's and destroy the environment. You
5024 2018-05-13 19:32:10 Thats dangerous
5025 2018-05-13 19:32:07 I can see. It's one thing to be an expert vs. just marketing one's self. An PhD can call and market themselves as an expert. It's demonstratable. There's a category of influencers including myself that tell the story of their expertise. Then there are  oil salesmen.
5026 2018-05-13 19:31:45 I get full synthetic oil now. I’m a big boy
5027 2018-05-13 19:31:35 #Trump did the right decision when it came to the Iran Deal. #BillClinton is responsible for NK having nuclear capabilities. Do we want to go down the same road with Iran?  It’s all about the oil, right “W”
5028 2018-05-13 19:31:30 PS - the market went up because oil prices went up...that's not going to be good for average folks. It's still lost back it's 2017 gains.
5029 2018-05-13 19:31:25 so I’m eating a slice from homeslice in the tube, I tore some of it off and I have honestly just splatted truffle oil ALL down the man in a white shirt sat next to me, god help me pls get off soon

5045 2018-05-13 19:29:16 how much is he in to oil? dumping Iran deal causing oil to go up, up, up....  see if you need an arm and/or a leg to get gas next time.....
5046 2018-05-13 19:28:46 You gotta separate your products. So first, suave is horrible for your hair lol so I would scrap that. But it’s water based as well, your other products are oil based. Oil & water don’t mix, even for hair products  that causes more naps and build up.

5048 2018-05-13 19:28:21 I used mine Thursday as a oil rag when I changed my wife’s oil. @Charlie_Burris saw it.
5049 2018-05-13 19:28:21 Have a pizza once in a while bro, a nice thin crust Italian pizza with olive oil  Being an extreme hard ass 24/7 is no way to live
5050 2018-05-13 19:28:18 Coconut glycerin probably is just palm-based VG. The essential oil could be a risk if someone ignored directions and inhaled a lot of it.  Other than that, this looks like a stupid novelty product that will be widely ignored.

5058 2018-05-13 19:26:56 Coconut oil in school used to play with my feelings. One minute you thinking someone brought Niki chocolates for everyone and then all of a sudden you just see Anisha and her shiny hair of lies.
5059 2018-05-13 19:26:48 It just keeps on going. Posers and fraudsters and snake oil salespeople . Guess when you drain the swamp you put the dregs in charge.

5062 2018-05-13 19:25:54 It’s sad, it is all about oil and expansion for Israel . Can’t they just be happy with what they shouldn’t have? Funny timing to, didn’t the embassy just open?

5065 2018-05-13 19:25:07 I agree, however, we can not apply one truth from one dispensation to another. They are like oil and water, they don't mix well. We are under GRACE and Grace alone.

5069 2018-05-13 19:24:29 Omg. Could? Now sanctions won't permit our allies from doing business w/them even though some have poured investment dollars N2 Iran.
Who will pay for this? Americans, by higher gas prices. Who'll benefit? Russia, a trillion dollar+ 2 Putin/they'll put more of their oil on market

5078 2018-05-13 19:23:16 The only reason kurds are in bagdad is because america wants it so they have somebody on the inside in case iran takes over bagdad and its oil, i know iran has a big influence in iraq but america still controls everything from a distance.
5079 2018-05-13 19:23:07 That will have it's economic and political ramification for a country with a heavy reliance on crude oil revenue.
5080 2018-05-13 19:22:53 I know a pastry chef who made their fortune by going and working out on oil rigs for half the year. They're gagging for specialists like that tbh.
5081 2018-05-13 19:22:48 City are good but the only way is down after you peak.
And you'll never be Invincible, many have tried and failed.

Oil well

5082 2018-05-13 19:21:52 As the land is mined of oil they do continue to reclaim it. You can watch the process of reclaimation just south of Syncrudes main gate. Looks like a desert now but soon it will look like the bison reserve and wetlands that they reclaimed back in the 80's.
5083 2018-05-13 19:21:51 Is it ok if I come with bags of Semovita, rice and beans, Palm oil, Yam, Sugar, Salt, Groundnut Oil, cows, Aso Ofi and pay your Bride Price. Oya forward me Mama number and address. 
5084 2018-05-13 19:21:49 The same country following communists to ruin oil prices for the EU. From Chavez to Rich to Robbery. Ask for consideration but your actions have left you with strained relationships
5085 2018-05-13 19:21:49 So much for it being the “miracle oil” lol
5086 2018-05-13 19:21:45 Ptdrrrrrrr!!! Non mais je parle de vraiment irraisonnable! Ex: tu vois du pain qui coute 5000Naira et tu lui demande d'acheter, et c'est pas un Oil and Gas man! 
5087 2018-05-13 19:21:44 What else could she expect from a cooking oil ad. Why are they always portraying negative image of women in Pak.

5089 2018-05-13 19:21:29 Lavender or tea tree oil and certain supplements such as Dong Quai and Tribulus terrestris have also been associated with gynecomastia.
5090 2018-05-13 19:21:18 Admiring Pochs frankness - give me what I need to finish the job or I'm off. Don't believe it'll take oil scale money to do it but 2/3 big money signings and upgrade of wage structure. Levy will want successful season at new stadium #COYS
5091 2018-05-13 19:21:03 I thought your bike bottles were full of olive oil (it's also lighter than water) and breakfast consists of beacon and eggs.

Seriously though, I need to learn more about LCHF and apply it, I can't even shave before breakfast without bonking.
5092 2018-05-13 19:21:02 It's a world shift

Even Putin OK that
Plus oil goes up
5093 2018-05-13 19:20:51 Wow my room smells gorgeous. This grapefruit oil diffuser is doing wonders 
5094 2018-05-13 19:20:51 Great question! @RSPOtweets is a great resource for sustainable palm oil.
5095 2018-05-13 19:20:47 Actually syncrude and suncor started not only re-planting but fully reclaiming mined lands well before anyone even noticed the oil sands, let alone when they were legally obligated too. Same goes for workers rights and safety.
5096 2018-05-13 19:20:47 My skin eats the coconut oil. It doesn't break me out but I deff need to mix it

5100 2018-05-13 19:20:02 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.

5106 2018-05-13 19:19:14 Presumably they check every time they put petrol/diesel in their cars that the oil it was refined from was not pumped from an Iranian well? They wouldn't want to be supporting an evil regime with their petrodollars...

5110 2018-05-13 19:18:36 Gotta mix it with a little sweet almond oil on the face
5111 2018-05-13 19:18:14 To support those rich oil friends of W. Bush's? To stabilize so they can make their billions? Why? It was better off before.
5112 2018-05-13 19:18:12 Same, actually
5113 2018-05-13 19:18:05 I had worse, once; an old Jag that used 22 l/100km in town. A 90 litre tank lasted 400km. And I'd add 5 litres of oil each fill up too...
5114 2018-05-13 19:17:54 it's from a weight watchers recipe so given the era my guess is that you use vegetable oil instead of butter, and corn starch to thicken, so it's lower in saturated fat
5115 2018-05-13 19:17:49 I once put olive oil on my legs as a scrub this is not too far from reality
5116 2018-05-13 19:17:47 Agreed world is heating. Global oil demand is also forecast to rise from 94M bbl/day to 105 bbl/day by 2040. Stopping a BC pipeline won’t change that, and we are a tiny part of the global population/demand. So adaptation while keeping the #CDN economy strong is also crucial.

5121 2018-05-13 19:16:48 After the fall of the USSR, many US investers went to Russia for emerging markets biz opportunities, especially oil/gas. When Putin got control of all, he became their benefactor--or  destroyer, if they oppose him. Like all US corp. biz now in China, their loyalties are there.

5128 2018-05-13 19:15:48 The @NNPCGroup announces the appointment of Mallam Mele Kyari, incumbent GGM in charge of its Crude Oil Marketing Division, as Nigeria’s National Representative to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
5129 2018-05-13 19:15:46 One short tweet, three lies:
1. "keeping nothing for the future" - false, Alberta has plenty of resources.
2. you have no interest in keeping AB oil "for the future", but to keep it in the ground "forever".
3. the oil industry is not "sunsetting". That's just wishful thinking.
5130 2018-05-13 19:15:41 It does in Calif.
The oil companies pump it all west from Cushing Oklahoma.  Ever wonder how they pump 87, 89, 91, all at the same time.
It all has about 6% alcohol in it.
Ask a petroleum company for verification.  I did.
5131 2018-05-13 19:15:34 just put a varnish on a oil painting I'm selling only to look at the bottle right after applying it and seeing in big letters "DO NOT USE WITH OUT PAINTS"
5132 2018-05-13 19:15:20 In family life, love is the oil that eases friction, the cement that binds closer together, and the music that brings harmony. Friedrich Nietzsche
5133 2018-05-13 19:15:05 Umm... You and I could go back and forth on this, for sure. 

But when it comes to oil? 

Please. His hands are coated with blood.
5134 2018-05-13 19:14:56 The USA right now is drowning in expensive oil that is squeezing oil out of shale and sandstone sponges. A generation/s ago in Texas, offshore, Pennsylvania oil men were drilling into what are essentially underground oil caves (underground caves and lakes filled with oil).
5135 2018-05-13 19:14:52 And sanctions, don't forget sanctions destroy nations, oil rich or otherwise.
5136 2018-05-13 19:14:46 ON MY DISCOVER WEEKLY SPOTIFY PLAYLIST AND I was really good this little story i get castor oil for this song from a DUDE
5137 2018-05-13 19:14:28 Yeah needed changing. The corrosion on the base and threading also not a good sign that it was improperly tightened or other bad cause. Make sure you oil threads well on new one and gap.
5138 2018-05-13 19:14:23 you also need to consider d situation of d economy before he came into power,world policies concerning oil
5139 2018-05-13 19:14:05 Its wild a mans pride will prevent him from using black caster oil on his beard to fill it in

5142 2018-05-13 19:13:43 The full statement should have taken over a year. 

ETP did mini statements for multiple sections of the pipeline, and tried to claim those were enough. 

In short, the full EIS should be completed before pipe was laid. But our government allowed it. 

Now we have oil flowing.

5152 2018-05-13 19:12:37 If anyone asks for my opinion on the recent Alberta forest fires, #LacMégantic explosions and six Alberta oil spills,

I believe they were "attempted sabotage" by the same groups/entities who protested against the oil pipelines.

5154 2018-05-13 19:12:09 yes still use @Hamilton_Decor or purdy and clean the brush after use, although next week am using a fat hog pure bristle 3 inch, down from £30 to £10 for masonry, probably wont save brush after as its oil based masonry paint in black, hard to clean off #burystedmundshour

5157 2018-05-13 19:12:02 Don't let your skin marinate in makeup while you sleep, not to mention a day's worth of oil and bacteria buildup. Cleanse your face nightly. #rr1
5158 2018-05-13 19:11:57 This is ridiculous.  We only gave them back their own money, it is done and over, they were NOT getting any money.  How can he be so ignorant of what is common knowledge !!!!  All this will accomplish is to endanger the world AND raise the price of gas and oil.
5159 2018-05-13 19:11:49 I think you will find if you don't just copy self righteous Independence figures and do your own investigation, that Emirates are the 8th producer of oil in 2016 and the UK is 20th. Norway for the record 15th.
5160 2018-05-13 19:11:36 Let's face facts, agric exports in its raw state can't suffice&wholly replace crude oil as source of revenue, what's the essence of having huge external reserve but the standard of living in Nigeria doesn't measure up to those of Ethiopia and Kenya? We need results not statistics
5161 2018-05-13 19:11:01 This sesame oil got me smelling like a meal and a half but at least my skin feels fall off the bone tender.
5162 2018-05-13 19:10:46 Olive oil has a low heat point, degrading the health benefits of the oils. Coconut, avocado and peanut oil are better but we still suggest low-heat cooking.
5163 2018-05-13 19:10:28 Work closes at 4pm. Nine cars just pulled up. Only three are oil changes.
5164 2018-05-13 19:10:18 “The secret of happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never forget the drops of oil on the spoon.”
5165 2018-05-13 19:10:16 If you don't know this to be truth I'd love to hear your explanation. I know there are other economic deals but the high value ones include oil and nuclear industry.  @Siemens_Energy you sold your soul to the devil for American souls.

5169 2018-05-13 19:09:46 The EU gets a grand total of 13% of their oil from Iran.

And they're doing a hell of a lot better job than the U.S. - especially now that Trump's in charge - of reducing oil usage.

5173 2018-05-13 19:08:31 Have you tried it? No oil or fat, just brown the butter side to crispy, in the bacon flavour left in the pan. Never use any fat to fry your bacon either. Yeah, streaky, obv.
5174 2018-05-13 19:08:27 Ran through about close to 300 eggs with today's Mother's Day rush, have oil burns all over my hands, all my prep bowls are empty. Whata day
5175 2018-05-13 19:08:19 He totally made his mark promising the stars while peddling snake oil..... from minorities to the poor to the jobs lost when he diverted tons of #NASA funds.  The right and left up top the last twenty, twenty five years both promise a lot, deliver very little to #everyman.
5176 2018-05-13 19:08:13 I blame the organisms that turned into oil and gas. If they hadn't done that millions of years ago, we wouldn't have problems right now.
5177 2018-05-13 19:07:55 Boston for us and next million, with oil prices?
5178 2018-05-13 19:07:50 yes - I agree but isn‘t the expression „vegetable oil very missleading?

5182 2018-05-13 19:07:38 Yesterday I took a look under my new car, spotless. No oil. Today I come outside to it, and the rear main seal is pissing oil. The dealership cleaned it before selling it to me. Looks like I'm out a couple grand. Fuck Ideal Motorcars of Ohio

5186 2018-05-13 19:07:05 "Put a little oil in, then add them in too."
5187 2018-05-13 19:06:58 Isnt Genie Energie located the Nederlands? GE is connected with Genie Oil and Gas Inc in Delaware. GE’s activities are described as finance related. Why would Bolton and others invest in a company in the Netherlands?
5188 2018-05-13 19:06:56 Discounting North Sea oil, there is the issue of #Trident. There are only 2 other locations in the UK that relocation can occur.
5189 2018-05-13 19:06:51 @netanyahu please remind TRUMP USA can extract oil from coal 41% more world oil reserves and we build one plant gives more oil than IRAN has . USA has more coal anywhere in the world lets build this in expensive plant. Kentucky is ready to give free land to build this plant.
5190 2018-05-13 19:06:50 Dems need to hammer away at the Trump Cohen dealings, the lies that he has been busted on, rising oil prices, the treatment of women, Black People, Hispanic people, the LGBQT community, the attacks on John McCain, and the complete ignoring of James Shaw Jr. from Trump & the GOP.
5191 2018-05-13 19:06:39 Handcuffing an unarmed 5th grader?
5192 2018-05-13 19:06:32 The point I was making about the coal is the reason they are in the middle east is their oil. They have very little other business there. If the US doesn't move forward, the same type of filth hitting it from Chinese pollution will be coming from US & hitting W Europe.
5193 2018-05-13 19:06:22 Go grab beard oil. Should help you out
5194 2018-05-13 19:06:13 @annap300 I heard your family's coming over---OLIVE OIL PLEASE 
5195 2018-05-13 19:06:04 You sound insane....you are all over the map. Oil prices rising thanks to you. Europe walking away from us. ZTE works with gov. of China we would be better not having them in U.S.
5196 2018-05-13 19:05:31 It's a disgrace. American word will never be good ever again. Iran and everyone lived up to the deal. US double crossed everyone and has the nerve to sanction others? It's crazy and is ruinous to country's reputation.
Doing Russian bidding. Destroy alliances, drive up oil price.
5197 2018-05-13 19:05:26 I want one of those oil changes for $3.66

5202 2018-05-13 19:03:38 This is all I'm saying too, blaming the recession on Buhari is absolutely unfair as the indices to recession are there before his presidency, FG borrowing to pay salaries, low oil prices, depleted reserve, no savings and infrastructure. There is little a new govt could have done.
5203 2018-05-13 19:03:29 Does your car have an oil change light that was reset? Wondering if just unhooking your battery will fix the situation?

5208 2018-05-13 19:02:29 My room smell like Milds & coconut oil wtf 
5209 2018-05-13 19:02:27 It's called a dishwasher. And if you can't survive without oil produced plastic, your life isn't worth the lives of the thousands of animals that would die as a result of you continuing to live. Again, you aren't that special.

5214 2018-05-13 19:01:49 Wrong, the issue is Nigeria has refused to develop, we don't hold the govt accountable and we celebrate mediocrity. During the 70s UAE and the Qatar were below Nigeria, deserts, nothing to boast of aside the oil...today their country is what real development looks like...
5215 2018-05-13 19:01:44 When I heard big boy I saw the goal post shift from just graduating school and getting a job in an oil company to owning that company..Part of me almost felt defeated, like wait I have to own a Bentley?..Your opinion mattered that much, guess I learnt to digest  art better lol

5231 2018-05-13 18:57:36 Didn’t go so wrong, we just need to do everything perfectly with the rate of Citeh oil money.
5232 2018-05-13 18:57:34 There is so much you can do with a thermal imager. Look for lost people, gauge drums that may be leaking, spot dragging or inoperative brakes on trucks, etc. You can even find oil on water at night. Learn to read cold spots as well as hot.
5233 2018-05-13 18:57:27 I feel your pain I really do it’s clear which direction Chelsea are going, back to where they belong pre the Russian oil money
5234 2018-05-13 18:57:27 I started using coconut oil yesterday, but only because I can’t find tallow or ‘beef drippings’ as they call it here. The one buchery that normally has, has been out of stock for about 2 weeks.
5235 2018-05-13 18:56:50 What’s cannabis oil industry 
5236 2018-05-13 18:56:43 It doesn't work as in omg there's nothing there but honest that burn on my arm used to be so much worse and using Bio Oil did help.

5240 2018-05-13 18:55:44 @AmbJohnBolton bullies European countries into Iran shaming.  Iran is still untrusting of US policies.  Remember when the US overthrew a democraticly elected President of Iran and embedded an oil industry & US friendly puppet back in the 1950s?  Iran remembers.
5241 2018-05-13 18:55:34 It couldnt have been managed because our monoeconomy proceed dropped greatly due to low oil price, our ECA account and reserve was almost at nothing. It was an economy that needed a restart by making other aspect of the economy viable which is happening now in tax and agriculture
5242 2018-05-13 18:55:23 We don't buy Iranian oil.

Besides, we are a net exporter of oil. 

We are also the largest refiner. 

Gas prices go up when the economy booms. Millions depend on the oil/gas industry for high paying jobs.

Even at $5/gallon, it's a deal compared to the billions in costs for E&P.

5244 2018-05-13 18:55:09 You mean America didn't suffer recession under Obama???  All economies undergo business cycles and in our case we emptied the external reserves and excess crude account long before Buhari was in the picture. Add to that low oil prices and missing funds from the NNPC...  smh
5245 2018-05-13 18:55:07 #business (Lays) Dry instead of fry. Classic chips, sprayed with starch & oil as chips are air dried.

5247 2018-05-13 18:54:53 According to a survey, in the top three most adulterated foods, #MILK comes at second position just below olive oil and the third one is honey.

5248 2018-05-13 18:54:45 So yesterday my motorcycle started leaking oil the day I went to sell it. Today I cleaned the oil off and blew the dirt off as well to look for a leak... It's not leaking anymore. Must be performance anxiety or something
5249 2018-05-13 18:54:44 Where do you think they get their oil, cow pies?
5250 2018-05-13 18:54:44 Watched there will be blood and honestly?  Not a lot of blood.  Should have called it there will be oil and yelling,

5259 2018-05-13 18:53:27 Is this the spill where a careless backhoe operator punctured a pipeline? Where no wildlife were hurt? Where the oil barely made it to Burrard Inlet?
5260 2018-05-13 18:53:05 @Tampax can you please make an organic tampon infused with cbd oil?I think about this every. Single. Month.

5262 2018-05-13 18:52:55 The right  answer: a ban on importing oil from Iran, they will have to sell for ten  cents a dollar, the world will not be affected by the suspension of  dealing in Iranian oil, there are alternatives
5263 2018-05-13 18:52:54 in reality the MAIN reason the troops are there is because of oil. not cause of freedom and that’s something a lot of people don’t know. some people do have that mindset of joining the military cause of freedom and i respect that. but the bigger picture is cause of oil and i dont
5264 2018-05-13 18:52:50 This is true..at least I didn't put screenwash where the oil should go!
5265 2018-05-13 18:52:38 My student missed class because their car needed an oil change and their shower only had cold water
5266 2018-05-13 18:52:15 Only i could put coconut cooking oil on my skin thinking it was sun cream
5267 2018-05-13 18:52:08 And now Bolton and Trump can get the war they’ve been dreaming for. And “take the oil”. I’m sure everything will be just fine
5268 2018-05-13 18:52:01 They will tell you of oil prices and Gej but not mention how he left Nigeria on auto pilot for 5+ months only to come up with a mediocre cabinet.

5276 2018-05-13 18:50:34 In what world is Russia "pissed?" They stand to benefit more than anyone with the US out. They already have massive deals with Iran over power plants and Putin is meeting with Israel re:Syria soon. Plus RT reported this would help Russian oil.
They are definitely not pissed.
5277 2018-05-13 18:50:28 Lmao you can read all about the stones online and in the comics. They don't create matter. Altering reality to swap water to oil doesnt change the the fact that water is still finite. Lmao. U dont get it.
5278 2018-05-13 18:50:22 Totally agree.. carbs are a problem and excessive oil just a bad idea
5279 2018-05-13 18:50:20 @realDonaldTrump Great job with the tax cuts!  Even better job when we spend our money at the gas pumps sending the money to your rich oil pals.  You big mouth blow hole.

5281 2018-05-13 18:49:50 Yes y’all can call me Homophobic or whatever, but what you can’t tell me is that a man having a sexual relationship with another man is okay and should be accepted. Same goes for the women. 

As for those of you that switch gender like it’s engine oil, enjoy!
5282 2018-05-13 18:49:49 Unless the Arab country gives their oil to the US at a much lower price than everywhere else or perhaps agrees to buy the vast majority of their military equipment from the US! (Saudi Arabia)

5292 2018-05-13 18:47:59 That's irrelevant! The fact remains that if there was no American interests(oil or strategic) in Venezuela,they'd have zero interest in the country!
5293 2018-05-13 18:47:44 @realDonaldTrump thanks for raising the oil prices you must be in the pocket of Saudi and Russian you are hurting the middle class.
5294 2018-05-13 18:47:16 We need to begin exporting more oil. Take away countries dependence of energy by exporting more, and it takes away their power. Along with Russia (Economy is in shambles) only domestic products are; oil, weapons, lumber, and labor. We have massive reserves here in the great USA
5295 2018-05-13 18:47:13 BCH isn't a snake oil salesman.  We are not telling people they get 100 "cash" only to get 15 cents.  

I think Bitcoin should be about honesty, clarity, and teaching knowledge.  Why would i trust someone with *my money* converted to BCH, if they can't even talk to me honestly?
5296 2018-05-13 18:46:49 We don't want occupation cooking oil!
5297 2018-05-13 18:46:44 Excuse me if I take that with a grain of salt.  A few years ago the studies said fish oli supplements were beneficial.  Before that anti-oxidants were all the rage.  Until later studies said, "oops. Never mind".  I'll keep eating a balanced diet and continue to take my fish oil.
5298 2018-05-13 18:46:42 Of course you can, but that wasn't the argument you were making. You were making the argument that there wouldn't be sufficient detail in the WA and the declaration for a Ref on it, and calling the idea of one "snake oil" as a result. I was pointing out that this is not true.
5299 2018-05-13 18:46:23 Peace on the Korean Peninsula is a step towards legit world peace. With all the greatest minds from the US to Russia to China to even North Korea, we can make this world a better place and be self sufficient from oil and other harmful products on this planet.

5339 2018-05-13 18:39:35 Yesterday I put away dishes, cleaned stove top & kitchen counters & did laundry, got oil changed & took some garbage out of car. Gran Gene called me "so domestic" lol. I really need to do sooo much more though
5340 2018-05-13 18:39:14 I am 5 ways from Sunday lazy today for no reason, sure its 90 degree's outside but thats not affecting me in any way to be lazy.

Sure I got things to do, oil to pour, engines to check, grass to cut, scrap metal to cut, but I just wanna be lazy low energy.
5341 2018-05-13 18:38:52 That's true why are funneling money into any big buisness. Libreals complain about money going to oil but not a peep about any other big industry almost like there hypocrites
5342 2018-05-13 18:38:40 Ok forget putin & assad, what happens if they r out of the equation.?Will the us continue to back rebels steal oil & kill civilians? Yes they will but 1000 times worse. Yr argument is nonsense since there’s only 2 options at this point failure or victory.Syrians choose Assad

5344 2018-05-13 18:38:33 My favorite pizza parlor, when I was a kid, had what looked like a huge oil paining of Don Corleone holding a slice, with the legend “I’m gonna make you a pizza you can’t refuse.” While this is a clear step down, I gotta respect the tradition.
5345 2018-05-13 18:38:21 Why does my @Starbucks vente iced black tea taste like the barista added fish oil to it? Is this a new thing? My joints are achy but I'd rather just use a topical ointment.
5346 2018-05-13 18:38:13 Risk management mustn't be our advisor wether we preserve or destroy the planet. We made it to the moon in no time now what prevents us to go sustainable? Oil, gas and coal won't last forever anyway. There are millions of uses for fossils other than burning them.

5348 2018-05-13 18:37:45 The Iraq War was a monumental mistake by two idiots called Bush and Blair...our young lads died for what reason? Oil? A few arms sales? Toppling a bully?.. I’m no leftist but most sensible people now realize it was a senseless war built on a lie with terrible consequences
5349 2018-05-13 18:37:42 Normally I wouldn’t but this would be a demonstration of how well his wishful thinking actually works. People who latch on to placebo motivational jargon have never really felt what those snake oil salesmen pretend to cure
5350 2018-05-13 18:37:14 The way that oil just popped in my face I’m never frying chicken again 
5351 2018-05-13 18:37:05 why you black people call cooking oil,  fish oil marha??????

5355 2018-05-13 18:36:07 But would stating facts be polarising? For example, the Arab nations sell a lot of oil, the Commonwealth games were held in Glasgow, the universe is expanding, and the Partition was mainly because of communal tensions and paranoia?
5356 2018-05-13 18:35:30 Tell Morata to reduce the oil on his hair
5357 2018-05-13 18:35:26 These ppl still retain security clearances. Why? 
With what we know about Deep State actors, might be time to reconsider?
5358 2018-05-13 18:35:23 Then after the price of oil rebounded, these same commentators expressed their frustration that Russians were insufficiently impoverished by the GFC to rise up & overthrow Putin & all his works & welcome a West-oriented ‘Reformer’

5362 2018-05-13 18:35:03 Never said it’s a small amount, but the amount we do use from them is a fraction. To say the president bombing oil fields or pulling out of the Iran deal, from an area we get a fraction of our oil is the reason why oil prices have went up does not make sense. Enlightenmeotherwise

5370 2018-05-13 18:34:01 Notley doesn't want oil,Trudeau doesn't want oil,Horgan doesn't want oil. So if all the major players involved do not want oil development. What are the chances of any increased oil production in Canada? Zero,Zilch,Notta. Until Conservatives regain power across Canada.
5371 2018-05-13 18:33:52 Nah you like to smell burnt hair and oil sheen

5375 2018-05-13 18:33:40 Lol ok then show me the studies that show that high concentrated CBD oil and a diet change can “get rid” of stage 4 cancer. Also a keto diet is a no for someone who has cancer since it can cause your blood pH to drop resulting in a acidic environment that cancer thrives in

5393 2018-05-13 18:30:41 F off bully boy go sit on your little comic soap box next to #olive oil thinking you are a big cheese !!! When you are insignificant reduced to sitting on a comic programme bullying dignified ppl like I've said pick on #j clarkson  , Conor mcgregor.

5400 2018-05-13 18:29:27 My friend, I dreamed the most fearless dream! I stood in the Tigris, with the courageous, courageous vats of oil all around, taking me in the name of the Anunnaki. How can I make an offering to Inanna in this courageous place?

Why is this not for all Americans ? our future our kids should not be responsible for this debt Pay off the Debt !

5420 2018-05-13 18:25:36 But countries do not abandon resources. The money is to valuable to Canada's economy, just like coal, lumber and power. USA in now wanting to tax the oil again to keep our price down. We are controlled by the USA. This effects all mining, logging, food deliveries.
5421 2018-05-13 18:25:35 Without the s300 Syria will never be able to make a push to retake golan heights, with them the stand a good chance to reclaim their soil and with it the oil & gas reserves. This is what ISrael fears the most losing golan heights & not being able to bomb where and when then pls.
5422 2018-05-13 18:25:11 The further in time the sell, the lower the lock price. Selling more than 12 months will probably result in locked prices of sub $50/bbl. Hedging on oil price can be very risky.
5423 2018-05-13 18:25:08 We have no reason to have a hot war with them so yes.  It's not like Iran with trillions in oil and minerals rights to exploit.
5424 2018-05-13 18:25:04 Nothing like Middle East oil to make a war very sellable to all the wrong people and everyone who objects becomes obstructionist loons who just don't understand the "moral imperative" of "liberating" oppressed countries.

5441 2018-05-13 18:21:59 to be fair to the finnish people my region also sticks the gross motherufuckers in everything, we even have a dialect phrase that means "a quick easy meal" and it's literally "two bell peppers dipped in oil"

5446 2018-05-13 18:21:31 Perhaps tax dollars should not bail out failed banks, subsidize oil conglomerates, fuel apartheid regimes, support juntas, fill prisons with marginalized groups...
USA! USA!
5447 2018-05-13 18:21:24 just put on perfume before work and wondered why i bother.
yesterday i ended up smelling like pickled banana peppers. last week it was tea tree oil.
maybe i should just accept that my scent now is "clean-up in aisle 5."
5448 2018-05-13 18:21:21 My dad just came in and took my car to get an oil change and put two new tires on it

5453 2018-05-13 18:20:39 Seems as though you searched green energy but did you research the NAFTA deal re Oil & Gas guarentees? Green energy only currently accounts for approx 13% of onbgrid production. Mostly due to Redtape re off grid supply management.
5454 2018-05-13 18:20:08 Biological weapons program? Define no longer at risk? Cross my heart and hope to die? Oh it’s the Trust me deal. Lol. Bottom line is NK has nothing the US wants.They want Iran’s oil.Trump has said as much in the past and looking for any reason to invade a country.Sound familiar?
5455 2018-05-13 18:20:05 Gas price at the pump is determined by the oil companies, not politicians.

5458 2018-05-13 18:19:56 And so, the search for a suitable substitute for (traditional) oil paints may have come to an end. WATER MIXABLE OIL PAINTS!! Why did I not think of those before? The same as normal oils,  but no need for chest annoying white spirit!

Back end of the month Bro, need the break..
5462 2018-05-13 18:18:39 Got my mom a wooden box full of five different incenses, a couple new oils for her oil burner and a windchime for Mother’s Day.
5463 2018-05-13 18:18:06 All these years I was taught to pop popcorn with oil or it wouldn’t pop. Little did I know til recently if you just use high heat IT. WILL. POP. Save my heart.
5464 2018-05-13 18:18:02 Oil changes are just one long shame-fest 
5465 2018-05-13 18:17:52 @TimCoronel 

I’ve done RE listings and sales. 
I learned engine building at Consolidated Freightways in Portland OR. When we still owned Freightliner Truck the truck we built and developed. We also did R&D for General Motors Detroit Diesel. And helped Chevron Oil w/multi grades.

5467 2018-05-13 18:17:44 I smell of Honeysuckle, because it quietens the bad Voices a bit, but the scent is so strong  I feel faint and dizzy. Should probably take that PRN anticrazy or something, instead of oil mixing... Or just lie down!
5468 2018-05-13 18:17:39 Fish oil pills leave the worst taste in your mouth 
5469 2018-05-13 18:17:25 All of them have variations of the same problem. Dilma fell to corruption in Brazil, Najib fell to corruption in Malaysia. The difference is in the degree (we were already corrupt even with no oil), so adding petrol to that problem was just irresponsible.
5470 2018-05-13 18:17:11 Mom's get 30% OFF All SELECT Oil products for Mothers Day! Not a MOM? Come anyways and you'll get 20% SELECT catridges! Great Selection!!!
5471 2018-05-13 18:17:11 More proof Trump is more interested in China and Russia's economies than the US. 

Rebuilding China's telecom industry doesn't help US workers. 

Implementing policies that encourage higher energy prices (even though their is an oil glut in the US) helps Russia  not US families

5478 2018-05-13 18:16:09 Had about 5mm of oil in each well. I think they stuck when I poured in the batter and it parted the oil.
5479 2018-05-13 18:16:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, and open borders.
5480 2018-05-13 18:16:01 Love the fact that mind blowing electronic artists still have to huddle around an oil heated portable radiator while creating!
5481 2018-05-13 18:15:44 So glad my daddy taught me how to take care of myself! I can change oil, change tires, and check other things in my cars even though, I take them to get serviced! If something comes up though, I can handle it!!
5482 2018-05-13 18:15:38 someone spilled fish oil in the warehouse and just know I’m having a terrible time
5483 2018-05-13 18:15:21 Check your Transmission oil today.
5484 2018-05-13 18:15:12 Absolutely!!
5485 2018-05-13 18:15:04 How is a healthy alternative. If it's sweet with fruit, that's still sugar and houmos is full of oil?
5486 2018-05-13 18:15:04 Once the Middle East stops doing oil transactions with U.S. currency, the dollar value will drop significantly. And since U.S. currency is not backed by gold, it's Fiat money, therefore making it a "good faith" currency because you have faith it has value
5487 2018-05-13 18:14:53 Water, essential oil, leave in conditioner, hands and wide tooth comb and seal with a butter.
5488 2018-05-13 18:14:42 Trump cares more about Chinese job that US jobs!!!  He is no friend of the American worker. Gas prices are soring. Heading for $4.00 gallon so the Saudi’s stay rich and his oil company golf buddies.  Ther goes all of his tax cut!
5489 2018-05-13 18:14:40 I thought Teatree oil for my face. I know it’s supposed to be good for you but it smells horrific. 
5490 2018-05-13 18:14:37 While you were distracted by Trump's tweets, Joe Arpaio allowed oil drilling in a cute parrot.
5491 2018-05-13 18:14:23 I have made that case as well, and I have shown that the source is largely soybean oil. See my medium post I just tweeted.

This doesn't mean the dietary guidelines caused this increase. What direction would processed food have taken without the dietary guidelines?

5501 2018-05-13 18:12:25 Bit warm for the usual Sunday roast chicken so I've covered the skin with a harissa paste & garlic oil mix, and shoved a lemon up its jaxi.

£'s mean much more to the lot of them than any principles or politics.
pity more people don't boycott companies who act against us, whether it's palm oil, toxins or like this.
5503 2018-05-13 18:12:08 They're reproducing the Japan oil shortage.
I also have the biggest stockpile before the event.
5504 2018-05-13 18:12:03 Both. Fortunately I didn't put screenwash where the oil should go, or I really would have been in trouble!
5505 2018-05-13 18:12:00 Pick a pathway. Our unfit, malignant, criminal in the White House has diminished US leadership, increased the risks of destabilized oil regions, forgotten all the kids maimed in Iraq to give the Shia population democracy. We can lift up all Africa & Asia.

5511 2018-05-13 18:10:42 Then stop it, you know it will be an almighty mess and we need stronger ties with the EU as the USA cannot be trusted, oil prices are threatened in Iran and China is getting more powerful.
5512 2018-05-13 18:10:38 NOTHING BEATS A CHEAP MEAL LIKE RICE, SOY SAUCE, AND SESAME OIL.

5524 2018-05-13 18:08:30 We're you intending topping up the car with oil or the screen wash with "skoosh"
5525 2018-05-13 18:08:28 "The world will nvr know how sad I'm

5528 2018-05-13 18:08:03 The new Gov’t has pledged not to borrow & reduce taxes which should strengthen demand. Even if there is initial currency and mkt volatility from uncertainty, it will recover as Gov’t policies on reduced spending and infra savings filter thru. Oil price is a plus in the short run.

5530 2018-05-13 18:07:39 All these people out there selling pills for you brain, penis, energy, weight loss, oil for your coffee, etc. It’s telling you something. Products focused on those very often desperate for a solution are easy marks. What does it say about integrity?

5533 2018-05-13 18:07:00 Are you aware production is at record high levels? And we have more pipelines than ever.

The industry is creating it's own problem. 

And who is "we"? I don't own an oil company. Your quoting potential profits for private industry not royalties or taxes for Canadians
5534 2018-05-13 18:06:40 Actually, more to the point, Trump did Putin's work for him. The alliance is split with America on the outside looking in. And with the price of oil now moving higher, Putin's Russia oil economy gets much needed revenue.
5535 2018-05-13 18:06:24 I can't remember my friend from wisconsin who is interested in CBD oil?

5545 2018-05-13 18:03:55 Most foods with a cap have an approximate measurement in the cap. Salad oil? One tablespoon. Milk with plastic caps? One teaspoon. And so on.

5566 2018-05-13 18:00:48 No doubt, the policy on trans fats was a big mistake.

But it's not clear DGA actually caused the increase in seed oil consumption.

It's even less clear that polyunsaturated oils are worse than lard. Quite the opposite maybe.

5573 2018-05-13 17:59:57 You won't be laughing as constantly climbing oil prices lead to constantly rising gas prices.

5577 2018-05-13 17:58:59 Yes, the necessity has always been there, however never has an administration been so incapable of admonishing the big oil corps, powerful gun lobbyists, and those preying on minorities. Anti-pipeline, anti-racism, Occupy Wall Street, pro gun-legislation, etc. are not new issues.

5613 2018-05-13 17:53:42 I haven’t invented it yet. :) but itll involve blanching ramp greens and making a ramp oil, then folding it into the dough. Then making a trad carbonara set but with a poached duck egg on top probably.

5632 2018-05-13 17:50:24 This slick evangelical snake oil salesman, whose idea of leading by example is heaping praise on an illegitimate president who will likely go to VP "Penance'" biblical version of hell, is such a bastardization of spirituality that it makes me want to puke up a hairball.

5649 2018-05-13 17:48:07 My two cents:
Putin sells oil to Kim, tells Kim to cozy up with Trump in turn for some favors. Putin tells Trump to mess w/ Iran.
A master plan to destabilize Europe+make Trump look good before midterm elections.
You can also add that oil prices will rise, Putin back in business.

5651 2018-05-13 17:47:36 There isn’t strong evidence yet of election rigging by the Russians. Not anymore collusion with Russia than the Saudi oil Sheikhs or domestic corporations. The government has been hiding things from us since the country started, governments like power and control.

5669 2018-05-13 17:44:43 one step further, the constraint on demand is really $/kWh. battery cost inferred from semi spec is <$100/kWh. When it is achieved that will be the end chapter of oil age and demand won't be a problem.

5706 2018-05-13 17:39:35 Yup. A key is the petrodollar system. After the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, Saudi & US made deal that oil denominated only in US $. 

Saddam, Ghadafi deposed for challenging that. 

US not interested in fighting terror, only in defending dollar as reserve currency.

5737 2018-05-13 17:35:20 The government gains net revenue from oil & gas. Stop extracting and the government will have less money to spend on other stuff, not more.

5741 2018-05-13 17:34:36 #OOTT | Sometimes lofty oil prices take care of themselves, by reducing demand. If not, Saudi Arabia and Russia are likely to pump more supply to force prices lower. They don’t want producers like the U.S., Canada, and Brazil to take more market share. @Citi #WTI #Brent $CL_F

5824 2018-05-13 17:21:35 True. If this were free market at work, the #KM project would be dead. The problem is gov’t in corporate pocket willing to manipulate the environmental review process and hand out our tax dollars as subsidies to Texas oil company while walking all over FN rights.
5825 2018-05-13 17:21:32 So does the GOP both parties do it, i.e pro life stance, earmarks for farmers, oil companies, what’s the difference both are constituents? So ur saying the opioid push not is worthless ?
5826 2018-05-13 17:21:23 Boy, it's like the rest of the world has to try to inflate their ability to defend themselves against the American terrorists that invade their country for oil. Who could have seen that coming? #youareafuckingfool

5852 2018-05-13 17:18:01 I can see why Mikey is disappointed. Only about 5 barrels of oil released. A local homeowner was inconvenienced. On the other hand, a rail tanker accident would have been much more satisfying -- thousands of barrels, maybe a fire and explosion? That's what Mikey prefers.
5853 2018-05-13 17:17:54 How many days would it take for him to admit that his oil venture, Genie Energy, in Golan Heights is the reason there is no peace in the ME?

5870 2018-05-13 17:15:52 @FareedZakaria I believe Trump dumped the Iran deal to help Russia. It is a way of increasing oil prices which intern helps Russia. Why isn't anyone talking about this?
5871 2018-05-13 17:15:42 Have you checked your oil level
5872 2018-05-13 17:15:31 It's easy folks: Putin told Trump to kill #JCPOA to get higher oil prices Russia & Iran desperately need plus Putin gets Trump to sanction Europe: Total perfection. Trump is a Russian agent. #GOP trying to help Russia are traitors. We will be damaged, but they will die in prison.

5883 2018-05-13 17:12:40 I agree, lots of people in eastern Canada are not anti oil, they are anti Alberta. Of course that doesn’t stop them for being first in line with their hands out to share the revenue generated by our natural resources.

5912 2018-05-13 17:09:13 I think they are all going down regardless. This is Iran panicking as well. They see the cash flow is going to stop. It's a big part of what has propped up what little economy they have. Ofc they have oil resources, but that matters less when you can't afford to get it out.
5913 2018-05-13 17:08:49 In the past week I’ve dropped a master lock on my barefoot toe, sliced my arm on a door frame, got my finger pinched/stuck in my car’s gear shift, burned myself with oil from a hot pan and hit my head. I get it universe, you fucking hate me.

5933 2018-05-13 17:06:13 @DiamondandSilk I need your help . plant needs built oil extraction from coal is 41% more reserves than IRAN has . 500 000 new jobs at 40 $ an hour , no college ED. needed our country has more coal than any other please call congress and TRUMP . first yr. open will create 720BIL.
5934 2018-05-13 17:06:12 I think that’s the plan, the oil prices have gone up too.
5935 2018-05-13 17:05:51 Dits...the people of Iran are not oppressed.  They have vast oil reserves 
5936 2018-05-13 17:05:34 What planet do you live on? OIL?! They ship coal to China right now. If they had oil they would be in the global market already!

5940 2018-05-13 17:05:16 of course, this really doesn't help because we put oil into price indexes and Congress raises SS cola and deficit.
5941 2018-05-13 17:05:13 This week I surprised a Googler who had a memento mori tshirt on. Yup. I took Northern Renaissance Art and have painted in oil, acrylics, sculpted, welded, know Solidworks, autocad, etc. I even wanted to learn glass glowing once :D Makes you a better person!

5946 2018-05-13 17:04:25 How can we be an oil producing country but we refine them outside our country..can't you see how stupid those leading us are
5947 2018-05-13 17:04:07 Why is it in Russia's best interests that:

1. The US economy is roaring
2. US domestic energy production is spiking (Russia's most important export is oil/natural gas)
3. US military receiving increased funding

?

The 'Trump is Putin's agent' argument makes no sense.

5950 2018-05-13 17:03:57 Two points (1) it isn't the same deal at all because North Korea does not export oil into the world market like Iran does; and (2) supporting the North Korean economy keeps them from reunifying with the South which neither Japan nor China would enjoy.

5954 2018-05-13 17:03:24 Frankly, my eyes glaze over with games like NGDP stuff. My approach to economics is principle based. You have to look at situation substantively, not as labeled. KSA rasing oil prices through OPEC is a tax hike, not a price increase. 1/2

5961 2018-05-13 17:02:27 Is it time that Libyans (not the puppets) sit down with #France and ask why is it they want to impose a murderous military dictator on the people of #Libya, and why France opposes a real democracy for a sovereign Libya? Is it to do with oil?
5962 2018-05-13 17:02:19 I think you are correct.  She is a treasonous puppet of Canada’s foreign-funded enemies whose goal is to land-lock Canadian oil.

Not easy getting ripe tomatoes here in Scotland.

Top quality extra virgin olive oil will no doubt add flavour.

Some olives with pimenton would add another taste & texture dimension

6065 2018-05-13 16:47:50 It was completely hypocritical of us to overthrow their legitimate elected government just to keep their oil and then install the despotic shah to keep the oil flowing.
6066 2018-05-13 16:47:26 Hey man, do you need a roommate? If this "FuckStick" goes more than four years I'm outa here and moving over there! Too damn hot here anyway. I'm a package deal...I cook, clean, do yard work, basic carpentry, & can change the oil in your auto. Also, a darn good bicycle mechanic!
6067 2018-05-13 16:47:15 "Arab money", "Oil money" says the fans of the club that spent 250mil+ on just five players. Nobody's fauly that your signings didn't thrive like theirs.
6068 2018-05-13 16:47:10 This $20 facial oil really got me together...

6075 2018-05-13 16:46:19 The Formula: (Growth is the hobgoblin of Capitalism)+(Energy=Growth) + (Crude=Energy) + (EROI for Crude is 10% of it's origins) = ( Margins are narrow, and to maintain control it's about who profits from the oil that matters most)
6076 2018-05-13 16:46:04 same tho

6082 2018-05-13 16:44:46 The govt whether provincial or federal has no control of our prices for oil in Canada
6083 2018-05-13 16:44:38 In 2015, I recall news of Rockerfeller funds getting out of oil for “ethical” reasons or whatever. Might be related. Also suggest BIG OIL and the elite money therein behind possible suppression for free zero-pt type energy tech.
6084 2018-05-13 16:44:37 Even in the US when electric cars becoming popular in 1970s, it got shut down by the oil giants because it will hurt their buisness.

Okay now gone.
6088 2018-05-13 16:44:17 The countries you mentioned except Angola are not our mate. Saudi has $737bn while UAE has $94bn in reserve when oil price was low Saudi withdrew $213bn after the crash of oil price. NG has only $29bn in reserve then. Please those countriesain't our mate.
6089 2018-05-13 16:43:56 Hate the net spend. We sell the best RB in the league to city and are about to sell Alderweireld for poorer replacements so we don’t improve. Wish we had the Abu Dhabi oil money 
6090 2018-05-13 16:43:56 I'd oil everything down now. I know the chain oil I use does a good job.

6094 2018-05-13 16:43:40 Café Terrace at Night is a 1888 oil painting by the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh in 1888. It is also known as The Cafe Terrace on the Place du Forum, and, when first exhibited in 1891, was entitled Coffeehouse, in the evening.
6095 2018-05-13 16:43:40 And that's why Iran has no problem when we deal with Israel and as far as Russia is concerned we are now diversified our business with Russia it's not just weapons we also buy oil and natural gas from them
6096 2018-05-13 16:43:24 my mom uses white vinegar to get rid of oil on clothes!!

6099 2018-05-13 16:43:00 How many trees have you anti pipeliners or green leaders planted ? A han dful maybe ?  The oil sands reclamation work has planted millions . Much of the land looks better than when they started.
6100 2018-05-13 16:42:48 what really cleared it out for me is using body shop's tea tree face wash + toner + oil! after that i just use cetaphil and the oil with random moisturizers. i guess the key is to just clear it out first~
6101 2018-05-13 16:42:38 Too many food manufacturers are using soybean oil as an ingredient in our foods. They either don't know or don't care that lots of people including myself, are allergic to that stuff. #soyfree 
6102 2018-05-13 16:42:36 For Europe the Iran deal was heavily weighted in a new supply of lower cost oil.  Everyone agrees the security policies in the deal are weak. So Obama advisers want EU to put world safety ahead of cheaper prices at the pumps for Europeans? Smart!
6103 2018-05-13 16:42:35 Shhhhh.....don't look at oil futures.

6108 2018-05-13 16:41:51 Years of low crude oil prices and sanctions on Russian businesses by West for Crimean annexation made him a beta male. Will bounce back very soon. 
6109 2018-05-13 16:41:48 Ok I don't even know if this is a dumb question or smart question, but: when you wear spf 15 sunscreen and spf 15 tanning oil... Is that spf 30 coverage? Asking for myself

6116 2018-05-13 16:41:14 After some years crude oil is ended and after some years poles glaciers melt after some years 39-49 animal and bird species would be lost after some years due to global warming we destroys aquatic life. After some years temp of earth rise 2-3 digress so  will be in horrible state
6117 2018-05-13 16:41:09 First, it's OILSANDS you imbecile.

Second, oil from California, Nigeria and others is "dirtier" than AB's. Go protest those.

6128 2018-05-13 16:39:16 Right every one see russia as a stable investment, lol, usa is now and oil exporter getteng stronger every day,
6129 2018-05-13 16:39:15 I think there's a bunch of reasons (tho anti-44 is part of it).

Blind, bizarre support of Netanyahu (he's in political hotwater, needs a "threat" right now), and Russia badly needs higher oil prices.

And Sauds now have excuse to get nuke weapons (bc Iran will re-start).

6134 2018-05-13 16:38:44 Eventually it will fall down, take away low interest rates and govt. props this bubble would have popped. Like in ‘78 everything is driven by the price of oil.

6136 2018-05-13 16:38:29 Since Oil Price has gone up, @OfficialAPCNg led administration hasn't said anything
6137 2018-05-13 16:38:18 No, it means oil sells at $100/barrel again.
6138 2018-05-13 16:38:17 Do a before/after of the oil.
6139 2018-05-13 16:38:12 so if you fundementally disagree with that thesis, and want to say 'tribal politics trump economics', then you are telling me that the tribal political bond between eastern and western Libya TRUMPS oil.  which I understand is not ur belief at all. so which is it?

6145 2018-05-13 16:36:58 CBD oil is legal for doctors to prescribe in Utah
6146 2018-05-13 16:36:51 Its also weird to be arguing this point with you when you yourself believe that Libya is only 'One" because of oil, i.e economic relations. and because of the west's 'Oppression' of the east to control that oil
6147 2018-05-13 16:36:49 My American Airlines flight began boarding 20 minutes before the scheduled start time and now we are in a maintenance ground hold to check the oil in an engine 20 minutes after scheduled take off tine. Mercy!
6148 2018-05-13 16:36:47 Most foods with a cap have an approximate measurement in the cap. Salad oil? One tablespoon. Milk with plastic caps? One teaspoon. And so on.

6153 2018-05-13 16:36:23 I don't support the pipeline, because we shouldn't be expanding production in the oil sands. 
No one is stopping oil from leaving Canada. The BC government and First Nations are stopping a pipeline that endangers BC's coasts. The Keystone pipeline is being built as we speak.

6159 2018-05-13 16:35:37 What drives it are the Fund managers. When the housing mkt crashed they need AMEX a way to make money, so they started buying and selling oil. Before only 10% Fund were invested now 80% are.
6160 2018-05-13 16:35:30 PS It was the Soviets (and GBR) that installed a democracy in Iran in the first place in the 1940s. The Britain switched stances and backed a US/GBR coup in the country (installing the Shah) to better control the oil. They used Iran for their own gain. Nothing more.

6164 2018-05-13 16:35:07 1- One of the most misunderstood issues in #oil business: cost of producing oil in #SaudiArabia 

The low #cost figure that is widely cited is the cost of EXTRACTING the oil ONLY: 
Does not include royalties, taxes, & most importantly, the cost of the depletable resource

6169 2018-05-13 16:34:41 Oil Trade and the ammount of pockets that this trade illicitly enriches is the key factor that we can't put a ban on motor vehicles. It's also why we are stuck with fossil fuels as a power source when all our neighbours are going solar.

6180 2018-05-13 16:33:27 But why pull out without any leverage or support from the other signees and cause oil prices 2 spike (good for Iran/Russia). The only rational reason is to bait Iran into a war to remove them as a permanent threat.

6190 2018-05-13 16:31:37 No. The US was close ally to the Shah, whom they helped to install as leader, after backing a coup to depose their elected prime minister and open their nationalized oil industry to foreigners. Big difference.

6197 2018-05-13 16:30:31 Yes it's Brilliant, but how long will he live as the big oil companies will be out to get him...
6198 2018-05-13 16:30:29 Then why don't you drill for it, or sell the rights to someone who can exploit that?

Yeah, I'm familiar with those issues, but with Trump messing with the countries supplying much of our oil someone should have expected this problem.

6202 2018-05-13 16:30:12 Harley Davidson is moving to Singapore what about that and so on and so forth—tax cut only for the rich is perm. for others just temp. and will go up—$oil is going up—driving your car will be more expensive etc... I could go on but why bother to speak to dumb and dumber Trumpies!
6203 2018-05-13 16:29:58 Fuel consumption but it's related to oil usage - less lubricants, more starvation; bigger head gaps, less fuel efficiency. Using less power, unable to bring up the tyre temps. That's why the conservative modes post Australia hurt Mercedes a bit.
6204 2018-05-13 16:29:54 didn’t eat rice at a mexican restaurant last night because they cook it in both oil AND butter.. WHY?!
6205 2018-05-13 16:29:48 John #Bolton just had a fraudian slip with @jaketapper @CNN
...oil producing countries are with US against Iran...

Not mis-spelled
6206 2018-05-13 16:29:37 This is the exact problem we have with this country. Everyone wants the royalty benefits that oil produces but no one wants to support the industry. Well said Brett.
6207 2018-05-13 16:29:35 I let my mom borrow one of my bags and i left my oil pen in it FUCK LMAO
6208 2018-05-13 16:29:33 Forgot to put some of my sunflower oil this morning omfg my skin is sooo dry
6209 2018-05-13 16:29:27 Lmao someone else RTed and I did the same
6210 2018-05-13 16:29:24 Made an #lchf eggplant gratin/casserole: onion, shallots, mushrooms, cream, Grana Padano as filling. Eggplant was first brushed w/olive oil and oven-roasted. Two layers of eggplant, two layers of filling, then topped of w/mozzarella. Not bad at all,but eggplant felt a bit useless
6211 2018-05-13 16:29:22 I applied Moroccan oil to my hair and ooooo baby it’s glowing

6213 2018-05-13 16:29:19 Well, an unstable middle east means better oil sales for @realDonaldTrump FAKE @POTUS's overlord & master, putin.
6214 2018-05-13 16:29:15 I partially disagree. I don't see how oil can go much higher & be maintained. As we speak, companies are already increasing production to take advantage of the $70+ price. EV on the other hand, are already competitive and will be significantly cheaper in 5 yrs despite oil prices.
6215 2018-05-13 16:28:54 It is an air drier that increases seed flow and cools your tractor hydraulic oil. Win/Win.
6216 2018-05-13 16:28:46 That's the Genius of Pep Josef Guardiola. .. Oil dey the man brain
6217 2018-05-13 16:28:30 Wipe out old oil/butter before subsequent batter drops

6219 2018-05-13 16:28:27 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.

6229 2018-05-13 16:27:44 Guys want you to swallow their cum and they out here tasting like cod liver oil
6230 2018-05-13 16:27:39 Ive got oil on my property, untapped. It's well known in East Texas. On the TX coast, there are huge reserves, untapped since Rita. We aren't in a slack. The only detriment, really, lately, was Valero explosion in Texas City & Husky's in WI, a week apart...

6232 2018-05-13 16:27:29 Whatever happened to America first? Why don't you spend your time, energy and resources helping AMERICANS?

6233 2018-05-13 16:27:29 Nope only boi oil
6234 2018-05-13 16:27:27 You’re so right Dayna , everything trump does is to make him money ! He never arranged to get the presidency to help the people but to manipulate as much as he could while in office ! Soon he will be drilling for oil in National Parks
6235 2018-05-13 16:27:16 อันนี้แอดพิมพ์ผิดเยอะมาก ขอบคุณเป็นของคุณอีก เบลอมาค่า  ขอโทษด้วยน้าครั้งหน้าจะรอบคอบกว่านี้ค่า 
6236 2018-05-13 16:27:13 when there’s an oil spill and/or explosion by km (they have a record of spills) tourism jobs of which there are 1000s will be affected *dilbit mixed with natural gas condensate is highly explosive and could also kill 1000s why should BC take that risk?
6237 2018-05-13 16:27:10 This is a very useful article on CBD oil It goes deep into explanation on different types of pain! Neurological included which many meds don’t help much (well that’s my opinion) thank you
6238 2018-05-13 16:27:07 Day 21 of @NaturesUltra  lime oil is going to help me go through the airport today. Normally i get anxiety when flying but I’m feeling confident that i won’t have anxiety #pure #natural #CBDlife #CBDoil #glutenfree #lifestyle

6240 2018-05-13 16:26:52 If the security of The Turkana people is not going to be assured by @UKenyatta government, we say no to oil issues, we must forget this for the 100 years to come until we get a sober government, a government that loves it people 
@UKenyatta @WilliamsRuto @mercykiyonga @Lokorkor
6241 2018-05-13 16:26:50 Hope this percentage reverses. Try pachoulli oil. It's a great stress reliever.
6242 2018-05-13 16:26:47 Why don't you tell us how much more it cost to produce this biofuel compared to our regular fuels such as oil and gasoline.
6243 2018-05-13 16:26:34 I usually do butter and oil mix - lots of both!
6244 2018-05-13 16:26:19 Not a coincidence, just a clear  casuality....

The most profitable reserves of oil, minerals & so on are hidden there...so...what might we expect??

We blame against #ClimateChange, but the lobbies & de facto powers are acting...in their own profit...once more.
6245 2018-05-13 16:26:16 At least snake oil salesmen can usually give a credible sounding explanation of what benefits their particular brand of snake oil has

6249 2018-05-13 16:25:49 @narendramodi what a great tax collection done don't know 2014 was better or  2018, price of  crude oil was high in 2014 than to petrol price was low nor crude  is low but price of petrol is high, middle claas people are always struggling
6250 2018-05-13 16:25:43 Bush is a globalist and only cares about his oil investment. He did nothing when Obama rejected God and country.   His daughter supports and preaches for Planned Parenthood and they call themselves Christians
6251 2018-05-13 16:25:26 It has a shitload of butter/coconut oil in it, of course it'll take a while to drink....I can't down it as fast as you can down your mom's breastmilk josh 
6252 2018-05-13 16:25:13 Oil demand is predicted to grow over the next 50 years... Sunsetting industry? Grow up and start researching.
6253 2018-05-13 16:25:12 Canadians are asking you and your big oil buddies to stop gouging Canadians.
6254 2018-05-13 16:25:11 Beard oil.  Got it.  Time for us to hit puberty so we can grow one.
6255 2018-05-13 16:25:10 Pompeo is a snake oil salesmen. Go on Fox to present the party line. Have the Trumpist repeat until it seems like Truth. Very clever ad  folks orchestrating this. Propaganda always sounds good at first until the bill comes. Example, Corporate Welfare Bill.
6256 2018-05-13 16:24:59 add a tiny bit of oil (or butter) to the pan to act as a buffer between pancakes.

6266 2018-05-13 16:23:46 Many many thanks for all your help....really helpful..clearly Paco Melero in Vejer is the place to go for Eltinto beef (and much more). Slightly worried about our timing so the market in Cadiz sounds a good back-up...does Jerez have a decent market too ?
6267 2018-05-13 16:23:43 Oooo! Thanks! Will check this out. If it saves a supermarket trip so much the better :-) Far too stressful once you've considered Fairtrade, palm oil status, air freighting, seasonality and plastic packaging!

Those fuckers make it square though, which is weird. But I admit I sort of like it.

6279 2018-05-13 16:22:22 Alberta is dirt poor because the Conservatives squandered tens of billion and even hundreds of billions of dollars of that oil money. Norway saved 1 trillion dollars via Norways version of NDP. Conservatives are the worst.

6283 2018-05-13 16:22:01 Kravitz reports that Ocon's pitstop issue was caused due to tape coming off the cake tin (brake cover) and dislodging causing the wheel not to go on properly. His DNF was a result of oil pressure loss
6284 2018-05-13 16:22:00 So how should the Fed handle rising oil prices, JD?
6285 2018-05-13 16:21:40 I worked in the oil sands safety training sector back when Prentice/Harper were in power. The oil sands started tanking BEFORE Notley and Trudeau. People were freaking out, alarms were going off, business dropped dramatically.

I was unemployed by the time Notley was elected.

6299 2018-05-13 16:19:10 No integrity, Obama didn't get Congress approval. Europe did it for oil. Only reason they are staying in. Our country was the country that gave them money. We paid and Iran make trillions of dollars and used it for Terrorist in the middle east and world.

6307 2018-05-13 16:18:24 Er, the market, private sector, provides all that. United States went from net importer to exporter of oil. Why are we still importing oil from Middle East? That’s the point.

6325 2018-05-13 16:15:26 Ok then, explain to me then how blocking our oil to market is going to reduce climate change?  And if you bring up increased tanker traffic you better have some data to show the harm. If you can do this without getting insulting, it would be appreciated.

6330 2018-05-13 16:15:04 Looking forward to a week of news and strong share price performance from #TXP. 

Increasing production + higher oil prices + gearing + currently undervalued = good news for shareholders.
6331 2018-05-13 16:14:59 "a proposed $3 million agreement with two companies that's intended to end the possibility of drilling for oil and gas from the surfaces of any properties within the city limits."

So the city will pay $3 million to stop companies from drilling? Why so poorly worded & vague?

6335 2018-05-13 16:14:40 I sometimes use coconut oil instead of butter. It gives the eggs a nice flavor.
6336 2018-05-13 16:14:38 Saturday night dinner. Chicken Milanese with Arugula Tomato Garlic white Balsamic and extra Virgjn olive oil on top. Used the first of my fresh basil too.  Corn on the cob. Zucchini with onions and tomato, basil and Pecorino.

6338 2018-05-13 16:14:18 Mental image: dejected train quietly chugs off to nearest pub, spends afternoon drinking whiskey/engine oil cocktails and muttering about maybe switching to being a freight train instead 
6339 2018-05-13 16:14:16 How dumb are you ? Eu cause the Cold War with Russia . Eu and Obama sanctioned Exxon costing us hundreds of billions of dollars a year . Negotiating minisk Germany and France cut Nordstream to buy Russian and Iranian oil . More sanction hit Russia for dealing with Iran .
6340 2018-05-13 16:14:10 RRL Range Resources.... directors buy in at 0.8p current price for a share is 0.23p..... in mid 2018 a low risk money earner starts in Indonesia.... price of oil per barrel is the highest it's been for 3 years......RRL has its own drilling company.....
6341 2018-05-13 16:13:59 So in summary: worst arsenal team ever, 6th. The champions, 5th. The greatest team in the world with best player in the world and best manager everyone wanted to replace AW, 4th. The long ball spendthrifts, 2nd. Amazingly the club financed by a small oil producing state came 1st
6342 2018-05-13 16:13:35 Shoud we rejoice if @TristinHopper quote the totally unbiased UofC and MacDonald-Laurier instead of the Fraser Institute to argue that oil is best refined close to market just like beer?
6343 2018-05-13 16:13:21 SNAKE OIL CHARLIE has been scratched from Race 7 today @MonmouthPark for trainer Maroun. Reason unavailable at this time.
6344 2018-05-13 16:13:19 .@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @VP @PressSec @SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @RepKevinBrady

Headlines in the @HoustonChron today:

"Trump withdraws from Iran nuclear deal, fueling backlash and boosting oil prices." 

What about the Americans who support the move? Not a drop of ink about that
6345 2018-05-13 16:13:03 The vast majority of the oil we import comes from the United States. The vast majority of those working in supporting the oil industry are working. Alberta still has the highest wages, lowest taxes, fastest growth. What's the problem?
6346 2018-05-13 16:12:59 @theNETng  u all wanna spite Skales with dat stupid interview even when he said he doesnt want it realeased, ur anchor shld be changing oil in generator #Rubbish
6347 2018-05-13 16:12:52 Tell that to Suncor.  The last profitable oil sands resource company we have.  An oil refinery IS not difficult to build. Its simple technology.  Most of the refineries in North American are on their last legs. There is a huge need to rebuild refinery capacity.  Why Not Alberta!
6348 2018-05-13 16:12:49 Friends who have oil diffusers in their office for various reasons. Yay or neigh?
6349 2018-05-13 16:12:49 He also helped Russia in a big way this week by driving up oil prices. Putin may be the only person ever to get his money's worth out of @realDonaldTrump

6353 2018-05-13 16:12:43 Gas prices affect our every day living!  Higher gas prices are only benefiting the oil companies!  When you have to go without food so you can fill your tank to go to get to work, we know there is an issue!
6354 2018-05-13 16:12:39 Could you imagine their outrage if they had won in 2014 and there had been calls for a second referendum in the wake of the falling oil price?

6360 2018-05-13 16:11:45 It was close between Yakupov & Ryan Murray at the time, essentially split with a slight edge to Yak. They added Hall, RNH already, there was a real possibility of taking a D. Then there’s the Katz rumour but Yak wasn’t a given

6377 2018-05-13 16:09:47 You are that dumb ? Seriously reply. Staying in deal helps Russia . Eu helped sanctioned Exxon costing hundred of billions meanwhile Germany and France negotiating minisk made a trade agreement with Russia for Nordstream 2 .buying Russian and Iranians oil .
6378 2018-05-13 16:09:43 I worked in Kazakhstan after the fall of communism.  Miles upon miles of polluted land everywhere, blowouts that would blow oil and gas for months. Industrial yards full of  rotted machinery. My translator explained it was because the state owned everything so no one cares.

6380 2018-05-13 16:09:25 Pffft to calories. I only use lard/dripping for Y.Puds. It’s only a teaspoonful. Oil is too… oily.
6381 2018-05-13 16:09:24 gun oil is incredible
6382 2018-05-13 16:09:09 Im not talking about oil im talking about organizing a coup to overthrow their government and stealing money from them. Also selling them missles in the first place for iran/contra.

6388 2018-05-13 16:08:34 if your squad's country is not one of the world's top 5 most olive oil exporting nations, you are doing it wrong
6389 2018-05-13 16:08:28 City can't really complain about anything as they're an oil bloated cynical project. Even they must be wondering who won the league though with the passionate jubilant bumming Liverpool are getting from the media for scraping 4th.
6390 2018-05-13 16:08:24 The point is lazy identity marketing (masquerading as virtue) has limits.  HRC lost because she rarely spoke to or justified her candidacy on the basis of peace and prosperity.  Trump did.  He won. He may be a vain, vulgar snake oil salesman, but he never put virtue on parade.
6391 2018-05-13 16:07:45 Arsenal did both that season, without bottomless vaults of oil money.
6392 2018-05-13 16:07:44 Great read. Didn’t get thru all but saved it for later. Still think blocking our oil to market and derailing our economy will do little to help climate but a lot to hurt Canadians.
6393 2018-05-13 16:07:40 It works with the 4 trays too, its just getting the oven hot enough and keeping the heat consistent once they are in. Also using lard/dripping works better than oil. Rubbish for calories but sometimes its best not to care lol.
6394 2018-05-13 16:07:28 They attacked democracy’s vulnerabilities. We must counterattack their vulnerabilities: the nontransparent pilfering, hiding, moving, exchanging of wealth in whatever form of exchange (currency, gems, oil, real estate, contracts/promises, donations, art, antiquities, slaves,...).

6396 2018-05-13 16:07:16 You need to first come to term or disagree that during the oil boom other nations you mentioned used to rescue their nation when oil price dropped as low as $28 in 2015, was actually DEPLETED by the previous admin down to $28B from what it was in 2010 & added nothing.
Do u agree?

6403 2018-05-13 16:06:12 - use tissue oil & a body scrub of your choice. oats infused body scrubs are usually A1 but find one you'd love.. use it when you bath then use the tissue oil after every bath & at night. they'll fade with time..as long as you use it effectively.

6407 2018-05-13 16:05:53 And the killings are still on yet the so called Policemen of the world are not bothered because of oil money!
6408 2018-05-13 16:05:52 Food prices will inevitably go on the rise as they realise that they need the outside world more than the outside world needs them. Seriously what does the english contribute to the rest of the world besides pharmaceuticals, oil, gas and tobacco?
6409 2018-05-13 16:05:52 So you tell me. What religion do we know of, that is in alignment with the #left, that has A LOT of money (say, thru oil?) to pay our media, just like China has with Hollywood movies, that DOES want our "bras" back on? That DOES want us UN-liberated? Would it pay @people undo it?

6419 2018-05-13 16:04:00 No, just pipeline proponents get grants from Trudeau, like the $65M being pd to 13 ppl to 'monitor construction of the pipeline', whatever that means.

Amazing how much money CDA has for oil co.s, but won't fix the messes resource extraction has made of water on reserves.
6420 2018-05-13 16:03:37 Also please explain to me how backing the KM pipeline is in anyway at odds with "inclusivity"?

As far as vibrant planet goes we have the largest stable oil reserves with the highest environmental standards in the world.

Did BP stop drilling after contaminating the Caribbean?

6440 2018-05-13 16:01:41 I prefer "dry film" sprays that contain rust inhibitors and detergents in addition to PTFE (PTFE on its own does nothing to prevent rust or clean out lingering dirt). Houdini is very good but is a proprietary oil blend, Synco SuperLube with PTFE is pretty good too.

6444 2018-05-13 16:01:07 2.. However the method is questionable. The inclusion of KSA is surprising. I am from oil and gas industry and my experience says KSA industries apply very good pollution control equipments. The industries in yanbu and jubail are at a distance from residential areas.

6450 2018-05-13 16:00:22 Helpful info: The good bacteria in our gut grow better when we eat a diet rich omega-3 (found in fish oil) or in dietary fibre, which is found in fruit and veg and is also particularly high in foods such as wholemeal bread, nuts, oats, beans and dark chocolate.

6454 2018-05-13 16:00:09 You probably remember your oil changes, but don't forget about your filters! Dirty filters can increase your fuel usage by as much as 10%.

6458 2018-05-13 15:59:53 The two biggest reasons Oilers took Yak at No. 1 is b/c there was no other real option to take at that spot, at the time, and the owner made it known who he wanted.

6467 2018-05-13 15:58:20 How evil Hillary and group are also. What is around Cuba and South of Cuba? Probably the last bit of fishing grounds on earth. They stocked piled oil tankers there. Guess, very big oil spill. Come to mind. They eat people not fish. Wake up.
6468 2018-05-13 15:58:16 oh I really am pleased to hear that! Brilliant news.
6469 2018-05-13 15:58:02 You can leave out the tahini... I usually do for similar reasons. Add maybe 1, 2 tbsp of olive oil instead... adjust other flavors in the recipe as necessary.
6470 2018-05-13 15:57:52 The fact is that Fawad Rana is the Managing director of Qatar Lubricant co. a leading oil company of Qatar. #PrideOfLahore

6473 2018-05-13 15:57:11 Logan, Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off Buildings. How can the green left rationalize obstructing  Gay friendly Oil while enriching Gay killing #bloodoil? @vancouverpride

6477 2018-05-13 15:56:54 The problem with Thatcherism is that you eventually run out of North Sea Oil to fuel your shitty policies.
6478 2018-05-13 15:56:45 Wow. I don’t know how they do it. I mean apart from the oil billions that is.
6479 2018-05-13 15:56:32 It does not need rocket science to see that this is the money that has been used to oil the campaign machinery, new vehicles, bikes, billboards, regalia,etc
6480 2018-05-13 15:56:23 Soon is gonna arrived to America if people don't stand up to stop it.That the Democrats plan than they can have a oil deal..

6482 2018-05-13 15:56:19 Any healthy, sane society doesn't throw a tantrum when they can't get oil and fund extremist groups to show the nasty commies who's boss and wonder how they were able to fly planes into skyscrapers a couple decades later.
6483 2018-05-13 15:56:04 Thanks God for Oil money
6484 2018-05-13 15:56:03 ngerik ya 
6485 2018-05-13 15:55:40 You obviously don’t know that when crude oil is short for one person it’s short for everyone meaning they have to raise their prices to meet the rising costs of crude oil barrels. But go ahead and explain to an aspiring finance and petroleum engineer double major how it works
6486 2018-05-13 15:55:39 And Cadiz market is superb so can’t go wrong there. I second @anniebennett - Paco Melero in Vejer is great.

6488 2018-05-13 15:55:29 Manchester City has completed the centennial. In 15 years when oil is obsolete, manchester city fan tv will remember the centennial and look back when they were on top of the world.

6497 2018-05-13 15:54:13 The snake oil salesmen told the American public he's going to bring jobs back to America. Most corrupt and unethical US president ever.
6498 2018-05-13 15:54:11 As much as I take the piss about oil money any team getting 100 points in a PL season is a brilliant achievement, fair play city. #City100
6499 2018-05-13 15:53:57 Here’s the thing...it does work. But there are lots of snake oil merchants who don’t know the first thing about doing it correctly.
6500 2018-05-13 15:53:55 @OliveOliveUK thank you for the oil & halloumi. Lovely to meet Pam. Got home and griddled some halloumi, what can I say but delicious . Wrapped in an Italian flatbread with tomatoes, basil & seasoned and dressed with olive oil. Happy husband & son! @AlthorpFoodFest
6501 2018-05-13 15:53:51 Hmm so want to oil and lick that last one! 
6502 2018-05-13 15:53:46 Hopefully this coconut oil works 
6503 2018-05-13 15:53:42 For real, politics aside, I live in Alberta and work in oil and gas(when employed), and it sure seems like it’s slower right now than in 2008 when the bottom fell out. Am I the only one who feel this way?
6504 2018-05-13 15:53:38 Oil has gone up dude just sayn and if middle east nuke free well then get them out of Isreal.

6506 2018-05-13 15:53:24 ADAM's the ultimate score, kid. No more grifts. No more scams. A monopoly on ADAM makes Standard Oil look like the Piggly Wiggly.
6507 2018-05-13 15:53:16 Put your money into renewables without attacking the oil industry. You hurt the poor people and the environment by attacking safe oil transportation(pipeline) and using local oil. ( eastern canada imports  Middle East oil)
6508 2018-05-13 15:53:12 Oil money....Pep is still bald....that is all

6514 2018-05-13 15:52:32 Add scientific assurances, ‘NP’, about cigarettes, Thalidomide, silicon breast implants, vaginal mesh, Agent Orange, fracking, oil exploration off coast of Florida. Add syphilis trials and sterilization of black people. Add eugenics. Nazi Drs. All respected science, at one time
6515 2018-05-13 15:51:58 As will America when gas becomes too expensive for those who got a tax break equal to the cost of a Costco membership.  The oil investors will benefit.
6516 2018-05-13 15:51:54 Helps to have oil money
6517 2018-05-13 15:51:42 Quienes creemos en la democracia liberal tenemos de ejemplo a Teddy Roosevelt. Un presidente progresista que no aceptó el chantaje de las corporaciones empresarias. Aprobó leyes modelo anti monopolios, se enfrentó a la JP Morgan y Standard Oil y así dinamizó la economía

Hands down. It’s easy to avoid palm oil, quorn, and slave trade products,  can’t say that about nonvegans
6521 2018-05-13 15:51:18 Well done Ken!!
6522 2018-05-13 15:51:16 So @TristinHopper argued that oil is a perishable product and basic unleaded regular is best refined close to market #SameOld???

6529 2018-05-13 15:50:19 I ran out of extra virgin olive oil, and I'm starting to sweat. Must. Go. Grocery. Shopping. Now. #SpanishProblems
6530 2018-05-13 15:50:18 city hit 100 points, oh what oil money can do
6531 2018-05-13 15:49:57 He is a con artist. Since he has taken office, our taxes have increased 40+% plus    Oil is up from $27 per barrel to $70 per barrel and will go up even more.  Prices on produce is higher, too and we don’t have the same selections. Sad.
6532 2018-05-13 15:49:32 That's so cool! God's Own Oil?

6542 2018-05-13 15:48:23 Oh, Joey. It’s going to be a rough year for you. Trump is a fraud and a snake oil salesman and he’s going to humiliate all those who believe he can do no wrong. Just read about Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort. You don’t have to go down with the ship. 
6543 2018-05-13 15:48:20 BP has contained the oil spill.... to just a single planet. #lol
6544 2018-05-13 15:48:15 Josh "Oil Tot" Middleton (The Rapper Edition) that's perfect. The world could use a new British rapper and with your Disney like singing voice this could work very well! Hugs for this future wrapper. I mean rapper!
6545 2018-05-13 15:48:14 I need my nails brows & lashes done tomorrow also have to get oil change for my baby
6546 2018-05-13 15:48:06 No problems with Americans always in our media? @algore being the most recent, trashing our oil industry.
6547 2018-05-13 15:47:46 ...border, will continue to opt for heavy, sour imported crude, but if oil production, exports from U.S. shale continues to skyrocket, the U.S. will have more oil than needed to satisfy domestic use. So, how about we settle on simply achieving U.S. energy security?
6548 2018-05-13 15:47:39 so i started heating up my pan and put some oil in it, went to the ridge and saw that there was no juevos !!! well
6549 2018-05-13 15:47:38 Lol. Ok. So what is the better outcome by eating cows? Are you claiming none of the things you mentioned happens by doing so??
Do you how how much more destruction goes on not going vegan causes? 
 Don’t eat palm oil, quinoa ,quorn products, that simple.
6550 2018-05-13 15:46:32 We won't use peanut oil for any products made for Monday's game.
6551 2018-05-13 15:46:29 สรุปคืออยากให้ปลูกฝังลูกเรื่องการเรียนได้แล้ว นี่เป็นห่วงนะ กลัวโตมาแล้วโง่ 
ส่วนเรื่องอื่นๆ ก็อยากให้สอนให้มันพึ่งตัวเองให้มากๆ อะไรเริ่มไม่ดีก็ดุมันสิ จะมาอ้างว่ายังเด็กๆๆๆๆๆๆ ถ้างั้นก็แล้วแต่เถอะ กู 19 ยังคิดได้เลย
6552 2018-05-13 15:46:25 You and Alex Jones hate competition.   After seeing another temper tantrum from Alex during the limited Syrian strike, i realized he is no better than Keith Olbermann or Rosie O’Donnel.   Q may or may not be real but at least, he’s not selling snake oil and screaming all the time
6553 2018-05-13 15:45:56 I bought an essential oil diffuser necklace and I’m already dying for it to get here.
6554 2018-05-13 15:45:56 I just don't understand how startups can be created in a Silicon Valley this expensive by anyone but established players. It's like watching a petrostate destroy itself with oil revenue.
6555 2018-05-13 15:45:55 Gave the mechanicmy number. Liked him since my last oil change. I pulled he saw me and came and gave me a big bearhug. Oh he is a redhead I just don’t like how he smell like cars

6557 2018-05-13 15:45:23 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
6558 2018-05-13 15:45:18 @AldiUK I have started to use your stores in Glasgow however I'm very concerned that your products still contain palm oil. What are your plans to move away from this product that is contributing to deforestation?
6559 2018-05-13 15:45:12 Monsieur Carr ....have you not watched Fawlty Towers?
'I' come from barcelona. Mr fawlty is a rat...it's Bernie in Spain !??

6562 2018-05-13 15:44:37 Curly fries fried in wagyu oil dipped in aioli sauce, yassssss bitch!!!
6563 2018-05-13 15:44:29 Ah! You didn’t read my tweet correctly - I need to know if it’s from a “sustainable” source, or is it from “#deforestation” - that’s what I need to know @10DowningStreet 

Your labelling just states “Palm Oil” which isn’t enough for us to make an informed choice. 

Thank you.
6564 2018-05-13 15:44:01 Some sort of vinegar-ey rice stuff with herbs or something, and the whole thing dipped with olive oil.

It's extremely good.

6568 2018-05-13 15:43:28 I wash with Pure Soap, use witch hazel as a toner and I use Eucerin Oil Control Dry Touch during the day and I use Johnson & Johnson Even Tone night moisturiser at night.
6569 2018-05-13 15:43:23 @RepSteveChabot  gasoline almost $3.00 a gallon.  Big Oil companies are colluding, fixing prices and of course have monopolized the market.  What is government going to do about it??
6570 2018-05-13 15:43:22 Ooh I actually love those haha, I put vintage cheddar on top and rub the buns with smoked paprika oil and it's gorgeous 
6571 2018-05-13 15:43:16 Obama proved to be nothing but slippery snake oil salesman. It’s a BIG win for America that people are waking up to the truth and inspired to think freely #TrumpEra will be the best in my lifetime.
6572 2018-05-13 15:42:53 If you live in a major city or drive less than 100 miles a day buy a Electric car . No pollution and you not getting ripped or by Big oil , Ethanol companies and Trumps DC Swamp Gas . Cars are not the cars of the past new EV are actually very efficient less moving parts to break
6573 2018-05-13 15:42:47 @LeoDiCaprio Leo wants to help a country, which with only one comment of his inclines towards good. is a support to Gustavo Petro who struggles to deal with oil and coal for renewable energies. He is the only one in my oais who wants this. we just want to save the world ...
6574 2018-05-13 15:42:44 Heavens, that oil isn't looking so quaint now

6577 2018-05-13 15:42:20 Not dictating anything why would you buy foreign oil and support another country not your neighbour that buys your forest products is a major contributor to your tourism industry as for the sewage you are only solving 15% of what you dump into the ocean i

6579 2018-05-13 15:42:17 Yeah, I know! That’s why I kind of want to cut it shoulder length so I don’t have to deal with this nonsense. I had to do a coconut oil treatment the other day because my hair got so tangled.  no i haven’t! I need to go look for it.

6583 2018-05-13 15:41:39 Wow, Pamela, an age long secret is being revealed by UK PM Theresa May, UK is for long sustained by innocent blood. You must have heard of #BIAFRA, more than 6Millions of their citizens were wasted by Nigerians to sustain the flow of #BIAFRA oil for UK, killing is on till date.
6584 2018-05-13 15:41:34 XBio-oil pubblicita': una donna distrutta e vagamente depressa perche' non risolve il problema delle smagliature. Poi usa xbio oil e si scopre che ci ha anche un bambino ed e' grazie all'olio, mica al bambino che sorride di nuovo. Ha sconfitto le smagliature! Poveri noi...
6585 2018-05-13 15:41:30 Coconut oil internally(in coffee, tea, or alone) and topically will help.

6588 2018-05-13 15:41:15 Got to @jiffylube at 10:20. Dropped car off. Then left jiffy lube at 11:20. Nothing was done right. I ask for blend oil change and rotation.  They use full synthetic and don’t bother to rotate. Back to jiffy lube at 11:35.... waiting.
6589 2018-05-13 15:41:14 According to CNN, oil watchers are predicting a surge of volatility, spiking 19% just this year. Since oil is a resource in production, the increase in prices would therefore shift AS to the left, increasing price level and decreasing GDP.
6590 2018-05-13 15:41:02 me: oh is that a Maserati
oil: ALLY THATS A PORCHE. IT LITERALLY SAYS PORCHE RIGHT THERE
6591 2018-05-13 15:40:47 These are the same geniuses that said that the in Iraq we would be treated as liberators, the oil would pay for the war & there were WMDs. Now it's Israel will support it? Same shit, same assholes, same republicans, enough of stupid wars! #NeoCon2ndRound
6592 2018-05-13 15:40:43 They're people infected by a violent ideology. Think strategically, you can't ban Muslims since It's Oil money that funds their mosques. Europe needs to ban Arab lobby and isolate Muslim leadership, and all the zombies get confused.
6593 2018-05-13 15:40:42 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
6594 2018-05-13 15:40:42 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
6595 2018-05-13 15:40:38 Completly forgot! Dalda Cooking Oil (advertisments)...please stop putting little girls in kitchen cooking chappatis on Mother's Day. They should be shown flying F-16's and scaling the highest mountains. Cooking is an asset but little girls should dream outside of the kitchen.

6597 2018-05-13 15:40:18 แล้วอิเรื่องว่าถ้ามันโตจะให้นี่สอนการบ้านนี่ขอบายนะ ไม่ใช่เกลียดหรือขี้เกียจอะไรด้วย แต่ดูจากนิสัยก็คงจะแบบมันทำไม่ได้ก็จะโยนๆ มาให้นี่รับผิดชอบสอนใหม่ แบบนี้แหละสปอย เสียนิสัย ตอนนี่เด็กๆ ทำการบ้านไม่เป็น ไปให้พ่อกับแม่สอน เขายังไม่สอนนี่เลย เขาบอกให้กลับไปคิดดีๆ ว่าครูสอนอะไรมา
6598 2018-05-13 15:40:15 Man City never forget are a tinpot team with oil money

6600 2018-05-13 15:40:05 Who will benefit from higher oil prices? Trumputo and Putin
6601 2018-05-13 15:40:02 Nope. Palm oil. Quinoa. The carcinogenic fungus in Quorn products. Deforestation on a massive scale, destroying species we've not even discovered, forcing undocumented workers to slave away just so you can avoid eating a cow.
Toxic veganism ^is^ that path.
6602 2018-05-13 15:39:47 The sewage problem is being fixed as we speak. No one is dictating what we do. Some people are protecting BCs environment. They should have that right. Aren't you trying to dictate where BC buys its oil?
6603 2018-05-13 15:39:42 Exactly! They used baby oil on my shit and now I got a bunch of tiny bumps around my eyebrows 
6604 2018-05-13 15:39:42 Not to mention the oil China and Russia and Kanell sell to them and they in turn sell their goods
6605 2018-05-13 15:39:31 revealed: every time Mr. Drumpf starts whining, a member of congress whispers #covfefe
6606 2018-05-13 15:39:28 Glad you enjoyed the olive oil experience. would love to join you in a vinegar tasting one day
6607 2018-05-13 15:39:25 @realDonaldTrump   collusion yes, not you and the Russians,  BIG OIL is where it is. Price fixing, monopoly,  it all adds up to screwing we the citizens.  A big part of my tax cut money is going to the oil companies.  there is no legitimate reason for the price of gasoline.
6608 2018-05-13 15:38:54 Congratulations Ken!!!
6609 2018-05-13 15:38:35 Lucky! I'm changing oil and baking a quiche. Enjoy the sun for us!
6610 2018-05-13 15:38:32 Fossil fuels depleting? We're drowning in oil. I'm not against renewables but that tech is far from the capability to replace oil as the main source of power. Just out of curiosity, which specific original systems are you referring to as being worth preserving?
6611 2018-05-13 15:38:21 Yet you show oil city vs Southampton live, just because it's lord pep? No wonder you're losing subscription numbers
6612 2018-05-13 15:38:21 Oil billionaires give millions of Dollars to GOP to do what ever needed to increase crude oil prices. Guess what happens to gasoline and diesel prices? Steep increases. Bought gas lately?  #Butta
6613 2018-05-13 15:38:04 แล้วนี่ก็เชื่อมากๆ ด้วยว่าตอนเล็กโดนป้อนอะไรไปบ่อยๆ แม่งก็จำยันโตอ่ะ ตอนเด็กมันเล่นโทสับ โตไปมันก็ยิ่งเล่น ถ้าถึงวันนั้นอย่าบ่นนะ เพราะสอนมันเอง
6614 2018-05-13 15:38:00 Also? Especially when i use body oil after a shower, I wash my towels with baking soda and vinegar to dissolve the oil and keep the towels from smelling.
6615 2018-05-13 15:37:55 Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest.
2 Kings 4:7
6616 2018-05-13 15:37:54 Some In the shower body oil,
Daisy by Marc jacobs the eau so fresh one ,my faaaave 
& vanilla baby lotion
6617 2018-05-13 15:37:53 Pay attention, I will repeat it again. The difference is that when oil prices rebounded, we did not have to pay money to past accumulated debt, but could put it towards schools & hospitals. Notley's spending will not allow us to do that this time. It will all go to debt interest.
6618 2018-05-13 15:37:49 Oil price increase.
6619 2018-05-13 15:37:34 THANK god that baby oil took off all my tan
6620 2018-05-13 15:37:31 Make a pizza! Use a base of sun-dried tomato oil and fresh parmesan, add tuna and bake. Top with avocado slices.
6621 2018-05-13 15:37:25 We are going to see 100or close before that imho... We are in deficit right now. Eventually it will be the oil price that will push the economy into recession but we are months away from that.
6622 2018-05-13 15:37:19 Iran's oil  was pretty much earmarked  for  china,  I  got this  fr  chinese  news  when that  deal was  at it's  final  stage.Saudis hated it
6623 2018-05-13 15:37:14 Don’t call me nuts but what about the food u make with peanut oil?
6624 2018-05-13 15:37:04 I wouldn’t say so. Certainly oil fields and refineries.
6625 2018-05-13 15:37:00 Yes, Iran is a threat, but let’s look at the real motivation here. Who benefits from your actions regarding Iran? Russia, their struggling oil industry, and your Vlad Dad - and ultimately you via that relationship. Vlad wanted this so you saluted and said yes, sir!!!
6626 2018-05-13 15:36:56 I love that conclusion, Beauty and Brain.

6627 2018-05-13 15:36:54 แล้วพูดอะไรมากก็ไม่ได้ ตามประสาคนเด็กกว่า แต่ก็ควรคิดได้ป่ะว่าสิ่งที่ควรสอนลูกตอนเล็กๆ คือสอนมันท่องกอไก่อ่ะ เอบีซีก็สอนไปดิ นับเลขก็สอนไป นี่สอนมันเล่นโทสับ ดูยูทูป ก็แล้วแต่เหอะ โตมาโง่ก็อย่าบ่นเนาะ
6628 2018-05-13 15:36:42 ทำได้แค่เพียงนั่งมองน้องอยู่ห่าง ๆ
6629 2018-05-13 15:36:26 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS > U cannot have gas prices spike this summer and cont economic boom. We have more oil than anyone. Why should gas prices spike? Cuts into disposable income > economy slows. Don’t let this happen.
6630 2018-05-13 15:36:20 อันนี้คือจบแล้วหรอ
6631 2018-05-13 15:36:12 Poorly photo shopped
6632 2018-05-13 15:36:04 The Saudis are funding a HUGE mosque in Fort MacMurray.. I think they want to locate strategically near to our oil, too.  I realize they don't need oil but they need to control the price of it.
6633 2018-05-13 15:35:56 There was an earlier video where she was rubbing baby oil on herself and it sounded like sandpaper, probably what happens when you seldom bathe.
6634 2018-05-13 15:35:55 i’m trying to do that hack where you get fake tan off with baby oil but thus far, all that’s happened is i now understand what dolphins must feel like all the time
6635 2018-05-13 15:35:53 ไม่แก้ปมอะไรทั้งนั้น วันๆแก้ปมฟิคก็ยากพอแล้ว
6636 2018-05-13 15:35:46 ไม่มีใครสวยเกินคนนี้ล้าววว
6637 2018-05-13 15:35:40 Actually is OIL
6638 2018-05-13 15:35:39 The continued increasing returns for each barrel of oil we sell is just in time to justify more  political spending during the upcoming election. Lord...please lift this burden of “cynicism” from me!
6639 2018-05-13 15:35:17 5/5B ...when we’re dependent on Middle East & China for oil & natural gas at far higher prices.

No one who supports US small & medium biz—esp manufacturing—should support exporting our oil & natural gas—which is why energy prices are higher now & will be unaffordable later.)
6640 2018-05-13 15:35:17 Helping solar along costs FAR less than the de facto subsidies of maintaining troops overseas to control the oil market.  While we're allegedly bringing freedom and democracy to nations like Iraq, we turn a blind eye to the monarchy rule in Saudi Arabia.
6641 2018-05-13 15:35:16 yoga, or a good cbd oil helps too
6642 2018-05-13 15:35:13 So Fox News and GOP leadership wag the dog all the way to the bank in oil money.
6643 2018-05-13 15:35:00 เพราะงั้นไม่ต้องมามองว่ากูใช้เงินเยอะ ก็เออใช้เยอะค่ะ แต่เงินกูเอง ไม่ได้ไปเบียดเบียนคนอื่นอย่างที่ใครบางคนทำ
6644 2018-05-13 15:34:59 Yes. But we need to SELL our oil and NOT phase it out. That’s the point.
6645 2018-05-13 15:34:59 The response is to add a little avocado oil to the regular canola oil dressing so they can put it prominently on the label!
6646 2018-05-13 15:34:52 Is that why the announcement of Trump's led 2 increase in oil prices which benefitting Russian as well just before Nathanhue visiting Putin?!  Creepy & crafty 
6647 2018-05-13 15:34:38 I burped and it tasted like fish (gross i know) but I haven’t eaten fish at all. Then I remembered I’m taking fish oil pills
6648 2018-05-13 15:34:33 Hapi to have the oil Mogul with us op sir u give us a bit insight to ur success.... Thanks sir
6649 2018-05-13 15:34:32 With no oil 
6650 2018-05-13 15:34:27 I believed, had it been oil prices are at below $40 mark, without the windfalls in the TSA account today, state's not been bail out to pay salaries, and to top it all our foreign reserve at below $20 billion.
I bet you, what we will hear is PMB most fix it.

Then no coalitions.

2 tbsps crude diesel
Then crushed garlic

6659 2018-05-13 15:33:38 It's great, I agree!  Lower taxes, companies hiring, consumer confidence sky high, unemployment at record lows, NoKo bending the knee, Iran about to bend the knee, no more phoney Paris accord, oil exports on the rise... I mean, what more could you ask for? 

#MAGA
#KAG
6660 2018-05-13 15:33:33 NOTE TO SELF. Don't drink chili oil, ever again.
6661 2018-05-13 15:33:20 That’s a great brand, Jean! I store the PB upside down until I open it, which help a lot. Then use a butter knife and jab it from the top down a bunch of times to incorporate the oil. Then slowly and gently stir until uniform. Congrats on the upgrade, should have got crunchy!

6663 2018-05-13 15:33:16 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.

6666 2018-05-13 15:32:59 What a pity Doris (Jill Pennington) didn't make it over the mountains today. I have the world supply of new season sparrow's arse which I am about to oven roast in olive oil and garlic. Nom-nom. All the more for me :)
6667 2018-05-13 15:32:52 There are a lot of exceptional people in BC beautiful province we understand their concerns for the coast but they cannot play it both ways you cannot deny export oil then import and the rules of law must prevail above all and majority rules
6668 2018-05-13 15:32:45 #askcrofty so you think the new oil burning checks in quali have affected Ferrari?
6669 2018-05-13 15:32:38 เเต่เราในอายุ 19 ก็มองว่าการอยากเลี้ยงลูกให้สบายเป็นเรื่องที่ดี แต่ก็ไม่ใช่เลี้ยงให้สบายจนมันลำบากไม่เป็น อยากได้อะไรอ่ะซื้อ ซื้อ ซื้อให้ แต่ตัวเองลำบาก ต้องมาขอเงินคนอื่นนี่ใช่มั้ยก็ลองคิดดูเอาเนาะ
6670 2018-05-13 15:32:31 1. Eggs with bacon.
2. Fruits with yogurt. 
3. Stake with fat cheese plus salad. Salad with olive oil.
4. 200g fat curd just curd thats it.
5. Boiled eggs with mayonnaise. 
6. Before sleep just fat milk. 
Just with more fat in your diet you loose belly fat and no carbs.

6672 2018-05-13 15:32:13 Enjoy the Europa League next season. The oil money is running out, so it was coming and it will get worse.
6673 2018-05-13 15:31:35 My cars pissing oil, I need carbs ASAP. Can I ring my breakdown company?
6674 2018-05-13 15:31:31 5555555555 อันนั้นยอมเยยย
6675 2018-05-13 15:31:30 And that in order to make the oil we rely on last, new technologies and energy sources have to be developed.
6676 2018-05-13 15:31:28 Who said anything about “far more monetary leverage”? Why would they need “far more”? Apparently, climate $cientists sell themselves cheaply and the MSM is always eager to spread fear.

And if the oil industry offends you so much, stop using their products.

6678 2018-05-13 15:31:06 Yes yr analysis is bang on, but if you micro analyze, a lot of things are happening in the background, the big multinationals do not wish to be out of the game for too long, at least in the Oil and Gas industry, one of the examples is the NOV facility outside Moscow, started ‘16
6679 2018-05-13 15:30:58 Oil guards? Or would that be their Saudi Arabian counterparts…
6680 2018-05-13 15:30:57 Do what feels right to you but make sure you explain the change. I’m partial to your current channel name, but, it’s only because I’m a wife of an oil man as well and worked in the patch myself.
6681 2018-05-13 15:30:55 Getting ah oil change
6682 2018-05-13 15:30:50 He is ignorant and doesn’t want to learn. He had McMaster who tried to explain but Trump is just a #MORON. Watch @TheLoomingTower and see how the CIA was not willing to blame the Saudi’s for 9/11 because we needed their oil. I call BS.  Read or watch The Looming Tower.
6683 2018-05-13 15:30:48 Snake oil is a molecule comprising a number of individual elements.
6684 2018-05-13 15:30:44 Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation has announced the appointment of Group General Manager, Crude Oil Marketing Division, Mele Kyari as Nigeria’s National Representative to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
6685 2018-05-12 23:59:57 It herts to buy 12k service oil and then some.  That would have done my city & change would remain plenty!!!
6686 2018-05-12 23:59:49 okayu (rice porridge) - its super easy too, just cook 1/2 cup of rice with 4 cups broth + water til its all mushy and nice. I crack an egg in at the end and cover it so it poaches and top with sesame oil, soy sauce, green onions and sesame seeds
6687 2018-05-12 23:59:27 Koch brothers ,Buffet,Soros all make money off of Canadian oil as longs as it’s not hitting Tide water! Millions every day! Why do you think our politicians sell us out! Off shore accounts , campaign and foundation contributions! They own the media, control it and our government
6688 2018-05-12 23:59:20 We need diff types of petroleum so we need to import. Export what we have that others need. Yes, that’s up a bit. But I want to know why the oil from Iran is cheaper than Russia by about $50. a gallon? Why take higher, when the leader is another tyrant? Summer fam vaca time.

6728 2018-05-12 23:55:37 Who is the one who has been given ISIL from Iraq and Syria to whom it is delivered? It's as clear as the day that the United States is killing this oil and wealth
6729 2018-05-12 23:55:25 Me too! *preps a pan with olive oil and begins chopping some fresh herbs* Dough should be ready, would you mind spreading it into that pan? It doesn't need to be terribly thin.
6730 2018-05-12 23:55:24 And Iran (potentially) have delicious oil to sell. North Korea have nothing. Just a baron country hidden in a mountain range. Great move team Trump, great move.
6731 2018-05-12 23:55:12 $85 for me... and I’m in Oil central Alberta!

6734 2018-05-12 23:54:50 Still. As long as the focus continues on species that need Fish meal / oil in the diets, the principle applies. Sustainable fisheries underpinnings aquaculture’s long term sustainability. They are linked not separated, in my personal opinion.
6735 2018-05-12 23:54:48 I just made a BOMB 3 bean salad that I’m planning on bring to work with me. Just black beans, chick peas kidney beans and hominy and a bunch of chopped up veggies and cilantro . Dump some lime juice and olive oil on it and u done!! I hate cooking n I just did this
6736 2018-05-12 23:54:43 Trumps drama show benefits Putin with financial windfall in spiked oil revenue...nothing to see here..really!
6737 2018-05-12 23:54:39 Because it was their own money of selling theirvown oil that america blocked it illegally
6738 2018-05-12 23:54:34 It is sad you have Trump Haters  Blaming Trump for giving tax brakes to big oil over the past Decade And if that is not enough the blame the Republicans.Hell they have no idea It is just easier to point the finger at Trump
6739 2018-05-12 23:54:21 it’s 2018 and y’all still put coconut oil on your face?? couldn’t be me

6742 2018-05-12 23:53:06 Also, because Im getting mad. No booing in the world will stop Greece voting Cyprus and vice versa. We are sibling states, we share the same language and heritage and there are so many Chypriots in Greece and Greeks in Cyprus.
We are not voting them because of their oil 
6743 2018-05-12 23:52:56 Making some sort of shrimp fried rice thing. Busted out my used fry oil lol
6744 2018-05-12 23:52:49 I remember when gas was .25 cents a gallon and a really cute guy would pump for me and and checked under the hood and check my oil. Those days are gone and how much money do they save by not paying a guy???
6745 2018-05-12 23:52:39 stranger: hablas español
me:y...yes
stranger: que es esto
me: oil para thick and curly hair 

lmao i obviously need to go back to spanish class
6746 2018-05-12 23:52:31 i'm def going to try that- I generally just grill them and add a little olive oil, salt, and pepper. This sounds much more flavorful 
6747 2018-05-12 23:52:12 I dont trust your taste buds bro. Maybe they're not allowed to have the addictive drugs in the dry oil in Utah
6748 2018-05-12 23:52:11 @25_male_nyc Yo pat where you been my man? Cause if you think someone on a oil rig makes more than a dude in nyc I want some of that simple life. Take me away from this shithole

6754 2018-05-12 23:51:38 It’s amazing what you can do with salt, pepper, and olive oil
6755 2018-05-12 23:51:35 I use Shea moisture shampoo conditioner and deep conditioner. And I just started using Jamaican oil & wild growth mix . That’s it
6756 2018-05-12 23:51:33 Is there an essential oil that can make my parents proud of me
6757 2018-05-12 23:51:21 I know 2 people that use cannabis oil and it has changed their lives! From being completely unfuntional to near ful functionality! They both have been of all of the "wonder drugs" the doctors have pushed on them, some making them worse. Ive seen the difference oils DO work!

Moving onto mains, one small medallion of lamb accompanied with a deep fried terrine of more lamb (yes deep fried!!!) leaving you with a taste of oil when all was said and done.

6766 2018-05-12 23:50:14 Will propose some questions to you
1. US refineries are tooled to process what grades of oil? 
2. Can light sweet crude be substituted for heavier grades? If you think yes.. what about API differences? 
3. ARAMCO owns Motiva...largest US refinery.. you think they will sell it?

6775 2018-05-12 23:48:59 @PokerTraditions Sean, I just read your article about Bill Smith WSOP 1985 champion. There was a reason for it.  While getting an oil change today in Albuquerque I struck up a conversation with a lady also getting an oil change.  Next tweet, out of room.
6776 2018-05-12 23:48:50 But the thing is is that it's really not hard not to get that big. Guys love me but I'm not the skinniest girl yet only fitness models would look at me and think I'm overweight. And I only work out when the mood is right. So they have to TRY to get that big.
6777 2018-05-12 23:48:46 Wolves got oil money now lol want every one or isit that super agent

6786 2018-05-12 23:46:53  agree. He was a  that we “oil’d” away and it’s sad. “Home” isn’t always the best place to play.
6787 2018-05-12 23:46:38 And the wars in the middle east, drive up the price of Texas oil. So, who would love for things to escalate there? ...
6788 2018-05-12 23:46:32 Yes. They're awesome. They're the same ones that said we would run out of oil in the year 2000 and that by now overpopulation would cause famine throughout the planet. They were right then too.
I put them in the same boat as the supposed christians calling for end of world
6789 2018-05-12 23:46:19 i think my biggest natural hair find in the past 2 years is that oils aren’t an essential moisturizer (FOR MY HAIR) + oils are a sealant to the moisture your hair has already taken up so if you’re applying oil without moisturizing the oils aren’t even being absorbed properly
6790 2018-05-12 23:46:09 Last week I was listening to Creature Of Habit (My boyfriends EP) while gettin my car oil changed..the mechanic was being all flirty & actin like he’s interested in it..he passd me his phone and was like add your Insta so you can tell me more about this new artist..
6791 2018-05-12 23:46:09 The voters are unhappy that oil royalties have bottomed out and the parties over. You can pretend this is the government or accept reality. Oil revenues have dropped substantially which have resulted in deficits. Unfortunately, you perpetuate falsehoods and blame the NDP.

6793 2018-05-12 23:46:03 If @Iran switch to solar energy and use a hybrid of solar/electric vehicles, the oil consumption in their country will drop exponentially leaving them more to sell.

6797 2018-05-12 23:45:01 How about the stories of Erdogan supporting Daesh, making deals for blackmarket oil and allowing recruits to enter and transit Turkey to join up. Turkey wants Assad gone and replaced with a Turkey friendly Sunni. Oh and all the Kurds dead. That is also high on their list.
6798 2018-05-12 23:44:35 When Trump pulls out of the Iran deal and inadvertently helps Russia by raising the price of oil. Lmao

6800 2018-05-12 23:44:12 2000 years ago my ancestors would have poured hot oil on you and lit it up with a flaming arrow, a long bow the first assault rifle. They're called Armaments not guns. So God gave me that right and God gave you the right to choose to go to hell (which is called free will)

6805 2018-05-12 23:43:27 Across the board, they have increase spending, not just Military (and that has not increased 40%). Not due to nuclear deal but due to increased oil sales.

6809 2018-05-12 23:41:59 By that logic, we shouldn't be funneling tax dollars to the oil industry

6811 2018-05-12 23:41:46 OK Mr. @POTUS it is now time to do something about the inflated oil prices.  STOP SUPPORTING THE GREED OF OPEC.  TAKE CARE OF AMERICANS NOT THE ULTRA RICH SAUIAS

6815 2018-05-12 23:41:27 It seems like everyone want portion of our area, interestingly they always claim the best parts based on made up historical crap. The Zionists wanted the coastal, tourism rich part, and the Kuuuurds want the oil rich one.

6819 2018-05-12 23:40:57 Is no one looking at rising oil prices thanks to Trump pulling out of Iran deal? Is that factored in the budget? #insiders

6827 2018-05-12 23:39:07 Many things are possible but I'll believe the owners of the refinery over a random Twitter user. 

It's not economical to refine bitumen in eastern Canada. The oil companies don't care about "ethical oil"...they care about profit and light US and Saudi oil is more profitable.
6828 2018-05-12 23:38:46 Reading as if taste is same or better than oil, so leaves me to go with the tie breaker, and it's health. But I've read that the oil is so hot that it really isn't unhealthy to cook with it(depending on which oil)
6829 2018-05-12 23:38:19 Just caught up with a buddy of mine from Edmonton who’s a huge Oil fan. We had a couple cold ones and shared some laughs. We also both agree that Peter Chiarelli should go back to practicing law and stay the hell out of sports management.

6847 2018-05-12 23:35:28 Putin wants oil prices to increase to help his ailing economy,  he could be making the Iranians think he will help them if the US attacks them while secretly telling Trump the opposite and thereby encouraging war between them, which will result in oil price increase he needs
6848 2018-05-12 23:35:24 And I'd love to have a couple of Ferraris in my garage, but winters up here suck and the potholes in the summer would swallow them up. (Oh, and I couldn't afford the oil changes.) How about they figure out how to make where they *can* afford to live "cool"?
6849 2018-05-12 23:35:15 Time to shift funding to friends and extent super to countries like Poland, Ukraine etc and shift economic benefits. A Manhattan project to significantly reduce oil cost an$ destroy economies s9ley dependent on oil.

As we grow older, our bodies produce less oil – 60% less at age 65 then at age 18.  This is more pronounced in women, who tend to have drier skin then men.

6862 2018-05-12 23:30:46 Everyone doesn’t know this?  People thought oil was boiling?  Americans, probably.
6863 2018-05-12 23:30:29 I suggest you try a ketogenic diet, with coconut oil instead of butter. You'll feel amazing, and it might cure any problems you have.
6864 2018-05-12 23:30:25 Are any of yall familiar with the sacred krystos oil?
6865 2018-05-12 23:30:15 aka MCT oil. Brain Octane one is coconut tho for sure. Could mix in with any kind of milk/creamer.
6866 2018-05-12 23:30:03 Huh? No time for civics?  Then you have stupid people not wanting illegal immigrants because they don’t follow the law, but they want to incarcerate a person even though she didn’t break the law.  I hope you are not typing while you walk.  That could be dangerous for you 
6867 2018-05-12 23:29:58  am one of those screwed citizens!!! Oil companies and the Alberta Government steal from mineral rights owners and there's nothing the owners can do  because we're not billionaires

6870 2018-05-12 23:29:15 When you drop food into a deep fryer and the oil starts bubbling, it's not boiling—moisture is actually boiling off the surface of the food.
6871 2018-05-12 23:28:42 Did it taste the same as fried in oil?

6874 2018-05-12 23:28:25 There is a direct link from Saudi Arabia oil to 911.  That too is a cost not counted.
6875 2018-05-12 23:28:25 He's right Gore. You're a fraud and you have no business selling your snake oil in OUR COUNTRY.
6876 2018-05-12 23:28:03 Today I changed my oil on my own. Shit was .

6887 2018-05-12 23:26:51 Hey! It’s called “One N Only Aragon Oil” I mixed level 7(medium blonde) and level 9 (very light blonde). I’m pretty sure you can get it at any beauty supply store!

6895 2018-05-12 23:26:00 do you like abstract art?? I was taught how to oil paint years ago doing forest scenery. Sadly I stopped doing the lessons and have never gone back to it.
6896 2018-05-12 23:25:53 mmmm yorkshire puds - one of my favourites. Don't forget to oil your receptacles.
6897 2018-05-12 23:25:50 Explain how letting Iran resume building nuclear weapons, making us pay more for oil, and dividing up NATO with internal fighting helps us. Good luck
6898 2018-05-12 23:25:36 This is on my list too! I have the regular in perfume and body oil, but inexplicably want this intense version as well. It softens during the day into this beautiful sheer veil. 
6899 2018-05-12 23:25:30 Not sure it's just his decision. Iran's oil, Israel and Saudi are some hiding factors now you shouldn't forget.
6900 2018-05-12 23:25:20 Y'all really out there eating oil and cheese
6901 2018-05-12 23:24:57 CBD oil is great and Rick Simpson Oil (RSO) is also VERY helpful in battling cancer. Look up Rick Simpson’s story and I can help you get access to some RSO if she is interested. Just do some research on it.
6902 2018-05-12 23:24:40 Payout is not that great.
Reserves aren’t forever.
If oil goes down the market could decide to use this as an arbitrage.

I like $XOM but it’s so large and integrated it’s a not optimal
6903 2018-05-12 23:24:30 I use baby powder to dry up the oil on the last couple days. I usually wash my hair only like 2 times a week. Your hair gets used to it after a while though and it'll naturally become less greasy as quick :)
6904 2018-05-12 23:24:04 Your clearly confused, the energy east pipeline reduces tanker traffic in the St.lawrence. The oil shipped in to MTL from  Edmonton was going to be Refined and Used in Eastern Canada..
6905 2018-05-12 23:24:02 Job oooooooo. Need to talk to him if he can fix me in one of this oil company. #chikena
6906 2018-05-12 23:23:59 Sprinkle a little salt in your pan if you're frying. This will prevent the oil from splattering.

6912 2018-05-12 23:21:47 @Ocado Here is a puzzle. Tinned Mackerel in Olive Oil - 72p/100g - Ocado price for 125g = 90p. That works. Tesco price for exactly the same thing is 80p/100g. And yet, their price for 125g is 70p. When you check against Tesco prices, do you check the total price or the /g price?

6919 2018-05-12 23:20:41 I used coconut oil after my shower which really helped with the smell. Even though I smelt like a pina colada all day. Then every time I felt it coming back I would rub the oil on my arms as a moisturiser. Might be worth a try xx

6929 2018-05-12 23:18:11 For me this won’t cause some serious blow to the Venezuelans government standing (they export oil + salt where the Russians; Indians (because of discount) & China apparently willing to accept). (Even though they should have seen this coming when they default on their debt).

The sea is more than polluted as it is now.

Bit of oil.Little flame.Sea of fire for that piece of shit.

6950 2018-05-12 23:14:49 didn't use fresh chili either (mainly because you can only seem to buy them in bags of like 7, so 4-5 will go off before I use them again), or ginger. Seasoning the oil first with the powdered ginger & chilli flakes worked a treat.
6951 2018-05-12 23:14:40 You can tax the oil companies to fund the schools. That won't happen if you keep putting their Republican puppets in office.#thisweekinpa
6952 2018-05-12 23:14:39 The only reason we have deficits is because conservatives set up a budget model that relied oil royalties for 25-35 of our revenue. Now that prices have dropped there’s a big hole. If we taxed like every other province, we’d have a surplus. Budgets have two sides. Wake up!

6957 2018-05-12 23:13:51 So what? They started making money from their oil production after the sanctions were lifted. That was part of the deal to sign on to inspection of their nuclear and to only enrich to a set level. Can anyone explain it to you?

6960 2018-05-12 23:13:23 Aside from the extreme oiliness, I'm pleased with how that went.  Even got the portion size perfect, which is unheard of. The quorn is about as good as tofu, though not exactly cheap. Perfect for sucking up the chilli and soy and sesame oil. I am in good cheer. Dancing, even.

6964 2018-05-12 23:12:35 Inventors always need money. They usually finish all their cash in getting as far as they have. It's understandable.

These devices are one-off prototypes of trial & error. Also Big Oil had suppressed the tech as u also know.

6980 2018-05-12 23:09:30 This is why germany attacked poland...because poland had oil and had the first oil wells
6981 2018-05-12 23:09:14 That isn't true. A 16 year study was recently concluded. Pot does too cause brain damage, plus many other ailments. And the greater the use, the greater the damage. And you don't need it for medical reasons; the non-THC oil works just as well. So users need to admit it's a high!

Because france and germany produce tiny amounts of oil...and we know germans love to drive fast...
6995 2018-05-12 23:07:10 Except that Russia did not support higher oil prices in the short term to take over greater market share.  As prices dropped so did shale production but prices did not rise.  Why? The fight over market share.  Pay attention to events

7010 2018-05-12 23:05:06 In your 40's & 50's, ingesting more oils is very important during #Vata kala, says @NancyLonsdorfMD. Add an 2-4 tablespoons of organic, cold-pressed virgin olive oil to the food each day. #Ghee is another good healthy fat to ingest, if your cholesterol levels are healthy.

7012 2018-05-12 23:04:33 That way they can come back a couple years later and do a documentary on the sorry state of the reservations, bemoaning their poverty, and blame the "greedy oil companies" for exploiting the land without sharing the wealth.
7013 2018-05-12 23:04:31 People say that if you cover yourself in oil for 30 minutes all your fake tan will come off... but what are you meant to do for 30 minutes. Not like you can sit down or get in bed? Just stand in the bathroom naked or what 
7014 2018-05-12 23:04:17 I repeat, I do not feel any pity for those who bought the snake oil. No such thing as buyers regret with this.

If they used the oil money there would be nothing left- like in UK.
They started all these policies before oil was discovered, and spend very little of the interest on the oil fund. So when the oil is gone they'll have something left...

7029 2018-05-12 23:01:28 #TenBuckTurnball Saudi Arabia has no income tax because they have oil. We have oil, uranium, gas, coal, gold, bauxite and others and pay one of the worlds highest income tax with the most complex rules an AFL umpire wouldn’t be able to decipher.

7032 2018-05-12 23:01:08 A price change of a few dollars a barrel of oil has a miniscule actual impact on a litre of gas.  But oil companies and gas stations always use it as a reason to increase gas immediately
7033 2018-05-12 23:00:50 Well they have said they gonna do business with Iran. Keep the current deal in place. Just think. Europe starts heaving trading with China and Iran. Then they all use the yen to buy oil instead of the dollar.

7042 2018-05-12 22:59:28 Oops - there goes that little tax break you all got in your paychecks.  The oil barons, corps & refineries could give gas away for free with the billions they raked in from the Republican Tax Heist.

7077 2018-05-12 22:52:36 For many reasons. One part of my business is freight forwarding. We move things around the world both inside and outside of the EU. The other part is oil and gas subsea design. I have no concerns that Brexit will hurt my business.
7078 2018-05-12 22:52:32 and before that I worked in restaurants a ghetto convenience store setting up tables at plantation homes and an oil refinery
7079 2018-05-12 22:52:11 China drinking up world's oil supply prepping to hedge the dollar. March 28 their new currency backed oil future hit the market.

7092 2018-05-12 22:49:30 I wouldn't like that used 15-40 motor oil even if it was free
7093 2018-05-12 22:49:30 Valid point made. I live in California and were being hit much, much higher than any other state.Partly because of our incompetent governor of ours and partly because of the increase in cruel oil.Truth is, America needs to stand on its own resources and less dependency on others.
7094 2018-05-12 22:49:18 Actually, OPEC has reduced their output of oil to increase the price. Remember, oil is a world commodity.  It isn’t specific to the United States.
7095 2018-05-12 22:49:18 THEY SOLD OIL FOR VOTES

Maybe we should stop selling all our assets to the USA (wood oil ,hydro ,gas) and take care of our people first.
7117 2018-05-12 22:44:46 What i can’t figure out is why civic studies is not a required subject in school.  That way we avoid Russia manipulated useful idiots thinking they are patriots #nextconafterTrumpU #PutinPuppet #easyrussianprey
7118 2018-05-12 22:44:10 So we are blaiming the rising gas prices on the rising cost of oil. Why did the prices not come down when the price of oil was low? Sorry folks.... Not buying it

7136 2018-05-12 22:40:19 Mission accomplished, that and $100 for a barrel of oil which will happen with tensions in the Middle East, sanctions against his regime are worthless with high oil prices. Win, win, win
7137 2018-05-12 22:40:11 ああ、これ？スポーツブラ。油の貯蔵庫が垂れちゃうからね。
7138 2018-05-12 22:39:41 Well "#Progressives"+"#Liberals" "#Argue" you shouldn't #Smack #Children because if you #Smacked an adult you'd be arrested for #Assault

And if you picked up an adult+put her down on a bed+stripped her+rubbed baby oil on her nether regions you'd be arrested for #SexualAssault!
7139 2018-05-12 22:39:35 Yep, now it’s unrest in the Middle East and skyrocketing oil prices and you are always right—no other opinion matters.
7140 2018-05-12 22:39:24 looks at oil
looks at america
looks into the camera like im on the damn office
im surprised america hasn't declared war on texas yet have you SEEN the oil fields there
like both are disgusting as hell but uh... boy look at yourselves lol
7141 2018-05-12 22:39:09 Is odd. Similar to justification of slave labor. 
It's beneath the dignity of regular humans, so let's create a subclass to do it
7142 2018-05-12 22:38:52 Just used my new cordless lawn mower. Much quieter than a gas one. No fumes. No oil. No gas runs.
7143 2018-05-12 22:38:50 Put water in the part of his car where he puts oil, out potatoes in the exhaust pipe and key it.. he’ll know you’re just as crazy sis. Thank me. Later x
7144 2018-05-12 22:38:36 guys my bf rubbed cannabis infused coconut oil on my back so i won’t take my pain pills, ugh a fuckin angel
7145 2018-05-12 22:37:55 Coconut oil
7146 2018-05-12 22:37:54 You people do know that we don’t import oil from Iran don’t you?
7147 2018-05-12 22:37:54 psychology? Road rage raises people's level of aggression & the isolation of cars builds disconnect between people

Land? Cars and parking lots consume vast swaths of land (177,602 sq. kms)

Water? The drip of oil underneath the world's cars pollutes oceans 100x more then tankers
7148 2018-05-12 22:37:34 Just a crazy rule. “No payment of $10000 AUD cash was ever legitimate” referring to it as the “black economy” - out of touch and ruled by the banks. Sell me more snake oil you puppets.
7149 2018-05-12 22:37:33 ? Send me a pic. I’m tho king of doing the oil stick to mine soon
7150 2018-05-12 22:37:32 MAD I COULDN’T GET A OIL CHANGE TODAY CUZ .. 
7151 2018-05-12 22:37:13 The root of the word means to smear and the connotation is to smear/anoint for high office. It’s not about trying, it’s about terminology. The term masiah was used as a title for David’s descendants as we would use king. It’s also logical considering they were all anointed w/oil.
7152 2018-05-12 22:37:12 We are the best. Period. Our tech is used all over the world. Fracking, horizontal drilling, deep formations, heavy oil. List goes on. Heck let's add Coal tech while we are at it.
7153 2018-05-12 22:37:10 So, the leaks going to probably need to be fixed but thankfully isn't an immediate issue.  They're saying every 1,000 miles to check my oil and whatnot until I can get it fixed.  My brother and sister in laws baby shower went way better than expected.  Everyone +
7154 2018-05-12 22:37:08 I always complaining when gas raises over 60 cents a gallon in two months time for no reason. No refinery explosion, no tropical storm damage just oil companies ripping us off
7155 2018-05-12 22:36:54 As the owner of a oil company, I appalaud this move. As a non-swamp swimming citizen, I’m confounded. As a Trump supporter, but her emails...
7156 2018-05-12 22:36:37 Rub each and every shirt all over with chapstick. (I spilled a drop of oil on a top once and someone told me to soak it in oil so that it matches.)
7157 2018-05-12 22:36:29 @NewshubNationNZ Stopping future Oil Exploration in & around is Stupid as need Fuel to Move & Farm ! Marsden Point Should be Processing Oil

7159 2018-05-12 22:36:15 And then the CIA toppled their democratically elected government in order to get access to their oil.
7160 2018-05-12 22:35:59 Pass me the oil
7161 2018-05-12 22:35:12 God help us.
7162 2018-05-12 22:35:11 Saliva would accumulate doubling the oil size 3 times till your jaw hurts
7163 2018-05-12 22:35:10 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
7164 2018-05-12 22:34:53 Water based ( most spray paints ) - dish soap and elbow grease. Scrub scrub scrub

Oil based - wd 40 or hairspray
7165 2018-05-12 22:34:47 They're liken to a snake oil saleman. Because they have nothing of use to offer they can only baffle voters with fake Liberal scandals. What they would actually do is mimic Trump's policies. Scheer would be worse then Harper.
7166 2018-05-12 22:34:45 Guyanese coconut oil and everything else in we DNA 
7167 2018-05-12 22:34:41 doing a coconut oil hair mask bc it’s 500% necessary but it’s really a serious hassle 
7168 2018-05-12 22:34:16 Green energy is the only future for Puerto Rico. The powers that be are sabotaging the movement in order to continue to capitalize on their dependence on oil.
7169 2018-05-12 22:34:08 Don't you know EVERYTHING is bad for you except love and light, literally. Oh and greens, and good oil and water xxxx
7170 2018-05-12 22:34:07 Ngl despite the consumption implication ofc about the expense on gas. It’s still not at $250 a barrel. I’ll offset with investments on 3xleveraged oil ETFs and use the gains for monthly gas consumption which is about 3 to 400 hundred.
7171 2018-05-12 22:34:02 Wow my bad i forgot that they didn’t actually bomb hospitals full of sick children for money and oil it was for freedom all along xoxo
7172 2018-05-12 22:33:51 i layed in the sun today from 2-5:30pm... not even red wtf i used baby oil...
7173 2018-05-12 22:33:35 Have you ever had chili oil? A spoon full will certainly wake you up...! Or knock you down.
7174 2018-05-12 22:33:35 Tanning oil, sunshine, aloe Vera, At the Beach lotion, wet hair... all I need is Al’s Pizza and Rita’s Italian Ice, and I’m basically at Jax Beach.

Because we all know better than to go to the actual beach there. 

In other news, I miss Little Talbot Island.
7175 2018-05-12 22:33:27 Just pour a bottle of coconut oil on your face and wipe with disposable towel or wipes ,sharp way to teach tiredness who's boss
7176 2018-05-12 22:32:57 We will need it thanks to the instability in the Middle East, oil prices rise, gas prices rise all thanks to the foreign policy of @realDonaldTrump
7177 2018-05-12 22:32:48 I thought Knute came off somewhat aloof and the politician sound bites rolled off his tongue with a little too much oil. 

You said you thought Knute did poorly, care to share specifics?
7178 2018-05-12 22:32:46 There’s probably an essential oil for that.
7179 2018-05-12 22:32:43 Hot green tea helps me, or CBD oil!
7180 2018-05-12 22:32:42 Coconut oil will have ya body glistening 
7181 2018-05-12 22:32:30 I'm not pinning my hopes for goodness on him but he's the best example from that level of you can do right by other people. At all. Oil companies get huge amounts of corporate welfare, turn huge profits, and hire and fire at their whim to create and control demand.
7182 2018-05-12 22:32:20 A great olive oil is one of the best things on earth
7183 2018-05-12 22:31:52 Strange how dems defend using the labor of illegals for doing jobs beneath the dignity of regular ppl/citizens.
7184 2018-05-12 22:31:45 After I shave I oil my whole body down with coconut oil, then put some lotion on top of it. My skin be so smooth 
7185 2018-05-12 22:31:17 Alex Hill and Sam Hafertepe Jr. are ready to go tonight with The Lucas Oil ASCSNational Tour tonight at I-30 Speedway
7186 2018-05-12 22:31:01 Fried in what? Butter? Oil?
7187 2018-05-12 22:31:00 My first olive oil tasting. Life changing.
7188 2018-05-12 22:30:49 This is just incorrect and extremely ignorant.   The western Canadian sedimentary basin produces some of the finest crude oil on the planet.   And it does so to standards matched by none !!
7189 2018-05-12 22:30:42 @SAU_JonH  This is a very tasty and plain dish of beef mixed with salt, pepper, and olive oil and cooked on a grill.

7193 2018-05-12 22:30:18 Lol oh noooo . And yeah canola or veggie oil is good . And yeah like 1-2 mins . You want it lightly fried
7194 2018-05-12 22:30:02 sorry voor deze ik maak voor mij zelf hemp oil en rook graag een lekkere blow!
7195 2018-05-12 22:29:55 Water or oil based paint?
7196 2018-05-12 22:29:43 Productive Saturday  oil change, packing, cleaning
7197 2018-05-12 22:29:32 ooo ok, I’ve used vegan butter to make real good veggies before but some vegan butter brands still have some percentage of oil. I’d say try to steam them and season them (try pink rock salt on fresh uncooked tomato with some vinegar it’s fucking GR8T)
7198 2018-05-12 22:29:26 Hey, one of my friends has lymphoma, do you have anything I can read up on/any advice you have that I can give him? He’s tried CBD oil to no avail (I believe it’s the THC that helps in it maybe but that’s the illegal part here). What’s this acidic/alkaline diet thing?
7199 2018-05-12 22:29:13 It came with trade deals on oil, Russia has nukes and are a bigger threat but you dont care he won't enforce the sanctions he is supposed too..
7200 2018-05-12 22:28:36 Ooooo, I was gonna leave the peel on. Got it. Hahaha. But word. Thanks. Canola oil good? Also a lil as in a minute or 3 minutes? 
7201 2018-05-12 22:28:22 Bloody Austria. He was standing on an oil rig - that's all I can remember. Now he's in the lead??? #Eurovision
7202 2018-05-12 22:28:13 Kim JU is playing Chump like a fiddle & he's dancing to the tune, cutting off Iran's oil so Russia makes out.. it's all theatre.
7203 2018-05-12 22:28:06 Mi estimado Sergio, he trabajado en el sector de oil@gas por muchos años, el incremento en el precio de la gas no obedece a la reforma sino a los impuestos especiales con que tasa el gobierno, la reforma por el contrario ha traído inversionistas
7204 2018-05-12 22:27:12 UK in danger of getting relegated. Next year we'll send Robbie Williams to compete against Liechtenstein, Gibraltar, Greenland and a North Sea Oil Rig #Eurovision
7205 2018-05-12 22:26:52 Glucosamine, yumove, metacam, cod liver oil, and tumeric all seem to be popular choices with the dogs I’ve seen (I work in a boarding kennels and see a lot of dogs), tumeric can make your dog gassy so watch out for that 
7206 2018-05-12 22:26:31 Next he will be buying Russian Oil.

7208 2018-05-12 22:26:07 Precisely. In my view the (subtle) process of shifting the bid to Shanghai has begun. China is declining Saudi pricing & US sanctions will see the bid fall for Iran oil. As for OPEC it's not a matter of IF they cheat but how: China SPR build made demand seem higher than it was
7209 2018-05-12 22:25:48 ANY CANADIANS WANTING TO ORDER CBD OIL .. PLEASE CONTACT ME

7212 2018-05-12 22:25:18 To establish a tougher economic sanction on #Iran, #Obama admin. had pressed on #India NOT to buy #Iran's #Oil. But, #India had refused back then by stating that it was a matter of their #NationalSecurity & continued on buying #Iranian #Oil in exchange of #Gold, #Cash & #Goods.
7213 2018-05-12 22:25:02 Speaking of dirty money.  Have you seen your FEC donation data? Oil Co's, Healthcare Co's, Insurance Co's.  Clearly, you've never met a PAC you didn't like.  If you and Republican @DevinNunes discussed campaign donors rather than Russia you'd find you have many donors in common!!
7214 2018-05-12 22:25:00 @MassSave  Is it possible to get a rebate for switching my really old oil-fired water heater to An air-source heat pump water heater?  You do have rebates for new oil, or heatpump wter heaters that replace electric.

7216 2018-05-12 22:24:41 Beard care time:

- Clean and exfoliate whole face
- Argan oil (beard and head) combed into the beard with a boar bristle brush, in a downward motion (to "train" the beard to grow uniformly in the same direction). Let it on overnight.
7217 2018-05-12 22:24:33 We're hoping to use an old heating oil tank. There's a guy local to us who cleans and decontaminates them and Christian at the farm has used them before for sheep field shelters.
But thanks for the link!
7218 2018-05-12 22:24:22 But who benefits from higher oil/gas prices? Trump and his buddy Putin. Why would Trump care?
7219 2018-05-12 22:24:15 You do know that American oil producers own global production facilities, right? Fracking is simple but doesn't pay them as well as jacking prices for the risk oil
7220 2018-05-12 22:24:09 However, the oil futures price has been steadily rising for months now. That will have to flow to the pump price.

7224 2018-05-12 22:23:45 Nasser follows up by instituting a naval blockade of Israel’s southern port (incidentally the one that serves Israel oil import), Nasser further follows up by kicking out the U.N. peacekeeping forces...
7225 2018-05-12 22:23:44 It has a dirty secrets.  It’s not what it seems. Pension problem. Big oil business. Big arms weapons manufacturer.

7228 2018-05-12 22:22:40 I know what I'll do!

... wash dishes and then wait for them to dry so I can work on a surface that's not covered in fish oil.
7229 2018-05-12 22:22:35 JCPOA signed by Obama and P5+1 lightened sanction for Iran to sell oil but at the same time forced regime to buy unnecessary branded European cars with difficult engines not compatible with eastern weather. Deal to cajole Iran drop inventing atomic bomb seeing Israel as enemy.
7230 2018-05-12 22:22:28 Mix vitamin E oil and cocoa butter and apply it to the area morning and night.
7231 2018-05-12 22:22:21 Tell the people who love Karl Marx that his ideas make people so poor they starve to death...in a country with huge oil reserves, they are so poor, they starve to death....
7232 2018-05-12 22:21:32 So the 5 countries are all lying? Do they know you think they're all stupid? What's your Plan B  when all hell breaks loose, blame Obama?   I'm sure Putin thanks you for doing it, he's going to make big bucks from rising oil prices. That your payback to him for the sanctions?

7242 2018-05-12 22:19:42 Good grief!!!!! Neither one of them really gets it. Hillary is a criminal. Illegals are breaking the law. Obama was a snake oil salesman. Corruption is rampant. Republicans don't fight back. Trump does. And he's doing a great job.
7243 2018-05-12 22:19:35 Are these students taking proper degrees at proper unis? Who are intelligent enough not to believe Snake oil salesman Corbyns pie in the sky promises? I guess not.. Bore off .
7244 2018-05-12 22:19:31 That baby oil thing to get tan off did not work on me at all.

7252 2018-05-12 22:18:41 You just shot up the cost of gas an oil Donny. I really hope Mueller brings you down.
7253 2018-05-12 22:18:30 It’s time for Linus to get his first oil change 
7254 2018-05-12 22:18:27 Sadly,  palm oil is in half of packaged products at the grocery store. While cheap to produce, the cost to the environment is astronomcal.
Read that the best food has the least number of ingredients. Obviously, avoiding packaged foods is the easiest way to avoid #PalmOil #vegan
7255 2018-05-12 22:18:15 Yeah, that's it! Not the spike in oil or the budget-busting wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after Bush cut top tax rates. It was all Bill Clinton ... You're a genius!

7259 2018-05-12 22:17:54 Gotta ask people if they notice the oil companies took whatever the 2017 Tax RAPE gave them, and then some, courtesy of the shortsighted Obama hater.

.....while rich folk and corporations are buying back their stock and stashing the difference in Panama/Cayman/Swiss accounts.
7260 2018-05-12 22:17:43 Why I can't figure out why #crookedhillary is still free.
7261 2018-05-12 22:17:40 I must have done something so good in a past life to have been blessed with primarks oil infused micellar water and makeup revolutions baking oil  my skin has never been so soft  can’t reccomend enough
7262 2018-05-12 22:17:25 Later I found out that it contained fish oil. My colleagues said they didn’t want to ruin it for me so they just told me it was vegan 
7263 2018-05-12 22:17:25 @Kimzolciak    I love Kashmere day and night oil! Have you thought about making them bigger? Also , do you employee reps in the Michigan area—-more people would know about your products! Contact me I am interested! Jacki
7264 2018-05-12 22:16:46 It’s only gonna go harder that way, as other countries move away from oil and the oil-backed currency country fades further into irrelevance. :V
7265 2018-05-12 22:16:42 They are gonna have to move on from Morales I think. J.D will be the DH I am guessing especially if it is a wasted season
7266 2018-05-12 22:16:39 Did you miss the fact that we have given everything to process tar sands in the SE? Any moral society would be decades past oil by now
7267 2018-05-12 22:16:31 Washington post "brainwashing".Bush Is a criminal who sended his army destroying Iraq for oil.
7268 2018-05-12 22:16:31 Seems like the RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS, Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and OIL companies are the only beneficiaries of TRUMP'S AMERICA!!
7269 2018-05-12 22:16:29 Iraq would not have happened without the Cheney-led  oil conspiracy.
7270 2018-05-12 22:16:24 Eurovison Is never about the singing....has not been for years. It' a political platform for which country hates each other.

7271 2018-05-12 22:16:10 @lonestarcollege Some of the professors at Lone star hate fossil fuels. Oil families cancel your funding and leave your money to @Texas A&M. @ALLewandowski3 complete greenie
7272 2018-05-12 22:15:58 The guy changing my oil was another headbanger 
7273 2018-05-12 22:15:52 How many types of Olive oil does he need? 

How irresponsible and racist is he to promote white sugar? 
Is he ignorant of people suffering from diabetes and/or obesity?
7274 2018-05-12 22:15:50 Apparently he sent this hipster guy on his way.

Was sick of hearing about his vegan lifestyle and beard oil.
7275 2018-05-12 22:15:46 Whip together 1/3 cup cayenne pepper with 2 tablespoons eel sushi. Mix into  Olive Oil. Drain through cheesecloth Serve to your worst enemy.

Chicken
Steak
Potatoes
Water
Yogurt
Nuts
Fruit
Spinach
Mushroooms
Bell peppers
Peanut oil, avocado oil

You can mainly find these on the outer perimeter of grocery stores, which is ideal.
7277 2018-05-12 22:15:24 My understanding was they went on a guided tour with the lead commissioner from the missing women's inquiry. This is comparable to Jane Fonda touring the oil sands with green peace. Absolutely no credibility
7278 2018-05-12 22:14:35 Norway: fuck you (oil)money
7279 2018-05-12 22:14:33 If we charged the Coal and Oil companies to cleanup the garbage their products dump in the air there would be no money to be made by digging dead plants and dinosaur cooked remains for energy
7280 2018-05-12 22:14:32 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
7281 2018-05-12 22:14:32 Which is what oil companies, Saudis and Israel want
7282 2018-05-12 22:14:16 So even as oil goes to $100 a barrel, the world will ramp up production and Trump will continue killing clean energy to balance the cost in the higher figures

7284 2018-05-12 22:14:08 I have finally learned to put moisturiser over face oil and I feel like a babby
7285 2018-05-12 22:14:05 I have successfully worn out the munchkin. Mother’s Day flower craft @jcpenney, gym, home for lunch, essential oil body scrub and room spray workshop at the natural grocery store, and the mall playground. We both need a nap!

7288 2018-05-12 22:13:52 10 points! Thank you Norway. We won’t invade you and steal your oil this year #eurovision
7289 2018-05-12 22:13:43 Are you going to talk about no more cars, transports & planes? Also are you going to talk about no more plastics & electronics. Lots of medical innovations also use oil byproducts, are these on the list too?
7290 2018-05-12 22:13:41 Like oil? You'll love churches!
7291 2018-05-12 22:13:26 I thought oil changes were free. Never been charged for one
7292 2018-05-12 22:13:19 Iran was complying. Secondary sanctions on international businesses (our allies) purchasing oil from Iran are getting screwed in yet another slap in the face to those who back us up when we need to bomb someone.
7293 2018-05-12 22:13:02 Depending on why you wanna cut oil, not all oil is bad; olive oil is healthy and not a problem  but vegan butter will also give u really well cooked veggies. Or u can use a rice cooker to steam them and then just have a good dip and season em real good 
7294 2018-05-12 22:13:00 They could give a shi less about the American oil worker...tech has already reduced their numbers
7295 2018-05-12 22:12:42 @Shahidmasooddr where are you and when are you coming back to your talk show live with Dr shahid masood. Regards Farrukh and EX. Director Oil and Gas Petrofac international UAE/UK.
7296 2018-05-12 22:12:28 The best is re-seasoned cast iron skillet. You did use virgin olive oil, right?
7297 2018-05-12 22:12:18 Ummm...Trump has people who work with Canadian and Russian oil and know that cutting roduction will raise prices per barrel. Russia and SA just proved this. Industry will gladly back off production to keep prices right at a line for tar sands and Arctic driling
7298 2018-05-12 22:12:17 J ai entendue dire que bi oil est cancérigène et contient un produit toxique donc fait attention quand même
7299 2018-05-12 22:11:59 The oil cistern is the gun on the mantle #mother
7300 2018-05-12 22:11:28 If ya man can’t change his own oil then wtf 
7301 2018-05-12 22:11:27 Precisely, which the Arsenal did, unbeaten, when you were playing catch up with the bottom half of the league and scraping wins to survive, until barrels of oil money came calling. What’s your point, now?
7302 2018-05-12 22:10:59 Ok but why do boys stare at me when I change the oil in my car as if it’s not the easiest thing to fucking do?? I don’t need whistles of encouragement either.
7303 2018-05-12 22:10:55 I went to an essential oil workshop today. My new favorite scent: lemon myrtle. 
7304 2018-05-12 22:10:46 Just wait till Pompeo gets done squeezing the countries doing business with Iran. Then When the  Saudis start pumping more oil to lower the price its gonna get nasty.

7310 2018-05-12 22:10:02 Well this was in Oklahoma. Maybe you’re not supposed to drink the water for all the oil in it
7311 2018-05-12 22:09:52 i put the laura on my whole face for oil control in the t zone & moisture everywhere else cus i get dry, let that sink in for a few mins so they don't mix, then put the ysl wherever my pores are big & any areas w too much texture
7312 2018-05-12 22:09:40 I don't feel like I owe an apology but I will say I am sorry.

When someone accuses the team and myself of being snake oil salesmen (quoted definition – "a snake oil salesman is commonly used in English to describe a quack..."), well I just don't take kindly to that disrespect.
7313 2018-05-12 22:09:38 They bribed with oil obviously
7314 2018-05-12 22:09:34 Try guna safi men dulu nk hilang kan minyak cari safi men hok untuk oil watson ada. Pastu dei kulit xminyak dah cari nivea hok utk nivea men hok utk normal skin beli jugok torner dia dengan serum. Istiqamah ah pakai kalau dalam sebulan dok jadi tu tando takdok effect.
7315 2018-05-12 22:09:07 If you just care to share what Canadians are doing with that oil invested soil after getting the oil out. Recreation of nature at an enormous scale. What climate crisis? You personally invented this BS! 20ft sea level rise and you bought property right on the beach! What a joke!!
7316 2018-05-12 22:08:58 Eastern Europe too today too no interest to give free 10 billion euros to usa's middle east oils exports too, usa's oil exports too, usa's united nations too, 
usa's carribean bankers too, usa's bankers too, usa's Monaco banks too,
7317 2018-05-12 22:08:47 I’m literally standing naked covered in baby oil in my room alone hoping it’ll take my tan off
7318 2018-05-12 22:08:45 Croatia is a notable producer of organic foodsand much of it is exported to the European Union. Croatian wines, olive oil and lavenderare particularly sought after.
7319 2018-05-12 22:08:44 ん？何か言ったかい？w
7320 2018-05-12 22:08:42 We have one of the largest untapped oil reservoirs in the entire world right here in the US. We don't NEED anyone. Well use up everyone else's before we touch ours. Plus, the tech we have don't rely on oil to run. Let them eat cake....lol. We're gonna friends with Russia soon.
7321 2018-05-12 22:08:40 Ummm, trump has very limited power over how much oil is produced. Unlike large foreign nationalized producers, America has many private sector E&P companies who drill base on general market conditions and demand.
7322 2018-05-12 22:08:07 ゆーさんクリアおめでとう
みんなでやると楽しいね。
都合ついたら、またギミック説明しながらやりたいね
7323 2018-05-12 22:08:06 It was always about the price of oil, which was a bigger hurdle for Iran than sanctions ever were.
7324 2018-05-12 22:07:52 Increase in cost of living? Oil tariffs etc. hypocrit

7326 2018-05-12 22:07:46 Don't shout at me, Joshua. Your feed is full of attacks on enviro groups, contradictory statements about CC (caused by unfettered access to cheap energy, yet wow! let's use oil & gas to create more electricity), telling details like photos of you & Chris Bishop. Your bias shows.
7327 2018-05-12 22:07:36 Don't forget war started under false pretenses for oil

7329 2018-05-12 22:06:52 I learned that if you are making an all coconut oil soap, you have to super fat it 20 to 33%. My wife is amazing in how and what she creates. I love her very much.
7330 2018-05-12 22:06:42 Yes I have been making time to create as a form of self care through this time too.  Oil painting works for me.

7340 2018-05-12 22:05:01 America is about to meddle with Venezuela...could it be once again so they can keep driving their 5L yank tanks rather than use this time (whilst the oil still flows) wisely by looking into alternatives. Venezuela boasts the world's single largest Oil reserve.

7345 2018-05-12 22:03:23 If they're pro-charges, they're pro-privatisation down the line. Water is an increasingly valuable commodity and like our oil, our gombeens want to sell to the lowest bidder.

7352 2018-05-12 22:02:30 Now's the time for oil/ gas stocks getting ready for summer...buying calls..stay close to strike. 60 days out...
7353 2018-05-12 22:02:27 But yeh last year itna acha nahi . Due to political instability n increase in the crude oil price .
7354 2018-05-12 22:02:26 Most of that stuff is really good. But I'm not sure about the energy independence. OPEC still seems to be able to spike oil prices and it's starting to eat away at our tax cut windfall. I don't know why this is.
7355 2018-05-12 22:02:18 Oh mate..... this is only too real for me, I’ve just lived 20 months of my best friend and Operations Manager, who was diagnosed with PC. He was given 6-8mths tops, but we fed him oil constantly, he had a further 12 months relatively pain free, they didn’t offer chemo
7356 2018-05-12 22:02:14 ويسعد قلبك يارب 
7357 2018-05-12 22:02:11 I wonder how great it will feel this summer when we fill up at the pump? Trump didn’t like low gas prices and Iran selling their oil  Now he and his buddies and swamp cabinet will make $$$  from high gas prices and BIGLY tax cuts! Such a con job

7362 2018-05-12 22:01:19 She should not be allowed to use the word credibility. It’s like mixing oil and water.

7365 2018-05-12 22:00:54 Oh boy, I live for post like this.  Name one company that is leaving the US due to Trump policies.  In fact jobs are coming back.  Oil prices are up bc the global economy is booming which means more oil usage and therefore higher prices.  It's not complicated.

7382 2018-05-12 21:56:34 Ummmm......Medical grade CBD oil has THC removed so doesn’t show up in tests. Unless you are ingesting 100 times recommended dose.
7383 2018-05-12 21:56:33 ..resurrected, and really was the Son of God, then that changes everything you thought was real! A bit like the Matrix, to use a crude popular culture analogy
7384 2018-05-12 21:56:22 Jodie Mitchell......Just letting you know i got a few bits in tesco after work. Got some oil and some eggs and more bread. Also got you some pepperamis and more milk as you were running low ok.
7385 2018-05-12 21:56:21 Well here we go, two snake oil salesmen. Chances are neither one of them has any intention of following through on the deal.
7386 2018-05-12 21:55:59 Why do many white Americans have their heads in their asses? U wrongfully attacked Iraq, killed a million civilians, destroyed infrastructure, livelihoods, communities, ancient buildings, stole their oil, gold reserves, ancient artifacts but a small election is all u got to show?
7387 2018-05-12 21:55:46 Thus making all his newly found oil buddies so happy! And Jared got that loan he was after too...!

7390 2018-05-12 21:55:03 ...Jesus Christ, dying and rising again, science proves it happened. But then, what do you do with that evidence? Often people shy away from going near anything to do with Christianity, because they instinctually know, if Jesus really did live, really did die, and really was..
7391 2018-05-12 21:55:03 Ask Jason. He was an MP when oil prices were through the roof and no pipelines got built.

7403 2018-05-12 21:52:18 'Just saying' nothing in pseudo riddles. We don't need polished, snake oil, used car salesmen type politicians. Personally I prefer honest, rough around the edges politicians. You come across as some1 who prefers style over substance, very shallow. But it's yr choice 2 be shallow

7413 2018-05-12 21:50:05 This gouging in the summer has been going on for years. Oil companies always have a different excuse but the bottom line is they do it because they can

7415 2018-05-12 21:50:00 These grown ass people using detergent to clean their food man. Then there was that old American lady who was marinating chicken in motor oil. Focken madness
7416 2018-05-12 21:49:29 Russia has tech that no one has also. U need to understand how things work. When half the oil is shut off, kinda affects the whole world. Without commerce, US cant afford military. Get it? Iran could stop that much oil...
7417 2018-05-12 21:49:23 Just like the leadership for the flickers I guess.... Both not playing for Stanley....   Oil will be back in the playoffs next year, flames highly unlikely..... Id take Mcd over Mr Bean any day

7419 2018-05-12 21:49:10 So at what price does oil have to be for a pipeline to be built?
7420 2018-05-12 21:49:07 In the best years of high oil price our tax revenue contributes more than the fiscal gap. Sadly for 90% of the time we are subsidised.

If you must revert to an economic case for leaving the UK you fall far short of the truth.
7421 2018-05-12 21:49:00 Oil production is not going to stop any time soon.  Stopping the pipeline is only going to increase costs and stop investment in Canada. Is that your mandate?
7422 2018-05-12 21:48:52 寝てないんだよ(？
7423 2018-05-12 21:48:50 Whereas older people invariably vote after soul searching hours of intellectual rigour, and are never swayed by screaming headlines and populist snake oil salesmen, eh?
7424 2018-05-12 21:48:46 CBD Oil, it’ll change your sleeping habits for the better! 
7425 2018-05-12 21:48:34 My sister snuck out with my niece to see @bammybestowed without me and I've been angry all day. The annoying yet amusing part is they took pictures and bought bam oil which I've been staring at all day.

7426 2018-05-12 21:48:34 Bertolak jam 11.40pm.. N the oil runs out kat petrol station like wtf?!!! Seb baek ada satu yg still ada mnyak...
7427 2018-05-12 21:48:30 Other oil based lubricants are available
7428 2018-05-12 21:48:30 So by supporting them, you mean denying them new jobs in rising industries that are being recognized globally, while oil and coal whithers away? You're delusional to think that oil and coal are the only industries ready to provide jobs. Market demand is moving to RENEWABLES
7429 2018-05-12 21:48:23 Getting fake tan off using baby oil is all fun and games until you’re slipping around the shower like an overweight seal 
7430 2018-05-12 21:47:36 No, you are mostly wrong. Anyone who was believed to be here to do Gods work was anointed (with oil). This included priests, prophets, and kings (David comes to mind). It doesn’t mean “king”. It means anointed to do Gods work here on earth. Nice try though

7434 2018-05-12 21:47:17 How else are you going to dump the oil and tacks on the tailing cars?
7435 2018-05-12 21:47:14 The simple answer is that the chemical properties of oil and water result in them having smaller coefficients of friction than other surfaces like concrete.
7436 2018-05-12 21:47:09 Don't know why I put baby oil gel on before I came out to this field

7488 2018-05-12 21:39:24 Yes as long as they are truely pure. The FDA only requires a single drop of oil and the rest can be anything. Purchase your oils from companies that give you test results of their oils purity. Doterra and YL are two of them. Doterra lists internal directions.

7509 2018-05-12 21:34:37 It's good for them! It's not one or the other, 'Science' or 'god', 'big bang' or 'creation'. That is thinking about it in an ideas way only. But the actual truth, actually how did the earth come in to being? Science can explain as far back as the big bang. But it can't tell us..
7510 2018-05-12 21:34:11 they probably had some pure oil for that exact purpose, especially if theyre living in sub saharan africa
7511 2018-05-12 21:34:01 Republican voters fail to realize that when America goes on wars for oil the oil companies get rich not Americans. Americans pay for the war and the trickle down effect doesn’t pay what Americans paid for the war.

7524 2018-05-12 21:31:56 Really, less jobs have been created under Trump than Obama. Wage growth has slowed, healthcare is more expansive, oil is going up, housing has slowed, plants have left to go elsewhere....but yeah millionaires got a tax break. 
7525 2018-05-12 21:31:27 Key word: cheap oil.

The end users were used car purchasers that were rightfully pissed things like leaking oil cooler lines weren't replaced while dog chewed door pulls were. It was a fight before the things hit the lot so passing the buck was a conscious decision.

7537 2018-05-12 21:29:58 No to saute. Will add oil which will affect overall texture of quac. Fire-roasting the peppers is a better idea.

7539 2018-05-12 21:29:47 LOL!   Going back and forth between indica and sativa oil.  Sitting for twenty minutes, then go grocery shopping.  Then sit for twenty minutes, and do all the laundry, clean the cat box, and build the new cat box.  Then sit, ad infinitum  
7540 2018-05-12 21:29:32 Who called it Baby Oil and not A Massage In A Bottle?
7541 2018-05-12 21:29:29 mostly about OIL though from what I read. They have other avenues for the kids. I want them all locked up for whatever we can get them on. FOR LIFE.
7542 2018-05-12 21:29:03 Apart from info on wmd's so we go to war a murder thousands for oil.

7545 2018-05-12 21:28:47 Regardless of source, the price of gasoline usually rises and falls depending on the price of oil on the worldwide market.
7546 2018-05-12 21:28:41 @Tesla #Model3 is cheaper & stylish to own than a @Honda #Accord after 90k miles w/current gas prices.  Assume ~30mpg, 2k in maintenance 7.5k is gas cost & 28k base price.  37.5k total for the @Honda. 35k base for #Model3 & 2.5k in electricity. This will break the oil/car market.
7547 2018-05-12 21:28:23 I buy my coconut oil
7548 2018-05-12 21:28:06 same thing happened to me on a plane with a bottle of CBD oil
7549 2018-05-12 21:27:55 I have been thinking about your oil chart - the timing of oil's rises would imply long oil has some dominant characteristics to other late cycle trades, for example, some rate trades.

7552 2018-05-12 21:27:40 Our energy policy is so naive.The Americans under Obama(the only pipeline he ever opposed was Keystone) and Trump have surged ahead on oil and gas production.Our leaders have been  conned by the American funded activists and the Gore, Suzucki, Trudeau-Butts types.Wake up Canada.
7553 2018-05-12 21:27:36 I'm aware much more needs to be done! I live in the Hi Desert & we have dairies & Oil & I know What These things can do to our air quality however, because of CA regs it's surprising gotten better! Seriously,  send a letter to Trump about your concerns He'll respond! Do it!!
7554 2018-05-12 21:27:25 The @Irandeal had worked for the past 3 yesrs at no cost to the @US, so why would @Trump would want to tear it up, even though the  @American people will be paying for it in terms of higher oil prices, the answer is one word @Israel who is running this whitehoudlse!
7555 2018-05-12 21:27:25 I'm getting an oil change and my tires changed(???) I think. I dont know what im doing with them but I had a flat tire earlier sooooo yay
7556 2018-05-12 21:27:19 this is the Earths payback for the super rich drilling for oil an being so greedy about it
7557 2018-05-12 21:27:15 Subham!! fro positional have a look at OIL india!! needed I can share my finding!!
7558 2018-05-12 21:27:13 I just got olive oil into my eyes (dont ask how) and ive never felt more arab
7559 2018-05-12 21:27:13 You must know that their numbers for employment don’t match direct and indirect investment and job numbers in oil & gas right???
7560 2018-05-12 21:27:12 He is a Snake oil salesman
7561 2018-05-12 21:27:05 I would use a apple cider vinegar recipe for a toner and coconut oil mask recipe at night-during the day I like puracy lotion free of most chemicals. What you eat matters the most thou when it comes to wrinkles and sun coverage:)
7562 2018-05-12 21:27:02 love putting coconut oil on my skin after a shower, i smell like freska
7563 2018-05-12 21:27:02 mixing coconut oil & lotion>>>
7564 2018-05-12 21:26:39 Probably and there is oil too in the store but too much work. Dispenser se pani garam karti hun insanon ki tarhan
7565 2018-05-12 21:26:37 India imports more Iranian oil than any other country. Not in Iran agreement that Weaselly just tore up.
7566 2018-05-12 21:26:36 An estimated 175 Americans will die today because of opioids... not one person will die from Hemp CBD oil.
7567 2018-05-12 21:26:31 It's sad when it takes longer to replace one HID bulb than completing an oil change.
7568 2018-05-12 21:26:23 Probably not, because it won’t dry up until we take the same steps as Europe and wean ourselves off oil.
As long as we fossil fuels to power the Transportation system and the Power Grid, we will be entangled with Middle East assholes and their politics.
7569 2018-05-12 21:25:58 Is there OIL in NK?
7570 2018-05-12 21:25:58 Wet hankie, what was I thinking? These days kids have it easier & it would be a jojoba oil wet wipe.

Whereas when I was a kid if was my mother's spit & I wouldn't mind but her breath was deadly. I was probably sent to school with a new strain of bacteria on my face every day! 
7571 2018-05-12 21:25:55 Well leave the oil before you defect!
7572 2018-05-12 21:25:02 “School choice is corporate because we spend public money to big oil to fuel busses that transport kids to the schools of their choice.” - a real argument made by an elected at today’s #MplsCityConvention. Isn’t this just an argument against busses?
7573 2018-05-12 21:24:58 Going to sleep with tea trea oil on my face and Zambuk on my lips. Just preparing my face for tomorrow’s beat 
7574 2018-05-12 21:24:56 I will need ram stick dipped in oil  after trying this, i will find you and take away your DDR4 ram!
7575 2018-05-12 21:24:47 I always fry asparagus...touch of olive oil; butter; and garlic!
7576 2018-05-12 21:24:47 I’m an @theSNP member. The second they buy into any snake oil a divisive charlatan like you spouts David is the second I cut up my membership card. You aren’t the voice of reason here, you’re a big part of the problem.

7578 2018-05-12 21:24:38 Assuming you’re using synthetic oil that would be factory recommendation
7579 2018-05-12 21:23:55 Trying to find CBD/hemp oil in West Texas to give my dog to help with his pain...
7580 2018-05-12 21:23:39 Oil in the gas most likely
7581 2018-05-12 21:23:36 It’s obvious that the amount of risk associated with oil and gas exploration has escaped your keen attention.   The oil and gas companies are the last to whine.   They innovate & improve & increase efficiencies so that you have cheap clean energy for the many comforts you enjoy.
7582 2018-05-12 21:23:01 Pity he did not eat two dozen oil barons, followed by some politicians with some racists for dessert.
7583 2018-05-12 21:23:00 Olive oil and grapeseed oil have antioxidants that will help remove lotion. It will also help prevent breakouts.
7584 2018-05-12 21:22:56 Sexton definatly pours he's old engine oil down the drain
7585 2018-05-12 21:22:53 Taxes and royalties on oil sent by oil tanker through Metro Vancouver, one of North America’s most densely populated cities? With much more flammable substance than Lac-Mégantic? We’re spending 150 Million of that tax on rerouting that train! Round and aroundcwe go!

7587 2018-05-12 21:22:42 Yeske! In addition a number of oil blocks were sold behind the books

Fake companies (asset/property management) were established to launder money "patiently"

The same era won highest record of owed salaries & pension
7588 2018-05-12 21:22:32 Well we had problems with ours when it was -6 so I think u would definitely have problems but maybe u can get different oil in them for colder weather
7589 2018-05-12 21:22:26 She giggles. "That I can get behind." His touch is so gentle. The oil warms her body slightly, the feeling breaking down any tension in her body.

7591 2018-05-12 21:22:20 I've got coconut oil in my hair to prep it for bleach and color after I get off work
7592 2018-05-12 21:22:19 I want someone who will massage me all over with lavender oil, feed me pomegranates and detangle my curls. And eat my cooking and let me lap dance on them. InshAllah we will find the love of our lives 
7593 2018-05-12 21:22:16 Great AIPAC statement!!

But without a plan what happens next? What would Irans leadership do, and with America leaning on Europe? 
tick tock tick buzz....
Answer is...Meet China's new client state. Iran has oil gas which China needs, and China has well everything. stupid!

7597 2018-05-12 21:21:33 Tea tree oil >>>>> coconut oil
7598 2018-05-12 21:21:21 i take off my makeup with coconut oil and then wash my face w a face wash my dermatologist gave me (it has salicylic acid in it) and then use the CereVe PM moisturizer!
7599 2018-05-12 21:21:19 It’s an oil can
7600 2018-05-12 21:20:56 Just got my oil changed and the sticker says the next one is due in 7500 miles. Is that a typo or is that the new thing?
7601 2018-05-12 21:20:42 Nicholas I appreciate your comment; and the Pareto seems unavoidable. However, in this case palm oil is not the issue either, it would be a lack of sourcing guidelines on behalf of buyers.
7602 2018-05-12 21:20:20 Finally stopped using Emulators and Roms for megadrive games and now have all the Sega Android versions sitting there ready for a long labour. Will be furious if the baby comes out halfway through the Oil level on Sonic 2.
7603 2018-05-12 21:20:17 We ain't lazy Nigerian youths. And this "oil" from above will keep running with more booms from infinity and beyond 
7604 2018-05-12 21:20:16 To heal a pimple quickly, apply tea tree oil on pimple every few hours, and apply vitamin E oil on the spot, about 1 hour before bedtime.
7605 2018-05-12 21:19:59 They must need oil and Russia is going to sell it to them. Plus, we just got out of Iraq.

7612 2018-05-12 21:18:15 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
7613 2018-05-12 21:17:53 hnnnn my cream smells so good and strong
maybe it just needed time or maybe i was too used to the undiluted oil earlier and that's why i thought it smelled weak. the oil hasn't separated or anything
7614 2018-05-12 21:17:42 No oil
7615 2018-05-12 21:17:37 Been using oil to cleanse my face for less than a week but man my skin is looking so much nicer already
7616 2018-05-12 21:16:45 Coconut oil is abs-solutely fantastic
7617 2018-05-12 21:16:27 Of course my skin decided to show out with these two big ass pimples, and I didn’t pack my tea tree oil .

7621 2018-05-12 21:15:59 The same booming economy where gas prices are rising, oil prices, farmers losing money due to tariffs, companies moving out of the country laying off thousands? That booming economy?
7622 2018-05-12 21:15:57  girl I got you. It’s all about locking the moisture in. So start with water then a leave in conditioner. Then find an oil and cream to put on top of that. I actually mix the two. I’m using ORS coconut and avocado curl smoothie and Jamaican Black Castor oil.
7623 2018-05-12 21:15:40 I saw a post that said smother yourself in baby oil for 30mins-1hour and it soaks off in the shower!!

7626 2018-05-12 21:15:29 Agree with what you're saying, but I'd prefer my husband ask because there are tasks that I am very particular about. I asked him to get my car's oil changed and he can go do that and have lunch with the kids while I have a blessed afternoon to myself.
7627 2018-05-12 21:15:19 Good for her.
But off duty cop or not, she never should have picked up his gun. Not with her bare hands, anyway. The oil from her hands contaminates the gun. If there was no video, then it'd be "she said, he said". Even with witnesses.
But glad she was there and armed.

7630 2018-05-12 21:13:59 That was quite a lot of smoke for a little engine?
First I filled the sump with petrol and then I ran it and then I dumped the oil/petrol mix and filled the sump with old hydraulic oil......
So maybe it will be okay?

Wow this is so amazing!

<coca cola has multiple places>
I can’t believe people put this in their bodies
7638 2018-05-12 21:12:33 That's your answer. Naira crashed when you solely depend on oil and the prices of Crude fell at the international market. Your likes that do Government's business stole the nation dry and when there was nothing to spend to cushion the effects of the fall in oil prices then
7639 2018-05-12 21:12:27 Same with Steel and Oil. No accident
7640 2018-05-12 21:12:27 Someone on my FB list had the same question.  She’s a native Southerner too.

I wouldn’t be able to visit my relatives in the South again if I bought one of those.  If I’m frying something, I want it frying in some type of oil.  #CountryBoy
7641 2018-05-12 21:12:22 Funny, since the Saudis and Russians have the most to gain by oil prices going up.

7667 2018-05-12 21:06:14 I understand, but we need to be more self-reliant. You have the power/influence to have regulations implemented & enforced that will keep oil spills from happening. I’m a NYC native, I’d rather see oil rigs than be dependent on another country.
7668 2018-05-12 21:06:06 & yes gas going to go up for everyone since no Iran deal gas oil prices on market jumped 4% Friday alone
7669 2018-05-12 21:05:58 Aye, OK. Do you know what the word "notional" means?
It's peppered throughout the GERS reports every year, along with estimate and poll.
What about the other half trillion?
Since 1900, I modestly estimate ~£300bn has gone on "Imperial services", all of which were before Oil boom.

7676 2018-05-12 21:05:17 And it's all for oil
7677 2018-05-12 21:04:57 Exactly...that is why they had to force prices up. We were set to walk away from oil within a decade until the morons got to vote for the decline of America

7687 2018-05-12 21:03:45 It is amazing how the brain works. Every aspect of lifestyle is a choice. Location to live, mode of transit, which products to buy in a free market. Choosing #carlife means being subjugated to oil market. Why are these people complaining about the life they chose?

That's probably also true if you forget the flour. (The one ingredient no one's ever forgotten.)

7706 2018-05-12 21:01:53 So many of those ‘meal plans’ and recipes also don’t take into account the costs of oil, salt, soy sauce, spices etc - basically anything that’s a ‘store cupboard staple’, you’re just supposed to magically have those already.

Under the US-DPRK Agreed Framework of 1994, DPRK agreed to freeze and destroy its nuclear program. As a reward, we gave them two light-water nuclear reactors, heavy fuel oil, and big reductions in trade barriers & financial transactions.

7731 2018-05-12 20:56:36 The oil industry is cyclical, prices rise and fall over time. 40$ was not sustainable over the long term. Even deep sea drilling requires ~75$ to incentivize further development

7738 2018-05-12 20:55:35 There's something therapeutic about putting oil on your skin
7739 2018-05-12 20:55:20 Hey @JackPosobiec Actually it was the Iranians who captured the ISIS leaders. The Mercs were kept on the back burner to be used if ownership of the oil wells is contested. This practice is no better than the Deep State.
7740 2018-05-12 20:55:13 Thankyou for the recipe . I’m not saying it doesn’t work . I’m saying I don’t need oil in my way

7748 2018-05-12 20:53:48 Like I said I agree with you however, oil prices are up because we a finally paying American oil workers due to drilling for more oil at home. Would you rather pay some mullah in the Middle East for it so they can use that money to fund terrorism? It’s a vicious circle. Thoughts?

7751 2018-05-12 20:53:38 We outright refuse to spend any more money on heating oil this year, so we’re trying to heat the downstairs with our lil fake wood stove, and it’ll work just fine (that’s what it’s there for) but we might be popsicles by the time it does. 
7752 2018-05-12 20:53:37 Alaskans own 1,835 shares of ESSO SA FRANCAISE, worth $81,743. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in FRANCE.
7753 2018-05-12 20:53:29 Volkswagen charged $80 for oil change and $30 for tire rotation. Pep Boys was giving me the oil change and tire rotation for $70.
7754 2018-05-12 20:53:19 Except as usual that's factually incorrect. The oil dividend has come back to Scotland in spades and continues to do so, this year alone our tax receipts are £13.7B less than our government spend including oil.

7764 2018-05-12 20:52:10 100%..ole Vlad is profiting with trump dumping the Iran deal and oil prices surging, trump looks like some kind of hero and we get increased gas prices and to pay for NKs rebuilding.
7765 2018-05-12 20:52:10 Are you spying on me? I just started taking CBD Oil, actually and I only "attack" stupid people..lol. So offensive.
7766 2018-05-12 20:52:06 That refinery was a massively subsidized government money pit that was completely unnecessary. There is excess refinery capacity all over North America, particularly ones set up to process heavy oil. And there's no difference between diesel and bitumen if there's no pipeline.
7767 2018-05-12 20:51:35 Maybe they struck oil.
7768 2018-05-12 20:51:27 Definitely no oil. Ghee very rarely used (in Indian cooking obv) but really unnecessary.

7771 2018-05-12 20:51:14 I went to bring my car in for a service check at @VW and they wanted an absurd amount for an oil change, not including tire rotation. So I said I’d go to @pepboysauto because they charge less. Then the service manager told me he’d do it for the same price as Pep Boys.

7773 2018-05-12 20:50:44 Here's why I won't buy #CITGO gas. September, 1986, Southland sold 50% interest in CITGO to Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A., (PDVSA), the national oil company of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. PDVSA acquired the remaining half of CITGO in January, 1990.

7779 2018-05-12 20:49:19 Ok thanks but I disagree about oil . Not needed imo
7780 2018-05-12 20:49:18 Getting triggered won’t change facts. Our electricity is 100% from renewables and in less than 20 years gas guzzlers will be a rarity on the streets . It’s the end of the line for oil.

7823 2018-05-12 20:43:04 Landlord has informed me I need to purchase and lay down a pad or rug or something in my parking space, because I have a slow oil leak (which he's known about for 2 years) and he's having the parking lot resurfaced in 2 wks. #really

7825 2018-05-12 20:42:57 The only smart contract that has *actually* seen any real world use case or utility is the #lightning network running on #Bitcoin. 

Practically everything else that currently exists is nothing but snake oil.

7830 2018-05-12 20:41:52 With Trump creating problems in the Middle East, America’s war to steal oil has begun.
7831 2018-05-12 20:41:49 Lap 41/85 and Wickens is in the pits.  Power again assumes the lead as the No. 6 team puts sticker primary Firestone skins on his Lucas Oil Honda and he is away.

Bourdais on pit road as well and he puts on the primary tire compound.

Power now coming in on lap 42.

7832 2018-05-12 20:41:35 How about Stephen Harper.  Harper had nine years as PM and he couldn’t build a single pipe line to the West Coast freeing landlocked Alberto oil 
7833 2018-05-12 20:41:24 And having now secumbed to the click-bait, guess what else would reduce the number of syringes littering San Francisco’s filthy (oil/gas/rubber/concrete/take-out doesn’t help either) streets?  Safe injection sites. Housing. Healthcare. Nah.  10 new jobs IV users can’t get.
7834 2018-05-12 20:41:22 lil Olive oil & lemon pepper seasoning soon as the wings come out. Lightly toss them hoes & you in there
7835 2018-05-12 20:41:06 I'm a 911 survivor I wish a president would buy oil from Sweden and Brazil and dump the Saudi prince ass for good
7836 2018-05-12 20:41:06 Only when they start using Amla oil.
7837 2018-05-12 20:40:54 Russia makes more money as oil prices surge. That’s where follow the money leads. He’s doing Putin’s bidding to prop up Russia’s sagging economy.
7838 2018-05-12 20:40:40 Ah who needs a seat at their table.
Question: Who are the members of the strategic advisory board of Geni Oil,  and what (If any) is their interest in the Golan Heights?
Oops . Internet real news has that one.
7839 2018-05-12 20:40:38 Not offended! I have a great carnitas recipe! It’s not a family recipe, it’s actually an epicurious recipe. Brown a pork shoulder (s&p) in oil, squeeze in half an orange, throw the peel in, add a cup of milk, add water to almost cover the meat, simmer for 3 hours in oven at 350
7840 2018-05-12 20:40:33 I can't find any of my tea tree oil. The devil is busy.

Winnipeg always brings the party. 
Thanks!
7846 2018-05-12 20:39:56 Oil prices have been rising since September, From 40 to 68. The Iran deal pull out only caused a slight 2$ appreciation in value at most
7847 2018-05-12 20:39:54 Same way they advertise rice, cooking oil (vegetable, soy, olive, sunflower, coconut) as cholesterol free. 
7848 2018-05-12 20:39:50 “I’M NOT CLEANING IT UP” 
Oil was so funny.
7849 2018-05-12 20:39:27 SO LAST NIGHT HULK INADVERTENTLY CREATED THE BEST SANDWICH EVER: PULLED CHICKEN LIGHTLY DRESSED IN RICE VINEGAR, OLIVE OIL, BUTTER, SALT,

7851 2018-05-12 20:39:12 So, you’re having problems with squirrels at your feeder, Zach? Well, you can get one of our feeders or we can try adjusting your blend—

(Zach snores softly, curled up atop the black oil sunflower seeds)
7852 2018-05-12 20:39:08 Which is great for those big oil coons already in power making billions per year because their competitors are now caught in a political cross fire of public dissent.
7853 2018-05-12 20:39:06 I use @StIvesSkin scrub every second day. LOVE this product and how it exfoliates my skin... definitely gets rid of any excess oil or dry skin I have 
7854 2018-05-12 20:38:52 Ugh I need an oil change so bad but I don’t have $80 
7855 2018-05-12 20:38:52 How many times have we voted for a #taxincrease to #fixourroads, yet the lions share of the increase goes for Denver or RTD, as if somehow the rest of the state doesn't exist? Yet here we are again, more taxes "to fix roads". Sorry guv, not buying your snake oil AGAIN.
7856 2018-05-12 20:38:35 Serious and proper sanctions can be imposed now. They only produce 7% of the world's oil & act like it's 90.  And no more palettes of cash. That game is over
7857 2018-05-12 20:38:26 I'm a purist. Avocado, salt, a little oil and lemon juice. Done.
7858 2018-05-12 20:38:22 Reister farms lamb t-bone with merguez crepinette or olive oil poached halibut? Hmmm
7859 2018-05-12 20:37:03 yet trudeau subsidizes and gives tax credits to eastern canada's imported by tankers....tankers that carry the dirties of heavy crude as ballast in their hulls....and flush this out sailing on north america east coast.....dirty oil of mid-east extraction
7860 2018-05-12 20:37:01 USA can and will do you friendly but first chaos,war, killing and false flag are lies, that's how we find (make) terrorists.put a new leader for the people (puppy) only paymnt. is your country's gold,oil resources and secrets of the area.but we are war-addicted so we stay f.ever

7870 2018-05-12 20:35:12 Yes. It’s vegetable oil, you decrepit moron. It’s fucking vegetable oil. You’ve really shown me, HaggisGeorge. Keep fighting the good fight by harassing strangers on the internet mate lmao
7871 2018-05-12 20:35:09  I know Lou. I always squeeze lemons in a touch of olive oil to get that perfect shine. 
7872 2018-05-12 20:35:09 Have you ever been to the coast, where the oil tankers dock?  It's already disgusting.  It could be cleaned up, via our pipelines and our boats.  With our laws, our boats are safer, but I guess you must trust the Saudi oil coming here.  Have you seen their boats?
7873 2018-05-12 20:35:08 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?
7874 2018-05-12 20:35:01 なんや雨の降りそうな空やな
7875 2018-05-12 20:35:00 Trump is owned by Putin. So far, the new administration is cooperating 100% with Putin's requests to debase our nation and stab ourselves in the back. Putin gains ascendancy in the Middle East, oil prices rise, the US becomes isolated from its historical allies.
7876 2018-05-12 20:34:44 Woo. My main concern was for anything aerosol based, I had bad visions of what might happen haha. Mines got a minor oil leak (being sorted next week) so everything stinks of oil (trickling onto manifold) 
7877 2018-05-12 20:34:43 Depends on your aim and the type of oil. For instance there are oil mixes that I use for growth but I have to wash out after an hour, but I also use olive oil to prevent my scalp from drying out and I only wash that out a few days later on wash day
7878 2018-05-12 20:34:38 @LinusTech Hey guys! I am really scared of water in electronic. Can i just swap water with oil in a liquid cooling system?
7879 2018-05-12 20:34:29 The demand for data is on the rise, I believe soon, it wld be needed to make transformational changes in the country, businesses wld need data to grow, industries and companies wld need data to produce, it wld be the new oil. And  soon people like Dr Kale wld be given due regard.
7880 2018-05-12 20:34:08 good. also sustainable palm oil and fat all round, please.

7888 2018-05-12 20:32:41 Siri just autocorrected “lube” to “love” and tbh Gun Oil is the longest and best relationship of my life.
7889 2018-05-12 20:32:27 @makeupbyjaack have you tried using olive oil and brown sugar as a exfoliater and using a face wash after I find this to be the one thing that helps with breakouts 
7890 2018-05-12 20:32:24 That's a truly terrible cocktail. Either 50/50 Monster and rum, or 50/50 petroleum and motor oil. Much "tastier".
7891 2018-05-12 20:32:13 They’ve already got a name though. They’ve had it for decades, maybe centuries “snake oil salesmen”.

7896 2018-05-12 20:30:51 Fun fact about making brownies: when the box instructions call for vegetable oil, olive oil doesn't give the same result
7897 2018-05-12 20:30:45 Hasn't moved in a long time, I'm afraid. Went into the pits for oil pressure problems. #24hNBR
7898 2018-05-12 20:30:41 Still tryin to figure out why these republican Alt-right Nazis are OK with Sheldon Adelson being gifted 700 million in tax breaks while tRump raises the cost of gas, food, insurance etc. to pay for it. tRump is creating instability because Putin ordered him to raise oil prices.
7899 2018-05-12 20:30:37 If you think it's evil- STOP BEING A CONSUMER OF IT. No one is making you use oil.

7904 2018-05-12 20:29:42 When I'm rich, I'm going to start a renewable energy company that provides energy for a minimal price. The idea would be to use the company to destroy oil and gas trusts.
7905 2018-05-12 20:29:41 The Manta is done for today with issues in the oil pressure system...
7906 2018-05-12 20:29:20 Every time the Russian army messes with our military we should export more oil to Europe.
7907 2018-05-12 20:29:03  change oil. Sarap ng vrrooooom
7908 2018-05-12 20:28:50 One thing I’ve learned in Italy is that I absolutely LOVE olive oil on salads.
7909 2018-05-12 20:28:47 Is it vegetable oil?
7910 2018-05-12 20:28:38 For those who think players should never slide headfirst, the A's just cost themselves the lead by not doing so.
7911 2018-05-12 20:27:56 I'm noticing things. Brass hand oil, etc
7912 2018-05-12 20:27:49 LOL at this hypebeast with a Supreme backpack, Griffey jersey and Space Jams coming into Les Schwab asking for an oil change.

Who’s raising these children?
7913 2018-05-12 20:27:49 CBD OIL. I’m not kidding!
7914 2018-05-12 20:27:48 Oil...crude,up $50. a barrel since no deal talks in Jan. Our working class will use 1/2 of their monthly #TaxScam savings so we can pay Putin’s higher oil prices. A cunning plan which allows for more Russian RE after the presidency is over. WE ARE NOW BUYING  INFRASTRUCTURE.
7915 2018-05-12 20:27:42 Damn girl, what you gon do with all that ass. That baby oil is holy water, have you ever met a nigga wit too much cash?

7917 2018-05-12 20:27:18 Ladies try chapter 2000 (hairfood) mix with castor oil and coconut oil.
7918 2018-05-12 20:27:02 In the name of ‘Make in India’ & ‘Ease of Doing Business’, corporates, domestic & foreign, are invited by @BJP4India to exploit country’s resources, including oil, gas & other natural resources as well as workers. @India_Resists #Jan_Ekata_Jan_Adhikar_Andolan #23rdMayAgitation
7919 2018-05-12 20:26:46 16 year olds can work with a workers permit in CA.  18 can enlist to fight for oil.  Don’t forget that there are thousands of kids working on farms without protections. Plenty of corp exploitation daily.  Unionize = Protection’s
7920 2018-05-12 20:26:41 How? So you can keep your taxes low and blow more resource wealth as Alberta has in the past? You’re broke because Albertans let the Tories blow the revenue fro oil and gas!

7924 2018-05-12 20:26:05 I’m sure you love them for real , about right now ! I think the issue is that once easily drillable oil decreases over time , the cost to locate and produce may rise ( in certain parts of the world ) beyond the return on investment.
7925 2018-05-12 20:26:00 We should only have allowed Australia in if they promised gat Midnight Oil would put in an entry #eurovision
7926 2018-05-12 20:25:53 Talking about the Royal cemetery..very interesting.. I want u to remember when you was still in office as a governor of Delta state..u launched a book called..Delta Beyond Oil..on that book page 76 you said the Royal cemetery is 25 hectal of land...and u demolish more than 320
7927 2018-05-12 20:25:44 Hope that Iran can continue its deal with Europe, China, and Russia so that they can trade oil and other economic effect.

7929 2018-05-12 20:25:42 One of the biodiversity hotspots on this planet for spiders and insects is New Guinea. Unfortunately it's being destroyed at an alarming rate by the palm oil industry. Countless unknown species will disappear ...

7930 2018-05-12 20:25:32 update: baby oil is amazing for getting fake tan off
7931 2018-05-12 20:25:27 There is no THC in CBD oil, and you don’t smoke it. You won’t get high or have any kind of euphoric feelings. It does help alleviate pain and may help reduce tumor size, severity and length of seizures, among other things.
7932 2018-05-12 20:25:20 Tanking the Iran Deal makes perfect logical sense. For Russia. Oil prices rise. Russia makes money. US undermines allies.
7933 2018-05-12 20:25:18 Members of the armed forces have joined civilians in protecting our HQ. The tide is turning against those who steal oil, votes and hope
7934 2018-05-12 20:25:05 Nah bro, The best you can get on twitter is a Petrol attendant at Forte Oil, nah bro, maybe when I meet him personally then the sky is my limit .
7935 2018-05-12 20:24:58 Coconut oil. For everything. 
7936 2018-05-12 20:24:53 If anybody is selling snake oil it's the people who deny racism & who are out-of-touch with the issues that are important to blacks & other minorities. This has absolutely nothing to do with Bill Cosy and President Obama. An apology is in order as this is insulting to us blacks.
7937 2018-05-12 20:24:48 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt.

7953 2018-05-12 20:22:55 Ha, Rodney has been previously involved with attempting to crowdfund the oil and gas industry!  Funny how often naysayers to moving the transportation industry forward are stuck in the past..
7954 2018-05-12 20:22:50 Used to use corrugated cardboard on the driveway when I changed my own oil.  Apparently Topps bubblegum works just as well, apparently.

7956 2018-05-12 20:22:39 Would have been such a short brainstorm. Reckon they heard @LidlUK had a deal on beard oil and they just wanted to get out of there!
7957 2018-05-12 20:22:38 Searching for oil status
7958 2018-05-12 20:22:30 URGENT: Trump and Interior Secretary Zinke are rushing to open the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Act now and stand up against any move to open the Arctic Refuge to Big Polluters!
7959 2018-05-12 20:22:16 Also it will take away some of the bitterness of the Onion if you do saute them olive oil pinch salt pepper and fresh pureed  (also should boil the garlic cloves takes away bitterness and lessens garlic breath) garlic cloves
7960 2018-05-12 20:22:09 3) Trump has ended the surveillance of Iranian nuclear sites and also put restrictions on how much oil Iran can export. This causes a nuclear arms race in the middle east, and destabilizes oil prices by giving Russia and Saudi the vast majority of control in the oil market.
7961 2018-05-12 20:21:50 Finally Ken, an article that may have merit.
7962 2018-05-12 20:21:44 Baby oil optional ?
7963 2018-05-12 20:21:42 lol , like oldham lad at crown oil arena lolo
7964 2018-05-12 20:21:34 Tea Tree Oil is a gift from God
7965 2018-05-12 20:21:25 Cinnamon raisin Bread oil and vinegar Gargonzola Cheese Chicken Onions Banana peppers Red pepper flakes
7966 2018-05-12 20:21:21 @ihavenohat can i come over to your place tomorrow
7967 2018-05-12 20:21:16 Hahahaha Hahahaha. As Quebec imports DIRTY oil from all other Cuntries.  That explains it all. Then takes Transfer Payments from Alberta’s oil and Gas Resources. Holy Fuck. I thought Al Gote and David Suzuki were idiots, but looks like there a guy in Quebec that just joined them
7968 2018-05-12 20:21:05 On eve of @SPIEF bad news for @KremlinRussia_E - Goldman Sachs was latest to revise Russian growth from 3.3% down to 2%, still overly optimistic. And that despite record oil and commodity prices. Something is wrong in Nabiullina and Siluanov neoliberal policy?
7969 2018-05-12 20:20:44 That's why I love my oil stocks, plus pay dividends around 4%. Eventually the world will run out of oil, don't you think? As it runs short, the price rises. But stocks may fall if reserves go down. Contradictory tendencies.
7970 2018-05-12 20:20:43 Too Bad #TRUMP & #Friends decided to WALK OUT ON IRAN, leaving YET ANOTHER #POLITICALLY #IMPORTANT #REGION  for #CHINA to WAlk Right INTO! Even #RUSSIA won't take on #CHINA! So, Despite #Putin's Plans, the #MiddleEast goes to...#CHINA! All that #OIL, #GAS, and #MARKET!
7971 2018-05-12 20:20:41 2) The JCPOA prevented Iran from enriching uranium over 4%, while 90% or higher purity is required to create weapons with uranium. The deal also gave Iran unrestricted limits on the export of oil so as to create stability in the oil markets of the world. By leaving the JCPOA
7972 2018-05-12 20:20:23 Stop thinking every nigga that change your oil is the one.
7973 2018-05-12 20:20:10 Denmark looks like he only drinks beaver town neck oil in a pub in North London that no one else has heard of #Eurovision
7974 2018-05-12 20:20:08 @realDonaldTrump being the antichrist incarnate, well he'll come up with some form of snake oil for his blind faith followers.

7977 2018-05-12 20:19:51 イヤーな予感はしてた
7978 2018-05-12 20:19:47 Denmark just raised the value of Beard oil world wide #eurovision
7979 2018-05-12 20:19:44 Now Denmark has been on I presume someone is going to have to hose the stage down to get rid of the copious amounts of beard oil they've undoubtedly left behind them  #Eurovision2018
7980 2018-05-12 20:19:27 These guys are the reason there's a national shortage of beard oil in Denmark. #Eurovision

7 “Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps. 8 The foolish ones said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.’
7982 2018-05-12 20:19:08 Thank you, someone told me to use baby oil to try to help get it off to hurt her less/ not hurt her so I’m gonna try that!
7983 2018-05-12 20:18:59 部屋とワイシャツとオイル
7984 2018-05-12 20:18:50 Holy crap.  You two should stay clear of the oil and gas industry...bc you know nothing about it. And yes, there are lots of rich farmers including my brother-in-law and hutterite colonies to name a few.
7985 2018-05-12 20:18:44 Wash and oil this bihh down
7986 2018-05-12 20:18:35 Someone gave the Night's Watch conditioner and beard oil: I like it but then again when it comes to beards I cant be trusted #eurovision #den
7987 2018-05-12 20:18:06 I expect it will feed on oil &bolts :-)
7988 2018-05-12 20:18:00 My mate was on duty. Got a call from coastguard who were launching a major incident response to an oil rig disaster. Only confused, as the epirb co-ord's were on dry land...
7989 2018-05-12 20:17:09 Ok CBD oil work. I freaking hurt.
7990 2018-05-12 20:17:08 It’s 5:30 am and dark and I’m checking oil and water and cleaning out my car. There’s something wrong with this picture? lol
7991 2018-05-12 20:16:46 @KremlinRussia_E “Vodka” for heating oil I suppose....... good luck with it all. @Raptors
7992 2018-05-12 20:16:43 I am clueless. I was told to eat less salt and oil but I don't really eat a lot of those. I just have to quit caffeine, unless if stress is also a contributing factor. I just don't know where to start
7993 2018-05-12 20:16:39 Strange article. First I've ever seen that was positive news for the market. What's up with it's quotes of low oil and interest rates? What type of audience do they think is reading their material? Strange
7994 2018-05-12 20:16:29 I heard that if you apply baby oil, let it soak in for 10mins then get in the shower, it will come right off with a flannel.
7995 2018-05-12 20:16:24 Aaaah yes
And an authority as well for good measure. This is gold!
Or oil if you American.
Thanks a million. 
We had a similar thing at work once. We did a cease and desist letter
But this thread, the author deserves a beer or two. On your tab of course 
7996 2018-05-12 20:16:23 Yucky white working class oil aphobe!
7997 2018-05-12 20:16:23 It's like the North Sea Oil & Gas: you could try blaming the SNP for the utter shite management of the trillions of turnover in the Oil industry leaving us with nothing much to show for it, but it's been under the management of the UK gov all these decades...
7998 2018-05-12 20:16:20 Was looking forward to my @FrancoMancaPizz all day but it was so covered in oil i couldn't bare to it eat it  so disappointed!
7999 2018-05-12 20:16:16 Not to mention rising oil prices since election also help.
8000 2018-05-12 20:16:13 Chapman is starting to self destruct...
8001 2018-05-12 20:16:11 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
8002 2018-05-12 20:15:52 Price of gasoline has already gone up-at least in my neck of the woods. Not just Iran uncertainty , but also events in Venezuela (Conoco seizure of PDVSA assets & slow motion collapse of PDVSA.) I think price spike is just beginning , as removal of oil from market means price >
8003 2018-05-12 20:15:49 I got food sensitivity testing it helped out. I had to give up most dairy, soy and eggs. Also avoid any makeup with mineral oil and silicone.

8005 2018-05-12 20:15:47 Combine 9 oz clams with 8 oz bacon. Add generous amounts of Olive Oil. Stir-fry. Serve with a nice chianti.
8006 2018-05-12 20:15:20 @Unilever just watched the @bbctwo documentary about palm oil from this week. Interested to know what Unilever do to reduce Palm oil use ensure their procurement policy ensures sustainable supply?
8007 2018-05-12 20:15:19 Mayor Lewis what are you doing with the truffle oil-
8008 2018-05-12 20:15:04 Oil caps with folding design. We are good at multi-cavities cap injected molds with optimal cooling and air venting system, fast delivery caps tool. Email: sino6001@sinomould.com  What's APP:+8615168642559
8009 2018-05-12 20:14:56 That feeling when the oil touches the scalp
8010 2018-05-12 20:14:55 Not so simple. Oil royalties were set by conservative government and then reviewed by socialist anti-oil @albertaNDP and NOT changed. It’s the best royalty system around otherwise it would have been changed. Gas prices also far lower and US a far FAR higher volume producer today!
8011 2018-05-12 20:14:37 Sorry about that have you tried to change its food? Or just add fish oil to the food that will work
8012 2018-05-12 20:14:33 You're partially right, but mostly wrong. Now go do some research on why oil is increasing.
8013 2018-05-12 20:14:17 Like palm oil
8014 2018-05-12 20:14:05 Drove all the way to @LHMToyotaMurray to get my paid for service agreement oil change, just to have the tiny man shoo me away saying they were “too booked, too booked”. No courtesy apology, no offer to book another time, just me backing up, feeing like I did something wrong...
8015 2018-05-12 20:14:01 How were they supposed to benefit? Make health insurance un-affordable or taken away altogether, tax cuts to the wealthy, reduce regulations that will open up lands to oil drilling and pollution. Just to name a few.
8016 2018-05-12 20:13:49 No OIL. Move Along!
8017 2018-05-12 20:13:43 I smell like oil and gunpowder and I never want to not smell this way.

8021 2018-05-12 20:12:36 Who get to decide about who gets subsidies? Governments decided to subsidize oil in a much greater extent, to the _detriment_ of air quality for decades. It's a stronger force than what the market gets to decide, where completion is harsh and profit is derived from actual _value_
8022 2018-05-12 20:11:55 I think he knows that. Even if he isnt smart enough to actually understand what hes reading, or hearing, some1 near him does & the Saudi's have the "magic ORB" he put his hands on & a SH*T TON of $$, & Oil.. Trump likes oil & we know he worships$$, therefore he likes the Saudi's
8023 2018-05-12 20:11:40 I know you just have to deal with the oil for a few weeks until your hair gets used to not being washed everyday
8024 2018-05-12 20:11:37 I turned my bedside table into a “wellness station” got my salt lamp, box of Kleenex, oil diffuser, body oils/whips and birth control. I’m slowly getting my life together
8025 2018-05-12 20:11:31 @pladis_Global just watched the @BBCTwo documentary on palm oil from this week. Interested to know your position on its use and your procurement policy to ensure it is sourced sustainably!?
8026 2018-05-12 20:11:31 Had to go in shoulder deep of garbage to retrieve notes I need for my story but threw out. I have so far cleaned off dried yogurt, pasta oil stains, coffee stains and parmasean cheese.

8028 2018-05-12 20:11:08 And the price of oil is going up. You pay at the pump.
8029 2018-05-12 20:11:00 Damn, didn't know there was a live show in Jerusalem  have lots of fun and be careful around the oil bois.
8030 2018-05-12 20:10:53 Too many people still rolling on winter stock. Above fifteen they get greasy. By the mid twenties, you might as well coat them in oil before driving.
8031 2018-05-12 20:10:47 Yes! Be it getting oil rigs or building refineries or operating illegal refineries just to mention a few.
8032 2018-05-12 20:10:24 Dabbing=concentrated THC oil and heated with a blow torch. Inhale vapors. Super potent, more so than edibles. @vbebarta #rebellion18

8035 2018-05-12 20:10:04 They were captured by Iraq & have been reporting this for months. US coalition have ignored them. Why? Because ISIS were guarding the Syrian oil fields for corporate oil barons. US were moving in Kurds to do the job for ISIS. Now the Kurds know they will be stabbed in back by CIA

8051 2018-05-12 20:08:57 you eh imagine I missed the oil because you didn't tag me
8052 2018-05-12 20:08:50 Heb.1:8-9 But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
8053 2018-05-12 20:08:18 This gets repeated on and near reservations throughout the West where mining, gas, and oil companies rape the land of its riches, create toxic wasteland that aren't cleaned up or restored and ruin water supplies of indigenous people, our government YOUR government does nothing
8054 2018-05-12 20:08:16 A couple of gf’s of mine a few years ago put cooking oil on to sunbathe with .. needless to say they ended up in hospital and the local paper
8055 2018-05-12 20:07:56 LOL
Whiskey, that was made in Armenia, costs $5 per glass, by the way, smells like rotten oil!

8059 2018-05-12 20:07:32 Keeping an eye on the brake pads & crank oil seals?
8060 2018-05-12 20:07:22 The guitar player is a good argument on the importance of using a good conditioner. (and doing the occasional oil treatment.) Or did the back up singers STEAL all the quality hair products? #Eurovision
8061 2018-05-12 20:07:14 Al, Al the kiddies pal say nothing about how dirty California oil is.
8062 2018-05-12 20:07:09 Baby oil and swimwear shoots!
8063 2018-05-12 20:07:05 I am currently re-seasoning my cast iron griddle pan in the oven. My flat smells like olive oil and now I'm hungry again!
8064 2018-05-12 20:07:03 Yeah, she's got dandruff! Her skin is really dry because she can't reach to clean herself properly so those oil glands don't get stimulated enough. This helps a little bit!
8065 2018-05-12 20:06:45 No I don't want you to check my oil you dumb fuck. Put some fuel in it, I have places to be.
8066 2018-05-12 20:06:42 You’re now talking bro. These Nigerian billionaires make money from involvement with govt. ask yourself. How did alakija (a fashion designer with no history of business success ) emerge as the richest black woman coincidentally after receiving an oil bloc from the govt ?
8067 2018-05-12 20:06:42 I watched @chakabars oil his scalp this morning and I haven’t been the same since.

What about the oil system they run???
#dirtyracing #theywillgetwhatscoming #ohnowaititsfarrari!!!#cheatingw***kers
8069 2018-05-12 20:06:07 should i call 911 or something cuz this reads like you had a stroke while writing it...?
Tossing word salad like that is usually a pretty bad warning sign. Unless somehow you're about to tell us all about how we should thank oil companies for our democratic rights...?
8070 2018-05-12 20:06:06 I think they had to take off or redo the things that where giving them an  advantage.  The oil in the fuel the blown exhaust.     They were pushing the rules to far had to back off.
8071 2018-05-12 20:05:58 Nobody said “total shutdown” this is hyperbole and scare tactics. A gradual slowdown and wind up of oil extraction over the next 10-15 years is totally possible. Basically stop building new infrastructure and subsidize green alternatives instead of making oil barons billionaires
8072 2018-05-12 20:05:51 The Ultimate Sunday Plan  Redemption Sundays Bob Marley's Special happening tomorrow at Temptations Lounge, Embakasi behind National Oil Petrol Station  We dweet in a rub a dub style. Make a date & Tag a Friend along. Karibuni

8074 2018-05-12 20:05:26 Saudis,israilis pressurised Trump to come out Iran nuclear deal. Now oil price will rise up.I think India should continue trade with Iran because other two super powers like China, Russia are also trading with Iran. And Iran provide us oil on cheap prise than Saudi,usa,iraq.
8075 2018-05-12 20:05:20 Magnesium oil will help with anxiety. Stress depletes Magnesium levels. ‘Now’ True Calm are also very affective.
8076 2018-05-12 20:05:17 So you look cyber, with all his oil funds and think that a smallie like me dey same level with him?

Well, just like your governor, sense no too dey.

8084 2018-05-12 20:03:25 And those steel drums playing thru the airport!! And the smell of lovely suntan oil fanning through the airport, too....
8085 2018-05-12 20:03:20 Argan oil, Olive oil, castor oil, avocado oil, jojoba oil some people recommend coconut oil. I don't use it because it makes my hair dry. 

It's honestly a trial and error thing. Nawe nje you'll see what your hair loves. It's different for everyone.
8086 2018-05-12 20:03:18 Never had oil revenues. Ya thicko
8087 2018-05-12 20:03:16 You’d give a minimum wage mcdonalds teenage worker a stroke from the amount of oil it’ll take to fry $100 worth of Chicken Nuggets.

8093 2018-05-12 20:02:10 Are you also looking for appointment? What is your field and how old are you? Are you a member of a political party? A former Minister for Petroleum who single handedly built all the refineries without an oil block and also became head of state & did not looting our treasury.
8094 2018-05-12 20:02:07 He knew about the Cohen accounts months before the information found its way to the public. He knows that the Qatar government is bribing elected officials, he knows Russia, Saudi and other OPEC members are colluding with the US govt to drive oil prices sky high, he knows it all.
8095 2018-05-12 20:02:01 Corbyn sees everything through the prism of 1970’s labour relations.
But we don’t have British; steel, oil, coal, leyland etc anymore.
And no manufacturing industry.
He is an idiot and a dangerous idiot because he plays the pied piper...
8096 2018-05-12 20:01:54 I got my oil change for free last time but I think it was for another reason  not complaining though
8097 2018-05-12 20:01:53 Crypto crooks claim there's a problem with how the data is being stored.
Anyone with an ounce of experience knows the real issue isn't how the data is being stored, but how it's being collected.
Nonetheless, the blockchain oil salesmen managed to get away with simpletons' money.
8098 2018-05-12 20:01:53 おめでとうなのです！
8099 2018-05-12 20:01:51 Oil prices high, oil companies happy stick market greed good and we the people screwed.

8112 2018-05-12 20:00:00 No. They elected Chavez Because he said the Rich oil barons were greedy and mean. He promised to redistribute the wealth. He then nationalized their economy, and now they are getting eating garbage and vermin in the street.
8113 2018-05-12 20:00:00 The U.S. is currently exporting 1.6 million barrels of oil per day, and Texas ports like Corpus Christi play a vital role in making that happen.
8114 2018-05-12 19:59:48 Everything on my dash is TCAF or Eurovision and honestly, I'm happy people are happy. I'm giving my cat a coconut oil massage and she is Not.

8116 2018-05-12 19:59:42 I hope that after the POTUS gets done with the drug companies and their high priced drugs he will go after BIG OIL and get the price of gas down. Thought I read where the US has more oil then the Middle East so why do we let them effect our prices? Drill Baby Drill,
8117 2018-05-12 19:59:35 Coconut oil is where it’s at girl

8122 2018-05-12 19:58:36 Yep I also need to buy it! Today I saw the oil at a market and there it was a little bit too expensive.
8123 2018-05-12 19:58:36 That includes stoning, being boiled in oil and being crucified upside down..  prosperity preachers don't talk much on these things.

8132 2018-05-12 19:57:23 Yeah I know that feel. I kind of get that way with anything more complicated than an oil change. 

Always tempted to pay someone else to do it just to get it done and move on with my life.
8133 2018-05-12 19:56:42 We got low productivity (because since 1979 we have lost most of our manufacturing base ) and we have never recovered & we had north sea oil as well and now austerity,same old Tories looking after bankers in the city.
8134 2018-05-12 19:56:29 When oil price per barrel rises, gas prices also rises.  Russia didn’t want the Iran deal in the first place.  Russia’s economy was strong when the oil price per barrel was high.   Russia needed someone to help them position themselves for a comeback.

8144 2018-05-12 19:55:20 Cooking things in oil is just? :
Get splattered with hot oil? Take a step back and watch and repeat until you're far enough away to stop getting burned
8145 2018-05-12 19:54:57 I will need memory dipped in oil  after trying this, *deletes system 32*

8148 2018-05-12 19:54:48 And that was the whole point of @readDonaldTrump 's breaking the deal, instability and the rise in oil prices, he cares not about the rest. The Oil Companies got what they wanted.

8166 2018-05-12 19:51:35 This article says “there are connections” between this guy and Putin. He is a Russian oil magnate born in Ukraine, who lived in Russia. Blavatnik is definitely a Russian mobster. 
The story in question rated false a $$ donation claim re: Walker.  Nice try.

8167 2018-05-12 19:51:27 Lard or cooking oil. Don’t see lard so much these days
8168 2018-05-12 19:51:22 I think it's nice of the US to support regional re- development in Scotland, a country with no oil.

8190 2018-05-12 19:48:57 Krispy Cream had a issue here in New England. The oil or what ever it is called that they made there donuts with was in a tank outside the store on a pump. Well din't pump in the cold N.E. weather..They didn't do well. I am a Dunkin Donuts person
8191 2018-05-12 19:48:48 I remember introducing myself to a lady and told her I was ‘into oil and gas’. The woman gave a big ‘sigh’ and said are you afraid to say Yahoo Yahoo. I almost cried that day.

8201 2018-05-12 19:46:59 Why can't AB sell the oil to Canada? Feds would rather buy oil from inhumane countries instead of using our own oil. Germany's economy never falters because they by German products and use their own resources. They pay a little more but have jobs.
8202 2018-05-12 19:46:46 Yes they are. And we need domestic refineries instead of sending our oil to USA refineries and importing back at greedy inflated prices! Last time gas prices this high oil @ $120, now $71.

8210 2018-05-12 19:45:08 Hurry up and build a pipeline so that CDN oil doesn't have to be shipped via higher cost rail to the only geographically potential customer (the US) which is killing us on refining charges. Oh yeah, then there's also all those taxes....
8211 2018-05-12 19:45:07 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
8212 2018-05-12 19:44:58 If it's true what they get in return? I don't think someone come and build our country block by block without getting a big thing to return. I wonder what it will be? Maybe our resources like oil.

8218 2018-05-12 19:44:28 Ya kinda just gotta let the oil hang around at first until your hair gets used to it! Or try using dry shampoo to st least make it look less oily. And make sure you’re using a good shampoo/conditioner!

8236 2018-05-12 19:41:32 @Lionheart0075  Palm oil is disguised by uusing other names .. must Google but I'm reading  "modified palm" at store now. I would a think that's marketing nonsense. I'm going to say NO! IF IN DOUBT, LEAVE IT OUT! 
8237 2018-05-12 19:41:21 I'd say your guess is correct. It reminds me of the random oil pumps around some parts of Kansas where I grew up.

8246 2018-05-12 19:40:29 Like the replies in that thread said, Flint, MI and PR need to just get together and develop a nuclear weapons program; maybe then they'll get some attention from Drumpf.

Either that, or discover proven oil reserves on their land -- they'll DEFINITELY get attention then . . .

8290 2018-05-12 19:33:31 Wealth and capitalism in America came about through violence including this stealing of land from Indigenous people and later the trafficking of Africans through slavery. Wealth is still created and added to by violence under capitalism, such as wars for ownership of oil etc.
8291 2018-05-12 19:33:26 Yes it is a scam, and the small tax cut I got now goes to my gas tank, since the tax prices are sky rocketing again since these clowns had to pull out of the Iranian deal to help the oil companies make record profits again
8292 2018-05-12 19:33:23 I'm not sure about Australia - although I was just there! I didn't review their coconut oil selection. In the US, many health food stores & markets offer several different kinds - a liquid form, a refined (tasteless form w/ lower antioxidant content) & the "virgin" form.
8293 2018-05-12 19:33:02 The one thing that is far more pathetic then a naricisistic president is the people who follow him blindly. Tromp is a snake oil salesmen. He dropped the press release about these men coming home just so he could have a feel good moments. Not for these men at all....

Shanghai contract & reserve build gives China market power to take on sell-side who have had it their own way too long

8369 2018-05-12 19:19:28 And somehow for you that means drill for more oil that we already have and subsidize oil infrastructure that has a 30-40 year lifespan?? How is that transitioning? And to suggest energy poverty in Canada is mostly laughable.
8370 2018-05-12 19:19:28 Baby what? Why do you think people use mayo to get rid of lice?! Please help me lmao. Mayo is fucking oil.

8373 2018-05-12 19:18:41 Today was the memorial for dear friend @TheExTeens’ dad #RichardGlickman. He invented the fog machines we use for filming— replacing ones that piped mineral oil (and gave breathers the supreme runs). As someone who’s breathed a ton of fog, just want to say thank you, Dick. 
8374 2018-05-12 19:18:40 if you don't brush/oil/just fucking take care of your facial hair, do not fucking have any,,, please im begging for once.
8375 2018-05-12 19:18:32 Veterans are twice as likely as non-veterans to die from accidental overdoses involving prescription opioids. In an effort to lower opioid intake, some veterans are turning to hemp products, like CBD oil, to treat chronic pain and PTSD.

8376 2018-05-12 19:18:07 tbh ,I only use @PONDS_SA  spot clearing face wash and gel when I see a pimple.

To keep it glowing,hydrated & spotless I use tissue/coconut oil.

That’s all...I also try not to sleep with make up and wash/change my pillow case regularly .
 
8377 2018-05-12 19:17:56 And if I say some Nigerian youths just want to sit and do nothing because they think their country is an oil producing country, some would say yahoo boys aren't lazy. @officialEFCC well done.
8378 2018-05-12 19:17:52 Transparency would be nice from Mr Butts whether he still stands by his WWF position that oil sands should remain in the ground and if his wife still holds an exec position in the WWF. I asked for this info a few weeks ago. No response as yet.
8379 2018-05-12 19:17:49 Were you looking at the mud, the low tire pressure or “change oil soon”?
8380 2018-05-12 19:17:42 organic coconut oil should NEVER be used as a replacement for tanning oil. 30 minuets laying out and I have blisters. just an fyi if anyone else gets ignorant ideas like myself 
8381 2018-05-12 19:17:41 GOP the party of oil. And profiteering. Oh and war, fear mongering, fake Christians, racism, debauchery, corruption, immorality, fraud, hatred, lies, and lets not forget smokey eye shadow.

8406 2018-05-12 19:13:32 Doesn't pressure turn it into oil? Oil... at the bottom of the Mariana Trench!
8407 2018-05-12 19:13:11 that’s all very well - but unless the Chairman and rest of NOC start clamping down on the rampant corruption taking place at highest echelons of Libyan oil industry ,it won’t be possible for British companies to do business there anyway.(legally at least)
8408 2018-05-12 19:13:06 Why are people in Carpenteria complaining about the smell of pot farms, when they never complained about the tarry sulfury smell of off-shore oil rigs that's been there since the 60s?

8412 2018-05-12 19:12:35 And the amount of oil. It’s not like it’s 1 egg and 1 table spoon of oil. It’s a whole gallon of oil and about 3-4 eggs. Even if good oil, it’s a ton of oil in mayo.
8413 2018-05-12 19:12:32  Don’t be deceived by the oil
8414 2018-05-12 19:11:08 yeah clay is a pita. that can be fixed by adding (a lot of) organic matter, it holds water & holds the dirt together so it doesn't turn into an oil slick

8418 2018-05-12 19:10:37 Oil companies contribute a lot of money - to schools - STARS Ambulance - Parks - just to name a few. The revenue we are losing is going to cost us big, nevermind the taxes lost from unemployed workers
8419 2018-05-12 19:10:35 So, oil companies and banking institutions are against us? Clearly, we have the moral high ground.
8420 2018-05-12 19:10:30 Time to park it and get out and pray for the oil man to arrive.

8425 2018-05-12 19:09:52 I think Shanghai oil contract is a strategic market initiative way more important than Western market observers realise. It's entirely possible China will be able to exert market power (backed by 700m reserves recently stashed) to drag price down to the gas heat rate

Maduro te prestará al 16%?!?


8428 2018-05-12 19:09:39 We should have taken Iran's oil. We could lower the gas prices and help save money for our crunchy roll subscriptions.
8429 2018-05-12 19:09:26 Never will I ever see anything that exceeds the level of extraness of Emma Young Vickers sending me £10 for a bottle of baby oil

8433 2018-05-12 19:08:59 The problem is what oil is being used? I don't think industrial seed oils are very good.
8434 2018-05-12 19:08:52 uh... why couldn’t he still do the oil change? 
8435 2018-05-12 19:08:51 Lots of oil helps a lot. And clean shaven aswell. I need to shave my cock again soon.
8436 2018-05-12 19:08:45 Agreed. Like I said, fully empathize there. It’s also a calling card for any number and sort of snake oil salesman too. It’s what, in part, drives the alternative medicine industry.
8437 2018-05-12 19:08:39 I don't like them putting chemicals in the oil that are turning the frickin fats trans
8438 2018-05-12 19:08:32 Neither Greenpeace or Gore have credibility. Gore the hypocrite makes his fortune by selling his failed cable network to the Arab Al Jazeera. Greenpeace lies continually & finally gets called out by Resolute Forest. Gore knows the US benefits hugely by buying cheap Canadian oil!
8439 2018-05-12 19:08:30 I honestly didn't think anything could live in the Gulf of Mexico with all the oil spills they have had.  Interesting...
8440 2018-05-12 19:08:24 Most of our oil comes from Canada, I think. That will be fun to pay at the pump.
8441 2018-05-12 19:08:08 And the mayo is basically oil with raw eggs
8442 2018-05-12 19:08:01 Ahh perfect day for baby oil and wife beaters

8448 2018-05-12 19:07:03 I was going to change the oil in the lawnmower, but apparently fall 2017 Phil had the foresight to do it.

8450 2018-05-12 19:06:14 Blue cheese is a cheese. You can use it to make a salad dressing but you take some risks. There is no “ranch cheese” or “thousand island” or French or Russian or oil & vinegar cheese. I like it straight on a burger or roast beef sandwich. Also straight for salad. No contaminants
8451 2018-05-12 19:06:10 Literally has nothing to do with a vegan diet. The majority of EVERYTHING contains palm oil because it is cheaper for companies to produce. You use soap? Hypocrite.
8452 2018-05-12 19:05:30 Whoever made that baby oil gets off your fake tan lied and I am disappointed I’ve just spent 30 mins sat in oil for it to not work

8454 2018-05-12 19:05:27 Is $100 oil on its way back? Bank of America thinks so.
The bank's analysts wrote Thursday that collapsing oil production in Venezuela and potential export disruptions in Iran could push the price of Brent crude as high as $100 per barrel in 2019.#i3e

8456 2018-05-12 19:05:19 Governments don't control oil and gas prices. Klein was lucky enough to have $14 natural gas to balance the books. Alberta credit would have downgraded under the PC government had the NDP not won. At the end of the day we have to pay for what we use. Albertans don't get that.
8457 2018-05-12 19:05:17 And what currency will the UK use when the pound falls when it does not have Scottish oil to keep it afloat. What does England actually sell. Scotland has a lot to sell to the world.
8458 2018-05-12 19:05:06 After a month of using Jamaican black castor oil to no avail, I’ve accepted that beard life isn’t for me. 
8459 2018-05-12 19:05:03 I’m gonna be nice, change the oil give them a clean, never ever get them to dream or have a memory trap them in a world to awake ... should be just fine 
8460 2018-05-12 19:04:58 And I have great respect for Frances O'Grady. I think pouring oil on troubled water does not constitute lying; it's acting in the interests of party unity which I very much welcome.
8461 2018-05-12 19:04:56 Oil 
8462 2018-05-12 19:04:46 It's true! That is the reason that we give it to our elderly people with alzheimer in  our country. also with other diseases it helps. Mostly it is oil drops or tea.
8463 2018-05-12 19:04:40 Lol the vast majority of the oil used in the us is produced here. I knew that. Your graph was pointless is what I've been explaining...you tryna downplay Persian Gulf oil exports and the importance of the security regime in the region is what's crazy to me.
8464 2018-05-12 19:04:33 vape oil. Please I must see
8465 2018-05-12 19:04:29 You tried CBD oil yet?? Xx

8467 2018-05-12 19:04:16 Our Navarra crianza is not indicative of partisan-ship.  We have  italian prosciutto, irish bread, hummus and greek olive oil on the go
8468 2018-05-12 19:04:08 Some issues don't correlate well with left vs. right, e.g. climate change in countries without strong oil industries to buy off the right.
8469 2018-05-12 19:03:50 Though, I'm thinking of putting shelf paper in the spice cabinet of our new house because vanilla and olive oil always leak a little.
8470 2018-05-12 19:03:28 it was okay when oil prices were strong. When they dropped, yeah wrong alliance.
8471 2018-05-12 19:03:28 Actually the Russian, Qatari and iranian propagandists US was complaining that cheap oil was a "Saudi conspiracy to kill the US fracking revolution"! Higher oil prices can only boost US domestic production/market share = long term supply/price stability
8472 2018-05-12 19:03:16 I won’t be signing anything like that. Gas and oil industry would be a boom to our economy and create many good paying jobs.
8473 2018-05-12 19:03:15 Great appearance!  That said, don't eat at the same restaurant twice. Putin owe Trump a favor after increasing oil prices by exiting the Iran deal.
8474 2018-05-12 19:03:10 I think in the long term the gas market will converge with the oil market at the 'upper bound' price level at which heat/cooling demand gets destroyed. But we'll see boom/bust along the way
8475 2018-05-12 19:02:49 Yes, you’ve gotta keep spraying it with oil spray. But it’s good
8476 2018-05-12 19:02:44 within the past 12 months. That route was all about business class tix for energy related activities. When oil prices dropped, it started to struggle.

Avoid sugary beverages such as Soda & others..
 Reduce the amount of Carbs especially refined Carbs
 Cook with better oils such Olive and Grapeseed oil 
Sleep at least 6-10 hours
8478 2018-05-12 19:02:25 Did you miss the global drop in oil prices?   That cost oil jobs.

8484 2018-05-12 19:01:29 because the point's been proven that the vast majority of the oil used today in the Americas is also produced in the Americas. so your initial point was wrong and now you're drawing at other shit to continue to punch home that you were just wrong.

8500 2018-05-12 19:00:17 Eggs+butter (and/or cheese)>>eggs+olive oil

When that egg albumin absorbs that butter and salt and pepper, there ain't anything like it.
8501 2018-05-12 19:00:15 Yea, something about being legal and following the law makes you superior in many ways to lawbreakers and ppl ignoring them for own gains

8510 2018-05-12 18:59:58 I will need wiring dipped in oil  after trying this, my developer just left the job
8511 2018-05-12 18:59:52 iconic
8512 2018-05-12 18:59:39 I can’t even get an oil change without people bothering me.. this why I hate going places alone.
8513 2018-05-12 18:59:25 Are you serious? Russia is one of the key trading partners of the Ayatollahs that rely on Iran oil revenue to pay Russia for their purchases, specially energy technology and weapons. E.g. Nearly 100% of post-1979 power plants are Russian designed+made/?+installed
8514 2018-05-12 18:59:18 Wisdom of twitter - Triumph hasn't turned over for two years. What steps do I need to take to get it back up and running? Turn it over with no spark to get oil in ?
8515 2018-05-12 18:59:17 I guess no one told you how the commodities market works.  POTUS has no control over global oil supply.  You want cheap gas? Get Maduro out of Venezuela. Or do you like seeing a working model of socialism in action?
8516 2018-05-12 18:59:02 You're kidding. They've successfully defied US on Cuba for decades, and preparing for more since last year. Large items (airplane sales, oil fields development) will be more difficult, but don't underestimate their anger at Trump ignorant attempt to dictate EU foreign policy,

8519 2018-05-12 18:58:32 Technically, it isn't waterboarding if you use motor oil
8520 2018-05-12 18:58:29 Oh crap no oil and you have blown the bloody doors off!
8521 2018-05-12 18:57:52 I so would love to cover ur gorgeous body in baby oil
8522 2018-05-12 18:57:10 You think this is the first time gas prices have gone above $3/gal? Fair warning...if you want argue oil & gas prices, you’re steering into my professional arena. Prices are a global reflection, mostly Saudis and OPEC.
8523 2018-05-12 18:56:57 oil, their type of gvt and most of all innovation beyond anything we have ever seen and chamisa's innovation is blunt lies
8524 2018-05-12 18:56:56 Still need to process the materials for the batteries with coal and oil
8525 2018-05-12 18:56:51 Oil is the rarest known substance in the Universe.
8526 2018-05-12 18:56:50 I avoid the tube and him. But that moonbeam reflects so much. He must be using Murphy's oil! LMAO
8527 2018-05-12 18:56:33 A entire land war....was fought to ensure the flow of oil from the Persian Gulf because of any nation cuts off the crude supply of oil from that region the western world stops. Iran knows this, Iraq knew this hence the 1991 invasion. So for you to put this fluke ass graph up here
8528 2018-05-12 18:56:32 You mean 15 years after Iraq’s invasion by UK?

Btw how’s the oil business in Iraq?BP gets enough?
8529 2018-05-12 18:56:30 There is no benefit for west with a instable middle east and thats the last thing your prisedent wants. in fact islamic regime makes here instable and spend our money(oil money and taxes) to eqiup Revolutionary gaurd and their assets for bringing a new war to middle east
8530 2018-05-12 18:56:30 Toen en nu: Midnight Oil. Maar daarna Toto en George Michael. (Deze liedjes van ze dus.)
8531 2018-05-12 18:56:27 What does that mean? Dumb comment
8532 2018-05-12 18:56:23 He's moving against EMV companies so Oil companies can make more money from gas guzzling automobiles.

8535 2018-05-12 18:55:46 Iv got oil colors too that I never used .. want copic?? Or even pencil colors I rarely use them and I wanna try them as well 
8536 2018-05-12 18:55:41 I wish I could get my oil changed without the workers trying to shove $500 worth of extra services down my throat
8537 2018-05-12 18:55:37 My dad checked my car oil, got my brakes fixed, cleaned my car, and got me some gas this morning  definitely a real one
8538 2018-05-12 18:55:28 The tar-sands activists are not interested in whether the Athabasca oil sands are no longer the dirty oil of pre-2000. Had they been in charge they would have shut down production that has enabled technology advances 2 B financed. For them the "tar sands" is a fundraising tool
8539 2018-05-12 18:55:17 Just used a paper towel and some cooking oil and max heat.
8540 2018-05-12 18:55:06 Getting my baby “ Xzala “ oil changed today 
8541 2018-05-12 18:55:04 I've got oil colors here if needed 
8542 2018-05-12 18:54:53 Sorry, what's the engine oil for
8543 2018-05-12 18:54:34 Why does everyone here drink olive oil instead of water
8544 2018-05-12 18:54:32 Also that graph is cool but here's why my point matters: yes Africa or Canada or other nations may make up a percentage of US oils exports/imports but the First Gulf War (War on Terror by extension) was fought to protect that SA and Kuwait and oil/security interest in the ME
8545 2018-05-12 18:54:25 Look at that picture...Liver spots, no lips, and he needs some avocado oil to moisture his skin.  No wonder he is bitter.  A "casket ready" moment.
8546 2018-05-12 18:54:25 Just for the information of all concerned, the title of my LLM dissertation from the Aberdeen Business School in 2015 was "An Appropriate Taxation Regime for a Mature Oil Province in a Period of Low Oil Prices - the Challenge for Trinidad and Tobago"
8547 2018-05-12 18:54:06 Update: Burse is quickly fading thanks to an essential oil tester at my favorite shop in town today.

Pretty sure it was caused by someone grabbing me considering that other's said it looked like a thumbprint.

8550 2018-05-12 18:53:09 Yes, of course she said that. There is substantial disagreement within Labour powers (TUC, MPs, Lords, Momentum) as to how to proceed. She is pouring oil on troubled waters. I like that she's doing it but the waters are nonetheless troubled.
8551 2018-05-12 18:53:02 Just poured olive oil into my gin and tonic #winning
8552 2018-05-12 18:52:38 Also rode in the front seat of a police officer’s car last night because my car tried saying I had no oil when I just got an oil change

8554 2018-05-12 18:52:35 Oil and water cant mix.... it's best to find your type
8555 2018-05-12 18:52:25 it's actually for oil for wax only, i highly recommend getting two different vapes for herb and oil, the performance will be much better with each because combo units aren't that awesome yet
8556 2018-05-12 18:52:24 Because it's time to oil them up #boblennon
8557 2018-05-12 18:52:08 They were not a threat until we quit the agreement. This is a manufactured conflict waged by three countries to prop up oil prices and supply for Russia. Not to mention $ for defense contractors.
8558 2018-05-12 18:52:07 Your wind and solar projects require oil and gas to construct unless your windmills look like the ones in Holland. But probably not the case there Professor is it. Please respond with smoke signals because your Twitter device is made from petroleum  products as well
8559 2018-05-12 18:52:01 Did you have to season it with oil first? Mine you had to
8560 2018-05-12 18:51:34 Cracking Supper the night: Tagliata di Manzo. Way simpler than the fancy name sounds. Rare fillet of beef rubbed with herbs and olive oil, sliced on a bed of rocket, cherry tomatoes and Parmesan shavings. A wee glass of red to wash it down. Fiiiiiiiine!
8561 2018-05-12 18:51:28 Sir, 
In one of our video,  you have mention that your success ratio in crude oil trading is more than 90%.
Can u pls share chart analysis for crude oil. 
How you are taking trade on crude oil & which tool you are using for crude oil trading....
8562 2018-05-12 18:51:24 yeah, those words and college graduate are like oil and water.  the letters would just slide off the mortarboards and fall to the ground in a big pathetic heap.
8563 2018-05-12 18:51:11 It might backfire on the Coiffured Sex Pest, since a hike in the price of oil will be a gift to the Maduro regime in Venezuela --, and, of course, Putin.
8564 2018-05-12 18:51:10 Jab tak oil nahi nikla kuj nahi bana tha chande pe Ji raha tha Saudia
8565 2018-05-12 18:51:06 “In every measurable way..”? Why not list 3 of those measurable ways presumably due to Trump and GOP? Enormous tax breaks for the rich? Unemployment that Obama brought down from 10% to 4.9% in 2017? Gasoline and heating oil going up? All environmental protections destroyed?

8568 2018-05-12 18:50:44 I can’t get over how many times she “demands” things in the article. What an entitled waste of (a lot of) space
8569 2018-05-12 18:50:28 @wahaca great that you've got a vegan menu but why does most of it have ingredients that are fried in the same oil as meat products?
8570 2018-05-12 18:50:26 I haven’t paid $50 for a tank of gas in years but i guess that’s what happens when you heavily sanction the second largest oil exporter in the world
8571 2018-05-12 18:50:11 do you want to read the graph again? lmao. feel like i'm arguing with a wall. 

3/4 of the oil yall use was either produced at home or imported from Canada, Mexico or Venezuela. 

next, theres no way that any of those things i listed is helping me genocide&land grabs dont help me
8572 2018-05-12 18:49:37 you know when you watch a pot boil, and the water boils in certain spots, and the bubbles rise?
same exact thing, except with oil.
and what you're seeing is the heat, not bubbles.
8573 2018-05-12 18:49:37 how does he even have that much money to give? his whole yt channel is him just giving money. dude prolly got an oil well in his backyard

8579 2018-05-12 18:49:07 Cod liver oil is the D E V I L 
8580 2018-05-12 18:49:00 Imagine the past wars fought over oil? Now imagine water being an even more finite resource and how it ranks on Maslow hierarchy of needs. Talk about chaos at a level unknown to man.
8581 2018-05-12 18:48:57 @marksandspencer consumers want transparency and traceability.  We want to be able to look at a product and know what is in it. Whether that's free range eggs or sustainable palm oil.
8582 2018-05-12 18:48:56 OiIwa?? Oil wa?? ???? what is that?
8583 2018-05-12 18:48:21 Lot of oil in PB.. I have to control myself sometimes or I get poopy 
8584 2018-05-12 18:48:20 Asked my mom to oil my scalp and she was so excited because she doesn’t get to play in my hair anymore lol

And I could never understand why

8588 2018-05-12 18:47:15 There is a direct causal link of oil & gas wastewater injection to OK quakes. And it’s definitively not the other way around.  USGS has made that clear.  The energy industry concurs and has changed their practices on injection.  Even Energy in Depth couldn’t fully deny it above.
8589 2018-05-12 18:47:11 Yeah but they all like the prostitute themselves for those Arab oil dollars

8592 2018-05-12 18:46:51 This is the #1 issue for me. No. No. No oil drilling off the coast of OC. Can you imagine Laguna with oil rigs. Neither can I. This is why we must #Flipthe45th! #CA45 (And shame on @MimiWaltersCA!)
8593 2018-05-12 18:46:42 Painted all the skirting boards in the hall for my mum, in oil based eggshell and who's currently clattering around it with a hoover. A hoover that now looks like John Squire owns it.

8595 2018-05-12 18:46:28 Only a quarter.  And if you don't vote their way, Oil gets cut off.

8597 2018-05-12 18:46:14 Hahaha. And how was the dam built, a herd of Beavers. And how is that car built, and I’m sure it’s a cord that is used to charge that car. Maybe one day unicorn farts will build your Utopia oil free world. Until then keep on using oil products telling everyone to stop using them
8598 2018-05-12 18:46:14 Lives that would not be possible without fossil fuels? Are U referring to Oil, Deisel, Gas, & Coal? What lives are U referring to Joe, that could not survive using clean alternative fuels like Solar, Wind, Water, Steam..etc..instead of human killing & earth killing Fossil Fuels?

8601 2018-05-12 18:45:56 It frustrates me when upper management argues with me about stuff I am 100 percent right on. If you can’t tell the different between a NPST straight joint and integral straight joint get out of the oil field 
8602 2018-05-12 18:45:55 Aww....hope it goes smoothly and quickly, and that Earth, Wind, and Oil (the tribute act for Earth, Wind, and Fire) don't want their tour case back while you're gone

 It would certainly make it easier for the locals that only change one letter when pronouncing both
8606 2018-05-12 18:45:15 I don't have break in oil and not gonna rip it till its retuned so next week maybe
8607 2018-05-12 18:45:07 También decir que el planteamiento de los resultados da muy buena vista al segundo trimestre y al año en general y más si siguen las subidas del OIL o se estabiliza y los aranceles desaparecen.

Esperemos celebrar pronto los 0,5/0,6€!!!

Un saludo.
8608 2018-05-12 18:45:00 Don’t forget the 3 olive oil jars that we got from Sardinia free. I sold them at £1 each. #delboy
8609 2018-05-12 18:44:50 Whenever I get my oil changed I feel like such an adult and kinda done adulting for a week or so. Like I did the minimum I should do. Let’s call it done.
8610 2018-05-12 18:44:47 Not really. Premise: western society and the larger global society/economy is run by a cheap efficient supply of crude oil which is maintained by various security alliances..Saudi/Israel/and the US alliance in the ME is vital to the continued prosperity of the First World
8611 2018-05-12 18:44:43 I seriously hate getting an oil change. Shit takes forever
8612 2018-05-12 18:44:37 You’re telling me that there’s no lotion in Tinsley’s hotel/apartment room? Thank goodness her “stylist” had a massive bottle of Nivea Vanilla and Almond Oil Infused Lotion handy! Definitely not a product placement, right? #RHONY

At least the useless shit they’re hawking has a clear purpose, the Essential Oils idiots LEGITIMATELY believe that those bottles of glorified vegetable oil have “secret healing powers” and that doctors “don’t want you to know”.

8631 2018-05-12 18:42:27 when you consider iran's oil wealth and young educated work force versus the stagnancy of north korea; and also consider with iran we had the cooperation of our european partners vs. north korea's where the only leverage is china. there is no way this is a better deal.

8643 2018-05-12 18:41:11 So, no taxpayer funding like oil, but ethanol has the subsidy?! E0 sales are on the rise. Why people talking a mandate is comical, just don’t understand the law. More people that use E15 and E85, the more that can use E0.

8647 2018-05-12 18:40:16 Right now I don't do business with shops that only let me book appointments over the phone. Whether it's a restaurant, a hair cut, oil change, etc., because I hate spelling my name and email over the phone. This could change that, and give more business to non-online shops

8649 2018-05-12 18:40:08 All was fine until you meddled. Now oil prices skyrocketing which effects everything from gas to food & other essentials. This after your tax scam. How much oil stock do you & your cronies own?
8650 2018-05-12 18:40:05 Don’t you think Canada should have just innovated away from oil sands (worse for the environment and relatively poor economics) toward shale and/or alternative energy? IMHO, Al Gore is actually pretty moderate and not an extremist. Grow up, Brett.

8653 2018-05-12 18:39:40 trump breached the Iran contract. They were complying. Kim & other world leaders now know for sure, trump's word is no good. He's reneged on deals/contracts his entire adult life. What he's trying to do is set the stage to start a war with Iran to gain control of their oil.

8655 2018-05-12 18:39:22 2). The recipe for the Holy oil comes down from the Hebrew and Judaic versions as the same recipe. It is: 1 c virgin olive oil, 1/4 oz ground cannabis buds, 30 drops of myrrh oil, 30 drops cinnamon bark oil & 15 drops cinnamon leaf oil. Place them in a double broiler and ......
8656 2018-05-12 18:39:20 If you really want natural products nowadays, DIY is your best bet. Toothpaste is as simple as mixing coconut oil, baking soda, and some flavoring extract. Deodorant has a bunch of recipes online that are all simple, just be aware that nothing will perform like alum based.

8663 2018-05-12 18:38:45 I lived through the 70s, the Carter malaise, the oil embargoes, the Shah, etc.

Luckily I have you here to explain it to me.

You apparently have no clue.

I know we aren't pure and holy. For example, we just recently gave $150 billion to the world's largest sponsor of terror.
8664 2018-05-12 18:38:38 BBC had a Doco during the week showing corpos clearing Borneo's rain forest for palm oil plantations and displacing orangutans in the process truly heart breaking stuff all so the western world can enjoy cheap snacks.
8665 2018-05-12 18:38:32 Yes and pumping oil as we speak. We also know that there are massive reserves between Lewis and Rockall out on the continental shelf. Further reserves are also in the Clyde basin. Yet they tell the gullible&ill informed it's running out (30 years) and has been since we found it.

8669 2018-05-12 18:37:54 • mix a few drops of tea tree oil to make your hair silky and shiny 

• condition your hair , then wash it, and than condition again 

• was your face with cold in the sink, instead of in the shower because your pores will open  
8670 2018-05-12 18:37:34 To my knowledge, we are the only ones that do the embedded metal. Still, the fake oil cans, signage, cast iron, etc. being reproduced today will make it harder to discern historic dates for a site.
8671 2018-05-12 18:37:20 The Word of God is a two-edged sword; the Justice of the OT and the Mercy of the NT. The two olivetrees in the heavenly sanctuary, giving the oil to keep the lampstand burning in the order of Melchizedec, the priesthood of Christ.
8672 2018-05-12 18:37:16 Isn’t this treason ?   The uk only wants the Iran deal so they can make money off oil and other trade.  So now which party is all in it for oil ??

8676 2018-05-12 18:36:52 Yo aparte de mirar los fundamentales,lo comparo con las  del OIL y de otras comparables del sector como Tubacex y se ve relación en las caidas y subidas y ahora mismo un descuadre,mientras esta cae(Teniendo una mejoría),lo demás sube y eso me hace ser optimista a C/M plazo
8677 2018-05-12 18:36:51 On the issue of equipping hospitals with necessary equipment, the government is going to enter into a partnership with General Electric, an American company that we are dealing with in the oil sector. It also manufactures medical equipment and will supply these at a lower cost.

8681 2018-05-12 18:36:27 oh, you can easily make this with smoked fish. you just cook up onions, garlic, tomato, habañero, broth (maggi + water for you, i guess), throw in beans and green plantain, salt to taste. depending on where you are, you can use coconut oil to fry up the sofrito
8682 2018-05-12 18:36:11 1) The Holy oil is the physical miracle used by Jesus to heal the sick. Jesus commanded his disciples to give it to the sick.  It is spoken of many times in the Old Testament, but not at all in the New testament. Why do preachers tell us to ignore the Old Testament? Puppets?
8683 2018-05-12 18:36:02 I have a shirt that got oil on it, and I didn’t notice until after I washed it. Treated with Dawn the 2nd time - didn’t help. I’m thinking of dousing the whole thing in oil, then washing again. 
8684 2018-05-12 18:35:58 Please stop. Soca music is a reflection of carnival/calypso. It resonates on the actual  slave history of each island marching, playing in paint and oil in celebration of a good  harvest season. Hence why Barbados has “Crop Over” and Trinidad has “Trinidad Carnival”.

8691 2018-05-12 18:34:57 They do for cancer, cannabis oil there’s multiple surveys and research out there that shows the effects of it.
8692 2018-05-12 18:34:35 Or dying of thirst. The wars for oil, will be child’s play, compared to when the wars for fresh water ramp up. The CIA is undoubtedly already got us into the beginnings of the wars, laid the groundwork, it’s just not noticeable yet.
8693 2018-05-12 18:34:27 That is exactly what is going on. Trump planned leaving the JCPOA the moment he took office. For one, war in the ME destabilizes oil prices, and Iran was allowed unrestricted oil exports under the deal. When it ends, they will be restricted on oil exports again by OPEC.
8694 2018-05-12 18:34:14 @prabablyprab put me onto argan oil for the skin & my life hasn’t been the same. 
8695 2018-05-12 18:34:10 I got oil from fried fish on a Cubs shirt as a matter of fact. Used Dawn dish soap got it wet rubbed some into the stain. Wash like normal... came right out. Can't even tell.
8696 2018-05-12 18:34:08 @drsanjaygupta I was diagnosed schizophrenic in 2001. In 2004 I kept hearing the voices saying Gupta over and over. Last year I was able to quit perphenazine with cbd oil. I saw your report on CNN and now I know what Gupta means.
8697 2018-05-12 18:33:40 Not disagreeing on her being a monster, but didn't you vote FOR pretty much EVERY military action since you've been in office? Putting MILLIONS of  lives in the position of kill/be killed/become POWs for the benefit of defense/oil companies? 

How's that any different?
8698 2018-05-12 18:33:37 lol I only value Saudi Arabia because of the US/Saudi strategic relationship over oil and collective security in the Middle East. Morally do I side with them? No. They the major reason for the increase in fundamentalism/destabilization in the ME soooo I get you
8699 2018-05-12 18:33:32 Coldplay was on in both stores I’ve been in today, three people have commented on my Bama shirt, I got my oil changed, and I’m going to the BBQ Festival tonight...what a good day
8700 2018-05-12 18:33:17 Well we have had massive oil leaks and SEPA reports on radioactive waste issues with the Trident program at both Faslane and Coulport. SEPA were also not reported on breaches by the MOD.
8701 2018-05-12 18:33:01 @seanhannity If they open up the oil reserves that’s a good thing.Don’t worry too much about the future our enemies will attack our oil reserves so start using some of that oil to bring the prices down our country is filled with oil believe me
8702 2018-05-12 18:32:32 They are NOT devout. They are false if they believe for one second the Buffoon in Chief is “godly”. He’s a crook and a charlatan...and very poor snake oil salesman.
8703 2018-05-12 18:32:31 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
8704 2018-05-12 18:32:18 Amazing police depts still finding recruits. 
Have great respect for LE, would be extremely low on career choice given liability it carries
8705 2018-05-12 18:32:18 Moved from 11.5 unemp. To 4.2. Trump moved from 4.2 to 3.9 yep great huge strides. Keep watching, trade is screwed, our farmers are screwed. Oil going up, interest rates, food will get higher. We will have a recession then most likely a full blown depression. 
He is a disaster.
8706 2018-05-12 18:32:05 My man changed my tires for me today and his brother changed my oil while I was back at the tire shop with their youngest brother taking charge for their father so he could go to an auction. I’m lovin’ my life hard core

8710 2018-05-12 18:31:32 My hair is so pretty now  that oil treatment got me right 
8711 2018-05-12 18:31:31 @seanhannity If we stop buying oil from overseas for at least a year oil prices would drop drastically that’s not rocket science to figure out.There is no other way to bring gas and oil prices down.believe me.I’m 63 years old I’ve been around.make it happen. Just ask Jim Cramer
8712 2018-05-12 18:31:30 It’s addictive...I “oil” my whole family! Just realized that sounds really bad 
8713 2018-05-12 18:31:22 เข้มม
8714 2018-05-12 18:31:13 Russia and China are going to get rich because we left. Now that America is our, Iran can deal oil with Russia and China again. We’re going to pay a lot more but they’re going to make bank.

8719 2018-05-12 18:30:48 I didn’t pretreat this dress that had oil stains on it before I washed it. Now even though I washed it, the oil stains are etched. Anybody have any idea on how to fix this? Or is it too late?
8720 2018-05-12 18:30:41 Nah Jan. He's nothing more than a huckster... a snake oil salesman.

8729 2018-05-12 18:30:20 @IAR_updates I just finished watching BBC's #RedApe programme.  I've just sent an email to the UK Govenment DEFRA on what are they doing to get sustainable palm oil products in our supermarkets, and also how are they communicating with Indonesia to save the Orangutan.

8736 2018-05-12 18:29:59 You think too highly of SA’s status trust me. There’s a reason that country is going broke even though they have all that oil and all those resources. You understand the basics and I really do respect that but it’s a lot deeper than you think.

8738 2018-05-12 18:29:37 We should NOT salvage this deal Guy! Why would we support a vicious regime by doing this. Did you ever ask yourself why Iran would need any nucleair power at all? You fool! They have more oil than they can ever spend! Why would they need a nucl plant? You EU guys are grazy!!!!!!!
8739 2018-05-12 18:29:33 @DeepakChopra thanks for the wealth of information in “the healing self”. Please share views on avocado oil vs. Olive oil.
8740 2018-05-12 18:29:26 Gas prices on the rise because of tearing up the Iran agreement.  This doesn't help America at all.  Only makes those oil companies richer, and makes more of us poorer.
8741 2018-05-12 18:29:24 What’s frustrating is the Iran sanctions will likely allow them to restart their oil wells and paper over their shit economy long enough for them to make even dumber choices
8742 2018-05-12 18:29:07 @secupp Staunch Republican constituencies like guns & tobacco sure result in a lot of death, don’t they?

Not to mention oil, which imperils the whole planet.

But that’s OK, because Republicans also don’t believe everyone should have health care!

8764 2018-05-12 18:26:05 Thank you!! I started applying a peppermint, grapeseed, tea tree, and olive oil mix last week to my scalp. I'll start doing the massages too.  How often did you apply oil and massage?
8765 2018-05-12 18:25:57 This is like an obese person blaming a doctor for not curing their diabetes or blaming the mechanic for the car engine failing when you’ve never changed the oil.  Prevention dude.  Prevention!!!!
8766 2018-05-12 18:25:34 I googled beard oil 

It’s a thing I just might try - every time I go through itchy phase, I end up shaving or taking it down to stub...

8768 2018-05-12 18:25:19 i'm not sure then. olive oil is totally diff than coconut oil, it's not hard like coconut. my hair needs oil to grow
8769 2018-05-12 18:25:19 The withdrawal from the agreement would have been marginally more acceptable had it waited till after the summer hike in gas prices. Now it appears (and probably is) a gift to DJT's friends in the oil industry.
8770 2018-05-12 18:25:16 Thoda anti-incumbancy dikh raha hai mujhe. Especially with rising oil prices & disappointing budget. If BJP doesn't do well in Kar, that would be the second election after Gujarat where they would've faltered. With states like 36garh and Raj coming up, it could be tough for BJP!
8771 2018-05-12 18:25:14 I think Japan or China opened up a solar  panel plant here in US. We r doing clean coal & shipping it to China. China doesn't make clean coal. If we get our oil here we could stop being dependent on others.
8772 2018-05-12 18:25:07 Cook the steak very quickly in a liberal amount of butter. If you have a hard time not burning butter, a little sunflower oil will help you out. Don’t overcook them!

While the steaks rest drop the onions in the pan, add a bit more salt and cook them in that butter. Top steaks.

8783 2018-05-12 18:23:28 The reality: The best thing to happen for the Middle East is to move from a primary Crude producer to a supplier of processed Oil and Gas products, maximize its refining, processing, and secondary products ss a REGION, and to maximize efficiency to produce more aggregate wealth.
8784 2018-05-12 18:23:23 The taste thing could be used as a loose analogy if you said there are a range of tastes humans enjoy. If you made oil tasting ice cream, 99.9% of humans would dislike it. If you made it out of actual battery acid, it would be toxic and incompatible.
8785 2018-05-12 18:23:12 I spilt peppermint essential oil on my bbq chips and you best believe I am still eating them

8791 2018-05-12 18:22:21 Well said. I have someone very close to me with cancer and she is on cannabis oil. There is no THC in it. She doesn't feel any different when she takes it. Some people believe it can help cure some cancers. So why not let people try? Time to leaglize it.
8792 2018-05-12 18:22:18 Thank you for sharing this! Palm oil is really bad for the environment and people who live in areas that are cleared for these plantations.

8798 2018-05-12 18:21:20 You’re an idiot.  You should go read up on how Norway invested in the early days of oil discovery and production.  Then compare with Ven.  And, no - I’m not saying Ven had exactly the same policies nor am I saying that Chavez didn’t make mistakes.

8805 2018-05-12 18:19:58 Forget being the #1 anything, America only gets 8-9% of its oil from Saudi Arabia. Canada literally gives us twice that amount. Please bro read more before you talk about middle eastern politics.

8807 2018-05-12 18:19:49 So let me get this straight leaving the Iran deal is bad? Our middle East allies love it, Israel with most to lose is throwing a party, Iran is burning flags and firing rockets, and Europe is made it can't buy cheap oil and gas.
8808 2018-05-12 18:19:37 I've had the original Old Engine Oil and absolutely loved it.  I'll have to keep my eyes open for the reserve. Sounds amazing. How do you feel about beers infused with chili peppers?  I had one recently called Hellzapoppin' by Yeastie Boys. Loved it...

8820 2018-05-12 18:18:10 You do know that money was their money not ours right? We froze their bank accounts, an then unfroze them as part of the agreement. Ending the deal was stupid and will benefit China an Russia with oil. Iran is staying in the agreement with our allies. We lose
8821 2018-05-12 18:17:49 Loved my late dad's blue Allegro! It actually handled quite well but drank litres of oil for no obvious reason. Known in the family, slightly unfairly, as the All Aggro.
8822 2018-05-12 18:17:44 im a busy mom and i dont have time to lotion my ass. so i read on pinterest you should put coconut oil on your toilet seat to save time but i slipped off the toilet seat and was trapped between the wall and the toilet for hours until my son B'Arthlythgus finally saved me
8823 2018-05-12 18:17:44 No his not, his used Arsenal as surity on a down payment to part fund the purchase of a ranch, how is that as bad as having Russian oil money that should be in a country that has terrible conditions for its people, he owns 70% it’s up to him what he does with it, mans not silly
8824 2018-05-12 18:17:29 Ugh. I’m gonna be late to my hair appt cause I gotta get a stupid oil change.

8827 2018-05-12 18:16:47 What’s the perspective compared with the damage caused by the dairy industry, just to name one sector? There are parallels emerging from the Agricultural industry as veganism becomes popular, with that of the oil industry with the spread of alternative fuels.
8828 2018-05-12 18:16:42 "Trump’s move comes as oil company deals have come under intense scrutiny. Late last year, Russia sold a 19.5% stake in its giant oil company Rosneft, but the full identities of those who bought it are unknown."

8833 2018-05-12 18:15:37 I wonder why did @JustinWelby meet the rogue 
Saudi leader, may be he still has oil shares. I was really disappointed a person who should be fighting for human rights in Saudi, bowing to that corrupt leader. This shows even holy people will bow to money

8836 2018-05-12 18:15:19 In case you need a refresher: in Operation Ajax (~1953?) we overthrew their democratically elected government to keep them from auditing the financials of an oil company.

Then, we sold weapons to the anti democratic regime in Iran to fund death squads in El Salvador.
8837 2018-05-12 18:15:18 Except it has. You blob.the gov spent the last decade redistributing the state owned oil company's wealth to the peasants as opposed to investing in plant and equipment like Norway had. You need to file a lawsuit against the school you went to for permentantly damaging your brain

From the hitch of their truck a pair of ornamental testicles hung.
I felt like asking them if that meant that they were gay.

8887 2018-05-12 18:09:50 Well, because we owe China trillions, Russia is insulated because of their oil: therefore we tax our own citizens to the wall, and therefore, have sell arms to both sides of conflicts we create.

8905 2018-05-12 18:07:27 FYI; the world oligarchy has been hijacked by Islamic oriented oil baron followers. They have bought enuf stock in #ComericaBank(since 2004) to make decisions on laws and elections. Comerica carries the ownership paper on America. A paper owned by (kidnapped) B. W. Kirchoff.

8926 2018-05-12 18:04:59 Is CDB oil legal where you live? They sell it over the counter a drug stores here in Georgia. It doesn’t get you high it just stops seizures.
8927 2018-05-12 18:04:56 It's shameful especially since we have our own oil.

8953 2018-05-12 18:01:26 They based that fund on Alberta's Heritage Fund but kept investing in it whereas Alberta didn't.
I also compare the UK and Norway who drew from the same oil field. The UK cut taxes and "put money in people's pockets". Compare the countries today. Which approach worked better?

Welcome @realDonaldTrump. What is up.
We need to plunder Iran.
No, Trump. No. We need to save the Iranians from the ayatollahs.
Yes. Yes. But what I want to know is how we will split the oil.
8972 2018-05-12 17:58:14 Today’s gasoline would have the same outcome on older parts. It is not the same as it was 5 and 10 years ago, and not because of ethanol. Oil is refining less, dumping in more cheap components & boosting aromatics. All bad news for fuel parts. 2/2
8973 2018-05-12 17:57:57 Maybe it wasn’t a great idea to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal with one of our major oil exports because now I have to pay $50 to fill my tank I’m heated

8986 2018-05-12 17:56:41 I know!! I skipped sunblock today and went straight for the baby oil, hopefully that does the trick
8987 2018-05-12 17:56:37 Not needed, huh?! Oil is now being exported as quick as possible. What are you going to use? Ready to pay for it? Replace ethanol’s octane at $4-5/gallon and hold on! 1/2

9017 2018-05-12 17:52:02 Exactly. It’s not like the price of gold or the price of oil is tethered to the cost of drilling/mining. The cost to acquire the commodity only impacts the supply curve (not demand). Bitcoin has the extra layer of time, therefore the supply curve remains unchanged

9032 2018-05-12 17:50:22 In news you don't need. I ate marinated artichoke hearts and drank the oil because I'm constipated. #onbrand

9034 2018-05-12 17:50:14 I’m gonna do it the @GiGiHadid way. Leave coconut oil in my hair for 3 days. This better work.
9035 2018-05-12 17:50:13 I use butter or ghee or coconut oil. Saturated fats are so much more stable. The food cooks much better and it tastes better too.

9060 2018-05-12 17:46:15 They're the most LA thing ever - 
oil companies: "We want to build some artificial islands to extract oil please" 
City of Long Beach: "Ok, BUT MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A LAS VEGAS RESORT BECAUSE, VISITORS"
9061 2018-05-12 17:46:15 Should negotiate long term oil and gas supply at a cheap and fixed price.

9066 2018-05-12 17:45:52 Ethanol is not needed. No oil shortage now. I have seen multiple warnings over the years on different engines. The latest being a brand new Troy-Bilt push mower. In the past also reacted badly with rubber?
9067 2018-05-12 17:45:49 Gas prices are up because oil prices are rising based on increased demand and geopolitical conditions. A stock market correction of 10% is typical and nothing to worry about. Wages rose at the fastest annual pace since the recession. Impacts of tariffs are not known yet.

9071 2018-05-12 17:45:36 Ppl should be stripped of clearance when they leave. After an event, the smartest ppl in the country might figure out what I already know.

9073 2018-05-12 17:45:19 My bf decided to make sweet potato wedges, but needed instructions. Chop them into wedges then chuck em in a bowl with some oil and give it a stir. 

He’s cut thick slices of potato and coated each one in oil by hand... what the actual....
9074 2018-05-12 17:45:02 I’m amazed at the people who think he’s making a deal and is a good negotiator...he cant communicate, can’t plan, doesn’t know history. He won’t answer questions or explain his policies. He’s a con. He shows you that daily. Enjoy the gas and oil price increases, great deals!

9078 2018-05-12 17:44:25 For aftercare, try using a massage oil
9079 2018-05-12 17:43:59 When you see a Tweet about Finn Balor rainbow shirts, realize it was a RT by @bpal and then wonder when we're getting a Demon King oil.
9080 2018-05-12 17:43:55 Perfect. Just need some paprika, chilli powder, Olive oil and Worcester sauce. Mix them all together and roast in the oven on a low heat for about 45 - 60 mins 
9081 2018-05-12 17:43:48 Olive Oil could have swang it all, kicking in the Earth's core.

9091 2018-05-12 17:42:34 or is it because thats where the 5 isis leaders were hiding with US allowance, when iraq forces arrested them this week the pentagon lost a force to take the oil fields if the kurds defect and make alliance with iran and syria. plan B - Bring in US troops
9092 2018-05-12 17:42:28 These ppl retain clearances. Bad idea. No doubt still in contact with ppl at State. These parallel "negotiations" are dangerous. Illegal ?
9093 2018-05-12 17:42:27 Does the CBD oil actually work? Considering it.
9094 2018-05-12 17:42:20 I can't be this unlucky to be both allergic to tea tree oil and witch hazel no? what other natural astringent and acne soothing-clearing agent am I going to use then? this is so frustrating ugh this major acne breakout really gets me.

If you gave a fuck about becoming arsenal manager one day then you should have retired then became and Arsenal coach and worked your way up rather than jumping ship for oil money
9097 2018-05-12 17:42:01 #SaturdayMorning Took my @Toyota Corolla @Pennzoil for oil change. Afterward I’m told Check Engine light is still on. What could be happening??? #NeedanAnswer  @YouTube #WhatsHappening #cars #Auto
9098 2018-05-12 17:41:57 I agree. Even if it is olive oil, how can we be sure it’s not combined with seed oils! However, I purchased these for my husband, who is on the road a lot - and wants to avoid sugar (he normally fasts). We are right to question where our food comes from. 
9099 2018-05-12 17:41:51 Whatever man, quit being such a fun sponge... Just because our teams suck, doesn’t mean you have to take out the joy for other fans
9100 2018-05-12 17:41:46 Ironic turn of phrase considering Saddam’s forces set the Kuwaiti oil fields ablaze when he decided to attempt to nullify the existence another nation
9101 2018-05-12 17:41:42 he had 1 % share and he denounced it,Soma oil and gas was brought in by HSM and Omar abdirashid
9102 2018-05-12 17:41:35 Got a sandwhich with no oil and vinegar never again
9103 2018-05-12 17:41:32 Mosaddegh was the guy who nationalized oil there, yes.
But he wasn't Shah, and it wasn't our oil (Britain's) and our only involvement was at the request of the Brits.

How could that possibly indicate US invading? 

And I was referring to the revolution in the 70s.

9115 2018-05-12 17:40:00 Hope #Germany and #EU allied countries heed this call. I'm sure they can find other oil sources. Crisis like this will prompt innovations for alternative fuel and energy sources.
9116 2018-05-12 17:39:52 Ur explanation doesn't take into account Trump admin negotiations w Xi Jinping,China massing 10K's troops on border with N Korea,China building new bridges @ Yalu river 2 support threatened invasion, and cut in oil/food exports to N Korea, and Jong-un being summoned to Beijing
9117 2018-05-12 17:39:42 He did hit the tank. You can smell oil all over the neighborhood
9118 2018-05-12 17:39:40 I really want cannabis oil. But I’m not sure what for. What is it good for? (Don’t.)

9121 2018-05-12 17:38:54 Hi sweetie!  Just google ‘can coconut oil be applied to a dogs coat’,  and you’ll get the answer.  Then you can go and ‘correct’ your friend.  
9122 2018-05-12 17:38:46 Sorry, what was he doing in Iraq again? Not sure it was anything to do with your great country. Probably something to do with oil, more likely.
9123 2018-05-12 17:38:44 EVERYTHING currently using oil can (and will) be converted to renewables.
9124 2018-05-12 17:38:37 おやすみー！
9125 2018-05-12 17:38:28 WhaT exactly contributes to such a mess in a country that is rich in oil? Political corruption ,embezzelment, laziness of people?
9126 2018-05-12 17:38:26 Fine weather + baby oil (coconut oil works just fine) + bedroom + man all alone with a computer. You see where this is going?

9132 2018-05-12 17:37:30 Wake up. The Art of the Deal is to deal from a position of strength. Now US has no say. Mabey Trump should read his own book. But then his goal is profit from Saudi oil and increase US gas prices.

9136 2018-05-12 17:37:13 Well we’ll agree to disagree on that.

I don’t remember unfettered immigration. I don’t remember ANY intervention that would have diminished Canada as a nation.

I do remember defending Canadian interests abroad like our oil sands, our agriculture, and preserving our freedoms.
9137 2018-05-12 17:37:10 My car is powered by hydro dams. I understand you may have sniffed too much oil to understand this, but cars don’t need to be directly plugged to solar and wind to be powered by them.

9140 2018-05-12 17:36:12 Decent call. California is ripe for regime change and has oil as well. You should only feel guilty about the most recent Bourne film though.
9141 2018-05-12 17:36:06 Have contacted Warburtons, as just found a fruit loaf i eat has Palm Oil in it, as well as sun flower oil, WHY!! anyway on that case with the why with them, never had it before am sure we can survive without palm oil in our loafs 
9142 2018-05-12 17:36:01 Just ran into an acquaintance at the grocery store...then again in another aisle...followed by seeing them again in yet another area of the store....

So now I'm just waiting it out inside a display of motor oil.

9143 2018-05-12 17:35:59 If it weren’t for the oil fields, Muslims would be back to slave trading. That was their only source economy back in the days.
9144 2018-05-12 17:35:56 Some zealots believe that “clean” oil comes out of the ground ready to pour into their tanks. All oil, every single barrel, must be refined.

9157 2018-05-12 17:33:41 Caught up with #RedApe. Would be good if this doc can do for #palmoil what Blue Planet 2 did for plastics. Shop & manufacturer responses to my questions about palm oil in past few years have been disappointing & inadequate: have stopped using many brands as a result.

There's only two types.
The first understands that it's all a con and bullshits.
The second doesn't understand it and just bullshits.
9168 2018-05-12 17:32:10 Probably still holds security clearances and in contact with State Dept. Ppl should be stripped of clearance when they leave office.

9170 2018-05-12 17:32:09 Ah you see but here is where you are wrong.  Alberta will be *forced* to, by the Constitution and if necessary the army to ship its oil to BC but BC can, by established constitutional authority (1984 Strait of Georgia Reference) ban all oil shipping from its ports.

9173 2018-05-12 17:31:47 Love oil and smelling fresh 
9174 2018-05-12 17:31:11 Did you forget we don’t want oil Tankers sailing out of Vancouver? Must have had a brain fart too forget that lol

9176 2018-05-12 17:30:56 Purchased a car less than 6 months ago from @EASTERNMOTORS . Husband took car for oil change 152.00!!! Filthy air filter and cabin air filter. Told that they have NEVER been changed. Not cool to have to pay this out on a recent purchase!
9177 2018-05-12 17:30:47 #Trudeau said we have to phase out the oil sands. One reason he gave was"protecting FN communities." When BC & AB FN have an agreement to build a pipeline thru their territory, I blv the FN have a vested interest in protecting their environment bc they actually live there.
9178 2018-05-12 17:30:40 Pemex es lento y burocrático, no innova.

Cuando bajó el precio del crudo, decían que los productores de shale oil saldrían del mercado porque necesitaban un barril carísimo para que fueran rentables.

En cuestión de meses bajaron su costo de extracción vía automatización y TIs
9179 2018-05-12 17:30:31 Nationalizing an industry means seizing it for the state. When an American oil company goes in to an impoverished nation like Iran and invests billions to develop their oil industry, it's just stealing from them to nationalize it.
9180 2018-05-12 17:30:22 Process  of random and creations of plural ERC721 tokens needs high gas limit. Sorry for incoivinience.
however, it also adds the value to your crystal because gas is the limited resources like time, oil...
9181 2018-05-12 17:30:10 ทางใหม่ก็ดีนะ แต่แค่ยังไม่ชิน
9182 2018-05-12 17:30:02 にゃ。ごめん。
9183 2018-05-12 17:30:02 What is it with you and the idea that someone would someone quit politics forever over a line error?  Anyway he is likely correct as Alberta abandoned real oil revenues back in the 80s when it lowballed itself out of collecting royalties.
9184 2018-05-12 17:30:01 I was 14 and knew less than nothing but still sensed that it going to turn out badly for everyone involved except the higher-ups and that the Americans were being less than honest about their motives for invasion *cough* oil *cough*.
9185 2018-05-12 17:29:59 Better yet pay for my argan oil
9186 2018-05-12 17:29:58 Tea tree oil or hot salt water on a wee cotton pad / bud also helps!
9187 2018-05-12 17:29:56 I just spent $80 at the oil change place. Jeez
9188 2018-05-12 17:29:50 We have oil 
9189 2018-05-12 17:29:39 Thingspeak says your oil is low
9190 2018-05-12 17:29:24 Lol yup I’m going to get my oil change
9191 2018-05-12 17:29:19 I said it last week alresdy. Iran is all sbout oil.
9192 2018-05-12 17:29:07 I've painted a boatload of these. Wash them, put a clear sealer on first, then just paint over that. The sealer gives the mini some texture for the paint to grip onto. Otherwise the paint will pool off like water onto oil.
9193 2018-05-12 17:29:01 You're saying it's all about tax dollars? That seems pretty mercenary, not to say ignorant, since Canada gets tax dollars from oil and gas extraction (and "wastes" them in your words on wind and solar). 

Are you sure that's your best argument?
9194 2018-05-12 17:28:55 Exactly what we expected from Trudeau. Destroying the Canadian Energy industry has always been part of his agenda. People voted for that.  Canadian welfare & healthcare benefits are generous. People don’t need evil jobs in the oil & gas industry!
9195 2018-05-12 17:28:48 So i was in Walmart and got an oil diffuser. Can’t wait to get home and start using it.

9199 2018-05-12 17:28:12 Fucking love oil money me 
9200 2018-05-12 17:28:11 Isn't OK where all the earth quakes happen now because they sold out your state to oil & gas "fracking"?
9201 2018-05-12 17:28:05 1/2 Actually Darcie this would be the fault of the greens if they intervened now. The original royalty structure in regards to oil sands development was intentionally set up with the majority@of royalties to be paid in the future. This was done to allow companies
9202 2018-05-12 17:27:59 Better than an oil spill!
9203 2018-05-12 17:27:58 I believe the activities of yahoo boys has been damaging to     to other well meaning citizens like palm oil stain on the middle finger.

9205 2018-05-12 17:27:41 They always will attack you snow flakes . Mr president I'm asking you to look into high gas prices ct gone up a dollar already where paying 3.00 per gal from 2.20 per gal with all our oil how about America first other country second could you look into it please .
9206 2018-05-12 17:27:34 E no reach to argue. Ph get oil coys... You can see a 20smth year old pulling better mob doing legit job.

9208 2018-05-12 17:26:59 Been out of it all day. Took some cbd oil and went for a nap - slept three fucking hours xD Feel better now thought
9209 2018-05-12 17:26:49 Hey @realDonaldTrump you work for US, the citizens of this country. Not Israel, not Wall Street, not big pharma, not oil, not for your own interests. For us, the citizens.

9221 2018-05-12 17:25:09 I had to make some cinnamon infused oil but had a little too much to fill my storage bottle so I used the overflow for a hot oil treatment. Hair was smelling like big red gum.
9222 2018-05-12 17:25:06 After changing every single transport belt into express level, I really need to find a new way to use my stacked up lubricant before it goes waste and end up cracking heavy oil into light one...

take courage for the constancy of my own.

9248 2018-05-12 17:21:49 Iran doesn't have nuclear weapons, North Korea does. That is a big difference. The Iranians want nuclear power, probably so they can export more oil. The delay was meant to prove we could trust them, and if needed negotiate a new deal then. DPRK has a lower bar to renucelarize.
9249 2018-05-12 17:21:48 I like how you publicly owned in inverted commas. Marc Rich explained how he set up the "state owned" oil company,sonangol & owned half of it.

9289 2018-05-12 17:16:31 We saw the Shah abadoned, we don't want interest based friends most likely cause saudi did oil embargo around 74 and shah fell in 79. It's cause saudi had no threats and leverage and I am guessing the west stood by to watch that leverage taken away with a strong Iran rising.
9290 2018-05-12 17:16:29 Ok, that I probably could do...

9318 2018-05-12 17:11:14 I’m excited about washing my hair with this tea tree oil shampoo
9319 2018-05-12 17:11:06 What's the point in making appointments at car dealerships if you still have to wait for 2+ hours for an OIL CHANGE. Ughhh i wish I knew how to do this sort of thing myself
9320 2018-05-12 17:10:48 I use olive oil and lemon  as a dressing. It’s pretty delicious

9322 2018-05-12 17:10:30 Ha ha. Let’s look at the oil prices of the North Sea barrel. Ups...It looks even weak than in 2014, then the result will be “no”.  Your “dream “ is drive by greedy not by the courage to build a nation.
9323 2018-05-12 17:10:27 My oil light came on . Just got from the VG dealer
9324 2018-05-12 17:10:22 I really hate that it takes Walmart an hour to do an oil change.  The fuck are they doing?  Having a rave?
9325 2018-05-12 17:10:20 actually his supplements he sells is good stuff, no snake oil there, I use the iodine for my type 2 diabetes, and lowered my a1c with diet too, 4 points in two weeks, my doctor said that is nearly impossible. 
just my .02 worth.
9326 2018-05-12 17:10:09 Yep, Union Bank got the Nazi gold for war debt. With no gold left, the world switched to the Petrodollar. We almost have all the oil and our military is in 91% on the worlds nations.

9331 2018-05-12 17:09:57 Russian TV says this will be very lucrative to drive up oil prices, which will help Russian economy.
9332 2018-05-12 17:09:53 ok im about to go tan and it’s super hot outside today. does tanning oil have sun protection?..
9333 2018-05-12 17:09:49 Tea tree oil tho  no lie ! If you have dry scalp/dandruff or just an itchy scalp *not the kutu one tho*  tea tree oil just heals that mess ! I haven’t touched my scalp in days!
9334 2018-05-12 17:09:46 People can’t really blame Kelantan for not developing.

Know that they didn’t get their share for producing oil from kerajaan pusat.

Let’s see if Tun M will give them their share in this new era.
9335 2018-05-12 17:09:45 I mixed Aztec clay, a lil bit of charcoal, apple cider vinegar, a tiny bit of water and 3 drops of vitamin E oil.
9336 2018-05-12 17:09:42 I don’t understand them ooo, the country should not explorer oil and salt in their area, but they want monies from the same exploration in other regions to develop their road and other infrastructure....
9337 2018-05-12 17:09:32 Why not fund the TSA checkpoints with a tax on fossil fuels?  Since wars over oil is why we need the TSA  anyway?

9345 2018-05-12 17:08:28 OIL de Cristobal Lopez era accionista de C5N y de unos cuantos medios más. Y vos le crees a esos? O le crees a Clarín que tiene mas manchas que ub tigre. Somos gente grande estamos en Argentina no en Harvard

9350 2018-05-12 17:07:38 I keep coming back to 'The Oil Slick'.
9351 2018-05-12 17:07:37 The great people of Iran are largely suppressed and in SUPPORT of this withdrawal.  It's the regime in control that has gotten rich, pursued their agenda and impoverished their people while sitting on an ocean of oil and money.  Mark, again is correct.
9352 2018-05-12 17:07:30 Mint oil makes an excellent natural insect repellent. There are some awesome ideas on this thread.
9353 2018-05-12 17:07:22 i did it too but i only did it every other night or twice a week. also use an oil (coconut or almond or something moisturizing) to prevent it from drying your skin too bad.

9371 2018-05-12 17:05:01 My worry these days is that the "extra virgin olive oil" in things like this really is olive oil and not a disguised nasty seed oil. Feel like I can't trust anything out there 
9372 2018-05-12 17:05:01 MCT oil can help people get over this short term transition.
9373 2018-05-12 17:04:59 Tell me what you are "resisting". The tax cuts? The improving economy? The lowest unemployment rate ever including for blacks and Hispanics?

9374 2018-05-12 17:04:41 And apparently it needs to be fish oil, not cod liver oil due to risk of high levels of mercury! I’m just not sure on the dose? Or best place to find them as lots of the fish oils I can find online also contain vitamin A which we don’t want either

9378 2018-05-12 17:04:31 Michael McFaul, Fmr Ambassador to Russia said that pulling out of Iran deal was huge mistake .   It puts US against our Allies and China and opens the door for RUSSIA to be the stable power. Oil prices going up, good for RUSSIA and Rubel has gone up last 3days. We r isolated!
9379 2018-05-12 17:04:30 I can’t really take too much credit for this one, literally everything but salt n pepper n oil came from the kit and I just followed instructions
9380 2018-05-12 17:04:28 Walked into the car place this morning for an oil change, walked out this afternoon with new brake pads, rotors, a fluid flush (?) and now $700 (!!!!) later here we are.  Someone sedate me. Or Venmo me.
9381 2018-05-12 17:04:19 The mainstream media is only there to lie and manipulate people, and the people who believe this cant think for themselfs. The capitalists need to get the fuck out of the middle east and leave their oil alone

9383 2018-05-12 17:04:11 marinaded it in a can of guiness, cup of soy sauce, garlic, onion, chilli and lemon for 8 hours (should be more). take it out and brown it in some oil. add back the marinade and put it in the oven (add can of tomatoes). after two hours add choice of roast veg. then two hours.

9385 2018-05-12 17:03:58 Stuck in puente hills for 3 hours getting my oil changed... I could’ve done this at home
9386 2018-05-12 17:03:56 None of that includes the price when oil goes up and prices for everything in Walmart goes up. That tax cut is nothing and will cost many of the middle class more money. My taxes are going up.
9387 2018-05-12 17:03:54 That sort of thing can destroy families. The stress involved in having a very sick child. I think the only point I was making was sometimes doctors are wrong and parents can be right. The Lorenzo’s Oil story is another one.
9388 2018-05-12 17:03:52 We’re using a range of other oils & fats - sunflower, rapeseed, butter & lard. These are not perfect, and palm oil is higher yielding - BUT they don’t cause rainforest destruction. There should be a role for Palm if the industry sorts itself out & commits to zero deforestation
9389 2018-05-12 17:03:33 The only time I’ve been to Lucas oil stadium is for a graduation and a truck show....
9390 2018-05-12 17:03:25 I bought an oil for £40 signed by JR (...), reframed it for £15 and sold it for £20.

And hegemony as they are some of the last countries that still have some independence from Western Rule. Ask Wes Clark. Higher oil prices HELP Iran & Venezuela. have to “create” the “crisis” narrative.

Inceeasing coal and oil dependency does not help our environment. 

NAFTA does need revisiting but I have no faith in him negotiating anything mutually good. He is creating an isolationist nation.

True for Muslim Obama, but it's dissonant tone is off putting to American culture. Add a bit of Alinsky radical mixed with snake oil salesman. We were duped.

9416 2018-05-12 17:00:50 -There is no 'discount', that's a myth. 
-We already have a pipeline to tidewater, the existing TransMountain. 
-It doesn't magically get a better price for oil. 
-The oil loaded on tankers from that pipeline still go to the US not overseas.

It's all a con.

9421 2018-05-12 17:00:34 Just work very slowly and use lots of lube or cocout oil. It needs lots of stimulation. Just use the tips of the bigger plugs for now and find some down time to play around. Don't rush things.

When planning to get an oil change, people always look for a cheaper option thinking it doesn’t make much difference. 
TYPES OF OILS
There are basically two major types of oils regular oil and synthetic oil. Regular oil is distilled an

9428 2018-05-12 16:59:09 Even India exports little food to Iran. There are grains, another low caloric crop and then there is oil, fabric and jewelry.

To keep Iran fed, they need a more agriculturally robust trade partner.

That would require the U.S. or Latin America or a EU consensus involving the UK

9440 2018-05-12 16:57:36 what do you describe as "welfare"? Medicaid paying for long term  eldercare? CHIP..healthcare for children? Heating oil subsidies for fixed income retirees & working poor? Meals on wheels? Head Start? Nutrition Centers for elderly? Disability benefits?
9441 2018-05-12 16:57:24 That's your dream world, kid. That's not how the oil & gas industry works. We were well on our way to electric in the 1970s, but that progress got 'intervened' heavily. We're starting all over again & that's because the desire for it is increased b/c science advises it.
9442 2018-05-12 16:57:18 I'm not drawing so long (from january), so I've never tried oil or acril or ink. I'd like to try them someday.
9443 2018-05-12 16:56:57 True, the President generally has nothing to do with this, unless the take special action. Under Obama, the special action was to reduce prices by opening up the oil reserves. Later prices went down because the Saudis didn't like us becoming independent from OPEC oil. So they...

9446 2018-05-12 16:56:04 Cost of gas goes up 10 cents, bring “big oil” before congress and demand answers...cost of education goes up 498%, not a peep to bring in “big education” to explain..

9454 2018-05-12 16:55:34 I love how you Dont believe in renewable resources or climate change. And want to keep things the way they are, and keep us working heavily with arab nations for oil rich nations. It's like you shoot yourself in the foot with every comment.
9455 2018-05-12 16:55:32 Shoutout to breezy for the essential beard oil.
9456 2018-05-12 16:55:04 Such as bathing appears to you - oil, sweat, dirt, filthy water, all disgusting - so is every part of life and everything.  Marcus Aurelius

9462 2018-05-12 16:53:59 No Oprah, either. She may be a far better person than Trump, but she is no more proven as a competent legislator. She has promoted charlatans over and over and is directly responsible for the notoriety of Dr. Oz, the biggest snake oil salesman of them all.
9463 2018-05-12 16:53:57 I’m boycotting all hair products this summer, just water and maybe some argon oil. Need to let my hat breath and do its thing

エキストラバージンオリーブオイルとはオリーブの果実を搾ってろ過しただけのバージンオイルです。
9482 2018-05-12 16:51:14 Canada is a net exporter of oil. And what little is imported mostly comes from the US but I suppose the US isn't any better than Saudi Arabia these days
9483 2018-05-12 16:51:14 Congress is really in the Oil Business, John Kerry and John McCain are very Oily.
9484 2018-05-12 16:51:07 Good question as there is no ‘perfect’ alternative. But we have been very careful about our replacements - sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, lard & butter - which do not cause tropical rainforest destruction.
9485 2018-05-12 16:50:57 Like much of the tactics, quote without question. "Tar Sands" is a Flintstones term for the highly technical process in Oil Sands recovery.  No protest on a rail bypass to haul oil in Quebec? #Cdnpoli #greenfraud
9486 2018-05-12 16:50:54 Thanks Brad for being a champion for our beleaguered western Canadian oil industry.  Gerry loves taking potshots but his days in power are most definitely numbered. BTW, Gerry how’s the response to @fairquestions shaping up???

9514 2018-05-12 16:47:47 Please stop spreading lies & misinfo. Obama did not "pay" Iran. Countries including US, seized Iranian assets, including land, buildings, securities, bank accts, payments for oil, etc. Iranian assets were "released" by US & other countries. I'll bet U know this, but lie anyway.
9515 2018-05-12 16:47:35 How would Israel benefit from an initial public offering of Saudi oil firms? Only the US will. May be US used Israel as tool? Yes. Explains the Iran deal. This is inviting Israel to a shit storm with Russia, Iran and potentially China if need be.

9521 2018-05-12 16:46:51 We build rapid resistance to melatonin. They will work for 2 weeks or so, but then stop. Sleep issues affected much of my early twenties and made me more susceptible to seizures. Exercise, cbd oil, and lotions with magnesium chloride in it are much better for sleep than melatonin
9522 2018-05-12 16:46:48 It’s not a crucifix, it’s a pic of downtown where I live. I don’t agree w the regime of Israeli policies or all of Netanyahu lies. Basically, no more American blood for oil. Fight your own fight. BTW, God is in my soul, not on any piece of land, church, statue, etc...
9523 2018-05-12 16:46:46 I have used peppermint oil and tea tree oil as a deterrent and it's worked.

9525 2018-05-12 16:46:27 Try baby oil instead of soap/shaving cream some time. It sounds a little out there, but it actually gives the most amazing, smooth, nick free shave, ever. Get rid of dull razors right away, those are deadly for the leg nicks.

I used to “paint” w/ black ink sometimes but it would be for quick sketches of  people. No mixing involved. 
9530 2018-05-12 16:45:52 Coconut oil is a scam

9543 2018-05-12 16:44:32 @Sawbones What is tea tree oil good for? I see it as an ingredient in a lot of products and it’s advertised to be good for everything from lice to antiseptic. It seems a little fishy to me, even if the stuff smells good.

9553 2018-05-12 16:43:37 The royalty review was well-received by the oil companies, especially changes related to natural gas. The oil industry whines loudly every time it faces the prospect that what it pays the taxpayer is being reviewed. There never is a good time for the industry.

9558 2018-05-12 16:43:15 I think it's more about human trafficking then oil. Q made it very clear that oil has never been the primary objective. There is a much more evil underbelly that involves human trafficking for evil/sick purposes

9561 2018-05-12 16:42:22 The drama Trump has brought with his issue with Iran and the attendant push upwards in the price of oil is not something Nigeria should celebrate. Instead we should double down on the ongoing diversification of the economy. No time is better than now to wean ourselves from oil.
9562 2018-05-12 16:42:16 Kicked the Oil companies out and Foooked up everything!
9563 2018-05-12 16:42:14 So true. My first thought when I read this headline was “It’s TIME?” It’s been like FIVE MINUTES!!
9564 2018-05-12 16:42:14 That came about because of quite sudden US oil independence, made possible by technologies developed by the oil industry itself. Bitumen is not "highly desired". It enjoys a market at a price. The decline in Mexican and Venezuelan exports to Gulf refineries has been helpful.

9595 2018-05-12 16:37:48 Don't knock it until you try it lol. It's just plain cheese pizza but with garlic and oil.

9597 2018-05-12 16:37:38 That’s how you’re supposed to do it. Sesame oil, butter, and seasoning. Boil the broth, add the noodles.
9598 2018-05-12 16:37:34 All those pipelines and drilling platforms were for what then?
To allow oil companies to ship oil abroad and gouge the domestic consumer.
9599 2018-05-12 16:37:06 You’re not the first one to mention coconut oil! I’m really gonna have to try it out. Thanks girl!!

9601 2018-05-12 16:36:49 The NDP control the price of oil? High extraction costs and low oil prices killed investment in Alberta. The world is changing and the rollercoaster needs to stop. That doesn't mean turning off the taps, but it means planning for the future.
9602 2018-05-12 16:36:44 All these resources in my beautiful country ( diamonds oil copper emeralds gold) all being sold to foreigners  my people will forever suffer if things don’t change man 
9603 2018-05-12 16:36:42 An intravenous vitamin-corticosteroid cocktail some had called "snake  oil" is now the subject of two large studies after a Virginia doctor  found it to be an effective treatment for sepsis, the leading cause of  death in American hospitals,
9604 2018-05-12 16:36:31 @meinekecarcare I scheduled an appointment at 730 this morning.  Got bypassed by a bunch of oil changes.  And still no word on my car.  What is the point in scheduling?  Wasted my whole day.  :/
9605 2018-05-12 16:36:29 Thanks to our mat of lichen, oil.
9606 2018-05-12 16:36:15 It looks like the @AnneWaiguru model for Kibera and NYS could be replicated here. Let's not forget the late Michuki involved street persons (paying them a stipend) in the clean up of Nairobi River with astounding results. Let the youth reap employment. Coro Maai. Oil the wheels!

9608 2018-05-12 16:35:54 I've seen good results from CBD oil in some of my patients. Also no/minimal results and adverse effects in some patients.

9610 2018-05-12 16:35:24 Irans oil exports will b cut in 1/2, their money is worthless. Europeans will pull out or face the wrath of not doing business w the largest economy in the world. If they don't pull out our troops that protect them. N $80 billion
9611 2018-05-12 16:35:23 In almost every nonMuslim Countries Muslims are being oppressed. By Hindus in India, Buddist in Mayanmar, Jews in Palestime. Have you ever bomed Jews, hindus or Buddist for oil? We r true peaceful people. Hw violent you r could not tolerate Ali n Hijab.Muslims tolerating for ages
9612 2018-05-12 16:35:21 No no I've blocked them. Because they talking illogically with words like "Racism" even after clear explanation. This means they reluctant to accept the truth. There is a say you can extract oil from sand but can't change a moron. So I did it.
9613 2018-05-12 16:35:21 Serious oil o, in fact it's the new way to make fast bucks after looting itself
9614 2018-05-12 16:35:00 I used to sprinkle apple cider vinegar  on salad w tbsp of hemp oil. Enhances flavor and great EFA source.
9615 2018-05-12 16:34:58 You hit the nail on the head. Alberta is being short sighted, as well as Canada, in that, by the fact of admission, that selling off oil at a discounted rate, is giving away our resources. OPEC did not become the power it is, by discounting oil. It's bad business.
9616 2018-05-12 16:34:45 Lets get the real reason for this out there
This is Trumps reward (for his base) from Putin
Trump turfs Iran deal, Russia make billions in oil revenue
It was Putins play all along, not Russian sanctions
We were all played
9617 2018-05-12 16:34:33 Oil price raising @BrokermanDaniel should be look at your Vietnam tip #SOCO international? It said in March it continued “to pursue growth opportunities of scale” & one of the very few small caps to pay dividends
9618 2018-05-12 16:34:28 Prof. Ángel, que tal una división tipo Standard Oil en USA que derive en varias empresas, asi no es un sólo "presidente" quien concentre el control.
9619 2018-05-12 16:34:25 Hi Emma. All palm oil used in our own-label food products has come from sustainable RSPO-certified sources since 2015. This position is being extended to non-food products by the end of 2018. Thanks
9620 2018-05-12 16:34:16 I wonder how many single struggle mamas slanging ass for oil changes and haircuts for the kids
9621 2018-05-12 16:34:12 Let’s not forget the sale of Russian military equipment to Iran. This is disgusting if u think about it. Putin is going to really make billions in the sale of oil and military hardware to Iran now, almost like he gave Trump the strategy in advance.
9622 2018-05-12 16:34:10 tell me about Holy oil, please. Very interested.
9623 2018-05-12 16:34:08 went a bit wild with the olbas oil last night and now my room smells like a koala's wet dream
9624 2018-05-12 16:34:07 When oil production was at its peak, it's said that relatives of the dead who occupied space above pools of oil received royalty checks from oil companies.
9625 2018-05-12 16:33:51 You dont have to. It can come in a oil you can take orally.
9626 2018-05-12 16:33:51 For all those liberal democratic crybabies trying to say us leaving the iran deal is the reason for the rise in gas prices try again. Gas prices are up 17% threw out the year we just left the deal so sry try again. Venezeuala oil down, russia meddling with opec, so pls try again
9627 2018-05-12 16:33:50 estimates are just guesswork nothing more, the oil estimates *everyone got wrong?
9628 2018-05-12 16:33:47 Those coffee beans look like they have been dipped into some high quality crude oil.
9629 2018-05-12 16:33:38 I was diagnosed with cervical and what they thought was breast cancer 1 yr 6 months ago. I am cancer free today with out chemo without radiation without my doctor.

9630 2018-05-12 16:33:35 Funny the only ones supporting Jacob on this thread are the Botskis! That should show you who supports war in Iran - not real Americans, that's for sure. Only Vlad wants war there, it'll drive up his precious oil prices so he can make even more Rubles.
9631 2018-05-12 16:33:28 Yea I saw the Google virtual assistant, I thought it was pretty cool but super creepy. Ultimately data will be the new oil!

9634 2018-05-12 16:33:19 Haven’t figured out how to make them crispy like tostadas. But they are definitely an earthier alternative to flour tortillas for tacos. I mix water, garbanzo flour, and @beautifulbriny Hot Steve salt, then cook in olive oil in a crepe (or any non-stick) pan like pancakes.
9635 2018-05-12 16:33:14 samee, my hair used to be down my back until i cut it around July & it takes forever to grow. But i seen that Castor oil has been working for me & also not using heat on my hair as much!!
9636 2018-05-12 16:33:00 And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, “A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the oil and the wine.”

9640 2018-05-12 16:32:10 To diversify an economy you need to start from somewhere. Saudi used part of their reserve and proceeds from initial sale of their oil company to diversify their economy. Their reserve was  $737bn in August 2014 % depleted to $529bn at the end of 2016....
9641 2018-05-12 16:32:08 Lol my mom’s korean but she did this for me as a kid all the time. Add sesame oil too and it is delish
9642 2018-05-12 16:32:01 I like mealkit instructions that tell me to heat the oil in the pan "until hot". Hot to whom? My hand in it? Nice bath temperature? Hot to the oil itself? How does one measure it objectively anyway? Meat thermometer doesn't touch enough. Until splattering everywhere?
9643 2018-05-12 16:31:49 Be that sunflower that soaks up the oil and makes it into pure energy in order to keep growing

9644 2018-05-12 16:31:36 The only promises kept have been to lobbyists from chemical, oil, coal, military industrialists, insurance and pharma. You literally ARE the SWAMP.
9645 2018-05-12 16:31:35 Yes! Time to go anklet and body oil shopping
9646 2018-05-12 16:31:31 There weren't many tall derricks left whwn I was a kid; real estate within 5 miles of the coast had become more valuable than oil fields. But rocking horses and refinery torches were normal.

9650 2018-05-12 16:30:39 Moody's, in confirming its "stable" outlook for T&T, said on May 10th, 2018: "A sustained increase in oil and gas production, which materially improves medium-term economic growth prospects would potentially lead to an upgrade"

9660 2018-05-12 16:29:03 Where’s the business case that shows how much more Asia is willing to pay for heavy oil than what AB is already getting from the US? What are the costs of getting it all the way over there with the Aframax size restrictions? Still worth it? Now subtract the political costs!

9664 2018-05-12 16:28:37 I think an oil change is the cheaper option of the two

9697 2018-05-12 16:24:53 Temporary pipeline construction jobs, and security work along the pipeline does not equate into long term economic gain. It doesn’t take many to load an oil tanker at Westridge and that tanker crew heading to Asia isn’t Canadian. Lots of benefits for the oil companies though huh?

9701 2018-05-12 16:24:35 A second big cause of fossil fuel dependence (specifically _oil_ dependence) is the rise of car-dependent urban sprawl. To solve that, we need to intervene in the economics of land...

9704 2018-05-12 16:24:08 2/. Sure you can have worker owned means of production.  But that’s not what Venezuela has created - except to a small degree.  It’s goal was to use its oil wealth in similar way as Norway.  Why did it fail where Norway succeeded is the question.  Rube.
9705 2018-05-12 16:23:57 That is why green energy is a core defense strategy. The Big Oil economy is feeding the cancer.

9707 2018-05-12 16:23:47 Yes, Ontario has a lower growth rate % than BC and Alberta. I think we were 4th last year?
The provinces with higher growth rates were entirely due to oil prices climbing.
Ontario grew in stable long term areas.

9719 2018-05-12 16:22:09 A soft #Brexit would lead to chronic instability. The right-wing and their press allies would rant about being a vassal state, while Remainers also angered by our rule-taker status would press hard to rejoin the EU. The UK is not a small oil, gas & fishing economy like Norway.

9725 2018-05-12 16:21:43 ... the replacement oil could be grown in temperate areas, not tropical forest which has at least 4-10x the biodiversity of temperate habitats. You are comparing apples with oranges. I’d have thought a supermarket might know the difference.

9727 2018-05-12 16:21:36 I got Theanine right at Wal-Mart. I mix it with 1 mg of Melatonin and works great. But I actually think you should try the CBD oil first
9728 2018-05-12 16:21:35 Yes oil and the market will both crater that are dollar will continue
9729 2018-05-12 16:21:15 つか、最近は色んな会社から人が出ていってるって噂聞くから、この数年で経営力が無い所は一気に落ちぶれそう、新しい会社ほどまともだったりするし

中には社内状況知ってやっと仕事を取る量考え直したって会社もあるみたいだけど
9730 2018-05-12 16:21:04 If you like paprika, then try it on sweet potatoes. I chop them into cubes, cover lightly with olive oil, paprika, sea salt and cracked pepper. Bake for 35-40 mins. Then become one with the potato gods!
9731 2018-05-12 16:21:02 เป็นบ้า
9732 2018-05-12 16:20:56 Putin needs the price of oil to go up.  Trump will obey.  And Trump doesn't give a shit how many soldiers get to die.  Netanyahu appreciates it too.....
9733 2018-05-12 16:20:49 I was telling my story earlier of working on an oil rig off the coast of Sable Island. No union there. They literally did not care if we lived or died or were injured. Plenty more where we came from!
9734 2018-05-12 16:20:46 มันเปิดให้แก้ไขได้แล้วหรอคะ
9735 2018-05-12 16:20:43 I love the guys at the auto body shop I have been going to for 3 years, I’m in sweats and they are like, “Miss Natalie, you are GLOWING, didn’t know you could get more beautiful!” I feel like a queen getting my oil changed 
9736 2018-05-12 16:20:35 Kinda odd that the real winner here is Russian power in the Middle East, higher oil prices helping the Russian economy, and a new tension between NATO allies once again helping Russia. But don’t worry NO COLLUSION *facepalm*
9737 2018-05-12 16:20:34 You could make a herbal oil yourself . I was reading saw palmetto , stinging nettle, and horsetail all help your hair grow like crazy. Maybe you could try that
9738 2018-05-12 16:20:12 Alaskans get to share the wealth of the state by receiving a share from oil profits.

I see nothing wrong with that idea at all and last time I looked Alaska is still in the union still operate under capitalism. NEOCONS will go crazy if this applied every U S citizen
9739 2018-05-12 16:20:09 good grief. My first thought is what does it do to the land-& to the underlying ground-to put those in, suck out so much oil & then, what? tear them down & walk away?
9740 2018-05-12 16:20:07  oil in Golan heights? shire maybe the Druze population pissing oil 
9741 2018-05-12 16:20:04 lol could be kind of a carbon offset thing for all those cars, oil and gas drilling in Cali...
9742 2018-05-12 16:19:59 ไปดูในเน็ตว่าอะไรลบรอบแผลเป็นได้ ไปเจอว่า BIO OIL ดีเลยซื้อมาขวดนึง ตอนนี้รู้ละว่าไม่ควรซื้อมาทา ควรซื้อมาอาบแทน ถถถถถ แผลเป็นในตัวเยอะมากจนไบโอออยพร่องไปละ นี่แค่วันแรกนะ
9743 2018-05-12 16:19:49 "And when the multitude saw the former oil executive bowing down before the King of Oil, all the people were amazed. Not."
9744 2018-05-12 16:19:48 Potatoes even better when they are fried in lots of oil!!!
9745 2018-05-12 16:19:48 Coconut oil on my face so heavenly
9746 2018-05-12 16:19:42 I know supporting city for 5 years gives you some right to think you know something about football but we all know ur only relevant cuz of dirty oil money 
9747 2018-05-12 16:19:40 Very upset. Had my bathing suit on and tanning oil on hand but my pool is still closed
9748 2018-05-12 16:19:39 (7 liters olive oil + 1 kg caustic soda + water + 2 hours) × 3 = enough soap for 2 for one year - (wierd ingredients + perfumes + transport costs) = less hassle really
9749 2018-05-12 16:19:33 ก็เห็นมัน มีคำว่ายังไง มันไม่ใช่คำถามตรงไหม ผมไปเองดีกว่า คุณฉลาดน้อยเกินไปอ่า ตั้งคำถามแต่ไม่รู้ว่าเป็นคำถาม @NitiphatTode ช่วยกูดูอาการทียูตะเขาเป็นไร

9751 2018-05-12 16:19:23 A hot oil treatment is my hair's best friend 
9752 2018-05-12 16:19:18 9/11 happened in America and look where that led to in the Middle East. No country can attack America on her soil!!! You are talking about world war 3 if that happens. NK was a wild card and they had to be put in check. Iran's next move is predictable cos they wanna sell oil.
9753 2018-05-12 16:19:05 I know all about it already.  I read Sinbad and the 40 Islamics when I was kid and they all got stuck in vats of boiling oil.  Speak about nightmares!  Aye that was a kids' fairy tale then, but kind of gave us a glimpse into the future.
9754 2018-05-12 16:19:00 オイルbotって何⁇とよく聞かれますが、…オイルはオイルですYO
9755 2018-05-12 16:19:00 Maybe Korean food is kind of like Olive Oil for the Russian mob?
9756 2018-05-12 16:18:59 canola oil stan be QUIET.
9757 2018-05-12 16:18:48 Still the consummate snake oil salesman.
9758 2018-05-12 16:18:44 รักหมดใจ
9759 2018-05-12 16:18:43 Soaring oil prices will bring an early demise to ego driven campaign. I see a total choatic Interim government, blame game will go on for years. Better to go to IMF, austerity, devaluation, higher interest rates and lower growth rate, structural reforms and privatization.
9760 2018-05-12 16:18:26 Well gas prices are based on crude oil prices and crude oil hit a 2 and a half year high in January usually u can expect to see a change five to six months later so here we are.

Oh and they are just gonna keep going up too so be prepared for that.
9761 2018-05-12 16:18:23 Marcelito...cuando cobraste en U$D los spots de #Oil  comprabas la #lechuga con los #precioscuidados de Kici y el #IndeK de Moreno?

9764 2018-05-12 16:18:15 I always put sesame oil on my rice. Is it also whitest?
9765 2018-05-12 16:18:14 Gold is not inert. It's relation to commodities is also elastic. Gold gets revalued in real terms from time to time. ie gold could go to 10k in 2010 dollars. 10k US gold does not mean $1000 oil.
9766 2018-05-12 16:18:09 Its oil and gas money  v everyone else

But you have 2 owners who don't spend a single penny on investment on the team
9767 2018-05-12 16:17:30 I'm glad I've been taking my CBD oil cause if not I'd be stressed the f out over what's happening on Instagram. It's been a shit storm since last night. Constant negative comments but it was it is, Im gonna keep doing what I love
9768 2018-05-12 16:16:54 ดึกแล้วเดี๋ยวแม่ตี
9769 2018-05-12 16:16:54 Uh huh, and how much oil do we get from #Iran? Guess who is going to start pumping more to make up for “part” if the shortfall? Saudi Arabia. And guess where 11 of the 14 terrorists were from? Saudi Arabia
1. Fuck the Muslim ban
2. Trump’s global policies is #IdioCRAZY
9770 2018-05-12 16:16:52 That fish oil stinks
9771 2018-05-12 16:16:44 Loser liberals? What about your loser son who's a modern day snake oil salesman...let's see his achievements as a "financier":
—advertised his services on CRAIGSLIST.
—lost 50 percent of his investor’s money in a month.
—had 13 clients with about 500k in total assets.
9772 2018-05-12 16:16:40 A lot of Americans have contempt for the base. They are not letting the country progress, they want to stay in yesterday while the rest of the world moved on! Coal dead- fact, oil won't last for ever- fact, we have to move forward because there's no future in yesterday!
9773 2018-05-12 16:16:38 Punishment for idiots who leave little children in a hot car to bake to death: fry them in a vat of boiling oil.
9774 2018-05-12 16:16:36 Not a fan of rose water.  The last thing I have yet to restock for now is oil for OCM!
9775 2018-05-12 16:16:34 Call it what you. the money made via oil and gas  goes to the Feds and is recycled.Where do people think that growth (jobs and CRA revenue receipts) came from during 2000 - 2014 in this country?This is a well understood issue in Canada.  Especially Alberta and Saskatchewan.
9776 2018-05-12 16:16:32 Feel sick. Couldn't even get my oil changed today. Gonna have to wake up early Monday
9777 2018-05-12 16:16:31 555 ไปหาอย่างอื่นมาคุยมั่ง คุณยูตะ แล้วก็ที่ผมสอบผ่านเพราะ เครื่องมันตรวจผ่านอ่า คุณจะถามเอาไรอ่า ว่าผ่านมาได้ไง

(In olive oil, acrescento eu.)
9780 2018-05-12 16:16:07 2. in your ‘Alternatives to palm oil’ section you suggest palm oil is the highest-yielding oil crop (4-10x more oil/ha) and replacing palm oil with other oils might result in more forests being converted into agricultural land but ...
9781 2018-05-12 16:16:02 do you think shipping oil by rail is safer?
9782 2018-05-12 16:15:59 I use that and this money shea oil
9783 2018-05-12 16:15:58 Snake oil... we all need to wake up and educate ourselves. The world is changing and our role is changing within it. That’s part of the reason this is happening. Automation will redefine how we live. We need to fully understand the implications because Mercer and the Koch’s do.
9784 2018-05-12 16:15:49 This bastard brushed my car and he said “we’re both at fault”. The alighted from the car and said “shebi engine oil can clean it”. That statement set me off. A lot of mad people in this Lagos I swear.
9785 2018-05-12 16:15:46 Combine 4 1/2 tbsps enchilada with 2 1/2 pints bread. Sprinkle with Olive Oil. Stir-fry. Serve with love.
9786 2018-05-12 16:15:44 Your statement is 50% incorrect.  “Pipeline radicalism” does not force us to “buy high from dictators.”  You are right with the point it causes lower profits for oil industry because they could get more money by transporting to Asian markets then selling at a discount to US...
9787 2018-05-12 16:15:43 ang bad ng effect sakin ng tea tree oil jusq :-((((((
9788 2018-05-12 16:15:31 What kind of stain is it? Oil, dirt, etc.
9789 2018-05-12 16:15:26 A simplistic view. Take away religion  and humans will still fight over race, ethnicity, land, oil, water, money... take your pick
9790 2018-05-12 16:15:19 Wailmer, the Antenna Pokémon. It can even flatten steel oil drums.
9791 2018-05-12 16:15:16 Loco, necesito entradas para fuel oil, alguien que tenga????????
9792 2018-05-12 16:15:14 It's not just trade. The Saudi's famously signed the petrol dollar agreement with the US (which is a model for all oil exporting countries) where they have to convert their currency to dollars in order to buy/sell oil, maintaining the US's currency position.
9793 2018-05-12 16:14:50 When the EU, Russia and China negotiate with OPEC to trade oil in Euros instead of US dollars, we will not only be weaker we will be much poorer.

We will be a country of a few, very, very wealthy people & a lot of very poor people.

Think of cold war Russia. That's our future.
9794 2018-05-12 16:14:50 Wondering why my skin smell like weed and I haven’t smoked in a monthit’s my body oil and lotion mixture 
9795 2018-05-12 16:14:44 Oil marketing companies were holding back on revising their prices since April 24 despite surge in crude prices and rupee depreciation, says an ET report, warning prices may go up by Rs 1.50 per litre immediately after Karnataka polls. But yeah, let's hope!
9796 2018-05-12 16:14:44 Oil cleanser coba beb

9800 2018-05-12 16:14:29 I'm not sure! I put a Lg cast iron in a 375oven to preheat while I mixed, put a touch of coconut oil in the hot pan & poured her batter in..then I took a shower lol

at least 25-30 b4 they set in the middle? Pan size prob matters a lot...sm sheet tray prob works too-good luck! 
9801 2018-05-12 16:14:16 WH "communications team" out of sync, out of oil, out of tune, but probably not out of leaks.  I think that's what Sarah Huckabee Sanders is complaining about. As someone we know might say, "We'll see."
9802 2018-05-12 16:14:13 Must have been quite fast - and uphill.  They just missed the house next door to it too - but I suspect both properties may be affected by the oil spill.  At least no one was hurt.
9803 2018-05-12 16:13:54 Now let's see for how many more days oil prices are controlled. They (Govt.) have controlled it for 15 days and now when the polling is over how long will they take to pass the burden to the consumer.

9842 2018-05-12 16:09:57 It also speaks to how far most people are from most national decisions - I dont go to national parks, but feel vibrantly they should exist without oil rigs in them. A lot of people? Dont go, and also don't care. The stuff he's actually doing only bothers a small group at a time.
9843 2018-05-12 16:09:51 Apparently I’m taking my kids to Wits tomorrow to check out bugs and creepy crawlies. I’ll be the dad armed with citronella oil and doom.

9847 2018-05-12 16:09:16 USA is the largest producer of oil, has reserves greater than Saudi A., owns the technology (fracking) to make it better yet -- and this hotshot thinks anyone gives a shit about Iranian releasing or not releasing their crude into world markets. Dope still reading Paul Ehrlich.
9848 2018-05-12 16:09:02 @WSJ Why am I forced to see a crude oil ticker stop my wsj page when logged in? That real estate could be displaying selectable indicators that I care about. Reach out if you want implementation tips or to discuss why this is a win for you AND your customers.
9849 2018-05-12 16:09:02 Focus isn't the same thing as actual progress. He sits on his ass most of day. But unless you have had your head in the sand for the past year, this admin is upside down. He is an idiot. Not even useful to Russia anymore, except to play with oil prices to improve their oconomy.

9854 2018-05-12 16:08:50 We get about 4% of our oil from Iraq, before the war we got a little more.  China is the biggest beneficiaries of Iraq oil.  Research is much better then getting your info from #AMJoy

9866 2018-05-12 16:07:36 esteemed @realDonaldTrump, if you overthrow Nicolas Maduro, eliminate all his government train and imprison all the chavistas that flee, the people of venezuela is committed to give the US 5 years of free oil and 5 years more than 50% of the market price.
9867 2018-05-12 16:07:33 Thank Cheney, Rice & Shrub for not listening to the UN Inspectors on the ground in Iraq, buying into shitty cia info & listening to the oil companies urging invasion. Then think about the over 4500 mil. who died for nothing & the over 125K Iraqi to include women & children.
9868 2018-05-12 16:07:32 ...is that oil sands mega-project CAPEX is down because there are better/faster ways to make money in the oil business, tight oil being one.

9875 2018-05-12 16:06:52 I make one like this! I will sometimes add a little shredded Celeriac to add a different layer of flavour. If I want a creamier finish I substitute some of the oil for equal quantities of 0% Greek Yoghurt. Either way, it’s nicer than the mayo version which tastes only of mayo....
9876 2018-05-12 16:06:48 John Dumelo told you this on WhatsApp? Sometimes you guys want to look mature by sounding deep, but rather end up looking childish. Not everytime deep, life is not all about looking for crude oil.
